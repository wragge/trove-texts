The growth of our cities is obvious to anybody who walks along the
streets. Each new structure symbolizes the continuing expansion of
Australia, and behind each building, old or new, Olympic cables will
be at work in telephone lines, in the lighting and air-conditioning
systems, in fact as the electrical sinews of the modern office.
In the past few years, Olympic Cables have more than doubled their
capacity to service the needs of commerce.
Olympic Cables is a member of the all-Australian Olympic Group

Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
'63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the "63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this reasonable price and in
the light of possible future
shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying '64
this year, you save some 20 to
30 cents a bottle.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
"62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been '54, '57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
For Wally Hoysted,
the whips are
well and truly out
WALKING UP Flinders Street last
week, your correspondent noticed a
furniture van parked outside Ball and
Welch. On one side there was a picture
of the three monkeys and the words
“The VRC see no excess flogging,”
“Hear no excess flogging,” “Say no
excess flogging.”
On the other was a splendidly pro-
duced sign which took up the entire
side of the van. Stop the flogging.
Caulfield 4-3-67. The Snowburner, hit
30 times. Garcon, hit 22 times. Barsac,
hit 20 times. Hantu, Opinion, Citius,
Mountain Gold, Narrugi, Red Cap,
Ballet Dancer, hit many times. More
floggings named Thursday.
It was signed “W. J. Hoysted,” the
now-famous anti-flogger. With a note
left on the steering wheel, asking if
Mr. Hoysted would please telephone,
we then proceeded to do some digging.
Hoysted has always said that he was
a successful jockey until, at 17, he grew
too large. But it was possible to find
only one reference to the jockey Hoy-
sted. It was in the “Sun News-Pic-
torial,” and dated June 5, 1928. “While
the ordinary schoolboy is earning a
shilling or two for digging the garden
or minding the baby, young Wally Hoy-
sted, 14 years, son of the Mentone
trainer F. W. Hoysted, is earning sums
that would make the average man green
with envy. He has ridden 38 winners,
including two at the VRC Birthday
meeting. The young rider’s winning
percentages for the weekend were £45.
He has earned hundreds of pounds
from his 38 wins.”
Soon after we finished this research,
the “youngster” himself arrived, Walter
Hoysted, now 53. He was a lean, grey-
haired, bespectacled • man in blue suit,
Mue tie, and white shirt. He was a
gentle, mild man who might have been
the local vicar.
It was difficult to imagine him as
the man who would hold up a horse
race at Flemington with a shotgun. It
as difficult to imagine him, too, as
the man who would threaten to stage
a sit-down strike of 100 sympathisers
on the track, defy the courts, and be
sentenced to a month in jail on a
charge of having “maliciously threatened
t° Prevent the running of a horse race
at Flemington by obstructing the track
with an assemblage of persons.”
Actually, he spent his time in one of
our more amiable Victorian jails, Her
Majesty’s Morwell River Reforestation
Prison, once described as a collection
of bright blue-and-white wooden huts,
some with lace curtains at the windows
and flowers around the doors.
Mr. Hoysted sat down. It was im-
portant to know why he was doing this.
“I get called a crank,” he said. “I get
called a publicity-seeker. I detest pub-
licity and so does my wife. I don’t give
a damn what they think. I believe every
creature on this earth has a right to live
decently and to be treated decently.
Cruelty to horses is just one step in the
thing, something I can do something
about, because I know a little about
horses. But life everywhere is being
ruined by people who are hungry for
the dollar. People are not interested in
nature any more, they destroy animals
for their own purposes. A great propor-
tion of our young people are growing
up now without ever experiencing the
joy, say, of looking at a willie wagtail.”
Clearly, Mr. Hoysted is not as wealthy
as he was when he was 14. Although
he is a member of one of Australia’s
most famous racing families, he has no
car, no telephone, and he drives a
truck. “I have never been interested
in making money. I am paying off a
block of land next to my house, where
the birds can live. Anyone who plants
a tree is doing good in the world.”
So let’s have an accounting. So far,
he says his campaign has cost him
$l6OO, but of this $6OO has come from
well-wishers. He received one cheque
of $5O from the U.S. The furniture
van which makes its appearances in
the city several times a week cost him
a flat payment of $250. He changes
his posters weekly to give the very
latest bulletins on the floggings. So far
he has spent $lOO on them they are
professionally done by a friend for $lO
each.
One couldn’t help but be sceptical
about his score of floggings. After all,
“Not bad —I got round the course in
65 strokes!”
he had been warned off the course at
Flemington. “I have taken great care
to be accurate about this,” he said. “I
go to all the city meetings, except
Flemington, but then I can watch on
TV. The times are staggered on the
various channels and there are repeats.
I can see the same race four times
on Saturday and a fifth time on
‘World of Sport’ on Sunday.” One had
forgotten the utter devotion of Mel-
burnian television to horse-racing.
“I don’t object so much,” he said,
“if a horse is hit only once or twice.
This will make him go. But you cannot
make a horse go faster by hitting him
over and over again. I have seen horses
beaten 50 times in the one race. With
Discretion was hit 40 times at Caul-
field, and 60 times at Moonee Valley
within a fortnight. That horse was in
such a bad state it had to struggle
to get past the winning post.
“I have to be careful in my counting,
because there are people who are out
to get me. I have kept a record of all
the beatings in the metropolitan area
in the past year. I’ll tell you the good
jockeys. Roy Higgins never hits more
than two or three times. He looks as
if he’s hitting but he’s not; only wav-
ing in the air.
“Higgins is not mentioned in my
notes. Hyland is never mentioned. Billy
Smith is never mentioned. Johnson is
mentioned only twice and Harry White
is mentioned only twice. Do you see
what I mean? These jockeys win three
times as many races as the others put
together.”
We discussed how much the whip
hurt. Mr. Hoysted brought forward his
argument that the skin of a horse was
as sensitive as that of a human. He
had photographs of whippings. There
was his challenge that if any whipping
enthusiast was prepared to take 20
strokes on the bare back he would
give $2OO to charity.
Now Walter Hoysted is planning
what he will do next. He could, he
says, take his advertising campaign a
step further and get a large van the
size of a Greyhound bus. He had one
sign in mind. There would be a chariot
race depicting the drivers flogging their
horses and under that “Barbarians,
8.C.” Then on the other side there
would be three jockeys with their whips
upraised and the line “Jockeys, 1967.”
“But,” he said, “I think it might be
more sensible to conserve my resources
for a really big Oscar Wilde effort. First
I will have to put my affairs in order,
and provide for my wife, because this
will mean the calling in of QCs and
everything. What I plan to do is to
libel certain people to such an extent
that they will have to take me to
court. There, in front of a jury, I
think I can really achieve something.
I know what I am doing and I know
I will win.”
So there’s a warning to the VRC.
Wally Hoysted is the most gently
determined man this correspondent has
met.

CELLAR MANAGER:
BIN 2955 Reserve
Riesling
HUNTER RIVER VALLEY
This wine was made from Riesling
grapes and is a dry, delicate wine, with
an attractive bouquet and flavour. At
the 1966 Brisbane Show it was awarded
SILVER MEDAL in the export table
dry white class. 1966 vintage.
BIN 2965 Reserve
Verdelhao
HUNTER RIVER VALLEY
Made from Verdelhao and Riesling
grapes grown at Lindeman’s Sunshine
Vineyard, Bin 2965 has a very strong
flavour, typical of the Verdelhao grape.
Due to late vintaging it retains con-
siderable grape fruitiness. At the same
time it has excellent Hunter River
character and will continue developing
for jnany years. 1966 vintage.
BIN 3012 Reserve
Porphyry
HUNTER RIVER VALLEY
Semilion, the classic Sauternes grapes
of France grown at Lindeman’s Ben
Ean Vineyard, were used to make Bin
3012. It is a luscious sweet table wine
that is an ideal accompaniment to all
dessert dishes. 1965 vintage.
BIN 2990 Reserve
Spatlese Moselle
SILVER MEDAL winner for 1966
Vintage Moselle type dry white, at the

GREATEST

CELLAR
MASTER
A lofty view of
the future of
our wine industry
I’M FLYING like a bird in gliding
flight, wafted on the Clipper-ed wings
of Pan American. San Francisco lies
ahead. Is it two, three or four in the
morning? Having dined and wined
(first-class Bordeaux, good Meursalt,
and Lindemans Coolalta) as well as I
could in Sydney, 4 feel pleasantly re-
laxed, remote.
Being free, I can appraise. Being
removed, I can be dispassionate on this
question: what is the future of wine in
Australia? In a word, great. But that,
of course, doesn’t paint the full pic-
ture . . .
Australia is, per capita, a greater wine-
consuming nation than the United
States, Canada, New Zealand, and the
United Kingdom. And by a long
bottle, too. At 1.34 gallons per head, per
year, we enjoy twice as much as the
British and three times as much as the
Americans.
Yet we are by no means a wine-
drinking nation compared with the
French and Italians, who consume more
than 30 gallons per head. An average
of 200 bottles per year per person!
Obviously they do not drink much beer.
They wouldn’t have time!
But even at 1.34 gallons, our present
consumption is well below what it was
at one time but there is an explan-
ation for the change. Before the war
we drank less than a gallon a head.
By the late ’forties it was nearly l two
gallons each. This sudden popularity
of wine was related to an acute short-
age of beer and spirits. Once these
became readily available, wine sales
dropped to almost their former level,
and only the comparatively recent in-
terest in table wine has lifted them
again.
But this interest is a strong one,
and will no doubt be sustained. Present
home consumption is nine million-odd
gallons of sherry and dessert wine, and
six million gallons of table wine. While
the increase of sales of fortified wines
nas barely matched our population ex-
pansion, table wine sales have trebled
in ten years. And they will double
again in the next few years.
This is my first prediction: by 1970-
72 we will be consuming at least 20
million gallons a year, half of it table
wines. By 1980 this could be 40 mil
lion gallons, with 25 million gallons of
it table wine.
Bacchus knows what else after! But
a per capita consumption of five gal.
lons per head is not outside the realms
of possibility, and by the ’eighties and
’nineties this could mean sales of 100
million gallons!
How can this come about? The in.
creased appreciation of flagon wines
and the unpretentious enjoyment of
them are major factors. Young people
like and understand wine and, as a
good friend of mine puts it, “are cut-
ting through the layers of bull laid on
by the mystified connoisseurs of the
1930-50 era.” Flagon wines are clean
light, sound, and ordinary. One doesn't
have to dissect grape types, or ponder
about the sunny side of the north-west
slope. One just drinks the stuff, and
enjoys it.
Which is precisely what the French
and Italians, the 30-gallon men, do.
New styles will also become popular.
Many sections of the industry are look-
ing into the consumption future through
rose-colored glasses. Rose wine, after
years of inattention, has finally become
established and undoubtedly will attract
even more popularity. As interest in-
creases, output goes up, and the stan-
dard improves. And improved stan-
dards mean improved sales. A virtuous
circle!
Sparkling wine sales will increase,
too. Our champagnes are becoming
more and more popular, and we all
know what happened to the casting of
pearls to the market. Something in
between is needed a dry, clean,
slightly fruity, sparkling wine that will
be cheaper than champagne (and bet-
ter than some so-called) yet slightly
better quality, and therefore dearer,
than the sweetish pearl types. Some-
thing like the German Sekt. People
always did like lots of Sekts.
Carafe wine sales, where allowed,
will increase. In many restaurants of
the future, a full carafe will be placed
on the table as soon as the customers
are seated and included, as part of
the meal, in the price. No knowledge-
able discussion of vintage and region
will follow. But a good time will be
had by all.
The fortified wine situation should not
be ignored. Sales of the standards will
always be maintained. These wines
are wholesome, well made (and often
surprisingly well matured), and reason-
ably priced. They do not deteriorate
quickly and stand-by well, excellent for
the popping-in of friends, for the cap-
ping of night, and the lifting of the
sagging spirit. They have come out of
the wardrobe on to the sideboard.
Premium-quality fortified wines will
sell far more as they become better
understood for their sheer quality. Con-
sumption of Fino sherry, the fuller
Amontillados, rich, full, sweet sherries
of the Nutty Brown style, luscious


The right moment
is everything...
. . . especially with wine, and especially with Orlando Blue
Ribbon "Spaetlese" Barossa Riesling. The right moment to
discover this superb, fruity white wine is to sip it, chilled,
with melon and ice cream, strawberries or any other sweet dish.
From the sweet crisp palate you will then appreciate why this
"late picking" white wine has been such a consistent Gold
Medal winner both in Australia and overseas.

fVmeur Muscats (at present sadly
underrated) and both Ports will in-
crease. There are signs of this already,
C rticularly with the delicate sherries
and Tawny Port. Vintage Port, and
its unsedimental brother LBV (Late
Bottled Vintage), must become more
nopular. There is just too much quality,
flavor, and guts there to be ignored.
Export sales will expand and in-
crease. The traditional market in the
U,K. will not grow greatly, and our
top-quality wines will always suffer
from the inborn, carefully perpetrated,
an d slightly supercilious snobbery that
exists there.
New markets will be opened in the
Far East, though marketing problems
are immense. The one-brand idea seems
to have been discarded through inter-
company frictions, which is a pity. I
would like to see one-label marketing
well promoted to make wine instantly
recognisable as coming from Australia.
The standard label would bear the in-
dividual company name and the wine
or grape type. In this way national
image could be exploited and company
pride retained. Merchandising and
advertising moneys could be pooled
and the savings would be immense. I
give the idea to the wine industry and
Department of Trade for nothing.
Back to local table wine sales. The
flagon and lower-priced wines are go-
ing to be accepted more freely by more
sections of the community. These wines
will be light, clean, and perhaps become
slightly fruitier and less acid. Their
price will remain fairly constant and
low.
The price of premium-quality wines
from the top grape varieties will con-
tinue to rise. Indeed, the only likely
control on these prices will be the
availability of pleasant, but by no means
extraordinary, imported wines, with
fine Gothic labels and fancy names, at
reasonable prices. I have watched with
alarm the lack of palate discrimination
applied to some of these wines as
people drink the labels but they
do provide a brake on other rising
prices.
Eventually, perhaps, we will recog-
nise the supreme quality of some of
our top wines, and, by paying extra,
encourage wine-makers to make more
and more of them. We may finally
adopt the French system of fairly low
prices for about 90 percent of our
wines and three or four times the
price for the remaining few top ones.
Retailers and restaurateurs will get
better at their jobs. This can only mean
greater availability and accessibility in
the former case and, one hopes, some
lower prices in the latter! But don’t
l°rget these people are immensely im-
portant links, and in the past five years
ave done much to improve standards
a nd spread the wine-gospel.
So all points are “Go.” Yet Australia
Produces only 40 million gallons of
wine in a good year, and more than
a “ °f this is distilled into brandy

and rectifying spirit. Where is the rest
of the wine coming from?
I predict that wine-makers and
grape - growers will become rn ore
efficient. Yields per acre of existing
grapes will increase. Conversion 0 f
present varieties to higher yielding
strains will be achieved without l oss
of quality. Varieties new to this coun-
try are being introduced, and will pl a y
a highly significant part once they are
established. Wine-making methods will
become more complex and wine-makers
will be able to “stretch” their material.
In some cases they will actually i m .
prove quality by so doing. In France,
flash heating of the grapes before fer-
mentation, and sometimes CO2 treat-
ment, are resulting in better color and
flavor extraction. The bitter-flavored
wines of old will go, and good rid-
dance!
More vineyards will continue to be
planted and new wine-makers and mer-
chants will appear on the scene. Areas,
at present not even considered, will
bear the vine and give good wine.
Perhaps there will be less pressure
for the making and selling of brandy,
and this could make more grapes avail-
able for fortified, and perhaps table,
wine. There has been a significant in-
crease in the quality of table wines made
from traditional fortified and other-
purpose varieties. Witness the success
of McWilliams Lexia, Houghtons Ver-
dell, Henschkes Frontignac, John
Brown’s Muscat, Reynella Dry Moselle,
the Kaiser-Stuhl blends, and so on.
And because of the anticipated EEC
entry we may even get some dried
fruits available before they become
dried.
In spite of all this, and because of
the very nature of the long, slow pro-
cess of vineyard expansion and wine-
maturing, there is going to be some-
thing of a shortage of some wines in the
future. By 1970, some special reds will
sell out as soon as they hit the market,
Others will be rationed, either by the
price or quota. This will also apply to
some top-quality regional whites,
especially those from the Hunter,
Standard lines will be freely available,
though the better ones will be more
sought-after. This may result in a rise
in price, or loss of quality as “stretch-
ing” occurs.
The industry can still do more in
research, both technical and marketing,
in promotion, in education. The grape-
growers should also help. As a highly
esteemed wine friend of mine put it,
“It’s about time some of them realised
their grapes are made into wine!
But whatever the future, one predic-
tion I know will come true. I will con-
tinue to enjoy wine, in all its shadings
and complexities, faults and virtues,
with my many friends and family
though I may take it less and less
seriously! I do hope that you continue
to enjoy it with me.

Before too long, Australia’s one and only Van
Gogh will be hanging in the new gallery of
the Victorian Arts Centre now being built in
Melbourne. You’ll enjoy going there it will
be a very pleasant place to look at pictures.
And Alcoa aluminium in a new kind of roof
wi ll help make it that way. It will play an
important part in the control of interior
temperatures—keeping things bright and
bny and cool.
designer of the Victorian Arts Centre has
taken advantage of the characteristics of
Alcoa aluminium particularly its superior
bhght finish in a patented process of sun
control. Bright Alcoa aluminium sheeting is
Pierced in a pattern of small slits, and the
s " eet expanded in such a way that the slits
form three-dimensional apertures. The expan-
ded sheet is vacuum-sealed between two
panels of acrylic, and the panels are formed
into a series of curved rooflights. This forms a
screen of tiny apertures which admit desirable
light, reflect intense beams of direct sunlight
and keep out rain. Very ingenious. And the
light which filters through the screen is evenly,
pleasingly diffused throughout the building.
Yes, Alcoa aluminium will help present Aus-
tralia’s only Van Gogh and all the art
treasures from the previous home of the
National Gallery of Victoria in the best
possible light.

RUDY
TOO RECENT an arrival to be
a reffo, too long here for a New
Australian, Rudy Komon in many
ways represents all the attitudes
which Europeans brought to Aus-
tralia and all the changes which
Australia has wrought in her
Europeans: a one-man cultural
revolution.
He came in 1950, a Viennese-
born sporting journalist of Czech
parentage, with a few bundles of
possessions and some European
prints. Soon Komon was selling
Australian paintings, and Austra-
lian painters, to Australians.
Today there is the handsome
and successful gallery at Padding-
ton; the high reputation as a wine
judge and food expert; the rich
Australian suntan, helped along
one would think, by a lamp j n
winter. Above all there is the
accent, helped along, one would
like to think, by a good vocal
coach; there are many imitators
of Rudy’s accent, but no one can
do it as well as Rudy.
Komon has done well here, but
sometimes his blue eyes seem to


slirve y it all with some irony. After
the customary glass of white wine
a t the gallery, he is busy putting
the corks back into the empty
bottles. “I always put the corks
hack into the bottles,” he said.
«\Vhy, Rudy?” asks a guest, eager
to pick up something new in wine-
jnanship. “Because,” says Rudy,
“it keeps out the flies.”

Mr. Zitnik figures
out the shape
of things to come
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
THERE’S THIS woman rummaging
in the cut-price corselettes for some-
thing to slenderise Mother, and there’s
Mr. Norman Zitnik in his office say-
ing it’s a wonder he’s still alive, the
speed he had to travel round Germany
to meet all the foundation manufac-
turers. He went at 120 miles an hour
thank God for the autobahns.
He looks the way the only male cor-
set buyer in the Southern Hemisphere
(claims David Jones) should not. Sort
of Cesar Romero-ish, hair-line mous-
tache and all, dressed overall in brown,
the new in-color for men, with toning
paisley tie and ’kerchief. And he’s
flicking cigarette ash into one of those
whirly ashtrays and pressing the button
every other second. And his office, just
off the ladies’ fitting-rooms, is very
small and cluttered with assistant Mrs.
Quigley’s potted plants (he hasn’t the
heart to ask her to move them) and lots
of Lo-Dare and Leggy-look corset
posters on the wall. “Some things are
too good to change says another one.
Nothing has changed in Mr. Zitnik’s
office since his round-the-world trip
hunting for new foundation ideas,
except that someone has whipped his
100-year-old corset from the cupboard.
He’d like to know who.
Mr. Zitnik is back. And everyone’s
dying to know what shape they’ll be in
next summer. Mr. Zitnik’s afraid
they’re in for a disappointment, dear,
there is nothing new. There hasn’t been
since the stretch-strap four years ago,
and the body-stocking that flopped.
How it flopped. Three million dollars
worth of flop to its American manu-
facturers. You can get ’em in New York
now for $3. Three dollars. They cost
$24 in Sydney. Oh, yes, they went.
But very slowly. Mr. Zitnik had dread-
ful trouble shifting his Cobras and
Leopard lines or was it Ocelot
and Vipers? he certainly didn t re-
order. Funny thing about New York,
the throbbing heart of the girdle-and-
bra business. He went there to learn,
really learn, but he knew it all. In fact,
they are pointing to Sydney as t e

j t ’ s too well intimate for New
is Mr. Zitnik’s third year as
nl’s buyer of girdles and bras. He
t this unique position via Temporary
L a s Staff in Men’s Wear, a spell
t Senior Executive Training, two
a rs in Pharmaceuticals, graduating
as manager, and then one day Mr.
McNeill, the Personnel Director, sent
for him and said, “Zitnik, what about
corsets?” For a moment he thought
Mr, McNeill was joking, he often
does, then he asked to see the figures.
These are terribly secret, but Mr.
Zitnik says play around with $1 million
or so a year, and it’s not far out.
(Actually, Australian women buy 2\
bras per year and 1.64 girdles. That,
sa ys Mr. Zitnik, is all females, includ-
ing babies, so double it for accuracy.)
Anyway, he took the job and the
department’s profits have zoomed by
(sssh) th*rty percent. His customers
look for something different. Well,
you know, imported. And in order
to keep up with their requirements he
has developed a fiendish filing system
that shows at once what is selling and
what is not. He stocktakes every fort-
night and once found 281 girdles of
different brands on his hands. Out
with those.
Mr. Zitnik has returned, then, with
his foundation findings. The news is
Color Co-ordination. That is, matching
bra, girdle, and slip. It might be hard
going in Sydney. Another of his sur-
veys revealed that ladies matched their
bras and slips but didn’t give a damn
what color their girdle was. However,
Mr. Zitnik lugs a cardboard box on
to his desk and pulls out bras and
things in various violent hues. Red
and gold brocade! Purple! Blue-silver!
Typical. He’d ordered gold. Ah, well.
There, isn’t that chic? Mauve lace
co-ordinators, each with its own little
gold key to retain or remove as you
wish. It’s the manufacturer’s gimmick.
This isn’t all. His other goodies have
yet to come, and they are terrific. For
example, he found some little bras in
Paris which are terribly expensive. They
might sell for about $l6. Hand-made.
After all, there are only two cups and
two side pieces, they must have some-
thing for their money. But now he
must be excused, he must get on with
his new, secret promotions.
There’s a man waiting for him by
Cut-Price Panties, Girdles, and Corsel-
ettes. City-suited. Balanced on furled
umbrella. “Hello, Uncle Norman,” he
cr ies. He is Mr. Doubt from Hickory,
on e of a dozen Doubts churning out
home-grown bras and girdles, and one
of the few local manufacturers Mr.
Zitnik buys from. Has he anything new?
Hr. Doubt looks left and right, low-
ers his voice, and says yes, he can now
break the news. They are hanging
garments and doing away with all those
ghastly boxes, but even more impor-
*-ant, they are bringing in a new
l-16thin. lining to the cotton bra.
It does away with wrinkles, or some-
thing.

Exposed
EXPO 67 has provided some interest-
ing evidences of Canada’s cultural
colonialism. The whole enterprise, in
part, was intended to show that Canada
was a country with a culture and mind
0 f its own, and not overwhelmed by
the United States.
However, the Montreal critics seemed
very willing to become one with the
United States when it came to estimat-
ing visitors’ performances. The Mon-
treal “Star” critic found Normie Rowe
a “frail imitation of North American
groups”; the “Gazette” music critic said
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra
was “not virtuoso by North American
standards.”
However, Howard Klein of the New
York “Times” took a different line.
“The Melbourne orchestra’s aims,” he
wrote, were “too high for Montreal’s
musical tastes” and “its refinement of
taste and Mozart style were lost on
most listeners.”
On the bench
DURING the Journalists’ Award hear-
ing before the Full Bench of the
Arbitration Commission last week, Mr.
R. O’Dea, for the AJA, was cross-
examining a witness for Mirror News-
papers Ltd. Mr. O’Dea had been dis-
cussing sensational posters and head-
lines in the Sydney afternoon news-
papers, and produced an edition of
the “Daily Mirror” of June 7. Almost
the whole front-page display was given
over to three words in poster type:
“ISRAELIS CRUSH ARABS.”
Mr. O’Dea: How do you measure
the headlines on the front page, is that
in points or do you refer to it in
inches? Witness: This particular type
is measured in inches. Mr. O’Dea:
What size poster would you have if
an atom bomb was dropped on Mel-
bourne?
Mr. Justice Moore (presiding):
Probably none at all.
Changing world
THE OLD IDEA of relations between
Latholics and Masons was roughly like
the current one between Arabs and
Jews. But next weekend, there will be
some solid evidence of a very different
sort of relationship between the Roman
Utholic Church and Masons, when
the top N.S.W. Mason goes to the
Va tican as an invited guest.
Sydney timber merchant Eric Prim-
rose, the Grand Master of the United
Grand Lodge of N.S.W., and R. H.
Burley, the Grand Secretary, are leaving
this week to attend the 250th anniver-
sary of the United Grand Lodge of
England and are stopping in Rome on
the way.
The Vatican visit, arranged by the
local hierarchy, is the first any Aus-
tralian Masonic leader has made there
officially (none has ever met the Pope),
and represents some massive changes
in attitudes.
But local Masons have been getting
on with local Catholics pretty well for
some time; lodge members have for
many years been doing a lot of charit-
able work for some of the Catholic
orders of nuns, like the Little Sisters of
the Poor; the sight of nuns serving
afternoon tea to sweating Masons
renovating their schools was a familiar
sight on Sydney’s upper North Shore
last summer.
Mr. Primrose and Mr. Burley will
also make an official visit to Dublin
before returning to Sydney in August,
in time for the annual Masonic church
service in which Anglican, Presbyterian,
and Methodist clergy will take part.
Answering the call
SWAMI VENKATASANANDA
(Swami Gee for short) is amazed by two
things in Australia. One is our commer-
cial attitude toward life, the other is that
we never look happy. “I have seen
only one happy face in Sydney,” Swami
Gee told us. The face belonged to
Cardinal Gilroy, with whom Swami Gee
spent a pleasant morning talking about
meditation.
The Swami, who has no home (“My
home is where I am at the moment,”
he says), wears very becoming saffron
robes, sometimes with a matching pull-
over when the weather is cold. He has
brown eyes, a happy smile, and no ten-
sions. Tension, he believes, is the curse
of Western society, and is what makes
us in Australia, look so unhappy. “You
Swami Gee and the centre of concen-
tration
must learn through yoga philosophy,
to relax, learn a certain detachment
from life,” he explained.
Twenty years ago, Swami Gee, who
is now 46, gave up his job with the
Indian Public Service and all his pos-
sessions, entered an ashram, or . place
of retreat, and became a swami after
five years’ study. Swami Gee is one of
only half a dozen swamis who spend
their lives travelling most swamis
stay in retreat and he goes wherever
he is called.
He was called here by Australian
entrepreneur of yoga Roma Blair, who
has arranged television and public
appearances for him all over Australia.
“Thousands of women learn yoga here,”
she explained. “I thought it would be
marvellous for them to meet someone
who practises the yoga way of life
completely.”
The Swami is sad that more Aus-
tralian men don’t practise yoga—par-
ticularly the mental side of it. “I do
only half an hour of physical exercises
a day,” he said. “Quite enough for any
healthy man.”
Swami Gee thinks that with so many
women learning detachment toward life
and so many men not learning it,
there must be some nasty domestic
situations where, as he puts it, “the
wife is tranquil and the husband is
mad.”
He is also rather horrified at our
lack of appreciation of the luxuries
which abound here television, cars,
swimming-pools, and dozens of dif-
ferent sorts of ice-cream. “I am not
here to raise the question of whether
you should have them or not,” he said,
“only to teach you how to enjoy' them.
All you do is acquire them, then reach
out for more.”
Nolan, looking back
FOUR EXHIBITIONS of paintings by
Sidney Nolan will be showing in Syd-
ney at the same time in September. A
retrospective will be at the Art Gal-
lery of N.S.W.; at Qantas there will be
more than 100 new theatre and ballet
designs; at David Jones, a group of
paintings from the Burke and Wills and
Antarctica series, together with some
landscapes; and at the Macquarie,
Shakespearian paintings.
The retrospective opening Septem-
ber 12 will contain 150 paintings, dat-
ing from 1937 to 1957, including some
from all Nolan’s major series Ned
Kelly, Leda and the Swan, Gallipoli,
African animals, and Antarctica. This
exhibition will later go to Melbourne
and Perth.
The Art Gallery of N.S.W. retro-
spective is something of a triumph for
the director, Hal * Missingham, who
bought the first two Nolan paintings for
the Gallery in 1947. These were
“Pretty Polly Mine” and “Cowan
Plains,” which he bought despite pro-
tests from the Trustees.
“They cost about 60 guineas each and
the Trustees didn’t like them at all,”
said Mr. Missingham. “1 had the right
to buy what I liked, but when I bought
stuff like Nolan’s they promptly took
the right away from me, then gave it
back a few months later. Then I’d
buy something else they didn’t like and
we’d start all over again.”
Mr. Missingham has designed a
special two-color poster for the retro-
spective with Ned Kelly as a theme.
Mr. Nolan is coming to Sydney next
month.

AS I SEE IT
Arab-Israeii war
might speed British
East-of-Suez exit
FROM ALAN REID
who is accompanying the Prime Minister
on his trip abroad
WHEN EGYPT and Israel last week
resorted to armed conflict to resolve
their differences, each side tried to make
it as awkward as they could for the
other. They also made it extremely
awkward for Australian Prime Minis-
ter Harold Holt.
Holt went overseas for several pur-
poses. But easily the most important
of them, in his eyes, was to persuade the
British to maintain a presence East
of Suez, at least to a greater extent
than he suspected the British intended.
Failing that, his purpose was to per-
suade the British, if they decided to
withdraw from South-East Asia, to
delay the announcement of their with-
drawal until the South Vietnamese, and
their American and Australian allies,
were in a better position there.
With these purposes in mind, Holt
kept emphasising, from the day he left
Australian territory, that it was in
South-East Asia, rather than in the
Middle East, that the future course of
world events would be decided; that
happenings in this area of the globe
would produce either peace or war.
Right until the last moment, when
the actual outbreak of hostilities
between Israel and Egypt proved his
judgment faulty, Holt kept insisting
that events in the Middle East were
merely “a flurry,” which would settle
down.
His theme was: Vietnam over-
shadows in importance what is hap-
pening in the Middle East. Even
though his analysis may now seem mis-
taken, he could still have a chance, in
an odd kind of way, of proving right
from the long-term viewpoint.
His advice was that, despite the
Middle East tension, none of the main
powers would directly confront each
other in this area.'
Until the Israeli-Egyptian hostilities
actually started, Holt was doing q u i te
well. President Johnson’s analysis of
danger-point priorities coincided
broadly with Holt’s. Holding SoutE
East Asia to be a graver danger point
than the Middle East, Johnson agreed
with Holt that British withdrawal f rora
the area would be, if not disastrous at
least a cause for grave concern. ’ h
would produce a power vacuum in the
Singapore-Malaya-Indonesia zone where
Britain has shouldered the responsibility
in the post-war period. It would leave
the United States in the politically
embarrassing situation of being the
only non-Asian major power operating
on the Asian mainland.
Holt was assured that Johnson’s and
the United States’ immense influence
would be exerted upon the British
Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and
the British Government, to produce the
situation that Holt wanted either
maintenance of a significant British
presence in the area or deferment of
an announcement of a program for
British withdrawal until the position
in South Vietnam and neighboring
South-East Asian countries became
more stabilised.
Johnson undoubtedly tried to get
Wilson to accept the United States and
Australian viewpoint that it was neces-
sary for Britain to retain a worth-while
presence in South-East Asia. But where
previously President Johnson and the
United States administration could have
brought forcible influence to bear once
the Middle East conflict broke out, the
American position was not as strong
as it had been.
The U.S. needed British support, and
help, to get the Middle East troubles
settled before they spread, since they
could involve the major powers the
U.S. and Russia in a dangerous
frontal clash, the outcome of which
would be anyone’s guess. So Johnson
had to handle Wilson with greater
delicacy.
If this reading of the British position
is correct, then the Middle East crisis
has provided Wilson with the excuse to
proceed to a decision that Britain must
withdraw from South-East Asia at a
period when neither the United States
nor Australia can complain or argue
too loudly.
If they did they would seem to be
breaking the solid front, of which
Britain is part, working for peace in
the Middle East.
Where Harold Holt thought he was
in a reasonably strong position to
press for the maintenance of a signifi-
cant British presence in South-East
Asia particularly after he had
obtained from Johnson an undertaking
that the U.S. would press for the same
thing he is now in an awkward
position; he is talking about the future
in South-East Asia, whereas, of neces-
sity, the concern must be about the
present situation in the Middle East.


AUSTRALIA
The old-new war caught them
hopping in Canberra
CANBERRA RATHER ENJOYED
the Middle East war. Over in the
Russell Hill defence buildings the old
hands were able to come into their
own again, asserting themselves over
the slick young guerilla boys of
Canungra-Malaya-Vietnam experience.
Those brought up on the desert battles
of World War II could demonstrate
their mastery of set-piece battle tac-
tics, and many of them were able to
indulge in name-dropping and get
away with endless reminiscences.
For the Intelligence people it was
really strange hours. The war was being
fought, most inconveniently, in the
night, Australian-time, so reports
come in thickest and fastest in the
early hours of the morning, and they
were scurrying into their offices each
morning at approximately 4.00 a.m.
Their job was to produce a ronoed
report on the situation by 9 or 10 a.m.
In the post-report relaxation they
were able to have some laughs at their
political masters. One morning it was
at Deputy Prime Minister McEwen,
who, it was announced, couldn’t make
it to a Canberra defence sub-committee
meeting because he had been kept at
his farm in Victoria, milking his cows.
Mr. Holt, in North America with his
statement about this “huffing and
puffing,” hadn’t been reading his
cables. “Too much sitting in those
talking chairs” commented one
irreverent official.
External Affairs admitted that it had
been caught a bit flat-footed, though
it pointed out that everyone else was,
too. (The Americans and British hardly
reacted to the crisis with smoothness.)
E.A. got most of their up-to-the-
minute news by listening to radio news-
casts just like other Australians; they
got word of the cease-fire demand by
the UN Security Council in a telephone
call from an Embassy man in Toronto
who was watching the news on TV. We
do have posts in Tel Aviv and Cairo,
hut more detailed information was com-
lng from Washington and London.
They admitted that our orientation
toward Asia had left us badly placed
to make any profound judgments about
what was occurring in the Middle East.
y e have some very good “Arabists”
ju our foreign service, though most have
been redeployed since the mid-’fifties
j*ud are not very up-to-date. “After Bob
Menzies had his go in ’56, we did get
a hit of a bloody nose, and so we tried
to forget the Middle East” said one
man.
In Canberra not much credence
was given to suggestions that there was
a danger of escalation into a U.S.-
Russian confrontation. There was never
any chance of the Russians becoming
involved, it was judged. They move
their warships into the Mediterranean
to enjoy the European summer every
year, so it was said.
Officials tried to impress their official
neutrality in the dispute (they ex-
pressed relief that none of our embassies
in the Arab countries have been done
over the way the American and
British have), but privately they seemed,
Lord Casey.. “journalistic colonialism”
like other Canberra citizens, to be
barracking for Israel. How could the
slouch-hatted soldiers of this tough little
David-country fail to engender an Aus-
tralian under-dog sympathy, when
faced by a clumsy ill-co-ordinated
Goliath?
The Israeli Embassy was inundated
with offers of support and messages
of sympathy. A member of the local
flying club said he and his mates
all Gentiles wanted to go over to
fly for Israel. Money came in steadily,
too, and the Ambassador-designate and
his staff of two were busy redirecting
it to the local citizens’ aid-Israel group.
Harsh words were reserved for the
UN and especially Secretary-General
U Thant. Some important people said
U Thant carried more personal respon-
sibility than any other person for the
war. They recounted things this way:
Nasser never asked for a complete
withdrawal of the UN emergency force,
only for its removal from front-
line positions. U Thant, without even
playing for time, said the troops would
have to stay exactly where they were
or be pulled out altogether. Nasser
was forced to suggest withdrawal, and
U Thant, without consulting his
masters in the Security Council,
removed the fire-brigade force, en-
couraging the arsonists.
Our Canberra man found the aca-
demics as strong Israel barrackers as
anyone else. Sir Allan Watt, former
head of External Affairs, took time off
from working on a book on the Viet-
nam-Geneva agreements to talk
excitedly about Middle East develop-
ments. He was hoping that the under-
standable exuberance of the Israelis
would not lead them to go beyond the
Suez Canal or inflict any further
humiliation on the Arabs.
“Go down and see how our cousins
in Empire Circuit are feeling about
things,” suggested an Israeli to our
Canberra man, who, bearing his
rather Yiddish-looking black beard,
apprehensively entered the UAR
Embassy to find that the only person
home (apart from two very Australian
stenographers) was just leaving. “It is
all very confusing, you know. I think
we are winning, although the Israelis
caught us by surprise. They got 200
of our planes on the ground, and they
caught us completely by surprise in
the desert. We are holding back our
strength. We do have, after all, the
biggest arsenal of rockets in the whole
of the Middle East. And we haven’t
fired a single one yet. I don’t know
why. It is all very confusing . . .” and
with that he stepped into his Volks-
wagen, leaving a deserted Embassy.
Governor-General
Speaking out
BARON RICHARD GARDINER
CASEY, the spritely 76-year-old occu-
pant of Government House in Can-
berra, is emerging as the most out-
spoken Governor-General ever to repre-
sent the British monarchy in Australia.
In his first week back from a visit
to Britain and the United States Lord
Casey gave two Press interviews in
which he openly aired his views on
current world affairs, a chore which
GGs usually leave to the politicians. He
was hardly off the plane when he was
telling Pressmen at Mascot Airport his
views on the possible British entry to


the European Economic Community.
Later, in an interview on the ABC’s
“This Day Tonight” program, he
expanded this to include the Middle
East war (he is a former British Minis-
ter for the Middle East), the British
Government’s East of Suez policy, the
future of Australian-British relations
and the economic situation in Aus-
tralia.
He also spoke about what on a pre-
vious occasion he christened Australia’s
“journalistic colonialism” taking
views, especially on world events, from
other countries. He said Australia must
develop its own view of world affairs,
particularly in Asia.
All this somewhat diminished the
well-established image of the GG as a
reticent, impartial party in the Aus-
tralian political scene, having the same
relationship with the Australian Gov-
ernment as the Queen does with the
British Government.
But Lord Casey was obviously moved
to speak out by his deep concern over
actions of the British Government. He
admitted that the prospect of a British
entry into the Common Market had him
in a dilemma caught between his
high regard for Britain and his love for
Australia.
But any public statements by a GG
must be kept within bounds, or rather,
out of bounds of the political arena.
In his television interview Lord Casey
stopped just short of openly propound-
ing Government Policy which, con-
sidering he is a former Liberal Minis-
ter and president of the Liberal Party,
would naturally be easy for him to slip
into.
Asked if the problems of the Com-
mon Market and the withdrawal of
British troops east of Suez could lead
to eventual Australian independence
from Britain, the GG said “it must
come down to that in the end.
“If our trade is cut down and we
are denied the support of British
forces,” he said, “then I am afraid there
is an amount of truth in it.”
Lord Casey stressed that to ensure
economic growth Australia needed
strong friends, almost a straight lift
from the Government’s policy of keep-
ing a British and American presence
in South-East Asia. But the withdrawal
of British troops from the area was
another factor “militating against our
close relations with Britain.”
On the Common Market question,
Lord Casey said that nobody could
deny Britain the right to take any steps
she believed were in her own best in-
terests. But he inferred there was more
to his visit to Britain than met the eye.
Holt and McEwen, he said, had been
concerned that the conditions of a
British entry into the Common Market
did not play havoc with Australia’s
trade with Britain. “I thumped this
into everybody who would listen to
me,” he said.
Sir William Yeo
The RSL
Involvement
USUALLY IT IS NOT N.S.W. that
gets national publicity for actions that
are considered illiberal, but last week
other States were able to jump on the
senior State because of Sir William
Yeo, head of the N.S.W. branch of the
RSL.
Sir William made trenchant state-
ments to the Press and on television
in defence of the State RSL’s disciplin-
ing of two members, Messrs. Wadding-
ton and Pascoe, “for their action in
promoting the Ex-Services Human
Rights Association of Australia, of
which the policies are directly opposed
to the basic policies of the League . . .
confirmed by resolutions of both State
and National Congress regarding Aus-
tralia’s involvement in the war in
Vietnam and National Service.”
To be sure the matter was well
understood, Anzac House in Sydney re-
leased a circular which quoted a daily
newspaper report of answers Mr. Wad-
dington was said to have given to
questions about his proposed association
. . . that it did believe in N.S., but not
involving service overseas, that it ob-
jected to the Tribunal which heard
the pleas of Conscientious Objectors,
and that it favored some form of
alternative service for them, but of a
non-military character. The association
would not deny membership because
of political beliefs, and would not debar
a Communist from joining.
The RSL State Council asked Mr.
Waddington’s sub-branch to investigate
and report back. The report indicated
nothing else more damning than that
membership of Mr. Waddington’s
association was open to ex-service
people of any nationality, including
those who served in foreign forces, with
associate membership open to non-
exservice people.
State Council “considered suffici
grounds existed for a Board of
to be set up” to see whether the mem
bership “of the two gentlemen j!
question” should be continued. (Tt,
other, Mr. Ashley Pascoe, had, i n 6
letter to the State Secretary,
William Yeo, “embarked on a length
diatribe against the Commonwealtl
and American action in Vietnam.”)
The Board of Inquiry, chaired by a
lawyer, gave the two members “ample
opportunity to state their cases.” The
Board recommended to State Council
that Mr. Waddington be expelled and
Mr. Pascoe be suspended for five years
The Anzac House justification was
that the League’s policies had been
adopted by democratic vote at State
and Federal Congresses, that its right
to expel members opposed to League
objects and policies had been upheld
by the courts in several cases.
Finally, said Anzac House, “whilst
every member has the right to disagree
and express his opposition in his sub-
branch, it is surely consistent with
democratic principle that if a member
cannot reconcile such opposition with
continued membership of the League
he should resign and not use his RSL
membership to divide members and
capitalise on the situation by attracting
members to an organisation set up to
promote such opposition.”
This interpretation of “democratic
principle” was taken up last week,
rightly or wrongly, by many Labor
Party members of the RSL, including
Mr. T. Uren, MHR, who said in a
letter to a Melbourne newspaper that
he was against Vietnam involvement,
but had no intention of resigning from
the RSL. Labor Senator Justin O’Byrne
sent a protest to the RSL national
president, Sir Arthur Lee, who promised
an investigation of the N.S.W. decision.
“RSL Intolerance” headed a “West
Australian” editorial which said, in
part, “It is hypocritical. to condemn
intolerance on Anzac Day and practice
it in suport of League policy, however
sincere the League may be in holding
its policy.” And to show that it had
not misunderstood the issues, added “By
expelling one member and suspending
another because they belong to an
association that is held to be anti-
Vietnam, the N.S.W. branch has denied
a democratic principle for which Aus-
tralians are sacrificing their lives in
Asia. If the Communists conceded
freedom to dissent it might be possible
to restore peace in Vietnam.”
\ln answer both to Sir William Vo
and Mr. Uren, the Victorian branch
of the RSL said it would not expel an)
member who opposed conscription of
the Vietnam commitment, and did not
take the view that any member who
did should leave the RSL.
The long-concealed tensions within
the RSL between its old-timers an
those who are trying to give it a new
role came a little more into the open
although not yet on the issues that
might yet finally cause public debate on
the future of one of Australia’s most
distinctive institutions.


Electric power
Coal, oil, water?
Rapidly expanding industry, in all
States, is a hungry user of power; and
hat brings its own problems of how
much how soon and with what fuel.
This calls for some inspired guessing
bv the power authorities, as in evi-
dence now in Tasmania and Western
Australia.
So far, the West Australian Gov-
ernment seems to have painted itself
j nto a corner in its dealings with
coalminers at Collie. Fighting for their
survival, the miners have won support
for what is not a particularly strong
caS e because of unnecessary Govern-
ment secrecy over the issue of com-
petition between oil and coal for power
production.
It seemed Collie had a reprieve when
the State biggest customer of the
town through the railways and State
Electricity Commission began build-
ing a $35 million power plant at Muja,
Collie’s open-cut. The contract was for
open-cut as well as deep-mine coal in
a compromise arrangement.
In a State doubling its power re-
quirements every six years, another
plant was commissioned at Kwinana,
using oil from BP’s refinery. This plant
was originally to have been only slightly
bigger than Muja but the fact drifted
out without formal announcement that
the oil-fueled plant would be twice as
big, 480-m.
The Collie miners, now with con-
siderable public backing, demand to
know the reasons; the Government
refuses to give them, claiming it would
be unfair to BP, as sole supplier, to
announce the price. Yet the price paid
to the companies selling coal is made
public.
The miners maintain that $7.12
worth of open-cut or $9.95 worth of
mixed open-cut and deep-mine coal
has the heating capacity of one ton
of fuel oil. And if all the Government
statements have been true, then the
price to BP for one ton of fuel oil
falls within this range. Yet other oil
consumers are being asked to pay
132.95 a ton.
In contrast, Tasmania’s Hydro
Electric Commission hardly mentioned
fhe island’s Fingal Valley coal deposits
in its latest plan—for a thermal power
station near Bell Bay—but concentrated
® a detailed explanation (which read
hhe an apologia for a strategic with-
drawal) of why thermal power was
needed in Tasmania.
The target date, mid-1970, sug-
gests that the HEC has been caught
' v 'th its amps down. Power demand
J' 0m expanding industry will more
than double by 1975 the target date
0r completion of Tasmania’s next and
Possibly last hydro-electric power com-
J. lex at Gordon River. In the mean-
,lrne) “a new source of power must be
m service in 1971.”
New Guinea
Double standard
Territories Minister Barnes
Australians are more and more be-
traying the characteristic double
standard of a colonial power whose
own political system is democratic.
There is pleasure when the New
Guineans show an interest in politics.
But when they want to do something
we don’t want them to do we get
resentful about it. Then Territories
Minister Barnes has to smooth it over.
Last week produced two splendid
examples. The Administration-domi-
nated select committee on constitutional
development for New Guinea presented
its recommendations to the House of
Assembly. They are very conservative,
leaving control firmly in the hands of
the Administrator and, through him,
Canberra. Simultaneously, our repre-
sentatives at the United Nations told
the Trusteeship Council that we were
pushing ahead with political develop-
ment at the greatest possible speed.
Yet, when the Committee of Thirteen,
a group of local officers and educated
Papuans, put forward a plan for devel-
opment toward responsible government
earlier this year, it was treated as
immoderate, unreasonable.
Later, Mr. lan Downs, a conservative
planter Member of the House of
Assembly, took up the matter of the
mass demonstration in Port Moresby
against the recent wage decision by
the Public Service Arbitrator. Mr.
Downs, an Australian who savors
responsible government, could not
recognise the same groping toward free-
dom in other people. The 2000-strong
demonstration, he said, had been
organised by the ACTU’s industrial
advocate, Mr. R. J. Hawke. In a classic
example of illogic, he argued that Mr.
Hawke had predicted protests which
eventuated. Therefore, he had organised
them.
The total wage
Mini-comment
A DAILY NEWSPAPER in Melbourne
once tried to find someone on the basic
wage but couldn’t. Department of
Labor officials said off-the-record that
they thought there would be several
hundred, possibly a thousand. It was
once, long ago, a minimum wage; but
over the years there have developed
such a proliferation of margins for the
skills needed or the difficulties involved
in any job, that it became an abstrac-
tion.
Last year the Arbitration Commission
recognised the fact of what had hap-
pened by establishing a minimum wage
substantially above the old basic
wage. And this year it abolished the
basic wage altogether, declaring that in
future it will operate on the “total
wage,” the minimum wage plus margins.
Reaction to the judgment was con-
fused. The unions condemned the in-
troduction of the total wage, probably
just because they had opposed it in
their submissions. Opposition Leader
Whitlam jumped in to echo unionist
protests, more with the coming State
conferences of the Labor Party in mind
than any broader public audience. He
was “bewildered.”
The most remarkable thing about
the whole judgment was its shortness
just ten and a bit foolscap pages.
Last year’s, by contrast, was four sub-
stantial books bound in bright green
covers and totalling 207 pages. In
Canberra the general comment was that
the Commission was replacing con-
fusion with evasion. In the past the
Commission paid employers, employees,
and the Commonwealth the respect of
commenting at some length on the
submissions they had made over the
weeks of the hearing.
Their excursions into economics were
often confused and contradictory, but
at least it was apparent what members
of the Bench had been thinking about.
Last year extroversion reached its high
point with each of the four judges
writing his own report, and there were
plenty of digs at fellow judges.
This year the Commission really
pulled its head in. The judgment was
called a “pronouncement” and that was
about all it amounted to. Admitting
disagreement on many of the subjects
put to the Commission, the president,
Sir Richard Kirby, nevertheless had got
the agreement of his fellow Commis-
sioners to state what had been common
ground. The more interesting disagree-
ments remain unknown.
After a cursory discussion of the state
of the economy, the pronouncement
came: “We have decided to award $1
increase to all adult employees.”
Their one bit of explanation was the
statement that they had considered “the
question of adjustment for price move-
ments (which we all think has a par-


Sir Richard Kirby
ticular significance in wage fixation),
the question of productivity movements,
and above all the question of economic
capacity to pay.” How these various
things had been considered, what weight
given to each, was left unstated.
The Commonwealth in its best-
argued, most persuasive submission
yet, had dealt at length with the prin-
ciples of national wage-fixing, arguing
that price adjustment was self-defeating,
and so should have no “particular sig-
nificance.” It got no explanation of
the reasons why the Commission
thought differentiy. The Government
had also argued that capacity-to-pay
could only be measured by productivity
movement, yet the Commissioners
appear to regard the two as being
separate issues.
The other parties employers and
unions whose representatives had spent
many days speaking to the Commission
fared no better. The Commission
did not commit itself to any comment
whatever.
Government Ministers made some
notable comments. Labor Minister
Bury spoke of the “very clarity of the
decision,” a sarcastic reference, no
doubt, to the lack of explanation.
Treasurer McMahon praised the Com-
mission for recognising “the vital im-
portance” of preserving general price
stability and said no widespread in-
creases in prices were justified by the
outcome. Which leaves him wide open
to charges of inconsistency, because
the Commonwealth had argued in its
submission that former increases in
wage costs had not yet been absorbed,
that no further increase was justified,
that any further increase was bound
to push up prices.
The $1 addition to wages means that
together with the last basic wage rise
and the margins award in January,
there has been a 9.5 percent increase
in wages in 15 months. That takes
some absorbing.
Fishing industry
Breaking point
AN ADVERTISEMENT in Australian
newspapers recently was a small pointer
to the advancement of the local fishing
industry into the technological age. The
Fisheries Branch of the Department of
Primary Industry sought a Fisheries
Education Adviser with a university
degree, experience in adult education,
and preferably a knowledge of fisheries,
salary $5-6000.
The background is that while in
Japan, Russia, and Norway there are
courses at technical college and even
university level to equip young men
for a fishing industry which uses
science, technology, and engineering to
a marked degree, in Australia there is
not one training course in fishing,
although it employs more than 10,000
people, twice as many as the much-
discussed chemical industry, for in-
stance.
Most Australian fishermen, whether
working within the new 12-mile limit
or beyond, depend on father-to-son
skills, a line being extended to break-
ing point by the challenges of new
techniques and equipment other nations
are using (freezing and packaging, for
instance) and only some of which are
under consideration here.
The Department of Primary Industry
is encouraging Australia’s professional
fishermen to form state-wide associ-
ations, with a national body in view.
(In Victoria one has just been formed,
with 100 members from four ports so
far, but 500 members as its aim. And
in N.S.W. the benefits of coastal
regional associations with shore-based
processing plants are being realised.)
With such groupings the education
adviser will be able to plan courses,
with text and audio-visual aids, to
help fishermen begin to catch up, up
their catch, and modernise their out-
look.
If the ruggedly individualistic in-
dustry, with its quota of foreign-speak-
Plan for Auckland’s international airport
ing members, welcomes the help it could
progress quickly. If not it could die as
rapidly under the pressures from new
well-equipped (with ships and tech!
nology) Australian-based overseas com-
panies that contemporary Australian
story.
Recently the Victorian Employed
Federation placed the local scene i n
perspective when it compared Austra-
lia’s fish production (79,000 metric
tons) with that of Chad, an inland
nation in Africa (100,000 metric tons)
Australia is 49th in the world’s fishing
nations on that catch. At the same time
a survey ketch owned by Geosurveys of
Australia returned with news that its
echo sounders had located huge shoals
of fish in deep water between Tas-
mania and Spencer’s Gulf.
“It’s time for Australia to start a
fishing fleet using mother ships, and
not continue with the present small-
time fishing,” said the company’s man-
aging director, Mr. Sprigg. “Australia
has a tremendous fishing potential right
at its back door.”
Pacific tourism
Auckland's airport
“WE HAVE TO HAVE something
worthwhile, so we can thumb our noses
at Sydney,” said New Zealand’s Minis-
ter of Civil Aviation, Mr. Gordon, in
Auckland last week when showing
sketch plans, a design report, and scale
model of a new terminal and facilities
for Auckland’s planned £N.Z.8.75 mil-
lion international airport.
Though Auckland airport is capable
of handling the biggest of today’s jets
the development is aimed for the new
era of “jumbos” and supersonic air-
craft. The proposed terminal structure
is like a divided figure 8. Sprouting
from a three-storey centre building are
separate wings connecting with
“fingers” for domestic and international

positions also for bigger aircraft; the
domestic area could handle four jets
and eight prop-jet aircraft.
The buildings have an area of 463,000
square feet, which is eight times larger
than the present terminal, and there
ill be 2J million square feet of hard
standing. This new look would serve
the airport for the next ten years,
but the design would allow it to be
enlarged another two and a half times,
s 0 it would last well into the next
century.
The assessed cost of buildings, electri-
cal and mechanical services, air-condit-
ioning, luggage conveyers, and other
facilities is put at £N.Z.4.75 million.
The figure for civil engineering works,
pavements, roads, and other amenities
is £N.Z.3.5 million. Another
£N.Z.500,000 has been allowed for
special contingencies. A million for
the air-conditioning startled Mr. Gor-
don.
However, he pointed out that,
although N.Z.’s economy was shaky, the
£N.Z.8.75 million Auckland internat-
ional airport was an investment for the
future, not only in vastly increased
tourist traffic but also in significantly
more air freighting. He was concerned
that international carriers might bypass
Auckland if its facilities did not meet
their needs. Working drawings are
expected in 1969 and completion esti-
mates vary from 1972 to 1982.
Pan American has said it will be
doubling its jet services to Auckland
from three to six a week as soon as
possible. And by 1970 Pan Am plans
eighteen flights into the South Pacific,
including a scheduled service by the
Boeing 747 with a maximum capacity of
five hundred passengers.
Much will depend on the speed of
these developments. Priority will be
given to the tarmac and hard-standing
areas because these would enable air
carriers to get the aircraft and passen-
gers into Auckland even if some tem-
porary arrangements have to be made
to handle them before the terminal
building is completed. New Zealand
doesn’t plan to miss any tourist money
if it can avoid that.
Sport
Busby's way
IN THE TOUGH, highly competitive
world of English Soccer only very
successful managers can survive. With
92 League clubs in four divisions striv-
ing for victory on the field and fin-
ancial bliss in the boardrooms, fatalities
are high. Since 1945 almost 600 English
Soccer managers have received the
terse “no longer required” notices. It
ls _ in this atmosphere that a pleasant,
ginger-haired Scot now in his 50s is
acknowledged Britain’s most successful
Soccer manager. He is Matt Busby, boss
of the great Manchester United now
touring Australia.
Busby, himself a former Scottish in-
ternational star, has not only managed
to stay with the one club for a record
22 years but has kept it at the top for
most of this time. Manchester United
have, since the war, . won the English
Football Association Cup twice and
the English League Championship five
times the last in the season just
ended. At the same time they achieved
considerable successes in various Euro-
pean competitions and have been rated
alongside such great teams as Spain’s
Real Madrid, Portugal’s Benfica, and
Italy’s Internazionale Milan.
Busby is in charge of players whose
total worth can only be estimated.
“Actually, they are priceless,” he
said in Sydney this week. “Players
like Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, George
Best, and some others are simply un-
Matt Busby of Manchester United
obtainable in Britain, so it’s futile
for me to say that they are worth
$300,000 or $500,000.”
Bobby Charlton, England’s World
Cup hero last year, is particularly close
to Busby’s heart: they were among the
very few survivors of the crash at
Munich airport in February, 1958,
that almost obliterated a great club.
Charlton escaped with minor injuries
but Busby spent months in hospital.
“Charlton was then a teenager with
a lot of promise,” said Busby, “and
after that tragedy, was almost forced
to mature rapidly. Within a year he
became the pivot around whom I could
start rebuilding my team.”
Busby’s incalculable contribution to
the successes of Manchester United have
been duly recognised by the club direc-
tors: only two years ago they took the
unprecedented step of making him a
shareholder in this multi-million enter-
prise, thus wiping the traditional gulf

that in professional Soccer separates
wealthy club directors from “hired
staff.” His salary is never revealed
though insiders estimate his earning
to be about $25,000 a year mo^e
than any of his star players makes.
He is one of those fortunate execu-
tives who can enforce discipline and
command full respect without resort-
ing to para-military means. Polished'
urbane, and possessing a ready wit’
Busby seldom raises his voice. ’
“The players, all highly paid p ro .
fessionals, are not children who have
to be disciplined. I never attempted
to curb their spirit or mould their
personalities into some uniformity. I
couldn’t, even if I tried. We have
Englishmen, Scots, and Irishmen in
the team, nine of them full international
stars for their country, and all have
vastly different temperaments and re-
actions. Even on the playing field I
allow my players more latitude than
most other managers and encourage
them to improvise. After all, they have
the skill and ability for that, they may
as well use it.”
Busby has his own philosophy about
the game’s future. “A couple of years
ago I was really worried, as Soccer
was fast becoming a defensive battle,”
he said. “In important matches like
Cup ties teams tried to score a quick
goal and then retreat into a packed
defence to hang on to their lead. This
trend was born in Italy and looked
like spreading through the world. The
danger was that spectators were getting
awfully bored with this sort of Soccer
and were staying away in hordes. But
the game has changed again. Teams
are finding ways to combat this defen-
sive mania and Soccer is again adven-
turous.
“I think the game is becoming more
like basketball, where all five players
must be able to attack and defend
with equal skill. This type of game
demands absolute physical fitness,
stamina, and speed. But, above all, it
requires skill. All my players must
have great individual skill, that’s the
basis for everything. I can improve
their staying power, even their speed
but if a player at 20 lacks technical
attributes, he’ll never make it.”
The present Australian tour is re-
garded by Busby as much more than
a post-season holiday for the players.
Their matches in the U.S.A., New Zea-
land, and Australia serve to prepare
United for the coming 1967-68 season,
when, as English champions, they will
once again take part in the prestigious
European Cup.
“When we return home, the players
will get a few weeks’ complete holiday,
he said. “That’s enough; I don’t believe
in long breaks. A fit and fully trained
sportsman not only copes with but
actually needs almost constant train-
ing. This has been proved by athletes,
swimmers, and others. To stay at the
top is much harder in sport than getting
there.”


COMMENT
Russia may yet be the victor
in the Middle East
AUSTRALIANS SUDDENLY FELT at home
again with the desert warfare of the Israeli blitz-
krieg against the Arabs. Swift, decisive blows. Move-
ment you could mark on the map. And “our side”
apparently winning. It was what we were brought
up on. The seeming simplicities of the campaign
were a relief from the unfamiliarities and perplexities
of the struggle in Vietnam. Yet it is in Vietnam, in
Indonesia, and in similarly confused situations that
Australia’s particular preoccupations will continue
to lie.
The criticisms of Mr. Holt, Mr. Hasluck, and Mr.
Fairhall for being out of the country at the time
when the crisis blew up were a fatuous example of
conventional thinking. What on earth could they do
about it by being back in Canberra? It was a regional
crisis and, like other regional crises in a world in which
the contestants seek support from the divided super
powers, it was potentially a world crisis. But as a
world crisis there was nothing we could do about it,
and as a regional crisis it was out of our region.
We must understand that the Middle East, however
important it may have seemed in the past, is now to
us just a region like any other. It used to appear to
be of critical interest to the British because it was
to them the gateway to India. That hasn’t got much
to do with us now. Our trade with Japan, America,
and China is not affected by what happens to the
Suez Canal; it doesn’t matter much if three days are
added to a voyage by a diversion around the Cape
of Good Hope; and airlines flying to Europe and
London can divert their routes in a couple of hours.
To say this is not to say that it does not concern
us what happens in the area but simply that it is no
longer of the special concern that it was when the
Suez Canal seemed one of the pivots of British power.
We can still admire the courage and dash with which
the Israelis are ready to defend their nation’s right to
existence. They were stung by the terrorist tactics of
the Syrians and Nasser’s provocative bluffs, and while
there was a case for urging them to a little more
patience it was quite understandable that, surrounded
by hostile nations publicly committed to their
annihilation, they defended themselves by swift, pre-
emptive action.
The Israelis naturally concern themselves with
their own affairs. It would be wrong, however, to
assume that the Russians are going to suffer a dis-
astrous defeat in the Middle East. In the disorder
that now follows they may gain rather than lose.
The Arabs are now suffering one of their greatest
humiliations and humiliated Arabs do not make
good friends. As they turn on each other, their des-
peration may force them to the kind of extremisms
that both Nasser and Hussein were, in their own
ways, trying to ride.
In this sad situation the Russians can still stand
forth as the opponents of Israeli territorial claims.
The situation may revert to the one that Nasser had
fabricated, and in which Arabs feel at home a
continuing propaganda argy-bargy of threat and
counter-threat, bluff and counter-bluff.
Although quite falsely, the Arab States see America
as the instigator of the Israeli actions and, as a result
of his speech-making, they see Mr. Harold Wilson as
America’s chief accomplice. It is to Britain’s dis-
advantage that they also see de Gaulle as a neutral,
and it will be to de Gaulle’s advantage in fighting the
entry of Britain into the Common Market that he
can instance Mr. Wilson’s “initiative” in the Middle
East as yet another example of Britain’s desire to
play an independent and un-European role.
There are, of course, even among the Arabs, and
especially in Cairo, those who are getting fed up with
the histrionics of propaganda diplomacy, as the In-
donesians got fed up with Sukarno and the
Ghanians with Nkrumah. If the present situation
unexpectedly strengthens the moderates, this will
represent a victory for pragmatism and common-
sense.




WHY THE WAR HAPPENED
IT READ like the beginning of so many
other wars. The armaments pile up.
The mistakes are made. Then, like a
string of fireworks setting themselves
off, one thing leads to another.
In sorting it out, you could begin
anywhere. A possible beginning to the
present sequence was the American
decision to cut off Egypt’s wheat, taken
six months ago in what proved to be
an act of useless blackmail. It was
intended to moderate Nasser’s policies
in the Yemen, but it resulted only in
leaving him with nothing to lose from
the Americans. In the same way, can-
cellation of American aid to the Aswan
Dam project in 1956 had left him free
for the Suez adventure. And as the
Russians took over from the Americans
at Aswan, so the Russians this time
filled Nasser’s emptying granaries; by
a fluke the Americans had stopped
sending wheat at one of those rare times
when the Russians had wheat to spare.
A more immediate and obvious
beginning was the stepping up of the
dynamiting. Set up three years ago, the
Syrian-trained terrorist “Palestine
Liberation Organisation” had already
broken the peace by blowing up instal-
lations inside the Israeli border on more
than 100 sabotage raids, but it went into
business more seriously this year when
the desperate men of Syria’s coup-
threatened Government increased their
stakes. Fighting for continued power
in a country that has seen 14 coups in
18 years, they finally provoked the
Israelis to a full border battle in April
with tanks, mortars, and artillery, in
which the Israelis shot down seven
Syrian MIG fighters.
For a month more, the Israelis con-
tinued to suffer Syrian guerilla
attacks; then on May 16 the sequences
began to come together. The provoked
Israelis deployed 14 brigades in offen-
sive formation a few miles from Syria’s
border and took up defensive positions
against the Egyptian frontier. Liberated
of all concern for American reaction
alarmed that the Israelis might be
•planning a knock-out blow similar to
their thrust in Sinai in 1956, and deter-
mined to regain his lost initiative
among the Arabs, Nasser took only two
days to take over from Syria by lining
up his own troops opposite the UN
border troops and telling them to get
out. Expecting a long, satisfying propa-
ganda war that would divert the crisis,
Nasser was astounded when U Thant
at once gave in and ordered the UN
troops to withdraw. Nasser’s next step
was even bolder: the blockade of the
Gulf of Aqaba, and further deployment
of Egyptian troops. Next step: Israel’s
mobilisation. Next step: War.
To understand Nasser’s action it is
not enough to regard him simply as a
maniac craving excitement or as a
cynic deflecting discontent at home on
t 0 enemies abroad. In some ways he
was a moderate among the wild men
of Araby. While his Radio Cairo
oratory was all bombast, his private
style was usually much more prudent
and cautious. For instance, he had often
said that the Arabs could not success-
[nllv fight Israel for another 20 years
and, until circumstances threw him
tack into it, he had become scared of
the terrorists who ran the Palestine
liberation Organisation; wanting some-
thing that sounded fearful but wasn’t,
when the real terrorists took over, he
withdrew much of his support. Even

An Israeli tank moves into the Jordan sector of Jerusalem
The Israelis 1 flag of victory
of Aqaba were not without some legal
basis—lsrael had not occupied the port
of Eilat by agreement, and its use of
the narrow Straits of Tiran at the
entrance to the Gulf was not guaran-
teed by any protocol, nor could these
straits be described without doubt as
international waters. It would be more
accurate to see Nasser as a bluff artist
who suddenly and uncharacteristically
called his own bluff.
It should also be remembered that
while in the West the right, of Israel
to exist was no longer questioned, in the
Arab States Israel was still seen as an
intruder; the long-unsettled question
of the Palestine refugees was a con-
stantly inflammable issue; and Israel’s
neighbors were afraid that the Israelis
would seize some of their territory. It
would be wrong to see Nasser as purely
cynical when he declared that the
struggle against Israel was a “Holy
War.” He undoubtedly saw the foun-
dation of Israel as an act of Western
colonialism, in which the Western
nations agreed to European intruders
seizing Arab land and displacing the
natives. His deep distrust of America
came from the fact that he saw America
as the principal supporter of what he
regarded as an act of conquest. He saw
the British, whom he regarded as the
former oppressors of his country, as
the Americans’ main collaborators. And
what’s more they tried to clobber him
in 1956 and he suspected that they
would still like to settle the score.
These views of Nasser’s were not his
alone. They explain why some ex-
colonial countries outside the Muslim
nations supported his action. India, for
example. To the West, Nasser was all
villain. To some other countries he was
part hero, if a little faded around the
edges.
Nasser’s political problem was, how-
ever, more than the results of playing
the role of the proud Arab who makes
hot speeches against the colonialists.
He also sought glory for his nation,
which he saw as the natural leader of
the Arab world. It was this desire for
prestige that provided one of the main
impulses to the present disaster. Even
here it is worth remembering that
because Nasser wanted glory “for his
nation is not a reason for treating him
as a kind of exceptionally childish
shyster. Not only, as Sukarno found,
can national glory be some kind of
consolation for economic failure; it has
also been one of the main promptings
of European politics, and the cause of
so many of Europe’s barbarisms. Fallen
pride is still one of Britain’s greatest
problems, and with de Gaulle national
renown (along with protection of the
subsidised and inefficient French dairy
farmers) is one of the principal thrusts
for foreign policy.
With the renown of his nation
dependent on its leadership of the
Arabs (weakened ever since Syria broke
free of the United Arab Republic
alliance) Nasser, without wanting to,,
bluff by bluff, steered toward the calam-
ities of war. He might have been con-
tent to assert leadership of the Arabs
merely by hanging Jews and imperial-
ists in effigy in the streets of Cairo for
the rest of his days, but by the begin-
ning of this year the greater intran-
sigence of Syria was threatening what
was left of his leadership of “the
Arab revolution.” That is why he
risked the peace of the Middle East
(or, as the Indians are now beginning
to call it, “West Asia”) and the peace
of the world. Although the Arabs all
detested Israel they were not united
against it. They used their anti-Israel
propaganda as a way of contesting with,
each other for power in the Arab world
and in this context Nasser wanted to
be the most anti-Israeli of them all.
The desperadoes of Syria were now
ahead of Egypt, with a more zealously
revolutionary rhetoric than Nasser’s and
a genuinely terrorist program.
When Syrian adventurism provoked
Israeli counter-action, Nasser had to
stand by Syria’s side, or accept second
place to it in the hierarchy of the Arab
nationalist revolutionaries. His caution
may have prompted him against the
move, but his pride pushed him on. So,,
although wanting to control the Syrians
and deter the Israelis, he took steps
that succeeded only in inflaming them
both and he did not give himself time
to deal with the problem in the way he
had settled it in the past by plotting
another coup in Syria to get himself a
Syrian Government he could deal with-
To outdo the Syrians, to impress the
Israelis, and to recover a lost renown,
his remedy was his familiar mixture of
outward belligerence and private cal-
culation. When he put up his demand
for the withdrawal of the UN troops,
he hoped for a complicated barney
that would go on for months, in which
he could display his own zeal at the
centre of the stage while preventing a
clash between Syria and Israel. Since
he knew that withdrawal of the UN
troops would leave Egypt open to
Syrian guerillas and the Israeli Army
he was more alarmed than delighted
when U Thant gave in. U Thant did
not understand that Arabs prefer long,
loud public arguments to quick, busi-
nesslike decisions.
To keep the initiative Nasser had to
do something else. It was here that
his private caution deserted him. His
quick follow-up with a declaration of


the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba
kept him in the propaganda lead, but
it put Israel into the very mood he
had feared: of seeing no alternative
except to strike back in a pre-emptive
blitzkrieg. Even here, although his
words were full of fireworks, it is
doubtful if the blockade had begun to
exist. His PR Department invented
pseudo-events minefields that were
not there, searches of ships that did
not take place but, consumed by
the need to keep face, he escalated his
oratory to a demand for the annihila-
tion of Israel. Even so, while the loud-
speakers blared martial music and hate
sessions in Cairo and the “We Want
War” “spontaneous” demonstrators
were organised in Government trucks,
Nasser nevertheless kept riot troops
hidden in a back street in case the
demonstrators got out of hand and
attacked the U.S. Embassy. By now he
may have been dismayed that the
phony war he had cooked up was
about to go on the boil. It was nice
that his enemy Hussein of Jordan,
a former British client, was now allied
to him and that he had re-established
his leadership of the Arabs, but where
was he leading them to?
Nasser was riding the tiger, and the
tiger now took its own path. The
younger generation of Egyptians had all
been indoctrinated with nationalist zeal
and Arab chauvinism was growing more
virulent with the years, not less. Among
these enthusiasts Nasser had been more
moderate than most, but to control
them, and to maintain his power over
them, he put on a masquerade of
strength. Winning a trick might restore
self-regard and restore some balance of
moderation. But in calling the world’s
bluff on Aqaba he forced the Israelis
to show their hand.
In Israel the Government was not
concerned with war. It was a Govern-
ment not of hawks but of doves, put
together to handle Israel’s economic
recession. Levi Eshkol had been Minis-
ter for Finance for 12 years before he
replaced David Ben-Gurion in 1964 as
Prime Minister and he was proud of
being a moderate consensus man. But
as the. Syrian guerilla attacks grew,
the pressure also grew from the Israeli
hawks. There were those who believed
that Israel should sweat it out, relying
on the support of the Maritime Powers
and its friends in Africa and Asia. And
there were the blitzkriegers with a motto
of “Strike first and argue afterwards
from a position of strength.” The
fragmented coalition Government en-
dured the Syrian provocations as long
as it could, then it took the steps that
led Nasser to believe that Israel was
about to spring an attack on Syria.
Reacting against what he saw as
likely Israeli retaliation against Syria,
Nasser then put up his bluff against
the UN forces. From the Israel side
of the frontier this looked like the be-
ginning of an Arab plan for war, or at
least a challenge to Israeli invincibility.
The young men disappeared from the
streets, called up as reserves, and
political pressure for a pre-emptive war
began to mount. By May 20, when taxis
were commandeered for the last
reserves, initial mobilisation was com-
plete. But the political parties were still
arguing about the formation of a
National Government and a division of
responsibilities. The people were ready
for war. The Government was not,
but it was surrounded by pressure.
Israel could economically survive the
blockade of Eilat (its dependence on
Eilat had been somewhat exaggerated),
but it could not sustain indefinite
mobilisation. On economic grounds it
could not afford to wait long enough
to discover if Nasser was bluffing or
not. And, even if Nasser was bluffing,
it was hard to see how he could declare
his blockade off without loss of pres-
tige. “How can Nasser get out of this
one?” became “How can we get out of
this one?” To accept the blockade
would destroy the Israeli Government;
it would be an admission that Israel
had lost its deterrent of the blitz-
krieg; it could maintain unity between
the Arab States: and it could invite
the most extreme Arabs to try some-
thing bigger. To take the Arabs on
might further impress them with Israeli
strength and Israel might also pick
up some new territory. The Gaza
Strip perhaps. The rest of Jerusalem.
Perhaps even some defensive positions
west of the Jordan.
Eshkol still tried for an alternative to
war, looking to an international guaran-
tee of access to Eilat or a calling of
Nasser’s bluff by the Maritime Powers
as an answer to those who wanted a
showdown. Afraid that the longer he
waited the greater would become world
pressure on Israel for compromise,
Eshkol waited nevertheless, but he
could get no answer. America and
Britain were tempted by the policies he
proposed, but they privately rejected
them, and of the Western European
nations only the Netherlands gave clear
support. His troops were ready to attack
at 4 a.m. on May 23, but, at President
Johnson’s request, Eshkol held them
back. Then a new Government was
formed, with some of the most formid-
able hawks in some of the positions of
most powerful control, most notably
General Moshe Dayan, who, as Minister
for Defence, took up the role of leader
of the “war party.”
As with other wars, there was mis-
calculation in all camps. Syria tried
Israel’s patience too hard. Israel’s
counter-reactions to Syria went too far.
Nasser reacted with a bluff that he did
not expect to work. U Thant miscalcu-
lated in withdrawing so quickly. Nasser
made a further bluff. America, having
earlier provoked Nasser, then l ater
underestimated his nerve.
Most mysterious of all in this mess
was the extent of Russian involvement
Russia had been supplying arms to
Egypt since 1955, but in itself this did
not mean much. Nasser was no Castro
In fact, he attacked Castro as a national
leader who sold out to a foreign power
As in other Arab States, the Communist
Party was barred in Egypt and the
relations between Egypt and R uss ; a
seemed to be the orthodox relations of
two friendly powers, rather than those
of ideological partners, although
perhaps all the more cordial for that
reason.
The role of the Russians in Syria was
more ambiguous. In their sloganeering
the Syrian leaders had adopted some
of the Marxist revolutionary style, but
their phrases were more like those of
Mao Tse-tung than of Mr. Kosygin.
The Russians kept a mission of 400 in
E)amascus, including 80 military ad-
visers, and it was Syria that, in its
guerilla raids, put revolutionary
rhetoric in action. At the same time
there was evidence that the Russians
in Damascus saw the Syrians as a
rather childish lot, letting themselves in
for more than they could handle. The
Syrian leaders ceased persecuting the
Syrian Communist Party, but it re-
mained illegal. (The only legal Com-
munist Party in the Middle East is in
Israel.)
To what extent were the Russians
urging the Syrians to terrorist tactics?
What assurances, or apparent assur-
ances, did they make to Nasser? How
much did both Syria and Egypt see
Russian interest in their countries as
a deterrent against action from an
America chary of an accidental con-
frontation with its rival super power?
Whatever the answers to these ques-
General Munam Abdul Husseini signs the
surrender of Egypt in the Gaza Strip


King Hussein announces that Jordan has accepted the cease fire
lions, it seemed unlikely that Russia
WO uld have deliberately engineered a
situation that could lead to armed
hostilities in which the chances were
either that its clients would begin by
winning, thereby risking American
intervention, or its clients would begin
by losing, and then demand Russian
intervention. In either case Russia
would be risking both direct con-
frontation and a loss of faith by its
clients.
It seems more likely that Russia,
having by successful diplomacy estab-
lished itself as a power to be reckoned
with in the Middle East, did not wish
to risk losing a position in which it
could embarrass America (bound to
Israel and considered Israel’s principal
protector) and in general in which
it could cause confusion and disagree-
ment between the States of Western
Europe. For once the Russians
were able to act like a great power
in one of the traditional senses of
exercising open influence in an area
far from the homeland without pre-
tending to ideological unity, apart
!rom a few of the phrases of anti-
colonialism. This gave the Russians
an opportunity to deploy their mili-
tary power in the classical sense; it
gave them some of the flexibilities and
options of the rival super power; it
gave them a new kind of prestige
in which they could iee to it that
America did not win in the Middle
East. They were enjoying a kind of
bargaining power they had never
enjoyed before. If they had prompted
Nasser into his actions they risked
losing the lot, and a super - power
confrontation as well.
It seemed more likely that the
Russians, enmeshed with Nasser and
Syria, were pulled into the muddle
in a way that limited their options
and flexibility. If they went into
it deliberately they must have both
overestimated Nasser and under-
estimated Israel. Given the fact that
everybody else miscalculated this, is,
°f course, possible. However, what-
ever the reason, their friendship with
%pt and Syria meant that before
the war began the Russians sabotaged
a ny attempt at joint great power or
UN action for peace.
It would be wrong to assume that
only American fear of provoking Russia
into a direct confrontation kept the
Americans from acting more decisively
when Nasser announced his blockade.
It would also be wrong to assume that
America stayed silent because it was
overcommitted in Vietnam. It would be
equally wrong to assume that general
American support for Israel, the in-
fluence of the Jewish vote in places like
New York, and the general loathing of
Nasser would otherwise have pushed
America into instant defence of Israel’s
right to use the Straits of Tiran. There
was, in fact, within the American ad-
ministration considerable distrust of the
Israeli blitzkriegers, particularly because
of the private deals and manipulations
that went on before the Israeli push of
1956. These have never been forgiven.
And, although America had its own
clients among the Arabs, particularly
Saudi Arabia and Libya, it did not see
the Middle East with the almost hysteri-
cal concern that is sometimes given to
it by Europeans.
The principal American reactions
were a mixture of contempt for Nasser
and concern about the Israeli hawks.
The State Department theory of Nasser
was that he was a mountebank, not to
be taken too seriously, a bluffer whose
bluff could be called. They thought he
was acting from weakness, with his own
country’s economy falling apart, with
40,000 of his troops tied down in a
meaningless war in the Yemen, and
with his face lost in the Arab world.
In this case they underestimated his
boldness, but even after he had come up
again unexpectedly as leader of the
Arabs and made his Aqaba threats they
thought that with patience some way
would be found of saving his face over
Aqaba without harming the real
interests of Israel. All the Americans
wanted was time. They assumed the
Russians would not push their own
clients too far.
To the Americans the principal prob-
lem was the war party in Israel. They
had no doubt that they could sustain
the Israeli economy over a period of
diplomatic crisis and they expressed
some private criticism of Israeli spokes-
men for exaggerating the economic
importance of the port of Eilat, which
the Americans did not consider essential
to Israel’s survival. Remembering 1956,
they suspected that the Israelis might
push into war so that they could annex
new territory. So to pleas of help from
Israel President Johnson returned pleas
for patience and caution, thereby,
according to the hawks, merely post-
poning Israeli surprise action so long
that it might lose its surprise or,
according to the doves, leading to a
situation which would make inevitable
an Israeli campaign.
Johnson, who does not enjoy the
excitements of decision as Kennedy
did, was slow to make up his' mind
about any particular policy and 'talked
mainly of difficulties, especially when
he discovered that, apart from Britain
and Holland, the Maritime Powers were
reluctant to challenge the blockade.
There was a great volume of diplomatic
activity, but it did not produce any-
thing. In a situation in which the world
was beginning to see a victory for
Russian great power diplomacy, in
which European critics of his Vietnam
policy were now criticising him for
appeasement and in which he was aware
that a wrong word from America might
bring the Russians in more clearly than
they were, Johnson decided to keep an
outward silence. If his counsels to the
Israelis did not prevail he at least
wanted to make sure that if they took
military action off their own bat, they
took it without American commitment
or obvious involvement. Maintaining
the President’s silence became one of
the most important tasks of his aides,
even down to an attempt to smuggle
the Israeli Foreign Minister into the
White House so that he could see the
President secretly.
The silence provided Johnson with a
very great domestic political problem
that was solved for him by the talk-
ativeness of Mr. Harold Wilson.
Anxious to cut a scene on every stage,
and unimpressed by de Gaulle’s non-
commitment, Wilson first sent his
Foreign Minister to Moscow (where the
Russians had nothing to say to him)
and then sent himself to Washington.
The British Cabinet was divided and
on the whole reluctant that Britain
should play an active part. They
feared that British scene-stealing might
destroy confidence in the pound; it
could lead to Arab reprisals, by sterling
withdrawals and seizure or sabotage of
oil installations; and it could provide
a further demonstration to de Gaulle
that Britain did not see itself as a
partner of Europe but as a special
ally of America. Nevertheless, because
of British emotions about Suez, Wilson
felt that he must talk. He talked so
much in London, and then in Wash-
ington, that although he privately
boasted that he hadn’t said anything
significant, the American administra-
tion used his talkativeness in such a
way that there seemed to be, for a
while, a “British initiative” which
sounded all right and to which John-
son seemed somehow to be committed
without saying so on an issue that
Americans were now seeing as part of
a revived cold war. That gave Johnson
more time to think. As it turned out,
it didn’t give him enough time.




The other Edinburgh
Part two of two parts by
BATMAN
IT IS GENERALLY agreed that Prince
Alfred planted more trees, laid more
foundation stones, turned more sods
than any other royal visitor ever to
come to this country.
HRH Prince Alfred, Duke of Edin-
burgh, 23 years old, second son of
Queen Victoria, was here from October
30, 1867, to April 6, 1868, so centen-
aries for noble buildings should be
coming up everywhere. The young
Duke was indefatigable. He did so
much of this sort of thing that one
royal tour reporter even quoted Hamlet:
“What, will the line stretch out to the
crack of doom?”
His chief relaxation was shooting
and the carnage was spread out across
five colonies. In the moonlight in the
Adelaide Hills he shot 50 possums. Fie
went on numerous kangaroo shoots and
at the property of Thomas Austin,
Barwon Park, near Geelong, he shot,
personally, 86 rabbits, then the next
day he shot 416 in 3| hours. Altogether
his party shot 1300. Sydney “Punch”
commented:
“ ’Tis with certainty stated
They died quite elated
Being shot by a live Prince, you see.
And I hear ’tis said now
That the upper crust vow
Their chief diet shall rabbit be.”
Again, no other royal tour has had
such a gift for disaster. In Melbourne,
the Orangemen put a great transpar-
ency on the Protestant Hall in Stephen
St. It had a centrepiece Britannia with
King William 111 on one side and
Victoria on the other with the sign
THIS WE WILL MAINTAIN. The
Irish-Catholics were livid and they
stormed the building. In the midst of
the disturbance there was a volley of
shots from an upstairs window and
three were wounded. A boy of 14
died later from chest wounds.
At Bendigo there was a great pro-
cession. A group of small boys manned
a model of the Duke’s ship, HMS
Galatea. The crowd threw fireworks
and one piece landed in a box of roman
candles and rockets aboard the model.
“HMS Galatea” blew up and three
boys died from burns.
Then Bendigo built a special Alfred
Hall for the royal ball, but while the
lamps were being lit the curtains caught
fire and it burned to the ground. For-
tunately the supper was in another
building and HRH was still able to
eat.
Sydney, however, was waiting to
demonstrate how a royal tour should
be handled. The “Sydney Morning
Herald” pointed out that the naval
display would be on a greater scale
than anything Port Jackson had ever
witnessed.
January 21 was arrival day. Ships of
every size and description were towed
to fixed points in the harbor. Then
two flotillas of steamers were prepared
for the official reception. Flotilla num-
ber one, of 22 steamers, assembled off
Fort Denison, and Flotilla number two,
of 24 smaller steamers, assembled at
Watson’s Bay. Then, at a given signal,
they came together and steamed out
through the Heads.
The ships were packed with official
parties, women, and children. There
were sumptuous lunches and the
champagne flowed freely. Outside the
Heads a stiff easterly was blowing and
the rain came down.
As the “SMH” pointed out, most
of the ladies had never been on a trip
farther than Manly Beach and from
then on there was considerable internal
disquiet. But then, to the south-east,
they saw the Galatea. “All eyes turned
toward her. There was but one opinion
expressed of her beautiful proportions,
immense size, and noble appearance.”
And so HMS Galatea, steaming majes-
tically in front, entered Port Jackson
with “the largest, the fastest, the finest
in the colonies following behind her.”
Thousands had gathered on South
HMS Galatea, which brought Prince
Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, to Austra-
lia, in Port Jackson
Head to witness the scene. Bonfires
were lit on every headland. But, alas,
the rain drenched down. Maybe it
quenched the bonfires and the illum-
inations, but, as the “SMH” said, it
had to contend with the “less quench-
able sparks of loyalty which animated
every breast.”
Afterwards there were illuminations,
the fireworks, the royal balls, a royal
regatta, plus a military review in the
Domain. The triumphal arches were
imposing, particularly an enormous
“marble arch” built at Circular Quay.
“Punch” said it looked like an “inverted
boiler.”
The Prince went off on a five-day
tour of Queensland, where he visited
Brisbane, laid the foundation stone of
Brisbane Grammar, and visited Too-
woomba and the Darling Downs.
He returned to Sydney, and the most
famous event of the tour took place
on March 12. It was a general holiday
and with six steamers and two yacht
squadrons Prince Alfred sailed to
Clontarf for the Sailors’ Home Picnic
He arrived at 2 p.m., had lunch, left
the luncheon tent with the wife of the
Governor, the Countess of Belmore, and
then indicated that he wished to speak
to Sir William Manning.
They walked across the green together
and Prince Alfred pointed out to Sir
William that the Sailors’ Home was a
cause dear to his heart and he handed
over a cheque.
Sir William was just saying his thanks
when a man left the crowd under the
trees, walked up behind them, pulled
out a revolver and fired. The Prince
fell forward on his knees and cried:
“Good God, my back has been broken!”
Sir William jumped at the attacker,
later identified as Henry J. O’Farrell.
O’Farrell pulled the trigger again, but
the revolver didn’t go off. Manning,
trying to avoid the shot, fell to the
ground. Before he was overpowered,
O’Farrell fired again and a man was
wounded in the foot.
A large number of women had
hysterics, others fainted. There were
cries of “Lynch him. Lynch him.” There
was a rush to get him, and before he
was rescued by the police all the cloth-
ing from the upper part of his body
was torn off, his eyes, face, and body
were bruised and he was bleeding. He
appeared to be unconscious when he
was dragged aboard the steamer Pater-
son.
There, according to the “Sydney
Morning Herald,” the sailors tried to
get him and they had a rope ready to
string him up. He was saved only at
the intervention of Lord Newry.
As for the Prince, it was discovered
that the bullet had entered two inches
from the spine, passed through the
muscles of the back and round by the
ribs to the front of the abdomen. He
did not lose consciousness. He was suf-
fering “intense pain” when carried
aboard the steamer Morpeth.
The “Herald” said: “One universal
feeling of sorrow, shame, and rage per-
vades the community. The whole colony
has been wounded in the presence of
its royal guest. A crime which every-
one will repudiate with horror has
shadowed our reputation. We need use
no words to paint the blackness of the
deed. We have not a reader who does
not feel its enormity to the fullest
extent.”
The Melbourne “Argus” said: “What
will they say of us in England when
they hear the news? —is the question
everybody asks. The royal progress
through South Australia and Victoria
Vivid representation of the attempted assassination of the Duke of Edinburgh at Clontarf, near Sydney
was marked by no such bloody incident,
but the distinction will not be generally
appreciated in England.”
The Prince was out of danger by
March 18, but in every colony there
were the most extraordinary demonstra-
tions, the like of which haven’t been
seen since. In Sydney there was a huge
“Indignation Meeting” at the pavilion
in Hyde Park, the same pavilion that
bad been built for the royal ball. “A
larger meeting, more respectful and
more unanimous, never gathered in the
colonies,” said the “Herald.” There were
meetings in all the suburbs, North
Sydney, Redfern, and away in New-
castle.
In Victoria there were meetings at
Hawthorn, Williamstown, Brunswick,
Fitzroy, Emerald Hills, Geelong, Kyne-
ton, Ballarat, Sandhurst, Sale, Hamil-
ton, Wangaratta, Woods Point, and at
Jbe Exhibition there was a loyalty meet-
ing of 6000. George Higinbotham, later
t? be Chief Justice, moved the resolu-
tion, “That the intelligence of the
a ttempt made to assassinate HRH Duke
°f Edinburgh has filled the inhabitants
of this city with the deepest grief and
indignation.”
Later both cities used money raised
at such meetings for the building of
Prince Alfred Hospitals to commemor-
ate the royal visit.
At the police court, before he was
committed for trial, H. J. O’Farrell,
who was born in Melbourne of Irish
descent, told how he was one of ten
under direct instructions from the
Fenian movement in Ireland who had
drawn lots as to who would kill the
Duke.
This caused great anti-Irish feeling
everywhere. The N.S.W. Governor, the
Earl of Belmore, withdrew his
patronage from the St. Patrick’s Day
Regatta, the St. Patrick’s Ball was can-
celled, Mr. Aspinall, who defended
O’Farrell in his trial at the Criminal
Court, was blackballed by his club.
The trial lasted two days and the jury
took less than an hour to reach its ver-
dict. Mr. Aspinall brought much
evidence that O’Farrell was of unsound
mind, that he had suffered from drink,
delirium tremens, and his relatives had
been advised that he should have been
committed to a lunatic asylum.
But the jury found him guilty, and
Mr. Justice Cheeke, when passing sen-
tence, said: “I hold out for you not the
least hope of remission from death.”
O’Farrell’s sister, Caroline Allen, sent
a petition to the Governor, saying she
was absolutely convinced that her
brother was out of his mind when he
shot the Duke.
However, O’Farrell, quietly and with
great dignity, went to the scaffold on
April 21. He left a letter saying he
hadn’t told the truth. He was not con-
nected with any Fenian movement and
he therefore had no accomplices.
On April 6, with the Duke very
healthy and laying foundation stones
once again, HMS Galatea sailed for
home. The “Sydney Morning Herald”
on that day printed a poem which
finished:
“Behold him there
A dim seen form on yon receding
deck!
He flies, pursued by blessing and
regret
To pour a true tale into trusting
ears —
To clasp fond arms around a mother’s
neck
And sum all mem’ries of Australia’s
son
In one brief record ‘Oh! They love
us well!’ ”

In Japan—JOßS FOR LIFE
IN JAPAN, to employers and
employees alike, a job is the position
someone takes up when he leaves school
and remains in until the day he re-
tires. The Japanese institution of “life-
long” employment applies to perman-
ent employees, and hence the majority
of the labor force, and became en-
trenched only after World War 11.
It is related to the role Japanese
society expects industrial enterprises
to play. Besides a productive function,
they must also fulfil a social one. These
enterprises have come to be regarded
as an industrial family. The employee,
rather than hired, is adopted as a
member of the family, and his partici-
pation in the family is larger than his
actual contribution in terms of skill.
His contribution is rather in terms of
human resource. In return, he is given
status in a society where the individual
has little depth.
As a member of the family, the
employee receives the cash which each
enterprise, as a unit in the overall
society, judges necessary for his sub-
sistence. Wages, therefore, follow norms
primarily set by society. The concept
of “wage” includes basic salary, about
70 percent, and allowances, about 30
percent. Annual earnings, including sub-
stantial seasonal allowances, are
divided about equally between the basic
salary and allowances. Labor unions
have so far respected such a wage
structure, because it expresses the life-
long employment institution they
defend. Wage problems for Japan’s
organised labor are of amounts, not of
structure.
Japanese unions manifest little in-
terest in sharing welfare responsibilities
with management, and certainly do not
wish to shoulder them. In the lifelong
concept there are benefits additional to
the cash ones, ranging from birth-
control clinics to marriage brokerage
and funerals. The work place is not
a second home; for all practical pur-
poses (except the procreation of chil-
dren) it looks like the home, even to
the extent of living-in for many of the
workers. In recent years, however,
firms have started to help workers buy
their own homes rather than provide
company accommodation.
Company stores or privileged pur-
chasing arrangements are provided by-
most firms, where their own goods and
those of related firms can be obtained
with a substantial rebate. In times of
cash stringency, company goods are
often given free, up to a certain per-
centage of the seasonal allowance.
Company dining-rooms with food as
well as medical and sanitary services,
at a nominal cost, are common. Moun-
tain and sea resorts are dotted with
company “villas,” where employees and
their families can spend several days
at low cost. Private car ownership has
barely started in Japan, but many pas-
senger cars are driven at company ex-
pense; membership in golf clubs is
mostly an expense for management,
starting at section chief and up.
But a much more significant benefit
in the context of participative employ-
ment is the long-standing practice of
intra-company saving and financing
schemes. A survey conducted by the
Ministry of Labor revealed that, in
March, 1963, 33,000 firms sponsored
intra-company saving schemes covering
4,100,000 depositors, whose savings
amounted to a gross total of nearly
SAI2OO million, and are said to have
more than doubled since. On these
deposits, the company pays a much
higher interest than financial institu-
tions, usually ten percent per year.
Most salaries are paid once a month.
For the employee, this is the income
from which daily expenditures are
paid; for the firm, the monthly pay-
ment means that a substantial expendi-
ture has to be faced only once a
month, thereby easing considerably the
flow of working capital. But at least
twice a year, seasonal allowances are
paid. For the employee, this income
defrays the purchase of durable con-
sumer goods and feeds savings; for the
firm, it means again a payroll cost
delayed for six months, and much
elbow-room, since the amount of such
allowances is still largely determined
by business conditions.
Lastly, at the end of the employ-
ment period, a retirement allowance is
paid. For the employee, this income
represents finally a capital sum meant
to buttress further security; for the
enterprise, it is, however, a deferred
wage payment that all through the
employment period depressed the actual
salary, which again greatly helped the
flow of funds. “
All through his career, the employee
has, through the wage system, invested
heavily in the enterprise on a short-
as well as long-term basis. It has cost
the employer fairly little, namely cer
tain impossibility of firing the employee'
but the gain in terms of working capital
and steadiness of the labor force has
been considerable.
Commencing salaries are fairly uni-
form among large firms; they all start a
salary curve that will continue for the
next 30-odd years of employment. The
amount is close to the subsistence level
for a young bachelor without any
social obligations; The recent labor
shortage has caused a raise in the start-
ing wage that dangerously tips the life-
long salary curve.
The amounts increase, mostly yearly
in a fairly automatic fashion. The curve
is always positive, but the rate of in-
crease fluctuates. In the initial years
the increase is fairly slow; this is the
time when the firm provides training,
and the employee is still a bachelor!
Then the slope becomes steeper as
family obligations begin to burden the
employee and his contribution to the
firm increases. Later on, the rate of in-
crease slows down again as some
stability in social obligations is reached.
It is quite obvious that the salary
system is not geared to rewarding in-
dividual efficiency, somehow felt alien
to the concept of lifelong employment.
Efficiency plays, however, a definite
role, but rather at the level of the
group; it amounts to the efficient per-
formance of the firm or enterprise. For
the individual, therefore, there is little
distinction, if any, between efficiency
and loyalty to the enterprise.
In recent years, there have been
attempts to pay what is often presented
as an outright efficiency wage the
deathknell of the lifetime salary system.
It is mostly referred to as “grade
system.” The truth of the matter, how-
ever, is that these attempts are not yet
what one could call revolutionary. Most
of them result in a variation of the
prevailing system, granting explicit con-
sideration to efficiency no longer by a
special allowance, but in the progres-
sion of the basic salary.
At first sight, a lifelong employment
system looks like vestiges of bygone
ages, ill-suited to present-day economic
progress. But the “economic miracle
of Japan rested precisely on those in-
dustrial sectors where the lifetime
system became entrenched and is now
standard practice. What seems like a
brake on progress appears, in fact, to
be one of the driving forces for diversi-
fication and expansion of operations.
In the fast-moving world of Japans
economic development, lifelong employ-
ment is not a static institution; the
problems it creates will probably not be
solved by its disappearance, but by its
adaptation.

report)


How do you cast new light
on Paradise?
p*
More light is on its way to Paradise Island, Bahamas. It’s to be provided
by a new power station on nearby New Providence Island, which is to be
equipped throughout with alternators, switchgear, transformers, motors
and motor starters built and installed by Brush Electrical Engineering—a
Hawker Siddeley company. Brush will supervise everything from the
clearing of land to the final handing over of the key when everything
is complete.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
Brush-Hawker Siddeley Engineering Department is soon
to begin work on a complete new power station to supply
extra electrical power to the islands of Paradise and New
Providence in the Bahamas.
This is nothing new for Brush. They’ve done it more
than 30 times before. And they will be doing it again in
Tanzania, Libya, Antigua and Iran. Their long experience
in building electrical equipment and supervising the
various phases of power station development is world-
proved. It is this sort of expertise that makes Brush and
their export organisation, Hawker Siddeley Electrical
(Export) Ltd., such a valuable part of the Hawker Siddeley
industrial group.
Power stations are only one facet of the Hawker Siddeley
story.
Hawker Siddeley products go down on the farm —haul
trains —steer and power ships—probe space—roll roads—
fly people—store heat —pack food—fuel aircraft. And
maintain a daily turnover of more than $A2§ million.
That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a world-size
group. With group power.

Modern Motor Readers' Poll, 1967
Winner BEST ALL-ROUNDER category
ROVER 2000
\vc expected to win
surprised even us!
Know why ?
In the ‘Best Luxury Compact’ section of Modern Motor’s
readers’ poll, we had some fairly healthy competition:
Cars like the □ Daimler 2.5 □ Jaguar 3.8 S and
□ Lancia Flaminia, plus the □ Chrysler Regal □ Fiat
2300 □ Falcon Fairmont □ Flolden Premier □ Nissan
Cedric De Luxe and the □ Triumph 2000. Still, we
weren’t too surprised to win this one. It was winning the
“Best All-rounder” category that really tickled us. For
this was the question asked: “Which current model,
regardless of cost, would you choose as the best all-round
car?” You know, we really expected people to go for the
Rolls. We really did. Or perhaps, since the Bond epics,
the Aston Martin DB6. But no, our Rover 2000 took it
out comfortably. Seems that the average Australian
motorist agrees with the' motoring authorities and writers
around the world who have heaped laurels on the Rover
2000 to the point of making us blush. Of course, this was
Rover’s avowed intention when they created the 2000
to make it the ultimate “all-round” car. Not just a mag-
nificently-appointed luxury car. Not just a rip-roaring
sports car. Not just a long-loping, mile-eating G.T. car.
Not just the world’s safest car. Not any single one of these
but all of them. If you’ve never before driven four cars
simultaneously, you’ve a treat in store. How about today?

AFTER 179 YEARS...
The
Battle
For
Botany
Bay
WHEN GOVERNOR PHILLIP
looked at the bay in which he
had brought his small fleet to
anchor and at which he was sup-
posed to start his penal colony it
seemed so unsuitable for this or for any
other purpose that he did not even
bother to unpack his ships. He got
into a small boat and went up the
coast looking for something better.
For the next 100 years Sydney Town
preferred to forget about Botany Bay,
although it was only five miles away.
Sydney spread west instead of south.
Seagulls squawked above its shal-
low waters (only 12 feet at their
deepest); limeburners burnt shells on its
mangrove flats and sand dunes; the
easterlies blew over its bleak forests.
Then, in the 1880 s, when the new rail-
way and that great Australian inven-
tion the Torrens Title made the modern
suburb possible, some of the world’s
first working-class suburbs sprouted
along Botany Bay’s western shores, as
families from the terrace houses res-
ponded to advertisements drawing to
the attention of “mechanics and labor-
ers that they may now secure a subur-
ban home with sufficient land to enjoy
the luxury and all the material advan-
tages of large vegetable- and flower-
gardens in an Arcadia of fresh green
paddocks, gentle slopes, beautiful
orchards, and neat, homelike cottages.”
The eastern reaches of the bay were
later given over to oyster farming and
yachtsmen, golfers, Aborigines, wind,
an airport, and a power station. Now
the Battle for Botany Bay has begun.
There are photographs of bewildered
officials trailing along its grass-tufted
sand. Ship magnates look hungrily
toward Malabar and Botany. House-
holders’ front fences disappear into the
water with the building of the new air-
port runway. And there is talk of
another airport at Towra Point.
The present impetus of a city looking
for new places in which to conduct its
business at first manifested itself when
a Caltex subsidiary built a refinery in
the middle of 400 acres of sandhills and
swamp. Now 3,150,000 imperial gallons
of oil flow through a pipeline anchored
to the bottom of the bay. But the
battle proper began when, in 1960, the
Maritime Services Board talked about
deepening the bay and putting up
wharves. Heady talk flew round. The
Banksmeadow Golf Course and Joseph
Banks Park were estimated to be worth
$20,000 an acre. A $6O-million urban-
development plan for Kurnell Penin-
sula was knocked back because it cut
across the Maritime Services Board’s
ambitions. At this stage someone had
forked out that the proposed port
would cost about $4O million.
In the meantime the private land
dealers got busy with their own plans.
Guns set up in the 19th century co
defend us from the Russians still guard
Botany Bay
The most successful of them was L. J.
Hooker, who bought 500 acres near
Kurnell. Since then, according to Mr.
A. S. Vogan, Hooker’s N.S.W. mana-
ger, some 45 plans have been drawn
up. Hooker’s first plans were for a
canal-type subdivision in which bits
of the bay were to be sold, along with
allotments. But by then the Maritime
Services Board had been given con-
trol of all the water in Botany Bay (and
in Newcastle, for good measure) by
the N.S.W. Parliament, so Hooker’s
put up other types of plans. All they
can do for the moment is to sell some
of the sand they have bought it was
the sand the horses of the movie “Forty
Thousand Horsemen” galloped over
toward the cameras and re-grade.
Until the Government committees make
up their minds Hooker’s don’t know
what they’re re-grading for, but pre-
sumably whatever happens to the area
it will have to be re-graded.
The Federal Government further
complicated the picture by announcing
in 1961 the extension of the north-
south runway at Sydney Airport into
Botany Bay at a cost of $6 million. In
the end, after dredging up 4 million
tons of sand, this cost $l2 million.
Meanwhile, the Maritime Services
Board became worried about whether
it could deepen the bay and called in
the Wallingford Hydraulic Research
Establishment of Britain. Wallingford
built a model and decided, yes, it was
OK to dig big holes in the bay. Then,
after a big hole was dug to get sand
for the runway, an overnight storm
swept away the sandy beach from the
Rockdale Baths to President Avenue.
The beach reappeared gradually, piling
up on Grand Parade.
The Federal Government quoted the
Wallingford report to suggest that
this really hadn’t happened or, if it
had happened, it was merely the
southerlies that had done it. Then
Wallingford investigated again and
came up with another answer. The
hole should have been rectangular but
it had been dug hole-like instead, just
like any other hole. Helped by the
knowledge that if the right kind of hole
had been dug their beach might not
have been washed away, the Rockdale
Council is replacing and patching and
rebuilding as best it can. It holds
regular conferences now with various
Government departments that dig holes,
make plans, and so forth. They are
even beginning to build up something
of an ethos at Rockdale to the effect
that the noise of jets overhead might
as well be in their suburb “since it
has to be somewhere.”
In any case they have something else
to worry about now. Some of the air-
port men feel that Sydney might need
a second airport at Towra Point by
the 1980 s. No one has worked on the
idea yet, but to the Rockdale Council
a second airport will presumably make
some difference to its “Arcadia ... of
neat homelike cottages.”
The latest thrust of policy in the
colonisation of Botany Bay comes from
the development of containerisation. The
proposal for a full-scale port is up
again, with a plan that would cost $9O
million, twice the quote made in 1960.
Engineering feasibility studies have been
at work, including a plan for three
breakwaters that would remove one of
the reasons why Governor Phillip had
to discover Sydney.
In making plans for the planning of
Botany Bay a committee has now been
set up to investigate the other commit-
tees investigating the bay. At the head
of it is Mr. A. D. Bridges, a N.S.W.
Cabinet Minister. Officially Mr. Bridges
is the Minister for Child Welfare and
Advisory Minister for Transport, but
his most heroic role is that of Defender
of Mascot against Tullamarine. There is
no sign yet that the tradition of prepar-
ing for Botany Bay plans that won’t
work has departed from the precedent
first set in 1788.


OVERSEAS
Rebellion: so that was
Nigeria, that was
OIL LIES heavily on the waters of the
current trouble in Nigeria, the populous
nation which was the hopeful model
for other young African democracies
until the recent secession of its eastern
region, now declared to be the in-
dependent republic of Biafra.
Taking the name of the new State
from a Nigerian coastal inlet, the
Bight of Biafra, Oxford-educated Lieut.-
Col. Odumegwu Ojukwu, 33, declared
himself military governor of the
region. This Niger River delta area
last year produced $255 million worth
of crude oil, and also enriched the
Nigerian Federation with exports of
coal and palm-oil products.
There has been persistent inter-tribal
conflict in Nigeria ever since indepen-
dence from Britain in 1960, much of
it directed at the astute eastern Ibos,
who already number 12 million in
Biafra, with more arriving daily, flee-
ing from the threat of civil war.
The scales w r ere tipped in favor of
secessionist agitation when Lieut.-Col.
Yabuku Gowon, military head of the
Federal Government in L a g o s,
attempted to create 12 States, three of
them in the eastern region. The Ibos
saw this as a jealous bid to separate
them from their oil-bearing delta, and
with a declaration by Colonel Gowon
that the “act of rebellion” would be
crushed, Nigeria seemed ready to break
up.
Colonel Ojukwu is suggesting a con-
federation of autonomous States with
common services, dual citizenship, and
a customs union. This is something like
the present entente between the Ivory
Coast, Upper Volta, Niger, Dahomey,
and Togoland. But the experience of
running common services among Afri-
can States with a past history of hos-
tility is not an encouraging one. Still,
if Colonel Gowon were to accept this,
there might be a chance of saving the
economic unity of Nigeria, which mat-
ters to Biafra, too.
A campaign by Colonel Gowon to
subdue the rebel east by the use of his
northern troops might meet political
difficulties in Lagos itself. Western
leaders not unreasonably regard the
prospect of civil war with some mis-
giving; they also have their own tribal
axes to grind. A march on the oil-
bearing regions of the delta would have
to be made across difficult country by
the small body of troops available
against the opposition of such forces
as are at Colonel Ojukwu’s disposition.
A more probable course for Colonel
Cowon would be to try to use what
remains of the Nigerian Navy, after the
departure of its Ibo crews, to blockade
Port Harcourt in Biafra, which is vul-
Colonel Ojukwu ... secessionist leader
Colonel Gowon ... into civil war?
nerable to such tactics. If that han-
pened, much would depend on the
attitude of oil-buying countries whose
tankers would have been held up at a
time when Middle Eastern supplies
seem in jeopardy. It may, indeed, have
been this calculation which lay behind
the choice of a moment for the procla-
mation of the new State.
Whatever happens now, the outlook
in Nigeria is bleak. Africa’s most pop u .
lous nation (57 million) could have
done without a new Indo-Pakistan
situation. An experienced diplomat
remarked not so long ago, “If Nigeria
goes, there is no hope for the rest of
West Africa.” Now Nigeria has gone.
Political credibility will come to the
Biafra republic if it can prove itself
the de facto government in commercial
terms. The biggest event in Biafra’s
calendar will therefore be the date of
the next oil revenue payments from
Shell-BP and Gulf Oil early next
month. All Nigeria’s oil flows through
the east two-thirds of it is produced
there. If Colonel Ojukwu can main-
tain a degree of normalcy in com-
mercial operations, he could well see
Biafra’s proportion of the next quarterly
oil cheque being paid direct into his
treasury.

Hong Kong
Riot reflections
IT BEGINS to look as if Chairman
Mao bit off more than he could chew
in Hong Kong. It is too early to be sure
of victory; and it would be a psycholog-
ical blunder, in a game where face
matters so much, for Britain to claim
it too loud or too soon. But the Hong
Kong Government deserves a quiet cheer
for having outfaced Peking over the
Communist-led happenings in the
colony. The Communists must have
calculated that it would be only a mat-
ter of weeks from the first trouble at
the artificial-flower factory before the
Hong Kong authorities would be cry-
ing enough. Then the Communists
would call off their mobs in return
for humiliating concessions approaching
those foisted on the Portuguese in
Macao in February.
But things have not worked out that
way. Buses, ferries, and factories have
been running, if not on time; the stock
market has been dealing again, if bear-
ishly. Many of the police have been
given their first post-crisis leave. And

home on leave too, it was reported,
Men t the local Hong Kong Communist
leaders, who have been summoned to
China for an accounting of the anti-
imperialist struggle that failed.
phe Hong Kong Communists are
probably being read the riot act for
mishandling the recent demonstrations.
g u t they may be on the carpet for a
more serious error misjudging the
revolutionary potential in the colony.
It is a basic principle of a people’s war
that the warriors must have the sup-
port of the surrounding population.
And shortly after the Communists
went out on the barricades in Kowloon
it became clear that popular support
was just what they didn’t have.
Revulsion of the majority of the
people of Hong Kong, more than any-
thing else, must have made the Com-
munists revise their calculations.
Either way, the leaders of Hong
Kong’s Communists lose. They may
already have lost effective power
like so many party officials on the
mainland to a new revolutionary
mass organisation with a catchy title.
The one that has just been set up in
the colony is called “the Committee of
Hong Kong-Kowloon Compatriots of
All Circles to Fight Against Persecu-
tion by the British Authorities in Hong
Kong.”
If China decides that the Hong
Kong effort misfired because of mis-
management, it may be briefing a new
team on the strategy for a new assault,
and planning new moves from China
as well. But if it decides that Hong
Kong isn’t ripe for revolution after all,
then the next step will be to disengage
Peking’s prestige from the whole adven-
ture. It looks as if the Chinese may
already have started on this process. In
the latest “People’s Daily” commentary
on Hong Kong, it was left to “our
patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong
and Kowloon” to “thoroughly settle the
account of the towering crimes” com-
mitted by British imperialism. It sounds
a bit like fighting to the last Viet-
namese.

cidents in the capital, and result in a
further deterioration of the country’s
political situation.
Both men enjoy considerable support
from various sectors of the electorate.
General Thieu not only commands the
loyalty of a part of the Army as well
as some Catholics but has also managed
to maintain good relationships—unlike
his opponent —with representatives of
South Vietnam’s political parties.
Although born in the southern part of
Central Vietnam, Thieu has the addit-
ional advantage of being considered g
“southerner.” With two other noted
southerners, Mr. Pham Khac Suu and
Mr. Tran Van Huong, also in the
race, however, it is doubtful this will
prove to be a very useful asset.
Like Thieu, General Ky is also prob-
ably counting on the support of a
number of Army officers. The election
threatens thus to split the Army into
two rival blocks, a situation fraught with
dangerous possibilities. Besides the
military, Ky as a Northerner
also looks to North Vietnamese refugees
as well as to the youth with whom
he enjoys some influence for back-
ing. Above all, as chief of the govern-
ment for the past two years, he com-
mands much of the loyalty of the
Administration.
Possibly the only point on which
General Ky and General Thieu agree
with regard to the election is that
no civilian should become President.
Ironically, the fact that the two
strongest candidates are both from the
Army is probably the most effective
means of ensuring this result. In any
event, the man who wins will enjoy
very broad governing powers at
least for a few months thanks to
the electoral law, which stipulates that
General Ky. .. the stakes are high

China
Targets of hate
PEKING HAS singled out another new
target Mongolia in what appears
to be a hate campaign against a grow-
ing list of foreign countries. While
China’s relations with Britain continue
to deteriorate despite the apparent
thaw in political tensions in Hong Kong
several thousand demonstrators
swarmed outside the Mongolian embassy
to protest against “fascist violence”
committed against Chinese nationals
in Ulan Bator. Meanwhile the increas-
ing escalation of the Vietnam war
perhaps the most crucial problem for
China’s foreign policy is barely re-
flected, either in the posters or in the
mass demonstrations on the streets of
Peking. The main focus of the capital’s
latest rally was the Palestinian Arabs,
who have received continuous support
including possibly the supply of
arms from China for the past
several years.
Anger first flared up against Mon-
golia when Mongolian authorities de-
cided to expel three Chinese teachers
at a primary school for Chinese nat-
ionals in Ulan Bator for allegedly
spreading Chinese propaganda in the
city. According to the New China news
agency, “Hsinhua,” Mongolia deliber-
erately provoked a minor incident in-
volving the three Chinese to use as a
pretext for their expulsion. On May 21,
a group of over 200 Chinese in-
cluding a “Hsinhua” correspondent and
Chinese diplomatic personnel went
to the railway station to see the three
teachers off, despite official Mongolian
warnings not to do so. A fight between
the Chinese and Mongolian police
the latter described by “Hsinhua’ as
“agents in plain clothes, wearing dark
eyeglasses and hats cocked” ensued,
and the police reportedly hit and then
arrested more than 20 Chinese, in-
cluding the “Hsinhua” correspondent.
Several Chinese diplomats were roughly
treated and detained for a short while,
according to the official Chinese report.
A strong protest has been handed
over to the Mongolian Government de-
manding that all Chinese citizens jailed

immediately, that the Mongolian
authorities apologise for violence
against Chinese citizens, and that the
safety of Chinese Embassy personnel
and citizens in Mongolia be ensured.
The Mongolians, however, have claimed
that the railway incident was pro-
voked by the Chinese.
Other victims of China’s growing
embitterment with foreigners were 19
members of a Danish tourist group, who
were subjected to organised criticism
and humiliation by Red Guards in
Hangchow. During a recent meeting
with university people in Shanghai, one
of the tourists, a Danish journalist, had
allegedly insulted Chairman Mao and
the Chinese people. The following day,
when the group arrived at Hangchow,
its scheduled program was cancelled,
and it was surrounded by 250 Red
Ulan Bator... in trouble with Peking
Guards together with representatives
from the Chinese travel agency in
charge of the tour who demanded a
self-criticism, recitation from Mao’s
works, and a guarantee that similar
insulting remarks would not be re-
peated in the future.
China’s seeming preoccupation with
finding new enemies abroad may well
be a reflection of increasing unrest and
dissatisfaction with the progress of
the Cultural Revolution at home.
Recent wall posters in Peking have
described the situation in China’s fluid
frontier province of Sinkiang as being
nearly as difficult for the revolution-
aries as in Szechuan - the scene last
month of violent clashes between pro-
Mao and anti-Mao forces.
The situation is said to have be-
come particularly serious since April,
when a new wave of suppression of
revolutionary activities began. Accord-
ing to a Red Guard group, which has
come to Peking from Sinkiang, there
have been numerous “bloody” incidents
involving revolutionary rebel organisa-
tions, workers, and peasants in the
region.

ENTERTAINMENT
Something of an iceberg
By PHILLIP ADAMS
“MR- ADAMS,” Mr. Von Sternberg
said, “y° u have got off on the wrong
foot.” He was tired and irritable after
a Press conference and now some fool
W as asking him if his biography had
been “ghosted.” Apologetic, I asked how
it was selling. A shrug. “Quite well. It’s
not a best-seller. It’s a specialised sort
of book.”
Cool, distant and dead-pan, with
vestigial traces of a director’s authori-
tarianism, Josef Von Sternberg culti-
vates his own enigma. He refuses to
make himself vulnerable. Where Mar-
lene still stands in the spotlight and
receives applause, Sternberg is the sub-
ject of the retrospective season and the
thesis. He is 72 years old, his last film
was made 14 years ago, his creative
peak is 30 years behind him. What was
to emerge during our meeting
although not in his answers was that
he enjoys his fame but resents its basis,
We talked money. “Apart from Chap-
lin, no director owns his films,” he
said. There is real irony for Sternberg
when he reads of “Sternberg’s Blue
Angel.” He gets no income whatsoever
from revivals or TV sales. In some
cases, he had contractual arrangements
Joself Von Sternberg ... on the wrong foot
entitling him to a percentage, but with
rights sold and resold, who could he
sue? “It would need a never-ending
series of legal battles around the world.”
Soon he hoped a director would be
entitled to own at least a print of each
film, if not the original negative. “Some
of my films have disappeared com-
pletely. Lost. No, I don’t care. I
feel nothing for them.” He claimed that
once they were made, he lost all in-
terest. “A film is a search. Once it is
complete ...”
We talked about the Directors’ Guild,
of which he was a senior member. They
were now negotiating new terms with
the producers, setting higher minimums.
The dues to the guild are high “It’s
the most expensive trade union” and
provide funds to help members through
rainy days. As well, it pays good pen-
sions on retirement.
He warmed to the subject of his
varied interests. “I write, I paint, I
sculpt, I compose, I play very good
chess. I can strip a washing machine
and put it back together again. I can
fix a car.” He talked of his “huge
reference library,” adding that he’d had
“the largest art collection in the world.”
This sounded somewhat overstated on
reflection, so he added “possibly.”
I asked who were his favorite
directors, and he ticked off almost all
the big names, country by country.
Sternberg is only a controversialist
when it comes to his assessment of
actors. He’d mentioned Godard. Did
he really like him? “Certainly.” Even
“Alphaville” ? He confessed to a sneak-
ing disregard for that one, but the
others were very good indeed. Fellini,
Visconti they were all marvellous.
What about Satyajit Ray? “No, I don’t
like him at all.” Too slow? “Yes, and
he’s also amateurish.” I expressed
amazement; surely Ray was among the
most professional directors? As far as I
was concerned his films made Godard’s
look like bad home movies. “No. Ray
is amateurish and I dislike amateurism.”
In that case, what was his attitude
to the Underground Andy Warhol,
etc. “I like them because they like
film . . . but.” A quick expression of
distaste.
I’d hoped to talk politics, religion,
books with him, but he resisted any
change of subject. We got to politics
through his famous argument with
Theodore Drieser. Was it, in part,
caused by the author’s aversion to an
“uncommitted” director filming “An
American Tragedy?” “Possibly. In
part.”
“Are you scrupulously apolitic?”
“Yes, I am.”
“Have you no feelings or opinions
on, for instance, Vietnam?”
“No. Well, yes. They’re killing our


boys. We’re killing their boys. Why
don’t they stop? Then we will.”
“As simple as that?”
“Yes, as simple as that. I try to be a
good American. I believe that what my
Government does is right.”
He confessed to being “a socialist,
even an anarchist” in the ’twenties. “But
they were insincere. I was very poor—
terribly poor and they didn’t help
me.”
What did he read? “These questions
are not relevant.” I explained that his
attitude to Dietrich, actors, and film
was well known. His reading habits
might be interesting. “All right. I like
John Fowles. You do not know him?
He wrote ‘The Collector,’ which I
haven’t read. But his new novel!”
He steered us back on to films. He
agreed that Fellini was closer to his own
views and styles than most. He spoke
of the people who had credits in his
films and didn’t deserve them. “Dos
Passos, for instance, is credited with
writing one of my films. He didn’t. He
was in hospital.” Why the credit? “The
studio had these people on contract and
needed to give them work. So they’d
ask me and I’d agree. It wasn’t
important.”
It may not have been important
then, but it seemed important to him
now.
I left with the feeling that only a
little of bitterness was showing. Like a
good iceberg, the rest of it was out
of sight.
Sydney Film Festival
Sight and sanity
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
ONCE AGAIN a fortnight or so of
racing and chasing for dedicated fes-
tival subscribers in the always vain
effort to see everything that is showing.
Speaking for myself I learnt some years
ago that I hadn’t a hope of doing this
and keeping my sight and my sanity,
and have resigned myself to seeing as
many of the films as anyone reasonably
can—knowing by past experience that I
will undoubtedly miss something choice
and even more surely will be beguiled
by enthusiastic advance publicity into
wasting my time on duds.
John Frankenheimer’s “Seconds” has
been the most striking film seen so far,
though not my favorite of his movies;
the opening sequences and the ending
are brilliant, but the film sags in the
middle when Frankenheimer seems to
bog down in verbose explanation of his
thesis that flight from responsibility is
not as delightful in reality as in day-
dream, a point he has already made
implicitly. The film lacks the gripping,
laconic toughness of “The Manchurian
Candidate” or “Seven Days In May,”
but is still fascinating to watch; and the
director’s handling of Rock Hudson,
hardly one of the screen’s great actors,
goes a long way to prove the theory
that directors, not players, are the im-
portant people.
“Alphaville,” too, has its moments
of tedium when it tries to explain it-
self, but most of the time it is
a light-hearted, funny treatment of a
serious theme, a sort of knockabout ver-
sion of “Brave New World” or “1984.”
I’ve never been a Godard fan, but
found myself continually amused by this
flibbertigibbet film, in which the tough
private eye appears as the representative
of poetry, love, and non-conformism
and where the future isn’t represented
by gimmicky sets but by contemporary
glass and steel buildings photographed
with chilly precision.
The Russian “Shadows Of Forgotten
Ancestors,” described as avant - garde,
is probably the most arriere-garde film
ever, except for its original and
imaginative color photography. Torre
Nilsson’s “The Eavesdropper” is affected
and silly, full of heavy-handed and
irrelevant touches of the macabre
evidently in imitation of Bunuel, but
without any of his power to invest ex-
Eddie Constantine in Godard’s “Alpha-
ville” at Sydney Film Festival
traneous objects with menace. The
acting is unimpressive and given no
help by the monotonous dubbing; only
Buenos Aires itself, with its curious con-
trast of crumbling Spanish architecture
topped off with garish modernity, gives
the film some interest.
But even some pretty backgrounds
can’t do any good for “Dance Of The
Heron,” a Dutch film directed at
funereal pace and boasting a story that
even a true confession magazine would
reject. How did Gunnel Lindblom get
into this? And how on earth did this
get into a festival?
To judge by this festival, central
Europe is the busiest area of film pro-
duction. There is a most agreeable
double bill from Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria: “Intimate Lighting” is a
humorous, apparently slight and plot-
less account of a country weekend visit;
like a Chekhov story, it relies less on
events than on an almost imperceptible
revelation of character and the adjust-
ments we are all called upon to make
to life. It is diverting to watch, and
in retrospect keeps revealing deeper
implications. The Bulgarian “Knight
Without Armor” also deals with adjust-
ment here a small boy’s first inklings
that life and the grownups aren’t always
heroic and triumphant but occasion-
ally becomes too didactic in pointing
out what it has already implicitly stated
But it has considerable charm and in-
cludes one of the funniest portrayals of
a dreadful Sunday car drive that I’ve
ever seen.
“Long Live The Republic,” also from
Czechoslovakia, struck me as long-
winded and garbled; motivation of the
characters is obscure and there is an
irritating assumption that animals are
of necessity “nobler” than man
perhaps so, but since we’re stuck with
being human, let us worry about that
first. Hungary’s “The Round-up” i n .
dulges in no such dreams of noble
animals or nobility in general. This is
a harsh story> photographed in un-
compromising black-and-white which
finds a perverse beauty in the bleak
featureless plain, of a peasant revolu-
tion crushed with subtle, devious
brutality. The savage ending is the more
shocking because for a moment or two
you are lulled into believing that every-
thing may turn out all right.
Canada, which provided a very
pleasant surprise with “Nobody Waved
Goodbye” a couple of years ago, comes
good again with “Winter Kept Us
Warm,” a sensitive but also common-
sense study of the relationship between
two university students, one a shy,
dreamy freshman, the other a handsome,
successful senior. With deliberate under-
statement the film traces the growth
of their friendship, with the “big man
on campus” progressing from patron-
ising kindliness to a desperate and un-
Scene from Hungary’s “The Round-up.”
Definitely not a film about cowboys
requited love for the newcomer, who
moves away as he discovers new inter-
ests and friends. Not only a moving
story of an unhappy love but an im-
pressive statement of the fact that the
“sensitive soul” is generally as tough
as an old boot when it comes to the
point.
However, a sensitive man who is
genuinely thin-skinned turns up in the
Belgian film “The Man Who Had His
Hair Cut Short,” the story of a teacher
whose romatic love for a pretty student
develops from daydream to obsession.
It is well acted — 1 brilliantly by the
leading actor Senne Rouffaer —• h ut
directed in a plodding Teutonic fashion
which gave my mind too much time to

wander, I’m afraid; and the well-
nrings of the man’s madness and
despair were never clearly explained,
unlike those in “Le Feu Follet,” to
which this movie has been favorably,
)j Ut I think, unjustifiably compared.
The short films shown have been
a disappointment (unusual for the
festival, where these are often the
most rewarding offerings). The Com-
monwealth Film Unit’s “Workout,” a
beautiful unsentimental study of a man
and his horse, stays in the mind with
its pearly black-and-white photog-
raphy and its use of natural sound;
it gives a much more moving picture
of the dignity of an animal than the
Hungarian “Elegie,” which seemed to
me a hysterical harangue, so artily
photographed that it was to me almost
physically impossible to watch, not
because of the slaughterhouse scenes
but simply on account of the strain
imposed on the eyes by the jump-
cutting.
The rest have ranged from the mildly
entertaining to the earnest and
worthy, with one or two merely affected
and incomprehensible. There have
been some nicely drawn and diverting
cartoons (notably the Polish “Why Do
You Smile, Mona Lisa?”), but nothing
really memorable.
Film Festival, Melbourne
Mod world
By PHILLIP ADAMS
THE FILM-MAKERS’ vocabulary of
Mod is made up of the following ele-
ments: a camera with the subjective
life that comes from being hand-
held; a lens flaring as it turns into
lights or sun; quick cuts of other times
and other places interpolated into the
narrative; apparently candid, asym-
metric picture composition; the com-
pression of perspective as action is
followed on the telescopic end of the
zooming range, and the abrupt change
of emphasis with the long zoom in or
out; a screenful of out-of-focus fuzz,
except for a sharp fragment off-centre
in the frame; focus-pulling from one
extreme plane to another or no focus
at all, converting figures into looming
abstracts; dusty, grainy print quality;
exciting footage pared back to its
essence, while “nothing” footage like
heroine’s face at a window is held for
long, relentless minutes; emphasis on
chic props, like sunglasses, cigarettes,
and sports cars.
Sound? Devices include the removal
°f actuality sound-effects or dialogue
in favor of a triste ballad, or some-
thing wildly contrapuntal like a Japan-
ese counter-tenor; actual or simulated
extemporising of dialogue run over
otherwise meaningless footage, such as


an endless tracking shot down an empty
road.
All of which, appropriately employed,
can have great impact. The zoom lens,
for instance, is strangely appropriate
to the New Wave way of looking at
people. It studies them in close-up,
yet from a distance. It shares the
director’s interest and detachment, be-
ing ready to withdraw as soon as bore-
dom touches. Jump-cutting or skip-
ping through a scene can rid it of
its useless conjunctives. Intercutting of
brief “memory” material makes points
more powerfully, more quickly than
the laborious old flashback.
But when a director becomes obsessed
with his contemporary devices, you’ve
got troubles—or cigarette commercials.
Claude Lelouch’s “A Man and a
Woman,” shown at the Melbourne Fes-
tival, is a TV commercial run amok;
102 beautiful, modishly tinted minutes,
chic and empty, The Academy Award
winner for the best “Foreign Film” of
its year, recipient of the Catholic
Church’s main cinematic accolade, and
Grand Prix winner at Cannes, the film
could be cut up into little bits and sold
to ad agencies for gin, vodka, petrol,
and whathaveyou. The love story of
a racing driver and a film continuity
girl (professions chosen for their photo-
genic qualities?) might well have been
directed by Francois Craven-A or Peter
Stuyvesant.
The same vocabulary was employed
by Hugo Niebling in his color film
“Petrol.” A documentary on the oil
industry, it became a psychedelic
abstract as perhaps a thousand stun-
ning images were juxtaposed or blended
in just fourteen minutes. Commercial
TV’s legerdemain was at home here,
because the subject was a product, not
people.
“The Uprising” began its Festival
screening greatly disadvantaged. First,
it obviously had a very low Mod
quotient. Secondly, it was from
Rumania, the hillbilly end of Eastern
Europe. Thirdly, it was about a turn-
of-the-century peasant revolt, and hence
obviously propaganda.
But surprise, surprise. The film was
splendid. Politically it was subtle, its
form was inventive. The peasants were
not the noble creatures of Stalinist
sculpture, but a dull-eyed, brutish, sub-
servient lot, whose leadership was brave
but utterly inept. The aristocrats were
variously proud, decadent, or sensitive —
and even belatedly conscience-stricken.
And the revolution was ugly and des-
perate. The peasants wallowed in
feather-beds and stuffed their faces, tear-
ing books and smashing anything of
beauty. They were depicted as victims
of a social tragedy, not as heroes or
historic torchbearers.
The film’s best scene a memorable
achievement for editing and music
shows the peasants doing a folk-dance
in the slush of melting snow. The
revolution has yet to form in their
minds. All they have at this stage is
desperation and numbers. But this is
ostensibly a happy scene, and they
link arms and dance in concentric
circles. The camera watches their
cloth-bound feet pounding, and reels
with their spinning lines. The faces
smile, but the music becomes a threaten-
ing crescendo. Soon the folk-dance has
become an awesome vortex, and the
theatre is shaking and shaken.
The Canadian Film Board continues
to produce sensitive and responsible
films on its youth. “No Reason to Stay”
is a documentary which gives a high-
school drop-out’s point of view. We
see a high-school’s discipline, dullness
and foolishness through his eyes, in a
series of Billy Liar-type interludes. A
boy reads Dylan Thomas in class, and
is forced to join the rest in chanting
Walter De La Mare. The sexuality of
young people is ignored or outraged.
Education becomes a function of the
memory instead of the imagination.
Theatre
To a formula
By ROBERT WARD
Wolf’s Clothing. Kenneth Horne.
Pioneer Players, Adelaide.
KENNETH HORNE is a well-known
BBC comedy writer, and “Wolf’s
Clothing” displays the fact blandly and
slickly. The setting is a Whitehall
type’s summer house, the action is at
night and in the morning, and the
characters are concerned about which
husband slept with whose wife, which
wife with whose husband, and with
what happened to the maid. The plot
develops to the point where each
character is totally confused, and then
unwinds to a nice, neat ending. Humor
arises from the situation, but depends
on the quickly, neatly turned BBC
comic phrase for punch.
This production by the Pioneer
Players is a remarkably competent one.
In the past few years the group has
increased in confidence and expertise,
and in this play, under the direction of
Ann Christie, they perform at the right
pace, with the right tone, and altogether
the right lightheartedness.
There are excellent performances
from Sheila White as Janet Spicer, a
toothy post-deb with marriage problems,
and Tony Gilby as Julian Calvert, a
rather ineffectual junior official in
H.M. Overseas Service, but Jean Wray’s
Sally Calvert really holds the play and
cast together. She sets the pace and
maintains it, and gives a rounded per-
formance as a forthright, but slightly
dithering, housewife.
Only the set misses out. It is chean
and nasty, not at all the studied upp er .
middle English taste it should have
been.
Music
Beethoven cycle
By DAVID SALTER
Sydney String Quartet. Musica Viva
Beethoven Cycle. Conservatorium
Sydney.
IF THE NEAR capacity audience at
the Sydney Conservatorium for the
first of the six concerts the Sydney
String Quartet is giving to present the
Beethoven Cycle is any indication,
chamber music is as effective in
attracting Sydney audiences as are the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra subscrip,
tion series.
Harry Curby, Robert Ingram, Robert
Pikler, and John Painter are now a
very different Sydney String Quartet
from what they were last year. Their
decision to tackle the entire Beethoven
Quartet Cycle seems to have led them
away from their original traditional
approach and into a period of uncer-
tainty and experiment. To find and
realise something effective and
individual in each of the 18 quartets
is a task which has led the SSQ to a
markedly transitional phase in their
development.
There is an overall sense of tension
in their playing which has introduced
a roughness and approximate ensemble
not evident in their earlier perform-
ances. While the scope of the quartet’s
interpretative power is certainly broad-
ening, the sheer mechanics of playing
are being neglected.
Of the mannerisms, a repeated use
of the desolate, non vibrato device in
the quieter dramatic moments reached
aggravating proportions. While this
technique is extremely effective when
sparingly used, its continual appear-
ance tends to place it as an element
employed for its sound alone and not
always in a fully justifiable context.
Much the same can be said of the
Quartet’s choice of bowing styles. The
variations were a little obvious and
studied, the resultant textures stuffy
and predictable. Once again the tension
of the playing forced a rushing which
obscured many of the music’s subtler
moments.
Much of the performance was, how-
ever, free from these troubles. As the
evening progressed the playing gradu-
ally improved to a point where, despite
a disastrous Andante opening, Op. 59
No. 3 emerged as an entirely memor-
able performance. The strangely dis-
tant anguish of the slow movement
was wonderfully handled and the
Quartet attacked the Allegro finale’s
fugue with stirring richness and vigor.

Art
Man as outcast
By ELWYN LYNN
Oliffe Richmond. Australian Sculpture
Centre, Canberra.
Michael Kitching. Hungry Horse Gal-
lery, Sydney.
THE AUSTRALIAN SCULPTURE
CENTRE celebrates its first birthday
with a show of sculpture, drawings, and
lithographs by Oliffe Richmond, who
has lived in London since he arrived
there on a New South Wales Travelling
Scholarship in 1948. The show, his
first in Australia and later for Mel-
bourne’s Tolarno, is powerfully evoc-
ative of the beleaguered and undaunted
spirit of man, bruised, bound, blinded,
emerging like a swamp-enshrouded hulk,
hardly liberated and still resisting the
immense pressures about him. The
surfaces are kneaded and gouged a
little like Rodin’s but he has none of
that sculptor’s optimism; for Richmond,
as for Germaine Richier, the early
Paolozzi, and Elizabeth Frink, man is a
maimed creature. In an age turning to
joyously colored sculpture and minimal
forms Richmond’s man looks like a
defiant, derelict outcast.
His bronze men bear the weight of
the world and space; only between
spindly or trunk-like legs does space
flow freely in the manner of Moore,
with whom Richmond studied in 1949-
50. Before Moore, sculpture was mainly
of two kinds: that where space weighs
on the forms and confined expanding
forces and that where space yields to
embracing and projected forms. Moore
created a unique sculpture from the
contrapuntal shapes of protruberances
that invaded space and solid shapes
holed to invite the invasion of space.
His achievement was to balance these
antagonistic movements in a consis-
tent whole. Since Moore, minimal
structuralists casually place on the
floor boxes, tubes, cylinders, and tri-
angular prisms which confine few pres-
sures and exert none; they just occupy
space. What Kitching is doing is quite
another matter; he allows light to flow
through fluorescent perspex boxes or to
originate inside them from jewel-like
or pearly globes. The sculpture is not
lit; it looks like congealed light, and one
is aware more of transparency than
translucency, for you can see what the
other side is like.
Richmond is in the tradition of walk-
around sculpture: “Hostage” is a bound
figure where the overall sensuousness is
a foil to the grim message; “Japanese
Actor” is a slab on one side and a tiny
head emerging from pellets of surging
bronze on the other; from any view-
point “Tumbler” sends up a beseeching
arm, and one follows the bandage*
around “Blindfold Head” as they be-
come flesh itself. “Defender II,” a piece
of unrelieved aggression, and “Minos”
a lurching lump of power on stocky
legs, present all-round defiance, but the
tall “Sentinel” to go to the Art Gallery
of N.S.W. stands with huddled, feature-
less head and arms shrunken into its
body a sentinel over a world he did
not make.
At the champagne opening, j ust
across from the “Sentinel’s” weathered
spindly shanks, were a pair of live
Twiggy legs, above which glowed an
orange twosome (suit, to Richmond’s
generation), and at once we are in the
world of Kitching, a radiant, optimistic
one, discreetly lit like an intimate night-
club, joyous without being ecstatic,
bathed in a perpetual, beneficient glow.
A little more amber light and his ex-
citing show of constructions would
induce the feeling of the first two
whiskies. Richmond might agree with
Magritte’s saying, “I am repatriated by
a moment of panic,” but if he returned
to Australia and visited New Zealand
he would find cool sculptors like Kitch-
ing, who believe, with Brancusi, that
“Art is not a brainstorm.”
There was a time when painting was
for Kitching a flurry of overripe color
or glowing stained-glass windows; these
he forsook for sullied armament plaques
that came by way of Burri and Stankie-
wicz. The plaques became shinier,
cleaner, began to wear sashes of red
and white, and finally stepped off the
wall to become free-standing sculpture,
but remained paintings in the round;
one was not then, or now, driven
around them by expectancy as with
Richmond or Moore.
These new, warm, unexcited works
mirror not so much the Space Age as
the prevailing view of youth that there
are no mysteries and almost everything
can be seen through. “Thoton’s” large
globe, in a box of fluorescent crimson
perspex, casts a benign rhdiance;
“Chicago 42” with its two parallel discs
of perspex lit with orange globes is a
glowing, celebratory totem of the
plastic era, but “Blue Quado,” with four
red lights in velvety blue, casts lam-
bent reflections. Most satisfying are the
simplest lit and unlit wall plaques
of silver hemisphere under a sheet of
crimson perspex smooth, uncontrived
and immediate, rather facile, but at
home in this skilfully constructed and
sophisticated toyland with its sugges-
tions of science-fiction and faint hints
of lethal weaponry.
Who would have imagined a few
years ago that Australian sculpture
could be as lit up as that of Ameri-
cans like Chryssa, Flavin, or Howard
Jones or that Melbourne’s Asher Bilu
could be devising an electronic piece
that reacts with lights and noises to
your presence? Not Richmonds
“Sentinel,” who makes tough demands
upon the imagination.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
On being friendly with the U.S.
AUSTRALIA IS AT a serious disadvantage in its relations
w ith the United States. We are a friendly ally, so we get
badly treated. If only we had been a defeated enemy, then
the sense of moral responsibility that enables the U.S. to
exempt Japan from its overseas borrowing restraints would
possibly have spread the exemption to Australia, too. We
might have got our fair share of supply contracts to U.S.
forces in Vietnam instead of the present paltry gesture. And
we could even have stood a chance of getting some worth-
while concessions out of the bilateral tariff talks with the
U.S. that have emerged out of the Kennedy Round.
Maybe Mr. Holt didn’t show it quite as bluntly to Presi-
dent Johnson last week as Mr. McMahon did to the American
Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne on Friday, but the
Australian Government is making no bones about its deter-
mination to get economic and financial arrangements with
the U.S. on a basis more appropriate to the high level of
our togetherness in other key fields. To be precise, considering
only our dual involvement in Vietnam and our massive
(about $4OO million this year) rapidly growing current
account deficit with the U.S., it is quite absurd that we
shouldn’t be on all fours with Japan and Canada in being
exempted from the interest equalisation tax now applicable
to Australian borrowing in the United States. At the very
least we shouldn’t he obliged to repay Government loans to
the U.S. to conform with the Administration’s impediments,
whether they be bans on the export of U.S. capital or simply
prohibitive charges added to borrowing rates by the equalisa-
tion tax. The tax is soon to be increased to as much as two
percent, putting up the cost of refinancing loans in the U.S.
market to more than seven percent. It was certainly right
for the Treasurer to spell that out and to add for good
measure that we continue to be hit by the 25 cents a lb.
import duty on wool, beef, and butter quotas and the
generally unreceptive climate for our exports to the U.S.
The Treasurer didn’t mention that he is currently scratch-
ing around in the Euro-dollar market for a paltry S23J
million to compensate in part for our borrowing absence in
Wall Street. All he said was that the Government has been
obliged by U.S. parsimony toward us, and a similar unfavor-
able borrowing climate in Britain, to repatriate $9O million
worth of loans this financial year at the price of eating into
our international reserves, which are under pressure for other
reasons anyway. In such circumstances, Mr. McMahon is
probably right to shine the other face of the coin on U.S.
faces that is, the tightening of local borrowing facilities
for American operations in this country and to couple this

MEN AND MATTERS
THERE has probably never been such
an impressive collection of businessmen
added to the list of Australian knights
in one go as in last weekend’s Birthday
Honor’s list. John Cadwallader, Norman
Cowper, George Fisher, James Forrest,
Laurie Hartnett, Frank McDowell, C.
0. Turner, Bill Walkley, and Captain
J. P. Williams are nine men who have
done very well indeed in business
and all but one, Frank McDowell, are
the new breed of professional managers
who sit on the boards of companies
whose capital they don’t own or control.
And the large proportion of profes-
sional men in this list of nine (two
accountants, two lawyers, and two
engineers) gives a pretty realistic indi-
cation of the sort of people who are
becoming successful business leaders
these days.
The honors lists in Sir Robert
day were never so heavily
larded with businessmen. But after
many years as Treasurer, Mr. Holt no
doubt has a different view of their
contribution to society than Sir Robert.
Bill Walkley is a bit of a ring-in on
an Australian list, even though he is,
a * 70, the “father” of the Australian
oil search industry. For he really is a
Zealander who came to Australia
years ago as an accountant member
°f a syndicate of New Zealanders plan-
ning to make their fortunes by creating
an independent oil company. That com-
pany is now Ampol and New Zea-
land shareholdings are probably no
more than five percent now as it has
become a truly Australian operation.
Walkley played a major role in get-
ting rid of petrol rationing after the
1949 elections, when he convinced Sir
Arthur Fadden that it should be a
plank in the Country Party platform.
But with Sir Robert Menzies having
been close to Shell at the time, Walkley
was busy twisting its tail when setting
Ampol up in 1936, so the coalition
didn’t ever get around to saying “thank
you” in very tangible terms.
THERE ARE TWO “institutions” at
the annual report award dinner of the
Australian Institute of Management;
one of them is Larke Consolidated
Industries getting the first prize (it did
so for the fourth time in a row last
week) and the other is the adjudica-
tor’s report of Stan Owens, the AlM’s
senior vice-president and father of the
whole idea of an annual report award.
An accountant who is trying to break
down the public reticence of other
accountants, E. S. Owens, believes that
the annual report is a natural communi-
cations medium that must be used by
private enterprise to tell its own story
or someone else will tell it, perhaps
not accurately. Stan Owens did his
E. S. Owens
Sir IF. Walkley
articles with Hungerford Spooner (his
son is currently doing likewise with
Price Waterhouse), but he is now
principal of the chartered accountancy
practice he established in 1956. And he
is one of those accountants who sees his
role as well and truly in the company
management field, being chairman of
Stott and Underwood and Associated
Minerals, and on the board of Jaywoth
Industries, STC, and Helena Rubin-
stein.
A proud citizen of Sydney (he enjoys
the view from the 13th floor of Gold-
fields House and a home at Pymble),
Mr. Owens is president of Civic Reform.
He believes Sydney tends to squander
its natural facilities and lacks the
atmosphere and spirit which Mel-
burnians have created.


with a prod to let Australians participate more liberally
in their businesses. But wouldn’t it have been far better, even
if it meant saying we won’t be so insistent on their forgoing
more equity, to have suggested doing a deal with the U.S.
on the basis that, if they exempted our Government bor-
rowing in the U.S. from the equalisation tax, we would
not be so strict as present guidelines demand on the borrow-
ing of capital here by U.S. corporations (in fact, we’ve been
pretty gentle with them, as IBM and Ford can show). Quite
irrespective of what we may think they owe us for being
so faithful to their international causes, surely there’s room
for horse-trading along these lines.
For Chinese checkers
OUR COPY OF the Bulletin of Overseas Investment for
1965-66 has its text upside down and it reads backwards,
starting from page 52, with the appendices moving toward the
introduction and contents at the end. Now, we know the
Bureau of Census and Statistics has a great rush getting out
statistics for the financial year ending only 11J months
ago, and are sure it is no conspiracy to cloud this contro-
versial political issue. So, adapting ourselves to a Chinese
reading posture and steeling ourselves with oriental stoicism,
we attempted to draw some conclusions from this original
document.
The first conclusion is that the trend toward great Ameri-
can investment in Australia continued strongly through last
year. Despite the U.S. Government’s discouragement of
capital outflow, U.S. money coming to Australia increased
from $267 million to $327 million. British investment was
constant around the $2OO million figure, but “other country”
investment jumped spectacularly from $63 million to $97
million. This obviously includes a lot of Japanese investment
and the Statistician will soon have to recognise that Japan
is not just “another country.” The estimated total value of
accumulated investment by British companies in Australia
still exceeds that of American companies, $2641 million to
$lBB9 million.
A striking feature of last year’s foreign investment by
industry is the fall in the amount of money going into
manufacturing, from $252 million to $173 million, the lowest
level since 1961. The total only went up because of sharp
rises in investment in minerals and oil search and, inter-
estingly, into agriculture as well. From 1955 until 1964
foreign investment in agriculture ranged between $lO million
and $3O million a year, with no trend either up or down.
On the past two years it has climbed to over $lOO million
confirmation of the element of fact in Mr. McEwen’s claim
that we are “selling a bit of the farm each year!”
The decline in manufacturing investment is rather alarm-
ing, because manufacturing is one of the main sources of
growth in the economy and continued investment in this
sector is vital to continued expansion of capacity and the
introduction of new technology. The extent of the fall in
particular sectors of manufacturing is astonishing. In “found-
ing, engineering, and metal working,” investment was down
from $43 million to $l7 million, and in “vehicles, parts, and
accessories” from $64 million to $2O million. The latter,
incidentally, is a sad reflection on the Department of Trade
and Industry’s scheme for the encouraging investment in
the Australian motor industry to increase Australian content.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : The Arbitration Commission
announced “the elimination of basic wages and margins
and the introduction of total wages”; it then gave a rise
of $1 a week “to the weekly award wages of all adult
males and females.”
Eleven months’ overseas trade figures, to May, threw
down a $1.7 million deficit on current account, to con-
trast with the corresponding 1966 position of a $248
million deficit. May’s exports, at $287.1 million (April,
$273.4 million), brought the 11 months’ level to $2782.4
million, while imports (May, $265.2 million) totalled
$2784.1 million.
Foreign investment in Australian companies went up
by $lOO million to $664 million in 1965-66; $327 million
came from America and Canada, $217 million from
Britain.
For the markets : The Middle East war helped
to keep Australian share markets uncertain, but BHP
brought them relief and new heart on Thursday and
Friday. Good industrials steadied, while a variety of
metals'went ahead once more.
On fairly small volumes, London also held reasonably
firm, with interest among second-line industrials . . .
Wall Street continued to go ahead despite the political
news; glamor stocks remain under pressure.
For companies: BHP-Esso’s offshore Kingfish
A-l gave sparkle to the week by an oil flow at a rate
of some 1500 barrels a day; characteristically, the report
mentioned that the well’s significance awaits “additional
drilling and evaluation” . . . Off Victoria’s west coast,
in the Otway Basin, Shell Development’s Pecten No. 1A
yielded a small gas flow on its first test; Shell is soon
to drill, on Frome Broken Hill permits, offshore from
Anglesea (60 miles from Melbourne) . . . Union-Kern-
AOG’s Moonie field will have four more development
wells, adding to about 30 now producing . . . The
Associated Oil group has more gas at Roma, in Wallum-
billa South No. 1.
The metals seemed less obtrusive than usual ... To
keep their end up, however, the Papua-New Guinea
Administration will approve the development of CRA-
New Broken Hill’s Bougainville deposits of copper and
gold, and has its eyes glued to the tax yield . . . Great
Boulder can’t find any historical records of nickel at
Mt. Martin (W.A.).
Simplicity went by the board when Litton Industries
concocted its bid for Business Equipment Holdings,
whose directors apparently understand and recommend
the combined cash and participating preference stock
offer . . . Pioneer Industries, in formal rejection of
H. K. Porter Co. Inc.’s bid, predict “considerable im-
provement” in 1967-68 . . . G. K. N. International’s
attempt to take over Brown and Bureau lapsed on in-
sufficient acceptances . . . Veteran and diverse Mauri
Bros, and Thomson is offering about $1.34 million cash
for butchers’ supplier Colbro Holdings.
The week’s more orthodox results were cheerfully
dominated by ICIANZ’s 16.8 percent lift, to $3,865,000,
for the half-year to March; higher sales and new plant
did the trick, together with some assistance from the
tariff . . . More like its old self, Commonwealth Indus-
trial Gases shot up 31.6 percent in its six months to
April, profits reaching $1,353,000 on ten percent better
sales . . . With the strength also, Metal Manufactures
moved from $3,573,202 to $4,787,701 in 1966, assisted by
the higher domestic copper price; the group is embarking
upon “substantial” capital expansion . . . Paint-maker
Taubmans held sales and profits in the March half-year.
We all knew profits of Perth’s Swan Brewery were
going to be higher: they went up a mere 19 percent
for 1966-67 (the year to March from $2,117,756 to
$2,506,768), giving a 22.9 percent earning rate . . . On
the solid side, grocer Permewan Wright did well in its
second half, so earnings slipped only 5.7 percent to
$1,095,944; sales put on $7 million to touch $72 million.
It’s four times in a row for motor dealer and engineer
Larke Consolidated, which again won the AlM’s award
for the best annual report.


Has
medical science
found the
answer to the
discomfort of the
sore throat?
A unique anti-bacterial throat medica-
tion has been developed . . . acclaimed
as one of the most effective oral treat-
ments of throat infection so far dis-
covered. BAYER GERMANY named
this treatment luersal. Since its release,
luersal has gained wide professional
recognition and acceptance and has
been freely prescribed for the past six
years in Australia. Iversal, the anti-
bacterial throat lozenge, contains a
powerful active ingredient Ambazone.
It arrests the growth of haemolytic
streptococci, most commonly the cause
of throat infections.
A sore throat is the result of bacterial
invasion of the mucous membranes
which become aggravated and inflamed.
An luersal lozenge, sucked slowly, does
more than soothe away throat soreness
and relieve painful swallowing, it strikes
deep at the core of the infection.
luersal effectively fights the hurtful
bacteria, accelerates healing, provides
protection against renewed infection.
Yet luersal does not contain a local
anaesthetic; it actually treats the source
of the infection.
f'or positive relief from the discomfort
of a sore throat you need pleasant-
tasting luersal. quite safe for the whole
family. Your chemist will he pleased to

CROESUS TOUCH
A pronouncement
about all
those total wages
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IT WASN’T SO much the adoption
of the total wage which surprised me
in last week’s wages decision, nor the
ten-bob increase in what we must now
call (in the plural, it seems) all those
total wages. It was .more the women
being let in the back door for equal
pay, with all the implications of that
for industrial costs. It was also the
easy assurance with which the Arbi-
tration Commission passed the major
buck of the contentious margins issue
to Commissioner Winter’s work value
studies and put him on them full-
time. Despite their present protesta-
tions, this would seem to open up a
most promising source of wages
increases for the unions.
Not least of the features of the
decision was its apparent unanimity,
which meant the absence of long-
winded separate judgments which have
made so many people so dizzy so often
over the years. Another relieving
feature was that, as well as wiping
out double counting of productivity
gains in fixing award wages, the Com-
missioners appear to have rejected the
employers’ notion of automatic pro-
ductivity adjustments. Their future
intention is to take everything thrown
up to them into account, even price
movements, which is as it should be.
Sir Richard Kirby breaks new
ground in calling his final document
°n the case a “pronouncement” instead
°f a judgment. This belatedly recog-
nises that the august body over which
he presides ceased to be a court years
a go. Also, even if I find it particu-
larly rich, his unequivocal statement
0n the Commission’s attitude to the
possible economic effects of its deci-
sions is a milestone. After saying the
economy could absorb the increases
without hurt, the better so it would
be the last for at least a year, the
president emphasied that the Commis-
sion’s consideration of likely economic
consequences “is consistent with the
attitude we have always adopted in
the past, namely to consider the eco-
nomic consequences of our decisions,
but not to attempt to create an eco-
nomic climate.” That is surely the
most controversial statement of the
year. In the past the Commission
has never had to try to create an
economic climate by making its deci-
sion this way or that, but it has usually
succeeded in doing so all the same.
What is more, I’m not at all sure that
this particular $1 increase, when
coupled with the other two increases in
the past year which increased wages by
seven percent, won’t also have a dis-
cernible effect on the economic climate.
It was precisely the danger of a
third increase in award wages within
the last 12 months having an
adverse influence on the economic
climate that the Commonwealth’s sub-
mission at this year’s hearings was all
about. The Commonwealth takes an
objective view, and so do the Commis-
sioners. The difference between them
is that the Commonwealth’s submission
is arrived at by some of the best
economic brains we have and they make
allowances for lively contingencies
(even a war in the Middle East, per-
haps). On the other hand, nobody, even
themselves, would ever consider the
Commissioners to be economic experts
taking long views of possible con-
tingencies.
Yet this time, as often in the past,
the Commission says it has weighed the
arguments on economic issues put before
it by the Commonwealth and has found
them wanting. It then proceeds to
enumerate its own views of the econ-
omic position. Contrary to what both
the Commonwealth and employers said
to it, it concludes “on the evidence
available there is no ground for fear-
ing that the July and December wage
increases caused any damage to the
economy” and that “the proposed in-
crease is within the capacity of the
economy expanding as it is at present.”
How many economists would agree with
these two propositions? Not all that
many, perhaps.
If the Commission was obliged to
accept the objective views of expert
economists, it would best serve the
purposes of wage fixing if economists
and not legal people were in a majority
on it. Why not! The idea that it
exists to settle interstate industrial dis-
putes wears very thin, anyway, if, in
fact, it has ever been a realistic des-
cription of its national wage case hear-
ings. By adopting the total wage con-
cept and by removing the fixing of
margins to expert studies of work
values, it has now arrived at the logical
stages of rationalisation in its methods
of determining award wages.
As it is, the Commission is still
plodding along in the same old groove

Are you combing the prosperous Newcastle/Hunter Valley market
thoroughly?
It’s a vital market, Australia’s 6th largest —big, prosperous and
growing. Bigger than the state of Tasmania —a population of
410,000, and much more concentrated.
For the local traders it’s a market that adds up to retail sales
of $3OO million a year.
It's a big city, big market, demanding big city services and

in considering economic implications
and, it has to be said, neither employ,
ers nor unions have been encouraging
it as much as they should to get out
of it. The general level of economic
sophistication around its wage hear-
ings is still not much higher than it
was 20 years ago. Furthermore, com-
ment from industry, unions, and the
Press on its decisions has changed very
little over the years. This year the
advent of the total wage has provided
new angles, of course, but by and large
we have had the same old responses
from industry and the unions on the
consequences arising for costs, prices
and industrial relations, and little else.
Not a word about the implications for
credit policy.
Doubtless in a context of expand-
ing economic activity the authorities
have taken into account that demands
on bank accommodation for working
capital to finance higher wages bills
would increase as the year went on.
But it has recently seemed to me
that, in allowing the trading banks
to grant new overdraft limits and in-
crease advances so freely, the Reserve
Bank was storing up trouble for itself
in the event of another wage increase
being made at this time. It seems as
if the Reserve Bank has been allow-
ing the trading banks actually to
force the pace of economic activity,
not merely to help sustain it by per-
forming their traditional compen-
sating role in offsetting the usual
drain on the system’s liquidity occa-
sioned by Treasury operations in the
June quarter and in face of a con-
tinuing decline in international reserves.
Unfortunately the May figures for
bank advances and their liquidity ratios
were not available for this article, but
the April increase of $123.7 million in
advances, which brought them to more
than $3OOO million for the first time
and put them nearly $3OO million above
the end of April last year, gives a
measure of what has been going on.
So do the latest figures for new over-
draft limits, which take us up to May
10. In the four-week period to that date,
new overdraft lending limits increased
by $32 million a week, which is about a
third more than a year earlier. Term
loan lending approvals have increased
even faster, from $1 million a week a
year ago to an average of $3.2 million
in the latest four-week period. Again,
the trading banks’ farm-lending ap-
provals have risen from $1 million a
week last May to an average of $7 mil-
lion a week this one.
I give these recent figures for bank
lending neither to damn nor praise, but
simply to show that the expansion of
credit has already gone pretty far, and
that the trading banks may find it
awkward to meet demands for accom-
modation arising from the effects of the
wages decision on industry’s working
capital requirements.

The next iron ore venture
Cliffs on the move with
larger operation
AUSTRALIA’S NEXT iron ore min-
ing venture is not only getting closer
it also looks like getting bigger than
originally planned. Western Australia’s
Cliffs group is currently negotiating a
significant increase in the size oh its
iron ore operation. The tightly kept
secret leaked out through two of the
four Japanese trade newspapers, was
half-heartedly denied by the Industrial
Development Minister, Mr. Charles
Court, but is likely to be confirmed
soon.
Since BHP quit the planned cost-
sharing partnership with Cliffs Western
Australian Mining Co., doubts have
been expressed about the group’s ability
to go it alone. The new scheme will
come as a surprise to those who con-
sidered Cliffs an unlikely starter.
So far, Cliffs have a firm contract
to supply 71.4 million tons of pellets
to the Japanese steel mills at 19.1
U.S. cents per Fe unit, f.0.b., the highest
price any of the iron groups has man-
aged to retain. The outlet for this
Garrick Agnew
Lang Hancock
contract, and the one agreed to with
the Western Australian Government, was
Cape Preston, 70 miles from the com-
pany’s limonite deposits along the Robe
River.
Two decisions are yet to be made and
agreed to between buyer and seller,
ratified by the State Government and
perhaps the Federal Government. The
first would dictate the process to be
used, and this in turn would largely
decide which of the tenderers Allis
Chalmers, Dravo, or McKee should
win the contract to build the pellet
plants.
The second decision concerns the
port. One of the Japanese trade papers
claimed Cliffs had definitely decided
to move to Cape Lambert the port
Hamersley’s prospector Mr. Lang Han-
cock sees as terminal of his Fortescue
Valley line, taking out asbestos and
toanganese, as well as iron. Mr. Court
has refuted this claim and says economic
and engineering studies of the two ports
are continuing, although he adds that
the State Government encouraged Cliffs
in their study of Cape Preston. This
port, 107 miles from the mine, would
cost at least $lO million more to
develop. But it has the advantage of
being able to accommodate 100,000-
tonners with little or no dredging, and
150,000-tonners with further dredging.
Whether or not the Japanese want this
will depend on whether or not they
are seeking the kind of super-carriers
that Port Hedland has been criticised
for being unable to accommodate.
The position of Lang Hancock in
this is obscure. Although it was he who
first announced plans for Cape Lam-
bert and he will be on the ground
floor with control of some key installa-
tions he can expect no official credit
for paving the way for a new scheme.
Expansion for Cliffs would boost
their capitalisation from $l3O million
to about $lBO million, close to the level
for Mt. Newman. Annual throughput
would move up from the original 3.6
million to 4.5 million tons of pellets
annually, starting in 1970, two years
later than originally planned.
The group’s parent company, Cleve-
land Cliffs Iron Co., of Ohio, holding
51 percent of the equity, is a conser-
vative organisation and a commitment
to increase the size of the operation,
if necessary, is the result of long and
careful planning. The other partners
are Mitsui (35 percent) and the com-
pany owned by Garrick Agnew, who
prospected the area and brought in his
partners. He holds percent, leaving
6| percent yet to be allocated. The
Bulletin forecast on April 22 that this
Australian 14 percent would be grouped,
and an Australian public company
would be formed to take it up.
The key point of the continuing
negotiations in Japan will, be price.
Cliffs’ contract price is considerably
above the Federal guideline level, and
increased throughput would improve
the operation’s economics. Cliffs and
the Western Australian Government
want the move to Cape Preston and the
bigger operation this would entail. And
although the price has been held
through some precarious times, it is
unlikely that such a high level could
be maintained in the new round of
bargaining, particularly in view of the
contracts with Australian and other
pellet suppliers the Japanese have writ-
ten since the Cliffs contract of 1964.
But while things are looking brighter
for the Cliffs group, the question of
the adequacy of Port Hedland as an
outlet for the rival Mt. Newman iron
ore consortium in the pattern of world

trade now emerging, has been raised
again by the recent Japanese decision
to buy pellets from Marcona in South
America. Marcona will be selling from
the east coast of South America at
prices below the Hamersley price-level,
the guideline price set by the Com-
monwealth. One of the reasons they
can do this is the fact that they will,
jn 1970 when the eight-year contract
becomes operable, be selling in 125,000-
tonners, carriers that can convert to
handle either bulk ores or oil.
Port Hedland is being developed in
the near future to handle 68,000-
tonners, in the long term to take
100,000-tonners but at tremendous
cost. And, meanwhile, its landlocked
situation, fed by an extremely narrow
channel, makes it vulnerable to the
whims of the weather in this cyclone-
belt area. Mt. Newman have yet
adequately to explain their insistence
on using Port Hedland as an outlet.
IN THE BACKING and filling that
preceded the signing of the Mt. New-
man iron ore agreement, much was
said in an impersonal way about Port
Hedland. It was widely criticised as
inadequate for the tonnages it would
have to handle, handicapped as it is by
shallow water, dangerous shoals up to
20 miles out to sea, and a channel so
narrow that one bulk carrier caught
side-on could choke it.
But the deal was signed, and now
the sleeply little town, ringed by mud-
flats and mangrove swamps, is to be-
come a big and busy town. It will
handle 30 million tons of cargo a year
by 1980, one-third the throughput of
the Port of London. And while the
main problem in the town at present is
the iron-dust that drifts across the har-
bor and settles on the beer, it is clear
that the $BO million convulsion of
activity over the next few months will
transform not only the physical ap-
pearance of the town but will mould
the attitudes that make it tick.
The population is expected to double
within four years to 4000—the perma-
nent population swollen by 800 workers
on the Mt. Newman project and
to reach 12,000 by 1980. Although 200
acres of swampland have been re-
claimed with the mud dredged from the
bottom of the harbor, the existing town,
reached by a causeway, is inadequate.
So a new town site is planned inland,
separated from the harbor area by
sporting grounds and industrial sites.
Mt. Newman will put up $1.3 million
of the $l.B million needed to tap under-
ground water supplies from 38 miles
west at Yule River; the Leslie Salt Co.,
which is developing solar salt works
nearby ) will contribute nearly all the
$1.6 million needed for a new all-
purpose wharf. Already Goldsworthy
have put in $200,000 for improved
water facilities, another $200,000 for
school accommodation.

You need more than a driver's licence
to be a Remington technician
No joke. It needs three years training and regular re-
fresher courses. Only then is a Remington technician
allowed even near a customer's machines.
Pretty solid, you might say. But it pays off. The Reming-
ton trainee school turns out the most highly trained team
of office equipment experts in the country.
One particular thing Remington men learn is that a
client hates to be kept waiting in an emergency. That's
why they've built a reputation for being the fastest
qualified experts of this type, on the scene anywhere.
And we mean anywhere ! Remington's service team
has offices in 94 cities and towns throughout Australia.
When you've got more machines throughout the country
than anyone, you need the largest team to service them!
A Remington technician certainly goes through a lot
before he's sent out on the road. But it means that
Remington's clients can forget about service worries. -

Plenty of oils at quick call
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
APART FROM BHP (our favorite oil
stock), Ampol Exploration, and Wood-
side, the oil market is not nearly as
bright as it deserves to be in the context
or more and more discoveries of oil
and gas, and the extent of the continu-
ing search. The highly successful King-
fish well of BHP-Esso gives a massive
upgrading to the potential of Australia’s
offshore search as does the Ampol
success on Pasco Island. Last week’s
news from Kingfish of an excellent oil
flow suggests it could be on a field as
big as the neighboring Marlin one,
which is guesstimated at 500 million
barrels. (Barrow Island, Australia’s
biggest producing field, has reserves of
100 million barrel^.)
The relatively low level of oil share
prices is largely because the market
knows damn well that whenever it be-
comes interested in a situation, the
searching company makes a call on its
contributing shares. The Queensland
oil index slumped 7 percent a fortnight
ago before recovering some of the way
last week; it seemed more than a
coincidence that four companies an-
nounced calls ranging from 5 to 10
cents a share.
In an industry where there is a
serious tendency for foreign companies
to dominate the search because of the
weight of capital they can mobilise, it
seems absurd that the Government
should not give a greater taxation con-
cession than the one-third deduction on
calls. If this were raised to a two-thirds
or even 100 percent deduction, but
only for local taxpayers, then this
would be a powerful incentive for the
search.
The Associated Group have an in-
teresting look about them at present,
and t h e jq percent call (due on June
14) that contributing shareholders were
recentl clobbered with has not
~.. . . ,
diminished market interest too much.
The oil at Duarran and the h
additions to at Wallumbilla (both
„• N , .
near Roma in Queensland) have given
t^ie Associated Group their biggest boost
for some time. It was oil in the Duarran
No. 2 hole that really pushed them
along a few weeks ago. After the Wal-
lumbilla gas producer (which has come
in with 50 barrels a day of 61-degree
condensate, as well as adding 127,000
million cubic feet of gas to Associated’s
Roma gas field) has been completed,
the rig is to drill another Duarran hole
as a step-out from No. 2. This No. 2
well has been cased as an oil producer
after flowing more than 1000 barrels
a day.
According to the Quentin Cameron
publication, “Exploration News and
Views,” there is a growing feeling that
Duarran will not lead to another oil
field of Moonie’s proportions, although
it would still be commercial if the step-
out wells show results. Even if the field
is not big enough to warrant a 90-mile
pipeline to join the Moonie-Brisbane
one, it could make trucking of oil to
Moonie a worthwhile proposition, with
a profit estimate of about $1 a barrel.
But gas is a far more certain profit
proposition for Associated, which has
already contracted to sell 100,000 mil-
lion cubic feet through the Roma-
Brisbane pipeline. In addition, Associ-
ated has a stake in the Rarako Creek
well being drilled in its area in New
Guinea.
Exoil is a fairly cheap way into the
oil business, with its shares at around
15 cents, providing a stake in the
Mereenie area. Exoil has 21 percent of
this, Magellan has 50 percent, Transoil
9 percent, and Farmout percent.
Small amounts of oil have been re-
covered here in the East Mereenie No.
4 well (plenty of gas has been found
in the vicinity, but it is away in the
wilderness of the Northern Territory,
west of Alice Springs, so its uses could
be limited). The Cameron digest says
that investors should not feel too
pessimistic about the slow flow of oil
at Mereenie, as it believes the porosity
of the section tested was good, but the
permeability was poor and that
while porosity cannot be created, per-
meability can. So a “significant oil flow
from this column is still possible.”
Woodside, with its areas next to the
BHP-Esso offshore strikes, has held up
very well indeed (as well it should) in
the face of this week’s call. The
Woodside-Burmah Oil Golden .Beach
well last week reached 5700 feet of the
10,000 feet target the drillers plan to
reach before testing the gas indications
noted a month ago at around the 2100-
The Chartist says:
NORTH BROKEN HILL is a stock in an interesting technical situation, with
prospects of further capital gains. A downtrend was followed until the end of
1962, when a reversal of trend at a rate of over 100 percent appreciation per
annum ultimately took prices to a high of $4.60 in July, 1964, although by
this time the stock was moving sideways after the break in the steep intermediate
trend early 1964. Prices subsequently fell to $3.20, where consolidation took
place above this level in a neutral trend. The stock has been able to resist
the downward trend of the LME metal prices and the market action over
recent months and the rise to $4.80 suggests that a new upward movement could
eventually take prices to approximately $6.40. However, the situation would call
for reassessment should prices fall below $4.00 in the short term. Last sale
price on 6/6/67 $4.50.


successful fund-raising
methods outlined ....
5 STATE SEMINARS, JULY, 19 67
Today, more than ever before, charities, churches and clubs have a
need to know and apply the most advanced principles of 'big-money'
fund raising. Unless the means of earning full public support are known
many vital projects will be lost to the community.
It is to meet this modern need, that Australasian Seminar Services are
conducting Seminars in five states of Australia (and, also, New Zealand)
to assist all persons connected with any organisation or institution
desiring public funds. Voluntary service club members are invited,
in addition to the paid secretary and Church Laymen.
Guest lecturer is Mr. John E. Brinton of Ketchum Inc., Pittsburgh,
U.S.A., the world’s largest firm of fund-raising specialists. Seminar
Chairman is Mr. Everald Compton, one of Australia's most experienced
fund-raising consultants.
The Seminars are held on Discussion Group lines, in comfortable
surroundings. Refreshments and supper are provided.
Attendance fee is $lO, and the venues for the Seminars in the
different States are as follows:

that could turn out well. It has a
well going down at Yongala in south-
western Queensland, which began last
month and is to go to 6500 feet to test
the porous sandstone interval encoun-
tered in the earlier Yongala well. (Yon-
gala is in the area where Alliance made
its Chandos oil discovery.) It has an-
other well going at Quirindi; it is
continuing a scout-drilling program
near Broken Hill; a gravity survey is
going on in the south-eastern corner of
South Australia, and a decision about
drilling offshore in the Bonaparte Gulf
in the north of Western Australia is
awaited. But unless one of the two
major wells now being drilled by the
Alliance group of companies comes up
with something within the next couple
of weeks, these stocks could enter a
very dull phase for a while.
Beach, which had no success with its
Stansbury Town No. 1 well, is moving
the rig to Berri, where drilling will
commence later this month. It is mak-
ing a 5-cent call on July 12.
Interstate Oil has eased back with
disappointment that the gas at Shell’s
Pecten 1A well in its area has not
turned out commercial in testing so
far. The off-shore rig is being moved to
a site offshore from Anglesea, but still
in Interstate’s backyard.
Oil Search’s Muabu well is now very
deep and has brought no joy, so the
stock has subsided from higher levels
of earlier this year.
THE SEED business was one of the
main attractions of George Fielder &
Co. when the company was closely
examined in “Behind the Balance
Sheets” in The Bulletin of May 6. Since
then, however, one of its big seed de-
velopments, the Uniwager experiment,
has failed. This is disappointing but
not disastrous, as this sort of seed was
only a small part of the rapidly in-
creasing seed operation that is making
up such a large part of Fielder’s pro-
fits these days.
In any event, the company says that
it is developing other “new non-oestro-
genic strains of high agronomic
merit” in which it places great faith
The facts of the Uniwager flop ar g
that George Fielder’s hopes of getting
20 tons of Uniwager clover seed from
its Indian planting were destroyed by
a combination of four factors: the
Qantas air strike, the necessity of satis-
fying Indian cereal authorities, the
coldest, driest growing season for fifty
years, and an electricity strike which
restricted water supplies in the hot
summer.
In the event, only 1601 b. of seed
was produced, so the responsibility
of growing Uniwager seed now rests
with individual Western Australian
producers who planted the remaining
two tons of seed, and with the Indian
Agriculture Research Institute, which
is undertaking further trials.
LAST WEEK a bit of a muddle on this
page messed up details of the quite
unwarranted fall in share prices of
lion-mining stocks. For those who
wondered what the facts really were,
the peak for the year in the ordinary
non-mining index was 297.72 on May
22, which had then fallen to around
the 290 mark. Just to show the market’s
good sense, this index has since fol-
lowed The Bulletin’s advice and re-
covered almost all its lost ground.

Here's a chance
to hot it up
with "Linda"
WITH TYPICAL female cunning
“Linda” timed her grand entrance on
to the Stock Exchange scene to split-
second perfection. The announcement
of her forthcoming wedding with the
Australian public appeared in the morn-
ing Press on the first day of the
official hibernation season (and who
could be warmer to hibernate with
than “Linda”). “Linda” is, of course,
the electric blanket made by Ralta
Holdings Ltd. This company is now
floating off to the public. Besides
making blankets for sleeping warm with,
Ralta also makes fry pans, heating
cables, hair dryers, and slippers. Electric
blankets are, however, the main money-
spinner, and after looking at the statis-
tics it’s easy to understand why. The
rage to switch on at night has boosted
the production of electric blankets from
118,644 in 1964 to 238,174 last year,
and now to 366,124 for the first nine
months of this year.
Last year’s earning rate is reported
as being 16.3 percent on the intended
$1 million capital. A dividend rate of
8 percent is expected for the current
year. On this basis the initial offer at
par seems a good one, doubly so in
view of the current record production.
From warm blankets to cool cotton.
The company this time is Bradford Cot-
ton, one of the largest cotton goods
makers in the country. At a current
price of 58 cents, and a corresponding
yield of 8.5 percent, the stock looks
dejected. In view of its unbroken
dividend record of 32 years’ standing,
and the fact that the cotton textile in-
dustry is now doing “very well thank
you,” the situation seems unreasonable.
I bought 200 on the basis that others
will soon think so, too. Actually, as
Bradford is noted for its wide share
price fluctuations and as 58 cents is
around the bottom of the swing, I feel
prospects of a rise up into the mid-60
cents are not too optimistic to hope
for.
My No. 2 buy this week is also a
company which experiences wide price
variations each year. The company is
S. A. Brush, which is better known to
broom pushers as “Sabco.” Its share
Price is now at a five-year low of 66
cents, when it appears to me that pros-
pects are better than ever. The com-
P an y, as the name implies, is based in
South Australia and is the biggest
broom and brush manufacturer in Aus-
tralia. It manufacturers everything
from paint and heavy-duty industrial
brushes right through to hairbrushes.
The company should benefit from the
healthy state of the consumer market
this year, and its half yearly report
indicates it is doing just that. Both
sales and profits went up in the six
months to December 31.
Another bull point for the company is
that the cost of one of its raw materials
is, curiously, going down. For some
odd reason Communist China, which
controls the world market for pig
bristles, is lowering her bristle prices.
Despite the Red Guards’ disruptive in-
fluences, the country has been able to
lower the price of its bristles by about
15 percent since Christmas. On the
other hand, S.A. Brush, which uses the
bristles for its paint brushes, has not
altered the cost of its brushes one cent.
These savings will mean added profits
for 1966/67. Encouraged, I bought
400 rights at 18 cents each and will
take them up when the time comes
(provided I can’t see a profit in the
meantime).
On the subject of profits and making
them, I feel there is an opportunity for
doing just this with Davies Bros., the
Hobart newspaper stock. I hasten to
add, however, that the problem here is
thin trading. The reason behind my
thinking is that the company is splitting
its $2 shares into $1 shares. This means
that twice as many shares will be
available for trading and, being cheaper,
they will be psychologically more
appealing. At a current price of $6.90,
which is $1.60 below last year’s high,
the company looks interesting. Despite
a small setback in the December half-
year profit, trading is now thought to
be favorable.
Sales this week were Larke Consoli-
dated and Nutt & Muddle. Both showed
small profits. This was particularly satis-
fying in the case of Nutt & Muddle as
it was one of the very few times that
I have ever made anything out of
the poker-machine game.

Security analyst on food-drink-tobacco leaders
British Tobacco clearly
tops the group
OVER THE PAST five weeks, those
companies in the Melbourne Fifty
Leaders Index who are engaged in the
broad food, drink and tobacco group
have been examined. In the case of
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,
diversification outside this industry
group may well mean that, in the
longer term, it may not be so depen-
dent on sugar as at the present time,
but generally one would expect that
the future prospects for these five com-
panies are not too dissimilar.
As at the time of writing, the prices
and earnings are as under:—
Company 1966 Last Dividend Price/
Range Sale Yield Earnings
$ 5 % Ratio
CSR 3.45-2.78 3.25 3.8 14.6
Henry Jones 4.20-2.95 2.95 4.1 10.6
CUB 3.36-3.08 3.12 4.2 14.1
Tooth 5.08-4.76 4.82 3.4 21.3
Brit. Tobacco 2.65-2.24 2.52 4.8 12.1
When the series started, the prices
were somewhat different.
CSR 3.23 3.25 0.7
Henry Jones 3.45 2.95 (14.5)
CUB 3.30 3.12 (5.4)
Tooth 5.02 4.82 (4.0)
British Tobacco 2.56 2.52 (1.5)
With the exception of Henry Jones,
the price changes have not been very
great. The movements in CSR’s and
British Tobacco’s share prices are in-
significant; CUB and Tooth seem to
have moved down together. It is per-
haps a little surprising that even now'
Tooth is still selling at a price/earnings
multiple in excess of 20 times.
The new factor which has occurred
since the series started is another appli-
cation by Great Britain to join the
European Economic Community and
the success of this application will have
some bearing on any assessments of
the future profitability of CSR and
Henry Jones. So far as CSR is con-
cerned, it will be affected if the British
Commonwealth Sugar Agreement is
not renewed for Australia. Henry
Jones will suffer with its fruit sales,
particularly canned fruit. Whereas the
share market has obviously taken some
account of this loss of sales, it does not
seem to have done so in the case of
CSR. The word “obviously” is perhaps
a little strong. It cannot be ignored
that the reason for the fall in Henry
Jones’ share price could be the terms of
the new issue; investors may not even
have thought about the effects of
Britain’s entry into the Common Market.
The price differential between CUB
and Tooth is less capable of explana-
tion. It is surely difficult to believe
that, over the next ten years, Tooth’s
earnings per share will grow at three
times the rate of growth in CUB’s
earnings per share. So far as one can
make any estimate, it would seem
that, even if the price of New South
Wales’ beer was increased over the
next ten years so that it reached the
Victorian price, the average increase in
Tooth’s earnings per share over that
period would be less than 4 percent
per annum. So, even though it is
reasonable to price Tooth’s shares
rather higher than CUB’s shares on
account of this factor, the price dif-
ferential should not be so great. Other
factors seem to be rather irrelevant by
comparison. CUB will meet the com-
petition from the new Courage brewery
with vigor, yet there is no reason to
believe, at this stage, that any sort of
price war will occur.
The interesting company at the pre-
sent time is British Tobacco (which
will have a thirty percent stake in the
new Courage brewery). Of the five
companies, its shares sell at the highest
dividend yield and the second lowest
price/earnings ratio. Yet, over the past
five years, this company seems to have
shown the greatest rate of increase in
earnings and in dividends. Of course, it
did start from a rather low base in
1960/61; this can also indicate the
management’s capacity to overcome
difficulties and to fight back and
recover a lost market share.
At this stage, a comparison of the
indices of adjusted earnings per share
of the five companies could well be of
some interest:
Year ended in 1963 1964 1965 1966
CSR 100 150 124 114
Henry Jones 100 92 96 90
CUB 100 122 134 131
Tooth 100 106 112 109
British Tobacco 100 109 152 166
Clearly, British Tobacco has the best
record over the period, as not only
has it shown the greatest growth but it
is also the only one which has shown a
consistent rise.
Another factor which must be of
interest to investors is the trend in
dividends per share:
Year ended in 1963 1964 1965 1966
CSR 100 130 130 134
Henry Jones 100 103 103 124
CUB 100 104 108 108
Tooth 100 105 109 112
British Tobacco 100 100 110 120
These indices are historical; there
can be no suggestion that history will
repeat itself. To some extent, the
trend in dividends per share will de-
pend on board policy in the various
companies. It seems fairly safe to say
that, in all cases, the boards of these
companies have not shown any reluc-
tance to increase the dividend rate
whenever it would seem to be appropri-
ate. In this event, it can be assumed
that, if earnings per share increase,
then there will be comparable increases
in dividends. Until recently, one might
have had some reservations about the
policy of Henry Jones, where the divi-
dend rate had been unchanged for a
quarter of a century, but the recent in-
crease from 10 cents to 12 cents must
make one revise one’s views on this
matter.
We have some doubts about the
future trend in the earnings of Colonial
Sugar Refining, because it is impossible
to judge the prospects of Britain’s entry
into the Common Market, although
even if this should happen, the effect
could well be cushioned to a consider-
able extent by the group’s interests in
building materials and iron ore. Henry
Jones seems quite vulnerable at the
present time to an entry by Britain into
the Common Market and the trend in
recent years in earnings per share has
been rather disappointing.
Carlton & United particularly has
to face new competition in the future
and it also seems that Tooth will have
to compete with the combination of
Toohey’s and Millers. Tooth still has
the advantage so far as Carlton is con-
cerned in that the beer price in New
South Wales could be raised quite con-
siderably before it is equal to that of
Victoria.
British Tobacco probably has to face
the prospects of a long-term decline
in the demand for tobacco products,
with increasing competition from its
competitors. It is, however, fairly clear
that British Tobacco is looking to other
types of products which will go a
long way to replacing any slow decline
in revenue from tobacco. Apart from
soft drinks and snack foods, the current
ventures have not all been crowned with
success. Misfortunes have occurred in
the frozen foods (including ice-cream)
division and the road to recovery may
be quite a long one. It was also rather
disconcerting to learn from the interim
report for the 1966/67 year that the
sub-group concerned with printing and
packaging had had a difficult time in
the first half of 1966/67 and that profit
was slightly lower. How unfortunate
it is that all companies cannot be pur-
suaded to give figures in their half-
yearly and annual reports which will do
away with the necessity to use vague
words to describe a mathematical
situation.
The overriding impression one gets
from the examination of these com-
panies is one of “competition.” This
would suggest that investment in the
ordinary shares should be approached
with some caution. Nevertheless, one
hardly expects any of these companies
to become bankrupt, so the real ques-
tion is which one has the best pros-
pects in terms of its current price.
On this basis, British Tobacco seems
to take the lead, even though the in-
terim report was not very encouraging.
After that, Carlton & United looks the
best prospect having regard to its price.
Tooth is the only company which has
the appearance of being somewhat over-
priced at the present time on a mathe-
matical basis.

The Chartist agrees
CSR offers some
longer-term
potential, too
pHE MARKET performance of the
stocks under review in the food, drink,
and tobacco group could hardly be
called spectacular. Tooth & Co. would
be the only situation where investors
who bought in 1960 would not be show-
ing a substantial capital loss. British
Tobacco and CSR offer the best poten-
tial rewards for investors holding for
the longer term on present market
action. Carlton “Z”, Henry Jones, and
Tooth & Co. all have downside targets
and could not be recommended at
present.
The all ordinary index No. 15 and
the food, drink, and tobacco index No.
6 can be directly compared with the
individual stocks since 1960. Investors
should also be mindful of the fact that
a great deal of “bearishness” is evident
in the industrial market at the present
time. Sharp reactions could occur even
in the strong stocks moving against the
general trend of the averages.
BRITISH TOBACCO has been
featured on two previous occasions. A
first target of $2.40 was suggested in
February, 1966, which was subsequently
achieved in June of that year. It has
become evident on market action over
the past twelve months that this stock
is going through a new “growth” phase,
and the 1966/67 consolidation pattern
suggests a long-term target of approxi-
mately $3.40. Last sale price on 6/6/67
-$2.52.
CSR was also reviewed last August,
and at that time it was suggested that
this stock was more cyclical rather than
a growth situation. For some months it
remained in a neutral trend and only
recently broke the resistance level at
$3.25 on high volume. The base con-
solidation suggests a rise to approxi-
mately $4.40 for the long term. Resis-
tance selling would be expected to be
strong above the $4.00 level relating to
the two previous peaks in 1961 and
1964. Last sale price on 6/6/67 —$3.24.
CARLTON “Z”: Although the chart
only goes back to 1964, there is suffi-
cient price history to suggest that a
downward movement is more likely to
continue for some time. A target of at
least $2.40 is a distinct possibility. The
fall could accelerate once the support
level at $2.90 is broken. Last sale price
on 6/6/67—53.10.
HENRY JONES could hardly be
regarded as a growth situation, and
some of the “sweetness” has disappeared
in terms of market action; at the present
time recessive tendencies are evident.
An extremely “bearish” situation is
apparent since the break in the support
level at $3.40. Two downside targets
are indicated, the first one at approxi-
mately $2.50, where support would be
forthcoming from the low point of
1960. Any fall below this level could
ultimately be followed by a further
decline to approximately $2.10. Last
sale price on 6/6/67 —$2.79.
TOOTH & CO. is yet another stock
reviewed in November, 1966, and at
that time it appeared to be breaking a
long-term 10 percent primary uptrend.
Prices have since fallen to $4.76 and
a downside target of about $4.00 would
be a possibility, although support would
be strong at the $4.50 level. There is
also a further more pessimistic downside
objective of approximately $3.10. Last
sale price on 6/6/67 —$4.83.

Taking knocks
Look at Kelvinator
a nd Dunlop
By PELIAS in Melbourne
ONE OF THE stocks hit fairly solidly
by the setback in the market early last
week was Kelvinator. In fact, the shares
are currently at their lowest point for
s ix years; they should prove lucrative
medium- to long-term buying at any
price around the current $1.68. At this
level they are only yielding 4| percent
from the 15 percent dividend, which
the group has managed to pay for 14
years on end with never less than a
one-and-a-half times cover. While this
yield may be little attraction, there
are two other points to consider.
First, the six-year low price. Only a
year ago the 50-cent units were fetching
more than $2, and they have seen $3 in
their time. Their lowest point in the
past six years has been $1.60, and it
would appear that they have bottomed
again now. With a recovery in the
market, or in the group’s earning per-
formance, there could be a strong up-
ward trend in the share price.
Second, the stock is extremely bonus-
prone; this is why the shares, although
at a low point, are showing yields of
only \\ percent. At last balance date
ordinary and preference capital of
almost $3 million was heavily out-
weighed by reserves of more than $5
million. It is interesting to note that
the ratio between these two items is
now almost exactly the same as the
ratio ruling before the one-for-four
bonus issue of 1963-64.
Nevertheless, the chances of another
bonus issue are slim until such time as
profits resume an upward trend. If
this takes place in the current year,
thoughts of a bonus will rule in the
market again and there should be a
substantial increase in the share price.
The $3 peak touched in 1964 was on
the strength of that year’s bonus issue.
As the company balances on March
31, it is a little too early to make pre-
dictions about the 1967-68 year. Any
hint of higher profits at the annual
meeting to be held soon would be suf-
ficient reason to buy a parcel, although
the absence of such a hint should not
be taken too seriously, as the group’s
management, excellent as it is, happens
to be ultra-conservative. The best
example of this is the annual tax pro-
vision it has exceeded profits for five
years in a row now. Hence, unknown
secret” reserves could safely be added
to the disclosed $5 million-odd figure
m the balance sheet. Annual profits are
a ho declared after writing off large
sums for items like tooling charges
equalisation and possible stock obso-
lescence. It is doubtful that even half
°f these provisions are called on.
True, the generally depressed state of
activity in South Australia could be
having some impact on Kelvinator. But

Both routine administration and development pro-
jects will benefit from the installation of an I.C.T.
1903 computer by The British Motor Corporation
(Australia) Pty. Limited. Its workload ranges
through payroll and inventory applications, con-
trol of engineering data, press shop loading, parts
and accessories requirements, to Vehicle Relia-
bility Analysis and Operations Research. The
choice of an I.C J. computer is itself the result of
keen investigation and comparison of operational
ease and economy, simplicity of programming
and multi-programming, and provision for expan-
sion as and when required. Once again the con-
elusion is that the I.C.T. Series 1900 offers more
per dollar invested than any other computer.
Direct Access. Information can be obtained
within a fraction of a second by the use of mag-
netic discs in the 1900 range. This means instant
answers to all questions.
Fast Delivery. Deliveries of I.C.T. start within a
year for most configurations.
Simplicity in operation. Communication with
I.C.T. Series 1900 is simple. A typewriter is used
to pass instructions to the computer system in
plain language and an Executive Master Program
takes over.

as it depends more on the improving
markets of N.S.W. and Victoria, the
latest downturn in its price seems to
reflect S.A. investment attitudes rather
than Kelvinator’s fortunes.
ANOTHER STOCK which took a bit
0 f a knock last week was Dunlop.
Situations like this should be relished:
leaders of this calibre inevitably
bounce back once the market steadies
itself. This column expects great things
of Dunlop in the medium- to long-
term for buyers at the current $1.38.
Last March it recommended them at
$1.41 (so did lan Potter, a broking
firm closely allied to the group). Since
then, shareholders have had a four
cents interim dividend and seen the
price get to $1.56 before the slide.
The March article pointed to several
factors which augured for a substantial
recovery by the group this year and
further improvement in 1967-68; things
like the first benefits from the general
expansion, .modernisation, and rationali-
sation started in 1964-65, the upturn
in motor vehicle production, income
from the 1966 tyre price increases, and
returns from the acquisitions and in-
vestments which the group has been
making.
Several other developments have
improved the group’s outlook since
then. It has taken a controlling interest
in Frank O’Neill and presumably the
profits of this highly successful group
will be consolidated into Dunlop’s
accounts for the first time this year.
It has completed $5 million worth of
extensions and improvements to its
Montague (Vic.) factory. It has started
making tyres for the DC-9s now coming
on to our domestic runs. It has won
large RAAF orders for flexible pipes,
wheels, brakes, and fuel tanks for the
Macchi jet trainer. It has signed a
licensing agreement with Ohio Rubber
Co. of the U.S.
In short, the group will probably

Legal Notice
IN THE SUPREME COURT
OF NEW SOUTH WALES
IN DIVORCE
To: FREDERICK EDGAR HAYLETT.
TAKE NOTICE that VALMA FAITH
HAYLETT has filed Petition No. 2003
of 1987 for divorce on the ground of
Adultery and seeks orders for main-
tenance, custody, and costs. If you wish
to defend you may file an Answer in
the Divorce Registry, Supreme Court,
Mint Building. Macquarie Street,
Sydney, on or before the 19. th day of
July, 1967. You may obtain a copy of
the Petition without charge from
Messrs. Gregg Milne & Co., 4 Castle-
reagh Street, Sydney. C. A. H. HARMS,
Registrar.
lift profits in the current half by more
than the 26 percent jump it scored in
the first half. There is every chance
of a lift in dividend and, in 1967-68,
when profits will get a full year’s bene-
fit from all the recent moves, there h
no reason why the payout should not
be restored to 10 percent. The current
eight percent provides a 5.8 percent
dividend yield on the market price
and is not unattractive. If there is no
lift in dividend in the current year,
this may be a pointer to a share issue
later this year or early in 1968; the
group is spending money fast and
seems set to spend a whole lot more.
At $6.90, the rarely traded $2 shares
in the Tasmanian group, Davies Bros.,
are at their lowest point for years and
yielding more than any other newspaper
stock. Apart from other considerations,
one reason for suggesting a parcel is
that they are to be split into $1 units
soon, and such a move invariably leads
to increased prices as the lower price
brings the scrip within the reach of
many more investors. This applies
especially where the pre-split price is as
high as that of Davies Bros.
Davies Bros, seems one of those stocks
which could be bought and put away
for a couple of years. Although the
group is likely to earn lower profits in
the current year, it is solid as a rock,
financially. The 1965-66 15 percent
dividend was covered more than twice
by the 32.8 percent earning rate and
the reduced cover expected for the cur-
rent year is sure to be only temporary.

Elsewhere, both metals and industrials had to endure a fair
amount of variability; they moved stronger over the last two
days. Western Mining put on another 35 cents, reaching $15.30;
Hamersley fully paids rose a net seven cents to $4.22, with the

Mining
Rejuvenating the Golden Mile
THE MOVES AFOOT to rationalise
operations by the Kalgoorlie gold-
mining companies could well bring gold
some of its former glister. If successful,
these moves would quite easily justify
the current prices being paid for Great
Boulder Gold Mines Limited, even with-
out its nickel prospects, and would cer-
tainly ensure a very good future for
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Australia)
Limited and Lake View and Star
Limited. Great Boulder and Lake View
are to jointly examine the commercial
and technical feasibility of a merger of
their existing mining operations. Great
Boulder and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
have agreed to bring the deeper parts
of their leases together under the one
joint development program should the
current deep drilling by Gold Mines
of Australia on its own leases prove
successful.
While the combining of ore haulage
and/or treatment operations by Great
Boulder and Lake View and Star
would certainly help in increasing
throughput and overcoming the prob-
lems these companies are experiencing
due to lack of sufficient labor, the
advantage gained would, in the long
run, not be too clear cut. Certainly,
costs per ton and per ounce of gold
could be expected to fall but, as both
these companies are now receiving the
gold subsidy, any reduction in costs per
ounce of gold would mean a corre-
sponding fall in the subsidy receivable;
for every fall of $1 in costs per ounce,
the subsidy receivable would fall by 75
cents. The producers would have to
save $4 in costs to add $1 to their
profits after subsidy. Thus the real
effectiveness of any operational marriage
will lie in the success the partners hay,e
in increasing their combined outputs of
gold, so as to receive perhaps a lower
subsidy per ounce, but nevertheless a
greater overall sum through the larger
number of ounces.
The possibilities raised by the agrees
ment between Great Boulder and Gold
Mines of Kalgoorlie regarding the
deeper levels of their leases are likely
to provide the real excitement. For
many years Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie,
in conjunction with Western Mining
Corporation, has been investigating
the geology of the “Golden Mile”
in an endeavor to find major repetitions
at depth of the original mineralisation,
the remnants of which are providing
the Kalgoorlie miners with their current
ore. Results of geological interpretation
warranted the sinking of a test drill
which was completed during the last
financial year (the 15 months to June,
1966). Drilling conditions, however,
were extremely difficult and the hole
went to only 2753 feet.
A second drill was commenced late
last year, but no progress reports have
yet been released by the company. The
same difficult drilling conditions have
also been encountered in a drill hole
being sunk to test the southern part of
the Kalgoorlie geology. This hole is
being drilled by Gold Mines of Kal-
goorlie and Western Mining Corpora-
tion in conjunction with Newmont
Mining of the U.S.A. and the Consoli-
dated Mines Selection Company of the
U.K.
These drill holes are aiming at depths
well below the present operations of the
companies. The drill hole being sunk
by Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie will have
to go to between 4000 feet and 8000
feet, while the southern hole, which is
being drilled on leases held by Kal-
goorlie Southern Gold Mines NL, is at
levels below 6000 feet and drilling on.
In the context of the deep mining which
these holes could lead to, it is thus a
rational move for Gold Mines of Kal-
goorlie to obtain the greatest possible
area of ground at depth in order to
improve the economics of any deep-
mining venture.
The capital cost of sinking a shaft
for a deep (i.e., below 5000 feet) mine
and equipping it for production would
be considerable. Hence the willingness
of the Australian companies to obtain
partners from overseas for the venture.
Should the Kalgoorlie Southern drill
hole warrent a new mine, Newmont
Mining and Consolidated Mines Selec-
tion will no doubt take up their option
to acquire a 50-percerit interest. The
expertise of the latter company in deep
mining, from its long experience in
South Africa, would be of consider-
able help in such a project and Gold
Mines of Australia would undoubtedly
offer an interest in any deep mine on
its own leases to such a company, a
director of which, Mr. H. F. Oppen-
heimer, has said that development of
the deeper mines would not be allowed
to languish for the lack of capital.
Development of a deep mine on
either Gold Mines of Australia’s leases
or those held by Kalgoorlie Southern
(30.6 precent owned by Western Min-
ing, and 24.9 percent owned by Gold
Mines of Kalgoorlie) would of course
proceed only if the drill holes prove
the existence of ore-bodies containing
grades similar to those found nearer the
surface in the more golden days of
Kalgoorlie’s history. And this would
not be established overnight drills to
the depth required take a considerable
time to be completed, and the economics
of such depths require that substantial
quantities of ore be proved before the
decision to sink a shaft is warranted.
Indeed, if a mine was to be con-
sidered at all, it would have to pro-
duce at very high levels of throughput
to be economic. About eighteen months
ago Mr. Lindesay Clark said that suc-
cess in either of these ventures could,
on the history of the Kalgoorlie field
support a mine treating 100,000 tons
of ore per month for many years. The
size of such a mine can be compared
with the present output of Gold Mines
of Kalgoorlie of about 57,000 tons
of ore each month. At that time Mr
Lindesay Clark also said that it would
be reasonable to expect costs of $7 t 0
$8 per ton of ore treated and grades
of 8 to lOdwt. of gold per ton. On
the basis of these figures, monthly
revenue from such a mine would be
between $1.2 million and $1.5 million
while costs (at $8 per ton) would
account for $BOO,OOO. The remaining
profit of between $450,000 and $760,000
per month, tax free, shows what rewards
the dreep-drilling programs could bring
if successful. Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie,
the biggest profit earner on the field,
last year earned a profit of $720,000
for a 15-month period.
Certainly, the type of drilling being
done is speculative rather than develop-
mental but, should the results of either
deep hole encourage the companies con-
cerned to continue the drilling program,
the prospects for the Kalgoorlie miners
would have to be upgraded consider-
ably; the potential from such a mining
operation as described here could make
Western Mining’s nickel operation take
second place.
Commodities
A bullish mood
for wolfram
THE WOLFRAM MARKET is in
a very bullish mood at present, with
much talk of prices around 390/- to
400/- stg. a unit 30/- above the
present quote. The 362/6 a unit
ceiling which was theoretically set on
London prices by the unrestricted sale
of ore from U.S. Government stocks
at a fixed price, was proved not very
substantial.
The immediate cause of the recovery
in prices (which had drifted toward
330/- earlier this year) was reports
that Chinese sales at the Canton Trade
Fair in May were lower than expected.
Only 1500 tons was sold, compared
with the usual 2500-3000 tons, it is
reported. A dispute over terms of
purchase was said to have reduced
sales.
With the next Canton Fair about
four months away, and continued talk
of a lift in the U.S. selling price,
consumers have grown anxious. There
are several reasons why the extra
demand so generated has not been
absorbed in the U.S. sales. Partly
there are the problems and costs in*

volved in purchase of the ore f or
export, partly there is a concern that
any large foreign buying will result i n
restrictions on the sale. Also the grade
of material being offered is not up to
commercial needs.
Stocks in most consuming nations
are said to be low and there seems
little chance of a step-up in supply
So wolfram prices, as has been stated
here before, will not fall for any
length of time below about 350/- i n
the foreseeable future.
Equally, given the present U.S,
policy on sales, a rise above 400/- J s
not likely indeed 365/- could still
prove to be the effective ceiling. But
any lift in the U.S. disposal price or
restrictions on quantity or buyer will
quite likely cause a smart lift in Lon-
don prices.
IT SEEMS QUITE likely that the
meeting of copper-producing nations in
Lusaka this month will not produce anv
concrete action to control world
markets. Apart from the many other
problems, the temporary lift in London
Metal Exchange prices will weaken the
resolve of Chile, so far the most deter-
mined supporter of price-fixing.
LME prices were first boosted by a
dealer (owned by Rothschild-Oppen-
heimer companies) cornering the
market. Before traders had a chance to
recover from this upset, speculators
moved in on the Middle East ructions.
The plunge in prices late last week
emphasised the temporary nature of the
market recovery, however.
At present the main value of the
kites being flown last week on possible
moves at the meeting is as an indication
of the producers’ views of their position.
The £stg3oo-370 a ton range reported
by the London “Financial Times” was
being mooted at a time when LME
prices were just on the proposed
“ceiling.”
Probably facilities for future consul-
tation between the main producing
nations will be the only publicly
announced result of the conference.
There will undoubtedly be much to dis-
cuss in coming months not much
of it pleasant for producers.
ZIRCON PRICES have been quite
steady for many months, after slipping
slightly from the levels reached in the
rise which ended early last year. The
Australian East Coast producers, who
dominate the market, have acted to hold
prices.
One of the reasons for this care to
eliminate wild moves in price was the
substitution of chrome sands for zir-
con in foundries after the last market
rise. However, chromite has not been
a great success in moulding applications
and zircon has won back some markets.
At the current f.o.b. price of $4B a
ton, zircon is a very profitable product
with an assured if unspectacular future.

Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors—including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved —even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course
will convince you.

THE LAND
A bargain on quarantine?
By the RURAL EDITOR
THE INTRINSIC value of a parti-
cular breed of livestock is perhaps of
minor importance compared with the
assets and ambitions of the men who
own the breed. One hundred years ago
Shorthorns and Herefords from the
British Isles were used to open up the
rangelands of the United States. Prob-
ably there were cattle equally as good
obtainable in Germany and France and
other parts of Europe. But the real
point was that the Liverpool and
London merchants who put their money
into American cattle-raising and Ameri-
can railroads and killing works natur-
ally saw to it that good British live-
stock was sent across the Atlantic to
form the basis of their overseas enter-
prise.
From the end of the Civil War to
World War I the United States was
the biggest exporter of meat in the
world and much of this export trade
was financed from Britain. Now, the
men with the money to spend are
Americans, and in cattle they favor
their own. The cattle themselves are a
small part of the overall investment.
Land, fences, shipping, killing works,
and distribution facilities absorb most of
the money. But the cattle are the
reason for it, and they become the
symbol of the entire operation.
As the Shorthorn epitomised John
Bull, the Santa Gertrudis epitomises the
Texas rancher. The fact that the
owners of the herds get most of their
personal wealth from oil and industrial
investments is beside the point, as is the
fact that often (in Australia, anyway)
a befuddled local population ends up
paying for the roads and many of the
facilities needed to make the cattle
operation go. The local population
in the long term, shares in the benefits
arising from the American investment
In the short term, some of the locals
do better than others,
Santa Gertrudis are not the only
breed of cattle highly developed in the
United States, of course. Their Poll
Herefords, for example, have lono
enjoyed a world reputation. Whatever
the respective merits of these, and other
breeds in the U.S. as cattle, the Santas
somehow do best at carrying the flag,
And from all accounts they are good
cattle. Claims made for them are no
more extravagant than similar claims
for other cattle.
At present they are a minority
breed in Australia. Those that are
here are mainly stock upgraded by
crossing with local cattle or other
breeds (after four generations of re-
peated crossing you get a classified
animal) and stem from bulls imported
before the quarantine regulations pre-
vented imports about 15 years ago.
The ban has proved a bonanza for
breeders lucky enough to get cattle (of
many breeds) into the country immedi-
ately prior to its enforcement. Some-
thing, soon, seems likely to give. The
Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, has been
endeavoring, during his trip to the

United States, to get a relaxation of
, American 25 percent tariff on wool
. orts from Australia. One concession
Jvhich has been mentioned could be a
relaxation, in return, of the Australian
r jff 0 n American tobacco coming into
Australia. Another, which has not been
mentioned but which seems on the
cards, is at least a noticeable change in
quarantine policy.
Dr. Forbes, the Minister for Health,
has said that consideration will be given
to a proposal to establish an exotic-
diseases testing station in Australia.
Various diseases would actually be im-
ported and tested by our veterinarians
a n d other experts to evaluate the risk
under Australian conditions. This sug-
gestion has aroused opposition from
farmers, including stud-cattle breeders,
who say that it would be safer to send
o ur vets overseas to study the diseases
where they actually occur. The risk
0 f a nearby exotic-diseases station is
too great, they say. Dr. Forbes, so far,
has not mentioned any particular
diseases or any particular carriers, real
or imaginary.
At the recent sale of Santa Gertrudis
cattle in Texas, however, a well-known
Queensland Santa Gertrudis breeder
said that Australia might soon set up
a quarantine station on an “island”
off the coast. He did not say which
island; there are dozens which might
be suitable. It was a rather significant
speech made in a rather significant
place.
It is distressing to those who believe
in science as a pure cause that quaran-
tine regulations can be bandied around
like this for motives which have little,
or nothing, to do with science. But
there is nothing new in it. It has been
going on for a long time and is not
confined to the importation of cattle
and other animals from overseas. There
have been many instances of quarantine
being used to prevent the traffic of this
or that animal, or agricultural produce,
across State borders. There is also
nothing new in the Australian taxpayer
bearing the major burden of a cost
which, properly, should be borne by
those who will obtain most benefit.
The present scale of direct and
indirect taxation in Australia prevents
most Australians from sharing in the
development of the undoubted potential
which exists in the north, the west, and
in many undeveloped southern regions
of the continent. These same taxes go
to provide the roads and facilities
utilised by the American and other
developers.
The farm lobbies in the U.S. may
take the view that relaxation of the
wool tariff is too high a price to pay
for concessions for tobacco and cattle
(If, indeed, they do eventuate). All
things taken into account, this particular
horse trade needs to be our way by a
wide margin if we are to build an
island quarantine station, and staff it,
°n top of everything else we are doing
to make American investors welcome.


Agrisearch
Farming without the hayseeds
DR. D. E. TRIBE, Professor of Animal
Husbandry, University of Melbourne,
fetched Victorian Western District
sheep farmers up short recently with
a doleful description of long-term pros-
pects. According to him, the moving
fingers of science and economics were
spelling out the message that the wool-
growers, like the poultry producers be-
fore them, must amalgamate or perish.
These are not his very words, but they
sum up the main impression of the
listeners.
He was addressing the third annual
conference run for the sheep people by
the Ballarat Agricultural and Pastoral
Society. This regular meeting, which is
held during first-term hols, at the C.
of E. Boys’ Grammar School, Ballarat,
has already won considerable acclaim.
Big-name scientists, economists, pro-
fessional advisers, and industrial bosses
are attracted to speak at it and lead
discussion. They come from as far west-
A possible 500 calves in the rack
ward as Perth and Armidale in the
north.
The theme of the first discussion
meeting, or symposium, as the organis-
ers prefer to call this pow-wow between
the learned and the landed, was
“Higher Returns from Pasture.” That
of last year’s was “Making Manage-
ment Pay.” The talks and debates at
these symposia primarily concerned
ways and means of applying the new-
fangled theory of higher stocking. This
year an attempt was made to face up
to the problem of organising funds and
facilities to cope with the extra num-
bers of sheep, and so the theme song
was “Developing the Plan.”
Generally, speakers took this to
mean a five-year plan, but Professor
Tribe chose to look at the predicament
a generation hence to see how we ought
to begin to gird our loins. He indicated
that the distant future was by no
means obscured by the mists of the
years. There were several inescapable
biological facts that charted the main
roads well ahead. The first of these
was that the human population of the
world would have doubled by the cen-
tury’s end and doubled again before the
next 50 years are run. Meanwhile, two-
thirds of thfe existing population is
inadequately fed. Hence we may be
confident that food-getting will com-
mand more and more attention in agri-
culture, and other types of primary
products, such as fibres, less and less.
Secondly, agriculture as a means of
making food and fibre is inherently and
grossly inefficient compared with other
methods. It will, accordingly, be sup-
planted just as soon as existing chemi-
cal and mechanical processes become
economically competitive. The writing
is on the wall already for many fibres,
including sisal, cotton, and wool, and
animal fats. Acceptable substitutes for
butter we have had for some time.
Synthetic milks are for sale in the
supermarkets of the U.S.A., and people
in Britain have eaten tolerably good
facsimiles of steak made directly from
grass. Many people, some even here
in Australia, haven’t worn a stitch of
natural fibre in years. Bacteria, fungi,
and algae will certainly be used in-
creasingly to produce edible protein,
carbohydrate, and vitamins.
We can assume that within the next
few decades probably all crops will be
grown under irrigation, the water being
pumped and purified from the sea. Dr.
Tribe envisages that ploughing will by
then be done chemically some is
already and the yield and time of
maturation of the crops will also be
controlled chemically. (A few weeks
ago this column described the use of
the chemical gibberellic acid to stimu-
late a sixfold increase in pasture
growth during winter, when stock are
often most in need of feed.) It is fore-
seen that the time is approaching
when the area of utilisable land avail-
able will not be as critical as the supply
of chemicals for stimulating and con-
trolling the production obtained from
it.
By AD 2000, wheat crops yielding
in the vicinity of 150 bushels per acre
will be common. Quoting an Ameri-
can authority, Dr. Tribe expects that
we will soon have complete control
over reproduction in animals, includ-
ing the sex of the progeny. At the
moment animal improvement is still
in the hands of rank amateurs pedi-
gree breeders. Within another decade
or so they will be gone. In their place
will be large establishments run scien-
tifically and equipped with computers
to organise the matings. Semen and
fertilised eggs or foetuses for transplan-
tation into foster-mothers will be sold
by these outfits rather than stud rams
Such enormous changes in product
tion methods imply sweeping changes
in farm economics and the social char-
acter and general quality of rural life
Dr. Tribe fancies that when this time
comes he would not find himself hanker-
ing to live in the country, as he often
does now. Because profitability increases
with farm size and specialisation
more unalterable facts farms will be-
come much bigger in area, but, at the
same time, more intensive. The capital
required to set up and maintain these
concerns will be astronomical. The days
of the family farm are numbered. More-
over, the people running the farms of
the future will need encyclopedic
knowledge. Again quoting the Ameri-
can source, he mentioned that “farm-
ing is being cleansed of clodhoppers
and hayseeds.” And this will be a good
thing for everybody.
Although we are lagging several years
behind the American trend toward an
“agribusiness” way of farming, the cor-
poration, the syndicate, and the vert-
ically integrated combine has begun to
replace the individual family farm
here, too. The poultry industry, for
instance, is pretty vertical in Australia
already. Feed firms, hatcheries, proces-
sors, packers, and retailers have the
chicken raisers in a firm grip. In
reality, these farmers are no longer
independent decision - makers, but
merely caretakers tied to the wheel of
the grindstone by having their capital
entangled in the integration. Dairy,
pig, beef, and sheep production are
all ripe for a similar alignment.
It is easy to see dairying being
straightened out. For instance, the
Nobel Prize winning Finn A. I. Vir-
tanen has maintained a small dairy
herd for five or more years on a diet
completely devoid of protein. Yet the
production from this herd is up to aver-
age for that part of the world. The
quality and flavor of the milk is also
average. The diet Virtanen provides his
cows is made up from carbohydrate,
urea, ammonium salts, corn oil, a
mineral mixture, and vitamins. Such a
diet could lower a farmer’s costs of
production. One can imagine a feed
firm mixing up this diet and then
approaching the local cow cockies with
a deal: you buy this and we will sell
your milk for you.
With the advance of agribusiness,
our politics will cease to be concerned
with the needs of a scattering of indi-
vidual farmers, but with marshalling
vast business organisations whose capi-
tal may be owned in America and
Europe. Such changes are inevitable.
It will be no use to fight them, Dr.
Tribe warned. At best we may hope to
recognise what is happening to us.
Perhaps then we could govern the
speed and direction of the changes to
some extent so that they don’t hurt too
badly. Who still plans to put his son
on the land?


A FEELING FOR THE PAST

One of a series on "Living is an Art" by SHEELAH WOOD
MRS. GREGORY BLAXLAND, of
Sydney, is a tall, elegant member of
|he family of four girls and three boys
)or n to the late Sir Robert and Lady
Anderson. Among the family she was
considered the artistic -one.
Her mother, one of the first women
to graduate as B.A. from Sydney Uni-
yersity, was considered very advanced
111 her care of the children. When the
family moved to England after World
War I, Helen attended a co-educational
school. She finished her education in
Australia, but has been fortunate enough
to visit Europe many times.
At 20, Helen married Gregory Blax-
land, a direct descendant of the ex-
plorer. This may have led to her in-
terest in historical Sydney and the
National Trust, of which she is an
energetic member. She also is a mem-
ber of Sydney’s Fountains Committee.
Though she is the author of two
witty books on flower-arranging, Mrs.
Blaxland now favors the use of greenery
and ferns in the decoration of her own
house. She says, “There is no house
that is not improved by flowers, but
if you are having a party, ask some

young girls; they are pretty and far
cheaper!”
The Blaxlands’ only child, Antonia,
was a photographer before her marriage
to Quentin Stanham, of Camden Park.
They have two children.
Mrs. Blaxland has done a great deal
to encourage young artists. She herself
studied art with Julian Ashton. She
always remembers him telling her to
“take her nudes out of their furry
clothing!” In those days Sydney
artists kept to themselves and she con-
siders she was lucky that through the
late Sydney Ure Smith and her own
interest she was fortunate in meeting
them and including them in her life
and parties.
Mrs. Blaxland likes traditional houses.
Her own house was originally the lodge
of an early mansion and has old cedar
doors and skirtings. It has survived two
fires to attain its present elegant state.
Mrs. Blaxland’s garden is a green one.
It has a contrived beauty of trees, ferns,
camellias, ground covers of ivy, and
paved and gravelled areas where old
stone seats invite you to be lazy.
She loves entertaining and quotes Elsa
Maxwell, “If you owe a bore a dinner,
send him one, don’t spoil the party.
Her favorite number for dinner n
eight* and she asks her guests for 7.3


to dine at 8 o’clock. “Make the guests
wait for the souffle and never hurry
between courses,” she says. She mixes
a martini as an aperitif and sets a
tray of spirits. Olives, good pate, and
cheese biscuits are the usual hors-
d’oeuvre. She never serves more than
three courses, plus cheese, and she serves
only two wines with dinner.
Mrs. Blaxland says: “It is not long
since this country had the reputation
of having some of the best raw 7 foods
in the world before going into the
kitchen and, on the whole, the worst
food in the world when it came out!”
Mercifully, she feels, over the past few 7
years the situation has changed for the
better.
Mrs. Blaxland thinks the greatest dif-
ficulty we still face is getting decent
lettuce. Unless you are clever enough
to grow your own, you have a choice
°f the boring Iceberg type, varied
occasionally with some tough and flabby
endive. “Where are the Bostons, the
Bibs, the Cos? Where are the Mig-
nonettes of yesteryear? I don’t know 7
where they are, but I know where they
ar e not, and that’s here,” she says.
However, on the credit side, there
are our wines. How well we can drink
a nd at such a moderate cost! And
that is, after all, one of the things that
m atters most.

refrigerated. Meanwhile, chop bacon
finely and cook slowly in a pan until
crisp. Pour off nearly all fat. Beat the
egg slightly, add vinegar and water, and
mix well. Pour over the bacon and cook
slowly, stirring until the egg is cooked.
Let cool and pour over the lettuce while
still warm but not hot. Toss well
DINNER
(for six persons)
Before dinner, sherry or martini—
both dry olives, sharp hot cheese
biscuits.
ARTICHOKE HEARTS IN BATTER
Ingredients: A iar or so of small arti-
choke hearts (as we so prettily call
them). More accurately the French
call them “fonds,” while the Italians
always realists, are content to leave
them anonymous while clearly blazon-
ing the trade-name on the cover.
Malt vinegar, freshly ground pepper
and paprika, 6oz. plain flour, season-
ing of salt, beer.
Method: Take artichokes, strain off
oil, and marinate in a little malt
vinegar, the pepper, and paprika.
For the batter, take the flour and salt
and sift into a basin. Make a hole in
centre and slowly add beer, stirring all
the time until a cream-like consistency
has been reached. Then beat well and
put batter aside for at least 3 hours.
Strain the marinade off the artichokes
and dry. Dip in batter and drop into
smoking hot fat. Fry carefully—these
hearts take a surprisingly long time to
heat and cook through, 12-15 minutes,
until golden brown. Drain well and
serve very hot, garnishing with a great
deal of freshly fried parsley.
POULET SIMLA WITH HOT RICE
Ingredients: 1 freshly roasted chicken,
f pint stiffly whipped cream, 3 table-
spoons Worcester sauce, \\ teaspoons
mustard, salt and pepper.
Method: Cut up chicken and arrange
in a fireproof dish. Add the Worcester
sauce, mustard, salt and pepper to
the cream and pour over the chicken.
Stand in a moderate oven until a thin,
brown skin has formed on the sauce—
about 15 minutes. Hot Rice is boiled
rice flavored with a heaped teaspoon—
or more—of dry curry powder, and
finely chopped mango chutney to taste.
PEARS IN COINTREAU
Ingredients: .6 pears (ripe but firm),
lemon juice, 2 cups brown sugar, 1
cup cointreau.
Method: Put a little lemon juice in a
bowl of cold water. Peel pears, leaving
on stalks, and immediately place in
lemon-water to prevent discoloration.
Meanwhile, boil sugar with 3 cups cold
water. When it has boiled a few minutes
add pears and cook until tender but not
mushy. Dip each pear into the cup oj
cointreau, saturating thoroughly, and
place in serving dish, stalks to centre.
Boil liquid till slightly thickened, add
liqueur, and pour over pears. Chill wel
and serve with heavy cream and Sponge
Fingers.


BOOKS
Nabokov’s lost paradise
By R. G. HOWARD
Speak, Memory. Vladimir Nabokov.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $5.45.
ON THE BACK of the dust jacket of
this book there is a photograph of
Nabokov taken from below as if to
emphasise his resemblance to Alfred
Hitchcock. It is Hitchcock in an un-
usually austere mood, but still, bald
forenead and fleshy face, the resem-
blance is there. It reminds us that
in his recent prefaces, Nabokov has
come perilously close to the heavy tone
of facetious Hitchcock’s television intro-
ductions: that both men are astonish-
ingly self-conscious and curiously defen-
sive about their work. This apart, of
course, Hitchcock’s hopelessly com-
promised art is a far cry from the
uncompromisingly personal art of
Nabokov.
Turning to the portraits of Nabokov
inside the book, one must be struck by
their lack of rapport with that haughty
cover photo. Did the same man really
pose for all those disparate pictures?
The most striking one shows Nabokov
at 16, elegantly dressed in a pin-striped
suit, hair parted almost in the middle,
gazing to one side with patrician
assurance and affability. In the next
one, at 19, looking rather like the youth-
ful Gary Cooper, he is all dreamy in-
genuousness. Only a year later, at
Cambridge, he resembles, to continue
the stellar comparisons, the youthful
George Sanders, a raffish, sardonic un-
dergraduate, something like his own
character Sebastian Knight. Now comes
a gap of nine years, and we see him
in a snapshot taken by his wife while
he was in the throes of composition.
This must be the real Nabokov, one
thinks. But, showing his wrong pro-
file, his face all twisted with concen-
tration, he looks like a retarded adoles-
cent struggling over his homework.
Finally, in 1937, now like Joseph von
Sternberg, or his own Humbert Hum-
bert, he is once again amazingly trans-
formed.
Transformed or disguised? The dif-
ferent faces in all these photographs
(and there are others in the pictures
adorning earlier dust jackets), the dif-
ferent personalities they project, are
exactly appropriate, for Nabokov the
a uthor is as protean and unpredictable
as most enigmatic of his characters.
He is perhaps at his most elusive in
the prefaces already mentioned, where,
at once mocking and cajoling his
r eaders, he provides rather pedantic
bibliographical information, deliberately
points out the wrong approach to the
work in question, ridicules the critics
in advance, and gives genuine insight
all in the space of a page or two.
No doubt psychology, that pet aver-
sion of his (together with communism
—both of which try to take away man’s
individuality), might explain these
apparent aberrations. But isn’t it better
to accept him at his own evaluation, as
a complex and superbly irrational be-
ing? In any case no amount of ex-
plaining will resolve the real ambiva-
lence of some of his attitudes—those,
for instance, of the cold, contemptuous
observer of stupidity, conformism,
blindness, and of the anguished recorder
of the pitiful and the vicious, writing
with a “mixture of ferocity and jocu-
larity that betrays misery.”
Within Nabokov, as within all of us
for that matter, there surely exists a
number of discrete and contradictory
selves. Consistency of behaviour, I sus-
pect, is more often apparent than real.
The cinema presents the illusion of
movement by rapidly changing still pic-
tures; and maybe we are used to a some-
what similar illusion when it comes to
human character.
Thus it will be pointless to look in
this autobiography for a key to its
author’s complex personality. There is
a predominant face turned toward us
as we read, but it must not be taken
for that of the essential Nabokov.
Nabokov is one of those men for
whom childhood is a paradise lost which
he constantly tries to regain through
memory. He himself speaks of his
hypertrophied sense of lost childhood,
and this is very apparent in “Speak,
Memory.” It is hardly surprising;
in the first place because his childhood
was truly paradisial, and in the second
because he was quite literally cast out
of it.
He was born into a family both
wealthy and famous. His parents were
intelligent and cultured, loving and in-
dulgent. No childhood can have been
more perfect than his, with its idyllic
summers on a Russian country estate,
surrounded by delightful people and
the beauties of nature. Nabokov’s des-
cription is enchanting. The book has
a charm and a tenderness that he quite
obviously reserves for childhood memor-
ies, as they occur only rarely in the
novels.
Yet they do occur there. Now and
Vladimir Nabokou
then in the novels (“The Defence”
and “The Gift” especially, but also
“The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,”
“Pnin,” and “Pale Fire”) one comes
across a glowing description, full of
passionate nostalgia. The effect of read-
ing the autobiography is as if all these
passages from the novels had been
assembled under one cover, but it repre-
sents on the contrary the fabulous
source from which, with the tender
frugality of one using up a precious
store, Nabokov has taken now one and
now another item for his fiction.
Suddenly Nabokov and his family
found themselves cast out of their Eden.
With the beginning of the Revolution,
Nabokov senior sent his family to the
Crimea. When the Reds began to pene-
trate even there they fled to Greece,
and thence to England, having lost all
their possessions save a handful of
jewels. Nabokov and one of his brothers
were given scholarships to Cambridge.
Nabokov graduated, went to Berlin,
married, moved to Paris, and in 1940
left Europe for America.
The chapters of this autobiography
were assembled from various magazines
for the first book publication in 1951.
Although a cursory comparison of that
original version with the present one
suggests that the changes are fairly
minimal, I do have the impression that
Nabokov’s attitude has become more
bitter in looking back to his childhood.
He is now living in Europe, not, of
course, in his beloved Russian country-
side, but in Switzerland, and perhaps
this accounts for his acute sense of
loss.
The bitterly nostalgic old man is not,


however, the only person glimpsed in
the autobiography. Most of the faces
familiar from the novels are there as
well, and also one that is new, and
surprising, the family snob. To counter
this there is my own favorite
Nabokov, John Shade, the gentle old
scholar and poet of “Pale Fire,” a
man whose tolerance has not dimmed
his satirical eye, and whose wisdom is
equal to his wit. This is perhaps the
Nabokov seen in a portrait on the cover
of the American edition of “Despair.”
If I have emphasised the fact that
the pages of “Speak, Memory” are
filled with a whole rogues’ gallery of
faces, this is not to suggest that Nabokov
set out to draw a self-portrait of any
kind. His personality comes through
as inadvertently, and as ineluctably, in
this book as in any of the novels. It
is wrought moreover with just as much
conscious artistry. What he actually
set out to do is conveyed in a state-
ment at the beginning of Chapter Five.
“I have often noticed,” he writes, “that
after I had bestowed on the characters
of my novels some treasured item of
my past, it would pine away in the
artificial world where I had so abruptly
placed it.” The autobiography is thus
a “desperate attempt” to save from
this kind of oblivion, and for his own
benefit, what is still left from his past.
Whatever the motives behind its com-
position, “Speak, Memory” is for the
reader a memorable experience. When
I first read the 1951 version I thought
it possibly the finest autobiography ever
written, and I have not yet changed
my opinion.
Inside the SSO
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Facing the Music. Helen Bainton. Curra-
wong. $3.95.
MEMBERS OF orchestras seldom write
books, but those that do seem to be
viola-players. Offhand, I can only
think of three publications and the
authors are all “violas”: “The Orches-
tra Speaks,” by Bernard Shore, of the
BBC Symphony; a standard work on
the viola d’amore by Professor Stumpf,
of the Vienna Philharmonic; and now,
“Facing the Music,” by Helen Bainton,
of our own Sydney Symphony.
At present sharing a desk with Mar-
garet Berriman, the sister-in-law of one
of our leading music critics, Miss Bain-
ton has been a familiar figure to
audiences since 1936, and the glimpses
she gives of life behind the notes and
between the barlines will make fas-
cinating reading for every concert-goer.
For the first time our orchestra has
found a voice: one could perhaps object
that it is rather sotto voce, but it is
difficult to see how it could be other-
wise with the Official Secrets Act, that
most effective muzzle of ABC employees
past and present on the one hand, and
the libel law, that equally stringent
impediment to outspoken musical
criticism on the other.
It is not surprising, therefore, to
find that Helen Bainton’s loudest com-
ments are to be found in the omissions.
One can, for instance, search in vain
for the name of the Italian conductor
of 1962, Francesco Mander, whom the
former ABC management was said to
have earmarked for the job that Dean
Dixon ultimately got, or for any com-
ments about Georges Tzipine who con-
ducted annually in Sydney throughout
his term as resident of the Victorian
Symphony (when Melbourne subscribers
dropped away in droves).
However, there are many mini-
scoreboards of other conductors Miss
Bainton has known, with large credits
and few debits, ranging from Klemperer
and Szell to Horenstein and Krips. Like
all good orchestral players, she possesses
that legendary ability for assessing the
technical knowledge of the man who
raises the baton, often even before the
first downbeat. But, typically, she often
shows a player’s well-known disability
for hearing the interpretative results of
a work (with the brass in one ear and
the double-basses in the other) as it
comes over to the auditorium as a
whole. One example is her dubbing of
Loren Maazel, now one of the world’s
greatest, as a “for the eye” conductor
while no such qualification is attached
to such famous prima donnas of the
baton as Sir Thomas Beecham, who
often did play for “looks.” (Furt-
waengler called him “an amateur of
genius.”)
The SSO has never made any secret
of the fact that they hate playing “pit
ponies” for opera and ballet, which
always seemed unreasonable when the
Vienna Philharmonic and other great
overseas orchestras do not object. Miss
Bainton makes it clear for the first
time that they have a legitimate case
. . . against local theatres . . . wedged
together, subjected to icy blasts from'
below and duststorms from above. All
the same, she found Stefan Haag’s pro-
ductions “notable for their originality
of thought,” singling out “Fidelio”
especially. Obviously she had never seen
Wieland Wagner’s revolutionary pro-
duction, nor, she admits, did she have
a very good view of the Elizabethan
one.
But she is on firmer home ground
with her wholehearted tributes to Rankl
and Post as our best opera-conductors
which I fully endorse and with
her nostalgic homage to Goossens’
pioneering work. She has a genuine
understanding of the psychology of an
orchestra and of the unique relation-
ship that can exist between players and
conductors. However, the reasons she
gives for the Elizabethan Opera’s termi-
nation of Rankl’s contract seem open
to question. The story I had from the
horse’s mouth was quite different and
this included two quotations of Rankl’s
from the non-renewal letter of the
Trust’s general manager.
The Appendix listing the first occa-
sion on which a work was performed
by the SSO is well intentioned i n Con .
cept but somewhat misleading in p rac
tice, because the list is not exhaustive
When Helen Bainton writes at length of
such early visitors as Schneevoigt and
Szell one expects to find those Sibelius
symphonies and Mahler’s Fifth and
Sixth and Bruckner’s Sixth introduced
here by the former and the “firsts” done
by the latter conductors. As these items
are not listed at all, one might even
conclude that they have yet to be per-
formed here. The same goes for the
Daphnis and Chloe Suite No. 2 by
Ravel, conducted by Abravanel and
Goossens but also unacknowledged. But
the missing asterisk from Richard
Meale’s “Lorca” (which would have
denoted its world premiere in October
1964, under Post) is possibly due to a
printing error.
Despite its faults, Miss Bainton’s book
does in many ways fill an existing gap,
while her sincere dedication to her work
and her deep love of music unmis-
takably place her in the category of
those players who not only “play to
live,” but also, to use her own words,
“live to play.”
Scapegoat of Russia
By SUSAN YORKE
Rasputin the Holy Devil. Rene Fulop
Miller. Fontana Books. Collins. 80
cents.
“RASPUTIN” means “the dirty one,”
“debauchee,” or “ravisher of girls,” all
of which is an accurate but incomplete
description of the exceptional man who
made the name famous. It is also the
original name of the Siberian village
where he was born, Podkino Rasputie,
for which reason various families have
held the name for centuries.
Licentious and scandalous as this book
was termed when first it was published
in hard cover in 1928, the modem
paperback reprint, read after the pas-
sage of years, shows it to be an un-
usually well-documented and ably writ-
ten slice of fascinating history con-
cerned dispassionately with an epoch
deliberately misrepresented by those
who overthrew it.
The good-natured, honest weakling
Emperor Nikolai II and his shy Ger-
man-born consort, the Empress Alexan-
dra, isolated from a reality they were
both too frightened to face, managed to
survive 23 catastrophic years in the
secluded bourgeois bliss of Tsarskoe
Selo, their palace-home outside the
capital. Essentially well - meaning
humanitarians, anxious to do their best
for “the true Russian people” — about
whom they knew nothing at all —their
rule was muddled and disorderly until
they came under the influence of the
holy man Grigori Efimovich Rasputin
the first and only representative of th e
people they ever became friendly with.


Rasputin behaved like the shrewd pea-
sant he was, a man with hypnotic blue
Les, a soothing, healing touch, a zest
J r women, song, and dance, and
nature at once perceptive, lustful,
n tle and superbly self-confident but
which did not bloom until well after
marriage, children, and years of pilgrim-
style wanderings, in his 33 rd year.
The haemophilic son and heir of the
anguished Imperial couple was the
cause for Rasputin’s entrance into their
intimate life, for the distressed parents,
aware the medical profession was help-
less in the face of the disease, sought
out miracle workers and quacks.
Their desperation led them to try
anything and everything to cure the
child. Rasputin’s story-telling, know-
ledgable touch, magnificent eyes, and
tremendous physique combined to in
spire friendship and confidence in the
young Tsarevitch, and Rasputin became
the only one who could—however im-
permanently —stop the painful internal
bleedings.
Made a scapegoat by the revolu-
tionaries of 1917 in order to convince
the Russian masses of the corruption
and incompetence of the Court, Ras-
putin’s true and beneficial role remains
largely unknown. Moving from personal
dedsions in the Imperial couple’s daily
life and taking on political decisions,
his innate commonsense slowly brought
the decrepit Russian political system
into workability. Whenever the Tsar
disobeyed his injunctions, both in peace
time and in the conduct of the war,
disaster followed and Rasputin’s original
advice was time after time proved cor-
rect.
Undeniably his modest flat was at
once the centre of countless seductions
of pretty women, most of them more
than willing and quite ready to believe
this “purified” as well as pleasured
them, and served also as a broker’s
office where complex financial transac-
tions on a monumental scale were car-
ried out by his four excellent secretaries
without the usual bureaucratic hin-
drance of red tape. Accumulating a vast
fortune which he never bothered to esti-
mate, Rasputin gave away tremendous
sums of money to the deserving, as well
as selling privileges and contracts, for a
high price, to those he considered suit-
able.
His prediction that the Imperial
family would not survive his own death
hy six months did nothing to deter a
wealthy member of the Russian nobility
an d his high-born companions from
murdering the Siberian holy man.
Handsome young Prince Felix Yusu-
P°v, well liked and trusted by Ras-
putin, who enjoyed his guitar-playing
an d gipsy songs, had no trouble in
flicking him to a brutal death.
Rene Fulop Miller was in the unique
Position of having access to pertinent
Papers and documents, and conversa-
tions with relevant people. From this he
produced an exciting and memor-
able book.
The Jacobeans
By R. G. HOWARD
The Bodley Head Henry James. Volume
One: The Europeans and Washing-
ton Square. Volume Two: The Awk-
ward Age. The Bodley Head. $4.80.
THE ESSENCE of the later James
lies in his use of dialogue. One tends
to remember conversations in his last
novels as restful glades in the forest of
painstaking analysis, but they are more
than restful, more even than witty and
polished. Quite often they carry the
action to its most crucial stages.
Typically they involve only two
characters, supersensitive individuals
well equipped to detect the most infini-
tesimal change of mood, the most subtle
nuance, and having the leisure to apply
this talent. Jamesian characters have an
insatiable curiosity about the attitudes
and motives of each other, either from
pure inquisitiveness or from self-
interest or from delicacy of feeling and
consideration. But whatever the motive,
they seem to be forever playing a game
in which one character has to draw out
another.
By the unwritten rules, all questions
must be answered, but it is quite per-
missible to make the answers as
ambiguous as possible. Conversations
thus acquire an inimitably teasing
quality, as the interrogator now falls
behind his companion and has to ask
for elucidation, now rushes ahead with
an anticipatory query. Words are con-
stantly echoed —in wonder or in con-
firmation. Pronouns are used with a
seemingly deliberate vagueness that
invariably requires clarification.
The result is rather absurd but fas-
cinating. “We’re always discussing each
other,” says Nanda in “The Awkward
Age,” referring to her mother’s circle,
but the comment applies to most
Jamesian groups.
Much of this is not so evident in the
two early novellas as it is in “The
Awkward Age,” but although twenty
years separate them, many other aspects
of the dialogue are common to both
periods. Thus conversation is limited
on the one hand to a refined form of
gossip-mongering, on the other to a
conscientious worrying over behaviour
small talk has no place in the
Jamesian drawing-room. And in the
earlier works, the language of the
characters already has the characteristic
wit and elegance.
“Washington Square,” perhaps the
best known of James’ works, seems
quite perfect in its way, and one might
be amazed that he had achieved per-
fection so early in his career —but for
the fact that it does not strike very
deep. The characters and the situations
are all out of the stock-pot, and it is
purely the felicity of James’ style that
gives them conviction.
“The Europeans” is more interesting
because it does attempt to go a little
deeper, and, revealing that James is
not yet a master, comes to grief. The
first half, which consists of a series of
urbane dialogues in the manner James
had already perfected, with the “Euro-
pean” brother and sister insinuating
themselves into the bosom of their rich
American cousins, is faultless. When
the fortune-hunting siblings narrow
their sights on two characters whom
James has made more complex than
the others, the scenes that follow de-
mand the sort of subtly probing con-
versations that are a feature of his
later works but which he was not yet
capable of writing. He has to fall back
on melodrama as a result and two
or three important scenes become quite
laughable.
Already in these two novellas dia-
logue characteristically takes place on a
bare stage which is gradually and
partially filled one by one with objects
produced by an invisible prop man
each time a pause in the conversation
requires one of the actors to let his
eye fall on something. To put it an-
other way, the environment comes into
existence by degrees only as it is in-
volved in the action. In this way and
by eliminating all small talk, James
gives his dialogue a peculiar intensity
that is part of its fascination.
Dialogue forms the greater part of
both “The Europeans” and “Washing-
ton Square,” but in “The Awkward
Age” it excludes all else. In this novel
James made a daring experiment that
came off superbly. It reads like a play,
even to the extent that exits and en-
trances are timed with all the im-
probable convenience of stage move-
ments.
Nevertheless, this is no play. With
his emphasis on dialogue one might
have thought James would write good
plays, but in fact his efforts in this
direction were by common consent
failures. The reason no doubt lies in
the extremely slow pace he needs for
the proper development of his dramas,
for the gradual awakening of scruples,
the microscopic conflict between im-
pulses. It is not until half-way through
“The Awkward Age,” for instance, that
the “situation” becomes apparent.
That situation is pure James. It
centres on Nanda Brookenham and
the eligible but impecunious man she
loves. Mr. Longdon, who sees in the
young couple’s relationship a re-enact-
ment of his own love for Nanda’s
grandmother, puts it to Vanderbank
that if he marries Nanda he (Long-
don) will settle a large amount of
money on her. He imagines that he
is there—by removing the only obstacle
in the way of the young couple’s happy
union. But Van, to his surprise, can-
not make up his mind to accept the
offer.
The reasons for his hesitation are
never really elucidated, for, everyone
having too large a stake in his decision,
the usual game is abandoned, and no
questions are asked, no answers given.
Perhaps the marriage was too crudely
opportunistic for his sensibilities; per-
haps he found Nanda tainted by the


corrupt influence of her mother’s circle.
In any case, poor Nanda is seemingly
left in the end to endure a wealthy but
lonely life .as unattractive as that of
Catherine Sloper in “Washington
Square.”
Scene after scene is brilliantly written
in this superb novel, but undoubtedly
the finest, as James himself thought, is
that in which Mr. Longdon makes his
offer to Van. James has many virtues
(not the least of which is his handling
of comic scenes, for instance, the hilari-
ous interview between Morris Townsend
and Mrs. Penniman in the oyster
saloon), but it is in these long, elabor-
ate, oblique dialogues that he is at
his best—this communication between
unusually sensitive people, with, for the
reader, the dawning realisation of
motives, the slow and beautiful unfold-
ing of moral implications.
A German Twain
By VICTORIA WOODBERRY
Absent Without Leave. Heinrich 8011.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $3.85.
HEINRICH BOLL is one of post-war
Germany’s leading novelists. He has
consistently headed the best-seller lists
and is probably the most treasured
“house-author” of Patrick White’s
Cologne publishers, Kiepenheuer and
Witsch. Some years back he even trans-
lated “The Tree of Man” for them
(with some predictable howlers, especi-
ally with Australian colloquialisms).
These two novellas and 18 short
stories are good examples of his work:
deeply ironic even when apparently
most guileless and garrulous, German
in the best sense, liberal-minded, reli-
gious by conviction but committed
against bigotry. The same ingredients
are to be found here as in his famous
novel “The Clown,” which caused an
internal uproar in German Roman
Catholic circles. As only a real believer
can, he is not slow at pointing out the
raw spots and the need for reform
within the Church. His writing is much
easier to read than that of Guenther
Grass, and he never indulges in shocks
through the use of sacrilege as in
Grass’ “The Tin Drum.” When, for
example, 801 l refers to a row of saints
rather the worse for wear one can see
as much or as little into his meaning as
one wishes.
This is, most probably, the reason
for his popularity. The readers can get
quite literally whatever he chooses out
of any of these stories. On the surface
level they are entertaining and funny.
One need look no further.
“Absent Without Leave” and “Enter
and Exit,” the two novellas, sum up
the atmosphere of Germany during and
after the war through the first-person
narrative of a most unwilling soldier.
The matter-of-fact acceptance of a
world turned upside down, the ridicu-
lous barbarism of organised butchery,
and the ephemeral nature of values
are told with a quiet, effective sense of
the absurd. At the end, the author has
obligingly added an “Interpretation,” a
satirical key to any suspected symbolism
in the story: e.g., (a) “The three
(white) officers’ handkerchiefs given to
the nuns are transmuted lilies, like the
one found in front of the altars of St.
Joseph, the Blessed Virgin, and virgin
saints in general,” right down to (e)
“The narrator is concealing something.
What?”
He often reads like a Germanic
Twain: his ironic comments on the
universal thirst for a surfeit of wrapping
paper in “The Thrower-Away” recalls
Twain’s own comments on the over-
abundance of the German language. In
this story he even excuses book re-
viewers who criticise books they have
not read on the valid (sic) grounds that
books are usually so securely wrapped,
gummed, and tied with twisted wire
before being submitted to the post that
it is clearly beyond a critic’s capabilities
ever to get them undone. In many cases
he adroitly presents the weird idiosyn-
crasies of his fellow-men not as the
faults they are but as charming q u ; r i
of personality. There is no surer ro j
to flattery, or success.
“Murke’s Collected Silences” J s
gem of unheard laughter, in which one
immediately recognises the authentic
aroma of those little hives of true
democracy, the post-war German radio
stations, from the terrifying daily
ascent in the “Paternoster” ( o p er j
fronted, continuous lifts) to the over-
intelligent young men of the Cultural
Department. After days of ham-orators
and official cacophony, young Herr
Murke is only too happy to collect a
tape of “silences.” When the author
Bur-Malottke, the string-pulling, con-
verted Catholic of that convenient year
1945, father of “numerous books of a
belletristic - philosophical - religious and
art-historical nature” decides to cut the
word “God” from his already recorded
talks on “The Nature of Art” and sub-
stitute “That higher Being Whom we
revere” instead, Murke has a field day.
Moreover, the radio does not allow
“God” to go to waste: the cut bits are
inserted into a play about an atheist.
Cemetery
Climbing the lichen-bearded fences
And balancing their back to the tombs,
The children resentfully sentenced,
Suffering the afternoon
In the straight-laced cypress silence,
Watched through weighted hours
Pale hands of women
Floating over the graves,
Arranging the frail, cut flowers
In the glistening sea-blue day.
Long into the afternoon,
That lengthened down the paths
And weathered epitaphs,
The women wistfully calling
To the children wandering away
Went on absently moving the vases
Or pulling at small green weeds,
Speaking in nods and whispers
That travelled timelessly over
The fields of memories.
Till the children, truant together,
Made ships of the tombs, explored land
Stone deaf to the women’s cries;
Let life call their names, let her hold them
In the pulse of her sun-drenched hand.

LETTERS
Vietnam line
«g un t the Victorian ALP’s State
executive” is one of the favorite games
0 f political roundsmen. The Press’
ma in quarrel is with the Victorian
executive’s role in sustaining policies—
above all on Vietnam—unacceptable
to it. However, within the Victorian
branch itself are critics who, while
they assail the executive on the ground
of its bureaucratic style of work, would
he appalled to think they were contri-
buting to its replacement by one with
a Vietnam line only marginally different
from the Liberal Party’s.
A major defect of the case made
against the Victorian executive on the
grounds of bureaucratic style is that
alleged Victorian shortcomings are
never examined alongside those of other
States. This way they appear blacker
and can be laid at the door of the
Left Wing, who control the Victorian
State executive. For example, Mr. Race
Mathews writes of “Victoria’s un-
enviable record of declining member-
ship, repeated electoral disasters, failure
to modernise outdated organisational
structures.” (“Overland” 35, page 28.)
Mr. Mathews shows no awareness that
the N.S.W. branch, for example, is
suffering acutely from the first malaise
and he forgets the electoral setbacks
in N.S.W., 1963-66. Hence the problems
are clearly not peculiar to Victoria, and
cannot, as Mr. Mathews would have
it, be laid at the door of what he
describes as “a group of trade unionists
noisily dedicated to socialism.”
In respect to the third problem
cited, Victoria, with its energetic and
well-staffed policy committees, is far
ahead of N.S.W. On Victoria’s 30-odd
policy committees, one can find dissi-
dent intellectuals, branch members,
and specialists. Yet the findings of the
committees, such as those on social
services, health, transport, civil
liberties, law reform, were accepted
substantially unchanged by annual con-
ferences in 1965 and 1966, and Victoria
has produced the best education policy
document of any State.
In the case of the foreign-affairs-
eommittee recommendations on con-
frontation between Indonesia and
Malaysia, recommendations which con-
flicted squarely with the views of the
executive were accepted by conference.
% contrast, specialists and academics
°f any sort are notoriously absent from
the standing-policy committees of
N.S.W., let alone those known to be
dissidents.
ht is not that the Victorian critics
always confine themselves to Victoria.
n “Labor Comment,” June, 1966, for
example, statistics from all States are
used in a comparison of branch-union
representation at annual conferences.
But the frame of reference shrinks to
Victoria alone when it comes to branch
membership, electoral decline, etc.
Victorian critics of the Victorian
central executive further weaken their
case by refusal to give credit where it
is due. Branch life is depicted as con-
sistently dull and lacking vigorous
political debate. In many cases this
is not true. The official Victorian
branch newspaper, “Fact,” is better
than critics will concede, and compares
more than favorably with the banal
N.S.W. branch publication, and fairly
well with Queensland’s “New Age.”
During the recent Victorian State elec-
tions, the Victorian central executive
published constructive policy statements
on education (“A Plan for Education
in Victoria”), science (“Science and
Society”), town planning (“The Role
of Town Planning”). In the branch’s
TV and radio publicity, young and
talented people have been drawn in.
ALP Federal policy on Vietnam
would almost certainly swing closer to
Liberal policy if the Victorian central
executive were overturned. Some prob-
able consequences can be spelt out.
The Holt administration may reason-
ably be assumed to have no great
desire to substantially increase our Viet-
nam commitment, as it is potentially
an explosive electoral issue. But if
Labor adopts an essentially bi-partisan
approach on Vietnam, then the Gov-
ernment can no longer offer America
the excuse that the Labor Party, with
over 40 percent of the vote, is too in-
transigent. Nor, if it adopted the Right-
wing line on Vietnam, would Labor
have valid grounds to oppose an in-
crease in our Vietnam commitment if
it became the Government. Yet any
substantial increase would seriously
undermine Labor’s ability to enact its
excellent social services program. Just
as America’s “Great Society” has been
suspended because of escalation in Viet-
nam, so we could write off hopes of
worth-while improvement in social ser-
vices.
The style of work of the Victorian
ALP central executive undoubtedly con-
tains many unsatisfactory features, and
some of these can be traced to structural
as well as administrative shortcomings.
But in a political party, politics and
policy are paramount, style secondary.
And if similar, though often more
severe, reproaches can be levelled
against other branches in matters of
work style, the question arises: why
has the Victorian central executive been
singled out? It has been singled out be-
cause of its policy, in particular its
Vietnam policy.
Those in the Victorian ALP who
endorse this and other progressive
policies, and wish to see these advanced
by a flexible and responsive leadership,
need to be aware of the danger of
their criticisms being used to place in
office an alternative leadership whose
style of work could well be more
bureaucratic and whose policies would
be infinitely less desirable.

Hard to get?
Ross Campbell’s marginal comments
on “A Man For All Seasons” contain
many statements as bold and as sweep-
ing as those he criticises. For example,
he says Anne Boleyn played hard-to-
get. By way of comment I quote the
following dates:
25th January, 1533. Secretly married
— Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn,
May, 1533. Decree of Nullity — not
divorce — of Henry’s first marriage.
7th September, 1533. Birth of Eliza-
beth I.
These dates cast doubts on the im-
plication of virginity contained in the
pre-marital 'letter Campbell quotes.
Could he supply the date of the letter?

Anglican pilgrim
Those of us who live in other Anglican
theological colleges in Australia
may perhaps be forgiven a partisan
giggle over the “New Pilgrim’s Pro-
gress” of the seemingly pseudonymous
Dick Hooker (8., June 3). Since the
college described is, to the knowing,
recognisable despite the exaggeration
necessary for clever caricature which
the piece undoubtedly is the rest
of us may well take comfort that at
least we don’t have that kind of atmos-

characteristically find the fault in
faculty, fellow students, bishops, or the
Church at large; seldom in them-
selves.
It should also be noted that, when
one diocese or college proves uncon-
genial, Anglicanism provides sufficient
variety of expression for one with a
compelling sense of vocation to find
elsewhere nearby a setting in which he
can work and grow usefully.
Men with Dick Hooker’s sense of
humor are always valuable in the
ordained ministry; but, if they cannot
also- bring with them or learn along
the way other, profounder attitudes of
response to human conditions, indeed
they will not be missed.

The Catholic crisis
A summary indication of what Vatican
II said in the Decree on the Ministry
and Life of Priests, section 16, shows
that Peter Gough’s description of its
statement on clerical celibacy as a “run
for cover” (8., May 27) is, to use his
own words, “anything but fair treat-
ment.”
The Decree explicity recognises that
celibacy is not required by the very
nature of the priesthood, but is a
Church law imposed in the West. A
different discipline prevails in the East,
where there is both a celibate and a
married clergy. (The prominence given
to Father McMahon’s comments on this
point might lead the unwary reader to
believe that this distinction was pre-
viously unknown.)
To show how celibacy harmonises
with the priesthood, the Council lists
a number of reasons which refer its
origin to the teaching of Christ and
the Apostles. For example, celibacy is
undertaken for the sake of the kingdom
of heaven; it allows a priest to serve
God more easily with undivided heart
and to minister more freely to his fellow
men; it is a sign to believers of the
future life in which the children of the
resurrection will neither marry nor take
wives. In other words, celibacy is a
spiritual value intelligible within the
context of Christian revelation. It is
not just a pastoral necessity.

The current crisis in the Catholic
Church, is naturally of great news value.
Peter Gough’s article on the subject fails
to give a balanced view, saturated as
it is with such emotionally laden terms
as “errant schoolboy,” “weary old
disease of paternalism,” and “academic
bullying,” etc. What could have been a
very good report lost much merit by its
exaggerations and vague generalisation
I suppose I’m not really competent 7
challenge Mr. Gough’s statistics, but if
as he says, two-thirds of Catholic’
ignore the teaching of the Church on
birth-control I can only conclude th
I must happen to live in an area with
a heavy concentration of the remaining
third. There is much that is good i
Mr. Gough’s assessment of the Catholic
world, but to accept his views at their
face value is to see the crisis through
the eyes of an “angry young ma ,j»
Time will always show the deficiencies
of such a viewpoint.
Fr . R. J. EGAR
Brighton (S.A.).
Mr. Gough is incorrect in stating (B
May 27) that the archdiocese of Mel-
bourne “has the same number of semi-
narians as 20 years ago; yet the Catholic
population of the archdiocese has
doubled over the past two decades.”
According to the records here, the
Melbourne archdiocese had 65 students
in this college at the beginning of 1947-
at the beginning of this year," the Mel-
bourne archdiocese had 140 students
in the two sections of this college.
He also errs, at least with regard to
the Melbourne archdiocese, in his re-
mark that “since the beginning of the
19605, there has been, without any fore-
warning, a notable decline in applica-
tions for entry to the seminaries.”
Entries for Melbourne from 1952 to
1959 were respectively 16, 19, 16, 18,
24, 31, 24, and 19; entries for Mel-
bourne from 1960 to 1967 have been
21, 24, 27, 29, 24, 19, 16, and 25.
Of course, considering the great de-
mand for priestly services, the archdio-
cese of Melbourne could do with more
seminarians, but the above figures show
that this is a problem, not a crisis. And
it is a problem which is being tackled,
together with the general problem of
implementing the decrees of the Second
Vatican Council.
In a time of change, disagreements
about pace and direction are inevitable.
Change in the Australian church is
coming gradually. While some of the
clergy may, for all I know, be reach-
ing for the “panic” button, the vast
majority seem to be coping pretty well.

RAAF thesis
I am writing a thesis on “Educa-
tion and Training in the RAAF, 1939-
1945,” and should like to enlist the
assistance of your readers, who might:
lend me any documents relating to the
subject; provide me with an account,
of say 500 words, of their wartime
careers in RAAF education and/or
training, and of the problems they
encountered; and offer me any advice
they may think helpful.
