To sentenced beggar and erring Earl,
Unhappy the sound of the bagpipes skirl;
Remorseless the tick of the Tolbooth clock;
In dreary cell or on headsman’s block,
Time ceased for them.
Original Pent Copyright by K'. D. & H. O. tVUU,
Capstan Clock Series
No. 6
The Tolbooth in The Canongate, Edhv-
burgh, Scotland, with its projecting
clock, was built in 1591 as a jail and
court house. Countless prisoners, humble
and of high degree, have climbed its
stairs to their doom.
One of the most famous personages who
met his death there was the Marquis of
Montrose. In 1650, he invaded Scotland
on behalf of the Stuarts, but was de-
feated, captured, condemned and carried
in a cart through the streets of Edin-
burgh to the Tolbooth, amid all the in-
sults that the cruelty of the covenanting
rabble cd'uld devise.
The Tolbooth is now used as a reading
room. Over the door is the motto “pro
patria et posteris”
In our more humane and enlightened
era, the passage of time has a
pleasanter meaning Time for a
Capstan .

HIS BOOKS
The Tourist Novel
Romances such as The Captain Hates
the Sea and Via Panama (7s. 6d. each,
and published by Heinemann and Ham-
ish Hamilton Respectively) are the corol-
laries of “Imperial Palace,” “Grand
Hotel ’ and the like. Taxation is making
it so expensive to live on shore that thou-
sands are spending a considerable part
of every year at sea aboard liners which
range, as regards comfort and price, from
British railway hotels to Continental
Ritz-Astors. When the novel of ship-
board life is efficiently done it interprets
situations which most travellers have
been faced with, and it is colorful by
reason of the changing scenes and the
mostly antipathetic characters who are
brought together on liners. Writers in
this genre have a completely free hand ;
they can assemble all the freaks they
have ever met or imagined without detri-
ment to plausibility. Both these authors
have got their most dramatic effects on
such lines, particularly Mr. Wallace
Smith.
A Movie Plot
The Captain Hates the Sea has an odd
resemblance in treatment to “Vile
Bodies.” Wallace Smith is an American,
and his chief characters are Americans ;
yet his world is the same as Evelyn
Waugh’s under its skin. The inhabitants
are amoral, and he views their behavior
with cynical tolerance. Man was born
to dipsomania, promiscuity, obscene
language and ultimate ruin, physical and
spiritual, he seems to say. There is noth-
ing to worry about; on the contrary the
spectacle is comic if viewed with the
detachment of one who recognises no
social or ethical principles.
The hero is Steve Bramley, an alco-
holic journalist, who reels up the gang-
way of the San Capador in San Pedro
Harbor. He has been living with a
movie star, and is abandoning her for
her own good. Steve doesn’t get really
sober for the rest of the trip. The purser,
who also makes a hobby of liquor, is an
old friend ; so is the detective, Schulte,
who is after Checkett, a crook. Others on
the passenger-list are Mrs. Magruder
(rich, elderly, a friend of all good
drinkers); Judge Griswold and his wife
(repellently righteous); a millionaire and
the lady for whose sake he means to
divorce his wife ; the wife and the young
man who loves her ; Janet Grayson (a
mystery girl during the earlier stages of
the story) and Major Waringforth
(comic Englishman and villain). General
Salazaro is on his way to Mazapulco to
start a revolution. A genial little man,
with considerable gifts as an alcohol-
ist, he tells Steve many stirring tales of
the executions he has directed. As the
San Capador is moving out of Maza-
pulco Harbor the sound of a volley
reaches the deck. Doctor Spurtelle (a de-
mented missionary) hurries aboard with
the news that the general has been exe-
cuted. At Bacanegra the blue-ticket girl
arrives. The purser explains:
“The military authorities give ’em a
blue ticket when they do something un-
moral. And they take this ticket and go
back where they came from.”
“I think he means they’re deported,”
Steve said.
“Jolly good scheme, too,” said the
major. “Do it all the time in our colonial
service. No British subject is allowed to
be a tart. Won’t tolerate it a gory minute.
Pride of Empire and all that sort of thing.
Morale, prestige. That sort of thing,
what?”
The blue-ticket girl is intended to be
an important figure, but the book falls
off after her arrival, and she is largely
responsible. Evelyn Waugh would never
have been guilty of a creation so con-
ventionally melodramatic. The major is
also a feeble effort; but then Americans
would no doubt say the same of the
Judge in “Vile Bodies.” American
writers, however quick their ears may
be to catch the nuances of phrasing and
intonation, invariably make caricatures
of Englishmen ; and Americans say that
the Yanks of British writers are prepos-
terous.
The Captain
Hates the Sea, in
addition to a
large gallery of
picturesque de-
generates and a
quantity of dia-
logue which is highly amusing in its
ribald way, has an exciting plot, and an
ending in the disillusioned Waugh
manner. Steve lurches down the gang-
way at New York as drunk as he was
when he ascended it at San Pedro.
A car was waiting. It was a long town
car, done in lavender and chromium. At
its wheel was a negro, also done in
lavender, a shade deeper, with chromium
buttons. A young woman, incredibly
blonde and incredibly beautiful, was look-
ing from the window.
‘Thank Christ!” said Steve. “Gert.”
He started towards the car.
Realism
Via f^ a , is less movified, more
naturalistic. It describes a journey from
Southampton to Wellington (M.L.). Miss
Jepson doesn’t rage against humanity.
On the contrary' she is a sociological
optimist; yet she has a singularly pene-
trating eye for the weaknesses of average
people. The passengers who join the
Taipo in England seem dull at first, but,
of course, they are nothing of the sort.
No human beings are dull in the right
hands.
Clara Campion—prim, repressed,
on the vergfe of saying good-bye to
youth—accidentally bumps Dr. Blood-
well. She is appalled to hear him say to
his wife “Why the devil did you stop
on the gangway like that? Some
damned tart gave me a jab in the back
with a suitcase! ” Little does Miss Cam-
pion think, while agonising over the
doctor’s coarseness, that he and she will
have a brief, frustrated love affair.
Lovely Elizabeth Hammond is happily
married to her professor. Little does she
think when she first looks across the
dining-saloon and catches the eye of young
Olifant that she will develop a violent
infatuation for him —one of those ship-
board infatuations which lead to noth-
ing, and are shaken off a few days after
the journey ends. Bloodwell is an
achievement—a large, earthy, vital man ;
no intellectual; a retailer of spicy stories
which the males whose society he prefers
to that of his wife receive with delight.
But deadly serious about one thing—his
profession. You have a poorish opinion
of him till he performs his rush opera-
tion, assisted by the incompetent ship’s
doctor.
The most conspicuous oddity is
Verona Reid, whom Bloodwell diag-
noses on sight as an advanced case of
Addison’s disease. Verona is responsible
for the only crime. The others are the
kind of people who always appear on
passenger-ships—the young man who
takes charge of the deck sports; the
drunk whom the barman is Ordered not
to serve ; the girl whose conduct on the
boat-deck and elsewhere scandalises the
respectable.
An admirable feature of this novel is
the art with which the successive atmo-
spheres are conveyed. The passengers
begin by hating the look of one another ;
then they get curious, then friendly. Dis-
likes and disappointments supervene, and
as the last port approaches practically
all have but one wish—to see the last of
one another. It is the history of every
voyage since sea-voyaging began. Other
features are the feminine yet dry and, in
places, biting humor, and the writing.
Above all, the writing. Nothing over-
stated, never a word too much. It' makes
Via Panama delightfully easy to read.

“Marseilles,” by Will Ashton, R. 0.1,


their beauty. Beauty is her touchstone,
the beauty of all undying things, great or
small:
....That kindred thing, the sound of a
rider’s foot coming into the house, the
jingle of the spurs on his feet, the dry,
warm “run” of the stockwhip trailing
from his arm. Nor is it that other part
of the camper’s outfit —the hobbles. Again
l hear out of years of distance the sound
of hobbles in the night; of hobbles on a
horse just turned out to graze; of hobbles,
chink, chink, chink on a saddle —going
east, going west, going north, the cattle
lowing, the goldfields calling....
It is not a representative quotation —
in work of this close-knit quality one
needs half the book to demonstrate a
fair sample—but it has Mary Gilmore’s
spare, clean-cut vividness and her charm.
Mr. Timms makes history, too —Aus-
tralian publishing history. His Conflict
(Angus and Robertson ; 65.) is the first
powder-and-patches historical novel by
an Australian author to be published by
an Australian firm and to achieve simul-
taneous publication in London, New
York and Sydney.
Seventeenth-century London, Paris,
Marseilles, Nice and the Mediterranean
have been stood on tiptoe, so to speak,
to provide a long, exciting story. A
pirate fleet, a massacre, the plague,
treachery in the palace of the king, a
conscienceless siren, a heroic spy,
hunger, the extreme of luxury, a burning
prison, a tender, really moving love story
—all these and more move across the
author’s huge canvas. He writes with
vigor and precision, with a firm down-
right aplomb eminently suited to his
dramatic matter. It is melodrama ; but
it was easy for the present reviewer to
become lost in the sweep of the tale, to
turn hungrily from chapter to chapter,
and to regret the reaching of the last
of, the 400 pages.
In Winds of Heaven (Jarrolds ; 7s. 6d.)
Nelle M. Scanlan completes her Maori-
land saga of the Pencarrow family. As
in “Pencarrow” and “Tides of Youth”
she wastes no time on decoration. The
large group of three generations are all
alive, all act and react with a realism
which hardly ever descends to mere
drama. In this third and last book, the
Kelly Pencarrows go through the post-
war prosperity to the world depression
and the usual crash, and finally recon-
struct with the Pencarrow pioneering
blood as almost their sole equipment. It
is a good story, harsh and luminous in
its simplicity aitd sincerity. At times it
is heroic.
HILARY LOFTING.
John Shaw Neilson
O Heart of Spring!
Spirit of light and love and joyous day
So soon to faint beneath the fiery summer:
Still smiles the Earth, eager for thee alway.
I had read this much aloud when my
companion took up the refrain:
Welcome art thou, so ever short thy stay,
Thou bold, thou blithe newcomer!
Then, joining voices, we asked:
Whither, oh whither, this thy journeying,
O Heart of Spring!
Dark afternoon covered the window
to the room we sat in ; and, while ashes
fluttered on the hearth, we spoke of
someone gone: the old man who had
loved Australia ; who had done so much
for her poetic kinsmen; guiding them
upward, and teaching them their songs.
A. G. Stephens, with need for happi-
ness, looked upon Shaw Neilson, not as
mortal being, but as angel from on
high. Vance Palmer told me he saw
Stephens, crying, with these poems in
his hand.
R. A. Croll, editor of Collected Poems
of John Shaw Neilson (Lothian;
10s. 6d.), says in a preface that A.G.S.
had courage “to back an unknown
writer.” In fact, Stephens had come,
unaware, upon a pearl of great price ;
and got himself kudos declaring the find.
Croll says further that Stephens “was
bold enough, in very early days, to
acclaim John Shaw Neilson as ‘first of
Australian poets.’ ” That represents
Stephens’s opinion ; and what he thought
he always said. Nevertheless, many
songsters, yet unfledged, remain in our
furrows; and, of late years, we have
watched larks rise, and heard them sing.
I can pick some, by cunning of my ear:
this one is sweet; that is robust; each
has its separate value ; and poetry isn’t
competitive, any more than the sun or
the wind.
In this volume I lean towards the first,
finding their goodness distilled from the
heart; acknowledging the glamor of the
line where he tells of
“....undelivered lovers, half awake.”
Again I turn to my companion at the
fireside; and I read to her:
Speak not of Death: it is a merry morn:
A glittering bird has danced into a tree:
She replies:
From his abundant heart bravely are borne
The love of leafy choristers to me.
The words approximate the voice of
nature. Yet Neilson can be cloying;
and some of his work is monotonous. In
fact, there are a couple of Neilsons ; so
that out of his present book it is pos-
sible to make two: one of which might
be treasured for ever; while the other
is—not so good.
HUGH MCCRAE.
A Banned Novel
Norman Lindsay’s The Cautious
Amorist arrived out of the blue the
other day. G. W. R. Southern claims
in his “Making Morality Modern” that
the Postal Department “has no power
to refuse transmission provided a book
is sealed and prepaid as a letter.” Mr.
Southern’s work is available to anyone
who sends him a 10s. subscription to
the World League for Sexual Reform,
and it may be that the Customs censor-
ship is vulnerable on similar lines. Any-
how, here The Cautious Amorist is, pro-
fusely illustrated by the author and pub-
lished by T. Werner Laurie at 7s. 6d.
It doesn’t pretend to be heavyweight
literature ; it contains no new message.
On the other hand, there are four
sharply-defined characters and plenty of
loud laughs. The s.s. Minorca is wrecked,
and Miss Sadie Patch, the Rev. Fletcher
Gibble, James Carrol and Patrick
Plunket, stoker, reach a desert island.
Each of the men reacts to the presence
of the buxom, hard-boiled Sydney lass
in his own way. The stoker is a brawny,
combative profligate; the clergyman is
diffident, idealistic, a purveyor of pulpit
bromides ; Carrol is an embittered lad
with a grievance against life.
We have no such thing as happiness.
We have just enough release from suffering
to allow us to stand it. Of course, there
are one or two things worth having;
tobacco and girls and —yes, I’ll admit one
almost perfect ingredient—getting drunk
with a cheerful group of idiots.
Sadie is faced with the problem of
handling the males to her best advan-
tage, and she is just the kind of girl to
make a success of it. The end is a
wicked anti-climax: she gets off with a
junior officer of the ship that rescues
them. The dialogue is consistently in
character, and practically the whole story
is in dialogue.
Why this novel should have been
banned is a mystery, explicable only on
the ground that our censors are so busy
examining the works of Norman Lindsay
and two or three other celebrities that
they have no time to read anything else.
Books which are far more censorable in
the pre-war sense pour into The Bulle-
tin office from England and the U.S.A.,
and most of them can be bought at any
big bookshop.
D.
Modernism
The handicap in every age of the poet
who tries to interpret the spirit of that
age is the critics’ habit of looking back-
wards. Thus many modern critics are
rudely jarred by forms which may be a
perfectly appropriate rendering of
present-day moods. They see life as the
Victorians did. The vast, colorful
panorama of Wagner, gaudy and re-
splendent, matched jingoism and over-
furnished rooms. The sentiment of
Tennyson and Dickens at their worst
touched the heart of the Victorian middle
class as did Carlyle’s melodramatic out-
bursts.
The spirit of to-day is being probed
by novelists and twisted by psychologists,
and representative poetry, such as it is, is
a phantasmagoria of chaos. In T. S.
Eliot we have a brain speeded up by
modern environment, torn by the in-
creasing pandemonium of human exist-
ence since 1914 until it dances in a maze
of erratic figures like a molecule in
matter. The modern is without form,
chaotic as the confusion of thought of
our day ; grimly caricaturist like a cubist
painting, yet more real, more direct, more
pointed than the ethereal reality of the
egoist Shelley.
The poetry of the past was the poetry
of leisure, and the day of mental leisure
is over. The poets themselves are men
who see the chaos of the world; its
misery is no longer muffled, but blared
forth. It is a drifting world, losing its
grip on religion and faith. How can its
thought be forced into a sonnet, into
rhymed couplets or be chained by blank
verse? Life has become too real for
artificial lyrics about a sunset. The
meaning of the sunset has changed. To
the complacent it was a glory ; to the
feeling it is the flaming ruin of a world.
It is the thought and the idea that
make writing poetic, not the form. And
when the idea is real and living the form
must follow the dictates of the theme and
not be strangled in a worn-out shell. We
have been crippled and hobbled by
poetic ideals which, like “a dead hand,”
are holding back the fulfilment of living
needs.
J. H. S.
A Satchel of Books
The Home for this month has no out-
standing feature, but it’s a fine all-round
issue. “Some Picturesque Rascals,” by
C. H. Bertie, begins with Sir Henry
Brown Hayes, the Irish convict-baronet
who built Vaucluse House. He was
worth more space. As usual, the advts.
are so beautifully reproduced that it is
hard to distinguish them from the con-
tributions, and there is an attractive
cover by Adrian Feint.
Dr. Pethwick in C. S. Forester’s The
Peacemaker (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.) is
science master at a third-rate school and
a mathematical genius. He discovers a
way to demagnetise all magnets within
a given radius. His character, ideals and
appalling wife, and his brief love affair
with the headmaster’s daughter, all impel
him to use his portentous discovery as
he does in the story. A most impressive
thriller.
Cossack Girl, by Marina Yurlova
(Cassell; Angus and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.).
The fair-minded critic can say nothing
against this account of a beautiful girl’s
experiences in the Russian Army between
the beginning of the war and the revolu-
tion, except that he doesn’t believe a
word of it. A present-day photograph of
Marina reveals her as the possessor of
a face that a movie exotic might envy,
and she looks even more alluring in her
uniform. She claims to have fought and
lived side by side with some of the most
degraded humans on any of the fronts,
and to have emerged morally unscathed.
The hideousness of the story is matched
by some of the photographs (e.g., “An
Execution in Kazan”), and in other
respects it suggests a work of imagina-
tion by a first-class writer who may or
may not be Miss Yurlova. It is the
choice of one of the Book Guilds or
Clubs which London has been proliferat-
ing for some years past.
A. J. Cotton is one of those incurable
optimists who abound in the Australian
pastoral industry and need all their opti-
mism. His With the Big Herds in Aus-
tralia (Angus and Robertson, Sydney ;
125.) is a bright if sketchy story of his
life from the time he joined the merchant
service as an apprentice until the day he
had his first taste of bush life with the
Dangars of Yallaroi. “Colonial experi-
ence” at Yallaroi, a long course of droving
—which he recommends to all intending
pastoralists as an essential grounding for
the job before them —and various station
jobs in Queensland led up to his career
as a small station-owner and a cattle-
dealer on a gradually increasing scale.
He found good friends in the banks, and
more than one prominent pastoralist of
the day helped him. He was one of the
pioneers of meat-preserving and -freezing
in North Queensland, and found time
during the South African war to make a
small fortune out of army remounts. In
due course he became part owner, with
the Whites, of Brunette Downs, the vast
N.T. cattle station which has had so
much publicity of late years because
overseas ’planes use its ’drome for a
stopping place. On his own showing
Cotton came out of it all minus most of
his possessions at one stage, but he has,
apparently, contrived to rise again. A
breezy, sociable soul and a born
gambler in stock and stations, “A.J.’s”
book is a faithful mirror of his well-
liked personality.
Romances of the schoolgirl-who-
marries-a-rotter type are rare these sophis-
ticated days. Ruby Pemberton Lemont.
whose Makala Farm has been published
by P. R. Stephensen at 7s. 6d., seems to
have realised that a modern miss would
hardly be credible in the old tradition,
so it all takes place before the Boer War.
When the story opens the young lady is
17 and innocent; some six months later
she’s in South Africa, a widow with three
suitors, and at the finish she’s back in
London and married again. Local color
takes the form of oxen, Kaffirs and Boers
in that order.
Peter Mostyn’s parents die at the be-
ginning of Edith Arundel’s Pilgrim on
Wings (Cassell and Co. ; Dymock’s;
7s. 6d.). He is adopted by their friend
Gluck, a flautist, and spends his child-
hood travelling about Europe with an
orchestra. Returning to England he falls
in love with Lisa, daughter of an uncon-
ventional sea captain, but she disappears,
and, after a couple of years as secretary
to Gluck, who has opened a roadhouse,
he drifts into an unsuitable marriage.
Then, of course, Lisa comes back. Peter
is well drawn —the type of idle dreamer,
forced by circumstances to be practical;
seeking always for something beyond his
grasp, but making no serious effort to
reach it. He has better luck than most
dreamers.
The Moving Finger, by Alice Meagher
(Macquarie Head Press ; 65.), covers the
period 1850-191(>. The early part of this
story of four generations leads up to the
accidental killing by Barbara Adare of
Stephen Wilson, an undesirable from the
U.S.A. who was a claimant to the
Adares’ Australian property. She is sen-
tenced to 15 years. While in Pentridge
she persuades her husband to take their
son to England. She never means to
see them again. But the war comes, she
goes to France as a nurse, and her son
is brought into her hospital wounded.
So all ends happily. It’s remarkably well
told.
The Rector of Fitton, in Norfolk, is
a self-righteous prig, and his wife, Wil-
helmina Swallow, is a colorless creature
who accepts his petty tyrannies without
protest. She is even silent when he
squanders her patrimony in foolish invest-
ments. His rule bears down crushingly
upon the lives of his family, so that when
an accident removes him from the scene
their common feeling is one of relief and
freedom. Elizabeth Montgomery has
drawn the characters in Swallows (Heine -
mann; 7s. 6d.) with a sure hand. The
atmosphere isn’t cheerful, but if you want
to know what life in a country vicarage
would be like under such a man as
Edward Swallow you can’t do better than
get this novel.

CASE FOR THE DIGGER.
It is natural for the public-service organ-
isations, now that an election campaign
is beginning, to emit louder cries of
anguish and to ask for more than they
expect to get. But when they assert
that depression measures have hit them
harder than any other section, they go
too far. They are a great deal better off
then the unemployed, the wheatgrowers,
the applegrowers and small property-
owners, whose pittances have been taxed
as if it were a crime to own property.
And nearly every war pensioner has had
to accept greater sacrifices, although the
war pensioners have not advertised the
fact.
Commonwealth public servants are
making the loudest protests. As a matter
of fact, the salaries of those in receipt
of £250 or less have, since the last Budget,
been restored to what they were in 1930,
except for cost-of-living reductions which
would have operated in any case. And
the reduction due on July 1 has been
suspended. Commonwealth public ser-
vants on £250 p.a. are getting more than
the vast majority of war pensioners
receive.
The highest war pensions paid to indi-
viduals are called “special-rate pensions”
and are fixed at £8 a fortnight. They are
paid to blind soldiers, of whom, at the
latest computation, there were 134; to
tubercular soldiers (935) and to totally
and permanently incapacitated soldiers
(1523). There are a few special cases
(spinal and double-amputation) in which
something is allowed for the services of
an attendant; under the Financial Emer-
gency Act some of these allowances were
reduced. There are also 376 consump-
tive soldiers who are held to be “capable
of engaging in employment of a light
nature” (God alone knows where they
can get it); to these Diggers £5 a fort-
night has been paid. And (as Repat.’s
report for 1933 puts it) there are “1274
tubercular soldiers receiving lesser
amounts.”
The pensions of such of these Diggers
as are family men are increased by
allowances to dependants. Allowances
to all dependants (30,298 were fatherless)
averaged 15s. 1.34 d. a fortnight in 1931,
but fell to 12s. 5.99 d. in 1933 as a con-
sequence of the financial-emergency cut,
which in most cases was 22\ p.c., and
was extended to wives. Perhaps three-
fourths of the dependants are boys and
girls, but in the main they are big boys
and girls now, and trying to keep them on
a trifle less than 6s. 3d. a week must be a
struggle. The average payment to all
classes of war pensioners in 1933 was
19s. 6.71 d. a fortnight. Total expendi-
ture that year was £6,860,500, as against
£7,774,800 in 1931.
During the boom years war pensions
remained stationary. Wages and salaries
of Government employees, Common-
wealth and State, were periodically in-
creased by Courts and single arbitrators
in the free-handed fashion of irrespon-
sible dealing with other people’s money.
They rose again with every quarterly
advance in the cost of living.
There is never, any lack of speakers or
writers to put the case for the public
servants, and some of them are very
clever. Organisations of old-age pen-
sioners have sprung up everywhere since
old-age and invalid pensions were re-
duced p.c. The war pensioners have
none. They do not go in for propaganda.
No doubt many belong to the
R.5.5.1.L.A., and others to the Limbless
Soldiers; but such associations seldom
parade the grievances of their members,
though not neglecting them. Neither do
they encourage politicians to take them
up. But now and again cases in which
individual ex-servicemen have had a raw
deal are ventilated in Parliament by some
indignant Digger member. J. C. Ross,
M.L.A. for Kogarah, drew attention to
one in the N.S.W. Parliament recently.
He began by quoting the Returned Sol-
diers and Sailors’ Employment Act,
which makes it mandatory on employers
to give “preference in any profession,
business or. industry to a returned soldier
or sailor who is capable of effectively
performing the duties of such employ-
ment,” and a relevant section of the
Local Government Act:
When making any appointment of a
servant the council shall, other things
being equal, give preference to a returned
soldier or sailor.
Then he related how the Darlington
Council, wanting a laborer used to
horses, had, a week after its Anzac Day
service, rejected a 1914-18 Light Horse-
man with first-class references and long
experience of municipal work, a married
man with five children, in favor of a
recent immigrant who was not a re-
turned soldier and produced no testi-
monials. This brought ex-Attorney-
General Lamaro, who served in the
same battalion with Ross, to his feet.
The man who went to the war sacrificed
the best years of his life. He came back,
and, after a few years of artificial pros-
perity, passed into just as artificial a
period of depression. Having lost his
youth, he is now losing his middle dge.
The administration of these measures not
only mocks the returned soldier and
sailor but makes their economical position
infinitely worse than it ought to be.
Strong language, but there can be no
question that returned-soldier preference
has been violated in all the States which
have adopted it on paper and in the
Commonwealth itself. Nearly every time
a Commonwealth vacancy is advertised
it is stipulated that applicants must be
no more than 40. That rules out every
Digger who enlisted at 25 or over.
Mr. Lamaro made another reference to
his old companions:
It is still customary for aldermen to
refer on Anzac Day to “The Deathless
Army.” Historically they are deathless,
but physically they are a rapidly dying
army. The number of those who have
passed away and the average life-span of
returned soldiers would startle hon. mem-
bers were I to state them.
If the records exist they should be pub-
lished, though it is questionable whether
Mr. Lamaro or anyone else can furnish
full and precise information. What is cer-
tain is that the Diggers have not shared
in that increase in expectation-of-life
which Australian statisticians and insur-
ance societies note with such satisfaction
from time to time. Non-combatants live
longer, men and women alike ; but not
the veterans of the A.I.F. or the R.A.N.
Lloyd George once had to remind
Woodrow Wilson that the Australians
had lost more men in battle than the
A.E.F. had lost from all causes. They
and the Maorilanders not only suffered
greater casualties in proportion to men
serving than any other group of Foch’s
armies, but from first to last they were
under a greater strain. The poilu and
the Tommy had at least the promise of
leave to be spent with the family, and it
was fulfilled again and again in the case
of those who answered the roll-call at the
Armistice ; but there was no such thing
for the Diggers. Very late —too late—in
the last campaign “Anzac leave” was
granted at the instance of W. M. Hughes
—a kindly act, criticised at the time but
justified by the event. Those who met
the Anzacs on their return were shocked
at the change in their appearance ; many
remembered as strapping, light-hearted
lads, looked and talked and bore them-
selves like worn-out old men. Idiots used
to say that the Light Horse were “having
a picnic”—a “picnic,” three or four
years of it, in the desert! A large pro-
portion came back, yellow-skinned and
wasted, with malaria.
These experiences are taking a tragic
toll in middle life of men to whom, in
happier circumstances, length of days
might have been granted. Monash has
gone, and “Pompey” Elliott and Peck of
the 11th Battalion, and Jacka the V.C.,
and Hughie Connell, and Heritage, and
many another whose name was honored
in the A.1.F.. Almost every day one
reads in the papers that some war veteran
has died suddenly of some mysterious
malady, vaguely classified as “heart
trouble.” And in the sorrowful history
of the unemployed who have gone under
in the struggle there is one entry which,
with slight variations, has been repeated
many times:
Police are endeavoring to trace the
relatives of a man whose dead body was
found in the bush. Papers in his pockets
indicate that he was a returned soldier
named Edward J. Jones. His clothes were
threadbare, and he had no money.
Turning to the annual report of the
Repatriation Department one finds these
items:

The welfare of the Diggers is the con-
cern of ihe Commonwealth Government.
That Government is now at work on
its election Budget. Demands for more
than it can possibly distribute have
poured in from every section affected by
the Premiers’ Plan except the one that
has suffered most, and suffered in silence.
Though other sections threaten till they
are black in the face, the claims of war-
pensioners, the needs of unpensioned
Diggers in distress and the rights of fight-
ing men in the services who have been
sacrificed to the clerks should be con-
sidered first.
CIVILIANISM IN THE R.A.N.
A fighting navy consists primarily of a
seagoing force of ships, aeroplanes and
trained personnel. The personnel is by
far the most important. Ships and ’planes
can be bought or improvised. Trained
men can't.
As a result of 25 years of effort we
have in Australia a superb seagoing
personnel, and we have the resources of
the British Admiralty to draw upon.
Senior R.A.N. officers have studied
naval warfare in the most advanced
schools, and they know their work. It is
hardly necessary to say that every naval
force must be based on an efficient shore
administration, complete with construc-
tional, repair and supply organisations
for the material and training establish-
ments for the personnel.
In 1922 the R.A.N. had a naval per-
sonnel numbering 4689 ranks and rat-
ings ; they were served by a shore or civil
personnel numbering 214. Since then
ships—including the seaplane carrier—
have been put out of commission on
wholesale lines, so that the once-proud
R.A.N. has become a skeleton fleet, and
ranks and ratings whom it took half a
lifetime to train have been emptied into
civil life by the hundred. The total sea-
going personnel for 1933-34 numbers
3250, a decrease in 11 years of 1439.
Over the same period the shore per-
sonnel (including civilian permanent ser-
vice, naval establishment, civil staff
R.A.N.C., and central administration)
has risen to 377!
The situation is eloquent of post-war
developments in the Defence Depart-
ment ; conditions which must be ended
before the R.A.N. can again become the
formidable arm it was. The depleted
navy is carrying on its back a superstruc-
ture of political and civil-service bureau-
crats most of whom have never studied
war or been near a battlefront. Some
have had very little experience even of
the office work of Defence. The Secretary
for Defence, the highest-salaried official
in the department, is comparatively
new to it. He was, first, Prime Minis-
ter’s secretary, then secretary to the
Prime Minister’s Department; then he
went to Australia House.
The attitude of many R.A.N. civilians
towards the fighting side of the service is
that it is a necessary evil which has to
be tolerated as a justification for the
existence of the ever-growing shore
organisation. Every R.N. senior officer
who comes to Australia on duty discovers
this within a few weeks of his arrival, in
the unlikely event of his not having
heard it in his service club before leaving
London. He is offered two alternatives.
He can surrender to the bureaucrats and,
while doing his best for the service in
the circumstances, make social functions
and golf his chief occupations ; or he can
fight. Several admirals have tried to
fight. But the imported admiral has only
a two-year tenure, and he is handicappea
further by his loyalty to service traditions
of discipline and obedience. One after
another admirals have lapsed into silence
and golf, leaving the bureaucrats to widen
their sphere of influence and attend to
the subjugation of the seagoing service.
As for the politicians, it is notorious
that in the whole history of Federation
not one Minister has so much as tried to
take charge of the Defence Department.
It is our political custom to make De-
fence Ministers of men with no military
or naval experience, and it is the custom
of permanent secretaries and their en-
tourages to see that the Minister never
gets any real insight into the workings of
the department. An outcome of this
system was seen in the singularly inept
replies made by Senator Pearce to The
Bulletin’s early articles on the Alan
Casey business.
If the Government did its duty by the
taxpayers and the R.A.N. it would im-
mediately reduce the shore personnel of
the service proportionately to the sea-
going reductions of the past decade. As
our navy is gradually built up to some-
thing approaching its fighting strength
at the Armistice, so the shore personnel
should be increased to its war-time
strength of about half the present com-
plement. The new men, where possible,
should be ex-members of the fighting
service. There is no more basis in sense
than there is in justice for the claim
which is commonly made by civilians
in the R.A.N. that no sea-trained men
are capable of doing shore work. If a
man can go to the highest R.A.N. shore
position from an office in the Strand,
then men can certainly go to minor
R.A.N. shore positions from R.A.N.
ships.
MAKING CANBERRA PAY.
By way of adding to the attractions of
Canberra it is suggested that the Gov-
ernment should issue licenses to the
local starting-price joints. A good idea,
but I have a better one. My proposal
is that all the people outside Canberra
should be prohibited from betting except
inside Canberra.
Many enlightened Governments have
seen the merits of such a sane recogni-
tion of an ineradicable instinct. When
I was a youth in Singapore with more
money in my pocket than was good for
me, I felt the urge to lose it. The Straits
Government prohibited gambling on the
island, but we only had to cross to the
territories of the Sultan of Johore to
gamble to our hearts’ content. This
strengthened the revenues of the rail-
ways, the ferries and the wine merchants
of Johore Bahru, and enabled the Sultan
to wear diamonds in his teeth.
When I was in Hong Kong I found
the British Government with the. same
good conscience. A pleasant and health-
ful trip by water to the Portuguese colony
of Macao gave us the required outlet for
our Viking spirit. In Shanghai one had
only to make a ’phone call to find a
limousine and a uniformed chauffeur
at one’s door waiting to transport one
to the roulette tables over the borders of
the International Settlement. Europe has
similar facilities in the principality of
Monaco, for whose neutrality the world
would fight as fiercely as it did for that
of little Belgium.
The two classic examples of a Govern-
ment giving itself a good conscience
while gratifying the instinctive desires of
its people are Reno and the late-lamented
Prohibition laws. Reno’s divorce mill,
of whose benefits Australians have
availed themselves, was a recognition
that the matrimonial laws were not keep-
ing pace with changes in morality and
ethics. If there was any real belief that
Reno was a blot on American civilisa-
tion, a Federal divorce law could put it
out of existence. But the Government
knows that to alter the laws would
involve almost insuperable difficulties
and much indignation, so it allows
couples to change their wedded state at
Reno as easily as they change their
butchers in their home towns.
The 18 th Amendment was passed
amidst general rejoicings because the
American people wanted to feel they could
have their liquor and have a Govern-
ment which would not tolerate the liquor
traffic in any circumstances. Thus were
moral and physical thirsts satisfied simul-
taneously.
It is within the power of the Adminis-
tration which Mr. Perkins adorns to set
an equally noble moral example and at
the same time satisfy a great human
need. The trouble is that my proposed
free betting area is also the seat of gov-
ernment. I suggest that the politicians
and public servants in the F.C.T. forth-
with remove to Sydney or Melbourne,
where everybody would be far happier,
and lease the territory to a syndicate, or
declare it a foreign country on the
analogy of Monaco. Prince Henry
might be offered the throne, thus making
the success of the venture a foregone
conclusion. Or it might be arranged to
set up an A.W.U. republic, with Arthur
Blakeley as President. Citizens of the
republic would live tax-free, and the
Commonwealth could take 50 p.c. of the
revenue.
It is idle to protest that any moral prin-
ciple is endangered that has not already
been violated a thousand times. The
Tasmanian sweeps and the various State
lotteries are well known to the
Commonwealth tax-collectors, although
Ministers have the strongest views about
their morality. My suggestion would
dispose of the necessity for such hypo-
crisy. The politicians might be safely
left to devise a reason for the change
other than the right one.
CAUBOY.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Function of a Free Press.
The people of Australia are to enjoy on
September 15 what used to be called
their “day of power.” No one employs
this phrase, except ironically, nowadays.
Under the once-reprobated Caucus
system, which all the parties have taken
over from Labor, the people are denied
freedom of choice as regards candidates.
The political heads decide who shall creep
into or be kept out of public life. In the
background, directing and controlling the
political bosses, sit departmental bosses,
anonymous and irresponsible to the ex-
tent that 90 per cent, of the electors
don’t so much as know their names,
while no power but time can shift them
from their jobs.
Under the Caucus system, however
hard up the country may be, however
drastically naval and military personnel
may be cut down, however those with
money have to be harried by the tax-
gatherers in the interests of those with
votes, there are always funds available
for politicians’ luxury tours. Tours to
England, to Egypt, to New Guinea, to the
interior of Australia. Every party sees
that its supporters get these perquisites
from time to time at the taxpayers’
expense.
In practice we have only one institu-
tion left which differentiates this country
from a dictatorship—a free press. What
the lack of a free press may lead to has
been luridly shown in Germany.
Your Caucus politician lives from day
to day. He prepares for nothing except
the next election. He has to be hounded
into almost every necessary action that
threatens to lose his party a block vote
or alienate the support of the particular
batch of permanent civil servants whose
advice on departmental problems en-
ables him to save face in Parliament. It
follows that a country has little hope of
safety in the long run without newspapers
which are prepared to talk sense and
truth irrespective of political and depart-
mental overlords. And the duty has to be
performed in peace-time; the moment a
war starts an open dictatorship is pro-
claimed by the Government of the day,
and no one gets a chance to tell the truth
for the duration.
♦
This Is Too Much!
Perhaps the Senate had to become a
party House, though it was intended to
be something better ; and once it became
a party House pre-selection in some
form or other was inevitable. But since
the machines took charge candidates
have declined in quality as well as
number.
Unless the choice of the machines is
challenged in N. S. Wales, the electors of
the State with two-fifths of the popula-
tion will pick the three Senators to be
elected in September from the weakest
field that has ever started.
Federal Labor is to be represented by
the undistinguished Senator (and “sent-
for”) Dooley and two unknowns. Lang
Labor is running its two elected Sena-
tors and a gentleman who was a stopgap
for a few months. One could rush out
into the street blindfold almost any-
where in N. S. Wales and grab two
persons as intelligent as “Bluey”
Mooney and James Patrick Dunn.
Arthur Rae was something more than
a voice once, but he is rising 75, which
means that he will be 81 if he goes back
and lasts out another term. The nomina-
tion of this ancient is presumably Mr.
Lang’s way of encouraging youth.
Mr. A. K. Dein got in three years ago
as U.A.P. member for Lang, an elec-
torate represented for many years in
the same interest, though under dif-
ferent labels, by Elliot Johnson. When
the N.S.W. redistribution commissioners
finished their job, Mr. Dein took a
glance at the new Lang boundaries, gave
a piercing cry, and said he would stand
for the Senate. And sure enough he is
to stand for the Senate, having been
“selected” by 165 members of the
U.A.P. “electoral college,” as it is called
(at the last N.S.W. Senate election there
were 1,361,691 voters). One would have
thought that even the U.A.P. would have
no use for a member who refuses to take
a chance in his own constituency.
Mr. Dein’s U.A.P. team-mate is to be
Mr. L. T. Courtenay. Mr. Courtenay is a
member of the Leg. Council, where he
has been helping his former Labor
friends to mangle Mr. Spooner’s Sydney
Corporation Amendment Bill. Mr.
Spooner fears that he will remain a
member long enough to help them to
dish the abolition of the dosshouse vote.
It is to be an A.C.D. ticket, Mr.
Macartney Abbott having been chosen by
the C.P. bosses. He at least bears a name
which has earned some distinction in N.
S. Wales politics. In spite of the bad feel-
ing that was supposed to prevail between
the parties the Macartney Abbott
nomination was hailed with joyous
whoops by U.A.P. worthies. Mr.
Courtenay naively explains that it is
because “Abbott, Courtenay and Dein
will be placed at the head of the ballot
paper.”
Past estimates have proved that position
to be worth at least 30,000 votes. A
good many people vote the first six on
the ballot paper consecutively, starting
from the first name on the list.
In other words, ignorance, levity and
contempt on the part of the electors may
put this ex-Labor U.A.P. gentleman in.
At the first election for the Senate
there were 50 candidates in N. S. Wales.
Among the defeated 44 were Donald
Macdonell, Frank Cotton, Harry Hol-
land, H. B. Lassetter, W. P. Manning,
John Kidd and G. W. Waddell, to say
nothing of John Norton and R. D.
Meagher. Under pre-selection the party
hack has gained, but the people have lost.

The British Beef Subsidy.
The Major Elliot plan provides for a
levy on Argentine beef and a lesser
levy on imports from the Dominions.
The funds so obtained will be used to
subsidise certain classes of slaughter
cattle marketed in England, at a rate
equal to Id. per pound dead weight. But,
if Argentina and the Dominions stand to
the letter of the agreements with Britain,
there can be no levy till 1936. Meantime
British cattle-raisers are to be subsidised
out of consolidated revenue.
The U.K. has only 8,000,000 cattle,
dairy herds included. Its annual beef
imports are equal to 25 p.c. of that figure
per annum. Its beef-raising capacity is
near its limit. Expansion would mean
extensive growth of fodder imports.
Britain’s main avenue of production-
growth lies in stock-improvement and
advances in early-maturity methods. To
this fact the British Government has
been alive for some time, as its Scottish
Bull Registration Act passed a couple of
years ago shows.
While quotas rule, the new scheme
will work out to the advantage of the
Dominions. The differentiation in levy
proposed is 50 p.c. against foreign
imports.
Australians need not sit back and stop
producing chilled beef. Their plan
should be to beat their competitors on
quality. When Capricornia beef joins
the food aristocracy alongside Canter-
bury lamb, there will be no dearth of
market for it. It is difficult to maintain
quotas against high-class products.
«
The Sweater Back.
Mainly to prevent sweating, the Vic.
Argyles have introduced “an amending
Factories and Shops Bill of a compre-
hensive character.” The Americans in
Hoover’s time boasted that they had
abolished poverty. Australians were
under the impression that they had
abolished sweating. The depression has
proved .that both were barking up the
wrong tree.
According to hon. Minister Kent
Hughes, sweating is practised chiefly in
the baking and clothing trades. Beauty
parlors are under suspicion, and so are
small back-room and backyard factories
doing contract work. It has cost Aus-
tralia a mint of money to set up wages
boards and Arbitration Courts for the
prevention of this kind of thing, and,
since the war, an amount at least equal
to the public debt of Tasmania has been
poured into trade-unions. Apparently
industrial arbitration is not effective out-
side a few sheltered trades, nor is trade-
unionism all that it is cracked up to be.
*
Over-Representation.
For years votes in Big-City electorates,
such as East Sydney, West Sydney and
Cook, Melbourne, Yarra and Melbourne
Ports, have had a great deal more
value than votes in certain outer-
suburban and country electorates. For
this there was no excuse, since the law
provides for equality, save that there
may be a margin of one-fifth more than
the quota or one-fifth less. The posi-
tion is to be rectified as regards one of
the Huge Wens, but in the other case
it will be worse than ever in the next
Parliament.
The latest figures give Melbourne
39,850 electors, Yarra 42,695 and Melb.
Ports 45,846; and when the rolls are
made up it is doubtful whether any of
them will be reached. Bt that as it may,
128,391 electors in these Labor divisions
will have three members while 153,407
in Henty (82,577) and Kooyong (70,830),
suburban and U.A.P., will have two.
By not having the courage to stand or
fall by the new electoral map drawn up
by the independent commissioners to
whom it referred the matter, the Gov-
ernment has thrown away a safe new
U.A.P. seat. It has also risked the loss
of “extra-metropolitan” Flinders, which
contains just on 73,000 electors, among
them the distracted coalminers of Won-
thaggi. And, apart from the considera-
tion that the rights of the people should
be respected and the electoral law main-
tained, Governments cannot afford to
take such risks.

Sheer Waste.
There ought to have been brains enough
among the 13 Commonwealth Ministers,
some of whom have very little to do,
to answer the Perth case for secession
without calling in outsiders. It could
have been done in a few hours ; indeed,
a simple statement of a few facts would
suffice.
(1) The indissolubility of the Common-
wealth as expressed in the Constitution
Act which Westralians accepted by 44,000
votes to 19,691.
(2) On a population basis, Westralia has
always had more than its share of repre-
sentation in both Commonwealth Houses.
(3) It is receiving in grants from Com-
monwealth tax-revenue more than it raises
by direct State taxes.
But Government set up an expensive
committee to do this simple job. Robert
Garran was guaranteed 150 guineas ; ex-
Senator Keating, 100 guineas and ex-
penses ; D. J. Gilbert, of Perth, the
same; W. Somerville, of Perth, the
equivalent of his salary as Westralian
arbitrator, and expenses. Expenses in
all three cases amounted to 255. a day
and fares —from Perth to Melbourne and
back in the case of the Westralian pair.
Thus the cost of government mounts
and a bit more plausibility is added to
the pretext that seven income taxes and
seven taxation departments are neces-
sary.

American Influences Waning.
Not so much American slang is heard
or read in Australia nowadays. Our
young writers have ceased to imitate
Mencken and Nathan, and have lost
something of their reverence for Sin-
clair Lewis and Dreiser. Even the vogue
of nigger music and nigger dances is on
the decline, and the supremacy of Holly-
wood pictures is no longer unchallenged.
In fact, the output of Hollywood is
criticised as never before. Young Aus-
tralians who blindly swallowed the press-
agent’s ballyhoo now go about saying
that, except for Marie Dressier, the
Barrymores, Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor
and two or three others, the only
good acting seen on Hollywood screens
is done by foreigners, and that finer-look-
ing young men and women than the spoilt
darlings of the stoodios can be seen on
any representative Australian surfing
beach. And with the breaking of the spell
cast by Hollywood that pathetic Aus-
tralian imitation of the American busi-
nessman, the “gee”-erupting, cigar-chew-
ing “executive” (as he called himself) in
horn-rimmed spectacles, has almost dis-
appeared.
A reaction against the Americanisa-
tion of Australia was bound to come.
Doubtless it has been hastened and
strengthened by resentment at the Ameri-
cans’ attitude to the war debts and by
a comparison of their boom and slump
with ours. Madly as our politicians bor-
rowed our financial and industrial leaders
were not caught unprepared when bad
times came, whereas many of their Ameri-
can congeners just careered along to
catastrophe. A hostile critic of President
Roosevelt’s measures allows that the
Finance Reconstruction Corporation
“saved the banks and insurance com-
panies.” Our banks and insurance com-
panies saved themselves. When the
banks were threatened by Mr. Scullin’s
Labor party and the insurance com-
panies by Mr. Lang’s, the Australian
people protected them.
We have helped our farmers (although
the men of our greatest land industry
have asked for no help and received
none); but we see no point in paying
them to curtail production. The pro-
posal of our Scullins and Tunnecliffes
that we should copy Mr. Roosevelt and
borrow prodigiously for public works “to
relieve the unemployed” (of course, he
really copied them) is approved of only
by those of the unemployed who had
public-works jobs before the slump. The
rest realise that when the borrowed
money was spent the country would be
worse off than before, and that they
would have lesser opportunities of get-
ting steady work in their proper callings.
And though our recovery programme has
shown little imagination on the part of
our rulers, it has not been attended by
fierce strikes such as are raging on the
other side of the Pacific.
If Communists and Sydney Trades and
Labor Councillors had their way, Aus-
tralian workers would be dragged imo
these strikes. The Sydney wharfies were
ordered by the Trades and Labor Coun-
cil not to work Matson steamers. They
have no love for the Matson line, but
they have made it abundantly plain that
they are not going to be sacrificed in a
quarrel which is no concern of theirs.
In other days the I.W.W. was imported
from the U.S.A. and a great fuss was
made of its “martyrs” ; but those days
are gone.
♦
Misguided Reticence.
Bishop Kirkby gave an address in Ben-
digo in which the “S. M. Herald” was
represented as “shot through and through
with Christian idealism.” Other papers
reported
some sensational divorce in the United
States, some rotten transaction in one of
the provincial cities of England, or some
dirty thing that had happened in Paris.
Not so the “S. M. Herald.”
But the “S. M. Herald” does report
such happenings.
The New Morality has had the effect
of dividing the Australian press into
three main groups. One group offers
what it calls the low-down on the scan-
dals and sensations of the age, and gloats
over them at length, inventing luscious
details where it seems safe to do so ;
another group comments on the occur-
rences in an objective spirit; an-
other refrains from comment. The “S.
M. Herald” belongs to the third group.
As a result of the recoil from shame
which has developed overseas, the Com-
monwealth is being bombarded with
pornographic books and films. Whether
or not they do any moral or other damage
is a matter for argument; a matter for
absolute certainty is that they scandalise
“S. M. Herald” readers, who are too
early-Victorian for even bald reports of
“sensational divorces,” “rotten trans-
actions in England,” and so on. Yet the
“S. M. Herald” rarely issues warnings
about them. It is too genteel.
This is a calamity, not only from the
standpoint of Puritans, who are deceived
by the “S. M. Herald’s” old-ladylike
reluctance to indicate obscenities, but
also from the standpoint of those who
want to see our entertainment and read-
ing standards raised. Modern novels
and talkies are almost always bad artisti-
cally in proportion as they are self-con-
sciously dirty.
+
Chain Stores.
“Tock-Tock” champions them again:
“Brass Tacks” (B. 11/7/’34) doesn’t know
the British Co-ops. They carry a minimum
stock and frequently give orders to members
of the society in their own factories or ware-
houses. Most of their 1200 branches are in
small towns and villages.
My triple defence is unshaken. To get
properly discouraged, let “Brass Tacks take
a new line (not a new fashion) into York-
street, Sydney, or “the Lane”; he will be glad
to let the chains finance his tools and dies to
recuperate him from his “misspent enter-
prise.” I definitely claim that the chains have
done more than any other class of retailer to
increase employment in factories and to drag
Australia out of the depression. They have
helped to pick up the “time lag,” and to
increase the velocity of turnover.
As far as the 2500 hands are concerned
(the number includes week-end casual girls
who are glad to earn Is. 6d. an hour), ex-
perience teaches that no chain-store girls “are
due for the sack.” Like all nice girls, they
get married after they have collected their
good-service bonus! If “Brass Tacks had
five minutes with a chain-store sales manual
he would see they compare favorably with
those issued by department stores (if any).
Will the manufacturer who doesn’t cut his
price to the bone please stand up? As to
repeat orders, the manufacturer’s chief worry is
to supply sufficient quantities when the line is
successful. He knows the chains are pushing
his goods to turn over the spot cash paid him.
Will “Brass Tacks” say why I should pay a
higher price for shaving.soap to permit a club-
footed man to be outfitted in the same store?
Remedy? There isn’t one. What is a chain?
Must we pay more for our mug of suds be-
cause we patronise a tied house? Will over-
drafts increase when banking chains are taxed.
“Brass Tacks” himself admits that his present
successful retailing was preceded by 15 years’
experience as manager of a branch neces-
sarily one of a chain.

"AND ITS PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Laelitia': The verb .to finalise (B.
23/ 5/ ’34), whether or not an Australian
coinage, was used with a deal of ex-
pressiveness by an Island official of
Scotch extraction. He was making a
report concerning a native who, through
missionary influence, had consented to
visit the nearest civilisation to have his
marriage blessed by the clergy. The item
ran: “Jimmy Charcoal is being for-
warded to town to have his wife and
children finalised.”

“Pelorus”: When “T.Y.1.” states that
Sydney has only four buildings over a
century old (B. 27/6/’34) he overlooks
that above the porch of the main build-
ing at the Fort-street Girls’ School is
The cheek of you walking in on me when I’m half dressed!”
Sorry, darling; couldn’t get here sooner.”
the date 1815. This takes us back to the
days of heavy military tread and red
coats. The Bridge has pushed away the
historic gates and the boot-worn stone-
paved drive that led to the old barracks.
It is a pity that these monuments of the
past have been ruthlessly demolished.
“Nikko”: I can throw a small gleam
of light on the mystery of the perennial
barmaid (B. 11/7/’34). M.L. had the
same experience as Victoria. Govern-
ment sleuths discovered that a brisk
trade had been going on in the sale of
the rights and names of barmaids retir-
ing from the profession ; a buyer would
drop her own name and get a job in a
part of the Dominion where her pre-
decessor was unknown, so that detection
was very unlikely. The Government was
ready to allow that old barmaids never
died, but it objected to them never even
fading away.
“Vineux”: That list of bever-
ages supposed to have been
served at an Elizabethan ban-
quet (B. 11/7/’34) is paralleled
by one offered to the guests of
one of the new-rich at the Met-
ropole, Brighton (Eng.), when
Imperial Tokay, an original
green Chartreuse and vodka
topped off the spread. Imperial
Tokay is to all intents and pur-
poses a liqueur, and its imposi-
tion on a Chartreuse seems un-
pleasantly superfluous. To serve
vodka after wines and liqueurs
is a shocking betise. Even the
Russians, who invented the
beastly stuff, never thought of
drinking it save as an appetiser
with the tremendous list of hors
d’oeuvres which always preceded
a formal meal before the Soviet days.
* Jfc :J:
“Hamer”: The biggest “laugh victory”
scored by George Reid (B. 4/7/’34) was
with a hostile crowd at the Paddington
(Sydney) Town Hall. Reid’s opponents
had started a story that he had been
afraid to appear at a meeting he was
advertised to address at Bathurst, and
when it was announced that he would
speak at Paddington they prepared to
make things lively for him. “You
funked Bathurst!” they yelled as the
orator was getting into his stride. Reid
waved an appeal for quietness. “I’ll
explain that,” he said. “I was on my
way to Bathurst in a special train, and
was having a sleep in my bunk, when
the train stopped suddenly. All the lights
went out. I began to feel about in the
darkness for my trousers” (laughter), “but
when at last I found a pair and went to
put them on I found they were not men’s
trousers” (louder laughter). Reid, lean-
ing his stomach against the table and
looking with assumed astonishment
through his carefully adjusted eyeglass on
the scene of merriment, again appealed
to be heard. “They were boys’
trousers!” he added. (Uncontrollable
mirth, lasting for several minutes.) After
that his audience appeared to forget
about Bathurst, and George got a great
hearing.

“Colerne”: “A.W.U.’s” British Colum-
bian lady may be “the real thing,” but
when he suggests that heredity helps
her I feel sceptical. When I was
“That, listeners, was Don Carlos and Senonta Carmen in the twenty-seventh
episode of ‘Purple Passion.’ ”
a boy the most-proficient and best-
paid water-diviner in the West of
England was a man named Mullins, a
stocky individual who looked more like
a cattle-dealer than a wizard. I have seen
him operate half a dozen times with
success; and he simply went to the
nearest hedge and selected a forked twig.
Mullins told me he hadn’t the
slightest idea whence he derived the
power, which he had discovered acci-
dentally. His father, he added, had no
gifts whatever in that direction ; his sons
hadn’t, either.
“Old Warden”: I am interested in
that yarn of the lady diviner who
locates mineral deposits as well as water
(B. 11/7/’34). When she comes on hidden
gold her hands “wave up and down 11
times.” When it is copper she strikes her
paws “criss-cross” five times. Why the
differentiation? The geodetic method of
survey is now soundly established, and
is being used to trace the south-westward
sweep of the Johannesburg formation
located by its means a couple of years
ago. This magnetic method indicates the
presence of mineral bodies underground
fairly accurately, but it makes no pre-
tence as yet to distinguish its find. I
wonder how the gifted lady’s hand
would perform if she walked over some
Queensland formations I have known,
where copper and gold and several other
assorted metals were combined.

“Craiser”: Paul Montford, the sculp-
tor of the Vic. Shrine of Remembrance,
has received the gold medal of the Royal
Society of British Sculptors for the best
work of the year, the Gordon statue in
Spring-street, Melbourne. Now that the
sculptors have thus endowed it with
their approval, literary societies might do
something about the selections of Gor-
don’s poetry which the committee has
seen fit to inscribe on it. That body
seems to have succeeded in picking out
the very worst examples. Here is one:
Of the works of His hand, by sea or by land,
The Horse may at least rank second.
This deplorable couplet has no justifica-
tion either in art or biology.

“Verri”: Add to those absent-minded
folk who post letters minus addresses in
pillar-boxes the people who post ’em in
fire alarms. In Maoriland, a country
supposed to be mail-minded, the clean-
up of city fire alarms invariably yields a
crop of letters. And there are other re-
ceptacles. Not long ago an Auckland
firm received dozens of complaints of
inattention to its correspondence. The
harassed manager interviewed all the
staff concerned, including the new office-
boy, who swore he had regularly de-
livered the mail to the G.P.O. posting
boxes. As a last resort they took the
youth along to the post office and asked
him to point out the box in which he
usually posted the letters. He pointed
triumphantly to a large bin outside the
G.P.0., placed there by a charitable
society needing spare magazines.
“Spare Sawbones”: “Barber-Chirur-
geon” (B. 27/6/’34) is a bit off the track
when he calls carbon dioxide the deadliest
of all asphyxiating gases. As long as
there is a sufficiency of oxygen about,
CO2 is comparatively harmless, but its
little brother carbon monoxide owes its
deadliness to its habit of ousting the
oxygen from the haemoglobin, and taking
a firm grip for itself on that important
substance. Get your patient out of the
poisoned atmosphere and artificial res-
piration will soon rid him of his surplus
€O2 ; but give him a dose of CO and
he will never be rid of it until he has
made a new supply of haemoglobin—
which takes a week or two —or has had
one given him by blood transfusion. It
is CO, not CO2, which is the deadly con-
stituent of coal gas and of motor-car
fumes. Incidentally, CO2 is never
administered in the pure state, but always
mixed with air, or with plenty of oxygen,
in the mixture known as “Carbogen.”

“R. Volt”: The Test matches have had
repercussions at Yallourn, source of
Melbourne’s electric-light supply. Be-
tween 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., consump-
tion jumps up 3000 kilowatts per hour,
owing to citizens switching on the light
to listen to the broadcasts instead of sit-
ting in the dark in their suburban
cinemas. But this is not the only Yal-
lourn index of the habits and customs of
Melbourne. Between 11 p.m. and 11.15
or thereabouts, the dynamos are called
upon for an extra 16,000 kilowatts. This
is ascribed to theatre parties coming
home and preparing a bit of supper
before bye-bye.
* * * *
“Pawang”: An usual example of the
force of auto-suggestion has come under
my notice in Melbourne. I observed that
a youth, previously suspected of being
sound in mind and body, was the shy
possessor of a set of false teeth, top
and bottom. Inquiry elicited a remark-
able story. His father had been a fre-
quent patron of the dentist, and was
loud in his denunciations of the faulty
economy of Nature. Dad would de-
clare that if he could have his time over
again he would have all his teeth re-
moved early in life, thus saving himself
pain, expense and bother. He was, fond
of describing in expressive detail the tor-
ments he had undergone. One day
the lad arrived home minus his
molars. After trying several dentists he
hqd at length found one ready to divest
him of his entire masticatory equipment.
It was on a vague assumption of the
existence of slight pyorrhoea, though I am
told traces of the complaint are present
in most mouths at all times without the
owners suffering any evil consequences.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ilie system, initiated in Melbourne, of extending
greetings and giving advice to every new telephone
subscriber through a girl operator, specially selected

so successful that it is being extended.”
Her voice, of course, is soft and low and

A thing in woman stamped as excellent

Say, what a truth, profound and elemental,
His verdict holds by general consent.
Her voice, I say again, is soft and low.

It comes, like music o'er the water stealing,
Or o’er the wire, that dulcet “Are you there?”
Intriguingly, bcwitchingly appealing,
Though this is but a business affair.
It’s just the sort of voice that sets you feeling
The scent of violets is in the air
And Beauty’s handy in the oiling, too.

The ousel’s flutelike note is in her greeting,
The vibrant freshness of the skylark’s song.
Your ’phone perplexities need no repeating;
Once heard, she’ll put you wise to what is

You haven’t Buckley’s of a closer meeting
To chuckle “Cheerio!” or sigh “So long!”

It’s evident, of the mysterious trait,

In the truncated formula s.a.
Her lure is in her personality.

T. THE R.


“Fakir”: Twenty or thirty years ago
persons in Australia professed to find dis-
sected mice and cockroaches in pies served
to them, and sued for bodily ill and
agony of mind. The game was lucrative
till it aroused police suspicions. London
supplies a case of an ingenious gentle-
man working the same lay. His specialty
was breaking a tooth on a pebble con-
tained in food served in West End
restaurants. When the insurance com-
panies had settled 27 of these claims in
12 months they investigated. They found
that the sufferers, though they all gave
different names, were respectable-appear-
ing, baldheaded old gentlemen who
always broke the same tooth and col-
lected £lO to £l5 a time under threats
of litigation. They all turned out to be
the one man, Charles Rogers, a land-
scape gardener. Charles is now doing
nine months.

“Ex-Dragoon” : “Jeames” says that the
glory that was Savile Row’s is now Han-
over-square’s (B. 11/7/’34); but I want
to put in a word for Jermyn-street. For
many years it held (and may still hold
for aught I know) the man who was con-
sidered the best tailor in London. He
built for King Edward, the Kaiser and
Kitchener. His name was Marshall. One
of my most lasting recollections is of a
visit to be measured for a tunic —during
the war. I was shown into the measur-
ing-room by one who looked like the
President of the French Republic. Then
he withdrew, and returned with the great
Marshall himself. After the conventional
preliminaries, a frock-coated servitor
appeared with a very large book, and
him Marshall gravely directed to “take
down a list of the orders and decorations
to which Mr, D is entitled.” I was
in mufti, so he wasn’t to know that my
uniformed breast was bare.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: A curious bit of evidence
cropped up in the Arbitration Court in
Melbourne in an argument over the
A.B.C.’s broadcasting band. Captain
Adkins had stated in an affidavit that “all
members in the cast of a first-class mili-
tary band are of equal importance, and
have equal responsibility.” This seems a
precise enough guide for a conciliation
commissioner charged with deciding the
rates of wages of performers, but Mr.
Coneybeer had been doing a little private
reading, and in his judgment he read an
extract from “Adkins’s Treatise on the
Military Band.” It read: “The clarionet
is pre-eminent in the military band, and
occupies the same position in that com-
bination as the violin does in the
orchestra.”
* * * *
“General Prac.”: A Sydney paper an-
nounces that a stock inspector nearly
went west the other day through absorb-
ing raw arsenic through the “pores” of his
skin. What the term raw arsenic means
I’m not sure ; but metallic arsenic—the
element —is not poisonous, though
its oxides and various other com-
pounds are. And it’s a safe asser-
tion that the damage is done by in-
halation or swallowing. All industry is
dotted with funerals amongst glass-
workers, house-painters, flower-makers,
rat-catchers and others who have died
from chronic arsenical poisoning. Even
doctors and nurses may suffer if forget-
ful that “606” is one such deadly drug,
and must be washed off the fingers before
meals. There is a tradition that the Bor-
gias and Medicis used a host of subtle
poisons- now unknown, and could put
sudden death inside a glove or a signet
ring. What is far more probable is that
they used the oxide of arsenic which has
no taste and no smell and can be mixed
with food. By such a method Wondertoa
tried to wipe out the French king
Charles VI. and four of his dukes. It
was white arsenic that killed Sir Thomas
Overbury, the Marquise de Brinvillie.s’
relatives, Madeleine Smith's lover, and
Mr. Maybrick. A word of warning to
intending murderers: since Reinsch and
“Um-m, you wouldn’t get me to pose like that, mister.”
Marsh became interested in the subject,
the detection of these poisons is an easy
job.
* * * *
“F.S.”: The melancholy fact has just
come to light that one of the most popu-
lar portraits of Batman, the founder of
Melbourne, which for 31 years has been
used as a guide for cartoonists, painters
and propagandists, is apocryphal. It is a
child of the imagination of Charles Nut-
tall. Asked by an art critic for a picture of
the pioneer in his habit as he lived, Nut-
tall scouted around for painting, bust or
photograph and, failing to find any, drew
on his powers of invention. Anyhow,
Batman died before photography was dis-
covered. The only datum with possible
claims to authenticity is Woodhouse’s
painting, based on a sketch now lost and
said to have been in the possession of
the family.
"That ought to fetch him.”
“Fetch him? It’s going to deliver him wrapped up in brown paper and tied with
a nice bow.”
“Lao-dah”: The Man They Could Not
Hang was nothing to the man nobody
could split who turned up on a false-
pretences charge at a Melbourne court
recently. In explaining to the Bench that
he had made honest endeavors to get
work he described how he had prepared
himself for a turn at the Show. Being an
ex-bruiser it occurred to him that the
toughness of his jaw was an asset that
could be sold upon the market. He tested
his idea out by laying his jaw down on
the ground in the backyard and inviting
friends to split wood on it. This experi-
ment being successful, he gave a free
demonstration at a charity bazaar. This
turned out so satisfactory that he
initiated plans for hiring a booth at the
Show and inviting all and sundry to step
up and use his countenance for a chop
ping-block. Unfortunately he was un-
able to obtain accommodation.
* * * *
“Lacte”: These so-called practical
jokes are more often malicious attempts
to injure persons from under a shield of
concealment. Two or three years ago
the effort of humor which consists of
ordering vast quantities of assorted goods
to be sent to some specified address
(Theodore Hook originated it) was re-
vived in Sydney, and numerous trades-
men suffered as well as the bewildered
victims. The other day some un-
speakable bounder poured a quart of
kerosene into 14 gallons of cow-juice
which a milkman was about to deliver
around one of the suburbs. The poor
devil had 50 or 60 customers to serve,
and, as he didn’t discover what had hap-
pened to his wares until his round was
nearly completed, it is easy to imagine
what kind of a trail of blasphemy he
must have left behind him. It seems
a pity the perpetrator of the outrage
wasn’t caught, if only to see what penalty
the law would consider a fair thing for
this sort of hooliganism.
* * * *
“Retired Killer”: The thing that im-
pressed me most about the recent
motor-car robbery in the heart of Syd-
ney was the inadequate provision made
to protect the money. A clerk took
a pot-shot at one of the robbers
from a few feet off, but without appar-
ent effect. He was armed with the
obsolete revolver, which, even in the
hands of experts, is quite unreliable at
anything over the length of a cricket
pitch. Some time ago, when the Com-
monwealth Bank was making its clerks
practise revolver-shooting. I advised the
board, through The Bulletin, to chuck
the useless contraptions away, and arm
its men with cheap Belgian shotguns
with three-quarters of the barrels sawed
off. If these are loaded with cartridges
carrying No. 2 shot, the most futile mug
in the world can hardly miss a fleeing
robber up to 40 yards. Even if the
target gets away, he will be so charac-
teristically marked as to make identifi-
cation easy.
* * * *
“Jackaburra”: Surely no word has ever
slipped so quickly and unobtrusively into
the language as “bowser.” It is not
many years since bulk handling of
petrol superseded cases and became
general in Australia. In those days there
was but one pump storage system—the
Yankee line, manufactured by one
Bowser. Before other systems came on
the market, in the absence of a more con-
venient word for a kerbside pump,
“bowser” had found general acceptance,
at least in Australia. It now ranks with
vaseline, zigzag and other trade names
that have been found to fill a want.
* * * *
“Ehoa” : “General Prac.” mentions that
Captain Cook used a decoction of barley
to keep down scurvy (B. 20/6/’34). That
wasn’t his only specific. It is on record
that he made a species of beer for his
crew at Dusky Sound (M.L.), which place
he used as a base for his great voyages
along the Antarctic ice barrier in 1772.
Cook called it spruce beer, and the main
ingredient was the foliage of the red and
black pine. His “brewery,” the remains
of which were found some 30 years ago,
was undoubtedly the first established in
these parts. By the way, the Province of
Southland, which includes Dusky Sound,
was the first place in Maoriland to feel
the force of anti-liquor legislation.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: The fate of those A.I.F.
ambulances dispatched by loving hearts
from Australia (B. 11/7/’34) recalls a
tragedy which befel one presented to
the 2nd Q.M.I. when departing for the
Boer War. There were several others,
but a shortage of regimental transport
led to this one being drafted for duty.
Moving out of Modder River it was
found that 15 jars of rum issued in bulk
by the British A.S.C. would have to go
into this light, tilted waggon or be aban-
doned. It wasn’t abandoned. The men
in charge, one an ex-corporal-major
of the Blues who was transport sarge,
and the other a permanent artillery ser-
geant with a sprained ankle, joined the
convoy moving on Paardeberg. History
tells how De Wet, in a desperate effort'
to rescue Cronje, fell on that convoy and
captured most of it. We gave our friends
up for lost until some weeks after, when
they turned up in Bloemfontein, com-
plete with ambulance, but minus the rum.
Their story was one of wild and tangled
adventure, but when it came to explaining
about the rum it became incoherent.
* * * *
“Sailor”: In his criticism of the
Frenchman’s claim to finding a sandy
bank in the Coral Sea “W.L.” (B.
27/6/’34) is a little hasty. With its heavy
tides, cross-currents and other uncer-
tainties that stretch of water can make
any skipper sit up and think. Few pearl-
ing luggers take much notice of
Admiralty charts when working in easy
stretches, and the matter of a stray bank
wouldn’t send their skippers rummaging
for the sailing directions. On a trip from
Batavia River (Cape York), with no sun
and poor visibility, it took me nine houis
to pick up Cape Wessel (Arnhem Land),
and I had worked the N.T. coastline
week in and week out for three years.
On a low-down craft a sandy islet only
a few feet above water is easily missed.
A CANBERRA GRIEVANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A deputation of Canberra citizens waited on the
Minister for the Interior to request that starting-price
bookmakers should be legalised. ‘Business’ is being
taken to Queanbeyan.”
A Garden City, so they tell, is ours,
The grandest that the Commonwealth can
show,
A real Arcadia for trees and flowers,
With bosky shrubs and gay parterres aglow.
Lucky to live here? Well, it may be so,
But still it’s mighty hard upon a man
That, when he wants a bet, he needs must go
For books that lay the odds to Queanbeyan.
Here massive statesmen spend their strenuous
hours
In high debate. We are the first to know
When the inevitable danger lowers
That means a Ministerial overthrow.
We are a Washington in embryo,
Yet our amenities in vain you scan
For just a solitary Iky Mo;
The nearest place for such is Queanbeyan.
Above all other burgs our city towers;
We rightly rate ourselves, disdaining blow,
The pulsing centre of a nation’s powers,
The hub of all these Austral skies below.
But in our cup remains one drop of woe:
On s.-p. betting joints is still a ban,
And he who on a gee would stake his dough
Must needs communicate with Queanbeyan.
Prince —Perkins, rather —of a truth we know
You’ll sympathise with us, if any can.
Stay, we implore, this easy money’s flow
From Canberra to humble Queanbeyan!

POLITICAL POINTS
N.S.W. Premier Stevens found revenue
£3,300,300 short of expenditure when he
wound up the financial year. It is an
improvement of nearly £600,000 on
1932-33 figures; and endowment tax
was waived for part of the year, while
other taxes were cut. Even so, it is
clear that the Government cannot really
afford to distribute that £400,000 among
the civil servants.
Queensland’s unemployment figures
since the end of 1929 have always sup-
ported the notion that it will be the first
State to bid the depression good-bye and
good riddance. Now its Government has
committed itself to the prediction that
the need for issuing relief rations will
have vanished within 12 months. Deputy
Premier Pease spoke in this prophetic
vein at Innisfail.
Hitherto none of the small States has
lost a seat or been under-represented in
the Federal House. Both things are to
happen to South Aus. On census figures,
population per member will be 45,521 in
Tds., 87,402 in W.A., 91,018 in Victoria,
92,897 in N.S.W., 94,427 in Queensland
and 96,831 in South Aus. Latham admits
that it is indefensible, but says that if jus-
tice were done the Constitution would
be violated and the whole of the elec-
tions might be upset.
Lang’s newspaper reports that his
seat-warmer, Gander, “convulsed” the
House of Reps, by saying that N.S.W.
had “as good a Legislative Council
as money can buy.” Evidently Lang-
sters don’t mind pinching good things
from the other Labor group, much as
they hate it. The quip was written by
Arthur Griffith for The Bulletin of
Nov. 15.
“Diver” Hughes continues to be a
thorn in the side of Westralian Labor,
in whose interest he once sat as M.L.A.
for East Perth. The State Full Court has
upheld the Supreme Court judgment in
his case against Clydesdale, the Labor
M.L.C. and Government Lotteries Com-
mission chairman, whom he charged with
holding an office of profit under the
Crown; the effect is that Clydesdale has
to pay Hughes £2OO and forfeit his seat.
The Government brought in indemni-
fying legislation, but bungled it.
When (or if) the banking scheme is
remoulded according to Scullin’s ideas,
The whole of the resources of the nation
will be behind the Commonwealth Bank.
It goes without saying that the security
granted to depositors will be greater than
that offered by the private banks.
But will it? The tale is merely an
elaboration of the one pitched to de-
positors in Lang’s Savings Bank. All
their accounts were “guaranteed by the
Government.”
A so-called National Council Against
War is trying to get the Collingwood
Town Hall for its “second annual con-
gress.” It seems a suitable place in
which to hold it. There is nearly always
a war on there, and aldermen are gener-
ally in it.
Though Crofts, one of the three Vic.
Labor candidates for the Senate, is only
a lightweight, he will be a fearful burden
for the party to carry. He is Lang’s man
at Melbourne Trades Hall, and as a
reward for favors, past and to come, Lang
put him on the Sydney Gas Commis-
sion and gave him a railway pass, which
was recalled when Stevens cancelled the
appointment. As Lang’s man standing
with two of Scullin’s Ministers, Crofts
will cause discord and excite ridicule
wherever he goes.
The hoodlum who obstructs Common-
wealth election meetings is now to be
liable to expulsion by police when the
chairman points him out, and to arrest if
he returns and starts roaring again.
Penalty £lO or a month. Something of
the sort was needed to preserve the right
of public meeting. In the past the
hoodlum has had things his own way.
On the railway over Sydney Bridge
the Government is losing £157,000 a
year. Bruxner made this admission to a
deputation of furniture-van owners who
complained that the graball department
was trying to put them out of business.
Parkhill is credited with energy, but
does not seem to have imparted it to his
department. A few days ago General
Motors-Holden’s, South Melbourne, re-
ceived a parcel of copper tubing. As
the packing slip showed it was posted
at Brisbane on March 14, 1929.
It would be a great thing for Australia
and themselves if some of our leading
politicians followed the example of Mus-
solini, who peeled his shirt and walloped
with a flail all one hot morning the first
corn grown on the drained Pontine
marshes. Stevens and Lyons could both
do with the loss of waistline a spell of
toil of the kind would ensure. Willis
and Baddeley also suggest themselves as
eligible candidates, while Parkhill’s figure
simply shrieks for treatment.
“It’s great to be reconciled, isn’t it, Joe? And wouldn’t it be grand if all old
friends who fall out made it up as we’ve done?”
“Well, I wouldn’t say all, Earle!”
Donald Cameron is to stand for Lilley
(Q.) now Speaker Mackay is retiring.
Lilley was once a farming electorate for
the most part; since revision of boun-
daries cut out the northern section and
added a bit from the south it is now
largely metropolitan, counting Greater
Brisbane as a metropolitan area. This has
given Labor high hopes of capturing the
seat, but the other side reckons that
Cameron’s personality and record will
counterbalance any increase in Labor
votes.
Sydney daily newspapers have been
flooded with advertisements issued in
the name of the Egg Marketing Board
calling upon poultry-farmers to spring to
the defence of that comic-opera concern
against “speculators.” The propaganda
was preceded by a Ministerial admission
in Parliament that “a certain company”
had offered to buy 40,000 cases of eggs
from the board at 2d. a dozen more
than its fixed price, and had been turned
down. The farmers who lost this profit-
able contract were privileged to pay for
the advertisements.
Queensland Economic Bureau attri-
butes the reduction of the State deficit
to decreased expenditure (£122,000) and
increased collections of revenue other
than from taxes (£332,000); tax receipts
fell £29,000. Pity Forgan Smith didn’t
take his courage in both hands when
drawing up his Budget. A million off
the taxes might have brought the unem-
ployment position to normal.
“Some senior Ministers” would be glad
to have the Vic. Parliamentary term ex-
tended from three years to five. Premier
Argyle has given an assurance that the
“reform” will not be carried out with-
out a mandate. It is possible that the
State would be better served if Ministries
like Argyle’s and Butler’s were put in for
five years instead of three ; but thousands
doubt it.
Tas. Labor, which asserted during the
late election campaign that the State
deficits were far greater than as re-
ported, and that the Speck would go
broke if it remained in the Common-
wealth on the present terms, has had to
announce that the debit balance for 1933-
34 was £47,800. This doesn’t look so
bad; but possibly it will now be ex-
plained that the accounts were cooked.
Queensland reports a profit of £300,000
on its Golden Brisket gamble last year,
and Tas. receipts from Tatt.’s are up
£35,000 or so. But revenue from Mr.
Weaver’s N.S.W. lotteries continues to
decline (“sales of tickets dropped half a
million in three months”), and Mr.
Weaver is in a dreadful state about it.
To stop the drift he is prepared to make
any sacrifice so long as he isn’t it.
C. W. Frost, who represented Franklin
(Tas.) at Canberra in Scullin’s time, is
coming out again. He stood for the
State electorate of Franklin last month,
and, though he just failed of election, the
figures give him a good chance. He can
depend upon the active help of Premier
Ogilvie, who headed the Franklin poll.
Vic. Federal Cocky members have
been commanded by Hocking and
Stahle, of the “central council,” to sign
a pledge that they will do all manner of
things:
Retire from the election if not endorsed;
advocate the party’s platform and policy,
if elected; abide by any alterations or
additions to the platform and policy;
undertake not to accept any joint Minis-
terial responsibility unless same is sanc-
tioned by central council; agree not to
nominate for re-election if I fail to submit
my name as a candidate for endorsement
or pre-selection.
Paterson, Gibson and the rest are re-
sisting this arrogant coterie, as Dr.
Harris did. And if they don’t weaken
they will beat it as the doctor did.
Tas. Labor is not repeating the blunder
it committed in 1922, when it let Jim
Ogden stand for the Senate alone, thus
throwing away two seats. It is nominat-
ing four men for the three vacancies,
besides five for the Denison seat. It
long ago discarded the selection ballot as
a nuisance.
A kind-hearted doctor writes to “S. M.
Herald” saying it is a shame that a widow
drawing income from property “should
pay tax at the same rate as a healthy
young bachelor” on a salary. The fact
is that the widow’s rate is higher. The
bachelor gets a Commonwealth exemp-
tion of £250. Her exemption is £2OO, and
on income in excess of £250 she pay's a
super-tax of 6 p.c. The property-income
rate is also higher in N.S.W., and if the
widow draws part of her income from
Victoria there is a special N.S.W. tax
of lOd. in the £. And in Victoria pro-
perty rates are double the rates on per-
sonal earnings.
Membership of the M.L. Leg. Council
having declined to under 20, the Gov-
ernment has made 15 appointments.
These include two of Massey’s Ministers
(knight Heaton Rhodes, reappointed, and
G. Anderson), five other Reformers,
two Liberals, one U.P., two Laborites
and two businessmen, whose political
affiliations have not been made con-
spicuous. Average age of the bunch
is 60.
Communists seem to have plenty of
money for litigation and elections. It
is announced that they are going to run
29 candidates for the Commonwealth
polls, including one for the Senate. That
will cost them £725 for a start, and they
are unlikely to get a cent back.
Characteristic exchange of compli-
ments at Canberra:
James (Lang Labor): I’ll throw an ink-
well at you if you interject any more.
Parkhill: And. I’ll throw it back.
James: Sitting there pulling faces like
a monkey!
Parkhill: You’re a gorilla.
James: I regret that I placed a monkey
in the same category.
Parkhill: The tears in his voice, the
whining way he speaks, the tone he uses!
Parkhill is the Minister who went to
a postal conference at Cairo, continued
on to two other continents and turned in
a bill for £2637. He came back declar-
ing that the jaunt had placed his Gov-
ernment in a strong position to attack
“problems which require solution” ; but
obviously it didn’t improve his political
manners.

John White has had an 80th birthday
in Adelaide. He is an unusual combina-
tion. A chemist by profession, he was
one of the founders of S.A. Pharmaceu-
tical Society. Also he has been president
of the S.A. Society of Arts, and three of
his pictures are in the Adelaide Art Gal-
lery.
Colonel Hubert Carter, dead in Bris-
bane, succeeded his father as g.m. of the
Q. Atlas Insurance Co. He was a member
of the old Moreton Regiment, and first
saw active service as a captain with the
sth Q. 1.8. in South Africa, where he was
severely wounded. He served with a
Queensland infantry battalion on Galli-
poli and on the Western Front.
Dr. J. H. Rutter, of Yarram (Vic.),
was front-page stuff for two days and a
half in the Melbourne papers while the
fishing ketch he was on was trying to
effect a landing in a gale at Cliffy Island,
20 miles from Welshpool. The object
was to rescue the lighthouse-keeper’s wife
and take her to the mainland for an
operation. The doctor has had a long
acquaintance with the forbidding island.
In 1919 he swam ashore with a medical
kit on his back to attend a scalded
keeper. He got aq R.H.S. medal for this
Brigadier O. F. PHILLIPS, a great fighting soldier and Aus-
tralia’s new Q.M.G.
feat. In 1930 he attended another patient
under similar conditions.
“M. 8.”:
Kaye Don couldn’t have chosen a worse
spot to stage a car-smash (while driving at
60 m.p.h. without lamps or a horn after
sunset) than the Isle of Man. Douglas, where
the accident which caused the death of Don’s
mechanic occurred, is a speedster’s paradise,
and the inhabitants abhor fast drivers. His
conviction for manslaughter was almost in-
evitable there ; in many parts of the Empire
(N. S. Wales, for example), a good lawyer
might have got him off. Don was discharged
from the Army Service Corps as medically
unfit at the beginning of the war. He
promptly volunteered for the R.F.C., was
accepted, and did great work as a pilot on
the Western front. No onp will be more
surprised than Don’s American wife that one
so rich and influential should have been so
speedily brought to book. They have only
been married for a couple of years.
Arthur Mills (a Brigadier-General
when on the warpath) has become presi-
dent of the United Service Institution of
N.S.W. in succession to O. F. Phillips.
Mills started soldiering with the N.S.W.
Lancers and went to the Light Horse
early in 1915. After being commandant
of the Ist A.L.H. at Heliopolis he rode
into Sinai as a major in that brigade.
Later he transferred to the Camel Corps,
commanded the 4th Anzac Battalion of
the I.C.C. and got his D.S.O. Two new
L. regiments (the 14th and 15th) were
formed from the dismounted Cameliers,
and Mills was given the 15th. He is
now in command of the first Cavalry
Division.
Born and educated at Bairnsdale (Vic.),
a printer in Q., a tailor in S.A. and
M. in that State from 1915 till his
death was the queer record of William
Morrow, who has died in Adelaide at 61.
“Lond.”: “Smiler” Hales has just pub-
lished his 45th book: a romance of the
Peninsular War which introduces both
Wellington and Napoleon. The period
is, of course, 1810 or earlier. “Smiler”
has delighted the critics by introducing
“the young and winsome Queen Vic-
toria” —of some 30 years later.
Herewith Aus-
tralia’s new
Q.M.G., O. F.
Phillips. He was
born in Queens-
land 52 years ago,
joined the State
artillery in 1900,
and transferred
later to the C.M.F.
He served on Gal-
lipoli and in
France, and as
Com mandant of
the R. A. Second
Division he won
the D.S.O. and the
much rarer Ameri-
can D.S.M. Back
in Australia he
held various staff
jobs, including that
of Commandant in
South Australia
and Director of
Ordnance. He be-
came N. S. Wales
Commandant last
year.
Brigadier Fran-
cis Heritage, who
has died after an
appendicitis opera-
tion, always ex-
pected to go out
from a heart
attack, having had
a weakness there
for years. The son
of a Tasmanian
schoolmaster, he
joined the Tas. In-
fantry Regiment
47 years ago, and
thereafter saw ser-
vice wherever Aus-
tralian troops were
engaged. He went with his regiment to
S. Africa in 1899 ; was brigade-major of
Australia’s first expeditionary force ; and
became the first military Governor of
New Guinea. He served in France with
the 4th Division. After the war he was
successively State Commandant in W.A.;
Commandant of the R.M.C., Duntroon •
State Commandant in N. S. Wales, and
Q.M.G. and third member of the Army
Board. His death should mean the imme-
diate promotion to lieut.-general of
Major-General Bruche—a step which will
n , . r
enable Bruche to serve for another three
years. Had the late Brigadier lived he
would have become chief-of-staff on
Bruche’s retirement at the end of this
year. Heritage’s best work for the Aus-
tralian Defence Forces was the founda-
tion of the Australian School of Mus-
ketry in 1911. As chief instructor and
commandant, he substituted for the
casual methods of the past the teachings
of the- Imperial army in the matter of
rapid, aimed fire with the service rifle.
W. J. Cleary,
successor to C.
Lloyd Jones as
chairman of the
Broadcasting Com-
mission, was
general manager of
Tooth’s when the
last Bavin Govern-
ment named him
Chief Railway
Commissioner. He
was relieved of
this job under the
disastrous Lang
regime. The
Stevens Govern-
ment made him
Transport C o m-
missioner, but he
resigned. Broad-
casting should suit
him even better
than beer. He is
a musician; a
reader with a wide
range of interests;
he took an econo-
•mics degree at
Sydney Uni., and
he understands the
taste of the people.
Like the present
chief of Toohey’s
he started work at
Tooth’s as an
office-boy.
Bill Beach, ex-
champion sculler of
the world, went
sick at his home in
Wollongong last
week. As he is 86
his friends were
perturbed. Then
he said he was all
right again and got
up. Six feet in
height and with the
frame of a heavyweight boxer, he has
always been a physical marvel. He was
a crack pigeon-shot and one of the best
game shots in N. S. Wales at 60. He
was over 80 when he started to drive a
car.
The chair of Botany in Adelaide Uni-
versity, vacant since Osborn moved to
Sydney in 1928, is to be filled by J. G.
Wood, then, and since, lecturer there.
(Harvey Johnston has been acting-Prof,
in addition to his Zoology duties.) Wood
is only 33. Locally educated, he had
two valuable research years at Cam-
bridge, Aberdeen, Aberystwyth, and in
Europe’s wine-growing areas. Latterly
he has specialised in “arid flora”—the
growth of saltbush and the like with little
or no rain.
“Jeames” on the Buckmasters:
The decision of Mr. John Buckmaster, son
of Gladys Cooper, to become a professional
boxer is a form of plagiarism; it will be re-
membered that the mother of the Admirable
Bashville was an actress. Young Buckmaster’s
father, H.J., was one of -the world’s best
polo players and a picturesque figure in the
West End of London in the early years of the
century. Men liked him, even if all women
didn’t. When he married the girl who was
to become England’s typical beauty just a
quarter of a century ago she was an obscurity
with a Cockney accent. But she had genius,
and he only had money and a gift for games,
£ r ' h d e Xn'The' forgotten
Buck’s Club, and it became almost immediately
a formidable rival to Arthur’s, Boodle’s and
even White’s. These ancient St. James’s-street
institutions refused to instal cocktail bars when
became fashionable. Buck’s
star ted with the most elaborate private bar in
England.

years, the last 20 being as deputy head-
which is also a record.
W. J. CLEARY embarks on his latest job—chairman of

J. A. Philp, now living in retirement
in Brisbane, must be the oldest leader-
writer in Australasia. He first pontifi-
cated on the Thames (M.L.) “Star” in
1878. Philp joined The Bulletin as a
sub-editor ten years later, and he has
been a contributor for nearly half a cen-
tury. His “A Southern Serenade,” which
appeared originally in The Bulletin,
was bracketed in “John o’ London’s”
with Brunton Stephens’s fine poem “Out
of the Orb-studded Night” in an article
on the use Australian poets have made
of the skies.
Mrs. Thomas, of Ballarat, fore-
stalled Melbourne by having her own
centenary celebrations on Monday. She
arrived in Melbourne nearly 80 years ago,
and started for the Ballarat diggings
forthwith. Her husband, whom she had
married in Wales in 1854, was already
there. She had been a school-teacher as
a girl, and went back to her old calling
when gold-digging turned out less re-
munerative than had been reported in
England. She saw the funeral of the
Duke of Wellington, and was one of
those who filed past his body as he lay
in state.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
The Company is being formed (inter alia) primarily to acquire an area of alluvial
gold bearing deposits near the Shoalhaven River, N.S.W., together with certain
plant: to exploit the known payable areas either by dredging or by such other
methods as the Directors may decide, and to test further the ‘additional areas not
yet conclusively proved.
METHOD OF OPERATION.
Acting on a concensus of expert technical opinion the Company proposes to
construct a bucket dredge, with Monitor attachment, to work the areas. . It is
anticipated that the erection of the dredge will occupy a period of approximately
six months. During that time the remaining areas will be fully tested.
SIGNIFICANT FEATURES.
The property secured, known as
"Hogden’s Area,” is situated near
Oallen, about 40 miles south-east of
Goulburn. It comprises an area of
about 250 acres of good alluvial gravels
and sands, adjoining the properties of
Haven Gold Dredging No Liability and,
on the other side, the areas on which
the Oroville Dredging Co. Ltd. (London)
has taken option. Haven Gold Dredg-
ing No Liability, after fuly testing its
areas is about to float its first dredge.
Its contributing shares are at a substan-
tial premium. Tests taken by the Oro-
ville Company show decidedly encourag-
ing results.
Results achieved by the Vendors working
two faces during 3 years by hydraulic
sluicing plant have reached a stage merit-
ing energetic exploitation under modem
methods. Much essential preparatory
work is already completed. Two faces
have been exposed. The depths exposed
are 50 ft. and 70 ft. respectively. Many
test shafts have been sunk between these
faces with positive results.
EXPERT REPORTSReports by Tom Yeomans, Esq., Mining Engineer,
late Field Engineer, Placer Development Co., New Guinea, and A. R.
Miller, Esq., L.S., Registered Mine Surveyor, of Goulburn (fully quoted
in Prospectus) show that the proved yardage available for immediate
recovery is between 7,000,000 and 8,000,000 yards, the average value
being set down at 9d. per yard.
Both experts agree that the additional area (not yet conclusively proved)
should yield a minimum of another 5,000,000 yards of deep lead of
similar value. Expert opinion estimates the cost of gold recovery at
about 2yd. per yard, with an allowance of Id. per yard for all overhead
costs, making a total of 3d. per yard. The quantities to be treated are
conservatively estimated at 30,000 yards of sands per week, or 1,500,000
yards per annum. Estimated life of the area: 5 years minimum (with a
probable further life of about 5 years).
Mr. Yeomans’ report, together with that of Mr. Miller, is printed in full
in the Prospectus of the Company.
GOLD OUTPUT.—Estimated annual returns from gold won (on basis
set out above):
Revenue: 1,500,000 yards per annum, returning 9d.
ESTIMATED PROFITS: —On the basis of the estimated nett profit of £17,500,
the return would be equivalent to approximately 30 per cent, per annum, on a
subscribed capital of £57,500 —it is proposed to call the shares to 3/- each—after
allowing for amortisation of capital over the first five years.

For easiest and speediest
tyre inflation ....
The “RENRUT” pump offers remarkable service, ease ana
efficiency in tyre inflation.
It is the pump with a quadruple compression—a double-
acting cylinder, drawing in air both with the up and
down stroke, so providing a volume usually
obtained only with a barrel twice the size.
Manipulation of this large volume is ren-
dered very easy by the inner high-
pressure cylinder.
Strongly built and handsomely
finished, the “Renrut” Quadruple
is the pump for speed and
service, to make inflation
easier than ever before.

HEAD OFFICE,
BRISBANE, JULY 12. 1934.
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
THE QUEENSLAND NATIONAL BANK, LIMITED.
The Directors now beg to submit the One-hundred and ninth Report, with the
Balance Sheet and Auditors’ Report attached.
The Net Profit for the Year ended June 30 last, after allowing for
Rebate on Bills Current, Interest Accrued on Deposits and
Interminable Inscribed Deposit Stock, all assessments of Income,
Land and other Taxes payable during that period, reducing
Bank Premises and Furniture Accounts £2500, making pro-
vision for Bad and Doubtful Debts and *all known Contin-
gencies and including Recoveries, amounts to £67,411 1 10
To which is to be added amount brought forward from year ended
June 30, 1933 £21,684 6 I 1
Making a total of £89,095 8 9
Out of which an Interim Dividend was paid at the rate of 4 p.c.
per annum for the Half-year ended December 31, 1933,
amounting to £35,000 0 0
Leaving for Distribution £54,095 8 J)
Which it is proposed to deal with as follows:
Dividend at the rate of 4 p.c. per annum for the Half-year
ended June 30, 1934 £35,000 0 0
(Free of Queensland Income Tax and without deduction
• in respect of Federal Income Tax payable by the Bank.)
Balance to be Carried Forward . £19,095 8 9
£54,095 8 9
Again I have to report very little demand for accommodation by way of overdraft
during the period under review, and we have continued to ration Fixed Deposits,
more especially those carrying no collateral advantages. Total Deposits show an
increase of £69,081, those bearing interest being £533,426 lower and those not
bearing interest £602,507 higher. We have shaded overdraft interest rates drastic-
ally and to Primary Producers, in necessitous cases, to a vanishing point as far as
profit is concerned, but this policy has put heart in our customers, kept them on the
land, and enabled the sheepfarmers to participate in the very welcome rise in
wool values. I mention here that we are in possession of only one small property.
With another good season and wool prices holding, we can look forward to increased
revenue from sheep advances. We have already announced that our maximum rate
of interest as at July I, 1934, on all advances, is 5 p.c. per annum.
During the period under review we have purchased at a discount and cancelled
£160,617 10s. .2d. of our Interminable Inscribed Deposit Stock, and this, together
with profitable dealings in Australian Consolidated Loan, has helped us along.
have not been drawn upon during the current year.
£2500 is recommended for depreciation of the Bank Premises and Furniture.
Reference to the Balance Sheet will show the extra details required by the provisions
of the Queensland Companies Act of 1931.
Since Last Balance date, the Branch at Cooktown (Q’land) has been closed.

During the year Bs. per share (£44,000)

£66,000 in 110,000 shares of 12s. each.
This followed the return of 4s. per £1
share of the co.’s holding of 100,000
fully-paids in Kandos Cement. The next
table shows more exactly what has hap-
pened:—

To make the payments the board leant
upon sundry creditors for an extra
£13,544. The net reduction in debtors’
balances and shares in other cos., etc.,
was £15,814; stocks, £3440; plant, etc.,
£5OOO. It is plain from the £69,545 at
which the blanket item appears that the
holding in Kandos figures at less than its
face value; and, since the market prices
the now-fully-paid 16s. shares in Kandos
at 19s. 6d., there is also a nice inner re-
serve in the item.
The £6202 of profit claimed last year
(the co. may have done a bit better) was
a shade over 9 p.c. on capital as it now
stands, and shareholders got 7 p.c. after
a two-year dry spell. Of the £6202,
appearances are that £5OOO came from
Kandos, and £1202 from the co.’s own
tile works, etc. (thanks to the recovery in
the building trade), which for the three
preceding years were a drag, and even
before that seem to have contributed
little.
As for the current term, immediate
prospects are that the co.’s own works
may turn in a bit more, and the market
expects that Kandos will pay another 5
p.c. div. (worth £4OOO to G. and S., or
6 p.c. on its capital) for the year to
June 30 last. What the future which is
not so immediate holds will depend
largely upon conditions in the building
trade and upon expenditure on public
works. The market therefore prices G.
and S.’s 125.-paid shares at 16s. 9d. The
return at that figure is 5 p.c. on a 7 p.c.
div. basis. The visible cover is 14s. 2d.
in net tangibles.

This Rockhampton merchandising co.,
with strong connections outback, has a
splendid history. Since the beginning of
this century, paid capital has advanced
£93,750 to its present figure
(£250,000) with the aid of only £11,250
of cash subscriptions. Also the div.,
which was steady at 10 p.c. for over 20
years to the close of accounts in ’32,
was sweetened with a p.c. bonus in
the fattest years. The rate has now
been dropped to 8 p.c. Still, with re-
serves piled £13,325 higher than paid
capital, the two combined need net only
3.8 p.c. to pay '8 p.c. on capital alone ;
and, with the whole of the capital and
£92,741 besides invested outside in
Consols (£200,000), other securities
(£41,014) and on fixed deposit, etc.
(£101,727), the business itself doesn't
need to turn in much to enable an 8 p.c.
div. to be paid.
Last year gross earnings were £1142
better, thanks to the rise in the price of
wool; but a run of good returns is
needed before traders can collect over-
due debts:

It was the saving of £2512 in exes, that
put most of the spring in net earnings,
which were £3654 better at 10.8 p.c. on
capital as against 9.3, 11.1, 6.4, 14.8 and
17 p.c. back to 1929.
The year’s growth of £11,997 in the
book value of stocks and of £1420 in
debtors’ balances is encouraging:

The growth of £52,664 in the cash item
appears to be due mainly to a transfer
from sundry investments, previously
lumped with freehold in the sheet. The
co. is exceptionally equipped to enlarge
its activities as soon as opportunity
offers, and/or adjust its capital to ensure
satisfactory divs. from reduced earnings.

The slip of £10,929 in last year’s net
earnings was due to the unsatisfactory
loss experience, which resulted in a
contraction of £11,332 in the underwrit-
ing surplus, £371 as against £11,703 for
the previous term. The trouble occurred
in the Adelaide branch, which is to be
closed. Net premiums shrank £5889, due
apparently to a reduction of 15 p.c. in
premiums on motor-cars:

Of each £lOO of net premiums, claims
ran off with £l6 10s. more than in the
preceding term, and exes, were £6 per
cent, heavier. However, the closing of
the Adelaide branch and better arrange-
ments in connection with reinsurance
are expected to make a difference.
The £25,000 of paid capital had the
support and assistance of £53,648 of
reserves, and the lot was invested mainly
in Government securities and freehold.
The return from investments alone
(£2773) was thus 11 p.c. on capital. The
div. was kept at 12 p.c., though to pay
it and hand £1726 (down £1437) in
bonuses to policy-holders reserves had
to be tapped for £1582.
At April 30 policy-holders could see
net tangibles equal to 178 p.c. of the
year’s net premiums, and that is 28 p.c.
more than is usually considered ade-
quate. There was £21,435 coming to
outsiders. Government securities and
cash totalled £58,038; freehold, etc.,
£43,034 ; debtors, £6122 ; shares in other
cos., £391.
About six years ago the co. severed
its connection with the Royal Auto. Club
(Vic.), and welded “Fire and General”
into its title. The connections have
since been strengthened by the patronage
of the United Travellers’ Association
and the “Herald” Touring Club.
The capital is in £1 shares paid
to 10s., of which 5000 carry a cumulative
8 p.c. and advance with the ords. beyond
that rate. The ords. fetch 245. 4d. as
against 19s. 6d. a year ago ; the return
at the higher figure is 4.9 p.c. on a 12 p.c.
div. basis. The cover is 335. lOd. in net
tangibles. Prefs. are not listed.

"Fourteen months.
Considering the size of the debt
(£238,225 at the close of accounts in
1930) and the moderate reserves, this co.,
which operates works at Auckland and
New Plymouth, has come through the
last few difficult years very well. That was
largely because the Government assisted
farmers to purchase top-dressing, the
aim being to improve the quality and
quantity of their output, and so take
some of the sting out of the blow from
low prices. In return the fertiliser cos.
reduced their selling prices, and turn-
over livened to the benefit of costs, which
were also assisted by an overhaul of
manufacturing and distributing methods.
During the last term there was marked
improvement in the sale of super., the
selling price was reduced by ss. per ton,
and the Government subsidy was lowered
from 10s. to 55., leaving the price to the
farmer, who got the benefit of reduced
costs before they were realised, un-
changed at £4 a ton. The co.’s gross
earnings (£74,254) sprang £BO3l, and
exes. (£56,536) took £3,594 of the in-
crease, leaving the net result £4437 better
at 6.8 p.c. on capital as against 5, 5.7,
1.7, 10.1 and 10.5 p.c. back to 1929. The
div. was kept at 5 p.c., and no harm
will be done if it remains there until the
debt is further reduced and reserves
strengthened.
The position as balance-sheet figures
show it is as follows:
1924. 1930. 1933. ' 1934.
Paid capital.. £261,745 £261,995 £261,995 £261,995

Book debts .. 35,906 38,302 22,483 45,001
Cash, etc. .. 409 70 70 7o
The brisker trading is reflected in a
growth of £22,518 in debtors’ balances
and a reduction of £63,512 in stocks. On
fixed assets £12,754 more was written off
than was spent, making the contraction
in their book value £28,516 over the last
four years, despite substantial additions
to plant meanwhile. Though £17,716 was
added to the amount coming to sundry
creditors, £76,084 was knocked off the
overdraft. When the books closed the out-
side debt exceeded more or less liquids
by £72,744, which was £17,374 less than
at the previous balance.
At 21s. 3d. the pound shares return
4.7 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis. The net
tangible cover is 235. 5d., all in plant,
etc., worth what it can earn.

The outlook for shareholders in this little
Adelaide concern seems extremely drab.
The co. was launched at the tail-end of
the boom (in 1929) as Peeks Investments,
Ltd., but changed its name to the present
title in the following year. Originally the
idea was to buy Peeks’ book debts at a
discount, and to trade generally as a
cash order and discount concern. In
1932 the co. went into and then out of the
tailoring business. Meanwhile it had put
out 14,790 8 p.c. cum. prefs., now paid
to £5815, 10,937 preferred ords., paid to
£4444, and 50,397 ords., paid to £28,921.
Thus, with £5962 of calls in advance,
paid capital became £45,142 at the end
of 1933 ; £26,124 of it was then
represented by goodwill (£10,000), flota-
tion exes. (£11,068, up £209) and a p. and
1. debit (£5056).
Here is a view of the rest of the busi-
ness so far as balance-sheet figures dis-
close it:
1931. 1932. 1933.
Paid capital .. .. £38,725 £38,918 £45,142
Sundry creditors .. 441 770 586

Debtors’ balances .. 6,914 3,092 4,832
Cash 955 98 377
Equipment, etc. . . 55 117 84
The £6224 of capital gathered during the
year was used mainly to pay £3860 on
22,150 ords. in Peeks, Ltd. —there was
another £7179 outstanding. Peeks is a
tailoring and mercery business which
plunged into debt to finance property
investments, planned on the basis of con-
ditions as they were a few years ago. It
passed into the hands of a receiver about
the middle of last year, and what its
shares will turn out to be worth,
if anything, remains to be seen. Mean-
while, £4832 of book debts (the figure
was written after deducting a reserve of
£6690) is the only earning asset to sup-
port £45,142 of capital.
After transferring £l3l from the re-
serve against debtors’ balances, and
charging £209 to preliminary exes., the
result of the year’s trading was a loss of
£376.
Toowoomba Permanent Building (Q.)
This is a mutual society which makes
advances to its borrowing members to
enable them to build, buy or
improve their homes. The loans are
made for a period of 16 years or more,
repayable at the rate of 3s. 9d. weekly
for each £lOO borrowed. There are no
shareholders. Funds are provided by
depositing members, who receive interest
at a rate which has varied from one-
quarter to three-eighths of one per cent,
below the rate paid by borrowers. No
bonuses and little or no income tax are
paid. Also, the business is conducted
at small cost, thus enabling a high rate
to be paid to depositors—6 p.c. last year ;
borrowers were charged 6 } p.c., the same
as for the previous term.
Considering the mutual nature of the
society and the fact that a house built
with money at p.c. is dearer than it
would be if the money cost, say, 5 p.c.,

Last year there was a net growth of
£16,005 in deposits as against a shrink-
age of £5863 in the previous term. New
advances totalled £51,415 (£6182 more
than for the previous term), and repay-
ments amounted to £2704 more than
that. The year’s excess of incomings
over outgoings, etc., was £485, which,
with a small unexplained addition, lifted
reserves to £17,710, or less than sixpence
in the pound of advances.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:

Advances have stepped down from
108.2 p.c. of deposits in 1924 to 96.4 p.c.
at the close of last accounts. To repre-
sent the other £26,000-odd of deposits,
etc., there were premises, in at £4889, up
£2849, and investments (mainly Govern-
ment securities and cash) totalling
£45,162, up £14,007. What the margin
of security for advances is the “Wild
Cat” does not know, but the fact that
neither foreclosures nor arrears of instal-
ments figure in the published accounts
suggests that the risks have been care-
fully selected.
Tin
Whether the international tin restric-
tion scheme will ultimately lead producers
in the signatory countries to paradise or
the other place depends largely upon the
practical vision of the committee which
controls it. Chief danger lies in trying
to prop up the price at too high a figure,
Slump brought about contraction in the
demand for the metal ; the industry,
like many others, found itself over-
equipped, and stocks broke down the
price. The average London spot quote
for the metal, which was £262 12s. 6d.
for the five years to the end of 1928,
fell to £llB 9s. Id. for 1931 ; it was £135
18s. 10d., 1932; and £194 11s. lid.,
1933 . The figure reached £243 17s. 6d.
early in April, and was £230 18s. 9d.
last week-end. The recovery has been
due to (1) the restriction scheme, and
(2) a sharp recovery in demand, chiefly
from the U.S.A.
Meanwhile there has been a substantial
reduction in the cost of producing tin.
Because of this and other things, the
board of Austral Malay, and others, too,
considers that “Malayan interests require
a much larger quota to increase visible
stocks and to bring about a reduction in
the price of tin to consumers, thus
further stimulating consumption, making
the use of substitutes less attractive and
increased production by non-signatory
countries more difficult.” For the same
reasons the co. opposed the formation of
a buffer pool.
Under the new international agree-
ment, the five signatory countries (British
Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Bolivia,
Nigeria and Siam) have agreed to con-
tinue control of the production and ex-
port of tin until the end of 1936. Siam’s
quota remains unchanged at 10,000 tons
p.a. until the others reach 65 p.c. of
their 1929 outputs. The quota of the
other four has been lifted from 33 1-3
p.c. to 40 p.c., plus another 4 p.c. for
1934. But, should supplies from non-
signatory countries exceed 25 p.c. of the
new quota for six consecutive months,
any signatory may withdraw on six
months’ notice, and the whole thing may
be abandoned.
Visible supplies are now at a level
which leaves little margin for emer-
gencies:—

The object of the buffer pool (8282 tons,
to be built up by the end of 1934) is to
iron out undue short-term fluctuations
in prices which may arise from variations
in monthly deliveries. Long-trend
fluctuations will be dealt with by raising
or lowering the quota. To build up
buffer stocks a special quota of 5 p.c.
of standard tonnages has been sanctioned
as from June 1.
Recently there has been a marked in-
crease in output in the American tin-
plate and motor-car industries, the two
chief users of the world’s tin; yet their
purchases of the metal have not increased.
This is attributed by opponents of re-
striction to the use of substitutes. It
seems more likely, however, that users
stocked up when prices were low. For
individual producers, immediate prospects
depend more upon quota allotments than
upon the price, provided the latter does
not fall too abruptly.
Equatorial Gold Exploration (New
Guinea-New Britain) has been formed to
hunt for gold-bearing formations in the
Mandated Territory. Dr. J. R. Atcherley
and A. Palmer, presumably mining men,
are to lead an expedition “to certain
territories where goid is stated to exist.”
The syndicate’s capital is £4OOO in £lO
shares, of which 225 are offered. The
consideration to be paid to Messrs.
Atcherley, Palmer and Smith (the last-
named the legal manager) is £250 cash
and 100 fully-paids.

North Queensland ’weight-chasers are
sitting up and taking notice of a new
alluvial find at Jordan Creek, about 20
miles west of Innisfail. The original
prospector has been getting £lOO a month
out of his claim for some time past, and
there are indications that the lead con-
tinues. The Jordan was proclaimed a
goldfield years ago, but the yellow metal
was so floury that, with the methods then
in use, most of it was lost. Hopes are
that the Government will lend a hand in
developing the new find, which is in the
middle of a large area of tropical scrub
land, recently thrown open for agricul-
tural settlement.

Gold Mines of Australia has com-
menced boring the Burdekin (Q.) allu-
vials ; the work was delayed by lateness
of the wet season. The co. is also prob-
ing river flats on the Gilbert (Q.), at
Adelong Creek (N.S.W.) and on the
Mitchell, near Glen Innes (N.S.W.).
Leases and options have been obtained
over deep leads near Allendale (Vic.), and
over ground traversed by the Buck reef,
one of the strongest lodes on the Ravens-
wood (Q.) field. Here diamond-drilling
and work underground have commenced,
and Mt. Coolon has a one-third interest
in the option. G.M.A.’s recently acquired
share interests in Victoria include 100,000
contribs. in the Morning Star, 50,000 in
Bendigo Mines and 10,000 in the
Napoleon.

Siamese Tin Syndicate, operating at
St. Helen’s (Tas.), won 30 tons of tin in
its first six months’ work. In addition,
two faces will be cleaning up shortly.
The t.o. is shipped to Penang for smelt-
ing. The results are satisfactory, as a
certain amount of poor ground had to
be worked. The co. spent about £50,000
on preliminary work, including a 30-mile
water-race, which has delivered an
adequate supply, despite the dry season.

The old Lady Shenton group, Menzies,
is among the latest Westralian floats. A
lost shoot has been found, and optimis-
tic reports by two mining men are in-
cluded in the prospectus. McCallum
Smith, of the “Sunday Times,” and Jack
Sutherland, formerly general manager of
Golden Horseshoe, have seats on the
board. Also, Sutherland has agreed to
act as consulting engineer; so far he has
not reported on the show.

“Oof Bird”: Chairman John Wadding-
ton’s statement at the recent statutory
meeting of Southern Cross Development,
“tHat the drill had proved values,” was
a bit premature. Boring has not yet
commenced. The drilling referred to
was done years ago by a local syndicate,
which, after striking values, was unable
at the then price of gold to induce capital
to lend a hand. It will be some time
before plant is installed.

Last year North Kalgurli (W.A.) in-
creased its capital from £75,000 to
£lOO,OOO by the creation of 250,000 new
2s. shares, which were snapped at ss. each.
Net receipts from treatment, etc.,
amounted to £44,876, of which deprecia-
tion, development and two divs. of 6d.
each took £44,390. With £13,098 brought
in £13,584 was carried forward. When
the books closed the co. had a cash bal-
ance of £65,169. An interim distribu-
tion from the current year’s earnings is
promised later. The year’s treatment
results represent the average grade of the
ore exposed in the mine, the chairman
says.

South Kalgurli (W.A.) continues to do
well, despite a reduction of £9364 in last
year’s net earnings (£84,304). An in-
terim of Is. and a final of Is. 6d. per
share are being sweetened with a bonus
of 2s. 6d., altogether equal to 100
p.c., and £20,000 is to be transferred
to reserves. Although the co.’s end was
said to be in sight years ago, it has
treated shareholders handsomely since,
and seems likely to continue to do so
for some time yet. The leased Croesus
Prop, has helped greatly to swell earn-
ings.

Golden Horseshoe’s pile of residues is
gradually disappearing. Since the begin-
ning of 1930 nearly half a million sterling
has been extracted from it, and at Sept.
30, 1933, there was still 1,007,983 tons to
be put through. This is being handled at
the rate of about 40,000 tons monthly.
According to a London statement, the
co.’s assets include £120,000 cash, £90,000
in Wiluna shares and £20,000 in other
scrip.

After an unsuccessful attempt to
develop the Iron Duke (Associated
Northern’s Golden Mile claim), the
Austral Co. has taken an option over the
North End mine, Kalgoorlie (W.A.),
known years ago as the Devon Consols
South Extended, and worked by Westralia
United Goldfields, Ltd. The property
has been opened to 300 ft., and the lodes
are patchy. The co. has also taken
options over two other leases on the
Kalgoorlie belt.

R. A. Duncan, chairman of Kanowna
Pug Deposits, which has a 320-acre con-
cession on the old W.A. field, says that a
hundred dumps sampled have assayed
from 2dwt. to 15dwt. a ton. The new
plant is being erected, but what results
will be got remains to be seen.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
Wolfram and molybdenite are quoted at 41s.
per unit and 36 5. per unit respectively. What
does this mean ? —5218.
In these cases a unit means a unit per
cent. A clean wolfram concentrate should
contain about 70 p.c. tungstic acid. At the
London quotation of 475. per unit, the price
per ton would be 47 X 70 = £164 10s. Molyb-
denite prepared for market is generally 85 p.c.
molybdenum sulphide. At 365. per unit the
price per ton would be 36 X 85 = £153. Aus-
tralian prices would depend upon margin
allowed by buyers for cost of transport,
insurance and realisation, etc.

“King for a Night”
Melb. State resounded with the heavy
breathing of amusement-seekers under
the stress of acute emotion when present
critic saw the above, and tears fell freely.
It is about Bud Gloves (Chester
Morris), a pug. On the night of the big
battle Bud’s beloved sister shoots his
manager, whose mistress, it appears, she
has been for some time. Bud erases his
sister’s fingerprints from the shooting-
iron and replaces them with his own.
Then he goes off to contest the world’s
title, the cops being sportsmen enough
to wait till he has k.o.’d his opponent
before making the arrest. Bud goes to
the condemned cell with his lips sealed.
His father, a parson, totters into the
prison at the last moment to give the
wayward lad spiritual consolation. Then
Bud marches proudly down the corridor
to the electric chair with his chest out,
calling the attention of other unfor-
tunates in their cages awaiting execution
to the gameness of his old man. The cur-
tain descends on the cleric tending the
daisies over a grave marked with a stone
bearing the legend “Bud, Champ, of the
World.” It has to be seen to be believed.
“Beloved”
This picture covers a vast amount of
territory, a long lifetime, contains a revo-
lution and three wars, yet manages to
hang consistently on the career of a
single character, Carl Hausmann (John
Boles). Carl, born a count, is destined to
be a musician, but the revolution of
1845 kills his father and sends his mother
fleeing to the Southern States of U.S.A.
The Civil War interrupts his studies, and
he emerges a ruined man who has to
play for a living in saloon bars. He
composes his great American Symphony,
but the Spanish-American War provides
another diversion and the Great War still
another. Jazz now submerges the public
ear, and Carl’s grandson rides on the wave
to wealth and eminence as a composer
of syncopated melodies pinched from the
old gentleman’s unpublished opuses.
Out of charity, the grandson gets the
Metropolitan to give the American Sym-
phony a performance, and, to his sur-
prise, it causes a furore. The veteran
composer dies in his box with the sound
of the applause beating on his eardrums.
The film is awkwardly constructed,
but the main impression succeeds in
struggling through it. Boles is practi-
cally the only person in it; he has a
voice, and he sings a good deal. It’s at
Melb. State.
“Channel Crossing”
This is the most satisfying British pic-
ture present critic has sat through.
Everything happens on a channel steamer
in a fog between Dover and Calais. A
financier (Matheson Lang) has tried to
prop his tottering fortune with forged
paper, and the news comes through that
the market has collapsed. Thousands,
including many of the ferry passengers,
are ruined, though they don’t yet know
it. The swindler’s secretary (Constance
Cummings) has been pursued by her
jealous lover (Anthony Bushell), who,
hearing of the crisis, gets pushed over-
board by the financier. He is picked up
half-drowned. The financier now turns
sentimental, and supplies the doctor with
the adrenalin which restores the young
man to life, and enables him to betray
his saviour. Lang dodges his creditors
for ever by suicide.
Matheson Lang makes his man a
symbol of the lust for power, which
finds expression in his belief in himself
as a public benefactor on whom humble
citizens depend for their subsistence. It’s
a fine study. Edmund Gwenn, among
others, gives the human side of the boat-
load of assorted characters, and the
camera is employed with great astute-
ness. The film is at Melbourne Majestic.
“The Witching Hour”
The period is pre-war, and the talkie
is a blend of melodrama, romantic
comedy and present-day thriller. Hyp-
nosis was a novelty quarter of a century
ago, so when young Tom Brown is put
on his trial for shooting the enemy of
his prospective father-in-law, John Halli-
day, the D.A. seems justified in reason,
if not in professional decency, in guf-
fawing at the defence. Sir Guy Stand-
ing, who, as Brown’s lawyer, is more like
a London silk than an American film
defender, drops to what has happened.
Halliday is a hypnotist and has uncon-
sciously willed the boy to do the deed.
The court scene in which Halliday
demonstrates his power over a derisive
juror succeeds in spite of the strangely
boorish behavior of the prosecutor.
Standing has a George Arliss part. He
plays with the ease and polish of Arliss
and he isn’t so actorish. Why no one has
made a star of him is one of the
mysteries of moviedom. Halliday is
almost as good. The only real trouble
with this film is that the finished methods
of Standing and Halliday make the work
of the others seem crude.
“We’re Not Dressing”
The chief justification for the above,
which follows “The Witching Hour” at
the Prince Edward, is the lowbrow
“20th CENTURY.”
Cat ole Lombard, as a prima donna, and John Barrymore, as a temperamental
playwright At Sydney Liberty.
humor. The plot is the one about the
wreck, the desert island and the cast-
aways who are bossed by their social
inferior, but all the traditional situations
are handled on farcical lines. Even the
wreck is comic. Bing Crosby is an A.B.
on a steam yacht. His conversational
crooning attracts Carole Lombard, but
she spurns his advances for a time.
Comic interludes are supplied by Leon
Errol (alcoholic owner of yacht), a per-
forming bear belonging to Crosby and
the vaudeville team Burns and Allen.
The basis of Gracie Allen’s universal
appeal is similar to that of Laurel, Hardy,
Charlie Chase, Fields —in fact, all the
leading clowns of the films. Practically
everybody has been exasperated by a
good-hearted, chattering imbecile like
Gracie. She and Burns have some up-
roariously funny business as naturalists
on the island. The fact that Crosby
looks masculine and is something of a
comedian makes his crooning less
nauseating than it might be ; but, even
so, there’s far too much of it.
“The Party’s Over”
Stuart Erwin is a public accountant
with an extravagant mother, a dissolute
father, a brother who chases waitresses
and a sister who admires a would-be
crooner.
While the family frivols Erwin works,
only letting up on Sundays and public
holidays, when he paints pictures. One
of his paintings gets an “honorable merf-
tion” and he talks of going to Paris to
study art. His parasitic relations are
appalled, but he walks out on them after
a brief struggle.
Erwin is eminently suitable for the
part, and the other players give him ex-
cellent support.
“Broadway Through a Keyhole”
This Sydney Regent attraction does
nothing to dispel the Hollywood-created
notion that Broadway is peopled exclu-
sively by theatrical employees and
gangsters.
Paul Kelly and his murderous satel-
lites represent gangsterdom ; the stage is
personified by Constance Cummings (a
strange mixture of innocence and sophis-
tication) and the usual wisecracking has-
beens and temperamental producer.
Kelly, though a murderer and a black-
mailer, is a “square-shooter” and a
“swell guy,” with the soft heart of a
good woman, so he causes Constance to
be promoted overnight from chorus girl
to leading lady in Texas Guinan’s
cabaret. Does Miss Cummings repay his
good offices with the gift of her love?
No! She becomes enamored of Russ
Columbo, a crooner. Russ is a miserable
creature even for a crooner, his currish-
ness contrasting painfully with the virile
gallantry of the bandit.
The fade-out shows Kelly, who has
risked his life for the girl he had lost, in
a hospital cot, blinking farewell to the
bright lights of Broadway. Moral: Better
die a brave bandit than live a white-
livered crooner.
“Strictly Dynamite”
An extravaganza at Sydney Capitol
which unfolds once again the sad story
of the young man who owed his suc-
cess to his wife and forgot her when it
came. Norman Foster is the husband.
He attains affluence by writing gags for
Schnozzle Durante, radio comedian.
Marian Nixon is the wife and Lupe Velez
is the hussy who comes between them.
The rehash is saved by Durante, who is
genuinely funny as a radio idol. Ster-
ling Holloway, as a telephone company
employee, provides a few laughs by being
himself.
“Fog”
Based on a “Saturday Evening Post”
serial, this thriller recounts the story of
the murder of a millionaire aboard an
Atlantic liner. The assassination is fol-
lowed by two others. An investigation is
conducted, apparently without any
authority whatever, by Donald Cook,
who himself falls under suspicion when
it is discovered that he is the million-
aire’s long-lost son. A spiritualistic
medium conducts a seance in creepy cir-
cumstances ; the ghost of one of the vic-
tims walks, and the identity of the mur-
derer is concealed till the last three
minutes. The foggy setting is consist-
ently insisted on —perhaps because there
is nothing else in the romance that is in
the least in tune with nature.
“Those Were the Days”
A film version of Pinero s “The Magis-
trate.” Claude Allister’s Captain Vale
is a delicious caricature of an army
officer of the ’nineties. The music-hall
with its M.C. and beer-drinking audi-
ence ; Posket, the magistrate, sentencing
his wife and sister-in-law to seven days;
and the 21-year-old Bobby showing his
step-father, who thinks he is 15, a bit of
life, are among the most enjoyable bits
of comedy that have been seen in a
British talkie. It’s at Sydney Civic as a
support to
“The Return of Bulldog Drummond”
Ralph Richardson’s Drummond isn’t
the Hugh Drummond of Sapper’s book.
Petersen, also, is different from the
original. Moreover, the thing has been
brought up-to-date; Drummond tells
Carl he won’t stand for any Stavisky
affairs in England, and so on. The
famous Black Clan is rigged out in a
semi-Fascist uniform, and Drummond is
un-British in his Fascist arrogance and
contempt of the law. On the other hand
the talkie has lots of quick action and
excitement.
Sundry Shows
An immense audience greeted Alice
Delysia at Melb. Princess on Saturday
with marks of extreme approval. No
such scenes of excitement have been
seen in any Melbourne theatre since
William Faversham lost his teeth at the
Comedy. The Frenchwoman may be
conveniently described as Mae West with
the nigger extracted, and she also recalls
Ada Reeve and Nellie Stewart in various
particulars. This is only to say that, like
those three ladies, she is that rare his-
trionic freak an actress with genuine, in-
stead of acquired, personality, which she
succeeds in putting across the footlights
triumphantly. Able to change her moods
with the speed of lightning, and equipped
with a beautiful body and a battery of
arch expressions and graceful gestures,
she does not disdain any sort of rough-
and-tumble if it suits her purpose. When
she produces some bit of hoydenishness,
she does it as if it had just occurred to
her and seemed interesting. In • short,
her performance is a feat of theatrical

ABORIGINALITIES
“Boka”: The chaps who do the cricket
broadcasting have no more appreciative
listener than Jacky, a stockman on a
station in North Westralia. As a great
favor he was permitted to listen far into
the night to the description of the first
Test, and he conceived a great admira-
tion for McCabe. “My cripes, boss, this
fellow McCabe plurry good cricketer,”

“M. McD.”: A parallel to the lark
killed by a bullet on the rifle-range (B.
20/6/’34): There used to be a rough-
and-ready golf course on land now the
property of the Waite Research Institute
(S.A.). I live opposite. One day I saw a
young man drive off, watch his ball land,
then drop his clubs with a shout and run
towards the spot. He brought back a
three-quarter-grown hare. The ball had
hit it on the back of the head as it
squatted.
“Newmoon”: The extinct moa of
old Maoriland had a crop-stone of its
own, which it disgorged in small piles.
One of these stones has just been found
near Wanganui, North Island ; the
strange thing is that it is of the trans-
parent type of greenstone peculiar to the
South. Was it disgorged by a moa in
some long-forgotten age when the two
islands were joined and the huge birds
were able to roam at large across what is
now Cook Strait? While this question
is being discussed, the crop-stone reposes
in the Wanganui Museum.

“Eyass”: A sparrowhawk, one of the
fiercest -and most formidable of the
small birds of prey, met more than
his match near Goulburn
(N.S.W.) recently when he
attempted to collect a chicken.
The hen beat off his first swoop
and shooed her brood under-
neath a near-by house. One
was a bit late and was nabbed
by the pirate, but before he
could get away the hen hopped
into him. There was a flurry of
feathers, and a very sick hawk
sought an adjacent tree, leaving
his booty behind, while the hen
joined her family triumphantly.
A human who had gone to get
a gun returned to find the hawk
lying dead under the tree, it
having bled to death from
wounds in the throat. Many instances
are recorded of game fowls having
beaten off hawks and other bandits, but
the heroine in this case is described as
just “an old, black barndoor hen.”

“Airline”: Food supply evidently
governs the selection of a site for an
ants’ nest. Ringbarking in Queensland,
I notice that almost every box-tree has
an ants’ nest of some description at its
bole. The box-tree is not only easily
accessible, but the ants gather much
largesse in the form of insect larvae,
which drop from the trees, prolific
breeding-grounds for an astonishing
variety of insects.
“Carlton”: The death of Andy the
giraffe at Melbourne Zoo from eating a
hairpin—where he could have got it from
these last dozen years the deuce only
knows—reminds me that the records in
this direction mostly go to emus and
ostriches. Like our old friend the
shark, whenever one of these dies a post-
mortem follows as the night the day.
One ostrich not long ago which pegged
out at Andy’s zoo of hoary old age had
enough metal content in his crop to
start a general dealer in business, the lot
including nails, coins, assorted chunks
of iron, bits of china and a watchchain
with several “medals” on it. An
emu at the same address must have heard
of the N.S.W. Government Savings Bank,
for her savings, Is. 6d. in coppers, were
in her crop when she died intestate. The
record at present is held by a Whipsnade
(Eng.) ostrich. His estate panned out
a gold necklace, two handkerchiefs, three
gloves, a film spool, a pencil, a comb, a
key, many nails, two collar studs (?),
five pennies and a Belgian franc.

“Ornis”: One curious result of the
adoption of petrol-engined motor-trains
on some of Sydney’s suburban lines is
that they have caused serious casualties
among the bird population. The steam-
and electric-trains are not notable in this
respect. Perhaps the birds are used to
them, or they make more noise, though

“Lugger’s Mate”: Sea-snakes do dig
their own burrows (B. 4/7/’34). They
can be seen at it any old day on the reef
flats of the Barrier Reef. I remember
the first time I saw one at work; it
made me gape with astonishment. I was
chasing it through 2in. of clear water
when suddenly it stopped short and
started to shrivel up from both ends.
Before it had got out of sight I realised
that it was simply disappearing into the
sand by the end nearer to me ; the distal
end was coming towards me —and get-
ting no nearer.
“First Brigade”: Though far from
complimented by his doubts as to my
veracity (B. 4/7/’34), I am obliged to
“Kelly” for his description of
a better method of catching
crows than that described by
myself. But I read all about
“Kelly’s” invention 40 years
ago in one of Kipling’s
earlier stories entitled “The
Strange Ride of Morrowby
Jukes.” Apart from its tips
as to crow-catching and
-cooking, the yarn is a fine
one in itself, and I recommend it to
“Kelly’s” attention.
“Jabiru”: “Kooragai” (B. 30/5/’34)
says the jabiru is now found only in the
far-north and n.-w. of Queensland. A few
years ago a fine pair of these birds took
up their quarters at the mouth of the
Mooloolah River, about 70 miles north
of Brisbane. Their canny methods of
working small fish into blind channels
in the sandbanks were worth watching.
Having got them there, one bird would
block the entrance by dancing and beat-
ing the water with its wings while the
other tucked into the fish. Of course,
the sportsman who delights in sitting
shots accounted for one of them, where-
upon the survivor disappeared. Another
pair have lately made their appearance,
and, as their stamping ground is now
a game sanctuary, they have a chance
of survival.
"Raja”: There may be sharks in Tas.
waters, but during my six years at
Georgetown, on the Tamar, no one wor-
ried. Even a frequent whale didn’t stop
the morning dip. But I’ll admit to cold
shivers not caused by the temperature
when the barracoutas were raging up and
down the river; they were the real
reason we abandoned the nude and took
to costumes.
“Pee Dee”: “De M.’s” reference to
penguins (B. 13/6/’34) reminds me of
happy holidays spent on Penguin Island
(W.A.), situated about a mile offshore
from Saiety Bay, near Rockingham.
There are actually penguins in occupa-
tion, and the isle boasts, oi boasted, corn-
fortable cave dwellings chopped out oi
the solid limestone. When I first went
there the sole inhabitant was old Sea-
forth McKenzie, good friend of the Boy
Scouts, of yachtsmen and of anyone
else who happened along. He spent
his winter months with the pick and
shovel in his caves making them bigger,
better and brighter toi his summei visi-
tors, and never crabbed the tun by his
simple theology. It was a revelation to
see a full muster of yachties and (isher-
men assembled in his spacious cave loi
a service, which he conducted in his own
inimitable style. It was never long or
boring, and generally finished up with a
sing-song. I heard recently that old age
had driven Mac to a hut on the main-
land, and that the caves and tunnels of
which he was so proud are falling in
and becoming uninhabitable, except by
the penguins and goannas.

“Wang”: A rat was crawling through
a hole in the paling fence which separates
my neighbor’s back garden from my own.
Suddenly he gave a squeal, and began to
twist and jump about frantically, but
seemed unable to pull away. A couple
of taps with the hoe handle settled his
hash for good ; but when I went to gather
him up on a spade I found he was a
fixture. My neighbor’s pet kookaburra,
his two feet braced against the plinth,
had half the rat’s tail in his beak and a
look of determination in his eye. He had
dived on to the supposed worm while
its owner was surveying me on the other
side of the fence. Even as I looked at
him Jack gave an extra tug and fell back-
wards with the dead rat on top of him.
He was still laughing half an hour after-
wards.
* * * *
“Xover”: The other day I noticed
a blowfly on his back making Catherine-
wheels in the dust. Two meat ants
looked on. At the first lull they dived in.
One made good his grip ; the second was
heaved inches into space. He returned to
the attack, and, when next the fly stopped
for breath, he hooked on. Furious,
intermittent merry-go-rounding con-
tinued for some time ; then a third ant
joined battle. Apparently he got a death
grip, for soon he was dragging off the
corpse while Nos. 1 and 2 staggered
dizzily behind.

“Bunny”: “Te Bab.” (B. 6/6/’ 34)
needn’t go to mid-Pacific islands to find
places unsuited to rabbit-propagation.
During the ’nineties Government placed
rabbits, goats and cocoanut-trees on
groups of islands along the Queensland
coast, the idea being to provide tucker
for shipwrecked mariners. The wrecks
never came. The goats did well till
luggers, fishermen, islanders and others
discovered there was good and free
mutton on tap. The cocoanuts thrived on
a few of the islands. But on not one of
them did the rabbit survive long enough
to call himself a grandpa.
“Bucko”: Three years ago a lady
released a pair of bunnies on Phillip
Island, four miles from Norfolk. Cotton-
tails became so numerous that they ate
themselves out of house and home,
destroying the beautiful hibiscus-trees for
which Phillip Island was renowned.
To-day almost all the vegetation and
rabbits have gone.
WOULDN’T HAVE IT ON HIS MIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Joe the cook’s a handy soul with pot and
pan, as all attest;
He'll sling a stew or bake a duff with any
craftsman in the West.
But should you seek to learn his views on
aught outside his job you’ll find
He’s one unvarying formula: “I wouldn’t have
it on me mind.”
He knows, I fancy, more than most of us about
his fellow-man,
In one particular at least, as a receptacle for
scran.
But there his study’s stopped, and if you ask
him about womankind
You needn’t be surprised to hear he “wouldn't
have ’em on his mind.”
There’s not the faintest use in an appeal to
Joe, when tongues wax hot
About the Douglas Credit scheme and whether
it is punk or not;
No verdict will you get from him, not though
you argue till you’re blind,
Excepting the ambiguous one: “I wouldn’t have
it on me mind.”
He takes scant stock in politics, and why a
sober man should go
Wild with excitement over games remains a
mystery to Joe.
Who does he think will win the Tests? He’ll
grunt his blackened pipe behind,
And give you the assurance square he “wouldn’t
have ’em on his mind.”
These Labor squabbles leave him cold. It’s
hard to think he’d care a hang
If Lang should queer Jim Scullin’s pitch or
Scullin get the bulge* on Lang.
And, sound him about Page and Lyons, you’ll
gather that he’s disinclined
For any preference involved by having either
“on his mind.”
We met in town, did Joe and I, and just how
many drinks we had
I can’t recall, but I surmise the stuff must have
been pretty bad.
I hazarded my doubts to Joe when up to graft
next day we lined.
“Too right,” he said, “call that tack beer! 1
wouldn’t have it on me mind.”
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.


“Minstrel”: One can only go to the
original ballad to find just where it is
that the dog-and-tucker-box episode
occurred (B. 4/7/’34). There it is dis-
tinctly stated that it was nine miles from
Gundagai. Also, before the ballad was
bowdlerised it ascribed to the canine a
different performance. If the people who
had that monument erected had only
troubled to refer to the original text they
might have thought twice before
doing so.

“Tom Willie”: What is a pademelon?
In the Leeton (N.S.W.) irrigation district
just now hundreds of acres are covered
with dead vines and their not yet dead
offspring—countless inedible fruit. They
resemble gooseberries, have a rind like
a melon and are covered with unchari-
table spikes. To all ’Bidgee dwellers
they are known indisputably as pade-
melons. Collins’s Dictionary gives the
definition “a name of certain kanga-
roos”; and Webster defines the useless
fruit as an Australian wallaby or a nail-
tailed wallaby. I don’t want to argue
about it, but a whaling cobber of mine
(a vulgar fellow whose friendship
was thrust upon me) grins wisely
at any reference to a pademelon having
legs. He won’t even allow a tail, but
hops—yes, he’d never oppose the possi-
bility of hops.

“Bogaduck”: Anything which throws
the business of the hive out of gear will
cause the worker bees to kill the drones.
A sudden rain shutting off a honey flow,
a dearth of pollen, a prolonged cool
change or being shifted to a new loca-
tion and opened again will cause the
old-maid workers to take it out of the
menfolk.
* * *
“Petrel”: Victorian naturalists are
interested in the fact that a mutton-bird
has been discovered out in the Mallee.
This is remarkable, since the sooty petrel
“No, it ain’t, mum. The Strathnaver’s round the corner.”
is a seabird pure and simple, and only
comes ashore in the nesting season, when
millions of him and her throng the small
islands off the east coast, from Bass Strait
to the Barrier Reef. Except in the nest-
ing season, the fowl ranges the Pacific,
and in the winter is found as far north as
Vancouver. If this particular specimen
desired to settle on the land, it seems to
me it would have been better if he
had picked the Riverina.
•
Old Q.”: Seeing some of the new
breeds of sheep at the Sydney show, I
am convinced that nothing is beyond the
scope of our sheepmen. If the mutton-
bird found in the Vic. Mallee could be
crossed with the mutton sheep, most of
the problems attaching to the export of
our fat lambs would be solved. When
mustered, mobs of the new breed could
be flown overseas and delivered on the
wing, so to speak, at Smithfield. Of
course, there is always a catch some-
where, and droving would be the problem.
Still, in these days of aeroplanes and
similar gadgets, we might be able to
evolve a Mutton-bird' Mick to take the
place of Saltbush Bill.
* • * * *
“Shipwreck”: “Valerin’s” Wangaratta
farmer couldn’t use that paddock (B.
4/7/’34) for fear of stock being killed by
landing aeroplanes. The old chap was
almost blind ; there was only one horse
he could ride, and when it was killed by
a ’plane the posts were erected in protest.
Not long afterwards a ’plane was wrecked
when trying to alight in the paddock, and
the pilot severely injured.
* # * *
“Y.0.Y.”: It’s unusual for an albatross
to alight on the deck of a ship, but when
the Tongariro was in mid-ocean a bird,
weakened from illness, landed on the
fo’c’sle deck. It became seasick and
refused food, but stayed aboard all night.
It measured 13ft. from tip to tip, and
next day it took two men to drop it
over the ship’s side to help it into the
air. Other birds straightway attacked it.
Off the coast of Africa a flock of quail
alighted on the same ship and stayed
aboard for several days. Many died,
others left, but one grew tame, accepting
food and allowing the mate to take it
out of the cold at night. It was put
ashore in Africa.
* * * *
“Tripod”: “Pandanus” (B. 4/7/’34),
when he. pitched camp in pouring rain
on the Starcke (Q.), would have, like any
bushman, covered the floor of his tent
with small leafy branches to keep his
ground-sheet above the sodden earth.
The mossies no doubt were sheltering
under the leaves, and when in the tent
came forth and attacked. I had a similar-
experience in a survey camp in the ranges
behind Cairns.
* * * *
“Pack vSaddle”: “Top-rail” is* right
about Chinks being banned on the Clon-
curry and other Queensland goldfields
(B. 4/7/’34), but his mysterious Chinese
workings in those parts is explain-
able. Despite the ban, hundreds were
found on all the fields as far north
as the Palmer and the Starcke —some-
times with a rope around their
necks. Before the Cloncurry and Borah
fields were opened up hundreds of
Chinese came through the district, and
most of them were polished off by abos.
On Lake Nash and some other stations
they were mustered and driven back from
the district, with' the exception of about
50. These were conscripted by the man-
ager of Lake Nash to build a dam across
Nararni Creek. A remnant of the dam
may still be seen as a limestone wall
across the creek.
“A.C.G.”: A warning to newchums.
A bush-bred friend of mine had a habit
of picking snakes up by the tail and
breaking their backs with a “whip-crack”
action. Coming upon an Bin. brown
snake which was lying sleepily in the sun,
I tried. Either I was too slow or the
wriggler was too quick; anyway, it got
in first. The subsequent ligature nearly
cut through my poisoned finger, and an
incision did take a slice off the top of it;
then there was a 20-mile dash to the
nearest doctor. Moral (if any): Start on
the larger (and slower) snakes before
trying the easier-looking small fry.
“Bananalonga”: Against “W.P.T.’s”
dogwood, crushed wattle-seed and wild
damson I nominate the Gympie stinging-
plant of Queensland. It packs a sting
that would do credit to an outsize hornet.
The pain lasts weeks, sometimes months.
“ Dammit, they’ll never believe me!”
A whiff of “Gympie” causes profuse
running of eyes and nose, a feeling
of intense hunger, and a severe and
obstinate bout of sneezing. A hundred
sneezes in twenty minutes was the per-
formance of a young schoolmistress of
the D’Aguilar Ranges before she left for
hospital. Her pupils had concealed a
few Gympie leaves in her desk for a lark.
Sin bringeth not its own punishment
always, evidently, for the kids got two
days’ holiday while a relief teacher was
arranged for.
“Coen”: There seems to be a
lot of unnecessary fuss in the
papers because bush abos. cut
open the back of one who had
left the tribe for civilisation,
with the result that the patient
died. Irresponsibles freely assert
that the rite is analogous to the
other abo. practice of extracting
the kidney-fat from a dead or
living enemy and devouring it.
That was supposed to give the
eater all the virtues of the eaten
in addition to his own, and was
a peculiarly selfish proceeding.
The back-cutting and bleeding
process is for the benefit of the
person operated upon. In this
case it was a cleansing rite de-
signed to wash away the sins of
one who had abjured tribal con-
trol and mocked at tribal law.
Whatever the ultimate result, the
decision is swift. In the case of
more civilised communities the
man who breaks union or party
laws has a much longer row to
hoe and stranger opposition to
suffer before he can win back.
“Wang”: “Y’ can nearly always git out
of an awkward position if y’ use yer nut,”
remarked Harry the Liar. “I was out
parrot-nestin’ in a paddick where a cocky
kept a coupler frisky bulls, and had a
rope an’ an axe with me. I was just
gettin’ ready to shin up a tree when I
hears a bellerin’ behind. Th’ long-
horned devils were makin’ fer me. I
scooted fer th’ nearest fence ; but it was
too far off—they’d ’a’ had me before I
was half-way there. Then I spotted a
big holler log about six foot through an’
twenty foot long—just a big shell, it was.
I dived into it with me rope an’ axe,
just in time. But there I was, bailed up.
One o’ them bulls got at one end of th’
log an’ th’ other at th’ other end, an’ there
they stood with their heads shoved in,
glarin’ an’ snortin’ at me. But I used me
nut. I made a loop at one end of me
rope, an’ sneakin’ along dropped it over
th’ horns of one of th’ bulls an’ pulled
it tight. Then I slithered along to th’
other end, an’ after a bit of jugglin’ got
a loop around th’ other feller’s horns,
an’ pullin it tight knotted the rope ; an’
there I had th’ pair of ’em tied to each
other an’ pullin’. Then I got me axe
an’ chopped a hole through th’ side o’
th’ log. But I lorst me rope.”

“A.W.U.”: Always thought the anni-
hilation of the wild turkey in Centralia
could be blamed on the fox, but an ex-
squatter told me that the bird’s extinc-
tion was due to grasshoppers. _ He had
come across turkeys, he said, on a
Riverina station staggering about the
landscape, and, holding a post-mortem on
several, found their gizzards perforated
with the elbow joints of the hoppers’
main legs, which are as hard as bent
wire.

“Herpeton”: The attention of those
sturdy Aboliars who maintain that snakes
swallow their young for protection is
directed to an offer of £5 by one Ernest
Austin, of Booiyalloak (Vic.), to anyone
who can produce a snake with the young
swallowed and unharmed. Conditions
are that the snake must be killed by a
whack on the head and a string immedi-
ately tied round its neck, after which it
is to be forwarded to Melbourne “Argus.”
A similar offer has been standing in
Britain for many years. No one has ever
claimed the cash.
“Tom Willie”: A poem called “Not
Understood” was written a long time
ago for the benefit of fellows like my-
self. We certainly need all the comfort
it may provide us with. The snake I
ploughed up was neither a lizard nor a
blind worm, as “V. Ralia” (B. 4/7/’34)
suggests. At first I thought it was a
long stout root of a missing gum-tree,
but when I started to chop it for the
afternoon billy fire it squealed like a pig
and, with its big homely eyes, looked
up at me pathetically. I hitched the
horses to it and dragged it into the
furrow and ploughed it over. That’s
the truthful, kindly sort of fellow I am.

“A.S.”: “Nepa” (B. 20/6/’34) upholds
Lakekamu (Papua) as the world’s wettest
spot. I nominate Cherrapunji (N.E.
India) as being moist enough to make
Lakekamu look like the heart of Sahara.
The village (alt. 4300 ft.) is at the head
of a valley in the Khasi Hills (Assam),
and is the dumping-ground for the sur-
plus rains of the s.-e. monsoon. Average
annual rainfall is 428 in., of which 195 in.
falls in June and July. Monthly figures
from April to September read: 30.8,
46.2, 96.8, 98.2, 76.5 and 46.1 inches.
BRIGHT WINTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, soft the winds of morning are,
The thin air sweet and bracing,
With sunshine gilding from afar
The mountains I am facing;
The frost’s still white upon the grass,
And from the slowly swinging
Green branches of the trees I pass
A hundred birds are singing.
Let bards, in many a lilting line,
To spring their homage render.
For me, I drink the air like wine,
I see the glowing splendor
Of wattle-trees ablaze with bloom,
With golden glory freighted,
And wonder why folk think that gloom
And winter are related.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
KIKUYU GRASS.
“Honi Pikau”: I have tried it in
Maoriland, and my impressions are not
as favorable as those formed by M.O.L.
contributors in Australia.
It certainly makes great growth in the
summer and autumn, and- is the best
drought-resisting grass I have seen. But
in M.L., at least, the first winter frosts
kill it, and it doesn’t come away again
till late spring. That means that for
three or four months of the year it has
no grazing value whatever.
Superior to a Kikuyu pasture, in my
opinion, is a pasture composed of pas-
palum, white clover and perennial rye-
grass. The clover and rye-grass will
give an appreciable amount of feed in
winter months, come away vigorously in
the spring, and continue at their maxi-
mum till midsummer. The paspalum
will supply ample feed thence-forward till
late autumn. In effect, such a pasture
will give feed for 12 months in the
year against eight or nine months from
Kikuyu.
The paspalum-rye-grass-clover pasture
should be top-dressed at least once a year
(preferably twice) and kept well eaten
down, especially in the summer and
autumn months, otherwise the paspalum
is likely to choke out the rye-grass and
clover. Such a pasture should also be
frequently harrowed to prevent undesir-
able sod-bound conditions from paspa-
lum growth.
In my opinion paspalum, properly
managed, is the best grass south of the
Line. Improperly managed, it’s one of
the worst.
BULL MITCHELL GRASS.
“J.R.D.”: I agree with “Haddington ’
(B. 27 /6/ ’34) that sheep—merinos, at any
rate —do better in big paddocks provided
the country is well watered; but his
championing of bull Mitchell as sheep
feed in preference to curly Mitchell and
Flinders grass is rather astonishing.
I have watched paddock sheep and
travelling sheep from the Barcoo to the
Barkly Tableland walking past bull
Mitchell with their heads in the air, but
stopping to graze as soon as they hit
curly Mitchell or to mop up the Flinders
grass between. Bull Mitchell becomes
more palatable after it has been burnt
off or eaten down several times, but on
the Barkly Tableland when the country
was getting bare you could pick out the
untouched patches of bull Mitchell,
whereas the curly Mitchell around was
eaten down to the sticks. In any case,
the Mitchell grass of the N.T. is not so
sweet or so palatable when dry as the
grass in C.Q.
I have brought Territory-bred horses
in poor condition down through C.Q.
They have picked-up on feed that they
could not have worked on at home.
Whether the N.T. grasses would become
equally good if they had been stocked
to the same extent is hard to say, but
sheep imported to the N.T. take a long
time to settle down and have to be care-
fully watched during the acclimatisation
period.
CLASSING DUSTY WOOL.
“M. and T.”: This is a job in which
it nearly always pays to take out the
backs, especially in the case of road
sheep and sheep off “red” country and
mulga.
The main part to take out is from the
butt of the tail to just over the rump. In
odd cases of open-wool sheep, one might
have to go right up the centre of the
back to the neck. This work can be done
easily and quickly, either on the wool-
table or the classer’s table. If on the
latter the fleeces need to be doubled right
over, having the two sides together, and
then rolled.
The wool on the rump of road sheep
is often tender, tippy and mushy. The
action of sheep walking along moves the
dust in the wool, and this wears the
fibres. This wool clearly shows up under
a magnifying-glass, and is only too often
apparent to the naked eye. It pays now
and then to remove it when the
sheep have had a bad time, especially
during the hot months, as the staple is
often much shorter than the rest of the
fleece. Unfortunately, this work cannot
always be carried out owing to the
present contract system.
REPRODUCTIVE POWERS IN
SHEEP.
“W.D.McC.”: Here is an instance I
can vouch for. When the late R. Henry
was manager of Bala Hill, part of the
Bolinda Vale property of Vic.’s only
baronet, Sir William Clarke, he had a mob
of 4000 ewes, cast for age, grazing on
what was then known as the “Bleak-
house” paddock for the purpose of being
fattened-off. Making his weekly inspec-
tion, he found an old Lincoln ram which
had evidently strayed in from a neigh-
boring property amongst them. He cut
the ram’s throat.
The season set in dry. As the flock
did not fatten it was decided to keep
them for shearing. In due time 450
lambs were dropped within a week.
GALLING.
“Valerin”: It pays io buy harness
that will wear well and fit well, and only
a saddler who specialises in this work
can supply it. Next, care of harness is
important; carefully washing the sweat
off and rubbing into the leather just as
much animal fat as can be absorbed
will keep it soft and pliable and prevent
cracking. A little good polish protects
the stitching from rotting.
The two main causes of galling are
pressure and friction ; to overcome this
the careful man will keep his horses in
hard condition. Obviously, horses over-
worked and underfed, or underworked
and overfed, become fit subjects for galls.
Suitable feeding (for hand feed, oats are
superior to most grains), regular groom-
ing (not merely a rub over the shoulders)
and cleanliness generally are essential if
the animals are to be kept in condition
for work.
Adjustment of the saddle when chafing
on the back is noticeable, or tying back
the girth when a gall is first seen, will
prevent serious trouble. Hideous sores
on horses’ sides may be overcome by &
slight adjustment of the draft to prevent
friction by the traces or chains.
Shoulder galls can be checked by using
proper fitting collars ; they should not
rest on the neck in front of the withers,
and they should bear evenly on the
shoulder blades. Between the inside of
the body of the collar and the neck there
should be just enough space to put in
the fingers, and the depth between throat
and neck the hand and wrist.
COLTC IN HORSES.
“Rich. J.”: Drinking cold water when
the horse is hot from work, overloading
the stomach with indigestible food, con-
stipation and mouldy hay are all contri-
butory causes. After hard feed never
turn the horse out to gorge on fresh
green fodder. This sets up a gas.
The symptoms are manifold. The
animal will sweat, groan, tremble and
make futile attempts to pass water. Often
the normal depression between hips and
ribs will look swollen, and the horse
will roll over in pain.
Any one symptom is not indicative of
the malady, but if more than one appear
the owner can rest assured that colic is
the cause.
The best treatment is to rug the horse
in a large stable with enough room to
enable him to roll about without hurt.
Feed on bran or warm bran-mash, with
lukewarm water to drink. In bad cases
administer an injection of warm soapy
water and turpentine, forced into the
back passage.
For ordinary cases a good drench is
to be recommended.
POTASH MANURES.
“Kilkivan”: There is widespread ig-
norance in Australia of the properties of
potassic manures. The points can be
simply put:' —
(1) Sir John Russell, of Rothamsted,
states that the dominant factor in turn-
ing acid of fruits, vegetables or seeds
into starch or sugar is sunlight. It is
now definitely established that, in regions
where sunlight is limited, potash assists
in the formation of starches and sugars.
In countries where there is plenty of sun,
the effect of potash is very slight. In
other words, potash makes up for
deficiency of sunlight.
(2) It is further established that the
effects of potash on yield are more
noticeable in bad years than good. In
years where yields are low all round,
potash plots win ; in years where yields
are high all round they lose.
(3) Potatoes are notorious devourers
of potash, but a classical series of ex-
periments in Victoria showed that potash
actually depressed the yield.
In England and Northern Europe
potash is heavily used. It is just as im-
portant there as phosphates are to us.
Along the Murray Valley where sul-
tanas are grown, there have been two
instructive seasons. In 1932-33 growers
had a very cool, dull summer, with
a minimum of days up to lOOdeg. ; in
1933-34 they had a hot, sunny summer,
with a maximum of days over lOOdeg.
The sultanas in the latter crop showed up
to two degrees more sugar in their
Beaume test than in the 1932-33 season.
Moreover, in 1932-33, which was cool
and dull, of six separate blocks being
studied by the C.S.I.R. in one district,
only one used potash manures. This one
had a far higher sugar test in the grapes
than the others. Possibly a coincidence,
but it supports the sunlight theory.
PEGGING OUT AN ORCHARD.
“Mcß.”: The difficulty of correctly
pegging out a young orchard can be
overcome by means of a planting wire.
You need a piece of galvanised-wire
the length of the bed to be planted. If
this is much more than 100 yards, it is
best to peg out in two or more sections.
If the spacing of the trees is to be 20
feet, drop a spot of solder every 20 feet
along the wire; if 15ft. or 20ft., spot
accordingly. Run the wire out along
the line of the first row of trees, and
put a peg at every spot of solder. Then
run the wire off at right-angles and put
the next line of pegs in. Continue with
the next headland, and, to keep your bed
dead square, see that your diagonals are
equal.
When you have the four headlands
pegged out, it is simple, with the help of
a boy, to run your wire from opposite
pegs at the headlands and slam the in-
termediate pegs in at each spot of solder.
The wire can be coiled up and put away
and used for a lifetime. It saves much
time in even a small orchard.
DEPTH OF SOIL.
“Cockyson”: Other things being equal,
depth of soil is generally regarded as an
indication of fertility, but it is not neces-
sary in all cases. Farming has been suc-
cessfully practised on soils of compara-
tively shallow depth, 12in. to 15in. soils
producing such crops as maize, lucerne,
pumpkins, potatoes, oats and barley.
Some of the most prosperous farming
districts in southern Queensland consist
of hilly , brigalow scrub soils, with a stiff
yellow-clay subsoil approaching to within
12in. of the surface. On hilly farms the
yellow clay is sometimes turned up by
extra-deep ploughing ; but the cropping
properties of the land do not appear to
be thereby affected. When the Fassifern
scrub was thrown open for selection
round about 60 years ago, wiseacres pre-
dicted that the land —most of it stiff
black soil about 18in. deep—would be
worthless after producing a crop or two.
But after more than half a century of
intense cultivation the Fassifern scrub
farms are still doing well.
No matter how deep the soil, only a
few inches of surface layer is turned
over by the plough, and the roots of cul-
tivated crops other than lucerne and fruit
trees do not penetrate below the depth
worked. Until the tractor came the aver-
age depth to which the soil was turned
over on the average heavy-soil farm was
2\m. to 3in. In Queensland sugar-grow-
ing areas alluvial soils are ploughed to
a depth of 18in. But deep soils, with a
porous or rocky subsoil, are required for
citrus.
A SLIDE FOR SNIGGING TIMBER.
“Bendee”: The best type is made out
of boiler plate, and may be up to 3ft.
wide, according to size of timber to be
drawn. The boiler plate is turned up at
one end after the shape of a road scoop.
Near the top of this turned-up end there
is a slot big enough to allow the snigging
chain to pass through. A big link pre-
vents the chain drawing right through
front of plate.
For use, the nose of the log or logs is
brought over edge of slide/ Chain is
fastened round log, through slot in front
of slide, and connected with the team.
Chain should be set so that nose of log
does not ride right up to front of slide,
as this allows plenty of play for it to
ride up over stones or other obstructions.
Where a man has not much timber to

handles out, and turn scoop back to
front. Put nose of your log on scoop,
pass chain through the draw-link on
the scoop arm, and then hook up. Your

will prevent your tracks being cut up.

ATTENTION
seeds of this weed in a number of second-
hand bags. So Westralian farmers are
warned that in buying such sacks they
run a risk.
Under the Noxious Weed Act, it is an
offence to send to any part of Westralia
from any other part any noxious weed,
or any portion of seed of such. When
bags infested with this weed are distri-
buted the department intends to take
proceedings.
THE TANK BOTTOM.
“Overflow”: One of the greatest
problems with an iron receiving-tank is
to preserve a dry bottom on which it is
to stand. First the stand is built. The
tank, be it any particular size, is built
on top of that. Rain comes ; the tank
overflows; anything happens and that
tank is sitting on a wet stand.
In spite of tarred felt and other things
no iron bottom will stand wet earth be-
neath it without rotting and rusting. All
sorts of gadgets have been employed to
ensure that dry stand, and they are all
more or less futile, to say nothing of
being expensive. The easiest of the lot,
the most practical and the only one
which gives perfect protection with effi-
ciency and economy is so simple that
the wonder is it is not universal.
Here is the tank, with a diameter of
anything from a few feet up to eight or
ten yards. The stand beneath it is built
with a half-sheet of corrugated iron,
filled with earth, levelled off. And
usually that stand is anything from an
inch to a foot greater in diameter than
the tank which is to rest on top of it.
That verandah all round collects the rain,
overflow and other moisture.
Instead of having a verandah on the
stand reverse it and put the eaves on the
tank. Make the stand about an inch less
in diameter than the tank. The tank
itself then serves as its own roof to pro-
tect its own stand. That overlap, small
though it if, suffices to throw off all
water and to keep the bottom dry.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Doitnow”: To get the grass quicker
after rain, such as has fallen lately, take
stock off as much country as you can,
and hand-feed. Paddocks thus not only
get a spell and freshen up, but the grass
is soon long enough to keep the sheep
going, provided there is more rain to
follow the first fall. Stock also do better,
and when put back on the cleansed pad-
dock they thrive.
“Karaway”: Oil-drums and petrol-
tins, filled with concrete and stood on
top of the ground, make better founda-
tion blocks for a haystack-stand than
wood or bricks. Mice can’t climb them,
so there is no need of a protecting fence
of galvanised iron. Old cream-cans with
the neck taken off are also suitable.
“Col Catchpenny”: Don’t be over-
zealous in grooming your unrugged
horses while the cold weather lasts,
unless they must look smart. Their long
hair collects dust, but it helps to keep
their bones warm.
“Fulcrum”: If coils of wire must be
left in the paddocks for lengthy periods
see they are kept clear of the ground by
laying horizontally across logs or sus-
pending from posts. Many weaknesses
in fences can be traced to wire having
been stood on the ground to become
partly embedded in mud when rain falls.
Corrosion sets in under such conditions.
“M.H.R.”: To keep the cow’s tail
quiet when milking, saw pieces of batten
into Bin. lengths for required number of
bails, and saw a “V” out of one end of
each piece. Put a saw-cut from the
centre of “V” down about 2in. and nail
on top rail of bail at tail-end. Tip of
tail drawn through this will be held
securely, and yet be comfortable for cow
and milker.
“Cow Cocky”: Saw a novel way of
dressing a sore and swollen udder and
festered teats on an Illawarra (N.S.W.)
farm. Mrs. Cowfarmer had fashioned
covers for the teats, a sort of glove and
bag, into which the udder fitted, the
whole being laced with tapes over the
cow’s back. The local vet.’s treatment
had to be applied hot each night, and
the gadget worked well.
“Booraby”: A good plan with heifers
is to yard them with the cows before
they calve, and get them used to the bails
by putting them through the pass-out
gates. They can be got quiet enough to
handle in the yard, and, when the
time comes for breaking-in, they may be
got into the bail without roping. Don’t
rope if you can avoid it, and never be
in a hurry with a young cow —nor leave
her till the last with no mates in the
yard.
“Bundilla”: My experience of vaginal
eversion differs from that of “F.L.8.” (B.
13/6/’34). I have found it more pre-
valent in bad seasons, and have success-
fully treated ewes weeks after the occur-
ence—though the sooner the better,
of course. The operation should be per-
formed with hindquarters in a higher
position than body, and try to keep ewe
in a recumbent position for an hour or
so afterwards. An antiseptic astringent
dressing is essential; with speedy con-
traction it will be unnecessary to put
stitches in.
“Boka”: Farmers with small flocks are
apt to neglect to take urine-stained wool
from the wether bellies before baling. If
the stained portion is left in it injuriously
affects the sale. It should be carefully
pulled off and thrown in with the stained
pieces. Bellies will present a better
appearance on the wool floor if they are
rolled—and it is a small matter to roll
or twist them with the clean wool out.
“Curlew”: For a wire key, get a piece
of flat iron, about 6|in. long by lin.
wide and |in. thick. Near one end drill
a hole to take No. 8 wire ; at the other
cut a narrow strip off each edge for £in.,
leaving slightly projecting points on
extreme outsides. Bend that end into a
hook that will hang on the largest wire
to be spliced. Hole may be used to
take wire to be spliced ; where telephone
splice is to be made, hang key on wire
with free wire in a notch. Turn key
backwards and a neat splice is made
quickly and well.
“Bullant”: Carry common salt in
your pocket if you value your dog when
lambing is on and poisoning rampant.
If he shows sign of strychnine poisoning
force a good handful immediately down
his throat, holding the mouth wide open
and pushing it down with your finger.
Apply artificial respiration also if you
don’t know how many fits he’s had. This
method has proved effective even after
the second fit. I’ve seen one mong
poisoned six times in a fortnight, and still
alive enough to have a bait at least once
every lambing.
“Jerry”: When bagging produce on
the farm, instead of bunching mouths of
bags and tying with twine try hooks made
of 4in. of fencing wire like wide staples,
with lin. prongs, bent towards each other
at an angle of 45 degrees. Fill bags,
hook staple in one side of mouth, pull
tightly together and hook into other side.
This method will give you far more
potatoes, corn-cobs and so forth in each
bag, and the bags will stand rough
handling.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
(1) How is coral burnt for lime ? (2) Approx,
yield per cwt. of coral ? (3) How would this
lime be used to make a sort of concrete ?
(4) Proportions of lime, sand and aggregate for
walls of a copra drier ? —2445.
(1) Coral consists mainly of carbonite of lime.
When the latter is strongly heated or burnt
it forms oxide of lime or quicklime. The
burning of limestone and similar material is
generally carried out in properly constructed
kilns. For small-scale burning, excavate about
10ft. into a bank, making the sides of the
excavation act as the three sides of a kiln;
lay about 18in. of wood on the bottom, then
about 18in. of the broken coral, filling up the
excavation with alternate layers of wood and
coral. The wood is then lighted from the
bottom, and the intense heat produced will
gradually burn the lime carbonate in the coral,
forming quicklime. (2) About 501 b. to each
cwt. of coral burnt. (3) and (4) It would take
too much space to explain these matters here.
Sydney Technological Museum will supply you
with information.
Did Clement Wragge make a weather fore-
cast for years after 1928 ? —2250.
Mr. Wragge’s last published forecast (May,
1915) was: “After 1920 the rainfall will begin
to steadly fall off, and the worst of the next
great under-average periods will be in 1923
and 1924, and Australians will be justified in
calling it a ‘drought.’ In 1925 matters will
again begin to improve, and good seasons will
prevail from 1926 to 1930 inclusive.” Mr.
Wragge died on December 11, 1922.
My dog is suffering from a red and inflamed
condition of the skin, the redness temporarily
disappearing on pressure. The condition is
noticeable on the inside of the flaps of the
ears, and inside of thighs and arms. It is
accompanied by a good deal of burning and
irritation, which makes the dog lick and bite
himself. What can be done for him ? —2376.
Symptoms point to erytheme. Dust over with
boracic powder often, or bathe parts with
thymol lotion. Treat for worms and give sul-
phate of magnesia, from five grains to one
scruple, and reduced iron, from half to four
grains (according to the size of the dog in both
instances), twice a day with food. Make a
lotion of liquor carbo. detergens 2 drachms,
liquor plumbi sub. acet. 2 drachms, and
water to 8 ounces, and apply to affected parts
several times a day, and prevent licking. Meat
may be given with other food in this case.
A bath every day or every other day made
as follows should give relief: Borax, two
tablespoonfuls; fine oatmeal, eight tablespoon-
fuls; tepid water, three gallons.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
IX.—The Bio Flood.
As with droughts, so with floods. They
are bad enough while they last, but when
they’re over they rapidly become ten
times worse. Floods occur in some dis-
tricts but not in others. If they don t
occur in your district it can't be helped.
It’s the same with measles, a good pedi-
gree or an aptitude for the saxophone.
Either you’ve got it or you haven t. A
propensity for flooding can't be acquired,
like an American accent or a taste for
oysters.
For a good flood a plentiful supply of
water is needed, and a large slice of land
to spread it on. Most of the land should
be under crop, and the rest should carry
sufficient sheep, cattle, horses, pigs,
children, adults, houses, motor-cars, rail-
ways, roads and bridges to make the
press reports and photographs interesting.
When a flood commences people get
hot and bothered. Then they get cold
and wet. As the water rises and they
see the neighbor’s piano floating off down-
stream they get into a better frame of
mind and begin to wonder whether the
water will reach the mark on the draw-
ing-room wall made by the Big Flood
in grandpa’s time.
It misses by eight inches, and they
become quite nasty and pass remarks
about grandpa’s well-known lack of
accuracy.
Every district
has had its big
flood, but the real
Big Flood was
big even for a big
flood.
The Murray
and Darling were
so wide that the
captains of the
river steamers
couldn’t hear the
dogs barking, and
so deep that they
couldn’t see the
tops of the gum-
trees. Conse-
quently many
vessels got hope-
lessly lost. When
the water receded
many of them
were found tied
up to pub veran-
dahs hundreds of
miles from the
river.
Some were
never seen again,
while one,, with a
deep-sea skipper,
plotted a Great
Circle course
from Bourke to
Murray Bridge,
used the wrong
logarithm and
was finally
wrecked in the
pack-ice near
Vladivostok.
The skipper said afterwards that he
felt a bit dubious passing Shanghai, but
the mate told him it was the far end of
Little Bourke-street. To his dying day
he always claimed that if it hadn’t been
for the ice he’d have got somewhere in
the end.
It was a great flood.

REVENGE.
I was yarning with Ted the petrol-
station proprietor when a big car bustled
in and the driver called for four gallons.
Ted moved over and suggested that as
the back tyres were worn he should fit
a special line of “Puncture Proofs.
“No, thanks; just petrol.”
“Well, I’ve got a great line for reviv-
ing bodywork; yours can do with it."
A bit impatiently this time: “No, four
gallons, please.” ...
“I suppose you’ll fill up with oil,’ said
Ted.
The car-driver, who appeared to be
in a hurry, splut-
tered with rage,
and repeated his
instructions, so Ted
pumped in the
petrol.
“W hat’s the
idea?” I asked
later. “You could
see he didn’t want
anything.”
“Getting a bit of
my own back,” re-
plied Ted. “He’s
my barber.”

HIS DOWNFALL.
A lurching, un-
kempt figure, he
was often seen reel-
ing from the local
hotel to his home.
The neighbors
told numerous
stories of how his
downfall came
about. Some said
he had been dis-
appointed in love
—that a coquette
had toyed with his
heart, then cast it
aside. Others said
he had been a business magnate, and had
been ruined by the crash of some big
speculation. Others again declared that
he had been a brilliant author, and the
refusal of the world to recognise his
genius had broken his heart.
They were all wrong. He was merely
spending his lottery prize.

THIS WEEK’S NATURE NOTE.
In North Queensland there is a queer
animal called the dingaboose. It lays
purple-and-yellow-striped eggs, laughs
loudly for no reason in particular, has
four legs, three wheels and a trailer, and
must not be delivered on a Sunday.
Its skin is much prized by the blacks,
who use it for cleaning their teeth and
for lining their sovereign-cases. The
young bear no resemblance at all to their
parents, and this often causes trouble in
the family. In consequence the animal
is fast dying out, which will be a bad
thing for science, but good luck for the
wongaloos on which it preys.
B.
NOT HIS FAULT.
“Poor old Tonkins has two wives to
support now,” remarked the cash-order
collector to Mrs. Brown the other morn-
ing-
“ Good heavens!” Mrs. Brown replied.
“You don’t mean to say he’s a
bigamist?”
“Oh, no. Nothing like that; but his
son got married last week.”

RISING TO GREAT HEIGHTS.
“There was considerable speculation as to
how Crawford would handle the 7ft. 7in.
American.” — "Telegraph.”
It seemed at first that Crawford would
require a gantry and block and tackle
to handle him at all. Yet this outsize in
humans bit the shaven sward because—
and not in spite —of his great height.
At the end of the first set the Brob-
dingnagian Yank was bleeding from the
ears and complained of giddiness; this
was due to going up for high smashes,
the rarefied stratosphere in which he
operated having a grave effect upon
him.
Then whilst executing his cannon-ball
service, delivering it from three inches
outside the base-line, he invariably trod
on the net when bringing his right foot
down. This necessitated his serving
afterwards from the front row of the gal-
lery, and it was a simple matter for the
Australian to put a drop shot just over
“ Who’s the nice lady that smiled at you, George?”
“That’s our new mistress, dad. Don’t you wish she was
yours, too?”
the net, approximately 65 yards from
where the American was serving.
It would have been thought that when
he got to the net the American, with a
reach of 14ft. both ways, would be im-
passable. Here again his dispropor-
tionate physique led to his downfall. The
ball, which to Crawford appeared quite
normal, seemed to his enormous oppo-
nent comparatively like a marble, and
therefore difficult to sight. It was no
wonder he was beaten from the word go.
The Yanks in future had better stick
to players about Perry’s size.

A SIMPLE DEDUCTION.
“It cannot have escaped your notice,
Holmes, that there have been many cases
of robbery with violence lately. Do
you agree with the ‘Blurb’ that these
outrages may be due to the influence of
cheap American sensational magazines,
or would you consider that the literary
output of the ‘Blurb’ itself may in some
way have contributed”
The great detective interrupted im-
patiently.
“My dear Watson, sometimes I despair
of you. You have been associated with
me for nearly 50 years. You know my
methods. And yet you put forward these
entirely futile suggestions. Surely even
you must have noticed that income-tax
returns are due this month? It is quite
obvious, Watson. These so-called robbers
are merely employees of the Taxation
Department waking from their winter
sleep and limbering up their muscles in
preparation for the mass attack. That is
all, Watson. Pass the cocaine.”

In bubbly wine I seek that cheer
Which limns the landscape double.

Information Sought.
During a rally in a tennis match the server
makes a cross-court return which carries the
ball well outside the sideline. The receiver’s
return, though it falls into the court, does not
cross the net, but is returned outside the post.
Is it a good return ? —2429.
Yes. Clause (c), rule 20, governs this. It
says: “If the ball be returned outside the post,
either above or below the level of the top of
the net, even though it touch the post, provided
that it hits the ground within the proper court,
it is a good return.”
Is it possible for me to marry immediately
after the arrival of my fiancee from England ?
If so, which church makes the least fuss ?
2357.
Your intended wife must establish residence
in N. S. Wales for a few days, and be of the
age of 21. You may be married by a district
registrar or by any priest or minister author-
ised to celebrate marriages. In either case
you should give at least three days’ notice of
your intention. The least “fuss” would be
before a registrar.
I wish to erect a reinforced-concrele house.
Is it practical to put a damp-course in the
walls at floor level and carry the reinforcing-
rods from the foundation up through the walls

(1) What is the process of desiccation? (2)
Have any organisms the power to survive desic-
cation ? —2400.
(1) It consists of removing moisture, and
may be done by heating the substance or by
agents such as calcium chloride, sulphuric acid
and potassium hydrate. Vacuum desiccation
is a quicker process, and is caused by exhaust-
ing the air from the desiccators. Currents of
dry air are also used. (2) Hematodes, or
‘ paste-eels” have been known to revive after
being desiccated for nearly 20 years. Rotifers
are said to recover after a long period of
desiccation, and so are bear-animalcules, or
tardigrades. Seeds and spores of plants seem
able to resist any period of desiccation.

What dress would a captain of the sth
Royal Fusiliers wear on formal evening occa-
sions in 1830 ? —2219.
Full-dress uniform, consisting of a double-
breasted red coat cut square across the bottom
of the waist in front, and with long tails
behind, with two rows of buttons down the
front. The coat would be white-lined and but-
toned back at the tail ends, with blue facings
on _ cuffs and cellars and gold epaulettes. A
white cross belt passed over the right shoulder
to the left hip. A red sash passed round the
waist. Long tight black trousers with a wide
gold stripe down the leg, finished off with
spurs and a sword. The hat was a grenadier’s
cap made of racoon skin with a distinctive
badge of a red-and-white hackle feather on
the left side. Any contemporary picture show-
ing the ball on the eve of the Battle of
Waterloo will give an idea of how the costume
should be worn.
Details concerning the kangaroo-apple ?
2438.
This fruit, Solanum aviculare, the “gunyang”
of the Victorian abo., ranges almost across the
continent. The apples, when perfectly ripe,
burst their outer skins and may be eaten
raw, boiled or baked. They have a mealy,
sub-acid taste when cooked; if eaten unripe,
they have an acrid taste and cause a burning
in the throat.
Biographical details concerning Charles
Throsby, the explorer, who found the Murrtim-
bidgee River (N.S.W .) in 1821 ? —2404.
Bom at Leicester (England) in 1771, he
reached N.S.W. in 1802 as surgeon of the
convict-transport Coromandel. Following ser-
vice as acting-surgeon and magistrate at Castle
Hill and Newcastle, also commandant at the
latter place, he became agent for Sir John
Jamison. In 1813 he was granted 500 acres
at Cabramatta for his services at Newcastle.
In 1819 Throsby’s successful explorations won
Macquarie’s heart, and he was given 1000 acres
at Bong Bong as a reward for his “zeal and
perseverance.” In 1825 he was appointed to
the Legislative Council. In 1817 Garnham
Blaxcell, a friend for whom he had pledged
himself in the sum of £5OOO, absconded to
England and died on the way there; the
creditors sued Throsby, and in 1827 the case
was decided against him. Worn out with ill-
health and anxiety, he shot himself at Glen-
field on April 2, 1828.
Can you tell me something about the West
Australian Governor after wham Broome was
named? —2418. ’
He was Sir Frederick Napier Broome, son
of a missionary, and born in Canada in 1842.
He was in turn a sheep-farmer in M.L., a
journalist in London and an official in Natal
and Mauritius. In 1882 he was appointed
Governor of Western Australia, then still a
Crown colony. His governorship was marked
by a rapid extension of railways and other
means of communication, and by an agitation
for self-government which he heartily sup-
ported. When in 1890 W.A. obtained a Con-
stitution, Sir Frederick was transferred to Bar-
bados as Acting-Governor, becoming in 1891
Governor of Trinidad. He died in London in
1896.
What were the circumstances of the expul-
sion in the ’eighties of Dr. Chas. Strong, of
Scots Church, Melbourne ? —2394.
In 1881 Dr. Strong was asked to explain
certain statements which he had made in .an
article on the Atonement in the “Victorian
Review.” At first he refused to reply; even-
tually he agreed to a resolution which urged'
him to make prominent in his preaching cer-
tain fundamental Christian truths. On August
1, 1883, he invited to his pulpit in the Scots
Church a Unitarian layman, who lectured on
religion and science and spoke against the
divinity of Christ without protest from Dr.
Strong. After various moves the General
Assembly declared Dr. Strong no longer a
minister bf the Church.
What connection did John Taw ell, who mur-
dered Sarah Hart and was executed in London
in 1845, have with Australia? —2388.
He was transported in 1814, escaping execu-
tion because the bank officials, being Quakers,
as was Tawell, and opposed to capital punish-
ment, prosecuted him on the minor charge of
having a forged bill in his possession. Arriving
in Sydney, Tawell got employment as a chemist,
his profession, in the convict hospital, and soon
gained his freedom. He started as a chemist
and druggist (with groceries as a sideline), in
Hunter-street, moved to larger premises ■in
Pitt-street, bought a whaling-ship, cornered the
whalebone market, speculated in oil and be-
came wealthy. He built a chapel for the
Society of Friends in Macquarie-street, and on
March 5, 1836, had 492 gallons-of rum and
116 gallons of Geneva gin, his own property,
poured into the harbor. About 1840 he re-
turned to England, where he committed the
crime for which he was executed.
What is the difference between “verse” and
“poetry" ? —2426.
Verse is a generic term descriptive of the
literary form of balanced lines to a rhythm,
rhymed or unrhymed. Poetry properly means
expression in the verse-form which is inspired
by the creative poetic gift. Keats’s “Ode to a
Nightingale” is poetry, and the Ingoldsby
Legends are verse.
Who is Figaro in fiction? —2403.
A famous character of dramatic fiction, who
made his first appearance in the “Barbier de
Seville” (1785) and the “Mariage de Figaro”
of Beaumarchais. “Figaro” in old-fashioned
Spanish and Italian meant wigmaker. Beau-
marchais’s Figaro figures in Mozart’s “Marriage
of Figaro,” Rossini’s “Barber of Seville” and
15 less-successful operas on the same theme.
Where and how did eisteddfods originate ?
—2396.
They were instituted in Wales to encourage
the composition and preservation of national
poetry and music. Date of origin is not certain,
but an eisteddfod was held at Caerwys, in Flint-
shire, about the beginning of the twelfth cen-
tury. There are records of eisteddfods having
been held in the reigns of Edward 111., Henry
VI., Henry VIII. and Elizabeth. The festival
then seems to have been discontinued, but it
was revived in 1789.
Who were the elemental spirits or angels
of the elements? —2413.
They were pantheistic conceptions. The
spirits of fire were the salamanders; of water,
the undines; of air, sylphs; and of earth,
gnomes. They were supposed to dwell in
their respective elements. Paracelsus wrote a
treatise on them.
(1) What is the procedure necessary to copy-
right a musical play in (a) the Commonwealth,
(b) all countries ? (2) What is the approximate
cost of copyrighting such a play in (a) the
Commonwealth, (b) all countries ? —2276.
Registration of copyright in a musical play
in the Commonwealth would automatically
extend throughout the British Empire. Forms
of application for registration are obtainable
from the Copyright Office, Canberra. Appli-
cation must be accompanied by a copy of the
work and a fee of ss. The copy of the work
will be retained at the Copyright Office, Can-
berra. For forms of application for registra-
tion and information as to fees payable in
foreign countries, write to the copyright office
in each country, or employ a patent attorney.

or pictures which cannot be screened and
seen before hiring. (2) A contract for a group
of pictures offered as a whole. (3) Process of
synchronising a language other than that used

(2) Members, £255 35.; Speaker, £583 45.;
Chairman of Committees, £364| 10s. p.a., plus
travelling expenses at the opening and closing
of each session. (3) In 1920 the salary of
members of the House of Reps, was £5OO p.a.;
successive reductions of 10 p.c. were made in.
1922, 1931 and 1932. Legislative Councillors
received £350 p.a. in 1920, and this amount
has been subject to the same 10 p.c. reduc-
tions. (4) £364 10s. p.a., plus travelling ex-
penses at the. opening and closing of each
session. Speaker receives £7OB 15s. p.a., plus
sessional allowance of £7B 15s. and free
quarters. Chairman of Committees receives
£546 15s. p.a.
(1). Are books published in Great Britain
subject to censorship ? (2) Who is the censor?
(3) Are books from Europe and overseas cen-
sored by Australian Customs Dept. ? (4) Type
of books or names of books banned in British
Empire ? —2286.
(1) and (2)’ They are subject' to the “sub-
terranean censorship” of the Circulating
Libraries’ Assoc., composed of representatives
of the leading London circulating libraries, who,
it is understood, make publishers submit all
books for censorship one week before publi-
cation, after • which they are classed as satis-
factory, doubtful or objectionable. Any book
deemed objectionable may be confiscated and
the author haled before the Court. There is
no official censor to direct supervision before
publication. (3) and (4) The Customs Dept,
is guided, as in Australia, Ireland and Canada,
by 'a permanent blacklist of prohibited books
and magazines of an obscene or revolutionary
nature. Canada’s list would seem to be longer
than Great Britain’s, for it includes, together
with Joyce’s “Ulysses” and Burton’s transla-
tion of “The Arabian Nights,” almost all of
Maupassant and several of the novels of Comp-
ton Mackenzie, W. L. George and Hall Caine,
whose work circulates freely in Great Britain,
but not in the Irish Free State.
Simple method of determining the polarity
of a 32-volt D.C. generator ? —2OBO.
Connect two lengths of wire to the generator
terminals and bare the free ends for a dis-
tance of 2in. Place these in a glass of water
in which a teaspoonful of salt has been dis-
solved, care being taken to keep the wires at
least an inch apart. When the machine is
started, gas bubbles will be liberated from the
negative wire in greater quantities than from
the positive wire.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
Major Dickie, D.C.M., Croix de
Guerre, Legion d’Honneur Ferdinand,
who has died in Brisbane, served
throughout the S. African War with a
Scottish regiment. In 1914, being in
Canada, he enlisted in the C.E.F., and
was in or near the line till the Armistice.
After that he fought for nearly a year
against the Riffs. Has anyone living got
a more diversified fighting record?

“Ibn el Issar”: The fact that caste
Hindus in southern India have forbidden
the casteless untouchables to bathe in the
village tanks, though cattle are allowed
access to them, has been quoted as a new
example of the extreme fanaticism en-
gendered by the controversy started by
Gandhi. The point is missed altogether.
In the Hindu scheme of things the cow
and her relatives rank only a little lower
than a Brahmin; it would be almost
equally dangerous to kill either in a
Hindu community.
# * * *
“Sahiblonga”: It is doubtful if many
of “lbn el lssar’s” Hindus who “go back
to the old gods” (B. 27/6/’34) have
ever really deserted them. My own ex-
perience is that most “conversions” to
the religion of the Sahib-log are due to
a desire to ape the white man. This
trait, together with the hope of bak-
sheesh, regularly drew my servants to
the garrison church every Sunday. On
other days, however, and especially on
the occasion of those Hindu —and
Moslem—religious festivals known col-
lectively as “ramsamis,” none were
more addicted to bhang and arrack, and
none salaamed to stock idols and local
deities with more fervor, than my boys
Sunka the bowarchi, Ali the punkah-
wallah, Quari the pani-wallah and Narji
the khansamah.

“Aged”: Touching the theft of the
“Mona Lisa,” I visited the Louvre and
found that masterpiece in a smallish
room, flanked by two insignificant pic-
tures. Inquiry elicited the information
that these small pictures were the seat of
“invisible ray” emanations ; let one only
lean too far over the rail, and bells
would ring, doors close and lock,
and Mona would retreat into a cavity
concealed by a secret panel in the ceiling.
At least that was the impression our in-
formant gave, but then he was French.
That the little pictures were some kind
of protection to the masterpiece is pro-
bable enough, but I suspect that they
merely concealed an observation post.

“Lord Luvus”: Reno, America’s (and
t h e world’s) principal divorce mill, is fecl-
j th e s j um p The average number of
customers is now a mere 2500 p.a„
whereas in a really good pre-depression
y ear 4250 parties were wont to wash
their domestic linen in public. Neverthe-
less, Reno citizens are relieved of taxa-
tion to the extent of three to four mil-
lion dollars annually, that being the
amount paid in fees by litigants. The
place was originally a gold- and silver-
mining centre, but in 1910 silver slumped
so badbf that mtning became unprofit-
able. The lawyers felt the pinch more
t^an an y onCj an d it was they who con-
C eived the neat idea of making Reno a
place where divorces could be obtained
under the easiest conditions. During the
nex t year 100 couples paid 145,000 dollars
j 0 b e relieved of conjugal shackles. The
parsons promptly protested, and the legis-
lators made a year’s residence obligatory,
b u t } n 1915 jt W as reduced to six months,
an( j j n 1927 to three months. In 1931
R eno faced fierce competition from Idaho

ducing the term to six weeks. It will be
difficult for any other State to provide
better facilities than Nevada ; except in
contested cases, grounds for divorce can
be so vague as to be practically non-
existent.

TESTING THE HEAVY DIVISION.
ROAD PERFORMANCE OF THE TWO-TON L.W.B. MORRIS.
By FRED BERRY.
in spite of the efforts made by various State Governments
to restrict motor transport, it has been proved that the march
of progress cannot be stopped, and now the truck and ’bus are
again playing their part.
Commercial vehicles are of national importance. “The
Bulletin’’ has undertaken to carefully test and record the
performances of such vehicles.
The test is of a most comprehensive nature, covering every
feature of value in heavy vehicles, and the capabilities of
the C-type two-ton long-wheelbase Morris were thoroughly
explored.
The truck selected had been in daily Over the measured half-mile a test of
use by Cylinder Carriers, Ltd., of Bal- maximum speed was made and found to
main, for eight months, and the speed- be 44 m.p.h., road-holding and steering
ometer reading stood at 5130 miles. No qualities being very good in spite of the
Stripped chassis of two-ton L.W.B. Morris, showing sturdy construction and
provision for forward control.
preliminary adjustments were made, and
tests were carried out with a pay-load of
3f tons and gross weight of 5 tons 17cwt.
—a 75 p.c. overload.
On a steep hill with an average grade
of 1 in 6 the Morris made a steady climb,
beginning at 10 m.p.h. in 30sec., second
and bottom gears being used.
Facing' downhill, brakes were tested
on the steepest portion from a speed of
10 m.p.h. With the service footbrakes
the machine stopped in eight feet —an
excellent performance—while with the
emergency handbrake (obviously in need
of adjustment) the distance required was
twenty feet.
Returning up the grade, stopping and
restarting tests were made, and, although

grossly overladen, the Morris made a
good getaway, proving good transmission
efficiency.
Setting out then through busy city
traffic along the main western road, the
heavy truck handled well and the speed-
ometer was kept around the 30-mark, all
reasonable grades being negotiated on
top gear.
heavy overload; the lorry showed no
inclination to sway or “wander.”
Immediately before reaching Liverpool
advantage was taken of several unmade
side tracks in order to test manoeuvring
and reversing. The results were entirely
satisfactory, changing of steering lock
from full right to full left involving little
more physical effort than in a touring-car.
Next tests were in clocking accelera-
tion in top and third gears from 10 to
25 m.p.h., the times being 34sec. and
18sec. respectively, figures which should
be considerably improved upon with a
normal load of two tons.
Efficiency of the hydraulic braking sys-
tem was then checked, the distance taken
to pull up from a speed of 20 m.p.h.
being 30ft. —a very
good result.
Turning circle
was measured and
found to be 55
feet on both right
and left locks.
For the 36-mile
run the time taken,
inclusive of all
tests, was 1£ hours,
showing an aver-
age road speed of
24 m.p.h. The
fuel used, 3 gallons,
gave a consumption
of 12 m.p.g., which,
when calculated
against the gross
loading of 5 tons
17cwt., gave the
economical figures
of 70.2 ton-miles per gallon.
The long-wheelbase C-type Morris
is of robust construction, and should
stand up to hard usage for long periods
without unduly heavy maintenance
charges.
Chassis is built on the X principle,
ensuring maximum rigidity. Provision of
forward control permits attachment of a
body of same length as wheelbase with-
out overhang. Six-cylinder power unit
with bore 82mm. and stroke 110 mm. is
rated at 25.01 h.p., cubic capacity being
3485c.c. Maximum output at full revs,
is 55 b.h.p.
Engine is mounted at three points on
rubber supports, and consequently can
be run continuously at high speeds with-
out undue vibration. Detachable cylinder-
heads are used, and the cylinders are cast
en bloc, being integral with the upper
half of the crankcase. Capacity of cool-
ing system is 5 l-3gal., with detachable
manifold on off side of block in order to
equalise flow of water over combustion
chamber and valves.
A four-bearing crankshaft, statically
and dynamically balanced, is fitted, main
bearings being of white metal with de-
tachable shells. Ignition is by coil and
battery system, with plugs located cen-
trally in cylinder-heads.
Pistons are light-construction four-
ring type, and gudgeon pins of large
diameter are clamped into connecting-
rod small ends.
Fuel is drawn from a 15gal. tank at
rear of chassis to an Autovac unit located
on the off side of the dash, thence to an
efficient carburettor of special design, in-
corporating a detachable filter element.
Engine lubrication is provided by a
submerged gear-type pump driven from
camshaft. Oil is drawn through a
detachable perforated plate strainer, and
afterwards forced through a renewable
cartridge-type pressure filter of generous
dimensions to a main oil duct running
along the near side of motor. Lines are
taken from this duct to camshaft, crank-
shaft and big-end bearings, and to timing
case and chain-drive.
Short shafts, large bearings and silent
third constant-mesh pinions in Morris
gearbox.
Cylinder walls, gudgeon pins and tap-
pets are lubricated by splash from the
big ends.
Capacity of sump is two gallons.
Chassis lubrication is designed on the
group plan, every point being easily
accessible.
Transmission is through Min. single-
plate Borg and Beck clutch of “fixed”
type, requiring no adjustment in service,
to a four-speed-and-reverse gearbox
built on the unit principle with engine
and clutch.
Gearbox casting is cast iron, carrying
short stiff shafts on ball bearings. Third
gear is of “silent” type, using constant-
mesh double helical gears with dog en-
gagement.
Change-speed lever is mounted cen-
trally with spring loaded reverse stop.
An open propeller shaft is coupled to
a fabric universal joint behind the gear-
box, and a metal universal joint in a
self-aligning central bearing is carried in
a substantial housing.
Drive from centre transmission bear-
ing to rear axle is by a shaft sliding in
universal joint splines and enclosed in
a telescopic tube assembly.
Final drive is spiral bevel type, with
alloy steel full floating line axles.
Hubs run on taper roller bearings,
permitting axles to be withdrawn with-
out disturbing hub mountings.
Four-wheel braking equipment is of
the Lockheed hydraulic type, ensuring
equal application of power simul-
taneously on all wheels. Handbrake
operates shoes on rear wheels only.
Steering is by worm and segment, the
worm being mounted on taper roller
bearings.
Suspension is of special design, with
auxiliary spring leaves coming into action
progressively with varying loads.
Graphite Lubrication.
Since the inception of motoring cycles
of favoritism for some particular lubri-
cating compound have come and gone,
and few have survived the faddist stage.
Among the favorites was graphite. As
a lubricant it has always had much to
recommend it, but until lately its use
anywhere but in cold-type bearings
usually led to mischief.
Now that graphite has been commer-
cially produced in a colloidal state the
disabilities accompanying its use have
been removed.
In the early days graphite in flake
form, while useful as an addition to

fied, showing “hills”
and “hollows.”
grease for shackle and spring lubrica-
tion, blocked up oilways and caused no
end of trouble when it got into the sump
with engine oil.
Using true colloidal graphite, how-
ever, there can be no worries on this
score, for the particles are so finely
divided that they will pass through the
finest gauzes or filters.
When added to lubricating oil in small
quantities it is of untold value, particu-
larly during the running-in of a new
engine. The fine particles of graphite
suspended in the oil become embedded
in the metal surfaces and prove of great
assistance to the lubricating qualities of
any oil that may be used.
The average motorist cannot realise
that the apparently shiny surface of the

cylinder bore is not smooth —from a
scientific viewpoint—but is actually a
series of hills and hollows.
Microscopic examination reveals this
rough condition. As shown in the
accompanying illustrations, colloidal
graphite slowly fills these inequalities,
and after a little time gives as near to a
perfect bearing surface as it is possible
to obtain.

CHRONIC BACKACHE

A
WEAK KIDNEYS
are the real cause of your trouble!
There is an epidemic of premature “oldness.” Men and
women Vrho should be in the prime of life, vigorous and vitally
fit, find their capacity for work and pleasure destroyed by
constant down-dragging pain.
Awful backache, sharp, agonising pains shooting through
the body, stiff, swollen joints, blood impurities, headaches, bad
nights or bladder troubles then follow.
The kidneys lie at the root of your trouble, for if they are not filtering and
purifying the blood as it passes through the system, they are allowing impurities and
poisons, such as uric acid, to accumulate. Nerves become inflamed, muscles ache
with pain. Neglect your warning and you are heading for breakdown.
There is only one thing to do and that is to prompt the kidneys
to clear out from the body the pain-giving impurities. Keep the
kidneys active and healthy and your pain and suf-
fering will disappear. For this purpose we do most
strongly recommend a short course with De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills.
THIS FAMOUS REMEDY FOR OVER 40 YEARS
HAS BEEH TRUSTED BY THE PUBLIC
The very young, the weakest and the oldest can
take De Witt’s Pills with confidence. They contain
no dangerous drugs, but are a scientific preparation
that will do you good from the very first dose.
Every box sold bears the prescription from which
they are made.

Motor Oddities.
Fads in Registration Numbers.
“Spark”: There are probably more
than 480,000 motor-cars and over
72,000 commercial motor vehicles in
Australia to-day, and all are fitted with
number-plates. It may be irrational, but
a great deal of interest is taken in the
numbers by many people outside the
police and the license authorities. A
sight that never fails to attract some
attention in Melbourne is the appearance
in the streets of a big blue car which
MOTORIMPRESSIONS.
That four-wheel-brakes sensation.
prominently features the numerals
123-456. Applications for particular
numbers are regularly made to the motor-
registration department, and the fancies
submitted must sometimes evoke a
puzzled “Why?”
You’d imagine that number 13 would
be shunned by motorists. As a matter of
fact, it is always in demand. During late
years several owners have tried to obtain
il, but the supposedly evil figure is ear-
marked, and it has adorned a succession
of cars owned by a Melbourne man, who
transfers it whenever he purchases a
newer model. A N.S.W. man who owns
a small fleet of cars dotes on sevens, and
he has put himself to quite a deal of
trouble in satisfying his fancy. Although
he has tried for some time to secure
77-777, success has not yet crowned his
efforts. The present holder, it seems,
reveres “five of a kind.”
Small numbers are eagerly sought
after; numbers 1,2, 3, 4 and 5, though
rarely seen, are in use. Three and 5
adorn two Melbourne Rolls-Royces. No.
20-549 was awarded to what is claimed
to be the first all-Australian car pro-
duced in Vic.
A taste for poker has, it would appear,
influenced the fancy for plates of the
“straight,” “full-hand” and “flush”
order. Certain firms which employ fleets
of cars and trucks are also interested in
the matter of number-plates “for trade
purposes.” The agents for the sprightly
gentleman born in 1820, for instance,
naturally have a fancy for those
numerals, though they don’t often get
them. More fortunate are the repre-
sentatives of a perfume-manufacturing
house whose trade-mark is a number.
Some folk go in for
fancy number-plates. The
gayest are to be seen in
Queensland, where some-
times one may see mother-
of-pearl plates, with the “Q”
done in tortoise-shell. But
that’s another story.
Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom
centre in technical or abstract features, but rather in personal
experiences or achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over
specified routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the
present mechanical condition of cars after years of use are matters
of extreme interest. Huge annual mileages, old driving licenses, and
perhaps low car numbers support claims to experience, while many
drivers, with characteristic Australian ingenuity, have made interest-
ing emergency repairs.
Who holds No. 1 license or drives No. 1 car in each State, and
who drove the first car?
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver
covers the greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been
confined to racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic,
hundreds of miles from repair shops, has worked miracles in order
to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin" and recount
their experiences.
Dye Antidote for Exhaust Fumes.
Every driver should be aware of the
risks incurred in running a car for any
time in a closed garage. Carbon-mon-
oxide gas, emitted from the exhaust, is
a deadly poison, and the victim seldom
recovers from a thorough “gassing.”
There have been a couple of cases in
Australia lately.
Now the National Safety Council of
America, as a result of experiment, has
announced that carbon-monoxide poison-
ing need not necessarily be accompanied
by fatal results. Fifty cubic centimetres
of a one per cent, solution of methylene
blue injected into the veins of the patient
is declared to be a cure.
Record speed for motor-cycles, now
standing to the credit of Ernst Henne
(Germany), on a 750-c.c. Dunlop-shod
8.W.M., is not likely to endure for long
if British manufacturers have their way.
So anxious are they to regain lost laurels

“THE WIDE-WORLD FOUR” RECEIVER.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Witli tuned R.F. stage, electron-coupled detector and “Class-B” audio
system, this four-valve battery All-wave Receiver is easily the best performer
of its type yet designed by the writer. Sensitive and powerful, but very
economical, it is recommended to battery users seeking the utmost obtainable
from a minimum number of valves.
A recent improvement in receiver de-
sign uses a regenerative detector in “elec-
tron-coupled” form. This feature was
applied very successfully in a simple two-
valve receiver of the plug-in coil short-
wave type, the “Wide-World Two,”
which showed obvious advantages over
the conventional triode or screen-grid
“feed-back” detector.
It is just as important as in the case
of a transmitter for high frequencies (or
low freauencies) that a receiver, particu-

former and “Class-B” valve behind the rear partition.
larly where regeneration in the detector
contributes materially to signal amplifi-
cation, should be thoroughly stable in
operation. No matter how well the re-
ceiver may be constructed mechanically,
it will fail to do its job properly if the
detector valve sutlers from “wobbula-
tion.”
The valves chosen for the “Wide-World
Two” were of the “Automotive” kind,
designed with six-volt heaters for use in
motor-car radio receivers. The ’77 R.F.
pentode valve was used as electron-
coupled detector and an impedance-
coupled ’37 triode as the audio stage,
intended for use with headphones. It
was found that, owing to the high audio
amplification from the pentode output
of the ’77, it was possible to use the re-
ceiver with a loudspeaker, but distinct
improvement was effected by substituting
a ’3B pentode power valve for the ’37.
This receiver, by reason of the two in-
directly-heated valves, could be used
either with direct or alternating current
on the heaters, and B batteries or filtered
power supply on the plates. Thus, the
receiver was a truly “universal” type.
Provision of R.F. amplification or addi-
tional audio amplification in the “Wide-
World Two” would have considerably
reduced the economical application for
battery use, but by substituting the 2.5-
volt A.C. valve equivalents and using a
power-pack a powerful and stable form
of A.C. regenerative short-wave receiver
could be evolved.
With the requirements of battery con-
sumption the primary consideration the
“Wide-World Three” was next designed
(B. 20/6/’34), and in this strictly battery
type directly-heated valves were em-
ployed, still with an electron-coupled de-
tector. The “Wide-World Three” in-
cluded “Class-B” audio amplification and
wave-change switching, and covered the
international short-wave channels and the
200- to 550-metre broadcast band. As
this receiver stands, it would be quite
feasible to add tuned R.F. amplification,
but complication would arise unless a
separate wave-change switch was used
and the R.F. circuit carefully screened
from the detector to prevent interlocking.
It was decided to improve upon the
“Wide-World Three” by designing an-
other receiver using tuned R.F., electron-
coupled detector and “Class-B” audio,
but to simplify constructional matters by
using the ever convenient and depend-
able plug-in coil method of changing
wavebands. Instead of applying the
directly-heated screen-grid detector with
filament above earth potential (apt to
be confusing to the constructor) a special
two-volt indirectly heated valve, the type
15, was tried with excellent results.
Thus the new receiver, described here
as the “Wide-World Four,” emerged
from The Bulletin laboratory, its effi-
ciency as a battery-operated all-wave
receiver of this type thoroughly estab-
lished.
The Type 15 Valve.
For some lime rumors were current in
the Australian radio trade that a new
series of indirectly-heated two-volt
battery valves was to issue from Ameri-
can laboratories. The advantages of such
valves are freedom from microphonics
and cathode biasing. The only valve of
this type to put in an appearance has
been the 15, available in Ken-Rad and
Sylvania makes. It is a screen-grid valve
with the following characteristics:
R.F. pentode, indirectly heated.
Heater voltage, 2 volts.
Heater current, .2 ampere.
Plate voltage, 135 volts.
Screen voltage, 67.5 volts.
Grid bias, 1.5 volts negative.
Plate current, 1.85 milliamperes.
Screen current, .6 milliampere.
The socket connections are the standard
American five-pin with the connections
corresponding to the 24A, 35 or 36. The
suppressor grid is connected internally
to the cathode.
Circuit Description.
Reference to the circuit diagram will
show that the receiver is of the straight-
forward type, minus all frills, but with
the advantages of the electron-coupled
detector, impedance audio coupling, and
“Class-B” audio output. Two-volt valves
are used, the tuned R.F. stage being a
’32, 15 E.-C. detector, ’3O driver and 19
“Class-B” twin valve. The tuned R.F.
stage is separately tuned, and for a re-
ceiver of this kind this is a distinct ad-
vantage. It would be possible in a care-
fully built laboratory model to gang the
R.F. and detector stages, but this in-
volves cut-and-try methods for the con-
structor and would probably be dis-
appointing. The R.F. valve is shunt-
fed and capacity-coupled to the detector-
grid circuit. The coupling capacity must
be very small; no larger than 20 mmfd.
The Wetless Company (N.S.W.) makes
such small capacities. Alternatively, one
of the now ancient two-plate neutralising
condensers makes an ideal coupling,
being adjustable.
A too-large capacity here would result
in certain interlocking of the R.F. and
detector, with consequent “pulling” of
the tuning. The same kind of coil
arrangement as for the “Wide-World
Two” is used for the detector, with
separate cathode coil, and for each band
the R.F. grid coil corresponds to the de-
tector-grid coil in size and number of
turns. The connections to the four-pin
valve socket for the detector coil are
illustrated; these connections are stan-
dardised by the writer for all similar
plug-in coil applications. The audio
coupling between detector and driver
valves is a high impedance choke ; this,
not resistance coupling, is essential for
best results. With the difference that a
250,000 potentiometer is included in the
driver grid circuit, the “Class-B” audio
is the same as for the “Wide-World
Three,” and if desired the Mullard
PM2DX and PM2B may be used. The
results are identical with both valve
combinations.
The 100,000-ohm potentiometer in the
R.F. stage screen-grid requires explana-
tion. Apart from providing correct
screen-grid voltage, this is extremely use-
ful when the receiver is used on the
200- to 550-metre range. A high screen-
grid voltage on the R.F. valve will check
any tendency to oscillation, and it is an
easy matter to control voltage finely by
the • potentiometer, rather than by big
jumps in battery tapping. The poten-
tiometer used in the screen-grid of the
15 detector is important. This is a
Centralab 250,000-ohm type, strongly
recommended for smoothly gradual and
silent control of regeneration.
Constructional Points.
The illustration of the complete re-
ceiver shows that you must have some-
thing more than a plain chassis. As with
the first T.R.F. short-wave receiver intro-
duced in Australia by the writer in June,
1928 (the “All-Empire”), attention is paid
to screening correctly the two tuned
circuits.
The structure is of aluminium, with
a front panel to minimise any possibility
of hand-capacity in tuning, and vertical-
screening partitions are used between the
R.F. and detector, and also between these
two and the audio portion. The chassis
measures 11 by 10 by 21 in. ; the front
panel 12 by 8 in. ; the interstage-screen-
ing partition 7 by 51 in., and the rear
partition 11 by 51 in. Both the parti-
lions have a half-inch angle-piece at the
longer dimension, for bolting vertically
to the chassis.
In the receiver, as illustrated, the tuning
condensers call for comment. The writer
employed two of the once-very-popular
Gecophone condensers cut down to four
rotor and three stator plates. These con-
densers were made with a self-contained
vernier motion, which explains the
appearance of the dials. They are no
longer obtainable in Australia, but
Murdochs (Sydney), who supply the
necessary parts to build this receiver,
have made available special Jackson
short-wave condensers. Used with
Utility micro dials or Lissen dials, these
Jackson condensers are particularly effi-
cient, as the rotor is insulated from the
condenser frame, and may be earthed
directly. This eliminates condenser
noises, and the feature is a good one.
The knob underneath the two tuning
dials is the Centralab .25 meg. regenera-
tion potentiometer, and the knob to the
right the .25 meg. Bradleyometer for
volume control. On the left is the bat-
tery switch, connected in the A plus cir-
cuit. The two insulated terminals visible
on the right of the chassis are for head-
phones,' connection being made simply
across the outsides of the “Class-B”
audio-driver transformer secondary. If
desired, the “Class-B” valve may be re-
moved from the socket for headphone
reception.
Normally, this receiver delivers a
powerful signal on even the weakest of
signals via the permagnetic speaker, so
that headphones are not necessary. It
is often, however, an advantage to in-
dulge in quiet reception thus, where non-
disturbance of the household by loud-
speaker signals is preferred.
Provision is made for a gramo.-pickup
by the terminals between detector grid
and earth, the terminals being mounted
at the rear of the chassis with the speaker
plug and battery-cable plug. For pick-
up work, the detector-grid coil (any one)

The spacing in each case between the
grid and cathode coils is and, after
winding, the coils are “doped”
lightly with clear Duco to hold the
turns in position and ensure per-
manent calibration. The two four-
pin sockets used for the coil
mountings are fitted on distance-
pieces H-in. above the top of the chassis.
Plug-in coil sockets for a short-wave re-
ceiver should never be mounted flush
with the metal top of a chassis. In the
illustration of the receiver the .0001 mfd.
mica grid condenser and leak may just
be seen behind the detector coil, fitted
on a strip of bakelite held by a bolt to
the side of the metal screen. This keeps
the lead to the control grid of the 15 very
short. Wiring for the tuned circuits is
done by using 16 tinned copper wire and
insulating sleeving, with all other wiring
in the usual push-back wiring flex. The
stiff wire in the tuned circuits helps to
maintain frequency stability, and too
much stress cannot be laid upon the

135 or 180 volts of B battery may be
used with the receiver, and the lower
voltage is ample for ordinary work. As
much as nine volts negative bias may
be used on the driver valve if extreme
economy is desired, but there is a ten-
dency to slight distortion at this voltage,
and reduction to six volts may be pre-
ferable. If oscillation does not take
place smoothly in the detector over the
whole tuning range for each band, a
little juggling with the position of the
cathode coil in relation to the grid coil
will overcome the difficulty. The “Wide-
World Four” is an extremely sensitive
receiver and may be used successfully
with quite a short indoor aerial, but for
use in the country the full advantage of
a good external aerial may be utilised,
for the broadcast band particularly.
Since completion, the original receiver
has been used in a country location, 350
miles from the city of Sydney, and an
extract from the user’s report says: “It
does everything! FYA and GSB are
received at full speaker volume, and the
broadcast band is very good ; many of
the stronger stations can be played dur-
ing the daytime.”
DON B. KNOCK.
The “talent” of a 20-year-old clerk in
England who “secretly worked a wire-
less transmitting set for 12 months” was
effusively praised by magistrates and
solicitors. No talent is called for in put-
ting together a contraption to spread
radio impulses in surrounding receivers.
Textbooks exist by the thousand, and in
1934 any schoolboy can follow diagrams.
To excuse piracy on grounds of “talent”
is grossly unfair to licensed radio experi-
menters.

noticed that only a small minority was
properly equipped to give customers
technical service. Apart from the lack of
“pocket” analysers, one outstanding de-
ficiency was a ready means of testing
valves in a reliable manner. The price
of modern valve-testers was considered
prohibitive. The writer has had for
examination and test the latest model
Slade-Paton valve-tester, and after a few
days’ use considers that at £9 7s. 6d. this
is something which dealers, both country
and city, cannot afford to be without.
The model illustrated operates from
the 240-volt A.C. line and is accompanied
by a carefully tabulated reference chart.
It gives a test at a glance of every type
of valve in everyday use, whether
directly (battery) or indirectly heated.
The mutual conductance of the valve
under examination is indicated on the
meter by a push-button switch, the test
being a dynamic one, under load. The
meter scale bears colored indicating sec-
tions, which show at once whether the
valve is bad, poor or good. Thus the
customer may see for himself the con-
dition of his valves without any doubt,
as may be the case where a tester bears
indication in degrees alone, calling for
a technical explanation. Dial lamp bulbs
/may also be checked with this tester. The
accompanying instructions for operation
are so clear that the most non-technical
user cannot fail to understand quickly
the modus operandi. The valve sockets
are marked alphabetically from A to O,
these including all the American types
and a combination English direct-indirect
heating socket. Among the collection
of valves in The Bulletin laboratory,
not a single valve (excluding the old
double-end types) was found which could
not be visually examined in a matter of
seconds by this inexpensive instrument.

parts you use are usable. Such things as grid
leaks, fixed condensers, or audio transformers
of doubtful origin may result in nothing but a
headache. This is a Reinartz three circuit, with
first audio resistance coupled, and the second
transformer coupled. The usual short-wave
plug-in coil system will do, but increase the
reaction coil two or three turns for this method
of oscillation control. The .001 mfd. fixed
condenser in series with the reaction coil is a
safeguard against touching plates in the variable
condenser, thus protecting the B battery.

BRIDGE
WITHOUT
SIGHS.
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
N.S.W. DUPLICATE PAIRS.
Sixteen selected pairs assembled at the
David Jones Auditorium on Friday
night, July 6. Eight pairs had been
chosen by the Bridge Association ; the re-
maining eight were the result of elimina-
tion rounds at the Sydney Bridge Club.
Tt was probably the best-quality field
which has appeared in Sydney. There
were the brilliant J. Griffiths and the
imperturbable C. Cadwallader, whose
successes this year made them logi-
cal favorites for this championship.
Mrs. Still, aged over 70, and proud
of it, was seen with the mercurial Mrs.
F. V. McAdam. The secretary of
the N.S.W.B.A., Mrs. Myra Milligen, and
her husband were competing. There,
too, were those prominent exponents of
the Sims system of bidding Mr. H.
Humphery and Miss Glynn Smith. Dr.
F. V. McAdam and his partner seemed
to be taking things seriously, and Mr.
L. Donaldson and Dr. Harris appeared
to value the job of 90 hands in front
of them.
The hands are to be played over
three sessions under the Howell match-
point scoring system. The best result
on each hand obtains what is called a
“top.” As there were eight tables on the
opening night, the “top” would beat seven
others and score seven points. Lower
results might get six, five or four points,
depending on whether they tied with
another pair or pairs ; the absolute worst
on each board is called a “bottom,” and
scores a nought. There are to be no
progress figures, a laudable idea which
stops unwarrantable “punting” on the part
of competitors who find they have done
badly in the early sessions. Calls which
would never be attempted under other
circumstances might unfairly hamper the
bidding of opponents running well in the
match.
When the first session had concluded
it was found that most of the bidding
and play had been of a high standard,
and, except on some of the “tricky”
deals, identical results were achieved at
a number of tables. Inevitably, however,
peculiar bids and plays were noticed.
Hand No. 9 provides an example of
an easy slam, which was arrived at by
practically all pairs.
South is the dealer, and East-West are
vulnerable.
The bidding is right along conventional
lines. After South’s pass, West bids one
heart, and is forced by East in the
diamonds. The hearts are not good
enough to rebid; the proper response is
three no-trumps. This elicits four no-
trumps from East, and the compulsory
five from West ensures the final call of
six hearts. This, of course, is a lay-down,
but in some cases the lead of the spade
knave presented the declarer with an
extra trick. Here, in my opinion, is a case
where the trump opening is indicated.
The bidding certifies the trump suit as
solid, and that the risk of a loser for
the opposition is in the side suits. North
has nothing, so he should protect his
partner by leaving the declarer to
develop his own tricks. This applies
forcibly to the Howell match-point
system, where the West players who were
presented with an extra trick get a better
score. Perhaps I speak feelingly, because
the trump was opened against me when
1 held the West hand.
Hand No. 6 is more interesting; at
one table it furnished an example of an
excellent sacrifice bid, which finally
broke even and very nearly saved 450 >
points. With West dealer and East-
West vulnerable, the cards were: —•
Various diamond openings, from one to
four, were made by West; at the table
mentioned West commenced with three
diamonds. North passed, and East said
three no-trumps. South, realising that
he had no defence against this or any
other declaration, gallantly puts in a bid
of four spades. West knows that this
can’t be got, but he refuses to accept a
penalty below the value of the game he
counts on, so he goes to five diamonds.
North is now under the whip ; he can
solidify the spade suit, but after that his
holding is worthless. Still, his partner’s
hand may be such that eight tricks can
be made for a penalty of 450. Against
that the opposition can get 600 for a
vulnerable game, and West’s opening bid
indicates the probability of honors, mak-
ing 700 in all. Three down in five spades
is therefore a save and four down is just
even. The hand was played in five spades
doubled.
South trumped the opening diamond,
and, taking the second trick with
dummy’s spade knave, led a small heart.
East ducked, and South’s six went to
West’s false queen. Another diamond
ruff and entry to North’s hand with the
trump queen brought a heart through
again. South’s problem is whether or
not to put up the king. If East held the
heart ace would he duck twice? West
must have an ace outside his diamond
suit. Is it hearts or clubs? The play
of the queen to the first heart trick may
mark the knave with East, Anyhow,
South let the nine of hearts run, and it
cost two tricks. I don’t blame him; I
think he played the correct card on the
knowledge at his disposal, and that he
was very unfortunate to sustain a penalty
of an extra two tricks instead of one.
Hand No. 29 is an instance of a re-
markable distribution where game in a
suit is an absolute certainty, but cannot
be bid by any rational methods. With
South dealer and East-West vulnerable
the hands were:
South opens with a club. West passes
and North bids a diamond. East passes,
and South, although technically he has no
further values beyond a possible rebid
of the length in the club suit, says one
heart. North doubtfully makes it two
hearts, which closes the conversation.
West opens a spade, and you will see that
four hearts cannot be defeated. As a
matter of fact, at one table six hearts
were made. Yet, looking at the hands, it is
hard to see how game in hearts can pos-
sibly be bid, although it is always there.
At another table • North-South, who
were in a position where something heroic
was needed to retrieve things, started
quietly with the club bid and diamond
response, and then gathered sufficient
momentum to send them into a three no-
trump contract. In ordinary circum-
stances this would be an impos-
sible bid. South can’t make it, unless he
receives support from his broken clubs
and possibly a rebid of the diamonds.
North can’t, as, from his point of view,
the only decent suit they have between
them would seem to be the hearts. How-
ever, three no-trumps was bid—and made,
a reward for that enterprise which must
never be lacking in the make-up of a
prospective champion.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
In the G. N. Steeple Redditch put up
as gallant a struggle as ever was witnessed
over Flemington fences. But the 12st.
7Jb. proved too much in opposition to
Woodlace (9st. 121 b.)- who had revealed
fine speed and stamina by capturing the
Steeplechasers’ Flat three days before.
Redditch jumped magnificently, and
when he drew to the front at the last
of the stand fences a runaway win for
the remainder of the journey appeared
probable. Only Woodlace could muster
enough energy to pursue the favorite
with effect. Six furlongs from home he
was on terms with Redditch, but at the
last of the river treble he blundered and
went down on his nose, and Alick Fqllar-
ton almost lost his seat. “It was the
only bad jump Woodlace made,” he said
afterwards. The gelding from S.A. had
never previously been over the “coun-
try.” Fullarton allowed him plenty of
time to regain balance. It was almost
pathetic to see the favorite floundering
under his big impost when Woodlace
ran past him. At little more than a
canter, Woodlace reached the judge six
lengths in advance of Redditch, with
Copperfield a furlong further away and
Ground Swell a poor fourth. The other

four starters failed to finish. Trafalable
broke a leg and had to be destroyed.
Woodlace took 6min. ll|sec. to cover
the three miles and a furlong. Redditch
put up the record of 6min. ssec. when
he scored 12 months ago. Early in the
week Woodlace was under offer to a
Melbourne sportsman for 800 guineas,
but no business resulted.
Fullarton, who was associated with the
National triumph of Sandhurst in 1929,
got the mount on Woodlace through
Whittaker, an Adelaide jockey, having
been injured on National Hurdle day.
Harry Butler owns and trains Woodlace,
who was beaten by the Victorian Ken-
jin in the Great Eastern Steeplechase at
Oakbank (S.A.) on Easter Monday. He
is by Backwood from Straitlace, by
Almissa.
Former Sydney jumping jockeys con-
tinue to occupy the limelight in Mel-
bourne. The engagement of Hynes to
ride Redditch in the G. N. Steeple was
an acknowledgment of his pre-eminence,
but Douglas, several years younger than
Hynes, is a serious rival. Douglas won
the G. N. Hurdle on Prismatic, and on
the final day landed the Trial Hurdle
with Rodda, after being second in the
Doutta Galla Hurdle on Prismatic. The
Doutta Galla and Trial Hurdles brought
grist to the mill of the bookmakers, who
moaned dreadfully over the results of
Wednesday’s races. Prismatic was van-
quished in the Doutta Galla by The
Mirror, a 15-to-l chance, trained by A.
D. Webster. Webster had made a rich
haul over Prostration in the Iramoo
Welter (second division) on the opening
day. As The Mirror was runner-up to
Ortalan in the Keilor Hurdle on Wednes-
day, he should have been in more request
on Saturday, but punters erroneously
reckoned that the issue rested between
Prismatic, Dark Man and Ortalan.
Douglas earned much praise for his
handling of Rodda. The Western
District horse was not brought on the
scene until Sarakos knocked up in trying^
to steal the race. Waiting for the last
run, Douglas brought Rodda home an
easy winner from Windleon and Seven
Hills. The favorite, Countermarch, was
narrowly beaten for third place, but
shaped a long way below expectations.
Tote backers of Rodda for a win re-
ceived over 30 to 1.
Noel Soldat, favorite for the July Han-
dicap, and Count Orloff, another short-
priced candidate, almost fell just after
the start through Gallibrook crossing
over to the rails from an outside berth.
The stewards suspended Gallibrook’s
rider, an apprentice, for one month.
Gallibrook led until collared by Semitist
(12 to 1), who scored by half a length.
Noel Soldat put in such a fine finishing
effort that he may have been unlucky
to lose.
* * * *
Queenslanders in Sydney grinned when
the Canterbury handicapper gave
Regular Bachelor, about the best two-
year-old in their State, only six pounds
more than the minimum in the Nursery
Handicap. The presence of the Bache-
lor’s Persse colt caused the owners of
half a dozen youngsters in his division
to take them out, and sportsmen from
the north had to lay 6 to 4 on. They
had thrills before they collected. Regu-
lar Bachelor’s rider took a pull at the
Leger when he had the race well in
hand, and Booth’s filly Pavarti just failed
to reach him. He is a handsome young-
ster with powerful quarters, but is rather
heavy in the shoulders, and sprinting will
be his forte. His dam, Regulate, is by
Highfield from Regulator, by Havoc, and
was bred by Mrs. J. H. Barnes.
In the second division Walter Brunton
scored with Cantaloupe, a smart-looking
filly by Canusa from a Cicerio mare,
Lindis Lady. She started at fives. The
favorite, Rosinver, could only run third.
Ridden by the apprentice Zensky,
Leila Vale was sent out in capital trim
by Booth for the Flying Handicap, and
was backed from tens to fours. Caravel
Boy essayed to lead all the way, but
was “walking” over the last furlong.
Leila Vale —a bonny mare now —won
easily from the favorite, Golden Gate,
who moved off slowly. Leila Vale is
in the Epsom with 7st. 121 b., and this
race will be her mission in the spring.
First Balloon is consistent. She went
out at twelves for the Canterbury Handi-
cap and, leading over the last three fur-
longs, outstayed the unlucky Mountain
View, who looked a winner when Bartle
dashed him through on the rails.
Semmak was third ; Headgale, the favor-
ite, gave an inglorious display. First
Balloon is in the Metrop. with 6st. 101 b.
It was fortunate for the Persian party
that Jonker was considered to be a rod
in pickle for the Campsie Handicap.
Jonker was supported from sevens to
threes, so Persian eased from evens to
twos. Despite his 9st. 121 b., Bartle took
;Persian to the front, and he was never
headed, though Jonker made a great
effort in the straight; Moallin was a fair
third. Tapestry shaped really well to
run fourth, and should win races in
weaker company. Persian’s spring en-
gagements include the Epsom with 7st.
121 b. He has already been specked in
doubles with leading Metrop. candidates.
Marsh Off (20 to 1) was cheered by the
bookies when he won the first division of
the Park Stakes; the 6-to-4 favorite,
Full Wind, by Windbag, sweated freely
before going to the barrier, and failed
to gain a place.
Peter Pan’s stable-mate Cid put up a
meritorious performance in the second
division. Badly drawn at the barrier, he
was not well served when it rose, but
Keith Cook drove him along on the out-
side, and he quickly put daylight between
him and the leaders. Cid won by six
lengths in Imin,. 15isec., time which
beat Leila Vale’s by a quarter of a
second. He is in the Epsom with 7st. 41b.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Until the buffoonery began Tommy
Nylan and George Penchiff provided
capital wrestling at Leichhardt. Nylan
forward-slammed and then pinned the
Bulgarian in the third round. Penchiff
squared matters with a short-arm-
scissors hold in the fifth. In the sixth
Nylan lost his temper, or made a show
of losing it. He twice knocked the
referee down with left-hand slaps (Lurich
was referee), and was disqualified at
the instance of a police-officer who didn’t
see the joke.
Woodfull’s Men
Yorkshire won the toss against Aus-
tralia at Bramall Lane and decided to
bat, the wicket being soaked by over-
night rain and the ball coming through
straight and easy, while bowlers had to
contend with insecure foothold and a
slimy ball. In spite of the advantage,
Yorkshire made no attempt to force the
scoring, and a dreary performance ended
on Saturday evening with six Tykes out
for 238.
Sutcliffe was the first to go for a
deadly-slow innings of 19. He was well
run out by Fleetwood-Smith and Barnett.
The others went on to score steadily, if
stodgily: Mitchell (35), Barber (37), Ley-
land (43), helped by Sellers (49 n. 0.) and
Smailes (29 n. 0.). Smailes, a professional
recruit to Yorkshire last season, then
had a batting average of 4.57 and took
6 wickets for 23.16 apiece.
Ebeling (2-59), Grimmett (2-68) and
Bromley (1-41) were the wicket-takers.

Footbrawl
Melbourne’s chief League game last
Saturday, drew a 30,000 crowd and
proved an attractive, though too-
strenuous, show. Carlton’s Blues, visit-
ing Collingwood, found high-marking
difficult, and let loose vigorous drives
down the centre. The Magpies met force
with force, and presently umpire Scott,
who handled a tough game well, had
to suspend proceedings for a few minutes.
Opening up the play the Blues did better,
but were countered by the Magpies’ per-
sistent backing up and their uncanny
accuracy in passing. The Mags, forged
ahead till in the third quarter, with’Wood
attacking against the wind, two players got
into holts, and others joined in. Some-
one passed Syd Coventry an uppercut,
and play was again held up. Three men
will toe the carpet over that. There-
after there was football, fast, clever,
pretty to watch, but the locals were too
good for the Blues, and the game ended:
’Wood, 95; Carlton, 65. Whelan, Le
Brun and Regan were best for the
winners ; Crisp, Gill and Mackie for the
losers. Richmond Tigers, on their own
ground, found Fitzroy better than ex-
pected, and the Maroons did so
well near the end that Richmond was
lucky to win, by 76 to ’Roy’s 63. Gee-
long routed Footscray by 93 to 64.. South
Melbourne, likewise at home, put it all
over St. Kilda to the tune of 110 to 46 ;
and Hawthorn, by gathering in 53 points
to North Melbourne’s 48, prevented that
team from spoiling the immaculateness
of its unbroken egg. Melbourne visited
Essendon and collected the laurels by
60 to 51.

After winning a very rough mid-week
game against Brisbane, the N.S.W.
League footballers in Queensland went
down to the home side in the second
inter-State game by 22 to 20, scoring
6 tries to 4 and 2 goals to 4.
In the League grade games in Sydney
Western Suburbs, though weakened by
players absent in Queensland with the
inter-State team, easily downed Newtown,
the premiers, by 25 to 17. Eastern
Suburbs won 32-18 from Balmain, and
St. George prevailed over North Sydney
by 19 to 8. South Sydney obliterated
University by 30 to 5.

Sydney Rugby Union club fixtures
saw Randwick take a lead of four points,
though the club only won from the weak
Eastern Suburbs team by a lucky
dropped goal at the last moment, scores
closing 17-13 in Randwick’s favor.
Northern Suburbs and University pro-
vided a great game, Northern win-
ning 14-11 on its home ground. Drum-
moyne had all the better of its tussle
with Parramatta, winning 22-6, while
Manly proved too solid for St. George
at Hurstville, scoring 13-3.

“Gate”: The League football club
at Sydney Uni. has always been a wisht
and sickly bantling. For most of its
existence it has been the joke of the
League competitions, and this season its
performances have been so pathetic that
a rumor gained ground that the League
was preparing to strangle its offspring in
despair. There were wild questions by
Uni. delegates at a recent League meet-
ing, but the club was assured that its
execution hadn’t even been discussed.
(Continued on page 36.)
The Nineteenth Hole
Two important associate golf events
came off last week. In Sydney, Joan
Hammond, championette in 1932, re-
gained the State title after a sterling dis-
play, finishing 9 and 8- after taking the
first 11 holes in a row. Her opponent,
Betty Gowing, fought back valiantly, but
in vain. At Melbourne, Mrs. Sloan
Morpeth, once Susie Tolhurst, was beaten
in the Victorian championship, her oppo-
nent being sister Shirley. This is the
winner’s first State title.
* * * *
Jim Ferrier, of Manly club, added the
N.S.W. golf championship to his long
list of scalps at the week-end when he
downed the Queensland crack, J. N, Rad-
cliffe, 9 and 8, at Kensington. Ferrier’s
stroke round was approximately 72, and
the accuracy of his approach shots and
putting dumbfounded the big gallery.
(Continued on page 38.)
Racquet and Bawl
The Australian Davis Cuppers won
from Czecho-Slovakia by the skin of
their teeth, qualifying for the European
zone final by three matches to two.
Menzel downed both McGrath and
Crawford, the former giving him the
most trouble. Crawford beat Hecht
and won the doubles with Quist from
Menzel and Hecht. The issue depended
on the final singles, and here McGrath,
after a bad start, won the last three sets
off the reel and clinched matters. The
Americans are the next hurdle.

“Thormanby”: The connection be-
tween Australian jockey “Togo” John-
stone and the shipping-racing magnate
Lord Glanely did not last long, the
pair having parted by mutual agreement
and without tears. Apparently the
failure of Johnstone to bring the over-
boomed Colombo home in the Derby
soured his Ludship, though the best jock,
in the world cannot make a proved non-
stayer win over a bit of distance. The
Bulletin voiced its suspicions of
Colombo’s staying powers after he won
the Two Thousand, and not only the
Derby result, but those of the races at
Ascot, in which the colt failed badly,
bore out the doubt. Johnstone went
back to France, where he has been a
very successful rider, and celebrated his
return by winning the Grand Prix du
President de la Republique on Assuerus,
a four-year-old by Asterus, second on
the French list of winning sires last year.
“D.E.”: In recent Court proceedings
at Sdyney it was stated that Johnstone
was earning £lO,OOO p.a. It seems un-
likely that he will make that any more ;
but you never know. “Togo’s” horseman-
ship has been the subject of a bitter con-
troversy in England ; it began long
before the Derby. Australian opinion
is that he is a good rough jockey, at his
best on an animal that needs kicking
along ; but he is not to be classed with
Pike or Duncan.

At the dispersal sale of A. P. Wade's
Borombola stud, near Wagga (N.S.W.),
stallion Marconigram (imp.), by Abbot’s
Trace—Marcia Blanche, and 33 mares,
all served by him, brought a total of
£7llO. Marconigram went to A. W.
Thompson, of Weddin, in conjunction
with H. S. Thompson and P. C. Basche,
for 3050 guineas. He was foaled in 1925.
The mares averaged close on 1124:
guineas, though as low as four and five-
pounds were paid for two of them. Top
price was 500gns. for Purple Lilac, by
Martian—Persian Lilac (imp.).

“Chiverton”: J. G. McDougall, of
Lyndhurst stud on the Darling Downs,
has added a promising sire to his string.
This is Fox-Earth, imported to replace
Seremond, recently destroyed. Fox-
Earth, who ran in the King’s colors in
England and proved himself a stayer, is
an upstanding brown by Foxlaw from
Wireless, and is, of course, a descendant
of the Duke of Westminster’s Flying Fox,
winner of the triple crown in 1899 and
one of England’s greatest sires in his day.

“Lug-Biter”: A queer charge was laid
against two Adelaide men under
the new Gaming Act, and they were
fined for “having, for a fee, given
oral information as to the pro-
bable result of a race to be run that
day.” If the South Australian Act held
good throughout Australia most of this
country’s population would have to face
the beak sooner or later. In this case,
the plaintiff must have been an unusually
optimistic lad, for the evidence showed
that the chief of the defendants was an
advertising salesman as well as a tipster.

“Eagle Farm”: Continuous wet
weather early in the season told against
Q.T.C. attendances, but the Bananaland
club wound up with a clear profit of
£640. Prize-money had to be reduced to
balance the budget, the total for the year
being £42,245, or £7640 less than the year
before. The club raced on 25 days
instead of 28, and that accounts for some
£4OOO of the difference. Revenue was
£73,345, a drop of £12,674. The pro-
gramme next season will probably
include a “C. A. Morris Stakes,” in
honor of a chairman who has given the
club notable service for years.
“Sparks”: The rider of the racehorse
electrocuted by the leak of current (B.
27/6/’34) did not necessarily owe his
escape to the perfect insulation of his
clothing and equipment. The chances
are that even if he had been riding bare-
backed in singlets and shorts he
would have suffered no serious harm.
Of all animals horses are most
susceptible to discharges of current; in
other words, they are good conductors of
electricity. The effect of small bat-
teries on them is known to most readers
of turf news. The electrical engineer of
a N.S.W. municipality on the North
Shore line grew tired of passing for pay-
ment claims for horses electrocuted in a
paddock where current was leaking but
over which other animals grazed and
in which children played with immu-
nity. What happens is that the leaking
current, finding the horse an easier path
than the ground, flies up through its
body. The effect of the same voltage
and amperage on cats would hardly be
sufficient to interrupt a nocturnal concert.
WoodfulFs Men
The third Test at Manchester may have
had its purple moments, but on the whole
it conveyed to the wearied listener at
this end an impression that it was a
battle of mediocrities, and that a draw
was a fitting finish to it. This was par-
ticularly true of the bowling on both
sides, except that of O’Reilly and Verity.
Bad fielding contributed to the tremen-
dous scoring, but the quality of the bowl-
ing was to blame. Never was the folly
of sending only two class bowlers to
England more vividly illustrated, and, if
Woodfull didn’t feel pangs of regret that
he arid his selector colleagues had kept
“W’ere’ll I dump yer, Bill?”
“On th ' reporters; I want ter make an impression on th’ press."
Oxenham out of the team, he is more
than human.
England seems in little better case as
far as bowling is concerned. Apart from
Verity, no one has yet been produced of
the class of O’Reilly and Grimmett,
though a dozen changes have been tried
to date. Once more the fast bowlers, of
whom so much was hoped, have proved a
frost. There are bound to be some bowl-
ing changes for the fourth Test, which
starts at Leeds on July 20.
McCabe and Brown resumed batting
on Monday morning, with Ponsford gone
and 136 up. When Brown departed after
a sterling shot for 72, there were 230 on
the board. McCabe ended a dashing
innings of 137 when Verity caught him
off Hammond, but Woodfull (73), Dar-
ling (37) and Bradman (30) made solid
contributions. When Woodfull was
foolishly run out by Oldfield, and the
latter followed swiftly for 13, 67 runs
were required to save the follow-on.
Chipperfield, leaving his bed against
doctor’s orders, joined Grimmett, who
promptly departed for a duck. Things
looked blue, but Chipperfield batted
pluckily for 26 and went at 454. The
alleged dud batsmen of the side, O’Reilly
and Wall, then took charge of the situa-
tion and raised the total to 491, 13 runs
to the good, before Wall was run out for
18. O’Reilly made 30 n. 0., his biggest
Test innings, and one that, in the cir-
cumstances, was worth any ordinary cen-
tury. Verity took 4 for 78, Hammond
3 for 111. Fast bowlers Clark and Allen
did little good.
Wyatt batted again, but the innings
was an anti-climax. No one bothered
much when he closed without loss at
123, Walters and Sutcliffe being 50 and
69 n.o. respectively. Brown went for a
duck, to Allen this time, and then Pons-
ford (30 n. 0.) and McCabe (33 n. 0.)
batted on leisurely until the shutters went
up half an hour before time with no one
complaining, even among the spectators.
* * * *
The eighteenth match of the Austra-
lian tour against Derbyshire at Chester-
field was won by nine wickets. Derby-
shire is far from being a weak county,
having filled sixth place in the cham-
pionship last season, while three of the
batsmen topped the 1000 runs. The side
also includes slow-bowler Mitchell, here
with lardine. The match was consider-
ably hampered by rain, but this kept the
wicket easy.
Batting first Derbyshire totted up 145,
Storer, son of the ’keeper here with Stod-
dart in 1897-98, top-scoring with 40, while
Ford, an old Oxford Blue, hit up 37.
Ebeling was the destroyer, taking 5 for
28. The Aussies found Mitchell’s slows
a hurdle, and the little Chap came out
with 7 for 105. Bradman headed the scor-
ing with 71. Woodfull suffered his third
successive run-out after reaching 44.
Bromley, sent in first to buck him up,
played his best shot for a long time with
31, while Barnett, as usual, had some runs
up his sleeve and produced 48 —all out
for 255. Storer again led the county
score with 47, but the side went for 139,
Fleetwood-Smith (5-38) doing the
damage. Ebeling took two more wickets,
and bowled in such form generally that
he has made his marble pretty good for
the Leeds Test this week. The 30 runs
to win were got for the loss of Brown’s
wicket.
* * * *
“Black and White”: The O’Reilly-
Wall last-wicket stand at Old Trafford
calls to mind a chat I had with Wall
when he was playing with the Colts’ team
in the S.A.C.A. and had not yet gained
the State side. I met him returning from
practice at Adelaide Oval. Tim had
apparently been having a day out with
the bat, and was highly elated because
coach Arthur Richardson told him that
if he kept on like that he’d be getting
into the S.A. team as a batsman before
he ever got in as a bowler. The tip
was a long way wide of the mark, but
I wonder whether “AJ.” recalled it when
he watched Wall holding his end up last
week.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: The spectacle of sick
cricketers side-stepping the quacks and
the nurses to immolate themselves on the
altar of patriotism is no new one. In
addition to the Australian instance in
the third Test, there has hardly been time
yet to forget the temporary resurrection
of Paynter in the fourth Test at
Brisbane with scores of 83 and 14 n. 0.,
which practically won the match for
Jardine’s lot. The outstanding instance
was that of Ranji at Sydney in 1897-98.
He was in hospital with quinsy when
Stoddart’s team was to meet N.S.W.
Ranji batted in the face of all opposition,
scoring 189.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: It followed as the
night the day that O’Reilly’s success
brought him offers from League clubs.
The news was received with the usual
yelps of foreboding by the sensational
press. “It would be a tragedy if such a
champion... .was lost to us,” one rag
remarked. Bill is under contract not to
go back to England for cricket until two
years after his return, so the “tragedy”
is a long way off.
* #
“Cela”: Reading of Hendren dropping
a “sitter” in the slips recalls an old
story the late George Lohmann used to
tell. He was alone in a railway com-
partment between two county matches
when a man got in and dropped into the
opposite seat. Though the evening was
warm, the newcomer had the collar of
his overcoat turned up and a large
muffler wound round his throat. He
looked so pale and distressed that George
asked him if he could be of any help.
His vis-a-vis countered by asking, in a
hoarse whisper, if he had ever played
cricket, and, on George admitting he had,
inquired if he had ever fielded in the
slips. The reply to this was also “yes.”
And the next question was: “What would
you do if you were fielding in the slips
and dropped four catches in one over?”
George considered this for a while and
replied “I think I’d cut my throat.”
In a hoarser whisper than ever, the
stranger gasped “I have!”
Footbrawl
“Hotham”: Melbourne V.F.L. clubs
have been dissatisfied for some time past
with the method in vogue of dividing
the gates. The people owning the ground
—usually a cricket club—get first cut,
and a solid one. Then the winning club
takes its whack and the loser something
less. Ground expenses, usually running
well over £lOO, are also deducted from
the gross. The opening match of the

RHEUMATISM
SCIATICA
NEURITIS'
SAYS Dr. D. Jacobsen - noted medical authority
It is definitely established that
modern foods do not stimulate the
bowel muscles to sufficient action.
Consequently, though your habits
be regular, particles of food-waste
are left in the folds and crevices of
the intestine. These fragments of
food-waste remain in the colon
day after day sometimes for
weeks or months—decaying and
breeding germs and poisons which
enter the blood-stream and pro-
duce the condition known as Self-
poisoning or “ Autoxima,” from
which nine out of ten suffer.
WHAT DOCTORS SAY
Medical opinion now regards Self-
poisoning as one of the principal
causes of ill-health. Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Neuritis, Headaches, In-
digestion, Constipation, Bladder
Ailments, Depression, Weakness,
Catarrh, Eczema, Skin Troubles
and a host of minor aches and
pains can now be traced to this in-
sidious enemy of health.

years ago ? Then get rid of Self-
poisoning. Drink Coloseptic in hot
water every morning. Coloseptic
is a tonic that cleanses the en-
crusted waste from the intestines
without griping or inconvenience.
It strengthens intestinal muscles
so that your bowels function nat-
urally and regularly. It tones up
the whole digestive tract. Colo-
septic cleans the blood-stream of
poisonous acids and wastes by
exerting a powerful action upon
the kidneys. It stimulates Nature’s
other great eliminatory organs
the pores of the skin and the re-
spiratory tract. Coloseptic gives
you the complete internal clean-
ness which is the first step to per-
fect health. It prevents germs and
toxins from generating and being
absorbed.

all other matches. League football in
Melbourne is a costly game, and the
clubs consider they should get a bigger
bite of the cake. One thing they ask
is that the cost of putting the teams in
the field each week should come out of
gross receipts.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Nothing has stimulated
the ingenuity of Melbourne football
officials more than the “Coulter law”
that the payment or offer of a lump
sum of money or its equivalent to secure
or retain the services of any footballer
is illegal. Penalties are a fine of £250
and a loss of premiership points by the
club and the disqualification of the
players involved. Essendon has come
out in the open and flatly accused Carl-
ton of buying ’bailers from Brunswick on
the hoof. Everyone knows that the law
is being dodged in all sorts of ways, but
this is the first time anyone has made
a fuss about it.
H= * * *
“Eden Park”: The All-Blacks due
here on July 28 are about the beefiest
batch to cross the Tasman, if the weigh-
ing machines are right. Backs average
list. 81b., and forwards 14st. 21b., the
pony of the vanguard being Leeson, who
owns to a modest 13st. "They are said to
be fast, but that can only be by com-
parison. People with real pace aren’t
built on those lines, as a rule. If the
grounds on this side are hard I anticipate
some of these weight-carriers will have to
be fired or blistered before the end of
their tour.

“Old Q.”: In these days, when brawn
is the first desideratum for a Rugby
player, it is refreshing to note that the
ponderous All-Black team to visit Aus-
tralia includes at least one player of
under lOst. This is Corner, a 9st. 91b.
scrum-half who was a prominent figure
against the last Australian team in M.L.
He is a replica of A. L. (“Skeeter”)
Humphries, who wore the All-Black
jersey in Australia in 1897 and 1903,
and in M.L. in 1901. He tipped the
beam at 9st. 71b., but was one of the
Dominion’s best halves in his day.
* *
“Cash Amateur”: Though the Inter-
national Rugby Board has several times
announced in disapproving tones that
getting football teams together for in-
tensified coaching some time before the
match “savors strongly of professional-
ism,” the N.S.W. Union apparently
intends to follow the practice. Some-
thing certainly needs to be done in the
way of coaching the side, and especially
the forwards, on their showing against
Queensland and Victoria. In those
matches there were far too many bright
and shiny lads looking tor openings in
loose and hanging out of the heavy
r uck work. To stage that sort of stuff
against the All-Blacks amounts to suicide
j n a football sense
* *' * *
“Stoush”: The N.S.W. Rugby League
has been considering the disqualification
for life of a junior footballer. A strong
objection to such extreme penalty was
voiced by a Mr. Benning, a delegate
from the University League club. In his
opinion, no player should be outed for
the term of his natural unless he had
killed another player “or a referee.”
Footballers will wonder why Benning
dragged in the referee.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: Kirkwood and Sarazen
have notified their Australian agents that
they will be in Australia in the second
week in September ready to tour the
various States. They returned to America
after the British open, and will figure in
the American professional championship
at the end of the month, leaving after
that for this country. They will thus land
in plenty of time for the Australian
championships at Rose Bay (N.S.W.) in
October, and will compete in these in
addition to showing in other engage-
ments.
:\i :*c %
“Divot Digger”: Though a bit over-
shadowed by the amateur championships
at Kensington, the annual battle for the
N.S.W. professional golfers’ cup, which
took place at Manly last week, provided
some fine golf. There were 30 entrants
for the 36 holes of stroke play, and the
affair ended in a neck-and-neck battle
between C. Gray and W. Bolger, who
tied with 150. They played off over
nine holes, but were still level and agreed
to another two. Gray got his nose in
front and won by a stroke. S.
Richardson, holder of the pot, finished
fifth with Frank Eyre, each having a
card of 153.
“Baffy”: The outlook for a visit from
the American professional golfers (B.
11/7/ ’34) is brightening. Last week the
V.G.A. toed the mark and offered to
find £5OO of Ihe £l5OO guarantee asked
by the Yanks, a guarantee hitherto
refused by the centenary tourney folk.
The P.G.A. of N.S.W. has coppered
the bet with another £5OO. It now seems
up to the N.S.W. golf controllers, who
have been obdurate in refusing counten-
ance of any kind to Victoria’s schemes,
to find the other third. Apart from the
centenary events the visitors will be free
to make their owrt engagements in the
other States.
* * * *
“Shirley”: The Melbourne centenary
golf tourney will see Maoriland’s finest
player, A. J. Shaw, taking part. Shaw is
open and professional champion of the
Dominion. He won the open in 1926-
29-30-31-32, and the professional title in
1928-29-31-32-33. His example has im-
mensely improved the standard of Maori-
land golf, and he was the first player
in the Shivery Isles to break 70.
* * * *
“Woogaroo”: The long Goodna course
(6600 yards) is to have the honor of
being the venue of the first Queensland
close championship in August. It is
a severely bunkered links, and a member,
G. Watson, has put up a cup for the
player who first breaks 70 in an open
event. So far it remains unclaimed.
* * * *
“Whirroo”: Reverend Father Hogan,
parish priest at Ashgrove (Q.), caused a
surprise by qualifying for the club cham-
pionship at Royal Queensland. A
powerful hitter, he is a stout opponent,
and was only eliminated in the semi-
finals after a close fight by Dr. Geo.
Thompson, regarded, since Stan Keane’s
departure, as the club’s best player.
Racquet and Bawl
“Centre Court”: Perry’s victory in the
All England championships was overdue
—it is the first time a Briton has won the
title for 25 years. The same time has
elapsed since the Cold Country brought
off the men’s and women’s singles double.
A. W. Gore was the last native son to
take the title—that was in 1909. The
same year Miss D. Boothby won the
women’s event. After that the English-
women scored several times, but were not
supported by their menfolk, who began a
long succession of also-rans when Tony
Wilding lifted the title in 1910.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: Crawford’s form in
Europe this year has been far below that
of last year. Indeed, since his collapse
against Perry in America, he has been
playing like a sleepwalker for the most
part. Not that his play has been bad, but,
after making the running for most of the
way and looking a winner at the distance,
he has shut up under the whip. Seven
times in succession in big events he has
reached the finals and been beaten in the
decider. For the U.S.A., Victorian, Aus-
tralian and All England championships
and the British hardcourts championship
he was beaten by Perry. Quist beat him
for the Queensland title and Von Cramm
in the French championship. This is his
worst spin since he entered big tennis.
* * * *
“Milton”: Queensland tennis selectors
have picked their team to meet N.S.W.
early in August, and the selection has
caused some heartburnings. Moon, still
the best of the Bananalanders, is first on
the list and captain, the others being
Cummings, Grinstead, Goodwin, Chave
and Duncan Thompson. Thompson’s
selection ahead of Brimson and Hand-
cock has been responsible for most of
the outcry. The footballer of other days
has come on well at tennis, but the im-
pression in Brisbane seems to be that his
inclusion ahead of some of the others is
just a sweetener for the Red Mud city,
which is not friendly with its metropoli-
tan cobbers just now.
“Amateur Pro.”: Those N.S.W. tennis
players who may harbor qualms of con-
science as to their amateur status may
find profit in a recent announcement of
the State L.T.A. This is that unless they
receive permission from the tin gods to
play with or against a professional in
exhibition matches they are in imminent
danger of being hurled into outer dark-
ness. The heads held an inquest on
Aubrey Willard, his name having
appeared with J. O. Anderson’s in an
advertisement of an exhibition match.
Willard denied all knowledge of the
affair, and his employers said that he was
employed as a traveller only, and J. O.
Anderson as a coach. The pair had
occasionally smacked a ball about in
practice, but nothing more. The heads
graciously decided that if Willard
abstained from demonstrations before
pupils with Anderson he would remain
as whaite as the beautiful snow.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: British tennis is
perturbed because its curled darling,
“Bunny” Austin, Has been near to
“blurtin’ oot the truth,” as the Scottish
meenister said. Austin says that, unless
matches are shortened, tennis will have to
become completely professional. Tennis
has arrived at a stage when it demands
all a leading player’s time, making it
“impossible for a man to carry on
ordinary life and compete in champion-
ships.” Austin thinks that three-set
matches will do a lot to reduce the
physical strain and give people who really
want to work for a living a chance to
compete. Nothing very new in all that,
but it is interesting as coming straight
from the horse’s mouth, so to speak.
Miscellaneous
“Shrewsbury”: England managed to
hang on to the Grand Challenge Cup at
Henley this year, winning the final from
Princeton University (U.S.A.) by three-
quarters of a length. Leander was the
victorious crew, and how the Yankees
made the old club travel can be seen
from the hot time of 6min. 45sec., a
record for the race. The Diamond Sculls
was fought out between America and
Germany, R. Buhtz, from Hitlerland,
beating W. Rutherford by 3| lengths in
Bmin. lOsec.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Melbourne’s Henley-on-
Yarra authorities are gleeful at the pros-
pect of an entry in both rowing and
sculling events from M.L. The Union
Boat Club, of Wanganui, has been asked
to make the trip, and is nosing round for
funds. This club had six men in the
Wanganui eight which won the last M.L.
inter-province championship. Inver-
cargill Railway R.C. has notified that
four of its members will be in Melbourne
for the regatta, and, if it can find a boat,
will have a go in the junior fours. From
England C. Baillieu, who has been
negotiating, says he is hopeful one of the
leading English crews will make the trip

Business, Robbery, Etc.
Unpleasant Recollections
A full-page advertisement in Brisbane
“Courier-Mail” of July 4 carries the
“complete prospectus” of GKP-Projec-
tion (Australia), Ltd. Nominal capital
is £50,000 in £1 shares; 25,000 are
offered to the public, and 5000 are to go
to the “vendor,” who is also to get
£7OOO in cash (“by instalments”).
The £12,000 taken by the vendor (out
of a proposed initial capital of £30,000)
is consideration for the Commonwealth
rights in a projection machine for adver-
tising, etc., on screens, hoardings or
walls. The vendor is unnamed. Three
directors have been appointed so far: a
Consul for Austria, a Sydney solicitor
and “Percy Freeman, Esq., J.P., grazier
and company manager, Wingello House,
Angel-place, Sydney.” Percy Freeman
is also mentioned as having entered into
a contract with the company.
About the middle of 1926 Percy Free-
man promoted the co. which subse-
quently became Motor and Cash Orders,
Ltd. He took a job as managing-director
for five years at £2OOO a year and the
right to 10 p.c. commission on the sale of
the scrip. About the time Freeman’s con-
tract ran out the auditors estimated that
£48,454 of the paid capital (including
most of the ordinary) had disappeared in
preliminary exes., losses and bad debts.
Preliminary exes. (£21,240) were astonish-
ingly heavy. Later balance sheets are not
to hand.
About March, 1928, Percy Freeman
was behind the flotation of the Mercan-
tile Bank of Australia. Though it was a
hopeless proposition from the outset,
50,000 £5 prefs. were offered at a pre-
mium of £1 each, and 100,000 £5 ords.
at par.
The “bank” never opened its doors.
The public subscribed 2332 prefs., 3773
“A” prefs. and 4262 ords. At the date
the winding-up petition was presented—
it was a matter of two or three years
after flotation —£16,475 had been paid
up by shareholders. At one stage of the
liquidation .the only cash left in the busi-
ness was about £9OO ; yet the directors
put in a claim for £2OOO unpaid fees!
The unfortunate ord. shareholders had
to be called upon to repay the pref.
share claims and the debts of the co.
It was a sorry business.
GKP-Projection (Aust.), Ltd., the
latest concern to carry the name of Percy
Freeman on its board, is registered under
the ancient N.S.W. Companies Act. Yet
the main assault on the investment
market —if newspaper advertising is any
guide-—seems to have been made in
Queensland. “Federal Security Co.” is
the Brisbane representative, but persons
desiring information as to contracts en-
tered into are referred to the co.’s solici-
tor ; he is the legal man on the board,
and his office is in Sydney.
Of the shares to be issued, 10,000 are
said to have been “firmly underwritten”
—by whom it is not stated. “No esti-
mates [of profits] are offered to investors,
because the possibilities are; boundless.”
Preliminary exes, are to be borne by
the company, and the co. goes to allot-
ment immediately.
Britain wants to impose either a quan-
titative restriction or a levy on im-
ported beef and mutton to assist the
home industry. Under the Ottawa agree-
ment it became entitled to regulate meat
imports from the Dominions after June
30 last. Australia objects to restriction
and Argentina to a levy. As “an emer-
gency measure” British beef is to be
subsidised.
* * * *
The founders of the Australian wine
industry were unhonored in their own
day, and have been little considered
since ; but recognition will come. During
the first four months of the present year
Britain imported more wine in casks
from Australia than from any other
country. The list, measured in gallons,
runs: Australia, 1,195,756 ; Portugal,
1,095,169; Spain, 1,075,132; France,
378,379; Union of South Africa,
307,279; Italy, 179,143; other foreign
countries, 90,398.
* * * *
The wine bounty is to be continued
for five years. It provides assistance to
growers on a sliding scale. Under the
operation of the bounty Australia’s wine
exports grew from 1,085,000 gallons in
1926 to 2,628,000 gallons last season,
according to Hutchinson, M.H.R. Under
the new Bounty Act co-operative cos.
will have to pay growers within a reason-
able time. The maximum proportion of
proof spirit for fortification purposes in
wines for export has been raised from
40 to 42 p.c.
“No, Dr. Stiffness that’s not right."
On June 30 there were just on 600,000
wireless licenses in force throughout the
Commonwealth. Net increase for June
was 25,044. In Vic. there were 11.4
licenses to every 100 of population; in
S. Aus. the figure was 10.9, in N.S.W.
8.7, Westralia 7.2, Queensland 5.5 and
Tas. 7.1.

New England Airways, conductor of
the aerial passenger service between
Sydney and Brisbane, is to be taken over
by a co. formed in Britain which intends
to extend the service to Melbourne. The
Sydney-Melbourne ’plane will leave at
six o’clock in the evening, landing in the
southern capital about eleven. This
night-flying should allow a passenger to
leave Brisbane in the morning and arrive
in Melbourne at night. It is intended to
maintain many of the present feeder
lines, and probably to extend them.
Special facilities in the way of aerial
lighthouses, radio beacons and landing-
grounds will be laid down over the night
route. The British Pacific Trust is con-
nected with the new co., and Wing-
Commander Wackett is to be technical
manager.

Before the Wheat Commission, Aleck
Scott Osborne, assistant g.-m. of the
Commercial of Sydney, said that 25 p.c.
of the bank’s wheat-farmer clients were
reducing their debts ; some were strug-
gling to keep their liability from increas-
ing, and managing to do it; a large
number was not paying interest in full.
The C.B.S. took special care to avoid
lending money in N.S.W. areas where the
industry is more speculative. The bank
had not made any great advances to the
industry during the past three years, said
Mr. Osborne, but growers were given
assistance wherever circumstances justi-
fied it.

An amendment to the Vic. Companies
Act was before the Legislative Council
last week ; Harold Cohen, who introduced
the bill, said that it required a certi-
ficate of profits and finances covering the
three preceding years to be inserted in
the prospectus of every co. asking the
public for money. In the case of entirely
new enterprises, of course, this would not
be necessary. The directors would be
personally liable for the contents of the
statement. The bill also provides for the
prohibition of share- and debenture-
hawking, but it is doubtful whether this
provision extends to forestry bonds.
N. S. Wales Parliament is soon to con-
sider legislation dealing with gold-mining
cos. Persons issuing prospectuses will
be made responsible for publication of
false reports. Reggie Lloyd, M.L.A.,
raised the question in the House,
pointing out the difficulties which the
crash of wild-cat enterprises throws in the
path of bona fide mining concerns.

“King D.”: Gold went up to £6 18s.
in London last week, the highest price
for some weeks. Sydney Stock Exchange
activity in gold shares was the lowest for
months, and the whole price-range was
weak. Such is the strange psychology
of mining punters. Forward dealing has
been suspended for the time being, and
gambling stopped. Following the Tulla-
more disclosures the market got cold
feet, which shows how little it really
knows about many mines. Scrip in those
concerns which have mines to work
should be worth picking up now by those
who don’t mind waiting a bit. Genuine
mines, properly managed, should get the
benefit of a high gold price for a good
while yet.

The Newnes committee has investigated
the possibility of using compressed coal
gas in motor-vehicles; it finds that the
steel cylinders necessary would limit
practical use to heavy lorries and ’buses,
which could be run on gas as cheaply as
petrol if capital and alteration costs
are ignored. Extraction of benzol at
metropolitan gasworks was also con-
sidered. This is encouraged in England
to the extent of levying a special duty on
imported motor spirit. In Australia
benzol would have an advantage of six-
pence a gallon over imported petrol—the
difference between the excise and cus-
toms duties. This margin should, in
the opinion of the committee, make the
recovery of the spirit profitable at the
Mortlake, North Shore and Newcastle
(N.S.W.) gasworks, and also at West
Melbourne. These four works could pro-
duce 2,000,000 gallons of benzol annu-
ally, which would absorb 22,000 tons of
coal and employ 90 men.
The Commonwealth Government is
asking Imperial Chemical Industries to
interest itself in Newnes, and has pro-
mised “financial and other” assistance.

The percentage of trade-unionists un-
employed throughout Australia during
the June quarter was 20.9,
compared with 21.9 p.c. three
months earlier. Two years ago
the figure was 30 p.c. Queens-
land stands out with 12.7 p.c.;
South Aus. shows 25.4 p.c.,
and the Ma State 25 p.c. Vic-
toria has reduced its figure to
18 p.c. The Speck, with 17.9
p.c., has shown little improve-
ment lately owing to slackness
in the jam and fruit-preserving
trades.
* *
Out of each thousand mem-
bers registered, employment
has been found for various
unions’ members since 1932 on
the following scale: Misceb
laneous manufacturing, 183;
building, 139; clothing, hats,
etc., 101 ; engineering and
metal-working, 97; furniture,
85; and land transport, 85.
The aggregate building activity
in the six capital cities during
the first quarter of 1931 was
£1,014,709; during the same
period of 1934 it was
£2,854,286.
The concessions granted to
overseas vessels plying between
Tasmania and the mainland are to be
made permanent. Inter-State shipping
cos. are not expected to kick very hard.
Many tourists travel one way by over-
seas liners and return by Australian
steamers.

“Kali”: Thought our pint of milk
looked short; I measured it, and found
it a quarter-pint shy. The milkman
assured me he had given me full
measure ; but I put a marked graduated
billy out that evening. Three morn-
ings later the billy was found on the con-
crete path battered and useless. “A cat,”
the milkman said. I bought another can
and told Milk-oh that the cat would have
to be careful or I’d get another milkman.
That’s five weeks ago ; the cat hasn’t re-
turned, and 1 always get my full pint of
liquid, but whether it’s milk or not I
wouldn’t swear.

jugglery in which the quickness of the
mind disarms the hardened critic. Few
women could make so much of their
material.
In this case it is “Mother of Pearl,” a
play adapted from the German of Alfred
Grunwald by A. P. Herbert, with music
by Oscar Straus, admirably produced by
Frank Harvey, with striking modernistic
scenery by W. R. Coleman. The piece,
in which there are references to D. H.
Lawrence and Aldous Huxley, has, more
plot than is customary in such enter-
prises. The leading lady is the mother of
an illegitimate daughter (Phyllis Glen)
whose father (Frank Harvey) is a Cabinet
Minister, so it also comes under the
category of “sophisticated.” There are
no Melbas or Brownlees among the prin-
cipals, but Delysia performs some comic
scale gymnastics which are a parody of
Toti dal Monte and were taken seriously
by some of the first-night audience. Mr.
Harvey is a dignified Home Secretary
with a past, George Blunt is an amiable
old pot, Cecil Scott is a wooden hero,
Ron Whelan acts astutely as a waiter,
Campbell Copelin is excellent as a titled
journalist and the imported Robert
Coote provides some excellent comedy,
with Ralph Lynn overtones. Phyllis
Glen* the heroine, from Bendigo, dances
delightfully, and should be heard from
frequently if her voice breaks and she
buys another. The show has its dull
spots and lasts till 11.40, but Delysia’s
final appearance is well worth missing
one’s last tram for.

The Zelman Memorial Symphony
Orchestra and the Malvern Choral
Society, under Herbert Davis’s baton,
struggled manfully with Beethoven’s
gigantic Choral Symphony at Melb. Town
Hall on Saturday, but speedily got into
a sea of difficulties. After clawing off
the reefs and shoals of the first move-
ment, the ship sprang a leak in the
French horn department in the second,
and by the middle of the third these
instruments were almost completely
waterlogged. A fair passage was made
through the initial stages of the final
section, but when the “Hymn to Joy”
arrived the previous battle with the ele-
ments had left the crew with little of
the necessary spirit of jubilation. The
“Karelia Suite” of Sibelius was better
managed, and a setting by Elgar to Adam
Lindsay Gordon’s “The Swimmer” re-
ceived friendly treatment.

Tenor Percy Bates, who hasn’t been
heard on the Sydney concert platform
for quite a while, unleashed his fine voice
at the King’s Hall on a recent evening,
and declaimed “Lend Me Your Aid”
and “Rienzi’s Prayer,” together with lays
of less formidable status, with all his
old-time artistry. The singer, who
studied under Charles Santley and Henry
Wood, was supported by violinist Lloyd
Davies. Margaret Chalmers played
accompaniments.

Adelaide Royal is about to make a firm
effort to put itself on the map again,
manager Rendall says. It is beginning
with “The Dubarry,” for which John
Tait and Claude Kingston are present;
and Delysia, at a municipal reception on
her way east, declared that she must
return professionally. Philip Hargrave
appeals to a wider public than before
with a matinee at the once-popular
Exhibition Building. At the Tivoli a
clever crowd keep low-price revue going ;
Le Blanc, George Ward and Nat Hanley
are the chief fun-makers at the moment.

Though the Fuller selections for the
grand-opera season to open in Mel-
bourne in September are not of first-
class quality, they make a workmanlike
assortment. Maurice Deabravaneo, the
first conductor, is at present in charge
of the Paris opera. Curt Prerauer, to be
second in command, was trained by Dr.
Leo Blech, a conductor at the Berlin
State Opera House. Producer Charles
Moore and his assistant, Harold Barrett,
hail from Covent Garden. Soprano
Thea Phillips has sung at the same place.
Francesca Duret, the coloratura soprano,
is known to fame, and the tenors include
the Australian Browning Mummery and
the Belgian Octave Dua. Booth Hitchen
is among the baritones.
The Palette.
The - exhibition of the work of Aus-
tralian women painters at the Education
Department’s Gallery makes a primary
impression of cheeriness and brightness ;
when the hand that rocks the cradle
picks up brush and palette it does so joy-
fully. Flower pieces and other still-life
studies make up nearly half the exhibits.
Mostly these are impeccable in drawing
and in brush technique, and where there
are essays in post-impressionism the style
of leading French exponents is imitated
most faithfully. Among still-lifes of out-
standing merit are those of Marjorie
McChesney, Sybil Craig, Ethel M.
Nicholls (she has painted by firelight,
and the result is charming) and Nora
Heysen. The portrait studies of “Frank
Payne,” Florence Rodway and Dora L.
Wilson are notable, and Hilda Rix
Nicholas shows a forceful figure study,
“The Shepherd of Knockalong.” Mar-
garet Pestell’s “Lights of Melbourne,”
M. Glover Fleay’s water-color, “Entrance
to the Zoo,” and Jessie Trail’s “Tumut
Poplars,” together with the urban
sketches by Phyllis Shillito and J. Bruce,
are among the most attractive of the
landscapes, and a word of praise must
be spared for the dainty lino.-cuts of
Ethleen Palmer. Maude Sherwood is
represented by three pictures previously
shown in Sydney ; they look a lot bolder
in a mixed collection.
Ballarat Gallery is considering the
picture-circulating idea. One of its coun-
cillors reports that it is working success-
fully in Buffalo (U.S.A.) and Bourne-
mouth (Eng.), also in Germany. He
needn’t have inquired further than a
private gallery in Melbourne, which has
been issuing pictures like books for over
a year.
Marjorie K. Smyth’s paintings at the
Grosvenor Galleries, Sydney, are impres-
sionist, but not pretentiously or offen-
sively so. The drawing is good ; the color
schemes are well balanced but rather
dingy. Outstanding merit of the work is
that in nine cases out of ten it does cap-
ture the spirit of the subject. “Darling-
hurst,” a kerbside study, is Darlinghurst;
it couldn’t be anywhere else in the world.
“Waratah Street” is calculated to bring
acute nostalgia to any exile who knows
the region round Rushcutter Bay. “The
Slips” is another waterside piece that
positively smells of Sydney. The painter
is less successful with such cosmopolitan
things as flowers and fruit, but even here
she discovers something essential and
distinctive.
“Cauboy”: J.C.W.’s propagandist,
writing of the new His Majesty’s which is
arising out of the ashes of the old in
Melbourne, announces that in the scheme
of decoration “there are no garish effects
in which Cupids, masks and faces, and
gold paint strike the eye ; everything is
restful and artistic and in perfect har-
mony.” But I don’t know why Cupids,
masks and faces are inevitably “inartis-
tic.” Figures and faces have been used
to decorate some not unimportant edi-
fices, from the Parthenon down to the
Shrine of Remembrance in the Domain.
If the writer had said that “the delicate
coloring, beautiful panelling and tex-
tured walls” were in the latest fashion
he would have come nearer the truth.
The almost pathological horror most
modern architects have for anthropolo-
gical motives appears to me to be charac-
teristic of the art of a devitalised indus-
trial age. The modern businessman goes
about in clothes that might be described
as restful, artistic and in perfect harmony,
consisting as they do of two sets of small
drainpipes and one large one. He works
in a building or a factory composed of
packing-cases carried out in steel and
covered in concrete. The architects of
theatres, as a rule, follow the prevailing
mode, so that His Majesty’s, as far as it
can be seen through the maze of scaffold-
ing, looks like nothing so much as a
business building gone a little bit naughty.
The Cupids of our grandfathers were
pretty awful stuff, but they were human.
$ i[i *
“L. Luvus”: The latest threat to the
theatrical profession is the G.K.P. sys-
tem. It is alleged to make the revolving
stage obsolete, and it certainly makes the
scene-painter and stage-hand largely
superfluous. It is simply an improvement
on the magic lantern which throws pic- .
tures on the stage, giving an unusual effect [
of depth, and forests and lakes can be
changed to house interiors by a single
operator. Max Reinhardt recently re-
moved a revolving stage in Vienna and
installed a cyclorama, which provides the
white background on which the biograph
plays its scenic variations. A foretaste of
the system was supplied in Melbourne by
the university students who staged Elmer
Rice’s “The Adding Machine” at the
Princess. It was not only employed to
provide backgrounds, but interspersed
moving pictures of trains, tempests,
oceans and other natural phenomena.
The only drawback was that nature suf-
fered from waves in accordance with
Einstein’s theory, owing to the draughts
that rage perpetually inside proscenium
arches. The complete equipment is to be
used by entrepreneur Harry Thurston
for the Melbourne centenary revels in
September.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
The Threat to Pearling
The fortunes once made at pearling,
particularly in North Westralia, are now
a distant dream. Low prices and high
taxes have prevailed for many trying
years. Now the existence of the industry
is threatened—except perhaps in the
neighborhood of Broome —by the com-
petition of aliens without Australian
licenses and with no Australian base.
The pearlers are not worried about the
trochus-poaching side of the question.
Trochus-shelling is a small man’s job, and
is carried on south of Thursday Island.
But, like the trochus-shellers, they are in
the dark as to whether some of the
northern shell-beds are in Australian
waters or not, and the authorities seem
in no hurry to assist them.
N.Q. and N.T. shellers, with their over-
head of license fees and taxation, are
working at a heavy disadvantage against
Japanese, who pay neither. Unless some
relief comes soon, it is more than likely
that some of the Australian shellers will
follow the Jap example, and, from a
base in extra-territorial waters, fish the
banks without fee or taxation.
“Bulamakau”: Not only Queens-
landers, but many a man who served
overseas with Australian forces in South
Africa and the Great War, to say nothing
of those scattered up and down the
Western Pacific, will regret to hear that,
after 40 years of good service, the
Queensland Meat Export Co. works at
Brisbane are up for sale. The reason
given is that there are not enough good
cattle coming forward for export at pay-
able prices in view of the slump in frozen
meat in Britain. The works form a com-
plete canning and frozen-meat treatment
unit. For many years the quality and
variety of the tinned goods turned out were
unrivalled, and in the islands the demand
for them was solid. In South Africa
none of the much-boomed American
tinned meats could compare with the
Queensland produce. Imperial and
“colonial” quartermasters alike went
baldheaded for the Q.M.E. brand when
drawing supplies.
* * * *
“Coif”: Queensland’s Justice Brennan
has started another argument. Sitting in
Bankruptcy lately on applications for a
sequestration order against a publican,
’Sonah held forth about merchants who
were not particular how they got their
pound of flesh. He asked whether mer-
chants never committed breaches of
faith, and mentioned “tariff evasion.’
Sydney’s “Good Ole Piddo” would have
had to go at his top to beat Mr.
Brennan’s performance.
* * * *
“Snifter”: Percy Pease, Queensland’s
Deputy Premier, who has been lime-
lighting round the State while his boss is
away, was stuck up at Innisfail the other
day by an indignant deputation. The
complaint was that, though power alcohol
is manufactured only in N.Q., no one
up that way ever uses it to drive car or
lorry, though there is a considerable sale
for it. Pease expressed himself as
gravelled by the situation. If he had the
courage to go on a whisky-sampling tour
it might engender dark suspicions as to
where the p.a. goes.
* * * *
“N’lmporte”: Hundreds of blocks of
Helidon sandstone are on the site of the
new women’s hospital in Brisbane, while,
just below them, is the excavation work
for the building. The material from the
excavation is beautiful pink porphyry,
which is being used for filling in or
dumped. Nommensen, a local technical
chemist, says it is a horrible waste of
good material. Of such porphyry several
Brisbane churches have been built, in-
cluding St. John’s and St. Stephen’s
Cathedrals. It has also been used suc-
cessfully for the lower walls of Holy
Name Cathedral.
* * * *
“Sogeri”: Papua seems to be sur-
rendering to the delights of civilisation.
Places like Port Moresby—rather, the
big native villages near by—enjoy their
own municipal councils, with aldermen
complete, and now Hubert Murray is
talking of handing over authority in petty
administration and minor native cases
to Papuans. It is really a reversion to
primitive custom. The aldermen, ad-
ministrators and judicial authorities in
the old days were magicians, who levied
rates, laid down the law and passed sen-
tence without their authority being ques-
tioned. Even in Moresby itself these
wonder-workers are still the ultimate
authority in the hearts of the people. The
addition of a horde of civil servants to
the already powerful ranks of the pourri-
pourri men will probably mean that the
ordinary sooty civilian will have to pay
twice.

“Megass”: “J.H.” (B. 4/7/’34) reminds
me. 1 attended Tully’s 1928 “sign-on.”
The A.W.U. organiser was horrified to
find that 49 alien-born workers had been
admitted to gangs. A Finn was expelled ;
he had been naturalised for 17 years, had
served with the A.I.F. for four years,
and his wife and children were Austra-
lian-born. I felt the rank and file to be
sympathetic, but union officialdom was
inexorable.

“B.”: That a prophet is without honor
in his own country is seen in a Brisbane
“Courier-Mail” report of the Canberra
proposal to change the name of the Oxley
electorate. Brisbane’s leading daily says
the new name will be “Griffiths” in
memory of the first Chief Justice of the
High Court. One would have thought
that a journal of the “C.-M.’s” preten-
sions would have known the proper*
name of the man who was Queens-
land Premier, Leader of the Opposition
and Attorney-General, and, when his
Parliamentary days were left behind,
Chief Justice.

“Ela”: Port Moresby has had yet
another case of an assault on a white
woman by a native. In Papua these crimes
are practically confined to “Port,” and
they only began to be heard of about
20 years ago. The Papuan in his pre-
Christianised days was amoral from child-
hood until marriage, when —for women
at least —a regular life was enjoined.
“How’s biz, Joe?”
“Very dead.”
Missionary influence overrode the cus-
tol™ of a thousand years. The old paga
polygamist was forced to confine him-
self to one wife ; for the single folk
absolute continence was prescribed. It
is from the generation trained in these
teachings that sex criminals are corn-
ing. Gaol and, in one instance, the gal-
lows checked the epidemic for a while ;
but evidently it is still a danger,

cases such as this have to- be finally
approved by the Home Secretary the
took p i ace man y years ago. The
incident recalls a British New Guinea
case which had some unusual features.
A white man, an ex-Government official,
found himself forced by missionary in-
fluence to marry his concubine. The lady
proved faithless and was divorced,
Her ex-lord married another dusky lady,
When history repeated itself, the hero
found himself debarred from further
divorce by a special ordinance. Having
provided maintenance, as the law de-
manded, the husband left the country.
Years later I read of his death —sup-
posedly by his own hand —in a Japanese
dive in Singapore, a fate which, as the
Moslems have it, was written on his fore-
head at the beginning.

“Onambatutu”: Model-boat sailing
(B. 11/7/’34) seems to have been a fad
with the Papuans long before the white
man came, though in my experience
only those tribes familiar with sailing
craft indulged in it. When I first saw
it at a Northern Division river station
it was a favorite Sunday afternoon
diversion with those of the native con-
stabulary who hailed from sailing dis-
tricts ; those from inland areas, or from
localities where the paddle only was
used for canoe propulsion, were content
to look on. The big pool in Tamata
Creek opposite the old station was the
convincing ground. The body of the
canoe was usually fashioned from a
banana spathe, with an outrigger of the
same material, supported by a single
attachment instead of the twin poles
used in genuine canoes. Rigged with
scraps of calico these queer little con-
traptions got up, amazing bursts of speed
in a slight breeze, and were very attrac-
tive to watch.

Forgan Smith is supposed to have been
negotiating for the appointment of a
native-born Governor of Queensland
when Sir Leslie Wilson’s time is up.
The name of Blair, C.J., has been men-
tioned. He is Lieut.-Gov. at present,
and his translation to Olympus would
mean a vacancy for another McCawley,
if there is one in sight. Many who
would approve of a Queensland-born
Governor have their doubts on that
point.

Eve Douglas, the pretty daughter of Jus-

experience returning from a dance. A car

lision threw Eve out into the road, and for a
fortnight or so she has been in the Mater
Hospital, still bruised and shaken.

the brains, of their parents. Both children
passed their “senior” with honors, and Cecily
is now taking a science course. Marjorie is
a good pianist; Cecily coaxes music from the
violin and has a sweet voice.
Vanity must be the last passion to die out
of the human breast. A businessman, very
old and ugly, can’t meet a pretty girl without
trying on her the old “Where 'nave I met

dinner. He made a sad mistake the other day.

At the dance held by Brisbane Grammar Old
Boys a canopy of dark- and light-blue

with a large party of guests.

Five cheery girleens have gone south by
car. Maureen Ahern was at the wheel, and
other owners of the luggage strapped on be-

Peggy Chauncey, the pretty and clever girl
who was one of Pavlova’s company for a
time, is giving lessons in deportment to
debs. It is very smart of Peggy, but if a girl
is fit to come out one may surely take it for
granted that she will not drink from a bottle
or use her knife as a scoop for peas. Still,
one never knows; and it is as well to be on
the safe side. A certain amount of coaching in
the manipulation of a train is necessary. No
one wants to make a cocoon of oneself when
curtsying to vice-royalty.
The Governor of Victoria and Lady Hunt-

They are to stay with our Sir Leslie at Govern-

Eileen, the Isaac Moores’ daughter, is having
a lovely time in the Cold Country paying
a round of visits. She has been staying with
Major and Mrs. Fry at Hamble, Hants, and,
after looking in on the first Test match, went
to Sussex to stay at Westbrook Hall—the
original one, after which the old home of the
Beits in Toowoomba was named. The Ward-
laws live at Westbrook Hall.
Lots of Brisbane’s pretty girls are over the
other side at present. Mary Luya becomes
almost lyrical when she writes of the charm
of the English countryside; Cecile Walsh and
Jan McDowall have scampered over a good
deal of England, and when the last mails
left were packing for Paris. Mary is coming
back to Queensland in time to eat her Christ-
mas dinner.
The committee of the United Service Ball
closed down on debs, when the number
reached 37. The nominations list for guests
also has been closed with a snap.
The Lockyer lady has arrived from Mel-
bourne, and will spend some months in Bris-
bane as the guest of her son and daughter-in-
law, Mrs. and Mrs. N. W. Lockyer, at In-

The Girl Guide Ball, to happen in Show
Week, is to be something extra-special. The
Macartney lady is president of the committee,
and Mrs. Lance Jones and Mrs. C. L. Harden
are looking after the decorations, which are
to be unusual. Mrs. Chris Dixon is the hon.
treasurer; Nan Edwards the hon. secretary.
Mesdames J. S. Robertson and W. Ear-
waker are looking after the publicity work, and
doing it as well as any hardened traveller of
the Inky Way. _
Berenice Montgomery, with a
floppy spotted bow at the neck
and a curate’s hat —at least, it
looked like one —worn slightly
over one eye, is home again, after
two years in London studying
music. Berenice has a wistful
expression, which is belied by the
delightful little quirks at the cor-
ners of her mouth. She will be
an asset to Brisbane’s musical
world. In England she played to
Prince George and the King of
Greece, appeared in the Queen’s
Hall with a full orchestra and
gave numerous recitals. And
Berenice was presented at Court.
After that experience came the
greatest thrill of all. The Duchess
of Rutland wrote to her and
said she would like to paint a portrait of the
young Queenslander —which she did in her
own garden.
A new engagement is that of Peggy Warren,
daughter of the Warrens of Bingara station, to
Peter Blundell, only son of P. A. Blundell,
for many years manager of the Queensland
Trustees. Peter is growing fruit in the Stan-
thorpe district. His mother was the eldest
daughter of thh late T. M. King, once Com-
missioner for Railways, and Peter has inherited
the good looks for which the Kings and his
maternal ancestors, the McDonnells, were
noted.
Neaera Sampson’s wedding to Charles
Bassett —it’s to happen to-day—is to be very
quiet. Only the few guests have been in-
formed as to the hour it will take place. The
lady also declined all the bride teas which her
friends were anxious to give for her. For a
thoroughly modern lass, Neaera has an o'd
fashioned streak. She actually thinks a
wedding should be just an intimate family
affair. Part of the ’moon will be spent in
the Harbor City, but a trip to Europe has
been arranged. ,
Captain and Mrs. E. R. B. Pike have cele-
brated their silver wedding. He is secretary ot
the Queen?land Ambulance Transport Brigade,

Grammar School is to produce A. A. Milne’s
play “To Have the Honor’ on July 20.
Kathleen Radford is the producer.

of California —mamma was Gladys Markwell,
a sister of Dr. Norman Markwell, of Brisbane,
and a granddaughter of that grand old lady
Mrs. Bond, whose husband was one ot the
founders of Perry Bros. —has arrived in Bus-
bane for a holiday. She is staying with her
mother’s mother, Mrs. Walter Markwell. The
Drakes are almost in the millionaire class in
America. They have several lovely homes, in-
cluding one which looks like a transplanted
English castle of the fifteenth century.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The intimacy that comes from drawn
curtains and glowing fires made pleasant
the party given at Government House by
Acting-Governor Street and his wife on
Friday. There were the hostess’s tur-
quoise embossed velvets and bowls of
red camellias and greenery to gladden
the eye. Elsa Corry’s and Clement
Williams’s singing and Trixie Tange at
the piano enchanted the ear, to say
nothing of accompanists Muriel Edsall
and Enid Conley.
The dressing was elaborate. The
Murray lady, who had just arrived from
Canberra in time for dinner, revealed
red-and-white chevron stripes under a
golden sequin coat. Mrs. T. H. Kelly’s
ivory satins were topped with a rose-pink
cape of ostrich feathers. These hung
lengthwise from a yoke of chiffon, and
had their ends knotted to form a spread-
ing fluffiness about the waist. White
coque feathers frothed round Mrs.
Walter Swinson’s shoulders. Mrs. Kenneth
Street brought two young daughters,
Bettina and Phillipa; Mollie Street
had a kilting of black and another of
pink to liven up the neckline and form
the sleeves of her black tulle frock. Miss
Edith Poolman, the Street lady’s sister,
wore primrose brocade. Archbishop
Mowll and his wife, Muriel Fletcher,
the knightly Bavins, Sadie and Elise
Budge, and Ann Gordon, Mrs. Geoffrey
Hughes, Lady Poynter and Dame Eadith
Walker were others who applauded the
musicians and later contributed to the
babel of sound that echoed through the
rooms.
Crowds gathered outside David Jones’s
to see the dancers arrive for the “Collits’
Inn” Ball, and there was great laughter
when four Sairey Gamps stepped out of
a taxi. These were nurses from Crown-
street Women’s Hospital, beneficiary of
the ball. Inside there were much curtsying
and flirting of fans, especially among
Mrs. T. H. Kelly’s Belles and Beaux set.
Most of the girls wore spreading skirts of
organdie, and their hair was in ringlets.
Jocelyn Poynter, Ann Gordon and Eliza-
beth Knox were in this group, and were
attractive in their off-the-shoulder dresses.
Mrs. Tom Kelly looked as though she
were ready to start off on a coach jour-
ney with her long green coat and poke
bonnet edged with fur. In the parade
Bertie Kelly walked with Mrs. Worthing-
ton Simon. Mrs. T. H. Kelly was the
Duchess of Florence in Venetian-red
velvets and some really lovely lace.
In the “Collits’ Inn” set were many
who had taken part in the original pro-
duction. T. S. Gurr came as Governor
Darling ; his wife as Mistress Dale. Peter
Lindsay was a young settler. Ambrose
Bourke got into his Captain Lake uniform,
and his wife was a charming Mary Collits.
Sparkling-eyed Tina Bentivoglio, in
spreading white taffetas, led the Italian
set. Her followers wore mediaeval dresses
of velvet and satin and picturesque head-
dresses of the period. Their escorts were
of the military. Mrs. Claude Flemming
wore amethystine crepes and a huge
bunch of violets at her shoulder. She
and W. T. Layton were the judges. They
awarded the prize to the Music set,
which included Mrs. Cyril Monk
as Eliza Vestres. And a final fillip
was given to a night already as
heady as champagne by a hold-up of
the dancers by bushrangers, the arrest of
the highwaymen by redcoats, and a
corroboree, all of which preceded the
arrival of a radiant Gladys Moncrieff.
The French community in Sydney
celebrated the anniversary of the taking
of the Bastille by a dance at Hordern
Bros.’ This was arranged by the Alliance
Fran?aise, and to it came all the Consuls
that earlier in the day had drunk to the
Tricolor at the Consul-General’s levee.
The National Anthem greeted the Lieut.-
Governor and his lady, she in a shimmer
of silver laces, and everyone continued
to stand to attention as the stirring notes
of “The Marseillaise” rang out. French
Consul-General Dussap’s orders glit-
tered, and Mrs. Dussap’s lupin-blue
satins sprouted pink coque feathers on
the shoulder. Dr. Alfred Wunderlich
brought daughter Margaret, and Pat
Moran his mother and doctor father.
Shipping man T. S. Gordon and Mrs.
Gordon entertained the P. and O.
Rickards couple and the C. D. Con-
achers. In the Frank Wrights’ cheery
party were Gladys Marks, Dorothy
Tremlett and Margaret Hughes-Kent.
The Bertie Kellys were among the
mighty ; a ruched train wriggled in the
wake of her Parma-violet velvet coat.
Mrs. M. Brenac was another who wore
this becoming shade. Mr. and Mrs.
Pelletier (he’s president of the French
Chamber of Commerce) entertained a
large party. Mrs. Destombe’s fairness
was enhanced by a souffle of pink tulle,
and Sophie Segaert’s by leaf-green
velvets.
This is a pencil sketch of Joan
Hannam, daughter of the H. Lipscombe
IJannams, of Darling Point. Joan’s
hobbies are dancing, tennis and riding,
but at the moment Cinesound Studios
are taking up much of her time ; she has
a part in the film “Strike Me Lucky.”
The ball of the Scottish Royal Arch
Masonic Lodge filled the Town Hall
with color and movement. There were
the vivid regalia of the Masons; the
stirring music of Scotland. Thirty white-
clad debs, marched under an arch of
steel (miles long it must have seemed to
the youngsters) to where Acting-Gov-
ernor Street and his wife stood against
the fluttering red, white and blue of the
Union Jack and the yellow-and-red of
the Royal Scottish standards. The
lady’s dress of black velvet had tiny
frills; Mrs. Wilde, wife of the Grand
Superintendent, and Mrs. Harley, wife
of the hon. sec., both chose gold satin.
The Mayoral Parkers were in this
group ; she covered her burgundy laces
with a long fur coat. The Gordon lady’s
raisin-velvet wrap had a Medici collar,
and sister-in-law Mrs. Eardley Lushing-
ton's pomegranate-red chiffons added
still another splash of color.
Two full-grown Moths with wings out-
spread flanked the band dais at the Palais
Royal on the night the Aero Club held
its ball. The club’s badge, a hopping
kangaroo and miniature floral ’planes in
poinsettia and two shades of blue del-
phinium decorated every table. Vice-
pres. S. L. Tyler brought Mrs. Tyler,
who tied up her burgundy laces with
a green and parchment sash. The
Mayoral Parkers were the night’s
honored; the Geoffrey Hughes couple
hosted a big party and Cyrus McColm
and Winnie Marshall danced with as
much enthusiasm as did flying girls
Peggy McKillop, Jean Gardiner and
Nancy Bird.
The Day Nursery Association boiled
the billy in honor of Elsie Town at the
Woolloomooloo creche. In the absence
through illness of the MacCallum lady
(who is president), Mrs. W. P. McElhone
made the introductions, and education-
ist Ross Thomas slipped in for a few
words and a handshake with the stranger.
Miss Town has come to direct the de-
velopment of nursery schools. Her Rachel
MacMillan diploma testifies to her effi-
ciency, and she evinced in the short
speech she made
during the after-
noon a real love of
the work of de-
veloping the mind
of the child of pre-
school age.
The nursery
school and the day
nursery, though
under the one roof,
must not be con-
fused. The latter
takes care of the
physical well-being
of the child; the
school of its intel-
lect. Toys and
games are the
equipment used in
stimulating the
awakening senses ;
rhymes and jingles
give the kiddy
word-sense ; games,
a social sense (a
high - sounding
word, but it simply
means meeting
other children and
learning to give as
well as take).
The playroom
where the tea-
drinking took place
is practically all
windows, through
which the sun
shone joyously on
bowls of golden
poppies. The low
tables and chairs are all brightly colored,
and the pictures are hung low on the
walls so that there need be no neck-cran-
ing to see. Cupboards are chock-full of
toys. There are orthodox swings, but old
motor-tyres suspended from the ceiling
are patronised by the more daring.
Downstairs in the nurseries babies were
sleeping or playing with woolly toys, or
being dressed to be ready for father and
mother to collect on their way home
from work.
On a sunshiny afternoon last week,
Honnor Chisholm Mitchell, only daugh-
ter of the W. E. Mitchells, of Too-
wong Hill, Corryong, Upper Murray
(Vic.), became Mrs. Oliver Moreton
Lodge. All Saints’, Woollahra, saw the
vows exchanged, and “King’s” padre
C. T. Parkinson had Archdeacon Lang-
ley’s assistance in tying the knot. The
bride carried lily-of-the-valley and wore
a flower coronet of real pearls to hold
in place the billows of tulle that en-
veloped the mother-of-pearl velvet wed-
ding garment. There were two small
trainbearers. The three ’maids, Githa
Connolly, Barbara Warry and Jean
Friend, wore lily-of-the-valley in their
hair and on their muffs, which were of
the same lily-green velvet as their frocks.
The bridegroom is the elder son of the
H. Lodges, of Mont Plaisant, Mona Vale.
Toasts at the Queen’s Club.
Margaret Moor Vicars and William
John Victor Windeyer slipped into matri-
mony at the Beecroft kirk. The knot-tying
united two well-known Sydney families.
The bride, daughter of the Robert
Vicarses, of Yallambee, Cheltenham, wore
a frock of ivory lame satin. This was
enveloped in a veil of Spanish lace over
200 years old and lent by the Windeyer
family. There was also a coronet of
orange-blossom, and in the bride’s
bouquet were lily-of-the-valley and
hyacinths. Her sisters Kathleen and
Janet ’maided in sky-after-rain-blue and
silver chiffons. Subsequent rejoicings
were at the home of the bride’s parents.
Here Mrs. Vicars extended the hand of
greeting to 200 guests, her mulberry
satin coat sporting a collar of the much-
sought-after silver fox that is more silver
than black.
Two well-known N.S.W. and Q.
families were united by the marriage
of Alison Cargill and Edgar de Burgh
Joyce at St Paul’s, Carcoar. The gown
worn by the bride had been her mother’s
presentation dress. It was of magnolia
satin, and had long sleeves. There were
a Brussels lace veil, poised on many
layers of tulle, an armful of magnolias,
golden roses and lily-of-the-valley to
finish off the wedding raiment. The gold
of autumn was prisoned in the velvets
worn by the three ’maids, and in their
muffs of nasturtiums and marigolds. The
bride is the daughter of Mrs. W. D. Car-
gill and granddaughter of Mrs. Whitney,
of Coombing Park, Carcoar, where the
toasts were drunk. The bridegroom is
the only son of the Edgar Joyces, of
Beaudesert (Q.).
President of the Royal Empire Society
the Kelso King knight and his wife
extended the hand of welcome and simul-
taneously murmured your name to Rear-
Admiral and Mrs. Ford at the society’s
rooms on Thursday. The King lady’s
frock was of burgundy laces. Mrs. Ford’s
complexion glowed, and in her necklace
were stones that matched her forest-green
velvets, which flowed into frivolous gold-
lined wing sleeves. The rooms wore
poinsettias flauntingly, sweet-peas frag-
rantly, and wattle dripped a fringe of
gold balls from mantelpiece and cabinet.
London visitors Major and Mrs. D. E.
Allen were made much of. Mrs. W. H.
Mackay’s black marocains were patterned
in red flowers. Enid Riddle came with
her mother and banker father. Her long
fur coat was white, her crepe frock
Persian red. Mrs. Tom Hogan’s red
laces were worn with dangling brilliant
earrings, and the Rear-Admiral Feakeses
and the W. G. Laytons were among the
sought-after.
Every woman at the Norma Shearer
Ball glued her eyes on the mannequins
as they paraded in the dresses worn by
the film star in “Riptide,” and decided
without hesitation which would be her
choice if she should be the holder of the
lucky number. To Adelaide girl Dorothy
Stuckey fell the prize, and she selected
a gorgeous affair of black velvet with
which went a gold lame coat. Rita Fox,
the organiser of the flutter, danced in
black-and-white patterned crepes, and the
hon. sec., Mrs. J. Harris, in black crepes
with silver lame epaulettes. Gate money
goes to the Limbless Soldiers’ Assoc.
The All-Blacks will be the guests of the
committee at the mid-week Rugby
Union Ball to be held at Hordern Bros,
on July 30. Mrs. R. A. Eakin is presi-
dent of the ball, and pretty Cecily
Wheelihan the hon. sec. Proceeds go to
Furlough House.


Melbourne
Chatter
A record crowd gathered at Fleming-
ton for the last day of the Grand
National Steeplechase—a prosperous
crowd, too, worth fabulous sums for the
skins of wild beasts which kept it warm.
A strong wind swirled under hat brims,
plucked at curls which emerged from
goblin caps and mocked at the elastic
under pancake crowns. Among country
visitors were Mrs. George Landale, in
a brown caracul coat, accompanied by
navy-clad daughter Janet and Beverley
Lansell. Mrs. Lindsay Field, of Denili-
quin, pinned a sprig of daphne to her
tomato suit, with its hairline cross-stripe.
The Laurence Meynells, just arrived
from London, were there, Mrs. Meynell
renewing her acquaintance with Austra-
lian races from under a blue hat banded
with red. Mrs. Scott Morell displayed
a handsome dyed-ermine coat. The
Russell Grimwades (of Cook’s Cottage)
were together, Mrs. Grimwade in plum
velvet, pearls and a cape made from
hundreds of sable tails which reached
her knees. Margaret Beauchamp's henna
coat wore military twists upon its
shoulders, and buttons ran all the way
down the back of the skirt portion of
Mrs. lan Macdougall’s navy turnout.
The concertina sleeve still wages war
with the slimming raglan ; Betty Jour-
neaux had her shoulders reinforced by
the former. Mrs. Stewart Brunton man-
aged to keep her white hair neat; she
was with daughter Gladys. A lynx dis-
played his spots upon Aileen Lemon’s
snuff-brown coat.
Among the parties which sprang up
like mushrooms during Grand National
week the Charles Coopers’ was one of the
largest. It featured cocktails, and the
locality was Menzies’. Mrs. and Mrs.
Cooper’s permanent address is Meerut,
India, but they will be domiciled at
Melbourne Mansions until September.
The hostess wore crepe broche in a
shade of desert-sand with a page-boy
fullness to the sleeve below the elbow,
and a little blue hat which took a
rakish tilt backwards from the forehead.
Representatives from G.-H. were on the
guest list, which also included the Angus
Urquharts, the Alec Russells, Major and
Mrs. Foster Rutledge, the Colin Calverts,
the Harry Whitings, Ella Payne, Lilian
and Nancy Greene, Geoff Lempriere,
Colin Bell and a heap of Manifolds,
Chirnsides and Grimwades.
Mrs. Howard Clark and Mrs. Warren
Clark booked the date of the second
Grand National meeting for their joint
late-afternoon party. Branches of flam-
boyant poinsettia sprayed with scarlet
the reception-rooms at No. 9, where both
hostesses, each displaying a preference
for black, made their guests welcome.
Alison Clark’s navy ensemble included a
three-quarter-length coat, and Marnie
Clarke’s cinema coat of pansy-blue
velvet was worn with a halo hat.
Eileen Finlay, of Seymour, showed her
originality by plucking a posy of field
flowers to wear on her beige dress in
lieu of the popular violets or orchids.
Helen Leary and her engagement ring
(put upon her finger by Gavin Finlay)
were the centre of a knot of young
things. Mrs. Jimmie Paxton retained the
handsome fur coat and little hat adorned
with the wing of a parrot which she
had worn to the races. Noticed also in
the crowd were Mrs. Russell Barrett,
Mrs. Hoppell, from India, Captain and
Mrs. McKewan, the Alex. Camerons and
the Lindsay Mildreds.
The grand finale to Grand National
week was the first night of “Mother of
Pearl.” The foyer of the Princess buzzed
with excitement, the theatre was hung
with garlands, and white ties and long
kid gloves permeated to the second-last
row of the stalls. Delysia’s gowns are
as ravishing as her personality, and her
figure is so perfect that she can eschew
foundation garments. In ink-blue sequins
which cling like a second skin she looks
like a wet. mermaid, her “tail” being
three yards of train which is steered by
the artful kick of a high French heel.
There were changes in the audience’s
coiffures. One woman had allowed her
hair to go white but for a sweep of
black across the crown; another had
a wide, white lock brushed back from
her forehead ; there were fewer twinkly
haloes and more diamond clips and
coronets made from twists of material
to match the wearer’s dress.
Mrs. F. W. Thring was impressive in
off-white velvet. In the crowd were Hugh
Hamilton and his wife, she in ice-blue
satin; Mrs. Alan McKay, an ermine
coat over her lime-green dress; the
Secretary of Defence and Mrs. M. L.
Shepherd, handsome in black velvet;
Maggie Dickinson, in sky blue and tufts
of squirrel-tails, and Mrs. V. Stevens,
with clusters of pearl grapes in her hair.
On view also were Ambrose Pratt s
beard, Mrs. Alf Brash’s attractive white
head, the oyster-satin dress and pearl
diadem worn by Mrs. Harley Styles, and
the militant shoulders of Margaret
Nicholson’s moss-green coat.
The Alliance Franchise did its best to
work up a national feeling in the lower
Town Hall on Friday, instead of on the
following day. The dance went quietly
until midnight (for it’s difficult to get
excited over the wrong date), and then
there were toasts and cheers to celebrate
the fall of the Bastille, and Mrs. Kenneth
Stewart performed “The Marseillaise” as
a solo. Her attractive gown of black
velvet had little turn-down lapels of
pique upon its neckline, sweet-peas lay
upon her shoulder and she wore a halo
plait. M. Marcus, wearing his Legion
d’Honneur ribbon, brought his wife and
daughters to the official table for Consuls
and special guests. Mme. Cockerton
carried on her secretarial job in a gown
of periwinkle grosgrain satin. Mme.
Vanden Driche was in black. Mrs. W.
Watson wound her hair into a halo and
split her velvet dress in the fashionable
region of the spine. Frances Dillon was
all white satin and ospreys, and a
jewelled bangle twinkled outside her long
glove. Dorothy Stirling had a little velvet
cape within coo-ee of her ripply white
dress.
Jean Hunter put rosebuds in her hair,
and one slim young woman, whose ivory
gown showed a diagonal pin-tuck move-
ment, wore a lock of white hair across
her dark head. Fur is a habit with skat-
ing champion Joyce Macbeth ; her wine-
red satin was a-dangle with bunny pelts.
Ann Outhwaite had a youthful touch of
shell-pink ruched sleeve to her black
velvet, and Erica Burston was dashingly
patriotic with a scarlet cap and a blue
dress. Mrs. W. Mortill managed her mer-
maid train with grace. Betty Walker’s
black taffetas showed a hopscotch
pattern in turquoise, and Betty Shackell
was all in white.
A Broothorn camera depicts violinist
Gertrude Healy, who gave a successful
recital at the Lyceum last week. Miss
Healy played in a gown of white brocade,
the skirt sweeping after her into a train
and the corsage elaborated with a green
flower. Elsie Fraser, who supported at
the piano, wore black satin with a mesh
of lace introduced into the yoke.
The whitest head in the room belonged
to Herman Schrader, who was unknow-
ingly listening to his final concert. His
words of congratulation to the artists
were the last of such encouraging
phrases to fall from the lips of the
eminent musician. Walking along Col-
lins-street after the recital with Fritz
Hart and A. Tremearne, he collapsed
and died near the corner of Swanston-
street. Mr. Schrader was Australian-
born and studied in Germany, his special
instruments being the piano and viola.
He was a professor of music at the Con.
under Marshall Hall, a composer, and
one of the best authorities on classical
music this country has produced.
Lady Huntingfield’s appearance at
functions is not a quick visit to accept
a bouquet and a cup of tea, to listen to
a few speeches and say a few words in
reply. She likes to meet people in an
informal manner, and at the Inter-
national Club’s reception in her honor re-
mained to admire the view from the
eighth floor of Kurrajong House and,
when the crowd had thinned out, the
pictures round the room. Accompany-
ing her mother was the Hon. Sara Van-
neck in one of her favorite brown suits
and a wee eye veil. Judge Foster’s wife,
who sat among the official hostesses,
looked particularly smart in a severely
tailored black suit and silver foxes.
T. W. Bearup showed no quiver of self-
consciousness at being the only man
present. His wife was in a beige coat
collared with cocoa fur. Mrs. M. J.
Canny in a draped navy blue coat and
stone-marten furs sat with Mrs. Frank
Faithful, who was in black. Madame
Matis (she was desolated because the
“char.” polished under the rugs and an
ankle injury prevented her missing the
Alliance Frangaise ball for the first time
in years), a Norwegian, Mrs. Thorvald-
son, and a Danish member, Mrs’. A. Pratt,
chatted in several languages. Mrs. J.
Don brought her very fair daughter Mrs.
J. Merlo.
Bae Kimpton was a while-and-gold
vision at her farewell dance. Her satin
gown was lightly sprayed with gold
sequins, the heaviest fall being in the
region of a front panel and the hemline.
Shoulder straps and sash were of gold
lame. The hostess’s sister, Mrs. Aubrey
Gibson, was also clad in while with a
transparent excuse of tulle cape over her
shoulders. The Kimpton home, Mirra-
dor, had its spacious interior filled with
gladioli and japonica, while striped
canvas blinds kept the chill night air
from the verandah. Among the dancers
were the James Cook, Norman Gubbins
and Tom Luxton couples, Dorothy
Rogers, Leila Burgess, Louise Moran,
Edna Carr, Rod Andrew, Peter Lem-
priere, Rex and Vivian Ebbott. Miss
Kimpton, who leaves for Europe next
week with the Aubrey Gibsons, will be
back with her trousseau at the end of
the year.
Pictured here by Broothorn is Dr.
Alva Boyd, who has lately returned to
Melbourne after a holiday abroad. She
encountered vagaries of climate in
her travels ; in the West Indies, where
her arrival and departure sand-
wiched the pitter-patter of revolutionary
bullets, she experienced a taste of heat
and humidity; in Scotland she had
several months of bracing winter. Dr.
Boyd’s only sister, Mrs. Angus Robertson
(tennis champion Esna Boyd that was),
lives at Dunfermline, half an hour’s train
journey from Edinburgh. She has a small
son and daughter and is rapidly lowering
her handicap at golf. J. A. Boyd accom-
panied his medico daughter on the earlier
stages of her trip.
Pleasant times in the West:
Legal lights doffed their wigs and gowns
for the Perth law students’ dance. The M. G.
Lavans and the J. L. Walkers were there; also
W. E. B. Solomon and his better half, she in
black Chantillies and velvet, and Mrs. F. P.
O’Dea, with a woodland scene on her chiffons.
The lion of the L.A.B. Club gathering was
Frederick Moore, R.A.M., L.C.M., whose
roarings some 200 members rallied to hear.
President Mrs. C. L. Mason, draped with
petunia velvet, directed the traffic to the wild-
flower-decked hall, which reverberated to a.
musical programme, including Mr. Moore’s
renderings of Chopin and his own composi-
tions.
Eila Vincent made her bow to society over
a posy of rosebuds held against trained creamy
velvet with sloped cape and jewelled motif
catching the side-bow. Mrs. Vincent s jet
corsage glittered against black georgette as
she received the stream of guests and piloted
them to the ballroom, where soft lights re-
flected the glow of dull gold curtains and the
rich paintings on the walls. Daphne Vincent
trailed silver lame aglow with diamente.
The anniversary celebration of the Repertory
Club’s tenancy of its own theatre was more
social than histrionic. Members overflowed
into the lounge, where a huge birthday cake
held pride of place. The programme was a
riotous affair of humorous sketches, tavern
songs burlesque ballets and community sing-
ing ’ Vice-pres. Bickford, with his black-
«eorgette-clad helpmeet, and chairman Miller,
with Mrs. Miller in navy blue chiffons, egged
on the songsters
The Pleiades Club went gold and brown for
its ball, with dancers wending their way be-
tween masses of wattle in the ballroom. Mrs.
G S Norton’s blue matelasse and silver lame
occupied the committee’s chair, with Beryl
Birchley, Alice Biggs, Biddie Dodd, Zoe Ben-
nett and Joyce Colliver as members of the
6 of the 200 Club festooned the
Masonic Hall, Subiaco with myriads of
streamers, gold and black, the club colors,
predominating. Gwenda Cribb’s empire-frilled
organdies were in the box seat for the even-
ing; Rita Dunstan spattered gold sequins on
green pebble crepe; Lorraine Godden warmed
moss-green lace with beige fur; Pixie Pretty’s
crimson satin was self-embossed; Dulcie Angel
hailed coin spots on white organdie; and Zoe
Weir set off her flaxen hair with scarlet mate-
lasse.
Brass buttons, red stripes and scarlet uniforms
stood to attention at the Drill Hall when the
Lud Mayor opened the P. 8.1. military ball.
Colored lights rivalled the decorations on manly
chests, and the regimental band burst forth
into dance-making music. Mrs. E. B. Sin-
clair’s blue and silver stripes were in keeping
with the atmosphere; Brigadier Martyn’s lady
spun a web of black lace; Mrs. Baxter Cox
fixed field flowers to black georgette; Jane
Shann was a flickering flame of velvet; Gwen
Lewis’s colorful garden grew in taffeta; and
Mrs. B. Garner augured an early spring in
apple-leaf blister crepe.
Tassie’s social chronicles:
The Tasmanian Club overflowed with oysters
and cocktails on the occasion of its evening
party. Red baize ran from kerbstone to in-
terior. His Ex. and Lady Clark were received
by president knight Elliott Lewis and his lady,
and vice-president C. T. Butler and Mrs.
Butler. There was dancing in the dining-room,
and other rooms were devoted to cards and
other games. The supper-tables were fragrant
with spring flowers.
Collegiate School Old Girls ran a jolly dance
at the Continental at the beginning of the
winter holidays. The school colors, red and
white, were a good basis for the decorations,
and figured in the little floral haloes worn by
members of the committee. Lady Clark smiled
on the show in black satin. Nora Perkins was
hon. sec.
Mayoress Wignall’s afternoon party at the
Town Hall in the interests of the D.N.A. was
well attended, and the long table provided
to hold contributions to the comforts of the
sick poor was heaped with parcels in no time.
Mrs. Wignall and Mrs. E. H. Webster (presi-
dent of the D.N.A.) received the guests. Music
and tea passed the time pleasantly.
The old Anglican church at Hamilton, the
foundation-stone of which was laid by Governor
Arthur, celebrated the hundredth anniversary
of that occasion. Bishop Hay was there, and
a new stained window was installed. Trees
were planted in the church grounds and in the
township, a much-needed addition to that tree-
less locality.
The Lyceum Club has broken new ground
by holding a play-writing competition. Mrs.
Southey Brammall’s playlet “N 9. 9 Lilac St.’
won the prize, offerings by Miss Lane (Vic.)
and Miss Jameson running close up.
Mrs. Minette Lucas is off to England to
put her two little lads to school. The Ashbolt
lady gave her a farewell bridge party at
Leuna, Battery Point. The supper-table was
decked with pink camellias, and pink candles
under shades of the same color were set m
tall silver candelabra.
Mrs. C. E. Davies and her daughter Ciceley,
who have been on the mainland for some
weeks, have taken Mrs. Minette Lucas’s house,
Wrest Point, for the term of its owner’s
absence in England.
Adelaide’s social frolics:
At the Hunt Club races Mr. and Mrs. H.
Young presided, and the crowd for tea was so
great that the adjoining room had to be brought
into use. Mrs. Irvine Wald, the pretty wife
of the club secretary, was presented with the
Drag Cup, won for her by Quindoo. She
wore a silver musquash fur coat over a pale-
grey tailored suit, and a small grey hat to
match.
Several recent brides were at the races.
Mrs. Lawrence Hayward was in a smart navy-
blue coat with big collar of opossum fur, and
small hat to tone. Mrs. Gilbert Jose chose a
deep delphinium blue for her coat, with a posy
of lilies-of-the-valley pinned on her grey lox-
fur collar, and a blue toque. Black has quite
faded out, and everyone was in green, brown,
blue or grey. Mrs. H. Young favored a navy
ensemble and hat; her daughter Nora wore
brown tweed and a wide-brimmed brown felt
hat. Mrs. Barton Forster sported an attractive
pale-blue woollen suit and a little hat to match.
Mrs. George Braund’s brown tailored coat had
a brown fox collar.
Over 300 guests thronged the Uni. refectory
for the Science Association’s Ball. Bowls of
bright mixed flowers decorated the supper-
table, and the refectory was hung with
humorous posters, skits on the various sciences.
The guests were received by Prof. A. K. Mac-
beth (patron) and his wife. Mrs. Macbeth’s
flame georgette was background for a posy of
roses and sweet-peas presented to her by the
committee. The prof, brought his wireless set
so as not to miss the cricket. ■
The Commercial Travellers’ Club’s charity
ball at the Palais Royal attracted 400 couples.
W. H. Morton (president) and Mrs. Morton,
with A. L. Berry (vice-president) and Mrs.
Berry, received the official guests. Mrs. Morton
wore black chiffon velvet, and Mrs. Berry was
in black ninon banded with black satin.
The Rover Ball, also at the Palais, gathered
in another 800. The boys had made all the
paper caps on a stall served by a bevy of
pretty girls. Henry Rymill was one of those
who brought a large party. He is greatly
interested in the Scouts.
The Gunners’ Ball at the Embassy was gar-
nished with field artillery, piled swords, lance
pennants and flags, with most of the male
guests in uniform. Lud Mayor Cain and his
daughter, Mrs. H. Dunstan (acting Mayoress),
were received with a prodigious fanfare.
Buglers announced the start and finish of every
dance. Lieut.-Col. C. W. Coombe and his
wife received the guests, she in black chiffon
velvet. The D.N.0., Commander S. R.
Symonds, and his wife were welcomed with
military honors. Mrs. Symonds sported
pervenche-blue lace. Many dinner-parties pre-
ceded the dance. _
At the Memorial Hall, St. Peter s College,
there was a dance in aid of St. Peter s College
Mission Bridge was played in the headmaster s
Quarters. Opportunity was taken to welcome
the new headmaster, the Rev. Guy Pentreath,
and his wife, who received the guests in con-
junction with Mrs. K. Cameron Wilson and
Neste Gwynne. Mrs Pentreath chose white
satin cut on princess lines. Mrs. K C. Wl-
- sky-blue satin had a fine gold stripe on
diagonal lines, and she flashed a silver halo.
Mrs. Gwynne did her secretarial chores in
white flowered chiffon. Bronte Wiltshire, the
solitary deb., made her curtsy in cream pique
velvet with a cape from the shoulders, and
carried a posy of pink roses.

THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
Still Single
In “War Pensioners First” (B. 11/7/’34)
no mention was made of pensioned
Diggers who are single but don’t want
to remain in that state. If they were to
marry the wife would not enjoy part
pension: this was stopped in 1931. In
justice all should be on the same foot-
ing. Some Diggers on pension since
1919—the same pension—are only now in
a position to marry.—A. Laurence
(N.S.W.).
“A Bill of Rights for Australians”
That truthful leading article (B.
4/7/’34) takes me back to the time the
Commonwealth was voted into existence.
I then drew up a Charter of Liberties.
It progresses slowly, because no politi-
cian and no newspaper has hitherto put a
signature to it. —A. R. Ward (N.S.W.).
“In a Nutshell”
I should like to congratulate you on
the splendid article that appeared in B.
16/5/’34, entitled “The Diggers’ Land-
lord.” It deals in a nutshell with the
troubles we are experiencing in Tas-
mania, and was very aptly put.
I am sending a copy of a case
prepared on behalf of war-
service homes’ purchasers
which we are submitting to the
Government. —A. A. Orchard,
secretary, Hobart sub-branch
R.S.S.I.L.
Zapata
In B. 4/7/’34 there appeared
a further criticism on Zapata
which seems to me to be based
on “what a friend of mine told
a friend of mine who told
me.” “Second Divvy’s” friend
was certainly badly informed
or he did not know what he
was talking about—Zapata and
Villa never operated together.
The only time they met was in
Mexico City while the city
was occupied by the revolu-
tionary forces. Besides that,
they were a long distance from
one another and Villa had
nothing in common with the
ideas of Zapata.—C. Zalapa,
Consul for Mexico in Australia
and N.Z.
Killing No Murder
The old verdict of “Good
enough for the cow!” long
popular in Australia though
not mentioned in the law-
books, has received another
endorsement in Adelaide.
These cases seem to run almost
by formula. There was the
usual cross-grained father,
making home a hell for his
family ; the usual threat to do
them all in ; the usual young
son grabbing the domestic
shotgun to prevent his getting
and perhaps using it —and the
usual dad dead on the floor.
At the usual trial the boy declared
with sobs that he could not remember
just how it all happened, but he had no
intention of killing his father; and a
jury of 10 men and two women gave
the usual verdict of not guilty. In fact,
they stopped the case without hearing
counsel; Judge Parsons, who said he
entirely agreed with them, having indi-
cated that course as open to them if they
felt like it. The Law can be a kindly old
abstraction in these man-to-man and
fear-of-death cases ; forgetting its alleged
majesty, and accepting the intuition of
the rnan-in-the-street as a pretty safe
guide.—Adel. (S.A.).
Maoriland’s Exchange Policy
From the beginning the M.L. Govern-
ment’s exchange policy has been under
fire. Of late criticism has been intensi-
fied because of the high cost of it to
the country, as shown in the national
accounts.
The Importers’ Federation has pub-
lished a calculation that, in addition to a
direct cost of £7,440,000 last financial
year, there were indirect costs totalling
£7,130,000. Finance Minister Coates’s
reply was that the figures were fantastic,
and that £1,187,000 of sales tax, included
in indirect costs, wasn’t necessitated by
the exchange situation, and was included
in direct costs anyway.
Prof. Tocker, who has constituted him-
self an apostle of high exchange, says
the Government rakes in £4,500,000 of
extra tax revenue as the result of the de-
preciation of the currency. But that is
poor comfort to a community whose
efforts to ride the depression have been
hampered by steadily-increasing taxa-
tion.—Lyttelton (M.L.).
Pay of Commonwealth Employees
A reply to “Rules of the Game” (B.
4/7/’34), written on behalf of the many
Federal-servant readers of your paper in
Victoria. The £6 cost-of-living adjust-
ment has been suspended only in respect
of employees on the basic wage. £174
“Got a deener on yer, Dig.?”
“Yes, but I haven’t time to show it to you now!"
per annum. This suspension was in
recognition of the sacrifices made in
1931: £lB cost-of-living adjustment,
voluntarily given up three months before
it was due ; £l6 cost-of-living adjustment
put into operation 12 months before it
was due.
Whilst it is _ correct that a five-day
week has been introduced in the Federal
service, it cannot be called a “compensa-
tion,” as the four hours short-worked
on Saturday are made up over the five
days of the week. This has resulted in
a saving in expenditure. Many private
employers follow the same policy to
reduce working expenses.
The article refers to restoration of
salary-cuts as a “gift.” Surely your
paper is aware of the spirit of the
Premiers’ Plan—equality of sacrifice. It
is demonstrable that, as far as the Federal
sphere is concerned, much of the taxa-
tion remitted in the last two years is
taxation that was in force before the
enactment of the Financial Emergency
Act. Federal public servants contend
that it is compatible with fair play that
relief be applied equitably; that is to
say, those whose incomes were reduced
by the special emergency legislation
should be relieved just as those whose
incomes were taxed. — Fred J. Webb, hon.
secretary (Vic.) State Council of Com-
monwealth Public Service Organisations.
Specialised Trades
A point that has not received the con-
sideration it deserves is the effect of
chain stores on specialised trades. The
retailer of tradesmen’s tools could not
exist without the help of sales of cheap
tools to the “odd-job” man and home
carpenter. Capture of this business by
the chain would leave the legitimate tool-
dealer with one of two alternatives: to
put up the shutters or demand a greatly
increased profit on trade tools —a slow-
seller at the best of times. The same
applies to other specialised trades.
What to do about it? Have each store
licensed to sell a specified line, and allow
only license-holders to sell any of such
goods. Qualification to include the
carrying of a complete range to meet any
reasonable demand for the line in ques-
tion.—Penstick (N.S.W.).
Proportional Representation
Claude James, sometime Tas. Nat.
Chief Secretary, is quoted as giving first
prize for idiocy in the late State election
to a person in Bass who voted the full
Nat. ticket, then the full Labor ticket
(B. 4/7/’34). I say the “idiot” voted
correctly.
Labor had to be represented. In vot-
ing the Nat. ticket, placing the Laborite
nearest the Nat. ideal next on his list,
and grading them down until the out-
and-outer was marked last, the person
in Bass took a hand in electing the
Laborites least objectionable to him. In
short, he did what the originators of the
Hare-Clarke system intended every voter
to do —exercised his full voting privilege.
But if Chief Secretaries don’t under-
stand the system, what hope is there for
Tom, Dick and Harry?— Ulverstone
(Tas.).
Italians on the M.I.A.
On the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area
ten years ago the Italian was practically
unknown. To-day he owns 200 farms and
the Italian population is well over 1000.
Last year 90 per cent, of the land trans-
fers was made to the Italian. Seemingly
nothing can be done to prevent the
alienation of a settlement on which the
Government spent millions to provide
homes for returned Diggers.
A few on the area contend that Luigi
is a very desirable settler from every
point of view, and has a much more re-
fined standard of living than the Aus-
tralian. Perhaps this argument is based
on a recent wedding feast lasting three
days, when the Italian participants con-
sumed 100 gallons of wine, a calf, three
pigs and 150 chickens. —R. (N.S.W.).
Optometrists and Oculists
While admiring the moderate tone of
“M.B.’s” letter (B. 27/6/ ’34), I join issue
with him on the subject of recognition
(not treatment) of disease. Under British
law an optometrist must be able to recog-
nise disease and refer it to the necessary
quarter for appropriate treatment.
An optometrist in Wales failed to diag-
nose a condition involving conical
cornea, was sued for damages, and lost.
The case was carried to a higher Court,
where the point was definitely decided
that an optometrist is responsible for
recognising any diseased condition of the
eye and referring the case for medical
treatment.
To give facilities for training in this
respect, there are now refraction hos-
pitals, controlled entirely by optometrists,
in London, Glasgow and Leeds, as well
as clinics. There are clinics in Australia
—Brisbane has one —and there is, of
course, the Adelaide Uni. optometry
course.
The eye needs of the public will be best
catered for when the same co-operation
exists between optometrist and oculist
as now exists between dentist and
medico. — Pommy F. 1.0. (Q.).
“Demand Your National Dividend!"
The secretariat of the Douglas Credit
movement has issued another manifesto
in which it is made clear that we are all
“tenants for life of the heritage of civili-
sation." Civilisation is scarcely a heri-
tage. It is a product of an age. More-
over, it is a relative term, and if all we
inherited was the civilisation of each age
as it passed few of us would have any
reason to be pleased. The savage who
has a cocoanut-tree to sleep under and
the shinbone of his enemy to chew is, in
his own estimation, as civilised as we are.
And old-fashioned Chinese who would
refuse to travel in a train and who think
soya bean pounded with lime is a fine,
nourishing food regard us as barbarians.
What the Douglas people really want
us to do is to throw away everything
we have in economic organisation and
exchange it for a shibboleth which
cranks have invented. The lucid some-
thing which they now ask us to adopt
is set out thus:
1. Regulation of prices— i.e., the balanc-
ing of claims against assets.
2. The national dividend— i.e., the
recognition of humanity as tenants for life.
It is actually contended that a system
based on an artificial adjustment of
prices and manipulation of resources
could provide everybody with “a national
dividend.” I daresay the arty young
things who spout Douglasism don’t really
believe in such nonsense. Half the time
they don’t know what they believe, and
the other half they are just exercising a
natural human longing for something
adventurous and “different” from exist-
ence in a sphere which confines them
week in and week out to a city office
and a regular tram route. —El V.
(N.S.W).

AT COAL HARBOR.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
WHEN Richard de Wilde came to
New South Wales he was no
exemplary character. But the
Recording Angel must have had a credit
in the ultimate reckoning when it came
to be balanced up in 1863.
The circumstance which sent him to
Australia was a peculiar one.
His people lived near Reading.
Although they had been English close
upon four generations, they were origi-
nally Dutch who had migrated from Hol-
land in the wake of William of Orange.
London merchants first, they had become
landed proprietors in Oxfordshire, and
had owned the beautiful estate of Len-
ham Hall for more than sixty years
when Richard de Wilde was born.
His father, Sir Peter de Wilde, had
died in 1794, and this was a very great
misfortune for the son. If ever a youth
needed a guiding hand during adoles-
cence, it was Dicky. He was an only
child, and his mother insisted upon keep-
ing him by her and educating him at
home under a series of weak and ineffi-
cient tutors. Eton, Rugby, Harrow
or Winchester might have been his sal-
vation. As it was, he grew into manhood
an unmitigated “Gussie.”
He went to Oxford —to New College
—when he was twenty, and remained
there for three years, profitless to him-
self and to the University. Then he went
to London, and lived in rooms in Jermyn-
street. That was in 1801.
Towards the end of the summer of
1802, we find Dicky at Lenharn Hall
with four bloods to bear him company.
The eldest was not more than 25, but
in experience of the world, the flesh and
the devil each of them had at least ten
years’ advantage of Dicky.
“Ensign Latford, of the Coldstream
Guards,” it is recorded in an old betting
book, “wagers with Mr. Richard de
Wilde that he, Mr. de Wilde, doth not
dare, alone and unaccompanied, to hold
up ye Oxford mail coach in ye guise of a
highway robber, in ye sum of 500gns.
against 100gns., on any night during ye
current month of September, 1802, on
any part of ye road between London and
Oxford.”
Young Mr. de Wilde won —and lost.
He held up the Oxford mail coach, with
disastrous results to himself. The guard
fired his blunderbuss, and nearly blew the
head off Mr. de Wilde’s horse. Robert
Toplady and Will Toogood, the Bow-
street runners, on their way down to
Oxfordshire in pursuit of another male-
factor, added to their laurels by
capturing this one as he lay stunned in
the roadway beneath his mutilated
mount.
But the most distressing feature of the
lamentable affair was that the Rev. Sep-
timus Bowes, D.D., expired of heart
failure in the interior of the coach one
minute after the guard had fired off his
piece of hand-artillery.
The person who really caused the
death of Dr. Bowes was, of course, the
guard with his bellowing blunderbuss.
But the law of England very properly
held Mr. de Wilde responsible, as the
Judge pointed out to the jury at the
Assizes, and that young gentleman was
found guilty of murder.
“You have,” said Mr. Justice Lyne
in passing sentence of death, “only to
thank yourself for the position in which
you now stand. It is very well to explain
that the affair was but a joke which
ended tragically. ’Twas no joke for the
lamented victim of your reckless folly,
nor is it one for his widow and orphaned
daughters. I regard your forthcoming
decease at the hands of the hangman as
a very fortunate circumstance.”
But Ensign Latford’s father had friends
at Court, and young Mr. de Wilde
was spared the indignity of being com-
pelled to dance upon nothing outside
Newgate. So he arrived in Port Jackson,
a prisoner for life, in the transport Ocean
on November 26, 1803.
It is a century or more since the mouth
of the Hunter, 67 miles north of the
Heads of Port Jackson, was known as
Coal Harbor. Somewhere about 100,000
people dwell in its vicinity to-day. When
Mr. Richard de Wilde first made its
acquaintance, the return of a general
muster gives the total population of the
district as 95—20 civil and military
officials and soldiers, 61 convicts (six
were females) four free women and ten
children.
In 1801 Governor King sent Ensign
Barralier, of the N.S.W. Corps, to sur-
vey the lower river in his Majesty’s
armed surveying vessel Lady Nelson,
Lieut. James Grant, R.N., commander.
He made an excellent map of the Hunter
and Paterson, except that above the junc-
tion he misnamed them, calling the main
river the Paterson and its tributary the
Hunter. The names on the chart have
nearly all been changed.
Port Hunter, for instance, is labelled
Coal Harbor. Nobby’s is Coal Island,
and the rising ground up which the
present city spreads to the southward is
marked Sheep Pasture Hills. The head-
land opposite Nobby’s, whence the guns
of Fort Scratchley peep over its parapet
at the Tasman Sea, is named Collier
Point. It was thereabout that the first
coal-mining in the district was done, in
the open face of the cliff.
But there is a sketch of the place, made
about this time, which is even more in-
teresting than the map. There are vis-
ible only nine buildings, most of them
huts. There were others, of course, out
of sight. The Coal Island, higher than
it is to-day, stands well clear of the land
—it was not until twenty years later that
the breakwater was begun. A brig
is anchored in the stream, about oppo-
site to where the Newcastle and Hunter
River Company’s boats berth in these
days. The hills and valleys leading down
to the river are for the most part bare
of trees, though there are one or two
considerable belts of timber along the
first rise above the waterside. The only
part of the picture that remains practi-
cally the same to-day as it was then is
the long, curving coastline stretching
northward to Port Stephens, with the dis-
tant blue mountains in the background.
After the Irish rebels at Castle Hill
were overcome Governor King deter-
mined to send those whom he considered
to be the most mutinous and dangerous
to some place outside the bounds of the
colony. He selected the mouth of the
Hunter as a suitable spot. A small party
had previously done a little rudimentary
coal-mining there, but had been with-
drawn a year or so previously, and the
river was only occasionally visited for
the purpose of cutting cedar or taking
away a little of the coal that had been
dug out of the face of the cliff.
Lieutenant Menzies of the Marines was
appointed Commandant, and he sailed
from Sydney in the Lady Nelson on
March 28, 1804. Two other vessels accom-
panied him, and he took with him a sur-
geon, eleven soldiers and n.c.os., and
thirty-four convicts. Amongst the latter
was Mr. Richard de Wilde.
They had put him in a road gang on
his arrival, and he had done three
months of the hardest kind of toil, before
the superintendent, needing a clerk, had
set him book-keeping. That was at Castle
Hill. By great good fortune he had con-
trived to steer clear of the abortive rebel-
lion in March, 1804 —being absent on
business for the superintendent in Parra-
matta when it broke out on the evening
of the 4th. When Lieutenant Menzies
was organising his expedition, he asked
the authorities at Parramatta to select
him a clerk, and Dicky was chosen. So
we find him installed at headquarters at
Coal Harbor in April of that year.
It was a moonlight evening when Mr.
Patrick O’Riordan encountered this com-
mandant’s clerk as he strolled along the
harbor beach, just below the settlement,
after a busy day in the office. Mr. de
Wilde was experiencing one of those
moods of despondency and discontent
which periodically atfect all exiles in the
first years of banishment.
“Th’ top av th’ avenin’ to ye,” Mr.
O'Riordan greeted him. “Th’ black
mare’s in foal. 1 say th’ black mare’s in
foal.” He repeated this interesting piece
of news in an emphatic manner which
impressed the startled Mr. de Wilde. He
knew O’Riordan to be one of the leaders
of the Irish prisoners.
“The black mare!” he said, halting. “I
didn’t know there was any horseflesh at
the Coal River. How on earth did she
get here?”
“Faith, thin, she’s not here at all, at
all,” said Mr. O'Riordan.
“Well, what about her, anyhow?
Who’s she in foal to?”
To his astonishment, the other ex-
tended his hand. Mechanically he put
his out also, and it was seized and
wrung with much fervor and at great
length.
“Sure,” said Mr. O’Riordan; “for
whoi did ye not say so at wance?”
“I was thinking of something else
when you spoke to me. Who is she in
foal to?”
“Come wid me,” said O’Riordan, tak-
ing Dicky by the arm and directing his
steps across the beach to the scrubby
bank of the river mouth. “There’s thim
as’ll be glad to see ye. Ye have th’
worrud. Come wid me, now.”
Mr. de Wilde suffered himself to be
led inland. They proceeded up the hill-
side for half a mile or so, until they
arrived at a little bark-roofed hut just
below the crest of the rise. Through the
chinks between its slabs came the gleam
of firelight, and he could hear a hum of
low-pitched conversation. O’Riordan
knocked with a stone five times upon the
door —two quick taps, followed by three
slow ones —and it was almost imme-
diately opened to them. His conductor
gave him a push, and he found himself
in the smoky interior, where were squat-
ting about the earthern floor ten or a
dozen men, unmistakably Irish. The fire-
light lit up their wild faces.
“B’ys,” said Mr. O’Riordan, “he’s all
right, so he is. ’Tis himself that knows
all about the black mare. He’s wan av
us. We’ve a friend at headquarters—a
mahn in th’ inimy’s camp. Tell him all
about th’ matther, Pat Casey.”
The amazed Mr. de Wilde listened in
silence to a revelation of the maddest
scheme he had ever heard of. He had
been told of strange imaginings on the
part of these Irish prisoners—their belief
that it was possible to reach China over-
land, their faith in the existence of cities
and civilisation to the westward of the
Blue Mountains, their confidence that
they could prevail against disciplined and
well-armed troops, the curious notion
that the French Republic had ships and
men close at hand, ready to assist in an
overthrow of the Government —but he
had never heard of anything wilder than
this.
Lieutenant Menzies, the sergeant, two
corporals and eight soldiers of the little
garrison were to be killed, and when the
schooner from Sydney next anchored in
Coal Harbor she was to be seized. Her
crew disposed of, the prisoners would go
aboard her and proceed up the Hunter to
a great lake out of which the river flowed.
On the shores of this lake dwelt a free
and enlightened community—nationality
not specified, except that it was not
Sassenach—living in a city as fine as
Dublin itself, which would extend a hand
of welcome and good fellowship to
patriots escaping from bondage.
That was all. He was to be the traitor
within the gates. And this complete confi-
dence was reposed in him on the strength
of his having made a very obvious reply
in response to an extraordinary state-
ment relating to a vague black mare.
The meeting broke up at midnight.
Amongst his sensations of pity and
laughter, one thing alone was clear in
his. understanding. There would be no
massacre of Lieutenant Menzies and the
soldiers. He would take care of that.
There had been a sleepless night for
young Mr. de Wilde as he tossed and
turned beneath his single blanket on the
litter of ferns and leaves in his tiny hut.
A hideous thought had come into his
head. As the slow hours of darkness
passed intolerably by, he had sought to
put it behind him, to get rid of it, in
a score of diverse ways. He would lie
on his back and set himself to recall
his boyhood life at Lenham Hall —of
his mother, of trivial remembered inci-
dents of sport and pleasure, of things
his tutors had taught him.
His life on the hulk in the Thames,
on the transport, in the iron-gang at
Castle Hill and Toongabbee—he lay and
thought of all the varied and surprising
experiences that had been his since he
had heard sentence of death pronounced
upon him at Oxford. No use! The
notion could not be smothered, hidden
out of sight of his mind, put away at all.
At last, in shame and loathing of him-
self, he accepted it. Just before the
dawn he fell asleep and dreamed that he
was in eternal torment, and that he knew,
with bitterness, how well he had de-
served it.
He awoke at sunrise with a sense of
great trouble upon him. But he had
made his mind up. The infamous thing
was to be done. He would himself be
infamous—but he would be free. He
would betray these fools who had con-
fided to him their hopeless plan. Most
of them would doubtless be hanged even-
tually. Why not now, when their deaths
would benefit him?
He cooked his meagre breakfast, and
at half-past eight walked across to the
Commandant’s office, where he would
find Mr. Menzies already at work, and
alone. .
But the Commandant was not alone. As
De Wilde passed outside the open door,
he beheld Mr. Patrick O’Riordan, stand-
ing bolt upright, addressing Mr. Menzies
with convincing eloquence. Mr! Men-
zies, seated at his desk, was not visible
to him.
“So that’s it, y’r ’Anner.” O’Riordan
was in the throes of his peroration. “ ’Tis
that way it is. Black shame to the blag-
gards! Afther th’ way y’r ’Anner’s
trated ’um. There’s Shamus O’Brien,
Michael Toohey, Terence McManus,
Jamesy Houlihan —thim’s th’ ringleaders.
I cudn’t rist aisy nor ate bite nor sup
afore I tould y’r ’Anner. ’Tis not f’r me
to suggist things to ye, sorr; but mebbe
ye’d consider what I’ve tould ye wud
be worth a par-rdon from th’ Gov’nor,
y’r ’Anner.”
Mr. de Wilde shuddered. All his life
he shuddered when he thought what he
might have been. God, what an escape!


Putting the “Mo” in Movies.
FRITH and The Psychologist recently
decided to go to Hollywood. It was
a beautiful day. The sun shone, the
sea looked friendly, everything seemed
favorable; but the American Consul put
his foot dowp, saying in a loud voice that
he’d see them goldarned before he’d sign
their passports.
Asked for reasons, he referred to the
shipping strike and mentioned the Blue
Eagle, though neither of them could see
“Director Ken Hall wearing a worried
expression in accordance with the,
best models.”
why that should be brought into it any
more than the Black Bull, the Green
Dragon or any other tavern.
Finally he explained that the 1934
quota for artists and psychologists had
been filled by 9.43 a.m. on January 1,
and that under N.I.R.A. no more
would be admitted until 1947, and then
only on payment of large bonds for
good behavior.
This was rather a blow. Frith and The
Psychologist gave the Consul back what
was left of his cigars and walked out.
It was still a fine day outside, so, not
to be frustrated, they went to Cinesound
Studios at Rushcutter Bay, where a band
of gallant workers is attempting to out-
holly Hollywood.
Entering the portals of the filmatorium
they were conducted by ways dark and
devious into the stoodio.
“Shush! Quiet! Shush!” greeted
them, and they realised that they were
on the historic spot where “The Silence
of Dean Maitland” first made itself
heard.
Shushing and pausing, they looked
around. At the far end of the stoodio a
scene was being shot, but near at hand
was the Dean himself, looking quite
Longdenish and very un-deanish.
“He looks every inch a dean when he’s
deaning,” whispered Frith.
The few minutes’ silent intercession
was apparently over, as people were
moving about and talking once more.
Director Ken Hall came along wear-
ing horn-rimmed spectacles and a wor-
ried expression in accordance with the
best models; and Frank Hurley, who is
familiarly known as Uncle Tom by
virtue of his fluffy tuft of back hair (see
diagram attached), roamed about rest-
lessly. This, no doubt, is a habit formed
when he used to go about in peril of his
life among the man-eating penguins at
the South Pole.
The whole place looked like the sort
of nightmare Professor Heath Robinson
would have after a particularly hard day
in the laboratory.
Pieces of staging hung haphazard from
the roof, which was lined with sand-
bags as a precaution against air raids or
cat-burglars or something. Thousands
of yards of electric cable were coiled and
twisted around everyone and everything.
Pulleys, levers, beams and joists pulled,
levered, beamed and joisted on all sides,
and wires and ropes connected every-
thing with something else—not neces-
sarily the nearest. something.
Wherever a tripod could be fitted in,
there it was. Cameras large and small
stood by, looking self-conscious, and
anywhere and everywhere were scattered
lights and still more lights. If the beams
from these lights were placed end on
end they would stretch to Hollywood ;
but that’s not Cinesound’s idea. Their
combined strength must run into millions
of candlepower, and if they are all turned
on at once (and what’s the good of hav-
ing them if you don’t turn ’em all on at
once?) they make a very good substitute
for sunlight.
It may be asked “Why not use real
sunlight, and let the lights go hang?”
The reply, of course, is “What’s the use
of having a stoodio if you don’t use it?”
The sets built for the production of
“Strike Me Lucky” are most realistic.
“’Struth, it’s Mae West!” said The
Psychologist. But closer • investigation
proved that the Hesperian figure loung-
ing elegantly outside Lowenstein’s
Second-hand Clothes Shop belonged to
Yvonne Banvard. Face, form and dress
were perfect. The voice was there, and
so were the wisecracks ; also the man-
nerisms, even to the affected patting of
the back hair.
Standing outside the Cuddle-Up
Cabaret was a perfect vision. Lorraine
Smith’s part in the farce may not be a
“Looked suspiciously like Hamilton
Webber.”
M.O (Roy Rene is his other name).
huge one, but as long as she stands in
front of the camera and looks natural
she’ll be worth every penny she gets.
A German band loitered on the corner,
looking very Australian, with the excep-
tion of the concertina player, who was
decidedly Neapolitan, and the conductor,
who, despite his fierce moustache and
pillowed tunic, looked suspiciously like
Hamilton Webber.
The band struck up, and a familiar
figure came round the corner. The
shuffling walk, the 10-day beard, the
sideways glance. Right first time! Of
course, it could be no one but Mo.
It is astounding the power this man
has of raising a laugh. His every action
and gesture are amusing. Even those
working on the set and watching his
act for the second, twentieth or two-
hundredth time find themselves grin-
ning.
During his long spell on the Aus-
tralian stage, he has had many critics,
but his admirers are not all among the
lowbrows, and there is no doubt that in
his own line he is something of a genius.
There are very few comedians who
have the ability to rock an audience with
laughter by the merest gesture or glance.
Chaplin is one, Robey another. Mo is
certainly a third.
Lord Beauchamp, no mean critic, has
always been an ardent admirer of Mo,
and has time and again asserted that
there is no one on the English stage to
approach him.
However, to change back to the
stoodio
Mo, with his pal Scotty, approaches his
home, to find all his furniture, including
the family portraits of Pa and Ma, on
the footpath. He has been evicted. They
sit down in the gutter.
“It’s a cru-el world we live in,” sobs
Mo on to Scotty’s shoulder, “with its
trials and ter-ibulations. Life’s full of
disappointments.”
“Gin would have been more appropriate.”
A spirit voice breaks in from some-
where.
“Can’t hear a word. The band’s
drowning it.”
Advice comes freely.
The band must play more softly. The
band must go further away from the
mike. The mike must come closer to
Mo. Mo must speak louder.
All these suggestions are acted upon,
but still the petulant voice complains that
it can’t hear a word. Apparently it be-
longs to someone who is entitled to hear
a word.
By this time the band is playing so
softly that the players are beginning to
wonder why they are in the place at all.
They have been pushed so far back that
they’re hardly in it anyway. The mike
has been lowered until it absorbs all the
cameraman’s attention and threatens to
ruin the shot altogether.
The Voice is satisfied.
“0.K.,” it remarks triumphantly.
It has apparently heard a word.
A halt for afternoon-tea. The sight
of Mo eating cream cakes and drinking
tea merely reveals him as a human
being, but when Maevonne Westvard
toys with a cup she gives herself away at
once as a spurious imitation. Certainly
“it ain’t no sin” to drink tea, but gin
would be more appropriate, or, at least,
a noggin of the “plonk” which Mo offers
her in the film.
The male quartet which has been
lounging on the corner of the verandah
behind Mo now does its stuff.
A little moustache trouble is experi-
enced, and the face decorator steps for-
ward with scissors and other lethal
weapons. Basso One’s Ronald Colman
appendage passes muster, but his col-
league’s Kaiser Willy undergoes a quick
transformation, and a Hank Mann effect
is produced. The virgin soil of the
tenor’s face is left undisturbed, but the
alto’s Dundrearys are hacked and
“Hurley is all concentration.”
chopped until he looks very like Franz
Josef —as Franz Josef would have looked
had he been a Surrey Hills lounger in-
stead of an Emperor.
Bells ring Quiet! Action!
The band strikes up (faintly distant).
Mo sobs afresh, and the loungers sadly
commence “Watch our smiling fa-ces.”
Hamilton Webber conducts the band as
well as he knows how, the quartet as
well as they’ll let him, and himself as
well as can be expected in the circum-
stances.
“That’ll do! Stop!”
The band is in trouble again. The
conductor tells Puccini, the concertina
player, to shift to the other end of the
set. The object is, apparently, to allow
the strains of his instrument to come to
the singers over their left shoulders.
Puccini! Surely this is not the com-
poser of “Madame Butterfly”? Well,
well!
Hurley is all concentration. Seated
behind his camera, one eye glued to the
eye-piece, he is giving a realistic imper-
sonation of “master gunner on a 20,000-
tonner,” his left hand signalling that the
last shell fell 200 yards short, and that
if they raise her half a point the next
one’ll blow the blighter to smithereens.
But this has, apparently, been mostly
play, for now he rushes off and dons a
black garment which makes him look
like Mephistopheles or Father Anselm.
Ah! Here it comes!
Ding-a-ling! “Silence! ” “Action! ”
The concertina concerts, Mo sobs and
the songsters take up the tale again.
“Watch our smiling fa-ces.”
All is well until the final line: “Come,
come, come, ad infin.”
Ronald is called to task, and complains
that Hank’s moustache muffles his
(Hank’s) voice and puts him (Ronald)
off his note.
Ronald reveals artistic temperament,
and rightly so.
The set adjourns to thrash the matter
out.
The obvious course —further opera-
tions on Hank’s moustache to give a
Hitlerish effect —is not suggested.
The conference threatens to last a long
time, so Frith and The Psychologist steal
away.
But they intend to see “Strike Me
Lucky” when it is released, if only to see
how the difficulty was finally overcome.
The People of the Wind.
They say the yellow leaves that blow
Along the highways in the glow
Of frosty dawns and wintry eves,
The little, harried, frightened leaves
That rustle in a sudden flight
And whisper to the coming night,
Are wearied, wandering souls of those
Who cannot find a last repose.
The People of the Wind (they say)
Seek here, seek there, seek every way
For that sweet rest the soul should know
After a life of strife and woe;
And every fallen autumn leaf
Will hearken to their lonely grief
And bear a stricken soul to gain
That peace for which they all are fain.
I watched them in the lane to-night
Whirl high against the sunset light;
I heard a muffled, mournful cry
Upon the breeze as they passed by:
And then I prayed that unto each
God’s pity through the dark might reach —
They who have suffered as they sinned,
The eerie People of the Wind.

LILLA GORMHUILLE MCKAY.
Lay of the Last Optimist.
In days prehistoric, when I was a lad,
I’d an antediluvian way,
Or, at best, mediaeval, sepulchrally sad,
With never the pluck to be gay;
But now I’ve grown older and bolder, bedad!
I laugh, though the devil’s to pay.
For why should we scurry?
Why should we worry?
Why should we worry? I say.
The grass is so green, and the sea is so blue,
And so much we’re in love, you and I,
All’s a dream in a dream that has somehow
come true
’Neath the flame of a fairyland sky.
And, to make the dream perfect, you’re
dreaming it, too,
Little lady of laughter! so why,
Ah! why should we scurry?
Why should we flurry?
Why should we worry? say I.
We’re happy, so happy (sing, oyster and owl),
Millennium’s here for to-day.
Old Gen’ral Depression has thrown in the
towel
And the Walrus has woofled away.
Lord! we’ve listened too long to the pessimist’s
howl;
Hark once to an optimist’s bray!
Why should we scurry?
Why should we flurry?
Why should we worry? I say.
Sing ho! for Utopia, roses and rings,
Hey presto! the pig in the sty,
With perfect and pure pulchritudinous wings,
May pose in the sweet by-and-bye!
We may see all our cabbages turn into kings,
And the pork on our platters. may fly!
So why should we scurry?
Why should we flurry?
Why should we worry? say I.

The Trap.
BY VANCE PALMER.
THE mouse in the corner exasperated
Corder. In a confused way he
associated it with young Verney:
the quick movements, the furtive aggres-
siveness, the bright eyes. Now it was
behind the row of vinegar-bottles, now
among the brown paper he had thrown
down carelessly when he had unpacked.
A gross of matches at fourpence-ha’penny.
How could he concentrate when he felt
that nibbling at the back of his skull,
boring into the soft matter of his brain?
In front of the tea-shop across the
road Miss Donovan, in her plaid skirt,
was arranging flowers on the small green
tables, pausing now and again to gaze
down the slope. His eyes wandered to
her neat ankles, her trim-waisted figure.
From the living-room at the back of the
store the wireless still sounded, a bland,
florid voice slipping in advertisements
between the gramophone selections:
“Let us make a quick visit of inspec-
tion to the new Palais de Luxe. We
enter the foyer and find ourselves imme-
diately at home. I’m sure none of you
can help admiring and approving ol
the treatment. The walls, as you see,
display a ribbon walnut veneer, from the
patterned terrazzo floor to the moulded
plaster ceiling”....
But this voice, muffled by the closed
door, was soothing as a distant fall of
water ; it didn’t bite into the mind like
that quiet nibbling, didn’t call up images
of the business being undermined,
crumbling at the base. And more insis-
tent than either was the inner voice that
had gone on all day. If you don’t take
action now he’ll think he’s bluffed you.
You gave him the run of the store, and
he took you down. A word to the police
this evening as you’re driving past on
your way to the hospital....
Slipping from his chair he took a new
trap from the stock, picking up a crumb
of cheese from the counter. Abstractedly
he struck a match and let the yellow flame
curl up around the bait. There was
silence in the shop, broken only by the
burring voice from the living-room:
“The time is now five minutes past
three.... Five minutes past three.”
And immediately Corder thought:
“Three o’clock. It’s all over now.
They’ll have wheeled her out of the
operating-theatre back to the ward.”
Since lunch he hadn’t let his mind rest
on what was happening to Vi; there was
this other thing that nagged at him. And
she hadn’t been inclined to make heavy
weather of it when he had seen her the
night before ; it was almost as if she had
come to like operations. But would this
one be any more successful than the ones
before? They had a great belief in the
knife, these doctors. Money in it! Easy
for them to make a living when they had
to deal mainly with credulous women
who were always ready to be persuaded
that something inside them was out of
place.
Cars were flowing down the road when,
blinking at the light, he went to the door,
a morose, owlish figure in his thick
glasses and frayed pullover. One would
have thought it was a holiday seeing that
glittering procession of cars, but they
were mostly driven by leisured women
or young girls. No depression for them!
A fine day, so let’s have a run to the
hills!
Leaning against the lintel he looked
sourly over to where a nickelled Fiat
was drawn up under the plane-tree out-
side Miss Donovan’s, a girl in blue slacks
and black beret standing on the foot-
board with one leg swinging loosely.
“Tea?” came the high-pitched voice.
“Oh, rot; we’re not going to stop for tea.
I only want some chocs, and cigarettes.”
It was the first day of real spring.
Everywhere the rain-soaked ground
seemed to bubble with warmth and
moisture, and the big elm outside the
store was trembling into bud. Across
the road grassy paddocks fell away into
a valley that was cut up into small
orchards foaming with the blossom of
cherry-plums. A blue, bright wind
moved across the slope, stirring the manes
of the feeding ponies. The mountains
far away had puffballs of cloud resting
on their peaks, and looked as if they
were tipped with snow.
But it was the tent under the walnut-
trees of the slope that caught the store-
keeper’s eye and held it. Young Verney
was lying on his back in a patch of sun
while a toddling youngster played about
him, pulling handfuls of grass, dropping
them on his face. He lazily stretched
out his arm and brushed the grass away ;
he drew the youngster to him and pulled
it down to sprawl on his chest. Faint
echoes of laughter floated up the hillside,
lost themselves in the colored air.
Outside the store, sunlight, gaiety, the
flow and shimmer of life! Inside, the
gloom of the grave—fish compressed in
tins, the juices of animals and fruits in
bottles, ripened grain powdered to dust
and bagged or stored neatly in packets.
Then those predatory eyes, watching
from the cracks in the skirting.
Darkness fell like a blanket on Corder’s
mind.
“Young waster! Thinks I’m soft
enough to keep my mouth shut and let
him get away with it. Trading on having
a wife and youngster.... Well, we’ll
see.”
He turned away from the wash of
sunlight, the delirious throb of new green.
The country was swarming with fellows
like young Verney. Marrying at twenty
or so and thinking the possession of a
youngster or so gave them a claim on
other people’s sympathy —even when
they loafed on the job and took their
employers down. All this talk of Russia
and a new deal. You couldn’t do any-
thing with people who hadn’t character.
Cutting across his moody thoughts
came the voice from inside:
“Now we’re going to have something
cheerful. ‘No One’s Too Old for a Bit
of Loving,’ by the Cantor boys, with
ukulele accompaniment.... ‘No One’s
Too Old for a Bit of Loving.’ ”
He bent over his accounts again, sniff-
ing at the smell of toasted cheese. The
mouse had suddenly become silent,
almost as if it suspected something. He
imagined its small, pinpoint eyes watch-
ing him from the darkness of the corner,
studying his turned back. Cunning! It
probably had a family of young ones
hidden down behind the skirting.
“Well? What are you going to do
about it?”
The question came at him derisively
from the tow of figures. If he didn't
take action now it would be too late, yet
he loathed committing himself. There
was always prejudice in these country
parts against anyone using the law ; be-
sides, it would mean a day wasted in the
courts, more time spent in hunting after
someone to look after the shop while
he was away. Yet that indolent figure,
lying contentedly in the sun, enjoying
his enforced leisure, letting the youngster
cover him with grass and flowers....
Time and again he went over the scene
of the morning, flogging up his ebbing
passion, stiffening his relaxed will.
“You own up to taking it, then?....
Thought you’d brought it out as a present
for the missus.... It was left there as a
test Bait with a hook inside, eh? ....
Call it what you like You can dock
the value from my week’s wages
They’re the last you’ll earn here....
And what about overtime?.... Don't
talk to me about overtime The
union’ll have something to say, then. ...
It’ll be the law that’ll get its word in
first.”
Flushed faces, staring eyes, nerves
frayed at the edges! But he had held him-
self in check, for he was afraid the boy
would run amok and go for him bull-
headed. There was that streak of violence
in him: it showed in his eyes, in the set
of his head, even in his movements be-
hind the counter:
“You can’t bully me. One job’s as
good to me as another. I don’t take
things lying down.'’
The mouse had started again, but it
was higher up now —behind the tins of
biscuits on the first shelf! He took off
his glasses and wiped them, staring over
into the dusty corner that was shut off
from the light. Little bastard! It must
know all the chinks in the skirting and
be able to slip in and out as it liked.
But it was too cute to take risks while
he was there. As soon as he had closed
the store and started off downhill toward
the hospital it would be out in the middle
Q f the floor, running all over the counter,
probably, sniffing at any cheese or bacon
that wasn’t well covered,
“j’ ve trusted you for months, now.
Ldff you in full charge while I was away,
This j s what I’ve got out of it.”
Across the chequered pattern of the
e im-tree’s shadow the Donovan woman
came fluttering, her brief plaid skirt
sw j ng i n g vigorously, a letter in her hand.
Buxom and a little breathless, there was
a ijghtfoot ease in her movements, the
spar |fl e 0 f health in her eyes. She entered
tbe sbop as jf curre nts of bright, moving
a j r came with her.
« Goi down to-night again, Mr.
Gorder 9”

She tossed the letter on the countei.
“Then post this, if you don’t mind;
it missed the morning mai1..... And for
heaven’s sake don’t brood too much over
Vi. She’s not taking it as seriously as
you are. Any woman’s glad enough to
away from her home for a while.”
" He blinked, lips drawing away sar-
donically from the irregular teeth,
“Think it’s just a holiday, do you?”

“Well, what?”
“You’re not going to push it any
further?”
“That’s the business of the police. I’ll

“Nonsense. What’s the use of being
spiteful?”

2. Eat These foods—One or
two eggs, raw fruit, fresh vege-
tables, lettuce, cabbage, or celery,
half a lemon with orange juice.

T7ROM the Pepsodent Laboratories
•*- came a new cleansing and polishing
material which is now used exclusively in
Pepsodent Tooth Paste. This material
is fine in texture and twice as soft as
material commonly used in tooth pastes.
It is Pepsodent’s policy to advance
constantly through scientific experiment.
It is a direct result of this policy that this
new improvement is brought to you.
Three outstanding virtues characterise
this notable discovery:
i. The new cleansing and polishing
material in Pepsodent stands unsur-
passed in removing stained, destruc-
tive FILM.
2. The new texture is invisibly fine. As
a result it imparts a higher polish to
enamel—a brilliant glaze or lustre.
3. The new material is safe —this is most
important of all. Safe because it’s
soft —yes, twice as soft as polishing
materials in common use.
PEPSODENT—
Special Film-removing Tooth Paste.
Removing FILM is, and always will be,
Pepsodent’s chief duty. To-day’s Pepso-
dent performs that duty better than any
tooth paste ever has before.
FILM is that slippery coating on
your teeth. It gathers germs that cause
decay. It glues them tightly to enamel.
FILM absorbs the stains from food and
smoking and makes teeth unattractive.
Removing FILM is important for beauty
and for health.
Get a tube of Pepsodent to-day. Note
how smooth and creamy it is. It is safe
. . . utterly safe ... on the softest baby
teeth and the most delicate enamel. Pep-
sodent is to-day’s outstanding scientific
tooth paste.

“Think it’s only that, eh?.... I’ve got
a duty to the public.”
“So have I —serving them over the
counter. You’ve already got rid of the
boy, and he won’t find it easy to land
another job round here.”
“A fat lot that troubles him! He can
lie on his back in the sun there and
watch other people work.”
“So that’s what’s on your mind, is it?”
“All these fellows can make a show
of being independent nowadays. Sus-
tenance waiting for them. Paid out of
our taxes.”
“I don’t see them growing chesty on
it.... You can’t put a brand on a boy
like that for a few shillings’ worth of
; groceries.”
“A few shillings! How do I know
what he’s taken? It’s most likely been
going on for months.”
“Yet you left him in charge of the
shop. Going off nearly every afternoon.”
The storekeeper’s smile had no humor
in it.
“Suppose it was my fault Vi was taken
bad, eh? Us married men.... I didn’t
suspect him till just lately. Took in like
a lot of people by that open look of his.
If I hadn’t set a.... If I hadn’t kept
my eyes open.... There were a few
lines of slow-moving stock that helped
me to catch him just, in time.”
They looked at one another closely,
an inner hostility hidden behind the
everyday friendliness of their guarded
eyes. Corder felt oppressed by something
vital in the woman, her quick, penetrating
glance, the swell of her full bust above
her belted waist. He had a memory of her
tripping across from the tea-shop with hot
meals under a starched serviette: it gave
a tinge of sourness to his mind. Trying
to mother everyone like that, old maid
that she was!
She had moved to the tray of vege-
tables in the window and was turning
them over.
“You’ve still got lettuce! They never
bring me any. I’ll have two of these —
no, three.... And take my advice —for-
get all that about young Verney. You’ll
be sorry unless you do.”
Back to the tea-shop she tripped,
brushing the windblown hair out of her
eyes with her free hand, and Corder
moved to the door, following the swing
of her plaid skirt, the twinkle of her
patent-leather shoes on the loose stones.
Waves of resentment flowed over him.
Why did she want to put her oar in,
mocking at his trips down to see Vi,
advising him how to treat young Verney?
A lot she knew about life! And for all
her amiable blarney, her worry about
whether he was getting enough to eat
now he had no one to cook for him,
she was taking away his custom, selling
chocolates and cigarettes over the
counter, encouraging people to drop in
for a chat on their way down to the post.
“You have been listening to a Bach
chorale arranged for the piano by Myra
Hess. Myra Hess. The time is now
fifteen minutes past four”....
Young Verney was bringing water up
from the creek in a bucket, his body
braced against the climb, one arm flung
out to keep his balance. Far behind the
youngster toddled, trailing a green bough,
and at the open fire by the tent-door a
slim, bedraggled girl bent over some
cooking-pots. Smoke curled up slowly
in the still air, gunpowder-blue against
the green. These people who lived for
the day only! They had no sense of
responsibility and no shame. Sprawling
in the sun, eating, sleeping, breeding;
taking for granted they would always
find enough cover against the cold,
enough food to fill their bellies. And no
thunderbolt from heaven struck them
down.
Where was there any justice in life
unless a man dealt it out himself, making
use of whatever power fell into his
hands?
From the corner came a dull click. As
if the spring had been released in him-
self Corder turned swiftly and hurried to
where the brown paper lay in a heap,
squatting down to grope in the darkness.
Yes ;no mistake this time! His fingers
touched something furry and warm; he
drew it out triumphantly. Pinpoints of
light flashed up at him; there was a
gleam of tiny, bared teeth ; but the copper
band had crashed securely on the restless
spine, and life only remained as an auto-
matic quiver in the flattened body.
A queer feeling of liberation, of relief,
surged up in the storekeeper. Some
tangle had been resolved in him, some
part of his will definitely asserted. For
a long time he remained still, staring at
the filmy forepaws, at the small, red bead
that had oozed on to the fragment of
clean pine. Then, as if responding to
a desperate appeal in the glazing eyes, he
muttered with brusque magnanimity:
“All right.... Yes, all right; I don’t
want any more palaver about it. I’m
satisfied to let it drop and give you
another chance. It was other people I
was thinking of, not myself alone. You’ve
had a bit of a lesson, anyway.”
Releasing the crushed scapegoat from
its metal band he took it out of the back
door and tossed it lightly on the ash-
heap.
Zarzoff.
BY CON DREW.
I 'M a pretty fair judge of a fighter, but
when it comes to figurin’ out what
them wrestlin’ fellers will do I admit
I’m only a numskull.
For instance, there was that Russian
grappler Zarzoff that me and Melbourne
Joe were managing in Sydney.
It was the time when wrestlin’ was
startin’ to boom, and there was prospects
of haulin’ down good money. Up till
then me and Melbourne had confined
our managing talents to fighters. We
went into the Adam’s-apple-squeezin’
game with our lamps shut, so to speak.
We came out of it with ’em wide open.
This chap Zarzoff was a 17-stone hip-
popotamus, with a chest and limbs like
a drayhorse. I’ve seen some strong men
in me time, but nothin’ to equal Zar-
zoff. His favorite pastimes were throwin’
2001 b. dumb-bells around and chokin’
wrestling partners. He all but strangled
the first partner we got him, and the
second retired with a neck like an open
concertina. The third stayed on; he
had stipulated that the play must be
light.
The only weak part of Zarzoff was his
head. We hadn’t had him a week when
one day he disappeared, and me and
Melbourne spent a busy afternoon
trackin’ him down. We found him in a
Dago’s shop in lower George-street
buyin’ lollies. He 'was a whale on lol-
lies. When he wasn’t eatin’ lollies he’d
spend hours on end lookin’ at pictures
in the papers.
One day he showed me a newspaper
picture of Kurnell, Botany Bay.
“Vot blace is dot?” he asks me.
“Kurnell,” I says.
“Gurnell?”
“Yes. The place where Cook landed.”
“H’m,” he grunts. “I deedn’t know
that Yeorge vas back from Eengland.”
That was Zarzoff all over. Thought
I was talking of George Cook the pug.
Well, me and Melbourne spent over a
month lickin’ Zarzoff into shape, and
then we thought it was time to match
him with someone. We found ourselves
facing a pretty stiff hurdle. Zarzoff
wasn’t too well known in Sydney, and
none of the grapplers would take him
on. They said he wouldn’t draw. “Let
him get a reputation,” they says. You
know the kind of stuff.
There was a bloke I knew called Sam
Stringer who was runnin’ a wrestlin’ hall
in Pyrmont. I thought he might come
to the rescue.
“H’m,” says Sam when I’d finished
my squeal. “It reads to me as if you
want me to stage a match with that
gorilla of yours and someone. Can he
wrastle?”
“He can,” I says.
“What I mean,” says Sam, “is can he
grab ’em quick and throw em’ heavy? I
ain’t got time for ring-around-the-rosey
grapplers.”
“He can grab them quick,” I says,
“and when he throws them they stay
where they’re thrown. If you’d seen
what he did to his wrestlin’ partners
you’d know that what I’m tellin’ you is
right.”
“Gymnasium bouts don’t count for
nothin’,” Sam come back. “When them
gymnasium gents, meet someone in a big
ring they generally lose their bearings
and go to pieces. Still, we might do
something with him. What weight is
he?”
“Seventeen stone,” I tells him.
“All beef?”
“No. All muscle. He’s the strongest
man I’ve seen.”
“H’m,” says Sam again. “Well, I
can’t put him on in a main bout because
all the dates are gone. I’ll try him out
in a prelim. One fall to settle it.”
We’re sittin’ at a table in a room Sam
called his office, and he picks up a type-
written sheet and looks it over.
“Would he be ready to wrastle a pre-
lim. to the Zico-Taylor bout on Satur-
day night week?” he asks me.
“He’d be ready to wrestle to-day,” I
come back.
“Right,” says Sam. “I’ll try him out
with The Snake. It ain’t much, but it
will give him a chance to show what he

Bank Interest Now
Lowest on Record
The rates of interest charged by the
trading banks on overdrafts are now
the lowest on record, and are con-
siderably below the rates charged
before the depression.
The rate of interest mainly depends on
the supplies of money available, the
demand that exists for that money, and
the risk involved in lending it.
When the public are cautious about
investing their money in commercial
enterprises, they lodge it with savings
and trading banks. The rate of interest
on deposits, therefore, falls as the
money in these institutions increases.
The banks, having more money to
lend, lower the rate they charge to
borrowers in order to increase the
demand for money.
Thus the banks do not arbitrarily fix
deposit and overdraft rates, both of
which rise or fall with changes in the
supply of, and demand for, money.

can do. If he beats The Snake I’ll
match him with a high-card grappler.
Now off you go—l’m busy.”
When I told Melbourne the news he
was as pleased as a cat with the pet
canary.
“We’re set,” he says. “It couldn’t
have happened better. All the big guns
in the wrestlin’ game will be there to
see the main bout, and they’ll get a feed
of what Zarzoff is like. We’re made.”
“We are,” says I, “if that yahoo of
ours don’t do some tomfool thing and
get hisself beat.”
Melbourne laughed. “What could he
do?” he asks.
“Search me,” says I. “A man with a
top-piece like Zarzoff is liable to do
anythin’.”
“He won’t do nothin’ silly,” says Mel-
bourne, “and he won’t get beat. I’ve
seen that Snake wrastle. He ain’t a
match for our bloke.”
“I hope he ain’t,” I come back ; and
I let it go at that.
That was Thursday. The following
Wednesday we eased Zarzoff up on his
trainin’. He only made one bad break
that week. Two days before the affray
he ate enough guavas to ballast a battle-
ship-scoffed them skins and all. It
didn’t bother him, because he had a
stomach like an ostrich.
He was as fit as hands could make
him on the night of the debate, and we
took him over to the hall and fixed him
up in his corner. Sam’s hall was well
in the boom in them days. The place
was packed. Close to the ringside I seen
a mob of newspaper blokes, and there
was two or three heads from the other
wrestlin’ halls come to see what was doin’
in the rival camp. It looked to me as
though we’d climb up a rung or two if
Zarzoff pulled the bout off.
After a bit The Snake strolled into
the ring. I had a feelin’ of trouble ahead
as soon as I seen him. He was two stone
lighter than Zarzoff, but he had them
beautiful silky muscles that you see on
a well-trained racehorse. He looked
like a man who could use his wits. He
was known to the talent as a crafty
grappler who had been a stumblin’-
block to many an aspirin’ mat artist, and
the crowd gave him a cheer as he went
over to his corner.
Just before they went in to bat Mel-
bourne leant across the ropes and says
to Zarzoff: “You take your time with
this feller, you hear? Keep on top of
him, but don’t do your block. When
you find he is startin’ to weaken give it
to him rough and often. You under-
stand?”
“I unnerstan’,” says Zarzoff.
“Well, see that you do what I’m tellin’
you,” says Melbourne, “and you’re sure
to beat this cove. If you win, Mr. Sam
Stringer, who runs this hall, will match
you with one of the big guns and put
you right in the game. Now, in you go,
and see that you don’t get led into a
trap.”
Sam needn’t have bothered to tell Zar-
zoff to take his time. The Snake
wouldn’t let him go easy. First crack
out of the box he made a dive at Zar-
zoff’s legs, and our bloke fell with a thud
that shook the buildin’.
I thought The Snake would climb on
top and try to pin him down, but he
just stood off and waited for Zarzoff to
get up. As soon as he got to his feet
The Snake repeated the act. Zarzoff
looked surprised.
In his gymnasium work-outs he had
been used to doin’ all the throwin’. This
was a new kind of grapplin’.
“It’s all right,” says Melbourne to me.
“The night’s young yet. It’ll be our turn
directly.”
The pair fooled round for a bit; then
The Snake made another dive for our
gorilla’s legs. He missed, and in a wink
Zarzoff grabbed him. Down they went
on the mat with The Snake underneath,
and there was a lively scramble while
Zarzoff tried for a headlock. He had
almost clamped it on when The Snake
wriggled out of danger.
“Ah ha!” says Melbourne. “I’ll bet
The Snake won’t want to mix it agen
for a bit.”
Melbourne was right for once. The
Snake was as game as a bantam, but it
was Zarzoff who was bein’ tried out, not
him. So when Zarzoff came lumberin’
towards him after they’d got to their
feet he back-pedalled out of reach. Twice
Zarzoff made a grab at him, but he
ducked out of danger each time. Then
he started as pretty a game of hide-and-
seek as you’d see in a ten days’ march.
Zarzoff tried most of his favorite
dodges, but The Snake was too cunnin’
for him. It was amazin’ how lightnin’
quick he was. A d,ozen times Zarzoff
seemed to be within an ace of securin’
a hold, and each time The Snake tricked
him and floated away. This went on
for about five minutes, and the crowd
begins to laugh.
“They’ll laugh on the wrong side of
their dials directly,” says Melbourne.
“Wait till Zarzoff gets a proper hold on
him.”
Just then The Snake, who was side-
steppin’ a corn-beef rush from our bloke,
slipped. Zarzoff shot out his gorilla paw
and grabbed him by the elbow. It
wasn’t much of a hold, but it was enough
for a man who had strength like Zarzoff.
With a sudden wrench he jerked The
Snake towards him and clamped on his
headlock.
I heard The Snake give a grunt as
Zarzoff dragged him to the mat, and I
knew that it was a case of now or never.
The Snake had fallen face down on
the mat, and Zarzoff started to lever him
on his back. Slowly The Snake went
over until one of his shoulders was touch-
in’ the mat; then Zarzoff applied the
downward pressure. I seen the muscles
on his back stand out like tightened
ropes as he called on all his terrible
strength, and The Snake’s friends yelled
to him to do a double roll.
They might as well have asked him
to do a back somersault over the build-
in’. Zarzoff had him dead to rights.
Seein’ that the end was near, the
referee stepped over and stood above the
grapplers to get a proper view of the
proceedin’s. By this time The Snake’s
two shoulders were almost touchin’ the
mat, and Melbourne lets loose a joyful
yell.
“They say that The Snake’s a quick-
thinker,” he yells. “Well, let him get
out of that.”
He did get out of it, and with amazin’
suddenness. Reachin’ his left arm over
Zarzoff’s back he slapped him hard on
the shoulder. Zarzoff thought the referee
had given him the fall. He eased up for
a second.
It cost him the match. Like a flash
The Snake slid from underneath. In
another wink he was on top of Zarzoff
and had pinned his shoulders to the mat.
It was done so quick that it left the
crowd gaspin’, and me and Melbourne
did a bit of gaspin’, too.
I didn’t say nothin’ to Melbourne,
though. There are times when conver-
sation don’t seem to fit in.
Mongrel Breed.
BY R. D. NETHERCOTE.
THURLY was whipping his dog when
Ravenna came trudging up the
road.
It was outside Thurly’s hut, and the
dog had crouched back against the wall
near the door in a pitiful attempt to
avoid the lash. Afraid to run away,
afraid even to howl, it whimpered and
shivered, lying flat on its belly and
shrinking back’ closer to the wall each time
the lash descended with a swinging swish.
Ravenna stood still in the red dust of
the road, hate in his brown eyes.
But he did not interfere. He himself
had been whipped by Thurly only the
day before.
Both Ravenna and Thurly were cane-
cutters, and both had been born and
bred in North Queensland. They had
never lived very far away from the sticky
heat of the canefields and the sugar mills.
Of both men sugarcane was an integral
part.
But there the resemblance between
them ended. Thurly was big, muscular,
brutal, the best canecutter for miles
around—as his season’s earnings proved.
Ravenna was of a leaner build. The
image of his Italian mother was set deep
in his dark eyes, but his Anglo-Saxon
paternity stood out in the cast of his
features and in the coloring of his skin.
He had never known his father, and had
taken his mother’s name.
His life had not been pleasant.
Avoided by both Italians and Australians
he had withdrawn into himself. Liquor
had sapped his strength. Lack of neces-
sity for keeping up appearances had
made him careless and lazy.
Now, as he stood in the road outside
Thurly’s hut, he was not a prepossessing
sight. He had not shaved for a week ;
his clothes were ragged, dirty, clumsily
patched ; his whole appearance was that
of a man gone to seed.
Thurly, whip-hand upflung, caught
sight of the watcher out of the sides of
his eyes. He lowered the whip and
turned round.
“So it’s Mr. Ravenna, eh?” he grinned.
“Come to apologise for startin’ that little
scrap yesterday?”
Ravenna did not answer.
“Of course, we was both a bit drunk,”
Thurly went on malevolently, “so maybe
I was as much to blame as you. That’s

a nasty cut I gave you over the eye.
Hope I didn’t knock out any teeth.”
Ravenna’s thoughts flickered back
dully to the previous day, when he had
fought with Thurly in the township.
They had been drinking in the same
hotel, and Thurly had taunted him
about his parentage. Had he been sober,
Ravenna would have taken the mis-
chievous insults in silence, but drink had
given him Dutch courage. Wildly he
had struck out at Thurly’s grinning face,
only to find Thurly playing with him,
cat-and-mouse fashion, finally and
cruelly knocking him unconscious.
He hated Thurly and all that Thurly
represented in. life. Yet even now, when
Thurly ..sneered, when Thurly’s whole
giant form seemed to radiate arrogant
contempt, Ravenna felt no urge to re-
taliate.
What was the use? He would only
be beaten into insensibility again.
A sudden gleam of ironic humor came
into Thurly’s eyes. He stretched out a
thick strong arm and grasped the shiver-
ing dog by the piece of rope which
served as collar.
“Here’s a dog for you, Ravenna!
He’s no good to me. Hasn’t got the guts
of a mosquito. Won’t fight a fox-terrier
six inches high. He’s no good to me —
Only a blasted nuisance. You can have
him. Ought to suit you.”
For the first time Ravenna spoke.
“Why were you flogging him?”
“For thievin’. He went and pinched a
leg of mutton I had inside the hut. That’s
all he’s good for, the yellow mongrel.”
Thurly aimed a vicious cut at the
•dog’s hindquarters. The animal cowered
back against Ravenna’s knees. Pity
stirred sluggishly within Ravenna. He
bent and stroked the dog’s head. A
warm tongue licked his hand.
“I’ll take him,” Ravenna said.
He took the dog by the collar and
gently urged him forward.
Thurly- stood and watched them go.
The , dog slunk along readily enough
behind Ravenna’s sagging, untidy figure.
Once the dog halted and looked back
at the big canecutter. Thurly quickly
raised his whip and held it menacingly.
The dog padded on forlornly behind
Ravenna.
Thurly thought it was all a great joke.
“Two mongrels.... two of a kind!”
he laughed.
Reaching his tin shack, Ravenna found
a hunk of meat and gave it to the dog.
Then he sat down and watched the
animal eat.
Obviously it was what is called in
the vernacular a “pure-bred mongrel.”
Ravenna thought he detected a strain of
dingo or wild dog in its appearance. But
to unravel all the tangled lines of its
ancestry would have been a task.
It was a big, lean, rangy animal, and
its predominant color was a reddish
brown. Ravenna contented himself with
naming it Red.
From that moment onward a curious
attachment grew between Ravenna and
Red. Both were more or less outcasts,
and the dog realised the fact as fully as
did the man. The contempt in which
the world held both was a bond between
them.
In the presence of other men Red’s
demeanor was furtive, cowed, slinking.
But when alone with Ravenna he would
hold his long-jawed head more erect, and
there would be a more self-assured light
in his eyes. It was as if he understood
that Ravenna could not righteously
judge another.
The dog made a great difference in
Ravenna’s life.. For the first time
Ravenna knew real companionship.
Riding home of an evening on one of
the flat-trucks behind the little “Puffing
Billy” which drew the cane from the
fields to the mill, Ravenna would see
Red waiting for him by the roadside.
As the midget train slowed to pant over
an incline the man would jump off, and
the dog would come galloping to meet
him.
Nights in the tin shack were not so
lonely now. Ravenna got into the habit
of talking to Red, and Red would lie on
the floor, head on forepaws, and look at
him with eyes that seemed to under-
stand.
On Sundays they would go for long
walks, mostly up into the scrub-covered
mountainside behind the mill. Red
delighted in chasing lizards and such
small creatures of the bush. Ravenna
would let him have his fun, but would
immediately call him off if in his excite-
ment he became brutal. Thus Red
learnt that small harmless animals might
be played with but must never be hurt.
One Saturday Red was not waiting by
the road when Ravenna sprang from the
cane-truck. Rather worried, Ravenna
hastened homeward. He was relieved to
hear Red growling to himself at the
back of the hut.
Red had caught a snake. Judging by
the mangled mass that had been its head
and neck, the creature was dead. But
Red had his teeth firmly buried in it
and was tossing it about on the ground.
As he stood watching, Ravenna sud-
denly realised that this was a changed
Red. When he had been owned by
Thurly the dog would never have dared
to attack a snake as long as this one.
Kindness had made all the difference
to Red. It had awakened a protective-
ness in him, a sort of instinct that com-
manded him to repel all invaders of
Ravenna’s property. Now Red had some-
thing of the aspect of a fighting dog.
When he went to bed that night
Ravenna’s mood was a mixture of pride
and regret. He was proud that Red
had shown an unexpected vein of cour-
age—and he was jealous because he him-
self had yet to show that vein of courage.
The following day, as they set out for
their usual Sunday excursion, they met
Thurly. It was the first time Ravenna
had seen him since the afternoon of
Red’s flogging. He and Thurly worked
on different parts of the canefields, and
since the half-hearted fight he had put
up against Thurly at the hotel he had
steered clear of the township.
Thurly planted himself in the middle
of the road and grinned from one to the
other. Thurly had a boy’s grin, and, his
great brawn notwithstanding, there was
much of the boy in his mischief-making
manner and in his unthinking brutality.
“What, playin’ nursemaid to that
mongrel, Ravenna? No self-respectin’
man’d take a cur like that out for a
walk.”
Ravenna, without answering, drew
aside to pass Thurly. But Thurly was
curious.
“Wonder if he’s still as yellow as he
used to be?” said Thurly, looking Red
over.
He was carrying a supple leaf-tipped
switch with which he had been lazily
dusting the flies from his immense
shoulders, and now he made a cut with
it at the dog.
Red snarled. The hair came up stiff
on his neck. His whole lean body was
suddenly tense.
Ravenna remembered the snake.
“Don’t tease him. You might be
sorry,” he said quietly.
Thurly looked up and laughed.
“Strike me dead, what do you think I
am to be scared of a mangy mongrel?”
And in a swift movement he brought
the switch down on Red’s back with a
decisive hiss.
Red crouched under the blow. Then
he leapt upward, teeth bared. His jaws
closed on Thurly’s wrist.
“Damn!” blazed Thurly.
His heavy boot caught Red in the belly
and sent him sprawling yards away.
Then something happened to Ravenna.
His face had grown dead-white, and his
brown eyes were flecked with red. His
lips drew back to utter an incoherent
sound, like the fighting snarl of a dog.
Then he leapt towards Thurly.
Thurly, doubly astonished, was taken
off his guard, and had to give ground
quickly. But in a moment he was grin-
ning with a devilish delight and using
his hard-boned fists in the manner which
had made his reputation known from
Bundaberg to Cairns.
Ravenna did not see the blow that
first felled him. Ravenna just found
himself on the ground, suddenly sober,
all that strange animal wildness knocked
out of him.
He did not want to fight any more.
Why not give in now and escape being
hurt? There was no audience ; he and
Thurly were alone on the road. No one
would witness his cowardice.
He saw Red a few feet away. The
dog was sitting up, forelegs straight and
tense, but the rest of his body twisted
sideways, crippled by Thurly’s kick. But
in the dog’s eyes was no sign of pain,
only a gleaming expectancy.
Red was watching, expecting! Red
would be the audience to his cowardice.
Abruptly Ravenna wanted Red to think
well of him. This new desire burnt up
into a madness in Ravenna’s brain. The
fire of it carried him to his feet and
sent him to the attack again.
The real fight began now, for Ravenna
found himself thinking, measuring, rea-
soning and not just hitting blindly. For
the first time he realised that Thurly’s
blows did not hurt him; they would
only start to hurt after the fight was
over. With that realisation all fear
dropped away, and Ravenna fought like
a remorseless machine.
Thurly knocked him down a second
time, a third time, a fourth time. But
always he came up again, and always he
came up wiser. He learnt to jerk his
head away from a flying fist; he learnt to
parry a blow on his arm without leaving
the arm numb ,to the shoulder ; he learnt
that Thurly’s jaw was hard as iron, but
.that Thurly did not like being hit on
the Adam’s apple or in the solar-plexus.
He learnt to concentrate on these two
weak spots until he had Thurly flounder-
ing for air, and he learnt to keep him
floundering for air until there was no
strength left in him to keep on flounder-
ing.
Ravenna stood over Thurly and looked
across at Red, who had regained the use
of his hind legs and was hobbling eagerly
forward.
“Thanks, Red,” he got out before
oblivion over him.
