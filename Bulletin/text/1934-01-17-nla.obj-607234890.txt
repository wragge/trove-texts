HIS
BOOKS
Genius
Biographies of famous artists all end,
consciously or otherwise, by stressing an
interesting truth. The “artistic tempera-
ment” is a misnomer; it is more likely
to be found in pugilists (a particularly
emotional lot), underworld queens and
the like than in great artists. The
supreme craftsmen—Titian and Rem-
brandt, Shakspeare and Milton, Balzac
and Dickens —only seem to have dif-
fered from their contemporaries in their
gifts. There is no reason to believe that
Shakspeare felt more deeply than his
Dark Lady; the difference was that,
being perhaps the most fully articulate
being who has ever lived, he found it
easier to express his emotions. Milton,
his sublime art apart, was a domestic
tyrant of a common type; Dickens
shared the habits and sentiments of the
middle-class Liberals of his day.
It would be hard to find three artists
more unlike on the surface than Beet-
hoven, Puccini and Nijinsky, whose bio-
graphies are reviewed below ; yet in the
essentials they were oddly alike. All
promiscuous, and all monogamous,
domesticated and sentimental at heart;
all friendly and all ready to quarrel with
their friends at the first pretext; all
petty-minded in everyday affairs; all
highly sensitive to criticism, however un-
informed. You can find men like them—
in everything but the strange kink which
we call genius—in any golf club.
Hopeless Quest
W. I. Turner’s Beethoven, which has
been republished by J. M. Dent and Sons
at 6s., is already a classic. The first book,
which occupies more than two-thirds of
the whole, deals with the Master’s life ;
the other three discuss his music, ideals
and the future of his art respectively.
The dominant note in this great man’s
character was, as in the case of the
least of us, the search for personal hap-
piness. He didn’t seek it, Christ-like, in
renunciation, and he was debarred by ill-
health and to an extent by his spiritual
nature from achieving it materialisti-
cally. “Sensual enjoyment,” he wrote in
his journal, “without a union of souls is
bestial and will always remain bestial.”
All women liked him, but few appear
to have loved him. He proposed to two,
and perhaps, also, to the Immortal Be-
loved whose identity has occasioned as
much argument as that of the Dark Lady.
The author thinks that “the abandon-
ment of Beethoven’s hope of marriage”
took place about 1812, when Amalie
Sebald refused him.
He had written, confidentially, years
before to his friend Amenda: “Know
that my noblest faculty, my sense of
hearing, has greatly deteriorated” ; but
it was not till 1817 that his deafness
became so bad that he could no longer
hear music. From then onwards his
troubles rapidly increased. His fame was
established, and he no doubt knew, if
the world didn’t, that he was an immor-
tal ; but ill-health and crowding financial
and domestic worries clouded every
triumph. Servants maddened him. He
wrote of one whom he had dismissed:
“The conscious criminal has got her sen-
tence to-day.” Of another: “The new
kitchenmaid made an ugly face when
asked to carry up wood, but I hope she
will remember that our Saviour dragged
His Cross to Golgotha.” His last illness
began early in 1828. “He seemed to
take it greatly to heart,” wrote his friend
Hummel, “that he had not married” ;
one of the many available proofs that he
never suffered from syphilis.
The Hummels were with him on March
24 when he asked for the viaticum. He
became unconscious shortly afterwards
and died on March 26.
A simple, pede-strian and at times
pathetic, even absurd, little man; yet, to
quote his biographer, “he will stand as
witness of how great it is possible to be,
and how far living artists have to .grow
before they are even visible by the side
of him.”
Film Hero
Puccini’s music
would have
stirred Beethoven
to scorn, as that
of Meyerbeer did
in 1814. (“There
is nothing in him,...I tell you he will
never amount to anything.”) Richard
Specht, whose Giacomo Puccini (Dent;
10s. 6d.) has just appeared, once wrote
and talked in something the same strain
of the composer of “Turandot.” Not that
he entirely approves of what he calls
Puccini’s “infatuating music” even now
The operas are “poster art,” full of
“crudities of the most brutal sort,” but
even Professor Hecht and many other
Teuton eclectics are disposed to admit at
this time of day that Puccini was a
Master, if only a minor one.
He had advantages which were denied
to Beethoven. Health; radiant good
looks ; the love of many women and of
one in particular to whom he always
returned after his infidelities; early suc-
cess, world-wide appreciation, and enough
money to gratify his whims. Unlike
Beethoven he hated cultivated society ;
his chosen friends were peasants. When
we read his letters
We are struck by their unintellectual quality,
and even commonness • of expression, not to
speak of a cheap, or at best free-and-easy,
delight in horseplay, worthier of the president
of a skittle club than of the master of a highly
individual art far removed from all that is
plebeian and hackneyed.
Puccini is an outstanding example of
the artist-philistine, but there have been
hundreds like him in pictorial art and in
literature as well as in music. He died
after an operation for cancer of the
throat, at the end of 1923—fortunate in
his death, as in all else. A long illness
such as Beethoven had to endure would
have been agony to this jolly sportsman,
who pined if he had to forego his shoot-
ing trips for any length of time.
A Great Dancer
In Nijinsky (Gollancz; 10s. 6d.)
Romola Nijinsky has written an amaz-
ingly brilliant life of her husband. She
is Hungarian, but there are no signs of
ither English vocabulary is immense,
and she has a sure sense of the value of
every word she uses.
She first saw Nijinsky dance when the
Imperial Russian Ballet came to Budapest
in 1912. It took her a long time to meet
him; he was guarded with desperate
jealousy by the formidable Diaghileff. In
the end she won and married him and
thereby drew down the unrelenting hatred
of Diaghileff on both of them.
She depicts Nijinsky as a choreo-
graphic genius with the mind of a boy.
Dancing was in his blood, but so, too,
was insanity. She implies that the perse-
cutions of Diaghileff and the business
worries which resulted from them has-
tened the end, but it was inevitable. He
suffered from schizzophrenia. Dancers
are like stage performers, their art dies
with them; and it is 14 years since
Nijinsky appeared in public. Yet “Faune”
is still remembered by thousands as the
most poetically beautiful spectacle they
ever witnessed.
Interesting lights are cast on Nijinsky’s
friends, and most of them emphasise what
may be called the moronism of genius.
Stravinsky surprised her.
He was dressed like a dandy, with the most
indescribable taste. He thought it was very
chic, and there was something touching in his
naivete and conceit.... He bitterly attacked
Beethoven, Bach and all those composers who
some years before he so respected, and now
were just “the Bodies.” _

The Astronauts
They have arrived and ask to be taken
seriously. Judging by David Lasser’s
The Conquest of Space (Hurst and
Blackett; Robertson and Mullens; Its.
6d.), there is no reason why they shouldn’t
be. According to Lasser, the day of the
fictioneers —the Poes, kernes and the rest
—amongst the planets is over. The scien-
tists’ truths are far stranger than fiction. •
There is an Interplanetary- Society in
the U.S.A., and there are several in
Europe. Scientists are devoting them-
selves to the study, of astrogation ; the
vasty deeps of space are being sounded,
the reefs and sandbars of the infinite

buoyed and beaconed, and the new cru-
sade into the astral Never-Never already
has its martyr—Max Valier, who was
blown up by a rocket, which is the
approved vehicle for solar exploration.
Plans and specifications have been
drawn up for the first space ship, whose
modest objective will be the moon
(240,000 miles), possibly as a jumping-off
place for Venus (26,000,000). The space
ship will be an immense steel projectile
propelled by rockets. It will pass through
the earth’s atmosphere at a speed low
enough to prevent incandescence and
thereafter, free from the earth’s influence,
will rush towards the moon at seven miles
a second. Various problems will have to
be surmounted, such as that a man’s
body will be four times heavier while he
is speeding through the air, and will have
no weight at all when out of the reach
of the finger of gravitation. He will have
to take his own oxygen with him. But it
is _ maintained that the difficulties of
sojourn on another planet are no more
insoluble than Mawson’s wintering in the
Antarctic: with fuels now available a
trip to the moon is perfectly feasible, and
if some new source of power is tapped,
such as the atom, Venus, which has an
atmosphere and may be inhabited, may
be attainable.
This may not be for another 100 years,
but in the meantime there are all sorts
of possibilities in the way of rocket trans-
port here on earth. Within ten years
rocket ships will be fired 30 miles into
the air from Berlin before breakfast, and,
travelling at a speed of 500 m.p.h. through
the almost frictionless stratosphere, will
descend at New York in time for their
passengers to have lunch at the Astor.
Another interesting suggestion is that the
earth should be supplied with another
satellite (or a dozen of them) in the shape
of a hermetically sealed tube. It will
be fired into space and will remain revolv-
ing round our planet, so that week-enders
may spend their holidays in the empyrean,
astronomers may study the heavens with-
out the interference of the atmosphere,
and meteorologists may take observa-
tions which will make droughts, hurri-
canes and other phenomena predictable.
The astronauts are nothing if not
optimistic. They visualise a time when
interplanetary trade and travel will be a
commonplace, and the music of the
spheres will be a sort of interplanetary
community singing.
The Conquest of Space is a fine piece
of writing, and the prophetic account of
an actual voyage to the moon is en-
thralling.
M. G. S.
Stevenson Interviewed
So much has been written lately about
R.L.S.’s visits to Sydney that some im-
pressions of the man as he appeared to
a Sydneyite in February, 1890, may be of
interest. It was his first visit, and he
had just stepped ashore from the German
steamer Liibeck, which in those days ran
between Apia and Sydney.
I was on the staff of the “S. M. Herald,”
and had been marked down in the assign-
ment book to interview the novelist.
Beyond reading “Treasure Island” and one
or two other books, I knew nothing about
him. His first sentence was ominous.
“I don’t like interviews. You had much
better write an article about me and my
writings.”
Still, he talked, and that was the one
thing essential. He impressed me as small
in frame, lithe and vigorous in action ;
still, in spite of his cosmopolitan training,
showing a trace of the Scotch accent; the
face was thin and careworn, the forehead
high, the eyes deep-set.
He looked weary and dishevelled, sur-
rounded by sea-borne luggage, and busy
with his wife settling down in a room
at the Metropole. He didn’t know at
the time that he was in a coffee palace.
Melbourne and Sydney were plastered
with pretentious temperance hotels at the
time, and the Metropole was one of them.
“We had better have a drink,” he said,
“before we start talking,” and forthwith
rang the bell. Climax. An explanatory
waiter and an enraged Stevenson. .
Later on he moved to the old Oxford
Hotel in King-street, and there I had
several lengthy talks with him. He spoke
of his indignation at the attacks upon
Father Damien’s reputation made by the
Rev. Dr. Hyde. “I am going to let this
scurrilous libeller have it hot,” he said.
He was as good as his word, for shortly
after he had the famous letter of defence
privately printed in Sydney.
One day I received a note asking me
to call. It was the privately printed letter,
which he asked me to have published in
the “Herald.” I replied that I was not the
editor, but had no doubt he would be
pleased to use it. I was wrong; the
“Herald” was frightened, but it appeared
later in the “Star”—an evening paper of
the period which subsequently became the
“Sun.”
Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne were
engaged upon a historical work dealing
with the Islands and the threatening politi-
cal situation there. This book subsequently
appeared as “A Footnote to History.”
The collaboration, Stevenson explained,
was not, as generally supposed, solely for
the purpose of obtaining the American
copyright, though it attained that end.
Those were the days of literary piracy in
the United States. Stevenson admitted
that he had lost a great deal of money
through literary thefts, and instanced
“Kidnapped.” Within a week of its issue,
25 separate editions were being sold
throughout the States at prices varying
from 10 to 25 cents. I remember coming
across a firm in San Francisco, at a later
date, which made a regular business of
pirating Kipling, and was bitterly
attacked by the author for doing so.
However, Stevenson’s publishers, Scrib-
ners, behaved generously; they paid
him considerable sums for his work, get-
ting in return the proof sheets, which
gave them a few days’ start of the pirates.
About that time a good deal of dis-
cussion had been going on. regarding the
license of modern novelists in sex matters,
and an artiole in the “New Review” on
“Candor in Fiction” gave me an oppor-
tunity of obtaining Stevenson’s personal
attitude.
“I have not read the article to which you
allude, but I gather that it deals with a phase
of the question which I hardly care to touch.
I do not in my own works like to trench on
dangerous ground, and prefer to have my writ-
ings as pure as possible. For instance, I would
not like to think that anyone read a novel
of mine on account of its pruriency, although
at the same time I do not approve of the Eng-
lish prudery of the present day. This false
sentiment, after all, is hardly a century old,
and we have only to turn to the works of
Richardson and Fielding to assure ourselves
of this. Their novels, which are now con-
sidered almost indecent, were looked upon as
quite proper and fit for general reading when
they were written. I fancy that we shall in
time change all this, and that the people will
eventually revert to the plain-speaking habits
of their ancestors.”
“But do you not consider that the modern
realistic author, such as Zola or George Moore,
with his ‘plain speaking,’ aims at attaining
this end?”
“No, certainly not, for he gives us an en-
tirely unreal and false picture of life, picking
out merely the blemishes of our modern civil-
isation, and exaggerating them as if they were
really expressions of the average type. Zola,
I consider, is a victim of sexual insanity. The
influence of this mania is prominent throughout
all his works, and he thus produces scenes and
characters which have no actual existence. I
may say,” and Stevenson, growing excited,
paced up and down the room, “that, familiar
as I am with the French life, I have never
seen anything to justify the brutality painted
by Zola. In ‘Le Reve’ we get the key to the
whole position, for there the author paints him-
self as the artist who is the principal character
in the book.”
“Then, taking realistic literature as a whole,
on which side do you consider the balance lies
—for good or for evil?”
“For evil, decidedly. Your average bour-
geois English shopkeeper gets hold of a work
of Zola’s and rubs his hands delightedly. ‘Ha,
ha,’ he cries, ‘here is something really indecent
at last. Never thought they would have allowed
anything like this to be published.’ And he
gloats over it. All he sees is the indecency,
and the fine lesson in humanity, or the warn-
ing against the continuance of social inequality
which the author intended to convey, is entirely
lost.”

Passers-by
Henry Boote, in As I Went By (Worker
Trustees), collects the verse of many
years, “written at irregular intervals dur-
ing a long and active journalistic life.”
His mood is most often that of the
traveller touching things seen with music,
a hurried traveller with only a little time
to pause for his spirit’s sake, and he is
at his best when the touch is light and
airy:
I love my love when she hangs out the clothes;
When on the line,
In weather all ashine,
With sleeves rolled up and standing on tiptoes,
She pegs out silken hose,
And shirts,
And skirts,
And socks.
And frocks,
And dainty laces,
And cute little braces,
And things that can only belong to the Graces.
And so on.
Faith in simplicity is Boote’s keynote,
in fact; all his verse has at heart the deep
strength of the bush, the home, the
garden, the kitchen, the laundry, the
earth.
The verse in The Oreti Anthology (The
Georgian Book Shop, Invercargill) is re-
printed from the “Southland Times.”
“Southerner” has the gift of the striking
phrase, but his verse as a whole exempli-
fies too often the verbal pretentiousness
as well as the careless haste of news-
paper work. Sometimes his thought is
worth while, as in
We shall remember you in days to come,
And take new heart and think of times long
gone;
And Death shall hold you in no silent land—•
No wall of earth shall bear your spirit down;
But you will beckon with an eager hand,
And raise your voice in laughter through the
town.
One judges from the phrasing and
some of the themes in this collection that
“Southerner” will sing better than this.
But there is some distance to go yet.

Appeal to Uncommon Sense
Does Jean Irwin (R.P. 27/12/’33) sug-
gest that there is an embargo on intellec-
tuals in Australia? If so, how is the
supply curtailed? Has any intellectual
ever been gaoled, extradited or slain here
because he was an intellectual?
No. The fact is we don’t produce
them. Further, there is no local demand
for them. We had what I might call a
quasi-intellectual in my unit during the
war. The C.O. hated him more than he
did the Boches.
But don’t let it be thought that intel-
lectuals flourish best amidst flattery,
press adulation and ballyhoo.. On the
contrary they appear generally in spite of
their environment.
Sex, love of power and love of life are
the three principal urges which animate
humanity, and because the man of brawn,
in any superlative degree, exhibits the
potentialities of all these he commands
the centre of the stage in the theatre of
human imagination. It may be foolish —
but aren’t we all?
The intellectual can write, paint or
play on these same themes, but he can
never command the same attention, be-
cause he is merely theorising. The man
of brawn is vital with life. He is any
woman’s potential lover, and he is power-
ful in the most effective way. All the
world over, in every age, the physical
type has lorded it over the mental type in
the human mind.
UNINTELLIGENTIUM.
A Protest
Strange that a literary magazine which
is in most respects progressive and up
to date should so pigheadedly cling to a
silly superstition. I refer to the well-
known criticism levelled by The Bulle-
tin at contributors who submit poems
containing, as rhymes, the wdrds “dawn,”
say, and “morn.” Has The Bulletin a
Scotch editor?
Dismiss, if you like, my contention
that it is only people of Scotch upbring-
ing who can make an /• sound before
a consonant, in English, natural.
Dismiss, too, as pedantry, the statement
that, according to standard English pro-
nunciation as recorded by the 1.P.A.,
“dawn” and “morn” would be spelt as
rhymes. I know that merely means
Oxford pronunciation, and it probably is
pedantry. Dismiss it.
But how many people of Australian or
even English upbringing do —I don’t say
can —pronounce that “r” in “morn,” or
the “r” in “shore” or the “r” in “mercy”
or the “r” in many another beautiful
word that is more beautiful with the “r”
pronounced? It’s not a question of what
could or should be done—language has
never bothered about that. The only
thing to be considered is what is done.
“R” in “morn” simply is not done. A pity,
perhaps. And there may be something
admirable in sticking out conservatively
for the good old customs, in putting your
back to the wall, and kicking against the
pricks. But the attitude if persisted in is
ridiculous. On a matter of principle,
or on a whim that is quite personal,
stand like a rock. But don’t force others
to accept your principles. Don’t make a
law for them of your whims—or even of
your passionate loves.
EUNICE HANGER.
A Satchel of Books
The “Daily Mail” Year Book, 1934
(Associated Newspapers, Ltd., London ;
Is. net), contains within its 274 pages an
astonishing amount of up-to-the-minute
information on a wide variety of subjects.
Killers and Their Prey, by C. T. Stone-
ham (Methuen and Co., Ltd.; 3s. 6d.), is
a collection of stories about African
beasts and their hunters written by one
who knows his subject. The tales are in-
teresting and instructive —only on one or
two occasions does the fact that they are
fictional thrust itself upon the reader—
but they have a certain sameness. One
of the most appealing is, peculiarly, not
about wild animals, but about a dog. It is
a book best read one or two stories at a
time, with longish breaks between.
The Prince of the Totem, by Tarlton
Rayment (Robertson and Mullens ; 65.).
Australian youngsters will find much that
is interesting in this story of the abo-
rigines. Tulkara’s Laughing Boy, Gor-ree,
who grows to be a leader of his mother’s
tribe, already has many friends among
the younger listeners to 3LO, and this
account of his adventures should bring
him many more. Binghi’s myths and
customs are told of with a sympathy that
has been often wanting in children’s
books on the subject. This one is illus-
trated by the author’s crayon drawings.

HIS TROUBLES!
“Premier Butler says South Australia will definitely oppose the granting of any further powers to the Commonwealth.”
“Dashed if I’LL help to set her free. I prefer to see her like that. Makes me feel more important.”

TAXES AND BUOYANCY.
When the worst of the depression struck
the world, no Anglo-Saxon country in a
developmental stage was more burdened
or worse governed for its money than
Australia. A group of Labor theorists
was in control at Canberra, sitting on a
narrow fence and dragged one way by
socialisation supporters and another by
inflationists. Political principle held
some members of the Ministry so loosely
that they were able without noticeable
effort or anguish to abandon their col-
leagues and their party at the height of
the crisis. The State with two-fifths of
the population surrendered itself to a
crowd that promised it the moon, and
gave instead tin hares, fruit-machines,
lotteries, a burst bank, a deficit of £5 a
head, 200,000 unemployed, default and
rebellion against Commonwealth laws.
Red and other “armies” glowered at
each other. The words “civil war” were
seen in print. An outside observer not
knowing his Australia would have said,
“Here is a country on the brink of ruin.”
Eighteen months have passed. The
country now has orderly, if stodgy, gov-
ernment ; out-of-works are getting jobs,
if not rapidly enough; Australian stocks
have climbed from a position on
the 20-per-cent.-discount line to a pre-
mium ; world confidence in us has so far
hardened that it has been possible to
cut interest rates on overseas loans by
25 p.c. The trade balance for five months
shows a surplus of £17,554,000 sterling.
Taxation has been reduced, and, thanks
in great measure to the Common-
wealth Bank Board, and to Loan Council
and Premiers’ Conference co-ordination,
it has been possible to tackle financial
problems in a national way.
Since 1928-29, Commonwealth and
State deficits have totalled (to June, 1933)
£53,374,573. But contributions to the
sinking funds have totalled £39,557,976.
Had it not been for the Premiers’ Plan
adjustments agreed on in June, 1931,
aggregate deficits for 1931-32 alone would
have been £41,000,000. At the end of
the present financial year there will be a
net deficiency on five years’ Australian
financing of £1,000,000 when aggregate
sinking-fund payments of £8,000,000 are
taken into account, if buoyancy does not
wipe it out, as well it might. At the same
time, Australia owes over £100,000,000
more than it did before the depression,
The obvious fillip which Australia now
needs is wise and widespread investment
which will make employment. With the
right kind of encouragement there is no
reason why industry should not expand
sufficiently to absorb every unemployed
worker in the Commonwealth. But the
right kind of encouragement it is not
getting. Even with cuts, Commonwealth
and States took £93,471,000 in taxation
for 1932-33 out of production valued at
£314,000,000 —almost 30 p.c. —against
£88,829,000 at the height of the boom out
of £447,805,000 —19.8 p.c. The rush for
lightly-taxed Federal loans has shown the
trend of investors’ thought, which is
further reflected in the fact that during
the 12 months to the end of September
the shrinkage of interest-bearing deposits
in the banks was only about 1.5 p.c.
The wool yield showed a decline in
quantity and quality. It needed a price of
£l2 17s. 3d. per bale to give us the same
return as in 1932-33 —£34,410,321. Actu-
ally, the average price for greasy and
scoured has worked out at £lB 17s. Bd.
per bale, or 14.7 d. per pound. The price
is still rising. Five months’ sales—in-
cluding two dead off-season months —
yielded £20,937,000 against £11,841,000
for the similar period last year. If exist-
ing conditions are maintained the return
for the year may be between £55,000,000
and £60,000,000, thus approaching the
best seasonal returns in history.
This unexpected gift of Providence
should have an effect on Government
finance. It, with the rest of Australia’s
export surplus, places London balances
in a highly-favorable position. At the
same time, if the money received passes
through its ordinary cycle and taxation
maintains its depression-time ratio to
the value of production, it will mean
that the Governments will receive an
unexpected £6,000,000 to £7,000,000 in
taxes from this year’s wool buoyancy—
though, of course, not actually in this
year’s collections, in view of averaging
provisions and other influences.
It is unthinkable that the Govern-
ments should have this perquisite to
spend. The matter calls for urgent atten-
tion by the Premiers when they meet on
February 16.
Of course, the full buoyancy will be
subject to the maintenance of exchange
rates. In the present condition of
London balances they are not likely to be
maintained. But even if exchange falls
there will still be price buoyancy, and if
anybody deserves the benefit of it it is the
struggling land man and business man
and worker, who have saved the Com-
monwealth in spite of the staggering load
of Governmental burdens which they have
had to carry.
Every day does something to prove the
urgency of The Bulletin’s demand for
a 50 per cent, reduction of taxes. It
should be made the primary issue at the
Premiers’ meeting, there decided upon,
and put into effect in supplementary
Budgets.
FOR THE BABIES.
“The Golden Christmas Box No. 25 ‘Art
Union,’ for the benefit of the babies of
St. Margaret’s Hospital,” was drawn last
week. This is another of the enter-
prises managed by Sydney’s biggest
charity-collecting-agency—the one re-
sponsible for the Community Hospital,
whose affairs have been discussed in The
Bulletin. The Golden Christmas Box
was bigger and better than previous “art
unions” run by the show. It had the
assistance of Mr. Whiddon, and Mr.
Whiddon’s picture, splashed (for the
babies’ benefit) across newspaper pages
and hoardings, has been a familiar sight
in Sydney for months. Mr. Whiddon is
in the lottery-share business in Sydney,
and is therefore famous, and presumably
affluent.
The collecting agency had paved the
way to success by an effort which helped
its other wards. This was called the N. S.
Wales Golden Chest, and some of its
beneficiaries had great personages for
patrons and vice-patrons. The Golden
Chest was to have been drawn on June
30, but the drawing did not occur till
August 17. Its prizes were advertised as
totalling £5260, which represents the sale
of 105,200 tickets at Is. The highest
number to win a prize was 1,197,596. If
all tickets below that were sold gross
revenue received from the public was
£59,879 18s. In other words, after pay-
ing out the prizes, the concern had
£54,619 to play with. It is to be hoped
it played well.
Perhaps tickets higher than 1,197,596
were sold and tickets lower than that
number were not in the drawing. The
public is entitled to exact information on
the subject. It might also warm the
hearts of ticket-buyers to know just how
much money was distributed to the Food
for Babies and other funds involved, and
in what manner and proportions. No
balance sheet has been published. Mr.
Stevens, who was much concerned about
The Bulletin’s criticism of Community
Hospital financial methods and ordered
an inquiry, might well see that a balance
sheet is forthcoming. He should certainly
give some attention to the recent inheri-
tance of the babies of St. Margaret’s.
The highest ticket to draw a prize in
“The Golden Christmas Box No. 25 ‘Art
Union’ ” was No. 1,439,359. If that was
the selling peak, tickets being Is. each,
the return was £71,967 195., less £6316
prize-money—£65,651 19s. The foregoing
remarks regarding tickets above and
below the highest number to draw a
prize apply in this case also. It might
be suggested reasonably that an audited
balance sheet of “The Golden Christmas
Box No. 25 ‘Art Union’ ” should be pub-
lished within 30 days. Hitherto, St. Mar-
garet’s has shown a certain coyness in
taking the public into its confidence about
collection details. Its last balance sheet
indicates that it received several thousand
round pounds from the efforts of a
“special committee,” unnamed, which
organised dances, “art unions” and the
like without any indication of expenses
or even the names of the functions by
which the money was raised, though
donations of £lO3 from individual
members of the public are itemised to the
last shilling. In common justice to the
eminent persons whose names appear on
the committees of these institutions, as
well as to the public, precise and detailed
information should be promptly fur-
nished.
There is a strong suspicion, which may
be right or may be wrong, that the
Attorney-General’s regulations in regard
to “art unions” are honored more in
the breach than the observance. If it
is advisable that a small group of hospi-
tals not in the first rank should be
allowed to raise by “art unions” a sum
equal to 2s. per head of the population
of Sydney and suburbs, very strict regu-
lations should govern both the raising and
spending.
These overgrown gambles are another
sign that an effective Charities Act is
long overdue in N. S. Wales.
TEN THOUSAND MILLION
DOLLARS.
Another instalment of the Roosevelt
Plan has been announced in a message
to Congress. In an effort to overtake
prosperity, which the Americans told
themselves for three years was “just
around the corner,” the President is to
borrow ten thousand million dollars
before the end of June. Part of this pro-
digious sum is for the repayment of debts
already incurred in the pursuit of pros-
perity ; part is for things like “agricul-
tural adjustments,” “conservation of
crops” and “finance reconstruction,”
whatever those high-sounding words may
mean; the bulk is for public works.
The Roosevelt Government is budgeting
for a deficit of 7000 million dollars this
year and anticipates that the public debt at
the end of June, 1935, will have increased
from 23,813 million dollars to 31,423
million dollars. It was 26,593 million
dollars during the war and has been down
to 16,185 million dollars since.
In breaking the news about the ten
thousand million dollars, the President
described himself as “laying the founda-
tions of confidence in the present and faith
in the future.” In another flight of fancy
he saw himself setting in motion “cumu-
lative beneficial forces which will return
in an increased volume of business, more
general profit, greater employment,
diminution of relief expenditures and
larger Governmental receipts and repay-
ments.” His proposals have staggered
Wall-street and Threadneedle-street and
dazzled Australian Labor leaders and
newspapers. Mr. Lang’s newspaper hails
him as another Lincoln.
The main part of the programme has
been tried in Britain and Australia.
Britain’s experiment was brief but suffi-
cient. It laid out £100,000,000 sterling on
works to “absorb the unemployed,” and
found that for every £1,000,000 spent
only 4000 unemployed were “absorbed”
—2OOO directly and 2000 indirectly—and
that only for a time. When the
£100,000,000 had been exhausted it
abandoned the policy, and its President
of the Board of Trade said very definitely
a few months ago that his Government
would not think of reviving it. Aus-
tralia’s experience has been longer and
worse.
During the 10 years 1919-1929 the six
State Governments alone borrowed and
spent £330,000,000, chiefly for public
works, which regularly failed to yield the
interest on the loans. During the same
10 years State revenue from taxation
rose from £14,291,600 to £32,525,800, a
large part of the increase going to meet
the interest deficiency. There were mas-
sive annual deficits withal. In time Gov-
ernments took to floating loans to pay
interest on existing loans, and floating
more loans to appease the clamor of the
vast army of casual laborers whom the
system bred.
In 1930 borrowing ceased because
lenders had grown shy. The leader
of the noisiest party in the most
populous State undertook to set it going
again, telling his followers that he
could get all the millions he wanted from
“the money-choked markets of Britain
and America,” or “from our own cap-
able and willing people.” In fact, he
made much the same promises to the
people of New South Wales as Mr.
Roosevelt is making to the Americans.
Given the opportunity to redeem them,
he failed to get a red cent from the
money-choked markets” aforesaid and
“our own capable and willing people were
equally unaccommodating. Within four
months he was shouting that the British
bondholders were Shylocks and could
whistle for their interest until they
reduced it to 3 p.c. While cheating
them he paid the Americans. But the
favors evidently anticipated were not
forthcoming, and before the end of the
chapter he was defaulting to all and
sundry.
J. M. Keynes, the economist, is one ot
Mr. Roosevelt’s admirers. He is sure
that a vast programme of Government
borrowing and spending must be crowned
with success. Any Australian Auditor-
General could tell him that it is an easy
road to national bankruptcy ; any Aus-
tralian citizen with a sense of responsi-
bility, that it may lead to even greater
dangers and calamities. If America is to
escape what Australia has endured it
will need all the luck in the world.
THE WILD THINGS.
Australia’s fauna, as The Bulletin has
remarked, is unique. So, too, is much of
its flora; and much of both is in
danger of extinction. This has long been
evident to thoughtful observers, whose
efforts in N. S. Wales have borne legis-
lative fruit in such measures as the Birds
and Animals’ Protection Act, the Wild
Flowers and Native Plants’ Protection
Act and the Bush Fires Act. Under all
of these Acts provision is made fof the
appointment of rangers, and during the
past decade there has grown up a power-
ful body of honorary rangers, imbued
with the single-minded purpose of pro-
tecting and preserving our native birds,
animals, plants, flowers and trees.
At first the honorary ranger worked as
a freelance, with the co-operation —when
he could obtain it —of the police ; but it
soon became evident that the freelance
was incapable of dealing with vandals
and lawbreakers. Accordingly, some four
years ago a body of active honorary
rangers banded together under the name
of the Rangers’ League.
Recognising the great power of public
opinion, the Rangers’ League early began
a campaign to mould it so that the
public should not merely decry but refuse
to tolerate the continued wilful destruc-
tion of flora and fauna. Hence, among
other things, the Bushland Exhibition, held
annually in a large Sydney store. The
total number of visitors to the first, which
ran for five days, was exceeded by one
day’s tally at the third.
That the need for protection is not
based on sentiment alone is emphasised
by a Riverina ranger, who wrote to the
League urging it to work for the closer
co-operation of the N.S.W. and Vic.
authorities in relation to open seasons for
wild duck. Apart from the inability of
protected birds to read proclamations
and their unfortunate habit of breeding
at such times as to provide families of
helpless fledglings to be orphaned on the
opening day of the “open season,” many
ducks have been shot on the N.S.W.
side of the Murray during a N.S.W.
“close season,” but ostensibly on the Vic-
torian side, and vice versa.
The wild duck feeds on the water-snail,
which in a certain stage of its develop-
ment provides an abiding-place for the
fluke —that great and insidious enemy of
our flocks. If the duck is killed off the
water-snail will flourish unchecked, and
so will the fluke.
The Bulletin has suggested that pro-
tection of fauna should be made a
Federal matter. The Rangers’ League,
long handicapped by divided control
even within the boundaries of N.S.W.
(one of the Acts mentioned is adminis-
tered by the Chief Secretary’s department
and the others by Local Government),
convened a conference of 40 organisa-
tions interested in the preservation and
protection of fauna and flora, which
recommended co-ordination of the
administration under one head. A com-
mittee has since been in communication
with the Chief Secretary; one result,
it is hoped, will be a Flora Protection
Act which will declare all flowers, trees
and plants protected, except (as in the B.
and A.P. Act) certain scheduled plants,
with power reserved to the Minister to
add to the schedule from time to time.
Meanwhile, let the public be assured
that Australian fauna and flora are not
without active friends, who are glad to
know that The Bulletin is now, as ever,
with them.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Forrest’s Work Goes On.
The men of the ’nineties —John Forrest,
above all—wrought well for Westralia
when they made public borrowing con-
ditional on a rogue- and fool-proof sink-
ing fund being tacked on to every loan.
Smaller men who came after reduced
the annual sinking-fund contribution, and
others drifted into the habit of borrowing
the equivalent; but even this was a long
way better than doing without a sinking
fund—the shiftless fashion of Govern-
ments in other parts of Australia, especi-
ally New South Wales.
A Westralian 4 p.c. loan of just under
a million fell due in London the other
day. It has been repaid out of the sink-
ing fund accumulated during 40 years.
There was enough to meet it before the
State debts passed under Commonwealth
control in 1928. But the annual pay-
ments were continued, and there is a
surplus for the general loan redemption
fund.
Another wise provision made by the
men of the ’nineties was that sinking
funds in respect of London flotations
should be kept in London. They, of
course, did not foresee that the exchange
rate would one day be 25 p.c. against
Australia, but the effect in this case has
been the same as if they had foreseen it.
When the loan was paid off exchange
had not to be added.
Another conversion loan is to be
placed on the London market in a few
weeks. It could have no happier pre-
cursor than the redemption of this West-
ralian loan out of the savings, shrewdly
invested, of the Westralian people. Honest
finance always returns dividends, even if
the dividends are deferred.

Exchange.
The splendid recovery in wool prices
brought about an increase of £10,852,000
(sterling) in our exports during the five
months to the end of November.
Imports were £1,543,000 less, and the
surplus of exports, including bullion and
specie, was £12,395,000 greater at
£17,554,000 sterling.
This comparative prosperity, neverthe-
less, has its worry for Governments and
banks. The worry is exchange. Twelve
months ago the problem was whether to
raise the tariff or the exchange in order
to stem the flood of imports that threat-
ened to deprive us of the wherewithal to
pay our overseas interest. Now the ques-
tion is whether the banks will take the
risk of paying the exporter £125 Austra-
lian for every £lOO in London when there
is a possibility that the outside market
will supply the importer with London
money at less than £125. That is in view
of the anticipated substantial surplus of
exports this year.
Unless seasons or prices affect our
export values soon, an adjustment in the
exchange or the tariff seems inevitable.
Unfortunately, though the woolgrower
would now be much better off than last
year even if the exchange dropped to
£ 115 or par, the wheat-farmer, notwith-
standing that he receives £125 Australian
for every £lOO his produce realises in
London, is still in a critical position;
and so is the dairy-farmer. Nevertheless,
secondary industries must not be made
the scapegoat by wholesale revision of
the tariff to encourage imports.
If local employment is to be stimulated
our imports should be no greater than is
necessary to maintain harmonious rela-
tions with those to whom we sell, and to
maintain also a reasonable internal nrice-
level.
4
Commissioners and Trade.
The N.S.W. Government will not appoint
another Agent-General in London. His
place is to be taken by a Trade Commis-
sioner, who leaves Sydney to begin work
next March. Whether the scheme is a
good one depends on the line of action
pursued. If the officer is to be merely one
more publicity man raving about golden
fields, boundless opportunities and the
super-excellence of Australian produce,
and writing home occasionally to say
what wonderful work he is doing, then
Mr. Stevens need not waste his money.
In the man chosen for the job there!
is hope. Queensland-born, financially
trained, director of a big business, young,
travelled, with a N. S. Wales knowledge
gained through holding office in the
Sydney Chamber of Commerce, Mr.
Heath is essentially the type that a
business house might send to look after
important affairs in a distant country.
If he can establish liaison with British
ports which cry out for Australian
produce and establish continuity of
supply in their areas ; if he can persuade
N. S. Wales land men to standardise their
produce and to meet the market instead
of expecting the market to meet them;
if he can open up .the bacon trade which
should be waiting for us, clarify the
difficulties of the fruit situation, and set
a standard for fat-lamb export —or any
one of these things—he will pay his way,
and Britain, sick of splurge and boost,
will welcome him.
Mr. Heath, too, should be useful to
the Commonwealth, if the State does not
guard his operations too closely. He
was, in 1932, chairman of the commis-
sion which inquired into Australian rail-
way affairs for the Federal Government,
and recently he acted for Australian
Chambers of Commerce at several inter-
national meetings. He is personally on
good terms with Mr. Bruce, who would
be in a much stronger position and freer
from details if the State representatives
were practical specialists in various
branches of trade and commerce.
The time must and should come when
the whole of Australia’s representation
in London will be co-ordinated in Com-
monwealth hands. In the interim, while
the States insist on separate representa-
tion, it is better that worn-out politicians
in the guise of petty ambassadors, who
are now their emissaries where Agencies-
General still exist, should be replaced
by business men entrusted with the carry-
ing out of a specific trade-development
programme. The less political interfer-
ence with them, too, the better.

The Stavisky Affair.
Politics and finance are so closely con-
nected in France that when a bank sus-
pends payment or a company calls in
the liquidator the Government trembles.
Since the days of the First Republic
the country has had a weakness for
banker-politicians and politicians who are
friendly—sometimes too friendly—with
bankers. “Members of Parliament,” a
cynical historian has written, “are fre-
quently of slender means: small shop-
keepers, small landowners, members of
the liberal professions.”
A candidate is elected. He comes to Paris,
where his salary only enables him to live on a
very modest scale. He becomes a Minister for a
period which he knows is bound to be fairly
short. His salary is raised, but his expenses are
increased in proportion.... But as a deputy,
a member of commissions, a Minister, he has
to deal with matters which run into millions,
perhaps hundreds of millions. And if he is
the least bit weak or inclined to yield to temp-
tation, the inducements held out to him are
frequently overpowering.
Hence the politico-financial scandal
which periodically shakes the Republic
and moves Royalists and Reds to unite
in denouncing the thieving dogs of
bourgeois Republicans and staging riots
in Paris. The Stavisky affair is the
latest.
Stavisky was a Russian, naturalised in
France. Though a common swindler
who had served a sentence, and though
awaiting trial on another charge he
managed to become director of the
Bayonne municipal bank, and in that
capacity to issue forged bonds with a face
value of £6,000,000. These he planted
on accommodating insurance cos. The
hearing of the charge against him was
adjourned nineteen times. In the end he
bolted to Chamounix, where, after some
mysterious manoeuvres in a chalet, police
bore him, dying, to a hospital. “Shot
himself in the head,” was the official
report. “Shot by the police, so that he
wouldn’t split on corrupt Ministers,
deputies, magistrates, newspapermen and
policemen,” shout the two wings of the
Opposition ; and evidently a great many
Frenchmen who are neither Reds nor
Royalists believe them.
It seems a smaller edition of the
Panama Canal affair. In that case also
there was a shady naturalised foreigner,
the Baron de Reinach, who, accused of
having squared Ministers, deputies, mem-
bers of commissions and editors, “died
suddenly in such mysterious circum-
stances that everybody said he had com-
mitted suicide.” The Royalists raged
then as now; it was said that a certain
ex-Minister alone had received £16,000 —
the precise amount alleged to have been
“received by the deputy Proust from
Stavisky for propaganda.” Accusa-
tions were made against a hundred mem-
bers of the Chamber. One of them was
Clemenceau. He defended himself
vigorously, but he quitted Parliament
under a cloud, was out of it for nine
years, and found his accusers still active
20 years later when he tried to become
President.

The Crime of Work.
N.S.W. Breadcarters’ Union’s Christ-
mas box to the bakers of Wollongong
consisted of pieces of blue paper. One
employer accepted the offer of a hand
who wished to start work an hour or so
earlier than usual one morning to cope
with the Christmas rush. Both were
fined for their dastardly act of goodwill.
The employer’s penalty was £lO, the
minimum—the Bench couldn’t help
itself.
Another alleged villain who had been
working 24 hours round to supply his
customers was caught baking at 12.15
a.m. by the union secretary, who must
have been working at 12.15 a.m. as well
as the baker. The Bench asked the u.s.
what would happen if a town were
threatened by bread shortage, and got
the reply that people then could bake
dampers and scones.
McCulloch, S.M., said that it was
about time the Legislature had something
to say. So it is. Sweating is an abomina-
tion, but so is a system which compels
labor to regard itself as a piece of
machinery, switched on at one definite
hour and compulsorily switched off at
another.
Workers should have the option of
keeping minimum hours, but \vhere en-
thusiasm or necessity impels a willing
employee to help a good wage-payer out
of a hole in time of stress, it is iniquitous
that any agitator should have the power
to haul him before a Court. Australia
was built up by the hard work of pioneers,
and the heritage which they left us can
be only maintained by more hard work.
The day’s toil is not something to be
dreaded, like a visit to the dentist, yet
that appears to be the extreme conclusion
which many union secretaries have
reached. It is a nation-destroying fetich.

The Australian Horseman.
“Circle Dot” replies:
I don’t know “Second Divvy,” but I know
Mick Bruxner. He was born in the cattle
country at the head of the Clarence; he has
seen the cavalry of the world as a soldier and
the horsemen of England in peace-time, and he
owns a pastoral property in the New England
foothills on the Queensland border; so he
should know what he is talking about.
I also have seen horsemen of other coun-
tries, notably in S. Africa and Europe, and have
spent years of my life among the bush people,
from the Murray to the Gulf; and Bruxner’s
verdict is mine. For percentage of horsemen
to population, the Australian is still “the best
horseman in the world.”
It is ridiculous to compare the pick of the
trained cavalry and hunting men of Britain and
Ireland, a mere .fraction of the population, with
the whole people of Australia. In any country
town I pass through (I am a cattle drover) I
can pick up men and lads whom I can put on
any horse in my plant of over 30. Any of
my men can do his day’s work and get his
horse —a grass-fed one, usually not in good
condition —“safely and expeditiously over a
country,” at times covering anything up to 50
miles in the day, to report to a distant station
and get back to the night camp.
As for the training and management of
horses, we have scattered through Australia
camp horses trained to draft one beast from
the middle of a mob of restless bullocks in
a manner which almost contradicts the scientific
statement that animals can think but cannot
reason. They will keep it up for hours with-
out making a mistake. Also consider the
Ashton brothers, who schooled their polo ponies
to the English standard and sold them amongst
the world’s keenest players.
“Second Divvy” mentions steeplechasing.
Organised fox-hunting is the nursery of it, and
we have never had much of that anywhere. All
the same, Corrigan, Regan and Mooney and
(among the amateurs) Inglis and Cox would
have shone over the jumps in any part of the
world; and in flat-racing, Frank Wootton, Bul-
lock, Carslake, Sibbritt and Johnstone have
held their own with the best jockeys in Europe.
The only three Englishmen I ever employed
with credentials as horsemen were an ex-
Dragoon sergeant and two young fellows who
had done the average pleasure-riding and some
hunting. None of the three could be trusted
on anything but a very quiet horse. The only
Englishman I evef saw to be classed with an
Australian bush rider was Harry Morant, “The
Breaker” of old Bulletin days.
On my last- trip from Queensland a station
bullock followed our mob and joined it night
after night for a week. The last day on the
run the station stockman who was piloting
us cut him out half a mile north of the boun-
dary. The country was thick bull-oak and
wattle scrub. Racing the bullock off the mob,
he jambed his stockhorse on to him just as
the bullock jumped a fallen tree about four
feet high. As they landed he threw the bul-
lock and, lighting on his feet, simultaneously
pulled the bull strap from round his shoulders,
jumped on the bullock’s rump, and strapped
him down by the two hind legs. The only
comment was drawled by one of my lads, not
on the skill or pluck of the man—that was
in the ordinary day’s work —no: “Cripes, that
horse ought to make a jumper.” Probably a
“consummate horseman” from Islington or
New York could have done it quite as easily,
but I doubt it.
«
These Garments.
The clothes question has had a great run
during the silly season. Melbourne banks
rose in their wrath against employees who
strolled about in working hours without
hats, to the detriment of their dignity.
It was almost as if the spacious old days
when “S. M. Herald” reporters, under
regulation, wore silk toppers and cutaway
coats had returned.
Then Central Queensland papers an-
nounced that Mr. F. M. Forde had
“acquired a lion skin” ; but Ft was a false
alarm. Leo’s cast-off, Leo having ex-
pired, is to clothe the Forde floor ; the
ex-Customs Minister will continue to go
dressed in the off-cut of the- lamb
Finally came the young Diana of
Melbourne. On New Year’s Eve she
arrived outside a Chinese shop whither'
she and married friends had driven to buy
“dim sims.” An astonished constable
declared afterwards in court that the
lady was standing in the dicky-seat of
a car garbed in pantalettes (not four inches
wide anywhere) and a brassiere, blowing
a toy trumpet. She and her friends de- 1
dared that she wore shorts, brassiere and
sports coat. And she wasn’t blowing the’
trumpet —it wouldn’t blow.
So indignant was the man of the party
that he resisted the police and was fined
£2, but the magistrate dismissed the case
against the girl, remarking that she was
“immodestly” but not “indecently” clad.
Then she let herself go with all the vigor
and indignation of 21: *
I have the satisfaction of knowing that, as
a result of the painful and embarrassing experi-
ence that I have been through, no other girl,
here or elsewhere, is likely to be arrested by
an officious policeman for appearing in the
streets in what is, after all, quite ordinary
modern attire.... I feel that official approval
has been given to a garb which i 5.... in keeps
ing with the spirit of the times. ,
The lady is a dressmaker, and is a white
Australian. While a sports coat, worn
open in front, a brassiere and shorts (vide
newspaper pictures) may even become
the costume of policemen in the
near future, the vicinity of a Chinese
restaurant is hardly a suitable venue in
which to exhibit them. Certain Celestials
have been doing a roaring import trade
in photographic goods, nudes and near-
nudes. In China a brassiere is not con-
sidered a sufficient garment for a school-
girl ; and the stability of our relations
with Asia largely depends on Oriental
respect for us, which this sort of non-
sense helps to kill.
Moreover, the young reformer is under
an illusion.
Let her parade her costume in the
average Australian country town and see
what the police and a rural Bench will
do to her!

Adolf at Work.
Adolf Hitler does not lack nerve, but
he lacks a knowledge of Anglo-Saxon
psychology. He is flooding the world with
leaflets, one of which embodies hife
Nuremburg address to the German
people, delivered last October. It might
have been written in a wild moment by
the Kaiser or Little Willie. For example:
Never has a conquered nation so earnestly
striven to help heal the wounds of its former
enemies as did the German nation in the long
years in which it fulfilled the conditions which
had been imposed upon it.
In other words, with the help of inflation,
borrowing based on threats of European
chaos and other devices, the country for
years kept its dear enemies in a state of
financial uncertainty, while German com-
mercial travellers were engaged in a vast
world-wide undercutting campaign which
savored of anything but brotherly love.
Believing that their former enemies would
fulfil their part of treaty obligations, the Ger-
man people honored their side of the bargain
with almost fanatical sincerity.
Their first act was the sinking of the
German fleet in Scapa Flow in defiance
of Armistice arrangements. The Ger-
mans did not carry out any other cardinal
portions of the treaty except under duress,
and the only Chancellor who showed a
reasonable attitude was Stresemann, who
is dead.
Side by side with Adolf’s own trucu-
lent efforts, his official leagues carry on
a world-wide propaganda. The products
of the Fichte-Bund of Hamburg are
typical. One of this body’s pamphlets is
headed “The Destroyers of International
Goodwill Unmasked,” and begins:
The British and American public hardly
realise how • shamelessly they are misled and
deceived.
Follows a tirade against the British press
and an accusation that a British Foreign
Office official was guilty of “a typical
example of how lies about atrocities are
invented.” The leaflet ends with an
emblem showing a mailed hand gripping
a spear which it is thrusting into the
mouth of a crocodile or dragon or some-
thing, and the words “Away with Ver-
sailles.”
There is one test of Hitlerite goodwill.
Let some Australian or British propa-
gandist try to print in Germany about
Hitler and his officials the sort of thing
which Hitler’s agents are saying about
British institutions and personalities in
their international pamphlets and see
whether he can stand criticism on his own
dunghill.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Erua”: The rumor was going round
the district that Tawhiti had been ill-
treating Eketere, his wahine, and we felt
it our duty to mention it. Tawhiti was
righteously indignant. “I te kood hus-
pand,” he assured us: “Eketere te pig
liar.” But the report had come from a
reliable source, to wit, one Roka, a rela-
tive, and we pressed for details. “Werra,”
said Tawhiti, waxing confidential, “I
preak te pig jug and Eketere say I te
rough proke. Ten I kick Eketere make
her see I not te rough proke. Ten Roka
kick me, and ten Eketere kick Roka.
Ten Roka kick Eketere”.... But we
gave it up at this point and invited
Tawhiti to have a beer.

“Cam H.”: I never knew a military
officer confused about right or left (B.
3/1 / ’34), but I once saw one bewildered
about front or back. It was before the
war, when senior cadet uniforms were
first issued, and were regarded as a puzzle
by raw recruits. One bright lad in our
company, who lived out of town, turned
up for parade with his pants vice versa,
so to speak. The officer didn’t notice it
until he had given the ’bout-turn order ;
his look of utter amazement as he gazed
at a la v d who had turned, apparently,
inside his pants is still vivid in my
memory.
“What would you say Minnie’s best line was?”
“The one of least resistance.”
“Hamer”: I came away from the
Highland sports meeting with a convic-
tion that it was one of the most inter-
esting affairs it is possible to attend.
Jones, who claims to be Scotch, had the
free tickets. The first thing that intrigued
me was a well-contested footrace, but
before I could make out who was win-
ning a fellow going over the hurdles and
a chap tossing a shot successively inter-
fered with my line of vision, and before
the shot fell Jones asked me to have a
drink. I paid for ifc, because he was so
long fumbling in his pockets, and then
another enthusiastic Scot named Brown
hunted us out to see his granddaughter,
Molly Murphy, dance in the Highland
fling contest, which would no doubt have
been good if my attention hadn’t been
partially distracted by a bicycle race and
a chap doing a high jump. I was search-
ing the official programme to sort
matters out, without getting much infor-
mation except that somebody’s gin was
good for the kidneys, when Jones sug-
gested another drink. Brown paid this
time, followed by Hodge, another braw
Hielander, who had joined our party. The
subsequent proceedings were equally
mixed, but it seemed to me that the most
exciting incidents of the day occurred
when I artlessly asked why the tall man
in Highland garb was talking Chinese
and when Jones, after suggesting drinks
at least a dozen times, Very nearly paid
for one. lam convinced at last that
Jones is a Scotchman.
“Borderer”: One individual I saw on
his way to the Highland gathering in
Sydney particularly impressed me. He
wore a regulation woollen kilt of the
Mackenzie tartan. As a plaid he had
donned a wide strip of silk showing the
excruciating color-clash of what is known
as the “Royal Stewart,” though it was
really invented for Queen Victoria and
used to be familiarly referred to by the
ribald as “the McGuelph tartan.” As
I gazed on the apparition I could almost
hear the manes of Rob Roy, Cluny Mac-
pherson, Keppoch and Glengarry howling
savagely in Tartarus.

“L. 1.8.”: “Marsh’s” 'statement (B.
10/1 /’34) that he never noticed any
cholera warnings from the retreating
enemy during the Sinai-Palestine cam-
paign may have been due to his lack of
observation. In the big palm grove at
Bir-el-Abd, to quote only one instance,
I saw them nailed to the palm trunks. It
is, of course, possible, however, that the
wooden boards had been pinched for
boiling dixies before “Marsh” came on
the scene. As to the well-poisoning story,
it was told on every front from the out-
break of the war, though there was never
an atom of evidence to support it. One
reason why cholera was rare among
British troops was that every man was
inoculated against it.

“Coif”: A recent law case in England
has led to a discovery which should be of
considerable interest to the brewing and
distilling trades, and of even more to
the blue-ribbon fraternity. This is a
long-forgotten Act of Edward VI. which
makes it a penal offence to induce anyone
to give up alcoholic drinks. Unless the
Act has been specially repealed in this
country —which is improbable —its pro-
visions apply here. Members of the
Rechabites and other temperance socie-
ties, together with the police magistrates
who often exercise kindly pressure on
drunks to make them sign, the pledge,
will have to look out for themselves,
especially as action may be taken on
the word of a common informer.

“H.W.M.”: Quick thinking? He was

hours when the police arrived. He hur-

coat, and before the intruders reached

“What about a sniff of insect powder?”
him was down on his knees on
the stairs industriously polishing the
brass carpet rods with a large silk hand-
kerchief. The police, taking him for an
employee, brushed him aside and went on
in quest of their legitimate game. Thus
of over a score of men illegally on the
premises he was the only one who wasn’t
prosecuted and fined.

“Cappoquin”: Westralia has a Moss-
man Bay, a little inlet on the Swan
between Perth and Fremantle, named
after some real or fancied
resemblance to the Sydney
Harbor indentation. Doubts
have arisen lately among
local philologists as to
whether the second “s” in
the Swan place-name isn't
unwarranted, and there are
conjectures as to how it can
have crept in, seeing that
there is only one “s” in the
Sydney suburb. Yet it is
more than probable that the
Westralian spelling is cor-
rect, and that it is Sydney
which has been guilty of
orthographical slovenliness.
The name of Archibald
Mossman, who built the
original wharf for whalers
some 90 years ago in the
bay which commemorates
him, is mostly spelt with the
double “s” in histories and
reference books, though
there are a few exceptions—
the “Australian Encyclo-
paedia” is one, And the
name of Hugh Mossman, a
member of the same family,
who was one of the finders
of Charters Towers in the
’seventies, always has the
extra sibilant, and so does
the place in Queensland
named after him. With this backing, the
Westralian Mossmanites needn’t worry.

“Runa”: Our village in the back-
blocks of M.L. boasted a unique local
character. He was a professional pledge-
signer. It was in the days when pro-
hibition was in the air and temperance
orators roamed the country, haranguing
gatherings at every small centre. After
the address the pledge would be pro-
duced and placed on the stage table for
all converts to sign. There was the usual
pause, and it was here that Old Joe always
arose s and led the procession. His shaky
signature must have topped a score of
pledges. As the oldest inhabitant, a rigid
water-consumer, formally presented the
first signer with’a shilling, the procedure
was not unprofitable to Joe, but there was
a dark suspicion that he invariably spent
the prize-money in qualifying for the
leading role in the next pledge-signing
procession.
“Oxmead”: Some of our great dailies
seem desperately afraid of being accused
of disrespect or vulgar familiarity if
they refer to Oriental potentates without
using some conventional prefix. The diffi-
culty began when Japan first secured a
place in the sun (and the cables); it
apparently grated on editors’ suscepti-
bilities to print an item about some states-
man called Yuko Hayashi or Hyo Ugaki
with no more ceremony than one would
write of Bill Jones. Fortunately, Japan-
ese notables are mostly viscounts or
barons, generals or admirals, but when
they weren’t the habit grew of prefixing
their names with the French M. —
giving them brevet rank as Monsieur, so
to speak. Alternative titles are scarcer in
China, but the “S. M. Herald” took the
hurdle manfully the other day.
It is generally believed that the Regent, the
former boy Emperor of China, Mr Henry
Pu-Yi, will be crowned Emperor of Manchuria.
It would be a dreadful lapse of manners,
evidently, to refer to a prospective
Emperor as plain Henry Pu-Yi. But does
poor old Gandhi ever get a “Mister”
before his name?

“Kerys” : An up-country parson rode
some miles to visit a very sick parishioner.
He found the patient obviously sinking,
and on leaving he tried to say a few
comforting words to the wife, ending with
the old assurance that, even if separated
here below, the couple would be re-
united in another sphere. To his sur-
prise the thought seemed to agitate the
elderly woman. She walked to the gate
with him, and as he was about to mount
she unburdened herself: “You see, the
trouble is Jim and me’s never been mar-
ried. We’ve lived together 40 years, and,
except yourself, not a soul knows of it.
But if up there there’s nothing private and
everybody knows all about everybody
else, it’s not going to be too good for us.
Maybe we’d be happier if we didn’t meet
there at all.” The clergyman managed
to reassure her on social conditions up
aloft.

imagination distinguished from the

APPETITES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Lord, creating mankind, great and humble,
In every station, king or luckless wight,
Some doomed to war with Fate and blindly
stumble,
Or, luckier, to climb Parnassian height,
Gave all the liberty to cheer or grumble,
Endowing us, at least, with appetite:
The appetite of golden youth for pleasure,
The boyish urge, insatiate, for food,
And, may we add, of girls for love —in
measure—
Of coarser men for passions hot and crude.
Age is content with rest, respect and leisure ;
Indulgence in things safe and understood.
Some find an appetite for barren splendor,
While others shake the always-loaded dice
Of lust for wealth, and make the swift sur-
render
Of principle to meaner, grasping vice,
While trampling on the gentle and the tender;
Their only test of right, “The price! The
price! ”
But these two bear the palm of exaltation,
Regardless of rebuke or golden shower,
And lend Ambition wings above her station
Wherever human life comes forth in flower:
A woman’s appetite for admiration
And that of striving man for place and
power.

“General Prac.”: I asked the nurses to
prop her up while I examined the lungs
of the old lady with pneumonia. Plant-
ing the business end of my stethoscope

“Spare Corp” (B. 10/1 /’34) objects wear
the kilt and join Scottish regiments? They
have as much right to do it as the Sas-
senach Lowlander —perhaps more. At
least the Irish had a kilt of their own,
and half of the bhoys—witness the
Maguires and the McDonnells —were
originally far better Highlanders than the
laddies frae Leith'and Ayr. Moreover,
from behind the tall timber, might I
suggest that the Hielander himself
pinched the kilt either from the Nor-
wegian, who haunted the Hebrides for
centuries and intermarried with him, or
from the Roman soldier, or both?

of local unemployed are being put to

at “blind” corners, and painting white
lines at various danger spots. In short,
the “model city” is being remodelled

“Old Sarum”: I wonder what is the
smallest number of votes that has put a
man into Parliament in our time. At
the end of last century Westralia had
some outlying constituencies where the
electors numbered the merest handfuls.
I think it was Alex. Forrest, Bigjohn’s
brother, who romped home at the top
of the poll for one of the Kimberleys
with something under 30 votes. And in
Leg. Council elections, where there was
a property qualification, the results were
sometimes quite as startling. I knew a
candidate who formed one of a field of
four which contested one of Westralia’s
nor’-west provinces in the late ’nineties.
He polled only six votes, but even that
minimum of support was sufficient to
save him his deposit; the winner’s tally
was only 27.

“D.E.”: Westralia’s Justice Draper has
granted a divorce to a country school-
teacher on the ground that his wife com-
mitted adultery with one of his pupils.
The youngster is 16, but looks more.
The lady has a son older than the co-re.,
and a daughter to whom he was alleged
to be paying attention. There is nothing
frivolous in her appearance or manner,
but she wrote amazing letters to the
young hopeful, and that artless youth
acknowledged having spent a lot of
time in her bedroom returning her kisses
—he in pyjamas, she in nightdress and
kimono. He insisted that they had not
misconducted themselves. “I do not
believe you,” said his Honor drily. But
in pronouncing the decree nisi and giv-
ing the husband the custody of the chil-
dren, he suggested that the lady was not
normal.

master of the Katoomba'the other day,
per medium of the signal station at
South Head, that he should return to
the wharf and pick up some luggage a
passenger had left behind was described
by most people who heard of it as too
preposterous for words. Still, it all de-
pends on who makes such requests. Not
many years ago there was a dance on
board an Australian steamer the night
she left Sydney; half-way through, one
of the passengers, a world-famous singer,
sent for the master and ordered that the
dance stop immediately. It did.

“Gentle Joe”: Sydney daily news-
papers have taken up the small-town
habit of referring to all civil servants
about to be superannuated as “popular.”
I can’t see how any civil servant of the
upper ranks who does his job con-
scientiously could be popular. I used
to live in a small town, and I re-
member how the populace used to gnash
their teeth when Sergeant Smith (who
was as rough as a wart on a pig’s back
when anyone lodged a complaint) was
given a case of pipes and the local spell-
binder referred to him as “that popular
and energetic officer.” Brown, our post-
master (whose contact with townspeople
in the course of duty was confined to
referring them to the regulations, which
allowed his counter-hands to tyrannise
over anyone they disliked in any way
they liked), was referred to as “popular”
when he retired. Our station-master,
Robinson, was a fair cow. He had no
manners, he didn’t even know the rules
of his own department, and he spent
most of his time inventing excuses for
not allowing the railways to be used.
Yet, when he was retired (“was retired”
is right) the paper said he was “popu-
lar.” Sydney “Sun’s” latest “popular”
“Henry, I DO wish you wouldn’t come to bed with your spurs on!”
official is the governor of a gaol. A fine
fellow, no doubt, but if he was popular
with his clients, why do they build gaols?
* * * *
“Ike Hollar”: A press controversy in
Sydney, under the piquant title of “Sea-
sickness in Song,” has at least exploded
one old delusion; what is generally
known as singing through the nose is
nothing of the sort. It is only when
a singer uses his nasal sinuses fully and
well that he can secure his best effects.
So when even a learned person like ex-
Justice Ferguson talked about crooners
singing through their noses he was alto-
gether in error: the adenoidian objection-
ableness of crooners is produced by their
lazy misuse of passages which were given
to man for the same purpose that its
big pipes are given to an organ. The
hollow bony cavities in the nose —the
maxillary antrum, frontal sinus, mastoid
antrum and the rest —have to be utilised
for their full tonal values in order to
produce the perfect voice.
* * * *
“Exul”: The new Oxford Dictionary
omits a number of words in common use
in Australia, among them “bowyang” and
“larrikin.” Both originated in York-
shire. The “yank” (from Middle English
“hanken”—to tie up)
was a small leather
legging fitting between
knee and boot-top.
If something smaller
were substituted, such
as a piece of twine tied
in a bow, it became a
“bowyank.” The word
is now obsolete in
England. As for “lar-
rikin,” in Yorkshire a
“larrick” is a careless
“good for nowt” ; in
other words, a “lark,”
a wild fellow. When
Yorky is idling or
wagging it he says he
is larkin. It takes but
a roll of the “r” to
make the Australian
word. Try it on a
Pateley Brig native
and he will readily
understand you. Like
“bowyang,” it has
simply been trans-
planted. The word
“mullock” is given in the dictionary as
Australian, derived from the Dutch. It
is good Middle English and was used by
Chaucer. You may still encounter it in
Derbyshire.

“O. de V.”: I am definitely on the
side of “Ibn el Issar” (B. 3/l/’34) and
the anti-turban party. lam not ignor-
ing its advantages; it can be slept in
without apparent damage to its shape ;
its thick folds will effectively break the
impact of a bottle; it can be unloosed
in an instant, to provide a 20ft. length
of material strong enough to enable the
wearer to make a hasty exit from a
window, and so on. But few people
realise just how heavy the turban really
is, and how hot and clammy it makes
the head. For the best all-round head-
dress, I nominate the topee; it is light,
cheap, serviceable, and well ventilated.
“Mahmud”: One virtue possessed by
the turban has been overlooked. It is about
the best and safest repository for valuable
property of small bulk that the writer
has come across. Notes and even coins
are easily concealed and, since the head-
gear is never doffed willingly by the
wearer, are difficult for thieves to get at.
There are exceptions to this safety rule,
however, and the custom of exchanging
turbans with a newly-made friend is one
of them. The classical instance is that
of the transfer of the Koh-i-noor from
Nadir Shah to Ranjit Singh when the
latter had cleaned up Moslem rule in
the Punjab. Ranjit treated his prisoner
well and had him to dinner. When both
had got to the genial stage the Sikh, who
knew well that his guest had the famous
diamond planted in the folds of his
turban, suggested an exchange of head-
gear. Etiquette, and a fair amount of
certainty that he would be strangled if
he didn’t comply, induced Nadir, to
oblige his host. Ranjit’s turn came when
the Raj conquered the Sikh confedera-
tion. The diamond passed from him to
the British Crown through the hands of
John Company.
* * * *
“Vic”: “Ginger Mick” (B. 10/1/’34)
doesn’t go far enough back when he
merely links the swastika with Genghis
Khan and the early Christians. Both
used it—it is a common symbol in the
catacombs; but it appears to have
attained importance in India thousands
of years before the Christian era as a
sun emblem. Schliemann dug examples
of it up in Troy, and it has been found
in Mexico, Peru, among the tribes of
Binghi and —in its most primitive form
as a quartered circle —in New Guinea.
Hitler, however, seems to have settled its
hash for a time.

“Jay Emma”: Our local “character,” a
dame of the rough but honest school,
strolled into the chemist’s shop and
wished him a Merry Christmas. “I s’pose
you’re a bit disappointed,” she added as
an afterthought. “Why?” asked the man
of drugs. “Well, I thought p’r’aps you d
be expecting me to pay that little
account.” Pills replied handsomely :
“We’ll call it paid, Mrs. Rufanonest;
that’ll be my Christmas present.” Mrs.
R.’s thanks were voluble, but presently
she was back again. “What about a re-
ceipt for that Christmas present?” she
asked. “Receipt?” queried the donor.
“Yes,” affirmed the lady, “just so’s you
won’t be giving it to me again next
Christmas! ”
* * * *
“Dr. Mivart”: Melbourne has an insti-
tution (a hospital with a lethal chamber)
which invites “Poor People” to send their
animal pets for treatment. I note that in
1933 the “Hospital for Sick Animals of
Poor People” treated 5977 dogs, 2808
cats, 814 horses, 179 birds and 45 mis-
cellanea, and destroyed 680 dogs and
1085 cats. Most of the destroyed cats
and dogs, I understand, were kidnapped
or shanghaied. Start off any sort of a
hospital on a charitable basis and in time
its administrators, as charity runs drier
and drier, will come to regard every pro-
spective pauper patient as a social enemy.
In another two years the Melbourne in-
stitution for petting sick pets of the poor
will, if it lasts that long, probably be the
most wholesale assassinator of cats and
dogs since the days of the Caliphs.
A RECOLLECTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dawn in Flanders.... Somewhere over Dix-
mude,
A dogfight dinning down the sky;
Spandaus spitting from the black-crossed
Fokkers
And the Vickers making merry in reply.
High on the blood-red altar of the dawning
Were the war god’s offerings hung;
Low in the misty abysses of the morning
Were the flaming victims flung.
Days of battle ’mid the white cloud-castles,
Helmed knights-errant roaring by
To joust with the Stranger and dare all-comers
In the clean blue lists of the sky.
Evenings round the table when the legends
were recounted—
For each man told his tale,
As the wine-cup passed, of strange and lonely
farings
By lofty hill and vale.
Oh, the last great Hangars of Time have closed
On Camel and 5.E.5;
No more we mark in the shaded sun
Where the Pfaltz and the Fokker dive.
Only sometimes at twilight when the sun’s
behind the hill,
In the pale, wan light of the afterglow vainly
we’re watching still,
Strained ,for the beat of an engine that never
will come again,
As we waited long in the days gone by for a
pal in a homing ’plane.

POLITICAL POINTS
If there were an unlimited supply of
Commonwealth trade commissionerships
the unemployment problem would be
solved. The Department of Commerce
advertised three, and there were upwards
of 400 applicants. One is to go to Maori-
land, another to Java and a third to
Shanghai. Australia once had a trade
commissioner in Shanghai who in two
years drew £7838 in salary and spent an-
other £11,309 in various ways. During
the same two years our exports to China
declined by £50,000.
Trial by jury has been re-established
in the Northern Territory in a somewhat
hopeless atmosphere. It was abolished
originally after a local gentleman had
been found not guilty of manslaying on
the ground that he had hit the wrong
man, who was only a Chinaman, any-
way. Reintroduced by Judge Mallam,
it was thrown overboard again last year,
except in murder cases. A mounted con-
stable who is suing the local newspaper
for libel is vehemently protesting against
the application of the new rule to his
case.
Sterilisation of the unfit has entered
the political field in Australia, as was
inevitable. Queensland branch of the
B.M.A. has been asked to furnish a re-
port on the subject to Home Secretary
Hanlon. It is refreshing to see a Labor
Government embarking on an honest
inquiry of this nature, and if it can pre-
vent the intrusion of party it will deserve
well of Queensland —and Australia.
With most of the income-tax revenue
to come in, the N.S.W. deficit is down
£170,000, compared with the correspond-
ing half of 1932-33, but it is still very
high—£2,459,500. Stevens, however, says
he is satisfied, and he is particularly
pleased with the “net improvement” of
£336,600 in Government railway finance.
Still railway receipts are down £222,800,
and the railway deficit last year was
£3,360,400. The “net improvement” is
not sufficient to warrant the 25 per cent,
rise handed to Commissioner Hartigan
while his staff has to carry on with
heavily reduced pay.
Collier is shaping up to the Westralian
Leg. Council. At a special session of
Parliament he reintroduced and piloted
through the Assembly the Financial
Emergency Bill restoring most of the
wage-cuts -made under the Premiers’
Plan —the full 20 p.c. in the case of per-
sons working for private employers.
Then the House adjourned, leaving the
Council to wrestle with the measure this
week.
Many N. S. Wales unions are alarmed
at the capture of the northern miners’
body by the Militant Minority Movement.
The boilermakers are debarring M.M.M.
members from holding official positions
in their union. The boilermakers have
hitherto been regarded as militant, but
actually only certain of their officials
have deserved the description.
George Becker, who was Lands Minis-
ter in the Speck’s last Labor Government,
recently incurred the displeasure of the
State Labor bosses. A somewhat fiery
particle, he objected to the State party
withdrawing from the Federal A.L.P. as
indicating Lang tendencies, and was ex-
pelled. Becker is to nominate as a
Federal Labor candidate at the State
elections; he claims that the “so-called”
Tas. Labor party, having seceded from
the A.L.P., has no expellate jurisdiction,
or words to that effect.
There is no love lost between Pearce
and E. B. Johnston, his fellow-Westra-
lian and -Senator. Returning home for
the recess, Johnston inveighed against
Pearce’s Government for refusing the
wheat bounty to farmers who had taxable
income last year, describing it as “the
meanest and most contemptible action
taken by any Australian Government
since Federation.” The thing is really in-
defensible, but, of course, Pearce must
try to defend it. Whereupon Johnston:
Mr. Pearce is an apple-grower. Assistance
to a settler with a taxable income was not re-
fused in the measure providing for a bounty to
apple-growers.
A palpable hit.
The old trouble between the Fijians
and the swarming Indian is boiling up
again. The Council of the Chiefs has
asked the Government to prohibit any
further immigration of Indians or
Chinese, insisting that Fiji, though ceded
to Queen Victoria by old King Cakabau,
was never intended as a dump for alien
immigration. It protests that Indians
have no right to a say in matters affect-
ing the indigenous poulation. The Coun-
“The Senate has unanimously passed a bill prohibiting financial transactions with foreign
Governments in default to the U.S.A.”
“I’ll teach you guys to default!”
“But you haf been teaching us for ze best part of a century, m’sieur.”
cil is the supreme body controlling native
ownership of the land, and its requests
and decisions have always received care-
ful attention from the Fijian Government
and the Crown.
Uncle Sam is treating this country
shabbily. He refuses to admit more than a
hundred or so Australians p.a. as settlers,
though white Americans are free to come
here in any number; his subsidised
steamers cut into our shipping trade;
his moving-picture industry has drawn
huge revenues from Australia and paid
only a trifle in taxes. The balance of
trade with Australia is always heavily in
his favor; the excess in 1929-30 was
£25,082,000, and in 1928-29 almost as
much. It was thought that our excellent
wine and brandy might get a footing in
the U.S.A. when prohibition was re-
pealed, but imports of Australian wine
to the end of March are to be limited to
10,000 gallons. Ten thousand gallons!
About enough for the requirements of
400 moderate drinkers who take wine
with their meals.
The executive of the N.S.W. Local
Government Association has scolded
Spooner, the Minister, whose offence is
that he dismissed the Bankstown Council
for awarding a long-term contract at a
substantial increase on the current price
and persisting in this attitude when an
investigator reported “irregularities.”
Spooner need not worry, since the rate-
payers are on his side. So are the rate-
payers of Manly, in whose interest
Spooner intervened to prevent £17,000 of
unemployed-relief money being lavished
on municipal dressing sheds. There are
ratepayers’ associations in both places,
and they are standing behind the
Minister.
The U.S.A. Senate is furious with
France and Belgium. It tried to get heavy
taxes clapped on liquor from countries
which have “defaulted in their war-debt
payments.” When the President objected
that this would handicap him in his trade
bargaining, the indignant old gentlemen
passed a bill making it an offence “pun-
ishable with a fine of $lO,OOO, or im-
prisonment for five years, or both” for
any American citizen to lend money to
any defaulting Government or to buy or
sell any securities it may issue “after
the passage of this Act.” The gesture
might look noble if States which elect
many of these Senators had not been in
default for generations to foreign sub-
scribers to their bonds.
Loyal to the marrow, a Sydney club
sent a case of jam to London as a Christ-
mas gift for the King. The case was
refused by the palace housekeeper. Then
someone remembered that such presents
had to pass through the G.-G. before
they would be accepted. The matter was
solemnly referred to the Department of
Commerce, and the necessary formalities
are now in progress: Canberra dispatches
a cable to London ; gets a cable back ;
asks the G.-G. for his official im-
primatur ; cables London again, and
gives the jam a passport. By that time
the club may decide that it ought to
reserve the jam till next Christmas.
Premier McPhee, who announced in
Tas. Assembly a few weeks ago that his
resignation from office, if not from Par-
liamentary life, was imminent, now talks
of hanging on. Lee, who would have
grabbed the McPhee’s plaidie had it
fallen, is the backbone of the Cabinet as
fighter and administrator, but Nats, pre-
fer McPhee. With public servants, busi-
ness- and wages-men (unemployed or
otherwise) sore at the Ministerial inter-
pretation of the Premiers’ Plan, plus the
fact that supporters Campbell, Turner,
Watkins and Soundy have been showing
signs of restiveness, it is felt that any-
thing in the shape of an aggressive
Nationalist policy at the general election
would be risky. McPhee is adept at giv-
ing the soft answer that turneth away
wrath.
John Chinaman used to have his tariff
fixed for him by the foreign importer.
If he protested, the importer would send
along a logical argument in the shape of
a gunboat. When John tore off his pigtail
and became a republican he demanded
the right to fix his own tariff, and as soon
as he got it at the Washington Confer-
ence he started using it like the foreigner,
to protect his growing industries. But he
didn’t stop at that. Whenever he got
into a financial fix he clapped a tariff
on something. Hence the high duty on
imported wheat. The ostensible reason
for the impost is the cost of suppressing
Communists, but John is a large wheat-
grower himself. 3
The long-overdue Commonwealth re-
distribution will make a lot of difference
to electorates in all the States except Tas-
mania, which may not be affected. At
the 1931 polls there were 74,165 electors
in Reid and 35,066 in West Sydney;
70,576 in Barton and 41,682 in Dailey ;
69,721 in Parramatta and 43,489 in East
Sydney. Other N.S.W. divisions showed
disparities almost as glaring ; and Vic-
toria had bad cases: 81,974 electors in
Henty and 39,739 in Melbourne; 69,665
in Kooyong and 43,128 in Yarra. Yet the
law provides for equal electorates save
that there may be a margin of one-fifth
more than the quota, or one-fifth less.
The rush of Langsters for Federal
nominations suggests the existence of a
feeling that the winners of the pre-selec-
tion scrambles will be as good as elected.
Some of these worthies, whoever they
may be, will get a shock when they see
the new boundaries, on which commis-
sioners will shortly be at work. South
Sydney, for example, is almost certain to
lose the Redfern subdivision which made
it a Labor stronghold in the elder Riley’s
time. There are about 10,000 votes in
Redfern, and in 1929 seven of every eight
went to Riley. Redfern adjoins Surry
Hills, which is in West Sydney. At the
last election West Sydney, whose mem-
ber is Beasley, leader of the Lang group,
had 25,162 fewer electors than South
Sydney, which put in a U.A.P. man,
Jennings.
Lyons is careful to warn Australia that
his six months’ surplus of £2,408,000 will
be more than cancelled by increased ex-
penditure during the second half of the
year—this despite the fact that more than
half the amount budgeted for during the
year has been received. Customs have
yielded about 11| millions out of an
estimated 20jr millions. Only income tax
among larger sources has failed to pour
out 50 p.c. of the year’s estimated return,
and it never does in the first half of a
year. The net plus movement in total tax
collections, Commonwealth and State,
since 1923, acording to Prof. Giblin, has
been 35.8 p.c., though production value
fell about 20 p.c. in the period.
After the section of The Bulletin
containing the article “For the Babies”
(page 8) had gone to print, information
was received from the promoters of the
Golden Chest Art Union that total
revenue from the sale of tickets (shillings
and pence omitted) was £32,489. The
cost of running the lottery, including
prizes, was £19,469. A net balance of
£13,042 was available for distribution
among the charities interested.

The last question put to and answered
by Robert Gibson when he was called
to the bar of the Senate on May 6, 1931,
was asked by Senator Harry Kneebone,
of South Aus. Queer that they should
have been united in death, or nearly so.
Kneebone died on December 22 ; Gib-
son on January 1.
A. C. C. Stevens (“Uncle Steve”), a
pioneer among radio announcers, whose
voice is known all over the Common-
wealth, has resigned from the A.B.C. and
in future will be chief announcer on 2UE.
Stevens was born in India ; educated in
England, where he was a school-mate of
Samuel Hordern; was a phenomenal
boy-soprano ; threw up medicine in his
fourth year to serve in the Boer War and
contract enteric fever. He has been law-
giver, roadmaker, tax-collector, soldier,
policeman, stage artist, an army captain
in the Great War, and has been wounded
twice. He was a staff writer on the “Sun-
day Times”; art editor of the “Tele-
graph” ; proprietor and editor of the “Red
Seal Mag.” ; he organised the Cancer Re-
search appeal, which produced £133,000
in seven months. He draws caricatures
and paints in water-color, and is a
vicarious linguist.
A. E. Heath, the newly-appointed
official representative of N. S. Wales in
London, is a quiet-spoken Queenslander
with a firm jaw and a financial brain.
He has been managing director of A. C.
Saxton and Sons, the big Pyrmont timber
merchants, for several years, and in 1932
he made an extended trip to Europe and
America, during which he seems to have
spent most of his time delving into
factories and attending international
Chamber of Commerce meetings. Stevens
has made a good deal of use of him, and
A. E. HEATH, appointed N. S. Wales
official representative in London.
while he was in England he studied the
Australian trade-representation position
and European transport systems closely,
giving the Federal and N. S. Wales
Governments the benefit of his knowledge
on his return. Heath is more a practical
man than a talker, 45, and young for his
age, and the only danger is that the British
authorities, accustomed to the worn-out-
politician type of State representative, will
seize him and put him into South Ken-
sington as a unique specimen when he
arrives in London.
Frank Rouse, who has called it a day in
Toowoomba at 65, was one of a notable
old Australian squatting family. Born
in N.S.W., he was at The King’s School
before going to Queensland, where for
some 30 years he managed Noorindoo
station, near Surat, for his uncle, the late
A. A. Dangar, retiring finally to live in
the Downs capital. A fine amateur rider
and cricketer, he owned some good
horses in his later days, among them
Malt Mark, winner of a Q.T.C. Strad-
broke Handicap and a Carrington at
Randwick.
South Aus. Commissioner of Public
Works H. S. Hudd was a Digger. It’s 22
years since he first entered the Assembly
as member for Torrens. He went away in
T 5 with the 43rd Batt. and brought back
a captaincy and the M.C. Since 1920
H. S. HUDD. South Australian Com-
missioner of Public Works.
he’s been one of the Lib. members for
Alexandra, and he has one of the safest
seats in the House. He’s been party Whip
and secretary, and there were no com-
plaints when Butler gave him charge of
the Works Department.
James Allan celebrated his 77th natal
day attending to the affairs of Allan and
Stark, Brisbane. Born near Airdrie,
Scotland, he started his business career
in Glasgow, 1873. In 1879 Brisbane saw
James arrive to take up a three-year con-
tract with T. Brown and Sons, Ltd. In
1882 he laid the foundations of the
Queen-street business. For several years
he was M.L.A. for S. Brisbane and also
a S. Brisbane alderman. He is a stalwart
of the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary
and Brisbane Clubs, and of the Town-
planning and Brisbane Traders’ Assocs.
From the Office Pursuivant:
In the 20-year-old Lord Petre, who arrives
in Australia in a few weeks, the Common-
wealth will see somebody of such lineage that
if he claimed descent from the Apostle of
the Gate nobody would be surprised. The
young man is the 17th baron. An ancestor
M.P., son of a Principal Secretary of State to
Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth
(no mean feat that in those days of insecure
topknots), got the title in 1603, but there are
older titles in the family. Baroness Furnivall,
for instance, daughter of the 14th baron (and
of the daughter of a Canadian Professor of
Philosophy), holds a barony which is outdone
in age only by a couple of English titles. Hers
dates from 1295. The father of Australia’s
visitor died of wounds received in France in
1915. The family is connected by marriage
with a line of baronets which once defeated
the Hope of Wagga after one of the grimmest
fights in history—the Tichbornes.
There will be widespread sympathy for
Percy Allen, the “S. M. Herald” man
who lost his wife and was seriously in-
jured in the Gundagai motor smash. He
is one of the most faithful servants of the
“Herald,” of which he has been librarian
for some years. His big figure beside that
of the g.m., A. L. Stuart, whose confi-
dant and crony he is, has for years been
a familiar sight in O’Connell-street at
lunch-hour. Allen has spilt ink in most
of the States (he was a reporter at
Boulder in his youth) and across the
Tasman. Some years ago he issued a
handbook of the Pacific Islands which
was a standard work in its line, and he
was partly responsible for the writing of
the “Herald’s” centenary volume. A
modest chap with a lot of good words for
other people’s virtues and none for his
own, there is one way to pick a fight with
him: to say a slighting word about the
“Herald.”
Fred de Jersey, Brisbane’s only, cabby,
came from Guernsey in the ’sixties and,
settling with his parents in Brisbane, took
out his first cabby’s license in 1879. Every
year since then he has renewed it. De
Jersey and his 1914 model hansom-cab
are on view daily in front of the Supreme
Court or the Queensland Club, but the
little short-distance trade he gets in these
days of taxi competition barely pays the
week’s feed bill.
Maoriland’s g.0.m., Dr. Francis Red-
wood, S.M., R.C. Archbishop of Welling-
ton, is to celebrate his episcopal diamond
jubilee next month. He was born in
England 95 years ago and came to M.L.
in ’42, but later went to France to study
for the priesthood. Pius IX. appointed
him Bishop of Wellington in 1874 ; his
see at that time extended from New Ply-
mouth and Wairoa, H. 8., to Waitaki
River, S.L., some 75,000 sq. miles, and
had 31 priests. He’s the oldest R.C. arch-
bishop in the world, and the oldest living
member of the Marist order.
The name of P. J. Hourigan, ancient
of ancients in the N.S.W. legal profession,
has cropped up in the papers to
show how short is history. Barton was
Hourigan’s next-door neighbor at school.
Admitted in 1866 as a solicitor,
Hourigan briefed William Cullen and
Philip Street, later C.Js., in his early
days. So far does he link back with
early history that his commission for
taking affidavits was signed by a man
who was Solicitor-General of Tasmania
in 1825 and the first person knighted for
a service done in Australia—Alfred
Stephen, C.J. of N.S.W. The old gentle-
man, at 88, is still in practice, but has
time to go to Randwick and prove to
a younger generation of bookmakers that
age and experience count in racing as
well as in law.
Consul-General for Greece L. Chrysan-
thopulos is the first member of that
country’s diplomatic service to have had
the Australian post. He had experience
in Thessaly, Egypt, Tripoli, the U.S.A.
and Cardiff before coming to Sydney in
L. CHRYSANTHOPULOS, Consul-
General for Greece.
’26. Except for a short visit home in
1932 —it was rumored at the time he was
to join the Foreign Office in Athens —he’s
been here ever since. A little man, but
a capable one, and pleasant and enter-
taining.
Staniforth Smith, who died in Westra-
lia last week at 64, was Mayor of Kal-
goorlie at 31. He achieved an even
greater triumph, through his likeable per-
sonality and the goldfields vote, when he
topped the poll of the Westralian Sena-
tors at the first Commonwealth elections.
As a politician he hit on the idea of
The late STANIFORTH SMITH, former
Senator and Papuan Administrator.
specialising in the study of the Common-
wealth’s outlying possessions and prob-
lems, with the consequence that, when his
six years’ term was up, a job was waiting
for him as Administrator of Papua. For
two years he was in war service—
he enlisted in the 44th Batt., A.1.F., and
rose to a lieutenancy. Returning in 1919
he had two years as Acting-Adminis-
trator of the then turmoil-stricken
Northern Territory, which had just
ousted Gilruth. Then he returned to
Papua as Lands Commissioner. He did
some good work in Papua, though he
didn’t always hit it with Lieut.-Governor
Murray, and collected a gold medal of
the Royal Geographical Society, among
other distinctions. On retiring a few
years back, he settled on the land in
Sou’-Westralia, where he married a niece
of Premier (now Lieut.-Governor) James
Mitchell, and leaves four small children.
Whether as politician or administrator
“Stan” Smith had a wide circle of
friends ; and he was as conscientious as
he was popular.
“Whitehall” on Crippses:
Sir Stafford Cripps, K.C., the militant Labor-
ite who has been assailing Buckingham Palace,
is an anomaly like his father. Lord Parmoor.
Lord Parmoor is a tiny, boyish-looking octo-
genarian with a mischievous wit and a mind
like a razor. I used to get great pleasure a
few years ago from attending the Privy Coun-
cil when he was sitting at the same time as
Lord Carson. He had a knack of stirring the
tall, glowering Dubliner to fury. Sir Stafford,
who resembles his father in looks and ways,
is everything you don’t expect a revolutionary
to be. He frequents the Athenaeum and the
company of bishops, and is a member of the
Church Assembly. So is Lord Parmoor; in
addition, he has been Vicar-General to the
Diocese of York for over 30 years. Inciden-
tally, Lord Parmoor is a member of the King’s
Club —the Marlborough—and his other three
sons, all of whom are older than Sir Stafford,
are Tories. “Freddie,” the second, is a well-
known London dandy and horseman. He was
wounded and won a D.S.O. and bar in the
war. He married one of the Duke of West-
minster’s divorced wives, and avoids churches
and clericals.

Though the latest figures cover a period
before the sharp rise in the price of wool,
etc., put a bit more heart into traders and
others, they reflect a turn of the tide. A
contraction of £663,462 in interest-bear-
ing deposits was accompanied by a
growth of £237,946 in current accounts,
and of £220,988 in the book value of
advances; bills payable were £303,282
lighter, and liquids were drawn upon for
£880,738. But metals, dairy produce and
wheat, in which the “Scottish” does a
large exchange turnover, lacked strength
in the market, and continue to do so.
There was a further cut in the charge
for advances and in the discount rate for
Treasury bills, while London call money
fetched only a few shillings per cent.,
and old high-rate deposit contracts con-
tinued to run on to maturity, though the
position in this respect is improving.
After providing for contingencies the
slip in gross earnings was £48,513, com-
pared with £219,837 and £311,932 for
the two preceding terms:
1930. 1932. 1933.

Taxation .. . . 227,081 201,812 106,493
Net profit . . 542,736 147,720 219,327
There was a cut of £24,802 in exes, and
£95,319 in the tax bill, mainly the Eng-
lish one. So, after sending £5OOO to the
staff fund, the net result was £71,607
better at 7.1 p.c. on capital (£3,000,000)
as against 4.7, 8.7, 17.7, 19.7, 19.6 and
23.1 p.c. back to 1927, the year in which
the Royal, a Victorian bank, was
absorbed.
The div. was kept at 5 p.c., worth 6 \
p.c. in Australian notes at the current
rate of exchange. To pay a 5 p.c. div.
plus interest on perpetual stock —there
is £1,872,966 of it, a reminder of the
’nineties, costing the co. a shade over
3i p.c. —capital, reserves and perpetual
stock combined need net only 2| p.c.
The market prices the £5 shares paid
to £3 at £5 15s. as against £4 14s. a year
ago. With exchange as it is, the return
at £5 15s. is 3.2 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div.
basis ; so the investor who looks for a
shade over 4 p.c. on his money counts
on a 6 p.c. distribution (= 8 p.c. Aus-
tralian currency), which is already within
reach.
Balance-sheet figures continue to dis-
close a solid structure:

When the books closed liquids were
43.6 p.c. of the liabilities to the public
as against 40.4 p.c. two years earlier :
advances, etc., were 86.3 p.c. of the
deposits compared with 84.3 p.c. at the
previous balance, and the bank was hold-
ing only £3 12s. lid. of the public’s
money for every pound of its own, in-
cluding perpetual stocks. It all means
low earning power until trade and indus-
try call for more of the funds.

*Subject to specific reserves.
This co. took over ihe Australian section
of the Nestle and Anglo-Swiss Co.’s
world-wide business in 1921 for
£2,650,000, of which £2,500,000 was in
fully-paid ords. To finance erection of
a chocolate factory at Abbotsford, Syd-
ney, and other extensions to the business
the public put up a further million in
8 p.c. cum. prefs., the div. being guaran-
teed by the parent. Though visibly there
was never much more than 3| p.c. avail-
able for the ords., liberal allowances had
been made for contingencies, and the
money accumulated faster than it could
be used in the business. Slump further
reduced the co.’s capital requirements,
and since £1,889,154 was held in cash and
readily-realisable securities at the end of
June, 1931, £1,500,000 of the ord. capital
was returned. The parent immediately
guaranteed the pref. capital as well as the
div. thereon, thus lifting the net tangible
cover to over £lO per share. Also, the
Australian co. waived its rights under the
N. S. Wales Interest Reduction Act, which
means that 8 p.c. instead of 6.2 p.c. is
actually paid. The 8 p.c. was covered
nearly \\ times by last year’s net earnings
in Australia.
All this and the improved outlook and
the cheapening of money have sent the
market price of the prefs. from 245. 9d.
to 345. 3d. over the last two years. The
return at 345. 9d. is 4.6 p.c.
Last year the co. handled a larger ex-
port business ; much of it was passed on
from the parent in order to reap some
of the benefits of the Ottawa agreement.
But owing to the dulness locally, and
loss of interest on capital returned, there
was a slip of £7024 in declared net
profit:

The allowance for taxation was £lO,OOO
lighter, so there was an improvement of
£2976 in the amount available for dis-
tribution.
The co. is still strongly ribbed, notwith-
standing the return of capital:

value of fixed assets and £48,035 to
debtors, cash, etc., stocks were reduced
by £45,227. The more or less liquid
surplus (£1,104,239) was £17,258 stronger
than at the previous balance.

Considering the experience of residen-
tial hotels generally, Usher’s has done
particularly well. Last year’s profit was
the best for the past decade. Gross earn-
ings, which fell from £46,295 in ’29 to
£33,304 in ’3l, were £40,372 in ’33, when
the improvement was £1724. Over the
four years the ratio of net to gross earn-
ings rose from 19.5 p.c. to 37.2 p.c.; it in-
dicates a very tight hold upon exes.
(£25,329, down £1309 last year). After
handing the prefs. their full contract rate
enough was left to show 9.2 p.c. on the
£156,000 of ord. capital as against 7.3, 5,
6.1, 5.5, 8.4, 7.3 and 6.2 p.c. back to
1926. So 2 \ points were added to the
div., making it 9 p.c. Over the last
decade 95.8 p.c. of the net earnings has
been distributed in divs. averaging 6.4
p.c., leaving £10,304 of the capital un-
represented by tangibles when the books
last closed. That is leaving the deprecia-
tion reserve (£21,600), to which £l2OO
was added during the year, out of the
reckoning. Goodwill figures at £17,132.
The financial position improved:

Last year £2004 was chipped off. the
overdraft, reducing the excess of liabili-
ties over more or less liquids to £12,874,
a net gain of £3048 over the twelvemonth.
There has been little change in the book
value of fixed assets since 1928, notwith-
standing alterations and improvements
meanwhile. In this class of business much
depends upon expenditure on replace-
ments, etc.
After the site of the old Metropolitan
Hotel was sold to the now defunct Daily
Telegraph Co. in 1913, A. J. Usher built
a new Metropolitan a few doors down
the street. Then came the years when
everybody bought his neighbor a drink,
and Usher’s was able to double its capital
by the issue of £78,000 of bonus scrip
in 1920, assets being written up £54,414
for the purpose. Until recently. it has
been a struggle to pay moderate divs.
Maintenance of the present rate depends
chiefly upon whether the business con-
tinues to hold, and that in turn largely
depends upon management. Competition
can be expected to sharpen.
On the market the pound shares, priced
at Bs. 6d. early in ’3l, now fetch 31s.
3d. The return at 31s. 3d. is 5.8 p.c. on
a 9 p.c. div. basis. The prefs. (7000 of
them) seldom come on to the market.
Excluding the depreciation reserve, the
net tangible backing is £2l 16s. 3d. prefs.,
and 18s. Bd. ords.; all in fixed assets.

During the fat years about two-thirds
of the net earnings came from the Lon-
don end of the business. But that was
sold in 1928 at a profit of £362,587, leav-
ing the co. with its Australian interests
and an abundance of surplus funds. The
intention was to reinvest the money in
the trade, but the outlook changed, and
the board returned half the capital
instead, reducing it to £146,098 in 12,500
8 p.c. cum. prefs. and 133,598 ords. The
ords., whose holding was doubled by the
bonus issue of 1928, thus had their
original capital returned in full, and still
retain an interest in the business equal to
their former holding. The rest of the
sale money was put out in loans, mort-
gages, etc., and £lO,OOO was invested in a
new subsidiary for the manufacture of
waxed-paper containers.
During the last term the co. added
a new line (50-50) to its list of
soft drinks, trial shipments of concen-
trated fruit juices to southern Asia resulted
in repeat orders, and the business of the
National Cone Co. was bought (price not
mentioned) and its plant transferred to the
Prahran factory, to which another storey
is to be added in order to cope with
the larger tradingr Gross earnings from
the trade (£35,546) improved £5701. Exes.
(£41,866) took £2028 of the increase, leav-
ing the loss at £6321 as against losses of
£9993, £17,803 and £4119 for the three
preceding terms. The return from out-
side investments was £2254 lighter at
£13,129 (equal to 9 p.c. on ord. capital,
after allowing for the pref. div.). The
year’s net return from all sources was
£1217 better at £6807, which was £873
short of the year’s pref. requirements and
5 p.c. to the ords.

Last year the Australian business
improved, but the Maoriland section
was unprofitable again. The net
result from all sources was £5252 better
at £7787, which was £2220 more
than a full year’s pref. requirements. But
the debt called for reduction; so the
board has made an unusual proposal to
hand the prefs. 10 p.c. in fully-paid B
shares at face value, though the co. can
ill afford to pay a div. with a sting in
its tail.
The market notes the effect of the debt
upon earnings—they depend largely
upon Government expenditure—and that
competition is keen ; it therefore prices
both lots of prefs. at 13s. or thereabouts.
The cash value of last year’s div. is thus
around 6{ p.c.
During the year the co. sold its steel-
pipe plant at Singapore, formerly
operated on joint account, to Hume Pipe
(Far East), Ltd., at book value (£14,985
at Sept. 30, 1932). For rights in the
F.M.S., Straits Settlements and China, the
vendor is to get half of any profit that
remains after allowing 8 p.c. cumulative
on capital invested by the purchaser in
the steel pipe business. The sale money,
together with the year’s surplus earnings,
was used mainly to reduce the debt by
£27,435:

Investment interest centres largely in
the successful operation of the co.’s
foreign patents. These it sold to the Steel
Pipe and Lining Co. in 1928 for £500,000
in fully-paid ords., and bought 20,000
8 p.c. cum. prefs. for cash. All this scrip
it took into its own books at £154,528,
reducing the patents item (now £100,900,
not treated as an asset herein) by
£152,824 net. Subsidiaries have since
purchased the rights for S. Africa, India
and part of the U.S.A.; it is impossible
to say when they are likely to contribute
to the pool. Negotiations for the sale
of rights for Japan continue to drag.
Cinema Co. Finance
There was nothing cheery for inves-
tors in last week’s evidence at the inquiry
into the film industry in N. S. Wales.
Reference was made to the capital, not
to the overdrafts, of Hoyts and Greater
Union. Hoyts (paid capital £2,285,000)
amalgamated Hoyts Theatres, Ltd., and
J. C. Williamson’s picture interests in
1926, and the Fox Film Corp. of America
became interested later ; Greater Union
(paid capital £400,000) took over the
assets of Union Theatres (paid capital
£2,611,198) from the receiver a couple
of years ago. According to S. F. Doyle,
head of the Union group, it was the
bank which insisted upon Hoyts and
Union getting together. Thus General
Theatres Corp. was formed ; it controls
the interests of the two groups in the
capital cities of the States, and has an
issued capital of £40,000, one half owned
by Hoyts and the other half by Greater
Union.
For the ll{ months to Dec. 15 the
gross earnings of this General co. were
£1,188,475, of which £305,492 was paid
to distributors, and working exes, ran
off with £852,187, leaving £30,796, out
of which rents, rates, taxes, insurance,
etc., had to be paid.
Greater Union started with a paid capi-
tal of £lB,OOO ; it issued another £70,000
of scrip in satisfaction of debts taken
over, and put out a further 312,000 bonus
shares to make capital equal to the esti-
mated book value of the undertaking.
The lot is held in this way:
Original Debt Bonus
Capital. Payments. Shares. Total.
Amalgamted £2,628 £10,220 £45,552 £58,400

Spencers . . 4,806 18,690 83,304 106,800
£lB,OOO £70,000 £312,000 £400,000
Greater Union is to hand not less than
20 p.c. of its annual net earnings to the
liquidator of the old business until its
creditors are paid in full. The estimated
profit for 1933 is £5OO. To pay a 5 p.c.
div. the co. needs to net p.c. or more.
Samuel Allen and Sons
This co. (headquarters are at Towns-
ville, Q.), has been in the wine, spirit
and general merchandising trade since
1890. Of recent years it developed a
large indenting and agency business in
the capitals of the Eastern States. To
help finance this £200,000 of 8 p.c. pref.
capital (half firsts and the other half
seconds) was got in about 10 years ago ;
it is preferential as to dividend only.
Slump, exchange and the tariff made
business unprofitable, so the Brisbane,
Sydney and Melbourne branches were
closed, and more attention was given to
cash trading. Profit for the year to June
30 last was £10,206, as against a loss of
£165,978 (mainly bad debts) for the pre-
ceding 12 months, and there was £48,000
in accrued divs. coming to the prefs. To
clear the slate of intangibles, £150,000
was recently lopped off capital—five new
shares were handed out for every seven
old ones, prefs. and ords. alike—reducing
the figure to £375,000 in 71,428 first and
a like number of second prefs. and
232,144 ords.
The board now asks the prefs. to
accept £24,000 (= 4 p.c. p.a.) in full
settlement of dividend arrears to June
30 last—payment to be made in four
equal annual instalments —and to reduce
their rate of dividend from 8 p.c. to 5
p.c. cumulative (a cut of 37£ p.c.) as
from that date. In return they are offered
the right to participate equally with the
ords. in future profits “available for
dividends in any year, after the ords.
h*ave had 5 p.c.” For the seven
years to the close of accounts in 1919 the
ords. averaged 8.4 p.c. Much of the ord.
capital, however, had been provided out
of surplus earnings, which makes 5 p.c.
or over worth more to the ords. than to
the prefs. No harm would be done if
the prefs. were given an equity in surplus
earnings equal to the arrears of div.
(£24,000) which they are now asked to
forego.
Bulolo Gold Dredging has made a dis-
covery that has been the lucky lot of
more than one old pick and shovel pros-
pector ; it has been working on a false
bottom. Last December four deep test
bores were sunk through the first bottom.
The result was the discovery of fresh wash
estimated to be 53ft. deep throughout the
upper half of the original Bulolo area.
The stuff is figured to be worth a trifle
over 20 gold cents to the c.y.

The reopening of the Mt. Biggenden
gold-bismuth deposits is likely to be one
of the interesting mining operations in
Queensland during 1934. The lode car-
ries gold, bismuth, magnetite and cobalt
in small quantities. The values lie in the
gold-bismuth concentrates; but the show
could be worked as an iron mine if neces-
sary. Large bodies up to 50ft. wide,
carrying magnetite, occur between the
contact of granite and limestone. Most
of this carries a little bismuth; the high-
grade ore comes from pockets associated
with the major bodies. Before flotation
became established, the ore was too com-
plex for satisfactory treatment. Yet from
1890 to 1901 over 300 tons of bismuth
concentrates were produced. These con-
tained 57520 z. of gold, making their
total value roundly £150,000. Selective
mining and prospects of successful
flotation now make the proposition look
more than ordinarily attractive.
Gold-mining prospects in the Clon-
curry (Q.) district show no signs of im-
provement. At May Downs the 100 ft.
crosscut on the Crescent disclosed much
lower values than those obtained at the
45ft. level. Driving continues at the
lower level in the hope of picking up
the shoot. A small Government battery
at the Gilded Rose is helping a number
of prospectors on ore that is too low-
grade for shipment to Chillagoe Smelters.
The Freda and Comstock, which
appeared to have good chances, were
secured under option by a Brisbane
group ; but the option has been branded
back.

“Buckland”: When several cos., in-
cluding some with extensive Malayan
experience, and the Oroville Dredging
Co., of London, recently applied for
leases of the old gold dredging areas
on the upper Ovens River (Vic.), opposi-
tion at once came from the farm-
ing community on the lower reaches of
the stream. They voiced the old objec-
tions—pollution, land erosion, floods and
the conversion of agricultural land into
boulder heaps. The applications, which
have been held up, are now under con-
sideration by a sub-committee of the Vic-
torian Cabinet. The applicants under-
take to instal modern dredge equipment,
which resoils areas as fast as they are
worked, and by the use of settling dams
no silt will be permitted to reach the
river. Oroville proposes to drive its
dredge with electricity from Yallourn, or
by an oil-driven plant on the spot; so the
old trouble of deforestation for steam-
boilers would also be avoided. Many
areas dredged under old conditions in
Malaya have since been redredged by
modern plants, and they are now valu-
able agricultural land. It is claimed that
similar results will follow on the upper
Ovens, where early Chinese sluicing
and dredging operations converted miles
of river frontage into unsightly and use-
less rubbish heaps.

Wiluna (W.A.) moves forward. An
establishment expenditure of well over a
million sterling now enables it to treat
more than 40,000 tons a month, for a
profit in Australian currency of nearly
£50,000, and the throughput is expected
to increase before long. Meanwhile pros-
pecting of the northern leases, over a
mile away from the main workings, has
begun, and encouraging results have been
obtained. What amounts to a second
mine seems likely to be opened up. The
co. last month declared an interim
maiden div. of 2s. (sterling) per share.
Further distributions are expected to
increase, provided there is no serious fall
in currency price of gold. At the present
rate of extraction there is enough ore
measured up (1,532,000 tons at Aug 31,
1933) to supply the mill for the next
three years. With gold at its present
price, this ore is worth over 555. in Aus-
tralian currency ; working costs, includ-
ing 2s. 6d. for development, etc., are
now below 19s. a ton.

The miners at Kalgoorlie (W.A.) have
decided to refer their new schedule of
wages and conditions to the Arbitration
Court. Chief points of this schedule are
an increase in the minimum wage to £1
per shift and a reduction of working
hours. The advance in wages asked for
would add over £265,000 p.a. to the bill
of the Golden Mile cos. Divs. paid by
Lake View, Gt. Boulder and South Kal-
gurli for their last financial periods total
£373,750.
* * * *
“Bit”: In spite of the tremendous
American oil output and the opening up
of new fields, a lot of money is now being
spent in U.S.A. in tapping the lower
levels of old fields gone dry. Some of
these have proved to be more prolific
than in their early days. On one, Kettle-
man Hills, California,' the hole is now
down 11,000 feet —the deepest bore in
the world. It took a year to put down
with a hydraulic rotary drill, working at
100 r.p.m. The cost has already exceeded
£50,000, and it is intended to go another
500 ft. One of tl\e problems is the great
heat (240 degrees Fahr.) developed at
the bottom of the bore. Ordinary clay
lubricant for the bit was found to be use-
less, and a special one had to be com-
pounded. These experiments are interest-
ing in view of the fresh attempt to be
made at Roma (Q.), where Oil Search
has taken up some 640 acres, and a subsi-
diary, Drillers, Ltd., has been formed to
sink holes to greater depths than hitherto
attempted in Australia.

For the 10 months to the end of 1933,
King Solomon Deep Lead (M.L.) paid
divs. equal to 75 p.c. of its capital
(£13,000), and another 25 p.c. is tipped
to be distributed within the next couple
of months. The shilling shares fetch
around 3s. 4d. in the market. The mine
was discovered as early as 1914 by G. E.
D. Seale. It was first worked about 12
years ago, but the cash petered out, and
the show was taken over by the present
co. after the paper price of gold lost its
statutory anchor. Ground adjacent to
King Solomon is now being bored by
Dunedin interests.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Has gold been found in connection with
lignite ? (2) Which track did Rev. W. B. Clarke
take when he found gold in the Maffra-Cooma
district? —9611.
(1) Payable alluvial gold was found at
Kiandra under deposits of lignite and clay. The
lignite was formed at a later date than the auri-
ferous drift, and has no bearing on the occur-
rence of the latter. (2) Rev. W. B. Clarke re-
fers to an occurrence of gold in amygdaloid
on p.p. 137-143 of his “Southern Goldfields.”
He makes no mention of which track he took
at the time, but describes the locality of the
occurrence as being “on the side of a hill
south of the creek (Bobundara Creek) and near
the track leading from Cooma to Maffra.”
To what extent is Kandos interested in Goliath
Portland Cement ? —9839.
Nominees of the Kandos Co. hold a number
of shares in Tasmanian Cement Pty., and will
in due course receive Goliath scrip for their
holding. Beyond this Kandos has no interest
or say in the affairs of the Goliath Co.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
D.J.W.: (1) Cannot say; the volume of oil
present would be the governing factor. (2)
Owing to structural faults, production in Maori-
land has been intermittent. (3) Write Mines
Department, Wellington, N.Z C. Brisbane:
Write manager, Boulder Perseverance, Box 94,
Fimiston, Westralia F. S. Mayfield: (1) No,
.... (2) Under certain conditions a policy taken
out by a wife on her husband’s life would not
form part of the husband’s estate. In these
circumstances the policy would be the sole
property of the wife, who would collect the
proceeds in the event of a claim arising....
Oxo: (1) and (2) List of shareholders can be
inspected at Registrar-General’s office, Perth,
W.A., on payment of small fee. (3) Last
declared ore reserves total 350,000 tons, aver-
aging 9.Bdwt. Recent development work has
disclosed a lot more payable stone. Monthly
rate of extraction last year was about 2100
tons... .R.H.: (1) No record of process, but
understand Westralian ore more difficult to
treat than either Canadian or German. (2)
Market limited; no prices quoted in Australia.
(3) Try Frank Hambridge, 22 Bridge-street,
Sydney E. 8.: If safety of capital is im-
portant. certainly not. F. T. Wimble’s prefs.

Regent, is one of those characters often
met with in Hollywood dramas, Vic-
torian fiction and comic strips who are
unconscious propagandists for naughti-
ness. Richard Cromwell, as the young
son of Preston Foster, freak-show pro-
prietor, is a grown-up edition of the vel-
vet-suited small boy with curls who
suffers well-merited indignities in films
about juveniles. Minna Gombell and
Clara Bow, who are dancers, begin by
making him drunk, and Mr. Foster’s
anguish is terrible to witness. Then
Clara Bow decides to ruin the boy. At
this stage she is a dissolute harridan who
looks old enough to be his mother. With
the dawn of love she begins to shed both
her years and her wicked ways, and by
the time they get married she looks
relatively young.
The freak-show proprietor has made
reflections on her character, and the son
has hissed the word “Liar!” in his father’s
face (receiving the customary knock-out
in return), so the young people have to
rely on her abilities as a breadwinner. She
supports the lad in luxury by dancing
with less on than ever, and then the in-
tolerably maudlin
father reappears and
all is well.
A ghastly show on
the emotional side;
but the direction is
slick, the shots of
the freaks and the
trains on which they
travel are interest-
ing, and there is
some first-class low-
comedy acting by
Herbert Mundin.
“The Big Brain” is
the latest film about
a swindler of the
Stav i s k y breed.
George Stone —pre-
viously known to
movie fame as an
interpreter of minor
gangster part s —is
well cast as Max
Werner, an illiterate
little Jew barber
who makes millions
when he launches
out as a company-
promoter. On a liner
bound for Europe he
strikes an English
peer. The writer felt
dubious about Lord
Darlington’s plus-
fours in such an en-
vironment till he re-
called an English
marquis who wore a
bowler hat on a P.
and O. ship between
Tilbury and Mar-
seilles. Apparently
some of these British
noblemen obey no
sartorial laws but
their own.
In Lon d o n —a
strange Yankeefied
London where the
newspapers are
allowed to speculate
about the prosecu-
tions that will arise
from a pending libel
suit —the Jew and the peer work a Rou-
manian oil ramp. Lord Latham, a news-
paper magnate, casts vehement doubts
on the venture, and finally gets them
gaoled.
It’s only melodrama, of course, but the
acting is remarkably good ; and there are
some revealing glimpses into the mind
of a wild-cat financier. The child-like
vanity ; the credulity of the man who
lives on the credulity of others ; the hyp-
notic power which the gambler-crook
often possesses of soothing the suspicions
of gambler-investors —these and other
Kruegerish traits are cleverly emphasised.
* * *
“Wild Boys of the Road,” at Sydney
Capitol, digs into sociology and reads a
moral lesson out of the doings of the
wild youngsters who were let loose on
America by the depression.
Frankie Darro and Dorothy Coonan are
characters such as the editors of children’s
magazines love, and the story, which is
constructed with humor and intelligence,
ends happily with a benevolent magistrate
prophesying better times for both parents
and children. If it is N.R.A. propaganda,
as seems probable, it is very slickly done,
and some of the speeches put into the
mouths of 15-year-old boys and girls
crystallise modern discontents with con-
siderable artistry. A feature of the ser-
mon, if it is a sermon, is its restraint.
It doesn’t touch tragedy on one side or
farce on the other, and the incidents por-
trayed arise naturally out of the circum-
stances propounded. A refreshing change
from melodrama.
“The Chief” is a waste of 5877 feet of
film and 77 minutes of time. It features
Ed Wynn, who wears a Chaplin bowler,
Harold Lloyd spectacles and William
Jennings Bryan hair. He lacks the gravity
that made Chaplin and Bryan so funny,
and, unlike Lloyd, he has no lucid inter-
vals whatever. He portrays an imbecile
who continually falls over his own feet
and emits wise-cracks that were old when
Washington was a boy. A snuffling
giggle is his sole bid for originality.

“Lady for a Day,” which was pre-
shown at the St. James on Sunday night,
is Hollywood satire on Hollywood at its
best.

woman who manages inexplicably to

ful dottiness all these notabilities,
attended by a flight of policeman on

May Robson, as Apple Annie, Warren

shots. With the help of some genuinely
witty dialogue they make this one of
those rare shows that cause intelligent
folk to feel like taking back all the hard
things they ever said about American
films.

“A Ticket in Tatt.’s” at Hoyts, Mel-
bourne, is the latest vehicle for the talents
of George Wallace. The producers have
tried to make the pie-faced comedian the
focal centre of the picture, and as long
as he monopolises the canvas it is undeni-
ably funny. But there is also a story
about how Thelma Scott wagers with
Frank Harvey that if Hotspur wins the
Cup she will marry him and if it doesn’t
she won’t, or the other way about This
part of the yarn is so sketchily dealt with
that it becomes boresome. .

e , e of (he music rammed
into the ears of Australian audiences by
American film-makers is “Rubinoff and
his Orchestra.” Rubinoff as a fiddler isn’t
impressive. His orchestra consists of
mediocre pianists, fiddlers and drummers.
It specialises in the kind of stuff that
lends itself to the art of the crooner.
When he plays a few staves solo, he is
projected upwards on a sort of hydraulic
plunger. He leers languishingly, and the
band smirks in sympathy. Moving pic-
tures thrown on the background—they
are mostly scenes on crowded beaches or
in railway stations —suggest that the
music represents the holiday spirit.
The conductor sinks down on his
hydraulic plunger and a female singer
takes his place. She sits on one grand
piano, puts her feet on another and
yawps the snatches of inane recitative on
a falling cadence which are supposed to
indicate sentiment. Why are Australians
expected to enjoy this sort of thing?
Broadcasting station 2FC in Sydney,
which should know more about Austra-
lian musical taste than Hollywood, was
sending over the ether on the same day
that the Vitaphone film was released on
that metropolis songs by Beethoven and
Max Reger, sung by Madame Orff-
Solscher. The Yankees can make good
music. They buy some of the finest prac-
titioners of the art, and their leading
orchestral and operatic organisations have
first-class ranking. Why don’t they send
some of it here with their films?
Shadow Shows.
It has been fashionable in musical
circles for 30 years to sneer at Verdi’s
“Trovatore,” but the opera remains the
most popular ever written. It contains
more well-remembered melodies than any
other, and it simply refuses to be done
to death. The A.B.C. broadcast per-
formance had an adequate orchestral
backing; Lionello Cecil’s tenor was at
its best in “II Balen” ; Evelyn Hall sang
with feeling the vigorous music accorded
to Azucena, and the languishing Leonora
was represented by that very sweet
singer Madame Goossens-Viceroy. Signor
Aldrovandi’s baton kept band, chorus and
soloists in step.

The license to sell spirited kickers is in
no immediate danger of being withdrawn
from “Collits’ Inn,” at Melb. Princess,
where the pressure at the box-office daily
demonstrates the drawing-power of Aus-
tralian history when it is served up on
the platter of romance by such people as
Gladys Moncrieff, Claude Flemming and
George Wallace. “Gay Divorce,” whose
humor is of the unorthodox persuasion,
continues to flourish at the King’s, and
the management has seen fit to provide
special matinees for the holiday-makers
who need a place of refuge from the
Melbourne summer. This week’s Tivoli
provender is “Military Pickles,” Fred
Miller still being the leading laughsmith.
The last vestiges of the Christmas season
are gradually fading from the scene, and
“Mickey Mouse” made his departure
from the Bijou on Saturday, though
“Cinderella” still lingers at the Palace.
Barrie’s “Dear Brutus” comes off the
Garrick boards on Friday. On Satur-
day Gregan McMahon will furnish
“Musical Chairs,” by Ronald Mackenzie
—an Australian premiere.
“T-Square”: Let me say a word for
modern architectural tendencies and for
“modernist” pictures, two things which
have been heavily assailed. The keynote
of both is simplicity and economy. In
architecture economy is a matter of giv-
ing a maximum of floor space for a mini-
mum of money —hence a passion for low
ceilings. To make the interior —girders
and concrete in rectangular patterns
smoothed over with plaster —self-pos-
sessed, one may be bold and finish it in
whitewash, or timorous (at the cost of
Is. 6d. per room) and allow a pastel shade
in the walls and ceiling. In any case the
floors, if they aren’t covered with carpet,
simply must be dark, which means you
can use wood of any sort that will sur-
face up smoothly under the sanding
machine. The exterior may have either
the beautiful simplicity of a packing-case,
the contours of a steam radiator or (in
the case of especially sybaritic builders
of department stores or movie theatres) a
tiled imitation of one of the classic styles
translated, as in a concave mirror, into a
perpendicular distortion. If you live in
one of these abodes you will find (if your
furniture has dignity) that there is a jar-
ring note. The best joiners build from
models approved by connoisseurs from
the days of the poor mutt who planned
the Doric column and entablature down
to crabbed old Ruskin. There are only
two ways to cock a snook at the furni-
ture and its creators. Scrap it and sub-
stitute tubular or cubic stuff, or stick on
your walls paintings so crude that both
your furniture and your interior archi-
tecture, faced by a calamity beyond their
worst imagination, fall into each other's
arms and swear eternal friendship.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Walkabout”: It was fly time, and
Jacky, with two swollen eyes as a result
of bites from the pests, asked the boss
for ’bacca. The boss obliged. “Here’s a
couple of fly-papers, too, Jacky,” he re-
marked affably ; “you puttem longa camp,
catch plenty flies.” Picking up the
tobacco, Jack left the fly-papers, with the
remark: “Flies no good supposum me do

“Jindivick”: A contractor in a Murray
township possessed a draught horse that
jibbed. A day came when the combined
efforts of all hands failed to make that

"Yes, an’ I bet the brute’ll stick there till six o’clock.”
horse do what he was wanted to do, and
the boss said he’d have the brute shot,
One of the men said he thought he could
work a cure; so a dray was dragged
into position, tailboard to the river,
three or four yards from the bank. The
horse, his harness hung on him un-
buckled, was placed between the shafts
and the breeching fastened. The man
with a recipe for curing jibbers grabbed
the bridle-rein and bellowed “Git up, you
dear, gentle little creature.” True to
form, the draught put his rump
against the cart and backed vigorously,
and in three seconds he followed the
cart over the bank and both smacked
wallop into the river. The horse, who
had done a lot of swimming, and even
some thinking, landed at a boat-stage a
mile downstream; the dray
was hauled out higher up
The horse is still alive and
still in harness; but the con-
tractor says he’s still a cow.
He doesn’t jib, but he simply
won’t back.

“Gilbulla”: A cattle-dog
killed half a dozen of his
master’s fowls. When the
crime was discovered Bluey’s
owner gathered the victims
together, led the culprit to
where their corpses lay, and
gave him a hiding. Next day
another batch of slain chooks
was discovered—but the dog
had collected them in a heap.
He deduced that he had been
punished for untidiness.
* * *
“Gone Bush”: The last act
in one of Sydney’s most
ghastly tragedies was played
out last week, when two dogs
which had been annoying the
inhabitants of the Liverpool
district were shot from am-
bush. They had belonged to
the murderer Moxley, and
accompanied him while tim-
ber-getting in the scrub coun-
try between Liverpool and
Holdsworthy. When he left
the district after the murders
the dogs hung about his old
camp, living mostly on the
scraps left behind by the
human ghouls who flocked in
hundreds to picnic by the ex-
cavations where the murderer had buried
his victims. As interest faded, these sup-
plies ceased, and the dogs, now fairly
back to the wild, took to robbing poultry
yards and pulling down young calves.
For months attempts to catch them were
futile, until one was wounded. Hearing
his cries, his mate came galloping to his
aid and shared his fate —rather a shabby
end, after all, for a tyke who couldn't
leave a cobber in distress.
* * * *
“Coper”: That’s a lovely story about
the motherless foal that refused the
bottle (B. 3/1 /’34), but survived to
become “a jolly good sprinter” by learn-
ing to suck a cow after watching the
calves at work; but it isn t credible In
a long experience of the bookmaker s
best friend, writer has come in contact
with plenty of “poddy” horses but can-
not recall one that was notable, ro
one thing, mare’s milk contains a tre-
mendous percentage of that essential
muscle- and stamma-builder sugar. No
milk contains more, save, peihaps, t a
of the donkey. No cow in the world
could supply this essential ration in the
food of the young horse or donk, a
ration which accounts for the pluck and
endurance of both breeds and of their
byblow the mule.

“Emmet”: Some recent references in
The Bulletin to the intellectual capacity
of ants prompt the observation that it
is as well this hymenopterous creature
stopped short in its evolution when it
did—some millions of years ago. Had
the ants continued to develop until, say,
“By cri’, if you don’t stop naggin’ this pfeller he’ll go to sleep and let you talk
to yourself.”
they had become as big as bull-terriers,
it is most likely that none of the verte-
brate animals, and that includes Homo
sapiens, could have existed. What is
true of the ant is true of all the insects.
Their breathing apparatus consists of tiny
tubes radiating all over the body. As long
as the insect is a small one, that system
functions perfectly. With an increase to
the size of a mouse the tiny air tubes
could not feed such a large body and
suffocation would follow—in fact, that
happened geologic ages ago, fortunately
for mankind. The ant’s tiny brain-space
limits him to rigid channels of behavior,
a handicap he shares with most poli-
ticians. Give him a bigger allowance of
grey matter and he might add imagina-
tion to instinctive skill, in which case he
would learn too much for the comfort
of the lords of creation.
* * * *
“Rana”: Some of the Sydney papers
went out of their way the other day to
register surprise because a frog at Graf-
ton (N.S.W.) had given warning of the
presence of a snake in a dwelling house.
In western Queensland of the long ago
the presence of the big, fat, green frogs
which were so fond of roosting in the
wall-plates of the buildings used to be
encouraged for this reason. Snakes were
always coming into the houses in those
days, and if one slithered within coo-ee
of a frog everyone for a hundred yards
round knew of it. The frog didn’t croak,
but uttered a shrill, alarming cry I can
only describe by the old Scottish word
“chittering.” There was no doubt about
the note of alarm in it, and when it was
sounded everyone within hearing reached
for a stick.
* * * *
“Peu”: In a recent number of the
“Australian Naturalist” A. S. Le Souef
says that lots of fishes seem to thrive as
well in fresh as in salt water, enjoying
both indiscriminately, thus upsetting an
almost universal belief. Writer saw an
instance of the double life long ago in
British New Guinea —now Papua. Fish-
ing with a net in Tamata Creek, a fresh-
water effluent of the big Mamba River,
40 miles from the sea, he found among
the catch an unmistakable swordfish
about three feet long. Knowing that
there was a pukka freshwater species
found in the Ganges, he forwarded
the specimen to the South Kensington
Museum at great expense (among other
items a case of whisky was used for pre-
servative). Instead of a grateful reply say-
ing that the fish was a new and unique
species which would be named after him,
he received a curt intimation that the
specimen was a sea-going swordfish of a
very common variety. The letter reeked
with suspicion that writer had been
trying to pull South Kensington’s leg, and
applications for a refund of the postage
and the cost of the preserving fluid were
never answered. It was about this time
that the scribe got tired of zoology.
* * * *
“Broadwater”: Queensland has had
another visit from a blackfish, one of
those curious small whales whose habit
it is on occasion to rush furiously up
on a beach and then die in bad odor.
Last time it was Sandgate, at the north
end of Moreton Bay. This time it is
Southport, Sandgate’s loathed rival, some
50 miles south. In both cases the result
has been the same. The naturalists have
marvelled and the populace has wondered.
Then, as the corpse has begun to do its
own publicity work, local authority and
the health ditto have quarrelled furiously
as to whose job it was to remove it. The
books say that the peculiarity of the
ca’ing whale, as the Scots call it, is this
habit of rushing ashore singly or in
droves. None of them seems to have
noticed that it always picks crowded
seaside resorts in the height of summer
for its suicide.
* * *
“Cootharra”: Winnie, our pet euro
(Westralian rock kangaroo), had a liking
for softgoods. Her weakness was the
quilts on the verandah sleep-out beds.
Mum’s wrath was awful on finding all
the front-row tassels gone from a quilt
and Winnie lying on her best flower-bed
digesting them. Also the creature used
to invade the kitchen about breakfast-
time in search of a mutton chop, which
it stole when the cook’s back was turned
and ate in the middle of the lawn, hold-
ing the chop in both paws. Winnie’s day
commenced at daylight with furlong
sprints round the garden, with the home-
stead verandah as the straight. After a
wet night the verandah was a sight to
behold, and Mum’s regular threats were:
(1) To have Winnie shot. (2) To send her
to the Zoo. (3) To give her away to
friends in the city. But when one day
the gate of the garden was left open and
Winnie hopped out, never to return, Mum
was very quiet, and that night I heard her
sigh deeply.
* * * *
“Isee”: Sea-serpents? Some years ago
captain, crew and passengers of the Car-
lisle Castle reported having seen a huge
sea-snake when about half-way between
the Cape and Australia. About 30ft. could
be seen above water. Travelling at the
rate of about 10 miles an hour, with a
shooting motion, the snake soon passed
out of sight.
* * * *
“Frigid”: “Bob Sawyer” (B. 20/12/’33)
laughs at the notion that a bullet could
find its way through the opening of the
vermiform appendix. Can’t speak as to
bullets, but when Samson Segre, of W.Q.,
was operated on for appendicitis 15 gun
pellets were found in the appendix. Sam-
son came from sunny Italy and had a
passion for tinned bunny, so it was
assumed that he had swallowed pieces
of shot at various times when consum-
ing his favorite game. There were no
signs of puncture on the appendix, and
Segre was positive that nobody ever made
a target of his stomach.
CATERPILLARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There’s things you learn in Sunday school,”
my trusty friend the cocky said,
“However long a bloke may live he’ll always
carry in his head.
I’m thinking now of Exodus and all the misery
and woe
That Pharaoh brought upon himself before he
let them Hebrews go.
The Lord and Moses tried him high; they
raked old Egypt back and front;
What has me beat is why they never used the
caterpillar stunt.
“They covered all the land with frogs, a living
pest that’s foul and rank,
And when whole millions of ’em died the
blighters naturally stank.
They, tried him out with lice that fell like
clouds of dust on beasts and men;
A torment dire, for one suspects they hadn’t
insect powder then.
But, still ’n’ all,” the cocky said —his brow
was creased, his cheek was wan —
“I wonder that they never thought to switch
the caterpillars on.
“With swarms of buzzing flies they thought to
discipline that stiff-necked king,
And one can readily believe he found the curse
a grievous thing.
They dealt him locusts for his sins; in fact, they
harried him with more
Of those voracious insect-hosts than Egypt ever
saw before.
And yet it didn’t queer his pitch or break his
stubborn hardihood,
Or make the tyrant sky the towel —the same
as caterpillars would.”

He sadly sighed and slowly wiped the brow
beneath his battered lid,
And glanced toward his ravaged fields, my
trusty friend the cocky did.
“Ah, well,” he said, “perhaps they’d none of
these here scourges to be loosed
When Israel baked the Gyppos’ bricks and
good old Moses ruled the roost.
For if a plague like this had struck the land

“149”: The motor-car swagman has
made his appearance in Hawkes Bay,
M.L. He rolled up at our station at sun-
down and explained that he was petrol-
less and starving. The cook gave him a
handsome handout, although his car was
within eyeshot. “What about a spot of
benzine?” murmured the wanderer. The
cook said he’d have to ask the boss, who
hadn’t been giving rations of that sort
up to the moment. When the boss came
over the swagman was digging out an old
can to receive the petrol. The boss
(one of those strong, silent coves) looked
the new sort of Matilda-waltzer over with
a snaky eye and said: “Sorry, old chap,
but I’m not installing the free bowser
until next shearing. Call again, won’t
you?” The swagman filled his tank from
a bright new tin of his own and departed
murmuring bitter things about “blasted
capitalists.”
“Diamantina”: That yarn of the pet
kangaroo which went bush with a bell
round its neck (B. 3/1 / ’34) recalls an
“I’ve got a steady job with the Temp'ranee Society

“No; as a Nawful Example.”
experience of my own long ago when I
was trying to run down a blue doe for
her skin. The stirrup-leather and -iron J
was using to give the k.o. —I had no
dog—slipped out of my hand, the leather
going over her head. As she skipped
over an ironstone ridge, where my un-
shod nag couldn’t follow, the looped
leather was round her neck like a bando-
lier, with the stirrup-iron flapping
behind. Two years later, when travel-
ling with sheep down the Balonne, we
came on a fair-sized mob of kangaroos
beginning to feed at sunset. The sheep
didn’t disturb them, but as I rode up
the mob leisurely made olf. It was
then that I saw a large blue doe linger
behind her mates. The reason was
obvious; her joey, a big fellow, was
some way olf. He made hot-hop for his
mother, but, instead of going head-over-
heels into the pouch in the usual fashion,
he seemed to put one foot on her stomach
and so reach safety. Urging my horse
to a closer view I could see it was my
old Diamantina friend with the stirrup-
leather and -iron still in situ. Unable
to get rid of it, she had taught her
joeys to use it as a means of mounting to
the pouch when in a hurry.
“J.T.E.”: “Quad” (B. 13/12/’33) is a
little late with his suggestion that the
reindeer be given a Chance on M.L.’s
Alps. Some were freed there live or six
years ago. Neither they nor their off-
spring were seen until a little over 12
months ago, when a hunter observed
some remarkably line specimens through
his field-glasses. All attempts to get
within rifleshot failed {of course he
wanted to shoot them). Like most im-
portations, the reindeer have flourished
above all expectations. And they are not
likely to come down on the plains and
break farmers’ fences, as the Scottish
deer do.

“Walkabout”: An old Kalkadoon
native out Boulia way (W.Q.) bears

toes of a very narrow squeak. When all
the warriors of the tribe were away hunt-
ing, a few of the youngsters tried to make
rain. A frilled lizard was disembowelled
and buried stomach up beneath a drying-
up waterhole, with the “rain-stick” stuck
in alongside. No rain came, so it was
suggested that something bigger than the
lizard was needed. The weakling of the
party was grabbed, a grave was dug and
the disembowelling operation was begun
with a sharpened stone. The hunters re-
turned and stopped the proceedings before
the patient had lost his innards and his
life.

“Spare Sawbones”: “Jerry’s” farmer
who cut off his dog’s ears as an antidote
to scrub-tick poison (B. 27/12/’33) was
following a practice of wide repute
amongst countryfolk. It has a reasonable
basis, being a crude but expeditious way
of opening a vein to promote a free flow
of blood from the body. There is no
better emergency method of removing
poisons of all kinds from the system than
the letting of a pint or so of the blood,
as the mediaeval barber-surgeons well
knew. Once, when I was up against a
desperate case of strychnine poisoning,
I bethought me of the bushman’s remedy
and applied it in addition to the usual
ones —not, however, by cutting off the vic-
tim’s ear. The result was dramatic, con-
vulsions ceasing within a few. minutes.
The poisoned lad was so heated up by
the violence of his convulsion that clouds
of steam rose from his body, a thing I
have not seen in the case of humans
before or since.

“George”: I used to be New South’s
staunchest supporter of wax matches.
Couldn’t stand the wooden chaps. You
can’t wax a cigarette with a piece of
“Hey, boss, how can I find out how much milk she’s got in her tank?”
burning timber, and for lighting pipe
or cigarette on a windy day the vesta
wins hands down. But from now on I’m
off the wax standard. Last week we had
just pitched three tons of hay on to the
waggon when the load literally burst into
flames. Quick work by the boys got the
horses out. We had to break a saddle on
the offside shatter to get her free. After
trying in vain first to capsize the waggon,
and then to pull the frame and the load
off, we retired from the heat and watched
the lot go up in smoke. A wax match
is considered guilty. Probably one was
lying on or between the floor-boards and
rubbed into flame during the loading.

“Anthropophagus”: Re that Chinese
affair on Rossel (B. 3/1 / ’34), “Endiadere”
says William MacGregor inquired “most
closely” into that affair, and conducted
his inquiries on the spot. So did De
Rochas, who arrived at Rossel in the Styx
one month after the “accident” (Jan.,
1859). MacGregor did not visit Rossel
until 30 years later ; and, whereas Mac-
Gregor in all his three visits to Rossel
(1888, 1890 and 1892) got no definite in-
formation but only reached a fanciful
conclusion, De Rochas got his account
actually from the lone Chinaman who
survived and saw the spot where the
Chinese had been clubbed to death. The
Chinaman’s evidence was repeated
through an interpreter in Sydney. Inci-
dentally, Armstrong, a Cambridge ethno-
logist, who spent some months on Rossel
a few years ago and acquired a little of
the Rossel tongue (which MacGregor did
not understand), learned quite definitely
from the Rossel natives that the Chinese
had been killed and eaten. Frank
Osborne, the original white settler on
Rossel, and the only other white man to
acquire a smattering of the Rossel lan-
guage, was of the same opinion. In fact,
there is not a scrap of evidence to support
MacGregor in his fanciful notion that
316 Chinamen (that was the number) left
Rossel on rafts, abandoning, for some un-
known reason, one of their compatriots.

“Prof. Shingleshort”: Bathurst (N.S.W.)
folk are intrigued over the nativity of
a battalion of eels, ranging in length
from 4in. to Bin., which the other day
emerged from a butcher’s cellar and
slithered unconcernedly into an adjacent
channel. Ray Lankester records that Eng-
lish country folk “often catch plump eels
a couple of feet long in stagnant ponds,
hundreds of miles from the sea, far from
rivers and more than 1000 feet above sea
level,” and offers the explanation that
very young eels are prone to travel long
distances across wet grass with occasional
help from rain-filled rivulets. He men-
tions (without accepting) an alternative
reason in the belief held by villagers that
eels are produced by the vivification of
horsehair. As butchers store cattle hides
in their cellars, the vivification of cattle-
hair can now be added to the theory.
* * * *
“Rector”: Add to “Bush Chef’s” recipe
for grilling over a campfire (B. 3/l/’34)
that you should gather first of all a
number of green gum-leaves. Lay these
on the griller, set the chops on them and
cover with the rest of the leaves. The
leaves catch fire after a while, and the
fat melting from the meat feeds the fire
until cooking is completed. The flavor
of the eucalypt goes into the meat and
adds piquancy to the taste.
* * * %
“Exile”: “Avon’s” observation (B.
20/12/’33) that exiled Aussies have in-
troduced only bluegums to M.L., to trans-
plant a sniff of home, doesn’t apply to
modern Auckland. Aussies, Pig Islanders,
Hindoos, Chinese and the Railway De-
partment sow every known sort of
eucalypt with such determination that the
scenery is frequently blotted from view.
The city has public and private masses
of dozens of species, and is particularly
prone to spreading the short-legged
varieties with the crimson headgear. The
timber isn’t as sturdy as in the Aus-
tralian-grown tree, and many pests try
to eat it down, but you can get lovely
sniffs everywhere in the Shaky Isles. I
bought several penn’orths of assorted
eucalypt seed from a local nurseryman
years ago. Far from being all globulus,
the trees came up as various as blokes in
a Bagdad bazaar. My offspring, born in
M.L., pinching the pendulous leaves of
the gum saplings in the back paddock,
present the smell to their playmates and
solemnly say: “That’s where my dad
comes from.” By the way, when there’s
a bushfire in Australia and the wind
blows straight across the Tasman you can
smell it in Auckland.

“M.L.C.”: The Mexican Indians not
only use the ant as a clothes-cleaner (B.
8/11 /’33), but they heal bruises and swell-
ings with the honey taken from the honey
ant, which also is highly relished for
its sweet taste. It is this variety of
ants, found only in hot, dry climates,
which chooses certain youngsters soon
after they are hatched to act as living
casks. Stored with nectar they spend
their whole life hanging by their legs
from the roof in order that the com-
munity may survive a drought. As many
as 500 “casks” have been found hanging
side by side in one cellar. An experi-
menter who tried the effect of alcohol
on ants found that they reacted in a very
human manner. When those under the
influence interfered too far with the day’s
work their comrades cast them into a
pool of water, whence they emerged some
hours later none the worse. Since they
will survive a temperature of lOdeg.
below freezing for 24 hours and can be
starved for months with no ill effects,
ants may be classed as fairly hardy
insects.
THE SPECIMEN SHOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He’d a bit of stone in his pocket, and a shrewd
look in his eye,
When he yelled: “Hey, Joe, just a moment! ”
to me as I’m going by.
And he took me down to the corner, where
he had me on my pat,
And he pulled out the stone and whispered:
“Say, what do you think of that?”
I told him I had seen better, and worse, I
assured him, too.
But he broke in, still in a whisper, that this
was from something new:
“The best that’s been found in the district, at
least for many a day”;
But he couldn’t say where, for that would be
giving the show away.
And he wanted a bit of backing, and, knowing
me for so long,
He’d give me first offer of taking a chance that
couldn’t go wrong.
And as soon as he got some backing he’d be
off out there like a shot,
And, of course, the fellow who backed him
would be halves in all he got.
No, I didn’t go in with Sandy, but I told him
I thought it nice
Of him to make me the offer; then I gave
him some good advice.
I said, “Sandy, the stone you’ve got there its
age begins to betray;
It’s been so long in your pocket that the gold’s
getting worn away.”
And, of course, he was disappointed—that’s
putting it mildly, too —
For he told me where I could go to, and also
what I could do.
Oh, I let him see bright and early I was wise
to what he was at,
With a bit of stone in his pocket and a story
as old as that.

75 Years of National Service
THE history of the National Bank of Australasia
dates back to 1858, when the gold-digging boom
was at its height. The Bank took its share in the
activities of those stirring times, and, as the rich mines
became worked out, and the population directed its
energies to grazing, farming and manufacturing indus-
tries, it provided necessary financial facilities and
assisted in the expansion of production and trade.
During the years of land settlement, railroad extension
and increasing population, the National Bank main-
tained close contact with all sections of industry,
added widely to its establishment and improved the
facilities it afforded. Thus it linked itself to the pro-
gressive forces in the community and took its part in
the development of the Australian nation.
Its present establishment consists of 430 offices and
branches spread through the cities and country districts
of Australia, as well as two branches in London. In
addition, it is represented by well-known banking
houses in important trading centres the world over.

Parasites
Queensland seems to get rid of one
pest only to find itself entertaining
another. The latest is galvanised burr,
a vegetable which produces a seed as
clinging as a Mussulman’s sweetheart,
with spikes that are sharper than the
serpent’s tooth. The C.S.I.R. is look-
ing for parasites. In a generation or
two this country will possibly consist
entirely of parasites, with a politician or
two wedged into the desert spaces. No-
body will ever find a parasite which will
eat them out. —Oke.
A Matter of Fivepence Ha’penny
I suspect that a good deal of those
losses in the P.M.G.’s department may be
attributed to socialistic lack of initiative
and commonsense. On behalf of a cable
co. I once had to chase syd. due on a
telegram. Mountains of correspondence
passed between me and the P.M.G.’s
“foreign clerk.” Finally I went across
and interviewed him. It appeared the
money was owing by a woman living
somewhere at the Back of Beyond on a
cable to her son which had not been de-
livered because he had been killed. The
company’s proportion was twopence and
the P.M.G.’s three ha’pence, and I offered
for the co. to forego the charge, if the
P.M.G. did the same. The f.c. looked
up the regs. and decided that it
couldn’t be done, so the correspondence
went on. It was still going on when I
left for other parts. —C. Q. (Vic.).
Black Hand?
Some of those movie cos. which grind
out Hayseed pictures (B. 3 /1 / ’34) should
move up to North Queensland. Not long
ago we had bandit outrages galore in the
North, and now reports suggest that a
homely Sicilian atmosphere is developing
along the exotic Johnstone River front.
An Italian colonist with a name which
would fit well into an opera was shot at
from tall timber as he drove home from
town with his wife on a tramway trolley
last week. Now, the victim alleges that
somebody has asked him firmly for
£5OO. Rumors have reached the police
that a Black Hand gang is operating and
that it frequently exacts little presents
from Italian colonists who desire to keep
on living. The unromantic intelligence
department at Canberra, however, says
that the trouble looks more like a family
feud than terrorist activity.— lnnisfail.
The Emden
Adventures of the Emden bell (B.
10/1/’34) recall that, shortly after the
Sydney-Emden encounter, a project was
evolved for bringing the wreck to Austra-
lia. The Commonwealth Government was
prepared to take £2OOO for it, subject to
British approval, and received a deposit
of £lOO from ‘‘Jack” Higgins, M.L.C.,
the moving spirit in a syndicate which
proposed to exhibit the victim of the Syd-
ney’s gunfire in various Australian ports.
The enterprise might have been re-
munerative, but before the British Gov-
ernment could make up its mind on the
matter the Emden had gone down in the
sands so deeply that it would have had
to be blasted out, and the syndicate’s
enthusiasm waned. So all Australia has
seen is the bell of the vessel, although the
cracked relic has provided as much news-
paper copy as a whole warship might
have done. — Exdig (N.S.W.).
Holly woodese
Pronouncing our horsemen “the finest
in the world” (B. 10/l/’34) N.S.W.
Deputy Premier Bruxner held forth bit-
terly on the adulation of things Ameri-
can in Sydney and the tendency to sub-
stitute Hollywoodese or Wild West for
good Austral-English. He referred to
“blazing a trail,” deplored the fact that “a
mad bug” had attacked the Australian
outlook, and went on to tell how the
Australian stockmen didn’t use a lasso but
would “throw a cow with their bare
hands.” Australians don’t “blaze” trails,
though the American woodsmen did. In
Australian scrubs a “track” is “cut,”
while the overlander in new country
“opens up” yet another stock route. The
American “bug” does not afflict Austra-
lians, whatever it may do in Hollywood.
Lastly, no Australian ever refers to cattle
as “cows,” a peculiarly Wild West word
in this connection. To an Australian the
animal is a “beast,” whatever the sex. —
S.S. (N.S.W.).
Fanes and Memorials
Australian Ministries seem to have
an almost Latin craze for fanes
and memorials. The Sydney Anglican
cathedral proposal (B. 3/1 / ’34) is only
one case in point. Britain has been con-
tent to remember the men of 1914-18
with a simple pillar in a historic spot,
which has become the holiest and
most frequented war shrine in the
world. Paris has utilised a standing
memorial to cover its shrine. This
unpretentiousness has no counterpart in
Sydney and Melbourne. The Melbourne
memorial on an expensive site looks as
if the Goths had sacked the Humbert
and the Quadriga and glued the com-
bined remains together after taking away
the statuary and bronzes. The Sydney
memorial in Hyde Park, built of
Yankee artificial stone, is gloomy with
iron-barred windows, and slouching,
despondent figures sit in perpetual de-
jection, elbows on knees, like tramps
caught in the rain, round its upper para-
pet. In front, workmen are quarrying
out a sort of dam or tank, which
strangers will mistake for the local swim-
ming bath. —E. V. (N.S.W.).
The Communists
A constant reader of Russian propa-
ganda will get amusement from the
changes which have taken place in the
outlook of U.S.S.R. politicians following
U.S.A. recognition of the Seven Repub-
lics. Gentlemen who in the old blood-
thirsty days, when internationalism was
the cry and world revolution the slogan,
knocked about in Russian blouses and a
lot of hair have become shaven, wear
tailored suits and horn-rimmed glasses,
and cut:and brush;their hair. Litvinoff
looks like a respectable suburban house-
holder. Kalinin has acquired the air of
a Methodist preacher, and talks about
“an era of fruitful co-operation” with the
country of the not-so-almighty dahlar.
The limited Communist party, as was in-
evitable, already is resolving itself into
a highly-paid capitalist class —there is
even a cartoonist in Russia now who gets
a salary bigger than Low’s, and a couple
of thousand a year sterling is nothing for
engineers and departmental heads. The
capitalist Shakspeare has been restored
to favor, and the 17th Party Congress
rejoices, in Lenin’s name, at the “favor-
able international atmosphere of normal
diplomatic relations.” Perhaps the fact
that Soviet exports dropped 50 p.c.
between 1930 and 1932 has something to
do with it. The Spirit of Seventeen seems
to live nowhere but in Australia and
Asia, where decadent Agit-Prop, depart-
ments still serve up their hate-and-blood-
shed talk.— Gospodin (N.S.W.).

SELECTING THE TEAM.
Ever eager to be in the movement I
herewith weigh in with my English team.
An opening batsman with the ability
to break the bowlers’ hearts is the first
requirement. For this position Joe Lyons
picks himself. Joe is capable of break-
ing the heart of a working bullock; If
the umpires moved and carried a vote of
no confidence and tried to push him off
the field, he’d stay on
"Tough? Why, he shaves himself with a blowlamp.”
. Although his habit of being bowled out
is against him, Jack Lang must go. No
doubt even in England barrackers could
be secured to drown the umpire’s adverse
decisions with howls of “Lang Is Right.”
Judge Curlewis is indispensable for his
work in catching people out in slips—
grammatical ones.
Trautwein and Alam, Ms.L.C., de-
serve to be chosen if only on
account of their remarkable luck ; more-
over, the member who introduced fruit
machines should be able to give Lar-
wood and others the raspberry when re-
quired.
Jock Garden, a recognised champion
at getting politicians out, certainly merits
a trial.
As wicketkeeper I nominate George
Waite. He never lets anything get past
him without writing to the papers
about it.
There are still places to be filled, but I
know someone who can spare a mother-
in-law. A wife, too, for that matter. And
we can surely spare seven more politi-
cians.

Assisted by a regiment of Floor Captains

Asinine Theatres, Ltd., answered by
threatening to enlarge theatres in Cam-

A W.O.G. conference decided to issue
two dozen more gangsters per week to
A.T. A.T. doggedly bit the bullet and
built another 20 theatres, which W.O.G.
Co. supplied with U.S.A. college and war
pictures.
Both sides were pretty well all in when
the chief of the W.O.G. legions met the
boss of Asinine Theatres in a bar.
“Say,” said the former, “what’s that
herd of people pushin’ to get into the
joint outside?”
“That,” answered the A.T. boss, “is
the crowd that used to go to the talkies
fighting to see a stage play.”

THE “BODY IN THE TREACLE-TIN”
MYSTERY.
“All that the police know so far, I
understand,” said Shinhock Bones, “is
that the body was clad in shirt and wide-
bottomed trousers, head closely cropped,
fore and middle
fingers of the right
hand stained a deep
yellow. Obviously
a middle-aged
sailor with a nag-
ging wife and large
; family, and ad-
dicted to strong
drink”
“But” began
Dr. Watsthis.
“But me no buts,
my dear Watsthis.
I will anticipate
y our inevitable
questions and
answer them in the
Socratic manner.
The nicotine-
stained hand be-
speaks the heavy
smoker, and the
heavy smoker is one who craves a seda-
tive for his frayed nerves. Do you know
of anyone, Watsthis, whose nerves are
worse than those of a man with a nagging
wife and big family? , And who but a
sailor would wear bell-bottomed trou-
sers? Added confirmation is given when
one recalls that sailors invariably wear
their hair close-cropped. The chain of
evidence is complete! ”
“I was going to tell you when you in-
terrupted,” explained Watsthis, “that
Inspector Blobb has definitely established
the identity of the victim. Norma Binx
is the name —a flapper clad in slacks
who was a well-known member of the

No fear!

“I haven’t a little girl, dear.”
“How is your little boy?”
“I haven’t a little boy either."

“Percy de Malmanche broke the world
machine-shearing record in a Taranaki shed,
putting through 412 Romney ewes in ten
hours.”— M.L. paper.
Percy, old pal, they’ve laughed at you
for years,
Depicting you as vapid, dolled and
curled ;
Now take your due—three hearty British
cheers,
And the proud title, Ringer of the
World!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Coonamble pastoralist G. B. S. Falk-
iner has a tophole galloper in Canegrass.
Starting as a picnic performer in western
N. S. Wales last season, Canegrass won
his first nine races in succession, was
second on three occasions and now has
won four in a row. He was brought to
the metropolis with Captain Rado. He
romped in at Kembla Grange, and in
the Berala Handicap at Warwick Farm,
starting at 12 to 1, he beat many smart
sprinters. Charalf and Queue filled the
places, but did not trouble him when
pressure was put on.
Canegrass was not broken in until he
was a five-year-old; he is rising seven
now. He cost his owner 35 guineas
along with a draught horse. He is by
Orby’s Pride (sire of Orby Anthus) from
Bluegrass. A half-brother, Venetian
King, was a good performer in Westralia.
The “Smithden” combination paid
1000 guineas as a yearling for Cherbourg,
who is closely related to the Melbourne
Cup winner Nightmarch, and found him
unreliable. He is now held under lease
by Randwick trainer G. Price. Backed
from sixes to 7 to 2, Cherbourg won the
January Handicap from the favorite,
Stonebrook, and Magnetic, who met with
interference in running and went wide

turning for home. Cherbourg has 6st.
101 b. in the Anniversary, and as he came
from behind on Saturday he is a possi-
bility.
Chiefava has been performing consist-
ently of late. Miss Nottava’s sister,
backed from sixes to 7 to 2, carried off
the Farm Novice after a great struggle in
the last furlong with Captain Rado and
Kenya Green. Knox rode a superb race
on the little chestnut; he cleared out at
the turn, got a winning break and never
let up. Captain Rado may have beaten
him with a bit of luck in running. He
lost ground at the six furlongs, and gave
Chiefava a big start from the turn. He
is worth following, as in the bush he
had a victory over Canegrass.
Randwick trainer Bailey Payten cap-
tured a double —with Thaddeus (14 to 1)
in the first division of the Maiden, and
Imitate (9 to 2) in the Nursery. Imitate
is bred to gallop ; he is by Baralong (sire
of Bombus) from a Magpie mare, Mimic,
a sister to Corinax, an Auckland Cup
winner; his granddam, Queen Ingoda,
is a sister to King Ingoda, a Melbourne
Cup winner. Imitate was backed from
twelves.
The Adrian Knox Stakes has been a
good race for Rosehill trainer Booth.
Judging by Leila Vale’s success in the
Sefton Handicap, at 8 to 1, she is going
to be hard to defeat on Anniversary Day.
Gloriole was a hot favorite, but she is
evidently feeling the strain of recent
racing, as she had had enough after
passing the three furlongs. An outsider,
Akuna, having her first run since a holi-
day, came home well to get second place,
and is worth following in future events
over a bit of a distance. Little Bill
Wedgewood beat Camargo for the minor
placing; the latter would have been
troublesome but for getting caught in
the barrier. Leila Vale is by Heroic
from Maltgilla, dam of Tregilla and Bur-
wood.
Monte Video (5 to 1), a four-year-old
chestnut gelding by Spelthorne from
Noonbinnia, annexed the second division
of the Maiden from El Toro and Bela-
galah. He was bought at auction (for
seven guineas) with a view to being sent
to Asia, but Randwick trainer Hush liked
the look of the gelding and leased him.
His dam, Noonbinnia, was a well-known
performer, and is by Popinjay from Crail,
by Traquair.
Though a tornado had blown the roof
o ff the Leger shelter stand at Epsom
on the previous Sunday the meeting there
] as t week-end was held in delightful
sunny weather. Melbourne has been
through the gamut of climatic changes
lately, but the population is accustomed
to that sort of thing. Secretary J. L.
Reilly, who also has the biggest financial
interest in the Epsom course, smiled
widely as the turnstiles clicked to admit
swarms of patrons.
• * * ' '
But the class of horses engaged in seven
races was poor. Weights in the principal
event (the January Handicap, H miles)
were headed by Balkan King, who is
only moderate. Gay Girl started at 10
to 1 ; it was her first victory for the
season. This mare did her early racing in
South Aus., where she was bred by
R. E. H. Hope. Gay Girl is by King of
Mirth (son of Comedy King) from
Temple Bell, who traces back to the
granddam of Wallace.
Brilliant Star, trained locally by Freed-
man for Morrie Jacobs, a Geelong
draper, was made favorite for the January
Handicap, with Sol Green’s Alaric next
in demand. Barren Corn, who won the
Grafton Cup and other N.S.W. races
last season, and came to Melbourne
from Brisbane, gave indications of suc-
cess in the near future by striving to
lead from start to finish. The Dignity
gelding tired half a furlong from home
and was beaten for third by Sordino, a
recent winner at Geelong. Gay Girl took
charge when Barren Corn compounded.
She stalled off a late challenge from
Alaric and scored by three-quarters of
a length. Alaric seemed too much of a
handful for apprentice Godby ; he needs
vigorous riding. Godby tried to get
through on the rails and then had to
shift to the outside of Gay Girl. Being
only three years old, there is plenty of
time yet for Alaric to make a name for
himself. The colt is by Gothic from Fox
Berry (imp.), by Son-in-Law from Alope,
by Gallinule.
The opening event on the card was
appropriated by Bardinet, a filly bred in
N.S.W. by Mrs. Hunter White, and
bought for 110 guineas as a yearling by
two sons of the late A. E. Tyson, who
had Carbinier at his stud on the Mur-
rumbidgee, near Hay. At Moonee Valley
on December 23 Bardinet, going out at
50 to 1 in the juvenile race, came from
the clouds to finish a head behind the
second horse. Backers made her a warm
favorite on Saturday, and Bardinet more
than justified expectations; she scored,
running away, by five lengths from Cool-
art, owned by J. S. Feehan, of the V.R.C.
committee. R. D. O’Donnell, who pre-
pared Balloon King for a Victorian
Derby victory in 1930, trains Bardinet.
He has two other youngsters in hand for
the Tyson brothers, but neither has faced
the starter yet.
First division of the Trial Stakes re-
sulted in a clear-cut victory for Septima
(Crowdennis —Sylk Arto). This four-
year-old gelding was bred by A. F.
Collins, proprietor of a Melbourne music
warehouse, and is raced by him in con-
junction with R. N. McLean, of Sydney.
The turf association of Collins and Mc-
Lean began several seasons ago, and has
been fortunate. They won the Albury
Cup and Wagga Cup with Chariot, be-
sides the Grantham Stakes at Randwick
with Solitas. Second money in Septima’s
race was earned by Dusky Queen, who
belongs to Alan Currie, of the V.R.C.
committee. Next division of the Trial
Stakes saw Sable (Ethiopian—Radesia)
vanquish the 10-to-9 favorite, Martha-
guy. V.R.C. chairman L. S. K. Mackin-
non bred Sable, who is held on lease
by Charles Cooper, a crack lightweight
jockey of former days. Cooper piloted
many winners for Mackinnon, including
Oreillet (Maribyrnong Plate) and lolaire
(Williamstown Cup).
Luck was against Skidmore at Epsom.
He registered three seconds —on Coolart
in the Two-year-old Handicap, on Mar-
thaguy in the first division of the Trial
Stakes, and on Kitty O’Shea in the Welter
Mile. It was through no fault of the
jockey that these horses suffered defeat.
Kitty O’Shea struck her colors to Law
Court, a 15-to-l chance, who led all the
way. Law Court was ridden by Elliott,
Phar Lap’s pilot in the Agua Caliente
Handicap. Law Court is by Double
Court, a son of Bachelor’s Double, the
dam being by Trafalgar from Littawa.
by Soult. Little Queen, a three-year-old
filly by Verbius from Yellow Mountain,
landed the Epsom Purse in good style.
Her dam raced over fences and is a half-
sister to Jack Rice, one of the best
jumpers that N.S.W. has produced. La
Scala won the Epsom Plate impressively.
She is by Manfred from Frances Tres-
sady. Both sire and dam are on the
scroll of Victoria Derby winners, and
La Scala promises to prove worthy of her
lineage.
* * * *
Sydney’s City Tatt.’s Club is losing its
secretary, Owen Maidment, who is re-
signing. Maidment took over the reins
from the late Frank Walton and made
good. The reason for his resignation is
not given, but it is supposed to be a
result of a bit of financial-emergency
legislation with which he did not agree.
Depresh has been hard on some of these
clubs.
* * * *
About the youngest handicapper in
Australia is lan Keast, who fixes the
weights for the Newcastle, Wyong and
Kembla Grange clubs. When not mak-
ing handicaps he is a clerk in the A.J.C.
office. The young man is a walking en-
cyclopaedia on turf matters. *
Not only Heroic, Windbag, Manfred
and Whittier, but Australian-bred horses
whose deeds on the turf were humble,
are showing up on the sires’ list. Calver-
hero, a recent winner at Randwick, and
Paddora, who is doing notable things at
mid-week meetings, are by Australian
sires: the former is by Cloud (The
Welkin—Tadanga). Cloud won a Carlton
Mile at Moorefield, beating Woodville
and Atholdorus. Calverhero is trained
at Menangle and is raced by the
Curry brothers, who have Lancaster
King. Another promising local sire is
Bicolor, brother to Windbag. Bill
Wedgewood is keeping his name in the
limelight.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: Isaac McShortodds, as illegal
as Flossie for 40 years in South Aus.,
hardly knows what to make of his new
freedom. For the first week or two he
wailed that backers had hit him hard.
Then Lady Luck intervened on his be-
half. What sort of chances rolled home
at Morphettville may be judged from the
fact that four inspired pickers of a double
got the staggering return, for £l, of
£1875! Thus far Isaac is not allowed
to handle doubles in South Aus. He is,
of course, at Randwick. There, some
of him have a 50-to-l limit, and very
little of that.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
McHugh reopened the Newtown
Olympia with a fifteen-rounder between
Jimmy Purcell and “Red” Maloney, of
Melbourne. Purcell won on points. He
is a likely lightweight, and the crowd was
pleased with the fight, though not alto-
gether with the decision, which was
correct, all the same.
* * * *
On past performances at Leichhardt
Clarke looked sure to beat Beth, but
Clarke had an “off” night or something
and lost. There were three falls and
Beth gained two. The combatants’ share
of the gate will not add materially to the
imports, visible or invisible, of their
great country.
Ins and Outs
Thanks to Oxenham, who took 6
wickets for 48, Queensland dismissed
S.A. for 184 (Richardson 67) on a bats-
man’s wicket at Brisbane ; and thanks to
Cook (156, run out), it had a first-innings
lead of 133.

The Metropolitan - Country cricket
match in Sydney ended in a draw with-
out bringing to light any new stars.
Country had the bad luck to strike a
sticky wicket at the Cricket Ground, and
all went for 65. Bennett, the Mosman
right-hand medium bowler, took 5 for 16,
and Walsh, the Glebe left-hander, 4 for
28. The home side tacked up 191, Wal-
lace top-scoring with 63. Bay (4-34) and
Robinson (3-32), both Newcastle men,
bowled well. Country’s second try
yielded 296 for 9 (declared). Black, of
Orange, who batted nicely in the first
innings, again came to light, this time
with 59. Robinson (76) and Lees (72)
also got among the runs. Metropolitan
lost 2 for 106, playing out time.

“Aigburth”: England waited until they
were dead before erecting monuments to
Nelson, Haig and others. This is not to
happen in the case of Jack Hobbs, who
is to have one up during his lifetime.
Surrey County is remodelling the Oval,
and ornate new entrances will be dedi-
cated to the great batsman. There is a
stand dedicated to Victor Trumper at
Sydney Cricket Ground, and at Lord’s the
memory of W. G. Grace is also honored
with a gateway of ceremony. Colin Blyth,
of Kent and England, killed in the war,
lives again in a fine statue at Canterbury,
and there are doubtless other examples.

Racquet and Bawl
The N.S.W. country tennis champion-
ships in Sydney provided a feast for W-
B. Walker, of Hawkesbury. He retained
his singles title by beating Moore, and
in partnership with the latter took the
doubles from the holders, Kalms and
Carson. In company with Mrs. Turn-
bull, Walker went on to win the mixed
doubles from Kalms and Miss O Donnell.
(<Continued on next page.)
After beating Oldham in Lancashiie
38-5, the Kangaroos played another ex-
hibition match against “England” in the
R.U.-Soccer stronghold of Newcastle and
lost 19-14. This was their last match.
The tally for the tour is 37 played, 2/
won, 10 lost; points scored, 754 to 301.

In the N.S.W. championships Melcalfe,

N.S.W. scored an outright win over
South Australia in their Sydney Shield
match, but this was due as much to the
poor showing of the visiting batsmen as
to any overwhelming superiority on the
home side. South Australia started its
second knock 27 runs behind, but
could only manage 177 against unimpres-
sive bowling. Ryan played a steady
innings for 56, and was helped by Collins
(36 n. 0.) and Waite (22). O’Reilly got
Nitschke’s wicket early, but otherwise
was ineffective. Theak again bowled well,
taking 3 for 43, while Chipperfield dis-
lodged three of the tail-enders. Chilvers
(2-43) did not enhance any Australian
Eleven prospects he may have.
Wanting 151 to win, Ma got them and
three over for the loss of Brown’s wicket.
The ex-Queenslander played a fine shot
for 83. Fingleton was 58, and Bill 10.
The win gives Ma 16 points to Vic-
toria s 19. If the home side can beat
Victoria outright in the Sydney match
beginning next week the Shield remains
in Sydney.
* * * *
Shabash Wallah”: Jardine and his
minions got through the second Test
against India at Calcutta without casualty,
though there was some promiscuous
bombing and shooting, at a match on the
other side of Bengal. India made 247 and
237 after following on. As England’s first
innings score was 403, the tourists needed
only 82 runs to win. They got seven of
them for the loss of two wickets when
stumps were drawn and the match.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: It is likely that the
Westralian cricketers, who had arranged
to play in Adelaide and Melbourne, may
come on for games in Sydney and New-
castle in February, taking part in fur-
ther matches in the southern capitals on
their way home. Well-known names in
the Westralian side are Bryant, who cap-
tained Westralia against England last
year, scoring 35, 0 and 12 n.o. ; Taafe,
who played against Gilligan’s team at
Brisbane with an Australian Eleven ; and
Inverarity, a slow bowler, who was in
Sydney with the last Westralian side to
come this way. Fast-bowler Halcombe
cannot come.
* * * *
Tamar”: One of the finest bowlers
Australia has produced, E. A. Mc-
Donald, is retiring to become manager of
Raike’s Hotel, a noted hostelry in Black-
pool. The bowling of McDonald and
Gregory with the 1921 team in England
made an impression on cricket there
which still endures, the combination prov-
ing the most formidable seen since the
great days of Turner and Ferris. That
season McDonald took 15Q wickets for a
15.97 average, and Gregory 106 for 14.56.
In all Tests McDonald took 33 wickets at
32.12 apiece. After that tour McDonald
returned to play League cricket in Lan-
cashire, and later, for the county, was
the chief instrument in the Red Rose’s
success in winning the championship for
three years in succession. McDonald was
a Tasmanian product, and after playing
with East Melbourne and Fitzroy clubs
soon found his way into the big stuff.
* * * *
“Huon”: That reference to Badcock
(B. 10/1/’34) reminds me that the young
Tassie batsman last week broke his own
record for the Speck, when he scored
1000 runs for the season in first-class
and club cricket for the third year in
succession. His total for the season, 1187,
is his highest to date, and his average 170.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Board of Control is
passing round the hat to meet the pre-
liminary expenses of dispatching the Aus-
tralian Eleven. Costs have been estimated
at £4485, with another £195 for chicken-
feed. The assessments show that South
Australia, Victoria and N.S.W. will pay
£1035 and £35 apiece. Queensland must
fork out £690 and £3O, while Westralia
and Tassie are let off with £345 and £l5
each.
“The Hove”: The amiable A. E. R.
Gilligan is as well known as a free talker
as he is as a free batsman. Speaking at
a cricket function in England the other
day, he referred to his county of Sussex
as being the cradle of cricket. The state-
ment will certainly arouse Hampshire
men to fury, but there is something in
the claim. For centuries —up to recent
years, at any rate —Sussex was renowned
for its ability at stool ball, a very ancient
British game in which the women are
as adept as the men. Many qualified to
speak insist that stoolball was the original
form of cricket, and, if that be so, Sussex
wins, and Gilligan, like Lang, is right.
Racquet and Baw!
“Cut Shot”: The seeding of the players
for the Australian tennis championships
in Sydney sees Crawford top the list,
with Perry next. Then comes McGrath,
promoted over Hopman. In view of his
two recent defeats of Perry, the distinc-
tion has been earned. Quist follows Mc-
Grath, and then come Hopman, Lee,
Hughes and Moon. In the doubles, Perry
and Hughes are rated first, with Craw-
ford and Hopman, Quist and Turnbull,
and McGrath and Moon following in that
order.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: The Australian tennis
team to meet England in the fourth Test
“Darn it, Joe; that last one must have been a whopper. He’s took me bait, line
an’ sinker.”
at Adelaide will include Crawford, fresh
from his spell. His return has been some-
what discounted by the omission of Mc-
Grath ; the selection committee rightly
considers that a turn on the ice will
do the boy no harm after his heavy
season, including the Australian cham-
pionships in Sydney. Turnbull comes in
to fill the N.S.W. player’s place. He will
partner Quist in the doubles, while the
old firm of Crawford and Hopman will
be the other couple.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Australian tennis
heads have formally decided to chal-
lenge for this year’s Davis Cup in the
European zone. The team will leave
Melbourne by the Orford on March 20,
the Australian XI travelling by the same
boat.' This year’s tour will be much
easier, following on the elimination of a
number of the European entrants by the
knockout competition played at the end
of last season, this considerably lessen-
ing the amount of travelling to be done.
The selectors of the team will be the
same as last year—Brookes, Clemenger,
Malcolm and Norman Peach.
“Rev. Knucklebone”: A horrible hul-
labaloo arose among Australian tennis
players last week, especially the feminine
element, when the N.S.W. tennis authori-
ties, who are running the Australian
championships in Sydney, announced that,
while they couldn’t exactly ban them,
they strongly disapproved of players
figuring in the tourney wearing shorts.
Quist, Hopman and Mrs. Molesworth
have taken to the sensible garments, and
all say they have experienced a freedom
from restraint not found with long
flannels or skirts. Hopman says he will
play in them anyway, and there are
mutinous murmurs from other quarters.
The objection to the things is that
they “lower the dignity of the game,”
to quote one official. No one thought of
that some 40 or 50 years ago when
players of the calibre of the Renshaws,
Lawford and other English cracks habitu-
ally turned out in knickers.
* * :(:
“S.T.S.”: Youth is having its innings
in S.A. sport. With Turnbull and Quist
away, Schwartz (20) showed himself the
best man in Adelaide tennis ; and Mary
Chapman (21) put an end to Miss
Le Messurier’s 10-years’ domination on
the women’s side.
* * * *
“Milton”: Queensland’s contingent for
the Australian tennis championships in
Sydney left this week to get in early for
some practice on the Rushcutter Bay
courts. Gar Moon will be the big chief
of the men, and in the doubles is to
partner McGrath. Goodwin and R. O.
Cummings, the other members of the
men’s party, have yet to sort themselves
out. Of the women, Mesdames Moles-
worth and Westmacott will team in the
doubles, and the pair that beats them will
know that it has been travelling. Mrs.
Westmacott will link up with Quist in
the mixed doubles.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Tilden invited a world-
wide raspberry when he recently pub-
lished his idea of the world’s best ten
tennis players, and he got an enthusiastic
response from every quarter. Bill’s lot
are: Cochet, Brookes, Lacoste, Nusslein,
Johnston, Richards, Williams, Borotra,
Barnes and Kozeluh. - It is characteristic
of the man that four of the ten are
Americans, including Barnes, who never
rose above the fifth class in his amateur
career. Williams is another Yank with-
out the slightest pretension to a throne in
that hierarchy, while the German Nuss-
lein is just a selling-plater. Tilden’s own
partner in many Davis , Cup victories,
Hunter, has been ignored, though many
would put him before Johnston and
Richards. The surprise omission is Wild-
ing, one of the greatest players in singles
and doubles alike the game has seen.
Tilden himself has as good a claim to
mention as any of them, but his charac-
teristic modesty probably kept him silent
here.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Carnoustie”: One indication of the
wide spread of the golf fever in Aus-
tralia to-day is the number of competent
professionals. A few years ago hardly
a club boasted a pro. that was not im-
ported, usually from Scotland. To-day
the land is full of the native-born and
-trained variety, and a mighty good lot
they are. These reflections are induced
by the news from Brisbane that 34 appli-
cations have been received for the job of
leading pro., being vacated by Charley
Brown, at the Goodna club. Goodna is
one of the best-organised clubs in
Bananaland, and its course probably
comes nearer to Australian championship
requirements than any other in the Bris-
bane district.
* * * *
“Aerodrome”: The cabled news that
St. Andrews has decided on a case*of a
player’s ball being moved on the putting
green recalls a golfing incident in which
I played a part at Heliopolis during the
war. The greens there were sand, of
course, and my opponent and myself both
made short pitches within a couple of
feet of the hole. We were amazed as
we walked up in the fading twilight—
play was only possible from about 4 to
6 p.m. in that blazing sand —to see one
of the stationary balls suddenly come
to life and roll into the tin, the other
remaining where it pitched. When we
reached the green we found that one of
the multitudinous scarab beetles which
infest the sand had mistaken my ball
for the one he had been rolling up for
his own private ends, and, travelling
backwards, as usual, had tumbled into
the tin with it. Of course I claimed the
hole, and my opponent was equally sure
that he had the right to it. We talked
the matter out after mess, and the con-
sensus of opinion was that we should
send the story to St. Andrews and ask
for a ruling. I regret to say that from
that day to this we have never received
the courtesy of a reply.
* * * *
“Delia”: Most golfers have stories
to tell about dogs who find lost balls,
very often when they are not lost. The
secretary of Brisbane’s municipal links,
A. E. White, has a super-dog—of course,
an Alsatian. When a ball goes into the
rough, the sec. is appealed to. It is no
use asking the dog unless the boss orders
him to do so. Once he gets on the trail,
however, he proves a most discriminating
tyke. His owner tells him what is wanted
in ordinary conversational tones.
“Kim,” as the dog is named, goes out and
finds the ball at once. If he finds two
in close proximity, say a “purple stripe”
and a “green checquer,” he brings back
the brand he is told to get, leaving the
other there until a request for its return
is made. At least that’s what they say in
Brisbane, where I have always found
golfers as truthful as elsewhere.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: It may be that East and
West can never meet, but East and South
have something in common. The golf-
ball-stealing crow has brought about the
community of interests. The club in
storied Bagdad is thinking of putting up
the shutters because of the expense caused
by the depredations of the sooty thieves.
It was only recently that the thieving
began. For some years the game went on
without the crows attempting to interfere.
Then the epidemic started, and the birds
are now so bold that they try to get the
spare balls out of the ball pockets in

advanced, but my own is that some of
the birds have got hold of a Bulletin

of country correspondents. The Asiatic
crow is an intelligent fowl —even more so
than his Aussie cousin—and quick to
take a hint.

“The McHaggis”: The N.S.W. dorp of
Wagga has been making golf history. A
Wagga golfer was putting when his ball
moved. His opponent claimed the
penalty, but the player objected, claiming
he was exempt since he had not grounded
his putter in addressing the ball. Argu-
ment ran high, and finally the matter
was referred to St. Andrews. The Royal
and Antient has found in favor of the
player, since he had not grounded his club
in addressing the ball. Rule 12, Subsec.
4, is clear on the subject. It begins: “If
a ball in play moves after the player has
grounded his club in the act of addressing
it....the penalty shall be one stroke.”
What happens before grounding doesn’t
matter.

inhabitant runneth not to the contrary,

“Pincher”: Yankeedom can’t get out
of its old habit of claiming inventions
as its own which other people origi-
nated. The steamboat, the telephone, the
incandescent light, all originating in
Britain, are cases in point. Now comes
news that American motoring interests
are preparing to swamp the world and
wipe out British competition with stream-
lined cars driven off the rear axle.
Streamline designs have been a common-
place in Britain and on the Continent for
the past three years. To the writer’s
knowledge, the Crossley people have had
an efficient rear-engine car on the
market for some time, and other British
makers are experimenting with the idea.
Germany is another country which has
a couple of makes of the rear-driven car

“Kick Starter”: Though the Isle of
Man Tourist Trophy races are on for
June, no word of the actual date has
come to Australia at lime of writing,
though full information is usually to
hand in December. Until news from
England, the closing date for Australian
nominations cannot be fixed. It is known
that the Government of Man has this
year reduced its subsidy to the English
A.C.U. This means that the help afforded
by the latter to Australian entrants must
be considerably reduced. Last year the
grant was a full one for the first rider
(Pringle) and half for the second
(Weatherby). This time it is unlikely that
more than one man will be invited.

“Formula”: The tiny engine of the
motor-cycle develops much more power
than most people wot of, its power-
weight ration being far above that of the
car engine. Some surprising speeds have
been put up on English tracks of late by
motor-cycle engines. One advantage the
cycle has over the car, however, is the
small frontal area exposed to wind re-
sistance, while the loss of power in trans-
mission to the driving wheel is much
smaller in the solo cycle than in the car.

“Albert Park”: Some of the promoters
of the sporting events which are intended
to grace Melbourne’s centenary are be-
ginning to wonder if they haven’t been
speaking out of their turn. The profes-
sional cycling people had a great idea of
bringing out some of the best of the Con-
tinental riders, professional cycling being
up to putty among Britons. The king of
these, Ledocq, twice winner of the Tour
de France, was invited. He has accepted
conditionally on £5OO being paid down
and return fares and all expenses for
himself and wife being added. Others
who have been asked to come along have
not yet replied. Taking Ledocq as a line,
the promoters are hoping to heaven they
won’t.

“Roller”: Hubert Opperman is due to
leave Melbourne for the Old Dart on
February 6. He is out to attack the
record for the ride of 866 miles from
Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’
Groats in Scotland. Rossiter, of England,
has the best time at present, this being
61hr. 22min. Given decent weather con-
ditions, “Oppy” should have little trouble
in cracking this on the perfect British
roads. He has ridden the 565 miles from
Svdney to Melbourne in 39hr. 42min.

“Hamilton”: As expected, Queensland
mopped up the Australian 16ft. sailing
championship sailed on the Brisbane
River. The winning boat was Victor 111,
sailed by that artist with the tiller Victor
Lucas. Aloha, which came all the way
from Westralia to compete, made a good
impression but failed to foot it with
Lucas’s Speedy craft. Lucas has won the
title on each of the three recognised
courses —Perth in 1925-26; Sydney,
1931-32; and Brisbane this year. He
has also taken six Queensland titles, and
is the outright winner of cups and
trophies innumerable.
“Spinnaker”: South Australia has not
figured prominently in the Australian 18-
footer championships, but a citizen of
that State, O. J. O’Grady, is inviting all
and sundry in Sydney sailing circles to
tread on the tail of his coat in an inter-
state sweepstakes on Sydney Harbor next
January. He is to build a special craft,
and offers to take on four Sydney boats
at once. The stake is to be £lOO per boat,
and the race is to be sailed in three heats,
with points allotted for placings. Orlando
Taylor, a leading 18ft. enthusiast, has
taken up the defi., and will build a new
boat.

“Shell”: It is possible that Australia
may see Bobby Pearce defending his title
ot world’s champion professional sculler
on his home waters. In a letter to his
dad Bob mentions having received ex-
Mayor Hagon’s invitation to come; to
Sydney. He adds that his flat terms will
be £5OO, win, lose or dead-heat, two
return tickets to Australia and back and
all expenses during the trip and in this
country. Pearce also says that he is
willing to meet any Australian sculler
who cares to come along to the Canuck
National Exhibition next August and
September. He names Turner—Austra-
lian amateur champion—Burns or Fisher.
Challengers will have to dump 500 dollars
(Canadian) with the C.N.E. if they mean
business. Bob’s employers, Dewars, have
already lodged his stake.
“Amateur Pro.”: One of the last
strongholds of lilywhite amateurism for
many years has been rowing. Until the
rules were altered a few years ago no
one who could be described as an
“artisan” —that is, a worker in some form
with his hands —could hope to rank as an
amateur in Britain. When the N.S.W.
crew which won the Grand Challenge
Cup at Henley in 1912 reached England,
many rowing potentates were staggered
at the rumor that one of the “Colonials”
was a mere policeman. It took a lot of
diplomacy to get the entry accepted, and
even political influence had to be brought
to bear. Later the English rule was
amended to allow all “artisans,” save
those connected with the boatbuilding
and kindred trades, to row as amateurs.
This has been the rule in Australia until
lately, but even that is likely to go over-
board shortly as the result of a postal
vote now being taken among the rowing
States.

“Crayfish”: In spite of much talk and
determination to die in the last ditch
sooner than have women included in the
Australian team for the Empire Games
in London in August, the militants splut-
tered out like wet squibs when it came to
a show-down at the meeting of the Games
Association in Sydney. Women will be
included, and, since this will let loose on
the other competitors a couple of
swimmers in the world’s champion class,
including Claire Dennis, the Olympic title-
holder, this may be a good thing for
Australia. It is regrettable that sculling
is not to be included on the programme.
Australia would have done well here,
since many good judges consider the Aus-
tralian champion, Turner, as little inferior
to Bobby Pearce.

“Ink”: The prejudice against the
player-writer in sport is growing. He has
been banned in cricket and football, and
Queensland wants him banned by the
athletic sports authorities. The Australian
championships, held this year at Adelaide,
will be accompanied by the biennial meet-
ing of the Australian Athletic Union. The
Bananalanders will ask that no one tak-
ing part in athletic sports be permitted
to write about them, save those people
who are journalists by profession. The
Queenslanders also desire the elimination
of walking from the programme; and
here they are assured of enthusiastic
public support. N.S.W. is to make an
important move in asking that Australian
records be granted for all events in which
world’s records are recognised. At
present the Australian heads take no
notice of events not on the official pro-
-Bram
“J. Hop”: A notable athletic event
looming in the near future is the Police
Olympiad, which comes off in Sydney on
February 17. Every State in Australia
is sending along a contingent of rozzers
to compete, and Maoriland is also con-
tributing, three Dominion champions with
an eye on the shot putt, hammer throw
and 100 yards championships having
nominated. The shot and hammer events
have long been a practical monopoly
for members of the “foorce” in the dif-
ferent States, and the All Blacks will have
to produce something out of the box to
take the titles home. Recent recruiting
has also brought many fine trackmen
into the N.S.W. force, notably Golding,
the Olympic rep., and Larnach-Jones, an
ex-G.P.S. champion.

“Birkenhead Park”: In spite of the
howls of protest, O wen-Smith, the South
African Test cricketer now at Oxford,
has been chosen to play full-back for
England in the first international match
of the Rugby season against Wales at
Cardiff on January 20. Though there
have been many precedents for
“Colonials” playing with British interna-
tional teams, there is a general feeling that
the practice should cease. In cricket, no
one who has played for one country can
turn out for another. For the sake of
consistency the rule should apply to all
sports, including athletics, in which a
Maorilander, Lovelock, after running
consistently for England in international
matches, yet stripped for M.L. at the last
Olympiad.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 21.
A Kooyonga Kaleidoscope.
Though not the oldest of the South
Australian golf clubs—it was founded
about 10 years ago—Kooyonga yields the
palm to pone, not even Royal Adel-
aide, with its h.q. at Seaton. A fly in the
Kooyonga beer, however, is the fact that
it has not yet had the privilege of staging
an . Australian championship, one that
ea t on l? as hitherto enjoyed. A step
in that direction was taken in 1932, when
.® P°W'^ rs that de graciously accorded
il the right to be used as a championship
course by the L.G.U.
The course, which is 6358 yards in
length, is one of the best-equipped in
Australia, and the clubhouse is worthy
of it. The chief professional is Rufus
Stewart, an Australian and State cham-
pion, who has figured with credit in the
British open championship.
The story of Kooyonga would be in-
complete without a reference to the Rymill
family Rymill pere was one of the leaders
m the foundation of the club and has given
devoted service to its interests. Son W.S.
has twice won the State championship ;
sister Kate scored in the 1932 fight for
the women s title ; that same year the
pair carried off the Australian mixed
foursomes. A golf club is laid in the
cradle of every new member of the
family as soon as may be after birth.
Leading the Kooyonga cavalcade be-
hold “Lofty” Barlow, an ex-A.I.F. mem-
ber who plays off a 6 handicap. He is a
Government dairy expert, and there are
also times when he is apt to regard his
golf in the light of a fair cow. W. M.
Ross, he of the secretive, inscrutable
smile, is a member of the pennant
team on a 7 handicap. He is a com-
pany secretary away from the links. He
• it determined eyebrows who follows
1S -X,i :ave f ’ , P res ident. He is a fair
middle-mark player and bears such a re-
semblance to the King—though Frith
seems to have missed it—that his cronies
habitually address him as “George.”
After his president comes the captain,
r § Thomson, a foundation life
member. Suave and imperturbable as he
appears in the drawing, he is the most
popular of skippers and a mighty worker
f or the club. His handicap (10) has
dropped since the cares of skipperdom
descended upon him, which is in contra-
diction to the usual rule. Outside Koo-
yonga, Bob is in the motor business.
The countenance expressive of something
between delirious joy and agonised appre-
hension is that of Frank Taylor, one of
K.’s staunchest middle-markers. He is
the pleasantest of men, with a weakness
for starting from the 10th tee, the layout
of the course making that exceedingly
convenient to the 19th. He is a merchant
in his working hours,
A. G. Ross, 17 as to handicap, is an-
other of the club’s A.I.F. men, and can
still speak the language fluently if any-
thing goes wrong with his game, as not
infrequently happens. He is the club’s
acknowledged authority on every bunker
and hazard on the course. No. 7
is Alf Garrood, who plays a very useful
game off the 6 mark. He has a curious
predilection for water—that is, while
playing—rarely failing to land his ball in
some at least once during a round,
whether the stuff be in a lake or a cow’s
hoof print. Insurance is his avocation
when golf is not claiming him.
J. S. Kelly is numbered 8. He is an ex-
captain of the club, one of its best per-
formers off the 5 mark, and a member
of the pennant team, of course. Banking
attracts his attention when golfing hours
are over. Next, with the “let ’em all
come” expression, is Cliff Cornell. He
is a much-travelled importer who has
learned to play steady golf in many lands.
Kooyonga especially honors him as
donor of the A.I.F. Cup.
Double figures mark Tim Swanson,
whose sad, sweet smile and ever-fuming
fag are faithfully reproduced by Frith.
His handicap at present is 20, but he is
being regarded with suspicion by the
stipe—or, in golfing speech, the handi-
capper. Archie Jenner, next in order, is
a combination of Beau Brummell, M.
Beaucaire and Lord Chesterfield rolled
into one, his clothing and deportment
being the models on which fellow-
members endeavor to mould themselves.
As golfer, he spends much of his time
on the putting green, and in business he
is an A.M.P. man.
D. W. Goodhart, twelfth of the gal-
lery, is the secretary, and a good one.
He can play capital golf off 9, but spends
most of the time rushing about the coun-
try in his motor-car —be good enough to
note that it is a motor-car and not a
scooter, and is known to his clubmates as
“The Yellow Peril.” Angus W. Thomas,
reclining on a grassy bank, is not one of
the club’s outstanding stylists. Neverthe-
less, he is not to be trifled with as a
golfer, for, in spite of a swing which sug-
gests a youth misspent in woodchopping,
he is handicapped on 8. Mercantile pur-
suits keep him from the links when he
can spare the time.
L. M. Hogan is admittedly not one of
Kooyonga’s best golfers, wherefore we
omit to mention his handicap. All the
same he has a happy knack of winning a
ball or two on Sunday afternoons, gam-
bling on the Sabbath having no terrors
for him. His golf is invariably played
in a pair of snake-proof breeks, and when
not filling these he occupies an armchair
in his solicitor’s office. F. S. Mann is an
Adelaide merchant who has recently
been trying his game on the Japanese.
He plays a lot of week-day golf from
a 12 handicap, and is chairman of the
finance committee.
D. S. Moody, of the Valentino profile,
is an inter-State player and a member of
the club pennant team, while he has
figured in some of the big championships,
He then worked hard to get his handicap
low enough to qualify and was success-
ful. Now, alas! it is back to where it
was.
F. V. Miers, beaming on the wide
world as usual, is a member of the com-
mittee. Handicapped 6, he plays a lot of
very good golf. When not doing that he
pursues insurance. Murray Richardson,
strangely reminiscent of Warwick Arm-
strong when the opposition wickets were
falling, has only one sorrow in life. The
Kooyonga moths chew up his caps as
fast as he buys them, though why they
draw this invidious distinction between
himself and other members no one
knows. He is a builder in everyday life.
“Hoylake”: A recent golfing feat at
Bonnie Doon (N.S.W.), where a player
holed out a 380-yard hole in two, induced
Leslie Gannon, one of the club’s vice-
presidents, to hang a ten-guinea cheque
on the peg for anyone equalling the
trick in the future. As far as the writer
knows, this becomes the only endowed
hole in Australian golf. In England, at
the Royal Ashdown Forest club, in
Sussex, what is called the “Island hole”
carries a fiver for the player who can
get it in one —this only applies, however,
during the Easter, Whitsuntide and
autumn tourneys. America offers
another. At the David Hills club there
is a fiver on offer for anyone doing the
eighth hole in one.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
GENETICS AND LINE-BREEDING.
‘‘ Bah , b Dwyer”: “Harrowby” (B.
33) disagrees with my statement
that something is wrong with breeding
or feeding when heavy culling is needed,
but as he advocates line-breeding, the
chief object of which is to reduce the
need for culling to a minimum, he dis-
counts his opposition somewhat.
Every good breeder tries to produce
uniform stock which will breed as well
as, or better than, its parents. Like
begets like under like conditions, because
the animal body is merely the custodian
of the germ-plasm. Parents can trans-
mit to offspring only those characters
which they in turn inherited from their
parents. In the case of self-fertilising
plants a pure line may be set up which
will yield progeny almost perfectly uni-
form and varying solely according to en-
vironment. Then, there is no chance of
throwbacks due to the recombination
of latent characters, because there is only
one parent. Neither is there any chance
of improvement, which can only be
brought about by crossing with another
strain carrying different characteristics.
In animal breeding, however, the re-
combination and repulsion of factors are
continuous, and the number of factors
carried by an animal which are independ-
ently inherited and transmitted is so
great that the aid of line-breeding is in-
voked to minimise the element of chance,
thus securing uniformity of type and pro-
duction. In expert hands this form of
inbreeding reduces the necessity of cull-
ing to a minimum. Its disadvantage is
that there is a gradual loss of vigor and
there cannot possibly be any improve-
ment, an animal’s ability to transmit type
and productive ability being determined
solely by the potentialities of ancestors.
The practice of using tested sires was
followed by Bakewell, who hired out his
Leicester rams to neighbors for their first
season and thereafter himself used those
whose progeny measured up to his stan-
dard. There are expert breeders who, like
“Harrowby,” can foresee, with an accu-
racy which seems almost uncanny to the
novice, how the progeny from certain
matings are going to turn out. But the
vast majority can’t, though many think
they can.
CULLING SCIENCE.
“Hatter”: I agree with “Harrowby”
that rigid culling is necessary to fix a
breed true to type, particularly in the case
of a recently-evolved strain, whether of
birds or animals.
Research work among biologists in
recent years sheds some light on the
mystery of heredity, which may be very
briefly and imperfectly summarised as
follows:
The living substance handed from
parent to offspring consists of a series of
tiny units—called genes—lodged within
objects known as chromosomes. The
number of chromosomes is normally the
same for any particular kind of plant or
animal —14 for the sweet-pea, 48 for man,
and so on. Each contains hundreds
of genes, each of which again may con-
tain minor variations. Some genes control
color; others height, weight, fertility,
vigor and so forth. Since a complete issue
is handed on from each parent the
difficulty of breeding true to type may be
readily recognised. For instance, in
guinea-pigs, two varieties of one gene give
a color variation, while two varieties of
another give rough or smooth hair. If
a rough and colored pig is crossed with
a smooth-haired white pig the first crosses
will all be colored and rough, as these
are “dominant” characters ; but if these
crossbreds are mated all possible com-
binations will result. Thus a cross
between two strains with 10 genes differ-
ing instead of two will give over a thou-
sand new combinations, and one differing
in regard to twenty, over a million.
Take the simplest case. If an albino
rabbit is crossed with a colored one, all
the offspring are colored ; but if the cross
is bred back to pure albino the resultant
family will be an equal number of white
and colored, showing that the albino-
producing gene, though recessive, is still
present in the colored varieties. In the
same way, plants or animals may be
carrying “recessive” characters without
showing them, but they are always liable
to reappear in later generations when the
right mating occurs —these are known as
throwbacks.
FAT LAMBS AND WOOL.
“Lion”: Six years’ experimenting
satisfies me that the best paying cross for
fat lambs and wool is a large, plain-
bodied merino ewe and a reliable stud
English Leicester ram.
The progeny which this produces are
solid and compact, suitable for export
and normally fatten easily. They readily
fetch within Is. to 2s. of the more favored
special carcass crosses.
Bad seasons often visit favored dis-
tricts — e.g., last winter —with the result
that one does not get the lambs off as
suckers if in big numbers, and they have
to be shorn. With our Leicester-merino
cross, the wool is in great demand and
fetches as good a price as top merino
fleeces. With the latest special cross for
fat lambs (export only) this is not the
case, and so the breeder is hit up
on his lamb’s wool and doesn’t get his
lamb off as a special export sucker.
Our own figures for this year will illus-
trate my point:
Top line AAAA E merino, 21£d.; top
line CCC H crossbred hoggets, 21|d. —
equal in value. Top line AAA crossbred,
18d.
Since we sold there have been three
further rises in wool, so the quality of
the crossbred wool speaks for itself.
One factor concerning this particular
cross needs careful consideration, i.e.,
they must be fattened quickly and never
allowed to go back. If they do go back
then the lambs go to wool and will sel-
dom fatten again until shorn.
Keeping them moving is not as hard
as one might think, and given a normal
season and good pastures they can be
easily fattened without any anxiety re-
garding the wool. If you wish to keep
the progeny, the ewe carries a highly
saleable class of wool, grows to a large
size and breeds an excellent lamb either
to merino or crossbred rams.
We have tried other crosses —among
them the merino-Romney, which, though
good for wool, doesn’t breed as nice a
shaped carcass as the other.
QUEENSLAND FAT LAMBS.
“Barrabooriong”: Minister Bulcock
has been rediscovering the Darling Downs
as a field for raising export lambs. Sun-
ners, chairman of the Meat Industry
Board, is backing him, and 500,000 car-
casses per annum is the objective. To this
end Leicesters, Romneys, Shrops., Dorset
Horns and the like are to be introduced
as examples to the local breeder.
As a matter of fact, the experiment was
tried on the Downs 30 years ago, and in
a few isolated cases it has survived down
the years. Here and there, men who
know the job have made more or less of
a success of it—mostly less—but they
have never produced a lamb of the stand-
ard of best, or even medium, Victorian or
Canterbury. That failure is due to three
main difficulties, which, so far, have not
been overcome.
Firstly, the Downs pastures, long eaten
out and sheep-sick, are notoriously
wormy—a very real problem for the
lamb producer.
Secondly, the Darling Downs lamb —
produced in the temperate regions of
Southern Queensland on good pastures —
dies with a wrong proportion of. fat to
meat.
Thirdly, to produce lambs economic-
ally for export, 1000 acres of land is
needed with (inclusive) a hundred or so
acres of lucerne. Thousand-acre holdings
on the Darling Downs in the right centres
for lamb production are hard to get, and
harder still to hold.
Fourthly—and its importance needs no
enlarging—Cunningham’s Garden of
Eden is notoriously undependable in rain-
fall. Mr. Bulcock should try some other
district.
ADVANTAGES OF CLASSING.
“Dal”: In defence of the obvious, may
I tabulate the advantages of employing
a competent woolclasser? The presence
of a class breeds confidence in the buyer.
He knows that the bulk of the Australian
clip is well prepared and is usually satis-
fied when he knows that a competent
classer is employed, if only a proportion
of each lot is shown on the sale floor. In
South Africa, where little or no effort is
made to class the wool, every bale has to
be shown.
The classing of small clips is much
harder than that of bigger ones, as the
classer has to decide how to prepare them
to the best advantage with a minimum of
lines. Owners of small flocks, in many
cases, employ a relation or friend—some-
one, in fact, who has absolutely no claim
to call himself a woolclasser —and in such
manner classing has got into bad repute.
Wool-classing cannot be learnt in five
minutes, but requires years of practical
experience among wool of all types, and
the sooner this point is realised the less
criticism will be received from foreign
consumers. Classing does not consist in
preparing the wool by its color, say
bright, dingy and short. This conception,
to quote a colloquialism, “went out with
the blades.”
ALL-IN METHOD NOT FAVORED.
“Mouton”: “A.8.C.” (B. 20/12/’33)
makes astounding statements when he
says that woolbuyers do not know wool
when they see it and handle it, although in
most instances they have had many years
of factory and technical training. I
venture to say they know wool as few
growers can hope to do.
The all-in method must result in loss
to the grower, and is fundamentally
opposed to all the economic laws of
marketing.
I have been closely associated with the
wool industry for 36 years, and I could
cite hundreds of cases where farmers have
lost pence per pound through faulty
grading. Further, I have investigated
scores of cases where farmers have
claimed that they get more by adopting
the all-in method, and I have yet to find
a case that will stand investigation.
“A.8.C.” is not doing himself justice or
the industry any good by recommending
disorderly marketing.
“Woolaway” (same issue) hits the
nail right on the head when he says the
small grower must learn that the main
factors which make for successful mar-
keting are evenness in type, quality
and condition. Writers such as “Wool-
away,” “Trepex” and “Murrawong” will
receive the support of all experienced
.wool men, as their ideas are sound and
correct. And “A.8.C.” will do well to
follow their lead.
WHAT IS A SCRUB BULL?
“Curlew”: “Observer” (B. 13/12/’33)
says “the time is ripe for stringent laws
relating to the breeding of dairy herds
from scrub bulls.” Just so. But what is
a “scrub bull”? One without a pedigree?
No. A pedigree is only a merit indicator ;
some people mistake it for a merit.
The Ayrshires are particularly a dairy
breed. On looks they are second to none.
But breeders have gone for show points
and in Victoria, the home of the Aus-
tralian Ayrshire, results are obvious. Of
136 pure-bred Ayrshires which completed
lactation periods during the September
quarter only 62 got certificates. Cer-
tainly a number did not complete their
full 273 days. Perhaps their owners
poleaxed them. It isn’t always length of
pedigree but ancestral quality that counts.
Years back, long before herd-testing
came into vogue, I knew seasoned dairy-
men who had wonderful dairy herds —
for milk. Butter-fat was not looked for
in those days, the Babcock not having
been born, so milk was the standard set.
And they could milk. Those dairymen
used non-registered bulls. But they were
bulls saved from their best cows, and they
bred milkers.
If the bull business is to be regulated,
let it be an offence to save a bull calf
from any cow of the dairy breeds that does
not come up to the butter-fat standard
set: Junior two-year-olds, 2301 b. butter-
fat for 273 days ; senior two-year-olds,
2501 b.; junior three-year-olds, 2701b.'
senior three-year-olds, 2901 b. ; junior
four-year-olds, 3101 b.; senior four-year-
olds, 3301 b. ; mature cows, 3501 b. Away
with the scrub bull, but let us include
the pedigree scrubs with the rest.
THE ABERDEEN-ANGUS REVIVAL.
“Beefo”: Pastoralists in n.-w. Queens-
land are taking the right track in an
endeavor to produce cattle fit for the
chilled trade. Several bulls are on the
way from England, and further purchases
have been made. Ninety per cent, of the
stock to be imported is Aberdeen-Angus.
The recent carcass championship at the
Smithfield cattle show gave a favorable
result to the breed. An Aberdeen-Angus
carcass was placed first; another tied with
a Shorthorn for second place. An Aber-
deen-Angus also won the on-the-hoof
championship.
Smithfield experts have time and again
impressed upon Dominion meat ex-
porters the necessity for providing the
“baby” beef demanded by the trade to
meet the requirements of British house-
wives. They have gone further, in fact,
and have announced that to attain the
desired results the introduction of the
Aberdeen-Angus into Australian herds is
essential.
The A.-A. has proved ideal for cross-
ing with the Shorthorn, and, with prac-
tically all the big herds of north-west
Queensland running the latter breed, the
foundation of quality beef will be firmly
established with the introduction of more
A.-A. bulls.
BRIGALOW GRASS.
“Outback”: A pasture-improving grass
that is receiving attention in Queensland
is the brigalow, so named because it is
mostly found in brigalow country. It is
suited for “bad” districts, due to its
deep-rooting system, and does not grow
too high to become hard and rank or a
fire menace. The original habit is to
form a clump, but the seed-heads fall out-
wards and bear the seed to the ground,
acting as a protective covering for the
new plants, which gradually grow into the
parent clump, making a close and dense
pasture. In brigalow’s self-seeding it re-
sembles sub. clover, which acts on
the same principle and pushes its seed-
pod into the soil before the seed-bearing
stem dies off the parent plant. A rested
pasture of brigalow grass in seed
time would soon ensure a good feeding
area, while the original seed outlay is

small, due to its copious spread. It will
crush out lesser-valued native grasses, and,
as it is a good fattener, this service is an
added asset. Brigalow is still in its trial
stages and needs close attention for a
while. It gives fodder both in winter and
summer, the stock relishing it when either
dry or green.
WEEDS AND GRASSES.
“Hatter”: I heartily agree with “U.
Murray” (B. 27/12/*33) that it is a crime
to grow poor grasses where good ones
will thrive. In the same way it is a
crime to grow sub. clover on land suited
to wild white clover. My remarks, how-
ever, referred only to areas of acid waste
lands which might be turned to account
by encouraging sweet vernal and fog.
These I grant are weeds, but there are
worse weeds and they may prove of value
under certain conditions. For instance,
fog in some climates is quite useful for
winter grazing.
While it is a fact that all herbage up
to the height of four inches or so has
practically the same feeding value, it is
not easy in practical farming to keep
rank grasses grazed to this level, and the
tendency is for them to run away and
seed to the detriment of good pasture.
Liming and manuring help to keep both
fog and sweet vernal in check.
MANURING THE MANGOLD.
“Tumbe Munda”: This year I sowed in
parallel strips Yellow Globe mangolds
and Half Sugar mangolds. The manur-
ing was: At one end, two inches depth
of stable manure; in the middle, just
enough fowl manure to color the ground ;
at the other end, about 3cwt. to the acre
of super. There was a distinct difference
in the germination of the two varieties.
Half Sugar gave a plant yield 50 p.c.
greater than Yellow Globe. Germina-
tions in the stable-manure and super,
plots were about even. In the fowl-manure
plot it was slacker in Half Sugar, bad ; n
Yellow Globe. However, actual yields
promise to reverse this order. At present
on the super, plot there are few plants
with butts measuring two inches across,
while the stable- and fowl-manure plots
have mostly three- and up to four-inch
butts, with a decidedly better all-round
growth on the fowl-manure plot.
Seeds with faulty germinating powers
are harmed by contact with fowl manure,
but in comparison with weight of dressing
this manure will give a decidedly better
yield of roots than will the other manures
fried.
GRASSHOPPER PLAGUES.
“Mulgo”: Grasshoppers in the early
’hopper stage can be checked in several
ways without the use of poisons. Once
they get on the wing they are difficult
to deal with. When they are approaching
cultivated crops, the best way to stop
them is to fire the grass. The pest, in
plague dimensions, will otherwise devour
it and pass on. If the grass is too green
to burn, drive a mob of sheep, kept as
close together as possible, to and fro over
the affected area. This plan has been
found very effective with caterpillars.
Another method is to run wide wooden
rollers over the infested grass; but this
has to be kept continually going.
The best time to operate is between
sundown and a little after sunrise. The
’hoppers stop about sunset, and do not
start to move again till the dew is off
the grass. During this interval it is not
necessary to go twice over the same
ground, as is often the case in daytime
while the hordes are rapidly advancing.
Another thing, at this time they are not
actively hopping away when disturbed,
and thus very few escape. A wet day,
which hampers their progress, is also a
good time to deal with them.
In Syria and Mespot. long, deep
trenches are ploughed as a check. This
is only advisable to save crops when
other means are unavailable.
If ibises are about in sufficient numbers
—and a flock generally appears soon after
a plague occurs, whether of grasshoppers
or caterpillars—leave the birds to deal
with them, unless the advance is too near
to crops. Then a trench is useful.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Bushie”: My experience with leather
pump buckets may be handy. Never
take a knife to them, but see you have
an ample supply of all sizes required
well soaked in a billycan of neatsfoot oil.
These do not swell as when soaked in
water, and will work freely in cylinder
and with no back pressure on the mill.
If manufacturers would only make them
a fraction smaller than the stipulated
size, they would earn the gratitude of all
users.
“Karaway”: Corn husks, chaffed and
mixed with weakened molasses, make
good feed for cows in bad times. The
husks can be stacked like hay, but keep
the top covered.
“W.P.T.”: To make a bag covering
waterproof, mix equal parts of raw and
boiled linseed oil and add lib. vegetable
black- to every 51b. of oil. Apply two
coats to each side of the bag covering,
using a good stiff brush. The finished
article will be as good as a tarpaulin.
“Silen”: Tobacco dust at 3d. a pound
is the cheapest dusting medium for leaf-
eating insects and seed-beds. Likewise
it’s a worm-chaser if added to the chooks’
mash or the fodder issue of any stock.
The nicotine content is enough to kill
the worm larvae internally, but not enough
to cause poisoning.
“D.J.H.”: “Mundowie” (B. 3/l/’34) in
describing the beetle hunt in the cane-
fields should not overlook the humble
chook. A good few growers have port-
able houses, and the fowls wallop the
cane grubs, waxing fat on the diet. A
pen of “store” chooks is soon market
fats. Incidentally, would not the insect-
suction plan mentioned in M.O.L. (B.
3/1 / ’34) be a godsend on the canefields?
“Gumblegubbin”: It is always better
to put in separate posts for a gate, par-
ticularly in a wire fence. If the wire is
strained from a gate post, fence or gate
soon gets out of order.
“Bill R.”: To make an automatic
drinking fountain empty a petrol- or
kerosene-tin through a half-inch hole
made centrally in one side, an inch from
the bottom. Cut a kippered-herring or
similar tin longitudinally in halves. Beat
a quarter-inch flange outwards around the
inner rim. Solder it to the petrol-tin so
as to form a cup beneath the aperture.
Submerge the apparatus till filled with
water, then stand it in a handy place for
the fowls. When stood upright the cup
will fill without overflowing.
“T.P.K.-N.”: Agree with “Aerogenes”
(B. 27/12/’33) that dragging heifers to
the bail with a winch is unduly drastic.
My experience is that tying the calf at
the head of the bail is an effective means
of decoying most heifers bailwards.
“J.R.M.”: Re destruction of sweet-
briar scrub (B. 13/12/’33). Years ago I
had to clear an alluvial flat on which
there were many clumps of briar, some
20 feet in diameter. The ground being
soft, a long chain and a team of bullocks
got over any trouble. The chain was taken
right round the clump, and the team
hitched on. “Whoa, Baldy! Come here,
Spot!” and out came the bunch. When
the root earth dries it can be knocked off
with a piece of sapling and the rest
burned.
“Valerin”: An anomaly of this year’s
wool sales is the prices of lower lines
of well-prepared clips compared with
top lines. Often inferior wools beat the
higher grades. This is also noticeable in
sales of farmers’ lots compared with
well-bred and carefully-classed station
clips. I live in wheat-growing Riverina,
and it is not uncommon to find non-
descript types of wool, dusty and badly-
classed, bringing as much as big clips of
“classy” wool. What is the explanation?
“Beefo”: Maoriland is taking the
export-beef question seriously, and after
almost a ten-year discussion legislation is
to be introduced to make dehorning com-
pulsory. Queensland might with advan-
tage follow suit. In Canada a premium
is given for hornless beef cattle, and 80
p.c. of the cattle in U.S.A. are polled.
Australia must fall in line if Smithfield
is to give our beef the attention it should
have.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
1 have an orange-tree four years old which,
for sentimental reasons, I wish to retain. There
is a very good seedless orange near by.
Proper time and method or methods of graft-
ing or budding the one on the other? —9557.
If in a frosty district, bud the orange-tree with
buds from the seedless orange in the coming
autumn, allowing the bud to remain dormant
until the next spring, and then forcing it into
growth by the removal of the top of the budded
tree. If, however, in a frostless area, the bud-
ding could be executed immediately, provided
the tree to be budded and the tree from
which the buds are to be obtained are both
growing actively. This can be easily tested
by cutting a slit in the bark and endeavoring
to raise the bark from the wood. If it sepa-
rates readily, the tree can be budded; if not,
apply nitrogenous manure and water, and
shortly after growth commences try again. It
would be advisable to bud into the branches
of the four-year-old tree rather than into the
trunk. Four buds, placed symmetrically
around the tree, should be ample. Pamphlet,
“Budding Citrus Trees,” has been posted.
Has Westralia a statute providing relief for
farmers ? If so, what are its main provisions ?
—9580.
The Farmers’ Debts Adjustment Act, opera-
tive to March 31 next, provides that any farmer
or creditor of his may apply to a director
appointed under the Act ,to call a meeting of
the farmer’s creditors. A chairman is appointed,
and it is his duty to invite the creditors to
consult and ascertain whether it is not possible
“to arrange the affairs of the farmer to advan-
tage” and pass any resolution to that effect they
may deem to be expedient. A receiver is
appointed, and the farmer is prohibited, during
the receivership,/from in any way dealing with
his property, and the owner of any machinery
in the possession of the farmer under a hire-
purchase agreement is prohibited from taking
action for recovery of the debt or of the
machinery.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
The Film Business
It is hard to discern what prompted the
Stevens Government in appointing an
accountant to go into the rights and
wrongs of “the film war.” So far Mr.
Marks’s inquiry has brought forth noth-
ing that goes very deep. The evidence
(or propaganda) mainly revolves round
the proposed building of new theatres by
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and a concern for
which a Mr. Martin speaks, somewhat
stridently ; but unless more definite and
energetic efforts are made to get a true
picture from behind the scenes the public
is likely to be left as much in the dark
as ever.
Without a thorough investigation of
the ramifications, it is about as easy to
distinguish a snake’s body from its tail
as it is to define what are Australian and
what are American interests in the pic-
ture business. What is known as “the
combine” is a maze of interlocking cos.
that shouts for company-law reform.
To begin with, who owns the General
Theatres Corp.? Legally speaking,
Union Theatres and Hoyts may own it.
But who owns U.T. and Hoyts? And
to what extent does the Fox Film Corp.
control General Theatres’ exhibiting
policy?
In 1931 Fox Films, of U.S.A., bought
the whole of the ords. and most of the C
prefs. in Hoyts. Then Fox also ad-
vanced £ 170,000-odd on a second deben-
ture to help Hoyts in its lavish building
programme in competition with U.T. The
Fox Co. thus held the whip-hand when
both concerns merged the business of
their city houses under the name of
General Theatres Corp. ; Fox Films gave
its approval subject to Hoyts, U.T. and
General Theatres entering into a five-
year agreement to show Fox pictures at
substantially 1931-32 prices. Metro-
Goldwyn’s representative at the inquiry
stated that his concern had not
approached General Theatres to sell its
1934 films, as it “sensed” they would not
be accepted.
Hoyts Theatres, Ltd., originally amal-
gamated the picture interests of Hoyts
and J. C. Williamson, Ltd., in 1926. The
U.T. group amalgamated the interests of
four or five separate exhibitors away back
in 1912. Men buy shares on ’Change in
Hoyts, Wests, Spencers, etc., but precious
little knowledge of the affairs of the
operating concerns is vouchsafed to them.
In 1920, E. J. and Dan Carroll and
Harry Musgrove started building the
Prince Edward Theatre in Sydney. Car-
roll Musgrove Theatres (the co. they
floated) was not then in “the combine” ;
the total cost of the theatre property
was less than £200,000. This has been
one of the most attractive and successful
theatres in the city. On the other hand,
the State, built by U.T. Investments, Ltd.,
and which with its shopping block cost
over £1,000,000, has not in any year
(up to Dec., 1932) earned enough to pay
its preference dividend.
The Sydney theatre which Metro-
Goldwyn proposes to erect is estimated to
cost £200,000. If it wants to build
theatres and is prepared to put up the
money, let it; and that goes for any
party to the “war.” In the parlous con-
dition of the trade the public will not
tolerate any Government embargo on
building to please any particular group
or faction.
Idle Men and Idle Money
“King D.”: Why aren’t they working
together (B. 10/1 / ’34)? It is the great
problem of the world to-day. Roosevelt
proposes to solve it in his country by bor-
rowing and spending $10,000,000,000.
It may work if the Roosevelt millions
are used in the best possible way to
create a fusion between unemployed capi-
tal and unemployed labor. But Austra-
lian experience is that borrowing for “re-
productive public works” has given a
minimum of stimulus to the circulation of
money. Once the capital has been spent
in raw materials and labor, it ceases to
give much employment and begins to fur-
nish deficits which handicap private em-
ployers.
The investor is the one to start the
ball of re-employment rolling. Before
the unemployed can represent a demand
for more than what their dole-tickets
allow them, they must be given the
wherewithal to buy, which can only be
derived from jobs. The investor will have
to trust that, by the time the new capital
“ e J^ s P ro yided has started to produce,
Sufficient stimulus will have been given
to the circulation of money, by his own
initial effort and the efforts of others, to
create a profitable demand for whatever
it is he is selling. He must be willing to
take risks. He will need to investigate
market and trade possibilities. It will
be through the medium of a joint stock
co. that he will probably play his part.
One obstacle is heavy taxation. The
thought of. it chills him.
Can the Government fruitfully play the
part of investor? It has many things in
its favor. At present it can borrow
cheaply, and its borrowings are not re-
payable on demand or after short periods.
It can do something that the banks
cannot legitimately do: finance new
private industrial undertakings. The
banks might do that form of business
through the security of an underwriting
house, but, generally speaking, they look
upon it as being outside their sphere.
Geelong has a Returned Soldiers’
Woollen Co., which was founded by the
late Brigadier-General Bob Smith in
1920. Its share-capital was inadequate.
It was granted a Commonwealth loan
of £50,000, later increased to £60,000, at
6 p.c. At last balance-day this co.’s total
debt was only £36,000. It has been one
“I bet it voz, too.”
of the most successful woollen mills in
Australia, earning 10.7 p.c. on its capital
last term. Surely the policy which has
yielded such good results in this case
could be usefully extended.
For many years N. S. Wales textile
mills have had to pay higher wages for
shorter hours than Vic. concerns. Amal-
gamated Textiles (Aust.), Ltd., which
operates woollen mills at Orange, Goul-
burn and Albury, was a case in
point; it had a very rough spin
from various causes, and it was only after
a ten-year wait and the loss of a third of
their capital that shareholders received
their first div. (5 p.c.) last year. In the
middle of December the textile workers
throughout Australia (excepting Queens-
land) were brought under a uniform
Federal award, and that meant a cut in
N.S.W. wages, in the case of many male
operators, from about £3 16s. to £3 Bs. a
week of 44 hours. That’s what the strike
at Orange and Goulburn is about—so far
Amalgamated’s Albury mill is unaffected.
The £3 Bs. a week may not be a high wage,
but until Amalgamated’s mills are on a
stronger financial basis than at present it
is no time for striking. It only requires
a drop in the tariff or the exchange to
bring a flood of overseas competition into
the country again, and that might mean
no jobs at all for the employees.

“Lewlo” lets himself go:
H. P. Brown, C.8.E., demanded Is. to con-
vey a lib. parcel from Brisbane to Tweed
Heads (70 miles). He only wanted Bd. to
take the same parcel to Samoa, or 9d. to take
it to Durban or Cape Town. At the other
extreme, Mr. Brown wants 7s. 3d. to carry an
1 lib. parcel to Melbourne from Brisbane, but
he will take the same 111 b. to France for 4s.
9d., or to North Borneo for ss. 2d. The same
parcel sent to Tweed Heads (still 70 miles) will
cost me 55., but 4s. 2d. is sufficient to land
it in New Caledonia. Overseas shipping cos.
should really employ Mr. Brown to fix their
passenger rates. He would charge £lO from
Brisbane to Melbourne and £8 10s. 6d. from
Brisbane to Marseilles. Mexico would be six-
pence extra. Just in case it sounds stupid, the
parcel which costs 7s. 3d. from Brisbane to
Melbourne would be landed in Mexico for 6s.
6d., in Hayti for 6s. Id., in Morocco for ss.
10d., in Britain for 6s. 4d., in Germany for
ss. sd. and in France for 4s. 9d. Yes, it’s
a wonderful post office!

“L.A.T.”: The Bulletin was one of the
first to sponsor the use of low-grade wool
in quilt- and mattress-making. Certain
trade difficulties were overcome and its
use is now fairly general, though the
carbonised wool had a tendency to mat
when used as a filling. The authorities
were also urged to protect the grower by
insisting that woollen goods, particularly
quilt- and mattress-fillings, should be
branded strictly according to materials.
Now, after seven months, the Government
has issued regulations calling upon manu-
facturers to declare the percentage of each
material used as a filling in the article.
Henceforth the woolgrower should find
an additional market for his low-grade
wool, some of which, during the 1930-
1932 seasons, would not meet transport
costs.

“Wild Kitty”: Whenever I breast the
rail of one of the milk bars in Martin-
place I think of the late Dr. Arthur, and
picture the satisfaction which the old
man would show could he see the throng
of milk-drinkers calling for chocolate-
and strawberry-malteds. It’s the four-
penny glass that has done it. Two or
three years ago a malted-milk invariably
cost ninepence ; to-day the bars which do
a quick turnover —and appear to be coin-
ing money—charge only fourpence, and
I’ll guarantee three times as much milk
is being drunk between eleven and two
o’clock by office-workers. It’s a pity
something similar can’t be done to market
real fruit-juice drinks. Citrus orchardists
would benefit, as well as the public ; I
for one am tired of the artificially-colored
and -flavored “fruit drinks” that come
out of bottles.
“Held Over”: Queensland has just
introduced a Life-assurance Act that,
amongst other things, requires life offices
to pay certain surrender values, where
demanded, under industrial-assurance
policies. It is a provision that should be
extended to every State. Indeed,
life assurance (particularly industrial
assurance), as it often represents a thrifty
person’s last line of defence, should be
covered by a very tight Commonwealth
Act.

“Vic”: The habit which has grown up
in the Dominions of sending cases of
jam, carcasses of lamb, refrigerated scrub
turkeys and tinned pineapple to the King
has become widespread enough to assure
that Buckingham Palace will never starve.
But if the donors believe that the King
eats all the jam and tomatoes which
come his way they are gravely mistaken
—a very large proportion goes to persons
on the royal charity lists. Again, if
they think they are promoting the sale of
Australian goods in Britain, they don’t
understand the mother country’s psy-
chology. If H.M. were to say “This is
jolly good jam!” or “Australian lamb
does me!” loyal subjects by the dozen
would “follow the King” and buy the
Australian product—if. they could get it
to buy, which, mostly, they can’t. But
nothing is ever said except “Thanks very
much,” and that butters no parsnips in
England, especially as the thanks have to
be so numerous and vicarious that it
needs a form letter to deal with them,

“Mungri”: One of Archdale Parkhill’s
jobs When he drops in on Egypt during
his trade inquiry tour, which could have
been conducted as efficiently and more
cheaply by a clerk, will be to find out
why Egypt’s trade with Australia dropped
from £3,911,381 in 1928-29 to £1,049,360
in 1931-32. Flour, wheat and, latterly,
butter were the principal Gyppo imports.
In return we took from them goods worth
£38,845 in 1928-29, and £15,751 in
1931-32, mostly raw cotton, gums and
pitch. Even Gyppos grow tired of buying
'much and selling little.

“50’s”: “In the woollen textiles
trade and that of garments where wool
is used the situation arising from the
advance in the raw material is bemg
closely watched,” says the financial
column of the Brisbane “Courier-Mail.”
If I have to pay more than sixpence extra
for a woollen singlet I shall be annoyed,
though I would cheerfully give it if I
thought the grower would benefit. Cost
of the raw material is one of the minor
items in finely-woven textiles, though in
rugs and heavy woollens it is another
matter. I doubt whether I wear more
than two or three pounds of wool at
any time.

The Mosgiel Woollen Co., of Dunedin,
has just celebrated its diamond jubilee, and
John Roberts is being congratulated on
his sixty years in the chair. The co. has
built up its business on the excellence of
its products ; that this has been a good
policy is illustrated by distributions to
shareholders, which averaged 7.9 p.c. for
the first 30 years and 8.5 p.c. over the
last.

“Rego”: I read that an R.A.A.F. flight-
lieut. has returned from abroad in a sub-
sidised U.S.A. steamer. It must be en-
couraging to American shipping interests
to have their line patronised by servants
of the Commonwealth Government,
which is going to do such ferocious things
to them. 5

“Cotter”: Australia imported 11,500-
odd motor-cars, valued at more than a
million, in 1932-33—about three times as
many as during the previous year. This
is further evidence that, even if the de-
pression has not entirely lifted, many of
us are willing to believe the worst is over.
In 1931-32 we bought 4406 unassembled
chassis from U.K. and U.S.A., valued at
£332,107 ; for the 1932-33 financial year
imports rose to 11,516, valued at
£1,008,837. In the four months July-
October the increase was well main-
tained : £323,237 worth of chassis entered
the Commonwealth, indicating that this
year’s purchases will show another 50
p.c. increase ; buyers tend to stand off
the market until the new year’s models
arrive. Uncle Sam is finding British com-
petition rather too warm for him. By
1931 U.S.A. was selling us £184,000
worth of cars compared with Britain’s
£228,000. Next year its share of this
trade was £336,000, with Britain again
well on top with £643,000 —and not all
“baby” cars at that.

N.G. Discoveries
“Kaloa”: The reference (B. 13/12/’33)
to the discovery of a new tract of upland
country m New Guinea where the natives
practise advanced agriculture needs
elaboration. The photographs brought
by Taylor and the Leahys show
rlu P e °Pl e rese mble their neighbors
of the Markham closely, but that their
habits are far different. They do not
chew the betel-nut, and their white teeth
are a feature which distinguishes them
from all other M.T. natives. Their
nelds are shown as neatly divided as
Chinese gardens; their huts are equal
in thatching to Saxon rural homes at the
time of the Conquest ; their ceremonies
c . aj T led out on lawns shaded by
aitmcially planted trees laid out geometri-
cally. The country when first seen
seemed illimitable with an endless, tortuous

are a well-built race, one tribe at least living
on their own farms, instead of in villages, and
cultivating corn, sweet potatoes, sugar and
cucumbers.
The Germans knew something of this
country, but they kept it very quiet. It
is apparently the best
tract discovered as yet
in New Guinea, and
t h e Commonwealth
Government should
take instant steps to see
that it is reserved to the
natives and that they
do not suffer the influx
of the missionary, the

A Good
Appointment
“FY7”: “Spare
Slop’s” prediction that
Queensland’s Police
Commissioner would be
appointed from the
rank and file (B.
27/12/’33) has come a
thud. The pea picked is
C. J. Carroll, chief in-
spector of the Taxa-
tion Department, and
acknowledged by all
and sundry as one of
the most capable men
in the Queensland civil
service. He joined the
Taxation Department
in 1918 —he had been a
school-teacher before
the war—and his career
has been one of consistent progress. He
recently inquired about secret commis-
sions in the dairying industry, and his
findings raised blisters • on the paper.
Carroll, though not a policeman, was
not far removed from the ranks of the
Men in Blue. His father is Inspector
Carroll, now retired, and he was born in
the police station at Blackall, on the
Barcoo, in 1888. He began working life
as a pupil teacher in Blackall, and was
in Brisbane when he enlisted with the
9th Battalion in 1915. Promotion to
captain, two wounds and a Military Cross
came in due course, and after being in-
valided home he was demobbed in 1918,
when he joined up with the income-tax
staff. For a time he was lent to the
military folk to clean up finances at
Townsville, coming back to the I.T. in
1920.
The . Commissioner-to-be- —who will
take over in May—has all the qualities
to command success in his new job. His
advent points to the strengthening and
consolidation of a force which has always
been a good one, but has of late years
been too eager to bargain with the poli-
ticians.
'‘Brian J.”: Spencer Browne, who re-
tires from the Brisbane “Courier-Mail,”
is, no doubt, most of the things “El V.”
says he is (B. 3/1 / ’34), but he certainly
is a “seventh-generation Australian.”
Checking dates from the par. in question
h is apparent that Mr. Spencer Browne
>va s born in 1859, and seven generations
can’t be fitted in between 1788 and 1859.
He may be fourth-generation, but even
‘ is is doubtful. It would be interesting
to know what is the greatest number of
Australian generations extant. My own
youngsters are sixth-generation, and I
have never met any seventh, although
there probably are some, and it is just
possible there may be eighth. I can’t
believe they go any higher than that.
* * * *
“Enoggera”: There is a row in Bris-
bane over the Government buildings to
be erected in Anzac Square, on which
£400,000 is to be spent within the
next few years. The Lord Mayor and
the Town Planning Association oppose
the building of shop-display windows for
the Tourist Bureau, and awnings on the
side which fronts the Memorial Square,
the Lord Mayor remarking that it “would
be humiliating if the buildings did not
harmonise with the central feature of the
square.” There are other objections.
Queensland already has overpowering
blocks of Government buildings scat-
tered between North Quay and Parlia-
ment House, and the new ones will be
isolated from them by half a city. Still,
there are plenty of pubs en route.
* * * *
“Frigid”: So Dalby claims to be the
first place in Bananaland to have a
woman J.P. on the Bench (B. 10/1/’34).
Well, back in 1918, Matilda Hennessy
sat alone in the Esk court. She was a
J.P. by virtue of her office of Clerk of
Petty Sessions, and was the first woman
in the State to be appointed to the com-
“I’ll get this cork out if I have to push it in.”
mission of the peace. She resigned when
she married —she is now Mrs. M.
McGrath. There are more than 200
women Js.P. in Queensland, but I think
Matron Nutt is the only one who sat on
the Bench for a short while with F.
Burne, P.M., a few years ago. Another
distinction is held by Mrs. K. McGill,
wife of the editor of the Newcastle
(N.S.W.) “Herald.” As Miss E. Short,
daughter of a former C.P., she was
appointed acting-registrar of births, mar-
riages and deaths at Maryborough (Q .),
and is the only woman who has con-
ducted a marriage ceremony in this State.
* * * *
“Vic”: The story of the two Cork
prisoners who were forgotten by the
police during a trial and had to find their
own way to gaol reminds me that such
things have happened more than once in
Australia. Many years ago when cars
were not so common, a Queensland con-
stable, conveying a prisoner about 300
miles for trial, put his charge on the load
behind him and settled down at the wheel
to dream of his lady-love. As lunch-
time approached, he suddenly felt soci-
able and, turning to speak to his prisoner,
discovered that he was not there. Full
of bitter thoughts about the untrust-
worthiness of human nature, the m.c.
turned the car and 20 miles back dis-
covered an anguished malefactor stag-
gering along his wheel-tracks and using
back-of-Boulia language about the flam-
ing absentmindedness of people who
could let a cove fall off a car in a sand
creek without hearing the thud or the
consequent yell.
The Darwin correspondent of the
“N.Q. Register” explodes a flapper-press
furphy:
Superintendent Stretton greatly deprecates the
sensational reports published in the southern
metropolitan press concerning the mission at
Groote Eylandt being in a state of siege or
having been 50.... The “electric alarms” in-
stalled are bullock bells hung on a barbed-wire
entanglement, through some thick scrub inter-
vening between the police camp and the mission
station buildings which the police party did not
think it essential to cut down and clear away.
* * * *
“Wau”: Cocoa is proving a good
friend to some New Britain planters who
are suffering from the copra slump. In
the German time a number of planta-
tions in the Baining and on Vitu and
elsewhere tried it with fair success, and
would have expanded their plantings if it
had not been for the war. There are now
750 acres bearing and more than twice as
much under trees. The Commonwealth
gives a bounty of £ll per ton on the
crop, which has been realising £37 per
ton in the open Sydney market. It
seems to be an industry well worth a bit
of nursing.
* * * *
“Barang”: Touching “Mundowie” (B.
3/1 / ’34) on beetle-catching in the cane-
fields, has Australia ever experimented
with the parasite which deals with the
pest in Hawaii? As early as 1906
Frederick Muir, a Cambridge entomo-
logist began searching for a cane-beetle
spiflicator. He discovered the tachinid
fly, which lives on the beetle. The
Government gave Muir permission to
land the parasites in Queensland, and
he established a breeding station at
Mossman (N.Q.) and one in Fiji. In re-
lays he was able to get a good supply into
Honolulu; impressive results were ob-
tained immediately. At present Muir
lives in the South of England and re-
ceives a substantial pension from the
Hawaiian Government.
* * * *
“Anopheles”: Brisbane is about the
only city of its size in the world which
appears compelled to confess itself de-
feated by the mosquito. A few years
ago a census of patients at General Hos-
pital showed so much filaria infection that
the medical profession sat up and took
notice. In Panama, once a veritable death-
trap, and in Rabaul, where the land is
more swampy than anywhere round Bris-
bane, and where mangroves and other
harborside vegetation and perpetual damp
and wetness make ideal mosquito
conditions, the worst of the pest
has been cleared out. But in Brisbane,
as Dr. T. A. Price, president-elect
of the 8.M.A., remarks, the cam-
paign is almost abandoned. Votes, of
course, are the reason, though the doctor
does not say so. A campaign requires a
firm hand and minute supervision for a
little while by local authorities, which have
learnt from long experience that they get
on much better with happy-go-lucky rate-
payers if they confine themselves to such
activities as building concrete roads and
putting down lavish lengths of footpath.
General health must be suffering through
the neglect. Filaria is not a thing to play
with, even though Brisbane only knows
its milder forms. In its more acute
condition, often seen in the Pacific-, it
spells elephantiasis.
“Australia Jane's” Budget
This week’s English mail brings news of
the marriage of Stella Macartney (otherwise
Christabel Evelyn Marie), daughter of the late
W. S. Macartney, of Rockwood (N.Q.). For
some years Stella and her mother have made
their home at Glenmanus House, Portrush,
Northern Ireland. It was from Ulster that the
clan Macartney—the head of the family was
created a baronet about 130 years ago—came
to Queensland. The present holder of the
title, Sir William Isaac of that ilk, and a goodly
number of brothers, cousins and uncles have
spread themselves over the North. Joli-
mont, Mackay, N.Q., is a good address —even
for a fourth baronet.
Edward Macartney, lately Agent-General,
secured another title for the family a few years
ago. Other cousins, Mrs. Kenrick and Flora
Macartney, live at Ormiston House, that lovely
old stone residence built by the Hon. Louis
Hope (uncle of Lord Hopetoun) what time the
squattocracy ran Cleveland as a rival to Bris-
bane for the honor of being the capital. This
old “town house” of forgotten ambitions is
surrounded by lovely trees and the remains
of a once beautiful ornamental garden. The
Hopes spent a small fortune on azaleas, foun-
tains, etc., and there is an 80-year-old hedge of
hibiscus that is worth going miles to see.
Stella Macartney’s bridegroom is Samuel
Francis, only son of the late Sir Francis Greer,
a famous London barrister, and Lady Greer,
of Stockton-on-Tees.
Two Queenslanders who have done well in
the musical world of London have been bagged
by the 8.8. C. Gertrude Concannon, the
singer with the delicious lyric soprano, has
gathered fresh laurels for her already sizable
wreath since she began broadcasting *in Port-
land-place. Nevertheless, she would like to
return to Australia after several British winters.
Rae Phillips, who began her musical tuition in
Brisbane, left Brisbane about five years ago
to study at the Royal College of Music.
As an accompanist for many well-known
singers, and also for the community singing in
Hyde Park (organised by Ernest Newman), she
has been most successful. She is a member
of the Rita Sharpe trio, which broadcasts for
the 8.8. C., and (great honor for a female!) is
deputy-conductor of the Morley College
orchestra.
Mrs. Stuart Leishman, daughter of the late
W. T. Blakeney, and niece of the late Judge
Blakeney, has a historic right to the good looks
for which she always has been noted. I dis-
covered only the other day that she is a de-
scendant of the beautiful Gunnings. Barnaby
Gunning, brother of Elizabeth and Maria, had
a daughter, Anne, who married Charles Blake-
ney, of Holywell, County Roscommon. Mrs.
Leishman is a direct descendant of this Charles,
and she was born at Blakeney, in Norfolk, a
town which once bore the unlovely name of
Snitterley, but which was allowed to change
its name in consideration of the useful work
done for Henry 111. by John de Blakeney.
Before settling down in Newcastle, Bishop
and Mrs. de Witt Batty, who are returning
from England on the Ormonde, will look in on
Brisbane to see their old friends here. The
bishop’s lady used to oversee the destinies of
St. Martin’s Hospital, and looked so charming
in her matron’s cap that a snow man might
have melted at the sight of her.
Mrs. Gerald Ross Mundy (she was Kath-
leen Hirschfeld, and a daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. E. Hirschfeld), who has been over here
on a holiday, is returning to Colombo and
her Gerald by the Moreton Bay. Before her
marriage, Kathleen was by way of being an
Inky Wayfarer, and, incidentally, was one of
Brisbane’s prettiest girls.
It is to be hoped that no epidemic smites
Brisbane just now, so many of our medi-
coes have packed up their trunks and
scurried off to Tasmania for the medical con-
ference. Dr. and Mrs. Neville Sutton, Dr.
and Mrs. A. V. Meehan (he and Dr. Pat Dixon
do all the orthopaedic work for returned Dig-
gers), Dr. and Mrs. L. Jarvis Nye and Dr.
and Mrs. H. Stanley Waters were among the
last to join the exodus.
Three pretty Brisbane girls arrived in your
Harbor City a day or two ago on holiday bent.
They were Claire Macrossan, daughter of Jus-
tice Hugh Macrossan, whose associate she is;
Jacqueline Carter, whose father is French Con-
sul here; and little Gladys Barlow, who until
recently offsided for Winifred Moore on the
women’s side of the “Courier-Mail” literary
staff.
Pearl Bentley, formerly of Brisbane, who has
been at Kobe for some time, is spending her
furlough in Brisbane. Her friends are vying
with each other in spreading the afternoon-tea
cloth for her.
Rev. Norman Osborn and his wife, of Too-
woomba, are holidaying at Southport. The
padre is one of the few clergymen with an
M.C. won in France.
Died last week, George Harrap at the ripe
age of 90. A teacher in the Old Country, and
trained at St. Mark’s College, Chelsea, he joined
the Queensland Educational Department in
1873, and, after being in charge of the State
schools at Bulimba, North Ipswich and Wool-
loongabba, became a district inspector in 1887.
He saw most of the State, travelling in that
capacity, and after his retirement in 1914 lived
for some years in Toowoomba, where he had
a property, and subsequently with a daughter
at Toowong.
At the end of this week Joan Forth, daugh-
ter of the W. A. Forths, has an important en-
gagement at St. John’s Cathedral with Horace
Driver, member of a family that has lived at
Coorparoo since the days when that suburb
was a forest of gum-trees and neither ’bus nor
tram polluted its virgin glades.
Thelma Nancy Lahey, daughter of the late
Isaiah Lahey (he was a member of that part-
nership of brothers who owned the timber
mill at Canungra and most of the surround-
ing countryside), wears a diamond sparkler be-
stowed by Willis Trenwith Chancellor, only son
of Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Chancellor. The Chan-
cellors are another well-known Brisbane family
who played important parts in Queensland in
the pre-Federal days.

What is the history of the discovery of coal
in W.A.7—9108.
In March, 1839, the Government of the Swan
River colony offered 2560 acres in fee-simple
to any person who discovered any consider-
able bed of coal; the offer was repeated several
times, but, although sporadic efforts were made
to work coal near the Murray River, in the
Irwin district, on the Phillips River fnear
Albany), and at Fly Brook (the south-eastern
tributary of the Donnelly River), no field of
commercial value was found until 1889, when
a carboniferous formation noticed in the Collie
district by a local farmer was proved to be
true coal. A company was formed, but was
obliged to abandon work for lack of capital.
After a favorable report by an expert from
N.S.W. the Government undertook a series of
borings, which proved the existence of a field
about 50 sq. miles in extent with seams of a
total thickness of about 137 ft.; the Collie rail-
way was then built, and operations were begun
on a commercial scale.
(1) When did the first Prussian and Silesian
exiles reach S.A., and by what vessel ? In
what vessels did later batches arrive ? (2) Who
was their leader ? (3) For what reason did
they leave Prussia ? —9710.
(1) The first shipload of Prussian and Silesian
exiles left Hamburg in the Prince George and
reached Adelaide on November 16, 1838. Other
batches followed in the Bengalee, Catherine
and Zebra. (2) August Kavel, a minister of
the evangelical Lutheran Church at Klemzig
in eastern Brandenburg, Prussia. (3) The Prus-
sian Government imposed on the Lutherans
a liturgy of which they disapproved. Kavel’s
congregation, along with many others, being
determined not to yield to the Government in
matters of religion, sent Kavel to London to
interview George Fife An gas about arranging
for their settlement in the new colony of S.A.
(1) What honors were accorded to Premier
Seddon, of Maoriland ? (2) Was he ever-
offered a title? —97l9.
(1) Cambridge (.1897) and Edinburgh (1902)
gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of
Laws. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1897.
St. Helens (Lancashire) and the Scottish
boroughs of Edinburgh and Annan conferred
their Freedom on him in 1902, and he was
made an Associate of the American Institute
of Mining Engineers, a life member of the
Geographical Society of California and W.G.M.
of the Masonic Lodge of New Zealand. (2)
Such matters are not recorded, but it was well
understood that Seddon would not accept a
knighthood or even a baronetage.
What evidence is there that Lord Howe Island
originally formed part of the M.L. volcanic
area ? —9711.
A, R. Wallace noted that a submerged bank
extends at a depth of about 1000 ft. from the
northern M.L. peninsula westerly to Lord
Howe Island; this is confirmed by the sound-
ings made by the Challenger expeditions. The
connection with M.L. has further corrobora-
tion from the similarity of fauna and flora.
How did Sunday or Raoul Island, in the
Kermadec Group, come to have two names .
D’Entrecasteaux, in search of La Perouse,
discovered the island on March 17, 1793, and
named it Raoul Island, after his first quarter-
master, Joseph Raoul. It was next visited by
Col. David Collins, then Judge- Advocate at
Sydney, in the Britannia, on November 6, 1796,
who, not knowing the French had already dis-
covered it, named it Sunday because it was
sighted on that day.
(1) Exactly where is the Apia Observatory'
situated ? ' (2) By whom was it founded, and
for what purpose ? (3) Who finances it ? (4)
What constitutes its especial value ? —9684.
(1) Near the end of Mulinu’u Peninsula, on
the island of Upolu, a mile and a half from
Apia. (2) By the Society of Natural Sciences
of Gottingen (Germany) 30 years ago, for the
purpose of taking observations simultaneously
with those of an Antarctic expedition. The
results were of such value that the observatory
was made permanent and its scope was ex-
tended to include more detailed observations
in magnetism, meteorology, seismology and re-
lated subjects. (3) The M.L. Government,
assisted by grants from the British Admiralty
and the Carnegie Institute. (4) Remoteness
from all other observatories and from all con-
tinents. It is the co-ordinating centre for the
wireless weather stations of the South Pacific.
Who was Alfred Loewenstein ? —9688.
A Belgian financier who was a prominent
international figure in the sphere of hydro-
electric development. His services in this con-
nection and his financial services to the Allies
in the Great War were recognised with the
honor of C.B. from Great Britain. He was
also prominently associated with the promotion
of the artificial-silk industry. It was stated
that he had projected a scheme for acquiring
control of the Bank of Brussels, but this ana
other financial secrets died with him when he
fell out of an aeroplane while crossing the
English Channel in July, 1928.
(1) What is the Koran? (2) What doctrines
are expounded in it ? —9699.
(1) The holy book of Mohammedanism, a
record of the revelations given to Mohammed
by Allah and compiled after the prophet’s
death by his secretary, Zaid-ibn-Thabit, by
order of the Caliph Abu Bekir. The earliest
scripts are in Arabic, and consist of 114 suras
or chapters, which are arranged according to
size, the longest first. (2) The chief doctrine
is Unitarian —one God, one true faith (Moham-
medanism) and a day of judgment. The Koran
concedes Moses and Christ rank as prophets,
but lower than Mohammed.
A daughter, instead of earning a living, has
devoted herself to the nursing of an invalid
parent who is an old-age pensioner. Upon the
death of the parent the C’wealth Government
can now recover out of the property of the
pensioner the amount of pension paid after
October 12, 1932. This action would impose
hardship on the daughter. Can she claim a stay
of proceedings? —9s2s.
She may apply to the Commissioner of Pen-
sioners for the exemption of the property or
estate either wholly or in part from the charge,
or for the postponement of the charge until
some other specified claim is satisfied, or until
the death of the person interested. Relief
under this provision is given only in cases of
hardship.
What has the N.S.W. Traffic Act to say
about (1) overtaking on bridges, (2) obstruct-
ing free passage of vehicles, and (3) passing
on left side when meeting ? —9634.
(1) Drivers are forbidden to pass vehicles or
horses going in the same direction. (2) Negli-
gent or wilful obstruction is forbidden. (3)
The driver, when meeting a horse or vehicle,
must pass on his left side. When overtaking
a horse or vehicle he must pass on the right
side of it and not pull over to the left side
until his vehicle is clear. He must indicate
his desire to pass by sounding his alarm.
How do the Qommonwealth immigration
laws apply in the case of an Australian who
is married to a native of Samoa and who wishes
to return to Australia with his wife ? —9315.
It would be contrary to the White Australia
policy to admit permanently a full-blooded
Samoan woman married to an Australian. If
application for temporary admission were made
to the Department of the Interior, giving par-
ticulars as to the proposed length of stay and
object of the visit, the matter would receive
consideration.
In the event of the Governor of N. S. Wales
being absent from the State, who acts in his
stead ? —9712.
The Lieut.-Gov. To that office the Chief
Justice is usually appointed. If a person eli-
gible to serve as Lieut.-Governor is not avail-
able, the senior Judge of the State is appointed
Administrator.
Method of glueing the handle of a cricket
bat into a blade, and kind of glue to use ?
9639.
If a new blade is being used, scratch with
the side of a file- the inside edges of the splice,
making certain that they are perfectly straight.
Slightly “V” the bottom of the socket, using
a 3-16 in. or |in. chisel. The handle should
then be planed to the same taper as the socket
of the blade, bottom being slightly “V’d” —so
planed that when pressed into the socket there
is still a 3-16 in. gap. This, when the handle
is finally tapped into place, will insure a fight
grip between the walls of the blade and the face
of the handle. The joint should then be glued
—make certain that socket and handle get a
good coat of glue—and the handle firmly
tapped into place. Do not tap too hard
once joints are butted, otherwise you may
split the blade. The handle should, in
the completed job, incline slightly to an angle
on the face of the blade, so that if a straight
edge is laid along the face of the blade it wifi
finish 4in. inside the outside periphery of the
top of the handle. “Gripit” is the glue' for
the job.
How to grow bulbs in fibre in bowls which
have no holes in them for drainage .—9760.
Scrub the bowls thoroughly, fill them with
fibre to lin. from the rim, and plant the bulbs,
leaving the tops projecting. Moisten the fibre
regularly, and keep the bowls m a shady
corner until the shoots appear; then bring the
bowls into the light gradually. Excessive mois-
ture can be got rid of by tilting the bowls
and pouring it off. This must be done gingerly
so as not to disturb the bulbs or break the
root-growth. When the flowering season is
over cease watering, and let the bulbs dry out.
Fresh bulbs should be obtained every year , tor
this sort of culture.
I wish to make a corner for native flowers
in my garden. (1) How should I prepate the
beds ? (2) Suitable varieties ? —9744.
(1) Remove at least 2ft. of soil, pack into
the bed rotting logs and large, flat stones, and
refill with bush soil containing rotted leaves,
charcoal and decayed mould. The stones are
necessary to provide drainage. Nursery-grown
plants are obtainable, and can be set in posi-
tion, while seed can be sown in boxes to raise
more stock. (2) Among the shrubs are Christ-
mas bush (Ceratopetalum gummiferum ); wara-
tah ( Telopea speciosissima) ; kangaroo paw
( Anigozanthus manglesii)', boronia (Mega-
stigma; Ovata, pink flowers; Serrulata, ser-
rated foliage and bright pink flowers); Swan
River daisy (Brachycome) ; callistemon or bottle
brushes (Lanceolatus; Cocinus, bright red
flowers); chorizema (Cor data, red flowers;
Dicksoni, orange blooms); bird flower (Crota-
laria laburnifolia ); native fuchsia ( Epacris lon-
gifiora); acacias or wattles (in big variety);
eugenia or lillipilly; and tea-tree (Leptosper-
mum). Small-growing plants include flannel
flower (Actinotus grandiflora), Christmas bells
(Blandifordia nobilis), Geraldton wax-flower
(Chamcelancium uncinatum ), and Sturt desert-
pea (Clianthus dampieri ). Don’t use animal
manures or strong chemical fertilisers.
What are the qualifications for selection as
a pupil of the Q’land Aero Club’s flying school ?
—9720.
He must have reached the age of 18 years.
If under the age of 21 years he must obtain
the consent of his parents or guardian. He
must be a British subject, and he must submit
to medical examination.
How can I remove 'mildew stain from black
imitation leather book-bindings? —9654.
Get a tin of saddle soap and a tin of saddle
paste from any leather shop. Apply the soap
to the books lightly and sparingly with a
flannel until clean; then apply the paste in
the same way and polish with a silk cloth.
How to treat white kalsomined plaster ceil-
ing badly discolored and cracked by water ?
—9666.
Brush with a hard scrubbing brush to dis-
lodge all loose flakes. Mend cracks with
plaster. Give a coat of wall-size and water,
and when thoroughly dry paint with any de-
sired interior paint or kalsomine.
How to make sandsoap ? —9646.
Put into a kerosene-tin 51b. clean, clarified
fat free from salt, lib. resin and 5 quarts water.
Bring to the boil, then add slowly, and in
small quantities, 2 quarts water in which has
been soaked all night lib. caustic soda. Boil
all slowly for half an hour, and lift from the
stove to cool until next day. A little while
after removing from the fire, and while it is
still fluid, stir in as much clean sharp sand
as the soap will take up. When cold, cut
into blocks.
1 have a steel engraving of a battle scene
by Thomas Jones Barker, published in 1860.
Can you tell me anything about Barker and
the possible value of the engraving? —966l.
T. J. Barker painted in the worst period of
English art and lived down to it. No engrav-
ing of his work is worth more than 15s.
What is the especial musical significance of
the round “Sumer is Icumen In” ? —9700.
It is a six-part canon which, as far as re-
search can determine, was written about 1240
by John of Fornsete, a monk of Reading
Abbey, In musical style it is a good two
or three centuries ahead of its time. Its authen-
ticity has stood all tests, and it remains the
foremost mystery of musical history.
(1) Was Franz Schubert a heavy drinker,
and did this contribute to his early death ? (2)
What was the cause of his death ? —9707.
(1) He was not a teetotaller —of this there
is abundant evidence in all records of his life
—but the normal life of a young man in
Vienna in his day involved spending evenings
in a cafe where beer and wine were on tap.
There is no evidence that he habitually ex-
ceded. Grove writes in his “Dictionary”:
“How could a sot —how could anyone who
even lived freely and woke with a heavy head
or a disordered stomach-have worked as he
worked?... .He loved society and its accom-
paniments; he would have been no Viennese if
he had not; and he may have been occasion-
ally led away; but such escapades were rare.”
(2) It was not diagnosed. The symptoms were
“increasing weakness, want of sleep and great
depression.”
How much did it cost to make a Stradi-
varius violin ? —9709.
No accounts are available. Considering the
genius of the maker, it might be as profitable
to ask how much of Chopin’s house-rent
accrued while he was composing his best-loved
mazurka. But the monetary costs were un-
doubtedly very small. Thibouville-Lamy, of
Paris, a maker of violins 50 years ago, com-
piled a table of the minimum cost of a violin
(material and labor) of a standard that he
would put out of his factory and not be totally
ashamed of. Timber cost 5d.; carvers’ time,
2s. 64d.; varnishing, lOd.; fittings (strings,
pegs, bridge, tailpiece) and labor cost of assem-
bling, 94d. Overhead was 6 p.c., and the
maker reckoned on 15 p.c. profit, bringing the
selling price to 4s. 6d. Going back 200 years
to Antoni Stradivari, the labor and material
costs were probably quite a lot less, even
though he hadn’t the machines Thibouville-
Lamy used to fashion back and belly. Through-
out the ages money values decrease in terms
of labor.
Why are operas performed in Australia not
sung in English ? —9672.
The stock excuses for non-translation are
(1) that the Italian language is more suited
to be sung than is English, (2) that the Italian
singers usually imported for such occasions can
do themselves better justice in their own
tongue than in an alien one, and (3) that such
translations as are available are very poor.
This refers to French and German operas as
well as Italian. When German operas are
performed by Germans, it is explained (the
other excuses being unavailable) that it would
be sacrilege to sing them in any other tongue.

•... -8. V.: Has some quality, but the appeal is
laint Jay: That yarn about ringing the
changes is a hoary chestnut. It has
even been done in verse—by W. T.
Goodge... .E.H.M.: You may be able
to kiss charmingly, but you rhyme abom-
inably J.R.R.: Wasted effort H.S.: Not
snappy enough. And there’s more than an
echo of Lewis Carroll in the longer piece....
G. : A tale of chivalry should be less tangled;
can’t get the hang of yours... .W.H.: “Suc-
cess” unsuccessful —too ploddingly didactic....
E.H.: “Tea-ed” looks an awkward word in
print, but it is surely as defensible as “break-
fasted,” “lunched,” “dined” or “supped,” which
nobody, dreams of querying K.H.: A mere
string of copybook headings... .A.E.W.: Quite
sound philosophy, but there’s no lilt in it.
....C.E.M.: Can’t fathom the reason for
the abrupt ending L.H.: A respect-
able sonnet, but lacking in distinction.
Impossible to send detailed criticisms by
post J.T.R.: Sheer rigmarole, and some
of your rhymes set our teeth on edge.
.. .F.F.C.: That theme has long since been
worn threadbare, and you don’t infuse any-
thing fresh into it....A.H.: Quite unusable,
and no photo, would make it less 50....
R. :On the commonplace side... .C. 8.8.:
Don’t worry about your verses losing their
point unless printed promptly—they haven’t
any to 105 e... .H.A.: Any interest it may have
is purely personal M.P.L.: Spring is a long
way off, and your “fantasy” wouldn’t get past
if it were here.... J.W.: The theme is rather
a good one, but your Muse is a heavy-footed
lady 8.Y.: Nothing wrong with the sonnet,
as such, but Norse maidens and sagas and
runes and halberds are a bit off our beat....
A.L.8.: You emphasise that you aren’t a
parson and then shoot a raggedly-rhymed ser-
mon at u5....V.H.: Light, and the end takes
a lot of swallowing J.W.C.: It went on
and on without a gleam. .. .R.H.W.: Some-
thing in it, but you don’t present your
picture of the old-timer clearly enough.
A.M.C.: A sympathetic study which
moves evenly until it becomes unintelligible at
the close... .L.W.: Juvenile in conception....
S. : Well done in its way, but the ending
is inartistic W.E.8.: No, again R.J.R.:
You won’t “break into journalism” with stuff
like that. Better give prose a try... .G.R.: Too
long-drawn-out... .F.L.: “Vignette” is the best
of the bunch, but it doesn’t quite click
P.J.1.: Too labored, and words like “clere-
story” and “cirrus” hardly fit into a swag-
man’s repertory C.0.C.: Nothing in it....
J.G.: Quite respectable verse, but it doesn’t
stir or stick... .J.D.: Too much leading up to
a trite finish... .Jada: Pretty enough, but
we don’t feature any houses in Arcady
A.E.S.: Don’t like turning it down, but the
theme is outworn... .Aby: Lots of moral but
no sparkle... .J.A.P.: Our opinion is that it
is poor stuff, even for an obituary... .M.N.:
You throw your adjectives about too lavishly.
...A.L.: You have a long way to g 0....
E.M.F.: Characterisations weak... .L.R.: For
a start; make them talk like everyday bush
people... .N.P.: Your tender years earned you
a pardon J.H.C.: Somebody put a jelly-
fish in somebody else’s bed, and you take 4000
words to record the occurrence D.R.: You
are much too morbidly inclined for one so
young... .J.E.J.: They don’t resemble Aus-
tralian detectives. .. .M.L.G.: It howled to go
back... .R.L.: Old p10t... .A.C.: The w.p.b.,
not the printer, got it... .X.H.: Neither hit the
mark.... J.E.C.: Have read brighter elephant
yarns... .A.C.W.: Couldn’t get worked up
over the magpie. .. .H.F.J.: You’re right; yours
is a “totally inexperienced hand”... .A.D.: Too
small for our mesh R.K.D.C.: Needs
further improvement.... J.K. J.: Only a par. in
it R.J.C.: Unconvincing... .J.C.S.: Both

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Exdig”: I have just come across a
press item about the return to Australia
of two men who were repatriated to
England from Westralia four years ago bv
public subscription, after making a loud
song about their disillusionment and
attempting to stow away. That sort of
thing happens quite often; the only
period in my experience when the
grumbling immigrant wasn’t in evidence
was that immediately after the war. The
reinforcement with which I left was
about 30 per cent. English, and most of
these frankly told us that one of their
motives in enlisting was to get back to
England, where they intended to stay
when the war was over. I think that
there were few who survived the war
that didn’t change their minds after a
fresh look at the conditions they had left
and outgrown. It is significant that the
majority of those who applied for dis-
charge in England were young Austra-
lians looking for an extension of foreign
adventure, not ex-Englishmen.

“Prosit”: There were heroes before
Hitler in Germany, and the anniversary
of one of them has just been appropriately
celebrated. This was Burgomaster Nusch,
of Rothenburg, who, when Tilly was
about to give the town and its inhabitants
up to sack and the sword, as was the
agreeable custom in 1634, saved the city
and its citizens by his own unaided effort.
Tilly was informing the burgomaster of
his intentions in the City Hall when he
espied a vast glass beaker and asked
what it was. Nusch explained that
it held a gallon of wine and that there
was a standing offer of remission of rates
and taxes to any citizen who could drain
it at a draught. Tilly, a sportsman evi-
dently, offered to spare Rothenburg and
its inhabitants if the burgomaster could
turn the trick himself. This he did, and
Tilly kept his word. The annual play
reproducing the incident nowadays draws
almost as good houses from all over Ger-
many as Oberammergau does from
Europe and the world at large, the story
being full of what Hollywood calls
“human interest.”
* * * *
“Chizz”: A pakeha party duplicated
a 500-year-old Maori achievement at
New Year, when they lit a fire at the
summit of Mount Egmont. The first
man to climb Egmont was a chieftain
named Tahurangi, who, according to
legend, did the job about 1420, and when
he reached the top lit a fire to show that
he had accomplished the climb and
taken possession of the mountain for his
tribe. Old Maoris still say, when wisps
of cloud encircle the summit and blow
off like smoke, “Te ahi a Tahurangi”
(“The smoke from Tahurangi’s fire!”).
* ¥ * *
“Phillabeg”: Add another objection to
kilts as part of an efficient military uni-
form (B. 3/1 / ’34). In grass-seed country
the lower edges rapidly become band-
saws which fray the knees of the wearers
to raw flesh in a very short time. I can
recall a battalion of the Argyle and
Sutherland which was practically reduced
to impotence from this cause near Bel-
fast in the Eastern Transvaal during the
Boer War. In their torture the men tore
up all available parts of their lighter
clothing to bandage their legs against
the matted seed, and bits of bagging and
almost every other form of textile handy
was snatched up for the same purpose.
One of their officers told me similar
trouble had occurred occasionally dur-
ing summer campaigning on the n.-w.
frontier of India, but never so seriously
as on this occasion.
* * * *
“Quarter Butt”: After the rather weari-
some clashing of Lindrum, Newman and
co., the billiard-following English public
has found the boys’ championship, just
ended in London, a refreshing relief. The
pair left in the final this year were Swin-
hoe, 12L years old, and Cruickshank, a
full 13. They played three sessions of
250 each, and Swinhoe finally won after
a neck-and-neck battle in which the
youngsters knocked off breaks of 40- and
50-odd without turning a hair. Herbert
Spencer once said of a young man who
beat him at billiards that his proficiency
argued a misspent youth. I wonder what
the philosopher would have thought if
stacked up against these champions only
a little removed from the nursery.
* * * *
“Yarker”: In spite of much soft
sawder from the higher-ups, there is a
nasty undercurrent of feeling against
Australian cricket in evidence in many
of the English newspapers. One Thomp-
son, described as sporting expert of the
Yorkshire “Observer,” a reputable jour-
nal, says of the Australian team:
They are definitely coming now that the
partly framed-up and partly serious body-
line controversy has been washed overboard,
not to die, but to be submerged for the
moment, until perhaps it is again necessary
for England to apply the works like Australia
showed us a few years ago.
In other words, Australia is t& be double-
crossed, if necessary. Australians will
want a lot more than Thompson’s word
for it that this is likely.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: Joyce Wethered has
denied that she intends to tour America
giving exhibitions of the game for
payment. Still, Joyce is already on
the edge of the money game since she
is “golf adviser” to a great store in Lon-
don’s West End, a job which brings her
perilously close to the recent St. Andrews
definition of a professional. Though not
playing much big golf nowadays, her
game seems as perfect as ever. Enid
Wilson, three times champion of Britain,
reckons Joyce six strokes ahead of any
woman player in the world.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Nature’ latest gift to N.S.W. South
Coast farmers was rain that poured for
three days till 18 inches of it had fallen,
and the Clyde River was a swollen roar-
ing torrent that carried away the ferry at
Nelligen and broke the cables of the punt
at Bateman’s Bay. Bateman’s was iso-
lated ; the same fate befell Bega and
Moruya. The waters crept over the town-
ships into many of the houses, till families
were driven from their homes. Bridges and
fences were swept away; orchards were
stripped, crops beaten down by hail-
stones reported to have been as big as
eggs. With thunder and lightning and
fireballs this storm of unusual ferocity
broke over the southern half of the
State, smiting Wagga, Young, Albury,
Bodalla, Narooma and Tilba, and reserv-
ing its special fury for Orbost, over the
border, where some of the richest land
in Australia will perforce be idle for a
twelvemonth. Parts of the Prince’s High-
way were turned first into a swirling
torrent and then into a succession of
lakes. Hundreds of motorists (hosts of
them holiday-makers) were marooned in
the flood areas, many travellers were
stuck for over two days on the road, and
the string of cars on the Sydney side of
the Clyde River waiting for the punt
repairs at Bateman’s was reminiscent of
a public holiday hold-up in Sydney’s bad
old punt days.
Held up on the Prince’s Highway by
the floods, the driver of a motor-coach
travelling from Sydney to Melbourne
decided to get on to the Hume Highway
and so continue the journey to Mel-
bourne. The rear axle broke when the
car was travelling along a smooth bit just
out of Gundagai. The wife of Percy S.
Allen, of “S. M. Herald” staff, was one
of three who were killed ; Mrs. Louis
Keogh, of Elwood (Vie.), and Joan
Madeline Croft, an Auckland girl in her
early twenties, were the two other victims
of the smash.
A father’s anxiety to reach the bed-
side of his sick daughter was the impetus
behind last week’s flight across the
continent. W. A. Mackay, senior
partner in the shipping firm of Mac-
donald, Hamilton, was in Perth when a
telephone message summoned him to
Sydney, where daughter Margot lay criti-
cally ill in St. Luke’s. There were no
commercial ’planes to be hired, so Mr.
Mackay boarded the trans. express. Then
the Perth Aero Club took a hand, and,
while the train was rattling to Kalgoorlie,
mechanics at the Aero Club were busy
getting their only available Moth ready
for flight. Piloted by Max Allen it caught
Mr. Mackay next morning at Kalgoor-
lie. At Ceduna another ’plane had to
be called in, and the journey was com-
pleted in a second Moth, flown by Cap-
tain Miller, of Adelaide. The whole
width of the continent, 2500 miles, was
traversed in three days. From Mascot
the worried parent rushed straight to the
hospital, but his little girl’s condition was
unchanged, as it unfortunately was when
this Letter made last-minute inquiries.
Mrs. Faviell, who was Audrey Pick-
burn, has married Jim Chisholm, of
Burmah, up Inverell way. The bride-
groom is a son of the Frank Chisholms,
of Kippilaw, Goulburn; the bride is
the daughter of Mrs. F. F. A. Pickburn,
who, since her husband’s death (he was
Judge Pickburn), has successfully run
de luxe guest-houses and the exclusive
little Garden Club at Elizabeth Bay. Both
mother and daughter have good looks, tall
figures and that elusive quality that we
call charm. Mrs. Chisholm clothed the
whole of her share of the above in misty
pink marocain, on which bloomed a
shoulder spray of pink tiger-lilies. Her hat
had a shallow crown, a wide brim that
swept down over the right eye, and was
of cinnamon-brown straw. Mrs. Pickburn,
who gathered a small group of friends
around her at the Australia after the
wedding in the Registrar’s office, wore
her black-and-white patterned chiffons,
her black straw hat and her spray of
frangipanni with the right mixture of
dignity and festivity. Commander Gif-
ford came down from his holiday fast-
ness in Leura for the wedding, and
’groom’s brother Tom was another of the
toast-drinkers.
The achievement of the young Sara-
cen lady who pursued her crusader to
London, that city’s and the young man’s
names being the only English words she
knew, has been beaten. Last week a
small Russian girl, travelling all alone,
arrived in Sydney on her way to Maori-
land, and she without one word of Eng-
lish. She is Galya Bogatiroff and she
was left behind with two aunts in Siberia
when mother and father had to fly the
Bolsheviks and the country.
Through the Red Cross in Enzed,
aided and abetted by the International Red
Cross, the youngster is now being restored
to her parents, Xenophon Bogatiroff and
his wife, who have their home in Foxton
(M.L.). The soil, the geographers tell us,
freezes many feet deep in Siberia, and
in addition there are the terrible burans
or snowstorms, so when little Galya feels
the freezing winds sweeping down on her
from the Tararua and Ruahine ranges
she can close her eyes and pretend she
is back among the steppes. A little girl
from Siberia should feel thoroughly at
home in Foxton.
Sophie Segaert, a daughter of Belgium’s
Consul-General, is known to the French-
speaking community as a clever amateur
actress. She has appeared in several of
the plays produced by her father, who
has an unusual talent for theatricals. Miss
Segaert will be one of the brides of the
near future. She has recently become
engaged to Fraser Wesley Coss, barrister,
of Wollstonecraft. Dayne made the
picture.
Mrs. F. J. Davy’s family dinner party
brought to a speedy end the life adven-
tures of several country-bred turkeys. The
dinner was of great dimensions and was
in honor of Mrs. Davy’s mother, Mrs.
Jarvie. Mrs. Jarvie is one of four sisters,
and they were all gathered around the
board, though one, Mrs. R. A. Gale, had
to journey from Nandi in Fiji, where
her husband is a planter, and another,
Mrs. Pulsford, came from beyond In-
verell. The other sister present was Miss
Kennedy.
It has become so fashionable to crowd
into the studio on opera broadcast nights
that at “II Trovatore” one row of seats
was marked “reserved,” and word was
breathed that they were the vice-regal
seats. But the vice-res. being at Sutton
Forest and Canberra lesser mortals were •
allowed to occupy them. Worked up by
the story of Azucena’s wrongs and re-
venge, conductor Aldrovandi, of the slim
waist, swung his baton about as though
it were a pair of Indian clubs. Occa-
sionally he did physical jerks with his
knee, or flung out a clutching hand to
the chorus, as though he would draw out
all the voices by the root and fhng
them into the gaping maw of the orches-
tra. His was a spirited performance. So
was that of Lionel Cecil, who rode his
high notes to the stars as the unfortunate
young troubadour who crashed into his
important brother’s love affairs.
This is Matron Pettiford, who, on
behalf of the Child Welfare Department,
guides the course of affairs at Bidura, the
Girls’ Home at Glebe. Matron is a
native of Condobolin, and has many
friends in Narrandera, for she completed
her training at Narrandera General after
working through the South Sydney
Women’s Hospital. Before she went to
Glebe, Garth, the Children’s Home at
Willoughby, was under her kindly care
for four years. The photograph is from
May Moore.
Margaret Gillespie, of Warrawee, who
has just put one tour in Europe behind
her, has her face set towards another.
This time she will go as the bride of
padre Terence Naughton, of Hunter’s
Hill. The two will be wed at St. Philip’s
on Church Hill at the end of January by
Bishop Kirkby, and then sail off by way
of Canada.
John Woods, the Neutral Bay boy who
played juvenile leads in J. C. Williamson
productions for three or four years and
then went off to London, hopped straight
into a part (there were 50 after it) in a
revival of “Charley’s Aunt” at the Gaiety.
Actress Mary Macgregor, of the red-
gold hair, who is trying her luck in the
same big city, has a tiny flat Mayfair way,
and here John and other Australians fore-
gather. Mary (so John says) isn’t a very
good cook, so he pops into the kitchen
and gets busy with the griller.
The original Anthony Hordern might
have blinked if he had foreseen the
arrival of a crocodile in the emporium
he founded. A happy one made up of
Far West (N.S.W.) kiddies wound its way
over every inch of the enormous Brick-
field Hill establishment, from the spot in
Swan-lane where the lorries are loaded to
the art gallery. These youngsters take a
wreath of bays for good behavior, and
boredom has not yet entered into their
scheme of things. After their long hike
the girls and boys of the Golden West
descended, even as a swarm of well-
mannered but thoroughly efficient locusts,
on the tea-party spread for them in the
welfare hall.
The first organisation to throw off that
after-Christmas somnolence and to indi-
cate that life is real, life is earnest, was
the Women’s Country Club. It got into
its stride again last week with a farewell
party to Senator Kingsmill’s lady and
Mrs. Lionel Cooke. The former will
stay in Melbourne with niece Kathleen
Goodall while her husband is in West-
ralia, where he says he will spend most
of his time fishing. Melbourne also is
the objective of Mrs. Cooke. Lome
Wilson, who with her mother has come
from Urunga to live in Sydney, was
among the artists on a programme
arranged by the musicianly Mrs. Stephen
Herford. Jean Grant, who added her
quota to the afternoon’s melody, gathered
in a small pile of sympathetic posies and
gifts, for Jean is being parked away in
hospital this week.
Have you noticed this past week the
laughs running up every street and the
dimples lurking around every corner?
Well, you can credit the 60 Westralian
schoolgirls who are visiting Sydney, for
they let the lot loose from the minute
they stepped off the Zealandia. A dash
up the Mountains was one of the pearls
of a trip which so far has taken in Adel-
aide and Tasmania. The youngsters look
very smart in their blue flannel skirts
(Westralian flannel, they’ll inform you)
and zip-fastened jumpers with the ini-
tials of their State blazoned on them in
white. The W.A. Federation of Parents
and Citizens arranged the tour.
On Saturday afternoon a cool wind
ruffled the greeny waters of the Domain
baths and the bright sun caught the
whitely punctuated lines that marked off
the laneways. The stands were filled
(not packed) with grown-ups, but along
the edges of the baths girls and boys
stood, squatted or sat on the edge of
the platform, excited legs dangling above
the water. Through the Domain, past the
green lawns, past the statue of Henry
Lawson, taxi-loads of girls had rushed ;
small companies of girls had walked
swiftly; fathers and mothers, aunts and
uncles had arrived more sedately. A
group of cyclists in trig blue slacks and
sweaters leaned against their machines at
the sun-washed entrance.
The big draw of the afternoon was, of
course, Joyce Cooper, the blonde cham-
pion of the British Empire ; but all the
naiads had their applauders, and the
baths shook to the encouraging shouts of
the bystanders as white caps and red
caps, green caps and blue caps sped up
the waterways, the bodies behind them
half-hidden in the smother of foam
threshed up by the firm legs. Not till
after the heats of the fifties, twenty-fives
and thirty-threes had been run off did
the pistol crack for the hundred yards
State championship. This was Joyce
Cooper’s first appearance, and all eyes
were focussed on the slim girl who up to
the time of her race wore black slacks
and a black pullover. Up No. 3 lane
with a lovely, smooth movement came
Joyce, her red cap taking the lead, but
the cream cap of little Pat Norton, from
Bondi, hung on persistently, and, though
Joyce won the race in lmin. 3 4-ssec., the
little fifteen-year-old wonder made the
splendid time of lmin. 4 2-ssec., clip-
ping a fragment off Jean Cocks’s record,
and thereby becoming State champion.
Bathurst and Orange were tied to-
gether in a true lover’s knot last week
when Margaret Vyner Robertson and
Stewart Stevenson became one in All
Saints’ Cathedral, Bathurst, the bride’s
home town. Roy Suttor, of Brucedale,
Peel, armed his niece to the altar, and
her stiffened parchment laces, through
which the satin beneath gleamed mistily,
were followed by three ’maids in vellum
taffetas. Margaret’s mother, Mrs. W. V.
Robertson, received the wedding guests,
150 of them, at Brucedale, the home
founded by the bride’s great-grandfather,
George Suttor.
The little Russian girl Galya Boga-
tiroff went off to Maoriland by the Wan-
ganella on Saturday, her hands filled with
gaily colored streamers, the other ends
of which were held by her Sydney friends.
Her days here were spent as a guest of
the R. J. Hawkes family at Kirribilli. '

Melbourne
Chatter
Traps lurk in some of the crinkly
materials so fashionable just now. A.
Melbourne matron sallied forth to a
bridge party feeling pleased with her new
dress, which clung sheathlike as an extra
skin. In the tram she had cause for
alarm, for the garment was so tight that
she couldn’t sit down without risking a
split seam. The crinkly stuff had dropped
lengthwise, that which was a fashionable
garment in the fitting-room becoming a
skimpy tube. Its owner dashed home,
threw on something old and uninterest-
ing, and was unpopular, for she’d held
up the party.
Mermaids from four universities were
entertained by Mrs. Peter MacCallum, of
Black Rock. A dark grey sky and cold
scudding rain made the beach something
to be avoided, so instead of a swim
there was tea and chatter. The girls
were shown round the house and grounds
the old homestead has historical in-
terest, for it’s on the verge of its 100th
birthday. Hydrangeas and agapanthus
made a cheery show within doors.
A fire engine is not as easy to balance
upon as it looks ; hence the squeals of
lasses with wind-blown hair who were
given their first ride on that type of
vehicle. With most of the “Gay Divorce”
co. on board, four engines swooped round
and round the island gardens, much to
the astonishment of traffic in Victoria-
parade. The ride was part of the Metro-
politan Fire Brigade’s entertaining morn-
ing for the co. It started with a thirst-
quencher and finished with a panoramic
look at Melbourne from the watch tower.
Stage folk are always appreciative of
other people’s star turns, and prolonged
was the applause evoked by the firemen’s
athletic display. The girls, like a lot of
twittering birds on a perch, squeezed up
together on a form in the courtyard.
They made much of “Tiger,” a five-
months-old fireman of the future, joined
with the band in “Our Miss Gibbs,” and
had thrills from watching leaps into
sheets and unfurling ladders. Chief-officer
Wilkins, Phil Finkelstein, Gus Bluett,
overflowing with life, Mona Potts and
Billy Milton were there. Madge Aubrey
was game for a stunt, accepting an invi-
tation to be hauled aloft upon a rope, and
little Isabel Mahon shinned up a ladder
to descend as an “unconscious patient.”
These two declare themselves fit to face
any fire, even if it means rescue from a
skyscraper.
Mrs. Ted Dyson gave a cocktail party
which followed on with dancing and hot-
dogs. Daughter June and her young
niece from Sydney, Jacqueline Boyes,
were let loose with paint and brushes in
the barn, the result being prancing figures
on a level with monster Chinese lanterns.
Mrs. Dyson’s decolletage was filmed with
black lace; the two attractive young
cousins were in white.
The Victoria League is beaming with
complacence, for during the centenary
there’s to be a special exhibition of
furniture of the Victorian era. After
several years Mary Chomley has re-
turned to Melbourne (before her depar-
ture from this city she pushed the
league’s secretarial pen). While in Lon-
don she trod the carpets of Kensington
Palace alongside the league’s founder,
the Dowager-Countess of Jersey. To-
gether they chose relics of Queen Vic-
toria which the King has offered to lend
to the State named after his grandmother.
Queen Mary has shown her interest by
presenting Melbourne with a piece of
the late Queen’s property, a firescreen,
the wool embroideries of which depict
the gambols of dogs and a long-tailed
macaw, escaped from South America.
The design is copied from a Landseer
picture.
Tenants are expected at the Stanley
Bruces’ Frankston mansion. They are
the widow of Admiral Bridges—he was
lord of the manor upon the famous
Trawalla and Yancoate —and her son
Jack. Her daughters made brilliant
matches. Alfreda became the wife of
Sir Hamnet Share, gentleman-in-waiting
to the King, and Alys married Geoffrey
Luttrell, who came to Australia as
A.D.C. to his uncle, Lord Novar. The
Luttrells’ castle is Namely Dunster, in
Somerset. In between the birth of their
two sons —one is at Eton and the other’s
just four months old—they adopted a
small girl.
In Queen’s College chapel Rev. J. W.
Grove made fast the marriage knot be-
tween his eldest son, Dr. John Lewers
Grove, and Helen Mary Rex, of Toorak
daughter of the late Dr. John Rex, of
New Norfolk, Tas. The bridal satins ran
to puffed sleeves and a brief train, and
from the bouquet arose a tropical frag-
rance of frangipanni. A pair of ’maids,
Nancy Brain, in mignonette-green and
water-lilies, and Mollie Grove, in Patou-
pink and an armful of dahlias and del-
phiniums, followed in the bridal wake.
Toasts and speeches were served by Mrs.
Rex at the Windsor.
Geelong had its romance last week
with the marriage of Lilian Willis and
George Frederick Belcher. The wedding
attire of silver lame showed a sculptured
line to the knee ; thence it escaped into
godets and a fishtail train. The neck-
line was softened with folds and a twist
of silver lay around the waist. In a pinky
cloud were attendants Myrtle Jacobs and
Nancy Belcher. The pearls clasped to
their bandeaux and their water-lily
bouquets were shot with a similar tint
to their frilled and trained georgettes.
Guests made merry at the Corio Club.
The older generation is agog with the
marriage, wrapped in secrecy until prac-
tically the day before it was solemnised,
of Prof. Tucker and Mrs. Theyre Weigall.
The eminent authority on classical
philology was Dean of the Faculty of
Arts and has compiled several textbooks
and a Latin dictionary. The bride (her
daughter is Mrs. Daryl Lindsay) is musi-
cal ; she’s the widow of Judge Weigall
and a daughter of the late Sir Robert
Hamilton, one-time Governor of Tas.
Elizabeth, fourth daughter of the late
Norman Falkiner, of Noorilim, and Mrs.
Falkiner, of South Yarra, has given the
right kind of answer to Jack de Serville.
Nan Macmeikan is another just-
engaged miss. By marriage she’ll become
Swedish, her fiance being Karl Axelsson,
whose family stronghold is Stockholm.
Mrs. King Lloyd journeyed back to
Geelong after a visit to her parents,
Colonel and Mrs. Murdoch. Sister Enid
Murdoch went, too, the attraction being
the Belcher-Willis wedding.
A. G. Ogilvie and his brother, E. J.
Ogilvie—the former is accompanied by
wife and daughter—chose a ’plane for
their Bass Strait crossing after a holiday
in Melbourne. A.G. is head of the Oppo-
sition in the Speck’s Parliament, and E.J.
is M.H.A. for Barwon.
The Colin Frasers’ Peggy has a rosy
time ahead. She left this week under
mother’s wing for a look at Italy and
the Riviera en route for Easter in Paris,
which city is to put a final veneer upon
her education. Afterwards there are to be
six months in Germany and a period of
travel. Younger sister Dorothy has a
few more years at Catherine’s before
she’s due for finishing abroad. Mrs.
Fraser, Canadian by birth, good Aus-
tralian by adoption, is a vital personality.
In her role of vice-president of the Inter-
national Council of Women she will
attend the council’s conference in Paris.
Miss Fraser’s portrait is by Broothorn.
Melbourne has pleasant memories of
the Stonehavens. Lady Stonehaven
launched daughter Annette (now Mrs.
Michael Mason) at a dance in her house
in Belgrave-square. The Prince of Wales
was one of the deb.’s partners. News
trickles from London of the first season
of the Hon. Ariel Baird, who is her
mother’s chief activity at the moment.
There’s yet another daughter, Ava,
known as “Tubby” during the family’s
five years’ reign in this country.
Sipping coffee and nibbling cream
cakes in the Wattle one stormy afternoon
were two Indian women in national cos-
tume and glamorous jewellery. They
were Mrs. Lilavatti Rallia Ram and her
daughter Rajmohini Rallia Ram. Each
is a good linguist and a 8.A., and this is
their first trip to Australia. The elements
gave them a fierce welcome, but, un-
daunted, they clutched flowing robes, de-
scended the Mongolia’s gangway and
set out to explore Melbourne.
Timothy Coghlan’s lady is visiting the
G.-G. and his lady at Yarralumla. An-
other guest at G.H., Canberra, is Helene
Best. Lady Isaacs always makes her fair-
haired goddaughter very welcome.
Schoolboys and -girls are whooping
with delight at the Vic. Education De-
partment’s new curriculum. Homework
is pruned down to about three nights
a week. In lieu of the evening swot the
young things will be encouraged to
occupy themselves with hobbies. Sub-
jects studied will be chosen as a direct
help to a career—a future man on the
land need not struggle unhappily with
French verbs, and it won’t be necessary
for girls who hope to earn their living
tapping a typewriter to spend years
among the ancient Britons or furrow
their brows with maths. At biennial
exams, pupils will be judged as indivi-
duals, and on their attitude towards their
work, as well as by results.
The smile above the “downy duck-
ling” belongs to Mona Potts, who slipped
into Mimi’s gowns, gloves and shoes
when Iris Kirkwhite sprained an ankle
at a rehearsal of “Gay Divorce.” Miss
Potts is a Sydney girl, and some of the
telegrams pinned round her mirror are
from beach-mates at Bondi and Cronulla:
she’s a good surfer and high-diver. The
new leading lady has grown up in a
family of jolly brothers and sisters. Dur-
ing play-hour at school she ran con-
certs (usually with herself as sole per-
former) which so attracted the youngsters
that school bells rang unanswered. Andre
made the picture.
Adelaide sends a few lines
A cool snap gave range for varied toilettes at
Morphettville. Organdie frocks and large hats
rubbed shoulders with tailored suits and felts.
Wearers of wide-brimmed hats were kept busy
chasing them—a gale howled. The Moulden
lady’s daughter, Deborah Hackett, left the
course with her hat in her hand. Chairman
Whitmore Carr entertained an overflow of
guests at afternoon-tea. Mrs. Frank W. Whyte,-
commandeered to be hostess, was gowned in
navy with a tailored coat collared with skunk
and a small navy hat. The Sowden lady re-
lieved her black crepe frock with large puffed
sleeves of black-and-white plaid, and wore a
large white straw hat. Mrs. Fred Tennant
chose a white flat crepe frock and white toque
with a Lido-blue wool-georgette coat.
Mrs. A. V. E. Richardson and her daughter
Yvonne are staying at Mount Breckan. Just
before their departure Mrs. Richardson enter-
tained a party of overseas visitors-—Prof, and
Mrs. Pearson from India, Baron von Freiburg,
Sir Walter Young and J. B. Cuming, of Oxford.
Mrs. Fred Payne, who has been the guest
of Lady Hore-Ruthven at Government House
for some weeks, has returned to Melbourne.
Rosemary Fleischmann, Lady Hore-Ruthven’s
niece, has been the guest of Dr. and Mrs. F. J.
Douglas at Victor Harbor.
A zephyr from the West:
The summer exodus from Perth is well under
way. Mrs. 'J. J. Holmes, with daughter Mavis
and son Bob, went Strathairding to Colombo;
to the medical conference in the Apple Isle
went Drs. Claude Morlet, Henry Phipps and
Tom Seed with their better halves on holiday
bent; Tynka Salom’s goal is Maoriland, and
Betty Drake Brockman goes to Adelaide to
stay with her aunt, the Moulden lady.
Hon. sec. Ted Keary smiled beatifically on
the jostling roll-up at the Chipper benefit meet-
ing. Goodwood’s lawns wore their brightest
emeralds, morning glory rampaged over the
walls, and most of the regular punters wore
their flimsies. Mrs. Theodore Ambrose was
there, and Mrs. Langlois Lefroy, the latter all
adrip with lapis-lazuli lace. Col. Olden’s wife
wove red, yellow and blue into a neat pattern;
the sisters Hayes backed doubles, Eileen in
mimosa green and Sheila flaunting rainbow
stripes; Hope and Phyl Hope Robertson topped
pastel ninons with matching pancake strav/s;
Orea Moustaka’s blue gaz de soie fluttered in
the breeze; Neva Hocking’s red and orange
blocks were diamond-shaped, and Mrs. Roy
Mitchell zigzagged stripes of tangerine and
lemon.
Effie Stoneman, head of this State’s Psycholo-
gical Clinic until the institution closed down,
returned from Edinburgh with medical degree
attached. Research work at the Jordan Burn
Nerve Hospital, the University Psychological
Clinic and the Royal Infirmary has occupied
her time during the last three years.
Canon P. U. Henn—he who put the Guild-
ford Grammar School chapel on the map—
flew from the roost in England with Mrs. Henn
and chicks Mary and Jean to perch once
more with the Gropers. Fellow birds-of-passage
on the Ormonde were novelist Elinor Mordaunt
with husband R. Bowles, and Mrs. and Peggy
Watson-Williams.
Strings of twinkly rainbow lights were fes-
tooned above tubs of growing hydrangeas when
Shirley Read emerged from sub-debdom at
Albany. Grandma Mrs. Woolcott Walker, with
Mrs. Whitlock as joint-hostess, invited some
scores of locals and folk from the city to mark
the occasion by dancing at The Pines.
Mrs. Claude Crocker slid into cool-looking
white silk crepes, decked her rooms with car-
nations and gladioli and' poured farewell cups
of tea for Mrs. Kerr Pearce, who, with her
Government-House-secretary husband and
daughter Elizabeth, leaves for the Cold Coun-
try by the Orama. Margaret Crocker proffered
delectable edibles in oatmeal marocains.
Corks popped and glasses clinked on the
lawns of the Eric Sandover’s Peppermint Grove
home at their end-of-the-festive-season bottle-
party.
An exhausting round of bride-elect parties is
Angie Bunning’s lot. Betty Hobbs plumed her-
self in magpie trimmings, culled a posy of
crimson roses and handed them to the floral-
muslin-clad guest of honor before shuffling
cards for bridge. Margaret Evans unfurled
tennis net and balls and invited a host of
racquet-wielders to play the game at which
Angie is ranked as an A-grader.
Neville Cullen put a third-finger adornment
on Peggy Sharkey’s left hand before she went
a-holidaying to Singapore.
A note from the Speck:
His Ex. and Lady Clark entertained over a
thousand guests at their first garden party.
Lady Clark wore dark-blue chantilly lace and
georgette and a hat with her favorite fuchsia
tonings. The Hore-Ruthvens were there, taking
a ’busman’s holiday, the lady in beige with
a deep fur-bordered shoulder cape. The day
was chilly, which accounted for the prevalence
of wrap coats. The grounds have been put
in order since the Clarks’ regime began, and
looked most attractive.
Weather was perfect on both days for the
Davis Cup matches. His Ex. and Lady Clark
watched the play on the second day.
The picnic races at Brighton were run under
a summer sun. President John Swan had his
daughters with him, the youngest of whom
presented the Breweries’ trophy to Mrs. L.
Belstead, whose horse won the cup. The dis-
trict turned out in force, and there were car-
loads of folk from town.
The Governor of S.A. and Lady Hore-
Ruthven have been guests of the Clarks at
Government House. There was a dinner-party
in their honor on the last night of the Davis
Cup matches, when Melbourne’s Lud Mayor and
his bride were among the notabilities present.
Peggy Mclntyre (Launceston) was hostess of
a dance at the little hall at Hadspen. Dozens
of bright young things went out from town,
and a fair sprinkling of older ones, too.
Ferntree welcomes its faithful yearly pil-
grims, Mungo MacCullum and his lady. Miss
Gilham, headmistress of the C. of E. Girls’
School, Glenelg, S.A., is also a visitor.
Terence Crisp, accompanied by his artist
friend Geoffry Anderson, has been paying his
home-town a short visit. He dispensed hospi-
tality to a lot of old friends at his mother’s
home, Mortimer-avenue, before leaving for
Melbourne.
Dr. Charlie Bean, who says the end of the
war history which he has been compiling for
years is in sight, is spending a holiday with
his mother at Sandy Bay.
Mabel Ever shed, who left the Speck with the
intention of living with a friend in the Cold
Country, has weakened on that resolution and
taken the job of organist at the Anglican
Church of St. John the Baptist, San Reno,
Northern Italy.
The Speck’s oldest inhabitant is the Rev. C.
F. L’Oste, who reached his 105th milestone
on the ninth and received, among many other
congratulations, a cable from King George. The
old padre is not infirm, and last year took
his first flight in a ’plane.

ALL OVER BRITAIN
RELIEF WORK
By P. B. SLOCIM.
OVER a strip of hillside a half-mile
long and a quarter-mile wide five
hundred men were spread. Some
had picks, some shovels, and not more
than one in ten looked as if he knew (or
wanted to know) how to use the imple-
ment in his hands. They were “emer-
gency-relief workers,” doing “work for
the dole.”
They had cleared off the undergrowth
and were now laying bare slabs and
shelves of rock in readiness for the
jumpermen to prepare them for blasting.
The council under whose direction they
were working hoped that the hillside
would one day be a park. The council’s
ganger hoped so, too ; at the moment,
however, his trouble was to keep five
hundred men busy on a job on which a
hundred would have been too many.
From windows in the houses around
prying eyes were peering whose ratepayer-
owners would presently sit down and
write letters to the council telling how
the relief workers loafed, and how their
(the ratepayers’) money was being wasted,
and asking what the ganger was there
for. So the ganger moved about the hill-
side, exhorting the men to do “something,
anything, for God’s sake, so long as you
look as if you’re working!”
Jim and Ted were together. Judged
by their hatless heads they might have
been father and son —Jim’s scanty hair
was streaked with grey, Ted’s “brush-
back” shone in the sunlight—but until
that morning neither had seen the other.
Jim’s shiny new black shirt looked oddly
out of place with trousers on which
traces of crease still lingered and shoes
that plainly had been at one time a
“smart business” style. Ted’s sockless
feet were encased in sandshoes. A
gaudily-striped silk shirt topped his
patched flannel “bags.”
At starting-time each had grabbed a
tool from the heap outside the time-
keeper’s box and set off down the hill.
Jim had halted near an overhanging
ledge of rock, and presently Ted, finding
the ledge promised some security from
the ganger’s searching eye, had joined
him. Jim would have preferred an older
man beside him, but, having a lad of
his own, he was always eager to hear
the viewpoint of the younger ones.
They had started work. Rather, Jim
had started ; Ted, after lifting and drop-
ping his pick a few times, had flung it
from him in disgust. “They say you
work with a little pick,” he had said,
“and a big one works for you. That’s
the heaviest on the job, so I reckon it s
on strike, and I’m with it.”
Laughing, Jim had taken up the pick
and begun making work for his shovel.
Ted had turned away and filled in time
yarning with friends, throwing stones
in the river and propitiating the assistant-
ganger with offers of a cigarette. But he
had always contrived to be doing some-
thing with pick or shovel when the ganger
came round.
“The greasy cow’ll grab me,” he told
Jim; “I’m an ‘A-scale’.”
Jim had guessed it. An “A-scale” was,
officially, a “single man without de-
pendants.” Five-shillings-and-sixpence-
worth of food being considered sufficient
to keep him alive for a week, nine-and-
fivepence-worth of labor was the portion
allotted him. To this labor few “A-
scales” took kindly. Being mostly young
and irresponsible, the “A-scale” was an
easy mark for the agitator, a megaphone
through which to spread words of dissen-
sion and of strife. He was a thorn in
the side of every ganger, and to the older
men frequently “a dam’ nuisance.”
As the time for the engineer’s visit of
inspection drew near the ganger set out
to ginger up the flagging ones. “It might
interest you chaps to know,” he said,
“that this place was a military camp
during the war. The soldiers must have
lost hundreds of sovereigns here. If you
dig down a couple of inches you might
find some.”
“A nice tale to try and kid a man
with! ” scoffed Ted when the information
reached them.
“It’s not a tale,” said Jim. “There
was a camp here. I put in a couple of
months in it before I went away. This
is the first time I’ve been back since,
and I’ve been trying to remember what
the place looked like. The orderly
room was there, the cookhouse there,
our tent was” He paused and
looked about him. “Cripes! That
ganger was right about sovereigns being
lost. Not hundreds, but some.
“There was a two-up school some-
where about here,” he went on. “It was
below a rock like this one, only higher.
One night there was a hell of an argu-
ment about crook pennies, and the mob'
rushed the ring. I lost three or five
sovereigns—l forget how many—and a
cow tramped on my hand and nearly
broke it when I was scratching for them.
I heard other chaps moaning they’d lost
money, too. But we’d have to be lucky
to find any of it after all these years.
You may depend the lads of the village
loused the place well after the troops
left. -Anyway, fifty-fifty in what we
find, eh?”
“Too right,” said Ted.
But even the lure of gold was not
strong enough to induce Ted to work.
The ganger being away, he sat down in
the shade of the rock. “My old man
wanted to go to the war,” he said, “and
it took my mother and his mother all
they knew to stop him. It was nearly
over before they talked him out of it.
When the soldiers came home he
reckoned he couldn’t stand hearing his
mates talk about what they’d seen and
done; it made him want to go and hide.
I reckon it sent him dippy in the end.
He chucked up his good job and hopped
it to the bush, and a little while after-
wards a tree fell on him and killed him.
So they might as well have let him go
and be killed over there.”
While he was talking Ted had been
dredging from his pockets innumerable
cigarette-ends. . These he broke up, and
put the tobacco from them into a ; tin.
“This is ‘Bumper brand’,” he explained
to Jim. “I keep it for the, nips and bots,
the coves who believe in ‘Use the other
feller’s, and your own’ll last •longer.’ ”
At smoke-oh Jim got to know-more
about Ted. Going late to the fireplace
for his tea .billy, he found Ted the centre
of a threatening group, one of whom was
accusing him of stealing his billy. Jim
looked from the accuser to the accused ;
then he pulled Ted’s sleeve. “I’ve got
enough for two —three if it comes to
that.”
Looking as if he was glad to be rid
of it, Ted handed the billy to the claim-
ant for it.
When they were by themselves Jim
said: “That.wasn’t your.billy, was it?”
“Of course it wasn’t,” laughed Ted. “I
didn’t bring one. My mates told me
there were plenty to pick from round
the fireplace if you got there early. Seems
I wasn’t early enough.”
“How would you like that done to
“l’d say good luck to the bloke that
did it! I wouldn’t squeal. ‘Blast you,
Jack; I’m all right,’ is the only motto
to have these times.” • .
Jim went back to work wondering how
long the holder of such a belief would
have lasted had he expressed it on that
spot 16 or 17 years befoie.
As the morning wore on the green of
the hillside disappeared under mounds
of black soil and scars of red and white
rock. Some, at least, of the men had
heeded the ganger’s exhortation and
“done something.” . , .
At lunch-time, Ted showing no desire
to go near the fireplace, Jim made
enough tea for them both, and they ate
together sitting on a rock. The midday
sun shone full upon them, but a breeze
off the river tempered its heat.
His lunch finished, Ted slid off the
rock, and went to sleep in its shade,
leaving Jim to live again the days when
the hillside was dotted with tents.
Ted woke up grumpy. “Dreamt I was
in the surf,” he said. “Gawd, three and
a half hours more of this work!
It gets me how we stand for it. WorK
for’the dole! The only good thing about
it is that it’ll settle this Gov’ment’s hash
quicker’n anything I know.”
“As for me, it’s the best thing the
Government ever did.”
“Do you mean that, dinkum? Ted
was incredulous.
“I do. The work fills in a bit of a
man’s week, and you draw money that
you can spend as you like. Besides there s
the few bob extra we get when we’re
working.” ,
“I can always pick up a few bob here
and there.” .
“You’re lucky! All I can do is wear
out boot-leather looking for them. I
wish there was more of the work. This’ll
be the first Christmas I haven’t been able
to give the wife a pound to do what she
likes with. I worked for three years for
little more than half wages, and I man-
aged it. No hope this year, I’m afraid."
“Yes, it’s rough on you married
blokes,” said Ted. “It’s the principle
that’s wrong. Take me. I get nine-and-
fivepence for my yacker. That’s three-
and-eleven more than my dole ticket
costs. So the Gov’ment gets six hours
work out of me for three-and-eleven.
It’s our mates’ money that goes to pay
for the dole. The Gov’ment takes it
from those in work to keep us that s out
of work. It doesn’t give us the money
—it’s right there ; some blokes’d booze
it at the first pub, and let their wives
and kids go to blazes—it pays for tucker
for us. That’s fair enough. But if it
wants us to work it should pay us. It’s
like this: The Gov’ment goes to one of
my cobbers and says ‘l’m taking two
bob off you to buy tucker for Ted’;
then it comes to me and says ‘Do some
yakker for this two bob, or you won’t
get it’; and then it laughs to its cobbers
about how it put one over both of us.”
“The discussion is adjourned till four-
thirty,” said the ganger’s . voice behind
them, and they scrambled up.
The ganger turned a frosty eye on
Ted. “I missed you this morning, my
bucko,” he said. “Over among the ‘A-
scales,’ you. There’s, a pretty red barrow
waiting for: you. I love watching you
and your cobbers sweat.”
“Leave him with me, boss. I’ll keep
him at it,” said Jim without knowing
why he said it.
The ganger looked him up and down.
“All right, old ’un,” he said; “the
barrow’s there if he jibs.”
Ted didn’t jib. He had less to distract
him now, for the men who had been
near them in the morning had moved
away, of their own. volition, or at the
behest of the ganger, and he and Jim
were by themselves; and maybe the
threat of duty with a wheelbarrow helped
him. .
When all the available rock in their
vicinity had been bared, Jim, finding his
shovel’ bite deeply into the sandy soil,
dug on aimlessly, until he was standing
waist-deep in a hole below the shelf of
rock. For a while Ted watched him
idly; then, having exchanged his pick
for a shovel whose owner had put it
down while he debated the merits of
Douglas Credit, he set about clearing
away the soil Jim'shovelled out.
For a long time they worked in silence,
Jim digging and lifting, Ted tipping the
dirt where fancy led him.
Suddenly . Jim plucked an object from
the bottom of the hole and rubbed it on
his trousers. “Hooray!” he exclaimed.
“A sovereign, Ted. A real sovereign.
We’ll sell it on the way home, and go
fifty-fifty.”
“No, I’m damned if we will!” said
Ted so sharply that Jim looked round.
“What’s up?” Jim asked.
“I found three of those an hour ago
and I’ve been trying ever since to make
myself give you one.”
Jim. grinned. “Don’t blame yourself,
old son,” he said. “You thought before
you spoke; I didn’t. Perhaps if I’d
thought first and spoken afterwards a
bit more about things like that I’d be
better off to-day. However”
Ted was holding out two sovereigns.
“Jim,” he said, “I want you to take
these. Give the - missus one —you said
you always give her a pound for Christ-
mas ; the other’s for your kids. You’ve
got the one you found, and I’ve got one.
So we’re all set.”
Jim shook his head. “Half-and-half,
we said.”
Ted’s eyes glistened. “I want you to
take them,” he said huskily, “for —for
showing me what a —a dinkum bloke is.”
Again Jim shook his head.
“Will this way suit you then?” Ted
pulled out a penny, spun it high and,
when it fell, put his foot on it. “Heads
you take them; tails you don’t.”
Jim nodded.
. Ted uncovered the penny. Heads it
was.
Keluctantly Jim took the sovereigns.
When he turned away to tie them in his
handkerchief, Ted picked up the penny
and disgustedly flung it into the river.
. “So it’s a Christmas-relief job pro-
perly, Mary,” said Jim to his wife that
night when he had told her the story.
“Mind, only two of those sovereigns are
yours. I’ll give the other one back to
that young chap when we start work
after the holidays. He’ll probably be
glad of it then.”
; “I don’t understand yet,” said Mary.
“The sight of real money has flustered
me. You saw them first, you said”
“Yes. In fact, two were on one shove!
of dirt I threw down near him.”
“Supposing he hadn’t said anything
about them?”
“I chanced that. Anyway, I’d lost ’em
before—-or some like ’em ; a second time
.wouldn’t have mattered. I wanted F
see what the future Digger was made of.
In spite of all his red-ragger talk he came
up to the scratch. Why, the young rip
actually fixed it so that I couldn’t lose
the toss! He tossed with a double-
headed penny he’d found with the
sovereigns. You’d have laughed to see
the way he pounced on it and threw it
into the river when he thought I wasn’t
looking.”


Out of the Past.
THE IMMIGRANTS.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
IN January, 1838, two vessels came
through Bass Strait together, and were
in sight of one another all the way up
the coast of New South Wales. The
barque Fortunatus, male and female
immigrants, passed between Sydney
Heads two hours earlier than the brig
Tobias, male convicts —a fact which, in
that strange fashion facts have of arrang-
ing their effects, very curiously affected
the fortunes of two young men bearing
the same name and of about the same
age who, as far as either knew, were not
related.
The free immigrant, John Sylvester,
from the village of Bourne End, in Bucks,
met with disaster owing to the Fortunatus
entering Port Jackson first, whilst the
later arrival of the Tobias did, as he sup-
posed, all the good in the world to the
prisoner John Sylvester, from Rochester,
in Kent.
In 1838, Sydney was not such a goodly
city as it is to-day but it was not a bad
place, either. In all its existence, since
Commodore Phillip landed in the Cove,
it has had charm. Even in its worst
days of misery and famine there was
something about the place that did not
admit of loss of hope and courage, that
inspired to better things.
To John Sylvester, the free, Sydney
seemed to hold out promise of high hope
—to John Sylvester, the felon, it gave no
reason for despair. It could have done
no better for either of them.
In all documents having to do with
prisoners of the Crown in New South
Wales and Van Diemen’s Land in the
early days, it was customary to identify
any person by the name of the ship which
had transported him or her to Australia.
The arrangement had obvious conveni-
ences, and it will be as useful in telling
this tale.
John Fortunatus Sylvester came ashore
just as the brig Tobias was dropping her
anchor off the Cove, and immediately-
sought for, and found, the business estab-
lishment of Mr. Josiah Turnbull. Mr.
Turnbull owned Turnbull’s Flour Mill it
the foot of Druitt-street, Turnbull’s
Brewery at Parramatta, and several pros-
perous sheep and cattle stations in the
districts of Wellington Valley, the Hunter
River, New England and Port Phillip. To
him Fortunatus had a letter from the
Vicar of Bourne End, who had been a
schoolfellow of Mr. Turnbull’s at Rugby.
No one could have come to the colony
better equipped in the matter of introduc-
tions. He had but to wait five minutes
before being shown into Mr. Turnbull’s
private office in the Pitt-street counting-
house.
“Glad to see you, Mr. Sylvester,” said
Josiah, a portly gentleman with a pleasant
ruddy face and sharp eyes. “And how
is my old friend, Tom Butler? He speaks
very highly of you here. Pray sit down.”
They talked for nearly an hour, during
which space of time Mr. Turnbull turned
Fortunatus inside out, learned all about
his birth, his schooling, his experience of
stock gathered on his father’s farm in the
Thames Valley, his personal ambitions
and tastes, and how much money he had
—without in the least giving the latter
any notion that he was going through any
such process of examination. Then he
pronounced judgment.
“Well, well. Excellent! So you have
a thousand pounds, which you would
like to leave in my hands whilst you gain
some experience of the country. Good.
Delighted to act as your banker. You
are wise, I think. Very wise. So many
people come here with a notion they’ve
only got to squat down on the country,
and the country’ll do all that’s necessary
for their welfare. So it will —generally—if
they take the trouble to make its acquaint-
ance. But they don’t often. So they go
broke, and depart with the idea that it’s
the Devil’s own land. But it’s nothing
of the sort, Sylvester, my boy—nothing
of the sort. Look what it’s done for old
Jos Turnbull. Hadn’t £lOOO when I
landed here in Governor Macquarie’s
time —hardly a tenth of it. Got a dollar
or two now, though.”
He leaned back in his chair, grinning
good-humoredly, whilst Fortunatus mur-
mured polite appreciation of his mentor’s
qualifications as such. Mr. Turnbull con-
tinued :
“Yes. Now, I’ll tell you what I’ll do
for you. I’ll send you up to one of
my stations for six months—or as long
as you like to stay there—so that you
may get to know Australia. Colonial ex-
perience, we call it here. You must have
it, Sylvester, before you can hope to make
your little heap of dollars out of the
country. You’ll get no pay, and you’ll
have to work hard, but your £l.OOO will
be earning interest, and ’twill cost you
nothing. When you’re ready to start on
your own account—that is, of course, if
you’ve shaped as well as I’d be willing to
wager you will —maybe Josiah Turnbull
and Co. will let you have an advance
sufficient to give you a chance of making
that start with reasonable prospect of
success.
Fortunatus was all gratitude.
“It’s a pleasure to serve any fellow who
comes to me with such a letter as you’ve
brought from dear Tom Butler. Come
and dine with me this evening. Five
o’clock. Woolloomooloo. Queer name,
hey? Just below the new gaol they’re
building—they call the hill Darlinghurst
now—but I prefer the old name. Any
one’ll tell you how to get to Jos Turn-
bull’s. Five o’clock. Good luck to you,
my boy.”
John Tobias Sylvester was duly
marched ashore from the transport and
paraded at the Hyde Park prisoners’ bar-
racks, where one or two employers from
the interior were waiting to select convict
labor. It was his fortune to be picked out
by Captain William Duclos, of St.
Michael’s Hill, on the Upper Hunter. Had
he come ashore two hours earlier, he
would have missed this doubtful privilege,
since the picking and choosing would have
been over before Captain Duclos had
arrived in Sydney from Bathurst, where
he had been inspecting cattle with a view
to purchase.
* * * *
Five months later, Fortunatus Sylvester
was sitting on the verandah of Mr.
Dangar’s Golden Fleece Inn at Scone,
in the Upper Hunter district, in
company with Mr. Peter Geohagan—pro-
nounced “Gaggin”—Superintendent of
Josiah Turnbull’s station on the Dart-
brook, Oxley Vale. Brown and sinewy
and alert he had become since he pre-
sented his letter to “old Jos” in the Pitt-
street office. The fresh complexion and
semi-plumpness characteristic of the
“Johnny-come-lately” had departed from
him. He wore his cabbage-tree hat a
little to one side, had on tight cord
riding-breeches, was booted and spurred,
and sported a black silk handkerchief
about his throat that set off his red
flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up
above his tanned forearms.
Altogether he looked a happy, healthy
youth. He had not that air of effi-
cient swagger that bespoke the native-
born, but he was a very well-acclimatised
young Englishman of the sort that is well
pleased to think he looks like an Austra-
lian, and is conscious of the fact that
he does his fancy no disgrace. He
smoked an after-dinner pipe, whilst his
companion chewed and spat promiscu-
ously over the outer edge of the verandah.
Geohagan had on a blue peajacket,
somewhat dingy moleskins and a battered
top-hat that had obviously seen better
days. His great gnarled hands rested on
his knees, and he stooped forward a little,
as he peered out into the roadway beyond
the two-rail fence. He turned for a
moment to stare at his companion.
“Look who’s cornin’!”
Fortunatus, who had been day-dream-
ing, took his pipe from his mouth.
“Who’s coming? Where?”
“There —in the road. ’Tis th’ livin’
spit an’ image of y’self, Johnny.”
He pointed to a young man who had
halted, and was himself staring in be-
wilderment at the pair on the verandah.
John Fortunatus stood up to look, and he
and his very double, in all save the cloth-
ing that they wore, looked each other
over in mutual amazement.
The man in the road wore the rough
and tattered clothing that classified him
unmistakably as being a “Government
man” in assigned service. Save that it
wore a furtive scowl. John Fortunatus
could have sworn that he looked into
the face that he had regarded in the
mirror that morning, when he had shaved
himself in his bedroom out at Oxley Vale.
“Come in here, me man,” said Geo-
hagan, “an’ let’s luk at ye! ”
“Who be you, maester?” asked the
man outside the fence.
“I’ll show ye who I am, if ye don’t
move y’silfj pris’ner. I’m Mister Peter
Geohagan, I’d ha’ ye for to know —Jus-
tice o’ the Peace, an’ Super, out at Oxley
Vale. Step up here, now, an’ none o’ y’r
shinnanikin’.”
Sulkily, the young man got through the
fence and stood before the magistrate—
and his own living image.
The two young men—the one free,
happy and contented, the other an Eng-
lish slave of such a sort as only Virginia,
Maryland and Australia have known —
stared at one another with an astonish-
ment that grew with every moment. Mr.
Geohagan glared at both of them, in a
puzzled bewilderment that outdid their
own. Presently he sat down, motioning
to Fortunatus to do likewise. Then he
proceeded to examine the convict.
“What’s y’r name an’ ship, an’ where
do ye belong?”
“John Sylvester, Tobias, seven years,
Maidstone Assizes, 1837. In assigned ser-
vice—Cap’n Duclos—St. Michael’s.”
“Howly Ghost, an’ th’ names is th’
same, too. Did iver man see or hear o’
such a thing!”
For a little while longer, none of the
three spoke. Then Mr. Geohagan again.
“Johnny,” he said to Fortunatus, “what
make ye of this? Is this mahn y’r twin
brother, or what? Ask him who he is.
’Tis dramin’ or drunk we surely must
be!”
Fortunatus spoke, gently and pityingly.
“Where d’ye come from, lad —at home,
I mean?”
“From Rochester, in Kent, y’r honor.”
“Ha’ ye relations there, Johnny?” asked
Mr. Geohagan.
“None that I know of, Peter,” answered
Fortunatus, shaking his head. “All my
people are Buckinghamshire—my own lot
at Bourne End, some at High Wycombe,
some near Penn. None in Kent that we
know of.”
“Then, ’tis throwbacks ye must be, to
some common sthock these hundreds o’
years back. ’Tis well known enough in
sheep- an’ horse-breedin’. Glory be!
Pris’ner,” he spoke as one having
authority—“what do ye here in Scone?
Show me y’r pass.”
John Tobias smiled bitterly, and drew
a folded paper from the pocket of his
jacket, which he handed to Mr. Geo-
hagan. The latter read it aloud.
“To the Bench of Magistrates, Scone.
Kindly give bearer, John Sylvester, per
Tobias, fifty lashes. Insolence. And
oblige, yours to command, William
Duclos, J.P., St. Michael’s Hill.”
“Oho —so that’s th’ pass ye have, is
it?” He thought for a few moments.
“Ha’ ye a pencil, Johnny?”
Fortunatus handed him one, and Mr.
Geohagan wrote a few words across the
paper, and passed it back to John Tobias.
“D’ye see what I’ve writ, pris’ner? Ye
may take it back to Billy Duclos. ‘Pris’ner
acquitted—insufficient evidence.’ ’Tis
lucky for you, me mahn, I’m th’ on’y
magistrate in attendance to-day. And
now be off wi’ ye—back to St. Michael’s.”
Tobias saluted, too astounded even to
mutter his thanks for this unprecedented
mercy, and departed through the fence.
For a moment he paused, and turned to
look at his double. Then he walked away
hastily, muttering to himself.
“Johnny,” said Mr. Geohagan,
solemnly shaking his head, “I misdoubt
I’ve done an unneighborly thing to Cap-
tain Duclos, but he may go to H—l!
I’m not a-goin’ for to flog y’r livin’
image.”
* * $ *
When Tobias Sylvester returned to St.
Michael’s, unflogged, Duclos was furious.
“Very well, Mr. McNabb,” he said
to his overseer, who had informed him
of the virgin state of Tobias Sylvester’s
back, “we’ll send him into Muswell-
brook to-morrow, with a request for
seventy-five. I’ll show him he can’t fail
to salute me with impunity.”
So, on the following day, John Tobias
was sent tramping into Muswellbrook
with another cheque for fifty lashes, plus
twenty-five for interest.
But he never reached there. Instead
of walking down the Hunter to be flogged
he turned up the Rouchel Brook, into
the ranges, and such freedom from
tyranny as might be afforded by the pro-
fession of bushranging.
And so we find him, in the dusk of a
September evening, lurking in the tall
timber by the Great Northern Road, two
miles above Chain-o’-Ponds, a Tower
musket in his hands, awaiting whom he
might waylay.
Above the tall ironbarks opposite his
hiding-place, the sky was a deep crimson,
against which the sombre foliage of the
silent forest stood out blackly. There
was but little light in the lane that ran
between the trees, but quite sufficient for
John Tobias to make certain that he did
not miss his mark at a range of five
yards, when a solitary horseman came
jogging down the road, evidently making
for the wayside inn at Chain-o’-Ponds.
Tobias did not challenge his victim
with the usual “Bail up!” A person to
whom he had extended this courtesy three
days before had fired at him, slain his
horse, and then chased him for two miles
through the bush. It was that redoubtable
Tartar Captain Edward Denny Day,
Police Magistrate at Maitland, who, a
little over two years afterwards was to
capture the Jewboy Gang at Doughboy
Hollow, above Murrurundi.
He waited until the unsuspecting
traveller was directly opposite the tree
behind which he hid, and against whose
rough trunk he steadied the barrel of his
musket. There was a flash and a roar
when he pulled the trigger—and he saw
his man throw up his hands, and topple
out of the saddle on the offside. The
weary horse stood stock still, with low-
ered head, whilst his rider lay motionless
on his back in the roadway.
Tobias shivered for a moment—he had
never killed a man before—and then ran
to secure the horse, which he fastened by
the reins to a sapling. Coming back, he
stooped over the body, and peered closely
into the dead man’s face. There was just
light enough to distinguish the features,
“Oh, my God,” he cried, “ ’tis the other
John Sylvester!”
* * * *
Mr. Josiah Turnbull, told his wife—
whose miniature on ivory is in the
Mitchell Library—of his disappointment.
“You know, my dear, I was never so
mistaken in my life. I’d have wagered
1000 guineas that young Sylvester would
have turned out well here. And I thought
he ba d, from Peter Geohagan’s account
of him up there at Oxley Vale. But he
ba 4 deteriorated incredibly. When he
arrived in the colony I was immensely
struck with the young fellow. Frank,
open, manly, bright and intelligent. You
saw him for yourself, when he dined
here. When he came to see me last week,
h e seemed utterly changed. Had I not
know him for the same person, I could
have sworn that someone was imper-
sonatmg John Sylvester. He’s become a
sullen, frightened-looking fellow, always
looking behind as if a constable were after
him. And disgusted with the colony, he
said wanted to get away at once, in the
first ship. Would have his £lOOO, and
G ear out. He’d injured his right hand—
twas , ab * ie d up in bandages—and
c °uldn t write a receipt, but he showed
JJie mine, and I gave it to him. He’d
been keeping a diary up on the Dart-
i ,r ® ok: ’ which he let me look at, and ’twas
£U" 9* . e happiest remarks concerning
bl s situation and prospects. ’Tis inex-
phcable, such a change in any human
being, unless it be the symptom of sortie
cental disorder. Ah, that’s what I fear
*t must be. But the colony’s well-rid of
SU^L a fehow as he’s become.”
t “ e s &pue then?” asked Mrs. Josiah.
Gone, replied her lord. “He sailed
tor London to-day, in the Peterborough.”
To a Dead Love.
The lips that hungry Death has kissed,
Ah, shall they keep another tryst?
When all brave hopes and braver fears
Lie ’neath the juggernaut of years,
Shall blood that leapt at thy caress
Mirror the stars in loneliness,
Or pulse in prouder veins than these
To strange immortal cadences?
Then under desert sun or shade
Of dank moon-dappled ambuscade,
I’d stand alone and unafraid.
The lips that hungry Death has kissed,
Ah, shall they keep another, tryst?
MAORILAND.

Native Rose.
Sweatheart of the bush, the wild rose quivers
With joy of summer in her bower of fern,
Drinking the coolness of the creeks and rivers
From beds of moss round many a reedy
turn.
Where the trees lave their roots her beauty
lingers—
Petals of gossamer, like matched rose pearls—
Thrilling the hearts, tempting the envious
fingers,
Stirring the jealousy of fair young girls.
Dear debutante at dances of the flowers,
Her fragrance might be that of Helen’s hair:
Light as the scent after midsummer showers,
Essence of song that drifts along the air.
In her flushed cheeks the little rose discloses
Color more delicate than we have seen
Even in orchids or the stately roses
Of gardens where the lawns are trim and
green.
Treasure of wattle scattered in the valleys
Seek if you will, and take the damask-white
Daisies, that hide away where water sallies
Out of the hills —let these be my delight:
Roses, wild native roses, fresh and simple,
Kissed by the morning sun and bathed in
dew,
Each like a princess in a pale-pink wimple,
Raising her head to blow a kiss to you.
N.s.w.

Problem in Vanity.
Let beauty be approved
Wherein my pleasure is:
Now in my looking-glass
1 find not much amiss.
Your human loveliness,
Virtue or valiant deed
Could not create in me
A vessel for your need,
Did you not offer more—
You with a soul to spend,
Of beauty much aware.
To beauty bosom friend.
All mellow harmonies
In sound or sight or touch
Find you responding, wise—
Then I, you love so much
Am I not very sure
Of beauty in my kind?
Or am I only vain
In love, as you are blind?

The Wonderful Day.
BY W. CHARNLEY.
IN all the years that saw Jimmy Rob-
son grow from boyhood to manhood
there was one day in his memory that
stood put like a milepost. A wonderful
day.
It began at breakfast time.
His father had been worried and down-
cast for weeks previously, but on this
particular morning he had brightened up.
“Your ninth birthday, Jimmy. And
we’ll go out and have a day together;
a whole day.”
Where would they go? “The museum,
dad,” said Jimmy. So to the museum
they went.
First, they journeyed into town in a
tram, which was commonplace enough.
This brought them to crowded streets,
where Jimmy was glad to keep touch
with his father’s hand.
Then over a wide railway bridge,
where clanking locomotives puffed up
smoke and steam as they ran beneath.
Then came a big dark block of build-
ings. “The law courts,” his father said.
On the steps at the main door of the
law courts Jimmy noticed a group of big,
severe-looking men who seemed to look
sharply at him and his father. He fan-
cied that one of them gave a curt nod.
“That man seemed to know you, dad,”
he remarked when they had got past.
“Who is he?”
His father showed a ghost of a smile.
“He’s a detective, boy. I suppose he
knows nearly everybody.”
“Queer to be a detective and know
nearly everybody,” Jimmy mused.
Then they came to the museum.
How many treasures from all the world
were stored up in that place! Far more
than one could possibly see in a day. And
how clever his father was to know so
much about them! There seemed to be
nothing that he did not know ; no matter
how avidly Jimmy questioned he could
supply an answer.
There was the mummy, dead and pre-
served these three thousand years ; his
father could explain all about that. And
the giant albatross which hung with wide-,
spread wings from the ceiling of the bird
room ; was that the albatross which the
Ancient Mariner shot, and which his
shipmates hung round his neck?
Not quite the same, his father ex-
plained ; but a member of the family.
'then there were skeletons of animals,
and skeletons of men. And fossils of
strange beasts that had lived a million
years ago; beautiful mother-of-pearl
shells lifted from the bed of the sea ;
stuffed animals and birds, real as life ;
meteorites which had fallen from the slcy,
bright shooting stars that one sometimes
saw at night; cases of brilliant-winged
butterflies and weird insects ; chain armor
such as knights wore; spinning-wheels
that might have belonged to the Lady of
Shalott; guns and pistols ; cannons ; the
model of a goldmine ; nuggets of gold ;
sharks ; the bones of a whale ; a thou-
sand other things; ten thousand—far
too many to see properly in one day.
For dinner they went to a restaurant
where Jimmy, a trifle shy, tasted the
novel experience of dining in public. His
father gave him the choice of the menu.
“Your birthday dinner, Jimmy,” he said
with a wistful smile.
After dinner they went back to the
museum and found a vast hall where
stood tall white models of the statuary ot
ancient Greece and Rome, and even of
Babylon. Then upstairs to the gallery,
where there were so many pictures that
one could hardly remember them all.
Queer pictures some of them were, be-
yond his boyish understanding. But many
were homely, and these he liked best.
“Down on His Luck” was one —an old
sundowner with a very lean swag kind-
ling a tiny fire in a lonely bush glade.
Down on his Luck! Jimmy thought the
old man looked it.
After the art gallery they visited the
library. Jimmy loved books, and the sight
of near half a million volumes dazzled
him like Ali Baba’s cave. Such a vast-
ness of books —and to be able to pick
any one you liked and sit down and read
it! He would come here often when
he grew up.
Up winding stairs he and his father
climbed, right to the high dome of the
building, where one could look down
somewhat giddily to the floor and the
reading desks below. It was a wonderful
sight. And while they were up there it
grew dark, and an attendant switched on
the lights: clusters of frosted incandes-
cents which lit the vast hall like daylight.
After tea in the same restaurant they
went to the pictures. Jimmy liked these,
though they weren’t nearly as good as the
museum and the library.
His father put him to bed. Usually
it was Aunt Mary who smoothed his
pillow and gave him a final tuck-in, but
on this night of nights it was dad. His
father kissed him several times—seeming,
Jimmy thought, strangely reluctant to
leave him.
“I’m going away in the morning,
Jimmy, and it will be a long time before
you see me again.” His father’s voice
had a queer thick note in-it.
“So good night and good-bye, lad.
Now go to sleep.”
But Jimmy couldn’t sleep. How could
he after a day so crowded with wonders?
The news that his father was going away
in the morning also added to his excite-
ment. His brain went round and round
on wheels, and though he closed his eyes
tight he lay wide-awake thinking.
In a near-by room his father and Aunt
Mary began talking. Jimmy listened.
“Thank God, anyway, I’ve been able
to give the boy one last day. We’ve had
a wonderful time together.”
Aunt Mary murmured something.
“You will never need to tell him,” his
father continued. “Just say I’ve gone
away, which will be true, and as the years
pass just say I’m dead; that will be
true also. No, there isn’t the ghost of a
chance that things will come out as you
hope ; they’ve got me this time. There’ll
be enough left out of the wreck to rear
the boy: money that belonged to his
mother. Not much, but sufficient.”
Aunt Mary again murmured some-
thing.
Then sleep descended on Jimmy’s boy-
ish brain and next thing it was morning.
With a final kiss, which the child was
almost too drowsy to return, his father
went.
He never came back.
In the years that followed Jimmy
puzzled greatly. “Where did father go
to, and why did he expect to die?”
Father had gone to New Guinea, his
aunt explained. A wild country, where
anything might happen. _
With this explanation Jimmy’s ideal
of his father grew. New Guinea! Ex-
ploration ; cannibals ; gold. What stories
dad would have to tell if ever he came
back! But he never came back, and
Jimmy was forced to feed his imagination
on memories. And most of all he dwelt
on that last wonderful day.
Birthdays came and passed, but never
was one of them like that. Nor could he
renew his acquaintance with the museum
itself, for now he and Aunt Mary lived
in the country —they had shifted there
the week after his father’s departure. But
there was little that he forgot.
When Jimmy was getting on towards
fifteen, his aunt seemed to take on a new
attitude: she seemed to move around with
an air of suspense and, expectation as
waiting for someone. A click of the gate
latch or a man’s heavy tread made her
tremble. Once, on the eve of Jimmy s
birthday, she breathed a hope.
“Your father, Jimmy, may be coming
back soon ; perhaps on your birthday.”
But he failed to come, though Jimmy
watched and hoped all day long. “Per-
haps he is dead,” he said when night
came.
His aunt nodded. “Perhaps.”
“Perhaps! ” grew into certainty as other
years passed away. A man who never
comes back must surely be dead.
Still the thought of his father’s death
puzzled the boy. Why hadn’t he written,
sent some last message? Perhaps he
hadn’t thought it necessary when he
knew so well that he was going away to
die. He had bidden them all good-bye;
given him, Jimmy, that last wonderful
day and gone. That apparently had been
enough. .
So that last day stood as a milestone in
Jimmy’s life: it and his wonderful father.
Jimmy grew up clever. From the little
country school he won scholarships which
carried him back to the city. From the
high school there he won entrance to
the University. And so, by the eager
work of his brain, he made his way
upwards. To qualify in physical science
was his ambition, and at twenty he re-
ceived his first appointment —as an assist-
ant analytical chemist to a mining com-
pany four hundred miles away.
He had been away a year when quite
suddenly he was called back. Aunt Mary
was dead.
She had remained behind when he went
to take up his new position, living alone
in the little house which she had bought
when they returned to the city.
Jimmy was sole mourner at her funeral,
and after the earth had closed over her
he returned to the tiny home and sat a
while among the familiar things. His
father’s eldest sister! All her goods and

||l HOKITIKA 186 -
Ŕ
At Hokitika (N. Z.) in 1864
Sensational gold discoveries were made on the
West Coast of New Zealand in the 'sixties. In 1864
the yield of gold from that area exceeded £2,000,000.
At the time of the Hokitika rush in that year, the
local representative of the Bank of New South
Wales wrote:
"The majority of miners having left the Green-
stone for the rush, I, of course, followed the
crowd . . . could not manage to get a horse so
started on foot. . . . Last night I walked from
Teremakau after dark (10 miles) with the gold
on my shoulders."
This is typical of the Bank's pioneering service
throughout Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific
Islands.
The Bank of New South Wales has provided bank-
ing facilities in Hokitika for nearly seventy years.
Throughout the rise and decline of goldmining and
the subsequent development of sawmilling, now
the principal industry, the Bank has co-operated in
every possible way in the progress of the district.

furniture were there just as she had left
them. He needed only to close his eyes
to see her moving about, or even sitting,
as she had often done of an evening,
patiently answering his persistent ques-
tions about his father. Dear old aunt,
the only mother he had known! And now
that she was gone he was all alone in the
world.
Presently, to relieve his thoughts, he
began to hunt around from room to
room, peering into boxes and chests-of-
drawers which in his boyhood days had
been forbidden ground.
His aunt’s personality clung to every-
thing. What strange things, queer odds
and ends, she had accumulated! He began
to sort them out, laying aside such things
as he might wish to keep for remem-
brance. Old letters; he put them aside.
Then he came on a faded newspaper.
No harm in glancing at that.
His eye caught a headline and he felt
as if his brain had been seared by flame.
JAMES ROBSON FOUND GUILTY.
His eyes flew to the bottom of the
column.
“Seven years’ imprisonment, with hard
labor.”
For a minute he stood stunned. The
father he had worshipped, a criminal!
Regaining a grip of realities, he care-
fully read the account of the trial
through. It was conclusive: Embezzle-
ment ; forgery; two counts.
He looked at the date of the paper.
Just two days after his ninth birthday.
For a long time he stood gazing at
nothing, thinking. So that was what his
father had meant about going away—
and dying. Prison! And on that last
day they had spent together, that wonder-
ful day, his father had known all the
time what awaited him on the morrow.
No wonder he had hurried past the law
courts; no wonder the detectives had
looked sharply at them and one had
nodded. And how splendidly his father
had borne it all, giving his last day of
freedom to his son!
What his father had done mattered
nothing. Men did as much, and worse,
every day. He had paid for it. And
he had never come back ; never returned
to cast the shadow of his shame upon his
son. He had gone to serve his sentence
and die.
But was he dead? The bundles of old
letters might hold the answer to that
question.
With no thought of sacrilege now,
Jimmy began to sort them out.
“I am coming out soon,” the last
one said, “but I will not come near you.
I am glad the boy does so well. En-
courage him to think of me as dead —
he will never get on in the world if men
know he has a gaolbird for a father.”
Till long after midnight Jimmy sat
reading the tragedy of his father’s life ;
reading the brief account of the trial
through and through ; reading and re-
reading those sad prison letters ; walk-
ing again hand-in-hand with his father
when he had the foredoom of all these
things upon him. And rising even higher
than the courage of that wonderful day
was the greatness of his father’s sacrifice.
In the morning when he woke Jimmy
had a queer desire. Once more he would
walk with his father, a child again,
through the streets, through the great
museum, visiting all the scenes of that day
—the day when his father to him had
been the greatest man in all the world.
The door of the museum yawned invit-
ingly when he reached it. Expectantly he
stepped inside; could he recapture the
glamor of that day? The mummy was
still there, and the albatross, and the
pearlshells, and the spinning-wheels, and
the skeleton c?f the whale—all the ten
thousand things as he had seen them
before.
But there was a note of sadness in
them now. He was no longer the eager
boy, asking never-ending questions, nor
could the ghost that walked beside him
give answer if he did. Nor were his feet
impatient as they had been, itching to
get on to the next exhibit when older
eyes found interest in a quartz crystal or
the malformation of a long-buried skull.
There was no life in the place, only dead
things; and the dead walked beside him.
He began to wish he had not come.
Still he felt that he must see it all,
revisit every scene and then depart, clos-
ing the book of memory behind him.
Through the great hall of statuary he
wandered, then up the wide staircase to
the art gallery. Most of the old pictures
were still there, and with them many
new ones. His manhood’s taste found
more interest in them now. From canvas
to canvas he moved, taking pleasure in
tone and figure and scene. Then he re-
membered “Down on His Luck.” How
did that measure up to his new standard
of judgment? There it was, in that far
corner. The old place.
Suddenly he stopped. A man was
leaning against the rail, gazing at the
picture and apparently lost in thought.
Shabby, yet clean, the man was: bowed,
though not so much with age, for his
hair, was barely tinged with grey. Where
had Jimmy seen him before?
Aunt Mary! This man resembled her.
His mind leaped back over the years.
Could he ever forget? To-day was his
twenty-first birthday ; had his father come
back, as he himself had come, to live
again in spirit that last wonderful day?
The man was absorbed in dreams and
did not hear him approach. Jimmy
touched him on the arm. “Dad,” he
said. ,
Startled, his father looked up ; went
pale ; then made to turn away.
But Jimmy was not to be denied.
“Dad!” he repeated, taking him gently
by the arm.
The Fourth Trap.
BY CHAS. H. SHAW.
IN an effort to catch a dingo that had
come further south than usual, a rouse-
about set four rabbit traps, wired to-
gether and to the butt of a tree, round a
ewe that had died lambing
The blue cattle-dog with the black
spots, deserted by an owner who had in-
dulged in a drinking bout and dis-
appeared, spent three days on the streets
of the unfamiliar town and then set off
for the north. He had come down from
the Cooper on the cattle train with his
owner, and all he could do was to attempt
to go back. He went north guided by his
instinct. ,
He was passing along a road the next
night when the breeze brought the smell
of dead meat to his hunger-sharpened
nose. Bluey turned up the slope in the
darkness and trotted among the stunted
trees, running down the smell. He
slavered a little at sight of the dead ewe,
lurched forward, and was trapped. ’
Panic-stricken, he threw himself side-
ways, and another trap snapped and held.
The dog ki-yied with shock and further
panic and, in a mad excess of desperation,
tried to leap from the steel jaws. He scat-
tered tiny sticks and gravel in his throes
and pulled one trap slightly awry. But
his struggles were vain and, when the
third trap snapped and held,’ Bluey was
fast by both front paws and one hind
paw, lying on his side in the dust, pant-
mg and helpless and in great fear.
He stared up at the stars with
anguished eyes and howled in short cries
of mingled pain and terror.
After a time he began to struggle again.
He heaved and strained until his sinewy
body arched itself; he growled and bit
savagely at the trans; presently he was
exhausted and still.*
These periods of struggle and quiet
ntinued at irregular intervals until the
time came when he lay, exhausted and
covered with dust, in a semi-stupor. At
times his body twitched, and once his
ears pricked and his tail wagged as he
dreamed that he was heeling a mob
across a ford while a well-known voice
issued commands. But the voice and the
vision faded away on the dark slope and,
when he tried to rise and follow, his
terror came back as the traps held him
fast. He tried to bark, but his throat
seemed cracked and burning. A black
cloud came over the stars. Bluey whim-
pered slightly as his worn body relaxed.
The high stars in the east were losing
a little of their brightness when the
trapped dog stirred. His delicate nostrils
analysed the air; he turned his head and
pricked his ears ; a faint murmur started
deep down in his parched throat. A
shape stood in the gloom a few feet away,
and Bluey knew it stared at him. His
nose told him that it was a dingo, one of
those slinking outlaws of his tribe, many
of which he had pulled down and wor-
ried to death on the Cooper.
He growled louder and the shape van-
ished. It reappeared, a little to the right
of its former position and a little nearer,
evidently trying to discover why the blue
dog lay on his side —why he did not rush.
Again Bluey growled, but this time the
dingo merely shifted his position a little
nearer, prick-eared with curiosity.
All the cattle-dog’s instincts urged
Bluey up and to war, but the traps held
him fast and he became almost crazed
with impotence, struggling fiercely and
growling menacingly, keeping his dust-
caked eyes on the circling dingo.
The dingo was obviously puzzled by
the cattle-dog’s inability to move. Soon,
emboldened, it was close to the captive’s
tail With a mighty effort Bluey heaved

himself partly upright, his fangs gleam-
ing and his eyes glaring in the faint dawn-
light. The dingo jumped back and
snarled. Bluey collapsed again. The
dingo gave a fiercer snarl and, all its
sneaking killer instincts stirred by the
helplessness of the enemy, began to
advance again, horrid purpose in its evil,
slinking bearing.
Bluey quivered. He knew he was at
the dingo’s mercy, held as he was by the
cold things that had sprung from the earth
to grip his paws in fangs of steel that
never tired, never eased their pressure.
He had not encountered such things on
the Cooper; they were utterly foreign to
him; but some blind instinct told him
that they were man-made. Yet the men
he knew did not do such things to their
dogs. The dingo snarled again. Then
Bluey knew why such things were placed
in the ground.
He growled savagely, trying to keep
the dingo off until his mind was finished
with the problem.
These hard-fanged things had been
placed in the ground to catch such as the
dingo. Then it was almost certain that
there were more of them in the ground
about him. If he could entice the dingo
into them. , , .
The captive cattle-dog and the free out-
law dog eyed each other, the outlaw
beginning to exult in the knowledge that
the enemy was at its mercy. All its cun-
ning was being exercised, and it began to
circle Bluey again. As a test it tore
quickly at the dead ewe, its eyes on the
dog. When nothing happened, it began
to circle again. Completing the circle,
it snarled, and its hackles rose as Bluey’s
tail went between his legs and he whim-
pered in fear.
The dingo stepped forward and snarled
hideously. The prone cattle-dog whined.
Satisfied at last, the dingo rushed at]
Bluey’s flank, ripped, and le apt away.
Bluey howled in pain, and then tn
to hunch himself up, awaiting the next
rush. It came from another angle and
left his shoulder gaping ted. The pain
and his impotence almost got the better
of his purpose. How could he endure
these attacks and still pretend fear if the
ground would not produce some of those
steel-fanged things to catch the dingo.
Better to try and make a fight ol it.
The dingo’s third rush, this time at the j
exposed throat of the captive, was
checked two feet short of the objective.
It pitched over its nose, turning a com-
plete somersault, and its flying hind legs
struck the cattle-dog in the face. Blindly,
Bluey fastened his teeth in flesh and hair,
hanging on grimly as the dingo flailed and
threshed, one front paw held in the fourth
trap, one hind leg clamped in the teeth
of the faint cattle-dog, its cowardice now
asserting itself in short howls of pain
and panic. . ...
It was a blue-and-gold morning with
gems of dew gleaming on the tussock
grass. .A choir of magpies carolled
ioyously behind the homestead, smoke
rose from the chimneys, and the horses
began to make their way to the yards at
the call of “Kerp, kerp, come on! Kerp,
kerp, come on! ” . „ . , .
The rouseabout, passing from the hut
to the yards, heard the high chorus ot
alarm from the soldier-birds on the tar
slope and guessed the reason.
Bluey heard the coming hoof-beats and
beat the ground feebly with his tail,
swivelling the eyes in his dusty face to
look down the slope. Straining every
effort to keep his grip on the. dingo s
leg, he panted through his locked teeth,
flinching his side where the flies had
begun to settle on his wounds.
Voodoo and Whistletread.
BY JOHN ANDREWS.
//T*OM! Bom! • Rum, turn! Rum,
turn!”
The dance band performed a
brisk number in the voodooist manner.
“Mr. Whistletread wanted!”
Prettyjohn Whistletread emerged from
behind a potted palm. His starched front
sat uneasily across an immense breadth
of hairiness that sprouted between the
wings of his collar and out below his
cuffs, where his hands hung like hams.
Young De Courcey beckoned him con-
fidentially from the doorway. „
“You know I never touch it, shrilled
Whistletread. . . , .
The big man’s surprising falsetto
never failed to amuse his future son-in-
law “You’re wanted on the ’phone,
he explained, leaving Whistletread to find
the telephone in pitch darkness under the
stairs at the end of the passage.
“Hullo! What? It’s this music. Eh?
What’s up now? You’re always wantm
to know something. Wha-at? Liai.
Who” Whistletread squeaked and
shrilled angrily. “You get ouU ? I dont
care if you don’t buy the place
A rolling bottle underfoot put an end
to it. . , ,
He remained seated where he fell
among the orderly ranks of bottles
hidden under the stairs, his thoughts busy
with his problems. Wait till the wife
and Nellie heard what he’d just said to
old Hudson! A man wouldn’t have a
moment’s peace—harp, harp. Must sell
out and move to the city.
Proprietor of the De Luxe Service ana
Filling Station, petrol insurance, light
and power were his nightmare familiars.
Even so, Whistletread preferred it to the
city. , ,
Most of his life he had spent in
pleasant Bungawilla. If a man had to
make another start he still owned the old
shop there. But it was what they wanted
—harp, harp, harp, harp. Nelly must
have her birthday party, even if it cost
every penny he had. .
He’d put up with too much of it in the
past. Been too damn lenient —thought
a man a fool because he’d got a bit of
an impediment in his. voice. That young
De Courcey grinning at him and old
Hudson baiting a man with his silly
questions. “How do you do this? Why
do you do that?” .
He hurled the bottle in his hand
against the opposite wall.
Twenty minutes later, as he carefully
resumed his seat in the corner of the
ballroom, a bristling shadow fell across
the potted palm. Mrs. Whistletread con-
fronted him.
“It’s a pity you can’t make yourself
sociable!” she snapped. “Leaving every-
thing to me, with my health the way it is.
For one rare instant violence peered
from beneath the beetling brow-ridges,
the prognathous jowl stiffened.
end habit prevailed. Whistletread sidled
towards the door.
Later he leaned against the wall and
complimented himself on a strange new j
feeling of well-being.
He wiped a hand across his eyes as the i
lights dimmed and the band prepared i
for a fresh rendering of the voodooist
number. When he closed his eyes he was
travelling backwards at a tremendous
pace, his feet pleasantly independent. He
enjoyed the odd silence that had fallen, j
“Wah-h! ” wailed the saxophone with- 1
out warning, and hid its infamy behind j
a bowler hat.
“Wam-pah! Wam-pah! Rum, turn, j
Rum, turn!”
He peered around.
“Funny,” he said. “Could’ve sworn 1
saw some of ’em in fancy dress or some-
thing. Mrs. De Courcey, Harold’s
mother, getting round in a bit of fur.
Or was it”
His memory was fogged but he could
see them all right. Even when he closed
his eyes. All the tribe stamping and
shuffling around in the half-light.
He felt like one who hums a tribal tunc
in some jungle and finds himself accom-
panied by a full orchestra. Slowly but
definitely asserting itself, the blood of the
first dim Whistletread pounded in his
veins.
A young man sought him with some
talk of “a message.” But Whistletread
was striding across his cavern to seize
the woman of his choice and whirl her
into the crowd.
Overcoming her astonishment, Mrs. De
Courcey decided to humor him until they
reached the edge of the floor again. But
the band-leader was throwing favors to
the scrambling couples around the dais.
Among them ploughed Whistletread,
reckless of disaster.
A guest stooped to retrieve a favor tor
his lady. Whistletread struck the man
squarely, lost his balance and his grip on
Mrs. De Courcey, and shot among the
legs of the scramblers. Someone trod on
his hand. In the twinkling of an eye he
had seized the nearest ankle and bitten
it savagely.
In a howl of anguish the bitten one
accused a rival of the outrage. Thudding
smacks and cries of “Turn all the lights
on!” inspired a guest to fumble at the
switchboard. With dramatic suddenness
the hall was plunged in darkness.
The band kept playing vigorously, in
the tradition ascribed to bands on sink-
ing ships, and hastily-struck matches lent I
a fairy torchlight effect to the free-for-all
which centred in the recumbent Whistle-
tread, biting and kicking with a catholic
impartiality until the tide of battle car-
ried him on to the dais. There he put his
foot through the large drum. ....
The lights returned, unhappily, with the
local constable, who pushed his way
through the sidelines.
“What’s going on here?” he demanded,
and, in the same breath, “Who’s Whistle-
tread?”
Whistletread rose from the ruins of the
band. ,
“Well if you’re Whistletread,” pursued
the policeman, “the old feller in your
garridge reckons it’s about burnt down.
Says he tried to ring you to find out how
to work the extinguishers, but you hung
up on him.”
A dark thought occurred to the con-
stable. “You might hear more about this.
Insurance,” he added significantly.
“Bungawilla! ” whispered Whistletread
incredulously. “Back to Bungawilla?
Insurance? There is none.
“What, you haven t paid up the insur-
ance?” Mrs. Whistletread’s voice was
urgent with hysteria.
“Nellie had to have her party, shrilled
Whistletread apprehensively _
But there was a happy light in the eye
that hadn’t turned purple.

familiar wrapper printed
in blue.
IT NDOUBTEDLY the present weather is
most trying and if we took stock of the
health of all the community to-day we would
find thousands of people who are in need of
some treatment, the recent weather conditions
having left their mark. hor instance, you
might find with them a strong tendency to
avoid any great physical exercise. In fact,
the sufferers feeling an almost unconquerable
desire to simply sit down and take things
“easy/’ and it is just possible they may experi-
ence dizziness, occasional headaches, and a
general lack of interest in things which deeply
interested them at other seasons.
What is needed is some treatment, the more natural the better, to cleanse
the system and assist the organs of digestion, which have become sluggish
and are working unsatisfactorily. This treatment is best administered in
the form of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which are British owned, and
have a world-wide reputation for stirring the liver, correcting Indigestion,
and toning up the system generally.

Mirpil
Skin Balm
Ideal for
SUNBURN
Mirpil is a soothing and cooling lotion
scientifically prepared to correct chafed
skin, sunburn, windburn, sore and tired
feet. Will keep the skin soft and smooth.
Dries in a few minutes without leaving any
greasy after-effect.
Windburn and Sunburn.— When
the skin is burned by either wind or sun,
or both, one or more liberal applications
of Mirpil will bring relief. If the skin is
too tender to bear being touched by hand,
lay a clean linen or cotton cloth, satu-
rated with the Balm, over the affected
part'.
Mosquitoes and Sandflies.-—Mir-
pil smeared on face and hands at night
will keep mosquitoes away. It also soothes
mosquito and sandfly bites.
Ř
Rough Hands. Besides frequently
having them in water, there are certain
other classes of work in the home, factory,
garden and elsewhere which roughen the
hands of both women and men. The
amount of discomfort thus caused it is
unnecessary to describe. Those who are
affected know it only too well. When
such a condition arises a few applications
of Mirpil will be found to restore the
natural softness.
To Mothers. Baby has to be bathed
once or more each day, and between
times there is constant washing of clothes,
which tends to chapped hands. There is
no reason why a mother should not take
care of herself, as well as the baby. Re-
member that broken skin provides easy
access for germs, and it is of the greatest
importance that the hands be kept healthy
and free from any eruptions that might
infect the baby, either through contact
or per medium of its food. Rub Mirpil
on the hands frequently, and results will
be found to more than compensate for
this precaution.
Chafed Skin . In cases of chafed
skin Mirpil will prove an efficient emol-
lient.
Sore and Tired Feet. —Apply
Mirpil to the soles of your feet when sore
and tired. The relief is wonderful.
After Shaving. A small quantity of
Mirpil rubbed on the face after shaving
will be found soothing.
Before Applying Powder, always
rub Mirpil into the skin until dry. The
cleansing and cooling actions of this pre-
paration will enhance the comfort which
powder provides.
Price, 2/6 per bottle, post paid.
Obtainable all chemists and leading stores or
will be sent post paid upon receipt of postal
notes or stamps by

THE DOUGHMAN”
By Robert Desmond Tate.
The Literary Sensation of the Year.
T his is the Author’s brilliant first novel; it is the first of its kind among our
novelists. It translates, in terms of the sharpest realism, an aspect of life in the raw
in the sweat and steam, the stealth and sinister dealings that may form the
atmosphere of industrial workers. It shows the reaction of a girl of clean character
ana a man who, in other circumstances, might have been an inspiration to men.
