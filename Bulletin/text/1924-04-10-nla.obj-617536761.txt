HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes
CAUTION. —The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name of
►menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure to get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good” as Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-
tions and substitutes have no reputation of
their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes.
Sold everywhere, tins 1/6; or forward 1/6

The Teachers
l.
He went with quiet steps and eager eyes
Through the green places of a thousand
dreams.
Something he read of stars in wind-blown
And something of the shadow-haunted
streams
That kissed the oaks below the ridges brown
When summer made a glory in the land.
But in the huddled wisdom of the town
Were teachers very wise to understand
The dull philosophies* of cheating words
Made strong by repetition, while the Spring
Filled a great sweetness with a song of birds,
And every wave had happy spray to fling
Out of the morning and the shouting sea,
And sun and moon maintained their mystery.
ii. v
Most accurate were those who taught ,the way
To those who sought for what they could
not find— ’
And should not find, for all the stress that lay
On the dull platitude that rasped the mind
Of generations soured by teachers gone.
The words went out upon a useless round
Of sad phrase-gathering, till no truth that
shone
Clear as an autumn sun on harvest ground
Could pierce the denseness of that lettered
haze.
But he that of the yellow woods made
choice,
And recked not of the teachers’ blame or
praise,
Heard the gods speaking; and the starry
voice
Of all the ages of eternal youth
Brought the new vision that is still the truth.
m.
The safety of the teacher lies in this:
Men needs must learn his language ere
they rise
In wrath his weak conclusions to dismiss,
And view the larger world with braver eyes.
How* can his shibboleth of knowledge fail
While he can build anew a strong defence
Of words, rough-edged, about his narrow
pale?
Great is the ancient glory of pretence!
The clashing definitions spare no thought
The scorn of their triumphant subterfuge;
Brave speculations, in grey cobwebs caught,
Forget their strength and see the spider
huge
As some vast lion roaring for its prey. . ..
But life is sweet and sings upon its way!
IV.
When teachers fail they lift their voices loud.
Stress holds a while the falling argument,
And wins a clap of hands from some hushed
crowd
That finds in repetition full content.
And loves the sound of rolling rhetoric.
Ant-logic stirs the nest beneath the heap;
The busy throng has half regained the trick
Of turning the same sand-speck that may
keep
The sweating toiler idler than a king.
Save that afar, in clearer, happier ways,
Some voice could find an ampler song to sing,
The teachers, threading still their weary
maze,
Had turned the dry world down its broken
stair
To the sheer darks of ultimate despair.
V.
But they that gave the word a tingling
strength
Of separate life beyond the life of man
Stayed not upon debate, nor strove with
length
, Of piled-up adjectives to find a plan
To cheat their thought out of its gracious
ways.
They sought the paths of utter loveliness,
Found death, found love, found life; and
rendered praise
In ringing phrases or the long caress
Of syllables that seemed to press the world
Against the beating of each living heart.
The banners of man’s triumph were unfurled ;
And with a fine unconsciousness of art
They led the strong procession of the hours
Back to the graves, the stars, the dreams,
the flowers!

DAVID McKEEE WRIGHT.
The Wonder Way
Of Cambridge in the earlier years of Vic-
toria’s reign Tennyson wrote :
You do profess to teach,
And teach us nothing, feeding not the heart.
How far have we advanced since then? In
no province of life has tradition impressed
itself more deeply than on the education of
children. That education should be im-
parted in the driest of lights, in the drabbest
of surroundings, in the austere atmosphere
of a monastery, rather than in the environ-
ment of “sweetness and light,” and through
the natural play of youthful thought, was
characteristic of the nineteenth century as it
had been of preceding centuries. Indeed, in
the great historic centres of learning it is
only of late, and with reluctance, that the
sacrilegious hand of reform has been allowed
to show itself. Early education, in the day
even of the present adult generation, was a
compulsion of toil without a gleam, or with
but an occasional gleam, of arresting interest.
There was but one permissible entrance gate
to the Temple of Learning, and its archi-
tecture was strictly classical. True educa-
tion in those days began when the scholar
left school. It is against this ancient sys-
tem, its methods and its limitations, that
Miss Margaret McMillan breaks a lance in
Education through the Imagination (George
Allen and Unwin). She appeals—and the
appeal is made on behalf of the children
who later on will fill the higher schools—
for the recognition of imagination as a
potent factor in education.
Imagination Miss McMillan defines as "the
creative power of the mind which lights up
all work, which gives light and meaning to
it at every stage, and gave it birth at the
beginning.” This “creative power,” she
claims, is universal, “as. true of the dust-
man’s job as of the artist’s or the states-
man’s.” There is none so low in the human
scale that he does not possess a share of this
power. She points out the ever-enlarging
field for the use of imagination, in its
capacity for dealing with new situations,
in its power of projection into the future.
The popular conception of imagination must
no longer be confined to the creative efforts
of the artist and the man of letters, but
must be extended over the whole area of
human activities. Its possession was at
one time regarded as “a kind of weakness’
in practical affairs, but it is in these very
affairs that its.strength is greatest. Acqui-
sition of facts through memory is thwarted
of its purpose if it does not provide material
out of which the creative faculty may gen-
erate new ideas, not only in the world of
art and letters, but in the world of utilities
and practical affairs. One recalls that The
Bulletin a few months ago recorded the
opinion of an intimate business friend of the
late James Burns that imagination was the
most valuable asset of that enormously suc-
cessful Australian man of business.
Imagination, Miss McMillan holds, is not
a primitive function, but is, for the
greater part, the creature of memory and
emotion. In the development of her sys-
tem the education of the speech- and hand-
centres marks the beginning. They are
closely related. To speak, to draw, are the
fundamental means of a child’s self-expres-
sion, and of the two the expression by line
is the one that comes more naturally to
him. “A line for a little child,” says she,
“is not an abstraction. It is something he
can make. All labored lessons in writing
would be unnecessary if we allowed him to
develop this power in early childhood and
gave him a little sympathy and help.” Re-
cently an exhibition of art work done
in public (State) schools was held in
Sydney. Setting aside the more or less
skilled and ambitious work of the older
scholars, and concentrating on the efforts
of the small children, a visitor could not
fail to see how line —with the fascination of
color added —was a natural outlet for the
expression of the imaginative faculty. On
a table lay a number of copy-books filled
with children’s illustrations of such books
as Stevenson’s “Treasure Island” and “Kid-
napped.” The illustrations, though utterly
crude in draftsmanship, showed in many
cases vigor and even character, and always
imagination.
Readers of Dickens will have noted how
he vested inanimate things with the attri-
butes of life: a door-knocker ; a chair; a
kettle that was “aggravating and obstinate.”
Miss McMillan points out the same quality
or capacity in children, leading them to see
in everything a life very much like their
own. Under its impulse the child is led
into a garden of imagination wdiere blossom
a thousand quaint fancies, where every bud
that winks in the sunlight is a baby life:
To Art childhood holds out its eager hands.
What if these hands are very feeble? What if lie
has no real conception of beauty as we know it?
He goes forward and cannot be held back, save by
the influence of those around him. He draws as he
can, or, rather, writes pictures. He listens to tales
of wonder and adventure. He plays and invents
plays, if all that is his birthright is not taken
away.
But imagination must be fed, and its food
is stored by memory. “Human memory is
like a river that rolls along and holds every
fluttering image for ever. Everything that
disappears in it is capable of coming back.”
But “memory seems to depend on the whole
movement of physical life.” Where nutri-
tion is insufficient life is languid and memory
defective. Such facts as may be stored are
mean and sordid. This in effect is a plea for
open spaces, ampler life, better food, healthier
surroundings for the child. Thus provi-
sioned memory will be invigorated, emotion
quickened, and imagination find a wider
range for its activity.
It will be a great day for the child when
parent and teacher no longer regard it —
from the view-point of education—as a sort
of human rag-bag for holding miscellaneous
scraps of arid information, but as a little
soul looking out on a beautiful world, won-
dering what it is, and what it means; when
the province of the teacher will be to show
the making and the meaning of it all, so
leading eager feet by pleasant paths to
knowledge.

Rome in the Early A.D.’s
The Golden Asse, by Lucius Apuleius, has
been translated by William Adlington, edited
by W. Osborn, illustrated by .Jean de Bos-
chbre and published by John Lane.
Imprimis, the “Golden” does not mean
“made of gold.” It is used in the same sense
as in “the golden rule,” “the golden num-
ber,” “the golden year”; and if you were to
say “the Ass clothed in white samite, mystic,
wonderful,” you would probably come very
near to what Lucius would have said had he
lived in Goldcr’s Green or Surry Hills. Or
he might have called it “The Adventures of
Lucius Apuleius, Advocate and Philosopher,
Describing his Frightful Experiences when
ho was Transformed into an Ass in the early
years of the Roman Empire—about 150 a.d.”
The Lucius of the story was but a simple
soul, a very Kitcli of a boy, wondering, agape
for the joys of the flesh, and as credulous
as any of those brave Kitchies whom some
of us met —and pulled their legs—at Gal-
lipoli. It seems to have been his occupation
to go wandering open-mouthed about the
Roman Empire saying to people. “Pull my
leg—yea, pull it again and harder. You
shall never be able to pull it too hard !” And
this- they did.
To begin with, he fell in love with Photis,
first of that long line of frank and free
chambermaids whom fiction has invented for
male delectation, though probably woman
was never like that except in male dreams
of Freudian “wish-fulfilment.” She, naughty
thing, induces him to see how a wicked sor-
ceress can turn herself into a bird: and be-
fore Lucius knows what has happened, he,
too, having used the wrong ointment, has
suffered a great change. For while he watches

J
himself lie discovers that in place of his
feet there are hooves, his eyes are moist ana
huge, a great and disgusting tail depends
from a portion of him that is described in
very Saxon terms, his ears have suddenly
grown inordinate, and waggle; his appe-
tite is now for grass; when he tries to speak
a frightful sound issues from his mouth,
and his teeth are like stones. Thus, mis-
understood, scourged and rejected of men,
he is doomed to wander until he can eat a
rose and mutter certain incantations; but,
alas, every rose that he sees appears to be
guarded by men who hunt him away with
sticks, or by dogs who bite and bark at him.
Then “rope-ripe” boys overload him with
logs of fuel} and women shamelessly make
love to him, occasionally to his great em-
barrassment. Sometimes he himself falls in
love, but finds the difficulties placed by fate
in his way overwhelming. He is constantly
in danger of his life; and one gathers the
impression that the Roman Empire must
have been a nest of thieves, witches and
wicked harlots. It would not bo true to
say that his adventures are wildly indecent,
unless you are prepared to say that the
enfant terrible who comes into a drawing-
room and shocks people by asking embarrass-
ing questions is indecent, or that the unblush-
ing frankness of Boccaccio is indecent; but
at all events they are excessively unusual.
Things are said that would never be said in
a morning newspaper; and the gaiety of the
dirt continues until at last one begins to
see that there is a real moral purpose in
it and in its constant sly innuendoes against
the Olympian gods. “Of course,” you say,
“guessed it in one. It was a propagandist
tract for Christianity against the ancient
religion of polytheism.” Not so; quite
wrong! Lucius gets rid of his tail and
hooves, not by prayer to any Christian saint,
but by prayer to, and the direct interven-
tion of, Isis, the Great Mother, who was
worshipped all over the Eastern Roman
Empire under a dozen different names. And,
the dirt suddenly settling down to the lees,
Apuleius ends his parable in a really beauti-
ful and eloquent description of the delights
of Isis and her paradise of flowers and fields.
It is really very like a modern advertisement
for Somebody’s pills, whereby you are in-
duced to read all manner of nonsense until
you suddenly come upon the real meaning
at the back of the drivelling author’s mind,
which is to get you to swallow his pills. Just
so did Lucius say; “Even though you be an
ass, and have to suffer all manner of indig-
nities to the loss of your maleness itself,
only believe in Isis, and you shall be saved.”
The modern unregenerate male would wish
rather to have heard the last of pretty I’hotis
than to be treated to a sermon on the great-
ness of Isis and Osiris. But—and this is
the strange thing—in the middle of the
second century a.d. we have always been
told that the Christians were being hanged,
drawn and quartered all oyer the Empire,
and made into fodder for lions; saints and
martyrs were arising wholesale. Apuleius
describes the life of the Roman Empire with
extraordinary vividness. But whore are the
Christian martyrs? There seem really to
have been only two great contending reli-
gions at that time —the ancient religion of
Jupiter and Venus and the wonderful new
faith of Isis and the spirits of the corn and
of the wild. What has happened to the early
Christianity? Is it possible that the tales of
the scoffers is true —that when you get the
Itomaps by themselves, without any inter-
ference by the supposed “early fathers” of
the church, they knew nothing whatever
about the wonderful revolution that was sup-
posed to be then wrought in mankind by
Christianity. Is it possible the tales of the
(“ally Christians and the martyrs were in-
vented centuries later? Undoubtedly this has
been maintained, and fierce contests over it
have been waged. At any rate, why does
Apuleius seem to know nothing whatever
about Christianity ?
The illustrations in this edition are won-
derful, and show how much more effective is
the sly suggestion of the French than any
coarse literalness in the way of suggesting
naughtiness. The expression on the face
of the Asse when they threaten that
he shall be gelded is something that
would stir the wowser’s repressed sex
to its deepest orgasm of rage. And what
would he say if he were to observe the one
and only Asse about to yield in fear and em-
barrassment to the blandishments of the
matron? But I know- no other book, not
even the Satyrieon, that gives so extraordi-
narily vivid a picture of life in the early
Roman Empire, with its unbounded credul-
ity, its innumerable wicked witches and sin-
ful harlots, its terrible slaves in the ergas-
tula, its bands of ravening thieves. “The
Last Days of Pompeii” and “Quo Vadis”
are mere children’s pap beside it, for besides
putting in numerous positive lies they leave
out half the truth. You can understand why
Tertullian said, “I believe it because it is
impossible,” after reading “The Golden
Asse.”

Idealism and Honesty
Brian 0. Fitzpatrick’s plea for Idealism
(R.P. 28/2/’24) is an interesting exariiple
of the tendency to confuse two radically
different things. The whole world admires
genuine idealism, whether in the form of
religion, social service or valorous patriot-
ism. One need not be an R.C. to admire
Father Damien, or English or a woman to
admire Florence Nightingale, or German or
a flying man to admire Von Richthofen. It
is when cant and humbug are identified mas-
querading as idealism that the gorge rises
arid the truth is spoken, to the annoyance
those who accept what Mr. Fitzpatrick
calls "the obvious fact that there are grounds
tor hopelessness in one’s outlook upon
human affairs in general,” but argue that
writers arc certainly going to do a lot of
harm unless they keep that fact dark. Never
was a more inverted doctrine propounded,
i t is not the light, it is darkness, that breeds
disease: the truth never did any harm, not
men during the World War, when every poli-
tical and military fraud was busy strangling
it in the name of idealism.
, <icJ ln J se is particularly objected
society lacks the will to be Christ-
\ "° anyone who reflects on what
hrist was and on what Society is it will
seem blasphemous to deny this truism, bin,
to those who hate to face the facts of life it
is a form of blasphemy to afhrm it. It is
an unassailable convention, amongst con-
ventional Anglo-Saxons, that the lace, in
in addition to being lowly, and ready to
turn the other cheek, and share its substance
with the poor, is deeply religious.
says it, though no one believes it. Shortly
after the Armistice I picked up a daily paper
and was struck by a cross-heading: Ine
Kaiser Goes Mad.” It was disclosed in the
body of the article that the doomed monarch
“was spending hours in his bedroom praying
for the Hohenzollern dynasty.” Only that, and
in a Christian newspaper office it was suffici-
ent to convict him of insanity! The Sydney
correspondent of the Argus pays a good deal
of attention to spiritual matters. Shortly
after the Hickson mission, in which the
Sydney church authorities collaborated with
the healer, Archbishop Wright became ill.
With a palpable grin the Argus man wrote:
Archdeacon D’Arcy Irvine looked to the prayers
of the clergy and ” people to restore the patient.
People who were associated with the healing mis-
sion are thinking of the enormous impetus it would
give to the cause of spiritual healing if the Arch-
bishop, relying solely on it, speedily recovered. He
has, however, ordinary medical attention.
The truth is religion is not really taken
seriously by many church people, outside
church hours. To deny it is to be fashion-
able, but absurd. .
Throughout the war a nauseating form ot
so-called idealism was rife, to controvert
which in a public manner might have meant
gaol. I take a sample, not from Bottomley’s
John Bull, but from the Times: —
Where there has been such an evil across the path,
there has been always such a St. George to fight for
the oppressed. The youth of this land would never
have taken the sword as they did if it had not been
for them a crusade. They saw a dragon across the
path, and they had to go. Once more they have
registered in letters of blood upon the tablets of his-
tory their protest against tyranny. They in the
memory of the world will be held with the hosts of
Christian chivalry, and to the long ages they inter-
pret. in act the dreams of seers, who told the praises
of Theseus and Hercules; they are with the martyrs
who thought lightly of their lives.
By April, 1918, when the above appeared,
the youth of the land had lost most of their
war-illusions. They had to go into the line,
it is true, like their German and French
compeers, but they were not going willingly,
on the whole, as the proceedings before the
exemption tribunals testified. They knew by
that time that those who were doing best out
of the war were the Yanks, the profiteers
and the decoration-collectors at the French
and English bases, and they derided the
notion that they were Christian knights en-
gaged in an eager crusade. They resented
the eloquent untruths that were blared about
them by writers on the home front, and, on
the whole, this dishonest fustian did more
harm than good.
Lord Roberts told the truth before the
war, and was reviled. Shaw told it in a
famous pamphlet after the war had begun,
and so, later, did Lord Northcliffe: they
were both reviled. The other day Lord
Birkenhead, as Rector of Glasgow Univer-
sity, addressed the students : —
Self-interest is the mainspring of life whether in
nations or individuals. The world continues to offer
glittering prizes to those who have stout hearts and
sharp swords.
True to * the verge of platitude, and like all
truths, salutary, but distasteful to the hypo-
crites who delight in pretending that the
world is other than it is. One critic described
the pronouncement as “an affront to our
common Christianity,” and another called for
“some sort of public repudiation by the
Senatus of the University of this speech
which is full of contempt for what the
lecturer might have assumed was the moral
sense of the City of Glasgow.”
The wise counsel. “Know thyself,” applies
to communities and nations as much as it
does to individuals. A race can gain nothing
by blindness in regard to its weaknesses, but
a dangerous self-complacency and the scorn
of its neighbors. Let us recognise, then,
that in the mass we are predatory, cowardly,
irreligious, selfish and not particularly
honest, when out of the policeman’s range of
vision, and we shall be all the readier
to humbly render idealism in the rare cases
where idealism is due.
J.B.D.
In Their Own Country
Eight or ten years ago I was sitting in
the office of the editor of a small weekly
when he threw over a short story. “Written
by a girl in the country,” he said. “Quite
good.” “Using it?” I asked. “Now, how
can I?” he demanded defensively. “If we
accept it we can’t offer her less than two
guineas.” (Seeing that the thing was 5000
words long, this was hardly extravagant.)
“Is it likely we’ll use it when here a
short story by a well-known writer, A. W.
Marclimont, that we can have for live bob?”
Knowing the principles on which the paper
was run, and the size of the proprietor’s
stable, I agreed that it was not likely. But
I added that it was none the less a damned
shame. “Ah, yes,” he agreed with amiable
tolerance, smiling at my youthful idealism,
“quite true, quite true. But business is
business.”
It is this spirit that is strangling Aus-
tralian fiction. Most of the wealthier Aus-
tralian morning journals are still dominated
by the ideas—and in some cases the methods
—of 1SG0; and they have all the Manchester
School’s cold contempt for the under-dog
without any of the Manchester School’s
ability. Here and there are proprietaries
that buy a good deal of original matter and
pav pretty well for it —I am glad to say
that I work for one of them —but the majo-
rity would cheerfully buy syndicated stuff
if it involved the death of the last Austra-
lian writer in the gutter. And, according to
their lights, why shouldn’t they? The sacred
law of supply and demand must be obeyed.
If the man couldn’t make a living there was
obviously no demand for his work. And
since having no demand for your work is
the one unpardonable sin, the best thing that
can happen to such people, according to some
of our enlightened journals, is that they
should take to washing dishes or making
roads. (Was not Keats told to go back to
his gallipots?) Failing that they can die—
always provided, of course, that they die
quietly and cheaply, and do not carelessly
leave the body lying about to be buried at
the expense of the parish. A journal that
nets £IOO.OOO a year is then free to show
its appreciation of literature and its broad
human sympathies by announcing benevo-
lently that “we shall be pleased to acknow-
ledge contributions to the fund for the assist-
ance of the widow and children of the late”
So-and-so.
Now and again, of course, there are in-
effective protests, and somebody suggests
that Australian writers should themselves
go in for syndicating through some agency.
But little ever comes of it. The agency pro-
bably has not the same pull as the big over-
seas organisations: and the Australian jour-
nals which were so intensely patriotic from
1914 to 1918, and wrote such weighty lead-
ers on the growth of Australian nationalism,
don’t care much for Australian stuff, any-
way. They prefer Le Queux’s stories of
Monte Carlo, with half a dozen assorted
crooks in each, vamps to match, three split
infinitives to the page and anew corpse in
every chapter. And so the Australian novel-
ist is more syndicated against than syndi-
cating.
It is a great pity, for there is no question
that, judged even from the purely commer-
cial point of view, a number of Australians
have the stuff in them. Take two —Boy
Bridges and Bernard Cronin —and tell me
wherein they are inferior to many of the
best sellers abroad. Bridges, a Tasmanian,
who started writing fiction because it was
in him, and had to find expression, has writ-
ten more than a dozen books in some half
a dozen different veins, and in all of them
writes well. “Merchandise,” an ambitious
and sincerely-written story of modern life;
“The Tats of Tyre,” an imaginative and
highly-colored romance of Palestine and
Egypt; “Green Butterflies” and three or
four good yarns of Van Diemen’s Land;
“The Black House” and “Rogues’ Haven,”
two rattling adventure stories in which
the eighteenth-century atmosphere is cap-
tured with an adroitness that in places
suggests Stevenson —surely these give Mr.
Bridges a place amongst the leading
fiction writers of to-day. I do not
suggest that he is a Hardy or even
a Galsworthy. But I do say that
as an Australian writing fine Australian
fiction he deserves better of us than Ethel
Dell, E. M. Hull and Rex Beach. And yet
the royalties from his books are not suffi-
cient to preserve him from hack work on
the Melbourne Age. Cronin is in the same
position. A natural storyteller with a
strong dramatic instinct and a liking for
fast action, he knows intimately the
country and the people he writes
about —the miners, timber people and
trappers of North-Western. Tasmania
and in “Timber Wolves,” “Salvage”
and “Bluff Stakes” he has given us three
of the best adventure stories written in
Australia since Boldrewood and Clarke.
They are quite as romantic, quite as virile
and quite as gripping as anything Zane Grey
or Rex Beach ever wrote; and they tell of
our own people and our own country. But
the ancient rule about prophets applies
equally to novelists, and so we find Cronin
highly praised by the London Bookman and
mostly ignored by the Australian public.
True, lie sells in Australia as well as any
Australian writer. But when you realise
that publishers usually give our writers a
flat rate of 3d. a copy and limit the edition
to 2000. it is not hard to see why our novel-
ists cannot hope for the valets and butlers
and Rolls Royces that come as a matter of
course to the fellow lucky enough to be born
in Madrid or Bayswater or Kalamazoo
(Mich.).
G. C. DIXON.
A Satchel of Books
Some Emotions and a Moral, by John Oliver Hobbes,
and Mademoiselle lxe, by Lanoe Falconer (Mary G.
Hawker), are the latest additions to Unwin’s attrac-
tive Cabinet Library. Both these books were first
published in 1891, and this makes the ninth edition
of the former and the seventh of the latter. The
study of tiie mysterious Russian governess seems
to have lost some of its appeal with the passing of
the years; but Mrs. Craigie’s epigrammatic style
invests her boook with an abiding freshness.
Old People and Things That Pass, by Louis Coup-
erus, which has been included in Thornton Butter-
worth’s “Popular Edition of Famous Fiction” series,
is the most striking thing that has come from this
fine Dutch writer. The hero is 89 and the heroine
93 at the opening, and the book is a powerful study
of their hidden tragedy which, slowly and inexorably,
is revealed to generation after generation of the
children, though the old, old woman, when life is
finally flickering out, reflects that God has been very
good to her, notwithstanding her “sinful soul
for no one knew, no one knew.”
Ariel, by Andre Maurois (John Lane). When
Marirois wrote “The Silence of Colonel Bramble,”
and again “General Bramble” (he was an interpreter
with a British Divisional staff during the war), he
endeared himself to a large circle outside France.
Now comes “Ariel” to add to the debt of the English-
speaking world to this delightful writer. “Ariel” is
Shellev, and the book is a biography .in novel form.
The glamor surrounding this spirit-like being is sug-
gested with extraordinary skill, and though Shelley's
story represents the essence of tragedy, the genius of
Maurois shows it also as the essence of farce—which,
like so many poignant tragedies, it was.
V. S. Wales (11)20-1923), by H. N. Maitland (John
Sands). A remarkable compendium partaking of the
characteristics of a historical work and a guide book
de luxe. The story of Sydney is told, with the
help of reprints of old engravings and air photo-
graphs, from Phillip’s arrival with the first fleet to
the end of last year. From the city the author
proceeds to the suburbs and so to the country. He
presents the country in the form of a series of
studies of famous stations, such as Boonoke, Brindley
Park and Haddon Rig, with scores of pictures of
the sheep and cattle bred on each. And scattered
throughout the handsome volume arc items of infor-
mation about trout-fishing, private and public finance,
cotton-growing, dairying, mining, the railways and
so on.
The Life of Anne Boleyn, by Philip W. Sergeant
(Hutchinson). This writer, setting out to discover
the true character of Henry VIII.’s second wife,
comes to the conclusion that she has been libelled.
He admits her craftiness and her belief in practising
her audacious motto, “Ant illic aut nuUibi,” in her
social ambitions, but he discounts a lot of the tales
of her unchastity, because they come from prejudiced
sources, notably from the mischievous Eustace Chapuys,
who was the Emperor Charles’s ambassador in Lon-
don in 1529, and was on that account a furious
partisan of Katherine of Aragon duriug all the time
the restless English monarch was bombarding Pope
Clement VII. with requests for a divorce. The author
draws heavily on Chapuys for details of Anne’s life,
but carefully examines the ancient courtier’s accusa-
tions, which he considers not proven, w’hile he makes
much’ of . the fact that her behavior to Henry before
her marriage was inconsistent with the theory of
her accommodating virtue. Probably the historian’s
fair-mindedness will be mistaken for charity, but he
has made out a case for a kindlier attitude to the
tragic Queen.

HIS is the problem, in the habit-forming years, to awaken interest , whether in music or the other
desirable graces that make for well-bred manhood and charming femininity. In interest lies apprecia-
tion. In appreciation reside the germs of ripening acquaintance. From continual contact comes the
familiarity which enables man or woman to wear such graces as an accustomed garment.
And above all other things, must music be a close companion. Its pleasures and comforts, its powers
to sooth hurts of soul and mind ; its cheerfulness and uplift are more readily understood and used,
as knowledge of it expands in scope and increases in character.
The New Beale Player-Piano provides this opportunity
for expansion. It is a complete, interpretative instru-
ment that will enable you to guide, with positive
surety, the faltering steps of your children’s early
musical adventurings.
With it you will journey forth with them into a won-
derful land of romance. With them you will sweep
the skies in Wagner’s "Ride of the Valkyries. ” With
them you will buffet the wind and rain and sleet in
Weber’s "Storm.” You will guide them in the wisdom
of your own knowledge of what is best; you will play
with an artistry that will teach respect for the posses-
sion of adequate technique. Later, actual use of the
player, by themselves, may be encouraged as a spur
to analyse rhythm and phrasing, long before their
manual dexterity is sufficiently developed.
This is the way in which the New Beale Player is being
used by many other parents who value music as a
distinctly home influence. It is the one instrument
which provides a perfect piano for manual use, with
controls that make artistic interpretation, not merely
possible, but almost instinctive. It is the New Beale of
which Mr. Oscar Asche wrote, saying; "It is impossible
to express in mere words my appreciation of your instru-
ment.” Its endorsement is unanimous amongst many
eminent musicians, both as an instrument with high
interpretative ability and concert qualities.
The encasements of the New Beale are genuine cabi-
net woods, double hand-selected. Rich Italian wal-
nut, low-toned mahogany of correct hue, rosewood of
historic fame, make it a piano to kindle pride of
ownership.
It is easily purchased, being within the reach of even modest incomes. Silent pianos accepted
in partial exchange and liberal terms extended'where desired. Printed matter posted free.

The Bush Garden.
Into this garden set
Around with towering gums,
To rose and violet,
With petals, fresh and wet,
At eventide there comes
On every wind that blows
The fragrance of bush-flowers —
Gold wattle and wild rose.
Untrimmed, untended all,
From hollow and from hill.
What time the shadows fall,
And homing peewits call
Down spaces green and still,
From hidden groves and bowers,
With odors faint and sweet
They greet the garden flowers.
From tended square and plot,
Their petals fresh and wet —
Noon's burning kiss forgot,
His wooing, fierce and hot—-
Red rose and violet
In sweet, responsive mood
With precious perfumes greet
Their woodland sisterhood.
The tall gums nod their heads,
As though approvingly,
And Silence, smiling, treads
Among the greens and reds
Of bracken, bush and tree,
While, soft and sweet and strange,
Bush flower and garden flower
Their odors interchange.

The Window.
Since early dawn the driving rain
Has lashed against the windowpane.
The bitter wind has fiercely flung
Swift icy torrents till the roofs,
Hail-smitten, thundering have rung.
As though beneath the beat of hoofs.
But now the storm has passed. I see
Far fair blue fields of faerie.
Within that lovely azure space
•The clouds drift soft with careless grace,"
Like dewy petals falling white
From skyey blossoms. Clear and still
And beautiful that place of light.
There my untrammelled heart at will
May stray ; there joy and peace belong,
And every wind's ecstatic song!
Is that translucent, wondrous blue
An ocean where adventures woo
The eager soul, where lie at ease
Cloud galleons, whose snowy sails
Are set to search uncharted seas,
Untouched of storms or troublous gales.
Upon whose gilded prows there gleams
The golden light of splendid dreams?
If I could journey thither, roam
Those fields of space, that cloudy foam,
How joyously my heart would share
The boundless freedom of the sky,
Illimitable, windswept, fair,
Whose crystal purity, set high
Above earth’s toil and littleness.
Holds happy power to heal and bless!
Strange waters that enchant, enthral;
Blue skies —-alluringly you call!
In vain, alas ; for bleak and loud
The wild wind blows, the sleet falls fast;
The tossing trees are bent and bowed.
The low grey dreary clouds drift past;
And I am prisoned once again
Behind the rain-drenched windowpane.
VICTORIA.
ETHEL MARTYR.
Had I the Wealth of Pharaoh.
Had I the wealth of Pharaoh,
His power and glory too,
I'd build a golden galleon
With silken sails for you.
With decks of polished amethyst
And spars of silver bright,
And faery lamps of crysolite
To charm the hours of night.
With ropes and cords of gossamer
All tuned like viol strings
To woo the magic melodies
The golden Orient sings,
All hung with crimson canopies
And soft, enchanting blue —-
Had I the wealth of Pharaoh,
His power and glory too!
We’d sail and sail where argosy
Has never sailed before,
To isles where summer’s treasuries
Retain her golden store,
Beyond the siren's pleasure halls
To youth’s last land of dreams,
Where speech is always harmony,
A music of lost streams.
Where voices from Lemuria,
Long passed, are singing clear
The old world’s deepest mysteries
That tremble on the ear.
All this, O sweetest treasure-maid,
I’d gladly give to you
Had I the wealth of Pharaoh,
His power and glory too.
Down fern-fringed streams of Maoriland,
And lakes of tropic fire,
By turquoise seas to wonder *isles ; —
The goal of heart’s desire —_
Where rosy dawn comes blushingly
And even's crimson glow
Spreads all her fleecy tapestries
O’er seas the sun-gods know.
To palm-fringed isles that lazily
Bask in eternal light, ;
Where the moon brings her sorceries
To charm the wonder night—
To these fair climes, Carissima,
I fain would -ail with you.
Had. I the wealth of Pharaoh,
His power and glory too.

NO FOE TO FEAR.
The Australian Labor party would not spend a
shilling on the base. They had no quarrel with any
nation in the world. Personally he would not spend
a penny on defence, because Australia had no foe to
fear. — McGrath, M.P. at Ballarat Eight Hour Day
celebrations.
Mr. McGrath’s pronouncement, which has
not been repudiated by any of the Labor
chiefs, provides a cleavage such as that
which formed 14 years ago between the
advocates of an Australian navy and those
who believed in saving money by adhering
to the old system. The anti-defenceites of
the pre-R.A.N. period also believed that
“Australia had no foe to fear”: pacifists
always do. In England 14 years ago men
as perceptive as Lord Haldane considered
an Anglo-German war unthinkable, and the
type of Australian who argued then for the
defence of the Commonwealth by a handful
of obsolete ships would have derided the
idea that the lives of our coastal cities were
soon to depend on up-to-date R.A.N. cruisers.
That the Labor party has managed to per-
suade itself that this country, which takes
considerably more pains to exclude Asiatics
than it does to exclude disease, is viewed
with approval by the colored races is
apparent. And so is the fact that Labor
credits the crowded and hungry Orient with
a virtuous self-control, an absence of any
desire to share in the possessions of “capi-
talistic monopoly,” which has certainly not
distinguished Australian workers in the past
half-century.
* * * *
Some time ago Federal Labor-leader
Charlton deprecated the spending of money
on warships, since "Australians ivould be
imbued with ten-fold strength if the Com-
monwealth was ever invaded, and would
easily account for any enemy on their own
shores.” This might have been accepted as
a sincere, though misguided, view if Labor
had not done everything possible of late
years to preclude the inhabitants of the
Commonwealth from saving the country in
the event of its being invaded. It is Labor
propaganda which is rapidly destroying the
moral of the C.M.F. When Australian Labor
supported compulsory military training most
of the trainees regarded it as an honor to
wear their country’s uniform : the discipli-
nary standard was high even in some of the
roughest city districts, and in consequence
the organisers of the A.I.F. found a useful
lot of officers and n.c.o.’s ready to their
hands. It did not require the disorderliness
which characterised last month's annual
camps in both Victoria and N. S. Wales to
satisfy the public that Labor has effectively
white-anted the trainee system for which
Labor was originally so largely responsible.
Further, Labor is frankly hostile to immigra-
tion, and it blocks each fresh move in the
direction of establishing arsenals and supply
depots, without which modern nations can-
not wage war. All this lends an air of hum-
bug, not to say fraudulency, to Charlton’s
talk of home defence; indeed, if the Com-
monwealth dispensed with its military
forces altogether it would be very little
worse off than it is. Australia is what
Britain was (but no longer is) strategically
—an island. Before the world-war brought
about the intensive development of flying,
the Channel was a wall that ensured the
safety of London. To-day that wall is gone for
defence purposes, and experts estimate that
aeroplanes carrying the latest bombs and
gases could level the heart of the Empire
and destroy most of its inhabitants inside 24
hours. Small wonder that the Ramsay
Macdonald Government is concentrating on
air defence, has cut the exiguous regular
army down to a point where it suffices for
little more than ceremonial purposes, and
has even reduced expenditure on the R.N.
to a scale well below the-1914-1915 standard.
Australia’s true defence model is no longer
Britain ; it is the U.S.A. America is always
liable to have a little expeditionary war on
its hands—in Mexico, Haiti and elsewhere
—and Federal troops have been used lately
both for strike-breaking and for prohibition
enforcement; yet the regular army has been
reduced since the Armistice to an effective
force of 25,000 men, 5000 of whom are in
the Philippines. On the other hand the
Government is proceeding to the limit
allowed by the Washington Conference in big
ships, and in 1929 will have 122 submarines
to Japan’s 79 and Britain’s 31.
The TT.S.A. —like Australia—has “no
quarrel with any nation in the world.” It
only asks—like Australia —to be allowed to
make its Alien Restriction laws and enjoy
its wealth in peace and comfort. The for-
tunate demand no more in any walk of life.
A capitalist has no quarrel with his neigh-
bors till one of them tries to take his money ;
a politician is on friendly terms with all
until a rival attempts to win liis seat.
America is dispensing with its army, relin-
quishing the gaudy vision of a death-grapple
with a foreign foe. on its home soil, not be-
cause it is under the delusion that the Pacific
slope is an unwanted region, but because
the nation realises that the battle for such
prizes will be fought many miles away.
Australia’s position is the same, with this
qualification—that, whereas America has
within its own borders every facility for
manufacturing arms and munitions by means
of which the most warlike invaders could
eventually be dislodged, the Commonwealth
has no facilities of the sort, and no skilled
operatives to undertake the work, even
assuming that factories could be started out-
side an enemy’s range of action. For the
rest, this country offers one of the most
genial climates in the world over much of
its vast surface. It either produces, or
could be made to produce, enormous quanti-
ties of meat, wool, wheat and cotton, and
those are the commodities for which Asia
is hungering more and more desperately
every year. It is as desirable to the crowded
countries off our northern coasts as food
is to a hungry man, as the fortune of Dives
is to Lazarus. Our Alien Immigration laws,
those arrogant intimations to the colored
races that they are not wanted in the para-
dise we have marked out for ourselves, are
no less objectionable than those of the
U.S.A., in support of which that country
maintains a formidable Pacific fleet. Indi-
vidual Labor politicians of the McGrath
type may be as friendly and internationalist
as they please, yet the day will surely come
when one of the excluded nations will tell
us to be genuinely internationalist and aban-
don our exclusive White Australia doctrine,
or face the consequences. The ensuing con-
flict may take place five thousand miles
away: all that is certain is that it will not
be on our eastern coast line. For the
enemy’s objective will be to do to us what
the German navy aspired to do to Britain
—cut off those supplies on which an island
nation’s life and credit depend. Once Aus-
tralia is beaten at sea its coastal cities will
not be taken by storm: they will be occu-
pied. And the spectacle of a fluent L.abor-
ite, bearing the Red Flag of world-brother-
hood, and protesting indignantly that his
party had refused to arm in defence of a
White Australia because they regarded the
insulted and famished colored races as
friends, would not affect the proceedings.
In fact, such an argument, in the estimation
of any Asiatic general or admiral who was
aware that workers of this type had always
been readiest to discriminate against colored
workers, would appear a unique piece of
effrontery.
THE TROPIC LAND OF PROMISE.
At long last it is proposed, though very
shyly, to resume work on the south end of
the South-to-North railway, and carry the
Port Augusta-Oodnadatta line another 3971
miles, landing it at Alice Springs. The
scheme is of importance for three reasons:—
(1) P means starting work at the cool end, which
is also tlie cheap end, for material can reach rail-
head by train direct.
(2) It means a certain measure of defence supplied
early. The Territory will begin to be joined on to
’ settled Australia when the first mile of railway is
built over the southern border, while by working
from the north it wouldn't be connected till the last
mile was uuilt down to the border. Extension from
the north might mean that an enemy landing at
Darwin and aiming at occupation would find a line
to take him down to Alice Springs, while the
defenders had no connection at all.
(3) To resume construction from the south is to
give a fairly definite assurance that the compact
made when the Territory was handed over to the
Commonwealth is to be honored.
But though the Bruce-Page Government
is a vast improvement on its predecessor
in this and every other matter, it can’t be
said that its proposals, which are very ten-
tative proposals as yet, err on the side of
enthusiasm. The extension, should it come
off. is to he built on the present unsatisfac-
tory narrow (3ft. Gin.) gauge. The Gov-
ernment is powerfully anxious about stand-
ardising the State lines, but instead of stand-
ardising its own lines it is making the old
discrepancy worse. However, even an un-
satisfactory railway is better than none, and
if the foolishness of the makeshift work is
emphasised overmuch it may become a case
of having none. Then it is suggested that
the cost of the 3974-miles extension, origi-
nally estimated at a little over four millions,
may be reduced to about 14 millions by the
use of light second-hand rails, and by having
steep gradients and flimsy bridges. Some
years ago the Commonwealth had another
railway-building project on its hands. It
was a matter then of developing the lands
of a State (Westralia), and not, as in the
present instance, of improving and making
available Federal lands. There was no obli-
gation to build the western line as there is
with the northern one; it was merely that
a large politician with votes at command in-
sisted on having it. The western road tra-
verses one of the most remarkable flat wastes
that a railway was ever built through; it
isn’t seriously required for defence purposes;
it supplies no short cut to anywhere, for
the new land route is longer than the old
sea track; it opens no fresh road to Europe,
Asia, America or even Barataria. Yet when
Westralia’s big man demanded a big railway
in a big voice, the Commonwealth rushed
to give his State the best that money could
buy, and never stopped work till the job or
jobbery was finished, and didn’t even make
sure that the big man’s country would keep
its promise and unify its Kalgoorlie-Perth
section to complete the work, which it
refuses to do even to this day. On the
other hand, in addition to the Soutli-to-
North line being a matter of solemn con-
tract, it is wanted for the settlement and
defence of the most threatened section of
the Commonwealth; it will shorten the dis-
tance from south to north of Australia by
1500 miles; it will lead to mountains of a
sort, and tp rivers (the central town of
Alice Springs is 1926 ft. above sea-level, and
the Finke River, in the same locality, is re-
puted to be 1000 miles long) ; it will open
new routes to various continents; and its
mineral fields are practically virgin, the im-
possible cost of camel carriage having kept
them so. In addition to all else, the Terri-
tory is Federal land, with a claim on Federal
money. But it has nothing save its merits
to recommend it, and lacks the attraction
for vote-hunters that Westralia and any
other State possesses. So a narrow-gauge
railway, built on a very slow instalment
plan, with a makeshift roadbed and second-
hand rails, is held to more than meet its
demands. And this paper is almost afraid
to mention these things lest the fact may be
seized as an excuse for not supplying even
that much.
* -# * *
A melancholy impression prevails that
Tropical Australia has made no progress, and
shows no sign of making any. The idea is
very far from correct. Settlement began in
the south because the tangled tropic seas
were places that the old sailing-ship navi-
gator avoided, and the gold finds gave the
south a temporary monopoly of immigrants.
After these influences exhausted their force
the only things that were wrong with the
north were the huge bloated political divi-
sions of most of the mainland, the lack of
successful separation movements, the want
of new States and new capitals (Australia
always grows new population round a capi-
tal and never much anywhere else), and the
consequent habit of misgoverning or neglect-
ing three-fourths of Australia by telegram
or postcard from the huddle of cold-weather
cities in the south and south-east. The de-
gree of failure to bring about settlement in
the three tropical provinces is in direct
ratio to the remoteness of the seat of gov-
ernment which professes to run the show,
and that remoteness largely depends on the
size of the absurd States. These are the
records :
TROPICAL PART OP NORTHERN TERRITORY.
—The worst sample. It was originally ruled from
Adelaide, 3415 miles by sea from its principal town,
and dependant on the sea route. Afterwards it was
worse-managed from Melbourne, 3010 miles away, be-
cause a lost its voting power when it became
Federal property, and was nobody’s care and any-
body’s dog.
TROPICAL WESTRALIA.—Better cared for and
making steady but limited progress because it has
members in Parliament, and a scrap of political in-
fluence to sell, and its northern town (Wyndham) is
only 1960 miles distant from the seat of government.
Such a distance is mad enough, but not so utterly mad
as the case of Darwin.
TROPICAL QUEENSLAND.—By far the best
sample, but then it has considerable voting power,
and its most northern townlet is a mere 1175 miles
by direct sea track from its Government and
Parliament. That is quite a moderate range as
this country’s ideas go. Brisbane began to rise for
no visible cause save that when it had 7000 people
(and when the whole State had 25,000) it was made
the capital of a new State. But for that it would
be another Eden or Portland. Hence these results:
POPULATION OF TROPICAL AUSTRALIA.
Queensland. Westralia. N. Territory.
1881.. 56,041 661 3,451
1891.. 108,986 3,711 4,898
1901.. 145,982 4,064 4.096
1911.. 157,112 . 4,998 3,310
1921.. 181,397. 5,691 3,774
From this certain inferences are drawn.
Tropical Australia is a good enough place
given railway communication and an Admin-
istration which is on the spot, or near
enough thereto to know what the spot looks
like. Tropical Queensland is the only one
of the three divisions with enough fixed popu-
lation to build comparisons upon, and the
evidence is fairly satisfactory. The birth-
rate per 1000 women is much higher in tropi-
cal Queensland than in the rest of Queens-
land or in Australia generally (141 per
1000 to Australia’s 107). The death-rate
among children aged one year and under is
the lowest in tropical Queensland (55 per
1000 against Australia’s (53), and the death-
rate among females is also the lowest (790
per 10,000 against Australia’s BG6). The
male death-rate isn’t so good, but a place
that is the best for women and babies is no
bad place. When Central and North Queens-
land have done so well under existing con-
ditions it may be assumed that they would
have done better under better conditions, and
that their principal towns would have emu-
lated Brisbane if given Brisbane’s oppor-
tunity. And the Territory would almost
certainly have fully emulated Central and
North Queensland if supplied with even their
moderate opportunity. The spasmodic loss
of population has no necessary relationship
to climate. Last census showed that half
N. S. Wales was losing population, and the
districts which lost most were those which
were governed from the greatest distance and
had the poorest means of communication. In
fact, the biggest division of all lost 20 per
cent, of its inhabitants in the 1911-1921 do-
cade, and the N.T. hardly fell to that level.
THE LIAR AND THE LAW.
The jury filed out of court to consider their
verdict. He was the last, the twelfth, man
and lagged behind. His Honor saw him cast
a glance of inquiry his way, and quickly re-
sponded. “Is there any question you wish
to ask before you retire?” he said. The
juror gave a sigh of relief. “Yes, your
Honor. What I want to know is whether
he really did steal the watch !” That very
appositely puts the frame of mind in which
scores of jurymen leave the box after having
had a mass of conflicting evidence hurled at
them. Someone had lied, but which was tin'
liar? It is not often an indictment for per-
jury is filed. It is an offence difficult to
prove, and juries are loath to convict. In
a recent case a N. S. Wales Judge made a
very sweeping assertion. He said that in
practically every case before a judge or
magistrate perjury was committed in some
form. Had his Honor said “lying” instead
of “perjury” it would have been a sad but
sober fact.
The difficulty in these cases is that, while
all perjury is lying, all lying in the witness-
box is not perjury. Nor does it, from a
more critical point of view, follow that all
we call “lying” is so in its essence. There
is the “lie obvious,” as expounded by Mr.
Ciiadband. “If the master of this house
was to go forth into the city and there see
an eel, and was to come back, and was to
call untoe him the mistress of the house, and
was to say, ‘Sarah, rejoice thee with me,
for I have seen an elephant,’ would that be
trewth?” There can be no doubt there. But
set two or more allegedly veracious persons
to witness the same incident, then take them
apart and examine them closely in detail
upon what they have seen and heard, and
finally compare their statements. You utrill
conclude, as every thoughtful man who has
had anything to do with the administration
of justice concludes, that in detail at least
all human machines do not register facts
alike. They may fail to record part, or by
suggestion, or through some idiosyncrasy of
temperament, record more than is presented;
or they may color it or distort its features.
Some years ago experiments were carried out
to test the reliance that could be placed on
the human machine to record physical facts.
The tests showed that the mind was apt to
assimilate suggestion with fact, and select
some details to the exclusion of others. On
the whole it was not an instrument in which
to place implicit faith. Consequently when
in your haste you call your brother a liar
it may be just as well to sit down, think it
over calmly, and perhaps apologise.
Still, there is the “lie obvious,” Mr. Chad-
band’s sort of lie. An eel is so far removed
from an elephant that it could not, by any
normal mind, be distorted out of recognition.
There is unfortunately plenty of this obvi-
ous lying in our courts. Sometimes it
amounts to perjury; sometimes it does not.
A concise definition of perjury is “the
wilfully giving, under oath, in a judicial pro-
ceeding or course of justice, of false testi-
mony material to the issue or point of in-
quiry.” The intention must be wilful, and
that intention is wilful where the witness
knows that what he is saying will deceive
the Court. lie may think that he is avoid-
ing the net of “the truth, the who! : truth
and nothing but the truth” ; but if the result
of his clever manoeuvres is to deceive the
Court in a material fact, he will be guilty of
perjury. Qualifying words such as “believ-
ing,” “thinking” and so on will not save
him. On the other hand, a charge of per-
jury could not be supported on manifest
slips, or honest mistakes, or confusion aris-
ing out of the battle of cross-examination.
The facts sworn to must be material to the
issue before the Court. If the witness lies,
because it is his nature to, and he must have
an outlet, he should direct it to irrelevant—-
that is, “immaterial” —matters. In all the
courts, but especially in the lower ones, there
is a wide field of irrelevant stuff on which
the playful liar can disport himself without
trespassing on the preserve of perjury. In
old days larger efforts were made to limit
this field, and even to-day frequent objection
is taken ; but it creeps in like truth into an
affidavit. In the lower courts, where time
is of the essence of the contract, argument
and interruption waste the precious moments.
“Let her tell her tale in her own way Go
on, Mrs. Brown !” And Mrs. Brown once
more starts at the very beginning. If she
is interrupted she will want to start at “the
very beginning” again.
The matter is crystallised in a decision by
Mellor, .1. The facts in the case w'ere
briefly as follows: A. B. had been charged
in a Court of Petty Sessions with having
used language calculated to incite to the com-
mission of a breach of the peace. He ad-
mitted that he had used the language, but
said it was in protest against the cruelty of
C. D. to a horse. C. D. went into the box
and swore that he had not committed any
act of cruelty. If was proved that he had,


and lie was consequently a liar. Was he also
a perjurer? He was indicted for perjury,
and Mellor, J., after consulting brother
Lush, ,T„ held that the horse episode was
merely collateral to the issue and not material
to it. So C. I), went free. Though a liar
he was not a perjurer. Doubts have been
cast on the soundness of this doctrine of
“material to the issue,” but it still stands
good.
A perjurer is not punished out of any con-
cern for the particular person injured by his
false statement. The law is not concerned
whether any particular person is injured or
not. It is grounded on the abuse of public
justice, and in olden times vindicated itself
much more drastically than it does to-day,
for it hanged the perjurer. Later on it let
him off with seven years’ transportation. To-
day he is liable to penal servitude for the
same period, though there are Judges who
deplore the offence, but pity and apparently
sometimes even admire the offender, so that
he escapes with being bound over to be of
good behavior for a few years.
There was no straining of the law to
admit the quality of mercy in the convict
days. In aN. 8. Wales Bench book of that
time appears a record of a convict having
described himself to the Court as a “hired
servant,” he having recently received a
ticket-of-leave, whereas he had originally
been “assigned.” For this mis-description
he was sentenced to 50 lashes, but having
fainted at the 21st lash was thrown off the
triangle. A little later on one who bore the
curious combination of Shakspearean and
Pickwickian names Hamlet Winkle was
sentenced to 50 lashes for “gross prevarica-
tion.” Hamlet seems to have suffered the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune to
the bitter end. As the law of N. 8. Wales
at present stands any Judge of the Supreme
Court, District Court or Chairman of Quar-
ter Sessions may direct a prosecution for
perjury. The stipendiary and police magis-
trates, in whose courts all the petty crime
of the community is dealt with, and where
perjury is rampant, have no such power
given to them. No prosecution can be in-
stituted in their courts without leave from
one of the Judges mentioned. This it is pro-
posed to amend. So long, however, as human
nature remains as it is. with its differences
of sensory power, its susceptibility to sug-
gestion, its proneness to self-deception, pre-
judice and favoritism, so long will Judges,
magistrates and juries ponder “who really
did steal the watch.”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Parliament and Repudiation.
It was Justice Higgins more than anyone
else who stiffened the spines of Theodore
and his colleagues in the matter of the
Queensland “Bepudiation” Act. It is a compli-
cated business. Going back to 1884 there
was no limitation of increase at the periodic
appraisement of rents of either squattages
or selections. In 1886. however, a limita-
tion was pushed in. The next Queensland
land law was passed in 1897: it abolished
the limitation on the rent-increases of pas-
toral holdings, except as to existing tenures.
The 1897 Act lasted only till 1902. Then
the holders under all the old Acts Were by
a new law entitled to surrender their pas-
toral holdings and get new leases up to 42
years at new rents. There were to be perio-
dic reappraisement,*** and increases of rent
were not limited as to either pastoral hold-
ings or selections. That lasted three years;
then (1905) somebody put a measure through
limiting the increases. In short, the same
old process was going on: somebody saw a
chance, of getting a bit more out of the State
cow, and jumped at it. This law lasted
until 1910. Then once more it was thrown
into the pot, and what was alleged to be a
consolidating measure was passed. As pre-
sented by the Denham Government, this bill
abolished the 50 p.c. limitation on rent in-
creases ; but Denham thought better of it,
and, after arguing against a limitation, in-
serted _ a clause re-enacting it, but did not
make it applicable to any pastoral holdings
applied for after the passing of the Act.
The “Repudiation” Act, knocking out this
limitation clause, was passed—after several
unsuccessful attempts—in 1920, the Leg.
Council having been abolished incidentally.
Now, practically all the pastoral holdings
oate from the early ’nineties—the period when
the old leases were thrown in and new ones
issued, mostly for 42 years. The new ones
contained provision, as usual, for periodic
re-appraisement of rent, and there "was no
limitation on the possible increase of rent.
That limitation,, as we have seen, was not
dropped in by Parliament until three years
later. Wherefore Justice Higgins said in
the case of the S. Aus. L., M. and A. Co. v.
the Crown:—
The lease was accepted by the Co. while there was
no such limitation on the powers of the (Land)
Court. The lease was accepted in 1905 ; the legis-
lature enacted in 1910 the limitation on the powers
of the court to one half more rent than in the
previous period; and in 1920 the limitation was
repealed. What the Legislature added to the privi-
leges of the existing lease has been taken away by
the Legislature.
It was a terribly dangerous principle to lay
down; but this High Court Judge laid it
down, and upon that, no doubt, Theodore
took his stand in London that what his Gov-
ernment had done was “entirely Constitu-
tional. The vital point has, of coui'se, not
been settled by the compromise which Theo-
dore has accepted—the rents of the leases
are to stay where they are until the leases
expire; and that will be, in most cases, in
about 20 years. The Legislature will no
doubt pass an amending Act to that effect.
In other words, it will add something to the
privileges under the leases; and, according
to the judgment of Higgins, J., and the
contention of Theodore and his Ministers,
it will be entitled, apparently, to take it
away the week afterwards. This is no good
tor business. When a contract has been
made, under one law, and Parliament passes
an Act amending that law, does that amend-
ment fix the terms of the contract until it
expires? Or is a contract made with the
Crown dependent utterly upon the caprice of
every Parliament, no matter though it be
made for a fixed period? Or is it only con-
cessions made by the Legislature that are
revokable by the Legislature? The last
would be the least startling proposition ; yet
how serious even that may be can be judged
by the fact that, if it holds, this compromise
made by Theodore in London, even though
it be presently endorsed by Parliament, may
be torn up the next day by the same Par-
liament.

Capitalism and Cant.
Sydney Worker, the always readable and
often convincing class paper which once advo-
cated compulsory military service and the
building of the R.A.N., now preaches dis-
armament, and publishes such sentiments as
these over the initials of its editor: —
There is a way in which it could be brought to
pass—by some mighty nation setting the rest oi
mankind a supreme pacifist example.
What if such a nation —Britain, America or France
—were utterly to destroy its weapons; sink its war-
ships, smash its guns; then turn to the world and
say, “There, lam defenceless! I will fight and
slay no more. Henceforth I trust to the goodwill of
my fellows.”
Would not the world be fired to emulation by that
magnificent renunciation, that heroic pacifism?
Thinking quietly at my desk, and striving with
closed eyes to see into the future, it seems that it
might be so.
But outside, amidst the turmoil of existence, 1
am not so sure.
Capitalism is not moved by idealistic conduct. And
it is Capitalism nowadays that makes war. To
exalt strength and enslave weakness —that is its
rule of life.
Perhaps on reconsideration, universal peace is im-
possible till the capitalist system is overthrown, and
Labor reigns victorious in every land.
There is no need to speculate with eyes
closed on what would happen to the nation
in a position to say “1 am defenceless” :it
would suffer the fate of Egypt at the hands
of the Shepherd Kings, of Austria at the
hands of Frederick, of Belgium at the hands
of the Kaiser's legions, of Korea at the
hands of Japan. Not a tittle of evidence
exists that human nature is different from
what it was when the world was younger
and these things happened: the best that can
be said is that mankind, having evolved
devices capable of wiping a city of the size
of London off the earth inside 24 hours, is
beginning to grow apprehensive. Capitalism,
which happens to be the Worker’s particu-
lar King Charles’s head, has as much to do
with it all as chiromancy or corns. Sup-
pose our social defence force which is repre-
sented by the police were disbanded, and
the fortune of the Worker’s friend Fat left
at the mercy of the first-comer. Would the
rich be the only ones to participate in the
scramble for it? Suppose industrial disarma-
ment were brought to pass, and unionism
made illegal by a League of Citizens. Would
there not be plenty of workers, irrespective
of social or financial standing, ready to go to
war with their fellows by toiling long hours,
under bad conditions, for small wages? Sup-
pose the White Australia doctrine—-which is
maintained for us at present, in the teeth of
Asia’s displeasure, by the big guns and
battleships of the country the Worker calls
“Jingoland”—became a dead letter. Would
colored capitalists predominate as immi-
grants over colored coolies? The fact of the
case is the Commonwealth is a capitalist.
And an exceptionally arrogant and exclusive
one at that! The Worker’s proposition is
that such a nation would be relieved of the
costly obligation of providing safes, night-
watchmen, doors, locks and other recognised
contrivances for the protection of wealth
were it not for the criminal activities of a
group labelled “Fat” or “Capitalist.” Actu-
ally, of course, there would be theft and
violence in the world, this side of the millen-
nium. but for preventive armaments of differ-
ent sorts, if there were not a top hat or
protruding white waistcoat in it. And none
knows it better than those in contact with
the people who stand in the same relation
to a millionaire as indigent Asia does to
this gilded land.

The High Cost of Communism.
We gaol robbers and hang murderers: but
foreign-born ruffians who advocate robbery
and murder on a large scale —who would
forcibly dispossess Australians of property
lawfully held and slaughter them in case of
resistance- —are treated with peculiar tender-
ness. They are allowed to form seditious
associations, to stir up ruinous strikes, to re-
pair periodically to Bussia for instructions
(and presumably funds) and to issue tons of
printed matter in which the “workers”
are urged to grab the “means of produc-
tion” and “remove” those who get in the
way. Just now this imported ragtag and
bobtail is trying to get control of the N. S.
Wales Labor party, and, judging by the per-
turbation of Lang, the State Labor leader,
and Loughlin, his deputy, there is a danger
of its succeeding. Lang is trying to rally
the supporters of constitutional methods bv
pointing out that the Bed rapscallions be-
lieve in “the introduction of colored labor”
as well as “the confiscation of all private
property,” that “they hope to establish a
cluiAsy despotism for government by the
people, and are not particular whether they
establish their ends by bloodshed or other-
wise, so long as their own hides are safe.”
But the menace cannot be disposed of by
mere verbal denunciations or even A.L.P.
“rickets.” Measures more practical are re-
quired. A community threatened by insolent
persons of foreign birth with the worst kind
of civil war is entitled to safeguard itself.
One safeguard is a Federal enactment pro-
viding that any person who, not being a
native of the Commonwealth, incites any
section of the Australian people to employ
armed force against any other section, or to
make war on any institution established b.v
law ( e.ff ., Parliament, private property and
the White Australia policy), shall, on sum-
mary conviction, be deported by the first
available steamer to the country in which he
was spawned. This is the American way of
dealing with scummy foreigners who repay
hospitality and protection with advocacy of
a frightful social struggle; and it is a good
way. It is time also to rid ourselves of the
idea that “the workers” get only a small por-
tion of the wealth produced in the Common-
wealth. and that their share would be doubled
or trebled under Socialism. This belief is
at the root of the industrial discontent on
which all manner of collectivists trade, but
it is wildly wrong. Take the State which
is just about to acquire another Labor Gov-
ernment—Westralia. In 1921 there were
332,732 Westralians, exclusive of aboriginals,
and 145,760 were breadwinners (“Census
Bulletin” No. 16, p. 6). That same year—
and it was a good year—the wealth produced
in Westralia was valued by Statistician
Bennett at £20,461,233, which amount,
divided on socialistic principles, would have
yielded each breadwinner only £2 14s. 7d.
per week. Of course, no adult male union-
ist in constant work had as little as that,
and as for the women —well, cooks get £3
p.w. and keep on the goldfields, and barmaids
£4 15s. p.w. without keep in Perth. Con-
sidering that more than half of the output
came froin farms, sheep-stations, cattleruns
and pearl fisheries, on which union labor
was employed either intermittently or not
at all, and that the gross public debt in-
creased by £5,920,000 in 1921-22. most
of the borrowed money being lavished on
Government loan-jobs, a dark suspicion
arises that “the workers” (a term restricted
by Labor politicians and editors to members
of trade unions) received more wealth than
they produced. The Federal income-tax
figures quoted by the trustworthy Bennett
(“Statistical Register,” 1922-23, section 5,
page 9) are illuminating. In 1921-22 47.897
Westralian taxpayers supplied returns of
income amounting to £17.681,466. Of this,
£13,291,029 was earned by persons in the
£lOl-to-£7OO p.a. groups (the exemption
wa,s only £IOO then), £10,934,641 by the
£2Ol-to-£7OO detachment and £2,067,992 by
the £7Ol-to-£ISOO lot. Taxpayers in receipt
of £SOOI and over numbered 61 and their
incomes totalled £527.561, or but 3 per cent, of
the whole. Had “the workers” risen against
these plutocratic oppressors and made a
general distribution of the £527,561. each
white and half-caste inhabitant would have
got a fraction more than £1 11s. sd.

“Vox Populi, Vox Dei.”
It has been said that the moment a demo-
cratically elected Government ceases to be
weak it begins to be unpopular. Australian
experience seems in part to justify the cyni-
cism. It would probably justify it more thor-
oughly only our politicians have a distaste
for being unpopular. Bed Bagger or Tory,
they all have this in common, that their
special characteristic is an aggressive affabil-
ity. Almost every act of legislation or admin-
istration is considered primarily in the light
of the votes involved. There may be other
considerations, but that is usually the decid-
ing factor. In theory this political process
should produce the greatest good to the great-
est number, but in practice it does nothing of
the kind. It works out something like this.
Suppose A. B and (' belong to different
sections of the community. Suppose, further,
that A wants something from Vote Hunter,
M.P. It might be a bridge or a Govern-
ment job, or an advance of seed-wheat —there
is no scarcity of things it might be. But
whatever it is Vote Hunter isn’t likely to
procure it from the atmosphere. Procure
it he will, however, and then, ultimately,
somewhere or other, possibly under some
curious camouflage, this matter is found
charged up to the community. A. B and
C all have to pay in the end, but B and G
don’t bother much because they probably
pay so indirectly as to be unaware of pay-
ing at all. They might even approve, rea-
soning that it is desirable for Vote Hunter,
M.P., to cultivate a custom of charity. They
will certainly want something themselves
some day. The A’s don’t mind, though they
might be the largest losers of all in the not
unusual case where they lose their indepen-
dence. Of course, it so occurs that some
of the things separately demanded by A,
B and C are naturally Governmental activi-
ties ; but many of them are merely vote-
purchasing doles, costly to the community
and degrading alike to the giver and receiver.
Thus it works out that for a democratically-
elected Government to result in the greatest
good for the greatest number it is necessary
for the majority to realise that there is a
“greatest general good,” and then to recog-
nise it when they see it—which is not an
easy matter. It is useless to rail at our
rulers for being what they are. They are
what we make them. Abuse of political per-
sonalities for the most part merely obscures
the fact that the people are as much to
blame as the politician. Such abuse sug-
gests immediately the complementary idea
that some other kind of politicians would
rectify matters. They wouldn’t, because we
wouldn’t let them. What we want to col-
lectively acquire is (in the hackneyed but
vaguely understood phrase) the habit of
thinking nationally. If the Australian indi-
vidual cannot cultivate the custom of seeing
himself in his real relationship with the
community, the community is going to crash,
and with it the individual. The gravest
danger lies in the fact that it is so largely
to the Press’s interest to keep the people
blind to their own faults. To propagate the
theory that the people can do no wrong,
and that, therefore, politicians are account-
able for all the mischief, undoubtedly tickles
the mob’s vanity and helps to swell the
paper's popularity. It also helps to keep
the people very wrong indeed, and, inci-
dentally, insures that there will be stacks
of mischief to be accounted for.
Trial by Newspaper.
Melbourne Trades Hall has registered a
protest against the way in which “certain
newspapers exaggerate the importance of
criminal proceedings by photographs (in 90
per cent, of the cases taken much
against the wills of the people con-
cerned), the result of which is to
create a psychology of guilt before people
have actually been tried.” The scandal
exists to a greater or less degree all over
Australia. To broadcast snapshots of a
man being escorted to court in handcuffs, for
example, must almost inevitably prejudice the
fair trial of that man. It is quite likely
that the whole of the business is illegal. That
a person who pays to be photographed
possesses the copyright of the result is estab-
lished. Why should the copyright pass when
the person taken has not consented to be
photographed, and, in fact, has the best of
reasons for objecting? In any event, and
pending a test case on the question, Parlia-
ment should step in for the protection of
accused persons. Evidently the police will
do nothing of their own motion ; on the con-
trary most of them appear to be almost as
eager to catch the camera's eye as any theatri-
cal star. Another form of publicity which
badly needs to be controlled in some way has
to do with murder inquests. The average
citizen does not understand that an inquest is
not a trial, but an investigation, in the course
of which all sorts of possibilities are probed.
By the time the Coroner has followed up
half a dozen avenues, the accused is liable
to have been condemned in the minds of
thousands from whose ranks his jury may
eventually be drawn. It might make for jus-
tice if press reports of coroners’ inquests were
blanketed altogether.
The Ways of the haw,
“ J.E.” on the unsatisfactory Law: —
The course of law nowadays is that the jury returns
a verdict with costs by way of a beginning. The
Supreme Court is appealed to by the loser if he can
spare or steal the money to go there; and that Court
finds that the jury was ignorant and misdirected, and
reverses the decision, with costs. The High Court
restores it, with costs, and the Privy Council upends
it again, with costs. By this time nothing is done
and everybody is ruined. I am speaking of a simple
case; hut if the winner also appeals on the assertion
that his win wasn't big - enough, or if one party
asks the Court to strike out this or that plea as
irrelevant or embarrassing, and the other finds reasons
for restoring it again, the matter becomes compound.
For these reasons, when a prospective plaintiff with
small means but a promising case consulted me
recently about going to law, I advised him to murder
the rich defendant quietly, and let the discussion end
there. I still think the advice was good; but
it wouldn't apply in every case, because, if the body
was found, that might prove the beginning of litiga-
tion instead of the end. As evidence there was the
long-drawn-out ease of David Kelly, who burned the
remains of his employer, and gave out that she had
gone to the Northern Territory in her old age, and
who, after a whole terrace of trials, was convicted, t
think, of non-registration of birth. Therefore
some other procedure is necessary. One idea is to
allow a single appeal and no more.. The Privy Coun-
cil is always right, there being no higher authority to
say it is wrong. Therefore 1 would invite this body
to open branch offices all over the Commonwealth,
and so get an infallible decision at the first time of
asking. Under present arrangements things are
going from bad to worse. I have some very imper-
fect figures before me, and even they are only up
to 1921 ; still they are eloquent. In 1914 the High
Court decided 03 appeals, and said the lower court
was wrong 25 times, or much less than half. In
1921 it spoke its mind 54 times, and said the lower
court had been an ass 31 times, or much more than
half. By 1928 the lower court (which is the august
State Supreme or even Full Court) will be always
wrong, and by 1936 it' will be worse than that. In
some of these cases the State Court had previously
upset the decision of some other tribunal, and in
some cases it had confirmed the decision of some
other tribunal, and in others it had been the sole
tribunal, but its wrongness stuck to it through thick
and thin. It is a very unsatisfactory business.

"Macquabie Street” on the high cost of
operations:—
The cost of major operations and the means that
should be adopted to lessen the burden put upon
the “middle class” is a matter of great importance.
Knowing that the remedy is a comparatively simple
one and only calls for a little organisation and co-
ordination on the part of surgeons to render it suc-
cessful, one gets exasperated at the interference of
politicians in a matter that does not concern them,
and at the time wasted in preliminary investigations.
That operation costs have become an intolerable
drain on poorly-lined pockets is well known, and a
i ecent letter to the Argus, giving, in ext-enso, a
bill for four weeks' treatment, rings true in every
particular:—
Four weeks’ hospital, at £6 6s £25 4 0
Four weeks’ special nurse, £4 4s. first
week, £3 3s. remaining three weeks.. 13 13 0
Special’s board, 4 weeks, 30s. . . . . 6 0 0
Dressings, salts, and extras .. .. 3 10 0
Chemist 2 10 0
Specialist for operation consultation, opera-
tion, one visit whilst attending another
patient in hospital . . . . . 52 10 0
Own doctor in attendance . . .. 21 0. 0
Anaesthetist . . . . . . . . 3 3 0
£127 10 0
The anaesthetist, as usual, comes off worst. His
important duties have been rated at three guineas.
Five guineas is little enough for his anxiety and
trouble.
Our distinguished visitor, Dr. William Mayo, has
made some valuable suggestions on this question, and
has explained how a community hospital is run in his
home town of Rochester, Minnesota. But Rochester
has a world-wide name and caters for all parts; one
will always find on a boat crossing the Pacific a few
people muffled up and off to Rochester to be operated
upon. In Melbourne, as Dr. Argyll points out,
such an institution would be overcrowded and would
become unwieldy. Everybody would try to get
in at the cheapest rates. There could be no grada-
tion of fees in a big city. In Sydney there are a
few hospitals which advertise that they have a
limited supply of two-guineas-per-week beds. In your
spare time just ring them up. You will find invari-
ably that the last one went yesterday, and that only
the three- and four-guinea beds are vacant. Dr.
Argyll sees no remedy for the existing state of
affairs but national insurance and a large inter-
mediate hospital. The insurance premiums would
pay for the treatment, and the patient would have
no further anxiety. Incidentally, Dr. Argyll has
explained the meaning of the word “Intermediate,”
so loosely applied. It refers to the patient’s finan-
cial position, meaning that he is not. very poor‘and
not' at all rich.
I believe that the solution for us is a hospital or
hospitals where patients arc taken in, for operation,
and pay an inclusive fee. This would cover the
operation and nursing fees, the anesthetist's fee, all
drugs and dressings, and an agreed-upon number of
weeks’ or days’ residence in the hospital. A scheme
to establish an institution of this kind would lessen
the suigical work that is done in Melbourne for
nothing, and I cannot understand whv the medical
profession has not long ago resorted to this means of
getting over an obvious difficulty. An identical
plan is very successful in Leeds.
“Government by the People.”
W estralia lias just chosen a new Assembly
which is as poor a joke upon representative
government as the one in Queensland. Only
there is this difference—the Queensland
electorates were carefully gerrymandered by
the party in power, while the Westralian
ones gerrymandered themselves through the
shifting of population, and everybody in power
was too dog-tired to have a redistribution.
In nearly one-fourth of the electorates there
was no contest, a frequent reason being that
the opinions of the few relics remaining be-
hind on a faded goldfield were so well-known
as to make argument superfluous. In cases
such as those of Queensland and Westralia,

Representatives wanted throughout Australia and New Zealand.
and to a less extent in other cases, a brilli-
ant light won Id be slied on public opinion if
there existed an Upper House, paid at the
same rate as the Lower one, elected by the
same people at the same time, but chosen by
the State as one constituency, in the same
way as it chooses its Federal senators. When
the two Houses disagreed on every possible
point they could decide matters at joint sit-
tings, and when these became a nuisance the
redistribution of Assembly seats would be
hurried on. It is a notable fact that there
is not one State Upper House which its
owners profess to regard as even half satis-
factory, and the minimum of satisfaction is
found in Queensland, which has no Upper
House at all. Theodore's people didn’t like
the Top Chamber when they had one, and
like still less the way they lost it. Yet
any idea of Upper House reform appears to
have died of inanition, and the matter will
probably remain dead till the first new State
is in process of formation, and must have a
House of some sort —or at least a Hutch. And
it is possible that, on the same occasion, the
idea of making the referendum part of the
regular political machine may come alive
again, It might be a difficult device to man-
age in some of the bloated areas of the
Commonwealth, but the difficulty should not
be insuperable. The obstacle so far has been
that only the Labor party wants the referen-
dum (in theory at all events), and the
degenerate Labor party of to-day, or its
leaders at all events, loathe the thing. The
hope of securing both it and the initiative
really lies with dull and moderate persons
of the Fuller type, if they could contrive
to be less dull while remaining equally
moderate, and a lot more active. It might
be necessary to make Australia’s referendum
different from most by appointing some inde-
pendent authority to draft the form of the
question to be submitted to the people, for
crookdom can do marvels at distorting the
issue. But the essential thing is to realise
that Australia is lagging behind. Swit-
zerland has possessed the referendum and
initiative long enough for them to be ancient
history, and some of the younger of the
United States, such as Arizona, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Oregon and Utah,
have adopted them. So has the Irish Free
State. In Britain the Conservatives begin
to talk referendum, having an idea that Pro-
tection would be a good subject for a
definite vote, when it could have a poll all
to itself, and not be mixed up with Ramsay
Mac’s “levy on capital.” The country which
once made the “Australian ballot” famous
has fallen strangely behind the times.
Responsibilities of Governments.
It seems to be a point of honor with those
who clamor most for Public Enterprise to
treat Public Enterprise with more arrogance
and contempt than it attempts with the Pri-
vate article. Thus when the Commonwealth
Government craft stupidly named Fordsdale
attempted to start its maiden voyage from
Sydney recently, an “acting” official, of
foreign name and birth, lodged an ultimatum
that his union would select the crew by bal-
lot. The management objected, just as a
bachelor might if told that he must marry
the senior girl on the waiting list, or the
one who drew the winning number, or else
not sail on the sea of matrimony at all.
There was no vestige of legal right behind
the demand, but all the same the vessel pro-
ceeded to lose £2OO per day in idleness, and
the idea of taking cargo from Sydney was
abandoned. Presently capable seamen who
wore weary of the bumptious tyranny of their
non-sea-going bureaucrats began to sign on,
despite the threat of Karl Somebody, the
official of foreign name and birth, that they
would be “dealt with”—fined or expelled or
something. The victory, assuming that it
isn’t blighted by subsequent happenings at
some wayside port, leaves a trifle to be de-
sired. There is apparently no hope of collect-
ing the cost of the action from the gentleman
of foreign name and birth, and he gains some,
scrap of victory in having sent the ship away
practically empty. The claim of the union
bosses to man vessels with persons chosen by
their methods isn’t abandoned, and if if was
the abandonment might prove worth very
little unless accompanied by hostages or a
cash deposit. Further, if the Government
doesn’t know how to prevent men being
“dealt with” —possibly fined or disqualified—
for legally joining its own ship, then it will
wear a flabby and unsatisfactory aspect for
the rest of its days. There are responsi-
bilities in being a Government, with all the
forces and assets of the country at com-
mand, and one is the responsibility of being
stronger than a private concern, which can’t
legally mobilise even the office bov.

Harwell Goes Too.
The Barwell Government, which came into
office in South Aus. on April 8, 1920, was
bluntly informed on Saturday that the elec-
tors had no further use for it. As in West-
ralia last month, there was no remarkable
increase in the Labor vote, but the stupidity
of the Government in not passing an elec-
toral-reform measure when the numbers were
available in both Houses has, in each ease,
enabled the Labor party to gain an exces-
sive number of seats, and thus to take offi’ce.
As a result of Mitchell’s neglect to pass
a Redistribution Bill six Labor members, re-
presenting a party vote of not 8000 alto-
gether, were presented with pocket-boroughs,
although 2815 Nationalists were unable to
secure representation in one metropolitan
constituency and 2708 in another. Bak-
well’s refusal to adopt preferential voting,
with single seats, was prompted by a churlish
hostility to the Country party, which
he was bent on destroying. His tactics have
certainly damaged that party, which found
the first-past-the-post system a handicap too
formidable in electorates contested by the
older parties, but they injured his own
party more. For instance, 5000 Liberal
votes in North Adelaide, a constitu-
ency with two seats, were insufficient
to elect a member, and it is not
certain at the moment whether 10,000 will
secure one of the three seats in East Torrens
-—the other two are definitely lost. On the
other hand 4000 Labor votes, or less, will
apparently suffice to return one man in
Wooroora, two each in Murray and Barossa
and three in Burra Burra: had preferential
voting obtained at least three of these pros-
pective members would have had no chance.
The Premier’s personal vote slumped signiti-
THE CHARITY BRIDGE.
COUNCILLOE ST RAW-IN-THE-H EAD: “That’s our famous 'bridge, mister, built and main-

cantly in Stanley, for which district he has
sat since 1915. What damaged his party
most during the campaign was his attitude
to the White Australia policy. In fact, the
election shows clearly (and the fatuous
Charlton should take warning from it)
that Australians will accept the leadership
of no man who suggests modifications of the
White Australia policy or an unwillingness
to defend it.
—
An anomalous situation arose from the recent
prosecution of one of Sydney's big residen-
tial hotels for trading after hours. The
police had found some patrons of the place
drinking with their evening meal, though
certain members of the party were not resi-
dents. In theory, of course, no one can have
a drink in a N. S. Wales hotel after t 5
o'clock unless he is living there. In theory
also no one _ may pay for a drink in the
clubs to which the Premier, Messrs. Ley,
Bavin and other Ministerialists belong
after 6 without laying himself open to a
police prosecution. Of late years, however,
such provisoes have been as dead for prac-
tical purposes as those 17th-century Acts
which were revived in England a dozen years
ago to harass Sunday traders. The Legisla-
tures could never have intended to put the
beer-dive or gin-shop (establishments which
are intended and used for drinking—hard
drinking—only) on a par with eating-places,
most of whose customers only consume drink
with their meals, and in moderate quantities
at that. In any event that is how the com-
munity reasoned, and for a long time now
some of the best citizens in the land —includ-
ing Federal and State Judges and Gover-
nors—have taken alcohol with their . meals
after hours in hotels and clubs irrespective
of whether they happened to be sleeping
where they dined. Bearing these facts in
mind, the Crown did the reasonable thing
in the case of the Carlton Hotel, and de-
cided that a conviction should not be re-
corded against the licensee. But this merely
amounts to temporising with an impossible
state of affairs. And meantime, the anomaly is
producing evil consequences of a severely
practical sort. The liability to forfeiture
of license tends_ to drive diners out of hotels
into places which have no license to lose.
This leads to sly-grog selling of the most
pernicious sort. And it does more than that.
It teuds to reduce, or, at any rate, limit, the
number and quality of hotels offering accom-
modation for travellers and other lodgers;
and that is quite a serious social matter.
Now that Sydney .seems on the eve of getting
its crematorium, the man who has fought
longest and hardest for it deserves a word.
This is Dr. Ckeed, now a veteran, whose
advocacy has never slackened since he was
a young man. Melbourne and Adelaide got
crematoria long ago; even in Westralia you
can have the business done at the Quaran-
tine station. In Wellington (M.L.) they
run it as a municipal enterprise. At pre-
sent the nearest furnace for the Sydney man
is at Melbourne, and it will cost his be-
reaved relatives about £lOO to patronise it
—not counting the urn. According to Dr.
Creed the business could be done in Sydney
for £2 up, and in these days of 11.C.L. a
little L.C.D. would be acceptable. The cre-
mationists have all the sane commonsense
of the community with them, and if there is
any further opposition to the scheme' the
course they took in Bologna, some years
ago, would soon destroy it. A body was ex-
humed a few months after burial and ex-
hibited to the public. Over 30,000 folk filed
past it. After that Bologna went the whole
hog for cremation.
Capricorn' : Queensland’s “developmen-
tal policy is strongly suspected of chasing
more people off the land than it puts on;
and as there were 14.5 acres under
crop per 10 head of population in
1014, and only 10.6 acres for the
same number last year, there appear to
be grounds for the suspicion. This result
has been arrived at in spite of the boom in
cotton lands. Simultaneously, the collec-
tion of land revenue and tax has been
colossal, springing nimbly from 335. Bd. per
square mile of occupied land in 1914 to
645. 3d. last year, the remarkable feat hav-
ing been made possible by (1) hard levying
and (2) there being 30-odd million less occu-
pied acres to levy on. This is what has
happened:—
Occupied Acres.

Queensland’s calamity is that the only cap-
able men in sight have flogged her to the
brink of bankruptcy, and there does not
appear to be anyone on hand to render first
aid.
♦
“Cartot” : The article on “Our Fatal Heri-
tage” (B. 27/3/’24) suggests a word on
another class of private hospital. Through-
out Australia, and especially in country
towns, there are hundreds of places which
call themselves “maternity homes,” many of
them positive menaces. Often their pro-
prietresses possess but the scantiest know-
ledge of obstetrics and gynaecology, or even
of tlm first principles of asepsis and surgical
cleanliness in childbirth. In the smaller
country towns the expectant mother is fre-
quently compelled to make use of these
establishments ; the expense of private hos-
pitals in inland centres, where they exist,
is too often prohibitive, whereas the Sairey
Gamp kind of establishment will sometimes
receive inmates at a tariff, exclusive of medi-
cal attendance, as low r as six shillings a day.
And here are laid the seeds of diseases and
troubles that may be lifelong. Yet in the
same country town there may be. and pro-
bably is, a first-class public hospital, which,
by a stupid provision of the N. S. Wales
law r , is not required to accept maternity
eases. Of course, not all country maternity
homes are of the sort indicated, but a strik-
ingly large number are. The Country
Women’s Association deserves the thanks of
every bush mother for the efforts it is making
to have public hospitals opened to expectant
mothers.

“Loco” : What I want to know is why can’t
speedometers with automatic pencil-marked
charts be attached to motor-cars and motor-
bikes? They are fixed to all up-to-date loco-
motives. The driver (I know, I’m one of
them) can’t exceed the speed limit, drop be-
low it, or stop between stations without a
“Please explain” following the next scrutiny
of his chart. A similar chart on motor-
veh icles would obviate a lot of the present
law-court arguments between drivers and
police constables; and the knowledge that
no amount of swearing would get him out
of his trouble would make the road-hog care-
ful—the chart might even hang him in cer-
tain circumstances. Of course provision
would have to be made for a heavy fine,
coupled with a black mark on a man’s
license, for not having the instrument in
order; but if a man will use a machine
which, mishandled, is a grave public danger,
he must put up with a small thing like that.

“Aerial” : A zone system of charges for
telegrams is long overdue. An alleged sys-
tem under which it is cheaper to telegraph
from Albury to Tibooburra (N.S.W.), 1000
miles, via Sydney and Dubbo, involving six
handlings of the message, than across the
Murray to Wodonga, three miles, direct
communication, is too ridiculous even for
comic opera. Here’s a simple zone system:
To places within 50 miles air-line, ignoring
State boundaries, Is.; elsewhere in a
State, Is. 3d.; inter-State, Is, 6d. —16 words
in each case. The present inter-State rate
is Is. 4d.; but the slight increase proposed
is more than offset by the recent extension
of the lettergram service (30 words, Is. 3d.)
to business matters. Anyway, Australian
telegraph charges are far the cheapest in
the world, particularly when the immense
distances are considered. The American
zone system works out at about 4s. per 1000
miles, with a high minimum charge, so that
a telegram to the neighboring town costs
there as much as a wire from Cairns to
Perth does here. And, in spite of alleged
Yankee efficiency, the service is poor com-
pared with ours. Some years ago the U.S.
Government had to step in to compel the
telegraph cos. to put the time and date
lodged on messages. Previously the receiver
of a wire didn’t know whether it had been
lodged that day or the week before last,
and among operators it was common know-
ledge that sheaves of private telegrams were
posted to the office of delivery.

POLTTICAL
POINTS
The riotous increase of Customs revenue
goes on, and in the nine months to March
111 the Treasury collected £2,181,407 more
of its own paper money than in the parallel
period last year. This represents a remark-
able increase in the importation of foreign
goods that have to be paid for with real
money, and a corresponding decrease in the
chances for local industry. The woollen in-
dustry should have a show here if anything
has, but even the Sydney Telegraph stated
recently that “few, if any, mills are working
their full capacity; one mill has stopped
its night shift; in another 20 per cent, of
the looms are idle, and in a third 40 per
cent.” The brandy artists complain that
their last crop is largely unsold, and unless
they get further Protection against coun-
tries with cheap labor and cheap currencies
the next one will be likewise. More Pro-
tection is promised—just the smallest
amount that seems likely to meet the case,
for there is always a morbid fear of giving
too much. But really it is doubtful whether
any amount of Protection will answer so
long as the foreign-borrowing madness con-
tinues. The loans have to come here in
some form, and they certainly can’t come in
money.
The British Government has definitely
turned tail now on its “levy on capital’
nebulosity—the one on which it fought the
general election. They will begin to call it
Hie Ranaway Macdonald Ministry soon.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Though an improvement in most ways, the Bruee-
Page Government strongly resembles its predecessor
in its craze for appointing Commissions, The latest
is a Commission of three to supervise building opera-
tions, disposal of allotments, and other things at
Canberra. The chairman will get £3OOO p.a. for
five years and his colleagues £2OOO each, one for
four years and the other for three, and, as provision
is made for additional terms of three years in every
case, the billets will be worth having. However,
the Government won’t pass the Bill without some
comment from its own side of the House. The
mounting expenditure on Chapman’s dream-city is
extorting protests from Ministerialists who are quite
tame on other subjects.
At the lunch given to him by the British
Labor party, Theodore complained that
Labor had to fight “misrepresentations
which frequently took the form of horribly
distorted forecasts of impending disasters.”
Doubtless that was what the whole-hoggers
at the Brisbane Conference ruminated in 1921
when Theodore was predicting the fall of
Labor if the socialisation objective should be
adopted. But when the objective had been
carried, who so compliant with it as Tlieo-
dore? What most damnifies Labor is not
the distortions of outsiders, but the contor-
tions of insiders, who will throw any kind
of back somersault to get or keep good politi-
cal jobs.
Certain English folk, sublimely cheeky,
lately appealed to the Macdonald Govern-
ment to speak to Australia about its deci-
sion to build .14 locomotives locally, when
imported machines were offered £30,000
cheaper. Whether the Government w r as fool-
ish enough to speak doesn’t appear, but the
usually torpid High Commissioner Cook was
moved to conversation. He made it known
that the low foreign tender, which would
have been accepted if importation had been
decided on, wasn’t British at all, but came
from one of J. Bull’s enterprising foreign
rivals.
“If Prohibition will get rid of slumdom and
poverty, as is claimed, it is worth trying,”
said the president of the Sydney Business
Men’s Efficiency League at a reception to the
efficient and business-like evangelist Bieder-
wolf. Certainly. But maybe prohibition
isn’t everything. Mohammedan countries
have had it for a thousand years, and the
cities still fall short of perfection.
The Rambling Mac Government struck
two submerged wrecks on one recent night,
and went on its way just the same. It
brought up the almost forgotten question of
the “levy on capital” which was to produce
three thousand million pounds. On the
abstruse question the House said, by 325
votes to 160, that the scheme was rot. The
Cabinet avoided another disastrous division'
by dropping the bill by which every un-
employed tenant was to stay in his house
rent-free so Jong as he remained unemployed,
no matter what his means might be. Min-
ister Wheatley, the Communist from Glas-
gow, who goes whole-hoggedly on the gospel
which the Moscow Government began to
weaken on in 1921, was the father of the
No-Rent measure. Other Ministers let him
do things like that to keep the Communist
vote behind the Government.
STARTLING THE NATIVES.
“Mr. Lawson is actively wooing the farmers. Alien the State Governor and Senator Pearce left the
Agricultural Convention on April I, the Premier stayed behind and spent a couple of days moving among
the delegates, who include some of the most influential farmers in Victoria.”
THE FLASH CITY BLOKE: “ Here, cash this, Bung. Come on, bogs, the drinks are all
on me."
HOTELKEEPER: “What about some real money ? We’ve been caught with crook cheques
’ere before.”
No one, of course, can defend breach of
contracts ; but the trouble that has occurred
tion” Act would have been avoided if the
people who have made most of the noise had
in connection with Queensland’s “Repudia-
been content to let the contracts stand as
they were originally made. No sooner, however,
does a man get a contract of any sort with
the State than, about three times out of
four, he starts pulling strings to obtain some
variation or other; and, of course, the varia-
tion is generally a concession. And the prac-
tice is more common in connection with land
than perhaps anything else, chiefly because
few members really know anything about
the land laws and are ready to oblige a Min-
ister or a member who wants an amend-
ment, on the broad principle that they may
want something themselves some day. The
Queensland trouble, at its inception, is about
equally a reflection on Parliaments and squat-
ters. And squatters are no worse and no
better in this regard than selectors; only
the selectors don’t as a rule pull strings so
well.
“Country Ped” on some neighbors:—
The other day a couple went before the Anglican
clergyman in this district, desiring him to marry
them. The girl is a poor thing, weak of intellect,
and the mother of a child by a Chinaman; the
character of her chosen mate may be inferred from
thisp Quite rightly the clergyman refused the
sanction of the church to such a union, but another
parson obliged. The rev. gent, may of course have
reasoned that such a woman will bear children,
married or not, and that it is better they should be
legitimate. The real blame rests with our slow-
moving, illogical, and frightened Governments, which,
criminally careless, refuse to make laws segregating
mental deficients.
According to the Daily Herald, which
represents British Labor and the fiscal policy
thereof, “London, owing to the widespread
poverty and distress, has become the world’s
shabbiest city.” That is something to say
for the great capital of Freetrade,
Theodore has said in London that “no
sane man or woman in London would aban-
don the White Australia policy, whatever
the consequences.” That is so; still there
have been some alarming symptoms of in-
sanity among the Communists who are try-
ing to capture the N. S. Wales A.L.P., and
among Federal Labor members.
Having swallowed two camels, Vic. Pre-
mier Lawson is straining at a gnat. Within
the last three years he has added £2OO a
year to the pay of each member of the
Assembly, and provided £2OO a year each
for previously unpaid members of the Uppah
Chamber —£19,800 in all. Now he is hesi-
tating to add four members to the Assembly
roll of 65, to increase metropolitan repre-
sentation. because it would mean another
£2OOO a year (.£5OO each). Country mem-
bers of the Cabinet are afraid to give up
more than one of the 44 provincial seats,
and the other expedient—of increasing the
total—is put forward. Even Kyabrama-
pootra, the provincials argue, accepted the
Irvine compromise of 68 seats 21 years ago.
Three were given up when Bent induced
Parliament to repeal separate representation
for State employees. It looks as if Law-
son will have to digest the gnat.
A curious result of the rumpus in the
Westralian Country party is that Col.-Sec.
Sampson, Angelo, Denton and Charles
Maley, whom the Primary Producers’ Asso-
ciation refused to endorse as Cockies, have
all boon returned. On the other hand, dis-
aster has befallen llarry Maley (Minister
of Agriculture and Cocky leader at the time),
Harrison, Hickmott, I’iesse and Jock Thom-
son. who took up the cudgels for the expelled
quartette; moreover, the seats of Scaddan,
Minister of Railways, and Broun, a former
Minister, who espoused the same cause but
didn't stand for re-election, have been lost.
Since the Ministerial Cockies have dwindled
from 15 to 7, while the anti-Ministerial
Cockies have increased from three to six,
the latter have had the better of the argu-
ment ; but both factions have received a
plain warning to compose their differences
and build up their party anew.
Before Theodore arrived at an understand-
ing with the London financiers he got a lot
of advice from the A.W.U. press. One
sample:—
The loan system was not made by Theodore, nor
fostered by the Labor party ; it is simply a legacy
from the Tories. In extremity, Theodore would be
morally right in saying that if the credit called a
loan which he requires is not granted, no more
payments of interest will be made. Queensland would
suffer nothing under such an arrangement, though
the Tory outcry might rend the sky.
If these are the A.W.U.'s convictions, it
should have the courage of them, putting
them to the test in its relations with the
Commonwealth Bank, where it lias a big
overdraft. The results would be thrilling.
The Rev. R. B. Hammond and Ernest
Wunderlich have been engaging in a con-
troversy on the liquor question. This was
the Prohibitionist's star argument: —
If prohibition is tyranny, then all prohibitive laws
are tyranny. Mr. Wunderlich may be the most care-
ful driver in Sydney, but if he tries, ever so eare-
fullv, to drive his car towards the quay along !'1 te-
st rcet the traffic police will certainly interfere with
his personal liberty, and by an act of tyrannical force
compel him to drive in the other direction—and
Mr. Wunderlich does not object. Prohibition is
just such a safety-first device.
Of course, Ernest Wunderlich doesn't object
to be regulated. No sensible man does. But
lit 1 would kick if he was told he mustn’t use
a motor-car at all; and that is what the
Prohibitionist tells him. Hammond himself
might kick if he was told that he mustn’t use
ink; and God knows harm enough has been
done in the world by ink —far more than
by wine!
There is to be more reform in Tie. gaols.
Argyle. the new Chief Sec., and Akeroyd.
the new Inspector-General, are keen on get-
ting the staff out of the primitive rut in
which it has moved. Proposals for Cabinet
sanction include the training of warders, the
intelligent classification of prisoners, open-
air work for first-offenders, an up-to-date
workshop, and a 48-hour week for warders,
who now work 5G hours. It won’t be so
easy to stall off Argyle as it was Baird, and
indications are that something will be done.
Referring to the British “protest” against
tin' Commonwealth Government’s acceptance
of an Australian tender for locomotives at a
higher price than a foreign tender, High
Commissioner Cook mentioned something
that J. Freetrade Bull is apt to forget—that
Australia is his fourth-best customer (and
in proportion to population his best by
hundreds per cent.), in virtue of a
stupendous act of goodwill which has cost
this country as much as 8f millions in one
year for lost customs revenue. If Australia
adopted Freetrade, or made its duties the
same to everybody, the Jap and the Yank
would take Jno. Bull’s trade in large quan-
tities. And there are people here who would
care less than before if they did take it, now
that British pacifism consists of arming liber-
ally for the defence of Britain and scuttling
out of the Pacific.
“Lex” : In Melbourne a few days ago a ruffian
who had tortured a foal was fined £lO. It
is significant that these offences are gener-
ally perpetrated on the most harmless of
animals. One never hears of a bull or a
bulldog being cut to pieces. A probable
reason is that the majority of animal-tor-
turers are graduating for that school of crime
which is the despair of alienists: if allowed
to go on agonising spaniels, calves, etc., they
will presently take to ill-using or killing
small children, girls and weakly women. Let
the police show vigilance in respect of
cruelty to animals, and let the punishment
in every serious case be not less than three
months’ hard labor, and Australia should
soon be a far safer place for unprotected
youngsters, male and female, than it is.
Impersonation as a line art: —
A friend of mine left Australia for foreign parts
just after his name had been placed on both State
and Commonwealth rolls. He remained away for
nearly seven years. Shortly after his return —his
address was the same as before—a political can-
vasser called to see him about an impending election.
The canvasser, being new to the game, began by re-
ferring to the other’s valued support at previous
contests. As he represented a party to which the
prospective voter was opposed, the latter naturally
repudiated the suggestion. Thereupon the caller pro-
duced a list containing his name as having voted at
two elections held during his absence. Further
investigation disclosed that he had been enrolled all
the time he had been away, and that on each occasion
somebody had recorded a vote in his name. There
is a vague belief that fraud, impersonation and other
genial practices of the Tammany tough are confined
to pre-selections, but one can’t help being incredulous.
“PROFOUNDLY GRATIFIED.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Theodore said he was profoundly gratified
with the success of his negotiations.”— Cable.
They might have been implacable. They might
Have made me shroud myself in sheet of white
And penitently stand
Long strings of Mea Culpas to recite,
A taper in my hand.
Or “You must come to us,” they might have said,
“In sackcloth garbed, with ashes on your head.”
No such vindictive methods they applied.
To stipulate they merely were content
The terms on which the money would be lent.
A beggar cannot choose ; so forth 1 went
Profoundly gratified.
With sinking feeling in my diaphragm
I might have heard the pawnshop portals slam,
While from behind the door
There came a jeering voice; “Try Uncle Sam,
Same as you did before.”
But no. They spoke me courteously and fair,
They didn’t eye me with a hostile stare
Or comment on the toughness of my hide;
They only put me wise to what to do
Before they would accept my I O IT,
And with the information I withdrew
Profoundly gratified.
Not like the Labor lion of other days,
Roaring defiance with his eyes ablaze,
I faced the banker class.
The brass had fled my brow. I had to raise
The other sort of brass.
Subdued I took my gruel and, forbye,
A most substantial wedge of humble pie
I placed myself determinedly outside.
So having grasped at last the fact that they
May claim to call the tune who have to pay
The piper, swallowing hard, I came away,
Profoundly gratified.

‘Expenses include dividends to shareholders:
1920, £9359; 1921, £49,918.
The A.P.A. spent itB twelfth year on the
penitents’ form, a new Board and founder
Selby Wood having endeavored to effect
a recovery from troubles which had
necessitated writing off altogether £158,35b
from reserves and funds. The spring-
cleaning began too late in the finan-
cial year to allow the latest accounts to
show the full extent of the savings effected
by the re-organisation. For instance, the
costly experiment in fire and marine under-
writing was .not finally got rid of until
(>ctober 1, and nine months’ operations in
that section resulted in a net loss of £33,877.
In the life branch an office estimate claims
that £ 194,88(> of income was won in the
second half of the year, against £134,837 in
the first half, at an extra cost of only a few
hundreds.
How general (fire and marine) opera-
tions, as disclosed by the accounts, affected
the year’s figures is shown next:—
Income. Claims. Expenses. Surplus.
Life .. £329,719 £29,327 £135,592 £164,800
General.. 76,389 41,471 68,795 33,877*
Total .. £406,108 £70,798 £204,387 £130,923
Life income in that table does not include
£11,395 “premium adjustment” which has
been credited in the accounts as the result of
a decision to treat premiums due or overdue
on a less stringent basis than was adopted
by the directors in their cleansing 12 months
ago; and in the introductory table (but not
in these last calculations) £764 which has
dropped out of reserves lias been charged up
with exes. The closing'down of fire, marine and
general accident business was followed by the
sale of the South African branch, which had
proved too costly for the volume of assur-
ances written ; the Southern Cross bought it
for £3OOO cash. In the Life branch more
than half of the premium income was
absorbed by exes, in 1922; last year there
was an improvement to just over 40 p.c.
Renewal premiums amounted to £205,058,
and premiums on new policies (5505 assur-
ing £1,606,719) totalled £55,709. On the
reckoning that new business is 10 times
more costly than old, the renewals expense
rate was approximately 17.8 p.c., and the
new business cost 178 p.c. of the respective
premiums. If the management can effect a
further substantial improvement on these
costs, the A.P.A. can look with greater con-
fidence to future surpluses. Another trouble
has been very large lapses, forfeitures and
surrenders, no less than 11,860 policies for
more than 2| millions having been discon-
tinued in the two financial years 1921-22. The
wretched Gratuity-Bond arrangement, which
permitted the Digger to pay a couple of
years’ premiums and convert his Govern-
ment lOU into cash, no doubt accounted for
many of the lapses. The management an-
nounces that since the re-organisation much
lapsed business has been revived.
The life accounts for the 12 months showed
a surplus of income over outgo of £176,195,
and that, according to actuary Doyle, was
£53,537 more than was required for his re-
serve for liabilities accrued under policies
at December 31. The directors took £lO,OOO
for a “special reserve in excess of actuary’s
requirements,” making a total of £60,000 in
that account; and the balance went into a
general reserve account, which now totals
£45,238. Liabilities under policies are esti-
mated by the actuary on the assumptioh that
accumulated funds will continue to earn 4 p.c.,
which looks a safe expectancy for many
years. Older offices, which developed
big figures in low-interest times, con-
tinue to allow for funds earning only
3 p.c. or 3A p.c. So in interest calcula-
tions alone the A.P.A.’s valuations produce
immediate surpluses relatively larger than
those of other offices. Nevertheless,
the disclosure of a surplus of £53,537
over actuarial requirements, even on a 4
p.c. interest basis, is a stunning perform-
ance in the face of expenses having taken
two-fifths of all income, and of internal
troubles of the past couple of years.
Another vital factor helping to produce sur-
pluses, however, is the method adopted of
allowing for early expenses in valuations.
The A.I*.A. applies the Sprague method,
by which the early high costs are
spread over practically the whole actuarial
life of policies. By thus deferring
the charging up of costs which have
been paid out in solid cash, the A.P.A.
is enabled to show larger actuarial surpluses.
To an extent this policy is justifiable; no
young office would look healthy to either
policyholders or shareholders if it estimated
liabilities on the pure net-premium basis of
valuation applied by older offices, whose
volumes of new business in relation to re-
newals are small. Provided little or no cash,
in the form of bonuses drawn by policy-
holders or divs. on capital, leaves an office
which inflates its surpluses in the expec-
tancy of recovering its early outlay in the
years to come, the practice amounts to
nothing more than book entries.
At the annual meeting last week the direc-
tors recommended—and, of course, share-
holders readily approved—the payment of
an S p.c. div. This will take approximately
*20,000, payable not out: of last year’s
earnings, but in anticipation of the current
year’s performances, based on only three
months’ figures! To distribute a div. in
anticipation of profits is, of course, quite un-
sound. Moreover, the position of the A.P.A.
as disclosed by its latest accounts gives no
justification for a div. The fire, marine and
accident experiment is shown to have cost
£83,489; it is charged to an “establishment”
account, but as the foundations, establish-
ment and all else have gone, some
tens of thousands can honestly be regarded
only as deficit at Profit and Loss which must
be erased or recovered before genuine profits
can possibly show up. In other businesses no
management would dare to recommend a div.
until such a deficit had been expunged either
out of profits or by writing down capital.
The co. which purchased the general insur-
ance business will, the A.P.A. management
expects, pay £40.000 commission in five years
on the business transferred, and perhaps con-
tribute a little more afterwards on business
which the A.P.A. hopes to put in its way.
The balance of the general insurance deficit
will be a charge, so the office says, on profits
expected from its own accident business. The
new directors are banking far too much on
problematical future earnings.
The div. was. however, apparently not
prompted by book surpluses already disclosed
or by the anticipation of profits. The
8 p.c. is nothing more than a device
to regain the goodwill of shareholders. When
the A.P.A. appeared to be in serious trouble,
its own shareholders, some of whom had paid
premiums of 100 p.c. and more for their
scrip, became its most bitter enemies;
many who held policies immediately lapsed
them. During the past 12 months efforts
have been made —with much success, too —to
regain their confidence. The A.P.A. Board
considers the 8 p.c. div. as the clinching argu-
ment in its campaign among proprietors, and
regards it rather as money spent to win back
goodwill and pave the way to further busi-
ness. The best that can be said for this is
that the end may justify the means.
Accumulated policy-reserves backed by the
balance of shareholders’ capital intact makes
the position thoroughly secure so far as
policyholders are concerned. By careful man-
agement and sound weighing of risks the
A.P.A. still has a good chance of developing
into a satisfactory life office. It might be
made better if one or two policyholders with
a sound knowledge of life business, and who
are not shareholders, were invited to join the
Board. That would be an innovation for a
proprietary office well worth considering; giv-
ing policyholders trustee representation, if
nothing more, would at least create confi-
dence. So far as shareholders are concerned,
the fire and marine deficit and the £50.000
charged to life establishment are together
equal to two-fifths of paid capital. That cal-
culation does not take into account the stiff
premiums paid on some of the shares and
practically the whole of which have gone.
Assets at December 31 included: Public
securities, £733,812; properties, £191,489
(£57.311 owing on mortgages) ; loans on
policies and mortgages. £117,063; cash,
£11,913; book debts, £35,295; outstanding
premiums, £36,251: interest accrued.
£12,340; agents’ balances, £23,896; and
office furniture, £10,715. Liabilities, apart
from mortgages, and mostly incurred to buy
gilt-edged securities, totalled £178,228.
Yellow Cabs of Australia, Ltd. —This
co., whicli is sponsored chiefly by P. W.
Tewksbury, of Vic. alluvial-gold fame, and
It. C. Dixson, of the Dixson Trust (Sydney),
had been registered with a nominal capital
in a half-million fl shares, and is inviting
subscriptions for 159,010 of them. Promoter
Tewksbury has closely investigated hire-car
services throughput the world, and lie con-
siders that Melbourne offers an excellent
opportunity for establishing an efficiently
organised, low-tariff service. The paid capi-
tal proposed is considered adequate to place
200 cabs in commission. These will be of
standardised type, and the service generally
is to be organised on lines which have proved
remunerative in U.S. cities. A big reduc-
tion of fares is proposed from the beginning
to “bring a volume of work from that great
section of the public which is not prepared
to, •or cannot, pay the present charges.”
It is to be effected by making no charge
for empty-running, either before a passenger
lias been picked up or after dismissal. The
service is to be run on a cash basis, bad
debts incurred in the present credit system
having considerably influenced existing
charges. In their interesting prospectus, the
promoters go fully into details, though they
do not venture to estimate profits. The
earnings of similar cos. in cities of approxi-
mately the same size as Melbourne suggest
that the enterprise should be a success pro-
vided it is soundly organised at inauguration
and is efficiently managed at all times. The
float is clean. The only loading is an allot-
ment of 5000 fully-paids to the promoter;
and that allotment is not to be made until a
div. at the rate of 10 p.c. or more has been
paid. The co. is also committed to paying
brokerage of Is. 2d. per share to under-
writers of not less than 10,000 shares prior
to the issue of the prospectus, and 9d. per
share for the same minimum underwriting
since the prospectus was issued. The pro-
moter has the right to take up 40,000
shares at par within five years. Shareholders
in the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Co.
(Chicago) have applied for 80,000 shares.
The Royal Blue Service (Melbourne) is to
be offered 40,000 shares for its business,
that allotment equalling the cash put in by
the proprietors, three of whom are on the
Yellow Cab Board. If the Melbourne enter-
prise is a success, the co. proposes to estab-
lish similar services in other capital cities.

Howard Smith's was at one time almost
exclusively a shipping concern • nowadays it
is merely the principal or only shareholder in
other cos. which own ships and coal-mines.
In 1912 the fleet was sold to a subsidiary,
Australian Steamships, Ltd., which published
accounts for a couple off years and then
became dumb. Coal interests are princi-
pally in Caledonian Collieries, Ltd., a co.
which runs splendidly equipped mines on
the Maitland field, and which publishes ac-
counts annually because there are share-
holders outside Howard Smith's. The parent
co.’s income is made up mostly of divs. from
the steamship and colliery cos.—perhaps a
little is also derived from other cos. not
specified in the total of £2,484,940 book
value of shares held; —and it makes a bit
as managing-agent for subsidiaries and
for others, like the Invincible Colliery
(Western N. S. Wales coalfield), which have
come more or less under its control. The
extent by which disclosed earnings are helped
by the various interests is not explained: all
the shareholder is told is that, after deduct-
ing all exes., £189,410 net was harvested last
year. Only those on the inside know the
true earnings of the subsidiaries.
The net profit disclosed for the 12 months
to December 31 was £35,590 short of the
amount required for the usual 15 p.c. divs.,
so to pay that rate reserves were tapped for
the deficiency. The profit shown was the
smallest since 1915. Half a million of pref.
capital was returned in the 1922 financial
year, but, including special transfers from
the steamship subsidiary, in nine years
£629,526 of visible reserves have accumu-
lated. No explanation of the failure of
profits to provide the 15 p.c. div. is made in the
directors’report; but it was partly accounted
for by the absence of an interim distribution
from the Caledonian Collieries in September
last. The strike on the Maitland field cur-
tailed earnings not only of the collieries but
also of the steamers carrying the fuel to inter-
state ports. The directors also complain
that working costs of the steamers are oppres-
sive ; but as the Associated cos. control
•charges to the public the ship-owner has not
much to complain of on that score. Anyway,
the felling-off of profits disclosed by Howard
Smith s published accounts cannot be taken
too seriously, because in almost the same
breath in which they were announced the
directors mentioned their intention of issu-
ing a half-million of bonus scrip, giving
holders one new fully-paid ordinary for every
three now held. That surely is evidence that
the co. s profit-earning position and prospects
are more robust than the published accounts
are permitted to tell. The repayment of the
pref. capital in 1922 was also an intimation
that the Board-room saw the co.’s affairs in a
""fit very different from that reflected in the
published accounts. The relation of liabili-
ties to assets apart from properties, shares in
other cos., plant, etc., has altered in this
way:—
1921. 1922. 1923
Liquid assets . . £747,466 £375,004 £343,568
Liabilities . . 531,032 651,330 686,084
Liquid surplus , . £216,424 .
Excess liabilities £276,332 £342,516
At December 31 £304,300 was owing to de-
positors and £38.1,784 to other creditors; but
U is impossible to ascertain the extent to
which subsidiary cos. are represented in these
figures, or in the debtors entry on the other
side of the balance-sheet. It is not unlikely
that Australian Steamships is nursing big
liquid surpluses, won during the war boom,
which offset the parent co.’s indebtedness;
otherwise the cheap pref. capital (it carried
9 p.c.) would not have been returned. The
investor must, therefore, refuse to take the
Howard Smith figures as telling everything:
rather must he put his trust in the select five
at the wheel and judge the weather from such
indications as the impending issue of bonus
shares.

This _ big colliery co.—paid capital is
£1,487,894. and the management was work-
ing on £205,601 of bor rowed money on
January s—is5 —is mostly owned by Howard
Smith, Ltd., and is quite as reticent as its
foster-parent on the subject of earnings. No
Profit and Loss account is published, one
entry alone—on this occasion “Balance for
the year, £79,530" —giving so mueh of the
earnings as the directors, all from the
Howard-Smith stable, decide shall be re-
vealed. According to their figures, the work-
ing of the Greta seam—one of the show coal-
fields of the world- —by most modern methods
has been a disappointing business. Other
less efficiently-equipped collieries digging in-
ferior fuel have, according to their own
figures, earned net profits of from 3s. to ss.
per ton coal produced : the Caledonian con-
fesses to only Is. 7d. per ton for the 1922
financial year, and Is. 0.6 d. for the past 12
months. Last year’s returns were, of course,
affected by a four months’ strike. Actual
results throughout have probably been very
different from those disclosed; for years the
management lias been developing and equip-
ping new collieries, and there is hardly a
doubt that profits were drawn upon to assist
the new funds put up by shareholders. Be-
sides disclosed profits having been small in
relation to tonnages produced, since Howard
Smith’s took over from the Scottish crowd,
who were the principal shareholders when the
old co. was working the Borehole and Bur-
wood seams at Newcastle, the average div.
rate has been low. This may have been
partly due to the large amounts of capital
sunk in w r ork which had not become revenue-
producing, and in the earlier years of the
new co. it was to some extent affected by
the valuations placed on the properties when
they were taken into Howard Smith’s books:
they were so much in excess of the purchase
price that a clause was inserted in the
Articles absolving the directors from all lia-
bility or responsibility respecting the values
given them.

E. J. Gourley, YVestralia's Inspector of
Mines, after a look at the Kalgoorlie mines,
has come to the following conclusions: —
South Kalgurli: Big tpnnages of payable to high-
grade ore are visible at, 1600 ft. and 1700 ft. levels of
the main workings, and a lot of payable stuff is
showing at 1100 ft. in Morty’s workings. Last year’s
developments have added some years’ supplies for
the mill.
Lake View and Star: Considerable tonnage of pay-
able ore lately developed at the 1800 ft. and 2100 ft.
levels. Outlook generally bright.
Boulder Perseverance: Tributors still doing the
bulk of the mining and keeping the plant going.
Position generally very hopeful.
Associated; Recent underground work has been
ptiriuipally confined to 1500 ft. and 1600 ft. levels,
whole f.he shoots opeiied up ale narrow and short.
Contiiitiafibii of the lieh ore driven oil in the adjoin-
iii£ Solitli fcaigtirii shotiid be strhck above the
1600 ft. ievei.
Great Boulder; In numerous levels a large ptopot-
tion of the ore has been stoped out. If is finder-
stood that ore-breaking in the eo.’s newiy acquired
Hannan’s North Golden Zone leases, at the north eiid
of the field, will be started shortly.
Oroya Links: This co. now owns and works the
Kalgurli mine and plant, and its mill is kept busy
with ore broken by tributors there and in the Brown-
hill Oroya North blocks and by parcels from outside
mines. Croesus Proprietary section of the Oroya
Links appears to have a profitable future, provided
ore is selected and not taken over too great a width.
Golden Horseshoe: Developmental work principally
confined to the continuation of the Ivanhoe lode at
the 2900 ft. and .3000 ft. levels. Elsewhere operations
are mostly restricted to stoping.
Paringa: This co. is now searching for the down-
ward continuation of a lode from which several
thousand pounds worth of gold was won in shallow
ground.
North Kalgurli: Some time ago the Lake View and
Star unwatered this mine with a view to purchase,
but no deal has so far been made. The same applies
to two other leases adjoining on the north.
* * * *
Several State-subsidised prospectiug par-
ties have roamed the out-back Westralian
goldfiplds during the past two years, but
only one, the first led by Captain Jones,
pegged out anything of prospective value,
and that was not new. The parties arc gener-
ally out several months, and return with
nothing more than records of having pros-
pected promising belts without sighting pay-
able results; getting traces of alluvial gold
whose source could not be located ; or of pass-
ing through dry auriferous country which
could not be tested for want of water.
Sporadic State-aided gold hunts of this Sort
have invariably failed in other countries, too.
* * * *
Yilgarn, one of the oldest Westralian gold-
fields, is behaving well with new develop-
inents. A Kalgoorlie syndicate is giving the
huge Victoria lode a thorough trial with an
up-to-date plant, and results so far are pro-
mising, The recently-discovered lode in the
Salvation lease (Marvel Loch) has furnished
300 tons for all ounce average; a new belt
five miles south-east of Bullfinch has given
high-grade surface prospects; and a number
of other discoveries have been made on the
main Yilgarn line of country. The unsatis-
factory feature of the field has been that
deposits do not go deep. However, most ore-
bodies go to 200 ft., and that satisfies the
average prospector.
* * * *
Devon (W.A.) is again seeking exemption
as a preliminary to taking round the hat.
The Bulletin has a clear recollection of
shareholders having been told at the last
meeting that the co.’s previous failure had
been due to mismanagement, and that as
control had passed into other hands larger
returns followed by divs. could be relied
upon. Something was also said about the
installation of a bigger battery and a wider
reef giving ounce results. Instead of divs.,
calls have been persistent. An examination
by an outside expert of both mine and plant
is still the Devon’s need.
* * * H
Brilliant (W.A.) has taken an option over
some “new find” at Yalgoo, and talk of a com-
ing boom has caused a little market activity
in its previously worthless scrip. At pre-
sent forfeited shares bought for a song are
being put out at about Is. There is gold on
the show optioned by the co., but Yalgoo
formations are notorious for becoming worth-
less at comparatively shallow depths. The
Retaliation group is a case in point. Gnow’s
Nest is doing better than most on the field,
but even it is doubtful at depth.
A new find on the east side of Kalgoorlie
is looking well. ,and already the down-
hearted people there are entertaining hopes
that it will mean better days. Notwith-
standing diligent search. Westralia has not
produced a big, payable ore-deposit since
Edna May was opened in 1911. The owners
of the Kalgoorlie field claim that they have
stfuch something out of the ordinary.
*
Brb’wii’s Relat'd Central (W, A.) intends
hauling the Meant Gibson battery 190 miles
across salt-bush plains tb its mine, which is
really an old abandoned Field's Find pro-
perty. When labor was less costly and min-
ing requisites were cheaper the Field’s Find
Co. worked down to 300 ft. and then gave' tip.
In the absence of fresh developments the
proposal to re-equip the property with a
treatment plant seems to be rather venture-
some.
* » » »
When Westralian Mines Minister Scaddan
gave a local man the right to forp a co. to
acquire the whole of the abandoned gold-
mining areas in the State (about 4000)
Parliament refused its endorsement. The
concessionaire then demanded compensation
but was mollified by a tentative offer of a
concession on a smaller scale. Cabinet, how-
ever, jibbed even at this, and now the
concessionaire threatens more trouble.
* * * *
In the last few weeks the Hercules mine,
Bendigo, has had an important develop-
ment. The cloud on this mine was the fail-
ure of the main - gold-shoot to materialise in
the 1380 ft. north level, where, having a north
pitch, its appearance was long overdue. How-
ever, on breaking the quartz on the east
side of the drive good gold was uncovered,
the missing shoot having evidently moved
Over from its usual track near the west wall
Of the 10ft, to 20ft. wide reef. This not
only brightens the outlook at 1380 ft.. but
points to the 1476 ft. shoot (last crushings
gave 21dwt. and 22dwt.) as its continuation,
with a 400 ft. gap of untried ground between.
A rise is to go up from the 1440 ft. level into
this gap, and should soon tell the tale. A
favorable verdict means at least a year's pro-
fitable work assured above the 1520 ft,. level.
It would also mean that the costly develop-
ment work from the 1520 ft. winze at 500 ft.
north should cease, as the stone can be won
at half the expense when the 1620 ft. drive
gets there, say, a year hence. The block of
ounce stone already developed supplies the
strongest inducement to push this level on,
apart from chances nearer the shaft. The
main 1620 ft. crosscut now going out should
reach the reef channel in about a month.
The co.’s position is sound. Plant has been
paid for, and with several thousands in
hand, the approaching necessity of buying
the Consols battery can be easily under-
taken.
* * * *
If some dead and gone pioneers could
return to Bendigo they would be looking
north of the Hercules for a string of mines
busily sinking for that show’s fine 1380 ft.
reef. But there’s nothing doing. The Her-
cules holds about tliree-fiftlis of a mile to
the north, and there is only one shaft in this
stretch, the Pearl East, half a mile away,
that could attempt the job. This is down
1000 ft., and is connected there with the
two Pearl shafts on the New Chum line.
Though the group is isolated, to bale out
the Pearl East and put in a masonry dam
at 1000 ft. would be, a costly work in
itself. The sinking for the Hercules reef
would mean another 1000 ft., but half-way
down the Ironbark and the Central Blue
reefs would be met. Moreover, the Coll-
mann’s cross-course is near, and all these
reefs might benefit from its enriching influ-
ence. The fair chance of a big reward in
such an undertaking should appeal to some
big-hearted men, or men with £25,000 to
splash up, but the last of that race died
some time ago. To tackle the reef by a
long crosscut from the adjoining line, as has
been done several times before, is out of
the question, as there is a wide divergence be-
tween the lines, and a 1200 ft. crosscut would be
necessary from the Windmill mine at a depth
now well under water. The Hercules must
look forward to lengthy north levels.
# * * *
Grand Junction, Maldon (Vic.), has de-
cided not to persevere further; prospects
generally have been encouraging, but yields
have failed to cover working exes. Machinery
and plant are to be sold and the directors
are investigating a tin-sluicing proposition
near Gladstone (Tas.), which the vendor
reckons goes a pound per yd. for an average
depth of 12ft.
* * * *
If Joe Reilly, at Aberfeldy’s Golden Lily
(Vic.), is right, that shoAv should bloom
soon. He says he has a shoot of gold-bear-
ing stone 112 ft. long, and from Ift. to sft.
wide in the western reef, and the middle
lode (14ft.) is going underfoot from the
old No. "2 tunnel. Reilly depends on the
second shoot a lot because it was worked
for 800 ft. by the old hands. But if it was
good stuff’, why didn’t they go underfoot?
The proving of the spurs recently located
in South Lucknow (N.S.W.) after several
years of dead work is proceeding steadily,
but so far there is no proof that either of
the formations will carry the bonanzas
which made the old field famous. The
winze is now' dowm 17ft. on the ore-body, and
stoping is giving the co. its first decent-
sized parcel for treatment. How values
average is not told; anyway, the quantity of
ore in sight is not of much consequence.
Everything depends on following and open-
ing up the spurs on the contact to see
whether present encouraging indications,
both as to size of gold-bearing material and
values, will make South Lucknow a sub-
stantial producer.
The Bodangora field. 30 miles from Dubbo
(N.S.W.), which produced 11 million gold
in former days, is being revived. A
Wellington-Dubbo syndicate is working what
is claimed to be a continuation of the old
Bodangora reef. A mile to the south-east
they have sunk 84ft. on a reef a foot, wide
carrying gold all the way. Half a mile away
an alluvial flat in the old Jawbone area is
being handled payably. Three miles further
on, another reef has been traced for three-
quarters of a mile, and one 4ft. pothole
shows free gold with iron pyrites giving
assays of more than an ounce.
* * * *
Dr. H. I. Jensen, formerly of the Northern
Teri'itory and then of the Queensland Geo-
logical Survey, is the latest to participate in
the argument as to whether Victoria has
any chance of winning petroleum. He has
examined the Glenelg River find for the South
Aus. Oilwells Co., and declares that there
is “a definite seepage and that the rocks
show clearly the anticlinal structure.” A
rotary drilling-plant is to get to work with-
out delay.
Geologist L. C. Ball’s latest report on
tests from the Lander bore at Orallo puts
a damper on the optimism that colored early
statements, including those of Mines Minis-
ter Jones. The latest analysis of drillings
show only extremely small bitumen percent-
ages. The washing of the samples showed
tiny fragments of shale and coaly sub-
stances, and that raises a geological doubt
as to the likelihood of the bitumen being
derived from petroleum. Ball thinks that
drips of lubricating oil from the machinery
are partly accountable for some of the slight
oil scum in the drain. The report is a very
guarded one. An unofficial report from
Orallo a fortnight back that a sand, looking
as good as anything on the Santa Fe
Springs field, in California, was waiting to
be tested made shareholders temporarily
happy. Results arc not expected for another
fortnight, an examination of the sands de-
pending on whether the re-cementing of the
bore proves successful.

The grant recently made by the Mines
Department to Clark’s Mines, Charters
Towers, assisted by calls, has not revealed
the promised shoots below the No. 11 level,
and pipes and rails have been taken out.
A little stoping is being done around No. 6,
and a small crushing, averaging about £lO
a ton, went through recently. Apparently
nothing can save the mine now from an
early closure except an unexpectedly lucky
strike. It is the last of the deeper mines on
the Towers, although it went only a little
over a third of the depth of the Brilliant
Extended, which stopped at 3030 ft.
* * * *
The Ortona field (N.Q.) looks to have a
future. It has been held back by the hold-
ing of the principal reefs in small claims
and by lack of crushing facilities. The
b' c t shows have now been amalgamated, and
a battery is to be erected. The Finger Print,
the best-looking reef, averages 2ft. to 3ft.
wide, with values up to Boz.. and it looks
good for a length of 500 ft. There are about
500 tons 2oz. ore at grass awaiting a mill.
The occurrence looks promising, as the reefs
are in fissures in slate with a big decom-
posed diorite dyke intersecting the country.
The first work under the new scheme will
be the sinking of a mainshaft on the Mona
claim. The present shaft is down 40ft., and
discloses a strong reef along the level for
80ft., varying from 6in. to 4ft. wide. Three
parallel reefs have been scratched on the
surface, and they offer possibilities.

Blair Athol coalfield (Q.) is still having
a hard struggle. No. 1 mine is not pro-
ducing at present; No. 2 worked only 10
days during February, and the Newcastle
only 11 days. The total output of the field
was 4897 tons for the month. In normal
times it was 15,000 tons. The Blair Athol
Coal Co. is raising further cash for opera-
tions on its open-cut.
No. 6 Argent (Tas.) is again seeking Gov-
ernment assistance to enable it to carry on.
Present-day mining operations in Zeehan are
mostly State-aided, and why the Speck Gov-
ernment continues to give away its badly-
needed cash to bolster this dead silver-lead
camp is hard to explain. In 1919 a grant of
£5OOO was given this co., and now it wants
another £5OOO to test the deposit to 160 ft.,
though Government officials consider that
£BOOO would be needed. When production
began in 1922 the co. w r on 963 tons of ore
worth £20.329 and then gave over the work-
ing to tributors, who removed 318 tons
before quitting the show in December, 1923.
It is usually safe to say that when tributors
are driven out of mine workings through
poorness of yields there is little chance of a
co. making a lift.

The Farrell Mining Co., which for years
has been hanging on to development
work at Tulla (Tas.), has taken over the old
Devon mine on the Cradle mountains, near
Devonport. A lead lode a foot wide has
been exposed, and is claimed to assay 73 p.c.
lead and 1420 z. silver.

Les Robinson's fable of the sandfly and
the eagle
“Look here, George,” said a sandfly to an eagle,
which was waiting for a pet lamb to be let off the
chain, “we should co-operate for mutual benefit.”
“nut, in spite of my supposed extraordinary vision,’
said the eagle, “I can’t even see you.”
“That will be all right, George,” murmured the
sandfly, ingratiatingly. “You leave it to me. When
I wish to draw your attention to anything, I shall
tickle you slightly where you cannot fail to become
aware of it.”
“Anything to please you, my dear invisible friend, ’
said the king of the air, with a good-natured grin
which he aad ueen at some pains to cultivate in order
to deceive the artless and get regular meals. “Al-
though,” he added, “I’m plucked if I can see where
the mutual benefit comes in.'
Before long, the sandfly, wishing to draw the
eagle’s attention to the state or the weather or
something, chose a very promising sore on the great
bird’s foot and settled down to a hearty meal;
whereupon the eagle, annoyed at the itch occasioned
by the insect’s voracity, bit the sore off, insect and
all.

The objective was neither glory nor the grave,

two of these gentry, and as usual they
agreed to enlist. The regiment entrained
at Port Elizabeth for Pretoria, and. m the
bustle, attestation was forgotten. VVhen we
had settled down the adjutant sent for the
two to be attested. Both of them blankly
refused, stating that as they had not been
signed up, they were liable to no penalty,
and would cheerfully do a short term in
Pretoria “tronk” for stowing away. J-lie
adjutant quoted the “King’s enemies clause,
but was told there had as yet been no
“firing” Present writer came on the scene
just as the R.S.M., an old Imperial service-
man, contributed his solution of the diffi-
culty “Hi am affraid, sir, tlunkm it hover,

away any of ’is Majesty’s property, sir. The

“Light Horse”: Campbelltown (N.S.W.)
has another distinction besides being the
place where the first Circuit Court in Aus-
tralia was held (B. 27/3/'24). In January,
1915, troops were “billeted on the. town,
and that was the first time such a thing
had happened in Australian history, ihe
idea was Colonel “Dicky Holman s, then
instructor of a Light Horse school at Liver-
pool. By way of a wind-up to the course,
he arranged for a staff ride through Camp-
bclltown and Narellan, billeting a “brigade
ir each town on successive nights. In
Britain and the Continent, billeting of
troops on civilians is provided for by law,
but there is no statutory authority m this
country for such a proceeding, wherefore the
officer decided to ask the townspeople if
they were willing to come at it voluntarily.
They were eager, and somehow or other
Dicky screwed the necessary payment
(under the English Act) out of the pay
wallahs. Proper billeting routine was car-
ried out, and Campbelltown and Narellan
seemed to get as much fun out of it as
we did. Most of them scoffed at the Is. Gd.
per diem allowance per soldier, or when they
took it put it in the Bed Cross boxes.

“F.E.T.” : I remember a Digger who nar-
rowly missed being invalided to England on
the strength of a pair of broken spectacles.
He was sent from the transport lines to be
fixed up with a new pair. The doctors were
particularly busy, and during the waiting
lie became mixed up with a crowd of shell-
shocks ; also, when he looked for his “diag-
nosis ticket” he couldn’t find it. The up-
shot of it was that he found himself being
treated for shell-shock and put on a light
diet for several days. His angry protesta-
tions and appeals for his new glasses were
treated as ravings; and when he finally tried
to run away from the hospital to rejoin his
unit lie was marked as a bad case, and was
labelled for Blighty. And thither he would
undoubtedly have gone if his ticket hadn't
turned up. It was found in the possession
of a dinkum shell-shock patient, who, in a
crazy moment, had pinched it while the
owner slept.

“M.D.” looks back a few years:—
N. S. Wales has just received a fresh batch of
medical graduates —110 this time. tsot a record
other years have given 150 ; but there is not that
serious diminution in numbers one would expect.
One doctor per 1000 inhabitants is considered a fair
average, out the populaticn docs not increase annually
by 112,000 or anything approaching it; so we are
absurdly over-doctored. The consequences are many
and serious. The overcrowding leads to unfair
methods of competition—a touting for patients in
some instances ; an unwholesome love for the knife ;
most important of all, a spirit of blatant com-
mercialism which makes one sigh for five-and-twenty
years ago, when there was a higher ethical standard,
and the patient’s wellbeing was the first consideration.
As Papini well says, “Money is a pitiless master.”
Read the newspapers and tot up the number of
fashionable appendixes that are removed from week
to week. A well-known surgeon, before his departure
for Wembley Park was so rushed with appendi-
cectomies that he was making £lOOO per week out of
this trifling surgical procedure. Also there is a
craze amcngst the newly-fledged for getting useful
teeth extracted. 1 know a case of undoubted brain
tumor who has had all his teeth and his appendix
removed. I wish these too enthusiastic members of

“Oh no, they’re not really engaged. But she says he’s got
an engagement ring in his voice every time he hisses her
good-night.”
the profession would read Sir Thomas Browne’s
“Religio Medici.” There they will find the saying
that “Every tooth is a diamond,” and it should be
pasted over the door of every dentist and doctor.
When one thinks that in 1899, after the Sydney
Medical School had been established for about 17
years, tnere were only 114 medical graduates, it
gives one a cold feeling down the spine to find that
this number has more than once been exceeded in a
single year. As for the inordinate love of operating,
even so long ago as that year 1899, Dr. R. Scot
Skirving, in a Presidential address at the Congress,
sounded a note of warning, remarking that an
operation was a great and sorrowful evil” ; and he
advocated a more intimate relation between physician
and surgeon. If there was a tendency to overdo
the thing in those far-off days what must be said
of the year of grace 1924 ? It is satisfactory to learn
that parents are becoming sensible of the absurdity
of sending their offspring to be trained for an over-
stocked profession, and the remarks of the new
Chairman of the R.P.A.H., Dr. Cecil Purser, that the
number of students has slumped from 250 in 1919
to 55 in 1924 will be relished by all persons dowered
with common sense,

distinctly nervous about her first day ot
teaching in the small ’wayback school. She
had heard so much of the rough speech
and customs of these strange country people.
Even the rude health of the youngsters
frightened her a little. But she was deter-
mined not to be unduly sensitive- So when,
to the usual query about his father’s occupa-
tion, an over-grown 10-year-old answered
in the curious, unaccented country drawl.
“Oh, Vs a bee-farmer,” she only said softly,
“I see. And what does he farm?”

“Crispie”: It didn’t always pay to take
advantage of the ignorance of one’s superiors
in the A.I.F. In 1916 a platoon of us, m
charge of a sub. who had not yet been under
fire, was sent to construct new support-
trenches to the left of Fleurbaix. We always
hated fatigues; so when, as we swung picks
and shovels, a few stray shells lobbed in the
vicinity, we “kidded” our raw lieutenant
that Fritz had located us and opened fire.
The officer at once ordered us to gather tools
and return to billets, and was sternly lectured
by the Battalion C.O. for his rawness and
credulity. Next morn, to make up for the
delay, we were up and working at daybreak.
A Hun ’plane, was scouting about, and very
soon the shells began to lob around us. This
time Fritz had located us, But it was use-
less telling our officer this; we had cried wolf
the day before, and he didn’t mean to fall in
twice. 1 So it wasn’t until five of us were
dead and 11 wounded that he realised some-
thing was really wrong and gave the order
to retire.
“Brud”: “777” (B. 13/3/ ! 24) is perfectly
right in liis assertion that the French “ace,”
Guynemer, received no funeral honors from
the Germans, or indeed from anyone. At the
time my squadron was working in the same
sector as Guynemer, and the general belief
throughout both services was that this top-
notch flier and his
"Spad” had had an
Archie all to them-
selves, and that
the only bit of evi-
dence left was the
number of the
llispano-Suiza en-
gine found half-
buried in the mud
near Poelcapelle.
In September,
1917, I got an
“issue” while low-
flying which made
me during the re-
mainder of the
war a guest of the
Kaiser. From in-
formation gained
in several prison
camps I am con-
vinced that Guyn-
cmer was blown
into fragments.
Flugspokt, the
German Aviation
Corps’ weekly
magazine, casually
mentioned a bout
September 15 that
Guynemer was re-
po rt e d by the
French as miss-
ing ; later, I be-
lieve the distin-
guished F rench
airman w a s
claimed by Rich-
tofen as his 33rd
victim! Guynemer
was a resourceful
inventor as well as
a great fighter. His
“Spad,” by the
way, was u con-
glomeration of
gadgets of liis own
design. Besides a
Vickers he had a
pom-pom firing a
shell weighing
about lib. through
the propeller, and a cinematograph working
automatically with the trigger-controls.
“Lex” : The idiotic convention that steal-
ing is not stealing where the article illegally
appropriated happens to be a costly motor-
car received a jolt in Sydney the other day
when a jury convicted a joy-rider, and the
Judge responded with a sentence of 18
months’ hard labor. For some reason the
doctrine of “recent possession” has not
hitherto been applied to car-tliieves. The
tendency has been to accept them as sport-
ing and rather heroic characters, with much
of the lovable playfulness which is the tra-
ditional property of the drunk. Whereas
a woman thief, who was found wearing a
purloined diamond necklace, would be prac-
tically certain of a conviction and stiff sen-
tence; (though the necklace might not have
been in any way injured), a man thief

you’ll he very happy with me. Besides
your wages you shall have all my dis-
carded frocks and hats.”
who was found in a valuable car which lie
had half ruined would be almost equally
certain of escape. There will be no altera-
tion in this inequitable state of affairs till
juries cease looking on the destruction or
partial destruction of expensive cars as high-
spiritedness of a pardonable, not to say
amusing, nature.
BUT AUTUMN
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spring fills the world with color’ and with life;
Summer is warm and full with fruit and wine ;
Winter is cold, sharp, clear, a shining knife ;
But Autumn comes on us without a sign.
A single leaf, by sonic chance current fanned,
Fell from the safety of its parent tree
And brushed my cheek. I could not understand
Why that dead leaf should chance to fall on me.
We feel the happy liberty of youth;
Life at the full has still the tang of wine ;
Old age brings resignation, teaches truth —•
But Autumn creeps on us without a sign.

“Robot”: Parties who seek the easy road
to divorce by a suit for restitution of con-
jugal rights may find it not so smooth as it
was beginning to look. The N. S. Wales Court
laid it down in Catts v. Catts that the sin-
cerity or otherwise of the petitioner in bring-
ing the suit did not affect his right to a
decree; the Court would only consider his
motive if it became relevant to the question
whether he had been guilty of conduct which
made matrimonial life impossible. But the
English Court of Appeal in Harnett v. Har-
nett has now decided that sincerity is very
material, even though the action is taken
with a view to further proceedings if the
order of the Court is not obeyed. In the

“But, madam , a woman of your age can’t expect to grow younger!”
“I’m not asking that , doctor. All I want you to do is to keep me
growing older a little longer."
past the one fear a petitioner had was that,
in writing the necessary letter to the respon-
dent to found the action, he might appear
to be so anxious for her return as to
soften the wayw-ard one’s heart. Now that
he has to appear more sincere than ever, the
action for restitution will probably not be
so popular. It is wickedly suggested that
to get over the difficulty the Courts should
agree on a common form of letter and so help
intending litigants in their trouble.
“C.G.C.” : I remember an exhilarating St.
Patrick’s Day at Port Said in 1918. O’Mal-
ley, a six-foot light horseman, and myself—
both A.W.L. —were celebrating the festival
at Maxim’s well-known cabaret. “Bottle of
whisky,” roared my cobber to the descendant
of Leonidas wiio
presided over the
glasses. “No, sar;
meeleetary orders,
sar. No can give
weesky. Only beer
and wine.” “All
right,” growled
O’Malley; “bring
ns 12 glasses of
beer and 12 glasses
o f wine.” The

gered for a
moment, bat pre-
sently reappeared
with a huge tray.

velopments. They
Were soon ( forth-
coming. After the
consignment ha d
been duly nego-
tiated, O’Malley
roared out another
order for whisky,
and the trembling
“suffrage” reiter-
ated his inability
to comply with it.
“D'yer see that

O’Malley, holding
titi a tumb 1 e r.
"Well, look ’ere”
: —and he bit out a
huge chunk of
glass and cracked
it up between his
teeth. The spec-
tacle nearly sent
the waiter into
hysterics. “Here,”
said O’Malley, spit-
ting out the broken
glass and holding up the jagged tumbler —
“if you don’t irnshi and bring that whisky
I'll eat you like that.” The w aiter jmshied!
“Hamer”: A leading light of the pro-
hibitionist legions in a Sydney suburb has
fallen off the water waggon with a rever-
berating thud. He was at one time a heavy
drinker, yet one of tlie type that insists on its
habit of behaving itself, no matter how sozzled
it may get. One
morning, however,
when he woke up
lie was asked to
survey the damage
of the night before
—s om e missing
clothes, his boots
and socks lying on
th e lawn we t
through. his false
teeth broken, a
few- ite m s of
smashed furniture,
and one of the
children with a
cut hand. Also
there was a mass
of language, darkly
hinted at. which
he was told he had
addressed to all
and sundry. The
offender was so
ashamed that he
signed the pledge
and plunged into
Cold Teaism. For
seven years lie
rode the waggon;
tlie li a family
quarrel led to an
exposure of the
trick that had been
played upon him.
Actually he had
come home quietly
and gone straight
to bed and to
sle e p ; but the
family, scandalised
a t his frequent
lapses, had thought
out. and staged
the frame-up that-
fooled him into
sobriety. Disgusted at the perfidy lie has re-
turned to his pots w r ith a vigor that has
filled a whole suburb with scandal.
“H.L.N.” : When day dawned on the tail-
end of the dance at Daley's farm that fol-
Ifwved Wombat Gully’s race-meeting, most
of the boys who were able to do it mounted
and beat it for home. Those more seriously
sozzled were sleeping it off in various cor-
ners. Dan Grady, always an unreasonable
man when in drink, would neither ride away
nor sleep; nor would he let others sleep. At
last, by rioting round trying to pick quar-
rels with slumbering men, and declaiming in
raw Australian to the tired womenfolk, he
drew upon himself the hostile notice of Con-
CHECKED.
"Now, honest, am I the first man you've ever really loved?"
"Perfectly true. I went over my whole list only this morning."
stable Fl.vnn. Warnings proved useless, and
Flynn began to think that it would be liis
unenviable job to convoy the fightable and
unwilling Dan to the nearest lockup, 12
miles away. Then he had an inspiration.
He got Dan on board his prad “to show the
ladies what a foine horseman he was, to be
sure.” Then he led the horse to a fruit-
tree and hitched the bridle over a broken
bough. Wagging his linger impressively
under the cavalier’s nose, lie said: “Dan
Grady, ye’ll mind that I hereby arrist ye
in the King’s name, an’ ye’ll just wait there
till I get me horse and take ye to the sta-
tion ; an’ I misdoubt if ye’ll get off under
£lO for what ye’ve done this day.”
Me then retired to the stable and lit
his pipe. The forcible utterance of the re-
presentative of law and order had evidently
penetrated Dan’s fuddled brain. He cast a
furtive glance over each shoulder, and.
gathering that the coast was clear, cau-
tiously reached out and lifted the bridle
off the branch. The next moment the clatter
of his horse’s flying hoofs resounded on the
cobblestones at the crossing; and Constable
Flynn, after a satisfied glance from the
stable-door, pulled three or four bags of
chaff together for a bed and promptly fell
asleep.

“Sehnorrer”: Old Jacob Mandelberg’s
pawnbrokery and second-hand; shop has been
a feature of the Castlereagli and Market
streets corner of Sydney for 35 years. The
venerable shack, which now has to make way
for David Jones’s new premises, contained
a wonderful collection of property that at
one time or another has been found pawn-
able. The proprietor was given notice to
quit months ago ; but. he clung on desperately,
and finally the exasperated contractors
descended on the premises, put barricades
around it, and posted notices that the place
was “closed by the contractors.” Then
they proceeded, commencing at the roof, to
tear the building down. Undismayed, Man-
delberg posted “Business as Usual” notices,
and. assisted by his five sons, knocked holes
in the palisades to permit of the continuance
of trade. When the ancient walls were
crumbling around him the uselessness as well
as the danger of further resistance became
apparent, and the garrison marched out,
finally managing to secure a day or two's
stay of demolition proceedings for the re-
moval of the spoils of over 30 years’ trad-
ing from the roofless tenement.
“Herodot” : Perhaps the strangest piece of
property ever recovered by a diver in Aus-
tralian waters was a coffin. A small steamer
bound from China for Thursday Island stuck
a reef and went dow n. Included in the cargo,
according to the Chinese at T. 1., was a coffin
containing the remains of a compatriot who
had died in one of the islands of the north-
western Pacific, and was on the w r ay back
to China. The upshot of it was that some
of the leading Chinese merchants of the port
approached a well-known diver and offered
him a very handsome fee to recover the coffin
in order that the bones of I'ong Wong, a
man of consequence, might rest in peace
upon ancestral soil. They offered, moreover,
to supply the schooner and necessary equip-
ment, and as the wrecked vessel was lying
in only six or seven fathoms the diver
promptly undertook the job. He made a
success of it, and three weeks later the
schooner arrived back in Thursday Island,
where the salvaged coffin was duly handed over
to the highly-appreciative Chinese. The only
thing that didn’t leak out at the time was
that the coffin recovered from the wreck
didn't go to China, although one very like it
did. The salvaged article held no corpse
its contents consisted entirely of opium.

“Centurion" : “Saaedi” asks for the reason
of the quickly established friendship between
Australian and Scottish troops in France
and Palestine alike. In his work upon the
Sinai and Palestine campaign, H. S. Gullett
gives as good an explanation as any. “Not
on ly were both great fighters, but they shared
the same habits of independent thought, the
grasping of essential things in their military
training and bearing, and the frank dislike
for time-honored, purposeless formalities.”
With all respect, one might add to that a
mutual dislike of a certain traditional type
of English officer—a dislike which was as
apparent in the South African War as in
its mighty successor.

“B.O.B.” on craft whose work is done:—
The Pateena and Te Anau, old Union steamers, to
be broken up at Port Chalmers, are the last ot the
type of boats in the M.L. trade that were built for
speed. The Rotomahana, the doyen of them, is
laid up in Melbourne. She could stick it out all
night on the Lyttelton run at 15A knots, although
she had only compound engines. The Te Anau was
built in 1879, and with the Rotomahana ran excur-
sions across the Tasman to the Sydney International
Exhibition in 1880. The Pateena joined the Union
fleet when the Tasmanian S. S. Co. was taken over,
and ran for the most part in the Wellington-Picton-
Nelson trade, where her old-fashioned tailrods, each
with a kewpie lashed to it with ribbons, swung up
and down over many a mile of sea. She had the
same lean lines as the Rotomahana, without the
pretty clipper bow. On one terrific day of southerly
gale at Wellington, the Pateena sailed gaily out for
Pioton, to the amazement of the shore folk, who soon
lost sight of her in the smother seaward. She got
through, but the strain helped to shorten her days.
So did the rapid express work she put in between
Wellington and Onehunga, when the economy rail-
way movement made it a three-days run by rail from
the capital to Auckland. Finally, when the "Pat”
took to running round in circles in the narrow
Cook’s Strait waters, she was sent to Dunedin to rest,
In her better days this packet did the 52 miles

between Wellington and Picton in 3f hours as
regular as a clock; every turn of her propeller sent
her along 17 feet. Like the other two she was
a pretty boat, with a tall funnel set well forward
and a roomy upper-deck aft. The Arawatta and
Wodonga have much the same lines.

Victoria lost its most learned Speaker,
John Emanuel Mackey, by heart failure at
the week-end. He had been a great worker.
Starting life as a compositor, he. toiled
through Melbourne Uni., winning innumer-
able prizes and first-class honors. When
he had got through his Arts and Law courses
the Senate made him Acting-Prof, of Logic
and Philosophy; and for many years after-
wards he was Lecturer in Equity. His wife
-—a daughter of that Win. Bates who was
in McCulloch’s last Ministry—had much
to do with pressing him on towards a politi-
cal career; and it looked at one time as
though the Premiership was coming his way.
But the Chair really suited his own tempera-
ment better, and he had been a conspicu-
ously successful Speaker for seven years
past.
Just about £240,000 was left by T. H. S.
Ilawkes, the Geelong (Vic.) merchant who
was one of the victims of the ’quake in
Japan. Only £750 goes to Geelong institu-
tions, the rest to relations, mainly the widow
mid two sons. If the widow remains un-
married she is to have £3OOO a year for life
and the right to occupy two palatial homes
at Geelong and Ocean Grove; if she marries
(she is just middle-aged and well-preserved)
she is to get £lOOO a year and no free homes.
The State Treasury will lift nearly £25,000
in probate duty.

WILLIAM J.
MAYO, of the
Mayo Clinic at
Rochester
(U.S.A.) —one of
the world’s most
famous surgeons,
now touring
Australia and

gospel of better
hospitals.
The death of Martin Chapman, at 78, re-
moves the doyen of the M.L. legal profession
and one of its first K.C.’s. His father, a
Judge, who named him after his friend, the
first Chief Justice, was a companion of John
Stuart Mill; his brother, the recently
knighted Judge, is an authority on Pacific
history and folk-lore; himself, perhaps the
most remarkable of the three, was an accom-
plished mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
botanist, musician and linguist, who man-
aged to master French. German, Dutch.
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Karori
(M.L.) was his birthplace, although Mel-
bourne Grammar School implanted , the
seeds of a culture that was subsequently
unexcelled by any colonial wig. He took
his examinations at the Inner Temple, and
prior to commencing practice was placed in
charge of two expeditions in financial
research to Iceland and Canada. During his
53 years at the M.L. Bar he edited the
Law Reports aiid was sec. to the Judicial
Commission of 1881, which proved a god-
send to practitioners by codifying the rules
of civil procedure. But his chief pride was
that lie could once out-throw anyone he had
ever met with a cricket ball, and that no one
could show him points in yacht-sailing.
Rev. .T. A. Lee, of the Wallau (Vie.)
kirk, who was a newspaper proprietor before
he took to sky-piloting, is responsible*, for
one of the newest varieties of wheat bear-
ing a clerical title. The breeder —Pye, of
the Dookie Agri-
cultural College—
was just wonder-
ing what he should
christen his newest
infant when Lee,
then in charge of
the Dookie Church,
blew into the col-
lege yard. “That
settles it,” said
Pye—“ ‘The Min-
ister.’ ”
F. W. LUNDIE,
Adelaide sec. of

militant director
of the
election
campaign
which will
probably
send Labor
back to the
Government
benches in
A. Aus.
W. J. George, oue of Jimmy Mitchell’s
lieutenants, is the man whose membership
goes furthest back in Groperland’s Assem-
bly ; he first arrived there in ’95. but the
House knew him not from ’O3 to ’O9, when
he had a steadier job as Commissioner of
Railways. “Mulga” Taylor, Speaker since
T 6, and W. D. Johnson are the only sur-
vivors in the new Assembly of W.A.’s
original Parliamentary Labor party, which
came into being, six strong, just 28 years
ago. Taylor has held his seat continu-
ously, although he parted company with
Labor at the time of the conscription split;
Johnson, still a “true blue,”' returns after
an absence of seven .years, and he was out
for a twelvemonth, or so in his earlier days.
Nevertheless, he was a prominent figure in
the Daglisli Labor Cabinet of ’O4-05 and the
Scaddan ditto of ’l4-16, and if administrative
experience counts lie should come out of the
forthcoming scramble with a portfolio. John-
son actually had a spell of Acting-Premier-
ship as long ago as ‘O4, when very few of
his present Labor colleagues were in Parlia-
ment.
Scores of civil servants and many ex-
prisoners. more or less reformed, are mourn-
ing the death of I)r. J. A. O'Brien, who
until three years ago was Vic. Government
Medical Officer. His prim, precise, old-
fashioned style was a'contrast to that of
the blunt, corne-to-the-point Andrew Shields,
his predecessor and fellow Scot. Entering
as a junior mod. in the Lunacy Branch 45
years ago, O’Brien rose to be superintendent
of the Sunbury Asylum and then got the
premier sawbones job. On a technicality he
was deprived of a pension, the reasons
assigned doing more credit to Ministers’ re-
spect for law than their regard for equity.
“Two Seas”: Away back in ’94, when a
branch of the Farmers and Settlers’ Assoc
was being formed in Bin gar,a. (N.S.W.),
there was strong opposition .among the
organisers against admitting a young
man who was council clerk and general
Pooh Bah of the village. He was a
verv genial young man. and very
popular where a good song and a better yarn
were appreciated; but the hard-shell
cockies objected to him as being an out-
sider whose interests concerning the better
administration of the land laws (which were
dam bad) were not identical with their
own. In course of time that young man,
whose name was Wearne, went farming
himself, and is now Minister for Lands.
<l l^ un ds”; The dramatic resignation of
the Rev. R. B. S, Hammond as campaign
director of the N. S. Wales Alliance will
come as a relief to most of the - reporting
fraternity. At oiie time there were no better
friends than he and the press j ■ even those
who did not concur with his views had a
genuine respect for a man whose Christian-
ity was vigorous, and who for years had run
at his own expense a shelter for deadbeats.
But the cordiality began to be strained with
the growth of Hammond’s obsession that
: Prohibition was just about everything that
mattered. He would prepare long-winded
statements, and when they didn't appear in
full his annoyance was generally vented on
a quite innocent interviewer. His mind was
clouded with a suspicion that newspaper
men and their papers are all mercenaries in
a huge liquor plot, and this killed the last
vestige of his popularity with pressmen.
Probably it has something to do with his
resignation; certainly a big factor in the
success of any campaign is friendliness be-
tween the campaign leader and the reporters.
The future storyteller will have to find
someone else on whom to fasten the
often-told tale of an old-time noisy Sydney
Oommem. a rowdy performance at the
Palace Theatre and a frolicsome red-headed
“girl” in the stalls, the whole resulting in
the Uni. authorities suppressing these Com-
mem. outbursts. Popular Tom Rolin had
the credit of being the “lady” while he was
at the Bar : now that lie is a judge the time
has arrived to say that it wasn’t he—that
he had indeed taken his degree and left the
Uni. years before the incident occurred.
David Syrnon, who died the other day in
London, was well known years ago in West-
ralia, where he established the business of
Symon. Hammond and Hubble, merchants
and shipping agents. When the Cinderella
State attained to representative government
he was one of the first members of the House
Of Assembly. Eventually he retired.to Eng-
land. Josiah Symon, the Adelaide K.C., is
an elder brother.
Passed out at Ashfield (Sydney) the other
day, Leonard Ernest Lowry, who was with
the 4th F.A.8., and after being sent to
Blighty with enteric was attached to
the A.I.P. and War Chest Club in Horse-
ferry-road. As sergeant and subsequontly
warrant-officer he did much for the comfort
and entertainment of the Digger on leave,
and many men now scattered all over Aus-
tralia will regret the new r s of his going w r est.
He was only 34 when cancer called him.
W. L. Payne, chair of the lately-appointed
Q. Prickly Pear Board, has let no grass
grow under his feet singe, he entered the
Lands Department in 1907. He qualified
for the Bar, and as a barrister at the
Supreme Court conducted over 2000 cases in
five years. These included the Clermont Flood
Relief Resumptions case and the redeter-
mination of Pastoral Holdings under the
famous 1920 Land Act Amendment. Payne
has been Under Sec. for Lands since 1922,
and was on the last Royal Commission that
inquired into the domestic affairs of the
prickly pear.
A man with a strange history was “Pro-
fessor” Isedor Hermann, who died the other
day. Born in Poland of Jewish parents, he
studied medicine, and progressed so well that
it is said he was once attached to the Czar’s
household. He certainly was sent on expedi-
tions to Persia and South America in search
of curative herbs. Later he settled in Eng-
land ; then lie went to South Africa, held
a medical appointment under the Boer Gov-
ernment, and was a friend of Kruger. Dur-
ing the lo years lie was in Australia lie
mainly practised as a herbalist. He had
travelled the five continents, and been to the
most out-of-the-way parts of some of them,
and lie undoubtedly had a wonderful grasp
of several sciences; but there was a good
deal of the charlatan in his manner. Inciden-
tally, he was the father of Earle Hermann,

“Fax”: Having a real respect for all
honest bearers of the mail-bag, I wish bad
luck to Frank Bropliy, of Ballarat, again
selected as Labor candidate for Ararat and
Stawell in the Vic. Assembly. Bropliy is a
letter-carrier. At present his liver is active,
his brain clear, and himself a citizen in an
indispensable position. If fie gets into Par-
liament he will enjoy none of these Blessings.

“Astor” weighs a few criminals :—-
Although Angus Murray is to be hanged in Mel-
bourne Gaol next Monday, it can hardly be contended
that his record is as bad as that of some notorious
prisoners who can count on ultimate release. Cer-
tainly his crime chart doesn’t exhibit such a peak
of heinoushess as the cold-blooded murder of a St.
Kilda citizen for which a ruffian named Pearce :s
now serving a grossly inadequate term in Pentridgo.
x °r has Murray been guilty of the savagery of the
red-headed crook (also at the Farm) who did his
best to kill Geoffrey Syme in a celebrated encounter
at Kew some years back. Murray certainly robbed a
bank under arms in 1917, and, though it is popularly
assumed he was carrying a gun m the recent Glen-
it.-rie affair, there is no proof of it. Murray is
admittedly a bad lot, but common sense insists that
the Law 7 , which will scrag him as an accessory to a
homicide, is inviting juries to be more cautious about
their verdiets in future. Rightly or wrongly, there
is a growing body of intelligent opinion against the
infliction of the capital sentence in any but the very
plainest cases of murder. Murray has twice escaped
from gaol, showing more courage, resource and
cunning than the police have revealed in hunting
him down, and one can’t help feeling that this
factor, coupled with the mob passion stirred by
“shock” journalism, has been in some measure respon-
sible for the Lawson Government's refusal to remit
the death penalty.

“Surcingle" : Moses Mondell Phillips, who
has ousted Dr. Mclnerney from the post of
warden of the Melbourne ’Varsity Senate, is.
among other things, Master .in Equity and
Master in Lunacy. There is a yarn in the
Crown Law Department that when he suc-
ceeded another Mac in the Equity job, the
dispossessed persisted in occupying his old
office in the Law Courts. One morning
Phillips, in beautifully pressed pants, top hat
and claw-hammer coat, arrived at the office
first. His predecessor turned up soon after,
and, with the whole law staff as onlookers,
bundled Phillips into the passage and kicked
his belltopper out after him. Then the
police intervened and the superseded officer
left the office for good.

Moresby, who is returning to Spain after 10
years with Black Brother.
“Cleveland” : Left by the Jervis Bay for
London, the veteran Daniel Jones, with his
pockets! full of samples of ratoon cotton to
be .submitted to the spinning authorities in
Britain. His trip is the outcome of the
long-sustained uproar the Queensland cotton
cocky has raised against being compelled
to grow “annual” cotton or nothing. The ex-
penses of the trip are being borne by the
class which has so much at stake; and a lot
of the cash came in in half-crowns. Even
half-crowns have not been plentiful with the
cotton cocky of late.
The S.A. branch of the Geographical
Society has recently unearthed a sword of
historic interest. It Originally belonged to
Major Warbnrton. who did some notable
exploration work in the ’sixties. For reasons
best known to himself, the Major persisted
in wearing the weapon in its leather scab-
bard when interviewing the abos. Ulti-
mately it was lost in the scrub, and although
careful search was made it could not be
found. Forty years later a young abo.,
while pursuing a kangaroo in the mallee
near Fowler's Bay, came across the'missing
cheese-toaster and handed it to his boss. The
latter was the late K. T. Maurice, also an
explorer, who brought tlie re.ie to A h .aide,

seat against veteran Tommy Langdon, and
later the Grampians for the House of Reps.

“Itivcrina”: When I was a very small boy
a good many blacks still navigated the Murray waters,
and some of those canoe marks that “Spenner”
noticed (B. 21/2/’24) were fresh on the big gums.
The prising of the bark from the tree was done at
intervals and was a slow process. After the canoe
had been outlined, the edges were gently lifted for
a few inches all round ; then the work was left for
a spell, to be resumed later when the sap had dried
round the cut. This gradual separating allowed the
canoe to partly dry on the tree and so retain the
desired shape. (Taken off in one operation, a canoe
would be useless, as the bark would curl and split.)
The lowering was done very carefully with loops of
white-feller rope, or, failing that, ropes of rushes or
flexible bark. Then came the final drying —in the
■“hade some calking with clay, and the craft was
ready for business. By the way, “The Gumtree
Canoe” was among the most popular of the old bush
PROOF.
MRS. S KINNER (to new lodger): “This is your fourth cup, Mr.
Jones. You must he very fond of tea.”
MR. JONES: “One would think so, Mrs. Skinner, seeing that I
am willing to drink so much water to get a little of it.”
songs. The air is still widely known, but few seem
to know the words. Can someone in the Council
oblige? Also, as I have heard that the song was
composed by one Isaac Hall, is there any information
available on that point ?
* * * *
“II.W.”: Among the yarns with more
humor than truth in them that are . being told of che
Anglo-Indian officers who are gaining pastoral experi-
ence here in the Western District (Vie.) is that one
of them the other day was explaining the prospects
of his block, which is supposed to carry 1000 sheep,
“You see, old bean,” he said, “a thousand ewes
means a thousand lambs. At a pound a head that
means £lOOO for the bally lambs alone—and oh,
yes, then there is the fur off the mothers.”
* * * *
“Tang-aloli”: Talking of bucking horses,
when a prad gets well down to business, with his
head between his forelegs and his back arched, he
naturally puts a great strain on the crupper. Three
times I have seen the crupper break and cause the
saddle to slip right over the withers and drop ihe
rider, still sitting on the saddle, upon the ground.
In one case the rider was a man named Bob Phelan,
and the incident occurred about 60 years ago on the
Upper Hunter (N.S.W.). In the other two tie
principal actors were my own daughters—one at the
head of the Manning (N.S.W.) and one in Fiji. On
both occasions when the girls landed they were still
sitting on their saddles with the reins in their hands,
the bridles having been pulled off by the saddles in
passing. In none of the three cases was the girth
broken or unbuckled.
* * * #
“Herodot”: Near Lismore (N.S.W.) is
a farmer who owns a valuable cow which, about
three years back, fell down the bank of a creek
and fractured one of her forelegs. An effort was made
to set the broken limb, the animal being suspended
in a sling; but, although the bene showed signs of
knitting, gangrene commenced at the site of the
fracture and spread extensively along the leg. As
the cow had won a number of prizes, her owner was
loath to destroy her; so, on the advice of a
vet., the leg was amputated, chloroform and
ether being used as anaesthetic. Subsequently, when
the stump had healed, Strawberry was fitted with i
wooden leg, into the upper part of which the
stump was strapped. It took some time for the
animal to accustom herself to the appliance, but she
became used to it and is now to be seen stumping
about the farm quite unconcernedly.
* * * *
“Lobjc” : The best shot I ever knew was
my old dad. At 30 yards he could split the bullet
of a .22 on the blade of a knife stuck upright in a
post, and, barring accidents, do it every time. Ex-
perience taught him that if the bullet hit the knife-
blade plumb centre the two halves would fly off
fairly equally, as though following the sides of a
V. From this it was an easy step to make both
halves of the split bullet hit two targets simultane-
ously, and his best effort was to clip both pips in
the two of spades—the card being placed on its
side about Gin. behind the knife-blade. Any unchari-
table Abo.-liar can try this experiment for himself—-
but borrow someone elsc’s knife.

-“l’ick : The aquatic bird about which
“Golwyn” seeks information (B. 20/3/’24) is one of
the most common among waterfowl of the N.S.W.
Southern Tableland. There, as in . “Colwyn's”
district, it is known only as the “diver,” but it is
a diminutive species of the grebe family. “Colwyn”
is wrong in suspecting that the little fellow cannot
fly. Notwithstanding his smallish wings he can fly
with great speed, though, accustomed as he is to
diving for safety, he rarely rises on the wing except
to seek new quarters. He is remarkable for his
extraordinary sudden-appearance act. Lakes that for
months have been dry will have divers in them an
hour or two after a sudden thunderstorm, and no one
knows whence the birds came. They nest on the
lakes, where they build a floating domicile of reeds ;
but the story that they paddle their nests to and
fro is a myth. The wind, though, often wrecks the
little structures by blowing them ashore.
/£■ •&• x-
“ltagar” : Some time ago I took home a
nest of the praying-mantis attached to a spray of
ti-tree. An argument as to the number of eggs laid
in the nest was the cause of
my detaching it from the twig
and putting it into a glass-
covered box. In due course it
hatched out 113 youngsters.
We counted them, on the day
they first came to light, and
then, owing to a serious acci-
dent to one of the members of
the family, the insects were
forgotten for the time being.
Three weeks later I was told
to go and look at the praying-
mantis box, and on doing so
I found only 17 living ones,
and the remains of what ap-
peared to be about a score.
The survivors were large, fat
and well-developed, and, know-
ing their savage and cannibal
habits, I realised what had
taken place. To see what
eventually would happen I left
them as they were, and three
days later their numbers were
reduced to 14. Then I was
called away up country, and
on my return, a month later,
I found only the dead body of
an outsized and fully grown
female. She had evidently
scoffed the last of her brothers and sisters, and
then, finding nothing more to chew, had turned no
toes - I reckon the elderly naval man of the
Nancy Bell didn’t beat that lady.
“Mulla”: While fencing challenges are
flying around let me . remark that there is at present
a stake of £,O being held by Jack Llovd, of tne
Excelsior Hotel, Wallumbilla (Q.), to back Jack
l lohr of the same place, to erect 440 posts in
e ght hours. The posts are to be 6ft. apart, 20in in
the ground, and in a line suitable for a fence.
Mohr is to pick the day and the site. His best
performance to date has been 256 posts erected in
4hi. 30mm. in a fence on the Blythdale (Q ) re-
sumptions, the posts being 12ft. apart and 20in
in the ground (strainers 30in.). Needless to sav it
is all sandy country and shovel sinking.

last census-taking (about 1921) at 170 all told. Years
ago lie owned many camels, which he used on Yalata,
once a very large holding stretching along the coast
tor over 100 miles and reaching back inland say 10
miles. Before he sold the place some of the camels
had gone bush on a wild and rocky limestone penin
sula and could not be rounded up. They have never
been handled and attempts to capture them have ail
failed. A few were galloped to a stand-still only to
die shortly afterwards, so kind-hearted George Murrav
gave them sanctuary on their peninsula. I know,
for l once enjoyed several days of this fine old
gentleman s society and hospitality; a few weeks ago
I passed the camel sanctuary and my inquiries re-
vealed the fact that the camels are still there.

“Kenrie” : Stranger tilings have happened
than “Akran’s” snake inside the egg shell (B.
6/3/’24). A friend of mine while travelling in
hlance in 19X7 saw a shell inside a colonel
• * .. * * *
“Rita J.” : “Old Timer,” when he states
that lecent prize-winning sheep have been as wrinkly
as the old Vermonts (B. 13/3/’24), shows his in-
ability to distinguish wrinkles from folds. To the
breeder of high-class sheep wrinkles are a fatal
objection, but there is a good deal of difference
between a “pleated” skirt and a “wrinkled” one.
Let “Old Timer’ visit any stud-sheep station at the
conclusion of the sheep classing, glance through the
culls and compare them with the flock and selected
ewes or rams. “Plain bodies” is the stud sheep-
breeder’s slogan to-day.
“Sarah”: “Bush Lawyer’s” Jim Chalker,
who took a brace and bit and bored a hole in his
tooth until he broke the abscess (B. 14/2/’24), re-
minds me of a stockman 1 know, who, unable to
stand the agony of toothache, used his pocket knife
as a lever, dug jt under the tooth aad pined the
offender right out. Another time he took a small wo .d< n-
liandled screwdriver and, putting it in the groove
of a double tooth, hit the handle with a mallet.
Having broken a part of the tooth out, he picked
up a small live coal and dropped it into the hole,
and when it became cold he replaced it with another.
It did him no harm and he is as well to-day as
ever lie was. But now when he has a toothache
he lets the dentist do the mauling. In those days
he was too nervous to face a dentist’s chair.
With appropriate blushes:—
“Ham”: Bill Carson’s bundle of Bulletins (B.
13/3/’24) was small compared with mv little lot"
I ve over 1200 copies now —and I’d ’have had hundreds
more only 1 used to send my paper on to my mother
during her lifetime. There were occasions nearly
40 years ago when my tea-and-seone lunch money
went for a Bulletin instead of the food. We ha/e
carted the accumulated copies with us every time
we have moved during the past 25 years; and now
my wife has begun to give them away in bundles
as she reckons we are on the eve of our final move,
and the bulk is too great for enclosure in our coffins.
“Herodot”: Some years ago I was at Buna Bay, in
Papua, and a man living there had between 800 and
1000 Bulletins, going back to about 1895. There
were gaps in the dates, of course, caused by thieves,
insects and fire, but principally thieves. The owner
had started the collection in Townsville (N.Q.) and
had lugged it from there to the Northern Territory
and Dutch New Guinea, finishing up in Papua. Also,
a reader in a N. Queensland town has practically
every issue from 1902 —there are only half a dozen
numbers missing; fr equent efforts to obtain
these in order to make the collection com-
plete hare beerr unsuccessful. Incidentally,
a writer some time ago described his jov
at coming across a bundle of Bulletins in a
small town in Nova Scotia. He thought a lot of
that find. But an Australian medical man who was
in Russia when the Bolsheviks gained the upper hand
tells me that to get out of the country he crossed
Siberia to Vladivostoek, and in a small town about
20 miles from the latter place he found a year-old
Bulletin.
* -X- * *
“Hecagus”: Sometimes it’s Jacky’s turn.
A luckless angler fishing from the rocks in Trinity
Bay (Q.) asked his abo. help if there were any fish
about in the rock holes farther up the bay. “By
crikes,” said Jacky, “I know cne big feller longa
one hole up there, boss. Him bin there now five,
THE REAL DIFFICULTY.
"How did you find your wife token yon got
home last night?”
“Easily. But it took me a long time to
find home.”
s, " x '—close up io year now." “Liar!” exploded the
knight of the rod. “How you bin know it that
same feller fish?” “Oh, I bin know it orright, boss,”
came the grinning reply. “That feller fish got it
one feller tooth out in front.”

THE RAINS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Drought, the demon, with red sword slaughters
The flocks and herds of our far-flung plains,
Oh, sweet is the vision of spreading waters,
And sweet is the song of the falling rains !
At their down-coming all life rejoices,
All life that journeys on foot and hoof;
And no song sung by the first of voices
Is like their music on wall and roof.
They march, march on, do these generous givers
Of grass and herbage, the wide land through ;
They wake the creeks and they rouse the rivers,
Till creek and river run singing, too.
On broad sea-highways to starved lands olden
Their gifts go speeding to save and stead;
To them responding the grain grows golden
And yields for people their daily bread.
Though men scorn much, there are nowhere seornevs
Of earth’s fair blessings of fruit and grain ;
Give thanks, oh ye of the world’s four corners,
For land made fertile by timely rain !
The black duck swims where the green reed quivers.
Wide marshes shelter shy teal and swan,
And heard is the song of the creeks and rivers
That praise the rains as they journey on.

“Pat Bushie”: Tell “Larry Longun” (B.
13/3/’24) that a N. S. Welshman does not have to
leave his own State to find suitable cane for basket-
making. As a nipper I attended the public school
at Lismore (North Coast, N.S.W.) and there we
were taught basket-making with lawyer-cane gathered
by the class from the surrounding scrubs. The cane
was of good quality and varied in size from fine to
three-eights of an inch thick. An old-age pensioner
who lived on our place and worked for Dad as
gardener used to re-seat chairs with this cane, and
the stuff wore as long as the seat on any newly-
pirvhased chair.
MORE BAD LEGISLATION.
HERB: “ Poor Bill was drowned here last year.”
MATE: “ Yairs, Tarlyment shouldn’t let pubs be built on the
oppersite side of cricks.”
“Lobjc” : You needn’t go to Westralia or
the far North to get experience of chasing things
in cars. In the Southern Riverina ’roos are run down
in them every day, and only a few weeks ago 60
hoppers were shot from cars in less than an hour ai
Jack Carse’s place near Urana. In the same district,
too, Otway Falkiner treats all his guests to the
experience—sometimes to their detriment, as when Mrs.
Green had her collar-bone broken when one of bis
big cars overturned some time ago. But for sheer
reckless driving commend me to the y’oung Maharajah
of Bharatpur whom I visited with H.R.H. during
his Indian tour. I!is pet diversion is chasing black
buck in a stripped Rolls-Royce chassis, over, under
or through anything which might be in the way.
Anyone who has seen a buck in action will know
wha„ that means.
“Saaedi”: What is the record journey for
jumbucks in one day ? I don’t mean going by
train or boat or aeroplane, but simply padding the
hoof. One mob of 1200 wethers I know of did 22
miles between sunrise and sunset; but of course I’m
not imagining that that is a record—that’s just to
give ’em a start.
* * * *
“Gouger” : It seems to me that the drone
among the wild bush bees is a grossly libelled person.
He’s said to be a waster ; but I see him working like
a dynamo among the gum blossoms, and making
THE COMFORTER.
CHAUFFEUR (from underneath) : “Don’t worry, boss! We ain’t ’ere for ever. It’s sur-
prisin’ in this climate ’ow the roads dry up.”
regular journeys to the communal home in the
hollow tree, light on the out trip, and always stag-
geringly over-weighted on the return. The civilised
or town drone bee is a waster certainly—and this
makes us bush coves pretty suspicious that there’s a
good few two-legged drones down city-ways too.

“Ortiala” (Papua) : It happened up
West. The white man had occasion to hiake brown
brother toe the line on a rather serious charge. The
R.M., playing the game, put the facts of the case
before the interpreter and told him to tell Brown
Brother just how serious the offence was (it toos
him an hour to do it) and then ask him if he
wanted to say anything. The accused listened in a
bored fashion until the final question, and then lie
answered with great promptitude: “Yes, I did it;
and tell Taubada I would like him make me Govern-
ment policeman.”
“Sarah”: My dad is a timber-getter, but
he cannot work spotted gum. If he just gives a
hand to saw a tree down, his eyes start to inflame
and bung up; and the irritation gradually works
all over his body’. Having never found a cure, he
leaves spotted gum severely alone. Has anyone
had better luck ?
* * * *
“Saaedi”: Ever heard of a squatter being
sacked while shearing his own sheep? I still grin
whenever 1 think of
one such incident which
I witnessed. 8., who
had no shed of his own,
shifted his sheep over
to P.’s place to have
them shorn by contract,
and one day decided to
have a cut himself in
a spare stand. He was
a fair shearer on good
sheep, and his first
catch being bare about
the points and easy
cutting, he turned it
out pretty well. But
his second catch was a
real snag, and soon
blood and profanity
were flowing freely. P.,
a hard-bitten sheepman
of the old school,
watched the awful exhi-
bition quietly until the
■sorrv-looking jumbuck
was thrust down the
shoot; then he spoke
suddenly and emphati-
cally: “You’d better
knock off—you’re a bit
rough.” “But they’re
my own sheep,” B.
protested. “Neve r
mind,” the other re-
torted. “It’s my shed
—knock off ! ” And
knock off he did.
* * *
“Truthful James”: Amazing thing, this
instinct, isn t it ? The other day I killed an adder
and placed it near a two-days-old kitten. The kitten,
although it did not have its eyes open, immediately’
arched its back and spat. The kitten’s mother shot
upwards, volplaned to earth and raced for the hori-
zon. The incident awakened the spirit of scientific
investigation within me, so I put the adder close
to a chicken that had just been hatched. The
chicken dropped dead. I then put an egg which was
nearly hatched near the adder. The egg immediately
rolled three feet away. 1 again picked up the egg
and once more put it close to the adder. This time
it rolled exactly 20 inches, wobbled feebly and
stopped. I broke the shell and found the chicken
taking its last breath.
“FY7”: Tell “Nitric” (B. 20/3/’24) that
the trick of training a horse to walk up to you
in the yard by’ flicking him behind the knee with a
whip is not, as he seems to think, a blackboy’s idea.
I have seen it done by whites ever since I was a
toddler and have often practised it myself. The
whip should be kept on the ground and only the
last few inches “wristed” up for the flick, the arm
remaining by the side. A brother of mine could do
it so w’ell that a close observer could see no motion
save in the wrist and whip. After a bit, with a
well-handled * youngster, the dropping of the lash
in the dust is enough. As far as my experience goes
horses taught this trick are easily enough caught in
the usual fashion. One I know had a disconcerting
habit of suddenly throwing up his knee when you
went up to him ; but he never attempted to strike.
“Nitric” : Re the removal of a dead snake
by a wriggler of the same tribe, mentioned by “The
Rumpus” (B. 20/3/’24). He can bet a turkey to a
tomtit that the undertaker was the mate of the
departed one. I have seen the thing done two or
three times. 1 lit on the explanation after find-
ing next to a snake I’d killed the night before , a
freshly-shed skin. By carefully tracing the tracks
I came to an old stump. Half inside was the life-
less crawler, and a fire soon brought the other to
view. Why she had moulted on the scene of
slaughter beats me, unless it was for the assumption
of widow’s weeds.
* * * *
“Uramao” : “Will dog defend dog against
man?” was a question raised in M.L. recently. A
sheep farmer in the Wairarapa was chastising one
of his tykes, when another dog, resenting the punish-
ment meted out, savagely attacked the farmer. This
was referred to as something unusual; but several
instances in Maoriiand of dog defending clog are
warnings not to rely too implicitly on man’s friend
in such circumstances. Some years ago, at Green-
field, a rabbiter was beating one of a pack of dogs,
when the whole mob attacked him and tore him to
pieces.
* * ♦ *
“Hope On”: Tell “Forason” (B. 2S/2/’24)
that his maize crop was very good on the average,
but his highest stalks (15ift.) were easily beaten
by some grown near Yarram (Vic.), and exhibited
at the local show a few years ago. They measured
17ft. 4in. The problem of conveying them some
miles to the show was solved by two horsemen
carrying them tandem fashion. By the way, I have
seen three potatoes weighing 111 b., also potato stalks
measuring Bft., grown in the same locality. How
are these for records?
“Hecagus”: If “Pick” hunted a crust up
this way (N.Q.) he would be quickly disillusioned
anent the near extinction of platypus (B. 6/3/’24).
The headwaters of the Barron, Mulgrave and Joim-
stone rivers literally teem with these daintily-clad
amphibians. During three years spent on and about
the feeders of the rivers mentioned, I have seen
thousands. In time they become accustomed to
human?, and it is a common thing to see six or
seven sporting in waterholes close ,to my calico
villa. To his shame be it recorded that one man on
the Atherton tableland is alleged to have shot 100
in three months.
“Parama’s” society item :
The New Guinea flapper is just as fond of herself
as her Pitt-stroet sister, and just as keen cn doing
herself up. She does not call it rouge, but she
colors her lips and cheeks with the juice of a berrv
she gathers in the bush; and she goes one better
than Miss Sydney, for she spreads the coloring to
* arn ? s an d legs. Her hair, while innocent
ot the Marcel wave and its fascinations, is dressed
in many ways that are quite as effective and attrac-
tive —to those who see it. In the matter of per-
fume she is also very much all there, with the advan-
tage over her white sister that she uses nothing but
the scent of fresh flowers and leaves crushed between
her hands and rubbed into her hair and skin. She
knows nothing of the cunningly placed beauty-spot
so beloved by some of our more daring society
beauties, but she has them all beaten to a frazzle
by the wav she transfers the actual coloring and
design of the wings of brilliantly colored butter-
flies to the skin of her cheeks, shoulders of breasts.
She prepares the skin first by softly rubbing in the
sap of a shrub, after which the colors stick and
remain fast for several hours. The: merry widow
of New Guinea adopts that dodge whqn making her-
self attractive with the idea of capturing Number
Two. She has several other ideas of her own on the
subject of making the men sit up and take notice.
One little trick she indulges in is to string the late
lamented’s finger-bones into a necklace, paint the
“beads” a bright red and wear them spread across
her bosom. It is a common thing to see glow-worms
and fireflies shining in the hair of the gills at night
as they dance, a form of decoration every bit as
attractive as the be-diamonded heads of our own
jazzing sisters. Her dress? Well, it is skimpy. Too
much so even for Sydney’s swiftest. Her skirts arc
still above the knee —but that's perhaps because she
lias nothing to be ashamed of in the shape of her
legs.
“R.G.”: Re “Henry Bateson’s” inquiry as
to the size of old-men kangaroos. Two friends and
I got one on the plain near Pretty Pine (Denili-
quin, N.S.W.), in 1878 which measured lift. 2in.
from nape of neck to tip of tail. He certainly was
a monster and full of fight. When bailed up he
grabbed at the head of the horse which one of mv
pals was riding, then caught the man himself
around the waist, and when I came on the scene
he chased me round some boree bushes until our
third pal and his dog arrived and helped us tc
settle matters.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: I see they still cling to the
idea in the Cold Country that no diver can descend
to more than 30 fathoms. The statement has once
more been made as a climax in a discussion running
recently in one of the London illustrated papers con-
cerning Kitchener and the j)Ossibility of sending
down a diver to find out what really happened to
the Hampshire. The cruiser is probably too deep,
in any case; but the gentlemen who protest that a
man “can’t possibly live” below 30 fathoms had better
take a stroll Torres Straits way and see the dress
divers doing their 40 or so. With the respirator
they’ve been down to well approaching 50. 1 don't
say that it’s healthy ; but it’s done.
* * * *
“Pommy”: A Fijian laborer at Ivanacia
was killed by a fish the other day’. Joni was out
with a spear on the reef. lie put up an oqo
(pronounced “onga”—Fijian equivalent for barra-
couta), had a dash at it and missed. A few minutes
afterwards he was spearing another fish, when the
oqo attacked from the rear, bit Joni’s foot almost
off at the ankle and took a chunk out of his calf.
The lad’s comrades got him ashore, but he bled to
death. An examination showed that the fish had
bitten through the bone as cleanly as a crocodile
could have done it. Fishy men say that Joni must
have got between the barracouta and his prey—
both no doubt were after the same fish!
* * * *
“Pick” : When railway fettlers are travel-
ling on their tricycles the thing most dreaded, next
to the flying light engine of which they have not
been warned, is the sleepy jew -lizard. Jewy finds
the ballasted permanent-way a convenient place for
his home, and in the early morning’s sun, just when
the fettler is hurriedly running his length, intent
on watching ahead for defects in the way, the
sprawling monstrosity basks across the warming
rails. He is too indolent to move when the trike
approaches him, and if he is struck amidships at
a fast pace on a down-grade it generally means a
run-off and possibly a crash over an embankment.
On the Brook’s Hill cutting (Cooma line, N.S.W.),
the language of the fettlers and pumpmen occa-
sioned by jew-lizard spills has withered the gum-
trees.
BBEING IS NOT ALWAYS BELIEVING.
MR. SOZZLE ( inspecting snake): “Cmph!
Bring it to me (hie) to-morrer morn in';
and if it’s a (hie) real one (hie) I’ll
give you a bob!”
“Daddy” : Re cats getting wet. I live on
a deepwater tidal stream 80yds. wide. A neighbor
received a visit from an old tabby and four tabby-
ettes about one-third grown, and, not being a
lover of cat, he borrowed my boat and put them
over the river on Christmas Eve. Next morning
the old lady paid me a visit in a disgraceful state,
dripping with water. I looked over the river for
the youngsters, and spied them all swimming the
stream. My finer feelings rebelled, and I rescued
them, put the whole caboose in a bag, and returned
them to my neighbor with Santa Claus’s compliments.
Yes, cats can swim all right.
HIS BOYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill was the first to break away;
He was one of the restless kind.
Since he could walk he would dream and talk
Of the fortunes he meant to find.
Twas opal that took him to Lightning Ridge,
Gold lured him to Southern Cross;
Ile'd work or fight for a white man’s right,
But he’d never take to a boss.
Danny was always a sturdy lad,
And lie made his start with a plough;
lie was one to save and toil and slave
And he’s reaping the harvest now.
His years were lean ere the fat ones came—
He’d a home- to keep, and a wife —
Hard was the row that he had to hoe;
For the land is a strong man’s life.
Arthur was dressy and fond of sport;
He hadn’t a pound or a care.
He liked the city with light and life;
And he wrote to us last from there.
Some people say he’s a ne’er-do-well,
That he’ll never c ome home again;
I know they’re wrong, their tongues are too long—
They don't know a parent’s pain.
Angus made good with a. bushinan’s store
On the coast, where the rich lands are.
His stock vas small, but lie sold it all;
He’s the owner now of a car.
I always thought he would make his pile,
For his wits were keen as a lad;
He’d trade in toys with our neighbor’s boys—
And Angus was never “had.”
One of them died when they all were young—
The smartest one of the lot.
Time brought relief with a softened grief,
But his mother never forgot.
It seems to me only the other day
I patched their boots and their toys ;
’Twas a struggle then, but they worked like men
And at school they were all good boys.
I’m seventy-eight, but my back is straight
And I take a drink and a smoke;
I can eat my fill, 1 am never ill
And I see the point of a joke.
Their mother—wise counsellor, wife and mate
For fifty years that have f10wn....
She went. .. .we parted... .just for a while. ...
I am waiting n0w.... and alone !
N.S.W.

The ESSEX-SIX
Built by Hudson under Hudson Patents
Smoothness in operation, unusual
flexibility, and splendid road perform-
ance, are qualities which have caused
the leading British Motoring Journals
to pass flattering comments on the
ESSEX-SIX.
“The Motor,” February 5, 1924, says:—
‘‘The engine is vibrationless and will
take the car along at 2\ m.p.h. without
a tremor. . . .From this speed a ready
pick-up can be obtained without chang-
ing down.... Thirty miles per hour
seems but ten or twelve, so smooth is the
engine. . . .The acceleration on second is
terrific and it is one of the most lively
cars in which we have ridden.”
Such praise from the British Press is one of the
greatest compliments the car could possibly
have received.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
BY
GALLET
Perfumes
Soaps
Powders
Through the rain and the withering blast
of Saturday battalions of Boy Scouts and
small-brother cubs surged to the Inner Domain
to pay tlieir respects to Chief Scout Dudley
de Chair, who, looking overhead and under-
foot, must have been pleased that one engage-
ment at any rate was only a step away from
his front door. There was the inspiriting
rattle of the kettle-drum, the more militant
note of the trumpet, a flashing of banner-
ettes and hardy kneecaps, and then Scout
Commissioner Raymond Moore invested the
Viking with the grand order of the Big Chief.
While her Admiral was pledging himself
to the admirable Scout law of at least one
good deed a day, Lady de Chair was mur-
muring the'Official sesame at the War Mem-
orial Hospital fete at Waverley in smart
frocking of navy worked over with brown
thread, till the whole resembled the letter
from Pharaoh’s daughter to Moses on the
danger of getting the feet wet. (The epistle
is still in excellent preservation at the Brit-
ish Museum, and can be viewed by Austra-
lians visiting the Empire Exhibition on pre-
senting a special letter of introduction.)
With this the new vice-reine’s happy smile
was worn under a close-fitting brown hat
finished off centre-front with a joyous posy
of pink roses. Commander Craufurd’s lady
was her companion, and wrapped her length
in brown swathings. Junior Red Crossers
and Girl Guides formed a guard of honor,
and at the end of the girlish lane Padre Hill
was waiting with an address of welcome,
and tiny Betty Winn kept tryst Avith an
armful of feathery-petalled chrysanthemums.
Chief Secretary Oakes led the A?ote of thanks,
and Jamies, M.L.A., unveiled the tivo
machine-guns that the Australian War
Museum has handed o\ : er to the hospital—
presumably for the cure of post-war nerves.
The organisers of the Hospital Saturday
1- im <3 arranged a programme of pleasant
sounds to accompany their big meeting last
Friday. Lady De Chair was in command,
and cheered up the stage Avith rich blue
frocking and black millinery stabbed by an
efficient-looking black quill. Secretary A. L.
Blythe outlined the work - of the fund, and
urged the collectors in the audience to make
the song of their boxes loud in the land.
Her Ex., who had travelled over 300 miles
to keep her date with the meeting, mur-
mured appreciation of the plans suggested.
Hospital Saturday will really be a Friday
this year—May 2.
Dr. Lucy Gullett got a big hand the other
day Avhen she concluded the yearly report
of the new hospital for women ’and children.
The meeting was held at the Women’s Club,
and, notwithstanding that the institution is
entirely staffed and run by our fair sex, a few
of the unfair ivere allowed through the club’s
almost man-proof fortifications. The year’s
Aimrk has been very successful: nearly 8000
attendances have been recorded, and, although
the hospital is only for out-patients, there
are noiv three doctors in attendance every
day. The committee hopes before this year
is out to see the foundations laid of an indoor
hospital for sick women and children.
. of the 'gayest frolics of the week was
given in the interests of the babies of St.
Margarets. It was named a Fools’ Cap
dance, because it was dated for the first of
the month, and every diner cheerfully bought
a cap,' tall or short, square-rigged or curved,
and pinned it to her locks, or gummed it to
the vacant areas on his crown. May Shelian,
the hospital’s assistant secretary, in her
period frock of pink velvet and silver lace,
might have stepped straight out of “Mile-
stones.” Her put-back-the-clock dressing was
intensified by hairdressing of the same hour
Sister Kerven, in China blue tulle and black
A'elvet, hostessed a large dinner party; so
did Mrs. Donald Bourke and hospital secre-
tary George Fitzpatrick’s wife. Dr. Lang-
ton’s wife, avlio was president of the money-
raiser. supported black panne with dignity-
and Clifford Hay, of the Premier’s Depart-
ment, brought his lady in graceful black and
silver drapings.
The Paper and Poster Ball, at the Went-
worth, on Monday night, bagged the new
State Exes. It was the first of the new
season s jazz flutters in aid of the Crown-
street Women’s Hospital; and, as usual, the
loyalists of that institution rallied nobly.
The affair was a dinner-dance, and the vice-
royals picked their chicken-bones at a table
where they could see and be seen by all
Pale pink carnations turned the table into a
flower farm; and the nice De Chairs had for
company the Waley knight and his lady—
she very handsome in black lace and magni-
ficent opals, the Justice Sly couple, the
medical Ludowicis, Commander Grant and
his petal-cheeked wife, hospital secretary
Mona Daley in the luxury of white brocade
and monkey-fur, and that handsome knight
of the air, Commander Coote.
Midway through last week there was an
overflow congregation at St. Mark's, Darling
Point, to purr approval over the riveting
of the lives of Mkiflie (Mary Constance)
Payton, only daughter of the Deputy-Town
Clerk, and Edgar Rouse. Probably Eve
never walked a more flowery path to keep
a date with Adam than that which the
tall bride traversed, supported by father’s
arm, to give her hand to her best young man.
Down an aisle that had been turned into a
lane of pink blossoms the ivory satin and
Limerick lace whispered. Sam Hordern’s
two girleens followed in pink chantilly lace,
through which glowed the rosy hue of satin,
their faces eclipsed by scuttle-shaped pink
millinery. Canon Lea and silver-toned
choristers saw to the rest, with the assist-
ance of the bridegroom, who was best-
manned by Gilbert Norris, with Muffle’s only
brother Will as offsider.
After the ceremony a long, long string
of cars dashed back to the Wentworth for
the wedding dinner, a splendid affair, start-
ing with cocktails and ending with cham-
pagne. The new Mrs. Rouse, looking like
the spirit of a slim Chinese white glaze
vase, took her congratulations in the Palm
Court, banked by her husband, her new in-
laws and her parents, her impressive father’s
tailorings—which suggested Sackville-street
at its best—being a rival to the backwash
of Brussels lace that frothed from the open-
ing of the low-cut frock and cascaded into
a long train. There were over 300 guests,
every one of them on the Government House
visiting-list; and the Palm Court was an
exotic blooming of furs and satins and bro-
cades, of diamonds and ospreys. Bride’s mother
wore her black lace and satin with an air,
and cheered them up with a bunch of deep-
red roses. The Rouse clan (they’re the
Kodak people) were there in battalions, the
’groom’s mother very sleek in black panne.
William McMillan and his lady gave
daughter Bobbie over to the keeping of actor
Prank Harvey last Thursday. The Method-
ist Church at Bondi Junctioir staged the cere-
mony, and Bobbie murmured the evergreen
assents from the immemorial bridal trappings
of white satin and tulle. Anne Jamieson
’maided in white georgette weighted with
silver embroideries, and a hat of silver lace.
Jim Dickson best-manned. About 80 guests
were entertained by. bride’s father and
mother, she more suggestive of a frontispiece
lor Pride and Prejudice” than ever. The
party was held in the ballroom of the Arthur
Allens’ home, Merioola, because the marquee
at the bride’s own home intended to shelter
the toasts had been blown down by the
morning’s storm.
Emelie Polini had been expected to come
along, but her own matrimonial experiment
has been so much of a failure (she married
a man out of khaki, one Ellis) that at the
moment she was busy in the courts trying
to wrest the cheild from its other parent.
The farm to which the couple retired in the
beautiful country just beyond Rydal has
passed into other hands. So at her leading-
man’s wedding —Us second, too —the pro-
fession was represented by the George Flem-
ming couple.
Make your bob to the new lady of Govern-
ment House, probably the most versatile, and
likely to be the most popular, vice-reine
N. S. Wales has met for a long time. A
mistress of
most outdoor
sports, she is
also a keen
gardener and
an a c c o m
plished needle-
woman. But
he r speech-
making threat-
ens to be her
long suit. She
has ideas and
expresses them
vividly and in
clear tones,
and is not
afraid to be
h u morons.
Society wi 1J
see more of
her during the
Fleet visjf'
than it has
since her arri-
val, for from the day of. landing she has
been working overtime at official duties.
She is a born hostess, and only the fact of
the Fleet being here in Holy Week pre-
vented her giving a monster ball at Gov-
ernment House in honor of the visitors.
Monte Luke made this picture of the lady’s
profile.
There was a linking-up of physical and
spiritual healers on Saturday at Pymble,
when Dr. Olive O’Reilly was married to
padre A. H. Wood, of Hurlstone Park.
Three bridesmaids, Mona Wood and Molly
and Gwen O’Reilly, followed the bride’s ivory
splendor up the aisle of the local Methodist
church, and the cake-dispensation was blessed
by bride’s mother in the family nest.
Little Dr. Arthur’s only son. Bruce, has
become engaged to the nicest girl in Wagga.
She s Kathleen (Kay) Holland, younger
daughter of the W. ,T. Hollands, now of
Wagga, but until lately of Colac (Vic.).
Kay is a keen motorist, and was the cham-
pion horsewoman at last Wagga Show.
Bruce is a returned warrior and a pal of
William Lyndon, of Brisbane, who married
Kay’s sister.
Gladys Owen, who plucked an 0.8. E. for
her Red Cross work, and in the war-fevered
long-ago made some of the best recruiting
speeches heard in Martin-place, has been
claimed again by her old love—Art. Her
recent travels
in England
and on the
troubled Con-
tinent might
he spoken of
as just one
picture-gallery
after another.
Of course, the

of the old

Gladys was
most interested
in the mod-
erns. And on
these she has
spoken with
all her clear-
cut charm to
sister-painters
of the Society of Women Artists. Gladys
is a daughter of Justice Owen ; and he was
a great war-worker, too. May Moore’s
camera caught this glimpse of the clever
girl.
News has come to Sydney that Coleeu
Hixson, whose father was Harley Hixson,
has become engaged to Hugh Seymour Eaton,
whose mother is a daughter of knight Hugh
Dixson.
Lena Gooch, of a Stratlifield family of
songbirds, lias begun to take an interest in
Granny Smiths and other apple aristocrats.
Arthur J. Brown is responsible: the Browns’
orchard at Meadow Lea, this side of
Bathurst, runs to about 15,000 trees. Be-
sides, Arthur J. is connected with many
mines, and will win a seat in Parliament
one of these days—he was runner-up at his
last attempt. The wedding is fixed for
August.
Sam Hordern, who sailed with his lady
and Audrey and Doreen by the Orsova for
a long stay in Europe—it may run to two
years—was given a farewell by the staff of
Anthony Horderns’ during the week. The
Town Hall was packed with well-wishers,
and general-manager Justly Rawlings, in the
interval, handed over an address signed by
more than 3000 employees. The young
chief’s popularity in the big service is very
solid. Somebody said that he was the most
human person in the establishment.
There may not be any truth in the rumor
that' Mona Daley had to charter a special
cargo steamer to carry her farewell gifts to
England, but a battlecruiser could certainly
have been floated in the tea brewed in the
popular hospital secretary’s honor. And
each tea-party carried with it at least one
present. Trunks, rugs, handbags, cushions
and enough hand-worked undies to make a
bride envious! Last week Mrs. George Sar-
gent handed over a fitted travelling-case
against a background of flowers and compli-
mentary speeches; and on Friday the
mayoral lady‘issued invitations for a semi-
civic farewell in her rooms at the Town Hall.
The floral decorations would have' done a
princess proud: masses of red and yellow'
cannas flaunted their cheerfulness against
the murk of the afternoon ; at each end of
the room tall palms towered, and in between
were Michaelmas daisies.
Belgian Consul Segaert has been promoted
to Acting-Gpffsul-General of Belgium, with
charge in Australia. Maoriland and British
and French possessions' of the Pacific Ocean.
The Sydney staff will be strengthened by the
transfer of Mr. A. Nihotte, formerly Vice-
Consul at Melbourne. His wife was an
Oxen ham, daughter of Justinian, formerly
secretary to the P.M.G.
The benefit dance for St. Vincent’s, which
is always an Easter Week attraction, is to be
an Autumn Ball this year, and reds and
browns and yellows of the gipsy season are
to be massed in the decorations* The Town
Hall, as usual, will harbor the revel.
Monty Somer lias something more than
prize turnips and blue-ribbon beasties to be
proud of. This year the Easter Show has
attracted a group of Maoriland lasses for the
riding contests. But they’ll have their work
cut out to win against Miss Australia, who
is coming from every State to enter the lists.
There’s a swagger new Industrial Hall, and
a £90,000 grandstand, in addition to Anthony
Horderns’ new pavilion—the last word in
moneyed architecture. Monty Somer says
with confidence that it is going to be the
greatest show the society lias ever had ; and
lie ought to know.
A Hobart girl sends some introductions:
Captain Fairbairn, of the Dragon, is one of the
most popular men. He is related to the Victorian
Fairbairns, and is the lucky possessor of a pretty
wife, whose photograph decorates his cabin. There
are some fine water-colors there, too, painted by the
same lady.
H. F. Batterbee is the “political secretary” of the
expedition. He is on the Hood, of course. Used 10
be private secretary to Walter Long when he was
in charge of “the Colonies.”
Commander Horsey, secretary to the Admiral, is a
breezy young chap. He and Batterbee go about
much together. He keeps Batterbee strictly to diet
and so forth. Admiral Brand, poor chap, is still
receiving letters from his wife, who died just before
the squadron reached Adelaide. Lieut. Spears (Hood)
is a good-looking youth who would run high in a
“most popular junior” competition. Rugby and
dancing are his long suits. Lieut. Wells is one of
the best dancers (son of Sir Frederick Wells,
famous architect of London). A non-dancer
Lieut. Robinson, who does the “pushing about” of
the famous motor launch, which skims the water
like a seaplane. Captain Rundell, the senior engineer
man, is anxious to see the country when he readies
Sydney. His address is the Repulse. Admiral Field
has a brother with him on the Hood —a charming
man. Hon. Captain Alexander Ramsay (Princess
Pat’s husband) and Captain Fairbairn are alike
enough to be brothers. Ramsay didn’t turn up at
the Military Ball here. Lumbago kept him at home.
He is to make his “second blooming” in Sydney.
Many who are now grandmas will experi-
ence a spasm of sentimentalism at the news
that the old Manly was sold, presumably for
breaking-up purposes, last week. Thousands
of Sydneyites owe their appearance before
the Registrar of Marriages and Births (not
to mention the officials who respectively con-
trol bankruptcy and divorce) to the Manly’s
romantic atmosphere, most of the old ferry-
steamer’s active existence having been passed
in the pre-motor, pre-jazz period, when a
trip “down the Harbor” was one of the few
diversions a man was able to offer a maid.
The Lyric Winter Garden, the new movie
theatre near the Central Station, had an offi-
cial opening on Friday night, after a tea-
party in the afternoon. At tlie top of the
staircase there’s a lounge luxurious with
carpets and tapestries and a playing geyser,
while golden signs point to a soda-fountain
and a lunch buffet round the corner. There
are lounges for men, rest-rooms (decorated
in the most becoming tones of pink and
black) for women, and a nursery and a
trained nurse to look after baby while mother
thrills to the shadowed charm of Rudolph.
The theatre itself is a pastel in pale gold
and green, while the seats are upholstered in
cloth of gold. But with utter indifference
to the comfort and pleasure of clients, the
management has neglected to put in a
Turkish bath and a racecourse.
The Red Cross Handicrafts’ Depot moved
last week. Its new address is Commerce
Buildings, Ash-street, behind the Equitable
Building. All the goods offered here are the
work of invalid soldiers, and they badly
want the money. Call in and see what
they’ve got.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Mary Macgregor, barrister Peter’s clever daugh-
ter, is playing juvenile lead in “Iris” with the
hefty Oscar, and leading lady in “The Skin Game,'
at Adelaide. Then she joins J. D. O’Hara’s eo.
when it comes in from Dryland.
Old St. Paul’s Kirk saw the tying of the knot
betwixt Marjorie Byram and J. S. Lipscombe. Padre
Scott Macdonald adjusted it amid much greenery
and blossom. The bride was in silk tulle with
opalescent ’broideries, and she carried a bouquet
of orchids and stephanotis. 1 Keysor Barnes and
Elma White ’maided in eloth-of-gold. The Cecil
Palmers, Glynn Connollys, Millars, Whites, Lips-
eombes and Morrells and Mollie Brenan were among
the well-wishers. The honeymoon is to shine over
Colombo.
For Jean Piers Blundell the Bills maidens gave
a linen tea at Lutwyche, and guests to the tune of
30 turned up to it.
Nell Swayne’s marriage to Tlieo Wood was the
reason for a farewell to the bride-elect at Farina,
where, amid red gerberas, music was made by Mrs.
Cyril Wood and others. Those who applauded in-
cluded the Pixleys, Althows, Longwills and Swaynes.
In a maroon and blue setting, the Uni. Sports
Union danced in the men’s common-room for the
benefit of the football club. Ethel Campbell and
Enid Howes were among the jazzers.
The E. J. Gillingwaters, who are off on a world
jaunt, had a pair of field-glasses and gold-mounted
fountain-pen handed them at a farewell dinner in
the Rotary-room at Allan and Stark’s.
The end of March saw the passing out of Marian
Baines, who was a well-known philanthropic worker
in Brisbane.
Dorothy Hogarth’s marriage to Duncan MacDonald
united two old Queensland families. She is one of
the Balgownie Hogarths, and lost two brothers at
the war. A blue hat and white voile decked the
bride for the altar. The guest list was confined to
old friends and relations.

Chatter
The Occidental
Collins St. Melbourne
A social slump has followed the delirious
thrills of Fleet Week; but some of the best
gilded, who appear to have mastered the
secret of perpetual motion, will dodge the
awful quiet by plunging into the Corowa
race season, and thereafter continuing the
jazz in Sydney.
Still, no one who can scrape up the price
of an opera ticket can grumble. Grand
opera is booming. The atmosphere of our
trains and tramS is daily warmed by
heated discussions concerning the rival
merits of Melba and Dal Monte nights;
also talk of Tosca is tinged with extracts
of criticism from the press. And, inci-
dentally, Melbourne’s musical education is
being advanced by leaps and bounds. Both
vice-regal houses —but chiefly the G.-G. party
—are represented in the dress-circle reserve,
night after night, though once they didn’t
supply enough distinguished patronage to
fill all the space reserved for them. The Nor-
ton Grimwade pair have been boxed at every
performance. At the first Dal Monte ap-
pearance Melba provided an intriguing
study, as she leant out from her box, lost to
the world in her total absorption of the
Italian star’s Lucia. Probably her mind
travelled back to the days of her own earlier
triumphs as the ill-fated heroine. The Gal-
lery sat to attention when between the acts
various Italian stars advanced into the
Queen of Song’s presence, and ceremoniously
bent to kiss her lily hand. Queensland’s
Governor Nathan sat with the Forsters at
the first “Rigoletto” performance, when
Admiral Hall Thompson’s wife was also
with the vice-regal group. Mrs. Pitt Rivers
made a great round of visits to the various
boxes during the several intervals.
Melba, by the way, is really more than
a conspicuous individual in the audience at
these shows. She is the Italian company’s
guardian angel. On Friday night the make-
up of Augusta Concato was rather appal-
lingly unwinsome. Too much red on the
cheeks and even a suspicion of carmine on
the nose to match the rest of Butterfly’s
bridal blush. What did the watchful Dame
do? Sit still and feel sorry? Hardly! She
rushed behind the scenes after curtain-fall
and explained the case to the signora (who
is said to be tenor I’iccaluga’s sposa) by
rubbing the misplaced paint off her face.
In the next act the new songstress had chast-
ened cheeks and powder on her nose, thus
tending to justify the report that she is a
nice-looking prima donna off the stage.
Thus far Melba and the handsome Tosca
lady are about the only principals of the
vast vocal combine who seem to know what
to put, and what not to put, on the faces
they present to the foe.
Ex-Gov.-General Earl Dudley is handing
his Countess’s coronet to Gertie Millar, the
musical-comedy star and beauty of yesterday.
She is the newly-made widow of the late com-
poser Lionel Monckton. (The pair had been
separated by temperamental differences ■ for
some time.) Dudley is indirectly mixed up
with Australia by more than his short term
of Governor-Generalship. A Moncreiffe
cousin—Dudley’s mother was a Moncreiffe—
who married and died in Melbourne left a
daughter, the late Mrs. Gibson. Then the
eldest Dudley girl, Lady Honor Ward, mar-
ried a Maorilander, Col. Bridgeman, cousin
of John Gurner, K.C., of Toorak. Besides,
there is the old story of “Lady” Munro, the
amusingly unsober lady known to Melbourne’s
police courts of old, who claimed to be a
sister of Lord Dudley’s mother, and certainly
looked very like the other Moncreiffe
daughters. One of the girls did marry a
Colonel Munro, and the drunken lady’s
assumption of a title seemed natural in the
circs.
Leslie Bodycomb took possession of Sylvia
Sutton from her medical father the other
night at Melbourne Grammar chapel. Padre
Arnold spoke the words that made them
one, and Dr. David Bodycomb was there
to see his brother through the operation.
The bride murmured her vows in silver bro-
cade with a backwash of satin weighted
with orange flowers. More blossoms an-
chored the bridal veiling,, and silver ribbons
fluttered from her snowy nosegay. Sister
Meredith ’maided in apricot silk, clamped on
the port side with a trail of water-lilies,
and plumes of the same fruity coloring
friuged her filmy brown picture-hat. A
handful of relations joined in the health-
drinking that followed. The newly-weds are
’mooning in Sydney before returning to
unpack their wedding presents at Toorak.
Mrs. Harold Clapp gave the English-
speaking union another lift the other after-
noon with a gathering of the swishest petti-
coats in her South Yarra parlors. Mrs. De
Castro —the American matron with a ravish-
ingly sweet voice which suggests Dublin
rather than Yaukeeland—and the Girls’
Grammar head, Miss Gilman Jones, came
in to explain the inner meaning of this
form of unionism; but both rather side-
tracked the wliys and wherefores, the former
to urge her hearers to extend the hand of
friendship to Germany, the latter to ask
for a wider hospitality for ’Murkan visitors.
Mrs. Clapp, whose intelligence is as bright
as her dark eyes, and who knows her
America well after several years under the
Stars and Stripes, cheerfully intimated that
the union of the English-tongued might
eventually stand for the peace of the world.
The teacups rattled comfortingly before and
after the talks, and Violet Jackson and
Mrs. Alf Taylor punctuated the proceedings
with sweet music. Mrs. Clapp, who had
a sister, Miss Noel, to help look after the
guests, fluttered a black crepe skirt with
an upper section of black and golden em-
broideries. New American Consul Blake’s
feminine half, a youthful Spanish beauty,
was there with the equally-ncw Vice-Consul’s
pretty little fair-haired American wife. The
spouse of the French Consul, Mrs. Turck,
must have listened to. the proceedings with
mixed feelings. The Arthur Robinson and
Littleton Groom dames smiled on the event:
so did Mrs. Clive Gaunt, sister-in-law of
Admiral Guy Gaunt and sister of the late
“Chinese” Morrison. The Dc Jersey Grut
daughter, Mrs. Purchas, who is now an
American resident, was receiving congratu-
lations for brother Leslie and his trans-
Atlantic wife, who are now the proud parents
of an Australian-born son ; and among a
host of others present was Mrs. Richard
Linton, just back from an English trip with
her husband.
At the Alliance Frangaise’s opening
swarry in the Vic. Artists’ Galleries,: Swiss
Consul Cornioley livened up the evening
with a travel-talk about his native land,
richly embellished with colored lantern-slides.
French Consul Turck spoke the after-words
of thanks, and further voiced a hope that
other members might be inspired to follow
M. Cornioley’s oratorical example. The re-
mainder of the evening was filled in with
chat and a general endeavor to be as French
as possible.
Sailors’ Wives and Mothers’ Union mem-
bers had a good time at their monthly gather-
ing in the Independent Hall. The afternoon-
tea cake was reinforced by a sing-song served
up by sailor men from the Flinders Naval
Base under the joint directorship of Mrs.
H. M. Ramsay and the Rev. C. Hudson.
Lady Forster shed vice-regal limelight on
the meeting, and poured some welcome words
upon the new Union President, Admiral
Hall Thompson’s wife. Thereafter she
broadcasted an invitation to all bereaved
sailors’ wives and mothers to come to Govern-
ment House on Anzac Day for the special
service and afternoon tea, though she
sorrowfully added that she would herself not
be there—she will be in Brisbane on that
date. Mrs. Hall Thompson’s maiden speech
included a word on behalf of the Victory
fund, which is destined to rejuvenate Nel-
son’s historic flagship. Commander Hardy’s
wife, Mrs. Treacey (whose ex-Paymaster
husband is now secretary of the Melbourne
Club), Surgeon-Captain Phipps’s other half
and Mrs. Stokes were among the committee
members who kept things moving.
Artist Nora Wilkie, snapped here in the
Pierrette togs she sported at the Vic. Artists’
Ball, is now staging a joint exhibition with
young Geoff Anderson at the Queen’s Hall.
She is a grand-daughter of the late Dr.
Wilkie, a noted Collius-street medico, and
has revelled in
her paint-box
ever since she
was a small
child, though
owing to a
break in the
family for-
tunes in her
youth she has
never been
able to give
her talent full
play. Nowa-
days her
duties in a
city office leave
her little time
for painting,
which has to
be kept for
holidays and
week - ends.
During the
war Nora
Wilkie, who is a member of the Vic. Artists’
Society, turned her art to patriotic account
by holding a sale of her paintings in her
own home at Toorak, which enabled her to
send along a nice little £4O cheque to the
Belgian Relief Fund.
Sydney's May Summerbelle gathered vari-
ous of her sister-penwomen on the Maloja at
Port Melbourne for a farewell chat before
she steamed oft' to England with a pile of her
musical compositions under her arm. Among
the inky-wayfarers who sipped pekoe with
her was Fritz Hart's wife, an old friend of
the little Sydney musician. Maisie Maxwell,
Melbourne’s most popular presswoman, missed
the party, as she is only just able to sit up
and take notice after a severe attack of
pleurisy.
Beresford Shaw, the young tenor who
lately came to Melbourne with an eye on
the concert platform, is the son of a Banana-
land doctor, and was an Indian Army officer
before taking
to the land in
the northern
State. II e
did his bit in
the war. and
when that
little job was
over decided
to try his
luck with his
voice. to
which end he
studied under
Leonard Fran-
cis in Bris-
ban e. Th e
things said
about him
after concerts
in vari o u s
parts of the
►State encour-
aged him to
descend upon
Melbourne, where he is now having his tenor
repolished by Theophilus Roberts before fac-
ing the local critics. One or two of those
who have had a private hearing suggest that
the young man may do something in musical
comedy—-always assuming that Henry Rus-
sell and the Anglican archbish. don’t abolish
that wickedness before he gets his chance.
The Repertory Society opened up its
season at the Playhouse with Galsworthy’s
'“Loyalties." Unfortunately grand opera
blue-pencilled the vice-regal presence, and
otherwise helped to thin the house. A trio
of feminine stars got plenty of dress chances,
all starting off scratch with rival neglige
expensiyeness in a bedroom scene of a re-
spectability _ calculated to defy all conscien-
tious objections. Handsome Madge Robertson
got home first in a black silk kim. loaded
■with golden ’broideries, a red silk hanky
bandaging her dark head. Edith Fraser
spread w aves of sea-green silk foamed heavily
with white lace on either side, and had a
lace mob-cap on her golden locks. Isabel
Handley, whose wrapper was kim.-shaped
and rosy, rushed through the whole gamut
of sartorial emotions, first in rust-red tailor-
ings, then in a primrose satin sheath covered
with tulle and sashed with blue and silver
stripes, and finally in orcliid-like draperies
of georgette. Dr. Stanley Argyle forgot his
Ministerial worries in the thrills of the
Galsworthy play; and Surgeon George Syme
was'there with his wife and daughters. Mrs.
Jack Joshua brought daughter June, and
the Arthur Robinson dame her ewe-lamb
Nan. Mrs. Theyre Weigall, Mrs. George
Aitken and dozens of other Best Knowns
were present, with a whole chandelier of
’Varsity lights and, amazingly, a great roll-
up of flappers.
While at Warrnambool a few days ago
Alec Peacock was able to indulge most of
his hobbies—revel at an A.N.A. corrobc/ee
with pals of from 42 years’ to 42 months’
standing, watch the goat-riding in the Key-
stone and Compass arena, give/half-holidays
to the school kiddies of who,to he is king,
and pick up the political gossip of the sur-
rounding electorates. Having married a
South-Western District girl (Millie Holden),
he has a sort of hold on the locality, quite
apart from the work done at Warrnambool
and Colac by his late brother Andrew, the
archdeacon.
Frances Quirke, formerly well known here
in philanthropic circles, sends word that
she has been spending some time in the
French capital, which at time of writing
she declared to be the cheapest part of
Europe. Considering the price of meat and
other articles of food in Paris, one trembles
to think what the cost of living is elsewhere.
The spinster lately covered herself with glory
by having a passage of arms with a Roman
boniface who charged her an exorbitant
tariff. In the end she appealed before a
magistrate, and won, after conducting her
own case in fluent Italian.
The Northcote and Clifton Hill Auxiliaries
of the Red Cross, which divide their in-
terests between the Women’s Hospital and
our “mental’’ soldiers, have joined forces
to stage a smart jazz party in the Northcote
Town Hall on May 6 to swell their respec-
tive banking accounts. Dr. Lennox Spiers’*
popular wife and Mrs. R. Thompson are
sharing the hon. sec. responsibilities, while
the local mayoress, Mrs. W. H. Turner, is
doing her bit as president.
The sniff of a. veteran :
A grand-opera company, mainly Italian, is with us,
and for the next few months much nonsense will be
written about “the artistic temperament.” Long-
haired musicians and posing fur-coated actors are out
of date. Eminent instrumentalists —the most gifted
section of public entertainers—get their hair cut
regularly and behave like ordinary human beings;
they can be seen at hotel tables, with the evening
paper at the back of their mutton chop. Opera-
singers, however, keep up the pretence of being en-
slaved by “temperament”—that is? if their names
appear in big type on the programmes. Young strug-
gling singers can’t afford to be “temperamental”;
they would lose their jobs if they were. It is only
among the stars that these emotional disturbances
occur. They are spoilt by applause, pampered by-
paragraphs and troubled by the inevitable jealousies
arising from rivalries on the same platform. The
song-recitalist or instrumental soloist who has no
rival on the bill never suffers from “temperament”
which prevents her (or him) from appearing that even-
ing. The truth is that “temperament” is a pretence,
a self-indulgence, a vainglorious exhibition of power
to upset tli* managerial apple-cart. Often, of course,
it is just an artful means of holding dangerous com-
petition at bay. The singer threatens to chuck -up her
job if a certain other singer gets a certain other pari.
The management cannot afford to let her go, so her
demand is granted. A pork butcher’s carver might:
show as much “temperament” against a rival artist.
Drenching rain took some of the crimp
out of Hobart’s Fleet Week frills, though
they fluffed out hilariously during one sun-
shiny interval. Macintoshed and brollied
crowds surged damply through the mud to
cheer the warships’ arrival, everyone nobly
striving to appear as merry and bright as
the occasion demanded. Admiral Field
rather caught the local Pooh Bahs napping
when he made, his official calls a little in
advance of the scheduled hour, and there is
a wicked rumor that Administrator Ewing
felt all his gubernatorial dignity ooze out
when called on to receive the first naval
Cocked Hat before he had got to grips with
his matutinal razor. The Premier’s Office
crowd had to be hurriedly collected from all
quarters, and the story goes that poor Town
Clerk Brain buzzed round like an infuriated
bee to save being trapped in his underpants.
The Master Warden and his sec., being merci-
fully lower down the Admiral's calling list,
got a warning hoot, and were awaiting the
breathless moment with the easy conscious-
ness of those who have loaded their guns for
action, when a long table cluttered with
glasses, and such-like impedimenta left over
from the night before met their horrified
gaze. Thereupon the pair fell on the
debris and, after breaking all clear-the-board
records, were, screwing the mahogany back
to normal size, when the tread of the chief
naval boot resounded on the threshold.
One Jack Tar at least won't carry back
the idea that Hobart simply hates to hustle.
The bluejacket blew up to one of the city’s
oldest inhabitants who happened to be stand-
ing on the wharf with the query “How
many people live on this island?” “Two
hundred and fifteen thousand,” responded
the old gent, informatively. “Where are
they?” inquired the sailor with an inflexion
of doubt in his tone. “Working!” retorted
the ancient severely.
A little gossip from Adelaide:—
I’olo Week came to a cheerful conclusion with a
gymkhana at Birkalla and a dance at Glenelg the
same evening—the dance staged at the Pier Hotel
and jointly hostessed by r the feminine belongings of
a dozen or so enthusiastic poloists. At the gymkhana
Miss Affleck annexed a couple of trophies for Vic.,
winning both the polo ball and the flag-and-barrel
competitions. His Ex., who brought small daughter
Alvida with him and had Capt. Hambleton in attend-
ance, put in most of the afternoon at the polo
ground and handed over cups and prizes to the
winners at the end. Her Ex. has been on a flying
visit to Melbourne and the opera.
The Repertory Theatre’s staging of “The Laughing
Lady” was one of the best things it has done.
Special honors went to Catherine Neill, who not
only dressed the part of Lady Marjorie, but played
it—-which is more than can be said sometimes even
for Repertory shows. Farr, K.C., and his self-
effacing wife were Royston Marcus and Ivy Stacy,
and both did well.
North Adelaide’s Liberal women snatched a moment
from canvassing a day or two ago to foregather for
tea and chat in the Blind Institution Hall. Invitations
went out in the name of Mrs. Glover, president of
the local committee, but she -was on the sick list,
so the vice-president, Mrs. Pel lew, took her place.
Mrs. E. A. Mayfield was billed as the speaker of the
afternoon ; there were a few words from Mrs. Makin
and Mr. Maddern, and songs from Audrey Wells,
Beatrice Earon and Olive Basnett.
The Hun’s meekness doesn’t last long. Half a
dozen of him wandered about Port Adelaide a few
evenings ago singing “The Fatherland” and flourish-
ing a red flag. That, however, wasn’t to the taste
of some Scandinavians near by, who set on the
chorus, tore a good deal of its clothing off, and
removed some of its skin by rolling it in the road.
Suburban Unley has acquired an orchestra of its
own; and its first public performance was given
in the local Town Hall the other night, accompanied
by much verbal nosegay-throwing at the conductor,
Norman Sellick.

MICK SIMMONS
PROPERLY
Had anyone wanted to back Claro for
big money to win the Railway Handicap at
hill he wouldn’t have been accommodated. Quite
early in the betting the English horse was at 6 to
4 ; a little later, in many cases, it was “I’ve laid all
I want to lay,” and that wasn’t much. Yet the
flying chestnut had 9st. 131 b. to carry on a fairly
heavy track (albeit the going wasn’t nearly so bad
as had been anticipated after the drenching week-
end rain in Sydney), and there were 18 other starters,
its it happened, he was in front at the end of a
furlong and hadn’t to be ridden out by Brown to
win by three lengths from Otacre and Perspective
in lmin. 28sec, for the seven furlongs. It was a
dazzling Doncaster trial, and dynamite odds were
immediately demanded by operators on that race, but
Blaekadder, Mont Clair, All Sunshine, Duke Isinglass
and other dangerous candidates for the Randwick
mile were not in the field. Again, Laneffe’s fail
near the four-furlongs post—he burst a blood-vessel
and incontinently died —not only got rid of a
heavily-backed competitor, but spoilt the chances of
some of those behind the prostrate Queenslander,
who had been running second ; and Sunburst, when
travelling nicely, ran wide at the turn. Claro’s
brilliance is indisputable, but no horse is a good
thing for the Doncaster with 31b. short of 10 stone.
Otaere’s gallop was impressive in a quiet way, and
one expects him to finish closer to the chestnut next
time they meet.
The Hawk’s failure in the w.f.a.. Rawson Stakes
suggests that he doesn’t really care for any distance
beyond a mile. At eight furlongs he was going
w’ell alongside Whittier, who had made most of
the running, with Yaldoona keeping him company;
but over the last furlong the odds-on-favorite tra-
velled badly, and at the end there was daylight
between him and Englefield, who was a. length and
a half behind Whittier. The latter sported a band-
age on the leg which is supposed to be dicky, (the
going must have suited it), and 20’s were offered
in vain. Yaldoona, who was backed at B’s, might
have made things interesting for him if her saddle
hadn’t slipped at a critical moment, and if her
party reserves her for the Doncaster (one can’t see
such a light-framed customer winning the St. Leger
or the Sydney Cup) she will not lack friends.
Kasingwold, who looks much brighter than when
last in Sydney, ran a good race, and Rahiri shaped
fairly well.
Most of the 19 starters in the 12-furlongs Club
Handicap have engagements in the Sydney Cup. The
money came solidly for Our Prince, who looked
trained to the minute, but isn’t built on robust
lines, and there was plenty of Sydney lucre for
Master Cagou, Pennybont and Balaton, but Mirth-
maker had little support at 12’s and David less at
20’s. Mirthmaker, capricious last season, has evi-
dently grown more trustworthy with age, or it
may be his health that has improved ; at all events,
he ran the race of his life. Always in the fighting
line he came away at the turn, and towards the close
his jockey was looking round to see where Our
Prince was. The English horse finished- stoutly
after emerging from the ruck, and Drongo’s was a
rather meritorious third. Others noticed running on
well, after being badly placed in the first half-
mile, were Highlander and Balaton, who are being
raced into fine form. But nothing could have beaten
Vfirthmaker on the day.
Valiant cut up badly in the Three-vear-old Handicap,
for which he was backed to heat The Monk at a
difference of 111 b. In September there would have
been another 141 b. between them at least. The
beautiful Absurd colt, who was favorite at 7 to 4,
ran home an easy winner from Trilisa and Laka-
wr nna, but Trilisa’s appearance indicated that she
needed a few more gallops. With these and 271 b.
off her back, she must still be regarded as a Doncaster
possibility. Perhaps a mile is too far for The Monk.
The divided Juvenile Stakes was a bookmakers'
benefit. There may have been a pound or two for
Magician (20’s), but Meenah (33’s) was unbacked
in the ring; her tote price was 34 }to 1 on a three-
divs. implement. Nevertheless, MeShortodds never
laid better than 2 to 1 about Prince Woorak in the
Parramatta Mile, although there were 15 starters
and the Woorak gelding is an indifferent performer.
The time is rotten-ripe for a 10s. s.o. machine.
A spirited bit of riding on Toohey’s part enabled
Royal Dighton’s backers to collect. This interesting
black colt is very like his relative Dighton .n
appearance }md is developing on much the same
lines. He may be worth bearing in mind for a mile
or a mile and a quarter handicap at Randwick.
At the moment this page likes All Sunshine for the
Doncaster and Mirthmaker for the Sydney Cup.

“0.K.”: The Blackadder stable bases its
optimism regarding the Doncaster on the belief that
its steed would have won the Newmarket under
happier conditions. How he came to lose his position
next the outside rails, and finish inside of Quintus
and Una Carlos, was not explained in the press at
the time, otherwise Blackadder would have received
more credit for having split the Newmarket pair,
who ran first and third in another sprint four days
later. On the other hand, the optimists seem to
overlook the fact that by Doncaster day eight
weeks will have elapsed since Blackadder ran tie
second of his good races in Melbourne. And he may
not be one of those cast-iron horses that keep their
condition for months.
“D.” : The Methodists of N. S. Wales are
as untiring in their attacks on the gambling evil
as Archbishop Wright is in his yearly assault on
the opening of the Sydney Show to the public on
Good Friday. Everyone appreciates the Archbishop’s
standpoint, but how many can see the logic of
Methodism’s? At the last Conference, for example,
there were denunciations of art unions and the Tote.
An art union is, properly speaking, not a gamble at
all. The immediate thrill, which is the essence and
poison of the gambling spirit, is wanting. The Tote
is the rival, and might be made the conqueror of
the bookmaker. The logical French force pari-mutuel
speculators .to contribute millions of francs annually
towards the upkeep, inter alia, of the roads leading to
Longchamps, etc., and talk of a lottery (or State-run
art union) to meet some of their pressing war commit-
ments. It is business, and tends rather to decrease
than to increase the speculative spirit which is in-
herent in all human beings. While marvelling at
the illogicality of the Methodists, which impels them
to conduct a campaign against the most innocuous
known forms of gambling, in the interests of the
worst (i.e., ring and starting-price betting), it is
impossible not to admire their selflessness. The art
unions, rottenly as some of them are' run, help
materially to support the hospitals which Methodists
use with the rest of the community, and if book-
making were rigidly suppressed and the Tbte profits
used for debt reduction, the non-racing Methodists
of the State would be staggered before long at the
resulting drop in their taxation assessments.

“W.H.C.” (Loud.) : I have lived to see a
horse fall down and win. It happened at Sandown
Park on February 28, in a steeplechase for hunters
ridden by artillery officers. With about six
furlongs to go, one steed was almost a fence in the
lead when over it toppled. Before the jockey was
in the saddle again (he had a nasty spill) two
others had passed him. Nothing daunted, he got
going again, was almost on terms at the final fence,
and was showing his mount’s heels to them in the
run home. Even MeShortodds joined in the cheer
which greeted horse and rider when they returned
to weigh in.
BILL HAYES, secretary of the Victorian
Club.
Adelaide : A notable feature of the
recent p*olo matches at Adelaide was the prowess of
Winter Irving, who has lost his left hand. The
Victorian keeps his reins fastened to his left arm;
his right hand can always get across in emergency,
but he has a true horseman’s grip with knees and
thighs, and his ponies are trained to understand.
When he won outright an event in the gymkhana
the applause was thunderous.

“B. Bargee” : There was au old skippers’
race on Sydney Harbor the other day, and an ancient
waxed garrulous over the sandwiches and bottled ale.
“’They talk a lot aboilt eafnber keels and rater
designs,” lie wheezed. “Why, the Australia, built
65 years ago. had a camber keel. They raced over
full-sized courses when I was in the game. From
Pinchgut round Shark Island to Manly, and back
round Shark Island and round the Manly buoy

again and home —that was the course, inside the
harbor. Then there were ocean races nearly every
Saturday. Even one-tenners took part. In the
smaller classes the sizes were 16- to 18-, 22- and 24-
footers. There was nothing smaller than that till
you came down to the 6ft. and 10ft. canvas dinghies,
and they could sail, let me tell ye. Seen ’em beat
a big yacht. The 18-footers were the ones. Crews
of 35 they carried, all Hanging out to windward. I
remember the lolanthe and the Assegai, in the six-
ton class—they were always having neck-and-ncek
goes. And the Awanui and Tarawera and other
Maoriland boats that used to come over to race in
the big races. Yes, they were good boats in the
old times. Nothing like ’em to-day.”
* * * *
Bert Ristuccia, the Vic. lightweight, and
George Fox, the Englishman, were so anxious to
make good on their first appearance at Sydney
Stadium that their controversy was quite thrilling
for a time. Georgius rushed in to annihilate the
tall youth from Melbourne, his right swinging from
all angles. One of his wild clouts felled Ristuccia
for nine seconds, and the latter limped to his corner
after unsuccessfully appealing for a foul. Another
enthusiastic punch connected with the Victorian’s
c hin, and seven seconds of the third round he spent
on the floor. But after that he boxed his man and,
being mu< h the better boxer, he soon had Fox in
trouble. Blood poured from the Englishman’s left
r.ve, and darkness enveloped that organ in the sixth.
During the minute’s respite the referee thoughtfully
invited him to surrender, but he stoically endured
another miserable round before his seconds arranged
an armistice on his behalf. His gameness earned
him the cheers of the crowd besides a cheque for
All 04.

“Privateer”: A Tasmanian paper put it
this way:—•
“At Newark, New Jersey, a Georgia schoolboy
named Youn>\ a mere stripling, decisively whipped
Mike McTigue, the light-heavyweight champion of
the world.
The mere stripling in question has twice beaten
MqPTigue, but on, ea.eh ocasion lie fought under his
ring title of Young Stribling. When the wires
hummed with the earth-shaking news from Broken
Hill that Thorn (9.5) had licked Armstrong (9.7),
another Speck journal came out with the subjoined
headlines:

Jack Reedman, dead in Adelaide at 57,
was a cricketer just on the edge of international
rank 30 years ago. He got into one Test match in
Sydney, and his great disappointment was that he
was —though much discussed for it —left out of the
Australian XI of 1893. With Blinman and Walter
Giffen he did much to help the bigger men, George
Giffen, Lyons and A. H. Jarvis, to put Adelaide on
the map in cricket. South Aus. was on top in
1891-92, just before Lord Sheffield gave the Shield,
and won it just after it was given. Reedman was
also an inter-State footballer for years, and after
retirement was an enthusiastic coach to younger men
in all sports. His sons are prominent, mainly in
swimming.

“Trekle” : Prahran had to struggle hard
for a place in this year’s Melbourne four (B. 27/3/’24)
because the team was too good. Sometimes it met
strong opposition aiid defeat when Wallace, Ellis,
Grimmett and Willis were representing the State,
and Gerald Healy was unable to play. Gerald was
perhaps the most missed, for although the selectors
are always cold to him he has been for years the
most stylish and successful batsman in the club.
With all these stars available for the finals, Prahran
should take their fourth consecutive pennant. They
have most to fear from St. Ivilda, who are now on
top, but this even batting side has the procession habit
when Ponsford fails ; bowlers Ironmonger and Blackie,
however,, are always reliable. If Northoote took the
flag, no one should be surprised, for Hartkopf is
versatile enough to carry them to victory by his own
efforts, and ‘Carroll, Yeomans and Woodbury are
bright stars in a team that carries no incompetents.
Melbourne lias fine bats in Ransford, Sandford, Onyons
and Tolhurst, and a coming champion express ir,
Ebeling, but its chance for the premiership left foi
England with M’arwick Armstrong.
“Simplon”: I once saw Hum-
phreys, the lol> bowler (B. 3/4/’24).
take the shine out of a Ballarat XV
on the Eastern Oval. Though only
a kiddy at the time, I can well re-
member the broad grins in the stand
when the podgy Englishman started
feeding the batsmen with soft stuff.
But the merriment ceased when the
wily old ’un collected two wickets in
rapid succession, one caught and the
other clean bowled, and when the
local champion was also dismissed
the silence was deeper than that of
a Communist meeting singing the
British National Anthem. The fallen
hope of his side was ruefully taking
iff his pads when a barraeker addressed
him. “Fancy you gettin’ beat by
under-’and bowlin’,” said the non-
playing gent. “That’s just the
trouble,” the victim groaned. “It’s
too blanky ‘under-’and.’ ”
» * *
“Patto” : One of the pathetic
sports in America is cricket, which
still lingers in isolated spots, much to
the amazement of the populace, its
survival depends mostly upon the
efforts of exiled Aussies, some of
whom I met in New York last summer.
Thinking to give me a whiff of home,
artist Walter Jardine, now residing
in Gotham, invited me to a
match at Staten Island. Quite a
crowd of Aussies was there. I was
sitting in the pavilion, absorbed in
the game and thinking how homely it
all was, when a gent, alongside, sport-
ing a blazer coat and a straw hat with
a colored band, affably addressed me.
He said: “i’ll tell the woild the toil’s
fast this aflternoon.” Another illusion
shattered.
“S.T.S.”: Wisden’s Annual, just to hand,
shows clearly once more that, in England at any
rate, matches are won by bowlers rather than batsmen.
Yorkshire had an unprecedented season, playing 32
county matches and losing only one (by three runs,
to Nottingham). Yet in the batting averages they
are simply nowhere, a level lot ranging from 3ti
down. The country’s best bats were Hendren (77),
Mead (59), Makepeace and Hearne (just under 50).
Hobbs was only 37. In bowling, however, Yorkshire
heads the list with Rhodes, Kilner and Macaulay, all
from 11 to 13, and Robinson close up. Yet Tate of
Sussex (under 14) seems to be reckoned the country’s
best bowler. He took most wickets (219), and
Parkin, the humorist, was the only other with over
200. The all-rounders’ figures are: Hearne, 47 and
20 ; Kilner, 34 and 12 ; Rhodes, 33 and 11; Woolley,
41 and 19 ; Gilligan (considered a likely captain for
England), 21 and 17 ; Fender (called by Wisden an
“unequalled” captain for Surrey),, 29 and 19 ; Doug-
las, 29 and 22. '

“Bail”: It looks as if Percy Wallace, of
Prahran (Vic.), will get a fast-Dow ler’s job in
the next Australian XL There is apparently no
possibility of McDonald retiring from the lucrative
billet he holds in Britain, and there is still
a doubt about Gregory’s knee, although Jack is con-
fident that it won't go back on him again. Whether
Gregory is available or not, Wallace’s chances will
be good, as the selectors will probably be impressed
by the necessity of having two fast bowlers to open
hostilities and subsequently relieve each other so that
the attack can be maintained. Wallace is an excep-
tionally lucky cricketer. He was rushed into the
Vic. XI after only four years of p’enffidTt - cricket,
and had the extraordinary experience of playing .n
four States in his first season. In my opinion he
is a long way behind McDonald and Gregory, and
hasn't the vital energy of the late “Tibby” Cotter,
but he does have his “days,” and on those occasions
his averages talk.
* * * *
“Machete”: How is it that Sydney Uni.
has not yet managed to raise a Soccer team ? The
Association game is booming all over Australia, and
the N.S.W. Soccer authorities have been talking
about the notion for a long time, but nothing has
been done. The Union and League codes do not
absorb half the students who would like to play
football of some sort. Most of the lads who go up
to the University from the Soccer-playing schools
—and there are a lot of them —either drop the
game or turn to Rugby. Yet there is an easy-going
Soccer rule which permits amateur and pro. to
play together or against each other ; .this would open
the door to a lot of young fellows who can’t play
Union and are afraid to play League.

The 76th English university boat-race
went to Cambridge on Saturday, making their total
of wins 35 against Oxford’s 40, and one dead-heat. The
Light Blues must have been a very good crew in-
deed, for not only did they win easily, by 4i
lengths, but, never really pressed, they put up the
second best time in Putney-Mortlake annals, 18min.
41sec. Still, time tests are inconclusive on the
Thames and in a climate like England’s April.
None the less Cambridge confounded the critics, who
gave them scant chance up till the last two or
three weeks. Their rapid improvement just before
the race was admitted, but Oxford, accounted a
stronger and more experienced crew, started favorites.
Australasia was unrepresented in either boat.
* * * *
“Hambone”: Sydney High, for years re-
garded as the Cinderella of N.S.W. public schools
in sport, is losing its place at the bottom of com-
petition ladders. Last season the High footballers
rattled some of the strongest teams, and before the
end of the year they had trounced Grammar at
cricket. The 1923 captain, Era Henry, was crack
of the G.P.S. swimmers, and will represent Australia
at the Olvmnic Games. For the first time, High will
enter the regatta business this year. Peter Kemp is
building a four, and Charlie Towns is combining
the tuition of maths with the teaching of a perfect
swing to four muscular High boys.

The Bulletin
THE INKY WAY.
Included in a long list of A.J.A. members published
in the current number of the Australasian Journal-
ist one encounters “\V. M. Hughes, Daily Telegraph,
Sydney. This is understood to be the last industrial
union of which William retains membership.
“Lauraliada" (Moresby): I see there must have
been another Washington Conference. Our local
Thunderer puts it this way: “Arrangements have
been completed to sink the Australia six miles out
at sea from Sydney Heads on April 12th. The
Australian fleet and the visiting British fleet will go
down with flags flying.”
“Sierra”: Why is it that modern writers fight shy
of the perfectly good word “said”? I have jus;
found two characters who “breathed,” “flashed,"
“flamed,” “blazed,” “shrilled,” “pursued,” “came
back,” “mused,” “countered,” “mocked,” “parried,”
“persisted” and “gibed” ; but neither of them ever
<«oe “said” anything.
“P.A.L.”: Run during the past few years as a
modest little diocesan sheet, the Month, edited
by that good journalist, Bishop Cleary, of Auckland
(M.L.), has appeared in a more ambitious form and
circulates all over the Dominion. Archbishop Red-
wood’s jubilee'gave Cleary an opportunity of pinn-
ing the Month, and he didn’t miss it.
“To Pana”: Charlie ISicol (Herald, Auckland),
Jim Carson (Star, Auckland) and Andy Burns
(Lyttleton Times, Christchurch) manage to hold
responsible jobs on the literary stall's of those ILL.
papers despite the fact that they are each short of
an arm. And Vincent Ryder for some time found
that the loss of a leg did not prevent him chasing
pars for an Auckland news-sheet.
“J.F.11.”: Lord Northcliffe left a curiously compli-
cated will, with which Ids executors and their
lawyers have been energetically wrestling for a
long time. They are now appealing to the Court for
light and guidance on no less than 30 doubtful points.
Meanwhile, the handsome legacies left by the journal-
istic Napoleon to numerous pen-pushers and heads of
departments are held up. It is alleged that they
amount in the aggregate to £ 750,000, but that is
probably an exaggerated estimate.
“Privateer”: Passed out in Hobart, Harry
Judd, who joined the now defunct Tas-
manian News 32 years ago, and later trans-
ferred to the Mercury. For some years he
represented that paper on the West Coast mining
fields, later taking charge of the Launceston office;
and two years ago he returned to the Hobart staff.
Photography was his hobby, and some years back he
produced a guide to the West Coast, illustrated by
himself. His only son, Jack, is on the Hobart
World.
“Manuka”: The Wairoa (M.L.) Bell has ceased
to tinkle on the gumdigiana of North Auckland,
having been bought out by a local contemporary
after a reign of nearly 40 years. The late John
.Stallworthy, one time Liberal member for Kaipara,
established the paper at Oargaville, and the property
remained in the same family until the day of going
to press for the last time arrived. The Bell (lid
signal service in lightening the burdens of the mill-
hands and gumdiggers, and was known from end to
end of Maoriland as a mighty thunderer for prohibi-
tion ; but the district preferred to remain wet.
The latest stunt of the editor of an aggressive
evening paper was to place in a prominent position
in the office a large blackboard whereon he wrote
each day his opinion, varying from faint praise to
downright condemnation, of the various features m
the. previous evening’s paper. Thus: “Mr. Rounds-
man's report of the Smutt Divorce Case-y Fair.
“Mr. Sharthand’s account of Mr. Dawson's disagree-
ment with the Country Party—Bad”—and so o:i.
The staff stood it uncomplainingly for a time; then
someone revolted, and one morning all hands were
delighted to see chalked boldly on the board: “Edit-
ing—Rotten.”
“J.F.11.” (London) : In the current issue of Notes
and Queries is an inquiry for the name of the author
of “The Australian Babes in the Wood,” a book of
which, I confess, I never heard before. It was
published anonymously, it seems, in 1866, with illus-
trations by J. Whinter and Hugh Cameron, distin-
guished painters of that period. It bore the sub-
title of “A True Story Told in Rhyme for the
Young,” and the only clue to the identity of the
writer is the statement that it is by the author of
“Little Jessie,” a story published anonymously in
Edinburgh in 1856. The writer of the latter is
understood to have been Sarah Maria Fry, who
specialised on the composition of moral and religious
stories for children. Has Australia any definite in-
formation to offer about it ?
“Pedro”: Always some Gadarene swine of a word
bestrides a newspaper like a vocal Colossus and
demands to be used and misused all the time, i
have witnessed the dynasties of “potentialities,
“protagonist,” “finalisation,” “intriguing,” ‘bro-
mides,” and other tyrants, and seen them rise and
fall like the empires we read about. The latest
despot is “fabricate.” Of old when we said that
a man had fabricated something we meant that he
was a liar. But someone concerned with the Sydne)
harbor bridge said that the bridge would be fabri-
cated locally, and the word acquired recognition in
a sense which is perfectly according to Webster, ot
course, but had lapsed into innocuous desuetude, as
you might say. Yet there has been a vast amount
of the ‘old “fabrication” about the bridge. The
number of Ministries that promised to build it and
didn’t is beyond count. Even as late a \\ orks
Minister as j. H. Cann twice passed a bill through
the Assembly. But in his ease the Council saved
him further trouble.
“Direke Jansen”: Australian “journalese” of 1H
years ago reads strangely to-day. Sample: “After
the cloth was removed the rosy deity asserted his
pre-eminence, and, with the zealous aid of Momus
and Apollo, chased pale Cynthia down into the
western world. The blazing orb of day announced
his near approach, and the God of the Chariot reluc-
tantly forsook his company; Bacchus dropped his
head, and Momus could no longer animate, j ne
bon vivants no longer relishing the tired dieties,
broke up and left them to themselves.” In plain
English, after supper tables had been cleared the
gentlemen cut loose on the wine and generously
liquored up till dawn. It was the Sydney Gazette >
description of the conclusion of Sydney’s first race-
ball, held on October 19, 1810. Incidentally, of that
race meeting the Gazette said: “From this excellent
institution we may hope the important advantage ot
amending the breed of the most useful and noble
animal that Nature has bestowed on man.” We
started that guff early. Of all the horses entered
for the races there was only one that was not a
gelding.
“M.D.”; “Te Pana” (B. 6/3/’24) suggests that
writers on the South Seas forget or hide rhe fact
that the natives have cutaneous and lymphatic
systems, mostly diseased. This is quite tiue.
O’Brien’s effusions are merely illustrated guidebooks
which feature elegant unclad hetairae who lean negli-
gently against rocks in the foreground. Gauguin,
who was intoxicated with island life and who 'went
native ” would have written something of permanent
value’had not his soul been given up to the sister
art of painting. “R.L.S.” was too comfortable a.
Vailima —he loved to pose as Tusitala ot the gemle
Samoans—and his health was too precarious to pernrt
him getting within miles of the proper “South sea
atmosphere.” He got nearest to it in The Beach o
Falesa ” His Vailima letters might have come from
Redfern. Rupert Brooke was young, a poet and a
worshipper of Beauty, so he basked in the simles ot
the tiare-erowned Mamua, wrote sugary stuff, and
raved over the scarlet blossoms ot the flamboyants
(.poHciana) and the intoxicating odors of tiaiv
and frangipanni. You could not expect him to think
of filariasis and elephantiasis while bathing wirb
Mamua. To get the proper perspective a_ writer would

isfen
For Shearing.
The picture above shows 20 of the 42
Lister stands in the Midkin (N.S.W.) shed.
From the engine, through all the overhead
transmission gear, right down to the cutters,
Lister has proved its superiority in efficiency
and long life. After shearing or crutcliing
41,000 sheep, one expert, speaking of the
Lister Tension Nut with the Self-Levelling
Crown Plate, says:—“This nut has required
no attention whatever since I first put it
into use”—one reason why so many people
are finding it profitable to re-equip with
Lister.
For Power.
Messrs. W. H. Treweeke & Sons, of Ross-
more, Burren Junction, N.S.W., say :—“We
don’t think we can say very much about the
Lister Engine. There may be engines as
good, but we have not seen them.”
When working on the farm (not in the
showroom) Lister Engines “prove their
mettle,” and as power units for shearing,
pumping, lighting, sawing, etc., they are
helping hundreds of sheepmen to minimise
the cost of working their properties, besides
making their homes brighter and their
worries lighter.
For Crutching.
The Lister Portable Plant is popular
because it provides in cheap and compact
form the same reliability and clean work
as a shed plant. What is more, that very
commendable feature —cheap running cost —
is borne out by the following from Mr. C.
McConnell, of Lockhart, N.S.W.: —“We
have just finished crutching at Lockhart; in
about six weeks’ run we put through
28,989 sheep and used 7 tins of petrol and
one gallon gas-engine oil, at a total cost of
£5/15/6. This will take some beating.”

Front the first bar of the overture to final
curtain-fall things were well done in every
case at Melbourne Majesty's last week. In
one respect they had never before been so
consistently well done in Melbourne. The
unexpected smartness of the “Lucia” setting
hinted at this, and the suspicion was con-
firmed by impressive spectacular effects at
the end Of the Church scene in “Tosca,” with
the chorps prayerfully arranged, while a
long, slow procession of soldiers and saints
moved harmoniously to devotions in the back-
ground. ! The procession was true to the
musical melodrama which “Tosca” is. Puc-
cini’s music, beautifully melodious in its
sentimental bearings, and strikingly inter-
pretative ;in tragic moments, is dominated by
the action of the story, and the acting in
this production has more subtlety and in-
tensity, as well as higher coloring, than we
got from John McCormack, Wayda and
Scandianj a dozen years ago. Lina Sca-
vizzi, in the name-part, made a quite brilliant
success, although her smooth, strong soprano
is in no 1 way remarkable. She plays the
imperious, jealous beauty as picturesquely
as Mrs. Brown Potter did, and with more
finished ijrt. Richly gowned, she looks the
character! when she enters, and remains con-
vincing to the end. Equally satisfactory
was the B aron Scarpia introduced by Apollo
Granforte, a tall man with a strong, sym-
pathetic baritone voice, expressive eyes and
a commanding mannah. Perhaps he made
Scarpia a trifle too lecherous, a little too
much of the fiend. But he was an arresting
personality in two senses of the word. Luigi
Cilia, a good second tenor in “Lucia,” gave
a broadly melodramatic performance of
Scarpia’s police-agent, who sings very little.
The cringing agent lias been compared to
Uriah Ileep, but he cringed more on the lines
of an Irish informer in a Boucicault drama.
Azzolini, I the very Italian low comedian oi’
the co., jivas a more effective sacristan in
“Tosca” than he had been an ancient ass
in “Boherne” ; and Nino Piccaluga, the tenor,
did very well as tortured Mario, the victim
of Scarpia’s ill intent. The chorus work
showed rbughnesses in “Tosca,” but a new
conductors, Arnaldo Schiavoni, got some
thrilling effects from the orchestration.
“Rigoletto,” on the Thursday, brought Dai
Monte to the fore again, the sweet keenness
of her Warble being responsible for what
was m’ostl charming in a handsomely-staged
but insufficiently rehearsed performance of
Verdi’s early opera. Her Gilda was a plump,
tender, persuasive little prey to the prowling
Duke, and her “Caro Nome” had a glorious
trill. But here, as in “Lucia,” her gown,
ing, facial make-up and false hair seemed
strangely unworthy of her crystal top-notes.
Granforte, who played the hunchback Jester
with more stoop than hunch, was -chiefly
powerful in pathos. His big baritone had
mapy tears in it, and his eyes spoke more

eloquently of anxiety about his ewe-lamb
than of malice and revengefulness. Di Lelio,
as murderous Sparafucile, was again a satis-
factory basso, his voice showing more quality
than quantity. Nobody would have blamed'
the earnest assassin for not knifing the Duke
(under contract to Rigoletto) had he not
committed the historic error of slaying Gilda
in ,the petty potentate’s stead. ' This for
thej mere sake of putting a body in a sack.
Boiigioli, the serious, elegantly-proportioned
tenor of the co., lacked lightness as the
Duke; but his voice, though unequal to a
star rendering of “La Donna e Mobile,” was
pleasing, and his bearing in the garden with
Gilda, and in the ominous corpse-factory by
the riverside, was notably graceful. Unfor-
tunately his face was obtrusively grease-
painted, as in “Lucia.” Incidentally* it may-
be said that prima-donna Dal Mont.e, despite
her shortness of neok and amide Blilmfiness,
has the grace of a born artist. Among the
least-considered virtues of the “Rigoletto”
performance are a bright human equipment
of the opening scene, and the snap of the
tnale chorus in those numbers which pro-
bably set the pattern for the best humorous
choruses in classic comic opera. The weakest
feature of the show was the contralto char-
acter, played by Carmen Tornari. Her act-
ing had no allurement, whereas it is sup-
posed to lure young men to their death at
Sparafucile’s hands, and her small voice re-
duced the famous quartette in the last scene
to a three-toned affair. Paolantonjo con-
ducted capitally, but there was evidence that
the ensemble would be finer after further
rehearsal. One felt that the united forces
would get more out of the opera by Friday
this week, when it will be repeated.
* * * *
“Butterfly,” familiar to most of the audi-
ence in English, brought the fourth prima
donna to light on Friday. The staging
bettered previous productions in the second
act, by giving a pretty view of Butterfly's
garden, where the lurking figure of Goro, the
marriage-marketeer, and finally the fateful
figure of the real Mrs. Pinkerton, were effec-
tively shown. Kate Pinkerton (Ruby
Dixson), posed charmingly at the open win-
dow, amounted to a more expressive item
than in previous stagings of Puccini’s most
popular opera. A little more action, too,
distinguished the chorus business in the first
act, and it could be said for Augusta Con-
cato (a satisfactory soprano, with a ten-
dency to force her high notes) that hers was
the most emotional performance of the name-
part; Melbourne had heard. "One Fine Day.”
as Concato gives it, means more than an
ordinary concert-platform singing of the
same thing. On the other hand the appear-
ance of the lady was disappointing, in so far
that her height required her to stoop like a
Rigoletto, and her attempt at a Japanese
countenance was poor. Moreover, the orches-
tra was often too loud. Suzuki (Carmen
Tornari) was well enough portrayed, but
the contralto lady lacks force vocally and
otherwise. Lalfi and Cilia adequately filled
small parts v while Luigi Ceresol (the Mar-
cel of “Bolieme”) was a tuneful and impres-
sive Consul Sharpless, and Piccaluga was the
naval-lieutenant who causes all the woe.
He sang as usual—a good dramatic tenor
with some sweetness of acted up
to the part’s limited responsibilities. Re-
vivals of operas already produced wall keep
the house crowded until Saturday, when
Melba in “Otello” will turn money away.
In “Sleeping Partners,” at Melbourne
1 alace, the gaiety of the French coinedy
which Seymour Hicks has Anglicised enables
it to be made fascinating in three acts by
three characters only. The wife, the hus-
band and the lover are the lone trio. The
I rench original was more explicit and less
proper, but the main idea has been preserved.
A practised Don Juan lures a delightful mar-
ried woman to his bachelor rooms one even-
ing and soothes her trepidations with a
strong sleeping draught instead of sal
volatile. She is thus left to slumber soundly
when she was meant to be gently repulsing
the bad man s advances. “I hoped to be a
lover, said Seymour Hicks, “but find myself
a night-watchman.” A liappv ending is
assured by the husband also having been
away all night, and likewise getting dosed
with sleeping-draughts in mistake for sal vol
the end of the sparkling farce is sliglitlv
attenuated by Hicks’s disposition to “gag”
Ins lines-—a liberty which, when detected, is
nearly always resented by Australian audi-
ences However, the unfettered personality and
artistic abandon of Hicks carry “Sleeping
1 ertners along like a cork on a flowing
tide.. Miss Terriss, in wonderful clothes, is
a sweetly-demure wife, and Frederick Lloyd
is the husband who probably made liis be-
ll a vior more accountable in the French origi-
* * * *
As Scrooge in the curtain-raiser—an un-
conventional Scrooge whose miserliness and
reformation are compressed into tabloid
form as though for vaudeville purposes—
Seymour Hicks achieved a remarkable and a
memorable success. The condensation of
the Dickens carol is presented in a Dickens
spirit by Frank Dunn, Emma Temple, Nor-
man Lee. Sanford Milroy and others. The
visions that appeal to Scrooge have a charm
in their simplicity, and the strength of the
awakened miser’s kindliness served to uplift
the house last Saturday. It was a triumph
ot forceful acting.
Melbourne’s frivolous musical comedies,
being |not art” but merely entertainment,
look thin and pale for the moment. Never-
tlieless The Cabaret Girl” continues frivol-
ously and unashamedly at the Royal, while
“Little Nellie Kelly” maintains lief last
weeks at the Princess’s. Grand opera
frowns at suck things, but they reply with
a pout of defiance.
4,t Aieiboufne King's dignified clergy are
invited to come and see the guileless charac-
ter of “Bluebeard's Eighth Wife.” Unfor-
tunately the invitation clashes with Lent,

and to hope that an archbish. will enter a
playhouse these times is as futile as the
offer of a free pork supper to a devout Jew.
The week’s best picture-show:—
A fresh lot of Miss Cumbrae Stewart’s pastels at
the Melbourne Athenaeum reveals the “prettiness”
which has ever characterised her work in this medium.
None of her women could put away a good meal of
corned beef and carrots. The ladies even in Miss
Stewart’s portraits seem to be qualifying for pro-
motion to the seraphim. As for her general types,
they are almost unbearably sweet and gentle. They
sit about in discreet nudity, pretending to be colum-
bines or Oriental slaves, and sometimes are caught
in devotional attitudes, like the onee-fashionable
maidens of old fienner’s creation. As pieces of draw-
ing, of course, they have strong claims to con-
sideration. The modelling is especially good—
except in the hands of No. 35, which are big and
unsightly—and the high lights caressing voting con-
tours are often brilliantly presented. In landscape
Miss Cumbrae Stewart plies her pastels with more
artistic effect. “Blackfriars Bridge” and some
sketches around Dinan are v§ry agreeable.
Galsworthy’s “Loyalties,” staged by the
Melbourne Repertory Co. at the Playhouse
last week, strains the resources of this ama-
teur organisation. Its live scenes were too
numerous for the producers, Isabel Handley
and Helton Daniell, and the 19 characters
(22 in the published version of the play)
almost used up the personnel : yet the only
palpable misfits were the butler, the police-
inspector and lawyer Twisden, whose youth
stared through their elderly make-up. Other-
wise the performance was generally a suc-
cess, notwithstanding that Charles Winsor,
owner of Meldon Court, dared to be a Helton
Daniell now and again, while Miss Handley
was not quite the type that Mabel Dancy re-
presents. The humor of the British military
person, with liis imbecile devotion to false
points of honor, was curiously emphasised
by the diffidence of Harold Harwood; Stan-
ley Smith was sufficiently intense as De
Levis; and Russell Gourlay, as Captain
Ronald Dancy, was estimable in all respects.
Conspicuous among the door-openers, small
talkers , and sundries were Madge Morrison
and Edith Fraser as Margaret Orme and
Lady Adela —Miss Morrison especially was
charming.
Charlie Chaplin’s historic shuffle and slap-
stick are again visible in “Pay Day,” at
Melbourne Majestic. The film is a humorous
work of genuine art. The same bouse fea-
tures the superfluous question. “Can a
Woman Love Twice?” and in “The Ninety
and Nine” relates with fresh trimmings the
parable of the black sheep that wandered
away from the* fold. Hoyt’s star “Bavu,”
a long and lingering tragedy wherein Sylvia
Bremer has a place, and Katherine Mac-
donald in “The Scarlet Lily” is also an
attraction. But Norma Talmadge in “Within
the Law” is giving the most artistic per-
formance. Norma’s bust heavings and flash-
ing eyes are pictured about twice life-size
at the Gaiety.
At Sydney Royal there is a double bill
for the Emelie Polini farewell season— “A

Havril' about it. tlib theft of a ruby from ail
Indian idol bringing quite a satisfying quan-
tity of blood and horror in its train. Frank
Harvey plays “The Toff” with spirit and
adroitness. “French Leave,” which is not
new to Sydney, is a clever and amusing
farce, wherein the Polini lady has an oppor-
tunity to show that she is just as much
at home in a part demanding lightness and
coquetry as when the deeper emotions are
being stirred. She presents a piquant and
roguish Julie. Frank Harvey gives an
admjrable rendering of the stalwart captain
whose feelings have to be played upon.
Leslie Holland, who undertook the part at
a moment’s notice, is a convincing General
Root; Herbert Leigh and John Fernside
supply whips of comedy as Corporal Sykes
and Rifleman Jenks; Rosamond McMillan.
Harvey Adams and Raymond Lawrence com-
plete a capable cast.

At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, “The Maid of
the Mountains” displaces “Sybil,” on Satur-
day night. This record-breaker among comic
operas should mean another bushel of laurels
for Gladys Moncrieff and Claude Flemming.
“Ttjns Of Mhney” continues to go with a
tattle at Sydney Opera Housb:
Irene Vanbrugh and Dion Boucicault will
switch off Pinero on Saturday at Sydney
Cri. The new piece is Lonsdale’s "Aren’t
We A11V” presented for the first time in
Australia, with a J. M. Barrie playlet, “The
Will,” for curtain-raiser.
Renie Riano has been added to the forces
of Sydney Tivoli. This lady, according to
the latest report, has her legs insured for
tw r o and a quarter millions; and that seems
unfair to her tongue, for besides her dancing,
which sparkles, she has a tolerable flow of
vocal melody and humor. Carr Lynn, the
bird and animal imitator, has just been
canonised by the Abo. Council for his excel-
lent fowlyard and jungle impersonations:
and Florence Yayman is back again, and
with Bella Orna, the trapezist, helps to put
the finish on a fair bill.
“The Virginian,” appearing at Sydney
Lyceum and the Lyric Winter Garden, is one
of those. balanced films that fill the average
“fan” with a feeling of utter content. Also to
be seen at the Lyric is “The Spanish Dancer”
—a Romany maid who pioks up bluebloods
and turns the granite hearts of dukes into
pats of butter. The visiting Jack Tars are
expected to revel in the Empress, where
the i star draw is “The Silent Command.”

Edmund Fisher wants encores:—
The attitude of a large majority of the first-night
audience towards “Lucia” indicated that modern
Melbourne knows less about oh l Italian operas than
did the public of W. S. Lytter’s time. Having
been warned in the press regarding the sin of letting
off applause to break the continuity of Puccini
operas and the like, the crowd at Melbourne Majesty’s
refrained from putting its hands together at the
conclusion of even the famous sestet, which lias
often been encored in the same theatre. When De
Vere Sapio, Dani, Bozzoli, Cannonieri and Tondini
were associated in the good old conspiracy of sound,
23 years ago, the audience insisted on a repetition
of the sestet. Even ordinary low-brow opera-goers
had then learned the difference between music that
forbade interruption and compositions which asked
for it. 'Jjucia” asks for it, like all Italian operas
written before Mascagni and Leoncavallo pioneered
the new school. Donizetti and his immediate suc-
cessors expected voices to get their second wind
whilst their audiences carried on the tumult. But,
having learned to say “Hush!” to the interrupters
oi modern works, the majority (who didn’t know)
put a damper on the old hands last week, and the
sesteteers, after beamingly bowing to the applause,
were astonished to find it cease suddenly. The same
surprise befell the prima donna after her full stop
in the Mad Scene. There was a brief furore, which
she took as a matter of course, and then it suddenly
collapsed, whereas continued applause would have
brought the encore that everybody wanted, but
which was not insisted upon because it was supposed
to be “bad form.”
“Pollio”: Never have I seen “The Tales
of Hoffmann,” produced as its composer in-
tended. The doll scene has invariably been
degraded into a sort of bastard slapstick
pantomime. A thoughtful producer—especi-
ally a producer who is so sensitive about
bare legs as Henry Russell —might for once
try to present Offenbach’s one serious opera
as a coherent whole. The scene of Act 1
is the house of a rich and learned man in
the 18th century, and the costumes and
behavior of the characters should corres-
pond. The doll’s costume ought to be that
of a rich man’s daughter of those times,
with feet barely showing; her mechanical
strut should be just a slight caricature of
the slow, stiff walk adopted by 18th-century
ladies. Not until tlie machinery goes wrong
is there any need for buffoonery, and even
then it should not destroy our sympathy
for the deluded hero. Perhaps Melba and
Russell will see that the thing is done pro-
perly, for once.
“0.K.” : When “La Tosca” was produced
as a drama for Sarah Bernhardt she arranged
a long and gruesome laying-out of Scarpia’s
corpse. She spread out the arms, placed six
wax candles about the body, and then put
a rather large crucifix on his chest. Mrs.
Potter did exactly the same business; she
had seen Sarah in Paris. But Lina Scavizzi,
the Tosca of Puccini’s opera, presents an
improved version. Scarpia is lying on his
side, dead. In wrenching the passport from
the closed fingers of an uplifted hand Lina
turns the body so that it lies on its back,
whilst the dead arm falls thwack upon the
floor, outstretched. A thrilling effect. Then
she takes only two of the wax candles from
the supper-table, blowing out tlie other four.
Nervously she puts the candles at the corpse’s
head, before bringing a crucifix to place on
its breast. 1 lorror gets the better of her and
she drops the little crucifix. One is struck
by the operatic artist’s consistency of man-
ner in this scene. She is scared by Scarpia’s
advances, scared by her gory deed —before and
after its accomplishment—and too scared to
bend or kneel down with the crucifix in her
hand. She drops it on her victim’s body.
“Oldtyme": Nellie Mortyne and Arthur
Greenaway, the two most travelled of Austra-
lian mummers, were both appearing in Mel-
bourne last week —“Greeny” at the King’s
with Asche, and Nellie in “The Cabaret
Girl.” The lady was making “her reappear-
ance in Australia” as a Marchioness in the
crazy musical comedy. She must have been
pretty well everything in feminine human
nature, from an empress to a hag, not to
mention a panto, boy, who is only nominally
feminine. Oddly enough these two most-
travelled ones have been equally handicapped
in histrionic life by “foggy” tones. Nellie
Mortyne, only recently back from another
of her periodical absences, gets somewhat
forgotten between times, but she has been
associated with many first productions of
notable plays. She was the aunt of selfish
Horace in “A Message from Mars,” and
a drunk in “Two Little Vagabonds,” long
before she played the respectably unsober
female in “The Faithful Heart.” And how
pleasing was her conversion from grasping
landladyness to motherly benevolence when
she came under the mystic influence of “The
Lodger in the Third Floor Back” ! Every-
body else’s conversion was a bit of a joke,
but the landlady appeared quite a genuine
case of finding grace suddenly.
“Fax” : Italian notions of Scotland in the
“Lucia di Lammermoor” period are less pro-
nouncedly exotic in the Melba-J.C.W. revival
than they were sometimes in the past, but
the kilted men of the chorus are still highly
un-Caledonian in their tartan trappings.
And their unanimously hairless faces sug-
gest that they must be of tenderer age than
they look. A band of beardless adult clans-
men on a heathered moor is a staggerer.
Apropos, is it the right thing for Scots to
wear their hats in a baronial hall when a
marriage contract is being signed? I don’t
know —I merely ask.
“Yarra Ben”: Galsworthy’s “The Skin
Game” is at last to be done in Australia,
Oscar Asche being under contract to pro-
duce it for the Williamson directorate on his'
return to Melbourne a month hence. Oscar,
presumably, will play the pushing and pug-
nacious manufacturer, Hornblower, in which
role Edmund Gwenn, one of the best charac-
ter actors that ever visited this country,
made a hit in London. Asche should fill the
stage all right in the part, but it will be
interesting to see how his methods of pro-
duction suit this most modern and un-
decorative piece.
“V.V.”: Apropos of Howard Vernon’s
production of “The Grand Duchess,” at Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne (B. 27/3/’24). The
Royal Comic Opera Co. had been disbanded
by J. C. Williamson with no prospect of re-
engagement for at least 12 months. Vernon
took the house over, secured a lease of the
theatre at £l2 per week, and, after rehears-
ing u fortnight, produced “The Grand
Duchess.” Twice during the first perform-
ance J.C.W. offered Vernon a good engage-
ment. but he refused. A few days after-
wards J.C.W. met him in Bourke-street
and asked him when he was “going to give
up the mad idea of playing in that barn.”
“The day will come,” said Vernon, propheti-
cally, “when you will be glad to play in that
A STAYER.
“I used to practise so much that I paralysed
two fingers.”
“That’s nothing. My wife practised so much
that she paralysed four neighbors.”
same barn.” At that time the Princess's
was Williamson’s ideal playhouse ; but Vernon
knew that the acoustic properties of Her
Majesty’s were far superior. Any comedian
who has played on both stages knows that
the response from the audience at the
Exhibition-street house is immediate. At
the Princess's, on the other hand, there is
a perceptible pause between the joke and the
response.
From Eardley Turner: —
I agree with “E.F.” (B. 27/3/’24) that Barrie has
never hit it with Australian playgoers; but it is so
long since a full-length piece of his was produced
that the experiment might advantageously be tried
of staging his maturer and stronger work. Such a
play as “Mary Rose” should stand a chance. A new
generation has arisen since “What Every Woman
Knows”-—the last Barrie piece, I believe, to be done
in Australia. Apropos, when Gregan McMahon and
i were engaged to play in this comedy, the late
George Musgrove, under whose direction it was put
up, insisted on reading it to us, as neither was able to
attend the early rehearsals. It is a long piece, the
day was very hot, and the room in which the reading
took place, high up in the old Princess’s Theatre
building, was close and stuffy. It was as much as
my fellow-mummer and I could do to keep
awake. When the recital was at last over G.M.
asked us our opinion. We roused ourselves and
agreed that it was “charming.” “That settles it,”
growled Musgrove, disappointedly. “Whenever I hear
the word ‘charming’ from any of the audience on an
Australian first night I know the ulay is a failure.”
SHE'D PREFER CASH HERSELF.
THE ARTIST: "I’ve been getting a good deal
of credit for my work lately.”
THE M ODEL: “But can you get enough of
it to live on?”
“A.P.”; Discussing Aselie’s comment on
the bad English spoken by many Australians,
the Age remarks that Oscar had the benefit
of hearing Henry Irving, and owes much
to that celebrity’s elocution. This is hard
to swallow, as it was often complained of
Irving that he mouthed his lines “as curs
mouth a bone.” I take it that 11. B. Irving’s
Hamlet was a close copy of his father's, and
I recall the fist H.B. made of one of the
Prince’s soliloquies:—
Fie on’t! ah fie! ’tis an unwee-ee-ded ga-a-rden
That grows to zeed. Things rank and gross in Nadure
Pozzezz it merely. Thad id should come to this!
Bud two munce dead.
Bandmann it may have been—l was vividly
reminded of that old-time mummer. Shaks-
peare it was not.
“Floater”: A 'while back Lawrence Gros-
smith was robbed of goods alleged to be
worth £2OOO, and shortly afterwards his
leading lady, Diana Wilson, was deprived of
jewels said to be undervalued at a thousand.
But the thieves who visited Melba’s flat in
South Yarra decamped merely with £5
worth of booty, the most important articles
being four bottles of liquor. As Melba
probably has with her several cases of tiaras,
not to mention other gauds of great price, the
assumption is that the burglars disdained the
loot in order to prevent her getting addi-
tional limelight. Lionised as they themselves
are by the post-meridian and pony-racing
press, the leaders of our underworld now
refuse to be exploited by mere show people
for sweet advertisement’s sake.
“L.H.P.”: That comic-opera season at
Melbourne Queen’s, in June and July of
1897 (B. 27/3/’24), was under the direc-
tion of Howard Vernon. “Rip Van Winkle”
and “Madame Angot” were played, as well
as “The Grand Duchess,” and Vernon’s Rip
w r as memorable. He had good support in
the Gretchen of Fannie Liddiard and the Kat-
rina of Esther Castles; and other principals
were J. D. Stcyle (billed as Richard
Prince), Fred Young, Frank Gromann and
Charles Beetham, while Alice Mitchell
danced brilliantly. Florence Seymour was
the Mdlle. Lange to Vernon’s Ange Pitou in
Lecocq’s opera, with Miriam Lewis as
Clairette. The chorus was practically from
the Royal Comics, which had temporarily
disbanded.
“Norbell”: Another sequel to “The Mer-
chant of Venice” (B. 20/3/’24) has been
written by Francis Jackson, master of Syd-
ney Grammar School, and president of the
N.S.W. Shakspeare Society. The period,
as in St. John Ervine's continuation, is 10
years after the trial; but Jackson’s effort
was played on April 23, 1923, at the Aus-
tralian Hall, Sydney—lons before the Irish-
man's London outbreak.
“J.F.H.” (Loud.) : The retirement of
Arthur Collins reminds me of the queerest
“Australian drama” I ever saw. “The Duchess
of Coolgardie.” Between the passing of
Augustus Harris and the assumption of con-
trol by Collins, who had been Harris’s under-
study, two or three mushroom managements
were associated with Drury Lane. It was
one of these that put on “The Duchess of
Coolgardie,” a locality then in the boom.
“The Duchess” struck me as a Western
American play adapted to supposed Austra-
lian conditions by some London hack. The
late J. M. Finnerty, then warden at the
Old Camp, was introduced as a character.
There was a scene in which John Michael,
clad in a gorgeous uniform and escorted by
the most amazing lot of Wcstralian police-
men in captivity, quelled a disturbance among
a mob of diggers, got up to resemble tlie
denizens of Bed Dog and Poker Gulch. That
is my only distinct recollection of “The
Duchess” ; but, then, she died young.
“Pindar”: The late George Rignold was
once approached for assistance by a decrepit
person who claimed that he had been keeping
the wolf from the door by writing sketches
and plays. Rignold asked to see some of the
dramatist’s work, promising to give his
opinion of them when sending them back.
The next day came a bundle of MSS. which
Rignold read for some minutes and then
hurriedly returned. Attached to the parcel
was his terse note: “Dear Sir, —I think you
must have read these to the wolf.—Yours
faithfully, George Rignold.”
“O. Gidd”: “Te Pana” (B. 13/3./’24) is
wrong in calling “Djin Djin” Chinese. Its
author sub-titled it “A Fairy-tale of Old
Japan.” When it was first staged in Mel-
bourne, 29 years ago, the cast included John
Coleman (who introduced the Scarecrow
dance), Elton, Arthur Liston (in the name-
part), Florence Young (principal boy).
Carrie Moore and Ivy Scott. Carrie and
Ivy, both youngsters at the time, sang “1
Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard,” one of
the hits of the piece. The panto had a great
run considering the times, and was repeated
a year or two later with one Crackles in
Coleman’s part.
“Maph” (Lond.) : “Zeus,” who suggests
(B. 8/11/’23) that Australia has a mon-
opoly of the grinning performers who line
up behind the footlights after every act.
has evidently not been to London recently.
In my travels about Cockneyville during the
past six months I haven’t seen a comedy or
dramatic co. that omitted the bowing parade
between acts. In “Rossum’s Universal
Robots” whole groups of murdered people
were resuscitated by the limelight. The
leading figure in Henry Arthur Jones’s “The
Goal” dies of angina pectoris, but when the
rag is raised again he obligingly returns to
life. I have even seen a one-acter, with a
spiritualistic theme, in which two deceased
gentlemen took a curtain-call.
“Hamfat”: Kate Rooney—the English
Kate, not the Australian —used to warble a
thing called “The Boy I Love Is Up in the
Gall-er-ie.” It was the song of the season
in London, where the “gods” were almost
delirious in their approval—there is a tra-
dition, probably false, that one kipper-and-
eoekles merchant, in a transport of enthusi-
asm, fell over the rail—but it never made a
hit in Australia, its mushy sentiment failing
to thrill. The Cockney galleryite is easily
moved by appeals to his ’art, and loves to
have it suggested from behind the footlights,
particularly by a be-diamonded female with
a piercing voice and a bounteous bosom,
that the downtrodden do get a look in some-
times. By contrast, the Australian “god”
is a cynical materialist. An old melodrama
contained the line, “Your title, me lud,
does not dazzle her ; she per-fers the pewali
love of an honest working-man.” An actor
who had played the part in London told me
it was the line of the piece there. In Sydney
and Melbourne it never got a “hand.”
“Herodot”: Australian film-producers are
not exempt from the stupid anachronisms
which make so many U.S. pitchers ridiculous.
In a locally-made plioto-play, the scene of
which was laid about the beginning of the
nineteenth century, two of the characters
were armed with revolvers. These weapons
hadn’t been invented then. In another film,
taken in Sydney, the walls of a bedroom were
adorned with metal picture-frames, which
didn’t come in till long after the period with
which the story dealt. Apropos, one spoiler of
good photographic material, who gets his stuff
screened somehow —I suspect that the man-
agement’s object, in some cases, is to show
how silly Australian pictures can be when
the wrong people make them—has a mania
for holding Australian farmers up to ridi-
cule. Having seen a good deal of the men
who have gone on the land in the last 15
years. I can testify that they are much more
intelligent, on the whole, than the oafs who
caricature them in bad pictures.
MIRABILE DIOTU!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I knew a poet once
Who kept for company
A bird that did him stunts
All up the scale to C.
Then suddenly he struck
A thought that (though he died)
Might change his rotten luck ;
So merrily he cried:
“Suppose this bird should get
Mv little song by heart,
I might be famous yet.”
And thus lie made a start;
But clearly failed because —
The people said who heard,
Most cruelly—it was
The song that got the bird!

A Car of Beauty
THE new racy Paige-Jewett Special Six is
equipped with every accessory one could
possibly desire. With the same powerful motor
as in all Paige-Jewetts, the same rigidity of con-
struction but with a beautiful exclusive Jewett
finish and crushed Spanish leather upholstery,
the difference in cost between the Paige-Jewett
Special and the Standard Paige-Jewett is more
than made up by the added accessories—and
what is all important is that it is a Paige-Jewett,
which 30,000 owners, by their purchase during
the first year —have designated to be the best
car of its kind and class made.

Bridge: But did the Circular Quay berth-
ing for ocean ships “have to go” ? Haven’t the objec-
tions to it been taken as a matter of course? There
are some good reasons why a few big boats should
use these berths; if there are really overwhelming
reasons why they should be turned away, those rea-
sons haven’t been mentioned. Certainly there’s some
danger in bringing big ships in there; but there’s
some danger in bringing them into the harbor at all.
....G.H.V., E.B., Philos: Sorry we haven’t the space.
.... Polecat: Only fireworks, and not very eye-filling
either... .C.P.E.; Go through it again and cut out
the superfluous. You wander round the block every
time you want to cross the street.... Phil K.: The
humor of these alleged Babu letters grows threadbare.
....Tricked; First ask the publisher for an account
of sales. But there are so many points involved that
you’d better see a good lawyer about it....Kip: So
dull. . . .C. Vic. Toe: But Smuts (who wants a share
of tlie anti-British Dutch vote) has repudiated Singa-
pore in the name of S. Africa; Canada has never
had a navy worth mentioning, and apparently never
means to while the Monroe doctrine prevails ; India
is in no mood to contribute to an Imperial project,
and Ireland and Newfoundland are so far from the
affected zone that they hardly know there is a Pacific
problem.... Nymus: “Fever” wants some strengthen-
ing food—about a ton should do....Rix: IVt
don’t reprint ; and the thing you send is miles below
standard, anyhow....E.M.E.: Not up... .Cassius:
Terrible.... R.F.K.: “Quest” is nearly good enough.
. . . .2nd Batt.: As poor as a poet when Whidden has
finished with him.... Mombak: That’s the sort of
thing that makes the racecourse really interesting:—
Said the owner of the horse, to the judge of the race,
“You squint-eyed swine, I’ll smack your face;
My horse won that race, you cannot dc>n3%
You say he didn’t, you're telling a lie.
He came from the outside, flashed past the post,
Beating the rest by a length at the most.
You placed him second, just out of spite ;
Put up your props, we’ll have a fight.”
So he sparred around, and landed blows
In his eyes, his mouth, and broke his nose ;
A blow on his chest, the judge let a groan,
For the owner had fractured h-is collarbone.
In fury now, the owner swore, •
And hit the judge blows galore—
One on his ear, and he pitched on his head,
His skull was fractured, and he lay dead.
At the inquest the owner took an oath
That to take the man's life he was very loth;
So the coroner’s jury came to decide
That the deed was justifiable homicide.
....Max W.: They’re well on the road to Point
Acceptance... .H.J.B.; Very crude stuff. .. .Madeline
B.; Doesn’t make much of a yarn.... Twyford: Off
our beat. . . .E.L.W.: Both verse and prose are far
away....R.H. (Windsor): Improved, but still not
good enough.... Una C.: The verses repeat the old
things. .. .C. (Nyngan) : No value. . . .Harry P.: An
unpleasant yarn that doesn’t make us believe it’s
true... .C.W.C.: Left us dozing. .. .A.A.A.: And did
not rouse us... .M.I. (Turramurra) : Doesn’t get past
the mat....S.B. (Chats wood) : We were bruised all
over by the time we had bumped to the end....
P.J.M.: You make extravagant nonsense of it....
R.D.C.: So dry it pulled up at the first pub
Dandelion: The verse is rocky and the ideas are not
worth while.... Adah: No use offering ragged prose
as verse.... Bellerive: “Thrilling Escape” has all
the old intensity:—
Loudly a top window
Of a mansion did crash,
As a reckless burglar
For freedom did dash.
From a verandah he plunged
In he’s desperate flight,
And evaded pursuit in
The darkened night.
A dangerous miscreant;
And he’s daring retreat
Was classed by the police
As a sensational feat.
A daredevil of crime,
In he’s manhood bloom;
The rope or a pistol
Will seal he’s doom.
.... Harry J.: It doesn’t wag its tail vigorously
enough... .H.P.: “Mona Lisa” chatters weakly.
A.T.W.M.: A long way off... .O.W.W.: Common-
place, dressed in sandpaper... .May D.: Nothing in
it. .. .H.E.C.: No use whatever.... Lone H.: “Coin-
cidence” has feeling, but the yarn is an old one
that has been worked to the bone when ideas ran
short.... Lennox W.: Doesn’t strike us....O’D.: The
“Circus” covers old ground.... Dunbar: Too dreary.
....Patrick L.: Good in spots. See if you can’t
make it a bit more convincing. .. .R.R. (Green-
wich) : Blank verse which merely describes a scene
has little chance... .Something G.T.: The office-boy
is too unlikely... .A. M.H.: “Leary” has the makings
of a good yarn, but you’ve dragged it out to weari-
ness....Ted: “The Concert and Dance” has been
better written many times.... 9.2 : Not enough meat
for that amount of gravy.... Harry J.: Material for
a par. Get to it. .. .A.C.A.D.H.: Don’t know where
you could place it. .. .O.M. (Narrabri) : You’ve
carved out your verses with a blunt axe.... James
D.: (l) No reason why your “Ode to Sunset” shouldn’t
be taken up as a regular job and continued for

To Be Dainty
Combat that dingy film on teeth
Wherever you go now you see
glistening teeth. They are teeth you
envy, maybe. Then make this test we
offer. Learn how people get them.
Millions are brushing teeth in a new
way now. They are combating film.
You will be amazed when you see what
that new method means.
Why teeth grow dim
You feel on teeth a viscous film.
Much of it resists the tooth brush,
clings and stays.
Soon that film discolors. Then it
forms dingy coats, and white teeth lose
their lustre.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the
acid in contact with the teeth to cause
decay. It breeds millions of germs,
and they, with tartar, are the chief
cause of pyorrhea.
Protect the Enamel
Pcpsodcnt disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent
far softer than enamel. Never
use a film combatant which
contains harsh grit.

Now a better way
Dental science, after long research,
has found effective ways to fight film.
One acts to disintegrate the film at all
stages of formation. The other re-
moves it without harmful scouring.
A new-type tooth paste has been
created to apply those methods daily.
The name is Pepsodent. Now leadirtg
dentists the world over advise it, and
careful people of some 50 nations use
it every day.
New protection
Pepsodent also multiplies the alka-
linity of the saliva. It multiplies the
starch digestant in saliva. Those are
there to fight acids and starch deposits.
Pepsodent, with every use, gives them
manifold effect.

“Billy See” : Thousands of softwood logs
are imported into W.A. from Borneo and the
Pacific Islands, and most of them are riddled
by a tiny white grub which, in many cases,
is still alive on arrival. Westralia has the
stickfast ilea ravaging its poultry-yards: the
rinderpest happened along yesterday, and the
State is now just about due for some timber
pest which will reduce the value of her
forests 50 per cent.
“Robert”: Some of these so-called art
unions invite criticism. The N.S.W. police
promote one periodically, and it is fairly
obvious that persons running (say) hotels may
feel compelled by other than philanthropic
motives to buy tickets in liberal quanti-
ties from the local John Hop. Every fl
worth of tickets sold means 2s. to the seller,
and the publican with a shaky record could
hardly resist an invitation to buy a book.
The N.S.W. Fire Brigades people also run
an art union, but possibly because the fire-
men have not such an extensive clientele
as the police the com. in their case is 4s.
for selling ft worth of tickets.
“Billy See”: The first iron foundry in
Ballarat was the once-famous Union: John
Hickman, owner and manager. Steam
engines being at first unobtainable, all work
was done by hand. The blower for the
foundry cupola was agitated by a greenhide
belt running on a big dray wheel. On cast-
ing days soldiers of the old 40tli Regiment
were invited to come along and take a turn
at the handle. A bucket of beer on the job
and a two-shilling piece at the knock-off was
the remuneration, and there was never any
shortage of casual labor.
* * * -.
“E.W.M.”: James Tyson was once
attracted by the possibilities of sugar. About
the time cane-growing started at Ij nisfail
(N.Q.), Jimmy purchased 20,000 acres from
the Government with the intention of start-
ing a big venture on the Tully River. But
the further lie went the less he found he
knew about it, so the enterprise ended before
it began. Most of this land fell into the
hands of the Henry family, who parted with
some large blocks to the Tully River Syndi-
cate about 16 years ago. This land Has re-
cently been subdivided and placed on the
market, and a sugar-mill is now being erected
in the locality.
“O.K. : They talk in Melbourne of a co-
operative system whereby the Farmers’
Union will commend itself to town-bred
sympathies by supplying the metropolitan
area with cheaper meat. Being but a very
limited consumer myself I should like the
meat to become tenderer before it is cheaper.
I want not more meat to chew, at a lower
Price, but more to digest and get benefit from.
The meat butchers sell in Melbourne is mostly
tough and tasteless. It must be ill-fed or
ill-slaughtered, ill-frozen or ill-thawed. To
any Melbourne butcher who likened his steak
to a woman’s heart for tenderness, any Harry
Lauder would be justified in asking for
sausages instead. Co-operation for improving
the quality of mutton and beef on sale is a
crying public need. And the lamb! It
was never young. It was born old. It
suggests a deep conspiracy to cure mankind
of the meat habit. It is an insult to fresh
green peas, and a satirical accompaniment to
mmt-sauce.

“Azac”: “S. Ryder” (B. 13/3/’24) is per-
It o iat ie avera B' e yield of maize in
N.S.W. is only about 25 bushels per acre,
when as much as 230 bushels per acre has
been grown on experimental plots in IT.S.A
But yields obtained on tiny areas of picked
land, cultivated and manured regardless of
expense, may be disregarded. The average
yield of maize in IT.S.A. is only about 29
bushels per acre, whereas for the whole of
Australia a lot of maize is grown on very
poor land in South Aus.—the average has
been just on 26 bushels for the last 10 years.
Canada leads the world, with about 50
bushels, with Egypt a good second, so that
A. S. Wales is not so badly placed. To
attribute low yields to want of attention in
seed selection is absurd; the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture has made more experi-
ments with maize than with any other crop
and effectively determined the best varieties
tor every maize-growing district in the State.
When comparing the production of different
countries, whether it be of maize, wheat of
anything else, about the most misleading
way , ls . ° n tlie basis of yields per acre. A
much fairer comparison is obtained on the
basis of production per individual employed
in the industry. ,y
HARVEST THANKSGIVING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In his high church upon the hill.
His pulpit framed in yellow wheat,
The Reverend Saintly treads his mill
Of precept old and prayer until
• Tlie deacon dozes in his seat.
Great grapes in bunches hang on high,
Bright flowers adorn the window cord,
Fat pumpkins in profusion lie;
And choir girls catch the gladsome eye
What time the good man thanks the Lord.
On Plenty Farm along the creek
Old Hayseed’s reached a cocky’s bliss,
Paid off the men without a squeak—
Their arbitrated quid a week
Was nothing with a yield like this.
On motor ads. his optics gloat
(The season ought to stand a Ford) ;
He reads a book a bank clerk wrote ;
While petrol visions round him float,
He sends ten bob to square the Lord.
In Hogan’s bar across the flat
Bill Jackson’s doing in a cheque—
The price of what he labored at
To make old Hayseed’s bank-roll fat
And get himself filled to the neck.
The cookies’ wives who pass and sneer,
The saints by whom Bill is deplored,
Rejoice when harvest crowns the year
That Bill turns up from far or near....
Bill sinks ’em —and forgets the Lord.

Model X Touring Cars
The prospective car purchaser who investigates the capa-
bilities of the Case Model X will find that quality has
been behind this product from its inception. Fourteen
years ago the first Case motor car began with its owner
to prove a right to share in the confidence of motorists.
Since that time many progressive changes and refine-
ments have been made that Case ownership might always
convey transportation of unexcelled comfort and conveni-
ence at low cost with unfailing dependability. The uphold-
ing of that high standard of quality has never been sacrificed
to quantity of production. Case owners to-day pay enthusi-
astic tribute to the complete provisions for motoring satisfac-
tion made in the design and construction of the new models.
With a six cylinder engine that combines flexibility for care-
ful going and fleetness for the open highway —the question of
power is satisfactorily solved. There is no critical speed vibra-
tion to impair its efficiency—acceleration from five to twenty
miles per hour is but one possibility. Fifty-five horse power
is economically delivered smoothly and without labouring.
Low and symmetrical bodies sturdily built ensure a standard
of stability which is unequalled. Because of the lowered
centre of gravity and unique suspension the Case clings to l
the road at all speeds around abrupt curves and on side
grades. A ride in the Case Model X will reveal its many out-
standing advantages.—Arrange for an early demonstration.
The Case Built
iMultiple
Clutch
is a feature of particular inter-
est to motorists. It is at least
30% oversize compared with
the average unit used in cars
of equal power and weight.
Smooth yet positive applica-
tion of power is easily effected.
Gears may be shifted noise-
lessly and without disturbing
jerks. The pedal may be read-
ily adjusted as to length to
suit the driver's convenience.
Disengagement requires but
slight depression thereby in-
creasing the possibilities for
easy manipulation in crowded
traffic. Adjustment for wear is
simple and may be attended to
by anyone without difficulty.

“Sucre”: A certain amount of breezy
originality is recognised as giving additional
value to modern advertising, but when the
local grocer at Paw Paw (N.Q.) attended
a funeral carrying a large open umbrella
with the sign, “Try my ground coffee,
painted on it in white letters, the neighbors
thought he was running the thing to earth.
“Te Paua”: Some print-sellers in Sydney
have adopted the dodge of glueing the repro-
ductions of great paintings on canvas,
varnishing the surface and framing them
without glass. It gives the pictures, mostly
cut from American magazines, the appear-
ance of being “original." In a sense they
are. But some mug is going to fall in some
day. Or perhaps a mug falls in every day.
The last week in March saw something
like a quarter of a million tons of shipping in
the Derwent. Among contributors to the
total were the Hood (41,000 tons), the
Maloja (21,000) and the Ceramic (18,000),
The Hood, like the Mooltan the other
day, berthed alongside Ocean Pier with-
out assistance —precisely as a North Shore
ferry-boat pulls up alongside her jetty at
Circular Quay. There are practically no
tugboats in the Derwent.
A well-known Sydney firm of architects
advertised the other day for a draughtsman.
This came by first post from a country
town :
In reply to your advertisement tor a draughtsman,
I am applying for the position. 1 am 18J years
of age and can drive a horse anywhere. I have had
four years driving draught horses, and feel confident
that I will be able to fill the position to your entire
satisfaction. Trusting to be favored with a prompt
reply, informing me when I may start my duties,
I am
“liinklater" : Who said the Australian abo.
has no business gifts? Squatters and bush
folk of the Cairns (Q.) hinterland coming
into Mareeba always bring a couple of their
black retainers, and at times, especially dur-
ing carnival and Christmas wrecks, they have
experienced difficulty in securing accommoda-
tion for the natives. Now Kruger and .Mag-
gie. a couple of local abos., have opened a
“select boarding establishment"’ at the lower
end of the town —tariff, £1 a week ; washing
extra.
“Sturt”: The suburban estate left by
Peter Waite to Adelaide Uni. over a year
ago is a difficult proposition to handle, and
at a recent meeting of graduates a pointed
question was asked as to the intentions of
the governing body. Chief Justice Murray,
the Chancellor, authorised a statement that
it is intended to establish an “investigation
station,” to be called the Waite Agricultural
Institute, but it has not yet been settled
whether the director should be a farmer
with a touch of science or a scientist with
a touch of agronomy. A special report on
this knotty point from Vice-Chancellor Mit-
chell, now visiting Europe, is expected at
any moment.
“R.G.N.C.” : Not only in Sydney are sites
with age-old horsey associations being trans-
formed into quarters for Dobbin’s successor.
After standing idle for years the large area
of Tattersall’s Horse Bazaar in Exhibitiou-
street, Melbourne, as famous in its day as
Kirk’s in Bourke-street, has been converted
into a modern garage and swanky motor
showrooms. To the original Tattersall’s has
been added a frontage which occupies almost
a complete city block. On this a three-
storeyed pile has been erected. Inclined
ramps permit cars to travel upstairs from
the street on their own power. At an early
trial of the ramp a ear nearly backpedalled
over the guard-rail into the floor below—the
disgusted ghost of some long-dead galloper
at work, no doubt.
Up to March 18 the Speck’s apple ship-
ments to the Cold Country for this season
were 253,565 eases, about half the total
sent afloat at even date last season. Ten
deep-sea ships, including the Mooltan, have
each taken a passing bite at the pippin stack
on Hobart wharf, and there are 14 steamers
listed to tie up at the Ocean Pier for apples
during the next six weeks. Six of these
will lift an average of 50,000 cases apiece,
so that shipments for the season will soon
have reached well over half-a-million
cases. For the whole season the ship-
ments will probably reach 750,000 cases,
as against last year’s tally of 1,500,000 cases
from Tasmania out of the total Australian
export of 2,250.000 cases. Owing to the
“half-crop" conditions prevailing over most
mainland orchards, except in South Aus., the
total Australian export of apples this year
is unlikely to exceed the million and a half
cases shipped last year from the Derwent
and Tamar alone. But better prices are
exnected in London, and it is quite possible
that the aggregate return to growers (or
middlemen) will be greater than last year’s.
“7P.N.” finds tricks in a new trade:—
Since the squatters became prepared to pay fancy
prices for dingo scalps, almost any sort of tripe-
hound is worth a fiver in any of the back country
towns of Queensland, especially if it has a few red
hairs sprinkled about its coat. The trade in scalps
appears ter be the preserve of the kangaroo-shooters,
and a fairly close ring exists. A few privileged
boundary riders and others have, however, been
admitted to the mystic circle. By applying at the
right source, they may now have dingo scalps posted
to them disguised as haberdashery. An amazing
feature of the trade is a small phial of liquid con-
tained in each parcel. A few drops of this added to
some water and applied to the dry pelt will convert
it into an excellent imitation of a “green” skin,
which is handed in to the overseer next morning,
and the bonus collected. The source of the dingo
supply isn’t clearly known, but it is suspected to be
out on the remote basalt tablelands of the north-
dingoes rove in packs in that No Man’s Land. Quite
recently an old wire-whiskered chap in a dishevelled
spring-cart was halted on one of the remote byways
far to the south-west of Winton. He had about a
dozen live dingoes about his person, the timid or
more savage ones in crates, and about four gentle-
dispositioned ones trotting behind the cart at the
ends of dog-chains attached to the axle. He had got
into the trade as a “go-between.” The dinkurn
trappers were operating in the rough dingo infested
ranges on the back of Vergemont, out off the lower
Thompson, «md were fulfilling orders from the sheep
country about Kynuna over 100 miles away. Rewards
and bonuses had climbed to about £lO per dog
among the sheepmen of that district, and the busi-
ness was too good to allow the mere problem of
dog-supplies to interfere with the demand. Of
course, old Wire Whiskers was put on the mat by
the proper authorities and asked what he meant.
Still, nothing could be done from the point of view
of the law, as we haven’t yet arrived at the stage
of prohibiting a man being a bit of a dog-fancier.

ECONOMY was my first consideration
—I saved in wages and costs and real-

SAFETY. —Workers were relieved of
heavy trucking and stowing in every sec-
tion of the works, thereby minimising the
possibility of accident.
EFFICIENCY.—I was able to employ
more hands upon production work. This
QUICKER, EASIER HANDLING
enabled the output to be greatly in-
creased. The work was handled more

“My Motto Is
Rexona.”
■Miss Dorothy Brunton.
Girls! Imagine Your Complexion
Clear, Rosy and Velvety.
Are you sometimes discouraged and feel that your skin is
unattractive, ins ead of being clear, fresh and smooth. It so, look
to the Soap you are using.
Many soaps are more injurious to the skin than actual neglect, for
they contain harmful alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy
its delicate texture.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a specially-prepared skin soap,
entirely free from harmful alkali. It will do more to improve your
skin than you ever thought a soap could do, for it is medicated on the
same principle as the famous Rexona Ointment. Thus it is able to
exert the hygienic effects of Rexona upon the skin with every cleansing
operation.
Simply use Rexona Soap once or
twice a day, and see if it does not
relieve the clogged pores, reduce
the tendency to blotches, redness
and oiliness and leave the com-
plexion clear, rosy and velvety.

The Hollow Tree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f INHERE was once a hollow tree
In a woodland olden,
“*■ Gnarled and twisted wondrously,
Strung with leaves all golden.
Through the woods the sunbeams crept
In the summer weather,
While the blackbird whistled shrill
From the budded heather.
There were pools beside the track
And a streamlet singing.
Where, in dewy sweetness bent,
Feather-ferns were clinging.
When we found the hollow free
On a sunny morning,
Soft, with finger pressed on lip
And a whispered warning.
We crept up and, warily.
Looked within the hollow tree,
With its grey trunk twisted.
Knowing all undoubtingly
Here the fairies trysted.
There, caught in a spider’s web,
In the sunlight glistening.
Hung a tiny, silver wing.
Long we lingered, listening.
When the night was still and clear,
Lit with white stars quivering.
Through the wooded path we stole',
Bare of foot and shivering.
Ghostly stood the hollow tree
In fantastic shadows
As the hour of midnight chimed
From beyond the meadows;
And the pale, mis-shapen moon
Peeped with eerie glances,
Pointing to the twisted tree
With her long, white lances.
Then from out its hollow dark
Streamed the elfin legions.
Breathlessly we watched them wing
From the secret regions—
Little, light elusive things.
Small and sweet and wary.
Fluttering on their frail white wings
From the realm of faery.
Silently we saw them fly—
We the guests unbidden —
Down among the rain-wet grass
Shiveringly hidden.
Through the mass of fern and brake
Delicately dancing—•
Ah, we scarcely dared to gaze
At the sight entrancing!
Then the great owl soundlessly
Down the track came sweeping,
Where from out the black tree-boles
Timid mice w r ere peeping.
Down into the hollow r tree
Streamed the fairy legions,
Hasting, as the stars grew pale.
Back to unknown regions.
And across the meadows went,
Sorrowful and lonely.
Two who of the hollow tree
Knew the entrance only.
On this sunny April day
In the old wood wandering,
There I saw the hollow tree,
Long since fallen helplessly.
And I lingered, pondering....
Was it twenty years ago—
How indeed time passes!
Since we lay in ecstasy
Down among the grasses,
Watched the silver moon-moths flit
White among the shadows;
And went homeward in the dawn
Through the misty meadows?
Ah, me! I would be again
Nine—or slightly under—
All the world a hollow tree,
All paths ways of wonder.
I would find each moth a fay;
And in every flower.
Hidden somewhere in the heart.
A green elf in bis bower.

Twin-Bed Dialogues.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
I.—THE TIN HONEYMOON.
BABETTE and I looked at each other
in consternation.
“It’s a double bed!” she gasped.
Yes. there was no doubt about it. There
it stood, in all its stodginess, a four-poster
in the middle of the room, fatly beaming at
ns. And it was quite six years since we had
slept in a double bed. Babette. my delight-
ful wife, always said that, though a double
bed had its uses on a honeymoon, it was
too ugly and prosaic for married life. It
seemed to take all the romance out of matri-
mony. where, she sighed, romance was most
needed.
Perhaps it would be as well to mention
oetore you refuse to read further that
l*abette and I had now been married 10
years. Ten long years, though all married
years are long, even with a Babette to
brighten them. And we had two children,
l>abettekins and Penelope.
Now, in order to celebrate the awful fact
hat we had been married 10 years, Babette
iaa courageously insisted on the due observ-
ance ot our tin honeymoon. I left her
to choose the place. With a sentimen-
mT i ICI ? '‘-id thought had long been
Knocked out of her owing to too much baby,
>apette chose the seaside boarding-house in

tlle look ln the eye of the maid and
the clerk at the booking-office I will be set
down as an elderly roue week-ending with
his favorite typist.”
“Ooh ! Wouldn’t that be lovely if it
were!” crooned Babette with a look that
slipped past me into space. I have no
doubt that in that instant there material-
ised in Babette’s vivid mind a vision of a
big, bull-necked captain of industry, whose
intentions were strictly dishonorable, and
whose bank account would withstand any
drain. Instead of that, here she was with
a mere husband. She came back to earth
with a sigh. You can’t have it both ways;
she remembered that she was merely a de-
voted wdfe.
“But don't you see what they’ve done?”
she insisted. “They’ve given us the bridal
chamber!”
It looked horribly like a bridal chamber.
The pink-flowered wall-paper, the daintiness
of the furniture, yet sturdy enough to stand
the weight of somebody on somebody’s knee,
the proprietory aspect of the double bed, the
virginal whiteness of the appointments dis-
mayed us. Two well-married persons re-
turning to celebrate the obsequies of their
hot youth, autumnal ghosts of a distant
Spring!
Babette kissed me ruefully. It was one
of her habitual married kisses.
Methodically she set to work to unpack.
I watched her with a sombre gaze. It was
so long since I had felt any interest or
excitement over the display of Babette’s
crepe de Chine and voile. Nor did Babette,
show any confusion at my careless scrutiny.
Even the most intimate articles of attire
become mere clothes after you have viewed
them and their successors for 10 years. As
well expect Babette to blush shyly at my
pyjamas. She even showed me proudly but
aloofly her new nightie, which was just like
her other nighties, but less so, holding it out
blatantly in front of her figure. Even a hus-
band knows that is no way to judge a nightie.
We fled from that menacing room and its
horrible implications, and wandered down to
the beach. Here we were a married pair,
revisiting the pale glimpses of our honey-
moon, and striving to recapture the first fine
careless rapture of our youth. It was ray
paramount duty to keep up a noble pretence
of youthful happiness. Then Babette was
a country quite unexplored. Now* I knew
every inch of it. Yet for the dear girl’s
sake I had to pretend to be her jealous
and ardent lover. Poor girl, she was thrill-
ing all over with the delight of this senti-
mental journey.
We sat by the sea, silently contemplating
the waves. As waves they were all right,
but even waves grow tiresome after half-an-
hour’s contemplation in silence. And though
I honestly tried to converse upon the sub-
ject of the ocean, I merely found myself re-
peating all the original things I had said
upon waves during our real honeymoon. Be-
sides. Babette had heard them all before.
And when you’ve got a pipe properly going
there is little reason to spoil your smoke by
chatter.
She was lost in her reveries. I knew that
she was remembering liow r we too simple
idiots had sat there during the intervals
between the strenuous passages of our honey-
moon.
We strolled back for lunch. When we
entered the bridal chamber Babette deftly
locked the door and lifted her lips to mine.
I kissed her as iu duty bound, and she sighed
a deep content. Memories were reviving—
wonderful how these women can pretend!
After lunch, at which there were ample
evidences of Babette’s appetite, we wandered
about the garden, revisiting all the shady
corners where we had kissed. I was sur-
prised to discover how commonplace those
spots were. In my memories the flowers
had been more glorious, the grass more green,
the sunlight brighter, the shadows more con-
cealing. the kisses more exciting. It was
really a poor and shabby garden, singularl’
destitute of romance. It seemed to me iik
a faded photograph of a beauty spot.
Then we went for a bathe in the ocean.
Babette had brought her newest and smart-
est bathing-dress. And really she looked
amazingly provocative in it. I do not mean
to say that she was the sea-nymph of the
early days of my acquaintance with her.
Her figure was still a Babette figure, but
it was no longer the slim and willowy figure
that I married. Those were the days of
waists; and there were occasions when I
was almost afraid she might snap in two.
She still retains that w r aist, but waists—com-
fortable things they were, too —have gone
out of fashion. She was 10 years older;
and from the slim maid she had developed
into —no, not and never the matron —but
the woman. There was a little more of
Babette than I had promised to love and
cherish; but it was merely a gentle and
graceful rounding of contours. In her bath-
ing-suit she hid —well, hardly hid —the finest
figure on the beach, and being an intelli-
gent and observing woman she knew it.
Perhaps you may think I was prejudiced.
But there was plenty of corroborative evi-
dence. There were many young men in the
surf, bronzed athletes, whom I caught look-
ing at Babette in,a way that I strongly dis-
approved of. There was one man whom I
thought almost rude, so obvious was his
admiration. I felt moved to remind him of
his rudeness, but the development of biceps
deterred me. A further deterrent, however,
was Babette. I felt quite sure that she
revelled in his admiring gaze. And I saw
her deliberately flattening her stomach when
he looked at her. That is an infallible sign
that a woman in a bathing-dress is sitting
up and taking notice.
Babette was fond of surfing. The athletic
brute was an expert surfer, too. There was
no need, it seemed to me, why Babette and
this strange young man should so often
choose the same breaker to come shooting in
on to the beach. Resignedly I said I would
wait on the. sands for her. She certainly
kept me waiting. She was evidently enjoy-
ing herself. Tired at last, I let my gaze
stray, and met the dark blue eyes of a nubbly
young girl in a bright green bathing-suit.
She was un-companion ed, but I could not
understand why. I seemed to remember her
figure. It flashed upon me that it was the
figure of Babette—lo years ago. There was
a lissom slenderness about her—a Some-
thing. ...
I regret to say it, but I could not help
thinking that she looked more attractive than
Babette. And then the reason flashed upon...

cut my ankle on a piece of concealed
coral. Soon the sore began to give
me great pain and swelled to an
alarming size, so that I had to lay
up as soon as I got back to Rabaul.
I thought that I would doubtless lose
rny foot, and, the doctors failing to
relieve me, I was obliged to tender
my resignation to the Administra-
tion, and try to treat the ghastly
sore myself, in the hope of saving my
limb.
“I tried all kinds of things with-
out result, and was getting recon-
ciled to the idea of having my foot
taken off,when! happened to be in the
store in the township, and obtained
a box of Zam-Buk. After two or
three applications of a generous
amount of your ointment I tounu
that the angry look seemed to get a
healthier color, the discharge grew
less, and I was so overjoyed at t.ie
improvement that I returned to the
store and bought the whole ot their
stock. Using Zam-Buk more often,
and in liberal doses, I persevered
with the treatment until the im-
provement became more and more
apparent, and, though slow, the cure
was certain.
“I truthfully believe that Zam-
Buk saved me from being a cripple
for the rest of my life, and 1 can
only half express my gratitude to its
curative powers, and shall certainly
recommend it to others. ’

THE HEALER THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS
me. It Avas another Babette I Avas gazing
at. Apparently there are other Babettes in
the world. Ten years ago Babette had just
this young girl's figure, legs and all. I was
looking down the long years at the Babette
I had married!
When she luxuriously stretched herself on
the warm sand and looked appealingly at me
Avith the unspoken remark, "Here I am all
on my lone Avitli nobody to talk to. I am
quite approachable, and if you Avan t to
have a chat about the weather why shouldn’t
you and I console each other now that no-
body’s looking?” what could I do but, in
the language of eyes, mutely agree?
After all, Avhat harm Avas there in it? 1
squirmed a little nearer. Luckily she did
not notice my unworthy move. Hoav did
one begin? I deeply regretted that I had
got out of practice.
“Oh, there you are!” said Babette, looking
down on me—and on her—Avith radiant
eyes. “I'm so sorry, dear, I kept you waiting
(So long, but the surf was glorious!” she
remarked. The curious thing was that
Babette never even noticed the slim and in-
viting figure by my side.
I jumped up and dutifully enveloped
Babette in her smart striped bathing robe;
and we left the beach, a happily married pair.
“By the Avay,” she remarked, "did you sec
that girl in the bright green bathing suit?
No, I suppose you wouldn’t, you dull old
dear. Rather nice figure, for a youngster,”
she went serenely on; “she is about half
your age. She’ll get fat. of course. That
too-obyous figure always does.”
Babette had got in first. She always does.
And I suddenly remembered my just griev-
ance. Here Avas I on my deferred honey-
moon, and Babette had deserted me to bathe
with a stranger! It hurt.
“I wonder, dear, if you noticed a man
Avho was in the surf Avith me?” she inno-
cently asked. “Not a had build and rather
a nice smile. Magnificent shoulders on
him! I liked his legs. So male! But, as I
was a married woman I av:i.n merely polite.
You never know what people are that in-
troduce themselves to you on the top of a
breaker.” She sighed again. “All the same,
it is rather hard, sometimes, to remember that
you’re a married woman Avitli a husband
that’s rather nice.”
That’s Babette. Never penitent. Some-
times I think she is only five years old. But
a very precious child.
I should have chided her, but I felt curi-
ously warmed all over by the look that Miss
Bright Green had given me.
We had a pleasant dinner on the balcony
of the hotel. Babette Avas radiant. The
bathe seemed to have made her a girl again.
She insisted on wine, the sparkling kind.
And she played up for my benefit like a kid
just out of school. At times T almost thought
she was acting before an audience; and when
over our glasses she pledged me good luck
she was such an actress that her glance
seemed to pass over me as if to an audi-
torium.
It was only when at last we rose that I
noticed a spruce, bronzed young man sitting
at the table exactly behind me. It Avas the
young man Babette had been introduced to
by the Pacific Ocean. Luckily Babette did
not notice him as we passed. Doubtless she
would not have recognised him with so many
clothes on.
We had our coffee and liqueurs at a little
table in the garden. Already the garden was
identifying itself with the garden of my
honeymoon memories.
The night was still, and filled with vague
Avhispers. Couples strolled past us into the
shadows; and from an alcove came loav mur-
murs that sent our thoughts back 10 years.
We had occupied that alcove; wc had made
those delicious murmurs; Babette had sat on
my knee and doubtless the girl in the
shadow sat now on somebody's knee.
Suddenly from the shadows came a sharp
Avhisper, a gurgle, a pretended struggle and
a calculated gasp. Babette’s fingers stole
into mine. She was thrilled.
“Ten years ago!” she romantically avMs-
pered. “Still, you’re a dear old thing, and
we’re thoroughly happy in a settled-down
Avay. Only, I wish” ——
I wished, too. But this crude struggle had
driven away the tingling romance. The gold
of the honeymoon had turned into tin.
"Poor things!” Babette murmured. “It
begins like that, but then with babies and
income-taxes it ends like this. They don’t
knoAv —lucky for them ! But you’re a dear
old thing!”
More murmurs; more kisses; more hugs.
Babette was living our honeymoon over
again. I leaned over and kissed her; but
I am not sure that it was me she so rap-
turously kissed back. A dreadful thought
flashed into my mind that she Avas taking-
advantage of the darkness to kiss the young
man of the surf by proxy.
The collide sheepishly emerged from the
alcove. The young man was Babette’s
young man : the girl was my bright green girl.
“Beasts!” muttered Babette. "Horrible,
isn’t it?”
I agreed.
“Well,” she said with a weary sigh, “it’s
time Ave went to bed. Surfing does make you
sleepy, doesn’t it:?”
1 took her up to the door of the belated
bridal chamber.
“Don’t be long finishing your cigar, dear,”
she said.
And Avhen I gently entered the room
Babette was lying on the extreme edge of
that dreadful double bed. It looked so obvi-
ously lioneymoony. that grim four-poster!
And when I crept into its enormous expanse
Babette never moved. She Avas not pretend-
ing ; she Avas sound asleep. Poor kid! Tired
out! She must have forgotten all about our
honeymoon.
I moved to the extreme edge of my side of
the double bed. The sharp sword of custom
and commonplace lay between us. Ten years
had elapsed... .
Next morning Babette developed home-
sickness. She suddenly, clamantly wanted
her kiddies. We caught the early train.
Babette was quite sentimental about leaving
the hotel of memories. I wasn’t. Hotel
accommodation charges had increased during
the intervening 10 years. Babette cheered
up a little when she found that the young
brute she had mot in the surf was going to
the town by the same train. So was the
girl whose back I had admired on the beach.
In the motor-bus that took us to the station,
Babette, as she afterwards explained, simply
had to acknowledge the presence of her
acquaintance of the surf. He introduced the
bright green girl to us both. In her clothes the
resemblance to the Babette that had grown
up Avas absurdly close. I found myself say-
ing things to her that with perfect propriety
I used to say to Babette. The younger
edition of Babette seemed to like them.
Babette herself did not seem to mind; she
was too busy.
When the train arrived there was only one
empty compartment. There was nothing for
us to do but to share it. It was olmous
that the young man and the girl would
rather have had the compartment to them-
selves. So would Babette and I—though I
am not so sure about Babette. All we could
do Avas to sit opposite the other pair and
make polite conversation.
Babette had a bright inspiration. “Isn’t
there a tunnel on this trip?” she innocently
asked me. Everybody brightened - when I
admitted there Avas. And four pairs of eyes
looked up at the place where the light should
have been and noticed that the gas had not
been lit.
“Neyer mind,” said Babette sAveetly. “It’s
not a long tunnel.”
Three persons sighed.
The train slid into the tunnel; and then
there was a bump. Something on the line,
perhaps. Anyhow, it threw us all over the
place in the darkness; but as the train went
steadily on we picked ourselves up, laughing
and unhurt, and sorted ourselves out.
Babette’s Avarm lips sought mine in a kiss
that seemed more avid and clinging than I
had had from her since—oh, well, since our
first honeymoon, for Babette was experi-
enced even then. The dear, dear thing!
She Avas living her honeymoon all over
again !
1 returned it with a lover’s delight : and
Avhen I pressed Babette closer to me 1 Avas
surprised by the illusion of her slimness.
And then it dawned on me. It Avasn't
Babette. It was something better than
Babette. What a chance I had nearly
missed!
I do not know how I escaped from this
green girl’s embrace, but 1 managed to re-
sume my seat before the light came in by
the windows. We had emerged from the
tunnel of romance into the drab light of day.
What made the experience more thrilling
was the consciousness that the bright green
girl Avasn’t even married. Where do these
flappers get the practice?
I looked swiftly around. Babette, the de-
mure, Avas quietly seated by my side. I
thanked goodness that she had no suspicion
of the amazing incident. I looked at the
girl. She regarded me with an aloof and
dreamy gaze.
We parted at the station, with some reluc-
tance. The play was over; the curtain had
fallen.
“It’s been a perfectly delightful honey-
moon,” cooed Babette Avhen we got home to
the kiddies; and looking at her radiant
happiness I agreed. Especially the incident
of the tunnel of romance.
The next day I naturally came home
earlier than my wont. I let myself in. I
Avas hanging up my coat when I heard
Babette’s voice at the telephone. I could not
help hearing the first few remarks; and
though I could have helped, and should have
helped, hearing the rest, I didn’t. After Id
years’ marriage we had no secrets from each
other. At least, Babette hadn’t. So what
harm was there?
“Yes.” came her voice. “I had a rotten
time, dear. Bored to tears all the time.
Poor .Tames was quite a success on his first
honeymoon—at least, his first with me : but.
well, my dear. I like my coffee hot, not iced.
Still. I didn’t give myself away, for his sake,
It was simply pathetic to sec how he revelled
in those old stale memories of 10 years ago.
He really believed that he was living those
thrills over again—as if they ever can be!
... .Yes. dreadfully disappointing. _ though
knowing James as well as I do, I didn’t ex-
pect much. I don’t like those warmed-up
dinners. Still, I’m glad the poor dear chap
didn’t suspect that 1 wasn't enjoying it....
Oli! I knew you’d ask me that, you mean
thing!. .. .Nooooo ! Nothing doing !.... Oh.
yes, there was one nice boy 1 met in the
surf. . . .All right! Of course, 1 smiled first.
These modern young men are so shy....
I'm! He liked me, all right, quite keen.
Made me feel 10 years younger lames?
Oh, he was waiting on the beach... .Y'es, of
course! Gave me his telephone number, the
office one, you know.... Might, or might
not, my dear. Oh, but the most exciting
thing happened on the way home, in the
tunnel, you know —oh. I must ring off !
.lames has just come in. Toll you more in
the morning. Yes. it was a most enjoyable
trip. Loved every minute or it — so did
James.”
“Well, Babette.” I cheerily said as she
ran to meet me in the ball: “how did you
like it?”
“Just tolling Edna how perfectly delight-
ful it was,” she happily replied. "But do
you know what I loved best? That kiss
you gave me in the tunnel! There was
something about that kiss in the dark that
brought me back to 10 years ago. I had
really forgotten that you could kiss like that."
Now, 1 wonder how much my wife knew,
or how much she knew T knew. That's the
worst of Babette. You never really know.
And yet that’s the best of Babette. She
keeps even her husband guessing.
We went early to bed. Babette sighed
that she was yearning for her own twin
bed after that double bed at the hotel. And
I kissed her a married good-niglit and coin-
posed myself in my own twin bed, on the
other side of the room. But not even the
delicious comfort of a bed to myself could
make me go to sleep. I lay there in my soli-
tude, pondering over the perennial problem
of a wife who loved me and yet could see
something attractive in every presentable
other man who came along. Then across the
still room came a little sigh. Poor girl, per-
haps she was sorry?
Stealthily I rose in the darkness and steL
across to Babette's lonely bed. In the
middle of the room I ran into something
soft and warm. I put my arms around it.
It certainly wasn’t a burglar.
“I xvas just coming to say good-night to
you,” I whispered.
“I was just coming to you!”
After all. our tin honeymoon wasn’t en-
tirely a failure.
