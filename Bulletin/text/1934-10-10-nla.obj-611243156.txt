Come and see
Matches being made
IF you visit Melbourne for the Centenary Celebrations or
Royal Show, enjoy a fascinating morning (or after-
noon) . in Bryant & May’s Model Factory, where
millions of matches are made daily—there are few sights
more interesting than the manufacture of these matches.
Come and see the peeling machines that veneer thousands
of feet of Queensland logs. Come and marvel at the giant
machines that, with wonderful efficiency, handle millions
of matches in a series of operations, from dipping the
wooden splints to packing the finished matches in their
boxes. See the taper for Wax Vestas being woyen at the
rate of 60 miles an hour, and many other interesting
operations.
Melbourne Show Week gives visitors an opportunity for
visiting us, although we would remind you that we have
the “Welcome” sign out all the year round, to city and
country visitors alike. Come then on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday or Thursday of Show Week at 9.30 a.m. or
2 p.m. No invitation —other than this—is needed.

BOOKS
The Week’s Best: —
A CAPITAL
TALE-SPINNER
Using a pseudo-
nym which com-
pounds Israel and
Ireland, Isak
Dinesen, said to
be a Dane, has
loomed up in the United States, writing,
in English, tales set in Denmark, Ger-
many, France, Italy and also on a ship
at sea.
The tales tell of chivalry, romance,
seduction, courtship, rape, murder, mar-
riage and other forms of bravado, acted
out by fashionable ladies, the male
nobility, actresses, cardinals, monkeys,
caged-birds, melancholics, duellists, pois-
oners, seamen, madmen and three-bottle-
men, approximately 100 years ago. Nor
is Barabbas neglected.
Add to the above geographical phan-
tasmagoria the fact that the book, Seven
Gothic Tales, has been published by H.
Smith, New York, at two and a half
dollars, is being published in England
and may be published in Australia, and
it begins to look as if the world had sud-
denly become a glorious unity populated
by mad publishers. For there is no ques-
tion whatever that the short story in book
form is perishing hard to sell. It is easier
to sell poetry, however good.
The miracle, however, dissolves con-
siderably with a reading of the work. Its
most arresting note is one of surprising
difference from what collections of stories
have lately come to represent—that com-
munity resemblance among them that
many a human family would be relieved
to own and that tendency of the form to
become most classically chill and severe
at the hands of the contemporary
masters.
Dinesen shares none of these traits.
His features hold traces of Poe (exces-
sively pronounced), Balzac (of the ichor
of his minor vein), and Scheherazade ;
with leavening contribution from the
Mary Johnston side of the blanket. As
to the chill airs of the modern classicism,
he is rosy warmth itself.
Except in two rather fine instances,
“The Monkey” and “The Old Chevalier,”
he is much more a tale-teller of the
ancient art than a short-story writer of
the modern craft. He brings his reader
into a warm and confiding place, and
simply spins ’em, with an average
economy of twenty-odd thousand words.
In a couple of them the Poe echo is
rather deafeningly loud; but nqne of
them is contemptible, and one, “The
Deluge at Norderney,” is possibly a mas-
terpiece. It is a tale dark and shaken
with wild waters and black night; the
sea flooded in over smashed walls, and
four persons, with a dog and candle-
lantern, isolated in a loft. Hunched in
the thought, “How will these people do
to die with?”—one in the dress of a
cardinal; a melancholic young man of
fashion ; an impeccable virgin whose old-
maidenhood is made bright by the am-
bitious delusion that she had been a
great courtesan ; and a mystic-neurotic
girl —this strange confederacy has, before
daylight and probable death calls, con-
jured up with their tales, converging into
that damp place, a rich world of glamor.
A great piece of forthright, captivating
tale-telling ; a lamp in Antarctica.
SNOWDEN'S
PLAIN STORY
If the purpose
in these “Week’s
Best” columns
was to approach
c o n t e m p orary
writing with that
dilettanti literary outlook that every plain
man ought to hate, there would be no
room here for such a book as An Auto-
biography, by Philip Snowden (Ivor
Nicholson and Watson; 215., English
price). It is, as removed from dilettanti
literature as its viscount author would
seem to be removed from the “porridge
and stop” penury of his childhood. But
there is more in books than butterflies.
In this one there is chiefly the exceed-
ing plain story of its writer’s life, as bald
as a bad cheque and as self-revealing as a
covered well. It is bad autobiography be-
cause it leaves us to judge its author by
his acts and by his commentary on
those ephemeral external appearances that
are called world affairs. The character
that emerges from an attempted analysis
of such possibly misleading data is of
a shrewd but not a deep thinker, ob-
stinate rather than determined, too cir-
cumstanced a realist to be the idealist
of his aspirations, one who follows logic
—as in his pacifism—only so far as he
finds the going comfortable, by nature
a little peevish and crotchety ; and, on
the other side of the ledger, a character
cast in as simple, clean, straight and fine
a die as Yorkshire has ever turned or
physical imperfections have disguised.
The book is more objectively impor-
tant for it's account of the rise and spread
of the Labor movement in England and
for its revelations of the English war-
time mind, though even here this surface
Pepys puts the brake on hard: he tells,
for instance, of his collected clippings
and extracts from the ungodly utterances
of the clergy during war-time in England,
and adds that he had intended to em-
body them in his book, but that they
were too terrible!
He is not so reluctant to give unholy
facts regarding the treatment of con-
scientious objectors, including such mor-
sels as this: Of England’s 16,000 con-
chies, 1543 took up the absolute-objec-
tion position and were sentenced to two
years’ imprisonment. No fewer than 71
of these died in prison in that two years
or shortly after they had been released
on medical grounds.
Snowden is incisive in his commen-
taries on fellow statesmen, particularly
Lloyd George (a healthy corrective to
much fancy flapdoodle) and Ramsay
MacDonald (“his facility in dancing
round the mulberry bush is not a recently
acquired accomplishment”). Also, he
gives a cordial and,
from him, extraor-
dinarily telling pic-
ture of that pattern
of plain men, l£eir
Hardie, his only
idol, barring the
hypothetical assassi-
nators of Mars and
Bacchus.
A GOOD NOVEL,
BRIEFLY
As the foregoing
two books are, re-
spectively, of the
kind that robustly
entertains and the
kind that baldly in-
forms—and good of
their kind, which is
all that will be asked
here of any book—
this faint novel,
Barnham Rectory, by Doreen Wallace
(Collins; 7s. 6d.), is of the kind that
charms. There is very little in it, but
all that there is is exquisite. It is life
touched with a bubble-delicacy—the liv-
ing at a rectory, the incumbent, his
children, the servants, a virgin betrayed,
a submissive love passing the understand-
ing of the sexual psychoanalystical tub-
thumpers, and a double drowning in a
poor little pond. A close dramatisation of
minutiaj, touched with that fine humor
that women —only women—give, when
they have it.
CECIL MANN.
Through
Muddle to
“Half-Death”
interesting as
a symptom of a
muddled state
of mind common
among aspiring
Australian
authors is Vivian Crockett’s Mezzomorto
(Stephensen; 7s. 6d.).
From a technical point of view, it is
poorly written ; he has made no effort to
construct characters ; therefore the whole
work is unconstructed. The novelist's
ability to project his world into the
reader’s imagination lies entirely in his
power to construct. For construction,
through the development of characters,
the interweaving of their motives and
destinies, Crockett has substituted a stagy
device of psychological mumbo-jumbo.
The book is really not a novel at all,
but a series of historical short stories ;
bound together they meet the exigencies
of a market where the short story is
under a cloud. The nexus is the state of
mind of Brett Lesslie, an Australian of
the third generation who has plenty of
money and a literary education but fails
to find in his homeland a life congenial
to his tastes. For the intellectual and
spiritual solace which in Europe con-
versation and “atmosphere” would pro-
"Little Man, What Ho!” or
"Snowden Revealed,” by Low.
vide, he is driven to
books. This may be
taken as Mr. Crockett’s
own state of mind —a
hankering for the graces
of life so wretchedly
wanting in Australia.
Lesslie gives himself over
to fantasy - mongering,
always dreaming of the
romantic action he would
like to live —an existence
decorated by mezzotirtt
beauties and water-color
buccaneers.
So far so good. Here
Crockett had to ask him-
self whether he was
going to make his story
into a serious work or a
boys’ adventure book.
He thought he was doing
the first, but he was
really doing the second.
Mezzomorto could have
been a serious work only
if he had made it a frank, ruth-
less study of himself as the type
of intellectual frustrate inevitably com-
mon enough in a country where
books, music, pictures and poetry
matter far less than commercial profi-
ciency. He would have had to see his
fantasies, of an existence among people
who did understand these things and
value them, not as a symptom of his
superiority to the crude masses around
him, but as a flight from the real problem
of his life in the crude country he be-
longed to —how to get his satisfactions

from crude, unliterary things instead of
from a bookish mirage.
Considered from this point of view,
Lesslie is an ordinary sort of neurotic
who has been unable to come to terms
with disagreeable but, alas! unalterable
realities, and has tried to run away from
them in daydream. He is not less inter-
esting for being ordinary ; just because
he is so common amongst us he is especi-
ally interesting: and Mr. Crockett, hav-
ing failed to get down to the origins
and substance of this man’s state of
mind—of his own state of mind, of the
state of mind of many, many educated
beings in Australia —having failed to
show us, in their true significance, his
self-pity, his tormenting nostalgias, his
sense of inferiority to English valuations,
and, in the bi-polar phases of that mood,
his aggressive Australianism, leaves the
job still to be done.
Writing makes a particular appeal to
this group of maladjusted beings. It
offers them a means of concreting their
fantasies on paper or of burnishing the
unsatisfying scene around them with
romantic attributes —each in the effort to
avoid adjusting themselves by looking
through their unsatisfactory environment
as though it did not exist or by pretend-
ing that it is better than it is. One finds
them producing works like Mezzomorto
or poetry about fauns and duchesses. The
purpose served here is very much the
same purpose Michael Arlen serves for
his shopgirl public: he allows their
starved souls to wander in remote worlds
agreeably inhabited by the peerage. The
second kind of writing—the effort to
gild the dandelion of our humble scene
—produces works in which simple Aus-
tralians spout like Bloomsbury sophisti-
cates against the background of a Dar-
linghurst so orgiastically in the Zeitgeist
that, from what one hears of it, New
York seems provincial by comparison.
The counterblast to Crockett’s kind of
writing—the weakly, self-indulgent kind
of writing so well analysed in Lawrence’s
pamphlet “Obscenity and Pornography”
—is the carefully realistic work of
Henry Handel Richardson, Katharine
Prichard, Louis Stone, Norman Lindsay
in “Redheap” and Desmond Tate in
parts of “The Doughman,” a motive that
has become dominant in Australian
literature during the last few years.

Fellowship
and Beer
Cecil Mann’s
damnatory article
on the Fellow-
ship of Australian
Writers (R.P.
26/9/’34) proves
that he has never known the misery of
intellectual isolation.
If he were to be denied his frequent
contacts with people who have intelli-
gent, aesthetic or profound ideas, and
condemned to read books without deli-
vering an opinion upon them even to
one friendly listener, then Cecil Mann
would understand why many young
writers do seek an escape from that
“work, loneliness, individualism” ideal
which he urges them to embrace. His
strictures imply that he himself envies
the young writer his opportunities for
uninterrupted work. But, gwen a long
spell of that ideal solitude, he too, like
almost every other creative worker who
has had to live in an uncongenial, friend-
less environment, would eventually seek
the company of his fellow-toilers, not to
receive their praise, but in the hope of
making friendships with a few others
like himself, doing their utmost to pre-
pare themselves mentally, emotionally
and spiritually for the big task in hand.
If he could be thus chastened, and
were to join the Fellowship of Austra-
'lian Writers, Cecil Mann would be aston-
ished. There he would meet novelists
who seldom mention their own or any
other novels, poets who have never been
heard to recite their unpublished master-
pieces and aspiring playwrights who do
not carry the manuscripts of their latest
dramas in their pockets. Whatever its
faults may be, the Fellowship is not
essentially what The Bulletin calls “a
mutual admiration society” ; it has not,
perhaps unfortunately, a Latin Quarter,
Chelsea or Greenwich atmosphere ; the
membership being confined to those who
have actually done or are earnestly trying
to do some worth-while writing, there
is a feeling of sympathy not to be found
in literary societies open to those who
merely talk about letters.
“Straining breaks the bow, and relaxa-
tion relieves the mind,” and, if the writer
is to relax, surely he can do it to best
advantage in the company of those he
respects because of a bond of fellowship.
The young writer can purchase the
authoritative, lifelong assistance of
Roget’s “Thesaurus” and the “Oxford
Dictionary” and make them his only
companions, but, however vigorous his
self-conceit and natural incentives may
be, the tradition-lacking Australian writer
will find them of small value compared
with an occasional meeting with and sizing-
up of his contemporary rivals and those
who have achieved some success in litera-
ture ; therefore, despite Cecil Mann’s
emphasised statement that “they pre-
sume to be instigators of writing,” such
“so-called” writers’ societies as the Fel-
lowship do encourage their members to
greater effort by sending them back to
their loneliness from time to time with
a renewed determination to succeed.
The inaugural Beer Evening held re-
cently by the mere-male members of the
Fellowship was an unofficial attempt to
bring together some of those lonely souls
who had joined in the hope of making
new, invigorating friendships, and, having
attended several lectures and social
“functions” without making more than
passing acquaintanceships in the hour
available, had perhaps come to think that
the Fellowship was not living up to its
high-sounding name. As such it was a
mild-mannered protest against speeches,
musical items and tedious one-act plays:
it was also a determined effort to revive,
if only for a few hours, the old-time pub
atmosphere of Australian literature.
Whether it succeeded in laying the foun-
dations of new friendships I do not
know, but the bright lads of the Fellow-
ship certainly did not justify their exist-
ence by learned dissertations upon litera-
ture, art or philosophy.
When the second Beer Evening is to
be held, Cecil Mann will be invited to
come along and join us in pitying our-
selves, because we have again succumbed
to our eagerness to escape, for one even-
ing in three months, from “work, lone-
liness, individualism.”

A Kick for
Cinderella
The Australian
Literature Society
is arranging a
centenary exhibi-
tion of books by
Australian writ-
ers on the lines of the London precedent
of three years ago. It will open at the
Colonial Mutual Building in Market-
street, Melbourne, in the middle of
November, and qualified spruikers will
act as guides to the treasures of our muse
by delivering lectures. A catalogue will
be issued, and donors are requested to
send their brain-children to the hon. secre-
tary, Marion Agnew, at the address stated.
The society hopes that the expected
flood of literature will be allowed to re-
main on the shelves as a donation to its
library; if not, books will be returned
where postage is provided. The worthy
work is being done at the society’s ex-
pense: it feels that Australian literature,
regarded as the Cinderella of the arts
by the Centenary Council, can be helped
by such gentle kicks along the right road.

MEDITATION AT THE CLOSE OF THE
FINANCIAL YEAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Have 1 wasted my life ? 1 don’t \notv —
And it’s now getting late to retrieve it:
It was rather a lar\ to be rash,
And, besides, if 1 had any cash,
I’d be forced, in the long run, to leave it
To someone 1 never had seen.
Do you grasp what 1 mean ?
All 1 want is three meals and a bed —and I’ve got
’em;
And I’ve seen pretty sights in odd parts of the world.
Furthermore,
1 count it no end of a bore
To be pestered by people who tal\ about nothing but
boo\s.
/ don’t li\e their loo\s
As they come with the flag of their folly unfurled—
’Od rot 'em —
And want me to add to their store
Of wearisome lore
About volumes no sensible man ever reads.
What the world really needs
Is a good deal more thinking, less reading and
leisure enough
To loo\ round at the things hereabout . . .
Let the ultimate go —
It’ll come in good time to let all of us \now
About these bewildering psychic affairs.
So I’ll haw\ no more versical wares
And will ta\e life henceforth for the sun in it:
There is never a boo\ to my name,
And I leave the poetical game
Having failed to find money or fun in it —
Though I wrote some preposterous stuff.

BANKRUPT AND DESPERATE.
The State Governments are all bank-
rupt. This is no effect of the depression ;
they were broke before it arrived,
although they concealed the position by
devices such as borrowing for unpro-
ductive expenditure and for interest on
the same.
During the 11 years 1923-33 the public
debts of the six States increased from
£546,976,000 to £807,852,000. These are
the Commonwealth Statistician’s figures,
and in “Finance Bulletin, No. 24” the
same authority traces the growth of the
State deficits; his table is ironically
headed “State Surplus Revenue,” but
there is a minus sign before each total:
1923 £56,745
1924 355,025
1925 205,365
1926 2,153,518
1927 216,695
1928 1,084,360
1929 3,045,831
1930 8,877,951
1931 15,528,177
1932 20,803,210
1933 7,954,860
State deficits for 11 years £60,281,737
Here and there an annual surplus was
claimed by some State Treasurer, but it
was invariably bogus. And in three
States the deficit totals were kept down
not only by charging ordinary expendi-
ture to loans but by entering up Common-
wealth grants as revenue. For example,
Westralia, which has been receiving
Commonwealth subventions since 1911,
got £300,000 p.a. for the six years to
1932, £500,000 in 1932-33 and £600,000
in 1933-34. Tasmania received £250,000
p.a. for the four years 1929-33 and
£380,000 in 1933-34. To South Australia
went £1,000,000 in 1930-31, £1,000,000
in 1931-32, £1,000,000 in 1932-33 and
£1,150,000 in 1933-34.
What is more, all the States have since
1924-25 shared in Federal-aid road grants
amounting, as a rule, to £2,000,000 p.a.
They have since 1928-29 received be-
tween £8,000,000 and £9,000,000 a year
towards interest and sinking fund on
their debts, in addition to the benefit of
Commonwealth loan conversions at re-
duced rates of interest. They have also
had unemployed-relief grants and
bonuses for their farmers —£2,250,000 in
1932-33.
For the 1933-34 year the State Gov-
ernments announced their deficits at
£5,600,000 ; the Commonwealth Govern-
ment reported a surplus of £1,301,600.
For the current year the State Govern-
ments expect to go another £5,000,000
or £6,000,000 to the bad (the Tasmanian
Treasurer has yet' to be heard from,
but the worst is feared); the Com-
monwealth Government anticipates a
surplus of £13,800. Yet the Common-
wealth Government, out of its accumu-
lated credit balances, has given them an-
other £2,000,000 to play with, besides
adding £20,000 to last year’s special grant
to Tasmania and £250,000 to the free
gift to South Australia. Westralia has
for years been getting more from the
Commonwealth Treasury in one way and
another than it has been raising in State
taxes, and South Australia is now in
the same position. This is how both
States have fared since July, 1928, all
Commonwealth money being included as
revenue: —*
Annual Deficits.
S. Aus. W. Aus.
1928- .. £903,858 £275,968
1929- .. 1,625,824 518,004
1930- .. 1,813,857 1,420,539

1933- .. 844,000 788,912
Deficits for six years .. £12,685,197
And during the 10 years to June 30,
1933, allowing for “remissions by the
Commonwealth in respect of soldier-
settlement losses incurred by the States”
(especially heavy in Westralia and South
Australia), these State Governments
added £57,500,000 to their public debts.
That of South Australia increased from
£66,138,000 to £102,902,000, and that
of Westralia from £62,766,000 to
£83,515,000. Their combined population
is just over a million.
It can’t go on. If the Federal system
is to endure, these States and all the rest
must be put in the way of making ends
meet. With the possible exception of
Tasmania, they have all been wickedly
extravagant, but they have been en-
couraged to be extravagant by a central
Government which places easy money at
their disposal, for expenditure without
responsibility, while continuing a distribu-
tion of duties which is inequitable and out
of date. The State Governments have too
much to do for the money they raise, by
lair means and foul. The Commonwealth
Government can, and should, relieve them
of burdens which have grown too
heavy for them to bear—control of navi-
gation, of industry and of education.
Education in particular could be taken
over with obvious advantages to the
people ; and it would require no consti-
tutional amendment. What does Aus-
tralia want with six systems of Govern-
ment schooling, all tending to foster the
provincial spirit? What does it want with
six Ministers of Education, each with a
personal staff? As often as not the poli-
ticians appointed to these superfluous
offices don’t know B from a bull’s foot.
State expenditure on education
amounted to £9,937,000 in 1931-32 and
to £9,392,728 in 1932-33. It was practi-
cally equivalent to the yield from the
State income and dividend taxes —
£9,288,201 in 1931-32 and £9,607,200 in
1932-33. This suggests that the Com-
monwealth might usefully take over both
education and income tax, and arrange
to levy and collect unemployed-relief
taxes from the States so long as the need
exists. By way of strengthening the
States financially, and also of ending the
maddening taxation chaos, it could sur-
render its land tax (except, of course, as
to Federal territories) and estate duty.
From these sources it got £2,777,700 in
1932-33, but in previous years the yield
was much greater—£4,962,soo in 1929-
30 and £4,827,400 in 1930-31.
Financial reform will have to be
tackled by the reconstructed Common-
wealth Government. The State Govern-
ments are in a desperate position, and
they are doing desperate things. To
reduce the appalling losses on obsoles-
cent railways they are harrying motor-
owners mercilessly, and they have de-
prived the people of the old freedom of
the roads. Four of them are engaged in a
low competition for lottery-money, and
at least one is addressing mugs in the
kind of language used by card-sharpers.
Three are taxing their citizens on income
from other States —income already
taxed by those States and by the Com-
monwealth—which is not far removed
from common swindling.
THE FLYING RABBIT.
Germany invented aerial attacks on civil
populations. In London 522 tombstones
stand as monuments to the capacity of
German airmen for killing women and
children. But time turns tables. The
Versailles Treaty (art'. 198) forbade their
country to own fighting aeroplanes. So
great was “the lust for destruction shown
by Germany’s former enemies”—that is
how one of Herr Hitler’s official asso-
ciations puts it—that “even harmless in-
struments, such as barometers, chrono-
meters and thermometers,” went to the
scrapheap. Hence
The position in which Germany finds
itself to-day as regards aviation —it is
absolutely without protection—cannot be
tolerated any longer.
In order to emphasise the danger in
which he and his compatriots find them-
selves, Herr Hitler’s propagandists have
showered on Australia pamphlets with
the ponderous title: “France’s Air Arma-
ment and Germany’s Menaced Position
from the Air.” The front page is deco-
rated with a picture of a French
fighting squadron and the label
“They Are Coming”; the back sheet
is filled with a drawing of civil'
destruction which might represent what
happened in the heart of London once
or twice if it were not for a battered
effigy of the Saviour, inserted to make it
clear that the scene is laid in Christian
Germany. These morsels are backed
with a complete technical review of
France’s warcraft.
The largest French bomber, according
to Herr Hitler, is manned by six men, has
three double machine-guns, and carries
40001 b. of bombs. It is driven by 2400-
h.p. engines capable of taking it 1300 miles
without landing. There are 40 of these
machines, built and building, and there
are thousands of other monsters of which
the gems are little things like the Han-
riot fighters, which can fire 600 shots a
minute while travelling at 270 m.p.h. and
climb 15,000 ft. in 6min. 30sec. So Herr
Hitler, who is spending only £16,000,000
on aviation this year—his own figures —
feels forlorn and frightened with
“16,100 war ’planes against the Reich’s
vacuum.”
Other countries are no less scared.
The day after the German pamphlet
reached Australia the Japanese War
Office issued another which might
have been a paraphrase of it. Called
“The Real Meaning of Defence,” it
points out that “the U.S.A. has 3000 war
’planes, the U.S.S.R. another 3000 and
China 500, 3000 of which would be im-
mediately available for use against
Japan, which has only 1000 machines.”
On the same day one of the U.S.A.’s
million generals froze the blood of “a
commission in Washington. Japan,
General Mitchell said, was Uncle Sam’s
most dangerous enemy, and “U.S.A.
aeroplanes should be designed to attack
Japan... .Fifty dirigibles could destroy
Japan within two days if war broke
out.” The U.S.A. “should develop air-
craft with a cruising range of 6000 to
8000 miles. Russia possessed ’planes
with a range of 3500 miles” —presum-
ably some of the “mighty force of heavy
bombers” which Comrade Voroschiloff
mentioned not long ago.
With this sort of thing going on, Mr.
Stanley Baldwin will have to revise his
dictum that the borders of England have
shifted to the Rhine and place them
somewhere in the Pacific. Already a
French ’plane has flown from New York
to Syria without a stop—sB34 miles. A
British bomber has been hours in
the air on a flight of 5430 miles. The
French performance equals a direct jour-
ney from California to Australia; the
British, one from Kobe to Hobart, with
a little to spare. Both were made in
slow machines.
Our own Kingsford Smith has flown
2175 miles from Westralia to N. S. Wales
in 9\ hours. This performance the
“Daily Mail” described as being “worthy,
not only of admiration, but also of deep
thought.”
As air speed advances the potential
menace to an undefended civilian popula-
tion grows. The lesson for Britain is
that safety lies in the possession of an air
fleet big and fast enough to prevent an
enemy making the first attack.
It is the lesson for Australia, too.
Australia, however, has none of the
fears which afflict other countries. Herr
Hitler, at least, has 32 aircraft factories
in Germany which build everything from
the huge Dornier Wal Supers, which
weigh 52,0001 b. loaded, to the natty Ju-60
expresses, which are as heavily engined
as any fighter. He has Fokker next
door in Holland. So if he hasn’t an
aerial force it wouldn’t take him long
to get one.
Australia, on the other hand, hasn’t
a factory which could build one efficient
machine and engine it. It couldn’t
modernly arm a Gipsy Moth out of its
own resources, much less a heavy
bomber. It doesn’t possess a squad-
ron of fighters which could handle the
slowest of the French machines which
the Hitler propaganda details. But it has
a Prime Minister who recently prided
himself on having “led the anti-conscrip-
tion forces during the war,” and who did
not contradict one of his Ministers, now
defeated, who cried out that his leader
would never allow compulsory military
training of youth. It has a Minister for
Defence who has permitted Australia to
agree to a transocean service which will
be out of date as to speed by the time
it is running. And when half its capital
navy damaged its only seaplane and
thus became 50 p.c. ineffective for fight-
ing, it had to send the damaged article
across the continent from Perth to Syd-
ney to be repaired.
True, a squadron of modern British
fighting machines is to be added to the
R.A.A.F. But the range of these
machines is only a few hundred miles.
Highly complex organisms, they will be
useless away from one or two bases.
But nobody worries. It is more im-
portant to placate an extreme vote than
to protect the country. So Australia,
which bred the Diggers and Kingsford
Smith and Hinkler, is compelled by the
Pearces and the Scullins and the Langs
to adopt the role of flying rabbit, and
to cower under the clouds at the mercy of
any rapacious nation which cares to
pounce on it and do to its cities on a
larger and deadlier scale what Germany
did to London and Paris. There is no
need for alarmism, but there is such a
thing as common prudence.
THE MELBOURNE SABBATH.
This famous institution has lately come
in for renewed criticism and defence,
and the ordinary unsophisticated lay-
man, unused to theological methods of
conducting a controversy, is staggered at
the amount of muddled thinking dis-
played.
The Sabbatarian argument is a two-
pronged fork. One prong is that the
Melbourne Sunday was ordained as a
day of rest. But, according to Holy Writ,
the seventh day was set apart for this
purpose, and the seventh day is Satur-
day. And the seventh day was observed
as a day of rest by non-Jewish races
long before the Pentateuch was written.
It was no sacred ordinance but a taboo,
and the taboo extended to all sorts of
sevenths. Thus, the seventh year was a
taboo year for agriculture ; the fields had
then to be left unfallowed.
Probably the lawgiver who first
lathered the device had precisely the
same idea as the modern Arbitration
Court adjudicator. He considered that
one year’s rest in seven was necessary
to restore the soil, and that one day’s
rest in seven would repair the physical
activities of the husbandman ; in lands
like China, where the daily grind goes
on from year’s end to year’s end, labor
is notoriously inefficient. If the Sab-
batarians based their argument on this
fact they would be more logical. By
basing it on the Fourth Commandment
they condemn a large number of un-
offending citizens to damnation. For
Sunday is not a day of rest in Melbourne
for thousands of cable- and wireless-
operators, tram- and train-drivers, police-
men, electrical engineers, garage attend-
ants and broadcasting announcers,
though they usually get time ofE during
the week, when there are more facilities
for enjoyment.
When I was a boy the Melbourne
Sabbath was more strictly observed than
it is to-day, and there was consequently
even more hypocrisy about it. In my
home the girls were not allowed to sew
buttons on my trousers, but they might
knit ornamental woolwork. They were
forbidden to play Chopin and Beethoven
on the piano, but permitted to play
hymns. Our next-door neighbors went
further. They were not allowed to dis-
cuss politics or literature, but they talked
scandal over the fence ; they could play
chess, but not ludo ; they could walk
to visit their friends, but not ride their
bicycles. It was an offence to sing or
whistle, but the girls went to church in their
most attractive costumes, and the boys
plastered their hair with cocoanut oil
and made eyes at other girls.
The family on the other side com-
pletely ignored the taboo, even to the
extent of not compelling their children
to go to Sunday school. I waited for
a thunderbolt to strike them, but no-
thing happened. Still forced to go to
Sunday school, I acquired such a sense
of injustice that I consistently diverted
the penny for the collection-plate from
the succor of the colored heathen to the
corner lollyshop.
It is time the theologians became more
sensible about it. There would be no
sense in turning the Melbourne Sabbath
into another day of the week, because
none of the other days in the week, with
their inane daily newspapers and silly
American forms of entertainment, is
worthy of emulation. But if there were
sufficient facilities for the mass of the
people to get to places where they can
amuse themselves, and hear good music,
and see good plays, and so forth, there
would be a distinct improvement. People
are too neurotic nowadays, and to give
them more opportunities for neuras-
thenia in the weekday manner would
be folly. But to keep them cooped up
in their homes or playing in the streets
outside them is no rest cure.
The average Melbourne home is hell
on a hot Sunday. Well-to-do people can
escape from it in their cars. Other
people cannot, and this fills them with
resentment.
What Sabbatarians are principally
afraid of is that if rival attractions were
permitted there would be a falling-off
in the collection. The answer to that
is that they have the opportunity of
making their services more attractive.
Competition could be kept on an equit-
able basis by imposing the collection-
plate method on their rivals, except where
there is a genuine artistic purpose, as in
symphony concerts. The extra hands
employed might be given a day off dur-
ing the week, when they could attend
church services if they wished to. There
are far more opportunities for worship
in Melbourne on weekdays and far
more genuinely religious persons who

PLAIN ENGLISH.
No Time for Wrangling.
The negotiations of Messrs. Lyons and
Page were surrounded by the press with
a stockade of optimism.
After the first day’s meeting, it was
“hoped that a satisfactory basis for dis-
cussion could be reached” and that it
would be “possible to draft a concrete
and practicable plan” for submission to
the Agrarian members:
Mr. Lyons has made an offer to the
C.P. on the basis of two full portfolios
and an assistant-Ministership, and is pre-
pared to discuss co-operation in a
friendly manner on that basis. He is not
prepared to submit to any dictation on
portfolios or policy; his policy is that
which he has placed before the people.
Next day it came from Mr. Lyons’s
own lips that he had made “a definite and
final offer” which Dr. Page would “con-
vey to the C.P. on Monday.”
It appeared from his party press re-
ports that he had “conceded something
to the C.P.”—he had “offered them three
full portfolios.” And if they didn’t like
it they might lump it: he would form his
Ministry within his own party.
Mr. Bruxner, leader of the N. S.
Wales Country party, is Deputy Pre-
mier, and the arrangement has worked
well. Feeling among the Commonwealth
Agrarians is that they may fairly bespeak
a corresponding position for Dr. Page,
along with Ministerial representation in
proportion to their numbers. For the
rest they ask for a Tariff Board in-
terpretation of Article 10 of the Ottawa
Agreement,
The tariff shall be based on the prin-
ciple that protective duties shall not ex-
ceed such a level as will give United King-
dom producers full opportunity of reason-
able competition on the basis of the relative
cost of economical and efficient production,
special consideration to be given to indus-
tries not fully established.
They are also after a review of inter-
national trade relations as a preliminary
to action designed to sell Australian pro-
duce to the best advantage. All land
men are seriously concerned about the
outlook, and well they might be. At best,
on present prices, Australia will get
£35,000,000 for its wool this year even if
all withdrawals are sold; and unless
overseas buying expands there will be
a great deal of wool in store at the end
of the season. And market prospects for
wheat and dairy produce are far from
cheering.
The situation is such as to call not
only for co-operation between the
U.A.P. and the U.C.P., but for a
national Government. The divergences
of policy between Labor and Conserva-
tives in Britain are far wider than those
which separate the three constitutional
parties in Australia; but when a crisis
arrived in 1931 Conservatives, Labor-
ites and Liberals joined in a national
Government, and the electors over-
whelmingly approved. They would do
the same in Australia.

Westralia’s Welcome.
Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, has
been whirled through South Westralia.
At Fremantle he was met by Mr. C. W.
C. Marr, smiling and apparently at peace
with all the world, though nursing a
secret sorrow —it came out that he had
resigned from the Ministry—and by
Mr. G. F. Pearce, the Commonwealth
elections being over. But Labor Premier
Collier was missing, and it was explained
that he was ill, though his indisposition
had nothing to do with the resolution at
a public meeting in Perth that his Gov-
ernment had “completely lost the con-
fidence of the people.” Another ab-
sentee was Mr. J. MacCallum Smith,
M.L.A., who had had to hurry away to
London with the Case for Secession,
leaving the news to be broken afterwards
that he had placed his secesh newspaper
under offer to financiers from the
other side of the cormorant Common-
wealth.
In England, the Duke is known as an
unassuming young man who may be
seen paying his twopence in the tube like
any fish-porter. But the common touch
doesn’t appeal to Westralian Labor,
which arranged for him a dance in one
of the Yartchep caves. Yanchep is a
public park, but it was closed to the
public on this occasion, and police were
posted to stop democrats intruding. De-
tectives also hung round to see that girls
didn’t drink too much cocktail or sit out
too long in cars. It is recorded that the
royal visitor read and re-read newspaper
protests against this sorry piece of snob-
bery.
Very different emotions were inspired
by the announcement that the King had
approved of the alliance of the Duke’s
regiment, the 10th Hussars, with West-
ralia’s own 10th Light Horse, which
served, dismounted, in Gallipoli, fought
gloriously all through the Desert cam-
paign, and was first into Damascus.
The Duke is a welcome visitor, as
were his father and his two elder
brothers before him; and Australians
hope that toadyism and flunkeyism will
not prevent him from getting to know
something of the real Australia.

The Alphabetical Superstition.
Senate-election results explode the
belief that it is a great advantage to a
candidate to have a name beginning with
A, B, C or D.
Certainly an A (Abbott) was elected in
N. S. Wales —there is none in the House
now —but a B (Barnes) and two Ds
(Dunn and Dooley) lost their seats. If
there were anything in the alpha-
betical theory, the B-B-C ticket, made
possible by the infatuated Seabrook
changing his name by deed poll, should
have won in Tasmania, especially as Best,
Broad and Ceabrook enjoyed the ad-
vantage, denied to the U.A.P. and Labor
lots, of being grouped. As it happened,
the B-B-C ticket was beaten hands
down, Grant, Hayes and Hays being
returned. South Australia, for its part,
rejected a Labor ticket beginning with
D (Dawes) for one with two Ms and a
U (McLachlan, McLeay and Uppill).
Two more Cs go in and another may
—Cooper in Queensland. If he does
six Cs will be entitled to take their seats
on July 1,.1935: Carroll, Collett, Col-
lings, Cox, Cooper and Courtenay.
There will be six Ms also —J. V. Mac-
Donald, A. J. McLachlan, J. McLach-
lan, McLeay, Millen and A. N. Mac-
Donald —as against the solitary A, four
Bs —Badman, Brennan, Brown and
Brand —and only two Ds—Dein and
Duncan-Hughes. Admittedly there were
a great many informal votes, but this
is bound to happen when a custom with
which people are familiar is altered at the
eleventh hour. Told at previous elections
that their ballot-papers would be valid
if they voted for seven candidates, they
were advised at the eleventh hour that
they would have to vote for the lot—
and there were 12 in Queensland, 13 in
N. S. Wales, 13 in Westralia and 14 in
Tasmania. Even so, they are not such
mugs as politicians apparently take them
for.

Cheaper Beer.
Notwithstanding that the prohibition-
ist is a greater power in the land in
Maoriland than in any of the Australian
States and that the depression hit the
Dominion rather harder than it did this
continent, Finance Minister Coates has
been able to lop 3d. off the excise duty
on beer. It now stands at 9d. a gallon,
exactly a shilling less than is imposed in
Australia.
Prior to October, 1933, the Australian
duty was 2s. a gallon. The reduction of
3d., amounting to three-eighths of a
penny per pint, was hardly worth
attempting to pass on to the public, but
here and there Bung went in for new
tumblers and mugs which allegedly con-
tain the extra 4.34 p.c. of liquor called
for by the Federal Government’s gener-
osity.
The Maoriland concession leaves the
tax on the pint at a penny and one-
eighth—lB| p.c. if what Major Douglas
would call the “just price” of beer is
6d. a pint. The Australian impost
amounts to 43| p.c. Both figures are too
high; the Australian tax absurdly so.
The British duty, which has also been
reduced in recent times, ranges from Bd.
per gallon upwards according to specific
gravity, with most of the output, natur-
ally, at the minimum figure.
Why beer on this side of the world
should be subject to the sort of taxation
which elsewhere is reserved for the most
expensive wines and liqueurs it is not
easy to discover. Quite certainly, so far
as Australia is concerned, it runs counter
to public sentiment. Beer is, after tea,
the most popular national beverage, and
only a very easy-going electorate would
allow its price to be doubled—for that
is the next effect of a savage excise duty
plus the other fierce taxation to which
brewers and publicans are subjected.
It is time someone revived the cry
heard years ago in England: “Hands off
the people’s beer!”

The Luck of Mr. Stuart Doyle.
“Architrave” : Providence is indeed
kind to Mr. Stuart Doyle (B. 3/10/ ’34).
He objected to the building of
rival theatres in Sydney, and he didn’t
want a film quota. Now the Melbourne
Government has dropped its Film Quota
Bill, and the Sydney Government has
vetoed the building of a £250,000 theatre
which would cut into Mr. Stuart Doyle’s
business.
Regulations under the N.S.W. Theatres
and Public Halls Act of 1908, under
which the Chief Secretary may grant or
refuse permission to build, state that a
theatre “having one full frontage to a
public thoroughfare” shall have “two
courts, each not less than 10 feet wide,
.... extending for their full width from
or near the proscenium wall to a public
thoroughfare” and “open to the sky.”
Mr. Stuart Doyle’s State Theatre has
two courts ; one is partly built over. The
Prince Edward has no court; neither has
the Mayfair. The St. James has two,
one built over. Ministerial sanction was
given in all these cases. The theatre just
rejected was turned down largely be-
cause one of its two courts was not open
to the sky, although it complied with
regulations to which other Sydney
theatres do not conform.
Item 10 of the regulations says: “Ap-
proved fire-resisting construction shall
be used throughout.” There are Sydney
theatres which have timber balconies
with electric mains running underneath.
The plans of the new theatre provided
for solid concrete right through—gal-
leries and roof included.
Another regulation says that there
shall be no more than 14 chairs in a
row between passages and gangways in
any theatre. Mr. Doyle’s State has 19
seats per row in most rows, and has
one row of 72 seats. The Capitol, an-
other Stuart Doyle theatre, has 22 seats
per row. The plans of the vetoed theatre
provided for 12 seats per row.
Yes, Mr. Stuart Doyle’s luck is pheno-
menal.

More Government-controlled
Gambling.
Mr. Weaver, N. S. Wales Minister for
Health, is leading a section of the State
Cabinet in a bid for the control of lot-
teries through the Hospitals Commission,
of which he is chairman. When Mr.
Weaver takes the reins, he will run more
and bigger gambles, since the popularity
of the State lottery has fallen off of late
and the lotteries of other States must be
countered.
Last year, the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment, whose Premier does not believe in
gambling, if report can be believed, sold
£1,847,000 worth of lottery tickets as
compared with £2,054,000 the year be-
fore. Out of this, the profit was £641,000.
This amount will not meet the needs
of the hospitals—their deficits will be
about £450,000, in spite of the Govern-
ment’s oblations to chance.
There are hospitals and charities which
do not show deficits —the group of small
ones in Sydney which are allowed to run
big lotteries of their own. The Bulletin
has called attention to their methods —•
and to their luck, which seems to be
as great as that of even Mr. Stuart
Doyle.
It would seem that £1,100,000 would
meet the hospitals’ immediate needs ; so
that a community sickness insurance
scheme which yielded lfd. per head of
population per week would make them
solvent.
But there are votes to be considered.
So it is proposed to compete with the
lotteries from other States, one of
which is estimated to have sold 84,200
tickets in N. S. Wales last year —quite
against the law, of course, since the Lot-
teries Act says:
Whoever sells or offers for sale or
accepts any money in respect of the pur-
chase of a ticket in a foreign lottery [which
means a lottery conducted “outside the
State of N. S. Wales”] shall be liable to
a penalty not exceeding £2O.
The maximum penalty for publishing
information regarding a “foreign” lot-
tery or its result is £2OO. This seems to
offer a second easy solution of Mr.
Weaver’s hospital difficulties. He merely
needs to collect 5000 of the notices with
which one of his rivals floods N. S.
Wales every few weeks and get the
senders or distributors fined the maxi-
mum for each offence.
Anybody who has seen a Sydney Court
reeling off traffic fines will admit that
this scheme will carry less overhead than
an inflated gamble setting out to com-
pete with illegality.

Atalanta Down.
In Queensland Qantas has had its first
serious mishap for seven years. During
12 years the pilots of this pioneer com-
pany have flown 2,211,106 miles with
passengers. They began with ’buses
which were hard put to it to average
70 m.p.h. They were just taking off
the Atalanta, a D.H.50 four-passenger
job, built in Longreach in Central
Queensland, to replace her with one of
the new D.H.86s —modern editions of
the D.H. Dragons, with four engines and
an unparalleled safety margin—when she
crashed in level, open country, 16 miles
south of Winton.
The Atalanta was a historic machine.
Seven years old, she had a 450-h.p.
Bristol Jupiter engine and had been
used by Lester Brain, the present chief
pilot of the co., on the expeditions on
which he found the body of Keith An-
derson, beside his wrecked ’plane near
the Murrinji, and rescued Moir and
Owen, marooned on the Arnhem coast
after their cross-the-world flight. It was
Owen who found the charred remains
of the Atalanta and her passengers and
of her pilot, who had trained on the diffi-
cult Tasmania-Melbourne route.
According to Hudson Fysh, managing
director of Qantas, the machine was in
perfect order when it set out on its flight.
It would be flying low because of dust.
Qantas methods of inspection are rigid.
During the same week a Hillman
airliner bound for Paris came to grief.
She was one of the latest De Havilland
Dragons, with a cruising speed of 140
m.p.h., flying regularly from London to
Paris in 90 minutes. Either of her two
engines—set wide apart on either wing—
was capable of sustaining her. Both were
high-efficiency 250-h.p. jobs. Based on
the one specimen of the ’plane seen in
Sydney, it would be difficult to imagine
a combustion accident to one of the
breed. Yet, in a blinding storm something
happened which suggested that “there
had been an explosion in the air.” Seven
persons were killed, including the pilot.
Man has made great strides towards
the conquest of the air, but perfect safety
has not been attained. Perhaps it never
will be.

“Uncontrollable Impulse.”
At Kyogle (N.S.W.) an Australian-born
Chinese shopkeeper “committed an act
of indecency in the presence of a girl
12 years of age.” The child com-
plained to her father, a doctor, and the
father “immediately armed himself with
a blackthorn walking-stick and went
round to the offender’s shop.” He pro-
ceeded then and there to give the Chinese
an unmerciful thrashing, a bizarre touch
being supplied by an agonised offer of
£lO from the victim if the doctor would
stop belaboring him.
Sequels occurred last week. The
Chinese appeared before a Children’s
Court, was convicted of “an act of in-
decency,” fined £lO and bound over to
be of good behavior for 12 months. In
the Police Court the doctor pleaded
guilty to assault and was fined 10s.
and ordered to pay court and medical
expenses.
In many parts of the U.S.A. the
Chinese would have been strung up and
riddled with bullets or burned alive. In
Germany he would probably have been
dealt with by a Nordic revolver-party.
In France the affair might have led to
a political scandal and the overthrow
of the Government, the corpse of the
Chinese being discovered after a week
or so in circumstances "suggestive of
suicide, or of murder by the police,
according to the political bias of indi-
vidual citizens. The Australian way is
certainly better, but it is questionable if
it doesn’t put too big a strain on the
forbearance of parents. It is no com-
fort to a parent to know that the full
penalties of the law will be exacted when
the said penalties don’t go within miles
of fitting the crime.
It is significant, in this connection, that
the father, who was mildly—very mildly
—rebuked by the P.M. for “taking the
law into his own hands,” should have
been a doctor. Medical evidence is
nearly always called in these cases to
show that the accused acted under what
is called “uncontrollable impulse,” and
now and then an offender is sent
to hospital for treatment instead of
to prison. Evidently even doctors are
liable to reject the theory of sexual
irresponsibility where those near and
dear to them are concerned, and even
magistrates are disposed to sympathise
when doctors break the law in adminis-
tering what they regard as justice. If
Australia doesn’t want far more serious
assaults than the Kyogle one, it will have
to change its outlook on sexual aberra-
tions. Either the people who commit
such acts are criminals who may drive
normally law-abiding citizens to commit
manslaughter, or they are lunatics and
should be automatically relegated to
asylums.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Whittington”: The city fathers of
Collingwood (Vic.) are always providing
municipal sensations. For a long time a
dispute raged as to who was or who
should be Mayor., That settled, for the
moment, the Mayor-elect announced that
he had appointed another councillor’s
wife Mayoress-elect, to the exclusion of
his own missus, who was present. That
lady’s protest may reach the law courts ;
but what is a mayoress, anyhow?
Webster’s definition is “the wife of a
mayor or a woman holding the office of
mayor,” and in this case the Mayoress-
elect is obviously neither. A bachelor
burgomaster, of course, or a widower or
a man \yhose wife jibs fit being a mayor-
ess can fill the gap as he pleases, and
usually does it with some near-relative,
but whether the wife of a mayor can be
passed over against her will is another
pair of sleeves. Incidentally, when a
woman is elected mayor—as occasionally
happens ; I believe the first recorded in-
stance was in Maoriland —what precise
title is assigned to her husband, if any?
If a mayor’s wife is ipso facto (except
at Collingwood) a mayoress, a mayor’s
husband should surely hold some sort
of brevet rank.

“Runa”: If “Findy” (B. 3/10/’34) had
some years ago visited Newmarket, a
small suburb of Auckland (M.L.), he
would have been interested to note that
the shopping area included no butcher.
There were two dealers in animal tissue,
one of whom described himself as a
“Flesher” and the other as a “Purveyor
of Meat.”
“Flash”: Reference to absurd news-
paper illustrations (B. 26/9/’34) reminds
me that “S.M.H.” published a print of a
grove of pawpaws, described as a “fine
example of the luxuriant growth of the
cocoanut palm on Lindeman Island.”
The stumpy pawpaw-tree, with its broad,
palmated leaves, is about as much like
the stately, towering cocoanut, with its
crown of lOft.-long feathers, as “S.M.H.”
is like one of the “sporting” rags sold on
street corners on race mornings.

“Lalapaloosa”: For inappropriateness
the names chosen to ornament the
fa?ades of some of Sydney’s multitudi-
nous blocks of flats would be hard to beat.
There are several “St. Anthony’s,”
though the picture of St. Anthony in
a “modern flat, select, all mod. con.,”
is a trifle incongruous, and in one short
street I walked down the other day I
saw Saints Revana and Mervyn, essayist
Emerson and lawyer Blackstone—the last
in purplish-colored tapestry brick—all
commemorated within a hundred yards.
Is this sort of thing done to help the post-
man, or is it that flat-dwellers are sup-
posed to get an extra thrill from living
behind such imposing names?
“Casca”: I wonder how many Aus-
tralian newspapers include Greek type
among their mechanical equipment. Not
more than three or four, I should say.
Sydney “Sun” is one; it is print-
ing limericks (of all things) in the tongue
of Homer and the characters that pre-
serve the wisdom of Plato. If we must
have Greek limericks, they certainly
look better —or less awful—in their
native , dress. Readers of Bret Harte will
remember what happened to Colonel
Starbottle when one of his contributions
to a Californian newspaper included a
long quotation from the Greek. The
editor was forced to reproduce it as best
he could in English type, and the un-
familiar product left his readers puzzled.
As the colonel was known to be familiar
with the dialects of several Indian tribes
they decided that it was Choctaw.

“Templar”: Judicial ideas on the sub-
ject of a place of eternal punishment
have apparently changed. Over 40 years
ago I was at the Old Bailey when a very
small girl was placed in the witness-box,
and some doubt was expressed by one
of the counsel engaged as to whether
she was old enough to understand the
nature of an oath. The Recorder took
a hand. “Do you know,” he asked the
little one, “what God will do to you if
you do not tell the truth?” “Put me in
hell,” quavered the witness. The Recorder
nodded as one satisfied with the
answer, and the child was sworn.
Exactly the same situation cropped up
in the Victorian County Court the other
day, except that the witness was a boy.
“Do you know,” asked Judge Foster,
“what happens to a person who does not
“Marry, come up, fayre ladye, and thou shalt be next. Beshrew me if I have
not three stools and no waiting.”
tell the truth?” “You go to hell,” said
the youngster, and the report continues:
Judge Foster said that was a dreadful
thing to teach children. There was no
such thing as hell.
Reassuring, perhaps, but it would be in-
teresting to know what answer would
have satisfied the Bench. Merely an
admission of the danger of being pro-
secuted for perjury?

“Murihiku”: Wellington (M.L.) people
are already becoming centenary-con-

1839, and the first immigrant ship entered
the harbor a month later. On January
30, 1840, Captain Hobson hoisted the
Union Jack at the Bay of Islands, and
announced the extension of the boun-
daries of New South Wales to include
Maoriland, which was gazetted a separ-
ate colony in November of the same
year. So 1940 must be the official cen-
tenary.
“Side Slip”: One of the greatest
advances in aviation that Australia has
seen has been exhibited in Melbourne,
though the dailies took little notice.
It is an autogyro, the machine without
wings which is able to ascend almost
vertically, hover over one spot for an
indefinite time and come to earth on a
space no bigger than the average subur-
ban backyard. Invented by a Spaniard,
and bought and perfected by Britain, it
has a windmill of three vanes at right-
angles to the fuselage mounted on a
staff, with engine and screw for for-
ward movement. The vanes are geared
to the engine for a start. Once aloft they
are disconnected, and thereafter spin by
the action of the air, supporting the ’plane
from hovering to the maximum speed of
90 m.p.h. Minimum landing speed is
5 m.p.h., and stalling, the cause of. 90
per cent of aeroplane crashes, is. im-
possible.

ls ln error when he writes that the
double-ended shell-firing gadget tried in
Sinai in 1916 for aerial warfare “totally
disappeared.” The device, of course, was
the Davis gun with centre-breech load-
ing, and was a subject for instruction
in the gunnery and armament school at
Eastchurch (R.N.A.S.) even in late 1917.
Its limitation was not in the anti-recoil
action of the dummy rear charge, but
in the necessarily restricted arc of fire,
If the traverse of the rear barrel had
been a matter of chance, the Davis
would, in the excitement of battle aloft,
have surely demolished one’s own tail
planes or other vitals per medium of
the weighty rear charge. “Centurion’s”
reference to newly-devised ' “automatic
pom-poms firing 21b. shells” reminds me
that a French fighting squadron tried
sawn-off Hotchkiss 14-pounders in 1916.
The sturdily-built Farmans would just
about stand the non-recoil pounding, but
several machines of less robust build
shed their wings when the gun was fired,
and that was the end of the innovation.
One can picture the relief of the attacked
enemy upon seeing his adversary shake
himself to pieces.
"The O’D.”: Callers at Canon Ham-

last two words were written by a dif-
ferent pencil.
“Pardon Me”: “Tarry Rope” is a little
bit out in his calculations as to how
200,000 h.p. of the Queen Mary would
extend in horseflesh (B. 3/10/’34). The
unit of horse-power was defined by Watt
(1814): “A horse going at the rate of 24
m.p.h. raises a weight of 1501 b. by a rope
passing over a pulley, which is equal to
the raising of 33,0001 b. one foot high in
a minute.” Though it is supposed that
Boulton and Watt took their standard as
a result of experiments made with Lon-
don brewery horses, it is obvious that to
visualise horses expressing 200,000 horse-
power we should have to include 200,000
pulleys. To allow these 200,000 horses to
raise 33,0001 b. one foot in a minute we
should have to provide them with space
equivalent to something more like 100
than 25 miles —even working them eight
abreast (obviously impossible).

“Tripod”: There were two delightful
happenings in sporting contests in Pales-
tine which most Light Horsemen will
remember. The first was when “Bluey”
Ward, after having k.o.’d Les Phillips in
the final of the heavyweight tournament,
threw out a challenge to the audience —
and was knocked cold in one hit by an
acceptor, who turned out to be Bombar-
dier Wells. The other occasion was in
a cricket match with some “chooms,”
when the Aussies suddenly found that
one of their opponents was Johnny
Douglas. Our lads, however, had the
last laugh when the Englishmen were all
dismissed for 11 runs. The bearded
youth who had done most of the damage
was then revealed as Cotter. Very soon
afterwards poor “Tibby” got his issue
while relieving a sick cobber on fatigue
duty.
“Dum Spiro”: In Sydney’s new type
of trams attention is drawn to the penalty
for “spitting.” It is a good Anglo-
Saxon word, and much more accurate
than the polysyllabic equivalent which
has come to be regarded as more polite.
Years ago, when the Perth City Council
gazetted a by-law designed to
keep the pavements cleaner, a
delinquent brought a large dic-
tionary into the police court with
him and joined issue, in legal
phrase, on this particular point.
He admitted having “spat” but
denied having “expectorated,”
and he dilated on the difference.
The beak, however, overruled the
contention—and the dictionary—
and, as no higher Court has been
asked for a ruling, it is still presumably
as dangerous to spit as to expectorate
on Perth kerbs.

“Bugbilonga”: When “Sealed Pattern”
(B. 26/9/’34) states that the Sunday -
afternoon tariff for walking out with a
Guardsman is 2s. 6d. he is, of course,
referring to the Grenadiers. The Scots
Guards’ fee is a pound of genuine North-
of-Tweed shortbread cake. The Welsh
Guards ask two leeks or four onions,
which are handed over to the sergeant
of the guard on the return of the late-
pass men. The “Buffs,” the “Mutton
Lancers” and the K.R. Rifles make a
monetary charge —unobtrusively dropped
into a box camouflaged as a cart-
ridge pouch. The “Green Howards” and
the Devons unashamedly carry pukka
collection-boxes abroad. The “Cherry
Pickers” have ticket-punches and a sys-
tem of cross-checking by their regimen-
tal police, while the Lincolns give vellum
receipts bearing their crest and signed
by their colonel-in-chief. All regular
regiments have walking-out charges,
either in cash or in kind. On the other
hand, men of the “Terriers,” whose
walking-out nattiness approximates to
that of the G.I.P. Regiment of India, the
Zampur-Bukabad State Levies, the Uga-
gugaland Irregulars and our own
George Pearce’s Rough and Readies,
have to pay for the privilege of taking
girls out.
CEN-TEEN-ARY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“tlio Duke pronounced the word cen—teen-ary, anti
mi settled that argument.”
He landed by the silver Swan
When Austral shores resplendent shone
In summer’s gold-and-greenery;
And gave his ruling straight away
Without a moment of delay,
Pronouncing it cen-tmi-ary.
A Prince, he’s diligently made
The military art his trade,
His manly pastime venery;
Yet never doubt that what he says
Will go, in various other ways,
Including the cen-tee/i-ary.
You learned etymologists
And profs, who know the turns and twists
Of all our tongue’s machinery,
For argument’s no further call
Or chance. The question once for all
Is settled —it’s cen-tecu-ary.
He’s come from far to touch the spring
That starts the Melbourne revelling
And brighten up the scenery.
Now all who give the word a spin
Will have the royal warrant in
Pronouncing it cen-fceu-ary.

“Mudurup”: Many candidates have
stood for Parliament in absence, handi-
capped either by distance or illness, but
I can only recall one in Australia who
was unable to cast his own vote for him-
self because he Was in gaol. ‘This was
a wandering orator and argumentative
cheapjack named Percy Brunton, known
in Sydney as “The Peanut King,” and
even better known in his native
Westralia as a person who was fre-
quently in holts with the Law —he
would obstruct thoroughfares. Percy
nominated himself for a suburban seat,
and was pursuing his candidature with
"All the Best People are wearing them on the beaches, madam."
characteristic energy when a heartless
magistrate gave him six months. Even
then he polled enough votes to keep him
from either bottoming the poll or forfeit-
ing his deposit. A few years later this
strenuous alfresco controversialist, whose
battered plug hat was one of his most
cherished possessions, fell off a steamer
between Sydney and Newcastle and
ceased to exist. Some people reckoned
that only his volubility and cantanker-
ousness prevented him from becoming
a front-rank politician.

“Selma”: Cigarette cards? Ten-year-
old Bill showed me his collection the
other day. Like most of his contem-
poraries, he specialises in cricketers.
Several Woodfulls, McCabes and Pons-
fords I examined and admired ; then he
produced a battered card, the face worn
off with handling, and explained in a
hushed voice that it represented Brad-
man. Constant exchanges, always at an
advanced figure, had removed all sem-
blance of Don from the treasure.

“Adelaide”: An odd lawsuit in S.A.
Supreme Court was concerned with
some 46,000 shares in Drug Houses of
Australia, which in 1930 absorbed an
old-standing Bickford business in Adel-
aide. A lady of the Bickford family
in 1928 willed to a relative her shares
in this ; the amal-
gama t i o n took
place, and she re-
ceived shares in
the new co. in-
stead ; but the will
had not been
altered when she
died in 1933. “No
Bickford shares
were held by her
at her death,” rules
Judge Piper, “and
so there has never
been any subject-
matter on which
the bequest could
operate.” He added
candidly: “I feel
that her expecta-
tion, as it probably
remained up to the
time of her death, has been defeated. But
that, of course, cannot affect my reading
of her will.” The non-legal mind might
be excused for querying that “of course.”

“C. Coral”: Our Lawrence Har-
grave, besides being a pioneer in aerial
experiments, took a keen interest in
Australia’s early history, and read some
valuable papers thereon to the Historical
Society of N.S.W. His own visits to
Torres Strait in the ’seventies as engineer
in the Chevert had given him the oppor-
tunity of personal contact with the
islanders. He held a theory that some'
of the missing ships of Mendana’s squad-
ron foundered along the top of the Bar-
rier Reef, where there are some hun-
dreds of known wrecks, and he cited the
discovery of Spanish coins and relics
among the Murray islanders, the pres-
ence of Latin words in their language,
and rock drawings as well as native
legend in support of it. He was scoffed
at by one distinguished scientist for de-
daring that tobacco was known to the
islanders and the people of Papua before
it was introduced by white men, yet
there are old hands who hold that he
was right.

“Hamer”: With the protective wiring
of Sydney Harbor Bridge, the Gap has
returned to favor as a suicide resort;
there have been five recent fatalities there.
Yet, while the Bridge-suicide was invari-
ably featured in the dailies, the per-
son who slips into eternity by the Gap
“Hey, sh-shover—get rid o’ the old tabby, an’ take me an’ the sh-sheilah t’
Darlinghurst. I’ll give y’ shevenpence a mile.”
route seldom gets more than a brief para-
graph. I suppose the idea is that there
is a certain amount of human respon-
sibility for the deaths of those who go
over from the work of man’s hands,
whereas the Gap suicide-rate can be
comfortably laid upon the shoulders of
the Deity. Yet there was something to
be said for the Bridge, if felo de se had
been decided on. Those who hurled
themselves over it died quickly, and,
as far as can be judged, with little pain,
and there was a minimum of difficulty in
collecting the remains. At the Gap, on
the other hand, the victims are often
horribly injured on the rocks before they
die, and the lives of men who don’t
want to die are risked in the invariably
hazardous work of recovering the bodies.

“Chev.”: The discovery by a bushman
of a brass rod in the dense forest near
Healesville (Vic.) has revived interest in
the mystery of the Southern Cloud. There
were scores of vivid accounts by eye-
witnesses of that disaster. A farmer
saw the aircraft plunge into the sea near
Geelong; it passed low over several
houses in Brighton ; it was witnessed in
difficulties at Wilson’s Promontory;
in several places in the ranges as far
back as Kosciusko people heard the
crash, saw the flames or actually watched
the machine descending. Some of the
most circumstantial evidence came from
the district where the present find was
made, and by a coincidence the dis-
coverer was one of those who saw a
sudden flare in the locality on the after-
noon in question. He led several search
parties into the almost inaccessible area,
and has never ceased to keep his eyes
open. There is a deep ravine in the
vicinity where a whole covey of aero-
planes could be hidden.

“Warbeck”: Many explorers and
scientists whose opinions cannot be
lightly disregarded have doubted whether
Peary ever reached the North Pole in
1909 ; but I had a vague idea that his
achievement was an article of faith with
all good Americans —Uncle Sam seldom
jumps on his own idols. An article in
the “Mercury” knocks my illusion end-
ways ; I doubt whether any European
paper has ever published a more crushing
indictment of the deceased admiral. “The
crowning record of his life is almost
surely a falsehood,” pronounces the
writer; “an unseemly myth, the record
of which is a disgrace to. the United
States.” And there is more about “the
national shame of honoring so highly a
man whose achievement is not authen-
ticated.” The charges are supported by
some weighty arguments directed to
showing that no man could possibly have
covered the distance Peary claimed to
have covered in his final dash for the
Pole, that much of the evidence he pro-
duced was faked, that none of it was ever
properly investigated. In other words,
that Peary was an impostor, if a less
barefaced and more successful one than
Dr. Cook.

“Con Tango”: Thirty or forty years
ago I read a complaint about the unneces-
sarily large size of cheque-books and
cheque-forms and a demand as to why
on earth they couldn’t be made smaller.
But the banks move slowly, and quite
possibly the people who do the most
business with them prefer the generous
allowance of paper hallowed by long
tradition. Until the other day I never
saw a cheque-book less than 11 inches
long and 3| inches deep ; I was agree-
ably astonished when I was furnished
with one inches by 3 inches, upon
which a request to pay a million or any
other sum will carry just as far. Inciden-
tally, whence came the old bush phrase
“a cheque as big as a blanket”? Did some
of the big pastoral firms in the earlier
days specialise in huge cheque-forms?
* * * *
“Quot”: Professor Elkin (B. 3/10/’34)
complains that to characterise as “guess-
work”. his statement that there were
300,000 aborigines in 1788 is “neither
courteous nor correct.” His, one learns,
is a careful estimate, made a few years
ago from all available sources, though
what the sources are he doesn’t specify.
Previous writers on the subject were
more diffident. W. R. Smith, con-
tributor of several articles on the
aboriginals to the “Australian Ency-
clopaedia” (1925), after discussing the
divergent opinions of various observers,
beginning with Grey and Eyre—both
decided that accurate computation was
impossible—remarks that modern writers
mostly put the figure at about 150,000,
but that there is no means of proving or
disproving the correctness of the esti-
mate. “All that can be said is that it is a
guess.” And so, obviously, is any other
figure.
* * * : '.=
“Kinnis”: These novelists —of both
sexes —who take station life for their
theme almost invariably give me a pain.
That they know nothing about it, or, at
the most, have only a superficial know-
ledge, doesn’t deter them in the least. A
favorite delusion of theirs is that on every
station there is only one man who does
not know his job, and whose position
could be more capably filled by any
other man —and that incompetent is
always the manager. The day has gone
when they used to run thousands of
cattle and horses and proportionate
numbers of sheep on vast areas of a
thousand acres. There is a new school
which tries to be scientific, and which
is merely silly in the process. For the
benefit of those who don’t know, and
who may wish to write a book on the
subject, let me say that the vast majority
of managers —99 of every 100 —do not
ride pony hacks and merely supervise.
They not only direct the men under
them but give them a lead in all
work which their age permits them
to do. As a world traveller once
remarked to me: “I know no so-
called leisured class in positions of
authority which works so hard „as the
managers of Queensland stations.’
COOK’S COTTAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The controversy over Cook’s cottage has been
revived in Yorkshire. The Mayor of Great Ayton
considers it doubtful if James Cook ever saw the
place, and says that the Victorian Government has
been sold a pup.”
Could you but speak, O venerable cot
From Yorkshire moors and moorings torn
away
And reconstructed, floor to chimney pot,
To help to make a Melbourne holiday,
You might have something pertinent to say.
Into a hallowed shrine you'll doubtless grow
And draw from visitors a steady income,
But while you’re furnishing a goodly show
'Tis strange to think that none will ever know
Whether or not you’re dinkum.
Cook’s cottage, true. Nathless those ivied walls
And that rough roof, your purchasers agree,
Never re-echoed to the infant squalls
Or heard the whistles and the boyish calls
Of that illustrious celebrity.
’Tis but the old birds’ roost, we’re all aware,
They’ve dragged from Yorkshire to embellish
Aussie;
And the rude fathers of the place declare
As rude a doubt that James was ever there,
Which makes one wonder: Was he?
You may not tell us—and it seems a shame —
Exotic crib, transplanted wickiup,
If any memory clings about your frame
Of Cook, or if these Tykes can fairly claim
Guileless Victoria was sold a pup.
To Georgian days could you but take us back,
Rending aside the interposing curtain,
You’d earn some beaming smiles or scowls as
black
Whichever way you ruled, historic shack!
That much at least is certain.
Ah! unpretentious joint, could you but speak
You’d give us something over which to
think.
You, and you only, ultra-quaint antique,
Possess the knowledge that we vainly seek.
(1 almost thought 1 saw a window wink.)
Long may you last, O domicile obscure!
And, since to reminiscence none may win you,
Bethink, for all your sentimental lure,
There’s nobody at all can say for sure
That Cook was ever in you.

POLITICAL POINTS
Queensland Labor allows that Forgan
Smith is sincere, and all that; but it
is beginning to mutter that lots of the
boys have forgotten more than he will
ever learn about the art of electioneering.
Just' when it was clear that their Senate
candidates would have to depend on
Douglas Credit preferences, Foggy
attacked Douglas, saying his scheme for
Scotland would cut wages 25 p.c. Then,
unable to get into his office for Civil
servants thronging out before 5 p.m., the
Premier issued a minute to the effect that
they would have to observe the proper
“working” hours. This with the early
birds organised in a Trades Hall union,
and with a State election due in a few
months!
Westralian Labor greeted the Duke
with the glad news that its 1933-34 deficit
was a mere £788,000. By spending
£220,000 more and collecting another
£360,000, it hopes to prune the hardy
perennial materially this year—provided
King, Lords and Commons don’t grant
secession too hurriedly and thus rob the
State of the £600,000 it gets from the
Commonwealth as a present.
Awed at its own boldness, Westralian
Labor is to tax gold-mining profits, and
aims at getting £BO,OOO in a year. By
the look of things, Wiluna will before
long be making that much in a month,
and so will Lake View and Star.
Trade-union figures for August show
the lowest percentage of unemployed
since May, 1930 ; the rate has declined
from 30 p.c. in May, 1932, to 20.4 p.c.
But there is still a long way to go.
Premier Ogilvie’s majority in Tas.
Assembly is so slender that either Becker
(Ind. Lab.) or Carruthers (Douglas
Credit) could place the Government in a
minority. But he has been encouraged
by the Fed. Lab. victories in the Reps.,
and he met an Opposition move for re-
duction of land tax with the declaration
lhat defeat on any hostile motion of the
sort would be followed by an appeal to
the electors. Study of the Senate figures
suggests that the young gentleman had
better not. rush it.
“Parkhill, I s’pose, ’ll be Minister of
Defence. Our best organiser, sir.”
“A regular Carnot, what?”
Don’t know about that, but he organ-
ised the election victories of 1917
and 1919.”
Lyons promised in his policy speech
lo explore the possibilities of making
motherhood less hazardous, and a depu-
tation of A.W.N.L. matrons intends
going from Launceston to Canberra to
keep him up to it. In Australia last year
571 mothers died in childbirth. Though
our infantile death-rate is one of the
lowest in the world (only Maoriland’s
beats it), our maternal death-rate is one
of the highest—s.s7 per 1000, the Laun-
ceston ladies say, compared with 4.1 in
England, 3.1 in Denmark and 3.0 in
Sweden.
About the most brazen exhibition of
nerve seen for a long time was Russia’s
request to the Bank of England for a
loan of £50,000,000 —time, 50 years; in-
terest, 3 p.c. Apart from the fact that
Russia has repudiated debts to Britons
“But ve’re comrades, now, ain’d id?”
totalling £1,058,973,000 plus interest
since 1918, it is offering bonds to the
world at 7 p.c.
Commonwealth elections will have to
be speeded up somehow. It is preposter-
ous that the country should have to wait
two or three weeks for the votes to be
counted in an electorate like Adelaide,
and it is rough on highly-strung candi-
dates withal: there have been cases in
which the strain of waiting for weeks to
learn their fate has worried them almost
into their coffins. The delays are attri-
butable to the fool-provision which per-
mits an elector who doesn’t think he will
be in his subdivision or doesn’t want to
be to vote at any polling place in the
State. It encourages laziness, and there
is no real check on fraud.
While tote revenue is steadily rising
in Victoria, where there are s.o. and
place machines with a ss. unit in the
grandstand, there has been a stunning
fall in N.S.W. Government claims that
it picked up a bit last year, but at
£110,500 it was £10,500 less than Lang
collected in his wildest year and £83,300
less than in 1928-29. Government regards
the tote merely as a taxing machine (it
takes 9 p.c.), and doesn’t care a dump for
what the public wants. The public wants
ss. w'in, place and doubles machines, and
the clubs are willing to supply the goods,
but the Government won’t let them.
Some of the Perth suburbs are in the
Commonwealth electorate of Swan—
otherwise fruit-growing and farming—
and they all have State Labor members.
These gentlemen could scarcely believe
their eyes when they read the district
returns. Victoria Park, which has been
Labor for many years, gave a majority
of 1000 to the septuagenarian Gregory.
South Perth was upwards of 2 to 1 for
the old gentleman. As part of Canning,
it used to return Clydesdale, now a Labor
M.L.C. and chairman of the Govern-
ment Lotteries Commission ; it was for
Clydesdale that the Government had the
Constitution altered so that he might
continue to hold two jobs. The turnover
of votes is ascribed to resentment at
this action and at Labor truckling to the
secessionists.
Tasmania has provided the amazing
spectacle of Lyons men losing three of
the five U.A.P. seats in the House of
Reps, while Nationalist Senators Hayes,
Hays and Grant were re-elected with
substantial majorities. Hayes has been
in the Senate since 1923, and had been
an opponent of Lyons in the Tas. Par-
liament for 10 years ; Hays was an anti-
Lyons Assemblyman for 11 years, 1911-
22, and has been a Senator since. Clearly
Lyons was no asset to his new party in
his own State—a liability rather. But,
no doubt, Libs., Nats, and Yaps, will
go on cherishing their simple belief that
Labor politicians who condescend to join
(and lead) them from time' to time bring
over lots of Labor votes.
Ordered to subscribe 10,000 shillings
to Lang’s Federal “fighting” fund, the
N.S.W. Miners’ Federation weighed in
with 36 and then helped the U.A.P. to
return old Watkins for Newcastle. Now
it has refused a renewal of their nomi-
nations to two Lang Assemblymen, Con-
nolly and Brennan. The Lang organisa-
tion owes the coalies £3OOO-odd, and said
it couldn’t pay, though it wasted at least
twice as much on dull radio talks by
the Boss.
The election figures suggest that Dein
would have held Lang (N.S.W.) for the
U.A.P. had he contested it again—unless
he neglects his duties, a sitting member
invariably gets a bit of a personal fol-
lowing—and, similarly, that Gibson could
have averted the loss of Corangamite
(Victoria) to the C.P. Each has been re-
warded for leaving his party in the lurch ;
rewarded with a seat in the Senate for
six years. It doesn’t seem right.
Vic. Senator Bob Elliott wound up
with 164,550 No. 1 votes, raised by
preferences to 188,921. No greater num-
ber has ever been given to an Australian
standing alone, but instead of regarding
it as a compliment Bob is depressed. At
the declaration of the poll he spoke bit-
terly of “this damnable game of party
politics,” and said he would play it no
m'ore —“I will never again contest a
Senate election.” Candidates who lost
their deposits are less dispirited.
There’s no consistency in these seces-
sionists. The late Lovekin, of Perth
“Daily News,” sold his newspaper to a
Melbourne group and invested the pro-
ceeds in British Consols. MacCallum
Smith, M.L.A., as a director of West-
ralia’s only private bank, helped to dis-
pose of it to the Bank of N.S.W. Now
“Losh, what a struggle it was to get
aboord without betraying ma secret!
Mon, Ah’m sellin’ ma secesh paper
to the anti-secessionists — cur-r-se
them!”
he has placed his secesh newspaper, the
“Sunday Times,” under offer to the same
Melbourne group that bought the “D.N.”
and the “West Australian.” The news was
broken to his staff (two of whom stood as
secesh candidates for the Senate) the day
after McSmith set out for London “to
lay the Case for Secession at the foot of
the throne.”
In the struggle for State Labor nomi-
nations, Tom Keegan, M.L.A., has gone
under in Glebe. Dean of the Caucus in
length of service—he entered the House
just 24 years ago, though he was out for
20 months, 1920-21 —he was in Lang’s
luckless second Ministry. That improvisa-
tion failed to last five months, and re-
turned to the Opposition benches with-
out Stokes, its Minister of Agriculture ;
since then Lysaght, Cruickshank and
Stuart-Roberston have died ; Willis has
been expelled ; Gosling has lost his seat,
and now Keegan is to lose his.
“Mr. Main, the N.S.W. Minister of Agricul-
ture, stated that the grasshopper invasion had
not yet reached the stage where Government
money was needed to combat it.”
“The ’hoppers are in the crops! They’re
threatening thirty-two million acres
in New South alone.”
“My dear chap, this is Cup-time. Call
again when it’s over.”
The defeat of all the Labor candidates
for the Senate has drawn an expression
of sympathy from Lyons, who suggests
that the system should be changed
somehow. None of this agitation was
noticed when his old party won all the
seats contested in 1910 or when (as hap-
pened for many years) the other side was
without Senate representation in Queens-
land and Westralia. McNamara, the
Vic. A.L.P. secretary, urges proportional
representation for the Senate. Let him
have it if he wants it; but it would
mean that his crowd would have no
chance of getting a majority this side
of 1941.
John Spence, the N.S.W. Auditor-
General, digs up many interesting facts
of which the taxpayers have not been
informed. One detailed in his report for
1933-34 is that the Stevens Government
set up John Garlick, “formerly chair-
man of the Main Roads Board,” in an
office at £4 a day—
To assist in the preparation of infor-
mation for use at a conference of Pre-
miers to consider the question of the
amendment of the Constitution of Aus-
tralia.
Mr. Garlick may know a lot about roads,
but he is no recognised authority on the
Commonwealth Constitution. In “fees
and office expenses” the appointment
cost £1039 7s. Bd. It was sheer waste ;
amendment of the Constitution was
scarcely mentioned at the conference of
Premiers.
From “Reg V.”:
The plight of Lamaro, who resigned his
Leichhardt seat to contest a Commonwealth
electorate in Lang’s interest and can’t get it
back, is a reminder that returned-soldier mem-
bers have nothing to thank Lang for. There
were two, Dunn and Cann, in his first Ministry
(1925-27); he kicked them both out, and there
was no Digger in the second combination of
13. Dunn was in the third, but in 18 months
or so the association cost him a seat he had
held since 1910. It was fatal also to Mc-
Dicken, who had already fallen under the
Boss’s displeasure. And Hughie Connell,
D. 5.0., M.C., was carefully excluded from
office in Lang’s time, though head and shoulders
above most of Lang’s Ministers. Lang has
always preferred flatterers, and they didn’t
teach the art of flattery in the A.I.F.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Westralian Premier Collier is ill, and
Alick McCallum, the Minister of Works,
met the Duke as temporary head of the
Government. But Shapcott, the Pre-
mier’s secretary (“Snapshot” to his
critics), was in charge of the State ar-
rangements for the King’s son’s visit.
Like other Australian Premiers’ secre-
taries, “Snapshot” sometimes acts for the
Government as an extra Minister. It is
a convenient arrangement for both,
especially useful to the Government
when a scapegoat is needed. “Snapshot”
is a tall, stoutish, middle-aged, slow-
speaking deep-thinker, used to having
political trouble laid on his broad shoul-
ders and impervious to newspaper
railing.
Perth has a comfortable old Govern-
ment House divinely situated on the
north bank of the beautiful bay-like
Swan, and the Duke must have felt at
home there. Jimmy Mitchell, the present
tenant, would make anyone feel at home
if he had to offer hospitality in a tent in
the Stony Desert. A banker by profes-
sion, and then a shrewd and far-sighted
farmer, he is too good-hearted to be a
success at managing other people’s
affairs, but not even the group-settlement
business could make Westralians think
unkindly of him. At the most ceremoni-
ous moment of the affair on Fremantle
wharf, when the Duke and his staff were
standing at the salute, a camera caught
the Lieut.-Gov. with a hand in his pocket.
Jimmy is like that.

theatre have been rejected by the Government.
George D. Meudell, from Melbourne:
Let me enter the lists with the claim that I
am The Bulletin’s oldest inhabitant. My
first par.—written in answer to a personal re-
quest from Archibald—appeared in the second
number; and I began to contribute regularly in
1880. So lam well into my fifth decade, beating
D. H. Souter (B. 3/10/’34) by a decade and
a half. This connection with the only pure
Australian journal in spirit and deed is my
proudest possession.
Kingsford Smith is out of the Vic.
centenary race —he has decided that he
can’t get to the starting-point in time to
do justice to himself and his new
machine. As a substitute he is going to try
to fly from Sydney to San Francisco in
five days. Ulm, for his part, is planning
to knock chunks off the time from San
Francisco to Sydney. It will be rather
like an aerial variety of prisoners’ base.

the Royal Australasian College of Sur-
geons has replaced the fine old Girls’
High School in Spring-street, Melbourne,
will be opened in March by Sir Holburt
Waring, president of the parent institu-
tion in England. Sir Holburt is author
of “Surgical Diseases of the Liver and
Bladder” and several other noteworthy
scientific publications.
E. A. Callanan, the new head of
Vacuum Oil in Australia —he succeeds
H. C. Cornforth, who has held the job
for 33 years—comes from the pleasant
Massachusetts town of Springfield, fam-
ous for its arsenal and for the fact that
it was once burned by Indians. The Cal-
lanan family have been farmers for gen-
erations, but, the war taking the young
man into the air force, he joined General
Motors at the Armistice, quickly became
European sales manager and then gen-
eral export sales manager before he
transferred to Vacuum. He is a keen
horseman and golfer.
Bruce Dellit, whose plans for a
£250,000 theatre and accessories have
been rejected by
the Sydney Gov-
ernment, is only
35. Beginning as
a junior clerk in
the Water Board
office, he set out
to become an
architect by engag-
ing in night studies
at the “Tech.”
under Byera Had-
ley and at the Uni-
versity under Leslie
Wilkinson. At 20
he became chief
draftsman on the
design of Brisbane
Town Hall. Re-
turning to Sydney
after two years in
Brisbane, he joined
an old architectural
firm for which he
designed Scottish
House, Bridge-
street; Marcus
Clark’s building in
Central - square;
the “Evening
News” structure
near Hyde Park,
and Dalge t y ’ s
offices at Newcastle.
Since 1928 he has
been in private
practice; to that
period belong his
designs for Aus-
tralia House, Wyn-
yard-square; Kyle
House; the Aus-
tralia Hotel ball-
room, dining-room and lounge; the
Kinsela chapel; the Anzac Memorial
and the Liberty Theatre.
Ted Durrington, of Lightning Ridge
(N.S.W.), has put the shutters up at 82.
When he opened his store the opalfield
was only a few months old —it consisted,
indeed, of half a dozen tents. Many
gougers who struck it lucky owed their
ability to hang on to Ted. He had a
weakness for bush bards, and not a few
swallowed pints at his expense.
Charles Booth Hayes, who has pulled
his last tooth in Melbourne, was the
oldest practising dentist in the city. He
came from Canada to Sydney in 1886,
soothed aching jaws in Ballarat in
later years and settled finally by the
Yarra in 1911. He was 79 at the finish.
Clive Gaunt has returned from Burma,
where he was Government advocate for
20 years, to live at Sandringham (Vic.).
He is a member of a distinguished Aus-
tralian family—a son of Judge Gaunt,
formerly of the Vic. County Court,
and brother of Admiral Ernest Gaunt,
Vice-Admiral Guy Gaunt —both retired
from the Royal Navy with knighthoods—
and Mary Gaunt, the novelist.
Rear-admiral and
son of a rear-
admiral, F. Burges-
Watson, in com-
mand of the M.L.
squadron, is cele-
brating the jubilee
of his birth by a
visit to his mother’s
native town of
Sydney she was
Marie Therese
Fischer. The rear-
admiral has had a
varied naval experi-
ence which included
jobs on the royal
yacht and in the
Admiralty, where
for two years he
was Naval Assis-
tant to the Second
Sea Lord. His last
address before he
came south was
c/o H.M.S. Nel-
son, of which he
was flag - captain
(she and the Rod-
ney are the only
two battleships in
the Navy that carry
16in. guns); his
present one is c/o
H.M.S. Diomede.
When in England
he lives in the Isle
of Wight, is a member of the
Marlborough (King Edward’s favorite
club), and wherever he may be is ac-
counted one of the best raconteurs any
navy has produced since Noah lectured
on the voyage of the Ark.
A. H. Stuart, g.m. of the “S. M.
Herald,” who will lead the Australian
delegation to the Empire press confer-
ence in South Africa in January, is an
infant among Granny’s seniors. A
Scotsman born in England (at Louth,
Lines.), and “Sandy” to troops of
friends, he had his first Australian experi-
ence on the Lismore (N.S.W.) “Star.” In
1917 he joined the “5.M.H.,” was
rightly picked by W. G. Conley
as a brilliant youngster and suc-
ceeded rapidly to a sub-editorship, the
London managership and the assis-
tant general managership. Last year he
was appointed g.m.—at 41. He has in-
troduced a number of innovations, but
the air of bustle about the marble-halls
which he controls has not extended to
his own quarters. He maintains the age-
old tradition that any visitor may walk
through the open door of the g.m.’s
room without prior announcement.
Macartney Abbott,, who will go into
the Senate next year with Dein and Cour-
tenay, is a native of Murrurundi (N.S.W.),
an old boy of The King’s School, Parra-
matta, and a solicitor and grazier. He
represented the Upper Hunter in Mac-
quarie-street for several years, but an-
nounced that he would resign if conscrip-
tion was not carried at the second refer-
endum. He was as good as his word,
and has been out of politics since.
Abbott, a good speaker with a vigorous
personality, is the second son of the late
J. P. Abbott, and J. H. M. Abbott, who
writes Bulletin stories, is an elder
brother.
Friend and protector of all with shat-
tered nerves and hurt minds was Dr.
Chisholm Ross, who died in Sydney at
the week-end. Born in Inverell (N.S.W.),
one of 10 children, he went to The King’s
School at Parramatta and took his medi-
cal degrees at Edinburgh University;
then for upwards of half a century he
was engaged—with infinite patience and
rare skill —in the treatment of neuras-
thenic and mental cases. Gladesville,
Kenmore and Callan Park knew him as
superintendent; Sydney Uni. as Profes-
sor of Psychology; Macquarie-street as
a famous and beloved identity. Aus-
tralia had no greater psychiatrist and no
kindlier man than Dr. Chisholm Ross.

TRUCK TYRES

THIS GRUELLING TEST
PROVES
BARNET GLASS
It Duplicates the Punish-
ment that Modern Roads
and Heavy Loads Impose
The amazing capacity of Barnet Glass Truck Tyres for extra
mileage and unfailing service is proved by two gruelling tests.
First* by this machine, which duplicates the actual working
conditions of high speeds, capacity loading and rough roads.
Secondly, on heavily-laden Test Trucks, which operate continu-
ously over thousands of miles ot typical Australian highways.
These tests also prove that in Barnet Glass I ruck the
main cause of tyre destruction generated heat —is minimised.
Any tendency to heat is reduced by a scientific balance between the
stretch of rubber and cords—cords ol long staple cotton ot high
tensile strength, effectively insulated by a coating ot heat-
resisting compounded rubber. All these features, combined wit
a deep-cut tread which grips and holds— enable Truck owmers to
reduce overheads and Bus owners to keep running to schedule.
Apply your own test! Fit Barnet Glass all round.

*lncludes £138,301 paid on old Perdriau co.’s
shares.
Tyres now account for approximately
one half of the co.’s turnover, and rubber
footwear for most of the other half, which
includes practically every remaining de-
scription of rubber goods. Half a dozen
years ago, when the Perdriau business was
welded into the organisation and the
550,000 ords. in Barnet Glass were
bought at 325. apiece, it looked as if
the big combination (the English Dunlop
Co. is also interested, having bought half
a million ords. at 255. each before the
merger) might keep steady on the 10 p.c.
mark. But the fall in turnover out-
stripped savings in the buying, manufac-
turing and marketing sections, and
there is £930,000 of 10 p.c. pref.
money in front of the ords., whose div.
dropped to 2\ p.c. in 1931. Despite the
difficulties of the following year, when
the'tyre trade reached its lowest point
and the price of raw rubber continued
to fall, net earnings started on the up-
grade, and have continued to climb since,
thanks to the management’s tight hold
upon exes., it's success in the manufac-
ture of new lines (these include elastic
webbing, golf balls and latex upholstery :
the latex plant had to be doubled during
the last term), and the improvement in
trade generally.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, the Barnet Glass Co.
paid 5 p.c., compared with 4,3, 5, 6 and
10 p.c. back to 1929 ; the number of
motor vehicles on the road in Australia
increased by 28,112, reaching 544,336 :
imports of chassis and parts amounted to
£2,921,190 as against £1,423,538 and
£467,564 for the two preceding terms.
Also, further cuts were made in the price
charged for tyres, while the cost of raw
rubber nearly doubled, and “large sums”
were spent out of earnings on extensions
and improvements to plant; equally
large sums were written off for depre-
ciation, etc., the chairman says. In other
words, every penny was not put on the
table. Visibly gross earnings (£862,826)
were £3,822 better, while exes. (£574,897)
were pulled back £42,188, making the
net improvement £46,010. After deduct-
ing pref. requirements, enough remained
to show 5.1 p.c. on the £3,765,655 of ord.
capital as against 3.9, 3, 2.1, 6 and 12.1
p.c. back to 1929, and the ord. div. was
lifted from 4 p.c. to 5 p.c.
As for the current term, business to
date shows continued improvement, and
when the books closed the co. was carry-
ing large stocks of crude rubber bought
much below present prices.
The ords. at 19s. 3d. return 5.2 p.c.
on a 5 p.c. div. basis, and the prefs. at
355. 6d. yield 5.6 p.c. The net tangible
cover is £5 4s. prefs. and 20s. 9d. ords.
There was marked improvement in the
already comfortable financial position:

Broadly, the function of the retailer is
that of buying agent for the community
he serves. His success or otherwise de-
pends largely upon whether he buys the
right type of goods at the right price,
and upon whether the women like the
store. David Jones has been fortunate
in both respects. Net earnings, which
had fallen nearly 58 p.c. in two years,
reached their nadir in 1931, when the
ord. div. (it used to be a steady 10
p.c.) dropped to 4 p.c. Reduced turn-
over (due to lighter spending and fallen
prices), stocks and overhead were the
chief troubles. The management’s suc-
cess in grappling with its problems, the
Government’s policy of cut and spend
—taxation has been reduced and the out-
lay on public works increased —the
growth of employment and general eco-
nomic recovery are all reflected in the
quick advance of the co.’s figures over
the last three years.
For the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, net earnings spring
£15,769, reaching £109,163, the second-
highest figure since the war. It was
enough to pay the pref. divs. (together
£27,750) and then show 13.5 p.c, on the
£600,000 of ord. capital as against 10.9,
8.7, 3.7, 7.6, 15.1, 11.8, 16 and 17.1 p.c.
back to 1926. The div. was lifted a
couple of points, raising it to 10 p.c.
again, and £21,413 was ploughed in.
Over the last three years the market,
which now sees no cloud in the co.’s
sky, has lengthened its bid for the 6 p.c.
first prefs. from 15s. to 275. 9d., for the
7\ p.c. seconds from 16s. 6d. to 30s. 6d.,
and for the ords. from 12s, to 425. 9d.,
which is the highest point they have ever
reached. At the higher figures the re-
turns at last year’s rates of distribution
are 4.3 p.c. firsts, 4.7 p.c. seconds and
4.6 p.c. ords. The net tangible backing
is £9 9s. sd. firsts, £5 Is. Bd. seconds and
345. ords.

balances increased by £53,155, stocks
were £33,807 lighter, and £43,110 was
added to the floating debt. On fixed
assets, which represent 59.6 p.c. of the
balance-sheet total, £36,758 more was
written off than was spent. It all sug-
gests a very lively turnover. The im-
provement in the more or less liquid

£56,296. The old George-street premises,
where the co. continues to trade in men’s

•Half-year.
This is the yarn-spinning, worsted and
woollen section of the A.K.M.-Yarra
Falls group, Australia’s biggest textile
enterprise, whose ramifications extend
into all sections of the trade. In ’33 the
co.’s own mills, at Abbotsford (Vic.),
had to work overtime to keep abreast of
demand.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, business was “well main-
tained,” and the return from the Globe
Worsted Mills, Sydney, in which the co.
holds 400,000 shares —75,000 of them
were taken during the last term —was
“very satisfactory.” Other holdings in-
clude 50,000 shares in A.K.M., the knit-
ting section, which has lifted its div. from
5 p.c. to p.c.; 35,500 shares in Aus-
tral Silk and Cotton, which paid an in-
terim 1 2-3 p.c. as against 24 p.c. for
the full preceding year; 30,000 in Julius
Kayser (Aus.), the hosiery offshoot,
whose sales are on the increase, and a
small holding in Rayon Pty., which turns
out lingerie.
After £33,238 more had been written
off than was spent on freeholds and
plant, and £20,000 had dropped from
somewhere into a special reserve (now
£40,000) against possible losses from
fluctuations in the price of wool, etc.,
the year’s gross earnings from all sources
(£143,494) dropped £5064. Including an
unspecified provision for taxation, ad-
ministrative charges, etc. (£38,215), were
£11,649 lighter, leaving the net result at
11.7 p.c. on capital as against 10.9, 7.4,
5.7, 8.8 and 12.6 p.c. back to 1929. The
div. was lifted'a point, raising it to 10
p.c. again.
Though competition is aggressive, and
the price of wool has fallen, the co. has
an excellent trade organisation, and is
well equipped financially. For these and
other reasons, including the growth of
employment, the market doesn’t expect
the 10 p.c. div. to be interfered with
during the current term. It therefore
prices the pound shares at 425. as against
355. a year ago, the return at the higher
figure being 4.7 p.c. on the basis of last
year’s distribution. The cover is 255. lOd.
in net tangibles.
Here is the position looked at from
another angle:

Including stocks (up £45,834), the most
vulnerable point in the co.’s armor, the
more or less liquid surplus (£353,756)
was £37,345 lighter than at the previous
balance. This was due to a growth of
£75,000-odd in the shares in other cos.,
which are in at cost.

This 24-year-old, which runs a chain of
shops and has strong connections among
suburban retailers, is Sydney’s biggest
vendor of sporting goods, tobacco and
haircuts. For the first dozen years it
paid a steady 10 p.c., sweetened with
£40,625 of bonus scrip. Then it went
into debt to buy property in Haymarket.
to which the ’buses were bringing a lot
of people. But the proposed realignment
of George-street prevented the co.
making the best use of its freehold,
price-cutting became endemic, and earn-
ings have been irregular for more than
a decade, despite expansion of the busi-
ness.
Slump, price-cutting and withdrawal
of the ’buses have been the chief troubles
for the last three years. During the last
term, trade was a little better, and gross
earnings (£99,200) sprang £6140. Exes.
(£98,867, including £2727 for deprecia-
tion, shown as written off in the table)
were pulled back £3499, due mainly
to closure of the Brisbane branch, which
had become a drag. But the net result
(a profit of £333) was not good enough
to pay a div.
During the year the co.’s, premises ad-
joining its Haymarket depot were rebuilt
on the new alignment, the cost being met
out of compensation received from the
City Council. The position as balance-
sheet figures show it is as follows:
1919. 1930. 1933. 1934.

Book debts .. 21,861 60,081 64,697 71.903
Cash, etc. .. 6,371 602 950 1,002
To carry an extra £7206 of debtors’
balances and add £2587 to stocks (they
are a promiscuous lot), £9230 was tacked
on to the debt, of which £132,214 is
represented by mortgage. When the
books closed, liabilities exceeded more
or less liquids by £56,549, down £615
over the twelvemonth.
The new premises, partial restoration
of ’bus services, and elimination of price-
cutting in the tobacco trade since June
18 augur well for a better showing at

The All-Weather Driving Belt
CHROMOL
Waterproof
Cemented
When it is impossible to
avoid outdoor drives, or
to protect belting from
exposure to the weather
or unusual operating con-
ditions, it is then that
Chromol, the Super All-
Weather Driving Belting,
proves its sterling worth.
i-
u
Damp, steamy or dust-laden atmo-
spheres, scorching sun or drying
winds cannot lessen the efficiency of
Chromol Belting. Chromol is speci-
ally tanned to meet just such condi-
tions and is thoroughly waterproof
cemented, so that even immersion in
water cannot harm it.
Apart from these outstanding features,
however, the amazing gripping power
and pliability of Chromol Belting
make it particularly desirable where
drives are subject to sudden starting
shocks, heavy or variable loads, or
where high pulley ratios and angle or
cross drives are encountered.

Though more orders came in, the lot
was woefully short of plant capacity.
Most of the year’s profit came from in-
vestments outside the business. These
stood in the books at £101,721 at June
30. Gross earnings from all sources
(£14,119) were up £2086, and the net
result benefited by £1506 of the increase,
reaching 5.2 p.c. on capital compared
with 4, 3.6, 0.6, 9.4, 16.6 and 12.3 p.c.
back to 1928. The div, was lifted half
a point, raising it to 5 p.c.
Including two special bonuses, share-
holders averaged 13 p.c. for the decade
to the close of accounts in 1930. Mean-
while, the board took up the question
of the manufacture of Diesel engines with
the Government, which encouraged the
co. to proceed with the remodelling of
its plant. The alterations cost about
£40,000, which was written off out of
reserves. The idea behind the change-
over was to bridge the gap caused by
the restricted demand for locomotives
and sugar-mill equipment, which Jhad
been the backbone of the business for
over 20 years—mining machinery and
boilers had been the co.’s mainstay be-
fore that. But the Government failed to
give the co. adequate protection, and
because high-powered engines continue
to be admitted free the co. has been
compelled to suspend this class of work.
Exactly what the future holds for the
business it is difficult to say. The im-
mediate outlook has been brightened by
an order from the Queensland Govern-
ment for half a dozen locomotives. The
market sums up the risks by pricing the
pound shares at 18s. 6d., at which figure
the return is 5.4 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div.
basis. The net tangible cover is 265. Bd.

(£52,359, down £203) are mainly balances
owing on t.p. contracts. The more or
less liquid surplus (£158,651) was £2405
stronger than at the previous balance.
Australian Alloy Steel, formed in
Sydney by J. M. Deschamps about three
years ago, is now turning out wearing
parts for all industries as well as agricul-
tural spares, mainly ploughshares, made
under a new patent process. The co. is so
pleased with its prospects in all States that
it has decided to form a subsidiary to
handle and finance the sales side of the
business, thus leaving the parent free to
deal with problems of manufacture. The
pup, Australian Alloy Steel (Sales), Ltd.,
is a Canberra registration with a capital
of £15,000 in £1 shares.

Australian investors have long felt that
the London boards of some Anglo-Aus-
tralian mining ventures are too generous
—to themselves. The matter has now
been brought to a head by a joint pro-
test from the Stock Exchanges of Mel-
bourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and
Hobart against the proposed increase in
directors’ fees, etc., of Great Boulder
Prop. The co.’s headquarters are in
London, but the mine is at Kalgoorlie
(W.A.). Capital is £175,000 in 2s. shares.
In 1933 divs. totalled 37y p.c. as against
25 p.c. in 1932, and better is anticipated
owing to recent developments under-
ground and the erection of a new mill,
which is expected to save £48,000 p.a.
in costs alone. The directors (there are
three each in London and Adelaide and
one in W.A.) now propose that their
aggregate fees be raised from £l5OO p.a.
to £3750 p.a. (£5OO each plus an extra
£250 for the chairman), and that the
proportion of profits to be divided among
them be raised from £3OOO to £lO,OOO in
respect of any year. That is to say,
they are asking for an extra £9250 p.a.
(= 5.2 p.c. on capital), or £13,750 in all.
The Australian Stock Exchanges, which
look askance at payment of directors
by a percentage of profits, stress the fact
that at all times the technical staffs on
goldfields chiefly bear the responsibility
for earning profits, the recent increases
in which are due to influences over which
directorates have no control. It is there-
fore contended that they are not entitled
to special remuneration, and abandonment
of the present proposals is urged. To
this end, the co-operation of the London
Stock Exchange has also been sought.

In 700ft'. of driving and crosscutting
Cordinhap Hydraulic Gold Sluicing (Vic),
met with only one payable area, and
that was too small to warrant treatment
by sluicing. The co. is now prospecting
ground to the north, and has picked up
what it hopes to be a run of payable
values. The testing of the whole area,
including three-quarters of a mile of new
ground to the south, should be completed
in two or three months. The co. has
£234 in hand, £BB due in calls, and one
eye on another property.

Goldie Alluvials, N.L., is a Melbourne
float with a capital of £4OOO in £lO
shares, of which 250 are offered ; the
vendor takes 100 paids plus £250 cash.
The property covers about three miles of
the Goldie lead, near Kilmore (Vic.).
The southern end of this was formerly
worked over a width of 120 ft. with pay-
able results, until the miners lost ,the level
and abandoned the venture. The idea
now is to seek a site for a main shaft
further down the lead, and to test-bore
the show.
* * * *
Pyrenees Alluvials, having sold its area
at Avoca (Vic.) to an operating co., has
decided to wind up, and the contribs.
expect about 255. per share. The working
co., New Pyrenees Alluvial, is further
testing portion of the ground with a view
to dredging, and the deeper portion is
being bored for a shaft site from which
to work the leads.
* * * *
The Bird-in-Hand, Woodside (S.A.),
which has lowered the water in the main
shaft to 328 ft., expects to examine the
main gossan lodes in a couple of weeks.
To check values in other shoots, Hock-
ing’s shaft is being resunk, and a new
prospecting shaft is being put down. The
intention is to instal a 1500-ton-a-month
plant when enough of the right sort of
ore becomes visible.
* * * *
Dale L. Pitt, who has done good work
as g.m. of the Premier Co., Alaska, is
now on his way to Westralia to direct
developments at the Big Bell, Cue, in
which the Premier Co. and American
Smelting and Refining of New York are
jointly interested. A two years’ diamond-
drilling campaign has disclosed a large
low-grade but consistent ore-body about
80ft. wide and 900 ft. to 1000 ft. in length.
If Pitt considers prospects good enough
he will remain at the Big Bell for about
three years, and a 1000-ton-a-day mill is
to be erected. Meantime he will con-
tinue to manage all Premier operations.
* * * *
Triton (W.A.), in which Western Gold
and Gold Mines of Aus. are interested,
is concentrating on connecting its 1000 ft-
. north and south shafts by a main
level drive at a depth of 300 ft. After con-
nection has been made, heartening news
from winzing and shaft sinking from the
300 ft. to the 500 ft. levels is expected.
* * * *
Broken Hill Prop, has taken an option
over Herriman and Glover’s mine at
Misery Hill, Kalgoorlie (W.A.). The
show contains a lode formation of great
width, and a recent crushing at the Kal-
goorlie State battery averaged' 6|dwt.
The co. has also taken an option over
another property six miles north of
Kalgoorlie.

Lancefield expects its 10,000-ton plant
to be ready for the feed early next year.
Meanwhile, unwatering is the big job. It
will be the first large co. in W.A. to
commence treatment operations on an
£8 10s. per ounce gold basis. Results
will afford an idea of what can be done
in the way of reopening old mines under
new conditions.
# * * *
Southern Cross United (W.A.) is get-
ting on with diamond-drilling and the
erection of mining plant on Fraser’s ore
channel. There are three objectives ; one
is Fraser’s lode, 3000 ft. long, which was
a div* payer in the past. Appearances
are that the mine has a good chance of
becoming a winner.
* * * *
Golden West, of Kunanalling (W.A.),
a pup of New Venture, has treated 102
tons for an average of 24dwt. over the
plates. The sands assay has not been
received. The property includes the
Sadie and the Turn of the Tide, which
a local co. tried to launch over a year
ago.
* * * *
The Emu Co. has taken an option over
the Orion mine, Niagara (W.A.). Here
an -engineer reports ore assaying from
16dwt. to 50dwt., left by previous
owners. It is difficult to understand how
lode matter of that grade was missed.
* * * *
Norseman (W.A.) figures on obtaining
gold to the value of £20,000 monthly
from its new 5000-ton plant when com-
pleted ; and developments at No. 4 level
justify the estimate. But all levels at
the mine are not so good as No. 4.
* * * *
Goldfields Australian Development,
which had a fortnight’s free sampling
option over the First Hit at Menzies
(W.A.), has abandoned work, and the
vendors (Duckworth and Allen) may let
the show go to the Lady Shenton. The
property has been well opened up,
is equipped with £16,000 worth of
machinery, and the owners have taken
out 900 tons for 3000 oz. of gold.
* * * *
Mulline Development Syndicate, which
already has several irons in the fire, has
taken an option over B. Asher’s mine
at Kanowna (W.A.). Here Western
Mining Corp. has also taken up a large
area, including the White Feather North ;
the Kangaroo Co. is working the Last
Chance, and S. Kalgurli is drilling on
an extensive line of lode.
* * * *
On the advice of B. V. Barton, Ora
Banda has decided to proceed with de-
velopment on the Barton mine, Nulla-
gine (W.A.). The co. will crosscut to
intersect the parallel lines of lodes, and
at the same time sink prospecting shafts.
The work, which has been put in hand,
is not expected to cost more than £3OOO.
* * * *
Granite Development Co., which is
diamond drilling at Wiluna, reports core
assays from a quartz reef of 16gr. to
36gr. per ton. All gold-mining cos. are
not so candid.

The hunt for gold in Westralia has one
unsatisfactory feature. Hundreds of men
are prospecting on numerous sheep
stations, and some of the fossickers are
not giving sheepowners a fair spin. They
kill sheep for meat, and, of course,
usually pick the best animals. At times,
too, only a joint is taken from the car-
cass, the rest being left to rot and in-
crease the blowfly pest, the curse of
flockmasters. The business is serious,
and sheepowners are in bad tempers
over it.

“Tom Dossiter”: Does gold grow?
Possibly long contact with air and water
in abandoned mine-workings has a fer-
tilising effect. Many Westralian shows
sampled in the old 845.-per-oz. days re-
turned 2dwl. assay averages. There seem
to be no 2dwt. shows about now.
* * * =f>
Westralian Mines Department might
do worse than ban the name Phoenix as
applied to gold-mining leases. Already
there are three areas of that name, and
loss and inconvenience to consignors and
consignees of stores and mining requisites
have resulted.
A fuss is being made in Westralia
over the failure of certain gold-mining
ventures to come up to publicly-
announced expectations. Legislation to
strangle this sort of thing was urged
years ago, but nothing was done, and
probably nothing will be done now, as
the State Government is too busy grant-
ing indulgences to members needing
them to bother about protecting the
public.

During August Blackwater Mines,
Reefton (M.L.), crushed 4000 tons for
1897 fine ounces of gold, while Alex-
ander Mines, another Reefton show, got
2130 z. from 309 tons, plus 370 z. from
140 tons of sands. For 22 crushing days
Waihi won 4643 fine ounces of gold and
27,348 fine ounces of silver from 17,673
tons of ore. Waihi’s Royal lode, No. 6
intermediate level, is still showing high
values. At 53ft. the full width of the
lode is 4ft., assaying 41s. per ton.
BRIEF ANSWERS.

“Chu Chin Chow”
Present writer saw Oscar Asche’s ex-
travaganza in London in 1920 after it
had run for 1000 nights or so, and
thought it a very dull business. Even the
presence of a camel and a donkey on
the stage failed to convince him that the
actor-manager-producer-playwright-com-
poser and culinary expert had done more
than provide a series of theatrical illus-
trations after the Edmund Dulac man-
ner. The British manufacturers of the
film now at Melbourne Regent have bet-
tered Asche; in fact, they have knocked
that champion heavyweight clean out of
the ring.
It would be difficult to imagine a
better rendering of the barbaric quality
of an Arabian Nights’ Entertainment than
this staggering production. The love in-
terludes between Pearl Argyle and John
Garrick are as out of place in the Bag-
dad of the sixteenth century as an emu
in a treetop, and the exquisite fancy,
humor and pathos of the original are
replaced by George Robey’s comedy in
the role of Ali Baba, said comedy, how-
ever, being excellent. Moreover, there is
an aroma of Hollywood about the
ballets in which semi-naked damsels
spout streams of water from their fingers
and occiputs; still, screen Arabia is ex-
pected to be like Hollywood. Never-
theless, the highly-amusing episode of
Kassim Baba (Laurence Hanray) en-
deavoring to save his head by staging an
elaborate party before an unsmiling
Caliph, the glittering splendors of the
cave of the rascally Hassan (Fritz Kort-
ner) and the appropriate brutality of the
caravan raids combine to make a stir-
ring picture.
Our own Australian Malcolm Mc-
Eachern contributes his fine bass to
the part of Chu Chin Chow, and Anna
May Wong is his spy-girl Zahrat. The
final scene, in which the jars containing
the Forty Thieves are bowled down a
well and boiling soup, or something of
the sort, poured after them, is a triumph
for the camera, and the end of the robber
chief, who rolls down a staircase to the
Caliph’s feet clasping a gigantic gong, is
in keeping with the general elephantine
scale.
“Cup of Kindness”
Enmity between neighbors is the
theme of this Walls-Lynn comedy at the
Sydney State. Tutt (an elderly Tom
Walls) regards Ramsbotham (Robertson
Hare) with loathing and contempt. Rams-
botham considers Tutt an arrant snob.
Their wives share their feelings, but son
Charlie Tutt (Ralph Lynn) and daughter
Nat Pendleton in “Fugitive Lovers” at
Sydney St. James.
Betty Ramsbotham (Dorothy Hyson)
have different ideas. The entertainment
is up to the usual standard of the Walls-
Lynn-Hare team. Hare this time is the
best of the three, though his moments
of self-assertion are only occasional.
Claude Hulbert, the younger Tutt son,
is so convincing as a chinless nitwit that
it is difficult to believe that anyone could
look so silly without being mentally de-
Leslie Howard ( disguised) in “The Lady
Is Willing” at Sydney Liberty.
fective. The dialogue is clever and amus-
ing, although now and again a gag con-
siderably older than Ben Travers crops
up.
“The Merry Frinks”
This is described as a screaming farce,
but it runs away with itself and becomes
something very much better —a page of
family life with a fairy-tale ending.
Aline MacMahon is the mainstay—
though they don’t know it —of a thor-
oughly useless family. Her husband
(Hugh Herbert) is a sporting reporter
who drinks himself out bf one job after
another ; one son (Allan Jenkins) is an
unsuccessful lawyer and a rabid Com-
munist ; another, (Frankie Darrow) plays
truant , from school and cultivates bad
companions. Daughter (Joan Wheeler)
wants to sing to the microphone, though
she has no voice, and intends to elope
with a married man. Grandma (Helen
Lowell) lives with the family and is
always grumbling. Descends on this
family, prepared for a long stay, Uncle
Newt from Maoriland (Guy Kibbee).
He’s a sponger, but he sizes up the
situation, and when he dies suddenly it
is found he has left the long-suffering
wife “half a million dollars in the Bank
of New Zealand” on condition that she
cuts loose from the family. This she
does, and spends two months buying
frocks and frequenting beauty-parlors.
But, of course, she goes back —they’re
too much part of her life to cut out.
Aline MacMahon’s handling of the prin-
cipal role is well-nigh perfect, and the
others play up well. At the Capitol.
“Grand Canary”
This opens at Sydney Regent, and is
painfully slow-moving. Warner Baxter
is a famous surgeon who is considered
to have murdered three persons through
experimenting with a serum. They’d
have died anyway, and Baxter might
have saved them if he’d been allowed to
use the serum soon enough. Broken up,
he goes to the Canaries to lose himself,
falls in love, saves dozens of lives, in-
cluding a lady’s, and vindicates his
serum. He returns to England a hero,
and the lady he saved cables that she’ll
leave her husband to come to him.
Baxter is out of his depth. There are no
opportunities for the quiet romanticism
he specialises in, and his pipe doesn’t
appear. On the other hand, H. B. War-
ner, as a doctor-friend of Baxter’s, and
Roger Imhof, as Jimmy Corcoran, a
broxen-down fighter and student of Plato
“descended from the kings of Oireland,”
do splendidly. Photography, too, is good.
“Success at Any Price”
At Sydney Civic. The story of a push-
ing and ruthless young man’s rise from
humble surroundings to wealth and
power which makes few departures from
the beaten track. The junior Fairbanks
plays the climber, and presents a forceful
study of a type common in the Ameri-
can business world. He forges ahead by
hook or by crook, sacrificing friendships
in the process and undermining the man
who gave him his first big chance. The
ladies in the picture are Genevieve
Tobin, a social butterfly with scorched
wings married by the climber only to
lose her to one of his shady business asso-
ciates, and Colleen Moore, who watches
his progress with misgivings, endures his
indifference and, when the crash comes,
is at his side to comfort him. It has all
been done before a thousand times;
usually better.
“You Can’t Buy Everything”
The title, of course, refers to Lurv.
It takes Australian-born May Robson,
who occupies the central role, 30 years
to discover the truth of the hackneyed
maxim. Miss Robson portrays an old
lady who was jilted in her youth and
who was afterwards wedded to a scoun-
drel who robbed her of her inheritance.
Disillusioned, she becomes a manhater
and a miser, though she possesses a cer-
tain amount of selfish affection for her
son, represented in his later years by Wil-
liam Bakewell. She accumulates suffi-
cient cash to acquire control of a bank,
which is one of the first steps in her
plan to ruin the man who jilted her. This
she succeeds in doing. Meanwhile,
however, her son, who prefers newspaper-
work to banking, hitches up with the
daughter (Jean Parker) of her lifelong
enemy. Spurned by her son the old lady
presents a miserable picture until the
producer hits upon the idea of a sick-
bed reconciliation.
A maudlin effort, unworthy of Miss
Robson’s talents. At Sydney Liberty.
“The Lady Is Willing”
At Sydney Liberty. One of the puff-
merchants has described this brisk
English comedy as a “Continental cock-
Joan Crawford in "Sadie McKee” at
Sydney St. Janies.
tail of naughty intrigue,” and the censor
has tabbed it as being unsuitable for
general exhibition. Actually, you can
take your grandmother along with per-
fect safety. Its chief fault is that it tries
to be both slapstick and subtle, and
another is the poor support given Leslie
Howard, who takes the part of a French
private detective with gay abandon.
Howard is engaged by a banker, a
schoolmaster and a boxer to help them
recover some of the money they have
lost in a fraudulent enterprise. He makes
war on the man responsible for their
losses by kidnapping his beautiful wife
(Binnie Barnes) and holding her in a
rented castle for ransom. The lady is an
unwilling prisoner, and causes Howard
and his employers many anxious
moments. The husband also proves a
wily customer, and Howard works over-
time counteracting his moves. Follow-
ing Miss Barnes’s escape from (he castle
there is a succession of amusing situa-
tions leading up to a neat climax which
indicates that* she is prepared at a later
date to consider Howard as a suitable re-
placement for the husband she is going
to drop. The smart dialogue compen-
sates for a lot. -

It is well enough known.by now that
Florence Austral has the most beautiful
vocal instrument at present in active
commission on the planet. It is also well
known that in the sedate atmosphere of
the concert platform she can use this
instrument with extraordinary intelli-
gence, giving to everything she sings a
rare significance. On Friday, at the
Apollo, a packed and enthusiastic house

thing” at Sydney Liberty.
made the additional discovery that this
Australian could preserve all these
qualities while displaying every symptom
of insensate jealousy over the supposed
infidelity of Cavaradossi, the emotional
but very indifferent painter, in the
Church of Saint Andrea, Della Valle,
Rome ; while suppering with the abomin-
able Scarpia at the Farnese Palace in the
same imperial city; while listening to
her lover having his memory jogged by
the torturers and third-degree experts of
the Roman police department; while
being dragged about his apartment by the
police commissioner; even while using
his carving-knife for a purpose for which
its owner never intended it; and when
flinging herself carefully over the battle-
ments of the grim Castle of S. Angelo
(June, 1800; daynot specified). This is
a combination of two arts, only one of
which, and that the lesser, Scavizzi, the
previous greatest exponent of the role,
had in transcendent measure.
Browning Mummery, the Cavaradossi
of 1928, reappeared with the palette of
the painter, but marshalled his tones and
colors much better on his vocal canvas,
especially in the final aria, which, truth
to tell, is about the only melody in
Puccini’s piece which has artistic preten-
sions, the rest being mainly incidental
music set to the feverish activities of the
simple, direct and poignant story. The
Scarpia of Booth Hitchin was short of
the heart-shaking bellow which Rossi
Morelli gave him in the 1928 production,
but Norman Allin extracted the humor
from the part of the sacristan, and Octave
Dua’s police spy had no peer in Scarpia’s
criminal investigation department. The
dressing in the church scene in the first
act was splendiferous. Sub-conductor
Robert Ainsworth controlled his forces
admirably on the whole, but occasionally
turned the hose on a small blaze of vocal
artistry as if it were a major con-
flagration.
* * *
A quaint blend of “Mary,” “The
Patsy” and “The Belle of New York” is
“The Merry Malones,” doing big busi-
ness at Adelaide Royal, and due in Syd-
ney shortly. Dancing and dressing (with
a refreshing absence of undressing) are
strong points; the acting is another, and
there is one great waltz. Polly Walker,
from America, has a quiet style, and the
scenes of domestic affection with her
father rise far above usual musicomedy
standard, much of this being due to the
said parent, Florenz Ames, a fine
comedian of the restrained type. Robert
Capron is another new arrival, who looks
like Leslie Holland burlesquing Chamber-
lain. Shirley Dale and John Moore shine
out among the old friends in a big cast.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Encue”: I’d gone into Cardwell
(N.Q.) to get some tucker. Phil, my
mate, was left to look after the camp.
Returning next morning I was astounded
to find the door barricaded. Thumps
and bangs brought no response, but,
peering through a chink in the slab walls
of the hut, I saw Phil crawl cautiously
out from under the bed. His face was
white as chalk, and he held the camp
axe in one hand. “What’s the matter?”
I yelled through the crack. “Alligators!”
was the terse reply; “swamp’s full of
'em, and they nearly had me last night.
Listen!” Sure enough there was a
rushing and rustling from the near-by
swamp, followed by queer noises—half
barks, half grunts. I gingerly approached
the swamp to investigate. Visions of
14-foot ’gators chasing me into Cardwell
were dispersed by the sight of a mob of
wild pigs rooting about.
* * * *
“A.C.G.”: Hold one innocent butter-
fly responsible for the death of 52
of my chickens. The butterfly, in
particularly bright raiment, flew over the
chicken-run. Fifty-two thoughtless young
fowls fixed their eyes on the insect and
started in pursuit. In their eagerness
the birds pushed their heads through the
wire-netting at the end of the yard and,
unable to withdraw their necks, died of
suffocation.
“Y.0.Y.”: “D.” (B. 5/9/’34) men-
tions the short life of dogs. How’s
this? H. J. Stafford, of Tenindewa
(W.A.), has a sheep-dog 20 years old.
Though deaf and almost blind, it still
delights to work the flock, often making
itself an annoyance because it can’t hear
shouted orders. It has to be gently
kicked and sent home.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: Weakness would be
responsible for that albatross coming
ashore (B. 12/9/’34). Among the also-
rans as a diver, the big fowl depends
for sustenance on surface-swimming fish,
and so suffers severely in protracted bad
weather when surface fish are driven
below. For it has a mighty appetite ;
a youngster we had at Cocos could pack
away a dozen 6in. fish at a sitting and
repeat the gluttony a few hours later.
It loses condition and strength during
bad weather, at times being so weak that
it is unable to rise from the water, some-
times being washed ashore. That one
wouldn’t have felt happy on the Mon-
terey ; all the family become seasick on
a rolling ship in choppy weather.

“Sailor”: Sydney’s latest whale takes
me back to 1927, when a school of 20
stranded in the shallow water off Matupi,
Rabaul. About half a dozen got loose
on the high tide one night and floated
out into St. George’s Channel. I was
coming in from Kavieng a couple of
nights later; the Skandia had petered
out, and we were depending on fitful
gusts of a nor’-west breeze to get us into
Blanche Bay. A fairly steady puff came
up, and we began to amble along at a
four- or five-knot pace, but in the middle
of this piece of luck we experienced a soft
bump and at the same time a terrible
stench. Unhappily the breeze flattened,
and we found ourselves becalmed amongst
a bunch of derelict whales. We tried
every means of combating the odor,
from spraying the locality with crude oil
to praying for a breeze. But we had to
endure the ghastly smell for half an hour
before the wind freshened and helped us
out of reach.
* * *
“Yambergan”: “Llewellyn” on acci-
dents to birds (B. 26/9/’34) reminds me
that when the first rabbit fence was built
along the South Queensland border in
the early ’nineties the feathered casual-
ties were awful. The A.P.C. built some
private fences enclosing paddocks, and
one of these proved a deadly killer. The
country, heavily scrubbed in those days,
was alive with the beautiful scrub bronze-
wing, adjudged by many in Australia the
hardest of our birds to shoot. Going to
and from water in the morning and even-
ing these birds fly low and at a bullet-
like speed. The new fence divided them
from a favorite dam, and on it they were
“Yes, it is ’ot, but why don't y’ get round in sensible clobber, like me?”
killed in hundreds. A ride round the
fence at midday and early morning was
someting of a tragedy for lovers of
the beautiful bird. Yet in three months’
time you could ride all day and devil a
dead bronzewing. They had learned
their lesson.
❖ * * *
“Ida D.”: Black Brother’s remarkable
eyesight (B. 5/9/’34) is matched by his
“sound” sense. Our black handmaiden
at Japoon Vale (N.Q.) could hear the
cane-trains coming into the yards when
far away and quite out of sight; none
of us whites could hear anything. She
would tell us it was No. 9 engine hauling,
or No. 13, and so on —never knew her
to make a mistake. I tried for many
weeks to learn the sounds of the dif-
ferent engines, but succeeded in isolating
only a very w'heezy one, and that when
it was close in.
£ % * *
“Kali”: The best camping country in
a bad thunderstorm (B. 19/9/’34) would
be in the very ironstone localities
“Wodao” condemns. Take Darwin. For
miles outside the township ironstone
ridges and outcrops occur every few
miles. Anyone who has lived there
knows the terrific electrical storms that
rage during the change of seasons
and the vast amount of power that goes
to earth. Despite this I can’t recollect
hearing of any human or beast being
struck by lightning in the Territory.
Coming out of the picture “palace” was
usually entertaining during a bad storm ;
a long ironstone ridge ran between the
theatre and our quarters. Along this
lightning would play, snapping and siz-
zling before going to earth. Yet home-
goers walking on the same ridge wouldn’t
feel the slightest shock.
* * *
“W.T.”: As I helped my friend
Homai with the framework of his new
whare we noticed a newchum neighbor
enter the bank. “He’s gone to raise the
wind,” I said. That night we had one
of our sudden West Coast blows that
made me fear for the safety of our
unfinished building. Next morning, re-
turning to the scene of our labors, I
came on a very willing fight. Having
pulled Homai off the bloody but still
game newchum, I asked him if he had
gone mad. “Porangi notting,” said
Homai. “/ teach te cow to raise te wint;
he prow my house down.”

“Nemo”: At the Kalgoorlie Cup meet-
ing a mining man beat the books for
about a thousand pounds. He’d promised
to go out that evening, and, afraid to
leave so much money in the house,
placed the notes in a cardboard box and
buried it in the back garden. Next morn-
ing he was astounded to see notes scat-
tered all over the yard ; after a hasty
search he recovered the lot. Apparently
his fox-terrier had watched him the pre-
vious night and had dug up the box in
hopes of finding something more useful
to a pup than a thousand pounds in
paper money.
* * * *
“F.Y.7”: I agree with “Cudgerie” (B.
26/9/’34) that gidya is the finest of bush
firewoods, with a slow-dying coal which
makes damper-baking a pleasure. Doubt
if you can get ringed gidya for love or
money now. I have a beautiful silver-
topped walking-stick of it given me 30
years ago by the late E. Denny-Day, for
long g.m. of the Royal Bank of Queens-
land. He told me that it had been made
for him by a bushman as many years pre-
viously when he was an accountant in a
C.Q. bank. In those days the bush was
full of men who turned out wonderful
sticks and stockwhip handles, the latter
mostly of sweet-scented myall wood.
The carving and design of many of
these would not shame an advanced
student at Sydney Tech.
❖ *
“Cudgerie”: On the treeless .Rankin
Plain (N.T.) a small clump of whitewood
bushes forms a conspicuous landmark.
The spot is known as Kitty’s Bush,
named after a piccaninny who was once
buried there. Kitty knocked up between
the Buchanan and Rankin rivers. Her
mother, who was carrying a baby,
humped her for some distance until
she reached the whitewood clump ex-
hausted. Digging a hole in the shade
with her yam stick, she buried Kitty up
to the neck to prevent her from wander-
ing. Then, covering the toddler’s head
with boughs as shelter from the sun and
protection from dingoes and crows, she
pushed on into the Rankin 30 miles
away. Here she left her baby in the
care of other abos., and with a couple of
gins at once returned to the whitewood
clump and rescued Kitty.
>!• Jjs v *i*
“Jap.”: “Campus” was asking (B.
26/9/’34) why the soldier-bird was so
named. Probably because of its sentry
duty for kangaroos. Shooters say that,
just as they have been nearing their
game, the soldier-bird has given its
whistle (different from his ordinary note),
and the ’roos have taken the alarm and
away. The bird will warn wild cattle
and horses, too.
“Anser”: I like the reference of
“Silentio” (B. 19/9/’34) to the ability of
angry ganders to give one “a brushing”
with their wings. When a boy I stayed on
a station near Roma (Q.). In the big poul-
try yard was an old-man gander who had
the reputation of being able to lick three
loony bullocks with one wing tied behind
him. Kids were his special aversion, so
he was mostly kept with his harem in a
special yard. One morning, egged on by
a young female of the species, I climbed
the fence and scooted for the other side.
The old warrior had me cut off and
downed in a flash. Then, taking a firm
hold of my hair with his bill, he laid
into me with his tremendously powerful
wings. Help didn’t come for a couple
of minutes. If it had been much longer
there might have been a funeral.
;i: * * *
“P.R.”: Breed will tell! A red setter
owned by a pal in the Speck ran up to
him with a pleased look on his face. The
boss held his hand out, and the tyke
carefully placed in it a live canary. Not
a feather of the fowl was damaged.
* * * .
“Northcoaster”: Not often does an
emu come to grief when sprinting. The
dogs gave chase to a stray one on the
Bananaland coast; it made c.f through
the thick quinine and wattle at a great
pace, threatening to lose the hounds be-
fore they’d properly got into their stride.
But suddenly it crashed, and before we
could interfere the dogs had finished it
off. The big fowl’s thigh had been
broken, probably through getting a leg
caught in the branches of a fallen wattle,
over which it had taken a short cut.
* * * *
“Inglegar”: An old bushman used to
tell me that the black-and-white-ringed
snake took refuge from enemies in the
nests of soldier-ants. I regarded the
old man as a disciple of Ananias
until I went picnicking near Dubbo
(N.S.W.). We were breaking pieces for
the fire from a shelly-box log, when
a disturbed ring snake dived to cover in
the widish opening of a soldier-ants’
nest near the stump. Though this species
of ant will tackle any other intruder
with the utmost ferocity the inmates of
the nest didn’t take the slightest notice.
Later on I saw a similar occurrence at
Moree.
“Beelzebub”: Pleased as a dog with
two tails? My cattle bitch wasn’t, any-
way, when one of her offspring turned
up with a forked wagger. Before the
pup was two days old its dam bit off
the double tail. It was only then that
the pup and its mother began to show
signs of pleasure.
sjc % $
“Erne”: With the confidence of
bumptiousness, “U. Ralia” (B. 26/9/’34)
ticks me off as a crossword-puzzle expert
when it comes to describing eagles. He
has picked a wrong ’un this time. To
begin with, I wrote that I had never seen
a wedgetail paying a visit to the seaside.
I was born on the Upper Barcoo, and in
too many years since then have travelled
Queensland —with intervals for refresh-
ment in other countries —from Thirsty
to Mungindi, and from Cairns to Camoo-
weal. Never in all those years have I seen
a wedgetail east of the Dividing Range
—which doesn’t say he doesn’t cross it
occasionally. The wedgetail is, I fancy,
unique among the eagles in that he is
a bird of open plains. Some of his
cousins, like the harpy, live in the jungle
treetops of the Amazon. In Britain,
and generally elsewhere, the eagles
are frequenters of the hills and nest in
the crags. The Australian usually builds
a nest the size of an old-fashioned wood-
heap in a dead tree in the middle of a
ringbarked paddock, and lets it go at
that. By the way, is “U.R.” quite sure
he knows the difference between a wedge-
tail and the common carrion kite found
all over Australia?
BRACKEN-CUTTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are tasks we count a pleasure, but it
isn’t any fun
When it’s time to cut the bracken on the hill;
No, it’s not a job to treasure when you’re cut-
ting in the sun,
And it calls for perseverance more than skill.
For it’s slash, slash, slash, through the tall and
tangled bracken,
And it’s slash, slash, slash, through the dog-
wood grey:
Back and forward, back and forward, for you
hardly dare to slacken
As you slash, slash, slash, through the long
hot day.
For it’s steep upon the hillside, and it’s
shoulder-high with fern,
Scrubby clumps and saplings springing one
by one;
And you’ve got to cut it cleanly if you want
a decent burn,
For there’s other jobs awaiting to be done.
So it’s slash, slash, while the morning
dew is clinging,
And it’s slash, slash, slash, through the noon-
day blaze;
And the crescent steel keeps Hashing in a
steady rhythmic swinging
Till the western sky is splendid with the sun-
set haze.
No, there’s little satisfaction and there isn’t
any fun
When it’s time to cut the bracken on the hill;
Though it’s not a job we’re fond of, it’s a job
that must be done
If we’re going to beat the bracken to the kill.
So it’s slash, slash, slash, as the bracken topples
over,
And it’s; slash, slash, slash, as the long hours
pass.
We’ll be sowing down the paddock under
cocksfoot, rye and clover,
And you’ve got to cut the bracken if you
want to grow the grass.

“M. Quod”: Driving two donkeys in
an Abbot buggy, once the proud posses-
sion of the warden of the East Murchi-
son goldfield (W.A.), there passed through
Shepparton (Vic.) the other day en route
for Melbourne “Peter the Barber,” an
identify of the Murchison fields some
30 years back. Peter purchased the
donks at Mt. Magnet, and started on
his tour just 12 months ago. At Sand-
stone he was given the old buggy
and some harness, and after visiting the
Laverton district he passed on to Kal-
goorlie, thence along the road to South
Aus., and on to Broken Hill, eventually
working his way to Vic., crossing the
border at Tocumwal. Beyond the lone-
liness of the long journey and having to
go back over his tracks for over 100
miles on account of being on the wrong
road, he had no exciting experiences to
relate. Considering that his team aver-
ages two miles an hour when on the
road, the driver had ample time to view
the scenery. I think a record may also
be claimed for Peter and his Mt. Magnet-
bred donks.

“W.P.T.”: The Aboliar who can ex-
plain what prompts a stampede by
bullocks (B. 8/8/’34) might also explain
the means of communication by which
starlings in a clump of trees or reeds
start and stop their chatter. I’ve seen
thousands alight in a clump of trees at
“Stick around a bit, Pongo—’e might
be diggin' for worms.”
Bega (N.S.W.), and all would start chat-
tering together and stop as suddenly as
if electrocuted. It’s the same when they
take flight.

monument to the White Horse Inn, one
of the State’s oldest hostelries and associ-
ated with the first toll-gate in Victoria.
The structure occupies a commanding
position in the main street, and consists
of the salvaged wooden arch of the
entrance to the inn built in with red
bricks, surmounted by the wooden figure
of the white horse. Box Hill is one
of the very few “dry” areas in Victoria!

“Foumart”: It was revealed the
other day that there is no ban on the
admission of polecats to the Common-
wealth ; and a gentleman in the Customs
said he saw no reason
why the beasts should
not be welcomed. He
badly needs to take a
course in natural his-
tory. Since the ground-
hunting fox asserted his
sway, our ground-nest-
ing birds and mammals
have been almost wiped
out; and beside the
polecat the fox is a
mere amateur. The
polecat is one of the
most persistent and
ruthless killers of poul-
try and game known,
and in Britain, where he
is one of the curses of
the grouse moors, he is
shot and trapped with-
out mercy. One of his
drawbacks is that his
scent is so unspeakably foul that no dog
can be induced to tackle him.

“Dr. Mivart”: Let me take issue with
“Felis” (B. 19/9/’34), who says that “the
huge descendants of tame f'ffs gone
wild” have been credited by mistaken
coves as indigenous to Australia. The
domestic cat of the Old World was in-
troduced to this continent not more than
170 years ago, and if any species of
animal can add anything appreciable to
its stature in that period, no matter how
favorable its environment, accepted
notions regarding the speed of the evo-
lutionary process will have to be en-
tirely revised. So the risk of being made
an F.R.G.S. will still menace “Felis’s”
opponents if they produce their huge
cats and it is proved they are true to
the imported type.

“Deg.”: At Keppel Island (Q.) sharks
are less a menace than a nuisance. The
smaller fish seem to keep more than
usual in the coral beds, never straying
beyond where they can beat a shark in
a free-for-all to the coral. Wading out
to meet the incoming tide, over sand-
banks, you can see sharks wriggling in
all around, and a .303 rifle is useful.
Stringrays are everywhere; they glide
away from you like shadows in the
greenness, and can carry a lot of lead.
An old file fastened to a sapling, used as
a harpoon, provides a better weapon,
though the lancer is sometimes lanced
by the rays in the turmoil after the har-
pooning. Sharks frequently glide up
behind and cause an involuntary leap,
usually followed by yells and a fusillade
of rifle fire. To the eye the sharks
appear to outnumber the edible fish.
Luckily, netting yields plenty of the
latter, and rod-and-line optimists occa-
sionally get coral trout, red-throat, cod,
blue-tooth and Red Emperor past the
hovering sharks.
“Here’s the weather report, sir. 'Sea, calm; wind, fair to
moderate; clear skies and rising temperature.’”
'‘Aqua”: A Graf-
ton (N.S.W.) mother
laid her baby on a
bed standing against
a wall, first punching
a deep hole in the
clothes to prevent it
rolling off. A rain-
storm blew up, and
the mother, busy in
the kitchen, heard a
queer gurgling. Go-
ing to the bedroom
she found her nipper
half submerged in a
rapidly rising pool of
water. The storm had
blown the rain in under the eaves of the
iron-roofed house on to the bed, where it
collected in the depression.

“Groper”: The Bananaland stone-iish
recently made an appearance in these
pages; let me introduce
its Westralian namesake.
A genuine fish, shaped
something like a bream,
white, with markings of
reddish-brown. Quite
stingless, but surely the
best piece of living imita-
tion stone that freakish
Nature ever created.
Squarish in general out-
line, it is covered with a
hard silicious skin which
feels like sandstone and
turns the blade of a
knife. Dropped on the
floor of a boat Stony
thuds like a brick. Trod-
den on with a heavy boot
it displays no sign of dis-
comfort. But its most
curious feature is the tail,
which would be quite un-
bendable but for two
articulations of leathery
skin which barely allow
the fish to swim. Lives
in fairly deep water,
takes a baited hook and
comes up like a drowned
boot. Probable means of
defence, indigestion ; that
would certainly be the fate of even a
shark if it dined on a W.A. stone-fish.

“Tipada”: “Morning glories” (B.
12/9/’34)? Down at our atoll in the
Indian Ocean we frequently experienced
the reverse of these rainless storms.
Following the end of the wet season
we would get a month or so of perfect
weather —a gentle nor’-easter blowing
and not a cloud in the sky. Nevertheless,
on days like these we sometimes had
as much as 10 points of rain from a
cloudless sky.

“Publico”: From a N.Q. paper, which
acknowledges its indebtedness to a
Sydney journal:
The wobbegong shark has a peculiar
attack. If its victim remains still the
shark will let go, but it will hang on and
tear the flesh if the victim struggles.
Verification wanted? At Keppel Is. (Q.)
a man dragging a net in the shallows
felt something seize the seat of his pants.
Divining instantly that it was a wobbe-
gong and not a tiger, grey-nurse, basking,
white, sjsotted or nondescript shark, he
f.t? od sbb whistled an air from
Patience. The wobbegong, for such it
was ; relinquished its grip and, after an

aen Ei be : Mt. Gambler is not the
only extinct volcano to boast a lake of
distinctive coloring. Mt. Eccles, over
the border, has a lake whose water
is even greener than that of the celebrated
one at the Mount is blue. Bushmen
always steer wide of green water. Yet
the Vic.- lake is clear and fresh; English
trout thrive in it. The banks, sloping
steeply for hundreds of feet to the water’s
edge, are thickly timbered and overhung
with gum-trees. The reflection gives the
lake its distinctive coloring.

“D.H.0.” (Rossel Island, Papua):
Abos. were responsible for cocoanuts
not growing along the foreshore of the
N.Q. coast as they do on the coast of
Papua. The blacks destroyed the young
palms and ate the heart out of the plant.
Drifting cocoanuts were common along
the coast between Port Douglas and
Cooktown when we were kids, about 50
years ago. Young palms grown from
nuts around camps were swooped on by
Binghi when the camps were deserted.
Nuts were planted on Schnapper Island
by Bill Hood (“Old Scottie”). Rats or
crabs may be responsible for cocoanuts
not growing on North Hope and other
islands. Wild pigs and cattle have kept
them down on the mainland since.

“The Breaker”: In the dim long ago
I took delivery off trucks at Marree
(S.A.) of 400-odd cows left alive from
a mob of 1000 that had been entrained.
No poorer or weaker old frames ever
travelled the Birdsville stock route, and,
with the track as bare for feed as a
metallic road would be, four miles a
day was more than enough for the old
girls. And bores were 10 to 20 miles
apart. Intuition, however, came to the
cows’ assistance. After a drinkless day
they would pair off, head to tail, and
suck away at milkless teats. I’ve
punched a few mobs of cattle in my time,
but have never seen or heard of cattle
wetting their whistles in such a manner.
Any doubters?

“Briscoe Dare”: Crow-catching? As
boys, during the southern N. S. Wales
winter when snow covered the ground,
we used to make paper cones with an
opening about an inch and a half round.
The inside was smeared with birdlime,
and a piece of meat was dropped in;
then the cones were stuck point-first into
the snow. One and then another crow
would come to investigate ; invariably the
cones stuck over their heads. Blinded,
and unable to rid themselves of the
appendages, the birds would cut queer
capers and were easily caught.
THE VANISHING FOREST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Nightfall and noon, in the lush summer
grasses,
The dried bluebell stalks by the rustling
tracks
Sing a lament for the forest that passes,
Sigh for the acres laid low by the axe.
Lonely the bridge that the lightwood caresses,
Save when a motor-car, hurrying on
Over the timbers, hung green with fern tresses,
Thunders, and echoes a space, and is gone.
Sunrise and -set, at the bend of the river,
Steeped in the noonday or numbed with the
frost,
The firetails flit and the flowering reeds shiver,
The blackfish flicks over a pool and is lost.
Silence, except when the grey kookaburra,
The crimson rosellas, the black cockatoos,
Wing from the circling vale of the Yarra
Into its pageant of purples and blues.
Only the owl and the silver-grey ’possum
Hearing at nightfall the waters’ refrain;
Only the gold of the gay wattle-blossom
Flooding the ridges made gracious with rain.
Sunset and star, by the bend of the river,
Only the mopoke to call to the moon,
Where the winds and the waters are mourning
for ever
Their lovely lost heritage, nightfall and noon.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
WOOL IN THE DOLDRUMS.
Wool is properly in the doldrums. The
market has followed the course which
The Bulletin alone prophesied for it.
The best opinion thinks that there may
be a 10 p.c. or 15 p.c. recovery on
present prices, but it will take more than
that to make the business payable. The
average, about 9-jrd., is only .7d. better
than in September, 1932, and it is
approximately less than half the aver-
age of January, 1934 (19.9 d.). At bdst
the per pound return for the year will
be about the same as for 1929-30 season.
Bradford wool-top prices have fallen
since the season opened—about 2d. for
70’s. Crossbreds, from 36’s to 58’s come-
back super, range from Id. to lid. better
than in mid-season 1932-33. Continental
top stocks, except in Germany and Bel-
gium, were heavier at the beginning of
1933-34 than they were at the same
period of 1932, and Germany is deter-
mined to weather through on artificials
if the German press may be believed.
Ships which usually leave Sydney at
this time of year crammed with bales are
lying in Australian harbors empty. One
which is normally a favorite in the wool
race and carries some thousands of tons
got 18 bales the other day at one port.
A few days ago, Dr. Earle Page re-
marked: “I was astounded at the tre-
mendous amount of wool which had been
withdrawn from sale.” At' present rate of
withdrawal 600,000 bales will be accu-
mulated at the season’s end.
If wool averages lOd. against 16d. in
1933-34 and sales are as large as they
were last season the return to Australia
will be about £33,000,000 ; but on present
indications turnover will not be as large.
The total return for the last season was
about £52,000,000.
The situation is bad beyond its purely
economic reactions. Failure to warn the
grower of what was coming and the con-
sistent attempt of almost every authority
to gloss over the poor prospects of the
season have created widespread unrest.
Graziers can scarcely be blamed if they
think there is something wrong with the
system. Last season this feeling led to
country selling to speculators widespread
enough to call for drastic measures by
the wool-selling associations. Obviously,
the disintegration of the elaborate auc-
tion organisation might lead to unbridled
speculation and a scramble by wool-
owners, in a harassing year like the
present, to get any prices cash buyers
cared to offer.
Before the season opened, however,
organisation originating with the British
Wool Federation made this impossible.
Over 90 per cent, of members of this
buyers’ body signed an undertaking “not
to buy or sell or be interested in the sale
of any wool in N. S. Wales or Queens-
land which had not been submitted to
auction.” In June M. Dubrulle, presi-
dent of the International Wool Federa-
tion, cabled from Rome:
International Wool Textile organisation
agrees upon desirability of not supporting
Newcastle sales, secondary markets or
country buying.
The Department of Commerce is silent
and inactive, as usual. It apparently
proposes to dally as it did with, wheat
last year, and, presently, possibly there
will be another long-distance commis-
sion which will wander round the coun-
try listening to twaddle for months on
end. There is urgent need for a plan
which will promote sales and arrange a
bill-financing scheme that will lighten
the interest burdens of producers —the
N.Z. Banking Commission has just re-
commended such a scheme for agricul-
ture in general—and assure that growers
will get paid for their product at once
instead of having to wait for six or seven
months for a return.
It is a serious matter for the whole of
Australia, and it should be the first busi-
ness of the new Parliament.
LONG-TERM STABILITY NEEDED.
“512”: The proposal to finance the
Australian wool clip through the use
of the London bill market (B. 29 /8 / ’34)
and spread the sales seems good, but
does not go far enough.
Stability of wool price level, over a
term, is what Australia needs more than
anything.
The present system, which allows the
average price to jump from 8.5 d. to
16.4 d., and then, say, back to 9.5 d. per
pound, all in 15 months, completely up-
sets property and stock values, and un-
stabilises the internal economy of the
grazing industry.
The exact figure at which that stability
is attained is not of paramount import-
ance. Grazier’s costs can be adjusted to
any figure within reason over a term of
years. To obtain stability should not be
impossible. With long-term bill finance
and a scientific appraisement system, one
year’s high price can offset the low price
of another year, and a permanent steady
return be assured the grazier,
The position to-day is far more serious
than our politicians and public opinion
seem to realise. If Australia is not to
slip back into depression she and her
graziers had better get down to reali-
ties and act quickly.

and men both vary.
ec ces Vtiry ticcording to type, soil
an<a seas °ns. It would be folly to spoil
a top line for the sake of an extra inch
or two of skirtings, and the wool, if
intelligently sorted, is not lost,
The up-to-the-minute classer works
his clip according to existing conditions,
Men vary because they are human,
and many would improve with coaching!
How many classers demonstrate to the
wool-rollers the correct way to work?
The untutored roller works much
harder than need be. I have seen two
capable men rolling thoroughly fleeces
for 10 average shearers. Two for eight
would be a better working rule.
If the roller commences always at the
breech end, picking off the stained por-
tion first, walking thence along the side
towards the neck, rolling the fleece in
behind him, moving the hands low and
across the fleece rather than high in the
air (this tires him unduly), he will soon
find that a great deal of unnecessary
walking up and down will be saved.
Moreover, when work is systematic
the classer can readily detect irregularity
before it reaches his table.
The portions of shoulder and neck
removed depend on the fleece and the
judgment of the classer. Each roller
must be taught to skirt round a leg or
point and not directly across it.
“Mouton’s” statement that most station
clips are free is misleading, and when he
adds that there should be no first pieces
with correct skirting he certainly errs.
There will always be board-locks,
table-locks, bellies, stained pieces, first
and perhaps second pieces, broken fleece
and necks when and wherever rolling,
skirting and piece-picking are properly
carried out.
“THE OLD BOUGH-SHED.”
“McKinlay”: A bough-shed was
used extensively by the travelling shear-
ing-plants of yesterday. Many still press
the “old shed” into service.
It has invariably a one-sided board,
with woolroom at the end. This style
was adopted for economy. Lack of
timber often necessitated one post doing
the job of two. Four lines of posts for
(a) machinery, ( b ) front of catching-pens,
(c) back of ditto and (cl) back of penning-
up race held the mkin structure until
the woolroom was reached. Rails
twitched on to these posts, sometimes
mortised in, formed catching-pens, let-
ting-go pens and back race, with a short
post wherever necessary.
Similar rails served as rafters for the
skill ion roof._ On the latter was run
No. 10 wire or wire-netting, with 3ft. of
boughs packed on top. Sometimes the
roof would be covered with bulrushes,
while a really good thatch was achieved
with cane-grass. Hurdles, loosely-wired,
replaced gates.
For the catching-pens an earth floor
answered, while a portable shearing-
board, made in 10ft. sections for carting
about, was usually provided with the
plant.
The flooring for the woolroom was
made by sewing old woolsacks into a
large carpet of sufficient size to cover
back to the press. This, placed on even
ground, was ideal to work on.
Posts, appropriately spaced, with rails
wired on and the same old wool pack
hung therefrom, were the wool-bins.
Woolpack hessian coverings were sewn
into flies to ward off wind and sun. The
job was a mighty cool and comfortable
place to earn your money in.
POLWARTHS.
“Jumbuck”: Although an inbred
comeback, the Polwarth has become so
stabilised that it will breed true to type.
Admirers have formed their own asso-
ciation, and the straight progeny will
be eligible for inclusion in the stud book
at the fifth generation.
The wool (equivalent to an extra-long
staple merino 58’s) in 1924-25 sold up to
50id. per lb. in Sydney, with lambs’
wool up to 414 d. in Geelong.
With economic conditions abroad as
they are, and mediocre values likely to
rule for super-fine merino wools in com-
parison with super 60’s and 64’s, a good
forager and heavy cutter of bulky wool
like the Polwarth should find favor with
graziers who are disheartened at the fine-
wool results. The Polwarth ewe is ideal
as a mother of fat lambs.
CRUTCH AND CRUTCH.
“Sheepo”: “G.F.D.” says to combat
flies one needs to dip, jet and crutch
(B. 19/9/’34). A wise procedure, but
expenses are beyond the means of many
graziers.
The C.S.I.R. has proved that no dip-
ping or jetting fluid will give immunity
from strike for any longer than a
wether’s tail.
My own experiences have been that
when flies were bad both dipping and
jetting were waste of time and money.
Although weaners cannot be crutched
twice, owing to the comb running over
the wool, I must admit that the only
good results I ever had, both in normal
and “plenty fly” times, were through
crutching twice a year, plus the use of
a hospital paddock, where I kept sheep
in hand for treatment by swabbing.
“G.F.D.” does not seem to agree with
me that “not one per cent, of graziers
in Q’land has a dip.” He mentions over
40 sheep properties in his district that
either have dips or access to one.
“G.F.D.” could take a trip from Clon-
curry to Hughenden and across to Long-
reach, and amongst hundreds of pro-
perties he’d be able to count the dips on
the fingers of one hand.
JETTING IS BEST.
“letter”: In 1916, one of the worst
blowfly years in Central Queensland, we
crutched our sheep, but had to dress
sheep three weeks afterwards.
In 1920, also a bad year and very wet,
we installed a jetting plant and used
ordinary yellow powder dip. We jetted
80,000 ewes with lambs at foot and
marked the lambs. The losses were
trifling.
Others who crutched had to keep
dressing for weeks afterwards. My ex-
perience suggests that jetting, if done
properly, is the more efficient.
MERINO-SHEEP EMBARGO.
“H.U.C.”: “Valerin” (B. 8/8/’34)
settles one argument quite well. He
might also have mentioned another im-
portant point in favor of the embargo:
it keeps down the price of all rams sold
locally, and the small farmers (who own
a large proportion of the sheep in Aus-
tralia) can now afford to buy rams to
improve their flocks. When rams are
being exported up goes the price of all
rams, and many small men are forced
to breed from mongrels.
FOUNDER IN HORSES.
“Sorghum”: The disease can be
easily avoided if horses are not over-
worked, fed on ripe wheat or left stand-
ing in a cold wind after a day’s work.
The disease is really an inflammation of
the liminae —the sensitive part of the
foot —and is easily identifiable. The
affected animal shows timidity in move-
ments involving the transference of
weight on the diseased feet. The pulse
is fast and quick; heavy breathing is
noticed.
The old-fashioned treatment was to
stand the horse on wet sawdust or bleed
the foot. Avoid such practices, which
will either kill the animal or lead to
the development of weak pasterns.
The best method is to rasp the foot
convexly or rocker fashion so that the
weight of the horse does not fall heavily
on the front of the hoof, which is usu-
ally the most painful part.
Having first alleviated the pain, poul-
tice with warm bran mash, which should
be changed every day.
Keep the horse either in a stable
covered with plenty of dry, soft straw
or in an enclosed, soft, grassy yard.
There are several proprietary cures
for founder on the market.
SADDLE SORES.

man who has done big and fast riding
who has not at some time chafed a

horse’s back. A badly-lined or worn
saddle will do it; a wrinkle in the cloth
might be responsible; a fat horse and a
hot day may induce sweat boils.
That last is the most common cause.
The best preventive I know is common
soap. At night wash the nag’s saddle-
mark, rub in the soap, lather well and
heavily and let him go with the lather
on. Don’t wash it off —it seems to draw
all the heat from the saddle.
When attempting to cure a sore back
any oily preparation is worse than use-
less. With the sun beating down on the
horse the oil on the tender spot serves
as a blister, and spreads the sore instead
of curing it. A sprinkling of baking-
soda for drying, a dab of kerosene for
softening and cleansing—those are two
of the best simple bush remedies. If
a horse has to be worked with a sore,
blacklead is preferable to while. Black-
lead puts a shiny, slidy surface which
is a protection in itself. With the cloth
folded so as to lift the saddle clear of
the sore, and with the judicious use of
soda, kerosene and blacklead, a man may
cure a horse while doing steady work.
(It can’t be done on fast work.) Many
men make the mistake of folding the
cloth to serve as a pad on the sore.
That aggravates the trouble. Fold the
cloth to lift the saddle off the sore.
For “set-fasts” there is no remedy.
Blistering and a long spell do a bit of
good in the early stages. But the blis-
tered back is always tender, and on fast
work a tender spot must go. Strange
as it may seem, bareback riding is most
responsible for set-fasts. When a man
rides bareback there is but little packing
between him and the horse. The horse
doesn’t chafe —he bruises deeply, and the
sore works up from below the skin,
leaving something that is the devil and all
to cure.
HANDLING A HORSE.
“Klinger”: Some fellows holding a
horse without a bridle put a hand over
the nostrils. That gives no added lever-
age. It only increases the horse’s dis-
comfort, and induces it to fight for
freedom. A better result is obtained by
putting one arm round the horse’s neck,
with the other hand spread over the
bone of the nose above its nostrils.
Almost invariably when picking up a
front leg, the lifter lets the fetlock sit
in the cup of his hand. Wrong! In
that position the horse rests all his weight
on the man, and has the power to use
its legs with effect. When the hoof is
up, grip the toe of it between thumb and
fingers. It is a precarious hold ; but it
cramps the horse’s style. With the fet-
lock joint bent it cannot rest weight on
the leg.
If a horse pulls back and the man hold-
ing the reins tries tug-o’-war he places
himself on a level with his adversary.
Not even those who advertise in the
physical-culture magazines can hold a
horse by strength alone. Moral: Never
try a straight pull. Run back with the
horse, get some slack on the reins and
pull to one side on an angle, thus throw-
ing the horse off its balance.
Instead of sweating to back a horse by
brute force, gather the loose skin where
his neck joins his chest, pinch slightly,
push easily in the direction in which the
horse is to go, and the right thing will
happen. Incidentally, mares are much
more responsive than geldings, and the
more ticklish the mare the quicker she
acts.
Finally, the golden rule is to get close
to a horse when working it. Rest against
it, rub against it, lean the weight on it.
The closer the safer. A kick at close
quarters is only a swinging and unaimed
push.

returning spent blood to the heart;
the real milk veins are internal. The
so-called milk wells are simply holes
in the flesh walls to allow entry
of the return veins. The feel, shape
and size of the udder are reliable
indicators. Here again experience alone
can judge. Large fleshy bags .are useless ;
they must be silky. Badly connected fore
and aft, they reduce the working life of
many good cows by breaking away.
Length and continuity of service are
more vital than one good B.F. record.
Pure-bred records discount tails and
horns as evidence.
As for selecting by families, line-breed-
ing alone can ensure success, and that
is beyond most cow-cockies. Two win-

SUMMING UP ON SILAGE.
“Amber”: Like the chap who dis-
covered a lake out west in the wet season
and the other fellow who discovered a
desert in the same place in the “dry,”
“X.T.,” “St. Andrews” and also
“Sorghum” are each right up to a point.
“St. Andrews” (B. 26/9/’34) is definite
that silage is too costly and laborious to
handle compared with pressed or bailed
hay, and quotes his experience of 40
years with agricultural experts. Agricul-
tural experts, however, like other people,
move with the times, and the methods
of silage-making to-day are different
from the methods to which “St.
Andrews” refers.
In the early days the main aim was to
make the pit as deep as possible so that
the weight of fodder would press the
air out.
Thus pits were excavated 15ft. to 20ft.
deep, and, as “St. Andrews” says, great
was the labor when removing the fodder.
Coastal dairy cockies went in for tub or
overhead silos, 25ft. to 30ft. above
ground level, and with their base 4ft. to
sft. below ground level.
To-day the pit silo consists of a trench
sft. to 6ft. deep, about 65ft. long and
21ft. wide, cut to hold about 100 tons.
The main work is done on well-drained
land with a plough and scoop, the sides
being afterwards trimmed with a spade.
The ends should have an easy slope to
enable a horse and dray to enter and
leave, and the width should be governed
by the width of drays or carts in use.
A main aim is to place as much fodder
above as below ground, giving the same
slope at the ends above as below. This
enables an even pressure and even shrink-
age. As the material settles more fodder
can be added, until the heap remains
equal above and below. Then a layer
of soil 9in. to Ift. thick is thrown over the
heap to exclude air and shed rain. Trench
silos are O.K. in N.S.W. for western
and coastal conditions. Recently on the
coast a dairy cocky was surprised to find
his pit silage satisfactory, although flood-
waters had covered the silo for a week.
I don’t agree with “X.T.” (B. 5/9/’34)
lhat silage can be made for 3s. or 4s.
a ton. Ten shillings a ton should be a
fair average cost on the N.S.W. North
Coast. It may be cheaper in Queens-
land and the Riverina.
“Sorghum” (B. 19/9/’34) harvests
maize on the sappy side to cut when
grain is milky. It is actually advisable
to cut maize when the grains are dented
or glazed and crop still green. Most
other crops can be cut just after flower-
ing. Lucerne, as “X.T.” states, will make
silage, but by using such crops as lucerne
and clovers one loses the main value of
such protein-rich fodders. I believe it
wiser to make hay of lucerne and
clovers. The use of common salt, as
advised by “Sorghum,” will certainly add
a relish or seasoning to the silage, but
salt in no way assists the silage process.
It is better to leave it out of the silage
and feed it as a lick with the finished
product.
Silage is only a succulent, laxative
food, with no claim to being capable of
maintaining stock in good condition in-
definitely. It is well known that sheep
will do fairly well on silage alone, if
not kept on it too long. After a few
weeks on silage alone they lose condi-
tion unless rich-protein feed, such as
lucerne hay or maize or oat grain, is
added.
Generally speaking, while dry feed is
obtainable, one ton of silage a day will
feed 2000 sheep. When dry feed is scarce
give 21b. of silage per sheep per day, to-
gether with lucerne hay or 3oz. to
4oz. of oats or maize grain. For cows
the N.S.W. Agricultural Department re-
commends 31b, of silage and lib. of
lucerne hay per 1001 b. body weight, with
a concentrate mixture of bran, pollard,
cracked or crushed grain, and linseed-
meal at lib. of concentrate per 31b. to
41b. of milk produced daily. Thus the
department’s Jersey herd is given in
winter 301 b. of silage and 101 b. of
lucerne hay, plus lib. of concentrates for
every 31b. of milk produced.
About the only stock for which silage
is not suitable are horses and bulls, which
tend to develop pot-bellies if fed on
very much silage.
THE INEFFICIENT FARMER.
“Mick”: Australia should have no use
for inefficient farmers, or the ones on
land which has to be squeezed for a liv-
ing or produces inferior products. These
are the people who cause gluts, to the
detriment of themselves and the com-
munity, because they have to keep pro-
duction up to maintain their poor stock,
land and methods.
Take two types of cases which I can
vouch for:
Potato Growing.
Farm A. Farm B.
(Inferior.) (Efficient.)
Net Income £124/10/- £126/10/-
Yield per acre 3 tons 4 tons
Area planted 60 acres 20 acres
Cost per acre (f.0.b.).. £l5/18/6 £l7/13/6
Sale price per ton .... £6 £6
Total sold 180 tons 80 tons
Surplus inferior crop 100 tons.
Dairying.
Farm A. Farm B.
(Inferior.) (Efficient.)
Net Income £lOO £lOO
B/fat per cow 2501 b. 3001 b.
Number of cows .. 77 48
B/fat sold 19,2001 b. 14,4001 b.
Production costs .. per lb. lOd. per lb.
Surplus fat from inefficient farm 48001 b.
In these days the majority of farmers
are'struggling to make a bare living, and
the above shows what the inefficient
farmer or the farmer on sub-marginal
lands does to keep going. Spud-grower
“A” and dairyman “A” force a further
100 tons spuds and 48001 b. butter-fat
respectively on to an already glutted
market, in order to earn the same bare
living as do their efficient neighbors.
Of course, in practice these fellows
don’t always make even a bare living,
but even so their effect on the market
remains, inasmuch as they are producing
too much in proportion to their returns.
Under normal conditions of competition,
they would be eliminated, but with boun-
ties and bonuses they are encouraged to
survive. In many cases, the greater the
inefficiency the greater the bounty or
bonus. We want better farms, better
cattle, more prolific grain yield per acre,
better farming.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
‘'Billy See”: For an emergency bag-
ging-needle straighten the loop of a
sardine-tin key and sharpen to a point.
“A.G.T.”: To make a yard gate, strip
off all bearings on an angle-iron win-
nower frame from an old 6ft. Sunshine
wood-frame harvester except two rocker
bearings for hinges. Cover the frame
with rabbit-netting, stretch tight and
securely tie.
“A.J.”: A bit of an old crosscut saw
makes a capital cowyard manure-
scraper. Bore a hole in the centre of
about 2ft. of sawblade and one in each
end. Screw the centre hole to a handle
and stay with plain wire to the other
holes.
“Murrawong”: At the start of shear-
ing, or where fleeces to be skirted are
very burry, the backs of wool-rollers
hands and wrists often swell up and be-
come painful. Paint the swollen parts
with iodine and tie the first and second
fingers of the affected hand together with
a piece of string—not so tight as to
affect the circulation. It is awkward at
first, but it rests strained muscles.
“Wongi”: If Dobbin’s sides are chafed
by plough chains widen the swingletree.
Rub on some mutton-fat with a little
blacklead and sulphur added, and the
hair will soon grow. It’s a better idea
than sheepskin or motor-tyre pads.
“A.G.T.”: Always scrape the chaff
from the elevator lower bearings when
finishing chaff-cutting for the night If
the bearings have overheated, a slow,
smouldering fire may spring to life hours
afterwards.
“J.H.”: As a thick, cool smoke is
essential for apiary work try this method:
Make a fire in the bottom of the smoker
—say, cotton-wool and wood shavings :
then fill with green grass. The smoke
filters through the grass absolutely cool.

MISSED OPPORTUNITY.
My wife and I would be much hap-
pier if I had not, by marrying her, de-
prived her of the chance of being one of
the world’s wealthiest women.
You see, if her father had saved his
money instead of backing horses, he
might have been rich. And if he had
not had seven other daughters, he could
have taken her into society, had he cared
about such things, and given her a chance
of meeting men of wealth and position.
And if she had taken a fancy to one of
them she could have married him—if he
wanted to marry her, and nobody ob-
jected, and he didn’t die before the cere-
mony. And if he didn’t lose his money
and they didn’t get divorced, she would
have lived in luxury.
But because I married her (which I
wouldn’t have done if I had known) I
am accused of having interfered with all
her opportunities.

out of the operating theatre, and imme-
diately I came in I got to work. Now,
the point I failed on was the same weak-
ness I reveal when playing bridge;
namely, that I forget to count the ones
that have gone. The consequence was
that when removing the rolls of fat I
lost count, and took off, if I remember
rightly, seven instead of five, the last one
proving very obstinate and difficult to
dislodge.
When the swathe was removed I was
somewhat dismayed to find that I
had removed his six double chins and his
original one. My fool of an assistant
had thoughtlessly left him lying on his
back instead of turning him over. It
was rather regrettable, but, after all, the
fault was not wholly mine. Unfortu-
nately, a heartless jury thought differ-
ently, and awarded him full damages.
My practice was ruined.

—Counsel to witness, Sydney court.
While allowing that lawyers as a body
are the smartest hair-splitters on earth
and, consequently, are dangerous oppo-
nents with whom to cross verbal swords,
I emphatically maintain that the member
of the tribe responsible for the above
statement was wrong —there are other
ways of standing besides standing up.
What about the fellow who stands down?

Birds were singing, the sun shone, the
air was crystal clear. All nature was
alive.
She smiled. She would write again
what she had written many, many times
before. She felt sure it would not be
rejected now.
All through the hot summer and far
into late autumn she had written the
same thing, often faintly and rather
timidly, but now she felt supremely con
fident.
Dipping her pen in the ink, she wrote
firmly and boldly on the boarding-house
menu “Spring Cabbage.”

“Pass the salt,” said Muggs.
“No salt to-day, dear,” explained his
wife. “We were one off a prize ; but
you can have some of those potatoes we
won in the greengrocer’s lottery.”
“Potatoes, potatoes, nothing but
potatoes,” growled Muggs. “I’m almost
sorry we won that prize. And why must
we always have cold dinners?”
“You know we haven’t won a prize in
the gas sweep for months.”
“Then what about the firewood mer-
chant. Couldn’t you win something
from him?”
“I’m so sorry,” Mrs. Muggs apologised.
“We only won a consolation prize of a
pound of potatoes from him.”
“Oh, well, never mind. Our luck’s
sure to change. I’ve got a seventh share
in a ticket for a lobster supper and a

BROKEN REVERIE.
Leaning ort the gate of his little cot-
tage, he gazed up the winding road
towards the far-off hills. The last flush
of sunset had faded, and evening was
settling over them, richly purple.
The atmosphere was filled with a
beautiful calm ; it seemed a time sacred
to meditation. Old fancies welled up in
his mind, thoughts of the beauty, the
poetry of life, thoughts of his ideals, his
dreams. His own being seemed to be-
come fused into the glory of nature, and
he was stirred with feelings that were
akin to inspiration.
Came a female voice from the cot-
tage :
“Hey, Jim! Bring in them rubbish-
tins, will y’?”

THE PARIAH.
Whene’er he passes now he notes with

The eye of scorn, the contumelious

Where once fond greetings met him,
smiles of gladness,
Now there are bitter looks as he draws
near.
Some heinous crime, you ask, caused all
this foment
Of fierce, strong hatred, this repug-
nance ? No!
The fact is, in a weak, unguarded
moment,
The ass agreed to judge a baby show.

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
VII. — The Actor.
The actor that you see to-day
As villain bold or hero,
Ned Kelly, Thunderbolt or, say,
Macbeth, Legree or Nero,
Was once a child like you or me
Who prattled at his mother’s knee
And gladdened her old heart.
Observe him now ! His stance, his walk,
His dress, his manner and his talk !
Completely wedded to his art —
No more a man, but just a “part.”
Actors start young and finish late—
many of them, too late. The true actor
of to-day made his debut as Little Willie
in “East Lynne” and was duly taken to
heaven by the angels. A long appren-
ticeship as “boy” in Shakspearean
plays followed, varied with occasional
appearances as “noise off-stage” and
“laughter from without,” leading up
to “crowd” parts. His first lead-
ing part was usually that of comedian.
Then he became a hero, and finally a
villain. Villain parts were very much
sought after. The hero always triumphs
at the end of the play, but the villain is
on top right through until the last five
minutes, so naturally he doesn’t begrudge
the hero his moment at the finish.
An all-round training like this was
very effective. Many actors have ap-
peared in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” in every
part from Little Eva to Uncle Tom him-
self, including the bloodhounds. Com-
plications sometimes arose, as in the
case of the actor who used to play Uncle
Tom and Simon Legree on alternate
nights, and was never sure whether it
was his turn to whip or to be whipped.
This didi.'t matter so very
much, but one night he was
playing Macbeth and mis-
took himself for Duncan.
The show was completely
ruined, as he got confused
and murdered himself.
An actor can usually be
recognised by his walk.
When he enters a room you
can see in a moment that
it is not merely an office,
a study or a drawing-room
he is entering, but the
throne-room of the Palace
of Versailles. If he strolls
down the street to post a
letter he is on his way to
the Forum to denounce
Brutus. He steps on a tram
and is riding in triumph
through Persepolis.
His speech, too, is a thing
apart. He speaks as one
who has talked with kings
and retains but a precari-
ous hold on the common
touch. The trouble is that
he has in his time played
so many parts that he has
forgotten his real self.
Not so the talkie actor.
He doesn’t have to unlive
his part. This is particu-
larly true of the character
actor. A character actor is one who
interprets all parts in terms of his own
character. He plays only one part, but
he plays it over and over again under
various names and in various settings.
Hamlet, John the Baptist, Sweeney Todd
and Gladstone are as one to him.
The talkie world refers to the theatre
as the legitimate stage. Real actors do
not refer to the talkies.

THRILLING THE EMPIRE.
“The whole wide Empire is on tiptoe with
excitement over the engagement of Prince
George and Princess Marina, and all London is

If some strange visitor from Mars,
Or any of the kindred stars,
Or that lone inmate of the moon
Whose sole repast is honey,
Were suddenly among us loosed
He might be easily excused
For thinking that this famous pair
INVENTED matrimony.

Sydney on May 28, 1883, Foley became recog-
nised as heavyweight champion of Australia.
His last fight, was supposed to be with one
Fagan in 1888, so he was 41 when he retired.
Which steamer in Australian waters or
trading to Australia has steamed the greatest
mileage in her lifetime to date? —3733.
No exact records available, though probably
the Edina, of Melbourne, which is the oldest
steamer afloat, would hold this honor. It is
claimed that this ship has steamed 5,500,000
miles. The Niagara, which has been in con-
stant service since 1913, has steamed nearly
2,000,000 miles, and the Makura, with a longer
service still, must have exceeded this record.
The Dimboola must also have an impressive
mileage; also the Oonah, which has run in the
Tasmanian trade for 50 years or more.
What is the true story of the Mararoa’s
eagles ? These, I understand, were three brass
eagles which were fitted to the old-fashioned
tail rods of the ship. Where are they now ?
—3728.
When the Mararoa was new on the San
Francisco run in 1886 McAllister, her chief
engineer, was presented by the Marine Engin-
eers’ Society of ’Frisco with three brass
eagles, which were fixed on the tops of her
tailrods —a large one for the low-pressure rod,
small one for the high-pressure and a medium
size for the intermediate. When tailrods were
done away with, the eagles disappeared. Cap-
tain Post, of Wellington, M.L., formerly Gov-
ernment captain of lighthouse vessels, has one
as a lamp standard at the foot of his stairs;
Mr. McAllister, now marine engineer for the
North Coast S.S. Co. in Sydney, has another
on his car as a mascot. The third is believed
to be in ’Frisco.
What was “the desert line” in the N.S.W.
railways ? —3739.
The term was applied to the length from
Condobolin to Trida before the line was com-
pleted to Broken Hill. Trains running out from
Condobolin carried a water tank and relief
crews, who slept in a special car. Now that
the express runs right through these arrange-
ments are not needed.
When did the Tumullah (N.S.W.) railway
smash occur, and what was the nature of the
accideiit ? —3741.
On October 4, 1922, a train loaded with live
cattle got out of control going down the
Tumullah bank on the west side of Bathurst
and ran into a dead-end. Five cattle trucks
were smashed and many of. the cattle were
killed.
(1) Is there a sulphate of copper method of
preserving fishing lines ? (2) If so, quantity to
use for best results?— 33l6.
(1) Copper salts, not sulphates, are used for
preserving fishing nets, and presumably the
method is applicable to fishing lines. (2) A
5 p.c. to 10 p.c. solution of copper oleate in
benzol or petrol is used, with the addition of 1
p.c. of paraffin oil or kerosene. Oleate can be
obtained from Robert Corbett and Co , 379
Kent-street, Sydney.

/am an amateur singer. While awaiting my
turn on the programme I am afflicted with
nervousness and dryness of the throat. How
can l overcome this ? —3702.
Oil days of rehearsal and performance take
plenty of breathing exercises and fresh air,
but no salty, alcoholic or other drying foods
or drinks. Fish, cheese, ham and eggs, nearly
all pulse foods such as peas and beans, and
all greasy foods must be shunned. If you
have a delicate digestion lettuce, cabbage, etc.,
must be included in the ban. Melba would
take eggs in the form of an omelette, but
if it contained a particle of salt it would be
summarily rejected. When biding your turn
control your nerves by breathing deeply and
regularly.
What was Australia’s national wealth in
1929 ? What were the chief forms of wealth ?
—3671.
Estimated at £3,351,463,000. Chief items:
Land and improvements, £2,251.077,000; live-
stock, £194.045.000; manufacturing plant and
machinery, £117,572,000; locally manufactured
products, £133,466,000; and agricultural and
pastoral products, £108,470,000.
Origin and meaning of the word “posh” ?
—3700.
It originated among Anglo-Indians travelling
to and from England on furlough. The best
positions for cabins in the tropical runs were
port-side outward, and starboard-side home—
p.o.s.h. A “posh” cabin was one which ful-
filled the above conditions, and the term was
used generally to express superlative merit.
How to make bread, using brewer’s yeast ?
My difficulty is that l cannot get it to rise.
—3624.'
With fresh yeast and suitable treatment, the
bread is sure to rise. It must not be pounded
or over-handled to a tight mass, and must be
kept warm at all stages. Assemble 9 large
cups of dry, good flour, 1 tablespoon salt, 1
cup yeast and lukewarm water to make a
dough. Mix well and allow to stand for a
few hours in a warm place. When it breaks
on top knead it lightly but thoroughly with
a dusting of flour, cut in portions and place
in tins to rise again in a warm place (about
f-hour will do). Bake then in a fairly hot
oven for about 1 hour. Make half the quan-
tity for a trial and note results.
I am jackeroo on a Queensland station. I’ve
been a little over two years on the place. What
wages am I entitled to under the Station Hands’
Award? Must I belong to the A.W.U. ? —3722.
As you have just completed your second
year’s experience, you are entitled to £2 per
week, with keep. Under the award you must
be a member of the A.W.U.
(1) Where was coal gas first used as an
illuminant ? (2) When was it in general use in
London, Paris and New York ? —3745.
(1) Its practical value was first demonstrated
by William Murdock, a Scot, who in 1792 con-
structed apparatus by which he lighted his
house in Redruth, Cornwall. In 1798 he moved
to Soho and introduced the illuminant in a
foundry there, and in 1805 he introduced gas
in the Manchester cotton mills. (2) In 1810,
Winsor, “the father of modern gas lighting,”
secured the incorporation of the Gas Light and
Coke Company. Westminster Bridge was first
lighted by gas in 1813, the Guildhall in 1815,
Paris in 1820, and New York gradually be-
tween 1823 and 1827.
(1) What nation was responsible for the
foundations of astronomy ? (2) Was much
known about the heavens in ancient times ? —•
3748.-
The Chinese, Hindus, Chaldeans and Egyp-
tians observed and studied the heavens long
before the Christian era, but it is uncertain to
which of these nations priority should be given.
The Chinese have astronomical annals which
are claimed to go back to 2857 b.c., recording
comets and solar eclipses. (2) In the reign
of the Emperor Yao, 2300 b.c., professional
astronomers were compelled, under pain of
death, to predict solar eclipses so that ,steps
might be taken to propitiate the dragon which
was supposed to devour the sun. At an early
period the Chinese fixed the length of the year
at 365£ days. Pythagoras (sixth century b.c.)
taught that the earth was spherical and ex-
plained the phases of the moon.
(1) Who was the inventor of the electric
incandescent lamp ? (2) When was the first
successful lamp made ? (3) What was the fila-
ment composed of ? —3664.
(1) Many inventors attacked the problem—
F. de Molyens in 1841, J. W. Starr in 1845,
W. E. Staite in 1848 and J. Watson in 1853,
none of whom succeeded in making a practically
useful lamp. The problem was finally solved
by Edison and Swan. (2) Sir Joseph Swan
made a successful lamp in 1878, and exhibited
it at Newcastle (England) on December 19,
1878. (3) Swan’s early lamp employed a piece
of carbon in the form of a slender rod held by
clips attached to wires sealed through the walls
of an exhausted glass bulb. Edison gave the
filament a filamentary form and then carbon-
ised it.
(1) Does hard work stunt a person’s growth ?
(2) If not, how could I increase my height a
few inches? (3) Could a working man put on
most weight by eating five light meals a day
or three heavy ones ? —3598.
(1) No. (2) There is no certain method of
increasing adult height. Physical culture stimu-
lates the growth of articulation cartilages, but
bone-constructive processes are practically dor-
mant after maturity. (3), Light digestible meals
are best assimilated. For weight increase the
prescribed routine includes fats, sugar and
starchy foods, also cod-liver oil and malt
extract.
Treatment for dandruff ? —3600.
Rub warmed olive oil once weekly into the
hair roots overnight before shampooing, and
use a trace of the oil also as a dressing. Avoid
permanent waving for the present, brush scalp
and hair well daily, and singe tips of hair occa-
sionally. If trouble persists, substitute a pomade
of lOgr. each sulphur and salicyclic acid in
loz. yellow vaseline for the oil application
before shampooing. A lotion of equal parts
bay rum and castor oil may be used later.
(1) Does a chronic appendix or hcemorrhoids
have any effect in retarding the healing of a
duodenal ulcer ? (2) If so, would it be advis-
able to have appendix and hcemorrhoids re-
moved ? —3521.
(1) Yes. (2) Chronic appendix inflammation
aggravates the inflammatory process. This in-
volves any area of the intestinal tract, and the
duodenum could be involved. • Hamiorrhoids
of ordinary type are not of consequence, but
removal with the appendix might be deemed
advisable. It is a matter for medical advice
after diagnosis.
My hair is dry and lifeless. Treatment ?
—3674.
Use jaborandi oil. It .strengthens the hair
and gives a gloss. Keep scalp clean (soap
must be the best) and give your hair sunshine
and fresh air. Brush every night, after using
a very little of the oil, with long even strokes
of the brush, being careful not to irritate
die scalp. If the skin here is delicate, rub the
oil into the roots of the hair with your fingers,
not with the brush. Then brush lightly. You
can purchase the oil from most chemists.
' Can you tell me something about physiog-
nomy, and recommend books to study ? —3685.
Physiognomy (not to be confused with
phrenology) is the study of the whole surface
of the human frame. At present it is more an
art than a science. See the works by. Dr.
Katharine Blackford and her husband, Arthur
Newcomb, for modern views on the subject,
particularly those relating to vocational selec-
tion and guidance. The best lines of study lie
in the works of biologists and craniologists.
Darwin, Schopenhauer and Montessori have
made contributions on the subject.
(1) Under what conditions are bookmakers'
licenses issued in Brisbane ? (2) A pproximate
capital (including license fee) required to begin
operations ? —3547.
Applicants for metropolitan bookmakers’
licenses must appear in person before the com-
mittee of the Queensland Turf Club and pro-
duce a clearance if previously registered; if not,
satisfactory references. The yearly license fee
is £2l for all enclosures, with daily fielding fees
as follows: Paddock, £7 75.; St. Leger, £4 45.;
Flat, £3 3s. (2) Applicants are required to
have at least £750 for the Paddock, and £350
for the St. Leger or Flat.
How to make furniture-cream ?—3656.
Ammonia (88 liquid), 4 drams; yellow wax,
8oz.; turpentine, 16oz. (fluid); water, 16oz.
(fluid). Melt the wax by heating it in a pan
with the water, and then add the ammonia arid
turpentine. Stir the mixture well until it cools,
when it can be thinned down with water. To
use, apply a little on cheesecloth, and rub well
with another piece of dry, clean, soft cloth.
(1) Particulars of chromium plating? (2)
Essential parts of the plant? (3) Power re-
quired ? (4) Cost of installation and staff re-
quired ? —3657.
(1) The work is* carried out by the electro-
lytic process, using an electrolyte of pure
.chromic acid, pure sulphuric acid and water.
Anodes should be of antimonial lead. The
current density varies a great deal, according
to the type and class of work being treated.
For general purposes it is between 85 and 95
amperes to the square foot used in conjunction
with the “strike.” The time taken may be
from" 3 to 5 minutes for a cheap job, or
about 10 minutes when a good coat is neces-
sary. See “Chromium Plating,” by E. Rich-
ards, published by Charles Griffin, London.
(2) A D.C. generator supplying 1500 to 2000
amperes at 10 to 12 volts is ample for most
purposes; a chromium vat; first swill; soda
swill; cojd-.water swill; wiring-up and unwiring
benches. (3) A.C, or' D.C. supply, or an
engine if no supply is available. (4) Depends
upon the scale on which the work is to be
carried out.

The Press Secretary of the British Phreno-
logical Society. London, writes protesting that
the reply to 1966 (B. 20/6/’34), in which it was
stated that phrenology is not an accepted
science, does not fairly state the position. He
claims that many eminent scientists, among them
Lord Salverson, Sir J. Crichton Browne, Sir
Arthur Keith, Profs. J. S. Bolton, J. C. Brash,
J. Y. Simpson, D. K. Henderson, Elliot H.
Smith, Cyril Burt and Karl Pearson, and Drs.
Hamilton Marr and Bernard Hollander regard
phrenology as an exact science and have con-
tributed to its development.

“Pawang”: A movement is afoot in
Melbourne to improve the artistic quality
of the cemeteries. A similar movement
in England aims at encouraging bereaved
persons to use the beautiful English
stones and British architects, sculptors
and designers, instead of importing hor-
rors from the Continent. There was
great activity in Milan (Italy) at the end
of last century in this connection. Patri-
otic citizens began to take a greater in-
terest in their cemetery than in the
museums of Renaissance painting. The
best sculptors were commissioned and
immense sums were spent, resulting in
a more amazing collection of monumen-
tal monstrosities than can be seen any-
where, except, perhaps, in some modern
Hindu temples. The thing that had been
forgotten was the normal human passion
for going one better than one’s neighbor.
The sculptors were more interested in
making money than in producing master-
pieces of plastic beauty. If the move-
ment takes a grip of Melbourne it will
have to be subject to the direction of
some sort of expert committee or there
will be less art than industry about it.

“Ochone” on two Irish families:
The family of the late Marquess of Water-
ford (killed in a shooting accident at 32) has
certainly been long enough in Ireland to acquire
the curse which is supposed to rest on it
and through which three holders of the title out
of seven are declared to have died violent
deaths. On both sides, the Marquess was
descended from the very earliest Norman
colonists of Erin. He inherited the titles of
the De la Poers—one of them was Governor
of Ireland in 1179—and of the Beresfords —
Lord Beresford of Alexandria fame was brother
to the sth Marquess. His mother was a
daughter of the Marquess of Lansdowne, and
her family, the Fitzmaurices, though Ireland
still looks on them as interlopers, have been
Lords of Kerry and Lixnaw since 1172. One of
their scions, an Earl of Shelburne, became Prime
Minister of Britain, and another, the last Lans-
downe Marquess, would have been if he had
not been in the Upper House. The Lansdownes
don’t have much bad luck, especially the
females. One daughter of the sth Marquess—
remarried mother of the just-dead Waterford—
became Duchess of St. Albans a few days
before her son was killed, and another is
Duchess of Devonshire.

BETTER PERFORMANCE AT LESS COST.
TUNING HINTS FOR THE OWNER-DRIVER.
BY FRED BERRY.
IN the history of most cars there comes a time when, by reason
-*■ of its owner’s regular payments of hard cash for petrol,
fuel economy becomes a subject of importance. Means of
attaining that economy are here discussed.
Getting value for every shilling in the pound on the fuel
bill is a somewhat complicated business in which both personal
and mechanical aspects must be taken into consideration. There
are some motorists, blessed with more than average mechanical
sense, who obtain greater economy than their fellows purely
through intelligent driving. Their temperament impels them
to habits which lead to economy, but which would seem so much
wasted effort to a less sympathetic driver.
Were it possible to utilise the whole
of the energy in fuel fed to the car-
burettor, a modern sedan would cover
100 miles to the gallon of petrol, but,
unfortunately, only about 25 p.c. is
available as power at the road wheels.
This huge waste is accounted for by
heat lost in the exhaust gas (40 p.c.), in
the cooling water (28 p.c.) and in over-
coming mechanical and friction losses in
the machine itself (7 p.c. to 10 p.c.).
Therefore, in any plan of fuel economy
the objects must be to reduce heat losses
by increasing working temperature ; to re-
duce friction wherever possible ; to main-
tain the motor in good mechanical con-
dition, with carburettor and ignition skil-
fully adjusted, and to drive the car in-
telligently.
Dealing first with heat losses, some
benefit will be derived by careful con-
trol of water temperature, as most cars
are grossly overcooled. The most effi-
cient operating temperature is between
180 and 190 degrees Fahr., but to main-
tain this figure for normal driving would
leave but a narrow safety margin when
on full throttle for long periods or driv-
ing in hilly country.
Thermostat in pipe from radiator to
cylinder Block controls working tempera-
ture. This unit can be dismantled and
adjusted to give higher values.
Where adjustable thermostatic control
is fitted in the cooling system no diffi-
culty will be experienced in making ad-
justments to suit any particular load or
conditions, but where temperature con-
trol is fixed one can merely make a com-
promise by adjusting the pitch of fan
blades to bring the normal working tem-
perature up to, say, 170 deg. In some
cases the thermostat unit can be dis-
mantled, and by increasing the tension of
the release valve working temperature
can be raised.
With regard to friction losses, the most
prolific source of these is binding or
poorly-adjusted brakes. Make quite sure
that brake shoes are free when the pedal
is in normal position. In a lesser degree

properties.
Tran s mis-
sion alignment
and wheel bal-
ance must also
be given con-
sideration if
there is anything astray here it may
mean a prodigal waste of power. As a
practical example of the dangers of mis-
alignment a personal experience may be
related. Driving an 85 m.p.h. racing-car
in a race the speedometer stuck at 70,
though the throttle was full open. At
the same time a terrific vibration was set
up in the machine, shaking instruments
from the dashboard and so affecting my
vision as to force me to pull up. Subse-
quent investigation showed the tail shaft
to be one-sixteenth inch out of align-
ment. The symptoms would not be so
alarming at a modest touring sneed, but
petrol consumption would possibly be
increased by 10 p.c.
Testing Balance.
Wheel balance is equally important,
and it is seldom that a little time spent
on this adjustment will not be richly re-
warded. Deal with each wheel separ-
ately. Jack up, spin by hand and note
the position in which the tyre stops in
relation to the ground. If on the next
spin the wheel stops in exactly the same
place, wind a strip of sheet lead on the
spoke on the opposite side as near the
rim as possible. Continue this process
until finally the wheel will not come to
rest in the same position on two con-
secutive spins.
Having eliminated friction losses, re-
stored balance and checked alignment,
let us now set about getting best resuiu
from the engine. Our object is to ensure
burning the greatest weight of gas, with
a minimum of loss, on each power stoke ;
consequently the first job will be to see
that the motor is gastight.
It must be clear that with poor com-
pression even in one cylinder the
cost per mile of running must be in-
creased, all-round performance lowered
and the development of subsidiary faults
encouraged. Information can be ob-

English and Continental motors, in-
dicating the adjustments essential to
economy and best performance.
tained if the ear is placed near the crank-
case breather while the engine is being
cranked, for then one will determine
whether one or more cylinders are
“dud,” whether compression is equal in
all, and whether gas is blowing past the
rings in any or all cylinders. In the event
of compression loss
being detected the
defect must be recti-
fied before attempt-
ing further tuning,
as it is useless ex-
pecting the carburet-
tor to compensate
for such losses.
Where the car is
comparatively new—
say up to 20,000
miles —valve grind-
ing and fitting of
new rings will usu-
ally set faulty com-
pression right, but in
older machines, with
cylinder bores worn
badly, reboring or
relining is the only
safe course.
Air leaks in the in-
duction system must
now be searched for,
as the final adjust-
ment of the carbu-
rettor will depend in
a great measure up-
on the overall tight-
ness of these units.
See that valve stems
are a neat fit in the
guides and that the gaskets between in-
take pipe and carburettor and between
intake manifold and cylinders are fitting
perfectly and free from cracks.
Tuning Up.
Finally, there is the important opera-
tion of tuning the carburettor.
Theoretically, once having arrived at a
suitable setting on some standard grade
of fuel there should be no further neces-
sity for experiment, but in practice ex-
perience teaches that almost every such
instrument can be altered to give better
results than when first delivered from
the makers. It can safely be said that
nine out of every ten cars in use to-day
are being operated on an over-rich mix-
ture. Wnen the car was first on the road
the fuel adjustment was of necessity
rich in order to avoid stall-
ing the engine while it was
still stiff and new. After
running one or two thou-
sand miles all reciprocat-
ing parts within the motor
have been freed to such an
extent that a much leaner
mixture would serve for
normal driving, with con-
sequent economy of fuel.
Before making alterations
or adjustments one should
comprehend the purpose of
the carburettor, which,
briefly, is to atomise liquid
fuel and mix it intimately
with a definite volume of
air. The first important point is to deter-
mine the correct level of the fuel in the
float chamber, as this in turn governs the
height of petrol in the main or power
jet. Obviously this critical adjustment
cannot be made by motorists who are
haphazard in their selection of fuels, for,
as fuels vary in specific gravity or den-
sity, a correct adjustment for one may be
altogether astray for another. Careful
motorists will strictly adhere to the fuel
on which the setting is made. Assuming
that, the next experiment will be an en-
deavor to select the most suitable power
jet or combination of jets, and to fix the
idling position.
As standard carburettors vary so
greatly in type and design it would be

wherein by trial and error on the road
or by using the Heenan and Froude
testing machine the best combination
for the owner’s particular requirements
may be determined ; secondly, those in-
corporating fixed jets, in which case im-
provement is rather more of a problem.

Will Compression-ignition Engines
Replace Petrol Motors?
Huge Savings Effected in Fuel Costs.
The internal-combustion engine as
applied to automobiles has during the
past 30 years been considerably improved
in combustion-chamber design and over-
all efficiency, but there has been no
change in principle. Over this period
the cleverest brains have been seeking
ways and means of producing an engine
that will give a satisfactory power output
and yet at the same time be more eco-
nomical in fuel consumption.
It is apparent to any keen student of
motoring that the weakness of the
modern car, regardless of price or size,
lies not in the motor, for that is almost
mechanically perfect, but in the electrical
equipment, such as spark-plugs, ignition
coils, magnetos, generators, batteries,
etc., and also in a lesser degree to car-
burettor and induction systems. Usually
when a compulsory road stop is made
it will be found that one of the units
enumerated is responsible for the trouble,
and as a result the compression-ignition
system (loosely termed Diesel) is now
forcing its way to recognition by auto-
mobile engineers.
For many years these C.I. engines
have given satisfactory service in
ocean-going vessels and in other
heavy-duty power-plants where weight
is of little importance ; but these earlier
types were at once too bulky and heavy
to operate efficiently in cars. Recent
experiments have considerably altered
the position, and as a consequence C.I.
motors of various makes and types have
been developed which give power-to-
weight results, together with flexibility,
almost on a par with those of conven-
tional petrol motors, and, as crude oil
is used as fuel, operating costs have been
reduced to an extraordinary degree.
Comparing electrically-ignited and C.I.
motors, the latter seem to possess many
advantages. The C.I. engine eliminates
the possibility of breakdown due to
plugs, ignition valves or carburettor,
for these components are not used in
the assembly. And, as crude oil is used,
the fire hazard is also absent. The gas
mixture is exploded, not by an electric
spark, but by the heat generated at ex-
tremely high compression pressures.
Carburettor and valves are superfluous,
for the charge of crude oil is forced into
the combustion chamber by a pump. It
enters the cylinder at a moment when the
rising piston has heated the air inside by
high compression, so that an immediate
and powerful explosion of the mixture
follows.
Now that the Minister for Customs
has decided to admit all compression-
ignition engines for use in transport and
rail-car work duty free, Australian
fleet owners will be given an opportunity
of making enormous reductions in their
operating costs. As an illustration of
the possibilities in this direction an Eng-
lish transport co. has published data con-
cerning two otherwise identical vehicles
—one engined with a Gardiner C.I.
motor and one with a conventional
petrol engine, both doing similar work.
Fuel bill for the C.1.-engined vehicle
over 50,000 miles, with oil at Bd. per gal-
lon, totalled £lB9, while petrol at Is. 2d.
per gallon for the conventional motor
cost £622 for a similar distance. A further-
interesting feature was that on dis-
mantling the C.I. motor after 60,000
miles the only replacement needed was
a new set of oversized rings and a re-
facing of seatings, the wear generally
being of a minor nature and the engine
apparently good for further lengthy
service.
Motor Oddities.
“Dead Finish”: A trailer drawn be-
hind motor-lorries hauling wool is a
customary sight nowadays in the wool
centres. The “pup,” as it is generally
termed, is usually made from the rear
carriage of the old model-T Ford. The
chassis is cut off at a suitable length
and a cross-member is inserted if none
should be there. The pinion is removed
with the propeller-shaft housing, and any
old sort of cap is fitted to hold grease
in. A single pole, similar to the old
bullocky pole, is bolted down cross-
members, and to this the torque rods arc
fastened. The pole is made fast behind

For easy loading an excavation is made

“T.G.8.”: The homely
spud has kept many a car
going. Motoring between
Dubbo and Gilgandra (N.S.W.) in 1910
a raw stretch of corduroy caused a frac-
ture of the petrol pipe. A roadside
repair looked hopeless until I had a
brain-wave. Near by was a house, luckily,
so I asked the boss for a couple of
potatoes. With a rat-tail tile I bored a
hole, approximately the diameter of the
broken pipe lengthwise through the
vegetable. Inserting the broken ends of
the pipe in the hole with strips of rag
and much copper wire effected a repair
that carried me to Coonamble. Scraps
of raw spud choked the needle valve
every now and then, but that was better
than a total hold-up.
* * * *
“Jo”: Two N.S.W. women had rather
a thrilling ride from Eungeila to Murwil-
lumbah recently. The seat of their car
commenced to heave in rather a peculiar
way. They halted for investigation, and
on lifting the seat were astonished to find
a huge carpet-snake under the upholstery :
springs, which were pinching the reptile.
However, the reptile appeared very
friendly once the seat was removed, and
soon settled down for a siesta. Then
a passing male motorist came to the
rescue, and the serpent was quickly
dispatched.
The Trouble Lamp.
Old Car (N.S.W.). —(1) Can jets be changed
in the Solex carburettor ? (2) Where can I get
Solex instruction hook ? (3) What petrol con-
sumption should be obtained with a 1926
Oldsmobile ? (4) My car has an “extra-air”
attachment. Is it of any use ?
(1) Yes. (2) Bradley Bros., Wentworth-
avenue, Sydney. (3) 18 to 20 m.p.g. (4) Not
if the carburettor is correctly tuned, but look
out for air-leaks in old fittings.
S.J.M. (Drummoyne, N.S.W.). —The oil pump
in my 1928 Erskine has been playing tricks, the
pressure gauge falling back to zero when turning
corners. Should I use a thicker oil ?
Don’t think change of oil will help or that
pump is at fault. Probably union of main oil-
pipe branch within the sump is cracked, form-
ing an air bell in the line. On taking a
corner the oil swirls to one side and leaves
the broken section exposed.
H.J.C. (Footscray, Vic.). —You recommended
upper-cylinder lubrication for easy starting, etc.
( B. 15 /8 / ’34). (1) Could it be supplied through
petrol or by some attachment ? (2) Is the
Como lubricator efficient ?
Either Como or NuJay upper-cylinder lubri-
cators are far more effective than when oil
is added to fuel. Furthermore, oil used in
these lubricators is specially made for the
purpose and is different from crankcase oil.
J.L. (Epping, N.S.W.). —(1) In accounts of
trial runs of cars you give exact quantities
of petrol used. How is this arrived at ? (2)
The carbon contacts in my distributor head are
partly worn, and the bakelite at each contact
is burned. Should a spark appear at these
points or only at the broker gap ?
(1) Where filler pipe allows the fuel tank
to be filled to capacity the exact amount re-
MOTORIMPRESSIONS—BOILING.
quired to replenish the tank is measured at the
conclusion of the test. Where the filler cap
is sharply bent or the drain hole is made at
the junction of pipe and tank, a measured
quantity in excess of requirements is placed in
the tank t and the residue measured after the
test. (2) Wear of contacts is not important.
There should be no sparking in distributor head
if the condenser is in perfect condition.
S.McN. (Burnie, Tas.). —My 1934 car has
now done 4000 miles, but the hand-operated
spark control seems to be of no use. When
pulled out the car seems to labor and slow up.
Can it be altered, or is it merely an ornament ?
Evidently the ignition point is much too
far retarded for normal running. Hand con-
trol, to be effective, should be in retarded
position, except when driving at speed. To alter,
put in the starting handle, take off the cover
of the distributor and turn the motor until the
make-and-break points are fully open. Next
slack off the lock-nut on the distributor-head
spindle and turn the head against the direction
of rotation until the points close. Lock up
the nut and you will find the engine much

S.B. (Cawongla, N.S.W.). —/ have had new
pistons and rings fitted to my 18,000- mile-old
car, and am alarmed at greatlv increased oil
consumption and constant smell of oil fumes
when driving. Plugs are quite clean and free
from oil, and there is little smoke from ex-
haust. The car pulls perfectly.
Better compression may be causing oil to
pump through worn valve guides or badly-
fitting gaskets in the sump, or the valve cover
plate may be responsible for loss.
D.M.C. (Colwell, Vic.). —Since putting in a
new front member in my ton truck a bad
wheel-wobble has developed. Measurements
have been checked and found correct. What is
the trouble ?
Badly worn king pins or bent steering arm
may cause the wobble, but unless measurements
of toe-in and camber were made with special
instruments it is more than likely the front-
end geometry is astray.
.1.G.8. (Ipswich, Q.). —Can you give me
information regarding the stability, etc., of the
Big Six Nash sedan.
There can be no doubts as to stability of this
car, but as it has not yet been tested officially
over The Bulletin course detailed information
for purposes of comparison cannot be supplied.
Silvani (Glenclg, S.A.). —(1) What benefits
would be derived from fitting a Silvani type
cylinder head to my 1925 501 Fiat, and what
would be approximate increase in maximum
speed ? (2) If fitted, should back-axle ratio be
increased from 5.1-m-l to 4.5 -to-l ?
(1) Horse-power output would be slightly
increased and maximum speed possibly lifted by
5 to 5 m.p.h. But as the engine was. not
designed for high performance you would be
ill-advised to make the change, as mechanical
trouble of a more or less serious nature is
almost sure to follow. (2) No.
N.E.W. (W. Maitland, N.S.W.).—/ have
been having ignition trouble. My car is
difficult to start, runs fairly well at moderate
speeds and begins to miss at high speed. Flag
points have been set to 10 thou, in trying
to cure the ntiss. Make-and-break points are
18 thou. Can you suggest a remedy?
In coil-and-battery ignition thp gap at plug
points must invariably be greater than at
make-and-break. Standard setting for your
car is plug gap 18 thou., make-and-break
12 thou. Try this.

SHORT-WAVE PROS AND CONS.
(No. 1)
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Short-wave working is based on the same principles as broadcast
( medium-wave ) reception, but there are many special problems to be
solved when tuning is done in the short-wave bands. These problems
are of a practical nature, and must be mastered before designing a short-
wave receiver.
Importance of the Aerial.
Short waves are very much in the
public eye these days. Should some im-
portant function occur within the British
Empire, an Empire-wide broadcast is
arranged, and either by local retransmis-
sion on the broadcast band or reception
direct Britishers everywhere are able to
hear and visualise the distant ceremony,
it has just been done in the case of the
giant Cunarder launched on Clydebank
by the Queen. Those possessing means
of short-wave reception were able to
hear with notable clarity almost every
spoken word, and even the million and
one sounds made by the gigantic hull on
its descent to the river. Rebroadcast by
local stations is admirable when it can fit
into the picture ; but, when the time of
an overseas short-wave transmission coin-
cides with an hour when local stations
are normally closed and most people
retired for the night, the short-wave re-
ceiver in the home provides the link. It
does this only if it is able to do its work
well. It is not'enough to build or pur-
chase a receiver capable of a good per-
formance and connect it to a picture-rail
aerial. The finest of all-wave superhetero-
dyne models will fall flat on the short-
wave side under such conditions.
If a powerful superhet will give only
a poor showing when thus handicapped,
it follows that the small home-made re-
generative receiver cannot be expected
to do any better. A good aerial must be
used for short-wave reception if good
results are expected. This means some-
thing externally placed, well elevated and
insulated, and possibly filtered for radio-
inductive interference elimination. With
an efficient aerial, the small receiver will
do just as much in proportion as the ex-
pensive superhet, even though the results

are only via headphones. There are ad-
vantages in headphones. They do not,
like a loudspeaker, arouse domestic
wrath in the silence of the night.

Small Receivers Popular with
Constructors.
Correspondence, shows that to-day the
number of enthusiasts making and using
short-wave receivers of the regenerative
detector and audio-amplifier kind, bat-
tery- or electrically-operated, is much
greater than was the case a few years
ago. Apart from the vast improvement
in quality and number of stations
working on short waves, valves have ad-
vanced in design so much that astonish-
ing results can be obtained with a re-
ceiver of humble pretensions. An
example of a modern regenerative short-
wave receiver is the Wide-World Two
(B. 15/8/’34). This is a remarkably
simple receiver to make and put into
operation, but, like all other short-
wavers, it can be refractory if incor-
rectly made.
Basis of the Receiver.
The heart of the regenerative tuner is
its coil and tuning condenser combina-
tion.
If the variable condenser is of poor
quality,.and particularly if the bearings
are loose, with end-play in the rotor
shaft, precision of tuning will be either
extremely difficult or next to impossible.
The coil plays a very important part.
Although the winding of a few turns of
wire on a specified diameter may result
in a workable coil, the coil will be much
more efficient if made as “low-loss” as
possible. Many experimenters use dis-
carded valve bases for coil formers.
These may or may not be suitable, and
the writer has found cases where a coil
wound on a valve base would not permit
oscillation of the detector valve ; and yet
when a similar coil on another valve base
was used no trouble was evident. This is
due to the fact that in recent years not
all valve bases have been made of per-
fect insulating composition. Some were
made of bakelite ; others of something
akin to moulded mud. The moral is to
use the specially-designed ribbed coil
formers; or, if the constructor has no
objection to bulkiness, the old-fashioned
“air-wound” heavy-gauge basket-weave
coil will ensure
“low-loss” in its
entirety.
Then there is the
question of plug-in
mountings. Any
old valve socket
will not do. The
modern moulded
type, preferably of
isolantite, is advis-
able. Colville
Wireless Equip-
ment Co., Sydney,
stocks isolantite
sockets.
Earth-capacity
Effect.
The writer has
in the last eight
years received hun-
dreds of letters
complaining o f
“hand-capacity” trouble, with accom-
panying detuning, in home-made short-
wave receivers. On anything approaching
a well-designed receiver, movements of
the hand and body near the receiver
shoul d have little or no effect on the
tuning. With a badly-arranged receiver,
a movement of only an inch, with the
hand a foot or so away from a coil, may
result in complete detuning. This is
simply explained. The human body is
a conductor, and, while the lower end
of the coil is connected to the earth, the
upper is not. There is a slight capacity
between the hand and the top of the
coil. This capacity may be removed by
using a metal panel
for the controls,
with the panel
earthed. The metal
panel may appear
to add further to
the trouble, but as
it is in a fixed posi-
tion its capacity-to-
earth effect on the
coil is constant,
and does not vary.
Radio Frequency
Chokes.
A frequent cause
of “tuning holes”
in short-wave re-
ceivers is the use
of unsuitable R.F.
chokes. If a choke
is suspected it is easy to plot a curve
showing the effectiveness at different fre-
quencies. Every choke has its own natural
frequency, but this is designed to fall out-
side the tuning range for which it is
intended. General purpose chokes in-
tended for broadcast frequencies arc
not altogether suitable. The safest plan
is to use the three-section honeycomb-
type (R.C.S. Radio). This is effective
at peaks falling in 'the important inter-
national channels, and the total induc-

in these National ( U.S.A .) products. They are, respectively,

and a four-pin valve socket.
tance of the three sections places the
natural period well clear of the short
waves.
D. B.K.
ABOUT SONG HITS.
It was never very easy to avoid con-
tact with song hits. In the era before
the gramophone and radio such airs
were impressed upon the citizenry by
barrel organs and the butcher’s boy and
by Ella (aged seven), who practised them
for hours, by ear, on a strident piano.
The only difference nowadays is that the
impact is harder and fiercer, the repeti-
tion is raised to the nth power, and the
death of the favorite comes sooner.
A subject that has never received ade-
quate attention from philosophers is the
extent to which familiarity with music
breeds affection. That it does so was
very well understood by the composers
of a bygone age. Having found an effec-
tive phrase, they repeated it in one com-
position so often that the listener was
simply forced to “learn” it. Having got
to the stage at which he could remember
it, he was so pleased with his achieve-
ment that he attributed to its cause vir-
tues that perhaps had no existence. It
is ever so much more easy for most of
us to remember a tune than to remember
a poem or a passage in prose, and that
is mainly because every tune consists
of oft-repeated phrases. Literature, on
this ground, may be given a higher pedes-
tal than music, if one doesn’t mind com-
paring strawberries and oysters.
But let us get back to the subject. The
most reliable formula for the song hit
was evolved and practised by Moody,
Sankey’s partner. Moody made the
range small, so that all could sing; he
used mostly the notes that sound best
and can be sung with ease ; he made the
tune simple and lugubrious, following in
that respect .Stephen Foster, a fellow-
American, whose “Swanee River” and
kindred ditties are known to all the
world. It has frequently been alleged
that both Foster and Moody got their
mournful strains from the African
negroes, but that may be doubted. The
nigger has no monopoly of a love for
wallowing in gloom.
A fair amount of skill is required to
build a tune out of the most-easily-sung
notes, and outstanding 1 talent in that
direction is rare. Irving Berlin has it;
Puccini has provided some notable ex-
amples. The most difficult thing of all
is to evolve a tune that will stand a
thousand repetitions without killing itself'
deader than a doornail. That is why
so many writers of song hits fall back
on established successes. “The Old Spin-
ning Wheel,” which holds the air at time
of writing (it may be dead before this
gets into print), is a revamp of “The
Prisoner’s Song,” and, like that opus,
traces back to a well-known hymn. Note
its structure. Eleven notes; the same
phrase shortened to eight notes, with a
slightly different tail; the first 11 notes
repeated ; the second line repeated, with
the exception that it ends on the key-
note. Most long-lived popular songs are
very much like that. Those that have a
march, waltz or gavotte theme have to
stand sooner or later on their merits as
march, waltz or gavotte, and there’s a
dickens of a lot of competition in those
three divisions.
A habit that persists among the song-
hit composers of the day is cribbing from
the classics. A ballad frequently on the
air of late commences note for note
the same as a Mendelssohn “Song With-
out Words,” usually dubbed “Consola-
tion.” A more robust thief has taken
Schumann’s “Merry Peasant” holus-
bolus and wedded it to a ditty with the
refrain “The Elephant Never Forgets.”
Admiration still wells up at the ingenuity
of the lyricist who wedded the “Halle-
lujah Chorus” to an air from “Maritana”
for the purposes of a ballad about
bananas.
Such things can’t live. How much of
their ephemeral popularity was due to
radio repetition it is difficult to assess.
Equally difficult is it to assess the re-
sponsibilities of the radio entrepreneurs
in regard to the purveying of such trivi-
alities. A song is plugged through the
radio in Australia because it has a vogue
in the U.S.A. or in Britain; it has that
vogue because it has been radio-plugged
in those older countries and given f arther
publicity per gramophone record because
it was heard so much over the- air Even
the 8.8. C., which sets its aims high, and
which has no competition to fear from
advertising stations, includes song hits in
its programmes, though it does so spar-
ingly. In Australia the things are thrown
at the public with ruthless determination,
and so wearisome becomes the reitera-
tion that a Sydney announcer the other
afternoon, introducing a gramophone re-
cord of one of the current favorites, said,
“And now we’ll have a number that
hasn’t been heard very much lately,” and
he added in a tired voice, “at least not
in the last five minutes.”

Amateur Chatter.
With summer coming in the number
of VK ’phone stations using the 80-
metre band is thinning, and prolonged
bursts of heavy static drive the experi-
menter to more favorable regions. In
Sydney many of those who have camped
on 80 for months are now to be heard
on the 40-metre band in the evenings,
with various grades of telephony. Many
of the listening public equipped with
all-wave receivers will miss the out-
standing 80-metre men with their in-
formal Sunday evening round-table con-
ferences, operating over thousands of
miles, but they will be there again next
winter.
Those people fortunate enough to
be able to cover the short-wave bands
can realise, after a little concentration
on the amateurs, the fascination of ama-
teur transmission and why so many
young (and old) men spend so much
time handling a Morse key or a micro-
phone. A round-table telephony confer-
ence may include up to seven or ten
stations, and those stations may be
located —some in Sydney, some in Mel-
bourne, others in Queensland and in
Maoriland. The order of rotation is
chosen, and, following in this order, each
man has his say, with the other stations
listening and making notes. By tele-
graphic communication, and using the
higher frequency bands, 40 or 20 metres,
these multi-point contacts often take
place right around the world, and dis-
tance is little or no obstacle. Other
groups of amateurs concentrate on ultra-
high frequency experiments, and in
most populated parts of the world five-
metre telephony networks are in opera-
tion day and night.
At present, Australian amateurs are
concentrating on the coming Melbourne
centenary contest, for which some valu-
able prizes have been donated by promi-
nent radio organisations. During this con-
test, amateurs in all parts of the world
will strive to the utmost to communi-
cate with as many Australians as pos-
sible, and vice versa. Judging by early-
morning conditions on 40 metres at
present, Europeans will be well in evi-
dence during the contest, many English-
men being workable between 5 a.m. and
7 a.m., Sydney time.
On 10 metres a few stations may be
heard in Sydney preparing for the forth-
coming year-round test organised by the
Radio Society of Great Britain. Out-
standing is VK2LZ Crow’s Nest, N.S.W.,
whose telephony transmissions are heard
strongly at intervals. An interesting fea-
ture of the 10-metre signal from this
station is that it is much more powerful
than the 20-metre signal, with the same
transmitter and the same power. A hori-
zontal aerial is used for local tests and a
vertical aerial for DX. Others heard
strongly on 10 metres at the writer’s
station are VK’s 2SA, 2YC and 2ZI.
* * * *
“VK2NO”: John D. Olle, formerly
VK2OZ, now VPIZZ, out Fiji way,
is putting a strong signal into Syd-
ney on the 7mc. band when he
can keen the petrol engine turn-
ing the H.T. genny over. The place, he
claims, is a DX paradise, despite the
attentions of mosquitoes and other things
that hop, run, jump, bite and sting. The
following VK’s will be interested to learn
how their.signals are heard out there:
VK’s 2NY, 2NO, 3GO, 7BJ, 2AZ, 3LQ
at R max.; VK’s 20J, 2LX, 2XJ. 2YL,
2VQ, 7JB, 3GR, SXU, 2GO, SRH at RB.
These signals were logged between
7.40 p.m. and 8.20 p.m. Sydney time.
The transmitter at VPIZZ is a T.P.T.G.
using a DETI with 600 volts from gen-
erator supply.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
The swing to summer conditions is
becoming much more marked, and
around midnight quite a few stations on
the 31m. and 25m. bands have been at
excellent strength, with 19m. fair. The
week-end has been poor; hardly any-
thing worth listening to in the daylight
hours until the 8.8. C. came on the air
at 4.15 p.m. GSB, 31.5 m., was excellent,
but GSD, 25.5 m., was still only fair and
quickly dropped in strength to zero.
The Bombay station has been patchy,
and one night was off frequency and
interfering with DJA. RNE has been
excellent at midnight, and keeps going
for some hours now instead of closing
at 1 a.m. This station gradually drops
in strength. DJA is rapidly improving
after 11 p.m., but DJC, in the 49m. band,
weakens in the mornings. DJC and RFN
have been almost too weak to copy at
6.30 a.m.
The new 2RO transmitter has not yet
been heard testing,* ■ nor has PHI moved
up to the 25m. band from 16.8 m. From
announcements from WBXK some time
back, the schedule of PHI has been
extended.
Some of the questions and answers
from RNE are interesting, and the
authorities are getting some very hostile
criticism.
Of the amateur bands, 80 metres has
been very patchy, and not so many sta-
tions have been heard, due, no doubt, to
seasonal conditions. The 20m. band
has been quite dead for DX, but at 4
p.m. on a recent Sunday quite a few
amateurs were putting over very good
quality music, four States being heard at
different times.
NIGHTOWL.
What’s What in Radio.
For many years the plain crystal-
oscillator circuit has provided the basic
means of frequency stabilisation for
radio transmitters for broadcasting and
short-wave purposes. For the latter, the
necessity for frequency doubling and
quadrupling has meant the use of several
stages of amplification following the
crystal-oscillator running at compara-
tively low frequency. The type-59 valve,
by virtue of its internal screening, re-
sulted in a crystal-oscillator using this
pentode and described as a “tritet.” In
this way, with an 80-metre crystal in the
cathode-control grid circuit, the plate
circuit may be tuned to 40 metres or 20
metres with appreciable harmonic out-
put. The latest is the application of the
type-53 Class-B valve in an arrangement
termed the Siamese Exciter, vide
“Radio” (U.S.A.). As the 53 is a twin-
valve, the title is appropriate.
* * * *
At a mass meeting of Swiss radio
amateurs resolutions were passed express-
ing satisfaction with the efforts of the
electrical authorities to eliminate man-
made static, and urging the immediate
enforcing of the law relating to inter-
ference offences of this type. The sooner
such interference becomes a subject for
legislation in Australia, the better for
all concerned in radio matters.
# * * *
“A.McE.” (Otago, M.L.) comments on
a statement (B. 8/ 8 /’34) that the 8.8. C.
does not issue verifications to listeners:
“This is misleading. A Verification can be
obtained from ‘World Radio,’ the
foreign and technical journal of the
8.8. C. I know, as I fluked London
National (260 metres) on medium wave,
and duly got a verification.” 8.8. C.
acknowledges reception reports thus by
printing the name and location of the lis-
tener in “World Radio,” but this method
cannot be compared with the goodwill
value of the QSL card. Other concerns
readily acknowledge by direct mail.
* * * *
The robot radio tuner is the latest
from America. Introduced by A. At-
water Kent, pioneer radio manufacturer,
14 different programmes can be pre-
selected over a 12-hour period on seven
stations with the mechanism, which is
located above the instrument panel of
the console receiver. Once set, the robot
dialler will switch from one station to
another at the precise moment without
further effort on the listener’s part.
Above the tuning dials appears the
face of an electric clock. Around the
rim of the clock are tiny holes, each re-
presenting the quarter-hour periods
which serve as the connecting links be-
tween the tuning mechanism and the
clock. The tuner has 16 outlets in the
form of miniature telephone switch-
board cords, two to each of seven sta-
tions, and providing for 14 different pro-
gramme periods, with two extra cords
for intermission periods. The listener,
in pre-selecting his programmes, plugs
the cords into the holes at the desired
programme periods and the machine then
operates automatically, shifting from
station to station, stopping itself and
starting again precisely as scheduled.
When the self-tuning mechanism is not
operating, the receiver is used like the
ordinary set.
# * * *
English radio journals dealing with the
Radiolympia Exhibition, held during
August, literally bristle with descriptions
of good things for the home-constructor
—improved iron-cored coil assemblies
with permeability adjustments for match-
ing coils, television kits and accessories,
midget-type valves and sockets, special
short-wave tuning condensers and coils,
and everything that the enthusiastic con-
structor could wish for. The home-con-
structor is by no means a back number
in Australia, but, unlike his English coun-
terpart, he is to-day in the position of
hunting the junk store for many com-
ponents the manufacturer does not pro-
duce. There are things in which the keen
constructor is interested other than
broadcast superheterodynes in kit form.

TORCHES REFILLS tr RADIO BATTERIES
“Bulletin” Test Review."
( Manufacturers’ products considered worthy of
attention are tested and reviewed in this
section.)
In putting an all-wave type of receiver
through its paces in the laboratory the
first step is to duplicate the conditions
under which the receiver is most likely
to be called upon to work. These con-
ditions include a receiving aerial of the
picture-rail variety, laid closely against
a wall, and anything but an ideal collec-
tor of energy. Whereas the receiver
may be capable of tuning-in all the local
broadcast stations between 200 and 550
metres with ample volume, the ineffi-
cient aerial usually tells a different story
on short waves.
A Slade Model 70 all-wave superhetero-
dyne tested under such adverse condi-
tions made a remarkably good showing.
Receiver.—Slade Model 70 all-wave
superheterodyne. Six valves and recti-
fier, 57, 56, 58, 58, 2A6, 2A5, and 80.
Uses Yaxley Switch.
Manufacturer. — Slade’s Radio, Lang-
street, Croydon, N.S.W. UJ4576.
At peak periods the overseas services—
Daventry, Paris and various transocean
radio-telephones—were well audible, with
a surprisingly favorable signal to noise-
level ratio. This receiver should there-
fore be particularly suitable for installa-
tion in flats or other locations where the
use of a good external aerial is a diffi-
culty. With a lengthy inside aerial,
spaced at least 6in. from walls, good
all-wave performance may be expected.
Used with a well-designed external-aerial
system this receiver leaves little to be
desired, and particularly noteworthy is
the excellent audio-tone balance, which
is augmented by a manual tone-control.
An important point about all-wavers
is the switching mechanism. The re-
ceiver can only be as good as its switch.
In this respect the engineers responsible
for the Slade Model 70 left nothing to
chance, and the carefully-designed Yax-
ley (U.S.A.) switch is used. The action
is smooth and easy, and contact un-
failing.
Tuning on all ranges is done by a fine-
ratio Aero-type dial, and, although this
is a little slow when covering from 200
to 550 metres, the ratio is a great advan-
tage on the shorter-wave channels be-
tween 13 and 50 metres. The broadcast
range at night, with a multitude of
stations well audible, shows a complete
absence of spurious whistles, and, with
the superfine quality delivered from the
2A5 pentode driven by a 2A6, broadcast
entertainment at its best is enjoyed.
In its piano-finished cabinet, attractive
and pleasing in appearance, the price of
£27 10s. makes available a fine production
at very reasonable cost.
Supplied with each receiver is an in-
struction booklet containing operating
information and a calibrated list of the
more important short-wave stations.
Apart from the complete receiver, this
model is of great interest to the home-
constructor, as Slade’s Radio has made
available the kit for duplication. This in-
cludes the Yaxley switch, three air-dielec-
tric I.F. transformers at 465 kc. and a
working blue-print, the complete kit
being priced at £5 ss. Further informa-
tion on Slade Model 70 or the kit is
available from the manufacturer: Slade’s
Radio, Lang-street, Croydon, N.S.W.
Casual Comment.
Broadcast DX hunters have another
station to include on the dials in Aus-
tralia. This is 4AY Ayr, North Queens-
land, styled “the Voice of the Cane-
fields.” Reports from Brisbane state
that this station is received strongly
there during tests, so there is little
reason why it should not show up on
receivers in Sydney occasionally. Syd
Colville, Sydney radio engineer, designed
and installed the transmitting equip-
ment, and Norman Dahl, of experimen-
tal stations VK2ND-4ND, is the boss of
the station.
The Q. and A. Column.
I am using a crystal receiver, and am getting
such excellent results that 1 would like to add
an amplifier to provide for loudspeaker volume.
Please illustrate a circuit. —147.
The idea that the 'crystal receiver is capable
of any better reproduction than a correctly-
designed valve receiver is wrong, and arises
merely from the use of headphones and a
comparatively weak signal A suitable arrange-
ment for valve amplification after the crystal
is illustrated. Any good audio transformer
will do, and the valve depends upon voltage and
current requirements. A PM2A or PM2O2 is
suggested. The speaker should, of course, be
ol the magnetic type. The fixed condenser
across the audio transformer primary is .00025
and the coupling condenser to the speaker 1 or
2 mfd. A 30-henry choke is used in the
plate circuit of the valve.
What European stations did I hear at 6.30
a.m. M.L. standard time on September 10,
1934 ? Approximate wave-lengths (frequencies
in kc.) are 600, 620, 640, 690, 735, 790, 800,
820, 825, 830, 840, 860, 880, 905, 910, 960,
1040, 1110, 1145, 1200, 1245. Some gave classi-
cal music, but mostly were on talks in German,
French and Italian. —145.
You must be living in a veritable long-distance
listener’s paradise! Identification is a matter
of conjecture really, but, taking the frequencies
from the latest list, they could have been:
609 kc., Florence, Italy, 20kw.; 620 kc., Cairo,
Egypt, 20kw.; 638 kc., Prague, Czecho-Slovakia,
120 kw.; 695 kc., Paris, P.T.T., 7kw.; 740 kc.,
Munich, Germany, lOOkw.; 785 kc., Leipzig,
Germany, 120 kw.; 804 kc., Scottish Regional,
50kw.; 823 kc., Bucharest, Roumania, I2kw.;
832 kc., Moscow, RV39, 100 kw.; 841 kc., Berlin,
Germany, 100 kw.; 859 kc., Strasbourg, P.T.T.,
France, 15kw.; 886 kc., Graz, Austria, 7kw..;
904 kc., Hamburg, Germany, 100 kw.; 913 kc.,
Toulouse, France, lOkw.; 959 kc., Post Parisien,
Paris, 100 kw.; 1040 kc., Leningrad, U.S.S.R.,
lOkw.; 1113 kc., Kosice, Czecho-Slovakia, 3kw.
(unlikely); 1149 kc., London National (Brook-
mans Park) or West National (Washford Cross),
synchronised on 50kw.; 1204 kc., Prague No. 2,
Czecho-Slovakia, skw.; 1249kc\, Nice, France,
2kw. (unlikely).

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Thirty-one thousand people were at
Randwick for the winding-up of a very
successful spring meeting. Only one thing
marred the pleasure of the public—the
paucity of successful favorites. Every-
thing went well for the club except the
weather on Metrop. Day; and the com-
mittee takes these things philosophically.
Nightly ran so well in the Metropoli-
tan that 5 to 4 in a field of five (with
First Balloon one of them) seemed a
good price in the Randwick Plate, es-
pecially as he was meeting Topical and
Oro on better terms. He won with a
lot in hand from Oro, who showed little
determination when it came to racing
over the last two. furlongs. Lough Neagh
was third. Topical disappointed; he

appeared certain of a place at the turn,
but could not come on. Nightly is such
a good stayer that he must be given a
Melbourne Cup chance. Topical is to be
scratched.
Peter Pan’s stable-mate, Cid (5 to 1),
had the advantage of excellent horse-
manship on the part of Keith Cook in
the Chester Handicap. Cook allowed Le
Touquet, Misnomer, Multudo and Bim
Boy to fight for the lead ; when they had
run themselves to a standstill, Cid dashed
away at the Leger to win easily from
Raleigh and Capris. Bronze Hawk,
Tatyoon and Legislator were next. Each
of the trio may be worth following, par-
ticularly Tatyoon, who was almost
knocked over when trying to get to the
front a furlong from home. Raleigh was
in trouble more than once. He is a son
of Manfred and an improved horse.
King March’s victory in the Waverley
Handicap, at tens, compensated trainer
Jamieson for loss of Limarch’s services.
Confab essayed to lead all the way, but
King March had him beaten at the top
of the straight, and the Rossendale geld-
ing—who was bred here, but is owned in
M.L. —got home ahead of Satmoth and
Broccoli. The favorite, Mainlaw, was
beaten at the turn; Braeburn was an-
other to fail badly. Gippsland was
backed, but seems to have gone off a bit.
The two-year-olds were a pretty good
lot. M.L. sportsman G. F. Moore, who
won the V.R.C. Oaks v/ith Golden Hair,
was represented by Golden Promise, who
annexed the first division of the Canon-
bury at 20 to 1. A handsome colt by
Limond from the Absurd mare Lady
Bentinck, Golden Promise beat the hot
favorite,' Strathardale, and Whernside.
Whernside is owned hy W. R. Kemball,
who took the Gimcrack with Lady
Primrose. Queensland-owned and -trained
Buffer (7 to 2) had a runaway win in the
second division of the Canonbury. He is
by Bullhead from Petkin, by The Wel-
kin, and cost 150 guineas as a yearling.
Medallist and Wykeham ran a dead-heat
for second. Medallist was slow to leave
the barrier. He races in the colors of
W. T. Kerr, timekeeper at most Sydney
race tracks.
Sylvandale, fourth in the Derby, was
saved for the Clibborn Stakes. He started
at 9 to 4, a price due to support for
Gladswood and Duke Caledon, and, tak-
ing charge at the Leger after King’s Head
and Bombus had made the pace, Miss
“Lorna Doone’s” colt won cleverly from
Barak, who finished in good style, with
Bombus third. Gladswood was sore
when doing his preliminary, and Darby
Munro was throwing everything at him
to get the Limond colt near the leaders
in the first five furlongs.
Closing Time was unluckily beaten in
the Final Handicap. Usually a smart
horse at the barrier, he was one of the
last to move, and Bartle didn’t let him
settle down. At the Leger the Tippler
horse looked a fair thing, but Lancaster
King (20 to 1), who is trained at
Menangle by the brothers Curry, came
with a fine burst and put the issue be-
yond doubt in the last half-furlong. Rox-
burgh ran a fair race to get third, and
Magnitas and Deputy Ruler, fourth and
fifth, should soon reward their stables if
shrewdly “placed.” Blixten cut up badly.
Stake-money amounted to £25,700.
Maoriland-bred horses had a good bite of
this with £13,705 —14 firsts, three seconds
and five thirds. Those owned in M.L.
earned £5425, Silver Ring’s win for A. H.
Walton in the Epsom (£1500) being the
largest contribution. Eight owners won
over £lOOO, the highest scorers being the
N.S.W. owners E. Moss and E. J. Watt.
The first-named collected £3BOO for
Theo’s win in the Derby, while the
Metrop. with' Waikare and a third in
the Grantham with Dromos brought in
£3025 for the second. McCarten topped
the winning jockeys with five wins, and
Williams, Price and J. King were first
among the trainers with three wins each.
* * * *
Youngsters raced at Flemington for the
first time this season in Victoria. Sire
honors went to the St. Albans stud, at
Geelong, where Great Star (by Sunstar)
and Gay Lothario (by Gay Crusader) are
located. Matinee, who captured the
fillies’ division of the Maribyrong Trial
Stakes, is by Great Star from Beneficiary
(imp.), a granddaughter of Spearmint;
Gay Lover, winner of the race for colts
and geldings, is by Gay Lothario from
Violet Rays (by Great Star from Mauve,
imp.), a half-sister to Polycletan.
Romany Faith, who finished third in the
fillies’ section, also was foaled at St.
Albans. She is a sister to Gay Gipsy,
who beat Hyperion in the Karrakatta
Plate at Perth.
Matinee started a hot favorite, but
she had to be ridden right out by Frank
Dempsey to overhaul the pacemaker,
Merrily, and score by half a head. Fred
Hoysted, the Mentone trainer, races
Matinee in conjunction with F. W. Pel-
ham. She cost only 160gns. as a year-
ling, whereas 450gns. was paid for Gay
Lover, who ran the furlongs in
faster time than Matinee. Altogether
50 youngsters sported silk. There seemed
nothing of the Royal Feast, Mollison or
Parkwood type among them. Gengoult
Smith, the Lord Mayor, started Princess
Cynthia, a small sister to Hall Mark,
whom he has leased for centenary spring
racing; she showed pace.
How Hall Mark came to go out at
evens for the October Stakes is a mys-
tery. The big punters blundered badly
this time. At the beginning it was 2 to 1
on the son of Heroic and 5 to 1 Waltz-
ing Lily. Waltzing Lily had been re-
ported slightly amiss, but Leek consid-
ered her to be equal to a run in public.
Spearflash, a stable-mate of Gothic Gem,
also met with support. Dempsey noti-
fied Holt that he intended to adopt wait-
ing tactics with Hall Mark, believing that
the horse had failed at Caulfield through
being too far forward about half-way.
Holt approved of the policy, but urged
the jockey not to overdo things.
While Yultewirra was tearing away at
the head of affairs five furlongs from
home, Hall Mark was second-last. But
he was getting galloping room ; and as
soon as the straight was entered he
rushed through the field to register a
magnificent victory by 2\ lengths from
Yultewirra, with L’Elite third. Waltzing
Lily was never dangerous. On a satu-
rated track, Hall Mark covered the mile
in lmin. 38|-sec.
C. B. Kellow will not be able to see
Hall Mark in action this spring. Kellow
was in poor health when he left for Eng-
land, and on the return trip he had
a bad turn before the steamer reached
Fremantle. The voyage to Melbourne
was continued, but C.B.'s friends are
much concerned regarding his condition.
The luck of Lou Robertson as a
trainer is beginning to change for the
better. He landed a division of the Stand
Handicap with Farndale, the Curialis
colt belonging to Fell and Hunter. The
stable has supported Farndale and Mara-
bou for £25,000 in the two-Cups double.
Judging by the manner in which Farn-
dale disposed of his opponents on Satur-
day he will be hard to beat at Caulfield.
Farndale scored, running away, by three
lengths from the Sydney Cup winner
Broad Arrow, who finished impressively
to beat Folk Lore by a head for second.
This was the best form shown by Broad
Arrow in Melbourne, and evidently he is
nicely on the way to being wound up
for the Cups. Marabou, whom Lou
Robertson has set for the Melbourne
Cup, competed in the October Stakes.
Last at the half-mile, he was still near
the rear at the straight entrance; yet,
if Angelo had not cut under his neck at
the two-furlong post, Marabou might
have got a place.
Arachne won the Edward Manifold
Stakes from end to end, and she must
have a great chance in the Caulfield
Guineas.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Though only a day off the boat, Fred
Myers,' described as an American doctor,
beat Jack Clarke in four rounds at Syd-
ney Stadium on Saturday night, scoring
two falls to none. Clarke has whipped
Lurich, who at Leichhardt added to his
numerous victories over King Elliott.
Tony Felice had been billed as Lurich’s
opponent. There were a few hoots when
Elliott’s substitution was announced, but
nobody left the building, and they will
all go again. They are born at the rate
of two a minute in Sydney.
Ins and Outs
Bowlers once more had the better of
it in the Sydney grade cricket matches.
Chilvers again routed St. George, the
Northern District man taking 15 for 84
in the match. His marble already looks
pretty good for South Africa. Veteran
Mair helped Balmain to out Waver-
ley by taking 8 for 64 in the Eastern
Suburbs club’s second innings. Govan,
the slow bowler who was tried for
Queensland while still at Brisbane Gram-
mar, made a good start for Cumberland
with 3 for 21, made Yeates 115 n.o.
against Glebe for Petersham, and Falk
102 n.o. for Uni. v. Paddington.
* * * *
“Five Ways”: South African J. A.
Christy has clicked with Queensland’s
offer of a three years’ engagement as
playing coach at a salary of £4OO a year.
The Afrikander will also have a job in
the sports department of a big Brisbane
shop, but whether this carries additional
brass or not isn’t stated. Christy has been
asked to get here in time for the first
match against South Australia, starting at
Brisbane on November 30. It is under-
stood there will be no official objection
to his playing at once. Christy is 30, a
fine, hard-driving batsman and a first-
class fieldsman, while he is a useful right-
hand change bowler. It is to be hoped
he will make better weather of it with
the Queensland executive than English-
man Andy Ducat did.
* * $ *
“Springhaans”: What with politicians
and grasshoppers, N.S.W. outback has
been having a bad time. Now an inva-
sion of some of the districts by the Eng-
lish women cricketers is announced, their
itinerary including Deniliquin, Canberra,
Goulburn, Junee and other oases in the
great open spaces. This tour will be
made when the visitors return from
Queensland.

Footbrawl
Wet weather and Geelong’s poor show-
ing against Richmond the previous
Saturday kept the attendance at the Vic.
League “preliminary” final between Gee-
long and South Melbourne down to
30,400. The gate was but £1413 15s. 4d.,
but the League should lose no sleep over
that, having collected £lOOO rain insur-
ance for the second game running. As
a spectacle the match wasn’t worth the
gate, the men from the Pivot lacking
stamina and fading out of the picture
after half-time. Up to then play was
interesting, with the possibility that Gee-
long would develop more speed and some
ginger. Unfortunately it was South that
put on the pace, while Geelong got
slower as the game went on. Todd,
Geelong’s full-back, was splendid, and
repeatedly baulked both Pratt and Nash
together; Quinn, roving, worked hard and
effectively ; Hickey, Carney, and Collins
were the best of the others. For South,
Pratt, when he kept away from Todd,
marked cleverly, and scored 6 goals;
McKay, Richards and Thomas shone.
South won by 15 goals i 8 behinds (108
points) to Geelong’s 7-6 (48 points).

The Victorian R.U. premiership went
this year to University, which defeated
the minor premiers, Melbourne, in the
grand final by 5-0. Though the first
club founded when the Union code was
revived some years ago, this is Uni.’s
first premiership.
“Stretcher”: Though Sydney R.C.
won the senior eights at Mosman re-
gatta on Saturday and the right to repre-
sent N.S.W. in the challenge eights at
Henley-on-Yarra regatta on November
3, the club has decided to give the Mel-
bourne show a miss. Sydney Unj., how-
ever, is sending down an eight. Uni.
was a good second to Sydney on Satur-
day.

Evens Peter Pan, 6 to 4 Rogilla, 10
to 1 Chatham, 20 to 1 Nightly, 33 to 1
Lough Neagh. Such was the betting on
the A.J.C. Craven Plate, though Chat-
ham had won the race twice and had run
splendidly in his third Epsom with lOst.
91b. True, Davidson had the mount
instead of Pike (on the ice), but the
Newcastle young man is a capable
jockey and he and Chatham are old ac-
quaintances. Admittedly Peter Pan had
beaten Chatham in that w.f.a. race at
Victoria Park; but on this occasion
there was no Silver Ring to be shaken
off, as happened then.
Ten to one Chatham! After his first
race at Randwick nearly four years ago,
this Page vowed it would back Chatham
every time he started —and broke its vow
when Windbag’s son went off in the
ensuing spring: he got influenza or
something and was a sick horse for
months. It cannot remember his going
out at a longer price in a w.f.a. or big
handicap race.
Davidson let the beautiful bay go to the
front; then he took a pull. After slow-
ing the field down cleverly he gave Chat-
ham his head ; and it was all over. Peter
Pan settled Rogilla, but never looked
like catching Chatham: three-quarters of
a length ; a length and a half; 2min.
34sec. It’s a pity Phar Lap never met
Chatham, both fit and well, at a mile.
Another surprise was the backing of
Gladswood for the Members’ Handicap
too. This Page’s fancy
for the Derby, Glads-
wood, sweated freely
before that race, drifted
to tens, and refused to
do his best till the issue
had been decided;
then he came home
fairly well in fifth
place. He looked an
improved colt on Wed-
nesday and galloped'
more kindly; at his
best he seems a plod-
ding stayer, with an
outside chance in the
Melbourne Cup. In
the Members’ Handi-
cap he was third to
Limyris (10 to 1) and
Verbery (33 to 1), three
parts of a length be-
hind the winner. Ver-
bery backers received
£l5 15s. for 10s. on the
grandstand place tote;
his s.o. div. would have been nearly
£7O.
« • • • •
Limyris is trained by Jack King, who
gives his Randwick string open-air treat-
ment on a farm he has bought at Rooty
Hill; and so is Miss Nottava (10 to 1),
who overcame one of the favorites,
Mainlaw, in the Sydney Handicap.
Limyris, Miss Nottava, Lady Primrose,
winner of the Gimcrack Stakes (at sixes)
and Senior, who added a success in the
Suburban Handicap to his Trial Stakes
victory on the first day, are Maoriland-
bred. It was a great meeting for Maori-
land-bred horses, and also for the book-
makers, though they still complain there
is little money about.

“Punter”: America is used to freak
bets, especially at Presidential elec-
tions, when backers will undertake to roll
a peanut up a mountain with a tooth-
pick and so on if their man loses. Sydney
saw a rare instance the other day when
one well-known Market-street “sport”
bet another that if Chatham won the
Craven he would carry the other on his
back from Elizabeth-street, down Park-
street, to William-street. The winner
was a heavyweight, and by the time the
loser had finished his job he was all in.
A large crowd, including several thou-
sand small boys, accompanied the pun-
ters, and a good time was had by all
except the exhausted loser.
* * * *
“Old Gun”: The Q.T.C. stipes have
outed one Cunningham, of Sydney, for
having sent a circular through the mails
urging the addressees —as if each indi-
vidual was the only recipient— to pay
particular attention to one of his horses
which he had “set” to win a race at
Albion Park. Very generously, he offered,
if his client had any trouble in placing
the money, to get it on for him. Under
one of the new rules adopted by all the
leading Australian clubs as from August
1, Cunningham went on the peg for 12
months. The horse was scratched for the
race, for which he was equal favorite
with a local prad.
Ins andf Outs
“Home Fires”: It makes a fellow
water at the mouth to read the list of
presents Woodfull’s men have received.
They include Worcester porcelain, North-
ampton boots, Manchester suit lengths,
Taunton gloves, Sheffield cutlery and
countless other baksheesh in kind in the
way of fountain-pens and pencils, suitably
mounted. There is one omission, how-
ever. No mention is made of anyone
being presented with a set of Notting-
ham lace curtains.
“That’ll he a cauliflower, I suppose?”
“Yairs —an it looks like there’s some beans
coinin’ later.”
“Aigburth”: If we can believe London
“Daily Telegraph,” England is not likely
to see O’Reilly with an Australian Eleven
again. Bill is reported to have told an
interviewer that he is not going to sacri-
fice his professional prospects to gladia-
torial cricket. He is a State school-
teacher already well up the ladder, and
he means to go higher. He will play
in Australia, of course. It is a pity
there are not more like him.
* * * *
“Mardy”: The departure of the Aus-
tralian Eleven from England has led a
Manchester newspaper of some import-
ance in the dog-racing and profes-
sional football world to announce that
the team was leaving Bradman to
shift for himself in hospital, the contract
with the Board of Control having ex-
pired. The tin-hare journal added that
Don will have to pay his own hospital and
surgical fees. Facts are that the con-
tract doesn’t end until the last member of
the team is back in Australia. The
board will pay every bean in connection
with Don’s illness, and. in any case, all
players are insured by the board against
accident or illness. Travelling on the
Continent or elsewhere, they draw their
full allowance until their return to this
country.
* * * *
“St. John's”: Marylebone C.C. and
others had a perfunctory pow-wow about
the bodyline racket in London, Austra-
lian reps, attending. Of all the fatuous
suggestions put in, the one from Arthur
Mailey was awarded the grindstone by
unanimous consent. This was to draw
a St. Andrew’s Cross on the pitch from
crease to crease, the lines bisecting in
the middle; the bowler was to pitch
the ball in specified positions. The re-
mark of one delegate that the scheme
would convert cricket to a game of ludo
was its requiem. There is only one way
to wipe out bodyline bowling, and the
M.C.C., having had its lesson, knows it.
It is to appoint captains who will play
the game.
* * # *
“The Hove”: That a man may be
a professional cricketer and in all essen-
tials a gentleman has been notably proved
in the case of Maurice Tate, of Sussex,
who has been handed a handsome douceur
and elected an honorary member of
Sussex C.C., this last an unprecedented
honor for any paid player. Maurice
has been captaining Sussex with great
success, another unusual office for a pro.
to fill, though not so rare in the past
as it is to-day, when England is full of
“amateurs’* struggling for the joint jobs
of secretary (paid) and captain (hon.).
Yorkshire, Notts and Lancashire have
had professional skippers within the
writer’s memory. Tate is the first to lead
Sussex.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Spoon”: By the time this is in print,
Sarazen and Kirkwood will have played
their first match in Sydney at the Aus-
tralian club’s course. To-morrow they
meet Ferrier and Hattersley at Manly ;
admission, ss. That over, the pair
plunge into the Australian open and
professional championships, beginning
at Rose Bay (N.S.W.) oil October
11. They will have little time to
shake down, but those who recall how
quickly Walter Hagen found touch on
his visit here with Kirkwood don’t ex-
pect the nerveless Sarazen or his mate
to have any trouble.
* * * *
“Yerong.”: Brisbane golfers are still
hammering away at the old grievance.
The oligarchs in the south continue to
refuse them an Australian championship,
though a mere dorp like Adelaide, as
Brisbane considers the Holy City, takes
its regular turn. An ultimatum is to be
presented to the A.G.U. requesting, de-
manding, insisting that Brisbane be given
the show in 1938.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: The Englishwomen's golf
championship once more provided a
color interlude in what is becoming
rather a dreary business. Last year i
chronicled the feat of one Gloria Mino-
prio, who turned up for the event armed
with one cleek and clad in red trousers,
a green pullover and a yellow beret
Very naturally, the first couple of oppo-
nents were stupefied, especially as Gloria
played uncommonly good golf with her
one club. This year the lady wore
bright-blue breeks strapped beneath
blue suede shoes, a white blouse and a
blue beret. Her first opponent, Betty
Somerville, was badly beaten, complain-
ing bitterly of the raree-show. However,
next day Gloria was eliminated, pro-
bably by a color-blind playerette.
* * *
“Divot Digger”: Manly Golf Club has
set a handsome example to some of its
ultra-snobbish contemporaries which
delight in imagining themselves quaite in
the English mode. The Villagers are
making all golfers from abroad hon.
members during their stay in Sydney,
amateurs and professionals alike. This
is the general rule in Yankeedom ; pro-
fessionals have the run of the clubhouses
on the same terms as members. In most
of the British clubs the paid men are not
allowed into the clubhouse. Australian
clubs compromise by giving the pros
quarters of their own. This is on a par
with the separate dressing-rooms, with
their own entrance and exit gate, to
which English professional cricketers are
relegated.
* * ••!: :!:
“Hamilton”: Brisbane golfing heads
are hopping about like a lot of decapi-
tated hens. The trouble is the imminent
invasion of hordes of golfers of a type
and class which the State has never
beheld before. The British amateurs
arrive on November 1, and will play
a match over 18 holes, singles and four-
somes, against the local talent. Some of
this talent is being lassoed with difficulty.
One or two invitees have urgent engage-
ments elsewhere, so emergencies are be-
ing sought. On November 7 the Ameri-
can professionals heave in sight. They
will be only one day in Brisbane, when
they will engage a team of local pro-
fessionals before scooting south again.
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham”: One of the last strong-
posts of wowserdom in Australian sport
has fallen. After years of threats and
fulminations, the Australian tennis heads
have decided to permit women and men
players to wear shorts. N.S.W., which
last year had an inspector to make sure
the girls wore skirts and not shorts faked
to imitate them, has had to follow suit.
The reason for the change of spirit is
simple. The overseas players, men and
women, have passed a quiet tip that
they will only play in shorts. To insist
on skirts would mean no star turns and
a poor gate. There was nothing else for
it. The jingle of the guinea has obliterated
the still, small voice of moral rectitude.
In fact, in writer’s opinion, if the visiting
ladies and gentlemen insisted on appear-
ing in the uniform of Adam and Eve
before the Fall the tennis heads would
meekly acquiesce.

tte Intestinal
Tract *
is the most prolific
source of disease"
states famous oerman doctor, Professor L. Schmiedier
SELF-POISONING-the basic cause of
most ill-health
Many specialists unite in blaming
Self-poisoning, or Autoxima, for
much of present-day ill-health.
Modern foods and the stress of
modem life combine to produce a
sluggish condition of the intes-
tines. Particles of food-waste, not
properly evacuated, become en-
crusted on the intestinal walls,
much as a water-pipe becomes
coated with rust. This waste de-
cays, harbouring disease-breeding
germs and poisons which are ab-
sorbed into the system. Thus your
blood-stream is polluted, your
health undermined. Self-poisoning,
from which nine out of ten suffer,
is responsible for all manner of
aches, pains and sicknesses.
TRY THIS SIMPLE WAY TO
HEALTH
Fortunately, modem medicine has
at its disposal a preparation with
extraordinary health-bringing pro-
perties COLOSEPTIC. It is a
natural, simple way to flush the
poisons of autoxima right out of
the system. COLOSEPTIC
promptly combats chronic consti-
pation. It invigorates the intestinal
muscles —it stimulates the flow of
gastric juices and improves the ap-
petite COLOSEPTIC completely
loosens off the waste matter and
passes it smoothly out of the body—
thus removing the basic cause of Self-
poisoning. It rids the blood of all
impurities through Nature’s other
outlets —the kidneys, the pores of
the skin and the respiratory organs.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
Are you suffering from constipa-
tion, weakness, indigestion, gas in
the stomach and bowels, catarrh,
backache, rheumatism, neuritis, ec-
zema, bladder complaint, pimples?
Drink COLOSEPTIC in hot water
every morning. Try it for at least
seven days. COLOSEPTIC will
COLOSEPTIC LIKE MAGIC.—I bought a packet of COLO SEPTIC and have
been taking it faithfully. I would like to say that its effects on the bowels are
like magic. I have been suffering now with bowel trouble for 5 years and
my age is 32. Doctors wanted to operate 4 years ago, but I refused.
— Mrs. G. C., Island Bay, Wellington.

The intes-
tinal tract com-

small and large

organs through
which waste
matter is passed
out of the body.
VO
“tone” up your sluggish intestines—
soften accumulated wastes keep
your body internally active and
clean.
With the poisons no longer circulat-

better you feel. Gone are the head-

C. MASON,

Friends of the respondent are particularly
requested to forward to him the foregoing
advertisement.
JOHN HAMILTON MILES is the Solicitoi
for the Petitioner, whose address for service is
at the offices of MESSIEURS O, and R
BEERE & CO., Solicitors, Dominion Farmers’

ton, New Zealand.

“Roland Garros”: After hanging in
the wind for some time France has sud-
denly decided to send two players to
Melbourne. The chosen are Brugnon
and Boussus, and they leave Toulon on
November 19. The pair should make a
formidable combination in doubles, while
Boussus, a very much better player than
when we saw him here with Borotra and
co. some years ago, should make the best
of the opposition sit up in the singles.
Brugnon seems to be still the Verdun of
French tennis.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Three N.S.W.
tennis-players are showing remarkable
promise, and the younger they are the
better they shape. Bromwich, the eldest of
the three, has unfortunately adopted a
freak style resembling that which promises
to pull McGrath up at a dead-end. He is
young enough to be coached out of this
error, and should be taken in hand at
once. Lindo, better known as “Mickey
the Mouse,” is not only a fine singles
player, but in combination with Huxley
is a superlative doubles player. Huxley is
more than Lindo’s equal in the doubles
perhaps, and, like his mate, tries no
fancy tricks.
Miscellaneous
“Spike”: Athlete Jack Metcalfe, just
returned from the Empire Games in Eng-
land, has confessed that it is a mistake
to try too many stunts —a fact the writer
pointed out to the young gentleman a
year ago, when he took part in pretty
well every event, from high-jumping to
putting the shot, in one afternoon. He
is going to adopt the overseas method of
specialisation in one or at most two sub-
jects —what they were he did not say.
Incidentally, the returned traveller de-
scribed the food in England as foul. The
hotel people were quite unable to under-
stand the Australian passion for meat,
and the team was snowed under with
greasy eggs and bacon at breakfast until
life was a burden. Lunch and dinner
were a bit better, but no amount of curs-
ing and protest could banish the loathed
eggs a-cook in the morning.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Victoria is adding a
team of four English amateur track
athletes to the centenary congestion.
The team is to arrive on December 8,
and will show in the centenary events on
January 26 and February 8, which should
give the members lots of time to pick
up condition and form. A. W. Sweeny
is the sprinter, and one who greatly im-
pressed our people at the Empiad. G.
Rampling, one of the finest English
quarter-milers seen for years, won the
Empiad event in 48sec. D. Finlay is a
high-hurdler, and a hot one. He took the
big event at the English meeting in
15 l-ssec. for the 120 yards. The other
member, not yet named, will almost
certainly be the mile champion, Jerry
Comes.
* * * *
“Welt”: The Henley-on-Yarra people
are thinking of adding yet another crew
to the dozens that already threaten to
fill the tiny canalised stream from bank
to bank. The latest is a Dutch crew
from Batavia, and if the business end
can be fixed up it will be here. The
Dutchmen must be a pretty fair lot, for
they generally show up well at Singapore
and other big annual regattas thereaway
where the rowing is of high standard.
“Long Rest”: Walter Lindrum put up
a new speed record for baulk-line bil-
liards in his match for the world’s cham-
pionship against McConachy in Mel-
bourne by stringing together 1065 points
in 40min. 59sec. This is not the record
score under the b.-l. rules. McConachy
holds that with 1927 made at Brisbane.
Walter’s highest is 1909.

Interest Rates
Looking down the share-lists in the
daily papers these days the man —or
woman—with a few hard-earned hun-
dreds to invest can’t see much of a
return in sight. Commonwealth stocks
show under £3 10s. per cent., sound in-
surance cos. return less in some cases, and
the banks nearly all yield below 4 p.c. on
current divs. and market prices.
Broken Hill Prop, returns 3| p.c., Aus-
tralian Glass 3-J-, Colonial Sugar 3j- and
British Tobacco 3 p.c. Anything which
shows a safe p.c. or 5 p.c. is worthy
of close scrutiny. But there aren’t many
sound 5 p.c.’s going begging. Berlei ords.
and prefs., J. C. Ludowici and Arthur
Cocks are among the tew 5 p.c. yielders
whose past experience gives reasonable
assurance of continuity of div. rates.
Interest paid on fixed deposits in Aus-
tralian banks is down to \ \ p.c. for three
months, 2f for six, 2| for 12 and 2f p.c.
for 24 months. In Maoriland the rates
are practically the same. Hence the
popularity of gold scrip; so far the
speculators are mostly living on each
other. The number of div.-paying gold
shows in Australia is a couple of score ;
those not yet earn-
ing, and in which
most of the specula-
tors’ profits are
being made, total
nearer a thousand.
A lot of them
should eventually be
genuine earners, but
at present they are
not.
The rise in wool
prices last season
suggested a greater
demand for finance
and a firming of in-
terest rates; that
probability has since
faded with the re-
turn of low prices.
Cheap money seems
assured for a good
while yet. It is en-
couraging to indus-
try, but it means
increasing care for
the elderly with only
a thousand or so to
invest. These people
with small resources
are the ones usually
tempted by the go-getter. They are
advised to protect their capital and
accept the present low returns rather
than dabble with glamorous but un-
proved schemes. If they are in soundly-
established concerns better divs. will
show up later on.
Machines and the Workman
The August “Monthly Review” of
Barclay’s Bank quotes figures showing
the economisation in human labor, owing
to mechanical improvements, which were
given at the League of Nations Union’s
recent conference. The number of em-
ployees per week per car in one British
factory fell from 55 in 1922 to 24 in
1923, to 12 in 1926 and 10 in 1927.
Later information gives the figure for
1934 as eight. An engine bearing-bolt
which took 115 minutes to make with
the machinery of 1880 took only 12
minutes in 1920, and 7.7 minutes in 1930.
In a tool-making plant with 16 drop-
hammers in 1918, 480 men were em-
ployed ; in 1927, with an extra six
hammers working, this factory employed
no more than 280.
Taking these figures only, re-employ-
ment of a great number of at present
unemployed artisans and machinists
would look hopeless. Labor-saving in-
ventions grow more perfect every day.
But, fortunately, it is only one side of
the picture.
Where this labor-saving machinery is
worth while — i.e., where it reduces the
cost of the product—it should also reduce
the price to the consumer, and extend the
demand. Particularly in America, a car
that was an expensive luxury in 1910
became a commonplace utility in 1930.
Slump has inevitably disorganised things
in the States, but luxurious cars can be
bought in U.S.A. even to-day for less
than a thousand dollars.
In Britain, despite the figures quoted
and the depression, the number of em-
ployees in that particular motor-car fac-
tory has risen from 3197 in 1922 to
16,000 in 1934. The estimated total
number of insured workers aged 16-64
rose from 9,526,000 in 1924 to 10,163,000
at June 25 last.
Though the International Labor Office
at Geneva points out that the reabsorp-
tion of unemployed is not taking place
as rapidly as the restoration of output,
Barclay’s “Review” records the opinion
that the reduction of selling costs eventu-
ally creates new purchasing power, new
“Can’t stop t’ give y’ a match, cobber. Gotter get on with me relief work.”
wants and new avenues of employment.
A better standard of living and shorter
working hours should follow if the bene-
fits of inventions are harmoniously dis-
tributed between employer and em-
ployee. One point not mentioned, though
it is probably more to blame for
whatever unemployment does occur than
the actual labor-saving machinery itself,
is the overhead costs and idle capital
represented by the obsolete plant dis-
placed.
Glass
The new glass co. now on the stocks
in Sydney is the first large industrial float
since slump hit us. It is an encouraging
sign, though for a long time there has
been room for two glass cos. Unless a
trade-war with the big A.G.M. eventuates
the ruling charges for bottles should be
profitable.
The A.G.M. was formed in Vic. in
1915 to amalgamate the Melbourne Glass
Bottle Works, the Waterloo Bottle Works
and another co. In 1919 W. J. Smith
resigned and established the Zetland
works at Sydney. In 1921 A.G.M. and
the Zetland cos. amalgamated on a share-
for-share basis; since then A.G.M. has
had things pretty much its own way.
If the Atlas Co. is able to help in
cheapening the cost of distributing pre-
serves and aiding the fruit- and beef-
grower, which should in turn assist our
exports to Asia, it will deserve well of
Australia.
Unemployment in Australia reached
its worst stage around May, 1932, when
30 p.c. of the reporting trade-unionists
were out of jobs. For August last the
percentage was 20.4—the lowest since
May, 1930, when the figure was 18.5
p.c. Since the darkest period the im-
provement to August last has been as
follows: Westralia, 13.1 p.c.; Vic., 10.2
p.c. ; South Aus., 9.8 p.c.; N. S. Wales,
8.7 p.c.; Tas. and Queensland, 8.5 p.c.
Distributed amongst trades, the re-
employment has been- Miscellaneous
manufacturing, 18.9 p.c.; building 16.1
p.c.; engineering, 11.3 p.c.; furniture,
10.3 p.c. ; and clothing, etc., 8.8 p.c.
Figures of 42 N.S.W. factories, repre-
senting 11 p.c. of all factory employment
in the State, show that of every 100
people employed in Jan., 1930, only 75
were employed a year later, but 99 were
back on the payroll at June 30 last.

Westralian Mines Dept.’s revenue for
1933-34 was £27,768, the highest since
1914-15. It would be interesting to know
what company promoters’ profits on the
resale of leases, abandoned for many
years, amounted to. The department’s
whack, which doubtless includes profits
from the State batteries, hardly measures
up to the average promoters’ rake-off on
one decent float.

Germany’s policy of economic national-
ism weighs heavily on the Deutschlanders.
Pork is reported to cost 2s. 3d. a pound,
tea is 7s. and coffee ss. Clothes are 30
p.c. higher. Woollen goods are obtain-
able only at prohibitive prices; vege-
table-textile substitutes are the fashion.

After a slight relapse gold touched a
record price of £7 2s. 2+d. an ounce in
London last week. The Australian figure
is around £8 15s. 6d.
* * * *
The price of wheat is down further in
Winnipeg and Liverpool, and Australian
markets have been in sympathy. The
Melbourne price is about 3s. a bushel,
with stored wheat 2s. 9d. on trucks Wil-
liamstown.

Swifts (Aust.) have bought the Glad-
stone meatworks (N.Q.) at a price in the
vicinity of £190,000. Killing for the
chilled beef trade is expected to start in
February next, when about 300 head a
day will be handled.
* * * *
“Tuart”: “Eighth Wonder” has only
registered an outer (B. J2/9/’34). The
Forests Department—and we have a real
one in the West —prevented the export of
our strongest commercial hardwood
(tuart) long ago in order to keep supplies
for the railway people. Tuart is used for
the heavy frameworks and top rails,
jarrah for the floor. The remaining side
rails were Oregon because it is lighter.
The question of weight is very import-
ant in a country where grade has to be
sacrificed on the altar of cheap railroad
construction. Karri is now used to im-
prove our trade balance —another effort
by departmental livewires.
* * t- *
“Akrab”: The tests of spotted-gum
axe-handles quoted by “Barka” (B.
12/9/’34) seem to stretch the point a bit
further than an axeman can afford to
bend the handles in question. Spotted-
gum is a grand timber, stronger than
hickory of equal grade in many ways.
But better as an axe-handle? No. It
won’t resist the same shock, and you
can’t force the chip out by twisting the
handle. No timber stands torsion like
hickory.

Export of oranges from Australia to
Glasgow Jan.-Sept., 1933, totalled 10,415
cases; during the same period 1934,
2,928 cases. The fall may be accounted
for by some facts received in a letter
from Glasgow:
This year we started well with your
oranges, but, unfortunately, two shipments
have arrived in an appalling condition,
making them practically unsaleable, and
this has been most disappointing, particu-
larly as they would have realised good
prices had they only been in decent con-
dition.
S.A. Premier Butler protests that inferior
stuff is still being shipped.
* -e *
Shipments of wheat by exporting coun-
tries for the week to Sept. 20 totalled
8,640,000 bushels North America
3,576,000, Argentina 3,160,000, Australia
1,448,000 and Russia 168,000 bushels.
The Soviet’s shipments have fallen off
greatly this season.
H* v
“Abinger”: Sussex and Surrey and
Essex will have a quiet laugh at “Bill
Ding,” who thinks that Australian tim-
bers have “proved to be the finest house-
building woods in the world” because
there are “cottages still extant which were
built 100 years ago” (B. 4/10/’34).
Most southern English counties can show
dozens of weatherboard houses which
were built 200 to 300 years ago, and not
always of hardwoods. There is English
timberwork 700 years and more old still
extant, and even ships approaching a
couple of centuries —the Victory was
built in 1765, and she still has a long way
to go. We should stop importing Oregon
and Baltic pine before we begin to per-
suade other countries that our timbers
are the finest in the world.

“Mundic”: The new Mt. Morgan Co.
is taking a careful interest in the welfare
of its employees, but I wonder what the
Geordies, Cousin Jacks and the Tip-
perary Pointers of a generation ago
would think of a workers’ clubhouse
with swimming pool, tennis courts,
bowling green, recreation park and
cricket pitch—and cash bonuses on wages
at the end of the year so that everybody
may go to Emu Park for a holiday.
Thirty years ago most of the welfare
work used to be done between the Sham-
rock and the sportsground fence, where
long lines of hardy and bewhiskcred in-
habitants passed the cutter before going
home to play the cornet —there were four
comets and 16 trombones per head of
population, and enough bands to reach
irom Cemetery-road to Hades. Anybody
who felt athletically inclined played
Rugby (on somebody else’s face for pre-
ference), or chased goats from under the
galvanised-iron huts which we used to
call houses, or walloped the son and heir
for being walloped at school. But bowls!
Tennis! Those recreations were for a
race apart (“them silvertails”), who had
tea at Carlton House or on the Range,
and occupied the front form in the
School of Arts when “The Lights o’
London” was played or when the bio-
graph opened for a season.

“Questo”: Cooktown is a town of
ancients (B. 26/9/’34). A mild and
equable climate enables them to live
long. Ten consecutive deaths there aver-
aged 96 years, the oldest being 102, the
most youthful 88. A gay old spark of
94 once proposed to a mere flapper of
86 years. The lady’s refusal drove him
to a too-frequent indulgence in the cup
that cheers, and to this can probably be
attributed his death four or five years
afterwards.

“Kaloa”: When Jimmy Bracewell,
at the age limit, leaves the Queensland
Bench, on which he has sat for over 30
years, about the last of the wardens who
saw gold in large lumps will have gone.
What a race of men they were who
ruled' the destinies of the fields and
meted out justice a generation ago!
W. R. O. Hill was the doyen. He had
seen the beginnings of the Palmer and
the Towers and Ravenswood. It was
his pride that he had once watched Tom
Sayers fight. He was small and thick-
set, with a goatee beard and a stutter,
but when a large applicant asked him:
“Phwy don’t ye sing the flaming thing
so that we can onderstand ye?” he
jumped over the table and, after
proper preliminaries, remarked: “My
man, you won’t be able to even whistle
to-morrow after what I’ve done to you! ”
Then there were J. C. Linedale., little,
spectacled, who was once challenged to
a duel with axes by an irate Forty-niner
on the Dee Rush ; Millican, who knew
every field in Queensland like his hand ;
Cherry, Parkinson, Boddington, Hal-
dane and Lee Bryce. With limited tele-
graph facilities and slow mails they
were almost kings in their own domains
before the dawn of Federation, but there
is no scope for local kings any more.

“XXX”: The Queensland hotel raid
on Sept. 23 must have been a record. All
hotels in Brisbane and south on the road
to N.S.W. were searched for Sabbath-
breakers. The efficiency with which the
job was done, we are told, “speaks
volumes for the force” and for the “wis-
dom of the Commissioner in providing
the police with a fleet of fast cars” ; as
“many prosecutions may follow,” many
Queenslanders will not agree. What the
constabulary should have done was to
round the catch up in a theatre and
charge admission, because, if the North
was at its best, it must have been an in-
teresting one. The last Sunday raid I
was in (it was in a freer and easier day)
the haul consisted of one P.M. drinking
with a bookmaker, one reporter, a ser-
geant on holiday, a visiting nobleman and
a hysterical barmaid. We were glad the
P.M. was there. He fined the pub and
the raiding constables drinks all round.
* * * *
“Meerah”: “Kaloa” (B 19/9/’34) is
right when he states that the graves of
Australians killed at Kabakaul in the
first fight of the war were “mossgrown
and neglected-looking.” I was in
Rabaul in 1928, and was shocked at
the condition into which they had been
allowed to crumble. Most of the graves
' were overgrown with rank vegetation,
and in some instances the earth cover-
ing had collapsed, almost exposing the
coffins. Fortunately about this time a
new returned-soldier Superintendent of
Botanic Gardens was appointed, and his
first act was to restore all the soldiers’
graves. When I saw them two years
later they were in a most excellent con-
dition and an attendant was devoting his
whole time to the care of the cemetery
in general.
* * * *
“Toowong”: The modern overlander?
I recently gave roadway to four lady
drovers, 4000 wethers and a kelpie bitch.
The kelpie carried her sheepskin booties
round her neck (no bindi-i where we
met), and took advantage of the halt to
attend to her maternal duties in the
waggon. We spent an enjoyable hour
talking to the boss, who shared the “mak-
ings” with me, exposing a set of nature’s
pearls as she licked the Zig-Zag. i fear
for the boys on the Warrego when, with
her jargon of spark-plugs and wethers,
she crosses the border. My mate and 1
were so crestfallen after an hour in her
“Could you reahlly kill me with this?”
“Too right, boss —if I could stop larfin’."
spick-and-span company that we washed
the old ’bus at the first tank.

“Albion Pass”: The group-captain com-
manding the R.A.F. flying-boat squad-
ron which has come from England via
Torres awards a championship to North
Australia. He says it has “the loneliest
coastline we have ever visited.” How can
it be otherwise when Sydney and Bris-
bane have needed £14,000,000, which
would settle the best of it with southern
immigrants, merely to build bridges so
that their inhabitants won’t have to
suffer the hardship of riding a mile or
so every day on ferry-boats?
“Vic”: Brisbane found its strangest
prodigal on the doorstep a few days ago.
Answering a summons to the gate of his
quarters, the superintendent of Boggo-
road Gaol welcomed a man named
Stelling who had escaped from St. Helena
in 1930. Stelling had been sentenced to
10 months for stealing a yacht valued
at £2OOO in the Brisbane River. Trying
to sail the vessel down the bay he and
a companion were stranded on a sand-
bank and captured. Incarcerated in St.
Helena, they stole a dinghy and oars, and
got away at night in a rough sea. Next
day the dinghy was found, but not the
errant captives. Stelling says that he
escaped to Sydney, got a job as an engin-
eer in a cargo vessel, went round the
world and, his conscience troubling him,
decided to come home to Brisbane and
“get this wretched business over.” Need-
less to say, the authorities accommodated
him, adding a month to the unexpired
four months of his sentence.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
When our Sir Leslie opened the Bushmen’s
Carnival at Warwick, he congratulated the
committee on having stuck to the good old
Australian term. “Rodeo” is a word to which
he takes strong objection. The thing was
a huge success, and the Campfire Ball pro-
vided three pretty debs., Clarice Munsie, Lilian
Kcates and Olive White.
Over four years ago John Darnell be-
queathed £lO,OOO to establish and maintain
a Queensland National Gallery on condition
that within five years another £lO,OOO was
raised. The legacy will lapse in nine months.
A campaign to secure the money will open
with a garden party at Wynberg, the residence
of Archbishop Duhig.
Silver entree-dish and coffee-spoon sets and a
host of smaller gifts were showered on Val
Br&dy when she said good-bye to her con-
freres at the bank and settled down to trou-
seau gathering. Her altar date with lan Grant
is for October 29.
The Lady Mayoress’s Ball, in aid of the funds
of the women’s section of the Social Service
League, was a great success. On the walls of
the supper-rooms (decked with pink spring
flowers) were two large early-Victorian ladies
in pink frilled skirts who bore between them
the badge of the league. Dorothy and Ina
Jones looked after the guests. Bouquets were
passed to Mrs. Forgan Smith and to Mrs.
Percy Pease, president of the women’s section.
ml a | Ue^ s werc the Premier, Percy Pease,
re P air ’ J - w - Davidson and his
N/i C ’r> E Kemps, the H. Magees and
• j Dynes and his daughter. There was
one debutante, the chick of Senator and Mrs.
Gordon Brown.
The new building for the Dept, of Agricul-
ture and Stock which is in William-street is
to have a cafeteria on the top floor. This
awakened the Government employees in the
treasury building to the possibilities of their
1001. they have held a meeting to form a
recreation club, and will approach the Premier
to ask lor the same facilities as their bucolic
comiades across the way. They also are
talking about a library and a billiard-room.
Eddie Cahill, who sailed for England by the
Stuart Star on October 6, is the first passen-
ger to be carried from Australia by the Blue
Star line since it commenced operations last
July. Quite an army of Eddie’s friends waved
farewell. He expects to be away for at least
a year.
The Royal Queensland Yacht Club’s Jubilee
Ball at the Irocadero attracted 500 dancers.
Ihe decorations were nautical, and so was the
convei sation. Proceeds will send Queensland
boats down to contest the Forster Cup at the
Victorian centenary regatta. The opening
ol the sailing season happened next day,
and the white wings werc drenched before
the home moorings were reached. Everyone
with any kind ol craft had issued invitations,
and 1 rayed tempers and ruined hats were very
noticeable at the end of the day.
A map of India done in pink and blue
flowers decked the table when Kath Mac-
Donnell and Nell Cole gave a luncheon party
for Audrey Forth, whose marriage to pilot
Torn Warland takes place in Bombay at the
end of October. Her dad, E. E. Forth, is
going with her.
Ihe W.C.T.U. held its 49th annual con-
vention in Toowoomba, and gave the unfor-
tunate modern girl a few more raps.
The Ormonde brought along a big list of
homing Queenslanders. Mrs. F. A. Cold-
ham returned after
three years, in which
she managed to see
quite a good slice of
the earth, for she left
with a party of motor-
ists, and travelled to
Monte Carlo through
Darwin and by way
of Java and Malaya,
thence via bits of Asia
into Europe. The trip
took about six months.
She was in Jersey for
a year, where she met
a number of Austra-
lians, and returned
home via the Panama
Canal. She has gone
to Charleville to stay
with son Geoff and
his wife.
Also on board were
Mrs. D. M. Ferrand
and Miss Wollaston,
whose sister, Lady
Lockyer, spent the
winter here. They in-
tend to remain in
Brisbane, and have
taken a flat at In-
dooroopilly. They
have spent most of
the last 20 years
abroad, chiefly on the
Riviera.
W. L. D. Salkeld
and daughter Elspcth,
after a tour of Britain,
have come home.
They did most of
their sightseeing by
car; and Elspeth has
picked on North
Wales as her favorite
spot.
Enid Dickson, just
engaged, threw all her
friends into a flutter
by announcing that
she was to be mar-
ried almost immedi-
ately. F. E. Treut-
hardt, is the lucky
man, and the Ann-street Presbyterian Church
saw the wedding. The wedding breakfast was
eaten at the Anne Hathaway, which is deco-
rated, with panels done by the bride. Last
Friday the Royal Queensland Art Society lit
the primus and spread the festive sandwich in
honor of the newly-weds.
The staff of the Buranda infants’ school
hilariously passed the cream cakes at Rowe’s
in honor of Miss S. A. Hall, who has been
made Inspector of Infants’ Schools.
The Mothercraft Association, which owes
its being largely to Dr. Phyllis Cilento, helo
its annual meeting t’other night. It was
announced that arrangements had been made
for a series of lectures and demonstrations
on mothercraft at various technical and domes-
tic-economy centres in Brisbane. A presiden-
tial address sent all the way from Canberra
by Dr. Phyl Cilento was read. She pointed out
that maternal mortality in Queensland is almost
as high as it was 20 years ago, in spite of all
that science has done. Home Sec. E. M
Hanlon presided, and Archbishop Wand and
the Minister for Education (F. A. Cooper)
were among the speakers.
Charleville will reap a harvest from the cen-
tenary air race, even if few other towns in
Queensland do so. Alison McPhie, of Too-
woomba, has gone out to stay with Alice
Carter to watch the landing of all the
entrants who get so far ; and Claire Godsall,
also of Toowoomba, is staying with the Bill
Longwills. Charleville has every available inch
of accommodation booked, and the town
council is getting a camping-ground adjacent
to the aerodrome into apple-pie order, and
providing conveniences for the expected army of
thrill-seekers.
Justice Henchman and his wife will be wan-
dering south soon to be present at the wed-
ding of their son Humfry, who, on October 17
at St. Mark’s Church, Darling Point (Sydney?,
will wed Nancy White. Dorothy Radford is
to be the bridesmaid.
The musical coterie of the Brisbane Women’s
Club on October 2 held an afternoon. Mrs
G. L. Byth, the president, received the guests
with Mrs. Debnam. Lena Hammond and her
pupils provided the music. There was a choir
of 21 girls, and part-songs, duets and solos
—all classical —filled the programme. Lena sang
an “Ave Maria,” with Gladys Frost at the
piano and Marjory Stuart at the ’cello.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The sun, tired of its bad temper of the
previous Monday, shone down on winner
and loser alike on Ladies’ Day. Blue again
was the favorite, either altogether or in
spots or stripes. Shady hats once more
took the air. Mrs. Tom Rolih’s was
blue, worn with a black ensemble, and
Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow’s was white
with a black band. Ruth Allen’s had its
crown pinched into a peak (like the
cocked hat of a youngster playing sol-
diers). It was of black taffeta, and its
jaunty black quill had red and green
markings. Her black crepes sported a
lime-green sailor collar and red tie. The
mayoral lady was nut-brown suited and
hatted. The McKelvey lady was smart-
ness in black. George Fuller’s lady’s
wide-leafed hat had a rose crown.
Phillipa Stephen came in blue and
Helen in beige. Mimi Healy’s green
crepes had a yoke of black-and-white
checks. The medical Weston Mahers,
the Julian Simpsons and Barbara Knox
were others glimpsed on the crowded
stands. Anne Gordon had luck. She
backed Silver Rose simply because she,
in “The Rose Without a Thorn,” is
given a white rose by the King. Mrs.
Caro’s first appearance after her illness
was hailed with delight by many old
friends.
Saturday’s clouds resulted in the dress-
ing at the races being of the mixed-
weather variety. The short fur coat, the
fur cape and cloth coats hobnobbed with
the flimsiest of chiffons and printed silks.
The McKelvey lady was all blue. Betty
Grigson’s frock was pink ; her coat long
and blue. Kirrie Cade’s eye-veil was of
the longish variety. The Sheldon lady’s
coat was served with silver fox. Mrs.
Tom Owen was all black —dress, hip-
length cape and wide-brimmed hat.
Through the slits in the Walder lady’s
coat came glimpses of her gaily-patterned
floral crepes. Myrine Collins’s blue
coolie hat was a great success. Mrs. Bill
Crossing slung a silver fox over the
shoulder of her tailor-made. The
Knoxes, the Stephens and the Julian
Simpsons were again in the throng. Mrs.
Victor White’s black taffetas had a
pleated hem, and George Fuller’s lady
graceful as ever, placed a posy of field
flowers on the top of her straw hat. The
Governor and aide Gifford were there,
but not once were they glimpsed in the
vice-regal pew.
To the Union Club purred the most
dignified cars after the mid-week races,
and at four o’clock, just within the
entrance, Consett Stephen and Shep-
heard Laidley stood ready to greet every
arrival. Soon the azaleas-and dwarf
trees at the foot of the stairs were hidden
from view, so many humans there were
exchanging greetings and selecting an
orchid from the trays which attractive
waitresses submitted to each woman
guest. In the dining-room you found
great clusters of balloons had flown ceil-
ingwards and were held in leash by blue
and gold ribbons. The flowers were gor-
geous. Masses of yellow broom, gold
nasturtium, strelitzias, delphinium and
lupins, as well as carnations, roses and
mignonette, met the eye on every side. A
bird of paradise in purple, crimson and
blue flowers, his tail of golden broom,
decorated the table at which the Acting-
Governor and his wife, Dame Eadith
Walker, General Macarthur Onslow and
the bigwigs of the club sipped their cock-
tail or pekoe. A koala made of mignon-
ette gazed on the assemblage from its
perch in a tree. Among those who made
their first appearance of the day at this
party were the knightly Alexander
Gordon couple, the C. L. Joneses, the
Belgian Consular Segaerts, the Milner-
Gullands, Tom Bavin and his lady and
the Harry Budges. And among the
samplers of the sandwiches of many
fillings and of the delicious-looking ber-
ries that were really ices were Valerie
Bavin, Diana Davidson and Sadie and
Elise Budge.
Miles and miles of the best cars found
their way to that race-week fixture the
Matrons’ Ball at the Rose Bay Golf
Club. From them into the lounge
stepped well-groomed men and gor-
geously-arrayed women. Here the 35
hostesses (just as gorgeous) staged their
welcome against a background of massed
waratahs, flowering reeds and tulips.
Lilac languished on the tables, and the
verandahs were invitingly cool with
growing ferns and palms. The only blot
on the decorative escutcheon was the
scarlet arum lilies that seemed to fill the
horizon and by some freak of memory
brought back the picture of Lady Mac-
beth moaning about blood.
There was a serenity about Mrs. Pat
Levy’s grey chiffons, a sense of the
fitness of things about the orchids that
sprayed from the wing-like shoulder
straps of Mrs. John Keep’s dull-black
satins. Mrs. Alan Grant pinned violets
on her oyster satins with good intent.
Mrs. Scott Waine wore graceful prim-
rose satins. Mrs.
F. C. Thompson’s
magnolia satins
added glory to the
occasion, and
Nancy Houston
Beryl Osborne,
Goldie Gray and
Yvonne Parker
were four who
wove a pattern
into the night.
Just on 1000
swept out to
Moore Park for
the Randwick Ball.
This is one of the
really friendly
charity dances of
the year. As every-
one seems to know
everyone else there
is much visiting be-
tween groups and
nearly as much
chat as there is
dancing. Spring
flowers swooned
and languished on
every table, but
Clangor’s colors,
pink and green,
had pride of place
on its owners’ (the
R. R. Prices)
board. The Rand-
wick mayoral
couple, the S. G.
Paines, were in this
party. Mrs. B. B.
North and Mrs. B.
Payten kept the.
treasury, the one in
black, the other in floral crepes. The
president, Mrs. P. Hassett, was pleased
with her presentation basket of flowers,
and Margaret Walker and Mrs. R. L.
Conway sheathed their fountain-pens and
footed it with the best of them. Roman
Catholic charities benefit.
All the people who had been to the
races, the dances and cocktail parties of
the week turned up, this time with sand-
wiches in brown paper, in cardboard
box or in suitcase, to the Picnic Ball.
Here, in a garden of roses, trailing over
pagoda and pillar, 1600 ate their supper
and danced in the interests of the Home
for Incurables and the Sydney Day
Nurseries. The Murray lady was one of
the few who didn’t have to carry her
own supper. She ate what the committee
provided in a becoming powder-blue
gown and dangling earrings. Jeanie
Ranken was another of the favored
who sat with president Mrs. Hubert Fair-
fax, whose spray of tulips worn with
dusty-pink crepes won many an admiring
glance. The H. E. Mannings were also
in this group. Sec. Betty Higgins, in
blue satins, smiled over the night s
success. W. Skidmore, the hon. treas.,
was so busy his wife had reason to feel
neglected, but she bore up wonderfully
in blue and silver flamisol. Jean Cheri-
ton’s girls did a minuet. Mrs. John
Flaviell’s white chiffons patterned in pink
roses were worth every glance they got.
Diana Wentworth was graceful in high-
necked navy-blue taffetas. Claire and
Jocelyn Curlewis, Beatrice Fawsitt, Eva
Kuraz and Phyllis Skene were others
who thoroughly enjoyed the informality
of the whole affair.
Beth, the only chick of Mrs. A. B.
Crowther, slipped into matrimony by
way of the Manor Chapel, Mosman.
Ivory crepes, a froth of tulle and a
wreath of orange-blossom and native
white heath formed the wedding rai-
ment. The Rev. Harold Morton, assisted
by the Rev. L. Burt, put the usual lead-
ing questions to her and her bridegroom,
Frederick Hynes. He is the son of the
Frederick Hyneses, of Melbourne, and
his mother is the magistrate at the
southern city’s Children’s Court.
George Johnston did this pencil sketch
of Lela, third daughter of the J. M. C.
Forsayths, of Vaucluse. Their home,
Vaucluse Hall, is one of the foreshore’s
landmarks, and is renowned for its frangi-
panni-trees, which are perhaps the oldest
in Sydney. Lela does everything the girls
in her set are accustomed to doing.
Dancing, tennis and swimming are her
favorite sports, and she is intensely in-
terested in the drama. Immediately the
after-the-races-festivities are over off she
goes to Melbourne for the Cup and the
centenary gaieties.
If you were lucky you were asked
to Rear-Admiral Burges-Watson’s dance
the night before the Dunedin and Dio-
mede left for Melbourne. If you were
very lucky you were asked to come early
to dinner. At this the guests were mostly
Navy ; Jean Batten was one of the ex-
ceptions. The two cruisers were moored
alongside each other to provide a fairway
for the jazzing hundreds. When you got
tired of the Dunedin’s deck you walked
over the gangway to find out what was
happening on the Diomede. But the
bandsmen had to stay perched all night
on their platform hung over the water
between the two vessels. Awnings kept
out the cold breeze, and there were flags
and flowers in the ships’ buckets to
brighten up the landscape. The Admiral,
who is tall and handsome, is also a good
story-teller, so he is popular both as a
host and as a guest. His wife has also
made a place for herself in Sydney’s
naval and social circles. She wore for
this party white satins girdled in black.
The music of the Sydney Quartet.
Raymond Beatty and Marie Bremner
was like a soothing balm poured on
nerves frazzled by a week of races, cock-
tails and dances. This party at Elwatan.
the Robert Dixsons’ home, attracted over
100 guests, and after Pochon’s “Mill,
spots of Tschaikowsky and Haydn, and
Alfred Hill’s “Willie’s Old Trews”
everyone wandered into the walled
garden bodily and mentally refreshed.
In the garden the eyes were ravished with
roses and pansies and sweet-peas.
Azaleas in tubs made brilliant patches
near the doors of the house, and inside
hippeastrums, lupins, orchids and all the
glory of spring added their fragrance to
the afternoon. Mrs. Dixson’s black taf-
fetas had roses sprinkled upon them, and
her large black hat wore a pink and blue
rose where it turned up at the back. And
everyone sent kind messages to Mrs.
Walter Swinson by her husband and son
Ryder.
Not often is there such a gathering of
Place and Power at the wharf as there
was to meet the returning Governor, Sir
Philip Game, and his lady. Acting-Gov-
erribr Street and his wife were early
arrivals. Came the Church, the Navy,
the Army, Harry Budge and Lud Mayor
Parker, as well as numbers of friends.
Son Phillip, however, beat them all up
the gangway, and had a hundred
questions asked and answered before
Commander Gifford caught him up.
Among the first things Lady Game asked
was how did her garden grow?
If Mrs. Mowll —a twin soul as far
as a garden is concerned —has any luck
with the plants Lady Game has brought
her, the garden at Bishopscourt will soon
bloom with the anemone and scented
geranium prized by the vice-reine’s
mother.
Sheila Simpson had a home wedding,
but she dressed the part in full bridal
array of long-trained ivory moires. A
circlet of orange-blossom kept in place
the Brussels-lace veil (an heirloom in the
bridegroom’s family), and she and her
matron of honor both carried fans. The
reception-rooms were fragrant with
azaleas and spring blossoms, and vows
were exchanged under an arch of pink
and blue flowers. The bride is the second
daughter of the H. Simpsons, of Billyard-
avenue. The bridegroom is Murray
Wilson, of Vaucluse.
Hazel Usher became Mrs. Cal King
at St. John’s chapel at the Uni. during
the week. .She is the only daughter of
the E. W. Ushers, of Parawai, Vaucluse,
and the bridegroom is Dr. Cal King, only
son of Mrs. King, of Alma station.
Moree.
At last all the conjecture as to whether
the sapphire-and-diamond ring worn by
Madge Elliott since her return from Eng-
land had been given her by Cyril Rit-
chard is settled. Madge owned up to
everything last week, and is quite pleased
that her ring with its diamond steps and
stairs on each side was designed, bought
and paid for and worn before Princess
Marina got hers. The wedding will take
place in Sydney at the end of the “Blue
Mountain Melody” season. In the mean-
time the two favorites are being snowed
under with congratulations.
The naturalness and ease of manner
of the visiting 25 English schoolgirls are
rather disconcerting till you discover
some of them have been presented at
Court and have lived the life of a Lon-
don deb. for a season or two, and that
Switzerland and the winter sports are
part of their routine. Lady Forster’s big
farewell party in London (she is chair-
woman of the Victoria League) started
them on their joyous way. They have
played hockey in Fiji and have spent
eight days in Maoriland. The Wangan-
ella dropped them into Sydney on a
Sunday late, and the V.L. whisked them
to the mountains, where they found the
bluest of blue skies. They turned up
gay as larks to the V.L. tea party at
Farmer’s roof garden next day. Here
they met the hostesses with whom they’ll
stay on their return on the 14th. Before
sailing in the afternoon, they lunched
with Mungo MacCallum’s lady at the
Uni.

Melbourne
Chatter
The Mooltan brought Lord and Lady
Milne, Victoria’s first official guests.
Field-Marshal Milne has seen 50 years of
soldiering, is delighted at the prospect
of his Melbourne visit and declares he
feels as energetic as a young recruit.
Lady Milne is an enthusiastic worker
for the welfare of ex-soldiers’ wives and
children. Two days after her arrival in
Melbourne she was present at a meeting
of the R.S.S.W.M.U. She is fond of
music and the theatre, has brought her
golf clubs to Australia, and is anxious to
see how this country goes about the job
of growing such fine wheat and wool.
She has a fine collection of stamps, her
interest in this hobby not having waned
since her childhood. Lady Milne has
visited the West Indies, has travelled a
good deal in Europe, including trips to
Norway and Sweden, and knows some-
thing of South Russia and the Balkans,
having lived in Constantinople while her
husband was Commander-in-Chief of the
Black Sea Forces.
The Milnes have one son—he is in
England—and one daughter, the Hon.
Joan Milne, who accompanied her
parents and is at present the guest of her
father’s cousin, Mrs. E. M. Crossman,
of Punt-road, South Yarra. Miss Milne
is tall, dark and handsome ; she is fond
of sport, was educated in England and
went to a finishing school in Paris.
Sir John and Lady Cadman also
arrived by the Mooltan. Sir John is to
be found, when he’s at home, in the
sanctum sanctorum of the Anglo-Persian
Oil Co. He learnt his job from the
bottom upwards, starting as a tally-boy
in his father’s coalmine. He has studied
economics and likes to tinker with radio
apparatus. Lady Cadman has recently
resigned her seal in the London County
Council. Probably she needed the rest
of a long sea trip, for the life of a
councillor has taken up much of her
time. Lady Cadman’s initiation was a
sitting from 2.30 one afternoon until
breakfast-time the next day. On the
ship she was noted for her amazingly
smart clothes.
Two guineas per table does not pre-
vent people from playing bridge if the
party is a very social function held in
a beautiful home like Mrs. Harry Em-
merton’s Raveloe. Hers was an after-
noon-and-evening occasion in aid of the
Pioneer Women’s Memorial. The flowers
were really gorgeous ; their perfume was
wafted from a stall massed with color
through the ballroom, all white with
pear-blossom and arum lilies grown in
Raveloe’s garden, past the sun-room to
the billiard-room, splendid with gold,
mauve and pinky tulips. For the after-
noon party Mrs. Emmerton wore a wide-
brimmed black hat with a black gown,
its corsage elaborate with ecru lace. Sec.
Miss de Bavay had a decorative effect of
net upon her black dress. Among the
cigarette sellers was Mrs. Chris Cowper,
a cunning quill shooting from her beret.
Mrs. E. M. Cornford’s nutmeg dress had
a gilded ivy leaf nestling in a waterfall
frill, and Mrs. Len Buxton’s navy-blue
nailhead shoulder ornaments clinked as
she filled sweet baskets. Among the
players were Sheila Morell, in a fur coat
and a hat of the bonnet family, and Mrs.
Robert Hamilton, with daphne pinned
to her suit. Raffling the loving-cup
which was won by Mrs. H. C. Bundock
were Naomi Kennedy, wearing the new
season’s slit in her skirt, and Alison Reid,
in a spring hat and a pleated hem.
In the evening the billiard-table turned
its attention to supper instead of tea, and
champagne kept things sprightly in place
of cocktails. Among special guests were
Lady Milne, arresting in white lace, who
was accompanied by another overseas
centenary visitor, Mrs. Jackson, Sir John
and Lady Cadman (Sir John preferred
stories round the fire while his lady
played bridge), and the Hon. Mrs. Helrne
Pott, in a handsome gown with cleverly
puffed sleeves. The pink satin and coffee
lace nightie made by Hersey Brookes
goes into Felicity Syme’s trousseau, and
Mrs. Maurice MacGillicuddy’s raffle
ticket entitled her to take home an ex-
travagant cake, all marzipan cream and
bearing an ornamental and edible wind-
mill.
Old Collegians of P.L.C. held a dance
which gave the 1934 debs, an opportunity
of handing a presentation to Mrs. F. W.
Kitchen, to whom they made their bow
earlier in the year. It was a coincidence
that another school went dancing the
same night on the Rex’s second floor, so
a director of traffic was necessary to
divide arrivals into P.L.C. or C.L.C.
Mrs. Kitchen, wearing a black satin skirt
attached to a blue blouse, received a posy
of blooms and berries and a handsomely-
bound fund of information upon the
operas. Of the 14 chicks who flew forth
as this year’s debs, only nine were present
in their all-white frocks, the others being
afield in country nests. Coralie Gardi-
ner, in lilac and a cloak of a deeper
violet, and Bonnie Kellett, in floral chif-
fon under a gold wrap, saw to the balance
sheet. Beth Davidson was in black and
white crepe, and Myrtle Cloak’s blue
flamisol was of blistered surface. Bru-
nette Erica Gardiner wore pale pink, and
blonde Ailsa McDonald nettle-green
satin. Nancy Archer balanced a chro-
mium tiara upon her sleek head, while
Jean Rentoul wore honey-shaded organ-
die patterned with scarlet and blue
scrolls, her hair twisted into demure
twin knobs.
The Mooltan Ball on October 22 pro-
mises to be one of the biggest and jolliest
functions of the first week of the cen-
tenary. For people who prefer some-
thing less energetic than dancing, there
will be a concert in the music-room, and
bridge players may pit their wits in quiet
lounges under restful lighting. The whole
ship will be gay with flowers, for com-
mittee members without gardens are de-
termined not to let their botanically-
minded friends escape. Here is a Jack
Cato photo, of Betty Bellair, elder daugh-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Bellair, who,
with Roma Smith and Sheila Morel!,
makes up the trio of ticket secretaries.

the Mission to Seamen.
With a royal visit almost upon us an
older generation is dipping into its
treasure-chest of memories. When the
present King and Queen, then Duke and
Duchess of York, visited Melbourne at
the dawn of the century the Court was
in mourning for Queen Victoria, so every-
body who was anybody went into black
or purple. Even unofficial citizens who
saw no more of royalty than an eyeful in
a crowded street dressed in sombre hue.
Small girls with particular mammas went
about in orphanage-grey. The woman
with only gay and frivolous dresses in
her wardrobe found a garment with
a white or grey background, tied a black
sash round it and made hideous the life
of her dressmaker until something of
fashionable black was forthcoming.
There were no dances during royalty’s
visit, but there were weighty receptions,
at which Lord and Lady Hopetoun were
outstanding figures of poise and breed-
ing. Black and purple dresses cut very
lov/ in the corsage, tightly-moulded upon
pulled-in waists and flowing into long
trains were glittersome with real jewel-
lery (to wear imitation stuff was con-
sidered appalling taste —the woman who
owned no real gems pinned a rose at
her throat and another in her hair).
Garden-party hats were loaded with
feathers, and starched petticoats trailing
in the dust must have made long hours
for laundresses.
Morning, afternoon or evening dress
was specified on all invitations, for
utility coats and skirts were not worn
in those days. A woman who arrived
frilled and flounced and rustling to
Parliament House before midday was
viewed with cold disapproval, as was the
careless creature who wore plain un-
adorned linen to drink: tea at a G.-H.
garden party.
Everybody but a favored few who
possessed special passes had to arrive
at functions half an hour or even an
hour before proceedings were timed to
commence, for the streets were barri-
caded and closed long before the royal
carriages were expected.
To-morrow the bells of Christ Church,
South Yarra, will peal for Alison,
younger daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Pul-
teney Mein, of Binbinette, St. Kilda-
road, and Alan, elder son of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Stuart, of Lakes Entrance.
Athol Shmith’s camera has caught the
slim bride-to-be, who is one of Mel-
bourne’s most popular girls. Miss Mein
plays a great deal of tennis and rides
every day when she goes for holidays to
her father’s station in N.S.W. Her sister
Phyllis keeps the family flag flying at
golf. It’s to be an afternoon wedding,
and the cake will be cut at No. 9.
On account of Victoria’s birthday
party the Government, with a flourishing
“let-the-little-boys-out-of-the-corner” ges-
ture, has decided that men in gaol for
failing to maintain their wives may come
out and see the fun. There are 20
delinquents whose detention behind iron
bars costs the State £2OOO per year. The
wives are pessimistic, and think it highly
probable that the bad lads will eat too
much birthday cake, start climbing the
“totem-poles” and collect such swollen
black eyes before the Duke’s arrival that
they won’t see, though they might hear,
the high-jinks.
The Zoo also has its centenary celeb-
rity—a gentleman platypus with a pro-
digious appetite. Normally he weighs
21b., but after a meal must be twice
that, for he can swallow 21b. of worms
at a sitting. For his size, he’ll be a com-
paratively expensive addition. A pit for
holding thousands of luckless wrigglers
has been built at the Zoo, and small boys
(and girls) may obtain free entree, plus
6d., for every treacle-tin of squirming
titbits which they collect for his larder.
The visiting English schoolgirls are
“doing” Melbourne. Seven P.L.C. lasses
with whom some of the visitors are stay-
ing arranged a young things’ dance at
Carronhank, the Kew home of Mrs.
Graham Balfour, which was filled for
the occasion with peach- and pear-
blossom, daffodils and gorgeous tulips.
Frances and Eirene Balfour, Mar-
garet and Alison Gillespie, Joan Latham,
Barbara Balderstone and Wilsie Rowell
each wore a special floral adornment, a
mark of being a hostess and a director of
ceremonies.
“Visit to Clyde” has been noted in
the diaries of the visitors. Clyde Old
Girls motored the young travellers up to
Woodend, where the principal, Miss K.
Tucker, was ready to welcome them to
one of Victoria’s best-known schools.
There were a picnic meal on the golf
links, an inspection of the school and
in the afternoon a drive to Macedon.
Edith Thompson, who shelters the Eng-
lish girls under her wing, is a friend of
Miss Henderson, a former Clyde head-
mistress who now lives in London.
The N. S. Wales bridge champions
stepped off the train at Spencer-street
station to make the acquaintance of a
gloomy Melbourne Sabbath ; a cold wind,
tramless streets and no newspapers.
However, there was compensation in the
cheery affair of the evening, the official
welcome at Kallara Bridge Club. Mrs.
Irwin, wearing black lace and chiffon, re-
ceived nearly 100 people of varying grades
of bridge proficiency in rooms joyous
with holly, roses and lilies, both virginal
and kalsomined. Guests enjoyed a
friendly game of bridge without the
strain of match play. Besides the men’s
team from N.S.W. there are five women,
from among whom a team will be chosen
to compete against Vic. in the first
women’s inter-State match ever held.
Preliminary skirmishes started on
Monday, and November 1, in the Mel-
bourne Town Hall, will see the largest
rally of duplicate contract players that
has ever been arranged in Australia.
Mrs. Douglas Cooke left these shores
as a bride, and has returned to show Mel-
bourne to her two younger daughters,
Diana and Rosemary. Mrs, Cooke does
a good deal of public speaking, and
keeps things alive in her M.P. husband’s
constituency while the House is sitting.
Her son is in the Army, and there’s an
elder daughter at home who is to be
married next year. Mrs. Cooke is a
daughter of Mrs. James Burston, of
Myoora, Toorak.
The catalogue of the Vic. Artists’
spring show was decorated with a frisky
lamb (somebody wanted to know where
was the mint-sauce). Mrs. Jimmy Dyer
performed the opening and with Theo-
dore Fink, Dr. Ivan Maxwell and H. S.
Gilkes bought a picture by Kenneth
Leask. The canvas will be given in
turn space on each of its joint owners’
walls and eventually come to rest in
some country gallery. Among those who
meandered through the rooms was Mrs.
Louis Smith, who wore black and an
interesting necklace—bold scrolls at-
tached to strands of ink-blue lacquered
string. The Kingsley Hendersons were
there ; also “Uncle Fred” Newman, Mrs.
E. S. Jackson, in a white fur coat over
black velvet, and Leigh Murray. Greta
Harrison came face to face with her
purple-clad self upon the wall (a picture
by young J. V. Govett). Wallace Ander-
son lent his sculptor’s hand towards
carrying up coffee urns. When they
arrived the curtain on the dais parted
dramatically to reveal tables of cups and
food against a background of “Art
Union Is.” pictures.
The efforts of half a dozen Meldrum-
school painters came out of electrically-
lit studios to the broad daylight of the
Athenaeum. The Mayor performed the
opening from a specially-constructed
dais (usually the opener of Athenaeum
shows balances himself on a chair or
stool or finds a point of equilibrium over
the piano). There were a few beards
present, but only three or four male
heads could have mustered enough locks
for a really decent bird’s nest. The Mel-
drumites (who can’t help doing unusual
things) puffed at pipes, cigarettes and
strange evil cigars right through the
opening speeches. Mrs. C. Edgeworth, in
brown with a white bib, looked attrac-
tive. A young woman in purple had a
flippant bunch of lace under her coat.
Black shoes were worn with blue stock-
ings and summer hats with fur co?ts.
One man wore 10 hairs on his upper lip
and a thick golden tuft in the middle of
his chin.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
The Sussex, bearing the Duke of
Gloucester to these shores, came along-
side to the minute in perfect weather.
A dense throng in King’s Park saw the
Duke place a wreath on the war
memorial and heard him reply to the
Lord Mayor’s address of welcome. He
has the Cambridge accent. Then the
cavalcade moved through the city to
Government House, with mounted police
leading and lancers in the rearguard.
In the afternoon mounted Hunt Club
members acted as a guard of honor at
the showground. The Duke inspected the
grand stock parade, displayed lively in-
terest in a Shorthorn bull and questioned
the beast’s keeper. He sipped tea with
president Piesse.
Seventeen hundred dancers took the
floor at the Legacy Club Ball at Gov-
ernment House. The central attraction
in the foyer was a cone containing speci-
men wildflowers. The Duke arrived at
10 p.m., inspected the naval and military
guard of honor and was welcomed by
the patron of the Legacy Club, General
Talbot Hobbs, and his lady, she in gold
and silver lamd. President J. D. Rogers,
with Mrs. Rogers, in Patou-pink armure,
was in the offing. Six junior Legatees,
three boys and three girls, in white and
silver, presented an address of welcome in
a casket and a gold club badge. The Can-
berra’s band marched to the centre, played
and then retired. The ducal arm
piloted Acting-Governor Jimmy Mitchell’s
daughter, Mrs. Terence Anketell, whose
trained gown of silver lace had a green
velvet bow at the waist. Betty Hobbs
sported blush-pink embossed velvets, and
Betty Griffiths-Bowen danced in plum-
bago taffetas.
The Duke decreed dinner jackets for
the informal dance at the Silver Stock-
ing Cave, Yanchep. The guests, who
included 60 fair maids of Perth and
officers from the Sussex, Canberra and
Australia, walked from the hostel to the
Cave around the lake, turned into Fairy-
land with colored lights. The Duke
dined at the hostel with the Yanchep
entertainment committee, and descended
the carpeted path to the cave at 10 p.m.
There was an informal singing of “For
He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” in lieu of
curtsying.
The lights in the cave were con-
cealed behind rocks, and the orchestra
was in gipsy garb. Supper was a con-
tinuous buffet affair. The royal visitor
took the floor with Bess Edwards, who
sported gold-embossed satin. Mrs.
Edwards chose burgundy-wine velvet,
and Jean Loton danced in white and
silver. The guests returned to Yokine,
but the Duke remained at Yanchep.
On his visit to the Repat. Ward at
Perth Hospital the Duke encountered a
former messmate. For the opening of
Anzac House 2400 Diggers assembled at
their new headquarters. Prince Henry
inserted the key in the front door after
making a brief speech, and then went
on a tour of inspection with Lieut.-Col.
Olden, chairman of the building com-
mittee.
On Perth Oval Scouts and Guides
staged a welcome to the Duke, who
laughed heartily at the encounter be-
tween St. George and the Loch Ness
monster, and saw a chariot race and a
corroboree. He wandered among the
children for a while, and took the salute
for a march past at the conclusion of
the programme.
The march through Perth by the
Grenadier Guards’ Band drew hordes of

by his better-half’s pool of blue velvets
to receive the guests at the portals.
Knight George Pearce and his lady were
there, her black satins covered with _ a

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The Duke’s impending visit over-
shadows everything. There’s to be a civic
reception on Friday morning, and an-
other to the Guards’ Band on Saturday
morning. The Lud Mayor’s Ball is on
Friday night in the Town Hall. On
Saturday the Citizens’ Ball will be held
in the Town Hall to entertain the officers
of the fleet, and the Moulden lady is
staging a bal masque at her residence,
Lordello, North Adelaide, the same
night, at which she will entertain mem-
bers of the Duke’s suite. On Monday
there will will be a special race meeting
at Morphettville, and a reception in the
evening at Government House.
The third meeting of the Adelaide
Music Salon passed off most successfully
at Birks’s Piccadilly. So many members
brought friends that over 250 were
present, though we’re in the midst of a
’flu epidemic. Marian Hardy and Harold
Tideman sang, pianist Jean Finlay and
violinist Lewis Jones were heard and
Mrs. Arthur Williamson, Jean Barbour
and Joyce Rofe were accompanists.
A cheery party was held at the South-
ern Cross, when 14 young Adelaide
matrons joined forces and dined to-
gether prior to attending “The Merry
Malones” at the Theatre Royal. Dinner
was served at-a long table in a special
room, and the floral decorations were
beautiful.
In the interests of the Lud Mayor’s
Relief Fund a bridge party was held at
Ashgrove, the home of Dr. and Mrs. G.
R. West, Prospect. Over 200 were
present. There were 35 tables in the
long ballroom upstairs, which was fitted
up to look like the deck of a ship. Other
tables were in the reception-rooms on
the ground floor, and all were beautifully
decorated with flowers. Dorothy West
and several friends, wearing sailor caps
with Ashgrove on the band, sold sweets.
Prof. H. J. Wilkinson auctioned several
pieces of tapestry that Dr. and Mrs. West
had brought back with them after a
recent visit to Asia.
A crowded attendance at the ball in
the Palais Royal brought the Business
Girls’ Competition to a close. The com-
petition has added £2775 to the Lud
Mayor’s Relief Fund, all in penny votes.
Miss Mase, nominated by the S.A. Rail-
ways, polled 77,777’ votes and headed
the list. Lud Mayor Cain came accom-
panied by his daughter, the Acting-
Mayoress, Mrs. H. Dunstan, in black
lace. The 31 contestants had each been
given a box, where their supporters ral-
lied round, and each was presented with
a diamente star on a fine diamente chain
as a badge. His Ex. and Lady Dugan
arrived at 10 p.m., Lady Dugan in pale-
pink chiffon. The contestants were then
lined up and presented to the vice-regals.
TASMANIA
His Ex. and Lady Clark motored up
to Wynyard for the A.I.F. Ball. Major
E. Lewis welcomed them, and they were
entertained at dinner by leading resi-
dents.
A committee of girls ran a well-ar-
ranged dance at Belfort’s Cabaret in Girl
Guide interests. Decorations were all in
Iceland poppy shades. Molly Magrath
did the secretarial jobs, and there was a
good muster.
Launceston’s efforts for the Bush Nurs-
ing Fund included a dance got up by
young folk at the Kai Pai tea-rooms and
a big bridge party at the J. A. von
Alwyns’ home, where magnolias and
pink camellias decorated. At the dance
the color scheme was blue and gold.
Yvonne Bashford was hon. sec.
The dinner given by the Southern Tas.
Golf Union to the northern players was
a very bright affair. Over 150 guests sat
down to the tables at Hadley’s. Mrs. C.
E Webster, president of the Southern
Women’s Association, welcomed the
northern women players, and Molly
Jones, the northern captain, made a witty
response.
The H. S. Drurys have left the Speck
to settle in Melbourne, to the regret of
a large circle of friends, and have been
guests at a round of farewell parties.
Lynn Drury, handsome and popular, was
guest of honor at several tea and bridge
parties given by girl friends in the last
week or so before leaving. More formal
gatherings were arranged by married
hostesses for her mother.

Financing
Australia’s Trade
Throughout the World
PRACTICALLY the whole of Australia's great
export and import trade is financed by the
Trading Banks.
Wool, wheat and other products sold to buyers
in Great Britain, Italy, Japan and other countries
are paid for by the Banks in Australian currency
when shipped from Australian Ports, the Banks
collecting payment in British or foreign currency
after the shipments reach their destination.
For goods valued at, say, 100 British pounds a
Bank pays the Australian Producer 125 Australian
pounds. The 100 British pounds, when received,
become part of that Bank's London funds and in
due course are made available to an Australian
importer who requires funds in London to pay
for imports. The importer pays 125£ Australian
pounds for the 100 British pounds in London.
Thus the Bank's gross profit on the buying and
selling transaction is 10/- in Australian currency
of which a considerable proportion is paid away
in salaries and office expenses.
This is one of the many services rendered
to producers, merchants and the community
generally by the Australian Trading Banks.

Putting the Brakes On.
BY-
DR H.L. TONKIN
Although most bids in contract are in-
tended to be constructive, it is obvious
that every deal cannot play to a game.
Some means must be adopted of allow-
ing a player to make a bid and subse-
quently conveying his opinion that no
game can be made. This is the “sign-off”
bid.
In the first edition, of Culbertson's
Blue Book no provision was made for
these calls; every time either player
spoke, added strength was inferred.
Later, the safer methods of Mr. Sims
were recognised, and in the 1933 Blue
Book we find: “A sign-off bid is a
warning to partner that the hand, al-
though previously bid, is below his mini-
mum expectations in honor strength, and
that any further calling by him is at his
own risk. This bid is recognised by the
fact that (a) the responding hand has bid
and then rebid its suit at least twice ; and
lb) the ‘sign-off’ is always at the range of
three bids in the suit. It applies equally
to major or minor suits, and is generally
made when responding to partner’s no-
trump, although it may be used after
partner’s suit bid. ‘Sign-offs’ are re-
stricted to the responding hand. The
bid shows one honor trick or less in the
hand, and a six- or seven*card suit.”
Here is an example where a player can
issue a warning to his partner that, not-
withstanding the powerful hand on one
side, there should be no game for the
combination, and a penalty is looming
up if they persist.
South. North.
INT 2S
2NT 3S
Now consider the alternatives which
North had. He might have passed ; he
might have bid three no-trumps or four
spades. Yet he has merely repeated his
spade bid. If he held a fair five-card
spade suit, with one and a half to two
honor tricks, he might have passed two
no-trumps; with a slightly all-round
hand, he would have raised it to three.
With strength concentrated in the spades
and a shortage, he would have bid four
spades. He has done none of these
things, so the only conclusion his partner
should draw is that North feels fairly
certain there is no game in sight, and
that it is safer to play with spades as
trumps.
Examination of dozens of duplicate
boards during these last few months re-
veals that far too many match-players
are not conversant with the principles of
“signing-off.” It is either done on the
wrong type of hand or it is not recog-
nised by the partner when called on the
correct holding. This weakness in the
partnership bidding outfit may be easily
repaired if two players get together for
half an hour and run over a dozen or
so of the situations where a “sign-off”
can be used.
Giving One for Two.
In my young days, when I played
draughts, I often found the expert con-
ceding one piece in order to rob me of
two or three. My friend, Mr. Bertram
Flohm, applied this principle to contract
the other night in the play of’a difficult
hand.

North’s call is perfectly honest. East
[•attempts to put up some defence with
;his overbid, and South is justified in giv-
ing a voluntary raise. West tries to bluff
opponents with his bid of two no-trumps,
intending to retreat to three diamonds if
doubled. Mr. Flohm, sitting North, con-
sidered doubling, but decided to go for
the game. Review of the hands shows
that his judgment' was sound, as East-
West would only sustain a two-trick
penalty in diamonds and 250 points
would be poor compensation to North-
South for the loss of the game. West’s
business double of three spades may look
unsound, but, as the cards lay, it deserved
to pay.
East Opened with a small heart, won
by the knave in dummy, as trumps
should obviously be led through West.
The fall of the heart ten from West sug-
gested that it was either a singleton or
the start of an echo. Mr. Flohm con-
sidered the possibilities in the former
case. West probably had king and queen
of trumps. If he held all four outstand-
ing trumps, and were allowed to win the
first or second round, he would make
three out of his four trumps by putting
East in twice with a diamond lead and
ruffing two hearts. Mr. Flohm led the
spade ten from dummy, which was cov-
ered by West’s queen, and won by
North’s ace, revealing East’s void. Now
a small club was played to South’s ace,
and returned. When the club king won,
a third round was taken, South discard-
ing a diamond. The trick was conceded
to East-West in order to save two tricks,
and make the contract safe. West is now
in the lead. He can put his partner in
with a diamond in order to get the heart
ruff, but it can’t be done twice. By
North’s play a losing club trick is ex-
changed for the losing diamond, and a
ruff on the hearts is saved. Of course,
if East had held the top club, Mr. Flohm
could not have landed the contract, but
he took the line which gave him the best
chance.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
M.L. (Potts Point, N.S.W.).—All the
hands which I have given so far have
occurred in actual play. They have either
come under my own observation or have
been recorded for me by friends who
can recognise unusual and interesting
deals. As you say, not many of these
intense deductive plays featured in bridge
periodicals are found in the published
records of international matches.
R.B. (Melbourne).—The hand you
sent has caused some discussion among
my friends. Here it is:
Disregarding all suggestions of so-called
“psychic” spade or heart openings, the
problem boils down to: How many clubs
should be called? Two clubs were sug-
gested ; others pointed out that certain
specific cards must be held by partner in
order to produce the game. Some hailed
it as a Sims three-bid, which is wrong,
for the hand does not contain game in
itself. Under the Culbertson system, I
think the best opening is just a simple
one club. Any response from partner
can be forced with four no-trumps. If
he fails to disclose the missing two aces,
the bidding stops at five clubs, which
should be got. If he is unable to answer
one club, then there is no game.
J.C. (Chatswood, N.S.W.).—In rubber
bridge, as well as in competition play,
accurate knowledge of the scoring and
a nice estimation of the playing tricks
are needed in order to judge the price
you are paying when making your over-
bid. Experienced players are certainly
more inclined to bid their hands to the
limit.

Reveals a Strange Mystery: —
THE COLORS
OF
WRIGLY BURBLE
By Bernard Cronin:
ILLUSTRATED BY FRITH.
WRIGLY BURBLE’S boyhood was
fairly uneventful. One incident,
however, is worth recording, as
a hint of those extraordinary conditions
which were shortly to set him apart from
his fellows, and brand him as being
unique in the annals of medical science.
Returning home one afternoon after
a strenuous three hours’ battle at a city
remnant sale, Mrs. Burble staggered into
the yard to discover Wrigly engaged
in a game of cigarette-card swaps with
the undertaker’s little boy. Her shrieks
aroused the neighbors.
In reply to the line of heads which
presently ornamented the dividing fences,
she could only point with a trembling
finger to the face of her child. It was a
dark purple, bordering in places on
black. So were his hands. In fact, when
later undressed and put to bed, by order
“Her shrieks aroused the neighbors.”
of a baffled and irascible lodge doctor,
it transpired that he had taken to him-
self this abominable and unnatural hue
from the top of his head to the soles of
his feet.
The odd part of it was that Wrigly
gave no reactions to sickness. He as-
serted violently that nothing was the
matter with him. Examination bore him
out. His temperature and pulse were
without blemish. He had no pain. He
continued to demolish his meals with all
his wonted gusto. The lodge doctor
could make nothing of him, and said
so —heatedly. It was his private opinion
that the boy had contrived, during his
mother’s absence, to indulge in a bath
of blackberry juice. The lodge doctor
had a single-track mind. It made no
difference to his theory that blackberries
were out of season.
BURBLE, senior, eager for his tea, and
finding an unspread table and a
house full of chattering woman, shouted
for particulars. The lodge doctor had
gone home. Since everybody else had a
theory, no two being alike, Burble,
senior, was speedily bewildered. He
shouted once more —this time for
silence. Always having been a good
unionist he couldn’t understand how a
son of his should be declared black.
He went at once to Wrigly’s bedroom
and sternly questioned him. By this
time the boy had receded to a faint
plum color. Having been allowed to
survey himself in the looking-glass he
was also somewhat subdued and appre-
hensive. He felt the need for admitting
at least a part of the truth.
Yes, he had played truant from home,
in spite of his mother’s strict instruc-
tions not to stir from the yard during
her absence. Freddie Fishwick, the
undertaker’s little boy, on being bribed
with cigarette-card photos, of Greta
Garbo, Syd Coventry and the Crested-
tailed Robin Shrike, had agreed to show
him the inside of his father’s chapel and
mortuary, there being no clients
in occupation at the time.
The adventure had proved a
great disappointment. There
was nothing to see except a lot
of big black curtains and a
big black couch. And did he
Burble, senior—think that he —
Wrigly Burble—was, so to
speak, going bad? Because
Freddie Fishwick’s cat had
turned black after it had been
dead for a week, and Mrs. Fish-
wick had said that it was going
bad and had better be buried
before the health inspector
came around.
Burble, senior, having calmed
these childish fears, departed to
his tea, more mystified than
ever. The affair was a nine
days’ wonder and was then for-
gotten, except by the lodge
doctor, who sent an account of
it to the “British Medical Journal,” in
which he advanced the further theory
that the root of the whole thing was a
morbid psychological projection of the
boy’s mind to the coming blackberry

mitted. Then
it appeared in
full force,
pursuing its
victim to the
final tragic scene, as will be presently
related.
At the age of twenty-one Wrigly had
attained to some distinction as a porch-
climber and petty-larceny expert. The
police had his finger-prints and his
number. He had been a guest of their
Majesties on several small occasions;
breaking bread with the very elite of the
underworld. He was an only child, and
both his parents were dead. It irked him
at times that he had no one left of his
own family to feel proud of him. The
Burble- tradition recorded many left-
handed occupations, but until now it had
never succeeded in getting into the artist
class. Until Wrigly’s triumph the record
had been
held by his
great-grand-
pa, Giles
Burble,
who was a
plumber.

and timely. One late afternoon he
secreted himself in a thick shrubbery
close to the residence of the Curator in
the Botanic Gardens. Quite by chance
he had on a suit with a greenish tinge,
with a cap of the same material. The
significance of this will presently be
apparent.
At around the hour in question the
Curator’s house was usually deserted. The
Curator himself was absent in the course
of his duties, his wife was shopping in
town or calling upon friends, and his
children were dawdling on their way
home from school. On the numerous
occasions when Wrigly had spied out the
land he had seen no sign of a maidser-
vant. Naturally he assumed that there
was none.
His long wait in the shrubbery prior
to entering the Curator’s house was not
due to a fear of finding the place occu-
pied, but because a couple of gardeners
were working in the vicinity. When they
finally moved away Wrigly lost no time
in gaining the shelter of the porch.
He had just succeeded in prising open
one of the old-
fashioned windows,
when the calm air of
evening was shat-
tered by a piercing
shriek.

Why we have two sets
of teeth; what to do to
make them strong and
keep them healthy;
why some children eat
chalk or mud; how to
protect teeth from de-
cay after they come
through the gums.
PB«MA?<ENT TEETH
Milk is one of the finest foods known
for building hard teeth because it is
rich in calcium .
A drawing of a child’s jaw showing
how the permanent teeth form be-
neath the baby teeth and gradually
push the latter upward until they
loosen and come out easily.
The roots of baby
or first teeth are
gradually dissolved
and absorbed by
the body, probably
to be used again in
building the per-
manent teeth. J toots
of second teeth are.
not absorbed.
THE celebrated first tooth
that causes mother such
excitement and gives father
such pride is really months old
when it breaks through the
gums. For we now find that
teeth begin to form months
before birth and continue to form long
afterwards. Thus scientific men now
believe it possible to actually "build”
strong teeth by having the baby as well
as the adult eat the proper food.
The harder and thicker the enamel of
the teeth, the more resistant they are to
decay. Therefore nutritionists tell ex-
pectant mothers to eat plentifully of
foods containing lime and phosphorus
and certain vitamins so that the baby
will have good teeth. They advise
mothers to feed children tooth-building
foods in large quantities. Milk, oranges,
cod-liver oil are some of these tooth-
building foods.
Dental science explains that decay is
caused by particles of food that lodge on
teeth and under the edges of the gums.
This food is spoiled by certain bacteria.
As it decays, acids are formed which
destroy tooth surfaces. After eating
through the tooth's hard enamel cover-
ing, these acids proceed to decay the
inner part of the tooth until finally the
nerve is reached and the entire tooth
affected.
One of the scientific methods
of preventing decay after
teeth have once come through
the gums is to remove from
teeth the film, or bacterial
plaque. Film is that slippery,
sticky substance that forms on
teeth. You can feel it with your tongue.
Film is a friend of the germs that cause
decay-producing acids. It glues germs
to the teeth, provides them with a warm
shelter . . . even supplies germs with
food on which to live and multiply.
Thus removing film from teeth means

progress in removing film was made
recently in the laboratories of The Pepso-

ary cleansing material was developed.
The cleansing and polishing material
is the part of any tooth paste that does
the work. Most cleansing materials are
so hard and abrasive that they scratch
the/tooth enamel. Here is the difference
between the best tooth paste and in-
ferior brands.
The new Pepsodent cleansing material
is twice as soft as the material com-
monly used in tooth pastes. Pepsodent
Tooth Paste is unsurpassed in cleansing

That is why Pepsodent is known in
67 countries as the >( special “film-

earthquake off the coast of Japan, and
five pieces of plaster fell from the ceil-
ing of the Curator’s wife’s drawing-room.
When Wrigly recovered from his
paralysis he fled. As he approached the
lawns he saw gardeners converging upon
the house from all four points of the
compass. Escape was impossible. It
only remained for him to halt where he
was and wait to be apprehended. Con-
sequently he stood stock-still at the
middle of a flower-bed where he hap-
pened to be. This was in accordance

with his fixed rule never to exert him-
self in behalf of other people. If they
wanted him they could fetch him.
WITH growing amazement he realised
that so far, at any rate, he was
overlooked. Ermyntrude Spinks had by
this time issued into the open, where she
fainted in the arms of the youngest and
best-looking gardener. Whilst she was
being carried back to the house two of
the men walked in Wrigly’s direction,
beating the shrubberies as they came.
They halted presently within a few yards
of him. Their spirited conversation
reached him clearly.
“Funny where the bloke’s got to. Must
be somewhere close ’andy.”
“Yairs.”
They were turning away when one of
them pointed directly at Wrigly.
“Strike me, where’d that come from?”
Wrigly’s heart gave a sickening leap.
He was on the verge of making a dash
for it, when the reply came:
“ ’Struth! That must be the noo cactus
the Curator wrote fer to Mexico. I
thought it wasn’t to be ’ere till Thursday.
Bill muster planted it.”
“Better get' the ’ose going arter and
give it a drop of water. Looks a bit sick,
don’t it? Well, come on.”
A SHORT half-hour later Wrigly walked
homewards through the thickening
dusk. He couldn’t make head or tail of
what had happened. He had a terrified
feeling that he was going mad, that the
whole thing had existed only in his
imagination. He knew he wasn’t good
looking, but it seemed impossible he was
so utterly “off” as to be mistaken for a
Mexican cactus. Thoroughly bewildered,
he was in the act of turning into a
hotel for a drink to steady his nerves,
when he caught sight of his reflection in
the advertising glass at the side of the
door.
His face was pea-green.
He hastily looked at his hands. They
also were pea-green. Pulling up a
trouser-leg he investigated further. The
result was the same. Everywhere he
looked pea-green flesh greeted him. In
sudden panic he pulled his cap over his
eyes and set off again at a run. He did
not pause until safe in his own room.
It was not long, however, before the
amazing truth forced itself upon him.
There was no doubt about it. He was a
human chameleon. He changed his color
in accordance with his surroundings,
whenever the color of these was pro-
nounced and his stay therein was suffi-
ciently long to bring about the necessary
chemical change in the pigment of his
skin. His enforced wait in the shubbery
and the lucky circumstance that he was
wearing a greenish suit and cap had
effected his salvation.
The ordinary man would possibly re-
gard such an extraordinary physical
attribute as a distinct drawback. But
Wrigly Burble was not an ordinary man.
The potentialities of the thing were enor-
mous for one of his persuasion. To be
able to change one’s color at will was,
he clearly saw, the next best thing to
becoming altogether invisible.
He determined to set about a series of
experiments as soon as his immediate
color had subsided. In order to hasten
the process he made a kind of cabinet
for himself with the sheets taken from
his bed. At the end of an hour he was
almost normal. He attributed the fact
that his skin still retained a certain dingi-
ness to the overdue appearance of his
landlady’s washing-day. In other words,
his sheets had been much whiter a fort-
night earlier.
During the next week Wrigly confined
himself to his room, on the plea of ill-
ness. He had previously provided him-
self with rolls of brightly-hued paper,
each of a different color, with which he
constructed a number of small peaked
tents. Sitting inside these in turn, before
the sunlight streaming in at his window,
he accomplished the whole of the pri-
mary colors and a number of fairly satis-
factory blends. No chameleon could do
more.
IT remained now merely to supply his
wardrobe with costumes correspond-
ing to the details of the scheme he had
in mind. This effected, he proceeding
to commercialise his peculiarity. The
metropolitan police force shortly began
to scratch its head over the activities ol
a gang of late-afternoon, porch-climbing
thieves, composed apparently of repre-
sentatives of all nations. Agitated house-
holders made the wires hum with reports
of encounters with West Africans,
Chinese, Red Indians, Australian abo-
rigines and others. As though crime had
suddenly gone mad on color, reports ap-
peared in the papers concerning a puce-
colored burglar seen escaping from a
house in Brighton, a green bag-snatcher
at Moonee Ponds, and a gentleman
striped like a zebra removing the gas
fittings from an empty cottage in Rich-
mond.
These evidences of a while Australia
induced a great deal of public uneasiness.
One arresting theory was that the coun-
try was being overrun by a master or-
ganisation of international crooks, con-
trolled by an Indian Mahatma who sat
on a bench in a Bombay park, and sent
out vibrations. How this story came
about nobody knew, but the psychic
journals seized on if with avidity.
In the meantime Wrigly Burble was
fast amassing wealth. The pace, how-
ever, was growing too hot. It was all
very well to confuse the police and
public in this way, but everything has its
limits. Besides, his skin was growing ex-
ceedingly tender from the continual ex-
pansion and contraction of its pigment
cells. The colors showed a tendency to
run a little at the edges, so that one

cheek would sometimes insist upon re-
maining yellow, while the other blos-
somed into a delicate shade of orange
or burnt umber.
In the circumstances Wrigly wisely
decided to make a last and extremely
profitable coup. For a whole week he
rested his pigments, during which time
he carefully reconnoitred several likely
prospects. He decided finally upon the
premises of Hector Bottle and Com-
pany, the well-known Lane importers of
Oriental jazz dress-materials.
These people were known to be notori-
ously old-fashioned in many of their
business practices. They were in the
habit of merely locking their loose cash
in a drawer of old Mr. Bottle’s office
desk, which also often contained some
of his wife’s jewellery, particularly if the
day had been hot. Mrs. Hector Bottle
enjoyed spending her husband’s money,
but found summer shopping a little try-
ing when weighed down with large quan-
tities of precious stones, gold and plati-
num bracelets, and other symbols of a
simple and unostentatious life.
THESE facts, and many others, had been
gleaned by Wrigly from Mrs. Bottle’s
personal maid, whom he was courting
in the character of the Sultan of Zanzi-
bar’s eldest son, who, after attending
Eton and Oxford, had been sent to Aus-
tralia to finish his Western education at

the Footscray Technical School. Al-
though a little timid of the magenta color-
ing which Wrigly had decided to adopt
as being suitable to a native of Zanzibar,
her highly romantic nature permitted her
to accept the story without question. His
Highness Prince Cuspidor Ab Domen
of Zanzibar and Sardinia loaded her
with costly presents, and took her to the
pictures regularly twice a week.
This cruel deception brought no
qualms of conscience to Wrigly Burble.
Indeed, as he crouched behind a pack-
ing-case in the storeroom at the rear of
the premises of Bottle and Company,
just before closing time one wintry even-
ing, he had completely forgotten that
such a girl as Jessica Smallweed ever
existed. He had turned himself com-
pletely black for the occasion, and wore
a black suit. He was part' of the night
itself. Even when a hurrying employee
passed within a bare foot of him, he
knew no alarm. Never had his pigment
cells functioned so perfectly.
When all was quiet he made his way
to the main building, with the aid of a
pencil torch. He had little need for cau-
tion, for the night-watchman did not'
commence duty until eight o’clock, and
it was now not quite seven. He had a
whole hour at his disposal. He spent the
first ten minutes of it ransacking the
desk in the office. It' was a good haul.
He felt so pleased, in fact, that he de-
cided to remain awhile and see what
else of value he might discover.
The most momentous happenings are
often germinated by a triviality. Rome
was saved by the cackling of geese.
Wrigly Burble was destroyed by the
crackling of a door-hinge.
THE door—set in motion by a draught
in the building—belonged to a
sample-room. Someone had left it open.
And now he made a further discovery.
The warehouse, as has been said, was
thoroughly old-fashioned. It had re-
mained pretty much as it was for over
half a century, except that the original
gas lighting had given place to electricity.
The fittings even here were antiquated.
The light switch, instead of being inside
the room, was on the outside, in the
corridor; after the manner adopted still
for large wall safes. It took him some
time to find it. Having switched it on
he stepped inside the sample-room and
looked about him.
Quite evidently a new shipment of
Oriental jazz designs had just arrived.
Every color of the rainbow seemed
to be there. They were so loud as
almost to be heard. Some of the stuff
had been partly unrolled, and was spread
over trestle tables, or hung across the
walls. Seen in the glare of the electric
bulbs the kaleidoscopic effect was over-
powering. The room was swamped with
it. It blinded.
At the moment of recognition a heavy
step sounded from the corridor beyond.
The nightwatchman, as it afterwards
transpired, had been hunted by his wife’s
tongue to an early refuge. Before he had
time to turn a corner and see the strip
of light issuing from the sample-room,
Wrigly pulled the door shut. Only then
he realised that it fastened with a spring
lock.
IN dismay he stared about him. There
were no windows. He saw nothing but
a sea of color. It surged about him in
great gouts of red and green and yellow,
like a spectroscopic nightmare. The
footsteps had passed on. Michael
Moroney, all unconscious of the impend-
ing tragedy, had ascended morosely to
his den in the top storey; there to com-
pose biting retorts for the morrow’s
resumption of his domestic warfare,
until kindly sleep set him snoring in his
chair.
Wrigly had given over shouting and
hammering on the fast-shut door. Al-
ready his senses were deserting him. He
was dimly aware that strange processes
were taking place somewhere inside him,
but he was too sick to bother about it.
It would scarcely have comforted him to
know that his pigment cells were being
slowly driven mad in the attempt to
adjust themselves to the shrieking colors
that enveloped them. His tortured flesh
heaved this way and that. He felt him-
self swelling until he filled the whole
room, then dwindling to a mere pin’s
head. In their struggles to compromise
his pigments had ended by bursting.
THE charwoman found him in the
morning. Until she turned it over
she thought it was a piece of old Per-
sian carpet.
A. Crime Story That Is Different: —
FREEDOM
BY T. W. O'B.
“/ could never understand the friendship
that existed between those two —at least
it was not until it was all over that /
formed a theory that might, have fitted
Dick’s motives. Freedom’s reactions
were true to type, God knows.”
FROM the day he first entered
the police force, Miles
Freedom must have made it
his first rule of life to miss
nothing that might help him in his pro-
fession, which was to nose out criminals,
to hunt them down, and then, as he put
it himself, “to fit them with the job.”
He was always on duty, in uniform or
out of it, at home or abroad. He had
been married out of his own district, in
his wife’s home town, and had inter-
rupted the course of his own marriage
service to arrest the verger, whom he sud-
denly recognised as one who had fled
from justice some years before.
His comrades in the force swore that
he slept at night with his wife’s wrist
handcuffed to his own.
Freedom was a gross animal, big
muscled, big boned. He had neither in-
tellect nor culture, but his primitive in-
stincts were developed to an extraordi-
nary degree. The chief of these was
observation. He could track like a
blackfellow, and he had an unusual
memory. It was not only faces that he
remembered, but habits, movements,
gestures.
“You now, Doctor,” he once said to
me, “I wouldn’t need to see any more
of you than the back of your legs from
the knees down. You walk with your
feet flatter and more turned out than
most people, and you always lift your
right foot a little higher than your left.”
I didn’t know this myself, but when
I asked Dick Manton to watch me walk-
ing he laughed and said it was quite true.
IT was through Dick Manton that 1
came to know Freedom, who was a
plainclothes man then in our little moun-
tain town. I could never understand the
friendship that existed between those two
—at least it was not until it was all over
that I formed a theory that perhaps
might have fitted Dick’s motives. Free-
dom’s reactions were true to type, God
knows, and obvious enough. Dick flat-
tered him cleverly—flattery that was
really thinly veiled sarcasm, a contemp-
tuous laying bare of the primitive mind
to whoever might be near to see its ugly
nakedness. At times I thought that
Manton had really gone too far, but he
knew his man, and under it all Miles
Freedom boasted loud and more loudly
of his successes, and purred like a
softly-stroked cat.
There could not have been a greater
contrast between two men, for Manton
had a deeper knowledge and a fuller
understanding than anyone I have
known. His mind was as bright and keen
as a finely-tempered sword. The only
thing they could possibly have in com-
mon, I thought, was courage. But even
in this there was little similarity. Dick
was mentally and physically reckless. He
lived dangerously, delighting to go to the
very limit of safety—and a little beyond
it. Freedom’s courage was purely physi-
cal, and he took no unnecessary risks. It
was, however, beyond question, and
strangely enough the one virtue about
which he never boasted. I really be-
lieve that he didn’t know he was brave,
that fortitude was so much a part of his
physical make-up and so little a thing
of the mind that he did not see danger
as something to be feared, but as some-
thing to be avoided when possible, like
sickness or drink or love of women, be-
cause it might interfere with his effi-
ciency.
When the trouble over the coalmines
came, and for a week or two our little
town was in a state of siege, with bar-
ricades across one street and pickets
around the pithead, it was Freedom,
revolver on hip, who went into the middle
of a howling mob of utterly uncontrol-
able men to arrest Jan Hooseman for the
killing of the mine manager. But it was
Manton who saved Freedom’s life when
Freedom lay stunned by a blow from a
pick-handle, helpless and at the mercy
of a score of iron-shod boots lifted to
kick his life away. It was Dick Manton
alone and unarmed who stopped the
crowd by the sheer audacity of his laugh-
ing “Wait a minute!” —bluffed them for
just long enough to allow him to grasp
the policeman by the collar and drag
him through a doorway to safety.
WITH this between them perhaps it
was no wonder they sought each
other’s company ; but, still, they had been
friends before that. It was beyond me.
I knew that at the bottom of his heart

Dick had the greatest contempt for the
animal that was Miles Freedom. He
showed it a dozen different ways. I
remember saying to him once:
“If ever an incentive were needed to
keep me from a life of crime, it’s there
in the thought that I might get myself
into the power of a brute like Freedom.”
Dick looked at me curiously.
“What are you afraid of?” he said.
“A smashed nose and a bruised body?”
“Not that altogether,” I told him,
“though it would be unpleasant enough
to be at the mercy of his hands. What
makes me shrink is the feeling that his
hateful mind in all its ignorant grossness
would be dealing with my fate.”
Dick laughed.
“Don’t let that worry you,” he said.
"He hasn’t got a mind—only instincts.
If anything stopped me from trying
myself against Miles, it would be bore-
dom. The trial wouldn’t be interesting.”
“Then why on earth do you hobnob
with him like an only brother?”
“Oh, he’s not a bad chap really, and
1 can always get amusement out of him.
His very name makes me chuckle—a
policeman named Freedom!”
THERE the matter might have rested,
and I would never have formed my
theory, if it had not been that one day
I travelled with them both to the city
and back in Manton’s car.
Freedom had to go down on a case
in which I, too, was called to give evi-
dence, and Dick Manton offered to drive
us both down. I readily agreed. I liked
to watch Dick driving. As in everything
else, he drove to the very limit of safety,
but somehow you never thought of that
until afterwards. He was always so
sure and so brilliantly exact that the only
feelings I got from it were envy of his
ability and mental exaltation. Not so
Freedom. With the great laugh that
always punctuated his sentences, he told
me:
“Get in front, Doctor —get in front. I
always sit behind when this man drives
—can’t see what’s coming then, and I
feel happy.”
No imagination, absolutely none. If
he didn’t see a thing, or hear a thing, or
feel a thing—well, it just didn’t exist.
On the way down Dick was chaffing
him. It seems that they had had several
trips to the city together, and that on
each occasion Freedom had been lucky
enough to run into a “wanted” man. He
spent every spare moment he had while
in the city poking around pawnshops
and low hotels on the off-chance of
picking up information, or something
even more direct. '
“You won’t have much, chance to bag
a ‘wanted’ to-day,” Dick told him. “They
won’t let you leave court until four
o’clock, and I want to start for home
immediately afterwards.”
“Oh, >there’s the dinner hour,” Free-
dom said. “A lot can happen in an
hour, you know.”
r\ICK met us at four o’clock.
** “Well,” he asked Freedom, “any
luck to-day?”
“Just as I thought,” the detective said.
“The doctor and I fitted our man with
the job—manslaughter— ten years he got
—Ho! Ho! Ho!”
The case had been a sordid one, and
particularly vicious. I had not been
sorry to hear the man receive his well-
deserved sentence, but my evidence had
been purely technical, and I resented
Freedom’s implied statement that we had
worked together for the criminal’s un-
doing.
“But you broke your record, Free-
dom,” I said rather snappishly. “You
didn’t lay any other poor devil by the
heels this trip.”
“Ho! Ho! Ho! ” he laughed again.
“There’s plenty of time, Doctor. We’re
not home yet.”
jyi ANTON’S car was an open tourer,
and as a rule he drove everywhere
with the hood down, but this morning
rain had been falling when we left home,
so the hood was up and the side curtains
in position. The drive home, with Dick
at the wheel, usually occupied exactly
two hours and twenty minutes.
We had not been more than half an
hour on the road when I noticed an im-
mense spider clinging to the underside
of the hood immediately above my head.
I dislike spiders intensely, and, my first
impulse being to prevent its falling on
to me, I took off my hat and, turning
it quickly upside down, pushed it up
against the hood. That -was all right so
; the spider could not fall on me or
escape; but my next problem was to
persuade or force it off the hood into the
hat. The question was quickly settled by
Dick, who gave the top of the hood a
sharp slap with his hand.
- That 11 shake him down,” he said.
Now open the door and heave him
out”
I managed very successfully, and we
were soon on our way again. Freedom
leaned forward with his arms resting on
the back of the front seat and his bullet
head between Dick and me.
“There’ll be another around some-
where,” he said; “they always go in
couples. That proves you haven’t had
the hood up for some time. They’ve pro-
bably been living in a fold of the closed-
up hood, but they’re quite harmless, that
breed.”
Dick gave a grunt.
“Harmless or not, I don’t like ’em. If
you can nose out the mate, I don’t mind
stopping the car till we get rid of him.”
WE had not been delayed for more
than a couple of minutes, but Dick
was just that much behind his schedule,
and evidently determined to make it up,
for his foot went down on the accelerator
and the car gathered speed and flew.
Away we raced over the steep and
winding mountain road, the rear tyres
screeching a protest at every corner. We
thundered to the top of a high ridge,
bucked over the sharp saddle-top and
dropped down the other side like a stone
flung into a pit.
There was a sharp right-hand turn at
the bottom of the long hill, and as we
swung around it I thought my hour had
come. Almost in the middle of the road
there was a broken-down lorry loaded
with coal and, just beyond it, coming
towards us at a fast pace, another car.
1 did not shut my was no
time ; they remained wide open, staring.
It seemed that nothing could save us.
1 remember wondering which course
Dick would choose—to crash into the
back of the lorry or into the front of
the approaching car.
He did neither —he went through !
There was a quick juggling of throttle
and brakes, the back of the car skidded
first to the right, then to the left, there
was a light scrape along the left running
board, and suddenly a clear road was
before us and we were running down
again with unchecked pace.
Dick’s hands were steady on the
wheel.
Miles Freedom’s head pushed itself
between us again, and Dick turned to
him with a flash of white teeth.
“Well,” he said, “did you see that one
coming?”
For once the detective did not laugh.
“I did,” he said soberly. “I thought
there was only one man tiving who could
drive like that.”
I WAS feeling strong reaction to danger
past —relieved, excited and friendly
towards those who had shared the ex-
perience with me, even towards Freedom.
I asked him:
“Where is the other super-man to be
found?”
“I don’t know,” he said. “1 wish 1 did,
Ho! Ho! Ho! He’s wanted for murder.
Went by the name of Tranter. He’d been
a racing driver in the Old Country. I’ve
never seen him, but his driving was
famous —did some wonderful things.”
“I’ve heard of him,” Dick said.
“Didn’t he kill a man out west some-
where?”
“Yes—and got clear away with it.”
“They didn’t try very hard to find
him, did they?” Dick asked. “From
what I heard of it the man well deserved
killing.”
“That’s not for me to say,” Freedom
said, and added sententiously: “He is a
criminal, a murderer, and as such he has
put himself outside the pale. There is
a warrant out for his arrest, and it is
the duty of every honest man to appre-
hend him when possible.”
Dick Manton laughed.
“Oh, go to hell!” he said. “That’s
fifteen years ago. Why worry about him
now? He can go free so far as I’m con-
cerned.”
“How is he to be recognised?” I asked
Freedom. “Have you got his finger-
prints and photographs and all that sort
of thing?”
“Not much record,” Freedom said. “A
description, yes, but a very confusing
one. The sort of thing that would fit
anyone. And photographs! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Two photos.—one in racing kit.
muffled up to the eyes and wearing great
goggles and gloves. If only he’d had his
hands bare there might have been some-
thing about them a good man could
recognise.”
“You said there were two photo-
graphs,” I said. “Was the second as use-
less as the first?”
“Yes,” Freedom snapped. “It didn’t
show his face at all.”
THERE was yet another incident dur-
ing that drive which, small though
it was, has left behind a more horrible
memory than our flirtation with death on
the hillside. We, or rather Freedom,
caught the other spider.
We had been running silently for miles.
I don’t know what 1 was dreaming about,
but I remember noticing subconsciously
that the rear vision mirror was twisted
slightly, so that I could see reflected the
whole of the back seat of the car. Auto-
matically, for .1 still went on dreaming my
dream, my eyes registered the fact that
Freedom had leant forward, had
stretched out his left hand and had
grasped the collar of Dick Manton’s coat
while his right hand hung poised above
Dick’s head. Then, quite clearly and
with understanding, I saw the spider
drop into the opening between Dick’s
neck and his collar.
No! Even now I could not swear to
it, could not be certain that Freedom
shook the spider off his finger on to the

neck. It all happened so quickly, and,
as 1 said, I was daydreaming.
The man must have had wonderful
faith in Dick’s nerve, for we were run-
ning at close to sixty miles an hour. But
then he had had good proof of it more
than once.
Anyway, he wrenched back the coat
and shirt, and, plunged his hand down
Dick’s back, saying,
“Don’t move! I’ve got him!”
The hand came - slowly up again, with
the great fat-bodied spider between finger
and thumb, and then —I felt physically
ill —the thumb and forefinger closed
tightly. He opened the door, flung out
the lifeless carcass and wiped his fingers
on the mat on the floor of the car.
Dick Manton pulled his scarf closely
around his neck and shrugged his
shoulders. His shirt was torn from Free-
dom’s clumsy efforts, and his collar-stud
had flown loose. I picked it up after-
wards on the running-board. No matter
what the weather Dick would never have
the curtain on his side up. He said
quietly, “Thank you, Freedom.”
WE pulled up beside the police station
to let Freedom out. He walked
round to the side of the car near Dick
and leant over the door.
Then it happened. There was a sudden
flash of steel, a metallic click, an oath
from Dick, and he was sitting hand-
cuffed with Freedom’s great hand on his
shoulder.
“The game’s up, Tranter,” Freedom
said ; then, turning to me, “I’ve kept up
my record after all, Doctor. Ho! Ho!
Ho! That bit of driving started me
thinking, and then the spider gave me
the opportunity I wanted. I didn’t tell
you that other photo, was one of his
back—a big stitched scar —he’d had a
driving accident.”
Brutally he thrust Manton’s head for-
ward, dragging back the coat and shirt.
There clearly on the while skin of Dick’s
back I saw a long zigzag scar.
Have You Ever Had This Advice?: —
Cantgetbakfromthere.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
CANTGETBAKFROMTHERE? It’s
the other side of BilUbangerwon,”
said the man called Baldy.., He
gazed thoughtfully at the station waiting-
room. fire.:
“It’s nearer Bunberrumbora,” said the
man called Jim.
“Maybe,” assented Baldy after deep
thought. “Might be five or six miles
nearer. But then you’ve got to cross
the ridge at Bellybruyoung going that
way. Any’ow, you get out at Carribom-
bery.”
CANTGETBAKFROMTHERE had
N-' been mentioned in some yarn one
of them had been spinning. We were
grouped near the waiting-room fire, and
1 had asked casually where the place was.
That had started it. For my part, the
place I wanted to get to was Sydney.
“Yairs, you get out at Carribombery,”
assented Jim. “That is, unless you”
“No ; you get out at Carribombery,”
put in the man in the corner, Bill. “Then
you go along to Coolawarra. ’Bout
twenty miles.”
“That ain’t the best way,” objected Jim.
“Go to Nambanki—that’s my idea. Then
you go from Nambanki to Boodleton.”
“Best way is to go to Boodleton
through Coolawarra,” objected Baldy.
“Not if Old Lawler is still running the
coach to Nambanki. Anyone know if
Lawler is still running the coach to
•Nambanki?”
'“FHEY argued about it. I dozed off,
1 vaguely hearing the argument, which
seemed to decide that Lawler was his
own son who still drove the coach not
for the last eight years.
I was pretty well fast asleep when
somebody prodded me and said:
“You get off at Carribombery. Then
you get to Boodleton either through”——
“Yes, I follow,” I said hastily.
“Then you go on from Boodleton to
Cantgetbakfromthere.”
“Not by a long shot, you don’t!” said
Baldy impressively.
“You’d git lost,” said Bill. “No; after
leaving Boodleton you make for Jerri-
pompom”—
“Fletcher’s homestead’s belter,” said
Jim.
“Fletcher’s homestead was burnt out
in 1925, and he threw up the lease,” said
Bill.
“Oh, then, of course, Jerripompom.”
“And after that,” I mumbled, “you go
to Bunberrumbora”
“No, you don’t. Bomboona is the
best way,” said Baldy. “Thirty miles
or so”
“I’d go by Sherrit’s Creek,” said Bill.
“Supposing it was running a banker?”
demanded Jim. “No ; Flinders’s place
for mine.”
1 DOZED while they argued that pojnt.
* Somebody awoke me again by say-
ing:
“You get off at Carribombery”——
“After leaving Sherrit’s Creek,” said
Bill, “you make for Poodlehampton.”
He paused to look a challenge at
Baldy and Jim; but this time they
nodded an assent.
“That’ll do me,” I said hastily. “1
daresay I’d find my way from there if
ever 1 needed to.”' J '• J ‘
“You’d have to go from there to Har-
rigan’s,” said Bill.
“Not if you wanted to strike Billiban-
garwon,” said Baldy. ’ “The best way
would be to get. to Slattery’s.”
“That’s near Billibangarwon?” I asked.
“Slattery’s? No; a hell of a way off.
From Slattery’s you’d have to go to
Minnewanta and then strike across to
Wimble’s. Then, if there hadn’t been
any rain and the road was passable,
you’d make Tintinby, and from there go
on to Swabblehurst. After that”
“To go from Poodlehampton to Riggle-
stones’d be better,” said Jim.
“I alius went by Pipplepool,” said Baldy.
THEY started to argue again, but the
rumble of the train ended that.
They turned out on to the station with
me; and then I discovered that they
were not travellers. They were merely
locals who came to the railway station
to get a little hectic excitement by having
a conversation in the waiting-room.
“You get out at Carribombery,” said
Baldy, as the train to move.
“That is unless you; want to get to
it by the other way round,” said Jim,
trotting beside the'mpving caravan. “If
so, you get off at”
“You get off at Carribombery!”
shouted Bill as the train really moved.
Looking back, I saw that they were
still arguing. Anyway, I was going to
Sydney.
Ballade
Of Laissez-faire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
Sweet, as the sea's sound haunts this shell
I hold amidst your locks in play,
Life haunts our love: for,-truth to tell,
So much was gold which is but grey.
, So, let us laugh, nor seek to stay
The flowers that fall, the days that fly;
Though times and chances change and slay,
Give we to Grief a gay good-bye.
• - . ii. ■ :
Make of your rosebud mouth a bell,
■ And sing me songs both grave and gay:
Of lovers twain who. sinned and fell
From grace beneath the Serpent’s sway;
Of grace we know much less than they,
But while our laughter can defy
The God they once dared disobey—
Give we to Grief a gay good-bye.
. . ' , ' 111.
The Persian told how Philomel
Soft breast against sharp thorn did lay:
So that those poignant strains might swell
Where sadness strove with sweetness. Nay;
r That bird could thus in frenzy flay
Impassioned breast, we do deny;
So soon does passion’s rose decay—
Give we to Grief a gay good-bye!
IV.
Alas, my Sweet, that I must sell
My songs for gold and silver —yea,
And dream fair dreams, constrained to spell
Their lore for cash to souls of clay!
Come, laugh, my Sweet —at least we may
Share dreams too fair to cost a sigh;
And since for these no price we pay,
Give we to Grief a gay good-bye.
V.
Now, lest we, learn to love too well,
And Life' at -length to Loss betray
The' rose-lit‘ realms wherein we dwell,
Of "all" our’ gods'their gift we pray—
That Mirth, shall reign supreme for aye
In hearts where Love may droop and die:
Therefore, though Love should die to-day,
Give we to Grief- a ’ gay good-bye.
L’Envoi.
My Sweet, our youth flies fast away—
The days of rose-and-gold go by;
But while we still with Folly stray,
Give we to Grief a gay good-bye.
TASMANIA.
ERIC MOORE.

SHEEPSKINS FOR BOOKBINDING
Instead of casing its books in orthodox cloth binding, The Endeavour
Press has tested the possibility of using tanned Australian sheepskins
for the purpose. The result is a lemarkable credit to local crafts-
manship. A special autographed and numbered edition of Brian
Penton’s “Landtakers” has been produced in this richly unique bind-
ing. Specimen books can be viewed in Sydney at Dymock’s, David
Jones’s book counter, Moore’s Book Shop and Preece’s Book Shop.
As the edition is confined to 23 copies only, all first impressions, it
will doubtless be a source of interest to collectors of limited and
special editions. The price is two guineas each, and Bulletin readers
who would like to procure one of these valuable books should write
to any of the above retail shops or direct to
The Endeavour Press, 252 George Street,
Sydney.
