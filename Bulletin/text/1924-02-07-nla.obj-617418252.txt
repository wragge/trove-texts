The Red Page
Rhyme and Repetition
Frank Morton once advocated in this page
the study of the old French fixed forms as
“crutches” for the lame beginner in verse
to teach himself to walk with. It is hard
to imagine an ultra-modern poet laboriously
climbing the repetitions of a rondeau redouble
or the 28 circumscribed ladder-rungs of a
ballade, until he reaches the shining heights
of free verse with, say, Amy Lowell or Ezra
Pound, and can proudly give the world some-
thing like this: —
. . . !, n.y.
My City, my beloved, my white!
Ah, slender,
Listen! Listen to me, and I will breathe into thee
a soul.
Delicately upon the reed, attend me!
Now do I know that I am mad,
For here are a million people surly with traffic;
This is no maid.
Neither could I play upon any reed if 1 had one.
The last line is significant, though not alto-
gether so in the case of Ezra Pound, for
when he chooses he can play skilfully enough
with sonnets or canzoni. But one is driven
to suspect that many new writers declare
they “will” not play upon the reed when
the auxiliary should be “can,” neither do
they know that they are mad. So they set
off noisily smashing regulations they hold
in profound ignorance, disregarding the
advice of Beethoven that it is well to learn
rules in order to break them.
The argument that writing to rule is excel-
lent discipline for the recruit is true enough,
but it is more than that. As Frank Morton
himself said, “It takes a certain skill to
write a ballade that would pass muster at a
tinkers’ revel”; and it takes high skill, and
brains and heart behind the skill, to pro-
duce wholly successful imitations of the
old French or Italian forms that look so
delightfully spontaneous when they are
finished. After all, readers outnumber writers
—even in ink-spattered Australia —and
the important thing is that they should have,
when they wish it, that' charm of repetition
musically managed, that awakening of a
rhythmical expectation of ear and mind and
its satisfaction, conveyed by kyrielle, bal-
lade and triolet, chant royal, sestina, ron-
deau, villanelle and virelai. Those writers
who have been most addicted to them, Austin
Dobson, Andrew Lang (with a forgotten song
for Australia in his “Ballade of the South-
ern Cross”), Gosse, Henley, Swinburne,
George Moore, George MacDonald, J. K.
Stephen, are all masters of technique. To
read them is to realise how variously beauty
can be presented in such narrow moulds, and
how even there the writer’s personality re-
fuses to be hidden.
A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere
With craft of delight and with cunning of sound
unsought—
anyone would know the touch of Swinburne’s
fingers. George Moore’s egotism smacks
complacent lips in his “Ballade of Lovelace.”
Choice of subject reveals Austin Dobson’s
penchant for the 18th century, George Mac-
Donald’s curious mingling of religious and
fairy mysticism, the clever “cheek” with
which J. K. Stephen veils his sensitiveness.
At first the appropriate themes seem to be
light ones, the playful-cynical, the gallant,
the artfully-artificial. Look at some out-
standing titles : “The Pompadour’s Fan,” “In
Teacup Times,” “A Flirted Fan,” “On a
Nankin Plate” (they have a pretty affinity
with fans and old china), “Of Antique
Dances,” “With Pipe and Flute,” “Of Ladies’
Names.” We all know the moods when we
fly to the relief of trifles and thank our
smallest twinkling stars for such verse col-
lections as “Ballades in Blue China,”
“Rhymes it la Mode” or “Bric-a-brac.” Yet
the careful and self-conscious lines lend them-
selves well to a more serious vein. 'They
always did. One of the earliest proofs of
this is Villon’s despairing ten-rhymed ron-
deau : “Mort, j’appelle de ta rigueur!” The
rondeau redouble has a sober reflectiveness,
“a dying fall,” that suits it well for such a
forlorn hope as “I will go hence and seek
her, my old love,” by Graham Tomson.
Austin Dobson perpetrates a wistfully beau-
tiful untruth in his roundel:—
Love comes back to his vacant dwelling,
The old, old Love, that we knew of yore 1
and the warning “Tune quaesieris” is very
gently reiterated in a villanelle:—
Seek not, O maid, to know
(Alas, unblest the trying!)
When thou and 1 must go.
The same writer, who gives us the “Chicken-
skin, delicate, white” daintiness of the Pom-
padour’s Fan, has done a fine chant royal
on “The Dance of Death.” Henley has left
a lovely rondel that begins:—
The ways of Death are soothing and serene,
And all the words of Death are grave and sweet.
The American H. C. Bunner wrote a grue-
some rondeau on the theme, “Les morts vont
vites,” and another American has even writ-
ten a ballade with the burden: “From battle,
murder and sudden death!” which at least
proves that the last line must not neces-
sarily begin with “where” and end with a
note of interrogation. No doubt it is the
easiness of the question refrain that evoked
the criticism of a parodist:—
In ballades things always contrive to get lost,
And Echo is constantly asking where
Are last year’s roses and last year’s frost,
And where are the fashions we used to wear?
All the same, the “where are” ballades, from
Villon’s “Where are the snows of yester-
year?” to Allan Marris’s poignant indict-
ment, “Where is your Shepherd, oh, Sheep,
Black Sheep?” include some of the best of
the series.
As Chopin has expressed every human
emotion from grief to mockery in the strange
little scope of the mazurka-form, so in these
elaborately airy constructions some hundred-
odd rhyme-stringers present to us devotion,
flippancy, tenderness, satire or sorrow. And
they give us also humor and burlesque. When
the old French forms rushed into fashion in
England about the time that Gilbert ridi-
culed in “Patience,” when Henley made even
the Cockney coster confess in ballade-wise
I keeps a Dado on the sly;
In fact, my form’s the Hloomin’ Utter!—
Lang and Bunner and Austin Dobson wrote
parodies and made fun of themselves and
their friends with the same strict care that
enabled J. Iv. Stephen to boast meekly: —
Dear Sir, though my language is low,
Let me dip in Pierian pools;
My verses are only so-so,
Hut 1 hope 1 have kept to the rules.
And even Science the austere succumbed, and
“had a go” with a “Ballade of Primitive
Man” (Lang) and a “Ballade of Evolution”
(Grant Allen).
At the best, perhaps, they are all of them
trifling, but the Cult of Little Things needs
really no defence. The hills have room for
the wood-violet as well as for the mighty
mountain-asli. The orchestra that reverently
plays the Ninth Symphony does not disdain
the “Dance of the Sugar-plum Fairy.”
Poetry is in no way lessened because a
reader who loves “Paradise Lost” loves also
a triolet on the Launching of an Autumn
Leaf. The fixed forms offer us a double
pleasure, so that sometimes we forgive the
slightness of the theme for the excellence of
the workmanship; sometimes we overlook
the flaw of a repeated rhyme-syllable for
the beauty of the thought; now and again
we meet the rare joy, of the two perfections.
And for that ordinary reader whose name is
legion they have the sweet appeal and subtle
flattery of being so easily remembered. Let
any doubter experiment with the “deliciously
impertinent triolet,” and try whether he
needs more than one perusal to remember for
all time, say:—
Here’s a flower for your grave,
Little love of last year;
Since I once was your slave,
Here’s a flower for your grave.
Since 1 once used to rave
In tiie praise of my dear,
Here’s a flower for your grave,
Little love of last year!
ELSIE COLE.
Science and Spirit
“In many respects Crookes was unique in
my experience of scientific men,” writes Sir
Oliver Lodge in a “Foreword” to Dr. Four-
nier d’Albe’s Life of Sir William Crookes
(Fisher Unwin). “He belonged to the class
which has done such first-rate work in Eng-
land, a class each member of which began
as a scientific amateur and forced his way
to the front by sheer ability and brilliance
of discovery.” Crookes’s life—he was born
in 1832 and died in 1919 —covered a period
of scientific development unequalled in his-
tory, and to that development he was a
large contributor. He came to his life’s
work much as did Faraday, the book-
binder’s apprentice. Joseph Crookes, his
father, was a country tailor with an ambi-
tion to storm London. And to London he
went, made his way into Regent-street, be-
came a well-to-do shopkeeper, and begat many
children. Of the children, numbering 16 —
and these by a second marriage—William
was the eldest. Joseph gave them the middle-
class education of that day. Later, some
followed the family craft of the tailor, others
were placed elsewhere. Of "the 16 William
alone showed no aptitude for any solid call-
ing within the old man’s outlook. In de-
spair at his son’s inability to elect some com-
monsense vocation, he yielded to filial press-
ure. William’s one desire was to become a
“chemist.” Not a sound chemist, in a shop,
with prescriptions to make up, but a vague
sort of being who did things in a laboratory.
Joseph lived to the age of 92 years, and saw
his son in the fulness of success. And of
him wrote the son : “He was the best father
that ever lived, and his sons have everything
to thank, him for.”
Crookes, at 16, entered the Royal College
of Chemistry, then working for the relief of
the depression in agriculture. The marriage
of the young queen to a German prince had
brought Germany into favor, and at the head
of the college was Professor Hofmann, under
whom the young student followed chemistry
as applied to agriculture. With two years
of this training Crookes launched on the
sea of science, putting in, as it were, to
every port, and pressing on to the Unknown.
There is a touch of romance, of high adven-
ture, here that holds the attention and ex-
cites the imagination. One can picture the
eager spirit tracking down the green line
in the spectrum of selenium till he wrests
from it a new element, Thallium. He named
it from a Greek word picturing the tender
green tint of young vegetation. “The green
line is superb!” he exclaims. Through the
dry light of science flashed a ray of the
beautiful.
In those days, and it may be true of later
days, man could not live by science alone.
At the back of research dn the laboratory
lay the pressure of editorial and journalistic
work, and, in later days, business complica-
tions, patent-right worries, even a libel
action, a distracting environment for a man
of science. And it is not in the laboratory
but at the editor’s desk that we find the
first trace of the “soaring of Crookes’s inner
mind into the realms of the supernatural,
his first excursion into the ‘debatable land’
between life and death which he trod with
such audacity—and such peril to his scientific
reputation—lo years later.”
In 1863 he became a Fellow of the Royal
Society, and 50 years later, having lived
down the assaults of a host of assailants,
was elected its president. His election to
the Fellowship was made “with considerable
hesitation,” wrote a contributor to the
Quarterly Review; and the conservative
and orthodox might well have regretted the
admission of this freelance when he essayed
to bring the scientific world to a formal
approval of the occult phenomena grouped
under the American denomination of
“Spiritualism.” Huxley has said: “The
scientific imagination always restrains itself
within the Ijmits of probability.” Faraday,
before him, had made a similar limitation.
But it was characteristic of Crookes, lack-
ing the conservative tradition of science,
that on occasion he burst impetuously
through the restraints of probability and
ranged the terra incognita beyond. Out of
this unknown land he brought sometimes
treasure, sometimes dust. “Spiritualism”
became a society craze in England in the
early ’seventies. Evangelists from the

tions, even under the most trying circumstances.
A clear explanation is given of how one man can

It explains the handicap in business and society
that timidity places on you, and how to over-
come it.
PERSEVERANCE: How to Develop It
Of all the modern “keys to fortune” none more
easily turns the tumblers of the lock than Per-

may develop it in yourself. How to exercise
self-control; how to throw off worry and fatigue;
how to keep fresh, keen and enthusiastic for

create, apply itself to any task you will —these
and many other phases of the subject are
explained for you.
OPPORTUNITIES:
How to Make the Most of Them
This is an inspiring and suggestive branch of
mental efficiency which shows how fortune and
good luck are nothing more than seizing oppor-
tunities that present themselves, or going
ahead and making the opportunities yourself.
How to know a good opportunity and take the
fullest advantage of it; how to acquire resource-
fulness; how to handle every situation so that
you may make of it an opportunity to gain some

and how to acquire them —every phase of per-
sonality building and exercising is explained.
Remarkable suggestions as to how to “arrive” in
society or business are offered.
INFLUENCE: How to Exert It
It is your personal influence on your associates
that determines your place in life, and to be
successful you must exert it intelligently. This
volume explains how to concentrate all the laws
of mental efficiency in the building and exercis-
ing of your personal influence; how to assume
and hold authority; how to develop personal
magnetism and self-confidence; how to com-
mand your associates, sway an audience, per-
suade those you meet to your way of thinking;

then take the wisest course; how to weigh
advice and judge its value; how to dispel illu-
sions and overcome unwise impulses; how to

tions; how to train yourself to be governed in
all your actions by common sense —these and
many other phases of the subject are explained

it, etc.
SPEECH: How to Use It Effectively
The expression of many of the powers of the
mind depends largely upon your ability to use
speech effectively. This volume shows you how
to talk to win in every phase of life—whether
in a dinner-speech, in a social conversation, or a
platform, in a business interview, or anywhere
else. It gives you the secrets of appealing to
the fundamental instincts of human nature; it
shows how to present your facts and opinions to
the best advantage; it explains how and when
to arouse the different emotions, etc.
CHARACTER: How to Develop It
Only by intelligent development can the full
force of your character be put into play. This
volume explains the best' methods of develop-
ment. How to make the most of your strong
points and strengthen your weak ones; how to
conquer fear and foolish sentiments; how to see
things clearly and make wise decisions; how to
concentrate; how to develop the reasoning-
powers, the analytical powers, the creative
powers, and co-ordinate them all to work to
your greatest advantage.
Here at last are the laws of the mind so pre-
sented as to be intelligible to all, useful to all
who wish to make their efforts more productive.
Here are the means for knowing yourself as
you really are. Here is the guide to enable you
to make of yourself that which you would be.
These ten handsome, handy and durable
volumes are not a cyclopaedia of the mind or a
series of text-books on psychology. To be sure
the men who compiled them had to understand
psychology; but in them you are enabled to
get the benefit of a profound knowledge of
psychology without going through the drudgery
of making it your life’s study. These books
tell in clear, simple, non-technical language all
that we know about the operation of the human
mind, but their really important function is to
show you how you can apply that knowledge
to your own great interest and profit. For
example: What a tremendous asset is perfect
poise. How priceless it is to the business man,
the host or hostess; yes, even to the burglar.
How few possess it. Yet it is purely a mental
product. Well, volume one of this series
makes a special study of poise because our
authors recognised what a tremendously im-
portant quality it is.
Knowledge is Not Power
Despite an old adage to the effect that it is.
But knowledge may be transformed into power,
and that’s what these hooks will show you how
to do.
Do not confuse MENTAL EFFICIENCY with
study courses or books on so-called “efficiency.”
Their idea of efficiency is teaching a bricklayer
how to lay more bricks, or a stenographer how
to get out more letters, or a machinist how to
make more automobiles. It is good as far as it
goes, but it’s like a railroad that dropped pas-
sengers for ’Frisco in the middle of the Great
American Desert because the rails hadn’t been
laid any further. It’s fine as far as it goes, but
nowadays people are taking through trains.
MENTAL EFFICIENCY, as these books
explain it, is much more than this. It doesn’t
try to teach a bricklayer how to lay more bricks,
but it shows him how to teach himself, so, if he
should quit bricklaying, the knowledge would
still be of use to him. Instead of wasting time
with p, mere result, it goes to the root. What
would be the use of showing a timid person how
to avoid situations in which his timidity was a
handicap, when we can just as easily show him
how to cure his timidity? MENTAL EFFICI-
ENCY does that sort of thing. It is ordinary.
efficiency carried out to its logical conclusion.
The Reason for Success
In these books you see, probably for the first
time, the reasons for success and failure. Why
do some apparently brilliant individuals never
get anywhere, while dull John Brown amasses
millions; or quiet, self-effacing George Smith
achieves a world-wide reputation in letters or
art or medicine or religion? Well, you see and
understand why because the reasons are pre-
sented to you in an intelligible manner. You
do not have to be a philosopher or a psycholo-
gist. You just have to possess common sense
and a healthy curiosity on the subject. Per-
haps John Brown with all his quietness had a
natural force of character and an amount of per-
severance that is given to very few of us. Well
the next thing to having those qualities is learn-
ing how to dermlop them. And teaching you
how to develop them is the big service the
hooks perform.
These Books Show You How to
Win by force of character.
Create opportunities and
make the most of them.

problems of your daily
life.
Organise all your facul-
ties and use them to
your greatest advan-
tage.

United States, whose soil seems to breed
that growth as freely as it does turnips,
swarmed into the older country. They posed
as mediums, links between this world and —
some other. In 18(17 Crookes suffered a
family loss, under painful circumstances, by
the death of his brother Philip. To the
dismay of some, perhaps to the satisfaction
of others, he threw himself, for about five
years, heart and soul into the spiritualistic
movement. He bandaged the eyes of intel-
lect and delivered himself into the hands
of the fakirs of occultism. During these
years he fought desperately to put spiritual-
isjp on a pedestal of demonstrable scientific
fact, even assaulting the citadel of the Royal
Society in the course of his battle. Very
fairly does Dr. Fournier d'Albe put the
whole matter, which, in the public eye,
almost overwhelms legitimate interest in
Crookes’s scientific work. “It may be,” he
remarks, “that future ages will regard
Crookes's incursion into spiritualism as a
temporary aberration, illustrative of nothing
but the fallibility of human judgment. It
may be, on the other hand, that history will
look upon Crookes’s statement of his ‘super-
natural’ observations as one of the major
steps in human evolution.”
Quit of spiritualism and its fever of the
blood, Crookes returned to the serene atmo-
sphere of the laboratory. To chronicle all
that flowmd from his activity taxes even the
diligence of his biographer. There were
among the outstanding results the radio-
meter, the phenomena of “radiant matter,”
the discoveries in high vacua and all that
flowed from the last. The ’seventies saw
the light which shone from Crookes’s vacuum
tubes. Then from across the seas came Edi-
son’s incandescent lamp, a carbon filament
enclosed in a vacuous glass vessel. Upon
its development Crookes bent all his ener-
gies. But other forces were in the field,
and the alluring prospect of capturing an
enormous trade by a successful solution of
the electric-light problem ended, as did so
many of his industrial enterprises, in the
reward passing to the astute men of busi-
ness and finance. In later years came the
discovery, by a German professor, of the
Rontgen rays, made possible by “Crookes’s
tubes.”
To secure this life record. Dr. Fournier
d’Albe has sifted some 40,000 documents,
and if, after the sifting, some chaff may
still be found, it is only there lest by further
•winnowing some aspect of a many-sided
character should escape illumination. His
pages hold the story not only of a great per-
sonality, but of a lovable man, whose life
was simple in its directness and honesty.
He lay, a little child, at Nature’s breast
And drew with reverent lips the pure white truth
With which she fed his soul from earliest youth,
Until she lulled the gray-haired babe to rest.

A Censorship for Children’s Books
Helen is a normal child, rising eight. She
likes Dennis's book of nonsense rhymes better
than anything. Lately her school teacher
set her R. L. Stevenson’s “Child’s Garden
of Verses,” and she informs me she does not
like poetry any longer. To discover the
reason for this sudden aversion I proceeded
for the first time to make a critical examina-
tion of this famous book for children.
I don’t suppose any collection of verses,
except folklore, has run through more edi-
tions or had lavished on it more of the illus-
trator’s and publisher’s art; but a perusal
of it served to confirm a suspicion I had
long entertained that R.L.S. is the most over-
rated writer that ever consciously made him-
self the Mecca of the would-be hadjis of
literature.
The first poem I encountered was called
“Land of Counterpane” :
When I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
And all my toys beside me lay
To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bedclothes through the hills ;
And sometimes set my ships in fleets
All up and down among the 'sheets ;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill
And sees before him dale and plain,
The pleasant • Land of Counterpane.
As a picture of a child at play this is pretty
and would be an ornament to any lady’s jour-
nal ; but as child verse it struck me as
lamentable. Helen likes to have her mind
stimulated by reading about the doings
of giants, tlie bloodier the better, and
I daresay she often becomes the giant,
or, at any rate, the giant-killer, when she
goes to hed ; but this poem left her as cold
as a psycho-analyst’s diagnosis of a dream
caused by an overdose of pink icing.
Then I turned up the following, entitled
“My Bed is a Boat”:
My bed is like a little boat;
Nurse helps me in when I embark ;
She girds me in my sailor’s coat
And starts me in the dark.
At night, I go on board and say
Good-night to all my friends on shore,
I shut my eyes and sail away
And see and hear no more.
And sometimes things to bed I take,
As orudent sailors have to do;
Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
Perhaps a toy or two.
All night across the dark we steer :
But when the day returns at last,
Safe in my room beside the pier,
I find my vessel fast.
This seemed to me as infallibly wrong as
the other. No child ever talked like 'that
about its bed. The living realities which
•the child substitutes for the pale abstractions
with which it is surrounded form the matter
of an intense inner life whose secrets it
never divulges to the adult. It will cer-
tainly think about its bed in much the same
way as R.L.S. has described, but it does
not want to read about it. It does not
analyse the processes of its imagination, and
to see them thus depicted for its edification
must seem to it like profanation, or at best
a typically tiresome specimen of grown-up
garrulity.
Helen’s teacher, who is doubtless a Steven-
son devotee, has carefully marked, for the
child to memorise, all those pieces in which
the blundering mechanism*of the adult mind
creaks most loudly. For instance: —
Children, you are very little,
. And your bones are very brittle.
If you would grow great and stately
You must try to walk sedately.
Or:
It is very nice to think
The world is full of meat and drink,
With little children saying grace
In every Christian kind of place.
It is a forbidding garden R.L.S. invites the
child to walk in. The paths are nicely swept,
but there is a prim look about the flower-
beds, and “Keep Off the Grass” is inscribed
on all the lawns. Here and there Helen has
succeeded in culling a bloom or two, but
for the most part this adult pleasance is
as barren for the child as Wordsworth’s
“Ode on Intimations of Immortality” from
“Recollections of Early Childhood,” wherein
occurs a ponderous picture of a child at play
which is in exactly the same vein as Steven-
son’s, and has as good claim to be called
“children’s verse” except that it is not
“written down” to the child’s intelligence as
Stevenson’s is.
To restore Helen’s pristine appreciation
of poetry I recited to her Meredith’s “Nup-
tials of Attila.” Somewhat to my surprise
the wild barbarity, the fierce rushing music
of it entranced her, and she sat listening
attentively to the end: —
Chirups of the trot afield,
Hurrahs of the battle-charge,
How they answered, how they pealed,
When the morning rose and drew
Bow and javelin, lance and targe,
In the nuptial casement’s view!
Attila, my Attila !
I don’t expect she understood a tenth of it,
but she had been told the story, and she was
borne along on the magnificent rhythm of
the lines to the tragic denouement, like a
chip on Danube’s rushing tide. Then I read
her “The Young Princess,” which she liked
almost equally well. After that she asked
for more, but I had to confess that even
strong men lost themselves in “Woods of
Westermain.”
All this seems to indicate that a censor-
ship for children’s books is badly needed,
to save both the parents’ pockets and the
children’s minds. Parents should sit on
the board, but children should have the cast-
ing vote. The parents have to pay for the
things, but the children have to live with
them and learn them off by heart. The aver-
age parent is in too much of a hurry to
inquire closely into the merits of the so-
called children’s classics offered him by shop-
men at Christmas, and he cheerfully pays
255. for an ornate volume by an approved
author, the intrinsic value of which to the
child is nil. The same thing applies to prose
as to verse, and now that the great ones of
art are beginning to turn their attention to
the illustrating of books for the young, there
is a tendency to an anpalling over-elabora-
tion in the pictures. Helen passes over the
confused gorgeousnesses of Edmund Dulac
with an unseeing eye, but eagerly scans the
simple designs of May Gibbs and Dennis.
Unfortunately for the children, a vast
amount of stuff, both prose and verse, that
is yearly put on the market as suitable for
childish consumption is of the same un-
nourishing quality as these verses of Steven-
son’s. Not that Meredith’s strong meat is
the proper diet for infantile stomachs; but
a poem like the “Nuptials of Attila,” though
written for grown-ups, undoubtedly contains
more of the elements of true children’s verse
than much of the • ornate and highly-priced
literature which is deliberately written for
the purpose by temperamental adults.
M. G. S.
In the Name of Honesty
Mr. Jack Lindsay, in his courteous re-
marks (R.P. 31,/l/’24) about my article on
“Poetry in Australia, 1923,” accuses me of
being actuated by hate. On what he bases
such a supposition it would be very hard to
say. I certainly don’t hate Mr. Jack Lind-
say, as he very well knows ; I certainly don’t
hate Mr. Norman Lindsay, whose work I
very much admire; I certainly don’t hate the
verse in the anthology referred to; and I
certainly don’t hate the preface, which de-
serves to be preserved in some future antho-
logy of Australian humor. The only thing
in connection with the whole matter which
I plainly dislike-—hate is much too strong a
word—is the obvious sham which attempts
to foist something on the reading public for
the thing that it is not.
Mr. Lindsay’s vulgar personal abuse I
leave others to resent. There is a Scotch
proverb which says that you cannot make a
silk purse out of a sow’s ear. I have tried
hard to be courteous to this young man, but
apparently his high mind merely takes that
for weakness. Still, I shall not descend to
his great heights.
The single fragment of argument in all his
noisy torrent of invective is so quaint and
curious that it will amuse a wide circle of
readers. Stripped of its froth and noise, it
amounts merely to a statement that all the
simple, sweet and cleanly things of life are
the mark of the primitive beast, and that
the one thing in poetry is a sexual passion
which does not include any fair or beautiful
thing except in relation to its own appetite.
Smother it in words as he may, this is
exactly what he means. The primitive beast
is any person who can feel an emotion in
any lovely thing apart from an immediate
sex impulse. That will clearly include every
poet who has ever written in any language;
in fact, it will include even Mr. Lindsay
himself.
I wrote neither in the name of “injured
decency” nor in that of “outraged virtue.” I
wrote only in the interests of plain honesty;
and in the name of that honesty I ask what
Mr. Lindsay means by saying: “Could
McKee Wright be stimulated by the golden
body of Titian’s Danae?” Now r , Mr. Lindsay
has never seen that golden body, nor have I.
Therefore to ask the question is the merest
shallow pretence; but in asking it he shows
his exact attitude towards anything like an
honest discussion of any question.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
On Men and Animals
Dean Inge was violently attacked last
year for the following pronouncement:—
It is an unproved assumption that the domination
of the planet by our own species is a desirable thing,
which must give satisfaction to its Creator. There
are many things in the world more divine than man.
And now comes Jack Lindsay with his
“Venus and the Primitive Beast” to help
prove how right the great Anglican divine
was. There are two responses, Mr. Lind-
say points out, to sex. There is the response
of the animal —as simple and natural an affair
as that of an infant caressing its mother,
or vice versa. The animal is to be pitied
“because the expression of Beauty's sensu-
ality will not touch it at all.”- Also there
are men like animals, despicable worms who
have been “tamed, etiolated,” and there is
a means of identifying them: —
The poetry it [the etiolated animal] will favor will
be that in which it talks about abstract virtues,
abstract emotions, and all the little tendernesses,
that give it a feeling of goodwill, generosity and
humanity.
Turn from these unhappy beings to those
who respond to sex along more exalted lines.
The poetry they will favor will be almost
exclusively concerned with seductions, out-
rages and so forth-—rhymed presentments of
such episodes as are to be found in those
Sunday papers which specialise in police-
court reports. They have not only made an
obsession of sex, they have tremendously
complicated it.
Whatever dreams of desire, whatever laughter and
delight in the embrace, have been added to sex by
man, remove it to a happy heaven of beauty which is
the furthest ascint from the animal.
It is recorded that the Marquis de Sade laid
his masterpiece at the feet of Napoleon with a
few explanatory remarks, which were, to all
intents and purposes, identical with those
above quoted. He fully expected the Em-
peror to appreciate his point that the un-
pleasant practices which we now associate
with Sadism were superior in every way to
normal lovemaking. The same lofty, not to
say arrogant, tone was adopted in the nine-
ties of last century by the propagandists of
the Oscar Wilde cult. Napoleon had De
Sade kicked out of France, and his book
burned by the common hangman, and
Wilde’s fate was even more painful.
No moralist I, alas! but my sympathies are
with the tamed and etiolated section of
society as regards the treatment meted out to
these prophets of advanced sexuality. In a
like spirit I am against Puddifoot, who re-
cently achieved, as Lindsay would put it,
“an emotion of loveliness” by slaying a child
in a Sydney suburb. An impartial consid-
eration of these specimens of the human
race, of Jack Lindsay as revealed in his
writings, of many of my friends, and of my-
self fills me with the profoundest admira-
tion for my dog, and for the dog-race in
general. In the matter of sex-response he
and his humble friends are what the Creator
intended us to be. Many of the world’s
greatest men have managed to reject the
temptation to complicate their lives with a
harassing sex pre-occupation, but the weak-
lings—and most of us are weaklings—have
failed, and that fact accounts for three-
fourths of the crime and misery in our
midst to-day.
HENRI SINGEMOINE.
A Satchel of Books
The Blue Lion, by Robert Lynd (Methuen). A
collection of discursive “papers,” pleasant enough,
but undistinguished. Mr. Lynd hasn’t the insinu-
ating manner of the perfect literary gossip.
Janet March, by Floyd Dell (Alfred A. Knopf).
This is an attempt to deal with the life of a girl as
the author did with that of a sensitive, if not sen-
sible, youth in “Moon-Calf” and “The Briary-Bush.
The effort is nothing if it isn’t realistically startling.
Janet, who is rich in illustrious ancestors, is driven
from ’ avoiding promiscuous kisses at dances and
petting-parties to openly courting seduction, and
thence proceeds to abortion and a term of bohemian
life in Greenwich Village, and at the end contem-
plates marrying the man who has been her tnend
for some time.
Under the Southern Cross, by Horace Leaf (Cecil
Palmer). When Conan Doyle returned to England
after his very unimpressive tour of Australia, he
arranged for a well-known “medium” and his wile
to go over the same ground ; and this twelve-and-six-
penny book is the record of the invasion. It is poor
value for the money. Leaf saw very little ot the
country, and appears to have met hardly anybody
except the few who are interested in “psychic phe-
nomena” ; he went to a few places like Jenolan
Caves, and for the purposes of this book they are
Australia. But here and there one gets something
of interest about Leaf’s own specialty, tor instance:
“Mediums are generally condemned on account ot
receiving fees for their service. This is probably
the only profession in the world in which the laborer
is not thought worthy of his hire. Behind this
objection is often the notion that mediumship is a
spontaneous gift calling for no particular effort on
the medium’s part when exercising it. A greater
mistake could not be made. . . .As a rule it requires
years of close application to unfold mediumistic
powers, entailing frequent sittings, alone and in com-
pany, regulation of diet, and several other equally
tedious considerations. . . .1 commenced sitting regu-
larly for psychic development several times
a week when I was 17 years of age,
and continued almost without a break for .15
years. Even now 1 occasionally renew the practice.
This, T think, is fairly typical of the way whicli
most conscientious psychics keep their form.” •It
sounds like prize fighting. Or the horrible things
the average jockey has to go through to keep on
riding at Ost. 101 b.

C. Morrisby on “Breadfruit” Bligh:—
I feel sorry “Rio” (R.P. 3/l/’24) did not give
some further details from the Bligh papers if any
of them refer to the “Bounty” affair. “Rio” is
just in his defence of Bligh as a great navigator and
a brave and resourceful man. The 3600-mile voyage
in that open boat of less than 12 inches freeboard,
without a chart and for half the time with hardly
any provisions, proves that once and for all. But
in the history of the Bounty mutiny and the subse-
quent trial Bligh discloses his worst side, as a
coarse, unjust and vindictive man. In ISB4 Judge
McFarland published a book which condenses very
justly all the accounts of the mutiny and the
trial. It is badly printed and written in a most
exasperating style, but it is the work of a trained
legal mind, and seems only slightly biased against
Bligh when considered in the light of other stories,
such as Bligh’s own and the dull and pious record
by the Rev. T. B. Murray. I recommend it to all
students. The source of the so-called confession by
Christian in the True Briton would be interesting.
When was it made? Who sent it to England?
Who carried it there? The mutiny took place on
April 28, 1789, and it is pretty certain that, although
Christian felt deep remorse for his crime, he would
never have spoken of Bligh in the terms of his
confession. It was not till September 23 that
Christian took final leave of those members of the
crew who preferred to wait at Tahiti for a man-of-
war, rather than sail away with him; and there is
no record of his forwarding any communication to
England. After that date the probability is he
was never seen again. So that the publication of a
confession seven years afterwards needs some explain-
ing. Finally, Hayward was not a mutineer, and cer-
tainly not a leader. He was a midshipman who
accompanied Bligh in the open boat.

A test was recently conducted, under the
auspices of several motor publications, to
demonstrate to the South African public
the utility and economy of motor transpor-
tation for long distances. The sturdy
Chevrolet, shown in the upper picture,
covered the thousand miles of roadless
veldt between Capetown and Pretoria, beat-
ing the mail train by four hours and the
best previous motor car record by fourteen
hours. The lower picture shows the new

Chevrolet—
the first quality motor car
within the reach of millions
MILLIONS of people have awaited the com-
ing of a quality car which would be within
their means.
This car they find in Chevrolet. Beautiful,
sturdy, powerful, the Chevrolet is a complete
motor car; and it covers the longest distances
with a minimum consumption of fuel and oil.
More than 1,000,000 Chevrolets have been sold, and
nearly 500,000 more will be produced this season. For
Chevrolets, built for economical transportation, are used
the world over by business men, professional men,farmers,
women —everyone who is handicapped by time or distance.
Chevrolet is adding to the enjoyment of living and is
helping to make each nation a neighborhood.
3* # ♦ *
The Chevrolet Motor Company can make this quality
car at a low price because it is a division of General
Motors, the largest automotive organization in the world.
By uniting the strength of all its members, General
Motors gives to each the economies of quantity produc-
tion and a wealth of engineering talent which no single
company could command.

Royal Cord Tyres Are
Now Made by Three
New Processes Which
Haye Revolutionized
Tyre Making
THE development by the United States Rubber Company of
three remarkable new processes of rubber manufacture now
gives to Royal Cord Tyres a quality never before reached by
any tyre.
1. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective that
a virgin rubber ol a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
2. The New Web Cord. Of Specific application to the art
of cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other

3. The New Flat-Band Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and at
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
of the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries, fully protected by patents in the
U. S. A. and other countries, are the exclusive property of the
United States Rubber Company, makers of Royal Cord Tyres.
Obtainable at all Garages.

Simply by allowing electricity to do the work.
The ‘ 'Hurley Superior” Clothes Washer will wash your most delicate
fabrics without injury. Just as you do now, by gently dipping them in
a bowl of sudsy water, with never a rub. Just this way does the ‘‘Hurley
Superior” wash clothes.
It is so constructed and the operation is such that the clothes fall of their
own weight into the foamy suds. In this way the soapy water is forced
through the fabric, removing all the dirt and grease without the slightest wear.
No matter how delicate, no matter how rough, the “Hurley Superior”
will thoroughly cleanse every fabric —perfectly.
The “Hurley Superior” not only washes everything (from a handkerchief
to the heaviest bedspread) with no wear whatever, but it wrings them too!
The payment of a small sum down and the easy monthly plan will place
you in possession of the “Hurley Superior” to perform this arduous drudgery.

Through Flowers.
They said “Her spirit is with God.”
I looked to where she lay
And seemed to find a soul asleep
Within its bed of clay.
Winter was yellow on the hills,
But when the springtide green
Came stealthily by weald and wold
And on her grave was seen
The primal shaping of the leaf
I guessed a stirring there —
A moth-soul, seeking wings to try
The lofty heights of air;
A quivering thing, impatient for
The warmer, blossomy hours....
The only way her soul could climb
Was upward through the flowers!

Imprisoned.
To strive and strive, and count the goal
attained;
To fall and struggle up again through hell;
To spurn a million demons and to quell
Their voices, which, like arrows, poison-
stained.
Bite deep and fester long; to stand arraigned
Before a heart which, loving, can rebel
(Oh misery no human speech could tell!)
Before a rebel mind, love-dazed and drained!
From this there is no flight, no rest. The
years
Show endless climbings out of black despair
To reach the mountain peaks that blaze
above.
They show achievement and they show the
tears
That follow ; for no peace can linger where
The ill is loving, and the cure is Love.

From the Beach.
His features bronzed by sun and wind.
His hands made rough by work,
He stands upon the ocean beach,
A man from Back o’ Bourke.
Green breakers bursting in white foam,
Sea-spaces wild and wide
That stretch beyond his utmost ken,
He gazes on wide-eyed.
He feels the spell that falls on all
Who first behold the sea;
Born inland, inland-reared, he sees
What seems infinity.
No saltbush grows upon that plain
Ablaze in noontide heat,
No grey gums blur its distant rim
Where sky and ocean meet.
He knows the tracks, the roads, the routes,
The dusty, barren ways
That stretch their miles, where western
noons
Weird mirage-shapes upraise.
There teamsters trudge beside their teams,
And camels bear their loads;
But here before him shining lie
Unknown, untravclled roads.
Unmade by man, far east they go,
O’er slopes that rise and fall,
And rise and fall for evermore
Ungrooved, unrutted all.
Southward a liner, takes her way—
Foam marks her fleeting wake- —
And many ships before him speed,
And many roads they take.
Anon, when under western stars
He slumbers tranquilly,
He’ll dream and see in dreams again
The many-roaded sea.

THIRD PARTIES.
General elections are to be held shortly in
two States where Liberals or Nationalists
are in office, South Aus. and Westralia. The
tide is running so steadily against the
Nationalists or Liberals (the difference is
only in name) that neither Government is
feeling comfortable. On the surface Mit-
chell's position is stronger than when he
went to the country in 1921. Then he led
the weakest of the three parties into which
the Westralian Parliament was divided ; now
a majority of the retiring Assemblymen are
pledged to sink or swim with him. But
the gain is more apparent than real. In
the first place, Mitchell has lost the sup-
port of the P.P.A. executive, the power be-
hind the Country party, the agreement with
that party, by virtue of which he obtained
office in 1919 and held it throughout the late
Parliament, having been denounced. Cer-
tainly the three Cocky Ministers and twelve
of the rank and file are supporting the Gov-
ernment in defiance of the Primary Pro-
ducers’ executive; but one Minister (Scad-
pan) and one private member are not up
for re-election, and most of the others will
probably lose their seats. They have
advanced the claim that theirs is “the Minis-
terial Country party” ; but, having no organ-
isation, and being committed to Mitchell,
they are indistinguishable from Nationalists,
and, apart from the Premier, who commands
a strong personal vote in Northam, the West-
ralian Cockics have had no use for National-
ists since 1917. Practically all the P.P.A.
branches have passed votes of confidence in
the executive. Again, matters are shaping
badly for some of the National Labor mem-
bers, who have supported non-Labor Govern-
ments since the conscription split. The
Labor Opposition, which has a leader of
ability in Philip Collier, counts on regain-
ing at least three of the five seats possessed
by the N. Lab. group, and expects to wrest a
couple more from the Nationalists and one
( Scaddan’s) from a Ministerial Cocky. It
may not be returned with a majority over all
other factions—that would necessitate a gain
of eight seats—but it is almost certain to
be stronger than the Mitchell party. In
which case it may take office in the fashion
of Ramsay Macdonald.
* * * *
Harwell's prospects are no brighter than
those of the. Groperland Premier. Three
years ago the impulsive man from Stanley was
victorious over the direct Labor Opposition
and the Labor conscriptionists, who called
themselves. Nationalists. On this occasion
he is fighting Labor, led by the same John
Gunn, and Mclntosh's Country party, and
he will find that the Cockies are made of
more durable stuff than the Labor conscrip-
tionists, who were easily annihilated. Un-
like Mitchell, who has the virtue of tolera-
tion, Barwell went out of his way to anta-
gonise the Agrarians. He refuses to allow
that they have any right to be on the poli-
tical map. At Waikerie on January 11 he
said that if one of the C.P. members was
his own brother he would advise the electors
to vote against him. For this Barwellian
reason: ‘‘the return of any Country party
member not only weakens the position of
Liberals, but strengthens the position of
Labor. ’ The obvious reply to this is that
nine of the 14 C.P. seats in the House of
Reps, used to be Labor seats, and if there
were no Country party would probably re-
turn to Labor. Certainly the Country
party derives . a lot of its strength from
farmers who invariably voted Labor when
restricted to a choice between Labor and
Liberal; but the S.A. Premier refuses it
even that merit. To him the Cockies have
nowhere justified their existence, every-
where caused political trouble and instability
and proved a drag-chain on the wheels of
progress. ’ In that faith he refused even to
pass a preferential voting measure lest a
Cocky might beat the Liberal on the first
count and win on second preferences. He
now asserts that preferential voting, with
single electorates, is part of the Liberal
policy, and that “if it had been possible
to give effect to that plank in the last Par-
liament it would have been done.” Consider-
ing that the Government had ample majori-
ties in both Houses and lots of time, this is
too thin.
In the bitterness of his discovery that
thousands of former S.A. Libs, are going
to vote against him, Barwell sighs for the
return of the days when there were only
two parties:—
What is. most necessary in times like these? Poli-
tical stability. Does the three-party system make
tor that? Clearly it does not. In only two States
ot the Commonwealth is there what is known as
stable government—gov eminent by an absolute majo-
i v. ese .‘"'tates are South Australia and Queens-
land. Experience of the three-party system in other
parts of Australia aid in other parts of the world
should be a sufficient warning to the electors.
Political stability is desirable, as an aid to
good government. But Australia has known
cases where it coincided with bad govern-
ment. Queensland, for instance, has had
more political stability in the present cen-
tury than any other part of Australia; the
same crowd has been in office —always with
an absolute majority, and since 1922 with-
out the. brake of a second chamber —for
nearly nine years. Yet, thanks to the stable
Government, the railways, once highly profit-
able, have become chronically bankrupt, and
the country has been reduced to the most
desperate financial straits any Australian
State has known. On the otlier hand, the
country has never been more ably ruled than
during the first and most fruitful decade of
the Commonwealth Parliament, and for
nearly the whole of that period there were
three parties in the House of Reps. In short,
stable Governments are apt to become stodgy
or reactionary or worse, whereas unstable
Governments (the uncertainty of their posi-
tion calling forth all their talents) some-
times excel. Again, young third parties, like
Labor in Britain and the Cockies in Aus-
tralia, are not to be condemned merely be-
cause they are a nuisance to tactless Pre-
miers (one. of whom talks as if Nature
fashioned in him the perfect statesman
and then broke the mould), or even because
they are prone to exact concessions when
they hold the balance of power. Broadly
considered, they are natural and healthy out-
lets for popular discontent. In Britain, with
1,250.000 unemployed, mostly ex-service men,
the. Labor party, whatever may be said
against its policy, is certainly a safeguard
against revolution. Yet, according to Bar-
well’s notions, it has no right to exist, since
Britain already had two old parties, the
higs and the Tories, and “stability” is
the only thing that matters. There would
be precious little political progress, and any
amount of civil discord, if the Barwellian
theories found universal acceptance. At all
events, British Labor and the' Australian
Cockies have got to bp one of three parties
before they can becofne one of two. Bar-
well looks forward gloomily to the advent
of a Labor Government kept in office by the
Farmers. But the latter may elect to work
in with Liberals more .congenial than the
S.A. Premier, or Mitchell in Westralia, or
they may be willing to try an expedient
which, after all. is the logical outcome of the
situation in five of the seven Australian
Parliaments : an elective Ministry.
A PLEA FOR HONEST THINKING.
Moke than half the troubles of the human
race arise from Man’s infinite capacity for
pulling his own leg. During the late war
self-deception was raised to the status of a
patriotic duty, and only persons of the
utmost eminence or power—a (J. B. Shaw
or a Northcliffe —were allowed to tell the
truth. Some popular fictions were that our
enemies were cowards who had to be flogged
into action ; that our Allies were saints as
well as supermen and the. Empire’s blood-
brethren for afl time; that a new era was
dawning, in which everyone would be pros-
perous and happy (more especially the sol-
diers in the trenches and their dependants),
and that in order to bring this state of
affairs to pass we merely had to listen to our
far-sighted statesmen and follow their advice.
A different set of fictions is being insisted on
to-day. Then we were organised for an un-
natural display of hate and suspicion, so that
the Tommies, who, in the misery of the
front line on a certain Christmas
Eve, accepted the invitation of the Ger-
mans to join in a hymn, were warned by
G.H.Q. that a repetition of such conduct
would earn them a court-martial sentence.
Now we are organised for an equally unreal
manifestation of world-friendliness and
trust. No one with the capacity for inde-
pendent thought believes that the world of
1924 is any less greedy or tigerish than it
proved itself to be between 1914 and 1918,
and no intelligent person who stops to think
is deceived by the assurances of goodwill
that are being exchanged amongst practi-
cally all the nations except France and Ger-
many. All these protestations mean is that
the pacifist dreamers and schemers have
temporarily displaced the militarist schem-
ers and dreamers. A peace-time morale is
being created on war-time lines. If any-
thing, this manifestation is more perilous
than its predecessor. There was some truth,
anyhow, in the propaganda about the bestial-
ity and predatoriness of the Boche; there
is absolutely none in the pacifist-inter-
nationalist theory concerning the readiness
of virile races, with less than they think
they deserve, to be reasoned into a contented
frame of mind by weak nations with great
possessions which they aye incapable of
defending.
* * * *
The English Ghubch Times, which
throughout the war was uncompromising in
its militarism, voiced the newer humbug
last- week in an article which condemned
political materialists of the Lord Birken-
head type— : “one who in his rectorial address
at the Glasgow University sneered at the
ideals which are the very soul of the Chris-
tian religion”—and supported the Mac-
donald Ministry on the ground that “the
need for Christianity in high places was
never more vital than to-day.” Christianity
in high places is like disarmament: it would
be a great thing for the world if everybody
went in for it. Actually our potential com-
petitors in trade and industry in Asia are
non-Christian, while the Russian Govern-
ment is working to overthrow Christianity.
The mainsprings of the Redeemer’s teach-
ings are love and tolerance; and where are
those qualities in. the nations? Even the
esteem in which we held our Allies has been
replaced in some cases by a growing dis-
trust and dislike; and several new sources
of trouble have appeared. The British
masses are not nearly so patient in the
presence of wealth as they used to be. Un-
employment, the flaunting of war fortunes,
an appreciation of the insincerity of those
who once talked about “a world made fit
for heroes”—these and other factors are
causing the discontent that has been normal
in Freetrade England since the rest of the
world went in for Protection to be leavened
generously with talk of revolution. It is
at this crisis that a number of amiable
theorists want the world handed over to
the control of men whose political creed
assumes that the world at large is ready
to practise peace and goodwill!
This is an age of leagues, social, political
and international, and nearly all of them,
from the League of Nations down to the
curious little Yankee organisation dedicated
to the abolition of Sabbath strolling, are ex-
travagantly idealistic. A League for the
Facing of Facts is badly needed for the
peace and good government of the world.
The disaster of 1914 was precipitated by
the assumption on the part of British Liberal-
ism that Pan-Germanism was a bogey set
up by adventurers who wanted to commit
the United Kingdom to compulsory military
service. The Correct response to Germany’s
growing army and navy, said the present
Lord Chancellor a year before the Serajevo
affair, was an efficient little volunteer armv,
a; diminished fleet, and a stream of assur-
ances that England had; perfect faith in the
pacific intentions of f Berlin. If Lord
Rorerts’s advice had been followed, as re-
gards a modified form of conscription, and if
a plain-spoken man of the world of the
Birkenhead type had held Mr. Asquith’s
position, it is almost certain that Germany
would _ have climbed down. She fought,
according to authoritative disclosures made
since the Armistice, because she had been led
to believe Britain would not fight, just as
she included neutral vessels in her submarine
campaigns on the assumption, fostered by
America’s Heakst press, that the U.S.A.
cither would not or could not send soldiers
to Europe. The same fallacies that led
to war in Europe are being promulgated in
the world’s new storm-centre, which, unfor-
tunately for Australia, is the Pacific. We
are asked to believe that no Asiatic Power
looks on what we have and wants it badly
enough to take it if we are not disposed to
defend it; that our sea-borne trade is not
worth an insurance premium in the form of
a base at Singapore; that soft-soap is an
i effective substitute for battleships. There
is a great temptation on the part of politi-
cians to exploit this cant: most people prefer
to say the estimable thing, and there is
nothing more estimable, in the average white
community, than to uphold the principles of
Christianity, while the advocate of world-
brotherhood is always certain of having with
him those who shirk giving their country
either personal or financial service. Yet in
practice any present attempt at a logical
anplication to world affairs of what are
alleged to be Christian principles would be
fatal m the long run—as fatal as if a nation
took the management of its affairs out of the
hands of a Poincare and handed them over
to a conscientious curate. Such is the un-
pleasant truth, and it is the worst form of
national atheism to deny it.
THE DOG AND THE DAW.
Patient research in the records of Austra-
lian history may be able, to fix the date
when the dog arrived. His legal friend the
goat, with whom, for some occult reason, lie
is coupled in legislation, has his increase in
the early days of settlement carefully re-
corded. Not so the dog. He and his family
came, remained and multiplied, unlionored
and unsung, so far as the statistician was
concerned. But haying regard to his habits,
the hand of Authority must have reached out
for him quite early in his career—all the
Common Law of England applied to him, so far
as it was referable to his kind. Yet the
dog has a fine classic reputation, and had
one of the early Governors constituted him
a censor of morals he might have done use-
ful if not popular service. If anyone reads
Addison nowadays he will find in the Spec-
tator the following passage: “It is well
known by the learned that there was a temple
upon Mount Etna dedicated to Vulcan which
vvas guarded by dogs of so exquisite a smell
(say the historians) that they could dis-
cern whether the persons who came thither
were chaste or otherwise.” Possibly a ken-
nel of them might still do good service here
and there.
As far back as 1835 the statute dog-law
of Australia began. The masterless hound
has been the pathetic subject of the brush
and the muse so far as “the memory of
man runneth not to the contrarv” ; but the
prosaic truth is that the brute has an atavis-
tic prompting to vagrancy. It was found
necessary to provide, among other things
that he should “be taken to be kept by
the person who shall be in the actual occu-
pation of the house or premises upon which
he shall be found, unless reasonable
proof to the contrary shall be adduced.”
it will be noticed that, after the
manner of lawgiving, the real difficulty,
what constitutes “reasonable proof,” is left
unsolved; and the proofs sometimes offered
by defendants are weird and wonderful. “I
found the dog on the premises,” says the
constable; and the Clerk of Petty Sessions
has no record of his registration. The de-
fendant, of course, denies all knowledge of
the brute. He is, it is always so, a stray
dog, and food has been given to him as an
act of charity. There seems, in the annals
of the police court, to be a wider-spread com-
passion for stray dogs than for strav
humans.
But he does not always come into court
with so indifferent a character. He has
even been brought within the category of
competent witnesses.” Some seven years ago
Judge Backhouse, then of the N. S. Wales
Bench, but now enjoying a well-earned rest
from his judicial labors, had before him an
appeal from a stipendiary liiagistrate’s order
with regard to the alleged detention of a
certain dog. Many witnesses were called
on both sides as to the identity of the ani-
mal, with the result that the testimony was
so equally balanced the Judge admitted he
had difficulty in coming to a decision. So
he called for the dog. The witness was
brought into _ court. “Now, you call the
do«v’ said his Honor to the appellant.
Trixie, Trixie,” and then still more
sweetly, “T-r-i-x-i-e,” said he; but he might
as well have whistled to the wind. The
terrier gave no response. Meantime the
little creature, who had the free run of the
court, went excitedly round, yapping and
sniffing. “Now, you call the dog,” said his
Honor to the respondent. “There’s no need,”
he replied; “she’ll find me soon,” and she
did. . The terrier marked him as he spoke,
and a moment was wildly pawing at her
master’s legs. That appeal was dismissed —
with costs.
The owner of any dog is liable in damages
for injury committed by the dog without
Proof of scienter or neglect. That is to say,
complainant need not show that the
dog’s misconduct was due to his master’s
negligence, or that he well knew his mis-
chievous propensities. His dog. his peril-
such is dog law.
But all this time the dweller in the
suburbs has been asking; “Is there any
provision in law to meet the intolerable mid-
night barking of Jones’s dog?” This
barking of Jones’s dog by night is a very
ancient complaint. David declared of his
enemies: “They return at evening; they
make a noise like a dog, and go round about
the city.” Apparently he knew Jones’s
hound. Yet the dog, we are told, is not by
nature a barker. At one time a number of
dogs were marooned on that island of
romance, Robinson Crusoe’s isolated home.
When, after years of absence from man,
they were recovered, there was not a bark
among the lot of them. Apparently it is
an acquired habit, and a bad one at that.
Statute law provides no remedy for these
suburban sufferings ; but possibly—and pos-
sibly only—if the bark came to you and not
you to the bark, that delightfully vague
word “nuisance” might cover it. Better,
however, to agitate for a Local Government
ordinance, for such ordinances are capable
of covering the earth and all that therein is.
Unless a dog is licensed he is in most,
if not all, the States, an outlaw, and has no
social or other standing. If such a dog is
found at large, and, on due notice given, is
not claimed by some master, he may be
killed. The usual provision of law is that
all dogs kept within the boundaries of any
city, town or police district must be regis-
tered. This, however, does not apply to
pups less than six months old. The un-
fortunate registrar of dogs is, as a rule,
the Clerk of Petty Sessions, on whose luck-
less shoulders are piled all the odd jobs of
legislation, this among the many. At that
time of the year when the earth begins to
show the promise of Spring the soul of the
C.P.S. reaches out to dogs. His days be-
come chequered with assorted dogs, dogs of
all breeds and of no breed, in every color
knpwn to doggery.
When business is slack and for the time
being there are no statistics to be collected
or electors to be enrolled, the police turn
their attention to unregistered dogs. The
niinimum N. S. Wales fine has crystallised
into what may be called a standard. It is
ten shillings, with costs of court. Not a
large sum to the average citizen, but occa-
sionally it presses on the very poor, for
after the fine is paid the dog has still to
be registered. The N. 8. Wales law pro-
vides, moreover, that dogs, whether regis-
tered or unregistered, found at large in any
part of any city, town or police district
without being under the immediate custody,
protection or control of some competent per-
son, and not having a collar with his mas-
ter’s name on him, may be killed and de-
stroyed. A constable who does not use “his
best endeavor” in this respect is liable to
a penalty. His reward is a half-crown per
dog's tail, and the price has not risen with
the cost of living. Before claiming his


reward the constable has to carry out certain
mortuary rites in the presence of the police
magistrate. On his visiting day, and dur-
ing the luncheon adjournment, if no other
time can be found for the burnt offering,
the sergeant advises him that the funeral pyre
has been prepared in a convenient place,
remote from the public eye. Thus saitli
the law: “Provided that in every case in
which a reward is claimed for the destruc-
tion of any dog, the party applying for such
reward.... shall produce the tail of such
dog, which shall be immediately burned or
otherwise destroyed in the presence of the
police magistrate.” They reach the selected
spot, where the lockup-keeper has prepared a
little pile of leaves, twigs and small wood.
“Better get round here, your Worship, to
the leeward,” remarks the sergeant as the
P.M. produces his pocket-handkerchief. A
young constable appears bearing six assorted
dogs’ tails. These he arranges carefully in
a pyramid on the pyre. The number is
tallied off, and then a match is put to the
odorous mound. The wind is capricious,
and there is no determinate leeward. The
P.M. chokes into his handkerchief. “Ser-
geant, I’ll certify—come along” ; and they
beat a hasty retreat to the court-house, leav-
ing to the young constable the virtuous satis-
faction of having earned six half-crowns .by
the sacrifice of the six offensive tails that
smell to Heaven.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Woodrow Wilson.
“He is the greatest figure since Christ,”
proclaimed an English writer when U.S.
President Woodrow Wilson published his
“Fourteen Points,” and America and the
Allied nations took up the cry. He was a
redeemer in a very real sense; but the last
thing the world wanted of him was what
he desired to give it. We know now, from
ex-Ambassador Page’s memoirs, that the sub-
marine campaign was beating Britain when
the U.S. came in. France was failing in
man-power, and Italy in morale, and
America had realised that if Germany won
it would be her turn next. So the whole of
Wilson’s ideals —many of them, such as
“self-determination” and “universal peace,”
wildly conflicting—were swallowed, and the
Germans were beaten. The process of dis-
illusionment began at once, at home as well
as abroad. In the first flush of patriotic
excitement Big Business had acclaimed the
President’s pronouncement that “tlie man
who made a fortune out of the war was a
man disgraced.” The time was soon to come
when the whole American nation was to
figure as a war-profiteer insisting on the last
cent of its dues. At the Peace Conference
the man who on his former visit to Europe
had been treated like a god found himself
talked down, ignored, even derided. The
time for hifalutin, he was told in effect by
the implacable Clemenceau, was over: they
had now to deal logically with the prac-
ticalities of life. Wilson went home beaten
and with his faith in human nature shat-
tered. He found himself no more a prophet
in his own country than in Europe. America
saw him now as the type of unbalanced
visionary who imagines that what men pro-
mise in an extremity of terror they are bound
to adhere to when the danger is past; that
the Devil is the same in sickness and in
health. He fought hard for American parti-
cipation in European affairs, but his defeat
was a foregone conclusion long before the
breakdown, during his Middle West cam-
paign. which ended his career. He died “de-
spised and rejected of men” —of the sort of
men, anyhow, whose esteem is of value to
party politicians. But in another sense his
name will live. His place is among the
saintly little band of missioners who in all
the ages have been ahead of their time.

Australasia Facing the Storm.
Nothing seems less likely than that the
Singapore-base scheme will be gone on with
by the present British Government, though
arguments pro and con. are likely to rage for
some time to come. It is not a question of
violating the 'Washington Agreement, all the
parties to which knew of the Admiralty’s
desire for a dock at Singapore, yet refrained
from ruling out the project in their treaty.
Labor jibs at the initial cost, which at the
lowest estimate will be over £10,000,000,
and even more at the prospect of having to
garrison the port (a minimum of 10,000
white troops will be required) and out-
class the Japanese fleet in Asiatic waters.
There is another factor —never mentioned in
official circles, but ever present in the minds
of the rank and file—and London’s Daily
Herald put it bluntly the other day:—
Each portion of the Empire is responsible for
its local defence. Singapore and defence against
Japan are responsibilities for Australia and Maori-
land, and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald must therefore
abandon the folly of Singapore.
The reasoning is perfectly sound. Last
year Britain spent 265. Bd. per head on the
Navy against Australia’s Bs. Id. and Maori-
land’s 4s. 7d. One of the effects of the
assumption of this burden by the British
taxpayers was to safeguard the trade route
of the Indian Ocean, along which over 75
per cent, of the imports and exports of Aus-
tralia travel. The United Kingdom could
struggle along without any of the goods we
export, but without some of those we im-
port from Britain the Commonwealth would
be in the plight of one marooned in an
unarmed state on an island peopled by
not very friendly natives. Our national
life depends_ at present on the holding of a
sea line which, if unpoliced by a dominant
Empire navy based on that line’s eastern
flank, might be breached by a single coin-
merce raider—and it is worth noting in
this connection that Japan’s revised ship-
building programme, to start this year, pro-
Aides for twenty-four 1500-ton cruisers which
are commerce-raiders or nothing The aban-
donment of the Singapore Dock project
must therefore mean a complete reversal of
our defence outlook and policy. We will
have to be prepared, in the event of trouble,
to let the British trade-connection go. In
other words, we will have to make up our
minds to create national arsenals here,
capable of providing those requirements of
modern warfare which we have hitherto
brought from Woolwich and Birmingham.
It will no longer be possible for us to dream
of an offensive-defensive undertaken at a
point thousands of miles from our coastal
cities. We will have to wait for the enemy
and engage him with submarines and fast
mine-laying and anti-submarine surface
craft. The expense will be immeasurably
greater than if we had been given tlie
chance to contribute ships and men to an
Empire fleet on an overseas trade basis, as
outlined in the Jellicoe report. Never-
theless there are compensations. The right
sort of young man is often benefited by being
suddenly thrown on his own resources, after
a life of ease and luxury, and the same rule
applies in the case of the right sort of young
nation.

About Ramsay Macdonald’s Finances.
“Solomon Malaprop” has a look at them
from the roof of the synagogue:—
Great Britain has shelved, for the time being,
the only party which had a definite scheme for
putting things right, though that party remains
the largest of the tnree; but there is no reason to
believe that its policy is shelved. If Britain pos-
sessed the referendum in the sense that Switzerland
has it, and the sense in which all the Australian
States haven’t it, the tariff issue could be put to
the people separately, and then Ramsay Macdonald’s
crowd would have to state its beliefs, without the
“levy on capital” fad blocking the way. It is
amazing how much Labor leaders want the refer-
endum in a general way, so that large matters of
dispute like McTiernan’s Profiteering Bill, and
Lang’s Land Confiscation Bill, and Theodore’s
Pastoral Rents Bill, to say nothing of the Can-
berra capital, may be voted on definitely and directly.
And it is amazing how they don’t get any complete
and workable referendum, even when they are in
power.
One reason why the Baldwin Ministry held that
something unusual was due was to be found in the
bankruptcy returns. During tlie war matters were
not bad, and for a short time after the war they
were good. But later the competition of countries
with cheap labor and cheap currencies, and coun-
tries which were economising by not paying principal
or interest of their debts, began to produce curious
results. These are some figures for England and
Wales:—
Eight Years’ Bankruptcy.
Liabilities. Shortage.
1915.. £5,795,575 £3,662,718
1916.. 4,197,008 2,440,015
1917.. 2,959,676 1,209,404
1918.. 1,321,355 263,476
1919.. 2,373,798 1,424,107
1920.. 6,853,308 3,804,315
1921.. 21,887,373 12,989,120
1922 . . 24,918,995 17,415,909
In fact, the country was filing its schedule whole-
sale and retail, and probably the progress reports
for 1923, which Baldwin had before him, showed
that the old regime was going to the Devil faster
and faster. Taking the latest figures in eacli coun-
try, and judging by the aggregate deficit in insol-
vent estates, England and Wales became, in pro-
portion to population, almost nine times more
addicted to the bankruptcy habit than the Common-
wealth was. That was something to think about.
In 1923 the British shipyards launched 30 pel
cent, less tonnage of new ships than in any: peace year
since 1892. And the unemployment trouble grew so
bad that, in addition to the £40,000,000 or so per
annum paid under the unemployment insurance
seneme, a programme for the spending of another
£50,000,000 on relief works during 1924 was out-
lined. One visible reason was that imports exceeded
exports in the course of three years by
£830,000,000. The difference is a great deal to
pay for, seeing that the Old Man in London is now
paying interest also to the United States, and that
he has lent nearly £1,900,000,000 to Allies who
seem to be unanimously bad marks. Also it is an
awful amount of work to give away when British
factories have so little work.
An unprecedented situation having arisen, partly
because cheap laborers, virulent enemies and chronic
bad-debtors like Germany and Russia had resumed
competition in the free British market, the Baldwin
Government proposed a resort to the commonest
of all expedients. It proposed to keep out the
people who wanted to invade the country with
goods, just as it might keep out people who wanted
to invade it with troops. There was no suggestion
of doing anything which couldn’t be undone inside
a month if the experiment failed to give satisfaction.
Nobody had any idea of burning down Heaven or
declaring war against the universe. The horror of
the old Freetrade push was a carefully staged mock-
ery, unless it is a fact that “shoddy doth make
cowards of us all.”
This was the situation which Ramsay Macdonald
seized with both hands.
The Ramsay Macdonald party, like the Asquith-
George party, proposes to let the foreigner still
supersede the British worker in his own market.
In fact, it proposes to go a little further than
Asqpith-George, for it wants to bestow kindness
and encouragement on Russia and Germany, two
cheap-labor countries which are able to be cheap
partly because they positively refuse to pay Britain
and its Allies any of the money they owe.
Its one great financial inspiration is the levy on
capital, and if this doesn’t come off—and Ramsay
Macdonald says he doesn’t intend that it shall —
then the Ramsay Macdonald Government is in
office under false pretences.
As the plan was outlined, the capital levy was to
be on a sliding scale, and the man with something
over a million was to be asked for a cheque for
half his possessions. He pays the heaviest income-
tax, super-tax and death duties, and he was also to
pay the heaviest levy. Whitaker’s Almanac for
1923 figured out his case. It reckoned that a man
with a business yielding £77,000 a year is gener-
ally considered worth £1,100,000. Being one of
those who are taxed on the big scale, his income-
tax and super-tax are 11s. 3d. in the £l, and
take over £43,300. Then there is a very heavy
levy on capital (death duties of various kinds) to
be provided for at the owner’s death. Estate duty
absorbs 30 per cent, and succession duty anything
up to another 10 per cent, of the kind of fortune
under consideration, and if, say, three owners cf
the fortune die in quick succession, there is not v
great deal of it left. This levy is quite as sure as the
one which Ramsay talked of before the election; but
as the nation doesn’t die simultaneously, it doesn’t
come in one fatal heap.
It is reckoned that the three items, income-tax,
super-tax and provision for death-taxes, leave the
nominal owner of £77,000 a year about £20,000
a year to pay board and lodging and sundries with.
Probably a sudden demand for £550,000 might up-
set both his mental and financial equilibrium. If he
sawed off half the business and gave it to Ramsay
Macdonald he would at least save a lot of taxation,
and his estate would save a lot of the prospective
death levy, and Macdonald would lose heavily on
both counts. But, then, one can’t eat his bullock
and drive it in the waggon at the same time.
Anyhow, I would give all the subscription I in-
tended for the church to see Ramsay frae Lossie-
mouth make a whole-hearted attempt at his levy.
But I think the church is quite safe.
The John Bull Building Society,
Almost Unlimited.
The British Government started big and
robust finance early, and Australia looks
on anxiously, for it has £105,000,000 of old
debt to renew in London during tlie next
five years, and there are six Treasurers who
would gladly borrow an equal amount of
new money, or more if available. If John
Bull begins to use up all the resources of
his market himself there will arise a
feeling of injury, the same as if he had basely
eloped with his own wife when someone else
had an eye on the lady. At the first meet-
ing of the new Cabinet the housing problem
was discussed, and later the Minister of
Health told the press that he proposed to
take off his coat and any other superfluous
attire, and get to work at building 250,000
new homes annually. The State had built
100,000 houses and subsidised the building of
30,000 more by 1922, and it has added per-
haps 100,000 since, but the proposed pace
breaks all past records. At first the State’s
pattern house was put up for about £1000;
but the figure dropped, through the slump in
materials and many other causes, till it
reached about £4OO. Then the department
had to reduce rents, and regard the differ-
ence as a bad debt. Though loss was inevi-
table in the very nature of things, it
shouldn’t have been such a loss; but Lloyd
George possessed the fatal gift of his coun-
tryman Hughes for making a shilling do
the work of sixpence. Furthermore, he
acquired in the war-time a masterful habit
of paying almost any price (in loan money)
for speed, and he carried this breezy method
into peace days when velocity was sometimes
not worth buying at the figure. The house-
subsidy policy was a supplementary method
by which the private builder who conformed
to certain conditions as to quality and rent
was to receive a gift of £l2O per house (£0
per annum for 20 years) ; in other words,
the State paid for a fixed amount of slump,
and no more. So in addition to other out-
lays the Treasury has a fine lot of house-
pensions on its hands. If the price of the
pattern home remains at £4OO the enlarged
scheme will cost £100,000,000 yearly; and
if the new Treasurer is as regardless as the
old Welsh one was, it is likely that the
price of loan money will rise in a manner
depressing to six anxious Australian Pre-
miers and an agitated Australian Prime
Minister. Certainly the appearance of
Britain as a large, steady borrower on its
own market in peace-time is bound to have
an upsetting effect. And the position here,
as regards the States especially, doesn’t
show that they have been preparing for any
extra strain. They all have sinking funds,
it is true; but they all have accumulated
deficits also, and the Federal figure man has
supplied details up to June, 1922 : —-
Six Sinking Six Accumulated
Funds. ' Shortages.
1918 .. £11,033,324 £6,578,103
1919 . . 11,669,712 6,707,359
1920 . . 12,169,108 9,091,516
1921 . . 13,261,720 10,459,946
1922 . . 14,147,206 12,807,925
It is a poor sort of a balance-sheet to take
round on renewal day (which is going to be
every day for a good while now), especially
to a market in which the John Bull Build-
ing Society, Almost Unlimited, is busy at
work as a borrower.

Juvenile Dead-enders.
Collier, the Westralian Labor leader, in a
melancholy mood: —
In no country in the world is there relatively a
greater army of unskilled boy labor than in Westralia.
Recently I visited the Perth Technical School, where
100 boys aim at becoming electrical engineers. The
director told me that only one place in Westralia
wiU give those boys a chance to learn that, trade,
and that is the Government railway workshops. This
year, the director said, the workshops will absorb
three boys. Eventually, therefore, the other boys
must drift out as hewers of wood and drawers of
water.
Such things are apt to occur where politi-
cians are dominated by the mania for shov-
ing people “on the land.” Westralia lias
been run for 15 years as if that were the be-
all and end-all of government. It lias been
the policy of a succession of Ministries to
furnish a block for anyone (“experience no
object”) who could find an instalment of £lO
or £l5; to pay him through the State Agri-
cultural Bank for clearing it; and, if he got
into difficulties as a result of bad seasons or
bad farming, to let the rent and interest
accumulate, secure him against private credi-
tors, provide him with seed, superphosphate,
implements, machinery and cornsacks, insure
his crop against fire and hail, and even allow
liim wages at the rate of 9s. a day. All
these benefits have been supplied by a State
Industries Assistance Board. Between
July 1, 1906, and June 30, 1923, the gross
public debt increased from £18,058,000 to
£58,485,000, chiefly in consequence of tlie
land-settlement craze. In the time of the
Labor Government a million or so was sunk
in State implement works, freezers, brick-
yards, etc., as a result of which ventures
some private manufacturers were directly
injured by Government competition, others
were discouraged by the fear of it, and all
were penalised via the Taxation Depart-
ment. With that misguided exception,
nothing has been done by recent Westralian
Ministries to assist manufacturing industries
in which, rightly encouraged, thousands of
boys might have learned useful occupations.
Of late a company engaged in producing cry-
stal glass of the finest quality has had to
close down because the cost of transport
over miles of heavy sand tracks was out of
all reason, and the Government refused to
build a £lO,OOO-road. The same Govern-
ment never begrudges £200.000 for the line
from Droughtville to Septoria; also it howls
dismally when it is asked to pay Customs
duty on material which it could have bought
in Australia, although—unfortunately for
Australian industry—it isn’t always asked.
Of course the juvenile dead-ender is not con-
fined to Westralia (albeit he seems to be
more numerous there than elsewhere) ; and
he has mean employers to contend against,
and selfish trade-unions. But his worst
enemy is the kind of Government that over-
concentrates on land-settlement, and neglects
matters equally important, and borrows with
riotous profusion, and buys in the cheapest
foreign market, and has no use for Austra-
lian manufactures.
If Bailiffs Come.
Sydney Telegraph, speaking oil Queensland
and its financial troubles in London, played a
soft and gentle tune :
There is no fear about Queensland or any other
Australian State repudiating its debts. No doubt
America "would be quite willing to buy up the debt
at a price. Wall-street has no fears about any
repudiatory tendencies on the part of Queensland.
The advance will be on the security of the family
name. The American bondholders could not put a
receiver in ii Queensland defaulted because that
would be a seizure of British territory. The dis-
honored bill would, therefore, be presented for col-
lection to the rich parent, who, for the sake of the
family name, would have to honor it, if the Com-
monwealth should first refuse.
The writer belongs to tlie well-known and
popular Pods nap Australis family, who
always assure this community that (1)
there will never be a revolution in Australia,
and (2) no Australian State will repudiate,
or default on, its public liabilities; for if
these tilings happened it would be the first
time they had happened, and nothing serious
ever happens the first time —all important
events begin at the second time, or occur
first on the third occasion. Still, one or two
things are worth considering:—
There would be no logic about the Old Man In
London paying up to save the family name. That
would be lost, anyhow. And to make it known that
the Old Man was liable for one bill would make him
equally liable for so many millions of bills that
he might very reasonably decide to let the name slide.
It would certainly be objectionable if any part or
the Empire was seized for debt, even temporarily, and
occupied as the Ruhr is now, or as many French
departments were in 1871. But the question arises,
to what extent is Australia part of the Empire now?
Certainly not to the old extent. It isn’t hound to
contribute money, soldiers or ships; it has its own
tariff; and it has acquired treaty-making powers and
a separate status in the League of Nations that
leave very little except the Governor-General and the
Privy Council appeal between it and separation.
Things are chapging fast. Great Britain has
acquired for the first time in its history a Prime
Minister who is an International Socialist, and that
isn’t the same thing as a national patriot. He ainl
five other Ministers only resigned from the Inter-
national Socialist Labor Executive because the rules
of that body so commanded. Presumably this was
owing to the fact that the Cabinet isn’t wholly
International.
Though assurances like those of the Tele-
graph are consoling, and all that sort of
thing, it is best to assume that Australia
may have to face its own troubles, even to
the extent of having a bailiff put in. So it
would be no bad mental exercise to think out
in good time what is the best way to pre-
vent bailiffs.

A Bogus Menace and a Real One.
Scratch an Australian Jingo and he invari-
ably turns out to be no patriot but a mere
political wire-puller—a truth which has been
interestingly exemplified of late in the re-
spective cases of Ireland and Egypt. When
the last fortresses of Unionism were capi-
tulating, our die-hards fell hack on the yarn
that an autonomous Ireland was unthink-
able, if only because its geographical posi-
tion rendered it a menace to Britain, and
through Britain to the Empire. No know-
ledgeable person really believed that the
Irish, on being freed of their grievance com-
plex, would bite the hand of the Sassenach
who buys most of their surplus products, or
conspire to ruin the institution on which
their newly-won liberties depend; but it
suited schemers who live politically by set-
ting the Irish against their neighbors to
argue to the contrary. Egyptians have never
emigrated and multiplied and provided the
Empire with inflammatory issues capable of
being exploited advantageously by adven-
turers in the pursuit of votes or office, and
so the very real menace of the Egyptian
situation-*-a menace to the Empire in gen-
eral, and to our end of the far-flung concern
in particular—has been ignored. The Irish
have always found the utmost difficulty in
disliking the English. The two races have
been intermarrying, fighting side by side, and
participating in the same sports for cen-
turies. There is no affinity between the
Englishman and the Egyptian—nothing but
open contempt on the part of the white and
a burning, though abject, hatred on that of
the subservient race. Tlie Egyptians are
not even dependent on England for markets
for their cotton, sugar, petroleum or any
other commodity: the whole world wants
their products. The fraudulency of Erin’s
so-called geographical menace was demon-
strated during the war when, though the
intensification of the German submarine
campaign synchronised with a Sinn Fein
rebellion, no serious enemy attempt was
made to attack through Ireland. It re-
mained first and last what it has
been in all Europe’s wars, great and
small—a backwater. There is nothing
of the backwater, unfortunately, about
Egypt. It is the Rome of the modern
world: all roads lead to it. And there is
this further material difference between Ire-
land and Egypt: Ireland’s De Valera has
lost, while Egypt’s has won. Zaghlul, the
Nationalist martyr, has gained complete inde-
pendence for his country under a constitu-
tional king, and at the recent election he
secured 152 candidates out of a possible 211
in favor of his policy of insisting on the
evacuation of the Canal Zone by the British.
It matters not that the Egyptians are totally
unable to defend themselves, that they are
so lacking in military qualities as to be
notoriously incapable of even standing up to
their primitive neighbors, the Soudanese.
That is to say, it matters not to the bogus
Imperialists who only think of the Empire
in terms of racial or religious strife-monger-
mg, and who are disinterested in Empire de-
velopments which cannot be turned to party
account. They had nothing to say when
the Lloyd George Government gave full self-
government to the key position, through which
two-thirds of our soldiers and practically all
our war-supplies passed during the late war,
and they will have nothing to say when, in
the next few months, the Internationalists
who are now in charge of Britain withdraw
the Imperial garrison, certainly from the
western, and possibly from the eastern, bank
of the Canal.

unexpectedness as Japan. When a reform
committee was created, consisting of General
Primo de Rivera, some of the more intelli-
gent elements of the army and the Bourbon
king (roped in by the sturdy general to
give orthodoxy to the movement), the busi-
ness was, in one sense, easy and simple.
There was no mental wear and tear of dis-
crimination. It was a fairly safe thing to
suspend every political institution in sight,
and to shoot every party boss who didn’t
get away in time, and such of the public
service as didn’t run fast enough. Spain
has two Houses of Parliament of equal
authority, so that the one which says that
tilings are to remain as they are lias always
won. It takes two Houses to make progress,
but one is plenty to make stagnation. One
half the Senate consists of princes, noblemen
with incomes of £2400 a year or more, mili-
tary captains-general and losers of battles,
admirals in the unlucky navy, and a tre-
mendous swag of prelates and law officials —
life nominees. The other half is elected, by
the Church, the Universities (the most back-
ward and mossgrown seats of learning in
Europe) and other quaint institutions. The
Lower House is elected by males over 25
who are on the roll and have a residential
qualification; but as 60 per cent, of the
population can neither read nor write, and
another 20 per cent, are only nominally
literate, somebody helps them to make their
mark, or makes their mark for them. It is
a land of few newspapers, many churches,
strict orthodoxy, schools that are in ruins,
houses of worship that are not in ruins
because the repairs are charged to the taxes,
and political bosses whose bossdom was, till
the other day, the one superbly organised
affair in a disorganised land. Each local
Tammany had its own district (called in
China its “squeeze”), where it intercepted
the revenue, bossed the local administration,
created jobs, appointed itself and its friends
to jobs, and marked the ballot-paper for the
unlettered voter. The motive power behind
the reforming general, who propelled the
army, which shoved the king, was the for-
mation of a solemn, secret, non-taxpaying
league of commercial houses all over the
country. They swore by all the saints that
even if Spain went broke for the fourth
time they would cut off Tammany’s sup-
plies. There are old parties aged 103 in
Spain who lived under the Inquisition, and
the place still supports a Patriarch of the
Indies, though it is years since it had any
Indies, and it keeps on hand a Bourbon
monarchy, though France said it was tired
of Bourbons 76 years ago, and Italy de-
clared that Bourbons were out of date in
1860. In fa<*t, it is the home of bones and
ghosts and aged things. Yet the human
material is good, and when the army oiled
its bow and arrow the other day and went
out to upset the old order it may have
started Spain on the way to be a Great
Power again, as well as a Shining Light.
It really was a Shining Light once; but
the candle requires snuffing.

Immigration.
P>y a medical specialist after digging into
the matter in England:—
The best thing that could happen to Australian
immigration at present is for a Labor Govern-
ment to come into power in Britain. It probably
will mean the cancellation of the iniquitous “Empire
Settlement” agreement, under which the British Gov-
ernment pays half the cost of passages of migrants
from Britain to Australia, as the British Labor
party is strenuously opposed to the policy of emigra-
tion. The result will be that Australia will be
forced to shoulder her own responsibilities, and to
find all the money necessary for immigration. On
the face of it this would appear to cripple immigra-
tion. In reality it will put Australia in the position
—which she does not hold to-day—of being able to
enforce a thorough medical examination for physical
and mental defects in intending migrants, having
first installed an Australian medical service in Great
Britain for that purpose.
The Empire Settlement Act is administered by
the Overseas Settlement Office, working in conjunc-
tion with the Ministry of Labor and Industry, and
more or less in conjunction with the Ministry of
Health. Naturally the Board of Health is not going
to encourage a medical examination which will elimi-
nate as migrants most of the V.D. sufferers, and
leave them to be still a burden upon the country
responsible for them. And the Ministry of Labor
administers the “unemployment dole,” and is not
likely, either, to approve of an examination which
will exclude the unemployable—whether he be funda-
mentally feeble-minded or rendered unemployable
through long periods of demoralising unemployment.
During the last few years Australia House has been
in the habit of recruiting migrants from the unem-
ployment bureaux, where applicants for work or out-
of-work relief are given the choice between emigrat-
ing and having their dole decreased or discontinued.
It is a fact —though ingeniously camouflaged by the
indignant and pained “explanations” of Mr. Percy
Hunter- — that the poorhouses have been circularised
and an offer made that the Governments of Australia
and Britain will jointly pay the expenses to Aus-
tralia of inmates wishing to emigrate, if the
Poor Law Guardians will contribute £ll toward
passage money.
Canada realised from the first that the tempting
bait offered by the Empire Settlement Act concealed
a very business-like hook, and with the exception of
the Province of Ontario, which signed a separate
agreement with the British Government, has declined
to participate in the “benefits” of the Act —except
to a limited extent in the case of juvenile migrants.
And even in regard to these Dr. C. K. Clarke, Pro-
fessor of Psychiatry in the University of Toronto,
warns Canada that a great many mentally deficient
children are being imported (under the Empire
Settlement Act) into Canada from the orphan asylums
of England, and urges a better system of medical
examination for these children. The same doctors,
by the way, examine for Canada and Australia.
In short, the Empire Settlement Act has been
framed along the lines of the popular misconception
that immigration is something invented to relieve
unemployment in Britain, and provide labor for the
Dominions and “customers for British goods”; and
we will never get many of the right kind of immi-
grants working along such lines.

“Lex” : The Melbourne police suspect a
sallow-faced young man with a protruding
lip, which twitches, and an interest in

inoffensive strangers in the Botanic Gardens.
The theory is that the man went amok —

deadly calm. This is always liable to, hap-

the war came to unbalance other minds. The

The A.N.A. was foolish enough to ask Lord
Leveriiulme to lunch, instead of letting him
have a quiet sandwich by himself, and, of
course, he talked :
He admitted that white men live in the Northern
Territory as Government officials or medical men,
reclining under cool verandahs. If it is a white
man’s land, how can you explain that at the 136th
anniversary of the discovery of Australia there are
7000 people in the Northern Territory and over
5,000,000 in the rest of Australia, though the Terri-
tory comprises one-third of the area of the continent.
People don’t seem to like this white man’s land.
While you Australians say you won’t have black
labor for cotton-growing-, the United States won’t
take any more white labor, whether it is English,
Irish, Welsh or Scotch.
Every time the old gentleman speaks he
seems to have lost a little more of his in-
formation. The date wasn’t the 136th anni-
versary of the discovery of Australia; the
N. Territory doesn’t comprise one-third the
area of the continent; and the U.S.A. are
still taking about a quarter of a million of
white immigrants a year exclusive of
Italians —and nearly a hundred thousand of
them are “English, Irish, Welsh or Scotch.
All the same, Leveriiulme should be re-
garded as a blessing in disguise ; for his in-
sistence, however confused and ignorant, on
the dreadfully neglected state of the Com-
monwealth’s garden should make it do some-
thing for very shame to end the discussion.
The 523.620 sq. miles of N.T. are the Com-
monwealth’s garden, and nobody else’s, and
it has been degenerating into a desert and a
cause for scorn ever since the Commonwealth
got it. The Bruce-Page Government pre-
sumably has an idea as to the first neces-
sary step—at least, when it was a question
of the empty State lands between Port
Augusta and Hay it prescribed a railway
right off. and it prescribes the same thing
for the State country between Kyogle and
Beaudesert. And its predecessors thought
of a railway first thing for the good of the
State lands between Port Augusta and Ival-
goorlie.
“T.M.”: A recent Bulletin par. men-
tioned that the current year’s Customs
revenue promised to be £36,000,000, the pay-
ments ranging from £7 Bs. 2d. per head in
N. S. Wales to £1 18s. in Tasmania. These
figures, though no doubt accurate, are liable
to mislead. Owing to Tasmania’s geo-
graphical position, the Navigation Act,
Federal control of lighthouses and other
causes, the greater part of the trade of Tas-
mania is done with the merchants of Sydney
and Melbourne. Last financial year, of the
total Tasmanian trade of £17,055,383, only
£4,010,721 was done outside the Common-
wealth. Tasmania also purchases almost
all her wines, spirits and tobacco from Syd-
ney and Melbourne; hence the excise would
be credited to Victoria or N. S. Wales,
although her merchants not only pay this
but also a percentage of profit on same.
Notwithstanding the many hard things pub-
lished about her penury, Tasmania’s finances
are sound ; but it is a question whether she
can continue as a subscriber to the waste-
ful extravagances of Federation, which has
not materialised to anyone’s satisfaction here
in Hobart, and it may come that a new
slogan will be adopted, “Home Rule for the
Island.”
“Margaret Curran” on Women Voters:—
“J. Hardnock’s” indictment (B. 17/l/’24) that
female enfranchisement is responsible for the decline
in quality of our public men is a strong one;
so is “S. Malapropos” Adamic accusation of feminine
blood-guiltiness in the matter of Hughes, Charlton,
Fuller and Dooley. But except in the age-old way
it seems rather unfair to blame the women for these
four. Two of them, at least, were launched in poli-
tics before women had a vote. “Hardnock” touches
bedrock when he writes that women are less politi-
cally intelligent than men. But that is an effect of
education, not an evidence of mental inferiority.
Awakened by the prod of the franchise a few years
ago, women are still in the stage of “rubbing their
eyes.” Men newly enfranchised did no better—
which may explain the bank-smashes and other
calamities of 30 years ago. Incidentally, “Hard-
nock’s” gibe at woman’s emotionalism is also rather
unfair when one thinks of the ages in which
women have been taught to cultivate their “hearts.”
They are gradually learning to train that more satis-
factory organ, the head, ahd all it implies; and now
witness the male ravings about the loss of the “softer
graces of our women”! Much campaigning forces
me to agree with “J.H.” when he comments on the
emotions and prejudices of women, with their conse-
quent political crudities and the temptation offered
to the professional “politician” to “play up” to these
qualities of the feminine political mind. The remedy,
however, is not disfranchisement, but education of
the right kind. Women act very much as school-
children who, on achieving the liberty of the open
school-gate, give vent to a whoop and cut a few
capers before settling down to the steady homeward
trot. The closer the pen, the louder the screech.
Sometimes the penning of the women has been so
close they don’t screech at all —they just sit, and
knit, as they did in France once upon a time when
heads were falling in baskets. No wonder Clemen-
ceau threatened his country with the barricades at
the prospect of female rule! But he would probably
do nothing worse than write another scenario. One
thing even “J.H.” might give the women voters
credit for. If they haven’t raised the principles of
the public men, they have at least regulated their
practices. The public man of low moral standards
has no hope these days—which may be accounted a
virtue or not. Be that as it may, the women demand
clean living, and, in the main, get it.
“Cartot” : The steady spread southwards
of both malaria and hookworm is disquiet-
ing. Twenty years ago the former was prac-
tically unknown on the east coast, save in
the Cairns and Cooktown districts of North
Queensland. A few years later it had ap-
peared in and around Port Alma and Rock-
hampton, and presently it had worked as
far south as Bundaberg and Maryborough.
Quite recently it reached the country around
the Tweed River in the north of N. S.
Wales. The next stage will almost cer-
tainly take it to Newcastle, where its car-
rier, the anopheles mosquito, is very pre-
valent ; and after that how long will Syd-
ney be safe? Nor has hookworm been far
behind. Once it was something of a medi-
cal curiosity, confined to parts of North
Queensland. Now it may be found all along
the eastern coast, as far south as the area
between Southport (Q.) and Lismore
(N.S.W.). Further south the prevailing
conditions are ideal for the endemicity of
Ankylostoma duodenale —large tracts of
swampy country, with a fair proportion of
the population habitually going without
boots. The United States ignored frequent
warnings to deal with these scourges in the
South before they were well established;
to-day the nation is paying a heavy price for
its remissness.
*
A problem which threatens to rank with the
identity of the Man in the Iron Mask is
bound up with the financial position of Ger-
many. Here is the uncompromising manner
in which A. G. Gardiner, a Liberal jour-
nalist of repute, stated the position in Lon-
don Nation during last Christmas week:—
The British recognise that the savagery with
which she [Germany] has been treated has robbed her
of any immediate power to pay; but they have no
desire to see Germany wiped off the map of Europe,
and no intention of allowing it.
A Sun cable, sent a few days later, told of
the Christmas revels in Berlin and other
cities: —
The streets were packed with hilarious crowds.
Restaurants were filled with people flaunting their
affluence. Regardless of the high prices, hotels arranged
festivities on a lavish scale.
George E. Dickenson, of Musgrove's
Theatres, returned with the news that it was
not the German worker who was up against
it financially, but the Britisher:—
His tour included all the Continental countries,
Great Britain, Canada and the United States, and
he was able to survey world conditions and contrast
one country with the other. German-made goods
were to be found everywhere, and Germany was a
serious competitor against Britain.
And then came these intimations:—
After 10 years’ absence, German buyers are re-
appearing in the shops of . the Rue de la Paix, where
they are extensively purchasing the most expensive
fashionable dresses, jewellery and famous wines.
They pay the highest prices without complaint.
And
The Berlin Government is passing a sort of sump-
tuary law designed to keep its obscenely wealthy
nationals at home.
On all the evidence, pacifist and otherwise,
Germany is an insolvent Rockefeller and
a starving Trimalchio.

“Mrs. Kate Dwyer, perhaps the best-known Labor
woman in N. S. Wales, was defeated for re-election
to the executive of the Annandale branch owing to an
eleventh-hour enrolment of new members—O’Sulli-
vans, Conroys and McGarrys—intent on getting their
own relatives into office.”
’Tis rough on you, Kate. You’re unused to defate,
And for Labor there’s no one that labors
So early and late, or who carries such weight.
’Tis a shame, Mrs. Dwyer, be jabers!
Though you equal whole stacks of Bills and of Jacks
As a grafter, or Toms, Dicks and Harrys,
’Tis of little avail in your own Annandale
When the Conroys are dumped in the opposite scale,
And O’Sullivans stream up the ballot-box trail, .
And they’re out for the spoils, the McGarrys.
Whirroo!
When they’re afther your job, the McGarrys.
Shure, to hear you orate was a rigular trait,
After voices deep-booming and raucous
That roar at the rate of a torrent in spate
When comrades are clustered in caucus.
Your cut and your thrust dialectic were just
As dexterous and deft as your parries.
You could down any male hr debate, I’ll go bail.
But what did it help in your own Annandale
When Conroys rolled up and O’Sullivans set, sail
For the polls in the wake of McGarrys?
. Oehone!
O’Sullivans allied with McGarrys!
Bad cess to them, Kate, you were stirring and straight
And fairest of feminine fighters.
’Tis a stroke of ill fate for the Cause —and the
State—
That they've collared your collar, the blighters !
But when clans such as these coalesce in their threes
One’s taking big chances who tarries.
As for me I should quail to tread on the tail
Of their coats, or to stand in the path of the gale,
When the Conroys are gathering in old Annandale,
And O’Sullivans don their electoral mail
And they sound me “fall-in” for McGarrys.
What ho!
When they pass the word aft for McGarrys.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Temporary peace has been arranged be-
tween the seven Treasurers. The States are
not to dash big loans on the Australian
market, until June 30, though they may take
all that is offering over the Treasury counter,
and they are not to pay more than 6 per
cent. Queensland agrees to hold off pro-
vided the Commonwealth lends it £1,250,000
this half-year, and Westralia, the other
hungry mainland brother, sells its silence for
a loan of £750,000. The remaining four States
come in gratis. This clears the way for the
Federal loan of £19,508,481, to pay off the
soldiers’ gratuity bonds, which bonds W. M.
Hughes shovelled out so gaily when he was
hunting for votes in 1919 and left unpro-
vided for. After June—well, in the 12
months after that, the Commonwealth has
£72,4f2,000 and the States have £35,614,758
to renew in Australia, and the States have
£16,281,063 to renew in London. In addi-
tion the States are unanimously anxious to
borrow lots of new money in both places. It
should be a great time, and anybody who
doesn’t stay alive to see it is a bungler.
There is nothing to be thankful for in
the news that a fourth man —David Master-
ton, a Vic. vigneron—has been appointed to
the Tariff Board. Doubtless the gentleman
makes good wine and breeds fat cattle, but
the Tariff Board, by issuing shoals of re-
commendations for free admission of articles
which Parliament intended to be taxed, lias
added to the tvorries of Australian manufac-
turers. The power to remit duties was re-
served to the Minister of Customs when the
Greene tariff, which has failed lamentably,
was going through, and in some cases it has
been exercised in an amazing fashion.
Since the establishment of responsible
government, in 1851, Liberal-Conservatives
or Conservative-Liberals had held Dalhousie
(Vic.) until last week. Now K. T. Pollard,
a Digger farmer, holds it for Labor. McNab,
the Gnasher, topped the poll on the first
count—the voting was 1570 for McNab,
1522 for Pollard, 1026 for McKenna
( Cockyj and 475 for McCarthy (Indepen-
dent) ; but Pollard got most of the Indepen-
dent’s third and many of the Cocky’s second
preferences. Labor has a knack of holding
Vic. country seats once it wins them. Nine
of the 22 it controls in the Assembly are
now rural. Premier Lawson is displeased
with the farmers who refused to vote No.
2 for McNab, and he will probably not be
sorry if the March F.U. convention gives a
decision that will force a dissolution of
partnership.
S. Australian Premier Barwell says there
shouldn’t be more than two parties—how
else can the majority rule? Barwell is
quite right. There shouldn’t be more than
two parties —on any question. But there is
no reason why they should always be the
same two parties. The majority can rule
if there are 20 parties just as well as if
there are only two, provided the members of
the 20 parties vote honestly. As a matter
of fact when there are only two parties the
minority frequently rules. In a House of
60 members 28 are Blacks and 32 are
Whites, and if in the White caucus 18 vote
Yes and 14 No, the 18, under the two-
party system, control the House of 60 mem-
bers. Which is plain minority rule, in spite
of Barwell.
From a financially-enslaved State: —
Pathetic are the shifts to which a Labor Govern-
ment is reduced when it has to find 25 millions
for an icy creditor and there is only 9s. 2d., or
something like that, in the sinking fund. Just
before Theodore reached the U.S.A. it was given
out that in the allocation of Queensland Government
contracts, British, Australian and American goods
were to get a 5 p.c. preference over foreign stuff,
an additional 5 p.c. going to Queensland articles.
In the present condition of Australian industry, the
tariff having ceased to be protective, a 5 p.c.
preference is useless to manufacturers in N. S.
Wales, Victoria and other States. That has been
shown in the matter of the S.A. railway rolling-
stock ; the wide margin between Australian ami
overseas tenders is Barwell’s excuse for placing
contracts amounting to £1,500,000 abroad. Nor
will the 5 p.c. preference to Queensland manu-
facturers enable them to hold their own with
American competitors. The only effect will be to
increase the inflow of goods from a bad customer
and the outflow of gold to pay for them. There
seems no end to the humiliations which the borrow-
ing madness can bring upon a country.
NOT GREEDY, BUT LIKES A LOT.
“Mr. J. Allan, leader of the Vie. Country Party and deputy-leader of the Government, referring
to the forthcoming redistribution of seats, said that, whatever the scheme brought down was, the country
must lose no seats."
LAWSON : “Come now, we mustn’t be greedy; let us share the cake with little Tommy
Townie!”
ALLAN: “Yes, mar. You can give him what you like, so long as you, don’t touch my
end.”
Every eye in Australia ought to be turned
now and again to Tasmania; for it has
arrived at the port that every other State
is steering for and it may do them good to
learn in advance what it is like. Premier
T vons has notified practically every spending
department and institution in the State that

tional institutions are spared. The Museum,

library have been put on half-time, and the
library is closed for a sufficient number of
hours a day to enable the attendants to
scratch for casual jobs on the wharves or
elsewhere.
Olivier, the new Secretary for India, will
have his hands full. The revolutionary ele-
ments are gaining strength. Recently the
Nationalist members defeated the Govern-
ment on a motion demanding the release of
Gandhi and his friends. When the bureau-
cratic Government of India tastes defeat,
wise men begin to book their passages, which
is exactly what hundreds of British civilian
officials are doing. Indianisation of the mili-
tary and civil services is resulting in a
“white-anting” of the power of the Raj which
experienced men on the spot view with
alarm. The extent of that alarm may be
gauged by the fact that the military esti :
mates comprise 41 millions out of a total
expenditure of 95 millions. A Government
which spends nearly half of the total revenue
on its soldiery is obviously preparing for
some sort of unpleasantness.
Somebody is always finding out the right
sort of settler for the N. Territory. The
other day, for instance: —
Colonel J. E. Davies, of the R.A.S.C., who arrived
by the Benalla. on Friday, gave it as his opinion that
Serbs would make good immigrants for Northern
Australia. .. .They were used to working in a hotter
climate than the hottest part of Australia.
The latitude of Serbia, by the way, corres-
ponds fairly well with that of Geelong.
Another informative party promptly wrote
that President Roosevelt had clutched his
hand 18 years ago, and said with deep
emotion, “Get Italians if you can.” This
paper’s idea is that the N.T. doesn’t remain
unsettled for want of special people-
freaks. dwarfs, giants or folk who talk in
shorthand and wear their faces under their
shoulders. Britain could spare a half-million
people per annum so long as we want them
and could get them to the spot. But tne
worst end of the N.l. is 1900 miles by very
rare boat from Australia s fourth city.
And the best end, where there are hills and
cool weather, is over 100 miles per boot
from where the railway ends, over country
which ignorant people regard as infested by
bears, wolves and pemmican.
From the Gallery :—
Now that the Dalhousie election has been lost,
Premier Lawson can turn his mind to the problem
of reinforcing his Cabinet. When McPherson wept
out it was decided that Lawson himself should look
after the ledger, but there is an impression that
he wants to hand it over to Eggleston. That sturdy
little solicitor, who has earned promotion by his
good work on the Electricity and Gas Commissions,
is ready to accept a full-salaried job but justly
disdains an honorary Ministership. The other honoi-
aries are plumping for elevation by seniority, and
Lawson, who wants Eggleston, partly to keep_ -
other Metropolitan Liberals quiet, doesn t know
how to surmount the difficulty without making some
influential person unhappy. It has been suggests
that as Eggleston is adamant on the size of the plu
he should receive, Lawson might approach one o
the other Met. Libs., but neither Greenwood nor
Snowball is keen on taking anything less than
place in the Cabinet.
While Ramsay Macdonald was forming his
Ministry a report got about that lan Haim
ton was to have the War portfolio,
would have been an interesting appointment;
thrice interesting to Australia, since llami -
ton penned the following last August.
By denouncing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty we have
entrusted the safety of Australia to—we don t really
quite know to whom or to what. Di. E. Page, Au.
tralian Minister of Finance, has announced that his
Government is reserving £2,500,000 of its suiplus
of £7,475,000 for urgent defence works, in the
event of the failure of the Imperial Confeience to
formulate a scheme satisfactory to Amstialia. he
sooner he starts spending that money the bettei.
The job went to one Walsh, here unknown
Somebody may have shown Macdonald the
cutting.
Machinery imported by the Cadbury-! 1 ry-
Pascall firm was allowed in free of duty on
the ground that it couldn’t be manufactured
in Australia. Actually, £57,000 worth of simi-
lar machinery had been made in Victoria ini
Macßobertson. Again, machines for sitting
cocoa-powder from crushed beans were duty-
free in Cadbury’s case, but when Macßobcrt
son landed two a 40 p.c. duty was chargee.
In short, the full pound of flesh was exacted
from a pioneer Australian manufacturer, bu
special favors were extended to strangers
about to compete with him.
A brief summary of the case:
Fourteen pages of the report of the Fedeia
Auditor-General deal with defaults and irregularities,
six pages relate to accounts reported as unsatisfac-
tory, and two pages are devoted to details ot pay-
ments without vouchers, or with imperfect vouchei ...
Some good might come of all this if the A.-G.
had even a quarter the authority of that
gentleman in Spain who has suspended the
unsatisfactory and swindling civil service
almost holus bolus, and has saved £f>,OOO,LUO
in the first three months of the new regime.
Rut the initials might stand for “Acting the
Goat” so far as the chance to do things is
concerned.
Westralian Premier Mitchell won’t have
the drink question entangled with general
elections. The other day a “dry” deputation
waited on him witli a request for a local
option poll to be held triennially on the same
day as the Parliamentary polling. Mitchell
told them it wasn’t a fair thing, and it isn t.
The very essence of the referendum idea is
to get a verdict on one subject independent
of all others; and for that reason, wherever
possible, the referendum should be cut clear
of elections. When you are considering
whether you want a pair of socks you don t
want that question mixed up with the ques-
tion whether you need a haircut.
“Rienzi”; Federal roundsmen have been
noting the growing friendship . between
Austin Chapman and Earle Page. Before
he attained Cabinet rank Page was too busy
with private affairs to start ententes with
political acquaintances, but since he became
a semi-demi-Prime Minister he has culti-
vated Chapman with assiduity. They are
nearly always together, head to head in the
departments, or chumming over a midday
snack. The pair have been dubbed by a
Laborite “The Unheavenly Twins,” but
a caustic Nationalist reckons they should be
known as “The Cat and the Canary.’
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Under the N.S.W.
Labor regime it was decreed that children
could be released from school-work three
times per annum to witness educational
films, the idea being that the screening of
pictures of Australian industries, travel and
national history would not only educate the
children and teach them to know their coun-
try, but might encourage an Australian in-
dustry. The three half-day special holidays
are still allowed, but the pictures need not
be Australian; and, as the picture-distribu-
tors are mainly Yankee-controlled, they come
from anywhere but Australia. It is hard
for a Government to be worse than the last
N.S.W. Labor lot;- but Fuller’s Ministry
often manages it.
More trouble threatens in Fiji:—
The Indian agitator is again making his voice
heard here in Fiji. The latest cause of complaint
is the residential-tax which the Government is try-
ing to collect. Fijians already pay a poll-tax, and
now a pound per head is asked from Gunga Din.
The Indians, who hate parting with money, shrill a
protest and demand that the Government get vessels
and transport them at once back to India. Some
politicians are urging the Government to call the
bluff by insisting upon the registration of all coolies
desirous of returning to the Hoogli, or whatever it
is that Ram Chowder calls his home-stream. The
tax is sd. a week, and, as the Indian laborer earns
from 18s. to £1 in that time, he has not got much
of a kick coming on account of “robbery or exploita-
tion” ; and without him there would be little need
for police-courts or policemen. All the same, the
tax is giving Ram Chowder a pretext for making
trouble, and it won’t he surprising to see a recurrence
of the strikes and riots of 1920.

The figures in the talile differ from those
in the accounts, which do not reckon addi-
tions to reserves as profit—it is a way
shipping ofiices have. The £19,281 for the
past year was made up like this: —
Profit as per P. &L. account. . . . £15,029
Net addition to insurance reserve.. 4,210
~ „ ~ contingency fund.. 42
£19,281
There is now £20,891 in the insurance re-
serve and £2OB in the contingencies account.
General reserves of £68,992 and a carry-
forward balance of £3OO make up the re-
serves shown by the table. Probably neither
the profits nor accumulated surpluses give
the full measure of what those inside have
handled. The extent of depreciation allow-
ances is not disclosed, and that is one
capacious bunker in which shipping cos. —
even the coastal traders —store profits which
are not required for divs. The Newcastle
and Hunter River Co. has not been an ex-
ception to the general,practice; for instance,
in order to steer clear of the Federal income-
tax dragnet, the management in 1919 con-
fided that at June, 1914, its actual reserves
were £98,108 instead of £18,153 which the
accounts at that date had disclosed. The 6 and
7 p.c. divs. and visible additions to reserves
for many years prior to 1914 had suggested
that the co. was not fattening, but it was
doing very much better than the directors had
admitted at the time. During the past two
years, owing to the industrial set-back to
Newcastle and droughty conditions along the
Hunter Valley, business has not been so
brisk ; but the 10 p.c. divs. and additions to
visible reserves hint that at least adequate
provision has been made for depreciation,
etc.
Shareholders are doing very well nowa-
days ; for four of the half-dozen years in
which 10 p.C; divs. have been distributed,
the rate has applied to paid capital which
is one-third bonus scrip : £50,000 was taken
from reserves in the 1920 financial year to
make £150,000 paid up. The following com-
parisons summarise balance-sheet movements
since 1914. and indicate the co.’s present
strong position :
June, Dec., Dec., Dec.,

Freeholds,
steamers, etc. 47,832 106,796 172,775 163,844
During the 1922 financial year the s.s.
Gwydir was added to the fleet; hence the
cut into liquid assets in that year. During
the past 12 months the 94-ton wooden-
steamer Wyalong was sold. At December 31
the co. had no less than £82,315 in Govern-
ment securities and cash balances, and they
and other liquid assets exceeded all liabili-
ties by £90,392, which was slightly more
than 12s. per £1 share. The book value
of ships and freehold properties was 21s.
lOd. more. Investors expect the co. to do
better than 10 p.c. later on; 40s. 6d. has
lately been paid for scrip, and a 10 p.c. div.
gives only a 5 p.c. return at that price.

Midway in the year the directors returned
ss. per share, reducing scrip to 15s. fully-
paid. Paid capital is now £52,369, a few
unissued shares having been allotted during
the period. As the money held in readiness
for the return of capital could have earned
only two or three hundred pounds, the re-
duced capital can be credited with having
produced almost all the £15,607 profit shown
in the table, a return exceeding 35 p.c.
Possibly taxation has to be deducted; the
directors regularly appropriate portions of
profit for a contingency fund, and subsequent
accounts show withdrawals which are de-
tailed in the written-off column of the table.
Even assuming that the whole of the amount
earmarked for the contingency fund this
year (£3710) is taken by taxes, etc., the
balance equals 28 p.c. on capital. The co.’s
wonderful run is explained by the manage-
ment’s estimate of total property sales which
have been recorded by the trade: —

It. and W.’s share of the 1922 business ex-
ceeded a million ; for the past 12 months the
management says that it was “identified
with” £1,601,142 of sales. Commission earn-
ings and interest totted up £36,250, which
was only £440 less than for 1920, when Gov-
ernment spendings of borrowed millions and
the easily-made money of the trading-boom
had created an unprecedented demand for
real estate and city premises. The renewed
activity in land-dealing last year is the most
striking evidence of how rapidly the Com-
monwealth’s congested cities recovered from
the post-war depression. To some extent the
bigger figures are accounted for by the de-
velopment of manufacturing industries; on
the other hand, much of the turnover of
suburban vacant land is not necessarily a
sign of healthy prosperity. Many of the
transactions are by small speculators pur-
chasing on easy t.-p. terms. R. and W.’s
accounts at December 31 showed £19,217 of
deposits on sales, and on the other side,
£50,195 of “advances” on properties.
The following comparisons of balance-
sheet figures show how easily the co. repaid
£17,412 of capital during the year, and also
disclose how comfortable is its position:—
1915. 1921. 1922. 1923.

The final div. (2s. per share) took £6982,
and after extracting that there was a sur-
plus of cash and odds-and-ends of £17,860
over all liabilities. That surplus and the
£50,195 of advances together made up a
backing of 19s. 6d. per 155.-paid share.

Prior to the war this big Maoriland meat-
shipping co. was paying 10 p.c. on £169,150
of capital, and had reserves of almost equal
size to help earnings. Nowadays the man-
agement is given the task of finding divs.
for £600,000 of capital, which is backed by
£137,000 of visible reserves. War contracts
gave the co. luscious profits, and the trade
boomed to such an extent during the abnor-
mal period that works were rushed up speci-
ally to meet the demand. Between 1915-20
the book value of land, buildings, machinery,
plant, etc., leaped from £273,522 to £852,674.
The directors called in £127,000 of new capi-
tal, which was accompanied by £31,400 of
share premiums ; the rest was financed by
current profit balances, and by turning a
surplus of liquid assets amounting in 1915
to £235,200 into an excess of liabilities
amounting in 1920 to £lOl,lOO. Meanwhile
the £300,000 of paid capital was doubled by
capitalising reserves. Then, almost without
warning, came the termination of Govern-
ment buying and the slump ; within a few
months prices fell from 50 to 75 p.c., and
for a time there was no market whatever.
In the collapse some Maoriland freezing
works fell into the hands of the banks, par-
ticularly those which had depended over-
much on borrowed funds to finance their
boom-time expansion, and several are still
stabled among the bank’s doubtful accounts,
where they are liable to eat up some inner
reserves before they are got rid of.
The N. Z. Refrigerating Co., being a big,
lusty concern, was more fortunate than
-most. It cleared its stocks before prices
went to bedrock, and it was financially
strong enough to weather the period of re-
stricted trading at low prices. Published
accounts are not sufficiently detailed to indi-
cate the extent to which its business slumped,
or how the average div. of almost 7 p.c. for
the past three years was earned. The co.
did remarkably well to show profits of
around £49,000 for each of the past three
years; on total funds that profit gave 64
p.c. During last financial year the co. sold
its Pukeuri works to the Waitaki Farmers’
Freezing Co., Ltd., but whether at a profit
or loss on book value has not been disclosed.
Portion of the purchase price was satisfied
by the acceptance of debentures, and the
effect of the deal is shown in the following
comparisons of grouped balance-sheet figures,
the £151,150 of Pukeuri debentures having
been included with liquid assets :• —
1920. 1921. 1922. 1923.
Liabilities . . £635,346 £705,064 £428,379 £318,705

Other assets. . 534,233 525,289 238,302 299,962
The feature of the comparisons is the shrink-
age of figures compared with two years ago,
and the reduction of the excess of liabilities
over liquid assets from £179,775 to £18,743
in the same period. That improvement de-
pends, of course, on how liquid is the mort-»
gage on the Pukeuri property—in other
words, how the enterprise will fare in the
hands of the Waitaki farmers. The pros-
pects for the N. Z. R. Co. appear to be
fairly bright, but its very extensive works
will require a much greater trade than the
co. formerly had to give reasonable rates
of divs. on the bonus-inflated capital. The
old hands, of course, are doing very well
even with 61 p.c.

Tiie £lOO,OOO which this co. paid in shares
for the assets and business of the Rosella
Preserving Co. Pty., Ltd., in 1910 included
an unspecified amount for goodwill. That
intangible asset is still lumped with fixed
assets in the published balance-sheets,
consequently in the introductory table
reserves are treated as nominal. But
as accumulated profits now exceed 42
p.c. of the capital with which the co. began,
the goodwill consideration has long since
been replaced by assets which help earnings,
and actual reserves over and above goodwill
are substantial. The Rosella Co. is much
quieter than its feathered namesake; the
directors’ reports do not chirp a note as to
the condition of trade, etc., in any financial
year. Their accounts, however, though not
fully detailed, disclose sufficient to show that
the business has made splendid progress, and
that the co.’s affairs are very comfortable.

Taking into account the numerous casualties
among the preserving cos. after the war-boom
and when markets became glutted, the
Rosella’s performances have been astonish-
ingly good. A couple of years ago, during
the slump, the cheeriest optimist could not
have dreamt of a 50 p.c. improvement in
factory profits, which the latest accounts dis-
close. The past 12 months produced net
profits equal to more than 16 p.c. on capital
after 8f p.c. of the book value of properties,
plant, goodwill, etc., had been written off.
Two £25,000 lots of new capital were in-
troduced to ease the pressure of outside debt
caused by the expanding business —in the
1919 and 1922 financial years. But surplus
profits accumulated since the beginning have
assisted almost to the same extent —perhaps
even more, because the appropriations for
depreciation appear to have been liberal.
Balance-sheet figures compare in this way
over 10 years:—

Since 1913 the tally of all liquid assets W
moved from £83.532 to £158,063, and of fixed
assets from £59,772 to £94,582. The increase
in the two groups has been £109,341. Fresh
capital accounted for £50,000 of it, additional
outside money (depositors and creditors)
for £16,459, and the balance (£42,882) was
the accumulation of profit prior to paying
the past year’s 12J p.c. div. That good
rate has been made possible chiefly by the
conservative policy of the directors during
the years when they kept divs. down and
built substantial reserves: in the three years
1913-15, for instance, shareholders received
£23ft>oo while £14,557 was laid aside. The
co. is very snug: at October 31 last
stocks, book debts, Government securities
and cash showed a surplus of £97,791 over
and above all liabilities and the div. appro-
priation.

After three dull years, in which ordinaries re-
ceived only one 5 p.c. div., the Sulphide Corp.
made a splendid recovery in the 12 months
to June 30 last. The directors hoped to
pay 20 p.c. all round, but a week or so after
the year closed the outlook was entirely
altered by the fire in the, Central mine,
which is still consuming the forest of tim-
ber in the old workings. Manager James
Hebbard and his stall are exercising all
their ingenuity to stifle the trouble and flood
the affected area. So far the extent of the
loss cannot be gauged; but in the five
months to December more than £lOO,OOO had
been spent in checking the fire, the mine is
shut down and seven months of excellent
metal markets have been lost, and the Corp.
is faced with a large expenditure in making
the workings safe again when mining can
be resumed.
Last year’s improved profits were almost
wholly due to the big cut made in expendi-
ture :

The quantity of material handled was
slightly less than in 1922: 114,492 tons
crudes against 120,810 tons, and 26,958 of
dump slimes compared with 27,131 tons.
However, cost per ton concentrates from
crudes was 3s. 2d. less (£ll 12s. Bd.) and
cost of concentrates from slimes was 22d.
down (20s. Bd.). The abandoning of smelt-
ing at Cockle Creek and the treatment of
lead-concentrates by the Associated Smelters
at Pirie apparently also resulted in a big
saving. Besides having benefited by reduced
costs, improved treatment practice at Broken
Hill and better metal markets had a big
influence in the final count. One problem
given considerable attention in recent years
has been how to win more of the lead and
silver which found their way into the zinc
concentrates, where they are practically lost.
Broken Hill metallurgists responded well;
for 1923 81 p.c. of lead contents were re-
covered in the leady concentrates compared
with 78.7 p.c. in the previous year, and 67.5
of the silver instead of 64.1 p.c. Combined
recoveries of metal in marketable form last
year wmre: Silver. 92.7 p.c.; lead, 93.4 p.c.;
zinc., 94.1 p.c. The two principal products
—lead concentrates (26.908 tons) and zinc
concentrates (33,725 tons) —showed the fol-
lowing contents and assay values: —
Silver. Lead. Zinc.

zi f 338,494 oz. 1,915 tons. 16,417 tons.
\ 10.0 oz. 5.7 p.c. 48.7 p.c.
A feature of treatment in recent years has
been the blending of old dump slimes with
crudes: last year 26,958 tons of slimes were
put through in this way.
The Sulphide Corp. does not depend wholly
on silver, lead and zinc; but those metals
last year accounted for a larger proportion
of profits than in the previous period,
because the demand for sulphuric acid and
superphosphates shrank considerably owing
to the industrial depression at Newcastle
and the drought in farming districts.
Briefly the field of the Corp.’s operations is
as follows :—-

newal of timbering. Ore reserves in sight exceed
1£ million tons, and there are known bodies proved
by diamond-drilling below the lowest level now being
worked (1400 ft.) ; though not much dependence can
be placed on opening up extensive bodies there. In
proved ore-reserves there are about 11 years’ work
at the recent rate of extraction.
(2) The Junction mine, which was purchased for
£75,000 after the Central caught fire so that mill-
feed could be found for the Central plant and the
organisation kept together. Though it might not
have considered the purchase under normal circum-
stances, the Corp. believes it made a good deal.
Manager Hebbard thinks he can dig out the rich ore
in the area which was affected by the “creep” of
some years ago, and he also hopes to reclaim the
zinc tailings which were used for filling worked-out
stopes when that residue had no apparent value.
Altogether he hopes to win a half-million tons of
ore and zinc tails from the Junction.
(3) Dump slimes totalling 120,000 tons averaging
about l6oz. silver, 17 p.c. lead and 21 p.c. zinc,
which modern metallurgical practice has brought
within range of highly profitable treatment.
(4) The chemical and super works at Cockle Creek,
a side-line which has developed into a big affair.
Production for four years has been:—
Sulp. Acid Superphosphates
(tons). (tons).
1920 .. 13,222 17,398
1921 .. 21,737 26,991
1922 .. 22,060 29,173
1923 11,968 17,186
The capacity of the super, plant is 40,000 tons
p.a., and the management expects to increase its
trade; only about 45 p.c. of N. S. Wales agricultural
areas are at present manured, compared with 80
p.c. in S. Aus. and 87 p.c. in Victoria.
(5) The complete smelting and refining works at
Cockle Creek. These works a few years ago handled
a big customs trade besides Central mine lead-con-
centrates. The Corp., having linked up with the
B.H.A.S. at Pirie for treatment of its own products,
has closed these works. But other interests are being
established; the property contains 820,000 tons or
so of clays and shales suitable for cement-making,
so 215 acres of limestone ground has been purchased
at. Attunga, near Tamworth (N.S.W.), and contracts
have been placed for the erection of a plant at
Cockle Creek to produce 30,000 tons cement annually,
with provision for doubling that output. Electrolytic
Zinc is also co-operating at Cockle Creek: it has
erected furnaces to roast zinc-concentrates, and the
Corp. will take the sulphur fumes for acid manu-
facture at a cost which is expected to be no higher
than is at present paid for imported sulphur.
(6) The Central zinc and acid works at Seaton
Garew (Eng.). After years of vicissitudes, some
headway appears to have been made in the pro-
duction of zinc. The old roasters have been dis-
mantled and new furnaces put in, and the works,
tue directors say, “had quite a satisfactory year.”
The modernisation of plant is proceeding, and the
Board of Trade has obliged with an assurance of
adequate supplies of zinc-concentrates, on “satisfac-
tory terms,” until 1930. Meanwhile acid is being
produced at full capacity.
(7) Shares in other cos. In Durelco, Ltd., an
English concern interested in the manufacture of
electric-lamps, wire-filaments and molybdenum pro-
ducts, the Corp. holds shares written down in its
books from 10s. to 8s. —totalling £61,223. There
is also a holding of 74,000 £1 fully-paids in the
Australian Lysaght co.
Besides all these interests, at June 30 last
the Corn, held public securities totalling
£703,427. Its liquid position was never
stronger:—-
1919. 1920. 1922. 1923.
Liquid assets 1,282,207 1,160,125 1,209,132 1,387,570
Liabilities. . 473.539 554,743 491,401 551,922
Surplus assets £808,668 £605,382 £717,731 £835,648
Paid capital is £1,050,000, and almost 16s.
in the £ was represented by assets apart
from mines, properties, works, plant, etc.
Fixed assets have a book value of £1,105,536,
which is much less than original cost and
present value. The latest divs., by the way,
took the total distribution to almost three
millions.

Patrick Steamships, Ltd., has been so suc-
cessful since it reduced freights that the
directors are now seeking more capital to
put bigger steamers on established runs. The
present co. was formed to take over the assets
of the Patrick S.S., Ltd., which crashed in
the post-war slump in shipping values and in
the trade depression. Altogether the old co. laid
out nearly £150,000 on ships and on build-
ing up the business; the new one took over
the assets (but not the liabilities) on an
undertaking to pay £67,500 in instalments
over a long period. The present co. is,
therefore, capitalised on a moderate scale,
particularly as it took over a going concern
with an inter-State organisation. The
Associated cos. have made several attempts
to push the enterprise off the seas, but ship-
pers have continued faithful to the inde-
pendent concern; for the last three months
of 1923 cargo carried averaged more than
20.000 tons per month, and the turnover for
the quarter was £56,170. Captain Patrick,
who founded the enterprise, thinks still bet-
ter business is ahead, and proposes to take
advantage of a favorable opportunity of put-
ting additional tonnage in commission, and
of freeing the business of its obligation to
the liouidator of the old co. The public is
offered 200,000 £1 ordinaries, payable ss. on
application. 2s. 6d. on allotment, and the
balance in half-crown monthly calls.
Lander Oil, operating at Oralla, about 30
miles from Roma (Q.), is the first Austra-
lian drilling co to produce evidence of oil
in its bore. Government drilling operations
at Roma, which produced petroleum gases,
encouraged the Lander to tackle the Oralla
area, where the geological structure appeared
favorable. The co. commenced drilling with
an expert Californian team on November 21
last. At the end of January the well was
down 2200 ft., and, according to managing-
director Duncan Milsom, “both oil and gas
were coming through with sufficient pressure
to make further progress a danger, unless
the well was cemented and cased, with a dis-
tributing head at the surface.” The next
few weeks will be devoted to cementing and
casing, and then an effort will be made to
“bring in” the oil. Meanwhile, the Lauder
management very wisely issues the warning
that it is “not in a position to say whether
the oil find is a commercial one.” Hence so
far there is no justification for anything but
hope.
A feature of the Lander oil strike was
that “optimistic Alf” Jones, Minister for
Mines, 'appears to have rushed enthusiasti-
cally into print on the unsupported assertion
of an officer of the co. as to the occurrence.
The Minister, before making an official
announcement, would have been wise to have
given his technical officers an opportunity to
pronounce their verdict and submit analyses.
* * * *
Queensland Cabinet executed a volte face
with lightning celerity last week on the
question of the State oil reserve, near Roma
(B. 31/l/’24). The Government recanted
on locking up 3600 sq. miles which had
shut several Australian cos. out of a likely
area. Arthur Moore and the A. O. Corp.
were then free to take up their desired
blocks, and the former immediately got busy
to float in on the crest of the Lander boom.
Two days later they were confounded by
Cabinet reversing the decision, and deciding
to keep the 3600 sq.' miles for the State,
although not a penny is available to
do any boring. It seems probable that
“strong man” Theodore heard of the first
decision and the Lander strike concurrently,
and thereupon issued a ukase to stick to the
lot for the State, pending developments.
Notwithstanding the recent find, several
geologists doubt whether the horizon now
being tested at Orallo will prove to have a
commercial flow; if it doesn’t the other cos.
may get their chance later on.
Papua fell into line with the Northern
Territory with the promulgation of the
Mineral Oil and Coal Ordinance. 1923, on
Jan. 7. Provision is made for private pros-
pecting under regulations which came into
force at the same time as the Ordinance.
Only cos. can operate, and a preponderance
of British citizens is required. A co.
cannot hold more than one license at any
time without express permission. A reserve
of 1000 sq. miles has been proclaimed around
the present bores at Popo. Papua is very
excited over the new legislation, and wonders
what is to be done with the reserved area.
The Anglo-Persian Co. is still in occupation
of Popo under the old agreement with the
Commonwealth, and has commenced sinking
a No. 2 bore on the top of the ridge on which
No. 1 rig was built. Indications in No. 1
were promising, but pressure beat the bit
after it had pushed down to 1670 ft. into blue
mud.
* » o a
From “Talpa.” one of the few genuine oil-
experts in the Commonwealth :
“Mining Engineer’s” remarks (B. 24/l/’24) are true
only in a limited sense. Seepages are valuable signs,
but one cannot generalise by saying “it is safe to lay
down as a cardinal point that oil outcrops, in the
form of either gas, bitumen springs or actual oil
seepages, must be found before there is justification
for wasting large sums of money in boring.” Seep-
ages such as those in Noumea, New Guinea and at
some places in Maoriland illustrate how unreliable
they can sometimes be. The rocks in these instances
are tilted at such an angle that accumulation in
commercial quantities is impossible. However, there
have been, with one or two exceptions, no recorded
instances of seepages of oil or gas in Australia, so
there is not much room for “wild-catting” on them.
On the other hand, anyone familiar with oil history
knows how the Illinois field (U.S.A.), which produced
158 million barrels between 1905-11, was dis-
covered br r coal prospectors; there were no surface
indications whatever. Drilling for water in the
Argentine opened up the Commodore Rivadavia pool,
which produced over two million barrels in 1922.
There were no surface signs there either. The
Thrall, Corsicana and Electra pools, in Texas, were
also discovered when drilling for water, and the El
Dorado (Kansas) pool was prospected simply on the
strength of seemingly favorable conditions.
Van der Leek, in his 1921 report on the Petroleum
resources of California, summed up the conditions as
follows:
(1) There must be present in close association with
the prospective field, thick beds of organic shale to
serve as a source for the oil.
(2) There must be present either in, or above, the
organic shale, porous beds, between impervious beds,
to act as a reservoir for the oil.
(3) The reservoir beds must be folded in a favor-
able structure, so as to cause the oil to accumulate.
(4) There must be a large area of accumulation.
(5) There must not be too great an interval in
geological time between the organic shales and the
formations composing the reservoir.
A combination of these conditions is available in
various localities in the Commonwealth, but cnly
the drill will show whether they contain oil or gas
in commercial quantities.

London is looking into the possibilities of
the Ruby Creek silver-lead proposition, on
Mt. Werong, 30 miles west of Oberon
(N.S.W.), and about 15 miles’ crow-fly from
the famous little Yerranderie field. The
leases total 40 acres, and the ore-body or
channel has been traced for about half a
mile in length and for a hundred yards wide,
with three main shoots showing. Most of
the work so far has been on No. 2 shoot,
which gives promise of large bodies of high-
grade ore. Numerous Mines Department
assays have ranged from 20 p.c. to 70 p.c.
lead, and from 250 z. to 300 oz. silver per
ton, with traces of gold. The shaft is down
40ft. on this shoot, w r ith values all the way,
and good indications underfoot. A tunnel
260 ft. down the hillside from the shaft is in
600 ft., and both the Nos. I and 2 shoots have
been passed through. Work so far has had
Government aid, but the co. now running
the proposition is too weakly financed to
equip it and make the most of the finds.
Ruby Creek requires an expenditure of about
£15,000 to make it a producer, and London
interests are considering whether to give it
a go.

Adelaide is also trying to infuse a little
market interest in the north end of the lval-
goorlie field. As a result of the Great Boulder
Co. taking over the Golden Zone, all the old
failures in the neighborhood have been re-
pegged, and fancy prices, running in some
cases into five figures, arc being asked for
them. Some good shows have been worked
from time to time in the locality, but most
have been small affairs. In the case of the
Golden Zone, the Great Boulder has a mine
opened up to a depth of several hundred feet,
in which a lot of crosscutting, driving and
winzing has been done. Several levels of
payable ore were developed by previous
owners; but there is no certainty that the
shoot will live down like those in the Golden
Mile group at the south end. Development
only can determine that. An attempt is sure
to be made, both in Kalgoorlie and Adelaide,
to unload some of the surrounding rubbish
on the public.

When Whim Well copper (W.A.) was
looking for a new process last year Minerals
Separation, Ltd., of London, made an offer
to put in a “pilot” plant to prove the worth
of its process. It is now experimenting at
the Roebourne mine and claims to be getting
good results. At one time it was thought
that the Perth Copper Separation Co.’s pro-
cess would be adopted by Whim Well, but
London finally rejected the management’s
recommendation to give it a trial.
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) has obtained
further exemption on the plea that the
Board needs more time to find another mine
which could be worked in conjunction with
the Bullfinch. There are one or two in the
neighborhood which might suit, but the
prices asked are too stiff.

Ivanhoe fW.A.) has taken an option on
the Gwalia Consolidated leases at Wiluna,
and is proceeding to test their value. Should
the option be exercised, Ivanhoe will re-
ceive one-third of the shares in a new co.
with a capital of £600,000. Other shows
at Wiluna are being offered to London and
Adelaide, and already many new “mines”
are being counted before the surface is
scratched.

An obscure venture known as Westralian
Mines Syndicate, which holds small interests
at Kalgoorlie and Yalgoo, announces that
expensive labor conditions and the difficulty
of getting tributors have compelled it to
abandon one show and only hang on to an-
other as a machinery and tailings area. The
co. intends to mark time until more favor-
able conditions prevail.
Westralian Mining Association held its
annual meeting in Perth the other day.
Chairman J. S. Allen said that the Asso-
ciation’s remedies for reviving “a dying in-
dustry” were: (1) Greater security of
tenure; (2) five years’ exemption from all
Federal and State taxation; (3) better
facilities for training youths as miners;
and (4) removal of the “oppressive burdens”
of the tariff. Somebody should read them the.
parable about the dog and the moon.
Clark’s, Charters Towers (N.Q.), has had
no luck so far in the work undertaken with
the aid of the Government subsidy. The
underlie shaft is now down over 100 ft. below
the No. 12 level, and is at the spot where Billy
Clark thought he had a good chance of un-
earthing another pay shoot. The formation
there proves small, with splashes of ore.
No. 13 level is now being driven, and a
winze is going down from No. 12, and if
nothing turns up in either of these workings
an early funeral is almost a certainty.

The output of gypsum in South Australia
has increased from 1717 tons in 1915 to
nearly 50,000 tons last year. Gypsum is
used in the manufacture qf plaster. Prior
to the war the Commonwealth was depen-
dent on outsiders for most of its plaster, but
besides providing supplies for all States, S.
Aus. has opened up markets in Maoriland
and Noumea. Three cos. are working the
deposits; the largest is the Peninsula Plaster
Co., at Stenhouse Bay, on the southern coast
of Yorke Peninsula. This co. has converted
a “no man’s land” into a hive of industry ;
nearly 100 men are employed there. In addi-
tion to constructing a jetty, erecting a fac-
tory, and installing the latest machinery the
co. has built houses for its married em-
ployees, a boarding-house for single men, and
a recreation hall. Altogether more than
£50.000 has been spent. S. Aus. has prac-
tically inexhaustible supplies of gypsum:
the deposits near Lake Mac Donnell are esti-
mated to contain 70 million tons.

“G.A.C.” : There was a big festa to cele-
brate the wedding of a Governor’s private
secretary and a charming English girl. Some
OH, THESE MEN!
PHYLLIS : “Men are the most changeable things on earth!”
MILDRED: “Whatever makes you think that, darling?”
PHYLLIS : “Well, only last week 1 was desperately in
love with Roy; and now I simply can't stand him.”
300 guests were asked up to Government
House after the ceremony to sip a cup of
tea, and they all racked their brains to think
of suitable presents. Bride and ’groom were
almost unknown to the society of those parts,
and no one felt inclined to make his gift too
elaborate. So various groups decided to club
together, and get a really worth-while gift
or two. But they did not want to be alto-
gether unrepresented on the table where the
offerings were spread out, so each sent along
some tiny personal token as well. Then a
diligent press printed a complete list of gifts,
and some of the wealthiest people in the
town woke up to find that they had contri-
buted a coat-hanger or a pipe to the trous-
seau, with no mention, of course, of the
little cheque that had gone towards the big
gift. The women liked it less than ever
when their dearest enemy met them in the
street and remarked sweetly, “I see you
gave the bride a bottle of bath salts, dear.
So nice of you to think of it; and I don t
see why people should waste their money in
giving extravagant presents, do you?”
The office butler makes some remarks :
There is no such thing as an aristocratic face ' n
Britain, where the shop-assistant of to-day is liable
to be the peer of to-morrow; on the other hand,
there is a well-defined anti-Labor face. The photo-
graphs of a couple of dozen mostly youthful scions
of noble houses who have contested Parliamentary
seats, as either Tories or Whigs, show that they
all have this variety of face. The brow is incon-
spicuous, and above it usually is a wealth of smooth,
dipped hair. The nose is delicate and well shaped,
and the mouth small and, even when compressed
like that of a subaltern who has just rapped out a
parade-ground order, somewhat characterless. The
general effect is one of suavity, health and well-
barbered comeliness. A score of wax models, such
as haberdashers use to display their wares, could
not look smoother. Turn now to the faces of
men in the same class of life who are associated
with Labor. Excluding the smug-looking Chelms-
ford, the bearers of titles or of historic names are
mostly as rough as bags. Arthur Ponsonby, for
example, whose forebears fought at Bannockburn
and who was once a page at Court, and Lord Hal-
dane ; and the Etonian who is said to have
originated the idea of a capital levy. Out of Par-
liament it is the same. Bertrand Russell, Socialist
and world-famous mathematician, suggests a dis-
hevelled usher rather than the grandson of an earl.
As evidence that intellectuality has nothing to do
with the phenomenon, consider the case of Lord
Birkenhead, one of the most uncompromising anti-
-I,aborites in England. No one does more credit to
his tailor, there are few better brains in the land,
and his face is as vacuous as any of those in the
group above mentioned. He is transparently anti-
Labor from the collar up.

“Senojo”: Re Pentridge’s “underground”
route (B. 24/l/’24). A large proportion of
the prisoners’ tobacco supply came m on
the provision waggons, and was provided by
the charitable public. While the good-con-
duct men were loading or unloading, at the
station, it was a common practice for
Coburg’s smokers to pass casually and drop
a bit of the weed where it could be easily
collected. The practice, until the recent
tightening of affairs, was rather a habit with
many of the local smokers; and the act was
regarded as the day’s good deed.
* * * *
“Howitzer” : I had a cobber
who told me just before a hop-
over was due that he felt sure
he’d go west —he’d dreamt that
he had been run through with
a bayonet. I tried to reason
with him, but, rather than go
into the line, to my amazement
lie deserted. The hop-over duly
came off, and on reaching safety
once more I started anxious in-
quiries about the missing man.
The result left me wondering
what there is in dreams or in
trying to dodge what they
threaten. My mate had reached
Poperinglie in safety. There
he had got into a brawl and
been skewered with a jack-knife
by a Tommy soldier.

“Percy Pawnticket”: There
is one Sydney family at least in
which running away from home
is hereditary. The other day
a 15-year-old hopeful dis-
appeared without taking formal
leave of anyone, and was next
discovered installed in a city
job and a suburban boarding-
house. But no compulsion to
return was exercised on him,
dad explaining that any . at-
tempt to force him back into
the domestic fold might have
the consequence it had produced
with an elder son, who, after
being retrieved on the first occa-
sion, promptly ran away to sea.
Dad knew the wanderlust him-
self ; at 16 lie had bolted from
Melbourne to Sydney. And
grandpa, who is still a hale
youth, had hit out for the gold-
fields when he was 14. His
father, the first of the adven-
turous tribe to reach Australia, had been
a runaway schoolboy who stowed away on
a ship and was given a job as cabin-boy when
he was discovered.

“Drayman”: There is weeping and gnasli-
ing of teeth in Hobart; for the Government
has cut its grants-in-aid to the bone, if not
to the marrow. The Library Board, which
has been lately doing wonders with its limited
resources in the way of extending the refer-
ence and circulating library facilities to
children and young students, finds itself
blighted by the sudden curtailment of the
subsidy (only £750 a year). The Board
has just taken delivery of the splendid W ll-
Ham Walker collection of Australian and
Tasmanian books and documents, some of
them priceless. As a gift of this size cannot
well be left out in the weather, or even
in the woodshed or the cellar, there is new
housing to be constructed, and apparently
the library trustees (mostly University men
with high brows or aldermen with lower
chests, all very unused to manual toil) will

have to organise themselves into a working
bee and blackleg on the carpenters’ unic*;
in order to erect the necessary shelving. Any-
way, they are pledged to properly stable
William Walker’s fine gift to liis satisfac-
tion, else they’ll lose it. And as there is no
money available for the redemption of the
pledge in the ordinary way, and as there is
not one of the trustees but would just about
commit murder rather than lose the unique
windfall, it looks as though anything might
happen at almost any moment. Elsewhere
things are happening; and there is even a
dreadfully disloyal proposal to convert Gov-
ernment House stables into workmen’s cot-
tages to rent at something like £250 a year.
“D.F.”: Melbourne was called Bearbrass
for a while, Wellington (M.L.) began life
as Britannia, and the first settlement on
the Brisbane River was named Edenglassie.
In the same way Sydney had a narrow
escape from being christened Albion. Sur-
geon White, who came with Phillip, states
that the Governor had intended to name the
settlement Albion on the first King’s birth-
day that he celebrated in Australia. But
before that happened everyone took to call-
ing the settlement Sydney, after the Cove,
and he let it go at that.
“Casual Burglar’s Laborer”:
The persistent press-booming of
the arrival of people of consequence
“in connection with the North
Shore Bridge” could hardly have
escaped the spieling fraternity.
The result is that flash-looking per-
sons, of agreeable and ingratiating
manners, are to be found in a score
of Sydney bars confiding to new
acquaintances over drinks that they
are here “in connection with the
bridge.” The bridge, in fact, has
quite displaced cotton and oil as
a reason for the presence of a num-
ber of engaging and opulent stran-
gers temporarily short of a few
pounds. It might appear to the
average citizen that anyone would
have grave doubts regarding the
bona fides of a man who said he was
in Sydney about a bridge costing a
few millions, yet seemed to have no-
thing better to do than hang casu-
ally about bars and endeavor to tap
new-found friends for loans or take
them down by “con.” games, but
this would be a mistaken idea. A
flat the other day cashed a cheque
for £5O for an alleged bridge-
builder whom he had only met in
the morning, and of whose re-
sources he knew nothing except
that the hawk had paid for two rounds of
drinks.

“Spare Corp” : Of the 25,022 incapacitated
Diggers who are drawing pensions in N. S.
Wales, 1102 have lost one or more limbs.
Just under 800 of these have lost legs or
portions thereof; an even larger proportion
of the 10,166 whose injuries did not result
in amputations are suffering from leg
wounds. The number of A.I.F. men who
wore to be seen limping on crutches in Eng-
land was a subject of frequent comment —
evidence of the strenuous part our men
played in raids and other excursions over
No Man’s Land, where the bullets sang low.
There are 115 definite mental cases, and 292
near the edge; and overstrained hearts earn
1771 pensions. Amongst unusual disabili-
ties is that of a man who suffers from corns
on the soles of his feet. It was not thought
his complaint—which was not viewed very
seriously by the doctors who passed him -
would make him unfit for service; but hard
boots and rough marching with the pack
up aggravated his condition until he was un-
able to stand. Nothing but temporary reliei
has ever been effected by treatment. Repat.
in one of its worst moods repudiated respon-
sibility, on the ground that the incapacity
was not due to war service; but it had the
grace to recede from this attitude.

“Howitzer”: He was a mild albino-type
laddie of 20, the butt of the mob on the
troopship. I came across him one morning
looking more dejected than usual, and he
told me, choking down a sob or two in the
process, that his bitterest grievance was
that he must peel spuds in the galley
when he had enlisted to fight. Four years
later, while stretcher-bearing at Passchen-
daele, I was amazed to see a Digger hop
out to No Man’s Land under an appalling
hail of machine-gun fire and lug in two
sorely-wounded pals. He had nearly reached
safety when a murderous burst of fire caught
him. He and the men he had risked his
life for lay there for an hour or so before

being dragged to safety. The rescuer had 17
bullet wounds in his thighs, and both femurs
were fractured. I was giving first aid, when,
to my amazement, he looked hard at me,
and with a wan smile said: “I told you four
years ago I enlisted to fight, didn’t I?” It
was the sobbing albino of the troopship who
disliked peeling spuds. To-day he wears a
D.C.M., and has one trouser-leg empty, and
I’m a proud man to even know him.

“Nimshi”: Paper-money lias many de-
tractors on hygienic grounds, but people with
a superstitious vein might attribute even
more sinister properties to the note loaned
by a Dunwicli (Q.) Benevolent Asylum in-
mate to his cobber the other day. The
borrower, who at once left the institution,
bound for Brisbane on a week’s leave, was
found two days afterwards lying dead at the
foot of a cliff at Sandgate. But the lender
had preceded him to the other shore, having
hacked his jugular vein a few'hours after

“Tarago” : The wounded were not all will-
ing to forget that there was a war on. I
know some British and Huns, lying out to-
gether in No Man’s Land, swapped, water-
bags and so on; but there were others. In
the grey dawn of May 3, 1917, as we
stumbled into our second objective at Bulle-
court, and turned to “close up on the right,”
I saw a huge Hun officer lying in the bottom
of the trench ahead and trying to raise his
automatic to take a pot shot as we
approached. He hadn’t the strength, how-
ever. My mate, a stretcher-bearer, took the
revolver from him and stopped to look at his
injuries. He counted dozens of wounds and
then didn’t get them all. As he painted the
poor devil from head to heel with iodine the
Hun returned the compliment by spitting all
over him.

mate a few months previously, we ran across a
Tommy officer who insisted on shouting champagne
for us, and repeated the performance several times
despite our mild protestations. He also told us that
he was adjutant in a neighboring H.Q., and that he
had a girl in the village. We met the girl later, and
she showed us some of the baubles thrust upon her
by her “officier Anglais.” Six months later I was
at Abbeville when the G.G.O. sent me an order to
attend H.Q. that afternoon. At the subsequent inter-
view he handed me the job of promulgating the result
of a recent court-martial, explaining that, as the
principal actor in the affair was well known to most
of the officers on H.Q., the duties would rest lighter
cn the shoulders of a stranger. He thereupon thrust
a sheaf of papers into my hand and instructed me
to be at a certain depSt camp the following after-
noon. I was told which parts of the sheaf I was
to read out to the officer, who had been found guilty
of the misappropriation of about 10,000 francs. The
sentence of the Court was cashiering and four years*

hard labor; the highest authority had confirmed Hie
cashiering, but had wiped out the other part of the
sentence. Four hundred officers were formed up in
a hollow square when I faced the gathering with
my papers. I believe I was the only Digger present,
but an Enzed one-pipper held the scissors. Presently
the ranks in front broke and the capless outcast was
escorted into the square, where I recognised him as
the dispenser of fizz six months earlier. I read out
the charges, finding and sentence, and just at this
point the document that came next in order got
astray and fell out of my hands, leaving the prisoner
momentarily stunned with the prospect of four years’
“hard.” It was at this stage that the Enzed sub.
came to the rescue. “Cheer up,” he whispered, “the
four-years part is washed out on that bit of paper
they’re diving for.” That bit of news effected a
transformation in the prisoner, so much so that when
the scissors were brought to cut off his stars he held
his arms out as if he was being made instead of
dariined.

The lawyer’s yarn :
It seems a long way from the Roman law to a
’possum skin ; still they can connect sometimes.
Not long ago a chap was charged in a country
police-court with having ’possum skins in his posses-
sion alleged to have been taken in
the close season. The police pro-
duced a child’s coat made of skins.
They were green, and smelt to
Heaven. Of course the Bench
convicted —saw the man, smelt
the coat, listened to the kid. They
popped it on in the way of flue
and costs, and my man appealed
to Quarter Sessions. I was briefed
for the defendant and was at my
wits’ end for some sort of argu-
ment. You remember old Justin-
ian and his “Institutes” —rotten
Latin, entertaining law. The dear
old soul came to my rescue. He
came in under the head of speci-
ficatio, which covers cases of the
working-up of raw material into
a new form. The card to play
seemed to be specificatio. How
could the police produce the ’pos-
sum skins as evidence against me
when they were all cut up and
turned into a coat. See? Fortu-
nately for me, the Judge was a
bit of a student, and all students
love points rather than facts and
equities. I managed to impress
him, having looked up a couple of
cases —pretty ancient —that with
a bit of twisting seemed to sup-
port my contention. And Anally
I convinced him that there were
no ’possum skins before the Court
on which to base a prosecution,
but only a perfectly innocent coat.
Ah, a great institution the law —
we ought all to be proud of it!
“Bromide’s” plea for the “automatist” :
Perhaps another century, hence the Law will recog-
nise that a man may commit felonious acts
while in that curious condition of wakeful uncon-
sciousness following upon an epileptic fit. I speak
with feeling and some knowledge, because I have
had strange experiences of “automatism” during a
period when I suffered from epileptiform seizures.
One night in Melbourne I had a turn in my office in
Collins-street, and my next conscious act was to
open the door in my home at the other end of the
city. What happened in the interim I am never
likely to know. I may have “sauced” a policeman or
picked a pocket. It is certain that I safely negoti-
ated the Elizabeth and Swanston street-crossings at
a very busy hour without mishap, and possibly said
a “Good night” or two to friends passing by, for
the most remarkable feature of this state is the
patient’s seeming normality. Another night I dropped
in Bourke-street when accompanied by my wife, and
she tells me that I carried on a perfectly sensible
conversation with a couple of kindly Diggers who
had picked me up as a shell-shock case. My third
experience was stranger still. On my way to keep
an appointment in Russell-street, I felt an attack
coming on, and, seeing no chance of gaining a place
of seclusion, I started to walk it off. Travelling
at a brisk pace, I remained visually conscious of
everything within range of my right eye, whilst
my left declined to do its duty, and I collided
with two or three people who passed me closely
on that side. All this time I was in a mental haze,
and when I reached Exhibition-street, a block beyond
my objective, I couldn’t remember where Russell-
street was. My own experience has convinced me
that automatism has to be more seriously considered
as a possible defence against criminal charges.
Reasonable will-power, education and habit may have
prevented my putting a blot on my blameless record,
but what of the epileptic case with a congenital
criminal taint? Inferring that his moral responsi-
bility wouldn’t be strong in his highest state of
intelligence, one can readily believe that he might
be guilty of hideous things when the consciousness
loses control. Yet the position with regard to
these unfortunates to-day is that the Law, based
on mediaeval superstitions and mob prejudice, takes
no cognisance of their condition.
And “Wilfrido” drops in with a M.L. case:
An elderly entrant for the Good Luck Stakes has
turned up here in Auckland. He withdrew £lllO
10s. from the bank, dumping the notes on a desk
while he searched for the cover of his bank-book.
A minute later the notes had gone. He made a
song about it to the tellers, and the melody duly
reached the ears of a Sydney merchant, who found
on going through his pockets in Wellington that
he was over £llOO to the good. He immediately
wired the bank, and forwarded the money. What
had happened was that he had noticed the tempting
array lying orphan-like on the desk, and, picking
it up, was making over to the cashier with it when
he felt an epileptic fit coming on. Everything was
forgotten except the necessity for a refuge; so he
made for a friend’s house, where he rested. Then
he changed his clothes and went south in the even-
ing. Later on a newspaper heading made him feel
sick for a moment or two —with the consequences
mentioned.

“Harold Hardupp”: The last tunefully-
inclined drunk seemed to have faded into the
distance when the silence of the night in
our neighborhood was broken by the sharp
slam of a door and a plaintive voice wailing
into the darkness: “All right, then; gimme
me ’at!” No response was audible; _ but
presently the whining voice started a pitiable
recitative about family troubles, mothers-in-
law, burnt sausages and love. “Well, I alius
do bring all me wages ’ome; but ’ow can a
man bring ’is wages ’ome if ’e. ’asn’t got
any?” it said with a sudden passion. “If ’e
says I bin workin’,” the voice Continued,
“Vs a liar! ’E’s a blarsted liar! All right,
then gimme me ’at!” After that there was
more recitative, doleful mention of un-
starched shirts, missing buttons, more
sausages, somebody’s sister, and the life of
a dog. And at intervals the refrain: “All
right, then gimme me ’at!” I was just fall-
ing off, when the whining voice took a new
note of desperate resolution. “Gimme me
’at, then; gimme me ’at an’ I’ll go out to
South ’Ead an’ do meself in,” it threatened.
For the first time another voice cut into the
monologue. “For Gor’s sake, missus, give
’im ’is ’at!” it bellowed.
“Bush-Cat” : Queer accidents? Here’s one
that might have had a ghastly sequel but
for an S.M.’s presence of mind. Oui bi-
weekly train was due; tradesmen s carts and
carriers’ trolleys were backed into the plat
form, and the usual sprinkling ot idlers
lounged around, while a little way down the
line some boys were playing. \Y hen the trai
appeared, whistling for the signals, the sta-
tionmaster stepped out, gave the all-cleai,
and threw over the point switch. As be a
so one of the kids along the line who had been
sitting on the rails began to shout and tian-
tically wave his arms and legs, whilst a com-
panion made a good attempt to reach the
station in even time. Taking m the situa-
tion at a glance, the s.m. made a grab at
the switch and threw the points open again,
setting the hapless youngster free. He had
been sitting on the railway points when they
closed and trapped him like a vice.

“The Deacon”: The “echo from Mount
Rennie” (B. 31/l/’24) recalls the strenuous
efforts of a Sister of Charity attached to St.
Vincent’s, Sydney, on flehalf of the con-
demned boys. It was largely her own per-
sonal appeals to Carrington that effected the
eleventh-hour reprieve of two of the lads.
She might have done more, but, as
pointed out in the par., a section ot the
community was clamorous for blood, ana
this naturally had its influence on the new
Governor. That there, was actual blood-
letting after the ghastly bungle of the exe-
cutions is known to some. The present Jx.C.
Vicar-General, Monsignor Coonan, was one
of the chaplains, and was present at the sub-
sequent efforts of Nosey Bob to retrieve Ins
previous inefficiency, The executioner actu-
ally opened the veins of the neck m the
case of some of the strangling youths, using
his penknife for the purpose.
“F.A.” : “Ex-Dig.’s” account of the frater-
nising between Tommies and the Huns re-
calls that on Christmas Day, 1914, a well-
known Tommy regiment with a county name
was pulled out of the line in disgrace be-
cause some men had gone across No Mans
Land and exchanged the compliments of the
season with the Saxons opposite. Although
only one company was involved, the whole

regiment was returned to England, and the
colonel and other officers were denied senior-
ity during the period of the war. This action
on the part of the War Office undoubtedly
acted as a deterrent to those who had sub-
sequent opportunities for amicable cessa-
tions of hostilities. The personnel of the
regiment was diffused throughout the tram-
ing-camps of the U.K., but as far as I know
neither men nor officers were sent across the
Channel again.

“Paris and London designers have agreed that
skirts must be shorter. This is probably the first
occasion on which fashion has bowed before universal
obstinacy.’ ’ —Cab le.
In the days (they’re only recent)
When an ankle was indecent,
And, ’gainst Sin alert,
Wowsers thought it very shocking
Did they see a gleam of stocking
Showing ’neath a skirt ;
Girls, expected to be modest,
Tightly laced and straightly bodiced,
Covered neck to toe,
Not a limb would dare uncover,
Howe’er any nature-lover
Sought a beauty show.
Then the rule of Madame Fashion
Was supreme, the ruling passion
Serving her decree.
Now it’s man who rings the changes,
Seeking out (the doctrine strange is)
Modes more good to see.
Since we know that girls look smarter
When they show a flash of garter,
Ends the old Dame’s rule.
What? She said skirts must be longer?
Pooh ! and pah ! and words much stronger—
Fashion, you’re a fool!

You Obtain the Benefits of Co-operation when Assuring with the P. 8 C.
rtrtg
O one knows more fully than the man on the
land the benefits of co-operative dealing.
His own co-operative bodies include the
* most reputable and substantial members of
the community. The same principle of “mutual
benefit” is the basis of the P. &C. This company is
associated with the most important co-operative
bodies in each State, and has thereby obtained their
support and confidence, and the hall-mark of their
approval. The remarkable progress of the Com-
pany is undoubtedly due to the fair dealing and
generous terms the co-operative principle permits,
and to the progressive aims and sound financial
policy of the management.

Britain has had 11 Prime Ministers in the
past half-century; and Scotland has contri-
buted five of them. Ramsay Macdonald's pre-
decessors fromHaggisland were Rosebery. Bal-
four. Campbell Bannerman and Bonar Law;
the last was none
the less Scottish
for having been
born in Canada.
Of the other half-
dozen Beaconsfield
was a Jew whose
family had been
settled in England
for only two or
three generations,
and Lloyd George
is a Taffy. This
leaves only four
who can be listed
as English—-Glad-
stone, Salisbury
Asquith and Bald-
win ; and Glad-
stone was really
more Scot than
English in the
matter of ancestry.
J. W. PENNING-
TON, M.L.A. for

off to England to

at the Empire
Exhibition; he is

Vic. Committee.
“A.R.W.”: General Sir Nevill Maskelyne
Smyth, V.C., of the Imperial Army, now
tripping through Melbourne, deserves well
of Australia. Most 2nd Divvy Diggers re-
member him as their commander at Pozieres,
Rullecourt, Ypres and many another hard
fight. Smyth and his A.D.C. (tennis-player
Pat O’Hara Wood) won’t forget in a hurry
their night reconnaisances at Westhoek Ridge
in 1917, and how nearly done in they were
on one occasion by the time they found
shelter in the pillbox headquarters of the
22nd Battalion. leather quiet and reserved,
Smyth is a fine hors email and big-game shot.
His V.C. and severe wounds came to him in
the Soudan in 189 U. He intends to spend
most of his leave with Queensland friends.
Of the 27 ex-Premiers of S. Aus. only four
are living—Dr. Cock burn, who has resided in
the Cold Country since 1898, and Speaker
“Dick” Butler, each in his 74tli year; Jack
Verran, who is 67 ; and Crawford Vaughan,
not yet 50. Butler is the only one of the
quartette in Parliament, and is seeking re-
election to a seat he has held continuously
since 1890; but Dir. Basedow, the geologist,
is likely to make the running warm for all
three of Barossa’s fitting members.
When William “Timmy” Ellis, of Bendigo,
was 10 he carted drills 120 fathoms down
a tin-mine in Corßiwall. When he was 70
he used a hand rock-drill in the Koch’s
Pioneer mine at Bendigo. When he was 90,
the other day, he wished he was still able
to be mining, and declared he would have
been younger if he had worked at it longer.
He saw mining at
its best at Ben-
digo, Ballarat and
Beechwortli, and in
the days of the
diggings was cham-
pion wrestler of
the Bendigo field.
His most success-
ful win was when
he threw Sam
Pearce, a M.L.
champion; his
most expensive
when he threw a
Chinaman puddler
into the Bendigo
Creek. That cost
him a night in the
cells and a fine of
£l5.

“Macquarie Street’s” post-mortem :
The long-expected and inevitable has happened in
ex-President Wilson’s caiseL Exhausted by grave
disability in the shape of paralysis of the left arm
and leg, a legacy from his tragic breakdown in 1920,
he succumbed after a few days’ illness to gastritis,
which made its appearance in an apparently benevo-
lent form. The wonder is that the ex-President
got on so well for so long-, burdened as he must
have been by high blood pressure and probably
renal mischief. Latterly he has been able to walk
tolerably well, has made speeches and busied him-
seli with legal work, but he has never felt well
enough to appear at akiy State function, however
important. His doctors took care that he did not
get any unnecessary worry. He distrusted his ability
to walk properly at night, and when he visited the
theatre, which was rarely, he invariably had the
services of two attendants to assist him to and from
his car. Ever since his “stroke” his tissues have
been on the down grade* so that a fatal ending
from a gastric attack would occasion litfle surprise;
the patient’s feeble resisting power being over-
whelmed by the accompanying toxaemia.
This being leap-year. Justice Duffy (High
Court) will have a biirthday. The Judge
will be 72 on the 29tla.
Australian industry ought to throw rose-
mary on the grave of J. P. Franki, for a
whole generation manager of Mort’s Dock,
Sydney. He belonged to the old school of
captains of industry, and the labor troubles
of the last few years were things he never
could understand —he was really too simple-
minded for the struggle - in which the mana-
ger of a great labor-empiloying enterprise has
to engage nowadays, and he was personally
all the more likeable on that account. Mr.
Franki was a Swiss, but he was brought to
Sydney as a small boy, learned the engineer-
ing trade with P. N. Russell, worked on Aus-
tralia’s first iron-smelting furnaces at Mit-
tagong—that was 60 years ago—and had
been manager of Mort’s Dock from the day
it was taken over from Thos. McArthur and
Co.
Colonel Wedgwood, of the pottery family
and now Chancellor of the Duchy of Lan-
caster in Ramsay Macdonald’s Ministry, did
not join the Labor Party until 1919; and
it seems likely that his earnest talks with
A.I.F. men had a good deal to do with it.
He was keen on the Diggers, and always
seemed glad to fraternise with them —an
earnest, inquisitive man, with an enthusi-
asm for the belief that a new England was
going to arise out of the war. Many of
the Australians spoke of the Labor party as
the one which had accomplished most back
home; and one of them, now in Sydney,
remembers Wedgwood declaring, as if he
had made a discovery, that it was pnly
through the Labor party that society could
be reconstructed on the lines of his happy
vision. He has done some good work for the
party since joining up, and being an unusu-
ally fine speaker lias been sent to America
more than once to explain matters which it
was well Uncle Sam should know.
Died at 61, J. E. Earwaker, one of Bris-
bane’s best-known sports. He came to
Bauanaland in ’B2, managed Winchcombe-
Carson’s for many years, and was President
of the Woolbuyers’ Association. “J.E.” was
connected closely with the Q.T.C. and was
official starter for many years. He owned
several racehorses, including the well-known
Lawnmower, winner of the Derby and Cup
in 1921.
February 11 will be the centenary of the
consecration of St. James’s, Sydney. Of
course, Sam Marsden, the strenuous old
blacksmith-parson, had something to do with
this church : he preached the opening sermon
in it 18 months before it was finished and
consecrated, lie had got his own first church
up at Parramatta in 1796, and lie opened
St. John’s there on April 10, 1803. St.
Philip’s, of course, was earlier: the founda-
tion-stone of the first St. Philip's was laid
in July, 1793. T. 11. Scott, the first arch-
deacon, who made St:. James's his head-
quarters, had been a wine-merchant. And he
was still a good enough business man to get
£2OOO a year for his new job.
“C. Coral” : After about 40 years in Torres
Strait, chiefly at Murray Island, J. S. Bruce
has retired from the job of Government
teacher and superintendent of the reserve,
and goes south to spend his remaining years.
(He is already over the three score and ten.)
There was much sincere wailing among the
islanders the day he left. During his time
there he has been father, magistrate, doctor
and all sorts of other things to the popula-
tion, and has seen a large community emerge
from the Stone Age and lap up civilisation
until it is now pretty well advanced. In
the cause of science, too, he will be missed.
.Tack Bruce has given much valuable know-
ledge to the world about the interesting
people of the Strait, though his modesty has
so far stayed him from recording his memoirs
or publishing notes of the early days.
“Yoyang” : A short time ago a Bulletin
writer said that Elizabeth Iluon, born at
Parramatta, June 6, 1797. and ancestress of
the Mitchells, of Table Top, was the first
free-born Australian woman. As that was
nine years after the arrival of the First
Fleet, which brought several “free” couples,
it did not seem likely to be true. Volume
11. of “The Historical Records of N. S.
Wales” says the following girl babies were
born among the military and free people in
1795: Ann Jamieson, Sarah Case, Eliza-
beth Hortle, Hannah Gilbert, Mary Smith,
Elizabeth Benson, Mary Macarthur, Jane
Wood, Mary Morrison, Mary Ivory and
Elizabeth Bray. All these have Elizabeth
lluon-Mitchell beaten by two years. And
certainly other girl babies would have been
born in previous years.
John Cameron, who left Australia to go
war-corresponding in Britain’s tiff with the
Boers, later ran the Mentone and Monte
Carlo News, then joined the diplomatic ser-
vice and became consul iti one of the unpro-
nounceable States in Central Europe, has now
been appointed Consul at Detroit, Michigan
(U.S.A.). tie sighs with relief over the
change from 14 languages and dialects to one,
and that one the tongue, or thereabouts, he
learned in Australia. His son, now turned
21, is following in dad’s diplomatic tracks,
and has just been up for his consular exami-
nation. The youngster speaks six languages
—his latest acquisition being Russian —as
well as having a collegiate knowledge of
Greek and Latin. Cameron the elder has
always kept in close touch with his home-
land, and still sends donations to the annual
picnic at Downside, near Wagga (N.S.W.),
where he first went continuously to school.
“Kowsara”: Eliah Vallis, the pioneer of
Boulia (Q.) and the earliest settler on the
Burke River, is still alive and well at Rock-
hampton. Although the Barkly Tableland
was occupied between 1865 and 1868,
none of the early pioneers seem to have fol-
lowed further down the river than Roxburgh.
There in 1875 Vallis found the remains of
old fencing-posts. He also found the Burke
River, striking it first where Boulia now
stands. His partner was R. Donaldson, who
in 1885 and for several years afterwards
represented Tumut in the N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly. Believing he had struck a new
river, Vallis named it the Donaldson. Later
the pair went to Blackall and took up the
Bullyo-Bullyo run, the first of the pastoral
pioneers in this district.
Rev. Mother Mary de Paul, who has been
in St. Ignatius’s Convent of Mercy, Welling-
ton (N.S.W.), for 37 years, celebrated her
golden jubilee as a nun the other day. She
entered Bathurst Convent in 1871 when she
was 21, and three years later was professed.
The venerable lady, who is a native of Gos-
forth, in the Maitland (N.S.W.) district, and
is the first Australian native to celebrate
such a jubilee, has been snowed under a
pile of congratulations from all the States.
A notable figure will be removed from Vic.
Uppah Chambah when Walter Manifold goes
out at the end of the month. He threw
up the Presidency in August, just in time
for Frank Clarke to snap it when the first
Lawson Government was on its last legs.
WALTER MANIFOLD, for years President
of the Vie. Leg. Council, who through
ill-health has now retired from public
life.
Not liking to be a mere passenger, as lie
might become in his very uncertain state of
health, Manifold is making way for a physi-
cally sounder man. Magnificent McColl, the
Clerk, and Fine-Mannered Manifold go
out together. The place will be like a sub-
urban council soon.
“Iford” : I retain a faint recollection of
the Ramsay Macdonald who flitted about
Australia in 1906; perhaps the most impres-
sive thing about him was the assertive red
of his necktie. But I suggest The Bulletin
par. (31/l/’24) crediting Britain’s present
Prime Minister with being the first of his
line to have visited the Commonwealth “bar
Lord Salisbury” has left another lord —
Rosebery—out of account.’ The pink-and-
wliite earl of other days was here in the
’seventies or thenabouts, before he started
seriously on his career of statesmanship and
Derby-winning.
In was in 1922 that the first medal in con-
nection with the Chair of Architecture at
Sydney Uni. was awarded, the winner being
Will R. Laurie. Since then William has
been endeavoring to annex further knowledge
in the Cold Country. He did a grind in
Glasgow for a few months, and there heard
of a £lOO scholarship awaiting a claimant.
He butted in, but the adjudicators decided
that no entry was of sufficient merit, though
they consoled the Australian with a pat on
the back and the highest marks. Now he is
in London studying with Herbert Baker,
A.R.A., F.R.1.8.A. There should be some-
thing doing here, for, among other things,
Baker is remodelling the Bank of England.
The Australian Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy has elected H. W. Gepp its pre-
sident for 1924. The election is an honor
to the Institute as well as to the man.
Coming from the De Bavay Co.’s service at
Broken Hill, Gepp organised the Electrolytic
Zinc Co.’s works at Risdon (Tas.), and
made it the second largest producer of spelter
in the world. He takes, besides, a wide
interest in industry in its national bearing,
is a strong believer in co-operation and wel-
fare work, and has got on so well with labor
in his own industry that strikes have been
hardly heard of. There are, incidentally,
about 1200 employees at Risdon.
Father Frank McEvoy, the new vice-
rector of St. John’s, within Sydney Univer-
sity, once drove a pen in the N.S.W.
Registrar-General’s Dept.
Henry Lawson’s son, Jim, has grown tired
of working for the Government. After
graduation at the Ilawkesbury (N.S.W.)
Agricultural College, he was given charge
of the agricultural class at the Casino Rural
School; but he thinks he sees a larger future
outside the Department.
The Torres Strait islanders are beginning
to acquire Royal Humane Society medals.
During the big cyclone off Cape Melville some
years ago, when about 300 colored and white
people were drowned and many boats lost, a
woman named Moira, of Darnley Island, who
succeeded in rescuing a couple of men, was
subsequently handed a silver decoration for
her bravery. A few months back a young
lad named Jacob, from the same island,
jumped overboard from a pearling lugger in
the height of a heavy blow to assist a com-
rade who had been knocked over by the flying
boom. He accomplished his object, and the
Society has now handed him its silver medal
with a certificate. Jacob doesn’t know whether
to hang his trophies on the cocoanut-leaf wall
or stow them away in his camphor-wood
“bokis,” but he is very proud of them, all the
same.
THE BUSINESS OF PATRIOTISM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A meeting of creditors of Howard Houlder, sen.,
formerly a wealthy shipowner and shipbroker, was
held to-day. A statement showed that Mr. Houlder
in 1920 was worth £400,000, and that he responded
to a call to help forward the patriotic work of
reconstruction necessitated by the war. The result
was that he now owed about £105,800. The assets
were estimated at about an equal amount.” — Cable.
The more than painful case of Howard Houlder
calls to mind
The patriotic record of my friend Sir Hiram
Plunk—
A man who, while not wholly to self-interest deaf
or blind,
Had at the clear Pierian spring of Duty deeply
drunk.
The Armistice arrived to find him worth a million
clear,
All garnered in the war years. “Don’t ask how,’
he used to smile;
“There’s certain things a man’s best friend should
never want to hear,
“And one of them’s the way in which yours
truly made his pile.”
An urgent call for help went up: the cry was
“Reconstruct!”
And Hirlim, now a K.8.E., came quickly to the
fore;
While others at the fleeing skirts of Fortune vainly
plucked,
Plunk grabbed the garment, and emerged worth
half a million more.
The further Reconstruction went the deeper Houlder
fell;
Sir Hiram, on the contrary, rose higher day by
day.
The knight not only served the State, lie served
himself as well,
While Howard Houlder’s name and fame fell
fainting by the way.
There could be but one end to this, you, reader,
must agree;
A grateful nation said that Plunk had earned a
Viscount’s style:
The Herald’s Office filed the title straight for all
to see—
His schedule was the only thing that Houlder
had to file.

“E.V.R.” : “Jobber’s” yarn (B. 10/l/’24)
about the marksman who put a bullet through
piggy’s wild heart while that porcine charger was
dashing scrub-wards witn an unexpected rider en-
genders honest doubts. Not that the thing is im-
possible, for a pig runs pretty straight most times
and is an easy mark for any reasonable shot. But
where was the jockey’s near leg when piggy got
his issue behind the shoulder, and what allowance
did the marksman make for deflection of the bullet
prior to its exit on the far side? If “Jobber”
wants nominations for the Crack-shot Stakes, 1
don’t mind putting him in touch with the relatives
of a one-time cobber —lie’s still on Gallipoli—with
whom I used to shoot black wallaby in the far
east of Croajingolong (Vic.) back in 1912-13. Our
pvt method was to drive (I did the driving) an old
buckboard through the waist-high bracken, and pot
the agitated black hoppers as they fled before us.
Only head shots were allowed (anything else knocked
something off the price we got for our skins), and
my mate used to reckon four hits out of five was a
passable average. He used an ordinary .32 Win-
chester carbine, and the average range was about
50 to 60 yards. With skins at somewhere about 3s.
a pound we knocked up a very fair cheque.

“Colwyn”: Four years ago wallabies were
to be found by hundreds in the thickly-timbered
hilly country about Pine Ridge and Purnamooti,
20 miles or so from Broken Hill. In those days a
fox in that locality was a rarity. A few weeks ago
my mate and I got as many as 67 foxes there in
seven nights, but no wallabies are now to be seen
within miles. Is the disappearance of tlie wallabies
attributable to the advance of the foxes? The
marsupials have certainly not been shot out.
* * * *
“Talanoa” : Touching “Wingella’s” imiugo-
trees (B. 6/12/’23). My experience—and 1 lived
for 15 years in a house surrounded by trees 40 feet
high—is that a full-grown tree always bears two
crops unless rain falls during the “setting” of the
fruit. Suva, where it is nearly always wet, seldom
sees a mango crop; hut the north (and dry) side
of Yiti Levu has enough to supply the world with
chutney. Can anyone tell me why a horse will only
bite bits out of a mango on the ground? 1 have
seen only one that would pick up the fruit and spit
out the stone. Yet cows swallow the whole outfit
with impunity.
* * * *
“Herodot” : Many residents of Sydney sub-
urbs are cursing the starling because it has intro-
duced lice into their houses. It nests under the
eaves and in various inaccessible places, and before
long the house is infested with vermin. And eradi-
cation is a long and complicated process. A Rand-
wick man who had this unpleasant experience swore
that it would not happen again. So when his house
had been cleansed he affixed small tin cups and
boxes to the parts of the premises where the birds
nested ; and in these receptacles he placed potassium
cyanide in solution, and grain and fruit that had
been prepared with the same stuff. The result was a
large crop of dead starlings; and since then the
feathered pests have given his premises a wide berth,
though they are all over the adjoining houses.
“Wax” : Members of the Council are posi-
iive that an acquired immunity cannot be trans-
mitted. Well, how is this? I acquired immunity
to bee stings by a long and painful process. My
wife is very susceptible, and dare not venture near
the hives. Yet our little girl, aged five, is immune,
having been stung often during the last two years
without pain. What is the explanation?
* * * *
“Hori” : Six miles above Coolullah station,
on the bank of the Leichhardt River, Gulf of Carpen-
taria (Q,), there is a fully-grown gum whose base is
circled by a dray tyre. This tree-bracelet was first
discovered by Charles Ritchie, head stockman on
Coolullah, in 1899. The tree was then
about 30 feet high and 18 inches in
diameter, but an accurate estimate of its
age could not be made, as drought and
bush-fires might have to be allowed for.
Alongside the tree Ritchie discovered iron
fittings of a dray, and 30 yards away
were the axle and wheel boxes. The
metal remains of a pair of old-fashioned
wood and copper hames were also found.
There was not a particle of woodwork,
but white-ants or bush-fires could account
for that. The brothers Power, who
bought Coolullah from Major Collis in
1883, were quite certain when questioned
by Ritchie that the dray must have been
there prior to their arrival, as it could
not have been abandoned so close to the
homestead and the main river crossing
without their hearing of it. Had the
dray broken down at any period subse-
quent to the taking up of Coolullah —-
some time in the ’seventies —the valuable
iron parts would not have been allowed
to remain there, as in those days a
vehicle had to be pretty far gone before
it was given up as a total loss. Local old-timers
cannot advance a reasonable explanation, but many
of them reckon “it might have something to do with
Leichhardt’s disappearance.” I wonder.

“Yarrum” : The best rabbit patch I ever
struck was at Hobby’s Yards (N.S.W.) ; I didn’t
count them, but there were thousands to the acre.
Another bloke and I split open a log 17ft. long, and
got 3 bucks, 7 does and 34 infants. In a smaller
log there were so many that, when they moved, the
splinter rolled. To-day rabbos are as scarce there
as feathers on a flathead. Netting and digging-out
did it.

“Zantlius” : The first mate brought to Syd-
ney came as early as 1805. The half bag of “mata”
found on board the brig Harrington when she
arrived from the west coast of South America, Wil-
liam Campbell master, was obviously South American
tea. Three bags were originally taken on board
the Harrington from the San Francisco and San
Paulo, a Spanish merchant vessel which Campbell
made prize of at Coquimbo.
“McNorth” : The best underwater swimmer
I ever met was Charlie Kiama, a Raratongan, well
known in Melanesia ; he was as much at home under
water as most swimmers are on the surface, and had
astounding powers of endurance. In Gizo (Solo-
mons) I saw him swim from bow to stern under
the keel of the 8.-P. steamer —a truly astonishing
distance —and after a moment’s breather turn over
PROMISE OF PARADISE.
TALKATIVE W IFE: “I suppose, John, when I die you will have a mausoleum built for me?”
LONG-SUFFERING H USBAND: “No, sweet pet—I shall have you cremated, and your ashes
put in an hour-glass, Then you can go on for ever.”
and repeat the performance. Local natives who
tried the same stunt failed badly. In working shell
or beche-de mer he would see out an ordinary man's
two dives. At Moresby on one occasion for a full
two minutes he walked on the bottom in nine feet
with me standing on his shoulders, my head being,
of course, above the surface. In the Trobriands
they called him the Fish Man, and to my know-
ledge his prowess formed the subject of at least
one village dance-song. Incidentally, I once assisted
his wife in a little obstetric matter—Charlie had a,
trading station of sorts in an out-of-the-way part
of the Trobriands at the time, the lady was in
a bad way, I was the only white thereabouts,
and Charlie thought that having a medicine-chest
i must know something about the business —and in
return he produced a pickle-bottle of pearls and
gave me two. Though I didn’t know it at the time,
those pearls had no business to be in his possession,
as he had no license either to buy or to fish for
pearls, and later a police party appeared and made
a search. But Charlie had seen them coming, dropped
the bottle in eight fathoms in the lagoon, and when
the row was over swam down and recovered it.
All this is recalled to me by a letter from the
Trobriands stating that, after all his lung-straining
experiences and 50 years of plain and fancy risks
on the sea floor, Charlie ICiama died recently at the
age of 66 —of measles.
“Adamascus” : It lias always been thought
up north that the artesian and non-artesian areas
in Queensland were divided by a rock formation
which runs north and south through the Drummond
Range, with no water east of the rock. But it looks
now as if that was wrong, for there is a bore in
full flow five miles s.-w. of Springsure, on Burnside
station, which is east of the formation. It is in
a rising paddock at the head of the watershed, and
was sunk through solid rock every inch of the way
to 96ft., where a supply was struck. The site of
the bore was picked by a water diviner, and it is
the only one with an artesian flow, although several
others have been sunk on the same station.

Monaro-girl Ida Dawson, from Patagonia:
1 am waiting to hear whether the Kendall expedi-
tion has found in N.Q. that little-fella pussy-cat
with the bushy tail and the defensive smell which
“Kenbir” suggests *may be a variety of the S.
American skunk.” In which case it will indicate
that Australia and S. America were joined in tne
long ago. As to that, I have obtained, from the
valley of the Chubut, in Southern Patagonia, some
beautiful specimens of fossil leaves, and if they are
not leaves of our Australian eucalyptus, I’ll eat my
hat. At the present time this region carries only
small scrubby “trees,” and these in patches. There
have been several Abo. pars about animals that spit.
Our guanaco certainly does. When angry it walks
slowly towards its victim, without a quiver in its
beautiful limpid eye, its long neck swaying gently
from side to side; then, arrived within stinking
distance, it spits, a regular shower. This is the
tame guanaco. When two fight in the open camp
they twine their long necks together, and once
they get going they spoil your taste for Dempsey
anu Firpo.
“Ellae”: I can corroborate “X2X” (B.
10/1/’24) regarding oyster-shell wounds. I once
cut a big-toe joint on an oyster-shell in Lane Cove
River (N.S.W.). Result, a painful and burning
swelling, which repeated itself at varying intervals
during the next two or three years, when a tiny
fragment of shell worked out. That was about SO
years ago, and not only does the enlarged joint give
me trouble in shoe-fitting still, but the toe itself
often becomes painful.
“Golub” : Many bushmen firmly believe
that the goanna when bitten by a Bnake during a
fig-ht saves its life by eating some herb, which
neutralises the action of the snake-venom ; and de-
tailed and circumstantial stories are told by people
w ho say they have actually seen the ’go nibbling
this plant. Undoubtedly the big lizard is immune
to the effects of snake-poison, but this is due rather
to a physiological characteristic of its blood than to
any spepial herbal knowledge. Research has shown
that, whereas mammalian and reptilian blood is quite
different by reason of certain bodies in the latter
which are absent from the former, the blood of ah
reptiles is practically identical. It is well known
that the snake is protected against its own venom—
the stories of wrigglers committing suicide by biting
themselves are as fallacious as those of the go. and
the herb—and the probabilities are that the goanna
possesses the same protection, which is based on
the molecular arrangement of certain serological
compounds occurring in its blood.

“Nitric” : Thomas Burns, the overland
drover, left Charleville (Q.) on Aug. 20, with
5000 two-tooth wethers and ewes, and delivered them
at Swan Hill (Vic.), 1000 miles away, on Jan. P;
He was five months on the road and did not have
1 per cent, of losses; yet he left Charleville in the
middle of the drought and met no rain till he
reached Wilcannia. I know of only one trip to
equal it—that of Ted Hayes and three other drovers,
who took 1800 head of cattle from Normanton
(N.Q.) to Boonah (Fassifern), a distance of 1400
miles, with a loss of 27 beasts.
TIIE UNBELIEVER.
THE R EREL: “Don’t wanter go to Heaven.
I’ll bet there’s no fun there. If there
was you wouldn’t let me go.”
“Ignat” : Could the Council inform me if
the small green snake, generally to be found among
reeds and in trees, is venomous? I have asked
alleged snake authorities the question many times
and so far the Noes have it—hut the majority h
not large enough to make me close my weather
eye. A while back I saw a cow which was said io
have been bitten by a green snake a few hours
previously. She showed no ill effects of the bite;
but cocky threw her milk away.

THE OATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I’ll play you fair,” young Tony said
To Edwin, hunters both.
He crossed his breast three times. Then Ted
Swore grimly, nothing loath:
“If I prove false, God strike me dead,
Upon my sacred oath!”
Two brothers, lost to shame and ruth,
Once caught in passion’s throes —
Two brothers, friends from early youth—
Had turned to deadly foes.
Yet all they fought about, in truth,
Was Rose, and only Rose.
Rose, Rose was all their care, and still
They struggled more and more;
Each keen to work the other ill—
No other thought they bore.
So life was but a frenzy, till
A deadly oath they swore.
They meant to keep this compact true;
Their feud had ended now.
Only a solemn oath would do
To end this brothers’ row
About the bitter problem who
Should milk the cursed cow.
For months they wrangled, raged and fought,
Then came to savage blows—-
With outraged feelings overwrought,
Or shattered hopes, who knows?
They never could agree who ought
To milk, each morning, Rose.
For dawn of day they had no yearn,
But both those brothers’ heads
V ith deep, strategic thoughts would burn
On two adjacent beds.
Ted knew that it was Tony’s turn,
But Tony knew ’twas Ted’s.
OPEN CONFESSION.
T OMMY: “Was that our window that went, dad?”
D AD: “Yes.”
T OMMY: “Then I rather think it must have been me.”
They marked each morning in a book,
But dates were never l ight;
Their calendars looked queer and crook,
And led to many a fight,
Till, desperate, the brothers took
An oath of deadly might.
“I’ll spit my death,” young Tony said
To Edwin, milkers both,
“If I don’t take my turn.” Then Ted
Spat fiercely, nothing loath,
And both swore: “May God strike me dead
If I should break my oath!”
VICTORIA.

BREWED FROM
PURE MALT
AND HOPS ONLY
“Morob”: The New Guinea native has
some queer ideas concerning the treatment of pets.
In the Morobe and Madang districts of the Mandated
Territories I have seen tamed water-rats w’ith one
oi' more of their legs broken to keep them from going
back to the family. The “cus-cus” is likewise
maimed for the same reason. About the only animals
the Papuan is really kind to are the pig and the
clog, yet even dogs are sometimes the victims of
fiendish cruelty. One I remember was bought by
a native who objected to the size and shape of its
oars. He removed the offending listeners with the
top of a tobacco tin, the feet being lashed together
with rope while the operation was in progress.
“A.B.B”: “Jacky Roo” (B. 27/12/’23)
should keep on using his breastplate, regardless of
public opinion. Having driven mail-coaches for half
a lifetime, I can recommend the breastplate in
preference to tue collar, especially for sulky work.
When driving for Cobb and Co. I always carried a
breastplate ; in nearly every fresh team I yoked there
w T as a horse that worked much better in it than in a
AFTER HIS FIRST SERMON.
MR. BUGG: “ He's got a large vocabulary, hasn’t he?”
MRS. BUGG: “Yes. It’s a wonder he doesn’t take more exercise
and reduce it.”
collar. The breastplate is the cooler and more
comfortable of the two. I have never known a
horse to chafe with one, and that can’t be said of
the collar.
* # * *
“Akran”: After the last great storm liar]
passed over Casino (N.S.W.) there were many dead
fish in the Richmond River for a distance of about
a mile along the stream. Old hands reckon that
the river was struck by lightning. The spectacle
reminded me of the Somme when hungry Diggers
fished for their dinner with Mills-bomba.
“Elbow's Bend”: The ’possum can beat
the cat for clinging to life. Trapping in the Oron-
gorongo (M.L.) last winter, I took a ’pos. out of a
trap after not less than 36 hours’ residence —part of
the time in a freezing blizzard and part in a snow-
storm. He had towed half a hundredweight of birch
anchor and trap 200
yards up an exposed
birch ridge and was
then recuperating for
a further effort. A
.22 through the head
stopped him from de-
camping on a second
pilgrimage. On the
way down he recipro-
cated with mining
operations on a goad
pair of trousers and

attacked strongly with
a manuka waddy. I
left him overnight
hanging in the bottom
of a bag under about
60 pounds of dead
’possum, and by morn-
ing two of his neigh-
bors weren’t worth
skinning. The atten-
tions of a few hundred
blowflies through che
bag and the load of
several thousand eggs
on his back must ha v e
broken his fighting
spirit, but I think I
hoard him laugh as he

Now, praise the Lord, it’s all the other way about.”
bag. A “lumper,”
this chap went 28in. from base of neck to base of
tail —unstretched. How about it ?
“Nugget”: When “Veronal” gets the din-
kum statistics of his devil-infested abos. (B.
17/l/’24) he will find that they recovered in nearly
every case. One of the peculiarities of Binghi s
simple thinking apparatus is its uncanny influence
over his body. He can croak any time he becomes
obsessed with the idea that his death has been de-
creed, but it only requires a reputable abo. Hickson
to straighten the kink out of the patient s mind, by
the application of antidotes of a sufficiently mysteri-
ous nature, to restore him to perfect health. Boiled
herbs and curiously-carved pieces of bone are quite
as effective as the ashes of dead relatives. Some
remarkable cures have resulted from simply hanging
the remedies mentioned about the sufferer’s hut and
telling him he will be O.K. in a day or so. It’s
just another advantage of simple faith over Norman
blood.
“AuVait”: Tell “D.H.V.” (B. 27/12/’23)
that those who prefer the .32 Yankee Winchester
to the .303 M.L.E. for ’roo shooting have never
seen one of the latter weapons. I have a hand in
the working of our rifle club, and requests from
’roo shooters for ,303’s are as numerous as the stars
on a dark night. They are invariably of opinion
that the .32 Winchester, and others of a calibre up
to .38-.44 and .32-.40, are not in the same paddock
as the .303. Fit a .303 with a “telescope” such as
most ’roo shooters attach to their rifles, and up
to 400 yards a ’roo would be as dead as Tutank-
hamen. But a marksman would be doing good
work if he knocked the marsupial at 250 yards with
a .32.
* * * *
“Dingaan”: The hills on the east coast
of the Speck are a
blaze of white blossom
from the flowering
peppermint-gums. A t
Christmas-time, from
the top of Ben Lomond
(the island's highest
mountain), looking
across to the sea over
the foothills about
Avoca, Fingal and St.
Mary’s, the bloom
could be seen for miles.
A miner who accom-
panied me along the
track from Storey's
Creek to Mangani Said
that the trees flowered
only once in five years,
and that this year was
going to be “a snodger
for the bees.” Though
I saw' the flowering
trees all about the
slopes of Ben Lomond,
Mt. Barrow’ and Mt.
Arthur, on the hun-
dred-odd-mile run be-
tween Launceston and
Burnie not a tree in
blossom w r as to be seen.
“Yoyang”: “F.A.” is wrong when he states
(B. 24/1 /’24) that bees were first imported into
Australia by Capt. James Willis, of the ship Isabella.
Those brought out by the Isabella came in 1822.
Twelve years before that Parson Marsden, of Parra-
matta, returning to Australia in the Ann, landed
two hives of bees. Samuel Marsden was a great
pioneer and introduced many things to this country.
Whether he was the first to introduce bees I cannot
say, but his hives were certainly here 12 years before
the Isabella’s lot.
“Baro”: When I used the term “swaggie”
I did not mean “Nannangoat’s” (B. 22/11/’23)
Murrumbidgee whaler, whose only assets ai e i ags,
bags and an odor of sanctity, but the toiler who
humps his drum or bikes it between jobs, and, the
fossicker or prospector who indifferently humps it,
bikes it or “barrows” it. These latter carry dishes.
Anyhow, the bagman with sufficient nous always
carries a frying-pan, the capacity of this being
increased by placing it upon two pieces of stone or
wood when used for damper-making. As for dripping
being carried by a swaggie, even as I write one
of the elan is asking the cook to fill a small tin
for him —a common request. And if dripping, why
not butter? I always carried the canned variety
when the weather was favorable. The statement that
mulga is no good for making coals is absurd. Large
belts of timber in Australia, save for an occasional
kurrajong, consist of nothing else. I had two years’
experience of mulga as the sole fuel, and never
heard any complaints. Generally speaking, any
timber will do to make a damper, since almost any
sort will produce a heap of red coals; and that is
all that is required, one heap being approximately
as hot as another. When the dough is covered with
the coals, they are "blinded” or “smothered” with
white ashes (for preference), earth or sand. Com-
bustion then ceases, and the cooking is completed by
the retained heat. As the damper rises, cracks will
appear on the surface of the moan 1. These should
be gently obliterated. About 20 minutes after it
has risen, which will be known by the cracks ceasing
to appear, it is done. “Jimmy Possum” (B. 3/l/’24)
seems to have missed the purport of my par., which
was a gentle protest against the practice of calling
everything in the flour-and-water line a johnnic-
cake. Why not call a flap-jack a johnnie? It is
at least damper.
“Billy Brolga”: I have studied bush
meteorology closeiy, but I can’t say I have noticed
the change in the color of foliage mentioned by
“Moe” (B. 13/12/23). Probably such plants c.r
shrubs as subsist mainly on atmospheric plant food
would be affected to a certain extent at the approach
of rain; but any change that might take place in
the color, etc., of foliage, would hardly be notice-
able. After a prolonged dry spell many plants
will not noticeably respond for several hours to as
much as an inch oi rain. Most grasses, on the other
hand, will brighten up a few minutes after a service-
able downpour.
“Nugget”: Tell “Wink” (B. 10/l/’24)
that home-seeking snakes do not build their own
domiciles, but wriggle into ready-made ones. Break-
fast is frequently provided by the original owners.
The wriggler is easily satisfied; it will rear a family
in anything from a mouse nest to a rabbit burrow.
In the Hunter River districts (N.S.W.) the favored
type of residence appears to be the kingfisher’s
nest. It has a decent-sized chamber, properly lined
at the inner extremity of the tunnel, and cultivation
paddocks run right to the water’s edge, providing
an endless supply of the choicest varieties of frog
and mouse.

“E.S.S.”: In all towris, at all times,
Black Brother’s home was alongside a fire. He had
no records of the ancient notable who first lit up
the darkness and regaled his compeers with roast
’possum. But old Pom Pom, a leng-dead wise man
of Unumgar, related that two crossed dead limbs
had rubbed together in a summer wind until they
smoked, and subsequently some observant blacks
amused themselves by rubbing sticks together 1 o
make them smoke, and unexpectedly produced a
blaze. The miracle astonished them. It caught the
grass, and galloped like a thousand furies through
the bush, destroying their camp, ’possum-rugs and
weapons, and chased the population into scrubs and
waterholes. It was a terrifying spirit that leaped
in anger out of sticks, and rushed and crackled in
mad fury alter all creation. After a long while
they came forth to gaze with stupefied awe at the
blackened bush, at smoking stumps and logs, and
blazing trees. They were cold and hungry, and when
they moved up to examine a smouldering log thev
discovered that it was delightfully warm. 4round
were roasted bandicoots, rat-kangaroos and quail,
all smelling good. Dogs began to eat them, and
by-and-bye the oldest gin was elected taster—and
she ate a whole bandicoot. Then they gathered up
the charred carcases, and by the burning log enjoyed
the first great feast of roasted meat. After all,
the fire was the sun’s brother. It slept in dry wood
and in the flint stones, from which it sprang in
tiny sparks that grew and grew and ran amok like
Hell. Wonderful was Wyburra, the fire. But they
could wake it when they wished, and control it to
their will. Great was Bi-gal, the black man.
Thence the cherished glow became his mainstay, and
the everlasting symbol of home.
“Te Pana” : Hori is objecting to pakeha
school-teachers trotting out Maori children to perform
the haka for any chance visitor who happens along to
the pa. Particularly is this the case in such show
spots as Rotorua and the Wanganui River, where the
school time-table is always liable to be upset for
the benefit of Cook’s tourists. I once conducted a
Maori school north of Auckland, and for three months
in the year my chief job was “producer” of haka
and poi <1 nces. However, I turned the show to
•good account by sending Henare around with a hat,
and devoting tne proceeds to the purchase of books
for the school library.

“Riverina”: Four M.L. macliine-sbearers
got through a notable day’s work at Mount Zion.
Okoia. The tally-board read: Skinner 830, Taskw
323, Wilson 317, McNamara —who worked only por-
tion of the day—208. M.L. sheep are, as a rule,
easier to shear than Australian jumbucks, but
Skinner and the others are entitled to the rank ot
“gun.”
“Cartot”: Although malaria is generally
supposed to be indigenous to New Guinea and the
Bismarck Archipelago, as well as the Solomons
group, there is evidence that it has not existed
very long in those parts and that it is a legacy
from the white man, like tuberculosis and syphihs.
Had the natives been exposed to lifelong infection
for countless generations, one would expect them to
have become immune. Instead of that, the disease
is playing havoc with them. In some ways the
native suffers more than the white man. None nf
the explorers who visited New Guinea in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries have left any suggestion
that malaria then existed, although their accounts
of the islanders are often copiousness itself. Maybe
the thing was introduced, either directly or from
adjoining islands, in the latter part of the eighteen!"!!
century, the carriers being European sailors win;
had caught it in Africa or South America, or even
in the Mediterranean, where it was once prevalent.
Malaria did not trouble the armies of Cortes and
Pizarro, which suggests that it didn’t arrive in
South America till the beginning of the seventeen.li
century.

postponed the slaughter. Six weeks later, barring

“Pat Bushie” : Out back, mutton is always
available in butchers’ shops, even when sheep are
scarce —a fact not unconnected with the numerous
goats which wander round the western tbwns and
villages. It is hard to distinguish between the
two, so the butcher finds it easy to sell goat is
mutton. The main difference, and an unfailing one
by which a classification of the carcase can be made,
is in the fat. Mutton fat is solid, while that of the
sroat has a stringy appearance.
MY OPEN ROADS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It runs due north, the open road,
Along it I go swinging;
My swag is very little load,
With all the bush birds singing.
And far from all the city rows
My bed of leaves I’m heaping;
I see the stars shine through the boughs
And ’possums shyly peeping.
Some roads branch off to east and west—
I don’t care which I’m taking.
They all are good, I know no best;
To no place am I making.
Keep all your cities if they suit,
Your motors, trams and ’buses ;
Give me the open road —per boot —
Where no one fumes ok fusses!
Sometimes my open road runs south
Through fern-fringed creeks and mountains
Where no one yet has seen a drought—
Each gully has its fountains —-
And where the wild clematis creeps
Through maiden-hair and bracken,
Till by a creek that never sleeps
Awhile my footsteps slacken.
I work whene’er I feel inclined—
Sometimes a bit of shearing—
And for a winter job 1 find
Some fencing or some clearing;
But, oh, I love the old blue swag,
The roads round hillsides bending!
There’s not one day my spirits flag,
My fortunes need no mending.
The plain-lands skirt the open road;
I pass by creeks and ridges.
No master there your life can goad
When you have burned your bridges.
Away from all the madding crowd
The long red tracks go winding
To v’here the bush calls long and loud,
“Here’s happiness worth finding! ”
And when, beyond my last mile-post,
Up Golden Stairs I’m tramping,
I’ll find some dinkum bagman's ghost
Outside the fences camping;
If Peter says “You cannot come
Among the angel ladies,”
Then I’ll rehoist my tattered drum,
And turn and tramp to Hades!

Brilliant young Prof. John Hunter, whose
research work in anatomy made him an
assistant professor at an age when most
young doctors are only half-w r ay through
their studies, has joined the ranks of the
married. He did not do this without pro-
vocation, however, as anyone will tell you
who knows his bride. Hazel McPherson, of
Ashfield. (She trained for the nursing pro-
fession at Prince Alfred’s.) The Congrega-
tional Church at Summer Hill was the scene
of the wedding, and the bride swathed herself
in ivory georgettes and old lace. Afterwards
the bride’s mother and father entertained
the wedding party at their home, Fairmount,
Ashfield.
Dorothy Howell-Price, of Summer Hill,
stepped up St. Andrew’s aisle last week to
the Voice that Breathed. Wrapped in silver
brocade drawing a wash of frilly geor-
gette train, she murmured from a mist of
tulle veiling the vows that made her one witli
Keith Bcntzen. The groom, neat but not
gaudy, handed over the ring with the usual
undertakings -as to board and lodging. His
brothers Victor and Thorwald supported him,
while i Dorothy had the backing of three
pretty maids whose frocking was in prim-
rose, leaf-green and Alice blue respectively.
Saturday afternoon brought a job to
Canon Bellingham, of St. Philip’s, when he
was called upon to make a bouquet of Ethel
Irene Hawthorne, of Highfield, Carcoar, bud
of the medical Hawthornes, and Mervyn
Gray Ormiston, a Macquarie-street guin-
pacifist. One of the bridesmaids came from
Wangala, and another small one from Dalby
(Q.), while the best man was from Gunne-
rtah. The honeymoon is being spent in Mel-
bourne. The healths were drunk at the
Carlton.
Another reception at the Carlton followed
the knot-tying of Laura Hingst, of New-
castle, and Dr. William Cotter H arvey,
well known as a member of the Prince Alfred
staff, a id as the son of Manly’s Dr. Har-
vey. who some years ago took his stethoscope
to Leura. Laura chose shell-pink georgettes
for her wedding attire, and weighted them
with embroideries of crystal beads. Sister
Ida, in ivory lace, and bride’s niece Dorothv
supported her, while medicine-man Macar-
thur Sheppard attended to the groom’s acces-
sories. Mrs. Stobo, another of the bride’s
sisters, hostessed the felicitations.
The Anglican Church at Lake Bathurst
staged a pretty wedding last week when
Eileen Shoemark, of that district, became
Mrs. Theo Croft, of North Sydney. The
bride’s ivory frothings of satin and seed
pearls were attended by sister Ruth in a
souffle of pale blue and silver. The cake
was cut and distributed to a strictly family
gathering at the home of the bride’s parents.
Deewhy. where the artists come from,
married off Lawrence Failes, son of the local
doctor, the other night. Marie Phyllis
Woodhill, of Northbridge. was the bride; and
St. Stephen’s housed the ceremony. The
newly-married pair make their home at
Coonabarabran.
Among the 500 who will sample the 20,000-
ton Mooltan on her first voyage from Australia
(she leaves Sydney at the end of the month)
will be the Mcßobert family—mother and
daughters Margaret and Helen. They un-
packed only a year ago; but Margaret has
given David Williams a promise to make
Liverpool a brighter place—and incidentally
mairy him. Brother John —of the Robert
Harper firm—will follow with his wife in a
couple of months to be at the wedding.
Mrs. Tony Hordern is going to be in the
boom at Government House. Her sister.
Miss Bingham, is married to a relative of
Lady de Chair’s.
American Vice-Consul Moseley, of the
suave manner, goes off next week by way of
the Panama Canal to the West Indies on what
lie hopes is a long holiday, but with a promo-
tion in his pocket which he fears may mean
a move from Sydney. Mr. Moseley joins his
mother at Palm Beach, and then returns
with her to his home in Florida. Originally
the family came from Virginia.
Ensign Nicholson, of the Milwaukee, who
was cracked up so badly in a motor-cycle
accident, is back home on Mare Island, the
American Naval Station, being nursed by
his mother through the final stages of con-
valescence. The mind that was clouded at
intervals even after Sydney Hospital had
done its best is now quite clear and strong;
but one of tbe boy’s eyes will never see again.
The ensign’s mother sends good wishes to
Sydney friends who looked after her boy so
well. Incidentally, a Sydney nurse was com-
missioned by an American resident to take
charge of him on the voyage back to his
own people.
Ernest Watt will soon have to change the
name of the Club he founded from the
Cavalier to the Caravan —it is always on the
move. In its short life it has changed its
eating place three times: at different stages
it has been housed by the Cavalier, the Aus-
tralia and the Ambassadors. There’s a kind
or schism in its ranks just now, a group of
the members standing by the cold roast beef
of the Australia, and persisting in assembling
there every Wednesday to discuss it rather
than the three-course meal amid Stewart
Dawson’s marble catacombs. Melba, by the
way, is the Club’s newest member.
The Douglas Levy couple are paying the
penalty being newly married, and are
being led bit' to the highway to dyspepsia.
Mrs. Sep gave an elaborate dinner for her
son and his, bride Midway through the week
at Hillside—M jazzy commingling of youth
and age. Tony Hordern hosted another party
at the Ambassadors. The trouble about being
in Sydney’s Four Hundred is that the same
lot of guests turn up at every party, and a
stranger at the feast is regarded with as
much interest as Captain Cook was by the
aborigines. Incidentally, Mrs. Pat Levy, who
was reported dangerously ill last week, is
now almost well again.
The nurses of St. Vincent's put on a bright
little show during the week in aid of the
building fund of their home. The Nightin-
gales of the establishment have raised an
annual cheque for the hospital in this way
for the past 10 years ; and the friends of St.
Vincent’s roll up in great force to the enter-
tainment. It is always held in the quad-
rangle ; and the nursing and medical staff
supply the songandance programme. Last
week the grounds were even brighter than
usual with electrics, the supper was of a
greater excellence, and the bars the Police
Band flung forth more arresting than ever.
Sargent’s was the place chosen by the
Daily Teleguaph Recreation Club for a
send-off on Saturday evening to general-
manager Robson, who is leaving in the near
future for the Cold Country. About 70
members of the D.T. staff, including many
of the bright lights, were present. A fine
musical programme was followed by the
presentation of a travelling-bag.
The sudden death of Leonard Lawson robs
Sydney of an amateur musician of great
promise and of a most winning nature. He
did his best service perhaps for the Peter-
sham Choral Society, in which he was an
active worker for a number of years, taking
over the baton at a most critical time in the
society’s history—it was just about on the
rocks, financially at any rate. He died
much too soon: he was only 27.
The finest bit of world-wide advertising of
recent times goes to the credit of Miss Jew-
son, one of the new Labor M’s.P. for Nor-
wich. She must
get to her con-
stituents while
the railway-
men’s strike
was on; and
rather than
ride in black-
leg trains, she
would walk the
hund r ed-odd
miles. A n d
she did. And,
of course, she
needn’t. There
are probably a
dozen agencies
in London
which will
undertake t o
land you just
about a n y-
w here in
Britain by ’bus
or “charry” or
brewer's van or furniture cart —which-
ever you prefer. (Jive them time,
and they will work it out somehow.
After Jean Armstrong had won a kilometre
of decorations for her war-work she set her-
self up in London to do just such work for
Australian tourists ; but presently she found
she could do better for her clients as the
representative of a big firm in the business,
so she got herself attached to Pickford’s, in
High Ilolborn. And there she is now. mak-
ing smooth the path of hundreds of visitors
from down-under. One of her grateful
clients has just brought back this late por-
trait of the once well-known Sydney woman
worker.
There’s a gentle-eyed naturalist come to
Sydney from Kuranda—and that's at the
back of Barron Falls, in North Queensland
bringing with him a lifetime’s collection
of moths and butterflies and beetles, winged
magnificence alternating with stinged irides-
cence. St. James’s Hall is filled with long
tables on which specimen cases neatly
labelled give the family-tree of every crawl-
ing and flying beastie. Close at hand is tli -
collector of this important entomological ex-
hibition. F. P. Dodd, enthusiastically over-
flowing with information about the habits
and social customs of his old bushland
acquaintances. While the collection was in
Melbourne the Governor-General and Lady
Forster and Lord Stradbroke and Ins Conn-
tess paid calls; and twice Sir Matthew
Nathan has journeyed to Kuranda and seer,
the smaller exhibit there.
Frank Otter’s widow arrived in Sydney
the other day, after stopping in Melbourne
to pick up a young niece. In spite of the
fire in the Moldavia, in which she lost a fur
coat, uninsured, worth millions, Mrs. Otter s
clothes are making the eyes of Sydney
women pop. She is slimmer than when last
here, and her golden head is now worn
Titianed and shingled. The effect of this and
her beautiful skin above apricot satin frock-
ing, pearls so large they look unreal, and a
shimmery grey velvet cloak whose chinchilla
collar is nearly waist deep, has to be seen
to be believed. There w r as a diamond-
encrusted handbag with this outfit, and a
vanity box. For the first time in its life
this Letter had a graphic vision of the com-
motion in Solomon’s harem on the advent of
Sheba.
Salute E. A. Mowle, the Napoleon who
led the battle of the Australian Opera Chorus
versus the Italian Opera Chorus, headed by
Henry Ttussell, and won! And now every-
body’s happy,
even the man-
ager of the
Melba co m-
pany. The
male Austra-
-lia n chorus
trained by
Mr. Mow 1 e
has been for-
mally engaged
for the Syd-
ney season,
while eight of
his girls have
been given
small parts
for the whole
tour. It took
a lot of moral
courage to
stand up to
Henry It us-
s e 11, backed
by Melba and
tlie Firm; but a principle is a principle,
and Mowle stuck to his men. He has had
a long association with opera, starting as
far back as the Sapio-Dani Company, dur-
ing which season lie was with the orchestra.
In 1007 he chorus-mastered for the Tom Pol-
lard combination, was chorus-master again
with Bel Sorel during the “Madame Butter-
fly” season, and he trained the small-part
artists with the Melba Company in 1911.
An amusing point about the Opera Chorus
row is that Henry Russell, who fought so
hard to get the Italian chorus for the Melba
season in Australia, is a brother of Landon
Ronald, the London composer, w r ho is fight-
ing furiously against foreign influence in
English music.
The velour hat is to have a great innings
in Sydney for the three short months of our
winter, and after that the score will be to
the silverfisli and the moth. If you are a
humane person and a lover of animals you
may rejoice at the months of plenty the busy
mites will have among the rich fruitage of the
heavy-plated velour, and perhaps won’t
grudge the five or maybe nine guineas you
have given for the lid. But some of us,
who aren’t such lovers of the animal king-
dom, will be satisfied with hats not unite so
much in the style advertised in the Tatlek
or the Queen as “suitable for wear on the
moors.”
On a raging hot January day three able-
bodied shark's invaded Mosman Bay in pur-
suit of a stehool of mullet. They cruised
about under sight of some ,of the houses on
the Oremorne slope overlooking the bay,
sending the occupants crazy with excitement.
One lady, after telephoning some neighbors
to look what was in the bay, got the
Fisheries Department on the wire, and
gasped out her news. “Yairs,” said some-
one coolly, “what about ’em?” “But won’t
you do anything?” urged the lady. “Won’t
you send and net them?” “Net what —the
mullet?” A second lady rang up the Board
of Health. Another tried to reach an aider-
man friend. A fourth, wild with fear for
some small boys bathing, made several
attempts to get Dr. Arthur —“he’d be sure
to do something.” A solicitor's wife, almost
incoherent, telephoned her husband, and he,
after consideration, thought that, “unless the
sharks intended to remain, there wasn’t in
their visit any breach of professional cour-
tesy.” But perhaps the best joker of all
was the five-year-old who got ready to catch
them with a bent pin and a prawn.
The _ drift to the city does not show up
much in t'he family of Mr. and Mrs. A. .1.
Pankhurst, who the other day held a family
corroboree that looked like a mass meeting
at Gordon. Although the old people came
to Sydney when they retired four rears asm
all of their 11 children except ‘one eitv-
living son and two unmarried daughters had
to travel from country places in N.N.W and
Queensland for the spree, and the 44 grand-
children were mainly from the country too
Both Mr. and Mrs. Pankhurst were born in
Maitland. •
They met at Mosman. He was arrayed
in yachting togs, and suggested a blow in
his craft. Consenting, she accompanied him
to the Spit. Boarding a frail-looking skiff,
he hoisted a tiny sail, and -they floated away
up Middle Harbor. “Are you fond of sail-
ing?” he inquired, tilting liis cap at a Beatty-
like angle. "I adore yit!” she murmured.
“But when do we reach your yacht? I’m
tired of cruising round in your dinghy—
besides, it looks so silly.” ' A period of
silence ensued. Then as the navigator
headed again for the Spit a jackass on the
shore of Quaker’s Bay laughed violently as
if someone had suddenly dug him in' the
ribs with the ferrule of a pink parasol.
St. .James’s council is still helping the
unemployed to find work and supplying them
with clothing necessary for their jobs. St.
Simon and St. Jude’s old church, Campbell-
street, is the employment bureau. To-
morrow, Feb. 8, the crypt of St. James’s
will be open for offerings of clothes. Boots
are wanted badly.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. gave a discourse on book-keeping at the
annual meeting of the Federal Institute of Account-
ants, a festive affair in Finney’s cafe. Incidentally,
Sir Matt, remarked that he didn’t think women were
having quite a fair deal in being allowed to sit
for and pass ' exams, only to find it impossible to
become members of the Institute, the bar beiijg
merely that of sex. He suggested a swift remedy.
Irma Dearden has promised her fair young hand
to Rupert Wickham Flower, of Kirkston, Albion.
She is the only daughter of Mrs. William Dearden,
known in the Inky Way as Kathleen Watson, and
sister to Charles Dearden, who plays with tlie
Reynolds-de Tisne co. Irma has been on the boards
herself with some success —the Deardens’ Hamilton
home has its own miniature theatre.
On Foundation Day his Ex. went off to Buderlm
rbout, an hour after he arrived home from Too-
woomba, and had a look at the Boy Scouts’ shivoo.
Tiien he sat down to meat at Birdwood. The Cameron
c lan went with him; also Jack Turner, the new
A.D.C., who is the only son of Mrs. Leonard Turnej,
daughter-in-law of old John Turner, of Ivinellan.
A small cyclone wrecked several homes about
Brisbane on Jan. 26. The Church of the Little
Flower, at Ivedron, went down to it; also the
godly picture-show. .At the races, the chief damage
done was to georgette Frocks, smart hats arid
floral parasols. The canny took refuge in the cloak
and refreshment rooms at the first blast, and appeared
unstained and smiling after the deluge; hut there
were some foolish virgins, and, oh, their dainty
suede shoon!
Handsome Mrs. Edwin Lilley’s daughter Kathleen
has been made headmistress of St. Faith’s church
school at Yeppoon. She was educated at the Bris-
bane Grammar and the Sydney ’Varsity, is an M.A.,
and seems to have a big share of grandpa Charles
Lilley’s brains.
On Jan. 30 Marjorie Fowler and Dr. Leslie Call
were married by Canon Simmons. Ivory satin
draped the bride, with garnishings of silver flowers,
beautiful lace, silk tulle wedding veil and orange
flowers. Eleanor Hart and Maisie McCollim were
bridesmaids, in coral brocaded taffetas; and Murray
Graham supported the ’groom, with E. B. Cullen
best-manning. The Fowlers held a reception at
Indooroopilly. There were heaps of guests.
Nancy Macnaughton was tea-ed by Mrs. Macnish
the other day, and the, other guests brought heaps of
nice things for Nancy’s future kitchen. The next
day the Hawthorns poured more tea for her, and
still another function in her honor was staged by
Enid North at St. Malo, Highgate Hill.’
Branches of the Bush Book Club have been fare-
welling Mrs. Stanley Chapman, who is making off to
the Cold Country this month. A leather umbrella-
holder was handed to the departing lady at Mrs.
layer's tea on the 31st.
j Steele Rudd’s play “On Grubb’s Selection” was
iiwiged to help the hospitals in Toowoonrbk,. and . did
very well, thank you. One Sweeney acted Dad, and
Gerald Barlow stage-managed.
Jimbour House, on the once-famous station owned
by Joshua Bell, has again changed hands. Two years
ago it was bought by T. Wippel'l, a western pastoral-
ist.; now AY. Russell, of Dalmally, Roma, who owns
-Grassdale in the same district, takes it over. The
gre.v-stone place, surrounded by 6000 acres of free-
hold and overlooking the Jimbour Plains, is locally
known as the “Big House,” and is still a show
place, thorigh Time’s hand is now heavy upon it.
Most of the really old Queensland homesteads are
mumbling away. One of the finest and best preserved
is Talgai, near Warwick, built by G. Clarke 00
years ago. j
Mrs. Hepworth Collins has died in London. Born
in Rockhampton, her father, the Hon. Charles Sydney
Dick Melbourne, was the first solicitor to practise
there. She yvas educated in England and Paris, and
on her retuyn became one of the most striking fea-
tures of Queensland society. On her father’s death
she went to England, where she met her future
husband, at that time a distinguished engineer. She
was, besides' being beautiful, very accomplished, and
was an intimate friend of Queen Alexandra.

Bring surprises when
you combat the film
Make this test
Here is a test which will be a reve-
lation to you. It has brought to mil-
lions the glistening teeth you see
everywhere to-day. Ask for it and
watch the results. They will amaze
and delight you.
Why teeth discolour
That viscous film you feel on teeth
is what hides their lustre. Much of it
clings and stays. Soon it becomes dis-
colored, then it forms dingy coats
which brushing does not effectively
remove.
Film also holds food substance
which ferments and forms acid. It
holds the acid in contact with the
teeth to cause decay. Germs breed by
millions in it. They, with tartar, are
the chief cause of pyorrhea. Few
escape these film-caused troubles
under old-way methods.
Dental science has found two ways
to effectively fight that film. One acts
to disintegrate-the film at all stages of
formation. One removes it without
harmful scouring.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use
a film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

After many tests, these methods
were embodied in a new-type tooth
paste. The name is Pepsodent. Now
careful people of some fifty nations
employ it daily, largely by dental
advice.
No harshness
Some results are quickly seen and
felt. No one can doubt their benefits.
But Pepsodent also multiplies the

The tennis championship finals were
fought out under a dazzle of social lights.
The vice-regal Forsters looked in, she neatly
tailored in grey under a fluffy hat, wreathed
with forget-me-nots. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who
came with her mother, topped inky hangings
with her best almond-green lid. The visit-
ing Dunleath lady, there with her lord, was
coated and skirted in brown silk jersey,
with a ribbon-trimmed hat of a goldy
brown. Lady Ellen Lambart, who is
one of those unmistakably made-in-
England types —the best brand, of course
—sported striped blue cloth tailorings
of impeccable build, and a clean-cut hat-
brim with cherries anchoring the ribboos
tnat surrounded its dome. Countess Strad-
broke was frocked and caped in rust-brown
marocain under a blue-feathered roof, while
daughter Helena had cosily enclosed herself
in a woolly brocaded jacket of biscuit color
to match her skirt, and topped off with a
hat green as a newly-cut lawn. The stands
were again packed when the N. S. Wales
pair Sylvia Lance and Daphne Akhurst
scored off Mrs. Pat O’Hara Wood and Miss
Le Messurier in straight sets. Sylvia Lance
again asserted her tennis supremacy by
beating the Vic. cliampioness Esna Boyd in
the singles final. Both the Forsters and the
Stradbrokes were there to congratulate the
Sydney girls, who received an ovation from
the crowd as they filed out after their great
victory.
The Stradbrokes will be a divided family
during the next Head-of-the-River frenzy,
which, by the way, will happen at Geelong.
The youngest-but-one Rous son, whose last
birthday lifted him into double figures, will
be found cheering Melbourne Grammar as
a Grimwade House boy, while his elder
brothers, George and Keith, will be barrack-
ing for their own Scots’ College. Little
Christopher will now be the solitary inhabi-
tant of the Stonington nursery.
The visiting Leverhulme, who confesses to
being as dippy about jazzing as any flapper,
has been demonstrating to young Australia
that fox-trotting is a pastime for all ages.
The other night he staged a dinner-party at
Carlyon’s for a good-sized crowd, chiefly
his business confr&res here and their women-
folk. The wife of Melbourne manager Amess
stepped into the lead as hostess by his special
request. After a cheery interval of food
and chatter, Leverhulme led his little lot to
the cabaret-floor to end the evening with
jazz and frivolity. He always whirls in
knee-breeched evening togs, and he nearly
raised a scandal in church circles by
getting himself mistaken for a dis-
tinguished Anglican Gaiters. The soap lord
chortled delightedly when the cabaret
charmer from ’Frisco, Githa Calvert (she
first came to Australia with Lee White, and
has been roped in by Carlyon to sparkle
in his ballroom), syncopated up and caressed
his beaming dial with a big powder-puff.
It was a great time entirely, and the guests
agreed that, whatever his views on White
Australia, the lively old soap-maker is a good
sport.
Norman Brookes is heading for England,
where he will partner Tilden in the doubles
and Suzanne Lenglen in the mixed events at
Wimbledon. Mrs. Norman is going, of
course, to cheer her tennis-playing other
half, while the three Brooklets stay here
under the watchful eye of the grand-
parental Emmerton pair. This presumably
will be Norman’s last quest for champion-
ship laurels oversea. After Wimbledon he
will cross to America, and he intimates that
his racquet will be available in the Davis
Cup doubles if Australia calls for it. The
Herbert Brookes couple, with their family,
landed back from their jaunt abroad in time
for a chin-chin or two with the Norman pair
before they climbed aboard the lugger.
Among the farewells to Mrs. Norman was a
lunch at the Alexandra Club staged by Mrs.
George Lamgridge and the Best dame, at
which 15 other matrons and a Best daugh-
ter helped with the eating.
The way in which stage “talent” is cheap-
ened by voluntary contributions at the after-
noon gatherings of Australian social climbers
is the wonder of visitors from abroad. Just
when the hum of conversation and rattle of
teacups is at its worst, the meagre warble of
a twinkling star is seen getting drowned by
the hubbub. The mouth of the popular
attraction opens and shuts by the grand
piano, so anyone who looks that way knows
that the song is going on. Besides, the
accompaniment is sometimes audible. Lack
of voice is more apparent in these surround-
ings than it is on the stage, and as a rule
the songstress or songster is not beautiful to
see at close quarters. Somebody asks why
theatrical managers don’t have a clause in
the contract forbidding these reckless con-
fessions of the truth. ' Perhaps managements
think that newspaper reports, read by hun-
dreds of people who were not present, are
worth more than the disparaging criticisms
of small audiences that are mostly the same
audience every time. Also, there is a doubt
as to whether the mummer-chasing circle is
ever disillusioned. Come to think of it, one
never actually hears a disparaging comment
passed.
Good-looking Ray Tovell has persuaded a
charming Brighton girl, Madeleine Guthri:-,
to make , him happy. The ’groom-to-be, who
came out of the war with the rank of major
and a D. 5.0., is the younger son of Mrs.
Tovell Brown, of Indi, Brighton. Since
the death of her second husband, about a
year back, the widow has converted the
roomy homestead where she first settled as
a girl-bride into an up-to-date flathouse. On
the maternal side Ray is the grandson of
the late squatter Mitchell, of Albury, and a
nephew of Mrs. Chisholm, wife of the Syd-
ney medico. The elder Tovell son, Mitchell,
is headmaster of Scots’ College, Launces-
ton. The youngest, Jack, fell at the Gal-
lipoli landing.
The Robert Harper family has been
plunged into mourning by the passing of
Henry Harper’s wife, who went out with
tragic suddenness in a Melbourne private
hospital just as she was heading for con-
valescence after an operation. Her daughter,
who had gone for a Bay trip that day happy
in the belief that her parent was well on the
road to recovery, arrived back to find her-
self motherless. Henry Harper has been op
the sick list for some time past, and the
Robert Harper widow is recovering slowly
after her appendicitis operation; but the
only Henry Harper son, Colin —he married
the Henry Butlers’ daughter—was there to
comfort his sister.
The younger group of visiting and local
tennis stars put in a Sunday afternoon and
evening with Tom Patterson and his quar-
tette of sons. The cheery host is a grass-
widower at his Kew homestead, Rohese,
while Mrs. Tom is overseas placing the
youngest of the family, Mary, in a Swiss
seminary and collecting the elder girl, Nellie,
Melba’s namesake and niece, whose conti-
nental polishing is now complete. Mrs.
Gerald Patterson hostessed for dad-in-law in
black crepe lightly valanced with lace, and
Jessie Gerrard, a Patterson daughter-in-law-
elect, sported rival inky cr§pe. There was
an exciting ping-pong tournament into
which the tennis players threw themselves
with zest, and at the end the host found
himself acclaimed champion. Supper was
spread in an en.bankment of pink flowers.
Sylvia Lance and her fiance, R. Harper, were
in the group; also Daphne Akhurst, G.
Hone, J. Mclnnes, Jack Hawkes, Vere de
Bavay, Esna Boyd, and so on.
Roma Phillips, smiling at you in this
Rembrandt photo, is the 18-year-old girl
who has played and sung herself into notice
as Gretel in the Rigo show of “Hansel and
Gretel.” The
youthful star
went on with
no previous
stage experi-
ence, though
her voice had
been shaped by
Allan Bind-
ley, father of
Polly Feachum
P a u'l i n e.
Her father is
El i Phillips,
a well-known
business man.
His daughter’s
musical talents
do. not express
t h e m s e Ives
solely through
her voice—
they find fur-
ther outlets
on both piano
and violin. A typical young Australian, she
balances up her artistic emotions with a
love of sport, and can switch from music
to tennis without losing a beat.
In the little woodcutting township of
Bealiba there’s a house in which, over a
period of 20-odd years, only three male
children have been born. And each of them
arrived on February 14—St. Valentine’s
Day.
Kitty Russell Jackson is again putting
away her modelling clay and preparing to
rush off to Maoriland to meet her sea-
captain husband after a separation of four
years. She will trip round the Dominion
joining him at each port of call (a captain
may not allow his wife aboard his boat as
a passenger),, and then she will steam to
Honolulu and there farewell him before re-
turning to Melbourne. At present she is
hunting hats and chiffonery to make sure of
looking as nice as sne_ did when they last
met. Four years is a big slice out ot one s
youth.
Owing to the trouble he struck with Cab-
inet and Liberal party over the Dalhousie
by-election, Premier Lawson has not had
much of a holiday at the seaside at Morning-
ton One of his numerous infants asked him
if he couldn’t get rid of Crisis, to which dad
replied that he would put him in a well and
build over it if he could only catch him.
Note from an admiring male: —
I can give another instance of feminine resource
and pluck, accompanied by distaste for publicity.
In Melbourne Botanic Gardens the other day a boy
fell into the lake and disappeared among the reeds.
A man sitting on the a few yards away re-
mained where he was (he afterwards'explained that
he could not swim) ; but a young woman came at
top speed from the other side of the water, rapidly
discarded her blouse and skirt, jumped in and
brought the youngster' out. What is more, she
rendered first aid by restoring animation in
thoroughly professional style. The rescuer refused
to give her name; all that she asked was the
privilege of getting her garments dried at the care-
taker’s cottage.
This is Bob Sclilesinger, the young Davis
Cup player, who added to his tennis laurels
the other day by wresting the mixed doubles
championship from the Pat O’Hara Wood
pair, with the assistance of his sister Dorothy
H ope. He
showed his
first tennis
form as one of
the Melbourne
Grammar
four, and
thereafter as
a member of
the ’Varsity
team. In those
days he was
steering for a
medical
career, but
after his first
year he de-
c i d e d that
medicine was
not his voca-
tion. Before
crossing to
America as a
Davis Cup
player, the 23-
year-old youth had not previously starred
in any big matches, and he now admits that
he never realised how little he knew about
the game until he got to the U.S.A. In
future he will play under the N. S. Wales
banner, as he is about to seek a crust jin
Sydney. Rembrandt was responsible for
this view of him.
Norman Wilson, who has fallen but
of the race of life, after 74 years of good
going, was a son of the late Western District
squatter Alec Wilson, of Mount Emu sta-
tion, and a nephew, of the late S’Samuel.
His brothers, who. were all sportingly in-
clined like himself, preceded him over the
Great Divide; so did his younger sister, Mrs.
William Officer, jun. Norman Wilson and
his favorite brother, Hector, with their pals,
the Pender brothers, were the leading young
bloods of this city in their hot-headed youth.
Roth brothers were noted horsemen, and
they were always to the fore on racecourse
and hunting field. Norman earned his crust
for many years as a Queensland woolgrower,
and one handicap event at Caulfield w-as
called Coongy Coongy after his Bananaland
property. His widow, who is one of the
best-liked of Melbourne matrons, Was the
eldest of the late Dr. Grey’s octette of good-
looking daughters. One Wilson daughter,
Mollie, fluttered brightly in the J.C.W. musi-
cal comedy limelight before she married a
Dutchman and settled at the Hague: the
second girl tied up with a British Army
captain in London during the war years.
The youngest, Alison, lives at home.
The moral of a recent holiday tragedy is
that one should always think twice of a tree
before sitting under it. A bright and clever
Ballarat girl, after sea-bathing at Lome, sat
under a tree to watch the performances of
her friends. Came a gust of wind, and the
poor girl was fatally crushed. And from all
accounts there needn’t even be a gust to cause
damage at this time of year. Seemingly at
about midsummer Australian trees have a
habit of just disintegrating without appa-
rent cause.
Ex-Westralian Chief Justice Parker, with
his two youngest daughters, Mildred and
IS ora, are back in Melbourne after some
agreeable weeks in Perth. Mildred and an
elder sister, Ethel, launched out last year as
children’s frock and undy builders, in South
Yarra, not very far from the Parkers’ home
in Domain-road, but the activities having
outgrown their modest suburban rooms, they
have transferred to the city, and now ply
their skilful scissors and needles at York
House.
Mona MacLeod, who brought her golf-
sticks back by the Mooltan after more than a
year’s service on overseas links, did not put
up a bad record in any championship events
she took a hand in, although only a couple
of minor laurels came back in her kitbag.
She has now unpacked some of the latest
in tailorings—the kind with long slinky
coats. It appears that tailor-mades with
neck-covering shirtings are to be positively
the only cold-season street-wear. Further-
more, neckties are in again, which means
that husbands and brothers are in for a
rotten time.
The new Naval Medical Director, Sur-
geon-Commander C. A. Gayer Phipps, and
his newly-acquired wife will unpack in 20
Domain-road, South Yarra, when they come
in from their motor-touring ’moon. Mrs.
Phipps, who hails from London, where she
was a member of the Royal Miniature
Painters’ Society, is the daughter of a British
general, and the two were linked up last
month at St. Luke’s, Leura (N.S.W.). The
bride was led to the sacrifice by Dr. J. 11.
Phipps, of Mosman, brother of the ’groom,
and a third medical brother was also in the
offing.
Maud Harvie, who, with a brace of nieces,
is packing her gear for a trot round the
globe, farewelled her fellow-workers on the
Lost Dogs’ Home committee with an even-
ing party at her Malvern home. The bright
little spinster, who hostessed in grey silk,
was caught napping when her guests sud-
denly exploded a presentation packet con-
taining an aluminium travelling clock be-
tween the pleasantly-informal programme of
music and talk in the parlor and the supper
in the dining-room. Vet.-surgeon Lilian
Reid cheered the musical menu with a pure-
toned soprano which has been shaped with
nicety, and Maud Ilarvie’s own warble called
forth further admiring comment.
MacdoneU Woods, a small Hobart 12-
vcar-old, has topped the poll for all Tas-
mania in the State School qualifying exam-
inations, and landed a two-year bursary
after annexing the prize as dux of Hobart’s
biggest State School. He is a son of jour-
nalist “John Drayman” Woods, one-time
Speaker, of the Speck.
The recently-widowered Charles Ryan
knight will sail for Europe in March. As
his soldier son Rupert can't leave his job
with the British Army of Occupation at
Cologne, and daughter Maie is unable to get
back to Australia just now, the doctor is
going to join the two on the Rhine.
"Anew McMaster, the second lead in the
Oscar Asche combination, leaves for Europe
shortly to appear in a film to be staged in
Germany. To this young man goes the
credit of presenting the most-talked of lago
the Sydney stage has seen for years. Even
if you didn’t like his free-and-easy Venetian
there was sufficient original quality about
him to make you explain your reasons for
dislikp, And that’s a good deal in days when
thfc stage is filled with second-class copies
of first-class actors.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
Clare’s Polo Week came to a festive conclusion
with an afternoon’s racing and a dance in the Town
Hall. A mixed polo skurry and ladies’ polo skurry
gave the eternal feminine her chance in the former
show, and both Mrs. Lister Colley and Mrs. S. H.
Ayers were winners. Prizes were handed over by
Mrs. E. W. Hawker, whose husband is president of
the Clare Club, and with them a special word of
praise to secretary Ayers.
Mrs. A. A. Scarfe hostessed a dance at Glenelg
with the youngest set as guests —a cheerful party,
with the wide verandahs beflagged as a ballroom.
Five thousand pounds is to be spent on the Ross
Smith memorial, which is to be a statue of bronze
and marble, and will stand near the City Bridge,
midway between the bank of the Torrens and the
pathway leading up to the Oval gates. Designs are
to be in by September 30.
From England comes news that Peter Girdlestone
is to be Oxford’s No. 2 in the English ’Varsity boat-
race. Whereat there will be much rejoicing in the
parental dovecote. The ex-headmaster of St. Peters
College is an old rowing Blue himself, and during his
regime at the college here rowing boomed as it had
never done before.
Dr. Humphrey Marten has joined the ranks of the
oversea trippers, and the George Wares and their two
daughters set sail next month for England by way
of China. Returning voyagers are the Krakowskis
and the Ernest Tolleys and their daughter.
The committee that is to look after the British
Fleet during its visit here is waxing busy, and
among other things it plans a series of country trips
for the men. Special trains will take them from
the ships to our more getatable districts, where resi-
dents will take them in hand and entertain them for
the day. Clare has undertaken to be host to 500.
Lovely woman, who filled her summer wardrobe
with georgette and organdi, has had precious little
chance of using it so far —or, if she has used it, it
has been mostly at the risk of pneumonia. Hence
very mixed dressing at the A.R.C.’s Foundation Day
meeting—coats and skirts, or some compromise of
marocain or crepe de Chine for the cautious, and
filmy transparencies for those who’d teach the weather
its business. Three of the smartest figures on the
law’n belonged to the youngest set—two of them just
back from overseas, with pickings of London and
Paris in their boxes.
The Sydney Conservatorium is getting Gerald

The Maoriland-bred Bathos (Absurd —
Amyrin) has had another win at Canterbury Park
(N.S.W.)—his fourth since Westralian “Miss Muriel’’
bought him last September. He has a nice turn of
speed, is easy to ride and can carry weight (lOst.
was his burden on Saturday) ; and shrewd placing
has done the rest. Instead of sending him against
the Ptevopods and Otacres, his party has kept him
for three-year-old sprints at suburban courses, reason-
ing—(jorrectly —that these races would be gifts for
him, barring accidents. They have never got more
than 5 to 2 for their money, but on Saturday, as
on the three previous occasions, Bathos would have
had to fall down to get beaten. Two of Magpie’s
progeny gave that fine English horse an advertisement
in the divided Nursery Handicap, Gift of the Gab,

Nonmm Wilson, who died at the age of
.4 last week was a type of squatter-sportsman that
v ictona and S. Aus. have always produced m
bulk, for some reason, and the other States hardly
at all. At his best, like some of the Chirnsides, the
Watson brothers, neroert rower (.latnei r.. fa „ie-
Power who carries on the family tradition), Harry
Brush and a dozen others, he could meet any cross-
country jockey on fairly level terms. The V.A.T.U.
was founded by him, and he and a number of
hard-riding friends figured in the first steeplechase
at Ballarat 48 years ago. He owned Coongy C'oongv
in Queensland (hence the Coongy Handicap), and
went to live in the Northern State early in the
century. It was on his return in 1905 that he was
made judge to the V.A.T.C. in place of Harry Brush,
who was then dying as a result of injuries received
in the hunting field. He proved one of the best
judges any Australian racing club ever had. It
was the luck of the game that, though the possessor
of the keenest of eyes for a good horse, Wilson never
bought or bred the winner of a classic flat race.
Blue Mountain won the Caulfield Grand National
for him in 1887.
It is a long time since Tasmania had a
horse of class. Amazonia (St. Alwyne—The Amazon)
has seen his best day, but old as he is, and with
Bst. 91b. to hump for a mile and a half, he proved
much too good for the cattle he met in the £6OO
Launceston Cup. The ancient used to race in the
nomination of W. H. James, a one-time Geraldton
(W.A.) hairdresser, who made his pile in the Fenian
mine at Meekatharra. He is now owned by J
Patmore.

“Riverina”: Superstitious punters believe
there is always an “office” for the result of a
race if one is keen enough to detect it. I am in-
clined to agree. When the hairy outsider Paddy-
melon won the Rabbiters’ Cup at Snakebite Gully,
a wheezy lady of ridiculous bulk embraced me—
a total stranger—with unbridled enthusiasm. <fPaddy-
melon! Paddymelon!” she gurgled, “I knoo
e’d win! I ’ad two bob on ’im! ” As I disen-
tangled myself she explained: “Me seventh son is
Paddy, an’ I used to have a great friend at Dumbe-
bool named Mrs. Mellon—that’s why I knoo Paddy-
melon would win!” It was “the office” right
enough. If only the large lady had embraced me
before the race!
“Centurion”: The methods of an indivi-
dual brought to book in London point a moral for
the Australian punter. He was a bookmaker and the
matter in dispute was possession of a flat. In cross-
examination he admitted that he conducted His
bookmaking business under the names of Ford
Irving, Grant, Scott, Graham, the National Turf
Protection Society, the Turf Registry Inquiry Bureau
and the Turf Accountants’ Society. ‘ When Mr. Ford,
for instance, failed to part up on a race, as he and
the others frequently did, the aggrieved punter,
having been circularised, flew for relief to die
Turf Registry Inquiry Bureau. He was then put in
touch with the National Turf Protection Society,
which recommended him to deal in future with
Irving, Grant, Scott or Graham, not Ford If
any dispute arose with Graham, Irving, Grant or
Scott, it was referred for adjudication to the Turf
Accountants’ Society. No, the tote doesn’t exist in
Britain.
Though the Ma State has fared badly at
cricket (its second XI, like the first, was defeated
by Victoria), it had a great victory in the lawn-
tennis championships at Melbourne. J. O. Ander-
son won the singles after a five-set encounter on
soft turf with the energetic Schlesinger, and, aecom-
panied by the imperturbable Brookes, took the
doubles from Patterson and O’Hara Wood. Miss
Lance proved too subtle for the Victorian girl, Miss
Boyd, and, with the assistant e of the dainty Akhurst
lady, knocked out Mrs. O’Hara Wood and Miss Le
Messurier in the doubles. The mixed doubles also
fell to the Harborsiders, J. Willard and Miss
Akhurst, though the opposition was composed of
Hone and Miss Boyd. Only in the junior singles
was the tattered banner of Victoria kept flying.
Here the final resolved itself into a formidable duel
between the Ballarat infant, 11. A. Coldham, and
Ben, the most promising of the Dunlop nursery;
but the latter didn’t carry enough guns on this
occasion, and was wiped out in a third set running
to 24 games.
: Norman Brookes played beautifully in
the doubles. Considering that he is on the way to
47 shots were wonderful. His wristy returns
of service to the feet of the incoming Wood were
OAR HONE, the S.A, tennis giant, of wkom
Anderson has a glowing opinion.
not more charming than his adept volleys at acute
angles that an active racquet couldn’t touch. His
service was also swerving and breaking superbly,
and he was rarely caught out of position. Never-
theless, one mustn’t enlarge too much on this one
performance. That Patterson and Wood were play-
inn- .badly was even to the ball-boys. Wood
served fairly well, but, Patterson hadn’t an ace in
either hand. Neither Brookes nor Anderson can
h V/‘ when , he is serving at his top, but on that
“ alt emoon he se . em ed to be giving an exhibition
tor a. slow-motion picture. Time and again he was
° ack °r too umvatehful to intercept mid-
comt volleys which on other occasions he would
have returned to unplayable positions. Wood was
equally wanting in severity, and maybe an effort to
nuise his wrenched shoulder was responsible for his
display. And the game proved that J. O. Anderson
“ t a doubles player. He hasn’t the temperament
toi team work, and he often hangs back after deliver-
ing his own service, leaving a veritable esplanade
™i, sl ? e H ne w / nr >ei;s. Certainly he can intercept
well at the net, but of the higiier strategy of posi-
tional play he hardly knows enough to keep his
brains awake. If Brookes finds his brother selectors
willing to include him in the Davis Cup team, I
hope he will go into partnership with Wood, who
was his memorable accomplice in the straight-
defeat of ffilden and Johnston in Melbourne
about four years ago.
* * *
Linesman : Though Anderson and
Hawkes are unavailable, there is talk of imparting
gate interest to this year’s Davis Cup by sending: a
team composed of Patterson, O’Hara Wood, Brookes
and another—probably Schlesinger, if he can get
leave from his new job in Sydney. In the absence
oi Anderson and Hawkes, Brookes would be an asset,
but seeing that there is not much hope of wrenching
the Cup from the U.S., unless Tilden or Johnston or
both drop out which, despite all rumors, seems
unlikely—-the enterprise, if proceeded with, will re-
solve itself into a hunt for gate-monev. And it might
be unsuccessful even in that particular. With Ander-
son an absentee, there is no authority for assuming
that Australia would survive the final with the
winner of the European zone. Should Spain or
I ranee win the European half of the argument,
there would be no chance of an easy victory for
Australia. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth
?t o U a withdraw from this year’s contest, as the
U.S.A. did in 1912 and 1919.
“Tin Hat”: For picturesque English the
football reporters (B. 24/1/ 24) are not m it with
the word-painters who “do” the tennis matches.
There is one m Melbourne who has captured my
fancy. He likens Hone’s play to “the irresistible sweet)
of a cavalry charge,” and “a thoroughbred racing
down the home stretch with the bit in his teeth.”
Willard suggests “the sudden action of steel wire
tightly coiled.” The shots of Mclnnes “had been
sharpened to cutting-edge on the whetstone of sue-
cess. In Mac.’s essay with the racquet there were
subtle half tones as well as broad black-and-white
work—the faint pencilling of the delicate drop volley
that bites with an engraver’s insistence.” I am
living in hope that the same writer will be sent to
a chess tournament. That’ll test him.
Wally Coppins and George Dempsey, the
two brilliant young N.S.W. cyclists, covered them-
seives with glory in the Australian championships
at Melbourne. Coppins won the half-mile from
Dempsey in Imin. 18see., and Dempsey reversed the
placings in the 10 miles —time, 23min. 41sec. The
Olympic people have selected Dempsey, Coppins,
Bioadbent (Vic.) and Munro (Q.), to conioete in
the track events at Paris, and S. Ramsden (Vic.),
C Burness and A. C. Flood (N.S.W.) are to be
the road riders. That is, if there is monev enough
to send them all. There isn’t nearly enough yet
for a good all-round team, although some handsome
subscriptions are coming in, notably a shilling-in-
the-pound subsidy from the proprietors of Wolfe’s
Schnapps.

With Charlton a non-starter, Arne Borg
greatly improved in condition since the Sydney
authorities insisted on his swimming in their quarter-
mile championship within eight days of his arrival
after a six-weeks’ voyage—won the mile State title in
remarkable style at Sydney baths. He finished 125
yards ahead of Christie in the world’s record time
of 22min. 345ec.—75 2-ssee. faster than Beaure-
paire s Australian figures. Borg also demonstrated
his ability as a sprinter by dead-heating with Herald
over 100 yards in 55sec. After his defeat in the
quarter-mile he proclaimed Charlton his master. He
now declares that he will beat the Manly youth in
the 800 and 1500 metres at Paris, and that Weis-
muller will vanquish the pair of them in the 400
metres.
Two Australian sailing championships
changed hands on Saturday. At Sydney the H. C
Press, owned by the veteran of' that name and
skippered by Chris Webb, cleared out from seven
othei 18-footers, including three from Queensland,
and won with 2min. 47sec. to spare. Awaya and
Vione (Q.) were next. At Brisbane Ajax (Q.)
defeated Miss Curious (N.S.W.) and 10 other 16ft.
skiffs, but there was only iSsec. between first and
second, and Furious, another Queensland boat, was
a mere 6sec. astern.

An uninteresting dispute at Sydney
Stadium was ended in the eleventh round by die
referee’s declaration that Mike Flynn had fouled
Jimmy Semmens. It was Flynn’s second offence
against Semmens, and on each occasion he was a
mile behind on points. He is a good boy in his
class, but it isn’t the Victorian’s class.
Semmens is shortly to meet Grime, who, having
regained the featherweight championship from Ris-
tuccia, talks of plucking the bantamweight crown
from the Victorian’s brow and of going after Godfrev
for the lightweight title. Terry McGovern nearl'v
achieved the same feat in America, and wrecked his
constitution in the process.

Wodgil”; Consider Ponsford’s perform-
ances in representative cricket: 6 and 19 v. Douglas’s
Englishmen; 62 v. Maclaren’s team; 162 and 429 v
Tasmania; 108, 17, 81 and 159 v. S.A. • 248 v
Queensland; 37 and 72 v. N.S.W. second eleven •’
45, 24, 110 and 110 n.o. v. N. S. Whiles Aggre-
gate, 1689; average, 112.6. How delightful to re-
flect that the Victorian selectors didn’t reckon him
good enough for the Sheffield Shield competition until
the match against S.A. in February last year!
“Merri Creek” : In spite of Victoria hav-
ing proved itself the premier cricketing State, Sydney
people still talk as if the Australian XI to meet the
Englishmen in 1924 should consist of Collins, Banls-
ley, Macartney, Oldfield, Gregory, Kelleway, Hendry
Taylor, Kippax, Andrews and Mailev. Some of them
handsomely admit that Ponsford has earned a
position, but confess to being puzzled as to who
should make way for him. The selectors will be less
embarrassed or biased. Bardsley will be dropped
for a certainty. His batting is on the wane, and he
is getting slow in the field. Ponsford steps into his
place as opening batsman and outfield. Mailey is
also due for the sacrifice. Hartkopf is at least his
equal as slow bowler and fieldsman, and decidedly
his superior as a batsman. Hendry’s chances hinge
on whether Jack Gregory is back in the game. If
Jack is available, there will be no room for Hendry,
but with Jack away Htndry will have to be played
for his slip-fielding, and Wallace, the Victorian, for
his fast bowling. It is a question whether Collins
or Mayne should be the captain and Oldfield or Love
the wicket-keeper. Collins fielded badly during the
N.S.W.-Vic. match and didn’t handle his bowlers
particularly well. But his record as an opening
batsman cannot be overlooked, and I would include
him in that capacity, with Mayne as captain. There
is not much to chose betw'een Love and Oldfield, but
Love is surely entitled to the preference, His
’keeping during the Ma State’s second innings at
Sydney was as good as any in the match, and he is
a much better batsman than Oldfield or Ellis. Ivelle-
way, Ryder, Arthur Richardson and Macartney may
be regarded as certainties ; in ordinary circumstances
there is no need for a left-hand bowler on Australian
wickets, but if the necessity arises Mac. can do as
well as either Whitty or Hornibrook, and he is
still as likely to make a hundred as any man
breathing. If Gregory is unable to play, the team,
in my judgment, should consist of Mayne (captain),
Ponsford, Ryder, Hartkopf, Love, Wallace (Vic.),
Arthur Richardson (S.A.), Collins, lielleway, Macart-
ney and Hendry. With Gregory on hand, he and
Kippax should go in instead of Hendry and Wallace.
“Trekle”: The Bulletin’s censure of the
covered wicket (31/l/’24) finds an echo in an article
written for “Plum” Warner’s Cricketer by Archie
Maclaren. By this protection, he says, Australia is
limiting herself to hard and fast wickets, and making
the task of discovering a versatile bowler extremely
difficult. Also the prac-
tice encourages bats-
men to play the care-
ful and slow game
which is successful
enough on the true
pitch, but which
would be their down-
fall on the difficult
turning wickets of
England. When in
Australia Maclaren
spoke to all the lead-
ing players on die
matter, and told them
of the certain disaster
that would befall them
when they met a wet
English summer. Not
one of them it seems,
defended the business ;
on the contrary, all
agreed that it would
lead, sooner or later,
to smashing defeats.
CROCKETT,
the veteran
Vic. umpire.
24/iw?? lir iw n ” : As “ p,ail ” sfl y s (B.
z4/l/ 24), Mayne never accused Jack Gregory of
aving deliberately bowled at the man instead of
the wicket, and made it clear to the big fellow
when in Sydney Still, the A.I.F. wonder has had
to put up with the point-blank accusation from more
than one English critic, nor is he the only Australian
bowler to have been so aspersed. When Jones
played his first match in England—it was against
Eord Sheffield s Xl—he whipped a couple into W.
tr. urace s ribs, and the man-mountain was shaken
to his foundations. Yells of “murder” and “thrower”
resounded from one end of England to the other,
and the Observer complimented Jones on being
cl-fi hurl” the ball at a tremendous pace,
htm, similar accusations were made against Cross-
land, Mold, Brearley, and even F. R. Foster. “Bail"
is right about the comparative bumping of Gregory
and Cotter. Jack is a giant, who delivers from the
highest possible point, with an armswing like
that oi a windmill, whereas poor “Tibby” was
short and nuggety, with the lowest delivery the
writer has seen among modern fast bowlers. But
as ior control of the ball, “Tib” was a whale for
wides, which Jack seldom bowls.
. The principle of Sunday games has been
given a big lift in Adelaide by the City Council,
the parklands find room for several hundred clubs
each with its own pitch, and including nearly every
game bar polo. The Council of Churches suggested
that Sunday sport should be prohibited, and got an
informal opinion that nothing could be done unless
the games were “organised” affairs. It then secured
the printed programme of a Hotel Cricket Associa-
tion as evidence; but even then the parklands com-
mittee recommended “Letter received, no action
taken, and the City Council did just that.

Mashie” : Golf is the favorite pastime of
British Prime Ministers. Asquith still plays, and
t;J°yd George indulges in a sort of game which
Galloper F. E. Smith (now Lord Birkenhead) once
described in the witticism: “He came, he pawed, he
bunkered.” Bonar Law spent some of his happiest
hours with a bag of clubs, and Baldwin has been
bent over many a putt on the greens. But he and
Asquith are undistinguished amateurs compared with
Ramsay Macdonald. Britain’s latest P.M. is a very
good hand; before the war he was one of the stars
of the exclusive Moray club. Stanley Melbourne
Bruce is a pretty good golfer. Half-Prime Minister
Page plays tennis, which a wag once said he had
learnt on the golf links. Using the regulation three
balls on a private court he lifted two successive
returns on to a neighboring roof. “Two up and one
to play,” murmured his opponent.
“Valamae”: “Nitric” (B. 17/l/’24), writ-
ing of one-armed men and their accomplishments in
sport, mentions the Bananaland tennis champion,
St. John, who also plays cricket and Rugby passably,
despite his disability. One of the teams in the last
polo tournament, at Toowoomba (Q.) - contained a
one-armed horseman, who played a better game than
many others do with the use of both hands The
reins were held on the stump of the left arm.
Cecil Gardner, a one-armed boy, has been plaving
in championship golf at the Dunbar links, Scotland,
and according to the home papers, gave “a won-
derful exhibitition. ” So the one-armed man can
sometimes hold his own in sport against his more
fortunate cobbers.
TOUGH LUCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A speed motorist, attempting to break the Mel-
bourne-Sydney record last Saturday, was blocked
for 10 minutes at a railway-crossing by a goods train
and later involved himself with the police by collid-
ing with a flock of sheep. After this, he complained
bitterly, there was no chance of success.”
He comes! His pace is cinematographic,
His record-breaking mission manifest.
Ho! clear the course of ordinary traffic,
Stock, buggies, waggons, horsemen and the rest.
Delete yourselves, pedestrian and drover,
Remember ’twill be yours, not his, the crime
If, heedless of his honks, you get run over,
And, when he seems on velvet or in clover,
Play havoc with his time.
Out of his path! Give him, you lesser fry, way !
The fire is not more fierce, the wind more fleet.
’Ware lest you block his passage o’er the highway
Or make him swerve in streaking down the street,
Have you no rights? you ask. None, ignoramus !
You’re only bound on ordinary biz.,
While he, blest soul, possesses a mandamus
To make some brand of motor-car more famous
Than it already is.
Is’t not a shame a goods train should delay him
When on his meteoric journey loosed?
A burning wrong that stupid sheep should stay him
From giving somebody’s petrol a boost?
Picture his bitterness of soul when finding
That a deaf swagman or a stubborn cow—
Emblems of life monotonous and grinding—
Has stopped him from Olympian laurels binding
Around his eagle brow !
He comes! He cleaves the air like arrow flashing.
Will no one frame a law to clear the course
When heroes such as these are record-smashing
Of other folk a-wheel, a-foot, a-horse ?
Alternatively, how about installing
An instrument with 40-lionpower roar
On racing cars—to herald gents whose calling
Is tearing o’er the roads at speed appalling,
Same as the golfer’s “Fore” ?

asylum. Fergus roamed about the goldfields as a
casual —very casual—freelance journalist; and his
description of the rush to Gabriel’s Gully was an
epic of the period. A lesser-known novel of Hume’s,
“Shadows in the Snow,” was set up in the Otago
Daily Times office in the days when George Fen-
wick, now managing director, was copy-boy. For a
time Fergus was star reporter on the Western Star,
Riverton, in the days when my dad owned the rag.
le Pana ’: When R. W. Robson, lately general-
manager of Sydney Telegraph, puts his suit-case
aboard for Fogland it will not be his first deep-sea
trip. In 1914 he toured the Island groups of the
Eastern and Western Pacific with Maui Pomare,
heavyweight Minister in Massey’s Maoriland Gov-
ernment. The going was a trifle slow in the Cook
Group, but when the little party hit Nukualofa,
Tonga, things hummed. The few decadent beach-
combers made a big fuss of Robson, who had a fine
baritone voice which he would lift in song on starry
nights in opposition to the multitude of kava
parties. Even now, at this late date, Robson is
referred to in Nukualofa as “te tagata himine lelei,”
the man with the silvery voice.
“D.F.”: Tom Iredale, who has come to Sydney
after doing most of the art work for Gregory Mat-
thews’s great book on the birds of Australia, is a
picturesque figure in a velvet coat of the kind once
generally affected by artists. Years ago he once
spent 10 months on the lonely Itermadec Group,
400 miles north of M.L. A family named Bell were
the only other human beings in residence; and they
left later, after the gardens had been ruined by a
waterspout. What with goats, mutton-birds, hurri-
canes, eruptions and waterspouts, the Kermadecs are
well up to Juan Fernandez as a Crusoe island. Ire-
dale, by the way, has a bone to pick with Frank
Builon about the Kermadecs. In one of his books
Bulhn describes a landing on one of the islands in
terms which show such an amazing ignorance of
conditions, Iredale says, that it is hard to believe
the author was ever there.
"H.M.”; Sydney Daily Mail, now the Labor
Daily, was originally intended for a Nationalist
paper; Premier Fuller was one of the shareholders.
But Fuller changed his mind, or had it changed for
him, and sold his shares to P. J. Minahan, Labor
M.L.A. ; and that changed the whole policy of the p per.
An attempt was made as early as that to swing
Labor Papers, Ltd., into the venture, but the pre-
valence of R.C. influence scared the Laborites. Ulti-
mately the Daily Mail broke out as a free-speaking
little journal with a considerable amount of green
in its views, some brightness and vigor, and a record
quantity of typographical errors. Perhaps its most
notable achievement was compelling its old-established
contemporaries to come back to a penny, although
for weeks it had to fight for the right to a circula-
tion. The Labor Daily hasn’t got Labor Papers, Ltd.,
behind it; that co. still exists, and still presumably
hopes to bring out the World. The A.W.U. is its
principal union supporter; which explains why tiie
Worker (in the same stable) has given the new
paper a very cold reception.
“R.G.N.C.”: One of Melbourne’s oldest women’s
weeklies has as its star social writer a plain, blunt
person, who, though facile enough and even inti-
mate on women’s subjects, is indubitably male. A
dear old lady from the country had been greatly
interested by a series of articles of the Dr. Crane
type, so much so that, being on a visit to Mel-
bourne, she determined to call and thank the good
woman whose writing had afforded her such pleasure.
She explained to the Cerberus of the office whence
she had come and why. “I must,” she said, “see
the writer of those articles. I never read anything
so thoroughly womanly and understanding.” Cer-
berus, bored stiff, piloted her up three steep flights
of stairs and indicated an open door. “There!”
he said and stole silently away. The old lady
inserted her head only—then turned and bolted.
“My dear,” she said, the street and her companion
regained, “she was a man!” “Nonsense,” pro-
tested the companion. “These literary people, you
know. Bobbed hair and tailor-made coats and all
that.” “My <4ear,” repeated the other solemnly,
“he had a beard!” And so more simple faith
came tumbling to the ground.
Frank White sees a friend off
Just cashed in here at New York, John R.
Rathom, an Australian who made newspaper history
in this country. Born in Melbourne 56 years ago,
and educated at Whinham College, Adelaide, he
became known in the United 1 States as an aggressive
journalist, and left a colorful streak in Seattle,
San Francisco and Chicago before he took the helm
of the Providence Journal a dozen years ago. He
was also for some time a director of the Associated
Press. His “inside stuff” on German activities here
during the early years of the war caused a big
sensation, and he “scooped’’ the metropolitan dailies
time and again. “Big John” (he scaled over 20
stone) was always keen on Australian affairs, and
we spent many hours together on different occasions
chewing recent Bulletins. And three times out of
five the conclusion would be the same or thereabout:
“Well, now, drop ’em a line and tell ’em to keep
their back stiff on the White question. That ought
to be our contribution to the knowledge with which
our native land is governed.” Incidentally, he had
firmly decided that Adelaide was the most beautiful
city in the world. An operation over a year ago
started something from which he was destined never
to recover.
A TITLE TO SALVATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The preponderance of educated opinion is against
splitting the infinitive.”— Australasian.
The pressman’s soul was at the gate
Of Heaven. He eyed the same askance.
Of being admitted, sad to state,
He didn’t greatly like nis chance.
Peter the hesitance perceived ;
“Buck up,” he boomed—“you’ve but to show
Some bright distinction you achieved,
Some kudos, in your crait below.
Some sore temptation nobly fought
To Heaven still the entry gives.”
The candidate a moment thought,
Then at the life-line thrown he caught:
“I never split infinitives 1 ”
“That I have stooped to Cockney rhymes
Like ‘dawn’ ana ‘morn’ 1 know —and rue.
Still, Gordon did the same at times;
Aye, and mellifluous Swinburne, too.
I've tortured many a helpless word,
‘lntrigue’ and ‘gesture’ and ‘obsess,’
Nor shunned such patently absurd
Inanities as ‘more or less.’
At blindly mixing ‘shall’ and ‘will’
1 doubt a worse offender lives;
My journalistic laches would fill
Charge sheets innumerable. Still
1 never split infinitives.
“Firewood I've split, and hairs, and beer
In countless bottles, I admit,
But of one infamy I’m clear—
This part of speech I’ve never split.”
Straight in tne lock the key did creak.
“Pass in, my son,” the Saint replied ;
“It leaves, achievement so unique,
’ our balance on the credit side.
Death is the wage of sin, we’re told,
Rare virtues also pay their divs.”
And now inside th’ angelic fold
There plays upon a harp of gold
One chap who past the barrier bowled
By dodging split infinitives.

with his garrulous imbecilities—for another
ten days. After that the absent-minded old
bird will drop out. On Feb. 16 the talented
Vanbrugh-Boucicault combination will ap-
near in “Miss Nell o’ New Orleans.”
“Rockets” is still filling Sydney Grand
Opera House with glee, like the children
who grew in beauty side by side in one of
Mrs. Hemans’s affecting ballads. But the end
is in sight; there are only nine more nights
to see Lorna and Toots Pounds, Charles
Austin and the rest.
“Kissing Time” has only two more nights
to go at Sydney Royal. On Saturday “De
Luxe Annie” arrives—an abrupt transition
from musical comedy to mystery drama, from
Madge Elliott and Alfred Frith to Emelie
Polini and Frank Harvey.
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, on Saturday,
Gladys Moncrieff will step out of the part
and the trappings of “The Merry Widow”
to transfer herself to the frocks and the role
of “Sybil,” Claude Flemming and a com-
pany of proved merit co-operating.
At Sydney Tivoli Joy and Juan are still
dancing with the joyous abandon of twin
souls and the careless grace of coquettish
butterflies. Reg Thornton displays facility as
a gag-and-patter merchant, and Alec Regan
sings with some tunefulness and illimitable
confidence. Pharus expounds his simple
cures in a rather depressing recitative, while
elderly gents with thinning locks furtively
rub their finger-nails together wondering if
there’s anything in it. Jen Latona looks like
becoming a prime favorite with the audience,
as is the due of a clever entertainer with an
engaging presence. Will Hay as the school-
master comedian is assisted in some really
excellent fooling by Alfred Garcier and Bert
Platt.
Wesley. Barry as the freckled “Printer’s
Devil” keeps the pot of humor well on the
boil at Sydney Lyceum. With Wesley absent,
the sugary story of the usual small-town in-
trigue for the well-manicured hand of the
banker’s daughter would be one of the week’s
tamest. Claire Windsor is the female lead
ot the supporting picture, “The Blot,” the
smudge being the awful conditions under
which many Amurkan dominies labor. “To
the Last Man,” at the Globe, is a pretty
fierce'tale of cattle-duffing and family feuds,
and the casualty list is lengthened several
cubits when one side dynamites a hill. “Peg
o’ My Heart” is enrapturing those who like
to take their entertainment without brain-
fag ; and on view for the same money is a
Zane Grey thriller. Faked marriage certi-
ficates, threatened lyncliings, pitched battles
between the I.W.W. and “Vigilantes” and
the killing of a farmer and his wife are a
few of the highly moral titbits. “Within the
Law,” the crook-drama of fame, has popped
its head up in Shadowland, and, at Hoyt’s,
Norma Talmadge plays the miss who,
wrongly accused of tampering with the
Eighth Commandment, develops an anti-
social kink and joins up with a gang of
crooks. Also at Hoyt’s is “Blinky,” a blush-
ing raw recruit, who rises to prodigious
heights of valor and grabs the Major’s daugh-
ter from the hands of a flapper-snatching lot
of roughs. It seems to be an even bet that
“If Winter Homes,” at the Crystal Palace,
will just about see Autumn arrive.
Frank Rigo has removed his “Barber of
Seville” to Melbourne Olympia, where there
is room for a larger multitude than even his
finest adventures in opera would ordinarily
draw. However, he is now afforded fewer
reasons to be sorry for himself, for the trim
light soprano of Dawn Asslieton and the
general good work of the company are be-
coming known, with the result that there is
a louder buzz at the box-office. Of course,
his beauteous leading lady is the main attrac-
tion. Rosina gains in piquancy, even if she
does flout the stodgy convention of artless in-
experience. .As for the others, they are improv-
ing all the time. Leslie Gordon, who took Dr.
Bartolo at short notice, is especially com-
mended for his handling of the character. It
is worth w’hile mentioning, for the sake of
the contrast, that the young actor last ap-
peared in Melbourne as the wayback
bemoaning his lorst teeth in the Bert Bailey
production of “The Sentimental Bloke.”
At Melbourne Majesty’s “Aladdin” is still
sailing along under bare poles, as it were.
It has been contended that the unclad legs
would look prettier in tights, but, since tights
allow’ opportunities for mis-statements of
contour, there are many who prefer the
genuine flesh and blood. In this instance a
plebiscite would probably favor the un-
adorned calves because they belong to such a
bonnie team of girls. There are one or two
blondes in the first row that would turn a
verger’s thoughts from home.
“Mother Goose” is now laying eggs for the
populace eight times a week at Melbourne
Palace. Charles Heslop continues to find it
difficult to keep his face in shape, while his
body is becoming more and more like that of
a man suffering simultaneously from St.
Vitus’s dance and Swedish drill. On the
other hand the Dame of Joe Brennan is a
soothing reminder of an actor resting. One
drawback about Joseph is that he hasn’t a
countenance of many colors to typify the
proverbial taste for drink. If Brennan would
only wear an imitation of a bashed eye
with a yard of sticking-plaster, liis Dame
would go up 100 per cent, in the estimation
of the audience.
. The departure of Gracie Lavers from the
cast of “Sally,” at Melbourne Royal, lias
made an opening for Thelma Burness in
Gracic’s part of Rosie Rafferty. Thelma is
blonde and cool, where Gracie was dark and

sparkling, but the difference needn’t worry
one, seeing that Miss Rafferty’s main func-
tion is to accept as a matter of course the
imbecilities of George Gee. In this respect
the damsel is emulating many in the audi-
ence to a remarkable degree.
The pathos and passion associated with
the production of “My Lady’s Dress” will
cease to excite the multitude at Melbourne
King’s to-night. On Saturday Oscar Asche
doubles his previous self as Othello, whilst
the poisonous tongue of I ago will be in the
mouth of Anew McMaster. Doris Cham-
pion has been engaged to perish beautifully
as Desdemona.
Wesley Pierce has now returned to fill
the vacancy that has been yawning for him
in “Little Nellie Kelly,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, whereat the “Romany Tango” is
again in action, with slim Hazel Harris as
the other partner in the disturbance. The-
graceful turn of these dancers plus the
hearty by-play of Mark Daly and May
Beatty provides much relief from the senti-
ment of one or two of the songs. A woeful
offender is the banal dirge, “You Remind
Me of My Moth-all.” One might call it
the elixir of mush, and it shows its Ameri-
can origin in every line.
“Oliver Twist,” with Jackie Coogan in
the name-part, is having an innings at
Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week. The picture
sticks scrupulously t 0 the text, the Cali-
fornian adapters having nobly resisted the
temptation to thrust a cowboy’s Colt in the
hands of W. Sikes. Lon Chaney, as Fag’n,
a most picturesque monster. “Crossed
Wires,” which mortgages the other half of
Hoyt’s programme, enables Gladys Walton
to get into society by means that probably
wouldn’t have been altogether approved by
dear Queen Victoria; but, all the same, she
is forgiven and happily married off in the
end. The 124,678 th artist who marries his
model and is heartily cursed by his incensed
father provides Anita Stewart with an excuse
for revealing herself once more to
the Melbourne Majestic’s followers. The
Britannia is giving a look down “Main
Street” for sixpence, while the Melba has
found room for a New Orleans romance,
“Cameo Kirby,” which will fill a pacifist
with despair.
Adelaide shows continue exactly as they
were a week ago, except that Neilie Bram-
ley, at the Royal, is going in for stronger
work —“Madame X” and “Leah Klesehna”;
and at the Town Hall some reckless humor
is caused by the mesmerism of McEwin.
“Mancam”: My notion is that “getting
the bird” (B. 31 /l/'24) was derived from
Ecclesiastes xii, 4 :
And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and
all the daughters of music shall be brought low.
“T. 0.1.”: An early entertainment at the
Melbourne Athenaeum (B. 31/l/’24) was a
series of “Readings from Various A
by John Finnamore (he wrote “Francesca
"Vasari’’ and “Carpio”), W. M. Hudspeth
(known afterwards on the stage as “W. H
Metcalfe”) and myself. It happened in the
early ’sixties, and I am the only survivor.
“Topee”: “A.P.” (B. 31/l/’24) asks what
became of baritone Verdi (Tiie B.’s Bil-
greni) ? I have always understood that he
left Australia for S’Africa, and died while
hotelkeeping on the Rand.
“Pantagruel”: “Blob’s” trance-man (B.
10/l/’24), or a party in the same line of
business, showed at Rockhampton (Q.) last
year. He did his cataleptic turn in a tent,
but a hole was thoughtfully dug at one side
of it, and Rockhampton, a frugal place, soon
discovered that, by bending the body a bit.
it could see him gratis. So he returned to
consciousness, cursed eloquently, and moved
on. He had a sad-eyed partner, who was
mostly engaged in protecting the recumbent
one from the curiosity of the Rockhampton
kid, the latter having equipped himself for
scientific research with long sticks from
which pins protruded.
“Bello”: Van Biene, who visited Aus-
tralia with “The Broken Melody” about 20
years ago, was once commanded to play his
’cello before Leopold, King of the Belgians,
The Grand Court Panjandrum told Van
Biene that lI.M. didn’t care for sad, slushy
stuff; he wanted fireworks. So the ’cellist
trotted out the most florid things in his re-
pertoire. When it was all over Van Biene
was presented to the King. “I am charmed,”
said 11. M., “with your playing, Air. Van
Biene. I have heard Popper” (Van Biene
bowed in gratified expectation), “I have
heard Gerardy” (another bow and a smirk),
“I have heard all the other great ’cello artists”
(“Your A -jesty,” murmured the purring
Van Biene), “but never have I seen one
who perspired as much as you do!”
“Bezique” : It is unnecessary for a theatri-
cal novice to possess talent, provided she
has sufficient social pull. Take the case
of a damsel whom the newspapers prema-
turely boosted as a “most promising artist,"
but who, when inspected without prejudice,
loomed no bigger than a runner-up in a way-
back competition. Her father is a Promi-
nent Personage. His partner is a director of
the theatrical organisation and is chairman
of a newspaper. No girl could fail to get
a job with such a ring of “influence,” though
many a trained super, could have played the
part better. And it has to be admitted that
the lady js an asset to the management. The
interest in her debut, worked up by social
reporters in advance, meant much extra de-
mand for seats.
“Delver” : The initial production in Aus-
tralia’s first theatre (B. 31/l/’24) con-
sisted of a tragedy from the pen of a Dr.
Young and a sketch, “The Hotel.” Spar-
row was the stage-manager, and the chief
mummers were Green, Hughes, IJawkes,
Chapman and Mrs. Davies. The prologue
was recited by George Barrington, putative

A Pair of
Sparkling
Eyes.
Every woman can
possess charm.
It is all a matter of keep-
ing a cheerful, sprightly
disposition, and making
the most of the personal
attractiveness with which,
to some extent, all women
are endowed.
The way to do this is to
guard the health.
The healthy woman,
with her lively, sparkling
eyes, welcoming smile,
and tenderly glowing
complexion, is a picture of
alluring charm. She is
happy, too, for a con-
tented body reflects itself
in a contented mind.
The easiest way to fit-
ness, happiness and charm
is the healthy Kruschen
habit, which removes the
cause responsible for both
depression and faded
looks. When you feel run
down and listless, easily
tired, it is because your in-
ternal organs are not func-
tioning properly, and poi-
sonous products are col-
lecting in your blood. Six
salts are needed to cleanse
the body of these impuri-
ties.
Kruschen is a combina-
tion of these six salts,
blended in just the correct
proportion. The little daily
dose of a “sixpenceful”
speeds up the liver and
kidneys, gently and almost
imperceptibly removes im-
purities from the whole
system, cleanses and in-
vigorates, fills the veins
with rich, clear blood,
streaming to every part of
the body, renewing health
and happiness.
Try it for yourself. Just
a pinch in your first cup of
tea every morning will
make all the difference in
the world. You will feel
fit and well, full of joyous
spirits bounding with radi-
ant health.
And you will begin to
look younger every day.

The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
just the right amount for a most
invigorating daily tonic. The medi-
cinal dose for persons suffering
from pains of rheumatism and gout,
or habitual constipation, with in-
active liver, etc., is half to one tea-
spoonful in a tumbler of hot water
before breakfast.

From Somewliere-near-the-Thames: —
Dion- Boueicault came in for some handsome com-
pliments at a dinner given by the O. P. Club to
beauteous Gladys Cooper in recognition of her having
assumed the title-role in “Peter Pan,” at the
Adelphi. His sister Kina, first and best of the
THE INHERITANCE.
“Yes, madam, you have come into possession
of some remarkable paintings.”
“Well, of course, I don’t know. The art-
dealer said a few of them were Old
Masters, but to my eye they look as
good as the others.”
Peters, represented him, and heard Gerald Du
Maurier, another member of the original cast, attri-
bute the success of the first production to Dion’s
stage management. Odd that “Peter” was played
for a week or two to half-empty houses. Then it
suddenly sprang into popularity, and every succeed-
ing Christmas revival has added to its fame.
Sessue Hayakawa, the Japanese film actor, has been
doing a gruesome playlet by William Archer: “Sam-
arai” is the name. Sessue is a top liner at the
Coliseum, hut the critics are agreed that he is not
nearly so good on the stage as on the screen. His
voice, style and appearance are all disappointing.
Florence Austral and Beatrice Miranda head the
list of sopranos for the British National Opera Co.’s
1924 season at Covent Garden. Browning Mummery,
another Australian, is among the tenors. The
most interesting feature of the season will be the
production of Rutland Boughton’s new opera. “Al-
cestis.” Boughton’s “Immortal Hour’’ has achieved
a greater triumph than any other British opera in
the last half-century.
“0.K.”: The late Mrs. William Green, so
long identified with the tuition of the young
Melbourne idea in light fantastic toeism, had
herself been taught at the best of Old Eng-
lish ballet schools. She studied at the Lon-
don theatre (it was in the City-road) where
Mrs. Conquest, wife of the original proprie-
tor and mother of his son George, the panto-
mimist, had charge of the girls. “Old” Mrs.
Conquest, as she came to be called, was an
ex-dancer with a gift for teaching, and by
the success of many of her former pupils she
made a name for herself. Teddy Royce’s
wife, who coached the “Old Guard” ballet
for the J.C.W. firm long ago, was proud to
call herself a pupil of Mrs. Conquest. Mrs.
Green, talking to anyone who was aware of
the Conquest tradition, never forgot she had
been a star pupil at the same school. To the
fact that she was an excellent teacher her
own daughters bore the best of testimony.
They were the most accomplished young
dancers the Melbourne amateur stage knew
in days when the Earl of Yarmouth did his
flutter at the Bijou; and for years after that
the unmarried Miss Green (Florrie) gave
some charming occasional performances in
public while helping to run the school her
ageing mother established in the long ago.
“Orb” : What a trier Wilkie is! On Feb.
5 he was to give a Shakspearean pastoral in
the Government House grounds, Hobart, to
be followed by a brief season of the Bard at
Hobart Royal. Then he transports his co.
to Geelong (Vic.), where they do another
pastoral “by request.” Follows a season at
the Prince of Wales’s, Adelaide, with Broken
Hill, Perth and Kalgoorlie to come after.
On Wednesday, Jan. 30., Wilkie gave his
900th consecutive performance of Shakspeare
in Australasia. Lyons’s Labor Government,
like Theodore’s, is helping him with special
railway concessions.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: As a rule, the woman
who manages a theatrical or concert enter-
prise is a temperamental star. She only
calls herself manager so as to reserve the
right to abuse' the male brute who does the
work. But an Australian woman now in
America has made a name for herself in the
role of First Robber. Ida Wiltshire started
with stage aspirations which were not
realised. Going to the U.S.A. to pursue jour-
nalism, she left it for a chance with a tour-
ing entertainer who preferred a woman to a
man as manager. Since then Ida has made
a business of theatrical piloting, and has a
recognised circuit. She is a member of a
well-known N.S.W. family.
“Tuart” : In the S. M. Herald’s account
of Asche’s farewell to Sydney the actor is
reported to have said that “32
years ago that night (January
25) he had made his appear-
ance upon his first return to
Australia.” He wasn’t in the
business then. The Dacres, of
tragic memory, gave Oscar his
first engagement at the London
Opera Comique, now out of
commission. March 25, 1893,
was the date of his debut. He
was 37 when Australia saw him
as Petruchio in “The Taming of
the Shrew” (in my judgment
his finest part), 40 when he
came back for the second time,
and he is 51 now 1 . His present
tour has occupied 17 months,
and he vows it will be his last.
Considering how his productions
have been neglected by a public
which rushes U.S. pictures and
bedroom plays, and sneered at
by ill-informed and bitter-
minded “critics,” I don’t blame
him. He will always be
heavily handicapped in Australia by being
an Australian. For an Australian to
achieve fame in anything except sport is
regarded by other Australians—troops of
them—as a personal affront.
“Santander”: I suppose there is something
in eurhythmies, but weird prancing by dam-
sels in garments which, though “classical”
in a garden, would shock a Melbourne seaside
councillor, doesn’t impress me as aisthetic.
Lots of people profess to see beauty in it,
and I have no doubt that it is healthy and
invigorating, but I prefer the educated toe-
work of a sweetly-powdered siren under the
lime. One Josie Melville or Maggie Dickin-
son, with all the illusions created by grease-
paint and finery, gives me more pleasure
than a ton of half-clad nymphs waving
well-scrubbed knees in brutal daylight. And
there is another aspect about this curious
pastime of which the American critic George
Jean Nathan can speak more brilliantly
than I. Nathan remarks with asperity that
aesthetic dancing is practised by an increas-
ing mob of wallflowers and leftovers; so he
comes to the unchivalrous conclusion that,
when a female is beheld leaping about _in
the early morn clad only in a bedsheet, it s
100 to 1 that her ajsthetic enjoyment is
subordinate to the bold ambition of exciting
a flicker of interest in the park policeman.
“Muljarra”: The Firm’s incursion into
vaudeville —Melb. and Sydney Royals are to
be run as music-halls —nearly happened two
or three years ago, when Annette Iveller-
man’s million-dahlar (or thereabouts) team
of vaudevillains arrived. They were to have
kicked off at the Sydney Royal, then newly
reconditioned, but the plans
were changed, and Musgrove
ran them at the Tivoli. The
withdrawal of the Royals
from the business hitherto
followed at those houses
will improve the situation
for Ward, particularly in
Melbourne, where the t'\\o
best theatres are under liis
control.
“Topee”: Max Vogrich
(B. 24/l/’24) first appeared
in Australia at the old Free-
masons’ Hall, Sydney, as
accompanist tof August Wil-
lielmj. Willi elm j was pro-
bably the greatest violinist
who ever visited Australia,
but his season—MacalLum,
of Brisbane, financed it—
was disastrous. The Free-
masons’, the lecture hall at
the School of Arts (Henri
Ketten played there) and
the Frotestant Hall in
Castlereagh-street were the
only concert rooms then
available in Sydney, but the
opening in ISSG or there-
abouts of the Wesleyan
Centenary Hall in York-
street retrieved the situa-
tio n. The Centennial
(Town) Hall was finished
in ’B9 and the organ opened
by W. T. Best the next
year. People wondered at
the temerity of Charles
Halle and his wife in hiring
THE BOLD, BAD VILLAIN.
“Madam, I am an act ah!”
“Well, you needn’t try to come actin' with me. I’m a
respectable woman gettin’ a’ ’onest living."
it for their concerts, but the audiences justi-
fied them. Their Australian tour was im-
mensely profitable until the Halle dame’s
jealousy of Marion Burton, the contralto,
broke up the show.
“Bulloak”: The most remarkable of all
present-day serios is the Australian Florrie
Forde. It must be 30 years at least since
I heard Florrie sing “After the Ball’’ at the
old Melb. Victoria Hall (or was it the
Opera House?), but according to all accounts
she is still headlining in London vaudeville
and looking about 25. There was a half-
circle in the “After the Ball” days, and
Irving Sayles, who was in the bones corner
with Pope, persisted in gagging while Florrie
was harrowing the emotions of the wimmen.
One night she remonstrated violently, and
the song proceeded in something like this
fashion: —
Ahf-fer the ball is over (Are y’ going to stop it?).
Ahf -ter the dance is done (Can’t you give us a
chance?).
Ahf-fer the music’s faded (You black cow!).
Ahf-fer the girls are gone (All right, pig).
Suddenly the lady let fly with a tiny flour-
bag she had concealed in her ongbongpong.
Amazing to relate, it caught Irving between
the eyes and half-blinded him, besides mak-
ing a ghostly mess of a countenance that
never required to be dabbed with burnt cork.
He hurried from the stage in search of first-
aid, and Florrie, now adequately avenged,
resumed the ditty of the cruelly-aspersed
tart
Many a breast is a-ching, if you could see them all.
Many a heart is bray-king Ahf-fer the Ball.
“ Jamwood” : The Firm’s press-agent cir-
culates the thrilling news that Cyril Ritchard
is letting hair grow south of the temples in a
noble effort to re-popularise “sideboards.” It
would be more to the purpose to announce
that the young man was engaged in a mortal
struggle with the self-consciousness which
many of us find so trying. Ritchard’s talents
are considerable, but he has irritating man-
nerisms, such as standing on one leg in the
style of a mannequin, and his naturally good
voice is so handled as to jar and become
monotonous. The impression he produces
on his audience —except, perhaps, the bobbed-
hair minority—is that he thinks too much of
himself. Perhaps he doesn’t, but of all im-
pressions made from behind the footlights it
is the one most injurious to an actor’s pro-
gress. What Cyril needs is not “sideboards”
or “Piccadilly weepers,” but hard study.
“S.T.S.”: Because a suggestion can be
more “suggestive” than a plain statement,
the moving-picture censors don’t allow any
mention to be made in a film that part of it
has been cut out; so one has to do some
brisk guessing. In a screen version of Pett
Ridge’s innocent “Mord Em’ly,” the girl has
just gone to her first situation, and the new
mistress ask sternly. “Have you your cre-
dentials on you?” The- girl looks puzzled,
and the film switches suddenly to some-
thing else. The question is never answered.
Why, then, was it ever asked ?—unless to
allow some comic answer such as “They
are at the wash.” Reference to Pett Ridge’s
book throws no light on the question either
way.
“J.H.” (London) : “Hassan,” now at His
Majesty’s, has been playing to wonderful
houses. “Capacity” works out-at £448, and
thus far the figures have never fallen below
£440 —this at a time when most of the other
London theatres have been experiencing one
of the worst slumps ever known. “Hassan”
is beautiful poetry, and has been treated
with delicate art by Basil Dean, the pro-
ducer. The only rivals to Flecker’s drama,
as far as popularity goes, are "lons or
Money,” which has earned a fortune tor
Tom Walls and Leslie Henson, and Lilac
Time.” The latter went so badly at farst
that its original promoters pulled out. But
the company found fresh backing and earned
on. To-day it is easily the most successful
musical show in London.
“Norbell” : In his reminiscences of Sydney
Criterion “Hamfat” says (B. 31/1/ 24)
“the Dacres were playing at the On. when
they decided that life had no further attrac-
tions for them.” Arthur Dacre and Amy
Roselle had been playing at Her Majesty s
under Rignold’s management, and in August,
’95, I took Dacre out to Coogee one Sunday
to see George Hill, who then owned the On.
Joe Rochester did the negotiating, and Dacre
got the house rent-free for as long as he
liked, provided he paid the electric-light bill.
The Dacres accordingly opened on September
28 in Sardou’s “A Scrap of Paper.
Harry Plimmer, Joe Tolaito, Kate Bishop,
C. R. Stanford and myself were in
the eo. We shut down after eight nights
because hardly anyone turned up to see the
best show in town. Shortly after this the
Dacres opened at the Royal in Leitch s
of the Moa,” a lurid bellowdrama which they
loathed. “The Silence of Dean Maitland
was to have followed on Monday, Nov. IS
but on the Sunday Arthur and Amy ended
it all.
“Pomposity”: Alice Rees made her debut
in “Patience” in 1881, not 1882, as stated by
“Mancam” (B. 17/l/’24). Moreover, Mile.
Andreas Novaro didn’t originate La .
June; Maggie Moore did it on Novembe
26, 1881, at Sydney Royal. There, also, on
October 25, 1882, Maggie was the first Aus-
tralian Bettina in “La Mascotte. 1 haa
seen “La Mascotte” at Paris in 1880 and a
London in ’Bl, or early in ’B2. Henry Bracy
was in the London cast. Arriving at ro
Adelaide in ’B3, I went to the Hmdley-street
Royal to renew my acquaintance wi
Audran’s delicious music. I couldn t spea
or read English then, but I understood every-
thing, thanks to Maggie’s artistry and swe
singing. Miss Moore introduced two L
bertian r6les to Australia —Ruth in Bira ■>
of Penzance” and the Duchess of Plaza
in “The Gondoliers,” the latter at Melbour
Princess’s, in October, 1890. On August
she will have been entertaining Australia
for 50 years; but surely it isn't necessary
remind Australians of that.
From Charlie Kenningham: —
If “Thersites” (B. 31/l/’24) is the person I thin
he is, I certainly told him that James Hay ‘
been a pupil of mine in Perth. It is my lmpre-
sion that he was, but I may have been mistaken.
At the time I was teaching in that city (20 y -
ago) I gave instruction to a number of promising
young vocalists. I kept no record, and I can
remember all their names; but I certainly thoug.
Hay was one of them.
NIGHT AND MUSIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night I listened to music
As one of a seaside throng,
And Life with its pain and passion
Passed by me like a song.
Ever and ever I hearkened
More than the music spoke—
Mirth of a happy people,
Grief of a stricken folk.
Dark were the towering pine-trees,
Hung were their trends with gloom,
And ever and ever the breakers
Fell with a sullen boom.
Nigh to the bright Pacific,
Scenting its salt I stood,
Magic of moon on the waters,
Magic of all in my blood.
Magic of moon on the waters,
Magic of music around,
Cornets thrilling the moonlight,
Laughter and tears in their sound.
Though deep be green mid-ocean,
Far swaying from strand and shelf,
Yet deeper the soul of music,
As the spirit of man itself.
More than the sea has music,
More than its covering wave—
Hopes that fell from the mountains.
Love that cried from the grave.
Thus in the night as I listened,
As one of that seaside throng,
Man’s life with its pain and passion
Passed by me like a song.

EVINRUDE OUTBOARD
(IDLE THE HOURS AWAY) MOTORS
Supplied with Automatic Reverse when required
FIT IT TO A ROWBOAT, YOUR
DINGHY OR CANOE
Smooth, Flexible Power for Every
Boating Purpose.
The Evinrude is more than just a power plant for a fishing or hunting boat. It makes a power
boat of any canoe, rowboat, skiff or other light craft.
Then you have quick, easy transportation, not only for fishing and hunting, but also for picnicking,
camping, pleasure riding and all other water purposes.
Women like the Evinrude not only because it is easy to start but because it is clean. There are
ho dirty oil-cups. The gasoline and oil are poured into the same tank and the lubrication is
automatic. There are no batteries, wires or switches to cause confusion. Ignition is furnished
by the Evinrude built-in-flywheel type magneto.
The Evinrude is handsomely nickelplated and enamelled, improving the appearance of any boat.
It is designed on lines of extreme simplicity and will last for years without breaking or getting
out of order.
AN EVINRUDE MOTOR on your rowboat will cut
the water at seven or eight miles an hour. Put it
on a canoe and you can make eight to ten miles.
Any canoe can be used, or any rowboat—square
or pointed stern. No special boat is needed. Your
Evinrude fits them all and is easily attached.
You can take it any place where there is boating.
The Evinrude is easily carried—weighs only 73
pounds—and is so easy to operate that
Anyone Can Handle It.
There is no weed-catching rudder to bother with—
all steering is done by the tiller handle, which
swings the entire propeller sleeve. Swing to the
right or left, and you can turn around in a boat’s
length. By a twist of the tiller handle the boat
instantly backs up—without stopping the motor.
Speed is regulated by the timer lever—a slight move
of the timer lever to right or left and you at once
get any speed within the range of the Evinrude
Motor.

Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be retumeo
unless stamps accompany.
Cassius : Passable ; but overstocked in that
line of goods... .M.P.D.: But the view the public
takes of a job does matter —matters a great deal.
In Sydney and to some extent in Melbourne vege-
table-growing was for years regarded with disdain —
it wasn’t a white man’s job. In S. Aus. that foolish-
ness was never entertained ; and there isn’t much of
it left in Sydney since returned Diggers started to
grow cabbages. .. .Paleface: Interest too 10ca1....
My Grief: Thanks, but it will have to get into one-
quarter of the space... .Neil H.: Can’t say till we
see them. .. .Lasso: Missed your aim—you didn’t
go at it directly enough. .. .S.F.G.: A tangle (f
polysyllables. This paper hates to waste space on
two syllables where one will do, and usually do
better. .. .H.E.11.: Quite right, as later references
have' shown.... Pop: The melody of it will haunt
us:—
No moods for me,
Where’er I lie.
I am a philosopher.
Of life and love,
Of joy and wine
I am a constant quaffer.
And when I die,
If low or high,
My spirit shall go thither.
I’ll worry not
But take my lot,
Nor say, my spirit, whither?
. ...J.B. (Bronte): Not quite enough in them....
E.R.D.; A little more strength and it will go
through. ... E.S. (Toowoomba): “Return” has merit,
but i-ather too slight.... F.A.R.: The yarn is all
tangled up in words. . . .Harry P.: No sort of a story
there. . . .A.J.D.: Hardly enough interest. . . .Lough-
tally : “She” might have made a small par ; the rest
are all too thin. . . .F.H.H.: It goes as heavily as a
hamstrung road-roller... .Sonia: Flutters feebly over
old ground. .. .J.R.P.: Don’t know what it means.
.... J.M. (Hawthorn) : Very few 7 people wander over the
misty blue mountains of the city in verse as faulty
as that. .. . G.A.8.; Well enough told, but not much
demand for those goods. . . .R. 5.8.: Seasickness is
about the hardest worked of all subjects of mirth.
... .Nero: You fiddled and we burned. .. .G.P. (Glen
Iris): It goes very stiffly. .. .P.R.T.: Misses by a
point or tw0.... Bellerive: Doubt if the brother bards
will do it; still they ought to be given the chance:
Thunder crashed and lightning flashed
Amidst the wind and rain,
When jilted Ned did stick he’s head
Beneath a speeding train ;
The police did shudder at the sight,
And he’s father old did curse;
You’ll all agree that’s Tragedy—
Dear brother bards, rehearse.
The pirates grappled over spoil
Upon the vessel’s deck,
When a fiend grasped a battle-axe
And gashed the captain’s neck;
They hurled a boatswain overboard
Where the tossing sprays disperse;
You’ll all agree that’s Tragedy—
Dear brother bards, rehearse.
Gory stains and dagger stabs,
Shrill cries rend the air;
He shot the villain through the hat
And the bullet killed a bear ;
He brained the miser with a spud
And quickly stole he’s purse:
You’ll all agree that’s Tragedy—
Dear brother bards, rehearse.
.. . .W.H.T.: Sorrowfully dull. .. .Ivan: Too mechani-
cal. ... E.R.R.: The offer of the verse gratis doesn't
move us. Verse on those terms is generally worth
what is asked for it....W.M.8.L.: You haven’t yet
the skill fer those little things. .. .N.E.R.: Not told
in a fashion that convinces... .II.D. (Malvern) : Don't
care for them....A.W. (Kent Town): Not w 7 ell
enough done... .M.H.H.: Not enough yarn to carry
it through. .. .C.E.W.: The finish spoils it. Can’t
you do something with it?. ...J.R. (Cairns): No
use.... Askew P.: Says old things badly. .. .Con-
stance B.: Nothing there that calls for print....
W.VV.L.: The verse is of a poor kind.... J.K.J.:
Thin little picture in lines that want better hand-
ling. . . .R.F.S.: Not bad, but not nearly good enough.
.... J.S.L.: Not interesting enough to keep us awake.
....Edward W.: The squatter’s wife is unusual
enough; but'the verse isn’t. .. .Lux: The boys walked
in at one door of the church and out at the other;
and Mrs. Briggs thought it was dreadful. Well,
we 11!... .Rogo: Only about lOgr. of interest 1o
the ton... .E.M.P.; The same old yarn told in
much the same old way. .. .Veronica M.: Most excel-
lent advice to the nations; but you forgot to tell
them to wipe their boots on the mat A.P.T.:
Whatever you have been writing in your spare time
you can make up your mind that it isn’t “poetry.”
... .Jane: Not the goods for this basket... .H.S.P. :
A few more rhymes and better scansion would help
it, but what it wants most is a little more original
thought. .. .F.V.: The intention is better than the
verse.... Gerald H.: Blank verse must be a lot
better than that.... Ragavan: They don’t make
yarns... .W.M.8.L.: The Dedication doesn’t strike
us hard enough to leave a mark G.C.T.: No use.
. ...R.W.C.: Rubbish... .J.G.S.: Poor sort of stuff.
.... Coy B.: Doesn’t get near enough to give us the
glad eye N.J.F.: Miserable attempt T.F.G.:
“Doggrel rot” isn’t a bad guess.... L.W. (Boonala) :
Not for us W.A.8.: Not much of a yarn and
poorly handled Sam T.: “Rejected” only rhymes
with “accepted” in this paper on the day after
Davidson rhymes with McGirr... .Womerah: Say -t
in a dozen lines Clos V.: Thanks, but you don’t
make any new point or throw new light on any old
one. . . .Grouch: Put it into one-fifth the space and
the right people might read it J.B. (East Melb.) :
If unused MS. is wanted, stamps must accompany it.
Not a bit of use sending stamps five weeks later.
....Five C. R.: They are not related.... Ha: West-
ralia is certainly keeping its sinking fund going
with borrowed money, but it is better to do that
than have no sinking fund at a 11... .M.E.L.: You’ve
got the atmosphere; but it’s an incredible story
C.Z.: It has been left till too late in the day....
Nitric: A good subject handled very clumsily.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS. ’
E. McA.: All gone to the crematorium... .R.R.S, :
As weak as twice-watered beer.... Jean H.: No one
could sole-and-heel those sketches K.D.: Your
grandfather chuckled over that joke... .S.H.D.,
S.V.M., K. 8., and others: Yes, we have no time for
banana jokes.... C.W.: All off the target... .L.P.:
Bad drawing shows up in hands and arms.... Bottom
Rung: Not quite. .. .C.W.H.C.: Harmless old jokes
cruelly handled.... A.E.K.: Not even the first rosy
dawn of hope... .8.C.: All scratch and no drawing.
.... J.N.K.: Has an ancient flavor... .E.C.P.: A zoo-
logical nightmare C.L.S.: Like a good little girl,
it’s going home early G.H.S.: None rings the
be 11.... J.S.: Do people really wear things like that
out your way?... .C.C.: If that idea is your own
then you must have bought it at the oldest old-clo’
shop in the world.

Insects
How to destroy them
Diseased, Plague-infested
insects are a positive
menace, and should be
ruthlessly destroyed by
using
Kruses
Insecticide
Insects of every species are “down
and but” the moment this mar-
vellous exterminator is applied.
Kruse’s Insecticide positively kills
Fleas, Ants, Bugs, Flies, Cock-
roaches, Mosquitoes, Moths, etc.;
yet is positively harmless in its
application to Dogs, Cats, Poultry,
etc., etc.
For the destruction of Aphis,
Woodlice, and other plant-attack-
ing insects, a light sprinkling of
Kruse’s Insecticide in still weather
is all that is necessary.
One tin, carefully used, lasts a
very long time.
Be careful you get the genuine Kruse s
It never fails.

sup. ft., but later the next quality realised
28s. Altogether reserve figures were ex-
ceeded by some thousands. With the log at
28s. per 100 sup. ft. it will be interesting
to watch what the dressed stuff will cost the
house-builder.

“Sturt”: A Port Adelaide man has had
bad luck. He was arrested, as James
Murphy, for a State tax which had been
left unpaid, although he pointed out that
he was James Francis Murphy, and owed no
tax at all. He finally paid under protest,
and then claimed £490 damages, pleading
that friends had seen him being driven by
the bailiffs to the local police court, and
that he had never heard the last of it. The
Court said he had its sympathy, but the rela-
tion of principal and agent between the
Taxation Commissioner and the bailiff had
not been established. Non-suit without costs.
* * * *
“Cutter” : Upon the departure of a public-
spirited local resident from a King Country
(M.L.) hamlet it was decided to present him
with a purse of sovereigns. Lacking both purse
and sovereigns, the local storekeeper, who had
been deputed to hand over the testimonial,
placed the tenner in an envelope, which was
duly pressed upon the departing citizen, with
many protestations of esteem, just before the
coach drew up. At least, it should have
been, but in the bustle two envelopes got
mixed, and it was a very angry person I
encountered on the coach. He had just
opened his prize-packet, and discovered
therein the storekeeper’s unpaid bill, with a
curt remark attached.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : Large incomes are being made
by a few Wigs at the N.S.W. Bar. but the
men in keen demand by "wealthy litigants
are only a score or so; below these
are 220 barristers mostly struggling for
any sort of business. Often these are
forced to work on credit, and months
after cases have finished they are often still
put off by solicitors who say that they have
not yet recovered costs. The barrister’s fee
is supposed to be an honorarium, which he
cannot sue for, but the pinch is being so
badly felt by some men that the Law Insti-
tute is being asked to take action. We
may yet see Parliament sensibly extending
to the barrister the machinery which practi-
cally every other worker possesses for the
recovering of his dues.
* * * *
“Ashmead” : As soon as it leaked out that
Henry Ford had the Speck under considera-
tion as the site for a branch- of his activities,
the authorities in Launceston got busy. They
sent him information about what tile north-
ern city had to offer in the State electric-
power scheme, also in shipping and railway
facilities. Next, a landholder offered to give
five acres of his hundred-odd, about three
miles from the centre of the city. The pro-
posed gift is between the river and the rail-
way, with a main road running through it,
and the tram terminus is only a few chains
away. The balance of the hundred acres, of
course, Ford can pay for out of his millions
if he likes. An alderman followed up this
with an offer of 20 acres of his 33-acre farm
about the same distance from the city, but in
the opposite direction, merely stipulating that
Ford should buy the remaining 13. It is
probable that more of these disinterested
offers will be forthcoming if the U.S. indus-
trial king decides to locate here.
■#•***
“Bloggs” on an aspect of hotel life
The cook having- left at short notice to enable the
milkman to do the right thing by her, 1 wandered
forth in search of breakfast. A spasm of economy
led me to ore of those large, dingy city pubs
frequented by the backblocker who in youth wears
violently colored shirts, and in age elastic-sided boots.
Finding that the breakfast wa's 3s. 6d., and that
the thrift scheme had crashed, I decided to get my
money’s worth. The fish had been fried the day
before, as the iron consistency of its batter encase-
ment showed. I called for bacon and eggs. The
fat, thick bacon was half-qooked. Furthermore, the
butter was rancid, the tea watery, the toast had been
made for an hour or more, and the mustard was
served dry. For the same price I could have had a
' table to myself in the dining-room of the'best hotel
in the city and been unimpeachably served with
a breakfast equal for quality, if not variety, to any
in the world. It is a mystery that people should
habitually buy the worst when for the same money,
or thereabouts, they might get the best. These sorry
old establishments in which everything is out-of-date,
from the kitchens to the cockroach-haunted bath-
rooms, ask within a shilling or so per night of the
tariff charged by a class of hotel which is eminent
for modernity and comfort. And they are rarely
without patrons to whom the saving of a few shillings
a week is neither here nor there. In other words,
Gresham’s Law applies to puhs as well as coinages;
hotels featuring ill-cooked food, dirt, gloom, slack
waiting and a hot-water service that is mostly out
of action when wanted tend to drive out those
which specialise,.in the. best of everything.
“BE A SPORT!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Come, be a sport!”—so runs the “gag”
Which makes for mischief oftentimes:
The catch-phrase of the ruddled hag
Whose thought and deed are social crimes;
The specious lie that leads astray
The silly girl or decent chap.
Bad luck to them who point the way
To “be a sport!”
A sanguine lad betrays his trust —
Bad policy tricks better sense;
Brief self-deception dopes disgust,
And folly finds a false defence.
The tempter gibes, and balmy night
Forbids a cold and keen retort;
Then silent scruples take their flight,
And she’s a “sport/'
A poison “gag” to kill fair fame;
A fallacy which flirts with truth,
Stealing from cheeks the flush of shame
That rightfully belongs to youth.
Be brave, be cautious, cunning, cute ;
But if the Devil you would thwart
Decline to eat of Dead Sea fruit —
Don’t be “a sport.”
VICTORIA.

PETER DAWSON is the kind of Scotch
Whisky which is none too plentiful to-day. It
is a genuinely old whisky, matured by time in a
natural way and mellowed in wood. Its blending
is a heritage. Its character is something by which
men who know it can identify it.
Whenever and wherever you get it, its quality
will always be the same.
A Deeply Satisfying Blend
“His Master’s Voice”
The World’s Greatest Musical Instrument.
Supreme in the musical world, “His Master’s Voice” stands, the
unchallenged leader, the criterion by which all other instruments are judged.
Its clear, rich tone, which gives to every voice and every instrument
its full natural value, neither adding to nor taking from the original
the tiniest fraction of its beauty, is the triumphant outcome of the
perfect combination of art and science.
The great stars, than whom there could be no more
critical judges, have elected to make records for it alone
—thereby registering their complete confidence in its
power to reproduce their gifts with absolute fidelity.
“His Master’s Voice” Instruments range from 1 1 guineas

Not all the relics of the Royal Australian
Historical Society are inanimate. W. A. B.
Greaves, who has been a member of the
Council of the Society from the Dark Ages,
is 95. This year he will retire, if the society
will let him.
“Sebrof” : Re queer army orders and the
Portuguese (B. 17/l/’24). A G.R.O. was
issued in France, to the effect that the
practice of referring to “our brave and gal-
lant Allies” as the “Portu-gory-geese” must
be discontinued forthwith.
“Lond.”: Another man has been killed in
England by a punch. It was in Regent’s
Park, London, and his opponent was tried
for manslaughter. Judge Swift held that
men have a right to fight, if it is done fairly;
and, finding that this was a fair in-
formal go, he gave the accused merely “the
rising of the Court.”
Tallangatta (N.S.W.) has .just buried a
man who was probably the Commonwealth’s
long-distance hermit. It is 56 years since
he selected a block of land in the district,
and lie has lived upon it solitarily ever since,
severely discouraging visitors, and endeavor-
ing to keep the whole world at arms’ length.
The ancient was S 5 when he passed out.
“Amos Manbis” : There is no limit to the
inanity of questions that may be propounded
in law courts; but the best in my long experi-
ence was fired at a witness in a Sydney
suburb recently by the officer who was pro-
secuting: “At some time during the night
were you anywhere?” The witness, a woman,
after thinking hard, replied, doubtless with
perfect veracity, that she believed she was.
“Quack”: The lazarette at Little Bay,
Sydney, is discharging lepers who have been
cured by the chaulmoogra-oil treatment,
although they are under Dond to report for
examination periodically. Half a dozen
patients have been released within the last
eight years, and in only one has the disease
reappeared. All told there are 16 patients
at Little Bay now, and for half of them
there is hope of complete recovery.
“Hamer” : The records of the N.S.W. Fair
Rents Court for 1t)23 show that plenty of
tenants hold that attack is the best form of
defence. Of the 1198 who applied to the
Court only 514 did so in consequence of noti-
fications that their rent was likely to be
elevated. In 20 instances the landlords were
awarded more than they were getting, and in
44 as much as they w r ere asking; but all the
other cases went in the tenants’ favor, in one
instance to the extent of £2 17s. 6d. per
week. The smallest rent-cut was two shillings
a month.
“Kowsara”: For the Free Giving Stakes
my nomination is Samarai (Papua), a little
island that can be walked right around in 15
minutes. Its white population consists of a
handful of business men and Government
officials, with, as a rule, a few miners who
have strayed down from the mainland fields.
Yet it promptly raised £2OB5 —£65 in excess
of the sum required—to erect a war
memorial. The trouble is to find enough
ground to erect the memorial on. Big hearts
are the only thing Samarai has plenty of
room for.
“Bildad”: Minister Oakes has decided to
strengthen the Sydney police force, so that
it won’t be banged by the push with so much
impunity as at present. I would suggest the
advisability of weakening the push, not as
a substitute but as an aid. My idea is to
make a list of offences for which one month
would be the minimum the first time, multi-
plying by two for each repetition. Unpro-
voked assault on the police is one sin I have
in view, and another is the striking of any-
body with a bottle. The present trouble is
that too many of the push are out of gaol
simultaneously.
A victim of the northern climate has just
died in Rockhampton (C.Q.) at two years
over the allotted span —James Thomas Bray.
He arrived in Australia as a baby in arms,
and on coming of age joined the foundry
firm of Burns and Twigg—and remained
with it right to the end, completing just
on 50 years’ service. And- until a fortnight
before his death he could swing a sledge-
hammer with the youngest of them. He was
in charge of some big jobs in his time, includ-
ing the erection of the Port Alma wharf, the
Pandora sugar-mill, and the first battery
at Mount Morgan.
“Huffin-Guffin” explores some dust
Western Victoria is getting ancient, too. It will
be 90 years next November since the Hentys landed
at Portland and disappeared from view till Major
Mitchell found them established in the hinterland
two years later/ The old pioneers are steadily
passing out and leaving but few written historical
records behind them. A recent lecturer before the
Historical Society found plenty of material dealing
with the early sett'em cut of Gippsland, the north-
eastern district, and the Mallee, but records of
the more remote far-western pioneering days are
very scarce. There is a quite venerable Presbyterian
church at Balmoral, but apparently the oldest docu-
ments relating to it are in the matter of its
repair 50 years ago. It is probably about the
same age as a store at Coleraine which carries the
legend “Established 1848.”
“Randolph Rentless”: In addition to being
the recipient of costly pearls, wristlet
watches, gold cigarette cases and other tan-
gible tributes, “Boy” Charlton has had a
street nafned after him in Drummoyne. It
is to be hoped that the identity of the
athlete thus commemorated has been duly
set down in the municipal records, so
that no mistake may occur in the future. In
the height of his fame Dick Cavill had a
street named after him in a Sydney suburb;
a few years later a storekeeper of the same
name, but not related to the swimmer, com-
menced business in the thoroughfare. At
this stage an indignant Bumble arose in the
council and demanded of the mayor what
insidious influences “this here Cavill” had
employed to get his name tacked on to the
street4-“and him never a member of this
council in his life!” In the face of this in-
dictment a parcel of aldermen who had for-
gotten, or perhaps never known, about the
original christening, decided that they had
only one course open to them: they wiped
out the “Cavill” and renamed the thorough-
fare King’s-parade or something to that
effect. There was only one dissentient, who.
with some vague idea of loyalty, declared
that the small shopkeeper sold the best
sausages in the district.

“I am sure I owe a great deal to
Kexona Soap. It makes the most
wonderful shampoo imaginable for
the bar, and keeps the skin in per-
fect freshness and condition.”
Miss ALICE TAYLOR.
Qirlsl The Use'
of Rexona Soap
Ensures Beauty to
Skin and Hair!
That natural beauty of skin and
hair which cannot be imitated can be
obtained by regular use of Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary
toilet soaps do not assert this influ-
ence. Many of them contain free
alkali, which tends to dry the skin
and destroy its delicate texture.
Even the best of such soaps can only
cleanse; they cannot heal and pro-
tect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same
soothing, healing, antiseptic bal-
sams as Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, the value of which in
the treatment of skin affections
is known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once
• or twice a day, and see if
it does not quickly soothe
and cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples, and leave the com-
plexion clear, fresh and velvety.

The Watcher.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEYOND the furthest desert well,
Where dusty-grey the tall palms
stand,
There is a name that none may tell,
Wind-written on the leagues of sand.
The withered horror of that place
Has filled the wanderer’s heart with fear;
Time, with the iron of his face,
Sets a hot brand upon the year.
No cool south wind, no breath of Spring
Comes ever to that voiceless plain.
The clouds have never learned to bring
The sweetness of a night of rain.
League on grey league of homeless dust
The weary stars alone have trod,
And wearier airs because they must
Whisper the dreadful things of God.
Yet on the verge of that dead land
The well is deep, the water clear;
And eyes beneath a curving hand
Have looked into the face of fear.
One dwells within a ragged tent
And waits through all unlovely days
Where the great bow of Heaven is bent
In blue above the burning haze.
A thousand leagues beyond his kin,
Facing ten thousand leagues of death,
lie sees the yellow morn draw in
With broken lips a panting breath.
He sees the yellow evening die
Across the waste of dust and sand,
Each moment like a silent cry
The ancient dark may understand.
He speaks no word of gain or loss,
His knees are stiff and will not bend,
tie breathes no prayer, he lifts no cross,
But waits and gazes to the end.
Keen as the carrion vulture’s sight,
*His desert hope the waste has scanned
To see at dawn or call of night
A moving speck upon the sand.
Who comes—what comes lie cannot tell,
But patient as the oldest star,
Beneath a palm, beside his well,
He marks how red the sunsets are.
Oceans of blood and seas of fire,
And then the trumpet of the night
Blowing through dreams his long desire,
Lifting his faith to hills of sight:
And far across the desert waste,
Unheralded by throb of drums,
A shadow that can feel no haste
Out of the oldest silence comes.
The slow stars brighten, shine and fade
And write the years on scrolls of air;
With quiet pulse and unafraid
The watcher looks beyond despair.
I know not what his end shall be;
A man’s small grave is swiftly filled.
Shall weary air have memory
Of all he hoped and all he willed?
Come glory of a grander day
Or endless night where dreams have trod,
The stars have seen upon their way
The man of science facing God!
N.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WEIGHT.
The Visit.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the garden gate clicked the
two children came flying down
the lawn, their little legs twink-
ling like beams of light as they skirted the
flower-beds. They sprang on Denison as he
came up the path, and all the happenings
of their day tumbled out in a clatter of shrill
sound while they escorted him to the door,
one hanging on each arm. Tib had fallen
out of the quince-tree and hurt her knee,
the very one that had been hurt before; a
stray dog had come into the garden through
the hole in the fence; the new ball had stuck
in the spouting of the kitchen. Yes, and
there was another Chinaman coming with
vegetables, much older and more wrinkly.
“Steady! Steady!” said Denison, as he
staggered up the steps. “Why can’t you
talk one at a time, you little ragamuffins?”
His voice had taken on the deep, resonant
tone suitable to a family man, and when
he spoke like this he always formedj! a men-
tal image of himself, large, expansive, Olym-
pian. In the hall he shook the children off
like puppies, and put away his hat and
stick. Through the sliding-doors of the
dining-room he could see the table laid for
dinner, an epergne of fruit towering up
under the shaded lights, and Maud hover-
ing round the rose-bowls with restless hands
but. placid face. Her hair had the look of
having been freshly done, and she was
dressed in a low-cut blouse that exposed her
white, plump shoulders.
“Guess who rang up to-day!” she said.
“Not the agent about that allotment?”
“No; someone you haven’t seen for years.
You’d never guess.”
Denison was half-hearted in his attempts,
for he knew the scope of Maud’s questions.
It might prove to be anyone, from her sister
Flora to the plumber who was coming to
mend the bath-heather.
“Bradley—Dave Bradley,” she told him at
last. “He’s been down on leave and is
going back.”
The news drove his own little bits of in-
formation out of Denison’s head. He had
meant to announce that Farquliar had
bought the corner-block and intended to
build a chemist’s shop, but the mention of
Dave’s name made that familiar suburban
world crumble away. Subtly his senses
were penetrated by the smell of muddy man-
grove-flats, giving out their warm breath to
a timeless afternoon sun. Pictures came be-
fore his eyes—the little station at Sedu
with it? split-palm walls, over which he had
often watched the cockroaches crawling as
lie lay awake. Yet lie only said with a
touch of brusqueness:
“Going back? Then lie’s been down some
time. Why the deuce didn’t he look us up
before? He could easily have found our
address in the telephone-b00k..”
Of course, he understood well enough his
old mate’s'reason for keeping away: durin"
the first part of his leave Dave was never
quite fit for ordinary social life. There was
no reason, though, why they should not have
met in town. While he was changing into
a more comfortable coat, there was a ring,
and the children scuttled to the door. He
heard Dave’s nervous basso-profundo laugh
in the hall and a confused babel of voices
as he was relieved of his hat and stick.
“Why couldn’t he have looked me up be-
fore?” he thought, a faint grudge sticking
in his mind like a burn. “Damn it, I’m
not so much married as all that!”
The last hint of irritation passed when
he met Bradley, though, and an air of fes-
tivity hovered about the room as they sat
down to dinner. Dave had not changed,
only grown a little thinner and sallower,
and evidences of the way he had spent the
first part of his leave still lingered with
him. There were faint red rims round his
pale eyes, and his hand shook as he passed
the salt, but the same good-humored smile
hung about his loose mouth, and something
boyish and attractive clung to him in spite
of his thinning hair. A queer chap Dave,
at home in any society, and yet never quite
at home! It was hard to believe, as he sat
there listening to Maud telling about her
trouble with the new gardener, that he was
the first white man to get to the head of
the Mambari River.
“Dad,” squeaked Tib from her table in
the corner, “why can’t we have a dog like
that fuzzy-haired one that came in to-day?”
“We can’t have a dog and a garden, too,
dear,” said her mother, “and you wouldn’t
like to see the poor thing tied up on a chain
all day.”
Don asserted that all he wanted was a
little motor-car like the boy drove about
the asphalt paths next door, and there fol-
lowed a whispered argument that was partly
carried out by small feet underneath the
table. Denison talked about his estate-
agency. He had found it hard to work up
a connection when he came down at first,
but now a lot of places were being cut up
and business was rolling in. It was only a
matter of energy and advertising.
“Don’t you think it’s time you settled
down, too, Dave?” Maud said lightly, watch-
ing her guest's fingers tremble on his coffee-
cup.
“And haven’t I?” laughed Bradley. “I’m
a Resident Magistrate now, you know.”
“Oh, you understand what I mean,” said
Maud, her maternal smile enveloping him.
After dinner he was shown the billiard-
room, its walls hung with Papuan spears,
with a large photograph framed in light oak
above each door —one of Denison standing
at the head of his squad of police-boys.
That provided memories as they went out
to smoke on the lawn, making for a corner
just out of range of the records the children
were trying over before they went to bad.
It was a mild, luminous evening, with a
faint moon showing through a veil of clouds,
and windows and doors were open in adja-
cent houses, all sorts of sounds issuing out
and mingling without discordance. In the
garden opposite a little stout man was cut-
ting his grass, and the steady drone of the
lawnmower provided a background into which
the thin notes of some girl’s voice sank,
coming out again later with renewed sharp-
ness.
“You remember Baton,” said Dave, hold-
ing his cigar with unsteady fingers. “He
was done in by one of his own police-boys,
poor beggar! They found him in a patch of
eanegrass, not half a mile away from the
station, with hardly any back left to his
head. The usual story. He’d taken risks
so often he thought nothing could happen
to him. This boy was one he’d got from
the gaol and given a lot of rope.”
“Poor old Paton !” reflected Denison. “He’d
only one fear, and that was of being eaten,
like Harding was. He’s been saved that,
anyway.”
Bradley was silent a while, and then a
queer smile wrinkled his face.
“The cooking-pot was the end of the boy
who did him in,” he said. “When he cleared
out he fell into the hands of a hostile tribe
of bush-niggers.”
From the sleeping-out balcony above there
came a clatter of feet and a shrill, protest-
ing voice:
“But I haven’t said good-night to Uncle
Dave!”
“Never mind,” Maud’s voice purred sooth-
ingly. “Say your prayers now. He’ll come
up and see you when you’re in bed.”
There was a confused mumble of words,
half-smothered in the quilt:
“Bless father and mother and all those
wc love. Bless Uncle Dave, too, and keep
us all safe from harm. Amen.”
Then Tib’s shrill treble took up some
argument that had started in the bathroom
as they undressed.
“We used to say that you’d die with your
boots on, you know, Jimmy.” said Dave, as
they walked back across the lawn. “You
gave it up just in time.”
“I’d had enough—my full issue,’’ mut-
tered Denison, tossing the butt of his cigar
into a flower-bed.
Inside they found Maud knitting a jumper
of orange silk, the light falling softly on her
bent head and firm neck. Plump, practical,
self-possessed, she seemed to fit into this
world Jimmy had built around her as neatly
as her feet fitted into the small suede shoes
that were crossed on the thick carpet. Her
eyes glanced up shrewdly from the orange
silk as she twitted Bradley about going back
alone: there was a suggestion that he was
evading something, playing fast and loose
with life, and so missing his proper fulfil-
ment. “Up there” was a world that was
right enough for young men to spend their
green years in, but it was a playground,
after all, not quite real. And at 40 one had to
be serious.
“The children started calling you ‘Uncle
Dave’ at once,” she said irrelevantly.
Bradley’s eyes were fixed on the black
pearl in her corsage—the fruit of one of
Jimmy’s trips to Goodenough Island. He
sat there with his logs crossed, thinking of
the life to which he was going back, and
feeling that it was flimsy and fugitive com-
pared with this very solid world that held
Maud and Jimmy. Could anyone doubt that
everything within these airy walls—life,
health, property, even the black pearl—was
insured up to the limit? Denison was
silent, and a little restless, inclined to let
Maud do all the talking. He wound the
heavy clock on the mantelpiece, examined
the music on the pianola, even wandered
upstairs to the sleeping-balcony to see that
the children were all right.

Every Picture
Tells a Story"
Home Again—with the
Same Old Backache!
Does every day bring the same old, nagging backache?
Do you rise in the morning lame and stiff? Drag
through the day with your back a dull, unceasing ache?
Evening find you ‘ all played-out, thinking only of a
little rest before to-morrow’s weary jrrind? Then don t
be discouraged. Realise it s merely a sign you haven t
taken good care of yourself—been overworking and
haven’t had enough exercise, rest and sleep. This has
probably strained your kidneys. So, instead of worrying, just take things easier for awhile an
help the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Then, if it’s kidney backache,
you’ll soon get over it, and the headaches, dizziness, tired feelings and bladder troubles will go, too.
Doan’s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor.
TWO INTERESTING CURES.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Thomas Spence, Harriet Villa, Park Road, Auburn, says“ For years I
was an engine.-driver on the N.S.W. Railways, and for a long time piioi to my
retirement suffered greatly with my kidneys. I think the constant exposure had
the effect of weakening these organs. The first warning I had of anything being
wrong was a pain in the small of my back. This soon began to trouble me a good
deal, and I was often so bad that I could hardly move. I took medicine of all
kinds but I got no better, and sometimes I used to wonder if ever I would be
free of the nagging ache. Well, to make a long story short, I at last .got Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they soon fixed me up, a short course banishing the
ailment completely, and I have not suffered with my kidneys since.
Four years later Mr. Spence says:—=-“1 have had no return of my old complaint
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me four years ago.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. J. Smith, Bonnie Doon Duncan Street, Arncliffe, Sydney, e say My
kidneys were in a bad way for some time and I sa _ movements
backache in consequence. I could not stoop freely; in fact, 1 J acroS s the
were handicapped owing to the nagging ache that used . t^re( j an d
kidneys. My rest at night was broken, and during the 1 y , B ac k ac he
languid, having no energy for anything. I was advised to try Doai » iving
Kidney Pills, so sent for some at once. They worked wonders in my _ • rs
relief almost immediately and gradually effecting a complete • - we ll
have elapsed since I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I have De
all that time.” , Rnck-
Five years later Mrs. Smith says“l still have great faith m s &
ache Kidney Pills. I always keep a bottle in the house, and „
little off color take a few doses, and I am soon quite all right a ß ain.

When the time came to go he escorted
Bradley to the tram at the corner, walking
down the street without his hat. They had
very little to say to one another. Denison
could not rid his mind of the faint grudge
he felt because Dave had not looked him
up immediately he had come down. How
had he spent those first weeks? In a wild
debauch, probably, ending up in a private
hospital, where lie would conduct a mild
flirtation with some sentimental nurse!
“Next time you get leave,” he said, “you’ll
have to give me good warning. There’s no
reason why we shouldn’t go for a little jaunt
together—a river trip down the Murray, for
instance.”
“I expect to see you nosing round the old
spots before then,” said Dave. “Once they
get in the blood, you know”
The tram whirled him off, leaving Denison
standing on the corner where Farquhar in-
tended to build his chemist’s shop. He
sauntered back along the street, which was
still empty, for the theatregoers were not
yet coming home. The lawnmower had
ceased purring, but there was the smell of
hoses playing on thirsty roses and hydran-
geas. Some briny shrub stirred Denison's
senses again with a memory of mangrove-
flats in the afternoon sunlight.
lie stood on the lawn, watching the flood
of soft light pour out on the grass and call-
ing up pictures. Pictures that had not come
before his eyes for years! lie was on a
raft, lying quite still, looking up at the trees
that sometimes met overhead, and trying to
forget the spear-wound in his side. They
were drifting down a sluggish, oily river,
and he could see Dave's blistered back
through his torn shirt as he paddled. Queer
how easily Dave’s skin peeled! Even in
town his hands and face always seemed to
be rough and chapped, and the heaviness of
malaria hung in his eyes. But what tough-
ness there was in his lean frame! Three
days and nights without sleep, watching out
every moment for some attack from the
bank....
“Jimmy!” called a voice from the veran-
dah.
He was too far away to reply. He was
still on the raft, moving down the long,
oily river. In the open door he could see
a white figure with the light behind it.
“Oh, Jimmy!” came the voice again.
“You’re not standing out there without a
hat, are you? You’re sure to get a cold
in the head.”
The raft struck the bank with a jolt,
leaving him on the green, cropped lawn.
“It’s all right,” he said brusquely; “I’m
coming in now.”
VANCE PALMER.
The Listener-in.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
had Inu known a day to be so
I long. Her white man had not come
near her. She had watched the
women go down to the river to wash the
morning rice, had heard the girls singing on
their way to the ladangs in the forenoon and
on their way back in the evening, and had
seen men, women and children go down after-
wards with laughter and happy cries to
bathe.
The cheerful thudding of the rice thresh-
ers came to her and reminded her poignantly
that she had no rice to thresh. The rice she
ate her white man always brought ready for
cooking in a bag from the station storeroom.
Life was hard when one had nothing to do
all day biit sit and wait for tliCi night and
listen to the sea-breezes humming through
the stays of the wireless masts. ’$
The village had accepted wireless, as it
had all previous manifestations of the white
man’s incurable eccentricity, with a complete
absence of curiosity. If the white, man liked
to put up, with immense expenditure of
energy and bad language, two huge ridge-
poles fit to make a longhouse for a raja, it
was his business. If, having done so, he
failed to put the roof on the house but left
the tall, useless things raking the clouds for
nothing, it was only another example of his
race’s incomprehensible ways. The fishing,
contrary to the village manang’s prediction,
was as good after as before the erection, and
nothing else mattered.
To Inu, however, those twin poles were
symbols. She felt their gaunt isolation as
emblematic of her life. They looked as
lonely on the windswept hill behind the
white men’s quarters as she was in her little
hut amongst the areca palms behind the vil-
lage long-house. Their erection and her seg-
regation had taken place almost at the same
time, and had made nearly an equal stir in
the little community of Sea Dyalts living in
the crowded promiscuity of the long-house
and maintaining there their tribal morality
in rigid severity. If those steel poles had
never been erected, and if her father, who
had been executioner to the raja, had not
lost his position w T itli the coming of the white
man’s law, she would now be following the
virtuous path of the other village maidens.
She would be sleeping every night in the
warm, murmuring security of the long-liouse
behind her pintu instead of quaking in a soli-
tary hut on the edge of the jungle listening
to the voices of the ghost-birds like carpen-
ters hammering a death-boat. By now she
w'ould have earned the regard of some fine
Dyak youth with a tale of heads to his name
and a reputation for vainglorious gallantry.
Going down one day to the water for the
evening bathe, she would have seen the red
flower stuck in his armlet, and in the night
she would have heard him playing the Jew’s-
harp outside her pintu and known where his
choice lay. After a period of the artless
coquetry proper to the occasion she would
have opened her mosquito-net to him. Then
as soon as the fact of her fertility had be-
come known, under the Sea Dyak law they
would have married, and she would have duly
entered the ranks of the respectable matrons
of the Sea Dyak people.
Instead of which, here she was sitting on
her own house-ladder, an outcast. Her iso-
lation was complete. The small boys of the
tribe would have repelled her with blowpipe
pellets if she had attempted to climb the
ladder of the village long-house. As for the
long-liouse of the white men, its clean, un-
picturesque rectilinearity infected her with
the same terror as her white master had in-
soired when he first came to negotiate with
her old scamp of a father for her purchase.
Her white man had been kind to her and
given her sarongs and bangles and everything
she asked for. He. had only been hard on
her when drunk, which was a thing she could
understand. What she did not understand
was why lately lie had stopped coming to
see her. She was as pretty as ever. He had
not been round the village inquiring after
other girls. Then why had he not been near
her for a fortnight?
It was the wireless. That tall, gaunt,
two-legged thing was in some mysteiious
manner coming between her and her white
man. He was always up there on the lull
in the little cabin, listening, listening: and
often he smiled.
“2 'uan,” she had said one evening, in a
spasm of jealous fury born of that mysteri-
ous smile, “what is it that speaks to you
from the air? Is it some white female
antut” ,
“That’s it,” he had grinned. Its my
turning putch, my white sweetheart!”
There he was, going to her now. Inu
watched him emerge from the quarters and
walk along the spine of the hill, his figure
silhouetted sharp and black against the crim-
son evening sky. She saw him stop and
speak a few words to the man he was reliev-
ing, who had come down to meet them. Then
he disappeared into the cabin.
She looked up at the great masts with
their crisp tracery of wires which seemed
to be for ever sailing through the sky, and
round which the stars were beginning to
swarm like fireflies; and she fancied she
could see the burning words of her white
man rushing olf into space to meet the ears
of her white rival. Her white man was
going away soon. She had heard rumors
of it for some time, but she had refused to
believe it because she could not face the
thought of being left alone. Now she began
to feel that it might be true. He was going
away to look for his white girl. That was
why he did not come near her any more, and
why he smiled and listened so much at the
wireless. He was leaving her without a
thought of her future. They would not take
her bask in the village. Some other white
man would come to relieve her white man,
and, like a slave captured in a head-hunting
raid, she would be passed on to him.
Looking up at the swaying aerials, she sud-
denly bared her small white teeth. She
would get the better of that white girl. She
jumped up and, going into the hut, took from
a battered tin trunk an ancient kris. It
was the kris her father had used in his execu-
tions, and he had often demonstrated his
methods for her benefit. Concealing it in the
folds of her sarong she went up towards the
wireless station. The thudding of the dynamo
engine kept time with the throbbing of her
heart. Walking between the legs of the
gigantic masts and round the taut, humming
stays, she climbed on to the verandah, and
looked in at the open door of the cabin.
Her white man was sitting in his chair
as usual, with those black saucers strapped
to his ears.
“Tabck, tuan,” she said, stepping quietly
inside with privileged confidence.
He nodded, without turning his head. He
was used to her evening visits, and he took
no notice now of her aimless wandering to
and fro about the room.
Out of the corners of her eyes she watched
his practised fingers moving amongst the
array of strange, shining boxes on the table,
shifting switches and turning the glistening
knobs of rheostats. He had removed his
tunic and unbuttoned his singlet. Having
finished her cursory inspection of the room,
she came to rest to the left of and a little
behind him, where, looking down, she could
see between the sunburnt neck and the
clavicle, his soft white skin dipping in a tiny
hollow which rose and fell gently with the
beating of the heart beneath it. She looked
down at the skin of her white man, the
strange white skin which had so terrified her
when she first saw it, and for a moment the
old fear came back.
Without shifting her eyes from their steady
concentration on that little hollow between
the collar-bone and the neck, she could see
her white man at his usual incomprehensible
activities, writing down mysterious signs on
paper and entering more signs in a large
book. Now and then she saw his hand drop
on to the key at his right side, and a loud,
crackling uproar, like the shriek of the argus
pheasant in the jungle, filled the cabin. After
awhile, as usual, he stopped writing signs and
began idly listening, while his hand strayed
amongst the knobs and switches in front of
him. Inu knew what he was doing. He
was searching for his sweetheart, for bis
white girl. She saw the old intent look
return to his face. He laughed and, still
with the black saucers on his ears, threw
himself back in his chair and closed his
eyes.
With a sensation of growing fury, Inu
watched the customary ecstasy spreading oyer
her white man’s face, into his arms hanging
slackly over the chair arm and down his
long legs stretched out luxuriously under the
table. Her small hand, hidden in the folds of
her sarong, closed tightly on the kris, on her
father’s kris that had seen so many execu-
tions, while her eyes remained fixed on that
little dip behind her white man’s collar-bone.
With that kris, and if it knew that spot,
a baby’s fist could find its mother’s heart, her
father used to say.
* * * *
Inu’s white man slid down out of his chair
without a sound. As ho slid his head slipped
out of the ’phones, which dropped down as
far as their connections would let them, and
there hung swinging. Inn’s eyes watched
their agitated movement subside into a gentle
oscillation. A distant singing filled the cabin
with a thin thread of sound.
Oh! AH the lights are low,
Hear a melody flow.
What’s that it’s saying?
Oh! Someone - wants you so,
With a love that will grow
While the music’s playing.
As Inu ran downhill away from the wire-
less, the voice of her white man’s sweetheart,
like the shrill piping of a Dyak nose-flute,
seemed to follow her.
In the cabin, filled with that thin ghost or
music, the abandoned ’phones swung gently
to and fro above the still face of the tele-
graphist.
