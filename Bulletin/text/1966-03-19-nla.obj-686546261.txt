MIAMBA HOCK &
MIAMBA CLARET
People who prefer their wine white choose
Miamba Hock for its exceptional bouquet
and crisp finish. Those who like a red wine
that is medium to full, with a pleasing
bouquet, fruity palate and soft tannin finish,
like Miamba Claret.
But there are many who like both white and
red, with a meal. And this is where Miamba
Hock and Claret become truly memorable
—because one balances perfectly with the
other.

Fora clean slate
Well within time limits prescribed by law, a widow with adequate probate protection
wipes her slate clean of death duties, legal charges and outstanding household
accounts. Being certain of ready cash at the right time, she avoids loss of assets
through forced sales. It is a tragedy to see an asset, built up on a lifetime of work,
sacrificed simply through lack of foresight. Without careful planning through
A.M.P.’s “Blue Chip” Probate Insurance Plan, your estate may be in jeopardy. Call
in an A.M.P. man for an A.M.P. Family Security Check-Up. This provides an auto-
matic review of your probate protection plan, free and without obligation.

187 private citizens
supervise the Mobil Economy Run
On March 22nd. next, this small army of independent observers and
officials will start a 4-day vigil to ensure that you get a true report of
what your make of car can do on a really modern petrol. These are
impartial private citizens chosen at random from many different fields.
Under the Run Director (who is appointed with the approval of the
Confederation of Australian Motor Sport and is answerable only to it),
they enforce the regulations of the Run’s 40-page rule book. They see
that drivers obey traffic laws, drive safely, stick to the route and that no
one tampers with officially sealed parts of their cars. As well as these
187 officials, many independent news reporters, television and radio
commentators, and motoring editors accompany the Run cars.
10th Mobil Economy Run Route
—1,580 miles (March 22 March
25,1966) Starts Bendigo via Narrand-
era, Orange, Taree, Grafton, Lismore,
Surfers’ Paradise, Brisbane, and
Maryborough to Bundaberg. Route
provides all types of conditions, in-
cluding city streets, to ensure a realistic
test of cars, drivers and fuel. Watch
for results. See what m.p.g. this year’s
cars can achieve with Mobil Super.

4 million horses on the job
Every working day the nation’s stable-door opens to the massive tractive
effort of its railway locomotives.
Every working day the power of four million horses is harnessed to the
nation’s needs along 25,000 miles of main and branch line track.
To a peripheral array of ports, Australia’s Railways are constantly hauling
the substance of her export greatness wool, wheat, rice, coal, ores and
concentrates.
The story of Australia’s rise to nationhood is the story of its primary
industries and of its Railways. With the coming of the transcontinental
standard gauge railway line the steel trade-routes are lengthening . . .
reaching into a tomorrow of expanded export markets . . . bringing the
promise of a more progressive, more prosperous Australia.

ONE MORE
WEEK
Not enough power
IN NOVEMBER, applications closed for
the posts of Professor-Director and Cur-
ator of the Power bequest. We telephon-
ed Sydney University last week to find
out what had happened since. We were
coldly informed that “it would be some
very considerable time before any deci-
sion was reached on the applications re-
ceived for the posts advertised.” But the
day before, a visiting art critic told us
he had heard that an announcement was
to be made “at any moment”. If we are
to judge by past performance, the Uni-
versity’s reply seems more convincing.
As a measure of what we are missing,
John Russell, of the London “Sunday
Times”, on a visit here last year pointed
out in The Bulletin that the interest
alone from the bequest could in 1964
have bought the two major 1964 exhibi-
tions of British and American art, “Lon-
don, the New Scene” and “The Respon-
sive Eye”.
Real estate
THE LANDLORD of a house in Kan-
garoo Pt Road, Sylvania (Sydney), is
suing his tenant for £5 million.
The tenant is Mr H. G. Palmer and
the company he formerly ran, H. G.
Palmer (Consolidated) Ltd, is the owner
of the house, which cost the company
£53,113.
Last week Mr Palmer’s former com-
pany, now owned by The MLC Ltd and
in receivership, announced new losses
bringing its total deficit to £l7 million.
The MLC has a mortgage over Mr
Palmer’s house, which is one of the
assets the receiver of Palmers is negotiat-
ing to sell. But according to last week’s
statement of affairs of the company, its
realisable value is estimated at only
£36,500 or £16,613 below its cost. It
will be interesting to see if Mr Palmer
manages to buy his house for less than
it cost his company to build.
This sporting life
TWO ITEMS from the pure-minded
world of sport: The NSW Lawn Tennis
Association, which made $20,000 from
this year’s Davis Cup, has decided not
to give wedding presents, worth $2O each,
to players Jan Lehane and John New-
combe, because “it might establish a
dangerous precedent”. And the Victorian
Amateur Athletic Association has decid-
ed, after much discussion, that runners
Ron Clarke and John Coyle did not
infringe their amateur status by wearing
and being photographed in singlets
with “Vita Brits” written on them.
On the principle established by non-
smoking sports stars who work at pro-
motion for cigarette companies, we think
the singlets would be OK, so long as
Clarke and Coyle don’t eat Vita Brits.
The word on pop,
THREE HUNDRED and fifty men,
women and children trooped into a
lecture theatre at the University of Syd-
ney last week to get the word on Pop Art
from “New Statesman” critic, Robert
Melville. It was a hot night and some
were licking ice-cream cones, which, the
chairman said, was very “pop”. Melville
read his paper, only interrupting the flow
to press a buzzer, signalling for the next
slide. When a slide was projected on the
screen back to front, he said: “It doesn’t
make much difference”.
Melville seemed to find it hard to take
his subject, which included a decorative
painting featuring a Coca-Cola bottle and
another about tubes of striped tooth-
paste, called “When Ad Men Became
Depth Men”, seriously. “Pop art is an
affirmative representation of the big-
city environment amusement arcades,
girlie magazines, striptease, filmstars,”
he said. “There is little comment or
satire”. Buzz: a picture appeared which
was an exact copy of a 1930 s postcard.
Melville continued from his notes: “The
artist doesn’t tamper with the subject or
send it up”. Buzz: slide showing pop
sculpture inspired by commercial pack-
aging. “I think a fully impersonal art is
emerging that could bring art into the
streets,” he said.
Praising the “banality” of pop art as
a welcome change from the “obliteration
and disfiguration” of modern art, he add-
ed: “I think we’ve had enough of Cezan-
ne’s anxiety. It’s not a matter of liking
or hating any more it’s a matter of
being with-it.” He rounded off his talk
by saying that the “weakness” of English
pop art, as compared with American, was
that it still retained a sensitiveness towards
its subject. “A very anti-art thing com-
"What'll we do this apres midi?”
pels a lot of American pop artists,” he
said. “The artist does a plan of his paint-
ing and puts it out to a design-shop to
make into a big painting. In future, I
think a picture will be produced in a
series 10 copies of each.”
At question time art-lovers asked
whatever happened to “warmth”, “spirit-
uality”, “anger”. Melville told them that
the new art was “cool” and had “no
emotion”. “Pop art is purely, but bril-
liantly, decorative. It reflects a society
that literally has written itself off,” he
said. “It seems to me we have been
through all the expressions that seem
possible. I think a nice decorative period
wouldn’t hurt at all.” Perhaps he took
heart at the thought that when he return-
ed to London he would be editing a
book of erotic art for publication this
year.
Silent poet
IN THE PRESS ROOM at Mascot a
reporter from a Sydney afternoon paper
was trying to persuade writer Frank
Hardy that Hardy’s friend, Russian poet
Yevgeny Yevtushenko, should catch a
later flight and give a Press conference
before going on to Adelaide for the
Festival of Arts. Hardy said he would
try, but seemed dubious.
After Yevtushenko landed it was clear
there wasn’t much chance. Tall, spindly
and pale-faced, the poet stood quietly
while photographers went to work', allow-
ing himself a smile when a small girl

presented him with a koala bear, which
he stuffed in his shirt pocket, and when
his interpreter, Madame Oksana Kruger-
skaya, waved her arms at the waiting re-
porters and cried, “We bring you greet-
ings on behalf of hundreds and hund-
reds”.
The questions on the trial and sentence
of Soviet writers Daniel and Sinyavsky
began to come but either Yevtushenko
didn’t hear or could not understand. His
only answer, in Russian and half-English,
was “I will not answer any questions”.
On the march from the overseas terminal
to the interstate terminal Madame Krug-
erskaya insisted, “Of course, I will ask
him any questions you like”. But even
when reporters sent written questions
into the room where Yevtushenko waited,
the poet did not bother to get them
translated. Frank Hardy apologised and
when the afternoon-paper reporter said,
“It creates an unfortunate impression,”
Hardy sadly agreed.
The barracker
YET ANOTHER Victorian sportsman is
entering the political arena. He is Jack
Dyer, the most famous Australian Rules
footballer of them all, better known
from Perth to Hobart as the intrepid
Captain Blood. Now 52, the former
Richmond ruckman is seeking ALP en-
dorsement for the State seat of Prahran.
The toughest and roughest player in
Victorian football history finds no ter-
rors in politics, or hostile crowds: “It
would be just like playing against Colling-
wood at Victoria Park. I’ve copped a lot
of hot receptions in football but they al-
ways made me go better.” What does he
know about politics? “I grew up in Rich-
mond and there were only two things
you could do in those days: barrack for
the Tigers and the ALP”.
Even if Dyer loses, the substantial re-
presentation of sportsmen in Victorian
politics will not be diminished. The
sitting Liberal member for Prahran is
Sam Loxton. former league footballer
and test cricketer.
National institution
“OZ” MAGAZINE, now a national in-
stitution rather like Sir Robert Men-
zies, sorry, Harold Holt, and Eric Baume
has now transferred its point of view
and its idea of comedy to the stage with
Sunday night revue performances at
Pact, the actors’ co-operative near Pyr-
mont Bridge, Sydney.
The result does not have the comic
flavor of the long-run court proceedings
when several members of the magazine
staff were charged with and convicted of
publishing obscenity but later success-
fully appealed against the sentence. Then
few situations have the rich possibilities
of a group, who appeared those few short
years ago to be objectionable, snotty-
nosed boys, being solemnly thought to
have corrupted the community.
The “Qz” revue comes at a time when
satire (that dirty word!) has come down
to a comedian saying “bum” on tele-
vision, so it is hardly evident now that
some years ago the magazine was the
precursor. The revue mainly shows how
quick an Oz boy’s footwork has to be
these days to keep ahead of the admiring
Alfs. Even so, once or twice the revue
traps itself. Ross Thompson does a clever
send-up of Barry Humphries, underlining
how for three hours and 25 bob an audi-
ence of Everages can feel superior to all
the other Everages. (Humphries really
seems to hit “Oz” where it hurts in the
income bracket.) But when the revue
does its own indictment of the suburban
mum they mean you to take it seriously.
The revue covers new ground only
in so far as it has quickly substituted
Harold Holt for Robert Menzies as a
prime target. Otherwise, they believe
there is a Barry Humphries, but regret it;
they do not yet believe there is a God
but they suspect that somewhere, far out
there, there is a Barbra Streisand.
Still, it’s an answer to what to do
until the Sunday film-shows come.

RUSHTON’S AUSTRALIANS...5


THIS AUSTRALIA
INDONESIA
A Djakarta Saturday
What was he now? A prisoner in his own palace at Bogor and a figurehead who
would remain President but stripped of most of his power. But President Sukarno
of Indonesia has been written off before and at the weekend his future role remained
unpredictable.
R. E. Stannard Jnr was United Press International Bureau Manager in Djakarta
until last January when he and all other American correspondents were expelled by
President Sukarno. Stannard is now a member of the UPI Tokyo staff. He reports:
It is better to speak of Saturday’s
change of command from President
Sukarno to General Suharto as a “near
climax” to the Sukarno saga and reserve
any measure of finality for some other
time when the situation is more clearly
defined. Sukarno is as wily and agile as
politicians come. He has survived more
than one attempt to unseat him. He is a
man whose make-up demands that he be
stage centre, all scenes, all acts, all plays.
Sukarno may never stop trying to
regain full and absolute power in Indo-
nesia. So long as Sukarno remains within
Indonesia’s 10,000 islands and among
its 105 million people there is always the
possibility indeed the probability
he will try in one way or another to re-
gain what he considers his God-given
right to rule. It is even possible that
Sukarno has merely delegated Suharto
to rule temporarily and to carry out
some nasty tasks such as the ban on
the Communist Party that the President-
for-Life did not want to soil his own
“revolutionary” hands with.
This latest “near-climax” in Indonesia
was brought on by what was perhaps
Sukarno’s first major political error in
45 years as a revolutionary 25 of
them spent as leader of the nation. His
error was to try to fly in the face of the
popular swing to the Right that began
after the Communist coup was crushed.
Both the Army and large segments of the
public have demanded since the coup
that the Communists be outlawed and
that Leftists be cleaned out of positions
of power.
Not only did Sukarno resist these de-
mands, but he actually ousted Defence
Minister General Abdul Haris Nasution
symbol of power for the Right-wing
forces since the coup two weeks ago
in a Cabinet reshuffle. At the same time,
Sukarno vowed he would never aban-
don his long-time policy of Indonesia’s
swing toward an informal axis with
Peking and Hanoi, and he brought an
array of Left-wing political hacks out of
the wings to fill positions from which he
had ousted other Rightists.
Observers outside Indonesia were
stunned by the announcement of Nasu-
tion’s ouster, and frankly puzzled by the
new Cabinet which seemed at best a
feeble attempt by the President to go
back to his old pre-coup game of divide
and rule. Sukarno has always displayed
a tactical intuition second to none in his
orchestration of the dozens of bickering
factions within the Indonesian body
politic. He has ruled for years by balanc-
ing off the Right-wing Army and religious
elements against Left-wing nationalists
and Communists. He even invented a
word for this, NASAKOM, which meant
rule by an alliance of nationalism, reli-
gion and Communism.
But all chance of regaining that
NASAKOM balance disappeared in the
last two months of 1965 when the Army
stood by while thousands of civilian vigi-
lantes* systematically slaughtered Com-
munists throughout Indonesia, destroying
perhaps forever the structure of cells and
cadres the party had built up over the
previous 18 years.
Perhaps it was Sukarno’s fatal blind-
ness, at least so far as retaining his power
was concerned, that he did not recog-
nise this or chose not to. The an-
nouncement of the new Cabinet on Feb-
ruary 21 brought open hostility against
the President personally into the streets
for the first time since he took over
direct rule of the nation in the late
’fifties. Thousands of students have been
in the streets virtually every day since
then, reportedly with at least the tacit
consent of the military. And Sukarno
seemed to be going farther and farther
in his excesses against them, apparently
heedless of what student opposition has
done to other Asian dictators such as
Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem.
When the students tried to block in-
stallation of the new Cabinet by massing
in the street outside Sukarno’s gleaming
white merdeka (freedom) palace, he
ordered the palace guard to fire on them.
At least five were killed or wounded.
Sukarno denounced the students, said
they were “going too far”, banned the
University Student Action Command
(KAMI) and shut down the University
of Indonesia. All he succeeded in doing,
though, was bringing more students into
the streets to invade Red Chinese con-
sular and trade offices, and the Foreign
Ministry as well. And it may have been
the raid on the Foreign Ministry that
did the major damage.
Students occupied the building for
ten hours before they were driven out,
and they ransacked it thoroughly before
they left. Even a Government spokesman
admitted that the ransacking seemed well
organised, but that many “important”
documents were missing. There was
speculation that among those documents
may have been just the papers the Right-
wing forces have been seeking ever since
the coup to incriminate Subandrio and
get him out of office.
At any rate the reports from Djakarta
on Saturday said Sukarno was standing
amid the Foreign Ministry rubble
when he gave Suharto the order
to do what was “necessary” to bring the
situation under control. That order is
now being interpreted as Suharto's call
to power in Indonesia.
THE LABOR PARTY
Prisoner in the Tower
The Opposition leader, Mr A. Calwell, is no longer a solitary prisoner in the
ALP Left wing’s tower. His deputy, Mr G. Whitlam, has joined him.
Mr Whitlam elected to join his leader
as a prisoner in the ALP tower last week
when he signed a letter to the South
Australian council meeting, scheduled
to discuss an inner executive recommen-
dation that its six delegates to the
special Federal Conference on March
25 should move for, and support, the
expulsion of Mr Whitlam from the ALP.
Mr Fred Birrell, MHR, was the bearer
of Mr Whitlam’s letter to the council.
The paragraph in the letter which mat--
tered read “I now undertake to work
within the framework of the party and
accept the decisions of its properly con-
stituted authorities”.
Up to this stage Mr Whitlam had
been confronting the Federal Executive.
He had accused it not only of being
composed of “12 witless men” but of a
variety of other ALP crimes (such as
misinterpreting a Federal Conference
decision) and other shortcomings. But
no one, not even Mr Whitlam, had


accused it of not being a properly
constituted ALP authority. A. a conse-
quence his letter to the council repre-
sented a complete surrender. It was an
acknowledgment of Federal Executive
authority. It amounted to Mr Whitlam
holding out his hands for the Left wing’s
political manacles to be placed on his
wrists.
It is quite an interesting exercise to
trace, through the official documents,
how Mr Whitlam completed the circle
since, on February 11, he wrote a letter
to the Federal Secretary, Mr C. Wynd-
ham, challenging the Federal Executive’s
decision banning further extension of
State Aid for independent schools.
Apart altogether from his TV appear-
ances (the transcripts of which the
Federal ALP Executive studied), Mr
Whitfanrs own official statements illus-
trate his circular progress. On February
15 he attacked the “extremist” group
controlling the Federal Executive. This
“extremist” group was neither represen-
tative nor responsible and “will and
must be repudiated”, he declared. He
continued on this defiant line until the
Federal Executive, on March 3, found
him guilty of gross disloyalty and de-
fiance of Federal ALP authority two
of the gravest offences in the ALP rule-
book.
At this point Mr Whitlam started to
close the circle rapidly. I must confess
that his attitude at this time left me
unimpressed. His defence of himself
before the Federal Executive (contained
in a document released on March 4)
seemed to boil down to a complaint
that Mr M. O'Brien, Federal Secret-
ary of the Australian Railways’ Union,
had once said nasty things about him
and the Executive had done nothing
about this, and that if he were to be
punished there were 14 other members
of the party, mostly parliamentarians,
who had been just as naughty as he and
should be included in any punishments
that were to be handed out.
In the March 4 document, Mr Whit-
Jam made only a fleeting reference to
the real issue involved in the present
Labor dis P ute ’ which is the subjugation
of the Federal Parliamentary Party to
Federal Executive. I am pleased
that the NSW Executive has asset led
the elected representatives of the
people should be free to dec are in
Caucus assembled their attitu es on
parliamentary action and to decite •>
majority vote without fear o coeaion
f rom outside bodies how the aims and
objectives of the ALP should e impe-

Executive, along with quite a significant
number of Right-wing and moderate
parliamentarians have put out their
political necks a long way on this issue,
Mr Whitlam has now abandoned it.
The Left are understandably jubilant.
They know that from here on the Right
wing and moderates, who basically are
more concerned with ALP machine con-
trol over the parliamentary party and
over Labor’s foreign affairs policy, are
not likely to rush to Mr Whitlam’s sup-
port again. He is too uncertain a propo-
sition to be backed consistently. The
Left wing know they have another
prisoner. Like his leader, Mr Whitlam
now has to rely almost exclusively upon
Left wing support. He cannot look
for any allies elsewhere with any confi-
dence in view of what has happened.
The Left can throw Mr Whitlam a few
face-saving crumbs. If they can persu-
ade their own sectarians to be less ex-
treme, they will tone down the Executive’s
anti-State Aid resolutions, at least in part.
Without loss to themselves of prestige or
power, they might even accept some dif-
ferent method of appointing Executive
committees. After all, there is no sense
in humiliating Mr Whitlam completely.
He might be useful for their purposes
some day. He undoubtedly has electoral
appeal and the occasion might arise
when they need that urgently. They can
afford to be tolerant and generous. They
have won as far as he is concerned. He
is no longer challenging the Federal
Executive’s authority over the parlia-
mentary party, and that is the thing that
matters to them.
They treated Mr Calwell, their other
captive, well, and it has paid off. Mr
Calwell fought strongly on thfir behalf.
On one occasion it was he that saved
the Victorian Executive, the real power
base for the Left wing within the ALP
machine, from Federal intervention
during one of the rare and fleeting
moments in recent years when the Right
wing had Federal ascendancy.
Mr Whitlam might prove similarly
valuable. He might even be useful as a
temporary replacement for Mr Calwell
in the leadership, and in the interval the
Left wing would be enjoying a good
laugh. When Mr Whitlam wrote his letter
and handed it to Mr Birrell, the Left
wing by no means was sure that it had
the numbers on the SA Council to carry
the inner Executive’s recommendation
that SA delegates should vote for Mr
Whitlam’s expulsion at the March 25
conference. They bluffed Mr Whitlam
into signing the letter. If he had stood
firm he still might have secured rejection
of the inner Executive’s recommendation
at the hands of a more representative
SA Labor body.
But Mr Whitlam signed, and in sign-
ing has joined Mr Calwell, who does not
want him as a companion, as the prisoner
of the Left wing.
ALAN REID
ARBITRATION
Hawke and the Bench
The daily grinding and hammering of the voice of Mr Bob Hawke, advocate for
the Australian Council of Trade Unions, was interrupted during the Arbitration
Commission hearing in Melbourne last week, for the sake of an application and an
apology.
Mr John Patterson, Research Officer
for the Australian Council of Salaried
and Professional Associations, applied
for leave to make a separate submission
to the Bench in the present basic wage
case. In the process he apologised for
statements made in the “APSCA News
Sheet” last year after the hearing of the
national wage case.
Mr Patterson may have been a trifle
fortunate to escape with an apology.
The “APSCA” article refers to the 1965
judgment as “a sloppy piece of work”,
claims that it was “very loosely worded
due to deficiencies in drafting”, alleges
that “the most distasteful element of the
judgment was the ruthless disregard for
(previous) commitments”, accuses the
majority of the 1965 Bench of being a
“cabal which finds itself in the ascendant
and has no such scruples”, charges “the
dominant cabal of judges” with being
“so insecure in their new-found power
that they threw caution to the winds, and
disregarded all previous undertakings of
the commission”, as well as spraying
around the epithets “revolutionary junta”,
“law of the jungle”, “complete lack of
comprehension”, “conscious nastiness”
and “incredible nonsense”. As a parting
blow it remarked that “the advocates
might as well have addressed the three
wise monkeys”.
All is forgiven, however, if not for-
gotten, and Mr Patterson’s claim is being
considered by the Bench as we go to
press. In any case he will not cut into
much of the two weeks or so which
Hawke needs to present the ACTU case.
The fast-talking Hawke (in three separate
timings I clocked him at 150, 170 and
180 words a minute) is asking the Com-
mission for a basic wage increase of
$4.30 and a margins increase of $5.90.
The crux of the union case is that
real wages should be assessed on both

“the significance of the goods and ser-
vices they enable the wage earner to buy”
and “the increases in the actual output of
goods and services per head in the
economy”. In other words, wages should
be based on the formula of “wages plus
productivity”.
This principle was more or less
accepted by the Bench in 1961 when the
decision was made that the Commission
would each year adjust wages to main-
tain their purchasing power, and that
every three or four years it would see
if increases in productivity justified a
rise in real wages.
Last year, however, by a majority of
three to two, Justices Nimmo, Sweeney
and Gallagher crushed this emerging
tradition and, stating their disagreement
with the 1961 decision, adopted the
simple principle of “the capacity of in-
dustry to pay” as the key factor in
determining wage and margins cases.
They refused to increase the basic wage
but granted a one and a half per cent
increase in margins.
On the Bench now sit Justices
Gallagher, Moore and Wright and Com-
missioner Winter. Mr Justice Gallagher
was a member of last year’s majority
which turned down the union’s basic
claims; his greatest concern to date has
' been with the possibility that wage rises
lead immediately to price rises. Mr
Justice Moore has hitherto accepted the
union case of “prices plus productivity”
as the determinants of wage increases.
Mr Justice Wright and Commissioner
Winter are known to have been sympa-'
thetic on a number of occasions to the
views held by Mr Justice Moore.
No doubt, with the above in mind,
Advocate Hawke has so far concentrated
on directing his arguments against the
views last year adopted by Mr Justice
Gallagher: “With respect, Your Honor,
I do not believe that the actual words
and implications of the 1965 majority
judgment sit easily with what Your
Honor has said on other occasions.”
Hawke is anxious to get the Bench to
accept the idea that the 1965 judgment
was in principle opposed to the whole
history of the Commission and was also
not a satisfactory application of the
powers granted the Commission by Com-
monwealth legislation. He is concen-
trating his attack on the notion that some
members of the Bench appear to have:
that the Commission is a kind of
“economic sub-legislator” with the re-
sponsibility to achieve price stabilisation.
The basic difficulty with this case is
the rather ambiguous nature of the Act
constituting the Arbitration and Con-
ciliation Commission. The Commission
is set up to “settle disputes”, etc., but the
Act also refers to the “interests of society
as a whole”. Thus some judges have
interpreted their role as that of establish-
ing industrial peace through social
justice, and others have leant in the
direction of trying to protect the
economy (and, perhaps, those who do
not benefit from basic wage rises) from
price rises and inflation.
The ambiguity in the constitution of
the Commission has now led to a situa-
tion where judgments depend rather too
much on just who is appointed to sit on
the Bench in any given year. This year
the odds favor the ACTU and Mr
Hawke, and most large employers of
labor are preparing for substantial rises
in their wages bills in June.

of progress payments began to dry up,
hard-pressed businesses immediately
started suing. The current upshot, as
observed by a visiting American, is “a
case of near-panic in the West Austra-
lian business world, which is desperately
short of ready cash”. This potentially
explosive situation was also in the mind
of John J. Peers project manager for
Keltec (Aust.) Pty Ltd, who have won
the contracts for the high-frequency an-
tennas he has warned that the unrest
could trigger “a dangerous chain reac-
tion of litigation” .. . and needlessly.
His aim was to reassure: “Many
business firms are unaware of the safe-
guards built into the contracts under
which we are performing,” he said.
These entailed bonds against failure to
perform the contracts or to meet com-
mitments, with indemnification by big
American insurance firms ‘ln other
words,” said Mr Peers, “everyone in-
volved from the smallest sub-con-
tractor right up to the US Navy is
fully protected by these insurance groups
against failure either to do the work or
to pay their bills. If this were thoroughly
understood throughout the business
community, there could be no possible
cause for alarm.”
This bonding, he said, was insisted
upon by the US Navy; since the risk was
something like a $150,000 premium
against the $20,000,000 prime contract,
it could be assumed the bonding house
was sure of the clients’ credit-worthiness.
However, a visitor associated with the
project added wryly: “Someone back in
the States is going to pick up a mighty
big tab when this job is finished”.
The reassurance was confirmed by the
US Navy, who have privately given the
same advice to such organisations as the
WA Chamber of Manufactures, which
has been concerned at the trend of
events following tardiness in payments.
The Navy spokesman, however, pointed
out that while everyone would get his
money, there might be delay by conflict
over amounts owing.
DON LIPSCOMBE
VIETNAM
Commitment
The day after Exercise “Caesar
Augustus” ended last week for the men
of the Ist Field Regiment, Royal Aus-
tralian Artillery, Exercise “Ben Tiger”
began for the sth Battalion, Royal Aus-
tralian Regiment. Both units will be in
Vietnam later this year.
They will make up a large part of
the 4350 Australian Army personnel to
go to Vietnam.
“Caesar Augustus” was designed to
test gunners and how to deploy them and
their equipment quickly by RAAF


Iroquois helicopters. At least nine of the
helicopters will be joining the task force
in Vietnam. The exercise was held in the
heavily wooded country around Tian-
jara, near Nowra, on the south coast of
New South Wales, and went on for two
months. In that time the 400 artillery-
men practised night firing, patrolling and
defensive fire plans. Helicopters flew
105 mm. howitzers and men into
positions, targets were shelled and then
the units were quickly flown out again
before the “enemy” could detect their
positions. In April, the unit, which in-
cludes nearly 100 national servicemen,
will go on to final intensive jungle train-
ing at Canungra, Queensland.
In “Ben Tiger” the infantrymen of
5 RAR this week have been going
through phase one of a three-phase ex-
ercise based on the kind of combat con-
ditions expected in Vietnam, or at least
as close as conditions in the Great Divid-
ing Range can ever be to Bien Hoa.
In phase one the’ troops are securing
the landing strip at Gospers, 75 miles
north-west of Sydney.
In phase two, known as Exercise
“Iron Lady”, the troops will resist an
enemy attack on the strip. RAAF Cari-
bous will supply the infantrymen and
Army Cessna light aircraft and Sioux
helicopters will provide reconnaissance.
This phase of the exercise will end with
a battalion attack on an enemy base with
RAAF Sabre jets simulating air support.
Although 5 RAR will be airlifted back
to base at Holsworthy after this attack
on March 24, phase three will be of
considerable importance to the unit and
all other troops in the Vietnam task
force. Known as “Hounds Foot”, phase
three will be to give the staff of task force
headquarters practice in the control
and administration of a force of several
battalions with supporting arms and
services and test the communications for
the control of the force.
In addition to 5 RAR and the Ist Field
Regiment, RAA, the 6th Battalion, RAR,
based at Enoggera, Queensland, will make
up the main combat units of the force.
The following units will also be involved
either complete or in part. (The propor-
tion of national servicemen overall in
the units is about one in three.)
® Headquarters, Ist Task Force (Hols-
worthy).
• 131st Divisional Locating Battery,
RAA (Holsworthy).
9 Ist Field Squadron, RAE (Engineers)
(Casula, NSW).
• 17th Construction Squadron, RAE
(Engineers) (Randwick, NSW).
• 30th Terminal Squadron, RAE (Ship
loading-unloading) (Mosman, NSW).
• 103rd Signals Squadron, Royal Aus-
tralian Signals (Ingleburn, NSW).
• 130th Signals Squadron, Royal Aus-
tralian Signals (Mosman, NSW).
• 3rd Special Air Services Squadron,
Royal Australian Infantry, (Swan-
bourne, WA).
• Headquarters, Ist Company, Royal
Australian Army Service Corps
(Logistic Support) (Ingleburn, NSW).
• 176th Air Despatch Company,
RAASC, (Marrickville, NSW).
• 2nd Field Ambulance, RAAMC,
(Puckapunyal, Victoria).
• 33rd Dental Unit, RAADC, (Hols-
worthy, NSW).
• 2nd Composite Ordinance Depot,
RAAOC, (Wodonga, Victoria).
• 101st Field Workshop, RAEME,
(Electrical-Mechanical Engineers) (Ing-
leburn, NSW).
The annual cost of maintaining the
task force in Vietnam is estimated at
$24.6 million, an excess of $6.6 million
over the cost of maintaining a similar
force in Australia.
Although non-military aid to South
Vietnam has not cost Australia nearly
as much, it has been long-standing and
will be increased. Consideration is being
given to expanding some of the projects,
particularly those which Australia has
already been able to carry out success-
fully. Recent aid to South Vietnam
under the Colombo Plan has included
a 50kw. transmitter for Ban Me Thuot,
trade school equipment for Nha Trang,
school supplies and the training in Aus-
tralia of 39 Vietnamese students.
Expenditure in 1964-65 under the
Colombo Plan was $400,000. Australia
also assists South Vietnam under the
SEATO treaty, providing telecommunica-
tions equipment, road-building equip-
ment, blacksmiths’ sets, blankets, galvanis-
ed iron, barbed wire and tents. Tn 1964-
65 the value of Australian civil aid to"
South Vietnam increased to over $2
million.
One of the major current projects is
the continuation of an Australian surgical
team at the provincial hospital of Long
Xuyen. 100 miles south-west of Saigon.
Originally an eight member team in
October, 1964, the team has grown to
nine, consisting of two surgeons, an
anesthetist, a medical registrar, two ward
nurses, two theatre nurses and a radio-
grapher. The team is also training Viet-
namese in the operation of a blood bank,
nursing and anesthetics.
An engineering team of five members
based in Saigon is setting up a town
water supply system at Bien Hoa in a
co-operative enterprise with the Viet-
namese and Australian printers will
publish one million copies of three science
textbooks for primary school children.
It is projects like these which will he
expanded as non-military aid to South
Vietnam is increased.

Charlie Can Wait 20 Years
Extracts from a Vietnam Notebook
By PETER COLEMAN
It is one of the anti-Chinese national
days when we arrive in Saigon, and
the sirens are blaring somewhere in
the next block as police escort General
Ky away from the celebration. The
day commemorates two heroic girls who
saved Vietnam from the Chinese 2000
years ago. Next week, someone says, a
corrupt Chinese speculator is to be pub-
licly shot by a female firing squad as
part of the Government’s anti-corruption
drive. Women will do the job because
it was mainly women that he exploited.
The Vietnamese may not love Americans
or any foreigners, but, as they say,
Chinese eat rice: the Americans want to
go home as soon as they can but the
Chinese will be there forever.
Saigon is a war city. The women—
surely the world’s most beautiful in their
ao-dais —loose silken pyjamas under
panels of silk hanging from tight bodies
■—walk or cycle, as if everything were
normal, along the boulevards between
the choking traffic, but most men carry
a gun and our car windows are open by
an inch only. This is to prevent some-
one passing on a motor bike and drop-
ping in a hand grenade. Probably not a
necessary precaution, we are told, but
these things happen from time to time.
There are Americans and American
jeeps everywhere but few American flags
and countless Vietnamese flags. The
Americans insist down to details that
they are assisting a foreign government,
and, unlike the French, support Viet-
namese nationalism. It is still a French
city in its architecture and roads, and
most of the foreign signs are in French,
not English. But it is overcrowded and
services are breaking down, piles of gar-
bage spoil the boulevards, electricity
breaks down, you cannot get a single
room in any hotel, and “snack bars”
with names like Kelly’s, San Francisco
and Crazy Club are everywhere. This
is the “brothel economy” the nationalists
complain about.
IT is also a brilliantly argumentative
city, as we realised at dinner, to the
echo of explosions in War Zone D. It
would be an overstatement to say the
mood is optimistic. The Viet Cong are
losing; we are not yet winning—this is
as far as the new optimism goes. Milit-
arily, North Vietnam is being beaten, Viet
Cong morale is falling, the quality of its
key cadres is declining, but it is not yet
surrendering in large units and its main
force and hard-core are still intact. North
Vietnamese reinforcements, particularly
during the Christmas bombing pause, and
Viet Cong conscripts are matching the
US build-up and North Vietnamese
cadres are taking over the Viet Cong
operations. If Charlie can’t win, he will
try to outwait the Allies. (Charlie is the
Viet Cong.) They are prepared to wait
20 years. Hence the case for escalation,
to increase the US commitment quickly
to over 500,000 men, to destroy the
enemy main forces, eliminate Viet Cong
terror and drive the Viet Cong rem-
nants to small pockets as in Malaya.
But the political war is another matter.
How do you get political life among
the 70 political parties and the religious
factions? The optimists point to last
May’s provincial election in every South
Vietnamese province, when in clean elec-
tions 50 per cent of potential voters
elected local councils. Others claim
that stability must precede politics and
look to the pacification programme under
which about 60 teams of about 600-700
armed rural construction specialists will
follow in the wake of the Army, mop up
Viet Cong remnants in the villages and
launch health, education and other local
government services.
WHY do the Communists have all the
best words? They “liberate” villages, we
“pacify” them, that is, introduce peace
and good government. They have
“guerrillas”, we have counter-insurgency
specialists.
Even so, the guerrillas are beginning
to defect on a large scale and I asked
one of the Americans, who spend days
interrogating them, what was the main
factor influencing defectors. Undoubtedly
American air power, he said. The
turning point was the introduction of
B-52 bombing in the middle of last
year. When a reconnaissance plane has
spotted the Viet Cong, bombers can be
there in a few minutes. They fly too
high to be seen or heard, and the first
thing the Viet Cong knows is that the
earth explodes and the deep underground
bunkers and tunnels that have been safe
for years are devastated.
VTou soon learn to balance one expert
off against another. A military ex-
pert now scorns the political specialists
we met yesterday. Forget about the
provincial elections; they mean nothing.
Forget about the 70 so-called political
parties and the problems of getting them
to work together. They are insignificant
handfuls of people, only good for worth-
less Ph.D. research. The only thing in
Vietnam that is anything slightly like a
political party is the Communist Party
and it is a terrorist army. The real
parties in South Vietnam are the four
Army corps; the coups are elections;
the Buddhists and Catholics are civilian
arms of the various generals, not signi-
ficant, independent political forces: when
they begin to agitate, ask what general
is manipulating them.
WE cannot fly to Hue, the old capital
just below the North Vietnam border, as
the ceiling is low and there is too much
anti-aircraft fire. We stay further south
at Da Nang, the site of the great Marine
base. General Thi has just sacked the
mayor for corruption. One expert says
he was undoubtedly corrupt; another ex-
pert says this is rubbish, he was'sacked
because in a fit of commonsense he had
ignored General Thi’s xenophobic order
to remove all “foreign” (that is, Ameri-
can) signs from the streets.
We drive through a refugee settle-
ment. There are now about 800,000
refugees from the Viet Cong, scattered
up and down the coast, around Saigon
and in the Delta. They make up one
of the biggest migrations of population
since World War II and the biggest since
1954 when 1,000,000 North Vietnamese
fled from the Communists. They are
refugees from Viet Cong terror, taxation,
conscription, and plunder. Their plight is
as pathetic as anything in Vietnam. The
Government gives most of them a few
piastres and a kilo of rice a day and
more or less forgets them.
In Da Nang we join Colonel Serong
of the Australian Army, now with US
Operations Mission. On the way with
him to Dalat, the highlands centre where
he is training the Police Field Force, we
stop at Kontum and we drive out, armed,
to an orphanage and a lazaret.

in charge of each an envelope of money
collected by the members of the Colonel’s
parish in Melbourne. As we leave the
lazaret, an Irish priest tells the nun
she has two minutes in which to tell
the Australians what she most needs in
the lazaret. After about three minutes,
she says: bicycles, so the non-leper
children of lepers can ride to die distant
school.
At Dalat, Colonel Serong explains the
concept of the 15,000-man Police Field
Force. When the Viet Cong are driven
out of a village, you cannot put in teach-
ers, doctors, policemen to get peaceful
life going again, because as soon as the
Army leaves the Viet Cong would return
and cut their throats. But the Army can-
not stay put. What is needed is teams of
para-military field police which will
patrol the village indefinitely, protect it
from a Viet Cong return, and prepare
the village for the “pacification” teams
which will launch routine peaceful
government. The field forces have be-
gun work and are operating “absolutely
according to the concept”.
TUe drove the 50 miles from Saigon to
" the Australian battalion at Bien Hoa
the hard way—at first slowly trailing a
US Air Force ammunition convoy, and
then through a disused rubber plantation
along a Viet Cong road, which, we are
told, they only use at night time. There
was presumably no serious risk, but it
was good to reach the canteen.
Although the battalions main job is
not to “search and destroy” but to pro-
tect the US base at Bien Hoa, they had
just finished their 22nd operation with-
out being ambushed once. At lunch (in-
cluding crab and Californian wine) they
ridicule the regular publicity that they
are so much better than the Americans.
They say they are not (or not
much ...!), and in any case the pub-
licity makes life hard for them when
dealing with the Americans. They have
a completely good-humored indifference
to Australian critics of our commitment
to Vietnam.
How do you explain the pride you
feel at the Australian battalion’s base at
Bien Hoa? It is not that the men are so
professional and competent —only the old-
fashioned still undervalue the Australian
Regular Army. They are simply a
thousand of the best men Australia can
produce—with way above average skill,
intelligence, humor, courage. It is as if
the legends we flatter ourselves with have
some truth in them after all.
In fact the Australian commitment
in all departments is of way-above-
average people—the Embassy officials,
the surgical team, the RAAF. It is as
if, since our effort is a small one, we are
making sure it is excellent.

at Bien Hoa we again take the jeep
slowly through the township, rifles cocked.
The hospital is small but one of the bet-
ter ones in South Vietnam. Wives, chil-
dren of the Viet Cong victims, wait beside
the bed and sleep in the hospital. They
often have to give blood for their rela-
tives, even if it is the wrong group. Blood
is one of the worst problems. Many
Vietnamese, suffering from anaemia,
from malaria, malnutrition would be un-
satisfactory donors, and if the hospitals
got enough blood, there are not enough
trained pathologists or nurses to classify
and look after it. Even if there were,
there are not enough reliable refrigerators
or reliable electricity supply to keep it at
the right temperature. But the need is
so great there is surely a way Australians
could help by supplying blood, patholo-
gists and electricity generators for the
main hospitals.
An interview with Prime Minister Ky.
He has had the reputation of a young
playboy aesthete, the handsome stunt
pilot with jewelled pistols and the
permanent bowl of roses. In Saigon
everyone tells us he has changed and
is now committed to both victory and
reform. He lives modestly and shuns
relatives to avoid any hint of nepotism.
The regular word is “sincere”. I can
only report it seems true. He was con-
servatively dressed (dark, well-cut suit
with white pocket handkerchief); and
there was a bowl of roses but, contrary
to what we had been advised, we did
not have to talk about them. He speaks
slowly, as if his English, which is good,
comes hard. He uses the word “mister”
instead of “sir” the way some people
might use the word “doctor” or “pro-
fessor”. When he said “I am not getting
anything out of this. I want to do some-
thing for my country”, the banal words
seem simply true and impressive. We
talked about the war, the refugees, paci-
fication, but he came most to life when
we mentioned negotiations. There was
a long pause, then he leaned forward,
paused again and said slowly: “I will
tell you one thing . . . mister. No one
in the world [does he mean President
Johnson?] can persuade me to sit down
and negotiate with the Communists. I
would have to be killed ... I have
been fighting them all my life . . . since
I was 15 in the North ... I come from
the North. ... It is [with great
contempt] ridiculous.”
Suddenly changing the subject he asked
about the horses. Horses? “Yes, the
Australian horses I have been asking for.
Your horses are so beautiful, so well
trained. They would be perfect for
ceremonial occasions in Saigon. I keep
asking for them but you keep putting it
off. If you don’t give them to me I
will have to get them from Thailand . .
Holt’s First Month
The new techniques
By ALAN REID
A Prime Minister is like the con-
ductor of an orchestra. As gov-
ernment has to go on, the music
generally has to be the same. But the
way he wields his baton and uses his
players decides the tonal quality
The Holt Government has now been
in power for just over a month. It is too
early to judge whether it is going to be
a good or bad administration. But al-
ready it is emerging that it is going to
be a different government due to the
way in which the conductor Prime
Minister Mr Harold Holt is wielding
his baton.
Holt, 57, scion of a family with thea-
trical associations, a skindiver. fit, good
natured, a man who in his day has en-
joyed his flutter on the turf, a modest
drinker and a prodigious worker, is cast
in a quite different mould from his pre-
decessor, 71-year-old Sir Robert Men-
zies who in the J 6 years since 1949 has
dominated the non-Labor side of Federal
politics.
Where Menzies was a “loner” who
sought advice sparingly and acted on his
own intuitions and judgments and who,
even at his most tolerant, manifested his
impatience with colleagues, including
members of his inner Cabinet, by means
of a sarcasm that reduced them to a
feeling of hopeless, fumbling inadequacy,
Holt is a team man. He seeks advice,
and listens to it. Where Menzies domi-
nated any discussion or argument from
the outset, usually with his mind formed
before the discussion got under way,
Holt is prepared not only to hear the
views of others, but to weigh them be-
fore reaching a judgment.
Oddly Holt could have acquired this
approach from the former Labor Prime
Minister Ben Chifley, who always ar-
gued that government by one man,
however wise, was inferior to the gov-
ernment of a wise man who had coun-
sellors, even if some of those counsel-
lors were fools, because even fools on
occasions could talk sense or produce a
viewpoint that was worth considering.
Holt, though anti-Labor throughout his
life, has never disguised the fact that he
got valuable political advice from Labor
personalities For example, he still fol-
lows the advice given him by the late
John Beasley, one of the senior Minis-
ters in the Curtin and Chifley Labor
Governments, that when asked some-
thing at Question Time in the House of

Representatives (the testing time of a
Minister’s quality) you answer the ques-
tion—whether flippant, hostile, or embar-
rassing as though it were a serious
search for knowledge or enlightenment.
In this way, Beasley told him, you avoid
traps, and by adhering to that advice
Holt had kept out of the innumerable
traps that have been laid for him in a
political career that now goes back to
1934 and a Ministerial career that has
been unbroken since the Menzies Gov-
ernment came to power in 1949.
It would be silly to suggest that Holt’s
Ministerial colleagues did not regret the
passing from the political scene of Sir
Robert Menzies. Ministers and parlia-
mentarians have a vested interest in re-
maining Ministers and parliamentarians.
Menzies was the man who for 16 years
led them to an unrivalled succession of
electoral victories. No party likes to see
a leader who can produce that type of
performance, and continue to produce it,
depart from the scene. But there are
signs that the Cabinet is a happier, less
inhibited group since Menzies decided to
retire.
Comparative happiness
HPhe Cabinet members know now that
A if they express an opinion across the
Cabinet table they will not be cut down
with withering sarcasm if it does not find
favour with the man at the head of the
table, nor are they torn to pieces with
the same savagery in the Cabinet ante-
room (where Cabinet post-mortems are
held while Ministers dispose of a few
drinks after a torrid talking session).
Hok accepts that they are entitled to put
an opinion and that they put forward
their opinions for consideration, not in
hostility, and that their opinions should
be respected and weighed, even if finally
they are overridden.
This feeling of comparative happiness
exists despite Holt facing, immediately'
on his elevation to Prime Minister, a
swag of problems of unusually heavy
proportions. He was confronted with the
prospect that the UK, carrying a defence
burden that it found insupportable,
might decide to withdraw as a military
force from everywhere East of Suez, in-
cluding the Malaysian and Singapore
area. He had to negotiate with the UK
Secretary of State for Defence, Mr
Healey, against a background that if the
right to the use of bases by the British
in Singapore and Malaysia were with-
drawn by the Malaysian and Singapore
Governments, Britain believed that it had
no alternative to withdrawal to Metro-
politan Britain unless Australia was pre-
pared to provide bases on the Australian
mainland.
He had no sooner got over that hurdle
successfully (Britain has decided to stay
in South East Asia and Australian-UK

nam. With the US stepping up its efforts
there, Australia was requested to make
a matching gesture, and US Vice Presi-
dent Humphrey was sent to Australia
a pressure upon Australia to act.
Then on top of that came the Dawson
by-election in which the Labor candi-
date, Dr Rex Patterson, captured that
Queensland seat, for years a Country
Party stronghold. It was from the Gov-
ernment’s viewpoint a shockingly handled
campaign. Patterson, a former director
of the Division of Northern Develop-
ment in the Department of National De-
velopment resigned in disgust and distress
at the Government’s lack of thrust over
northern development. If there was ever
a tailor-made candidate for a particular
electorate Patterson was he He was con-
testing a seat in which there were deep
grievances against the Government for
their inertia over northern development.-
He had sacrificed a well paid, assured
job in the Public Service and an even
higher paid job with the UN so as to
turn northern development into a public
issue.
But the Government despite the ob-
vious divisions in the Labor Party which
had a deeper national significance even
than northern development for they in-
volved external affairs policy and even
possibly Australia’s future survival as a
nation) allowed the contest to develop
into one between Patterson and the Gov-
ernment’s candidate —R. J. Fordyce, CP,
a sugar farmer—and Patterson walked it
in, and is now sitting in the House of
Representatives confronting the Govern-
ment directly instead of on the hustings.
A British base
TTolt —to ms credit —grasped all the
nettles firmly. He told the UK that if
the need arose it could have a base in
Australia As there is still in this country
a strong undertone of pro-British senti-
ment. this did not present the same poli-
tical problem as had the Government’s
decision to agree to the establishment of
a US radio communications base at Ex-
mouth Gulf a decision which split the
Labor Party down the centre and is still
bitterly resented by a formidable Labor
group both in the Parliamentary Labor
Party and in the ALP machine.
He announced that the Australian
commitment in South Vietnam would be
trebled, and that Australia would have
4,500 men there by June, many of them
compulsorily recruited national service
men. Holt, a perceptive man, with
an intuition about politics .hat rarely
leads him astray, must have realised
that there were political dangers in
this. The issue of the use for overseas
military service of compulsorily recruited
men split the country in the 1914-18
war and was a major issue in
World War 11. Holt must have wondered
what would be the reaction to compul-
sorily recruiting men for overseas mili-
tary service (in which the rate of casual-
ties for the 1500 professional service-
men already in South Vietnam has been
dauntingly high) during a period when
Australia officially was at peace and for
participation in what, for the nation as
a whole, is still a part-time war.
But Holt made the decision firmly and
was just as firm in rejecting the propo-
sition made by the leader of the Opposi-
tion, Mr Calwell, that there should be a
referendum before national servicemen
could be used for overseas service. Holt
was quite frank in stating his reasons for
deciding to send troops to South Viet-
nam. “Our own national security de-
mands this course,” Holt said. “We cannot
be isolationist or neutralist, placed as we
are geographically and occupying, as we
do, with limited national strength this
vast continent. We cannot leave it solely
to our allies and their national ser-
vicemen to defend in the region the
rights of countries to their independence
and the peaceful pursuit of their national
way of life.” He was similarly frank
about his reasons for not having carried
a referendum before national servicemen
could be used for overseas service. He
did not see the position as analogous to
that existing in World War I. Then men
would have been sent overseas for ser-
vice for indefinite periods. The service-
men who would be serving in South
Vietnam would spend 12 months training
in Australia. They would then be liable
for service only for a limited period a
year.
It is in part this frankness that dis-
tinguishes the Holt regime from the
Menzies period. Menzies always played
his cards close to his chest. An accusa-
tion made against him and it was
often justified was that he took
neither the Parliament nor the people
into his confidence. He could crystallise
issues to an extent that Holt as yet can-
not and probably never will be able to.
But he would not explain motives or
reasons. Holt, on the other hand, seems
determined to take both the people and
the Parliament into his confidence. He
explains why his Government is doing
things as well as announcing what they
propose to do.
This might be a more dangerous po-
litical pattern of operations than the one
Menzies followed. If you do not explain
there is always more room for subse-
quent manoeuvre if things go wrong.
Explanations also give the electorate the
credit for a degree of sophistication that
possibly is not justified. Whether i|
proves a successful or unsuccessful tech-
nique remains to be seen.
Holt also has a different administrative
technique from his predecessor. Minis-
ters pften complained during the Menzies
regime that it was difficult to get deci-
sions on the smaller matters, particularly
if Menzies was not very interested in
them. But Holt is at this stage at least
interested in everything. He wants de-
cisions made and made promptly. Minis-
ters find him always accessible. They can
get in to him to talk about their prob-
lems at any hour of the day and night,
and Holt is prepared to listen to them
and assist them irrespective of the size
of their problem.
Even in minor things this attitude is
showing up. The Menzies Government
fiddled round for months on the ques-
tion of issuing a special medal for
servicemen who had served in Vietnam.
Holt last week announced that a decision
had been taken to strike such a medal.
Detailed conditions of eligibility were
being worked out and would be an-
nounced.
This seems to be the Holt approach.
If a decision has to be made, make it.
While a thing might seem small to many
people, it is important to those involved

to let them know where they stand. On
drought, on which the Menzies Govern-
ment also fiddled, Holt acted promptly.
Instead of continuing the endless buck-
passing between the Commonwealth and
States, Holt announced $5O million for
farm loan funds to provide primary pro-
ducers with greater access to medium and
long-term capital for development pur-
poses.
Holt has also taken seriously his res-
ponsibility as head of the Government
to report to Parliament. His speech last
week covered so wide a range of subjects
from Vietnam through to his legis-
lative programme that it tired mem-
bers of Parliament. If it did that to them,
it probably did worse to the listening
public. It could undoubtedly have done
with some heavy sub-editing, but never-
theless it disclosed his approach to the
Parliament, which was to keep it inform-
ed to the best of his ability, and it un-
doubtedly won appreciation from that
section of the Parliament, both Govern-
ment and Opposition, which has felt
that Parliament, as an institution, has
been increasingly subordinated to the
executive.
Mr Holt’s major weakness vis-a-vis
Sir Robert Menzies is that he has not
yet developed the ruthlessness that seems
to be essential for the successful leader
of a government or a parliamentary
party. Holt spent quite a significant part
of his parliamentary time attempting to
justify his Government’s policy on north-
ern development the policy on which
it lost the Dawson by-election. Menzies
never fought hopeless political battles,
battles that could not be won, unless
there was some vital principle at stake.
There is no vital principle at stake here.
Government policy is that there should
be northern development. The question
is how.
Menzies would have recognised that
irrespective of how impressive the Gov-
ernment’s northern development policy
was on paper, it could not be sold. The
voters would not have it. Dawson proved
that. A realist, he would probably be
studying what section of the Opposi-
tion’s northern development programme
he could take over and make his own. In
this way, he would have a chance of
retrieving his losses. But Holt is still
vainly trying to tell the voters of
Northern Queensland that they do not
really understand that the Govern-
ment’s northern development programme
which they rejected is really a very good
one.
This weakness and desire to justify
himself rather than write off his losses
is probably a hangover from his term in

the Treasury. Holt was always at his best
in dealing with people and events. When
he moved into the Treasury and had to
deal with things rather than people or
events, he became a little desiccated.
This might only be a temporary phase
something from which he will recover
as he settles into the Prime Ministership.
But it is a dangerous thing, as it deprives
him of necessary ruthlessness not only
with events but things.
On the personal side, the Prime Minis-
tership has made surprisingly little dif-
ference in Holt. He is as approachable
and as unassuming as ever. He enjoys a
joke. It has not affected his generosity.
His congratulations to Patterson on win-
ning the Dawson seat were attractively
warm and modest. (He admitted that
his Government would have to study the
implications.)
Oddly, he has lost some of his fluency.
Because he is Prime Minister he feels
that he must select his words with much
greater precision than he did previously
and this is tending to make him more
verbose than he is natural. He will
probably get over this as time moves on.
But the Holt administration and its
techniques are significantly different
from those of the Menzies administra-
tion. Whether they are better or worse
and whether they will continue to be
different only the future can tell.

TAA is a business enterprise required
to make a profit and pay a dividend just

In its operation TAA enjoys no special privi-
leges over its competitors. TAA must win every
passenger and pound of air cargo in open business
competition.
BUSINESS EFFICIENCY
The fact that TAA gains the greater overall
share of the competitive passenger market is in-
dicative of TAA’s business efficiency.
The continued business success of TAA helps
to preserve the competition vital to a healthy
airline industry.
BENEFITS OF COMPETITION
This competition guarantees that every Austra-
lian will continue to enjoy the right to choose by
which airline he will’fly, or consign air cargo.
Competition also helps maintain the highest
standards of service for Australian air travellers.
Supporters of free enterprise, in placing busi-
ness with TAA, are preserving for themselves
these benefits of business competition in the air-
line industry.

AROUND CANBERRA
Not a Muscovy Duck Type
The opening of Holt's Parliament
By BATMAN
One of the old hands in Canberra
said: “Give the poor man a bit of
sympathy. It's like taking over
after the death of Louis XIV. The
throne’s devilishly uncomfortable.”
This was true. Even though he had
gone home, the presence of Sir Robert
seemed to hang round the place like
Hamlet’s Ghost. Even Mr Holt admitted
that it was downright difficult to stop
referring to Sir Robert as “Prime Min-
ister”. Nor was it easy at first to think
of Harold Holt as other than the Treas-
urer. Anyway the Speaker found it thus.
There was the occasion when a question
was directed to Mr McMahon and the
Speaker called: “The Right Honorable,
the Treas . . . er . . . the . . , ah . . .
the Honorable the Treasurer.”
And if his presence was like Hamlet’s
Ghost, indeed there were times when
they seemed to be trying to exorcise his
spirit. There were tributes in the House
to Sir Robert’s 31 years of service.
Harold Holt set out to destroy the
tough old image. Sir Robert was
not cold, dominating, aloof, but a
kindly, friendly man. There was
the occasion when he sat Aboriginal
children on his knees and sang
“The Song of the Galloping
Major”. A voice came from the
Opposition benches: “Don’t be so
nauseating.”
It may be necessary even yet
to burn some candles and hang a few
cloves of garlic around King’s Hall to
complete the exorcisation ceremony. Yet
already there is a different atmosphere,
newspapermen rarely saw Sir Robert at
close quarters. Always he entered the
House by a side door, and it would have
been unthinkable to bail him up in the
passage. Harold Holt is using Sir Rob-
ert’s black Bentley with the Cl number-
plate and that’s where the similarity ends.
He is an almost astonishingly cour-
teous man. Even when he is tried to
the point of exhaustion and newspaper
people stop him in King’s Hall at 1 a.m.
he will talk with great politeness. It is
sort of de rigueur to hang around the
front door of Parliament House in early
mornings. Harold Holt always came in
that way when he was Treasurer and
chatted for a few moments to every-
body. His personal public relations was
always terribly good, and it still is. He
is still coming in that way, still chatting
and the Prime Ministerial arrival has be-
come a regular event to be savored by
the tourists.
Press conferences with Sir Robert
were occasions to remember, like the
arrival of spectacular comets. Harold
Holt is having them all the time. Why,
some of the Gallery staff are finding it an
agony, all this getting up early in the
morning. He will have them at such
ugly hours as nine in the morning. In
off hours it is no trouble to get a per-
sonal interview. Sir Robert refused in-
terviews to Pressmen, both local and
overseas; he was fearlessly impartial.
Harold Holt, since he became PM, has
barely stopped giving interviews to the
international Press. It's been like the
breaking of the ramparts; world-wide
publicity for Australia—everything from
a two-page interview in the ‘'lllustrated
London News” to a spread in the “Chris-
tian Science Monitor”.
It is extraordinary how much an in-
stitution resembles its master. It
is still early. The real tensions of
office have yet to arrive. But the
PR image has gone right through
the establishment. One Gallery
man said: “It’s wonderful. Offi-
cials who wouldn't talk before,
who were terrified of even being
seen with me, now are even call-
ing me up.”
At his Press conference the
other morning, one noticed that he
was reading “Syme”, by C. E. Sayers,
one of John Hetherington’s books of
profiles of Australians, and “Search for
the Golden Fleece”. The room was de-
corated with motifs of the sea and there
were three large pearl shells on his desk
alone, apart from others on the book-
shelves. On the walls were a large group
picture of the Commonwealth Confer-
ence at Ottawa in 1952 and some rather
indifferent oils and water-colors. There
was just one thing gone from the Men-
zies era that we noted with a sense of
disappointment. There used to be a
glorious picture of Keith Miller, all grace
and style, knees bent, bat flat and out-
stretched in the process of the most ex-
quisite of late cuts. In its place, it must
be admitted, was a comely picture of
Zara.
In the House we looked forward with
enthusiasm to his state-of-the-nation
speech. Here we missed the great roll-
ing, Edwardian phrases of Sir Robert.
It was a definitive statement; it had to

be precise, but not that precise. He
approached it in exactly the manner of
his Budget—dogged, unyielding, head
down, every word read like the head-
master’s annual report. And even those,
usually, are taken as read these times.
Holt is best when he is being savagely
attacked, but Opposition minds were
completely elsewhere. Mr Whitlam was
present; one rather suspects, like a hus-
band at breakfast, he never heard a word
that was said.
Harold Holt is going carefully. He is
making no statements that he is a man
of destiny and he has no intention of sell-
ing his place in St George’s Road,
Toorak, or his house at Portsea. At his
Press conference he even stated flatly
that he had no intention of selling his
place at Bingil Bay, in North Queensland.
“I want to keep that for my retirement,
either soon or otherwise.”
That’s another piece of good Holt PR.
He is still giving the impression con-
stantly that he is a caretaker Prime Min-
ister. He won’t consider that he really
has the job until he is elected by the
Australian people.
At the moment he is living at the
Hotel Canberra, and he hasn’t moved
into the Prime Minister’s Lodge. The
Lodge will be in the hands of the
painters for several weeks yet. How-
ever, the painting is not being done on
behalf of Zara; it is for the visit of the
Queen Mother. You must appreciate
everything always gets painted for
Royalty.
No, Zara Holt is not in there at the
Lodge interior decorating “all systems
go”. After the next election we may see
dramatic changes. And it would be
most surprising if we did not see a swim-
ming pool in the place where the Mus-
covy ducks used to be. The Holts could
hardly be described as the Muscovy duck
type.
NEW YORK LETTER
The Irish Disapprove
St Patrick in America
From QEORGE McGANN
O, St Patrick was a gentleman
Who came of decent people,
He built a church in Dublin town
And on it put a steeple
Ireland’s patron saint did much more
than that, of course. For , one
thing, he drove out the snakes; for
another, he made the lowly shamrock a
symbol. For still another, and one won-
ders if the Holy man could ever have
dreamt of such a marvel, he was to in-
spire a foreign city 3000 miles across
Atlantic waters to an annual binge of
sentimentality on his birthday—a binge
based on the tenuous ties of a tiny minor-
ity of its population to the “Ould Sod”
and bolstered by the consumption of al-
coholic beverages to the extent that it is
rivalled in its after-effects only by the
hangovers of New Year’s Day itself.
New York’s shameless love affair with
Ireland is reaching full bloom this week,
as we approach the green morning of
March 17. The Irish echo has already
blossomed on news-stands with a sham-
rock garland surrounding the proud head-
line: “Nelson Bites the Dust—Blast
Topples Statue.” This bit of handiwork
by saboteurs in Dublin, in celebration of
the fiftieth anniversary of “The
Troubles”, has delighted and inspired the
supporters of the IRA in this town. Ac-
cording to Jimmy Breslin, a local jour-
nalist of Irish extraction and large ac-
quaintance in the Third Avenue pubs, the
disciples of Irish freedom hereabouts are
spending most of their time marking X’s
on maps to denote other targets for anti-
British dynamiters in Dublin, Belfast and
even in London itself. One suspects
that the New York cops, despite their
natural Hibernian sympathies, will be
keeping a special watch on the British
Consulate on Fifth Avenue on Thursday.
The Consulate happens to be right along
the line of march for the grand and
glorious St Patrick’s Day parade, which
as usual will comprise 125,000 marchers
and 210 bands and require six hours to
pass the reviewing stand in fair weather
or foul.
There are St Patrick’s Day celebra-
tions elsewhere in this land, to be sure.
At Niagara Falls they will be shining
green lights on to the tumbling waters
and into the great gorge that night. And
at Ashbury Park, New Jersey, they will
spread green dye in the ocean waters.
But no other city can boast a parade to
compare with New York’s, nor such a
variety of impromptu post-parade cele-
brations in bars, cafes and homes. What
other city would attract such guests as,
for example. Berlin’s Mayor Willy Brandt,
or Sydney’s erstwhile Lord Mayor, Harry

Powers the Black Knight space vehicle
100% success in 22 space firings
THE Bristol Siddeley Gamma is
without equal in Europe.
Twenty-two times Gamma rocket
engines have launched Black Knight
re-entiy research vehicles into
space without a single failure.
It is just one of a range of
Bristol Siddeley rocket engines which have
built up an outstanding reputation for re-
liability since the Company entered the field
nearly twenty years ago.
Many components from these engines can
be interchanged to produce rapidly, and at
low cost, new engines ranging from 50-lb to
100,000-lb thrust. These are suitable for a
wide variety of applications including all
stages of a satellite launching vehicle.
Concurrent with developments in rocket
engines, Bristol Siddeley’s Advanced Pro-
pulsion Research Group is making a signifi-
cant contribution to the design and develop-
ment of powerplants of
the future, including turbo-
ramjet engines.
These new forms of power will find ready
.applications to projects such as recoverable
first-stage satellite launchers, intercontinental
communications vehicles, and airliners capable
of cruising at 4,000 mph.

Jensen? Incidentally, the good Danish
Jensen delighted his New York hosts,
notably parade marshal Jim Farley, by
confiding in the reviewing stand: “I have
a right to be here—l had an Irish grand-
mother.”
Not all the guests have been as wel-
come as Sydney’s Lord Mayor. A group
of students at Fordham University invited
Brendan Behan to march with them
several years ago. Behan was kept out
of the parade, however, by the organis-
ing committee, who called him “a com-
mon drunk”. The playwright castigated
the committee in turn as “wanting to look
like Queen Victoria’s husband” and took
himself off to nearby Jersey City, where
he marched in that parade to the delight
and entertainment of all.
In what other city have deeds to
Ireland's sacred soil been dis-
tributed to lucky bar customers
on the Saint’s day? Last year a
New York brewing company
bought an acre of land in Con-
naught province, part of an
ancient estate called Netley
Park, cut it up into plots of
one square foot and mailed out
30,000 deeds to denizens of
P. J. Clarke’s pub and similar
East Side oases.
A compulsion to sing “The
Rising of the Moon” or “Galway
Bay” and to speak in a thick Irish brogue
seizes a large part of t-he local populace,
most of whom have never been any
closer to Ireland than the Fifth Avenue
office window of Irish International Air-
lines. (This week the heroic figure of St
Patrick, at least twice life-size and res-
plendent in flowing green robes and flow-
ing white beard, fills that window.) One
year, John McNulty, a writer for “The
New Yorker” who hailed from Boston,
lapsed into a brogue in Tim Costello’s
saloon after the parade. Someone re-
marked he had never realised that
McNulty was an Irishman. Guitarist
Eddie Condon, who was in the group, re-
plied: “He isn't—he bought the brogue
in the slot-machine in the corner.”
Although one supposes that most of
the 125,000 green-sashed, shillelagh-
waving marchers up Fifth Avenue boast
at least a modicum of Irish blood, some
strange names, and faces, turn up annu-
ally in the event. A newspaper reporter
polled one rank at random a few years
ago and got these names: Mennit, Cam-
pagna, Neill, Goldner, Gillespie, Corbo,
Coteta, Carney, Hall, Janelli. He also
spotted two marchers of distinct Oriental
appearance, as well as a Negro bagpiper.
At Moskowitz and Lupowitz restaurant,
a Second Avenue establishment noted
for its Kosher cuisine, a group called the
“Yiddish Sons of Erin” meet for dinner
every St Patrick’s night. There the 150
Irish-born Jews and their families are
entertained with a programme of Yid-
dish and Irish folksongs. A never-to-be-
forgotten St. Patrick’s night was the one
when they entertained visiting Lord
Mayor Robert Briscoe of
Dublin, a fellow-Jew.
At the United Nations, an
African delegate strode into the
General Assembly one fine St
Patrick’s Day wearing a white
tribal robe striped in bright
green. A bearded Sikh of the
Indian delegation literally top-
pled him by winding Kelly-
green around his blue turban.
Authentic Irishmen, accus-
tomed to the quietly religious
observance of St Patrick's Day
at home, are often taken aback by their
first glimpse of the gaudy spectacle New
York has made of the Saint's day. Irish
diplomats bridle at the clay pipes, green
hats and shillelaghs sported by merry-
makers. “This is a concept we would
love to change,” commented Brian
Durnin, First Secretary of the Irish
Embassy. “It tends to detract from
Ireland’s dignity and emergence in
world affairs. I was shocked when I
went to my first St Patrick’s party and
Congressmen came charging at me with
their green ties and trappings. This has
all been fostered by the stage Irish for
American audiences.”
\
But this is distinctly a minority view.
A New York politician would as soon
strike a baby in public as miss being seen
Thursday in the parade’s reviewing stand
beside Governor Rockefeller and Mayor
Lindsay. And Francis, Cardinal Spell-
man, now' approaching his eightieth year,
still prides himself upon standing on the
steps of St Patrick’s Cathedral for the
parade’s full six hours, regardless of the
weather, extending episcopal grace to the
marching thousands.
Sf Patrick’s Day has become a New
York institution —one which has less
and less each year to do with Ireland.

How much can an Australian see
on atrip to London?
This much and more-
with a Pan Am ticket:

and the wide,wonderful U.S.A.!

When an Australian flies to London, it makes sense for
him to see the U.S.A. and Europe, too. After all, you
don’t pop over to Great Britain just any old day.
And you can actually see all of the places mentioned for
less than the round trip fare to London via the U.S.A.
and return. How? It’s simple. Instead of coming
back to Australia the same way—via the U.S.A.—you
just continue on around the world with us.
It costs less that way.
You can see much more than the list of cities above.
We fly to places like Lisbon, Barcelona, Nice,
Copenhagen, Berlin. You name it—we’ll write your
ticket to any place you’d like to go in Europe. And the
fares are remarkably reasonable.
You’ll love the trip. On the way, we’ll stop in sunny
Hawaii. Then on to any one of four West Coast
Gateways—Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland or
Seattle. From the West Coast we can take you nonstop
to London. Of, if you like, we’ll write your ticket to
20 U.S.A. cities from coast to coast.
On your way home you can fly straight through to the
Orient from Europe—then home. Or you can stop
over in nine fascinating cities from Beirut to Hong
Kong—at no extra fare.
Think about it for a moment. Doesn’t it make sense
to turn a London business trip into a U.S.A.-Europe
holiday? Of course it does.
Call your Pan Am Travel Agent. Or give us a ring.
You’ll relish the service. You’ll rave about the cuisine—
by Maxim’s of Paris. And you’ll have that
incomparable feeling, flying with the very best.

THE INTELLIGENT WOMAN'S GUIDE
Some Other
Year’s Face
Nothing is quite so dating as to be
wearing some other year’s face.
If you favor deeply colored face-
powder and obvious rouge, you are
probably over 60. If you have no eye
make-up at all, you are either over
50 or have conjunctivitis, or both.
Wearing bright, red lipstick: over 40 or
broke for some time. Eye-liner on the
upper lid only: over 30 and/or with an
alcoholic tremor.
Personally, I view what I have seen
of this year’s face all particle-loaded
mascara, omnidirectional eye-liner, pale
powder and pale opalescent lipstick
with foreboding. Because I agree with
de Beauvoir and Kingsley Amis that
fashion in clothes, make-up, appearance,
indicates status in society as much as an
attempt to attract or compete.
Wealthy Egyptian ladies painted their
eyebrows, added a thick, dark line under
each eye with kohl and had different eye-
paints for different seasons of the year.
They rouged their cheeks and lips and
hennaed their finger and toenails. They
also enjoyed a position unique in the
ancient world. The goddess mothers,
Nut, Isis, Osiris, retained their prestige
after marriage; the couple was the
religious and social unit; women had the
same rights as men.
Roman women used kohl, white lead
or chalk for whitening the skin, and
rouge for the cheeks only. This took
many hours and the services of assorted
slaves, organised by an ornatrix and
punished for inaccuracies by slaps,
pinches and sticking with pins. It didn’t
matter much how long it took, because
Roman matrons (like the Greek) had
little else to do. They were excluded
from public affairs and remained
legally minors all their lives, subject to
the guardianship of their fathers,
brothers, husbands and later of the state.
The Dark Ages were dark about cos-
metics, too, but the Crusaders reintro-
duced Arabian perfumes. And women
continued their dependent subservience.
They could be married off by their over-
lords and repudiated by their husbands,
with no say at all themselves. Knights
were more attached to their horses than
to women (they were worth more).
By the beginning of the Renaissance,
cosmetics were in general use in Italy,
France and, rather later, in England. By
the time of Elizabeth I we see a beauty
specialist, Dr Plaster-face, on the stage
in Marston’s “The Malcontent” “Do
you know Dr Plaster-face? By this curd
he is most exquisite in forging of veins,
sprighting of eyes, dyeing of hair, sleek-
ing of skins, blushing of cheeks and
bleaching of teeth, that ever made an old
lady gracious by moonlight”. And while
woman’s legal status remained almost
unchanged from the beginning of the
fifteenth century to the nineteenth, her
actual situation did improve. Women
became rulers, artists, writers and
musicians, though their limited educa-
tion made great achievements few, and
women still usually gained power in
Madame de Maintenon’s way as an
influence rather than as an agent.
Elaborate make-up and women’s free-
dom continued hand in hand through
the eighteenth century. The fashion for
patches began as an attempt to hide dis-
figurements by means of a small, black
wafer of what is still sometimes called
“court plaster”. Pepys had described the
Duchess of Newcastle “Wearing many
black patches because of pimples about
her mouth”. The patches developed from
simple wafers to suns, stars, crescents,
and even a silhouette of a coach and
horses cut out and stuck to the forehead.
Very useful to smallpox victims, qo
doubt.
With the French
Revolution, the ad-
miration for Nature
restored the unvar-
nished complexion;
the fear of anarchy
restored the subser-
vience of women.
The Romantic ideal
woman, always
about to go off “into
a decline”, was pale-
faced and dim,
rather than coarse-
ly colored. She was
also confined to the
nursery and home,
closely watched, kept
wholly dependent,
honored and treated
with exquisite pol-
iteness. “The married
woman is a slave
whom one must be
able to set on a
throne,” Balzac cun-
ningly observed.
Only in the twentieth century have
respectable women again been able to
make up their faces as they please.
What bothers me at the moment is
this. Kingsley Amis once wrote an
article in which he drew attention to such
interesting sidelights on beauty as the
fashionableness of prominent stomachs
at times when only the rich have enough
to eat; the value of a tan in northern
Europe where it is associated with travel,
money, status; the preference for a white
skin in the south, where it suggests se-
clusion rather than work in the fields;
the romantic value of a discreet dark
moustache (female), suggesting the
eastern Mediterranean and firing the
poetic imagination in Byron’s day; and
the size and power of Lady Hamilton’s
arms (able to send Goethe as well as
Nelson into raptures) which should
have been an asset because large ladies
were considered seductive, but which
weren’t because they kept reminding
cartoonists of her blacksmith father. He
also put forward the fascinating theory
that the modern emphasis on the mouth
(size and color) as opposed to the earlier
emphasis on the eyes is the result, not of
women suddenly learning to talk, but of
men suddenly beginning to listen, begin-
ning to turn away from baby dolls to
women as people. Right back to the
Middle Ages and right up to Mary Pick-
ford you have the same face large
eyes, small mouth and often low fore-
head thrown in.
So you can see why I’m worried
about all those pale, beige lips.
CLARISSA BLACK
"Mr Pinthrop, our inquiries reveal that your social
contacts are impeccable, your home life beyond re-
proach and your wife a perfect mate for a top-level
executive. Unfortunately, they also reveal that you are
a slob."


OVERSEAS
The Kremlin
Even Russians in Moscow branded
the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky
(“Abram Tertz”) and Yuli Daniel
(“Nikolai Arzhak”) a “sham”, and
the barbarous sentences passed on them
have created a world-wide uproar among
left-wing intellectual circles.
Arbitrary terror was the hallmark of
the 1930’5, when hundreds of people dis-
appeared into Lubianka Prison or the
wastes of Siberia without a semblance of
judicial procedure. But in the 1940’5,
with the exception of the execution of
the most important representatives of
Yiddish letters (1949-1950), not even
under Stalin were nonconformist writers
necessarily treated with the brutality and
cynicism that befell Sinyavsky and
Daniel.
Of course, it would be absurd to claim
that the general political atmosphere in
Russia today is the same as or worse
than it was twenty years ago. Soviet
society is incomparably more free and
the regime more lenient than under Stalin
and Zhdanov. To cite but one example,
in the campaign unleashed by Zhdanov
in 1946 nearly every Soviet writer was
forced to heap abuse upon the hapless
victims, whereas now, significantly
enough, not a single Soviet intellectual
of stature has yet identified himself with
the campaign unleashed by Zhdanov’s
heirs. The question at issue is whether
in the context of the political develop-
ments in the Soviet Union over the past
decade or so, the trial of Sinyavsky and
Daniel was indeed “something of a vic-
tory in the struggle for broader civil
liberties” or whether it was a setback
for the progressive forces in Russia and
a victory for those who wish to contain
the struggle for broader civil liberties.
Shortly after Khrushchev’s not so
secret anti-Stalin speech of February,
1956, a drastic reform of Soviet (that
is, Stalinist) law was initiated, resulting
in the promulgation, two years later, of
the “Fundamental Principles of Criminal
Legislation” fourteen laws that were
to serve as the basis for codes to be
adopted by each of the republics of the
Soviet Union. Other laws, dealing with
crimes against the state, military crimes,
and military courts, were passed shortly
thereafter, and in 1960 the Criminal
Code of the Russian Republic the
largest republic of all was enacted.
It is under the provision of Article 70
of this code, which stipulates punishment
for “anti-Soviet” propaganda and agita-
tion”, that Daniel and Sinyavsky were
brought to trial six years later.
Perhaps the single most important
achievement of the legal reforms of
1957-1960 was the strengthening of due
process of law in the Soviet Union. The
worst injustices of the Stalin era such
as the special boards of t£e Ministry of
Internal Affairs, which had the power
to sentence people to hard labor without
any hearings, without right to
and with no right of appeal had al-
ready been eliminated in the immediate
post-Stalin period. But the Principles did
away with the noxious “analogy clause”,
which had permitted prosecution and
punishment for crimes not expressly
covered in the statute books. According
to Article 3 of the Principles, “Only per-
sons guilty of committing a crime, that
is, those who intentionally or by negli-
gence have committed a socially dan-
gerous act specified by the criminal
statute, shall be held responsible and in-
cur punishment.”
The role of the defence lawyer, who
was previously little more than a pawn
in the hands of the procurator, was
greatly enhanced, and the presumption
of the innocence of the defendant until
proved guilty was established. The doc-
trine that especially in
“counter - revolutionary”
crimes the burden of
proof shifts to the ac-
cused was repudiated.
These and other reforms
had created a climate that
made it exceedingly diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for
the Soviet authorities to re-
turn to the most egregious
malpractices of the Stalin
era. Even Valeriy Tarsis,
given to describing the So-
viet leaders as “fascists”
and “bandits”, has made it
clear that he regards the present era as
a vast improvement over the Stalin days.
Unless, then, the Soviet authorities
were willing to repudiate and thus make
a complete mockery of all their assur-
ances that there would be no return to
the crimes, they had to provide some sort
of a trial for the two writers, and they
had to cloak it with at least the minimum
trappings of orderly procedure. Further-
more, the post-Stalin climate had made
it possible for Sinyavsky and Daniel to
resist pressures to confess and for them
to behave in court with courage and
dignity. Yet once the unavoidable con-
cessions to the spirit of the time were
made, the Soviets demonstrated again
that, in the words of an eminent author-
ity on Soviet law, “There still is nothing
to prevent them from flagrantly flouting
their own laws.”
The basic requirement of a “genuine”
trial is that both the prosecution and the
defence be given an opportunity to pre-
sent their cases in court, and that the
verdict be based on an objective evalua-
tion of the evidence presented, without
any prior assumption of the guilt of the
accused. This seemingly elementary prin-
ciple was implicitly accepted in the new
legislation, but because of the weight of
tradition and the power of the procura-
tor who controls the preliminary inves-
tigation, it has been frequently and open-
ly disregarded by Soviet courts so
much so that some of the most notable
judicial authorities in the Soviet Union
have found it necessary to denounce the
abuses and to plead for firm observance
of the rule of law.
There is every indication that the
“guilt” of the two writers was established
from the day of their arrest in Septem-
ber, 1965, that the preliminary investiga-
tion was merely to confirm their guilt,
and that the purpose of the trial itself
was simply to invest it with a cloak of
legality. Prior to the trial, the defendants
were subjected to a public campaign of
slander and calumny for
which there is no parallel
in the post-Stalin era.
The trial was supposedly
open, but in fact it was held
before a carefully screened
audience, from which even
the non-Soviet Communist
Press was excluded. The
reports that appeared in
Soviet newspapers were un-
believably tendentious, so
that it is impossible to get
a clear picture of the ac-
tual proceedings. And as
for the role of the defence
counsel, it was so negligible as to make
it virtually non-existent.
Let us first glance at the campaign
that was waged before the trial. The first
salvo was fired by Radio Moscow on
January 3. It was in English, and it was
written by one Boris Belitsky. Though
he had “no intention of anticipating
what judgment would be pronounced,”
he was nevertheless “certain that the
two men will have to answer for pub-
lishing vile fabrications and conducting
propaganda against their own country”.
He added the blithe assurance that
“neither is regarded as a writer in this
country and neither has much of a liter-
ary reputation”. After delivering this
barefaced lie, Belitsky went on to state
that “As for the lampoons they have
been producing for export” (which un-
like most of his countrymen he was ap-
parently permitted to read), “very emin-
ent and erudite critics and philologists
are agreed that these are libelous, malic-
ious, and very often almost illiterate.”
The radio broadcast was followed ten

days later by an article in “Izvestia”,
“Turncoats”. Its author, Dmitri Yeremin,
had distinguished himself previously by
attacking Dudintsev’s “Not By Bread
Alone” and Solzhenitsyn’s “One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich”, and his
style ran true to form (“moral perverts”,
“renegades”, “rabid and unbridled ene-
mies of Communism”, “from petty nasti-
ness to grand treason”, and so on).
Five days later, “Izvestia” published
five of the “numerous responses” to
Yeremin’s article. One was from Sulei-
man Rustam, People’s (i.e., Court) Poet
of Azerbaijan, recipient of a Stalin Prize,
the Order of Lenin and several other
awards (the first of his “Selected Poems”,
published in 1948, was dedicated to
Stalin, and opens with the words “How-
ever many lines about you I were to
compose, my voice shall not die in my
throat”). In his letter, Rustam recom-
mended the “uprooting of weeds that
have sprouted in the midst of our gar-
den”. He was followed by three “creative
artists” from the city of Voronezh, and
then by a woman agronomist from Lat-
via, Z. Gulbis, whose contribution reach-
ed the heights of traditional Soviet bathos.
“What could be dearer than the
Motherland? It is as necessary to man
as the sun, as the air, as a clear spring
which, no sooner than you’ve touched it
with your lips, fills your chest with life-
giving strength.”
Mrs Gulbis was especially exercised
about a passage from one of Daniel’s
works about women, cited by Yeremin:
“With what cynicism does Daniel
Arzhak write about our women! After
all, he owes his life to a woman, his
mother. To betray one's mother, to be-
tray one’s motherland it’s all one and
the same thing.”
The final word belonged to the liter-
ary Establishment, in the person of the
write Zoya Kedrina, whose article ap-
peared in the January 22 issue of the
“Literary Gazette”. It would be tedious to
cite all the invective with which this
ostensible essay in literary criticism
abounds including the incredible
charge that Sinyavsky’s borrowing of
literary techniques and devices from
other authors constituted “theft”. But
one accusation deserves special mention
namely, that Sinyavsky’s writings
emit “a steady aroma of anti-Semitism”.
In prior attacks on Sinyavsky, he was
sometimes accused of trying, through
the use of his pseudonym, Abram Tertz
to “create the impression that anti-Semit-
ism exists in our country”. It was left to
the author of “Smerdyakov’s Heirs” (the
title of the Kedrina article), however, to
turn this allegation on its head by main-
taining that Sinyavsky himself was an
anti-Semite! How? By ascribing the views
of certain characters in Tertz’s stories
(all of them obvious caricatures) to their
author!
The reports on the proceedings (the
trial opened in Moscow on February 10
and lasted three days) were all in the
same vein. “Laughter in court met Sin-
yavsky’s hypocritical assertions of his
love for the Russian people” (“Tass”).
“The court patiently listened to the de-
fendant’s long replies to the simple con-
crete questions” (ibid). “Those present
were at times indignant at the extreme
cynicism of the accused and at other
times openly laughed at their, to put it
mildly, naive replies” (“Izvestia”). But
the choicest morsels came from Radio
Moscow:
“Daniel, tall, thin, with black insolent
eyes . . . behaves in a casual manner at
the beginning of the interrogation, im-
pudently denying the obvious. But then,
when the prosecution presents to the
court a number of proofs, fright and con-
fusion appear ever more often on the
slanderer’s face. Yes, his back is to the
wall, and he begins to feel that in spite
of all subterfuges he will not succeed in
evading responsibility. From time to
time he glances with a confused expres-
sion at the courtroom —at the public—
as if seeking support. Under the weight
of evidence, he is forced to admit all
the facts of his criminal activity. Hatred
towards our system, toward our people,
sounds in his answer. It is in vain that
he tries to mask it.”
The trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and
Yuli Daniel, surely two of the most
gifted writers to appear in Russia in the
past quarter of a century, leaves many
questions still unanswered—the chief of
them, perhaps, why the Soviet authori-
ties have decided to make fools of them-
selves by reverting to discredited Stalin-
ist methods, and why they have decided
to flout public opinion, including that of
their own friends abroad. The answer
to this question cannot be easily dis-
posed of in a few lines. Yet one thing
can no longer be questioned: the trial
constitutes a blatant repudiation of the
gains made by Soviet law in recent
years. In many respects it marks a re-
turn to the foulest and most detestable
practices of a period that is remembered
with a shudder.
But this very reversal may yet turn
out to be another nail in the coffin of
the Soviet system. The trial revealed
that Sinyavsky and Daniel were not
alone, that they had friends who were
ready to come to their support. The
Press was at a loss: On the one hand,
By ABRAHAM BRUMBERG
it tried to portray the two writers as
isolated individuals, ostracised by their
fellow citizens and especially fellow
writers, yet on the other it had to reckon
with the numerous witnesses who testi-
fied at the trial that they had been ac-
quainted with the works of “Tertz” and
“Arzhak” and who were obviously sym-
pathetic to them.
Furthermore, some of their friends
were obviously engaged in the same
form of “criminal” activity: writing
books and stories for publication in
countries that are not ruled by guardians
of “socialist realism.” These writers may
now have been silenced, but their voices
will be heard again.

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT- significant growth from an idea
How many people know as they use thousands of tons of
Australian-made paper in stationery, books, magazines
and printed brochures that behind this highly organised
regular supply lies an unusual story of progress.
Thirty years ago, all our fine paper was imported because
pulp for this paper came from long-fibred wood, of which
Australia had little. Despite those who said it could not
be done, pulp for fine paper was made here from our own
short-fibred eucalypt trees and a great new industry,
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited, was born.
From idea to idea, process to process, quality to quality,
right through to catering for most of Australia’s needs
in fine paper, the company’s large mill at Burnie, Tasmania,
has never stopped developing its resources and its
products. This saves us millions of pounds in overseas
exchange every year.
And the long and short of Australia's growth, too, is the '
ability to stand on our own feet and develop our own ideas.

FORUM
Why Not Abolish State Schools?
By T. R. GARNETT
(Headmaster, Geelong Grammar School)
Two factors which tend to debase
Australian education are, first, that
not enough people value it enough
to think it worth spending money on;
and, secondly, that so much discussion is
carried on on the basis of ill-defined
terms many of them cliches and
slogans.
The result of the first is
spiral. The concept of education is nar-
rowed so that it is equated with formal
compulsory schooling. Where the teacher
is a more or less efficient, but at least
easily portable, audio-visual aid and
scarcely a human being at all, he (or
she) is little respected. Those who think
themselves under-valued are apt to
become assertive, more concerned with
status than with looking at their own
restrictive practices. So the natural re-
action of the public against the authority
vested in the teacher any teacher
is reinforced by what is interpreted as
money-grubbing. Respect is lessened, not
only for teachers but for education it-
self. What is not respected is not thought
worth spending money on. And so the
screw takes another twist.
Of course I know that I am general-
ising and exaggerating. There are thou-
sands of teachers who are respected, self-
sacrificing, efficient and even loved.
Nevertheless there is enough truth in
my thesis to be frightening. It is when
money is spent (or, rather, is seen to be
spent) that factor number two begins
to operate. “State Aid”, “Public School”,
“Independent School”, “Church School”
the phrases stir emotions, smother
thought.
Followers of the Cargo Cult are said
to believe that European artefacts are
stored ready-made in heaven, which lies
above Sydney and can be reached by
ladder. Some people seem to think that
the money to meet the bill for education
(the estimated amount in 1963-64 was
£185,558,540) lies in similar heavens
above the State capitals. It comes, of
course, from the pockets of the parents
of the children and from those who
have no children. People may suppose
that it comes from direct taxation of
“them”, i.e. those who are believed to
be richer than the speaker. Statisticians,
I suspect, would be disillusioning about
this.
What would happen if all the money
which sustains the edifices of educational
administration were left in parents’
pockets to spend on the education of their
-choice? Might we not get a better edu-
cated nation, where bad schools died
from lack of support and good schools
thrived because the parents had chosen
them for their excellence? After many
years of compulsory education and
at a time when it is increasingly clear to
a materialistic world that education
mea ns money (as well as other things
which idealists may worry about), have
we reached the point where parents are
considered sensible enough to elect the
politicians who will prescribe the edu-
cation of their children but not sensible
enough to choose the prescription for
themselves?

pelling children to attend them? A totali-
tarian society has no difficulty in answer-
ing that question, but Australia is not
totalitarian. The State systems, however,
are close to a totalitarian model and the
more efficient and the more all-embracing
they become, the more dangerous. A
cynic might say that the greatest safe-
guard is inefficiency in the system.
Utilitarians used to claim that com-
pulsory education for all would reduce
the crime rate, but they would find it diffi-
cult to substantiate the claim. “Every
child has a right to an education” the
windy clause avoids the difficult question
“What sort of education?” Every child
has a right to food but the State does not
(yet) provide “free” canteens and compel
children to attend them. What it does do
is to provide officers to help that very
small number of children who are neg-
lected by their parents. Why cannot it
do the same thing about education?
Meanwhile this exceedingly important
argument is constantly clouded by pre-
judice (factor number two). The mere
mention of certain types of school, or
particular schools, provides reactions as
irrational as that of elephants to white
mice. When the fourteen-year-old-son of
one of the Nigerian premiers was mur-
dered, the Press, ludicrously, reported
that he was a pupil at “£750-a-year ex-
clusive Eton College”. What on earth had
the epithets to do with the poor lad’s
death?
As the headmaster of a boarding school
with a necessarily more generous staff-
pupil ratio than a day school, I know that
the inclusive boarding fee will be jux-
taposed to day-boy fees at another school,
as if day-boys fed on air: that the
epithets “privileged”, “exclusive”, even
“snobbish” will dot the paragraphs like
sultanas. Of course there are rich parents
who send their sons to such a school,
some possibly for the wrong reasons:
but there are plenty of parents who are
not rich who deny themselves (and some
are helped by others) to send their sons
for honorable reasons. And are there
no rich parents who send their sons to
so-called “free” schools because they care
more for motor cars, holiday houses and
speed boats than they do for the edu-
cation of their children?
Good education is far more than for-
mal schooling and good education must
be expensive. Much of it may take place
at home: but books, visits to the theatre,
concerts, travel are not cheap.
Boarding school or day school? Neither
is excellent by virtue of the category it
is in. In all forms of education those who
most easily attract attention are the very
good and the very bad. To find the
courses of study, the interests, which
will get the best out of the ordinary
children who are neither very good nor
very bad, but who are yet in the majority
—that is the hardest and most important
thing to do. A boarding school has the
advantage that there is more time avail-
able to carry out this sifting and more
people to help wield the sieve.
I have digressed to boarding schools
because the constant emphasis on their
expensiveness helps to divert attention
from the parsimony extended to other
forms of education.
I have never been able to understand
why Governments cannot do one of two
things about education either keep out
of it altogether and leave it to parents
as citizens to provide what is needed
from incomes that are thereby less heavily
taxed; or decide how much money from
taxes can be allocated to schooling at
various levels and issue vouchers for
each child to be spent at the schools of
the parents’ choice.
It is not surprising that something
which is handed out on a plate, and a
cheap plate at that, should not be as
highly regarded as it ought to be.


LETTERS
Fairbairn's England
SIR. Your correspondent Geoffrey
Fairbairn is becoming as crashing a bore
as anything East of Suez. I was particu-
larly soothed by the article “England,
Whose England” (B_, Feb. 26) in which
he takes to task a group of Australian
painters, writers and academics in Lon-
don, who sponsored a demonstration con-
demming Australia’s involvement in
South Vietnam.
I am sure that Australia in general
will share his sense of affront at the idea
of any of our citizens, not being local
journalists and not having overnighted in
Saigon, presuming to take a moral stand
on a political issue. Perhaps he would like
to see these unqualified voters struck off
the electoral rolls? That would be in
keeping with the complacency with which
he regards the non-existence of democracy
in South Vietnam. No doubt England
is changing. Even the Clubmen are
changing. But the offensive weapons of
the club bore (“When I was in Sidi Bar-
rani”, “As old So-and-so used to tell me”,
etc.) remain drearily, drearily predict-
able. Incidentally, the cocktail-party
quip which so convulsed Mr Fairbairn
(“Great Britain should withdraw from
the Commonwealth”) was already stale in
London five years ago. I know. I was
there.

Lagging Libraries
SIR. —Your paragraph “Move to the
Suburbs” (8., Mar. 5) records the fact
of a decline in the number of people us-
ing the Public Library of New South
Wales and rightly attributes this to two
reasons. These are the improving ser-
vices in shire and municipal public lib-
raries and, particularly, in the libraries
of the two metropolitan universities. No
doubt, lack of parking space in this part
of the city is also a contributory cause.
There is, however, another and much
more important factor in this.
The Public Library of New South
Wales, especially through its General
Reference Department and its Mitchell
and Dixon Libraries and Galleries, is
and has always been designed as a lib-
rary for research workers and advanced
students. Use by readers of this kind
is in fact increasing, both because of the
rapidly growing needs of technology and
scholarly research and because the de-
cline in the number of undergraduate
and general readers is now making it
possible for the Library to give even bet-
ter service than before at the more ad-
vanced level. The figures for the Mitchell
Library help to illustrate this: between
1961-2 and 1964-5, the daily number of
users of that collection increased by 12
per cent. In the same period the number
of special queries dealt with in the Gen-
eral Reference Department rose by
nearly 33 per cent to 2,375. This does
not take into account the detailed work
of the Research Service which deals
mainly with technological questions for
industry and does not allow for a very
considerable amount of work done by
readers themselves with the very large
resources readily available to them. There
are nearly 50,000 volumes in open access
in the main reading room alone.
Overseas experience seems to show be-
yond doubt that an advanced technologi-
cal civilisation needs tremendous re-
sources in books for information pur-
poses. In spite of very generous support
by the Government the Public Library of
New South Wales is still far from being
the research library that New South
Wales needs.

Investigating the Police
SlR.—The Government’s recognition of
the need to estabish an authority inde-
pendent of the police to inquire into
complaints against police seems to have
shocked Mr Gordon Hawkins (8.,
Jan. 8).
This is not a problem to approach with
romantic ideals of honor. Whatever the
true facts inquired into may be, a find-
ing by the Commissioner after a secret
inquiry that no cause for suspicion
exists is satisfying to very few members
of the public. Proof that this is so is to
be found in the public demand for an
independent tribunal, a demand to
which the Premier has yielded by pro-
posing some form of independent
authority.
Does Mr Hawkins argue that the
Premier reacted to a mere “police
scandal syndrome”? All too frequently
allegations are made that a detained per-
son has been beaten by the police and
almost as frequently it is announced that
the Commissioner, having investigated
the matter, has found no cause for sus-
picion against the police. It would seem
from the sworn evidence in Brindle’s
case (the Aborigine who recently gained
a verdict against two police officers who
prosecuted h : m maliciously) and Stin-
vics’ case, that what occurs by way of
“investigation” is as follows:
A witness is asked to write his report
of what he says occurred. This report
is then given to a second witness
whose duty it is to add thereto his
version. The report travels in this
fashion from witness to witness until
it is said to be completed. None of
the witnesses are cross-examined, none
is taken aside and asked to make a
report without knowing what each of
the others has said and none of the
ordinary techniques used in a court
are followed.
Not surprisingly, the incredible consis-
tency of the report’s various versions
enables the Commissioner to announce
that no ground has been shown for
action against the police concerned.
Oddly enough, the public is not reas-
sured. Mr Hawkins, however, is not
completely satisfied himself. He reluc-
tantly admits that the present procedure
has not always resulted in fully satis-
factory handling of complaints by
police against police.
Notwithstanding this, however, Mr
Hawkins defends the present procedure
on the basis that there is nothing wrong
in principle with police inquiries into
complaints made against them by the
public. Lawyers, he argues, investigate
lawyers, doctors investigate doctors,
airmen, soldiers and sailors investigate
airmen, soldiers and sailors.
Does Mr Hawkins really see no dif-
ference between the case of a person
allegedly beaten in custody of, it may be,
a number of policemen and the case of
the solicitor who steals his client’s
moneys from his trust account? They
have in common that both are crimes
but the important distinction arises from
the practical differences in that in one
case there is an interest and opportunity
to fabricate an “innocent” explanation
of the assault in a situation where there
is frequently no other source of informa-

have each the common interest to fab-
ricate a false version and generally a
considerable body of documentary evi-
dence in the form of trust accounts,
bank statements, receipts, etc., makes
successful fabrication impossible. In
addition the investigation of the solici-
tor is done before the Statutory Com-
mittee and is accompanied by the usual
procedures of the Civil Court and is
public. In the case of doctors the same
situation by and large exists and the
disciplinary tribunal he comes before
follows legal procedures.
Mr Hawkins argues too that to re-
lieve the Commissioner of his jurisdic-
tions to inquire into complaints against
police would derogate from his pres-
tige as Commissioner. The number of
complaints made against police are for-
tunately not numerous in the overall
number of crimes which are handled
by the police. Their importance, how-
ever, is not proportionate to their num-
ber. Whatever derogation from the Com-
missioner’s authority, if any, be involved
in investing an independent authority
with power to investigate complaints is
more than compensated for in the public
confidence gained in the police force.
More cogently perhaps, Mr Hawkins
argues that the protection of the police
by the Commissioner is necessary against
the irresponsible, the frivolous, the ill-
disposed, and the malicious who have
nothing to lose in making groundless
charges. The need for such protection
does certainly exist. This would be
sufficiently quaranteed by the imposition
of costs against this class of irresponsible
complaint in cases where the complaint
has been found to be groundless. In these
cases as well it is equally important that
it should be demonstrated that no jus-
tification exists for the charge against
the police.
Lastly, Mr Hawkins’ objection to the
indelicacy of impugning the honesty and
integrity of the force really puts the
cart before the horse. The reflection on
the integrity of the force comes pri-
marily from the occasional misconduct
of certain police officers combined with
the practice of making secret investiga-
tions into that misconduct within the
force. The demand for an independent
inquiry is the result not the cause of
public disquiet.

Catholic Worker
SIR.—-In reply to the Chairman of the
“Catholic Worker”, Mr J. P. Ryan, (8.,
March 12) may I make the following
points:
1. I did not imply (as he alleges) that the
“Critic” group are commensurate with
Mr Ryan’s “Catholic Worker” group as
representatives of Catholic liberalism. I
specifically referred to “Critic” as a
“broadsheet” produced by a group “in
their twenties”; and wrote that “the
‘Catholic Worker’ was usually taken to be
the chief organ of Catholic Liberalism in
this country”. How can Mr Ryan make
such a gross misreading?
2. I nowhere said or implied (as he
again alleges) that the “Catholic Worker”
group has not read Orwell. What I did
imply was that a significant group of
young Catholic Liberals have been in-
fluenced by Orwell. Mr Ryan, if I write
that your opponent sucks eggs that does
not imply that you do not.
3. Mr Ryan accuses me of making “hack-
neyed charges”, “diagnostic fantasies”,
and of “invention of tendencies in the
‘Catholic Worker’ I notice in the cor-
respondence columns of the “C.W.”
(Feb., ’66) that two frequent contri-
butors and, I understand, members of
the editorial board of the “C.W.” share
a little of these fantasies and inventions.
One dissociates himself from your edit-
orial on the death of Dr Evatt and asks,
“Why all this venom? Do you still rankle
about the movement? It is the only thing
one can think”. The other, seeing only
too well the tendencies involved, wished
“to dissent most strongly from your Dec.
1965—Jan. 1966 editorial on Red China”.
4. May I make one last effort to con-
vince Mr Ryan and his colleagues that
it is not ill-will but political judgments
which are at the heart of this con-
troversy? In the February issue of the
“Catholic Worker”, there is a sympa-
thetic review of Dr Cairns’ “Living with
Asia” by a prominent member of the
“C.W.” editorial board. I did not invent
this quotation from it: “The book has
clearly been inspired by the war in Viet-
nam and Australia’s decision to send
troops there. It is on this issue that Dr
Cairns is most cogent and passionate”.
In the March issue an editorial un-
ashamedly states that the appointment
of Dr Cairns to the ALP Foreign Affairs
Committee was “an obvious and
thoroughly justifiable choice”.
5. The trouble with the “Catholic
Worker’s” kind of anti-Communism
(obvious as that is in many ways) is that
it makes too many concessions to the
climate of thought one often finds in
important sections of the ALP, in uni-
versity common-rooms, and other parade
grounds of Left-liberalism. This accounts
for the, at best, ambiguous positions
adopted by “C.W.” writers on Vietnam,
Red China, Indian neutralism, peace
congresses, Cairns, etc.

About Nothing Except Love
Visiting Barbara Hepworth in Cornwall
From ROBERT HUGHES in London
At Land’s End, England suddenly
stops. The earth of Cornwall
plunges away, in seamed granite
cliffs, to the Atlantic. In winter it
is a menacing sea, dully grey, streaked
with white and turquoise, grunting and
sucking at the black rocks which project
from it.
The light is very pure. It bounces
from all angles off the sea and is reflected
by the sky: it seems to be washed clean
by the great Atlantic winds, and one
can see for miles. Seen in the fading light,
a pair of mines on the ridge of a distant
hill have the mythical look of ancient
beasts poised for battle.
But then, this is an ancient landscape.
On the moors, one walks in the presence
of archetypes. The landscape is so bare,
so structural, so moulded and carved and
rippled by wind and water, that all its
elements are explicit: fined down to their
essential rhythms. The rocks above
Zen nor and St Ives are exposed like the
granite spine of a buried animal, and
the wind has cut them into sculptural
shapes: some of them, eroded to one
point of balance, can have their 10 or
50 tons set rocking by the pressure of
a hand.
“It's like a Hepworth,” I said to a
painter who lives in St Ives, Patrick
Heron, who represented England at the
Sao Paolo Biennale. We were looking
at such a rock, carved by friction into
a long moonlike curve and pierced with
holes. “It’s better,” said Heron. “It’s
original.” I did not agree. I had just
spent a couple of days with Barbara
Hepworth in her studio in St Ives.
Hepworth’s studio is tucked behind
a long, very high stone wall. The stones
she carves, the limestone, Hopton Wood
stone, black slate and translucent blocks
of marble, get hoisted over this wall
by a crane: visitors go in through a low,
blue, wooden door. The first impression,
on entering, is of cool, absolute precision,
black and white: a circular white dining-
table with black leather swivel chairs,
white walls, a collage by an Italian artist
named Valenti (three heavy overlapping
black shapes on a white ground): and
two corpulent cats, one black with white
spots, the other white with a black tail,
each with a bell round its neck to warn
the birds.
“We had a silent spring here last year,”
Barbara Hepworth told m». later. “A
frightening experience: one hardly heard
a single bird, not even an owl hooting
at night. Have you read Rachel Carson’s
book?” I had. “I’m doing what I can
to induce the birds to come back to my
garden, so the cats must be belled.” Like
everything else in the studio, the cats
have an infallible sense of placement,
gliding between the slate groups and
strung bronze forms like sailors in
rigging.
In “Private View”, Bryan Robertson
described Barbara Hepworth as “an
amiable Captain Ahab”. It was not my
first impression: but one was prepared
for something like it. The image suggests
a wrinkled, exultant giant of the sea,
driving the harpoon into the white whale
(or the chisel into the white Carrara)
with a rhetorical yell. In fact, the initial
surprise of meeting Barbara Hepworth—
banal as it sounds—is how small she is,
and how self-contained. Not a gesture
or a movement, not a flick of an eye-
brow, is wasted. How could this diminu-
ROBERT HUGHES
tive woman, 62 years old, with skin and
flesh laid over bones as delicate as a
seagull’s, have modelled and carved a
body of work five times the size of
Michelangelo’s, in equally resistant
materials and on as big a scale?
“I am constantly plagued by this little-
woman attitude,” she remarked to me.
“There is a deep prejudice against women
in art. Many people— most people still,
I imagine—think that women should not
involve themselves in the act of creation
except on its more trivial fringes. They
still think of sculpture as a male occupa-
tion: because, I suppose, they have a
misconception of what sculpture in-
volves. There is this cliche, you see, a
sculptor is a muscular brute bashing at
an inert lump of stone, but sculpture is
not rape. No good form is hacked.
Stone never surrenders to force. One
must seek out the latent form within
the stone and then it need only be
touched with the chisel, so—” a quick tap
of the edge of the hand, in air “and
the form will appear. I am the last
sculptor alive who knows how to carve
marble. The others treat the stone as if
it were cold. Tomb monuments. They
attack it and crush the crystals. But it is
such a live stone that it can only re-
taliate by going dead. Its being can only
be released by love.”
She learnt to carve marble as a student
in Italy. There she studied Etruscan,
Romanesque and Early Renaissance
sculpture (especially the carvings of
Niccolo Pisano). But she instinctively
recoiled from the High Renaissance:
most of all, from Michelangelo. “I detest
the rhetorical, and Michelangelo, like
Rodin, is a rhetorical sculptor. I do not
believe that he had a very articulate sense
of sculptural form.” And in this context,
the transcendently important moment of
Barbara Hepworth’s life came when, in
1954, she visited Greece for the first time.
“I remember standing on Patras,”
Barbara Hepworth said later, “and think-
ing—with that incredible stretch of sea
and islands before me—how intensely a
figure rising in the distance expressed
that perfect elevation of the human
spirit which in a way is conveyed by
powerful sculptured form. I felt that
the Greek idea had something of the
will, the power, the ruggedness we need
The whole content of Barbara Hep-
worth’s work is its sensuality. These
smooth, exquisitely shaped carvings,
with their hollows and caves, their
polished or vibrantly textured surfaces,
their surging contors, don’t merely invite
the touch of one’s hands: they demand
it.
“I was never so delighted,” Barbara
Hepworth told me, “as when my sculp-
tures came back from a retrospective at
the Whitechapel Gallery. They were
black with handprints, from people
touching and feeling them and black
in all the right places. The hand goes
instinctively to the form. I think it’s a
terrible mistake to treat sculpture as if
it were simply a thing to be looked at.”
We talked for a while about the prac-
tical difficulties of sculpture. “It’s a
most costly profession,” said Hepworth,


picking up a chisel. “This has a tungsten
bit. Every time'it breaks, it costs three
pounds. I suppose my expenses start at
£2OO a week, with the assistants I employ.
And then there are those embarrassing
gifts. For instance, a kind maharajah
sent me, not long ago, a present of
some very beautiful wood from India,
most exotic. The unfortunate thing was
that it cost me about £3OO to get the
load from Plymouth to here. Come out-
side, I want to show you my sheep.”
Puzzled, and vaguely remembering
that Barbara Hepworth had, in poorer
days, supported herself by market gar-
dening (but merinos in St Ives?), I fol-
lowed her into the studio yard. It was
piled with new blocks of Carrara, virgin
white. “They are like sheep, aren’t
they?” she said, running her hand over
one. “One reason why I live in St Ives
is that I can carve out-of-doors, all the
year round. That would be unthinkable
in London. It gets so cold that one’s
hands stick to the chisel. I must work in
the open air. One feels a continuity with
the landscape.”
The garden around Barbara Hep-
worth’s studio yard is full of sculpture.
Great bronzes, ten feet high, rise serenely
among the trees. Generally, the sight of
many sculptures crowded into a small
space has a depressing effect on me. Every
form generates its own space around it,
and these spaces and scales can clash,
producing an effect like bodies heaped
in a mortuary. Not so in Hepworth’s
garden. Each sculpture, large or small,
has a marvellous continuity of scale and
space with its neighbor.
As one walks among the sculptures m
this garden, or among the 50 or so more
which inhabit the St Ives Palais de Danse
across the road, which Hepworth recently
bought for a store-house, one becomes
aware of the urgent pressure of land-
scape. Each shape is an epigram of some
landscape experience, in Cornwall or
Greece.
“Nearly all my sculpture is related to
landscape,” Barbara Hepworth said, con-
firming my impression. “In fact, as you
will have seen, the sculptures sometimes
have quite specific titles ‘Sea Form,
Pcrthmeor’ and so on. They are about
this world.” Another precise gesture, the
hand arching to take in the curve of the
Atlantic and the curve of the moors
behind. “I see this as the aim of art:
to create an ideal structure which is
sensual, too. To give sensual coherence
a philosophic form. And that can only
be achieved through love. In the end,
my sculpture is about nothing except
love.”

the one hand, everyone said “Funny Girl” would be
nothing without Barbra Streisand. But, on the other
hand, there was Jill Perryman. Miss Perryman, with 13 years
in revue and musicals behind her and with nothing in her
demeanor to suggest that Williamson’s have done her a favor
in handing her the Fanny Brice part, walks or, rather
dances, runs, leaps, laughs, sings and shouts away with
the part.
Miss Perryman is ably supported by Evie Hayes as Mrs
Brice, by Bruce Barry as Nick Arnstein, the worthless man
in the life of the American comedienne, and Bill Yule as
her early theatrical partner and by a large and hard-working
cast.
However, it is probable that without Jill Perryman “Funny
Girl” wouldn’t be much. The story is scrappy and episodic,
tracing the life of Fanny Brice from 1910 to 1924, and making
heavy demands on the people back-stage and on the patience
of the audience. Music and lyrics are relentlessly and mech-
anically bright.

In the programme notes for Brazill’s
play, J.C.W.’s submit this forlorn list
as evidence of their vigorous and continu-
ing support for Australian plays. “Not
a bad tally!” they say. And to prove that
greater love hath no theatrical manage-
ment, they offer us the semi-legendary
Miss Googie Withers as leading lady.
Brazill’s Strindbergian opus is set on a
sheep station, where for 20 years haughty
Edith Cassidy has played Chopin while
yearning for the cultured lover who, hav-
ing impregnated her, mysteriously dis-
appeared. For the sake of respectability,
her father negotiated a marriage with
rough-diamond Joe Cassidy, on terms
which have embittered wealthy Her and
shamed poor-but-honest Him.
Finally enraged by her exclusive dream
world and contemptuous rejection of his
good intentions, Joe (underplayed by Ed
Devereaux) seeks out the lost lover, and
discovers his artistic tendencies have led
him irresistibly to the gutter. Joe at-
tempts to produce the derelict as shock
treatment for Edith’s delusions of ardor,
but she —a paradoxically strong-willed
and efficient woman—avoids the con-
frontation by contriving his suicide by
’phone. Whereupon (walking between
the mantelpiece and the piano) she goes
quite dotty; a transformation that even
Googie Withers’ heavyweight talent can-
not make plausible. It’s like watching
Lady Macbeth become Ophelia.
The high spot of the night concerned
the play’s snake, which is distantly re-
lated to Tennessee Williams’ metaphoric
iguana. A shotgun blast-off fanfared
the appearance of this length of lumin-
ous papier-mache—a metaphor indeed.
Like Brazill’s other characters, the rep-
tile was over-colored, unnaturally stiff
and could never have lived.
Patricia Napper is also concerned with
marriage difficulties, this time in a Mel-
bourne vicarage. The ramrod Rev. Ten-
nant and his wife Christina haven’t hit it
off for many years—since he learned that
she’d had an affair with (yes) an artist.
There’s almost a symbolic snake in this
play, tod —as the Rev. Tennant is much
concerned with original sin. But unlike
James Brazill, Miss Napper can write
good, glib dialogue, successfully counter-
points her drama with humor, and is re-
freshingly unpretentious.
PHILLIP ADAMS
PERTH FESTIVAL
Successful
“Voyage”
n unambitious presentation of
Romeo and Juliet” at the New For-
tune theatre has proved' to be among the
best the Perth Festival offered. The best
was Harold Lang’s Voyage Theatre
company’s “Macbeth in Camera” and
“A Sleep of Prisoners.” The Voyage
Theatre foursome were outstanding in re-
telling a discussion between three actors
and a Shakespearean scholar about inter-
pretations of Macbeth. Harold Lang
(producer, principal actor and author of
the dialogue) has interpolated fascinat-
ing segments of Shakespeare into a dis-
cussion turned into a play—with humor,
suspense and a happy ending. After
this, the group’s “A Sleep of Prisoners”
was an anti-climax, not because of the
acting of Christopher Fry's play, but be-
cause of the setting in St George’s Cathe-
dral, where only the first three or four
rows could see.
The festival organisers were wrong to
bill John Manifold as Australia’s leading
folk-singer, with all this implies. The
young bearded onqs who arrived, all
guitared up, were disappointed that this
wasn’t Peter, Paul and Mary. Instead
they were given a series of intense and
academic lecturettes on Australia’s bush-
ballad heritage, backed by unprofes-
sional music. “Porgy and Bess” was a
victim of over-exposure and poor acous-
tics. The New Zealand Opera Com-
pany ran second to a full-volume orch-
estra. Yet this was considered the com-
pany’s best season in Australia, and one
of the most popular evenings out of the
festival.
The Kalakshetra Dancers, on the
other hand, attracted small audiences
and enthusiastic reviews. Either you

other group, appreciation of which
depended largely on personal taste, al-
though in this case the more familiar
idiom was able to overcome, if only
partly, the problems of Greek dialogue.
Inevitably, the plain fare left the hap-
piest memories. And there was a simi-
larity between the most memorable film
of, the Festival —“Shop on the Main

were Jewish in overtone and delightfully
low-key. The film is the story of a
frightened little Czech’s valiant attempts
to save an old Jewish shopkeeper from
the Nazis. The hero was unheroic in
the extreme, and the film’s brilliance was
in fyuilding him in a slow crescendo from
comic to pathetic to heroic to a tragic
figure. David Kossoff served up a re-
markable goulash of corn-and-ego.

FILMS
Small-town
Kiss Me, Stupid. Director Billy Wilder. Town
Theatre, Sydney.
“IZTss Me, Stupid” has got itself more
publicity than it really deserves —
first, because its filming was interrupted
by the near-fatal illness of its star, Peter
Sellers; later because on release it was
widely castigated for vulgarity, if not
downright immorality. In fact, it turns
out to be nothing more than an inter-
mittently funny farce, containing some
harmless enough dirty jokes and situa-
tions —a mere extension of the sort of
variety sketch set in a bedroom with an
unlikely number of doors, behind which
husbands, wives and lovers can be hur-
riedly concealed or from which they can
embarrassingly appear. There is no-
thing pornographic in the film, nor is
there any of the frank, down-to-earth
bawdy of a Restoration comedy, or
even of Joe Martin.
It’s the story of the efforts of a small-
town songwriter to sell his compositions
to a popular singer stranded in town
overnight, while also keeping the singer
—famed as a lecher —away from his
own pretty wife. His solution of the
problem is to drive his wife from the
house by a trumped-up quarrel and to
introduce a local prostitute as his wife.
Somehow it doesn’t sound much like
Billy Wilder, nor does the film look
much like his work, lacking any of the
stylish wit of “The Apartment,” “Sunset
Boulevard” or “One, Two, Three.” Pos-
sibly the trouble is that Wilder is funda-
mentally a moralist, and there’s nothing
here for him to moralise about, since the
script accepts the situation without com-
ment and aims strictly for laughs. Kim
Novak gives a surprisingly likeable per-
formance, for once giving some mean-
ing to the stock role of the warm-
hearted, wistful whore; and Ray Wal-
ston, though much miscast, is lively
enough.

’66 And AH That. Channel 10, Sydney.
Diary of a Young Man. Channel 2, Sydney.
A s I have remarked often during the
past four years, the laughter of stu-
dio audiences is no guide to success or
failure of a new show. Neither are ap-
praisals made by the best of reviewers
who have seen a studio preview. “Fast
paced” was one term applied to Chan-
nel 10’s “’66 And All That”, before it
was televised. At home one would have
needed to keep running past the set to
gain any such impression. It had the
makings of a good show, but to para-
phrase some of its publicity, todays
viewers won’t accept the “makings” when
they can buy “tailor mades”.
“ ’66 And All That” could be im-
proved if Carol Raye realised it is not
yet a very clever, subtle show -and can-
not pretend it is until it is; if Mike
Walsh drops his “lazy charm” image and
projects something, anything; if the sket-
ches “satirise” more deserving targets
than Lifeline and suicides; and if “funny”
monologues have at least a few funny
lines.
While Miss l£aye and colleagues are
doing their homework, may I commend
a BBC serial which began on ABC
Television two weeks ago with no men-
tion that it is a very funny and moder-
ately bawdy atiair. Two Liverpool or-
phans come to London to find, if not
the good life, at least a better one. Joe
is sharp as a tack, Ginger amiably dim.

in the action of “Diary of a Young

BOOKS
Vintage Porter
By MAURICE SHADBOLT
The Cats of Venice. Hal Porter. Angus and
Robertson. $2.50.
FT\he best stories start from the claustro-
phobia of domestic interiors. Porter
tries on families the way some people
try on clothes; the difference is that he
always finds the fit perfect. As first per-
son narrator he shrinks or expands,
whichever is called for, into one dis-
guise after another in order to joust
with, and finally lance, the fears and
fancies of the human heart.
In “Francis Silver” the narrator hunts
down the supposedly tall and handsome
man who has haunted his dead mother’s
years of humdrum marriage, and finds a
short, fat lisper behind the counter of a
picture-framing shop—who can’t remem-
ber his mother. In “Flag Race” the
ageing narrator finds himself caught on
the relentless treadmill of generations,
behaving as cruelly to his daughter, in
defence of his mother, as his mother
once was to him, in defence of his grand-
father (“so that the dead will allow us
to forgive ourselves”); in the powerful
“First Love” the narrator, shrunken
again, falls furtively in love with a fancy-
dressed girl in a faded family photo-
graph, only to have his heart break when
his adored is identified at last as a boozy
aunt of 50.
But to bleed the flesh and bare the
bones is unfair. All the stories here
would fit Frank O'Connor’s prescrip-
tion: they can be summarised in four or
five lines, often much less. The quality
is in the telling. In the past I have
thought Porter’s style (particularly in
“A Bachelor’s Children”) too elabor-
ately self-regarding, spiralling away from
its subject in search of applause on its
own account or in frantic flight from
the boredom of narrative. The result was
more often a performance than a short
story. Now, without his earlier work
beside me, I’m still unsure whether
Porter has changed or I have. It is true
that the delight is in the texture of the
treatment, storytelling at its purest; but
Porter’s love of language this time seldom
distracts, rather it involves. For most of
the sixteen pieces here' are stories
with a point, and a narrative drive to-
wards that point and not occasions
for observation.
Porter succeeds where his material
confines him, where his characters are
relatively unsophisticated: often an
adolescent or family situation. Where
his people are more cosmopolitan (in
the title story, or in “Cafe Floria”) his
lack of control seems in direct proportion
to a lack of real purpose: the prose
swerves, sways and pirouettes as though
in an effort to conceal that it has nothing
which is not banal points too easily
scored to say about the situation in
hand. Obviously Porter enjoys this
material: enjoys it too much, perhaps,
to do anything with it. It is a character-
istically provincial weakness.
Porter is really much more at home
in a kitchen than a cafe. But his strength
is essentially and vitally that of a pro-
vincial, too: after this book can he have
the blurb-writer’s absurd tag of “cos-
mopolitan” again? (All I can suggest is
that Australians feel they ought to have
cosmopolitan writers by now, so Porter
has been invented for the category.)
One of his own sentences sums up Por-
ter nicely: “Not only could one not tell
a book by its cover, one could not
really! tell it by its contents.” Nor,
one might add for good measure, by its
title; this one positively misleads.
So, if that much is clear at last, what
are we left? With, we may hope, a
talented and tough-minded storyteller
who has not only discovered, but begun
to exploit, his real strength. It may be
significant that two of the best stories
here begin with the narrator flying
home called back by a death in the
family from Greece. If that is also
Porter’s direction as a writer, we can
feel reassured. To say that his stories
work best in or near domestic regions
is not to imply some crippling limita-
tion as a writer: at his finest he generates
some of the power and ambience of the
best Irish storytellers, particularly Frank
O’Connor (“First Love” is an O’Connor
title too), writers who have also made
the most and made art of pro-
vincial virtues. Porter’s wit may be drier
and harsher, but his comedy (in “Great-
aunt Fanny’s Picnic”) is occasionally
as wild as anything the Irish can boast.
His cold compassion, though, is all his
own; and all implicit in the telling
and in the choice, say, of the pathetic
old woman who is “The Letter Writer”.
Highway
Tireder and tireder we ride
our treadmill, whose tide,
surrendering to mud,
leaves the suburban shoreline littered
with oil, with rainbow-muck, the after-birth
of industry, walls rimed with scurf,
chipped pastel bungalows
and blackening factory,
till, unexpectedly, it bursts
into a golden grove,
a doomed oasis
marked for the Caterpillar tractor. We
look beyond the grove. There always is,
far out as boyhood,
an island schooner tangled in its palms
like a caught heron,
an oil-netted gull,
dying, like all anachronisms, beautiful.
A few more yards upshore
and it breaks free.
It paces the horizon
with us, bound to one law.
So wistfully, so swiftly left behind!
Free of the tired mind,
an innocence gone.
It haunts us like the moon.
Within that grove there’s one
uncertain, searching track that narrows
below the branches in their wrestler’s lock
towards a yellow, weather-beaten boathouse
sheltering snake-lit water, tired oars
the hollow, afternoon clink of an oarlock.
I’ve never dared that path. I never tried.
Too tired, too tired, I’d be afraid to feel
in the odour of hogplum and manchineel
the sour, lapping creek that the boy’s heart
had shrivelled black and dried.
I’ve come out of that wood.
The schooner’s out too far,
too far that boyhood.
The palm trees signal wildly to the car,
but I am bound elsewhere.
I cannot turn to see
the schooner, like a heron, take the air,
the moon break sail and fall.
The bravest of us all
surrenders safety to fear.
And why not? From this car
there’s terror enough in the habitual,
miracle enough in the familiar.

ATTENTION WRITERS!
U.S. magazine wants to buy true stories about
lost mines and lost, sunken or buried treasures

His craftsmanship is such that he can
spring surprise upon his reader without
a story flying apart: the paralysing con-
clusion of “Gretel”, where a few scraps
of conversation illuminate the terrible
beauty of an insane girl’s love, arises
from and refers back to everything which
has gone before, but still shocks. It is as
perfect and precise a story as anything
Porter has ever written, and interesting,
too, because few writers now would gam-
ble upon so simple and perilous a theme:
in its daring “Gretel,” like one or two
other pieces here, seems to echo its way
back through the entire history of the
short story and yet still stand on its own.
Precision is a word one is tempted to
overwork in discussing Porter. It is there,
not just in the language but in the often
exuberant observation: “The house was
so new that I felt paint-splashed shoes
still to be in the garage; there could
have been no time for corks and string
to overrun kitchen drawers . ..”
This is from “Party Forty-Two and
Mrs Brewer” which tells about a party
where a drunken char, from ier kitchen
stronghold, takes over a mixed gather-
ing of and Sydney sophisti-
cates; and in the end conquers all. One
is tempted to twist a moral out of it.
When Porter launches out from a family
kitchen, rather than a cafe, he too can
conquer.
First Voyage
I was a boy, with all a boy’s heart holds.
Under the young moon Java lay in sight,
The sea calm, like slowly heaving oil.
At the very end of moonlight’s track
The black loom of the Java coast was
there!
A lost, belated sea bird crossed our bow,
And headed toward the moonlight cause-
way; then
How faint and yet distinct the land-smell
came!
The breeze was soft and bore it like a gift.
Beware that scent, for deeply once inhaled
Not all your temperate winters, summers
clear
It from the mind. It calls you to come back.
Behind, the Indian Ocean stretched away
On into infinity. Not our concern.
Tomorrow, or the next day, Tjilatjap!
ERIC WRAY STAIGHT
The Dullness of Yevtushenko
By CHARLES HIGHAM
are poets whose reputations
remain hidden for a lifetime be-
cause of a refusal to indulge in pub-
licity stunts; there are others whose
merits are exaggerated to absurd de-
grees because of their personalities
and their positions in a specific society.
Yevtushenko belongs to the second
category. His enormous popularity as
a reader, his wide travels, and the ap-
parently still potent romantic appeal
of the Slav, have created a legend in
his short lifetime that his actual work
totally fails to sustain.
We are, of course, obliged to rely
on translation. At present, the only
edition available to the scholar in Aus-
tralia is the “Selected Poems” first pub-
lished by Penguin Books in 1962.
This has recently come out here again,
but not quite in time for Yevtushenko’s
arrival.
Geoffrey Dutton has announced
publication of a further selection in
Sun Books, which again did not quite
make it at the right moment; one
has to rely on the versions by Robin
Milner-Gulland and Peter Levi, S.J.,
in the Penguin edition.
The Penguin introduction suggests
that the poet’s distinction springs from
his youthfulness, his indifference to
the conflicts and tensions of an older
generation of Soviet poets which could
still recall the problems of the earlier
part of the century.
Youthfulness is scarcely in itself a
virtue, so an attempt has been made to
prop up the poet’s reputation with
further claims. Mr Dutton spoke of
“superb” qualities in the long poem
“Zima Junction”. The translators for
Penguin talk of freshness and inspira-
tion, of a lack ,of obscurity and of a
colloquial force in the writing. More
accurately they describe his work as
“middle-brow”. Perhaps inadvertently,
they strike the precise truth about him
in that single word.
The poems, in English, are slack,
prosaic and lacking in rhythmic power.
“Zima Junction” is a very long poem
which evokes the author’s life in a
small town, his relatives, his school-
days, and his emergence from youth.
It reads like chopped-up prose, full
of boring anecdotes and conversations,
devoid of a single striking image and
only tolerable at all because of its
directness and lack of pretension. The
later poems in the book are mostly
simple homilies (“telling lies to the
young is wrong”), or further evoca-
tions of Zima Junction (a hamlet which
must have been at least as dull as the
poet makes it seem), remembrances
of people met and lost, descriptions
of landscapes, and love poems.
The flavor of the writing is one of
gentle nostalgia, without edge and
without the fierce directness of the
best Russian poets like Pasternak and
Mayakovski. There is no real impact:
one fact is put down stolidly after an-
other, as in an essay, and no attempt
has been made to work lip the lan-
guage to an elevated pitch. There is
no rhetoric to speak of, and the drab
yoice rattles on incessantly about those
aspects of the Russian landscape
which are so tediously familiar from
film after film; remembered school-
mistresses, children and lovers.
I scarcely had one single care in the
world,
my life, presenting no big obstacles,
seemed to have few or simple com-
plications —
life solved itself without my con-
tributions.
/ had no doubts about harmonious
answers
which could and would be given to
every question.
But suddenly this felt necessity
of answering these questions for my-
self.
So 1 shall go on where 1 started from,
sudden complexity, self-generated,
disturbed by which 1 started on this
journey.
Into my native forest among those
long-trodden roads I took this com-
lication
to take stock of that old simplicity,
like bride and groom, a country
matchmaking.
So there stood youth and there child-
hood together,
trying to look into each other’s eyes
and each offending, but not equally.
Is there anything one can salvage?
Possibly. The freely moving fluency
and simplicity of the writing may be
impressive when read from the stage
by experienced actors. On the page,
it looks heavily obvious and un-
inspired. Mr Dutton’s collection may
well redress this view. One hopes so,
feeling that, while it can’t exactly be
said that a hoax has been perpetrated,
at least it can be confirmed that pub-
licity, in the present period, means a
good deal more than the private values
of art.

The Tendril and the Vine
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Far Field. Theodore Roethke. Faber and
Faber. $3.05.
A Need of Similar Name. Bruce Dawe.
Cheshire. $1.85.
Roethke’s “The Far Field”
-*■ was completed just before his death
in 1963 and it shows him continuing as
the “poet of confidence and joy” he has
always been praised for being. Roethke
was brought up among the greenhouses
and flowers of his family’s nursery and
an absorbed fascination with the processes
of growth and generation is characteristic
of his work. Where a Rilke or a Keats
is a poet of maturation and the achieved
calm of fruition, Roethke is the poet of
life on the move, of things seething,
sending down roots and burgeoning,
the surge of tendril and vine. His
tends to be a restlessly dynamic
world, though his later development
showed him moving into a somewhat
fixed and stylised phase of religious pre-
occupation (“The rose exceeds, the rose
exceeds us all”).
Roethke is a poet of great brilliance;
if many of his early strengths were
borrowed strengths, his actual derivative-
ness has been overstressed. Certainly
“Words for the Wind” was full of poems
that leaned heavily on Sir John Davies
and Yeats; many poems in “The Far
Field” show the influence of Eliot and of
Whitman, whom Roethke addresses as
the “maker of catalogues”. But Roethke
himself with characteristic honesty and
generosity was the first to acknowledge
an indebtedness which grew out of ad-
miration; his sense of the world included
a sense of how much he derived from
others and he had sufficient of the real
poet’s sense of security in his own talent
to freely admit what he owed. What is
overlooked is the degree to which he
successfully adopted what he borrowed
and how vigorously original the poems
about his family are. “Otto” in particular
remains one of his best poems with its
vivid, crisp, epigrammatic style.
It is surprising to recall that Bruce
Dawe was once recommended to us as a
poet of irony, or if I remember rightly
that he was once accused of hard-
headed toughness and compared with
Thom Gunn. Surprising, because Dawe
is not primarily an ironist and he is cer-
tainly not “tough”: his emotiona’ range
moves between tenderness and indig-
nation. The characteristic protests of
“Process” and “iCI Building” need to be
placed against the lush romanticism of
“Elegy for Drowned Children”, the mov-
ing “Comedian” and the popular-song
sentimentality of “Free-Will Offering”. A
good poem like “Two Ways of Consider-
ing the Fog” finds its strength between
these extremes: it makes its point with
clarity and conviction. Dawe is basically
a moralist who uses verse for social
observation and comment, though several
of his poems touch a poignant, elegaic
note: the insufficiency of things, a sense
of inadequacy; and perhaps the over-
statements and stridencies of some of his
protests are related to this sense. Never-
theless, irony serves Dawe well in “Burial
Ceremony” and especially in “A is for
Asia” his finest poem and one of the
most remarkable political poems written
in Australia.

The Return of Odysseus
.By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Report to Greco. Nikos Kazantzakis.
Cassirer. $4.15.
17' azantzAris’ famous novel is a huge,
incomplete autobiographical mosaic,
obviously intended to be on a major
scale, glittering with promise, but with
many of the significant pieces missing.
The early chapters have a Byzantine
splendor, dominated by the colorful,
oversized pirate figure of the author’s
father, Captain Michael, who terrorised
his childhood with such horrors as the
swirling yataghans of the Turkish mass-
acres and such sights as the hanging,
green-tongued corpses he was forced to
touch and the skull of his paternal grand-
father—or what the enemy had left of
it—displayed polished and anointed with
sanctified oil in a monastery.
But for those who know the magni-
ficent ringing verses of Kazantzakis’
own “Odyssey, A Modern Sequel”, the
rambling four-page poem to El Greco
in the “Report’s” Epilogue with lines
like “But the King, that venomous fig-
wort, ejects me from his dreary hen-
roost” can only appear pathetically em-
barrassing.
“Report to Greco” is Kazantzakis’ own,
final, spiritual Odyssey, retracing and
summing up the author’s lifelong mysti-
cal journeys towards enlightenment, be-
ginning with Christ, passing to Buddha,
dallying with Lenin and then returning
to Christ once more. It seems signifi-
cant,. however, that after carrying the
reader from Mount Athos over Mount
Sinai, through Nietzsche’s doctrinal terri-
tory to visions of Buddha under a blos-
soming tree, and after seeking God in
deserts and hilltops and finding Him
there, that he chooses to make his last
confession elsewhere. For this, he turns
to El Greco, whom he addresses as he
might a great totemic ancestor.
Yet anyone taking up this book under
the natural assumption that a work en-
titled “Report to Greco” has something
substantial to say about the painter him-
self —an impression the dustjacket’s de-
tailed head from the Toledo “St Bar-
tholomew” does nothing to mitigate—is
in for a disappointment. El Greco ap-
pears only in the Prologue and Epilogue
like a huge figurehead which the author,
this later Cretan, clothes with his own
ideas.
In tracing the fragments of the
author’s own life, one gains a very clear
insight into the factual origin of his fic-
tional inspiration: his waking vision of
Assisi is very much his dreaming vision
of St. Francis; his idea that Lucifer is
the Prodigal Son and necessary to God is
echoed in his conception of the essen-
tial balance between good and evil; the
temptations of Christ are very much
his own transmuted personal experiences.
For example, the strange affliction
that suddenly descends on Manolios
in “Christ Re-Crucified” had once
attacked young Nikos when on his way
to a girl. In the novel, Manolios the
shepherd who is chosen to play the
Christ-role in the Holy Week Passion
celebrations gradually assumes the
mantle of a modern, real-life Christ-
figure and the story culminates in his
actual “crucifixion” by hanging. In one
important chapter Manolios had decided
to “save” the seductive golden-haired
widow, the village Magdalene, but on
his way to her house is overcome by a
strange psychological allergy which swells
his face into a bloated leprous carica-
ture and he turns back. Thus Manolios
(like Nikos before him) is saved.
Perhaps Kazantzakis’ own philosophy
can best be understood from a newspaper
interview he gave some years ago when
he said that for him Odysseus was the
man who has tried all the forms of life
and cut away all the strings, freeing him-
self from everything—religions, philo-
sophies, political systems —and keeping
the thought of death before him, not
as a menace, but as a stimulant to
sharpen his appetite for living. From
this autobiography Kazantzakis could
have emerged not only as his own
Odysseus but as his own Homer, as well.
The tragedy was that he died before he
could complete the last stage of the
journey.
J. NORMINGTON RAWLING
We note with regret the death last week
of J. Normington Rawling, the author
of the life of Charles Harpur. Shortly
before his death he completed “Com-
munism Comes To Australia” —a history
of the Communist Party here from its
inception to 1940. It will be published
this year.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Sadness in Collins St
TT’S almost as if Sydney and Melbourne were in different countries. In the last week
or so, Melbourne-based leading companies have been reporting all sorts of gloom,
while the top Sydney ones have been either increasing their dividends or generally
putting on a cheerful —if a little cautious face.
There is evidence enough of this in
the retail trade, with the recession talk
from Melbourne-headquartered Coles
against the things-are-great noises from
Sydney-centred Woolworths; of caution
and lower profits from Melbourne’s
Myers and bigger and better things
from Sydney’s Waltons and Grace Bros.
There is further evidence in the mount-
ing number of NSW companies in all
industries that are able to keep up their
figures despite the drought, and the im-
posing list of Melbourne stocks that are
finding things difficult, or even making
losses for the first time in many years.
Why should business be so bad in
Melbourne and so good in Sydney? There
could be something in the suggestion
that NSW industry is more orientated
towards making capital goods, and that
the capital goods cycle is still in up-
swing because of its traditional lag be-
hind swings in the consumer industries.
And there can be no disagreement
that Melbourne is the centre of the
motor industry, which has not been too
healthy recently and which also is
one of the two major employers of labor
in Australia.
But all this seems hardly enough to
explain the staggering difference between
the sad sounds from Collins Street
during the latest weeks of the interim
company reports “season”, and the
better news from Sydney.
The reason could lie more in the field
of politics than in economics. There has
been some speculation why Sir Edgar
Coles chose to come to Sydney to make
an unscheduled statement about falling
sales, reduced expansion programmes
and all the rest of it, just three days
before Mr Holt got up to make his do-
nothing, “she’ll-be-right” speech on the
state of the economy last week.
It seems likely that Sir Edgar may
have had a fair idea that Mr Holt would
be doing nothing to stimulate the
economy, and if any statement was
aimed at frightening Mr Holt into doing
something, Sir Edgar’s was; it would
have had far more impact than the
normal complaints that followed it from
the ACTU on the same score.
But Mr Holt was unruffled. He has
remained so, it appears, although his
Government’s subsequent admission
through his Treasurer, Mr McMahon,
that something was to be done quickly
to stimulate the building tra3e through
the public sector could suggest some
success for the “stimulate or perish”
brigade.
One reason Mr Holt has not yet done
anything to kick the economy along
could be that he is determined not to
appear to kowtow to Collins Street; that
he may consider the present situation to
be something of a “try-on” and that he
must show Melbourne’s Liberal business-
men early in his spell at the Lodge that
they can dominate the new Prime Minis-
ter no more than the old. Their experi-
ence with him as Treasurer should have
shown them that, anyhow. As a poli-
tician of long standing, he has a fair
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Apart from additional Viet-
nam commitments the Prime Minister’s speech left the
state of the nation much where it was, after a very
perfunctory glance at the economic situation and a
still indirect approach to drought finance. Perhaps
there’s some consolation in knowing that Mr Holt
believes “the combination of favorable growth prospects
and stable economic and political conditions are proving
strongly attractive” to capital inflow . . . Mr R. J.
Hawke, for the unions, is presenting his meticulous
review of the economy to the Arbitration Commission,
arguing that the basic wage should be adjusted on a
prices plus productivity basis; he suggests the Com-
mission must ignore the drought’s economic effects...
Wool prices continued to move upwards, but the
estimated clip for 1965-66 will be about 13 p.c. below
the previous year’s . . . New bank lending and over-
draft limits dropped back in February, although a
high proportion of new loans was made to farmers
and the rural sector is using 78.2 p.c. of its overdraft
limits . . . Listed Australian companies raised $104.1
million new money during the December quarter 1965,
compared with $79.1 million in the September quarter
... A survey of stocks held by a sample of 738 public
companies put them 13 p.c. higher in value for 1965
than they were in 1964, producing the second highest
absolute total in 11 years.
For the markets: Australian share markets
certainly roused themselves towards the end of last
week. They still have many doubts to contend with,
however, and it will need more than a few falls of
rain to resolve these. Over the week Mr Holt’s state-
ment and contradictory appearances in the retail trade
did not provide much help. Yet more buyers were
obvious on Thursday and Friday; they brought par-
ticular interest to a fairly wide spread of laggard base-
metals, sending the sectional index up with a 39 points
jump. Leading industrials as well were not reluctant
to go ahead after an interval of rather drab attention.
With all this general improvement the “all ordinaries”
index could do no better than lose 3.43 points on the
week: the exchanges are hardly out of the wood . . .
Election jitters are sure to seize London from time to
time as the campaign unwinds. Last week steel shares
took the plunge following announcement by the Chan-
cellor that the Labor Government might alter com-
pensation terms when steel is re-nationalised. Perhaps
the relative steadiness of sterling gave some kind of
a balance, since the rest of the market, though nervous,
did not move broadly; most equity falls were slight.
Improved February trade figures should furnish some
help this week . . . Higher interest rates have put a
decided mark upon Wall Street, though a couple of
days were capable of technical rallies. What to do with
an inflation remains a prime talking point.
For Companies * The debate on an allegedly
reluctant retail trade was given a further twist last
week. Following G. J. Coles’ proclaimed downturn,
Woolworths hopped in quickly to report “satisfactory”
sales increases for December-February and no halt in

idea of when businessmen are playing
politics.
But the important thing now is for
Mr Holt not to let things get as bad as
Melbourne already claims they are in
the economy simply because he wants
to show Collins Street that he is the boss.
He has made his point; the Melbourne
Liberals are suitably angry; now he can
get on with the things the country needs.
An immediate nudge along for the
economy is top of the list.
Invasion Beer
last big fright received by Victoria’s
A brewing monopoly, Carlton and
United Breweries Ltd, came from Char-
rington’s of the UK. The wealthy British
brewer was keen to establish a Victorian
plant a few years ago and made a
thorough investigation of the local mar-
ket. The chief factor in the final decision
to stay home was the strong Carlton and
United grip on Victorian hotel freeholds.
So many hotels were tied to CUB pro-
ducts that Charrington’s felt it would
have been too risky to invest the $lO
million necessary to set up in competition.
The new threat foaming on CUB's
horizon comes from across the Pacific.
Word has been out for some time that the
giant US brewer, Schlitz, is rather taken
with Australia’s beer-drinking habits and
would be willing to consider partnership
with Sydney’s R. W. Miller in establish-
ing a brewery in Victoria.
Carlton and United’s answer to these
threats, apart from maintaining the com-
mendable quality of its beer, is to keep
buying up hotel freeholds whenever they
are available and to offer mortgage
moneys at low interest rates to hotel pro-
prietors.
At present CUB owns more than 130
of the State’s 1500 or so hotels. Most of
these company hotels are in the heavy
selling class but there is still a large poten-
tial market for a rival brewer with plenty
of investment capital.
CUB is also understood to be negotia-
ting at the moment for two suburban
and one country hotel, each of them
with a heavy bar and lounge trade. One
of these suburban hotels has already
been approached by R. W. Miller and a
keen bidding duel for its freehold is
likely.
If Miller and Schlitz decide to take on
CUB, Miller will have to test the local
reaction to its beer in the near future.
The purchase of a hotel with a good
lounge trade will be the first step. The
next step will involve breaking down the
strong, though now unwarranted, Vic-
torian prejudice against “that Sydney
beer”.

The Impact of H. G. Palmers
By MICHAEL BAUME
'IiyHETHER or not debenture holders get
” paid in full is a relatively unim-
portant issue compared with the social
and economic impact of the H. G.
Palmer disaster.
It is the impact on other companies—
and even on the economy as a whole —•
that makes the latest s2sm. increase in
losses of H. G. Palmer (Consolidated)
Ltd to a staggering $34 million, so im-
portant.
The ripples of Palmer will effect not
only The MLC Ltd, whose inexplicable
involvement in this incompetently-
managed, self - deluding, chaos - creating
monster that seriously damaged the
fabric of the Australian electrical
appliance industry, will cost it millions
of dollars and will cost its policy-
holders millions too.
Apart from The MLC, which has
lost the slBm. it invested in Palmers’
capital, the main loss is being suffered
by those people who lent Palmer money
on deposit or on unsecured notes, with
$l3 million going down the drain this
way. Another $4 million has been lost by
creditors mainly appliance makers
who supplied the company with its stock.
The effect of the loss of depositors’
money is most important on such in-
tangibles as investors’ confidence. Coming
after so many other disasters, the Palmer
loss is a s34m. reason why investors
have left the stock exchange and are
putting their money back into the
savings banks and the building societies.
It is frightening to consider the social
consequences of the tremendous losses
the small investor has suffered in the
company crashes of the ’6os.
The industries most heavily hit by the
Palmer loss after the appliance makers
were newspaper, television and broad-
casting companies which together lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
Palmer crash. They did not only com-'
prise the big metropolitan dailies, who
dropped their $40,000 and $60,000 with
more aplomb than some of the small
country newspapers or radio stations
which could not only ill afford to lose a
few thousand dollars in Palmer’s bad
debts, but who also had relied heavily on
regular ads from Palmer’s stores that
have now been closed down.
Those companies that were caught
heavily as unsecured creditors will, of
course, suffer most; but the whole ap-
pliance trade will feel the impact one
way or another, even those sections
having little at stake in Palmers itself.
For some companies, such as Simp-
son Pope, the Palmer bad debt of
$624,000 is horrifying, particularly in
the context of last year’s profit of only
$601,000. Kelvinator’s bad debts with
Palmer’s of $198,000 is also very large
in relation to the group’s total profit last
year of $789,000, and even Email’s loss
of $141,000 is large against last year’s
profit of $1,203,000.
And then there were companies like
KGH Pty Ltd in Sydney, run by Mr
Keith Harris (not the essences man),
which had made a very large proportion
of the “H. G. Palmer” brand radio and
television sets sold through the group.
Not only has KGH lost its main cus-
tomer, it has also lost a bad debt to
Palmer’s of $44,638 and all this at
a time when the company had been
thinking about floating onto the Stock
Exchange lists. The Palmer bust-up
means that KGH is all but dismembered.
Many other manufacturers will also be
suffering from production downturns for
quite some time, if only that they won’t

Should the receiver continue to keep
the company going? He says he must, as
a forced realisation would bring even
greater losses in assets values than those
he revealed last week, which were all
based on Palmers as a going concern.
These figures showed that the value
of assets covered debenture claims by
$2 million, but it is clear that the very
heavy trading losses since June 30 last
have more than wiped out that. Not
only have unsecured creditors lost all the
$17.2 million owing to them, but deben-
ture holders may be losing a bit of their
$41.7 million, too.
There is no guarantee that the receiver
will be able to do better by trying to
keep trading than by just taking his loss
now; he could end up with two losses
(on trading as well as on realisation)
instead of one.
And in addition, if he stopped now,
he could have the $4.6 million mainten-
ance charges paid in advance, by cus-
tomers (an unsecured debt) to use for
satisfving debenture holders. By trading
on, the receiver is running down this
amount that would' be available. In
effect, the receiver is gambling on getting
the best of both worlds; he is slowly
winding the company up by selling off
its assets as he can. but not in “forced
sales”. He stands to gain more this way
but also runs the risk of losing more.
For creditors, the sight of the $4.4
million that have been paid in tax over
the last 12 years (w'hen the company
can now be shown never to have made
a real profit in its life) must be galling.
There seems a good case for the Taxa-
tion Commissioner actually paying back
the tax in such cases so that creditors
can benefit, rather than leaving a tax
credit with the company that share-
holders may eventually exploit (at a dis-
count. if sold) but not creditors.

Finding Aluminium Exports
Are Treasury forecasts too optimistic?
By J. G. HARDY
Ane of the major reasons for Treasury
confidence about the future in the
recent White Paper was that it expected
Australia to earn at least $420 million
a year from mineral exports by 1970.
A large part of this would, it was ex-
pected, be made up of $6O million worth
of exports of bauxite, alumina and
aluminium.
This may look all very comforting, but
the chances of reaching the Treasury’s
bauxite-alumina-aluminium export target
seem very slim indeed. The Treasury
appears to be taking a remarkably
optimistic view that cannot be justified
from present indications either of world
supply and demand or Australian pro-
duction over the next four years.
It seems most unlikely that Australia
will be able to earn much of this $6O
million from bauxite itself, for the world
demand for bauxite is likely to increase
by only about 1\ million tons by 1970,
and most of that should be taken up by
the traditional mining countries. For
bauxite, the threat is one of a surplus
in world trade by then. Alumina is the
likely candidate for making up the bulk
of this $6O million, as Australian
capacity should be enough by 1970 to
provide about $4B million worth of
alumina for export if that capacity were
J used to the full. Once again this depends
on an uncertain world trading situation.
The difficulties in trying to get a global
picture of the aluminium industry lie
in the international ramifications of inter-
woven companies, which do not know
national boundaries, and in the three-
stage development process from
aluminium hydrates (conveniently lumped
together under the name of bauxite) to
primary aluminium, which should be,
but is not always produced from alumina.
In Germany, for instance, up to 75 p,c.
of “primary aluminium” has been, at
times, resmelted aluminium scrap.
By rounding figures somewhat, a
reasonably accurate world production
picture for primary aluminium can be
obtained, showing that output rose from
4.5 million tons in 1960, to 4.6 m. in
1961, to sm. in 1962, to 5.5 m. in 1963
and to 6.1 m. in 1964. This is an increase
of 33.6 p.c. in four years. Most experts
believe that a growth rate of 8 p.c. per
annum will prevail for the next decade,
or at least till 1970, to lift production
to about 9.7 million tons by then. As
world consumption of primary aluminium
has risen since the end of the war by
600 p.c., but since 1950 by not quite
300 p.c., a slow-down of the rapid ex-
pansion could be expected.
Not less than 90 p.c. of total produc-
tion of primary aluminium is carried
out by only 12 giant companies, some
of them (i.e., the West German and the
Russian) under State control. The

p.c. of world production. The other
shares according to countries are USA
38 p.c., Canada 12.6 p.c., France 5.2
p.c., Japan 4.4 p.c., Norway 4.3 p.c.,
and West Germany 3.6 p.c. The total
of these seven countries leaves 15.5 p.c.
to the other twelve smelting nations, four
of which (Australia, Cameroons, Brazil
and Mexico) have joined the ranks since
1950.
World production of bauxite increased
by 21.6 p.c. between 1960 and 1964,
increasing from 26.8 million tons in 1960
to 28.6 m. in 1961, tc 30m. in 1962, to
29.5 m. in 1963, to 32.6 m. in 1964. Pro-
jections of bauxite production for 1970
(to stay with the Treasurer’s White Paper)
range to more than 50 million tons on
the basis of an 8 p.c. growth rate, but
actual output needed to meet forecast
aluminium demand seems more likely to
keep close to 40 million tons. This
tonnage of bauxite, together with the in-
creasing use of aluminium scrap, would
be ample for the refining of, say, 9.7
million tons of pure aluminium in 1970.
The important aspect for Australia is
that this would mean that between 1964
and 1970 only about 7i million tons
extra bauxite would be needed in the
world, and a lot of people are ready
to grab a slice of it.
Tf demand for bauxite grows no faster
than 5 p.c. a year (a reasonably high
target in view of the large scrap usage),
the expected production of “newcomers”
would drive towards a surplus and this
brings Australia hard up against realities
and the Treasurer’s forecast.
What chance has Australia of export-
ing -appreciable quantities of primary
aluminium in 1970? Very little, it seems,
using the knowledge of existing and
planned smelter capacity in Australia on
the one hand and a conservative pro-
jection of home demand for primary
aluminium (100,000 to 110,000 tons) on
the other.
In 1970 Gladstone should be able to
produce the planned 600,000 tons of
alumina and Kwinana about 400,000
tons. At least 200,000 tons of this must
be fed into the Australian smelters to
produce the projected quantity of prim-
ary aluminium, which leaves 800,000
tons of alumina open for export. If this
quantity could be sold completely *a
very optimistic suggestion), it would
mean about s4Bm., at current prices,
export income, giving Australia a 4i p.c.
share of world production in 1970. The
question of how far this assumption is
realistic leads to the export of bauxite,
which, in order to lift exports to the
s6om. calculation of the Treasurer, must
bring in sl2m. a year, equivalent to
something like 2im. tons at current
prices. This would also represent about
4i p.c. of world output. About a quarter
of this would be made up of sales already
negotiated with Japan through Comalco
Industries (Hong Kong) Pty Ltd and a
subsidiary of Alcan-Nippon Light Metal.
But export markets would still have to
be found for up to H million tons of
bauxite. There is no point in hoping
for exports out of Gove, because
Alusuisse has most categorically stated
that no bauxite will be sold, for the
simple reason that the quality is not good
enough to stand the freight.
There is, of course, always the chance
that new aluminium smelters will be built
in Australia between now and 1970,
apart from those m the pipe-line. It takes
two years to put up such a plant after
and this is the rub a cheaper source
of power than thermal generation has
been found. A possible answer may be
in the wild mountains of Manapouri on
the South Island of New Zealand, where
the New Zealand Government is build-
ing a hydro-electric complex which will
produce about the cheapest power in
the world. Comalco (50 p.c. Kaiser-
USA and 50 p.c. Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia) has an option for this project
to be exercised not later than 1968. A
welter of speculation and rumors has
surrounded these plans.
The United States imports today 55
p.c. more aluminium than is produced
at home. Smelter capacity rose in 1964
by only 3 p.c., whereas demand jumped
by 9 p.c. West Germany’s production
is covering less than p.c. of consump-
tion, and France, Austria, Switzerland
and Sweden are all heavy importers. The
most spectacular growth must be ex-
pected in the industrialised countries
where the per capita consumption is still
well below the American level of 33 lbs
per year, The rate in 1964 was 21.3 lbs
for Switzerland, 19.6 lbs for the United
Kingdom, 19.1 lbs for West Germany,
12.3 lbs in France and 7.7 lbs in Italy.
The expansion of the aluminium in-
dustry is closely linked with highly
developed countries.

Report
EXCERPTS FROM DIRECTORS'
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT,
FEBRUARY, 1966.
PRODUCTION
Company’s main plants have con-
tinued to operate at levels close to
capacity. In the half year ended 30th
November last, steel ingot production of
2.8 million tons was 9% higher than in the
corresponding period of the previous year
and 11.7% higher compared with the
previous six months. On the same basis
output of pig iron at 2.2 million tons rose
by 8.1% and 12.4% respectively.
r DEMAND
A T the Annual General Meeting share-
holders were informed that there were
indications of an easing in demand for
some types of steel. Since then and par-
ticularly during the last two months these
indications have become quite marked. All
of the causes are not clearly defined. In
the automobile and primary production
fields there has been a reduction in steel
consumption. This coupled with our in-
crease in production has probably caused
some customers to decrease their steel
stocks.
A further factor is that substantial steel
imports in the form of rolled products and
manufactured goods, such as motor cars,
are coming into Australia particularly from
Japan and the prices for rolled products
must show a very low return to the overseas
producer. These imports coupled with the
effects of the severe drought have affected
the demand for products of our largest
customer John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd. and
that company has consequently reduced its
demand on us.
The last occasion on which our capacity
substantially exceeded the local demand was
in 1962 but at that time export markets
were readily available at reasonable prices
and we did not find it necessary to reduce
output. In this regard the current position
is quite different. Many countries have
surplus steel capacity and are putting heavy
selling pressure on world markets. Although
export outlets are being vigorously pursued
by our Overseas Division, we are finding
that in most markets the available business
is being negotiated only at prices which
heavily discount the returns on
domestic sales.
We are therefore facing the possi-
bility that during the remainder of the
financial year it will be difficult to keep
all sections of our plants operating at
capacity levels.
It is in accordance with past experi-
ence in the steel industry for demand
to fluctuate sharply so that a period
of a shortage of capacity is followed
by one of a shortage of demand. In
planning for the future it is necessary
to take a long term view and despite
the present situation we are confident
that the demand for steel in Australia will
continue to rise.
DEVELOPMENT AND
CONSTRUCTION
JQEVELOPMENT and construction activity
is continuing at a high level throughout
the group.
At Port Kembla, the new high-speed
pickle line has been commissioned.
Other works completed at Port Kembla
include the small and fine coal cleaning
plant, modification to the No. 1 Power
Station, No. 4 Tinplate Shearline and an
additional row of soaking pits. Improve-
ments to the rail finishing section have
already brought about substantial increases
in production of rails and we are geared
to meet the increased demand arising from
major developmental projects in Australia.
Work on No. 4 Coke Ovens Battery is
proceeding on schedule and should be com-
pleted in August.. Other projects in hand
include the installation of a second stand
at the 140 in. Plate Mill, the conversion of
the Slab Mill to a universal type mill and
the relining of No. 2 Blast Furnace. The
necessary preliminary investigations are now
in hand for the building of No. 5 Blast
Furnace.
Substantial improvements to the New-
castle wharves have been carried out and
the steel strapping line at the Cold Rolling
Mill is almost complete.
At Whyalla, No. 2 Blast Furnace was
blown in last October. The new furnace
has a 26 foot hearth, and a rated capacity
of 1,700 tons of iron per day. No. I Fur-
nace is now being relined and will shortly
be recommissioned. With both blast fur-
naces operating and with additional oxygen
plant and other facilities now being in-
stalled, steelmaking capacity at Whyalla
will rise from 500,000 tons to nearly one
million tons per annum by the second half
of next year. The universal beam mill
should be completed by September of this
year, while construction of the two coke
ovens batteries and associated by-product
plant has commenced. Preliminary site work
for the 1.5 million tons per annum pellet
plant is now being carried out.
At Kwinana, foundation work is well
advanced on the blast furnace and power
station sites and jetty piling is under way.
Design work on the sinter plant is pro-
ceeding.
The introduction of longwall mining at
Kemira Colliery, on the South Coast of
New South Wales, last June has proved an
outstanding success.
On the Northern Coalfields, the com-
pletion of 2,000 ton storage bins at Bur-
wood and Stockton Borehole Collieries has
enabled all coal from our Northern Col-
lieries to be transported to the steelworks
in our own 60 ton rail trucks, with
economies in transport costs.
RAW MATERIALS AND
EXPLORATION
JT has previously been reported to share-
holders that our interest in exploration
work in Bass Strait has resulted to date in
two agreements between our wholly-owned
subsidiary. Haematite Explorations Ply. Ltd.
and Esso Explorations Australia Inc., a sub-
sidiary of Standard Oil Company, New
Jersey.
Nearly six years ago your company
obtained permits to explore for hydro
carbons over a major portion of Bass
Strait, such permits being arranged with
the Tasmanian, Victorian and South Aus-
tralian Departments of Mines. Following
preliminary magnetometer and seismic sur-
veys carried out by your company over the
whole area, three promising areas were
defined and identified respectively as the
Gippsland, Bass and Otway basins in which
closer seismic studies were conducted.
With the assistance of experts from over-
seas, conditions of tender were prepared
for the Gippsland basin and issued to a
number of oil companies who had expressed
interest in the area. Esso Explorations was
the successful tenderer and was prepared to
fully meet the conditions laid down by us
and accordingly an agreement was made
with them under which they were to drill
to “basement” five exploratory wells in this
particular basin at their cost. In the event
of a discovery in any one structure
Haematite Exploration has the option of
electing within a defined period to take
either a 12i% royalty or a 50% working
interest in relation to that structure.
(Continued on facing page)


As already reported to shareholders, Esso
commenced drilling in the Gippsland basin
in December, 1964, and to date have com-
pleted four wells in this basin, three of
which are defined as exploratory wells (two
of them also “discovery” wells) and one
as a “step-out” well which was put down
in the Gippsland Shelf area where the first
discovery was made. Subsequently tenders
were called for the Bass Basin and a second
agreement was made with Esso, which Com-
pany was again the successful tenderer on
conditions which were satisfactory to us,
and which were similar to those agreed for
the Gippsland Basin. Drilling commenced
at Bass in July of last year and to date one
well has been completed as a “dry” hole
and a second well is to be drilled shortly.
Your Directors consider it desirable that
there be continued Australian participation
to the fullest extent possible in the develop-
of such natural assets and it has been
decided to take up our option of a 50%
working interest in the Gippsland shelf
structure where a substantial reserve of
hydro carbons (gas and distillate) has been
proved. This election was made on the
understanding that the gas can be sold at
a price which both Esso and your company
regard as satisfactory. The risks and ex-
penditure involved in the search for hydro
carbons are of a high order and it is only
when a commercial discovery is made that
these can be recouped.
The field will undoubtedly be of great
value to consumers of gas in Victoria but
until marketing arrangements can be
agreed which are equitable to all parties,
and adequately recognise the enterprise
and capital investment of the companies
responsible for the discovery, development
cannot be put in hand.
It is interesting to record that prior to
your company entering into the agreements
with Esso it had spent almost two million
dollars on the initial seismic work which
attracted $520,000 of Commonwealth sub-
sidy. Since they have commenced drilling
Esso have spent a very much larger sum.
Following the lifting of the ban on the
export of Yampi ore, a shipment of iron
ore from Koolan Island has been made
to the Japanese steel industry and a second
shipment is about to be made. This ore,
together with further shipments to be
made shortly, will be used for large scale
production tests to establish whether or
not it is suitable for Japanese operating
conditions.
An agreement has been reached between
our subsidiary Dampier Mining Co. Ltd.
and Cliffs Western Australian Mining Co.
Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of Cleveland Cliffs
Iron Co. of America, for the sharing of
facilities for the production and shipment
of iron ore and pellets from adjoining
deposits at Deepdale in Western Australia.
The joint project will include a township
adjacent to the iron ore deposits of both
companies, a standard gauge railway line
to Cape Preston, a port township and deep-
water port facilities at Cape Preston where
Cliffs Western Australian Mining Co. Pty.
Ltd. will also establish a pelletising plant
with an initial capacity of at least 3.6
million tons of pellets per annum. Dampier
Mining Co. Ltd. has the right to have
the pelletising plant extended, within
limits, to meet our needs for pellets else-
where in the organisation or for export.
Quarrying and marketing will be carried
out independently by the two companies,
and as a result of discussions which have
been taking place for some time there are
prospects of us selling pellets to Japan at
reasonable prices.
On the iron ore field at Koolyanobbing,
in Western Australia, township and service
facilities are almost complete and work is
proceeding on crushing plant and loading
bins.
The construction of ore mining, ship-
loading and township facilities at Groote
Eylandt is proceeding satisfactorily and the
first shipment of manganese ore is to be
made during March. Additional plant is
being installed to meet augmented require-
ments for two furnace operation at Bell
Bay, Tasmania, and to provide tonnage for
export. Some overseas sales are being
negotiated for shipment during the latter
half of this year.
Work is nearing completion on the
quarry site, and on the rail and shipping
facilities at Coffin Bay in South Australia
and it is anticipated that production of
limesand will commence about mid-year.
SHIPBUILDING
T he 49,000 ton d.w. bulk carrier “Dar-
ling River”, the largest vessel yet built
in Australia, was launched in December.
The ship is 690 ft. long, with a beam of
104 ft. and was designed at The Whyalla
Shipbuilding and Engineering Works. She
is the first of four similar vessels to be
built and will go into service with the
Australian National Line in April.
It is pleasing to note that new techniques
now in use and the excellent work of our
shipyard organisation and management
have brought about substantial increases in
efficiency, with a consequent shortening of
construction times.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
(COMMONWEALTH STEEL CO. LTD.
maintained its total level of sales
during the period. Demand for heavy
products, notably for railway tyres and
wheels, has been strong, and new equip-
ment has resulted in improved output and
deliveries. A decline in demand from the
automobile industry towards the end of
the period adversely affected special steel
production. Owing to a continued rise in
imports, output of stainless steel flat
products again declined, despite rising
Australian consumption. For the financial
year to June, 1965, 57% of the total Aus-
tralian requirements of stainless steel flat
products was imported compared with 33%
in 1962. The imports have been marketed
at such depressed prices that the Common-
wealth Steel Company has made application
for emergency tariff protection.
The major expansion programme of this
Company is proceeding as planned. New
heat treatment facilities and the 50 ton
electric furnace, which will displace the
existing open hearth furnace, are almost
complete. At Unanderra, the bright an-
nealing line for stainless coil and strip
should be commissioned in May.
The Australian Wire Industries Pty.
Ltd. group of companies continues to ex-
perience reduced demand for wire and wire
products, partly as a result of the drought
and lower farm incomes and partly as a
result of reduced industrial demand. No
early improvement is in sight. New wire
drawing machines and a wire ropery have
been commissioned at the Geelong plant of
Rylands Bros.
The Titan Manufacturing Co. Pty.
Ltd. again' recorded higher output and
sales, despite unfavorable market con-
ditions in the automotive and primary
industries.
Production at the Tasmanian Electro
Metallurgical Co. Pty. Ltd. has been at
record levels. Construction of the second
ferro manganese furnace is making good
progress and is due for completion in
November. This furnace will enable us to
take care of all demands for ferro man-
ganese in Australia and there will be a
surplus for export.
RESEARCH
'J’HE Company has been fortunate in
securing the services of Dr R. G. Ward,
M.A., Ph.D., who has been appointed
Director of Research and who will take up
his position in Melbourne within the next
two or three months.
SHIPPING
November the Company took
delivery of a second charter vessel to
assist in carrying iron ore from Yampi
Sound to the East Coast. This vessel, the
“Iron Cavalier” of 35,000 tons d.w., is a
sister ship of the “Iron Clipper” chartered
in 1964. The arrival of the “Iron Cavalier”
on the coast coincided with an easing de-
mand for iron ore and also for coastal
shipping generally and it was possible to
voyage charter both ships for the carriage
of coal to Japan on a profitable basis.
LABOR
major works have again experienced
shortages of labor and high rates of
turnover. There were, however, some
indications of improvement towards the
end of the period.
In the 21 months during which the
Company’s overseas labor recruiting cam-
paign has been operating, 700 tradesmen
and 1,600 unskilled men from Britain have
joined the three major works. In addition,
93 professional and sub-professional men
have been brought to Australia.
Under our staff training programme,
about 1,300 employees are undergoing
tertiary education and apprentices number
more than 2,500.
On behalf of the Board,
COLIN SYME,
Chairman.

PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
The Directors of PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
advise that the following announcements were
made to the Australian Stock Exchanges and
Press on the 9th March, 1966.
APPOINTMENT OF GOLD MINING CONSULTANTS
Planet Mining Company Pty., Limited, a fully
owned subsidiary of Planet Oil Company N.L.,
advises that Messrs. John Taylor & Sons of
London have been appointed gold mining con-
sultants to the Company.
A detailed investigation of the 9,000 square
miles of the old Victorian goldfield areas held
by the Company under licence is in progress.
Messrs. John Taylor & Sons are consultants to
the Indian and Mysore Governments, and have
for 85 years been associated with the technical
management of the Kolar Goldfield in India
which is one of the largest in the world.
Senior resident personnel will arrive in Aus-
tralia this month.
An office has been opened in Melbourne.
The Planet concessions cover:—
The Ballarat East Goldfield
Trentham-Blackwood Belt

Part of Cassilis-Haunted River Belt
WOODBERRY No. 1 WELL
Woodberry No. 1 Well, a stratigraphic test five
miles east of Maitland in the Sydney Basin, has
been continuously cored to 2,002 feet and is at
present in marine shales and siltstone.
The well is being drilled to test for porosity
with a diamond drilling rig fitted with blow-
out preventors.
GIPPSLAND
In Gippsland, Planet Oil Company N.L. has
already earned a 10% interest in the Woodside
Group's onshore concession and is currently
earning a similar interest offshore.
Woodside's Dutson Downs No. 1 Well, to which
Planet is contributing, was spudded on the Bth
March, 1966.
MARKET POINTERS
Doing Worse than the Index
London-Australia takes a tumble
By JASON
The harder ypu try to make money in
the market the worse you do. That
seems to be the moral from the results
of the professionals who manage Aus-
tralia’s large number of investment
companies and unit trusts, which in
general did worse than the stock ex-
change index last year.
Many investors would have done
better to stick their money in equal
amounts across every stock on the mar-
ket than to put their money into the
trust of the pros. One reason for this
worse than average result from these
professionals is that there is something
of a herd instinct among the paid risk-
takers. The stocks they are interested in
probably suffer unreasonably from their
group swings in taste.
Among the many examples of invest-
ment companies doing worse than the
index, despite much harder trying (as
indicated by increased management
costs, up 26 p.c. and presumably in
brokerage), is the London Australia In-
vestment Co. Ltd., a member of the
AUC-lan Potter “stable”. The market
value of London-Australia’s listed
portfolio dropped 16.4 per cent during
1965 according to the recent balance
sheet, although its book value dropped
by only 2.7 per cent through disposals.
At the same time the share price index
fell by 11.3 per cent. It seems, therefore,
that the company’s net portfolio prob-
ably fell by about 14 per cent still
worse than the market.
In the long run, the company’s worse-
than-average effort for 1965 may have
prepared the way for a better-than-
average performance for, as a result of
share disposals, the company had
770,528 dollars at call or fixed interest
at the end of December waiting to take
advantage of the buying opportunities it
felt may turn up. Nevertheless it is strik-
ing that the company’s investment policy
appears to have been changed in the last
two years, not only in its attitudes to
various industries but also in contracting
its spread of shares to 124 companies
the lowest number for seven years.
Food and tobacco shares continued
the most favored in the portfolio,
taking 10.8 per cent of the total by
market value, followed by banks and hire
purchase stocks. Representation in coal
and power, mining, steel and allied in-
dustries was increased at the expense of
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, elec-
trical, engineering and machinery, tex-
tiles and clothing.
Stocks tossed out holus-bolus were
Advertiser Newspapers, A. G. Healing,
Amalgamated Chemicals (any regrets?),
Carlton Brewery and Melbourne Co-
operative Brewery, Cemac, CAGA,
CIG, EMI, Ernest Hiller, FMC, Ger-
rard, Harris Scarfe, Hopkins Odium,
John Mcllwraith, McDonald Industries,
C. J. Nilsen, SA Portland Cement, Swift
and United Empire Box.
The Pye holding of 60,000 shares and
John A. Gilbert holding of 22,000 50c
shares are almost disposed of; parcels
of Dodge and Herald and Weekly Times
have been halved; 15,000 Dunlop $2
shares were sold (leaving 75,000, to be
sure), and it looks as if the nod has been

managed to get out of 1100 Second
Century Corporation, the Melbourne in-
vestor and financier, before it went into
receivership. There are 21,900 still in the
portfolio. It also still holds 53,500
Bebarfalds shares and 10,000 A. J.
Benjamin notes.
Rights to issues in AGC, BHP, CSR,
O. T. Lempriere and Repco were taken
up in full. So was Grace Bros., and an
extra 17,500 were acquired as rights or
shares during the year. M. B. John,
Olympic, Rothmans had issues, but Lon-
don-Australia sold part of its entitle-
ments. Brownbuilt’s two-for-five issue at
200 p.c. premium was too steep for
London-Australia, which held 78,000
50c shares in December, 1964, so about
two-thirds of the rights were sold and
18,000 shares also.
What did the management recommend
for British investors in their place? New
to the portfolio were Broken Hill South,
New Broken Hill, Chrysler prefs, South
Australian Brewing and three Potter
floats 10,000 Macquarie Broadcast-
ing, 20,000 Stegbar (window manufac-
turer and distributor) and 44,000 Vickers
Australia (heavy engineering). Acquisi-
tion of 38,933 Wynyard Holdings is a
fascinating move.
Existing holdings in BHP, Associated
Portland Cement Manufacturers, North
Broken Hill and ODE were added to
for significant expenditures, and smaller
purchases were made of Boral, Carlton
United Brewery’s Z shares, Rio Tinto-
Zinc. Wyper Bros., the Bundaberg hard-
ware merchant and manufacturer with
branches in Brisbane, Townsville, Glad-
stone and Mackay (which had a dramatic
lift in profit in 1964-65 and improved
earning rate on higher capital), won
more support from London-Australia.
London-Australia’s vision of the Aus-
tralian industrial scene for 1966 is that
basic materials and processing industries
will remain strong and that the fall in
consumer durables, motor vehicles and
housing should level out later in the
year.
is more in the Alcoa-Dowell-
Overseas Corporation link than
meets the eye particularly for Over-
seas Corporation Ltd.
Overseas Corporation recently secur-
ed its supplies of PVC, which it uses in
great quantity, by taking over Plastic
Coatings, one of the four main produ-
cers in Australia. It now appears to have
secured its lines of supply in aluminium,
of which it would be one of the largest
single end-users in Australia, by this
link with Alcoa. Pricing policies of the
raw materials could be significant in both
cases.
In addition, Overseas has some power-
ful associations in Britain, having ex-
changed shareholdings in Midland Alu-
minium Ltd, which entitle it to useful
technical information at the cost of an
11 per cent interest in Overseas.
The market has taken more notice of
the recent takeover of Dowell Australia
Ltd by Alcoa of Australia Pty than the
concurrent joint venture arrangement
between Alcoa and Overseas Corpora-
tion.
This joint approach means that Alcoa,
the producer of primary aluminium and
semi-fabricated aluminium products, has
chosen Overseas Corporation as its as-
sociate in the end-product section of the
industry, after shopping around for three
years or more. The move gives effective
vertical integration without getting in-
volved in heavy capital costs an im-
portant consideration at a time when
aluminium semi-fabricators have been
busy buying out their major distributors
to ensure their outlets.
The Alcoa-Overseas link follows the
industry trend set when Comalco jumped
into G. E. Crane Holdings in June, 1961,
to secure distribution channels and an
outlet for some of its aluminium pro-
ducts that did not compete with Crane’s.
Comalco was prepared to pay a 60 p.c.
premium for 20 p.c. of Crane’s capital,
while allowing Crane to take up a l 6
p.c. shareholding in Comalco at par.
(Crane lent Comalco $348,000 too.)
Overseas Corporation, by transferring
its aluminium business in the building
industry and its facilities for making
aluminium building products to Dowell,
for an equal share with Alcoa in Dowell,
is eliminating former competition and
tying itself to a powerful raw material!
supplier.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Woo’d But Not Yet Won
“Attractive” Fibre Containers
A fter a discussion of the “paper” com-
panies, it seems natural to have a
look at some of the listed public com-
panies which make use of their pro-
ducts. I have selected the makers of
cartons and other fibre containers and
propose to start with Fibre Containers
Limited. I have noted that, when I last
examined this company, the share price
was $2.00. I then thought that this price
was only reasonable if the purchaser
realised that it fully discounted the pos-
sibility that a “powerful overseas com-
pany” might make a bid for the shares
in the near future or that the growth
rates of the ’fifties would continue into
the ’sixties. Since that time the shares
have been marked down to $1.30
that is, by 35 p.c. so the market is
.evidently taking a much more pessi-
mistic view of these prospects than it
was eighteen months ago.
Fibre Containers was formed as a pro-
prietary company in January, 1947, by
a group of timber box manufacturers.
Production commenced in February,
1948, and in April, 1955, the public
company was incorporated. Activities
were extended to Victoria in 1956-57
with the acquisition of Nettl Paper Con-
verters Limited, whose name was sub-
sequently changed to Hercules Fibre
Containers Pty Ltd, “Hercules” being
the brand name of Fibre Containers.
In 1961, Fibre Containers acquired
Johnell Ltd, whose assets then consisted
of a container manufacturing business
and about s2i million in cash, invest-
ments and advances. However, the con-
sideration for Johnell seems to have been
about $2,280,000 in cash plus another
$1,154,000 in preference shares and un-
secured notes which were close to cash
because they were redeemed within
twelve months.
After this acquisition, Bowater’s made
a bid which was accepted by Fibre Con-
tainers’ board, but this was capped by
a bid from Reed Paper Products which
Fibre Containers rejected! The result of
these events was a one-for-one bonus
issue to the Fibre Containers sharehold-
ers and no takeover by either overseas
group. Earnings per share have been de-
clining ever since (except for a rally in
1962-63), but dividends per share have
increased steadily so that they are now
70 p.c. greater than they were in 1960-
61! The differing patterns of market
value growth, earnings per share growth
and dividends per share growth are illus-
trated in the following tables of indices:
1956 = 100
Year to June 30 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960
Market price 100 106 144 197 252
Earnings 100 125 139 190 194
Dividends 100 100 100 123 123
1961 = 100
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Market price 100 129 146 153 95
Earnings 100 95 108 83 78
Dividends 100 142 159 170 170
In the face of these figures, it is re-
markable that the share price held for
so long and one can only conclude that
until recently the market still expected
a takeover offer at an extravagant price.
On the other hand, the rapidly rising
dividend rate could have been sufficient
reason, particularly if you belong to the
“yield” school.
Jf one compares pre-tax cash flow per
share with the earnings per share
series over the ten-year period, we find
that the picture of declining profitability
is confirmed.

B = Pre-tax cash flow per share.
Since 1961, Fibre Containers has sold
its Newport subsidiary to Carlton and
United Breweries and has therefore lost
the profits from this account. It also
seems that there was some delay in the
additions to and modernisation of the
Box Hill plant to take on production pre-
viously carried on at Newport which was
not on the account of Carlton and Uni-
ted. Also, in July, 1963. Fibre Contain-
ers (Tas.) Pty Ltd commenced the pro-
duction of shipping containers for the
Tasmanian apple crop and it would
appear that up to June 30, 1965, this
subsidiary had not reached the break-
even point. The 1965 directors’ report
also states “Although the container indus-
try continues to enjoy a high growth
rate there is still over-capacity, resulting
in intense competition.”
I think that this growth is still appar-
ent when one makes adjustments to the,
last four years’ accounts to eliminate the
profits of the Newport subsidiary from
1961- 1962-63 and 1963-64, and the
losses of the Tasmanian subsidiary in
1962- 1963-64 and 1964-65. My
rough calculations suggest that the earn-
ings of the remaining companies in the
group progressed roughly as follows:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965
s'ooo 364 412 452 518
% present capital 17.5 19.8 21.7 24 9
Index 1962 := 100 100 H 3 124 142
fpHE fibre container industry has
been in turmoil for the last five
years—and promises to be so for the
next five as the takeovers (complete,
partial or unsuccessful) of recent
times seem likely to be only the base
on which the industry will eventually
sort itself out.
The next big moves look like com-
ing from companies with overseas as-
sociations. British Tobacco has taken
Dodge and still seems to be shopping;
'Reed Paper is unashamedly looking
around; ACI has made a significant
link with St Regis that should lead to
greater activity here; Unilever has
moved heavily into the carton busi-
ness. And watching every move with
understandable self-interest is the in-
dustry’s only major supplier of raw
material, A PM.
Against this background “Security”
is examining the leading companies in
this industry over the next few weeks.
In the last article of this series, he will
compare them all and The
Bulletin’s “Chartist” will say what
he thinks about the situation their
shares face in the market.
This rate of growth is not quite as
good as the four years ended on June 30,
1961, but is not far short of it.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to
calculate the pre-tax cash flow on this
same basis; this would be desirable be-
cause the method of calculating the
depreciation provision was changed as
from the beginning of the 1964-65 year,
resulting in a drop of some 24 p.c. in the
provision. Furthermore, the company has
received quite considerable tax benefits
from the investment allowances and pre-
acquisition losses.
Taking these factors into account, I
think that one can assume that the earn-
ings yield on the price of $1.30 is 7.2
p.c. and the dividend yield is, of course,
5.8 .p.c. At this price and below the
shares are much more attractive than
they have been for many years.

MAN ON THE LAND
A Threat from Private Buying?
Behind the Woolcombers’ move
ACCORDING to Disraeli there is no wisdom like frankness. Frankness is sorely
missing from the wool industry at the present time. ,
The threat, or implied threat, of
Woolcombers Ltd, of Bradford, setting
up private buying operations in Aus-
tralia can only be considered in the light
of Britain’s current position in textiles
and her likely position in the light of
current trends. Woolcombers Ltd’s
managing director, Mr J. Alan Thomp-
son, is popular both with the Wool Board
and those woolgrowers who backed the
unsuccessful reserve price scheme,
Woolcombers was concerned by the
rejection of the reserve price scheme,
said Mr Thompson on his arrival in
Sydney. The possibility of establishing
“an associatjon which would prove of
mutual benefit to the woolgrower and
other sections of the industry” would
be examined. His firm wanted to buy at
stabilised prices because man-made fibres
were gaining strength “only because all
branches of the synthetics industry were
able to budget on prices.” His company
was the largest processor of wool in the
world and the biggest consumer in the
UK, Mr Thompson added.
The frank answer we would like from
Mr Thompson is whether he thinks his
firm will continue in that happy position
and whether the UK industry generally
will remain the largest manufacturer of
wool next to Russia. The 1964 figures
(according to the Wool Board statistical
service, which is very good even though
its spokesmen sometimes use the figures
to suit thei/ own arguments) were —•
Russia, 505 million lbs clean; UK, 418;
United States, 328; Japan, 310; France,
248; Italy, 185.
Sir William Gunn, at the AWIC con-
ference in Sydney, referred to the Wool-
combers’ move, or projected move, in
terms suggesting that woolgrowers had
been misguided in rejecting the reserve
plan backed so strongly by himself and
his board (and Mr Thompson). From
Sir William, or Mr W. J. Vines (managing
director, International Wool Secretariat),
the frank answer required would be the
extent to which Woolcombers Ltd or its
affiliates has been a beneficiary of IWS
promotion efforts compared with corres-
ponding Japanese and American firms.
It would also be interesting to know
whether Woolcombers is, in fact, the
largest individual buyer of Australian
wool or whether that distinction belongs
to the Japanese Itoh company.
We can readily ascertain the wider
general implications of Japanese ascen-
dancy over the UK as the major buyer
of Australian wool which is what
concerns Australian woolgrowers, and
non-woolgrowers, most. From the foun-
dation of the sheep industry until 1958
the UK was the major buyer. But from
1958 onwards the trend has been re-
markably towards Japan. The UK seems
to have slipped to a position where she
may soon be passed by the United States.
We know the US industry’s view of
the reserve plan irrevocably against.
We have never been told, in detailed
form, the Japanese view. In the interests
of frankness, and wisdom, the full text
of the Japanese letter to the Wool Board
shortly before the referendum should
now be revealed.
It is difficult, on all available informa-
tion, to get away from the ; dea that the
Japanese and US textile industries hold
the key to the future of the Australian
wool industry. Both the US industry
belatedly are in the forefront of auto-
mated electronic processes which' are
said to be relatively unsophisticated
compared with what is envisaged in a

few years time. It is even claimed that
woolclassing itself may be rendered
obsolete.
Be that as it may, the uncomfortable
fact seems to be that the United King-
dom, in wool as in so many other things,
is sadly lacking. This is uncomfortable
only because a good many Australians
are incapable of feeling anything but
affection for Britain and her slide down
the scale provokes both disappointment
and bewilderment.
Woolgrowers, therefore, must ask
themselves whether the Woolcombers’
proposals are dictated by concern for
the Australian wool growing industry or
concern for the UK wool processing in-
dustry. If we were Mr Thompson, we, too,
would be concerned. Mr Wilson and his
planners not only have plans to scuttle
the Royal Navy but also have one aimed
at heavy Government subsidy for the
home-based UK synthetics industry—to
reduce dependence on imports.
Mr Thompson repeats the assertion
that the reserve price plan would have
removed the bugbear of manufacturing
(as he sees it) by reducing fluctuations.
As this one dies hard we dig out, from
the dusty files, the statement by New
Zealand Wool Board chairman, Mr J.
Acland, following the referendum result
and which, funnily enough, got only
passing mention in Australia.
IV/Tr Acland said that the NZ Board
would have welcomed a reserve price
plan in Australia and then added that
he had gone to Australia “to explain the
NZ floor price scheme and not as an
advocate.” He said: “We, too, are con-
cerned about large price fluctuations. We
are investigating the present system with
an open mind and with all the special
assistance we can command. We shall
see what we can do to remedy its (the
NZ plan) imperfections while retaining
its advantages. We shall also look
with some care at alternative selling
systems.
“The New Zealand scheme was de-
signed to protect the woolgrower against
the effects of a serious fall in prices. It
was not primarily designed to stabilise
prices, but it did give confidence to the
trade and so had a steadying effect.
Although the scheme proposed to the
Australian growers was very like our
own it was attacked and defended largely
on its effectiveness as a stabilising force.
It was for this and other reasons that it
has been rejected.”
That, we think, is being exceedingly
frank. Obviously the New Zealand plan
is not going to be ditched, neither is it
regarded as the panacea which the Wool
Board claimed the Australian scheme
to be.
Considering the close affinity between
Sir William Gunn and Mr Thompson
during the reserve price campaign, it
is difficult to accept a situation in which,
suddenly, Mr Thompson’s activities pose
a threat. If wool growers are stampeded
into having second thoughts on the way
they voted in the referendum, then one
would imagine both Sir William and Mr
Thompson would be pleased.
It is now too much to expect that the
vote was final. The reserve price group
is obviously going to go on and on and
on. Like protection versus free trade,
this is a debate in which the argu-
ments and the sides are ill-defined. There
would appear to be more than two
sides, yet the individual woolgrower is
given the choice of only one or the
other. How it will end, we feel, is some-
thing beyond the ability of any one man,
or men, to decide.
The one (hing , hat can be
favor of the present situation is that the
refusal to let the matter rest may give
woolgrowers a better insight into real
aims and objectives.


P.A. MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS PTY. LTD.
P.A. Appointments Division has been asked
to advise on the following appointment
GENERAL MANAGER
$12,000
A large overseas company, which is about to establish an Australian
subsidiary, is seeking a General Manager to control and develop
these operations. This man would, on appointment, be required to
spend with his family upwards to one year in England whilst he
became familiar with the company’s products and its trading rami-
fications. The company’s activities involve the development of
import-export business particularly in the area of ferrous and non-
ferrous metals and chemicals. However it is also active in a wide
range of commodities. Initially the General Manager will be required
to operate without staff or at the most with a very small staff.
QUALIFICATIONS: Professional qualifications of some kind may be
an advantage because this man must possess a trained, disciplined
mind. Qualifications in Chemical Engineering, Metallurgy or related
disciplines would be of value to him but by ho means essential. He
must have very broad commercial experience and a sound know-
ledge of Australian industry. His experience must have developed
in him the capacity to recognise and exploit marketing opportunities.
Knowledge of import-export trading could be a decided advantage
but the quality of the man and his general commercial experience
could be more important. Obviously he must be of general
management calibre.
AGE: 30 to 40 years preferred.
SALARY: These negotiations will be quite flexible. Up to $12,000
can be taken as a guide only., A car is provided and there is
generous superannuation.
SECURITY: Candidates are assured of the strictest confidence. No
information will be passed to the client and no inquiries will be
made until permission is given at a personal interview. Applications,
stating age, qualifications, experience, appointments held and
quoting Reference Number 1820/B should be addressed to:

An Import Ban Lifted
Developing natural insecticides
HThe Commonwealth quarantine authorities have now agreed
A to allow Bacillus thuringiensis, a biological control agent,
to be imported. They had feared that it might cause the in-
advertent destruction of certain useful insects, notably Cac-
toblastis, the moth responsible for controlling prickly pear. It
had been shown in laboratory studies overseas that this moth
is very susceptible to B. thuringiensis. However, it is now surely
known that at least one strain of this bacillus is already present
in Australia. Apparently, the organism is unable to trouble
field populations of Cactoblastis under our conditions. Check
tests have supported this view.
Mr H. Schurr, of the Victorian Department of Agriculture,
found a colony of diseased Indian Meal Moths some months
ago in a warehouse near Mildura. The disease-causing organism
has since been positively identified as a new strain of B.
thuringiensis by an American authority, A. M. Heimpel, from
specimens sent to him by the CSIRO Division of Entomology.
Heimpel, who has been closely associated for many years with
the use of this and other bacteria as microbial insecticides has
written that,'“They are superb control agents. Bacillus thurin-
giensis has failed infrequently and only when misused.” New
Zealand already permits the importation of this bacterium.
The new freedom to import will undoubtedly stimulate new
lines of research and a new approach to insect control in this
country. Probably the application of bacteria, as well as viruses
and fungi, as natural insecticides will be the next major use of
biological weapons against Australian pests. If several of the
more serious insect pests can be subjugated by one or other of
these agents the value to our agriculture could approach that
accruing from the last spectacular use of a biological control,
namely myxomatosis. Though accurate figures are difficult to
obtain, the total loss caused by all insect pests in this country
may easily exceed $250 million a year.
The possible new control techniques may come quickly here
since there is much helpful American experience to guide our
entomologists. For instance, the Americans have listed more
than a hundred destructive moths and butterflies, mostly be-
longing to the Lepidoptera family, that are especially sensitive
to B. thuringiensis. But they have shown that bees and other
beneficial insects are not subject to it. Moreover, methods of
growing the bacteria on a commercial scale have been develop-
ed and the difficult problem of putting them into preparations
suitable for dusting or spraying on plants has been solved. The
cost of production, incidentally, is fully competitive with that
of many chemical insecticides. No evidence has yet come to
hand to suggest that the currently susceptible species of insects
will eventually develop resistance.
This microbial insecticide must be eaten by the insects and
so thorough coverage of plant foliage is essential. The insects
die within two or three days of swallowing the bacteria, but
they stop feeding within a few hours because the gut soon be-
comes paralysed. The harmlessness of the bacterium to humans
has been recognised by the US Food and Drug Administration
an extremely cautious department which does not de-
mand that vegetables, fruit, etc., be free of residues as it does
for most of the other insecticides in common use. This bac-
terial insecticide has also been proved harmless .to all other
animals including fish and birds.
The Americans have also had considerable practical success
with another bacterial insecticide based on B. popilliae. Two
closely related bacilli are known to occur in Australia and there
is some evidence that they are helping to suppress the numbers
of pasture cockchafers.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Come You Not from Newcastle
With a temptation to short
T TNTIL a month ago, I’d never heard of Newcastle disease. As there had never been
an outbreak of the disease in Australia before this year, a confession of ignorance
does not shame me.
I have subsequently learnt that it is
a disease which stunts the growth of
poultry, and this is one of the few re-
maining countries which has never ex-
perienced a major outbreak. I discov-
ered also that the name originates from
the Newcastle district in England. With
this mass of knowledge behind me, I
have keenly followed newspaper reports
as to the area of the latest outbreak.
First there was Queensland; next certain
parts of NSW, and now Victoria and the
Northern Territory. The paradox of the
whole situation is that our own New-
castle (stamping ground of Steggles) is
one of the few areas which is free from
the disease so far.
Despite what one paper said about
Steggles when the outbreaks first oc-
curred in Queensland, it had occurred to
me that Steggles rights at 90c. were a
good shorting proposition. However,
influenced by the masters of the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange, I decided
against taking this action, only to see
the rights fall to 70c.
Perhaps this fall was only a reflec-
tion of the general market collapse. The
collapse had dragged such excellent com-
panies as Comeng and Kolotex down 15
p.c. in price. Rather than just gloat
on the fact that I had sold these shares
at close to peak prices, I decided to re-
enter one of them, Comeng, at $l.ll.
Apart from still being cum the 7i p.c.
interim dividend, the shares show a divi-
dend yield of just under 7 p.c.
Breaking new ground for the Diary
was the purchase of 500 Anderson Seeds
rights at 20c. .This company is just in
the process of making a l-for-3 issue at
a 10c. premium. After the issue, total
capital will be $1 million —just five times
greater than it was in 1961.
Although over a hundred years old,
it is only in the last five years that
Anderson has awakened to the potential
in its field. Most important has been the
move into sub-tropical and tropical seeds
through the takeover of Duranbah Pas-
toral Company Pty Ltd. Anderson’s
now has some 13 seed production prop-
erties spread between Coffs Harbor up
through Queensland to New Guinea. At
the same time the company has not
neglected its traditional activities of
garden seeds, bulbs and allied lines.
Even more extraordinary than the rate
of increase in capital has been the ability
of profits to match this growth. As for
the future, directors feel so confident
that a 9 p.c. dividend is to be paid this
year (the highest rate in many years).
The last purchase of the week was
1000 Westralian at 35c. As a result, I
now have two beach sands companies in
the portfolio. The Diary had held a
position in the stock several months ago,
but these were sold upon the announce-
ment of the 1965 profits. This profit of
$lBO,OOO was less than had been antici-
pated by the company and, frankly, I was
disappointed.
As it turned out, I should have waited
for the chairman’s address. First of all,
it was pointed out that a loss had been
incurred on zircon sales in the first six
months of the 1964-65 year. Since then,
the outlook for zircon has improved so
much that zircon production has been
increased by 50 p.c. In addition, 1965-
66 profits should be boosted by $25,000,
this being the maiden dividend expected
from Western Minerals Sands Pty Ltd.
So here am I back in the stock six cents
above the price at which I sold out.
The only share sold this week was
L. J. Hooker. Mr. Campbell frightened
me out of the stock with his assessment
of the immediate future.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
1000 L. J. Hooker, 30c $294
BOUGHT
500 Anderson Seeds rts, 20c .... $lO3
500 Comeng, $l.ll $568
1000 Westralian, 35c $359
Still a healthy credit balance of $999
remaining.
