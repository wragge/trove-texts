Percy and Archibald Want Our
Fleet
The Red Page
There still remain in England certain people
who wish to put us in our proper place. At
least, there are two journalistic persons,
Percy Hurd and Archibald Hurd, who, in
The Note Empire Partnership (Murray, per
Sydney Book Club), are engaged in attempt-
ing to put back the clock of the Empire.
These two journalistic persons have seized
the opportunity of the war to rope Aus-
tralia into a partnership that she does not
require and won’t have. Naturally, it is to
be a junior partnership, and inevitably
Percy and Archibald want our fleet. The
qualifications of these two journalistic per-
sons for speaking for the Empire can be
judged by their conception of the Dominions.
“Fifty years ago the majority of people
believed that on the first opportunity the
Colonies would cut the painter 1. . . Succes-
sive British Governments conceded to the
Dominions so much rope that at last these
kith and kin oversea became suspicious of
some sinister intention and sat down to con-
sider if. after all, it would profit them to
cast adrift from the Mother-country, with
her great and growing demand for their pro-
duce, with her immense wealth, enabling
them to raise money on cheaper terms than
in any other country, and with her defensive
armaments, particularly the Fleet.’ So it
was all a mere sordid bargain on our part!
Percy and Archibald want our fleet. Their
argument is that allies. cannot co-operate
effectively at sea. because allies provide their
own distinctive navies, and those forces tend
inevitably to differentiation in their stra-
tegical and tactical ideas. Well, why not?
Haven’t the Australians proved themselves
capable of differentiating themselves as sol-
diers from the British soldier, and what
would have happened at Suvla if we hadn’t?
As for our navy, the Australia is the one
teetotal ship in the Grand Fleet, and is that
differentiation anything to ue ashamed of?
It is amazing at the present moment for
these two journalistic persons to suggest
that Australia is not doing her share in the
war. “The British peo'ple are still bearing
the burden of Empire with little or no assist-
ance, paying alike for the British Navy, the
British Army, the British diplomatic service,
the British consular service and the Crown
itself. These are factors which it is an im-
pertinence to the Dominions to rule out of
the discussion.” No: ’the impertinence is on
the part of Percy and Archibald. They even
admit that the Motherland has never men-
tioned the matter. But. luckily. Percy and
Archibald can be depended on to do so.
J*
And a further impertinence is the state-
ment that Maoriland, in neglecting to pro-
vide a,navy, and handing over the New Zea-
land to the Admiralty, “had set up a stan-
dard of patriotism reached by no other
daughter land” —Maoriland, who has con-
fessed that her safety depended solely upon
the presence of the unpatriotic Common-
wealth’s dreadnought! Australia did her
share by providing the fleet-unit suggested:
the British Admiralty—for good ' reasons —
failed to fulfil its agreement to contribute
a Pacific unit of equal strength. As for
our unit, these two journalistic persons can
still assert that “it could be of no appreci-
able war value for many years.!’ Was the
safety from destruction of the coastal cities
o: Maoriland and Australia, or the extrac-
tion of a heavy ransom, and the termination
of the existence of Hun settlements in the
Pacific of no war value? Percy and Archi-
bald ought really to read the papers. Yet
they state that the German colonial empire
was divorced from the Motherland and
smothered in detail “in virtue of the
strength and vitality of British sea-power.”
Yes, but that part of British sea-power was
provided by our baby fleet. And note how
nicely these two journalistic persons whittle
down our glorious share by this character-
istic sneer: —
“Apart from assisting in the convoy of
Dominion troops, and securing the safety
of various small expeditions in the Pacific,
the local navies as such have made no con-
tribution to the issue of the war. Even the
success of the Australian cruiser Sydney,
. which destroyed the Emden, supports this
contention. The Sydney was one of several
British and Japanese ships on her way to
European waters- —already beyond her local
station —when, under the orders of the
senior officer of the convoy of man-of-war,
she had the opportunity of rendering con-
spicuous service. The Sydney—British
built and manned mainly by British officers
and skilled ratings—was selected for the
task, presumably because of her relatively
high speed and her modern armament, which
gave her the advantage over the German
vessel.” We never did anything! Yet
Percy and Archibald admit that the Pyra-
mus and rhilomel. two old and inferior
British warships, left the convoy to take
their place in the cordon which was being
drawn round the Emden. And an officer
on the Philomel states that he knew that if
these two ships did engage the Emden. “being
faster than either of us, she could have?
drawn out of the fight whenever she hacf
liked.” Yet this British officer has the nei-ve
to add—and Percy and Archibald the cheek
to quote—“ Had not the Sydney caught the
Emden, something else would have done so,
as the net was being drawn very close.” It
was lucky that the two British ships did not
catch the Emden, even if they had possessed
the speed to do it. The Sydney had the
speed : the British ships hadn’t. The Syd-
ney was provided by the Commonwealth and
was just where the Commonwealth wanted
her. It is deeply to be regretted that these
two journalistic persons should have been
allowed to give publicity to this expression
of opinion on the part of a British officer;
and it is to be wondered at that Percy and
Archibald had not better taste at this time
than to raise such a question.
J*
Apparently these two offensive journalists
know so little of naval strategy, and con-
sider that we know so little, that they
imagine that Australia wants to keep her
fleet within the three-mile limit of her
coasts. He thinks that Australians are such
degenerate descendants of the sea-rovers of
England that it would convey to them a
“sense of importance” to watch with pride
their vessels “cruising off their coasts.” And
he speaks of our “little ships,” evidently
forgetting the Australia. Finally, the two
journalistic persons who want our fleet know
so little about Australia that they think the
continent is inhabited by “Australian bush-
rangers” !
One wonders whether Percy and Archi-
bald, had they been peaceably bushranging
in Australia in the anxious opening days of
the war, and knew that the safety of Aus-
tralia depended on the Pyramus and the
Philomel, would not have changed their
views about the utter uselessness of baby
fleets? Von Spee could have informed them.
Stephen Leacock’s Humor
Moonbeams from the Larger Lunacy, the
latest book by Stephen Leacock (Lane, per
W. Dymock, Sydney), hardly fulfils the ex-
travagant promise of its title. But it is a
worthy successor of Literary Lapses and
Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich.
His “Spooff: a thousand-guinea novel” is a
delectable burlesque. And his “afternoon ad-
ventures” at his club are full of rich humor
and an irony very sure. There is Mr.
Doomer, with his serious thoughts about
death. Everybody ought to realise that some
day he will die. “ ‘Every man ought to feel
that at any moment he may be called upon
to meet his’ —Mr. Doomer paused here as
if seeking a phrase—‘liis Financial Obliga-
tions, face to face. At any time, sir, he may
be hurried before the Judge—or, rather, his
estate may—of the Probate Court. It is a
solemn thought, sir.. . .Any man if he thinks
death is near may at least divest himself of
his purely speculative securities and trust
himself entirely to those gold-bearing bonds
of the great industrial corporations whose
value will not readily diminish or pass
away.’ ” And when Doomer dies his doctor
reports that it was one of the most edify-
ing bedsides that he had ever attended. When
the doctor had warned him that he could do
nothing further, and that it was time for
other ministrations tham his, Doomer said
faintly but firmly, “Send for my broker.”
his last requests was: “Read me from
the text of the State Inheritance Tax
Statute.” Doomer listened with his eyes
closed. “The reading seemed to bring him
great comfort. When it was ended he said
with a sigh, ‘That covers it. I’ll put my
faith in that.’ After that he was silent for
a moment, and then said: ‘I wish I had
already crossed the river. Oh, to have
already crossed the river, and be safe on the
other side.’ We knew what he meant. He
had always planned to move over to New
Jersey. The inheritance tax is so much more
liberal.”
And there is a pleasant irony in Leacock’s
description of “The Last Man Out of
Europe.” When the author met Parkins and
heard him mention “the war zone” he knew
what the trouble was. “He was the last man
out of Europe, that is to say, the latest last
man. There had been about 14 others in the
club that same afternoon. In fact, they
were sitting all over it in Italian suits and
Viennese overcoats, striking German matches
on the soles of Dutch boots. These were the
‘war zone’ men, and they had just got out ‘in
the clothes they stood up in.’ Naturally they
hated to change.” A more familiar type to us
is the amateur Joffre. There were two of
these in the author’s club. “There was some-
thing awful in the grimness of the struggle
as carried on by Jinks and Blinks. If Blinks
thought to terrify. Jinks by threatening to
burn London, he little knew his man. “All
right,” said Jinks, taking a fresh light for
his cigar, ‘burn it! By doing so, you destroy,
let us say, two million of my women and
children. Very good, Am I injured by that?
No. You merely stimulate me to recruiting.’ ”
And delightful is this professor’s rendering
of the poem of “Lord Ullin’s Daughter” as
a problem in trigonometry. The hardy High-
land wight, happily, knew algebra, and when
asked to row Lord Ullin o’er the ferry,
replied:—
Suppose the river X -f- Y,
And call the distance 0,
Then dare we thus the gods defy?
I think we dare, don’t you?
Our floating power expressed in words
Is X + 4 f
And, in order to increase the interest in
technical books, the professor suggests that
their frequently sensational facts should be
set forth with newspaper headlines. Euclid,
for instance, writes in small type such an
item as this; “A perpendicular is let fall on
the line BC so as to bisect it at the point
C, etc.,” just as if it were the most ordinary
occurrence in the world. Every newspaper
man will see that it ought to be set up like
this:—
AWFUL CATASTROPHE.
PERPENDICULAR PALLS HEADLONG ON A GIVEN POINT.
Line at 0 said to be completely bisected.
President of the Line makes Statement.
Leacock’s selection of truthful speeches, in
which oratprs declare their real thoughts,
should be <sf inestimable value to all Gover-
nors, Premiers and Lord Mayors. And his
interview with Bernliardi» in which that
Hun confesses that his great book is an
example of Hun humor, is almost the great-
est thing Canada has done in the war. One
can sympathise with Bemhardi’s indignation
at Jellicoe. One passage, he explains was
specially designed to frighten Admiral Jelli-
coe. “And he won’t read it! Potstauscnd,
he won’t read it! What sort of combatants
are these of the British navy who refuse to
read our war-books? The Kaiser’s Heligo-
land speech—they never read a word of it.
The Furchtbarkeit-Proklamation of August—
they never looked at it. The lieichstags-Jtcde
with the printed picture of the Kaiser shak-
ing hands with everybody—they used it to
wrap up sandwiches ! They sit there in their
ships, Jellicoe and his men, and they read
nothing! How can we get at them if they
refuse to read? How can we frighten them
away if they haven’t culture enough to get
frightened?”
But the best thing in this remarkable
hotch-potch of humor is a serious allegory of
the first newspaper, a brilliant reconstruction
of an historical moment, the printing of the
first newspaper in the world. It has a
present-day application to all journalists.
Australasian
Captain W. Manning’s stories first
appeared in various M.L. papers. Interned
(Whitcombe and Tombs, M.L., Is. 3d.) con-
tains six stories of the sea and the sailor.
The author evidently knows more about sail-
ing craft than about the literary craft. The
stories are quite good enough if the author
would only follow his own advice and “let
the story tell itself.” He needs a stern sub-
editor to knock out his superfluous digres-
sions and his numerous cliches. In one
yarn he takes the trouble to inform his
reader that “The Strand is one of London’s
most interesting thoroughfares,” and that
“Fleet-street is distinctly journalistic and
literary.” Maybe, they do not know these
things in M.L. And how horrible sound his
cliches! In one sentence the author manages
to include, “an authority on things Thes-
pian,” “laid to his soul the flattering unc-
tion,” “the most recherche items of the
dramatic fare.” And on the next page,
“they regaled themselves to the best, re-
gardless of expense.” A pity, since Captain
Manning has sometimes a tale to tell.
There is a sort of humor that is becom-
ing stereotyped as the Wayback Australian
brand. It appears in the well-known “Way-
back” series of stories, and in the hotch-
potch of those stories that masquerades as
a play of that title. It is really a caricature
of a caricature: it is real Australian humor
deliberately made, or attempted to be made,
funnier by the grossest exaggeration until the
original Australian is quite lost in the false
caricature. Sumner Locke does not offend
as seriously as the originator of that
machine-made humor ; but it is not for want of
trying. Her Mum Dawson, Boss, contained
some real Australian humor; in her* latest
story, Skeeter Farm ( N.S.W. Bookstall Co.
Sydney), the thin vein of Australian humor
peters out into a mass of merely verbal
extravagances. But for those who find the
real Australian humor in The Way backs
they will manage to find it in Skeeter Farm.

All that this page can say about A Graphical
Solution of One Case of Spherical Triangles,
Also a A ew Method of Solving Some Spheri-
cal Triangles by Plane Trigonometry, by C.
W. Adams (Ferguson and Osborn, Welling-
ton, M.L.) is that the solution looks graphi-
cal and the triangles spherical. But between
diagrams the author has managed to intro-
duce a personal note. “The germ of the idea
occurred to me over six years ago, when I
was investigating the ingenious method em-
ployed by the late Charles Hope Harris for
deriving latitude from azimuthal observa-
tions of two circumpolar stars. As 1 was
very busy at the time I made a small diagram
and put it by till a more convenient season.
But as the state of my health is getting very
precarious, I decided to publish my results
without further delay. So I wrote the fore-
going article, and thought I had said all
there was to say on the subject. But on Sep-
tember 8, 1915, between the hours of 3 and
4 a.m., as I lay in bed in the dark, thinking
over the problem, it suddenly occurred to
me that my diagram could be made available
for solving another case of spherical tri-
angles, and also for analysing, at a glance,
any ambiguous case in Spherical Trigono-
metry. I have therefore written the follow-
ing article, but still I have not said all there
is to say on this interesting investigation.”
The author, who has been for many years
the editor of the M.L. Surveyor, was for-
merly M.L. Government Astronomer and
Chief Surveyor, and mentions that he is en-
tirely self-taught.
How to Market Plays
“Every week,” writes an Earnest Austra-
lian Playwright, “I see paragraphs in Tiie
Bulletin deploring the scarcity of Austra-
lian plays, but giving no advice how an Aus-
tralian playwright may place his wares
the market.” And he wants to know— 11
(1) How is a play copyrighted («) in
Australia, (6) in England? u

Tradesmarks and Copyright office in the caffiui .
your State. That in Sydney is in the Federal e° f
toms Office, Circular Quay. The clerk will tell ,
how to do the rest. It will cost you ss. 611 you
(2) The name of a press-agent in London
who handles plays.
A number of literary agents in London handle
dramatic work as well as literarv—many
ently, as a side-line. A list is to be found’ in Th=
LitKrary Year Book. The following agents—a,
important point— have offices in New York as well
as in London: The Authors’ Alliance, 2 Clement*.
Inn, London, W.C. ; Massie and Co., 40 Fleet-street
London, E.C. ; and Curtis BrOwn, 6 Henrietta-street’ 1
Covent Garden, London, W.C. It was this last firm
that sold Mrs. Pretty and the Premier to Bourchier
(3) What are the terms .offered by thea-
trical managers to playwrights— (a) a lump
sum, (b) royalties?
There is no record’of Australian managers avail-
able. In the case of three recent Australian plays"
On Our Selection, Seven Little Australians, and The
Waybacks, the authors of th& books upon which
these plays were founded had very little to do with
the actual dramatisation. It was the copyright of
the books and the advertisement of their titles that
the Australian managers practically bought. The
terms depend on the play and upon the manager
The author gets the best terms he can ; but no author
of a play should be fool enough to accept a lump
sum. The contract between the author of Mrs.
Pretty and the Premier and Arthur Bourchier may be
quoted as an example of generous dealing by a
London manager with an unknown Australian play-
wright, helped, of course, by a shrewd dramatic
agent.
The author leases to the manager the sole right
of production in the Empire (except Canada) for
five years from date of first performance. The mana-
ger shall pay to the author £lOO in advance and on
account of royalties. The manager shall produce the
play before a certain date at a first-class theatre
and with a competent cast. Should he fail to do
so before that date he shall be allowed a further six
months in which to produce the play by a further
payment of £lOO in advance and on account, of
royalties; but should he fail to produce the play
the manager forfeits the £2OO, and loses all his
rights in it.
The manager shall pay to the author royalties on
the gross receipts according to this scale: Up to
gross receipts of £BOO a week, 5 per cent.; on all
gross receipts in excess of £BOO up to £lOOO a
week, per cent. ; on all gross receipts in excess of-.
£lOOO a week, 10 per cent.; in provinces and
colonies, 5 per cent. ; when play is sub-let in the
provinces, 50 per cent, of all moneys received.
The manager must announce the name of the
author as sole author on all programmes, posters,
etc.; he must furnish to the author’s agent proper
statements of gross weekly receipts; he shall have
the option for one month after first production to
purchase professional rights in the United States and
Canada by payment of £lOO in advance and on
account of royalties. The manager cannot assign the
agreement without the author’s consent. The author
retains all lights except those leased. He retains all
film rights (nowadays, a most important point);
but he has to prevent all amateur performances of
the play. The author undertakes that no film of the
play shall be released during the five years’ lease.
Any offer the author gets for filming the play must
first be referred to the manager in order to allow
the manager and his company to play the leading
parts in the film.
(4) If a play is likely to become a money-
maker in Australia equal to On Our Selec-
tion, what is it worth?
Send it, by telegraph, if possible;- to Bert Bailey, i
He’ll tell you by urgent wire.
(5) Has a play to be submitted to the
Censor before or after copyrighting?
Goodness knows what the Censor’s rights are! Get
your play accepted first.

“Jean Sibi”: George Calderon, dramatist, publicist
and critic, has been officially reported “missing” at
the Dardanelles. He was only 47, and had led a highly-
diverting existence. A son of Philip H. Calderon,
R.A., he went through Rugby and Oxford and
obtained further respectable enlightenment as a
librarian in the British Museum. Always something
of a rebel, he blamed an outraged social conscience
for his heretical literary performances and odd propa-
gandist activities. It is not generally known that he
was a philosophic anti-feminist of the Bax type, and
played a big part in the Men’s League for Opposing
Women’s Suffrage in England. As a writer lie is
best remembered for his plays, but he has also been
guilty of a romance, Dwala, and a publication
entitled Woman in Relation to the State, which
reveals a rational, unsentimental attitude about the
importance of the female in the social scheme. Fur-
tlier, he did good work in translating some of the
plays of Tolstoi and Tchekov, and contributed to a
wayback Quarterly the best-informed article on the
Russian drama that the present writer has ever
read. Of his plays The Fountain, staged, in Mel-
bourne by Gregan McMahon, is his most conspicuous
achievement. A talky discussion on public chanty,
with a decrepit background of slum-dwellers, this
formless three-act piece pretends to stir up the dust
of a pulverised Shaw anent the traditional villainy of
landlords. In this business the motif gets somewhat
obscured, while Wren, the pungent specialist in
Calderon’s ideas, seems only a bit of aimless nerve-
force, disclosing in his knowledge of the theories of
Shaw, _ Galsworthy and similar passe reformers, an
extensive acquaintance with the classics. Thompson,
a play left incomplete by the late St. John Hankin
and finished off by Calderon, is hardly representative
of the latter’s style. It is a slight social comedy of
the Wilde pattern wherein two or three of the
characters are born witty, while the remainder have
wit thrust upon them. The story is banal and senti-
mental. One is not familiar with Geminae and
Revolt, produced by the Little and Miss Horniman s
Theatres in England, but one may say that The
Little Stone House, an ironical Russian playlet on
the subject of mother-love, contains some vivid
snapshots of Russian types. Calderon’s dramatic out-
put was too small to give him a front place among
intellectual writers for the stage, but it was suffici-
ently large to display an outlook and esprit all t°°
rare in the literature of our time. After the P u6l1 ‘
cation of The Fountain Calderon was hastily likened
to Shaw, but he always fiercely resisted the accusa-
tion. To my way of thinking, Calderon more re-
sembled Wilde in his occasional fantasies of expres-
sion and love of fine sayings. Certainly he was
rather proud of his observations, for when he na
anything acute and sparkling to remark, he hung »
on his play like an iron cross.

He wouldn’t give his liver a

It wasn’t his liver’s fault. It
was his fault for neglecting it.
Like your liver, it was trying
always to get the poisons of
gloom and vindictiveness out of
his blood, trying to make him
sunny and sweet - tempered,
kindly and considerate. The
wonderful, persevering, well-
intentioned chemistry of his
liver was just the same as
yours, but it never was helped
to do its work. Be warned!
Gentle help at the right time—-
gentle, not drastic —is all your

have proved that the gentlest,
friendliest, mcst appreciated
help you can give it is to take
now and then, before your

they knew they could
do so easily and also

Safety Razor
Every purchaser of a “7 o clock
Safety Razor set retail is entitled to
nominate a friend who has joined
the colours, and to this friend
a set of equal value will be sent
absolutely FREE of Charge.
Ask your dealer for full particulars.
This safety razor is by far the most convenient and satis-
factory for use in Field, Camp, Barracks, or on Shipboard.
It is self-contained, even to the strop, which is hinged in the
case itself and cannot be mislaid or lost. With a single
touch it springs open for stropping or cleaning, and with
another touch it snaps together into accurately adjusted
shaving position. (See sketches at top right-hand corner.)
Sergeant L. J. Vl CCA MS, Ist D. C.L.1., writes :
“ Up to the time of first using a “7 o’clock ”
Safety Razor out here shaving was a task
to be avoided. Now it is a delight."

Roses.
It was never a rose that you sent to me
But a goblet of desire,
Nothing so cool as a petal’s fold
But a crimson cup filled with wine of gold
And of fragrance and of fire.
It was never a rose that you sent to me
On its green spear thorned and brave,
With a dewy cloak of the garden’s grace
And a tale of winds in a sheltered place;
But it was your heart you gave.
I fingered the thorns on that princely stem,
I studied its scents and glows,
I prised the cling of each leaf apart —
And found it was neither cup nor heart,
And nothing at all but a rose!

Retribution.
She loved me for the dangers I had passed
(For ev’ry tale I told her was a gem
Of youthful lawlessness ; and I was classed,
By her, an outlaw hard to be surpassed),
And I loved her that she did pity them.
’Twas sweet to be believed ; and she believed.
I saw her stooping like a bending saint
To heal the sinner, pitiful and grieved.
And so I married her> whom I deceived
With pictures painted with vermilion paint.
For all our sins an even Justice waits
To mete out punishment to those who flout
The laws prescribede’en oft to our true
mates
It gives the whip of punishment. My fate’s
To suffer for the sins I talked about.
Therefore, I must endure the jealous throb
About some far-off name that I forget;
And I must daily soothe the tearful sob,
Swearing I never really loved some snob
Of my invention —girls none ever met!
My fate pursues me, knowing naught of
ruth ;
With jealous prickings all my spirit bleeds.
I dare not make confession of the truth.
I wish I had been wicked in my youth,
For then I’d not have boasted of my deeds !

The Enchanted Lagoon.
When we faced the dim lagoon
All the air was cool and damp;
At our feet a crimson moon
Glimmered oddly like a lamp.
And another, dread to see,
Poised above the still lagoon,
Caught upon a barren tree
Like a swollen red balloon.
“Come, my love, my love!” I said,
“There is blood upon the skies;
Look! the waters, too, are red ;
And a fire is in your eyes !
But my love, jny lady, turned
Toward me in that sullen spot.
Red and red the large moon burned !
Red my lady’s lips and hot!
Now a strange new planet came,
Swimming from the reedy edge;
At our feet it lay aflame,
Shining white amid the sedge.
“Come my love, my love,” I cried,
And the mist was on my breath ;
“ ’Tis a dead man naked-eyed,
All its whiteness is of Death.”
But my lady stayed my haste.
“ ’Tis the gleaming of my breast,
’Tis the whiteness of my waist;
We will stay and we will rest.”
Upward from that shadowed close
Climbed the moon across the night!
Changed from crimson, changed to rose,
Changed from rose to pearly white.
And we marked the waning fire !
Soared the planet high above !
All the flame of red Desire
Faded, faded, into Love !

Wollongong.
The waves break white by Wollongong,
Swept from a sapphire sea ;
While in the background Keira stands
In purple majesty.
And, on the far horizon’s verge,
Beneath an azure sky,
Splashed by the sun with pallid gold,
The lone Five Islands lie.
Grim mountain, guardian of her gates,
Bluff cliffs all dashed with spray;
And, in the cup between, the town,
A sleepy Quaker grey.
Long lines of antiquated streets,
Trim gardens gay with flowers;
While, here and there, a red-tiled roof
Burns through the sunlit hours.
Soft southern nights has Wollongong
When one great lighthouse star
Signals its message o’er the deep
To some dark ship afar.
Upon the whole place seems to rest
The peace of old-world times ;
Yet through the darkness Keira broods,
Quick with her living mines.
An ancient virgin Wollongong,
Wrapt in her life apart,
An ancient virgin with a pulse
Stirring her dreaming heart.

THE GAY TIME THE AUSTRALIAN
KID IS GOING TO HAVE.
“The brilliant future before Australia” —
the words are dripping from the lips of poli-
ticians almost daily in every State in the
Commonwealth. The newspapers find the
phrase convenient and comforting. The
average man has a profound faith, when he
hears or reads the sentence, that immedi-
ately the Big Fight is over he is going to
sit down and bask in the radiance of what
he calls prosperity; that the nation is going
to realise all the finer ideals of democracy
in a great hurry and —this faith is a queer
mixture of idealism and cash —acquire great
affluence and dignity all at once. It was
put this way a day or two ago:—
Australia’s opportunities after the war will be
limitless. European industry has in many directions
been almost ruined. This country will find her pro-
ducts in greater demand abroad than at any time
before, and the local manufacturer a wider market in
Australia for his goods. Metals, meat, dairy produce
and wool will be asked for from us in increasing
quantity by people who must have them, and will be
prepared to pay handsomely for supplies tc start their
industries going and maintain the industrial popula-
tion.
Y. t for all the meaning there is in this it
might just as well have been written: —
Australia’s opportunities before the war were limit-
less. When it is over, they will be the same. This
country will find, etc., etc
And even that would have missed the bull’s
eye by yards, for what “this country is
going to find” will be known only when the
discovery is made. The war isn’t over yet.
We haven’t even reached the first pub on the
way to Tipperary.
* * * *
Meanwhile some things which are going
to help shape Australia’s future can be
examined on the spot and at this
instant. There is. for instance, the
beautiful system of party Government,
which mainly consists of handing over pub-
lic affairs in turn to sets of warring parti-
sans, whose main object in life is to hang
on to the job amidst great uproar about the
iniquity of the ruffians who were last heaved
out and are frantically yelling to be given
another show. This riot proceeds in 14
places all the year round, and is maintained
at enormous annual exnense in support of
SOO principal barrackers, innumerable offi-
cials. cocked hats, bottle holders and
promises. And while all ihis rumpus is in
progress there is the further joyful vision
of a national Government that does not
govern the nation fumbling about with a
blunt tool called the Constitution. Every-
one admits this instrument is badly in need
of repairs, but everyone violently insists
that it must not be touched in the way
anyone else suggests. Incidentally. Aus-
tralia’s brilliant future is being partly
assured by having seven Parliaments in re-
serve. to see that taxation is not allowed to
fall into neglect, this being, of course, a
matter of vital importance, as it is well
known that no nation ever achieved distinc-
tion if it neglected to have seven Treasurers
dipping simultaneously into the public pocket.
Nor can the monumental Australian debt
be huddled away out of sight as a factor
in making the days to come brilliant. It
stands at somewhere about £400,000,000, is
leaping up like the thermometer at Bourke
when the sun gets a fair chance, and the
£15,000,000 or so required by Cohen as
interest every year is steadily growine. A
lot of this debt has been sunk in valuable
assets. Also a lot of it has been dropped
down the sewer and shovelled away on
waste, and loaf and bloat and the building
that is full of ants and the bridge that was
washed away and never turned up again.
Incidentally, a large slice of it is nowadays
being expended on suits and boots and gun-
powder and beef, all of which are doomed to
perish long before the chief clerk can tally
up the cost. But it is all going to be lumped
together to decorate the future that is to
dazzle the Australian kid with admiration
for the jag the old man had.
Yet in spite of all the bloomers perpe-
trated by Greed and Recklessness and Igno-
rance —notwithstanding the hideous load of
debt, the insane multiplication of Govern-
ments and the throttling of the public con-
science—Australia’s future can be made a
brilliant one. It is a country rich in almost
everything—a cradle in which an infant
Democracy may be reared to the full stature
of manhood. But talking about the future
is no good. Work is the thing that counts,
and on Australia the obligation of working
for the future rests as heavily as it has
rested on any other nation the world has
known. Escape from the constitutional
chaos is only possible by work. Emancipa-
tion from the clutch of the bondholder, from
the ravenous army of exploiters who prey
on the toil and enterprise of the nation,
from the shameless crowd' of political
dodgers whose conception of national service
is expressed by an lOU—from all these and
from the prevailing strike lunacy and im-
porting mania and social disorganisation
plain, honest work with brain and hand will
alone yield ways and means of rescue. The
exact conditions that will be created by the
European war are not knowable. Perhaps
they do not greatly matter. What can be
counted on without much fear of mistake is
that the termination of the ghastly business
will leave the world dripping blood long
afterwards—a world, in part, at any rate,
broken, impoverished and wretched, turning
miserably to the job of building up the
ruins. This being so, let any patriotic Aus-
tralian, to whom hot air about the brilliant
future has less appeal than considerations
of practical moment about the present, ask
himself what his country is doing to pre-
pare for the days to come. He will find that
the national Parliament has bolted to cover,
leaving questions relating to Australian in-
dustry untouched. He will see land settle-
ment, one of the paramount needs of Aus-
tralia, being dealt with on lines that are
monstrously unjust to the people of to-day
and to-morrow. He will hear of industrial
turmoil from every point of the compass; of
acting Prime Ministers attempting to
compromise with law-breaking strikers by
suggesting that they should work four
days a week; of the taxpayers’ cash
being wasted as if it were water;
of administrative muddle, waste and in-
competence ; of political cowardice, deceit
and ineptitude. Mouthings about Austra-
lia’s brilliant future are easy and cheap—
and futile. If we were honest with our-
selves we would confess that they are used
almost always as a subterfuge for avoiding
the duties of the present. That is not the
way to make the future brilliant. It merely
makes certain of a crop of snakes.
* * * *
Australia’s future depends in the main
upon the thoroughness with which the poli-
ticians apply themselves to getting out of
debt, to encouraging production of the things
Australia uses and other people want; to
the extension of public enterprise that will
be the real thing; to the suppression of all
intoxicated imitations thereof: to upending
the disastrous institution called Bloat or
Boom, which is the progeny of Borrow; to
making the land less of an instrument of
extortion ; and to banishing an outrageously
prodigal system of government. To go on
from year to year floundering further into
debt for the special enrichment of importers
and land sharks and Norton Griffiths
syndicates is sheer madness. To go on
depending upon the manufacturers of other
countries for the finished products of the
raw material which Australia yields is
lunacy. And, while doing these things, to
blither about the brilliant future is to work
off a weary old gag that was doing disreput-
able service half a century ago.
TWO AUSTRALIAS OR ONE?
When the war gathers up its ambulances
and folds away its hymns of hate a great
body of adventurers of the keen Homeric
sort will be liberated to take their part in
the stirring deeds of peace. Hundreds of
thousands of men in the armies of the Allies
who have lived through the shocks of doom
will find the old village too small for them
and the old fields too narrow. Earth’s wider
and emptier lands will call to them. The
big thing to be done and the big reward to
b? reaped will send those whose souls have
been furnaced in the flames of modern battle,
and whose bodies have been trained to the
hardships of camp and trench, to seek fresh
homes on the outer edge of civilisation. To
such pioneers of a world-march an intelli-
gent searching of the map will show nothing
better than Northern Australia. Already
attracted to throw in their lot wiih the race
that went surfing under the enemy’s fire at
Anzac and laughed in the teeth of the big-
gest war-task of the ages, many will find the
goal of their desire in the country south of
Darwin, where the coming peace has larger
prizes to offer to the strong man than in any
other part of the planet. It is good to pro-
phesy on a sure thing; and nothing seems
surer than that the after-the-war tides of
adventure will set towards our own northern
shores. Only two years ago the regret that
the pioneering spirit was dead amplified itself
in reasons why it should be dead; to-day,
with civilisation itself in the melting-pot, it
can be stated positively that the pioneering
spirit has come to life again and that by
the time the guns cool nothing else will be
quite so vigorous.
* * * *
It is every way to be desired that soldier-
settlers should find their way. to Australia,
and particularly to those regions where in
doing the best for themselves they may help
to solve one of our own biggest problems.
Not only have we room for any number of
men of British race, but the Northern Terri-
tory, being of huge extent and favored both
in soil add climate, should provide homes
for any number of others who have served
in the Allied armies. The human refuse.of
European cities will have little opportunity
and less desire to come. The multiplication
of odd-jobbers in our existing cities is no
way desirable; but if the troopships of the
allied nations keep busy for 10 years dis-
charging living cargo of the war-hardened
sort on our northern coast it will be to the
advantage of the Commonwealth. Every
soldier-settler making his home on the
warmer side of the twenty-fourth parallel of
latitude adds to the permanent citizen garri-
son of the continent and at the same time
brings the time nearer when we may reason-
ably claim to be in effective occupation of
the top half of Australia. Farther, the
enlargement of natural producticn through
an increase of population of the best kind
must steadily lighten the war burden which
Australians, in common with all who are
taking part in the struggle against the Ger-
mans and their friends, will be railed upon
to carry. However long and hard the task
of downing the Kaiser may prove to be, the
limitless food supplies which can be raised
in this continent must make our lot every
way more desirable than that of peoples
whose normal harvest of beef and grain
comes too near the border line cf famine;
and with a further and fuller development
of our resources the inevitable after-the-war
depression might touch us lightly enough.
* * * *
Yet while the settlement of the Northern
Territory and of our other waste lands must
be regarded as good business, it is quite
possible by clumsy and cow-thoughted states-
manship to turn it into about the last and
worst thing in curses. At present the Terri-
tory counts its white population by dozens,
and a friendly and popular person might
easily be acquainted with every individual
in the community; next year, or the year
after, there might quite easily be as many
people there as there are in the city of
Sydney. Such a sudden influx of settlers
must bring with it a new wave of thought
which is apt to crystallise into new ideals
as foreign to those of Australia as if they
had sprung to life in the backblocks of Arabia
or on the shores of West Africa. It is not
reasonable to suppose that the present in-
habitants of the Northern Territory, even
with a horse-doctor at the helm of State
and the A.W.U. dictating the conditions of
labor, could infuse into the new settlers the
ideas that have been slowly and painfully
evolved in the south-eastern corner of the
continent. Those ideas are the result of a
century’s experience under Australian condi-
tions ; and good men as the new soldier-
settlers may be, it is scarcely to be expected
that they can leap in a moment to conclu-
sions slowly arrived at by the people of the
Commonwealth and still opposed by those
among themselves who see the world "through
a mist of imported rags and hear tiie national
call through a babel of shoddy shibboleths.
The sudden military settlement of the
Northern Territory, though desirable from
the point of view of effective occupation or
defence, must on the present basis carry
with it a danger of disruption and a menace
of internal strife, because the new settlers
overwhelming the old by mere numerical
strength would be entirely isolated from the
thought centres of the Commonwealth. There
wculd, in effect, be two Australias differing
in object and aim and merely joined together
in a mechanical way by the smell of the
camel that slowly follows the pad along the
course of the pledged but forgotten railway.
The sea connection between the south-east-
ern ports and those of the Territory would
be of little account. Northern Australia is
for all practical purposes as far from Mel-
bourne and Sydney as from the Straits
Settlements or Burmah, and there, would be
no special reason for even a trade link with
the older States of the Commonwealth. The
exports of produce from the newly-settled
areas, would be carried to Europe. Asia and
America direct from the northern ports, and
the imports would come by the same road.
Except for a sentimental and official bond
Northern . and Southern Australia would
have nothing at all in common, and with the
progress and development at the top side of
the continent the gap of sympathy would
naturally widen.
* * * *
To have two Australias thus divided must
be in the nature of calamity. All the ele-
ments of the trouble which culminated in the
grim and gory struggle between the colder
and warmer ends of the United States would
be given a chance to take deep root. The
new' settler, isolated and left largely to shift
for himself, would probably yell for black
and brow'll immigration, and welcome as
friendly aid those very schemes of the ex-
ploiter of discolored labor which older Aus-
tralia has long throwm on the scrapheap. In-
terference with his plans or ideas bv those
on the other side of the camel pad would
breed distrust and enmity, and the notion of
an undivided continent, white and self-con-
tamed, would be harder and harder to main-
tain. Yet, were the new soldier-pioneers
brought into direct and vital contact with
the leal Australia from the start, none of
these things could be. The strangeness of
the land, the unaccustomed conditions of life
and all the rest, would not for long prevent
the force and truth of Australian ideals per-
meating the living mass of eager and enth,
siastic home-builders. There could be no in
of division no widening gap 0 f misunder
standing The new and the old would become
one people and the biggest Australians of
all might be those who 10 years before wi
never crossed the borders of their native
county or department. The unity 0 f thi«
continent depends upon the faithful adlie
ence of the Commonwealth to the Died™
given to South Australia that the railwav
from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek would hi
completed. That pledge is a piece of pane!
which cannot be torn up or trampled upon
except at the nation’s gravest peril, if
railway is not constructed in time l ar Ji
settlement in the Northern Territory i ust
the nature of things be dangerous to our
unity as a people. The line is not one which
can be laid down and set running in a few
days. It is a work of years, and at best
cannot be pushed ahead with sufficient speed
to catch up with the rapidly-changing condi
tions of the world. Hitherto political per-
sons of narrow view have passed it bv
because it did not seem to lead the wav to
any voter’s backyard; but even on this'low
plane of consideration the political persons
are making a mistake. On all appearances
the backyards wall be there before the rail-
way ; and the spirit animating those who
chain up the dog at the rear fence may be
one of bitter hostility alike to the tardy rail-
way and to those who broke their plighted
word with regard to its construction.

The Return of Ulysses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[All the events in the story of Ulysses as told by
Homer, are subsidiary to the main plot, which con-
centrates on the return of the wanderer and the
destruction of those who have been profaning his
house.]
Pharaoh is dreams and dust; but these
have seen
The white dawn breaking where his palace
walls
Lean on the ancient desert, and the moon
Afloat upon the long, slow tide that falls
Through sands and memories to the delta
green
Where all that was of glory sinks a-swoon.
Smothered in dreams of all that might have
been.
The Libyan sunset’s mystery of fire
Above the ruined shrines of world-old fears
Spake to them through the silence like a song
Blown out of perished stars. Ghosts of
dead years
About them moving in the sunlight strong
Cringed their salaams to life; and each day’s
pyre
Burned with white incense, blent of spice
and tears,
Thronging the sense with magic of desire.
They grew to stature here. Sand-weary
men,
Sinewed with toil and bronzed with that full
flame
That lit a .daily furnace in their veins,
From Egypt’s bondage-marches lightly came,
Rich with a tested manhood’s subtler gains,
Feeling the world and counting, one to ten,
Their strength to overthrow it, deed and
name—
The page was white; their purpose found
the pen.
The narrow sea, whose heritage of woe
The laughter of Levantine waves forget,
To them was high adventure’s open road;
And that Aegean blue, whose waters fret
The storied isles whereon the white gods
sowed
Earth’s green, young harvests, beckoning
seemed to glow,
Half wistful, with a sigh of long regret,
To strong men keen with pride to feel and
know.
Out of the dawning grey to that wild steep
That owned the sceptre of Miltiades
When Asia bled to shame at Marathon
The black fates called along the level seas.
They heard, they rose, the time of waiting
gone,
The tryst of stubborn valor theirs to keep;
They wrought the deed that age-long his-
tories
Shall hold untarnished in their caskets deep.
The laughter in the face of terror flung
The gay, clear purpose in the ranks of pain,
The tempest of their onrush and the stand.
Through weary months of bitter labor vain.
While hope, unflinching, spun his ropes of
sand
And planless system wrought the death that
stung
More than the Turkish bullets’ murderous
rain
Or the mad song by flying shrapnel sung.
And these were ours, and these again return,
The men dream-widened, full of puipose new.
A world-hope dragging at their tunic sleeve,
The thrill of every bugle call that blew
Confusion to a world of make-believe
Thrilling their full man-pulses. These shall

Let Us Come Out of the Clouds.
Maurice Blackburn, M.L.A. (Vic.),writes
to The Bulletin :
You sav “conscription of wealth” is “a high-
falutin’ term for taxation.” Why “high-falutin’ ”
unless you are ready to add “and conscription of
men is "a high-falutin’ term for universal service”?
To which this paper makes answer that it
has no sort of objection at all to the term
“universal service,” which it very frequently
uses. All it wants to see is things called by
their proper names, and hang the conse-
quences. Blackburn encloses the procla-
mation of the 23rd August by the French
Convention of ’93 imposing a progressive
income-tax to meet the cost of the war
against Prussia and Austria, and winds up
this way:—
I say that the cost of the present war should be
borne by the superfluity of the well-to-do. I do not
care whether by tax or by loan so long as the loan
is raised by compulsion and without interest... .It
is proper that, the wealth of this country being at
stake, it should be charged with the cost of meeting
these demands.
To which The Bulletin again remarks
that in a general way it has no objection,
but that Blackburn’s observations- are a
mighty long way from meeting the sugges-
tion put in these columns that advocates of
“conscription of wealth” should say exactly
what they want to do and how they propose
to do it. The whole point of the criticism
levelled against them in this paper is that
they are merely talking at random, and this
assurance from Blackburn that they are
indifferent whether the cost of the war is
discharged by taxation or compulsory loan
without interest merely makes matters worse
than before. Taxation is the instrument of
wealth-conscription. For instance, there are
incomes coming within the British, Federal
and State dragnet which are paying
13s. 7 \d. in the pound. There are estates
which on probate will have to pay up to 50
per cent. Is that not conscription of
wealth? True, there are other forms of
wealth which, escape with a shockingly in-
adequate impost; but the power of taxation
■is there to make the conscription more ad-
equate if the politician could only be induced
to use it instead of talking nebulosities. But
maybe Blackburn wants more than an
income tax can realise. “Tax the wealth,”
his party says—“not merely the income.”
But how can the State heavily tax
unrealised wealth —unless brother Black-
B . URN visualises some tremendous opera-
tion in which citizens would stagger
U P .to the Treasury counter and de-
posit thereon their coal-mines and their
vacant sections and their crops of onions
.and their steamers, and their furnished
apartments for bachelors, and their mangles,
and the multitudinous other things which
represent wealth? To talk about a “loan”
of that sort is as futile as to produce the
proclamation of the French Convention as
relevant to the prevailing controversy.
Bhin a year or two of that proclamation
the Directory found itself in the midst of
Widespread bankruptcy, .burdened by the
terrible mess created by successive issues of
assignats. That is the way other countries
besides France have raised “compulsory
loans : and if there is anyone in Australia
mad enough to imagine that a compulsory
loan through a depreciated paper currency
would he a desirable innovation to establish
betore exhausting the possibilities of con-
scripting wealth by taxation, the sooner such
a person is suppressed as a noxious weed or
under the War Precautions Act the better,
f. in conscription of wealth” talk is wordy,
iotny bunkum, generated by well-meaning

The Lesson of the Zep.
li’ is astounding that the British Govern-
ment, being the least military-minded of all
governments engaged in the war, should
I ractically have sat still and waited for
■eppelin raids,_ on the bluff that they are of
no military importance.” If the conser-
ve s ' van king War Office and the Admi-
<uty had no thought to spare for the pro-
ection of civilian lives and property, then
\ ~' as a matter for the attention of the
uii government. An aerial police force,
'rmed with bombs and machine guns, in
P ace of the _ batons and revolvers of ordi-
aiy territorial police, is England’s obvious
: c oes . sit y> i* that vast concentration camp
a mixed humanity is to be preserved from
gusts of destruction. And if one Govern-
S f unr cadiness to take adequate mea-
*res tor civil defence is so astounding as
to be incomprehensible, what shall be said
the Governments that have allowed
b, < i;i Wa, e *° rema in for IS months in the
Tii dS ar^ a ic military and naval experts?
j' s “iads are obsessed with old
lical doctrines and modern scientific
theories concerning their antique professions,
and their eyes are wilfully blind to the signs
of new things. What intelligent person can
question that the victories of the future will
be won in the air? Trench and submarine
fighting, poison gassing, and guns that shoot
oyer 20 miles of land or sea are the last
hicks of a dying system. The Germans
sounded the knell of their own organised
militarism when they first dropped a bomb
on a defenceless town. Why waste millions
of pounds and tens of thousands of lives in
getting an army into position to bombard a
city or capture another army if, at com-
paratively trifling cost in lives and money,
aerial battalions can be equipped which will
each drop 20,000 huge poison bombs a day
on trenches, railway stations, bridges, gas-
ometers, barracks and commissariat depart-
ments? To say that nothing of the sort
has been yet attempted is not to say that it
cannot be done. Everything of “military
significance” which has been achieved in the
air thus far has been controlled by men who
live on the old-fashioned military game.
But since the Zeppelins have warned the
civilian world to expect to be murdered in
its bed because it has no means of keeping
murderers away, the nations will demand
that their war-offices and naval offices shall
be shifted to the clouds, so to speak. The
Kaiser, who is always considering the pos-
sibilities of war in the present and future.
i 3 reported to have opposed the policy of
sending Zeppelins to rain Sheol on crowded
cities. He approved of all forms of German
frightfulness save this, rumor says. And
rumor probably speaks the truth. The
Kaiser was far-sighted enough to perceive
that raids which suggest potentialities for
the destruction of a million citizens, but
are alluded to by offioahs as matters of “no
military significance,” must inevitably tend
to reduce Germany’s masterful military sys-
tem to an absurdity. The greatest of old-
fashioned armies on earth, equipped with
all the marvels of modern military science,
could, a few vears hence, merely mobilise to
be slaughtered by 50.000 aviators flying
around in sportive detachments like exag-
gerated football teams. It is only because
the dull masses of non-combatants have not
yet taken the Zep. lesson to heart that the
present system of militarism has been tole-
rated. But the dull masses are waking up.
Paris is proposing the formation of an Inde-
pendent Aviatory Corps. And England
grows equally tired of meekly enduring air
raids that kill the baby without having the
least military significance.”
The Alien in Public Places.
“North Ward” says a word for the defence:
The inflamed patriot who cries aloud (B. 27/1/ 16)
for the blood of Breinl, Director of the Aus-
tralian Institute of Tropical Medicine at Townsville,
is credited with knowing what he is talking about.
The present writer holds no brief for the importa-
tion of foreigners to fill Australian positions, but he
knows that Breinl has done six years of very useful
Australian work, even if he does happen to have been
born in Austria. Tropical diseases are not hard to
find in our North if one knows how to look for them;
and as returned troops are bringing back plenty more
from abroad, the present is no time to get rid of
our best expert.
Breinl was recommended for appointment to the
then-newly-formed Institute of Tropical Medicine, in
19C9, by Major Ross, head of the Liverpool School
of Tropical Medicine. He had worked under Ross’s
direction for practically all his professional life, and
Ross is the world’s greatest authority on. tropical
disease. Breinl’s first two years of Australian work
were so good that the Australasian Medical Congress of
1911 gave the Commonwealth Government a strong
hint that it should take over the Institute altogether ;
and the Director was then given a new laboratory
and three qualified assistants, of whom only one, Dr.
Priestly, was an Australian graduate. All three
were selected by Professor Allen, of Melbourne, and
Professor Anderson Stuart, of Sydney. Brkinl’s
term of appointment was extended before the war
began, on the advice of the committee of manage-
ment ; and the recently-published collected papers of
the Institute furnish a record of which any similar
organisation might be proud. As for Breinl s
alleged “broken English,” he speaks with considerably
less accent than does any reasonably braw Scot frae
Aberdeen, or frae any other place where the haggis
plant blooms.
When war broke out the Resident Surgeon of the
Townsville Hospital volunteered; and, at the request
of the committee, the Austrian expert took his place
till another man could be obtained. For this he
received nothing. Later, when the next man left,
the committee again asked him to take over the job,
and release another medical man for military duty.
The Townsville-born applicant of whom mention is
made had graduated only a few months before. A
hospital of this size is beyond the capacity of a
fledgling of necessarily limited experience. More-
over, it is the obvious duty of young medical grad-
uates to get to the Front instead of hanging about
after big jobs at home. Breinl and the committee,
by keeping the young applicant out, have thus
released another possible recruit. “The man in the
wet trench” may be more interested in this fact
than in the amount of Bheinl’s salary.
Further, Dr. Priestly, the quarantine officer, is
bacteriologist at the Tropical Institute. He did not
go for a “jaunt to Brisbane,” but for a jaunt to
Sydney in order to work 14 hours a day at a con-
ference on malaria amongst returning troops. As a
naturalised alien, Breinl would require a permit
from the military authorities before he could board
vessels. What particular mischief he is capable of
working on vessels during a quarantine inspection I
can’t even guess; but I do know that the diseases
would not get past, which is a comforting reflection
despite the fact that a Townsville-born youth with
aggravated patriotic principles and small experience
wasn’t on guard.
A few other matters on which the “man in the
wet trench” might like to be advised are:—
(1) Why single out Breinl alone amongst the
numerous enemy-born men in the medical profession
and the Government services?
(2) What will happen ii we disorganise the Aus-
tralian Institute of Tropical Medicine at the present
juncture when hundreds of Australians are returning,
or about to return, with trouical troubles?
(3) Whether the Townsville-born graduate of an
Australian University has vet volunteered for mili-
tary duty with the Australian Expeditionary Forces?
When the Cocky-worm Turned.
And so it will be written in the memoirs of
P. N. Mongers, who lived at the time of the
Great War: —•
... .and strikes followed one another so quickly
that the Courts which had been established to pre-
vent strikes became overloaded with work and holi-
clays, and nobody took any notice of them. But we
did our best, which was pretty bad, until the idea
seized us that as we had made a triumphant mess
of fixing wages we could make a splendid success
of fixing prices. Whereupon we got really busy and
started on wheat, another Court having been set
up to show how it should be done. There had been
a drought, and as the coekv-worm, which pro-
duces the wheat, seemed to think that because he
had very little wheat to sell he ought to get more
than when he had a lot, we had to put him in his
place. He was put there promptly—at ss. a bushel
—and we were able to talk much guff to the people
who didn’t grow wheat about “cheap bread.” We
also reproached the cocky-worm in his absence with
being a grasping plutocrat, and in his presence
we told him that we had really saved him from an
awful disaster—concerning which, however, we did
not go into details.
We made money on that wheat deal; but as the
cocky-worm didn’t have enough wheat to grab, we
had to rush orders away for foreign wheat —and we
didn’t make any money then. Some of it turned
up accompanied by weevils and other unnutritious
animals. And some of it was left waiting by the
distant shore for ships, and no ships were available.
When we at last got one lot heaved into a ship the
blessed old tub took fire; and —but why go over
these horrors ? After great delay they culminated
in wheat (and animals) being dumped on us at
7s. 3d. when any amount of the cocky-worm’s new
wheat could be got at 4s. 6d. Then the infernal
Court decided that the worm’s original crop was
worth more than we had collared it at, and told us
to hand out another £30,000. (N.B. —We narrowly
escaped prosecution for issuing a faked balance-sheet
that time.)
Meanwhile we had a shot at fodder and before
long had to lie good and hard and start a Blending
Department. Butter gave us a severe jolt. It is
suspected that the Yankee saw us coming. Anyhow,
the populace smelt what he was sending along, and
if it hadn’t been for the presence of mind of the
Crown Law Dept., which advised that the butter
be deported to London for treatment by experts,
something like a pestilence would have struck our
fair young land. But we kept the price of butter
down when there was no butter, and we showed the
cocky-worm that he was not going to exploit people
who wanted to pay 2s. 6d. for butter when he
couldn’t supply any at Is. 6d.
Then came the momentous Milk Crisis. Acting
on the well-known Rnle of Thumb relating to the
treatment of the cocky-worm, the Court decreed
that the price of milk should be lOd. a gallon,
whereupon all the cocky-worms in the land rose up
as one worm in a forest of whiskers, told the Court
to go where the Barrier miners suggest another Court
should permanently reside, and announced that their
price was lid., and if they didn’t get lid. Sydney
would get no milk. Whereupon the Court hurriedly
assembled, consulted the Rule of Thumb, and said
10 But the rebellious cocky-worm still yelled
lid., and the situation was only saved by the Min-
istry loudly telling the Court it was a Blithering
Ass and that lid. was a proper price. In this we
acted on the sound principle that the safest place
is where there is no danger.
Of course we couldn’t say anything just then
about cheap milk for the masses, but we promptly
premised to nationalise beer in some indefinite way
at an unspecified date, and thus got a chance to
recover our second wind and see about a new loan.

The Eternal Problem of "Booze.
So far the evidence available goes to show:
(1) That in Sydney, where the local pub keeps
open until 11 p.m., there is considerable drinking
among soldiers, with occasional scraps afterwards.
(2) That in Melbourne, where the tap is under
orders to turn itself off at 10 o’clock, there is more
irrigation and frequent battles between pints.
(3) That in Perth, where Bung shuts down at 9
o’clock, there is a tremendous guzzle, accompanied by
sieges, knock-outs, riots and bash.
(41 That up Bananaland way, where the business
of getting ready to fight is considered of more im-
portance than taking to drink, nothin? particular
happens to the pub or the public or the troops.
All of which seems to be a fairly good argu-
ment in favor of the view repeatedly ex-
pressed by Tiie Bulletin, that the wild
clamor about shutting the pub an hour or
two earlier is of infinitely less importance,
in relation to the problem presented by the
drunken soldier, than the proper management'
of the training camps. Excessive drinking
by soldiers who are supposed to be training
for participation in a nerve- and tissue-
wracking form of warfare is a scandal.
There is far too much of it. And it is
accompanied by worse abominations. And
the cause is that the drinking is done out
of bounds, instead of in the camps, under
disciplinary restraint. Meanwhile, in N. S.
Wales, after apologising to the wowsers for
calling them wowsers, Holman has lifted up
his voice to remark that he is in favor of
nationalising the drink business, and that
the public “should be given an opportunity”
to vote on the subject. As a contribution
to the controversy about Billjim’s beer,
this is worth less than 2d. Nationalisation
of Bung’s business could under the most
favorable conditions be realised only after
prolonged uproar. But nationalisation of
Billjim’s beer, which is the commodity the
present argument or bellowing is about,
could be accongilished to-morrow; where-
upon a repetition of the outrageous occur-
rences of the past IS months would be cut
out, and the efficiency of the soldiers would
be greatly increased. That this is not done
is simply because Pearce objects to it. From
which the only conclusion is that Pearce
is as usual “greatly pleased” with what
most Australians regard as a monstrous
illustration of administrative inefficiency and
social disorder.
Andrew Fisher, to an interviewer in
London :— ■
No doubt there will be a flow of people to the
distant dominions after the war.
Will there? If Australia is able to offer
people who might flow hitherwards ready
access to land and employment in industry
the stream might be looked for with reason-
able confidence. But just at present the job
of getting farms for our own few men when
they come flowing back from the Front is
wearing the aspect of a stupendous under-
taking. Also, there is an almost unanimous
determination not to handle the problems of
industry in advance, but to postpone matters
until some unspecified time in the future.
Apparently everything is going to depend on
the flow of IOU. But if Coiien hangs on to
his ducats and J. Bull purges himself of
a rotten land system and gets rid of his Free-
trade mania and sets to work building up
what the war is knocking into a cocked hat,
there isn't going to he any more flow than
can be detected in the “river” at the national
capital.
Novelist Rider Haggard, who is coming
out to Australia again to “investigate the
opportunities for land settlement,” was one
of an English committee that arrived on the
same business a few years ago. He is best
remembered as a tireless talker with a vast
capacity for being photographed alongside a
pumpkin or a cow. Haggard says that
land settlement is the most vital of
post-war problems. But that is- the
truth divided by two or three. The
other part of the problem is to shake the
land from the grasp of monopoly; to make
the ownership of land a mighty expensive
luxury to anyone but the man who will use
it; to end the scandal which makes specula-
tion in land values a source, of profit. If the
problem is tackled from this end settlement
would be easy. As it is now, the main ques-
tion is not settlement of the land, but settle-
ment of the mortgage.

The Broken Hill miners are still trying to
make the public believe that, in the interests
of their health, they are fighting for a 44-
hour week. The plain truth is they are
fighting against Arbitration and the Labor
party’s own Arbitration law. At first they
rushed Justice Higgins’s Court, and would
have nothing to do with the State Court.
They felt quite sure of Higgins. But after
they had met him they didn’t feel quite so
sure, so Higgins and Arbitration were
turned down. When the Port Pirie men
refused to strike and a mass meeting was
called a delightfully disingenuous proposal
was made which gave the whole show away,
—“That the Broken Hill miners be advised
to accept Arbitration and that we pledge
ourselves to strike if their demand for a
44-hour week is not granted by the Court.”
A crowd that is prepared to make a drab
of the adopted Labor policy, using it when
it suits and pushing it into the gutter when
it is done with, is an insidious enemy of
the Labor party; and it is discreditable that
there should have been any division at all in
official Labor circles on that question.
- «
The Hun is not the only person in the world
who is seeing red. During the last month
two barrowloads of letters have arrived at
the office of this paper demanding law’n-
order. Some of the suggested methods of
getting it are :
The appointment of a Dictator.
Calling on G. Reid to come back.
Prohibiting public meetings.
Seizure of all the dairy cows in the Common-
wealth.
Also, wdiat seems a saner proposition than
most of the others: —
Shooting the first man who, by direct or indirect
means, hinders or tries to hinder us from crushing
the bloodstained enemy.
All of which forms fairly convincing evidence
that a lot of people are going off their joint
and several head. The Dictator idea may be
good; but there would certainly be trouble
over the selection. The N.S.W. Labor party
would be bound to nominate Dick Meagher,
and the Northern coalfields would want
Darcy. Anyhow, the High Court would find
it w r as outside the Constitution at some poini
or other. Nor would the capture of Straw-
berry help things much, because after the
State had climbed over Cocky’s remains and
secured the animal its guardians would
naturally go on strike, and the milk and
butter cease to develop before the Arbitra-
tion Court got back from the long vacation,
whose other name is Tasmania. But the
shooting business looks more practical, the
only difficulties being to know exactly where
to knock off and to supply the executioners
with munitions. Still no harm would be
done by rounding up all the foreign-traders
and loan-mongers and anti-fighters and party
wirepullers to commence with. Then a start
could be made on owners of slums, land
sharks and produce-dealers; and having sent
that lot to the crematorium, there would be
a chance for sorting out the politicians and
giving those of them who have ever
played bridge with a syndicate one in
the neck to go on with. Of course, it
wouldn’t make any difference to the Hun ;
but as everybody is abusing everybody else
for being a striker or a capitalist or a wow-
ser, or something, this general all-round
shoot ought to be a popular move, with votes
in it for somebody. And what else matters?

When it comes to recovering a reasonable
percentage of valuable residuum from the
human scrap-heaps of the gaols, the Victorian
Government continues to show itself a
mucker. Chief Secretary Donald McLeod,
who has been considering a scheme
for planting trees with convict labor,
has made public the fact that, “while
the need for putting a certain class of
prisoners to profitable work has been mani-
fested, the Indeterminate Sentences Board
has not been able to do anything by which
useful training could result.” For an ad-
mission of ineptitude this would be hard to
beat; yet it is only on a par with the gen-
eral industrial administration of the Vic-
torian gaols. A man is a poor thing, physi-
cally, if he can’t earn enough by his labor
to provide himself with simple food and
raiment, given the opportunity. Undoubt-
edly the average Victorian criminal isn’t of
so low a physical type as not to be able to
do this, and it is for the Chief Secretary to
see that the man gets his opportunity. No
other Liberal administrator has yet done it;
but that makes McLeod’s chance to win
distinction in a new field all the more envi-
able.
The kind of thing the Turk .no doubt gets
from his local paper :
Amongst the booty secured by our gallant army at
Gallipoli was a newspaper printed in English in Mel-
bourne, one of the towns in the country called Aus-
tralia, which has joined our enemies in despatching
troops to fight against the Crescent. The publica-
tion has been submitted to experts for translation,
and the result goes to show that the German can
learn a point or two from Australia in how to run
things. According to this print, the position in that
country a few weeks ago was that the war was re-
garded as of such supreme importance that every-
body was telling everybody else to go. There were
75 strikes in progress, and 243 were being arranged.


A Brilliant Magazine.
The February Triad points the fact that
this magazine is in many ways entirely dif-
ferent from all the others. Most magazines
specialise on one subject: the Triad rather
seems to specialise on all. Its theatrical
and musical criticisms are closely reasoned
and outspoken. It insists on the need of
naturalness, urges that the first thing
required in an actor or a singer is good Eng-
lish, or good French, or good Italian —
accuracy of pronunciation and so forth in
whatever language is spoken or sung. The
Triad has a good deal to say on public
questions, though it is emphatic in the state-
ment that it has no politics. It is indi-
vidualist : insists that the first duty of the
human creature is honestly and courageously
to express himself. Its humorous pages
may sometimes shock the timid soul, but the
humor is unforced and fresh. The Triad.
in short, is vital. It has no truck with
conventional opinions and ideas. In all
matters of thought and conscience it is
widely tolerant—too tolerant by half for
average precisians of conduct. It holds,
with Whitman, that one of the first duties
of man is to “loaf and invite his soul.” It
execrates religious intolerance. It holds
that all creeds are good so long as they are
sincerely held and lived. It is a very
friendly magazine, despite the occasional
severity of its criticism. It has a sustain-
ing faith that sweetens it.*

During a strike the workmen sit down and the plants
are idle, and it can at once be seen how valuable a
thing this is to a country which is bent on using all
its resources to defeat the enemy. The seven Govern-
ments which the country maintains for the sake of
national economy are therefore cordially co-operating
with the strikers. This enemy country is also con-
sidering the question of having no trade with Ger-
many at the conclusion of the war, and its 14 Houses of
Parliament have gone into a long recess so that the
matter may not be dealt with prematurely. There
is also the further ominous fact that the head of the
Government is writing letters to the people asking
them if they are prepared to assist in the war, and
assuring them they would readily enlist if he men-
tioned how seriously their services were required.
This is having wonderful results. Already the Jum-
bucks’ regiment had reached the coast 200 strong-
after a march of 216 miles along the railway line.
Also, 20 “Prickly Pears” having been accumulated
on a two-months pilgrimage from the interior were
immediately sent back by train to where they came
from for the purpose of being drilled without delay.
The organisation of these people makes them no con-
temptible enemy.
The Hit is Mightier than the Word.
How much longer are we going to lightly
piffle about being “bound to win”? A
dishonest and un-Britisli censorship set the
fashion, to begin with, and ever since we
have fooled ourselves with stories carrying
such headlines as “The Enemy Weakening”
and “Victory Certain.” There is not the
slightest evidence in the field that the enemy
is weakening. A year ago there were three
of him. To-day there are four. The Brit-
ish W ar Office estimates of enemy wastage
give no encouragement to accept the news-
paper “expert s’ statistics and his yarn
that in repairing the holes the German has
used up all the material he . started with.
In every direction but on the Western Front
the enemy has greatly extended the area of
Ins conquest, and to-day lie dictates the
strategy of the Allies. lie may be in a bad
way. His hopes of complete victory may
have vanished, though even that is very
doubtful. But between the enemy not win-
ning and the Allies giving him a hiding and
making the terms of peace to which he will
have to subscribe, there is a mighty differ-
ence. And this difference means everything
to the nations the Hun has assaulted. The
job ahead of us is one of staggering diffi-
culty; and we are much more likely to per-
form it by making every serviceable man
understand that he is wanted rather than
by repeatedly informing him that we are
bound to win anyhow. Few men go to war
for fun ; and under the voluntary system a
man only has to be told loudly enough that
the chap on the spot is going right through
t:> make him believe that he himself might
as well stay at home. Therefore this paper
solemnly exhorts young Australia to first get
it into his head that there is a fight for life
going on against a powerful, well-equipped
and enterprising enemy, and that the call
for help is far more insistent now than it was
,18 months ago. Having grasped that and a
gim, he will be able to read about the weak-
ening . of the enemy with more confidence
than if. he hadn't a bayonet to help in the
weakening. The evidence that the Allies
lequire all the strength they can summon
comes from our own men. The evidence
about the Hun comes from “neutral
observers” who tell us what they think we
want to hear —and who are telling the other
party the same thing at the same time.
The call of our own fellows ought to be
enough for ns.

Drips from the Frozen Front.
Some of the scraps that have come along
lately to furnish the banquet of news:—
Another Zeppelin raid on England and murder of
"'omen, children and unarmed citizens.
Capture of several British vessels in the Atlantic
by a German raider.
Zeppelin found in sinking condition off the Eng-
lish coast, and not found afterwards.
Statement that Britain had purchased large quan-
tities of wheat from Roumania. Then a report that
Germany had done likewise.
. Report that the Berlin Bourse was showing a
sharp recovery ; also report next day that it was in
a state of wild panic.
Relations between Germany and the U.S.A. said
to be growing graver, and more Notes being drafted.
Roumania once more about to join the Allies.
fighting on the French Front; preparations for
tremendous attack in the direction of Calais ; vague
misty yarns from the Balkans ; nothing much doing
in the Garden of Eden.
Russia throwing vast quantities of shells at the
enemy, and the enemy hurrying up reinforcements.
Meanwhile the winter is passing, and in a
month or two all hands will be at it again ;
but where it is going to happen or what it
is going to be is a matter no clearer
tjian the whereabouts of .Billjjm By the
time the ice has melted the point of Brother
M oodrow Wilson’s speeches may be a little
plainer, though it is fairly clear even now
that whatever the President may be think-
ing about he has come to see that at the
end of the argument a gun is a more reliable
implement for Uncle Sam to have on the pre-
mises than a copy of the “Polite Fetter
Writer.” To the German this must be an
unexpected revelation in frightfulness; for
with Woodrow in command it seemed as if
tilt last man would certainly perish on the
track to the post office before the last Note
was written. In Australia, on the other
hand, the last man would fall clutching the
last note he got in liquidation of strike pay.

“Fax” recalls Tiie Bulletin’s old theory
that there should always be at least one poet
at the War Office, to supply imagination:—
Old Hindenburg and the Kaiser, also Joffre,
Kitchener, French, Saruail, Grand Duke Nicholas
and the other Russian generals, learned tactics,
strategy and all the business details of ground fight-
ing in days when aviation was not yet in its infancy
and Zeps. had never been thought of. The men who
run this war are old, conservative experts with one
desire in common, viz., to prevent a sweeping amend-
ment of the old-fashioned militarism which is their
profession by blocking the radical system of air-
fighting which was not “in the game’’ when they
went to military school. What is true of the field-
marshals is true of the admirals of the fleets. They
are not disposed to encourage the development of all
the possibilities in sea-plane warfare. It wasn’t
in their game when they studied naval tactics and
got their first experience of naval gunnery. Conser-
vatism is strong on both sides. But the side which
is least pig-headedly conservative, least obstinately
blind to the signs of the times, and most patrioti-
cally open to conviction is going to win mainly by
force of aerial arms at the finish.
Dear Bulletin, —So many good Aus-
tralians responded to my appeal (B.
4/11/M5) for Bulletins for wounded Kan-
garoos that we had a pink post at the
British Australasian office by the first
available mail, delivered - in London on
December 28. It simply rained Bulletins,
and we were able to send a packet the same
day to every country hospital in England
containing Anzacs, and the rest are now
being personally distributed to the boys in
hospital in London, so that at least 2000
Tommy Kangaroos will have a happier New
Year than they might have done, thanks to
the people at home. If you could possibly
find room for this grateful coo-ee on hehaif
of the boys, I should be much obliged.—
Yours, Alice Grant Kosman.
The S. Aus. Government has bought for
closer settlement 44,000 acres of the Mount
Remarkable estate, near Wilmington and
Melrose, 200 miles north of Adelaide. It is
one of the old J. H. Angas properties, and
has long been run by the Willowie Land
Co. as a grazing proposition. Now the sheep
is to make way for the plough. The pur-
chase price is £142,000, which the baby
pays. Meantime, the co. takes an lOU

An amazing story has been told in connec-
tion with the struggle of a young man named
O’Donnell to get to the Front. He had
made soldiering his profession and was a
captain and an area-officer in Westralia,
and volunteered for the first lot, but was
held back. He went on making a nuisance
of himself trying to get away instead of
staying here and wearing nice, gold buttons
and getting rapid promotion, and at last
was permitted to enlist as a private. Then
he found things so unsatisfactory—his own
story is that they were purposely made un-
satisfactory—that he “deserted,” cleared to
another State, joined the force there as a
private, and was just off to the Front, when
he was “put away” by somebody or other
who has his own ideas about helping to win
this war for us. Then there was a court-
martial, and that’s all there is about it so
far except that Perth begins to make a row
and wants to knock a few stupid officers’
heads off. The fellow who wanted to go
away and do something is a son of O’Don-
nell, for years superintendent of Melbourne
detectives, and an all-round athlete who
would take some beating.
Sidney Kidman dropped in at an Adelaide
wool-sale last week and announced that he
allotted, on behalf of hims >lf, wife or part-
ners. 8.) bales to various patriotic funds;
also he offers 100 more if 10 other S. Aus.
weolgrowers will each do the same: also
£2OOO in each of the four States in which
he operates if 10 others will do the same.
Conditions in the “inside” are very mixed,
he says. North from Farina (S.A.) the
position “has never been worse.” In S. Aus.
and Queensland he has lost 60.000 cattle in
the past 10 months —in the latter State 75
per cent, on some holdings. However, a
little beyond the present terminus of the
Darwin rail at Oodnadatta three inches
have just fallen, and Queensland has had
six to eight inches, with a flood in the Dia-
mantina. “Taking Western Queensland
generally, everything there should be fat in
another three months.” Probably feeling
good in expectation thereof Kidman and
one or two others have just bought Wein-
teriga, formerly the Riddochs’ station, on
the lower Darling.

“Othello,” most domestic and compact of
classic melodramas in blank verse, is the
latest result of Marlow’s regenerated man-
agement at Melbourne Princess’s. Viewed
from the standpoint of Popular Prices the
production makes a very liberal bid for
public patronage. Compared with the
“Othello” of three or four .years ago
the thing most conspicuously wanting is an
Oscar Asche in the name-part. But there
are a number of good acting characters
besides the unreasonable colored gentleman
(Sliakspeare believed in giving every member
of the company a chance), and the general
effect of the performance is realistic enough.
Though many non-essential lines have been
neatly cut out, the surgeon doesn’t seem to
have removed any bits that matter much to
anybody save the argumentative Sliakspeare
Societies. The omission of the bedroom dis-
cussion between Desdemoiia and Emilia is
judicious because it gets the audience away
before 11 o’clock, when audiences begin to be
restless. Anyhow, the Willow Song is well
missed. It was a very suitable item for
Verdi to put to music in his “Otello” opera,
but in the drama it was always tiresome.
The only lines of bedroom dialogue that
might have been preserved were Mrs. lago’s
remarks on the sex-problem and the value of
Strict Propriety. Dear little Desdie, the
recent bride, used to say that she wouldn’t
be a giddy matron for the whole world,
whereas Mrs. lago, having been longer in
the matrimonial business, reckoned that the
whole world was a large consideration, and
lots of women would let propriety go at the
price.
* * * *
It was noticeable on Saturday night that
the new licensing law has already added
weight to Divine William’s great temperance-
sermon. “Othello” is really a temperance
sermon, although bygone ages have hastily
regarded it as a play on the passion of
jealousy. The Moor’s jealousy, however, is
directly due to the fact that Cassio can’t
take three drinks without losing his wits,
lago’s plot owes all its success to the evil
effects of strong booze. Had Cassio been an
earnest Rechabite the causes of Othello’s
jealousy never would have happened. But
the house didn’t know this when it applauded
Cassio’s lament re the liquid thief that men
put into their mouths. The applause had
the true ring, of up-to-date feeling in it. It
meant that the audience would have had the
pubs of Cyprus close at six, so that Cassio
couldn’t get drunk after dark. Robert Faulk-
ner, as Cassio, was a great improvement on
his Gratiano in the previous play. Also,
“CYDER FIRE,” AT SYDNEY CRT.
The American journalist (Louis Kimball)
is classed as an English spy on account of
his London hat.
AY alter Hunt was an easy, matter-of-fact
young lago. Despite a head of hair which
is more palpably false than his friendships,
llunt would be a notable villain of the play
if he had a wider range of facial expression
and a full supply of magnetic power. Champ-
uey is a good lioderigo of the stodgy kind ;
Fitzherbert, Cosgrove and others fill their
places; and Marcus St. John is quite ad-
mirable as Desdemona’s old dad, whose old-
ness is another reminder that the fathers of
Shakspeare’s heroines were invariably men
who married late in life. To have a 16- or
20-year-old daughter was to be a wrinkled
geeser with a straggling grey beard in the
Hard s time.

Miss Hunter-Watts, a disappointment as
iortia, was a pleasing surprise as the Moor’s
meek little wife —sw r eet and natural in the
p« rt T ?V SS Harvey did nicely as Bianca, and
Miss Yalentine Sydney put force into her in-
dignation when she rounded on Othello in
the bedroom. Allan Wilkie, in bumping up
against Melbourne’s recollection of Asclie gets
hurt on his weakest spot. His elocution is
P.oor by compaiison, and his Jewish enuncia-
tion. which served very well for Shylock
mars the effect of his Othello speech He
looked very well when he faced an unim-
pressive Senate in the first act, but his
address sounded like a lesson learned by
heart. Where the rich voice and clean enun-
o'ation of Oscar Asche was most effective
\v ilkie was least impressive. Nor was there
much pathos in his grief. It was his anger
that became hint best. Wilkie, who makes-up
as a brown Moor, rather than a blackamoor
is very genuine in his anger, and his acts
and deeds of violence are a warning to anv
good Australian girls who think of marrving
out of their color. ' g
It is this way. Ethel was in l 0 with
Captain Larry, and Captain Larrv was i.
love with Ethel. But Ethel was an heiress
and Captain Larry was poor. So he never
asked her. And Henry captured Ethel on the
rebound, secretly married her, and used her
to spy for him on the British fleet. Ethel
thought he was a French secret-service man •
but discovered, too late, that Henry was Hein’
rich, a German secret-service man, the owner
of a German wife and two children. Captain
Larry returns, rich, and finds Ethel poor
And they still love each other. So Ethel
decides to pretend to be a German spy i n
order to be an English spy, and Captain
Larry, she finds, is by profession a spy, too
All these complications occur before or during
the first long talky act. After that, there is
no more plot. Henry and Ethel and Captain
Larry cover each other in turn with revol-
vers, capture each other, accuse each other
and escape from positions of hideous peril
until in the end Heinrich is killed and Cap-
tain Larry personally saves the whole British
army and prevents the destruction of Paris.

But the plot doesn’t matter. “Under
Fire.” produced on Saturday evening at a
chastely re-decorated Sydney Criterion
Theatre, amid the pungent smell of undried
plaster and high explosives, depends solely
“UNDER FIRE.”
The wreck of Trench 27.
for its success upon its realistic presentation
of modern war. The arrival of the German
army at a Belgian village is a thrilling piece
of realism ; the scene at night in a British
trench achieves a sufficiently actual effect;
and the final scene of the wounded in a ruined
church is even more convincing. The author,
Boi Cooper Megrue, has merely put upon the
stage some of the incidents recorded in print
by U.S. correspondents of the fighting in the
early days of the war. Several of these in-
cidents are actually to be found in “The Red
Glutton,” by Irvin S. Cobh. The trench scene
is, unfortunately, post-dated. It is just before
the Battle of the Marne, yet the British
army is shown to have had the time to
construct an elaborate trench, and from
the dialogue it is assumed that they have
been there long enough to get accustomed to
trench warfare. And the final sensation,
the destruction of the trench ly a bomb
dropped by an aeroplane, is absurd. The
aeroplane does not fly by night.
There are 40 characters and four lan-
guages, though many are heard but not seen.
Lizette Parkes, as the heroine, is sufficiently
melodramatic if it were not for her stran-
gled voice. Beatrice Holloway, as the daugh-
ter of a murdered Belgian innkeeper, was so
sincerely pathetic in a small part that there
seems no artistic reason why she should be
billed for just one night. lan Maclaren makes
an excellent but stiff Ilun villain; James
Atholwood, as usual, makes the most of an
important character part, the Belgian inn-
keeper ; the best characterisation among the
horde of Ilun soldiery is that of James
Hughes as a sergeant: in the part of an irre-
pressible U.S. journalist Louis Kimball dis-
closes the possession of a stage personality;
and Frank Harvey, as the delightful hero
who, single-handed, saves the British Empire.
France and the Allies generally, once more
triumphantly proves himself an almost ideal
leading man in this sort of melodrama.

The success of “Under Fire” depends upon
whether the public wants approximately the
real thing on the stage. To many people the
real thing is altogether too real.
Among the performers engaged for Edward
Dyson’s “Fact’ry ’Ands,” to be produced at
Sydney Palace on February 26, are Carlton
Stuart (from “Potash and Perlmutter”), H.
11. Wallace (from the Niblo co.), Fanny
Erris (the Adelphi Theatre), and Gwen
Dorise (George Willoughby’s co.).

a iong first look at “Mother Goose.
Bvdnev Tivoli’s poet—the one who com-
Ihe beautiful rhymed ads. —is inconsol-
able over the departure of the 1915-1 G Follies
for Melbourne. At time of writing lie had
himself down on the S. M. Herald’s heartli-
!" l_ in front of the china dogs and the
,virble clock—and was roaring and kicking
it madly at the panderers who would pur-
,L S e his silence with sponge-cakes and
h,,‘iled lollies. But his grief is a foolish
waste of energy. The departed Follies
were bright, hut there will probably be
something just as good in their place.
At Alelbourne Royal they are preaching
the gospel of advertisement to fairly large
congregations. Of all the recent Yankee-
dollar comedies “It Pays to Advertise’ is
the most truly humorous. The spectacle of
voung Cyrus Martin, smiting sheets of fools-
cap with a rubber stamp, whilst Father sits
wondering how many dollars lie must pay to
buy out the bogus opposition firm, is extrava-
"aiitly funny. And the infectiousness of
'"{mbrose reale’s advertisement gags seems
unquestionable. Cyrus catches the awful dis-
ease from Ambrose and passes it on to
Father. You can almost see Father catching
it. After which you find yourself wondering
lmw long the King of Soap’s kingdom will

Cvrus to the position of Prime Alinister.

‘Mother Goose,” at Alelbourne Alajesty’s,
continues to supply the same old want. Pan-
tomime nowadays is the want of the old.
rather than an annual dissipation for the
young. It isn’t on account of the happy
scowling schoolboy that the girls file on to
a platform in front of the orchestra and
throw air-balloons at his grandfather. Per-
ish the superstition!
** * *
Frequent roars of approval at the King’s
on Saturday demonstrated that Alelbourne
is still susceptible to the innocent merriment
of “Charley’s Aunt.” Alost of the noise, of
course, was aroused by Charley’s bogus
relative, who was played by Henry Ford
with passable energy. Ford Hits through
the farce successfully, cuddling the available
girlhood and squinting radiantly on the
amorous Spettigue, but he hasn’t quite the
tempo or the temperament for the role of
Donna Lucia. Both his interest and his legs
appear to flag at odd times, and his careless
changes of voice in the wrong places further
impair the reality of the counterfeit aunt.
Barring Ethel Dane, all the people who were
prominent in “The Glad Eye” and other
spicy jokes appear in this revival of the
diverting classic. Shelford, whose humorous
possibilities as a gaunt and angular Donna
have been apparently overlooked, is sen-
tenced to play the comparatively unappeal-
ing Jack Chesney for the term of auntie’s
unnatural life. Shelford is right enough in
his unaffected cheeriness of demeanor, but
he obviously shares with the audience an
entire lack of enthusiasm for his job of
making love to Aliss Pearl Hellmrich. The,
lady is accused of being Shelford’s best girl,
but Tiie Bulletin dismisses the charge for
want of evidence. Anyhow, Aliss Hellmrich

never shows any emotional interest in her
bloque, and carries on a love-talk as if she
were a chaperon mentioning the price of
provisions to a young man who was staying

bas plenty of sugar for the role of Charley’s
fiancee. Indeed, seeing thar Charley
(Edmund Slierras) is rather cool and inani-
mate in his courtship, it is not unkind to
remark that she has enough sugar for both.
Bradley affects a warm alcoholic coloring
for the. part of Spettigue, and is generally
tunny in his sentimental futility. Landor
appears, naturally eminent for a superior
servant’s semi-repose, and the only fault
about Tilton is that his voice doesn’t match

of the secrets is a monstrous man-eating
shark in the act of attacking a diver. Had

Alsace and Lorraine are causing the larg-
est flourish of adjectives in Alelbourne Bijou
announcements this week. The couple, who
are alleged to come from Amurka, reveal
average gifts in making alleged music in
unexpected ways. Their particular pride is
a xylophone which emits sparks when wal-
loped in the dark, while Alsace is the heavily
important inventor of an object which seems
to be the offspring of a fiddle and a cornet
and tries (unsuccessfully) to be both parents
ar their best. Aliss Lorraine is the more
attractive artist—qualified by a devotion to
the bagpipes. In other parts of the bill the
reappearance of the high-kicking Cassellis
and the Newman revuesical duo is noted
with faint applause.

The other Saturday night a dead man lay
in a Alelbourne street surrounded by an
awestruck crowd. The Billjims had bared
their heads and the women were sighing
audibly in the presence of the corpse. It
had fallen very dead, and it looked very
dead until the police came and dowsed
water on its marble brow. Then the corpse
began to babble of green fields and long
beers, and the police took it into custody
on a hand truck. Fined 40 shillings for
being “drunk and disorderly.” Not dead,
but disorderly!

“Irish Rifle” : Travelling by motor in the
wake of Yictoria’s picnicking Parliament-
arians through Gippsland I missed all the
fizenchicken, but got the gossip. And it
was all about one thing—the shocking waste
of good cash. At Nowa Nowa a dozen rail-
way navvies were taken off their job and
sent to Buchan to carry out the permanent
and reproductive work of putting up tents
for the junketeers. It took them a week,
and nothing would ever be known about
them if I hadn’t told Cohen where some of
his ducats go.
After a strike which lasted three weeks
and meant idleness for nearly 8000 men, the
workers who supply fuel to Ivalgoorlie mines
have gone back to practically the same pay
.and conditions that they have had for the
last five years. AA’hen the dispute first arose
the fuel companies offered certain conces-
sions or to submit the case to arbitration.
But the axemen would have the whole hog
and their own road. In the end they have
got only a fraction of what was first offered
them, and —worse still —they have con-
vinced some mine managers that it is now
better to use coal than wood. So far as it
will lead to the stoppage of deforesting the
strike was a good thing. But it will be a
mighty bad thing for the woodcutters, who
gained nothing, while £35,000 that ought to
have been earned and paid in wages was lost
in the hold-up.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Private Boxer”: The new J. and N.
Tait combination, which includes brother
E.J.. who after 10 years is leaving the Wil-
liamsOn firm, should shake things up in the
theatrical world, where a little shaking up
will do no harm. For one thing the present
generation of theatre-goers may thereby get
a chance of seeing what an English play is
like. The piece the Taits start with, “Peg
o’ My Heart,” although produced in the
U.S.A. first of all, is more British than
Yankee, for which the Lord make us truly
thankful. It was written by Hartley Manners,
whose name may be remembered by middle-
aged playgoers in Australia. Manners, who
nowadays .finds the pen mightier than the
greasepaint, was the long-haired, boyish-
looking mummer who played juvenile lead in
the English comedy company brought out by
Harry Rickards, which included Charles
Cartwright and his daughter, Styan, and
Beatrice Lamb. The portraits of this com-
petent crowd adorn the walls of the Mel-
bourne Tivoli.
“0.K.” : George Titheradge lived the best
four years of his Australian life under the
management of the original Williamson firm
—the AY., G. and M. triumvirate. He was a
man of only 30 when he first came to Aus-
tralia with Arthur Garner’s Co., and stayed
a year or so. He was 35 when the Trium-
virate imported him (in 1883) to play the
Silver King. After four years he joined the
Brough and Boucicault Co. to play Charles
Surface in “School for Scandal.” But he
had previously been associated with the
Broughs and Dion and Nina Boucicault
when they were playing under the Firm’s
banner. In fact, Titli. was one of the co.
that supported old Boucicault, the actor-
author, when he and his son and daughter
were imported for Irish drama purposes.
AVhen the giddy old man returned to Eng-
land, after bigamously marrying Louise
Thorndyke in Melbourne, his disgusted off-
spring stayed with the Firm. Then it was
that Tith. appeared with the B.’s and
B.’s in Pinero’s “The Magistrate” and other
comedies. Previously he did some good
work in melodrama other than “The Silver
King,” and after B. and B. had started
management on their own Tith. was still
with the Firm, playing juvenile lead in a
good farcical comedy that Alfred Alaltby
lmd the rights of. There must have been
at least two revivals of “Silver King”
within four years, though the drama had
scored a record run in the first instance.
AYriter remembers three different Nellie
Denvers playing to Titli.’s AYilfrid. The
first was Annie Mayor, who went to America
and stayed there. The next was Alaggie
Knight. Then came Isabel Morris, who was
the least comely but the strongest emotional
actress of the three.
“Ivaniva”: Newspaper obituaries all
wrongly say that Titheradge came to Aus-
tralia with the London Comedy Co. As
mentioned incidentally in Tiie Bulletin
lately, Titheradge appeared at the Academy
of Music (Melb.). May 24. 1879, as Lord
Arthur Chilton in “False Shame.” He
also appeared with other cos. during that
year. The London Comedy Co. opened at
the Opera House on June 21 following in
“Friends.” Not only had Titheradge played
a month before the London Comedy Co.
opened, but he did not appear with that
organisation till February 7, ’SO. That was
at the Opera House (Melb.), as Bob Gassit
in “Dearer than Life.” The -o. was then
running a return season, which lasted five
weeks. This was the extent of Titheradge’s
connection with that famous group of
actors, which, by the way, was controlled by
W. S. Lyster and Arthur Garner.
"Busker”: So “First Old Man” thinks
I'm too rough on the Actors’ Association
(B 27/l/’l6). Am IV A well-known
mummer of 20 years' experience with Ihe
best (and worst) dramatic shows in Aus-
tralia was. through no fault of his own,
hopelessly stranded and dangerously ill in
a North Queensland hospital, and his equally
well-known actress-wife was penniless at
the local pub for many weeks. Under these
untoward circumstances the A.A.A. was
asked not for charity but for a small loan.
The benevolent body turned down the appli-
cation and rubbed the refusal in with some
superfluous moral reflections on improvi-
dence. The man they deserted was one of
the three mummers who waited on the then
Minister for External Affairs, Josiah
Thomas, in the first effort to form an
Actors’ Union —the very union that the
short-sighted A. A. Ass. so strenuously
opposed and at whose funeral it so whole-
heartedly assisted.
“Bin Fiz” : Talk about carrying coals to
Newcastle! The American Kalem Cinema
Co. has filmed a photo-play adaptation of
“Stingaree,” a rattling good tale of the Aus-
tralian bush by E. AY. Hornung, who by the
way created “Raffles.” the amateur cracks-
man. After due deliberation the film co.
reckoned that the Stingaree stories would
make an absorbing film, chockful of inci-
dent that would appeal to the American,
and moreover give him a vivid impression
of the Australian bush and the customs of
this country. At first one enterprising-
director wanted to bring a co. over to N. S.
Wales so that real local color could be
obtained. But he was promptly squashed by
the producer, who stated that California
would do as well as “Sidney”—notice how
they spell it—and forthwith made all
arrangements for the actors to get busy.
The job completed, one of the first buyers
on the market was an Australian Film Com-
bine, which reckoned it good business to show
Australians an Australian story once in a
while per medium of the white screen, even
if it wasn’t made here. Truly, an object-
lesson that should be digested !
“110 IIo”: “Steele Rudd” is barking up
the wrong tree (B. 27/l/’l6) when he
accuses me of having said: “The big man-
agements know the pulse of their public
well enough to leave this sort of business
[‘On Our Selection’] to others.” If Dad
will look up The Bulletin. 30/12/’l5, he
will find that this statement was made by
my misguided opponent “Mid-Channel.” and
that I merely quoted it (B. 13/1/TG) to
deride the “simple faith” of one who could
cherish such a quaint notion. It is sad to
he so misunderstood, but I forgive “Steele
Rudd” freely and willingly and accept his
apology in advance, seeing that the facts set
forth by him go to prove my contention
that the big managements are to blame for
not staging Australian plays, and .that, in
view of the success of “On Our Selection,”
it is ridiculous for “Mid-Channel” or any-
one else to assert that local theatregoers are
Stinking Fishmongers.
“0.K.” : Hale Hamilton, the Yankee com-
edian, is credited with this perversion of
facts :
It may seem a strange thing to say, but it is a fact
that people are unwilling to laugh when they go to
a humorous play. They struggle against the desire
to laugh; they defy the comedians to make them
laugh. It is the same everywhere. That is what
makes the art of being humorous so extremely
difficult.
How these mummers magnify the difficul-
ties of their job ! The truth is that nobody
goes to see any sort of comedy, farcical or
otherwise, save with the idea of being
amused. Many people avoid sentimental
drama and tragedy because they regard the
theatre as a place to “larf” in. They guf-
faw when the funny man exclaims “Damn !”
as though the word were essentially amusing
They rock when he falls down stairs or
slips off a chair, neither of which feats
presents great artistic difficulties. Often
before the familiar “star” has appeared
on the stage the audience shrieks at the
sound of his voice behind the scene. If he
has any natural eccentricity of voice, fig-
ure, gait or feature most of them accept him
as funny and laugh accordingly. The more
his droll effects are produced without the
“art” that Hamilton talks of the louder they
laugh. It is only the polished, subtle
humorist who frequently misfires, because
80 per cent, of the audience may lack the
ouick intelligence necessary to see the joke.
No art of humor can so point a subtle jest
that it will at once penetrate the mental
hide of a fool. But the fool goes to the
theatre expressly to larf. Hence the success
of a red nose, red wig or baggy pants, fools
being very numerous.

proprietors to return the money to any pur-
chaser who is dissatisfied with the results
after the use of a full bottle. This new tonic

GOOD MISSIONER: “ Do you drink, my poor

DOSSER: “Why, suttenly, mum! Where

“Machete”: The Ivursaal here (Cairo) is
our respectable theatre, ranking with the
Tivoli, and it is the management's proud
boast that a soldier can take a lady there.
Those who are not ladies can go by them-
selves —and do. So far, thanks to the aver-
age female Briton’s ignorance of French
vernacular, the Kursaal’s boast has not been
seriously shaken, but a performing chim-
panzee has managed to flutter it. This beast,
whose name is Prince George, when show-
ing in Australia finished his turn by going
to bed decently, pulling the bedclothes up
and composing himself to slumber. In
Cairo his part demanded that he should
first open the door of a small cupboard and
remove a domestic utensil which it held.
On the opening night this .new business
ended in disaster. At the auspicious moment
the monkey was seized with stage fright and
frantically attempted to leave the stage,
carrying the hollow-ware, only to be met by
an enraged and cursing manager. He darted
from door to door and was blocked every-
where. By this time the house was hysteri-
cal. Respectable ladies and those who
wished to be considered so were jambing the
exits, while the rest just roared. Presently
the big brute attempted to storm the orches-
tra, but was repulsed. Then he went up
centre, planked his nightmare on the stage
upside down, and sat on it. with a
grimace, which left the remainder of his
audience weeping and helpless in sheer joy.
It was a great show and helped one to under-
stand why the respectable Briton is so fond
of holidaying in Cairo.

“Briner”: The Sorfa reren’s escape from
King Island, in Bass Strait, is a reminder
of 60 former disasters. The worst concerned
the Nera, Cataraqui and British Admiral.
The Nera was a convict ship with 500
women and hit the Navai’in reef. All hands
were lost. A few got ashore, only to die of
starvation. Many years afterwards a bush
fire _revealed 35 skeletons. The Cataraqui, in
1845, had 408 immigrantj and stuck in Fitz-
maurice Bay. Only nine survived. It was
the doctor’s fault. He prevailed on the
captain to take I'isks in order to. hurry a
few bad cases into Melbourne. The British
Admiral gave its name to Admiral Bay.
Every soul aboard was lost. Some would
have been saved but for mistaking a sand-
bank for the mainland, and the rising tide
swept them off. Now to these tragedies
we have added the comedy of a Norwegian
getting. off the island without assistance,
and quietly passing the rescue tug in the
bay. To the marooned mate who sent the
wireless message from the island it must
have seemed like a bad joke in a cemetery.

“Moana”: Gathering bog moss is an in-
dustry that has leapt ahead in England and
Ireland since war started. As a surgical
dressing it is about the best in existence, and
the demand for it in
the field hospitals in
France has been enor-
mous. Its value lies
in the millions of
minute tubes with
which it is permeated.
In the natural state
these hold water eight
or nine times the
weight of the plant,
so that when the stuff
is dry it is one of
the most absorbent
materials known. It
is very soft, light and
cool, and, as all the
preparation it needs is
to be sterilised and
placed in flannel bags,
it is a very economical
dressing. It was used
in English hospitals
for some time prior
to the war, but, as
usual, the whole of
the supplies were
drawn from Hog-
many. When the dis-
turbance started the
supply from that
quarter ceased, and as
harassed surgeons at
the Front were howl-
ing wildly for the
stuff, Mi's. Britannia
had to scramble round
amongst the bogs and
fells and collect it.
Of course the article
was growing there by
the ton, and a better-
sample than the im-
ported stuff, but no

industry as long as

the mother of cities; so any r eye-testing
chemist who qualifies for membership of the
Spectacle Makers’ Co. becomes, per se, a
freeman of London. It is an honor of senti-
ment only nowadays, conferring the right
to graze four ewes and a ram-goat on the
site of Nelson’s Column, or to fly hawks and
trap wyverns at St. Pancras or Westminster,
or something like that. Perhaps the privi-
lege of running a ram-goat on Trafalgar
Square is poor proof of Australian patri-
otism ; but it’s a quaint old custom, anyhow.

Victoria’s superfluous Excellency Stanley
had horrible luck the other day. Talking
loosely at an A.N.A. banquet, he indulged
iu the' usual superiah yelp at young Aus-
tralia’s lamentable lack of discipline; and
though nobody hissed at the time, Stanley
must have felt foolish when next morning,
after reading his own Sunday-school super-
intendent remarks in the Age, he found
Dr Springthorpe’s account of the way our
boys got out of Gallipoli, with this conclu-
sion : “So closed the Anzac episode. It was
magnificent. The outstanding feature is
perfect discipline. Perish for ever the idea
that the Australian cannot be and is not
disciplined.” So far his Ex. hasn’t inti-
mated that he is reconsidering his views.
He hasn’t even intimated that he is going
to the Front, or as near to it as he can get,
like Springthorpe did, to pick up some
first-hand information on his subject.

“Murkah”: Before Postmaster-General
Webster starts reaching out after palatini
buildings and the nationalisation of motor-

ot the urgent telegram. By paying double
rates swarms of people with race results

with love” and such non-urgent rubbish get
priority for their messages over telegrams
of genuine urgency. Nearly every day of
the week the telegraphed howl of Ikey
drowns poor old Bill’s message to Jim to
“Come quick mother dying.” The system
is good enough, but it ought to be restricted
to really urgent telegrams, though that per-
haps sounds like bad business to a depart-
ment which wasn’t sure whether it lost
£2,569,431 or £569,431 last financial year.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m not so young as once I was, I’ve not so much

not blind.
I well remember—ah, the times when we were young
and gay!—
The night I kissed Jemima in the pantry... .Never
mind 1
She was floury to the elbows, and her hair was all
awry;
Her bodice, open at the neck, looked undemurely
kind.
Oh, still my heart recalls with glee, as compensa-
tions fly,
The night I kissed Jemima in the pahtry... .Never
mind 1
She leaned against me smiling, but she sighed, “Oh,
Mister, don’t 1”
And her hands as there I hugged her made my coat
all white behind.
Shall I tell you all that happened—after all, I think
I won’t—
The night I kissed Jemima in the pantry... .Never
mind 1
But a fearsome shape descended, and a moral shadow
felL
We were driven out of Eden by a shrill and bitter
wind,
By reproaches that informed us we were on the road
to Hell,
The night I kissed Jemima in the pantry... .Never
mind 1
But we old ’uns who have fallen can’t be always
keeping Lent,
Or curse the juicy fruit of life as here we gnaw the
rind.

impenitent
We still may kiss Jemima in the pantry—Never

“0.K.”: Up to last week England had
experienced 21 Zeppelin raids (the 21st
being the most appalling), and now it is
interesting to remember some of the cheer-
ful balderdash that was talked when yet
there had been no raids at all. German
threats of what the Zeps. could and would
do were ridiculed. One sapient M.P. spoke
of the airmen who were ready to lose their
lives in Britain’s cause by driving their
little monoplanes right into the blown-out
bellies of the airships as soon as they ven-
tured over dear old London. And so forth.
Amidst all the talk of “defensive measures”
(which was falsified by the very first raid)
and the boasts of counter-exploits to come,
the voice of common-sense never made itself
heard. No demand for a British Zeppelin
fleet to fight the German Zeppelin fleet was
heard above the cackle. Months went on.
the raids went on, and still Britain was
content to stand and be bombed whenever
conditions were favorable. The Germans
went on building Zeps. and the British
authorities continued to treat their raids as
matters of “no military significance.” The
situation is humorous or serious to cynics
in England according to where they happen
to be when bombs drop. Given enough time
for the building and improving of Zeps. and
the manufacture of more and more deadly
explosives, the Germans will eventually re-
duce London to a city of ruins and human
remains. Every building worth mentioning
will have been bombed, and all the old in-
habitants will be dead or fled, and the matter
will still have “no military significance.”
Then Parliament will meet in some mys-
terious district that the Censor forbids "to
be mentioned, and the Official Press Bureau
will issue a War Office announcement con-
cerning the capture of half a German trench
on the Western Front, where military signi-
ficance has its headquarters.

DRESSMAKER: “Now, Mr. Waddler, will you have it gathered at the waist?”
“II.O.”: I have often been puzzled as to
who were “Esquires” in this country, but
lately a sort of official hint has come my
way. A week or two ago I received a
request, addressed to “Mr. H. 0.,” asking
me to enlist on behalf of the Empire. Then
the other day a circular arrived asking me
to have a bit in the Commonwealth War
Loan, and this was directed to “H. 0., Esq.”
From which I judge that when you have
blood to shed for Empire you are mister,
but when you have only cash you are merely
esquire.

Melbourne’s city streets are paved with
assorted wood-blocks from various parts of
Australia, chosefi for their immediate cheap-
ness. In order to make them last as long
as possible, the City Council periodically tars
and sands the road-surface. There is some-
thing peculiarly cussed in the Council’s
method, for on hot days it invariably finds
seme patching-up to do and the results are
vexation of spirit and grit on the grilled
chop. Still under any brand of municipal
franchise the citizens seem to have to suffer
something—if it isn’t tar it’s liable to be
Meagher.
At Geelong (Vic.), whence came Jacka, the
first Australian to win the V.C. in the present
war, there is a little-
advertised bunch of stay-
at-homes who are doing
good work. They call
themselves the National
Defence Association—
but no matter. What
does matter is the fact
that they have latterly
made things hum in the
way of providing facili-
ties for soldiers. They
started an entertainment pavilion
one Monday, and finished it with
their own hands by the following
Saturday evening—and there were
1500 men on the floor that night.
They have also been responsible
for a Soldiers’ Rest House and a
shelter for those who are mending,
and, in spite of false-teeth, knock-
knees and family responsibilities,
the N.D.A. is continually trying to
show that it can be a good soldier
in its own way. And succeeding.
Arthur Crichton, alderman in the Mel-
bourne City Council and chairman of the
market committee, has opened his heart to
the public in regard to the street-hawker.
There was a time when, with grapes at six-
pence a pound in the shops, the barrowmen
sold the same and better for tuppence. In
those days the banana-skin was frequent
upon the sidewalk and the shopkeeper cursed
bitterly with every other breath. By-and-
bye the truckmen were shifted across
Princes’ Bridge; next they were permitted
to rove up and down in a fugitive manner,
selling bagfuls of fruit as they roved ; after-
wards they were practically banished from
the city’s limits. Then the shopkeepers’
curses changed to blessings, and all was well,
except for the public, which found fruit
dear and scarce. Now the City Council has
decided on what looks like a sensible course:
fruit stands are to be built in various parts
of the city and let at reasonable rentals;
no able-bodied men will be considered when
the would-be holders are sorted out by the
council, while absolute preference will be
given to wounded soldiers. Should ' the
administrative stream remain unpolluted at
its source, this sounds like a good thing for
all parties except the shopkeeper; and when
one considers the present price of late
peaches in Melbourne it is difficult to spare
that shark much sympathy.
Anglicans in South Aus. have been feeling
that these piping times of war are altogether
too dull, so they have raised a little local
scrap to put a bit of excitement into life.
Some years ago Dr. Thomas, who wears the
gaiters in Adelaide, rounded up all the
committees which were circulating the hat
in his diocese for various missions, and
united them into one organisation, to save
conflicting appeals and wear and tear of
tile. This one body was to receive all the
cash collected ; but donors were at liberty to
earmark their contributions to be paid to
any special mission. The plan worked well
enough, but now a rival has arisen, known
as the Church Missionary Association.
Offers to recognise the C.M.A. as an agency
of the official organisation, with representa-
tion on its committee, were rejected, though
the proposal carried with it the right of the
C.M.A. t:o allocate all money it collected to
any object it pleased. Eventually, when
the C.M.A. started an opposition cadging
campaign, and took the wind out of the offi-
cial apron by getting in first with a “summer
school” which had been projected by the
Diocesan Association, Bishop Thomas felt it
was time to kick, and announced that the
official organisation alone bore the union
label, and that the rival body was a black-
leg. The whole trouble arises out of the
fact that the Anglican Church is two
churches at least, if not three. There is the
“•Low Church,” which loudly proclaims its
Protestanism; there is the “High Church”
variety, which shudders when the word
“Protestant” is mentioned ; and there is the
big majority of sleepy old Anglicans who
doze along the heavenward path, with only
an occasional crumble at the shindy the
other parties are raising. The C.M.A.
belongs to the “Low” school, which sees
Pones in its sleep, and won’t go to bed
with any mission that doesn’t suffer from
the same nightmares. Hence its refusal to
work with an official organisation which has
to steer a middle course and recognise all
schools equally. Meanwhile, the Bishop
says the C.M.A. is on strike, and the
C.M.A. says the Bishop has declared a lock-
out, and a really pretty fight is raging.
The steamer Devon, which has just
reached Australia on her maiden voyage
from Liverpool, is an infant with a history.
She was being built at Dunkirk (France)
when war broke out, and was towed out of
harbor to avoid risk of being taken by the
Germans when they seemed likely to break
through a year ago. The Devon displays
proudly in the chief saloon a chunk of a 17-
inch shell that burst near her just as she
was hurried out of the building yard in a
half-clad state.

goods do not reach the enemy. During 1915 the imports of American wheat to these countries more than doubled, the inerease being 30,000,000 bushels,
or 18,000,000 bushels more than Germany took from America in the previous year. The importations of maize by neutrals, under the agreements, also
doubled, the excess being 14,000,000 bushels, or three times the quantity imported by Germany during peace.-War News.

DONALD McLEOD, in the fob he worked
for —Chief Secretary in Peacock's Gov-
ernment (Vic.).
A Melbourne paper points out that George
Reid's success was inevitable. His progress
was certain because he had faith in himself.
So faith does move mountains!
Professor Jethro Brown, who is S. Aus-
tralian country-born, with a brilliant record
at five universities, has decided, after hesi-
tating a bit, to accept the presidency of his
State's Industrial Court. He has made a
special study of economics, and his experi-
ence as one-time head of the Commonwealth
Sugar Commission should be a help when
he becomes also chairman of the Prices
Regulation Committee of S. Aus. He is,
further, to boss the Court that will fix hotel
rentals under the new Licensing Act; and he
will be an acting-Judge whenever a fourth is
wanted. Altogether a heavy contract to be
taken on by a man, however brilliant, whose
experience has not lain much on the practical
or Court side of the law.
EXPERIMENTUM CRUCIS.
SHADE: “Whither now ?”
DIOGENES: “Off to search for an honest
neutral .”
The idea of the little military potentates
still seems to be to find reasons for shutting
out recruits. In Melbourne the other day
they barred George Kong Meng from active
service on the ground that he is “not sub-
stantially of European origin,” and thereby
put themselves in au awkward position, since
the volunteer's brother is a sergeant serving
with the First Australian Division. Old
man Kong Meng was a picturesque figure in
Melbourne years ago—an educated man who
spoke practicable quantities of several lan-
guages. He was a native of the Straits
Settlements and a British subject thereby.
His wife was a big. handsome Tasmanian;
but the offspring generally favored their
Penangese papa, which probably accounts for
the hasty action of the Town Hall ex-
aminer. The old fellow always wore the
clothes of his own country ; and on State
occasions he literally dressed in purple and
fine linen. George Kong Meng, the rejected
volunteer, was born in Victoria 30 years ago.
Old ex-Judge Boucaut, of South Aus.. did
not long survive his former colleague, Chief
Justice Way. Boucaut was perhaps a
greater politician than Judge. He held
almost every possible office in State Minis-
tries. Three times he was Premier —once
when the Chief Justiceship fell vacant, and
he gave it to Way. his Attorney-General,
who had been in politics less than a year.
This was in 1876; in 1878 he was content
to retire from the more strenuous field, and
accept a junior judgeship himself. In poli-
tics, 'which he played for 17 years, he de-
vised what he called a “broad and compre-
hensive” policy—railway north from Port
Augusta, rail to what is now the Broken
Hill district, opening up the Murray by im-
proving the mouth, and also by railway,
which he intended to go right through to
Wentworth (N.S.W.). And he proposed
taxation to meet every farthing of the inter-
est on the necessary borrowings—an idea
which in the ’7o’s was considered horribly
Radical and daring. As a Judge he was a
stickler for forms and ceremonies, and was
the terror of the Junior Bar. “Techni-
cality?” he once growled to a young lawyer,
who had made a slip and wanted to argue
that it did not matter. “There is no such
thing as a technicality. Hither it is the
Law or it isn’t.” He was a sound Judge,
though his quick intellect made him a shade
too ready to jump to a conclusion without
hearing the whole of the argument. When
he went on the Bench it was freely fore-
casted that its serene atmosphere would not
suit the warrior, and that presently he
would be back in the political arena again;
but he stuck to his job as long as his health
lasted. In private life he was a keen
yachtsman at his seaside home at Glenelg,
an enthusiastic supporter of the Arab horse
and a persistent Bulletin paragraphist.
But this paper could never induce the grim
old man to go beyond Aborisrinalities.
The Tasmanian Uni. has lost its first and
only 7 Registrar by the death of Lieutenant-
Colonel Cruickshank, R.E., who_passed out
at Hobart the other day, aged to. Alter a
good many years’ service in India he came
to Tasmania about the time the local IJnivei-
sity was started and got the job of Regis-
trar, which he had held ever since, though
for years past his lady assistant has done
most of the work.
One of the ancients of the N.S.W. Labor
movement celebrated his “golden wedding
the other day—Sydney Clyde Thornton a
boy of 78. who still takes his place proud y
in the Sydney Eight Hours Procession. He
narrowly missed being Australian-born. Ins
second name being that of the ship in which
lie sailed into this world. He was helping
to build the barn the S. M. Herald still
inhabits when the Stonemasons Union
secured the recognition of the Eight Hours
Day.
Alban Morley, the Liberal candidate
selected to run next time against Alfred
Ozanne, M.H.R. for Corio, is doomed to
another disappointment. This time he has
himself done the dooming, having patrioti-
cally written to the Corio branch of the
U.L.P. and withdrawn his candidature, in
view of Ozanne’s recent enlistment in the
A.I.F. Morley is a Melbourne barrister who
comes at rare intervals above the political
horizon —a faintly-luminous, half-mysterious
figure that bobs down again almost before the
public is aware of his appearance. His hobby
used to be giant hen-hounds. But his neigh-
bors prayed him to change it. _ So, being
always affable, he went in for politics.
The worry of the war is killing off old
men. Three venerable Victorians passed out
within a week recently. There was James
Thomas Donaldson, formerly of Kangaroo
Grounds, who died in Melbourne. Seventy-
five years ago he came to Victoria, as a kid of
eight, with his adventurous father, and his
stories of the blacks and the bushrangers
were full of personal interest and should
have been written up. T. W. Clark, an
octogenarian with 60 years of Melbourne
experience, was a local manufacturer in the
da vs when a factory was almost a profanity.
Afterwards he “took up with” the mining
flirt, and two of his sous became stock-
brokers. One of them is trying to be honest
on the London Stock Exchange. By compari-
son Angus McDonald, who died in the Cas-
terton (Vic.) district, was a youngster —only
70. He managed a station for John Grice long
ago, but forsook Victoria for S. Aus. and
squatted there. He was a good bit of a
sport, and what he didn’t know. about merino
sheep was not worth considering.
That Captain John Steven Cameron who
slipped his cable the other day in Maoriland
was one of the best-known men around the
coast in the long ago, and had material for
about 15 books stowed away in his memory.
One of his yarns about an escape out of
“PADDY” WEBB ,
member for Grey,
Maoriland.
Poverty Bay when
massacres were the
most frequent local
industries was as
hair-raising as any-
thing that comes
along from Billjim.
At one time he and
his brothers ran a
big lightering busi-
ness for the Shaw,
Savill Co. at the
lleathcote estuary
(near Christ-
church) and ac-
quired a diminu-
tive vessel called
the Mullough to
help them. There
isn’t anything re-
markable about the
Mullough now a-
days except her
age. But she was
the first steamer
built by Swan,
Hunter nnd Wig

Memories of Jhe Norton divorce case, in
which Eva Pannett figured, will be revived
by a down-south advt. announcing the
marriage of “Harold James MeClintoek of
Swansea Villa. Iviama, N.S.W.. to Eva,
daughter of Air. E. C. Pannett. of Stanley
Wallington. Surrey, England, and
niece of Mr. John Norton, of St. Helena.
Maroubra Bay, Sydney.” It happened at
St. David’s Cathedral. Hobart.
Dave McGrath, M.H.R. for Ballarat, has
been accepted for active service. Parker
Moloney, Federal member for Indi, has put
Yes on his card ; but the military medico lias
still to be heard from in his case. With
Hampson of Bendigo rejected as over age
and Ozanne of Corio passed, this makes
four Labor enlistments from the Reps, within
a week. So far Liberalism has done Its duty
nobly by giving pairs.
One of the most dramatic incidents in the
laW George Musgrove's career was the death
of Federici in his production of “Faust” at
thp Princess’s Theatre in Melbourne in the
’SO’s. Federici, after a telling performance
as Mephistopheles, fell dead 4s he made his
last exit with Faust through the trap-door.
M. P. CONSIDINE,
President Broken
Hill strikers.
He had known all
along that he had
heart disease, and
that it would finish
him some day. In
fact, in his anxiety
that night, as the
opera began, he de-
clared, “T will give a
fine performance, but
it will kill me”;
and the words
proved prophetic. At
the graveside, on the
Monday, the clergy-
man while reading
the burial service
fainted, also from
some heart trouble.
Musgrove, standing
next to him, glanced
round as he picked
up the book which
had fallen from the
parson’s hands, and
handed it to Charles
Warner, who read
the remainder of the
service.
G. J. R. Murray, S. A us. new C.J., backs
his position with a large purse. Born the
son of a wealthy squatter, he later became
heir to the large fortune left by his bachelor
uncle, John Tinline, of Maoriland. Murray’s
mother was Tinline’s only sister, and the
former left about £70,000. Murray is a
bachelor, too ; his affianced died when lie was
at college in England. Socially lie is a
recluse in his beautiful home at Magill, and
his hobby is the collection of a legal and
historical library, the largest in S. Aus.
The Commonwealth’s first call for a war
loan brought in about 11 millions, and the
second more than twice that amount. There
was only one application for a million the
first time; the second time there were five.
That show’s what a lead means, and the man
responsible for the lead in this case was
without a doubt John Garvan. John J. is
the son of James P., who was the foundir
of the Citizens’ Life Office and Treasurer
in a Dibbs Ministry of the late ’Bo’s. The
father had imagination added to the ordi-
nary qualities of the financier, and this
made him one of the first Protectionists and
Australian Nationalists in N. S. Wales
politics. The son has even more of it, and
in his case it led him to at once think in
big figures when a war loan was proposed.
The result was an application for a million
for his office the first time and for a million
and a quarter the second. John Garvan
is still a young man. born at Hill End
(N.S.W.). and vigorous outdoor sport is
likely to keep him young.
“Calamo,” of a bright star in the Inky
Way:—•
Grit seldom surpassed is that of young H. P.
Moorehead, formerly of the Argus staff, .who has
come back from the firing-line without his right leg
and his right arm, which he left behind him in Gal-
lipoli. “It is a privilege to have seen and to have
spoken to such a really brave man,” wrote Lieut.-
Gen. Birdwood, whose job in command of the Gallipoli
expcditionaries should have made him something of
an expert in assessing stoical bravery. The Victorian
district of the Australian Journalists’ Association
had Moorehead as its guest on a recent evening, and
handed him a cheque to which nearly every press-
man in Melbourne ha'd subscribed. Dave Maling, of
the Argus, choked in his speech and came near
breaking down; Jack Davidson” editor of the Herald,
to being obsessed by the tragedy of young
strength shattered; Maisie Maxwell, the Herald s
woman reporter, tense and earnest, made the speech
of the occasion—and through it all the cheeriest and
the brightest by far of the many assembled was Moore-
head himself. Sanguine and stoical, he said in re-
turning thanks that he “guessed it was his own
greediness that had ‘done him in, ” for he was going
for a dixie of tea when he got in the track of the
shell which maimed him. “But,” he said, “if I’d
.died six weeks ago, 1 would have been fully satisfied,
because of all the kindness shown to me, that my
life had been worth while.” So he is standing
up as best he can to face his fortune left-handed;
and few men now living can have beaten such a
glorious roll-call as was sounded by that dead right
hand of his.

It is not in the profits that war conditions
are reflected ; drought alone would probably
have pared 10 or 20 thousand a half-year
off the ordinary earnings. The balance-sheet
items show better what damage the German
crime has done :

Note, first, the increase in the deposits. This
is no doubt mainly the result of the trepida-
tion of investors, Having no inclination to
risk their money on their own judgment
even if Treasurer Higgs will let them, they
let their bank take the risk. But this bank,
at any rate, isn’t disposed to do any plung-
ing. On the contrary, notwithstanding that
it lias £2,293,000 more deposits than it had
a year ago. it has £BOB,OOO less out in
advances. The result is of course a tremen-
dous increase in liquid assets, so that now
they represent no less than 58 p.c. of all the
debts to the public as against 50 p.c. 12
months ago. But though this adds to the
already exceptional strength of the bank,
the money isn’t all idle; for the holding of
interest-hearing public securities is greater,
and no doubt will be greater still _ at the
end of the. current half-year, as this bank
took a million of the new war loan.
Partly for that reason there are good
prospects of the profits being well maintained
during the current year. Other factors are
operating in the same direction. The season
is good and accommodation rates are mostly
higher than they were fill very recently.
Some people question whether a bank is
justified at a time like this in putting up
rates, etc., so as to show larger profits.
However odious war profits are in a general
way, something has to be said on the other
side so far as banks are concerned. The
very fact that people _ are so nervous that
they are pouring their money into banks
shows that the future is very uncertain, and
that values of securities are liable to fall.
But no matter how much securities may fall,
banks are expected to pay back 20s. in the
£ to depositors; and they must therefore
cover themselves against the risk of making
bad advances. The bank that charges a
higher rate and doesn’t put the excess earn-
ings by to cover the bigger risks of the
moment is doing a wrong thing; but no
stones can be thrown at any bank which
charges more because of the uncertain
future, and puts the-excess earnings in _the
stocking to cover the heavier contingencies.

We’ll put it like that; but the figures in
the last line call for qualification. “It is
desirable, in view of the low prices ruling
for all classes of debenture and inscribed
stock securities, to make some compensating
provision,” and £5OOO is accordingly put in a
new nest. Then you turn over the leaf to
see what debentures and inscribed stock
this co. owns that it should be necessary
to put by £5OOO to counter-balance any
shrinkage in value; and you find that, apart
from the £lO,OOO of Vic. stock lodged with
the Treasurer —and there for good—and the
£2OOO of 41 p.c. war stock, the debentures and
inscribed stock held by the co. have a total
face value of £4BOO. Maybe then the put-
ting by of £5OOO is a subtle little joke of the
co.’s: but at any rate it brings the smile
on the right side of your face. Far better
for a co.. and especially a trustee co.. to
provide too much for contingencies than
too little. The T„ E. & A. has a very well-
defined policy in this respect. Once, years
and years ago, it struck quite unexpected
trouble —most Australian lawyers would pro-
bably still tell you that the Privy Council
was wrong—and it has never forgotten the
lesson. To make surety doubly sure is now
its plan. Hence, though it has a paid capi-
tal of £90,000 —an exceptional amount for a
trustee co. —and an uncalled capital of
£60,000. it aims at a reserve fund of
£100,(XX), and has already more than half
of it; and when it reaches £lOO,OOO it is
bound to see reasons why £150,000 would
be better. A co. like that, offering to the
public a service which is only beginning to
be appreciated, must command increasing
support. At December, 1900. the estates
in hand were valued at £6,326,344; to-day
they amount to £11,517,598. And even that
probably doesn’t tell the full extent of the
progress made in the period, because it may
be 20 years or more after a trustee co.
secui’es business before the client is consid-
erate enough to die and the co. begins to
get any benefit. No doubt it is quite pos-
sible for a trustee co. to wind up more old
business than it secures in new business;
but it is highly improbable in the case of a
vigorous office, working a field whose greater
area is still practically unbroken. And that
means that for all practical purposes the
future of a trustee co. like this is assured
for, say, 10 years ahead. Anyway the
revenue is assured. The outgoings depend,
of course, on the management.

Some of the shareholders began to wonder
whether it was worth while keeping the sign-
board up, and the directors were asked to
find out if the Commonwealth Bank was a
buyer. The directors’ reply is to put up the
dividend to 9 p.c., and the extra 1 p.c. may
be the necessary whiff of chloroform far
as some of the malcontents are concerned.
Ts it worth while going on? The capital
is £55,000 and the visible reserves £89,492,
so the earnings—averaging them at £9OOO a
year—are equal to about £5 3s. p-c. on the
shareholders’ funds. It is not, however, safe
to pay out the whole of the profit; and if
£l5OO a year is held back for contingencies
the £7500 a year left means only £4 7s. p.c.
on the funds. And that is less than the War
Loan would yield. But the investor must re-
member that he hasn’t always 41 p.c. war
loans to fly to. Further, though the £l5OO
a year ought to be put by, it depends on the
management whether it is lost or not. With
wise management and no national catas-
trophe the undivided £l5OO is just as good as
if it were put bn fixed deposit every year.
In five years nearly £ll,OOO has been thus
laid by, and the average profits have in-
creased by, say, £6OO a year—the result no
doubt, mainly of the investment of this addi-
tional reserve. It isn’t a fair thing, there-
fore, to base calculations on the dividends
actually received: an eye must also be given
to the foundation that has been laid, and is
still being laid, for steadily increasing divi-
dends. Whether it would pay the Ballarat
shareholders better to sell or to hold depends
of course on what they could get for the
whole turn-out; but if they could get only the
book-value of the assets they would be
making a poor bargain. What they need to
do is not to sell out, but to launch out. A
bank with £174,000 of its own funds and so
few deposits that it has only £306,000 of
advances can’t expect to make big profits
unless it accepts business with a lot of risk
in it.
The Bulletin hopes the Ballarat bank
won’t disappear, anyhow. It is the one bank
in Australia which has its head office outside
a capital city—unless you like to count in
the little National of Tasmania, with head-
quarters at Launceston. The Yankee plan
of little local banks has a lot to recommend
it. No doubt if the Fifth Grand National
Bank of Arizona needs to get in 100,000
dollars quickly it could do it with much less
fuss if it had 10 branches to call on, each
to quietly do its little bit, than if the one
office has to drag in the lot. On the other
hand, the little local bank has a habit of
barracking hard for the town and district
where it has its stand ; and Australian towns
outside the capitals need all the barracking
they can get.

This is another case in which the manage-
ment evidently reckons it a fair thing to
ask a trifle more for the accommodation it
offers. Twelve months ago there was
£144 343 out in advances or represented by
“other assets” (apart from the premises),
and the half-year’s revenue was £12,24;>,
equal to £8 10s. p.c. for the half-year. As
at December. 1015, the advances, etc., were
£147,254 and the revenue was £13,232, or an
almost exact 9 p.c. The extra for the
half-year can’t be grumbled at, in view of
the increased risks with regard to repay-
ments and the larger doubt as to the value
of pledges within the next year or two. l ie
extra profit shown for the past six months
compared with the corresponding fraction
of 1914 isn’t, however, wholly due to the
increased average rate of interest earned.
Exes, have shrunk from £7lll to £bUo4,
partly no doubt on account of the reduction
of borrowed money, which has been made
possible by the calling up of another ss. on
the last issue of 25,000 shares. The liabili-
ties are now down to £12,414; so that prac-
tically the co. is trading only on its own
capital. That reduces the shareholders’ risks,
of course. There seem to be quite enough in
a business of this sort even if it only uses
its own money; yet, no doubt because of
first-class management, and because the co. s
established reputation brings it the best of
the business offering in the Mont de Piete
class, the long record of the co. has been
singularly free from reverses.

Fine time Melbourne lias allowed this co. to
have! There was nothing to growl about
perhaps in the 10 p.c. dividend, because 10
p.c. is really much less than that
on account of the big amount paid
into the business as premiums on
shares. Nominally the paid share capital
is £957,210, but another £558,330 has been
received by the co. in premiums; so even the
present 13 p.c. really means less than
p.c. on the capital actually put into the
business by shareholders. But note the enor-
mous profit which has been made of recent
years in excess of the amount distributed.
Until quite recently, though the co. was
extending its works in all directions, the
whole cost wms for years paid out of this
undivided profit. The following table
show’s the result: —
1905. 1915.
Total outlay charged to capital £2,171,745 £2,422,540
Total revenue .. .. 189,750 410,186
Revenue p.c. of capital outlay 8.7 j).c. 17.7 p.c.
In other words, the shareholders have put
up only £250,000 in 10 years in order to get
an extra revenue of £210,000 in the half-year.
That gives some idea of w’hat must have been
provided out of surplus profir. And this expen-
diture is in addition to all that has been
spent on ordinary maintenance and renewals.
I.ast half-year, for instance, besides the
£28,574 of profit devoted to the extension
and improvement of plant, no less than
£54,085 was spent on repairs and mainten-
ance of plant and distributing services, and
another £lO,OOO or thereabouts on meters
and stoves. Altogether this is something more
than a fair thing ; it is a big Private Enter-
prise making it infernally hard for a han-
dled smaller private enterprises to live. So
far the co. has been able to beat off legis-
lative restrictions; but the investor who
can’t see them coming is letting his faith get
in the way of his eyes.
The co. should have had its claws blunted
long ago by the City Council’s electric
undertaking; but the control of that concern
fell into the hands of people who, allegedly
in the interests of Private Enterprise, re-
fused to do one of the best services anybody
possibly could do to private enterprise—-
viz., give it a cheap light and powder supply.
After a strenuous fight a small improvement
is now threatened. Melbourne City Council
having at last decided, on the motion of
Charles Atkins, to introduce the system of
hire purchase of electric installation and
fittings. Thereby more ratepayers will
be induced to buy light from the
municipal factory instead of from the
Gas Co. This proposal w T as only
adopted by 16 votes to 12 after some
of the old, traitorous Tories had done
their worst. One of them said the Council
was “creating a huge and unnecessary trad-
ing concern.” as though a larger demand for
its electric light was the one thing it ought
not to create, and creation of anything w r ere
a dangerously progressive policy. And an
Alderman Jeffries, with profound ignorance
of his subject, said: “The Council is asked
to pass something that will grossly interfere
with private enterprise. This serious com-
petition with people in business is cruel in
the extreme” —a w’ail which is worth special
notice as evidence of how’ Melbourne is mis-
governed.

A nice, comfortable old business this, which
apparently doesn’t give anybody much con-
cern. Capital is £20.000 and reserves
£19,401. Allow only 3J p.c. on an invest-
ment of £37,000. and the co. has £1295 pet-
annum in interest. That leaves approxi-
mately £l7OO profit to come from the busi-
ness, which means almost exactly Is. 9d.
p.c. on the value of the estates in hand
(£1,986,352). Thus, though a profit of 15
or 16 p.c. on the share capital laoks very
glittering, it really isn’t much of a net pay-
ment for valuable services when spread over
the estates under administration. Of course
Is. 9d. p.c. isn’t the full charge; another
4s. 9d. or thereabouts goes in expenses.
In return for that less than J p.c. p.a.
the client gets his affairs attended to by
people who make it their one business in
life, and whose good and proper behavior is
guaranteed not only by the fact that their
living depends on it, but also by nearly
£40,000 in cash and gilt-edged securities,
£lO,OOO of which is held by the Treasurer as
a sort of bail-money.

The £28,000 mentioned in the last line as
written off is an amount transferred to a
contingency account, which previously stood
at £105,000. This is not included with the
reserves in the table. There was also writ-
ten off £33.473 against depreciation ; in the
preceding year, £35,994. If you like you can
add these latter amounts both to the profits
and to the amounts wu-itten off. It doesn't
matter; the net result is the same.
The co. was formed originally to work the
ore-treatment process of E. A. Ashcroft, an
electrical expert, and the Broken Hill Cen-
tral mine was bought to supply the material.
The process, installed at Cockle Creek
(N.S.W.), failed, but the mine turned out
trumps. The co., with headquarters in Eng-
land, surrounded itself with a very com-
petent staff; nevertheless the struggle out of
the morass was long and strenuous —-and
longer and more strenuous because-of serious
movements in the mine. No Broken Hill
Co., not even the B. H. Prop., has been more
ambitious or energetic. It tried for years
to establish the spelter (metallic zinc) busi-
ness at Newcastle, and that cost a lot of
money, too. Moreover, it refused to accept
that reverse as the last word on the subject.
It never did like Britain’s dependence on
Continental zinc smelters ; wherefore it pro-
moted the Central Zinc Co., and guaranteed
it a 5 p.c. dividend for 10 years. The works
were built at Seaton Carew, in England, and
so little success have they had that this co.
has had to pay the dividend regularly out of
its own profits.
War prices have toned up the past year s
profits, and made them leap high above those
of the preceding 12 months. Average prices
foi the past four years have been: —
1912. 1913. 1914. 1915.
Lead .. £l5 11 3 £lB 8 5 £lB 17 8 £l9 17 5
Silver . . 2 4 2 6* 2 5 2 1*
Zinc . . 26 4 9 25 910 ' 21 2 6 40 8 5
The output was 37.904 tons of lead concen-
trates, averaging (for all except a small
output from the slimes plant) 340 z. silver
and 64 p.c. lead, and 63.440 tons zinc con-
centrates, averaging (with the same qualifi-
cation) 16oz. silver and 46 p.c. zinc. The
lead concentrates were apparently all
smelted at the co.’s Cockle Creek works,
which also did a trade in purchased ore;
“new markets’’ were found for “a substantial
part of the zinc product.” The quantity
taken by the works of the offshoot co. in
England was still inconsiderable. As a mat-
ter of fact, when the war started and the
foreign workmen left, those w-orks had to
partly close dow-n. It has been the same all
through the piece—J. C. Moulden, the Aus-
tralian manager, has found it impossible to
get the English v T orkmen to stick to this
job. They want something easier.
The co. mined 200,079 tons of ore in the
year, and there are now 7 , according to esti-
mates, 2,039.200 tons in reserve, with a fine
lode going down below the bottom working
level (1300 ft.). The net profit last year was
about 255. per ton, and for years past it has
averaged over 20s. But this does not all
come from the mine. The Cockle Creek
works presumably don’t smelt 25 or 30
thousand tons of purchased ore a year for
the mere fun of the thing. Further, there
is now 7 the superphosphate plant, which last
year produced 12.994 tons, as against 10,0- 1
tons in the previous year, and is being far-
ther enlarged ; and, on a smaller scale, there
is the production of sulphate of ammonia
from the producer-gas plant. Finally, m

ROYDS, LTD., Investors’ Advisers, Challis House, Sydney
addition to the mine and the various plants,
there is the following surplus of liquid
assets: —
1908. 1913. 1914. 1915.
liabilities .. £279,373 £118,006 £89,843 £179,670
Liquid assets 258,987 502,505 439,591 720,620
Deficit •• £20,386 -
Surplus .. £384,499 £349,748 £540,950
That surplus (as at June 30) was pretty
deeply cut into by the dividends of £192,500
since paid—actually in July, 1915, and
Dec., 1915- But profits during the past six
months must ' have far more than counter-
balanced the dividends paid. There are 550,000
pref. shares of £1 and 550,000 ordinaries
reduced from £1 to 15s.
* * * *
England is an uncomfortable place to
send cash nowadays to have it cut up into
dividends. The income tax rate in Maori-
land being only about half what John Bull
is demanding, several companies that really
earn their money in the Ricketty Isles are
preparing to move their head offices to
the place where the profits are earned. The
first to do so is Talisman Consolidated, one
of the biggest gold-seeking concerns in
Maoriland. As an English company it is
about to go into liquidation and is shortly
going to blossom into a M.L. co. The men
who have controlled affairs in The Smoke
are evidently coming to the sane conclusion
that there are some good points about the
“colonies,” after all. Still, the last word
hasn’t yet been heard about taxation, even
in the “colonies.”
* * * *
Ardlethan (N.S.W.) is bubbling with
excitement over a rumor that one co. pro-
poses to replace the men w T ho have gone to
the Front with Chinese labor. If such a
contemptible thing is done something sud-
den should happen. The law can act, no
doubt —to the extent of giving the manager
a few years’ gaol for doing something very
seriously calculated to prejudice recruiting.
Decent patriots can do other things. For
a start, of course, the Exchanges will wipe
the stock off their list. Further informa-
tion on the subject is expected; meantime
the manager who has this bee in his bonnet
may as well consider whether his brilliant
scheme is worth while.
* * * *
The partly State-owned Cobar copper
(N.S.W.) has resumed smelting; one fur-
nace is in blast and the second will be at
work as soon as men are available. Unless
there has been material alteration in the
plan of operations proposed some time ago,
there is likely to be a serious conflict be-
tween Treasurer Holman, representing the
State proprietorship, and the Mines Depart-
ment, which is the authority responsible for
the administration of the Mines Regulation
Act. Throughout the mine pillars of valu-
able ore have been left to help keep the work-
ings open. The proposal was to take out these
pillars and otherwise gut the mine of the
richest ore. The mines inspectors strenu-
ously opposed this plan, urging that it
would lead to such a collapse of the work-
ings that it would be impossible to rework
the mine except at the cost of a new shaft
and removal of a large section of the plant.
Whether these officials are to be over-ruled,
as were other officials who protested against
the debentures purchase on practical and
financial grounds, remains to be seen.
* * * *
Cope’s Creek Central (N.S.W.), which
has been a nice little money-spinner for a
Melbourne crowd that rarely has the bailiff
in, had worse luck than usual last half-year,
and showed a working account loss of £775,
brought up to £1195 w 7 hen other items are
included. It was all through No. 2 plant
(Skeleton Creek) getting into poor ground.
Probably the lead splits and they fell into
the fork. There are certainly better things
to be had, and from this out the co. will
have three plants giving shareholders a run
for their money.
* * * *
A belated report on the geology of the
Ardlethan field by J. R. Godfrey, Inspector
ot Mines, gives shareholders in the Car-
pathia this to hope for and fear : “The mine
is undoubtedly a good one and will continue
for some time to produce a considerable
tonnage of payable ore; but being essentially
a series of pipe deposits they must be ex-
pected to sooner or later cut out abruptly
against the granite.”
* * * *
Birthday Tunnel, Berringa (Vic.), wins
easily in the competition for cheap work in
the Eastern States. On 4dwt. dirt it has
paid £68,000 in divs. out of £310.000 gold
won, and is still going strong to get a second
lease of life out of ground to the south.
Mine wages have run to £170,000 and con-
tracts to £14,000, two groups of figures that
will be reversed when the new piece-work
system resolved out of Justice Powers’s de-
cision is in force. The co. got on the call
list owing to No. 2 shaft having to be taken
down from 370 ft. to 540 ft. Here two lodes
Iv, 1 t?. t es ted, the Kangaroo on the east and
the Birthday Tunnel to the west. Both
nave yielded well to the north, and manager
Hansen expects to pick up something good
in the mine in the next few months when
driving south. The trouble in the district
is the frequent faulting of the reefs. They
prevent long shoots, but rich patches have
evened up the poor stuff,
* * * *
Instead of a note of doubt about A 1
Gaffneys (Vic.) there should be songs of
thanksgiving that the mine can stand its
charges and yet pay Bs. a share in the last
half-year. All that the Board says about the
future is that “returns appear assured,” just
as if Edward Miller (chairman) was giving
a tip about one of his dead-cert, steeple-
chasers. Gold got from 4657 tons is 53270 z.
and costs (including repairs) 225. 3d. per
ton. Development took another Bs. 3d., and
income-tax and administration 7s. per ton,
so the lot came to about 375. 6d.
The co. did not have a bank of rich stuff to
sw r ell up reserves as in the June half-year.
There was whispering of some finds of good
ore in unexpected spots, but on this there
is silence, so the rumor was probably a lie.
John Till, manager, doesn’t attempt to fill
up the gap about reserves. This may be
because he isn’t sure of the extent of the
170 ft. and 250 ft. floors he has been drilling
into below the adit at No. 8 level. Still
with stuff running from £5 to 70s. in floors
in No. 8 dowm to No. 11, he ought to be able
to account for a lot. A new battery is going
up, to be served from a new tunnel, and low-
grade stuff left in the upper floors will thus
be brought to market. Then the long-looked-
for highwater mark for shares may be
reached, despite the shrewd tongues that
murmur that the ways of the mountains are
the ways of the mist.
* * * *
Nell Gw r ynne, slamming the door on its
old home on the Goldfield line of reef, Ben-
digo, is taking up quarters under the roof of
the South Golden Fleece. This covers 1200 ft.
on the Comet, Stafford and Fleece side-lines.
Nell Gwynne came to a dead-end on its old
claim, and the wise men of its Board think
it better to use the plant to open up an
undeveloped mine than to let it rust or the
machinery man scoop bargains out of a re-
sale. Nell’s Co. has a register of 28,000
shares, and the South Golden Fleece 18,000.
Fusion takes place on the lines of the
Gwynne folk getting share for share. A call
of 3d. is to be made on the South Golden
Fleece, and then the Fleece shareholders
accept one share in the new co. for two in
the old. Plants will be pooled, and the debts
of the South Golden Fleece will be paid off.
Seeing that the New Golden Fleece, north of
the South mine, looks like getting a run of
divs. out of its big formation, the change of
home for Nell Gwynne is good. It certainly
will bring a solid body of callpayers into a
neglected end of Bendigo.
* * * *
Melbourne is getting uneasy over the
Anzac (W.A.). At the time of flotation
there w r ere thousands of tons of 2oz. ore in
sight, and on the strength of this and other
gaudy statements the thing went off in a
few hours. Since then the underground
manager of one of the big Kalgoorlie mines
has inspected and reported that there are
less than 50 tons of 50s. ore above the No.
1 level and only a few hundred tons of ore
of that grade visible in the mine altogether.
A third man has been sent along to say
which of them wants the attention of an
oculist.
* * # *
Randalls (W.A.) is looking very sick.
The Santa Claus is in the hands of tributors,
the Lady Agnes and Hardcastle are being
worked in a half-hearted fashion, and almost
everything else in the vicinity is down and
out. When the place was boomed by a few
interested persons two years ago the Gov-
ernment astonished most people who knew
something about the past failures- of the
field by spending £5OOO on a water scheme.
So far the Santa Claus is the only mine
that has used the water, and the State has
Buckley’s chance of ever getting back a
penny of its outlay on the work.
* * * *
From Westonia :—•
As the recent depressed bore in the Edna Deeps
was not drilled square with the laminations of the
country, but at an angle thereto, some remarks made
by Dick Hamilton, of the Great Boulder, to the.
Institute of Australian Mining Engineers in 1909
on the subject of diamond-drilling should be inter-
esting. “Bores that are square with the lamina-
tions of the country are,” he said, “the most reli-
able. Those that are bored at a depressed angle
but not square with the bearing and dip of the lami-
nations, as well as those that are bored horizontally
but at an acute angle with the laminations, have a
great tendency to become square with the dip and
bearing of the laminations. Many instances on this
[Kalgoorlie] field can be given, all showing the
tendency of the drill to get square with the bearing
and dip of the country.” Hamilton ought to know
something about the subject. He has done miles of
boring, and his experience suggests, in a most un-
pleasant way, that the Deeps bore may have turned
into Edna May ground. I know that Macartney,
Duff and Stuckey say that the bore did no such
thing, but kept an unerring course in Deeps
ground. It may have done so; but as no one has
yet been down the bore to investigate, it is as yet
impossible to say where it finally drifted. If the
bore ended in Deeps ground it certainly behaved
differently to similar bores drilled in the Great
Boulder, Ivanhoe and Associated mines.
* ♦ * *
There hasn’t been much crowing over the
striking of the reef by the Edna May
(W.A.) at 300 ft. Even the shortening of
the distance to the stone from 138 ft. (as
per the. bore) to 120 ft. in the crosscut, with
successive bulletins of 30s. stone in the face,
hasn’t brought the expected movement in
the market. The truth is that the cream
was skimmed off when the diamond drill
told its tale, and the average holder isn’t
wrestling with the problem of how to raise
the wind to add to his holding. More are
interested in the way to do a gentle flit while
prices are high. Besides, if people want a
gamble, there is a better one to be had in
the side shows. Centrals have supplied most
of the fun since Frank Savage got back
to the Eastern States from Westonia, though
there are cruel souls who say that the 18ft.
formation and the sdwt. yield have a lot
more to do with the tune now set than any-
thing he could say or write. By contrast
Deeps is the laggard of the field, for even
the news that it is costing £25 a foot to
put down the shaft doesn’t bring in either
the plunger or the bear.
» * * *
There has been a sharp rise in Wallaroo
and Moonta shares, consequent on a rumor
that the next div. will be ss. The old mine
is very well managed, even though it never
does tell its reserves. To-morrow has always
been an important consideration with the
controlling powers, and this policy of being
ready . for any emergency—favorable or
otherwise—put the company in a position
to take full advantage of the high copper
market. On the sliding-scale system of fix-
ing wages according to copper values, em-
ployees will be participators in the war-in-
flated values. The peaceful working of this
system, which has had a long trial, is a
striking object-lesson for all industrial enter-
prise in Australia.
* * * *
I’ernatty (S.A.) copper controllers must
be looking forward to a speedy realisation
of the high hopes on which the flotation was
made. Anyway, they are issuing £6OOO
worth of 10 p.c. debentures with a currency
of only 18 months. These are to be a first
charge on the assets, but may be converted
into shares at 10s. each at the option of
holders. Debenture issues are always to be
sniffed at. Sometimes they are all right;
often they are a take-down. An important
case bearing on tbe legality of one issue is
likely to engage the attention of the courts
shortly. The vendor shareholders in a mine
which w*as sold on what seemed highly ad-
vantageous terms were shocked on being
informed that there w r as nothing for them,
all the assets having been absorbed by
debenture-holders. The allegation is that,
instead of paying calls as they had agreed
to do, the directors and others advanced the
money on debentures. The disclosures which
are threatened will be—well, interesting!
* * * *
The Cloncurry (N.Q.) miner has got an
industrial award reducing the week’s work
from 48 to 44 hours, and the minimum wage
has been lifted from 11s. to 13s. per day of
eight hours. Under the old rate six full
shifts at 11s. gave 665. per week as a mini-
mum ; under the new award wages are
to be 13s. per day, but although the worker
nominally gets a rise of 2s. per day, he
really only benefits to the extent of ss. 6d.
per week (six shifts at 11s. = 665.; 5J shifts
at 13s. = 71s. 6d.). On the 48-hour basis
the same rise in wages would give 12s. a
week extra. Let’s have high wages, by all
means; but an award that entails a reduced
output of copper is dead against the national
interest. Curtailing the output of metals
is of no use to the working man, for in the
end it spells unemployment.
* * * *
There is a big deposit of oxide of man-
ganese at the Dial Range, near Penguin
(Tas.). Years ago bulk samples were taken
and sent to England, where they gave a sat-
isfactory yield of manganese. At that time
the price of the metal was not high enough
to pay for working; but owing to the demand
for manganese for munitions the-price has
since more than doubled, and preparations
are being made for working the deposit.
There are thousands of tons of ore that can
be broken out very cheaply—some estimates
put it at 2s. 6d. per ton.
* * * *
“Dalriada” : “Fossils from Gallipoli” is a
recent newspaper heading. It has nothing
to do with aged generals who have been
Stellenbosched, as the S’African phrase
w r ent. The item relates to shells —fossil
shells which were in active service aeons
before the Australians. They were collected
by a soldier with a geological turn, Corporal
A. M. Sullivan, and forwarded by him to C.
Fenner, Science Principal of the Ballarat
School of Mines. They include several gas-
tropods, which belong to the late afternoon
of the geological day as we know it, and are
enclosed in yellowish mudstone. That the
Australian soldier should scientise under fire
is nothing uncommon —more than one of him
has sent botanical specimens home from Gal-
lipoli, and another ardent soul secured a
dish of mining specimens under fire, and
said it wms just his luck when a shell-blast
took a turn at assaying and blew the whole
outfit from his hands.
* * * *
Australian gas cos. have recently been
doing very well by the manufacture and sale
of residuals, and now metal cos. that own
their own coke ovens or producer-gas plants
are saving one of the most valuable residual
products—sulphate of ammonia. This,
besides being useful in chemical industries, is
a good fertiliser, and is highly esteemed on
the Java sugar plantations. The Sulphide
Corporation produced 619 tons of sulphate of
ammonia last year, and at the new works at
Newcastle the B. H. Prop, proposes to pay
more attention to residuals than Australia
has ever done hitherto.

DYSPEPTICS SHOULD AVOID
DRUGS AND MEDICINES.
TRY A LITTLE MAGNESIA INSTEAD.
Some people instinctively shut their eyes
to danger, and it may be that instinct, or
custom, or habit causes dyspeptics to take
drugs, patent foods and medicines, artificial
digestants, etc. But closing the eyes does
not banish the danger, and it is certain that
neither drugs nor medicines possess the
power to destroy the acid in the stomach,
which is the underlying cause of most forms
of indigestion and dyspepsia. They may
give temporary relief, but ever-increasing
quantities must be taken, and all the time
the acid remains as dangerous as ever. Phy-
sicians know this, and that is why the usual
advice now given to sufferers from digestive
and stomach trouble is, “Just get some
bisurated magnesia from your chemist and
take half a teaspoonful in a little w r ater
immediately after every meal. This will
instantly neutralise the acid and stop food
fermentation, thus enabling you to enjoy
hearty meals without; experiencing the least
pain or unpleasantness afterwards.” — Advt.

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney. February 7, 191(5.
My Dear Arini. —
Governor Strickland is more keen about
aviation —perhaps because it’s connected
with machinery—than he is about any other
outdoor sport. Riding, of course, excepted.
He went to have a look at the fiat country
round the Windsor district the other day
with young Geoff. Hughes at his heels. The
Sydney youth has now got his pass-
ports and leaves for England in March
to learn the aviation business in
Britain, Victoria’s academy being too
small for the number of local aspirants.
But there are prospects of better things, as
Sydney Uni. is to co-operate with our Gov-
ernment in a similar venture.
“Father” Maxwell, the recently-deceased
Superior-General of the “Cowley Fathers”
—one of the oldest and best known of the
Orders of monks which the “Catholic” move-
ment in the Anglican Church produced last
century —w T as a brother of Captain Everard
Maxwell, a British naval man stationed here
some 30 years ago. The captain, who took
part in the annexation of British New
Guinea, married a daughter of George
Wigram Allen, in those days Speaker of the
Assembly. Dr. Deeper, for 40 years head
of the Anglican college at Melbourne Uni.,
married another daughter. Boyce Allen, of
Sydney, represented the family at the funeral
of the deceased monk at Oxford (Eng.).
There was a long procession of St.
Andrew’s male choir, municipal splendor,
boy scouts, veterans and banners from the
Cathedral to Macquarie Place on Sunday
afternoon. Some of the choir, unable to
brave the fierce sun bareheaded, was straw
hatted. One ingenious youth knotted a
handkerchief over his topknot. On the edge
of the sward boy scouts, armed with broom-
sticks, made a wobbling line of defence
against the pressure of the crowd. A band
blared forth to fortify the unofficial song-
sters in the throng. If the early chroni-
clers can be trusted, Parson Johnson held
the fii'st service in Australia near the
present Macquarie Place garden plot on
Feb. 3, 1788.
Lord Mayor Meagher’s streaming coun-
tenance testified either to his own soft con-
dition or to the heat of the municinal rabbit-
skin on a summer afternoon. Town Clerk
Nesbitt, under the corkscrew curls of his
wig of office, looked quite warm enough, too.
Archbishop Wright sweltered in the full-
dress millinei’y that covers the ecclesiastic’s
mere trousers. On his head was a saucy
mauve-velvet Tam o’Shanter. Bishop Rad-
ford, of Goulburn, was also in his best mil-
linery, and, like the Methodist oarson Wood-
house and St. Mark’s (Darling Point) cleric
Lea, climbed on to a table to address the
multitude. The long, lean ascetic Lea gave
the best address—at which the congregation
said “Hear. hear” frequently. Parson
Lea’s dramatic appeal to “my Lord Mayor”
to censor the things that trouble the clerical
conscience was the fireworks of the occasion.
Sweden’s Consul Von Goes, assisted by
his good-looking missus, gave an afternoon
to welcome Miss Lilianne Lore. The Bel-
gian singer, who “obliged the company,” is
an attractive young woman with dark eyes
and a handsome mouth full of white teeth.
As a songbird, she was at a disadvantage in
a small room packed with visitors. Some
of the latter, evidently believing Mrs. Von
Goes to be of foreign distraction, invari-
ably addressed her in slow staccato tones.
Accompanist Archie Ranclaud, whose socks
(they made a ghostly patch of white silk
under the gi’and piano) are always a special
item at society gatherings, was a useful man
about the drawing-room. A sprinkle of other
male flotsam, left over to us from the war,
sauntered languidly round the teacups.
Mrs. Harry Finn, the handsome Mrs. Bart-
lett, Consuls Chayet and Shimizu—the lat-
ter with his little Jap lady—and Mrs.
Braham, wife of the D.T.’s chief, were in-
cluded in the cimsh.
So the Captain Wilson, M.P., now interned
in Vienna, was not our old acquaintance
Leslie, after all. The latter, who also
writes M.P. to his name, was a captain in
the Marines when he stood behind Governor
Rawson’s chair.
For months it has been said that George
Vivers, the tall King’s Plains squatter, was
likely to get into khaki. Now it is announced
that he goes to England to get measured.
Perhaps there’s some good reason behind it.
But Australia wants her sons to join hands
here. Mrs. George used -to be the lovely
Irene Marks. The loveliness, I hasten to
add, is still in its old place.
Sydney’s great surgeon McCormick is
expected home this week. The conquering
Alexander, back from the Front, may, an
he will, tell us if it’s true that he had
measles to look after instead of surgical
cases.
Major Verney, back to his old chnf, is on
Lord Chelmsford’s staff in India. While he
was aideing in N. S. Wales he married Nita
Walker and got some of the affluence that
flows to the relatives of the Yaralla mil-
lionairess. The Walker twins (brothers to
Mrs. Nita Verney) have not yet personally
annihilated the foe. There is plenty of
time, of course, and Wilhelm may one day
tremble before the Walker socks and war
cry. Brother-in-law Verney has done his bit
at the Front and got the usual bullet.
When he first came here he was an agreeable
young Englishman of small means and nicely-
trained drawing-room habits; but unfortu-
nately he became obsessed with the Great-
ness of Lord Chelmsford and contracted
some of his exemplar’s twopenny-ha’penni-
ness.
The Octagon Convalescent Home at Dar-
ling Point (once the Holts’ residence) is one
f the best of the rest houses for our wounded.
Graythwaite—the gift of fine old Tom Dibbs
—is another peaceful eyrie. The latter is
now about to have its doors officially opened.
The N.S.W. Red Cross Society, which flings
its feelers all over the State, has great hopes
that some of the stiff limbs in its care may
relax in the Moree artesian waters. Anyway,
in spite of the climbing thermometer there-
abouts, damaged Kangaroos are to be given
a chance to test the cure very soon.
The frisky damsels who kicked up their
satin shoes in the “Revue” a while ago
repeat their performance this week. A
fashionable hotel at Manly, where our Best
People frock in ballgowns to eat their din-
ner, houses the event. The results go into
the patriotic hat.
Golden-haired charmer Mrs. Roderick
Cameron is still distracting the male
emotions at Manly. The young widow,
who used to be Enid Lindeman, has
a small child to toddle after her raven
drapery. Mamma is obliged to spend a cer-
tain amount of time in N’York, according to
her late husband’s will. Also, unless Rumor
is a brazen Sapphira. some <ff Roderick’s
wealth goes elsewhere if his pretty relict
makes a second choice.
Oswald Watt, writing to a Sydney pal,
says he was then flving about Flanders, in
a temperature somewhere below zero. In
spite of the cold. Watt claims that Man
only finds himself when he gets artificial
wings. It is the most exhilarating sport in
the world, and, in spite of the risks, the only
life worth living. The daring Oswald reports
himself “as fit as a fiddle.”
Everybody is doing the finest work in this
war. In Australia next-to-nothing is heard
of the Italian campaign; yet an English-
woman, long resident in the north f Italy,
sends to a mutual friend in Sydney a letter
in which it is taken for granted that the
world knows that nobody else has done any-
thing to compare with the Italian artillery—
though even there they ha ve heard of the
Anzacs, thank goodness. Says she :
All the Allies, big and little, are splendid, stead-
fast, self-sacrificing—Belgium, Servia, France, Russia,
Italy, England, Montenegro; it is no question of
exalting one at the expense of the other. But the
Italian war is absolutely without parallel in history,
for the terrible nature of the obstacles to be over-
come. Look at these mountains, and see the height
of them
and she sends pictures with snow from the
knees up.
Up these mountains, all over the Trentino, about
the Isonzo, wherever the war is raging, it has been
a question ot' taking heavy siege artillery up where
never a wheel has come since the world was made —
making a path along these awful precipices, dragging
up the guns by hand where even mules cannot
go. The men are living up amongst the snows, and
working the guns, and when the moment arrives
taking the Austrian positions by assault; climbing
up smooth, perpendicular rocks, barefooted, to make
no noise. It sounds incredible when one reads of
it; and yet it all happens all the time. And the
troops must stay up there —6000, 8000, 10,000 feet
up, amid the winter snows and tempests, to keep
what they have gained. All stores and munitions,
after a short way by mule, must be carried up by
men —food, water, everything. The hardships of
war are everywhere; the trenches, the terrible Flan-
ders mud, the Russian marshes, the Carpathian peaks
—all are dreadful. But for what were considered as
insuperable natural obstacles nothing can vie with
the Dolomites.
The wedding of pretty Etta Norris and
Dr. Nicholas Larkins is dated for the first
week in March. He hangs out his sign at
Marrickville. A honeymoon trip to Japan
will follow. The bridal veil, embroidered on
filmy net by the nuns of Abbotsford convent
(Melbourne), crossed the Murray the other
day. It’s a minor miracle of fine stitchery,
with silken posies abloom in the corners.
Dr. Isabel Ormiston, the Sydney woman
who for over a year has been working at
various Fronts (there seems to be. no recog-
nised back to this mix-up), is now taking

tenegro, the delicate-looking woman admits
that she’s tired. She came through the
early horrors of Belgium and saw the hordes

conquerable Black 'Mountain to .her remini-

A very embarrassed Mrs. Fotheringhame
was handed a substantial token of esteem
by a number of Sydney womenfolk the other
afternoon. Mrs. "George Black was the
mouthpiece of the company. Skipper
Moodie-lleddle—the big Orkney sailor-man
who rules the wave on the Katoomba—came

of the Australian Trained Nurses’ Asso-
ciation, left the Dardanelles for England
with a hospital ship and its bandaged pas-
sengers. After a long spell of work, she is
snatching a holiday in London. The strenu-
ous Florence is a niece of Colonel Spalding,
who turned his sword into a forest devil in
the Nambucca district.
An Australian nurse writes home to say
that the worst shock she received since she

Frederiek Whitlow’s evening-out in St
James’s Hall was the best affair of the kind
in this young year. To begin with, Whit-
low, who dresses his samples of elocution in
character-actor style, mercifully spared a
limp February audience the wearisome itera
lion of pages of familiar Dickens stories.
And to go on with, the stage management
was excellent—in particular the blaze of
light that usually bores into the eyes of a
summer-night auuience was switched out.
In a musical interlude vocalist Murray-
Gibbes, an elegant young man much admired
by Our Girls, was acceptable, though he kept
the words to himself. Daisy Sweet, a tall
damsel in a fish-tail train, added her warble
to the event; and Trooper Cecil Gates, a
blithe young warrior home from Gallipoli,
threw a stirring appeal to “Be Australians’’
at the company.
S. M. Herald’s chief dramatie rouseabout
Gerald Marr Thompson, is again behind his
notebook. lie’s warmly congratulated by
adjacent members of local audiences on not
leaving his bones and his monocle in the
Jamieson Valley. The little man wandered
off the track in the Blue Mount in wilder-
ness, but had the luck to literally crawl back
to it after 30 hours and the equally good luck
to then meet a search party.
Some of the 13th Battalion Comforts
ladies had a recent “afternoon” in the Art
Society’s sweltering upper chamber. The
more or less asphyxiated expressions of those
present w r ere mostly glued on to the returned
heroes in khaki who limped in to share the
musical items. By the way, Mrs. Tom
Henley, president of this portion of the Bat-
talion Comforts Fund, scampered off to
Egypt; but it’s not impossible she’ll be
amongst the feminine pilgrims who are to
have their Saratogas re-labelled when they
get to Colombo. Lieut. Mitchell, one of the
returned 13th. is now back on duty and
hopes to have another shot at the foe. In
his hospital he held something of a record for
his badly-damaged battalion, having been
eight days in action before he was hit.
The ladies who jumped the title “Anzac
Buffet” —long in use in the cool cave in the
old Education building—are ruffling their
feathers. They only asked for “an acre of
the cricket pitch in the Domain and a
pretty piece of lawn near St. Mary’s
Cathedral.” They didn’t ask for the use of
Hyde Park or any other little thing like the
Law Courts. So they nearly got what they
wanted. But the indiscreet Minister who
made an affable verbal promise has revoked.
A lady, whose fore name is Sarah, has
since written a fierce letter to the
press. The piece of land offered in lieu of
the slice of the cricket pitch, etc., is re-
jected with suppressed scorn. So the old
original Anzac Buffet for Soldiers remains
in peaceful possession of the name.
Lyster Ormsby, the big man with a repu-
tation as an amateur athlete, is a new
recruity. He was wed to Ynys Sutton
Tatham a few weeks ago. The bride goes
on with her generous work as godma to the
children of mean streets. Surry Hills is
her beat. Just now she is packing up about
50 babes to bring them from Sunshine Camp
to their crowded city selection.
At the annual meet nf the Sydney Lieder-
tafel Society president A. W. Meeks was
up and down from the best chair. The
crux of the business was a change of name.
No longer will these male birds warble
under a label made in Germany. Hence-
forth they will be the Apollo Club. Apollo,
as you know, was the Greek antique who
had the bow, the lyre and the tripod for
his trademark. Now let’s pray that Con-
stantine keeps good, otherwise the choir
may have to go through this whole business
of christening again.
The dress problem of the moment is the
narrow skirt of yesteryear. Only a nin-
compoop would discard in wartime the
tailor-built skirt that, with its coat, ran
into a stiff figure. Yet it takes courage to
present to a scoffing assembly a figure like
a water-color cake when the lamp-shade cir-
cumference is It. A width, boldly put in,
of either silk or velvet, and with no attempt
to disguise its mission, is one of the daring
autumn tricks.
Sculptor J. C. Wright, the strapping
young Scot who recently won the Wynne
prize, goes to the Front before the year is
much older. Adelaide has given him the
local Ashton’s old billet as director of its
School of Art. And it also gives him leave
of absence till the end of the war. Of
late he has been attached to No. 7 School
of Instruction, and, bronzed and eager for
the fray, he has just rushed across to Adel-
aide to fix up things till Johnny comes
marching home again.
Just now the Sydney butterfly brigade in
Egypt is dazzled by the gauzy wings of its
most elegant fashion-plate, Mrs. Alex. Hay.
Mrs. Pat Osborne and Mrs. Tony Hordern
are also amongst the throng in Pharaoh’s
land. Mrs. Harold Suttor, another N.S.W.
woman, has been toiling since April at a
British lied Cross hospital there.
The 2nd Battalion Committee sends along
a report from the A.I.F. Gifts Store in
Cairo. Fifty cases of comforts are acknow-
ledged—with a sigh of relief that the work
of the distributing depots will be less dis-
tracting now that they haven’t to search
Gallipoli for Bill and Jim. Secretary Lar-
eombe, of the A.I.F. Gifts Store, pats the
2nd Battalion workers on their bump of
common-sense. Their goods arrived in extra-
good condition, he says, owing to the speci-
ally strong cases they came in. Earlier in
the war we didn’t know half the tricks that
we’re learning now, Arini!
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Sir Joshua Bartlett’s Book, “The Home Doctor,’
describing the New English Treatment for
CATARRH
ASTHMA
AND
BRONCHITIS
Sir Joshua Bartlett’s New Treatment for the cure of Catarrh
ant * all Bronchial Troubles is both simple ami inexpensive. His
•>ook, ihe Home Doctor, which explains the new treatment, has
already run into the (ilst edition, nearly all of which has been
distributed in Great Britain. No work of the kind has received
lull widespread and immediate recognition among members of
the medical profession. Nearly three thousand medical prac-
titioners have endorsed the New Treatment, and are actively
prescribing it among their patients. Thousands of men and
women ot all ranks of society and of all ages have been cured of
Catarrh and other Bronchial Troubles. Members of the nobility,
cle *'g} and many leaders of society are* among those who have
taken the New Treatment.
Sir Joshua Bartlett’s New Treatment is absolutely the FIRST
an ONL,\ cure for these diseases. No other method so com-
pletely reaches the affected parts—the SOURCE of the trouble.
«> ordinary inhalant—no spray or medicine—can reach the root
°f the disease. Many doctors have stated that Sir Joshua
Bartlett’s Treatment IS THE ONLY ONE THAT IVIUU DO IT.
Tl 'is book advocates in the most plain-spoken manner the
ew (ure for Catarrh and Bronchial Troubles, which have
hitherto defied all other for ns of treatment. It demonstrates
how they may he treated at mine quickly and inexpensively.
If you sutler from the dread disease of Catarrh, you can
cure it XOW—ABSOLUTE JjY. No matter how severe the
discharge—no matter how difficult the breathing—how distressing
your cough, how congested the breathing passages— : Sir Joshua
Bartlett’s New Treatment IS THE ONLY METHOD BY WHICH
YOU CAN BE CURED. Delay only brings more trouble. The
simple cold in the head may cause Catarrh. Soon the discharge
commences—the bronchial tubes become inflamed, and the
poisonous catarrhal matter drops down into the throat and finds
its way to the stomach, which brings on complications. The
disease soon becomes chronic, and results in Bronchitis, Asthma,
Catarrh of the Stomach, Deafness, etc., and frequently ends in
Consumption.
One of the most remarkable features of Sir Joshua Bartlett’s
Treatment is the lightning-like rapidity with which it gives
relief, and brings about a permanent cure. It calms the agitated
nerve centres, it clears the breath passages. It banishes the
choking paroxysms. It immediately relieves the congestion, and
stops all discharge.
More than 300,000 copies of “The Horae

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, February 7, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie. —
Governor Stanley is having a good loafing
holiday on Thule 1 the Frank Clarkes’ station.
He takes kindly to a horse, and the horse
puts up with him and never looks round to
see what a Governor is like in a soft felt hat
and dusty pants.
The Stricklands’ pallid Gent Help, Captain
Firth, is booked for a visit to the vice-regal
cot at Macedon. He came out to Australia to
convalesce, and the Stanleys think a whiff of
their mountain air may help on the process.
Leonard Lucas-Tooth is on his travels —
it is a honeymoon trip. He is encumbered
with the family title, which passed from his
late father this month last year, and then
slipped quickly past eldest son' Captain Sel-
wyn and second son Captain Douglas, both
of W'horn died on service. As well as the un-
remunerative handle, third son Leonard in-
herits a part-interest in the hereditary Beer.
And he has had “Lucas” crowned legally on
to his Tooth for ever.
At Kamarooka —the family estate near
Bega—the Tooth hostel is just completed. It
is a bit of magnificence, all on one floor, save
for the cellars and packing-rooms. In addi-
tion to glass windows and wooden doors to
keep the cows out it has hot and cold water
pipes, electric light and all modern luxuries,
including soap and clean tow - els. The place
w - as planned generously and begun before war
and Death thinned out the family. There is
a white-elephant look about it now. The
Tooth dowager lives in Hertfordshire, Eng-
land. and Captain Selwyn’s widow - resides in
London. The dead soldier tied up his share
of the money tightly for his small daughter,
and his w - idow - only has her income while she
retains his name.
Among the big subscribers to the second
war loan most of the few individual money-
bags w T ere Melbourne men. Admiral
Bridges, whose ancient towm-house flanks
the four-mile post at Toorak. and whose
immense slieeperies are at Traw’alla, in the
tame and woolly Western District, scraped
together over £lOO,OOO. Charles Fairbairn,
of Banongil, a neighbor of Bridges, found
he had a spare £50,000; and old George
Rolfe, a wholesale grocer of Bourke-street,
passed over an equal sum. Melba’s dad
reached down into his pocket for £40,000 —
most of it saved, no doubt, by following the
principle which impels him to travel second-
class when he goes up to look at the Lilydale
properties. Mt. Morgariaire Walter Russell
Hall’s widow dropped in her mite of £75.000;
and Thomas Buckland, who is something in
Sydney, added £43,000 to Mr. Higgs’s little
pile.
An unkind lady in Melbourne recently
home from London describes George. Reid’s
dancing as “the triumph of determination
over dead W’eight.”
Nortlicote and Bendigo are both elated
because Colonel A. H. Sturdee has been
made a C.M.G. You see, so many residents
in both places can claim “he’s my doctor”
and bask in the reflected glory. Colonel
Sturdee comes of fighting stock, and his son
is in this row with him. He’s a brother of
Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick Sturdee, so
there’s much honor in the clan.
Since the troops went into camp at Sey-
mour, taking a whole lot of nice young
officers to show them how - to march beauti-
fully. there has been unusual social activity
at Marengo, where the Goldies own the
sheep upon two dozen hills. Mrs. Goldie
used to be Laura Meudell, w - hose brother
George nowadays spends a great deal of
time trying to make Australia bubble with
oil; and the boss of Marengo is a person
of “ample manes,” as wulling as anyone to
do his share for Empire, even though it in-
volves sitting up till 2 a.m. behind a soda-
syphon.
David Oman, of Derrinallum, who repre-
sents Hampden in the Vic. Assembly, has
come up to the surface with a striking offer.
It is to hand over the gross proceeds from
his next season’s wdieat crop to the Returned
Soldiers’ Fund. Derrinallum is in the midst
of country where so far the sheep have kept
the wheat-farmer at bay with considerable
success; but the local sheep-men make a
few hundred on the side by putting in a
crop. While the 1916-1917 harvest is being
bagged, David of Derrinallum w ill make an
effort to live on bis income from the live
stock —and then, of course, there is ahvays
the trifle of £4OO from Parliament.
The youngest son of Felstead (of Soft-
goods Lane) is going to fly in the face of
the Hun as one of Britain’s airmen, while
the nice little Adelaide girl he married (for-
merly Miss Osborne) stays at home and
hopes the Hun’s aim w - ill be bad. The elder
Felstead boy is in Westralia preparing to go
to the war. lie has just married matron
Ilart, the young Juno who had charge of the
Beaconsfieid (Vic.) Foundling Home.
Captain Balmain, w - ho married a Fair-
bairn daughter, is now Major, and holds a
“shore” job at the British War Office. Mrs.
Balmain went to England to meet her pro-
moted husband, and became so fascinated that
she has hurried back to Australia to collect
her three babies and other belongings. They
depart hence by the Medina.
Char Crespin, the local youth with curly
hair who wrap-carried for one of our rulers,
has been invalided to England after fighting
in France since the beginning of trouble. His
letters home are stuffed with the names of
dukes and such he has met, and he says
he has been staying part of the time at
the Weymouth home of the Garnetts who
were in Australia with the British Commerce
Commission.
Ilughie McCubbin, son of the McCubbin
and brother of Louis, is in England, where he
has a job to make a dyspeptic of him. He’s
the inspector of food at military hospitals,
and he goes all around the country inspecting
what sick men devour, and assuring himself,
by personal inquiry, that the cooking is satis-
factory. The salary is not immense, but the
job is. Hughie deserved it. He was shot in
the shoulder and leg at Gallipoli, and will
carry a limp for life.
Lieutenant Cussen, who is the pride of
the Justice Cussen family, is here on fur-
lough. He was in England when the war
began, and didn’t wait to come home to
enlist. Joining the Armored Motor Corps, he
later fought in the same squadron as
Anthony Wilding. He’s modest about his
doings, but others say that he’s another of
the 50,000 whom Australia ought to be
proud to call son.
Adelaide solemnly advances to the type-
writer :—•
There were races on Monday at Victoria Park,
sports at the Semaphore, a regatta at Henley Beach,
and the Egyptian Fair at the Cheer-Up Hut. Having
duly opened the Fair at 11 o’clock, the Governor
made for Victoria Park, where he was due to lunch
with the A.R.C. Committee. Next day he departed
in the Governor Musgrave for a week’s visit to the
Gulf ports. Lady Galway is still at Victor Harbor.
From England comes news of the death of Harold,
the third of the Tennysons’ sons. He was a good-
looking, attractive small boy in the sailor-suit stage
during the Tennyson term at Government House
here. Mademoiselle Dussau, who was the boys’
governess, afterwards filled the same post for Prin-
cess Mary, and is still part of the household.
A Women’s Choral Society is shortly to be added
to the list of local noises. It is being organised by
Mr. John Dempster, and is partly the result of
necessity. Mixed choral societies are almost im-
possible to keep going since the war broke out; but
apart from that Adelaide wants to show itself as
musical as Melbourne, where Mrs. Peterson’s choir
shrieks.
Ernest Rymill and his brother, who went to Mel-
bourne with their rapid Tortoise., annexed the motor-
boat speed championship with it and so brought the
Griffith Cup. But no doubt you read all about it
in the newspapers.
The widow of Professor Tate died at North Adel-
aide since I wrote last. And Mrs. Gill, wife of the
Conservator of Forests, died suddenly in Hobart
during the early part of the week. She was holiday-
making in Tasmania when the Reaper met her.
To look at the old man you would never have
thought it, but, as a matter of fact, the just-dead
ex-Judge Boucaut had an extraordinary expert know-
ledge of the history and manufacture of violins. His
lady, who died years ago, was one of the squatting
McCullochs; and she prided herself that she could
drive a team of bullocks with any man.
An ancient row of terrace houses in Victoria
Square has passed into the hands of the Tramways
Trust for £22,000. The land originally belonged
to the Church Office, and was bought when it was
intended that the Anglican Cathedral should be in
Victoria Square. Of course, I don’t remember these
ancient transactions. But I’d love to have something
old and dusty that I could sell for £22,000.
The Wattle Day League’s Button Day for the
Ambulance Fund brought in over £lOOO, so that
the two new ambulances are certainties. The League
has raised over £4OOO for the white and red mercies,
and six of them are whirring about in Egypt.
Dr. Nattrass, who is a major when in
uniform, was married on Friday, after hav-
ing been on the social prize list for years
as an eligible with private means and an
excellent city practice. The pretty bride
was Matron Barton, of the Base Hospital,
in St. Ivilda-road. Severe dames who visited
the Base used to say quite frankly, “For
too young and pretty for the position !” as
scon as they set eyes on the dainty lady in
charge. But the delighted patients thought
otherwise. Nattrass relieved Dr. Garty
Salmon some little time ago and fatal symp-
toms set in at once. The joyful pair
departed in a huge orange touring-car for
the honeymoon trip (name of destination
censored).
Victor Leggo, a rich young man of Ben-
digo, is to quietly wed Ruby Crawford, a
goldfields girl, at the end of this month.
Ruby is the pretty little sister of handsome
Alice Crawford —who has decorated the
London stage for some years. The wedding
was to have been a local event, but the
groom-elect is mourning his mother and bro-
ther. so everything except the business part
of the wedding is “off.”
St. Peter’s, on Eastern Hill, was festive
on Wednesday evening, when Miss Jones
—usually “Miss Jam Jones,” of Hobart-
adopted the name of Tuckett. Her wedding
gown was so beautiful that girl friends are
still gasping. The bride made a staking
background for the garment, and was cer-
tainly the most picturesque note both at tne
wedding and at the celebrations which took
place afterwards at the Oriental.
Lieutenant E. It. Robinson before, he got
into khaki he was “Batty,” the writer of
learned golf notes—persuaded Mrs. t rank
Lincoln to say “I will” last Tuesday after-
noon. There was no orange blossom or
confetti. The ceremony took place just in
time for the couple to catch the Sydney ex-
press. But they’ll be back in a week to
explain to their friends why nobody was
asked.
“Itosna.” after the long spree
Anzac Christmas in London lasted 10 days. Un-
fortunately every Tommy Kangaroo who happened
to be in hospital was firmly tied there by a million
thongs of red tape, which no mere Australian could
expect to unravel; but the Australian War Con-
tingent Association and sundry others of us took in
as much Christmas as we could carry to these peni-
tentiaries.
For the boys on furlough revels began with a
Christmas spree at the A.N.A.’s Anzac Buffet, which
lasted from three to 10 p.m., with tiptop concerts,
refreshments and Christmas tree going all the time.
Also mistletoe. Especially mistletoe. Here some
battered colonels surprised us. The pretty wife of
General Birdwood went to the front, and was pre-
sented with a boomerang by Pte. Hamilton, V.C.,
while some 800 of her little man’s warriors shouted
applause. . Christmas continued at the Buffet until
Boxing night, w'hen there was a dance for Anzacs
and the girls who have been playing amateur
waitresses for them. Officers and men shared the
revel just as they had shared the trenches. That’s
fair, isn’t it?
Private Christmas sprees for the boys were legion ;
and on Christmas Day all who had not other fish to
fry were banqueted at the Cecil by the War Con-
tingent Association, with the Reids and Lady Bird-
wood and some more officialdom for decoration. The
feast, attended by 700 warriors, was followed by a
Crossley-and-other-stars concert.
At the Australian Hospital, Harefield Park, the
patients went out into the highways and hedges,
collected the village youngsters, and gave them a
giant tree and the best blow-out to be had in the
island. Wasn’t that just what you’d expect of our
big, brown, good-natured Bush brothers?
Ethel Dane thought she would take a
short holiday while her company was ex-
plaining what happened to Charlie’s aunt,
so she has packed her kit and started for
Burragaa station, which belongs to her
uncle, Howard Izon. Before she became
an exponent of “The Glad Eye” Ethel used
to paint Australian bush scenes, and she
has taken the necessaries for covering more
canvas.
Adrian Holland, the tall, artistic-looking
winner of the only gold medal and scholar-
ship given by the London College of Music
for competition in Australia, is to give a
recital at the Chapter House on February
IS.
Maud Fane’s husband, Warwick, is wear-
ing out his boots round town, while she is
working in the panto., clad in colored bal-
loons and other vanities. Maud is to go into
musical comedy later on, and then hubby is
to also have a show.
Some returned Australians mention hav-
ing seen Mrs. Maesmore Morris in England.
She is now Mrs. McDonald Sutor and was
visiting from Ceylon, where her husband is
in charge of the Mungalla Estate. Badulla.
(What nice fat names those are!) The
beauty of the day before yesterday is
plumper than of old, but she still has her
good looks and owns the complexion she
was noted for. What about begging her to
come to Australia for a season just to
show that woman can’t live near the Tropics
and escape a brown-paper face and other
hcrrors?
Canon Evelyn Snodgrass, somewhat fed
up with the holy calm of his velvet-piled
vicarage at Geelong, lately left the house-
cats in charge of a caretaker and departed
for The Cottage at Macedon, where his aunt,
Mrs. Ellis Rowan, dwells among the high
hills; and there, a round, pink figure of
perfect righteousness, he has been swimming
placidly in the social pool to his heart’s con-
tent and his soul’s undoubted well-b.eing.
Katherine £250-prize Prichard is to be wel-
comed-home at the Franeais on Wednesday,
16th inst., and many writer-people have
been bidden to the feast. There will be
many men and a few women; and in an
interval Katherine is to be compelled to make
at least one speech.
Herbert Syme, of the Age, has a new
yacht, and has been blowing up and down
amongst the Gippsland Lakes. One of his ex-
cursions into a backwater was a cold and
hungry experience. A westerly squall came
up over the Ninety Mile Beach with a spring
like a lion, and the ark was stranded on a
sandbank for three days and three nights
with no blankets and very little tucker. Fish
is hard to catch in stormy waters, but there
are always fools about even amongst fish, and
the victims were cooked well in native style.
A deep hole scooped in the sand made a fire-
place and driftwood the fuel; the catch was
wrapped in three double layers of wet brown-
paper (leaves or bark unprocurable), and as
soon as the paper burnt away dinner was
revealed grilled to a nicety.
Herbert Syme is keen on experiments, and
often manufactures excitement for himself.
Some time ago he indulged in a hydroplane
and took visiting Billy Williams out for a
water spin. The craft shot like an arrow or
a thrown boot into some thick reeds and
sunken, logs, and the inmates flew into the
air for 40ft. or so, then found the machine
wasn’t with them, and dropped like stones to
the bottom. Williams was fished out half-
drowned, but Herbert Syme is said to have
bobbed up still sucking at his pipe. The
expensive toy was a mass of wreckage, and
hasn’t been in commission since.
The Atherton girls are almost lost to
Melbourne since one of them married a
N.S.W. squatter. An Atherton certainly
flew through this village on the wav to the
Apple Island ; but most of us onlv saw the
dust clouds she raised. The girls are studying
nursing in Sydney in the hope of being
helpful to interesting heroes.
Mrs. Popplewell, the Sydney woman with
the voice, has handed over her London house
for a soldiers’ hospital, and has provided
some of the beds. Things must be flourish-
ing with the one-time singing lady.
The Major Manser pair are shepherding
their young flock on the slopes of Macedon
The Major, who is in charge of the troop-
ship department at the Navy Office, has not
fattened up after his recent illness. Rumor
says he is pining for the trenches, where all
good British majors have oecome either
generals or angels. The War Office lent
Manser to Australia, but Australia seems to
have taken him for keeps.
Naval-instructor Hall, Avith his wife, son
and daughter, returns to dear old England
this month. The family remain un-Aus-
tralianised; and if Mrs. Hall could put this
great country across her maternal knee and
use her slipper on it the concussions would
be tremendous.
For years Notley Moore has been P.M.
at Bendigo ; and latterly he has also chaired
certain metropolitan wages-boards. It has
therefore been necessary for him to lead a
double life, making frequent dashes to Mel-
bourne and trying to get used to railway
cookery. Now, at last, the authorities have
seen the wastefulness of this system and
have had the sense to bring the P.M. to
Melbourne for good, to assist in reducing
Patrick Dwyer’s overtime and help the hard-
worked Vivian Tanner to retain the curl in
his magisterial moustache.
Fashion, ■who is used to implicit obedi-
ence, decreed knee-high skirts; but for once
Fashion was ignored by the young and
graceful. However, the plump matrons who
wanted the dress disguises of youth flew to
obey; so it came to pass that there were
some special summer views of the fatted
calf on Portsea pier where the Best of
Toorak gathered this year. Odds are the
fatted calf will presently die of this sudden
publicity.
Two women “meds.,” Drs. A. L. Bennett
and G. Wisewould, are now resident boss-
erinas of the casualty ward at Melbourne
Hospital. One of the medicine men says
cryptically, “Women doctors on the staff
are harder to manage than men. but there
are compensations”—and then leaves you to
guess at the compensations. The lady
leeches are two young Australiennes who
went on to hospital work nine months ago
after topping the honor list at the Univer-
sity. Men doctors usually take a spell or
a locum tcnens job after the strain of the
finals, but these girls started in after a few
days’ rest. Nine of the hospital doctors
had just cleared off to the war, and assist-'
ance was urgently needed.
“Women could do any war work after a
term of ‘cas.’ work at the Melbourne,” said
the chief of the medical staff. “It is ter-
rible work for women, but they have gone
into it -with their eyes open and are in every
way as satisfactory as men.” Dr. Bennett
had a month of day work while a mere man
did the late-drunks’ work at night. Now
the two women share the work day and
night.
Dr. Bennett is slender and cool and self-
possessed, with a reputation for tact and
quick thinking in emergencies. She sports
white linen, tailored in correct military
style, with an assortment of adorable poc-
kets all over the coat. But the wearer,
supremely unconscious of the dazzle of her
smart white linen, chats on, and says one
soon becomes used to night calls and getting
sleep between w - hiles. There is a fine,
hefty wardsman downstairs who soothes the
obstreperous patient until the girl on duty
is ready to bind up his cut head or other
wounds. Since the Early Closing Act came
iu the whirling “casualty” of the small
hours is less frequent. But besides the
drunk there is the patient who suddenly
decides, lying at home in bed. to seek hos-
pital treatment immediately. Once a woman
arrived at three in the morning; her com-
plaint was one of 23 years’ standing, but
she had just managed to make up her mind.
The big hospital will be depleted of all its
present men “residents” this year except
two, who are being retained for special
help. Incidentally there is great joy in the
wards because surgeon Syme is resuming
duty.
W. E. Dexter, chaplain to the Australians
in Gallipoli, who has been mentioned in
dispatches, doesn't limit his knowledge
of pilotage to the sky variety. In
earlier life he followed the sea, and
eventually gained his master’s ticket.
Latex - , the Church called him ashore,
and lie sat down and wrestled with books
till he got a B.A. degi - ee at Durham (Eng.)•
Dexter_took a hand in the S’African shindy
some 15 years ago, and then settled down as
a parson, his most recent job being at St.
Barnabas’s, South Melbourne.
Maoriland is applauding the Newsham
family, of Ormond, Poverty Bay. Five
brothers have gone to the Front, and nearly
as many sisters are nurses on active ser-
vice. The last brother to go is Herbert, who
w - as lately charged with evading khaki.
On that occasion he told the magistrate that
his brothers had gone to the Front, leaving
him to work the place single-handed, and
that he intended to get into uniform as soon
as. he could sell out. The case was dis-
missed ; but all the same Newsham was
later called upon to defend himself again.
A country that spreads the social butter for
hundreds of eligibles might have found some-
thing better to do than harass the only repre-
sentative of a fighting family. But the Law
always was an ass with a large capacity for
discovering the sorest, tiredest toe to plant
its hoof on.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Merrigal”: Some further remarks about
that favorite chew of the Central Australian darkies,
pituri (or bedgery), corresponding with the betel-
nut of the Eastern Archipelago. The tops of the
plant when in blossom are garnered and hung up to
dry, sometimes sweated between layers of sand.
When thoroughly dried they are roughly powdered
and packed for transport—in netted bags, as a rule.
These bags are identical in size, pattern and
material, and constructed by weaving together twp
circular mats of the bag material and folding over
the powdered product, jam-tart fashion. The con-
tainer is then sewn up with fibre. Sydney Techno-
logical Museum shelters two of them, donated by
the owners of Mount Margaret station (S.W. Queens-

land), who got them from the Herbert River blacks.
The abos. also damp and mix the leaves with potash
from the ashes of suitable plants, and roll up in
cigar shape, to be smoked or chewed. A little of
the resultant saliva if swallowed will assuage hunger
and enable long journeys to be made with but little
other tuck. That old enthusiast in research, Dr.
Bancroft, analysed some specimens of pituri from
the Kulloo waterholes, near Eyre’s Creek, and found
nicotine, the presence of which may account in a
measure for the duskies’ fondness for the vegetable.
“Lou”: What sort of a caterpillar is this?
He is about an inch long, wears a dirty white or
grey furry overcoat, has horns with round knobs
on ’em, four round spurs or spikes sticking out of
his back, a portmanteau on his bingy, a black line
running down centre of same, small brown head,
and when I introduced myself he was doing a
vaudeville act hanging suspended from an invisible
wire.

“Flabby Paul” on the subject of Jimmy
Grey
The assistant-surveyor sent Ned to the township
for tucker with the old grey packhorse, known as
Jimmy Grey. Jimmy Grey fell down on the road
and died. The old horse’s body had to be removed
and as no dry wood could be found, the A.S. decided
to bury the deceased beside the road. He was
duly interred, a mound was made, and the A.S.
erected a cross and painted on the cover of a
kerosine tin (which he nailed to the cross) :—-
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JAMES GREY.
Who Departed this Life at the Age of 26.
R. I. P.
He also hung a wreath of scrub flowers on the
cross. An officious cocky (a J.P.) passed soon
after and noticed the grave. lie informed the police-
man at the township that a man had died on the
road and had been buried without an inquiry. The
Jay Pee and the policeman rode out and called at
the camp. They asked the A.S. if he had heard
of a man dying thereabouts. The A.S. said he
hadn’t. However, he, the cocky and the policeman
accompanied by the camp proceeded to the scene of
the tragedy. The A.S. was visibly affected when
they arrived at the grave and had to turn away
to hide his sorrow. The policeman asked the camp
to assist him to disinter the deceased. The camp
said its feelings wouldn’t allow it to interfere with
the grave of a fellow creature, so the cocky and
the policeman shed their coats and commenced
shovelling out the earth. They were encouraged
to further efforts by the camp, till the cocky got
angry and told it to mind its own business. At
last the two officious toilers came to the body and
recognised Jimmy Grey. There was no veil in
these parts large enough to spread over the scene
that followed, and the language of the cocky and
J.P. could have been heard through six feather beds.
* * * • *
“H.G.”: In the early ’6o’s Pat Minahan
kept a pub at Donnybrook, on the Maranoa, out west
from Roma. It was all paper money in those days—
cheques and lOU’s, the latter often torn and useless
before being presented, and as often as not never
presented. Cheques of three figures were knocked
down in as many, days. When a drover, fencer or
tank-sinker handed a cheque over the bar Pat would
ask, “Is it ‘No mercy’?” “Yes.” Then “No mercy”
would be written across the back, and Pat would
take down a bugle that'hung ready, and blow as if
it were the Last Day, and the news would fly round:
“Minahan’s got a ‘No mercy’ cheque.” Tools would
be flung down and camps deserted, and a general rush
would be made for the pub. Then a tremendous
spree would start. Singing, card-playing, wagering,
fighting, and all the rest of it. Of course there was
a “deadhouse” attached to the pub, and into this
the drunks and disorderlies were emptied for the
night. In the morning when the revellers turned
out, with shaking limbs and burning throats, Pat
would point to an army of empty champagne bottles
and say, “Nothing but champagne would do you boys
last night.” When a cheque was “cut-out,” Pat
would call the depositor aside and ask him where he
wanted to go, and no matter how far it was, even to
200 miles, a waggonette and pair would be provided,
with a couple of bottles of grog and provisions, and a
reliable driver would take the impecunious one to his
destination. Meals were never charged for; the
grog paid well enough without assistance. I have
known two brothers get through a £ 700-cheque at
Pat’s in a fortnight, and I think three men could
have drunk the Koh-i-noor there in a month.
MAN’S FALL.
OLD GENT: “Dear me, what. caused you to fall from that top window?"
THE NUT: “The infernal decit of a woman, dem' it! She said her beast of a husband
had gone to Europe."
“481”: An Australian crow suddenly
dumped down in Egypt would be amazed at the
fearless way in which his near relatives, the ravens,
approach human beings. In Kasr-el-Nil barracks
there are thousands of ravens, and at meal times
a whistle is suffifcient to bring them in scores to take
meat from the hands of the soldiers. A bone or
piece of meat thrown into the air is invariably caught
before it reaches the ground. Apropos of crows, one
flew over our trenches at Anzac one day. A melan-
choly “caw, caw,’’ startled us, and one incredulous-
looking trooper suddenly yelled, “Strike me pink,
there’s an Australian up there.” Everyone looked
up and there was an instantaneous outbreak of
“caws” all along the trench, mingled with cries of
“Hello, Kelly.” The Turks heard the rumpus and
opened on our trenches with rapid fire, evidently
thinking we were about to attack.
* * » *
“Lagani-Namo”: As soon as you see the
Semitic-nosed, kinky-haired, stalwart natives of
Kiwai island, in the estuary of the Fly River (Papua),
you ruminate, “This surely is a race quite distinct
from the Papuan, and must be the progeny of an
original conjunction between folk of Israel’s Lost
Tribes and the African negro.” Local tradition
alleges that the antecedents of the Kiwaians were
borne to that island from a very distant country by
huge birds. Kiwai was so different from the
passengers’ former habitat that had not the
birds remained and provided them with food
until the people discovered how to catch the
peculiar fish and beasts thereabout and how
to extract the sago from the swamp-palms
they would have starved. The people were even
unable to produce fire, and although the birds made
several special voyages for the purpose of bringing a
light to the island they never succeeded. One after-
noon the people noticed smoke travelling toward
them from seaward. Soon they discerned it to be
two black cockatoos carrying a glowing eocoanut
husk, which they deposited on the beach. The
Kiwaians were so overjoyed that they transferred
their homage to the cockatoos, and the giant birds
in contempt of this ingratitude vamoosed. I dunno
where they went.
* * * *
“McNorth” : A Papuan Government offi-
cial was once the most embarrassed man in the
South Seas. It was considered desirable that a spot
on the Papuan coast should be marked as the pent
of commencement of the boundary between British
and Dutch New Guinea. For this purpose the two
Governments arranged to send’ their representatives
to meet at the spot agreed upon and formally declare
the boundary. The nearest British station to Dutch
New Guinea being Daru, in the Western Division
the then Resident Magistrate of that place was in-
structed to proceed to the rendezvous as the British
representative. The only vessel available was a
little, dirty, cockroach-inhabited cutter belonging to
the station, and in this, with half a dozen niggers
for crew, the R.M. sailed westward. Through dirty
weather he was delayed a day or two, .and when he
reached the meeting-place the Dutch ‘were already
there. That magistrate will never forget the sight
that met his eyes when he rounded the low headland
into the bay. A snow-white sloop-of-war with flags
flying lay at anchor, and a shining gunboat rolled
easily in the light swell. Various other vessels swung
to the tide. On the beach a large marquee and
many smaller tents were displayed. Bands were play-
ing, and squads of Chinese and Malay soldiers drilled
and manoeuvred. White-clad Europeans moved about.
The R.M. rubbed his eyes. What on earth was this
fairv-like scene doing in the savage wilds of Western
Papua? Then, as his disreputable cutter lowered its
dirty, tanned sails and came to anchor near the
sloop, he remembered having read of the Dutchman’s
fondness for pomp and display. A spotlessly-clothed
Dutch officer and a guard of soldiers' met the R.M.
when he landed from his dinghy and inquired his
business. He explained that he was the representative
of British might and majesty come to meet the
Dutch officials as arranged. The Dutchman care-
fully brushed an imaginary speck of dirt from his
sleeve, and looked from the Britisher’s travel-worn
khaki trousers and singlet to the evil-looking cutter,
and smiled. There was a dickens of a lot of argu-
ment and examination of papers before our man was
accepted for what he claimed to be. But all turned
out well. The spot was marked, much fizz was spilt,
and everybody shook hands with everybody else. But
that magistrate was not entirely relieved of his
embarrassment till he was again aboard the cutter
and fairly on the thrash back to Daru.

“Ino”: If “W.F.” (B. 13/1/T6), who
wants to know how to tell points of the compass in
the bush, will look for any upright tree he will see
that the bark on the northern side is always cleaner
and smoother than that on the southern side. This
won’t be so on a tree with much lean, for then the
upper side is clean and the under rough, no matter
which way the incline is. And in all cases look at
several trees, as sometimes scrub acts as a shelter
from the sun and makes a difference. White and
yellow box are easily first for this test.

WHEN YOUR LUCK SEEMS OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When your spree is fairly over,
And your horse has leaped the bar,
And your fancy saddle’s sold for thirty bob,
Back to camp, per boot, you’re going,
It ne’er seemed so far before,
And your head keeps time for walking with a steady-
going throb.
'Till at last, through dancing heat-waves,
You can see a blur of white,
And you struggle onward for a feed and sleep.
Soon you’re cursing all creation,
And can scarcely keep from crying,
Spread before you is a wreckage that would make
the angels weep.
For the cattle have been through it,
And gone out the other end,
Your blankets are all trampled in the dust,
And the flour and sugar’s mingled
With the butter and your clothes—
And the whole thing makes you wonder-whether God
is really just.
You have fixed youi tent and dunnage,
And are nearly half-asleep,
When your dog begins a-barking and you hear a
stockwhip crack ;
Then you know the boss is rousing,
That the final blow is coming,
And you struggle to the tent-door just in time to get
the sack.

A Wonderful New Instrument!
The Aeolian Vocation
Tones from a disc record you never heard before
Have you heard the Aeo-
lia n-Vocalion that tonal
instrument whose voice
is art?
There are many features in the Aeo-
lian-Vocalion that contribute to its
pronounced musical superiority and
its extraordinary tone. Some of these,
like the marvelous Graduola device
for controlling tone, are entirely
novel and startling. Others, like its
new and scientific Sound Box and
Symphonetic Horn, are in the
nature of higher developments of
existing features.
How these features have been de-
veloped —the origination of some of
them in single brilliant inventions,
and the slow processes attending the
attainment of others, constitutes one
one of the most interesting stories in
musical history.
We invite you to try one of your own
records on the Vocation — as we be-
lieve that your comments to your
friends concerning it will be valuable
to us.
You can buy a Vocalion for as little as £25 for a small initial payment
and payments thereafter as low as 35/- a month.

“Wang”: Astonishing is the shyness of
the way-back girl. Years ago, as a kid, I was em-
ployed by a cocky at Darrawingeewop. The next
farm was run by two brothers and a sister, named
Ramsay. Wild yarns of the sister’s extreme shyness
in the presence of male strangers were rife. One
day I was sent over to Ramsay’s on a message. We
had not had any rain for weeks; but on this parti-
cular day a thunderstorm was brewing. Nearing
Ramsay's house I saw Jessie. She didn't see me till
I was close up; then she fled for her life round a
corner of the house. I followed in great haste; but
on turning the corner I could see no sign of her. I
knocked at the door but couldn’t get an answer.
Then the.thunderstorm broke and the rain came down
in sheets. I stood in the porch and waited, but it
seemed as if that storm had come to stay. Presently
strange sounds reached my ears, apparently from a
400-gallon tank that stood near the porch. Lord!
they sounded creepy. Then the Water started to run
out of the overflow pipe near the top, and there
were some more suffocating, sobbing sounds. Sud-
denly something wild and wet and long-haired and
terrified appeared through the hole in the top of the
tank and screamed at me. I didn’t wait for any
more, but put up a new mile record for home. I
believe Jessie was bad with a cold or something for
a long time after that.

“Hay” : The Centralian abo. isn’t used to
large bodies of water and has a habit of very much
exaggerating the size of his little drinking pools
when describing them to the anxious inquirer, and
this, until one knows his peculiarities, is a bit mis-
leading. A supply that cannot be drunk in a single
carouse seems to him quite inexhaust-
ible. I remember spending several
weeks once cut off by flood waters in
company with a mob of sheep and a
staff of binghi assistants. I passed
most of the time in an empty wool
bale and managed to keep fairly dry.
But the blacks got very tired of the
storms that kept coming up from the
north-west. At last one binghi under-
took to stop the disagreeable damp-
ness. Clothed simply in a boomerang
and spear he mounted the highest
rock on our island and remonstrated
vigorously with the elements ; hut the
rain streamed down his shining hide
till at length he gave up in despair.
Asked why the rain didn’t cease when
he told it to, binghi put his failure down to the
fact that another blackfellow, much stronger, was
driving it on away from another camp.

“N.”: I quite agree with what “Tropicus”
(B. 6/l/’l6) says as to the virtues of potassium
permanganate as a snake-bite specific, having seen
it used on tiger-snake wounds in that very viperish
part, Tasmania. But the Condy preparations are
not pot. permanganate, though commonly under-
stood to be such. At least, the Condy people offici-
ally stated long ago that none of that chemical
entered into their preparation. Anyhow, Condy’s,
though valuable, isn’t as good for bites as the real
thin g-
BITTER POLITENESS.
OLD GENT (to bog who has carried baggage): “There, m’ lad, there’s a penny for you.”
BOY (with bitter sarcasm): “’Adn’t I better come inside and write yer a receipt?”
“Pick”: Monaro (N.S.W.) sheep-men
think that at last they have got at the cause of
“black disease,” the scourge that during the summer
and autumn months, for past decades, has decimated
their flocks and mystified every vet. imported to
work out cause and cure. On Bibbenluke and other
big squattages subdivision of runs and statistical
observation have shown that the heaviest mortality
is invariably confined to paddocks in which water-
cress grows abundantly, and owners are loudly
demanding that the succulent vegetable be declared
a noxious weed. Meanwhile, they are not waiting
for the P. P. Board to move, but are diverting the
watercourses wherever possible to kill out the
suspected plant.
BIBLICAL.
LOCAL PRAICHER : “Brethren and sistern,
thewse be stirring times we do be livin’
in. But we should remember the words
of the Good Old Book, where it do say
‘ England expects that every man this
day will do ez duty.’”
“Mulga”: Here’s a simple and effective
dodge to prevent ants from raiding the safe or
holding a banquet on the table. Wrap pieces of
flannel soaked in turpentine round the legs and
recite “The Burial of Sir John Moore.”
“A.N.T.”: Another instance of the fidelity
of the Australian cattle-dog. Whilst passing through
Singleton (N.S.W.) from camp at end of August
two kiddies bundled their pet into our carriage.
Since then we can’t lose that dog. He hung to us in
Egypt, ignored the layman’s dress, and would only
be petted by our unit. Same happened on the trip
to Anzac, where we tried to lose him on the trans-
port. Two day's later he was found curled up in my
dugout; and “Binghi” was still in camp when I was
removed to an abode of rest for bulleted soldiers.
* * * *
“Tenaculum”: Seems odd that none of
The Bulletin’s South American correspondents
make mention of the curious disease peculiar to the
mountains of Peru, and locally' known as las verrugas
—“the warts.” It is always more or less prevalent
in the deeper and narrower Andes valleys, and
becomes fatal when it assumes the epidemic form.
Non-natives are more liable than natives, and new
arrivals more than the acclimatised. There is first
a period of fever, which is relieved when the warts
come out, sometimes in hundreds and of great size.
I have seen a poor devil of an English navvy covered
almost from head to foot with horrible-looking excres-
cences as big as hazel-nuts. These warts in time
break up and fall off, when severe bleeding from
their sites generally sets in, or the places become
chronically ulcerated ; and, even if the sufferer pulls
through, he may remain a wreck for years.

“T.F.” ; Wild-pig hunting is a profitable
week-end spree between Collarenebri (misspelt bv
wei-y mnth backblocker) and Goodooga, in Nor’-West
N.SAY. Sometime in the long ago strays from set-
tlers gave the wild hog a start, and nowadays
between the Barwon and Warrego a hearty meal can
always be shot or run down. There’s nothing amiss
with wild pig as a meat, either; its fodder is chieflv
roots, and it is careful to dig for the best tubers
Catch him young and he is fit for king or people; and

slate in Sussex-street.
“Hay” : In the year I*7o more than one
mob of cattle travelled right through from the
Tompson ltiver (Q.) to Adelaide. That vear bein',
remarkably wet, there was no difficulty in obtaining
water all the way. At that time 600 miles of the
journey, between Windorah (Q.) and the far north-
eastern settlements of South Aus., was through conn
try that was absolutely unoccupied. Three years
later one of the Queensland drovevs decided to sm
south by the same route to look for a job, and
started out with his wife, two infants and three
horses. After going too far to turn back it became
more and more evident that conditions had totally
changed. Water, instead of being plentiful, was
very difficult to find. By sheer pluck, however, the
party battled through and arrived at Bimbowrie
station, then the farthest north-eastern station in
South Aus., in an exhausted state. The last lto
miles was made without any moisture whatever. I
have always regarded this trip as the champion lono-
ride for a woman, and marvelled at the way the in"
trepid bushman brought his family safely through
such arid stages. The manager of Bimbowrie gave
him an easy job shepherding, but as soon as he
regained his strength he collected his wife, children
and horses and moved on in hopes of finding some
really strenuous work.
* * * *
“Nick Bottom”: Let me introduce the
most beautiful and yet most repugnant of all sub-
tropical vegetation. It is commonly known as the
stinking fungus, and it grows in the scrub forest?
of north-eastern N. S. Wales. At first sight a per-
son is inclined to think that he has accidentally
discovered a fairy's wardrobe, a gossamer woven
from bees’ wings, cunningly dyed and spread out to
dry. On taking it up, however, all these poetic
fancies are shattered, for the odor that it gives off
is absolutely vile. On a wet day one can smell these
fungi twenty yards off, and at a distance of ten
yards the effluvium resembles that of a badly-venti-
lated room in which half a dozen old maid cats
have been imprisoned for a week.
“Rita S.”: If the man on the land ever
lias rendered to him the account which he owes to
the speckled woodpecker of our bushland spaces I
presume he won’t pay it; he’ll be broke if he does.
Week in, week out, the natty, sturdy little pest-
hunter plies his craft, stripping the gums of their
vermin-hiding bark, exploring the crevices of the
dead trees and logs, waging warfare against the
winged enemies of the soil-tickler. The small bird
is not so common along the rivers as he used to be;
why, I cannot say. Maybe it is the increase in
the number of water-rats which explore every crevice
of the hollow logs and stumps adjacent to the rivers,
wherein “the tappers” build their nests; or maybe
it’s the march of devastation, or civilisation, or what
you like to call it. Baby Woodpecker is the sweet-
est imp of birddom I know, much like the English
thrush, or brown quail, but smaller, a confiding little
chap that only a water-rat would harm. Peewits
and wagtails still haunt the rivers, but the pea-rifle
in the hands of the bush-boy vandal is abroad, and
the insectivorous tribes decrease. The tiny tomtits
LACKING IN IMPORTANT DETAILS.
COW-COCKY: “So that’s Venus, is it? Well,
I don't go much on ’er. Orright so far
as she goes, but where'd she be when it

of our few hedges are first-rate aphis-exterminators,
but wire fences are taking the place of the hedge-
rows, and these friends of the gardener and flower-
lover are driven to the flood jetsam of the rivers.
1/1 the near future the lament of moth-battler and
locust-chaser will be loud in the land when it is too
late.
GETTING EVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You had to work at Sandy Mack’s
As hard as you could lick,
And all -day’ long Jim swung an axe,
Or drove an anchor pick,
Uprooting fearsome stumps. The game
Puts every other graft to shame.
Jim’s back was prematurely lame.
The sky glowed like another hell,
The wind was barbed with fire,
And as the stinging sunbeams fell
Jim hugged his growing ire.
He leathered at the iron roots.
The perspiration filled his boots.
He keenly felt the jackass hoots.
A snake stole out, silent as thought.
Jim seemed to lose his wits,
And in a sort of fury fought.
He chopped the snake to bits.
“I’d not be slavin’ here,” said Jim,
“A-grubbin’ bloomin’ limb from limb,
If ’twasn’t for the likes of him!”

A Small Economical Car
With Big' Car Advantages
Many people prefer a small car—one that is light and economical to run —
yet one having the advantages of the large and high-priced cars.
Model 75 is designed and built to meet
these requirements.
Selling at an unusually low price it is a
comfortable family car with most of the
advantages of the very large cars.
While it is light— 19 cwt. —-this
Overland rides with a restful ease of motion
usually found only in far more expensive cars.
Roomy seats, with soft cushions over
deep, coiled springs, give real big car comfort.
This is further insured by rear springs
of the famous cantilever type. These are
probably the easiest riding springs ever
designed.
They absorb not only up and down
shocks but side sway as well.
Four-Inch tyres all around add much
to the sum total of riding 1 comfort.
No other car combines such comfort
with extremely economical maintenance.
The powerful block motor gives all the
power you will ever want. Yet it is most
economical in fuel consumption.
The light weight of the car makes for
economy.
We want you to ride in this Overland.
Test out its comfort to vour own satisfaction.

A WOMAN’S MISERY
Pain in Back, Tired Feeling, Scalding Pain, Cloudy Urine,
Snappy Temper, Rheumatism.
All women suffer—some more than others—during some periods of their lives. Have you
ever stopped to think why this should be? Long-suffering women become so used to it as to
think that they must suffer for the rest of their natural lives. This is wrong. Most of this
suffering is absolutely unnecessary, and is in many cases due to kidney or bladder trouble-
nothing more. And you can prove it.
Kidney and bladder trouble is far commoner than most people would imagine. It is
reported that at least six out of every ten people who “go sick” do so through kidney disease.
And, moreover, five out of every ten sufferers die from this same cause. If people only knew
how to tell whether their kidneys were diseased or not it would not be so bad, but thousands
upon thousands of men and women to-day are content to suffer and die in ignorance. Meat
kidneys lead to deadly Bright’s Disease in many cases.
Sure and Certain Symptoms of Kidney Trouble.
How are you to really recognise Kidney Trouble? Here is the way:—Have you a nasty
tasm in the mouth the first thing in the morning, puffiness under the eyes, general feeling of
weakness and irritability, aches and pains in various parts of the body ? Have you constipa-
tion, cloudy mine, or sharp stabbing or aching pains—a pain “as though my back will break ?
People who suffer from backache, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone, cystitis
(inflammation of the bladder), or pains in the muscles and joints, are all suffering these pains
through weak or diseased kidneys, for these are positively the symptoms of kidney trouble.
. These si S ns of kidney or bladder trouble are caused by the poisonous acid in the blood
which the kidneys should remove, but they do not, owing to their being in a w-eak state. Be
itt s Ividney and Bladder Pills quickly remove these symptoms. You should go to your
chemist at once for a box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and prove for yourself that
within twenty-four hours these wonderful pills have without doubt commenced their healing
wOl k guaranteed. Do not put off, because w r eak kidneys very often means Bright’s Disease
111 | ie en( l- But when you buy the pills be sure yum get De Witt’s, in large white boxes printed
m blue and gold—with a blue wax seal on the top of the bottle. Refuse any of similar name
without this special seal.
Oh,
Back !

“H.R.”: “Warre” (B. 13/1/’IG) speaks
of giving a fair deal to country agents for
the wheat-shipping firms. These men, he
says, get 3d. a bag for handling. This costs
them fd. for stacking and id. for trucking,
leaving lfd. to the agent for his work,
which consists of getting a promise from
the farmer, keeping a few records, and
writing out the cheques. What “Warre”
might more reasonably have suggested was
the abolition of these so-called agents, and
(1) the appointment of one agent-clerk to
attend to all the wheat and issue the coup-
ons; (2) giving an experienced lumper the
contract for roofing and dunnage. This
method would cut out four of the five
agents that are at present waiting at this
railway-station to handle 70,000 bags, to
the great advantage of the farmer-man who
does the real toil and takes the risks.

A ghoulish case came before a Sydney
suburban court the other day in which Pri-
vate Enterprise in the undertaking trade
sued for the balance of an account on a
time-payment transaction. The firm had
flourished t.p. terms before the widow as an
inducement to her to do the thing properly;
and the total bill had reached £22. Only a
small balance was left unpaid when the long,
weary process of wiping off a dead husband
wore out the suffering dame, and she failed
to meet the instalments. Of course, there
was no defence, and the burial people got a
verdict, accompanied by a few remarks from
the Bench. The words were to the effect
that a firm which exploited grief on easy
terms to drag cash out of the widow and
the orphan didn’t deserve to collect the loot
even if it had the Law on a string at its
side.

•T. F. Daly’s tale of sin :
He regards himself as IT in the matter of “fly-
ness,” and was referred to as the “genial boniface”
when we had a shivoo, about a week back, as a send-
off to six cobbers who were going to have a cut at
the Kaiser.
At 10.30 a.m. Jim and a cove who cracked drunk
and was supposed to have just come back from the
war, bob in. The soldier has a “lemon and lime”
and Jim a “mug and green.” After a bit the sol-
dier says, fumbling in his belt and through his
pockets: “Here, Billo” (his name is Jim), “take
thish 20 quids and put it in zh bank ! I might lose
it,” and hands four fivers to Jim, who says, “You
wait ’ere fer me —I’ll be back at 11.” Then he
mops up his beer and does a duck.
Mr. Pro Bono Publicano soon opens out on the
shickered swaddy.
“You silly chump,” he says. “Do you know who
that cove is who has gone off with yer gilt? Well,
he’s one of the greatest guns in Sydney, and it’s only
a fluke he’s not in gaol now. You can say good-bye
to your stuff. Back at 11! Gorstruth!”
“No blanky fearsh! Good old Billo—Vs orl right.
Bet yer anything! Bet yer 20 quidsh, bet yer”
He pulled out notes and 'counted out 20. “There,
cover that! Bet yer million quidsh!”
“Here, sonny,” says the boss to me, “hold this
sugar, and if that cove ain’t back by 11 the wager’s
mine. Isn’t that so ?”
“Bet me life on old Billo,” drivelled the soldier;
and just then in walked Jim, with the bank receipt
for 20 quid.
I handed him the 40 pounds, though I have my
doubts whether “Billo’s” friend had any right to be
in khaki.

“F.W.F.” from Nelson (M.L.) :
I enter the steamer Lady Barkly for the ancient
tubs’ race. She was Governor Barkly’s yacht, and
as he stopped governing Victoria in 1863 she has
been going more than half a century. She has been
patched and patched till there is hardly any of the
original left. The captain fell overboard one trip
when nobody was looking. He swam ashore and
made for Nelson Port, where he found his ship at
the wharf. She made it herself and was resting with
the tired feeling that old age brings. A local paper
stated once that she broke her moorings during a
storm, and after suffering some injury on the rocks
was found making her way to the local hospital for
first aid. An intelligent craft is the Lady Barkly.
* * * *
“Hamer”: A wife like Mrs. Jones would
be a great help to any man. Jones is never
reticent about the details of his chronic in-
debtedness ; so when I was at his house the
other afternoon, and he was called to discuss
urgent affairs at the door, I knew that the
landlord had arrived in pursuit of his rent.
By-and-bye the door closed, but when Jones
came back he didn’t look as a man should
after repelling the enemy. “Don’t speak so
loud,” he whispered. “He’s still there. He
says he’s going to stay till he gets his rent.”
That brought Mrs. Jones into action. Casu-
ally remarking that she would speak to him
she left the room. A few minutes later,
when we heard the front door open again,
Jones peeped out—then eagerly beckoned me.
Madame was passing out some pillows and
blankets. “Mr. Jones tells me that you
intend to stay here,” she was saying sweetly.
“I’m afraid you won’t find it very comfort-
able ; and it will probably rain one night
this week. But there’s plenty of Wankets, and
I’ll send you out some supper. Aina
of an hour later we went to see if the lan
lord was comfortable, but the blankets and
pillows were the only parts of the incident
remaining. #
“Anilin”: The observations of “Analyst”
(B. 13/1/TO) are interesting, but from tne
experiments he mentioned only three or tour
colors could be obtained, as against the hun-
dreds of shades derived from synthetic or
chemical dyestuffs. This leads to the remark
that it is the shortage of these dyes which
nowadays forms the problem for one class ot
Australian manufacturers. Prior to the war
75 per cent, of the world’s output came from
13 German establishments, the other 25 per
cent, from 15 other works equally divided
betw’een Britain, France and Switzerland. At
this time the Australian market was almost
wholly catered for by Hun firms, which
kindly left a little business for a few British
and Swiss concerns. It must be admitted
that Germany secured this profitable grip,
not by cheapness, but by the general excel-
lence of its dyes and the aid of a highly-
efficient business organisation. One firm pro-
vided its customers with suitable sets of
trade formulas showing how its dyes should
be used —and they were not bad sets either.
When Europe blazed up and Prussia used
her dye works and laboratories_ for making
explosives and the more torturing gas, the
dependent Australian was right up against
it for the wherewithal to color his boot polish
and his Sunday hat—unless he had in the past
been sentimental enough to hand some of his
orders to John Bull. Swiss supplies were
hopeless, as they had been dependent upon
Germany for raw materials. British supplies
have been steadily declining, owing to a tre-
mendously-increased local demand and the
Government action in commandeering some
of the works for the production of picric acid.
Worse still, the quality is now not so good,
and the range of colors is ' strictly limited ;
but we are avid for dyes, and take whatever
we can get at soaring prices. Certainly dyes
will be obtainable after the war, and the
price of the Hun variety produced by the
cheap labor of their vast war wreckage will
come down very low. Meanwhile what are we
doing? Just fluttering around the problem
in a few laboratories —and carefully passing
the real job on to posterity, which is far
easier.

“Devilfish” : It was stated the other day
that a recent find of ambergris was the
richest discovery of this valuable stink ever
made on the Australian -coast. No ; it was
small potatoes compared with the haul made
at Port Davey (Tas.) about 30 years ago
by two Hobart fishermen, Harry Smith and
Louis the Portuguese. They happened into
Port Davey just as the Waterwitch. one of
the last of the old-time whalers, was finishing
up a dead whale. Smith and his mate
had been whalers and knew something about
ambergris, so they asked the captain for
what was left of the sardine when he had
done with it. When the Waterwitch sailed
they got busy digging into the whale’s
stomach, and though the animal was mighty
high by this time they stuck to it till they
hauled out a mass of ambergris weighing in
the rough 1801 b. At this time the market
was bare of the substance and it was fetch-
ing £ll per oz. in London. The bottom
nearly fell out of the market and ambergris
slumped to £4 per oz. when this heap came.
in; but it was sold a bit at a time, and
altogether the two finders whacked over
£lO,OOO.

“Dry Shave” : Five jobs will need attend-
ing to before the china and porcelain dreams
of “Croson” (B. 13/1/16) can be realised.
(1) Hughes, Tudor and co. will need to give
us a tariff. (2) The potter’s fine arts will
have to be taught at the technical schools.
(3) Good formulas for mixing hard china
“bodies” that won’t “craze” or crack in the
glaze will need to be got from somewhere.
(4) Suitable raw materials will have to be
located on the premises. At present, fine
China clay, Swedish felspar, and Cornish
stone and flint are dragged here, the last two
being used even in those insulators of which
Victorians are so proud. (5) Works for
making colors and glazes and raw-material
refineries will have to be established. Even
kaolin, of which there are deposits in Aus-
tralia, makes a world’s tour to get the neces-
sary refinement. Through one or all of these
details being missing, the largest firm of
toilet-ware makers in Australia closed down
its works 12 months ago, and filled its orders
from the other side of the globe. Meanwhile
Fujiyama glows with the fires of potteries
and glasshouses turning out the cheap china
that Fritz used to dump on us, and the glass
on which he trod w r hen he crashed into Bel-
gium.

“Te Babarantiko” : Is it possible that the
authorities and the public are aware of the
kind of agreement that men in this Common-
wealth are asked to sign before going to a
job on some (probably most) of the Pacific
manure islands? The agreement reads like
an unpleasant joke. Some of the clauses:—
5. He shall pay ten pounds to the company to
cover his return passage to Australia.
10. The company reserves the right of dismissing
the employee without notice in case of any miscon-
duct, disobedience of orders, insubordination or breach
of agreement.
12. The employee shall work during such hours as
the company’s representative shall direct, and full
power is reserved to alter the hours of labor.
13. No work is usually carried on on Saturday
afternoon, Sunday, Good Friday, Christmas Day, New
Year’s Day or the King’s Birthday, but no other
holidays as existing in Australia or elsewhere are
recognised. In case of necessity, as the visit or
departure of a vessel, the employee shall render such
assistance as the company’s representative may at
any time require.
17. The rules and regulations of the company,
together with any additions to or modifications of
the same, form part of this agreement.
Under clause 12 the position may easily
become intolerable to the staff, yet for dis-
obeying the employee may suffer instant dis-
missal under clause 10. The sweet reason-
ableness of clause 17 makes me want to know
what can be done about it.
“Murkah” : Prices of photographic chemi-
cals have bounded up since the outbreak of
war, and some goods are unprocurable at
any price. This seems like a chance for an
Australian industry to get firmly on its legs.
Even in pre-war days at least two works
were learning to toddle —one at Abbotsford
(Melb.) and one in Sydney. But the fact
that, after 17 months, Australia is unable to
fully supply the local demands, suggests that
someone must be waiting for Mans to step
in and oblige once more. And you can bet
your life he will do this immediately after
the war —unless somebody softly closes the
gate, and the chance of that doesn’t look
more than 100 to 1.
ANOTHER GERMAN ATROCITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The keeper of a delicatessen shop in Melbourne,
opening his place of business the other morning,
found his stock pulled down, tramped upon, and
scattered all about the place. Many edible articles
had disappeared. The depredation is supposed to be
the work of small boys. We have other suspicions.
The German sausage played his role
With just a stifled sneeze,
And from its musty lair there stole
A grim Limburger cheese.
He whispered to the Frankfurts: “Ach!
Der time ad lasd iss come,”
And took a knife from off the rack,
And fetched the French beans such a crack
The herrings beat their drum
(True Britons they from Yarmouth bay)
And eagerly rushed to the fray.
The Frankfurts threw themselves upon
Italian pickled eels;
Vienna rolls took part anon,
And with impassioned squeals
The stout York ham assailed the cheese,
And broke its craven crust;
The scarlet runners charged the peas
Preserved in Saxony, and these
Went rolling in the dust,
While German pickles turned like imps
On gay Parisian potted shrimps.
The fierce French mustard dashed itself
Upon the blutwurst grim,
The tough spaghetti from a shelf
In cohorts pale and slim
Wound down to meet the hated Huns;
Tinned lobster from Japan
Attacked the kraut, and local buns
Fell on the staler Berlin ones,
And so the row began.
It proves that short of bar and lock
You cannot trust the German stock.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
nsh, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are l°o severe on the enamel.

opfiocnhle” nuts down his bundle of secret
history. ,
one of the hidden curiosities of the earl.i tage.
f the war was an attempt to spirit Pope Benedict
av vay from Rome to Spain. The plot was planned
hr Sehombourg-Hartenstein, Austrian ambassador to
(he Pope, with the connivance of his Emperor, the
• „„ and the King of Spain. When the Italian
Government renounced the Triple Alliance Kaiser
■ nd Emperor informed King Alfonso that war was
Evitable, and that the Pope would be in danger,
fj-fjev suggested Spain as a refuge, and Alfonso
heartily concurred. The Spanish Episcopate inv.ted
the Pope, and the news somehow leaked out. The
influential English, French, Belgians, Russians and,
above all, the Italians at once assured the Pope
that it was all humbug, and he would not be in the
slightest danger. They also pointed out that his sug-
gested departure was a snare set to catch him. The
Italian Government gave an absolute assurance of
safety. However, the Austrian ambassador went on
with the secret preparations, supported by Monsignor
Caeszarik, ecclesiastical counsellor of the Embassy.
Two large tourist motor-cars were obtained from
Vienna, with two others for the Papal effects.
(hauffeurs understanding neither Italian nor French
were obtained from Bucharest. The start would be
from Rome to Gaeta ; thence the Pope was to pro-
eeed from Gaeta to Spain by a large Spanish Trans-
atlantic steamer, escorted by a Spanish cruiser. He
would be taken to Valencia. But it was all capsized
In- Pope Benedict’s firm determination not to be
stampeded. So the world did not get a chance to
lnngh at the spectacle of an elderly cleric needlessly
flying from home in four irreligious motor-cars.
“Yellow Flush”: If “Jeames” weren’t, as
I understand at the Front, Spencer Fon-
Lby Fane, dead in London at 91, would
have set him reminiscing for half a column,
n.ne t>ei '* f f
I-ane was t “ , , G ... l , ’ 'inci’nle
course, on the ruinous oici rsiiusn pnneipie,
something good had to be found for him.
PaTmerston took him on as I’m ate Seere-
ary and then he was made Comptroller of
Accounts in the Lord Chamberlain's depart-
fnent There he showed a real genius for
management and ceremonial, and from the
wedding of the Frincess Royal (the Kaiser’s
mother) onwards he stage-managed all
the Royal circuses. Lord Chamberlains
came and went; but Fane was the
real L.C. all the time. At least one
of them resigned in disgust; and The
Rulletin’s old friend Carrington was
about the only man of them who
could repress him. Fane was said to be the
only person after Disraeli died (1881) who
could tell Queen Victoria what was good for
her. He suggested various excellent reforms
in other people’s departments, and earned
all the dislike which every Court feels for any
reformer; but that didn’t worry him a bit.
From 1840 to 1901 he was that sort of auto-
crat, and then King Edward came in, and
—probably in memory of many difficult
moments in the past—he promptly “retired”
the capable, bullying veteran. Fane said
his heart was broken. Here was a corona-
turn to manage—the one thing he had never
b een a j,j e to try i ds i, and at . atid j le was
ou t if- However, lie outlived his royal
master, though having a disadvantage of 17
years in age.
The difforent points of view
McKenna (Chancellor of the British Exchequer):
Everyone ought to save every shilling he can. We
must keep down the flow of imports.
Almost any Australian politician: Spend, spend,
spend, ai d borrow more to buy further piles of stuff
from foreign countries.
Now which is right — the man who shudders
at de bt or the one who jumps into it with
three cheers?

R ; : Bendigo and Ballarat tram cos. are
owned chiefly in Liverpool (Eng.), and,
especially since the war began, the Ans-
tralian-born employees are comparatively
few. A theatrical company that played at
Ballarat recently was so impressed with the
number of immigrant conductors and motor-
men that it decided to test them systemati-
cally. “I say, conductor,” said the stage-
villain. “Does this train go to Lake Wen-
douree?” “00, aye,” replied the conductor.
“Ye’ll be at the lake wi’in til’ half-’oor.” lie
t pied half a dozen of them, and the answers
we re in the tongue of the Tyke, or the Cock-
ney, or of men from beyond the Clyde. Then
he as ked if there were no Australians left in
the service, and was told they had been re-
placed “since the warr starrted.” More of
the charming fairness of the voluntary sys-
tem. which sends the willing Australian to
fight and allows the cold-footed immigrant to
sneak in and collar his job !
Cabled that while Chaplain J. R. Stewart
was conducting the funeral service of sol-
diers fallen in Flanders, a shell burst over
the grave, killing the parson and wounding
? eve ™l bystanders Stewart was well known
ia Sydney, .where he was trained for the
Anglican ministry at Moore College. He
fad recently been a missionary in China
but was in England on holiday when Bill

Paul Joseph, a popular young Congrega-
tional parson, who ran up against a fortune
a short while ago, has hit upon an idea. It is
going to be three storeys high on North Ter-
race, near Adelaide Exhibition. The church
wall be on the first floor and the choir is to
be paced by an orchestra. Class-rooms ‘and
concert-rooms are on order for the ground
floor, and other minor details to be added
above are billiard-room, ladies’ reading-room,
men’s reading-room, smoke-room and bar
(soft tack). The idea seems to be to pluck
the brand from the burning in the snooker
department, and hurry it through the bar
into a front pew. It will be all ready in
six months.
“Allons”: Two years before war broke
out the French Geographical Society fitted
out an expedition for a four years’ cruise
to explore the oceans of the world. A small
band of eight, sailed in the yacht La
Curieuse, and in October, 1914, she reached
Sydney. The party was there amazed to hear
that France was engaged in deadly combat,
and, though exempt from service, the whole
boiling rushed to their consulate and signed
ou for the fray. The Commandant, Du
Baty, a man of the highest attainments, has
been killed ; the yacht’s mate has been
wounded ; of the rest of the party there is*
no news. The N. S. Wales Government has
taken over the little ship as a sacred charge,
and Sydney’s Sunday holiday-making young
man can view her at his leisure as she lies
proudly floating the beloved tri-color above
the bobbing dead marines on the waters of
, tj 3- ',’. , , . , , ... ,
A British ship, laden with rock salt,
reached Port Jackson last week in charge
of a skipper who appears to be a wag of a
kind. He broke the news to one daily paper
reporter that he was afraid his cargo was
on fire. When the eager young man asked
for particulars the captain explained that a
lambent blue flame was playing over the
rock salt, and as he feared spontaneous com-
bustion he was going to dump the salt into
Neutral Bay. This interesting item duly
appeared, and the “old man” was still enjoy-
ing his funny story when he was stormed by
a procession of stevedores, underwriters,
Harbor Trust officers, fire fighters, marine
inspectors, water police and sundries,
all anxious to do their bit in grappling with
the situation. The skipper had to take a
day off to explain it, and the explanation
seemed satisfactory to nobody.
“Petifi” on economy and keeping the
money in the country and other absurdities:
The Defence Department wants 2770 sets of
oblong-tent poles. They must be straight-grained
Oregon pine. Also, a number of bell-tent poles are
wanted, and they must be Oregon, too. But poles
for operating tents, which the Department also
wants, may be maple, or gum, or any other old Aus.
tralian timber. Now, if the Australian vegetable
is good enough to support an operating-tent, what
disqualifies it from being the sole support of Bill-
j ini’s bit of calico? Is it graft or is it sheer
stupidity ? People should know and Pearce is the
man who should tell them. The latest word from
Pearce was that “tenders are to be re-invited and

DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS IN

and as a result of
experience the one

Indian Root Pills as a genuine medicine for
the relief of Constipation and Biliousness,'’
writes Mrs. Emily Clarke, of Elphinstone
Street, Ravenswood, Q., “and. strange to say.
some years ago I was also advised by a lady
on board a steamer coming from Rockhamp-
ton to try your remedy for those ailments,

properties that I have no hesitation in doing

POLITICAL
POINTS
If they think at all, which thej’ probably
don’t, the people who are shrieking for “con-
scription of wealth’’ and “loans without in-
terest” might consider the case of the life
insurance offices which have been easily the
largest contributors to the war loans. The
M.L.C. and the A.M.P., which between them
have subscribed just upon four millions to
the two loans, really have no wealth at all.
They certainly show a tremendous amount
on their balance-sheets ; but they owe it all
A DIGNIFIED REBUKE.

of you I should say you should sign the

nor a politician.”
to somebody. They no more own the mil-
lions that figure in their accounts than a
trustee owns the money left in his hands
It might seem a fine thing to be able to say
to these offices, “You must let us have 20
millions without interest.” “Very well,” the
offices would say, “we don’t mind a bit—so
long as you relieve us of our contracts with
cur hundreds of thousands of policy-holders.
It’s their money, not ours.”
<i. Reid goes on shedding the ulleged prin-
ciples of a lifetime with a rapidity astonish-
ing even in one so agile. “We are all com-
p unionists in the ruthless democracy of
Australia,” he now shouts triumphantly.
Yes, but no thanks to G. 11. Reid. Every-
one with any sort of memory will recollect
how, when Alfred Deakin was telling this
country of the necessity for compulsory mili-
tary training, Reid delivered shocked orations
declaring that the idea was “un-English”
and threatened to saddle this country with
“the worst form of Continental conscrip-
tion” ! A day or so after his Commons
debut, Reid, under the influence of a large
dinner given him by some business men, re-
nounced his discredited fiscal theories by
hollering that at a time like this Freetrade
“goes like a flash.” God made George’s
principles of jelly so that they wouldn’t hurt
his digestion.
THE CRUCIBLE.
Fiscal theories will have to go into the melting-
pot when the war is over, along with all other pre-
conceived ideas of Imperial policy.
—Sydney Daily Telegraph.
Apropos this excuse of one brand of
shirker that he will support conscription of
men when there is conscription of wealth.
Here are the figures showing the income tax
paid by the Sulphide Corporation, a Broken
Ilill-Newcastle eo., during the past three
jears: 1913, £7660; 1914, £22,154; 1915,
£96,004. Perhaps that isn’t “conscription
or wealth,” but it is a remarkably good sub-
stitute.
Underwood, Labor M.L.A., has been
telling YV estralian union men a few home
truths. The other night, at a Perth Labor
meeting, he pointed out that unionism was
being misused, in that men made it the
means of promoting the right to loaf rather
than of obtaining a good day’s pay for a
good day’s work. It is painfully true. The
general idea seems to be: “We put the
into power, and now they’ll have to give us
a good time,” regardless of the fact that no
country can go on consuming more than it
produces that the less the community digs
up the less there will be to divide presently
Underwood had the patriotism and courage
to declare the position in unmistakable lan-
guage, and the honest Labor man will thank
him for it.
Acting-Premier Cann (N.S.W.) has spent
the- greater part of the last fortnight
explaining what a magnificent thing it is
for the Government to pay the Norton Grif-
fiths syndicate 5 per cent, on £14.000,000
worth of public works, ostensibly for super-
vision, though the salaries of the officers
d0 m t , he supervising are paid bv the
fetate. Ihe amazing thing is that the little
group of members of Parliament who per-
suaded the representative of Norton Grif-

The common-sense Labor Government of
8 Alls, has smashed another time-and money-
wasting precedent. Port Augusra wanted
to send the tislial deputation to make the
usual strong representations about its wTater-
supply. ‘'All right, but why go to the
trouble and expense of a 250-mile journey
each way?” the Minister asked. So he sat
at a telephone in Adelaide, a member of the
State Parliament looked in and “introduced”
the parties, and, that formality vver, there
were no others. The rest of the argument
was conducted over the wire.
Hearken to Freetrade, finding comfort in
present war-conditions among the Huns: —
Germany is now the most highly-protected and is
absolutely the most self-contained country in the
world, yet it is neither prosperous nor happy.
It is the Argus cackling, and there should
be a bright future ahead of the brain which
has been able to discover, in Germany’s com-
paratively unfrazzled state after IS months
of hard fighting anu war attrition, an argu-
ment against Protection. With the naval
position reversed and Protectionist Germany
effectively blockading Britain, British Free-
trade would be gnawing the soles off its
boots inside six months.
Someone in the Defence Department wmke
up the other day to a horrible suspicion that
somebody else in the same service is either
a dreadful ass or a worse rogue. No one
seems to know how big the swag has been,
but it must have been fairly bulky after
such a long raid. Among other things
discovered at • one centre was that stuff
which could be purchased from suburban
chemists at 2s. 6d. per gallon was being
supplied to the army wholesale at 255., while
something else for which 13s. Gd. per gallon
was a good price had been regularly wheeled
in at 755. Also it is found that there is
a great shortage of everything wanted until
it is ordered, and then it materialises
promptly, accompanied by an adequate in-
voice. Long ago foolish people who had
suspicions urged Pearce to remember that
a million was a lot of money to spend every
week, and that the services of a few dozen
reliable bulldogs to keep one eye on P. Enter-
prise and the other on the cashbox would
be worth having. They are needed now as
much as ever.
A young law-clerk named Parker, articled
tc Joe Woolf, the Melbourne soLcitor who
does a lot of legal work for the unions, was
chosen some time ago by the Prahran branch
(f the Political Labor Council to oppose
Donald Mackinnon, M.L.A., at the next elec-
tion. The candidate who came second was
W H. Webber, who has contested the Prah-
ran seat previously; and George Mead, a
teacher at Wesley College, was fourth.
Parker’s selection was a surprise to most;
and the usual bitterness ensued. Presently
the local P.L.C. committee got wind of an

(1) that, on ac-

A friend of Kink O’Malley reckons the
Northern Territory can be fixed up—yew
bet! —if the Commonwealth Government
gives him a billet and arranges for handing
a Yankee shyndikit the necessary conces-
sions. _ The matter is quite simple. All
that it is necessary to do is to find
£6U,000,000, trap the Purari River in Papua,
import the water through gigantic pipes to
Centralia, and, having established an inland
sea, allow the' liquid to swosh all over the
backyard. The Kink has handed his
friend and the scheme over to Brother
Mahon with a remark that “something like
this will enshrine your name among the
immortals.” The next thing for Mahon to
do is to call for a reDort or appoint a Royal
Commission and go into the whole matter
for 17 years, by which time, of course, the
Territory will. be in the same place, unless
Gilruth cuts it off the top and brings it
round to Melbourne for investigation by
experts.
On January 31, just 26 years after the
line was opened, the very last of Melbourne’s
dilapidated horse-trams disappeared from
the landscape, the Hawthorn line being
about to be electrified and extended to Bur-
vood. The dreadful arks never paid, yet
the monopolistic company coolly demanded,
and got, £5OO as compensation for relin-
quishing the last four years of its unprofit- j
able contract —another reminder of the pit '
which States and municipalities dig for i
themselves when they hand public services ;
over to the tender mercies of benevolent- j
looking Private Enterprise.
. ictoria’s Government begins to feel the f
pinch, and is cutting down railway expendi-
ture. New proposals are given the glassy i
eye and the half-finished duplications of the j
suburban lines in preparation for electrifi- '
ion° n are s^. u *- This means that about
1000 men will be released for other work,
but—‘‘the Government has no disposition to
go in for drastic retrenchment.” This is !
very consoling, because there was a sus-
picion that it might sack the State Excel- I
lency, close up Government House and Cot- j
tage, abolish the expensive House of Fat j
and even scuffle along without Parliamen- ;
tary picnics. It is a great comfort to know
that the tall poppies are left till last; they
are so ornamental.
THE STRONG ARM OF THE WOODROW STATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am afraid of being unready to perform my duty ;
afraid of the danger, the shame and the inadequacy.
—Woodrow Wilson.
Get ready! Any day the call may come,
The pleasant Notes of peace begin to fail.
It may be needful soon to sound the drum,
And furbish up our arms and rusted mail,
Though once too proud to fight, the world may see
The strength of our new-born humility.
Get ready ! Ho, Chicago ! Leap to arms
With all thy weight of pork to nerve thy blow 1
Pittsburg, awake! The sky with wild alarms
Is shaken at the menace of the foe.
We wrote them fair with an untiring pen.
Ink fails. In hot-leashed wrath we speak as men.
How shall we smite them if the die is cast?
Lo, five-score thousands answer to the call.
The broad resources of our land are vast,
' Edged with the weight of doom our blow should
fall;
Yet, in the grim world-battle’s awful length,
One pinprick represents our fighting strength.
With time to arm, the terror of our might
Would shake the corners of the living world;
But who will stay the onrush of the fight,
And pause till that loud lightning stroke is hurled,
Which with the hot speed of devotion rare
Will take at least a twelvemonth to prepare?
Get ready! War is war! But fire and steel
Speak net the last word in the restless strife.
Smite with the dollar, rend them with the wheel,
Use our tremendous credit like a knife;
The larger weapons of our skill devise
To break the battle-front of force and lies.
Our murdered ghosts across the water glide.
_ Break up the cash-bos with a valorous hand 1
Keep humble and forget our peaceful pride;
The many-millioned cheques for honor stand.
Push with embattled gold, for swiftest so
May we hand wallop to a bankrupt foe!

NOTIONS
“Tekelo”-: It was W. Scott (“Scotty,” who
used to play wing for St. Kilda), of the third
brigade, who lay wounded a few hours after the
landing at Gaba Tepe. Said he: “Aren’t there any
blanky doctors here that can get a couple of
bullets out of a bloke’s shoulder, so that he can have
a go at the cows again?” Alas, that little parcel of
Australian pluck lies dead in Gallipoli!
* * # *
When Frank O’Connor and the English
welter, Fred Delaney, argued the point at Melbourne
a few weeks ago, O’Connor started by landing heavily
on the visitor’s jaw and so shaking him that, until
he was woodened out in the fifth, Delaney had only'
a hazy notion of what was going on. When they
came together at Sydney Stadium on Saturday his-
tory didn’t repeat itself, and the crowd saw one of
the most strenuous battles waged between men of the
weight for many a day—a struggle in which both
men for a time showed fair skill and exceptional
speed and endurance, and one of them very fine cour-
age. O’Connor started early, and it looked as if he
might finish his man in the first round. Again, in
the second, his right came over with lightning-like
rapidity, and Delaney was badly' hurt. In the third
he was rocking on the edge, but weathered the threat-
ening disaster of a final clout. Then, battered
heavily though he had been, he commenced evening
things up, and fought back with good judgment and
effect. At in-fighting Delaney had much the best of
it. He is, too, much the better boxer, and though
up to the end of the sixth round O’Connor seemed
likely to win at any moment with his wallop, the
fight was all Delaney’s from then until the end.
O’Connor was badly punished about the face and
body, and by the opening of the tenth chapter was
clearly demoralised. While at close-quarters in this
round Delaney hit low; and as O’Connor shrank
back, Scott stopped the proceedings to give the
offender a caution. Immediately on resuming
Delaney again got below the border, and O’ConYior
going down the disturbance went no further, Scott
giving the verdict to the fallen man on a foul. The
rest was mainly clamor and boo-hoo and cheers and
loud talk. Scott was absolutely' right. He could do
nothing else.
Delaney, whose offence was apparently unwittingly
committed, had the rottenest of luck, for otherwise
it was a thousand to one on him winning, and
quickly', too. O’Connor was hanging on, tiring away
to nothing; his defence, which had been poor all
through, was rapidly breaking down, and the power
was completely gone from his punch. He didn’t even
seem to know he had a punch. Prior to the affray
he was a pronounced favorite. If he meets Delaney
again he will he the outsider. Yet though Delaney
ha? the greater skill and stamina, the result of
another collision would be mighty doubtful, for
O’Connor has a sudden and disconcerting punch in
his kit. It arrives in a fearful hurry. That is his
long suit. For the rest, his form is not of any con-
sequence. Delaney’s stand-by is his hardness, and
—compared with O’Connor, at any rate—his skill as
a boxer. The probabilities are that if they meet a
dozen times O’Connor would each time have to win
quickly by the knock or be either outed himself
later on or certainly outpointed. Saturday,'s weights:
Delaney, lOst. 71b. ; O’Connor, lOst.

Wave Geike and George Pearson were in
a hurry to get home from Melbourne, Stadium on
Saturday night, and accordingly passed Hhe mustard
round without any unnecessary politeness/ The
Bananalander spread it over Pearson’s jaw and spare
ribs with a lavish right hand, and at the eleventh
helping Pearson was satisfied.
“Cog”: Jimmy Hill is the luckiest cham-
pion Australia has ever had. His luck began when
his, fight with Joe Russell was postponed for a week
owing to wet weather. In between Russell contracted
an; illness from which he has never recovered, and
when he jumped on the scales his weight was Bst.
111 b. instead of Bst. 1341 b., his normal fighting
tonnage. Hill punched the almost defenceless Rus-
sell all round the ring, but could get only a points
decision. Since that time Hill has been defeated
by Thorn, Taylor, Ellis, Simpson and Spargo, all of
whom were under the feather limit; while Jimmy’s
good luck saw that he was over the weight, conse-
quently liis championship was not involved. The
sweetest smile of fortune was recently when, beaten
to a turn by Spargo, down and out practically, Hill
won on a technical foul. Hence, despite the fact
that he hasn’t had a dtecent win in six months, and
has had half a dozen indecent defeats, he still holds
the championship of the featherweights. Talk about
a ragtime champion! Freddie Welsh with his no-
decision contests isn't in it with Jimmy Hill.
* * * *
“E.J.C.”: What a pity it is that ex-
feather champion Joe Russell is not now fit and
well! What a scrap it would be between him and
Edwards! With both at their top Russell would
just about win. There would be as much fight in
their 20 rounds as there is in 40 rounds of the
average contest. A grand little fighter was Joey.
When at his top I saw him beat Thorn, giving the
latter 41b. weight, a feat no other man in Australia
lias done. I saw him knock out Jimmy' Hill in
eight rounds, give Charlie Simpson a boxing lesson
for 20 rounds, defeat Alf Morey and Jack Read
decisively, and fight a great 20 rounds with McCoy.
His crowning achievement was when he delighted
Brisbane enthusiasts by outpointing the brilliant
Harry Stone. That was Russell’s greatest fight.
Stone was also at his top, and a week later he out-
pointed Johnny Summers, and then went on to give
McCoy and eo. some elevating instruction. ■ McCoy
had his revenge on Russell by catching him napping
and knocking him out in 2min. 35sec. at the Sydney
Stadium. Shortly after this Russell contracted an
illness and lost the title to Hill (20 rounds). Joe
is comfortably fixed, owning several houses and
having a big share in a leading Brisbane joinery co.
“Pip”: One often wonders as he sits
watching the boxing contests at the Stadiums if the
“renowned” talent has ever had a lesson in the
science of the boxing game. Jack Johnson could
teach the hunch of them. Said he one night in
Sydney, “Keep a good position at all times; when
your opponent swings at your head, guard with the
arm; when your opponent hits straight at your
head, duck; if your opponent ducks when you hit
straight, swing at him; if your opponent guards
when you swing, strike at his body; after hitting
and getting away, return to your position as soon
as possible; when your opponent uses all kinds of
blows, work to the right and away' from him, if on
the defensive, and forward and to the right if on
the aggressive.” That’s not exactly the way he put
it, but I’ve left out no essentials.
“R.M.C.” : In B. 20/1/TG “Dalriada” has
a misstatement. He says that “Bendigo” was a
Jew pugilist. Such is not the case. Bendigo was
a Nottingham man, and lie and his forebears were
English. His correct name was William Thompson,
and he was one of triplets.

“Sardonyx”: In these days of dilettante
glove-tapping, with full minute intervals between
three-minute rounds, it is difficult to realise that
the old-time bare-knuckle battles lasted sometimes
over three solid hours and well into the second
century of rounds. And it must be remembered that
in those days a round ended only with a knock-down
or a throw; either of which happenings, though it

might supervene in a few seconds, might not, on
the other hand, arrive for 15 or 20 minutes. The
championship battle between Ward and Cannon, in
1825, numbered only 10 rounds, but it was one of
the most desperate fights on record. The day, for
one thing, was one of the hottest ever known in
England, and the men fought on a high wooden
platform, exposed, even between the rounds, to a
remorseless glare that went very near of itself to
heating them both. The punching was so severe and
continuous that by the seventh round the men were
gasping and staggering about the platform, and
in the next two they went down together the moment
they tried to wrestle. Struggling up at last for the
tenth round, they stood gaping helplessly at each
other for several minutes before Ward, with a last
effort, sent over the ghost of a hit. Cannon went
down, Ward fell on top of him, and, to all appear-
ance, both men were done-for. Dragged out of the
heat they came round after a time, though Cannon
remained for a long time at death's door.

Owing to enlistments the N. S. Wales
Lawn Tennis Association has managed to rake up only
22 teams for this season’s badge matches, as against
last year's 86. The names of some 100 players have
been handed in, and when those over the age-limit
and otherwise unfit are deducted, there won’t remain
many players who will have to dodge their recruit-
ing cards. The most notable absentee is University,
which (three cheers!) couldn’t enter a single team.
Last 3' ear 10 competed.

Anthony Wilding, although he has passed
over, is still doing his bit. At a tennis tournament
at Masterton (M.L.) recently a photograph of the
great tennis wizard, presented by his parents, was
offered at auction in aid of the Wounded Soldiers’
Fund. It brought in L 525.
The gold medal for doing all its duty at
a time when most are skiting a lot because they have
done part of it, goes to the Galashiels Trinity Rugby
toeball club in Scotland. When the Big Row started
the club had 73 members, and of these 72 have gone
to the Front. The 73rd member tried his best to go
with them, hut was twice turned back by medical
men.

London has unexpectedly seen an inter-
national Rugby match. A strong team got together
from the S’African artillerynnen training in England
was beaten, three tries to one, bv* a side including
several old internationals from various British
camps. Incidentally, Soccer in London has found, at
this unlikely time, the strongest forward seen for
years; his name is Buchan, and he gets from three
to five goals on his own each match. But wno
cares? The international game above mentioned
drew only 2000 spectators.

An Australasian and two Maoriland
records went overboard at Wellington (M.L.) a few
days back. ML G. Stead’s Sweet Corn a Malster-
Condiment filly, bolted with the Metropolitan Handi-
cap (six furlongs) in lmin. 11 l-ssec. This is three-
fifths of a second inside the previous Australasian
best, made by Charmilla at Riecarton (M.L.) in
April, 1914. The other new figures were pasted up
when Bee galloped over 11 mile of the Wellington
Cup in 2min. 31 3-ssec., and when Desert Gold con-
veyed 9st. 31b. over five furlongs in the Wellington
Stakes in 59sec. #
A beautiful English horse, with a most
unlovely disposition, is Red Dennis, who won a race
at Williamstown (Vic.) the other Monday. When
jockey Bullock called upon the fiery steed to make
an extra effort he just threw-his head and hit his
crouching rider on the nose. All the same, Red
Dennis did bestir himself until he was up alongside
the leader. Ulilus. Then his one idea was to stop
the other fellow from winning, and he finally won
the race himself bv getting his head well in front of
Ulilus’s throat, in order that he might try to bite it.
A fair fancy bet on the coming New-
market Handicap would be 2 to 1 against the batch
of imported entrants. Of these, Baronet Coopers
Redfern is alleged to be easily the fastest liorse in
Australia. But Redfern’s weight—9st. 91b. —is cal-
culated to slow the colt down. The more elderly
Cyklon seems better treated with 9st. 51b., or i Hi.
less than Traquette. Lower down on .the list Ludo-
vitch, Saracen and the pony King Marco are con-
spicuously-dangerous imported gees. There are 23
of them in the Newmarket Handicap, mostly a bit
dotty on their pins or in their temper.
All the frightfulness is not in Belgium.
An advt. in the local paper gives a hint of cruel
things done at home: —-
APOLOGY.
To Messrs. Sheldrick & Co., Brewers, Warrnambool.
We, the undersigned, hereby beg to apologise to you,

ale at the Penshurst Races, and we exceedingly
regret that we should have done anything which
might in the least affect the high reputation your

France is going to turn again to racing
this year. The Societe d’Encouragement recently
published a lengthy list of “Races to Come” in 1916,
1917, 1918 and 1919, entries for which have just
closed. That all looks as if those in high places in
France view the future with calm confidence. As was
only to be expected there is a slight decrease in the
amount offered for some of the leading events, but
all the big races are on the card. This year and
next year the French Derby will be worth 4000 sovs.
and the Grand Prix has been reduced to 8000 sovs.,
but it still remains the most valuable stake in
Europe. The Prix du Cadran drops to 3000 sovs.
One important change is that in future most Of
these races will be run on a Thursday instead of the
usual Sunday.
“Xelamo” : The question of the relative
speeds of horse and greyhound lias cropped up again
-in England. The point has been repeatedly decided in
favor of the horse. But there used to he plenty of
money behind the dog. The smaller animal, when
performing in a coursing-match, always seems to be
moving faster than is possible to a horse ; but actu-
ally it doesn’t even require a thoroughbred to out-
pace a greyhound on a straight and level road. Any
neddy with a reasonable turn of speed can do it.
The dog. with his quicker get-away, will leave the
horse a bit at first, but about a furlong will bring
him back, and at the half-mile he is clean out of it.
Over heavy going, however, the greyhound can gener-
ally hold his own, and sometimes more. Finding
they had no chance with the ordinary greyhound
the dog-backers tried the deerhound, but the money
went the same way.
Recently a horse named Roamer cut out
nine furlongs when winning the National Handicap
at Laurel, in Maryland (U.S.A.), in lmin. 50see.
This equals the Yankee and world’s record made by
Vox Populi some years back. The nearest approach
to it is the Australian record 1 of lmin. 52lsec. stand-
ing to the credit of Perkeo and Woorak. The best
time ever registered for the distance in Fogland was
when Polvmelus ran it in lmin. 52 4-ssec.

Cruelty-to-animals inspectors are on the
track of a new instrument of torture for racehorses
in Maoriland. It was used on trotters at Christchurch
(M.L.) recently, and consists of a strong steel wire
that can be attached, to the nag’s ear by a clip, the
other end of the wire being held by the driver. By
turning the wire in his hand the pilot can twist the
prad’s ear, which besides being a hint to hurry is
said to prevent the animal from “breaking” when
being pushed, Some drivers curse the device as
brutal, but others declare it is far from being so.
In fact, a prominent vet. has expressed the opinion
that the device does not inflict pain ; but prominent
people have a habit of expressing all kinds of
opinions. Anyhow, inspectors have been instructed
to get busy at forthcoming trotting meetings, and an
animal known as Costs was lic-king his lips in antici-
pation when the mail left.
A performance out of the common was put
up by a lad named Porter, who rode five winners at
Ascot (Sydney) course last Saturday. He also in-
duced a prad to pass the judge second. There were
nine events on the card, and three of Porter’s wins
were consecutive, commencing with the first race.
Fred Lindrum hopes to take on McCon-
achie, the Maoriland billiard champion, in Mel-
bourne next May. Mac, who is a boy of 20, has
made many big breaks—off the red, ‘ mostly. His
highest to date is 1083. He scores rapidly and is
an exceptionally graceful cueist. With football
“queered” by the war, the gentle game of billiards
will probably boom for show purposes this next
winter.
“Cue-Ball”: Death of billiardist W. A.
Lovejoy recalls a wrangle he had with that past-
master of chin-music, Melbourne Inman. They
were playing a match, and Inman talked and
finessed so that he got Lovejoy fairly ropable. Now,
Lovejoy, who was tall and as thin as a ladder, was
also a bit of a dabster in the gentle art of riling, so
he meandered into the billiard-room the following
session carrying a tall chair. He was in plav, and
the red ball was hanging over the centre pocket.
Sitting on the chair and with one foot on the floor
Lovejoy commenced to “tickle the tomato.” After
a few strokes Inman protested. The referee stopped
play, and the point was argued. Lovejov pointed
out that the rules said nothing about chairs being
bgrred, hut that one foot must he placed on the
ground in making a stroke. He won the tongue-
fight. For once, in a way, the “Twickenham Terrier”
had been got at, but he won the game.

“Nyren” : Interesting to learn that S. 11.
Pardon, editor of John Wisden’s Cricketers’ Al-
manack, considers the late Victor Trumper the
greatest of all Australian batsmen. Australian
critics have had no doubts on the matter, and not
a few of them think he was the most gifted batsman in
the world of this or any other period. He did not
play as long as several of the old-world champions,
nor did he have so many opportunities of adding to
his fame, but for ease, grace, brilliance and multi-
plicity of stroke, on all kinds of wicket, Trumper
was incomparable. Certainly no batsman, English
or Australian, has' proved such a magnet to the
public, who are not bad judges. But Australians take
off their hats to the late “W.G.” as being the greatest
cricketer—as differentiated from batsman—that ever
lived.
* » * *
“G.N.” : In reply to “Mill” (B. 3/2/TO),
herewith two entries for the spectacular catch com-
petition. First, Vic. Trumpet. In a test on Syd-
nev Cricket Ground Tom Hayward jumped in to
drive, miss-eued, and the ball curled un af™; i
behind the bowler. Vic, who was in the lone
just in front of the southern sight-board, set off t
cover the intervening space under evens and i 2
managed to get his extended right hand’ under of
ball before curling head under heels. The seonni
incident occurred on the same field in another t«t
when “Ranji” brought off a wonderful left-hanrwi
catch at point from a terrific square cut by a hat
man who, by his actions as he slowly moved' pavilion
wards, seemed the most surprised man on earth
since Adam returned home to Eden one evening ani
found the footstep of man Friday on the beach.
“First Slip”: Most spectacular catch’
My vote for that of W. J. Scott, ex-Victorian which
dismissed Syd Gregory, of Sydney, in an inter-State
match some years ago. The fieldsman sprinted at
least 30 yards to a fairly low and fast off-drive and
brought off a beautifully-judged left-handed catch
right on the fence. Scott was in his time the fast
est man playing League football, but that was no
satisfaction to Gregory.

Sydney amateur cyclist G. A. Ilalpin has
been busy lately. At the A.N.A. meeting at Mel-
bourne he won the half-hour race (with Massie) and
also picked up the half-mile handicap from scratch
In a heat of the latter event Halpin flew over the
track in 54 3-ssec„ which upsets McDoiigall’s world's
amateur competition record of 55see. Returning to
Sydney, the flier won a five-mile scratch race and
was second in a half-mile handicap.
Yankee speed-monger Erwin G. Baker
had another go at the world’s motor-bike road records
on the Mortlake-Terang (Vic.) circuit on January 29,
and succeeded in capsizing those for 12, 18 and 24
hours, with tallies of 676, 876 and 1027 miles re-
spectively. He had good roads and better luck until
he had covered 981 miles ; then a small valve trouble
lost him 13 minutes; and in the 31st lap, when he
had been riding 21hrs. 32min., the continuous vibra-
tion fractured his oil-tank and the show was over.
If all had gone well he must have easily smashed
the world’s track record of 1054 miles.
The final meeting of the Yankee motor-
racing season on the wonderful wooden track at
Sheepshead Bay, Noo Yark, produced something
special in the shape of velocity. Resta, the wonder
of the motoring world just now, raged over the
100-miles from a flying start in 56min. 50.75ec.,
which works out at 105.39 miles per hour. This
is a new record for Wilson’s Country and brings
Resta to within 26sec. of the world’s best. But the
most exciting events were two heats of four miles
and six miles each between De Palma on a Sun-
beam and Burman on a Benz. Never more than two
lengths separated the cars, and in each race they
crossed the line with the front wheel of the Benz
alongside the back wheel of the Sunbeam. The
times were sultry—lll.97 miles an hour in the
shorter event and 113.86 miles an hour in the six-
mile sprint. It begins to look as if a two-miles-a-
minute gait will soon be the hurry-up pace for
motors.

The Ford Motor Co. of Canada has estab-
lished the extent of its connection with Ford of
Detroit (U.S.A.), the crank who would end the war
by stopping American loans to Britain. The cars
from Canada were prohibited by Defence Minister
Pearce on the strength of a cable from the Canadian
Premier, who had muddled up the facts of the case.
Having made a misstatement Premier Borden with-
drew it in a slow, dignified manner. It isn’t poli-
ties to own up to an error in a hurry. Last week,
however, Pearce got the official admission that Ford
the Peace crank has only a 25 per cent, interest in
the Canadian co., which has given men and money
to the British forces, and has consigned its crazy
godfather to Gehenna, in a Canadian way of speak-
ing.
American papers announce that a motor-
boat has been built to run the coveted “mile a
minute.” The craft is named Disturber IV. Three
watches timed her over half a mile inside 30sec.
She did it six times running over the measured dis-
tance. The freak is kicked along by 1800-h.p.
Exit last week Gunga Bralim. the Sikh
wrestler, at Koroit (Vic.). He travelled with But-
tan Singh, and both were eaten up in quick time bv
Hackenschmidt at the Exhibition Budding, Mel-
bourne. Another eventful appearance of Brahm’s
was against Clarence Weber (also in Melbourne);
that time, in consequence of the tactics of the Indian,
the crowd chased him into the wilderness.

“ J.D.”: Is the war affecting our lady, as
well as the men, athletes ? When Fanny Durack
won the 50yds. N. S. Wales championship at Sydney
the other day by a touch from her persistent rival,
Mina Wylie, the time 30 l-ssec., was 3 l-ssec. out-
side Fanny’s world’s record. Later on the champion
won an inter-club 100yds. handicap from scratch
in lmin. 9sec., three seconds outside the worlds
record. Perhaps Miss Fanny will give the record a
shock on February 12 and 16, when the Australian
championships will be decided at Sydney.

“T.J.G.”: The beach at Port Douglas
(N.Q.), mentioned by “Will G. Buck” (B. 2/12/15)
as one of the finest in Australia, can be equalled it
not excelled by Yeppoon (Central Q.). The stretch
of sand is 14 miles long, and at low tide is as flat
as a billiard-table and nearly as hard. The local
racing club bolds meetings on it, and it is also
used as a training ground by horse-owners previous
to a meeting. The . beach is an ideal spot toi
motor-hogs and cyclists, and as a surfing resort it is
One of the best and safest along the fringe of tne
continent. I have never heard of any fatalities there.

With joy I marked how both her knees
Were dimpled very sweetly;
Her ankles, those twin esetasies,
Were slight, and fashioned neatly.
I’d never dreamt (I am a man
Demure and unobserving)
Her hips were drawn on such a plan,
So gloriously curving.
Her legs!....let language blink, engrossed
By' ardent cogitations!
Her bust revealed outshone my most
Devout anticipations!
How did I come to see a sight
So wonderfully winning?
It was not on my bridal night,
Nor was I wildly sinning. ■
I had not turned aside to tell
Her fibs the most horrific,
Nor met her in a large hotel
Beside the blue Pacific.
No, faith, I never stoop to teach
Slim maids pernicious knowledge.
I saw her surfing on the beach
By' St. Belinda’s College.

A new point was put before Judge Scholes
at Bathurst (N.S.VV.) by two men who had
been sentenced by a magistrate to three
months’ gaol for selling tickets in an un-
lawful game. They appealed against this
conviction on the ground that no purchaser
of a ticket had the remotest chance of win-
ning anything, as there was nothing for him
to draw but a blank, and as the element of
chance was thus absent the offence did not
come within the meaning of the section of
the Gaming Act under which they were
charged. Scholes, after a prolonged think,
decided against the appellants, holding (it
seemed) that any man who bought a ticket
had at least one chance —Buckley’s. But
he reduced the sentence to a month’s hard,
all the same.

To those who are troubled with sore, tender,
aching, swollen, perspiring, unpleasant smelling
feet bunions, corns or hard skin, “BIFF” will
bring quick relief and gladness to the feet. Use
“BIFF” todav and banish all pain and discomfit.
By using “BIFF” once a week you will insure
your feet against all foot troubles. “biFF” is a
scientific compound which draws out all poisonous
matter from the feet, which clog and choke pores
of the skin. One application of this unique com-
pound will render the feet sweet and antiseptic.
Its delightful results must be experienced to be
believed.
MRS. CARTER WRITES For years my feet
gave me much trouble. It was purgatory to
have to walk far, but after using one box of
“Biff” I can walk with perfect ease and com-
fort, there is nothing to compare with your
preparation for foot trouble.”
"Biff” can be obtained through all chemists and
stores ; if not in stock send direct to the manu-
facturers. Price Is. 6d. per box, or triple size box
4s (triple box contains three times the Is. 6d. size).

Have You a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your Anger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Perhaps
your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be disi olored. The disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power to walk. You may have attended
hospitals and been told your case is hopeless,
or advisdd to submit to amputation, but do
not. Try the great British Remedy:—

George Titheradge had a little story for
smoke socials relating to the conversion of a
naughty girl. lie was told that she was
testifying nightly at Salv’army meetings, and
ascribing her accession of grace to him —
George. One Sunday night he went to hear
all about it. He couldn’t have chosen a
worse time. The woman was orating on the
platform; she seemed very earnest, and ex-
plained that it was the work of the great
and good George Titheradge in that beauti-
ful play, “The Village Priest,” that had won
her from her manifold sins and wickednesses.
“I saw the miracle!” she cried—“ George
Titheradge’s miracle, and grace came to me.
Mr. Titheradge called for a manifestation of
the spirit, and the light fell on the Bible and
the leaves turned, and I was saved. God bless
George Titheradge, I say !” “At this point,”
the actor explained, “when I was feeling very
good, a nasty, harsh, derisive voice from the
other side of the hall yapped : ‘Titheradge be
blowed! It’s my miracle—l pull the
string 1’ ” It was a vulgar stage assistant
who spoke, and Titheradge departed dis-
possessed.
“S.S.”: Everybody knows that George
Musgrove’s first night with “The Belle of New
York” was one of the most trying of his life.
The gallery was furiously antagonistic, and
did its devilish best to snout the show. What
is not generally knowuvis that George Mus-
grove liad one of the rowdiest of the rowdy
eleinent picked out .and brought to his office.
“See here,” said the^distracted manager, “tell
me who paid you to raise ll—l here to-night,
and I'll make it worth your while.” “I
wasn’t paid; I’m doin’ it fer love,” said the
tough, a notorious Nicholson-street bludger.
JMusgrove wouldn’t believe it. “You can’t
tell me,” he said, “that you come here on
your own to bulldoze a bright show that
never did you any harm.” “Well,” said the
bludger. “I’ll tell yeh the Gor’struth. I’m a
member iv the Salvation Army, and the show
runs agin me religious principles.”
“Kaniva”: Edward Lyons has just gone
out of what music there is in Melbourne.
Coming here in ISB2 he was at once en-
gaged by Williamson and Musgrove for their
opera season, his instrument being the clari-
onet, which he was an unrivalled per-
former ; and he taught the Melbourne Con-
servatorium of Music how to tootle on it.
In 18S6 he opened a musical-instrument
store, and so made the name of Lyons known
in many a parlor where the young man calls
to see Polly on Sunday afternoon.
“Copy Boy”: The Bailey-Grant-Duggan
firm has on hand an uncompleted play by
the late Jack Ramsay, who did bright work
for The Bulletin and other papers, and
at the time of his death, a few months back,
was on the staff of Sydney Sun. Ramsay
intended that his. drama should be a four-
acter, but he had written only three acts
(which, by the way, read excellently) when
he had to hurry off to keep his last assign-
ment. Bert Bailey, with the help of Monty
Grover and other Sydney pressmen, is at
work on the fourth act now. and when
completed the play will be staged. It will
probably be called “The Bushwhackers.”
“O. Blin” : Even Barney Shaw is not im-
mune from Hun barbarity. A while back
Ihe great man despatched the MSS. of a
new play by the Arabic to Noo Yark. When
the effusion was sunk Barney had a fresh
copy made and sent it by the unlucky Hes-
perian. After the second burial at sea,
Shaw forwarded a strong Note to Berlin
threatening the rupture of diplomatic rela-
tions. To this the Kaiser has since replied
deeply regretting the outrages and mention-
ing that his instructions to his officers did
not include the torpedoing of penny-a-liners.
Clem Wakefield, who years ago was with
the Broughs and George Rignold in these
parts, is these days Gunner Wakefield, 558,
R.G.A., Wessex, and at latest, after 12
months’ service, was in hospital at Wat-
ford, Unfits, with an injured wing.
“Rye Dry”: The historic Tivoli of Adel-
aide, once Garner’s Rooms, is being rebuilt
for the Fuller firm. As the Bijou it brings
back pleasant recollections of Tommy Hud-
son’s Surprise Party and Harry Shine.
Harry Rickards took it over, made altera-
tions/and called it the New Tivoli. _ His
first star was Ludwig Amann, an imper-
sonator who featured an impersonation of
Baden-Powell. Rickards himself appeared
on the opening night only. Vaudeville was
not then the rapid thing it has since become.
Audiences had to wait a long while for
changes of bill. Pope and Sayles did a
season of six solemn months; Neva Carr
Glynn sang her songs for 10 weeks; Howard
Chambers and Fanny Powers lasted a
quarter of a year. Even Marie Lloyd kept
singing for three weeks at a stretch. The
Tivoli has the distinction of having housed a
juggler who was subsequently hanged, though
not by the audience. Walter Sandford.
Brandon Cremer, Mabel Ilardinge and
George Stevenson are among those who leased
the Tivoli from Rickards when he got tired
of trying to lift arcadian Adelaide taste to
the higher levels. Architect White, who re-
built the Sydney Adelphi. is undertaking the
job of making the old place new.
MUSIC AT SEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Night, the moon and the sea
And the far, faint Barcarolle
Throbbing its grief to me
And winds that blow from the Pole!
Sadness drips from the strings
And death looks down from above
As harp to violin sings
The end of all earthly love.
Night, the moon and the sea!
How faint and thin are the strings
In this immensity!
Now lover to lover clings.
Courage, O fainting Heart!
"Tis a fevered brain that raves,
For we can never part
The music drowns in the waves.

John McP.: Now tell us in good, plain,
direct language what the manager has done—how
many Chinese he has put on, what they are doing,
and so on—and we will wade in to help y0u....
Lazarus: Not a bit interested in teamsters who
come in loaded with 330 bags of wheat. In fact,
this paper’s idea is that they are mostly flash fools
with no regard for either their own property or the
public’s... .Olaf L.: Very near it.... John Y.:
Thanks. We’ll tell the man who did it.... J.L.8.:
“City Brother” hung on the verge till a crowd
behind pushed it in... . G.W.R.: We would send your
request to him if we knew who you are. .. .C.A.M.:
Yes, we'll “put it in our good journal” if you’ll
send the name of the batsman, the date of the
match, who it was between, and where it was
played. Otherwise prejudiced people might say the
paragraph was a trifle vague.... The Oldest Inhabi-
tant’s Grandad: A good gag, but it’s as toothless as
your Uncle John. ...E. J. Lewis: Thanks... .Benno:
Sorry no use ; good luck... .W. Noble: Thanks for the
brother’s letter. Fine, soldierly letter it i 5....
Gillie: Old. ... J.M.P.: Sent it on to Dennis....
G.N.: You ought to know that that is one of the
early Bulletin classics.... Morrie: Pars, furnished
with this sort of thing have no chance: “The animal
in question,” “after a forced march,” “decided to
call a halt,” “with all the persuasive powers,” “of
that ilk,” “it appears from what followed,” “but
an empty shadow,” and so on. The only rotten
phrase you missed was, “what might have been a
serious accident.” How did you dodge that one?
. ...W.C.: Nearly... .J.D.R.: Girls “filling perfec-
tion’s throne” don’t roost in these columns. Give us
worse girls,and better verse.... The Pipe: Rejected
on account of flat feet and lack of biting power.
J.R.: Your Limericks are infamous; “Old Waybaek”
should be smothered in his own whiskers....
S.A.M.: Pussy-smell story has no humor. .. .R.G.8.:
Alleged recruiting verses damned.... Dodo: Omar
parody suitable fodder for cows... .Madallion:
“When I went Cane-cutting from the Original” is a
weird mystery... .F.W.: She’s a dreary mermaiden,
. ...V.P.: Not quite... .Peter Piper: Dull yarn....
0.L.: Thin verse of poor quality... .Bookluek: Is
“trous” short for trousers? If so, you can’t rhyme
it with Janus any more than you can rhyme crowd
with ‘-‘grownd.” By the way, what is “grownd” ?
Can you eat it?... .Suffragette: Careless work this
time and much out of tune. It stands to your
credit, though, that you found an honest rhyme for
Australia. No, we won’t give you away. Put it
into another try....M.P.: Unseated... .Quispam:
Yarn tastes like soapsuds.... Hurst Bathurst: If it
were not for the repetition of “Sir” to eke out lame
lines it might have had a hope... .T.G.C.: Only a
woman with the sort of humor no woman possesses
could tell that yarn. . . .Stenog: No good. Don’t
mix your tenses in that mad fashion... .Nairda:
Some promise, if you are young. Don’t scrawl on
both sides of paper... .W.S.P.: Verse very p00r....
G.R.H.: “Case of Jones” too thin... . M.M.: “Our
Hash House” may. be human; it is dull enough to be
angelic. .. .G.K.: No. .. .J.D.R.: “The Wanderer,”
dull prose with a rhyme or two thrown in. “To
Flo,” mud masquerading as marmalade. .. .L.C.H.S.:
Gag died of its own solemnity... .M.E.G.: Hope your
son won’t turn out as depraved as your verse....
Clancy: What a mistake to leave-the Chow out of the
general massacre... .J. A. J.: Don’t re-write; re-pent.
.... Bellerive: Don’t take it to heart. Mistakes will
happen. The “Side Show” fills the bill this week: —
. ...J.W.: A drunk horse is a joyous novelty; but
your steed merely grows morose in his cups....
M. 8.: Agricultural verse doesn’t carry enough cows.
It.G.C.: Verse a bit too rough... .G.J.H.: Haven't
quite the touch... .T.J.D.: You are likely to con-
tinue neglected if your verse doesn’t improve....
W.A.C.: Had to shunt it. Verse no g00d... .M.A.:
Catalogue of qualities of cherry blossom received.
Rose verselet too weak... .H.T.: Is the Hun who
breaks bottles and leaves them where we have to
walk any wor-se than the Hun who throws dissolute
verses where we have to think ?.... T.H.: “Ballad of
Solomon Jones’’ cast forth with scorn. Your idea
of humor is to say “dirt” and snigger... .E.H.:
“Recollections of Gallipoli” by a man who wasn’t
there appear to be a libel on that moderately-decent
fighter, the Turk.... Les: Verse obscure. Do you
mean that they eat soap raw?... .R.H.C.: The
original “Charge of the Light Brigade” is only
middling' verse; parodies upon it ought to be at
least as mirthful as a sewing-machine... .K.S.: Out.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.J.: No use sending us raw products like that.

J. P. Boucaut was the last of S. Aus-
tralia’s pensioned judges. That State has
always had before it the horrible example of
Chief Justice Cooper, who (after, it is said,
refusing a compromise of £3OOO, while offer-
ing to take £5OOO, which the Ministry of
the day would not give) retired to England
and drew £lOOO a year for 25 years. In
ISB6 S.A. abolished pensions for judges, but
of course excepted the three holding office at
the time. As it happened, Bundey had to
have a special Act to enable him to get the
pension at all, as his health broke down just
before the completion of the 20 years on the
Bench necessary to qualify. Boucaut him-
self lived in retirement for about 11 years,
his once splendid vigor having completely
broken down during the last two or three.
The contrast in Way’s case was very strik-
ing. Prey to an incurable disease, he
battled to the last, and was in his. place on
the Bench right up to the beginning of the
Christmas vacation in which he died.
In a country town
One boxing day,
Tnto a tent show —-
I made my way,
There was a congurer—-
Trying to spin a hat,
A performing dog,
And a acrobat,
While an eccentric clown
To evoketh mirth,
Was barging a drum—
For' all he was worth.

Spare your Spares!
Tis too late to spare, when all is spent.” — Prqverd,
Unless you protect your spares from sun, rain, friction and sudden
changes in temperature, they will be rendered worthless, even before the
occasion for using them arises.
A cover should never be left uncovered —in wet weather or in dry.
It stands to reason that a tyre which is constantly exposed to rain or even
damp must soon begin to deteriorate. Strong sunlight is equally injurious,
causing the best cf rubber to harden, grow brittle, and lose its resiliency.
Use the
• . •. \
Michelin Waterproof Wrapper,
which effectually protects the cover, and can be quickly removed at will.
Michelin Tyres and Accessories can be
obtained from all the Leading Garages.

The war has converted Britain from the

good result this, says that wise spirit, h- in »

IN BANANA LAND
Barakula, the little timber hamlet at the
end of a short railway spur near Dalby,
emphasises itself by putting 30 typhoid eases
into the Dalby hospital. The district used
to be called Dead Man’s Gully, also Cut-
throat Creek, likewise Hell’s Hole, and was
quite adjacent to The Graveyard. The
inhabitants are now wondering whether
Shakspeare knew as much as most people
think he did.
Something was wanted to put heart into
doubters of the “ultimate result.” so the
Rockhampton Bulletin (29/1/T6) weighed
in with this amongst its front page adver-
tisements :—•
To Whom it May Concern. —No German shall
ever rule England or Australia. Michael Ryan, 20
to 9 p.m. 28th instant, 1916. A.n.
Michael, ole boysch (hie), yer ’and (Feb.
3. 1.14 a.m.).
“Aras”: If the Queensland Government
wants to go on with State Socialism and
give Germany a bump at the same time, let
it hearken unto me and take heed. Also let
it get busy. It can start a profitable business
and simultaneously help land settlement.
Wire netting is the “lurk.” Whether the
land is used for grazing or cultivation net-
ting is an absolute necessity to give the
workers a fair chance in most parts of
Queensland. Not only separate holdings but
division paddocks need netting to keep back
the dingo, wild dog. fox, wallaby, rabbit and
other pests that flourish on the output of
kind mother nature in the Queen State. If
the Government built all that would he taken
at a profit of a shilling a mile it would soon
be able to double its own screw and give up
making profitable remarks to Isaac.
“P.F.” : Headmaster Exley, talking at the
Brisbane Teachers’ Conference, told how a
bush kiddy put him in his right class. Exley
had written a story for the Queensland
school paper in which a mother native bear
with two cubs figured largely. Whereupon
a youthful Billjim pointed out to the author
that Mrs. Koala never has more than one
cub at a time. Exley stood corrected —but
was that kiddy right?
The recent dampness at Babinda (Cairns),
which resulted in 24in. in 24 hours, recalls
other notable falls in a like period. Accord-
ing to Hunt. Harvey’s Creek takes up a
miserable fifth place on the list, with a paltry
27.75 in., scoring that position by a narrow
margin of ,02in. from Plane Creek (Mac-
ka.v). Ivuranda takes fourth place with
28.80 in. on April 2, 1911, having apparently
made up its mind on the first to damp the
landscape, as 24.30 in. fell on that day, mak-
ing a total of 53.1 Gin. for 48 hours. Yarra-
bah. where the mission is. stands third on
the list; on April 2. 1911, 30.65 in. fell there
on the sheep and the shepherds alike. Port
Douglas is second on the roll; after eleven
fine attempts to gain notoriety it squeezed
the last few remaining drops out of the
clouds on April 1, 1911. scored 31.53 in. and
retired from the competition. At the apex,
its nose just above the flood, is Croham-
hurst (Blackall Range) with a smart shower
that yielded 35.71 in. within the day and
night.
From an exasperated client: —
Re par. (B. 20/l/’l6) concerning the Agricul-
tural State Bank of Queensland. A large proportion
of the inspectors are of the bank’s own appointing,
but a year or two back the Lands Department, which
is also the guardian angel of the bank, arranged
that its own inspectors (officially branded Crown
land rangers) should work smaller areas, they and
the bank inspectors taking over each other’s work,
thus saving two inspectors from covering a lot of
unnecessary ground. My experience of about half
a dozen of these inspectors is that they are capable
enough, but it is the red tape, combined with lack
of knowledge and sympathy in the office, and the
interference of politicians, that prevents the institu-
tion being a satisfactory and helpful affair. Near
me there are two badly-infested pear blocks which,
though reported against in connection with a loan
application—l’m told this on the best authority—
certainly got substantial advances, and have since
been left on the bank’s hands to show as a bad debt
and to grow more pear. Both these advances were
obtained through the intercession of the political
misrepresentative of the district, who just before
last election reminded a relative of one of the
beneficiaries what he had done for the relative (since
decamped). Also,' both of the “settlers" did their
neighbors a good turn by explaining to them how to
get advances when your holding does not 'warrant
it from a business point of view. The delays and
the lackadaisical way of doing things also puts the
Department in the forefront of Government-stroke in-
stitutions. But several years’ personal experience
convinces me that the inspectors are not to blame
for much. They are the best part of what should,
and could, be a real live and useful institution.
The Gospel of Elective Ministries is being
translated into different political tongues.
The other day Tory Hodge, M.L.A., squat-
toeratic Booker, M.L.A., and Labor Minister
Adamson, standing together on a Banana-
land railway platform, drinking the health
of a new line, agreed that the days of the
party system were numbered. But who is
going to bell the wether?
“Itan” : We make mighty poor progress in
regard to typhoid. Medical science has
chased the devil into a hole, but gets little
help from the local authorities to keep him
there. We seem to tolerate the monster
because he has loafed about the premises so
long. According to Commissioner Moore
the evil thing is spread through human car-
riers. If proper sanitary lids were used to
interfere with the fly’s liberty of action
there would be no spread ; but Bumble won’t
prescribe the dose for the ratepayers, and
the result is good for the undertaker. Lately
the Commissioner got a regulation through
providing that for every case of typhoid which
occurs the local authority must find the local
hospital £2 2s. a week. At time of writing
this is costing Townsville £2OO a week,
although Moore declares that if the place
had listened to him a few months ago £5O
would have prevented the epidemic. The
pity is that this money cannot be taken from
the pockets of the calamitous aldermen.
Bananaland badly wants a crusade against
aldermen and flies.
HILL'S LUCK.
OPTIMIST: "Did you hear about Hill Smith's luck?"
PESSIMIST: "No; kids ill?"
OPTIMIST: “Mime, no! Fell out of his cart, broke his ley, right slay in front of the
blanky hospital."
The Roma oil-boring programme under
State control has commenced: the plant,
which has cost £20,000, is now at work.
A handy fortune has been already dropped
in trying to settle a few things there.
Originally they had a bore for water, but it
was also S’ielding so much gas that they
decided at last to harness it, and the town
was reticulated at a cost of £7OOO. Two
days after the gas was in use the supply
suddenly gave out. While probing to see
what ailed the reservoir it caught fire, and
it took six weeks of manoeuvring to extin-
guish the jet. Then the hole again ceased to
supply gas, and if they strike another sup-
ply on the road down in the new bore-
hole it will be used to revive the sleeping
town plant. Many people scout the idea
of oil being found in payable quantities, or
at all. The gas, these people say, comes
from coal. Other people allege, of course,
that the first lot of people are mere stinking-
fishers. The enterprise will settle the doubt,
and, at the worst, the plant, if unsuccessful,
can he passed on elsewhere. It will take
fully 18 months to cut through the 4000 feet
which may have to be pierced before the
final word is spoken.
It. T. Dibdin, perhaps the best-known
man in Central Queensland, passed out a
few days ago. Dibdin’s history carried him
right back to the old Crocodile rush in ’66
when he acquired the reputation of being
the one gold escort who was never molested.
In connection with Mount Morgan Dibdin
drifted from the escort into the auditor
business and eventually into the directorate.
A big, good-hearted fellow, proud of the
fact that he was directly descended from
Dibdin, who wrote "Tom Bowling” and
other sea-ditties.
"Barcoo” : The old confidence game which
goes under the name of "divining” gave the
usual result in front of the Treasury Build-
ing's, Brisbane, some days ago-. The
seance was watched by Ministers Hamilton
(Mines), Bowman (Home Secretary), llux-
ham (Second-in-charge) and Ilardacre (In-
struction ). The Geological Survey Depart-
ment had ambushed 10 patches of mineral
and ores under ground for the man with the
fork to prove his assertions to the Mines De-
partment that he could locate ores and
minerals, differentiating between the finds.
As the medicine man pranced around the
twig whirled furiously, and the wand was
continually “responding,” but never in one
instance over the location of the “plant.”
I asked if the oracle had discovered any
mines for himself lately, but nobody seemed
to know. The amount of ignorance about
such trifling details is colossal.
Died recently, near Torquay (Eng.),
Francis Edward Bigge, a strenuous colonial
of the old type, who was well known in N.
S. Wales and Queensland in the long ago.
Bigge served in the navy in his young days,
drifted into Australia, settled on the land
and was for a while a member of the
N.S.W. Leg. Assembly, and. later, of the
Queensland Leg. Council. The most thrill-
ing incident in his career was an attack
made on him by four bushrangers, who
wounded him. Bigge told them defiantly he
would yet see them hanged, and he kept his
promise as far as three of them were con-
cerned. He lasted until he was 96.
Thus the Health Commissioner in his
report for 1915 :
°ne milkman in seven is dishonest on the Deoart-
ments figures. Of the 2,000,000 gallons of milk
taken as the metropolitan area supply 236,000 gal-

Some day there will be a ton or two of gaol
followed by the spectacle of Johnny Milk-oh
carrying round a printed placard narrating
ins trauds and the practice of sophistication
will then die a sudden death.
At Anzac Cove.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Anzac Cove, when Death was near,
He led the boys who laughed at fear,
And dashed along victoriously,
And drove th’ astounded Turks to flee
Before that wild Australian cheer.
He was not girt in warlike gear;
But how his feats regaled mine ear
And fired me with his valiancy
At Anzac Cove!
Ah me! I trow the potent beer
(For which I paid) hath cost me dear;
For when I. woke from yonder spree
My purse was gone, and gone was he.
Say, was he flesh or vision sheer,
That Anzac cove?

My Dear Tiiaroomindaii.—
Oil the Roll of Honor is the name 0 f
Sister Norma Mowbray, who died of men
inonia while on duty in Egypt s“t
Mowbray recently came from the FrontT
Australia as a Nightingale to some of 0 !
wounded and every man on the transnuri
spoke of her with affection. Although she
had been offered a voyage to either \IW
land or England to pick up her overtS
health she refused to take the relief-
had, she insisted, signed up to attend to Am?
tralian wounded, and was determined t"
carry on that work. Returning to Em
from Queensland before her strength wa
fully mobilised, she went down before th„
attack of a painful enemy.
Although little has been said about it nu-
clear, don’t think we haven’t a soldiers’ com-
forts fund. We have; but the committee
has no da.ts. So what we ought to do k
to drop a line to the secretary at I'arhm-v
House. (P.S.: Weight the line with I
sinker.)
A clergyman entertained his audience last
Sunday by preaching in his shirt sleeves
It was a poor effort at originality, and not
likely to pack Ins stadium. What is re
<l uired is a defender of the faith who will
deal it out to Sin in bathing trunks That
engagement would necessitate a box-nlan
being opened three weeks ahead. '
A marriage which created a stir in theat-
rical circles took place in Svdnev last
week. The bride was the widow of the late
I ercy St John, and the auxiliary was John
V Mc( allum. of the Branscomhe co. and a
well-known concert manager.
The latest engagement is a matter between
miss Lin McNish and young Lieut Major
The soldier has since started for where he
can do the most good.
A bachelor Gent. One, who recently went
a-holidaying to Sydney, relates how he was
awakened from sleep by mysterious and cat
like sera tellings at his door. Loud "shoos"
and a carefully-aimed boot failed to dislodge
the scratcher, and just when more active
hostilities were being contemplated a trem-
bling female voice said, "Please, may I go
through your room? I’m locked out!” Any-
how, that’s his yarn.
Although "White City,” as the khaki boys
call their amusement halls at Enoggera. is
not yet completed, a concert and picture-
show took place there to-night. A piano
and a billiard-table, presented by the Bris-
bane Girls’ Club, we're handed over before
the performance began.
Dorothy Curran, a violinist with a future,
who recently returned from England, gave
her first recital in her native town. War-
wick, during the week. Warwick is now
open to make a challenge wager.
From "Rosna,” in London:—
Jose Bytheway, the Queensland singer-girl, ha-
just allowed herself to get married to Claude Taylor,
son of a Nottingham doctor, and himself an orna-
ment to the Board of Trade. A Major-General
handed the bride over, and the Attorney-General
I hos. Robinsons and other Bananalanders saw fair
play.
Chaplain Merrington, newly returned from
Shrapnel Gully, was welcomed by his con-
gregation on Wednesday night. He, like
Chaplain Robertson, says that the discipline
of the Australians was splendid. He also
has a hearty word for brother chaplains of
other denominations, and avows that there
never was the slighest suggestion of discord.
All the available discord was reserved for
the unbrotherly foe.
Yours affectionately,
Australia Jane.
P.S.—I forgot to mention that on Wednes-
day last the Governor wandered up to Ips-
wich and opened the new wing of the hospi-
tal. Monday will see him in Warwick,
where he will open the Show. —A.J.
Some of these silent Bananaland Billjiuis
—the finest mates in the whole wide world
—travel a long way to nominate for glory.
At Alton Downs, a few miles out from
Rockhampton, one asked that he be entered.
Bit by bit they dragged out his story. Hav-
ing been turned down at • Georgetown for
being below the height, he set out for Rock-
hampton, 1200 miles away, to try his luck.
He lost five horses on the way, and now
offered his last prad, worth £2O, besides him-
self. The recruiting-officer promised to do
his best to get him through. An army
couldn't afford to turn down pluck like that
even if the bit of grit was no more than 4ft.
to the top.
Bajool, on the North Coast (Q.) lin<?!
lately sent the local army into camp with
the following testimonial, compiled by the
local newspaper correspondent: —
Mr. will be greatly missed by the old resi-
dents of Bajool as he took a keen interest in sporting
circles and dances in and around Bajool. At times
he rendered music both on the accordion and mouth-
organ, and acted as M.C., and whenever he got up
to give a song you could rest assured it would be
worth listening to. Prior to enlisting lie followed
the occupation of a timber-getter, and from several
gatherings he carried away the prize for wood-
chopping.
When at the end of January, seven months
of the financial year having gone, Ryan had
a look at the Bananaland ledger, he found
that ordinary expenditure had over-reached
the revenue by £194,802. Of course it
doesn’t matter for the present, and. anyhow.
Ryan has got an advance of half a million
from the Commonwealth to settle up the
latest interest bills in London. A few years
ago a State Treasurer nearly made it a mat-
ter for a duel when The Bulletin suggested
that his Government was borrowing to pa>
interest. Now, in these days of economy
and cautious financing and all the rest of in
a Treasurer goes on the housetop to commit
the offence. Which shows how wonderful!.'
our public sense of decency has improved.

FEEL BADLY ALL OVER.
When you feel badly all over but with no
particular organ of your body noticeably out
of order, you need a tonic for your blood.
You require a medicine that will benefit the
whole system. The blood reaches every part
of the body, and when it is built up the
whole system quickly benefits.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are a non-alco-
holic tonic that builds up the blood, making
it rich and red and able to supply to the
tissues of the body the nourishment they
need to keep them in health.
Most general debility results from thin
blood. Every part of the body suffers, and
you “feel badly all over.” When the blood
is restored and a health-giving stream is
going to every part of the body you soon see
the result in a better appetite,' an improved
digestion, brighter eyes, better color in
cheeks and lips.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are a most valu-
able family tonic, and should be taken by
every member of the family except infants
whenever the general health is not what it
should be. Much downright sickness has
been saved by the use of a tonic or support-
ing medicine in times of physical depression.
All dealers sell Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. —

AN AFTER=DINNER PILL.
Most people eat too much. If you are a
hearty eater help your digestion, take care
of the over-load by taking one Pinkette, the
little sugar-coated laxative ovals, after a big
dinner. Pinkettes gently stimulate the
stomach, prevent congestion and the many
distressing results of over-indulgence at the
table.
Pinkettes, the new laxative, are greatly
superior to old-fashioned medicines which
over-stimulate the liver, and, when their use
is stopped, leave it more torpid than before.
Pinkettes do not upset the stomach or cause
griping.
Pinkettes should be in every household.
Do not wait until you need to take them,
buy a bottle now. If your chemist cannot
supply you, send Is. to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Sydney, for a full-sized bottle;
or send your name and' address, mentioning
The Bulletitv, and a free sample will be
sent to you.— Advt.

This Week’s TOILET HINTS
SELECTED RECIPES FROM HERE AND THERE.—THINGS EVERY WOMAN WANTS
TO KNOW.
The Magnetism of Beautiful
Hair.
“Applied Arts.”
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
lookout for any harmless thing that will
increase the natural beauty of their hair.
The latest method is to use pure stallax as a
shampoo, on account of the peculiarly glossy,
fluffy and wavy effect which it leaves. As
stallax has never been used much for this
purpose it comes to the chemist only in 11b.
sealed original packages, enough for twenty-
five or thirty shampoos. A teaspoonful of the
fragrant stallax granules, dissolved in a cup
of hot water, is more than sufficient for each
shampoo. It is very beneficial and stimulat-
ing to the hair, apart from its beautifying
effect.
Permanently Removing
Superfluous Hair.
“Toilet Gossip.”
How to permanently, not merely tempo-
rarily, remove a downy growth of disfiguring
superfluous hair, is what many women wish
to know. It is a pity that it is not more
generally known that pure powdered pheminol.
obtainable from the chemists, may be used
for this purpose. It is applied directly to
the objectionable hair. The recommended
treatment not only instantly removes the
hair, leaving no trfice. but is designed also to
kill the roots completely
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
A simple, old-fashioned, home-made recipe will make
the greyness disappear.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always .'obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to a
natural color in a perfectly harmless manner.
You have only to get an ounce of tammalite
concentrate from your chemist and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum to prove tm

To Have Smooth, White
Skin, Free from Blemish.
“Boudoir Gossip.”
Does your skin chap or roughen easilv
become unduly red or blotchy V Let me’ten
you a quick and easy way to overcome the
trouble and keep your complexion beautifmir
white, smooth and soft. Just get snml
ordinary mercolised wax at the chemist’s Xi
use a little before retiring as you would
cold cream. The wax, through some peculiar
action, flecks off the rough, discolored or
blemished skin. The worn-out cuticle comes
off just like dandruff on a diseased scalp only
in almost invisible particles. Mercolised wax
simply hastens Nature's work, which is the
rational and proper way to attain a perfect
complexion, so much sought after, but very
seldom seen. The process is perfectly simple
and quite harmless
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous remedy for blackheads, greasy skin
and large pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very simple
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler fuii
of hot water. After the effervescence has
subsided bathe the face in the liquid, using a
small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
come right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at intervals of four or five days re
ensure the permanence of the result. I!

NELSON & ROBERTSON,

and South Sea Island..
Street, SYDNEY.
The wife of a farmer at Kamarooka, near
Bendigo (Vie.), has more luc-k than the man
who spilt his beer. While she was feeding
a parrot on her hand the other day a thun-
derstorm arrived and the bird was killed by
lightning. A dead bird in the hand is better
than your own wake any day.
The war is letting light into the private
affairs of a good many trading concerns.
Thus, to set tongues at rest, it was lately
made known that for over 20 years one man,
an Englishman—Henry S. Wellcome —has
been the sole proprietor of the vast Bur-
roughs-Wellcome business, whose roots run
out from London through the five continents.
“Chug” : Heard some women talking in a
railway carriage the other day about com-
pulsory service, and got out of the train
wondering. One and all they were abusing
those who favored conscription, and the
ground of their objection was that it was
a movement to get the soldiers' pay reduced
to a shilling a day. Now, can’t we find the
person who started that vicious lie, and in
a spirit of pure, decent patriotism, hang him
to the Post Office clock?
“Vicski”: I wish my friends who sit on
what you call the water-cart would not hold
up my country as a shining example
of prohibition. The Russian prohibition is a
different thing altogether. In Russia beer
is not booze at all. It counts with Ivan
Ivanovski as ginger-beer /loes with your
water-cart. There’s plenty of beer in Russia
to-day. There’s likewise plenty of wine.
Prohibition extends only to vodka, a strong,
raw rye spirit, somewhat similar in flavor
and performance to good old mulga rum or
bluegum whisky made on the premises.
Father Fahey, the young priest who
recently got a D. 5.0., has a heap of admirers
in the West. He left Kalgoorlie as R.C.
chaplain at the beginning of the war, and
many stories have been told in soldiers’ let-
ters of his bravery. One related how he led
a charge and inspired those around him.
Fahey is 32 years of age. He studied at
Genoa and came to the West six years ago,
working first among the timber-cutters in
the South-West and subsequently on the
goldfields.
The odd fact that the kind of woman who
is loudest in demanding the Vote is also
the kind that takes the lead in singing “I
Didn’t Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier,” has
been the reason of a heavy set-back to
woman suffrage in U.S.A. New York State,
carefully canvassed, was understood to be
in favor of granting the suffrage; but the
men who have to decide the matter have
lately observed that the woman’s vote would
be likely to mean a peace-at-any-price vote.
So, considering that a strengthened army
and navy are much more important than a
domestic squabble, they said to the expect-
ant suffragette “Not now!” Having Would-
write Wilson, they reckoned the womanish
element was strong enough already.
The Defence Department says it can dis-
cover no reason for the abnormally large
proportion of rejects in Victoria. Possibly,
for some abstruse reason, it doesn’t want to.
A business concern addicted to systematising
its results would long ago have found out
why towns like Warrnambool. Sale and
Bendigo have had from 20 to 28 per cent,
of volunteers rejected, while Ballarat, Mil-
dura and Horsham have had from 05 to 72
per cent, thrown out. Horsham isn’t far
from Warrnambool, yet in one place four out
of five men are deemed fit; in the other
three out of four are rejected. When the
consequences are so serious there seems to
be too much luck about the thing alto-
gether.
“Billy T.”: Melbourne has a quaint
specialist in crime. He is a mild-mannered
little man with a pale blue eye and a weak-
ness for white vests and black alpaca coats.
He carries an umbrella, and parts his hair
in the middle. You could not imagine a less
unlikely-looking criminal; yet he is a gaol-
bird and is well enough known to the Vic-
torian police to have served nine sentences
already. His specialty is robbing churches
and vestries and parsonages, and whenever
a church is robbed within 20 miles of the
town clock he is the first person to be
looked up. He will take anything from a
pulpit to a hassock, but the performance on
which lie most prides himself was stealing
an organ from a small chapel down Sand-
ringham way. He backed a mussel barrow
through the double doors, and took the box
away in broad daylight. His nine sentences
he calls his religious convictions.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”
French’s Forest, just outside Sydney, is to be the
home of the first soldiers whom Australia settles on
the land. Of course, only farmlcts of 10 acres or
so are possible in that circumscribed area. The
original grantee was described in early days as “James
French, landowner, North Shore.’’ He married Mary
Blue, daughter of the historic Billy. She inherited
a share of the Blue's Point estate under her father's
will, made in 1834, a few days before his death. This
grant to Billy Blue was made by Lachlan Macquarie
on January 24, 1817. It was “free of all taxes, quit
rents and other acknowledgments,” and was for a
term of five years, provided that he cultivated 18
acres—the farm afterwards of James French. After the
five years there was to be an annual quit rent of
two shillings. Another of Billy’s daughters married
George Lavender, bo’s’n of the hulk Phoenix, then
lying in the bay now called Lavender. The grant
followed on condition that Billy ran a ferry across
Sydney Harbor.
In ail erratic, unreasonable manner Vic-
toria still tries to “keep holy” the Sabbath
day, even in the remote bush. The other
Sunday a farmer at Cohuna, the irrigation
settlement up near Kerang, went out with
a gun. An inspector followed, afar off. and
presently nailed him under the provisions of
an Act passed the year before King Charles
lost his head for the last time. It cost the
farmer two sovs. At about the same time
the legislators who haven’t found it con-
venient to unmake this holy law were dip-
ping in an unhallowed- river of sparkling
wine and wearing out expensive motor-car’s
Li another part of the Victorian backblocks ;
bur so far no ancient statute has arisen to
smite them with a suitable punishment. And
if the farmer will get on a box and yell to
his neighbors to take up a gun and "use it
all round the clock in shooting another kind
of game he will get three cheers for his good
citizenship. It is a muddled old world.

Some people do nothing for constipation and allow themselves
to be costive for days at a time. A more foolhardy thing cannot
be done as a constipated person is liable to all sorts of diseases.
To be indifferent to constipation is as unhealthy and uncleanly
as not to wash or bathe, for a bowel movement is to the inside of
the body what bathing is to the outside.
Instead of trying some make-shift that gives but temporary
relief take Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver.
They regulate the bowels gently and scientifically and perfect
relief is brought about in the most obstinate cases.
Thousands of people now enjoy the best of health after trying

EVERY WOMAN CAN ENJOY
FULL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT.
ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect appear-
ance. L,ack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks, and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman
the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural
development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency. Bven though you
have never been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from
no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal.

Manager, Falliere Co. Ballarat, Vic.
Dear Sir, —Since beginning Flesh-Food I have derived
great benefit from the treatment. My bust has developed,
and my weight has increased as much as 1 desired, and
no further treatment will be necessary.
Yours sincerely,
N. SULLIVAN.

_ Gympie, Queensland,
-lanager Flesh-Food Co. May 5, 1913.
car Sir.—As a nurse, I was very interested in your Flesh-Food treatment, and
' S r catly surprised at the wonderful results in my case. When I first wrote to you 1
f r B ° n ,v s l t i n and bone, and I have good cause to be thankful that I wrote you for a

being ample.
I am, yours gratefully.
MRS. E. WINGROVE.
DR. FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD is totally
harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond
question, and its use is no demand upon the subject’s
time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a
week, and an increase in bust measurement up to
eight and ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers
relief and development to the thousands of chronically
thin women who have despaired of ever possessing u
presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-
treatment that adds weight and permanent develop-
ment to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every
case accepted.

i’ll Beorge Street,
A Geelong native, architect Percy Everett,
has been made principal of the Victorian
Government’s new technical school at Bruns-
wick. Though he comes from Geelong, Ever-
ett has had an all-round training in his own
line, and has studied gargoyles in Europe,
bungalows in the U.S.A., and sewage systems
wherever possible; also he has soaked in a
lot of knowledge not usually absorbed by
architects, and knows how to make use of
it. His appointment is another illustration
of the joyous fact that Victoria is getting
well out of its old habit of throwing this
sort of stout billet at mediocre foreigners.
“Shellback” : Sydney Harbor Trust has a
regulation that a gangway, properly lighted
at night, must be provided between every
vessel and the wharf at which the ship is
lying, but it doesn’t bother to enforce the
provision, although there is a heart-breaking
list of serious accidents every year in conse-
quence. Even the usually-powerful Water-
side Workers’ Union has failed to get the
regulation enforced. Last week, when the
Coroner was “sitting” on the dead body of
the Trust’s own dredge watchman, it was
admitted that the Commissioners didn’t pro-
vide any sort of gangway for his safety.
The excuse for this, presumably, was that
the dredge was an imported contraption and
naturally expected to be a death trap.
From “The Old Soldier,” who knows the
job:—■
A veteran of the Woolloomooloo War, writing in
S. M. Herald over the name of “Sergeant,” has
this to say: “The most heartbreaking part of an
officer’s or N.C.O.’s work during the period of recruit-
training is to educate Australians to submit to dis-
cipline. It is almost an impossibility to teach a
new man instantly to obey an order, and to get him
into the soldierly habit of coming to attention when
addressing anyone of superior rank, or saluting when
passing him in camp or elsewhere.” I wonder if
this wearisome sergeant ever had the job of handling
British recruits, or British militiamen, or, what are
often much harder to manage, some of the Indian
native races? Take, for instance, five ease of a
Staffordshire collier who, as likely as not, doesn't
know his own name, because he has always been
accustomed to hear himself called “Big Yed” or
something of that sort, and who, when he rvmes
before the Adjutant on joining, yawns at him, and
asks: “W’at dun yo say?” “Sergeant” ought to
meet some of that kidney, or some Gurkha recruits
I have known who could neither speak nor under-
stand any known language. Finally, Hamilton and
Bird wood would be proud to tell “Sergeant” some-
thin? about Australian discipline. Of course, they
are mere Generals, and were only knocking about
amongst the boys in the Terrible Isthmus, but they
know a little about it.
Concerning a wonder that’s coming:—
A wondrous novelty is the inadequately-named
Hookless Fastener, the invention whereof was pirated,
years ago, ere it was completed. You buy a strip of
ribbon with a metal spinal cord running through the
centre. You tear the strip asunder, stitch it to both
sides of the placket (or the two ends of the bodice)
in place of hooks and eyes, or buttons and button-
holes, and then draw it together by pulling a little tag
of ribbon. The split spinal cord is then itself again.
The thing works like a conjurer’s trick. If it had
been in vogue in Old Jerusalem amorous King Solo-
mon would have enjoyed the job of fastening up 1000
wives at the back. But they wouldn’t have wanted
hubby’s assistance. It is as good for male garments
—the men at Melbourne Fire Brigade headquarters
saw it and grabbed it. And bootmakers are bound
to have it presently. The man with the Australian
agency for this tricky little article is a young Aus-
tralian himself, and he reckons, of course, that there
are “millions” in it.
Edward Wlrite, M.L.C. for the Western
Province of Victoria, has done his dash in
regard to the shipping of wheat from Port-
land and has had to inform his constituents
that Minister for Agriculture Ilagelthorn,
doting on an “expert report,” refuses to
entertain the proposal. So much for the
earnestness of the Peacock Government as a
systematic decennialiser. True, there is the
“expert report” ; hut as expensive improve-
ments have but lately been made at Port-
land, and as there are many shiploads of
wheat handy to those improvements, and as
the port is nearer Europe than Melbourne
is, for once Hagelthorn might have acted
as his own expert, and given himself some
of his own advanced-Liberal advice. Because
he has failed the North-West province may
tell him later on things that will hurt.
“Mujik” goes to a charity “carnival”:—
When Jimblicks, sweating with exertion, dis-
entangled himself from the crowd, someone raked
up a couple of handsful of confetti, sand and manure
from the road and gave him a bath; whereupon
everyone round about broke into applause, and .Tim-
blicks, wiping the filth out of his eyes and ears,
reckoned it was a good job he came early so as not
to miss anything. So he casually put . his arm
round a sylph-like form which pushed against him,
and together they fought their way to a cold-drink
emporium, where a total stranger emptied a squash
into Jimblick’s pocket, and the girl was so amused
that she swallowed her liquid the wrong way, and
capsized what was Jeff all over an overflowing
laundress who was inhabiting the garb of a hero
from Gallipoli. It was all so excruciatingly funny
that Jimblicks seized a flapper, and pressing her to
his heart waltzed out into the street again and per-
formed the mazy two-step for fully three minutes.
Then the flapper bit his ear, and escaped before
Jimblicks saw the joke. Having kissed seven girls
Jimblicks found himself standing hand-in-hand with
someone who said her name was Gladys and she
was looking for her ma. While he was protect-
ing her from the crowd and getting a description of
nra so that he could bolt if he saw the old girl
coming, a merry party on a balcony above poured
fireworks over him. It was most refreshing, and
provoked insistent demands for an encore. And
when Jimblicks looked up from among the crackers
to see if anyone. was going to pour a basket of
barbed wire over him by mistake, poor Gladys
became so infected by the fun that she produced a
large syringe which happened to be full of ink, and,
pushing the end against his collar, discharged the
contents down his chest and shirt. The humor of
this struck a kind lady with such force that she
smacked Jimblicks’ hat over his eyes and another
lady poured more confetti and sand and manure
over him. It was a wonderful time. Jimblicks
made the trip home with a large, decorative female
sitting on his knee eating chocolates and telling him
that she believed in being friendly with everyone,
especially when there was such a good cause in view
as raising funds for a hospital. And Jimblicks
seconded the motion, and remarked that the main-
tenance of hospitals was a great social obligation,
and he had never had such a really enjoyable time
in his life.
There is a great gap in the family of Mrs.
John Fulton, who lives at Mudgeeraba, near
the Tweed Heads (N.S.W.). Out of six sons
who went to do a bit against the Turk and the
Teuton, only one remains alive, and he came
back wounded, but is still helping Australia
as a recruiting sergeant at Rockhampton.
John was killed at Oallipoli, William fell in
France, Tom at La Basse, George in France
and A. I). left his bones in Gallipoli. Hats
ol T to them, and the mother that bore them!
Knocked up at the 70-mile peg, on the
sth instant, John D. Mackay, once partner
with John Dight in, and later sole owner
of. Bulgandramine station, Bogan River.
After selling that out to its present owners,
Cannon Brothers, he purchased the late
George Lee’s long-owned Bathurst property,
iveeholme. But he was restless on such a
small proposition, and added a big Queens-
land run to his grey hairs. A noted breeder
and judge of shorthorns, he was a well-
known and welcome figure at Western shows
and will have many mourners.

SHOES are exquisitely cool and light in the
hottest weather, yet none of your dowdy,
canvas shoes either but smart, elegant, in
the fore-front of fashion. Most Australian
women will have sighed for' such shoes, and here
they are in the latest shipment of Bostocks. The
model illustrated is delightful even in picture
form. But think of it in reality, a light, grace-
ful shoe of finest moire, built in that new, short-
fronted shape so thoroughly French, and made
with a dainty Louis heel. If ever there was
an ideal shoe for smart wear in hot weather, it
is certainly this one. Then for other tastes,
there are other shoes equally charming in this
Bostoek selection. The shoes are unmistakable,
and have the name Bostoek stamped on the soles.

which Kruschen Salts cannot benefit
has yet to be discovered. This

KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT
Since the outbreak of the War, enormous
quantities of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Honie. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN

handed down from generation to generation of

The Inky Way.
This is to announce the resurrection of
John Plumper Iloolan, one time leader of
the Queensland Labor party, who fell from
grace and glory through voting for the
Chillagoe private railway. John Plumper
has now rejoined the Inky Way and is
resuscitating the Mundic Miner, George-
town, whose editor went to have an argu-
ment with the Turks. Hoolan stood for the
Senate once, but got* so few votes that he
has not aspired to political dishonors since.

This is what a soldier who was in the
thick of it writes concerning Bean: —
He gave a great account of the Lone Pine affair—
glorious ! What he saw was quite true. He paints
the fighting well—quite true and not exaggerated.
. .. .And there are a couple of quiet lines saying that
the Maorilanders were relieved by a couple of bat-
talions of English troops, who had to retire. There
it ends. I don’t know, but I think if those battalions
could have only held on things to-day would be a lot
different. It was a great fight—told well. Every
time I have read the account, and knowing where
the hill is, and what significance is attached to it,
those couple of quiet lines have come home to me.

“Itan”: What a long time Sydney has
been at the job of cleaning out the Augean
stable! According to Kink O’Malley, Lord
Mayor Meagher is going to have a try with
the democratic hose filled with the waters
of life. It reminds me. It was about 15
years ago, during the time Dr. Graham and
others proposed to do some hosing. The
doctor-alderman was promising things at a
meeting in Surry Hills. The junior paper
man was first on the scene and had written
up some copy before the senior man rolled
in. As is customary the junior handed over
his stuff. His contemporary was seen to be
anxiously eyeing a slip which had a long
reference to the cleaning out of the Augean
stable. At length he whispered across the
table that they might as w T ell cut out the
stable. “But why?” asked the junior. “Oh,
well,” said the other; “it’s such an old-
established institution that I’m afraid the
owners may issue a writ for libel.”
* * * *
“F.B.”: Various people have fallen in
again through taking things for granted.
This time it is in connection with the story
of the evacuation of Anzac. The mistake
arose first in the Maoriland papers, which
credited the vivid pen-picture to the M.L.
official correspondent, Malcolm Ross. The
Wellington Post published a correction to
the effect that the Minister for Defence had
received a cable that Ross was seriously ill
and that C. E. W. Bean was acting for him
and that the description of the preparations
for the evacuation of Anzac and Suvla was
sent by the Australian correspondent. But
the mistake did not end here. Maoriland
correspondents transmitted the story to Lon-
don, and a few days ago the Sydney papers
in the cable “combine” asserted that “the
London newspapers are making a feature of
the narrative of Mr. Malcolm Ross, the
Maoriland correspondent with the Expedi-
tionary Forces, descriptive of the last days
of Anzac.” Sydney D.T. and Evening
News made amends when their attention
was drawn to the mistake, but the S. M.
Herald let the wrong to its own old staff-
man go unrighted.
* * * *
“Lovelight”: Pressmen will be interested
ia an Inky Way marriage in London. Most
of the older hands on the Melbourne dailies
remember the dapper little Thorold Dal-
rymple Waters, of the fruity, fluty tenor,
who used to do the Eastern Departments for
the Age and contribute occasional verse to
Tiie Bulletin over the pen-name “Thoro’d
Dalrymple.” His mother was at one time
an advt. canvasser for Melbourne Herald.
About a dozen years ago Thorold lit out for
the Old World 'with the object of becoming
a musical planet. He twinkled desultorily
for some time, and when the Hun blew the
war-horn joined the London special con-
stabulary, becoming inspector of the Stoke
Newington division. He has now married
Alice Reay, eldest daughter of Field-Admiral
Reay, former editor and now London rep.
of Melbourne Herald. Brigadier-Howitzer
Reay has also done special police duty in
London, and Alice must feel very secure
with two cops in the family. Another of
Warrant-Corporal Reay’s daughters, Nan,
is nursing with the Expeditionaries, and has
been mentioned in despatches.
PROTECTING THE CENSOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The printer or publisher of any newspaper, period-
ical, or book, or other publication, shall not, with-
out the permission of an officer of the censorship
staff, print or publish any statement to the effect,
or from which it can be inferred, that any altera-
tion, addition or omission has been made by the
censorship. —New regulation.
The Censor’s shears are long and sharp,
The Censor’s eyes are keen;
In these grim days you must not harp
On matters known and seen.
The war is raging up and down,
The cannon thunder loud;
And things occur in camp and town
That must not reach the crowd.
The foe, of course, the truth may learn
That Billjim threw a brick,
Or that some Teuton we intern
Whose deeds of shame are thick ;
But these and other fearsome things
That happen in the dark
The tripe-smith in the ink he slings
Must pass with no remark.
Still, something awful may get through
And catch the Censor’s eye ;
And then a pencil large and blue
Across the screed will fly.
The mangled copy, shorn and lean,
In dreary print may stand,
But nowhere in the wrack is seen
The Censor’s heavy hand.
In the hushed dark behind the veil
He hides from every gaze;
Fact loses both its ears and tail
In that fierce game he plays.
And we, not he, must own the deed
When truth is put to rout;
We dare not say to those who read:
“The Censor cut it out.”

The True Safeguard
of Baby’s Health
Allenburgs Foods
THE milk of a healthy mother confers a de-
gree of immunity to infection to the young
infant. Many mothers, however, though
willing, cannot nurse their babies for various
reasons. In such cases the greatest care should
betaken in selecting a proper substitute. Ordi-
nary cow’s milk cannot be regarded as a safe
food for infants; it is acid, contains indigestible
curd, and is almost invariably contaminated
with harmful germs. By using the “Allenburys
Foods, which are free from all dangerous
organisms, and effectually replace human
milk, security for baby is ensured and vigorous
growth and health are promoted. The
“Allenburys” Foods are largely used and
recommended by the Medical and Nursing
Professions; they have stood the test of time
and have become a household necessity all
over the world.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Make Peace with
Your Stomach.
Take one
TWENTY MINUTES
BEFORE.
AND
ONE
AFTER.
YOU CANNOT FORCE your stomach to do
work that it is unable to do. It has been tried
time and again, with always the same result.
The stomach is a good and faithful servant,
but when pushed beyond the limit it rebels.
Some stomachs will stand much more abuse
than others, but every stomach has _ its limit,
and when that limit is reached it is a very
dangerous and unwise proceeding to attempt to
force it into doing further work.
THE REASONABLE COURSE and the most
sensible is to procure a substitute to carry on
the work of digestion and give the stomach an
opportunity to recuperate and regain its lost
strength. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are
the only perfect substitute to take up and
carry on the work of tired, worn-out stomachs.
They are natural and easy in their work, and
cause no disturbance in the digestive organs.
They contain all of the essential elements that
make up the gastric juice and other digestive
fluids, and will digest any food that a strong,
healthy stomach will, and do it in the same
time and in the same way.
THEY WORK INDEPENDENTLY of sur-
rounding conditions, and the fact that a stomach
is weak or diseased does not influence them at
all in their useful and effective work. They will
digest food just as well in a glass jar or bottle
as they will in a stomach. You can see that
for yourself by putting one of them into a jar
with a square meal and some warm-water to
enable them to work.
THEY ACTUALLY DIGEST the food, and do it completely, thoroughly and
independently, thus giving the weak and weary stomach an opportunity to renew
and regain its wasted strength. You will forget that you have a stomach, just
as you did when you were a healthy boy or girl, and that organ, being relieved of
its work, will be enabled to rest and recuperate and regain its health and strength.
DR, SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES are sold everywhere at 2/6 for a
tin containing 80 Tabules. Buy a tin, eat a good square meal, and then take a
Tabule and note the result. You will forget all about it if you are not careful,
for there will be NO PAIN, nor disturbance, and the food will be DIGESTED
just as it used to be when your STOMACH was WELe and STRONG.
Furthermore, your stomach will soon be restored again if you keep on taking
them, just as thousands of other stomachs have been from the sole and exclusive use of

Windjammer Men.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF it is sailormen you’d meet,
Tarry jackets, skysail packets,
Back to the old windjammer fleet
You have got to go.
That’s where you’ll find ’em growin’ yet,
All a-growin’ and a-blowin’,
Hammering round the wind an’ wet,
Beatin’ to and fro.
Sailorin’ men on sailer ships,
Roarin’ rough ’uns, tearin’ tough ’uns,
Seamen, though, to the finger-tips,
That we boast and claim.
Ev’ry finger a fishin’ hook,
Web-foot toes an’ scaly clothes,
No brass-bindin’ to our book —
But we knows the same.
We are no steam bridge-stanchion men —-
Eh my bullies, steam winch pulleys—
Workin’ ship with a fountain pen,
Fig’ring coals an’ miles ;
Run to time like a railway train,
Deck’ands, stokers, fireside pokers,
Week out o’ port an’ in again !
Seamen? ’Scuse our smiles.
That ain’t what we call goin’ to sea —
Hey m’ hearties, our tea-parties,
Full-reef gale an’ the rocks a-lee,
That’d make ’em squeal.
That or runnin’ our Easting down,
Sail a-packing, sticks a-cracking,
Let ’er broach an’ you let ’er drown —
Stead-y at the wheel.
We’re just the same wind-jammin’ crew,
Old square-riggers, jibs to jiggers,
Sailing ship as they used to do
Cook’s and Nelson’s day ;
Fistin’ the same old flappin’ sails,
Tops’ls, trys’ls, stun- an’ sky-s’ls,
Fightin’ the same old flamin’ gales,
Like they showed the way.
Full year at sea, full week ashore
(Ho m’ jollies! Sues an’ Pollies!),
Money to burn an’ plenty more
Waitin’ us at sea.
Taking our loves an’ liquors fast,
Boosin’, bruisin’, lovin’, losin’;
Liquor don’t last and girls go past
When our pay’s to lee.
So once again the anchor’s weighed
(Heave an’ she must, ah heave an’ bust!),
Another port an’ a nicer maid
Hopin’ we will find.
That’s the kind of a crowd we are,
Easy, breezy, as-you-please-y,
Sailing to compass, wind or star,
Seeing or sailing blind.
Blow the land down is all we ask,
Lee rail under, goin’ like thunder,
North to freeze, or south to bask
Where the warm Trades blow.
North or south or east or west,
How she’s bearin’ no one’s carin’,
Give us a breeze an’ chance the rest —
Ilyah ! Roll an’ go !
When it’s for seamen that y’ hails —
’Hoy, ship a-hoy, my bully boy!
Proper old shellback deep-sea whales,
Hear us answer then ;
Drag the deeps with a fine mesh net,
Sieve all the seas, sift ev’ry breeze,
What’s the pick o’ the men you’ll get?

“Fitting Out” in Pharaoh’s
Land.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A MONTH or so ago the transport
Aromatic was lying at anchor in
Zens Bay. One morning the chief
engineer informed me that we required some
ammonia for the freezer. “If we can’t get
it, sir,” he added gloomily, “it will just
about settle our hash !”
“Right-o, Chief,” I said airily. “We must
try to get some.”
We thereupon shifted “rig,” went ashore
and called at the Transport Office. At the
door we spoke to an officer about the matter.
He seemed astonished. “Ammonia? Am-
monia?” he queried in a “wot-yer-gettin’-at-
now” sort of tone. “Ammonia? Not much
chance here, I fear,” he said hopelessly.
We gazed at each other blankly. Some-
thing had to be done. I forthwith drew a
picture of our pitiful plight after 8000 miles
of ocean on a freezer that couldn’t work
overtime! “Yes, yes. . . .of course. .. .quite
so,” he replied, biting the end of his pencil.
Suddenly he swung round and called upon
one Antonio. A Grecian ouill-walloper ap-
peared seemingly from under a counter at
the far end of the office. The busy official
jerked out: “Mildcoldstorage—telephone—
quick—presto—ammonia—Aromatic !” An-
tonio disappeared into the telephone-box.
J' e sat down anxiously on a packing-case.
After much ringing and “Vos-you theres?” the
Greek poked out his freckled face and re-
marked : “No can do. No ’ave got, sail - .”
The senior officer sat within a glassed-in
sanctum. We unburdened ourselves to him.
He wore a pained expression and looked at
over his pince-nez.
Humph!” he muttered, stroking his chin.
Get me see,” he reflected, taking off his
glasses and wiping them on a khaki hand-
Then his face brightened.

l he interview concluded, we were metaphori-
cally waved into the street,
i wa ? a h ot > dusty day. The air was
aden with the perfumes of Araby. The
Vet- sa id, “What a stinking hole!”
'.He is not a poet.) I admit that flies were
persistently attentive, as also were urchins
who demanded backsheesh. We wandered
aimlessly. Countless boatmen expressed
eagerness to take us off to “sheep mit great
quickness.” We watched the skilfully-
handled dhows sailing to and fro; we saw
the nimble donkeys, about the size of goats,
straining under shameful loads of cargo from
the quays; we mingled amongst a medley of
Egyptians, Greeks, Hindus, Dagos, Arabs,
Nubians, speaking a fearsome gibberish.
Nobody talked —everybody screamed. They
all screamed at once. We wondered who list-
ened. Big-stomached, fez-topped persons
.paraded grandly in flowing skirts and tweed
coats. We pondered upon the invariable
roguishness of people with Biblical antece-
dents. We meandered past evil-smelling
vendors’ stalls. Grimly fascinating were the
wiry, red-fezzed, white-tuniced constabulary,
whose stout sticks smote the miscreants’
hacks until they howled again. “Kismet”
wasn’t in it.
Early on the morrow we returned to head-
quarters and learned the news from Kibosh.
Instead of ammonia we received a cold
douche. “Unable supply; try Garibaldi,
Port Nuffzed,” the telegram read.
“Send the fool further,” I mused.
Officials suggested telephoning. We put in
a disconsolate half-hour. Antonio gibbered
within the box ; without, we murdered flies.
At length the scribe got a bite.
“ ’Ere it is, sair,” he stammered, handing
me the ear-piece.
“Acha,” I gasped. “Is that Garibaldi’s?”
I asked anxiously.
* “Non, but I go make see, yes,” said some-
thing, and departed.
I sighed. A starting buzzing nearly broke
my ear-drum, I scowled at the Chief and
wished his freezer in
There was another earsplit like smashing
crockery. It stopped suddenly, and a voice
said: “Hello, eh, whom was it?” I replied
that it was the captain of his Majesty’s
transport Aromatic, and it was anxious to
be supplied with some ammonia.
“Ah-ha,” said the ear-piece. “Ammonia,
eh?....’Ow much of cylindre, sair, yes?”
“Two small,” I said, feeling a little elated
at the prospect of drawing a winner.
“Two small, sair,” said the voice. “Non,
sair—very much big, sair, eh?”
Perspiration welled forth, "How big,
then?” I asked impatiently. The other end
replied faintly: “One ’undred pound cylin-
dre, sair, no?”
“All right, then,” I shouted; “send two.”
“Send to what—to what you say, sair,
eh?” came from the Dago.
The heat, the flies, the
“Damn it!” I yelled. “Can’t you savee,
eh? Here you, Giuseppe, Garibaldi, Angos-
tura, what’s-yer-name, listen” —I tried to be
calm —“I say, send two, two cylinder—one,
two —una, duo —eki, deki —alpha, beta....
savee, duo —two, eh?” I hoped the tele-
phone wouldn’t burst for a minute.
“Oh, yes, sair, allri,” came the reply, “I
understood now —two cylindre, eh? —I make
the note. Where for I send, yes?’ asked
the wretched one.
“To me, to me,” I yelled hoarsely. “Me,
captain transporto Aromatic. Zeus, quick,
eg-dum, julde- jou!” I added rapidly. “Ship
leave to-mor” —I was inspired. ' ivfanana !
Manana! !” I bawled.
“Allri, sair, manana; ter-nigh’ ’e comes,
then,” I heard with relief. “Much tanks,
eh, bueno sara, sair, eh?”
“Bueno be damned!” I burst out.
“Manana,” I say. “No forget now, julde,
laheo, tres-jolie—savee, eh?”
We were cut off. The Chief looked at me
curiously—he is not a linguist.
We now hied us to a ship-chandlery kept
by one Ashrafi —Ashbag for convenience.
We appointed him interpreter and forthwith
bore him off to the railway station. Al-
though it is only a few hours’ rail from port
Nuffzed, we were informed that our con-
signment wouldn’t arrive until very late.
“Possibly the trains take a siesta in the
heat of the day, too?” I ventured to the
drowsy station-master. As he mumbled
“Yees —non,” and dozed off with a fly on
his nose, I came away speculating.
To facilitate matters we raised Ashbag
to the dignity of agent. He was to fetch
the stuff off while we got ship ready to get
under weigh immediately it arrived.
Late that night . a launch puffed itself
across the moonlit bay. Ashbag stepped on
board. I rushed down to the gangway.
“Well,” I asked, “all right now, Ashbag?
llcw much piastre, eh?”
“’Ow much wot, eh, surr?” queried the
Egyptian.
“Ammonia, man,” I said.... expenses,
launch hire, backsheesh, everything, eh?”
“Harmonium? Harmonium?” said the
agent, as though he’d never heard such a
word before. “Bimebye, maybe termorrer,
yes!” he added blandly.
“What, not come to-night?” I gasped.
“Come ternigh’? Wlia’ for ternigh’, eh?”
he said with serene indifference.
I burst.
“No good cargo tren —no good, I say, he
continued. “If ’e comes passinggur tren,
eh — a ileri —two, three hours ; but cargo
tren?” —he shrugged his shoulders and
blinked his swivel eye—“maybe two, three
del vs oh
I made a mental calculation. “That’s
barely two knots an hour,” I said contemp-
tuously, “and it ain’t here yet!”
Ashbag assumed an expression . which
seemed to infer his absolute guiltlessness in
respect to railway management.
We banked fires and turned in fuming. On
the morning of the third day we arose be-
times and set out once more on the ammonia
trail. Antonio greeted us with glad tidings ;
the elusive stuff was at the station! We
dashed off to the chandlery.
Ashbag snored peacefully, al fresco, in a
chair tilted against the wall of his emporium.
It seemed a pity to disturb him, but our
hearts were hardened. He waddled after
us, blinking stupidly in the glare. >
The station-master had had a trying morn-
ing. He was squatting on the edge of the
platform leaning against a signal post. Open-
mouthed, he slent. His fez had slipped over
one eye, and his hands lay listlessly in the
dust. The stained butt of a cigarette de-
pended from his lower lip and ash bestrewed
his person. Ashbag’s hoarse and fearsome
lingo brought him round a little. We re-
peated our mission. The official displayed

THE WORKER S FRIEND
Keeps Zam-Buk Always in his
Camp Outfit.
MEDICINE chest is a downright necessity in
thousands of Australasian homes, espeei-
ally those out in the Backblocks, far away
from town and medical facilities, and no medicine
chest is complete without its pot of Zam-Buk,
the healing balm that is always ready for use
when a cut, bruise, sprain, burn or scald calls for
instant treatment. Mr. I). Moore, Chapel Street,
Marrickville, Sydney, writes: —“My experiences
with Zam-Buk have been varied and highly success-
ful. In camp, I carry a medical chest for treating
various mishaps, etc., and Zam-Buk has a promi-
nent place in my ‘first-aid’ outfit. Whilst two
of my chums were wrestling one fell with his
thigh on a tree stump, which inflicted a great
gash some inches long and necessitated several
stitches. After these had been put in I dressed
the wound with Zam-Buk, which proved soothing
and beneficial. Before long the man was able to
resume work and the wound was completely healed.

often gets the skin taken off his hands. Dirt

getting into the sores sets up festering, but he always applies Zam-Buk..
which subdues the inflammation and restores his hands to perfect
condition.
“One day, when using a tomahawk, I chopped the top of my thumb to
the bone, severing the nail. I thought I should lose the tip of my thumb,
but it was marvellous how quickly Zam-Buk healed the injury and how
splendidly it took the pain away. AVe, therefore, use Zam-Buk for all our
injuries.”

m> interest beyond mumbling something
about it being at Zeus.
“Zeus!” I cried, “why, isn’t this Zeus,
man?”
Ashbag explained in his pidgin gabble that
this was the branch station of the port —
Zeus was two miles away. After much per-
suasion the railway chap agreed to ring up
Zeus. He leaned for a while on the tele-
phone and dozed. We couldn’t raise a pin
between us. A heavy nod brought his fat
head into violent contact with the bell spike.
Then he came to. Our stuff was not at
Zeus station !
We tore across to the Transport Office.
The senior officer was closeted with a mili-
tary official. We intruded, apologised and
reported progress. The bell button was
pressed, but Antonio was —perhaps conveni-
ently—missing. The military chap naively
remarked that as so many troop trains were on
the move it was improbable that the goods
train would get through that night. We
thanked him and withdrew.
With indomitable perseverance we returned
to the station.
“Where is the goods train?” I demanded
of the railway person.
“’Ow will I know, then?” he replied.
“Then in the name of all the fez-
topped Allahs,” I shouted, “who is the boss,
big-dog, burra-sahib of this railway?”
The sleepy one reflected. “Oh, treffick
man’jer, I tink, eh?” he said.
“All right then,” I ordered, “produce
him !”
To my surprise he saveed. He escorted
me round the dockside to where troops were
disembarking from transports and entraining.
By dint of divers short cuts under trucks,
stumbles over points and climbs up and
down carriage steps we discovered a large
topee, underneath which was a sallow-faced
Englishman.
I explained my predicament. He glanced
over the railway policy I held.
“Oh, that stuff is in Zeus,” he said sweep-
ingly.
“How so, sir?” I asked, wondering by
what occult means he arrived at this con-
clusion.
“Why, the docket says so,” he addeu
lamely.
“Are you the traffic-manager?” I asked
civilly enough.
He looked at me strangely.
“Look ! I’ve been at this hide-and-seek
racket for two days now,” I continued reck-
lessly. “You know less about it than I
do.”
“Then it can’t have left Port Nuffsed,” he
answered sharply, and hopped into a first-
class apartment.
I pursued him, but he was too preoccupied
manipulating a fly-switch for further argu-
ment. Suddenly a whistle shrilled, coup-
lings rattled startlingly, a jolt, and the train
was off. I leapt overboard and cannoned
off a coal stack against another fezzed offi-
cial.
The boss flung back through the departing
window: “See my man there about it!”
A rivulet of lukewarm sweat coursed down
my spine as we plodded back to the station.
In the absence of a manager I felt it incum-
bent upon me to assume the reins of office.
“Do you happen to know anything about a
mislaid goods train?” I asked of my new
assistant.
“It was ’ave arrive last night, I tink,” he
replied foolishly.
“Holy Smoke!” I roared. “Here,” I said
deliberately—l could barely control myself—
“you send telegram now, egdum, every sta-
tion on line....find out. . . .savee?”
He was surprised. “Much telegram, then,
sair—you pay very much piastre, eh?” he
inferred coolly.
“Me pay!” I retorted, ungrammatically
indignant.
• “All right,” I said, “I pay for telegram
and you pay for keep ship here two days,
eh ?”
His mustardy face wrinkled into a sickly
smile. Before leaving him I supervised the
dispatch of six telegrams. We then mooned
about the sultry seaport for two wretched
hours. Our forlorn efforts had produced a
distressing ennui which Ashbag skilfully dis-
pelled with long beers.
The telegram campaign was quite a suc-
cess. We soon possessed positive information
as to where the goods train wasn’t! After a
brief logical discussion it was clear to us
that as the train was at no station it obvi-
viously must be somewhere else. Having
unanimously arrived at this conclusion —and
setting aside a disquieting suggestion that
the stuff mightn’t be on that train after all
-—I left the Chief at the agency while I went
off to prepare the ship once more for sea.
At a late and mystic hour the stilly night
air was rent by sounds of subdued profanity.
Curtailed slumber is not conducive to good
temper. A raucous-voiced A.B. grumbled
something about a 3f-inch strop beine too
light for the job.
„, < r^oo light be ,” said an irate bo’sn.
“ ’Ook on below there, you black cow!”
Intermingled with the marine growling
could be heard the Chief Officer’s tuneful
tenor directing operations. A sorry soul
urged one Ginger to clap on to the
tackle, and let’s get away from this rotten
Gawd-forsaken hole! In due course two
weighty, elongated, iron-bound cases were
somehow dragged inboard over the rail. They
slid with a dull ring to the deck.
The “agent’s” iniquitous account being
settled, he backed his launch round and
churned away shorewards.
The windlass rattled up the mud-hook,
and the transport steamed silently out to
sea.
CATHEAD.
Snodgepan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ORDINARILY I am not a vicious or
spiteful sort of bloke. I like horses
and dogs, and am kind to spiders. I
might brush a cockroach off. but I always
see that he falls in a soft place. I would
rather kill a sub-editor than the feathered
houri of a hen harem for the Sunday feed.
But as for Snodgepan—the man makes me
feel murderous every time 1 see him.
Isn’t the name enough? Snodgepan! It
isn't lit for any decent man, and I hate it
almost as much as I hate its owner. Oh,
the little fool he is! Why wasn’t he made
a woman? He works behind a counter in
a big store in “the city,” selling, I think,
kitchen towels and similar things. He
works hard and long for little, and mustn’t
sit down on the chairs which are supposed
to be provided for him even when business
is slack. Yet the idiot votes Liberal!
That’ll show you what he is. He oughtn’t
to be an Australian, which he is, but a little
London clerk, sneaking through life and liv-
ing like a worm in a Bloomsbury third-floor
back. Snodgepan talks of the emporium
which employs him as “our house.” lie
speaks in tones of awe of “the boss.” For
shopwalkers he has an absolute veneration.
You’ve only got to look at him. He has a
large, foolish nose on his small, putty face.
His chjn recedes so much that his Adam’s
apple, which is also ridiculously large, can’t
move forward. His mouth is weak. His
eyes are a fadeaway-blue, and they bulge
and water. He is short and slim. His
hands are like a woman’s. Sometimes I
think he is a woman. If so, he is a cat. I
loathe him.
Now, you will be astonished to know that
Snodgepan is a regular patron of prize-
fights. It is too damned absurd for anything
that a little effeminate of his sort should joy
at a man v. man battle. He ought to faint
at the sight of blood, but he doesn’t. He
stamps and cackles, and claps his puny,
womanish hands while his eyes bulge and
water with excitement. I know, for I have
seen him. Fancy him applauding the spec-
tacle of two huskies beating each other up !
Why, he is the biggest coward I know of.
I believe he would flee from an aggressive
meat-pie. He locks every window and door
in his house at night for fear of thieves. If
you tread on his doormat, back or front, his
house jingles and clatters with burglar-
alarms, which I’ll bet frighten the soul out
of his little doll’s body when he’s inside. In
a drawer of his dressing-table, at his bed-
side, he keeps a revolver. He wouldn’t be
game to even touch the trigger, let alone pull
it. Yet he is a prizefight fanatic. The squib
is a mystery. I’d like to solve him by
putting him under a train.
Why all this? What harm is there in
Snodgepan? What has he done to me?
Well, he inflicts himself upon me. Business
takes me to the fights regularly, and Snodge-
pan, who lives near me,* makes this an
excuse for pursuing me and drumming fight-
talk into my ear. I never wanted to kno-w
the runt, but he is a friend of my father’s and
for months has more or less frequented our
home. Never at any time had I liked the
look of Snodgepan, and I like him less by
a good deal now that I do know him. One
night, however, I had to meet him. I made
him squeal like a girl when our hands met.
He almost wept. “By Jove, you’ve got a
hard grip,” he moaned. I didn’t say any-
thing. I just grunted. But he was not
annoyed. In a few minutes he was chatting
and chattering and chummering at me. Of
course, it was about fights and fighters.
Snodgepan’s talk includes referees, mana-
gers, promoters, punches, weight-limits, cuts-
of-the-gate and new training methods. Each
Saturday night sees him among the audi-
ence at the scrap. If there’s a contest on
any other night, he’s there, too. He waits
outside for the doors to open and then
rushes to get a good seat. After the go he
waits outside to see the contestants emerge,
for in his eyes they are gods and their
thick-eared henchmen demigods.
There is no escaping him. And yet there
is no insulting him either. I have said to
him several times, “You blanky fool, Snodge-
pan, you must be an idiot to be ceaselessly
talking about boxing. Drop it, or people’ll
take you for a madman.” He only sim-
pered. “Oh,” tittered he, “I like the game !”
Him like the game—him, with “physical
degenerate” stamped all over him !
On my way down to the station he will
come pattering after me, with his absurd
little lunch-bag. Then I get nothing but
fight, fight, fight in the ear all the way to
the train. I manage to evade him at times
on that walk to the station, but he gets me
so often that I fear that Snodgepan must
go to either Rookwood or Waverley, or I
must go to Gladesville or Callan Park.
He travels first-class and I travel second,
but yet, coming home from Sydney at night,
he will fasten to me. Why he does it the
Lord only knows. He must walk right
through the carriages from the first-class end
of the train to see if I am aboard. The
passengers see merely an insignificant,
stunted chit of a man approaching me in the
mincing way a curate approaches a young
lady member of the church choir. My
point of view, however, is different. My
imagination makes Snodgepan out to be an
ogre bearing down on his helpless victim.
What am I to do? I can’t get up and run
away from him through the carriages. Per-
haps I might try it and just let him catch
up to me as I get on to one of the platforms
of the cars. There it would be an easy
matter to throw him off the train. But
there are too many passengers looking.
I see him coming—watch him, fascinated.
That is when I am sitting with my back to
the engine. But I do not always sit that
way, and therefore I do not always see
Snodgepan creep upon me. lam never easy
in my mind that he is not aboard the train
until we are two stations away from Sydney.
Sometimes we will just be leaving Redfern.
I hear the carriage door open and shut. I
sit in fear and trembling. I pray it may be
the ticket-collector coming through and not
him —not him ! Someone is coming down
the corridor. Whoever it is sits in the seat
behind me. There is a pause, during which
I sweat with apprehension. I know it is
only a__pause, though it seems like 14 decades
and 8< leap years. Then I hear a hideous
voice“ Did you think it was a fake. Satur-
day night?” My nerves jangle and go mad
and seem to fall into the pit of my stomach
with a dull, meatful thud. It is "the voice
of that hellish Snodgepan. He is a friend —
a friend who sells kitchen-towels, but ought
to be a tailor for ladies, or an actor’s dresser,
or something else that rouges itself.
My arms are thick and strong. I out-
weigh Snodgepan by at least three stone.
I could kill him in at most two hits. One
day I’ll do it.
