Kalcolor* gives a superb finish to buildings
such as the Reserve Bank, Adelaide. But
architects know that there is more to this
revolutionary but well-tried process than pure
aesthetics. As well as being an anodic colour
system it provides extra resistance to abrasion
and corrosion. And Kalcolor aluminium,
introduced to Australia by Comalco, is not only
light-fast but comprises a striking new range of
architectural colours:
Gold, Light Bronze, Bronze, Statuary Bronze,
Grey, Black.
For the Reserve Bank, Adelaide, Perry Metal
Window Company fabricated both bronze and
light bronze Kalcolor aluminium for windows,
street frontage and entrance areas, external
sunscreen and lift lobby screens.
If it’s a question of architectural aluminium
and Kalcolor in particular call upon the
practical experience of Comalco.
Kalcolor aluminium is available through Comalco
and the sole licensed processor,
Aluminium Anodisers Pty. Limited.

BOAC is always poking its
nose into other peoples affairs
It’s logical when you consider our world-wide jet route covers
214,674 statute miles! And the fact that we fly to more places,
more often than any other airline in the world.
Take London.
We fly in and out of London more than 250 times a week from
all over the world.
In fact, we’re a familiar sight in most great cities of the world—
with our Rolls Royce powered 707’s and VClO’s. BOAC is
the biggest airline in the world outside of the USA and
the USSR.

“What’s Brahms doing
on a dictating
machine?”
Most dictating machines don’t reproduce
music too well because they have 1 speed
only, for words.
The National RQISBS has a 1 7 4 i-P-s.
speed for dictation, plus a faster 3% speed
for finer musical effects.
And when headphones aren’t being used,
sound pours forth from a large 6" cabinet
speaker, not a tiny one in the mike. The
National plays longer, too. Its “auto-
reverse” gives 3 hours’ playing time, so it’s
ideal for meetings or long play classics
sessions at h6me. And when you’re dictat-
ing, you can switch to “auto-voice” to
capture your words and not your pauses.
So why lavish more on a 1-speed dictating
machine? $189.95 buys you a National 2-
speed, 9 transistor RQISBS tape recorder,
that does much more.

“Freaks and Monsters”
Sir,
I was bewildered to read your edi-
torial “Freaks and Monsters” (8., Jan.
14) and am at a loss as to whether
you should be awarded ten for opti-
mism or stupidity. Communism as a
recommended form of .organisation
apart, you are doing yourselves and
Australia a grave disservice by taking
refuge in an opium-inspired dream
vision of the Chinese tragedy. You
state that: “China’s economic per-
formance under the Communists has
also been a terrible failure,” but
according to figures published in “The
Far Eastern Economic Review” (a
highly respected publication), between
1963 and 1965 total Chinese foreign
trade increased by 28 percent from
$U.5.2455m. to $3138m.
Although China’s foreign trade is
still small, one can hardly call these
figures evidence of chronic failure. It
is worth remembering, too, that dur-
ing 1965 Peking made final payment
on its debts to the U.S.S.R., and early
last year the West German Government
approved a DM35Om. credit guarantee
to German firms in an international
consortium planning to set up a steel
processing plant in China. In addition
can be mentioned China’s trade with
Africa, the eagerness with which
British and Western European firms
go galloping off to Peking at the least
suggestion of a contract, and China’s
growing aviation industry. It is
reported that in 1964 passengers and
freight by air increased 38 percent and
eight percent respectively, and the bro-
chure of the General Administration of
Civil Aviation lists 46 internal air
routes linking more than 70 cities.
You also state that China is increas-
ingly isolating herself from the world.
Last September Air France began a
regular air service between Paris and
Shanghai the first between a West-
ern country and China. This year,
Italy and China are to exchange exhi-
bitions. Last September, the British
Scientific Instruments Manufacturers
Association held an exhibition in Tien-
tsin; and the Danes are at present
negotiating for a suitable venue in
which to stage their proposed exhibi-
tion of capital goods next March. Last
September, the British-built synthetic
ammonia plant near Luchow in
Szechuan started production, and the
adjoining Dutch unit was due to begin
operations shortly afterward. From
this evidence (and there is much more
available) I would say that it is THE
BULLETIN and not China that is
following a policy of deaf isolation.
Compare China with India. Both
countries have faced severe food prob-
lems, both have enormous populations,
and both are struggling with ancient
cultures which hamper industrial and
economic progress in the 20th century.
The difference is that China is able'
to buy food in a time of crisis, but
India cannot. This seems to me an
important field in which to be suc-
cessful.

The “Broken” Drought
Sir,
I speak for many men on the land
when I say it is as irritating to repeat-
edly read in THE BULLETIN that
“the drought * has broken” as to listen
to the radio announce that the weekend
is expected to be fine.
Unfortunately the weather pattern is
developing much along the lines of the
past eight years, in which no soaking
rain fell. So the drought “breaks” only
here and there.

Subversion in the USSR
Sir,
The article by Alexander Bregman
on the Russian emigre groups NTS
(8., Jan. 14) contained surprising
assertions. Quite opposite evaluations
of NTS were confirmed, among others,
by Leon Goure of the Rand Corpora-
tion in the March-April, 1960, issue
of “Problems of Communism.” He
described NTS as “a political organisa-
tion with strong Fascist and totalitarian
leanings, and with a record of prewar
and wartime collaboration with the
Nazis. Since 1945 it has sought Western
support through exaggerated, if not
wholly false, claims of controlling
underground operations within the
Soviet Union.”

Dairy Subsidies
Sir,
Your reference in “Subsidies after
the Elections” (8., Dec. 10) to the
Australian Primary Producers’ Union
seeking an increase in the Dairying
Subsidy to s6om. is a gross overstate-
ment which must be placed in per-
spective.
The Dairy Industry Five Year Stabi-
lisation Plan proposed by the APPU
retains the existing Federal Government
subsidy adjusted to its 1958 real mone-
tary value of s27m. per annum. Such
an adjustment involves an amount
slightly more than half the figure of
s6om. quoted in your article.
This adjustment is calculated by re-
lating movements in the consumer price
index, the basic wage, and average
weekly earnings over the period 1958-
1967 to the 1958 subsidy figure. Whilst
wages have increased by 33 percent
the overall return on butter per cwt.
has declined 6 percent and the sub-

... until NCR produced
the 500!
Many businesses are not getting the benefits of electronic data
processing because they think that computers are too compli-
cated, too costly. Now the NCR.SOO knocks down every computer
prejudice with a simple, low-cost, easy-to-program magnetic
card system.
With the NCR 500 magnetic card system you
start computing for less than $BOO per month.
The 500 enables you to use the visible records
with which you are already familiar, yet gives you
all the speed, versatility and power to grow of a
real stored-program computer.
The cards have printed entries on one side, mag-
netic stripe “memories” on the other. Your staff
can read them—and so can the 500. You get the
best of both worlds!
As your business grows, your 500 system can be
expanded to take on more work and do it even
faster and better. There is a wide range of
peripherals, including punched tape and punched
card input/output units and a line printer. You
can add any of them to the 500 at any time
during its long working life.
This means you can choose a system that is fully
utilised on current work, yet be sure that the 500
will keep pace with your data processing needs
for many years ahead.
Above all the NCR 500 is a real computer. It
stores programs in its memory, has all the
flexibility of many bigger, far costlier computers.
Yet programming effort is measured in man-days
and not man-years!
The NCR 500 removes the last barrier to com-
puter use even in the smallest business. Talk
500 computing with NCR —and see at last how
simple and right for your business a real com-
puter can be!

The APPU plan also makes pro-
vision for more finance for essential
export market development through
levies raised to one cent per lb. butter-
fat.
Other features of the APPU plan
are —
Rationalisation of farming with long-
term loan assistance; rejuvenation of
the Australian Dairy Produce Board;
a realistic policy on margarine; in-
clusion of a value for solids other than
butterfat in the calculations of the re-
jturn paid to the producer; an increase
'in the Government underwritten initial
payment to primary producers to 40
cents per lb. butterfat; rationalisation
(of manufacturing facilities; retention of
l the bounty to assist the export of pro-
cessed milk products.
This plan has been endorsed by dairy
farmers throughout Australia and is a
realistic assessment of the strengths and
weaknesses that exist at present in the
dairying industry.

Helping the Forgers
I Sir,
The continued refusal of the Gover-
nor of the Reserve Bank (Dr. Coombs)
to recompense citizens who unwittingly
accept a forged $lO note is seriously
hampering the efforts of the police to
apprehend the forger. As you so rightly
pointed out (8., Jan. 7) the average
citizen and shopkeeper will, under the
present circumstances, cautiously await
his chance to pass on any forgery he
discovers in his possession rather than
personally bear the loss of $lO.
If Dr. Coombs were to honor all
forged $lO notes handed to the police
the public’s co-operation would be
secured and the forger much more
traced. Such a move would also
[result in all forgeries in circulation be-
|ing quickly removed.
R. W. PARRY

Trans field Sculpture Prize
Sir,
| In his letter (8., Jan. 7) Elwyn
Tynn again stated that I “preferred the
[more traditional materials that were
[predominant in the exhibition” for the
[Transfield Sculpture Prize to “some
modern experiments” although I had
corrected (8., Dec. 3) statements in
'his review. To justify his “feeling” he
quoted a paragraph of the Introduction.
May I point out that the paragraph
lis about methods, not materials. Mr.
'Lynn may read what I wrote about
(materials in the two succeeding para-
graphs. Over 16 different materials
were for 37 exhibits. Though
many conventional approaches could be
distinguished, the word traditional is
inappropriate. The paragraph was
quoted out of context. It should have
been read in the light of its preceding
sentence, “If an artist becomes too
aware of this he may be tempted to
adjust his art to the viewer rather
than persisting in his own vision.”
Read in the light of this sentence, the
paragraph shows a common factor
behind seemingly diverse recent exhi-
bitions. The paragraph attempts to strip
these exhibitions of their superficial
claims to modernity and excellence so
that a more considered evaluation can
be made, both of them and of the
Transfield Prize Exhibits, which, by
the way, were not completely free of
the factor mentioned.

The Anti-Star System
Sir,
Without wishing to upset Mr. Edwin
Ride, whom I remember as a very nice
chap, I really cannot have him passing
judgment (8., Jan. 28) on the Austra-
lian theatrical profession. Mr. Ride will
surely agree that his theatrical career
was this: he left the Diplomatic Service
with stars in his eyes to play in
“The Sentimental Bloke,” played it but
adequately, and returned to the cosy
security of the Diplomatic. This
scarcely qualifies him to comment pub-
licly on a profession to which he never
really belonged, especially when he
compares his present professionalism to
ours.

NO OTHER
TAPERED ROLLER BEARING CAN
MAKE THIS STATEMENT
Made in Australia. Cups and cones of tapered roller
bearings are made by Australian Timken Pty. Ltd.
They’re perfectly interchangeable with other Tim-
ken bearing cups and cones produced in any of the
12 Timken Company bearing plants. That’s preci-
sion, carried right around the world.
We started in Ballarat, Victoria, in 1958, importing
semi-finished components, and finishing and in-
specting them here to the Timken Company stan-
dards. By gradually extending the plant, adding
buildings and installing the finest possible equip-
merit, each year we were able to increase the local
Australian content. Today Timken bearings, Made
in Australia, are a reality. A great feeling.
And since 1958, our sales and service engineers
have been everywhere from Port Hedland to Towns-
ville, helping people in all phases of industry who
have a need for bearing know-how. If you have prob-
lems, we’ll be glad to help you. Just give us a call.
Now let’s say it again! Made in Australia by Aus-
tralia’s only tapered roller bearing manufacturer.
Sounds good, doesn’t it?

The Sheep’s Back
Sir,
Your dear confused Croesus may
know money, but not the wool indus-
try. Perhaps I should be grateful for
his suggestion that every Australian
should read my book, “On The Sheep’s
Back,” but instead I am gravely wor-
ried that they will scan it with the
same lack of attention and deep-rooted
preconceptions revealed in your review.
Did Croesus really read my book, or
merely skim through it (between
annual reports) in avid search for
arrows to launch against the hated foe,
Sir William Gunn? He accuses me of
getting too close to my subject in the
form of the Wool Board and the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat. On the evi-
dence presented in his review, the wool
industry he claims to know bears little
resemblance to the one I attempt to
describe in the 268 pages of “On The
Sheep’s Back.”

Against the Market
Sir, ' ~ ;
Britain’s renewed attempt to join the
Common Market is tragic and doubly
frustrating, as many supported Labor
at the last election because we were
against the Conservative policy to turn
away from the Commonwealth and
submerge us in Europe. We were
happy when the first attempt failed,
and now the horror is on us again.
Many still don’t realise the full
implications of the Treaty of Rome.
The more governments and pressure
groups try to separate us politically
and economically from the Common-
wealth (and it is obvious that an
attempt is being made to do this) the
more it behoves individuals to cherish
the personal links, for the Common-
wealth is one of peoples. Hence this
letter, offering a warm handshake of
friendship to Australia from an English-
woman who cares.

Ned Kelly's “Chivalry "
Sir,
lan Jones’ attempt to defend our
“Folk Hero”(?) Ned Kelly (8., Jan.
14) was appallingly inaccurate. Far
from spending “fours hours in the scrub
badly wounded,” Kelly was captured
immediately he was wounded in the
legs by Sergeant Steele. He fell almost
immediately he was hit, and Steele and
a constable rushed forward and dis-
armed him of his two heavy revolvers
and handcuffed him.
His “magnificent attempt to rescue
his mates” is laughable. All the evidence
points to the fact that Ned abandoned
his mates and sneaked out the back
door of the old pub to where the gang’s
horses had been tethered, intending to
escape. The police, however, had been
there first, and the gang’s horses had

Your Easter pictures will be
quality pictures with a
Kodak Instamatic
500
camera
Here’s why. The ‘‘soo" has a built-in elec-
tric eye that gives you the correct exposure
for daylight pictures no guesswork, no
film wastage. Its colour-corrected 38mm
Schneider Xenar f/2.8 lens and Compur
Special shutter (up to 1/500th sec.) give
you needle-sharp pictures every time. When
not in use, the lens barrel retracts into
the slim camera body.
For flash shots with the Kodak Instamatic
SQO camera, you just pop a flashcube onto
the special adapter ... and flash! flash!
flash! flash! ... you can take four flash
pictures, in seconds, without changing
flashbulbs. No fumbling or fussing with a
new bulb for every shot.
Naturally, the camera loads instantly with
pre-loaded cartridges of Kodachrome-X,
Kodacolor-X, Kodak Ektachrome-X or Veri-
chrome Pan films. Whether you use colour
or black-and-white film, the Kodak Instam-
atic 500 camera automatically adjusts itself
for the type of film in use.

they were shot there and then) to
prevent the gang’s escape.
Fifty yards of track had been torn
up by the Kelly gang and fettlers
forced to do the work at gunpoint. It
was the gang’s intention to stand around
the resultant train-wreck and shoot
every man, police or blacktracker, who
climbed out of the wreck. But for the
courage and determination of the local
schoolteacher, Curnow, who stopped
the leading pilot engine and the police

of helpless, injured men would have
taken place. A fine generous, chivalrous

Less Grandiose Opera
Sir,
A smaller opera stage and audi-
torium would have advantages over a
larger one. It would be easier to fill,
and thus to create a more festive
atmosphere; the repertoire could be
smaller, with repeat performances of
the same operas; there would be fewer
imported artists because of the lower
revenue, and this would foster native
talent and tradition. The sets could be
cheaper, there would be fewer extras,
the orchestra would be smaller. Most
operas have been performed creditably
in the opera houses of Europe, mostly
smaller than the proposed hall, seating
1500 people.

“The 51st State"
Sir,
Mr. Peter Samuel has not included
in “The 51st State” (8., Dec. 3) one
aspect of the situation, which he may
not know—that U.S. capital invested
in Australia is subject to American
law economic dominance is followed
by political dominance. Suppose an
American company domiciled in Aus-
tralia wanted to export a non-strategic
product to Cuba. Australian law would
allow it but American law would
not. American law could fine and
imprison the principals of the parent
American company. The fines could
amount to something like $500,000 plus
up to five years in prison. So the
word is quietly passed out withdraw
your bid, do not ship or else apply
for a licence from the American
Government with the certain knowledge
the licence would neither be refused nor
granted. Does this sound fantastic? It
is incontrovertibly true. There are
many companies in which U.S. capital
is invested in countries of the world,
and those companies may not ship to
“designated” areas without consent of
the U.S. Government, regardless of
what the laws of that country may
state.

Queensland’s “Dinah” brought heavy

FEBRUARY 11, 1967
More Than a Pretty Face
A T the time of going to Press
the new Labor Party leader is
still to be elected. But one thing is
certain: whoever he is, it will not
matter much unless a lot of things
happen.
The challenge is obviously there
for a man with the stuff of leader-
ship in him. Few nobler honors
may be won in Australia than to
follow in the tradition of men like
Scullin, Curtin, or even Chifley.
Yet the present candidates are a
middling lot or worse. We may
still hope that the new leader of
the Opposition will face the truth
about the Party and take the
necessary hard measures to restore
it to its proper place in the national
life but the hope is a slight one.
The plain fact is that in the
crucial areas of foreign affairs and
defence there is not one Labor
Party but two. It is also a fact
that a strategically placed and
well-directed minority of witless
radicals, front-lawn revolutionaries,
and Communist agents has
strangled the Party organisation
and paralysed its will. It is further
a fact that unless the Labor Party
is purged, cleansed, and healed
soon it will pass beyond the point
of recovery and wither to a squalid
death.
There is no time for nonsense
about new images, pretty faces,
and regular visits to the barber.
The new leader of Federal parlia-
mentary Labor must realise that
most of the electorate does not
want his Party and it does not
want him. It is hostile to the
Party’s foreign policy and bored
by the Party’s pretences about
radicalism, but it can be wooed
and won by imaginative economic
plans, by proposals for social
reform, and by democratic anti-
Communism.
The country needs an alternative
ruling Party willing to re-examine
our national priorities and to
sponsor economic and social justice.
It needs an Opposition to shake
the complacent and dull men out
of the present political establish-
ment. But it will never accept a
Party whose organisation is manip-
ulated in many States by the hire-
lings of the Communists and whose
Federal leadership is subservient ter
back-room agitators.
If the new leader really wants
to win the Treasury benches he
must see what Britain’s Hugh
Gaitskell saw in 1960, that his
power lies basically in Caucus.
With Mr. F. E. Chamberlain back;
on the Federal Executive there
will be little hope of making
changes elsewhere. The power of
Caucus must be used to crush the
Victorian ALP Executive and its
network of agents, especially in
Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia; to make major policy
changes in defence and foreign
affairs; and to raise rank-and-file
power to equality with that of the
unions. The extreme Left must be
forced to either break away or shut;
up and men of the calibre of Cap-
tain Benson, Senator McManus
and their allies must be brought
back into the Party on suitable
terms.
All of these things are clear to*
many Australians. The new leader-
will no doubt have the intelligence
to see them. But will he have the
heart to act?


THIS AUSTRALIA
Liberals and the Radical Right
From ALAN REID in Canberra
Just as Labor has to watch for the strengthening of authoritarianism from the
Left, a non-Labor Party has to guard against the infiltration of authoritarianism
from the Right.
The danger becomes more acute when
the non-Labor grouping (a) is the
Government, (b) has a large majority
(which tends to produce complacency),
and (c) is confronted by an enfeebled
and demoralised Parliamentary Oppo-
sition.
The Liberal Party confronts a situa-
tion which meets all these criteria.
Under the leadership of Prime Minister
Holt, it furnishes the more numerous
and significant section of the Liberal-
Country Party coalition now in office
Federally for another three years. With
its Country Party partners (20 voting
members), it had with its own 61
members of the House of Representa-
tives a majority of 39 over the Opposi-
tion which now numbers only 41. What-
ever the outcome of the Labor leader-
ship in Canberra this week, Labor is
few in numbers and human nature
Being what it is is not likely to pick up
in morale for a while even under the
most enlightened and energetic of
leaders.
The Liberal Party is healthily recog-
nising the position that it is in and is
trying to build up an atmosphere in
which the Party will not become sus-
ceptible to infiltration from the Right.
The Federal Liberal president, Mr. J. E.
(“Jock”) Pagan, was the first to grasp
the nettle and sound a warning in his
farewell address as retiring N.S.W.
State president of the Liberal Party.
Pagan made it clear that the Liberal
Party’s victory at the Federal polls
should not be regarded as or allowed
to develop into a victory for reaction.
“Electoral support will remain with us
just as long as we continue to earn
it ... We are, and we must remain,
a Party of vigorous social reform. They
(the Australian people) look to the
political parties for intelligent under-
standing and leadership on these great
issues (of development and the Aus-
tralian right to survive and be.free). If
the Liberal Party fails to supply these
qualities it will be defeated and we
shall deserve to be defeated. A poli-
tical party cannot afford to be static
or complacent. An electoral victory is
not a mandate for the status quo.”
The N.S.W. Liberal executive
spelled the dangers from the Right
even more bluntly than Pagan. Warn-
ing that the Holt Government’s huge
majority could be a serious danger
rather than an advantage to the
party if it engendered complacency, the
executive report stated, “Just as the
Liberal Party in the past has learned
to appraise extremism in its various
forms on the Left of the political spec-
trum (Communism) so, too, it must
understand the implications of pres-
sures from the extreme Right.”
The executive conceded the exis-
tence of this extreme Right in Aus-
tralia by describing it as “a phenomenon
(which) while somewhat new to Aus-
tralia has been in existence for some
time in other countries, and notably
in the United States.”
The executive was to some degree
re-echoing a fear that has existed
Chichester leaving Sydney Harbor
within the Liberal Party ever since it
heard the results on election night last
year and realised that it would be
facing a decimated Opposition.
Historically it is within a Party
secured in power by a huge parlia.
mentary majority that an extreme,!
crypto-authoritarian wing tends to
develop. One of the healthiest post- 1
election manifestations has been that
the Liberal publications, apparently
substituting intelligent self-criticism for
the parliamentary Opposition which it
fears will prove ineffective, have been!
voicing warnings to members to be
vigilant. |
The fear apparently extends deeply*
and healthily deep in the ranks of‘
the Party. At a Liberal Youth Council ;
meeting recently the N.S.W. Liberal
secretary, Mr. John Carrick, was asked
bluntly “what danger is there from ■
the Right?”
Carrick told his younger listeners,
that the types that tended to group
on the extreme Right were equally as*
undesirable politically as those
who grouped on the extreme Left. In
some ways the danger of infiltration
from the Right was more real for a;
party like the Liberal Party than the
danger of infiltration from the Left.
In past days it was fashionable to be
Leftist, now it was fashionable to be’
Rightist.
But those at the extremes were usually
the ideologist, the ratbag, the neurotic,*
and subversive. Carrick warned his!
young audience to practise both toler-
ance and vigilance. Within a party
like the Liberal Party there must be]
room* for the widest range of opinion
compatible with the preservation of
personal liberty and the development
of human talents, personality, and
dignity.
B U T the danger from the Right
should be resisted as well as the
dangers from the Left. There should be
a vigilant understanding of what in fact
was being advocated by those on the
extreme Right. Liberals should study
the ideas that were being put forward
and to judge them against the yardstick!
of Liberal values. In this way extremism j
of the Right could be countered as
effectively as extremism of the Left, j
I can understand the Liberal Party’s
worries. They have a crop of new
Parliamentarians, many of them young
and probably impressionable. These
new Parliamentarians will be function-
ing in a Parliament in which the Oppo-|
sition, weak as it has been in recent
years, will probably be weaker.
It is a situation in which without 4
careful vigilance there could be de-
veloped an authoritarian-minded wing
of the Liberal Party, a wing with suf-
ficient numbers to be a real threat to
liberty due to overzealousness and
failure to recognise the long-term effects]
of the things they advocate.
The Liberals have made a good starts
in themselves expressing awareness of
the danger and warning its member-
ship of the undesirability of such a


growth. Over the three years of the
present Parliament it is going to be
interesting to see whether the Party’s
warning is effective, or whether there
develops the authoritarian attitudes
which could turn Pagan’s party of
“vigorous social reform” into a
group dominated or influenced by
reactionaries.

"No wonder it sank we needed a new figurehead."
Teachers’ War
“ Sewer rats” is not an expression
one would normally expect to hear at
a Teachers’ Union conference. It was,
however, only one among many vitu-
perative phrases hurled during last
week’s conference of the Victorian
Teachers’ Union.
The reason why Left-wing delegates
claimed this year’s election campaign
“the filthiest campaign in the history
of the Union” is clear: they thought
they had the presidency won, but at
the last moment it was snatched away.
A few months ago Mr. George Lees,
a former organising committee member
of the 1959 Melbourne Peace Con-
gress, who was being supported for the
presidency of the VTU by a solid bri-
gade of Communists, pro-Communists,
and others of the extreme Left, seemed
certain to win. His opponent, Miss
Hilma Cranley, lacked organisation
and knowledge of the tactics of her
opponents, and many regarded her
reign as president as rather undis-
tinguished.
A campaign based on the attractive
personal qualities of Lees, on threats
to break from the Union, and on the
conservatism of Miss Cranley was
planned and carried by the leaders of
the high schools’ and technical schools’
branches of the VTU. It would almost
certainly have succeeded but for the
intervention of a group of anti-Com-
munist secondary teachers, mostly, it
seems, moderate Labor in their poli-
tics, who published a pamphlet titled
“The Progressive Teacher.”
They brought to the attention of all
schools the strategy of the pro-Com-
munist attempt to capture the VTU,
link with the Communist-led N.S.W.
Teachers’ Federation, affiliate with
Communist fronts, join the Victorian
Labor Party (with the aim of sup-
porting the present Victorian ALP
executive), oppose the American alli-
ance, etc.
On the opening day of the confer-
ence last week this group was joined
by another, mainly primary teachers,
which issued a circular warning dele-
gates that “a concerted campaign has
been planned and waged to subvert the
activities and positions of the Union.”
This primary teachers’ group was bit-
terly abused on the floor of the con-
ference “sewer rats,” etc. and
ironically enough was disowned by the
very conservative leaders whose posi-
tions they were striving to save.
Miss Cranley publicly dissociated
herself from the circular, apparently
because she thought its appearance
would ruin her chances of re-election.
A resolution condemning the pamphlet
was passed by 665 votes to 26, but the
vote was not indicative of too much,
because many delegates were confused
as to which side of the hall to move
for the division. The hall was divided
into two-thirds and one-third instead of
being split down the centre.
However, it did indicate that many
delegates were not prepared to associ-
ate themselves with the anti-Commun-
ists in public. In the event, Miss Cran-
ley defeated Mr. Lees for the presidency
by 373 votes to 338. Without her un-
wanted supporters she would almost
certainly have lost, but the Left
recovered well from its bitterly felt
defeat and countered by deciding to
remove the technical schools’ branch
from the VTU. The high schools’
branch delegates also threatened to re-
sign and form a splinter organisation.
Instead of forcing the Left out in
ignominy, Miss Cranley and her associ-
ates on the VTU council chastely

accepted these moves without demur.
Instead of quickly arranging to con-
tinue "with fresh technical and high
schools’ branches inside the VTU, they
capitulated to the technical branches’
withdrawal and delivered themselves
of honeyed words about arranging for
a new Federation. Such a federation
as the pro-Communists now plan would
allow them to make up a lot of the
ground lost at the conference, a point
which seems entirely lost on some of
the present VTU leadership.
The high schools’ branch breakaway
is not yet certain. Outside the VTO
lurks the powerful non-Communist
Victorian Secondary Teachers’ Associ-
ation. It would be difficult for the Left
to set up a competing organisation.
One possibility open to the Left is an
invasion of the VSTA, but this would
meet fierce opposition.
A combined VTU-VSTA assault
could probably destroy the pro-Com-
munists’ influence for some years, but
on present indications there is not
enough political skill in the leadership
of these unions to carry out such a
task. The teachers seem to have no

BRIAN BUCKLEY
Stopping the Hook-up in W.A.
February 17 is a vital date for Western Australia’s Langley Hancock, who haj
deliberately set himself on a collision course with his State Government over his
plans for re-opening the Wittenoom blue asbestos mine and creating a new industrial
complex in the north-west.
On that day applications close for
two iron ore reserve areas which Han-
cock hoped would be allocated to him,
and which are keystones to his scheme.
The basis of his scheme is 2| years
old, but its details had never been made
known, and it did not have the back-
ing of the State Government. His
recent spectacular
purchase of Witten-
oom and the pub-
licity he created
enabled him to do
his business in a
goldfish bowl in the
hope that public
opinion would carry
him through.
Before the Minis-
ter for the North-
West, Mr. Charles
Court, had returned
to his home State
from a prolonged
stay in South Africa,
Mr. Hancock had
become the mil-
lionaire Robin
Hood doing battle with the Sheriff
of Bureaucracy. But how these two
men, Hancock and Court two
evenly matched men of vision line
up in public estimation is yet to be
seen. For the Hancock plan and the
Court plan, while seeking similar tar-
gets, are radically different, and
Court’s carefully laid plans will not
easily be thrown overboard in favor
of Hancock’s.
First, there is the difference of public
approach. Mr. Court has always liked
to work to a fait accompli later pre-
senting it to Cabinet, and the people;
he detests what he calls “doing business
on a street corner.” Mr. Hancock main-
tains that only by throwing all his cards
on the table can the strength of his
case be seen.
Then there is the physical difference
of the two schemes. Mr. Court has al-
ways sought to duplicate as many rail-
ways and ports as possible, seeing each
as a potential industrial area with its
string of ancillary developments. Mr.
Hancock is more pragmatic and wants
Lang Hancock
to rationalise all northern ore oper-
ations along two interchangeable haul-
age lines, using two huge ports. Han-
cock sees the developments as business
propositions, with the need to cut over-
head by rationalising; Court envisages
the north as a place full of people, liv-
ing proof that Australia can make a go
of it north of Capri—
corn.
Finally, there is a
similarity between
the two men which
strikes sparks. Both
love the area and
saw potential there
long before their
con t e m
Both tend to see a
goal and expect the
red tape to wrap
neatly into place.
But Mr. Court,
being a politician,
must pay more at-
tention to red tape.
For 1 iron - ore
pioneer Lang Han-
cock, the latest move is a tremendous
gesture, for he risks much of the money
he has made from his long series of
discoveries, laying it on the line for
an idea he believes in fervently. No-
body claims for him purely altruistic
motives, but certainly with the kind
of income he has, there is more to it
than a simple business venture.
JTROM the State’s point of view, the
Hancock plan on an outlay of
somewhere around $1.5 million aims
at upsetting their whole structure of
$6.5 million development in the north.
Basically, this is the reason they are
finding ways of not going along with
it. The way they have chosen is to
refuse to reallocate two temporary
iron-ore leases to Mr. Hancock and
his business partner Mr. Peter Wright,
who previously had held them in
partnership with Rio Tinto (before
it became Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation,
parents of CRA).
When he says these leases are funda-
mental to his whole operation, Mr.

Hancock is not speaking out of pique.
For the limonite deposits at Mount
Lockyer, 30 miles south-east of Witte-
noom Gorge, are seen as the bait to
bring in not only an oil refinery, but
the world’s first commercial direct re-
duction plant. Such a process would
upgrade the ore from a 55 percent iron
content to 90 percent or better. It side-
steps the pig-iron process in steel-
making, and on the way uses the fines
the ore dust by agglomerating
them in pellets.
Hancock has spoken of Mobil com-
mitting themselves to setting up a re-
finery, but now adds that, Esso would
be interested to come in with their
direct reduction process which is under
test at a U.S. pilot plarft, in a package
deal.
He would mine the ore and sell it
to Esso for processing, using their own
oil. Then they would sell it back to
him in a processed state for shipment.
He was able to bring the oil-flies
around by getting the Cape Lambert
installations that had belonged to Aus-
tralian Blue Asbestos. These are the
only bulk installations in the area,
and became a key bargaining point.
The shipment would most likely be
done by Daniel K. Ludwig’s National
Bulk Carriers Inc., getting the ore not
only to Japan where Ludwig has most
of his shipbuilding operations, but also
to the U.S. and Europe in his mam-
moth carriers.
That would not be the end. Mr.
Hancock says he has options over a
new asbestos refining technique, being
developed within Australia, which
would double the output from the
same amount of fibre and rock.
Wittenoom would be made economi-
cal again by cheap shipping, as well as
a railway haulage line running past
the scarps of the Hamersley Range
down the Fortescue Valley, enabling the
power lines and so on to be strung
from one gorge to the next, as each
was mined out. But here again he
smells deliberate frustrations, for Dale’s
Gorge, one of the six in the chain he
seeks, is not to be made available to
him having too high a tourist potential.
So much for the new operations, but
Hancock points out also that Mt.
Newman could hook up with his line
instead of going through Port Hedland,
and Mt. Goldsworthy could use it also,
after their present mine is finished, and
they move to Weeli Wooli near Mt.
Newman; he also hopes to have Cliffs
.Western Australia Mining Co. start by
mining the south-eastern corner of their
Robe River desposits instead of the
western end, also hooking up.
The technical and political problems
of such a move would be immense, and
perhaps insurmountable. Cliffs, still at
a delicate negotiating stage, are com-
mitted to using Cape Preston, and
might not change to Cape Lambert even
if they wanted to.
But Hancock, answering those who
have continued to press for multiplicity
of facilities, points out that his proposed
railway and the Mount Tom Price-
Dampier line of Hamersley Iron would
cross, guaranteeing not only against a
clogged line (Hammersley’s Russel T
Madigan has called the Dampier line
virtually limitless in capacity) but
guaranteeing buyers against a port foul-
up. Haulage lines and ports could be
made fully interchangeable.
Foo Flies
It can only be supposed that the
Fly Control Committee of the Muni-
cipal Association of Victoria, with the
full blessing of the State Department
of Health, has adopted a religious
sanction against flies, for science has
found nothing seriously objectionable
about them.
The Fly Committee’s latest onslaught
has been launched with a fusillade of
half a million leaflets and a storm of
radio plugs. Those lucky Melburnians
who can demonstrate sufficiently san-
guine prejudices about flies have a
chance of winning places in a “Ban-the-
flies Quiz” and being rewarded with
luxurious, all-expenses-paid holidays to
other fly-ridden parts of the world.
Nowhere in the literature of science
can one find a single documented in-
stance of flies having caused a human
to become sick. Mosquitoes are proved
purveyors of human disease. So are
lice and fleas among a number of other
known insect vectors of human disease,
but no money, of course, is provided for
the eradication of these insects.
The Chinese, who have largely rid
themselves of flies, have not attributed
any lessening of disease to this accom-
plishment. Dogs and cats are far more
likely to cause human sickness than
flies. By virtue of their strong stomachs,
these animals can tolerate a load of
salmonella bacteria sufficient to kill
several strong men or many old weak
men and children.
It is evident to the layman that if
flies were spreaders of disease, then
Australia would be one of the most
disease-ridden countries on earth. Be-
sides, laymen know that they get
stomach upsets, contract infectious
hepatitis and other complaints fre-
quently attributed to flies in winter-
time when there are no flies.
Volunteers have often eaten food ex-
posed to flies known to be carrying a
certain disease and able to move freely
back and forth between the food and
the source of the disease, and yet these
people have not developed the slightest
trace of infection.
It is possible, of course, that certain
disease-causing organisms could multi-
ply in certain foods left standing long
enough and reach the minimum number
needed to set up an infection. A rea-
sonable anti-fly campaign could be ex-
cused. More than 50 years ago the
British entomologist G. S. Graham-
Smith showed that maggots can be
reared on bacteria, but that the flies
emerging from the pupae are quite
germ free. Yet, still we have to put up
with this nonsense of city councils.


Lessons from Dr. Goh
THE Federal Election and the
subsequent visit of Marshal Ky
revealed that there exists a deep
cleavage between the thinking and feel-
ing of the Australian people and the
attitudes of the visible and audible
sections of the academic intelligentsia.
The majority of Australians tend to
be aware of the Communist threat, and,
determined to resist it, they are in
favor of the American alliance and our
participation in the Vietnam war and
they are prepared to extend a warm
welcome not only to a democratic ally
like LBJ but to Asian allies who are
in the fight with us, even those whose
devotion to parliamentary democracy
is somewhat suspect.
The academic intelligentsia, on the
other hand, tends to be neutralist, pro-
Communist, anti-American, and in
favor only of those Asian leaders who
are dedicated to a policy of cutting
our throats. Pro-Western Asian allies
are dismissed as American agents.
The majority of the academic intelli-
gentsia has, by now, been almost totally
discredited in the eyes of the clini-
cally normal bulk of
the Australian people,
a fact which will
have increasingly
serious repercussions
on the financial and
social positions of
Australian univer-
sities. Since the politics of the Left
is not directed by pragmatic con-
siderations but follows the laws of
dope-addiction you do more and
more of what is destroying you it
is probable that “Left” operations in
universities and elsewhere will grow
rather than diminish in intensity, and
that the gulf between the governments
and the masses on one hand and the
intellectuals on the other will continue
to widen. Any sign that not all of us
are silly or traitorous ratbags is, there-
fore, welcome. The recent Canberra
conference on Asian Communism held
by the Australian Institute of Political
Science may have been such a sign,
judging from the quality of the papers,'
though it may or may not be an acci-
dent that by far the most brilliant
paper was delivered by a man who
is far from being an Australian
academic: Dr. Goh Keng Swee, Singa-
pore’s Defence Minister.
As for the rest of the papers
most of them were intellectually
respectable, though somewhat pallid
and old hat. This may have been be-
cause on the topic of Asian Com-
munism there just isn’t enough relev-
ant empirical information.
The most interesting section of Pro-
fessor Scalapino’s paper was the one
dealing with the present crisis in main-
land China. Scalapino believes that the
present troubles are consequences of the
fact that Liu and Mao found themselves
in the minority on the CC of the
CCP and that they are attempting to
devise alternative means of social con-
trol. Mao and Liu represent Yenanite
primitivism as against the more
sophisticated concepts of Communism
current mainly among revisionising
second-generation Communists who
prefer electronic to washed brains and
technology to enthusiasm. Scalapino
made the vital point that the present
struggle may lead to resuscitation of
Chinese regionalism.
Scalapino acknowledged the failure
of agrarian policies by all Communist
regimes, though he seems to overesti-
mate the “success” of their industriali-
sation projects. To what extent is the
successful creation of a white elephant
whose enormous appetite deprives all
other useful animals of food a “suc-
cess”? Nehru’s heirs in India have a
story to tell about this! Scalapino fore-
sees the emergence of polycentric
Singapore’s Secret Police and the Communists
national Communisms in Asia, whose
power and mischief-making can be con-
tained by setting up a viable balance
of power in the respective regions. He
comes down implicitly in support of
Johnson’s policy of resistance by
limited response in South-East Asia.
J. D. B. Miller, in his paper, was
obviously unable to identify the roots
of Chinese policies in operational terms
and took refuge in such psychologisms
as “National pride” and “Determina-
tion to bend events to China’s will.”
He, too, ended by endorsing, at least
implicitly, the policy of the Johnson
administration as the best way of frus-
trating China’s trouble-making poten-
tial. The question of alleged Chinese
aggressiveness was solved by a linguistic
analysis of the term “aggressive” which
Miller revealed as being partly vague
and partly misleading; a property, alas,
which it shares with all other
empirical concepts, including the con-
cept of a “chair.” And yet, we do
continue to sit on chairs, and we shall
continue to fear Red China’s brutality
and might. There is the inevitable
optimistic anticipation of a happy end:
eventual bourgeoisification of China
will lead it on to paths of revisionism
and peace. Will it? Recently Strausz-
Hupe made the long - overdue
comparison between post-Stalin Russia
and Hohenzollern Germany. The
transformation of the Soviet neander-
thaler into a “cultured,” jingoistic,
bemedalled, and utterly servile Spiess-
burger resembling his German 1890
equivalent is welcome on moral and
aesthetic grounds. Yet who was it that
cheered when the field-grey German
heroes marched into Belgium and
turned Europe into a graveyard? A
statist, servile, conformist bourgeoisie
strikes one as a rather uncertain guaran-
tee of a peaceful foreign policy.
On the central issue of the confer-
ence, whether Communism constitutes
a threat to Australia, Owen Harries
and Gregory Clark presented two
conflicting theses. Harries’ position rests
on the premise that Australia is a geo-
graphically isolated European enclave
in a civil-war belt threatened by Com-
munist China. America’s presence in
the area is vital to Australia’s survival.
Yet Harries argued convincingly that
the mere maintenance of our alliance
with the U.S.A. is not enough. Our
task is not only to tie the Americans
to ourselves but to
involve them more
deeply and more per-
manently in the
whole South - East
Asian area. For
otherwise a situation
could arise in which
Australia might become expendable
from an American point of view.
A corollary of Harries’ thesis is his
view that Australia should develop
foreign policy initiatives of her own,
rather than merely backing, more or
less automatically, what the Americans
are doing, and that these initiatives
should aim at making the American
presence in the area as irreversible as
possible. A foreign policy of this kind
will require a more extensive Austra-
lian military apparatus than the
present one. Harries disposed
effectively of the argument that a
direct military attack by China on
Australia is inconceivable in view of
China’s present low military capabilities.
He pointed out that military capabilities
can change rapidly these days, and
that we are directly vulnerable by way
of our Achilles’ heel New Guinea.
He also drew attention to the fact that
a direct Chinese military assault
against us may not be the only un-
desirable consequence of Chinese
hegemony in our vicinity. Such hege-
mony may also lead to the develop-
ment of a siege-quisling polarisation
of national life, splitting public opinion
into irreconcilable camps of appeasers
and suspected traitors on the one hand
and McCarthyite, militarist patriots on


By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
the other. It is of some interest to
note that Harries’ recommended policies
of goading the United States into ir-
reversible commitments on our side are
very closely modelled on those pursued
by Churchill toward the U.S.A. in
1940-41.
Gregory Clark’s paper was a col-
lection of myths and whinges which did
not really hang together to make up
a coherent thesis, yet they were clearly
recognisable as the cognitive part of
the general Left-neutralist syndrome,
the main components of which are
emotive and largely unconscious.
China tends not to intervene in Asian
civil wars. Only twice have they done
so (Laos and Vietnam). Chinese aims
are traditionalist, not induced by her
Marxist-Leninism. Her violent lan-
guage is not a guide to her conduct.
There is an equally long record of
pacific utterances. It would be inter-
esting to find evidence of “traditional”
pre-Communist Chinese concern and
involvement in Albania, Cuba, and
Ghana, to name only three areas of
extensive Red Chinese machinations.
It would be nice if one could ignore
the link between a constant stream
of menacing utterances, a state of
total mechanised paranoia at home,
and the operations of a complex sys-
tem of agents and revolutionary cadres
throughout the world. Logically, it
might be possible to do so. Yet it
would be in Donald Horne’s words
“a damn silly thing to do.” Toward
the end of the paper Clark broke out
into conspicuous praise of Lee Kwan
Yew, the model Asian statesman, whose
accession to power the West tried to
prevent.
What Clark conveniently ignored—
unlike Lee’s Minister of Defence
whose paper at the conference was inter
alia a total intellectual demolition of
Clark’s Weltanschauung is the fact
that without the British success in crush-
ing the Malayan insurgency there would
have been no Lee Kwan Yew. The
very people who are now loudest
against the war in Vietnam were
urging us not so long ago to hand over
Malaya, and her Lee Kwan Yews, to
Communist executioners. Clark’s paper
ended with a long and pointless attack
on the Security Service.
Since Dr. Goh Keng Swee is Minister
of Defence in the very government
which Mr. Clark had praised so
lavishly, it is perhaps of some interest
to note what he himself had to say
on employing security services. Dr. Goh
was quite explicit:
“The first and most important
prerequisite to success is, I regret
to say, an efficient secret police, or
‘Special Branch,’ to use the delicate
British colonial term for it. The object
is not so much to capture the secret
Communist underground, for, without
very severe totalitarian controls, this
cannot be easily achieved. The main
function of the secret police is the
penetration of all Communist open-
front mass organisations. Since the
membership and overt leadership of
these organisations are by their nature
open and not secret, penetration should
not present difficulty to technically
competent police personnel. The object
is to identify the principal leaders,
assess their characters and capability,
and find out the current intentions and
plans of these organisations. Without
such knowledge available to Govern-
ment, counter-measures against the
Communists may well prove counter-
productive. (With such knowledge, we
can, to quote Mao, ‘await the enemy’s
assault with ease and poise.’)”
D R \ GOH said the second function of
the secret police is to arrest and
detain key united front leaders at suit-
able times. When this occurs, it is impor-
tant to make it understood and accept-
able to the public. It is, of course,
regrettable that the due process of law
cannot be applied here. There are three
reasons for this. First, the evidence to
satisfy the requirements of legal proced-
ure will blow the cover of police agents
who have penetrated Communist open-
front organisations. Further, the possi-
bility of prosecution assumes that par-
ticipation in Communist conspiratorial
activities is a legal offence, which it
is not in most countries. Third, to wait
for the Communist activists to engage
in overtly illegal action, for example,
riots and other acts of violence before
prosecution, will give them a political
advantage which few governments of
the new States of Asia can afford. For
by then the political situation would
have deteriorated to a state of acute
instability, which in turn would prob-
ably have caused economic decline due
to loss of confidence. Should political
instability become endemic, serious
doubts will creep into men’s minds as
to who would emerge the winner. This
can make the problem of control of
subversion, for which public confidence
and co-operation are important, a very
acute one. The power of arrest and
detention without trial is, therefore, a
necessary weapon in the fight against
Communists in the newly established
Asian States.
Dr. Goh’s paper was a closely
reasoned analysis of Communist organi-
sational and operational techniques. It
was also the only conference paper
which contained new and fruitful
thoughts and facts. It began with a
forceful rebuttal of “Economism,” the
doctrine that Communism is a function
of “poverty.” It highlighted and
explained in a very sophisticated man-
ner the dominant role of Red China in
Communist operations in Singapore
and Malaya, and the key role of
schools and universities in the subver-
sive schemes. He also outlined a policy
of preventive counter-insurgency which
contains the following main features:
(a) gathering of information by a resi-
lient and intelligent secret service; (b)
selective and intelligent suppression of
key cadres based on (a); (c) active
counter-penetration of mass-organisa-
tions by politically conscious anti-
Communist activists; and (d) a pro-
gressive social policy.
Dr. Goh’s assessment of the failure
of the PKI to gain power in 1965 was
similar to my own: an adventurist act
by a party which had turned itself
from a Leninist combat instrument into
a mass-organisation and which had
become flabbily “social democratic” in
its organisational techniques. Dr. Goh’s
brief but masterly and concrete analy-
sis of the Malayan insurgency con-
trasted sharply with the vague pro-
fessorial talk about such pallid abstrac-
tions as “nationalism” and “colonial-
ism” which made up most of the debate
in a field where the only relevant kind
of knowledge must be acquired in
political praxis of the kind for which
Dr. Goh’s office offers many abundant
opportunities.
During the conference debate Mr.
Westerway created a mild stir by pro-
testing against the failure of the
organisers to invite a Communist
speaker. (One wonders why Mr. Wes-
terway did not invite a DLP speaker
in 1963 when he was organiser of the
Institute’s Canberra conference on
Political Forces in Australia.) The Left
was present in large numbers, giving
fulsome support to Mr. Max Teich-
man, a Senior Lecturer in Political
Science at Monash, who emerged in
debate as a sort of leader of the
Monash group. Mr. Teichman recently
stated on TV that Ky was smuggled
into Australia like “a packet of dope”
so as to condition the Australian pub-
lic to the custom of liquidating political
opponents! One wonders if this is the
“political science” the Victorian tax-
payer finances when he is unable by
law to make even voluntary contribu-
tions to Scientology. I only regret that
I cannot comment on Prof. Zelman
Cowan’s paper. It was unavailable at
the time of writing.


Face of the World
Asia: Confusion continued in news
reports from Red China, where Mao
Tse-tung had called on the People’s
Army to support him against the
“revisionists.” Soviet newsmen and
consular staffs were recalled, and
Russia had protested against Red
Guard anti-Soviet demonstrations.
Premier Sato’s Government was re-
turned in the Japanese elections.
Malaysia said she had abandoned
the Maphalindo concept. Indonesia’s
President Sukarno still rejected all
calls to resign, but attitudes of the
military junta, Congress, and the
students were hardening toward
force.
The Americas: The deaths of
five men in two Apollo capsules
shocked the nation and led NASA to
reappraise moon-project procedures
using oxygen-filled capsules. Presi-
dent Johnson ordered high-level in-
vestigations into bomb incidents in
four Yugoslav consulates in the U.S.
and two in Canada. Returned from
Saigon, General Maxwell Taylor
said, “There might be new develop-
ments ... for the better,” but Presi-
dent Johnson said rumors of peace
moves by Hanoi seemed unfounded.
President-elect Costa e Silva of
Brazil visited the U.S.A.
Europe: British trade unions de-
manded an end to the wage-freeze
as the nation’s unemployed reached
600,000. In Paris a one-day strike
against the French wages policy
stopped public transport. Britain’s
coming defence cut-back in Malta
led to a protest march of 6000
workers; Malta demanded duties on
aviation fuel and planes were
grounded. Madrid University was
closed after students rioted over in-
creased fees, and fought battles with
police. Soviet President Podgorny
was received at the Vatican, and
Rumania and West Germany ex-
changed Ambassadors.
Africa: In Ghana eight former
Ministers under Nkrumah were
charged with dissipating public
funds. In Cairo, Arab League leaders
debated the failure of their plan to
divert the Jordan River waters.
Congo’s President Mobutu failed to
sell shares for his nationalised
copper-mining syndicate in Belgium.
Portuguese forces claimed that 187
Mozambique guerillas had been
killed in January. Rhodesia expelled
a BBC camera team and threatened
the British Mission, described as “a
nest of spies.” In Rhodesia’s Parlia-
ment, the minority African United
Peoples’ Front said apartheid existed
in Rhodesia, disguised as “African
community development.”
OVERSEAS
Singapore without Opposition
From DAVID BONAVIA in Singapore.
Seldom has a democratically elected political party anywhere in the worlir
succeeded in controlling a State legislature as effectively as Mr Lee Kuan YeVf
People’s Action Party controls the Singapore Parliament. Seldom has a post-iil
colonial government achieved such striking administrative success in the socialp
field or done so much to play down racial and communal issues within its owii
nation. Seldom has a non-Communist Asian government established such a record]
of financial integrity as by general consent the PAP administration has done)
There is today no effective, organ-
ised political opposition in Singapore.
How long can this politician’s dream
survive? What , issues will a future
opposition crystallise around? And how
sincere is the PAP in its professed
desire for a tough, constructive parlia-
mentary group to keep it on its toes?
There is in Singapore a freedom
and high intellectual level of debate
most refreshing after the moody
apathy of Hong Kong or the brittle
consensus in Taiwan. Private political
discussion is lively and well informed.
Politics is not a dirty word. And yet
there is a widespread suspicion of the
PAP and its possible plans for per-
petuation of the present one-party set-
up. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew has disturbed
many intellectuals by his recent on-
slaughts on the English-educated
teachers and students of Singapore Uni-
versity. Many people who otherwise
admire him resent his increasing use
of the first person pronoun and the
first person possessive. The Foreign
Minister, Mr. Rajaratnam, perpetrated
a famously bad piece of political public
relations when he stated that the Gov-
ernment “has induced the opposition
to liquidate themselves out of the
Chamber” (December 15, 1965). Dr.
Goh Keng Swee, the Minister for In-
terior and Defence, abandoned the
language of law and constitutional pro-
cedures when he warned Left-wing
troublemakers that they would be
“clobbered properly” if they were not
careful. The unspecified number of
L,eft-wing politicians detained indefi-
nitely in Changi Jail command rather
little sympathy in Singapore, even
among those who are suspicious of Mr.
Lee and the PAP; but the existence of
such detention powers 1 in the absence
of any clear-cut emergency is no
encouragement to an opposition to
come forward. And the Government’s
latest opposition to the proposals of
the Constitutional Commission, which
they themselves set up, is an ominous
cloud over the future of political free-
dom in Singapore.
I have heard the view expressed by
a responsible and intelligent Singapore
citizen that “there was a more liberal
atmosphere in the last days of the
colonial regime than there is now.” The
Singapore Special Branch is widely
recognised as a political instrument
of formidable strength. It is said thatt
anyone who openly organises opposi-J
tion to the PAP immediately has a 9
dossier; that he is shadowed and his, a
friends are questioned; that he has rea-jt
son to fear discrimination if he applies!)
for Government-controlled posts, fori
instance in teaching; that he may bee
denied a passport; even that his busi-|
ness or professional practice may be
discriminated or competed against by)
Government agencies.
It is impossible for a visitor to assessl
the accuracy of these allegations. Buf
they are made freely by people who)
in almost the same breath will praise
Lee Kuan Yew as a brilliant national)
leader. They are prepared to concede
that he was not going too far in con-
trolling the disruptive activities of pro-
Communist elements. They admire his)
housing schemes and the far-sighted
concept of the Jurong industrial zone
(alas sabotaged by the separation from l
Malaysia). They admit that the PAP
has an excellent record in controlling!
graft. There is little sympathy to bfl
found for the Kuala Lumpur Govern-
ment.
gTRONG though his position is, Lee|
has to hold together a highly hetero*
geneous political faction which might,
without him, split up on racial orj (
communal lines. An English-educated,
Chinese who can make political)
speeches in three languages, Lee is a,
match for anyone in debate. But, of;
late, observers have noted a tendency||
for him to stray from the point in dis-j
cussions and to indulge in admittedly,
stimulating monologues about his in-
tuitions and plans. No one is forceful)
enough to “put him on a spot” and)
force him to justify specific policies ini
detail. Is any human being strong,
enough, in circumstances, to resist)
in the long run the temptation to over
ride weakly voiced criticism? The
public discussion of the constitutional 1
proposals which really are vitall)')
important was a symptom of this;
all-too-easy acceptance of Government
policies. The only person who spoke
up decisively and analytically was the)
former Chief Minister, Mr. David
Marshall, now retired from politics ana
practising law in Singapore city.
Despite his charisma, Lee has to
walk a difficult tightrope between the

s ections of the Chinese community,
makes up 75 percent of Singa-
pore’s population. Some quarters see in
'this the reason for his virulent attacks
pn Singapore University by appear-
ing to despise the English-educated
Chinese (of whom he is one!) he gains
sympathy among the Chinese-educated
whose support he needs).
The attacks on English-educated
unless explained in this
are the more surprising in
[.(that Lee has reportedly already suc-
ceeded in bringing many influential
£niversity figures into his “establish-
ent.” The opulent Pyramid Club
.variously reported to have been master-
minded by Lee himself, and by Goh
[jieng Swee includes some high
‘■University people as members. Even
a some who are suspicious of the PAP
%e keen to join the Pyramid Club, be
it to keep themselves on the right side
sif the “establishment,” or be it for
ignore idealistic reasons to see what
e[an be done about keeping the PAP
Lee Kuan Yew
from the inside. But with Lee’s
'[alleged) present tendency to turn in-
creasingly in on himself and his own
(counsels, it seems that the Pyramid
*Club will not succeed in functioning as
[[a “brains trust” to his administration.
.Though still highly exclusive, according
to reports of those who have had ex-
perience of it, it is becoming more and
more of a social affair. At Singapore
(University (as in Hong Kong) students
)lear job discrimination if they get their
jnoses too dirty in politics. But to allow
[this fear to exist among young intel-
lectuals, and even to encourage it by
showing students their Special Branch
fries, flies in the face of a professed
desire to see the growth of a responsible
opposition. Youthful opposition must be
allowed a degree of irresponsibility.
! If there is at present no likelihood
(of a political opposition forming in
jthe PAP itself, where will it come from,
Vhen it does come? The Barisan
Sosialis, in recent times the only serious
challenger to the PAP, is now dis-
credited as a constructive opposition.
Many of its leaders (former PAP men)
are in jail. Hardly anyone takes
seriously its rabid, pro-Peking line. The
Left-wing student movement centred
round Nanyang University and some
Chinese middle schools has split into
“revisionist” and “Red Guard” factions,
each slanging the other in Peking-style
invective which seems grotesquely irre-
levant to bourgeois Singapore.
There is a further barrier to opposi-
tion: the PAP’s administrative perform-
ance has been so good in many fields
that it is difficult for opponents to pick
holes in it and suggest viable alter-
natives. With a high per capita national
income (thought to be inferior in Asia
only to Japan’s and Hong Kong’s), and
with a still flourishing trading economy,
the risks involved in political opposi-
tion outweigh the rewards. Individual
Singaporeans have much to lose, and
perhaps little to gain, by opposing the
PAP at present.
Economics are the father to politics,
and if an opposition is to organise itself
in Singapore, it will almost certainly
be for economic reasons. There is
widespread disquiet in the business
community about the future of this
traditional entrepot if largely cut off
from its Malaysian hinterland (it is
optimistic to imagine that ruined Indo-
nesia will be able to rehabilitate its
primary production soon enough to
compensate for the gradual loss of
Malaysian trade). Singapore has a
growing army of unemployed. If the
economic situation deteriorates over the
next few years—and there seems to be
little evidence that it will not —hard-
ship in the working classes will surely
throw up trade-union leaders who have
nothing to lose by risking a confronta-
tion with the Special Branch. Already
the PAP has political difficulties in
reconciling the demands of Govern-
ment with the demands of the trade-
union organisation (NTUC), which the
Party itself set up. It is most un-
realistic to demand that trade-unionism
separate itself from politics. The busi-
ness community, too, is only sitting
tight just now and hoping that “Harry
will pull us through” (compare
Rhodesia and lan Smith). If Singa-
pore’s industrialisation policy fails,,
there may be a growing recognition of
the s need for an accommodation with
Kuala Lumpur. And Lee’s personal
relations with the Kuala Lumpur
leaders are one of the chief obstacles.
If Singapore sees itself as a Chinese
island in a Malay sea, it is natural that
its thoughts should turn to defence
matters. Even disregarding the ques-
tion of water supplies, its present mili-
tary forces are not considered adequate
for any serious defence of the island.
To guard against subversion, present a
tough exterior to any potential invader,
and activate a nationalist spirit at
home, Mr. Lee may well decide to draw
lessons from Israel —also a racial island
—and turn his thoughts to some form
of universal national service, with every
citizen a soldier.

Instant Art
“IT’S LIKE an LSD experience,
really,” Marty Rubin said cutting some
white cardboard to size, placing it on
a spinning disc, and handing some paint
to a customer. “Colored paint splat-
ters in blobs or concentric circles while
the disc spins. Figures jump out of the
disc as it rotates, you can pull your
focus in and out, and with concentra-
tion you can actually enter the sphere.
For a chance for someone who doesn’t
paint to create, 20 cents is a ridicu-
lous price.”
Rubin, a Los Angeles psychologist,
and his wife, Kathy, who teaches Latin-
Twenty cents worth of In Action Art
American literature, installed their
stand at Kings Cross, Sydney, last
week. Originally they called the stand
Hi Camp (that is, Intended as opposed
to Low, or Unintended, Camp), be-
cause they weren’t to know that
“camp” in Australia still meant what
it had meant when they were teen-
agers in America seven or eight years
ago. So they settled on In Action Art,
and on their first night in business sold
20 6in. x Bin. red-and-yellow explo-
sions to a woman for her bathroom
wall.
The Rubins left America because,
Rubin said, he grew tired of being
arrested for taking part in protest
demonstrations when it should have
been his cousin, of the same name.
They came to Australia in search of a
psychologist’s Utopia, peopled with the
enormously aware, self-styled individu-
alists they had found all Australians
to be while they were touring Europe,
living in Spain, and hitch-hicking
through South America.
But they have in the past few days
returned to America because of a family
crisis, not through disillusionment.
And certainly not because a paint
company had achieved similar results
to their In Action Art with a washing-
machine at the Trade Fair in Sydney.
“We’ll be back as soon as we have
another $1000,” Rubin said at his
last night at the stand in the Cross.
A sculptor bought the Rubins out.
He is wheeling a better deal. He
still has the same range of enamel
paints in easy-squeeze tomato-sauce
bottles in red, black, white, yellow,
green, light and dark blue and charges
20c for the 3” x 7” in two colors and
80c for the 6” x 8” with as many
squeezes and colors as you like. But
the new owner will add iridescent paints
to his range and will work under a

Sydney's Bright Birds
JEAN PLAIDY’S visit to Sydney came
as part of a world cruise, the reward
of years of best-sellers under her own
name and that of Victoria Holt: in
the tradition of Margaret Irwin, she
has written, as Jean Plaidy, novels
with historical figures as the central
characters Henry VIII, Anne
Boleyn, Mary Queen of Scots and
in the Bronte-Du Maurier tradition as
Victoria Holt has revived the “Gothic”
tradition with spectacular success: her
“Mistress of Mellyn” was on the best-
seller lists for months, and has been
bought by Paramount as a possible
starring vehicle for Samantha Eggar.
“I began writing romantic novels as
Eleanor Burford,” Miss Plaidy
a charming, middle-aged woman
told us in the rather improbable set-
ting of the Oronsay’s A-deck aft, look-
ing across flat, ice-blue water at the
smashed artichoke of the Opera House.
“Nine at first, without being accepted.
Finally I sold one under the name of
Eleanor Burford to Herbert Jenkins.
Oddly enough, with a Sydney setting
although I’d never been here
‘Beyond the Blue Mountains.’ Period,
1790-1830, about a girl falsely accused
of something, I’ve forgotten what,
theft perhaps, and sent out as a con-
vict. I’ve been looking for the bril-
liantly colored birds I described flying
round Sydney Harbor, but I haven’t
yet found a single one.
“Among my other successes were
‘Murder Most Royal,’ about Henry
VIII and Anne Boleyn I read lots
of letters, records, and things and,
luckily, writing a historical novel to-
day, unlike in the Victorian age, one
doesn’t have to use a cloak of hypoc-
risy to please the public.
“Then there was ‘The Sixth Wife’'
about Catherine Parr. And ‘St.
Thomas’s Eve,’ about the Tudor period
again. As Victoria Holt I had a very
big success, as you know, with ‘Mistress
of Mellyn’. An American agent,
Patricia Scharter, with Mclntosh and
Otis, came to London and said to me,
‘You know, you’re a potential best-
seller.’ Not being noted for my modesty,
I agreed. We decided to put one to-
gether. There had to be a really good
story. Set in the past, and for women,
so the central character had to be a
woman. She had to be menaced. A.
series of tight spots. But she must
have her wits about her, she must get
out of trouble through her own-
endeavors.
“So we settled on a plot. Yes, if di£
rather resemble ‘Jane Eyre.’ She was
a governess, Victorian setting, a well-
educated girl, of course, so that when
she finally came to be mistress of the
household one would feel that she
could use the correct knife and fork.
The man was in a way like Rochester,,
though not really. There was a wife
who had mysteriously disappeared . . .
finally, excitement, the heroine is irr
prisoned in a priest’s hole, I think it
was, the villainess is in the next house
. . . and is responsible for trapping
her. Her motive? Do you know, I’ve
quite forgotten. It’s so long since I
wrote the book. Was it jealousy? I
don’t think she was jealous. No, I just
don’t remember.
“Anyway, the book appeared, and it
has made a great deal of money. My
next book, ‘Kirkland Revels,’ also had
a menaced heroine. I write five
a day, and I’m really caught up I
sit there weeping and weeping.
I’m writing a first-person ‘autobiog-
raphy’ of Marie Antoinette at the sug-
gestion of my wonderful editor at
Doubleday. She’s been much maligned
she really cared for the people..
How did I think my way into her
brain? Well, I have, and now mg
flat looks rather like the Petit Trianon.
I’ve bought a lot of tapestries, you see-
— a Fragonard. A Boucher. A lot of
mirrors.” As she looked out across the
setting of her first book Jean Plaidy"
smiled.

SYDNEY is likely to see a profes-
sional production of the Peter Weiss
play “The Persecution and Assassi-
nation of Marat as Performed by the
Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton
under the Direction of the Marquis
de Sade” this year. Peter Brook, who
first presented “Marat—Sade” in Lon-
don, has now moved on from the
Theatre of Cruelty to Documentary
Theatre with the nine-author piece on
Vietnam, “Us.” But as long as London
is committed to modishness and Aus-
tralia to continual presentation of
overseas successes, we shall always be
at least one step behind.
“Marat—Sade” has just, in fact,
been presented in France and the reac-
tion was, to say the least, unexpected.
The descendants of the Marquis de
Sade went to court and got a ruling
that references to their noted ancestor
be cut out of the play. The play is
now “Marat—X,” and is about a per-
formance at the Charenton Asylum
directed by a M. de X.
And one of Marat’s descendants is
complaining that the actor playing this
part is far too good-looking to repre-
sent his ancestor.
Before the Mast
IN THE WAKE of Sir Francis
Chichester’s departure for England via
the Horn, we discovered that one of
our artists, Mr. H. Lloyd-Jones, when
he was younger and, he admits, con-
siderably more foolish, made the trip
in a German wheat-carrying ship.
This was the Lisbeth, a steel-hulled,
four-masted barque of 3000 tons. When
Mr. Lloyd-Jones signed on he had
only once been outside Sydney Heads.
The trip to the Horn, with no land-
fall en route, took 42 days, and it
was, in all, 120 days to Eire.
Mr. Lloyd-Jones explained that in
1927, when he made his trip, the days
of sail were clearly numbered. It was
becoming less and less profitable to
compete with steam, and to cut
expenses crews grew smaller and
smaller. “The old clipper ships were
much smaller than the Lisbeth, but
most of them had large crews,” he
said. “We had a crew of 24 and it
was four hours on, four hours off, the
whole voyage. We rarely got enough
sleep. The captain and the first mate
continually argued about the set of
the sails, and often when the watch
changed we had to go 170 ft. aloft to
stow sails, which were sometimes frozen
hard.
“But there were only two members
of the crew aged more than 24. These
were the cook and the sailmaker, and
they never went aloft.”
When they rounded the Horn the
ship came in close enough for Mr.
Lloyd-Jones to get what he felt was
a reasonably accurate drawing of it.
But a wind-gust carried the drawing
away and he had to postpone his career
as an artist until he was thankfully
back on dry land.

MAKING AUSTRALIAN TV COMMERCIALS
TINIEST FILMS
IN THE WORLD
BY CHARLES HICHAM
THE door of the office, a coolly
shaded room in North Sydney, is
marked with the slightly ominous,
Orwellian words “Perception Labora-
tory.” Inside, on a table, stands a black
box, rather like an old-fashioned peep-
show. Projected into this box, for the
benefit of the visitor, commercials can
be shown. And while you watch, un-
beknown to you, a camera records by
infra-red technique the pupil of your
eye, the pupil enlarging or contracting
to give what they at least claim to
be an infallible guide to your subcon-
scious responses as images of cigarettes
or drinks or detergents flash brilliantly
across the screen. This “X-ray of the
mind” is only one of many slightly
sinister 1984-ish gimmicks that advertis-
ing has developed in an attempt to
probe us in depth, to show the experts
(or the hucksters?) ways of adapting
the presentation of TV commercials to
ensure our total involvement.
The eye camera box is a device
typical of the futuristic quality of
modern TV commercial making: this
is an area into which the expert has
moved with a high-pressure pushiness
unfamiliar in Australia. In two months
of visiting advertising offices and
studios, of talking to creative directors
and backroom boys who test the audi-
ence’s psychic responses, the impression
I have had is one of a solemn serious-
ness, of a carefully calculated planning
and executing which tends to resemble
building a skyscraper with match-
sticks. Although one or two advertising
offices are surprisingly without air-
conditioning, most exude an air as
luxuriously clinical as an expensive
hospital’s. Corridors stretch antisepti-
cally between shining frosted windows,
carpets swallow your feet in cool green
or blue, and some executives boast set-
tings with louvred, gloss suavity of a
Lux commercial living-room.
Television commercials are not
contrary to the view of many usually
made up by energetic morons. On the
contrary, amid the shining offices and
suave clothes, the soft voices and
padded footsteps high in the clouds,
there is some cool cleverness at work.
(Miscalculations do take place: one
example is said to have been the cam-
paign for Maggi Soups, with actress
June Thody cooing in rapture as she
prepared the brew in all kinds of
improbable locations this is said to
have appealed more to men, who of
course, don’t usually make soup.) The
money is big some creative directors
go up into the $20,000 a year bracket
and beyond the competition said to
be of a Madison Avenue-like intensity,
the hours long (some executives work
18 hours a day, and shooting schedules
are murderous).
PROBLEMS are endless: the client,
the producer of the manufactured
article from cornflakes to fly-sprays,
from floor wax to wimpies, often has
specific ideas (sometimes ill-advised) on
how his product is to be handled, and
may lay down rules that are technically
tricky or irritating to follow. In one
recent case, a sponsor was said to have
wanted a “burp” added to the delivery
of a brushless shaving-cream from the
can. Teams of writers engaged by the
agency may have to sweat it out for
nights before they can devise their tiny,
banal, 30-or 60-second dramatic presen-
tation on air; novel gimmicks, unusual
methods of getting across specific quali-
ties of a product, all have to be weighed
and considered for what often seems, to
the outsider, feeble and trivial results.
Artists are often engaged to help plan
images, and artists and writers may not
concur on their presentation. Producers
within the agency (a loose term, which
seldom means a producer in the film
sense, but rather a liaison man who en-
sures that the company’s and client’s
wishes are carried out) have to work
with directors in a studio, and here
trouble often brews.
Clashes can take place between the
experienced commercial director on the
studio sound stage and the “producer,”
who often is too young or insufficiently
knowledgeable about film-making tech-
niques. It’s all a long, hard road before
the final, still more taxing experience of
showing the commercial to the often
dissatisfied sponsor a stage at which
changes may be called for and tempers
may become frayed. For the jaded
ad-man, it must often seem like a monu-
mental labor to produce nothing more
substantial than a soap-bubble.
Some agencies have attempted to re-
duce their problems by ensuring that
their own producers are experienced
film-makers, and are either called pro-
ducer-directors or, simply, directors. In
many cases, these men do not engage
outside help but work directly in the
studios without more than token tech-
nical assistance. Hans von Adlerstein,
of J. Walter Thompson, is a case in
point: he worked in film-making, he
told me, in Europe, and had directed
there in recent years some of the lush
Australian Lux commercials, in which
a celebrated star moves silkily round a
luxury room, talking softly and per-
suasively about the soap’s values: its
kindness to the skin, its ability to cleanse
“deep down,” and so on. The selling
point, Mr. von Adlerstein said, could
be reduced to a nutshell: “If it’s good
enough for a star, it’s good enough for
you.” For a German-based advertise-
ment starring the film star Marianne
Koch, Mr. von Adlerstein flew to Ger-
many: “For the sets we used a very
celebrated art director, and the lead-
ing German cameraman Gunter
Anders did the photography. We also
used a top dress designer.” Marion
Loker, author of the Lux scripts, told
me: “We like to use a woman-to-
woman approach. We can get 120 to
130 words into the one minute a Lux
commercial lasts. In that one minute
we have to squeeze in the main selling
points that Lux gives a softer,
smoother skin, and that the soap has a
distinctive, beautiful shape as well as a
beautiful texture.”
In direct contrast with the luxury of
Lux commercials their atmosphere
of rich, spotless, and vacuous living
are the relentlessly down-to-earth,
housewifely appeals of the many deter-
gent ads. J. Walter Thompson may
use a high-toned style for Lux, but in
this more humdrum area they use
plainer (though no less adroit) methods..
Mr. von Adlerstein said: “For in-
stance, there was our campaign for the
OMO television commercial. Seventy


or eighty housewives might be inter-
viewed in supermarkets, streets, and
near their houses and from these we
choose a handful who look and sound
good on camera. This handful is then
audition-filmed in our own internal
workshop studio. Finally one is selected.
We take her back and film her in her
natural environment. She is encouraged
to give her (true) reasons for liking
the product. These may be very lengthy.
We reduce what she says, put it into
conciser form, script it, and she learns
the script and speaks it. We don’t, of
course, adapt her words or in any way
make her say what she wouldn’t say
normally.” Other agencies Hansen
Rubensohn, McCann-Erickson, for in-
stance cut similar interviews shot on
the street to a more manageable length,
preserving the continuity of the en-
dorsement as it is spoken.
HARRIS, of Lintas, said that
one important thing to remember
in detergent commercials was not using
a scene or dialogue that the house-
wife couldn’t identify. “We believe
women are terribly pragmatic
about things like this,” he confided,
“and don’t want anything too far
out. Although on one occasion we did
try something a bit different by wash-
ing a rose in a washing-machine and
bringing it out with the petals un-
harmed . . . The most important thing
is to ensure that the housewife sees
herself up there on the screen,
approving a product.” For this reason,
several advertising men told me, it
is essential that the housewife used in
these commercials must have a warm,
sympathetic, average personality, not
too “different” or clever; if she uses
it, we must use it, too, the housewives
will think.
Selling goods to children is another
complex matter. Here, Bruce Harris
said, the emphasis is on conveying a
sense of enjoyment: if you have to
show a housewife the ingredients of a
soup or the effectiveness of a soap,
you have to give kids the feeling that
a breakfast cereal or junior T-shirt or
an ice-cream has a “fun” image.
“Once again, identification is the most
important thing of all. Kids see them-
selves on the screen; in one commercial
for Streets Ice Cream we began with
Ray Brown and the Whispers, and
with one for a new brand called Rasp-
berry Chip we had a most attractive
girl in a way-out swimming costume
crossing the beach carrying an ice-
cream; she drops it on to the chest
of a boy, asleep. He and his group
sit up and gobble the delectable con-
fection the ice-cream, not the girl.”
Similar thinking inspired the famous
commercial for Minties, made by
Supreme Sound studios; a scene on
a beach, kids running around, surf
glittering in the sun, a daring shot of
shadowy dancing figures reflected in
sunglasses, and a chorus chanting, “It’s
moments like these . . . etc.” Boys
and girls see themselves having a ball
as they watch the commercial they
feel that Minties can help them have it.
Products like foundation garments
and stockings can present some tricky
problems. Neville Merchant, of Jackson
Wain, said: “We might have to have
such a commercial directed by a woman,
as a model would feel ill at ease, if
directed by a man, in such clothing.”
Cigarettes call for a “sophisticated”
treatment. They usually are shown be-
ing smoked by healthy young people
dashing out of the surf, taking a
deep, almost sexual puff, and relaxing
happily while the smoke’s ingredients
seep into their lungs. Or dining out in
luxury, stepping into handsome yachts,
spanking along roads to stop for a
smoke (in a luxury vehicle, of course).
The atmosphere is obviously sensual
smoking associated with health, wealth,
and success with the prettiest girls
and men and women chosen to play in
these commercials are usually outstand-
ingly handsome and fit.
For Peter Stuyvesant, Jackson Wain
send teams to shoot their models in all
kinds of “exciting” locations Paris,
London, New York. Rapid cutting
knowingly produces a feeling of speed
of pulse-racing thrills. “Whether it’s
‘Gone With The Wind,’ ‘The Bible,’ or
a commercial, if it’s not well cut it’s
crook,” Neville Merchant, of Jackson
Wain, said succinctly.
Wasn’t the image of escapism pre-
sented by cigarette commercials some-
times a bit overstressed, suggesting a
glamorous life far beyond the average
man’s pocket? Didn’t the commercials
lose “identification” this way? Mr. Mer-
chant said: “They aren’t always escap-
ist. After all, one Peter Stuyvesant
commercial showed the Viking Festival
-- and that’s open to peasant or prince.
But yes, I do agree we try to project
an image of desirability. And what’s
wrong with that? There’s nothing wrong
with Mustangs and speedboats, is there?
After all, bus drivers have yachts in
Sydney Harbor, don’t they? And then
everybody likes to feel he can live a
little like James Bond.” But finding
glamorous people to act in these com-
mercials was something difficult. “Say I
want ten nice-looking blondes. And five
brunettes. It’s tough. Some model
agencies send out the same old hags
year after year. So we’ve stationed
people at the head of Wynyard ramp.
They stop good-looking girls and blokes
on their way to work and offer them
jobs.”
J>RUCE JARRETT, of George Pat-
terson’s, pointed out that cigarettes
were status-symbols. “There is, you
must remember, more status in smoking
a cigarette than in using detergent. The
detergent commercials are a slice of life.
But cigarette commercials suggest a
very high standard of living.”
For some products not immediately
attractive, a breezy technique using
animation has been found useful. For
instance, the famous Louie the Fly Mor-
tein commercial devised by Hansen
Rubensohn. The agency’s Bryce Court-
enay talked about the campaign (featur-
ing a cartoon fly which is finally slain
by the spray) with warm affection: “I
love Louie. Flies in most schools now
are known as Louies a triumph for
this particular commercial and proof of
an overwhelming success for the pro-
duct, Louie gets fan-mail from the
children. We see him killed each time,
but he comes back like Mickey Mouse;


when they see the commercial, they
don’t think of him as dead.”
The agency also used animation for
its Trix commercials. Gay and bright,
too, are its famous Coca-Cola commer-
cials, set on beach or in discotheque or
wild party, creating, like ice-cream or
cigarette commercials, an atmosphere of
fast and furious living and laced with
some startlingly overt sexual symbolism
bottles pressing into mouths and so
on. “The intention is to create a teen-
age revelry feeling with as many as
101 cuts in the one minute of showing.
Coke has an air of excitement, it re-
freshes and stimulates, and we try to
bring this out on film.”
When planning of commercials is
finished, with everything cunningly
geared to pleasing the audience, it re-
mains to be seen whether the audience
really will react as obediently as it is
supposed to. For this reason, a number
of agencies have developed techniques
for “trying them out on the dog.”
Hansen Rubensohn’s parent company
in the United States started the most
Orwellian of all forms of market re-
search into the commercial’s effect on
an audience: the eye camera. Mar-
plan, the American company co-owned
with Hansen Rubensohn, has an office
in Sydney run by an Englishman of
scientific Fred Hoyle-ish mien, Mike
Larbalestier. “We call the eye camera,
irreverently, ‘pupil-pop,’ ” Larbalestier
said with a smile. “After the war we
found that people didn’t often tell you
what they really thought in market re-
search surveys. We had to get over this
to probe into their subconscious to their
real responses. Eckardt Hess, an animal
psychologist with the University of
Chicago, supplied an answer.
“H E had been administering stimuli
to animals. For instance, he’d show
food to a cat and notice how the pupil
of the eye expanded at the sight.
Animals were living beings which could
not articulate, but this way you could
see their responses, and many human
beings were living beings who could
not articulate, either.
“Of course, techniques had been
used in which people had been tested
by devices in which skin reactions to
stimuli were shown. But people didn’t
like being strapped up in chairs and
given electrical impulses. And you can’t
blame them. So Hess tried other devices.
“He got a number of pictures of
landscapes, and one of a Hugh Hefner
Playgirl. He held the pictures over his
head, like this, see, and shuffled them
for his assistant, Jim Polt, so! When
Polt saw the Playgirl his pupils went
Zonk!” After this, Larbalestier told me,
Hess devised the original of Marplan’s
famous black box. “We input the
stimuli into the box commercials,
or separate images of frypans, electric
toasters, etc. We bounce the images
off a series of mirrors, photographing
the watcher’s eye reflection with an
infra-red technique which shows the
smallest variations in the pupil of the
eye.
“Of course, most people don’t know
they are being photographed while
they’re watching. It’s about the nearest
we can get to photographing the sub-
conscious mind.” In the boardroom,
shuttered against the sun, Larbalestier
showed me a series of films. A cat’s
eyes, its pupils enlarged after seeing a
dish of food. Then a baby. “The
female pupillometric graph shot up
when we showed the baby. But when
we added a delectable-looking woman,
the male shot up. Here is a nude
female. The female pupil graph stayed
put, the male shot up. A male nude—
female interest shot up.” Obvious, one
would have thought, without the eye
camera to tell us, but
Cuts could be made or additional
footage shot according to those sections
of a commercial where pupils con-
tracted or expanded. Round watches
might cause pupils to expand milli-
metres more than square watches of the
same make. White covers for an
encyclopedia might cause pupils to
expand more than red, or vice versa.
And so on: “We can bypass all vocal
communication and get close to the
things you don’t know you feel,” said
Mr. Larbalestier triumphantly. And in
a handout he gave me, pupillometrics
was shown to “figure out what approxi-
mately was going on in the mind of a
cat, prove that a woman who declared
she loved modern art actually loathed
it, examine the secret thoughts of two
virile-appearing young men and deter-
mine which one was an admitted homo-
sexual, find meaning in the thoughts
of a four-year-old boy. Pupillometrics,”
declared the handout further, “is the
X-ray of the mind . . . the pupil is
a direct extension of the brain and
cannot be consciously controlled.” Fair
warning.
Another organisation, ASI, run by
Columbia Pictures, uses computer
behind a projector beaming films on to
the screen at the Anzac Auditorium in
Sydney. Many seats in the theatre
are equipped with hand dials, marked
“very dull, dull, normal, good, very
good,” and so on. The audience sees
a commercial screened, then turns the
knob to the appropriate point, and the
results, fed into the computer, are sorted
out instantly until a cross-section of the
reaction can be gauged. Audiences are
brought in by the hundred at night
including audiences of children and
a moderator relaxes the crowd, so that
“no tension will mar their responses.”
Audiences are found by housewifely or
motherly women engaged by ASI to
go from door to door or thread their
way through supermarkets looking for
suitable subjects or “respondents.”
Trained psychologists are in charge
of each session. A new ASI device
scheduled to come here soon is a “Basal
Skin Multiple Resistance Recorder.”
This is based on the fact that sub-
conscious emotional responses to a com-
mercial emerge in skin resistance: two
finger electrodes are attached to a
“wrist-watch” containing miniature
electrons. Each set is connected to a
central recorder which records the
composite responses of a group. For
very young children, the ASI people
showed me a series of pieces of paper
with printed faces drawn on them.
These faces varied from despondent to
excited: all a child had to do was tick
the appropriate face to show his ot-
her degree of interest in a screened
commercial.
Another organisation, known as AAA.
has dummy sets at a Chatswood test-
room into which commercials are pro-
jected by a special device. Trained
psychologists use indirection methods to
determine audience responses to a com-
mercial They take viewers back inch
by inch over a screening to determine
their unconscious reactions to stimuli
within the images. MFI of North
Sydney similarly use indirect question-
ing, although they prefer to project
commercials on a screen, and splice
these into a film.
QNCE these often incredibly complex
devices have done their work, the
techniques of executing the commercials
worked out, the scripts finished, tenders
are taken at the various studios to see
which can produce a commercial best
and most economically (some agencies,
notably Lintas, use studios on the basis
of past performance regardless of cut-
costing). Of the freelance directors,
the best known are Jack Lee, British
director of such famous films as “A
Town Like Alice” and “Robbery Under
Arms,” and Donald Wynne, another
talented British director of commercials,
who made the first ever shown on
British television (for Gibbs’ SR
toothpaste in 1953). Wynne has made
commercials in Mexico, Hollywood, and
Portugal.
Studios like Brian Chirlian’s Ajax
Films, a British Tobacco subsidiary,
Don Daggett’s Fontana Films, Artransa,
and Merv Murphy’s Supreme Sound
all have heavy schedules and have pre-
ferred increasingly to give quality
results rather than cutting costs to the
bone.
From the planning of a commercial
- the client laying down the broad
lines along which he wants a product
sold, the difficult work of the unsung
armies of the copywriter, to the wrang-
lings of the media chiefs, the sketches
of the artists, the testings of alternative
workshop-made commercials on the
audience via eye camera pupillometrics,
hand dials, dummy sets or special
screenings, to the final shooting, cutting
and sponsor screening this is often
an operation running up to six weeks
or more. An exhausting process, costing
thousands of dollars, and at the end the
showing on television: huge machin-
ery bringing about the tiniest films in
the world. Cigarette or Coke boys and
girls go-go or splash out of the surf,
housewives talk away about their wash-
ing, a family quaffs oats or flakes, stars
drift around imitation living-rooms
talking about the shape and texture of
Lux. And outside the box looking in,
his pupils obediently contracting or
expanding, the purpose and supine
target of it all: you.


AROUND MELBOURNE
A Rare and Beautiful Occasion
COLIN PREECE is a gentle,
kindly character. For many
years he was manager of Sep-
pelts at Great Western, and he pro-
duced brut champagne and reds of
such quality that sometimes he was
an embarrassment to his firm. As
Dr. Sam Benwell pointed out in
his book “Journey to Wine in Vic-
toria,” people would insist on talk-
ing about “Colin Preece’s wine.”
And dammit, there even seemed a
possibility that he owned Great
Western. Recently his health broke
down, he is no longer manager of
Great Western, but he carries on
as a sort of adviser and public rela-
tions man for Seppelts.
Colin Preece’s other claim to
fame was that he was permanent
president of the Great Western Rac-
ing Club. Now there is only one
meeting a year at Great Western
and it takes place on Queen’s
Birthday weekend. It doesn’t make
the metropolitan dailies and you
don’t see it on the TAB lists, but
it is a rare and beautiful occasion.
This year was its 90th birthday,
but actually it was going down fast
when Colin Preece took it in hand
in 1933.
Great Western is an old mining
town halfway between Stawell and
Ararat and it was called Great
Western because this was the west-
ern extremity of the diggings. How
big? Well, one burp and you are
through. It is now home for the
Seppelts and Best’s vineyards. As
we were saying, in 1933, Colin
Preece thought, “Wouldn’t it be nice
if there were champagne at the
races,” so he installed a champagne
bar.
I don’t think the club received
the best of the champagne, mosth
they were rejects because of some
discoloration, but the bar price was
sixpence a glass. From then on the
club has moved into a gallop. The
Great Western meeting is a great
Western District social occasion,
and somehow the horses don’t seem
terribly important.
Now Colin Preece is no longer
president, he’s just a committee
member, and the president is the
local postmaster, Ab Illig. The
champagne has progressed to 25
cents a glass, but when you con-
sider there are eight glasses to a
bottle, and it costs 50 cents a glass
at Flemington, it is still the cheap-
est champagne in the country.
Last week the sun was shining
out of a beautiful police-car-blue
sky. Frankly, the track was pretty
rough, but the scene was gorgeous.
The horses came galloping straight
through the gum trees, and on the
back straight they went past the
rows of white pinot vines. This year
the champagne bar graduated to
the “champagne garden,” and there
were two ladies in white jackets
with black bow ties to give the show
some prestige. All afternoon there
was a non-stop symphony of popping
corks: occasionally spiced by a
superb, wheeze from an 18 being
broached at the Beer Bar next door.
There were six races on the pro-
gram, with all sorts of cash prizes,
plus boxes of towels, trays of drink-
ing glasses and such, but more
importantly there were two bottles
of champagne for each race, and
for the last race, the Champagne
Stakes, there was a whole case of
Great Western.
After long experience at country
race meetings, your correspondent
can announce that this is the most
eminently practical prize given in
Victoria.
Oh, yes, the Great Western meet-
ing has also advanced in another
manner. It now has a Fashions in
the Field contest. They didn’t man-
age to call in Jean Shrimpton or
the Baroness Thyssen, but one
judge was Margaret Wood, the
model who has become the pin-up
girl for the boys in Vietnam. The
fashions were interesting. There
were girls in mini-skirts, in slacks
suits, in jeans, in shorts, and parad-
ing the lawn there were some most
interesting subjects in thongs.
The races had their unusual
moments. Tn the first rare, the deri-
“I backed the winner, at
05 to 1 ...!"
sion seemed clear-cut, the winner
came home by a good head, but
the judges put up the wrong horse.
The crowd began to boo. The
judges took down the numbers and
put up the same ones again. The
crowd this time hollered such
remarks as “Come orf it.” The
numbers were pulled down once
more and put up correctly.
For most races there were as
many scratchings as starters and in
the Great Western Handicap, for
which there should have been ten,
there were only three. This was the
race of the day over a .mile with
$240 in prizes. The three horses
were Tinted Petal, Wee Mark, and
Miss Dotson. Miss Dotson rather
spoiled things 'by doing a buck-
jumping act and galloping off
among the cars. The jockey was
about to dismount when the crowd
shouted: “Go on, mate, you gotta
get third money.” So, long after
Tinted Petal had triumphed, Miss
Dotson went after her, to collect her
$2B of the stake.
There were parties out among
the trees, easily as good as those
you find in the members’ car park
at Flemington. One party of four
had tables with white cloths, plenty
of chicken, and they had a large
barrel full of ice to cool their
bottle of champers.
The Vintage Car Club made the
meeting the highlight of a rally to
Horsham. Perhaps the most beauti-
ful car there was a Bugatti 37A
owned by Laurie Rofe, of Mitcham.
It won the 1929 Grand Prix at
Phillip Island by a quarter of an
hour, and now, 38 years later, it
could still do 110. Indeed, it has
been known to make the Lakeland
hill climb in 38.8 seconds, the same
time as a lj-litre Cooper-Climax.
After the last race at Great
Western it is always the tradition
to retire to Seppelts’ cellars. Last
year over 200 arrived and the
champagne drinking had almost a
frenetic quality. This year it was
by card and invitation only. The
refreshments were champagne and
cheese, and the host was Les Fran-
cis, manager of Great Western. It
was fascinating to be there close to
the incredible underground drives of
Great Western, which now have a
plaque and the blessings of the
National Trust.
And for those of us who failed to
win a cent all day there was the
reassuring thought that under our
feet were 1J million bottles of
champagne, quietly maturing.

Singeing the Critics’ Beards
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
HAVE critics canonised themselves
at the expense of creative writers?
Is writing a craft that can be
taught anyway? These were some of
the questions we raised this year at the
first of a series of annual Writers’
Retreats held by the University of New
England. Financial backing came from
the Myer Foundation and the Austra-
lian Book Publishers’ Association.
Writers are notoriously difficult cows
to milk, even on the temperate plateau
of New England and with the pleasures
of nearby Armidale, that city of harpsi-
chord shops and Greek milk bars sell-
ing fruit drinks appetisingly entitled
“Dolphin” and “Phosphate.” However,
Derek Whitelock, who first thought of
the Retreat, piloted it through with
considerable skill and ensured that
tutors of the standing of Kenneth Sles-
sor, Judith Wright, Tom Keneally,
Frank Hardy, John Thompson, and Ivan
Southall were able to help the writers
with their manuscripts and give talks
to those who wanted to listen.
Derek Whitelock was also responsible
for the name “Writers’ Retreat,” which
was a very happy invention, as it made
it clear that writers who wanted to get
on with their work were under no
obligation to attend the social functions
and discussions which had been
arranged. Most of the writers were
helped on technical problems by the
tutors who enabled them to clinch a
novel or poem which may otherwise
have been put away in a drawer to
gather dust.
J>IGHT from the start there was an
atmosphere of tremendous enthusi-
asm and dedication among the 15
writers, whose ages ranged from 23 to
39.
A Niagara of poems, novels, plays,
and short stories poured from our
typewriters, while in nearby fields a
cow might be seen rubbing her fore-
head on a fence post. Robb College,
where we retreated, is very fine archi-
tecture and has a monastic calm, and
at night you could stroll down its car-
peted corridors and listen to the fre-
netic clatter of typewriters and the occa-
sional sinister ripping up of discarded
manuscripts.
There was at first a bit of friction
with the Music School which was
housed nearby and had wind-groups
playing what was said to be a neo-
classical version of “Roll Out the Bar-
rel” by Poulenc. The writers swarmed
from their typewriters like a mob of
angry hornets, posted up caustic poems
on the notice board and retaliated by
playing Zorba as loudly as possible
from a tape-recorder. However, dif-
ferences were soon ironed out and most
of us were genuinely sorry, I think,
when the musicians left.
Life of the party was Frank Hardy,
who told stories non-stop from mid-
night to midnight. Frank’s stories of
Bill Harney and Northern Terri-
torians, and the town drunkard No-
Gargle who was beaten in an ice-cream
eating competition by Father Devaney’s
dog, did more than merely entertain.
They helped underline that we were
all Australians and that a writer’s sub-
ject matter is people. Ken Slessor also
came out strongly in favor of an Aus-
tralian way of speech.
As one of the century’s major poets,
Ken impressed us all with his tremen-
dous modesty and humility. Frank
Hardy told a classic story illustrating
this. Frank was talking to a drinking
mate about his impending trip to Armi-
dale and mentioned that Slessor would
also be up there. His friend, who had
known Slessor well over a number of
years, exclaimed incredulously, “Old
Ken, eh? What’s he doing up there?”
Each of the tutors was able to con-
tribute some quite different insight,
Ivan Southall as a quiet and dedicated
writer of children’s stories and non-
fiction, John Thompson as a prominent
poet and broad-
caster, and Tom
Keneally as a very
modest but gifted
writer of poetic
prose novels. Frank
Hardy had some
pungent things to
say about negotia-
ting contracts with
pub 1 i shers. Dr.
Andrew Fabinyi, as
a visitor, gave us an
outline of publish-
ing.
At one stage some
of the members of
the Retreat made a
strong attack on
critics and the study
of literature at an
academic level, and
blamed it for the
current obscurity
and inbreeding of
modern literature.
The game of hunt-
the-symbol was a
much more lucra-
tive source for Ph.
D’s than to praise
the work of some
writer who was
lucid and unpre-
tentious. Clem
Christesen came
flying to the defence
of the critics and
jocularly accused
the attackers of
philistinism. Judith Wright then
attacked aspects of the critical industry
and said the writer must listen to the
voice inside him and must not be too
aware of what people were saying
about him.
Judith Wright made a very great
and warm impact on the Retreaters
with her charm and directness of man-
ner. She is someone whose personality
is every bit as rich as her poetry. As
well as being a major poet with mysti-
cal elements, she is a conservation
expert and a very straightforward
countrywoman. Suggesting the future
lines along which poetry would develop,
she said, “I have carried on a line
started by Coleridge and developed to
its ultimate fulfilment by Rilke, but
thought can no longer be the basis of
poetry. As a woman I have always
had feeling in my poetry, but it
has been absent from men’s poetry for
a long time. The young poets must
now speak from the heart and to
people, and I see this in all the poets
here.”
A final postscript. Ken Slessor
announced after a poetry reading that
he was amazed by the quality and range
of the work and that “this should be
called not a Writers’ Retreat but a
Writers’ Advance.” John Manifold
immediately hopped up and said, “I
hereby nominate Ken for the first
ambassadorial post of a free, republican
Australia.”

Macquarie in the Suburbs
By APRIL HERSEY
PROFESSOR A. G. MITCHELL,
Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie
University, is awaiting the arrival
of his first 700 undergraduates with
some fascination. Reputed to be the
“dead year” in universities in New
South Wales when the normal influx
of students has been stayed by the
long arm of Dr. Wyndham and his
sixth year of high school, this should
be the year for anyone who has missed
an academic chance in the past.
“We really don’t know what our
student body will be like, but we are
pretty certain that quite a number of
them will be older and more mature
than the usual youngsters straight from
school,” he said.
Those who have chosen Macquarie
should do well, since 19 professors with
the university motto “And Gladly
teche” in mind, and all determined
to prove the success of their new voca-
tions and the value of life at Eastwood,
are waiting capped, gowned, and eager
to pour their knowledge on the thirsty
minds.
Already a group of postgraduate
students are working from Macquarie,
though much of their work has to be
done in CSIRO laboratories and at
Sydney University’s Fisher Library. “It
is interesting that we will be confer-
ring our first doctorates before we
confer any bachelor degrees,” Professor
Mitchell said. “The faculty was very
keen to have postgraduate students
here as well so that they would not
be confined to first-year students.”
is likely to set a break-
away tradition in teaching in that
courses will be fragmented to allow a
flexibility of approach. For instance,
anyone will be able to take a course
on computer logic and mathematics at
the School of Mathematics and Physics
whether they apply their computer
knowledge to the study of geology or
behavioural and social sciences. In the
same way a scientist will be able to
take a course in poetry if he wants
to. The system of crediting each course
will mean that the student will not
lose by his wider interest. It is hard
to estimate from this whether it is
going to be easier or harder to get a
degree at Macquarie, but obviously
computers are going to be busy work-
ing out the rather complicated credit
system.
In the years to come other courses
including Medicine and Law will come
to Macquarie. At the present time
there is considerably more mud than
grass around the buildings, but the
332 acres which stretch away in two
gentle folds, merging into the Lane
Cove National Park, are very lovely
and provide an almost perfect setting
for a campus. It is intended to keep
the buildings in a close-knit complex
rather than setting them far afield.
This will help to keep the university
life turned inward instead of being
separated in self-contained buildings.
A really magnificent piece of engineer-
ing carries light, gas, water, and, in
fact, all services through a 99in.-wide
pipe under the buildings. High enough
to allow the workmen to stand, and
well lit, the pipe is reached from a
sort of pill-box above ground. It will
mean that unsightly pipes and poles
are never seen on the airy campus.
“The air is so fresh here,” Professor
Mitchell said. “I can actually smell
the city air now when I go into town.
I had never realised when I worked
there what it was like, but now I am
aware of the difference.”
Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Sydney
University until 1964, when he
accepted the challenge of Macquarie,
Mitchell had been McCaughey Pro-
fessor of Early English Literature and
Language since 1947. His published
works include “Pronunciation of Eng-
lish in Australia,” “The Use of Eng-
lish,” and “Spoken English.” Last year
he toured the United States and was
particularly concerned with visiting
new universities.
“They always took me in proudly
to show me the master plan,” he said.
“Well, our council has so far avoided
a very static master plan because the
emphasis can change so completely in
education in a matter of years. What
we hope is that the flexibility of our
ideas will keep up at least level with
prevailing thought, if not one jump
ahead, until we reach our 10,000-
student level which I feel will be our
maximum.”
They have already carried off one
very successful experiment. By cover-
ing a courtyard with transparent roof-
ing they have obtained a place of
assembly 90ft. by 60ft., three storeys
high, capable of seating 1000 people,
and according to the experts at the
ABC, acoustically perfect. All this for
the price of the roof $60,000.
Professor Mitchell is hopefully
regarding Macquarie as very much the
university for the North Shore, since
it is strategically placed to enable that
41 percent of all university students
enrolled in Sydney universities who
emerge each day from the northside
to cut their travelling time in half.
Travelling, of course, is not every-
thing in university life, and anyone
looking for a sprig of ivy will have
to take it with him to Macquarie.
“We were concerned with getting our
first buildings into a functional state to
facilitate education,” Professor Mitchell
said. “We had very little time—in fact,
only two years before the commence-
ment of the first term, which is
scheduled for March 6, 1967. And we
only just made it under the wire.”
Though a group of architects and
engineers has been retained and Mr.
W. V. Abraham is the Architect Plan-
ner, the first building erected is actu-
ally a repetition of the component
parts of the Carslaw building at Syd-
ney University. Because working plans-
were available for this, the long build-
ing was rearranged and stacked eight
storeys high at Macquarie, with the
laboratories placed in an adjoining
building.
Lines are austere, and narrow reces-
sed windows provide sun control with-
out benefit of curtains. Interiors are
very simple, the only luxury an occa-
sional stretch of carpeting, though
quarry tiles prevail on all the most used
areas. The space has been divided on a
module of 10ft. x 15ft. Strictly demo-
. cratic, but fair—it’s one module for a
lecturer’s study, two for a professor,
and three for the Vice-Chancellor.
QNLY three exterior materials have
been used, metals (including copper
and bronze), brick, and off-the-form
concrete. The brick is not red. The
choice was rather mellow greyish-
blue brick which looks well against
the distant hills. No wood has been
used and no maintenance will be re-
quired. “Fifty years from now,” Mit-
chell said, “we should have a quarter
of a million more books in the
library because we’ve built without
frills.”
The library, in fact, is already rising
fast and there are 70,000 books wait-
ing for a shelf. Money is available for
an immediate purchase of books. Mr.
D. B. Scott, the librarian, was one of
the first persons to be appointed to the
new university. So far $5 million has
been spent on Macquarie and another
$8 million is available.
“We have actually been very for->-
tunate all along,” Professor Mitchell
said, “luckier than the University of’
N.S.W., for instance. We have been,
independent from the beginning, which
has given us an opportunity to throw
off old traditions and comparisons.
And also the precedent for having more
than one university in the city has
been accepted.
So the halls of learning wait for
the seekers after truth. The theatre is
ready for the lecturer, the $60,000 hall
awaits the first assembly, the labora-
tories stretch cool, equipped, and empty
waiting for the scientist, the long
sunny galleries await the arguments of
the young philosophers, and out in the
grounds a little grassy amphitheatre,
brilliantly conceived, produced when a
creek had to be filled, waits for its
first Greek drama. Hail Macquarie!

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Morley Off the Cuff
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
MR. ROBERT MORLEY’S voice,
booming from a second-floor
balcony, directed us to his Point
Piper flat. He was, in fact, being inter-
viewed by a gentleman from the ABC,
and on the balcony beneath a lady in
green sat bolt upright, as if mesmerised
by the monologue above.
He’d been at it since ten o’clock and
with two more interviews booked in
each hour, on the hour, that took Mr.
Morley nicely to noon, when he was
itching to get to town to see the
theatre. For his interviews, he had
elected to dress formally in blue suit
and tie, grey socks, and orange shoes,
because the day before he had looked
rather casual on arrival at the airport.
Rising suddenly from the basket
chair, he pumped the ABC man’s hand,
Robert Morley
suggested a brilliant idea for an inter-
view with a difference, darling, said it
was a pleasure meeting him, dear boy,
and the ABC man, who had clearly
never been addressed thus before,
thanked Mr. Morley for his coffee and
withdrew.
The thing about being interviewed,
says Mr. Morley, is everyone expects
you to have something to say. They’d
ring him up with questions and often
he’d have no answer, but lo and behold!
next morning he’d read he’s said some-
thing or they’d get whatever he had
said wrong —but that was understand-
able, because he may have said it wrong
in the first place—and, no, it wasn’t
worth writing a letter putting it right,
he never had and he never would.
What he thinks is dreadful, is the
journalist who is told something off
the cuff and who then reports it. Like
that man who printed his confidential,
unfavorable views on Melbourne when
he last came to Australia 16 years ago,
and then wrote a letter of apology. If
that had happened in London he would
have been fired. (The thing about inter-
viewing Mr. Morley is some of his best
bits are off the cuff.)
Anyway, in Sydney at least, Mr.
Morley’s comfort is assured. The
Phillip Theatre management have taken
this Point Piper flat, which includes a
Greek maid and her four-year-old son;
BMC has given him a car (he hopes
it’s given); and an Admiral on the other
side of the road has offered him the
use of his beach. He also has some good
friends in Sydney, including the Deky-
vores, so Mr. Morley will not be lonely.
On stage, as the title of his show,
'The Sound of Morley A One-Man
Band,” implies, he is dreadfully lonely.
As the entire cast, he found certain
difficulty rehearsing, but his way round
this was to work with a director who
<at in the stalls and shouted at him
now and again, “STOP! That won’t
do.” He has rehearsed one month for
his two-hour show, but Mr. Morley
hopes, indeed he prays, a certain amount
of ad libbing will be forthcoming on
die stage. He doesn’t want to repeat
the same things night after night. We
discussed the possibility of his bringing
down his own curtain, moving his own
stage props. He shut his eyes tight and
meditated. Then, finally: “No. I’d like
to, but I am already indulging in a
little movement.” But what did we
think about putting Graham Greene
into a room with a duster and getting
him to think his thoughts aloud?
J)IGGING, as far as was delicate, into
Mr. Morley’s eating habits (his
reaction was one of rather hurt surprise
. . . “Well, I suppose I do eat quite a
bit, but I have a large stomach and it
has to be filled. I am served a huge por-
tion and always finish it before anyone
else”), we discovered that a year ago
he inflicted on himself the extreme tor-
ture of diet. He went to one of those
health places, where they fed him
nothing but grapefruit every day and
gave him a final cherry “for being
good.” The reason for this odd
behaviour was that he was doing Bat-
man in America and in the script
noticed quite a considerable amount of
exertion was needed (“a mattress-
stuffing machine was going to press
rosettes into my chest”) and thought
a little less build would lessen the
danger. But Batman, for various off-
the-cuff reasons, did not materialise.

Sixteen stone slipped up to seventeen
and all that grapefruit —and cherry—
was wasted. Mr. Morley is a philoso-
phical sort of fellow, and accepts set-
backs of this kind with a long, lingering
smile.
What does amaze him is that Play-
boy magazine should commission an
article from him on The Six Best
Hotels, for which they are paying
$l5OO. He had hoped to go to some
luxurious hotels and inform the
management he was writing an article
on them, but Playboy said he should
stay at home and write about the six
best he already knew. One way or
another, his writing (he calls it comedy-
pieces) brings him in fairly handsome
returns. His recently published book,
“Responsible Gentleman,” was serialised
by the London “Sunday Express” for
£3OOO sterling, and for this he probably
has to thank his co-writer, Sewell
Stokes, who flattered his writing style
so much he got it finished. There is
nothing like a few compliments, says
Mr. Morley, for encouragement. Sewell
would say, “No one’s ever used with
and whatever in one sentence before
in the whole world, it’s marvellous!”
But time, we venture to suggest, may-
have mellowed Robert Morley since he
last graced the shores of Australia. He
could not possibly say whether he likes
Sydney any better (or worse), but he
certainly hopes the taxis have im-
proved. He was clearly suspicious
when we inquired whether he would
resist “social advances,” and on this
trip (unlike his last) he appears to be
in accord with the theatrical manage-
ment. Eric Duckworth, he confided,
couldn’t be more charming. “What
about,” he suggested suddenly, “bring-
ing out my mother-in-law, Gladys
Cooper. She’s dying to do a one-woman
show. She’s dying to come to Australia,
in fact. What a good idea!” He beamed
with enthusiasm. Mr. Duckworth’s
bacon was saved by that good old
theatrical ploy, a ring on the door-
bell, and in walked the 12 o’clock
interviewer . . . “Now tell me, dear
boy, do you enjoy your work?” we
heard Mr. Morley inquire as we
walked across the road to the car. “Of
course, if you do, it isn’t work, is it?

schner.

tryk.
THE social responsibility of the
artist is a vexed question. How
far should he be allowed to
regard himself as outside everyday
human responsibilities? Because he has
extraordinary gifts, should he be per-


mitted a licence of behaviour beyond
the ordinary?
In dealing with the question, Karel
Reisz’s “Morgan” came out strongly
on the side of irresponsibility. Morgan
was presented in a vague sort of
way as an “artist” and a special sort
of person (though the only remark-
able* talent he seemed to possess was
that of being a useless nuisance) who
was finally hounded into a well-
merited booby-hatch by the beastly
forces of conformism.
In his serio-comic study of the poet
Samson Shillitoe, Irvin Kerschner
avoids any allocation of blame. Shilli-
toe and society clash, not because either
of them is wrong but because they are
made differently. Neither the bull nor
the china shop is to blame for all
that broken crockery: they are simply
two things that can’t meet without
disaster.
It is perhaps a fault in the film that
Kerschner sometimes leans too far to-
ward the farcical. But in general his
lighthearted treatment doesn’t contra-
dict the basic seriousness of his theme;
there’s an attractive feeling of warmth
and generosity about the movie far
removed from the bitchy spite that was
never far below the surface of “Mor-
gan.” And he avoids the temptation to
make the representatives of conformism
into absurd caricatures (with the
exception of the Ladies’ Literary Lun-
cheoners, who deserve it).
But perhaps the film’s biggest
achievement is in presenting a believ-
able poet. Shillitoe is the genuine
article, not just a layabout using artis-
tic temperament as an excuse for idle
selfishness. That Sean Connery makes
the man entirely convincing may sur-
prise those who identify him solely
with James Bond but not those who
have seen “The Hill” or “An Age
Of Kings”; it has been objected that
he doesn’t “look right,” but surely
poetry has outgrown the drooping,
sensitive-plant image, if it ever deserved
it.
In a vital, raucous performance,
Joanne Woodward makes a fit mate
for Shillitoe. Ted McCord’s photog-
raphy no doubt makes New York glow
more brightly than it probably is but
mirrors the heightened visual sensi-
tivity of the poet.
“Alvarez Kelly” will hardly add to
or detract from Edward Dmytryk’s
reputation, but it’s a good example of
the standard Western, interesting in
theme, capably made, and toward the
end visually exciting. William Holden
underacts rather well; Richard Wid-
mark overacts quite badly; and Pat-
rick O’Neal, whose subtle portrayal of
the psychiatrist is one of the great
pleasures of “A Fine Madness,” again
contributes a complex and interesting
performance, though afflicted with a
Union Officer’s uniform that gives him
the appearance of a Civil War Robin
Hood.

AFTER the Christmas lull Sydney
theatre has sprung to life again
with a variety of comedies.
In “O’Flaherty, V.C., which was
written in 1915 and sub-titled “A Re-
cruiting Pamphlet,” Shaw concerned
himself with the ludicrous inappro-
priateness of trying to recruit Irish
soldiers to the British Army by talking
about patriotism.
O’Flaherty, V.C., fresh from shaking
hands with the King at Buckingham
Palace, has just arrived home on a
recruiting campaign with his general,
Sir Pearce Madigan, who is also his
local squire. In honor of the occasion,
Sir Pearce has invited old Mrs.
O’Flaherty to tea. O’Flaherty’s great
problem is to conceal from his mother,
a fierce Irish patriot, that he has been
fighting for the English not the Ger-
mans.
Peter O’Shaughnessy’s fast-moving
production of this lucid and good-
humored comedy is a delight. Kerry
Francis gives an intelligent perform-
ance as the candid O’Flahertv. Ron
Graham is excellent as the blimpish Sir
Pearce, scandalised by O’Flaherty’s
revelation that the Irish are not true
British patriots. Gillian Hunter is
spirited as the pretty colleen who turns
out to be interested chiefly in
O’Flaherty’s pension. Moya O’Sulli-
van’s Mrs. O’Flaherty is a skilful comic
study, but I think she misconceives
this “Volumnia of the potato patch”
in making her such a shrill old witch.
“Royal Gambit” is a historical-
philosophical comedy, translated from
the German, about Henry VIII and
his six wives, in which he and they
are the only characters. As Henry pro-
ceeds inexorably from wife to wife,
Katharine of Aragon explains to him
at intervals what he is about. Henry,
we are told, is the first modern man.
He invented a new kind of hypocrisy
which enabled him to do exactly as
he pleased while talking all the time
about his conscience. A dramatist like
Shaw could have done a lot with this
idea, but Gressieker does not do very
much.
The Padgiante Theatre Company,
pronounced, simply, “pageant,” but
standing for, pretentiously, “Producers,
actors, designers grouped in a nucleus
of theatrical endeavor,” is a new group
of young people. Peter Whitford and
the six actresses show talent and com-
petence, but their play is too thin to
excite the imagination.
“Sweet Charity” is an odd mixture
of gritty, sophisticated send-up and
bland sweet corn, cream-style. Charity
Hope Valentine is a lost Cinderella
who keeps her innocence in a cynical,
heart-breaking world. She is a taxi-
dancer in the Fan Dango Ballroom,
New York. “We don’t dance,” says one
of the hostesses, “we defend ourselves
to music.”
Nancye Hayes as Charity is sweet,
youthful, and valiant as she sings and
dances her strenuous way through the
long evening with professional skill.
But, in this great barn of a theatre,
her voice and her personality seemed
a shade too light. Peter Adams as
Charity’s boyfriend Oscar shows hirpself
an accomplished comedian as a claus-
trophobic stuck in a lift.
John Llewellyn’s presentation of
Dylan Thomas’ poetry is very different
in style from Dylan Thomas’ own
presentation. Mr. Llewellyn is all flam-
boyance and histrionics, with a fine
Welsh voice and a fine Welsh presence.
Dylan Thomas was a little man with
an English accent and an informal
manner. At least, he was like that at
a poetry reading of his which I
attended. Remembering his quiet but
intense speaking of “Do Not Go Gentle
into that Good Night,” I found John
Llewellyn’s flamboyance distracted
me from the poem. However, when it
came to the lively and amusing “A
Child’s Christmas in Wales,” John
Llewellyn was excellent.
In the second half of his program,
with the aid of some recorded voices,
he presents a sadly chopped-up version
of “Under Milk Wood.” In this his
Welsh accent is invaluable and he gives
some enjoyable vignettes as blind Cap-
tain Cat, sightlessly staring at the past,
and as that extraordinary trio, Mr.
Ogmore, Mr. Pritchard, and Mrs.
Ogmore Pritchard.

ART
Medium Over Matter
Texture Survey: Barry Stern’s Gal-
lery, Sydney.
Robert Boynes: Hungry Horse Gal-
lery, Sydney.
THE texture survey at Stern’s with
nine artists exploring a variety of
heaped, rocky, gouged, pitted or
subtly raised surfaces, and one, Ron
Lambert, incising a more orthodox
oil-paint impasto, should help indicate
that texture painting, far from being a
modern eccentricity, is close to the
centre of some 20th-century thinking.
One need only recall how emphatically
Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Cummings,
Dylan Thomas, and Robbe-Grillet
direct attention to their medium, how
they reject the notion of the supremacy
of the art that conceals art and how
the medium, instead of being used as
the quickest possible access to their
subject matter, becomes a large part
of the content. With painters like
Tapies, or, at Stern’s, Peter Clarke or
Terry Sellers, the material is almost
the sole subject matter.
The drive to impurity in media is a
reaction against the apotheosis of the
brushstroke in oil and against the idea
that art must so transcend its medium
that not a trace of the means remains;
it is not a question of “truth to
materials” but of a painting as an
object that gives evidence of its genesis.
Texture painting rarely remains pure
in its impurity; it spills over into other
modes like junk-assemblage, dada, and
collage; it is collage that ties it to
early cubism and at Stern’s Juan
Almoril slices his surface into flat-
patterned cubist paddocks; Peter
Clarke’s small work masses shapes in
a cubist-collage manner.
Collage, despite its abruptness, is
generally an intimate medium, subject
to gentle shifts of feeling, and it is the
two worn pieces of hessian that human-
ise Sellers’ pierced, white blockhouse
wall. The work here that most evokes
fragility is almost purely collage: Gor-
don Samstag’s floating grey and white
clouds, bearing fibrous thistledown as
they traverse a land of smooth, gold
paper.
Texture painting emerged from
bombed Europe, from interest in pri-
mordial impulses and archaeology: Arch
Cuthbertson’s three figures emerge,
scarred and lumpy from the gloom and
his circular shield resembles a polished
archaeological find; William Ferguson
has an incised religio-magical totem
that recalls Ernst and, more impor-
tantly, texture painting’s association
with surrealism.
The remoteness, stillness, reserve,
singleness of impact and classical sev-
erity of texture painting is best exempli-
fied here with Sellers, Peascod’s stretch
of torn land in grey wastes, and Clarke’s,
momentarily arrested slow flow of
sandy materials; the baroque love of
violence and of ruins appears respect-
ively in Jan Riske and Gordon Rintoul,
the former presenting a tall slice of red,
boiling lava, that surges at the edges
and the latter sending matt-black
rivers through pebbled shores and blue-
tinted sandy flats.
Such a survey could hardly be com-
plete: there are others such as Sheila
McDonald, Marmol and John Neeson
of Melbourne and if Lambert, why not
that master of piled and curdled pig-
ment, Guy Grey-Smith? Certainly other
galleries could well emulate Mr. Stein
with surveys based on seminal subjects
and modes.
Robert boynes, of Adelaide, who,
like Sellers, is a real addition to
the scene, employs a flat-patterned
cubism that has all the abrupt shifts of
collage and photomontage to surround
and counterpoint the softer rhythms and
more resilient surfaces of a variety of
nudes, some speckled with an atomiser,
some silhouetted, and some given names
like doll, idol, sinner, and frump.
One work, called “Sensuous Decep-
tion,” epitomises his balance of nudity,
never too sensuous, against the hard
facts of Cubism. Here, as elsewhere,
the angled areas, generally uniform in
color, press rather relentlessly on the
centre and present some startling
juxtapositions between shape and hue,
particularly in “Pay Me A Compli-
ment,” a request easily complied with.
The juxtapositions can be so abrupt
and the color so formidable that he
seems to be denying a French ancestry,
but there’s more to his sudden, shifting
emphases than this, for he is trying
to get depth and movement from
varied focal points something one"
cannot enjoy in most puritanical hard-
edge abstractionists who’ll think Mr.
Boynes a good man fallen for women.
It can be best studied in “Pivot Sus-
pension,” where the nude is cunningly
off-balance with the three-dimensional
boxes whose facets set the eye tossing;
like a ping-pong ball.
Boynes is rather assertive and would
lose nothing if he withdrew his forces
a little from what is quite a strong
position.

BOOKS
Big Brother Brophy
By JAMES KIRKUP
Don’t Never Forget. Brigid Brophy.
Cape. $6.15.
WHAT the present depressed state
of British creative writing needs
is the love of a bad woman. It
has got it in the person of Brigid
Brophy. One has only to look at her
photograph on the cover: if only she
had been propping her chin on her
hand she would have been Rimbaud.
She appears as a mauvaise fille, a
gangster’s moll, almost a femme fatale.
She reminds me of the publicity slogan
once attached to Jane Russell: “She’s
mean, moody, and magnificent.”
The fingers, wrists, and forearms dis-
played in the photograph look firm and
capable the equipment of a surgeon,
a concert pianist, and a weightlifter.
(She says, in the excellent essay on
Kathrin Perutz, “. . . let me insist that
in writing, as indeed in handwriting,
there is ... no such thing as ‘a
feminine hand.’ ”) But it is the face that
fascinates: it is two different but almost
identical faces put together fairly care-
fully. (She refers, in one of her most
dazzling essays, “The Rights of
Animals,” to the reader’s “Identikit
portrait of me.”) The left half of her
face appears to be slightly larger than
the right half. If one covers the right
half, one finds a dreamer’s face; if the
left half, a Fury or a basilisk. The gen-
eral effect of these combined, lowering
stares is Medusa-like.
'J'HE twin character of the Dreamer
and the Fury is very apparent in
this book. Miss Brophy is a rational
idealist, but her rationalism and her
idealism do not conflict: they exist side
by side and she sees no need to recon-
cile them. The Dreamer manifests her-
self in the brilliantly argued essays,
reminiscent of Shelley, in the sec-
tion “Morals and Manners,” from
which we are pleased to learn
that Miss Brophy is a vegetarian,
a would-be eater of human meat,
an anti-vivisectionist, a campaigner for
absolute equality of the sexes and the
revision of tiresome British sex and
obscenity laws. (She bashes D. H.
Lawrence over the head for his phil-
istinism in the latter respect.) In “The
British Sense of Humor” she makes a
devastating and long-deserved attack
on the railway bookstall humor of
Kingsley Amis, Jerome K. Jerome, and,
by extension, of all that horde of feeble
contemporary novelists belonging to the
“Wain-Braine School.” Such a tart
putting-in-place of those facetious sixth-
formers has long been needed.
Miss Brophy makes a more extended
but equally deflating foray into Amis-
land in another penetratingly scornful
essay, “Lucky Jim,” in which he is
equated with “Just William.” One of
the points she holds up to ridicule and
contempt is Jim’s reference to “filthy
Mozart.” “Don’t Never Forget” (the
title is taken from one of Mozart’s
letters) includes essays on Pergolesi and
Mozart that are little short of idola-
trous, and rightly so.
Our author is capable of idolatry
toward literary figures, too, and one
of the chief attractions of her book
for me is that she writes with such
appreciative and witty insight about
my own favorite (and —in provincial,
insular literary Britain at least—gener-
ally rather despised) authors, Elizabeth
Taylor, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Ronald
Firbank, Jean Genet, Colette, and
Francoise Sagan. Her comments on
the last-named are particularly satisfy-
ing, with their scorching references to
English literary chauvinism. I wish she
had also written about another of my
favorites, Vladimir Nabokov.
She is excellent on Sartre: “. . . all
those words that have made him the
writer of some of the most interesting
books of our century but never one
of our century’s most interesting writ-
ers.” Her most brilliant assessment of
Sartre’s inadequacies comes in her
essay on Genet, when, commenting on
Sartre’s introduction to “Notre Dame
des Fleurs,” she says:
He (Sartre) is noble and grotesque,
this impresario who, apparently blind
and deaf to the talents of his pro-
digy, nonetheless intuitively and
generously feels there is something
in him, and goes stumbling round
and round while he tries to think
what on earth it can be . . .
That, and the passage following it, is
a piece of magnificent writing. It is not
only literary criticism; it is also the
analysis of human character. The same
novelist’s technique is applied in a mer-
ciless and hilarious portrait of Henry
Miller. The most entertaining and
revealing paragraph of this shattering
expose begins:
Since the war I have seen him in
many parts of Europe, usually in the
evening and in a cafe: He is loud-
mouthed, bodily coarse and dressed
in ugly clothes designed visibly to
mop up his sweat. He is drunk
on incredibly little alcohol, if you
bother to check up and may be
going to vomit on the floor. He is
boasting to the other Americans he
is with, (he is always with other
Americans), and boasting inaccu-
rately. He may be tipping them the
wink about the places which are the
Brigid Brophy
real thing, where tourists don’t go
in which case he is quite likely to
name the Folies Bergere . . .
A similar ferocity gives intense
pleasure in the sketch of that literary
carthorse Simone de Beauvoir, “the
most-over-estimated presence in post-
war French writing.” Discussing what
one hopes is the final chunk of Mad-
ame’s autobiography, we find this
remark: “She records that she laughed,
but nothing, in the whole eighteen
years, which struck her as funny.” This
I can vouch from personal experience,
for I was the translator (I needed the
money) of the first chunk, “Memoirs
of a Dutiful Daughter,” a task that was
sheer torture. Madame, who never
cracked a joke in her life, had the
nerve to complain (as the British
publishers apologetically told me) that
I had “missed all her jokes.” The
translation, which I have refrained
from reading since typing it out, was
badly .mauled and “edited” quite with-
out my consent by the American pub-
lishers, but even they were apparently
unable to infuse clarity and humor into
one of the most banal, turgid, and
incompetent styles in French literature,
a style admirably defined by Big
Brother Brophy in the following terms:
Sense' of style Mile de Beauvoir
seems to lack utterly. She claims “a
certain rigor” for the style of this
book but that is almost as ironic
as her fear of sounding pedantic if
she finishes her sentences in conver-
sation. So far is she from pedantry
that in this book she does not get
the middle of her sentences syntacti-
cally correct. The participles and
phrases which float, unattached or
wrongly attached, through the trans-
lation (by Richard Howard) are
faithful renderings of the French text
Another outstanding quality in this
book is the author’s ability to reawaken
our interest in writers we had forgot-
ten or misjudged, and among these
resurrections none is more convincing


than that of John Horne Burns, an
almost tragically underestimated
American novelist: I can hardly wait
to get my hands on his novels again.
Miss Brophy properly demolishes the
sillier side of Virginia Woolf and abso-
lutely annihilates A. L. Rowse (“a
Rowse on the rocks of literature”), but
she overestimates the importance of
Katherine Mansfield (a nasty girl) and
Louisa M. Alcott (my favorite child-
hood novelist). Yet between these
necessary extremes of an extreme
intelligence she maintains a marvellous
clear-eyed critical judgment, a gusty
gaiety, and a perfect balance of fury
and dream, of passion and detachment.
This is unique in contemporary British
criticism. Miss Brophy is not just an-
other of that monstrous regiment of
women writers Muriel Spark, Mar-
garet Drabble, Iris Murdoch, Susan
Sonntag, and Edna O’Brien. (All these
she ignores in favor of more genuinely
talented novelists like Gillian Freeman,
Janice Elliott, Hortense Calisher,
Elizabeth Taylor, and Kathrin Perutz.)
Badwoman Brophy is a creature apart,
a priestess whose seriousness and
humanity are well expressed in the
quotation from Keats’ letters which she
uses as her epigraph:
I am certain of nothing but of the
holiness of the Heart’s affections
and the truth of Imagination.
We badly need this Bad Girl Brophy,
who is cruel without the slightest inten-
tion of being kind.
The Muse at Cocktails
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Ample Proposition. John Lehmann.
Eyre and Spottiswoode. $7.
IN 1967 “Penguin New Writing” is
perhaps to most people no more
than a nostalgic memory. Yet to
look into any one of its numbers is
to feel again the excitement of literary
adventure. For here many readers met
for the first time poems by Edith Sit-
well, William Plomer, Louis Macneice,
Boris Pasternak, and many less familiar
names; an unfinished novel by Graham
Greene, a story by Lionel Trilling; and
critical articles such as those by Helen
Gardner on Francois Mauriac, Walter
Allen on D. H. Lawrence, or Stephen
Spender on the realist novel. Each
number bears witness to John Leh-
mann’s catholic tastes, his wide liter-
ary knowledge, and his delight in all
the arts. “The Ample Proposition”
takes up the story of his life toward
the end of the great years of “Penguin
New Writing,” and it shows us a man
whose passion for literature is no less,
but whose means, private and public,
for promoting it are gradually declin-
ing. This is the story of great ambition,
considerable success and failure a
failure which, he confesses, has left “a
certain sour taste of frustration.”
The dominant note of the book is
not, however, frustration. John Leh-
mann has the gift for describing even
. his losing battles with something like
zest. The years he recalls saw the
death of “Penguin New Writing,” the
success and failure of his own publish-
ing firm, the highlight of which was
his “Modern European Library,” and
the short reign of his radio program
“New Soundings.” To look back on
these ventures now is to feel that, with
the exception of “Penguin New Writ-
ing,” the failures were more resounding
than the successes, and to wonder that
“the sour taste of frustration” was not
more often in his mouth than it appears
to have been. His persistence and buoy-
ancy are a remarkable tribute to the
sustaining power of his many literary
friendships, and of literature itself. In
all that he did he was inspired by an
enthusiastic desire to encourage and
promote new talent,
H IS ambitions were not realised with-
out sacrifice. In promoting the
talents of others he was forced to neg-
lect his own, and “The Ample Propo-
sition” is in part the story of a man
divided against himself. “Part of my
mind,” he admits, “when I was running
a literary magazine or a publishing
enterprise, always regretted the time I
could have devoted to my own poems
and books.” In the invitation to write
his autobiography he saw “a partial
resolution” of his problem. He came
to feel that this was a perhaps rather
belated gift from his good angel,
and to see it as the opportunity “to
make a work of art out of the story of
how I had through all my adult life
been unable to choose finally whether
to make works of art myself or be the
impresario of others engaged in this
difficult life . . .” Mr. Lehmann can-
not be said to have converted the oppor-
tunity into reality. In spite of its prom-
ising theme, “The Ample Proposition”
is not a work of art. It is too casual
and unselective. For all his zest and
buoyancy Mr. Lehmann does not really
succeed in making his memories and
experiences interesting.
He has, one would suppose, every-
thing in his favor a period of pub-
lishing activity which brought him into
the centre of the literary world of the
time, the opportunity to travel widely,
and an enviable circle of literary friends
who provide a cast of stars for his
autobiography. The Sitwells, Isher-
wood, Auden, E. M. Forster, T. S.
Eliot (hard to think of him as “Tom”),
Spender, Lawrence Durrell, and many
more appear in his memories. And
their appearances are almost always
disappointing. Mr. Lehmann’s attitude
seems to rob them of vitality, and he
has remarkably little of interest to
say about any of them. His most
animated anecdotes are those which
tell of dinner parties, cocktail parties,
launching parties.
The attractions of the gay social round
of the literary entrepreneur prove
stronger than what he himself calls “the
more restricted and austere life of the
artist struggling in his own darkness.”
It would be impertinent to castigate
Mr. Lehmann for the choice that he
made, especially since it enabled him to
do so much that was worthwhile. It did
not, however, enable him to give to his
memoirs the depth and significance they
might otherwise have had.
The Song of the House
Blue gas-rings burning in the darkened kitchen.
As figures move in doorways, shadows cross
Rectangles of light flung on lawns. Floors creak.
My mother reads in bed, spectacles on nose,
(A brief glimpse through some double-glass paned doors)
And on a couch, lights on, my father dozes,
Hands clasped, face baked with red glaze of age,
Deeply inert features of fired porcelain.
My desk-lamp spotlights foliage, cricket songs wobble,
Air shifts through windows, barely perceptible,
And an autumn coolness prowls around the house.
This is a song of love for childhood’s house,
Galvanised roof crouched low beneath the night
Of bright stars flashing rapid messages,
Dim plankton of remoter galaxies,
Leaves of black glass and yellow juicy moons.

Painful
Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors—including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved —even with sufferers

Voodoo Men
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Invisibles. Francis Huxley. Hart-
Davis. $6.15.
Haiti is one of those places that
few people have been to but
whose name conjures up a vividly
instantaneous picture—voodoo, poverty,
political corruption, and the epauletted,
champagne - guzzling, bloody - minded
ghosts of Dessalines and Henri Chris-
tophe stalking through the vine-tangled
ruins of fantastic mountain palaces. “A
tropical flower springing from a dung-
hill of filth and superstition” was how
one 19th-century European traveller
described Haiti, the black republic
occupying one end of the Caribbean
island of San Domingo, the old His-
paniola of the Spanish Main.
It does not appear from more recent
books that things have changed much
in the past hundred years. An expen-
sive hotel rears itself out of the pic-
turesque squalor of Port-au-Prince.
Libations of coca-cola and bourbon
as well as the traditional rum are
poured round the voodoo altars. A
few hardy tourists peek and photograph
in the more accessible corners. But
President Duvalier still rules in the
spirit of Dessalines, and, through the
whole of Haitian life, flows the dark
subterranean river of voodoo—the most
mysterious and bizarre religion on the
face of the earth.
Francis Huxley, author of “The
Invisibles,” belongs to the famous
Huxley clan, the son of Julian and a
nephew of Aldous. After working in
a mental hospital in Canada he went
to Haiti, financed by the Parapsycho-
logical Foundation of New York, “to
Tsee whether voodoo had its own way
of coping with insanity.” His investi-
gations, however, soon broadened and
the result is a fascinating, almost in-
credible, account of voodoo rituals and
the hideously complicated farrago of
pagan African myths and a sort of
surrealist parody of Christianity that
makes up the voodoo theology.
Huxley must be a man of remark-
able personality, for voodoo adepts
are usually deeply suspicious of any
blanc who tries to pry into their
secrets. But Huxley, treating them
seriously and without a hint of patron-
age, was accepted as a fellow scien-
tiste, a seeker after truth. He became
the friend and confidant of houngans
and mambos (priests and priestesses).
There are two religions in Haiti,
says Huxley the conventional and
passive represented by the Catholic
Church, to which most of the inhabi-
tants pay lip service, and the active
and familial belief in voodoo which
saturates their lives from birth to death.
To the Haitian Catholic priest voodoo
is simply the work of the devil, but
every attempt by the Church to break
the authority of the houngans has
failed completely. Voodoo has taken
over Catholic prayers and ritual,
Catholic saints have been incorporated
in the voodoo pantheon, and in the
temples their brightly painted plaster
images stand side by side with those
of terrifying gods brought from West
African jungles in the slave ships of
the past.
JJAITIANS go straight from Mass
to the cemetery to worship Baron
Samedi, the god of the dead. Politicians
who are pillars of the Church keep pri-
vate voodoo temples on their country
estates and sleep with mad women to
improve their chances of election. “The
houngans have women everywhere, they
buy themselves cars and eat up the
country like goats,” one Catholic
priest told Huxley bitterly. Houngans
encourage the belief in zombies (walk-
ing corpses- from which the soul has
been stolen by magic), they must be
bribed or placated before any under-
taking can succeed, they are the
repositories of all the mysterious powers
of nature concealed in every herb and
plant.
Huxley sometimes wonders, and the
reader will wonder, too, just how seri-
ously the more intelligent Haitians take
the mumbo-jumbo of voodoo. The
whirling, noisy, incantatory rituals of
voodoo, with their drinking, dancing,
and sexual overtones, offer Haitians an
escape from the brutal realities of their
daily existence. Voodoo is the grand
cathartic.
WATER COLOR
The cleaner at the door is a blue mark in the rain,
A blue dab in the wet red of the convent wall.
The drenched hides of the horses, the riders’ faces
(Purged and flushed, coming easily back from the Common)
Glow with suave tints and suffer with patience
The chilling store-light attacking them, a bleached
Fluorescence. These colors meet but can’t merge,
The air resignedly includes the opposites:
Such disparate quantities make the place real,
Real enough for my petty challenges.
Only my ungainly stance and grey look
In a no-colored raincoat are out of place.

Rome! It's not unnatural that AIR-INDIA jets
should be seen there so often. There are two
reasons. People like to see Rome . . and they
like to fly AIR-INDIA at least we conclude
that they do because of our increasingly
frequent flights, not only into Rome but other
places too like Paris, London, New York,
Tokyo, Moscow, 27 cities in 22 countries.
Perhaps it is our particularly high reputa-
tion for 'dependability, our multi-million-
mile pilots, or our superb international
cuisine. Certainly our elegant hostesses in
silk saris are quite unique. Probably it’s a
combination of all these that makes what
passengers call the “AIR-INDIA DIFFERENCE”.

AS W. H. AUDEN points out in
his introduction to the “Oxford
Book of Light Verse,” light verse
is only possible when the poet has a
secure place in society and when there
is an intimate relationship between him-
self and his audience. Light verse has
declined both in practice and in repu-
tation. It is certainly notable that now
when poets feel like writing in less
serious and demanding forms they
usually take to writing poems for
children (Eliot, Ted Hughes, Robert
Craves, Judith Wright) rather than
light verse in the social sense. Poets
need a defined and responsive audience,
however small, and there is not much
of a public these days among so-called
serious poetry readers for verse that is
light in nature. The conditions
required for its production no longer
exist. It is significant, however, that
such light verse as appears has and
probably can have only one subject
sex.
Q-AVIN EWART is one of the few
serious modern writers of light
verse and his “Pleasures of the Flesh”
is the funniest book of verse I have read
for years. Full of highly unsavory jokes
and some poems in very bad taste, it is
outstanding for its modern bestiary,

Ewart’s world is the modern world
of the adman, of the business office
with its cramped lusts and frustra-
tions. He has the novelist’s eye for
memorable quirks of speech and
gesture as his series “A Handful of
People” and its portraits of Sandra,
lan, and Ursula shows. Notable, too,
are his savage little critical poems
(poets attacking the critics again) and
his brilliant variations on themes. The
variation on a theme of K. Amis is
a particularly unkind assault on a
known English poetess:
Perhaps words come to women too
easily,
Pouring out regardless like coffee or
tea,
Or like the uncritical fountains in
Renaissance palaces?
Nobody values what is given away free.
Mr. Ewart is not all outrageous puns

and giggles and tickles: there are
serious poems about Freud and the
modern world; some bitter personal
pieces about second-rate purpose and
mediocre success, and unselfpitying
poems about failure without any note
of sly self-congratulation tucked away
inside them. But Mr. Ewart is at his
best when he is light.
The typographically highlighted and
asserted ALL in the title of Louis
Zukofsky’s book is, of course, some-
thing in the nature of a private,
coterie joke. His collected short poems
is a remarkably short book, indeed,
though Zukofsky would doubtless
argue that he has always aimed at
concentration rather than expansion.
Zukofsky was one of the Objectivists’
leading theorists and his art seems to
have developed out of the imagism of
the early Pound and William Carlos
Williams. Like Williams, though with-
out Williams’ innate feeling for design
and color, Zukofsky can bring off a
clear imagist poem with considerable
success.
Like most of the Imagists, Zukofsky,
in spite of his social conscience, is
plagued by an ennervating triviality.
But there are real if small successes
throughout - most notably the poem
addressed to his washstand, which has
the unexpectedness of a Duchamp
painting.
F Zukofsky is primarily a poet for
the aesthete, Karen Gershon is a
writer for whom poetry is a means of
expressing protest and provoking com-
passion. Mrs. Gershon’s poems form an
autobiographical whole and her life
reflects the tragic destiny of a people.
A Jewish poet, she records various per-
sonal incidents—her childhood, details
of her parents’ lives and their sufferings;
torture and death of relatives and
friends in the concentration camps; her
life and thoughts as a refugee and her
constant inner fight against tht nega-
tions of bitterness and hatred to find a
renewed sense of continuity and the
possibilities of affirmation. All this is
expressed through a series of simple,
unpunctuated poems, many with a
ballad-like rhythm and intensity. This
is a deeply moving book.
Peter Whigham’s rendering of
Catullus’ poems is a most welcome
addition to Penguin’s valuable series
of translations of the classics. The
diction of these adaptations owes much
to William Carlos Williams debt
that Mr. Whigham proudly acknow-
ledges and they are all American-
ised and therefore Frenchified and
heavily Pounded, too. Mr. Whigham is
bang up to date in his adapted refer-
ences: Broadway makes several appear-
ances; Irish-American names play an
important role. All this is probably
appalling to purists and specialists; but
they don’t need translations, anyway;
and Mr. Whigham’s diction seems fully
appropriate to his purpose.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Fuzzy Thinking
THE Government is making a mess of New Guinea’s
economic development. All the protestations that it
is only doing (with a few changes) what the World
Bank suggested, following its 1963 visit to the area, does
not change the fact that the policy has been a flop. It
should be changed immediately, and next month’s “follow-
up” visit by a mission from the World Bank would be
an excellent opportunity to point out to that well-intentioned
organisation that it has made a mistake.
For the World Bank’s philosophy (which suited the poli-
tical attitudes of the Federal Government, if not the prac-
tical requirements of the Administration) was that the
economic development of the area should be undertaken
mainly by private enterprise, and that the role of the
Government should be to create a suitable environment in
which this private enterprise could flourish. Not only do
the Government and the World Bank expect private enter-
prise to provide the initial, all-important lift to primary
production, but they expect this leading role to be provided
by outside entrepreneurs, by non-indigenous people who
are prepared to risk their capital in the area. As a philo-
sophical concept in an ideal world, that is good stuff;
as a guide to developing a primitive country whose pros-
perity will depend on uncertain world markets for primary
commodities, it is a load of nonsense. It has not worked
in the past three years and it won’t work in the future.
The evidence of its failure so far is given clearly in
a recent Current Affairs Bulletin of the Adult Education
Department of Sydney University. Apart from tea, which
is still in its very early stages of development, recent
figures for new areas planted to crops by non-indigenous
rural enterprise show a downward trend since the 1961-62
peak. There was some recovery in 1965, but for the four
main crops (coconut, cocoa, coffee, and rubber) new plant-
ing figures are all lower than in 1960. “The best that can
be said so far,” says the CAB, “is that the large-scale
new investment hoped for in the plantation sector does not
yet show in the limited statistics available.”
The reasons are not hard to find. Apart from the political
uncertainties, which must always cloud investment in such
areas, the fact remains that there is an unnaturally high
degree of risk involved in the prices for the products to
be grown and processed. For example, despite a substantial
increase in rubber production since 1961, rubber earnings,
have remained virtually constant because of lower prices.
And for cocoa the situation was even worse when last year’s
price fall clipped its export earnings nearly back to the
1961 level, despite a trebling of production in that period.
The recent price history of agricultural commodities is not
one that would encourage many company directors to invest
large sums in them. Given a combination of uncertain
returns and an uncertain political future, it is quite absurd
to expect private enterprise to jump nobly into the develop-
ment breech. The facts are that it is the Government that
is at risk in this area, and it is the Government that should
be assuming that risk in an economic sense.

MEN AND MATTERS
THERE was a time some forty years
ago when the words “bunchy top”
were on the lips of all Queensland
banana growers and half the bush
politicians in Australia. That they are
so no longer is due to Charles Joseph
Patrick Magee, who retired recently
from the New South Wales Department
of Agriculture.
Back in the 19205, when plant
pathology and especially plant virology
were largely uncharted fields of know-
ledge, he elucidated the nature of
bunchy top disease of bananas. By so
doing he gave Australia a stable and
productive industry. When being
awarded the rare distinction of Doctor
of Agricultural Science in 1938 it was
entered in his citation that “ ... it is
given to few men to make possible the
addition of over half a million pounds
annually to the production from the
land in any country.”
Born on November 17, 1901, at Lis-
more, Magee gave the Department all
46 years of his professional life, the
last nine being spent in the highly
responsible post of Chief of the Divi-
sion of Science Services. Noted first as
a scholar, he quickly achieved world
recognition for his authoritative work
on banana diseases.
His expert knowledge has been called
upon often by overseas governments,
including those of the U.K. and the
U.S.A., and the
Food and Agricul-
ture Organisation of
the United Nations.
In this connection
he has visited
Egypt, Ceylon, Fiji,
New Guinea, and
Samoa to advise on
banana diseases. He
has travelled to the
Philippines, North
Borneo, and Malaya
to study and report
on manila hemp
disease. As an administrator of scien-
tists he won respect and will be kindly
remembered by them. This also is a
fairly unusual feat.
THE Minister for External Affairs,
Mr. Paul Hasluck, may well have
gone to Djakarta on Australia
Day to open the new Embassy and
later to hold foreign policy discus-
sions. But it seemed fairly evident that
the composition of his official party
was heavily weighted toward trade.
Of the value of this in the light of
future relations with Indonesia there
can be no doubt. And full agreement
comes from Mr. Geoffrey Antony
Hawley, the 53-year-old Commissioner
of the Export Payments Insurance
Corporation, who returned quite ex-

cited by a range of talks and confer-
ences which embraced trade-orientated
politicians, civil servants, academics,
and the übiquitous chamber of com-
merce.
Mr. Hawley confidently maintains
that Indonesia is set to achieve politi-
cal stability sooner than many observers
predict. EPIC is getting ready, as well,
to provide expertise and insurance pro-
tection for local exporters.
A proper judgment of foreign trade
and exchange matters should come
easily to Mr. Hawley. He went straight
from the Perth Modern School into the
Commonwealth Bank. Mr. Hawley was
superintendent of exchange control,
Sydney, when the Federal Government
invited him to become EPIC’s Commis-
sioner in 1959.


number of projects that might qualify for loans from the
Bank or from its International Development Association
(which carry only a small service charge against the World
Bank’s six to seven percent). No doubt there will be some
agricultural developments (meat and timber) that might
attract it to financing non-indigenous entrepreneurs. But
the greatest scope for Europeans appears to be in develop-
ing light secondary industries to service local needs or in
processing local products one step further. In most of the
areas of export potential, indigenous effort seems called
for. As the CAB so properly points out, the remarkable
scope for development of the indigenous, subsistence agri-
culture is not recognised in the brave new world of the
World Bank and Mr. Barnes.
The CAB regards as “misguided” the view that subsis-
tence agriculture is an unfortunate legacy of the past that
should be eliminated. It says there is still considerable scope
for the application of relatively simple and cheap techno-
logical improvements in subsistence production that would
economise further in labor and land, thus increasing the
surplus available to other productive uses. “This factor
will become increasingly important as pressure of popula-
tion on resources, particularly on land resources, extends
with the expansion of cash cropping among subsistence
agriculturalists.”
And to underline the potential for increases in indigenous
activity, the natives have multiplied their coffee production
five times in the past four years to exceed by 20 percent
the output of the “plantation sector,” which in 1961 had
been times bigger than that of the indigenous sector.
The 28 percent increase over four years in indigenous
output of coconut is four times the rate of increase in the
plantation sector.
Native enterprise
But unless the Government takes a protective trading
position (through some sort of price equalisation scheme),
so that the natives feel they are not wasting their time,
this far more worthwhile concept of developing native
enterprise may founder on the rocks of fluctuating com-
modity prices. It should also be spending far more time
in organising and financing co-operative growers’ opera-
tions; the costs would not be high relative to what it is
already spending there.
The Government has been spending increasing sums on
the area in recent years, and its annual contribution is now
up near the $lOO million mark; a very large sum when
related to the 2.2 million people in the area. But since the
1963 World Bank visit, the spending emphasis has been
on medium- and long-term measures for developing the
“infrastructure” rather than on short-term commodity
producing projects (the proceeds of which may have helped
pay for the “infrastructure” items later on). In any event,
the effect of this has been to increase the area’s dependence
on cash support from Australia, because the policy of leaving
agricultural development to private enterprise simply has
not really begun to work. And the size of the investment
needed from private enterprise is very large indeed.
The need of the private investor is not only for adequate
loan funds, it is for some sort of guarantees of political
stability and adequate profits. And the absence of guaran-
tees ori politics and commodity prices would mean that
normal commercial enterprises would simply have to aim
at very high profits as an offsetting factor. Any Australian
public company director who did not take that view could
expect a torrid time from his shareholders. It is clear
that the proper governmental policy for this area is not
one of simply creating the right atmosphere for development;
it must also play a sensible part itself, particularly in acting
as a leader, organiser of finance, and agent for indigenous
commodity growers. This should hot in any way limit
the scope for private endeavor, but rather increase it by
making the area a reliable economic unit. New Guinea
needs balanced development. It is not getting it.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: Interest rates on a new
Commonwealth loan (the third in the 1966-67 year)
are fully in accord with wider trends toward cheaper
money, especially on the “shorts.” The three-year cur-
rency bears a coupon percent, issued at $99.75 to
yield 4.59 percent; 10-, 21-, and 34-year currencies are
all issued at par and the respective coupons are 5, SJ,
and 5J percent. The Treasurer has departed from the
usual practice of fixing a nominal target, since this
“had ceased to serve any practical purpose.”
Industry’s new capital expenditure in the September
quarter reached $434.6m, against $435.8m for the corres-
ponding period of 1965 and $461.6m in the July, 1966,
quarter.
Australia became 1 a net exporter of steel during the
five months ended November, these exports having
doubled and imports fallen by over 40 percent . . .
Exports of mineral sands are now more than s2om a
year and totalled just above s27m in 1965.
For the markets: Industrials began to look a
little better at the close on Australian share markets,
although, strongly abetted by BHP, the all-ordinaries
index dropped back. Dealings are not particularly
heavy; minerals and oils remain under some suspicion.
Government bonds are proving a highlight in London,
which also showed improvement among steels, engineer-
ing, and building issues . . . Not even profit-taking could
reverse Wall Street, whose vigor has puzzled some
analysts.
For companies: With many eyes focused on
the Marlin C-l well’s production tests, the best Esso-
BHP could do was to confirm “a substantial gas reserve
in the Marlin field” and point to a need for further
analysis to determine the oil potential. “The area is
geologically complicated,” the report mentioned.
Elsewhere, extractors were led by Mount Morgan,
which duly proclaimed a “substantially increased” profit
and doubled interim dividend to 10 cents a $ share,
suggesting a 20 percent annual rate . . . Mount Lyell
yielded bigger outputs of both copper and silver, and
slightly less gold, in the half-year to December ... A
purchase of 259,000 Renison shares gave Consolidated
Gold Fields (Australia) a further 8 percent of Renison’s
capital; CGA paid $7.50 a share . . . E.Z. Industries
has received an 87 percent ordinary capital acceptance
of its offer to Emu Bay Railway . . . Freeport of Aust.
Inc. is joining Metals Exploration in further testing
of Greenvale (northern Queensland) nickel.
Aluminium ascendant seems the goal of Comalco
Industries (the joint C.R.A.-Kaiser aluminium group),
for profits leapt 65 percent in 1966, to $5,916,574; a
$2.4m dividend equals 8 percent. Chairman Sir Maurice
Mawby felt it was “not the best of years.”
The hire-purchase dovecote fluttered when Commer-
cial and General Acceptance (CAGA) had to report
lower earnings for the December six months on
“virtually steady” business . . . Lombard Australia
restored the balance by a 19.8 percent profit advance,
to $649,255, for 1966; receivables went ahead by
sB.sm . . . Adelaide financier Lensworth showed a small
rise for 1966-67’s first half.
Cigarette maker Philip Morris struck heightened
demand once again and sent earnings up 31.5 percent,
to $1,254,234, in the December six months . . . Queens-
land United Foods also experiences higher turnover and
profits.
Boilermaker International Combustion lifted earning
rate to 38.7 percent (previously 37.3 percent) in its
year to September, well covering a 20 percent dividend
. . . Steel and aluminium distributor William Atkins had
a slower December half-year . . . Office equipment
maker Lamson Industries is sending dividend from 9
to 10 percent on profit up from $745,765 to $835,785.

Spartan Thoughts from Somers
By CROESUS
UP in Lygon Street maybe they
won’t be all that interested, but
this year, searching for summer
relief from teenage sub-culture in Vic-
toria, this column thoughtfully eschewed
the delectable watering-places like
Lome favored by “Batman,” and
plumped for the more spartan shores
of Westernport. Here is the scene of
the annual Lord Somers’ Camp, whose
original motive was to get youths on
either side of the industrial fence
acquainted for the future betterment of
industrial relations.
Thanks to full employment and its
accompanying winds of social change
which have, as the saying goes,
emancipated the masses since the late
Lord Somers, when Governor of Vic-
toria, presided over the first of his
camps down there in 1931 (the two
previous years’ camps, one of which
I attended, were held at Anglesea, in
lush “Batman” territory), the gulf
between the two sides of industry has
narrowed appreciably. It would be
pleasing to think that the thousands
of lads from schools and factories
who’ve passed through the camps over
the years contributed to the process
by carrying the message of industrial
co-operation into their workplaces.
Yes, but it would be idle to pretend
that employers (including the Govern-
ment) and trade unionists behave like
turtle doves toward each other in Vic-
toria, a State where Labor, both indus-
trial and political, prides itself on its
militancy and, as Mr. Calwell put it
recently, scorns “tame-cat” unionists
who prefer summer picnics to demon-
strations for his self-chosen Labor
causes.
Nor, to be realistic, can it necessarily
be assumed that for all their worthy
economic and social intentions, the
sponsors, organisers, and voluntary
workers of Somers Camp will ulti-
mately break through the hard crust
of Labor militancy in Victoria. This
has become more obvious in recent
years because, with the decline of Labor
as a political force, the industrial arm
has been stiffened, putting co-operation
with employers at a discount and
militancy at a premium.
Industry, as well as the general pub-
lic, has to live with these impenetrable
attitudes and has learned to treat
them as part of the set piece, taking
strikes as they come, philosophically,
as necessary evils in a world moving
toward better things where progressive
ideas will ultimately prevail. So let us
have more and bigger camps at Somers
in the hope that one fine day the hard
crust of labor will be broken by the
sheer weight of enlightened workers!
I was also reflecting at Somers on
a couple of other related labor sub-
jects. One was that some of the big-
gest firms in the country are more
firmly grasping the nettle of human
resources and their understanding.
This area overlaps that of Somers
Camp in that it is obvious that, say
in the case of Sir Colin Syme’s new
concentration on the problem of human
resources at BHP, he will be thinking
as much about employees’ attitudes
toward the company as of the com-
pany’s satisfaction with employees,
with BHP workers scattered over the
face of Australia, a high proportion
of them migrants and overall occupy-
ing practically every job in the book.
BHP’s problem of having a head
office in one capital city and subsidi-
aries operating in other States is
duplicated hundreds of times in Aus-
tralia. But I often wonder how deep is
the understanding by all these head
offices of the problems facing those
involved in operations in other States.
Even allowing for a high degree of
decentralisation of control in inter-
state operations, day-to-day contact by
telephone or teleprinter involves both
sides of the operation in situations
requiring delicate understanding. It is
not so much that the man in Perth
may be still in bed when Sydney rings
him first thing in its morning or that
he might be out at lunch at the proper
Perth time, but rather that he .might,
say, be on the golf course when by
rights he should be at his office.
rpo take another aspect, migrants’
problems also call for deep and
sympathetic understanding. BHP has
run into a lot of awkward situations in
this area, particularly at Whyalla,
where making “steel in the sun” on
the bare shores of Spencer’s Gulf has
often, too often, proved to be a dif-
ferent proposition on the spot than
from a survey of the scene in a
brochure on a bleak day in South
Wales or Glasgow. BHP has gone to
extraordinary expedients to keep mig-
rant workers in Whyalla, but, at least
when I was there some time ago, its
labor turnover was shattering, and
highly costly to the company. Perhaps
Sir Colin will be looking for some new
answers to this as well as to a number
of other problems in the employment
of migrants. Somebody should make
a national study of the matter.
Finally, browsing over a newspaper
full of names of successful matricula-
tion students one hot morning as a
BP tanker crawled up the port to the
new refinery reminded me of some-
thing Sir Archibald Glenn, the Chan-
cellor of La Trobe University, and, of
course, chairman of ICIANZ, said to
me at the Reserve Bank’s Christmas
party in Melbourne, on the attitudes
of modern youjh standing in the wings
of the employment stage. It was to*
the effect that many young people think
that industry will be lucky to get them,
rather than the other way round. BPIP’s
new managing director, Sir lan Mc-
Lennan, was within earshot of this
remark. Apropos of the boys of Somers
Camp, it occurred to me how times
had changed since the early ’thirties.
These two outsanding industrial lead-
ers happened to be brilliant student
contemporaries of mine in those days
and I happen to know that both were
greatly relieved to find employment
when their university days were done.
It was not a question of “come and
get me,” as it apparently is nowadays.


WILD CAT
PAGES
Behind the Stramit Board
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By PELIAS in Melbourne
STRAMIT is either doing extremely
well in the current year or its
directors have made a sharp
about-turn in their policies for the
group. The board has announced a
premium share placement which will
lift paid capital by more than 20
percent. The total $388,000-odd raised
\\*dl be used for expansion and to
develop and finance “important new
products.” The move appears to be
out of line with the stated policies set
out in black and white by the board
in the 1965-66 annual report. These
indicated a plan to grow slowly but
surely and to maintain the already high
earning rate.
The emphasis then was on “con-
servative financial policy” and a
“steady build-up of financial stability
. . . rather than any spectacular
changes.” Any capital moves would be
“conservatively calculated, with the
main emphasis on the adequate safe-
guarding of shareholders’ interests
and the company’s finances.” This
view of things would require consider-
able stretching if it was to embrace a
20 percent capital increase without
resort to shareholders and the intro-
duction of new and presumably un-
proved products to the company’s
range.
Yet, in view of the binding nature of
the statements made by the board in
their annual report and the excellent
record the group has established since
listing, it is just as hard to believe that
the directors are going back on their
word. So, if one is to assume that their
move is conservative, then it follows
that Stramit must be doing extremely
well in the current year. This makes
the 50 cent shares excellent buying at
their current price of $l, yielding a
high 6.2 percent from the dividend.
Although the share placement must
take some attraction out of the shares
for the short term, it enhances their
medium- and long-term outlook. If
directors are aiming to maintain earn-
ing rate at its present 30 percent level,
then the placement must be considered
a wise move. They could not have
hoped to maintain earnings if the same
amount of money was raised through
shareholders. The placement was made
at 97 cents a share, much too close to
the market price to attract anyone but
an institutional investor.
The move into new products is not
necessarily a cause for apprehension,
either. Additions made to the range
over the past few years have all proved
successful; there is no reason why the
latest should not follow suit. Directors
have assured that the new products
will greatly widen the scope of activi-
ties and add to profits. It is also a fact
that the company must diversify to
maintain its growth—its present pro-
ducts are sold through branches in all
States except W.A., so their growth
potential would be limited compared
to that of a new product.
The acceptance of a large parcel of
shares by financial institutions is the
final proof that Stramit has emerged
as a company which is highly success-
ful and well established in its sector
of the building industry (turnover w T as
$5 million in 1965-66).
THERE has been gathering support
for Draff in Everhot shares over the
past few weeks and the $1 units
have edged up from below $1.30 to
$1.42. They seem sensible buying at
this stage, especially as the dividend
yield is seven percent this leaves
plenty of room for improvement. The
company makes ten percent annual
payouts in one final amount and there
is no danger of the rate being reduced
this year. In the year to March 31,
1966, the payout was covered more
than twice by the slightly lower 23.9
percent earnings.
Despite the guarded tone of the
interim report, the group should stage
a mild recovery this year. There is
some resurgence of demand for the
company’s products in country areas,
although it is not expected to reach
pre-drought levels until the end of
this calendar year. Management has
been improving production and distri-
bution methods in a general effort to
hold costs down and increase efficiency.
Their efforts were rewarded in the
September half, when a slightly higher
profit was made despite lower turnover.
Thus, there seems little doubt that
profits will rise this year. The result
and the dividend for the year is usu-
ally announced early in July. Finan-
cially, the company is solid and there
seems little reason why the shares
should not rise between now and then.
The Chartist says:
ASSOCIATED FRENEY N.L. 80c paid appears very promising technically
for a substantial rise. The chart, reproduced back to 1961, shows a break
in trend during the early months of 1964, which was followed by a steep
decline, and a low point of 6c was finally recorded in March, 1966. A rise to
25c followed the general upward movement of oil stocks about the middle of
last year and further consolidation has taken place above the 12c level. This
stock could be safely bought once the 25c resistance level is broken; the upward
movement to 21c on very heavy volume during the past week suggests that an
uptrend could be expected to commence very shortly, with a potential first target
of approximately 40c. There is a further target of about 65c and an even more
optimistic objective between $1 and $l.lO for the longer term. The overall
picture could be classified as a base head and shoulders reversal pattern. Last
sale price on 2/2/67 —19 c.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
While ■many good industrials looked more stable at the close,
most of the sectional indexes went mildly down over the week.
The markets did not particularly relish the Marlin C-l report,
so 24 cents in all were taken from BHP, bringing it to $6.36.
Philip Morris, of course, gave great delight and was pushed
up 50 cents to $7.60. Dunlop’s interim finally meant a 6 cent
addition on the week, the shares closing at $1.40. Among
financiers, CAGA, at $1.35, was brought back 13 cents. Miners
are still uneven: Mount Isa dropped 9 cents and Western
Mining 18 cents.

Le tourneau-westinghoiise
Australian Blue Metal’s quarry at Gosnells, W.A.,
operates two LW27 and two LW32 Haulpak Rear

all tough handling conditions. Built-in safety
features include four independent braking sys-
tems and a strong proven power steering system
throughout. Big, efficient heavy-duty service

braking power to stop quickly and safely under
full load. Result: operator will use higher travel
speeds with complete confidence . . . move more
tons per shift.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Little Growth for APPM
ACCORDING to the 1966 annual
report, Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills Limited produces fine
papers, magazine papers, coated papers
and boards, special wrappings, hard-
board, flakeboard, and sawn timber. In
each group there are a number of
different products listed. For example,
“special wrappings” consists of vege-
table parchment, greaseproof paper,
glassine paper, superglaze, and glazed
imitation parchment. So, although the
APPM group is probably regarded as
being in the main a producer of fine
writing paper, it is clear that this
description is an over-simplification.
The principal statistics are :

A word is necessary about some of
these statistics. Adjustments have been
made to the series for earnings, divi-
dends and prices per share to take into
account any new or bonus issues. The
basis of adjustment is similar to that
used in the calculation of the Sydney
Stock Exchange share price index and,
by and large, it is assumed that when
a rights issue is made sufficient of the
rights entitlement are sold to take up
the balance. The “share price” is then
the price exactly midway between the
high and low prices for the year. Asset
backing, proprietorship ratio, and cur-
rent ratio are calculated in the normal
fashion and no adjustments are made.
However, in all cases, adjustments may
have been made to the published figures
appearing either in the profit and loss
accounts or the balance sheets, where
it is felt that they are necessary in the
interests of preserving uniformity be-
tween the accounts of various other
companies.
Generally, these statistics do not give
a great deal of confidence in the pros-
pects of future growth and it is perhaps
not very surprising to find that the
share price has again subsided to below
$1.30. At this level, the dividend yield
would be 7.3 percent and the earnings
yield 10.9 percent, but this would be
based on the assumption that the
1965/66 earnings and dividends would
be maintained in 1966/67. The latest
interim report certainly throws some
doubt on the maintenance of the earn-
ing rate, for the profit for the first
half of 1966/67 was only 47 percent of
the profit in the first half of 1965/66.
If earnings in the second half of 1966/67
are exactly the same as in the second
half of 1965/66, then earnings per share
will be down by about 34 percent, so
the current earnings yield is probably
only 7.3 percent.
The interim dividend was reduced
from 4.5 cents per share to 4.0 cents
per share. This might well mean that
the full year’s dividend will not be more
than 9.0 cents, i.e., the present dividend
yield is 6.9 percent.
We are fortunate to have quite a fair
amount of published information both
from the annual reports and chairman’s
addresses of APPM and from other
publications of a more general nature.
The market for fine paper, which
includes writings, printeds, and coateds,
but not wrapping paper, appears to
have been increasing at an annual rate
of about 7 percent per annum as a
result of a 4J percent per capita
increase and a 2J percent population
increase. Unfortunately, this increase has
occurred to a large extent in the past
two years. It is as yet too early (in
my view) to say how much of this
increase is non-recurring, in that it was
due to the changeover to decimal cur-
rency. At one time, some informed
people were saying that demand was
running 30 percent higher due to this
factor.
Over the past five years, supplies of
writings, printeds, and coateds to the
local market have increased by about
percent, but there was a sharp drop
in 1961/62. The following table shows
the various sources of these supplies:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
'OOO tons
APPM 43 5 58 9 60 0 63 0 76.1

A PM 2.935415342
Total 73.8 101 0 99 1 112 3 134 0
In percentage terms these figures
become:
APPM 59 58 60 56 57
Shoalhaven 11 11 12 18 19
Imports 26 27 23 21 21
These figures suggest that APPM is
just managing to hold its share of the
local market. It would be difficult to
suggest that it is in a very strong posi-
tion to increase that share.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to
reconcile APPM’s own figures with
those given above. According to the
annual reports and chairman’s
addresses, APPM’s total sales of paper
outside the group have been as under,
and, after deducting the sales of wrap-
ping papers, sales of other papers would
appear to be rather higher than those
which appear in the table above.
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Total sales, 'OOO tons 61.7 81.0 87.2 97.3 105 0

Difference 56 3 74 0 79.2 88.1 $6.8
Supplies locally 43 5 58.9 60.0 63.0 76.1
Some of the difference would be
explained by exports, which exceeded
10,600 tons in 1965/66.
So far as prices are concerned, it
seems that the average price of special
wrapping paper may have increased
fractionally, but the price of coateds
seems to have been declining over the
whole period. The price of “fine
paper” might have increased by about
seven percent over the five-year period.
In any event, it seems unlikely that
price increases have kept pace with
increasing costs of labor and the major
raw material, pulp.
Sales of Burnieboard and sawn
timber and logs have increased quite
well over the five-year period; in

1958 be dismissed. If you wish to defend

1965/66, they represented in value
terms 23.6 percent of total sales as
compared with 20 percent in 1962/63
(the 1961/62 year was a particularly
poor year for paper sales and in that
year Burnieboard and timber repre-
sented 24.3 percent of total sales).
Now that a joint company has been
formed with CSR, it is likely that, in
future, APPM’s income from this
activity will take the form of dividends.
A positive relationship, based on
profit and loss account figures, between
sales and expenses can only be calcu-
lated for the past three years. The
percentage of “wages, materials, and
other expenses” to sales would seem to
be 80 percent (1963/64), 82.7 percent
(1964/65), and 81 percent (1965/66).
The chairman devoted some con-
siderable part of his 1966 address to
the effect of increased wage costs
which had necessitated price increases
in several of the company’s products.
Reference was also made to increased
costs of capital and the uncertainty
which existed in the future pricing of
imported pulp, which was a major
raw material for APPM.
The best guess that one could make
about the trend in expenses would be
that, in the short term, the percentage
to total sales is unlikely to increase.
This can only be regarded as a wild
guess, because paper - making is a
capital intensive activity today and a
fall in production, as seems to have
occurred in the first part of 1966/67,
means that fixed costs have to be
absorbed over a smaller volume.
Depreciation is quite a major cost
in APPM’s accounts and to some
extent the size of this provision in
1966/67 is going to have quite a
material effect on earnings per share.
In view of this and because of the
change in the “location” of the hard-
board activity, estimates are a little
hazardous. Nevertheless, I doubt
whether per share earnings can exceed
11 cents in 1966/67 and I don’t think
that they will be less than nine cents.
The most probable figure in my view
is about ten cents (not just because
it happens to be the mid-point between
the two extremes). At $1.30, the shares
are selling at 13 times expected earn-
ings and it does seem that the dividend
yield is only 6.9 percent in all proba-
bility, unless there is a spectacular
improvement in the second half, ,

Emphasis on Titanium
THE U.S. Government has aggin
underlined the importance it
places on titanium with the latest
plans to ensure supplies. A lift in mili-
tary stockpile objectives has been fol-
lowed by a move to increase domestic
production. Output of rutile, the main
ore, is to be raised from 5000 to 75,000
short tons a year.
Last year, the U.S. imported about
170,000 tons of rutile, virtually all
from Australia. However, demand for
titanium is soaring and shows every
sign of speeding up in coming years.
A spokesman for local beach sands
miner Mineral Deposits Pty. Ltd.,
which is 80 percent owned by National
Lead, the top U.S. titanium producer,
recently said the metal’s U.S. pro-
duction would probably double by
1970. The company was already pre-
paring to meet extra orders which will
follow completion of titanium-produc-
tion expansion for which the U.S.
Government has granted a priority
order. U.S. titanium production last
year was 13,500 short tons.
Another local producer, Murphy
Ores, recently stated that titanium con-
sumption by 1970, basically for the
U.S. market, would be 50 million lbs.
25,000 short tons. The metal is only
part of the growth picture, for rutile
is increasingly preferred to ilmenite
for pigment production.
One of the main bases for these
estimates of a rapid growth is the
development of supersonic aircraft.
Airframe, skin, and many engine com-
ponents of these aircraft will be
titanium. And, as pointed out in THE
BULLETIN, the technological advan-
ces brought about in study of use of
this unusual metal have been des-
cribed as revolutionary by “The
Economist,” which says that they have
“thrown a long shadow over the world
of metal machining.”
This background provides a perspec-
tive for the plans to boost U.S. rutile
production. Not that production will
be so easy to boost. Pittsburgh Plate
Glass, in concert with a U.K. group,
went to Sierra Leone to meet its needs
for the metal. (Incidentally, the devel-
opment last year of this 100,000-tons-a-
-year source has not troubled the
established producers.)
National Lead, as mentioned, obtains
its supplies in Australia. And the
150,000-ton lift in the “conventional
war objective” for U.S. stocks of rutile
would soak up two years’ supply of
this new source, at full capacity. All
this means that it would be unwise to
assume that rutile demand or prices
will fall in the foreseeable future.
COCOA prices continue to hold up
well in London despite more
J reports of declining chocolate
consumption. (West Germany and
Britain followed the recent U.S. report.)
The consumption falls, mostly on quar-
terly figures, are probably short-term
setbacks, and the outlook is still for a
long-run deficit.
But locally based producers must
balance their cocoa gains against copra
losses all grow the two. Prices for
copra, the coconut kernel, have been at
abysmally low levels for over a year,
and show no sign of rising.
THE copper scene has been stable,
though hardly calm, lately. The
main development has been a
move to refer to an international tri-
bunal the Congo Government’s dispute
with the Belgian-owned mine—Union
Miniere. This would probably mean
several months of quiet on that front.

MAN ON THE LAND
Killen and the Wool Trade
OF all the plans for the marketing
of wool (and there have been at
least a dozen), none has created
such a furore as the Killen proposal
for an appraisement-acquisition-pools
system. Yet already this plan, in our
opinion, is a non-goer. It is a series of
suggestions, on paper, and seems un-
likely to amount to anything more than
that.
The plan has not got the support
that Mr. Killen (and others) hope for.
The death knock is contained, we would
say, in the resolution passed by the
executive of the Australian Wool and
Meat Producers’ Federation. This body
“noted with interest” the plan, the
chairman congratulated Mr. Killen per-
sonally, and then the rider was added
that the Federation executive did not
endorse it.
The Federation has a plan, or plans,
of its own, and apparently needs no
help from Mr. Killen. This does not
mean it could not borrow ideas from
the Killen plan, and no one could main-
tain that the plan is bereft of ideas. The
wool industry does need ideas, so this is
how the plan should be judged. The
charge by the Committee for the Reten-
tion and Improvement of the Free Wool
Market, that this is a “blueprint for
the complete socialisation” of the
industry, is surely premature and over
strong. This plan is not in front of
growers as a referendum; it seems safe
to say it never will be.
Rather than doing the industry a
disservice, Mr. Killen has given wool-
growers much to consider. His plan
has revealed the long-range ambitions
of the International Wool Secretariat,
for instance, in a way which the IWS
has never done. Where the IWS and
the Wool Board have used a good
deal of subterfuge in concealing ulti-
mate aims (sales to China, for
example), Mr. Killen boldly suggests
that, if necessary, the IWS might enter
into direct sales and even manufac-
turing. It can be taken for granted that
Mr. Killen would not have suggested
this had he not already discussed the
possibility with either Mr. Vines or Sir
William Gunn.
In suggesting this we do not see
how Mr. Killen suddenly becomes a
socialist. This was merely a suggestion,
a far step which might be taken if the

conditions made it necessary. Mr. Kil-
len strikes us as a man seeking his
road to Damascus.
The reaction of Mr. Killen’s own
organisation, the N.S.W. Graziers’, has
hardly been enthusiastic. Mr. Killen,
remember, is not only a member of the
Graziers’ and one of the biggest indi-
vidual growers in the country; he is
also on the executive of the Association.
The president of the N.S.W. Graziers’,
Mr. B. A. Wright, has simply asked all
growers to consider carefully all the
implications of the proposal. They may,
in June, discuss it at the Association’s
general meeting. At this stage the
executive is neither for it nor against,
says Mr. Wright. This strikes us as
exactly the proper note, a thoroughly
sensible attitude to what, we must
repeat, is merely a paper proposal.
It seems apparent that the Killen
proposal hoped to get support from the
trade. This, probably, was based on an
assessment of trade views supplied by
the IWS or the Wool Board. Both these
bodies are ill fitted to judge trade
opinion for the very simple reason that
they are a source of free handouts to
the trade. Naturally, a section of the
trade is going to take the handouts and
will do almost anything to obtain them.
Their real views are concealed for fear
that the handouts will cease. Bought
opinion, the kind the IWS and the Wool
Board get, is often false opinion.
It would seem that the reaction by
the trade (in Australia, anyway) to the
idea that the IWS should get into
manufacturing has been one of horror.
Already there is evidence of a strong
anti-Wool Board and anti-IWS move-
ment in the trade, supported by some
of the very people who have taken
advertising and promotion handouts in
the past.
The interesting development in 1967
may be this: sections of the trade, now
that they have an inkling of what at
least they think the IWS may be up to,
will enter strongly into wool discussions.
They will not be so easily bought-off
by IWS and Wool Board financial help
for advertising campaigns, etc.

Poison Hazard and Fruit
AN old maxim proclaims that an
apple a day keeps the doctor
away. Nowadays people worry
lest such a habit might, in fact, hasten
ill health. They are aware that modern
horticulture entails much spraying
with highly toxic chemicals. Their fears
are well founded, but the official view,
supported by the Apple and Pear Spray
Residue Committee, seems to be that
Australian consumers will find the
pome fruits safe and wholesome to eat.
This committee, comprising expert
chemists, was not appointed by grow-
ers or marketers. It was set up in
1957 by the Australian Agricultural
Council through the Standing Commit-
tee on Agriculture. Further vigilance
is maintained by the National Health
and Medical Research Council. The
Commonwealth Departments of Cus-
toms and Primary Industry conduct
frequent checks to safeguard the good
name of our produce on overseas
markets. This policing influences the
purity of the produce channelled on to
the home market. State Departments
of Health and Agriculture also keep a
wary eye out to protect local con-
sumers.
However, it appears that the
National Health and Medical Research
Council is not entirely happy with the
present state of affairs. It feels we may
need to take a stricter view of mer-
cury residues. The U.S.A.’s Food and
Drug Administration regards this
chemical as being so insidiously poison-
ous that it declares as unfit for human
consumption any food containing even
the slightest trace of mercury. We,
along with several other countries,
believe that concentrations of less than
one-hundredth of a part per million
in food are harmless.
The New South Wales Department of
Agriculture has found mercury in apples
and pears. It has also found, on
occasion, more lead arsenate and DDT
in our fruit than the Americans are
prepared to tolerate.,On the other hand,
residues of 17 other toxic sprays com-
monly used in our orchards have not
been found in samples of our fruit at
levels that exceed America’s highly
cautious standards.
The British believe that they have
stronger stomachs and generally their
regulations are somewhat easier. Never-
theless, a small proportion of samples
of our apples and pears destined for
the U.K. has been found containing
more lead and arsenic than is admis-
sible on even this market. No instances
of DDT or mercury exceeding British
standards have been found by our Cus-
toms Department.
ir pHE trouble with mercury is that it
does not stay on the surface of the
fruit skin from which it could be washed
off, but penetrates the flesh. DDT be-
haves similarly. Like arsenic, both are
cumulative poisons. Residues of the
other sprays used by orchardists can be
removed by washing or even simply
wiping the fruit. Most packing sheds
make some • attempt to remove spray
residues, but the methods at their dis-
posal are not fully effective. Apple and,
especially, pear eaters should never neg-
lect the precaution of washing or
thoroughly wiping the fruit.
Though it would appear, despite
official reassurances, that fruit-eating
could involve some threat to health, the
orchardist himself is at far greater risk
from the modern pesticides than the
consumer. Handling these chemicals is
downright dangerous. The wonder is
that more fatalities and serious illnesses
have not already occurred among
orchardists. The organic phosphates,
particularly parathion, are the most
hazardous to handle. Toxic amounts
may easily be absorbed through the
skin, by inhalation, or by ingestion.

FRED FLATOW
FRED FLATOW, who won Syd-
ney’s Frank Crowl Memorial
Tournament, a seven-round
“Swiss” held during the Aus-
tralia Day weekend, is not merely
one of the best chess players in
Australia but is also one of the
most dedicated. He was born in
Berlin in 1937, taken to China
with his family the following
year and there spent his early
boyhood. It was in China that his
father taught him the rudiments
of chess, when Fred was approxi-
mately seven years of age.
The Flatows migrated to Australia
in 1946 and it wasn’t long before Kurt
Flatow (one of Sydney’s leading
players) was taking young “Freddie”
along to the Metropolitan Chess Club
every Saturday morning. It was during
these Saturday morning visits that the
writer first became acquainted with the
future champion.
It wasn’t long before Fred was hold-
ing his own with experienced senior
players, and in 1950 he won the N.S.W.
Under 14 Championship, followed by
the Under 16 in 1853. He became
junior champion in N.S.W. in 1954. A
remarkable feature was the fact that
at no stage of the three tournaments
was he in any danger of losing a single
game. In his only attempt at the Aus-
tralian Junior he was placed third.
After leaving the junior ranks, Flatow
has succeeded in becoming Champion
of Sydney and of N.S.W. At the last
Australian Championship, held in
Hobart in 1964, he achieved seventh
placing in a very strong field, and
quite recently he was fifth in the
Canterbury (N.Z.) Club’s centennial
tournament, won by Grandmaster Yuri
Averbakh.
Fred Flatow’s interest in junior chess
has never waned and he does more
these days in giving chess youngsters
a helping hand than anyone else in
N.S.W. chess history.
The following game from the recent
New Zealand tournament shows Flatow
in devastating form against former
Hungarian Master, Paul Dozsa.
White: A. Flatow
Black: P. Dozsa
Opening: King’s Fianchetto Defence.
I. P-K4, P-KN 3; 2. B-84, B-N2;
3. P-Q4, P-Q3; 4. P-84, N-KB3;
5. P-K5, KN-Q 2;
Better for Black is 5 . . . PxP; 6,
BPxP; N-Q4.
6. N-KB3, N-N3; 7. B-N3, N-QB3;
8. P-83, B-B4;
Not 8 . . . B-N5 because of 9. BxPch
and Black’s game quickly crumbles.
9. N-R4, BxN; 10. Rxß, P-K3;
11. N-83, P-Q4;
With White having the strong
Bishop-pair, Black wisely restricts their
movement by blocking the centre.
12. B-82, R-QB1; 13. O-O, B-Bl;
14. P-KN 4,
Flatow launches out with an aggres-
sive attack. Why not? Although he has
created “holes” in front of his King,
there is not much that Black’s re-
stricted pieces can do about it.
14 . . . P-KR4; 15. P-B5!, NPxP;
If 15 . . . RPxP; Flatow can afford
a Knight sacrifice, e.g., 16. PxKP!,
PxN; 17, PxPch. If then 17 . . . KxP;
18, QxPch, and the end is in sight.
Or if 17 . . . K-Q2; 18. QxP again
decides the issue.
16. PxBP, B-R3; 17. Bxß, Rxß;
18. Q-Q2, KR-R 1; 19. K-Rl,
Although Black opened the Knight
file, it is Black that uses it.
19 . . . N-B5; 20. Q-84, Q-K2;
21. R-Nl, Q-Bl; 22. R-N5, K-K2;
23. B-Q3, N-N3; 24. QR-Nl, R-Kl;
25. R-N7, K-Ql; 26. N-N5, R-K2;
27. N-R7, RxN;
If 27 . . . Q-Kl; 28. N-86, Q-Bl; 29.
R-N8 and the Black Queen is lost.
28. RxR, Resigns.
There is nothing Black can do to
salvage his game.

Sobriety Rules Once More
AFTER an initial burst, the indus-
trial market has become its old
sober self. So it is that blue-chip
stocks are again being assessed on both
their immediate and medium-term
prospects.
Sooner or later the mining market
will also be reappraised. Metal prices
generally are a reflection of world eco-
nomic conditions. In the past year,
there has been a decided easing in the
rate of growth of the world’s major
economies the United States, Eng-
land, Germany. In sympathy with this
downturn, prices of major metals,
including copper, zinc, tin, and lead,
are significantly lower than last year.
Yet our mining market has steadily
moved higher! The higher it goes the
greater ultimately must be the fall.
In this general classification of min-
ing, I do not include oil exploration.
Oil has been in the dumps so long
that any wave of buying interest would
make that market move up substan-
tially.
Last week it was Longreach that
wormed its way into the portfolio. Now
Mid-Eastern makes its debut. In some
ways, Mid-Eastern is not unlike
Longreach. Both have mineral explora-
tion subsidiaries operating in Queens-
land and both have offshore oil
interests.
Mid-Eastern also holds land leaser
in N.S.W. and the Northern Territory,
but these are unlikely to have much
influence on the share price. On this
subject of price, the 45 cent contri-
buting shares touched 35 cents last
week and have since reacted to 31 cents~
A fair level to buy 1000 shares.
From oil I go to finance. Although
most investors are forever expressing
doubts about the finance industry, it
continues to make steady progress. If
profit growth is a measure of success,
then finance companies are among
the most successful of all. industrial
companies. The daddy of them all,
AGC, has shown a 12 percent growth
in earnings per share in each of the.
past five years.
One that has not yet reported for
the half year is Alliance Holdings. Last
year, profits were slightly higher,
although total funds employed in the-
business fell from $54 million to $5l
million. If funds employed can be in-
creased from this level and if the
improved profit margin can be main-
tained, then profit must move upward.
More pertinent in the short term to-
the share price is the MLC/H. G,
Palmer stigma. Quite unjustified in
the first place, this stigma should
slowly disappear. My purchase of 500
shares was at 70 cents.
In view of my earlier remarks on
mining companies, I feel obliged to
sell the 200 Broken Hill South. After
watching them rise to $3.35, I now
find myself selling at the purchase
price of $3. More embarrassing is the
loss of $26. However, -if phosphate in
Australia comes good, I still have my~
Longreach.

PROTEUS-
the aero-engine that
started a revolution
Chosen for the world’s largest hovercraft
Powerplant for the fastest fighting ships of eight navies
4 million flying hours in Britannia aircraft
Generates electrical power for industry
THE Bristol Siddeley Proteus, chosen as the
powerplant for the new, large-capacity
hovercraft, began its working
life conventionally enough in
a Britannia airliner.
Millions of flying hours later, it broke with
convention by powering a fast naval vessel.
This was a major breakthrough in marine
propulsion: a lightweight gas turbine afloat,
with four times more pow-
er per lb weight than any
marine engine.
Next, Proteus was installed in a village
in south-west England, supplying the inhab-
itants with 2,700 kW of electricity at peak
periods.
This opened up a new prospect of electrical
generation for power authorities and industry,
including high-output, mobile
power stations.
Other interesting applications
may well await this most versatile of engines.
Meantime, it can already justifiably claim to
have caused a revolution in power.
