•T'HE Maddermarket Theatre, world-
renowned as the home of the Norwich
Players, is a replica of an Elizabethan
theatre and is the only one of its kind in
Britain.
The realisation of the Theatre began in
1911 when an actor named Nugent
Monck, living in an Elizabethan house
in Norwich, produced several morality
plays in his drawing-room with his friends
as actors. They later hired a mediaeval
banqueting hall which seated only ninety-
nine people, and there gave public per-
formances of Shakespeare and Moiiere,
as well as mystery plays.
This work was interrupted in 1914 by
the first world war, but in 1919 the
Norwich Players began again with a pro-
duction of “Much Ado About Nothing.”
It was a great success, and within three
years it became necessary to find a larger
theatre. Nugent Monck, undeterred by
lack of funds, took a derelict eighteenth
century building situated in an alleyway.
This building had been in turn a church,
a baking-powder factory and a Salvation
Army Citadel ; now it was transformed
into a model of an Elizabethan theatre,
complete with an open or apron stage
balcony. It was named the Madder-
market Theatre, after the district in
which it stood and was opened on the
twenty-third of September, 1921.
The ideal of the Norwich Players was,
and is, to present only plays which are
first-rate of their type, and to produce
and act them with sincerity. The actors
are amateurs, they remain anonymous,
take no curtain calls and there is no
system of ‘principals.’ They have
achieved fame by their interpretation of
Shakespeare’s plays which they present
in much the same manner as the original
productions with no breaks between the
scenes, quick action, intimacy between
the audience and actors and, above all,
with Elizabethan zest. The Madder-
market remains to this day the only
theatre in England which is able to pre-
sent the plays as Shakespeare intended —
on an apron stage.
The Norwich Players, however, do not
confine themselves entirely to
Shakespeare, for during the past twenty-
eight years they have presented many
classical, period and modern plays which
have included mediaeval drama as well
as Greek, French, Russian and Chinese
drama and Restoration and Victorian
plays. The season extends from
September to July, the price of seats
ranging from eighteenpence to six
shillings.

RADIO TRAGEDY.
Beside his The Young Lions —a pot-
pourri of Tolstoy, Stephen Crane and
half-a-dozen of the more sombre modern
German novelists shredded through with
bits of the atmosphere of All Quiet on
the Western Front —Mr. Irwin Shaw’s
The Troubled Air is a simple tale of woe,
but no more cheerful.
It is a phenomenon of modern
American fiction that cheerfulness and
silence under suffering call for instant
excommunication. It is, of course, per-
missible to be incidentally ironic, sardonic,
mechanically comic or pornographically
humorous in loud, crude sentences ; but
to be simply cheerful for the general
public is now a worse crime with New
York publishers than to omit the bed-
room scene from every third chapter or
to write in plain English instead of in a
sort, of Teutonic-dialect English which
most authors now affect in the United
States.
The Troubled Air is—for an American
novel —a comparatively straightforwarcl
sample of how a loud and important
American industry suffers under a political
experiment in which a polyglot people
with English as a national language and
England as the mother of its forms and
cherished ideals of government is trying
to express itself in terms of liberty and
security through human machinery which
is mainly drawn from mid-European
countries —the Treumanns and the
Rosenbaums and the Impelleteris.
These, when dowered with authority,
seem inevitably to revert to the
habits and trends of thought of their
forefathers, with the result that its own
mother would not always recognise the
United States Constitution as interpreted
by them and their myrmidons of like
origin to themselves.
Mr. Shaw’s theme is the back-
ground of the drama of a delightful
radio programme, carried out by
the usual barnyard boiling of males
and females who form the newer
brand of dramatis personae in
American novels —feckless, as moral as
Tibetan polyandrous farmers, smart, pur-
poseless except for their “art,” their
highballs and their sex, supported in
insecure luxury by “sponsors”—hard-eyed
Semitic factory-owners—and herded by
18,000-dollar-a-year helots who know
no habit but servility and no law save
that of self-preservation. Suddenly this
caste is caught up in tragedy. A black-
mailing little magazine suspects most of
them of present or past connections with
the Communist party and of being under
threat of investigation by the F. 8.1. This
situation promises to have dire effects
upon the sales of the product which they
sponsor. And then what a coil —what
wailing at the wall, what cries of “You
goddam Red sonova Jewish bitch” ; what
overworking of the cruder word for an
illegitimate; what frequent mentions of
those parts of the human body which are
best forgotten in drawing-rooms; and
what an effort by Mr. Shaw to be under-
standing and tolerant of everybody, in-
cluding even the Communists, whom he
does not like, and of the F. 8.1., which
he seems to like less.
Mr. Hoover’s Sherlock Holmesery,
however, is the only agency in the whole
boiling of influences that drives his
characters to martyrdom which Mr. Shaw
does not understand. It never has become
quite plain to him (or for that matter to
most of the daily Press of America and
Australia) that police suspicion of young
men who were Communists for a summer
season in the heat of their callow youth
in 1922 is not born of hysteria induced
by the machinations of Senator McCarthy
and other “red-baiters,” but of hard ex-
perience, which has taught that such
innocents frequently turn up—like Com-
rade Jock Garden —among top-flight
Communist organisations 20 years after
their supposed abandonment of Mr. Karl
Marx in the distant snows of yesteryear.
Also Mr. Shaw does Mr. Hoover’s
bloodhounds little credit in believing that
the* arch-villain of the piece could have
survived undetected for 15 years or so
as a practising Communist and leader of
a cell. But he and all his characters are
so miserable, so cynical and generally so
brittle and volubly plausible (even when
the burlesque of Mr. Roy Rene seems to
hang about in some of the more tragic
situations) that one finds it difficult to be
analytical, but easy to generate the wicked
thought that Mr. Shaw might well have
learnt his persuasiveness selling Fuller
brushes or vacuum-cleaners.
Mainly the book seems to be valuable
as another bit of coloring for the vast
canvas of life as it is lived in the Greatest
and Richest Nation on earth, where no
man goes without turkey on Thanksgiving
Day and every man is free if Senator
McCarthy or the draft or the Commos
or the standover unions or the Ku-Klux-
Klan or the F. 8.1. don’t catch up with
him; the land where, as one ignoble
character remarks, “mercy killing” is
often “the question of the day doctors
with air-bubbles, husbands with bread-
knives, daughters with police-revolvers.”
This is one of the growing number of
American books which Moscow is wel-
coming with glee. It is apt to breed in
the non-American reader a nostalgia for
the wide-open steppes of Soviet Russia,
where there are no taxi-drivers who
throw earthy expletives at their fares, no
ugly, persecuted, dying refugee musicians
with hard-faced wives, no scented
actresses getting in and out of air-
conditioned and electrically-heated beds ;
nothing, in fact, but clean air, Joe Stalin
hard on your tail and the unadventurous
certainties of the concentration-camp
ahead.
EL VERDUGO.
A Motorist's History.
A. and R. have put out a new edition
of the late John Fairfax’s book Then and
Now, first published in 1937, re-titled
Historic Roads Round Sydney, a pleasant
little book to handle, with many maps,
real and imaginary. Royalties go to the
Sydney Day Nurseries and Nursery
Schools Association.
With its Waltonesque dialogues and its
humor perhaps more natural for not
being very brilliant, it demonstrates in
what a different world the motorist lives
from the tram- and train-traveller ; only
a motorist could have made these
historical divagations on the way to
Windsor, Kurrajong, Mulgoa, Camden
and Campbelltown, Palm Beach, Picton
and Stanwell Park, though ropes and an
alpenstock might have been more in order
oh the early road into Burragorang Valley
down which the author skidded, marvel-
ling that old-time bullock-drays had ever
managed it, and chopping through tree-
trunks that barred his passage.
Limitation of the traveller’s interest to
history further rarefies this motorist’s
world, and aided by the learned chatter of
the Jane he takes on most of his journeys
we do almost succeed in feeling that we
have been transported back a hundred
years or more. While Fairfax laments
the decay of old colonial houses, visiting
Rev. Samuel Marsden’s home, “Mamre,”
out from St. Mary’s, and finding, of Sir
John Jamison’s palatial mansion
“Regentville,” only some “splendid
cedar doors and some really magnificent
bow-shaped cupboards” installed, with a
stained-glass chapel-window, in the
modernised old Red Cow Inn, the reader
is surprised that so much, so evocative of
the past, can still be found. “Fernhill”
and “Glenmore,” mansions built by the
sons of Lieutenant William Cox, who
built the first road across the Blue
Mountains, survive, one as a boarding-
house, the other as a country golf-club;
“Denham Court” near Campbelltown is
still privately preserved with the four
lamps representing the seasons brought
out by the builder. Captain Brooks, who
bought the property (originally granted
to Judge Advocate Atkins) in 1812—from
such old stones, and old churches and
old pubs, the author recreates the past so
richly that one almost forgets the
concrete-roads, tiled butcheries and pubs,
telephone-poles and other modernities
which, for the ordinary viewer, edge the
past off the landscape.
Part of the secret of this spell is the
great number of stories raked up from
the “Herald” and the Mitchell Library
and put in when the road passes their
settings; for instance, on the way to
Wallacia, Fairfax tells the story of the
old farmer of Moorebank who used to
push his employees off a cliff when they
asked for their pay. A somewhat different
form of this story appeared in The
Bulletin last year as “A Ballad of Blood-
thirsty Bessie” —and though the balladist
says he got his facts from a paragraph in
a radio-paper it seems that, once again, he
has been indebted to the Fairfaxes. There
are many such good stories in the book,
and if they are not all of use to balladists,
they should be of interest to motorists;
it is a handbook of what is worth seeing
around Sydney, the more so since it has
been compiled by one who was more
able than most to go anywhere he
pleased, and chose these old roads.
Two P.-o.-w. Books.
Two p.-0.-w. books, both by Aus-
tralians, could hardly have been published
more opportunely than when the Japanese
peace treaty was being ratified, though
their being born twins may diminish their
sales.
The Naked Island by Russell Braddon
(Werner Laurie) and Slaves of the Son
of Heaven by R. H. Whitecrbss
(Dymock’s), following in the footseps of
Behind Bamboo, The Endless Years and
several other Malayan p.-0.-w. books,
have little, naturally, to add to what has
been already revealed of those endless
years behind bamboo.
Braddon’s is the more polished style
(though sometimes facetious); White-
cross’s simple directness is a lesson in
the value of restraint. Whitecross con-
cerns himself almost wholly with exist-
ence in captivity; Braddon, with some-
times exceptional vividness, describes, as
well, the fighting which landed him there.
Braddon’s narrative style never lags;
from his first introduction to manners
military when the recruiting sergeant in
peaceful Martin-place tries to hot a
cigarette from him, through Singapore
to the savagery of Nip-filled jungles, his
story is clearly visualised and lucidly
written, conveying that conviction of
heroic achievement which stirs the blood
as one reads.
Whitecross’s story, while omitting the
clash and heat of battle, has as much to
offer in his restrained study of men bear-
ing unimaginable travail with quietly
heroic fortitude. How the agony was
borne is indicated by one paragraph: —
There grew amongst us a sense of humor
which nothing could quench, and which
helped all of us to endure conditions which
can only be fully understood by those who
went through them. This sense of humor,
with a grim determination that nothing
must break our spirit, became an under-
standing between us. It could not be called
a code, as this understanding was never
expressed. But it was almost universally
adhered to, and the few who broke down
and moaned were scorned, and shut out
from the comradeship of other men.
Whitecross illustrates his book with
memory - provoking photographs of
bridges on the Death Railway and ridges
across his mates’ emaciated bodies;
Braddon has the assistance of camp-rnate-
artist Ronald Searle, now one of the fore-
most of London’s illustrators. Though
there were many artists present at the
recent war, few got the complete treat-
ment, as Searle did; and such pictures
as that of the skinny p.-0.-w. holding up
a heavy stone as punishment while Jap
guards look on have an intensity denied
to most other war artists.
Both books, published when the
Federal Parliament was debating the Jap
treaty, will make more than p.-0.-w.’s
interested in the progress made, in seven
short years, in the “democratisation” of
Japan.
Roy Campbell Again.
Of the poetic phenomena of this cen-
tury surely one of the most extraordinary
is the revival of interest, among poets, in
mystical writings and experiences. Now
the South African, Roy Campbell, who
in spite of his Mithraic Emblems was
previously mainly distinguished for a
number of unecclesiastic lyrics of great
beauty, but also of great violence, and
for some of the best satiric verse pro-
duced in our time, has translated Poems
of St. John of the Cross (Harvill Press).
As one of T. S. Eliot’s main mystical
sources, this book will be of considerable
interest. It is the first attempt at trans-
lation into equivalent English verse since
in 1929-31 an authentic and revised text
of the original became available.
St. John of the Cross was one of the
earliest and most faithful followers of St.
Teresa in her religious reforms. His zeal
led him to imprisonment and all kinds of
extreme hardship, through which he was
sustained by a unique mystical vision.
Some authorities consider his mystical
writings second only to those of St.
Augustine. His fame in this respect rests
on a small number of poems, written
under ecstatic conditions, and on four
long prose commentaries On these poems.
Roy Campbell, after a stormy journa-
listic career in South Africa and a sojourn
at Oxford, more or less adopted Spain as
his second country. He became a bull-
fighter of some note, earned the hostility
of English Leftist intellectuals by fighting
on Franco’s side during the Spanish civil
war, and saved the Carmelite archives of
Toledo during the siege of that city. His
knowledge of the Spanish language and
literature no doubt fitted him excep-
tionally well for the present task.
However, long familiarity with Camp-
bell’s own poetry led the present writer
to approach the work with certain reser-
vations. It seemed doubtful if that
violent temperament would prove suffi-
ciently “mystical” to achieve a satisfac-
tory synthesis. After careful reading,
these misgivings remain, with an addi-
tional doubt: is the effect of flatness here
entirely the fault of the translator?
Might it be that St. John’s poems are
drained of some of their value by being
presented apart from his prose com-
mentaries?
M. C. D’Arcy, S.J., who supplies an
introductory note to the volume, em-
phasises that this is mystical verse in
which things are not quite what they may,
at first reading, seem. Yet here the
mysticism is Christian, not pagan, and
should puzzle the reader neither more
nor less than does, say, the religious
poetry of Traherne. Comparison with
a group of some of Traherne’s shorter
poems which resemble the form of the
Spaniard’s enhances the impression that
in effect this verse is less fervently
inspiring.
On the other hand Campbell’s trans-
lation, in many instances, scarcely seems
to do justice to the Original. This is a
bilingual text, and a very slight familiarity
with the Spanish reading seems to prove,
somewhat disastrously for the translator,
that the limping measures and inept-
nesses of the English version are not due
to inherent structural weaknesses in the
Spanish original. Campbell has made a
line-by-line translation preserving almost
invariably the original rhyme-scheme.
What happens to the rhythm? Alas, any
reader accustomed to the Salvation
Army’s practice of adapting popular
tunes to their hymns will only with diffi-
culty restrain himself from humming the
greater number of these verses to the
emphatic end-stopped thump of “Clemen-
tine.” Compare:
Light she was and like a feather,
And her shoes were number nine,
Herring boxes without topses
Sandals were, for Clementine—
with:
He will stay with us forever
As a Comrade He- will stay,
Till the present dispensation
Is consumed and fades away.
But it does cot read thus in Spanish:
Y que con ellos continue
El JTiismo se quedaria,
Hasta que se consumase
Este sigio que corria.
The thorny old question arises, of
course, as to the comparative virtues of
various methods of translation. A rigid
lifie-for-line approximation frequently
leaves little scope for the solution of
various difficulties. For instance, what
is musical and fresh in the Spanish be-
comes, too easily, ugly and jarring in the
English. “Vole tan alto, tan alto” reads
musically: “And up I soared so high,
so high” does not.
Again, might it be that English readers
are “spoiled” ; that the prevailing flatness
is a result of the great richness of the
English language in religious poetry of
its own. Perhaps it is significant that
Campbell, elsewhere, has written a more
convincing poem about St. John than any
he can borrow from him;
His voice an iris through its rain of jewels
Or are they tears, those embers of desire,
Whose molten brands each gust of song
re-fuels?
He crucifies his heart upon his lyre . . .
NANCY KEESING.
The Sky Is Blue : Stephen Lister (Peter
Davies). Mr. Lister’s stage is still the
Riviera; this story is of the illegitimate
son of a Russian grand duke and a British
governess who is rescued as a lost child
by a French prostitute in Shanghai, and
brought to France. He grows up a gigolo,
handsome, and of immense strength, tries
the honest life of advertising in England
as an artist, but almost wrecks his
employer by circulating all over the
country an obscurely obscene poster, an
marries the daughter of a millionaire
manufacturer. They are separated; he
becomes a member of the French under-
ground during the recent war, and tor-
tures a German extortioner into 8
up his fabulous loot; on this, after the
war, he lives riotously among the ncn
international society of the R mel ?’
according himself, in deference te
general love of fake or dubious titles, tn
title of Prince Balgoroukoff; and at the
end of the book he is shown obeying the
Russian urge to return to his birthplace.
Acidly amusing.

WITH LOINS GIRT.
The United Kingdom Budget provides a
tiring load to carry for an island country
which has been bearing the burden of
war and its aftermaths up to the limit
for 12 years, during which it has under-
gone several major operations for the
removal of important sections of its
Empire and has been forced to spend
huge sums on defence.
Two wars and the post-war difficulties
have now so sapped United Kingdom re-
sources that the country is literally fight-
ing to find the money to continue to
live; for to live it must buy its food and
raw products generally overseas. Despite
a gallant programme of mechanisation
and farm enterprise, which has resulted
in a one-third increase in the output of
local food products since 1939 —in a
period during which Australian per
capita production has steadily declined—
Britain must import on a huge scale or
starve. It could not by any stretch of
imagination survive on its own local food
resources as might the United States,
Canada and —if the unions would let it
—Australia, if all sea communications
were cut and credit and reserves dried up
completely.
In the United Kingdom foreign-
currency reserves are in danger of
drying up. Mr. Butler said in
his Budget speech that they had fallen to
£632 million sterling, which in a country
of 50 million people that is spending
roughly £l5OO million a year on defence,
maintaining military forces in 19 parts
of the globe, and taking part in the re-
habilitation of numerous other countries,
particularly those former sections of its
Empire embraced by the Colombo Plan,
is about as near to the edge of the preci-
pice as it is possible to go without
catastrophe. Another couple of half-
years like the last would have completely
dissipated “the foundation on which
is built the whole structure of
trade between the sterling area
and the rest of the world” . . . the
resources without which the country
would be “unable to secure either its
daily bread or the raw-materials on which
production and employment depend.”
This year Britain’s defence effort
calls for an expenditure of £1462
million sterling out of total Budget
expenses of £4240 million, inclusive of
£B5 million in American aid, but exclu-
sive of capital assistance to defence con-
tractors and about £62 million sterling
for the preliminaries of civilian defence.
Of this amount a little more than two-
fifths will be accounted for by the pro-
duction plans of the Government, which
are mainly concerned with large-scale out-
put of basic defence necessities —about
a fifth on tanks and transport, a fifth on
aircraft and a quarter on stores and
ammunition. The rest goes for the main-
tenance of Army, Navy and R.A.F.
On April 1 this year it is planned to
have 857,000 men in the three services,
348,000 of them national-servicemen con-
scripted for two years to be sent any-
where needed, including the war fronts.
About 60 per cent, of the members of the
British battalions in Korea are compul-
sory servicemen. Next year it is expected
that the services will have expanded to
900,000, and this huge diversion of man-
power, which might be earning fresh re-
serves for the sterling area’s purchasing
needs, does not account for the whole of
the drain by defence on the labor pool.
What that drain will be when
the rearmament effort really is in
full swing can be gauged from
the fact that about 50,000 defence
contracts have been let; that 177,000
men are needed for the aircraft
industry alone ; and that a further 50,000
will be drawn into it by the end of
1952-53. And even if Budget export
targets are realised the Government feels
“with regret” a £lOO million restriction
of imports necessary to cope with the
situation.
The amazing thing is that a bombed,
tired, continuously-threatened people who
are still looked on as the milch-cow of
civilisation by large sections of the
world’s population can face the situation.
But it is not only facing it but dealing
with it in a spirit of optimism. The em-
phasis is no longer on the load, but on
the incentives to shoulder it to the crest
of the hill and have done with it.
The expedients of the Butler Budget
are not mere palliatives. They distribute
the weight more evenly and equably, and
discourage luxury spending while provid-
ing incentives to longer working hours
and holding out a helping hand to those
inclined to pant under the strain. The
bank rate has been raised from 2\ per
cent, to 4 per cent., a measure which
though it will increase borrowing rates
will help to stem the loss of overseas
credits. Food subsidies are taken
off and the money needed to provide
them is reapplied where it will do most
good. Thus food will be dearer —bread
by lyd. a loaf, meat 4d. a pound, milk
Id, a quart more and tea something sub-
stantially more.
But lower-level earners will be com-
pensated. Single men and women receive
slight relief, but those who need it, the
married with families, in the lower-
income brackets will find their income tax
either wiped out or so reduced as to be
painless by comparison with previous
rates. A married taxpayer with three
children and a £5OO-a-year income will
pay only £1 6s. Bd. sterling, against the
Australian rate of £9 11s. and the pre-
vious British rate of £l3. Altogether,
about 2,000,000 former taxpayers are now
tax-free, and the average worker has
sufficient tax-margin over his head (even
with inevitable wage-rises in some in-
dustries) to induce him to work overtime,
secure in the knowledge that he will still
have no tax-impost to face. Everywhere
in the Budget the emphasis is on
incentive.
As a guarantee that rising defence and
other industrial programmes will not
mean rising wealth for large earners the
excess-profits tax has been raised to 30
per cent, on profits averaging more
than the rates of 1947-49. The emphasis
on work as the main objective of the
nation is shown by increases in the
entertainment taxes.
Liquor and tobacco, the poor man’s
solaces, are left untouched. Petrol goes
up to 4s. 3d. a gallon and car-licences to
a level £l2 10s.
Even the “Manchester Guardian,”
slow to applaud any action by a Conser-
vative Government, praised Mr. Butler’s
measures as “ingenious,” and the only
general criticism comes from the sullen
class-war “Labor,” which places party
before country and Socialism before
everything.
If Mr. Butler succeeds, as he hopes to
do, in doubling the United Kingdom’s re-
serve balances, an aspiration which calls
for substantial increase in production and
exports, as well as in producing the
surplus of £5OO million which he has
budgeted to achieve by economies and
the elimination of waste, his name will
go down as one of the great Chancellors
of British history.
His proposal that the country should
now shelve its Socialist dreams, “throw
off some of the crippling load of expense
and taxation and go into action with loins
girt and inspired by the knowledge that
if we work harder we can earn more”
will have an appeal to the spirit of the
British people likely to produce the
traditional kind of response. And some
real progress will be made towards re-
establishing the United Kingdom in the
world-leadership which it lost under Mr.
Attlee’s bread-and-dripping regime of
sorrow, sweat. Socialism, Shinwell,
Strachey and Strauss —incubuses calcu-
lated to grind any nation into the dust.
A Season for Action.
“We have been trying to spend more
than we earn,” said Mr. Menzies, explain-
ing the latest ban on imports. The same
applies to the whole sterling area. The
drastic jamming-on of brakes in national
spending is a feature of simultaneous
action in Britain, Australia and New
Zealand—together the backbone of the
sterling area.
Manifestly the January conference of
British Commonwealth Finance Ministers
in London underestimated the immediate
seriousness of the position—perhaps that
was a result of efforts to concert action.
At any rate the wires burnt with a new
urgency after the conference dispersed,
and the serious financial crisis in France
was followed by reports from London of
increased exhaustion of sterling balances
and a hastening towards what Mr.
Menzies called in his national broadcast
“the danger of international insolvency.”
The alert in its simplest form was
recorded in New Zealand. There com-
plexities of the situation are least
intrusive; impact and the reaction can
be studied in a smaller field ; there is less
of ill-balance in the provision of the
staples of trade. New Zealand’s climate
permits a more rapid expansion of small-
farmer exports. While licensing imports
from non-sterling countries, her Govern-
ment believes it can avoid any ban on
British imports, except motor-cars. N.Z.
Prime Minister Holland’s statement is
valuable because it tells the recent story
in simple words:
The London conference asked N.Z. to
increase her prospective surplus of £5
million in her balance of payments with
the non-sterling area to £l3 million.
[That is to say, by that much to help
carry the sterling area’s dollar trading-
deficit.] We accepted the target.
Upon my return, just as Cabinet had
decided we could reach that target with-
out general import-licensing, we received
the latest figures from U.K. which called
for re-examination of the whole situation
in the light of continued depletion of the
sterling area’s gold and dollar reserves.
N.Z. was asked to increase her target
surplus with the non-sterling area to £35
million.
This is a real headache, but If N.Z.
can contribute a surplus of £35 million....
it will make a valuable contribution which,
if matched proportionately by other
member-countries, will put the sterling-
area countries through their trouble.
Cabinet therefore accepted this new target
of £35 million surplus, and the U.K. has
been advised accordingly. N.Z. with other
countries would face disaster if the sterl-
ing area were to fail.
The crisis will not be solved by eco-
nomic Jitters but by bold and sensible
judgment and action.
That explains the purport of consulta-
tions which have been proceeding since
the London conference ended. Chancellor
Butler in his Budget speech said: “The
striking manner in which our fellow-
members of the Commonwealth have
answered to my further appeal reminds
me of their moving response in more than
one war.” For Australia Mr.
Menzies has presented an attitude
more independent, or seeming inde-
pendent. Politically and economically
the reasons are obvious. Australia’s
industrial development is more advanced
and complex than New Zealand’s, and she
has to face an acute internal unbalance
of her own. But with the deepening of
the crisis this country will find itself
abandoning any pretences that may be
thus encouraged ; and the Commonwealth
Cabinet’s devoting all energies to reviving
production of the old basic food and
raw materials may be taken as an admis-
sion that we have not grown so far ahead
of New Zealand’s qualitative status in the
sterling area as we are sometimes led to
suppose. If for this vital year Australia
is going to “match proportionately”
N.Z.’s extra effort in exports, Mr.
Menzies admits that it will have to be
in wheat and minerals. Maybe also we
shall do something in the way of extra
military help in the Middle East, where
British holding forces represent not only
the N.A.T.O. effort to prevent war, but
also a heavy drain on the British
Treasury.
To all those who receive this crisis
with what the N.Z. Prime Minister justly
calls “the economic jitters”—and there
are some disgraceful examples of such
jitters in responsible quarters in Aus-
tralia —Mr. Holland’s explanation of the
good home reason for taking on some
of Britain’s burden, and some of her
people’s regime of austerity, applies quite
as much in Australia as in New Zealand.
Collapse of sterling, he said, would mean
that the U.K. would not be able to pay
the post-war prices for wool and dairy
produce, and then, on present conditions,
we should not be able to purchase
essential imports except for cash and in
hand-to-mouth fashion.
So much for Dr. Evatt’s intemperate,
unconsidered and merely cantankerous
description of the Australian Govern-
ment’s moves as a “repudiation” of the
London conference decisions. His hypo-
critical wailing about import-licensing as
throwing “the affairs of tens of thousands
of citizens engaged in commerce” to “the
control of subordinate officials” —which
was what his Government did for three
years in the cause of socialisation
—matches his recent spurious condemna-
tion in this emergency of the use by the
Menzies Government of those restric-
tions of bank credit which were the very
lifeblood of the Government in which
Dr. Evatt was deputy-leader. As Mr.
Menzies said of him in the recent Can-
berra debate, “he can pedal backwards
faster than anyone I have seen.”
Controls and belt-tightening will help
us through immediate straits, but as a
remedy for Australia’s economic sickness
they can be no more efficacious under
Mr. Menzies than they were under Mr.
Chifley. They can no more forbid
insolvency which comes from spending
more than the minimum we have con-
sented to earn than price-fixing can keep
down prices of scarce goods, or inflation
can represent value in wages which is not
there. Some restrictions may be eased
and all should be lifted in the shortest
possible time ; they can be lifted only
by hard work, longer work and increased
output.
For the moment they are necessary ills,
and argument about their necessity is
quite futile. Many more people are
going to be hurt —if that is the only way
the call for effort registers with them —
than those Sydneyites who have
immediately rushed to the wailing-wall in
Hunter-street. The reverse aspect of the
Government’s banning of imports and
travelling credits, its increased land-tax
exemption and concessions to primary
producers (next year to all fluctuating
incomes) on provisional-tax payments, is
a reduction in the Government’s own
plans for spending money it will not
receive. Because Customs and direct-tax
revenues will fall Ministers properly fore-
shadow another cut in departmental
expenditures, also in Government and
State works. Government stockpiling of
materials against war, a review of price-
subsidies on foodstuffs and possibly a
curtailment of immigration except for
rural labor.
Dr. Evatt will be able to work up a
really good wail over all this in the course
of urging the people to believe that all
troubles will vanish if they vote for a
party which will abolish credit restric-
tions, restore the Socialists’ “milk-bar
economy,” cut down sales-tax, abandon
rearmament, natipnalise the land and con-
fiscate farm-holdings from farmers who
do not accept Government direction on
prices for their products, and restore
Commonwealth subsidies on all
consumer-goods prices (which is disguised
under the name of “price-control”). This
is the programme formally issued by the
“Labor” central executive as party policy
for “avoiding a slump.”
The country must by this time have
had enough of this crabbed nonsense.
Yet the Government will encourage these
jitters so long as it merely remains on
the defensive with controls. Its job is
to take the offensive with direction of the
national energies to work. Except by
lifting wheat-planting “every extra
bushel now is worth two dollars in
export-trade”—and production of metals,
it may be able to show no great export
improvement this year; but next year
must tell a different story, and the ground-
work for that must be laid now.
One thing the Government might do
is to prohibit under National Resources
Board regulation all feeding of beef to
“the dogs” in the interest of conserving
it for export. The disclosure by a Com-
monwealth Minister the other day that in
Tasmania alone pounds of prime
beef is fed each week to racing grey-
hounds” is scandalous enough to provoke
public riots.
Tourists and Hotels.
From Auckland: Maorilanders are
geting a lot of unsolicited advice about
how to cash-in on their tourist attractions
in sterling and dollars, but this isn’t mak-
ing much impression in quarters that
count most —that is, with the hotel
industry.
When J. G. Bridges, director-general
of John Bull’s Travel and Holidays
Association, was in New Zealand lately
he told Maorilanders they had a
“wonderful chance,” with more attrac-
tions than in any other comparable area
of the earth’s surface, but they
wouldn’t get anywhere unless they
made up their minds to develop
tourist traffic as a “highly-scientific
business.” Tourist steamer fares
were going to be slashed by 25 per cent,
on some routes, and N.Z. would have to
prepare if it wanted its share of the
traffic coming. Maorilanders listened
when he told them hotels were the “raw
material of the tourist trade,” and that
people going there must be sure of get-
ting the service they could pay for and
“were entitled to,” but that was as far as
their response went.
In Rotorua, Maoriland’s No. 1 tourist
resort, where hotels and boarding-houses
are fewer than a decade ago, although the
traffic is growing all the time, a licence
for a new hotel to cost £130,000 is going
begging. The reason? Because no one
who can afford to put up a five-star, 90-
guest hotel is going to spend, on the
average, £l5OO a guest-room to do it. A
couple of years ago the figure would
have been about £llOO a room, or
£lOO,OOO for the whole outfit.
This is a clue to trends generally. Witt
costs soaring like this hotel-growth is
paralysed. No rose-tinted prospects ot
big tourist business will induce cos. o
saddle themselves with such overmflated
capital charges. Either N.Z. will have to
put more muscle into its building mdus y
or water-down hotel standards to ge
things moving again; perhaps a httie o
both. There’ll be no rich strike in the
tourist trade until the stranglehold
costs is broken. But Maonlan
antiquated liquor laws will
to be overhauled, too. Ther f ..
stampede to crowded hotel bars
last hour every day, which fnghte di „
visitors from abroad and is a
disgrace.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The "Larrikin Strain."
What Dr, Evatt knows about economics
would not be an overdose for an instruc-
tion-hour in any primary school. But
what chiefly stood out in his two efforts
at attacking the emergency import-
restrictions last week was his inability to
appreciate the Chancellor of the
Exchequer’s own words in praise of the
co-operation of Australia and New
Zealand in the sterling area’s effort, led
by Britain, to conserve overseas balances
by reducing imports as an immediate
and temporary counter-action. The presi-
dent of the Board of Trade endorsed them
when questioned in the Commons.
Dr. Evatt has “read all the reports and
statements issued from the London con-
ference,” and the Menzies Government’s
action is, he says, “repudiation of the
London agreement”—also “churlish,”
“irrational” and “panicky.” Since he does
not know, or refuses to recognise, that
urgent post-conference messages from
London requested the Australian and
New Zealand Governments to take even
more drastic steps than the conference
had agreed, his observations fall as silly
and invalid.
Taking him at his own valuation —
since he obviously has the secret recipe
for righting the situation with a few bold
strokes —why does he not offer his ser-
vices to the “Labor” Government in his
own State? If he could save Australia he
could save N. S. Wales, and in the
McGirr outfit, which purports to have
given prosperity to N.S.W., Dr. Evatt’s
own brother’s functions are not under-
advertised. Why does not he seize this
chance to show Australians what the
Evatt family can do, where they have
the opportunity, to buck up exports and
relieve the economic doldrums? Why be
content to wrangle for radio-time to de-
liver mere criticism in opposition of
others’ efforts?
When he was in office himself, during
those priceless years of Australia’s
opportunity after the recent war, this
paragon in his own esteem wasted
the country’s chances. What
“Labor” policy, to which he is pledged,
did for Australia was to run it into the
present mess, like the Attlees did in
Britain, in the cause of disastrous Social-
isation experiments.
All he is doing now is to reveal to
his fellow-countrymen at close range what
his former subordinate, now a Minister
in the Menzies Government, described in
Dr. Evatt’s conduct of Australia’s foreign
relations as “a larrikin strain.”
McGirr's Shape in Crisis.
Australia’s effort to haul itself out of
its economic difficulties is a job to which
it is urgently called by the Menzies
Government, as part of a British Com-
monwealth production drive by the
whole sterling area.
The effort will probably win or lose on
the reaction of the McGirr Government
in N. S. Wales, which State is the main
source of coal and coal-derived power,
of steel and steel products urgently re-
quired in all construction jobs and for
farmers’ requisites, and is also the worst
back-slider in wheat-production and in
maintenance of sea transport-services.
The McGirrs have so far devoted any-
thing in the way of political energy
which they possesses to obstruction of
national advancement under the “Labor”
partisan cry of “no co-operation with the
Menzies Government.” Since the
Socialists’ obstruction in the Common-
wealth Parliament was removed with the
elimination of their rump in the late
Senate, the business of blocking the Com-
monwealth Government’s policy for in-
creasing production has been relegated to
the McGirrs in N.S.W.
Of delay in vital works and political
“Labor’s” tolerance of go-slow as a
means of baulking national development
schemes there has been nothing worse in
the whole shameful record than the story
of the Pyrmont power-station. That is
symptomatic of many other things—the
stagnation and bankruptcy of the N.S.W.
transport services, the dilapidation of the
port of Newcastle, the constant union
blockades of the port of Sydney, the
spasmodic failures of the State’s power-
supplies on top of the regular reduction
of the power-week to four working-days
in Sydney and the impertinent indiffer-
ence of the McGirr Government to any
of these things. Pyrmont is symptomatic ;
but it enables every citizen to see the
real canker in Australian industry and in-
dustrial politics at close range.
The Commonwealth Prime Minister’s
call to the nation for an understanding
of the new import restrictions as the
short-term means of meeting a threat of
national bankruptcy was greeted by
Premier “Gimme” McGirr as a deliberate
attempt by the national Government to
“bring back the man-made depression of
the ’thirties.” He invited the public to
“express their contempt” of the Menzies
Government and to join him in trying to
“remove it from office.” He described
the denial to him of loan moneys which
simply cannot be raised as a breach of
the Housing Agreement by the Com-
monwealth Government, about which (he
said) he was seeking legal advice on
grounds for action in the High Court.
He referred to prior calls of national de-
fence on materials available as a trumped-
up excuse to prevent the McGirrs from
pursuing their own wasteful policy of
works employing McGirr voters on
“Government stroke.”
His policy for the times, as issued to
him by the Trades Hall junta which
directs all his “Government’s” words and
actions, consists of:
Abandoning: credit restrictions.
Cutting taxation, especially sales tax.
Reducing: expenditure on defence.
Increasing food-supply by nationalising
farming and farmlands.
Heavy subsidising of food-prices in the
name of “price-control,” as the chief
objective of Commonwealth public ex-
penditure.
This is the leader of the Communist-
poisoned mob that the electors of the
chief industrial State voted into power
when the crisis was young two years ago.
--
Another Few Acres Each.
According to the Commonwealth
Statistician’s latest figures the number of
wheatgrowers in Australia is about
45,000. To these men Prime Minister
Menzies made a direct appeal in his
broadcast concerning the import-cuts and
the nation’s economy. He asked them
to sow an additional million acres of
wheat, which would be worth 30 million
dollars and would increase the sterling
area’s funds by about £l4 million.
Part of the response by wheatgrowers’
spokesmen:
H. K. Nock (Farmers and Settlers’ Asso-
ciation) : Unless farmers are assured by
seeding-time that the stabilisation scheme
is altered it will be too late to remedy the
position.
T. C. Stott (Wheatgrowers’ Federation):
It is economically impossible to expand
wheat production at the present crippling
t£LX*T
W. W. Pratt (Wheatgrowers’ Union);
Mr. Menzies’s appeal is hopeless wheat-
growers deserve some taxation concessions.
G. H. Hunter (Victorian Wheat and
Wool Growers’ Association): Mr. Menzies’s
appeal is a challenge not only to wheat-
growers but to State and Federal Govern-
ments.
J. C. Gorman (same organisation): The
way the Government is treating food-
producers is a colossal fraud. It urges
increased production, yet it won’t give any
incentive.
All Mr. Menzies asked, on the basis
of the Commonwealth average yield and
the number of wheatgrowers, is for each
of them to sow another 22 acres, using
perhaps an extra half-ton of seed and
super each, and running the tractor for
a few extra hours. This he asks not for
himself and not for the growers, but for
the country.
Love of country is as strongly pro-
nounced in wheatgrowers as in any other
section of Australians. There is hardly a
man of them, if told by these spokesmen
what the Prime Minister really asked for,
who wouldn’t have responded to the
appeal irrespective of his personal
opinions about taxation, prices and other
things. But they ought to restrain or
change their spokesmen. “Organisations”
of almost every variety are becoming
noxious weeds in this country.
"Youth Carnival."
i -
Communist “Youth Carnival,”
which was to synchronise with the Royal
visit, is now in full swing somewhere in
Sydney, and the public have had a good
chance to see what sort of a carnival it is.
Having failed to secure facilities for
holding it fivm Sydney City Council the
organisers, who appear to have unlimited
funds, proceeded + o hire grounds at Fair-
field, a Sydney suburb. Fairfield council
tried to stop the demonstration, having
some idea of the subversive nature of the
enterprise in which delegates from Soviet
Russia and Iron Curtain ■countries were
to be included as part of the drive for
“peace” under the Youth bauner which
bears the emblems of the dove and the
fighting boomerang. But the \sponsors
won a court action, and the shov went
on. V
What happened subsequently should
be carefully noted by the A.C.T.U. and
those sections of “Labor” which tre
always vocal in the interests of fiVe-
speech and discussion when Communist-
party interests are concerned. Aldermen
were visited by snarling groups of young
thugs and threatened with violence. A
demonstration by citizens against raised
rates and valuations was Red-anted, and
assumed such a complexion that the
mayor invoked police protection —very
wisely if the experience of some of the
Australia First men and of unionists like
Mr. Lovegrove, of Victoria, who a few
years ago was severely battered, go for
anything. Cabled protests in ferocious
language arrived from behind the Iron
Curtain.
Next the memorial trees in the Honor-
avenue planted to remember Fairfield’s
dead of World War II were torn up, the
bronze plaques recording the names of
the killed dragged from their cement
moorings and tossed into the road. When
they and the trees were replaced they
were torn up twice again and the name-
plaques smashed. The flowers in the
avenue have been destroyed.
When the carnival opened, the Com-
munists present, Australia’s most voci-
ferous advocates of freedom of speech
and propaganda assaulted and illegally
searched young Russians who were dis-
tributing pamphlets hostile to Com-
munism in the grounds.
Horrible as this sort of thing is it will
have its uses if it brings home to Aus-
tralians the true nature of Communism
and the propaganda for “peace” which
it conducts through functions like the
carnival.
Mr. Clarrie Martin's Amnesia.
About the worst case of political amnesia
for a generation is that of Mr.
Clarrie Martin, Mr. McGirr’s Attorney-
General, who is shocked that Mr. Roger
Dean, M.P., should believe that decent
trade-unionists in the A.L.P. industrial
groups are using an amendment to the
Arbitration Act passed by the Menzies
Government to oust Communists from
union leadership.
Mr. Martin declared that if Mr, Dean
gave “more careful thought to the history
of the legislation” he would discover that
the provision under which the Iron-
workers’ historic ballot was held was
inserted in the Act by the Chifley Govern-
ment. Mr. Martin continued:
The real soldiers in the still-continuing
struggles against Communism in this country
are the A.L.P. Central Executive and the
Labor industrial groups, who challenged
their enemies by the democratic processes
of their country’s courts.
So far the only casualties from A.L.P.-
executive fire seem to have been the
A.L.P. industrial groups in S. Australia,
and the only other action which the
A.L.P. Central Executive appears to
have taken against Communism is
to swallow its policy and some
of its leaders whole. Their president,
Mr. Ferguson, formerly a leading
Communist, is a case in point.
As recently as June, 1945, the “Stan-
dard,” official organ of the Australian
Labor Party, then edited by the erudite
Mr. Leslie Haylen, M.P., averred that
“the Labor party does not consider the
Communist party a political menace
It is not the purpose of the Labor party
to disrupt the trade-union movement by
fighting a guerrilla war with the Com-
munists for official positions in the unions.
Who the unions appoint to official posi-
tions in the Labor party is not the affair
of the Labor party.”
Only last year the A.L.P. was selling
the most recent report of the triennial
conference of the Federal A.L.P., in
which Queensland stalwarts were advised
to apply for information about the
“Labor” movement to one of the most
notorious Communists in the country, M.
Healy, of the Brisbane Trades Hall
Council.
Mr. Martin has also forgotten that the
Chifley Government brought down its
legislation hurriedly during the coal strike
of 1949 only after Mr. Menzies had
introduced a private bill along lines
similar to his amendments of 1951 ; that
the Chifley Government turned down that
private bill when the Opposition had it
debated and it had become clear that
Mr. Chifley’s own bill was a mere bluff
to satisfy public opinion without harm-
ing the Communists.
It was not till the Menzies Govern-
ment’s amendment, passed last year, was
operative that unionists had any chance
or made any real attempt to oust the
Communist leaders of the big unions.
But the most important thing which
Mr. Martin completely forgot, and of
which Mr. Treatt, the State Opposition-
leader, reminded him next day, was that
there is a N. S. Wales State arbitration
system side-by-side with the Common-
wealth system, and that neither Mr.
McGirr nor Mr. Martin has lifted a
finger to give unionists under N.S.W.
State awards the same chance to clean
Communists out of the unions as has
been vouchsafed to unions operating
under Commonwealth registration.
Socialists Can't Farm.
Socialised farming cost the British people
somewhere close on £5O million, lost in
attempts to grow peanuts and eggs in
Africa. What it has cost the Queensland
people, in the failure of the pig
and sorghum scheme at Peak Downs,
will be known only when the Gair Gov-
ernment makes the figures public.
The plan, known as the Queensland-
British Food Corporation’s £2,500,000
Scheme, was to take over large areas of
central Queensland and there grow grain
sorghum to feed pigs for the British
people. The corporation, a child of the
Attlee Socialists, got an advance of
£1,875,000 from the British Government,
and the Hanlon Government put in
£625,000. That was at the beginning of
1948. What it has cost since is anybody’s
guess, but a fair idea can be got from
the 1950-51 report, just tabled in Queens-
land Parliament.
In the three years from 1948 to 1951
the project sold 14,432 cattle and 1123
pigs— not to Britain, but on Queensland
markets. It had managed to send 36,000
tons of sorghum to Britain. To do this it
has 130 farm-tractors, eight “construc-
tion” tractors, 130 ploughs, 137 combines,
106 headers and 111 motor-trucks and
cars. The labor force isn’t mentioned.
It had lost £568,300 in the three years,
most of it on sorghum-growing (£245,077).
Its cattle venture made £12,697 at a time
when cattle prices were at their top.
Now, not knowing what to do with it,
the sponsors propose to call in a panel
of “food-production experts” to advise as
to whether it should continue, be formed
into a co-operative, or the area cut up
into farms and given to private farmers.
Naturally, its Socialist sponsors blame
droughts, frosts, rains and so forth for
the failure, though ordinary farms seem
to survive that sort of thing. If Premier
Gair is wise he will urge that the area
be cut up into private farms, the equip-
ment sold, and the whole thing wound up.
Safe as Houses (Upper).
Nearly six months have passed since
North Sydney’s Mr. Geraghty announced
that he intended to introduce into the
N. S. Wales Assembly a motion for the
abolition of the Legislative Council, yet
the “perambulating corpses” of the Upper
House—the phrase was originated by
John Verran, Premier of South Australia
when the “Labor” movement and Jim
Geraghty were both very young—are still
perambulating from bar to Chamber and
enjoying all the privileges and perks per-
taining to their office, including the gold-
pass which was originally designed as a
rail- or tram-ticket, but which now
apparently is also a passport into the
Stadium, the dogs and the neddies.
For much of that time, of course.
Parliament has been in recess and
Geraghty in Honolulu; but those two
ingredients of the political pie being now
reunited it is surely time for the latter to
carry opt his threat and endeavor to
reduce the former from its present bi-
cameral shape to the single-chambered
form which, according to the printed
platform of the A.L.P., is nearer to
“Labor’s” heart’s desire.
A.W.U. leader Dougherty recently
attacked the N. S. Wales A.L.P. for not
making any attempt to carry out this
plank of the party platform, and other
critics have suggested that if the position
is that “Labor” can’t abolish the Council
when out of office and won’t abolish it
when in, then it is time it wiped all re-
ference to the matter out of its platform.
“Labor”-boss Ferguson, at variance
with Dougherty on this as on several
other matters, has stated bluntly that the
party has no intention of interfering with
the Council at present. He has worked
it out that even if “Labor” loses control
of the Assembly at the next election it
will still have a majority in the Council
and he claims that it will be the duty of
this majority to look after the interests of
the party. He doesn’t put it exactly like
that—the line is something about safe-
guarding the progressive legislation
achieved under the McKell and McGirr
Governments—but the meaning is clear.
In the days when abolition of Upper
Houses was written into the “Labor”
platform stalwarts of the party used to
proclaim that Legislative Councillors
were in Parliament for the sole purpose of
looking after their vested interests. In
the Ferguson view that is still the func-
tion of “Labor” M.L.C.’s—they are there
to look after the vested interests of the
A.L.P.
But there is more to it than that.
“Labor” M.L.Cs., most of them trade-
union secretaries and either members or

reluctant to say goodbye to aU that, just
because the party platform didn
far enough ahead. Yet Ferguson doesn t
seem to be panicking, or even unduly per-
turbed at the Geraghty threat, and ms
attitude presumably reflects ramy
accurately that of his colleagues. w eu,
after all, the A.L.P. executive has known
Mr. Geraghty a long time.
POLITICAL POINTS
“Labor’s” sudden concern for British
industry, running counter to the whole
history of the party, is only explainable
by the Evatt formula that everything the
Government does must be wrong. Natu-
rally, a cut in imports of the dimensions
announced must hit British industry.
Menzies admitted this while regretting
the necessity, but both the Chancellor of
the Exchequer and the President of the
Board of Trade have accepted the Aus-
tralian Government’s move as being an
outcome of the lanuary decision that each
sterling-area country should try to live
within its income.
Predictions that the States will be
asked to cut their loan programmes next
financial year have been received with
expressions of pained surprise, the loud-
est howls coming as usual from New
South Wales and Victoria. The pain may
be genuine but the surprise can’t be. With
export-income falling and the knowledge
that this year’s loan tally was straining
the market to the limit it must have been
obvious to every Treasurer that next
year’s askings would have to be more
modest. Yet it’s a safe bet that every one
of them took last year’s figures as a base-
line which could be only altered
upwards.
Excluded from most sports-grounds
around Sydney because of its undoubted
Communist origin, the so-called Youth
Carnival for Peace and Friendship man-
aged, after a court appeal, to secure a
ground near Liverpool for its opening.
Despite its sponsors’ claims that it was
not a Communist show the highlight of
the peaceful gathering was the ejection of
a group of Russian migrants calling
themselves the Free Russian Partisans of
Peace, who attempted to distribute anti-
communist leaflets. Now if the carni-
valians were telling the truth in court the
interlopers can’t have been thrown out
for their politics and it couldn’t have
been for advocating peace. Perhaps they
weren’t youthful enough.
There was another carnival-inspired
ejection movement on Sunday at a con-
vention of the Clerks’ Union at Teachers’
Federation building in Sydney. The busi-
ness of the meeting was ostensibly to
discuss industrial matters, but most of the
time was devoted to the screening of films
of the Warsaw “peace” convention and
the Berlin “Youth Festival.” Ten
“moderate” delegates were refused ad-
mission on technical grounds, and when
the true purpose of the meeting became
known about 50 others walked out. It
should interest N. S. Wales teachers and
the parents of those whom they teach to
know that the federation’s building is
being used day and night for this phony
“peace” stunt.
Opposition-leader Treatt’s motion of
no-confidence in the McGrrrrr Govern-
ment for its handling (or mishandling) of
the transport problem was defeated by
47 votes to 46, McGrrnr’s maGeraghty
of one having decided to remain loyal
to the hand that bit him.
Some time ago five Liberal members
representing North-Shore seats drafted a
letter to the Premier asking him to defer
proposed changes in ferry- and bus-
services until they had been fully dis-
cussed in Parliament. They invited
Geraghty, who represents North Sydney,
to add his signature to theirs. Geraghty
was at the time on board the Aorangi,
about to sail for Honolulu to commune
with himself amid the leis and
ukeleles on whether or not to carry out
his oft-repeated threat to vote against the
Government. He signed the letter, but
when Treatt’s motion came up last week
he helped the Government gag it when
only two of the five Liberal signatories
had spoken.
The McGrrrrrs still have Geraghty’s
Abolish - the - Legislative - Council threat
hanging over them, but on his past record
they’ve no need to worry over that.
Two other would-be resigners changed
their minds last week —Federal Libs.
Falkinder and McColm decided that
second thoughts were best. Words are
unpalatable things to swallow, and wise
people don’t put themselves in the posi-
tion of having to tackle such a diet.
A.L.P. president Jacky Ferguson (“the
thoughtful”) putting on his James-act
again in comment on the Commonwealth
Government’s import restrictions:
What popularity the Government might
have had before these latest import restric-
tions has gone.
It is only a short time since he charged
“Labor” politicians with being a mob of
popularity-hunters, and said that if
“Labor” were in office at Canberra it
would have to do just what the Menzies
Government is doing.
It is seriously suggested from Can-
berra that the Federal Government may
ask Australians to have an “occasional
meatless day” in order to make more
meat available for export to Britain.
Before the Government does that it
should find out just how much prime
beef is fed to racing greyhounds each
week. Mr. Townley, die Minister for
Social Services, says that in Tasmania
alone it rims into 33,0001 b. a week—that’s
equivalent to 40 prime-bullocks.
Economist Colin Clark on the Wheat
Board;
Yet these same wheatgrowers are com-
pelled by Commonwealth legislation to sell
all their wheat through a board which
makes them wait interminably for the pay-
ments to which they are entitled, and docks
a large part of their proceeds in order to
supply the Australian city dweller with
wheat
But, Mr. Clark, have you forgotten
that the wheatgrowers themselves asked
for that legislation by free ballot? The
legislation which “compels” them was
enacted at their own request.
Conciliation Commissioner Galvin is
sticking to his guns on the question of
“margins.” Last Thursday he refused to
consider six disputes arising from pro-
test strikes against his earlier refusal to
grant increased marginal-rates to metal-
trade workers. He said that the strikes
were designed to enforce demands for
rates higher than those he had granted in
his recent award. That award was for a
period of one year, and as far as he was
concerned it would stand for that time.
Mr. Galvin told union representatives
that the fact that the Findlay award
granted increased margins to a small
number of men in Canberra made no
difference to his own award, as he dis-
agreed “both with that decision and the
reasons for it.” He suggested that this
conflict of views between conciliation
commissioners showed the necessity for
some provision to be made for an appeal
to the Arbitration Court in such cases.
The industrial conference on hours and
wages called by Chief ludge Kelly, of
the Arbitration Court, after meeting for
short sessions at long intervals since last
November, is reported to be running into
a breakdown because employees and
union delegates are being disturbed by
rows outside over marginal-rate awards.

PRODUCE—OR PERISH.
Australia at present faces a
situation in which there is the
possibility that efforts to work
our way out of a slump in pro-
ductivity will not be tackled
wholeheartedly. Seeking noth-
ing but office and power to im-
plement the Socialist State (with
all the racketeering that goes
with it), Parliamentary “Labor”
is working to defeat the efforts
of present private-enterprise
Governments.
The Federal Government in
particular is saddled with a
Socialist-created heritage of
overloaded public offices and a
demoralised trade-union move-
ment, Industry has been gravely
weakened. Costs have soared
and are still soaring. The only
ultimate answer to our problems
is much harder productive work
by a greater number of people.
Will the people as a whole have
the commonsense and staying-
power to stick out the first pain-
ful year or two of retrenchment,
restriction and industrial re-
habilitation?
Whatever faults there may be
in the Federal Government’s
plan to deal with inflation and
an excess of imports at the same
time, spiteful, wanton and irre-
sponsible criticism from the
‘'Labor” side and from
interested parties should be
heavily discounted.
Australia’s chief difficulty at
the present time is that it is not
producing enough essentials.
For that failure “Labor”-party
policy is largely to blame, though
opportunist employers have
something to answer for also.
And the Press, especially the
Sydney daily Press, has given no
commonsense leadership to the
mass of the community. It is a
sensational,, frequently irre-
sponsible, Press almost without
exception,
Australia’s position must be
considered as a grave case of
parasitic self-exhaustion.
Politically it is self-indulgent
and lethargic. It is a
sucker for the something-
for-nothing politico-economic
trick. It has very little com-
munity spirit except when times
get really bad, when it can
accomplish splendid things. It
makes great demands of its
political leaders, but is cynical
of their achievements and cares
nothing for their problems. And
it gives little heed to the con-
stitutional difficulties which con-
front a Federal Government
trying to do anything at all not
on the regular programme.
To get out of our troubles we
must produce a great deal more
per head of most things. Our
production efforts must start
with coal and food. Our trans-
port industries must be made to
operate more efficiently both for
the internal carriage of goods
and for the development of an
export trade. The Federal Gov-
ernment can deal with these
problems only in a general way
—mostly a financial way. To
tackle coal and transport
problems it needs the full and
sincere co-operation of the State
Governments —chiefly the N. S.
Wales Government. Instead of
co-operation, a studied policy of
obstruction is what the McGirr
Government has offered.
For some reason by no means
plain the Federal Government
was denied powers to deal with
the Communists. But it has
gone ahead in a workmanlike
way and amended the Common-
wealth Arbitration Act to give
Communist-ridden unions the
secret ballot, with the healthy
results already shown in the case
of the Federated Ironworkers’
Association, formerly Reddest of
the Red. Its Ministers are up
against the vested interests of
the Communists, “L abo r”
pressure-groups, socialistically-
minded bureaucrats, and some-
times shortsighted employer and
rural interests.
A programme of government
approved by the people at the
1949 election was blocked by a
“Labor”-dominated Senate for
16 months. Since then the
McGirr “Labor” Government in
N. S. Wales has taken over
virtually where the Senate left
off.
A state of chaos lies ahead of
Australia unless the Menzies
Government checks inflation and
increases the production of
essential goods in this country to
a marked degree. The Menzies
Government will not succeed in
its efforts unless it gets the back-
ing and co-operation of the
majority of the community. The
alternative to the Menzies Gov-
ernment is the Evatt Socialist
Government, with its McGirr
associate, and both with their
near-Oommunist trade-union
dictators.
The Menzies Government has
pledged its support to private
enterprise. Private enterprise
will have to learn to help rational
government, whether it be of the
Menzies brand or any other
kind. But a great deal more
thought will have to be given to
the economics of private enter-
prise in this queer age if, in
spite of all championship, it is
not to break down through the
insidious undermining which in-
flation and the Welfare State
have brought about.
The Welfare State that was
founded by the Socialists and per-
force continued by the Liberals
has been paid for to the greatest
extent by industry and the
middle-classes. For the past 13
years the profits of industry have
been controlled by the Prices
people, though wages since the
war have been unpegged and
allowed to soar to whatever an
employer could be coerced into
paying. The result has been that
money-profits of industry have
by no means increased in pro-
portion to the rise in money-
wages, and industry has suffered
many disabilities as a result. It
has not, for instance, been
possible to turn profits back into
a business on the pre-war scale
for the purpose of extending
operations. Depreciation pro-
visions have not kept place with
replacement-costs. And investors
have had a shabby return on
their money when their dividends
are compared with trade-
unionists’ wages. (This is more
particularly so in the case of in-
vestments made before World
War II began.)
The cut-up of the post-war
national income has not favored
private enterprise, or any form
of productive enterprise for that
matter. Government industrial
undertakings, notably the rail-
ways, are in a run-down con-
dition. The post-office, too,
complains of many disabilities.
The reason for the deteriora-
tion of our industrial and
essential services has been the
fall in productivity per head and
the greater consumption per
head of the population. Not
enough of our diminished pro-
ductive effort is going into
factories, power-stations, trans-
port facilities, dams and hydro-
electric schemes. The public,
even if it has been earning its
living for the past six years
(which is highly debatable), has
been doing so by wearing-out
existing tools and machinery and
not making adequate provision
for their replacement, let alone
additions to them.
For a few years Australians
have been encouraged to live at
a feckless rate by reason of the
high income we were receiving
abroad for our wool. It enabled
us to buy from abroad an
enormous quantity of goods.
But wool and other export prices
are down now, and for the past
eight months we have been
bringing in huge quantities of
consumer goods and machinery
to a value far in excess of what
we were getting abroad for our
exports. We were able to do so
only because of credits pre-
viously established out of high-
priced exports. Not before it
was time, the Menzies Govern-
ment has decided that we must
live within our current income,
and all imports have been
drastically cut.
It is unfortunate that this jolt
had to come, but without greater
productivity, especially of food,
it was unavoidable. At present
food is in great world-wide
demand, but Australia is no
longer an abundant producer of
food.
The reserves of imported
goods that have been an embar-
rassment in Australia for some
time will cushion the effects of
import-restriction for several
months at least. But after they
have gone, unless our production
for export is increased and
world prices at least remain
stable, we can expect some re-
duction in our standard of liv-
ing. This reduction will be
severer still if our production
for home consumption is not
augmented.
Though a general policy of
import-restriction is now in
force, every effort should still be
made to bring to Australia
essential plant and machinery,
such as power-generating equip-
ment, in order to stimulate local
output to its maximum capacity.
We shall be wanting more coal
than ever now, and it remains to
be seen in this respect what the
reaction of the Communist-run
unions and the McGirr Govern-
ment will be.
It would seem that a restric-
tion of imports would call for
an easing of credit-restrictions
by the Commonwealth Bank.
But any easing would again be
confined to essential industry,
since basic industries will have
heavier demands made on them
than ever now that fewer over-
seas supplies will be avilable.
and manpower will need to be
taken from non-essential in-
dustry on a greater scale than
was previously thought to be
necessary.
Financial policy on its own
will achieve very little, though it
can be made into a powerful in-
dustrial persuading factor, and
it is one of the very few which
the Commonwealth (as distinct
from the States) possesses. Man-
power position should be con-
stantly reviewed, with unusual
attention to employees in Gov-
ernment departments. And the
gross and all-too-obvious
obstruction of various “market-
ing boards” and similar bodies
should be made the subject of a
very businesslike royal commis-
sion.
Melting-pot
In the economic melting-pot
last week:
The Federal Government decided
to raise the land-tax exemption limit
from £5OOO to £8750 and abolish
super-tax on valuations above
£20,000. Provisional-tax on wool-
growers will be modified immediately
because of the steep fall in wool
prices.
The restriction of imports, with
threatened scarcity of various lines
of clothing, has upset some State
plans for decontrol of textile prices.
Mr. Eugene Black, president of the
International Bank, here to decide
whether Australia should get another
loan, was reported to
be “impressed” by the Federal Gov-
ernment’s plans to increase produc-
tion.
Proceeds of wool sales during
eight months to February 29 at
£222 million compared with £435 mil-
lion from rather more bales in the
same period of 1950-51.
Cabinet talks on the easing of
credit restrictions appeared to have

From Herbert Holman
The repercussions of the
Socialists’ motion of censure on
Mr. Churchill’s speech to
Congress have been loud and
prolonged. Comment, except
from defenders of the Labor
faith, has unanimously deplored
the motives behind the vote of
censure and acclaimed the Old
Man’s decisive hard-hitting. As
there is no ready armor against
public slander, such as the
widely-provoked allegations of
warmongering which so dis-
figured the general election and
cost Mr. Churchill’s party so
many votes, it was no less than
just that he should turn the
tables against his traducers with
such cruel force. For his dis-
closure that Messrs. Attlee and
Morrison not only had agreed
to associate themselves with
“action not confined to Korea,”
but also had approved the pro-
duction in Britain of atomic
bombs, is as much an exposure
of their own duality of purpose
as it is a discomfiture to their
mixed bag of back-benchers.
The picture, broadly, is that
Mr. Churchill, free in his own
party from disunity and com-
petition for leadership, is able
to sustain a war on two fronts.
He must strive to lead the
British people out of an
economic tight corner, and at
the same time be prepared
against unremitting attacks from
his political opponents aimed to
belittle his stature as a general
and to discredit his successes.
Mr. Attlee, on the other hand,
has sought to run with the hare
of diplomatic counsel and ride
with the hounds of narrow poli-
tical prejudice. When in office
he managed to keep up with the
hare, but now he’s well behind
the hounds.
Opinions vary as to the posi-
tion of Mr. Bevan in this
undignified scramble. He
has advantages denied to
“moderates” such as Messrs.
Attlee, Morrison and Gaitskell
in that, while they may be pre-
sumed to know the true state of
affairs, his political outlook is
handicapped by no such draw-
back. The Conservatives are
believed not to overrate his bid
for leadership, on the grounds
that it is his influence rather
than his power which is grow-
ing : that, if he were dramatically
to assume the highest position
in his party he would just as
dramatically fall from it some
months later. The distressing
feature, as noted by such respon-
sible opinion as the Times” and
the “Manchester Guardian,” is
that the leaders of the Labor
party are reduced to half-hearted
imitation of him.
Certainly, the destructive
attitude of the Opposition
deserves mention for a “double”
of astonishing paradoxity, for
its vote of censure has given a
great deal of air, if not weight,
to the views of Senator Taft,
while its persistent boosting of
the class-war and “wicked Tory”
myth has at the same time helped
the Communists to make trouble
in the coalfields.
Australians and Music
It is often said, with justifica-
tion, that Australians know more
about the Old Country than
Britons know about Australia.
But Britons have lately been
hearing, with amazement and
something of the genuine respect
that, for example, might have
attended a talk on cricket by
Sir Don Bradman, of the
musical-consciousness of Aus-
tralian audiences. We have
heard Mr. Arthur Benjamin
outline the extension of the
orchestral repertoire during the
40-odd years since he left Sydney
as a boy of 15, when Mendel-
ssohn was considered a contem-
porary composer; and we have
heard so internationally-
experienced a conductor as Mr.
Eugene Goossens pay eloquent
tribute both to the skill of per-
formers and to the discernment
of listeners.
Add to these encouraging
testimonies the better-known
fact that Australians in Britain
are to be found in musical life,
especially singing, out of all
proportion to the population of
their country, and it seems
natural enough that the newly-
formed Australian Musical
Association (in London) should
have aroused the wide interest
that it has.
Lack of space precludes the
mention of the many distin-
guished musicians who are con-
nected with the A.M.A., and of
the Australian composers whose
works we heard performed by
Australian artists at the London
Contemporary Music Centre,
The main objects of the associa-
tion are to promote Australian
music and to publicise the work
of her composers and musicians.
Another aim of great practical
importance is the establishment
of an advisory bureau of infor-
mation which will include
hospitality and give an eye to
the welfare of new arrivals.
Since making one’s way in music
is harder even than in other
arts, the young Australian who
seeks advancement in the musical
centres of Europe will rightly be
relieved of the heart-breaking
agony of being alone, unknown
and uncared-for in a big city.
If he—or she —has the ability
and the capacity to work, a
service second to none in the
range and authority of its advice
will be on hand.
The founder and honorary
secretary of the association is
the 28-year-old composer Don
Banks, of Melbourne, whose duo
for violin and ’cello has won the
Edwin Evans prize, and is to
represent Australia at this year’s
Salzburg Festival.
Bristol Cream
A two-week presentation at
the Old Vic. of “The Two
Gentlemen of Verona” has set
tongues a-flutter both before
and behind the curtain. Here is
a company of a round score of
players whose names are
unknown outside the profession.
Yet without a single star to
enhance the cast the reserve-
team from Bristol has not only
given London the first public
performance of this early
comedy since 1910, but has also
acted its august senior right off
the stage.
If reasons are sought, they
would seem to lie in team-
work and in production. At any
rate, a cast whose average
standard of competency falls
short of almost any West End
Shakspearian company has
shown that, in concert, it can
carry away into poetic fantasy
audiences who are all-too-inured
to polite attention. The pro-
ducer, Denis Carey, is also
director of the Bristol Old Vic.,
and has followed simple, tradi-
tional lines, keeping close to the
spirit of Shakspeare, a habit not
general among many of our
leading London producers.
whose virtuosity so often runs
away with them.
If Mr. Carey has not kept to
the script (he adds a male voice
trio, a girl with a guitar, a game
of chess, a song from “The
Merchant of Venice” and others
from outside Shakspeare) at least
he never allows his innovations
to seem incongruous.
As to the play itself, cold
analysis only points to absurdity.
Not until the end of Act II does
the action begin to grip. One
of the two gentlemen, Valentine,
is a plausible idealist, while the
other, Proteus, is balefully
treacherous. When he finds
Proteus out, Valentine castigates
him as the foulest of villains and
15 seconds later pours vows of
pure friendship upon him. Ban-
dits speak poetry and the
essentially Elizabethan humor
has some coarse patches. There
was also a dog which, so far
from being “the sourest-
natured.... that lives,” is all
licking devotion. But the per-
formance, charged as it was by
flashes of poetry and stylised
make-believe, brought more than
credulity to these improba-
bilities ; it turned them into en-
chantment.
Since many of the parts are in-
consistent, changing in character
between beginning and end, the
actors’ task is not easy. But it is
interesting to notice the strip-
ling Shakspearians who later
were called upon to take better
shape. There’s a bit of Theseus,
of lago, of Viola and of
Rosalind. An exchange of rings
precurses Bassanio’s embarrass-
ment at Belmont. And Julia is
the first one of those principal
“girls” who so undeceivingly
assume male clothing half-way
through.


Society
AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS'
“Caballer”: Reading that the Diggers
embarking for Korea were treated to
an address by a politician I recalled the
time one of the breed addressed us in
Flanders in 1916. Under the elms behind
him was what appeared to be a centuries-
old cottage of mellow red brick covered
“You Would pick Anzac Day!”
with ivy and roofed with moss-covered
tiles. He pointed it out as a specimen of
the type of countryside we had come to
save. The troops grinned, knowing it
was a camouflaged gun-position cover-
ing a 15in. howitzer that took occasional
shots at a railway-junction 20 miles away.
The grins widened when the roof of a
lean-to on the house lifted noiselessly, dis-
closing the grim 15jn. muzzle pointing to
the sky. We set our teeth to stand the
hellish roar we knew would come. The
great man had got to the part where he
“was proud of our steel-like nerves that
braved an inferno of flame and noise,”
when a sheet of flame tore into the sky
and a sound like unto Lone Pine and
Judgment Day rolled into one seemed to
shatter the earth. I’ve been told that
15in. howitzer shells rise three miles high
before they start to come down. The
speechifier must have come pretty close
to beating that.
* * * *
“Kelms”: An event that won’t be
affected by the accession of Queen
Elizabeth is the annual eight-oar race
known as the King’s Cup. It’ll retain that
title, since it was donated by King
George V after an A.I.F. crew had a win
on the Thames in 1919.
* * * *
“Youanmi”: The only reason I
frequent pubs comes out of barrels ; but,
over the years, I have not been unaware
of the vituperation hurled at Australian
hotels in general and, in particular, at the
standards of accommodation and meals
provided by them. It gives me great
pleasure, therefore, to rise and affirm that
I had bed-and-breakfast at a pub within
100 miles of Sydney the other day ; that
the service was excellent almost to the
point of being overpowering; and that
the proverbial arms of Morpheus had
nothing on my bed. The only difficulty
arose at breakfast when, after porridge
that would have satisfied my Scottish
ancestors, I had some difficulty in decid-
ing between lamb’s-fry and bacon, bacon
and eggs or steak and eggs. “Which do
you recommend?” I asked the chirpy
lass with the tray. “Just you leave it to
me,” she said, and returned a couple of
minutes later with a large plate smothered
with lamb’s-fry, bacon, two eggs and hot
vegetables. Then, having set that plateful
in front of me, she put down before it a
silver dish holding a lovely hunk of steak
and two more eggs. There was no extra
charge, and, for a suitable consideration.
I’ll name the pub.
* * * *
“Bass”: The recent “eviction” strike
by Fremantle watersiders was staged
after a “unanimous” decision by the
union members, all of whom were
incensed at the action of a rapacious
landlord in evicting tenants who were
members of the union, and all of whom
were thinking solely of the evictees.
Until the “West Australian” revealed that
a number of lumpers had also taken out
eviction orders against tenants —one
watersider had actually evicted another
member of his union! Capping that,
someone further pointed out that had the
strikers really wanted to assist the evicted
tenants they could have all worked on
the Sunday—at penalty rates —and with
the money thus earned they could have
bought good houses in salubrious suburbs
for all the evicted families in the case.

“The Missus”: Early in the war I
packed my nine-months-old baby into a
Moses basket, stowed the basket in the
car and set out on an 1100-mile drive
to spend two or three weeks in a town
near which my husband’s unit was
stationed. I travelled at a comfortable
speed, taking three days over the trip and
sleeping and eating at hospitable pubs.
Twice I answered friendly policemen who
wanted to know why an apparently un-
attached female with infant was driving
herself through unfamiliar territory. I
even called at the border-town police-
station to make sure I could cross the
dividing-line without a special permit. At
dusk on the third day I reached my
destination and asked a gigantic Irish
“Shut the drawer and let’s listen to Jack Davey
policeman’s advice as to hostelries. He
put me through the usual catechism,
directed me to an hotel and arrived very
shortly afterwards to tell me that my
husband’s unit had been unexpectedly
sent on final leave four days before. With
his help and that of the kindly Bung I
cashed a cheque and set off home again
next morning. In the meantime my
husband had arrived home the day after
I left and had hastened to the police,
They were interested in his story, were
sorry for him, but could do nothing to
help. No, they couldn’t send word to
police along the route to turn me back.
They could have me intercepted if e
hked to lay a charge against me
perhaps he could claim I d stolen his car?
Oh, it was registered in our joint names?
That was out then. Perhaps I d abducted
S e „ ba^? That WaS J° mt to °;
Wei! they were sorry but they just
couldnt help So I had the long drive
there and back, arriving home fagged out
and with three days wasted .. . all because

“Charbro”: Once took two of my
youngsters to the museum of Nelson
relics housed at Monmouth in the west of
England. We were looking at some of
Nelson’s letters, framed and hung, when
six-year-old Robert said “Not bad writ-
ing, Dad, because he had only his left
hand to write with.” The observation
shook me ; despite the hundreds of repre-
sentations of Nelson I had seen, never
had the question as to which arm he had
lost even entered my head. A year later
I was looking at items of Nelsoniana in
the British Museum when an American
remarked to his friend “A pretty poor
fist he wrote!” I couldn’t resist it; with
inward apologies to my absent youngster
I said : “But don’t forget he had only
his left hand to write with.”

“Archaen”: Can’t agree with “Clooter”
(B 30/1/’52) when he describes King
Solomon as “Not much more than a
desert sheik and Israel about as powerful
„ the Aruntas are today." TTre work
of the archaeologists has revealed that
rulers like Sol. lived in a barbaric splendor
which also had quite a lot of luxury, while
some of the arts had reached a high
plane. In Ur of the Chaldees, where
Abraham was born, Sir Leonard Woolley
uncovered the burial-place of one of
Solomon’s contemporaries. Some 50
palace guards, musicians and court ladies
had been killed and buried with him,
and the gold ornaments worn by some
of those women were valuable by any
standard. The golden dagger found in
another tomb is regarded as one of the
greatest art treasures of any period. The
excavation of the Ziggurat at Ur reveals
it as a great and imposing building; if
Solomon’s temple had been only a
quarter of the size, it would still be
something to write home about. Excava-
tions show that in that portion of the
earth was born one of our first civilisa-
tions, with cities in which many people
were literate, while trading vessels and
caravans brought goods from places as
far afield as India and the south-eastern
coast of Africa. To judge by the defer-
ence paid him by contemporary rulers,
King Sol. wasn’t small potatoes by any
means.

CHANGE OF HEART.
“Surgeons at Pennsylvania Hospital kept a man
alive for an hour and 20 minutes with a mechanical
Yrart.”
I gave my love my heart;
It was not hard at all
For it and me to part:
It was mechanical.
And lest the world declare
Me heartless by this deed,
I bought myself a spare
To serve in case of need.
Thus voiding poets’ lies:
Their dying by the pen
On losing hearts; those eyes
That steal hearts back again.
No theft nor felo-de-se
Occurred to her or me;
We watched our hearts at play
From my love’s settee:
Two hearts that beat as one —
But not because ’twas fated;
Those casual days are gone—
We’d had them regulated.
AH night till almost dawn
We’d watch them pulse sedately,
And sometimes she would yawn:
“Seen any pictures lately?”
Or she might interrupt
Some point I was enlarging,
Incisive and abrupt:
“Your batteries need charging!”
It’s strange, but also true,
I found the game a bore;
She must have felt so, too;
She turned me from her door.
I did not weep or wail;
I did not rage or burn;
But by the morning’s mail
1 asked my heart’s return.
The words she then let fall
Were words of deep dejection;
“I’ve pawned your heart, and all
Your pledges of affection.”
The pawnbroker said “Yes ;
I have your loving token,
Though, sir, I must confess
The heart is badly broken.
“The lady must have bashed it;
No glue could mend or seam it —
Look! Here and here she’s smashed it;
But if you like, redeem it.”
I said, “I have another
And well run-in, inside,
And so I wouldn’t bother
Except ... I have my pride;
“So wrap it up, quick-smart.
I’ll keep it by, to prove
I really had a heart,
And it could break for love.”

“Caston”: So John Casson, speaking
of the co-operation of playwright, pro-
ducer, actors and management, said that
the association was not always a happy
one for the playwright, “whose play must
of necessity be subject to numerous
changes” (B. 27/2/’52),. I need mention
only Pinero and Shaw, with whom I had
the privilege of being associated in a
humble way, to refute this youthful
remark. It would have been an experi-
ence to be remembered to have heard any
producer suggest the alteration of a
phrase to either of those playwrights,
and there are others of whom the same
could be said, Casson’s father. Sir Lewis,
could enlighten him from his own experi-
ence when producing Priestley’s “I’ve
Been Here Before” at the Royalty
Theatre.

“A.E.S.”: The fop who used such
polite language to the murderer (B.
20/2/’52) reminded me of the yarn told
by an electrical contractor in England:
An old lady complained to him about the
language used by some of his men work-
ing on a job outside her house. He
tackled the men ; they indignantly denied
the charge. Jack told him; “I was up
the ladder, pouring hot bitumen in the
joint-box and I accidentally dropped some
down Bill’s neck while he was holding
the ladder. Bill yelled out ‘You really
should be more careful. Jack.’ ”

“Brick E,”: I suppose it’s asking too
much to expect veracity in a newspaper
blurb-article, but when a paper old
enough to know better denotes a big
lump of its Saturday magazine to prov-
ing that writing can be nothing more nor
less than an athletic feat, I become
restive. The hero of the gush “doesn’t
employ a secretary, because only a battery
of stenographers could keep up with his
dictation for more than an hour at a
time.” So he “roughly types” his efforts
on a “hard-pressed typewriter” —at the
breakneck speed of 3000 words in a
“After you. Captain. I'd like to finish this chapter .”
morning that begins at 7 a.m. and ends
at lunch-time. About five hours; an
average of something like 10 words a
minute! Rather a poor performance
from a man who “talks and moves at
roughly three times the speed of the
average citizen.” The author spends his
spare time in “swimming or boxing or
riding—any sport that is violent enough
to drain off his surplus energy.” And
yeit “on the beach at Bondi his tan out-
glows that of the lifesavers.” There is
only one way to get an all-over color like
that—and it’s not by using up energy:
it’s acquired by lazing in the sun for
hours. Still, apparently the chap does
turn out 20,000 marketable words a week
—which fact may be handy for me.
Next time a writer friend jeers at my
physical inability to lay 800 bricks a day
on face work, I’ll mention this and watch
how quality suddenly becomes more
important than quantity.

“Henman”: Touching human tempera-
tures, I once saw 130 degress notched.
Sister’s reaction was to ring immediately
for the M. 0., who was all but apoplectic
when he arrived, having been dragged
away from an interesting game of table-
tenms. It didn’t take him long to solve
the mystery. He indulged in some
vitriolic remarks about the gullible
qualities of nurses in general, and of this
one in particular ; after which he ordered
her to “shake the damn’ thing down, take
another reading, and remove the
of coffee out of reach of the patient. ’

“5 G.R.”: The Indian Army has its
rightful place among gallant corps in
history, but there were always a few bat-
talions kept in being for political pur-
poses. One was sent to Persia with my
mob, and when the honors and awards
list came out, the Old Man swooned.
His battalion of Gurkhas got nothing j
the political battalion got the lot. “Hell! ”
he spat. “Subedar Major gets the Indian
Order of Merit; an extra pension. He
had forty-years’ service, was almost stone-
deaf, and when the first shot was fired
he didn’t hear it. He continued to attack,
while the battalion bolted.”
* * * *
“Rooster”: During the war recruiting-
depots must have relaxed their standards
at times ; there were numerous examples
of men with obvious physical defects
being classified Al. In our unit there
was one such. He had a glass-eye, but
it didn’t prevent him from earning an
M.M. in the islands. There was another
chap, afflicted with the stammers. How
he got by we’ve never found out. But
he was finally the victim of his own
stuttering. The stretcher-bearers dis-
covered him lying in a foxhole after the
initial box-on at Milne Bay. He wasn’t
hit; just lost. His attempts to stutter a
satisfactory explanation were taken as
symptoms of shell-shock, and the further
back he was carried the more painfully
difficult to interpret his stammering
became. He finally arrived at the Towns-
ville A.G.H., where the error was laid
bare. Much to his disgust he got a base-

“Cupid”: A serial novel was recently
written with chalk on the footpaths of
our suburb. It began with the drawing
of a heart with an arrow through it and
the legend “J.S. loves 8.D.” That went
on for a few chapters. Then someone,
possibly a rival for B.D.’s favors, began
to alter the script by rubbing out the
“loves 8.D.” and writing “Is Mad.” J.S.
restored the original lettering ; the rival
again erased “8.D.” and substituted
“Himself.” That, I thought, was rather
neat. J.S., his ardour unquenched, came
at it again. His hearts, his inscriptions,
his arrows dripping blood, would have
touched any fickle girl’s feelings. The
footpaths were splashed with his avowals:
“J.S. loves 8.D.” B.D.’s other admirer
evidently considered it time to take
stronger measures. He rubbed out the
latter half of the declaration, and made
all the inscriptions read: “J.S. will get
bashed.” That ended it. J.S. could evi-
dently recognise a warning when he saw
one.
“Villefair”: Our grocer has introduced
an innovation to his customers. Every
“regular” is issued with an order-book
—the familiar, double-paged grocers’
docket-book, complete with carbon-sheet.
“The customers write the weekend order
themselves,” explained the shopman,
“They’ve got all the week to jot down
what they want; the consequence is
nothing is forgotten. Then, when the
order-man does the rounds they just tear
“Cocktail-parties are such fun. Colonel."
out the double page, and he brings the
order back to be made up. The system
enables the order-collector to get right
around in about half the time he used
to take.” But even the most efficient
system can be sabotaged, A customer
recently asked for another book. “But it’s
only a few weeks since I gave you one ! ”
protested the grocer. “Oh, yes, but it s
all gone” the lady announced cheerily.
“We found it was just the thing to write
the bets on. We give the bookie’s runner
one page and keep the carbon copy. It
saves a ton of wrangles.” It didn’t save
that one!

“Zake”: Her car was wedged in be-
tween two others, with only a couple of
feet at each end for manoeuvring. After
several futile attempts to get out, the in-
evitable Galahad cast up. Stepping off
the footpath he said smilingly: “They
haven’t left you much room, but you can
do it all right.” The harassed lady
looked dubious. • “Do you think so?”
she asked. “Sure. No, come forward
a bit. Whoa! Now back, and swing
quickly on that other lock . . . that’s
enough.” Back and forth she crept under
his guidance, until a confident nod indi-
cated his satisfaction. “You’re right now
—you can come straight out.” She did
and the off-rear bumper-bar of the car
in front put a deep score across her front
near-fender. At the horrible crunch she
stopped, and by the time she had got
out to survey the damage her mentor had
judiciously departed. Then came the
voice of the elderly woman who had been
sitting next to her, in mildly reproachful
tones, “It’s really your own fault, you
know, Betty—-I warned you years ago
never to talk to strange men! ”

“W.P.T.” : Noticing in a suburban
paper an advertisement “Clean horse-
manure for sale,” I inquired about the
adjective, and was told that it meant not
adulterated with shavings, sawdust or
straw. Near me there is a bakery where
a man calls daily with a load of shavings
for the horse-stalls. He supplies this free
in return for the sole rights to the
manure, which he gathers daily and sells
to home gardeners at fancy prices. I’ll
wager the manure he sells is at least 75
per cent, shavings. Would that classify
it as dirty?

“Bad Australian”: Tasmania’s first
land surveys were made with a compass
for taking horizontal angles and a con-
traption known as a measuring-wheel.
The compass was scarcely an instrument
of precision, btit a few minutes’ error in
the reading of an angle was regarded as
negligible, and as the distances recorded
by the wheel were measured in the same
manner over hill and plain the results
must have been a headache for the man
who was required to fit them together in
a plan and compute the area. After an
inspection of the settlements at the
Derwent and Port Dalrymple, Governor
Macquarie reported to the Earl of
Liverpool on November 17, 1812: “The
late Deputy-Surveyor (Mr. Harris) at
Hobart Town was a very Indolent Uis-
sipated Man, and besides he knew very
little of his Duty as a Surveyor. Mr.
Mills, who lately acted as Deputy-
Surveyor at Port Dalrymple, was still
more ignorant of his Duty as a Surveyor
of Lands.” As a result of the incapacity
of the surveyors and the inadequacy ot
their instruments the court at Hobart
Town was rushed with litigants, clamor-
ing for an equitable and proper demarca-
tion of their lands, and this state of affairs
continued until the boundaries of all
alienated lands were revised and adjusted
by competent surveyors.

“Emjai”: Beer-quaffing stunts 18.
13/2/’52) leave me cold and thirsty. I
once refereed a speed contest. With six
champs lined up, on the word “Go” little
Mac threw back his head, opened his
gullet and banged down the empty
schooner on the bar in one motion —no
swallow. Then came a faraway look in
his eyes until he had a quiet follow
through, over which he confided that he
always won. “But,” he added, “it ’urts
like ’ell.” The 50-years’ record of the
Maori who sank 12 pints while the clock
of Wanganui chimed midnight makes me
wonder what he suffered instead of
enjoyed, and watching the six o’clock
swill at a city bar I’m a bit with the chap
who gets delightfully tight drinking a
glass of beer with a teaspoon.

“Metax”: Observation over several
years leads me to infer that morning bus-
travellers are divisible into three types —
those who are always early, those who
always have to run, and the unpredictables
who are sometimes early and sometimes
late. For the championship of the first
type I nominate the lady who joined the
gang a few months ago. Her bus passes
a quarter of an hour after mine, yet she
is an easy winner even on the occasions
when I have arrived kicking myself for
having 12 minutes to spare.

“Ceg”: The wedding presents were
numerous and costly and included quite
a collection of casseroles. After the
newlyweds had the garden well under
way they thought it would be nice to
keep some chooks, so a dozen day-old
chicks were bought. For brooder a suit-
able box was fitted with strips of flannel
inside the lid. Heat was provided by
one of the wedding-present casseroles
filled with hot water; it had to be
replenished every few hours, day and
night, and that became the young wife’s
job. Contraption and wife worked
splendidly and the chicks throve. One
day the donor of the casserole called,
and, after hearing all about the poultry-
farming activities, asked to be shown the
chickens. There was no way out of it:
the lid of the brooder was raised, reveal-
ing to her visitor’s pained gaze her
“lovely” casserole in just the state one
would expect after chickens had been
perching on it for a couple of weeks. 1
wonder if Emily Post has anything to
say on the correct etiquette for such an
occasion.
A HERO’S LAMENT.
I’d like to be as other men
And live the simple life—
Enjoy the quiet of a home
And maybe take a wife.
All these I am denied because
No matter what I do
I find a murder on my hands
A suicide or two.
If I should seek at some weekend
The peace for which I yearn
I’ll chance upon a charnel-house,
And straight away I’ll learn
A brand adorns some fellow-guest
That likens him to Cain,
And in my bed I’ll surely find
A body, newly slain.
My life is just a whirligig
Of unexpected deaths,
Of victims just about to gasp
Their last remaining breaths
Through gunshot wounds or dagger thrusts,
By poison or by drug,
Or even, for variety,
Garrotting by a thug.
Why should such direful deeds be heaped
On my reluctant head?
Why should my ev’ry footstep be
So cluttered up with dead?
Why cannot I escape it all
And into limbo slip?—
Because I am, by destiny,
The hero in a strip.
N-S.W.
DRY SHAVE.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bronzewing”: When Mollison’s
Pyalong station was thrown open for
selection in the ’fifties my father won a
block on the southern boundary, stayed
there a few years and then bought an
adjoining block with a new house on it.
Among the stuff shifted to the new home
was a large wall-clock. It consisted of
a few wheels, a spring and a drum to
wind the gut cord on. The brass ratchet
off the drum was lost between the two
homes. Someone made a ratchet out of
a penny and it did the job well. A short
time ago my son picked up the missing
ratchet in a sheep pad 4in. or sin. under-
ground. He knew where it belonged, and
it is now back in its place, after not doing
a hand’s turn for 74 years, and the clock
keeps better time than the modem ones
about the place. No replacements were
ever put in the works.

“M.U.R.”: Strangest predicament I
ever saw a man in happened to
Ghallagher, down in the Ninety-mile
Bend, River Murray. We’d arranged to
meet him at his camp one Sunday morn-
ing and go spinning in his boat. When
we reached the camp we saw Ghallagher
hanging by his feet from the limb of a
tree, his head about 4ft. from the ground.
We got him down and he explained. “I
got up on the limb t’ see if I could sight

up X lorst me balance. Tried t’ grab the

limb, slipped an’ fell, but managed t’
catch her with me feet. Couldn’t pull

till y’ come.” “But couldn’t y’ have
kicked y’rself free?” “Well, that’s a
funny thing,” Ghallagher said. “Tried it,
but me weight on me feet made it impos-
sible. Never thought of that before, but
that’s how it was.” We thought it over
and Jim went up the tree and hung by
his feet from the same limb and tried
to kick free. H© couldn’t.
“The Missus”: I see hares dancing (?)
(B. 27/2/’52) about the same time every
year—in that half-light which lasts for
half an hour or so at early dawn and
again at dusk just when spring is merging
imperceptibly with summer and again
when autumn is giving way to winter.
My bedroom window looks to the north
and a high hill, steep, rocky and bracken-
clad. The foot of the hill forms a grassy
platform, almost level and ringed round
with ferns and stunted brush. Here the
hares dance. At one moment the little
stage is empty, the next they are there,
leaping, pirouetting and bounding in the
most amazing and intricate series of
figures. I guess it’s courtship ritual,
though three or more take part. There
is not the display and audience of a lyre-
bird’s mating dance, nor is it at all like
the stately and dignified pavane of the
brolgas. It is a wild, abandoned sort of
affair, almost satyr-like in feeling. The
performance lasts a half-hour or so, when
comes a final frenzied leap and suddenly
the stage is bare. I suppose the light is
tricky and magnifies them, but those hares
certainly look larger than any others I’ve
ever seen.

“Mat’s Mate”; Mat was waiting for
me outside the Settlers’ Club in Mildura
when a woman with a baby in a push-
cart hurried up to him, shoved the push-
cart at him, said “Would you mind
minding him for a moment?” and hurried
into the club. The child immediately
started to bawl at the top of its voice.
Mat could only stand there, glaring at
any passer-by who dared look at him.
The mother came back. “Oh,” she
blithered, “what’s wrong with the poor
little thing?” Mat looked at her coldly.
“Well,” he said, “if you don’t know what
the hell he’s goin’ crook about how the
dickens d’ y’ expect me t’ know! I don’t
even know him!”

“Lex”: Some of our scientists ought
to make a closer study of the cicada as
a means of forecasting weather. In a
season favorable to the cicada its life-
cycle is completed in 12 months —egg to
grub to chrysalis to adult insect. But in
a season unfavorable the chrysalis may
remain in the ground for a year or two
years or even more, waiting for the
mysterious signal as to the weather ahead.
I’ve an idea that signal could be identified
by research.
* * ♦ ♦
“Ceg”: “Strawberry,” leading lady in
so many Bulletin yarns and sketches,
probably got her name from strawberry
clover, dear to her palate, and which she
helped to pioneer. The seed was placed
in funnel-shaped bags tied to the necks
of milking cattle. As they moved about
the seed trickled down and was trodden
into the soil by the hooves. This hap-
pened at Tarwin Meadows in South
Gippsland (Vic.), a property acquired by
George Black in 1851. He noticed the
similarity between the swamp-lands he
had reclaimed and land recovered from
the sea in Holland. When the flats were
cleared and drained they were sown with
clovers and English grasses. Of all the
clovers introduced the strawberry proved
the most suitable. Black imported 30cwt.
of the seed from Holland. If any Aboliar
has a better theory as to how “Strawb”
got her name I would be glad to hear it.
“Nanny”: When I lived up north it
was possible to get a herd of goats for
about half-a-crown or five-bob a head,
or even for nothing if one happened to
be about when the periodic round-up of
unregistered animals took place on
Thursday Island. With legs tied ready
for transport to one of the uninhabited
Strait islands they’d be lying on the beach
and you could take your choice. Last
week I had a letter from a northern friend
telling me that nanny is now in “short
supply.” Butchers unable to get beef are
“Look at her ankles !”
killing and serving goat’s meat, and
milkers are sky-high in price. Here in
Tassie a neighbor who brought home a
young milking goat paid over £l7 for it.
Goat-breeding would be a good spec, at
that price.
* * * ♦
“Columba”; Visiting a mountain farm
in s.-e. Queensland, we asked: “Could
you grow wheat here?” “Aw, yes,” the
farmer said; “we gave it a go, but the
cockatoos got it.” “What about barely?”
“Tried that too, but the hares got it.”
A little later: “Will maize do well here?”
“Yes, when we grew that the crows got
it.” “Those vines look well,, anyhow.”
“Yair, but the mickeys’ll get all the
grapes.” However, nothing got his
Illawarra dairy-cows, so I suppose he’ll
pull through.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: With the shearers came
the usual mixed bunch of rousies, includ-
ing the inevitable skite. According to
this cove he’d been everywhere from the
Klondyke to Kalgoorlie, caught whales,
fought Boers, won football premierships,
broke the books, dined with Edward VII
when he was Prince of Wales, knew
Dan Kelly, rode the white bull
through Wagga and all the rest of it.
By night in the hut, where we station-
hands joined the greasies and rousies for
brownie and tea and yams, Blower
monopolised the conversation, until Little
Curl took a hand. Blower, it seems, was
riding on some back-track the other side
of Carson City or some such place, when
he was stuck up by four bandits. He
hit his moke with the spurs and charged
through them and away. But one kept
after him, and Blower led him a
chase up into some hills that hap-
pened to be handy. There, select-
ing a clump of rocks, he jumped off
the prad and waited. “He came racin’
up,” said Blower, “an’ I let him get real
close. Then I drew me pistol” He
paused to give his statement dramatic
effect. “Blimey,” breathed Little Curl,
“don’t tell me there was no water in it.”

“Slot”; The account (B. 20/2/’52) of
the uses to which Chinese have put de-
funct crows as a remedy for sundry dis-
orders recalls a lesson impressed in the
middle ’3os on his fifth year med. students
by a senior honorary physician at a
Sydney hospital. They were to cultivate re-
ceptive minds and be on their guard against
over-confidence in their own infallibility.
By way of illustration he gave them the
history of a patient he had treated for
pernicious anasmia, for which at that time
medical science had no answer. The
patient knew he was doomed but pre-
ferred to die at home. He was accord-
ingly discharged. A year or two later the
doctor was surprised to see the same man
visiting in one of the wards. He spoke
to him. The man said that, willing to try
anything, he visited a Chinese herbalist
and was given a brown powder. The
Chinese told him it was dried crow’s-
liver. The doctor was too polite to ex-
press his derision. “But now,” he told
the studes, “it has been discovered that
the most effective remedy we have against
pernicious anasmia is a diet of prepared
liver. If I had felt a little less superior
at the mention of a Chinese herbalist, the
correct treatment for this complaint might
have been available to the profession
some ten or twenty years sooner.”

“Gascoyne; Re “Nor’-west’s” query on
the life-span of a whale (B. 6/2/’52).
Professor Dakin, after thorough research
into the life-span of “Old Tom,” a well-
known killer-whale in Twofold Bay
(N.S.W.), says; “I unhesitatingly accept
the evidence of Old Tom’s age being 80
years or more.” This whale paid regular
visits to Twofold Bay for close on 80
years, his identity evident because of a
peculiar mark on the front of a fin. So
well-known was Old Tom that at his
death, in September, 1930, his skeleton
was preserved as a relic in a suitable
building in the main street of Eden.

“Brick E.”: When jobs were as scarce
as tradesmen are now, Bob and I arrived
in a strange town looking for toil. “Any-
one want any bricks laid or building-
repairs done around this place, d’ y’
know?” we asked Rip Van Winkle’s elder
brother, who was attached to a form out-
side the pub. “Don’t know as I do,” the
old codger replied, after giving the question
very careful
thought. “Y’
could try
Smithson
he’s the
local
builder; he
might want
some men.
Don’t know
as he does;
don’t know
as he don’t.”
Bob inter-
rupted:
“Where
would we find this bloke?” Whiskers
didn’t approve of the gag being
applied, but he told us: “Let’s
see. You turn down beside the
store and it’s the fourth house on the left.
No, it ain’t, it’s on the right—the sixth
place, I think. Or is it?” But we had
already started. There were 10 houses in
the street; Bob stood in the middle of the
road, sized them up, then, selecting the
third on the right, marched in and con-
fidently asked was Mr. Smithson at home.
He was, and we landed a few days’ work.
To my query, “How did you know
that was his place?” the more observant
Bob merely pointed to the drunken
gate, the rickety fence, the scaling paint
and the broken window-pane. As he
Sherlocked it, nobody but a builder
would have allowed his house to get in
such a state of disrepair.

“Loulalo”: Any Aboliar settle this one
for me? During the near-drought con-
ditions prevailing of late I’ve been draw-
ing water for the fowl-yard and a few
treasured shrubs from an old timbered
well-shaft near the garden. About 12ft.
deep, it never holds more than three feet
or so of water and is emptied by the time
I’ve lifted 35 gallons. It refills by seepage,
possibly from the water-table which
would not be deep here. The river is four
or five chains distant. The other day,
pouring water into the fowl-trough, I
noticed a small golden-brown fish about
the size of a large tadpole but with a head
not unlike a cod in miniature and
feathery fins. I have dredged up three
more of these fish. No stream feeds the
well. How do they get there?
STURT’S DESERT ROSE.
The desert rose holds sweetness to itself,
Tented in silk of amethyst; in secret places
blowing
Against the scarps of the incredible and silent
places,
Knowing the sound, the strength of mountain
currents flowing
Where eagles ride and nankeen kestrels play;
Knowing the praise of sun that warmly traces
The ancient pattern of each different day;
The poignant flattery that comes from things
That creep for honey, or whose shining wings
Brush at the heart; where comes in robbery
That bushman, thriving still, the stingless bee;
And from the saltbush the blue butterfly
That’s but a clipping of the northern sky
Hovers and passes. Where the finch cues for
summer, hot with song,
When cassia burns out cleft and pass with the
old fire of spring,
Filling the valley with sweet heaviness; where
long
Rivers of ants flow ceaselessly, and flocks
Of topaz and emerald parrots shout and swing;
Where bronze-wrought skinks run on the
lichened rocks:
The desert rose holds sweetness past all know-
ing,
Tented in silk of amethyst, in secret places
blowing.
And in the earth are all the petals shed,
The fruit will stand unheeded where the rose
has bled.

“Becks”: “Harbel” (B. 12/3/’52)
wants someone to tell him why the
thousands of flying-ants swarmed all over
the two bricklayers in preference to
settling on the scaffolding or other con-
venient parts of the landscape. Hasn’t

swarming insects always prefer to settle

“Bogaduck”; I’ll guarantee to shift for
all time any termite mound (B. 5/3/’52)
ever built by either of the following
methods; If there is no risk of starting
a bushfire, make a fair hole in the side
at ground-level running into the centre
of the mound. Then get on top of the
mound and use the crowbar to punch
another hole vertically down the centre.
Fill both holes with sticks and brush and
apply a match to the bottom lot. With the
central hole to act as a flue, the entire
inside of the mound burns away. In
dry season, when surrounding dead grass
causes fire risk, get on top with a
mattock and hack all the upper storey
away, leaving a large, saucer-shaped.
hollow. Fill that with about four gallons
of sump oil, which rapidly soaks down
through all the galleries. A week later
break down the mound with a pick and (
cart it away; you’ll find that the oil has
gone well down below ground-level, thus
rendering the basement of the nest un-
tenable.

“Gip”: The camp-oven (B. 27/2/’52)
is not extinct. I was surprised recently
when an otherwise modern young wife —
mother of two babies —inspected a farm-
house wood-stove doubtfully. “It would
take me a while to get used to cooking
on one of these,” she said. Thoughts of
electric stovettes and gasrings flashed
through my mind. “You see,” she
explained, “I’ve never cooked in anything
except a camp-oven.” Hub does the
rounds of stations in Western Queens-
land, dogging and boundary-riding, the

“K.”: Something went wrong with the
hot-water system in our house ; I failed
to fix it, and the missus got a plumber.
He not only upset all tradition by com-
ing promptly, but refused to charge for
clearing a valve. However, he left the
manhole in the ceiling open and a ladder
leading up to it. That night we killed a
black snake in the bedroom behind a
cabin-trunk. Since there was no other
visible means of entry we concluded he
had stalked the frog which had been
serenading the evening under a down-
pipe by the front veranda-step, chased
it up the downpipe, arrived on the roof,
got bushed there, crawled under the tiles,
entered the roof-space, and got into the
bedroom by climbing down the ladder
through the empty manhole. As belated
evidence in a recent Bully argument
about whether snakes hiss —this one
hissed like a leak in a steam-pipe before
being killed.

“E. and 0.E.”: The attempt to tame a
possum by feeding it with rose-petals (B.
27/2/’52) reminds me that I had a tame
possum whose favorite diet was green
dock leaves. Docks are not usually
encouraged in gardens, but they can
sometimes be found, and any gardener
willingly parts with them. That would
save the lady’s roses and please the
possum.

untidy scramble to get into the air, de-
parted hurriedly. I saw that ’gull many
times afterwards, and it was pathetic to
see how the loss of tail-feathers had

“Loulalo”: Though Buchan (Vic.)
sounds Scotch enough (B. 27/2/’52) the
locals claim that it is aboriginal—with
the local tribes the word bookin or buk-
kan stood for “dilly-bag.” The valley
has obviously always abounded in game:
no doubt it was a natural food-bag.
There are no survivors of the local tribes
now, nor is there any white man left who
can speak with certainty and authority.
Nobody, it seems, will ever know the true
origin of the name.
“Rann”: The peewee will make friends.
All you need is a little patience, a piece
of cheese and a gentle approach. A couple
began to visit the newly-dug ground of
my new home, and within a week of the
cheese treatment the hen bird took to
landing on the back porch and calling.
Now she comes inside if the lunch-service
is a bit slow. The cock will be in on the
cheese, but he keeps his distance. Sundry
relations have now appeared, and at the
present price of cheese entertaining has
become rather expensive.

“Burra”: Ever seen the oak planted in
Goulbum’s Belmore Park by Lady
Belmore in 1869 to commemmorate the
opening of the Sydney-Goulbum rail-
way? A trip round the extremities of its
lowest limbs takes you 255 ft., and the
branches have been pruned to prevent
sagging. This is sft. further than around
Melbourne’s giant oak, long reckoned to
have the biggest spread of any of its kind
in Australia. Goulburn’s elms, though
they haven’t the girth of the magnificent
specimens at Tumut’s racecourse, are
perhaps taller than them, need for space
having forced a pruning that has resulted
in a poplar-like growth. This has robbed
them of some natural splendor, but still
leaves them grand.

“Macdee”: My Sydney newspaper tells
me that the Pidgin-daranjara natives have

boots make the wearer mad for blood,
but protect him from harm. I always be-
lieved that in the old Arunta tribes the
kurdaitcha shoes were made of emu-
feather down and were worn by women,
their ritual use being prescribed for a
widow who suspected that her husband
had died of foul play. Or perhaps she
was egged on to assassinate a man or a
woman in a rival camp—the encourage-
ment being given by a headman, whose
business it was to create such incidents
now and then. Always the mission of the
kurdaitcha woman was to lay the evil
spirit which had taken the life of her
husband, which spirit was always to be
found in the body of somebody in an
enemy camp. With feet muffled in emu
shoes, and with appropriate weapons, the
widow departed to do in whoever had
done her wrong. If she didn’t come back,
who cared? The tribe had got rid of a
troublesome woman. If she did, she was
a heroine, and probably got another
husband.

“Shamuseen”: Kindly treatment of the
blacks in the early days didn’t always
pay. To Cullin-la-Ringo, now the scene
of the British Overseas Food Corpora-
tion’s grain sorghum project near Alpha
(C.Q.), in 1861 P. R. Willas took his flock
of 10,000 sheep and set up a cluster of
tents to house his own and the families
of the station-hands and shepherds. All
males were well armed, but Willas sternly
ordered that no provocation should be
offered to the natives. As a means of
establishing friendship he handed oyer to
the blacks for their own consumption a
small mob of sheep, and told them the
flock numbers would be maintained.
Friendly natives congregated in the home-
stead area, and gradually the watchfulness
of the opening days was relaxed and the
weapons of the whites no longer kept
always within easy reach. On October 17,
1861, the blacks made a perfectly-
synchronised attack on the entire white
party, whose members were widely
scattered. Nineteen of the 22 persons
on the property were butchered before
the murdering abos withdrew, leaving
behind them an easily-followed trail of
discarded plunder. Nine days later a
native police troop, reinforced with
squatters and shearers from neighboring
properties, took a Moody retribution.
* * * *
“Charbro”: All through our recent
shearing the heat was fierce and several
of the shearers were near collapsing. I
remarked to Townie, a half-blood
aboriginal yardman, that he, no doubt,
didn’t feel the heat as much as the
others. “No, boss,” he replied, “that’s
wrong. Lots o’ people say that to me;
but I tell you I feel it bad, it fair knocks
me up.” I said I understood that the
aboriginals in the days when the land
was theirs moved little in the very hot
weather and slept a good deal. “That’s
right,” rejoined Townie, “they stuck by
the creeks where it was cool and where
they could have a swim. Their tucker
came to them because the animals had to
come to the water. You see, boss, they
didn’t have any of this plurry nonsense
of workin’ for wages.”
* * * ♦
“Chuck”: “Yes, this property’s been
in our family a good while,” remarked
Barney. “Me grandfather selected it
first. His old man in England reckoned
! he was too lazy and shiftless for a steady
job, and they quarrelled, and me grand-
father come to Australia and took up
some bush country. He cleared it and
built fences, and put up a shack to live
in. Then he got married and me father
grew up, but he had a row with
Gran’dad because the old bloke reckoned
he wasn’t worth his salt at good honest
toil, so Dad worked out till the old bloke
died. After that he added another selec-
tion, rung it and made this a decent-
sized property.” Barney paused for a
mouthful of refreshment. “He’d have
done better with the selection on the
opposite side,” he remarked, putting down
the glass. “I told him that, but me and
the old man never did hit it about any-
thing. Thought I ought to graft like a
working bullock, and when I knocked up
he said I was a weakling and didn’t know
what work was. So I went wheatlumpin’
for years, and left him to it. Now,’’
Barney continued, “I’ve taken over.”
“Lucky you’ve got that boy of yours,”
volunteered Steve. “Him!” Barney’s
voice dripped disgust. “Gripes, they don’t
know what work is nowadays.”
“Jade”: Grandpa sighted an octopus
in his crab-pot and gaffed him to take
home. In the ensuing struggle it seemed
that the octopus was taking Grandpa
home. Grandpa carries a large sheath-
knife which is carefully tied into the
sheath lest it fall in the river ; he stood
on the gaff to get the knife and the
octopus pulled it from under his feet. At
the first stab the tentacles wrapped round
the knife and he had a job to get it back ;
took 10 stabs to kill the thing. Now
stories of undersea battles with giant
octopus no longer make Grandpa
derisive. The weight of the octopus
which gave 1031 b. Grandpa such a battle
was under 31b. After inspecting the
suckers, 160 on each of eight arms, still
retaining some suction after death, it
would seem that the more strain that is
on them the harder they hold, and that
possibly while the strain is on the octopus
could not let go if it wanted to. Would
seem that the only way to get loose
without a knife would be to pull it apart,
and an octopus is mighty tough.
STARLIGHT’S TRACK.
Red sets the sun on the sandstone bluffs
And gold on the flat below,
Where grass and bracken are brown and spent
Away from the river’s flow;
And the track comes down from the old south
road
Through a gap in the red rock walls,
Two thousand feet to the river flat
Where the Nattai bends and falls.
When the moon is white on the sandstone Muffs
And mist lies low on the land,
And the gaunt grey gums are tense and still
And dark by the river sand,
The Captain rides through the western gap,
So men of the district say,
And the Marston boys come close behind
With the gold of the Goulburn pay ;
And they pause for a while by the river flat
To plunder the Colony’s mail
And the loot from the coach on the old south
road
Where the rangers barred the trail;
And the troopers beat through the holly bush
Till the rock walls turn them back
For none but the Captain and his men
Knew the way of Starlight’s track.

TARGET UNIDENTIFIED
by MACNELL
C OURSE right. Gyro
checked. Lookouts
(apparently) looking-out.
Gun’s crew awake (the
young b s could hardly be
anything else, having just
closed-up). Radar aerial train-
ing. Asdic operating. The
Commissioned Gunner, officer
of the middle-watch, hauled the
Old Man’s high, wooden-legged
stool a bit nearer the compass
and wheelhouse voicepipe,
leaned back, drew deeply on the
cigarette cupped in his great
hand, and, suddenly remember-
ing, screwed his duffel-coated
bulk to look up at the masthead
steaming-light. Out. Of course
it was—wasn’t he at war again?
Funny, that, when you thought
of it. Up here, Asia a dim line
to port. Ship darkened, gun
closed-up, asdic pinging. Down
there, anywhere south of the
Indies, and you’re back to the
old peace-time routine. Upper-
deck blazing, muzzle-covers on,
depth-charges set to “safe” —
only the civvies worrying about
blackouts. Funniest bloody war
he’d ever been in—and he’d seen
two snorters, with a few of the
“civil” variety thrown in
between.
A sliding door rasped below,
Old Man. Instinctively the
Gunner pinched his fag half-
out before he remembered smok-
ing “in a sheltered place” was
permitted. Funny bird, the Old
Man. Keen as salt, conscientious
—why? Surely the old coot
knew he was passed-over for his
brasshat several unfortunate
lapses in the eye of the admiral
—last in the line, with a dozen
or so lieutenant-commanders
well ahead, and all younger, too.
Perhaps it was a sort of perverse
loyalty—“ I’ll show the b s
I can take it!”
But a likeable cow. He and
the Old Man understood each
other perfectly. Knew all the
wrinkles, both of ’em. That time
the stoker-petty-officers were
caught drinking in their mess
back in Moresby. The Old Man
had sent for him. “Nothing to
it, I know. But on a charge-
sheet alongside King’s Rules and
Admiralty Instructions, damned
bad. For me, too. Handle it,
will you?”
The Gunner had handled it—
and when he’d finished with the
Chief Stoker, president of the
mess, the forty-year-old Chief
had felt like an ordinary seaman,
He’d hate to feel how the
culprits in the mess had felt
after the Chief had taken it out
on them! Yes, he’d handled it.
No charges, no leave stopped,
no captain’s defaulters—and no
more sty-grogging in the stoker-
a j C t? rS mess.
And that young flippit in
Cairns who d fallen bilges-under
for that Errol Flynn of a
married radar-operator he’d
handled that, too, and though he
doubted if he’d cured the radar
bloke s high-frequency biological
impulses, he knew the girl’s
wised-up old-man had cured
her leanings.
Pity such a man-wise skipper
had been passed-over. Perhaps

i N “Night, Spike, Stuffy
as hell below. No, don’t move,
Just want a lungful of freshers
and I’ll be off.” (Cunning old
coot. After a look at the
compass, the asdic ring, the gun’s
crew the lookouts and my
entries in the log.) “Nice night.”
“Yes, sir.”
The Old Man, bald, shackle-
nosed and thin as a wire, leaned
his pyjama’d elbows on the fore
windbreak, and stared ahead to
where the faint white legs of
the guard-rail stanchions walked
together and met at the bull-
ring in the eyes of the ship.
Good man, the Gunner,
Good man to have on his bridge,
Come in through a side-door, as
it were, up the hawse-pipe, but
he was as reliable as double-
checked synchronised aircraft
ammunition. He could think of
a few front-door entries he
wouldn’t trust with a skiff,
Funny how he naturally called
him Spike. Natural for a
Riordan to become that, as
natural as Dusty Rhodes,
Smouge Smith, Dingy Bell. But
not so natural for his captain
to “Spike” him. And the rest
of the wardroom accepted the
familiarity unthinkingly. Pos-
sibly because no one could
imagine the old Gunner impos-
ing in the least on the intimacy.
Possibly because he’s older than
me—and in a frigate. Then, of
course, we’re both gunnery.
“By the way. Spike I hope
to get off a few rounds to-
morrow.”

The bellow burst across the
bridge, delivered in a voice that
had trained a thousand gun-
crews. The port lookout jerked
his head up from the comfort-
a ble cup of his left hand and
strove to push his burning ears
into the twin eyepieces of his
binoculars.
“What time d’ you expect to
open fire, sir?”
“Dawn.”
“Just give me time to line-up
receivers and we’ll let the
Manbyrnong-mashers loose.”
The captain yawned, and
almost accidentally let his eyes
rest on the lighted face of the
asdic bearing-repeat. In the
space of the yawn he heard
several “pings” as the little
hammer in the ship’s bowels
shafted out its cheese-shaped
slice of sound, heard no echoing
“peeps.” He scratched the
thinly-thatched anchor of his
ear.
“I’m off, Guns. Usual shake,
Good shooting.”
“Goodnight, sir.”
Actuated by years of rigid
training, the Gunner at once
called the bosun’s mate,
“Sir?”
“Shake the captain at three-
fifty.”
“Three-fifty. Aye aye sir.”

Now and then a flash of white
gleamed below her guard-rails,
where the oily curve of the bow-
wave briefly broke and splashed,
to whip away astern and sub-
side colorlessly into the dark
that pressed wide and dense on
all sides.
Even as he listened, his heart
quickening, to the urgent, but
still cautious, voice of the asdic-
operator reaching him through
the open voicepipe, the Gunner
wondered why he hadn’t heard
the set’s betraying screech.
There his wondering stopped. It
was replaced by a cold, instant
certainty of action.
“Range?”
“O-one-five, sir. Moving
fast. I think—torpedo.”
Fifteen hundred yards.
Torpedo—anything up to forty
knots.
As he spoke into the wheel-
house voicepipe the Gunner
realised his voice would carry

“You asked for Benson and Hedges cigarettes, Sir”

command tributes only of the best; it is for these that
BENSON mdHEDGES have thoughtfully provided
their Super Virginia cigarettes.

would hear the engine-room
telegraphs, anyway.
“Full ahead together! Hard-
a-port! Get it on!”
Even before she felt the thrust
of the hard-over rudder-face
the Old Man was running up the
bridge-ladder. Guns moved
easily away from the gyro-
compass.
“Torpedo. Port beam.”
He stepped to the windbreak
and called to the squat shadow
below which was “A” twin four-
inch.
“ ‘A’ gun. Close up. With
D.A. load. Target submarine.
Port side. Remain fore and aft.
Keep your eyes skinned.”
Now she was heeling. Shud-
dering. Two thousand tons
heaved abruptly from her steady
course, dragged by a few square
feet of rigid rudder-face and
thrust by seven thousand horse-
power culminating in the water-
savaging curves of two giant
clover-leaves of bronze.
Side by side on the wooden
grating round the binnacle
captain and gunner waited,
braced against the heel, silent.
The captain knew her previous
course, knew from where the
torpedo had sprung, and so
knew when to straighten her. If
she wasn’t, any second,
straightened up abruptly by a
giant’s hammer-blow against her
thin plates.
Ten degrees to go to make the
ninety-degree turn and the
captain spoke.
“Midships.”
The rudder swung fore and
aft, neutral.
“Starb’d twenty.”
Over the opposite way, the
helmsman’s grunts coming up
the voicepipe as he twirled it on.
“Ease to ten.”
She was easy now, the mad
swinging over, though she was
still shuddering with speed.
“Steer two-seven-o.”
The Gunner, glasses up, spoke
quietly.
“Missed.”
“Yes, but the b ’s got
seven more in his bows. Bosun’s
mate —go below and shake all
hands to action-stations. Cox’n
first —tell him to shake all hands
—then first-lieutenant. Quiet as
you can.”
The youngster slid down the
bridge-ladder.
Perhaps the two officers were
thinking, with a fraction of their
rapidly-calculating minds, that
this, their own particular and
intimate little experience, could
be perhaps the spark to
fuse the powder - keg of
world-preparedness into an
unholy conflagration the
long - awaited, long - prepared-
for, long-dreaded holocaust of
World War Finis. But they
showed no signs of it. Each
was calculating. Calculation was
their essence of life. The one —
course, speed, enemy speed,
depth, bearing seamanship.
The other —point of aim, fire-
control, procedure orders, quiet
exultation —gunnery.
WITH the asdic-set echoing
its resonant “peep” of
detection —not the harsh screech
of the speeding torpedo’s move-
ment —the frigate, now closed-
up, went into action smoothly,
almost automatically. The anti-
submarine procedure in being
long before the Battle of the
Atlantic, developed through it,
improved on again, began with
those first, steady “peeps,” ran
through the bridge-team and
asdic-office in a series of
staccato, perfectly - understood
orders, and ended, temporarily,
at the depth-charge crews, dim
shadows on the quarter-deck,
round the rails and throwers.
The ship thrust on, its fighting
mechanism ticking like a well-
oiled clock, like the quiet,
dreadful running of the plotting-
mechanism in the asdic-office.
Then, at exactly the right
moment, a couple of operators
watching tensely its moving
paper and graph-tracing pointers,
the firing-clock actuated depth-
charge rails and throwers. The
ship exploded into action.
Down dropped the charges,
down, while a trickle of water
forced through tiny holes and
built up pressure on a sharp,
thin spike of steel. The steel
struck. The detonator blew into
the primer, the primer in a
fraction of time changed 3001 b.
of passive high-explosive into a
pressure-pounding eruption. All
round the submarine. She dived,
twisted, ran towards, fled away
—followed, with omniscient
exactitude, by the tiny shaft of
sound tapped from her pursuer’s
hull, which returned in an
exultant, magnified echo, echo,
then forerunner, then echo
again to the blasting, hull-
crushing explosions the frigate
spawned methodically from her
wake-washed tail.
The captain, centre-figure of
a quiet and busy group, listened
to his asdic-officer’s report,
sniffed and spoke.
“All right, sub.—that’ll do her.
Smell it, Guns? Down-wind.”
They all smelt it now—the
pungent, unmistakable odor of
heavy fuel-oil, snaking surface-
wards and lying, in a sea-
smoothing reach, down-current
ahead. Submarine fuel.
A minute before, captain,
gunner, first-lieutenant, asdic-
officer had been workmen—
thinking only of doing a job, the
job, for which their years of
training had prepared them,
Detect, attack, destroy that
which had attacked them.
Now, cruising slowly up-
current, the smell of oil heavy
in their nostrils, filling the quiet
night, there was time to apply
thought - processes to other
things. The captain left his
binnacle and leaned his hands
on the fore windbreak, gazing
ahead into darkness. Below
him, patches of lightness, the
upturned faces of “B” gun
watched him,
God, thought the Gunner,
again at the binnacle, officer-of-
the-watch—suppose the Old
Man’s made a mistake? Com-
pared to his other lapse—this!
You didn’t stop to think when a
forty-knot tinfish leapt at you;
you were captain, your slightest
wish was an inflexible command,
you had a ship specifically
designed and built to smash the
thing that had spat the contents
of one of its eye-sockets at you ;
so you didn’t stop to think, just
automatically acted. But back
in Navy Office they had all week
to think, and weigh, and judge—
a passed - over lieutenant-
commander. Thank the Lord
I’m only a gunner!
T" HE captain lifted his weight
' from his hands and stood
there a moment. Then he
turned and came back to the
gunner and first-lieutenant. You
could cut their sympathetic
embarrassment with a hull-
scraper.
He wished the old gunner was
alone. Number One was one of
his own, college-bred, all his
career before him, too young to
know the constant, soul-searing
knowledge that all your team-
mates knew you were passed
over. The gunner his sympathy
was understanding -man for
man. The first - lieutenant s
sympathy, junior officer for his
captain, was indecent, not
according to K.R. and A.I.
K.R. and A.I. There were
things laid down which had to
be done on occasions like this,
It was significant that the captain
spoke to his gunner.
“We’ve got her all right. Guns,
Too much of that stinking stuff
for her to release deliberately.”
“She’s there for good all right,
sir.”
The other two officers waited,
God, why don’t they say it? The
power, the privilege of
command. It’s all mine with
the responsibility! You re the
boy. You sank an unidentified
submarine. “Target unidenti-
tied.” That’s what the signal to
Navy Office, and the world, will
say. Unidentified.
The captain, unconsciously,
was again facing the pungent
dark ahead. For one brief
moment he toyed with the
ridiculous idea of keeping it
quiet. Quiet? With a ship s
company exulting over their first
kill? His kill,
The captain turned, and, try-
ing to conceal his struggle,
showed it by the struggle to
conceal it on his face. He threw
up his head, looking round the
bridge, an expression on ms
wind - weathered face,
shadowed in the binnacle-hgh ,
which made the watching gunner
feel hed follow him through
hell and beyond,
“Signalman, the captain
called.

UNCABLED

BOOST FOR J. BULL.
As noted here, there’s been a
whale of a lot of crocodile tears
in the U.S. and other countries
about poor old failing J. Bull,
with a startling amount of plain
bellyaching in the old chap’s
own country itself on the same
score.
So at least it’s a bit of a
change to find an appreciation
suggesting that perhaps he isn’t
so decrepit after all. As in the
following “New York Times”
editorial evaluation:
“Geographically, Britain is the
sentinel, the advance-post, of the
European Continent. As a naval
and air base she was vital in
the Second World War and
would appear more so in an
atomic war.
“She has national service of
two years for British youth, and
Britons are good soldiers. Four
divisions of land troops are now
in Germany, and if Russia were
to move westward tomorrow the
British would be fighting for
Europe with more strength than
any Continental country.
“The British Empire, for all its
reduced power, has a valuable
string of naval bases around the
world—Gibraltar, Malta, Suez,
Aden, Singapore, Hong Kong, to
mention the most important.
The British Navy itself,
although it no longer rules the
waves, is the second-largest in
the world and second to none
in skill, experience and spirit.
“The Royal Air Force also
must be rated high and is
pioneering in the field of jet
planes.
“Finally, one liias to take into
account Britain’s central position
in a world-wide Commonwealth.
With Britain as an ally one
[meaning Uncle Sam] can count
at least on Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, Ceylon and the
many colonial possessions, and
probably on India, Pakistan and
South Africa.”
Also on J. Bull’s credit side,
an official memorandum on the
British Army Estimates refers to
the Centurion tank as generally
recognised as one of the best, if
not the best, of its size in any
modern army. Its production is
increasing. The memorandum
further states that during 1952-53
new weapons and equipment will
begin to reach the troops in sub-
stantial quantities—which means
a lot more than it may seem to
say.
As another indication,
Britain’s share of the 4000 air-
craft agreed as the N.A.T.O.
target for the coming year will
be at least one-third, if Fighter
Command is included. In fact,
Britain (London “Times” report)
now has probably the largest
single national armed force in
Western Europe.
That last remarkable fact has
been more arrestingly stated by
“M anchester Guardian’s,”
military correspondent:
“Tell most Englishmen that
their country has become the
greatest land Power in Europe
and they will think the frost has
touched you. Britain as a sea
Power, yes ; as a land Power, no.
It is against the order of nature.
Yet today it is true. It is, of
course, a measure of decline in
France and destruction in Ger-
many, and with the military re-
vival of both countries through a
common army the position
should come nearer to normal.
But today, whether she likes it
or not, Britain is the foremost
land Power in Western Europe.
“Consider, first, her Army in
the field. It includes the only
mobile striking force available
to General Eisenhower —the
three armoured divisions, 6th
(the Mailed Fist), 7th (the Desert
Rats), and 11th (the Triumphant
Bull). It is up to strength,
although short of subalterns. It
is commanded and staffed by
officers with wide war-time ex-
perience. And it is moderately
well trained, in spite of frequent
changes of men. As much could
not be said of any Continental
country’s army.
“Or consider, secondly, the
Army’s equipment. The three
armoured divisions are almost
fully supplied with Centurion
tanks. The French and Italians
are still working with war-time
Shermans which, sturdy as they
are, were born beside the
Centurion’s old grandfather, the
Cromwell, Even the United
States troops in Europe have
lagged far behind the British
in tanks. Britian alone of the
European nations has been able
to equip her forces from her own
industry, and equip them well.
Sad to say, only one French
division has French equipment.
The rest depend on the American
arsenal.
“Or consider, as a third point,
Britain’s supply of trained
soldiers. She has her four
divisions on the Continent, 10
divisions in reserve in the
Territorial Army at home, and
further resources in Class Z and
elsewhere... .Since the war
Britain alone has called her
young citizens to the colors for
two years’ service, except for a
brief break when it dropped to
18 months, and Britain alone has
given them annual training after
they leave the active army.”
How They Quit
"Paradise."
They’re still getting through
the Iron Curtain as fast as they
can make it —some of them, it
seems, with the aid of a shove
from the rear.
To Western Germany (“New
York Times” correspondent’s re-
port) “refugees continue to come
in at the rate of five thousand
monthly, plus other thousands
who hide with relatives and are
not included in the official
count.”
They are, the correspondent
adds, of all ages and all con-
ditions, and have all sorts
of reasons for making the
break. All are shabby, ill-
shod and somehow devitalised.
Those who arrive in West
Berlin, the easiest “out,” are
workers more often than intel-
lectuals or “bourgeois elements.”
All are seeking the status of
political refugees:
“Undoubtedly some refugees
are Communist agents. Others
are criminals fleeing from justice.
The investigators suspect that the
Soviet stooges in East Germany
are easing the way to the West,
not only for spies and agitators,
but also for riffraff swept out to
make trouble for the Western
authorities.”
The genuine escaping is going
steadily on all along where the
Iron Curtain hangs, with the
escapers from “paradise” resort-
ing to some ingenious, dangerous
and even funny ways of getting
out.
“More than once,” an Edin-
burgh “Scotsman” correspondent
has reported from Vienna, “the
—London "Daily Mail.”
THE TRADE HANDICAP.
Communist pilot of a plane fly-
ing officially from one
Rumanian town to another has
been forced at the point of a gun
to continue on to Turkey—with
a complement of conspiratorial
passengers who had all booked
seats for freedom.
“Soldiers, police and frontier
guards, ostensibly Communist,
have from time to time marched
into Austria, uniformed and
fully armed, and given them-
selves up. Innumerable ski-
parties have crossed the Austrian
frontier in the mountains.
“Railwaymen at Vienna
stations, hearing cries, have
crawled beneath engines to
rescue half-frozen human beings
who have travelled in this way
from Prague or Budapest. Other
fugitives have crawled out, badly
injured, from beneath truckloads
of coal.”
The brightest escape listed is
that credited to 12 young
Hungarians:
“These men, dressed in shorts
and singlets, with numbers
pinned to their backs, bicycled
through the Hungarian frontier
control, shouting to the Com-
munist guards: ‘Clear the track!
Budapest-Vienna international
cycle-race! ’ The unsuspecting
guards cheered the leaders, and
laughed amiably at the laggard
who brought up the rear. But all
the cyclists finished level—out-
side a police-station in the
American sector of Vienna, and
asked for asylum as political
fugitives.”
For Prosperity.
London “Sunday Times”
prescribes for Britain (and
maybe elsewhere);
“What every man and woman
needs to be told, with all the
vehemence and humanity that
Mr. Churchill put into his war-
time speeches, is how he or she
can make his or her own con-
tribution towards regaining
prosperity and raising our
standards to still higher levels:
“Produce more.
“Work a bit faster or a bit
longer.
“Make that extra effort which
may not seem worthwhile: it is,
“Help to cut out all waste of
labor, materials, or time.
“Do not spend money on un-
necessary things.
“Save all you can ; for if there
had been enough saving we
should not have been in this
difficulty, and only by saving
more can we get out of it.
“If you do these things for
yourselves, the State will not
need to try to do them for you
by stiff controls and high
taxation.”
Dragnet Digest.
No End to Korea. —Debunk-
ing the idea that, with a good
settlement, Uncle Sam can wipe
his hands of Korea, “New York
Times” points out: “Truce or
no truce, Korea is going to be
a problem in American foreign
policy for many years to come ;
it is as much a part of our global
frontiers as the North-West
Frontier of India was to the
British.”
Moscow Conference. —“One
of the most persuasive publicity
campaigns yet attempted by the
Kremlin’s propagandists is being
devoted to the International
Economic Conference,” due to
be held in Moscow next month.
Thus reporting, an Edinburgh
“Scotsman” correspondent
further states that the conference
“is being publicised on a scale
which shows that Moscow
regards it as one of the most
important events since the
war.”
Our Old Friend Johnno. —
Gallip. Diggers won’t be sur-
prised by this finding by London
“Daily Telegraph” military cor-
respondent Lieut.-General H. G.
Martin on Johnno today: “In
his shapeless battle-dress the
Turkish soldier may not be a
thing of beauty. What matters
is that he is still the same tough
Anatolian peasant whom so
many of us have reason to
remember nearly 40 years ago.
As a friend who knows current
form remarked to me: Tf the
Russians attack they’ll have to
dig him out —and he’s just not
diggable.’ ”
Formosa Change. Unless
Communist China’s attitude in
Korea and elsewhere alters sur-
prisingly, U.S. policy is con-
sidered certain to change
drastically. One probability
noted by a Washington cor-
respondent of London “Sunday
Times” is that the U.S. Seventh
Fleet, while continuing to pro-
tect Formosa, might no longer
be under orders to prevent offen-
sive action from Formosa
against the mainland, in which
case Peking, which under
present arrangement can ignore
any threat from Formosa, would
be forced to shift some forces
from the north and south
towards the centre.
Where Uncle Sam Fails. —
Americans, comments a New
York “Herald Tribune” cor-
respondent, can be proud, on
the whole, of the part the United
States has been playing in
Europe: “But we cannot be
proud of the part the United
States has been playing in the
Middle East, if only because the
United States has been playing
very little part at all.”
Nagging at J. Bull. —London
“Time and Tide,” irked by the
U.S. negative policy in the
Middle East and American carpl-
- at the one who still has the
main responsibility for uphold-
ing such “battered fragments of
security” as remain there: “If
Britain is to be expected to con-
tinue to shoulder the whole
burden, it is fair to urge that her
allies should allow her the moral
authority, as well as the material
means, to do so, should no
longer nag about imperialism,
and should admit frankly that
the duty which belongs to all is
being discharged by one.”
Bringing in Spain. —Though
Washington has yet to give the
final word, “New York Times”
reports negotiations in Madrid
as having reached the point
where it is a foregone conclusion
that an agreement with Spain
will shortly be signed under
which Franco will make contri-
butions to Western defence in
return for U.S. aid.

SUNDRY SHOWS
GIESEKING.
At his first Sydney recital
Gieseking, dwarfing his big
piano to the size of a baby-
grand, bent low over it —not to
hear what Mozart was saying, as
one thought at first, but to tell
him to be a good boy and
remembter his lessons; where-
upon young Wolfgang Amadeus
developed a rallentando in the
theme of the variations to the
A Major Sonata (KV33I), and
haying thus compromised his
unique ability to build-up
musical feeling with metronomic
precision, the little voice which
used to be such a model of
sincerity, became a trifle self-
conscious, invited admiration of
its period-costume, and turned
the loveliness of the trio of the
minuet into prettiness.
After this still superb perform-
ance; —there was some scale-
playing in the Alla Turca rondo
that brought many forward in
their seats —one wondered how
Gieseking would get on with
Beethoven; but at the second,
Saturday, concert, Beethoven
was standing no nonsense, and
took over himself a noble read-
ing of the A Flat Sonata, Op.
110; the first part of his last
pianistic will and testament; and
as Gieseking strained, squirmed
and sweated at the piano, red to
the bald circle on top of his head
with his exertions, the ageing
master spoke of the frustrations
of life and of resignation to
death and of the consolation of
music: perhaps in no form of
art so much as in music is the
swan-song more unmistakeable;
the enhanced beauty of the world
to the eye preparing to close
upon it evolves the “grandeur”
and “vision of the infinite” which
annotators see in Beethoven’s
last phase.
That hands so capable of the
characteristic ring of Beethoven’s
tone, and the blooming and
glowing echoes of Schumann,
and the liquid elegance of
Chopin, should be able in a
moment to become Dunlopillo
pads for three “Images” by
Debussy, surprises everyone;
but the greatest surprise to most
Australian listeners is that
Debussy can be played like that
at all: sounds flooded and mixed
by hands and feet and then held
in suspense as though behind
translucent enamel—not only
this, but in the second concert,
Gieseking brought forward
another Debussy still, more
energetic, with an entirely dif-
ferent technique, in the “Suite
Bergamaske” ; and then a comic
Debussy, played as encore, in
“Golliwog’s Cakewalk.”
It is not enough for the great
pianist of today to be a pas-
sionate exponent; he must be a
critic and musicologist, too;
master of many styles, and a
clear expositor of different
styles of the same composer: of
such Gieseking must be counted
one of the greatest, and certainly
as the most marvellous Debussy
player ever to visit Australia.
Blake Prize.
The general impression given
by the 55 exhibited entries for
the Blake Prize for religious
painting (at Mark Foy’s Gallery,
Sydney) is, with very few excep-
tions, of a particularly distin-
guished collection of assorted
artistic idiocies.
The winner, for 200 guineas, is
Frank Hinder’s “Flight Into
Egypt,” which consists of series
of planes in neon colors and of
varied shapes, so arranged to
form a kind of puzzle in which,
when it is examined from the
right distance and for long
enough, may be discerned the
angular figures of a man,
woman, child and ass. Apart
from its momentary interest as
a 30-second puzzle, it might be
said on behalf of the picture that
its clear simple colors give it a
certain distinction from the
masses of tortured paint around
it, and that the figures in it, once
found, have a certain biblical
dignity. Altogether it would
probably serve as an excellent
design for a stained-glass-
window (which is its immediate
effect on the viewer) for a church
designed according to the
modem style of architecture
which seems to live by a set-
square and ruler and avoids any
sort of curves like the plague.
To the second-prizewinner,
Michael Kmit’s “The Ascen-
sion,” may be conceded the most
remarkable good luck in collect-
ing 50 guineas for an undistin-
guished spread of chalky paint,
and to the third, Sydney Nolan’s
“Flight Into Egypt,” a peculiar
painting of light which, unearthly
though it is, at least gives the
painting a kind of radiance,
appearing to come from behind
and illuminating the chocolate-
brown earth, the cactus, the
gum-tree, the ass and the dis-
torted figures including an
inverted angel in a pink dress—
of which the picture consists.
Assuming—with some diffi-
culty—that the judges selected
the best of the entries for exhibi-
tion it does not appear that they
could have done much better
with the prizemoney—except
retain it. Nor does it appear
that the competition is making
any headway towards its defined
object of encouraging religious
painting. The prime object of
religious painting as such should
be to move the beholder to some
degree of reverence, and one can
derive more of that spirit from a
square inch of Gruner than from
the whole exhibition of gaudy
distortion and artistic clowning
at Mark Foy’s.
O.F.
Borovanskys.
After their “Sleeping Princess”
at Sydney Empire the Boro-
vanskys have gone back to a
programme “Swan Lake,”
“Petrouchka” and “Beau
Danube” infinitely better
suited to showing up the com-
pany’s talents.
Edna Busse danced “Swan
Lake” on the opening night, and
gave it a fragile, bird-like and
slightly-wistful accent, which
was quite beautiful, if quite dif-
ferent from the Peggy Sager
version, with its remote beauty
and coldly intense tragedy, like
the breaking of a heart of ice.
Peggy Sager, Miro Zloch and
Charles Boyd play out the tragi-
comedy of “Petrouchka” with
admirable comic grace and pre-
cision in the midst of all its
colorful exuberance; in a charm-
ing “Beau Danube,” Dorothy
Stevenson, Edna Busse, Kathleen
Gorham, Paul Grinwis and
Borovansky himself give a dozen
or so good explanations of the
company’s success; and in both
“Petrouchka” and as King of
the Dandies in “Beau Danube,”
Bruce Morrow looked like a
good promise for the future.
"The Madwoman of
Chaillot."
Jean Giraudoux, the French
novelist and playwright who
served in World War I and be-
came a member of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs at its con-
elusion, and after the Nazi
conquest was made director of
propaganda at Vichy under
Marshal Petain, here writes a
thunderous and wildly-humorous
satire against those despoilers of
the spirit, the money-grubbers.
Its 30-odd characters were very
well done, in fact, extraordi-
narily well done by the Mel-
bourne Little Theatre on its tiny
stage at South Yarra.
The Madwoman is an appar-
ently cracked old lady dressed
in odds and ends of fashions
who owns a Paris cafe
frequented by the underworld of
criine, art and commerce. In
her crackpottery there is a sort
of wisdom just as there is crack-
pottery in the wisdom of the
financial gentry. The financial
gentry have discovered that there
is a vast lake of oil underneath
the city and are prepared to
sacrifice Notre Dame, the
Pantheon, the Louvre and every-
thing else that Paris stands for
for the oil.
The old lady convinces them
that the oil is in the Paris sewers,
gets them down into her cellar
and introduces them to a door
opening on a shaft that presum-
ably leads down to the hell that
is paved with good intentions;
and they all march down and
she slams the door. Paris is
saved again as it was in World
War II when the French Gov-
ernment, instead of fortifying it,
declared it an open city. Pos-
sibly Giraudoux had a part in
that achievement and it might
have been the inspiration for his
fantastic drama.
The ragpickers, deaf-mutes,
street-singers, presidents, pros-
pectors, jugglers, sewermen and
whatnot on whom the dramatist
plays his fancy were all well
done by the Little Theatre
players, but none did so well as
Loveday Hills as the Mad-
woman of Chaillot.

Using shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves) as a measuring-rod, this co. is
now the largest of the private trading-
banks in Australasia, ranking ahead of
the ’Wales, which is the oldest of them.
But the ’Wales leads the field in the
volume of advances and deposits handled.
Registered in London on March 28,
1951, the A. and N.Z. Bank amalgamated
the interests of the ’Asia and the Union
on a pound-for-pound basis. They were
two Anglo-Australian institutions, which
originally set up in the 1830’s and
weathered all subsequent economic
and financial storms without ever
failing to pay a dividend. The
aims behind the merger were; (1)
creation of a “markedly strong bank well-
equipped to meet all competition,” (2)
further development of services to cus-
tomers, (3) an expanded field of opera-
tions, and (4) less expensive building
programme.
First accounts —they are presented in
Australian currency and cover approxi-
mately 11 months to Sept. 30, 1951 —
show expansion in both earning-power
and volume of business. The “Wild
Cat” has amalgamated the 1950 figures
of the two old cos., which were in sterl-
ing, and converted them into Australian
currency at the current rate of exchange.
Although not strictly comparable with
1951 results, because of uneven time
periods, the comparison does indicate
trends on a conservative basis.
After allowing unstated amounts for
taxation and other contingencies, includ-
ing the fall in market-value of Govern-
ment securities, net earnings for the period
to Sept. 30 last were £721,429, or £21,011
more than the combined figures for
1950. The £721,429 was 6.7 p.c. on capi-
tal as against 6.5 p.c. for the previous
year, or a mere 3.8 p.c. on shareholders’
funds. The div. was kept at a nominal
10 p.c., which U.K. income tax of 9s. 6d.
in the £ reduced to 5| p.c. (stg.), worth
6.59 p.c. in Australian currency at the
present rate of exchange.
From a banking point of view the
co.’s position is an exceptionally strong
one:

The growth of £6,649,966 in deposits, due
partly to inflated wool and metal prices,
was accompanied by an expansion of
£7,984,153 in advances (despite credit re-
strictions) and of £5,980,957 in low-
interest-bearing liquids. The latter in-
cludes £100,083,000 frozen on “special
account” with the Commonwealth Bank
at y p.c. interest, while deposits include
£17,250,000 borrowed from the same in-
stitution at 3y p.c. So interest paid to
the Commonwealth Bank on the amount
borrowed from it was £103,345 more than
the sum received in interest on the large
amount which the co. is compelled to
deposit with that institution. This public-
spirited attitude —the co. thus deliber-
ately curbed its own net earnings in order
to assist its clients—is characteristic of
the private trading banks generally; a
fact not always fully appreciated by the
public.
Since the close of accounts the spot-
light has kept on shifting from one
feature to another in the economic and
financial scene. There has been a size-
able drop in export income, due mainly
to the fall in wool prices. The Govern-
ment, in its fight against inflation, tight-
ened credit, restricted new capital-issues
and increased taxation, all on a selective
basis designed to encourage essential and
damp-down less essential production
and trade activities. It has also
budgeted for a surplus of £114.5
million, and raised the rate of interest on
Government bonds by | p.c., making it
3| p.c.
Meanwhile, a flood of imports, hastened
by developments overseas, has brought a
balance-of-payments crisis; that is to say,
we have been buying more from abroad
than we could pay for out of current
export income. Here the Government
has been slow to act; but, seized of the
gravity of the position, it has taken appro-
priate action to correct it, namely, quick
reduction of imports by licensing con-
trol. To reduce its own financial obesity
it proposes to cut defence and public
works expenditure and call a halt to
expansion of social-service benefits. And
it might yet have to taper its immigration
programme. Unless budgetary and other
cuts are severe enough, the remaining
overload of demand might require
tougher measures than yet contemplated.
Beyond these short-tem: remedies lies
the need for a positive longterm pro-
gramme to stimulate export earoings and
strengthen our internal competitive
power. It is on the details and possible
consequences of measures taken to
achieve these ends that opinions diverge.
So far as the banks are concerned, it
all means reduced earnings in the ex-
change market, which might be more than
offset by a growth in advances, which in
turn depends upon central bank direc-
tives relating to credit-control, etc.

Composition of this group at June 30
last was Humes, Ltd. (parent co.)
and two main subsidiaries, Hume Steel,
Ltd., and Hume Industries (Far East),
Ltd. Since the close of accounts the New
Zealand interests of the parent and steel
cos. have been passed to Hume Indus-
tries (N.Z.), Ltd., for £400,000 in scrips—
£2s6,Blo to the parent and £143,190 to
the steel co. These shares were then
handed to another newly-formed off-
shoot, Humes Holding (N.Z.), Ltd.,
wholly-owned by Humes, Ltd., in
exchange for a like amount of its own
scrip. The whole group operates a string
of 53 factories —36 Australia, 14 New
Zealand and three Malaya—whose prin-
cipal products are concrete and concrete-
lined-steel pipes, demand for which has
strengthened in an expanding post-war
economy.
In Nov., 1950, the parent handed
those on its ord. register £405,920
of bonus scrip, one for two, out
of a reserve of £477,190 created by
writing up (conservatively the chairman
says) the book-value of the scrip in its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Hume Steel,
Ltd. The gift followed a cash issue at
par of 270,750 £1 ords. toward the close
of accounts in 1950.
Aggregate net earnings for the year to
June 30 last were £95,055 stronger at
£338,382. That was after allowing
£207,039 (up £81,361) for depreciation and
£304,595 (up £161,827) for taxation. The
pref. div. called for £27,188, and the
£311,194 that remained was 25,5 p.c. on
ord. capital as against 40, 25.5, 38.8 and
13.4 p.c. back to 1947. That leaves out
of the reckoning a windfall of £65,054
on account of exchange, £195,470 written
off war damage claims by the Far East
co., and a book shrinkage of £201,835
net in reserves. The div. was kept at
10 p.c., making average distribution
8 p.c. over the last five years.
For the first half of the current
term the parent and two main
subsidiaries report increased turnover
and satisfactory profits, and an
interim 5 p.c. is to be handed to the
ords. on March 31. Enough orders are
on hand to keep plant busy for the rest
of the term, and the final result is
expected to be better than the 1951 figure.
Since steel-plate is on the “administra-
tive” list in the new import-licensing
schedule, output of the steel co. may not
be immediately affected—imported steel
enabled this co., best profit-earner of the
group last term, to nearly double its net
earnings.
There was a drop of £175,825 in the
more-or-less liquid surplus (£597,975),
due to a net expenditure of £294,712 on
fixed assets and the writing-down of war-
damage claims:

Stocks increased by £387,126 and book

added to the overdraft and £282,316 to
the amount coming to sundry creditors,
etc. The written down book-value of
war claims is expected to be received in
full. The asbestos deposit, commercial
value of which has yet to be established,
is in N.Z W and presumably has been
handed over to the new subsidiary.
Since the books were ruled off 456,830
new £1 ords. have been issued at par,
raising paid capital to £2,037,500 in
112,500 A and 250,000 B prefs., both
p.c. cumulative, and 1,675,000 ords.
On that lot pref. divs. and 10 p.c, to the
ords. will call for £143,694 less profit than
was claimed last term.
At 355. 6d, (40s, a year ago) the ords.
return 5.6 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.

Specialising in sporting-goods, the co.
also does a large business in tobacco,
radios and electrical appliances, haircuts,
tailoring, fishing-gear and a variety of
oddments from a chain of city shops, and
has strong connections among suburban
retailers and sporting bodies.
Last accounts cover the 15 months to
July 31, 1951. On an annual basis the
profit was £34,836 (up £8432), and the
distribution \A\ p.c. (up 3j p.c.), best
showing since the co. was formed over
40 years ago. Sporting-goods and elec-
trical appliances, which came forward in
better volume, made a “substantial con-
tribution” to profits, the board says. The
£34,836 was 19.8 p.c. on average capital
as against 15.9, 15.1, 15.5, 14.4 and 12.8
p.c. back to 1946. The lift in the div.,
etc. —the etcetera was a 3 p.c, bonus —
made the average distribution over the

5.6 p.c. for the preceding six years and
4.1 p.c. for the decade before that.

The growth of £29,815 in freeholds and of

stated figure of a 54ft-frontage property
adjoining the co.’s Haymarket premises,
payment being made partly in cash and
partly in f,-p. £1 shares, which were issued
at a premium of 15s, each. Stocks
increased by £77,757 and book debts by
£44,745, while only £50,178 was added to
the trade debt, etc. The slip in the more-
or-less liquid surplus (£59,571) was
£2376.
The current term is not likely to be
as good as the one on whose heels it
treads. Spending has become less free
following the rise in cost of food, cloth-
ing, transport and other essentials and
heavier taxation. And now severe cuts
in imports will reduce supplies of manu-
factured tobacco and cigarettes from
abroad, as well as some other lines the
co, handles. Local production is expected
to approximate demand for most sporting-
goods, radios and ammunition. The
tussle will be one between turnover and
costs —the latter are still rising and
threaten to be the more stubborn of the
two.
The f.-p. £1 ords., which fell from a
peak of 445. 6d. in 1951 to 365. 9d. in
February last, dropped to 325. following
announcement of the Government’s
import-licencing plan. The return at 325.
would be 9 p.c. on a 14.5 p.c. div. basis,
or 6 p.c. on a 10 p.c. distribution. Net
tangible cover is 335. lid. per pound of
paid capital.

This old-established tanner and manu-
facturer of leather beltings and
industrial leathers continues to step
along in fine style. Shareholders
have had divs. averaging 15 p.c.
over the last half-dozen years, sweetened
with £25,000 of bonus-scrip, one for four,
in 1949. Also £50,000 of 5 p.c, pref.
capital was gathered in 1950. At end
February last 50,000 new £l6 p.c. second
prefs. were offered at par to those on the
pref. register. The money is wanted to
reduce the debt and help finance further
expansion of the business. And, on the
basis of last term’s figures, it will earn a
lot more than its keep, which means that
it will be very helpful so far as main-
tenance of the 15 p.c. to the ords. is
concerned.
Last term’s record turnover (amount
not stated), to which the pref. capital, a
new branch office and warehouse in
Adelaide, and acquisition of A. Flavell
Pty., sheet-metal workers, etc. (Mel-
bourne), contributed more than took care
of the rise in overhead and production
costs. After allowing £3696 for depre-
ciation and something for taxation, profit
was £6063 stronger at £31,375. That
covered the pref. div. and 23.1 p.c. on
ord. capital as against 19.2, 25.7, 19.4,
11.5 and 22 p.c. back to 1946.

£43,013 more debtors’ balances the co.
added £101,436 to the outside debt, of
which £133,190 (up £54,724) is coming to
the bank. There was 20s. lid. of out-
side money in the business for every
pound belonging to shareholders. Hence
the new pref. issue.
While credit restrictions may retard
turnover a little, the import cuts will help
rather than hinder the co.’s activities.

King Island Scheelite (1947), Ltd.
Operating on King Island, Bass Strait,
this Melbourne-controlled co, has far
exceeded the most optimistic expecta-
tions formed of it on reconstruction about
five years ago, when war left it over-
capitalised because of a strategic loan
from the Government. The rocket-like
ascent of profits and of the price of
the scrip have followed the market for
the metal, which has been forced up by
international developments. And the co.
has entered into contracts (terms not dis-
closed) for sale of its concentrates to
U.S. (about six years to run) and U.K.
(about four years run).
Last term 28 p.c. more overburden
(180,230 tons) was removed, and 4255

15th SECURITY LOAN
Mr. F, E. Tilley , Chairman of the Associated
Stock Exchanges of Australia , emphasises
benefits of Loan investment.
"All Governments,” says Mr. F. E. Tilley,
"have undertaken long-range schemes
for national progress and development,
and to this end the Commonwealth
Government is now inviting subscrip-
tions to the 15 th Security Loan.
"As Chairman of the Associated Stock
Exchanges of Australia, I would urge
all those with available funds, from £lO
upwards, to take advantage of this
opportunity to make an investment that
will give them security of capital, liquidity
of holdings and regularity of income.
"It cannot be stressed too strongly,”
Mr. Tilley maintains, "that although progress
and development depend upon savings,
these must be organised and consolidated,
and the Stock Exchanges are justly
proud of the tradition they have
established in playing their part in
this great task.
"They will again make available
all their facilities in a co-operative
effort to ensure the success of
this Loan, and members will
gladly handle subscriptions
without cost to the investor.”

160 p.c., as against 20 p.c. for
the previous term. Of the £79,921
that remained, £50,000 was ear-
marked for expenditure on de-
velopment and/or new plant. It
is expected that installation of a
new Marcy type mill and 22 more
tables will lift the throughput of
ore about 50 p.c. by the end of

margin of profit per unit should
benefit, provided wage-rates don’t

the basis of current output and
prices, profit at next balancing
date promises to equal or exceed
last term’s figure.

The easing of the price since mid-
-1951 is due to the fact that tung-
sten is now under international
control. Buying quotas, central-
ised national purchase and an
international price ceiling of
£S26 per unit f.o.b. have eased
the scramble for ore and con-
centrates, and marginal expan-
sion of output through new
developments and reopening of
old properties is constantly tak-
ing place. However, supplies of
tungsten-bearing ores from China,
Korea and Burma —the world’s
principal producers before the
war —are still interrupted, and
demand remains strong.
At Oct. 31 last the co.’s ore
reserves were put at 2,465,736
tons proved and payable, with
prospects of more pay-stuff being
developed. Current assets total-
led £1,266,806 and current
liabilities, including the final div.,
£1,084,529.
The ss. shares, which rocked
from 275. to a peak of 695. 6d.

Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Pianist Walter Gieseking presents
such an aspect of genial benevolence that
he easily “wins all hearts.” He also
presents a brand of broken English and
simple ingenuousness that are hard to
resist.
However, the maestro doesn’t display
the same geniality on the concert platform.
The tremendous ovation the kind-hearted
Sydney audience accorded him didn’t
bring a single smile on Saturday night.
A man fainted during the Bach concerto
and everybody thought it was a demon-
stration beginning, but otherwise all was
rapt attention. How much effort this
costs is shown (it seems to this Letter, at
any rate) by the almost imperceptible
sigh of pleasure and relaxation that greets
such familiar works as “Clair de Lune.”
Our audiences might not be so highly
educated musically as some others, but
no one can deny that they do try hard.
Two receptions were given for Gieseking
during the week, both very well
attended. The Musical Association held
theirs at the Troc., where the president,
Faunce Allmann, welcomed 200 members,
including, among many of Sydney’s well-
known music-lovers, Frank Hutchens,
Lindley Evans, Godfrey Stirling, the
Alfred Hills, the R. J. Boyers, William
James, Kathleen Dempsey, Gladys Hart,
Mrs. Russell Davis, Mrs. Frank Mc-
Guinness, Mrs. Richard Gloster and Vera
and Beatrice Keame.
At the reception given by the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra committee, atten-
tion was divided between the pianist and
the wonderful floral display arranged by
the ladies. With red flowers predominat-
ing, dahlias particularly, some of the
arrangements were professional in design
and execution. Doubtless they made an
impression on Gieseking, who said that
he was known as the pianist who works
in his garden. This seemed remarkable
when considered against the beauty and
delicacy of his hands, but as it is
true perhaps he should be made an
honorary member of our Garden Club.
Lady Anderson received the guests at the
reception. Mr. Boyer made a speech, so
did Mr. Moses. Everyone seemed to
notice Mrs. C. R. McKerihan’s toque
decorated with lustrous grapes. Dorothy
Helmrich wore dark red, Mrs. Hope
Gibson was in black and Mrs. Rose
Taplin made the wisest choice for the
exhaustingly hot day, cool white trimmed
with guipure lace.
Overheard while waiting a long time
for a tram in George-street: “Oh, dear,
this is a waste of time. 1 wish I’d brought
my knitting.”
The grounds of Admiralty House are
looking quite lovely at present with the
flowers all glowing and blooming as if
the Royal visit hadn’t been postponed at
all. On Saturday afternoon Admiralty
House must have been one of the
pleasantest spots in Sydney, with the
brilliant sunshine and the fresh nor’-easter
blowing off the harbor. The 300 or so
people who attended the fete in aid of the
N.S.W. College of Nursing seemed to find
it delightful, at any rate. Lady Mayoress
(in a glamorous cyclamen hat) opened
the fete and was accompanied by her
cousin, Mrs. H. Timbrell. They were
welcomed by Miss M. Lions, president
of the college, and Miss J, Bromell.
Mannequins glided along the lovely
colonnade of the House, Chips Rafferty
sold tickets for the chocolate-wheel with
the greatest of ease, dear little boy-scouts
ran errands, and trig-looking nurses served
afternoon-tea with commendable promp-
titude.
The Borovansky Ballet’s performance
in their repeat season of “Swan Lake,”
“Petrouchka” and “Le Beau Danube”
brought two critiques from the dailies
next morning, one headed “Borovansky
Ballet at its Best,” the other “Ballet not
at its Best.” The kindliest woman in
town says that perhaps one critic thinks
that perfection has been reached and that
the other believes the Borovansky Ballet
always has something in reserve.
Mrs. Quentin Stanham opened the
exhibition of paintings by New Australian
Julius Szentleleky at the Grosvenor
Galleries, as the artist’s wife is a long-
standing friend of hers. Mrs. Stanham
said that if she looked rather grim in
Szentleleky’s portrait of her it was
because he had chosen quite the coldest
room in the house for the sittings. Society
was well represented at the showing,
scanners including Mrs. Bertram Wright,
Mrs. Hubert Gordon, Mrs. Harry
Dangar, Mrs. Vincent Fairfax (in a nice
bright-red beret), Mr. and Mrs. Derek
Bennell, Mrs. Harold Dew, Mrs. George
McArthur Onslow and Mrs. H. A.
Showers with daughter Barbara.
“Women in this changing world” is
fast becoming the favorite subject for
talks by distinguished women speakers.
Latest to express views on the subject
was Mrs. Israel Brodie, who is the wife
of the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew
Congregations of the British Common-
wealth of Nations. She spoke at a re-
ception given for her by the National
Council of Women, at which there was
a very good attendance by representatives
of 250 women’s organisations. Her
theme seemed to be that women in this
changing world are very like women of
other times and that women are modern
in their own time.
Here is a picture by Laurie le Guay of
Gwen Harrison, very well-known in this
town for her work in repertory, par-
ticularly with the Metropolitan Theatre
group. Her current activity is producing
“Twelfth Night,” which opens at the
Met. tomorrow night. The script she is
following is that used in the first produc-
tion at Middle Temple Hall in 1601. In
later productions some variations were
made, but the original version, she thinks,
gives better continuity to the plot. New
costumes have been designed for the pro-
duction, including an elaborate wedding-
gown of pink, silver and gold, to be worn
by Olivia in the final scene.
What a long time the swimming season
has lasted! It began early, and this past
sunny weekend has brought it well into
the middle of March. The beaches were
crowded with people, mostly tanned a
horrid mahogany shade. If they had been
baked in an oven one would throw them
away as being over-done. To see suntan
at its best one must go to the beaches
about the middle of January. After that
it begins to deteriorate. It is curious to
note what people seem to think correct
in beachwear. To go home some put on
a skirt over their swimsuits, others put
on a sweater. Seldom does one see the
two being donned by the one person.
Perhaps it is that these garments are
merely a concession to decency, not a
serious attempt to cover up the
mahogany.
Senora Dona Rafael de Romero (who
will be remembered as the former Mrs.
Lebbeus Hordern of Sydney) is due in
Fremantle by the Strathnaver on March
25. Her plans are to join the trans-
continental railway for Sydney, where
she will stay at the Australia. In Perth
her port of call will be the Esplanade
Hotel; in Adelaide (on March 26) the
South Australia ; and in Melbourne (on
28th) Menzies. These details are given
because the senora is anxious to get in
touch with her old war-time friends whom
as prisoners-of-war she supplied with
books, games, papers, food and clothing,
etc.
Reports from England that a medical
survey had shown an alarming increase
in neurasthenia bring to mind the preval-
ence here of the habit of taking head-
ache-powders. With some women these
powders are a staple item of diet; they
no longer wait to get a pain or an ache
before taking one, they pour one into
their mouths “just in case.” It is quite
reliably reported that the girls in one
particular factory (where nobody works
exceptionally hard) automatically order a
packet of headache-powders with their
lunch every day. Many of these girls are
married and run a house as well as a
job—a feat which perhaps naturally cries
aloud to heaven for headache-powders.
From Melbourne
The long tenure at Adelaide’s Govern-
ment House of Sir Willoughby and Lady
Norrie, brought to a close by Sir Wil-
loughby’s transference to the big vice-
regal job in New Zealand, was notable
for the free and simple manner in which
their Excellencies identified themselves
with practically every aspect of the State’s
activities and with community life. In
particular Lady Norrie took a special
interest in women on the land, for whom
she often expressed warm admiration.
The graciousness and sincerity which have
made her so popular everywhere were
marked in the message she gave when the
news of her husband’s new appointment
came through. Among the lasting
memories she would take with her, she
said, were the things which had so deeply
impressed her when first she came to
South Australia: the extraordinary kindli-
ness and friendliness of the people, the
wonderful climate, and, of course, the
flowers and the fruit. “And we have a
special link with South Australia,” she
added, “in that our youngest child, Anna-
bel, was born here, and Adelaide is her
second name.”
The private view at Lower Melbourne
Town Hall of the loan exhibition ol
antiques was opened on Friday night by
Lady Brooks. In aid of Y.W.C.A. and the
British Memorial Fund, the exhibition,
arranged by a committee of true enthus-
iasts under the chairmanship of Louis
Nelken, is remarkable not only for the
exhibits themselves but for the artistry
with which they have been arranged.
Among those who have been working
hard for its success are Lady Gullett and
her daughter, Mrs. Paul Hackforth Jones,
Lady Murdoch, Brigadier and Mrs. Harry
Buhdock, Mrs. Simon Warrender, Mrs.
G. R. Nicholas, Mrs. John Baillieu, Mrs.
M. L. Baillieu, Mrs. Winton Gillespie,
Mrs. G. Lord, Mrs. Paddy Carter, Joyce
Truelove, Mrs. Jim Fitzgerald and Mrs.
Caroline Isaacson. The exhibition is now
open to the public (admission 25.) from
10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, Sundays 2 p.ra.
to 5.30 p.m.
Loveday Hills, pictured here, has been
seen in many Little Theatre and profes-
sional productions. Recently she toured
England and the Continent with Irene
Mitchell, a director of the Little
Theatre, studying drama and adding to
her collection of a glass menagerie. Dur-
ing the day Loveday is with a leading
bookseller in this city and for the next
three weeks her evenings will be spent at
the Little Theatre, where she is leading
lady in “The Madwoman of Chaillot,” a
play by Jean Giraudoux, produced by
Irene Mitchell. Preview of the play was
given for the Wilson Hall Theatre Arts
Fund.
At Gieseking’s fourth Melbourne
recital before moving on to Sydney
singer John Brownlee and wife were in
the party arranged by Conrad Charlton
and wife, who were accompanied by
schoolgirl-daughter Diana. Lady Scott
and Lady Angliss were there, as were Mrs.
Norman Robinson and her daughter,
Mrs. Josh. Pitt. Gertrude Johnson left the
National Theatre Opera Co. at the
Princess to listen to the masterly inter-
pretation of Paradisi, Schumann,
Debussy and Ravel. At the concert, too,
were Mrs. Frank Tait, whose emerald-
green gloves matched the cluster of roses
pinned in the bodice of her green-and-
black-spotted frock, Mrs. F. H. Wright,
with her daughter, Mrs. Ronald Marriott,
and producer John Casson, with his
wife Pianist Ruth Farrin Price was with
the Rudy Himmers. Also, Vera Brad-
ford and Mrs. Guy Bakewell were there.
The Air Force Women’s Association
hopes to begin its scholarship fund with
a preview of the Arthur J. Rank picture,
“Lavender Hill Mob,” at the Union
Theatre on March 22. President is again
Mrs. E. C. Wackett, and Mrs. E. Sinclair
is in charge of plan and bookings. The
film, which stars Alec Guiness and
Stanley Holloway, was rated in America
the outstanding one of 1951. Reserved
seats will cost 7s. 6d., unreserved 6s. ; all
proceeds to the fund, which is to provide
scholarships for children of airmen killed
or incapacitated in the last war.
From the Vic. Division of Red Cross
comes news that chairman of the 1952
Red Cross Ball is Dame Mary Daly. The
ball will be held on March 31 in St.
Kilda Town Hall. Tickets, £2 2s. each,
from Mrs. Hugh McKenzie, Hawthorne
4215, Mrs, Jim Peters, WA3235, Mrs. W.
Calanchini, FU3534 and Miss J. Collins,
LF9312. Mrs. Eccles McKay and Mrs.
V. P. Cahill are in charge of decorations.
Autumn millinery, inspired by a recent
visit overseas by the sisters Yvonne and
Patric Whittam, made a charming display
when quietly shown in their small salon.
Most of the hats are in warm-toned peach-
bloom velours, velvets and melusine, and
are cosy and fitting close to the face.
They vary in shape from small shovel-
brimmed helmets to flat little berets,
from flattering face-hugging cloches to
small caps made entirely of feathers. A
very special model is for a special
occasion and was inspired by one Patric
saw in Paris. A cloche of wine and lilac-
toned ostrich feathers set across a coral-
pink felt crown is fashioned to sweep
over the ears at each side. A bonnet of
white melusine had for trimming a
large emerald-green feather-wing and
another of white melusine with a forward-
sloping brim was underlined with white
grosgrain and with jet scattered on the
underbrim and soft crown. Ocelot velvet
made a helmet with modified ear-muffs.
The helmet motif was repeated in one of
bright red velours. Very flattering to the
wearer was a black peach-bloom velour,
which featured a flat crown and was
draped softly away from the face ; it had
an all-over trimming of small tufts of
black silk fringe in tiny gold mounts.
No woman could be bored at a fashion-
show presented by Royal milliner Aage
Tharrup. His sense of theatre and tim-
ing, plus a fund of amusing small-talk,
is excellent. There was a reminder
of a more gracious day in the tiny
curtseys given by three teen-age manne-
quins each time they passed an older one.
When Tharrup presented his “little bit of
nonsense,” a tiny black chantilly lace
bonnet with a forward tilt and trimmed
at the back with white ermine tails, which
he calls “Nightcap,” the lights went out
and a lighted candle in the mannequin’s
hand and candelabra set near the micro-
phone shed a rosy glow over the scene.
Finally five mannequins added a dramatic
note by wearing beautiful wide-brimmed
black hats with black frocks and snow-
white Arctic furs. The most elegant hat
in the show was fashioned for “the
mother of the bride.” This was made of
orchid pink panne velvet with its side
drooping brim softly swathed with match-
ing pink feathers.
The Children’s Hospital and Legacy
benefited from Tharrup’s show, and Lady
Latham, president of the hospital, was
present, as was the Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
John Inkster, who chose a black faille
jacket-suit and wide-brimmed black
straw-hat. Mrs. A. G. Silk and Mrs.
Norman Bennett were together, and Mrs.
Peter Lynch was with her sister, Pat
Christie. The latter, who leaves shortly
for overseas, was attractive in a frock
which featured a beige - and - white
embroidered bodice and full beige moire
taffeta skirt. Mrs. A. E. Shilliday was
there with daughter Wanda, and another
interested spectator was Lillian Wight-
man, whose stunning frock of black
paper taffeta had graduated accordion-
pleated frills adorning the short bouffant
skirt.

EXIDE BATTERIES OF AUSTRALIA PTY.LTD.,44 BRIDGE STREET. SYDNEY

PERSONAL ITEMS
When a Bulletin artist sketched Sir
Willoughby Norrie back in 1944 (on his
becoming Governor of South Australia),
the caricaturist found his subject facially
somewhat like Lord Gowrie and
possessed also of many of the charac-
teristics which made that G.-G. popular.
Now Sir Wallaby (as he admits he is
often called) furthers the likeness by be-
coming a G.-G. himself. And in his war
record he approaches similarity to the
man he relieves Freyberg, V.C.,
Governor - General of New Zealand.
Against the Kaiser Sir Willoughby col-
lected D. 5.0., M.C. and Bar, a brace of
“mentions” and four wounds. In Hitler’s
scrap he commanded the British Ist
Armored Division and, later, the 30th
Corps in the Middle East. Fifty-eight,
he was created K.C.M.G. the year he
came to South Australia.
After a bare half-dozen years in Par-
liament, Neil O’Sullivan has become,
second to his fellow-Bananalander
Treasurer Fadden, the economic pan-
jandrum of Australia. As Trade and
Customs Minister he’ll have a weighty
word in the matter of what shall enter
under the import restrictions. Bora in
Brisbane, schooled at Nudgee College
there, he has been a solicitor, and, as
evidence of his qualification for his
present post, president of the Brisbane
Chamber of Commerce. He’s done good
deeds as an executive of the Flying
Doctor Service and the Boy Scouts’
Association. Fifty-one.
Having heard it on the radio, a Mel-
bourne “Herald” correspondent asked
who wrote the song, “I’m Going Back
Again to Yarrawonga,” the old Digger
tune which took the place of “Tipperary”
in the ranks of the A.I.F. The author-
ship is confessed to by Bulletin cari-
caturist Mcßeath. A corporal draughts-
man in France attached to the staff of
General Monash (who specially valued
the sketches he made of the terrain
around Messines), Mcßeath, wounded
in the foot, was being carried back on
a stretcher when he was overtaken by
another wounded Digger. “I’ll be going
back to England,” Mcßeath said, “And
I’ll be going back to Yarrawonga,”
remarked the other. Thus inspired,
Mcßeath wrote the words and music, and
when in London showed it to his old
theatrical acquaintance Ella Shields, who
put it across the footlights. Mcßeath
has composed many songs since, but his
present job is flitting around Australia
in aeroplanes getting ideas for displays
for T.A.A. windows.
“Macnell” on some black-gangers:
A turn of the screw in the R.A.N. engineering
heirarchy puts Roger Parker Fleet Engineer
Officer, repository for all the seagoing worries;
Johnny Bull (who as principal naval overseer
at Cockatoo watched over Voyager’s growth)
on the staff of the High Commissioner in
London; Charles Clark from the H.C.’s office
to Director of Engineering at Navy Office; and
Walter Armitage, whom Clark replaces, in
charge of the Navy’s torpedo-works in Sydney.
Parker stood-by the building of our destroyers
Norman and Nepal, on their completion went
to sister-ship Nestor, was in her when the
Luftwaffe got into her boiler-rooms in a Malta
convoy; got out of that and had Hobart’s
72,000 horses when she, with Chicago and
Australia, blocked the Nip’s invasion force
headed for Moresby in the early stages of what
developed into the battle of the Coral Sea.
For this, 0.8. E. Bull, short, cheerful, quick-
stepping, took over Hobart after her torpedo-
damage and drove her up through Borneo and
adjacent hot-spots to Tokyo Bay. Clark, after
supervising the fitting-out of such heavies as
Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary and Aquitania,
was also up in Philippine waters, boss of what
made cruiser Australia tick. He had a nice
job repairing her after suicide-bombers had
made a pin-cushion of her upper-works. It
brought him D.S.C. Armitage won the prize
for theoretical engineering on passing-out at
Flinders, and leamt enough about the practical
side in the engine-rooms of cruisers Brisbane
and Adelaide to give him his three commander’s
rings by the time he took over in Shropshire
early in the war. He was with Shropshire at
Leyte when his squadron-mate Clark was carry-
ing out his unauthorised repairs across the way.
Parker and Bull are 46, Clark and Armitage
49, captains all.
Celebrated her 104th birthday in Clunes
(Vic.), Mrs. Laura Hudson, who arrived
in Melbourne with her parents from
Berkshire in 1852. She told a surprise-
party organised by the local Church of
England that she and her family passed
through Ballarat on the way to Clunes
while the business of the Eureka Stockade
was on. She also said there was nothing
much wrong with her today except a bit
of sciatica.
“Cauboy”: I have pleasant memories of Ben
Fuller, because the little grey gnome once lent
me a tenner when I lost my wallet on a Sydney-
Melbourne railway-journey, though he didn’t
know me from a bar of soap, and certainly
didn’t know I had often been a trenchant critic
of his public entertainments. Of course, a
millionaire can do that —but he wasn’t a
millionaire then. The ex-blackface comedian of
Brighton sands was a dreamer. Although the
stuff he put on at his various theatres was
seldom above box-office level, he dreamed of
putting on some really great play, and read
hundreds of MSS. by modern playwrights from
the U.S. and England without discovering the
play that would give him artistic prestige, even
if he lost heavily on it. He did, however,
do something nobody else had dared to do in
Melbourne: based a grand-opera season at the
old Apollo on Wagner, invited Austral (the
greatest Wagnerian singer then existing), Walter
Widdop, the Welsh bard, and Horace Stevens
to sing in it, and lost a mint of money. He
spent £22,000 on the cast and £l5OO on the
orchestra before the curtain went up on “Aida”;
the eight rehearsals of the 40 musicians for
“The Valkyrie” ran away with £1500; but the
result was an artistic triumph. If he had con-
tinued along those lines he might have been
assured of the same immortality with regard to
the theatre as Alfred Felton is with regard to
painting. But he kept up his interest in the
footlights, and at 76 was still engaged in making
the rounds of backstage London on the night
he died. The films recouped him for his legit,
losses, and he went on making money, although
he always said he would like to die a pauper.
Over 50 years in advertising and still
smiling at Father Time, W. O. (“Billy”)
Richards started as a copy-writer and
climbed through space-selling, editing and
publishing to the managing-directorship
of the Weston Company, one of Sydney’s
largest concerns in the boost business.
Bom in Newtown, Sydney, when that
house-packed area was a sorghum-field
and dairy-farm, Billy was orphaned at 11,
BILLY RICHARDS.
and went immediately to work; drifted
early into the selling and publishing busi-
ness, joined his present company in 1906
—Harry Weston and Claude Wilmott
had started it —and bought it out two
years later. Mentor, in their youth, of
many of the big names in advertising to-
day, Richards put between covers his em-
bracing knowledge of the game in the
form of The Australian Advertisers
Manual and Newspaper Directory, which
had a world-wide sale. Artist
Prior (who, when he is not filling
space with caricatures, sells it for adver-
tising) went forth from the sketching in-
terview with the g.o.m. of advertising
like a new man.
Caught at work by Mcßeath, Walter
Gieseking (in Australia under A.B.C.
auspices), has one of the widest repertoires
of leading piano-virtuosi, though his par-
ticular fancy turns to Schubert, Chopin
and Debussy. Bora in Lyons (France)
of a German medico-father who
specialised in entomology, Gieseking
began his public ivory-tickling early—at
WALTER GIESEKING.
four and a half. He waited till the com-
paratively prime age of 18 before making
his next appearance, having studied in
between at the Hanover Conservatorium
under Karl Leimer. From then on—
with a four-year break when the Kaiser
called the tune —Gieseking’s climb was
sure and sensational. He toured Europe,
appeared in New York, and first played
in England in 1923. Regarded as possibly
the finest living exponent of both classical
and modern music, he has taken a turn
at composing as well —quintet for piano,
oboe, clarinet and bassoon; sonatina for
flute and piano. A heavy man over 6ft.,
with a mild expression circled by an
appropriately silver tonsure, Gieseking
combines his father’s science with
mountain-climbing as his recreation.
Visiting Melbourne, the Very Rev.
Brother Edward Clancy, Superior-
General of the Christian Brothers and
controller of one of the largest teaching
institutions in the world. He’ll go from
Australia to inspect the C.Bs. in New
Guinea and New Zealand, A personal
friend of the Pope, he was a courier for
the Vatican in the late war, and crossed
the military frontiers between the con-
tending armies more times than he can
remember, locating servicemen who were
missing from both sides. He comes from
Tipperary, whence Edmund Ignatius
Rice, the Irish businessman who founded
the order in 1802, also hailed.
In 1937 the steel spine of what was to
be Britain’s most powerful motor-ship
was laid. Standing -by Dominion
Monarch, watching her 27,000-odd tons
grow upwards and outwards, was Alfred
Gibson, known to high and low as
“Gibby.” He’s been the Monarch’s chief-
engineer ever since—his tubby, jolly
figure becoming known to thousands of
Diggers Middle East bouncf. He knew
their fathers as well —in the Arawa he
took reinforcements to England, and
brought home wounded from Gallipoli
and France. When the Monarch
sails from Australia shortly, Gibby
will be taking her home for the
last time. And, no doubt, in the
home at Eltham, Kent, where he’ll
gradually breathe out the furnace-fumes
of a lifetime’s engineering, he will have
displayed in its glass-case the treasured
bowler-hat with which tradition crowns
the heads of all engineers who stand-by
the building of ships. A C.B.E. came
his way for solid service in the late war.
Died in Melbourne, Frank Hart, one
of the best-known and -liked of Aus-
tralian racing-writers. Between 1930 and
1940 he wrote The Bulletin’s Mel-
bourne turf-notes, and at various times
had been chief racing-writer for the
“Sporting Globe” and the Melbourne
“Sun” and “Herald” under the nib-names
“Stromboli” and “Khedive.” A graceful
writer* with something the same memory
for personalities and horses that a piano-
virtuoso has for notes, he could reminisce
for hours, especially about his great
friend James Scobie, whose My Life on
the Australian Turf Frank ghosted. That
book, and his own Turf Men and
Memories, were bestsellers in sporting
circles. He was 82.
“Trinco”: In the last few years of the
Conservative party’s period in Opposi-
tion, London papers were talking of
Richard Austen Butler as a coming man
—now, in with his Budget, he’s arrived.
Still on the lee-side of 50, a painstaking
scholarly politician of 23 years’ standing,
he was born at Attock Serai (India), when
his father, Sir Montagu Butler, was at the
beginning of what was to be a distin-
guished career in the Indian Civil Service.
Son followed father in several steps —
both educated at Pembroke College,
Cambridge, where Sir Montagu, after his
Indian service, had been for 11 years
master; father, secretary to the Indian
Government’s Education Department;
son, Under-Secretary of State for India,
and, for four years of War 11, the British
Government’s Minister of Education.
Conservative member for Saffron Walden
since 1929, R.A.B. (origin of the
universally-used nickname, Rab) has
established a solid reputation for com-
petence in his bore most of
the burden of the India Bill, and his
Education Act is the foundation of
Britain’s present schooling system. He
is married to the daughter of the late
Samuel Courtauld (the industrialist who
founded the famed Courtauld Institute
for art).
In Melbourne, renewing acquaintance
with his family after 44 years’ separation,
Fred Bieri, of the International Red
Cross. Of Swiss parentage, he was born
in England, but when the family
migrated to Australia he stayed behind
to study art in Munich. Then he returned
to Switzerland and became a major in the
Swiss Army. In War II with Military
Intelligence and the Red Cross, for the
last two years he has alternated between
Japan and the Korean shambles. In
all his Red Cross peregrinations he has
struck only one frontier which barred
him —the boundary between South and
North Korea. He has been on official
visits to Peking, which has its Red Ten —
the Chinese equivalent of the Red Cross,
based on the fact that the figure “ten”
resembles a cross; which organisation
Bieri claims is very efficient. Yet in
North Korea, where it would be expected
to be most needed, there is no sign of it.
Bieri has visited every p.-0.-w. camp in
South Korea.
Into the Silence:
In Los Angeles (U.S.), Alan Harkness, Mel-
bourne actor and producer, killed when a
goods-train struck his motor-van. After founding
an experimental theatre in Melbourne, which
ran for some years, he went to England and
started a school for drama with Michael
Chekhov, a nephew of Anton Chekhov.
At Dargaville (N.Z.), at 87, Thomas James
Young, whose war-service dated 30 years before
the Kaiser’s war, in which he also took part.
A member of the relief-expedition which went
to Khartoum in the unsuccessful attempt to
succour Gordon, Young could wear, as well
as his War I medals, the Khedive Star for
service against the Dervishes in 1882-85.
In Adelaide, at 61, a few days after he
returned from a tour of U.K. and the Con-
tinent, Patrick William Rice, a leading Adelaide
gynaecologist. While at Adelaide University he
topped every year of his course, leaving with
four scholarships and the Elder Prize in his
bag. Surgeon to the SA. Trotting Club for
years, he helped organise the annual Anzac
trotting-meetjng, funds from which went to the
Diggers’ Distress Fund. He gained his own
Digger experience as a medico-captain with
the Australian force which landed in New
Guinea in War I.
In Melbourne, at 80, John Thomas Saxton,
one-time chief-inspector of primary schools in
Victoria. Son of a pioneer family in the
Numurkah district, he leaves his name on the
title-page of several textbooks on physics and
chemistry.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
“Shadow-chaser”: Cattle are
not “fattened on fodder grown
on rich river-flats by sprinkler-
irrigation,” as “M.S.” (B.
27/2/’52) suggests, and are never
likely to be, simply because it
would not pay. Cost of
production and distribution
rules it right out. Calves bred
on the highlands of vast cattle-
runs, unacquainted with fences,
would need secure yards before
“young men trained in soil-
culture and fodder-raising of
cattle” could get within feeding-
distance of them.
Hand-feeding is only practic-
able with quiet cattle reared
“down on the farm” in retail
lots. Ninety per cent, of cattle
in Northern Australia are mass-
produced on big runs and rarely
see a man on foot, are rarely
yarded. If weaned and con-
fined on small areas suitable for
hand-feeding they would be dog-
poor before they settled down,
even if the fences held them.
No use suggesting leaving their
dams with them, as they arc as
wild as their progeny and far
more dangerous.
Irrigation is only profitable
when used for products yielding
hundreds of pounds per acre—
such as fruit and vegetables, and
to lesser extent fat lambs. The
labor costs involved in those in-
dustries, though serious, are not
ruinous as they would be in
mass-production of baby beef.
The average landholder, be he
beef-squatter, wheatgrower or
wool king, is just as able an
authority in his own line as
engineers, novelists, and news-
paper correspondents.
N.T. Settlement.
“Outback”: J. H. Kelly,
Bureau of Agricultural
Economics, Canberra, who
spent about four years on a
station-to-station survey of the
Northern Territory, do übts
whether even 250 graziers could
be settled on the 250,000 sq.
miles of so-called “beautiful
grazing country” there. At
today’s values it would cost
£200,000 to establish each cattle-
man.
It had been stated, said
Kelly, that an annual turn-off
of 1000 head of cattle would
mean a good living for a N.T.
cattleman, but, assuming that a
grazier obtained 1000 sq. miles
of the good country there, he
would have to improve it before
it could carry the 10,000 head
necessary to give an annual
turn-off of 1000 head.
At £lO per head the cattle
would cost £lOO,OOO, and the
improvements would cost more
than £lOO,OOO (he itemised
details of improvements neces-
sary). He estimated the
potential carrying capacity of
the Territory as about 1,600,000
head, against the 1,000,000 head
it is now carrying.
To achieve a carrying-capacity
of 1,600,000 head three essentials
were required; (1) Station im-
provements; (2) transport
facilities; (3) security of tenure.
The annual turn-off, mainly
store cattle, was difficult to
assess, but he estimated that
during the last few years the
average annual turn-off was
120,000 head, and when fully im-
proved the optimum turn-off
would be 300,000.
Rail-transport facilities con-
sidered necessary by Kelly were
a line from Newcastle Waters to
Dajarra (Q.), also from north to
south; rail extensions from
Yaralla to Windorah; Dajarra
to Boulia; and Quilpie to
Eromanga.
Kelly estimated that it would
cost graziers alone £l6 million
to step-up the cattle population
of the Territory from a million
to 16 million, and he said it
would take from 10 to 15 years
to implement his suggested pro-
gramme. All the same, he felt
it would give a satisfactory
return on capital invested.
Feeding Bees.
“Drone B.”: Fodder-con-
servation is just as essential for
apiarists as for other farmers.
Sealed honey is by far the best
feed for bees. It is their natural
foodstuff and no substitute will
give the same results.
Good combs of sealed honey
are the best. If they are not
available then liquid honey may
be used. It should be fed to the
bees in feeders inside the hive.
It is essential that honey to be
fed to bees should be absolutely
disease-free. If there is any
doubt as to the source of the
honey, or any suspicion of
disease in the apiary it comes
from, it should not be used.
If honey is not available,
sugar-syrup is a convenient sub-
stitute. It may be prepared by
mixing two parts of white sugar
and one part of water and heat-
ing to near boiling, with constant
stirring. The solution should
not be allowed to boil, as the
sugar may tend to caramelise,
with results detrimental to the
bees.
A convenient feeder may be
made from a 71b, friction-top
honey-tin. Some half-dozen
nail-holes are punched in the
lid. The tin is then filled with
the syrup and the lid replaced.
The tin of feed is then inverted
over the frames of the hive, two
small pieces of stick being used
to raise the tin clear of the
frames, an empty super is placed
over it and covered. Feeding
should preferably be done to-
wards evening to reduce the
tendency to robbing.
Feeding should never be done
by the use of open dishes placed
in the apiary; this is one of the
surest ways to accentuate
robbing if the tendency is there.
Victorian apiarists who are
unable to obtain the necessary
quantities of white sugar from
local supplies should apply to
State Agriculture Department
for a permit to obtain special
supplies of white sugar for bee-
feeding.
Grow Your Own.
“Sundowner”: Raise seedlings
of cabbage and its kindred in a
bed in a high part of the garden,
likely to be free from clubroot.
Lime the bed at per square
yard three months before seed-
ing. When about to sow apply
a light dressing of super, and
work to a fine tilth. Sow in
drills Sin. apart.
To check seed-borne diseases
place a 4gal. tin in a box con-
taining insulated material, half-
fill with boiling water, and when
the temperature has fallen to
123 deg. suspend the seed in it
in a muslin bag. The tempera-
ture will drop to 122 deg., and
this should be maintained. Give
Brussels sprouts and cauliflower
seed 20 minutes, cabbage 25
minutes. Dry the seed in the
sun and store in a clean con-
tainer. After eight to 10 weeks
seedlings should be ready for
transplanting.
Perennial Rye.
“My”: The basis of most
improved pastures in Victorian
districts where rainfall exceeds
22in., perennial rye is suited by
heavy or medium soils, making
best growth in autumn, winter
and spring. It is very hardy, per-
sisting through a dry summer
and responding immediately to
summer and early autumn rains.
In an attempt to clear up some
confusion that exists because of
the numerous names applied to
this grass, Vic. Department of
Agriculture points out that the
term “perennial rye-grass” em-
braces English rye-grass, Irish
rye-grass, Irish Ben, New
Zealand, Hawkes Bay, Poverty
Bay and Western District rye-
grasses. Victorian farmers are
advised to choose Government
certified seed harvested from old
stands in their own State, and
as their second choice seed pro-
duced under nearly similar con-
ditions in Tasmania or New
Zealand,
The Victorian strains
make better growth during
winter and go ahead more
rapidly earlier in the spring than
imported ones. Leaves of the
local product are slightly longer
and broader than the importa-
tions.
Cheaper Pastures.
“M”: To cut down the cost
of establishing pastures many
farmers are turning to simpler
mixtures and are using certified
seed. This seed costs a little
more than uncertified, but the
high percentage germinable re-
duces the usual seeding rate.
Some of the less complex
mixtures recommended by Vic.
Department of Agriculture are;
Areas with an average rainfall
of 25in, to 30in., certified peren-
nial rye 101 b. and Mt. Barker
sub, clover 21b. an acre; 20in,
to 25in., Phalaris tuberpsa 21b.
and Mt. Barker or Bacchus
Marsh sub. 21b.; 30in. (fertile
soil), perennial rye 101 b., Vic.
or N.Z. cocksfoot 41b., N.Z.
white clover ilb., Mt. Barker or
Tallarook sub. 21b. and cow-
grass 11b.
Super, at a bag to the acre
should go in with the seed.
Windbreaks.
“Myrr”; A windbreak for a
citrus grove should be of trees
that won’t harbor red scale.
Boobialla is one. It is hardy and
provides dense shelter up to a
height of 30ft. Sugar-gums
lopped to force out growth near
the ground are also suitable. Both
“Hang on, Dad — they're coming !"
are easily propagated, Boobialla
by cuttings, the eucalypt from
seed.
Plan the windbreak to give
maximum protection yet not
entirely shut in the grove, as this
prevents normal air drainage,
increasing risk of frost and
attack by fungus diseases, which
flourish in a stagnant atmos-
phere.
Between the breakwind and
the first row of fruit-trees leave
a headland of 30 to 40ft. to
minimise root interference.
Occasionally trim the roots by
cutting a shallow trench parallel
with the windbreak.
Pig-feeding.
“My”: When the quantity of
skim-milk fed to pigs is as low
as £gal. daily, a lime-lick will be
necessary. Allow each pig loz.
daily of a mixture of four parts
of ground limestone and one
part of common salt.
If less than |gal. of milk is
fed, build up the protein con-
tent of the ration by providing
meat-meal —|lb. of this is
equivalent in protein value to
Igal. of skim-milk.
On either food the young pig
will need ample supplies of
green feed or 11b. daily of
chaffed lucerne hay. Cereals,
well-ground, fed at the rate of
11b. a day for each 251 b. of live
weight, will complete the diet.
Keep the pigs warm by pro-
viding ample clean bedding
material. It is money well spent,
as a cold pig will need extra
food to maintain its body heat
Follow Up the Myxo.
“Lex”: For over 12 months
we have had myxomatosis virus
active amongst rabbits on a
north-west N.S.W. property. I
made a fairly close observation
of the effects, and one conclusion
is the absolute necessity of fol-
lowing up the good work done
by the virus.
By that I mean systematic and
thorough mopping-up of the last
rabbit or last warren in any pad-
dock where it appears that the
virus has made a complete kill.
The virus spreads easily and
rapidly where rabbits are thick
enough to be in reasonably close
contact over the whole of a pad-
dock, but when only a few rab-
bits are left in isolated patches,
with some distance separating
them, the incidence of the disease
becomes correspondingly lower
and may disappear altogether
from that area.
Myxomatosis is not a com-
plete eradicator of rabbits, but
it does control them to a degree
which should enable every
farmer to destroy the most im-
portant rabbit of all —the last
one.
Sugar for Seedlings.
“Reddit”: In these days of
algebraic and polysyllabic sprays
and manures, it is refreshing to
learn of an aid to horticulture
with a simple name. It is to
spray seedlings (in the seed-bed)
with a 10 p.c. sucrose solution
24 hours before transplanting.
This is simply sugar and water
in the proportion of 11b. of sugar
to Igal. of water.
Absorption of the sugar
(carbohydrate) through the
leaves stimulates root-growth
and so helps the recovery of the
plants after the shock of trans-
planting. The effects are not
remarkable when transplanting
conditions are ideal (i.e., into
moist soil in cool or cloudy
weather), but under tough con-
ditions the treatment has proved
itself.
There is no reason why it
should not equally apply to such
seedlings as French beans,
which, though not subject to
transplanting, could still benefit
from some supplementary root-
sustenance when at the two-leaf
stage under adverse conditions.
Growing Beetroot.
“Wilco”: It is much better to
sow beetroot seed thinly and
then thin out than to start plants
in a seedbox and transplant
them —at least in our N.Q.
district.
Detroit Dark Red, Turnip
Rooted and Derwent Globe are
good varieties, all with a pre-
ference for light friable soils
containing a dressing of bal-
anced fertiliser or farm-manure
and wood-ashes, and cultivated
at least 12in. deep. The Obelisk
beetroot prefers deeper con-
ditions.
The size to which beetroots
may be allowed to grow before
harvesting depends on prevailing
conditions. On good soils, with
ample rain, they may grow to a
large size without becoming
woody, but they should be har-
vested young if the season turns
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
The recent rains in North Queensland that relieved the
dry areas were partly cyclical and partly due to reaction
from fading sunspots. According to the cycle there should
be more rains, hut the weak sun is not giving them much
support.
The next important rains are those due under the cycle
late this month or/and in early April.
The prospect for the Royal Show in Sydney looks as
though it will open in rain and run through into fine
weather.

Cabbage Troubles.
“Hortus”: When cabbage-
seedlings don’t do well in spite
of spraying or dusting with
various insecticides or fungicides,
pull one up and look at the root,
If roots are swollen, forming
weird-looking bunches, with few
or no laterals, the trouble is
club-root,
As this is the work of a
parasite living underground it is
useless to spray. Soils of an
acid nature are particularly
favorable for the development
of this parasite.
If sorrel is growing in the
garden it is a sure sign of sour-
ness and acidity, due probably
to poor drainage. It’s always
best to lime the ground some
time before you plant out the
young cabbages, cauliflowers,
broccoli and other members of
this family. Air-slaked lime is
the best
The only thing to be done
when club-root is present is to
pull up the sickly plants and
bum them.
Sometimes this club-root is
confused with root-knots caused
by eelwoms or gallworms, but
the latter are much smaller,
blister-like lumps.
As young seedlings with club-
root have a wilted appearance
during the day but seem to be
normal again after a cool night
and dewy morning, the blame is
often put down to the heat.

Hints for the Farm.
“Big Billy”: A phial of 500
units of anti-tetanus serum for
sheep and lambs is enough to
inject five animals. To enable
the serum to be divided into
the appropriate dose-rates S.A.
Department of Agriculture says
to put the serum into a larger
sterile bottle and add sufficient
rain-water (or water which has
been boiled) to make the total
bulk up to sc.cs. Serum so
diluted should be used the same
day in subcutaneous injection.
“Bill C”: The climbing
Tongan bean is such a strong
grower and prolific cropper that
it should be grown more
extensively in warm districts.
Two or three planted on
different sides of a bush-house
will soon cover it. The flowers
are pretty, and the purplish
beans, borne in clusters, are
stringless and palatable. When
too many beans reach maturity
at the same time, the excess may
be picked and kept in storage.
They will dry up somewhat
when stored, but can be
refreshed by soaking in water.
“Wilco”: A neighbor wanted
to get an encrusted mass of
grease and oil out of a cordial-
bottle he intended to use for
distilled water. First he rinsed
it out with power-kerosene, then
put two or three spoonfuls of
soap-powder and several cups
of cold water in. He spun the
bottle until the inside was
covered with lather. Next he
fed in enough sand to turn the
white lather a brownish grey.
After a lot more turning of the
bottle he poured the brown soup
off and washed the bottle out in
clean water. The bottle fairly
sparkled.
“Sundowner”: Stubble-burn-
ing is bad in wind-drift country ;
in heavier country its advantages
are that weeds are destroyed,
nitrogen starvation, which may
occur in a dry season when straw
is ploughed under, will be
avoided, and fungus diseases are
checked.
“Sarina”: At the Georgia
Agricultural Experiment Station
(U.S.A.) they drilled blue lupins
into a couch-grass stand during
autumn to find out whether it
pays to green-manure an
established pasture. When the
lupins were disked in at the flower-
ing stage a few months later the
improvement in the pasture was
most marked. It was estimated
that the legume crop doubled or
trebled the amount of soil
nitrogen available to the grass.
“W. Court”: Dahlias should
always have a well-drained
position, but even then they may
be killed off by excessive rains.
A good idea is to place pieces
of tin, iron or flat boards on the
ground around the dahlias dur-
ing a wet spell to run the water
off. Remove these when the
weather clears up.
“Connoisseur”: If boracic-acid
powder is sprinkled about where
cockroaches congregate it will
stop them. Another way is to
grind sugar to a fine powder and
mix with it about 20 per cent, of
plaster of Paris. This kills
them.

Change of Diet.
I’ve just been reading a sug-
gestion by a professor who
thinks we should change our
diet —he points out that a table-
spoonful of chopped parsley
has the nutritional value of a
whole orange and that nastur-
tium-leaves are a good sub-
stitute for lettuce. He may be
right; certainly my Uncle Oliver
would have agreed with him.
Uncle was always discovering
food substitutes. “Our food
bills are too high,” he said to
Aunt Alice once. “We’ll have to
economise. Do you know that
the people of the Central Kirghiz
live on nothing but sour goats’-
milk and they live to a hundred-
and-twenty?”
“No good to us,” said Aunt
Alice ; “there isn’t a sour goat
within miles.”
“I’m just quoting that
as an example,” Uncle told her.
“The Kirghiz live on goats’-milk
because goats are plentiful in
their country. They take what
Nature gives them. We must do
the same. Take our staple foods
—meat, milk, butter, cheese. The
sheep and cows that provide
them get their nourishment from
grass. Why shouldn’t we?”
Aunt Alice couldn’t raise
much enthusiasm, but that didn’t
matter much ; Uncle had enough
for both of them. “Do you
know,” he asked, “that one
plateful of lawn-clippings has as
much nutriment as a pound-and-
a-half of chops, three sausages or
two-and-a-half eggs?” “Buffalo-
grass or couch?” asked Aunt;
but Uncle Oliver didn’t answer.
He was already on his way to
the shed to get the lawn-mower.
Breakfast next morning was a
pretty tearful meal. My cousins
and I struggled hard with our
lawn-clippings, but couldn’t get
them down. “It isn’t fair to
force them,” said Aunt Alice.
She was contenting herself with
a piece of dry toast and was full
of sympathy for our tears.
“They’ll have to eat it,” insisted
Uncle. “They’re far too faddy
about their food. I enjoyed
mine.” I don’t know whether
that was true or not, but he’d
certainly eaten it all right. “It’s
horrible stuff,” said one of my
cousins. “Nonsense,” said Uncle,
“You’ve said that about every
kind of breakfast food we’ve
had.” “It tastes like ants,”
“ Didn't you know it Was formal ?”
bawled my cousin. “Rot,” said
her father, “that’s clover-seeds.
They’re lovely. Haven’t you
noticed the way the birds go for
them?”
I suppose you can get used to
anything, and in the end we got
the horrible stuff down —that
morning and the next, and the
next. Smothering it with sugar
and drowning it with milk
helped.
Then Uncle pounced on
the milk-bill. “Cut it down,”
he ordered. “We’ll use sub-
stitutes.” “Such as what?” asked
Aunt Alice. “Crushed thistles
and poinsettia-stalks,” an-
nounced Uncle, “have twice the
protein content of cows’-milk,
not to mention their vitamin-
value. As for sugar, do you
know that the sticky stuff that
comes off paspalum is much
more nutritious than molasses?”
He was possibly right, but that
didn’t make it any more palat-
able when served up with our
breakfast lawn-clippings and
thistle - and - poinsettia milk.
After a week of it we children
felt half-starved and used to
cadge sandwiches off the other
kids at school. Uncle looked
healthy enough, but that may
have been the effect of the
parsnip-juice he drank night and
morning. He was still full of
ideas.
“I see green vegetables
are dear again,” he said. “We’ll
have to cut ’em out.” “Can’t
go without greens,” protested my
Aunt. “Don’t worry about that,”
Uncle told her. “I’ve been look-
ing at that patch of fat-hen at
the bottom of the yard. Marvel-
lous stuff. Spinach isn’t in the
race with it. We’ll eat that.”
We did, too. And not only fat-
hen. Nettle-soup, flavored with
oinion-weed, was better than
chicken-broth —or so Uncle said.
To me it tasted even more
objectionable than stewed
turnip-tops, another of his
favorites.
One of my cousins happened
to say it was a long time since
we’d had meat; a moment later
she was sorry she’d mentioned
it. “Snails!” said Uncle Oliver,
“Just the thing—and there’s
plenty in the garden.” My
cousin began to cry and Aunt
Alice said she wouldn’t allow
snails at her table. “They’re
good enough for the French,”
said Uncle, “so they’re good
enough for us. Taste like
mussels, I’m told.”
So snails were added to the
menu. I think they must have
been the last straw for
Aunt Alice. Next night
as we munched our parsley
and nasturtium-leaf salad she re-
marked, “I heard on the wire-
less today that Queen Victoria
used to simply adore rose-petal
sandwiches. Would you like to
try them?” “Sure thing,” said
Uncle Oliver. “Put some in my
cut-lunch tomorrow.” A week
later the storm burst. “Those
rose-petal sandwiches,” com-
plained Uncle as we sat down to
dinner. “I’m sick and tired of
them!” Aunt Alice looked at
him reproachfully. “But you
said you liked them,” she said.
“So I did at first,” agreed Uncle,
“but not every day of the week.
A man likes a bit of variety.”
“Variety?” said Aunt Alice,
“You’ve had it. I’ve been giv-
ing you a different variety every
day—Talisman on Monday, La
France on Tuesday and Etoile
de Hollande on Wednesday. I
mixed them on Thursday; half
Editor MacFarland and half
Gaiety. Then on Friday you had
Daily Mail and Shot Silk. Today
I made you up a delicious assort-
ment —the top layer I filled with
those lovely little Lady Hilling-
dons ; then there was a mixture
of Red Radiance and Golden
Dawn —I made sure you’d like
those —and your favorite
crimson Hadley. Tomorrow I
thought I’d” “Tomorrow
you’ll give me nothing,” roared
Uncle Oliver. “Tomorrow I’ll
buy myself a decent feed for a
change. You and your rose-petal
sandwiches! ”
Aunt Alice looked shocked.
“Well,” she said, “If they were
good enough for Queen Victoria
I think they ought to be good
enough for you.” “Huh!” said
Uncle. “All I can say is that
roses must have been different in
Queen Victoria’s time.” He
prodded at the mess on his plate,
“What’s this?” he demanded.
“Gum-leaf salad” said my Aunt.
“Gum-leaf salad!” snorted
Uncle. “What rot! There’s no
food-value i n gum-leaves,”
“Koalas eat them,” Aunt Alice
reminded him, “and what’s good
enough for koalas ought to
be”— l Uncle broke in again.
“Like hell! ” he said, pushing his
plate away. “Gimme a tin of
sardines.”
Aunt Alice fired her final shot
later in the evening. She and
Uncle Oliver were home-brew
fans with quite a reputation in
their own circle. Not long after
dinner Uncle had a hankering
for a beer ; either the rose-petals
or the sardines had given him a
thirst. Aunt Alice produced a
bottle and poured him out a
glass. Uncle raised it to his lips,
took a long pull, then spluttered
as if he were choking. “What’s
this?” he gurgled when he got
his breath back. “I’m poisoned! ”
“Horehound beer,” said Aunt
Alice. “Malt and hops are so
dear now I thought I’d try it as
a substitute.” “Substitute! ”
yelled Uncle. “Don’t you know
there’s no substitute for beer?
How much did you make?”
“The usual quantity,” said Aunt
Alice. “Five gallons.” Uncle
groaned. “Five gallons,” he re-
peated. “Pour it all down the
drain. D’ you want to kill roe?”
Next morning Aunt Alice
gave us old-fashioned oatmeal-
porridge for breakfast and Uncle
Oliver didn’t say a word.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The Honest Toiler
If there is one man who has no press-
agent, no political representative, no sup-
porter in a trade-union, and is, in short,
not recognised by anybody, that man is
the honest worker.
Where is he? Well, accuse me of blow-
ing my own bugle if you like, but I’m
one, and I can name plenty of others.
We are in the minority, perhaps, but at
least we exist. Yet nobody would ever
know it by Press reports or from the
utterances of economic experts and
politicians. It is “men won’t work these
days” or “bricklayers are not laying a
third as many bricks a day as they used
to,” etc. —just as though all men were in
the same class, and that class a degenerate
rabble of loafers.
I happen to be a bricklayer and my
output is as great per working-hour as it
was 20 years ago. In other words, I and
my type are still doing our best; if we
were offered £1 a day more to get through
more work we could not earn it; neither
could we do more if work were scarce
and our jobs depended on it.
But who would believe that? In con-
versation with strangers I always hear:
“But bricklayers don’t lay many bricks
now, do they?” Nothing will convince
them otherwise. They’ve read it so often,
and always the statement has been “brick-
layers,” not “bricklayers on a certain
cost-plus (or government) job,” nor even
“the majority of bricklayers.’''
The worst part of it is that loaf ers don’t
mind in the least; only the honest worker
squirms—for the same reasons that make
him an honest worker: he takes a pride
in his job and he has a conscience.-
Brick E (N.S.W.).
Life Assurance and Inflation
“G.A.D.” (B. 27/2/’52) complains that
a life-assurance office has suggested that
he should increase his cover because of
the present inflationary trend. He should
take their sound advice.
“G.A.D.V’ car, house and furniture are
probably insured for today’s value, which
is far in excess of their values 25 years
ago. Surely then his increased earning
potential should be likewise insured by
his increasing his life assurance.
To halt or postpone the purchase of
further life assurance because of rising
wages and price rises in commodities is
to ignore history. We have had these
periods before, and during them the sale
of life assurance has increased.
Since 1913 we have had alternating
cycles of high and low prices, or periods
when our pound-notes were “good” or
“bad.” It is absurd to compare our
cycles with, say, the extreme inflation
suffered by Germany after 1914-18.
“G.A.D.” should remember that his
premiums are paid in “good” and “bad”
pounds, and that the proceeds of his
policy will be expended over a period of
high and low prices.
Both Liberal and Labor Governments
have made successive taxation increases
to encourage Australians to buy life
assurance. Further, the Taxation Com-
missioner does not regard the proceeds
of a policy as income, whether by attain-
ing maturity age or by death. (Death
duties are a different matter.)
Australian life offices lead the world in
the liberality of their policy conditions.
If Australians bought more long-term
investments, the safest of which is life
assurance, our present inflationary trend
would be checked.
Our life offices have over 50 per cent,
of their funds invested in Government
and municipal bonds; the balance is
invested in Australian homes and indus-
tries, indicating a faith in the future of
this country which “G.A.D.” and other
pessimists would do well to share.— John
McTioue (N.S.W.).
Fodder-conservation in the N.T.
Of course fodder-conservation is
possible in the Northern Territory (B.
27/2/’52), but under present conditions
there is no incentive for cattlemen there
to go in for it.
If they go to the trouble and expense of
growing fodder to fatten a few choice
"What say we call the picnic off, Arnold, and go to the pictures?”
beasts, they have no prospect of getting
them to market in that condition.
Road trains, carrying only 70-odd-head
1000 miles, are not the answer.
If a railway were built across the
Barkly Tableland to connect the Queens-
land system at Dajarra with the Darwin
line at Birdum, the necessary outlet for
fat cattle would be provided. No
increased cattle production in the “top-
end” of the Territory dan be hoped for
until such a line is built.
Agreed that the beef-cattle business in
the N.T. is in the same state as it was in
1900 ; if anything, the class of cattle has
deteriorated. Cattlemen, especially the
smaller ones, have lost heart. However
good their beasts are, by the time droving
or road-train costs are paid, they can
only hope to market them for a return of
50 per cent, less than the rest of Australia.
If they sell their cattle on the station
they can expect even less —despite high
prices elsewhere. So they take the view
they may as well battle along with a few
scrubbers as waste money improving their
herds and trying to grow fodder. Until
rail-transport is provided it would be a
waste of money.-—C. I. P. (Q.).
Telephone Priorities
The P.M.G. priority system controUing
the connection of telephones is
scrupulously fair (B. 5/3 / ’52). It has
been abused a few times, but detected
instances have been heavily punished.
Cable Records Section, a small,
specialised unit which does not allot
priorities but assumes responsibility for
releasing lines where cable is available
strictly according to priority, runs like
clockwork. Indeed, it would be difficult
to name a more efficient section, or
better-designed machinery governing its
functions, in the entire Commonwealth
services.
On the meagre evidence contained in
“C.T.R.’s” complaint, it appears that his
factory is located in an outlying area
where, as obtains in practically all Sydney
outer-suburban areas, cables are either
hopelessly inadequate or non-existent.
Many such districts covering square miles
of country are still fed by aerial lines
branching from cable-heads containing
no more than 25 pairs. It has been said
that lack of foresight on the part of
P.M.G. engineers caused this serious
shortage; actually, the rapid expansion
of industry (as “C.T.R.” admits happened
in his area) throughout greater metro-
politan Sydney inevitably outpaced
departmental efforts to meet the demand,
“C.T.R.’s” inability to have a phone
installed though several latecomers round
about him were able to do so may
possibly be explained by one or other of
two circumstances: (a) Although
exchange equipment is available in his
locality, cable facilities have not yet
reached his immediate vicinity (even
though such facilities are available on
the opposite side of his street), or (b) his
neighbors were applicants for removal of
telephones, not new applicants, in which
case they would have had prior claim
on spare lines (if any) at the time they
lodged their applications though “C.T.R.”
and others were already established in
the district,
“C.T.R.” seems to have neglected to
put his case (in writing) directly to the
Superintendent of Telephones, a pro-
cedure which would help him if, as he
suggests, he has been subject to unfair
treatment or negligence.
The average person’s animosity to the
telephone priority system is due prin-
cipally to the fact that he does not under-
stand it, and that exchange areas and
cable boundaries do not necessarily
conform to municipal boundaries. Thus
three-parts of any given district may be
plentifully supplied while the remainder
temporarily starves. But priorities remain
the bugbear of the public, and it would
save considerable heartburning if the*
department publicised in simple terms
how and to whom (especially the higher)
priorities are allotted. Postscript
(N.S.W.).
Settlers and Freehold
Soldier-settlers on dry lands in S.A.
can now purchase the freehold of their
blocks after 10 years’ occupation—the
result of persistent representations to the
Federal and the State Governments,
The R.S.L. rightly maintained that
settling on the land was a family job,
and the man should be able to look
forward to handing on his life’s work to
his sons and daughters.
There’s room here for uniformity.
Victoria allows freehold purchase, but in
N. S. Wales and Queensland the land is
perpetual lease. Irrigation lands in S.A.,
however, because of Government stakes
in equipment, etc., must continue to be
leasehold. — Camsa (S.A.).
Weekend Fanners
If “B. A. Ker” (B. 13/2/’52) were to
take a more westerly or nor’-westerly
route from Sydney and keep more to the
byways he’d probably notice a lot of men
and their womenfolk toiling in little
farm-paddocks or orchards at weekends.
If he made a few inquiries he’d find that
quite a number of these toilers were not
local inhabitants careless of the import-
ance of city holidays but “Pitt-street
farmers” putting in their leisure time.
There’s the other sort of “P-5.f.,” who
has his stud somewhere, with well-kept
paddocks dotted with feed-sheds and
enclosed with the neat white-painted
fences and all the other improvements
which a city business magnate can afford
for his hobby. But also there are a
number of us who, although tied to city
jobs, have managed to scratch up the
deposit on from two to 30 untidy acres
within 50 miles of the city.
All the week we plan how far we can
stretch our bank accounts to get the
materials for improvements; then each
weekend we put in about 20 hours’ toil,
ploughing, or grubbing, or doing any
other of the jobs needed to turn another
acre into a productive bit of ground.
This year those of us whose acres have
escaped bushfires haven’t raised much
more than blisters because of the dry
spell, and Mum still has to buy most of
the veges in the city. But we’re still at
it, and no early pioneers were more deter-
mined to wrest a living from the land. —
Brolga (N.S.W.).
Shearing;
In the interest of accuracy here are
some facts from the accounts covering
one very recent shearing in southern
Total shorn, 21,850; shear-
ing team, 20 (including the eight
shearers); time on the shed, five and a
half weeks; total working days, 22;
rates paid, sheep £7 14s. 6d. per hundred,
rams £l5 165., stud sheep £8 19s. 5d,;
daily average per shearer, 118-head:
average daily earnings of shearers,
£9 13s. The cook received £2 Bs. 2d. per
week from each member of the team ;
total £45 15s. 3d. per week. Messing cost
the shearer (in addition to pay of the
cook) £3 2s. lOd. per week. Full cost
of shearing averaged 3s. 7d. per animal.
