An Australasian Anthology
The appearance of An Australasian Anth-
ology from the zealous hands of Percival
Serle raises high hopes. To all readers ol
Australasian verse he is known as the com-
piler of the “Bibliography of Australasian
Poetry and Verse,” which is now in respon-
sible libraries. Such .a bibliography was the
spade-work preliminary to the pleasanter
if more difficult and delicate task of culling
this anthology which he' has now given us,
with the help of two willing collaborators,
Frank YVilmot anil 14. H. Croll. The book
is a specimen of single-minded and unselfish
thoroughness.
In form, it aims at completeness more
than ofher anthologies have done. In
addition to the visual preface stating aims
and acknowledging sources, it has also a
historical introduction to Australian and
Maoriland Poetry, the latter in a separate
section. Necessarily condensed, this intro-
duction disposes of a good many early
verse-writers whose Work had usually little
merit but had been exaggerated in value by
its date. An attempt is made to place these
writers, with Charles Harpur far in the lead.
The more modern writers are left to speak
for themselves.
Whatever caveats may be entered in
discussing this book, it, is by far our best
anthology up till now. The compiler, show-
ing courage no less than care, says that he
has tried not to be influenced by precedent,
and that, “as more than a third of the
poems selected have not previously appeared
in any anthology, the result should give a
new view of Australasian poetry.” It does.
On nearly every page the reader feels a
contact with the elusive thing called poetry.
This means, of course, that the standard
poets have been represented by their better
work. For instance, Hugh McCrac, C. J.
Brennan. Jessie Mackay, Shaw Neilson and
Hubert Church are all respectably treated;
Mary Gilmore and Bernard O’Dowd not, so
well. It, means, again, that the anthology
has been “beautified by its omissions.”
Certain pieces that had been given a foot-
ing in former anthologies as a matter of
habit had already lived too long. Some of
them have been omitted here. The third
cause of success is that many good new
poems are included. Such are the dis-
tinguished poems of the late Lesbia Harford
and of Eileen Duggan. It is remarkable, by
the way, how many of the newer poems in
this book were first published in that, daunt-
less little poetry magazine, Birth, which
ran for seven years from 1916. As for other
new poems in this book, some were not so
recently written but have never before been
chosen for an anthology; of these perhaps
the most memorable are those of William
Baylebridgc. whose early poems were
“crowned” by admission to The Bulletin
Bookshelf about 1912.
With all this, though, the book leaves a
less vivid impression than might be ex-
pected. Has our poetic achievement, after all,
been less striking, individual and native
than was believed? Mr. Serle himself says
that our poetry has proved to be better in
quality than the work of our prose-writers,
a challenging statement which would want
a discussion in itself. Our poetry, as shown
in this book, shows plenty of work that is
cultured enough, but often conventional and
anonymous in style. There is a, certain
lack of variety in outlook and a. sort of
caution as to theme. Perhaps one reason
for this may be found in Mr. Serle’s preface,
where he admits, “There has not been any
attempt to bring together poems that sug-
gest an Australian or New Zealand atmo-
sphere,” and by his obvious pleasure that
“the Australian lyre is no longer strung with
horsehair.” It is true that such verse, satir-
ised in lines quoted by Mr. Serle, was
written in quantities 30 years ago; its
faults, however, lay not in its theme, but
in its lack of intensity. There was nothing
essentially unpoetic in native names or
bush ways or horses; the fault lay in the
journalistic nature of the verse, which
would, of course, be out of place in an
anthology of permanent work.
The question of what to do with ballad
verse and rhetoric, as opposed to intense
lyrical work, must always arise when an
anthology is being prepared. Mr. Serle
has on the whole answered the question by
sheer omission ; this has meant, for instance,
the exclusion of A. B. Paterson. C. J.
Dennis, Essex Evans and John Farrell.
But here comes in the notorious danger of
throwing the baby out with the bath. For
instance, is it not mere prejudice against
their subject matter that has caused Mr.
Serle to exclude everything by T. W. Heney
and Barcroft Boake? I would suggest that
Barcroft Boake is a serious and significant
loss. His poem, “Where the Dead Men
Lie,” is not a straggling ballad; it has the
cadence .and poignancy of a complete lyric
and far more intensity than some of the
library poems of abstract sentiment which
are included. To dread crudeness in our
poetry is often to dread the sap of life in it.
Granting, though, that Mr. Serle has a
certain predisposition • towards poetry that
is rather quietist than daring, then his
choice from page to page comes off glori-
ously. When it is remembered what an
enormous mass of verse appears in Australia
and that Mr. Serle has drawn not only on
published volumes but on journals and
manuscripts, his faithful research appears
immense. And in his care for sheer poetry
he has discovered much that is genuinely
creative. He has found a poet expressing
something that before was elusive (as Elsie
Cole in her astonishing “Anemone”) or
again one who uses a common phrase and
shows the core of poetry in it (as Marie
Pitt does in the first line of “Doherty’s
Corner”), and this has meant so much
ground gained for poetry. Again, 11. M.
Green, inventing a Sapphic-Alcaic stanza of
his own, works up the fragrance and magic
of an orange district into a poem that
would be almost liypnptic but for the keen-
ness of its passion. So the book is rich.
Technically, it is finely printed, produced,
arranged and proof-read and for this the
old British publishing firm of Collins must
have some of the credit. The index of
authors ami select bibliography is valuable,
though one asks why writers’ jobs are stated
in some cases and not in others, why their
dates are sometimes given and sometimes
withheld, and why it is sometimes the writ-
ing name and sometimes the business name
that is put between brackets. The compact
list, though, certainly does make the book
useful for reference. Lastly, the unusually
modest, title, coming after Golden Trea-
suries and Oxford Books, lets An Austral-
asian Anthology open the door for suc-
cessors which will be unlikely to challenge
its high efficiency until sheer effluxion of
time makes that necessary.
NETTIE PALMER.
The Plays of Noel Coward
Sines the lessening in the creative glow
in Galsworthy and Shaw and the definite
retirement some while since of Will Shak-
speare of the Globe, the position of British
drama has become somewhat nervous. Any-
how, the alarm bells have been rung and
the Agates, the Greins and the other London
dramatic critics have been out, noses down
and ears acock, the bloodhounds of their
percipiencc baying, seeking such a White
Hope of deftness, glamor and British taut-
ness of purpose as will again plant the
.combined crosses of St, George, St. Andrew
and St. Patrick at least two terraces higher
than the puny banner of the Schnitzlers and
Pirandellos.
The enterprise has not gone amiss. May-
be there have been some false scents, and
what had sometimes every appearance of
a quarry had, after a concentrated tally-ho,
a scamper over low country and a duly
postered kill, turned out to be a mere Lons-
dale or a Maugham; but, praise be to
Heaven! that is all over now. The hunts-
men must receive the thanks of the nation,
for they have run down a fellow who has
all the subtle knowledge of Mayfair which
Michael Allen refused to conceal in his
native Armenian, who has also all the neces-
sary spirit'uosity, sweetness and insight, and
whose glissandos up and down the delicate
surfaces of thought and humor have all the
marks of real genius. His name? He is
called Noel Coward. And the manner of
this being? Let me seek to indicate his
raptness and sureness of touch and show
you a Valentino of. the spoken word by
bringing together again for a minute in the
Coward manner Armand and Camille in
that old rustle among the crinolines, “La
Dame Aux Camellias.” As Coward would
say:—
(Camille is lying on a beautiful couch of the
Third Empire, beautifully smoking' one of those
beautiful cigarettes only made in beautifully small
quantities for the Comte Ulric de Grandsoif in the
Rue d’Enf'er, Paris. Armand enters asl she is
languidly turning over the pag'es of Marcel Proust’s
“Du Cote de Chen Swann”)
Camille: It is.so difficult to be difficult when one
has a perfect nature,
Armand : I have separated my passion from my
love for you and have found them both divine.
Camille : -So sweet! l)id you bring me some
chocolates ? There is only one firm that makes them
—the Contr.'ipunto Fratelli in ltome.
Armand: No.
Camille: Silly boy.
Armand: I adore you.
Camille: What agony.
Armand: You do not care?
Camille: Au fond, you are saucy.
Armand : No.
Camille: What then?
Armand: Distracted.
Camille: Deserved.
After about 479 of such exchanges, most
of them staccato to the point of monosylla-
banality, but, still enabling Camille to dis-
port her fancy among the costumieres of
Paris, Berlin, Stamboul and the Solomon
Islands, and permitting her to give a gallop
to Coward's memories of the Lido, the Par-
fum d’Azur worn by the Grafin von
Schmerzmund, the bath salts perfected by
Aldous Huxley, the frijoles fancied by
Alphonso XIII., not to mention the Matter-
horn at sunrise and the signs of the zodiac,
Armand, now getting into a state that
would explode any clinical applied under
his tongue, discovers the fact patent to the
first-drummer in the orchestra that the pur-
pose of the drama is to make Cowards of
them all, and that all he has to do is to
hustle down the curtain by picking up
Camille’s favorite finger-bowl and smash-
ing it to the floor.
When Ihe news is bruited abroad that
Mr. Coward’s eyes are turning- in with con-
centration. his manner portending another
play of staggering dramatic worth, the
Sevres porcelain factory puts on another
1000 hands and the Italian statuette indus-
try, previously feeling times hard, declares a

festa and a rise in wages. And for why?
Coward is their greatest customer. A new
effort by him is overtime to them. He is
the most prolific demolisher oi brittle
articles on any stage. Of all the bulls in
china-shops he easily commits the most.
His confections are elaborate arrangements
of Venuses de Milo in plaster-of-pans,
cake-dishes, flower-bowls, epergnes and what
not all handy to the reach of some\sheik
who full of Sauterne or love, of the vintage
43 b.c., and crammed with culture, Oxford
Union, 1918, lusts for some direct action
after tedium on tedium of indirect thought.
I respectfully refer you to Nicky of Mr.
Coward’s “The Vortex,” who, at the apex
of the same horror that afflicted the young
persoii of Somerset Maugham’s “Our
Betters,” dispels any doubt as to his anguish
by sweeping off with a crash all the pietties
from his sinful mother’s dressing-table. I
cite further Larita of “Easy Virtue, who
knocks over the statuette; Raoul of T. he
Marquise,” who is a perfect Attila among
glass goods; and Nadya of “The Queen Was
in the Parlor,” who discovers that the sum-
mit of repartee is to bring down with a hand
flip another piece of crystal. Even in “Hay
Fever,” a comparatively light intermezzo,
the young and ingenious author lias to floor
a barometer for the full count ot ten.
If I have dealt somewhat lengthily with
Mr. Coward, I have been merely aiming to
exhibit the state of British drama and the
state of British criticism. To me, Mr.
Coward has only a very passable talent for
machine-gun effects, sometimes adeptly con-
trived to produce a popular producer’s
counterfeit of tenseness and strain; but
against this credit must be debited certain
seedy partialities not hitherto recorded, to
wit, the partiality for tired themes (only
in “Fallen Angels” does he endeavor to
break any new ground), the bias for heady
coincidental occurrences, the stealthy regard
for Cecil Raleighisms (consider this Exhibit
A by Eloise in “The Marquise”: “Drive me
out of your house alone —bereft of my
child—bereft of your protection”), and the
no less slinking affection, developed to an
amour by A. A. Milne, for having a char-
acter who has heard a conversation started
on. say, the economic structure of the
Empire, chip in irrelevantly with a juicy
allusion to the poetry there is in keeping
white mice when one is in the right mood.
There is little more to say. In the true
artist the finest flights are spontaneous,
varied and irrepressible. In Noel Coward
they are generally the rabid expressions of
a major mimic sense. Not without some
worth of achievement in theatrical tricks,
he is still eternally sawing at the one tune
—a sort of boudoir Tschaikowsky in a glass-
cracker suite.
C. R. BRADISH.
Who is Melba’s Successor?
Dr. Keith Barry’s discussion of “Who is
Melba’s Successor?” (R.P. 16/6/’27) has been
read with much interest and widely can-
vassed amongst Australian artists in Lon-
don.
There seems to be general agreement that
several first-raters have not been mentioned
(to name only one, Harold Williams, who
is as fine a baritone and musician as can
be found in England to-day), and that
several second-raters have been included.
Florence Austral is, as far as one can judge,
almost unanimously considered to stand, as
Dr. Barry has suggested, “head and shoul-
ders above any musician Australia has sent
across the waters” in recent years. Many,
indeed, consider that she has been for the
last three years a greater singer-actress
than Melba ever was, and this opinion is
shared by many English artists and critics.
All admit that, though in the Red Page
list there are many excellent artists, she is
the only one who is absolutely exceptional
and great.
Some disagreement is expressed with the
last paragraph of the article. There are
many much-boomed teachers of voice pro-
duction and singing in England and on the
Continent who are not to be recommended:
and there are some well advertised, w r ell
recommended, expensive and over-worked
ones who are sheer quacks. If any are to
be imported into Australia, then the utmost
care should be taken in the selection, and
the only recommendation to be considered
should be the great artists whom they have
turned out. Many an Australian singer has
had his (or her) voice ruined on this side;
he could have done far better at home.
There is a lack of really first-class teachers
not only in Sydney, but in every country,
and if a top-notcher is to be got for Aus-
tralia, then he must be sought anywhere
in the world and must be paid his price.
Probably those who would have to pay it
would faint if they heard what such men
earn.
LONDON.

Art in Australia
Beatrice Tildesley, in an article on the
artist’s vision (R.P. 8/9/’27) makes one or
two remarkable statements in an effort to
prove that “no picture can be really great
unless it possesses over the strength and
solidity of its drawing the softness as of
a bloom.” Certainly many of the Old
Masters had softness, ,and the old academic
school of painting in England prior to the
twenties cultivated that quality. Yet it
would be difficult to deny the greatness of
certain paintings by Sir William Orpen,
William Nicholson, George Lambert—self
portraits and the like. which can scarcely be
said to bloom; and the water-colors of
Munnings, brilliantly hard and brilliantly
clever.
Good draughtsmanship seldom these days
is allied to softness. Phil May is evidence
of greatness with most uncompromising
hardness and economy of line.
Miss Tildesley mentions “the devastating
ugliness created by power-driven industry.”
Industry is rarely ugly. The Brangwyn in-
dustrial etchings dealing with railways and
ship-construction are among the master-
pieces of the century. To come nearer
home, one of the finest pictures exhibited
this year in Sydney was Percy Lindsay’s
painting of the North Shore bridge in a
state of construction.
Miss Tildesley’s statement that “Cubists,
post-impressionists and the rest are little
more than names to us,” was made, of
course, before the opening of the Society
of Artists’ Exhibition.

Whether he suffers from indigestion or a
grouch against the world the reader must
decide.

Thwing (Macmillan). A collection of
studies of college men associated with the
principal universities of the U.S.A., together

American section of the book, much the

The Flying Kestrel, by Captain Dingle

literary craft has been a master in sail and
steam, and can pitch a sea-yarn with a vigor
that years have not abated. When the Old
Man on a Yankee sailing-ship dealt in dis-
cipline, he brought to the task a flow of lan-
guage and a brutality that squelched all
argument. Yet in reading this book one is
caught uj) in the spirit of pride when, in the
last days of her race, the Kestrel flirted the
sprays about her head and, trampling down
the broken seas at her quarters, went lean-

Recollections of the Irish War, by Dar-
rell Figgis (BennL These personal impres-
sions cover that period in the long conflict
for Irish independence which dates from the
establishment of the Irish Volunteers in the
autumn of 1913 to the truce in July, 1921,
which led to the establishment of the present
Free State Government. The events of the
Easter rising in 1916 and the condition of
Ireland in the closing days of the war are
graphically described.
Judicial Dramas, by Horace Wyndham
(Fisher Unwin). The historical divorce
case involving the reputation of Queen Caro-
line heads the list. There are also the theft
of the Crown jewels by Colonel Blood, the
trial and execution of Governor Wall, the
matrimonial troubles of the Ladies Elleu-
borough and Honyman, the naughtiness of
the Countess of Elgin and a young Scots-
man who let himself in for £lO,OOO damages,
and much other diverting and scandalous
matter.
Egypt, by George Young (Benn). “The
Modern World” series to which this volume
is a contribution contemplates a general
survey of the historical forces which have
gone to make up the political, social and
economic world of to-day. As to Egypt, the
author expresses the optimistic opinion that
“resolution of the difficulties that still remain
only requires that there should be Govern-
ments on either side capable of expressing
the mutual generosity and goodwill of two
peaceable peoples.”
Giants in the Earth, by O. E. Rolvaag
(Ernest Benn). This saga of the prairie has
been translated from the Norwegian; its
Norse author lived for 30 years in the U.S.A.
It may be described as a psychological
tragedy seen through the eyes of one born in
the gloom and severity of a small island
just south of where the Arctic Circle cuts
the coast of Norway. In the story Per
Plansa emigrates to the States, and with
his family moves across into Dakota terri-
tory. Sundered from her kin Beret, his
wife, finds a horror to which she cannot
reconcile herself, and it is the conflict be-
tween temperamental attitudes to the fight
against hostile natural forces that constitutes
the dramatic significance of a powerful
novel.
iSeven Days with God , by A. M. Rihbany
(Allen and Unwin). The author sees in
modern Western life a danger in the
detachment of so many of its outer activi-
ties from its inner spiritual centre. This
tendency towards materialism will increase
in power unless a balance is maintained
between the two forces of the inward and the
outward man. “If,” he says, “the West
needs, as I think it does, to emulate the
Hast in completely subordinating material
to spiritual interests, the religion it now
possesses is amply sufficient to lead it in
that glorious way.”
The Glad School, by Constance Mackness
(Cornstalk Publishing Co.). “A story of
those girls who are really the backbone of
the Glad School, the girls who work faith-
fully and well, and whose youthful high
spirits are always restrained by a sobering
sense of responsibility and duty, would con-
tain too much of work to afford recreation,”
the author remarks as she proceeds to por-
tray the more entertaining figures of the
madcap and the scapegrace. What’s true of
life outside is equally true of life in the
Glad School. Madcaps and scapegraces in
and out of school may, as the author wisely
comments, be very lovable folk. This liter-
ary linctus is quite “good for girls,” and is
manufactured in Australia.
Bismarck, Andrassy and their Successors,
by Count Julius Andrassy (Benn). The
writer is the son of the Andrassy who was
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Austro-Hun-
gary in 1871-79. The author stresses the
changed attitude of Bismarck after he had
secured his aim of uniting Germany under
Prussian hegemony. Thereafter his sole
object was to retain and, if possible,
strengthen by peaceful means what he had
won in war.' With the old Chancellor’s dis-
missal by the self-opiniated and arrogant
young emperor, the pillar which had for so
many years upheld the edifice of peace in
Europe fell, broken, to the ground. A very
interesting book, and, having regard to
national bias on the part of the writer,
not deliberately unjust to the recent enemies
of his country.
,4n Introduction to the Study of Blake, by
Max Plowman (Dent). William Blake,
mystic, poet, symbolist, prophet and artist,
holds a unique position. Some with brutal
frankness have dubbed him a madman, others
have acclaimed him as a seer with a vision
of Heaven. “Blake,” says the author, “can-
not be classed. He was the most indepen-
dent artist that ever lived. He had liis own
sources of inspiration (so peculiar and
strange that no one else has dared to drink
from them), his own strange technique, his
own method of printing, his own method of
illustrating and his own secret way of repro-
ducing his illustrations.” The attempt to
draw some plain meaning from the con-
fusion of symbolism in which he wraps his
message ends in defeat: Mr. Plowman warns
his readers not to be misled into thinking
that mere intellectual effort will suffice to
bring them to an appreciation of Blake.
Many folks prejudiced in favor of clear
thinking and plain speaking may question
whether the struggle is worth while.
How to Make More Net Profit, by Herbert
N. Casson (Cornstalk Publishing Co.;. An
Australian edition of a book by the editor
of the English Efficiency Magazine The
title appeals to everyone—for who does not
want to make more money V —and though pri-
marily intended for business folk it contains
much that may profit the man outside. The
author is sarcastic about the use of the
words “gross profit.” “It means nothing,” lie
remarks. “You might as well say ‘a vic-
torious failure’ ‘Gross profit’ is a phrase
that was invented by accountants to hide the
inefficiency of managing directors. It is an
excuse. It is an attempt to make things look
better than they are. It is an effort to
whitewash a black situation.” From this
extract it may be surmised correctly that the
author writes briskly and expresses himself
frankly.
“B.B.” : Re Clifford W. Collinson’s “Life
and Laughter ’Midst the (Cannibals.” Last
English mail brought me a note from the
author explaining that he didn’t prig his
illustrations from Burns-Philp postcards —
lie sold B.P. his negatives with the right 10
reproduce them. Collinson, by the way, is
doing well in England, lecturing and broad-
casting blood-curdling “cannibal” yarns, and
is working on another book in between times.
His house near Hendon aerodrome he has
called Simbo, after the island in the
Solomons where he ran a trading station.
“S.T.S.”: The League of Nations issues
each year a list of notable books produced
in each country. England’s list of 40 for
1926 contains nothing in the realm of drama
and only three works of fiction. These are
Galsworthy’s “Silver Spoon,” Buchan’s very
ordinary “Dancing Floor” (which seems to
me a mere hotchpotch of Anthony Hope and
Algernon Blackwood), and John Erskine s
“Helen of Troy.” Erskine is making a great
name by taking the famous romances and
satirically standing them on their head, so
to speak. The Galahad-and-Lancelot legend
is his latest victim.
“Wanchai”: Stevenson’s description in
“The Dynamiter” of the death of the Fair
Cuban’s father was an accurate forecast or
his own. The resemblance of the following
passages is uncanny. Thus the author, in
the text of his tale: —
“How is this?” lie cried.... Then suddenly he
raised both hands to his temples, cried out, “My
head, my head!” and reeled and fell
And Graham Balfour, in his “Life of
8.L.5.” :
Suddenly he put both hands to his head, and
cried out, “What’s that?” Then he asked quickly,
“Do 1 look strange?” Even as he did so, he fell
cn his knees....
It is a coincidence, too, that in each case
the first of fiction and the second of fact -
a woman was the grief-stricken witness of
the passing.

Grey Magpies.
The west wind roars in the gum-tree tops
And the grey bell magpies ride
lo and fro as the branches go
Sweeping from side to side.
The magpies sing in the wind-tossed boughs
And their clear primordial notes
Rise and rise to the racing skies
I rom the slender grey-clad throats.
They tell of days when the world was new,
I hey carol their age-long pain,
Chant their fight ’gainst the furious might
Dt hunger, gales and rain.
And then they sing of the age-long joys,
W bile the trees with vitals torn
Crack and crash as they feel the lash
Of the wind's wild wrath and scorn.
B'it the grey bell magpies know no fear
Of their ancient enemy;
Proud they swing with the wind and sing
In fierce triumphal glee.

The Painted Clipper.
She ruffles down a glimmering sea
All jade; and pale as ivory
The waves curl into foam, and high
Behind her clouds soar up the sky.
She is the only surging thing
In this prim room where glittering
One shaft of sunlight falls by me
Where I sit drinking China tea.
Oh, lovely prisoned ship! The gold
And narrow frame can never hold
Her captive now, for all my dreams
Go with her down a way that gleams.
And dimly I hear someone say:
“My dear, she did it in this way—
Four tiny tucas ’. .. .but I again
Am mooring in an opal rain ;
Beside a yellow Eastern town,
A yellow river rolling down
Bears countless craft, and to and fro
In strange streets yellow people go.
Oh, I can hear an endless song—
The silky wash of waves along
Her sides, as we make sail and ride
Again out with the yellow tide.
But rollicking sea-chanties die
Again beneath a painted sky.
The lovely clipper crowding sail
Hangs merely from a picture rail.
And someone tells me the bride’s dress
Was silver all—they do not guess
That I have been this golden day
Where winds swept out from old Cathay.

Lane Cove River.
Save when, now and then, a ferry
Sets the water’s face a-quiver,
Softly slumbers spring’s pale moonlight
On the broad and placid river.
Circling mossy pile and beacon,
Washing green-walled lawn and arbor,
Voicing little liquid whispers,
Comes a tide from sea and Harbor.
Here and there, a mullet wakened
By the clean tide inward creeping,
Flashes back the moonlight’s splendor,
From the under-waters leaping.
Leaving rock and flat, it succors
Many mouths, and journeys lifting
Stranded w T eeds that wait its coming,
Flotsam oh its bosom drifting.
While the full moon on the river
Wondrous beauty spills and squanders,
Life renewing, health bequeathing,
Over shoal and beach it wanders.
Adding sweetness unto sweetness.
Music through the night goes winging—
Now it is a sound of voices,
Now a violin is singing.
Notes that set the air a-ripple,
Set its pulseless calm a-quiver;
Born of sadness, born of gladness,
Drift across the shining river.
Folk ashore and folk on ferry
From this banquet, lit and splendid,
From this feast of light and music,
Shall hie home by joy attended.
Guests in Eden for a little,
They shall keep and treasure ever
Song vouchsafed and beauty captured
From the night-hour on the river.

Recollection.
I heard a lark by Melbourne town
And all the years came tumbling down ;
I was again a little boy
Roaming with eyes that sang with joy
In English meadows, all aglow
With cowslip gold and daisy snow.
And hard by Melbourne town I heard
The trill and rapture of a bird—
Amid the clang of tram and train
And the soft fall of winter rain :
Oh, it was good to find the key
Qf all the years come back to me.

The Singing Bird.
To-day the bird has changed his song,
The unseen bird that on the hill
Sings all the golden morning long
With open throat and saffron bill.
I know not what ethereal call
Lie hears from out the stooping wood,
What magic of far clouds in thrall
To summer airs in frolic mood.
But softly from the midmost green,
Drop by clear drop, his notes distil
A music like the yellow sheen
r Upon the opening daffodil.
There is no lingering sadness felt,
As in his song of yesterday;
His plaintive opening seems to melt
Into a merry roundelay.
Is it but mirth because his nest
Is lined within and rounded well,
Or did his grey mate’s downy breast
Feel the first breaking of the shell?
Or does he hear the happy rain—
A stranger long to these brown ways—
Come warmly from the North again
To sweeten all the greener days?
I cannot toll; but I can feel
The joy he sings about me spill.
I know the magic that can heal
The hidden sorrow of the hill.
For, where, a long dark shadow lay,
. There sleeps a beauty without stain.
These sweet pale lips have smiled to-day—
A little maid grows well again.

Duty.
The hawthorn-trees along my fence
Lean out in peering rows,
As if they fain would see the way
The winding roadway goes ;
And I, in patient wistfulness,
Stand watching at the gate;
We are akin, the trees and I,
We can but stand and wait.
I follow with my hungry eyes
The furze-companioned lane,
To where it slopes toward the creek,
And then goes on again,
Till, turning at a quiet place
Of shade and dappled light,
It dallies there a little space
Before it slips from sight,
As if it sensed my loneliness,
And fain would wait for me,
Before it clambered to the sky
And then dipped to the sea.
I like to think it rambles on
Past tussock, ridge and dune,
And idles in a carefree way
Right through the afternoon.
Briar and gorse and starry fields,
A robin red, perchance,
Are potent with a witchery
For joyous dalliance.
Perhaps it passes valleys green
Like shining bowls of jade,
Within whose curvant loveliness
Are golden bands, inlaid,
Where wheaten ears, all mellow-ripe,
In rustling wealth proclaim
The richness of the treasury
From which their fulness came.
And when the softened contours make
A fairy world at dusk,
And fragrant comes upon the wind
The drowsy scent of musk,
Its song of dreamy restfulness,
I know, grows rapt and sweet,
As. like a sleepy elf, it walks
.With soft, moon-silvered feet—■
While I, between my hawthorn-trees,
Stand, wistful, at the gate,
The road may go adventuring.
But we must stand and wait.

LUCY HILL.
Kathleen.
The hill sloped up, bound on its clear-cut
rim
By the blue Queensland sky, seen softly
through
Soft-swaying she-oak boughs, ragged and
slim.
She stood in beauty where the grass-tree
spears
Dripped honey from their creamy blossom-
ing heads
Adown the grey-green shafts, like amber
tears.
Her muslin frock held high, puckered to hold
Some treasure. Nona so dear as those grey
eyes
And dusky lashes with their glints of gold.
The rosy childish fingers shook with all
Of joy and wonder. With a rapturous air
She let the gathered muslin slowly fall.
And —butterflies! A cloud of moving white
Winged round her upraised head. She
stood entranced,
A blessM vision for my heart's delight.
Love, till they close for evermore, my eyes,
Blind to the passing show, will watch you
there
Among the grass trees—and the butterflies.

Stcadilu Winning the Dai|
JL'
AUSTRALIA has one deadly enemy—an enemy
who fights from within. For years this destroy-
ing force has been at work, seizing at the wheels of
Australia’s industries, whispering disloyal thoughts
in the ears of Australia’s populace. The name of this
enemy is PREJUDICE!
The fact that our national industries have forged
ahead in spite of this sinister influence is due to the
-Very thing that Prejudice decries —the quality or
Australian Products.
The success of Old Court Wlhisky is an instance. In
the early stages of its marketing its fight with
Prejudice was severe. Gradually, quality and purity
are winning the day. The demand for Old Court
Whisky grows stronger; the influence of Prejudice
grows weaker. But it is the duty of every good Aus-
tralian to stamp this evil out —completely
FINALLY.
The next time Prejudice tempts you to order imported
whisky remember this:
Six months ago we offered to donate
£lOOO to Charity if it could be proved
that Old Court Whisky was not the
purest sold in Australia —that chal-
lenge has never been taken up.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1927.
THE GREAT SLANG-WHANG
ELECTION.
New South Wales has a. chance this week
to get rid of the most utterly disgraceful
Government in its history, and if the oppor-
tunity is missed it may not occur again for
a very long time. For if the Slang-Whang
crowd returns with a majority—the new red
Lang - Gosling - Horsington crowd which
jumped the claim of the caucus-elected
Ministry—and manages to control the
Second Chamber the will of the people will
count for little during a lot of years. With
judicious stuffing and the like the majority
candidates are likely to have the same hope
as most of the anti-LANG Labor members
had at the recent selection voting. This
isn’t the kind of collection which has a
prospect of holding its billets and salaries
by honest means, and it isn’t the kind of
collection which looks likely to sacrifice its
billets and salaries on the altar of integrity.
* * * *
The Ministry has many records, financial
and otherwise. Under its management Syd-
ney, by the latest Federal Quarterly Stat-
istics, is the most expensive capital to live
in, and the most expensive town out of 30
—five in each State. In the first quarter of
1927 N.S.W. achieved the distinction,
according to the same authority, of having
the largest percentage of unemployed. This
is ascribed in a measure to the fact
that the Treasurer seized on some
half-million of the Road Board funds
and used them to make his own
finances look a little more decent. This
naturally meant that a great number of
road-workers had to be refused employment
or lost the employment they had. It also
led to worse roads, which will be worse still
later on, and the State’s roads have no
superfluous excellence to spare. What road-
work remained in the country was to a con-
siderable extent monopolised (or, at least,
the pay was) through the sending of city
unemployed to live in camps, where it
appeared that one or two or three hundred
ballots might turn the scale in favor of the
Slang-Whang nominee, for the month
which would qualify them as voters. And
in addition to the common or garden variety
of out-of-workness the loss of employment
through what is politely labelled “industrial
disturbance” (some of it was very disturb-
ing) was remarkable under the latest and
most violent Labor regime. In 1926 N.S.W.
lost 1,111,230 days’ employment and
£1,229,410 of wages through strikes, while
all the other States and Territories com-
bined sacrificed only 199,031 days and
£186.406 in wages.
$ * * *
A matter which helped the present crowd
into office in 1925 was the promise of
widows’ pensions. It promptly raised sal-
aries all round (the Premier bagged another
£445 a year for himself), and it solidified its
position by bribing Independent member
Ivay out of his seat with a highly-paid billet
and nominating a Laborite in his place; but
there was no such liberality about the pen-
sions. In fact they proved mostly a poor
delusion. A widow with a dependent child
was provided with a small allowance for both;
the allowance ceased, however, when the
child reached the age of 14, on the principle
that the bereaved woman was old enough
by that time to do for herself. For the
widow as a widow pure and simple no pro-
vision was made. The Ministry enacted a
childhood endowment scheme just in time
for the 1927 election, but it didn’t provide the
money. It merely ordered the aggregate
employer to find it by contributing a sum
equal to 3 per cent, of his wages bill, so
that the manufacturer or the mining com-
pany, and especially the liberal one, will pay
much, and the importer whose goods are
made abroad will pay little, and the estate-
agent, bookmaker, lawyer, money-lender,
union-secretary and other unproductives
will contribute practically nothing. The
endowment fund is still an infant and
already shows signs of being an insolvent
one. It is reckoned that a tax of 4i per
cent, on the employer’s (especially the good
employer’s) wage-bill will be necessary to
provide enough money for the present
endowments, or else to put so many
employers out of action that there will be
less money than there is now. The Premier
has wildly promised to increase every child’s
allowance, if he gets back, and to extend the
scheme to scores of thousands not now in-
cluded; and one of his imported colleagues
has asked how there can be any difficulty
seeing that Australia (the whole of it) sub-
scribed £400,000,000 for “fireworks in Europe.”
But Australia never subscribed that amount
for fireworks, and the loan idea is an impos-
sible vision. Excessively costly workmen’s
insurance, increased wages, child endowment
and reduced hours (the week underground is
now 30 hours long) have already contri-
buted to the stoppage of two large Broken
Hill mines. Metal prices are certainly low,
but they have been as low, or lower, before
without producing absolute disaster.
* * * *
Rural industry, in addition to suffering
from all the general troubles, has been
struck by the new basic wage which an excit-
able Commissioner fixed in such haste that,
he didn’t wait to hear evidence, though he
had 11 available weeks before him. He
didn’t wait, either, to hear that there was a
serious drought over a considerable part of
the State to aggravate the inopportuneness
of hasty pre-election innovations. The rural
position is made worse by the fact that the
railways were lately compelled to put up
charges (Premier Slang promised that
charges would be reduced) and will be
forced to raise them again. With a £450,000
deficit for the year, due partly to increased
pay and privileges and mostly to the 44-
hour week, and another £680,000 per annum
to be found for child endowment, the rail-
way position is so bad that very serious
trouble looms ahead. So grinding economy
is the order of the day, and the country
towns begin to fill with unemployed. Yet
the Slang Government has had almost
unlimited money to spend—more than it is
ever likely to have again—biff its unlimited
incompetence makes money of little use to it,
For the financial year 1926-27 it somehow
got through £19,236,674 of loan money, bor-
rowed in three countries. That was N.S.W.’s
record loan expenditure, and also Australia’s.
The second worst record for the State and
for Australia was when Treasurer Slang
spent £14.701,028 of borrowed money in
1920-21. The third worst for the State was
when the same individual spent, £11.180,482
of lOU funds in 1925-26. The fourth worst
was when the same incredible spendthrift
blewed £10,442,732 of the same kind of
money in 1921-22.
* * * *
The Government, or its head, grossly de-
ceived the Governor when it got a batch of
friends into the grossly inflated Upper House
with the assurance that their votes were not
wanted to procure the abolition of that
body. It grossly deceived the people when
it pledged itself in Parliament last Novem-
ber to go to the country in March. It has
worked up a remarkable reputation in the
way of finding billets for its friends, includ-
ing billets as returning-officers to count the
vote at the coming election. Friends like-
wise count the ballot-papers in the kero-
sene-tin at the rowdy Labor selection
meeting. The Slang Ministry has proved
a good ally of the gambling and drink
interests, and its party runs the most dis-
reputable administration on record at
Sydney Town Haul. A steady refusal of
any inquiry into the scandals has made it
very serviceable, but hasn’t made the Town
Haul any more solvent. The Slang-Whang
is an incompetent and bullying combination
whose habit of shutting down on Parlia-
mentary criticism led to fiascoes such as
the Newspaper Tax law and the Electoral
Act. Its botching of the Fair Rents law in
1926 is estimated to have so aggravated the
position that Sydney is 30,000 houses short.
The Premier joined the Red Revolutionary
element and grasped at its offer of a dic-
tatorship. He contrived, by taking advant-
age of an accommodating and inexperienced
Excellency, to get rid of the Labor Ministry
which the caucus had created according to
the rules of the game, and created another
selected by himself. It has never once met
Parliament, for the best of all possible
reasons, and doesn’t intend to, which gives
it a place of its own among Ministries. And
the question always arises whether the Pre-
mier is a worker at all and properly eligible
for union membership, or only an auc-
tioneer and estate-agent.
THE FEDERAL CASHIER’S STORY.
The Federal Budget has been received in
many quarters with applause, though there
is difficulty in guessing why, for in most
respects it is a darned unsatisfactory publi-
cation. The Treasurer had a surplus of
£2,635,597, and, adding money on hand at
the beginning of the y r ear, it rose to nearly
three millions. But as he proceeded to
allocate £2,921,494 for a number of purposes
(including £2,000,000 for naval construction)
which were presumably legitimate and
necessary, it is difficult to feel sure that
he had a surplus at all. An increase of
£1,642,100 in Customs receipts was due to
the fact that imports were £20,000,000 more
than the exports could pay for, and (adding
the £30,000,000 of surplus exports that are
required to cover interest, etc.), £50,000,000
more than the country could pay for with
its own means. So the Commonwealth
added at least £50,000,000 to its gold lia-
bilities abroad, and the Treasurer got as
a result £1,642,100 more paper income at
home. In these circumstances it is proposed
to make a material reduction in the land-
tax, which doesn’t matter much, and in the
income-tax, which matters a great deal. In
other words, the Commonwealth is to rely
less on revenue, which is fairly dependable,
and consequently more on Customs, which
might be defined as partly a disease and
partly a quicksand.
Another reason why the surplus
of £2,635,597 wears an air of unreality
is that the Commonwealth added £2,624,391
to its debt. In other words, it paid off
some war burden as usual, about which a
great song was made, and, as usual, in-
curred more peace burden to make up. For
1927-28 it is proposed to have a surplus of
about £48,000, though it may be four
millions of paper surplus if the States and
the Commonwealth borrow abroad much
more than they did last year, or four mil-
lions of deficit if they have to do with
much less. The Federal loan expenditure
for 1927-28 is set down at £14,750,000, and
in such conditions a surplus of £48,000 is
hardly worth while. All these festive doings
are apart from the liability which the Com-
monwealth incurs by backing State bills,
and that is both huge and indefinite.
« * * *
For a Government which proposes to sac-
rifice nearly £1,800,000 of its fairly depend-
able income some of the proposals appear
wild enough. Two millions of TOU money
are wanted for the Federal capital, and 3f
millions to lend to the States to help the
acquisition of the elusive migrant.
Nothing is said about any vigorous effort
to make the Commonwealth’s own N. Ter-
ritory (523,620 square miles, of which 99f
per cent, is public property) ready for
migrants. Among other big things that are
proposed are the usual grants for roads, but
not in the Territory, and a policy of
advancing Savings Bank deposits and loan
money, up to £20,000,000, to build homes.
The advances are to be as much as 90 per-
cent. of the boom value which the greatest
borrowing boom on record has created, and
if the 20 millions’ worth of security
only shrinks to 10 millions when the day of
Hard Reality arrives the Government of
the day will have been born under a lucky
star. Amid all this racket and orgy and
riot and frenzy it is a pity that the Gov-
ernment didn’t hang on to all its existing
revenues, and at least refrain from putting
■mother mortgage on poor Canberra. It is
pawned enough already. It was mentioned
in passing that the Commonwealth’s share
of the State losses will
exceed 10 millions, which is another luck-
less “home”-making investment in a bad
way.
* * * *
With it all there was a lack of any
allusion to the circumstance that Australia
hangs by a hair over a precipice the bottom
of which isn’t visible. The position is that
unless it can reduce imports or increase
exports by between 50 and 60 million
pounds per annum, or combine the opera-
tions, serious trouble is inevitable, and bil-
lions of paper surplus won’t help. Even
if Treasurer Page has no immediate remedy
in view, and one is hard to find, it would
be some satisfaction if he mentioned that
one is needed and that he is looking round
for it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Comrade” at Work.
In a characteristically entertaining oration
at Lakemba (N.S.W.) the other night, Mr.
Lang’s eminent colleague Baddeley declared
that there was no Communism in Aus-
tralia—that was just a Nationalist election
lie. But lest anyone should conclude from
this statement that he wasn’t a class-
conscious comrade, the Minister for Mines
went on to say that he didn’t mind being
called a Bolshevik or a Communist, and
described himself as one of the “Red men’’
of N. S. Wales. Having thus made his atti-
tude on the subject as clear as mud, he
drifted on to other topics.
McCormack, of Queensland, who ought
to know as much about the inside workings
of the Labor party as Baddeley does, spoke
a piece in his Parliament the following day
and gave reasons for his belief that there
not only is Communism in Australia, but a
great deal too much of it. He told about
a corps of Communists, sixty strong, that
rushed over the border from Sydney to
Brisbane to brighten up the railway strike,
of another little gj’oup that helped to make
the game willing in South Johnstone, and
of still other little groups that popped up
inside everj r union whenever an industrial
dispute gave an opportunity for raising a
rumpus. There are very few people in the
Labor movement who haven’t got the best
of reasons for knowing that McCormack
was right and that Baddeley spoke with his
tongue in his cheek. In every Australian
city there are “comrades” who become
trades unionists with the simple and definite
purpose of bringing the organisation into
conflict with the employers or the Govern-
ment on every possible occasion. The pro-
cedure of infiltration and agitation is set
forth with engaging candor in various Com-
munist publications. It is a point of policy
with the Communist “comrade” to deny
that he is a Communist and to tell any other
lie that will help the sacred cause of divorc-
ing the wage-slave from his wages.
The character of the Communist move-
ment can be judged by the fact that the
heads of the Railway Union—significantly
one of the most Communist-ridden in Aus-
tralia—told their Queensland members the
other day to sign anything and be ready to
repudiate it at any moment afterwards. The
time has come when good Australian union-
ists must decide whether that is the sort
of official and that the sort of advice they
really want.

Black Cloth and White Measure.
Some time ago the Papuan Government was
forced to the conclusion that civilisation
had so affected the local heathen that the
time had come to pass laws for the better
protection of white women and children.
The passing of this legislation was followed
by severe sentences on several offenders,
and it was hoped'that the unpleasant men-
ace would disappear. A few days ago, how-
ever, it became necessary in Port Moresby
to pass sentence upon three of these sexual
criminals. One received imprisonment for
life for an offence on a white "girl under
14, a second was handed six years, with 15
lashes, for attempting the same offence, and
a third got off lightly with three months for
peeping when the Sinabadas of the house-
hold wen; having a bath.
In a way it. is rough on Brown Brother.
A generation ago a white woman had noth-
ing to fear from the average Papuan tribe
bevond the possibility of being eaten. In
many parts of Papua the Government and
the Taparora, the latter especially", have
banned the old-time promiscuity, along
with the custom of plural marriage, that was
a real safeguard to European women. The
banning of these ancient customs was not
inevitable either, and on the shoulders of
those eager to compel Papuan savages to
observe the professed moral standards of
civilisation must lie most of the blame for
the new order of things. It is significant,
in this regard, that Port Moresby, the
native community in closest contact with
European ideals and culture, should be the
scene of most of the serious offences against
white women and girls to date.

Bad-tempered Government.
Whatever may be the judgment of pos-
terity concerning the consulship of J. T.
Lang, almost everybody" who lived under
it will look back upon it as a time in which
the domain of public affairs was hardly fever
free from nerve-racking rows and bad smells
and explosions of bad temper. . There never
was a political leader in any State who gave
his enemies more opportunities for caustic
criticism, or who turned more of his friends
into enemies. Tradition cast Mr. Lang
for a role in which a certain amount of
suavity, dignity and serenity is reckoned


becoming, and a touch of good humor
aporopriate. But for the last two years he
has never been without a fierce quarrel
on his hands. Except when his cour-
age oozed out of him and he skulked
behind his Red friends, he has con-
sistently played the part of a bad-
tempered bully. The last occasion of that
kind was when he accused certain officers
who administer child endowment with de-
liberately holding up claims. “I will deal
with them,” he roared, “after the election’
—as he dealt with Director-of-Finance
Stevens, it is presumed.
While continually exasperating all sorts
and conditions of people, the Premier is
himself exasperated to find that citizens
don’t share his exalted opinion of himself.
His utterances produce the impression that
he is nearly always angry, and that in his
own judgment he does well to be angry.
The atmosphere he creates is not that of
good and orderly government, and men of
peace and goodwill will welcome almost any
sort of change. The last Nationalist Admini-
stration inspired no enthusiasm, but it did
not engender hatred or arouse suspicion. It
wasn’t associated with a “bribery plot,” a
Ivay job, a party split or queer measures
like the Liquor Bill every few weeks.
Fuller, its leader, was a placid figure, even
if he did miss the ’bus occasionally. He
didn’t consider it his duty to be nearly
always in a temper, nor did he get on his
country’s nerves.
Under Bavin, who has some sense of
personal dignity and who is not bereft of
humor, New South Wales would not sound
like a dog-fight to outsiders, as it does
at present, and its politics would need no
disinfectant.

The Litigant at Large.
“It’s an abridgment of the rights of the
people,” shouted a Labor member in the
Vic. Leg. Assembly, wheti opposing a
measure designed to curb the zeal of irre-
sponsible suitors. But the House was not
with the declamatory gentleman, the facts
adduced having convinced it that legisla-
tion was necessary.
Since 1925 a litigious person has been
bombarding the Melbourne City Council
with writs. The aldermanic body metho-
dically defended the actions, 13 in
number, and won them all, but when it
went to collect its costs it could not obtain
a penny. And not content with his attack
on the city fathers, the litigious gentleman
fired writs at the Minister for Public Works,
the Railway Commissioners and the Tram-
ways Board, all of whom had to eat the
bitter fruit of a barren success. Something
had to be done, and an English precedent
was recalled. Over 30 years ago a litigious
crank in Britain launched 48 actions at per-
sons in social altitudes that seemed to lift
•them beyond legal potshots. The Prince
of Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury
and the Speaker of the House of Commons
were among the dignitaries aimed at. To
ring down the curtain on this wild burlesque
of legal process an Act of Parliament was
passed, and the manufacture of frivolous
actions incontinently ceased.
The Victorian measure has been drafted
on the lines of the English legislation. It
provides that if, on an application made
by a law officer, the Supreme Court is
satisfied that any person has habitually and
without reasonable ground instituted vexa-
tious legal proceedings, the Court may, after
hearing the litigant, order that no legal pro-
ceedings shall be instituted without its
permission. Before the Supreme Court can
grant leave to the litigant to go on his
litigious way it has to be satisfied that he
has at least a prima facie case. So that he
may have a fair run before their Honors
the measure provides that he can have
counsel assigned to him if he is too poor
to brief a gentleman of the long robe on
his own account.
Victoria is not the only community in
which frivolous actions are brought by men
of straw. It would be well if every other
State followed the example of Hogan’s
country and passed a Vexatious Actions
Act.

The Commonwealth’s Railways.
Dear Bulletin, —“Prickly Jack.” who
wrote on the above subject in B. 29/9/’27,
didn’t understand what I said nor what he
said himself, and even if liis remarks had
been accurate they were too trivial to be
worth making. It is asinine to say that “S.
Australia constructed the Port Augusta-
Oodnadatta line some decades before the
close of the nineteenth century and handed
it over to the Commonwealth in 1926 with
an annual interest bill undiminished.” Con-
struction extended over the very recent
period 1878-1891, and the railway became
Commonwealth property in 1911—that is to
say, it and the other fragment of the Soutb-
to-North line (the Northern Territory
fragment) were Federal institutions in full
work before the East-to-West job got into
going order. This makes what looks like
the faking of the accounts all the more re-
markable :
In 1920 the capital expenditure charged
against the big Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie rail-
way was £7,053,900, and the interest debited
to it was £222,352, or £3 3s. per cent. In
1926 capital expenditure was quoted as
£7,515,553. and the interest as £113,380. or a
shade over £1 10s. per cent. In 1922 the
interest charged was only £87,051, but it
went up again.
In 1920 the capital expenditure on the
Port Augusta-Oodnadattn railway was stated
as £2,282.934. and the interest as £80,048,
or about £3 10s. per cent. In 1926 capital
was described as £2,663,090, and interest as
£99,851, which was over £3 15s. per cent.
In 1920 the Northern Territory line had a
nominal capital expenditure of £1,709,932,
and the interest bill was £b1.215. or over £3
13 s. per cent. In 1926 the capital outlay was
put down at £1,736,360, and the interest at
£95,068, which was about £5 10s. per cent.
The silly statement of "Prickly jack”
about the East-to-West railway being partly
constructed out of revenue is disproved by
the fact that the whole cost of construction
carried the same interest rate as the other
railways paid—that is, of course, before the
accounts began to wander all over the shop.
On the other hand, the Northern Territory
line has been largely paid for out of revenue
—that is to say, the debt has been largely
paid off, though one would hardly think so
by the figures. The entire debt of the
Northern Territory at June, 1925 (I have no
later figures) was £1,192,419, though its un-
finished scrap of railway alone was charged
interest in that year on £1,727,412. “Prickly
Jack’s” statement that the completed East-
West line lost a mere £6569 last year reminds
me that the incomplete dead-end Northern
Territory line lost only £1893. One way and
another it seems that the accounts, though
perhaps pleasing in their present form to
Westralians, could stand a lot of eluci-
dation. Incidentally, it is one of the
troubles of journalism that one has so often
to write up a subject all over again because
of the butting-in of some “Prickly” person
who would have been better employed
gathering a thistle or two for breakfast. —
Yours ever, Bildad.
Slang-Whangism and the Country
Elector.
Although the N. S. Wales electors will
vote in new divisions on Saturday, the nine
five-member and 15 three-member districts
of the proportional-representation period
having been carved up into 90 single elec-
torates, not many seats can be classed as
doubtful. The fate of the Slang-Whang
Government will be decided in about a
dozen country constituencies. Both sides
realise this, and the advisers of the Slang-
Whangs have taken care to send crowds
of city unemployed, all Labor-unionists, to
country neighborhoods where such rein-
forcements can do most good, besides pro-
mising the country railways, irrigation works,
hydro-electric schemes, land resumptions,
doles, night-trotting and tin-hare coursing
° Yet if the Slang-Whangs should be
judged on their record, a rude shock awaits
them in the country, even though the elec-
toral machinery is under their control. Only
the hopelessly biased and gullible can be
insensible to the burdens they have heaped
on country districts and the litter of broken
pledges with which they have strewn the
political landscape. In his policy speech
two years ago, Slang-Whang undertook to
reduce railway freight rates (second-class
fares, too), and raised them instead;
pledged himself to lower the income-tax
and increased that also; volunteered to find
land for everyone who wanted it, mention-
ing 20,000 as the number he was prepared
to accommodate, and forgot all about it the
next week. The same Slang-Whang im-
posed on country factories, which have to
compete with Victorians subjected to no such
disabilities, the statutory 44-hour week, a
crude and excessively expensive workers’
compensation scheme and a child-endow-
ment tax of 3 p.c. on wages and salaries
paid.
This latest impost is so framed that the
more enterprising and productive and
generous a wagepayer is the harder he is
hit. Moreover, only a small portion of the
proceeds collected in the country remains
in the country, the greater part being distri-
buted among Slang-Whang’s clients in
Sydney and Newcastle. The 3 p.c. on the
wages bill is to be raised to 6i p.c., as in
the original measure, if the Slang-Whangs
get back. Slang and Whang will also be
free to impose the 10 p.c. rise in railway
charges sought by the Commissioners—de-
clared to be necessary, in fact. —to meet the
burdens laid on a once-profitable under-
taking by Whang and Slang. Visible re-
sults of all these measures and menaces
are Victorian agents booking orders at
prices which N.S.W. factories are unable to
quote, with increasing numbers of local un-
employed.
Another consideration which should weigh
with country electors is that the party now
calling itself Labor is not the Labor party
for which they voted so strongly in 1925.
The Country Labor section, so powerful
then, has been reduced to insignificance, if
it can be said to exist at all. Loughlin,
its good Australian leader, left the Govern-
ment and the party saying that the Premier
was a vain weakling who had surrendered
the Cause to “men alien to the spirit and
sentiment of Australia.” Gillies and Goodin
were thrown out in flat repudiation of an
agreement which provided, among other
things, that the representation taken from
the country under the redistribution scheme
now in force should be restored before the
general election. The A.W.U., which was so
largely represented in the A.I.F. and from
' which so many thousands of N.S.W. farmers
and graziers have come, has lost its position
as the leading political union. Its ascendancy
has been wrested from it by the coal-mining
organisation, which contains more immi-
grants and more Communists than any
other union in the Commonwealth. The
men “alien to the spirit and sentiment of
Australia” are supreme in this union and
in the Sydney Trades and Labor Council,
which is “affiliated” with Moscow and Han-
kow. They would get a frosty reception if
they showed themselves in the centre of the
stage and revealed their aims, instead of
lurking where the wires are pulled, for they
are the sort of people who were called
“Copperheads” in America during the Civil
War and “conchies” in Britain during the
Great War, with the quackeries of Musco-
vite socialism added. Nevertheless, they
will rule N. S. Wales through the puppet
Premier and his “Scabinet” if the country
elector doesn’t see through their game.
Those Commonwealth Powers.
‘Sol Malaprop”: The question is asked, at
this late hour, whether the Federal Gov-
ernment has any power under the Consti-
tution to own and run a line of mercantile
ships, or to be practical owner of Amal-
gamated Wireless or the Commonwealth
Oil Refinery, or to enter into any trading .
enterprise whatsoever. If the Constitution
enumerated the powers of the States and
left the rest to the Commonwealth, the
latter would always have the benefit of the
doubt. As it gives a list of the powers of
the Commonwealth (seriously curtailed of
late by High Court decisions) every blunder
and omission tells against the alleged
Central Authority.
Among the “Powers of the Parliament
(Clause 51), there is no mention of ship-
owning or trading in any form. It is said
that the Commonwealth can make laws
about “insurance other than State insur-
ance” and “banking other than State bank-
ing,” but it isn’t said that it can run a
bank or insurance office of its own. It can
also make laws about “the issue of paper
money,” and I suppose this means
that it can issue its own, but I am
not quite sure. The Commonwealth
can control railways “with respect to trans-
port for military and naval purposes.” It
can, in addition, acquire, with the consent
of a State, any of the State’s railways, and
it can do “railway construction and exten-
sion in any State” provided the State con-
sents. This isn’t specific about the right to
build and work railways in, say, the N.
Territory or Canberra, neither of which is
“in any State,” nor has any State Govern-
ment to give consent. The first 146 miles
of N. Territory line were acquired in ortho-
dox fashion from a State, but everything
else is fresh construction. Perhaps private
railways under Federal law would be legal,
or perhaps the N. Territory could be made
a State with a cheap and partially nominee
Legislature for consenting purposes.
I hope that the control of navigation and
shipping, inserted as an afterthought,
covers air navigation, but I understand
there are doubts. It seems to me that the
High Court may be in for a busy time.
The Young Crockery Republic.
News from China has diminished in quan-
tity and interest, and despite talk of pos-
sible Bolshevik interference it seems as if
a period of comparative quiet may be
looked for.
Presumably the antirforeign feeling still
exists, though much less has been heard of
it since the ferociously arrogant Russian
Communists who tried to take charge in
Canton have practically passed out of
notice. It is a very old feature in China.
Verv remote Chows described foreign races
which they had never met as barbarians and
foreign devils, and those Chinese Emperors
who occasionally addressed an ideograph to
a European potentate always alluded to him
as a subject. Friendly embassies often failed
to get in touch with the self-important
Flowery Throne because the envoy
objected, first, to being described as a
messenger bearing tribute, and, second, to
approaching the imperial presence on all
fours. An extreme case of misunderstand-
ing happened in 1860, when an Anglo-
French mission started on its way to the
capital to fix things up after a minor dis-
agreement. Chinese authority made the
mistake of arresting the envoys and their
retinue, and during the 10 days of torture
which followed 25 out of 36 died. This
naturally led to further complications.
But Emperors having ceased their plea-
santries, the seventh President of the
Crockery Republic took office in Pekin
three years ago and is still there if he
hasn’t been replaced by the eighth and
ninth. This is a good number in 15$ years,
especially as one of the party had two terms
of office and there was also an interim.
Among the matters charged against them
have been illegal election, election by a
dubiously legal body, and no election at
all. There have been either three or four
Parliaments, or alleged Parliaments, or
fragments of Parliaments in existence at
once. Some people hold the view that the
country might get along better with a
limited monarchy, the Emperor being a
Chinaman instead of a Manchu, for nobody
has ever run a real or even half-real re-
public in Asia. In former days there was
a sketchy army or a lot of sketchy little
armies, but owing to various causes, of
which Japan was the most violent, it was
decided that a real army was essential.
Unfortunately when President Yuan Shi-
K’ai passed out certain generals thought
that the joke was finished, and went off in
different directions, each taking his division
with him as his private property. Some of
them were ex-brigands and took to the
free life naturally. Yuan didn’t really
amount to much as a statesman, but ho
sometimes looked as if he was going to.
An ex-British consul w T ho had consulled in
China as far west as Tibet thus describes
the lot of an inland provincial governor:—
It was all the aftermath of revolution.
Each satrap had to support himself on his
own domains. Most of them had armies
so swollen that they could not so support
them. If, however, this general or that was
to reduce his forces, and cut his coat accord-
ing to his cloth, he would inevitably be
swallowed up by his neighbor acting on the
opposite principle of increasing his area to
meet his expenses. General disbandment by
consent? But who is to make the men in
power disband if they do not want to ?
And the troops themselves are unwilling to
be disbanded.... They have rifles in their
hands, and if one general does not want
them another will. If nobody wants them,
better be brigands than starve.
It is explained that this was a particularly
high-class governor, though he had flogged
merchants, one of them fatally, for being
behind with their taxes. But the picture
doesn’t suggest fast-growing efficiency on
the part of the republic.

Hitting the Wrong Head.
“Nepenthe”: The N.S.W. Dangerous Drugs
Act was passed by the Lang Government,
so, naturally, it is unsatisfactory. It exhibits
all the signs of crude and hasty workman-
ship as well as a lack of knowledge con-
cerning the situation with regard to narcotic-
drug addiction. It fails to draw any
distinction between the commercial drug-
trafficker, who extorts the last possible
penny from his victims, and the addict
whose failing may have been due to painful
illness or the carelessness of an attendant,
and who would shake it off were he able.
The same penalties for either are prescribed.
They will fall lightly on the trafficker, who
will pay his fine and scarcely miss it from
the huge proceeds of the business; but the
impecunious addict will have to go to gaol.
Another respect in which the A.ct falls
short is in the regulation which lays it
down that no doctor shall give a prescrip-
tion to satisfy addiction. This naturally
cuts out what is known as the “gradual
withdrawal” method of treatment, the only
method available to many whose means do
not permit of their entering upon sani-
tarium or private-hospital treatment, but
for whom a cure is possible at the hands
of a sympathetic physician understanding
perfectly the method of gradually reducing
the dosage each day, until a point is reached
at which it may be broken off. Even such
drugs as codeine and dionin, to which addic-
tion is unknown, but which are of
great value in curing the habit, since they
are able to replace the stronger narcotics,
are under the ban because they are deriva-
tives of the more powerful bases. Thus, a
doctor is prevented from prescribing the
very compounds which are relied upon by
many in the treatment of the habit outside
institutions.
The only effect in the underworld, so far,
has been to cause a rise in prices among the
illicit traders.
The furious denunciations of Sydney Labor
member and boot manufacturer Minahan,
whose offence is that he doesn’t wave the
red flag, as a “capitalist” call for some
definition of the term. A “capitalist,” in
the Red vocabulary, is a man with some
money or some credit who supplies other
men with honest employment at productive
industry, and he is loathed and denounced
accordingly. A much richer man who
doesn’t supply work or wages or house-room
generally isn’t a “capitalist,” and is neither
loathed nor denounced. Thus Theodore
might possess more wealth than Minahan
—and he possibly does —but so long as he
didn’t risk his money in productive enter-
prise the opprobrious epithet wouldn’t be
thrown at him. Nor would it be thrown
at Premier Lang, who sticks to a non-
producing middleman job—the kind at
which a girl clerk or two generally suffices.
No matter how much riches a man may
accumulate by bookmaking or the like, he
is never denounced for “capitalism” like the
Minahans and McKays. It is difficult to
know the rules of the game, but one _of
them is to be always in a rage and wanting
to break something useful.
♦
Having learnt something from the tragic
happenings of two years ago and the nearly
tragic happenings of last year, Melbourne
is pushing ahead with the organisation of a
voluntary fire brigade to attend blazes in
the bush within a radius of 60 miles of the
G.P.O. It is proposed to enlist a force of
2000 young men, ready at any moment to
drop their picks and pens and proceed to
the strategic points. The Royal Auto-
mobile Club is organising transport and
calling for relays of motorists to carry out
patrols right through the fire season. Volun-
teers have to agree to attend parades in
likely areas for training purposes.

Henderson, British M.P., lately went over
to Belgium to unveil a memorial to an
Italian Bolshevik M.P., and gave Fascism
beans for “banishing, torturing, destroying
and slaying.” Still, the Italians have a
sneaking regard for it. They had a spell of
Bolshevism just before the Fascist! arrived,
and the Bolsh element “took over” the fac-
tories wherever they could. One result was
that the output of the Fiat works fell from
1000 cars per month to 40, and the 40, being
about, as rudimentary as Pharaoh’s bicycle,
found no buyers. As another instance, dur-
ing last year Italy, which Fascists, added
211,969 tons to its aggregate shipping and
stood at the head of the world’s list of ship-
owning States for progress; while Russia,
which Bolshies, added 1027 tons and was at
or close to the tail. The picture of Fascism’s
tortured victims, to say nothing of the
banished and the slain, building all these
ships amidst' their agonies is unconvincing.

POLITICAL
POINTS
One queer result of the Labor-socialist
Liquor Bill which, together with the measure
providin'- for heaps more proprietary racing,
was the principal business done during the
promised “rural session,” is that a diner
can’t get Australian wine at the Govern-
ment’s Central Station cafe unless he orders
and pays for it before 6 p.m. But at private
hotels a few hundred yards away he can
get wine with his meal up to S p.m. with-
out any preliminary fuss. Minahan, M.L.A.,
blames “golden lightning” for these eccen-
tric effects.
The reduction of Federal income-tax
and land-tax by 10 per cent, ought, other
things not intervening, to mean a saving to
the people of the Commonwealth of about
£1,700,000—0r about |d. a head. One of
the things that might intervene in New
South Wales would be the return of the
Slang-Whangs at next Saturday’s poll.
The avidity with which the Ma State’s
“saved” £700,000 would be mopped up by
the Slang-Whangs can be imagined.
The stiffening up of the Australian tariff
rates on motor chassis is, of course, an
attempt to give British motor manufacturers
a little more preference and stem the rising
tide of Yankee imports. Last year Australia
imported £67.240,000 worth of stuff from
John Bull and £41,183,000 worth from Uncle
Sam. Another three-quarter million can
safely be tacked on to the last figure in
respect of under-valued fillums. Year by
year Sam’s quota is getting nearer to
Bull’s share, but he shows no desire to dis-
pute Bull’s position as Australia’s best
customer. British chassis, unassembled,
now come in free, but when the long-talked-
of Australian-made car gets into production
the Britishers will probably be asked to pay
a duty.
The inquiry before three Royal Commis-
sioners, aided by eight or ten barristers, as
to whether one or two comments on tlial
sensitive plant Piddington, of child-endow
ment celebrity, were too harsh proved a busi-
ness of weeks, and the cost is estimated al
£l2O per hour. Contributions to the child
endowment fund are large if the contribu-
tor’s wage-sheet is large and not otherwise,
and as Judges and barristers don’t employ
horny-handed toilers in quantity the pro-
portion of that £l2O per hour which went
to the support of a kiddy or two was
limited. Possibly the man who repaired the
Court’s boots had to pay more than the whole
Court.
Labor seems to be well set in Vic.
Assembly at present. It has 28 of its own
crowd solid, four Progs, almost as solid
and four friendly Oppositionists. Of course,
the legislation being submitted is such as
any moderate country Government might
bring forward, but Hogan, in the Assembly,
and Jones, in the Council, are acquiring a
mastery that Allan and Richardson never
held.
To the great surprise of T. K. Sidey,
of South Dunedin, who drafted the bill
18 years ago, Maoriland has gone in for
daylight-saving. In future, on the first
Sunday in November householders will
have to rise at 2 a.m. and put the clock
on an hour. And on the first Sunday in
March they must climb out of bed at 2 a.m.
and put the clock back an hour. It’s a
form of Coueism that has been adopted by
older countries in corresponding latitudes,
though it was an utter failure in Australia.
In the United States the dodge is optional
in some States and cities; but in New Hamp-
shire there’s a fine of 500 dollars for tamper-
ing with clocks in any way.
N.S.W. Premier Slang, whose coherence
doesn’t improve, hurried up to Armidale to
promise the immediate construction of a rail-
way from Guyra to the coast if he gets back
to power, and to assure the population that
he is the only person who will do it, Codlin
being the friend and not Short. The urgent
demand is for the whole line from lnverell
to the coast, but Codlin overlooked that.
He explained that he didn’t get busy on the
line earlier because, if he had sent the neces-

rary bill to the Upper House without the
legal formality of getting the consent of the
Public Works Committee, the U.H. would
have thrown if out. Why he didn’t get the
consent of the P. W. Committee he failed to
say. Then he announced himself the builder
of a long list of lines, including some that
were opened six years before he got his first
portfolio, and after that CodHn fled for home
to see if Minahan had annexed his electorate.
By 29 votes to 15 Vic. Leg. Assembly
rejected Dick Toutcher’s motion for an
elective executive, with Ministers individu-
ally responsible to Parliament. Four Cockies
(ex-Premier Allan among them), the four
Country Progs., five Nats, and two Opposi-
tion Independents made up the minority.
Had the debate been an academic one and
judged on points, the speakers on the affirma-
tive side would have won easily. Toutcher
need not lose heart. Consider what is hap-
pening in respect to the tote. In 1923 a
handful of members voted for Morley’s bill;
now it looks as if Hogan can carry the
measure he proposes.
Killen, M.H.R. for Riverina, lately asked
the Prime Minister if it would be possible
to do S. Australia out of the N. Territory
railway and “make the road passable for
traffic instead,” and Bruce, instead of bid-
ding him go where the worm is a standing
institution, said he might see the S.A. Gov-
ernment about it. Killen said that the N.T.
is “practically a desert,” and the line would
have _ “practically nothing to carry except
occasionally a few cattle, and must entail an
enormous annual loss.” Yet the unfinished
N.T. railway came within £1893 of paying
working expenses in 1920, which was better
than the record of 17 N.S.W. railways, or 52
Queensland ones. Almost at the same
minute Foil, of Queensland, was shouting
iu the Senate for a Federal railway
through his own State because it is “prac-
tically a desert,” for the time at least. This
work is to carry “occasionally a few sheep.”
The Labor Mayor of Rockhampton is one
of those old-style Laborites —rather rare
nowadays—who refuse to pander to the
mania for betting. He has a particular set
on goat-racing, not as a spectacle, but
because boys and girls gamble on it as they
gamble on the dog-racing ushered in by the
Lang crowd in contempt of Parliament. For
this antiquated devotion to principle he has
been expelled from "the movement.” So
if Gosling, the N.S.W. Minister for Tin
Hares, gets licked on Saturday, he should
know where to go.
The League of Nations has been invited
to put down the trade in opium with a
heavy hand. One of the difficulties is that
the Japanese Government, though prohibit-
ing opium in Japan, has encouraged the
growth of the poppy as a source of revenue
in Korea. Another is that the Shanghai
Opium Suppression Board has changed into
an encouragement board, and has devised
a comprehensive scheme for turning the
liabit into money with which to finance the
“National” cause and the long-drawn-out
scrap attached. Even in its greatest drug-
importing days China grew about half its
own supply of opium, and though there was
a considerable reduction at one time the
area of poppy cultivation is said to have
extended greatly since 1912.
The Bruce-Page Government is struggling
hard to get rid of the Commonwealth ship-
ping line and to keep it at the same time.
The concern has been written down by 10
millions or so, and doesn’t earn a profit even
on the petty nominal capital; in fact, it
doesn’t earn a profit on anything. It can't
be enlarged except by acquiring new ships
with loan money, and then writing off most
of the price as lost in order to fake the
accounts into some semblance of solvency,
and even then making more losses. The
ships can’t be replaced when they wear out
or burn or sink, except by more loans and
still more losses, for there is no reserve to
meet any emergency. The seven vessels cost
about £220.000 a year more to run than they
would if a British company ran them on
British principles, and to lose as much as
£598,579 in order to provide £220.000 extra
for a class which shows no special gratitude
is over the odds, especially considering the
debilitated state of the finances.
Melb. University Council took with it
representatives of 17 other bodies when it
called on Vic. Premier Ilogan to ask
for an endowment of £112,000 instead
of the present £45,000 a year. All
Ilogan could promise on the spur of the
moment was sympathy. The ' Varsity govern-
ing body was slow in getting off the mark,
having reached the Treasury eight days after
the delivery of the Budget; and then it
opened its mouth too widely. If it had re-
quested £15.000 extra this year, and £lO.OOO
a year additional for the succeeding four
years, it might have gripped the Govern-
ment's attention.
Federal Laoor-mombers Theodore, Charl-
ton and others decided to throw in their
weight with the Red crowd in N.S.W., and
with the minority Ministry which Lang
(or Willis) picked, instead of having a selec-
tion by caucus. At an Eight-Hours dinner
the visitors vied with Lang, Stokes and the
rest in a final gasp of promises, the most
striking being a 40-hours’ week with 48
hours’ pay. The employer class, which is to
find the money or cease employing, was
naturally not represented except in so far that
there might be a person here and there with
an office and a harmless clerk or two. The
thing most wanting was a promise that book-
makers would be compelled to improve the
punter’s lot by laying compulsory basic odds,
and something might also be done about the
publican giving a larger basic drink. If the
manufacturer is called on, by the change
from 48 hours to 40, to give one-sixth mon
money for the same work, there is nothing
amiss with one-sixth more drink for the same
money.
Queensland has had a board at work re-
viewing tin- pastoral industry, which was
in poor health even before the drought. The
board has made a variety of suggestions all
pointing towards milder treatment, and has
even admitted that rentals and taxes are
often liarsli and burdensome. “Not only
may a grazier be taxed on a fictitious income,
but the rate of tax may be double that
applied to a person receiving the same aver-
age income over a term of years.” Theodore
had the same idea of the grazier’s bottom-
less purse as Lang has of the manufacturer’s,
the reason being that Theodore didn’t graze
and Lang doesn’t manufacture—except unre-
liable statements.
Vic. Labor Chief Sec. Prendergast has been
stirring up State-subsidised free libraries to
patronise Australian literature to the extent
of at least 10 per cent, of their annual outlay.
Replies are encouraging. Some committees of
management said that for years they had
been doing more than Prendergast suggested;
others promised to fall in line.
Peter Loughlin, the N.S.W. democrat who
gave up his high position in Ministry and
caucus rather than dance to strings pulled
by imported persons like Willis, Garden,
Voigt, Gosling and Chapman, has fought
a fine lone-hand campaign in Young. He
has a Langite and a Country-party man
against him, and some of the C.P. officials
say they don’t care whether Loughlin or the
Langite gets their side’s second votes. It is
a foolish attitude, for if Loughlin hadn’t
sacrificed himself the Nats, and Cockies
wouldn’t have been able to settle accounts
with the Reds this year; moreover, Loughlin
believes in elective ministries, as do the
Cockies, and has shown that he can be
trusted to support the principle in the House.
Both Cockies and Nats, should recommend
their followers to vote in the order of their
preference for anti-Red candidates, after
putting their own man first. In Bondi, per-
haps, “Sandy” Jaques will be preferred to
the selected Nationalist, and the same thing
may happen in other electorates where two
or more Nationalists are standing; but the
party won’t suffer, provided the preferences
are exercised.

declared that the sum of £30,00U was connected

The thing was rushed through Parliament, he alleges,
at the expense of several vital measures, and, as all
could testily, the catch-cry at the time was ‘What

“Yarri”: I took my girl to a race-ball one
night in a little town in the Mount Browne
(N.S.W.) district, where everybody was
expecting a joyous time. But as soon as
we had passed the doorkeeper that idea
received a rude shock. The assemblage was
divided into two classes, the silver tails
occupying one end of the room and the cop-
pertails the other. Some snob —or some
humorist, I don’t know which —had drawn
a chalk line across the floor so that the
eoppertails would not encroach beyond their
proper domain. Naturally there was much
aggressive bumping, besides other unpleasant-
nesses, on the frontier, and occasionally indi-
viduals of the two parties came into more
serious conflict, which led to warm invita-
tions to come outside. Finally, the silver-
tails put on a boundary-rider, who patrolled
the dividing space and kept order till a pair
of heavyweights crashed into him and
knocked him through the doorway. The
dance broke up early, but the feelings, engen-
dered by the chalk line lasted a long time.

“C. iCoral”: At Murray Island (Torres
Strait) a couple of weeks back a child
picked up a gleaming yellow coin on the
sandy beach. It proved to be Spanish—a
“piece of eight” dated 1810. The coin, which
was in such excellent preservation that it
might have only recently left the mint, was
bought by a Thursday Island resident. Quite
possibly the action of the sea has broken
up some hidden chest of treasure; local tra-
dition still tells of the sinking of a ship
outside the Barrier, four miles ofT. and of
a raft-load of men coming ashore with cases.
The men, it is said, were killed; and,
according to the natives, the cases were
sunk or buried. It was only a few miles
away that the late Frank Jardinc’s fishing
boat recovered a considerable amount of
Spanish gold and silver coin from the wreck
of an old ship, much of it dating back to
1735.

“Clievroford”: A quaint spectacle during
Show week was an expensive car towing a
cow into Melbourne. I met it 10 miles out.
Considering the damage travelling for long

was probably the most costly method of
transport the owner could have used.
“The Gaffer” : An elegant piece of alder-
manic persiflage at a Sydney Council meet-
ing has seriously
intrigued local
philologists. One
of the sturdy bur-
gesses, goaded by
a rival's sneers,
referred to his
insulter and
another as a pair of

prising daily in-
vited a symposium
of eminent citizens
to give a ruling on
the meaning and
derivation of the
word, and encoun-
tered an atmo-
sphere of dens®
haziness. Yet the
expression is com-
m o n Australian
slang. The botfly,
an internal para-
site of horses and
cattle, feeds on t In*
juices of its unwill-
ing hosts; the
human “bot” hangs
round the skirts of
drinking parties in
the frowsier type

when the drunk or
the mug has
shouted. He is also
in evidence when

ho couldn’t get into gaol was Melbourne s
latest phenomenon. Me had been sentenced
to a week for prevarication about a motor-
car, and the tender-hearted beak allowed
him to go home to tell the wife on the under-
standing that he would return within an
hour. The prevaricator returned in due
course and notified an official to that effect,
but the official said he was too busy to see
him. So rather than disappoint King George
lie went round to the gaol liimselfi That
institution was as reluctant to receive him
as a city hotel at Cup time, and he actually

bourne before he finally got back to the
court again and lodged his grievance with

“The Hound” : There have been bitter com-
plaints lately from market-gardeners between
Cheltenham and Dandenong (Vic.) about
the depredations wrought by unknowns who
drive along on dark nights in motor-trucks,
pull in beside vegetable fields and openly load
the trucks with cabbages and other available
flora. The other night a resident noticed
four dark figures gathering vegetables with
suspicious celerity a little distance from an
unlighted truck standing in the roadway.
Before departing to round up the Johns, the
sagacious man abstracted the motor ignition-
key, and when the law arrived on the scene
the thieves had departed en masse, leaving
a collection of fresh-smelling cabbages in the
immovable motor. The Johns patted them-
selves on the back and drove the truck into
town, certain of locating .the owner through
the registration office. They located him all
right. His truck had been pinched from the
street by the vegetarians immediately before
they set" out on their mission.

“Clerk”: The W.A. Railway Department
isn’t the only one that occasionally receives

recently sent along two penny-ha’penny
stamps with the penitent explanation that
he had once used an official envelope to post
a private letter, and that, unable to endure
the tortures of an accusing conscience, he
had decided to make restitution. Perhaps
his ultra-sensitiveness balances to _ some
extent the lax moral sense of other railway-
men. This par., for instance, has been
written in railway time and is being punched
on railway paper by a railway typewriter

“Chevroford”: Melbourne boasts of the
humorous anomaly of a street in which what
is legal on. one. side is an offence on the
other. The dividing line between Richmond
and Collingwood runs down the centre _of
Victoria-parade. Thus, a motorist travelling
east can pass a stationary tram without
infringing the law, but one who does it
when heading westward is liable to be haled
before a beak. Richmond Council doesn't
think the anomaly absurd at all. In a
recent week it raked in £2O from bewildered
breakers of its traffic regulation.

“Huffin-Guffin”: It is hard to give up the
lure of moneymaking. At Horsham (Vic.)
a good many district wheat-farmers, having
had a run of good seasons and prices, have
settled down to live as their affluence entitles
them to. On the front fence of the most
luxurious-looking mansion of the lot the fol-
lowing takes the eye: “Notice to Anglers:
Worms For Sale.”

“Areljay”: I have encountered some pro-
fane parrots in my time; at Cooranbong
(N.S.W.) I came across a bird which showed
the good influences of a religious training.
Most of the inhabitants of the village are
Seventh Day Adventists, a large number be-
ing lay preachers, and this parrot had evi-
dently listened-in at sufficient discussions to
give him a denominational bent. Anyhow,
lie greeted me with “The Seventh Day is
the Sabbath,” as though he was trying to
provoke an argument with an unbeliever, and
interlarded the information with snatches of
hymns and texts. If only for the rarity of
his sentiments I should say he would bring
a good price in a city birdsliop.'

“Abo” : Many and varied are the excuses
offered by prospective jurymen in the effort
to escape service, but one given in Mel-
bourne last week bore the imprint of truth.
The list had been called, and all the excuses
heard, when an old chap got up and, more
in sorrow than in anger, said, “You never
called my name!” “What is it?” he was
asked. The question had to be shouted in
his ear after vain attempts in softer tones ;
then he gave a name that the crier had called
loudly and ineffectually three times. “Why,”
said ’Sonah, “you were lined £2 for non-
attendance. Didn’t you hear your name
called?” The ancient explained that he was
so deaf that he hadn’t heard. The Judge
excused him without even swearing him.
OFF-STAGED.

“Preaching in Westminster Abbey, the Bishop of
Birmingham declared that the triumph of Dar-
winism had made the story of Adam and Eve simply
folk-lore.”
Farewell, Adam! And Eve, vale!
Topple it over, the Eden tree,
Branded for fairy-tale and flam
By Barnes, the Bishop of Birmingham.
Ne'er may we feature the pair again,
Mother of women and father of men,
Tempter and tempted to disobey,
Leading and weakly led astray,
Leaving the price for us to pay.
Twasn’t tlieir fault we must toil and twist
From moru.ng glory to evening mist,
How could it be when they didn’t exist?
Our primal parents, if you please,
Were up, not under, the primal trees.
(’lass it: with Jack and the Beanstalk yarns,
The Eden story, says Bishop Barnes.
Eve and Adam, you’ve had your run,
Ev’n as Pyrrha and Deucalion.
And the Eden tree that was loaded with
The orange pippin or Granny Smith,
Science has spurned it long for myth.
Now even a saintly bishop shies
At a scheming Satan in snaky guise,
Potent for evil and versed in lies.
While the Angel goes with his Flaming
Sword
And the rest of the outfit overboard.
No more shall the Biblical dispute
Just where there flourished Forbidden Fruit,
Or the traveller wander to and fro
Between where the Two Great Hi vers flow
In the Mespot swamps its site to trace,
Because, you see, there was no such place.
LOOKING AHEAD.
“What! You scared of his colored past?”
“No, of his camouflaged future.”
Back to the shadows, fig-leaved twain,
Back into fable’s vague domain!
I'm loath to lose you, I must confess,
If only because of your humanness.
But the world grows wise and you needs
must leave;
A long farewell to you, Adam and Eve!

“Pip Tok” : Few words have
degenerated with such rapidity as
the once pleasantly sounding
“comrade.” In the army not
many years ago it stood for
everything which is denoted by
“mate” in civil life. Regiments
had their Old Comrades’ Asso-
ciations ; “loyalty to one’s com-
rades” were words constantly
used by officers when trying to
stimulate esprit de corps, while
“stealing from a comrade” (still
the official phrasing of the
charge) was the most contemp-
tible sin in the soldiers’ deca-
logue. But call a man “com-
rade” in a barrack-room now-
adays and you are liable to buy
a fight in full working order.
The British equivalent of the
Returned Soldiers’ League used
to be called “The Comrades of
the Great War Association.”
That of South Africa was simi-
larly named, and the South Afri-
can returned soldiers’ paper used
to be called The Comrade. The
names of all these institutions
have been altered since the word
has become debased by associa-
tions with the unsavory heelers
of Moscow.

“Centurion”: The impossi-
bility of tieing down a conquered
people by treaty provisions is
clearly illustrated by the
accounts of the new German
cruisers launched in March and
August of this year. The Treaty
of Versailles forbade the build-
ing of warships above 6000 tons
displacement. The new ships,
the Konigsberg and the Karls-
ruhe, are the limit, displacement,
with hulls of welded, and not
riveted, steel. They are driven
by geared turbines fed from oil-
burning boilers, and the contract
speed is to be 32 knots. For
ordinary cruising they will use.
a separate unit of Diesel engines
with an oil radius of 6000 miles.
But the chief catch is in the
armament. The treaty laid down
that 6in. guns should be the
maximum, but forgot to limit the
number. So these small craft
mount nine of them, in three
three-gun turrets; and since
they are the last word in Krupp
gunnery, firing a shell of 1011 b.
with a range of 20,000 yards, it
will be easily seen that they
ignore the spirit of the treaty
while conforming to the letter.
Secondary armament includes
four 3.4 anti-aircraft guns,
which can be utilised in other
directions, and 12 torpedo-tubes.

“Coot”: In addition to
“Bleeds” Fitchett (B. 22/9/’27),
several Victorian parsons have
contributed to Australian litera-
ture. Donald Mac Lean’s “Man
from Curdie’s River.” was a
good seller a few years ago, and
he has published a couple of
other novels. Larry Rentoul
was no mean poet, and has two
volumes of verse to his credit.
John Mathew wrote “Eagleliawk
and Crow,” one of the authori-
tative works on aboriginal life and language,
and also published a book of verse. David
Hennessy is the author of several novels,
one of which secured second prize in a Ilod-
der and Stoughton competition. F. W. Bore-
ham’s works are better known in England
and America than here. Dr. Norwood, of
the City Temple, Lojidon, was born at
Bendigo, and published a volume of addresses
to children before leaving Australia. Henry
Howard was responsible for several books
before going to the U.S.A. And the late
Lorimer Fison was an authority on
aboriginal lore and published a collection of
Fijian folk-tales.
* * * *
“Nitric”: Professor Ewart, of Melbourne
University, who is at present conducting
some scientific investigations of North-West
Australia, lias discovered, among other
things, that the juice of a plant common
throughout the continent (Indigofera lino-
phylla) and not previously suspected of
being poisonous, contains a highly toxic
principle in its sap. A little of the clear
sap administered as an intra-venous injec-
tion acts as a tremendously powerful stimu-
lant on the heart; it will even cause it to
beat with such rapidity and violence as to
burst the blood-vessels. A tablespoonful
proved sufficient to kill a horse in a few
minutes, and half a teaspoonful settled a
goat inside of half an hour. The plant when
taken through the stomach has a relatively
feeble action. It is possible that this new
discovery may be utilised in small quantities
as a heart stimulant. It is probably related
to the alkaloid cygnin, which also occurs in
Western Australian poison bushes (Gastro-
lobium). Professor Ewart found the aborig-
inals’ knowledge of plants to be almost neg-
ligible, and, where it did exist, it was only
connected with their stomachs. This rather
upsets an old theory.

“Caveman” : Touching these men of many
callings (B. 22/9/’27). Here is a log of my
efforts to keep body and soul together since
I first started out: School-teacher, sailor
(windjammer), shipping-clerk, shearing-shed
hand, swagman, ’possum trapper, net fisher-
man, soldier (A.1.F.), clerk, banana-farmer,
surveyor’s draughtsman, signwriter and
painter, commercial photographer, and (if
this may be considered a bona-fide occupa-
tion) free-lance journalist. Of the lot the
life on the windjammer was the most inter-
esting. Fishing was good sport, 'but not
very remunerative. The shipping-clerk’s job
offered some fine pickings, of which the less
REASON FOR JOY.
“At the latest city assessment, the value of land in Sydney has advanced from £44,000,000 to
£61,000,000. Tammany persons have mentioned the increase with pride.”
INQUIRER: “What’s the great joy about the bloke growing so fat?”
TAMMANY OFFICIAL: “You can slip your hand into his pocket without him noticing it.”
said the better. Humping Matilda was good
for the nerves but bad for the pocket, and
school-teaching was bad for both. Banana-
growing promised well, but the bottom fell
out of the game when disease arrived.
Signwriting and draughtsmanship are use-
ful gifts, which still bring in stray quids at
odd times. Photography is a snare, as the
money looks easy but isn’t. And free-lance
journalism is an invention of the Evil One
himself.
* * * *
“Speculum”: According to the cableman,
a London charlatan recently obtained the
handsome sum of £92 for a love-philtre, the
purchaser being a credulous woman who
sought to recapture the affections of an
unfaithful husband. The love-philtre is one
of the oldest of quasi-medical expedients,
and doubtless dates back to the time when
certain plants were found to have narcotic
action which made them valuable as agents
of seduction. Mandrake and gensing were
supposed to have an additional value because
their roots often resembled the human form;
thus they combined medicine and magic.
In mediajval times the love-philtre enjoyed
a great vogue, almost every known drug
being experimented with, in addition to
the blood of bats and red-haired persons, the
hearts of toads and vipers, sea-holly, myrtle,
ambergris and mistletoe. The more direct
aphrodisiacs contained stimulants, and were
highly popular with the gallants. Later,
the reputed qualities of Spanish fly and
kindred insects are attested by two lines from
Gay-
Then flies into his mug I’ll throw
And soon the swain with love will glow.
In France, the Court of the Grand Mon-
arch liberally patronised the philtre-maker.
Madame de Montespan used various con-
coctions, in addition to black magic, in her
endeavors to retain the love of the wayward
Louis; Madame de Pompadour, realising her
own frigidity, sought to correct it with
vanilla and celery soup. In the recent
English case the expensive love-philtre
appears to have contained nothing more
invigorating than soda.

“Yabbie”: There were few nooks and
crannies in the U.K. into which Diggers
didn’t penetrate, with or without leave. Two
of them turned up one summer day in an
old-world village in the Highlands, where
the ancient kirk contains a great bell which
has never, as far as man’s memory goes back,
been rung except at some time of national
rejoicing or of national calamity. Unable
to obtain beds at the only inn, the two
Billjims were glad, to accept the innkeeper's
offer of blankets, and about midnight
departed to find a suitable place for
a shakedown. At 6 a.m. next morning
the hallowed bell gave forth loud, insistent
peals suggestive of a German air-raid.. The
publican’s son ran hot-foot to the kirk to
find out what was wrong. He came back
grinning. “It’s only those Australians; they
want to know what time the bar opens.”
The pair had camped beneath the lea of the
venerable edifice, and found the belfry door
unlocked when they went prospecting around
in the morning.

“Alwyn”: The weather-worn turret clock
which regulates the quarter-hour chimes in
the bell tower of St. John’s, Darlinghurst,
a fashionable Anglican place of worship,
is a copy of one in Cambridge. England. It
is the only turret clock in N. S. Wales with-
out a dial. The ancient ship’s bell installed
at the adjoining parish school came from the
wreck of the Dunbar.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: “Some of you motorists seem to
think us blokes are gorgons,” said the traffic
cop. “The other day a young woman stalled
half-way across the intersection. I went
across to help her out —I drive a car meself.
When I got across I found the bus was
empty. Coupler hours later the lady’s
brother turned up at the police-station to
claim the car. She’d just lost her nerve and
skipped out on the offside when she saw me
coming!”
* * * *
“K. Nife”: In some cases, at least, you
can tell a surgeon by his scars. The other
day at Sydney Hospital a medico was exam-
ining a young woman from Tasmania. He
came upon an artistic little scar. “Dr.
Rattan did that,” he suggested, and he was
right. The Speck surgeon is noted for his
small incisions; and this one was admired
by Sydney brothers of the craft.
♦ H* *
“Pip Tok”: There was frequently method
in the epistolary madness of the Digger who
maintained a correspondence with several
young ladies. My own batman stated the
case for the energetic letter-writer. “You
see, sir,” he explained, “every letter I write
means a couple of pairs of socks with the
reply.”

“Hamer”: An acquaintance of mine trea-
sures the first legal document issued in
Papua. It is a summons (written out in
longhand with two “t’s” to “Bri-
tannic”) to appear at the High
Commissioner’s Court in Kicrn-
punu for conduct liable to cause
a breach of the peace; the date
is Sept. 30, 1885, and P. 11.
Scratcliley’s personal signature
is scraAvled at the bottom. The
culprit, one of the crew of the
s.s. Governor Blackall, of the
A. S. N. Co., had gone ashore
to see the village against orders;
possibly that would have been
overlooked in the celebrations
over the hoisting of the British
flag only that one of the party,
having had some trade tobacco
stolen from him, sailed into a
nigger, and Authority seized the
opportunity of showing Black
Brother the impartiality of
British justice. The case was
duly called and impressively
adjourned, but Scratcliley died
on the Governor Blackall on the
trip south to Townsville, and
that was the last heard of the
matter.

“Glen A.” : Sydney’s first Par-
liamentary election, held on June
15, 1843, must have been a stir-
ring affair. The voting in one
ward (Gipps) ceased soon after
mid-day, owing to the activities
of two warring factions in the
vicinity of the booth. The row
began with a violent attack
made by a number of Capt.
O’Connell’s supporters on Coun-
cillor Jones; the historian of
the period records that a party
of sailors off a handily-
moored whaler flung them-
selves enthusiastically into the
fray and wielded harpoons with
deadly effect. In other parts
of the town law and order were
set at similar defiance, all the
sashes and windows of the Aus-
tralian Hotel, in Lower George-
street, being demolished by the
rioters, and the house of one
Samuel Lyons, higher up in the
same street, being stormed by
the mob. As soon as it was dark
the military were called out. but
they could only partially check
the Donnybropk. The election
resulted in a liollow win for W.
O. Wentworth and Dr. Bland,
Captain O’Connell, William
Hustler and Robert Cooper
being among the unsuccessful
candidates.

“Coot”: The State schools of
Victoria include among their
assets 152 plantations of pine-
trees. The areas vary from one
acre to 70, and this year 150,000
trees have been planted. The
plantations are scattered
throughout the State, and, con-
sidering that the idea was only
instituted in 1923, the progress
already made is remarkable.
The aim is to plant approxi-
mately an acre a year, so that
the trees may mature at dif-
ferent periods. It is intended
to devote the profits to scholar-
ships, and to providing special
equipment for the schools inter-
ested. Many of the areas are
Crown lands, but in some cases
public-spirited citizens have pre-
sented the necessary ground.
The plantations are not only
developing in the children an
interest in forestry, but they
provide useful object-lessons for
public bodies.

Love sometime persuade, entreat;
Whisper, leaning very near,

Tear your heart to like distress,
Yet I listen, all in vain,
For your spoken tenderness;
Shall I find your love sustain
In my sorrow, in my pain?

“Sol M.”: A divorce case which some of
the papers, curiously enough, described as
“tangled,” got through a preliminary stage
recently in Sydney. Florence asked the Judge
to annul her marriage with Douglas, alleging
that when it took place his first wife, Alice,
was still alive. Douglas countered with the
statement that he was never really married io
Alice because when he and she went through
the ceremony her first husband, Patrick, was
in the land of the living. Patrick is possibly
dead now, for Alice is married to, or goes by
the name of, someone who is neither he nor
Douglas. The case would become really com-
plicated if it was shown that Patrick had a
wife living when he escorted Alice to the
altar, so that his marriage with her was void,
and thus she would have been really married
to Douglas but for the fact that he had a
previous and surviving wife, unless, of course,
the previous wife had a previous husband
(say Alexander) also living. If she had,
and assuming that there was nothing wrong
with Alexander, which there probably would
be, it would apparently ensue that the wed-
ding of Florence and Douglas would be
THE MIRACLE.
“Well, now we’re both square, ain’t we!”
sound even if somewhat irregular. Much
uncertainty would be saved if. immediately
after marriage, a condensed record of the
event was indelibly inscribed on the small
of the back of each party; but there are
objections to this course, one being that the
fashionable TJ.S. lady’s back might become
overcrowded. History simply bulges with
matrimonial complications. To mention only
two: When Henry VIII.’s sixth widow mar-
ried her fourth husband (afterwards be-
headed) many unpleasant aspersions were
cast on him. Also the third husband of
Mary of Scotland was said to have two other
wives living besides the one from whom
he had got a doubtfully legal divorce; but
then he was always a suspicious character.

“Wancliai”: Narrow escapes? During
the early hours of a summer morning a fire
started in the outbuildings of a Gippsland
hotel. The brigade was soon on the scene,
and while the majority were attacking the
main conflagration one youthful fire-fighter
was instructed by the captain to
hose an adjoining tenement wdiieli
was in obvious peril. To do his
job the better he mounted a wooden
case, and with flames dancing pic-
turesquely around him played a
stream of water on all danger
patches. Several times his pedestal
caught, but he combated this men-
ace with occasional downward
swishes of the hose. A post-blazem
examination revealed that the
wooden case on which the young-
fireman had stood contained four
tins of benzine!

“Mei” : It’s a poor bigamist who
can’t find some plausible excuse (B.
S/9/’27 t ). But sometimes he over-
does it. Before a Sydney Judge
some years ago a steward from a
coastal steamer pleaded guilty to
the charge of having married a
widow in the Harbor City while he
had a wife and six children beside
the Yarra’s banks. His excuse was
that the lady, a masterful person
to whom, in the course of his
duties, he had been attentive on
the voyage up, had invited him to
her home, where lie had found a
table set for a wedding feast and a
clergyman in attendance. Nor was
this all. “Her two brothers were
there, too,” the Court was informed
—.“both policemen and both over six feet.”
His Honor declined to be impressed by the
moving tale and sentenced the transgressor
to 18 months’ imprisonment.

“J.H.T.”: Touching these recent para-
graphs about the “Clark Millions.” Some
time ago I wrote to the Mayor of Butte,
Montana, where the soil seems so favorable
to the growth of millionaires. I append his
reply:—
Office of Mayor, Butte, Montana,
August 11, 1927.
Dear Sir, —Replying to your letter of recent date,
I beg leave to advise you that all of Air. Clark's
children are living and shared in his estate. This

Beadle.

a tall brown jug, and planked it down on
the counter witli the demand, “Fill her up

jshment, but he obliged, and waited for the

of his threadbare garments, the sparrer mur-
mured something about “leavin’ the dough

Lung s only reply was to invert the jug, and

“Mugwumpian”: You can’t die in Mug-
wump, S.A., under 70 without exciting a
good deal of comment. There was something
like consternation when Johnny Squires
passed out suddenly at 68 and a bit. His
memorial service filled the chapel to over-
flowing, and afterwards the congregation
stood in little groups discussing the departed.
“Cut off in his prime,” murmured old Daniel
Griffen lugubriously. “Aye,” echoed Andrew
Sprightly, who is rising 90. “It’s sad to
see the boys being taken like this.”

“Alw.vn”: The site of what is now the
military reserve at George’s Head, Sydney,
represents the first grant of land made to
the original owners of the country by those
who had dispossessed them. It w r as known
as Warringal, and there, in 1815, 16 bucks
with their gins and families settled down
to “live like white pfella” under the leader-
ship of one Bungabee, a benevolent Govern-
ment supplying clothes, agricultural imple-
ments and seed. But the scheme did not
prosper, the grantees displaying about as
much inclination for toil as the remnants
of their race now domiciled at the expense of
the N-.S.W. Government at La Perouse.
“P.M.”: A Digger friend of mine still
tells how. when he moved into bis newly-
built War-Service home, he tied his dog, a
big retriever, to the corner block while lie
helped unload the furniture-van. The dog
became interested in a passing cat, and in
liis struggles to free himself brought down 20
feet of the wall with him. “Serve you
right,” said the contractor to whom he com-
plained. “you shouldn’t have moved in till
the wallpaper was dry. How do you expect
the walls to stick together wets’”

“Hoki Mut”: I heard of King Edward’s
death in circumstances somewhat similar to
those mentioned by “Ah Kee” (B. 15/8/’27),
but it ivas at Durban, S. Africa. During
March of that year I had joined the Pericles
on the return trip of her maiden voyage
which finished on the Leeuwin shoal. A life-
boat landing near the lighthouse, a six-mile
tramp to Flinders Bay. and a “Channel cross-
ing” on the Monaro followed. The Monaro
was in light trim with accommodation for
twelve passengers, and it had a temporary
complement of 590; the weather was such
that the 12,000-ton Otranto had ventilators
and bridge stanchions carried away in her
trip to Fremantle immediately behind us.
An excursion to Durban in the Wakool came
next: tearing headwinds the whole way. a
serious shortage of coal, and burning wattle-
bark for the last five days of a twenty-five
day trip—it usually lasts 12 days. Then
we saw the Durban pilot “boys” wearing
black bands on their naked arms. Yes, I
remember the death of Edward VII.!

“Ngaboni”: An anthropologist from the
Rockefeller (U.S.) foundation is getting a
lot of publicity for his researches into the
customs of Australian aboriginals. Writing
from an “unnamed district 25 miles from
the Arafura Sea" he tells city-bred people of
the quaint ways of the untutored savage.
So far he has disclosed nothing that hasn't
appeared in the works of Spencer and Gillen
and of Basedow'. It is quite possible that lie
is doing good work as a collector for his
institution, but as a discoverer he ranks,
on present evidence, with Terry of motor-trek
fame. As for his unnamed district, it has
been traversed by at least three British
survey parties, and, there is some reason to
believe, a Japanese one as well.

“Goldilocks”: An invalid Digger started
the new occupation—now
of car-attendant in Sydney. Out of a billet,
and unable to tackle heavy work, he decided
to make a job for himself, and learned that
motorists who parked their cars in Castle-
rcagh-street were eager to pay a fee for
security. Other men, finding new pitches,
have followed his example; and the attend-
ants have grown so numerous that the Auto-
mobile Club wants some legal registration
for the men, in order to ensure their honesty.
Failing to move the police or civic authori-
ties, it has issued uniforms and badges to
authorised attendants; but some of the men
who have been left out have closely copied
the uniforms. Probably the motorists will
in the future obtain the reasonable protection
they require; in any case, the man who
started the whole business deserves a word
for his enterprise.

“Sartor” : Murphy, our local constable, is a
thoroughly conscientious officer with a large
red proboscis, tomato-colored hair, freckles
as large as threepenny-bits and a touch of
ectropia about the lower eyelids. Altogether
his is a face that once seen is never likely to
be forgotten. At the annual races I noted
him standing near the grandstand gate. He
had discarded his uniform, but his plain
clothes made him just as conspicuous, for he
wore a coat that might have been looted
from a scarecrow, while his bat was a cross
between a candle-extinguisher and a diving-
bell. A bunch of us strode through the gate
and Blenkins remarked, with a gracious nod.
“Good-day. Murphy.” “Hush,” said the
sleuth. “Don't shpake to me. I’m dish-
guised !”
MILADY SHOPS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Arbitration Court Judge Drake-Brockman said
that he had made inquiries in Sydney about the price
of women’s hats, and found it varied in different streets
from 4s. lid. to £2 25., the article being precisely
the same. His Honor also said that he had read that
it took as much skill to c-ut a man’s hair as to cut
a woman’s hair, yet the woman was charged twice
as much.”
O lady, lady, can it be
That thus they trade who trade with thee?
Alert modiste and milliner
And eke the merchant shrewd of fur,
No less than he, with scented stocks,
Who deals devoutly with tliy locks,
The wight who craves the single boon
Of shaping thee thy tiny shoon,
And he who solely understands
The fitting habit of thine hands—
Do all with something to suffice
Thy dainty wants, charge twice the price,
Or five- or ten-fold that they can
Expect to wring from simple man?
Oh, lady, lady, what a fee
They claim who sell thee —vanity!
O lady, lady, bear with me,
Who stand amazed at mystery
Beyond the power to explain
Of any male, untutored brain!
Why at one corner should you grudge,
Bobs for a lid (as says a Judge)
And yet serenely pay in pounds
Within the fashionable bounds?
Are hats, like folk, worth more or less
Simply because of their address?
Lo, I, who face the sequent bill,
One savage wish I cherish still:
That shops, milady, there might be
Would 5e11... .a little sense. . . .to thee !

Heavy forward buying followed by a sharp
drop in the price of rubber ate deeply into
the year’s net earnings. However, a better
trading year in manufactured goods absorbed
part of the recoil from the raw market and
the .back-slide in gross profits (£546,763) was
only £38,300, but £81,814 was added to exes.
(£414,301) and between the lot net profit
shrank to nearly half the 1926 figure.
Whether the £132,462 of profits claimed have
been earned depends upon stocks having been
written back sufficiently; only the future
can decide that definitely. After deducting
the pref. requirements—they call for £52,000
p.a.—the balance of the year’s net earnings
was only 5.4 p.c. on the average ordinary
capital compared with 14.9, 14.1, 6.7 and
6.4 p.c. back to 1923. The final div. was
cut back to 2\ p.c., thus making p.e
for the year, and even then reserves had to
be dipped into to pay it. So far the co.
lias been very fortunate in escaping serious
damage from falling markets, laist year's
error —the management counted on the
Stevenson scheme becoming effective—is
not likely to be repeated.
Paid capital, which is to make another
leap forward, has grown in this way since
llie beginning of the century:—■

Since the books were ruled off the board
sold a half-million £1 ords. at 255. each to
the English Dunlop Co., which also has a
four-years option over a further half-
million shares at 305.; and a subsidiary,
jointly owned, is to be formed in Maoriland.
The deal should strengthen the trade posi-
tion of the Australian co., which will not
only secure ample funds for development,
but will gain the use of valuable trade
secrets and processes. Henceforth divs. will
have to be earned for a much bigger capital,
which, owing to the bonus issues of the
past, has not a very substantial prop in
the £139,590 of reserves, described as nominal
in the table because they are subject to
goodwill (£180.000). However, the co. has
a very able management and shareholders
have had a rich time in the past. The sale of
the first half-million shares will bring in
£125,000 of premiums; it will also make
paid capital £2,470,655, and an all-round
10 p.c. distribution will then call for actually
£SSCO-odd less than was netted in 1926.
The co.’s expanding trade is reflected in
this comparison of balance-sheet figures:—

The debt was more than doubled, and then
only Bs. Bd. of outside money was at risk
in the business for every £1 owned by share-
holders. During the year freeholds were
bought in Maoriland—Auckland, Welling-
ton and Christchurch —and at Adelaide and
Melbourne, extensions were made to the
plant and book debts grew, but most of the
new money went into stocks, on which
£231,230 more was spent than was written
off. They are heavier than they have been
for the last six years and a great deal de-
pends upon their valuation. Subject to that
the co. is well equipped to earn' better pro-
fits, but competition threatens to be keener;
money is tight with no immediate sign of
easier conditions, and any marked increase
in the demand from tyre-users within the
next few years is contingent to some extent
on good seasons and free spending. The
shoe factory, operated by a subsidiary in
which Dunlops merged their interests witli
those of the Dunlop-North British Rubber
Shoe Co. a couple of years back, is making
rapid progress. The demand exceeded the
output last year.
The deal with the English co. disappointed
the market, which had anticipated a new
share issue and paid 325. 6d. for the ords.
in July. The relapse from former pros-
perity also had its effect, and recent sales
were at 265. At that figure the return is
5.8 p.c. on a 71 p.c. div. basis, or 7.7 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. distribution. There is little busi-
ness in tbe well-protected profs., whose posi-
tion will be greatly strengthened when the
new capital is in.

Maoriland’s adverse trade balance is reflected
in the decreased profit, which is just suffi-
cient this year to enable the usual 14 p.c.
dividend to be paid ou the enlarged capital
—-the transfer to reserve is merely the small
increase in carry-over. The Post Office
►Savings Bank, building societies, agency and
co-operative societies, which offer better rates
to depositors than the big trading banks like
to pay, cut into regular banking business
rather deeply, especially in times of depres-
sion, and deposit rates have been increased
in consequence. While wool prices and out-
put have been fairly satisfactory, there has
been a bad slump in dairy-produce prices,
Argentine competition has been affecting the
meat-export trade, and mortgagees have been
left with a great many farms on their hands.
Imports have been reduced—largely as a
result of pressure brought to bear by the
banks —but export prices have continued to
fall. It is the same story as that of the
previous year with unimportant variations.
However, the surplus of M.L. imports lias
been reduced from 4J millions to 24 millions,
and prospects are brighter than they were'
last year. Public and private borrowing is
still heavy according to M.L. notions, but
the indebtedness is not on a scale that would
occasion much anxiety on the other side of
the Tasman Sea. Land prices have reached
something like stability; the banks have got
the importing business well in hand, and
National’s chairman, Pember Reeves, who
renewed his acquaintance with the Shivery
Isles a year or so ago, was able to speak
cheerily to the shareholders in London.
Balance-sheet figures show no very signifi-
cant variation :

The increased deposit rates have had their
designed effect, and ground lost in this direc-
tion in recent years has been regained. A
very modest increase in advances enables the
bank to show a balance on the side of de-
positors again. The slight increase in liquid
assets strengthens the position of a bank that
has for many years maintained its resources
at a much higher level than most of its
creditors would have been contented with.
Close on 50 per cent, of the bank’s liabilities
are backed by liquids in addition to
which there are undisclosed reserves and
£4,000,000 of share capital uncalled. A
difficult year has been got through without
any outward indications of discomfort, and
shareholders have no need to pipe the eye.
Scrip prices are steady at last year’s valua-
tion, £6 16s. per nominal 505.. which gives
the investor a return of £5 3s. 2d. per cent —
above the average for banks as long estab-
lished and as well guided as the National is.

Turnover (£4,697,135, up £637,539 ou the
year) was a record. Gross profit (£153,933)
sprang £19,958, net profit getting more than
half of the increase, and for the eighth
time in the last nine years bonus scrip
was handed out. The proportion was one
for every 16 shares held compared with one
for 11 in the previous year. Also £lO,OOO
was put by to meet last year’s income-tax
when the bill arrives—previously each year’s
assessment has been paid out of the follow-
ing year’s income. That left £5141 for re-
serves, making them 34.7 p.c. of paid capital
compared with 36.6, 39.4, 43.2 and 45.4 p.c.
hack to 1923; thus the support for capital
diminishes with each gift. Net profits last
year were exceptional; they were 22.5 p.c.
of paid capital compared with 19.8, 20.5,
22.7 and 24.7 p.c. for the four preceding
years. The figures suggest that the time
is approaching when gift-giving will cease
to be an annual event. Also the long run
of good seasons, which has meant fat returns
to cos. in the pastoral and produce business
must break sooner or later. A hint as to
what can happen is seen in the 1921 figures
But the market discounts the future and
pays 425., equal to 40s. Bd. ex bonus, for the
scrip—-say 40s. That means a return of 5
p.e. Paid capital is £255,000 in £1 shares,
including the last bonus addition, and there
will have to he three more gift issues of
15.000 shares and one of 6000 to make the
scrip worth its present price to the investor
who looks for only a 6 p.c. return.
The co.’s position is very snug, as this
comparison of balnnce-shooot figures show: —

Paid capital has advanced from £55,000
in 1907 to its present figures by the transfer
of surplus profits. The co. docs little in
the way of pastoral finance. Prosperous
conditions last year enabled clients to
repay £28.336 of their debt, and the over-
draft was wiped out. The amount at fixed
deposit v(£150.000) is out of the ordinary,
and the earning power of funds is slowed
down thereby, un the other hand it places
the co. in a strong position to win now
clients and hold old ones in difficult times.

1925, there was an unexpectedly heavy bill
to be met. Also the account for workers
compensation insurance came along, and
some provision was possibly made in advance
to meet the cost of child endowment.
But however this may be the reserve for
taxation (not included in the figures quoted
above) lias dropped from £3119 at December,
1926, to £2065, so that total reserves show
a decline from £7584 to £6271. In the
circumstances it might have been better to
reduce the dividend to a point at which it
would not have been necesssary to eat into
reserves of any sort. They are none too
large. Chairman Ludowici makes his usual
remarks about the harassing export regu
lations. Despite this trouble and the un-
settled condition of China, where much ot
the business lies, there is a good demand
for the company’s wares.
Balance-sheet figures compare:—
June, June, June, June, June,
1923. 1924. 1925. 1926. 1927.

Cash .. .. 771 3,122 636 475 3,038
The principal movement during the year
was a decrease of £7066 in stocks; but the
debt was reduced and the cash holding
strengthened. Thus there was little altera-
tion in the more or less liquid surplus
(£48,507). Paid capital is £100,963 in £1
shares, which have a net tangible backing
of 20s. lOd. each. On the market they are
worth 19s. or thereabouts, thus showing the
investor a return of 8.4 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div.
basis.

Alterations to the brewery, now complete,
interfered with operations during the year
and the Tasmanian Brewery Pty., Ltd. paid
only a small div. on its ord. shares. Tito
visible result is a precipitous drop (£9530)
in net earnings, which arc less than half the
average of the preceding five years. Cross
profit was £27,938, compared with £36.350,
£43,918, £38.306 and £40,217 back to 1923.
The board, however, does not complain that
there is anything wrong with business. On the
other hand, 10 p.c. was distributed; the re-
serves were dipped into —it is the first time in
over 27 years—for £3922 to do it. And that
in the face of competition from the new semi-
co-operative concern whose . brew has just
arrived on the market. Cascade’s holding in
the Pty. co. stands in the books at £101.284
-—written down £15,800 in the last five years
—about half of it in 8, p.c. profs., worth
£4o€o-odd per annum in divs. That is to say.
that other interests, among them £223,972
in “freehold properties, including Cascade
estate, hotels, water-rights, Cascade brew-
ery, etc., and premises,” brought in about
4 p.c. net on the balance of shareholders’
funds last year.
This comparison of balance-sheet figures
reflects the year’s activity:-

totalling £126,628, including the debenture
debt (£33,235) and mortgages (£13.890).
The board had gone to its bankers for
£53,000-odd and lent the money to the Pty.
eo. to buy a new Nathan brewing plant.
The loan is to be repaid at intervals, and
the liquid position should benefit. The new
brew, by the way, is expected to bo handed
over the counter this month. To ease the
position 50,000 new 21s. shares, called to
20s. each, were issued shoi'tl.v before the
books were ruled off. When all the money
is in paid capital will be £200,000, and a
10 p.c. div. will call for a shade less than
the average net profit during the last five
years.
The board looks ahead with a smile.. But
the market is iustified in being sceptical—
it offers only 18s. 6d. for the scrip; a year
ago 255. 4d. was paid. At 18s. 6d. the return
is 10.8 p.c. as long as the 10 p.c. div. con-
tinues. and the backing amounts to 325. 6d.
in not tangibles, subject to any goodwill in
the Pty. co.

result of a cut of £2186 in exes, and a drop
of £684 in the amount set aside for deprecia-
tion. Income (£54,781) was £2681 less
than in the previous year, the first back-
slide since the co. took over the Grand and
its old neighbor, the White Hart, seven
years ago. Up to the close of the 1920
accounts most of the time and £89,722 was
spent on remodelling the combined pro-
perties. That, of course, interfered with
trade, and progress was slow, but with the
decks clear something substantial in the
way of improvement was looked for. How-
ever, the £8996 netted last year was equal
to only 5.9 p.c. of paid capital (£150,000),
compared with 5.8, 5.3, 3.4 and 2.4 p.c.
back to 1923. The 85,000 £1 8 p.c. cum.
prefs. call for £6BOO p.a.; arrears at June
30 totalled £14.450, equal to 17 p.c., and at
last year’s rate of distribution (10 p.c.) it
will take 84 years to clean the slate. Unless
earnings brighten considerably the prospect
of the ords. getting into the picture is a
very poor one. And the £6031 of capital
still represented by goodwill does not im-
prove the position.
Here are balance-sheet figures:—
1924. 1926. 1927.
Debentures .. .. £50,000 £50,000 £50,000
Mortgages . . . . 64,000 64,000 64,000

Cash, etc. .. .. 374 1,055 1,032
At June 30 there was 19s. 6d. of outside
money at risk in the business for every £1
owned by shareholders. The £26,366 owing
on open account —down £3241 owing to the
withdrawal of deposits—was £21,294 in
excess of the more or less liquids (£5072),
including stocks. Provision for depreciation
does not appear to have been neglected; the
£3547 written off during the year made the
total approximately 43 p.c. of the cost
(£42,115) of equipment, etc.
The market, however, looks at the debt
and the poor return on capital, and offers
only 18s. 6d. for the prefs. At that figure
the return is 8.6 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis;
the arrears amount to 3s. sd. per share,, and
the backing is 19s. 2d. in net tangibles.
There is little demand for the ords.

A reference in The Bulletin (29/9/’27)
to the possibility of sorhe of Sydney Siam's
new capital issue being used in connection
with gold leases in New Guinea has brought
a disclaimer frpm the co., which says it lias

The co. for which engineer Tom Horton
has been looking over the gold leases is
called Territory Investments, Ltd.

Optimism, exuded by the Minister for
Mines, the American drillers and the daily
press, lias hovered over the Ronia bore. So
iar there is very little that is new. A wet
gas has been found again, and for a time
it was wetter than before. This was em-
phasised by the drippings of gasoline, a new
feature for Roma and quite consistent with
the greater density of the gas of which it
is a natural distillate. The natural oil
couldn’t very well be of higher quality—
-9.1 per cent, consists of extremely volatile
hydrocarbons. There was some talk of
stopping at the gas and putting down an-
other bore. Assuming this wet gas is crown-
ing a dome, it will be necessary to go down
the sides of the dome and test the gas sand
at a lower level with a view of bringing in
oil, or to go on prospecting the sands
vertically below this bed in the present bore.
The latter proposal should not be neglected.
There are so many fields in U.S.A. that have
distinct and successive oil and gas horizons
in vertical sections of some thousands of
feet that the deeper country at Roma simply
cries out for testing. Roma developments,
coming hot on the heels of Dr. Woolnough’s
recently acquired optimism about the Queens-
land Central West basin, will probably result
in a period of intensive research and pros-
pecting.

A Melbourne shale-oil syndicate formed
by the Spence Bros., of Bendigo, has been
opening up an old mine at Reedy Creek,
three miles east of the old Joadja workings
(N.S.W.). It is reported that eight tons
of shale have been retorted for a yield of
60 gallons of oil a ton. The shale is said to
average 3ft. in width, and an oil-bearing coal
of similar thickness covers it. The syndi-
cate holds 1000 acres, and the estimate of
shale in sight is 4,500,000 tons, while coal
approximately of the same amount overlies
the shale. The question is, what can be done
with it? The withdrawal of John Fell from
the Wolgan Valley enterprise, in the same
State, is the worst blow the industry has
received for many years. The failure of the
Commonwealth Oil Corp. didn’t count for
half so much, for the extravagance of that
English concern would have ruined the Bank
of England.

Premier Collier (W.A.) has £166,000 plus
interest in keeping, received as a grant from
the Federal Government to help Westralian
gold mining. Collier says there is none of
this for the London cos. unless they first
put up fresh capital. London has the idea
that Collier should first expend the £166,000,
they to subscribe capital later; but Collier
cannot see it this way. As one of the main
objects in view is to keep Ivalgoorlie miners
employed, the Premier is finding the position
pretty complex. If he were to hand the
Federal grant over to the cos. it would meet
as tragic a fate as did the £50,000 which the
State advanced to the Golden Horseshoe last
year. If he does not thus hand over he
fears the cos. will close down their mines,
thus throwing thousands of men out of em-
ployment. The latter is the very thing Col-
lier wishes to avoid, as he cannot forget that
every miner has a vote. As a matter of
fact, though, many of the miners would not
he much concerned if the mines did close
down, as, in that event, the workings would
be thrown open to tributors, and this is
what a lot of the old hands really want. Inci-
dentally. no one seems to be offering the
numerous small investors in lower-grade
mines any cash to assist them to deviate
from the rough road to the Insolvency Court,
which they are at present on.

Following the State Mining Engineers
report on the Wiluna goldmines the West-
ralian Government has been tempted to
build a railway to the field. A bill authoris-
ing the construction of the line is expected
to be introduced in Parliament at an early
date. Already a fierce battle of routes has
begun. Geraldton and Murchison want the
railway extended from Meekatharra or Sand-
stone because they are nearest by about 60
miles to Wiluna. Ivalgoorlie and other east-
ern goldfields centres are clamoring for the
construction of the line from Leonora
because it would serve expanding pastoral
interests and be a handy asset to traders
iti that part of the State.
* * * *
Subject to a railway being built, negotia-
tions are proceeding in London for the
flotation of a co. with a capital of several
hundred thousand pounds to acquire a group
of Wiluna leases adjoining those held by the
Wiluna Gold Co. The early flotation of
other ventures with “prospects as good as
anything else on the field” are also talked of.
* * *
Amalgamations at Ivalgoorlie still hang
fire and the chances of an early fusion
do not appear hopeful. Latest London
advices are that most of those interested
agree that central power and treatment
plants plus better management would sub-
stantially cheapen costs, lengthen the life of
the mines and bring large tonnages of addi-
tional ore reserves within range of profitable
extraction; but no one seems energetic
enough to bring things to a head. Meanwhile
the State Government is considering further
concessions, including the abolition of the
div. tax.
* * * *
Westralian Mines Department is about to
do some diamond drilling on the old and
now almost paralysed Northampton lead-
field. The site selected for the first bore is
on the Surprise mine, Galena, where the
ore was high-grade down to 200 ft. and then
became too poor to work profitably. The
object is to see if the shoot has become
permanently impoverished at depth or
Whether only a poor zone has been en-
countered.
Guinea Gold, one of the earlier Bulolo
flotations, has received some details of the
valuation of the Guinea Gold South leases
from the co.’s field engineer. These show
400,000 c.y. at 55., 410,000 c.y. at 2s. 4d., and
2,000,000 yards or so yet to be tested. The
ground is easy * and when the proposed
draught road from the coast is finished the
treatment of 80,000 c.y. per month at a cost
of 9d. per yard is figured on. In addition
to the above area, about 450 acres, which are
expected to give good returns, have been
acquired and will be incorporated with the
G. G. South leases. Engineer T. Horton
says no elaborate elevating or sluicing
scheme will be necessary at the Kaili section
and that the methods in force at Koranga
Creek are quite correct. It is understood
that these leases were also being bored and
otherwise tested. If so, when is the verdict
likely to be announced?
The mother-lode at liavenwood (N.Q.),,
from which a couple of payable crushings
have been noted in the past few months, has
been purchased by a new co. Cheaper
working costs are talked about. The tunnel
now being put in will create backs that at
present have to be hauled through winze and
tunnel. If costs can be reduced sufficiently
this show, which is a big body of low-grade
stuff, shows promise.

Several boring plants operating in the
Mitchell River and Mounjt Spurgeon alluvial
tin leads, north of Mareeba ( N.Q.), have lately
attracted attention. Dr. Jensen and E. G.
Theodore are interested. Diggers have made
a living in this area for decades. Their
figures are not always too reliable, but 41b.
of black tin to the dish on several occasions
is legend around the gullies of Mount Spur-
geon. Most of the N.Q. areas are sluicing
propositions true - alluvia#— and-- deeply-
weathered granite porphyry and talus. The
price right and there is an abundance of
cheap water.

The former Austral Malay holdings in the
Pungah Valley, oiam, known as Klong Rah
and Pungah, which were disposed of to an
English co., Kamunting Tin Dredging, Ltd.,
last July, have now been taken over by a new
co., Pangnga River Tin Concessions, Ltd., in-
corporated in England, with practically the
same directorate as Kamunting. Kamunting
got no profit from the transfer, though share-
holders making application were to receive
special consideration on allotment. As the
English subscription list closed on July 25,
there could have been little chance for Aus-
tralian holders in Kamunting to get in. The
combined properties comprise 715 acres.
Pangnga. with a depth of 294 ft., is estimated
to contain 21,000 000 c.y., going 1.021 b. 1 o
the yard. Klong Rah is sized up as holding
13,000,000 yards averaging .641 b. Two
electrically-operated dredges, each of 150,000
c.y. per month capacity, are to tackle the
job. R. L. Naish, general manager of
Kamunting, has reported on the property
and thinks much of it, especially Pangnga.
The new co.'s capital is £300,0u0 in 1,200,000
shares of ss. each, of which 163,336 went in
part payment for the properties, and
1,036,664 were offered for subscription. Kam.
has agreed to provide any additional work-
ing capital necessary up to £30,000. Austral
Malay, which paid £25,000 for the property
originally, received £35,000 for the sale,
£17,500 in cash and £17,500 in f.p. shares
in the new Pangnga River Tin Concessions.

Chang Phra Tin, which has been heard of
in the quotations lately, was the ewe lamb
of Austral Siamese Tin Exploration, of Mel-
bourne, which went into liquidation after
the birth of its infant in September, 1926.
A new co.. Austral Siamese, was formed at
the same time to take over the original hold-
ing co.’s assets. Shares in the new co. were
allotted to holders in the old, two new shares
for one in the old, issued as paid up to 2s.
Capital of Austral Siamese is £lOO,OOO in £1
shares. Issued capital was 92,600 shares
paid up to 2s. Shares held in reserve, 7400.
Chang Plira's capital is £120,000 in £1
shares. Of these 23,150 have been issued as
f.p., 7400 as 10 p.c. cum. participating pref.
shares paid up to £1 each and 69,450 con-
tribs paid to 2s. 6d. each —the pref. shares
were issued to the chairman of directors of all
the abovementioned cos., A. W. Palfreyman,
for underwriting the Chang Phra contribu-
ting issue. This is the stock which wakened
to life in Sydney last week, a sale at 2s.
104 d. being reported. Chang Phra’s hold-
ing is 240 acres in Siam. J. O. Minto, the
boring engineer, estimates that 100 acres,
to a depth of 21 feet, go 19oz. tin oxide,
while quantity of proved ground to be
treated is 3,872,000 c.y., “good dredging
material’’ free of timber and large stones.
Some talk has been heard of a bucket-dredge
equipment for the property, and there it
stops, as far as the public is concerned. Con-
sidering the comparatively small acreage,
shallow ground, and small area actually
tested to date, it doesn’t seem that the pre-
mium of 4|d. on those 2s. 6d. contribs is
altogether justified.

Details follow of the adoption of Nai
Hoot, the latest bairn of Malay Siamese.
The co. has a three, months’ option, and is
to pay immediate liabilities amounting to
£B9OO and others as incurred, and will
keep the mine operating efficiently. Also,
it will pay Nai Hoot’s expenses to com-
pletion of liquidation; and Nai Hoot will

Thabawleik, one of Austral Malay's numer-
ous offspring and the first Australian dredg-
ing co. to set in in Southern Burma, has
declared its first interim div. of 2s. per
share, payable Oct. 21. The co. started well
in debt to the parent, and the dredge, a
plant of 100,000 c.y. per month, did not
commence digging until November, 1926.
The property, as Austral Malay tried it out,
contained 16,400,000 c.y., 1.461 b. of t.o. to
the yard, and I,Boo,oooyds. were assessed
at 0.621 b. to the yard. Reboring showed 21b.
to the yard in the richer ground. Water
supply lias been a trouble, but this is being
overcome. In spite of preliminary hitches
the dredge has been making good recoveries
from the beginning, thus enabling the co. to
repay much of its debt, and recent returns
indicate that the estimates will be largely
exceeded if the present average keeps up.
Working only 377 hours in Se ptember the
return w T as 60 tons from 76,000yd5., as
against 70 tons from 86,000.vd5. in August.
Production realised £11,500 and working
costs were £2950, or 9d. per c.y., the average
recovery being 1.761 b. per yard.
:i: * =•= *
Kampong Kamunting, Austral Malay’s
14-year-old show-, had auotlier good month,
the two dredges turning over 128,000yds. for
56 tons, an average of .981 b. per yard, and
almost level pegging with the previous
month’s return of 57 tons. Asam Kumbang,
with 25 tons from 104,000yd5., was well be-
low the August output of 30 tons, and the
yardage average was only .541 b. as against
.781 b., though nearly 20.000yds. more ground
was turned over. TJlu Yam did not do
well with 11 tons from 61,000yd5., though
the dredge was only at work for the last
half of the month, owing to renewals. The
average was lower, too, being .401 b. to the
yard, while August figures were 36 tons and
average per yard .84lb.
* * * *
The Malay Siamese group got a handsome
return from Pliin Soon, their open-cast show
in the Kinta district. Last month's re-
sults were 25.3 tons from 30,000 c.y.; a trifle
over 21b. of t.o. to the c.y. The new pilot
plant should be making trial runs early this
month, and when the additional electrical
plant is finished by the end of October, it
is hoped to run the mine full time—about
700 hours per month. The September spin
was only 352 hours.
* * * *
Nawng Pet, another of the Malay-Siamese
subsidiaries, is a sluicing show, but hydro-
electric plant is being installed and the job
should be finished in six months’ time, when
a greatly increased output is expected. This
show returned 19.8 tons from 29,706 yards
for September, which is a trifle better than
the August figures.

PURPOSE OF THE ISSUE.— These Debentures are being issued for the purpose of providing further finance for the construction
of the Ocean Promenade Pier at Coogee, N.S.W., work on which is now very considerably advanced.
PARTICULARS OF THE ISSUE.— The issue is made on the following general terms:—
(1) The period will be five or ten years, from Ist January, 1928, at the subscriber’s option,
and interest 9 per cent, on face value payable half-yearly on presentation of coupons
attached to debentures.
(2) A Debenture-holder may convert the whole or any number of his debentures to fully-paid
ordinary shares par for par at any time before 31st December, 1932.
(3) Debentures will be redeemed at a premium of 2J per cent, on face value.
(4) Debentures will be “to Bearer” with the right for the Holder to demand registration at
any time.
METHOD OF PAYMENT.— Debentures may be paid for in full
on application, or as to 25 per cent, on application and 25 per cent,
on the fifteenth day of each of the three months following the month
in which allotment is made. Debenture-holders paying by instalments
may complete payment at any time without waiting for the due dates.
ASSETS CHARGED BY THIS ISSUE.
The Debentures hereby created are to be secured by a Trust Deed,
with a Trustee or Trustees for the Debenture-holders to be appointed by
them, and are to be a charge on the whole assets of the Company, both
present and future, which on Ist August, 192 7, comprised the following:
Pier Construction
Plant and Sundries . .
Unpaid Capital, exceeding
Lease from Randwick Council purchased from
Vendor Company for cash and shares
totalling
£38,500
3,500
27,500
25,000
Total
£94,500
TRUSTEES. —AII moneys paid for Debentures in the terms of this
issue are to be vested in Trustees, to be appointed by the Debenture-
holders. A draft of the Trust Deed may be inspected at the Office of
the Company or of its Solicitors. The Directors of the Company have
for the time being agreed to act as Trustees for the Debenture-holders.
THE LEASE. —The Company’s lease in comparison with similar
rights in England, where Piers pay dividends up to 30 per cent, per
annum, is a most valuable document, and gives very considerable
revenue-earning rights and concessions which are not open to English
Companies.
The Company has already let its Pier-head Ballroom to Mr. J. C.
Bendrodt, whose reputation in dance organisation and management is
of the highest, at a rental of over £3OOO for the first year after com-
pletion of the Pier, and with a renewal option for a further period of up
to four years at over £4500 per annum.
The Company has been offered over £2OOO per annum for a ten-
year lease of its eight small shops. This offer has not been accepted, as
it is considered that considerably higher rentals will be obtained.
The Debenture interest of £4500 per annum would be more than
secured during their currency by these two leases alone, without drawin
on the rentals of the Restaurant, Theatre, Advertising Spaces, or on th
Automatic Machine rights or Pier Tolls, which last alone are conserva-
tively estimated in the Company’s share prospectus to amount to £65,625
per annum.
<t> JQ
The lease to Mr. J. C. Bendrodt and the offer for the shops may
be inspected at the Company’s Office.
THE PIER. —The Pier now extends over. 600 feet from the sea-
wall, and will ultimately be 936 feet long, providing a broad Promenade
terminating in a large Pier Head with Theatre, Restaurant, Ballroom, etc.
The structure was subjected in April, 1927, to the full force of one of
the strongest gales ever experienced on the coast of New South Wales.
The wind velocity at Coogee was over 74 miles per hour, and a very
heavy sea was running. In spite of its unfinished and unbraced con-
dition, this cyclone failed to set up a quiver in the structure, and abso-
lutely no damage was done. This experience confirms that of other
countries where the same method of construction is used.
Any person interested herein may obtain from the
Company’s Office a pass which will secure him per-
mission to inspect the Pier.
SINKING FUND. —Due provision is being made for a Sinking
Fund for redemption of Debentures.
The Sinking Fund will be handed over as available to Trustees, to
be appointed by the Debenture-holders, to be invested or otherwise dealt
with by them as permitted by the Trustee Act in force in New South
Wales, and with the right for the Trustee or Trustees to lend the Sinking
Fund to the Company against approved security, and to use it for the
purchase of Debentures of this issue, either on the market or privately.
STOCK EXCHANGE. —Application will be made in due course
to have the Company’s Debentures listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange.

The re-union of Parliamentarians at
Canberra last week was marked by a
spirit of cheeriness; even the handclasp
between Bruce and Theodore smacked
of social amity. A rather boisterous atmo
sphere only sobered into gravity when the
party leaders called attention to the
absence of a long-familiar face —one that
had seen many others in and out of the
Chamber. In the place of Walter Gale, who
had died since Parliament last assembled,
was J. R. McGregor, as Clerk of the House.
Even as ex-Speaker Johnson was giving forth
his eulogy of the man who was gone,
McGregor crumpled pitifully. The new
Clerk was borne away dying before the
House had officially expressed its regret at
the passing of the old.
J. L. Purves, leader of Vic. Bar in his
day, had plenty of initiative. One scorching
afternoon li e was panting for a reviver. But
he was on a big case, and his junior was
detained in another court and could not
respond to Purves’s urgent messages.
Purves was getting irritable, and Thomas
a’Beckett, who was on the bench, was watch-
ing him with amusement. However, thirst
triumphed. Addressing ’Sonah, Purves said
that he would have to ask that the Court be
adjourned for a few minutes to enable him
to interview a most important witness.
Looking more surprised perhaps than he felt
a’Beckett said that the application was
unusual. Would the interview shorten the
case and could J.L. give the Court the
name of the witness? “The witness,” replied
Purves boldly, “is a party of the name of
Walker, and I am certain that my contact
with him will shorten the case.” The Judge
left the bench for five minutes.
Representatives of three pioneers who
figure prominently in Australian history
were present when the Royal Historical
Society unveiled a tablet at Port Kemba
(N.S.W.) as a memorial of the occasion, 111
fears ago, when the original Port Ivembla
settlers received their grants of land. Sur-
veyor-General Oxley, who allocated the
grants, was represented by his grandson, H.
M. Oxley of Bowral; Miss Elizabeth Betts
was there to represent her parson grand-
father, Sam Marsden; and Miss Hume Bar-
ber, who was also present, is a descendent
of the explorer Hume.
James A. Robertson, whose death leaves
the job of herdmaster to the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture vacant, took to pastoral
science as a duck takes to water. He was
only 12 years old when he conducted the milk
and cream tests for the Jersey milk conden-
sing on the Coolangatta estate of John
Hay. After an apprenticeship he went to
Scotland, and among the prizes he carried off
while student at the Royal Veterinary Col-
lege of Edinburgh was the William Memorial
Prize, which is open for competition to all
the British veterinary schools. Preferring
to return to Australia to taking an instruc-
tor’s job in Scotland, he got the position
14 years ago from which his death removed
him, far too early, at 41.
There were 77 other applicants for the
job of manager of Vic. Parliamentary
refreshment-rooms. The winner began as
kitchen-boy in the branch 20 years ago, and
seven years ago was made chef. Of eight
who went to the ballot six were ex-publi-
cans and ex-managers and present sub-mana-
gers of big caravanserais. The chef of Pent-
ridge, who was an applicant, impressed the
House Committee with the fact that a bloke
who could feed prisoners well was more
than a gastronomical match for Parliamen-
tarians. Anyway the manager hasn’t to
make the room pay—the Treasury makes
good the annual loss from the people's
money.
The veteran coach-owner Tom Newman,
one of a large family of that name who
were connected with Maoriland mail-car
routes, was among the Fernlanders at
Sydney Spring Carnival The man who
drove good horses for many years has a
shrewd eye for a thoroughbred; he owns
Lady Desmond and others. Though the
motor at first did not appeal to him.
Newman eventually went into the business
with the same energy that he put into
pioneering with the horse-drawn coaches in
the years ago.
Forty years ago T. A. Graham was with
the Pacific Mail Company, which ran the
steamer line between Sydney and San
Francisco. In those days the Southern
Pacific Railway had an Australian repre-
sentative, but after a time the office was
closed and the agency work handed over to
the shipping companies. Graham, selected
on the eve of his retirement at 63 to spy
out the land for a new appointment for the
S.P. and associated lines, died within a week
of landing.
Victoria is now dotted with cairns marking
the track of Hume and Hovell from the
Murray to Corio Bay. Angus McMillan,
pioneer explorer of Gippsland, has been
commemorated in a similar fashion. The
man chiefly responsible for these permanent
reminders of our early explorers is C. R.
Long, late of the Vic. Education Dept., and
author of several books on Australian history.
Long has unbounded energy for his good
Australian purpose and an enthusiasm that
wins the co-operation of the country resident.
JUSTICE SIM
William Alexander Sim took to the law
just as soon as Otago Uni. would let him,
and was advising clients in the office of
Stout, later C.J., the day after he quali-
fied for a vote. After 21 years in associa-
tion with Stout he became a Judge of the
Arbitration Court and held the job for
seven years, after which he was translated to
the Supreme Court Bench. Sim has never
been known to smile on the Bench. In the
Industrial Court he was held in esteem
by both sides—he had a genius for the job.
He’ll pass his seventieth milestone in a few
months. A knighthood came his way three
years ago.
Crimean veterans are made of stuff to
turn the Reaper’s blade. At Wanganui
(M.L.) Thomas Skelly has notched his 96th
birthday. He was a private in the 25th
Bengals and put in a winter in the trenches
below Sebastopol; spent a while, too, in the
hospital at Scutari and his memory of
Florence Nightingale is vivid still. He
arrived in Maoriland in time to have a shot
at brown brother ilori when he hit the war
trail in the Wanganui district.
Monsignor Barry Doyle, the R.C. preacher
who is lecturing on behalf of starving child-
ren in the “Near East” can claim a record so
far as war .chaplains are concerned. He
was a British army padre during the
World War and saw service in France, Bel-
gium, Poland, Russia, Egypt, Palestine,
Mesopotamia, East and West Africa,
Salonika and Turkey. It is doubtful whether
any other saw service on so many battle-
fronts.
When the report of the Chief Inspector
of Factories was laid on the fable of Vic.
Assembly the other afternoon Alec Peacock,
looking bored on the front Opposition bench,
aroused himself. His eyes lit on a spof
above the Speaker’s chair to which he used
to look for inspiration in the years before
Federation when, as Minister and private
member, he was fighting for wages boards
legislation. It was an uphill battle, but he
won. In those days Peacock required few
notes to state his case. But if he halted he
turned his eyes to the canopy above the
Speaker’s chair for inspiration. The only
witnesses of' those struggles who still re-
main in the House are Downward, Bowser,
Prendergast, Toutcher and Lawson ; and, of
course, the assistant-clerk of the House,
Barstow.
Truby King, the energetic little Maori-
land medico whose theories on babies are
accepted throughout the world, although
close on 70, wants to travel about a bit
before the Reaper gets a clear cut at him.
Born in New Plymouth (M.L.) he graduated
at Edinburgh Uniyersity at 24, with the
highest honors of his year. For several years
he was medical superintendent at Wellington
and, later, Seacliff mental hospitals. King’s
discoveries are set forth in one of the most
valuable and worst sub-edited books the
world has ever seen. Two years ago George
Windsor handed him a knighthood.
Victoria has been unlucky with its pen-
sioners. Hartley Williams’s £36,000 in 24
years is less than Charles Gavau Duffy’s rec-
ord ; he drew £lOOO a year for 40 years—
merely for being Premier. Hugh Eardley Cul-
ling Childers, as an ex-Minister of the
Crown, drew £lOOO a year in London, although
he became a Minister there under Gladstone
Andrew Clarke held ministerial office in
Vic. and drew £lOOO a year for life—for
three years’ work.
The oldest police pensioner in N.S.W.,
Hugh Abercrombie, sits in the sun at
Milson’s Point and, watching the bridge
steelwork stabbing the skies, recalls ihe
time when Sydney was a small town,
and catching stray goats -was part of
a policeman’s duty. It is 02 years since
he arrived in Australia. The N.S.W. police
were glad to get a man who had been four
years with the Irish constabulary. His most
exciting adventure was as huntsman of the
Parramatta River murderer. This fiend was
a forerunner of Butler; he lured young sea-
men to a lonely cottage, murdered them,
took their money and dumped their bodies,
weighted with stones, into the river. Aber-
crombie has been drawing his pension for
31 years.
Judge “Billy” Williams, of Vie. County
Court, who, when he bought his first judge’s
wig, remarked that the overhead charges of
the job were high, sees that; his court does
not get too dull. He is as bright on the
bench as he was in the Assembly when he
was member for St. Kilda. The other
morning a couple of members of the Bar
came in, made brief preliminary applications
and then turned to leave. “What! Going’! 1 "
queried ’Sonah. “Can’t you really stay for
a while? Things will be good to-day.”
Though few would glory in the fact, J. T.
Lang, who lately told a country audience
that he did not read books, is not the first
N.S.W. Premier to make the strange boast.
Another who would have dismissed as a fan-
tasy the suggestion that “Learning by study
must be won” was Jim McGowen. The
former boilermaker was holidaying at a
Blue Mountain boarding-house shortly after
taking office, and had as a fellow guest a
University professor. A new book was stir-
ring comment at the time, and the man of_
learning asked McGowen what he thought
of it. “I haven’t read it,” said Jim, and
added, “I never read books.” The scholar
expressed his amazement. “But where and
how do you get your ideas?” he said. The
statesman, looked gravely at him. “From the
papers and listening to blokes talkin’,” he
replied.
It is nearly a score of years since Pro-
fessor Archibald Leversidge ceased active
work at the University of Sydney, but a
lot of the foundations of education in
N.S.W. were laid by him. He joined the
staff of the Uni. in 1872, took the Chair of
Geology and Mineralogy two years later, and
in 1884 became Professor of Chemistry. He
remained in that chair until his retire-
ment ; but .he organised the Faculty of
Science in 1879 and the School of Mines in
1890. He was also one of the three original
members of the Board of the Technological
RANDOLPH BEDFORD, M.L.A., of
Queensland and the rest of Australia,
who is not helping Lang in N. S. Wales,
“where the Communists have had their
way.”
Museum, which was first quartered in a cor-
rugated-iron barn in the Domain in 1879,
and he was a member of the board which
introduced technical education. When he
passed out in London the other day he was
within reach of 80.
ON HIS OWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
•“While the Ministerial and Opposition parties were
holding their pre-sessional meetings at Canberra, ex-
Prime Minister Hughes, a forlorn little figure in
plus-fours, went round the golf course in lonely
state.”
Ah! William, a furrow stiff and lonely
’Tis yours to plough to-day, who ran the
show
With such intense 6clat, our one and only
War-winning statesman not so long ago,
Whose name and fame were boosted to the
sky
From Adaminaby to Beckham Rye.
And did you muse amid the Canberra
bunkers
On fleeting greatness and on Bruce and
Page,
That pair of startlingly presumptuous
younkers
Who queered your pitch and pushed yon
from the stage?
And filled with bitter thoughts did you
address
Your ball with somewhat extra viciousness?
Far o’er the seas another Cymric wizard
Faces an outlook ’most as bleak and blank,
11 is following so clipped and shorn and scis-
sored
'Twould hardly crowd a fair-sized char-a-
banc.
But yours? Upon the links, poor luckless
elf,
You hold a party meeting—by yourself.
Less tendency perhaps to sense a rival
In any colleague over-near your throne
Might have contributed to your survival.
If less regard for Number One you’d
shown,
William, you’d scarce be hitting golf-balls
clouts
Outside th.e pale alike of Ins and Outs.
Well, Fortune’s wheel may turn, there’s no
gainsaying,
I’m sceptical about it, all the same.
I wonder shall we ever see you playing
A more gregarious, congenial game,
Driving along the fairway, as of yore,
Brand-new enactments with a warning
“Fore!”
N.S.W.

“Pfella”: Black Jimmy was a Binghi who
had acquired a smattering of his white
brothers’ ways, and always preferred con-
tract to day-labor. The boss wanted the
garden fence repaired, and Jimmy’s tender
of fifteen shillings was accepted. But Tarpot
wasn’t prepared to soil his hands with
manual graft; he let the job to another
nigger for a pound. The boss pointed out
Jimmy’s bad business undertaking, but the
latter seemed quite satisfied to carry on.
“But you’re going to pay five shillings more
than I’m giving you,” the boss pointed out.
“Him orl right,” explained Jimmy; “him
worth five cliillins to be boss.”

“Jim Domino”: “Yairs,” said Jack Bell
the Condobolin (N.S.W.) teamster, telling
me the yarn, “ th’ old bloke was as deaf as
a beetle. As he sat carvin’ at a stick with
a pocket-knife, up rides a bloke on a horse.
‘How far’s it ter Condobolin?’ he says, not
knowin’ th’ old chap’s deaf. Wire-whiskers
looks up. ‘Yeah, it’s a nice day,’ he says.
‘l’m makin’ a w’ip-’andle.’ The bloke on the
nag looks at him fer a sec., then he says
again: ‘How far’s it ter Condobolin?’ ‘I
s pose so/ the old bloke mumbles. ‘l’ll
make a pretty long taper on it first, fer it
takes a lot .o’ cuttin’ down.’ The cove on
the prad b’ this time is gettin’ reel im-
patient. ‘Blast yer hide!’ he yells, ‘who
tli’ blazes wants ter know about yer whip-
’andle. As fur’s I’m concerned y’ c’n
shove th’ blanky thing down yer throat.’
He was beginnin’ ter ride off, w’en th’ old
chap chimes in: ‘Yeali....an’ w’en I gets
the taper down that fur’ (an’ he ran ’is
’and along tli’ stick two foot) ‘l’ll saw it
orf.’ ”
* * * =!:
“Wingella”: If “Outback” (B. 14/7/’27)
will come to the Territory I’ll introduce
him to trap-door spiders that never make
doors for their tunnels, but roll small stones
over the openings. One gravel-patch I know of
has about a dozen tunnels; it is amusing to
step on it and notice, suddenly, several large
pebbles, about the size of marrowfat peas,
start to roll along an inch or so, and then
drop over a spider’s house.
* * :|c :l:
“Te Babarantiko”: Someone has deceived
“Kayeff” (B. l/9/'27) about the village
virgins in the Gilbert Islands. They were
never “a feature throughout the Gilbert
group”; the isolated cases had no religious
significance; no tabu, powerful or other-
wise,-was ever laid on the immediate vicinity
of the hut; the maiden was not incarcerated
from infancy, neither was she under strict
guard. The bleaching process, as I observed
it, was the whim of some ambitious tina
(mother) or ibun (foster- or adopted-
mother) to enhance the young lady’s matri-
monial value. The segregation commenced
some months before puberty, and when per-
sisted in resulted in a temporary lightened
color. To take such a girl for a European
would require an exceptional imagination.
“E.S.S.” : Two days before we delivered a
mob of bullocks at Naryilco (Q.), a strange
accident provided a feast for a group of
blacks. A fine big bullock jumped a gully
about 3ft. wide, and when it landed its off
hind leg snapped like a carrot. We had to
shoot it, but all we took from it was some
rump steak. The rest was presented to the
blacks, who were camping near the gully.
While several attacked the carcase with their
knives and tomahawks, one cautious old
fellow asked the boss drover to give him a
receipt. “S’pose squatter come 'long, lie say
blackfeller kill um bullock belonga station,”
Jacky argued. “S’pose p’liceman come longa
camp, lie say, ‘Where you get all that meat?’
You gib it_ paper yabber, tell um all about
rhat blackfeller bin buy um dead bullock.”
THE WORRIES OF BUSINESS.
“Eh, Bill, how are we going to sell that big gold watch we pinched last Thursday?”
“Why, I thought you’d sold that to I key Flynn.”
“Yairs, but I lifted it again from the cove that bought it from Ikey.”
So the trouble-saving document was written :
“This is to certify that I have sold one dead
bullock to .Tacky Pipeclay and party.
(Signed) J. Davidson, Drover.”
“Sea Nomad” : Bough weather on portions
of the Barrier has been stirring up the
sea-snakes. For some unknown reason they
come up only on certain areas of the ocean,
perhaps above a favorite feeding-ground
whose weedy depths have been obscured by
disturbed silt. In some parts the shakes can
be counted from the masthead by the score.
Their presence is, as a rule, a good indica-
tion of shell bottom, since their food lies
upon those areas of ground where pearl
shell generally thrives. Many of the Torres
Islanders will not kill a sea-snake because it
is one of their chief totems. I’ve seen a
wriggler hooked on the towline, and the
hoys go to much trouble to unhook the brute
without hurting it—in a rough sea, too.
* * * *
“Gouger”: Some pearl shells are complete
sea-gardens in miniature. A few in the
possession of schoolmaster Miller, of Darnley
Island (N.Q.), support dinkum forests.
Upon each broad shell are perfect little
trees, one foot in height and with lusty wee
branches; at their bases are sea-grasses.
One shell, about- 15 inches across, grows
four perfect trees, each of a distinct variety,
so thickly foliaged that it is marvellous how
they economise the space. Amongst the tiny
branches of one there grow wee cobwebby
things "that are an exact imitation of bird's
nests; no doubt they are really the homes of
microscopic fishes. There is wavy sea-grass
around the trees, and amongst the grass there
stick up dried twigs resembling stumps.
Other shells, again, grow sponges amongst
their trees, and nearly all of them are
clustered with minute white shells. When
the shells are taken from the water the
trees turn in color to a brownisli-black, and
apparently become petrified.
“Malakuna” : The custom of native women
covering their bodies with clay in memory of
the dead husband (B. 25/8/’27) is wide-
spread in New Guinea, and there are vari-
ants. Having occasion last year to accom-
pany some “monkeys” (small boys) back to
their home at Ali Island, in the Aitape
district of the Mandated Territory, they
having completed their period of indenture, I
made the acquaintance of the K.C. mission
father stationed there. Together we con-
ducted the boys about a mile into the island
to a neat little village. Seated, before the
smouldering fire, taking no part in the taro-
cooking, was a toothless old hag covered in a
white lime-mixture. On seeing one boy in
our party she straightway began to rub the
scaly coating off. The missionary explained
that the boy was her dead daughter's son
and that when he set out on his travels the
old girl had assumed that he was lost to her
for ever, wherefore she smeared herself with
lime and sat down to await death. • The
boy was quite unaffected by the demonstra-
tion, pausing only to remark, “Lapun (old
woman), ’e mumma belong me.”
* * * *
“Titun”: Tell “Adah” (B. 8/9/’27) there
are numerous English skylarks in the heathy
country between Wonthaggi (Vic.) and the
sea. I have heard them, too, on the Bellar-
ine Peninsula, near Geelong, but have never
struck them away from the sea coast.
“Haad”: Along the old Tookeray-road, at
the entrance to the Victoria Dock (Vic.),
skylarks may be found in hundreds. In my
school days I remember taking my teacher
down to see and hear them. There- was a
two-up school near by and when some of
the lads were on the “flutter” they termed
it “going down to hear the skylarks.”
“Oilskin”: Skylarks are numerous in the
flat country on the outskirts of Melbourne.
They are particularly plentiful on the bay-
side flats behind Seaford and Carrum, and
on the Keilor Plains and round about Craigie-
burn and Donnybrook; I have also en-
countered them in the undulating country
between East Kew and Doncaster. You
can also hear the song of the English thrush
about Melbourne, but he is loth to leave the
gardens of eastern and southern suburbia.
On the other hand, the blackbird is well
established in many country districts.
* * * *
“Biliai” : The marvel of the departure of
the godwit gulls from the northernmost part
of Maoriland (B. 2S/7/’27) is outrivalled
by the migration of the penguins from the
Antarctic regions to the southern coasts of
M.L., especially when one considers that, as
the penguins swim all the way, they have
not the advantage of vision which the height
of flying birds gives them. Having brought
up their families in the Antarctic, they
strike out for the warmer north. How they
gather up and appoint leaders for their long
swim is unknown, but Captain Davis of the
Tutanekai cut across their lines several
times, and found as many as eight swimming
columns on a 250-mile front. Presumably,
when the head of one column strikes port,
some of the members go to right and left and
warn their brethren hi the rear to converge
to the Promised Land.

A GOAT OF CHILLAGOE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Columbus Breen was laundered clean
And wonderfully neat;
Although a navvy, he would pass
For one of the dlite.
He’d never cease his pants to crease.
He wore a gaudy bow,
And turned the heads of all the girls
In merry Chillagoe. .
Close to the mine, of rare design
His hut stood shining new,
With open windows on each side
To let the breezes through
And keep things sweet; for there’s some heat
In Queensland’s tropic clime,
And bugs and beetles, flies and ants
Put in much overtime.
One day “Flash” Breen in town was seen,
And little did he know
There came unasked into his hut
A goat of Chillagoe.
It helped itself from safe and shelf
With filthy greediness;
Of clothes and victuals on the floor
It made a horrid mess.
When Breen returned his brain just burned,
His face with rage went white.
He hastened to the hardware store
And bought some dynamite.
He caught the goat and round its throat
The plug lie firmly tied,
Then carefully lie lit the fuse,
And fast he homeward hied.
But man, O man! the goat began
Columbus to pursue;
Some say it was but playfully.
As oft its kind will do;
And through the street on winged feet
The race went with a thrill.
Columbus Breen all records broke;
Fast followed hairy Bill.
A TERRIBLE HANDICAP.
“Terrible thing to be bandy, ain’t it?”
“Yes—l wonder how a bloke like ’im holds a bottle when he wants to draw the cork?”
Breen gained his door, but not before
Bill bumped him in the rear;
And then there was a fearful bang
Like thunder, loud and clear.
Columbus Breen no more is seen,
And God alone can know
Where are the man, the goat, the hut—
They’re not at Chillagoe.
QUEENSLAND.

These are the
GENERAL MOTORS Cars
WHAT IT MEANS TO OWN A
GENERAL MOTORS CAR
ONE out of every four cars
bought in the world to-day is
a General Motors Car. Back
of this world-wide preference for
General Motors cars are human
wants and wishes, human hopes and
aspirations for the good things of
life at the lowest cost.
Every motor car buyer, everywhere,
from one end of the world to the
other, seeks the utmost value for his
money.
Individual needs and preferences
differ, of course. One may want a
small car, another a larger car. But
each wants the utmost in value at
the lowest price.
General Motors meets these wants
by building a car for every purse
and purpose—and by making each
car so fine in quality, and so sound
in value, that buyers prefer them.
Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile,
Oakland, Buick, La Salle, Cadillac,
Vauxhall —these are the General
Motors cars. From this you will
see that General Motors builds a
car for every purse and purpose.
Each is a better car because it is a
General Motors product. Each is
lower in price than it could be if it
were not a General Motors product.
Each of these cars, from the lowest
priced to the highest, benefits by the
discoveries and improvements of the
General Motors Research Labora-
tories, and the tests of the General
Motors proving ground.
Each benefits by the economies re
suiting from combined purchases.
The result is that you, the car-buyer,
get maximum value, fine beauty,
great safety, fine performance and
great economy when you buy a
General Motors car.
Wherever you buy a General Motors
car —and which ever car you choose
—you can be sure of its superior
quality—sure of its performance—
sure of its long life —sure of its value
—and sure of its operating economy.
Because these things are true, and
only because they are true, is it a
fact that one in every four cars
bought throughout the world is a
General Motors car.
Profit by the experience of 5,000,000
people who have bought General
Motors cars —buyers who know that
it pays to buy a General Motors car.

. “Pfella”’: Reading about unusual scrubs
111 recent Bulletin pars, reminds me of
one I struggled through near Yeppoon (Q.)
when my pants barely reached my knees,
Our two horses used to invade the old cane-
IMPARTIAL.
MISSIONARY: “I am informed that you are a great—ah—lady-
killer, is that correct?”
COON: “Not quite; I make no distinction between the sexes.”
fields, and many a morning I had to dodge
irate growers in getting the beasts home un-
seen. Once I went about a mile out of my
course to penetrate a belt of coastal scrub,
through which a Kanaka pad ran. Some-
how I missed Tommy Tanna’s tracks, and
I was soon in a maze of wild growth about
six to eight feet high. Dark-green wire vines
twfined round the short tree stems, covering
the tops with tough matted threads. The sea
roared on one side and the hills echoed the
boom on the other. After nearly an hour’s
battle, I shinned up a trunk, worked my
head through the vine-layers and got my
whereabouts. Half a dozen snakes, coiled
and basking in the sunshine, raised surprised
heads with mine. I was so scratched when
I finally got clear that I didn’t care if the
mokes got impounded, but not a cane-grower
was sighted that day.
He H* ❖ Hi
“Ivayeff” : Nauruan natives have a clever
method of catching eels. The wrigglers
are easy enough to hook, as any angler
knows, but hard to land without snarling up
yards of line. The native method substi-
tutes two sticks, each about 15in. long, for
the line. To one a small piece of meat,
preferably over-ripe, is tied; at the end of
the other is a running noose made from a
foot of good strong cord. The operator
prowls along the reef edge at low water,
thrusting the piece of meat into likely-looking
holes in the rocks, and then rubbing it to
and fro a few times near the hole. When
the eel pokes out his nose to sniff at the
bait, the handle with the noose is whipped
back and up, and the wriggler is drawn out
and landed on the rocks by a lightning
sweep. Only those who have tried to pull
an eel from a hole can fully appreciate the
speed required to switch him before he has
time to anchor, but when the trick is pro-
perly done he slips out as if greased.
“Booble” : I was returning home late one
afternoon through a paddock in which there
are always ’roos to be found. A chain or
thereabout off the road I came upon a
freshly-killed joey with two large eagles feed-
ing on it. The mother was standing about
50 yards or so away, watching the proceed-
ings. Neither eagles nor the old dop noticed
my presence. Next day, when passing about
the same time, I saw 16 ’roos, all full-grown,
solemnly gathered round about the few
bones the eagles had left. Nor did they move
away until I had watched them for two or
three minutes. I ride that paddock three or
four times a week and had never before
seen more than six ’roos together, nor more
than 32 in the paddock at once. Was it
an inquest or a funeral?
He He He He
“Top Bail”: Johnson, who’d acquired a
fair slice of the river bank, wanted to gain
some droving experience and engaged Small,
a good drover, to show him the ropes. The
scheme was to take
a mob of John-
son’s stock a week
to westward and
then bring them
back. W h e n
Small turned up
on Monday morn-
ing he found
Johnson’s saddle
draped with sun-
dry paraphernalia
he’d not encoun-
tered on a droving
expedition before;
but he said no-
thing, and they
turned their back's
on the sunrise.
They had a pretty
fair day of it but
for one big black-
and-white bullock
which played up
enough to keep
Small hopping. He
wasn’t sorry t o
turn the mob into
a reserve for the
night. After a
snack, Johnson
rigged up a roost
for himself with
some of the gear off
the saddle; then he
took off his clothes
and put on a suit
of striped pyjamas.
Small, sitting on
his haunches near
the fire, was look-
ing into the reserve,
where the big bul-
lock was still pretty
restless and mooch-
ing about. Presently
Johnson, who was
lying perched up on
one elbow, said:
“What’s the matter
with that big bul-
lock? He seems
very restless, doesn’t
he?” Small stood
up to the full
height of his six feet and spat into the fire.
“D’y know what?” he said. “I think he
muster fergot his striped pyjamas.”
* * *
. “Gouger”: Old Maino is a tough ex-ean-
nibal, with no regrets for the past except
that its table luxuries are no more. He
bosses Yam Island and has a considerable
influence, extending even to the shores of
New Guinea. To this day its natives bring
him every year a canoe-load of tribute, and
THE WRONG CUT.
“Yes, Mr. Trevarrow, I been down to Conference, and I went to see your daughter.
Nice house they’ve got in an acre of ground.”
“You’m quite right about the house, Mr. Sankey; but it bain’t an acre — bain’t the
right shape ’tall for an acre.”
it is a fine sight to see the little craft
skim lightly over the reef and up on the
sands till it rests almost beneath the roofs
of the village. The old chap possesses tele-
pathic powers of no mean order, one of his
recent feats being to order back, for the
special benefit of the one white schoolmaster
on the island, the supply cutter despatched
to Thursday Island. The boat had been five
weeks away. Maino “called” the captain;
then reported to the schoolmaster the date of
the vessel’s return. She anchored in front
of the village almost to the hour. When
Maino was going through the rites of initia-
tion to manhood, his uncle kissed him, slip-
ping into his mouth a small, hard object,
which Maino obediently chewed and swal-
lowed. He learned later that the pill was a
man’s dried tongue.
* * * *
“Trampas”: “Cunjevoi” (B. 8/9/’27} has
its uses, as many an experienced N.Q. scrub-
cutter knows. The tropical jungle from
which some of the richest cane-farms are
carved abounds in nasty surprises, among
them the stinging-tree. But Nature’s anti-
dote is nearly alw-ays handy, if you know
what and where to seek. Usually in a shaft
of sunlight spearing the tangled verdure over-
head, cunjevoi, quickly plucked and rubbed
on the agonising patch left by contact with
the stinging-tree, affords instant and unfail-
ing relief.

“M.L.C.” : The simple vessel we know as
“billycan” changes its gender and becomes
“Fanny” on board a British man-of-war.
Just about the time tinned mutton was intro-
duced into the navy as a weekly treat from
salt-horse, a certain Frances or Fanny Adams
was murdered in London, and portion of her
remains were distributed in various places,
including Deptford victualling yard. Con-
sequently tinned mutton acquired throughout
the service the sobriquet of “Fanny Adams,”
and all cans similarly shaped still com-
memorate the poor lady’s first name.

“C. Coral” : On Pooloo, Torres Strait, is
an outsized stone which the Mabuiag men
say dropped from the sky. It happened in
the days when mankind was guileless. The
sudden shock threw man and woman
together in a clutch of terror. Thence came
population. The island possesses another
monument in the form of a stone called
Kaumain,. bearing a resemblance to the
head and neck, of a man. Desiring a shave
one day, Kaumain called one of his numer-
ous wives and requested her. to .scrape him
with the bamboo implement used for the
purpose. Through clumsiness or jealousy
she inflicted a deep gash in his neck.
Thereupon Kaumain summarily ordered
her and her children to be deported to a spot
some distance out at sea. A group of great
boulders indicates where the exiled lady
and her progeny sit; while above frowns
Kaumain with a great gash in his neck, a
curious formation in the rock producing this
effect.

“Coot”: “Mulga’s” inquiry as to the origin
of “Never Never” (B. 15/9/’27) may be
answered by a quotation from F. de Brebant
Cooper’s “Wild Adventures in Australia”
(1857), containing the first printed refer-
ence to the term: “With the aid of three
stock keepers, Soon after my arrival at Illar-
rawarra, I had the cattle mustered, and the
draft destined for the Nievah vahs ready for
the road.” In a footnote the author adds:
“Nievah vahs (sometimes incorrectly pro-
nounced ‘never nevers’), a Comderoi term
signifying unoccupied land.”

“Ess”: Micky Boon wasn’t a true-blue
sundowner, for lie was always honestly look-
ing for “a nice easy job.” He liked to get into
a shed piece-picking or rolling fleeces, and if
offered anything harder than that generally
found a plausible excuse for turning it
down ; or if he took a job that did not prove
as suitable as he had expected, was suddenly
seized with a mysterious illness that forced
him to hurry off to consult an imaginary
doctor. At the shed where I met him there
was a vacancy for a sheep-penner, a dusty
job that needed some activity and energy.
“I’ve got a weak heart,” was Micky’s excuse.
“If I exert myself too much I’m likely to
drop dead.” Then lie was offered an easier
billet, but it wasn’t a nice one. “I w r ant a
man for the poison cart,” said the boss.
Micky swung the swag on to his back. “If
I meet one on the road,” he said, “I’ll tell
him.”

“Emel”: He was putting in a new axe-
handle, grumbling to himself as he did so.
“Been cutting some tough wood?” the passer-
by asked. “It’s the missus,” w r as his
aggrieved answer. “She breaks the bloomin’
axe-handles as fast as I put ’em in. I’ll
have to get somebody else to cut the wood!”

“The Welkin”: Simpson had no use for
his neighbor Sands. “He’s sich a mean
cow!” he explained. “Went over to his place
yesterdee t’ get a fork I'd lent him, and
when I arrives there I find him skinnin
rabbits. Y’ needn’t believe me unless y’ like,
but he skinned the paws.”

EXPERIMENTAL FARMS.
“Jack Point”: "Cheinico” (B. 18/8/’27)
hits the nail on the head when he advocates
little experimental farms in various districts.
Such farms could deal with local aspects
of agriculture as well as soil analysis. In
tin' U.S. experimental stations, generally
linked up with a University, are scattered
all over the country. But we import Uncle
Jonathan’s crazy ideas and leave his sane
ones alone. Such stations needn’t be a
charge on the State, as stock and crops
raised in experiments can generally be sold
at good prices, and there are still people
who are prepared to pay for short, practical
courses of instruction. In the U.S. experi-
ments are often conducted which take four
or five years to complete, but the interim
reports made available to cockies are of
immense value. Our population not being
as big as Uncle’s, Ave can’t afford to have
as many places as he has, but certainly a
start could be made with a few devoted
to wool-groAving, wheat-groAving and poultry-
raising, say, as well as soil analysis.
TREE-GROWING FOR PROFIT.
“Spike”: “W.M.F.” (B. l/9/’27) advo-
cates the growing of timber in Australia as
a means of money-making, and qualifies his
notion by mentioning a block of timbered
country, 32 acres in area, which, although
thoroughly combed by teamsters for years,
still harbored sufficient timber to pay the
purchase-money,
I have about 8000 acres of perhaps the
best timbered country in N. S. Wales. We
have a sawmill adjacent to the property and
another mill four miles distant to which the
teamsters (eight all told) also draAV. Our
royalty on mill-logs averages about £5O per
month, which represents an annual return by
way of interest on capital of 3 per cent.
This is more than eaten up in rates, taxes
and overhead.expenses.
The market for pole timber is restricted
and is an unsatisfactory one from the
grower’s point of view. Ignorance amongst
pole-buyers regarding the durability of Aus-
tralian timbers is astonishing. Ironbark is
specified on almost every order, when there
are very many hardwoods equally as dur-
able. To obviate a possible “ring in,” the
oversea orders now specify two feet of bark
to be left on the point of each stick. This
compels the cutter to fall the specified timber
only, and simply means that the grower must
wait many more years before his hardwood
poles, as mill-logs, are fit to grace the satv-
bench.
The Bulletin has always championed the
cause of afforestation, chiefly because, the
frenzied use of the axe has in the past been
far too prevalent. Latterly, however, the
owners of coastal timbered country have
awakened to the fact that to clear this class
of country and keep it clean costs more
than the land is worth. The growing timber
is practically their sole asset, and by fixing
a minimum girth measurement they are
enabled to prevent indiscriminate slaughter
of young trees, and thus continue to collect
whatever meagre profits there are to be had.
The Forestry Department, by placing an
almost prohibitive royalty on Crown timber,
is also working along sound lines in regard
to the preservation of its forests. This,
together with the unpatriotic policy of Goi r-
ernments, past and present, in assisting lum-
ber rings in America to reap fortunes with
their Oregon in this country to the detri-
ment of local retailers, means that the risk
of a future dearth in Australian hardwoods
is reduced almost to a minimum.
FORESTRY CONFERENCE.
“Rukli”: As an outcome of the last
Imperial Conference, the Federal authorities
have arranged to hold an Australasian for-
estry conference at Perth during the first
Aveek in September, 1928. Invitations have
been issued to various Empire experts, in-
cluding one whose specialty is the seasoning
of eucalyptus timbers and tanning. After
meeting at Perth the conference will be split
up into sections, each of which will spend six
weeks in one or other State, meeting again
for a week’s corroboree at Canberra. That
the delegates will leave for a fort-
night’s tour of Maoriland. All matters re-
lating to forestry will be considered, from
fire-control to paper-making, an important
item being the standardisation of the trade
and colloquial names of Australian trees and
timbers—a fairly large job in itself in
a country where many trees and timbers
carry half a dozen different names in the
same State.
MORE ABOUT BABY BEEF.
“Almanac”: “F.Y.7’s” dissertation on
baby beef (B. 8/9/’27) gets us nowhere.
First he says that the beef-eaters avlio once
asked for matured meat at least four
years old now insist on cuts from cattle
uot more thau 18 months. That’s nonsense.
What the Australian butcher and consumer
require is prime ox beef of about 70U1b., and
•neither the wholesale nor retail buyer cares
a cuss whether the beast is two or four
years old as long as it is prime quality.
Furthermore, trie pink color of baby beef
is never so attractive as the red meat of
the more matured beast.
Also “F.Y.7” says “the buyer is inclined
to look for the beast in which ribs, loin and
thighs are prominent, and the unprofitable
fore-end negligible. These requirements can
easily be met by the British and American
breeders.” I ask him what particular beast
fills his specification? Certainly no Aus-
tralian cattle of my acquaintance.
As for the alleged unprofitable fore-
quarter—well, it simply isn’t. There are
any amount of Melbourne and Sydney sub-
urban butchers who work on practically a
forequarter trade, not only in beef but to
some extent in mutton also. Their location
is in industrial parts, and one butcher of
my acquaintance has founded no fewer than
14 shops on this class of trade. There pro-
bably always will be a great demand for
the choice cuts, but the wholesaler can gen-
erally meet the family-trade demand for
hindquarters and rumps and loins by break-
ing the carcase. The fore-end buyer is mostly
the purchaser of the butt, too. A good
butcher can give you a choice “rump steak”
from the loin just as he can make a “leg
chop” from a forequarter of mutton.
As for profitably supplying trade require-
ments with 18-months-old stock, it can’t be
done unless the beasts are left running Avith
their mothers in bounteous seasons. The
Government farm at Werribee has made exten-
sive experiments with practically every class
of stock, and although the cattle it sends
to the Newmarket saleyards are splendid, it
hasn’t been able to evolve the freak beast
that “F.Y.7” suggests.
BEEF-MARKETING “DONT’S.”
“Almanac” : For export or home consump-
tion don’t breed beef from the Jersey. Its
orange-colored fat is repulsive to the con-
sumer and its hide has 'very little value.
Don’t make the mistake of . thinking a
mud-fat beast is prime. It is wasteful for
both butcher and buyer.
If you have prime 6001 b. beasts and
there’s no beef glut, don’t Avait for them to
accumulate another hundredweight, but send
them to market —this sort always fetches
its value.
Don’t raise mammoth boasts of 0001 b. and
over; not even the big hotel and shipping
providores want these now —about 8001 b. is
their limit. Top off as quickly as season arid
circumstances will permit, thus getting capi-
tal to restock the land formerly occupied by
the beasts disposed of. To this day some of
the big stations seem to place more import-
ance on topping the market with a few
selected heavyweights than on getting
quicker and more profitable returns from
young prime stock.
NORTH QUEENSLAND’S FREEZERS.
“N.M.L.”: Cattle prices are low in N.Q.
just now. A recent quotation gave fat bul-
locks selling in Adelaide and Melbourne at
425. per hundred, and the N.Q. freezing
works are getting supplies at 17s. Of course,
in Adelaide and Melbourne most of the killing
is for local consumption. The works in
N.Q. kill for export, but that doesn’t explain
the whole of the disparity in price.
The average annual killing of cattle in
N.Q. works is under 300,000. To handle
those cattle there are five meat w-orks. A
couple of the biggest have a killing capacity
of 750 cattle a day, besides being able to
cope with several thousand sheep, and the
smallest of them dwindles down to 250 a
day. It’s safe to say that these five works
cost £1,000,000 in the aggregate. Capital is
earning interest for only about four months
of the year, and all the rest of the time the
plants are lying idle. Somebody has to
pay, and the cattle-owners foot the bill in
the long run, and not too long a run at that,
either.
What is the remedy? I’d say it was fewer
meat works. Two big factories, or a number
of smaller ones, operating at spaced centres,
going for nine or ten months of the year,
instead of only three to five, would mean an
appreciable saving to the producer. There
would be cattle to keep them going. I’ve
known bullocks in the primest of condition
leave the saltbush plains on the Georgina
River as late as November in an average
year. I’ve known fat cattle come from the
coastal areas in February. Cattle at their
top may be taken from different in
the north during every month between Feb-
ruary and November.
As things are, as soon as the killing sea-
son opens, usually in April, there’s one
almighty rush to get cattle in. I’ve seen
cattle going to the works, a trainload from
the coastal area chasing a load from the
dry interior. They can’t both be. at their
top at the same time, but they are pushed in
just the same.
Roughly, the cattle in the different zones
are fit for the works at about the following
periods of the year: Coastal, north and east,
March to May. Coastal tableland, April to
the frosts —say, end of Julie. Central
plateau—Torrens Creek to Cloncurry—say
June to September. Far west, June to the
extreme heat of the middle of summer. If
the cattle from the different zones were
killed when at their top: if there was no
rush and bustle; if the works operated for
10 months of the year instead of for only
three or four, there’d be an appreciable re-
duction in Avaste, a considerable saving to
the producer, and prices would improve.
SMALL CLIPS AND WOOL POOLING.
“R. E. Combing” : The suggestion made by
“Leo Lear” for the pooling and inter-class-
ing of small men’s wool clips (B. 25/S/’27)
deserves support. We get worked up over
tar-brands, jute-fibres and all sorts of
trifling matters, but the preparation of the
wool for market doesn’t get as much atten-
tion as it might. One realises how money
and effort are wasted if he walks along any
broker’s floor and observes the succession
of small lots, similar in style and bought for
the same class of orders, yet offered sepa-
rately. A little difference in initial treat-
ment would standardise them, and subtle
differences of growing conditions, which
make small variations of appearance, would
be smoothed out by blending, as happens
when the staple is being sorted up for manu-
facturing.
The thing could be very easily managed,
as far as I can see. If a few farmers in one
district were to shear their sheep in one
centre and have their clips classed up to-
gether as one, tally being kept of the indi-
vidual weights Avhich go into each parcel,
excellent results could be obtained. There
is only , one thing to stop it and that is the
suspicion of each man for the other fellow,
which seems to be a big factor with Mr.
Cocky. Every man thinks his own sheep
and wool are better than his neighbor’s or,
even if he does allow pride of place to the
other chap, it is seldom to the extent of
allowing that his firsts ought to go in with
the other man’s seconds.
Woolbrokers are doing their best by
grouping different owners’ star lots together
in One big line of generally similar charac-
ter. but differences of original handling and
variations of districts are a great hin-
drance. Wool classing for buyers’ require-
ments can bo done effectively only straight
off the sheep’s back. But, as far as it can
be taken, the system is an acknowledged
success for everyone concerned, and these
lots probably attract keener competition than
any other section of the catalogue. The
buyer gets a fair-sized parcel for one thing
and for another the nature of the parcel
obviates the possibility of “splitting,” which
is such a nuisance with the ordinary big lots.
But many growers are still suspicious of the
system, arid will not have their wool inter-
lotted with tnat of any other grower.
There is a definite request to-day for
fewer lots in wool catalogues. The huge
number which a buyer has to value every
season is a severe disability to him. The
fewer lots he has to value, the better atten-
tion he can give to each, and the less chance
there is of some of them being neglected, to
the profit of the speculator.
THE “DRAFT” ON WOOL.
“Lath”: Neither “Meum et Tuum” (B.
15/9/’27) “Trepex” (B. 18/8/'27) nor any
others in expressing their views on the
“draft” have made reference to the fact
that wool is sold on “in” and not on “out”
weights. As soon as a clip is received into
store it is weighed and then stacked ayvait-
ing sale; but as the sales are limited in
quantity, the clip may be weeks in store
before it is auctioned. A list of the weights
is forwarded to the owner as soon as the
wool is weighed, which enables him to check
them w-ith his own weighings, and if a mis-
take has been made the opportunity is
afforded of rectifying it, which would not
be possible if the wool were sold on “out”
weights.
As the wool sales are held during the
spring and summer months, it is more than
likely that the wool will lose Aveight between
the period of arriving in store and being
auctioned, though, of course, should the
season be a wet one, the contrary would be
the case; but this is the exception and not
the rule. If wool were sold on “out"
weights, there would be no reason for allow-
ing “draft,” as the weighing would then
take place after the wool had been sold;
but if this were the custom it would be
impossible to deliver the wool for shipment
with anything like the promptitude that is
reached under the existing system, and the
owner would not get his account sales and
cheque for a considerable time after the sale.
As wool, in average seasons, loses weight
between receipt into store and sale, and the
grower gets liis cheque within 14 days of
sale, surely it is to his advantage to accept
the deduction of lib. per cwt. without demur.
“Meum et Tuum’s” remark that buyers
are trained men cuts no ice. A buyer is just
as likely to over-estimate as to under-esti-
mate, the value of the wool. I have yet to
meet the “expert” who never made a mis
take. The best are those who make the
fewest.
RABBIT DESTRUCTION.
“Mullarula”: Of all methods of rabbit
destruction the use of poisoned water has
given the best results wherever conditions
have been suitable. It will work only where
watorholes are few and far between, and
where dry spells are long. Arsenic is the
poison most favored, though I have heard
of cyanide being used. The arsenic is dis-
solved by boiling about a quarter of a pound
in a bucket made from a five-gallon drum.
The water from the bucket is then mixed
with about five or six times its bulk in a
hole dug for the purpose alongside a water-
hole or dam at which rabbits are in the
habit of watering. The unpoisoned water-
hole is fenced with rabbit-proof netting, and
the poisoned hole is surrounded by a fence
which will keep out stock but not rabbits.
There must be some unpleasant taste about
the poisoned water, for rabbits .will drink it
only on a hot night which follows an
unbroken previous spell of hot weather.
If conditions are right the neighborhood
will be covered with bunny corpses in tie l
morning, some within a'yard of the water,
odd stragglers a quarter of a mile away, and
the thickest harvest about a hundred yards
away.
It is advisable to pick up the dead ’uns,
especially on the watershed, and stack them
in heaps for burning if timber is available.
It is also advisable to get on the job early,
as victims of arsenic don't keep well in warm
weather. I have known over 20,000, by
actual count, to be poisoned in a single
night, and it was estimated at Shearings
tank, west of Cobar, that one night’s bag
totalled 50,000. Several times in the dry
south-west of N. S. Wales the pest has been
so reduced by poisoned water during hot
summers that a rabbit was a rarity for a
year or so, but of course, they came back
inter.
PASTURE AT DRINKING PLACES.
“Furphy”: “N.M.L.” (B. l/9/’27\ says
that when stock congregate at one drinking
place “the feed for a radius of a mile or
more is chopped out by churning hooves."
A mile radius would mean, roughly, 2000
acres of bare ground. “N.M.L.” gives the
grazing-range limit of sheep as two miles
from water. so the total area within tlm
two-mile radius would be, approximately.
10,000 acres, less 2000 acres “churned out,"
leaving 8000 acres of grass within reach
of the sheep. Supposing that this country
has the high capacity of two sheep to the
acre, 10,000 sheep couldn’t tramp 2000 acres
bare of feed. The number of sheep necessary
to do such extensive damage could not pos-
sibly be watered at one place. In any
case and if it were vvithin the bounds of
possibility, Avhat good sheep-man, however
extravagant, would attempt to run such a
huge flock in one paddock? Furthermore,
merino sheep invariably come right in to
Avater on a pad, camp somewhere handy and
then feed out in the afternoon. They con-
form to this habit whatever their numbers or
the size of their paddock.
SYMPTOMS OF CYANIDE.
“Cucliulain”: One of the chief symptoms
of cyanide-poisoning is a tendency on the
part of stock to lick their OAyn hair. The
animal that has taken a bait not deadly
enough to kill it outright has a hot, dry
nose, and persistently licks some part of its
body. A coav. recently poisoned, licked every
hair from the hoof to the hock of one of
her hind legs. Fortunately she was not too
far gone Avlien found, and after the vet. had
used a strong drench she recovered.
CARELESSNESS WITH CYANIDE,
“Borgia” : A deputation from the Farmers
and Settlers' Association and the Primary
Producers’ Union told N.S.W. Chief-Secre-
tary Gosling the other day that the ease
with which potassium cyanide, deadliest of
poisons, could be purchased in N.S.W. was
a scandal. One instance out of many quoted
was the loss of 24 bullocks, 14 stud sheep
and three horses killed as the result of a night-

Dear Sirs, —In February, 1925, I took delivery of a line of Weaners which I purchased
on Monaro, and after I got them home they turned out to be very flukey and weie dying
like flies. I purchased a ton of “LIX-ALL” through your Agents at Junee, and began
giving it to these flukey sheep. Very soon I saw an improvement in them and they left
Off dying, and in the course of a few months they had left off coughin' and they were
quite sound and healthy. It gives me much pleasure and satisfaction t<- recommend the
“LIX-ALL” to anyone who may have flukey sheep.
Kindly send me another half ton immediately. \ Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir, —T already have a supply of “LIX-ALL,”
and have used same in the dry time, and I find it
to be a good lick; sheep put on condition, whilst
other sheep on other licks lost condition. Would
like to tell you that I have recommended it to
others in this district, and will do by best for
you.

raid by unknown "possum poisoners who had
no right or authority to enter the property at
all. The trouble has been intensified by the
general clearing of trees from farm paddocks.
Only those fringing the watercourses are
left. To them the ’possums throng, and
there the baits are laid; to them, too, the
stock resort for shade—with dire conse-
quences. The deputation asked that the
selling of cyanide should be put under strict
police supervision, and that the use of the
stuff without a police permit should be made
a criminal offence. The Chief Secretary
vaguely said he’d make inquiries.
CAUSES AND CURE OF BRACKEN.
“Te Hipi”: The growth of bracken on
grassed country is due to insufficient stock-
ing with cattle. In M.L. it has ruined a
large number of small sheep farmers who,
at the start of the present beef slump, sold
all their steers to make room for the more
profitable sheep. The land soon reverted
to second growth and bracken. On the
shady sides of the hills especially the brac-
ken made rapid headway, because sheep
always keep to the sunny slopes, where the
grass is sweeter. The cattle keep to the
shady side, because the absence of the sheep
makes the growth of grass much ranker.
The only remedies found so far are extra-
heavy stocking with cattle coupled with
liberal top-dressing with manure; or stock-
ing with pigs and laying down a new pas-
ture afterwards. Both are expensive. The
former means a very poor return for two
or three years, besides a heavy outlay on
manure. The latter means a big expense in
reinforcing fences to hold the pigs and a
substantial expenditure on grass-seed. Which
method pays the best depends on the state
of the cattle and pig markets. In M.L. the
pig is regarded as the reliable remedy ; cattle
are a much more speculative proposition in
every way.
BRACKEN CONQUERED.
“Black Tracker”: For the last 20
years the trustees of the Lowan Estate
(S.A.) have been struggling to make it pay
its way, but the poor, white sandy soil,
thickly covered with bracken, would grow
neither cereals nor wool. Then the manager,
after experimenting with subterranean
clover, put 600 acres of the worst land under
it. He ran a disc-cultivator over it and
drilled in 31b. of seed with a mixture of
lcwt. superphosphate and 3cwt. crushed-
rock phosphate to the acre. Now, after
two years, the clover is spreading fast and
splendid grazing areas are developing. As
there are tens of thousands of acres of
similar country in the district it is proving
a most valuable object-lesson.
POTATO-GROWING IN QUEENSLAND.
“Bad Australian”: If “Sucre” (B.
22/9/’27) will read my par again he will
find that I did not say that “there are some
good potato-growing patches on the Burnett.”
NVhat I did say was that there are some fine
patches of land on the Burnett, but this
land would need to be at an elevation of
at least 3000 feet above sea-level before it
could reasonably be expected to grow pota-
toes similar in quantity and quality to those
of Southern Vic. or the North Coast of Tas.
During several years’ wandering in Queens-
land I saw very few potatoes growing at any
altitude, but I have seen plenty of them in
another country between corresponding paral-
lels of latitude at elevations ranging from
a few hundred feet above sea-level to 10,000
feet. The crops grown at the lower altitudes
showed a heavy growth of coarse, rank
haulms, the tubers being small and few to
a hill, and my observations led me to the
conclusion that heavy crops of potatoes can-
not be grown in the tropics at an elevation
of less than 3000 feet. “Sucre” has nothing
to say about the yield per acre on the Ather-
ton tableland, and his assertion that the dis-
trict produces “the best spuds in Australia”
should be backed by something more than a
mere assertion.
RICE ON THE MURRUMBIDGEE.
“Ibis”: After experiments with tobacco
and peanuts, which weren’t very success-
ful—importers helped to queer the pitch—
Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area cookies have
turned to rice, and this time they seem to have
backed a winner. In 1925-26, 380 acres were
planted. In 1926-27, 1800 acres; and in
1926-27, 4600 acres were under paddy. In the
coming season probably about 9000 acres will
be sown. The average yield has steadily
increased, 40 bushels to the acre being the
3925 average and 86 bushels the average for
3927. The price of £l2 per ton (including
subsidy of 305.) pays well enough, and givpn
fairly dry autumns for harvesting the cocky
doesn’t do badly. The rice-fields provide
excellent duck-shooting out of season, too.
POINTS OF THE CAMP-HORSE.
“N.M.L.” : Cattle-men, when deploring the
scarcity of good camp-horses, generally say:
“We’ve been so busy we haven’t had a chance
to break any in.” Good camp-horses can-
not be broken in any more than ducks can
be taught to swim—their work comes natural
to them. After a horse has been ridden with
cattle a while and given a bit of work on
a camp, its aptitude for the job can easily
be judged. The first and most important
sign is that the horse watches a beast. The
progeny of some stallions show a marked
predilection for this work, and the progeny
of others, while good animals after a beast,
never pay that close attention which makes
the pride of the stockman.
When a youngster shows his ability to
watch a beast, and when he turns with or
just before that beast, all he wants is prac-
tice. and not too much of it for a start.
Nothing sours a horse more quickly than an
overdose of camp work when lie’s not used
to it.
The best horses are those which have a
dash of toe, which gain full pace from the
first bound, and particularly those which
watch the eyes of the beast. I’ve seen
horses which let the rider know there was a
turn coming several strides before the beast
actually turned. The horse would gather
his legs under him, bunching himself, as it
were, and, though pacing freely, showing a
certain restraint in his stride. Without
exception, a beast will roll its eyes before
it turns, and the good camp-horse watches
for that.
CAPONS AND “SURPRISE BOXES.”
“Te Hipi”: “Mrs. Lance Rawson’s” plea
for the capon <B. l/9/’27) doesn’t move me
much. The expense entailed in starting puts
a damper on the scheme, and she hasn’t
lightened the gloom at all with her scheme
of “surprise boxes.” Suppose we place the
selling price of the 12s. 6d. box she put on
the market before the war at 255. for present-
day value. Itemising the contents we have:
Box fitted with hinges and lock
and packing same, say 2s. 6d.
Vegetables for one week 3s. 6d.
Fruit ditto 3s. 6d.
Three dozen eggs' at Is. 6d 4s. 6d.
Freight both ways Is. Od.
Killing, cleaning, dressing and stuf-
fing bird (including cost of
stuffing ingredients) 3s. Od.
Total 18s. Od.
This leaves 7s. to cover everything else,
including the bird. Is that enough? Con-
sidering the extra time taken to rear, the
extra food consumed, and the cost of opera-
tion on the bird, to say nothing of the time
and expense in obtaining lessons in capon-
ising, dressing and trussing, it seems a pretty
poor return.
CROP-BOUND CHICKENS.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: Re crop-bound
chickens (B. 8/9/’27). This is an indi-
cation of either overfeeding or improper
feeding, and rarely happens when the birds
have a free range, be it ever so small, where
they can pick up their own natural medi-
cines. The grey wood-louse found under
old timber or rocks is the natural cure for
crop-bound hens or chickens. If they are
free you’ll notice them looking about for
these creatures, which once taken into the
crop dissolve the hard undigested matter in
a few minutes. Incubator chicks are liable
to many ills which an old hen-mother will
correct, for which reason they do best with
a hen for a week or two after hatching
from the incubator.
GLOUCESTER OLD SPOT PIGS.
“Black Tracker” : A most profitable pig for
the small man to keep is Gloucester Old Spot,
a new breed which is giving fine results.
At one of the S.A. country shows W. Ald-
ridge, of Angle Vale, showed a sow. of this
breed that had produced 32 suckers in three
litters, the last 11 being exhibited. They
looked a bonny lot, some weighing 351 b. when
four weeks old and 4Slb. at five weeks.
Those of a former litter went 2101 b. at the
age of five months.
CHINESE CABBAGE CULTURE.
“The Welkin”: A method adopted by John
Chinaman to increase plant yield is to pull
half-grown vegetables such as cabbages and
cauliflowers from the ground and scoop out
of the stem a fissure, in which a little cotton-
wool is placed. The vegetables are then
placed in long troughs containing strong
manure water. The w T ool absorbs the manure
and the results are amazing. The vegetables,
in addition to being exceptionally large, are
of prime quality.
FIRE SAPPING.
“Furphy”: Dig down on one side of your
tree —the prevailing-wind side for choice-y-
-cutting the surface roots as you go, until
you reach the main tap root. Cut the tap
“into the red” across its whole width, and
then pack the hole with good solid chunks of
wood which will insure a hot fire for some
hours. If this is done properly, the tree
will die in a very short time and can be
burned out in a few months.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Lucerne Flea”: The best way of pre-
venting spontaneous combustion in lucerne
stacks is to add small quantities at a time,
and let each layer on the stack dry out
thoroughly before putting on the next. In
addition, about 141 b. of coarse salt should
be sprinkled over each layer. The salt, in
addition to making the hay keep better and
rendering it more palatable to stock, keeps
the fodder cool. Of course, the drawback to
building stacks slowly is that a sudden
change in the weather may bring rain, and
ruin the hay. In consequence, some stackers
build small stacks and keep tarpaulins
handy, while others build them with a
fairly high crown right from the start.
“Iv.D.S.” In the matter of aborting cows,
this trouble, being contagious, causes loss to
the dairyman which can’t be stopped by
vets, at a moment’s notice. But an old and
ridiculous remedy can be tried early as a
preventive. Borrow a William goat of
high odor, and for a week or so tether him
in the cowsheds. For some daft reason, that
the experts can wrangle over if they want
to, the cows overcome the ti’ouble, which
does not recur. \\ illiam’s tenancy seems to
render sheds immune. Presumably, the germ
or whatever it is can’t abide Bill.
“Pick”: In frosty regions, to ensure an
early potato crop, spread over the field after
sowing a two-feet layer of tussock-grass or
the straw from last threshing. As more
genial times approach spindly stalks will
gradually wrnrk their way through the layer
above, while the tubers below are in no way
retarded. Ploughed in for next season the
protection makes an excellent manure.
“Saaedi” : In yarding ewes with young
unmarked lambs at foot care must be taken,
more particularly when the percentage of
lambs is heavy and the ewes are young.
When the sheep get hustled, as they often
do when being forced into yards, the lambs
lose their mothers and tend to drift to the
outside of the mob, where they are very
liable to get out of control and scatter in
all directions regardless of the efforts of
men and dogs to wheel them. This collecting
of lambs on the outside of the mob must be
avoided as much as possible, and whenever
they start to work out they should be forced
into the flock. Only a quiet, wide-working
dog is any use in yarding ewes with lambs
at foot.
“Wandi”: To keep flies off horses’ eyes,
smear round the eyes with patent axle-
grease. Olive oil is also good, but has to
be applied every day. Either application is
better than using a veil, and enables the
horse to feed in peace.

THE PITILESS ORIENT.
The Chinaman, inscrutable ever, gazed
with leering eyes at the girl standing de-
fiantly before him. A compatriot was at
his side, his face equally unfathomable.
The girl, wringing her hands in anguish,
looked round the sordid room. She imagined
other eyes were peering at her from the dark
recesses beyond the den in which she was
undergoing her ordeal. With
an effort she again faced the
unyielding look of her in-
quisitors.
She steadied her agitated
.voice, and made another
appeal, vainly hoping that
behind the yellow mask
might be some latent instinct
of mercy. No such emotion,
showed itself in those immo-
bile features; and despair
again gripped her as her
pathetic appeal was met with
the same slurred phrase in
pidgin English that now
from sheer repetition was
searing itself into her soul.
With misery in her heart
she left the hovel, realising
that no compassion could be
expected from these relentless
people.
Once more in the street
and its pure air, some of her
old spirit came back to her,
and she turned towards her
home with renewed courage.
As she walked along the
pavement, her footsteps beat
time to the phrase that the
Chinese had dinned into her
head so often of late: “No

in Spring P
r T”'HE simplest way to get rid of pimples, rashes, eczema,
* roughness and irritation, is to cleanse carefully and
anoint with Zam-Buk Balm.
Zam-Buk, being so highly refined, soaks -into the pores and
purifies the underlying tissues. Eruptions and itching soon
subside under this natural treatment, and the skin is thereby
restored to a sound healthy state.
Nothing is so good for the skin as Zam-Buk, whether it bo
a simple spot, or for eczema, ulcers or other grave disfigure-
ment. Being free from animal fat and insoluble mineral
drugs, Zam-Buk does good in serious cases where a fatty
ointment would be absolutely useless.
The outstanding success of Zam-Buk is due to its unique
herbal character, purity, high refinement and unusual pene-
trative power. A handy box of Zam-Buk is an excellent
first-aid for cuts, bruises, burns, etc., and a real insurance
against skin disease. 1/6 & 3/6 all chemists.
“TJAYING 16 yeai’s’ experience with Zam-Buk, I can
confidently pronounce it the finest soothing and
skin-growing agent it is possible to employ.
“I was burnt from head to foot, during research
work, and for a long time was in the hands of a well-
known surgeon. It was only Zam-Buk that caused strong
new skin to grow when I was told my body would need to
be permanently bandaged,"

Associate of the Institute of Chemistry.

A Love Affair of Dave’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAVE and Lil fell out. They liad fallen
out several times, and always Dave
ate humble pie, took all the blame and
held out the olive-branch. But now his back
was stiffened. After brooding over matters
in the corn paddock he decided to stand no
more of it; if Lil wouldn’t go down on her
knees to him she could stick with Paddy
Maloney, and be hanged to her —and him,
too ! Then shaking dust and leaves off him-
self he went about his work, whistling as
he went.
When anyone came to the home who was
in touch with Lil Dave’s lightheartedness
knew no bounds. He talked and laughed
as if under contract to entertain them.
Dave remembered how Lil had confided to
him that her friends had told her they had
seen him looking ill and right down broken-
hearted —that was once when they weren’t
speaking. So now, whenever he chanced to
pass her place in the spring-cart he worked
himself up into song, and rattled by singing
his loudest to the old horse and to the jack-
asses perched on the fencing-posts along the
way. She would see that, though jilted, he
could still be jolly!
But the time went on and no signs of
repentance or of an armistice were coming
from Lil. Worse still, she rode past one day
between Paddy Maloney and Bill Anderson,
and didn’t turn her head when Dave called
“Good-day” and waved a tuft of grass he had
pulled from the nose of the plough.
“By cripes,” he snarled, staring after them,
“she’s a caution !”
That afternoon all his gaiety left him. He
had neither word nor smile for anyone. When
night came on he lost his edge completely,
refused supper and went quietly to his room.
Without complaint he went to bed and got
right under the blankets. Mother, who soon
became concerned, went in and questioned
him. Dave sighed indifferently ; said he felt
a bit crook, that was all.
“The ploughing is far too hard for the
boy,” mother said, coming from the room and
joining the rest of us at the blazing fire.
“And he hasn’t been eating like he should
at all lately.”
“He’s all right, mother,” dad assured her,
“an’ th’ ploughin's a lot harder for th’
horses.”
Mother turned to Sarah. “Put the kettle
on by-an’-bye, my girl, and I’ll make him a
hot drink and rub his chest for him.”
“I never heard him say anything”—this
wonderingly from Sarah.
Leaving the fire she went to the door of
Dave’s room. “What’s the matter, Dave?”
she inquired, putting her head in.
“Oh, nothin' very much, Sarah.” he mut-
tered in the voice of an invalid, “I’ll be
orright d’reckly.” And then to hint that he
was concealing how really bad he was he
sighed distressfully, and rolling over in the
bed broke into a fit of muffled coughing
which sounded like a dog barking in its
sleep.
“The boy isn’t well,” mother, her eyes
filling with alarm, turned to dad. “He
doesn’t often have a cough, and never gives
in like that.”
“Nonsense,” dad answered, turning over
the newspaper. “Some hair blew off th’
horses, mebbe, an’ went down bis throat.
Where’s the other half th’ paper?”
“ ‘To s-s-stand tli’ s-s-season at Mount
S-S-Sibley,’ ” Joe began reading from the
other half.
“Here!” dad interrupted. “What do you
want it for? Get your books and learn what
you got to know to-morrer.”
Joe handed over the sheet, and bouncing
to his bare feet, joined Sarah.
“Hello. D-D-Dave!” he saluted. “Yer gone
to b-b-bed, have y’? Wliat’s th’ m-m-mat-
ter?”
“Bit off color” —and Dave patted himself
significantly about the chest. “A bit sore
down here, too,” indicating his ribs.
“D-d-did y’ get a k-kick from th’ plough-
handle?”
That helped Dave a lot. “A bit of one,”
he promptly admitted. “But go on out;
don’t stand talkin’.” Then lie moaned.
“He got hurt with the plough-handle,”
Sarah, returning to the fire, announced.
“That’s what’s up with him.”
“It k-k-kicked him in th’ r-r-ribs,” Joe
confirmed. “Same as it did M-M-Mulrooney’s
newchum who got k-k-killed from one.”
“I thought there was something,” and
mother rose suddenly again. “Dave wouldn’t
give in like that if there wasn’t. And he’s
been keeping it from me.”
Dad put down the paper, and in silence
followed mother to the sick-room.
“So you got hit with the plough, my poor
boy?” mother, leaning over Dave, crooned.
“Let me see where you are hurt —turn over
and show your father.”
Dave, wheezing and screwing faces, turned
carefully over and whimpered.
“There, on that side it caught me. But
it’s not that what’s wrong. I got a bit of
a cold, that’s all.” Dave was a martyr in
illness.
Dad eyed him like an army surgeon, and
felt the injured side with his horny hand.
“The boy’s ribs might be broken!” mother,
following dad’s movements, suggested.
Dave, making the most of her suggestion,
flinched, shrunk from dad’s horny touch, and
mumbled “ 8-s-steady !”
“Oh, careful, father,” mother warned, plac-
ing her hand on the surgeon to restrain him
in the patient’s interests ; “you might press
the broken part into his lungs!”
“Can y’ feel that?” dad asked callously,
giving Dave such a squeeze that he nearly
jumped out of bed.
“Cripes! Steady on !” he said, in anything
but the voice of an invalid.
“Might ha’ knocked it a bit,” dad con-
cluded, “but it ain’t broke. It’s th’ winter
a-coming on. Cover him over, mother, an’
let him go to sleep.” Then with a sex-ies of
grunts dad went back to the fire and the
newspaper.
But mother in an anxious mood remained
a Avhile longer with the patient. She tucked
him in; smoothed his brow with her hand ;
asked if his chest was sore, and Avhen it was
he first felt ill. Dave ansAvered in coughs
and sighs so that he wouldn’t commit him-
self. Dave was a wary invalid.
“You’i'e a little flushed,” mother explained
to him, “but you don’t feel feverish. So try
and go to sleep if you can hoav, and we'Jl
poultice you and give your chest a nibbing
later on. And perhaps you’ll be all right
in the morning. I’ll leave the door open so
that you can see the light if you Avant it.”
Dave wasn’t sorry Avhen she left the room.
His conscience was reproaching him.
“I hope to goodness we’re not going to
have him sick on our hands the same as avc
had Bill last winter!” mother reflected, tak-
ing her place again beside dad.
“He’ll be all right in th’ mornin’, woman,”
dad answered.
INEXPERIENCED.
“You know your conduct is quite awful A young widow shouldn’t behave like that!”
“Well, how was Ito know? It’s the first time I’ve ever been a widow.”
“He m-m-miglit ha’ hurt his-s-s-self hop-
step-an’-j-j-jumpin’ at the’ plough with th’
Hanleys,” Joe observed thoughtfully.
“ Wh-a-t /” And dad glared around the
paper at him.
Dave, who could hear from his room, sat
up quickly in the bed and put his best ear
forward.
“With the Hanleys, Joe?” mother ques-
tioned kindly.
“Y-y-yes ; an’ D-D-Dave fell.”
“He fell f” mother echoed with concern.
“That’s what it were, was it!” Dad threw
the paper down. “At his dam’ games instead
o’ work!”
Dave clenched his fists, and longed for a
grip of his little brother.
“It would only be for a few minutes while
the horses were resting, I suppose,” mother
suggested soothingly.
“They were r-r-restin’,” Joe agreed, “but
it was for 1-1-longer than minutes. When
d-d-dad was away li-h-helpin’ Andersons, if
was.”
Dave ground his teeth.
“No wonder,” dad stormed, “that he took
such a dern long time ploughin’ that bit o’
ground! He should ha’ finished a week ago!”
“An’ y-y-yest’day”
“That’ll do, boy!” and mother silenced Joe
with a nudge.
Dave lay back to await the worst, expect-
ing dad to interrogate him, and broke into
a fresh fit of coughing.
But dad went straight to his bed; and
when he had dragged off his boots and
dropped them heavily he called to Joe to
“have the horses in early in the mornin’.
I’m goin’ on with the ploughin’, not him!”
* * * *
Next morning.
The poulticing and rubbing had little effect
on Dave. His cough was Avorse, if any-
thing, and the pain in his side had shifted
to his head. Still, he felt he should get
up and try to do some of the work—he
couldn’t lea\ r e it all to dad. But when
mother refused to hear of his getting out of
bed, and Sarah reckoned he’d bring on a
relapse and be laid up for weeks, he rolled
back wearily and lay with closed eyes, look-
ing as if his end was near.
Then mother made gruel, and cooked
dainties to tempt his appetite; but, though
hungry as an old horse, Dave Avaved a feeble
hand and turned from it all.
“You’ll have to try and eat something,”
mother pleaded, “to keep your strength up” ;
and suggested other delicacies. But Dave
only shook his head and sighed.
“I don’t know what avc are to do for him,
I’m sure!” she lamented to Sarah over
the washing-up. “He can’t get better if
he doesn’t eat!”
Joe stole into the sick-room. He asked
Dave how lie was.
Dave made no answer. His only feeling
towards Joe was one of violence. Joe sur-
veyed the buttered toast, and the tea, and a
soft-boiled egg that were beside the bed with
the eye of a hawk.
“Don’t y’ w-w-want all this, D-D-Dave?”
he asked.
“Dave wanted every morsel of it, and
more, but remained silent.
“Well, if y’ don’t, I’ll h-h-have it.” And
Joe got busy.
“By c wipes!” Dave growled, forgetting he
was ill. “You’re a glutton, you are !”
< “But you’re too s-s-sick to have it, ain’t
y’?” and Joe dexterously curled his red
tongue roung the egg-spoon.
“How d-d-did y’ get s-s-sick, Dave?” he
asked.
“Not th’ way you told him!” Dave raised
himself to his elbow. “Cripes, you’re a
liar /”
“But you w-w-was liop-s-s-step-an’-jumpin'
with th’ Hanleys,” and Joe started on the
tea.
“I didn’t fall an’ hurt meself. did I?”
“You m-m-miglit have, though?” Joe col-
lected the crumbs and dropped them skil-
fully into his wide-open mouth.
Sarah coming to the door called: “Here’s
this Joe worryin’ Dave, mother! An’ he’s
eaten all his breakfast!”
“He d-d-didn’t s-say he wanted it,” Joe
explained, and with a sigh of contentment
went out.
“And we haven’t another fresh egg either,”
said mother. “Never mind, we’ll kill a
chicken directly, and perhaps Dave will eat
a little of that.”
“Would you, Dave?” Sarah questioned.
Dave, who had disappeared beneath the
blankets again, thought he might be able to,
and expressed a desire to sleep. Sarah left
the room on tiptoe.
But Dave didn’t sleep. The voices of dad
roaring at intervals to the plough horses;
someone’s dray or spring-cart rolling past;
hens cackling; calves bellowing; a chicken
sqawking; Sarah commanding Joe to wait
till she got away before he cut its head off-
all these things kept him wide awake. He
also heard old uncle inquiring after him in
whispers, and proffering some of his own
cough medicine as a cure —a mixture he
brewed from gum-leaves and indigo; and
once he fancied lie recognised Mrs. Ander-
son’s voice advising mother not to leave it
too long before sending for a doctor. Dave
was relieved when they weren’t brought in
to see him.
But later, when Sarah came gliding in and
warned him that Lil was outside talking to
mother, Dave took his worst turn.
“The room isn’t very tidy if mother brings
her in” —and Sarah set to and put some
lightning touches to it.
Then their voices were heard on the veran-
dah.
“He won’t eat a bit for us,” mother was
saying, “and I have tried him with every-
thing. But he might take something from
you, Lil.”
Dave’s heart beat fast. His eyelids
quivered, and one hand fell out of the
blankets and hung lifelessly over the bed.
“Here’s Lil, Dave,” mother announced
tenderly.
“Eh-h? Worra yusay?” Dave without,
opening an eye or moving a muscle gurgled
dreamily.
“It’s Lily —come to see you, Dave,” Sarah
echoed.
“Whershe?” and he rolled the whites of his
eyes round, remindful of a dying calf.
“Here I am, Daave —doncher know me?”
Lil whimpered. “I’m beside yer.” She
dropped to her knees, and lifting his life-
less hand, stroked it fondly.
Mother signalled Sarah, and both glided
opt.
Dad, wild-eyed, perspiring and panting,
came in.
“Ain’t he all right yet?” he bellowed.
Mother indicated that someone was in
with Dave, and silenced him.
“Yer know me neow doncher, Daave?”
Lil drooled.
Dad gazed at Dave’s room door, and saw
a pair of heels tapping rhythmically together.
“Oh, it’s her, is it?” And with a grim
smile showing in his wilderness of whiskers,
he strode out again.
* 5jC * *
That night Dave ate everything that was
brought him, and looked for more. And next
morning he was up and about, whistling and
singing, long before the birds.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
In what solemnity and lofty state
He passes slowly through the jostling
crowd,
Nor heeds the careless glance, the voices
loud
Or low. The calm aloofness of the great
Is his, so still and stately in his shroud,
Of this poor world perchance compassionate.
These have no care for him. Their little day
Is filled with anxious thought, as to and
fro
In feverish pursuit they come and go,
Of money, health, success. He does not stay
His leisurely departure; moving slow,
Deliberate, serene, lie goes his way.
Unheard the din; on his untroubled ears
There falls no sound of bells or passing
feet,
Of slowly-turning wheels, or measured
beat
Of hoofs. He has forgotten time and tears,
Secure now in the knowledge sure and
sweet
That lie has wakened from the dream of
years.
Alone, in silent dignity, among
The flowers he leaves the city of his birth,
Its transient sorrow and its trivial mirth.
No need has he of solemn requiem sung,
Nor should the tolling funeral bells be rung,
For he has passed beyond the things of
earth.

Information Sought.
How is strychnine used with thistle-roots
to voison rabbits? —1673.
Cut off the green thistle stalk two inches
from the ground. With a circular cut make
a cup in the stalk and drop therein a few
grains of strychnine. Replace the portion
cut out. The method is tedious, but higlily
successful.
Can you give me a simple recipe for tanning
kangaroo-skins? Is there any wattle-bark in
S.- IF. Queensland suitable for tanning? —-
1660.
Soak and wash thoroughly in clean cold
water for 24 hours, and over a founded sur-
face carefully scrape the back of the skin
with a blunt instrument to remove fat and
flesh. No sodium or lime to be used. It
would probably be difficult to obtain a good
tanning bark in S.-W. Queensland, but as
all wattle-bark contains tannic acid local
wattles will do. Strip the young bark and
prepare two lots of liquors, preferably in
wooden casks. Fill with bark and water in
the proportion of 51b. to 5 gal. and 51b. to
10 gal. Put the skins in the weaker liquor
and allow the other to stand. Every day or
oftener for a week move the skins about, tak-
ing the bottom one to the top and so on.
Wash and scrape thoroughly. Then put the
skins in the strong liquor for a week, treating
as before. Again wash and scrape the backs.
It is impossible to say how long the tanning
will take, not knowing what strength of
liquor will be obtained. Test by cutting a
nick in the end of the skin ; if there is a
streak of greenhide in the centre tanning
must be continued. Finish off with a much
stronger liquor for about two days to firmly
set the hair. Then wash in clean water for
a <* ay or so and dry in a cool, draughty
P la ce. Kangaroo-skins usually tan out of
shape, and it will be necessary to rub a little
oil or animal-fat in the back, stretch back
to normal shape, and nail out on a table or
waU for the final drying.
(l)Ef a shed is 20 ft. wide with lift, walls
loiifj 'iixxtst it &c xtt ovdev to hold 40 tons
°f loosc clia ft ? ( 2 ) How lon o wiu hose
chaff keep in good condition if stored in a
damp-proof shed?- 1657.
(1) As a ton ot bagged chaff occupies a
space ,xsx Sift., and as loose chaff would
OCC 7/ P° ss ?bly 20 p.c. more space, the walls
would require to be 42ft. in length. (2)
() n the assumption that the storage shed is
secure against damp and mice and other
pests, there seems no reason why chaff
should not keep for years, provided it is
properly matured before cutting. Experts
consulted have used three-year-old chaff,
which opened up prime.
What is the largest station in Australia..
and is its area greater than that of the
British Isles 9 1662
Victoria River Downs, N.T. Its area is
13,060 square miles—almost twice as large
as \y a les. The area of the British Isles is
121,633 square miles.
/ have growing near Sydney a custard-
apple tree which flowers 'freely but bears
no fruit. Should it be pruned? —l474.
Perhaps the conditions under which the
tree is growing are to blame. Trees grow-
ing so far south as Sydney do not usually
carry much, if any, fruit. Grafton (N.S.W.)
Experimental Farm found that Pink’s Mam-
moth was the only one worth growing. Only
sufficient pruning to keep the tree evenly
balanced is recommended, and, perhaps,
thinning slightly if the tree is very dense.

flax-seed be used for feeding cows 9 (4) Is
the seed oil-producing? (5) Will’flax grow
on new land? (6) Is there any difference
between hemp and flax? (7) Is flax-growing
profitable in Victoria? 1558.
(1) Districts where the spring is cool
aad moist and with a rainfall of upwards of
26m.. with a good seasonal incidence, are
suitable for production of good fibre Where
plant is grown for seed only, districts with
a rainfall of from 18in to 20in will do
Most suitable soil is free loamy or chocolate
with a well-drained clay sub-soil Good
potato land is usually well suited for flax,

Early sowing is advisable—the most suitable
time in Vic. being from mid-April to mid-
May. though this may be varied according to
locality and conditions. (3) Yes, but it
should be used only in small quantities
(4) Used for production of linseed oil. (5)
Yes, provided it is not sour. (6) Quite
distinct. (7) One flax-mill is operating in
Victoria —at Drysdale. Get into touch with
the proprietor. Meggitt’s (26 King-street,
Sydney) are interested, and would, we
believe, advise you.
What points should be observed, in select-
ing a Dorset Horn ram for fat-lamb breed-
ing ? —1704.
In selecting a Dorset Horn ram the. main
feature is compactness —weight without
height. Badly-bred Dorsets tend to lanki-
ness and are leggy and slabsided. Select a
ram with strongly-developed horn (denoting
masculinity), wide chest, wide breech, well-
sprung ribs and short coupling, level back
and square and compact over all. Density
of covering is desirable, but if fat lambs
are the objective conformation is the main
point, so sidestep the leggy type. A well-
developed ram should weigh upwards of
3001 b. live weight. They do better in dry
country than any of the other mutton breeds.
You cannot do better than purchase from one
of the well-known S. Aus. studs
(1) Can you recommend a good book on
poultry-farming? (2) A good dry mash for
growing stock and laying hens? (3) Will
feed be dear next year? —l66l.
(1) “Poultry Farming,” by James Ilad-
lington. (Govt. Printer, Phillip-street, Syd-
ney.) Price, 4s. 3d., post free. (2) See leaflet
on" “Rearing and Feeding Poultry” (posted).
(3) It is not possible to say yet, but unless
the dry weather in N.S.W. and Queensland
breaks soon prices will be higher.
In Hints for the Farm (It. IS/8/’27)
“E.W.” says “On no account mix duck and
fowl eggs in the same tin of waterglass.”
Why? —1675.
Owing to the difference in quality and the
oily nature of the shells of duck-eggs, the
eggs of fowls and ducks should not be placed
together. Fowl-eggs will retain their flavor
and keep much longer if separated.
(1) flow many times a year docs the rab-
bit breed? (2) Average number in a brood?
(3) Period of gestation? (4) If kept in
confinement icith proper facilities and fed
plentifully on green feed, ivould they breed

elapses before the young breed? (6) At
what age do they reach maturity? —l6s9.
(1) In good seasons a rabbit may breed
four times a year, but usually it breeds
twice. (2) Four. (3) 31 days. (4) Yes.
(5) Four or five months. (6) Five months.
Is Tabor, a mount in Victoria, after a
native word?- —1524.
Vic. Dept, of Lands and Survey advises
that the name was probably given locally,
and was derived from the scriptural Mount
Tabor.
(1) Ts there a school in Sydney where 1
could learn farriery? (2) If so, ivhat is the
course? (3) Fees? (4) Text-books? —1640.
(1) At the East Sydney Tech., Darling-
hurst. (2) History of Farriery, Anatomy
and Physiology of the Foot; Principles of
Shoeing; Diseases of the Foot; Surgical
Shoeing and Practical Shoeing. (3) Seniors
taking one term: Ss. for one lesson per week,
16s. for two lessons and 20s. for three les-
sons. For the course (3 terms) one lesson
per week, 205.; two lessons, 405.; three
lessons, 50s. Juniors, half rates. (4) Hunt-
ing’s “The Art of Horse-shoeing,” Dollar
and Wheatley’s “Horse-shoeing and the
Horse’s Foot.”
I ivant to set up as a dealer in postage-
stamps. How do I go about it? —1596.
Established postage-stamp dealers such as
J. H. Smythe, 121 a Castlereagh-street, and
F. Hagen, 114 Castlereagh-street, Sydney,
will sell you large parcels. An advt. stat-
ing that you are open to purchase stamps
will also bring large quantities. There is
not much in the game for a newcomer. It
takes many years to make a connection and
to accumulate sufficient stock to trade profit-
ably. Many of the present-day concerns are
only now realising on purchases made 20
years ago.
(1) Can I be put out of my Sydney sub-
urban shop while I pay rent? (2) Should the
owner build a new shop in place of the pre-
sent one, can he charge me £6 or £6 10s. per
week? (3) Have I the right to re-occupy the
ncio shop?- —1560.
(1) The Fair Rents Act provides that no
order or judgment for the recovery of pos-
session of any shop, or for the ejectment of a
lessee therefrom, shall be made unless some
rent lawfully due from the lessee has not
been paid, or for one of several other reasons
(such as the lessee’s conduct being such as
to constitute a nuisance) set out in the Act.
A lease for the purposes of this Act is coiir
strued to be every letting of a shop, whether
oral, in writing or by deed. (2) The Act
is confined to shops at a rent not exceeding
£6 p.w. (3) That a shop is required by its
owner for the purpose of demolition or recon-
struction is a ground recognised by the Court
for the recovery of its possession by the
lessor. You have no claim to the occupancy
of the new shop.
What value would these publications have?
Henry Lawson’s “When I was King”
(1905), “ Humorous Verses” (11 >00), “Send
Round the Hat” (1907) and “The Romance
of the Swag” (1907). Also G. Essex Evans’s
“The Secret Key and Other Verses” (1906).
—1632.
Would not bring any more than published
price at the most, though they may rise later
in value. Sydney booksellers would pay
from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per volume for them.
I employ a young man, 21, permanently as
a general farmhand at 41s. 6J. a week.
Gan he drive a header at harvest or must he
be given 18s. 6 d. per day? —l6oo.
The Industrial Registrar states that the
Agricultural Employees (N.S.W. State)
Award, published October 27,1926, prescribes
£2 15s. per week with keep for a permanent
farmhand, and 40s. per week with keep for
a youth aged 20. During harvesting the
rate for the driver of a header is 18s. per
day with keep. The award provides also
that farmhands doing harvesting work
shall receive harvesting rates when so em-
ployed. For the purposes of departmental
administration it has been the view that the
provision that farmhands doing harvesting
work shall receive harvesting rates when so
employed is limited to the permanent or
casual farmhand, and does not apply to
youths covered by the scale of wages headed
“Rates for Youths.” There is some ground,
however, for saying that if a youth of 20
years employed permanently drives a
header during harvesting time in a claim
before an Industrial Magistrate an order
might be made for the payment of the rate
of 18s. per day with keep. A variation of
the award was published on September 16.
under which the rate for the driver of a
header was increased, as from September 1.
to 18s. sd. per day with keep; and the rate
for a permanent farmhand to £2 17s. 6d.
per week with keep.
How arc furred skins taimed with sul-
phuric acid? —1636.
Under no circumstances should sulphuric
acid be used to tan furred skins. This acid
is used as an assistance to the ordinary bark
tanning for sole leather, and would com-
pletely destroy the heaviest furred skin. A
process for tanning calf skins which
appeared in the Service column on Septem-
ber 1 is ideal for any class of light skin.
On what principle are the frets placed on
musical instruments ? —1622.
A. E. Smith, violin-maker, of 68 Hunter-
street, Sydney, tells us that the fretting of
the fingerboard of various instruments is
carried out as follows: The position of the
first fret is found by dividing the distance
from the bridge to the fingerboard nut by
18; for the second fret measure as before,
but from fret No. 1 to the bridge instead of
from the nut to the bridge; divide by 18 to
get the distance of fret No. 2 from fret No.
1. Then measure from fret No. 2 to the
bridge, and divide by 18 again as before, for
fret No. 3; and so on until all the frets are
marked, the distance between them thus de-
creasing with each one.
What is the amount of prohate on N.B.W.
estates of the following value, the property
and money being the proceeds of a commer-
cial business-— £25,000, £50,000, £BO,OOO and
£100,000?—1500.
On an estate of net value £25,000 the N.S.W.
duty would be at the rate of p.c. and for
the other amounts 10, 13 and 15 p.c. respec-
tively, The Federal duty is assessed on the
net value of the estate less the amount of
N.S.W. duty payable. The rate of duty is
a graduated scale commencing at 1 p.c. on
estate not exceeding £2OOO, with an addi-
tional one-fifth p.c. for every thousand
pounds or part thereof up to 15 p.c., and a
rebate of one-third of the duty is allowed by
the Federal authorities in respect of pro-
perty passing to the widow, children or
grand-children of the deceased person. The
value of an estate for duty nurposes is taken
as at the date of deceased’s death, and in
arriving at the net value of the estate all
debts due and owing by the deceased at the
date of his death are allowed as deductions.

Consider the
Battery in the
“DAGENITE” case
As a battery—a battery that WORKS—
the P. & R. is wonderful. Something
extra —something extraordinarily good—
you get in the P. & R. is its “Dagenite” case.
“Dagenite” is a patented, fireproof, acid-
proof, leak-proof, weather-proof, almost
unbreakable material. It looks like
ebonite. But it’s many times as strong.
You need no crate around it. It neither
rots nor corrodes. It will resist jolts, jars
and crashes which would reduce ebonite
to splinters.
And that is not all about the P. & R.
Every piece of it—plates, separators, lugs,
terminals, connectors, paste, the whole
thing —has been made to do its job. The
P. & R. is a BATTERY.
Before you buy any battery, write for
special booklet to Direct Factory
representative, John Arnold, Degreaves
Buildings, Degreaves Street, Melbourne.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The A.J.C. committee, which has been
very unfortunate this year in the matter of
weather, must have thought its luck had
turned when the clouds wnich had brought
rain in the dark hours of Saturday morning
made themselves scarce soon after the sun
came out, and all danger of a wetting ceased
for the day. Nevertheless, the very first
race at Itandwick was inauspicious, for seven
hurdlers came down —one fell on the flat and
the others stumbled over him —and four
jockeys were hurt, one of them rather badly.
In the result two 20-to-l chances, Bungarley
and Mountaineer, divided first place; Bun-
garley’s div. on the 10s. tote was £9 3s. Gd., and
Mountaineer’s £3 15s. Gd. The machine now
pays 50 —30 —20 p.c. without a first deduc-
tion of the amount staked by backers of
placed horses. This is less unsatisfactory
than the Government’s first attempt to im-
prove things, but the foolish business of
declaring three divs. when there are eight
starters has been retained, with the result
that grandstanders who toted Limerick in
the Spring Stakes lost Is. Gd. on the deal.
There were 17 starters in the A.J.C. Derby,
and they were a fair average lot, with two
or three above the average. It was 4 to 1
the field early, but Winalot and Merry Mint
firmed to 7 to 2, and from tens Trivalve
shortened to sixes, as also did Statesman;
Sion (10 to 1) was the only other in re-
cpiest. Padicol and Maltfern did the pace-
making for about seven furlongs, Winalot,
Merry Mint and Sion being close up. At
the half-mile Winalot had the lead, and lie
shot into the straight first, on the rails.
Sion tackled him, and was beaten off; then
Merry Mint threw out a challenge, which
was likewise unsuccessful; finally Trivalve
came strongly, and though the overtasked
Rossendale colt struggled on with a gameness
that everyone must have admired, he was
defeated by a neck. Black Duchess (20 to
1), emerging from the ruck with a fine run,
deprived Merry Mint of third place, being
two lengths behind Winalot; Statesman —
last early—was fifth and Glenariff next.
Trivalve is a robust chestnut by Cyklon—
Trey; lie is the first Cyklon to win a big
race. E. E. D. Clarke, in whose colors he
races, bred him, and collected £6901 from the
A.J.C. as owner and £400 as breeder. Two
veterans from the Cabbage Garden shared in
the honors of victory—James Scobie, who
got the colt into perfect condition without
saddling him up in public since the autumn
—he was certainly the fittest horse in the
field —and Robert Lewis, who, though nearly
old enough to be Davidson’s grandfather,
fairly out-rode him at the finish. Lewis has
always been a favorite with the Sydney
crowd, and he must have been, gratified at
the reception he got. Still, Winalot was a
good thing beaten. If Davidson hadn’t been
in such a hurry to get home his mount
could hardly have lost. The race was run at
a sound pace, as witness the time- 2mm.
33sec. ....
A feature of the bettins' on the Epsom
Handicap was the run on The Bulletin s
selection, Vaals. Twelve to one with most
of the bookmakers when the crowd arrived
on the course, and 16 to 1 in places, the son
of Valais —Galtee Queen was backed so
spiritedly by owner Moss and other fol-
lowers of Fred Williams’s stable that he was
at sevens a quarter of an hour the
race, and sixes was the quote “returned.” At
the same pi’ice were Gothic (2 to 1 in pre-
post betting), Aorangi and Mullabawn;
Amounis was at 7 to 1, Fuji San at S to 1
and White Fang at 16 to 1. Pigeon Pie, for
whom there was some demand at 20 to 1,
reduced the field to 15 by bolting three times
round the course and being declared a non-
starter. He looked better than he had ever
done before, and might have got a place
had li e behaved. But he could not have
beaten Yaals. That commanding chestnut
had the easiest win since Beauford’s in
1921—“ he gave me an armchair ride,”
said Jones, the jockey. Jumping out
as smartly as any of them, he lay
in behind Fuji San and White Fang
till they were well in the straight; then
Jones let him go, and the race was over.
The judge made it “three lengths,” which
could have been easily doubled; the watch
showed Imin. 38$sec. —excellent for a track
which was not fiery, as in past years. Mak
Siecar (100 to 1), on the extreme outside,
was second, a neck in front of Gothic; then
came Wedding Eve, Bunkum and Amounis.
Aorangi got away last and remained in that
position throughout. It: was explained that
lie had a cold.
Murillo, one of the Metropolitan favorites,
was withdrawn from the Spring Stakes. “My
horse has done his preparation,” said Eric
Connolly, “and chasing Limerick and Pan-
theon with uine-stone-odd on his back would
be no good to him or me.” Less w r ise were
the connections of Horton Gag, who appar-
ently decided that it would be a good oppor-
tunity to give their nag a winding-up gallop
—this although he had done a power of
racing and was giving Limerick Sib. He
actually paced it for the champion for nearly
a mile. The effort to shake him off evi-
dently took something out of Limerick, for
the Maorilander did not come home with
his customary ease; on the contrary, it took
him all his time to beat Pantheon, who,
conceding 91b., went under by a mere neck.
Bacchus was a fair third ; Pilliwinkie, who
is apparently a light of other days, was last.
Limerick went out at 4 to 1 on and Pan-
DOG’S LUCK.
DEADBEAT (who has been given a penny) : “’Ad a good win at the
tin-ares, Missus?”
tlieon at 9 to 2 against; the 12 furlongs
were run in 2min. 33|sec.
Heavy rain upset Metrop. calculations on
Monday. It occasioned the withdrawal of
Pantheon, whose owners decided that it
would be better to wait for the Melbourne
Cup than race him with 9st. 111 b. on a
sodden track; the lengthening of Limerick’s
price from 5 to 2 to sevens in places—he
came back to fives —and the advance to favor-
itism of Murillo, who went out at threes.
Valparaiso, for whom there was a big course
commission, was at eights; Donald had good
support from Newcastle at 14 to 1; Amounis,
Horton Gag, Star d’Or and Tibbie were at
sixteensj to which price Bacchus drifted, the
public realising as well as the stable that
he is no good in heavy going. O’Sullivan, on
Beedos, tried to steal the race, but Horton
Gag paced the field up to him and entered
the straight first, with Valparaiso next.
Disposing summarily of Valparaiso, Horton
Gag tried to come away, and his name was
called, but Murillo settled him after a short
light and went on to win by three lengths or so
from Limerick, who also passed Horton Gag in
the last furlong. There was a gap between
third and fourth, Valparaiso and Donald
disputing that position; Don Panther and
Bacchus were next. It took Murillo 2min.
531seq. to run the 13 furlongs, which shows
what the track was like. Erie Connolly had
to wait a long time for a return for the
money he sunk in Murillo, Mote, Faircroft
and co. when he went to England; but he
has got it all back with substantial interest.
Murillo’s victory was worth £5252 to him in
stake-money, apart from wagers, and he
hasn’t to pay a trainer. Jockey Bartle’s
percentage was £201 12s., but he would
get a good deal more than that.

Nothing could have been worse than the
weather conditions at the V.R.C. meeting at
Flemington on Saturday. Drenching rain,
aided and abetted by a biting wind, set in after
the first race and lasted the rest of the after-
noon. Backers were consoled by the success of
three first favorites and an equal favorite;
and they were accommodated with twos
Koyal Charter in the October Stakes —an
uncommonly good price, for the w.f.a. con-
ditions suited the Comedy King horse, who
had shown that he was in great form and
had nothing much to beat. At the home
turn he ran past the pacemaking Avant-
Courier (10 to 1) and, drawing away, won
on the bit; Chariot (16 to 1), ridden right
out, just defeated Avant-Courier for second
place; Thracian (7 to 1) was fourth. Dun-
can had the mount, and the time was lmin.

starters in the
Stand Handicap,
10 furlongs, which
attracted the large
field of 23. At the
close of operations
Cairncross, who
had finished im-
pressively in third
place at the Val-
ley, was first in
demand at 9 to 2,
Bombard and
David Garrick
being at sixes,
Finsbury at* sevens,
Three Kings and
Bard of Avon at
tens and Piastoon
at 15 to 1. The
race was run in a
heavy rainstorm.
Seventh Heaven,
who was recently
in Sydney, turned
for home two
lengths ahead of
Noscitur, with
Cairncross, Bard
of Avon and Fins-
bury next; but
Cairncross cut him
down below the
distance and, stick-
ing it out well,
won by nearly his
own length from
Bombard, who, as
usual, finished
stoutly. Tookarby
(20 to 1) was a
good third, Pias-
toon and Finsbury
(hampered a bit)
being next. Caimcross, who is a four-year-
old Woorak gelding, is owned by A. S.
Chirnside and trained by Elwood Fisher; he
carried 7st. 41b., and bis time was 2min.
13£sec. He is in the Caulfield Cup with a
mere 6st. 131 b., and has been successful
over the distance.
For the colts’ division of the first two-year-
old race of the season—in Victoria, that is
—everybody wanted to back E. M. Pearce’s
nice-looking Mollison, a Queensland-bred son
of Seremond —Molly’s Robe, and he finished
up at 7to 4. Jumping away smartly, he was
always in or near the front, and at the end
of the journey he was two lengths clear of
Salzach (Saltash— Reap) and The Cad
(Lucknow —Stage Girl). It was a triumph
for public judgment, as they finished in the
order they were fancied in the betting. The
fillies’ division was just as easy for Maid of
the Nook (All Black —Pendule), who beat
one of Scobie’s in Mistral and another in
Nyainba. The winner started equal favorite,
at 7 to 2, with Ash Queen.
That good colt The Wensum (10 to 1) put
up a slashing performance in the last race of
the day. the Highweight Handicap. He had
lOst. 121 b., and his chance was so lightly
esteemed in the heavy going that he went
out at tens, but he won a great race by a
neck from another three-year-old, Celtic
Cross (also tens), with the s : to-2 favorite
Borrodale a head away. The time was only
Imin. 19fsee., but all the times were slow.

Valais, one of the greatest thoroughbred
sires Australia has known, is dead of pneu-
monia. Imported for the Arrowfield stud by W.
and F. A. Moses, he was bought, when that
establishment was dispersed, by 11. S., A. W.
and A. E. Thompson for 14,000 guineas, and
stood at Widden till his death. The war
gave him little chance to shine on the Eng-
lish turf, though he had seven starts, and
won once, as a tliree-year-old. In his one
season at the stud in England he sired four
winners before being imported to N. S.
Wales. The rest is turf history, as far as
Australia is concerned, for in his five
seasons in Australia he sired the winners
of races totalling £171,970 in value. His
best year was 1925-26, when 58 of his
progeny, including Heroic, Manfred and Vali-
care. won £57,368. _ His greatest sons were
Manfred and Heroic. Both have gone to
the stud in their turn this season—Manfred
in South Australia and Heroic at Tarwyn
Park.

“Don Crew”: When the fifth consecutive
favorite had lobbed home, Isaacstein found
himself about a fiver short of the pay-out;
still, he hadn’t sprung from a race of
financiers for nothing. “Bung yer tickets
in,” he yelled; “I vant ter get on vid der
next raith.” The punters needed no urging,
and soon Isaacstein was taking the tickets
and paying out money with the speed of an
express engine. By the time the “scratcli-
ing-man” arrived with the withdrawals for
the next event the last ticket had been
torn up. The clerk looked at Isaacstein in
grudging approval. “Spare me days, you’re
not too bad,” he said. “How did you do
it?” “Do it?” said Isaacstein as he
mopped his heated brow, “Veil yer dond t
t’ink I’d pay dern mugs tventy shillin’s in
der poundt, do yer?”

“Thormanby”: The municipal racecourse
on Doncaster town moor (B. 15/9/’27 is
probably the only place of its kind that
lias had to be closed down because of the
bloodshed arising from its activities. One
is accustomed to hear of “murder” in con-
nection with some forms of Australian rac-
ing, but in the case of Doncaster it was a
literal phrase. The burgesses had the course
in operation at the end of the sixteenth
century, but betting disputes were so often
settled at the sword’s point that it was
resolved “for the preventynge of quarrells,
murders and bloodshed, the standes and
stoopes shall be pulled upp and imploid to
some better purpose.” This Avas done, and
Doncaster saw no more racing till the course
was reconstituted in 1703.

“Old Jack” : Pistol, last surviving son of
Carbine in Australia, scored another triumph
when his offspring, Pistol Barrel, Avon the
S.A. G. N. Hurdle recently. The old horse
was imported to South Aus. as long ago as
1904. His best year was 1915-16. when he was
represented by 54 winners. To date, his
record is 713 winners, who have earned
£218,595 in prize-money. In the 1926-27
season 24 of his stock won £10,699.

“C.D*.”: Randwick steeds would think it
was raining lead-bags if they had to carry
the burdens the “griffins” hump in China.
The “griffins”—ponies that have never raced
at Shanghai, Kiangwan, Hongkong, Foochow,
Pekin and other forbidden places—range from
12 to 13 hands in height, and all racing is
“weiglit-for-inches.” Ten stun twelve is the
burden a 13-hand “griffin” has to carry, and
as pilots must be members of the Tientsin
Race Club, military or naval officers, or
visitors approved of by the stewards, the
undersized animals often get a pretty rough
spin. Incidentally, a “griffin” meeting is a
veritable racing feast, usually held on four
consecutive days. The first event starts at
noon, and after the fourth race each day
everyone knocks off for tiffin.

THE EARLY BIRD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s fine to be out on the open links
Ere the club-house clock strikes seven,
When the magpie whistles his morning hymn,
And the lark wheels high in heaven _
With the sky still flushed by the dawn s
caress,
Like a maiden newly kissed,
The fairway dotted with diamond dew
And the creek-bed veiled in mist!
It’s fine to be out when the morning breeze
Is potent as rare old wine,
And drink deep draughts of the sweet, pure
air;
But it’s simply superfine
To have a round when there’s no one by,
And never a soul to see,
Or give you the lie when you tell the world
You did it in seventy three!
N.S.W.

Goodyear will
mean Good Wear
In the early part of the nineteenth cen-
tury Rubber was the vexation and
anxiety of the scientists of the day.
They could make it up into raincoats,
gloves and other articles, which would
wear and keep well during Winter,
but with the arrival of Summer the
rubber melted.
After many years of experiment, dur-
ing which he suffered many trials,
Charles Goodyear produced to the
world the process of vulcanisation,
making possible the manufacture of
rubber goods that would wear and
give good service the whole year
round.
Hence even back in that day the name
GOODYEAR meant GOOD WEAR.
Then in 1 898 the name Goodyear was
selected by a company formed to
manufacture rubber goods. In adopt-
ing this name a standard of perfec-
tion was set for the company to follow.
The utmost service had to be built
into the product.
1 his has been the aim of the Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Company ever since
its inception.
That it has achieved its ambition right
throughout its life is evidenced by the
ever-increasing demand for its pro-
duct, until it is now the largest tyre
company in the world —has manufac-
tured more than 100,000,000 tyres,
millions more than any other make.
With the introduction of the NEW
Goodyear Balloon Tyre, with the
NEW-TYPE TREAD, last July,
GOODYEAR, NOW MORE THAN
EVER, MEANS GOOD WEAR.
And now we come to the point where
we look into the future —the time
when Goodyear’s Australian Factory,
at Camellia, near Sydney, will be com-
pleted. One day, towards the end of
this year, the whistle of this plant will
blast forth its clarion call and the first
Goodyear Tyre, MADE IN AUS-
TRALIA, will start to come down the
line.
We claim that Australian workmen
are equal to those of any other coun-
try; the same rubber, the same cotton,
the same methods of construction
and the same compounds, etc., will be
used in making Goodyear’s Australian
Tyres as are used in the Goodyear
Tyre at present so popular in this
country; so, THEN —AS NOW—
GOODYEAR WILL MEAN GOOD
WEAR.

The rain that meant so much to the State
spoilt what had promised to be the best
match of the Vic. League season —the final
between Collingwood and Richmond. Begin-
ning on sodden ground, the game proceeded
through cold, sleety showers that never
ceased till long after dark. Scientific play
was impossible, kicking off the ground being
more effective. But more often than not the
ball was missed, and the players slipped
when turning or slid yards in the mud. So
the thing became a scramble, with the
handiest and most determined side on top.
Starting with the strong wind, the Tigers
achieved 4 points to ’Wood’s 1 in the
first quarter. In the second, ’Wood got 2
goals and 5 more behinds while the Tigers
stood still. At lemon-time the Magpies had
2 goals 9 behinds to Richmond’s 7 behinds,
and, conditions being as they were, the game
was gone. In the last term the Tigers put
on a goal, ending with 1 goal 7 behinds to
‘Wood’s 2 goals 13 behinds —the lowest score
made in a League match for many a day.
Players and umpires rejoiced when the bell
rang and they had done with sliding about,
in drenched, muddy duds, on what was aptly
termed a “fair cow of a day.” So ’Wood
gained its sixth League premiership; it also
boasts, in its captain, Syd Coventry, the
Brownlow medal winner, and in his brother,
Gordon, the champion goalkicker-—97 goals
for the season. The attendance was but
34,551. and the “gate,” £1778 12s. 9d.

The South Aus. football premiership rested
finally with West Adelaide, which prevailed
over North Adelaide on Saturday by 70
points (10-10) to 58 (8-10). West had
been beaten by North the previous week, but,
having won the minor premiership, had the
right to challenge. Its triumph is popular in
the Holy City, as the team has been rather
unlucky since the war.
* * *
The N.S.W. Rugby Union Waratalis had
a couple of good wins last week; they beat
Abertillery and Cross Keys, a combination of
two first-class Welsh clubs, by 13 to 3 (two
converted tries and a penalty goal to a
penalty goal) in the mid-week game, and
downed another redoubtable lot of Taffies in
Swansea on the Saturday. Against Abertil-
lery half a dozen new players were tried by
the tourists; all acquitted themselves well.
The Swansea game was played in torrential
rain, with the ground a quagmire, but the
tourists settled down to the unaccustomed
conditions and won by three tries and a
converted goal to nil, or 11-0. This game
should effectually dispose of the notion that
the side will not be able to mix it with
British forwards on wet grounds. There
were again several new players in the team.
The Waratalis have now scored 98 points to
14 in their five victories, and in defeating
Swansea have downed a side that beat the
second Springboks and lost to the first All
Blacks by a single point.
“Past Grammar”: A lot of the old Rugby
Union brigade will hear with regret that
Tom Pauling, one of the finest forwards
Maoriland ever produced, has died in a Syd-
ney hospital. Tom got his first M.L. cap
against the Queenslanders at Wellington in
the famous “water polo” match in 189(5, and
came over to Australia with the All Blacks
of the following year. That, team is still
acclaimed as the best that ever left the shores
of the Shivery Isles. Staying in Australia,
Tom repped for N.S.W. in 1899. lie was
a referee in subsequent years.
“Past Grammar” : In a weighty pronounce-
ment on the Waratalis, an English expert
points out that “the Australian method of
checking opponents who are coming round the
scrum by swinging out the arms at full
length is illegal in England, and rightly so.”
I concur with my learned brother. The
thing is too apt to attract the attention
of the “ref.” Here, both in Union and
League circles, we have always preferred the
■short-arm hook. The Waratalis have evi-
dently grown careless.
“Past Grammar”: The English, Rugby
Union has received an invitation from
Mnorilaqd to send a team to the Dominion
in 1930, and has forwarded it to the Inter-
national Board with a recommendation that
the invitation be accepted for an All-British
side, if possible, and that several games be
played in N.S.W. The last British side
to come this way from the Rugby Union
was the Anglo-Welsh team of 1908. It
played 9 matches in N.S.W. and Queens-
land, winning 7 and losing 2. In Maori-
land the side won 9, lost 7 and drew one.
The draw was in the second Test Match
at Wellington. Maoriland won the first
by 32 to 5 and the third by 29 to nil.
s*, * *
“Gate” : The Rugby Leaguers did not wind
up their season without having to endure
another snub from their betters. Having
submitted tamely to the repudiation of the
agreement not to buy each other’s leading
players, the Australian organisation ex-
pressed the hope that its humble request for
an invitation to England, refused last year,
would be granted as regai’ds 1928-29. The
bosses at the other end have intimated that
they can’t possibly be bothered' that season,
though they will see what can be done in
1929-30. Nothing like keeping these
colonials in their place, clioom!
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The attendance at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night was an improvement on that of
the previous week, when an Australian was
meeting an alien. The attraction this time
was supplied by Yankee Phil Krug (list.
41b.) and Afrikander Bill Harms (list.
21b.). Harms had been suffering from the
prevailing influenza and did not hit with liis
usual precision and weight; but as long as
his condition lasted lie had the better of
the argument. In the seventh he pasted
Krug from all angles, and finally sent him;
crashing to the canvas with a hook to the
point and a punch to the mark that snatched
his wind. The bell saved the wily veteran.
But Harms had gone weak from lack of
condition, and lie lost the opportunity of
finishing a dazed opponent in the eighth.
Thenceforward Krug collected points by
means of straight lefts to the face and heavy
rights to the ribs, but it is doubtful if he
made up Harms’s long lead, plus that prac-
tical knock-out in the seventh. However, he
got the verdict.
* * * *
“Mitt Shover”: Maoriland heavyweight
Tom Heeney cruised round Sydney and
Melbourne some years ago begging vainly for
a Stadium engagement. He had to betake
himself to the North Queensland sugar
country to pick up a precarious living at the
game. The same Ileeney knocked out Maloney,
a front-rank Boston heavyweight, the other
night, and is now matched with Sliarkcy.
The winner is to meet Dempsey, and the
DEAD-HEAT.
JACKY: "Them silly cows ought to know neither of ’em can plurry well win.”
conqueror in that engagement will fight
Tunney. llconey must smile grimly when lie
thinks of his experiences in these parts and
of the Stadium policy of preference to coons.
* * * *
The turbulent weather had something (but
not everything) to do with the very sparse
attendance at Melbourne Stadium on Satur-
day night: it was the smallest crowd that
has offended the mercenary gaze of visiting
grapplers since the boom began. Karasick,
getting to work briskly with headlocks, had
Miller so weak by the second bout that the
pinning of liis shoulders was an easy matter.
But the American recovered, and made it
level-pegging in the fifth with a tame-looking
arm-bar. In the next he put the Russian
down flat with a short-arm scissors; then the
small crowd melted out into the night.
The Ins and Outs
“Kingsland”: In anyway, the
good do not always die young. A shining
instance is Sydney Barnes, perhaps the
greatest of English trundlers, who, at 52. is
still playing regularly for Staffordshire. He
is getting the wickets, too, and seems to have
lost nothing of the mastery of flight and
pace off the pitch which made him the most
feared of English bowlers in Australia dur-
ing the first 30 years of the century.
“Shrewsbury”: Australia will see another
example of the leg-theory bowler if Jupp
comes this way next year, as is very probable.
Not so much advertised as Root, who gave
the last Australian XI a bad tinre in their
match with the North of England, Jupp is a
right-hand medium-pace spin bowler. He
pitches the ball on the wicket, breaking in to
the batsman, and has seven fieldsmen on the
leg side. He has been very successful, and
as he is a high-class batsman to boot might
make his mark in Australia. About the
last leg theorist of note we had here was
F. R. Foster, who came with “Plum’' War-
ner’s victorious side of 1911-32. But Foster
was a lefthander, and nearer fast than
medium.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip” : Hanson Carter, one of the
greatest ’keepers Australia has had—he was
born in Yorkshire —has made up his mind to
pull out of active cricket. The little chap
with the silver-grey hair is a year short of
50. but has lost little of his old wizardry
with the gloves, while his batting was very
useful in club cricket last year. He suc-
ceeded big Jim Kelly as the official first
stumper in 1907-08, when A. O. Jones was
in charge of the visiting Englishman, though
he had gone to England as Kelly’s under-
study in 1902. For some reason he was
not selected for the 1905 visit to England,
Newland of South Aus. taking his place.
After that, he was Australia's first stumper
till Oldfield supplanted him as No. 1 in
Armstrong’s side of 1921. Armsti’ong, how-
ever. had the veteran standing up in four
of the five Tests, only giving the A.I.F. star
a flutter in the final game, when the result
had been decided. . In spite of liis lack of
stature and reach. Carter was a splendid
’keeper, particularly sure on the leg side,
that brie noir of the fraternity, and unri-
valled on a “talkative” wicket. As a bats-
man, he scored 776 runs in 21 Test matches,
with an average of 25.03.
Sydney grade cricket made an inauspici-
ous "start last Saturday, for wickets damped
by Friday night’s rain were drying under a
bright sun, and most of the batsmen were,
very much at sea. Exceptions were young
A. Callaway, who hit up a lively 72 for
Marrickville, and Charlie Macartney, who
got 56 for Gordon against Mosman at the
latter’s new ground, and also took 2 wickets
for 19. The best bowling figures were sup-
plied by another old ’un, Merchant, of Rand-
wick. who sent five Waverley batsmen back
for 34 runs with his fast-medium off-breaks.
McNamee, last year’s inter-State discovery,
was also on the spot for Randwick, with 4
for 26, including Alan Kippax, the Waver-
ley score reaching only 71. Marrickville,
with 253, put up the biggest total of the
day, against Northern District, which has
lost no wickets for 2. Paddington, with 249
(Rowe 56), is also well up on ’Varsity (3
for 24). The pouring rain on Sunday night
and Monday settled all chance of playing
the second round in one all-day match, as
was intended.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot" : The Australian tennis heads
have appointed Norman Brookes, Gerald
Patterson and F. Peach to pick a team for
the next Davis Cup competition. Stout old
lads! We all were beginning to think they
were asleep for good.
“Baseline”: The spirit of sportsmanship
seems to be better developed among JN.o.v .
tennis controllers than among those in
charge of cricket. The recently-published
itinerary of the Frenchmen in Australia did
not include a game in Queensland ±lie
Bananalanders have written to the Ma State
asking for backing in having a visit to
Brisbane arranged, and the Sydney execu-
tive has instructed the N.S.W. delegates to
the Federal body to do their best to meet
the Queenslanders’ wishes. It is doubttui
if the thing can be arranged, but the inten-
tion is good.
* * * *
“Bisque” : How hard it is for these cham-
pions to know when the time lias come tor
them to tap the mat! Tilden, the greatest
tennis-player of his time, has found a master,
just as did our own Norman Brookes. Is ne
downhearted? Far from it, worse luck tor
the younger generation of American players
—men like Hennessey, who gave Cochet a
father of a hiding the other day. 1 Aden
announces that his services are entirely
at the disposal of the United States ’ it the
tennis authorities of that country desire to
send him to France in an attempt to recover
the Davis Cup. He is obviously talking
out of his turn. The next American team
will have to be one of youngsters, it
the U.S. hopes to take back the Cup; for,
apart from the Frenchmen, Australia will
probably field a young and vigorous entry.
Tilden and Johnston were beaten by the
“spread” which comes with the years.
Better if Tilden bowed to the facts, and
retired on his laurels.
Car and Cycle
“Bushing”: The motor reliability trials
held recently by the R.A.C. of Australia, in
conjunction with the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
Automobile Club, were for cars divided into
three classes; they covered petrol consump-
tion, hill-climbing, slow-running and accelera-
tion. The outright winners in the three
classes were F'. M. Beck (900 c.c. Fiat) in
class A, G. Schrader (1509 c.c. Alvis) in
class B, and It. Cobden (3874 c.c. Willys
Knight) in. class C. This car scored full
points, heading its class in every test and
the final —a result of which driver A. Turner
has every reason to be proud. The total
points allotted for the competition were 150.
In class A the winner scored 144.50; in
class C the figures were 136.98.
* * * *
“Pore du Chemin”: A wonderful long-
distance run has been put up by a Yoisin
car, with an eight-cylinder sleeve-valve
engine, on the Montlhery track, near Paris.
The car, with three drivers taking turns at
the wheel, covered 2740 miles in 24 hours,
averaging 114 m.p.h. An effort was made to
beat aviator Lindbergh’s long-distance flight
record; however, the Yoisin was pulled up
after covering 5000 metres in 27hrs.
This works out at 3125 miles, the hourly
average being 113.6 miles. As Lindbergh
was in the air for 33 hours 31 minutes while
covering 3350 miles, honors may be said to
stand easy as between ’plane and car. Five
new world’s records were made by the Yoi-
sin : 1000 miles, 81ir. 54min. ssec.; 2000
kilometres (about 1250 miles), lllir. 3min.
54sec.; 3000 kilometres (about 1875 miles),
16hr. 29min. 42sec.: 2000 miles, 17hr. 43min.
Bsec.; 3000 miles, 26hr. 31min. 52sec.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Brisbane, denied tin-hare gamb-
ling, continues to drive dull care away by
going to the motor-cycle races. Last week,
to quote a local journal, “there were 13
falls and some unusual incidents” at one
meeeting. The tally of falls Cannot be re-
garded as an “unusual incident” from the
Brisbane point of view, but the fact that
four riders hit the dirt in one flop may be
considered to warrant the expression. Among
the other unusual incidents were the post-
ponement of the rest of the meeting because
of the casualty list, and a mile race between
a cyclist (Jack King) and a trotting mare
(Highwood Lass), with a standing start for
the man on the bike and a flying start for
the animal. King won easily by 12 yards.
Plis time was 2min. 23 l-ssec.; the mare
took 2min. 24 4 ssee.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: The strange inertia which
seems to clog the activities of everyone con-
cerned with the selection of Australia’s
Olympic representatives has not passed over
the cycling authorities. Having given the
choice of a road-cyclist very leisurely con-
sideration, the Sydney authorities sagely 1
decided to hold a trial a few days after the
gruelling Goulburn-Sydney race. The folly of
this having been brought home to them, they
resolved to ask Victoria and Queensland if
they would mind being represented in an
Australian test, to be held in N.S.W. The
Victorians are willing, but, so far, nothing
has been heard from Queensland. The other
States have apparently been ignored. It is
now proposed to have the test on October 29,
over a course of the same length as the
Olympic run, 116.8 miles. As the race will
be run in Holland, which is as flat as the
Nullarbor Plain, a good hill-climber will
probably be selected.

“Skyrider”: There are bright spots even
in Canberra, where life is at times inclined
to drag. Strolling down the hill past the
golf-links at the rear of the Hotel Canberra,
I stopped to watch a party of three hard-
worked civil servants driving off from the
first tee. One was evidently a master, for his
ball sailed beautifully into the teeth of a
stiff breeze, landing just where it would
do most good in the next shot. A hardy
toiler picked up the little white globe. There
was a yell from the trio near the tee, but
Bowyangs waved his hand reassuringly.
“Save yuh cornin’ over for it,” he bawled,
and pitched it back. Considering the trouble
he had taken, the language used by the golfer
was utterly inexcusable. I have heard some
famous bullockies of the day, but they
couldn’t have out-sworn that wearer of plus-
fours. Fortunately, the wind carried the out-
burst across the Molonglo, and the son of the
toil, brightened by the feeling that he had
done his fellow-man a good turn, pursued his
journey.

breakaway from the Q.G.A., but only an
association to control our North Queensland
championship meeting and any other special
competition. Clubs will still be affiliated
with the Q.G.A., an indispensable body
which has clone a great deal of good for
golf in Queensland. Further, there is no
controversy between Townsville and
Charters Towers as' to which club is the
older, it being recognised that Townsville
has that honor. Not only that, but the
Townsville club claims to be the oldest in
Australia. Since it was established on
January 4, 1893, it has never ceased to
function as a club, whereas southern clubs
formed prior to 4/l/’93 have been resusci-
tated. Townsville has now a full 18 holes
with grass greens, and is always pleased to
welcome golfers from all parts of the world.

“E.K.”: J. D. A. Scott w T as called in to
bunker the Sorrento (Vic.) golf course. His
scheme was too advanced for the stragglers
who congest the links during the annual
meeting. Many took 24 hours to complete
the 12 holes; a few gave up exhausted after
playing the seventh, which is dangerously
near the 19th. Now the course has been
made to suit players to whom time is no
object. Grottoes have been filled in, greens
enlarged and fairways top-dressed. There
are fewer “blind” holes, but this is resented
by some, for the “blind” green has been the
scene of many a celebration. It was on
this Sorrento course that Dr. Lindsay Craig
had a charming experience. He was putting
on the seventh green (better known as “Mi\
Misery”) when a ball landed near his feet.
A second and then a third ball came over,
and as he walked from 1 the green a fourth
rolled close to the flag. This the medico
picked up and placed in the hole; then he
hid in the bushes and awaited developments.
Four players appeared and started pros-
pecting. “I see three balls,” said one.
“Where’s the fourth?” “Here it is in the
hole!” shouted the triumphant owner. “That
gives me a seven. Not so bad seeing I missed
the bally thing three times.”

“Ploughman” : Something of a record has
been put up by Mrs. Gatehouse, who won
the women’s golf championship of Victoria
last w r eek for the fifth time. The lady’s
first success was in 1907. In the interval
she has w r on the Australian championship
twice.

it’s like a misere ’and at solo —the less yer

gadget that sends a cold shiver up me spine
—it reminds of a time w’en I’d ter go pear-
cuttin’ because me partner got up first the
mornin’ after the races. ’Owever, ’e tells
me it’s an “iron,” an’ better f’r a mug than

card an’ tells me ter keep me own score, ’n’
we’ll ’ave drinks on the result. I ’ad a
putrid time, mos’ly on me' own; but tve
comes ter the finish at larst. “Not too bad,”
’e says. “I done that round in a ’undred
an’ one, an that’s some clarss fer a limit
bloke; w’at’s your figgers?” I’d bin readin’
about a champeenship game, so I looks ’im
straight in the eye an’ yaps “Seventy-six.”
“Seventy h ; —l,” ’e comes back, narsty.
“W’at’s the game, anyway?” “W’y, goff.”

Miscellaneous
"Lee Helm”: Inter-State sailing matches
in the 18ft. division may be dropped. The
18-footers began with matches between
N.S.W. and Queensland in 1895 ; before that
the two States had many a battle with the
now-vanished 22’s. Westralia came in in 1907,
when Aeolus won for the lads on the Swan
River at the first try, and the Jarrah State,
with Queensland, has had a fair share of the
honors since then. But the expense of taking
the crews and the boats across the continent
is an increasingly serious drawback. It has
always barred Queensland from visiting the
West, and the Westralians from having a fly
at the Mark Foy Cup on the Brisbane River;
and the abandonment of the fixture —as a
yearly event, at any rate —is being discussed
in Sydney.
* * * *
“R.E.” (a former champion) : Touching
swivel rowlocks, “Ivoolanga” (B. S/9/’27)
had his leg pulled when someone told him it
was hard to get the hands away or the
blades out cleanly. Had he used swivels he
would know better. I have used them with
satisfactory results. Victoria tried swivels
in an inter-State race and was successful;
with poppets its blades and hands have not
come away since. Westralia used swivels
twice and won easily. Mercs (Vic.) won the
senior fours at Henley-on-Yarra with swivels.
An oarsman with a reputation second to that
of no man in Australia told me that of all
the eights, fours and pairs at the Olympic
Games only two crews had poppets; one was
Australian. He saw all the races and became
converted. Imagine poppets on a sculling
boat. Absurd, of course. Then why shouldn't
poppets be absurd on a crew boat? Absurd
they are; but it is hard to convince people
lacking rowing brains.

“Don Carew”: Banana Joe and Finger
were playing flv 100. “Your fly seems to oe
gettin’ a bit restless,” said Finger pointing to
the wall, where Banana’s fancy was shaking
its wings violently. “Not him,” said Banana.
“I’ll go you another dollar he stays there
longer than yours.” “You’re on,” said
Finger; “it’s money from home.” Barely
had the wager been made when Finger’s
fly hoisted itself ceilingwards and flew
away. Rising disgusted!" from the table,
Finger kicked over his chair and also de-
parted. He was a bad gambler. “Well,”
said an onlooker to Banana, “that fly of
yours is certainly a sticker. I wouldn’t
mind betting he’ll stay there for another
quarter of an hour.” “Certainly he will,”
said Banana, who was gathering in his
winnings; “he’ll stay there until I take
him off. I glued the cow to the wall just
before Finger came into the room.”

“Splash”: The American swimmers in
Japan made hacks of the opposition till
Takaishi arrived on the scene. In an exhi-
bition 800-metres relay at Nagoya they beat
Japan and Australia in 9min. 38 4-ssee.,
which is a long way better than the 9min.
53 2-ssec. put up by the American team at
the 1924 Olympiad—and that was a world’s
record. Takaishi took the 100 metres in
59see., finishing ahead of the Americans,
Laufer and Crabbe. This is 1 3-ssec. worse
than Johnny Weissmuller’s world’s best and
3 4-ssec. better than Pun Kelahoa’s Aus-
tralian figures put up in 1921. Takaishi also
got away with the 200 and 400 metres free,

“Ike Mcßagg” : If the dog-racing craze in
England has done nothing else it has glad-
dened the heart of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The revenue from horse-racing
was a long way from the estimate, but the
tin hare came to the rescue. There are 1000
Tommies operating at what was once the
White City, and many of them are the big
men from Tatt.’s ring. In Sydney a rush of
liaif a dozen two-bob bets will make a Leger
bagman shorten the odds, if he doesn’t shut
up, altogether. In London you can get all
the money on you’re game to risk. It is
alleged that backers find it easier to spot
winners at the hare-chasing game than on
the courses for horses. If that is the case
the lad with the bag will take care that
super-generosity in the matter of odds won’t
cast the shadow of the workhouse over him.

“Long Dog”: Flannery, K.C., was giving
his version of coursing proper—that is, the
age-old sport, practised from China to Peru,
wherein a live dog chases a live hare or some
similar game—in the N.S.W. case turning on
the legality or otherwise of betting on dog-
JIM SCOBIE, doyen of Australian trainers,
who has a formidable string from Vic-
toria at the A.J.C. Spring meeting.
racing after an electrically-driven imitation
of a hare. The learned Judge professed his
ignorance of coursing. He asked counsel
if coursing competitions were restricted to
two dogs. The K.C. replied that this was
so, and explained that the idea was to “make
the sport as humane as possible.” inasmuch
as the hare would have a better chance of
getting away with her life than she could
hope for with more dogs chasing her. For
the information of my learned brother, I
should like to mention that greyhounds are
slipped in couples after a hare because the
result of the course is judged on points. A
dog may gain the hare at the finish and yet
lose to his rival who has piled up points by
turning and similar feats not apparent to
the uninitiated. If a dozen dogs were re-
leased at once, as is the custom in dog-racing
after the tin hare, it would be quite impos-
sible to keep track of the points. In open
coursing that difficulty might be avoided by
leaving the final decision till the kill was made.
Modern coursing, however, is carried on in
enclosures which permit an escape for the hare
tricky enough to beat her pursuers. That is
why the ancient point system is still adhered
to, and explains why the devotees of coursing
proper refuse to consider the pursuit of the
mechanical contrivance as coursing, as it is
understood and practised all over the world.

“Joystick”: A red-headed English young-
ster who began his working life as a junior
railway clerk has achieved the distinction of
having travelled faster through space than
any other animate thing. He is Flight-
Lieutenant Norman Webster, who won the
international Schneider Cup for seaplanes at
Venice last w-eek. This year the event was
confined to the Italians, holders of the Cup,
and the British; America, which has figured
prominently in past contests, did not enter.
The course flown is 217-1 miles, but it is
triangular in shape, and the sharp turns are
deadly dangerous. Webster took only 46min.
20.2Sscc. to cover the distance, or 281 miles
756 yards p.li., a rate which staggers the
imagination. Another British representative,
Flight-Lieutenant Worsley, was second, his
time being at the rate of 273 miles 171 yards
p.h. The three Italians had to descend
owing to engine trouble, as also did one of
the Britons, F. L. Kinkead. He was steer-
ing. or trying to steer, a Gloster biplane;
•his two mates were in supermarine Napier
Mono’s. These, fitted with the typical small
British engine developing amazing power,
carry their petrol in their floats. One of
the Italians, Flight-Lieut. Guazetti 1 , had
done six laps in fine style when obliged to
retire; his countrymen, though naturally dis-
appointed, gave the victor a great reception.
Webster was a private in the British infan-
try during the war. and got his commission
as a one-pipper in the Royal Air Force, when
he was only 7 18. He is 27 now, which is
fairly old as airmen-stunters last.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“The Hound”: The live advertising man
doesn’t miss many chances. An Australian
shirt firm erected a display case on the
Windsor (Vic.) railway platform, but
some bad lads smashed the glass and
abstracted the contents. Next day a large
notice appeared in the shattered showcase:
“Burgled! Any risks taken to secure shirts
of our quality!”
* * * *
“Rawson”: In a recent N.S.W. “art
union” prizes to the value of £3OB0 —
practically 80 per cent, of the prizes
enumerated —were imported. In a smaller
lottery prizes amounting to £1445 were
foreig'n goods. Why not Australian goods
for Australian “art unions”? An Austra-
lian-minded Attorney-General would make
this a condition of granting the lottery
license.
* * * *
“Hamer”: An importer who has been
fined heavily for defrauding the Customs
has faith in the honesty of women. He got
a lot of valuable furs ashore free of duty
by inducing skirted passengers to wear
them. He arranged a dinner at which the
ladies attended and handed back the goods.
Not one of them failed to turn up. Had
any of the furs been kept by the wearers, he
could not, of course, have informed the
police.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: I am always expecting to
hear of a big coal discovery at the head of
the Richmond River (N.S.W.), which would
be very convenient for the new railways.
Years ago when I used to fish and swim in
the upper parts of the river, we got big
junks of coal from the water, and every bed
of sand was thickly mixed with Hakes and
lumps of it. I don’t know anything about
its quality, but there was evidently a big
seam of it somewhere in the neighborhood
of Mount Lindsay.

“Percy P.”: Another example of leaping
land values was given by the sale of
Gladswood, a picturesque Sydney suburban
home built 70 years ago. W. H. Kelly, long
time M.H.R. for Wentworth, made it his
home, but sold it 15 years ago for £lO,OOO.
Spencer Brunton, the purchaser, resold it
only a couple of months ago to E. H. Maas
—who had its subdivision in view—for
£45,000. One of the water-frontage lots at
the subdivision sale the other day went up
to £97 per foot; and Brunton bought back
the house itself for £lB,OOO. The total
reached £68.407.
t- * * *
“Barracouda”: If the inter-State Fish-
eries Conference, presided over by H. W.
Gcpp, of the Development and Migra-
tion Commission, has done nothing else it
has served to stress the fact that, with seas
teeming with splendid food fishes, Australia
imports fish —not only tinned but fresh and
cured —to the value of £1,500,000 p.a.
Little South Africa sent us £lOO,OOO worth
last year, all of it of a quality inferior
to our own sea-food. Gepp talks of estab-
lishing marine biological stations. Some-
thing" of the sort may be necessary, but as
in the case of Australian wattle-bark the
Afrikanders did not wait for the Govern-
ment to clear the ground.

“Butfat”: Maoriland’s attempt to fix
butter prices in the Old Dart last year was
foredoomed to failure. She supplied less
than a fifth of the butter Mother consumed,
and couldn’t swing the market with it. Her
average price slumped worse during the 12
months ending June last than those of any
other supplier. And when price-control was
abandoned on March 14 the management
was incautious enough to tell Tooley-street
that it intended to deluge the market with
accumulated stocks. The price dropped 13s.
a cwt. at once, and didn’t climb back to its
March 14 level for a couple of months.
Australian, Argentine and Danish were
involved in the downfall, but that didn’t
help the Maoriland farmer.

“M.G.S.”: For decades travellers hav;
been returning from the tropical paradises
adjacent to Australia’s North full of the
wonders of native rice culture. According
to these experts the secret lay in the Asiatic’s
ability to live on twopence a week and his
alleged habit of unremitting industry. Also
he has grown rice from the dawn of time, and
so must know all about it. The Australian,
with his inexperience and his high standard
of living, could never hope to compete.
Then a N.S.W. State farm put in a trial
crop with the aid of machinery instead of
naked fingers, and the crop was beyond the
imagination of the hardest-working coolie.
The latest reports from the Leeton irrigation
area is that while 2000 acres were planted
last season, this year there are 5000. Also
one pound of the local product is regarded
by storekeepers as equal to one and a
quarter of the imported, and landholders are
changing over from wheat to rice. One of
these days a delegation of Javanese tanis
will arrive to learn something about the
business.

Saturday was another record day at Rand-
wick. The Spring meeting sent its lure
abroad, and from country, city, suburb and,
indeed, all over the continent, not forgetting
Maoriland, home of good horses, came
the expectant crowds. The rain that
had fallen so heavily on Friday night
had put an extra sparkle into the air.
About their State iiixes. were grouped the
G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven, the Chief
Justice Street couple, tli e Tom Hugheses,
skull-classifier Radcliffe-Brown, and the
Harry Budges. Lady Stonehaven’s trig
ensemble was of the new silk fabrics that
glitter with gold thread intersections. Her
hat was large, black, droopy as to brim
and banded in velvet. A steel grey satin coat
with royal-blue facings was effectively
allied to a blue-lined hat by Lady de Chair.
Elaine, who walked about with brother
Graham, sported a snug hat of white felt,
and was a devotee of white pleated cr§pe
de Chine. The Curtis Bennett lady wore
black-and-white with distinction, topped by
a graceful wide-brimmed hat. Hats were
the striking feature of the meeting, the
lightweight felt being affected by the smart-
est dressers. They had a tailored look, and
the only trimmings allowed were a bit of
carpet binding, a few brass or steel nails,
or feathers of the flat-breast class, techni-
cally known as pigeon breast and hackle.
One slightly mixed woman was overheard
calling attention to another’s millinery.
“See,” she said, “she’s wearing one of those
discard hats.” The wearer, proud of her
new Descat, walked on; but, with its
dented crown and the flop in its brim, the
lid really was reminiscent of dad’s old left-
off. Small, flat golden feathers nestled to
the crown of Mrs. Spencer Brunton’s unusual
lint; the intriguing eye-veil shaded the brim
of Mrs. Claude Reading’s navy felt; and
Miss Mona Hay’s grey was softened by the
same touch of Spain. Black and white
enwrapped the Colin Stephen lady. Two of
the most striking frockers were Mrs. Leslie
Walford and Mrs. Malcolm Mackellar, the
first in an alluring combination of black
cloth, green velvet and Belgian hare, the
second in a palely-green ensemble collared in
the same expensive importation. Betty
Willsallen, one of the week’s debs., floated
about in petal pinks. In dove-green softness,
against which sparkled one of the new
crystal posies, Mrs. John McKelvey made
one of the thousands who ascended only to
descend the Jacob’s ladder that leads to the
official stand. Came a little girl with a
sunshade, on which poppies and cornflowers
and daffodils and bluebells raised fluttering
heads (it was a real miracle in raffia) ; near
by was a tall woman holding aloft a blood-red
five-pointed star. Margaret Osborne walked
in radiance and sand-colored crepe de Chine,
her small hat a mixture of straw and felt.
Mrs. Otway Falkiner sported a cowboyish
white felt; Mrs. Dan Kelly mixed calfskin
and black cloth in her smartness. The new
Chanel red flashed in Mrs. John Magney’s
tucked crepe de Chines, and the Belgian
hare collar over which Mrs. Mackins ■ re-
garded the day was one of the most enviable.
The Spring Show was hardly an unquali-
fied success, partly because rain interfered
with the attendance, and partly, perhaps,
because the general public has yet to be
educated up to a Show that doesn't happen
at Easter. Yet there were some really arrest-
ing sections; the display of roses and swefet-
pea was something to live in the memory,
and the needlework had a marvellous beauty
and delicacy. And what can one say of the
cushions underneath their glass covers? On
one a swan of matronly proportions paddled
towards an adipose water-lily that lay
between a clump of pussy-willows and some
tall purple irises. On another a long-tailed
bird of polychromatic plumage stared over a
folded wing at the beholder. A bride simper-
ing above her finery was a magnetic exhibit.
Cakes heavily iced and fruited or plain and
wholesome were evidence of the Australian
girl’s culinary accomplishments, and the ham
and chicken pies were finely imposing.
Garlands of purple wistaria trimmed the
usually prosaic Garrison Drill Hall (Vic-
toria Barracks) for the Cavalry Division’s
dance. Bunting, palms and pennons, with
here and there a lance at rest, completed
the flutter of top-dressing with an Evelyn's
bower of greenery for the orchestra in the
centre. The Gov.-General, with popular
A.D.C. Curtis (“Captain Courteous”)
in attendance, arrived early, and promptly
took to the jazz as the business of
the evening. Brig.-General G. Mac-
arthur Onslow’s tall figure was a landmark
of the party. Colonel Hardie, of the
R.A.G.A., acting-Base Commandant, brought
his pretty lady—-a poem in shades of gold
and green. Brig.-General Bennett was there
with his dark-eyed wife, the latter in the
deep flame tint of a winter sunset. Among
others were Mrs. Lorenzo, in the paler shade
of an apricot; Mrs. Roy Ivingliorn, in a
heavenly tint of azure blue; Major and Mrs.
O’Gorman; Captain Storkey, V.C., and his
wife; Colonel and Mrs. Fraser, herself in
soft, raven draperies; Colonel and Mrs. Her-
rod, who voyaged from Lane Cove for the
event; Major Milton Jarvie and his life-
partner ; and Senator and Mrs. Cox. What
with the brilliant background c.f medals, red
coats and the dark blue and gold of artil-
lery; and Majors Hawkey and McKenzie on
the' list of committeemen, the ball had the
brilliant plumage of a kingfisher’s wing.
A final rush of September brides kept
the Church working overtime last week.
Among the linked-up couples were Margaret
Clarke Penfold, of Turramurra. and her
cousin Norman Eveieigli Penfold, also a
North Shore dweller. The twain were made
one at St. Stephen’s Scotclibyterian Kirk in
Phillip-street, the bride’s dress being of glossy
satin lightly quilted with silver thread and
splashed with crystal. Brussels-lace formed
both the veil and the train of the slender
principal; cousin Gwyneth and sister Jean,
a souffle of petal pink georgette frills and
tulle, frothed along in its foaming wake.
The bride’s parents did the right thing by
the guests, later on, at the Wentworth.
Bede Kenny, just as smiling but hardly
as slim as when he won his V.C. at Hermies,
on the Somme, was married at St. Mary’s
last week to Kathleen Dorothy Buckley,
daughter of the J. Buckleys, now of Five
Dock, but formerly of Nyugan. It was a
very simple morning wedding, and the pretty
bride wore a grey tailor-made topped by a
smart blue hat. Bride’s sister Hilda
’maided and Basil Cook best-manned.
A pictorial group that invaded St. Pat.’s
on Church Hill the other day was made up
of Gladys Plummer, daughter of the George
Plummers of Yarramoor, Scone, and her
three bridesmaids. Old rose and silver lace
built in Early-Victorian curves swirled about
the ankles of the dark bride. Sister Babs
wore pink taffetas of the same period, and
Jule O’Brien’s skirts were like a golden
daffodil, while the ’groom’s sister Muriel
wore tiers of flounces on her turquoise georg-
ettes. The bridegroom was C. L. McDonald,
of Burwood, and the old-established Father
Picquet tied the knot.
A year ago that veteran teacher of sing-
ing, Arthur Appleby, was threatened with
the disaster of having to give up his call-
ing. > Clever surgeons postponed the evil
day, but now the illness has become so
serious that work is no longer possible, so
the sick man’s friends in the musical and
theatrical world are organising a benefit con-
cert on his behalf. It will be held at the
Con. on October 31. Melba has promised
her patronage and sent along a cheque
for #25.
An unusually clever and attractive manne-
quin display of Gilbert and Sullivan charac-
ters, the work of the deft fingers, of Norma
Williams, was
on show in
the Criterion
Theatre win-
dow last week.
The figures
are moulded
from pipe-
cleaners and
“Mo u n t a i ii-
devils,” and are
tailored with
a wealth of
detail in exact
imitation o f
the original
costumes.
Many are
hand - painted
on silk and
satin, and for
the “Three
Little Maids”
the designer
searched Syd-
ney for two weeks to find the exact hues
for the kimonos. Here are the Gondoliers’
tiny red heels and miniature mandolines
and Phoebe Meryll’s spinning-wheel, with
many other of the Lilliputian properties
in which the Mikado group abounds. Besides
excelling in the crafts, Norma has a fine
contralto voice, and has shown herself an
amateur actress of quality with The Players.
Her father is the man who sees to all the
Federal votes being in order on the North
Shore. May Moore made the picture.
The Housewives’ Association has decided
that bread must not be dearer. To save then-
dough, it is suggested that members of the
association, should bake their dough. A lesson
in the compounding of home-made bread will
be given by the president on Thursday next
at the association’s meeting in the Educa-
tion Building.
Passed through Sydney last week on her
way to her home town, Melbourne, Mrs.
Buesst, the first Australian mother whose
son has wielded .the conductor’s baton at
Covent Garden. Aylmer Buesst has a know-
ledge of the world’s grand opera not out-
rivalled by the great Beecham himself; he
has led the orchestral forces cf the British
National Opera Company since its inaugura-
tion. He also acts as understudy to Sir Fred-
erick Cowen, director of the Royal College of
Mus.c, and to Landon Ronald, head of the
Guildhall School of Music. There is an
interesting link between the former and his
mother, for when the great conductor came
to Australia 40 years ago to direct the music
at the Melbourne Exhibition the future Mrs.
Buesst was one of the leaders of his choral
forces. As Miss Pett she w 7 as a noted
pianist and organist of her day.
Michel Maskiewitz (alongside) returns to
his native land after an absence of over 15
years. Before the war the Victorian boy
w e n t to
Vienna, drawn
by the lure of
G o d o w sky’s
name, hi s
burning ambi-
tion Being to
play Bach as
that great
teacher alone
can interpret
that great
compos e r.
When Godow-
sky went to
New York his
pupil followed.
When living
i n a w a r-
racked world
became too
expensive, the
pianist showed
his Australian
adapt ability
by painting stage blackcloths and designing
theatrical costumes —one big show he helped
to deck was “Chu Chin Chow.” Rafael Joseffy
and Godowsky are no mean stars to set a
course by, and these were Masliiewitz’s only
Masters. He has appeared in recitals with
Australia’s old favorite Paul Althous.e, and
has toured with Van Den Burg, now the
solo ’cellist with that august body the Phila-
delphia Symphony. Also, he has lectured
extensively on his art. In Hollywood, w 7 here
he tried himself as a speaker, he had one
class entirely composed of movie stars,
among them Norma Talmadge, Theda Bara
and Eleanor Boardman.
The Boy Scout is not left to waste his
sweetness on the desert air. Sydney staged
two balls to the glory of the bare-kneed
fraternity last week. An enormous muster
was shepherded into the Town Hall for the
benefit of the Catholic branch of the associa-
tion. Flags were lavishly used in the decora-
tions, and a bark hut, the centrepiece on
the official table, turned one’s thoughts to the
jungle life indulged in by the Wolf Cubs
on Saturday afternoons and school holidays.
The Northern Suburbs Boy Scouts were
further heartened for the trial by dancing
hundreds at the Wentworth. The Love dame
w r as the president of this flutter, and an.
armful of primroses and lavender was her*
offering from a committee jubilant over the
night’s success.
The picture “Mons” gave Hoyt’s Theatre
the opportunity of having a vice-regal night,
with the usual result of an overflowing
attendance; the fine British film would be
secure of good patronage in any case, for it
is the best battle picture yet staged. A re-
markable care for detail is in evidence every-
where ; even the German soldiers’ faces are
distinctly German. Three of the “Old Con-
temptibles,” Major H: Sandford Morgan,
Captains E. T. Monies and Gower, appeared
in person with Poilu M. BoiqUat in a pro-
logue, and were given a storm of applause
on their own account..
Aslifield Scotclibyterian Kirk smiled on a
pretty bride last week when Karlene Peters,
second daughter of Thomas Peters of that
suburb, whispered from a swirl of lace and
tulle the vows that bound her for life to
Frank Ludowici, of Lane Cove. The wed-
ding dress, which bore the bride’s monogram
in a glittering design, was a thistledown affair
of frilled white tulle; the veil of Honiton
lace rippled from its mooring of orange-
blossom into a pink-lined cloud of train. A
trio of bridesmaids in spreading organdie
frocks of lilac over almond-green, finished off
with waist posies of real purple pansies and
pale pink hyacinths, were spring-like touches
in the night’s tapestry. The bride's parents
spread the wedding meats in a gaily deco-
rated marquee in the grounds of Mount Joy,
their Aslifield home.
One of the smart young things about town
brought out-back uncle with her to a studio
party the other night. Mixed cocktails fol-
lowed by a wad of Scotch all-round brought
a coo from niece: “We’re not really wild,
uncle —only out for a w 7 ild night!” Uncle
merely grunted. Presently one of the flap-
pers, languidly puffing a fag at the end of
a scarlet holder, shrilled: “Now we are
shocking the old darling, aren’t we?” Uncle
uncoiled his long lean length. “Garn,’’ he
drawled —“that don’t shock me; all the gins
smoke where I come from!”
Some time ago a Bulletin writer men-
tioned the tendency of various industries and
shops in the same line of business to huddle
together. The process can be seen in the
extreme in the Imperial Arcade, which is now
almost an aisle between millinery “salons."
Twenty-four shops battle side by side to make
a crust and a motor-car out of the sale of
women’s headgear in that brief strip of
enclosed thoroughfare.
The women’s committee of the Marrickville
District Hospital rejoiced over its third vic-
tory this season when, trailing clouds of
glory (clothes, not husbands), the fair sex of
the suburb poured into the Wentworth last
week. The job of president fell to Dr. It. B.
Trindall’s wife, and she in black georgette
slashed with gold lame aided and abetted
her husband in entertaining a party that
bristled with medicine men. Treasurer Mrs.
Norton was wrapped in soft black and
white. Impressive green and gold sparkled
on Mrs. T. 11. Kirkland. Blessing this
effort to the glory of his municipality came
the Mayor of Marrickville with his Mayor-
ess clad in poppy golds. The hospital’s
chief Nightingale, Matron Beattie, was
accompanied appropriately enough by Mr. and
Mrs. Lintliall.
Already the days are being earmarked
for summer fetes. November is always a
popular month for these outbreaks, since
they catch the early seeker after the inex-
pensive Christmas present. November 26
will see the grounds of The Knoll, the Albert
Littlejohns’ Darling Point home, turned into
a fair for the benefit of the Crown-street
Women’s Hospital. Lady de Chair is presi-
dent of the committee.
St. Stephen’s in Phillip-street was turned
into a bower of flowering plum by girl
chums of Phyllis Ford, of Murwillumbah.
on the night last week when she assigned
herself for keeps to Henry David Cohen, of
Lismore. The bride, an alluring pink and
white confection, was attended by a maid in
green and silver; Mrs. Peter Roberts, of
Tarago, Phyllis’s aunt, hostessed the recep-
tion at the Wentworth.
Many queer reasons are given for going
into debt, but surely the queerest was put
to the Registrar in Bankruptcy by a Sydney
woman the other day. She justified her
personal liabilities to the tune of many thou-
sands by claiming that the goods bought but
not paid for were only befitting her station
in life, her husband at the time being an
uncertificated bankrupt formerly in the tailor-
ing business! Among the adjuncts neces-
sary to such state she had deemed a Rolls
Royce at £l7OO and frocks to the tune of
nearly £2OOO. Handbags to match were an
essential detail and cost a mere eight guineas
each. Yet many a woman gets gaoled for
shoplifting at Christmas-time when her loot
consists of a few poor toys to fill her kiddies’
stockings!
Pink was the color vibration that tingled
along the aisles of St. Stephen’s last week
when Jean Blackwood came from Wahroonga
to say “I will” to Wiliam Montague
Fowler, of North Sydney. Three maids and
two small trainbearers in roseate chiffons
walked delicately after the bride’s ivory
georgette and lace.
A wide shallow maple staircase, redwood
floors and acres of white ceilings supported
by aisles of square white pillars are the
arresting features of the new home of the
Civil Service Stores. The old landmark in
Pitt-street put out a new sign this week
when the stores were moved, lock, stock
and barrel, around to Lassetter’s old pre-
mises that stretch from George to York
streets. For weeks an army of workmen
and decorators have been remodelling the
arcades of commerce. The passer-by in
Market-street walks over a cellar packed
with sparkling hogsheads of wine and barrels
of whisky. The restaurant, where last Tues-
day an orchestra of 25 (viols, fiddles and
harps) disported under the baton of Alfred
Hill, and where tenor Alfred O’Shea and
Lilian Gibson decanted sweetness, will seat
over 1000. It is sub-sectioned by ruby-red
pile, has polished jarrah floors, and great
square windows through which the light
pours in spite of the towering skeleton of
Farmer’s new corner opposite. The kitchen,
which will feed the thousand, would gladden
an artist as well as an epicure. Tiled,
sparkling with steel and aluminium, it is
set with electric, gas and fuel stoves. Yes.
the most modern chef cooks with coal and
coke mixture. Electric toasters, a sensitive
machine that cuts bread and butters it, too.
washing-up machines and every sort of
known steam gadget stand ready and effi i-
ent as a trained army. There’s a rest-r0.,.)'
where woman can write a letter, smoke a
fag, or renovate her complexion in mixed
daylight and a golden glow 7 diffused through
ornate marigold shades. The carpets here
are greyly blue and the window 7 curtains
velvet the shade of golden plum. Best of
all, there’s a mail-box on the premises where
the letter can be posted, or if you are in
a hurry you can telegraph.

THE name "Romalo”
is an abbreviated
way of saying, "I
want a first-class wine of
good vintage at a reason-
able price.” It is a name
which protects you against
inferiority. It stands for
rare and distinctive wines.

The Flemington race-meeting on Saturday
developed into an aquatic affair, and only
the very fittest of shoes, overcoats, goloshes
and umbrellas survived the ordeal. After
the first race the events were viewed through
a veil of drenching rain, which swept like a
cataract over the top seats of the stands. The
betting area was a sheet of water, and the
McShortoddses sought the congenial shelter
of the public bar, where feminine punters
couldn’t very well get at ’em. Very few
women came prepared for such a deluge,
but the usual winter uniform of top-coat,
felt hats and furs was general. A few opti-
mists came in coats and skirts, and lent a
magpie touch to the gathering, for black-
and-white effects are pushing more gaily-
colored materials off the rag market. Almost
every black coat lapel bore a white camellia,
and some of the younger set even perched the
flower upon black millinery. The Mackey
lady and Mrs. W. M. Robins were among
those who chose black and white. Mrs. Cor-
rie Gardner was accompanied by Margot
Best, just back from her travels. General
Dodds’s daughter was there, too, seeing
Flemington after some years of absence.
Mrs. Charlie Lyon wore black, and Mrs.
Lauchie Mackinnon was a study in brown.
The Laurence couple, just returned from
abroad, Mr. and Mrs. James Purves and
their son, the Richard Lintons, Dr. and
Mrs. Barry Thomson, Miss Mason and Mrs.
A. V. Kewney also braved the rain.
The dinner of the combined Hunt Clubs
at Menzies’ on Saturday night marked the
ending of “yoicks” and “tally-ho” for the
season, and secretary Norman Wood sum-
moned the meet with the last toot of the
horn that will be heard till next winter. As
usual, the men wore pink that ranged all
the way from geranium-red to blusli-rose,
and which sometimes harmonised and some-
times didn’t with the glittering covering of
the Dianas of the chase. Scarlet carnations
—possibly they are “pink,” too, to the hunts-
man’s color sense —made a centre track down
the long tables, with fences of holly at inter-
vals. A huge horseshoe adorned with whip
and l horn marked the place of A. T. Cres-
wick, chairman of .the Associated Hunt Clubs
and joint master of the Melbourne Hounds.
After the meal the time-honored songs—
“ John Peel,” “Drink, Puppy, Drink” and
“The Hunting Day”—did serious damage to
the welkin. Everybody who ought to be
toasted was, from George Rex downwards,
and the only down-hearted note that crejit
in was introduced by Hubert Miller, master
of the Findon Harriers, who said the younger
men were not taking up hunting as they
should, and the time might come when the
grand old sport would have to be left to the
women. A shudder ran through the assem-
blage, but the gloom was not permanent. Dr.
A. E. Byrnes’s wife, who wore a pale gold
lace gown, was accompanied by her daughters
Amy and Ursula; Lieut.-Colonel E. N.
Waters was there with Mrs. Waters, who
wore apple-green with silver; Gwen John-
ston’s frock gleamed in many tones of
mauve; Mrs. H. F. Creswick was in pale
blue with floral tracery of pink and blue
beads; Mrs. R. M. Cuthbertson had coral-
pink and gold embroidery on a white gown,
and Mrs. Embling, wearing a steel-beaded
black gown, was with her daughter Lorna,
who chose lavender-blue and crystal. The
Reginald Power couple were welcomed to
{he annual feast atter an absence from the
State, she being in a sheath robe of black
with steel bugle adornment. Charlie Mitchell,
Melba’s brother, was there with his wife,
whose gown showed two shades of pink, with
silver, and his son Tom, who distinguished
himself lately by travelling round the world
on £4O. The Claude Grice couple, Mr. and
Mrs. C. W. Gavan Duffy and Alison Madden
represented families associated with hunting
in. Vic. since the early days; and the George
Keys, the S. A. Greaves couple and Mr. and
Mrs. F. C. Curtis were there to remain
seated when the toast of the friendly land-
owners was honored.
Some of our nicest and prettiest girls
took part in the mannequin parade at the
Athenamm the other afternoon, the proceeds
of which went to the permanent orchestra
fund. The plush curtain ascended to reveal
a bedroom scene and a charming lass in
bed. The sleeper awoke to a cup of morn-
ing-tea, and while she sipped a maid spread
out lingerie and apparel for the day’s
doings. There followed an invasion of
feminine friends in dashingly ornamental
and Oriental sleeping-suits. From this
start the day of the idle rich was rehearsed,
the programme including golf, tennis, swim-
ming, luncheon and bridge parties, a cabaret
and a wedding. The entertainment was a
credit to the organisers, Mrs. M. Ferguson,
Mrs. Percy Russell and Una Ryan and the
producer, Mrs. George Bell. Especially
coveted were the evening frocks of the
cabaret scene, in which figured Marie de
Bavay, arresting in crimson georgette
bordered with petals of velvet of the same
hue; Lucy Stogdale, a gleam of cornflower
blue, and Ninette Turck, in beaded raiment
of pink. A couple of beautifully-cut black
georgette gowns, with a very little crystal
relief and sash trains, were much admired.
Gorgeous smoking-suits, in the style of the
harem, caused a flutter. Marie Magan,
Margaret Nicholson and a bevy of young
folk danced a ballet, and Wyn Richmond
sang, wearing a frock of white Shetland wool
of lace design. Louise Lovely entertained
the audience between the scenes with
cheerful patter. Dame Mary Cook watched
the show from a box, with Mrs. Herbert
Brookes, president of the Million Coin
Appeal, and Beryl Ainslie, president of the
Junior Music-Makers’ League, under whose
auspices the parade was held.
Those who took part in the mannequin
parade for the permanent orchestra appeal
received a shock when the death of Mrs.
Martha Ferguson, who originated the idea
and was one of the organisers, was announced
on Sunday. When adverse circumstances
compelled her to make her own living, she
went to America and learned the art of
corsetry and, returning, set up business in
Collins-street. Just when everything was
promising well the call came, and a life’s
trek ended at the thirty-fourth milestone.
St. Kilda Town Hall wore trimmings of
orange and red on Thursday night for the
Ambulance Ball. About 500 dancers took
the floor. Between one-steps and Charles-
tons the Totem Boys did their “Rose Marie”
ballet, and the Embassy Eight, _ all
bonny society girls, appeared in a specialty
dance, “Ain’t They Sweet?” attired in
petalled green frocks and silver millinery.
Rose Paterson, the hon. organiser, whose
blue gown was patterned with steel beads,
received many well-deserved congratulations.
Mayoress Morell, one of the vice-presidents,
held a feather fan of sea-green tone over a
gold-trimmed gown of the same shade. Mrs.
E. M. Pearce, also a v.-p., had a glimmer of
pale sequins on her black dress. Amy Pater-
son, likewise a worker, danced in black lace
enlivened with floral tracery. Cornflower-
blue was worn by Sheila Morell, who headed
a committee of the younger set. Newly-wed
Mrs. Norman Barrett sported a pretty blue
frock with a gleam of crystal, and Betty
Shackell attracted attention in glistening
white. Another good-looking lass was Phyllis
Robb, clothed in pleats of pink taffeta.
Adelaide Curtis, of Sydney, wore a blue gown
that reflected her eyes; and Agnes Hogarth,
who hails from the Apple Isle, chose dull
gold lace. Mrs. Jim Fairbairn, Mrs. H. S.
K. Ward, in a black sequined robe, St.
Ivihla’s Mayoress (Mrs. Dawkins), Mrs. R.
M. Cuthbertson, the R. PI. Morton couple and
Mrs. Burnett Gray were amongst the jazzers.
Here is a lady whose popularity has with-
stood the fact that she always has tickets
for sale. She
is Mrs. Barry
Thomson, wife
of a Collins-
street special-
ist. Possessed
of great good
humor and
kindness o f
heart she uses
her gifts to
aid many good
causes. Her
favorite insti-
tution, per-
haps, is the
Alfred Hos-
pital, and she
does splendid
service in ar-
ranging enter-
tainments to
bring in funds
or to brighten
the lot of
patients and staff. She is the president of
the committee that is laying the rails for a
big fete in December. Vandyck made the
picture.
At the Prahran Town Hall the other night
the officers of the Army Service Corps gave
a ball. The colors of the corps, blue and
white, mingled in the decorations with an
array of flags. Colonel D. D. Paine and his
wife, she in a sparkling frock of hyacinth
blue, greeted the guests, among whom were
Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Napier and Major-
General and Mrs. W. A. Coxen and then-
daughters. General Blarney was there with
his wife, whose lemon-toned gown showed a
weave of gold. Mrs. Haines brightened a
white georgette frock with a touch of begonia-
red. Colonel and Mrs. T. W. White, Colonel
and Mrs. Luxton and a whole raft of majors,
captains and lieutenants and their women-
folk were among the dancers.
Another military hop of last week was
that of the United Service Institute of
Victoria at Ormond Hall. Colonel W. H.
Scott’s wife, whose white gown was attached
with shoulder bands of crystal, gave greeting
to the guests with her husband. Rear-
Admiral Napier’s spouse, in gold lace and
tissue; Major-General Brand’s helpmeet, in
black with moonlight sequins; Mrs. A. G.
Paul, in a frock petalled like a red rose;
and Colonel T. W. White’s helpmeet, whose
gown of lettuce-green tone had adornment
of bronze sequins, were among the dancers.
Aileen Taylor, Lucy Stogdale and Joan Lem-
priere were smartly-frocked members of the
younger set.
The nursing staff of the Children’s Hos-
pital took a few hours off on a recent
evening to indulge in the one-step and
Charleston at No. 9. A committee, headed
by Alice West, whose frock suggested a
tropical sunset, had charge of the arrange-
ments; among Miss West’s co-organisers
wer e Carmen Hill, whose red frock had a
sparkle of crystal; Vera Kimber. in a gown
of lemon tone, and Claire Salmon, who
wore gold tissue and lace.
Matron Mary McLean Loughran, of Guild-
ford private hospital, Camberwell, is one of
the distinguished women who received their
training in nursing at Melbourne Hospital.
She saw war
service in
France as
matron of a
hospital in
Paris, and re-

the Luxe m-
bourg. Wear-
ing the indoor
uniform of
Queen Alexan-
dra’s Imperial Nursing Service Reserve, she
represents the British Army Nursing Ser-
vice. Spencer Shier made the picture here
reproduced.
At Melba Hall on Friday night good-
byes were said by the Uni. staff to Dr. Love;
Prof. Rivett, who has been appointed director
of the Commonwealth Institute of Science
and Industry; and Prof. R. S. Wallace, w-ho
goes to Sydney Uni. as Vice-Chancellor.
Miss Love, Mrs. Rivett and Mrs. Wallace —
the last-named is leaving with some of her
children for a trip to Scotland while her
husband gets used to the Harbor City—
received posies. Prof. Scott gave the depart-
ing guests God-speed. Muriel Cheek and
Isobel Biddell made music, and there was
jazz and chat before the evening wound up
with sunner and speeches.
A bridge party at Scott’s the other night
helped the kindergarten sponsored by the
Ex-Students’ Association of Glenazzano.
A hundred tables were occupied. President
Alma Simpson’s old-world frock of apricot
taffeta appeared beneath a bridge coat of
modern fashioning. Mrs. Percy Shelton, in
sparkling blue, and Mrs. P. Cody, whose
black lace frock had a delicate pink lining,
were joint hon. secs., and Gladys Holzer
held the purse.
At the Lyceum Club one night last week
members of the Music Club and their friends
listened to a programme arranged by Rita
Hope, who was at the keyboard for the
two chamber-music numbers—the Beethoven
trio for piano, clarinet and ’cello, and a
Schumann trio for strings and pianoforte.
Miss Hope was associated with Franklyn
Stonham and Helga Brennecke in the first
offering, and Coral Trenerry took part in
the Schumann number. Violet Somerset’s
fine voice was heard in some songs of
Schumann sung in German. Among the
listeners were Mrs. Corrie Gardner, the
Robinson lady, Mrs. Walter Cass and
Margaret Best. Chat and coffee rounded
off the evening.
One evening last week the Harry David-
sons, of Tliornbury, motored daughter Edna
to St. Mary's, where she had an appoint-
ment to meet Vincent Enright at the altar.
Glittering like a frosted maiden in a cloud
of white georgette powdered with diamente,
the bride paced under an arch of white
blossom, and yards of Limerick lace which
formed the train rippled up the aisle behind
her. Three maids, Loretto Enright, Molly
Davidson and Genevieve Jones, formed a
rainbow of color in taffeta frocks of
mauve, apple-green and apricot tones, with
graceful crin. hats to match. After the
knot-tying Mrs. Davidson received the
guests at Chasleton, Toorak, in a smart
black toilette sevffi with silver and coral.
A note of spring was the abundant decora-
tion of pink blossom, and the cake blushed
in unison.
Nancy, eldest daughter of the J. A. Kerr
couple, of Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, married
William, second son of the William Dixons,
of Hawthorn, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral
one evening last week. The bride wore a
sheath frock all crystal and pearls with a
court train of silver, a coronet of pearls and
orange-blossoms, and lots of tulle. The
attendant maids were Dora Maddocks Cohen,
of the Harbor City, who wore buttercup
raiment with adornment of shaded blue
sequins, and Ella Boyce, in pale pink, all
sparkling. Their millinery was of silver
lace. At the Windsor afterwards the
bride’s mother wore a black robe with glim-
mering embroidery, and a black tulle toque.
Lady Bridges, wife of South Australia's
Governor, who is returning to England on
the Naldera, will have music not wherever
she goes, but as far as Colombo. Dame Nellie
Melba, who is on very friendly terms with
the lady, is escorting her to the lair of the
Cingalese.
Melbourne’s former mayor, William
Brunton, and his lady, who have been tour-
ing Europe and America, are on the
Aorangi, homeward bound from Vancouver.
They should return in time to see the Caul-
field Cup run.
Mary Lindsay, whose Westralian land ven-
ture evidently turned out well, warmed her
new house in Berkeley-square with a big
social splash. Her brother, Russell Lindsay,
who arrived in Fogtown lately with a son
and a nephew in tow, is staying with her.
John Gould King has exacted a promise
from Elizabeth Guion, only daughter of the
late T. Guion Thomson, of Connecticut,
U.S.A. The prospective bridegroom is second
son of the E. S. Kings, of Kew.
Margaret Helen Campbell, who lately
became Mrs. K. L. James, will pitch a
moving tent far from cities. Her husband is
one of those engaged in the construction
of the overland railway. After a brief honey-
moon the pair started off to chase the rails
across the Continent.
The Holtz family, after glancing through
Europe, has cast anchor in London while
the head of the family attends the Inter-
national Press Conference,
After several months’ battling with acute
rheumatism, contracted during her Maori-
land tour, contralto Phyllis Lett (Mrs. de
Burgh Ker) is only now making a real
recovery. Maud Burdett, who has been the
guest of the singer during her visit to
Australia, is returning to England next
month by the Narkunda.
Collingwood (Vic.) Children's Court
bloomed with flowers like a theatrical first
night when Mrs. Q. G. Pinkerton, its first
feminine J.P., began her tussle with crime
the other day. The only case listed was a
small boy charged with throwing an orange
at a tram-conductor.
Mona Barlee, of the “Tiptoes” co., will
shortly give up the limelight for the lesser
radiance of domesticity. She is not in the
cast of the new piece, having decided to take
a holiday and get together a trousseau.
Here on her way to interview London
publishers is Mabel M. Hookey, from Tassy.
In a suitcase stuffed with matter for
editorial consideration is a diary of the Rev.
Bob Knopwood, the first sky-pilot who
floated into Van; Diemen’s Land. Miss
Hookey has edited this interesting docu-
ment, and has added copious notes. Besides
this historical treasure she has written the
story of the island’s early homesteads and
has prepared a series of colored illustra-
tions.
No mistake seems to have been made in
awarding a two years’ scholarship abroad
to Violet Kenyon, a student of the new
Con. Her work has so impressed the
musical heads that her scholarship term has
been extended for another year.
Mrs. S. Kroef, whose pleasing contralto
notes have been missed by concert-goers, has
written saying that her absence may be
extended for another year or even longer.
Her young family is getting acquainted with
the father’s country, Holland. Captain
Kroef has been appointed to the first com-
mand of one of a new- line of traders
between Australia and Holland, and when
Mrs. Kroef and her chicks return they will
make the journey in his ship.
Prof. John Smythe’s widow is coming
home on the Penda. House room is awaiting
the wanderer with her old friends the
Grays until plans for the future are made.
Marshall Sumner, one of the star students
of the Uni. Con., who was given a farewell
concert lately on the eve of his departu-e
for America, has already distinguished him-
self over there. He was one of 50 advanced
pupils who competed for a scholarship
awarded by Percy Grainger, and he topped
the list.
The Springthorpes are home again after
18 months of exile in London, and the
authorities of the Tweddle Home are re-
joicing. The genial little doctor’s special
hobby is the upbringing of young Aus-
tralians, and he has been sorely missed by
the institution.

So said a recent visitor to our Works. He was

His Ex. and Lady Goodwin have been in
Toowoomba. Although the locomotive jibbed
on the journey, the hour’s delay was an
opportunity of studying one of the prettiest
parts of the range, and the visit was a suc-
cessful one. The Queen City of the Downs
did itself proud with parties and official
functions. Lady Goodwin, who is a flower-
lover, received some of the most beautiful
floral gifts she has had since her arrival in
Queensland, for Toowoomba has some rea-
son to be uplifted about the violets, daffodils
and primroses it can grow.
Purple and gold, the Goodwin colors, deco-
rated T’woomba Town Hall for the civic
reception, with a tropic background of
palms. Their Exes, went on to the hospital,
picked un a presentation basket of gerberas
and had morning-tea. The Glennie Memorial
School was also visited, and there were
waiting primroses, tied witli purple, red and
gold. Margaret Brown, the principal, re-
ceived their Exes., and Lady Goodwin made
a brief speech.
Primroses and violets were the basis of
the color scheme at a civic dinner in the
Alexandra Caff*, and wistaria twined the
pillars. Motor trips to the points of inter-
est and a visit to Simla hostel for afternoon-
tea were part of the programme.
The Royal Society of St. George gave a
dinner to the vice-regal party. There was
a musical programme, to which Ruth Pasco
and Miss Hassler contributed.
Gladys Han-
cock, who is
to be married
to G u y o ii
Bothwell Mc-
Outcheon, son
of the R. Mc-
Outcheons,
Mel bourne,
is one of
our society
beauties. She
is the only
daughter o f
the J. Henry
Ha n c o c k s.
Scotby, East
Brisbane, and
has just been
touring the
Cold Country
with her
parents, who
are pillars of
the Shak-
speare Society.
Before leaving for T'woomba, their Exes,
went to the races at Ascot on the only really
warn.' day we have had this spring. The
committee had a tea on the verandah for
them, others there being Mrs. Crothers Hen-
derson, Mrs. Meynink and Mrs. C. A. Rae.
Lady Goodwin wore black ninon with hand-
painted roses and a black picture hat. Mrs.
Campbell was in mushroom-tinted crepe de
Chine with cinnamon hat, Mrs. Isaac Moore
wore burgundy and a fawn cloche. Amongst
the throng were the Cecil Palmers, Dr. and
Mrs. J. J. Power and Mrs. Wallis Hoare,
the last-named in bois-de-rose.
Music W eek arrives shortly, the proceeds
to go to the State Ambulance, and day and
night there will arise sweet strains. Hard
upon its heels comes Australian Authors’
Meek, starting October IT, for which com-
mittees and sub-committees have been work-
ing valorously. The old Girls’ Normal School
will be the scene of operations, and Uni.
dons and other literati will give addresses
at evening sessions.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
The cold snap that spread desolation over
orchards and market gardens took the edge
off the Hunt Club racing as far as frocking
went. Georgettes and filmy voiles stayed
snug in their wrappings and femininity gave
winter garments a further term of service.
> ice-regality was there in force—and largely
in sables. Lady Stonehaven wore a sable
coat over a frock of beige cloth; and Lady
Bridges, besabled too, sported a frock of
putty color. The Mayoress and Mrs. Whyte
(her husband is the club’s president) were
furred in black, and Mrs. Gerald Armstrong’s
snug red hat and red leather coat struck the
loudest color note in the vice-regal box.
Dressing on the lawns was mostly sober —
flaming out only in headgear or in some of
the frocks worn by the younger set.
Show Week was also Animal Week, cul-
minating in a fancy-dress ball that left even
last year’s successful effort limping far be-
hind. The setting was a flame and gold
Town Hall; decked with roses and autumn
leaves and the deeper glow of marigolds, and
the dressing was so admirable that the
judges, Mrs. Edgar Brown, Mrs. R. M. Cud-
more and Mrs. Arthur Lewis, were hard put
to it to make their choice. Mrs. Lavington
Bonython as a pink-and-white-striped and
wholly charming Polly Peppermint, Mrs.
Erie Tolley’s black cat, and Mrs.
McSweeny’s Eastern goddess were among
those that caught their eye, and General
Phillips’s special prize for the best set went
to the green caterpillar of Wylton Todd and
some of our younger masculine set. One set
made up mostly of this year’s debutantes,
represented “hags” in black sateen, long of
bodice and full of skirt, white ruffles and
black skullcaps; and a young matron was
a Chinaman to snare any feminine Chinese
heart, with blue trousers, black jacket, pig-
tail and moustache complete. There was
dancing the same night at the Elder Hall,
the last frivol for this season of the Univer-
sity Dance Club.
The Governor managed a glance at the
football finals as well as at the racing, and
in the evening was with Lady Bridges at the
schools concert in the Exhibition. In the
morning there was an investiture at Govern-
ment House, where the University’s Vice-
Chancellor was presented with the regalia
of his K.C.M.G. by the G.-G.
The Naldera, with Lady Bridges and her
daughter and the Gerald Armstrongs aboard,
had also among her passengers the O’Hal-
loran Gileses and the Norman Cloweses, bound
for England, and Mrs. S. H. Skipper and
Mrs. H. C. Nott, with tickets for Colombo.
Show Week has set rolling the ball of good-
bye speeches to the Governor, who follows
his family in December. None of them was
more sincere, or answered more happily, than
that given at a big muster of returned
soldiers.
The Ross Smith statue has arrived, and
will be in its place in Crosswell Gardens
before the end of the year.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The idea of having a queen carnival of
“Miniature Bush Nurses” next month is
giving plenty of work to those interested in
the movement. Little Marjorie Oldmeadow
is one of the candidates, and Mrs. Old-
meadow’s bridge and mah-jongg party at the
Continental in aid of the cause was most
successful. Thirty tables were occupied, and
Mrs. Oldmeadow gave the prizes.
We have broken out into an eruption oi
fairs this month, and Margaret O’Grady has
been kept busy opening them in various
suburbs and country townships.
The performance by the Ilobart Repertory
Theatre Co., under the direction of Olive
Wilton, of Shaw’s “Pygmalion” warmed up
a cold audience —snow was falling outside on
the opening night. His Ex. and Margaret
O’Grady were first-nighters, and the house
was crowded each night. Scenery and dress-
ing were good, and Winifred Collins made a
convincing Liza Doolittle.
Joan, elder daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Hos-
kins, Longford, has promised to walk to the
altar in the near future with Frank Brown,
eldest son of that sporting squire, George
Brown, of Ellenthorpe, Ross, and Mrs.
Brown.
Miss E. Griffin, nat. gen. sec. of the
Y.W.C.A. in Australia, paid us a short visit,
and was given a civic welcome at the Town
Hall by Mayor and Mayoress Wignall. In
the evening there were doings at the Y.W.C.A.
rooms, where the members gave a short musi-
cal programme as a prelude to Miss Griffin’s
long address.
WESTRALIA.
* Perth.
The Hunt Club’s race meeting attracted
many of the smart set, but though we are
telling each other that spring has come, a
cool breeze made tailored suits the favorite
raiment. His Ex. was there, and a pleasant
time was had by all.
The Cottesloe Tennis Club held a suc-
cessful fancy-dress hop the other evening.
The chief organisers were Mrs. H. Evers
and Miss L. Page.
The Old Girls’ League of St. Mary’s
College went a-dancing at St. Mary’s Hall
the other evening. Miss Dannatt, the presi-
dent, welcomed girls and guests, and Sadie
Cockburn, the secretary, looked pleased at
the big muster.
The Caledonian Society’s masquerade ball,
organised by Mrs. R. Fellowes, was a bright
and successful affair. There were pipers to
lead the Grand March and prizes for the
best costumes.
Lady Lawley, who has been revisiting
Perth with her husband, a former Governor
of this State, after an absence of a quarter
of a century, received a hearty "welcome.
They were both well liked. The years have
dealt kindly with her and she is as vivacious
as ever. The pair wall have a look at the
Eastern States before returning to England.
Dorothy Eileen Gordon’s marriage to
James C. R. Bell at Wesley Church last
week had full musical and floral trimmings.
After-rejoicings at the Karrakatta Club
brought along a flock of civil servants.
Marjorie, eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
W. A. Smily, has exchanged a promise for
a ring with Claude Harris, whose domicile
is in South Australia.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill, pictured here by Bard-
well Clarke, is in the forefront of our Sliak-
speare enthu-
siasts. She is a
successful tea-
cher of the
dramatic art
and a valiant
social worker,
but she is
never so happy
as when she
takes the
boards to de-
pict the woes
of William's
most tragic
female charac-
ters. As Lady
Macbeth sh e
can chill the
marrow in her
audie n c e s’
bones, and her
Queen of Den-
mark is far-
famed. She
won the title of Westralia’s Tragedy Queen
years ago, and has upheld it worthily.
Eileen O’Brien, writing from Malacca, says
she has had a marvellous holiday in the
F.M.S. and has been induced to stay another
month, returning to Perth at the end of this
month. Other Westralians jaunting in
Malaya are Peg Kelsall and Kitty Clifton.
They also are due home at the end of the
month.
Mrs. W. H. Robertson, whose only son,
Athol, is at the Naval College, Jervis Bay,
took a run over to see him last month, and
since has been the guest of relatives, Mr. and

TO ARTISTIC CAND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.M.: No use for that model with the swollen
knees H.E.C.: Still a long way behind W.G.:
The same to you E.P.: “Impressions of Sydney
actors drawn whilst waiting in queue outside Cri-
terion” declined 0.K.: Bishop drawing rejected,

E.A.J.: Unsuitable R.C.: Your prospects of be-
coming a cartoonist arc remote.... E.8.C.: The

behind time.
THE INKY WAY.
“Haka”: I reckon I'm Tiie Bulletin's
champion plodder. I sent along my first
attempt in 1908. None of my stuff was
printed till 1915.
“Coot”: Piquant headlines? Wasn’t it
Monty Grover who headed an interview with
the wanning jockey of a Melbourne Cup,
“A Sermon on the Mount”?
“Oxmead”: “H. 11.” (B. 29/9/'27) tells
of a Bulletin contributor who collected
payment for a single word, “Pledgislature.”
I once met a man who assured me he drew
live bob. over .‘>o years ago, for a mere
couple of letters. These w-ere the “f £”
which were destined to replace “L.L.” as
the initials of a bygone Melbourne celebrity
named Smith.
“Lao-dah”: Queer coincidences? The
Manchester Guardian sent a correspond-
ent _ to Falais, in France, w 7 here our late
Allies have been celebrating William the
Conqueror. When the British Post Office
forwarded its account to the paper for its
correspondent’s despatch, the number of
words charged for were exactly 10G6!
“Macabre”: The gentlest of all the rejec-
tion slips I have ever encountered comes
from a recently-reconstructed Sydney publi-
cation :
The editors of the New Triad thank you very
much for your contribution, which, however, not
being exactly suitable, they now return.
The adverb is surely the last word in
soothingness.
“N.Q.”: Undergrowth is an organ of
Sydney art students, published every second
month. Naturally few 7 see it, but it is a
well-designed magazine that is a joy to
handle, and a vigorous expression of youth.
Youth, with its hopes and its compassion and
its angers, very seldom succeeds in becoming
articulate: it usually has to put up with
listening to the clear, cold utterances of
Age. Undergrowth, though, gives a very
clear account of its outlook, and makes you
hope that its producers can draw as well as
they -write.
“Spare Sub”: There was some mild excite-
ment in the newspaper world the other day
when it was rumored that the long-heralded
acquirement of Sydney Daily Telegraph by
the Sun was an accomplished fact. The
story was denied by both parties, but in
such half-hearted fashion as to suggest that
negotiations are entering on the last lap.
The deal should benefit the Sun in many
ways. The evening journal doubtless has in
mind the success Melbourne Herald has
made of the Sun’s own Melbourne bantling,
the Sun Pictorial, w T hich the Herald took
over when the Sydney journal withdrew
from an unproductive field.
“Leo Lear” : The only Victorian newspapers
which have survived from the early ’forties
are the Geelong Advertiser and the Port-
land Guardian. The former is the oldest
printed sheet in the State, having been first
issued on November 21, 1840. James Har-
rison was founder and editor, and J. I’.
Fawkner was behind the enterprise. Over
two years previously Fawkner himself ha !
started a small paper in Melbourne, but thi-
was hand-written. There is some doubt
about the Guardian’s exact birthday, as
the earliest files are missing, but it was in
July, 1842. Thomas Wilkinson was the
first editor. Another Portland paper, th.-
Mercury and Normanby Advertiser.
appeared on the scene soon afterwards; later
it became the Portland Mercury and
Port Fairy Register. At least two other
Victorian newspapers were in existence at
this time, both Melbourne organs: the Port
Phillip Patriot and the Port Phillip
Herald. But all trace of them has long
vanished.
“G.W.Y.”: Sydney dailies have been dis-
agreeing amoug themselves. The Sun fell
out with the S. M. Herald over the ques-
ion of rights to the Lindbergh flight story,
and it had a difference, of opinion with the
Evening News because of the latter’s pick-
ing up from the air the American broadcast
of the Dempsey-Sharkey fight. These and
later developments have led to several defec-
tions from the Sydney Daily Newspaper Pro-
prietors’ Association, and to the formation
of a N. S. Wales Newspaper Proprietors'
Association. This embraces, in addition t"
the Daily Telegraph, Smith’s papers and
the Sun and weekly paper proprietaries in the
Truth and Sportsman and Sunday Times.
The new organisation has been registered
under the N. S. Wales Arbitration Act. The
N. S. Wales District of the A.J.A. also has
been busy with an application under the
Act, directed mainly against Sydney sub-
urban newspapers. The latter are cited to
the number of over GO, but an award will
be meaningless in the case of many which
employ no labor outside their owners.
OUR MUTUAL REGRET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why post me nice polite reminders that
My literary efforts do not suit,
That flowers of thought that bloom beneath
my hat
Just fail to bear remunerative fruit,
That some of my great mental waves are
blanks
That warrant only editorial thanks?
Why post me slips—“the E. in C.
regrets”....
When what I crave is editorial cash?
I’d just as soon have nasty epithets
That flail with criticism’s pointed lash.
Then, hot with anger, on them 1 might hang
That stinging verse that goes off with a bang.
These neatly-printed editorial slips
That come to me pinned on rejected
screeds,
They buy no roasted beef, or fish and chips.
That might inspire to further metric deeds.
If they were fat receipts for me to sign,
Ah, what unending joy would then be mine!
O Editor, if you must needs decline
To let me in your columns fill some space,
To send regrets coincident with mine
Would surely be a gesture fraught with
grace.
Rejection’s pangs I sooner might forget
If you will print “Our Mutual Regret.”

The above illustration shows the path which the oil
follows through the engine. Note the large oil reser-
voir in the bottom of the motor, and that all oil is
screened before passing to the pump. No metallic
particles can pass to the bearings and other parts to
cause excessive wear.

The powerful motor of the Republic 1 ruck requires a lubrication system second *.o
none —a system that will ensure fresh, cool oil being forced to every moving part
of the engine.
Friction is the enemy of everything that moves —it is friction that wears out bearings,
piston pins, rings, etc. —it is friction that reduces speed and absorbs power. Republic full
pressure lubrication forces the oil directly to the heart of the bearings, and reduces
friction to the absolute minimum. Instead of the ordinary splash system, in which hot
oil is simply churned around in the crank case, cool oil is carried in leads directly to the
spot which requires lubrication. Thus all bearings, piston pins, timing gears, etc., are
continually bathed in a constant flow of fresh cool oil, which means longer life for
the engine. A pressure control valve automatically protects the oiling system and
increases the oil pressure in proportion to the engine speed.
Republic lubrication results in longer life, more power, smoother action, and the
elimination of lost time and costly repairs.
Investigate this and other Republic features. Your local dealer will gladly demon-
strate. Models from 1 to 5 tons.

The cast of “The Chocolate Soldier,” re-
vived at Sydney Her Majesty's on Saturday,
is admirably fitted, vocally and otherwise,
and the storv of the combatant who didn't
like lighting but proved a better man than
the heroes moves with mirth and slickness
towards the tuneful finale. Charles Walenn,
as Bumerli, the soldier aforesaid, plunges
nonchalantly into the series of adventures
which starts with his invasion of a lady’s
bedroom while engaged in escaping from
the vengeful Bulgarian troops. For a man
who professes to be frightened of harmful
weapons he shows the minimum of alarm
at prodding bayonets; but possibly he re-
flects that any person who could rig him-
self with such ferocious whiskers as Bernard
Manning'' Captain Massakoff is pretty cer-
tain to be a dud and a false alarm. Strella
Wilson, as Nadina, the lady whose bedroom
is invaded just as she is getting between
the sheets in about twice as much clothes
as the modern flapper wears in the street,
placed herself on good terms with the audi-
ence early by her rendering of the “My
Hero” song; “Winifred Williamson, as
Aurelia, keeps her amorous husband in his
place with a heavy contralto voice, and
Mabel Gibson does brightly in the part of
Mascha, the role which helped Dot Brun-
ton up the ladder of popularity John Ral-
ston's Colonel Casmar Popoff is an amiable
gentleman who combines an iron-grey mous-
tache with a youthful mind about girls; and
the foppish hero, Alexius Spiridoff, repre-
sents flic best work LeoDarnton lias done with
the company, though his acting is not up to
his singing. The revival, which is brightly
staged and colorful, comes to a close on
Thursday of next week. On the Saturday
following a company selected from three of
“The Firm’s” shows will requisition Her
Majesty’s stage for building “Castles in
the Air.”

There will b e a sadness of farewell in the
songs of “The Student Prince” on Satur-
day night at the Empire Theatre (Sydney),
royalty being under notice to quit to make
room for the democratic “Tweekie,” which is
to open on the following Wednesday (Oct.
12) —of course at a gala performance. The
Empire runs to gala performances as a
bookie runs to diamonds. “The Ringer”
continues such a favorite at the Royal after
a nine-weeks’ run that the management has
still not yet fixed a definite date for “The
Music Master,” which is to be Moscovitch’s
next offering. The Criterion has also a
change impending, “Rain” being due as soon
as “Our Wife’s” drawing power begins to
wane.
* 5(5 * *
The Playbox has taken Wedekind’s “The
Awakening of Spring” as its new offering for
Wednesday nights. The new production
falls far below the standard of “Juno and the
Paycock,” and a strong stomach is needed
for appreciation of it. A group of school-
boys, and, later, another of schoolgirls, dis-
cuss the sex-relations about which their
seniors keep them in blind darkness. One
of the boys commits suicide under the over-
weight of mysteries he cannot grapple with:
another, discovering the forbidden knowledge
for himself, is responsible for the death in
childbirth of an immature girl who did not
think she could have a child without being
married. The play finishes in a grotesque
allegorical scene in which the boy, escaped
from a reformatory, meets beside the grave
of the girl the spirit of the dead schoolmate,
which urges him to suicide, and a masked
figure which reminds him that Life is still
sweet. Life wins. There is a large cast; the
acting of Roland Birrell as Melchior, the
youth who finds out things, and that of Mary
Charles as Wendla Borgmann, the far too
unsophisticated g : rl, compel a measure of
commendation.

Another example of the remorseless Ger-
man method of setting forth an argument is
given in the film “False Shame” which is
being exhibited at Sydney Adyar Hall at dif-
ferent hours for the two sexes. Plainly the
film is horrible, and yet it would be hard to
deny that there is some instructional use-
fulness in the illustrations of how certain
diseases may be contracted, and with what
revolting results. There is no music, it is
explained, because the producers of the film
insist on the absence of anything that might
distract attention. So the argument is
bludgeoned home in silence.
For one week only the Kwong Sing Wall
troupe of Oriental miracle-workers are briglit-

bewildering phenomena, goldfish make their

goes on breaking plates at the rate of eight
dozen per week, and from the riotous merri-
ment that ensues one is forced to the con-
clusion that there is something wildly
humorous in the fracture of crockery.

Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney) patrons arc
paying special honor to Stiffy and Mo in
their closing stages. The programme has
been compounded out of the items that have
proved most popular during the rough com-
edians’ 30 weeks’ stay; and every night
boisterous farewells are hurled across the
footlights. Jim Gerald arrives on Saturday.

( An agreeable feature of “Rich Men's
Sonsy’ shown at Sydney Lyceum this week,
is the excision of detail and a restraint
i n . the use of captions. The story deals
with the adventures of a bumptious scion
of a millionaire family with a pestilential
habit of butting into other people’s
business. On the same bill is “Oh, What
a Nurse!” Syd Chaplin gets into the
clothes of one, thrusts the ordinary kind
of house-thermometer into a patient’s mouth,
sounds his chest with a hammer and
examines his tongue with a hot spoon.
Hoyt’s have an entertaining story of train-
ing-camp life, mainly concerned with the
hostility between a sergeant and a recruit,
in “Rookies.” The British war film “Mons,”
which should have had a good deal more
prominence, has been pushed into the
suburbs after its too-brief showing.

The rain was no boon to the Spring Fair
run by the R.A.S. at Sydney Agricultural
Ground ; yet the faces of officials unselfishly
reflected the general satisfaction. The Show
finished on Saturday night amidst the loud
noises of massed bands playing an accom-
paniment to the barking of Show dogs. There
were some spirited contests in the high jumps
on Saturday. Mascot, owned by the Judd
Bros., who have scooped a mass of prizes
and records at many shows, cleared 7ft. Tin.,
beating the previous record by 2in. The
main honors in the woodchopping contests
went to Queenslander L. Appo. A goat-race
was one of the sporting attractions; and one
Bimber, driven by a capable small girl,
romped home by eight lengths from the re-
doubtable Windbag. Altogether the whole fair
was a very interesting display, from the fruit
exhibits to the woman’s handicraft section.
Next year the intention is to hold it a couple
of weeks later in the year.

SYDNEY
PALACE.
Scrubby, the strange steward (B. N. Lewin),
and Mr. Lingley (Reg Wykeham .)
“ Getting Gertie’s Garter” was the con-
ventionally smutty American bedroom or
hayloft farce which Frank Neil introduced
to Melbourne Palace patrons on Saturday.
It contains a comedy butler, who samples
his master’s whisky, a French maid, honey-
moon complications, a reluctant male, an
eager female desirous of being compromised,
and the garter. The garter is comparatively
novel. Studded with diamonds and adorned
with his portrait, it has been presented by
a young man to a lady, and the lady sub-
sequently gets married to another party and
the young man seeks to recover the incrimi-
nating object, which is passed from leg to
leg of the ladies of the cast, but always main-
tains a lead of one leg ahead of the hus-
band. So that the garter can be adequately
displayed the playwright arranges for the
ladies to spend most of the evening in a
state of neglige. After slamming five doors
off their hinges in the first scene the action
or agitation is transferred to a barn. The
barn having only one door to be slammed,
the dramatist provides hiding-places in the
shape of a couple of barrels, a liarness-cup-
board, a motor-car, an oatbin, sundry bundles
of cattle fodder, and what looks like a frag-
ment of a stage-coach in an upstairs hay-
mow. The lady who is screaming to be
compromised resorts to direct actiorf by dis-

robing in the stage-coach, wraps her body
in a horse-blanket and spends the act roll-
ing in the hay or hiding in the oatbin with
the reluctant male. Meanwhile the honey-
moon wife, the donor of the garter and the
French maid, assisted by the alcoholic butler,
get into similar straits down below, until
the wife of the reluctant compromiser dis-
covers her husband, faint 3 and the barn
catches fire.

It will be interesting to see if the dailies
that sooled the police on to “Cradle
Snatchers” at the King’s will do the. same
kind service to “Getting Gertie’s Garter.”
If the King’s show is salted wit, the Palace
howler is pickled in brine. As presented by
Beryl Barraclough, Field Fisher, Mary
Gannon, Leslie Woods, Lily Molloy, Rosa
Duggan, Paul Longuet, Jefferson Tait and
F. Neil, it sounded like an argument between
a stone-crusher and a couple of concrete-
mixers. A well-populated house greeted it
with frequent loud guffaws.
* * * *
On Saturday week will be presented at
Melb. Royal “The Whole Town’s Talking,”
a comedy by Anita Loos, who achieved fame
and reprobation with that artful literary
gem “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” McMahon
will produce the show, and Marie Burke,
Barrett Lennard, Leyland Hodgson and
others will endeavor, unaccompanied by
music, to convince. In the meantime, “Tip
Toes” tapers to an end. Cradle-snatching is
still in vogue at the King’s, and the royal
form of the sport is on view in “Madame
Pompadour” at His Majesty’s. “The Last
Warning” keeps Athenaeum audiences guess-
ing. There is little to report at the Tivoli
except that Hetty King, Edith Clifford and
the Briants are still on the bill and that
the bill is well worth meeting.

Warmth, color and melody are the out-
standing features of the symphony No. 6 in
C minor of the Russian Glazounow, which
opened the programme presented by the Uni-
versity Symphony Orchestra on Friday at
the Auditorium. Under the baton of Bernard
Heinze the instrumentalists showed at their
best in the second movement. Edward
Elgar’s Concert-Overture “In the South” had
its third airing in Melbourne, and diffused
its pleasing air of pastoral innocence. The
performance was somewhat disjointed.
Alberto Sciarretti, who was enlisted about
the eleventh hour to play the Schumann
Concerto, seemed to rather blend his
playing with that of the orchestra than to
try and annex the spotlight upon himself all
the time. Edouard Lambert, the Belgian
violinist, did some graceful artistic work in
the lovely Romance by Wagner and the
Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso of
Saint-Saens.
J.C.W. aren’t the only people who make a
profit out of grand opera. Last year the enter-
prising George English and his Postal Insti-
tute Choir sang “Faust” twice at Melbourne
Playhouse, and it paid them. From October
15 to 21 they are going to repeat the per-
formance at the Princess, and the inclusion
of “Carmen” will raise the event to the dig-
nity of a season. Many of those who heard
Bach’s B minor Mass sung by English’s
crew recently are ready to accept postal-
notes at par.

The grave, the gay, the dramatic, the
pathetic and the merely frivolous are ingre-
dients of the artistic haggis Ilislop has been
serving in his mellow tenor at Melbourne
Applauditorium. The versatile Joseph’s note
of many colors is equally at home in German
lieder, Italian gran’ opera and old English
ditties, but a suspicion grows that the
attempt to offer his accompanist, Mr. Sciar-
retti, as a solo pedaller is not justified by
the results. The other evening this pianist
lost his way in a prelude and fugue by a
person named Sgambati. After scratching
his head for an interval he went on ; but
whether he went on in the right place this
critic doesn’t know. Sgambati’s prelude
was so featureless a composition that he
might have left out whole chunks of it with-
out anybody being a penny the worse. Miss
Doubleday fiddled pleasingly throughout tie
season, which was considerably more suc-
cessful than at least three of the preceding
ones.
H* *l*
Melbourne has another Art attack: —
As a warning to the councils who persist in plant-
ing the thing in every Australian street and public
garden, it is time some artist had the courage to
expose the miserable pretensions of the palm-tree.
Harold Herbert (New Gallery) has just returned
from Noumea with some specimens preserved in
water-color of this vegetable monstrosity, and he has
made the usual attempt to paint romantic pictures of
them. The fact is, however, that the palm is one
of Nature’s indiscretions. The artist’s paintings of
the gum-tree, which botanists place high in the scale
of evolution, expose the hollowness of his palm-trees
once for all. His gums are painted with no strain-
ing after effect, yet they are as graceful and decora-
tive as his palms are self-conscious and ill at ease.
For the rest, Herbert wields his suggestive brush and
controls his fluid wash in 34 pictures with the old
skill.
The latest products of Norman Lindsay’s feminine
stud farm are on exhibition at the Fine Art Gallery
in a dozen etchings and some waters. The Lindsay
water-colors strike the present writer as little more
in them than tinted drawings. To reach the depths
of representational reality achieved by his chief
Art-god Rubens, Australia’s most dynamic artist needs
to take a header into oil. Paddling in the iri-
descent shallows of water-color adds nothing to the
world he has already created with his vital line.
But in line he is supreme. In the present .show the
eye lingers longest in the neighborhood of the
etched illustration to Beethoven’s C Sharp minor
quartet. The mighty Ludwig (or so writer presumes
to interpret the picture) stands with his feet in
the tragedy of the B flat major quartet, represented
by the Lindsay girl in attitudes of poignant grief
and pain, and with his head in the passionate gaiety
of the G sharp minor piece, represented by more
Lindsay girl in joyful mood. The artist has been
severely criticised for introducing literary ideas into
his drawings because intellectual hodcarriers like Sir
John Millais have done the job so badly, but in
this picture N.L.’s triumphant skill gets so close
to projecting music into line that the unbiased eye
is wholly satisfied. With some of the others, however,
it is not so pleased. For instance, the attempt to
depict the horrors of Revolution suggests the leader-
writer of the Age turning an attack of indigestion
into an attack on Bolshevism.

“Rose Marie” left on Sunday for W.A.,
after five weeks in the City of Culture. There
is some doubt whether “Cradle Snatchers,”
the next piece for which the Theatre Royal
is booked, may not prove too strong for local
consumption. At the Prince of Wales,
Muriel Starr is doing big business in the
evergreen “Within the Law,” in which she
made her Australian debut in this city 13
years ago. “Kindlin’ ” is to follow. The
Stud Foley Follies are in their final week
at the Majestic. “Knockout Reilly” is the
fighting picture at West’s, while "Husband
Hunters” proves the ability of the Aus-
tralian actress, Mae Busch, on the screen
and gives chorus-girls tips on the way to
capture millionaire husbands. At the
Wondergraph, “God Gave Me Twenty Cents”
introduces a little waitress in New Orleans;
and in “Lady Robin Hood,” Evelyn
Brent courts death as the leader of a band
of smugglers and bandits. “Twinkletoes,'’
at the York Theatre, gives the London under-
world a spin. Adelaide Repertory Theatre
has just given a three-nights’ performance
of “Sigismund,” a piece by Alex. Symons,
a local playwright, dealing with the lost heir
of a Balkan principality. Th e acting of
Charles Langley, Mrs. Catherine Neil,
Ethelwyn Robin and Wallace Johnstone was
well up to amateur standard; and Wil-
fred Neill deserves praise for the produc-
tion and staging.

How Taxation Has Increased
The first complete year of the LANG GOVERNMENT (1926) resulted in
DIRECT TAXATION BEING INCREASED BY 5/- PER HEAD OF POPULATION
The direct State taxation per head in New South
Wales over the past three years has been : —
1924 .. £3 12s. 4dL 1925 .. £3 12s. 1926 .. £3 17s.
The Lang Labor Government, although it raised the income-tax exemption
figure to £3OO, has increased taxation in other directions. Taxation on the larger incomes
has been increased by from one penny to one shilling in the pound. Company rates were
increased by the 1926-27 Budget from 2s. 6d. to 3s. in the pound. The great majority of
shareholders penalised by this increase are not wealthy persons; in many instances trust
estates are affected and widows and orphans suffer as the beneficiaries.
In Income Taxation alone, Mr. Lang “squeezed” the State last year for £7,859,654,
which was £2,385,197 more than the collections for the previous year. The increased
sums taken by the Lang Government from industry in income taxation during the last
financial year represent —
£1 PER HEAD FOR EACH MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD.
The accompanying tables show the
direful trend of our State finances
as affecting each individual, the figures

In addition the increases in railway freights and fares amounting to 1 0 per cent., at
least, constitute a severe form of additional taxation of the producer, both primary and
secondary.
Mr. Bavin, the Nationalist leader, stated in his policy speech:—
“We are prone to forget that every individual in the community pays taxes either
directly or indirectly, and that we cannot, by attempting to throw the whole burden on one
section, prevent the burden from being felt by all.
“We shall make the adjustment of the financial position our first care, for we believe
that a Government which aims at lightening the burdens of taxation and the charges for
public service, which confines its borrowing wholly to the needs of development, and thus
helps to reduce the cost of production and the cost of living, is giving a more real and
practical benefit to every section of the community, to producers and consumers, to rich and
poor, especially the poor —than can be given by any glittering legislative gifts. A policy
which gives the worker 3d. and makes him pay 4d. for it, in the shape of increased taxation
or cost of living, is a policy not of humanitarianism but of humbug.”

“Caesar’s Ghost”: The habit of giving a
last-moment lift to disheartened stage-girls
who had decided to go abroad seems to be
growing with the J.C.W. management.
Billie Lockwood had one foot on the boat,
so to speak, when the Firm discovered how
useful she was. Byrl Walkley, arranging to
book for America, had a similar experience.
She was rushed to Melbourne to play Trilby
for Moscovitcli, and came back to Sydney for
“Our Wife.” Sylvia Clifton has now been
given that part, and Byrl Walkley has gone
to Melbourne to rehearse Madame Durand in
“Castles in the Air.”
“A TRAGIC TOUCH.”
“C. 8.” : G. B. Post and Dot Brunton are
not the first victims of “The Climax.” That
play has given knocks to so many actors
that it deserves to be classed with the Con-
rad ship that was always killing somebody.
Many years ago Flo Young of the golden
notes put the play on in matinees in Sydney.
She was so pleased with its reception that
she was emboldened to take the thing on
tour to Maoriland. She opened at the con-
cert-chamber in Wellington. The piece ran
to empty houses for a week, and left the co.
on the rocks. Incidentally, it was Sydney’s
reception that encouraged G. Bates P. to
try the thing on Lunnon.
“Santander”: G. P. Huntley’s Eccles in
“Caste,” produced at the New York Empire
in 1910, is highly mentioned in a cutting
which I have before me. He was rather
proud, too, of his Sir George Orreyd in “The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” which he first
did with the Kendalls in America over 30
years ago and revived in a special perform-
ance in New York in 1924. Another role
that was dear to his memory was his Lord
Grenham in “Aren’t We All?” which Dion
Boucicault portrayed in Australia. Com-
monly regarded as an Englishman, Hunt-
ley w r as actually horn in Fermoy, County
Cork. He made his first appearance as a
child prodigy in the Town Hall, Kilkenny.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Pictures with unreal
battle scenes which showed how America
won the war were exhibited in fashionable
Sydney theatres. The‘“Mons” film arrives
a long time after and is shown in a theatre
which, though comfortable enough, is not in
the front rank. Yet “Mons” is streets
ahead of the Hollywood stuff. It is worked
out with such artistic detail that the march-
ing Germans are definitely German in their
facial characteristics, and it has no flam-
boyant boasting—the greatest brag is the
perfectly justified caption setting out that
50,000 Britons held up 170,000 of the flower
of the German army. It arouses new
suspicions about the American control of
our film business to find this fine British
work pushed into the background.
“Coy”: These virtuosi are a grave disap-
pointment sometimes to their press-agents.
Pianist Friedman had two nights to put in in
Melbourne while on his way from Adelaide to
catch his boat at Sydney, and he spent one
listening at the Athenaeum to Kaai’s
Hawaiians. His patrons of the Auditorium
would destroy themselves rather than listen
to Kaai’s Hawaiians.
“M.11.V.” : The first production of “Utopia,
Ltd.” (B. 8/9/’27), in Australia was in Mel-
bourne Princess in January, 1906, by the
G. and S. Repertory Co. The cast included
Howard Vernon, Charles Kenningham, Dolly
Castles, Aggie Thorne and Vinia de Loitte.
The only production in Sydney opened at
Her Majesty’s on September 1, 1906. With
elections in the air the opera would have
been enjoyed at any time _ within _ recent
months, particularly the Utopian Parliament,
as run by the “Flowers of Progress.”
“A.J.P.”: Thirty years ago we ran Sun-
day shows in Brisbane Opera House.
Walter Bentley was one of the principals;
he had to read a portion of Holy Writ, with
spotlight effect. But one night the operator
behaved as if he had the shivers. Bentley
solemnly announced his reading and then,
irritated by the flicker,, growled to the
operator, “Wake up, you cow!” This fail-
ing to answer, he cursed the offender
after every other verse, also without
effect. Finally his anger got the better of
him and, in the midst of a verse, he roared:
“What the hell are you doing up there?”
It was the most popular reading of the
series.
“Goldilocks”: Some of the most success-
ful actors I know make a point of being
merely working acquaintances of the ladies
they meet on the stage. It may not be the
true Bohemian idea —anyway, Bohemianism
on the stage is a back number —but it has
behind it the same principle that impels some
business men to decline to have friends or
friends’ children on their office staff.
“.Cine Ma”: The moving pictures have
brought a new word into the German lan-
guage. In untranslated stickers of the
Teuton picture “Variety,” now showing in
Australia, the feminine lead is described
as “die star,” and Emil Jannings, the male,
is “der star.” Presumably, if Hans discovers
a Rin-tin-tin, he will be “das star.” Still,
this is nothing to the number of words that
fillums have brought into the Australian
language.
“Hamfat”: J. C. Williamson once met
Charlie Kenningham—who, great singer
and actor that he was, owed little to James
Cassius —and delivered a homily upon the
tenor’s obviously festive state. “You know
how this ends,” he concluded. “George
Lauri did it; Harry Sadler did it-—when
are you going to do it?” “I’ll probably do
it,” Charlie answered promptly, “when I’ve
heard your next imported tenor!”
“R.K.D.N.”: Seymour Hicks resents
being considered a funny man solely. All
comedians are the same. Some years ago in
England Hicks carried out a long-expressed
wish —or threat —to appear as Richard
111. Although he used some of Henry
Irving’s props and costumes bis audiences
(what there was of them) refused to take
Hicks seriously, and he soon went back to
the lighter stuff. The public was quite cor-
rect. Hicks is a finished farceur and pos-
sesses a pretty vein of sentiment, but he
is never really happy in a part unless he cau
throw in a gag whenever the spirit moves
him.
“Yarra B.”: Even the managers seem
intent on showing that the policy of import-
ing hordes of actors to play these “great
American successes” can be overdone. In
“Abie’s Irish Rose,” now paying a return
visit to Melbourne, there is only one member
of the original co. All the other . mummers
are Australians, by birth or adoption.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The art of prompting is
on the wane, and the fault of “fluffing” is
increasing. In the days when mummers had
to learn a new part every week there was
some excuse for “fluffiness”; there is none
in these days of long runs. But worse even
than the actor who is not letter-perfect is
the prompter whose voice can be heard well
into the stalls. A man who couldn’t prompt
A FRACTIONAL ERROR.
FIRST AUSTRALIAN (in Paris, passing acquaintance ): “Is
that his better half?"
SECOND DITTO: “No, that’s his Latin quarter!”
all the evening without the audience being
aware of it wouldn’t have been employed by
Williamson, Rignold or Bland Holt.
“Goldilocks”: May Beatty is playing in
“Twice in the Same Place,” which seems
booked for a long run in New York. Her
part is that of a woman who refuses to grow
old and is about to marry for the fifth time.
Incidentally, she is sharing a flat with the
Claude Flemmings—Claude is now engaged
in pictures.
“Flaming Youth” : The man who “makes
the saxophone a musical instrument” (B.
22/9/’27) reminds me of a Sydney music-
shop proprietor who had a new sign put up:
“All Kinds of - Musical Instruments ; also
Bagpipes, Banjos, Ukuleles and Saxophones.”
A Scot who had a share in the business
objected to the inclusion of bagpipes in the
derogatory category. “All right,” assented
the musical man grimly; “if that’s a musical
instrument we’d better say they all are!”
“Spool!”: Milton Hayes, who was fairly
popular in Australia as long as he confined
himself to his inane incoherencies, has been
bumped by the critics in his native Britain
for dragging sloppy sentiment into his turn.
Hayes was addicted to this sort of thing
when in Australia, and a recall for some
piece of fooling was inevitably followed by
ghastly tripe like “The Green Eye of the
Little Yellow Gahd.” Hayes even went to
the length of interpolating short disserta-
tions on social, topics, which were as funny
as his comic stuff, though he didn’t intend
them to be. Now a London critic says of
him that his audiences find it difficult to
switch over from broad comedy and cynicism
to “a mood of emotionalism which is some-
times described as ‘kiss-mummy.’ ”
“Craiser”: While Melbourne Ilepertorians
are rehearsing Franz Molnar’s “Liliom” that
dramatist is engaged on a new play entitled
“If Napoleon .” Boney is represented
as having missed the ’bus and stepped
into a smaller vehicle. Being pensioned off
from the army, he expends his talent for
organisation on a fire-brigade. Instead of
finishing as a great tragic failure he ends
as a comic one. The idea suggests endless
possibilities. Some Australian playwright,
to begin with, might write a drama on W.
M. Hughes remaining an umbrella-mender.
“P.A.Q.”: The producers of the picture
“The Trail of Te Kooti” had a hard job
to find a Maori sufficiently like Te Kooti—
a very small man with a dark beard —to
represent him. After a good. deal of search-
ing they discovered Te Paieri in the wilds of
the Urewera country. Te Paieri, though 72
years of age, suited them in every respect
except that his beard and hair were white.
He was brought down to Whakatane, where
the barber made them jet black. After the
operation Te Paieri gazed wouderingly at
himself in the glass and exclaimed: “Py
gorry that te funny way—l come back to te
young ferra again. So soon Igo back te
pah we have te tangi over that old dead
ferra Te Paieri; I te new ferra grow out of
him.” The film has been taken on the
ground where the original tragedy took place
—the Mill Farm near Whakatane.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) :
A children’s theatre has been
opened in Endell-street, Lon-
don, in what was formerly a
shop; tariff, 3d. to 2s. 4d.,
according to age. The open-
ing hour is 5.45 p.m., and
the programme includes
songs, sea-carols and chan-
ties, a tale by Hilaire Belloc,
a two-act play by Margaret
Carter, and Brember Wills
as chief funmaker. A quar-
ter of a century ago actresses
gave Endell-street a wide
berth on dark nights because
of its cut-throat reputation,
but the locality has long
since been cleaned up.
“Curtain Raiser”: Mel-
bourne Town Hall’s new in-
sides are now almost ready,
and the Auditorium’s two
years’ monopoly of concert
celebrities —a monopoly of
which the owners took full
advantage —is nearly over.
It is to be hoped that the
civic fathers will not revert
to their old policy of grant-
ing long leases to. the winter
procession of imported vir-
tuosi. The Auditorium is
large and good enough for
all but the very best of them,
and local sing-songs and
symphony concerts should
have an occasional look-in
at the people's hall. An
easier rental for indigeneous
musicians would do more to
encourage home talent than
all the patriotic speeches.
And they deserve it. Aus-
tralian orchestra conductors,
like Zelman, Hart and
Heinze, have never marred
their programmes with the
tripe that visiting virtuosi
serve up so plentifully.
“St. John’s Green” (Loud.) : “Barbara’s
Wedding,” the “new” Barrie play, was written
12 years ago; it has been staged at the
Savoy to precede Strindberg’s “The Father.
It is a delicate and whimsical trifle, the cen-
tral figure being an old colonel whose mind
wanders among past episdes. It brings tears
or causes impatience, according to the view-
one takes of a curtain-raiser —it lasts 40
minutes.
“Goldilocks”: The fine male chorus in
“The Student Prince” —easily its greatest
attraction —goes over with the rest of the out-
fit to J.0.W., Ltd. (B. 22/9/’27). The
Empire management scores by getting a
return upon its staging and costuming after
making a profit on them.
“Wood’s Green” (Loud.) : Kingsley Lark
is one of the Australians getting a show on
the programmes of 8.8. G. Lark is a versatile
fellow: linguist, singer, composer, adapter
and impresario. His “Nicolette” was, in the
opinion of many, much better than several
of the American px-oduct.ions which have had
long runs, but he hadn’t sufficient money to
keep it on till its worth was known. It
has been truly said that there is always
someone in London ready to finance a rotten
show, and hardly anyone prepared to put
money up for a first-class play.
“Craiser”: By Christmas Frank Neil will
have a panto, running in Sydney, as well as
another co. playing “The Gorilla,” a mystery
farce. Another show in Melbourne and
another doing the “smalls” will make the
quartet. There will be no melodrama in the
Neil repertoire as long as the rising entre-
preneur remembers that three years ago
blood-’n’-thunder put him on the rocks and
“Charley’s Aunt” floated him off.
“I. Phelps”: John Kirby keeps his front
place on the London music-show stage. In
the new Hippodrome revue “Shake Your
Feet” his impersonation of a sniffisli English
matron is regarded as one of the features of
the piece. Another Australian who is getting
a generous share of camera notice is Madge
Elliott, in the frivolous “Lady Luck” at the
Carlton Theatre.
“C. Ockney”: G. P. Huntley will be
remembered mostly for his aristocratic
noodles, but no character-part in drama was
beyond him. Drifting into musical comedy,
he evolved something fresh in the playing
of dudes, and immediately became the
accepted “silly ass” of the English stage. He
had countless imitators, of course. That is
perhaps the reason why his vaudeville
engagement of a few years back was not the
hit expected.
THE BUSINESS MANAGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
His dress-suit is immaculate.
From top to patent-leathered toes
He stands a living fashion-plate;
His hair with fragrant pomade glows;
He wears a most distingue air—
What wonder that we stand and stare?
Aloof above the common herd
His dignity’s serenely set.
Sometimes he drops a haughty word
To ticket-clerk or usherette.
What else he does nobody knows
Except maintain that striking pose.
They say he sometimes gives a pass,
Or takes one round behind the stage.
His manner then is really “class”
With all a prince’s patronage.
He must be paid a sum immense
To keep up such magnificence.
My son, you envy him his lot;
Yet here a lesson you may learn.
Some day when stage-struck, like as not,
To be a Hamlet you may yearn.
Let not ignoble impulse stir;
Obey instead ambition’s spur
To be a business manager.

What “Dependable”
Really Means
To press the starter button of your car
and know that the engine will respond
almost instantly, even in the coldest
weather—to step on the brakes and find
them immediately effective—to start on
a long journey and know that you will
arrive without annoyance from mechanical
troubles—to know that your car will serve
you for years without costly overhauling,
That is Dependability as the public
applies the word tq Dodge Brothers
product—a Dependability which stands
boldly out among the most important
basic elements underlying Dodge
Brothers remarkable success.

Miss Elsie Prince, a beautiful Itexona
Girl, writes: “I want to be happy and I
want to make you happy, too, so I recom-
mend you to use Rexona Soap for the
shin and hair, same as I do.’ 1
Girls! \
Imagine your
Complexion Clear,
Rosy and Velvety!
Are you sometimes-discouraged and feel
that your skin is unattractive instead of
being' clear, fresh and smooth? If so, look
to the soap you are using.
Many soaps are more injurious to the
skin than actual neglect, for they contain
harmful alkali, which tends to dry up the
skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a speci-
ally prepared skin soap, entirely free from
harmful alkali. It will do more to im-
prove your skin than you ever thought
a soap could do, for it is medicated on
the same principle as the famous
Rexona Ointment. Thus it is able to
exert the hygienic effects of Rexona
upon the skin with every cleansing 1
operation.
Simply use Rexona Spap once or
twice a day, and see if it does noo
relieve the clogged poles, reduce the
tendency to blotches, redness and
oiliness and leave the complexion
clear, rosy and velvety.

‘ IVhat a lovely
Gift! "
The Corridor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AWAKE, responsive to the troubled night,
I hear wind armies battering the
walls;
Their angry cohorts arrogant with might
Thunder and pass to drums and bugle
calls.
Fetch coolness, Fancy, for my staring eyes,
Paint the blank darkness with the loveli-
est hue,
Shepherd my thoughts to wander azure-wise
From beauty on to beauty soft with blue!
Blue —and I see the cloudless arch of noon,
A sea of sapphire, bright cerulean air;
Crisp, crystal-edged, the waves reach up and
croon
Where steel-blue mussel shells are drip-
ping bare.
Azure ; cerulean ; sapphire—words most
sweet
Evoking random memories astray:
The rain-washed blue of a wet city street
When lamps are lit before dusk turns to
grey ;
Far mountains; feathery flitter of blue
wrens;
Young eyes that trust humanity at seven ;
Clumps of proud iris islanding lone fens
Whose waters are blue mirrors holding
heaven.
The blue sheen on black plums and clus-
tered grapes ;
The fiery blue of midnight’s fiercest star ;
The quaintness of old willow-china’s shapes
On a high dresser, plate and bowl and jar.
My mother’s ring, true love’s forget-me-not
Of turquoise set in hand-wrought, filigree ;
Delphiniums lording all the garden plot;
Blue noonday shadows of a blackwood-tree.
Welcoming blue of slow curled woodfire
smoke
From hearts of home when wayworn
feet draw nigh;
Nemophila, love-grove—watch the Little Folk
Drink, in sly pairs, from shallow cups of
sky!
Blue arrow flights where swift in darting
glee
Kingfishers dazzle with a gemmy hue;
Strung, heavy beads of lapis lazuli
On Guinevere’s straight gown of samite
blue.
Pearl blue of lightning; a lost kitten’s eyes
That search for kindness in one’s very
soul;
Blue perfume pots in eastern merchandise;
Blue flames that dance about a burning
coal.
So. first, I summon all the lovely things
Of heaven’s color, then I wait while they
Delicately, on silent azure wings,
Cerulean, sapphire, charm the night to-
day.
Azure, cerulean, sapphire! Sweetest words
Whose beauties build a corridor for me
Floored by a flight of wild blue singing birds
Pillared with sheer empyrean brilliancy,
Wherethrough I walk with tingling feet
upborne
On those warm pulsing pinions of delight;
And smile to hear the echoes, faint, forlorn,
Of the forgotten tumult of black night.
My pleasured steps would pause and yet
make haste:
For one is near me now to charm and
bless—
A queen, a tender nurse, a mistress chaste,
A goddess of most holy gentleness.
Hyacinth robed, and haloed with blue rays ;
Her eyes are bluer than her sapphire
throne;
And when my ravished heart leaps at her
gaze
She stoops and clasps me stilly to her own.
There, in a joy too calm for word or kiss,
Ends the blue corridor in rapture deep.
Under my lady’s smile of tranquil bliss
I close my eyes content; for she is Sleep.
Victoria.
ELSIE COLE.
The Maker of Souls.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE ward bell rang thrice.
Fletcher, the sixth-year man in
charge of the east wing, rose wearily
and relinquished his after-dinner paper.
“It’s that spiritualist johnny, I suppose,
in No. 3 ward,” he commented as he went to
the ’phone. “He’s due to pass out to-
night. His appendix came out twelve hours
too late. That’s the worst of these cases
from the bush.”
He placed the receiver to his ear, while
those of us whose wards were serene thanked
the Powers of Sickness that they had not
challenged us.
“Yes? Doctor Fletcher speaking. ... Pulse
10w?.... Yes, I’m afraid he’s going....
Tables creaking, did you say?. .. . Yes, I
know he’s a spiritualist... . Well, what
about it? His table’s been rapping like that
since four o’clock this afternoon My
dear nurse, don’t be silly. You’re an educated
woman. Things like that shouldn’t scare
y0u.... Ghosts ? Bunkum !. . . . Then tell his
relatives to keep away if they get on your
nerves.... It’s only a religious idea, my
good girl.... Oh. all right, I’ll come round
at once. I didn’t think he’d last much
longer.... Well, if the table raps any more
take it away.”
He hung up and grinned at us. “She’s
scared stiff, that little probationer,” he said.
“It is that spiritualist. They say lie’s a
medium, and the furniture’s been moving.”
Hanson the neurologist looked up. “It's
tough on those girls, alone in the wards at
night.”
Fletcher passed his hand over his hair.
“Tell you the truth, I don’t fancy it myself.
I swear I saw that chap’s ward-cupboard
move a good two inches this afternoon.” He
sighed and regarded us apologetically. “It
takes some explaining, you know. Especially
as he's just about to die.”
He left the room.
For a minute nobody spoke. The great
hospital all around us was very quiet. The
night nurses had taken over, and a few soft-
shod orderlies went their rounds, lamps in
hands; even the casualty ward had not. begun
its nightly racket. For us- in the Residents
lounge there remained only an hour or two,
reading and talking, before we sought our
beds.
“It is queer,” said somebody.
“What —that table rapping?” Hanson
lowered his book. “Of course, it is. I don t
envy that little nurse to-night. There are
so many queer things to be explained in
life.”
“Rocknar” said a surgeon in a corner.
At that one or two of us looked up. Han-
son put his book on his knee.
“Yes, Rocknar would have been interested,”
he remarked thoughtfully.
“ ’Member that time he tried to photograph
the moment of death, with that amputation
case in the Alexandra ward?” asked the
surgeon.
“He did photograph something,” said Han-
son.
Those of us within hearing sat up. “What
was it like?” I asked.
“Clouds. Grey smoke —coming out of the
man’s head,” replied Hanson. “Nothing defi-
nite in shape. . . . He was a queer cuss, that
same Rocknar. Bit of a genius, I think.”
“Ended in an asylum, gibbering,” remarked
a pathologist.
“And young Finlater married his widow
indecently soon,” finished the surgeon.
“Nevertheless,” said Hanson slowly, “he
had hold of something pretty big. I helped
him with a few of his experiments. They
used to scare me.”
AVe were interested by now. “Go on”
came from someone.
Hanson filled his pipe. “It’s seven years
now since Finlater and the woman were
killed in that train-smash.” he said; “so I
don’t suppose it matters if I tell what did
happen. Finlater, as a matter of fact”—he
watched us curiously, because he knew he
was about to startle us—“was in love with
Rocknar’s wife long before Rocknar died.
And she was in love with him. And Rocknar
knew all about it. And that’s why Rocknar
went to a mental hospital and died there.”
Wo all exclaimed in surprise and forgot
our literature.
“You remember Rocknar’s ‘psychon’
theory?” Hanson went on, after we had
settled again. “He was, if anything, a
dualist, philosophically. He held that there
was a separate, immaterial, weightless entity
that survived death and could act indepen-
dently of the body. He thought it a species
of othoric being created by nervous activity,
as a field of force is created by an electric
currrent running through a wire. It was
composed, he believed, of ‘psychons’ as units,
just as cells are the units of the bodily
tissue, and that they arranged themselves
in psychoarams, forming a mnema. What we
call a memory or personality.”
He drew hard on his pipe. “Of course,
the great difficulty was to prove by material
means the existence of this body; make it
do things, or see it, or something. He de-
voted himself to this problem, and actually
did arrive at some sort of a proof. He de-
vised an instrument which enabled this,
psychic body to be seen—or at least photo-
graphed. That was where I came in. He
invited me to help, with my neurological
stuff. And I used to go out to his place
pretty often.
“So did Finlater. I hadn’t been there a
week before it dawned on me what was hap-
pening to the emotions of young Finlater and
Airs. Rocknar, and I marvelled that Rocknar
didn’t see it, too. He and I used to go out
to his laboratory to work in the evenings,
and Finlater sat in the house with the lady
—who was young, too young for Rocknar —-
until we came back. None of my business.
I said nothing, of course. I wasn’t particu-
larly fond of Rocknar beyond the sort of
fondness that is half-respect for a man’s
intellect. Anyhow, any man less absorbed
in his work would have spotted what was
going on.
“The situation must have been developing
all the while we were working. It was
during the war, and Rocknar, who at times
branched out into mad ideas of making money
to go on with his work, was investigating
something which might have turned the
whole war game into a business infinitely
more diabolical than anyone has ever imag-
ined.”
Hanson drew three puffs from his pipe.
“Imagine a machine —a ray projector—which
would transform normal men into brainless
imbeciles in the fraction of a second. That
was what Rocknar was after. It looked like
a motor head-lamp, the finished model that
only once did I see in action. In fact, the
parabolic reflector was actually part of a
large head-lamp, from Rocknar’s own car.
It directed a beam of the rays at the brain
—vibrations a good deal higher in frequency
than even the Gamma rays of radium. Rock
nar said these vibrations depolarised the
psychon. As psyebograms, the units of the
mnema or personality of an individual, were
made up of polarised psychons, this ray
simply dissolved into chaos all the intricate
structures that had been built up during the
lifetime of the individual—-destroyed his
memory, his acquired reflexes and co-ordi-
nations, all his psychic entity, and reduced
him to the mental condition of a newlv-born
babe.
“He’d certainly demented a few rats and
about fifty guinea-pigs. The thing was un-
canny and diabolical. I saw him. even in
his early discoveries, simply turn the thing
on to them as they moved in a normal man-
ner about their cages; there would be a slight
humming from the motor and a hissing from
the discharge brushes of the plate machine
it drove to create a field of high tension —
and the wretched brutes dropped over on
their sides, absolutely mindless! It took
months to re-educate them —as long, in fact,
as it had previously taken for their psychic
bodies to be built up by life experience!
“He’d tried it on dogs, with the same
effect. The biggest animal he’d been able
to get was a bull. But. a bull’s mentality
was low, he said, and he wasn't sure how it

Whether you are a student
of the Classics or a lover of
Jazz, you will enjoy every
movement of this delightful
suite. The music possesses a
charm and piquancy that is
wholly irresistible, and once
you have heard these fine
Records you will play them
again anil again.
The Recording is a master-
piece of realism, and the Phil-
adelphia Symphony Orchestra
—one of the finest in the world
-—has given an interpretation
of Tschaikovsky’s work that
can only be described as
brilliant.
would act with the powerful and well-estab-
lished mentality of a human being. He was,
I used to feel uncomfortably sure, longing to
try it on some human.
“All this while Finlater and the woman
must have been discovering they were made
for each other. We would come back to the
house sometimes at midnight, and find them
still apparently talking harmlessly and
brightly, ready to give us coffee before Fin-
later and I left for home. Finlater said he
was interested in art, and made that a pretext
for staying so late. Used even to take her
to shows and concerts—at least, that’s where
they said they went. Towards the end they
became so reckless in their belief in Rock-
nar’s blindness that I wished desperately
Rocknar’s experiments would end and leave
me free to drop out of the business before
the explosion came.
“It came all of a sudden, as these things
will. We’d stopped at the garage near Rock-
nar’s house, Rocknar and I, which I suppose
made them think our footsteps on the gravel
had been a false alarm; and, as we moved
again, We could see them through the light
curtains, kissing under the shaded lights of
the room.
“Rocknar stopped dead, and I stopped with
him. There was an abominable pause, and
when I looked at Rocknar’s face it was
stony. Then he spoke.
“ ‘Did you see that?’ he asked me.
“ ‘I did,’ I said.
“I heard him give a sort of hissing snarl.
“ ‘Fool!’ he snapped viciously. ‘Can’t keep
his hands off her. She’s mine.’
“He started up the drive again. I began
to make some remark about leaving him, but
he took my arm.
“ ‘Oh, don’t worry about them,’ he said
to me, calmly enough. ‘What do they mat-
ter? There are bigger things on hand than
lovesick animals like that.’
“He made me come up to the house, though
I almost insisted on going home.
“He behaved in the house exactly as if he
had seen nothing at all. They met us with
their usual chatter, and we had coffee in the
most amiable way. I noticed Rocknar look-
ing with narrowed eyes at his rival several
times, but mostly he seemed thoughtful.
“And nothing happened about it. I re-
ceived a ring the next day from Rocknar ask-
ing me to come up as usual in the evening,
and when I tried to gather what had hap-
pened he treated the thing so lightly that
I thought lie must really be one of those
extraordinary men who can subdue their
emotional life for the benefit of their work.
Finlater was there at the house as usual,
suggesting that he and Mrs. Rocknar go to
a concert given by a visiting violinist; Rock-
nar permitted it with his usual appearance of
absent-mindedness.
“Down in the lab. he was a little more
silent than usual, and demented a cageful
of mice with his infernal machine.
“And then he had a call into the country
for a few days.
“I’d left some books at his place that I
wanted rather badly, and I rang Mrs. Rock-
nar to say I would be round for them in
the evening. I was detained, and it was
nine o’clock before I got to the house.
“Rocknar opened the door to me.
“I stared at him for a moment. The house
had seemed very silent and lightless as I
had walked up the drive, and I had cer-
tainly not expected him to be home, and
certainly not to answer the door himself.
“ ‘Hullo! I thought you were away,’ I
said, curiously inclined to stammer as 1
looked at him. ‘I came to get those books
of mine.’
“His brows went up. ‘Books?’ he said
suavely. ‘You came round to get some books?’
“And I felt that he did not believe me. I
read impossible things in his tones.
“ ‘Yes. That book of Rhimer’s, “Physical
Basis of Psychic Autonomy,’ you know, and
Libou on “Dissociation.” Left ’em here last
night.’
“His manner changed pleasantly. ‘Of
course. Come in. I’ll get them for you,’ he
said.
“‘You’re back soon?’ I suggested as I
followed him into the hall.
“ ‘Yes. Thought I’d like to try an experi-
ment.’ he said, without turning his head.
“He’d said it casually enough. But I
felt a curious thrill of excitement run
through me. That kiss we had seen leapt
into my mind.
“He went striding across the hall and
over to the foot of the stairs. Then he
turned and faced me.
“ ‘Come on up,’ he invited. ‘l’m perform-
ing it upstairs, for various reasons. You
might be interested.’
“I followed him with my misgivings wide
awake. He went straight up to the land-
ing, and over to a door, which he swung
open.
“ ‘Go in,’ he said.
“I took one step within the room and
halted. It was his wife’s bedroom. Her
bed faced the door, and she was asleep in
it. And at the foot of the bed stood a
tripod surmounted by the projector of his
machine.
“I started to back out. ‘What’s this for?’
I began.
“But he pushed me in suddenly and shut
the door.
“ ‘lt’s all right. I’ll explain,’ he said,
walking to the bed.
“I stared at him suspiciously, wild ideas
circulating in my mind. I looked anxiously
at his wife, still apparently sound asleep.
“ ‘About her?’ I asked, speaking in a
whisper.
“ ‘No need to speak like that,’ he said,
looking at her. ‘She won’t wake, however
much noise we make. I’ve seen to that.’
“My eyes went to the machine at the
foot of the bed. He was adjusting some-
thing. Near the feet of it lay a baseboard
to which were fastened the complete outfit,
motor, plate-machine, Leyden jars and so on
for the field of high tension, and they were
apparently worked by the house current,
which was led to them by flexible cord.
“ ‘What are you going to do?’ I demanded.
“He did not answer. I took a step back
to the door and put my hand on the handle
of it. At the sound he turned sharply round,
saw my action, and his hands flew to the
machine at the top of the tripod. I saw a
spark flash in the plate-machine as the
motor started, and there arose that devilish i
humming sound from the parabolic reflector.
I stiffened and grew chill with fear.
“ “Don’t move or I’ll turn it on you, he
gritted at me, his face diabolical behind the
machine.
“I froze. There was nothing else to do.
I had seen animals demented in a second by
the thing. I had seen an ox go down as
if beheaded, mindless and mentally disem-
bowelled. I could see the ghostly flicker ot
the beam shooting past my head and focus-
sing a little to the side of me. A turn ot
his wrist and
“ ‘lt’s not you I want,’ he said. You re
a scientist and harmless. But you mustn’t
spoil my experiment. Stop quite still.’
"I stopped still for half a minute, my
nerves fluttering like rags. At length I
took a look round the room. There seemed
nothing in it to help me. His wife had
obviously been drugged, and I could see the
rise and fall of her breathing from where I
stood. Her dressing-table stood beside the
door, quite near me —one of those tliree-
mirrored things, with electric-candles
attached. And at the window beside it was
another table. Not even a chair was within
reach. By this time I saw that he was not
responsible for himself.
“ ‘I don’t know when the experiment will
begin,’ he said to me, switching off the
power so that the humming died down. “It
might be any time now. I’ll have to trouble
you to wait for a bit.’
“‘What are you going to do?’ I managed
to ask him.
“He shrugged. ‘Wait and see.’
“I suppose we stood there, silent and still,
I at the door and he with his hands fumbling
about his machine, for five minutes that
seemed five thousand years. And then —I
heard a faint sound in the hall below.
“And so did he. It had been, so it seemed
to me, the click of a key in a Yale lock—
a front-door lock.
“He stiffened and grinned at me. ‘You
heard that?’ he asked. ‘I don’t think we
have long to wait now.’
“We waited. Presently I heard the sound
of footsteps coming up the stairs, and a
voice called softly for Mrs. Rocknar, by her
Christian name. And the voice was the voice
of Finlater.
“His steps came cautiously up the stairs.
He coughed gently once, and paused outside
the door.
“There was a click before me and I knew
that the machine had been set in action.
When I looked I saw Rocknar’s eyes fixed
on myself, daring me fiendishly to make
any move. That appalling humming
seemed to fill the whole room, and my only
hope was that Finlater would hear it.
“Rut he didn’t. I heard the door-handle
creak behind me, and the door slowly open.
“Rocknar swung the beam directly above
my head and over to the edge of the door.
“He looked down for an instant to his
feet; it seemed that he was standing on part
of the flex-cord, and he kicked it quietly
away from him, shifting the beam as he did
so.
“And then, at one and the same moment,
I heard a gasp from Finlater behind me, and
saw the whole of Rocknar’s expression alter.
“I cannot describe the change that came
over it. One moment he had been standing
there with a look of Satanic hatred and
fierce, deliberate joy intermingled on his
features. The next instant his jaw dropped,
his eyes widened and every spark of meaning
went out of his expression.
“He swayed back from his instrument,
making no attempt to save himself, and then
slumped down beside it. The tripod was
thrown headlong. Finlater came into the
room and stood by the door, gaping at him
and then at me.
“The woman in the bed did not stir.
Neither did we two men. The silence was
positively crawling over us.
“ ‘What is it?’ Finlater asked, in a
whisper.
“I began to move towards the man on the
floor, when something which was Rocknar’s
voice yet not his voice reached us both and
halted us.
“He was making an extraordinary sound
between a gurgle and a howl. He was mov-
ing convulsively on the floor, waving his
arms and legs, and screwing up his face as
if trying to cry.
“We both went towards him, and knelt
beside him. He stared up at us without a
sign of recognition, and his facial muscles
went through the motions of a baby unde-
cided whether to cry or laugh. In his eyes
there was the frightful blankness and lack
of humanity that is to be found only in the
cretinoid imbeciles who have been brainless
from birth.”
Hanson stopped speaking.
The silence in the lounge was broken at
last by the voice of the surgeon.
“What happened?” lie asked.
We all relaxed at the sound of his voice.
Hanson relighted his dead pipe, and two or
three voices raised themselves at once as
lie did so.
“Finlater and I worked it all out after-
wards,” said Hanson. “For about a quarter
of an hour, we had, as you can imagine, a
pretty hectic time. Mrs. Rocknar did not
wake. She’d been put to sleep with some'
thing, and as far as we could figure Rocknar
intended her to wake the following day—to
find Finlater in the room with her, mind-
less. . . . Yes. Pretty ghastly.... What had
happened? Well, you know that dressing-
table with three mirrors? That, as I told
you, was just beside the door. We worked
it out before we left: these fays were re-
flected by ordinary mirrors, yon see—not
very'Well, because of their short length, but
sufficiently well to have saved Finlater—-and
the beam must have impinged on the mirror
nearest the door when Rocknar shifted the
cable with Iris foot. We found discolored
patches in the silvering exactly as if that
was what had happened.... How did we get
out of it? Well, we just got out by the
front door. Finlater confessed everything
while we were walking home. And I sup-
pose the machine is still amongst Roeknar's
apparatus, waiting for his relations to claim
it. They can have it with pleasure as far
as I’m concerned.”
