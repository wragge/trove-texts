and Scottish Universities, and comoleted his
studies in the leading hospitals of Europe. He
has made a life-long study of
Private, Nervous
AND
SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period
of many years, obtained the highest position in
his profession. The various diseases embraced in
his speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

more matured age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely Frequent headaches ;
giddiness ; drowsiness in the day time; irregu-
larity of the bowels; feeling of fullness after eat-
ing; specks floating before the eyes; halos or circles
round a candle ; cold hands and feet; pains in the
back, or under the shoulder-blade; tenderness
of the breast-bone on pressure; yellowish dis-
charge from the mouth on to the pillow during
sleep; palpitation of the heart; unpleasant
dreams; clammy hands; an aversion to
society ; a whitish or cloudy sediment in
the urine, after standing; fear of some-
thing dreadful about to happen ; impure blood ;
spots or pimples on the back, chest, legs,

common in these Colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
that has lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send

DEBILIT Y,
and should be enclosed in the first letter.

A Complete Diet in Itself.
Requiring simply the addition of water to make
it instantly ready for use.
Renders valuable assistance in Wasting Fever.
Beneficial as a Diet in severe cases of Typhoid.
Invaluable in Cholera Infantum.
Processor Sidney Ringer, of the University College,
London, says Nestle's Food is the lest of all foods
for delicate children.
Extracts from Prof. Ziemssen’s “ Cyclopaedia of
the Practice of Medicine
ON CHOLERA INFANTUM.—VoI. VII.
“ Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the
principal method of treatment for Sporadic
Cholera, and particularly Cholera Infantum.
When the mother’s milk is insufficient, Nestle’s
Food is alone to be recommended. ” —Prof. Wm. O.
IjKUbe
On TREATMENT of RACHITIS—VoI. XVI.
“ In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding
stands foremost among the causes of those gastro-
intestinal disorders which are so dangerous in
infant life. I recommend Nestle’s Infant Food
from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.” —Prof. Senator.
On SCROFULOSIS.—VoI. XVI.
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.”—Prof.
Birch-Hirschfeld.

It is a-lighler, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy

This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed

It is very palatable when taken internally, which places

[FOR THE BULLETIN]
“ Many poor prospectors who have' struck good sftews
have had to sell them to investors for a mere song in order
to obtain tucker.”— Coolgardie Teler/nam.
So you’re goin’ to Westralia on a hungry track
and dry,
Where all the gold that’s easy gettin’ you see
meltin’ in the sky ;
An’ once you strike the reef, my you think
your trouble’s done,
An’ that, for many a long ,day afterv you’ll sit
shaded from the sun
With the claret-jug rim-level, an’ the- waiter at
your call,
An’ the run of Scott’s or Betty’s, an’ a We of loaf
an’ all;
But betwixt you an’ the claret an’ the other
splendid lot
Is the empty tucker-bag which \yill assist t® take
your pot—
To buy out your blessed claim
Just before it gets its fame.
If your shaft’s a foot off bottom they will scent, it
all the same—
When you’re hard-up for your tucker,’
An’you think the reef’s a mucker,
The syndicate arises, an’ your claim floats on their
name.
For be you Edward Stringer who discovered
Stringer’s Creek,
Or be you brace or platman at your fifty bob a
week,
You’ll find the syndicate that sleeps while yon the
tampers lift
Is bound to get a Chesterfield while you have but
your shift,
For prospectors aye knock under just before they
blast the face,
An’ the syndicate of brokers cfeim the work and
own the place ;
An’ in mostly all such cases wanfr of tucker makes
you walk ,
Out for distant fields and brighter*, an’ they get
the claim for talk, t
An’ they buy your “ duffer claim,”
Ah’ an hour’s work gives it fame ;
An’ your only consolation is—it bears yc mo Jonah
name—
When you think you have no luck, or
You’re uncommon short of tucker,
You will sell it for a song, an’ they’ll win an easy
game.
What! Charley Rasp—Oh, yes, he made a
million with the Hill,
An’ he pegged the Hill, an’ held it, an’ he’s got a
big slice still;
But the Barrier isn’t mining—it is just a chemist’s
shop
With a gang o’ labourers diggin’ graves, an’
blastin’ down the ’crop ;
An’ a metal ain’t a metal which wants boilin’
down like lard,
An’ of no account is silver, an’ the market’s awful
hard.
You're a-chasin’ golden reefin’, an’ you’ll find
Coolgardie’s lot
’S to be owned by kid-gloved owners who’ll buy
in an’ take the p t
Take your golden quartz-bound claim,
Which to you’s not worth the game.
You may find an’ find till Kingdom Come—the
ends are all the same—
Golden reefs ain’t toothsome tucker.
Without coin you’ll come a mucker,
An’ you’ll be consoled by seein’ it their reef an’—
well, your name.
No! Your grit may guide you gold-ward, ai.’
your brains may find it then,
But if it ain’t alluvial—it’s for “a better class o’
men.”
An’you’ll foot it to the rush, an’ they'll come by
fust-class trains,
An’they’ll win despite your long start, for their
bullion is their brains.
You’ll go on and sink- for ever till you’re sick of
all such graft,
An’ then the agent buys it with a little cash and
craft.
An’ yon track the blasted reefing, hill and gorge,
and dig again,
An’the want of tucker sells you to the “better
class o’ men”—
Men who’ll take your duffer claim,
An’ in a foot more win the game ;
While you shaft another reef just deep enough to
sell the same.
An’ you’ll sell it for some tucker
To the men whose graft is lucre—
To the syndicate which takes your work and calls
it by their name.

Brisbane daily, 21st Oct. :—“ We are
not in the habit of excluding letters because we
dissent from their contents.” The Bulletin is a
bit of a liar itself.
“For reasons which, gentlemen, you and
I have not time to study here, as deplorable as
they are surprising, the oratory of the gentleman
completely suspends all action of his mind. The
moment he begins to talk, his mental operations
cease. I never knew of but one thing which
compared with my friend in this particular. That
was a small steam-boat. Back in the days when
I performed my part as a keel boatman, I made
the acquaintance of a trifling little steamboat
which used to bustle and puff and wheeze about
in the Sangamon River. It had a five-foot boiler
and a seven-foot whistle, and every time it
whistled it stopped.”— Abraham Lincoln.

Harry Power’s Capture.—“ The Accursed
Gin.”
Editor Bulletin, — From time to time I have
read much in The Bulletin relating to Harry
Power, the old Vic. bushranger, and I remember
seeing something controversial as to his capture.
I have since disinterred some notes I made when
he was liberated from Pentridge in Feb., ’B5. I
met Power by appointment with the police imme-
diately he was driven to the detective-office prior
to his final release, and, with a view to writing his
life, I maintained him for some weeks at a
local temperance hotel. He was pleased
with the idea, and gave me dictation for
hours daily, narrating in a sensationally
descriptive manner the principal exploits
in _ his career as well as many incidents
which he drew from imagination. Everything
went swimmingly until his sister appeared; at
her expressed wish he, for her children’s sake,
properly refused to go one step further. I don’t
propose to weary you with a long yarn, as Power
has almost faded from the public memory, but I
think his own description of his capture should be
given in order to clear up any doubts that may
exist. Here are his own words :
My mia mia was on a high ridge at Mount Bulla, and
was only approachable from one point, the ravines on
each side being almost perpendicular and extremely
dangerous to anyone but a clever bushman. From the
mia mia I had a pretty clear view of the surrounding
country, and nobody could possibly surprise me. 1 never
had the slightest fear of being taken there and
I never would have been captured at home but for the
treachery of the villains I befriended. I gave them lots
of money and, unfortunately, put too much confidence in
them, They knew my hut well and often visited me—in
fact, without their assistance I don’t know how I should
have managed at all. You see, it was necessary for me to
get “ telegraphic” information of the movements of the
police and any strangers who might be about, and this 1
arranged with the ’s in a very simple way. We
selected a small tree two miles from the mia mia and fas-
tened a string of green hide to it; by a system of knots
we were able to understand each other as far as necessary.
For instance, if the police or strangers were about,
G or one of the boys, w'ould leave home at once
and make a certain number of knots in the piece of hide.
Of course I \ isited the “ Telegraph Station ” every day,
and when the danger-signal was hoisted I remained
hidden. When the coast w'as clear I would ride to 's
house, which was some distance away, and get whatever
1 wanted in the shape of horse-feed or articles of food.
Early in the morning of the day 1 was captured the signal
gave “ line clear,” and I rode to ’s for horse-feed.
I remained there pretty w'ell the whole day, and, contrary
to my custom, I had a few nobblers of gin. Mrs.
seemed uneasy all day, and I could not make it out. At
first she said she had a notion that something was going
to happen, and afterwards she insinuated—she did not
say so outright—that the boys (meaning her sons) were
accepting money from the police to put me away. She
said the boys had a lot of money, and she could not
understand how or where they got it. I paid very little
attention to what she said, and after tea I got the girl to
give me a bag of chaff, which I put in front of me on the
horse and started for home. Feeling tired and suffering
from an old injury I met with through riding, 1 had
several nips from a bottle of gin, and I know it got into
my head. When 1 was going up the ridge to the mia
mia my old mare appeared frightened at something and
hesitated, but thinking it was only a kangaroo or a
wallaby I took no notice and moved her along. After
putting her in the stable I went into the mia mia, lit a
Are, and made g.n-toddy, and soon afterwards fell asleep
with a shawl about my head. Just at day-break I was
suddenly aroused by a heavy weight falling’on me on the
stretcher. I could not see with the shawl around my
head, but I knew instantly that someone had hold of
me, and using all my strength I threw the man over
the stretcher and against the side of the tent. I was
feeling for one of my revolvers when both my hands were
firmly gripped and held behind my head. The shawl was
pulled off and there I beheld in astonishment Hare, still
jammed between the stretcher and the tent, while Nichol-
s )>i and Montford were handcuffing me. The blackfellow
Donald stood by. I gave up resistance—l knew I was
their prisoner. I was afterwards told that Hare was very
eager to shoot me when I was going up to the mia mia,
but Nicholson would not let him, preferring, as he said,
to take Power alive. Hare said; “ Power’s dead body is
as good to us as if we take him alive,” but Nicholson per-
sistently refused to let him shoot, feeling satisfied that
they could easi y effect my capture at daybreak. Had I
not covered my head with the shawd I am certain I could
have got my revolver and made something like a decent
resistance. As it was, I had no chance at all, and I blame
the cursed gin for being taken so easily.
Power informed me that he never took a life in
cold blood. The only act he regretted was the
shooting off of a woman’s ear. He said : “She
knew I would not kill her, and she persisted in
clinging to me and crying for help, and 1 was
obliged to shoot off one of her ears to get away
from her.”
KARL.
About the longest word in the English
language is Undenominationalization.
“Hon. Mackenzie Bo well pronounces his
name ‘Bull.’” Which recalls Mark Twain’s
Hon. Patrique Oreille.
Two “ mad-doctors ” —antitypes in tem-
perament and character and rival stars in bril
lianey—died recently in France about the same
hour—Blanche, the tender Samaritan; Charcot,
the insensitive scientist. Blanche inherited from
Ids father an apostleship of humanity; Charcot
dived into scientific secrets through experiments
made regardless of human suffering. It was
Blanche, the elder, who first attempted to treat
lunatics with kindness, and his son improved on
his departure from the old terrorism. Blanche
cared little for theory; Charcot would prove or
disprove every new theory by actual experiment
on human subjects. Blanche aimed solely at
curing; Charcot wanted rather to “find out.”
Long before M. Naquet was ever heard of, Blanche
advocated that lunacy should be a sufficient
ground of divorce, and has been known at a law-
court to defend eloquently a wife’s adultery, on
the ground that it had been committed in the
interest of posterity, her husband being the son of
first cousins who died demented. Blanche held
that ill-shaped ears and ill-shaped teeth express
the kind of degeneration that makes for lunacy.
Charcot discovered that gout and rheumatism
were one and the same disease, and defined the
natural laws which produce phenomena that, in the
middle ages, were ascribed to witchcraft and
diabolism. Both men were enthusiastically
enamoured of the fine arts.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1893.
The Multiplicity of Candidates.
JEveey day adds fresh confusion to the
prospects of next New South Wales Parlia-
mentary election. Though the contest is
yet several months, distant nearly every
small, parochial celebrity in the province has
already announced himself as a candidate,
and new competitors are heard of almost
daily. The single-electorate system and the
want of a second ballot give every
adventurer his chance amid the general
bewilderment. The want of an efficient
Local Government system creates a con-
stantly-increasing demand for the purely
local variety of politician and a steadily 1 "
decreasing demand for any other variety, for
it has been discovered that the broad-
minded man of statesmanlike leanings, ih
his care for matters of national con-
cern, doesn’t scramble desperately enough
for loan-moneys, and, consequently, his own
constituency is neglected. And the want of
a Referendum, whereby old and long-vexed
questions can be settled outside the Legisla-
ture, makes it necessary for every separate
fad and vested interest, and every particular
assortment of cranks, and every syndicate
and public and semi-public swindle, and
every creed and sect to struggle desperately
for separate representation in the Legislative
Assembly.
# # •
Too much centralisation is one great cause
of the political troubles of Australia—and
especially of N.S. Wales, where centrali-
sation assumes a more aggravated form than
in any other Province. Tlie Legislature
at Sydney is the one source from which all
blessings flow. Therefore, once every three
years or so, Protectionists and Foreign-
traders, Local Optionists, licensed victuallers,
Single-taxers, Land-taxers, National Ass.
candidates, Labour candidates, Female-
Suffragists, Federation ists, Provincialists,
and all the people who want railways, roads,
bridges, culverts, cable subsidies, fixity of
pastoral tenure, the Bible-in-schools —in fact
everybody, and all the people who want any-
thing—indulge in a frantic rush and skurry
for the chance of being uppermost in the
next Parliament. There is only one Pool of
Siloam, and at irregular intervals the Governor
descends and troubles the waters, and there-
after the political party that gets in first is
healed of its disease —which is generally a
craving after ten portfolios with a salary
attached to each.
* # #
The abolition of the £4O deposit formerly
exacted from each candidate has encouraged
many obscure parties and individuals, who
never before had sufficient faith in them-
selves to bet upon their prospects of
success, to take a chance on this
occasion, in the public lottery. The single-
electorate system and the absence of
any provision for a second ballot have
encouraged many more, for in a small elec-
torate where, perhaps, only half the electors
go to the poll, and their votes are divided
among anything under a dozen candidates,
it is quite possible for even a prominent
footballer to get in on the votes of his per-
sonal admirers simply because he is a promi-
nent footballer, so that even the humblest
celebrity has a show. And beyond and above
all these things, the political situation is
befogged by the fact that the native Corn-
stalk is a superficial and unstable being,
whose political gods are such individuals as
Parkes and Crick, and Samson Haynes,
and Jawbone Neild anji M‘Elhone— to say
nothing of many typical political rowdies
who, being either dead, or in gaol, or
vanished out of politics, need not be here
specified. His affections are centred on the
politician with the longest hair and the most
brassy yell—the one who uses the strongest
language, and owns the largest collection of
unprintable stories, and who makes the
greatest number of disturbances in the
lobby. Among all these varied circum-
stances, the probabilities are that the next
New South Wales Parliament will consist
very largely of new men, representing a
perfect chaos of politics and detached in-
terests, and that its aggregate portrait will
look like a comprehensive view of a butchers’
annual picnic,
» • •
The position of affairs in all the urban con-
stituencies is very much the same—the case
of Waverley (Sydney) will make as good an
example as any other. In that district nine
candidates are already reported as being in
the field, and how many more may transpire
before the day of nomination is an unknown
circumstance. The list includes Alfred
Allen, a feeble poet of the Cold Tea per-
suasion ; his brother, the other Allen,
known as “ Soapy King, National Ass
representative ; Gannon, a lawyer, who says
he is favourable to the Labour interest ;
Waterhouse, a straight - out Freetrader
and otherwise undefined ; Dr. Edwards,
more or less in the same interest, but
not very well defined ; T, Read, lawyer ; J.
Carroll ; and M. Cannon, milk-dealer.
Of the nine, four are aldermen and two are
ex-aldermen. Two represent Protection,
though not with any special violence, and four
are understood to have Foreign - trade
leanings, though three of them are not very
strongly defined either. One is aggressively
teetotal. Two are opposed to payment of
members—one of the pair being more
strongly opposed than the other ; two repre-
sent religion among other things ; one repre-
sents principally drink ; and otherwise they
are nine respectable and peacefully mediocre
men of no special account. But in one
respect they are almost unanimous ; they
are hideously and incurably local in
soul as well as in body, and the trail
of the alderman is over them all.
Among the nine the milkman has probably
as good a chance as any—not because of his
originality, or his mental depth, or because
he has any great ideas, or even any un-
usually large number of small ones, but
because, in his own little circle, he is an
honourable milkman and a pleasant acquaint-
ance, and his cow-fluid is an article that can
be relied upon. All over New South Wales
the next election is going to be a great occa-
sion for the milkman, and the baker, and
the butcher, and the small attorney, and
their little species in general.
• # *
This state of things, as already pointed
out, is largely owing to the want of an effi-
cient Local Government system, for so long
as the Legislature at Sydney is the source
from which all public works, down to the
plank-bridge over the farthest west creek,
are derived, so long will the parochial politi-
cian be sent there to look after them. It is
partly owing to the want of a Second Ballot,
whereby even the very smallest bush nota-
bility may get in by accident ; and partly to
many other circumstances. Also, it is
owing, in some measure, to the fact that
the Australian native has a strange and
weird taste in Parliamentary representa-
tives, and regards politics to a great
degree as a kind of football “ scrum,” and,
before the present awful depression damped
his enthusiasm, would gladly have returned
William Beach or Peter Jackson to Par-
liament—in the days of their first supre-
macy, that is ; and would have cheerfully
nominated the winner of the Botany Handi-
cap ; and would even have given his vote
to Carbine if that animal had been eligible
for a seat in the Assembly. Consequently,
the House is much pervaded by comic legis-
lators who insist ou knocking each other out
in one round in the lobby, and who fill the
business paper day after day with inane
questions and motions about nothing that is
of any use or interest ; and there is an
inferior nigger-minstrel element in New
South Wales politics which makes it difficult,
half the time, to decide whether the country
is in jest or earnest. This latter trouble is
one which no constitutional reform can
remedy. Even the most perfect system of
Government can’t prevent the persistent
return of the generation of festive legislators
if the electors desire their presence in the
House. And, for some inscrutable reason,
it would appear that the electors generally
do desire their presence.
A Voice from the Gallows.
The Australian press generally has misinter-
preted the moral Reducible from the hanging of
Blantern in Brisbane (Q.). Blantern, besides
being unfortunate (or vicious) in other forms,
was a wine-bibber. He was of highly impres-
sionable temperament, and so, when safely in
chains and awaiting the greased rope, with the
parson at his elbow and the silhouetted devil in
the distance, he grabbed hold of the parson,
swore off the sins he could never commit again,
accused himself of being a victim to the Curse
of Alcohol, and bequeathed a Sermon to Young
Men. Which homily the press seized, and,
Alcohol having no friends worth speaking
about, the press —whose members individually
and secretly worship frequently at the Curse’s
shrine jumped on the traditional monster.
Blantern, in short, mis-diagnosed his own
case, and the press trumpeted his error with
emphatic endorsement. Coolly analysing the
authentic facts relating to the man who died
condemned by law and saved by a parson, they
teach differently. Blantern not only looked
upon Rum but also upon Woman. Blantern
mixed his luxuries. It is emphatically not a
world-recognised experience that Drink—
despite the misguided asseverations of pro-
hibitionists—impels a man to chop up his
sweetheart, or even his fellow-man. There
must be deep-seated causality added to the
liquor. Drink may effect, and generally does
effect, a loosening of the checks restraining
a man’s otherwise governable inclinations, but
Drink does not breed those inclinations. Drink
merely causes the surrender of reason and
caution. In extreme cases, it completes
irresponsibility by obliterating sanity. That is
all bad enough, without piling on Drink the
added crimes whose seedlings were in the
sober man.
# # *
Drink simply removes safeguards. Thus the
generous man, when drunk, becomes a weeping
Juggins, the prey of cold-blooded, teetotal
sharpers. The bloody-minded, ferocious animal,
when drunk, is easily stirred to tigerishuess.
There are men whose ichor is so frigid that
drink only makes them more machine-like in
their calculated actions. Drink, in short, is an
auxiliary outside of the man. The other
passion—Love—to which Blantern, as are
many men who never come to the gallows, was
prone, is part of the individual entity, the Ego
itself. World-experience proves that True Love
—red-hot, boiling-over (insane, if you like)
sexual magnetism—acts in exaetty the same
way always and everywhere, whether in the
gamecock or bullpup, the Royal Bengal tiger,
or that bundle of contradictions, Man. No
fiercely-loving male of any species can brook
the appropriation of his female by another,
whether that female is a consenting or a dis-
senting party to the appropriation. The history
of mankind is blood-re.d with examples. As a
corollary, no fiercely-loving man can acquiesce
in the rejection of his suit by a woman who has
become a rankling necessity to his existence.
As a further deduction, if a man does receive
with indifference, or with suppressed instincts,
his connubial conge from the maiden of his
fancy, the measure of his real love is nothing
like full. She is not his twin —his "affinity—
the co.mplemeut of his being. •
» * *
There seems to be no alternative—“ Marry
me, or you shall not marry another.” It sighs
through all creation. It is limned in the
fiercest of contrasts. The result of True Love
is either the Altar or the Halter (or suicide for
the pusillanimous). “ Marry me, or I’ll gash
gaps in your existence.” Blantern didn’t die
of too much Drink, but of too much True Love-
love that was volcanic, Al-at-LLOYD’s, 212 deg.
Fahrenheit, steam-escaping, my-whole-life-on-
the-safety-valve Love ! Whoop ! Blantern
leaves no Sermon on Devil Alcohol; his is a
Thesis on Emasculation ! Drink was not his
destroyer, but Cupid ! Were any emotional
publicist, carried away with the terrors of his
theme, to assume the Seer’s office and shout
frenziedly to the world—“My brothers, see
what a Curse this True Love is ! Will you
not do all in your power to prohibit It and
make It impossible ?” The world, with one
consent, would label him Lunatic. Yet this is
exactly the false position the publicists are all
taking, on much weaker and quite untenable
premises, with regard to Drink. Why?
Because drink-fanaticism is an “accepted”
fallacy—a fallacy that is accepted as a truth
because intoxication is an uuconcealable, a
candid vice, and its follies are worn openly
on his sleeve by every sot. Had Blantern
drunk ten times as furiously as he did, and yet
had he never loved, probably he would not
have had his neck broken by the Common
Hangman. Had he never drunk and still loved
as violently as he did, he would probably not
have escaped the executioner. And, mixing
these luxuries, he went “ express ” instead of
“excursion” to his public doom. Not that
The Bulletin begrudges Blantern the small
final consolation of the self-deception which led
him to believe that, had he been temperate
with regard to Drink, he might have eluded
the Nemesis of an overdose of Love. But it is
the seeing man’s duty to warn off other self-
deceivers, and hold up to the light of exposure
this dreadful, blighting edrse, Love, whose
inevitable rewards are the Altar or the
Halter. Which is the worse ?
The Advantages of Foreign Capital.
One point on which the Fat Man is always
unanimous is that the “influx of foreign
capital” and the consequent “opening up of
the country ” are essential to the progress of
Australia. The Bulletin, on the other hand,
has invariably maintained that the influx of
foreign capital—unless the capitalist comes
along with it and settles permanently in the
country —is an unmitigated curse; that the
man who sends his money to this country for
investment is merely an absentee landlord of
the worst description ; and that—as Australia
has to pay exorbitant interest on the blessed
“influx”—the benefit to the country is just
the same as that which accrues to John Smith
labourer, when there is an influx of foreign
capital to the amount of 10s. into his weather-
board cottage, through his wife having taken his
coat to Aaron, moneylender. The pawn-
broker’s case, in fact, expresses the situation as
accurately as possible. When Queensland or
W.A. trades off a decent-sized province for a
song to a London syndicate, and “blews” the
proceeds, and then its inhabitants pay a
steadily-increasing rent—a rent which will one
day amount to thousands per cent—for the use
of the land which has thus been squandered
that is the “influx of foreign capital” on a
large scale. And when a haggard, gin-sodden
female takes the flat-iron to the Moses in the
next street, and gets Is. on it which she spends
in drink, and then keeps paying the interest till
the loan costs her 55., and finally loses the
flat-iron after all, that is the influx of foreign
capital on a small scale. But the result is the
same in either case.
* * *
The recent doings, in Westralia, of a com-
pany known as the Hampton Lands and
Railway Syndicate, are a fair example
of the advantages of “foreign capital.” The
syndicate is an English concern with offices in
London, and its profits go entirely to English
shareholders. It holds the lease of 1,340,000
acres on the Hampton Plains at a rental too
small to be worth mentioning. Also it has the
right to purchase the whole or part of its hold-
ing at the microscopic figure of 2s. fid. per
acre. The Hampton Plains syndicate has spent
not one penny on its immense holding. It has
neither fenced nor cultivated nor irrigated a
single acre. It hasn’t furnished employment
for a single Australian worker ; it has done no
good to anyone save itself; and up to date it
has only existed for the purpose of preventing
settlement on the vast area which it doesn’t use
and has no intention of using. Its sole object
was to wait until some private prospector,
who had successfully braved thirst and hunger
and the horrors of the desert, should find gold
or some other precious mineral on its land, and
then to purchase the auriferous region at 2s. fid.
per acre, and annex the results of his labour,
and throw him out into the desert. And, as a
further concession, the syndicate’s land is abso-
lutely free from all taxation until the year 1905,
which may quite possibly mean that it gets
back the whole of its miserable 2s. fid. per acre
in exemptions. Also, under certain circum-
stances, the same wretched half-crown is sub-
ject to 20 per cent, discount !
# # #
The time within which the purchase was
to be made expired in 1890, but as nothing of
value had been found, by other people’s labour,
up to that date, the W. A. Government obligingly
extended the time for three years without any
payment for the concession. Then Coolgardie
was discovered. The extreme end of the
Hampton Plains lease extends to within a mile
or two of Bayley’s Reward claim, and covers a
great part of Coolgardie, and the company has
bought up 216,000 acres of this region, in terms
of its agreement, at 2s. fid. per acre, making
£27,000 in all. It takes over, or steals, or
annexes, or whatever it may be called, many
reefs that have already been opened by the
adventurous pioneers of the desert, and collars
the gold—which is thrown in with the 2s. fid.
per acre, subject only to a trifling royalty of 2s.
per ounce ; and it only misses seizing the won-
derful Bayley’s Rew r ard claim by the mishap
which placed that mine a mile or so from its
boundary ! Further, it has got a new lease of the
other million acres or more of its original hold-
ing, so that it can definitely take them over
also when anything happens to make it worth
while to do so.
* * *
The whole amount of “foreign capital” which
this stupendous fraud upon posterity has intro-
duced into the country is the aforementioned
£27,000, and as all the company’s estate is
exempt from taxation for 12 years, this sum
will probably be lost by the Stale three times
over ! In fact, it is not a case of the company
introducing capital into the country, but the
country introducing capital into the company.
The Hampton syndicate doesn’t even pretend
to open up the land; it merely shuts it.
It affords no work ; the company doesn’t
employ a single man in agriculture, pastoral
pursuits, fencing, dam-sinking, building—any-
thing. It doesn’t propose to make one
blade of grass grow where it didn’t grow
before, or to reclaim one square foot of desert.
It simply proposes to lie low and levy toll upon
miners, agriculturists and others—to block the
way of settlement until it is bought off, and to
prevent anyone “opening up the country’
until he pays it for permission to do so.
Having sold this immense acreage the country
is already beginning the process of buying it
back at an enhanced price, and it will keep on
doing so until it has paid some 10,000 or 20,000
per cent, for the temporary use of the syndi-
cate’s £27,000. And this is not by any means
a solitary instance ; there are dozens of similar
companies and individuals in Westralia, and,
in fact, all over the continent, all engaged in
helping on the “influx of foreign capital.”
Most of the foreign capital has already been
repaid twice over, and it is repaid some more
every year, and it will keep on being repaid, to
all appearance, for ages to come, and yet the
whole amount is still owing, and keeps on that
way tor ever and ever. Australia has no curse
that can even begin to compare with the influx
of foreign capital.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Consider the Scandals, How they Grow!
A London paper, the Pall Mall Gazette,
describes the contempt of court sentence passed
upon the manager of Melb. Standard as an


extravagantly “impudent caricature of justice,”
which being applied to the work of the chief
Miia’te 0 f the Victorian Bench, is a somewhat
disquieting term. But what will be said pre-
L of the second magisterial hearing of that
\l old charge against Davies, Millidge and
2'\ For 30 odd weary days Mr. Nicholson,
py and his honorary colleagues have pre-
sided over an entertainment just as contemptible
as that of which Mr. Panton was the figure-
head six months ago. Sitting in Melb. District
Court for the ostensible purpose of considering
whether there be a prima facie case to submit to
a higher tribunal, they listen without protest
anything and everything of an irrelevant
character that defendants or their counsel like
to introduce. For hours at a stretch Matthew
Davies, talking for himself, and David Gaun-
jjj, talking at large on behalf of defendant
Millidge, are allowed to raise a dust of “ ob-
jections” and make strings of promiscuous
statements that have no purpose except to
blind the eyes of a stupid public to
the main point at issue. Was the Mercantile
Bank balance-sheet a perfectly honest docu-
ment, or does it admit of any reasonable belief
that the real condition of the bank was mis-
represented thereon ? That is the simple ques-
tion which the Law places before Mr. Nichol-
son and the honorary magistrates associated
with him in this miserable farce. They are
supposed to be occupied solely with the con-
sideration of a few bare facts, whereas they are
mostly listening to discussions about the finan-
cial position of a certain Mr. Cox, or to brazen
dissertations on the honesty of “Sir Matthew,”
the “dishonesty” of the late Mr. M‘Donald,
or any other extraneous matter that will serve
to kill time. The scandal of this wild gabbling
is the more scandalous because its purpose is
clear to every intelligent observer. In the first
place stands the necessity for dragging out
proceedings until Parliament has risen, so that
no member Murray, or Yale, or other “crank ”
may “embarrass the Government” by further
references to a miscarriage of justice. That the
old miscarriage will occur again, sooner or later,
seems quite understood. Already, at any
Collins-street corner one may hear mentioned
the names of patriotic gentlemen who are pre-
pared to spend hundreds of pounds in starting
fresh proceedings against Mr. Matthew Davies
when the 'present proceedings have been quashed.
Thequashing is regarded as inevitable in the event
of a committal taking place, whilst, as regards
the chance of a committal by the District Court
magistrates, it is pertinently suggested that no
unkind decision can be expected from a Bench
that has endured Gaunson and Matthew
Davies all this time. In Melbourne, too,
people talk artlessly of what would happen if
police-magistrate Nicholson were to say that
Matthew Davies is wort hy of trial by jury.
What ivovld happen !! ! Mr. Nicholson’s
brother, Panton, might consider himself
crashed, and Bryan O’Loghlen’s node prosequi
would smell stronger than ever. Collins-street
says that police-magistrate Nicholson is being
asked to find & prima-facie case against the Law
as well as against Davies and Co.—a terrible
duty to demand of a magistrate who, however
experienced and honourable, is but mortal,
after all.

The Matabele War,
Labouchere, in London Truth, thus sums
up the South African Chartered Co. and “that
speculating buccaneer, Cecil Rhodes ” :
“ la ” a S ed fo get a mining concession from Lobbn-
chnrO.?. d converted lb > b - v imperial connivance, into a
and h A m^ S ° rt ° f lonlahi P over Mashonaland
“I? l^ab® 1 ' 5 ! lnd . the consideration being that he should
make two Dukes lifo-dneclors of his company. There is

from I he free observation of prospecting
PvUr I ™P orta " t Sold-beanng reefs and alluvial deposits
with Vv,™ Therefore one thousand sharp-shooters, armed
, agazme-riflcs, and having with them machine-guns,
are to be turned loose on the Matabele nation. In such a
lfc J 8 stated our losses would be nil ; for we
snould keep to the open country, and constantly harass
the enemy by repeated attacks, and delivery of well-
..Vo-iuyS’ alwa - ys keeping beyond the range of
assegais. The operation, it is estimated, would cost about
nail a million, and owing to the rich gold deposits it would
P‘°,' ably P rove hl ghly remunerative. In plain language,
QBE GULA owns a gold-bearing country, and objects to
our taking the gold. Therefore, he and his people are to
th»fr? fc , Tbe however, explains
that the Matabeles are to be killed, because it is monstrous
at any Mashonas in the employ of our missionaries in
Mashonaland are to incur the risk of being shot by
Lobknqula s nnpis. To me, the worst feature in our
south African buccaneering is the hideous hypocrisy
beneath which we veil our greed for gold. It is like Mr.
Jabez Balfour appealing to Heaven to witmss the
philanthropy that actuated him when engaged in finan-
cing. The South Africa Chartered Co. is one of the worst
companies —in its financing aspect—that ever existed.
It ought never to have obtained a Royal Charter. It,
unfortunately, did so, and, as we have by granting it
accepted responsibilities, the least thing that we can do
is to take care that a gang of financiers do not murder
thousands of Matabeles, in order that the gang may "eb
hold of some gold reefs, and bring them out as rotten
companies.
-Che above was written before the war; now
the war has come to pass, and Labouchere’s
prophecies have been verified. The so-called
Matabele campaign has been mere butchery and
massacre. It was as much like real war as the
spectacle of an armed man booting a woman
or dancing on a worm, and it was just as valiant
as the pounding of a beef steak. And, in
addition to the open massacres with machine-
guns, it was ornamented by that curious episode
of the seizure and murder, by British soldiers,
of the Matabele envoys—a murder which is
feelingly described as a “ mistake,” but which
looks hideously like the precaution of a far-
seeing filibuster who, lest the embassy might
destroy all reasonable excuse for annexation,
wisely wiped out the ambassadors in good time,
but tiie utter brutality of the whole campaign
is in itself nothing specially characteristic.
Any European nation, or any other nation for
that matter, would have done the same with
just as little reason, and the Soudan Contingent
and the hundred Bendigo militia-men who
wanted to go out on an errand of gratuitous
murder in Matabeleland, are so many
evidences that Australia is prepared to do
likewise at the shortest notice. The truly
abject feature of the proceeding is the
British snuffle which accompanied the
machine-gun and the massacre—the drivel
about the necessity of protecting the helpless
Mashonas, of whom nobody took any account
until the gold discoveries in the Matabele
country made it worth while to take an interest
in their grievances, and the tears that were
shed over Lobengdla’s ferocity and the general
badness of his character. This is the really
British aspect of the case. Other nations are
as rapacious and as hungry after blood and
plunder, but Britain is the only one which
always sends the missionary in front, and
which bangs the brains out of the heathen with
the big Scripture rather than the sword, and
which always steals and kills and ravishes in
the name of the Lord. Britain, in fact, has a
bill of sale over the Lord, and a lien upon the
Almighty, and its flat-footed, black-coated,
black-hatted preacher has left a gory trail all
over the earth, and proved himself an anathema
and a fab precursor of death and destruction
wherever he went.
The High Wage and Eight-hour Curse,
John Bergan, a typical apostle of the Fat
Man’s creed, in a letter to S.M. Herald, thus
solves, in two sentences, the whole question of
poverty and depression ;
Let them be willing; and announce their willingness to
work 10 hours a day for half the present general rate of
wages, and there will not be an unemployed man in the
country within three months’ time. It is out of this
eight-hours’movement that the fog of unenterprise and
commercial depression which hangs over the country has
arisen.
There is not enough work available just now to
keep all the workers employed, and John Ber-
gan’s remedy for compulsory idleness is to get
that amount of work done by fewer hands, so
that more of the workers may be dispensed
with. Then his remedy for poverty is to reduce
wages one-half, which, seeing that great num-
bers of men don’t now average more than £ 1 per
week, means that they are be brought down
to 10s. And when these thi&gs have been done,
Bergan gives his own unsupported assertion,
payable three months after date, that there
will presently be not one “unemployed” in the
country. The man of Bergan’s description
somehow altogether ignores the fact that
wages have already been reduced one-half
or more—that he has got the very thing he
is shrieking after—and the consequence thereof
is that things have grown worse instead of
better. In a few trades there is still a feeble
pretence of keeping up the old rate of wages,
but these represent only an infinitesimal pro-
portion of the workers of the country. The
wages of the great mass have gone to utter ruin
anil desolation. The Bulletin knows of
situations which used to carry salaries of £8 a
week that are now adequately filled at 80s.
It knows of numbers of men who are working
for mere board and lodging, and it constantly,
comes across, in the papers, the abject appeal
of the man who wants to give his services in
return for a “ home ” or the price of one. Any
one can get infanticide done almost anywhere
in Australia now for thirty shillings—it is
actually worth while to take the chance of the
gallows for £1 10s. ; and a false witness can be
obtained for half-a-sovereign. Everything has
gone down with a thud except the wages
of bank-managers, high-class Civil servants,
liquidators, parsons, and other lofty individuals
of the class that is always writing to the
Herald to demand that other people’s incomes
should be reduced. And now that wages have
gone down 50 per cent, on an average, and the
change has produced nothing but misery, some
humourist of the BergAN species is invari-
ably on hand to announce that the only
remedy is another 50 per cent, reduction, and
that high wages and eight hours per diem are
the sole causes of the general distress. The
Bergans of this world cheerfully ignore the
fact that in England, where their remedy is in
full blast, the unemployed are more numerous,
according to population, and hungrier than in
Australia ; and that in India and China, where
hours are still longer and wages still lower, the
condition of the people is worse even than in
England.
Dear Bulletin, —You lately published a
letter of mine re the Member for Smith’s
Curse, and you answered it; but your
last leader only confirms my opinion, that to
those who can read between your lines the
word Centralism is stamped on every page
of your blushing journal. In your rabid
antagonism to provincial Bumble you show
yourself a rabid partisan of metropolitan
Boodle. You rave against the butcher, the
alderman, the Single-taxer, teetotaller, the
publican, the social puritan, the lawyer, the
editor, and the ‘ ‘ local ” man of any sort, and
you advocate an Upper House elected by the
whole province voting as one constituency. Do
you hold a brief for Sydney blatherskites, or
for globe-trotting adventurers who have not
sufficient ballast in them to “ settle ” anywhere
on God’s earth ? The “country” would have
no chance against the “ city ” with the province
voting as one constituency, and the result would
simply be a chamber of successful advertisers.
It is Smith’s Curse itself you object to, not its
member, and if the resident of this locality
bogged getting to his door, or had to quench his
thirst on putrid water, “ your ” troubles so long
as his representative did not mention such
unpleasant and such frivolous things in Syd-
ney to take up Sydney time or block Sydney
axe-grinding. Surely the influence of the unit
should radiate from himself outwards, and if so
why blaspheme the alderman, who need not
necessarily be a blood-stained butcher? Influence
or capacity must have a starting point, and it is
most illogical to assume that, having once started
the limit of its operation, must be bounded by a
parochial horizon. You curse all faddists, but
I think every living man must have a fad, and
if he doesn’t know it he’s a fool. May not a man
be an alderman, a teetotaller, or a Single-taxer,
or all of them, or a butcher even, and still be a
capable humanitarian, with a laudable desire to
gain the approbation of his fellow-men by work-
ing honestly for them ? You apparently would
think it right to hound such a man down.
Bulletin, I firmly believe that most fads are
better than the existing order of things. I
believe in most planks of your platform ; also,
that “land in usufruct should belong to the
living;” that “that which is best for the greatest
number is best for the whole with Hugo,
“ that man is the tadpole of an angel,” and
that his intelligence is perpetuated, and should
be used accordingly. Further, that it is the
duty of the State law-givers to confiscate and
repudiate existing rights rather than perpetuate
existing wrongs. I may stand for Parliament
some day (all men are fools), and be slated by
you because I am an alderman or a butcher,
and because I have the courage to say that I
believe you are a fraud, or at least very incon-
sistent, and that you have lost influence by
showing yourself negatively bigoted, and use-
fulness by venturing to put forward, as prac-
tical in political machinery, a second ballot.
Give us poor bushies a chance, and don’t growl
too much until you see what turns up next
elections.— Hugh Macdonald.
[Tub Bulletin keeps on objecting all the same to the
local politician. But wh..t its correspondent has alto-
gether failed to see is that it is the man with the local
soul, not the one with the local body, that it complains
of. Also, if the member for Smith’s Curse gets hogged
opposite his own door, or has to drink putrid water, The
Bulletin objects, just as Mr. Macdonald accuses it of
doing, to him mentioning these facts to the National
Legislature. That is Centralisation. Such things as these
should be mentioned to the Local Government body ex-
clusively. That is decentralisation. It is not The Bulle-
tin but Mr. Hugh Macdonald himself who is crying for a
centralising policy. This paper’s hatred of the alderman
is based on the factqthat he generally has a soul that is
only fitted to deal with his parochial drainage question,
and under the present system he comes to Sydney to talk
about it to 124 other men who listen with undisguised
impatience because each of them wants to be talking
about his own drainage question. By-theby, does Mr.
Macdonald mean to assert that the Second Ballot is not
“ practical in political machinery?” And, if so, why does
it work so well in the countries where it is in operation ?

Dear Bulletin, —Having particularly watched
the attitude of Q. Assembly towards electoral
reform, particularly re one-man-one-vote, the
following may be interesting to your readers.
As you know, Powers’ motion ” for electoral
reform, long before the House, has been lose on
division—23 for, 33 against, 2 pairs. “A
crushing defeat for the Labour party,” as the
Courier complacently remarked in a leader.
But compare the division-list of last year with
that of last week ! Last year, when Griffith’s
disfranchising Bill was in Committee, Powers
moved a new clause, providing that “No per-
son shall have his name on more than one
electoral roll.” This was negatived on division
by 44 to 12. The number of advocates of this
reform has thus more than doubled since 1892.
Further, in the recent divisions seven members
(most of them two-faced sneaks), pledged to
electoral reform, did not vote at all viz.
Boles, Curtis, Chataway, Cameron, Duffy’
Harding, and Jackson, thus increasing their
number to 31, or 19 more than last year.
Giving Government the benefit of the votes of
Messrs. Hamilton, Macfarlane, Burns,
Murray, and Thomas (all trimmers), who also
refrained from voting, the majority, in a full
house of 71 members, without the Speaker,
would only be 9 against one-man-one-vote,
being divided thus ;

fact that a New York firm had ordered
from a Parramatta (New South Wales) shipper
—“ two cases of lemons, as he thought there was

Likewise bully and rybuck! Also huzzah and

doled out cautiously—thousand by thousand—

death doesn’t fit the crime more than anvthing else,
unless Glasson is chopped up suddenly with an axe as
Phillips was. When one man kills another without an
instant’s warning, and then the law gives the assassin
three weeks to get ready for Heaven, the doctrine of an eye
for an eye is all burst up. The Bulletin advocates life-
long imprisonment for the utterly brutal murderer ;
you advocate a painless exit to Paradise. Do
you regard Paradise as an adequate punishment?...

which you state that he is a “ star,” a “ king of men,”
and a “ Washington,” and further mention that “Death

sension,” is declined. Cook, M.P., doesn’t profess to be a
star, or any other heavenly body, and such gush is stark
idiocy.... “H.S.R.”: Received “J.M.” (Sydney):
Sorry, but no man is going to rhyme “mines” with

the thing had been that wasn’t, then the thing that isn’t

A horrible thing, this convict sting,
O, brother Australian—-you—
For it whistles and sings where agony rings
Through the land of the kangaroo.
On the cross of logs the caitiff flogs,
And shuddering misery shakes

Brew venom of tiger-snakes.
The clumsy flail leaves a dreadful trail
From the city to Frying-pan Flat,
Where corruption lies that would noison flies,
From the ugly Australian oat.

The Italian Opera season, at Sydney
Lyceum, opened on Monday with “ I Pagliacci ”
in presence of a vast audience—mostly Hebrews.
Israel spends more money in dress-circle seats
than all the rest of the community put together;
without its countenance “ the Firm” might shut
right up. Except in the gallery, there was no
standing room anywhere in the big theatre,
and the show was a continuous burst of
enthusiasm. “I Pagliacci” is a fine sample of
condensed opera. The music is of the kind that
appeals to the multitude ; it is condensed, like the
opera, and not aggressively Marshall-Hallish, and
most of it is of the kind that people want to re-
member for a good while afterwards —but can’t.
The story is also condensed, like those compressed
novels of Bret Harte’s, in which everybody is
killed off in two pages, and you turn over the third
one to learn in three lines that the rain is pattering
drearily on a tomb. It would be spread out by
most writers into three hours of heavy wailing in
caves, with innumerable entrances and exits, and
long soliloquies by all manner of unauthorised
persons, but Leoncavallo puts it all in two acts,
and short ones at that. The principals of the
company, to whose recent Mel-
bourne appearances much space
has been devoted in these
columns, are even more re-
markable for their dramatic
abilities than for their ex-
cellent vocalisation ; and the
circle rose at them, and waved
the red silk handkerchief of
which the ticket had expired,
in a burst of enthusiasm,
which was probably one-half
real and one-half designed to
create a fictitious impression
that it was thoroughly vexed
in the Italian language.
* • *
As for the beautifully-
caparisoned Blue Ballet, the
public hasn’t yet made up its
mind whether Bartho or
D’Argo is to be its favourite.
The distinctly expressed
opinion of the circle on Mon-
day night was that it didn’h
get enough of either of these
ladies. There was just enough
of them to make the audience
moderately intoxicated, and
so it felt ill-used, and has
thoughts of seeing the “ firm”
about the matter.
* * *
Sydney Opera House,
which of late has had many
long attacks of darkness, in-
terspersed with sudden re-
openings when the unripe
ghost has walked feebly on
one leg, suffered another of
its fitful re-appearances op
Saturday. That old and tried
favourite, Edward Farley, was
thecauseof the awakening, and
“ Fatinitza ” was 4ie open-
ing piece. “Fatinitza” has
few catchy tunes of the kind
that are barrel-organed in the
street, but still it contain!
some very pleasant musio
and a reasonable amount of
comedy. Most of the honours
lie with Miss Cecily Staun-
ton, as Fatinitza. In her
male costume the lady
is a comparative failure—she
somehow looks cheap and un-
real in pants and a helmet—
but in skirts she is a winsome kind of she-Bashi-
Bazouk with a voice like a bell, and her acting is
good throughout—especially when she confidenti-
ally mashes Isset Pasha’s harem, while that
beguiled and fatuous Turk is away drinking with
a lying reporter. Mr. Farley’s Russian general is
also a high-class performance, and the song in which
he announces his views upon flogging takes well
with a right-thinking audience. Also, there are
good points about the drinky Pasha ; and Walsh’s
lying correspondent is accurate, though somewhat
colourless, and seems to wish he were dead ; and
Joe Stark, as a Russian soldier with a powerful
Irish accent, is an insult to common sense; and
the only objection to Miss Edith Moore is that,
while she sings well, she entirely forgets to act.
Also, there is something incongruous about the
spectacle of a lady in a tailor-made British frock
with two flounces, struggling with several tons of
robust Turks by the Isagen Danube. Still,
“ Fatinitza ”is a deserving show, if only for the
sake of Cecily Staunton and the view of Odessa in
the third act.
»* * *
The “ Romany Rye ” will run some time
longer at Sydney Her Majesty’s. The drama is
still as incoherent as The Bulletin accused it of
being in last week’s issue, but about the magni-
ficent staging of it there is no possible doubt
whatever, and even if it collapsed altogether as a
drama it would probably get through on its
merits as an oil-painting only. Also, this paper’s
opinion of Mrs. Rignold’s Mother Shipton keeps
rising steadily, mainly because she is such a
tender and motherly old drunk in her cellar, and
gets the poison ready so affectionately.
| J Despite the aggravated venerableness of
the Irish drama, and the fact that the loathsome
informer isn’t nearly as fresh as he used to be,
“ Arrah-na-Pogue ” has done two weeks of profit-
able business at Sydney Royal, and will only be
taken off with extreme reluctance to make room
for “ The Golden Giant ”on Saturday. This un-
naturally elongated capitalist has never yet been
seen in Sydney, but The Bulletin has the per-
sonal assurance of old friend, Manager Fred.
Gunther, that the drama is of much merit.

Coogee Aquarium makes anew departure
by dropping into Sunday opera. Next Sabbath
the second act of “ Maritana” will be given, with
Messrs. Jules Simonsen, Wentworth, and other
good names in the bill; and if the project meets
with due encouragement, the management will
probably advance to whole operas later on. To-
day’s (Thursday’s) programme includes a water
pantomime, which is a nice, cool thing, and well-
adapted to the weather.

Melbourne had five theatres open on
Saturday last, but this reckless experiment is un-
likely to be repeated during the present century.
Derby Night was expected to at
least a faint reminiscence of its old biz. The
back of the “Carnival” might be injured, yet
the gaudy thing was not extinct —said the show-
men. For theatrical purposes^there is very little
Carnival left in the city, judging from the grue-
some experience of Four of the
managements might have combined to plank all
their takings on one horse for the Gup, without
bringing the selected animal to a short price.
Even the Waxworks, an historic place of rest for
country visitors, presented a gaping vacuum on
this mournful occasion.
WE ELECTED IT AS A REPUBLICAN!—AND JUST
LOOK AT IT NOW!!
“ The Magistrate,” at the Princess’s,
headed the poll by a large majority. The story of
the fraudulent youth who took his step-father out
on the loose is a joy for ever, and a crowded house
expressed that sentiment in the usual manner.
Brough’s portrait of respectability gone astray was
perhaps a little better (and muddier at the finish)
than it used to be; also, George Carey’s police-
sergeant was a distinct improvement on all the
sergeants who have gone before. Otherwise the
B. and B. company, in this old success, came up
to the old standard of excellence. “Niobe” is
the bill for to-night (Thursday), and “A Village
Priest,” of revered memory, will start a week’s
Win on Saturday.

Arnold, who is putting in three absolutely
last nights of “Hans” at the Bijou, hopes to
score heavily with a new musical comedy-drama
on Saturday next (11th). The piece, “Captain
Fritz,” was specially constructed for Arnold and
his German accent. It includes songs said to be
of the haunting, catchy character, which will
provide a certain whistling advertisement for the
show that introduces them to notice. The Bijou
needs a good sound advt. of that kind.
** * *
The Alhambra is much less empty than
some of the rival establishments these times, A
“new first part” has one great advantage oyer
the legitimate drama in being open to receive
topical allusions. Casual mention of the horse
that won, incidental to a dance of jockeys or a
grand bookmakers’ chorus, elicits a double
whilst a conundrum founded on Camoola workg
wonders upon a sixpenny gallery. Alhambra pro-
grammes conclude always with a favourite farce,
and the farce is bound to finish with a riot. The
audience understands this fact so thoroughly that
it rises en masse as soon as the chief comedian
commences to assault his aged father-in-law with
a plate of soup, and before there is time for a full
cast to hurl one another out of a window, most of
the gratified spectators are slinking silently away.

Thursday being the Heir Apparent’s natal
day, the Jubilee Singers have undertaken to
appear at Melbourne Athenaeum and celebrate the
same by starting a “grand farewell season.”

Gourlay and Walton, at Melbourne Royal,
contrive to knock a lively entertainment out of
“Skipped by the Light of the Moon.” Although
this aged nightmare, by Pantomime —Chaos, has
been running in all sorts of company for the last
eight years, it can generally make a bold show
when walloped with energy and determination.
On Saturday the animal went very freely from
start to finish, and backers had no cause for com-
plaint. “Skipped” is quite likely to stay for
another week.

"The Alexandra was open on Saturday for
the alleged purpose of giving a benefit to John
Wallace, but the admirers of that old public
servant mostly failed to turn up. The benefit-bill
turned out to be a thing of shreds and patches
intermingled with gaps of solitude. Dull misery
stalked into the theatre at an early hour and
remained weeping on the bare back benches until
the last brave Mohican spectator had petered out
of the premises. It is understood that Wallace
will console himself by taking another, and a
proper, benefit at the first opportunity.

On Monday next a Miss Di. Bloustein will
give a “debut performance” at the Alexandra,
appearing.as Pauline in “Lady of Lyons” under
the experienced direction of J. F. Cathcart.
At Poverty Point.
Violet Varley, who sometime ago was understood to be
engaged to a Sydney commercial man, is, it is just
announced, to marry tenor Tapley. It has been quite
clear to The Bulletin for a fortnight past that she rather
liked Tapley from the vicious way she slashed him with
her riding-whip in the first act of “Mascotte," and the
angelic manner in which Joseph stood the switching.
One of the Melb. fashionable amateur theatrical clubs
is “ run ”by a young lady billed as stage-manager. The
love-scene rehearsals must be funny. It would interest
men to hear a woman’s explicit directions in such
matters.
In Melbourne, amateurs swarm like locusts, darkening
the heavens and casting a shadow upon the land. Miss
Aimde Moore, amateur, has had a “society” testimonial
benefit which realised some £2OO and will enable her to
play Juliet professionally for the rest of her natural life.
By way of contrast, a poor society-artist, who got his leg
broken in a street accident, and was reduced to zero of
poverty, “ benefited " the other day, and got—well, per-
haps he got 10s.
Albani ascribes the fine preservation of her voice to he* 1
strong control over her tongue. If she has to sing much
at night she keeps her mouth closed all day, except for
light-refreshment purposes. What an example for poor
old hoarse Antoinette, who was quiet only when her
cannie Scotch husband tied a silk-handkerchief round her
jaws !
Billy Elton gets scant praise from the weeklies for his
comic Jew character in the latest Drury Lane drama—
“ A Life of Pleasure.” Some of them don’t even mention
h’s name. It is safe to bet that Elton now considers Aus-
tralia the grandest and most intelligent country on earth.
The Lyric Club (Melb.) represents amateurism in its
ghastliest guise. The concern is sickbed o’er with a pale
pretence of social distinction, utterly at variance with the
fact that a recent leading lady is looking for an “engage-
ment,” and that a minor member dances in the Blue
Ballet. At rehearsal the club’s polite fiction is much
intensified by a superior official, who opens proceedings
in this style—“ Hands up, all who are going to Govern-
ment—haw ! —House on Monday neiight. Hands up, all
who are going to Government House on Wednesday
neiight.” A number of pretentious paws are held up each
time as a matter of course, and the official looks
worried. “Her leddyship is very keind, but really she
forgets that we have work to do. Our new operaw,
really.” These culchawed creatures are just now strug-
gling with “ Cloches de Corneville,” or “ Lay Klosh,” in
Toorak-French pronunciation.
Those “smoke-concerts” at the Himperial Hinstitoot
are neither more nor less than variety-shows, managed
by Didcott, the music-hall agent. Old Mrs. Miller, of
Meioourne, ths ’’ beneficent donor," will be proud to
learn that she might as well have squandered money on a
peal ot bells for the Alhambra or Troc.
Tenor Qiraud is rather contemptuous of Australian
admiration for the drinking-song in “Cavalleria,’’ which,
he says, never gets an encore in Italy. The difference in
musical taste is here accounted for by the difference in
drinking habits between two races of people. This ditty
has a certain alcoholic swing about it which goes to the
heart of every audience that speaks the English language.
Also, there is a chorus in the case, and the Hempire is
built on choruses.
You will be spared the music-hall, New Cut, refinement
of Miss Jenny Hill, who contemplated taking an Austra-
lian engagement, remarks The B.’s London correspondent.
She has been induced to forego that idea, and has signed
for a South African tour under Luscotnbe Searelle. Com-
pared with Jenny, Bessie Bellwood is gentility itself.
A Sydney “ legitimate ” actress was, a short while ago,
on the variety stage. As she crossed the Domain the
other day half-a-dozen gamins began an air to which she
used to high-kick. “ Say, Miss,” said one urchin, “when
yer goin’ back to Rickards’ ? My, but yer can kick I”
“ Garn,” said another, “ she’s a hactress now. She don’t
kick no more.” B„ut she did, and that youth just felt it.

Speaking of the agony ballet-girls suffer on account of
their feet, a physician said recently: “The premieres if
they appear twice the same evening, invariably have a
chiropodist back of the scenes to attend th«m between
aots. It is peculiar, but ballet-girls tret corns under their
great toe-nails. This, of course, would prevent them *rom
dancing, but we have a way,of treating such things. We
split the toe-nail down the centre and place cotton between
this and the oorn. This has to be dressed after each
dance. I have seen a premiere danseuse come off the
stage smiling and fall down in a faint as soon as she was
out of sight of the audience, all caused by the pain in her
feet.’’—Ex. [And does the adorable Bartho really sulit,

Frances Saville (writes Thu Bulletin's London corres-
pondent by last mail) appears in public for the first time
at the Promenade Concerts to morrow. She will sing the
music of the mad scene from Lucia, and Billy Barrett
who plays the flute obligato, says she will give them all
“the knock."
It is announced that Haddon Chambers has finished a
play for the Haymarket, on which he has been working
for twelve months in retirement at Birchington-on-Sea
He will be lucky, remarks Tub Bulletin’s correspondent
if he has it produced within another year, for H. A. Jones 1
play, “ The Tempter,” is in possession, and Tree has
others ready when that ceases to attract.
O. W. Anson, wo hear, draws £2O a week from Tree at
the Haymarket, and has just eight lines in “The
Tempter.” He succeeded Harry Kemble who declined
the same part and the same pay.
H. H. Vincent and Plain Bill Holloway are, we regret

A Johannesburg paper criticising Signor Foli’g render-

brogue is exceptionally remarkable in one born and bred
under soft Italian skies."
A popular ornament of the comio-opera stage, who left
her husband some years ago for well-known reasons, was
reconciled to him abroad last year with a very common
consequence. As hubby denies paternity the beauteous
one returns to the Antipodes to, as she threatens
commence divorce-proceedings for desertion.
The Italian Opera Co. and its blue ballet were ten nights
in Adelaide. They left after the performance on Wed
night (Nov. 1), played Thurs. and Friday in Ballarat and
then took another special to Sydney, The extra prices
charged in the circle seriously affected that part of the
house during the Adelaide season.
Somebody (not to mention names) very neatly got at
a certain uninstructed theatrical lessee. It was repre-
sented( to the guileless one that he could not get a certain
“par.” inserted in, a certain paper unless he paid £3O
and bought 1000 copies of the issue in which it appeared
The virgin theatre-man actually did pay the £3O, and
commissioned the person to purchase 1000 copies. Here
the joke uplifts itself. The person, who had read Mark
Twain to advantage, thereupon went and sold those 1000
copies at a clear profit (to himself) of £l5. Net result to
the person of £45. This happened in—Maoriland.
In “The Other Fellow',” a farcical adaptation from the
French by Fred. Horner, lately produced at the Court
London, the general emasculation which the original has
undergone in deference to British prudery has only per-
mitted of the survival of one mildly risqud situation
understood by Parisian audiences, but the suggestive-
ness of which is lost upon the stolid Briton. A young
wife receives a visit from an old suitor in the absence of
her husband. As they sit in the drawing-room exchang-
ing double entendres on the subject of the absent spouse,
from the mantelpiece comes the sound of— aouckooclock.
London is suffering from a “farm-yard” artist who
announces—“My next will be a himitation of an ’en
layin’ a hegg.”
Adelaide musicians vote “L’Amico Fritz” to be the
best of the Italian repertoire. The musio is distinct and
even more melodious than that of “Cavalleria” and
“ Pagliacci." The pastoral chorus is a beautiful work,
and perhaps the gem of the opera.
Ic has been mentioned that Max O’Rell had his bank-
draft of £3OOO, from Australia, impounded through the
bank’s suspension. The draft has just been paid in full.
Amateur tenor Roland M. Cunningham, brother of the
Argus Cunninghams, and of the well-known Sydney
official reporter, benefits in Melb. Then ho ! for London.
Nellie Farren improves in health, but her illness has
left her a wan, feeble, hollow-eyed little woman with a
look of profound sadness on her countenance, and judging
by her appearance she will never go high-kicking any
more. She wants to go into “serious comedy,” but it is
questionable if she isn’t too depressed even for that.
Julia Matthews’ son is managing Charles Hawtrey’s
company, which is not doing very well, in South Africa.
He thinks of coming on to Australia.
Santley, under Carlyle Smythe, followed Max O’Rell in
South Africa and boomed all along the line. “The much-
travelled junior is in London now helping the Governor
in his search for celebrities. It is said that Charles Clark
will visit the Cape early next year under the young-un’s

From Pastor Fitohett’s Melb. Evening Herald:—
“ Dear Mrs. Brough,
Don’t think it rough

If the good pastor really wants to know, it was David
Jones and Co., of Sydney.
Now that the guardians of the little girl
M'Whannell have accepted half of their £3OOO
verdict against the N.S.W. Railway Commis-
sioners, in order to avoid the ruinous expense of a
new trial, The Bulletin would like to know if
anything is going to be done to the Full Court on
a charge of “ intimidation.” The plaintiff got her
verdict from a jury. It wasn’t overset by any
legal process, and if a new trial had been
granted it is quite as likely as not that
the original verdict would have been upheld
with costs. The plaintiff’s representatives, how-
ever, were intimidated into abandoning half the
amount awarded them, by the virtual threat—for
that was really what it amounted to—that they
would otherwise be ruined by litigation. Suppose
this kind of thing were applied to criminal
proceedings—say, that when an embezzler had
been sentenced to four years’ imprisonment he
were brought up again and told: “Prisoner,
you have been sentenced to four years in
gaol. There is, however, a chance that
other charges will be brought against you, and
even if you are entirely innocent the costs of
your defence will probably ruin you. You had
better agree at once to take eight years in gaol
and call it square, for if you don’t you may get
eight years anyhow, and be made bankrupt into
the bargain.” This would only be the logical out-
come of the court’s attitude in the M'Whannell
case, though the court may perhaps be unaware of
the fact. John Haynes is to test the Legislature’s
feeling on the subject by moving that £ls’ 0 be
placed on the estimates as additional compensation
to the girl. He will get the vote of every man
who is fit to be in Parliament as a representative
of the common people and as a champion of public
liberties against the arbitrary encroachments of
“the Law.”

Tooth’s Brewery Cos. (Sydney) pays a dividend

looks a cheering result for the owners of the tanglefoot

Is it £42,500 cash or bonds, or simply £42,600 worth more

The “arrangement” of the Colonial Finance,
Mortgage, Investment, and Guarantee Cosporation,
Limited, has been judicially upset owing to some
informalities, and the business has to be gone over again.
The strange feature about the Colonial, ko., is that it has
only £29,000 deposits and £287,000 ol other liabilities,
yet it professes to reckon confidently on being able to
pull through if it gets time from its depositors.

There is a difficulty between the Yic. Govern-
ment and the Bank of Victoria, which, along
with some other institutions, holds £30,000 trust
money deposited by the Master in Equity. The Cabinet
claims that this amount is a Govt, deposit, and should
have priority over other deposits ; the bank replies that
it is an ordinary deposit reconstructable with the rest.
giate-Treas. Carter is also a director of the Bank of Vic-
toria, so he represents both sides of the dispute—in one
capacity he demands that the money shall be paid ; in the
other he will see himself, in his first capacity, darned
before he will part. He has had several exceedingly
unpleasant interviews with himself on the subject, and
on one occasion nearly offered himself personal violence,
but nothing satisfactory resulted. Now he is going to
take legal proceedings against himself for the recovery of
the amount, and he is reported to be so incensed against
himself on account of this arbitrary conduct that he has
been compelled to warn the messengers at the Treasury
not to let him in if he calls, lest he should rush into
his own office and attack himself in a way that is
calculated to provoke a scandal.

The Colonial Bank—of which Baronet Clarke
and his brother are the leading lights—shows a profit of
£5965 for the first quarter since it was born again. Of
this, £3595 goes to pay a 5 per cent. div. to preference
shareholders, and a balance of £2370 is carried forward.
The balance is equal to a profit of 2J per cent, per annum
to the ordinary shareholder. Next to being disembowelled,
it is a great thing to be an ordinary re-oonslruoted bank
shareholder these times.

which absorbs £474 4s. 6d., and shows a balance of £1694

the ordinary capital of £500,000. Regarded as cheerful

The curse of the irredeemable paper currency
has come to stay in N.S. Wales. Premier Dibbs’ new
Banking Bill provides that notes shall be legal tender
throughout the country and shall be redeemable in gold
only at the head offices in Sydney. This is equal to making’
one-half, or more than half, of the note-issue absolutely
inconvertible. Anybody, of course, can get gold by

would fade away and turn into paper again whenever he
went back to the region of irredeemable currency—it
follows that, for all practical purposes, the alleged
securities might as well be payable in Central
Asia or on the Barrier Reef. The present Bill
is to be rushed through before the end of the
session. Premier Dibbs has another Bill on hand, to
place the whole issue of paper-money under Government
control, but that isn’t to be rushed through this session.
Instead, it will come along gradually next vear, or in a
century or two. This is characteristic of'N.S. Wales

Treason-Felony Act through in a few hours, but he was so

The objection to the new Banking Bill is
simply that it makes the currency of the greater part of
the province depend entirely on the solvency of a nutpber
of private institutions, most of which have just been in-
solvent. And, considering all that has been said about
the “restoration of confidence,” it is a dismal thing that
the Government should begin, for the second time, to try
its hand at making confidence compulsory. Also, after
the cheerful assurances that there would be no necessity
to renew the legal tender proclamation for another six
months, and that specie payments were about to be re-
sumed, it is a gruesome anomaly to find specie payments
being permanently abolished over the greatest part of
N.S. Wales, and the unsecured IOU system coming to
be a permanent institution in the land.

Lurid letter from Ooolgardie, Australia’s latest

12 Mile Olay Pan,
Near Ooolgardie, W.A., Oct. Ist, 1893.
Dear ,—Just a few lines to let you know 1 am
still in this sun-scorched sand-desert, camped at a clay-
pan, keeping the horses alive till it ends, which will be
about two more weeks. Then, O Lord, what will happen?
There are at present about 2000 men on this field—all
round the poorest patch, I believe, ever found in Aus-
ralia. About 1900 of them are cursing John Forrest,
the newspapers, and W.A. in general. Flour is Is. per
lb., sugar Is. 3d., tea 35., beef (rotten) Is., and water, or
thin mud, 2s. per gal. About 100 men on the field are
getting or making tucker; about 1900, nothing. Yet
there are hundreds coming in every week._ 1 also hear
there are hundreds walking the streets in Perth and
Freemantle, to say nothing of the gaols, which are full. The
Govt, is also giving a bonus this year for deep sinking—
public money, you know—in order to let the Southern Cross
mines try their ground. The six families hold most ot them.
All these are backed up by newspapers, edited by the
most ignorant and degraded sons of Belial on record.
Just fancy the editor of the Western Maui actually advo-
cating a tax on “ ’tother siders” 1 He says they tax
sheep and oattle coming into W.A., why not men 7 There
are hundreds landing from Victoria with their families
and outfits—waggons and horses. They will find out that
not only have they to fetch their tucker from the other
side, but they will have to buy water in this desert to cook
it with. Well, for myself, 1 have been up here since June
and have got exactly 18oz. ot gold—bank value, £3 12s. 6d
per oz., and lost two pack-horses. 1 loaded up in Cool-
gardie at a cost of £2l 175.; reckon tucker and £3 for
horseshoes and harness, and you can get an idea of my
profit. I am one of the exceedingly lucky ones, never
having to buy any water, always “packing” my own. To
get that gold I have been in five different rushes during
the time the rain was on. Now they are all worked out
and the water is done. lam studying where to head for
before the collapse comes. About 40 of us, all camped
with horses, are having about three meetings every day.
Some propose the coast, others the Murchison, and all
would go to Africa if we could sell our horses, but we can’t,
nor can we carry them away. Just tell me what you think
of Africa when you write, and also whether it was at the
Cape or Transvaal you were at. I see the South Africa Cos.
has lively times ahead. There might be a bit ot plunder
if a man had uniform on. [Are you listening, ye Bendigo

FOR PROOF READ THIS
Mr. E. Suttel, baker, Yowaka, N.S.W., who
writes on May 3rd, 1893 About*twelve months
ago I had a severe attack of influenza attended by
bronchitis. I had the attendance of a medical man,
but deriving no benefit from the remedies I
received from him, and hearing so much about the
cures performed by Clements Tonic, I resolved to
give it a trial. I omitted to mention above the
various symptoms from which I was suffering,
viz : —severe headache, complete loss of appetite,
and extreme want of sleep, accompanied by sore
throat, and a continual wheezing when breathing.
Before I h;id finished the first bottle of Clements
Tonic all disagreeable symptoms had disappeared.
I am only too happy to say that 1 have never had
to use any other medicine since, and you will
never find my house without Clements Tonic.—
Yours, etc., E. Suttel, baker, Yowaka, N.S.W.
I hereby certify to the above being a correct
statement. —A. Francis, cordial manufacturer.

A Sydney parson has just forbidden the

Max O’Rell, The Bulletin hears, has not

Henniker Heaton’s eldest son, Jack, is

Premier Nelson (Q.) professes, and that

Someone hints that “General” Booth,
W. M‘Lean’s Melb. guest, was the real generous

The wealthy Sydney brewer, J. S. Mit-
chell, does not appear to have left a single stiver

At a Western (N.S.W.) Circuit Court
recently, the Sheriff’s Officer, swearing-in an in-

toll him that he was required to interpret cor-
rectly from the English to the Colonial, and from
thi Colonial to the English, so help his God!
Chief Justice Darley, with much dignity, set him
right.

“ Who is the woman?”
It is just as often :
“Which was the

Parkes, who is reported to have told a
parson at a late banquet that he supports the
Church—from outside—as a buttress, has for
years on census papers, &c., described himself as a
“Protestant Christian.”
J. A. Macpherson, barrister and squatter,
who, in ’69 70, was Vic. Chief Secretary for seven
months and when his Govt, was defeated took
office in the next Cabinet, has been living in Lon-
don for nearly 20 years.
Of a certain Australian-in-England, now in

The oldest inhabitant of Bathurst, N.S.W.,
Bricklayer Hobbs, aged nearly 90 years, has been

An English litterateur, author of over a
dozen novels, sends a circular around the Aus-
tralian provincial press, offering two columns of
original matter for half-a-crown a column. In his

S.A. Premier Kingston’s pet aversion is
the quadrille, which he is bound by etiquette to

Treasurer Playford when delivering a Budget

Alex. Brysen, the 13-year-old murderer
whose death-sentence N.S.W. Executive lately
commuted, wrote to a Sydney newspaper while
his case was pending : “ If you put my picture in
your paper make a curled moustache on it and
show I don’t care.”
A well-to-do Lothario, fulfilling an appoint-
ment with the daughter of an eminent Australian
professional man and detected by her father in the
house late at night, is doing a term of hard labour,
having pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary
preferred against him.
Touching the offer of India’s vice-royalty
to our old friend, a London paper says, “ As for
Lord Carington, he vastly prefers his situation as
professor of dancing and deportment to the
Cabinet (by special appointment) to misruling the
mild Hindoo.” Nevertheless, Nautch girls are
distinctly nice.
A miser, who died lately at Pambula,
N.S.W,, aged 82, had lived by himself for 34
years. Among his belongings was found .£3OOO
iu bank-deposit receipts and cash. The only
cooking utensils he possessed were two jam-tins—
one used as a tea-billy; in the other he boiled
his beef, cut into very small pieces.
Solicitor Waldron, lately appointed to the
Sydney City Solicitorship, has it in his favour
that he is a man of general education and infor-
mation, as well as a police-court authority. He is
an M.A., and was the first articled-clerk to avail
himself of the law_ which enabled such pupils to
attend Sydney University lectures.
A back-blocks attorney who does much
business amongst the Chinese never allows a
Mongol client to be sworn upon a lighted match
or a broken saucer. Each witness must decapitate
a cock. Quite recently the lawyer and the Court-
keeper divided a dozen fat, young roosters between
them as the result of a day in court.
Gov. Gormanston is Tasmania's champion
“hard case.” On a recent Sunday morning he
rode through Hobart Domain from church in a
carriage with his private secretary beside him and
a lady vis-d-vis with her back to the horses. As
a further shock to many onlookers the worthy
representative, of “ Royalty ” was seen to be
smoking.
In 1852 W. J. Foster arrived in Victoria
and went to Bendigo. In ’53 his cousin, John
Foster M'Creight, followed him, and was called
to the Southern Bar. Both not long afterwards
left. M’Creight later on went to British
Columbia, and Foster returned to Australia. Both
are now Judges—one at Vancouver, and the other
at Sydney.

Henniker Heaton’s bogey-man, Sir Arthur
Blackwood, late real chief of the British Post-

London papers say that Queensland’s next
Governor will be Thurston, of Fiji— life
as a ship’s cook—whose term in his present loca-
tion expires in a month or two ; and that he will
be succeeded in Fiji by Gov. Maogregor, of New
Guinea. *“He would suit the Queenslanders well
enough and be particularly useful in connection
with the re-established Kanaka labour traffic.”
Eor this very reason the Kanaka Government of
Q. won’t want Thurston. He knows too much.
It may interest a certain Australian
potentate to learn that the “ testimonial ” (a life-
sized portrait of himself), which was lately pre-
sented to him with great stage-effect, was for some
time in pawn to a well-known Israelite for ,£3O,
pending the gathering-in of the subscriptions.
An experienced reporter was talking, the
other day, about the so-called political orators of
Australasia. Said he : Apart from Deakin, only
two have the slightest claim to such a title. One
is Gov. Kintore and the other Capt. Russell, who
was one of the Maoriland representatives at the
Federal Conference.
“ William Lawson Dash,” N.S.W. teetotal
panjandrum, opens his letter to daily paper :

Wales takes up all the time I can fairly give to temperance
work, yet, etc.
“High,” “grand,” “grand!” Glory, glory,
glory ! Lemonade hardly ever seems to agree
with grammar.
Bathurst (N.S.W.) Advocate, after a
physiognomical analysis of the condemned Glas-
son’s photo., finds in it several indications of
brutality and bloodshed. The old, old story.
Glasson, no matter how bad he may be, would
get quite as many votes at a beauty-show as his
pre-mortem dissector. “ Once place a man behind
these spikes,” said advocate Dailey at the trial of
murderer Scott, “and his face becomes a face
that expresses every passion.”
Mrs. Reeve, a daughter of William Charles
Wentworth, died a few weeks ago, in England,
Her husband was one of those lucky people who,
coming out to Australia with a little spare cash,
bought land, waited, and became enormously rich.
He owned the land on which the Pitt-street
frontage of Sydney Post-office is built, and Sandy
Campbell, M'Culloch and Paling made a bit out
of the business. There was a long arbitration over
the price to be paid, but, of course, Govt, got the
worst of it.
Everybody in N.Q., a few years ago, knew
the Rev. Bobby B . Bobby was very illiterate
and some of his faux pas were beautiful. On one
occasion he gave a recitation to a local debating
society, and some of the members criticised him
rather keenly. Said one youthful pedant: “Mr.
B ’s articulation is defective; the consonants
he pronounces clearly, but the vowels are not open
enough.” Uprose the Rev. Bobby : “Mr. Chair-
man, this gentleman’s remarks is simply ridiculous.
I can’t see what keeping my bowels open has got
to do with the way I speak !” And the members
howled for joy.
There is a specially alert young Australian
in London, one Henry French de Freyne French —
which, translated into common English, means
Henry French, son of Edward French, a well-
known old Victorian. This young gentleman
went to England several years ago, and some-
how was adopted by Lord de Freyne, hence
the names in front of his original one. He
has been fortunate in marriage, having espoused
a Miss Thursby, one of the Lancashire
Thursbys, who has some .£4OOO or =£sooo a
year. Henry, &c., &0., is now, therefore, a bit of
a potentate. He is an honorary page, or some
thing, at the Vatican, though his forbears were all
t’other way of religious thinking.
Henry Lucy, in S.M. Herald, confirms
the statement circulated long since, that ere set*
ting out on his fatal voyage to the States,
“ Abingdon ” Baird instructed his solicitors to
make a will leaving to Mrs. Langtry every penny
he possessed. “A day was appointed on which
he was to call and sign the document. He did not
present himself till after dinner, and was then in
such a state that his solicitors, an eminent London
firm, declined the responsibility of witnessing his
signature. He sailed next day for New York,
died in New Orleans after a prolonged debauch,
and the Lily was left lamenting. She is not with-
out expectation that, since ‘ The Squire’s ’ inten-
tion was unmistakeable, its expression lacking
only the formality of his signature, those who
benefit by the accident may compromise the aFair
by paying her a round sum in cash.”
Dear Bulletin, —lf “Delcomyn” ridicules
the idea of a man in his senses being deceived by
the mirage, why did he write in his “ The Aus-

following line
The delusive mirage the traveller mocks ?

HENRY GYLES TURNER.
In Bombay Presidency two natives of the
same name were under sentence of death in two
different gaols. The Executive reprieved one and
confirmed the other’s sentence. The telegrams,
however, got mixed—the reprieved man was
hanged and the other man wasn’t. At latest no-
body was to blame.
When “Bob”
Sefton was on his
way to Coolgardie,
some Ballarat mining
friends asked him to
let them know if
there was any show
for a machine there —
if so, to select a site
for them. He wired
back: “Don’t dream
of coming here I
have in my water-bag
the only water at
present in the dis-
trict.”
Quong Tart, the
prosperous Sydney
Chinese restaurateur,
has a white wife and
three children two

boy is the youngest.
Both the girls were
baptised in the Pres-

boy, however, is an
Anglican. “Why?”
—someone asked the
happy father. “Well,”
replied Quong, “it
just this way : I want
boy to be cunning, so
I take him to be
clis’ened by Levelend

Faith.—The measure of a man’s ignorance. .
Hope.—The expectation of something
better for ourselves than others have.

Victoria is the paradise of the kirking-clan,
and the Eldorado of roguery.
The biggest lobbyist in N.S.W. Parliament
is a “ natural-opportunity ” man.
Premier Patterson (imperiously): “ Have
we done nothing, then ?” Ay ; the People.
Of a certain N.S.W. Minister it has been
remarked that never before has there been a man
with so thick a head possessed of so thin a skin.
Glassey, Queensland ex-Labour leader, and
M'llwraith, his political foe, both _ bound for
health are timed to meet face to face in America.
Purves, Q.C. : “Wealthy hypocrisy can
walk down Gollins-street, put its thumb to its
nose and spread out its fingers at the law of the
land.”
A N.S. Wales M.P. who has lately espoused
pronounced democratic sentiments, was last week
notified by his bank that he must keep himself in
credit without fail.
Somebody professes to have a private
letter lately written by Parkes, in which the
N.S.W. Labour members are spoken of as
“political gamesters.”
The Age, on the land question, makes one
giddy. It has had a turn for the better, and
again vaunts the tax on unimproved land-values
as scientific taxation.
Asked for which candidate she would vote
at the coining Maoriland general elections, a
Napier young lady promptly answered: “Mr.
Gladstone, to be sure.”
Parkes : “ We are not yet ripe for throw-
ing open the ports of Australia.” Anything is
possible for so adaptable a man. He may yet
form a Protectionist Ministry.
It appears there is really one man con-
nected with the Labour movement who emphati-
cally does not want to go into Parliament. Circus-
managers should keep an eye on this freak.
The other day a man told a meeting at
Queen Victoria’s Statue, Sydney, that the afore-
said statue would yet be melted down to make
spittoons for the Australian Republican House of
Representatives.
A certain N.S.W. Minister recently in-
formed a trained official that there was no vacancy
in his department. But he soon found room for
about eighteen untrained bushwhackers from his
own constituency.
A certain candidate for a seat in N.S.W.
Parliament goes carefully through the Sydney
newspapers'daily in search of libels upon himself,
and when he finds that his own pseudonymous
contributions or the libellous effusions of some
woman-friend of his are suppressed, be jaws
for hours about the want of “go” and “back-
bone ” of the various editors.
At the now-historical
“ commercials’ ” _ dinner,
N. S.W. Opposition-leader
Reid extravagantly lauded
Parkes, and said he was
ready to “ step down ”
should the ancient ever
again wish p take up the
running. Has he changed
his mind?
London Referee de-
fends the Lords with eh-
husiasm re their Home
Rule doings “ Only in
one respect are they weak.
There is one interest that
they do have in common
as a class—the land. They
are tainted with landlord-
ism.” As well say : “Only
in one respect are they
unhealthy they suffer
from leprosy.”
The absolute dullness
of the present N.S.W.
financial debate shows that
unless a fight for office is
going on there is no elec-
tricity in the air. Every-
thing in politics revolves
round loaves and fishes.
file MacMilliou com-
plains that B. R. Wise is
‘almost a Single-taxer.”
1 hat is what is the matter
with Wise : he is “ almost”
such a lot of things.
The Victorian Bill
restricting the importation
and sale of opium was
strongly opposed on the
ground that many respect-
able and old-established
Chinamen would fall down
dead if suddenly deprived
of their favourite drug.
Estimated that Fish, the rowdy Jabber-
wook of Maoriland Parliament, cost .£5730 last
session in stonewalling and motions for adjourn-
ment. leu solid days out of a short session con-
sisted solely of Fish.
The stoppage of free late night-trams has
practically abolished late sittings in N.S.W. As-
sembly. How far would a charge of tuppence a
game on dominoes, played on Parliamentary pre-
mises, conduce to preserving a quorum ?
Yic. Assembly’s reduction of the Gover-
nor’s salary from £lO,OOO to £7OOO was negatived
by the Council. The “ cutting to the bone ” of
one-third of the sewing-mistresses’ miserable £3O
per year renders unnecessary such a blow at “our
old nobility.”
Melb. Age on Parkes :—“ Earnest and
thoughtful men have lost confidence in a politician
who has uniformly used great national questions
for the promotion of his own private ends and has
uniformly betrayed the course he took up when
there was a chance of its succeeding.”
Thus Mr. Frank Hibernian O’Cotton,
M.P., on the N.S.W. financial debate :
Though I must say there seems a moat remarkable
divergence between the future lines of M'Millan and the
future policy of the present Colonial Treasurer, they are
apparently parallel lines which may possibly coalesce at no
very distant date.
Shades of Euclid and Todhunter !
Rev. R. Bavin, opening a Methodist
home for neglected children in Woolloomooloo,
last week, contended that the churches should not
surrender to the State the office of helping the
destitute. This is directly contrary to the views
of Bishop Montgomery, of Hobart, who holds
that the duty of helping the destitute falls wholly
on the State. Bavin’s theory is church charity—
Montgomery’s, State obligation.
Parkes’ ticket-meeting ‘at Melb. Town
Hall gave the reporters a chance to draw on their
imaginations. The Age said that the building
was about three-fourths full, the Argus described
the audience by the elastic term “large,” and the
hysterical Standard declared that “ the Town
Hill was crowded "with enthusiasts. In truth,
there might have been double as* many people
present, and the. old gentleman’s squeak fell flat.
Premier Dibbs exults in the golden har-
vest N.S.W. Treasury reaps from fines on con-
victed tote runners. The moral cowardice of the
politician seldom shows itself so conspicuously.
Why does not the Dibbs Govt, legalise the
totalisator ? Because such a measure would
alienate the sulphur and brimstone brigade?
Cash, which Dibbs fears to demand as a, regulating
and honesty-maintaining tax, he exults in grabbing
as a fine.
It is a pleasant reflection for Americans
that the Chinese cheap-labour leprosy was brought
upon them by “private-railway enterprise.’
The Central Pacific line was paid for by the white
American in State subsidies, and then the bowel-
less syndicate built it with imported yellow labour
so as to avoid paying white men’s wages. That
was many years ago, hut the curse of the Central
Pacific syndicate is with America till this day,
and every leper in the land is a monument to
private enterprise.
Four years ago Parkes repudiated the
assumption that a United Australia involved Pro-
tection against England, and one and all of his old
Cabinet colleagues took up that non-committal
fiscal attitude. Two years ago Parkes ridiculed
G. H. Reid for imagining that Federated Australia
would be other than unfederated N.S. Wales in its
relations with the outside world. His admission
in Melbourne last week that a United Australia is
not at present ripe for Freetrade with the outside
world gives away, consequently, the ground on to
which he enticed his colleagues and most of his
party.
IN THE SAME BOAT.
Wealthy LARRIKIN: “Don’t you often wish you wos a
man, Cissy ?”
Cissy : “Sometimes—don’t you ?”
A Marlborough (M.L.) lady elector de-
scribes herself as “spiritual adviser to my hus-
band.”
The Argus’ indictment of Lobengula is
delicious; he is accused of “cruelty, raiding,
plunder, slave-owning,” and of “ confiscating the
lives and property ot people belonging to weaker
tribes.” How beastly English the old savage
must he !
The application of Tennyson’s lines, “Are
there no hegarars at your gates, or any poor about
vour lands?’’ to the woman-suffrage question,
made in a S. M. Herald leader the other day, is
characteristically faulty. Lady Clara Vere de
Vere was thus reproached because she was spend-
ing her energies in pursuit of what harmed
another and merely amused herself, whereas
woman-suffragists ostensibly aim directly at giving
up what merely amuses them to labour for the ad-
vancement and worldly welfare of others. The
average woman-suffragist is the political and
social antithesis of the poet’s Lady Clara.
The Age on Federator Parkes :
We have found him in practice the narrowest of pro’
vincialists. . . Genius has its eccentricities. Rousseau
could philosophise by the mile, but he sent his children to
the foundling hospital.
The N.S.W. aboriginal reserves total
22,939 acres out of the 206,000,000 acres possessed
by the State. Among the heirs and holders of
this remnant of a vast territory, half-castes are to
full-blooded blacks as 3 to 2.
Col. Templeton, elected for Benalla (Vic.)
by the vote of the returning-officer, has been un-
seated on petition. The Bulletin is glad. No
man on earth has vim enough to simultaneously
attend properly to Parliament and to such a
colossal job as the Premier Permanent liquidation,
which has now been in hand four long years.
While N.S.W. Freetrade
camp consists of the present two
factions, G. H. Reid’s position
as leader is assured. Bruce
Smith M’Millan will have no
more of Parkes, and heartily
dislike Wise’s democratic lean-
ings ; on the other hand, Wise-
Parkes see that the hoped-for
support of the Labour-party
would be impossible with either
Bruce Smith or M'Millan at
the helm. In all the circum-
stances Reid is the only man
oily enough to keep down the
friction at the “ joint.”
Parkes’s atrabilious des-
cription of certain gad-aboub
Australian Governors has re-
ceived early illustration. The
case of Jean Ylark, sentenced
to death, was cohsidered and
reconsidered and finally decided
by the N.S.W. Cabinet, as the
new rules re death-sentences
require, and the decision would
have been communicated to the
man at once, but that it needed
to pass the Executive Council,
and the Council could not be
formed as Gov. Duff was holi-
daying at Broken Hill, and his
locum tenens, Chief Justioe Dar-
ley, had heard the case. Ylark
was surely entitled to know his
fate at once, but owing to Gov.
Duff’s “gadding-about” he was
for a week or ten days kept on
the grill.
Under the supposed chief-
tainship of G. H. Reid, N.S.W.
has developed five different

The Sydney police-court fine for deficient
weight in loaves of bread is ss. per oz. of the
deficiency. This is right enough where the
deficiency is proved to be the criminal act ot the
baker or seller, but why are police-courts thus
specially Draconic in the matter of bread ? Bread
is not as much a staple of life in Australia as m
the old lands of Europe. Why does not Aus-
tralian law impose ss. per oz. on deficiencies in
the weight of flesli-meat, and a similar sum tor
deficiencies in the measure of liquids? ihe
current practice merely shows how stereotyped
are governing instincts.

Sydney Jephcott, the Murray River (Vic.)
poet _ his handwriting no mortal man can

years a<ro in The Bulletin, has published
in London a volume of verses of which this paper
has not yet been able to get a copy. However,
should the book be up to the sain pie subj oined,
a future is in store for the man of hieroglyphics:
A great demand is springing up all over
Australia for the excellent brandy distilled in

Fact often copies fiction. The sad case of
the Tarella station-hand who, thrown from his
horse and having a limb broken, dragged himself
the other day into a hut, and, under the pressure
of thirst, shot himself with his mate’s gun, was
just about the plot of a storyette by a S. A. writer
published in The Bulletin some months ago.
WOMAN-SUFFRACE AND SCRIPTURE—A TIP

“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s goods !”
Last month the Lucania crossed the
Atlantic in 5 days 15 hours 37 min.—2o’s knots

Campania is, however, the faster of the two.
Ten shillings per hundred, W. Morison,
of Benalla, thinks quite enough to pay for shear-

THE LASH.
This bitter age ! when man and dog
Fight madly for the close-picked bone.
When Justice fashions laws to flog
The erring poor, and them alone.
KISSES.
What man would with counting cumber
The kisses required of love?
He surely might note and number
Wing-beats of a homing dove ;
Blind cliffs o’er the seas impended
Such reckonings may repeat,
The tale of the wavelets ended
That ever shall kiss their feet.
God giving us life, the tax He
Laid was the woe of man,
Ay, only the great galaxy
‘Of kisses his doom doth span ;
An infinite history burning
Up through the purple past;
An infinile promise yearning
Over our darkness vast.
Behold how each star e’er shivers,
Burning with deathless bliss!
Rapture, as deathlesf quivers
For e’er in man’s breathless kiss.
Then kiss me for ever seeing
’Tis the happiest use of breath,
And sightlessly stay our being
While waiting our turn of death—
And—Love, for my kisses living
Kiss me once more when dead 1 —
Ah ! Love this is lavish giving
Of sand, not of gems, I said.
There’s only one sun in heaven,
Only one earth in ours,
Only one life is given
Us and the birds and flowers ;
There’s only one sky to cover
Earth and the whole great sea—
And give me, O God, one lover,
She but one kiss to me.
One ! making the two souls lonely,
One, as the day is one,
Star and star shining, only
Lost in Love’s sovran sun !
So thought of that one kiss given
Would all existence immerse,
So turning to endless Heaven,
For me, all the Universe.
M’Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
Tub unfortunate dispute between the associated selling
brokers and the buyers has, we are pleased to say, been
amicably terminated. The terms of settlement are prac-
tically the same as we have been selling upon for some
time past, and we consider, for the sake of the trade, it is
to be regretted this arrangement was not agreed upon
some weeks back.
Wool.— We held our hsual auction sale to day, bringing
forward a fair-sized catalogue of greasy and scoured. The
attendance of buyers, both foreign and home, was very
large, and their desire to purchase was very apparent for
all classes, especially crossbred, and pieces, bellies and
locks being in strong demand, the market exhibiting a
very buoyant tone. For the well-known JJMoN brand
from Wagga, a well-skirted, nicely stapled wool, free from
burr and seed, biddings were slightly under owner’s idea
of value ; for the lambs 7d was obtained, (ijd for Ist pieces,
4£d for bellies, and bid for rams. MT/Bundy, 38 bales,
pieces sold at 5Jd, and the rams same figure. A Harrison/
Woodville, 9’bales unskirted sold at 6ld per lb., and CY/
Mudgee, 10 bales at 6Jd, and JOB, from Gilgandra, at 6d per
lb. For crossbred we obtained BJdfor2bales masked W/Gun-
ning, and 8 bales TS Dalston, from Murrungundi, fetched
7Jd per lb. Prices for scoured' also showed a firmer tone,
a further parcel of the'well-knovvn PR brand from Tumut
reaching 12d for Ist skin and 9|d per lb. for 2nd skin.
For a line of noted town scoured wool prices were hardly
up to our idea of value and it was passed in.
Hides.— At the sales to-day the market was firm at
prices quite equal to those ruling last week, best heavies
selling to 3Jd ; heavies, 2jd to 2|d per lb. ; light and
medium, l£d to IJd per lb.
Sheepskins.— Market firm for dry skins, but slightly
weaker for pelts and butchers’ green skins, best full-
woolled selling to 4|d ; superior, sd; medium, 3|d to
4Jd, and pelts 3d per lb; green skins, to 50d for large,
30d to 40d for medium, and 13d each for pelts.
Tallow. —The market declined 2s 6d to 5s per ton at
the sales to-day. Best mutton realised £23 5a ; best
mixed, £23 ; trade and brojeen parcels, to £2l per ton.
We offered 75 casks, including I. Tester, 21 casks ; Fooks,
8 casks ; L. 0. Hudson, 6 casks; AL Gearin, 14 casks; Y.,
6 casks.
Marsupial Skins. —Market for large grey, 40d to 52d ;
medium, 20d to 36d ; small, 2d to 18d ; large red, 18d to
24d ; small and medium, 2d to 17d ; wallaroo, to 18d;
wallaby, swamp, Jd'to 13d ; scrub, Jd to 14d ; rock, Jd to
3d each ; rabbit, from 3d to 7pi per lb. Opossum Skins:
Owing to the decline in London market, prices fell here
in sympathy. Greys, 7s 6d to 9s 6d for tops ; 4s 6d to 7s
for seconds ; and small and rumped, fid to 3s fid per
dozen ; black, from 9s to 16s per dozen.

SHOOTING THE BURGLAR—ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE.


Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will be one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
,£lO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,
who will be pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

Which reminds The Bulletin of another Aus-

manager for a leading solicitor at a salary of £8
per week. The banking crisis came along, and
his salary was reduced to £7. Then some other
crisis eventuated, and the firm proposed to reduce
him to £6. but he revolted and resigned his
situation. Thereupon his employers engaged an
equally competent manager at 80s. a week. The
second clerk was in receipt of £4 4s. per week,
but as it was obviously absurd that he should
receive three times the salary of his superior he
was sacked for the sake of preserving the
symmetry of the office, and his place was filled
by a relative of the firm, who gets no salary and
boards with the boss. The firm is now looking
for a youth who will pay ss. a week for the honour
of being office-boy, and then everything will be

One of the funniest things The Bulletin
has seen for a month. In a city street, the other

The knight simply nodded—apparently never
thought of returning the salute in kind.

There will shortly he, in one court or
other, an interesting matrimonial-case affecting an
Australian democratic politician. After the poli-
tician arrived in this country, his wife, who
remained in England, was told of his death, and
thereupon married again. The politician (who,
perhaps, had heard that his wife had died) also
married again. Her second husband died, and
she thereupon sailed for Australia—to find the
original husband very much alive and very much
married. Things would probably have been
hushed up had not the excited husband fallen out
with bis son by wife “number one ” on a delicate
question of legitimacy.

Thus a Maorilaud correspondent to The
Bulletin
At a recent bacheDrs’ ball at Arrowtown, Lake
C mntry, M.L., some ladies wore the regulation “ low-
neck,” and one sported the “ rational ” dress so ably ad-
vocated by Mrs. D. \V. M. Somebody, of Oamaru, and which

the lady in question adopted some time ago for ordinary
war. And very pretty the reformed dress was. Julgmg
by the furtive glances of the bachelors, it attracted their
attention much more than the low-neck dresses, owing,
perhaps as much to the shapeliness of the wearer's legs as
to the novelty of the dress. There is something about a
low neck that bends at least once every week over a wash-
tub however gracefully, that spoils the neck for purposes
of display. The neck never gets entirely over the wash-
tub curse. With the legs it is different. The manage-
ment of the legs in walking proclaims the lady. The neck
and head wriggle and wobble about as they like, the legs
and feet never. But then, in the reformed dress every-
thing depends upon the feet and the legs. A dreadful
bachelor friend of mine says that some ladies, ere adopt-
ing it, would have to reform their legs and feet. He also
tells me that the petticoat hides some horrible anatomical
mistakes. One thing is noteworthy, and that Is that our
ladies are a long way behind in the fashions. I have heard
the reformed dress, described by our ladies as the Bloomer
costume, the divided skirt, as knickerbockers, &c., all of
which shows that our ladies don’t read the papers, or
they would have known hotter. It remains to he seen
whether, now that they have a vote, politics will be a
stronger inducement than the fashions.

Sydney people have taken the present
smallpox visitation quite calmly, in marked con-
trast to their attitude during the epidemic of
some 10 or 12 years ago, when the public and the
authorities went stark mad with scare. It was a
common occurrence then for patients in a raging
fever to be flung aboard a hulk and towed in the
bitter cold of night or early morning—with a
separating length of 300 or 400 ft. of tow-rope
between the hulk and the steam-convoy—down
to the quarantine station. Now (unfortunately)
there is not even a vaccination agitation.

The other day, at Bagdad, Tas., a stately
old house, built 80 years ago, was undergoing
repair, wlien one of the workmen discovered em-
bedded in a wall the thigh-bone of a man. The
“oldest inhabitant” was called in, and he gave
the history of the house as banded down from
father to son. The bone was part of the helpless
cadaver of a “notorious bushranger” (name un-
known), who was captured by the original occu-
pant of the house—one Captain Espie—who built
it, in fact, with the proceeds of the State reward
granted him for the capture. Not content with
the mere enjoyment of his laurels, the “good old
English gentleman ” in his exultation procured
the ghastly “trophy” and had it built into the
wall, probably at the spot where his exalted head
would lie at night. Or, it may have been intended
to be talismanical, and placed there to keep evil
from a house got with the price of blood. If so,
it seems to have served the purpose well, for no
harm was known to befall the habitation while
its walls still contained the ghastly “charm.”
But so soon as it was discovered and taken away
the evil came, for a few nights afterwards (Oct. 21)
the old homestead was utterly consumed by fire,
the inmates barely escaping with their lives.

hands all round. Just then two medical students
staggered out, arm-in-arm, on to the staircase.
“Glorious thing to be alive !” hiccoughed Duclos.
“I’m not alive,” replied Staines; “ I’m a corpse,
stiff, deceased, non est.” “Gerrout, doesn’t your
blood circulate—don’t you feel, see, hear, and
talk?” urged Duclos. “No, I’m dead as a door
nail,” protested Staines. “ Oh, nonsense, old
fellow, you’re all right. Don’t be disheartened,
I’ll prove physiologically, psychologically, and
otherwise that you’re in the flesh.” “Yes,” said
Staines, as he felt his legs and arms, “ decomposi-
tion hasn’t set in, but I’m a cadaver.” With that
they embraced, took an eternal farewell, and —
rolled down-stairs.

Last week, in Sydney, an advt. appeared
for a respectable married couple to care for a baby
for three months—“ Terms, 15s. per week; no
baby-farmers need apply.” Before 10 a.m. the
registry-office whence the notice emanated was
surrounded by an excited crowd. Thin, scraggy
women fought with heavy-limbed, prolific-looking
matrons. Many had their husbands with them
(guarantee of respectability), and a number of
these were well-dressed—perhaps retrenched Civil
servants or bank-clerks. Two of the male baby-
hunters wore top-hats, and the generality of the
female applicants were by no means the style of
persons one sees hanging round registry-offices.
In all 54 applicants turned up before 11 a.ra.
Finally, the registry-man telephoned to the adver-
tising lady to come down herself, which she did.
Her choice was quickly made, and then the rest of
the crowd walked away, in stony and dejected
silence.

A Melb. correspondent to The Bulletin :
During a recent “flis’i-in-the-pan” Melb. theatre-
season, out of a programme roll-call of about 17 quite 11
names were those of amateurs. Every amateur club is
arranging a “ benefit ” for somebody. And as they take
the affair in hand for their own aggrandisement, and with
the very smallest concern for the result as far as the
beneflciare is implicated, they sometimes achieve sur-
prising effects. Quite lately an Amateur Association,
familiarly known as “ The Nostril Club,” undertook to
manoeuvre a benefit on behalf of a distressed gentleman
of their own circle. Having obtained an excellent advt.
out of the affair, which was all they wanted, the club
members took no further interest in the matter, did not
trouble themselves to push the sale of tickets, and, as a
climax, on the night of performance passed in close on a
hundred of their friends as dead heads ! Yet they spoke
of it afterwards as the “successful benefit” (?) which
they had given to Mr. .
The latest amateur development is of a very aggravating
sort. The heroine is a Miss Diana Bloustein, described in
the papers as “ a young lady well and favourably known
in Jewish circles.” She is to be tendered a “monster
be leSt on No/. 13th, when she will complete the incipient
downfall of the “ Lady of Lyons” by enacting Pauline.
There is no earthly reason apparent why Miss Bloustein
shoM fee tendered a benefit. The time is past when
benefits were only given to and accepted by people in
absolute need ; now there are, on an average, in Melb.
three amateur benefits a month to people in no way
necessitous. At such things the programme counts for
nothing, so when a legitimate benefit, not socially inflated,
comes for someone who thoroughly deserves help, it is
generally a failure.
Miss Bloustein, besides being an amateur actress, is also
an amateur painter. For years her works have accumu-
lated, and now two tons of oil-paintings, more or less,
are to be given away as “ Bloustein trophies.” The
list is in every shop-window. “The highest scorer in the
season’s cricket,” the winning jockey in the Melbourne
Cup, the most popnlir man in Victoria (I), the most
popular lady (whew ! !)—each is to be presented with a
Bloustein trophy. Verily, there is only one thing worse
than an amateur, and that is two amateurs.

a substitute being meanwhile provided at a miser-
able pittance. Daring the measles epidemic the
latter was taken ill, and for one solitary Sabbath
was unable to preach ; whereupon, it is averred,
the Church-committee promptly docked him of a
week’s salary ! Surely this can’t be true?
Chief Justice
Darley, at Broken

the practice fre-

they are fallen

not follow (was
the gist of his
Honor’s argu-
ment) that the
prostitute is neces-
sarily a liar. On
the other hand,
though, it by no
means follows that

The horrors of the Health Board’s report
on N.S.W. slaughterhouses should send down by
80 per cent, the price of most country-killed pork :
With very few exceptions, slaughtering establishments
are in a deplorable condition from utter disregard of .
regular and effective cleansing. . . . The i mer walls
of killing-houses are plastered with fat and blood, the
accumulation of long periods ; the floors are broke i and
under-run with decomposed and highly-offrnsivesoakage;
in corners and on the rafters overhead are heads and feet,
in many cases in advanced decomposition, and it is no
uncommon occurrence for maggots to drop on to you
when walking under them ; the baulks on which carcases
hang are rarely cleansed from the first time they come
into use; and the same remrrk is applicable to
the saws, knives, cleavers, and other implements
used in the trade, and to the men’s clothes, cloths
used in dressing, covering carcases in carts, &0.,
The water used for dressing purposes is often very im-
pure. Such is the condition of the inside of slaughter-
houses. . . . The surroundings are equally revok-
ing. . . . The blood and swillage generally runs on to
the ground surface or into a trough which overflows in
the piggery adjoining, and the result is that the pigs are
often wallowing in a black, foul smelling slush up to their
bellies. . . . Quantities of uncooked offal are fre-
quently thrown to the pigs, who drag it about and leave
it to fester in all sorts of hoi'S and corners. The pigs are
oftentimes shut up in the yards, but in several instances I
found them in the slaughterhouse tugging away at the
neck of a carcase that » as hanging to cool.
After this, one can nearly understand the feel-

she has never been permitted to too closely observe

Warrnamhool Town Council the other day
opened tenders for the supply of horses, drays, and
drivers for the year. There were six offers, all out-
rageously low. The lowest was P. Carmody,
4s. 4£d. ; next, J. Tinker, ss. 5d.; two others were
ss. 7d. and ss. lid. A dray and horse, with a
man—to work under the eye of a martinet over-
seer—for 4s. per day ! If the Town Council
has no regard for human-flesh, it might, in so
sporting a district, at least have a little for horse-
flesh. The same corporation has in its employ, in
a clerical capacity, a man of about 30 years, at the
weekly salary of 10s. !

N.S.W. Sheriff Cowper has shown, re the
howl raised in Press and Parliament (apparently
at the instance of the police), that no undue
favour was shown to the murderer Glasson by
allowing him to dine with his wife during his trial.
The point at issue, however, was not the undue-
ness but the unusualness of the favour. The
Bulletin, having itself been in Cowperian custody,
is prepared to believe that the Sheriff always tries
to behave nicely to everybody. To be in the
official hands of Mr. Charles Cowper is as pleasant
as interviewing the Chesterfieldian Police-Chief
Fosbery or being arrested by Detective Rochaix —
“the most gentlemanly and considerate man ever
met,” according to a certain magnate to whose
house the Frenchman went with a warrant a few
months ago.

There is going to be a curse of Glasson, as
well as a curse of Deeming. Already the Glasson
anathema has caused two deaths and one violent
maniac, and it is only getting properly oiled and
in good running order. First of all, a bank-
manager, who had read the case until the blood
and gruesomeness of it was as a weight on his
brain, arose in the dead of night and shot a
young lady whom he mistook for a burglar. Then
a Oarcoar man pored over the butchery till his
mind—which probably wasn’t very numerous at
any time—gave way, and he is now a raging
maniac who fancies that he is going to be
executed. Next, Sheriff Cowper got into
trouble for “ undue lenience ” towards the
prisoner. After that, a Sydney Grammar School
boy read up the horror until he became filled with
a desire to know what hanging was like, and died
in the search for information. He hung himself
in a naked condition in a bath-room, using the
bath-towel for a rope, but, having kicked over the
chair which served as a scaffold, he was unable to
climb down again, and perished just when he had
learned all he wanted about the subject. Also,
the original shares of the City Bank have dropped
ss. or so since the murder.

The fat lady “friend” of a certain notable
Southerner held an animated discussion with him
in the train (suburban line) a few nights ago.
They were alone together in their particular com-
partment, and forgot, or didn’t trouble to re-
member, that the carriage contained three other
stalls, where admiring auditors held their breath
and chuckled internally. “Money” was the en-
thralling topic of debate. The lady pleaded heavy
bills to meet, and appeared to emphasize an
opinion that her protector was spending too much
cash “at home” by thumping his influential bat
with a parasol. For a time they talked without
reducing the point at issue to figures, so the
people in the hind compartment couldn’t say for
certain whether the irate female was being pro-
perly subsidised, or treated in a niggardly spirit.
This problem was solved, however, when the
notable personage roared forth, “ What! yer can’t
keep ’ouse on £6O a month ! ’Ow much more
d’yer want, Mariar?” Fifteen golden sovereigns

A fluent and clever writer, who is also an
experienced newspaper reporter, was recently
blackballed at the precious Melbourne Institute
of Journalists. In the estimation of an editor,
the rejected man would take precedence of nine-
tenths of the Institute, and the Institute was
specially constructed to shut out undesirable
persons of that class. They are “pilled” reli-
giously, it seems, unless they happen to be
“engaged in regular work” for any of the great
rags, an excuse which reduces the term journalist
to an absurdity. A fitting design for those dis-
tinguishing badges (bestowed upon members of
the Institute by themselves) would be the figure of
Mediocrity—rampant.

Nearly every week now the N.S.W. In-

Kane municipal body or public magnate, praying
for the promotion of Constable A or B on account
ot some cited deed of alleged heroism. To the
Inspector-General it has begun to appear that the
public are really astonished to find a policeman
doing active duty of any sort, and so far from
these claims for special recognition making him
proud of his men they act in a contrary fashion.
Sometimes the claim is absolutely preposterous,
as in the case of a J.P. who requested the promo-
tion of an officer who had found his “ valuable

Dear Bulletin,
—My derogatory re-
marks re the Austra-
lian mirage seem to
have aroused the
wrath of several of
your readers. Let me
assure “B.” that I
know as much of the
Q. plains as most
men ; also, I have
been across theborder
into the Northern
Territory, and in
South and Western
Australia, so that I
have made the ac-
quaintance of the
mirage under many
more conditions than
probably he has, and
have never yet been
fool enough to start
after one, whether my
tongue was hanging
out or not. The most
realistic one I ever
saw was in the N.
Territory of S.A. It
was a very pretty
thing in its way, and
1 drew the black boy’s
attention to it. His
reply, in the language
of the educated and
civilised nigger, was:
“S’posin’ new-
chum here, he think
it water.” With all
due deference to Mr.
“B.” and “Tom Co-
llins,” I decline to
retract my assertion
as to the character of
the mirage, nor have
I much faith in
“B.’s” “old stock-
men” or the “many
poor wretches who
have perished by fol-
lowing a mirage.”
There may, in thirst-
lunacy, be delusive
mirages of the brain;
but I have yet to see
the mirage which will deceive a sanebushman.—D.

That Austral Salon young lady who ex-
poses her genius to ordinary theatrical criticism
threatens to become a serious nuisance. Nothing
leas than a pound of treacle for her perfoimance
will satisfy female literature, and the journal that
calls her “moderate” is bombarded with pink-
coloured protests from truculent virgins of the
salon. The girls ought to be satisfied with their
own special privilege of administering adjectives
to the amateur Bernhardt in their own little
“organs,” but they are not. However, the time
must surely come when the mutual-admiration
society will “ fall out ” over something—a man,
probably. Then will the pink-tinted letter-
writers of to-day take the nasty, rough notice to
their meagre bosoms, and scramble for a chance to
squeeze the hand that did the deed.

At the annual meeting of Vie. Animals’
Protection Society, Mrs. H. A. Dugdale tried to
move that Gov, Hopetoun should be expostulated
with re the use of the bearing-rein on his horses.
Chairman Wrixon ruled the lady “ out of order, ’
and energetically declared that to censure the
Gov. would be “unwise, injudicious, too personal,
do more harm than good,” &c. The lady replied
that had the chairman let her proceed it would
have been seen she had no desire to either censure
or punish, but simply to give the Gov. informa-
tion of which he seemed ignorant. The Wrixon
then said there was no cruelty in bearing-reins, and
called upon a vet. present to confirm his state-
ment. “ But our Society calls it the ‘ Cruelty-
Reinl’ ” exclaimed Mrs. Dugdale. To no purpose,
except a promise from the chairman that he would
take the resolution for private consideration.
After the meeting, some members thought it
advisable to invite opinions from other vets. by
letter in a daily. Said letter was sent next day;
it had not appeared at time of writing.
{Copy of Letter to Argus.)
THE CRUELTY-REIN.
Sir. —The Victorian Society for the_ Protection of
Animals, having re-named the bearing-rein by the more
appropriate one of "The Cruelty-rein,” it was astounding
to hear a vet., at the annual meeting of the Society,
assert that the rein is not injurious and “only gives a
good carriage to the horse." It sounded akin to that
other barbarous notion which calls the human body "a
good figure,” after having been squeezed into an ungrace-
ful form by corsets. The idea of a powerful restraint
upon free movements of head, neck, and throat of the
unfortunate horse not being “injurious” is so opposed
to reason—to say nothing of humanity—that it would be
interesting and instructive to have the opinions of other
veterinary authority ; because there are always thought-
less persons who follow- any fashion, originating in high
places, mattering nothing how unnatural or detrimental
such fashion may be.
I am, sir, Yours, &c.,
H. A. Dugdale.

Ever at warring in her wilderness.

Come but as gleaner after gathered sheave*
Taken by others, a wild flower like thee ;
Letting its pearly petals gently ope,
Ever revealing to the bird and bee,
Infinite sweetness hidden in the leaves.

In Maoriland, the veterans of the war, or
their widows, get a sixty-acre grant from the
State, and even now some very old soldier occa-
sionally turns up to claim his little allotment.
The latest claimant is a lady, who wants 180 acres
as the widow of three successive veterans, and the
Govt, is considering her case very hard. All her
husbands were soldiers of the 28th Regiment, and,
according to law, they should have settled down
in the country after the war, which they didn’t do
in any legal sense. But their widow settled in
the country three separate times on their account,
and, so far as can be judged at present, the State
will have to pay up.

Editor Bulletin, —In last issue of your paper
you state that “ you are not in a position to absolutely
guarantee the bona fides of any of the numerous land
lotteries now advertised." On behalf of the Equitable
Society of Brisbane, may I ask you to insert the following
few words in defence of its bona fides : “ The Equitable
is a duly incorporated society, registered under the
Queensland Building Societies Act of 1886, which requires
that before registration of a society its proposed rules
shall be submitted to the certifying barrister under the
Act. The legality of the Equitable Society has not
so far been questioned, and we would point out
that onr advertisements are not notices of a lot-
ery at all. They invite applicants to take shares
In a building society legally constituted. The sub-
scriber does not apply for nor receive a ticket in a
lottery, but a share certificate in a building society with a
limited liability. The fact that he may obtain a consider-
able benefit which is not shared by other members is only
an incident of hi* membership.—Yours, &c., Pierce and
Cos., 126 Pitt-street, Sydney.” [The Equitable, as our
correspondent states, is not 'a lottery, therefore The
Bulletin’s remarks didn’t and oouldn’t possibly apply to
it.—Ed. B.]

Less than 40 years ago Sydney sent many a
well-equipped whaler "hump-backing" and “sperming”
in the Pacific. In those days the whaling grounds—from
the Kermadecs to the icy shores of Alaska, and from Tal-
cahuana to the Moluccas—were lively with a vast fleet of
Ships, the nightly glare of whose try-works lit up the
darkness of the ocean.
But the Yankees had the biggest share in the
business. From New Bedford alone came 700 ships, and
New Haven, Salem, Martha’s Vineyard and other ports
sent as many more. The work went merrily on till, in
about 1860, the right whales, harried in both oceans, went
away to security among the ice, and the sperm w'hales,
hunted all over the warmer seas, were almost exter-
minated. Then a host of ships left the Pacific field, and
the port of Honolulu, that once saw 470 ships rendezvous
there in one month, became almost deserted, save for some
90 or so vessels that stuck to the Pacific.
Then came the war. Semmes in the Alabama
and Wardell in the Shenandoah glutted themselves with
burning and sinking whaleships, and at the end of the
rebellion whaling was almost wiped-out, and has continued
so ever since—save as regards the Arctic steam w'halers of
Dundee and Peterhead. Still even so late as 1872 the
writer has seen 62 whaleships in less than six weeks cruis-
ing between Pleasant Island and Guam (Ladrone Islands).
Many of these were sperm-whalers only, the others only
spermingpro tem., ere going on to the northern right whale
grounds off the coasts of Japan and Siberia. Of all these,
there were but five flying the British ensign—two from
Sydney and three from Hobart. And yet 10 years before
30 or 40 were annually fitted out in Sydney.

nental money.
Hard-ground miners are offered tributes on
Glen Elgin mine, Glen Innes, N.S.W. Those already there
are making fair wages, and the manager says he has room
for 30 more. 2s. a ton only is charged for crushing
which is done by water-power, and the lode is opened up
by tunnels and shafts for over 2000 ft. in length.

Says a Melbourne paper, re Mr. Wynne’s
bill for infusing a little honesty into the dealings'©! Vic-
torian joint stock companies; “It is doubtful whether
there are more than half a-dozen members of Parliament
competent to discuss the subject of company legislation.
Tncre are 16 Acts of the Imperial Parliament in force
relating to public companies, besides isolated sections in
other Acts, Board of Trade regulations, and 4000 decisions
by the Courts, all of which should be studied before
venturing on fresh legislation." Great Scott, yes ! And
there are about a billion cases on record where a drunk
was fined 55., and they all need to be looked up and care-
fulh studied before anew Licensing Bill is drafted. That
is the great trouble about Australian legislators—they
don’t read up a subject with sufficient care.

Good wine needs no bush, nor a good mine any
newspaper-booming. Shepherd’s alluvial mine, Adelong
district, N.S.W., quietly keeps its own in affluence
though the public never hear a word about its yields.
The work is largely done by water-power, and it goes on
year after year to the enrichment of its lucky bachelor
owner—who has gone to Chicago.

There is an enormous carbonate-of-soda deposit
a few miles out of Cooma, N.S.W., the water from which
will burst the strongest glass bottle made. If it but con-
tained 30 per cent, alcohol it would be a bigger pile than
Mt. Morgan.

For a loan of .£lO an Auckland (M.L.) Shylook
made a woman pay £63 10s. To raise the money the vic-
tim left the path of honesty and started shop-lifting.
Caught and punished, the money-lender gels off scot free.

In a letter to the Age, A. J. Perks complains
that it is like pushing a stone uphill to get anew gold-
saving invention acknowledged as an improvement. Little
wonder; gold being the world’s god there are as many
new gold-saving processes as there are new religions. But
Mr. Perks makes out a good case in favour of more
minutely testing his own inventions for recovering fine
gold from tailings.

As the Murchison (W.A.) G.F. Jockey Club

Cecil Rhodes (virtual ruler of South Africa)
once took a lot of diamonds to England for sale. Barnato
Bros, made a wholesale offer. Rhodes considered and
said, “I’ll let you have them on one condition, that is
that you let me see what no eye, human or divine, ever
saw before.” “ What’s that “ Why, 220,000 carats of
diamonds sold, mixed up in one bucket." “Done.”
The diamonds were poured into a bucket, the sight
photographed, and eyes feasted. It took Barnato Bros,
six weeks to re-sort and classify, during which time
Rhodes had the diamond-market all to himself.

Broadly speaking, there are but two classes of
business men in Melbourne just now-rogues and
“cranks.” The person who is not actively dishonest, or
in passive sympathy with dishonesty, must be a “crank”
so they say.
Glaason, the Carcoar murderer, having
been medically declared sane, is to be hanged.
“Give us this day our daily bread.”—
Melbourne journalists, to Pastor Fitchett.
The cable : “ Capt. Williams, of the
British forces, is missing, and it is believed he has
been murdered by the Matabele.” Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of the Matabele have also been
murdered by Captain Williams’ gang, but that, of
course, comes under the heading of “ Great
British victory.”
Searle and Sons, of Sydney, are showing
specimens of Tacsonia Millissima —a fruit new to
Australia. The plant, which can be seen in pro-
fusion in Lima, Peru, is a very handsome climber,
specially adapted for trellis-work, and will grow
wherever the common passion-fruit grows. It
bears a lovely pink blossom and foliage of a pretty
green. The fruit hangs in clusters, is very prolific,
and makes a delicious preserve.
According to a cable, which read at first
like a humorous nightmare, but which seems to be
developing into a reality, Sells Bros., the Yankee
circus people, have seized all the N.S.W. mineral
exhibits at Chicago as security for damages in an
action which they profess to be bringing against
the Cornstalk Govt. The case relates to their
ancient grievance re the quarantining of their
horses at Sydney. Apparently, the two comic
Americans intend to run their action at Chicago,
and expect the Dibbs Ministry to go over
there to defend it; meanwhile, the clown has
seized the exhibits as security for payment of the
verdict which the firm thinks it is going to get
later on. Under these circumstances, it is diffi-
cult to see how N.S.W. is going to get adequate
redress. It might, of course, declare war against
the U.S., and borrow that 100 Bendigo militiamen
for the occasion, and send them over to seize San
Francisco; or it might bring an action against the
President in the small-debts Court at Dubbo, and
then hypothecate the Consul’s wardrobe as
security, but there is very little satisfaction either
way.
Messrs. G. H. Smith & Son, hatters, of
302 George-street, Sydney, announce that they
have been appointed sole agents for Henry Heath,
the famous London maker, extensively patronised
by royalty. Messrs. Smith’s premises are exten-
sive, centrally situated, and furnished with every
variety of hat that the head of man can desire.
The newest styles of straw hats—the only kind
adapted to an Australian summer—are to be found
there in immense variety; also Panama hats, pith
hats, cork hats, felt hats, and the sombre bell-
topper of respectability in all degrees of curliness
of brim. The Bulletin is privately of opinion
that hats should be abolished as a curse and the prin-
cipal cause of baldness, but while they remain with
us no one can do better than buy his curse from
G. H. Smith & Son, where the unavoidable evil
is always well-made, and of excellent quality.
The newly-arrived visitor to Sydney can
find coolness and comfort at the Wentworth Hotel,
situated in the best and breeziest part of the city
—Church Hill, within a few minutes of the Post
Office. In this luxurious hotel, which is under
the personal supervision of the proprietress, Mrs.
Hayes, there are 70 rooms, luxuriously furnished
and fitted with all modern appliances and inven-
tions for ensuring comfort. Some idea of the
air space in the Wentworth can be obtained
when it is mentioned that instead of the “horse-
box ” style of rooms not infrequently met
with in some of the leading hostelries, many of
those in this excellently-designed building are 20
feet by 20 ! Families in search of private suites
will find those at the Wentworth unrivalled. The
cuisine is unsurpassed in Sydney, and the name
of the hostess is a sufficient guarantee that visitors
receive every attention and civility. And in these
black times of financial depression, it may be well
to add that the terms of the pleasant Wentworth
are such as could be cavilled at by none but a mis-
anthrope.*
The V.R.C. Derby-Day Costumes.
Lady Clarke— who had Major-General and
Mrs. Hutton in her party was, writes
“Sappho ” from Melbourne, undoubtedly the most
richly-dressed Derby-goer. Her expensiveness
consisted of a pale-grey Duchesse, with a basket
pattern in pale-yellow and faint blue. The skirt
was a “granny,” with a border of pale-blue and a
festoon of straw-coloured ribbon; the bodice was
made with a three-frill basque edged with harle-
quin balls, a blue ribbon belt and a frilled front
of straw-coloured chiffon the tiny bonnet
exactly harmonising. Belle-like Mrs. Rupert
Clarke was Erin-go-Bragh-ish in emerald green,
fussily and fashionably trimmed with frills,
edged with white lace —rustic hat. Somebody I
didn’t recognise wore a very taking frock of fine
white muslininsertion, with fretful flounces, higher
than the knees, of white tarletan, cape bodice
trimming of similar frills, and a white hat heavily
trimmed with yellow roses. Mrs. Balls-Headley
suggested a Lethbridge pas seul, in black accor-
deon pleats, which are coming in to fashion, by
the way. One very elaborate form—pale-blue
satin with a jupon of white silk lined in pale-blue
and trimmings everywhere of fine white lace-
made me think of “ Advance Australia.”
Some of the black gowns turned out very well.
Mrs. (Majoress) Rennie, in black crepon threaded
in black satin, the bodice satin covered with
black net, looked stylish ; Mrs, Harry Rennie was
in black with a pompadour spot, empire sleeves of
green moir6 and trimmings of black lace; Miss
Ethel Pilcher wore shades of violet; the Misses
Williamson (Darling Point) were workmanlike
in fawn and blue, with clever touches of black.
A pretty girl from the same classic neighbour-
hood also wore fawn —unwisely—and spoilt her-
self, although, judging by the way a suc-
cessful Coolgardie speculator, with a red
buttonhole the size of a bun, toted her
about all day everybody didn’t think so. Miss
Ina Hogg wore a well-built tweed, with a habit-
shirt ; Miss Mary Cholmondeley’s dark-blue serge
was a wax-fit—a relief to the eye, as most of the
gowns were built on the baggy principle; Mrs.
Walter Hall was also tailor-made, with a gilt-lace
bonnet, an incongruous flower on it. Tailor-made
women shouldn’t wear artificials —it is their duty
to be altogether mannish. A flower nodding
about a sternly-cut garment strikes one as being
almost as out of place as a wreath of roses round a
bell topper.
After all, it is the spirit a woman dresses in that
ensures a successful ensemble ; to wear an ultra-
stylish garment requires more pluck than the
under-dressed imagine. lam quite positive, for
instance, that Ascot gave birth to the festive gown
a recently-travelled Melbourne doctor’s wife wore
with a troubled expression. How her Piccadilly
prinkings weighed on her nerves was quite evident
from the fact that she clung to a long mantle, into
which she retired like a periwinkle into
its shell when the extremeness of her
modishness came home to her in some
especially sunny corner. I was amused, too, at
the get-up of a Maoriland bride, in shot-green and
lobster, with a parasol hideously en suite. She
hadn’t enough aplomb to carry off her mayonnaise-
like toilet, and I could almost fancy how she
longed for one of those “ while-you-wait ” linen
skirts and jackets that are as out-of-step with
fashion on a racecourse as flour-bags belted with
string would be. Yet they were numerous
at Flemington. Also, a lady who has been
litigating recently for a few plums out
of somebody’s will spent some of her gains
in a bull’s-eye striped silk, cut short to reveal
No. 2 feet; and another damsel, who is tabooed
in Toorak on account of a fancy-ball costume that
left little to the imagination at the pedestal end,
was evidently trying to create a good impression
in sad brown serge. I didn’t remark any startling
Spring fancies for men. Button holers seem to have
expanded, and overcoats are all out horsey. By
the way, I saw L. L. Smith standing on a lawn
seat with a butterfly-bow necktie protruding over
his weskit! This is one civilising touch of the
trip ’Ome.
The vice-regal party arrived before the first race
in three (or four, I forget) open carriages, to the
serviceable tune of the Anathema. I was a good
deal surprised to see that Admiral Bowden-Smith
(with a bold red bunch in his coat) was given the
pas of Sir Robert Duff (who hadn’t Lady Duff
with him). Going away, too, the Admiral took
precedence ! Even Lord Charles Scott wasn’t
“stroke oar” to those lengths!—and to see the
Admiral trotting off two carriages ahead of the
N.S.W. Governor seemed to 1 place the latter
in a very bony social light. There wasn’t
much Solomonish glory displayed by the vice-
regal women. Lady Hopetoun re-psgduced the
really tasty frock she adorned Randfvick in,
but the cerise satin bonnet-strings were new. Mrs.
Bowden-Smith (who has a very fair notion of
smart but matronly dressing) wore black grenadine
over bottle-green satin which came to the surface
here and there in puffs and folds—gold galon
bonnet with gold aigrette; Miss Bowden-Smith
was plainly dressed in brown contrasted with
black guipure and a black hat; Lady Glasgow
presented a mottled appearance, and Lady
Augusta Boyle was in white; Miss Grace Nor-
man looked cool in heliotrope and white—
but the Governor’s box dressing was the usual
half-hearted sort of thing if you judged it
purely from an “as now worn ” point of view.
Lady Hopetoun put the blue silver-fringed Derby
(“ Give us abitto remember by !” said half-a-dozen
voices) round the neck of the winner—or, rather,
Carnage stuck his nose through the loose loop
himself as if he fancied his collar. By the way,
what odd colours Mr. Wilson’s are—all white
with a red cap ! They make the jockey look like
a bottle with a sealing-waxed cork.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Derby Day at Flemington was a success of the
strictly moderate order. If the crowd seemed
very as compared with the mobs of the
1886-90 period well, what did the club expect?
Times have shrunk even more perceptibly than
Derby attendances, and, all things considered, Flemington
holds its own. The Stand seating-accommodation was
“ taxed to its uttermost extent " long before the race of
the day had arrived ; there were a good many head of
punting cattle on the Hill, but the slopes in front ‘of the
Stand had not been as sparsely populated for several
years. Also, the modest amount of ticket fragments
scattered about the bookmakers’ paddock told that the
proportion of visitors who didn’t bet was abnormally
large. A vast falling-off in the drink trade could be
partially accounted for by the vast reduction in the size of
the drinking vessels, and the consequent determination of
the multitude to spite the caterer by remaining sobet. A
general retrenchment policy is opposed to paying sixpence
for athimblefull of beer.
* • *
The result of the Derby fetched a real burst of
enthusiasm, especially from the people who had backed
Carnage many weeks ago, straight-out and in “ doubles.”
Others were honestly glad to see the race taken by ahorse
so closely related to their beloved Carbine and so sugges-
sive of the old champion in appearance. Here was the
“another Carbine ” that they had been waiting to idolise,
one good enough to win the Derby, and win it hand-
somely, notwithstanding a lack of condition. That Car-
nage wanted more gallops to make him as good as he
could have been made, seemed apparent after the race,
when, by the way, he walked a trifle lamely. Whether
the colt was much, or little, or not at all short of work a
matter beyond the ken of anyone outside the stable circle
—the Cup race has decided ere now. Anyway, he was the
noble animal that, at his very best, should have repeated
the Martini-Henry performance. May he go on and pros-
per and always be raced to win in accordance with Car-
bine traditions ! Carnage is half-brother on the dam’s
side, and nephew by paternity, to Donald Wallace’s great
champion. The sporting papers call him an “ own
brother in blood,” a term with more sound than sen&
in it.

That Carnage did get a good deal behind in his
training work was taken for a fact, otherwise
there would now be unkind things said about his
moderate show in the Caulfield Guineas.
* * *
The Melbourne Stakes running, which used in
days of yore to be a reliable guide to the Cup result,
pointed to the chances of Oxide, Sainfoin, and Swiveller,
who beat Newman and Jeweller in the Caulfield handicap.
Newman, meeting Loyalty on their Melb. Cup difference
in weight, ran the Maoriland youngster very close, and
on that collateral form Oxide was expected to hold
Loyalty safe on Tuesday.

Penance found a few unreflecting backers for
the Hotham Handicap, on the off-chance that he might
be good enough to get home in moderate company. Yet
it was only reasonable to suppose that they wouldn’t
scratch Penance for the Cup if his leg allowed him to be
“ wound up ’’ far enough to win over a 13 furlongs course
three days previous to the great race. He has a very
shaky foreleg.
» * •
Dreamland, with artist Teddy Power “up,” won
the Maribyrnong Plate rather easily at the finish. Not as
commandirg a colt as Miorite, Merridong and others in
the race, D. eam'and is one of the pretty youngsters that
soon learn to fly. By Trenton, out of Mentor’s dam, this
“ good thing ” from Ballarat should do great things. But
Trenton, unfortunately, seems to transmit his infirmities,
and his stock don’t last long on the turf.
* ■* ♦
Rosebrook, ridden by Hales, won the Coburg
Stakes last Saturday—a startling improvement on the
mare’s “ form ” in the Mentone Handicap only 24 hours
previously. Perhaps Hales represented a lot of the
difference in the two performances. Capable horseman-
ship went for much on Derby Day, when Moore, Gough,
M‘Gowan, Power and Hales won 5J out of the six events.
* * *
Lady Hopetoun’s slipping of the Blue Riband
on Carnage’s neck was a somewhat spasmodic effort. Her
Excellency had not attired herself with a view to emergen-
cies, and her movements required more scope, so to speak.
The biscuit costume appeared to strain at the waist, her
high-cut collar was a trifle tight at the neck, and the
coral pink bonnet-strings gripped her under the chin in a
style that suggested face-ache. It was an uncomfortable
get-up altogether, but her ladyship managed to do the
trick at one fell swoop, to the huge delight of sassiety.
Carnage, hemmed in by a demonstrative mob (on the
slope in front of the vice-regal box), was kind enough not
to kipk, otherwise there might have been a distinguished
funeral or two, in honour of the event.
# * #
The Melb. Cup of 1893 is too painful a subject
for discussion. All the expensive favourites were prac-
tically nowhere, and Tarcoola, a 100 to chance, was the
winner. Carnage, a 10 to 1 animal, came in second, and
Jeweller (100 to 4) third. Not one tipster, so far
as The Bulletin is aware, gave the winner, or
even thought of giving him—in fact, it seems about
time that the tipping business were altogether
abandoned. Hardly anybody backed the winner. It
was conclusively proved on “ form ” and on a number of
other things that he couldn’t get anywhere near the front
rank, and it remains that way still. The bookmakers
unanimously hove their hats in the air when the result was
announced, and didn’t care, in their exuberance, whether
they ever came down again. As for the general public,
it hasn’t the price of a tram-fare home, and there is much
gnashing of expensive shop teeth over money that has
gone to make champagne flow in Canaan.
* * •
“Demos” : This Melb. Cup is the scab of the
Austral continent. Here is a wretched, poverty-stricken
population, sinking deeper and deeper into the mire of
pauperism, and yet it goes off its head with a mere news-
paper-flogged-up carnival of gambling. Why should a
nation be thus excited over two-score horses running a
bat ? They are mostly owned by consummate scoundrels.
The system is so honeycombed with trickery and villainy
that the winning riders of most of the greatest events in
Victoria for a year past are under disqualification. This
race helps signally to make Australia stink in the world’s
nostrils. It typifies an atrocious spendthrift—a fellow
hung with the chains of debt —and yet he goes on a pro-
digious burst.

Blackwood used to donate.

Dear Bulletin,— The new V.R.O. idea of giving
the handicapper power to readjust the weights of horses,
in cases that were formerly met by a fixed penalty for
winning, may work just about as well, or ill, as the old
plan. Sainfoin incurred nothing extra by his Caulfield
Cup performance, inasmuch as he didn’t fairly beat Tim
Swiveller, whereas, a year ago, we should have witnessed
the farce of actually second horse having to meet his
conqueror at a disadvantage of 141bs. for the big race.
On the other hand, Oxide and all the other competitors
were denied a 141bs. chance of beating one of the pair
that finished in front at Caulfield.—Yours, Doubtful.
• » •
Sternchaser was about the hardest-handicapped
horse in the Cup. The same age as Portsea, he was
asked to meet the little fellow on 71bs. worse terms than
in the Australian Cup, where Portsea just beat him.
# • *
W. T. Jones, in England, was cabled for to
oome back in time to see his horse, Penance, win the
Melbourne Cup. But Penance went gradually wrong on
a favourite leg, and after giving the horse a test gallop
on the Tuesday before the race, Forrester signed his
death-warrant for the Cup. Thus the three placed horses
of last year— Glenloth, Honda, and Penance —were all
marked out of it this time.
* • *
Dear Bulletin,—ln your sporting column you
refer to the Govt, billets obtained by prominent N.S.W.
cricketers. This reminds me that that best of cricketers
and decentest of men generally—Ted Evans—is now
walking about unemployed, having been deprived
of his situation in the Lands Department. Ted is
up in years now, and has sons playing good cricket, but
his own cricket is still O.K. If cricket has done_ anything
for N.S.W., and most people think it has, it is a great
pity that such a man as Evans should be neglected, while
others who never approached him either as cricketer or
as a man should be so well provided for by a paternal
Government.—Yours, Muff.

As you have learned by cable, says The Bullb*
tin’s London correspondent, Sullivan beat Bubear very
easily against the voice of the prophets. Even Billy
Innes was wrong. Of course; there are the head-
shakings and hints that Bubear wasn’t “on the job.” My
own opinion is that the long Maorilander won on his
merits. Bubear is done with. No man could lead the
life he does and be anything.

A boxing-match has been arranged between Harry
Laing (M..L.) and the apparently ‘‘soft ” Mick Dooley, of
Sydney. This should be an easy thing for Dooley, who,
however, is a most unreliable man in the ring. With bare
knuckles on the grass, Mick has proved himself a man of
pluck, but the boards, the footlights, and the gallery in a
glove-contest, make him as nervous as a stage novice.

Mr. Gollan, Maoriland racehorse-owner and

7.000. as unsuitable for cultivation, there are

ing 640 acres to each settler, 18,750 fanners might

Australia display as little interest as they hereto-

Mosquitoes up North are of immense size
this year. A gold-fossloker trying his luck by a
creek, found it impossible to work. Nettingsaved
his face, but his felt-hat offered no more resistance
than would a piece of gauze. In desperation he
flung the hat aside and put the tin dish on his
head. The steel-like stings oame through all the
same, and out of revenge he clinched them. Then
the “ skeeters ” soared away with the dish.
JACK KNOWLES’ EORTY FRIENDS.
A friend in need is a friend indeed, says the
old saw. Quite so. Fair weather friends are
plentiful enough, goodness knows ; the kind that
drop in on you, talk to you, bother you, and
borrow things from you; the kind that never
bring hack that five shillings, but ask for five more
“just to make it ten,” that breed of friends, I
say, are as thick as flies over a sugar-bowl. But
the sort who stick by you when you are down on
your luck, who put their shoulders against j our
cart wheels at a nasty spot in the road—why, you
want to hunt for them with spectacles and a
lantern. Yet, after all, such friends do exist, and
forty of them turned up, without any hunting,
when Mr. Knowles needed them badly. How it
happened he tells us in the following statement.
I, Jonathan Knowles, of Lotton Fen, near
Ramsey, Hunts, do solemnly and sincerely declare
as follows :—I was always a strong healthy man
up to April, 1889, when I began to feel ill. At
first I felt dull, low-spirited and had no energy.
I had a poor appetite and for days and days
could eat nothing. What I did eat laid like lead
on my chest. I had a gnawing, sinking feeling
at the pit of the stomach, and was constantly
sick, vomiting up a green fluid; At times the
heaving and straining was so great that blood
came up. My hands and feet were always cold,
and clammy sweats used to break out all over me.
I never felt warm even when I sat before the fire.
Next a hacking dry cough, with severe pains at
my chest and lungs, began to trouble me, and my
breathing became short and hurried. I soon got
so weak that I had to give up my work, for I
could only walk a few yards without stopping to
take my breath. The cough and shortness of
breath got gradually worse and worse, and I
began to lose flesh rapidly. At first a doctor
from Ramsey came to see me, he gave me
medicines and cod liver oil, but held out no hope
of my getting better, and after attending me
three months he recommended me to go to the
hospital. I got a recommendation from my
master, Mr. David Corney, Wellington House,
St. Mary’s, and went to the Peterborough In-
firmary. I had to be taken in a trap to the
railway station, such was my weak state. The
doctors at the Infirmary had me stripped and
sounded my lungs, and said one of my lungs was
almost gone, and that I was in a consumption.
They gave me medicines, also cod liver oil, but
nothing did me any good. After being under
their care and treatment for three months I was
discharged as incurable. My wife and relations
now lost all hope of my ever getting well again,
and everyone who saw me looked upon me as
being in a decline. My cheeks had sunk and I
had wasted away until I was only a shadow of
my former self, you could even see the sinews
through my flesh. I was nothing but skin and
bone, having lost three stone in weight. I got up
every day but had to sit in an arm-chair all day
long. I could only move a few yards and that
with the aid of a stick. In this half-dead, half-
alive state I continued for nearly two years, and
was looked upon as doomed. During the latter
part my wife did not think I should live from one
week to another, and friends who came to see me
used to say, “Poor Jack will never come out
alive again.” In December, 1890, when I was at
my worst, a neighbour of mine, Mrs. King, True
Briton Inn, told me of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup and gave me half a bottle
of it. I bad no faith in anything doing me any
good but I took it. Having been so long out of
work I could not get money for more of the Syrup.
So strongly were my friends convinced that the
medicine would do me good that a subscription
was started and over 40 people subscribed to enable
me to get a further supply. Mrs. King got the
Syrup from Mr. J. Freeman, Chemist, Ramsey,
and kept me supplied with it. After I had taken
three buttles of the Syrup I felt benefit. I kept
on with the medicine and gradually got stronger
and stronger, and got back to my work. Of
course it took a long time before I properly got
up my strength. I can now do any kind of work,

my recovery. I tell them all that Seigel’s Syrup
has Drought me back to life. I wish others to
know of what has done so much for me, and I
give permission to the Proprietors of the medicine
to make what use they think fit of this state-
ment ; and I make this solemn declaration con-
scientiously believing the same to be true. By

You take notice, of course, that Mr. Knowles
makes a solemn legal declaration to the truth of
his remarkable story. It is so full of suggestive
facts that I could write a book about it. But
there is no time nor room now to do that. The
points to remember are these If the doctors
thought “ Poor Jack ” had consumption they were
mistaken. The fact that be got well shows he
had no consumption. A man who can now walk
14 miles a day has got two good lungs. Doctors
have no business to make such blunders and scare
patients out of all courage and hope. But there !
Ignorance is ignorance, no matter where you run
across it. What ailed Mr. Knowles was in-
digestion and dyspepsia—nothing else. The
cough and loss of flesh were symptoms of that,
not of the destruction of lung substance. Next,
keep bearing in mind that all our common
maladies signify that our machinery for digesting
food is out of order. It is so when it doesn t look
so, the same as when it does.
That is the secret of the success of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. It cleanses the cistern and the
pipes, and then the water of life runs clear and
sweet. Those 40 sensible friends believed in that.
Mr. J. Knowles is a very respectable hard-
working man. He is a farm labourer and has a
small allotment of land which he cultivates. The
persons who subscribed to get him the Syrup are
principally farm labourers and farmers residing in
the district of Ramsey. The case is well known
to all the people round about where Knowles
lives. Mrs. Knowles, in speaking of her husband s
long illness, stated that she never for one moment
expected his recovery. She could see him gradu-
ally dwindling away, and herself and children
could not take their meals for tears when they
saw the dreadful condition Mr. Knowles was in,
for they expected losing him every week

A “ Holy Joe” at Queenscliff (Vic.) has

The agricultural population of England is
5 per cent, of the whole; that of Germany, 45 per
cent.; that of France, 52 per cent. Land
Essex, is (as in lots of other English cen-
tres) practically unsaleable. Land, 20 miles
across the sea (practically sand hills), neighbour-
hood of Calais (as in lots of other French centres),
greedily fetches <£so per acre. In France there is
no tithe ! In England, there is a church-tithe of
<£0,750,000 per annum compulsorily dragged from
the land.
Dear Bulletin, —“Those wretched re-
volvers” are about the only available weapons
for comparatively weak men. A tomahawk in
the hands of a man such as the late Mr. Phillips
would be useless against almost any weapon that
could be picked up at the moment by an athletic
assailant. The revolver’s greatest defect from a
burglar’s point of view is an advantage to the
defender. It makes a noise and attracts atten-
tion. If a man will not fire till the other begins
to tomahawk him that is not the fault of the
revolver. The usual reason for the revolver’s
failure against burglars is that the assailed
fires over the robber’s head.— Saddlestrap.
During the French Revolution, the Mar-
quis de Marville, while standing on the scaffold,
addressed a few words to the assemblage. He was
proceeding to say that ere he died he wished to
open their eyes to the truth, when he was seized
by the executioner and forced under the knife.
With the utmost sang-froid the marquis con-
tinued - “Educated as I was among a privileged
class, I voluntarily abandoned my friends to live
among you ; to earn my daily bread side by side
with you, and I have always acted like a good
patriot.” At this moment the knife fell. The
guillotine was, however, in such constant requi-
sition that it was frequently out of order. LTpon
this occasion the knife fell, but did not sever the
vertebrae, although the flesh was horribly man-
gled. The executioner and his assistants raised
the knife anew. As soon as they had done so the
marquis, still lying face downwards, continued ;
“ As I was saying, fellow-citizens, when I was
interrupted ” And again the knife fell.—

An anonymous correspondent of a Vic-
torian M.P. wants retrenchment practised in the
Melbourne Zoo, or would like to see that institu-
tion abolished. After advocating horseflesh as a
more economical Zoo-diet than beef, when women
and children are starving in the streets, he says
that it has cost Victoria more than .£lOO,OOO to
acclimatise the sparrow, the rabbit and the hare —
national curses and calamities. Further—
The Zoological Society has, I am told, introduced the
squirrel, the otter and the rook. Ask any American what
damage the squirrel can do. Ask the angler how he likes
otters. All English and Irish farmers love the rook. I
thought that our vineyards might have escaped the hands
of the plague-introducing Society, but no ! The large
fruit-iating bat was brought to within a very short
distance of the Heads, where, by good luck, it died—some
40 of it. How pleased our fruit-growers will be if the
next shipment arrives “in good condition!” ....
Natural history is unknown to the authorities. Some
years ago, the Society purchased pelicans in England !
not knowing that they are indigenous here, and are run-
ning about tame in the streets of Inglewood and at the
Pelican Hotel.
At Bundaberg (Q.), recently, three
Kanakas were convicted of killing another cheap
and reliable islander by wilful skull-fracture, and
were then released under the First Offenders
Probation Act. This Act was originally intended
to apply to young offenders convicted for the first
time of some trivial crime, and the idea of
applying it to three full-grown niggers for the
fatal battery of a fourth is strikingly novel.
Probably the explanation is that three Kanakas
are valuable property, and if they were
locked up for ten years—as any white men would
be under like circumstances —it would be just as
serious a loss to their owner as if the law had
sentenced his three best cows to penal servitude
for life, or had given his prize bull a loner term in
gaol. And, in any case, the dead islander didn’t
matter much in a moral sense ; he was only so
much cane-hoeing power lost, and it is no use
crying over spilt Kanaka or throwing good nigger
after bad. The nigger has to be regarded in a
strictly commercial sense before the situation can
be fully appreciated.

gone, the companions of his later life are no more; he is surrounded by tombstones, he vegetates in a graveyard

change their laws, communities their customs, people their habits, in obedience to the law which makes

Every Lady should Read this Carefully
It has been said that some of my preparai ions for the
skin contain poisonous ingredients, or rather ingredient*
that would be poisonous if taken internally and in sulfi
cient quantities. This is not true of my SKIN TONIC,
which contains no such ingredients. I freely admit that
for certain stubborn skin diseases, like all successful
physicians and skin doctors, I do recommend stronger and
more effective pnparations, some of which contain ingre-
dients which, if taken internally and in large quantities,
would be injurious and perhaps poisonous; but when
applied externally and in small quantities, as directed,
they are never injurious, but always beneficial. With
the exception of my Dyspepsia Cure, which is purely
vegetable and consequently harmless, all my pre-
parations are for external use only, and where directions
are followed, it is absolutely impossible for any injurious
results to follow. It is well-known that many of the best
patent medicines and doctors’ prescriptions, for both
external and internal use, contain poisonous ingredients
in small quantities; but it does not in any way follow
that these medicines are injurious. On the coritrarv,
they are usually beneficial when properly used. Ask any
respectable doctor or chemist if this is not the case. 1
give free consultations, and sell most of my preparations
direct to the customer, and for this reason, I sometin;es
antagonise doctors and chemists, as well as my pro-
fessional competitors; but any fair-minded doctor,
chemist, or skin specialist will tell you that every
word I have said is absolutely true. Several prominent
London physicians, who have become better acquainted
with me and my methods, have for some time sent their
“ incurable ” cases to me and I have cured them. MY
CELEBRATED SKIN TONIC contains absolutely no
poisonous or injurious ingredient; is entirely harmless,
and always gives satisfaction. It has for years had the
largest sale throughout the world of any skin lotion, and
is conceded to be the best and only satisfactory prepara-
tion for permanently and harmlessly cleansing the skin
and removing blemishes. After devoting my life to ibe
study and treatment of the skin, I would indeed he foolish
to advertise and sell, at great expense, anything but the
very best of remedies ; and especially anvtiiing i.bat could
by any possibility be injurious. People «bo know me
also know that any preparation made or recommended by
me for the skin can be used with entire » f t\ and bench'.

The Case for the Single-
Tax.
BY JOHN FARRELL.
No. 2.—Thb Qrbat Lookout.
Thb reason why prosperity, ease, and enjoyment
for all workers have not increased with their
ability to produce wealth is that private owner-
ship of land gives the owners power, not only to
take without payment every increase in public
earning, ‘ at to absolutely stop every process of
production.
In every civilised country a very small per-
centage of the population own that part of the
land on which the operations of agricultural pro-
duction, mining, manufacture, exchange, or any-
thing else, can be profitably carried on. This
being so it is plain that labour, the producing
force —which includes capital—can enjoy but the
merest fraction of the difference in advantage
between the least desirable land in use for any
purpose and the most. The rest goes in rent to
the landowners.
In the course of a remarkably able and instruc-
tive lecture recently delivered at Leigh House —a
lecture that ought to be read and digested by
evyy man and woman in this province, and that
should be “as dreadful as the shout of one that
sees to one that sins and thinks himself unseen ”
to the Man in Possession —Mr. Fraser Hill dealt
at considerable length with the distribution of
land and wealth in New South Wales. Six
hundred and fifty-six freeholders own half the
alienated land. Four per cent, of the people
own 90 per cent, of the freehold land;
15 per cent, own it all, and 85 per cent, own
none. I have before me as I write a diagram
carefully prepared from official returns, showing
the distribution of freehold lands in South Aus-
tralia. In the year 1889, 703 persons owned land
aggregating £16,000,000, in separate values of
from .65000 to over =£100,000; 386 persons owned
land totalling .£8,500,000 in values of from £lOOO
to £5OOO ; 5029 owners had £3,600,000 worth in
values of from £5OO to £1000; 11,678 owned
£3,000,000 in values of from £lOO to £500;
18,468 owned £900,000 worth in lots of from the
lowest value up to £lOO, and 111,000 people had
no land. These statistics are all I will need to
quote. They show the position in two of our pro-
vinces. It is practically the same in all of them
and throughout the civilised world.
Such a position means that a small percentage
of the people command the activities of all the
rest as fully as though these were lawfully pur-
chased and perfectly willing cart-horses, without
having as much responsibility as in that case for
their sustenance and well-being.
When land became obtainable in New South
Wales, those who were here first had the pick of
it —as in all new settlements they hare, under
present conditions. So they took the best for
whatever productive purpose they had in view, or
for no productive purpose and just to hold, so that
nobody else could use it without buying permis-
sion either in a lump sum as purchase money or
in periodical payments as rent. The richest of
the lands within easy distance of the central
settlement were soon apportioned among a few
owners.
At the beginning the chief use to which
land was put was the raising of grain
and meat for the small community. As
the community grew the necessity for
exchanging centres, such as stores and agencies,
caused new productive uses to arise. Later, the
same cause brought into use mineral lands. The
persons who owned the best of the lands, for
whatever purpose specially suitable, had with
their ownership obtained an advantage over other
members of the community, saleable for an in-
creasing share of the production of others as the
growth of population reduced the productive
quality of the land obtainable by them without
rent payment.
The best agricultural and pastoral lands, for in-
stance, having been secured under freehold tenure
by certain persons, these persons would have the
power to t,»ke as rent the earnings of others to
whom no hind as good was open on the same
terms. To have secured ownership of land more
productive because of rainfall, soil, water front-
age, neighbourhood to market, or any other cause
than is accessible to others is to have secured a
means of preying upon and legally stealing from
those others. A has a farm on which 20 bushels
of wheat per acre can be grown, and which is in
the be>t possible position as regards accessibility
to market. B, the next coming settler, cannot
get quite so good an opportunity to follow the
business of agriculture. The land may be as
rich, but it is further away from a centre of popu-
lation or has other drawbacks which, set off
against the product, reduce it to 19 bushels. As
soon as B found that he could not otherwise ob-
tain the use of land returning more than 19
bushels, he would readily fall in with such a pro-
posal as this from A: “My land returns 20
bushels, use it and pay me half-a-bushel per acre
rent, then you will receive half-a-bushel per acre
more return than on any other land open to you.”
Thus, if A owned a large quantity of such land he
could at even that early stage abandon the habit
of producing, and live on the tributary half-
bushels of B. With the advent of O things would
become much more satisfactory for him, and much
less so for B. 0, not being able to get anything
better than 19-bushel land, would offer A three-
quarters of a bushel rent for each of the acres B
was using. At the expiration of his lease B would
shift back to 19-bushel land, and A begin to go on
exhibition before visibly-impressed tea-meetings
as a man made of self-raising clay. He would
also advocate the return to Parliament only of
men who had a stake in the country.
As the demand for land bo use grew with growing
population, so would A wax more and more pros-
perous, out of naked and unashamed legalised
looting. Anyone can look along a clear line of
sequence and perceive that this must be so. The
arrival of D, E, F, G, and all the rest of them
would raise the rental value of his land. Each of
these misguided persons would find that the land
open to use by him was less productive than that ob-
tained by his immediate predecessor. The quality
of land available would become uniformly worse
as occupation spread further out from the general
centre. The amount of rental that A could exact
from his tenant slaves would become uniformly
higher, and the proportion of their own product
which they could retain for their own use uni-
formly lower. When 12-bushel land became the
best alternative, A, having 20-bushel land for
lease, could obtain an annual rental of seven and
three-quarter bushels, and the condition of the
cultivators would have become correspondingly
worse.
The same system works out to the same result
in every branch of production. Let us look at the
manufacturing and exchanging industries, which
are as truly productive as those in which men
devote themselves to cultivating. Let us regard
A as the owner of the best site existing in N.S.
Wales for purposes of manufacture or exchange.
He can lease that site at such a rental that the
occupier and user of it is but slightly better
situated than he would be on the least desirable
site in use for a similar purpose anywhere within
reach. As with the farmer, so with the shopkeeper,
merchant, professional man, and everybody whose
business is to do anything useful to society. As
the volume of the business he may do, or the satis-
fiable demand for his services, increases, so does the
prioehehas to pay for permission to occupyaground
floor suitable to his purpose. Every extension of
population lowers “the margin of production ” in
his calling as truly as in that of the agriculturist
or pastoralist by increasing his rent.
In New South Wales at the present time there
are hundreds of “selectors” endeavouring, by
hard, continuous work, to make a livelihood. You
can find them in the hungry bush, twenty or fifty
miles from the nearest railway-station, which may
be three hundred miles from Sydney, the principal
market for most of what they are trying to grow.
The selector is handicapped by bad land, uncer-
tain rainfall, a location beset with disadvantages
of every kind, and heavy railway freights on his
produce. Tell this selector that there are millions
upon millions of acres of rich land waiting for the
plough comparatively close to Sydney, and with
steady rainfall, and ask him why he does not
cultivate some of these. He will tell you that the
private owners do not want to have them culti-
vated, or else demand a rental which, if he paid
it, would leave him hardly a better chance of
return than where he now is.
Go to the interior towns where drapers, watch-
makers, butchers, and tradesmen of all sorts are
grubbing along. You will find that, in most*
cases, “ civility and strict attention to business ”
means working like horses and getting as much
work for as little pay as possible out of everyone
they employ. They manage to live and pay
expenses, with a greater average chance of lapsing
into insolvency than of ultimately obtaining
enough wealth to keep their old age (if they
should not die of work and worry before then) free
from actual want. Tell any of these that in Syd-
ney 10, 20, 50 times as much business of his kind
is to be done in any of a hundred particular places.
He will tell you that there is also 10, 20, or 50
times the rent to pay ; that the Sydney tradesman
gets hardly a better average return for his labour
or capital than he could make in any back-block
town or village.
That is plainly true. There is as much com-
petition, according to their advantage, for sites on
which to conduct businesses in one part of the
province as in another. Consequently, the man
who leases a shop or builds a factory in Sydney has
no better average chance of gaining thereby than
he who does the same thing in any place where the
opportunity is worth using at all. Competition
between land-users for land to use settles that.
Consequently, labour and capital receive a smaller
share of their joint product as the number of persons
needing the use of land increases, while the land-
owners' unearned share proportionately grows.
To what could such a state of things tend but to
the impoverishment of the many and the enrich-
ment of the few ? Every industrial advance, every
improvement in production, instead of bettering
the general condition of the people, whose labour
in supplying their needs should thus be lessened,
raises rent. The wealth thus handed over to land-
owners is largely used as a means of increasing
their power to extort. How “investment” in
land proceeds in this province anyone can find on
reference to Mr. Coghlan, who shows the rate at
which transfers progress. It is the same else-
where. The obtainment of land, mining, railway,
water-power, and other privileges, all based upon
monopoly of natural elements, is the principal use
to which that part of individual wealth not con-
sumed by the owner is being put. Every year in
New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland,
Victoria, England, and the United States the
power of land-ownership to levy toll and to check
production grows visibly.
What is an “ investment in land ?” If a man
has to buy, or rent, land for use from a private
owner it represents the penalty which landlordism
exacts before he will be allowed to produce any-
thing for, or render any service to, the community.
It is wealth wrongfully taken from him without
any return, under the processes of an immoral law,
and is, therefore, a dead loss every time. The
other form of investment in land is exactly the
same in principle as the investment a bushranger
makes when he buys a revolver with which to
render his ground solid when demanding the
money or the life of passers-by, with the exception
that it is legal, more effective, and considerably
worse. If I invest £>looo in land, how can I, as
landowner, get more than .£lOOO out of it ? By
preventing anybody from using it until he buys
me off —there is no other way. By establishing to
the extent of my “investment ” a lock-out against
those who would otherwise use that land for the
benefit of themselves and others, unless they pay
me out of their produce something over what I
have paid for the revolver—that is to say, for the
title-deed. This look-out is as perfectly workable
as though I had been able to remove that particular
piece of land out of the world until someone paid
me to bring it back.
So, on every hand, we see people insufficiently
supplied with desirable things which others would
gladly exchange with them for the things they
would purchase if they were allowed to produce.
They are not so allowed. They are locked out.
If they have not the gate-money which landlord-
ism asks, they cannot go in to the store-house of
raw material to apply their labour. They can
starve outside, miserably prey upon each other,
and die in slums and gutters, as they do. If they
are able to elbow their way in, the rent-agreement
is such that they are kept down to so low a share
of what they earn that they fight bitterly over the
merest crumbs of it. “Your money or your life,”
the man at the gate says, and he has the pull.
“Over production,” some say, looking at the
crammed shops and warehouses whose conductors
find business diminishing, and to whose attend-
ants wages become lower and employment more
precarious. It is true that every market is glutted
with things for sale; every shelf loaded. Drapers,
farmers, grocers, furniture-makers, cannot find
buyers. But how many are there who are in such
need of all the things these tradesmen could
supply that they would gladly purchase them if
they had means to do so, and who would find
ample means if others again were able to employ
them in producing things they could produce if
permitted ? Under - consumption is what is
the matter, because people are locked out and
cannot go to work at producing by exchange all
they want.
Private land-ownership not only cancels to the
producers the benefits of increased production,
but makes this very power to produce more and
more a whip of scorpions for their backs. Every
advance of productive ability under present con-
ditions means increased power of the land-
monopolist to obtain the things or services he
desires with a diminished employment of human
labourers, in whom he has no further interest.
The more serviceable mechanical appliances
become the fewer men the landowner requires to
work for him. “So long,” Henry George wrote
in reply to the Pope’s encyclical letter, “as some
men are treated as owners of the earth, and other
men can live on it only by their sufferance, human
wisdom can devise no means by which the evils
of our present condition may be avoided. Nor
yet could the wisdom of God. . . . Should He
infuse new vigour into the sunlight, new virtue
into the air, new fertility into the soil, would not
all this new bounty go to the owners of land and
work not benefit but rather injury to mere
labourers ? Should He open the minds of men to
the possibilities of new substances, new adjust-
ments, new powers, could this do any more to
relieve poverty than steam, electricity, and all the
numberless discoveries and inventions of our time
have done? Or if He were to send down from the
heavens above, or cause to gush up from the sub-
terranean depths, food, clothing, all the things
that satisfy man’s material desires, to whom,
under our laws, would all these belong? So far
from benefiting man, would not this increase and
extension of His bounty prove but a curse, enabling
the privileged class more riotously to roll in wealth
and bringing the disinherited class to more wide-
spread starvation and pauperism ?”
Dear Bulletin, —JRe that alleged explorer,
Calvert, to whom you have referred of late. He
really was “Out Back” once. There is a river
named after him in the Northern Territory, 230
miles from Burketown, on the Port Darwin track.
I have a vivid recollection of it, for it was there
in ’B4 that I “ dispersed ” my first blackfellow by
means of a Winchester rifle and the Queen’s name,
both lent to me for the occasion by a sub-
inspector of native police.— Strikealight. Gul-
gong (N.S.W.).
[Our correspondent confuses the “alleged explorer”
of Western Australia with Calvert, of Leichhardt’s first
expedition in 1844-45, after whom the Carpentaria River
was named. Other rivers in that Gulf, notably the Gil-
bert and Roper, owe their names to members of the same
party. So far as we know, Leichhardt’s Calvert, who, if
still alive, must be a very old man, is no relation of the
advertising Englishman, who claims to have found a
mountain of gold.—Ed. B.]
The pastoral interest is amused. S.M,
Herald has a new contributor, “ E.E.D.,” who,
bewailing city people’s ignorance of affairs
bucolic, proceeds to let the world know, in a
column-and-a-quarter, how sheep are shorn. For
instance, the shearing-machine is “ a clipper much
like that used in the stable, worked by steam
supplied from a central engine through long india-
rubber tubes.” Fancy the language of “Jim the
Ringer ” trying to shear a big ram and getting
the long india-rubber tube full of red-hot steam
round his neck! Also, the wool-rollers “cut off
the locks, skirtings, and soiled parts” from the
fleece —a wool-roller with a knife is a novelty—
and the horse-team taking a load of wool to the
township moves along to “a running fire of pistol
shots from the stockwhip.” “8.8. D.” must
simply be a distinguished literary visitor from
’Ome, so newly-arrived that the mosquitoes still
smell the lime-juice—
There came a new-chum in a ship,
His name was E.E.D.
He went up-country on a trip
To see what he could see.
And there upon “primeval plains,”
’Mid “ virgin forests ” co»ol,
He got a sheep-tick in his brains,
Which set them gathering wool.
And when into a shed he strolled.
The shearers could not see
That he was not a sheep, and so
They fleeced poor E. E. D.
The lovely ignorance of S.M. Herald in print-
ing such cockneyisms somehow recalls a O.Q. snake
incident. In a coast town there lived a young
English doctor who had just arrived as his
brother’s locum-tenens. Twenty miles from the
township a girl was bitten by a tiger-snake.
Doctor Newchum was sent for; meanwhile the
local blacksmith cut a piece as big as half-a-crown
out of the girl’s calf, which he then tied up with
rag. The bandage was unwound on arrival of the
doctor, who, fixing his eye-glass in position, bent
down and examined the wound. “Haw!” said
he, “ I weally should nevah have believed that a
serpent could possibly have inflicted so extensive
an injuwy. I pwesume it must have—aw—bitten
her more than once. ”
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

Dear Bulletin, —Re mirage. “D.” is

When Should Moa Marry?
What is a good time for men to marry ? The
question is rather more apropos just now than
commonly, since it is raised by the newly-issued
volume of the census returns, where it is shown
that quite a staggering number of boy and girl
marriages take place, especially in the big towns.
However favourably one may be disposed to look
upon the married state, husbands of 16 and wives
of 14 and 15 are a little trying to one’s patience,
and there are many such in every populous centre.
What is more remarkable still, there is quite a
considerable number of widows who are under 15.
The Registrar-General’s statistics do not, of
course, explain how these early unions have come
about, but I fear there is too great a tendency on
the part of the clergy of all denominations to en-
courage wedlock among the immature on the
ground that it is a safeguard against “sin.” A
safeguard against “sin” it may be for the time
being in their technical sense, but I fancy that if
the course of these boy and girl marriages were
watched, say, for five or ten years, they would
not, even from the ecclesiastical point of view, be
entitled to much commendation. If you bar out
sin in one direction you open the door to it in
another. Much of the poverty, the squalor, the
misery, the drunkenness, and the crime of great
cities may be traced to early marriages, and if the
souls of a given couple receive a technical white-
washing by the reading of the marriage service,
what of their unhappy offspring, born into sur-
roundings where no provision is made for their
support? Marriage is a very fine institution, and
I am one of its defenders, but, like all other bless-
ings, it may be abused.
* # *
I can conceive of no sufficient excuse for any lad
marrying under the age of 20, or any girl under
18, and I am sure that both lad and lass would be
the better morally as well as physically for being
restrain'd from marriage up to the limit named.
To the moral side of the question very little atten-
tion is given, and the word moral I use not in its
Exeter Hall but in its metaphysical sense. I will
not attempt to speak from the woman’s point of
view—some of my intelligent correspondents may
be willing to do that. From the other point of
view, I would say, without hesitation, that the
moral effects of a youth’s marrying in his teens
are fraught with great danger to the future
stability of the menage. If there is one generali-
sation more,than another that may safely be made
with regard to men, it is that, in the language of
the poets, they are inclined to rove. They are
morally built that way, just as a woman’s nature
impels her to fidelity. Now, I venture to think
that there are few masculine natures that could be
content with such experiences of life and love out-
side the conjugal bond as are to be gained before
the age of 20. In other words, there are few men
who are in a position to settle down at 20 so as to
cause their chosen partner no further anxieties;
and as fidelity is a necessary condition of married
happiness on both sides, it follows that a too early
assumption of the matrimonial yoke is subjecting
human nature to an excessive strain.
* * #
In these remarks I have no doubt been treading
upon the susceptibilities of those who advocate
the equality of the sexes in all things. I have
before me as I write a circular from the Woman’s
Emancipation Union, in which all sorts of mas-
culine monopolies are sought to be broken down,
including, of course, the right of voting for mem-
hers of Parliament. With the pretensions of these
advanced ladies, as a whole, 1 am not now con-
Z “l “onPof To
se xes, which is, 1 believe, a stock theme at all
blue-stoeking’d gatherings. The theory consis-
tently preached by these petticoated fanatics is
m f n an 4. women ought to be judged by the
same standards of purity and propriety. If this
is rig ht, [ would as £ wh ' womer \ h^ve / ot already
begun the process, for it is they who are the great
offenders against the New Morality by their readi-
“®Bß *° c °ndone all breaches of it by their male
°- f ur v se > W this question
upon abstract principles, but I prefer to quote a
living and actual example of the hollowness of
the emancipation doctrine. I find it in a Lanca-
shire paper, and it relates to persons occupying a
somewhat humble sphere of life. In fact, it is the
romance or the tragedy of a collier’s marriage, and
it came before the local justices in the form of a
demand by a bride of a few months’standing for
“maintenance” at the expense of her husband,
After a certain period of sweethearting the parties
had entered upon intimate terms in the month of
October. Soon afterwards the woman urged that
there were special reasons why they should
marry without delay, and the man, accepting
those reasons as genuine, acted upon them in a
manly and straightforward way. The marriage
took place in December. A month later the com-
plainant’s condition became as alarming as that
of the “widow countrywoman” spoken of by
Montaigne, who, with a reputation for chastity
and honesty upon which she plumed herself, found
herself unaccountably on the eve of increasing
the population. Painful explanations, in fact,
could no longer be avoided. The woman con-
fessed to a previous intimacy with another man,
and made good her words by becoming a mother
in the month of March. A few days before this
latter event the husband left his erring wife under
circumstances which the local Bench interpreted
as a separation by mutual consent.
* • •
Not to put too fine a point upon it, the humble
household breaks up because the woman is with
child to another man, and was so three months
before she had anything to do with her husband,
How does the equality theory work out in this
case? Let us reverse the circumstances. It comes
to the knowledge of a young wife, let us say
shortly after her marriage, that six months pre-
viously her husband had had a gallant adventure
of the most casual description in another part of
the country. Would it occur to her that this was
a ground for breaking up her newly-formed home?
I venture to think not. Even the most advanced
member of the Women’s Emancipation Union
would draw the line somewhere short of that
quixotic action. For the cases of the man and
the woman as above set forth are radically differ-
ent. Of the man’s fault nothing remains, so far
as can directly concern his wife, except a senti-
ment; the woman’s, on the contrary, has left the
most tangible traces, seeing that she throws upon
her husband the responsibility of maintaining a
child which is not his, but to which, nevertheless,
he is compelled by law to give his name. Such a
hardship as this—a terribly rankling one, which
might be felt not for weeks or months, but for
years, and possibly for a lifetime—could not by
any chance be inflicted upon the female partner in
the matrimonial firm, and to talk of equality in
such cases deserves an epithet which, dealing as I
am with ladies, however mistaken in their views,
I am loth to apply.
# * #
Lest I should be thought to be exaggerating the
pretensions of the emancipated, I will quote a
passage from a lecture delivered the other day by
“AnnaS. Swan,” the novelist, known in private
life, I believe, as Mrs. Burnett Smith. “Nor
should girls entertain the idea,” says this would-
be authority, “ that a man was no worse for having
been a little wild. Would any man reverse the
position and admit as much in respect of the
woman he intended to make his wife ?” No ; 1
really must not permit myself to qualify such
mistaken assertions as they deserve. I suppose
they are honestly made. The opinion expressed
by Mrs. Burnett Smith is a sort of pious opinion
which invariably breaks down the moment it
comes into contact with facts. In the region of
morals, above all, the doctrine applies that what-
ever is is right. It might be a better or a worse
world if the equality principle as between
the sexes were established. That I do not dis-
cuss. All I maintain is that women have under-
taken the regulation of this matter since the world
began, and that they have regulated it in a sense
opposed to the pious opinion of the emancipated
agitators. Women’s greatest triumph is reclama-
tion. Over one sinner that repents under their
influence they rejoice more than they would over
any number of just men made perfect. I have
rather drifted away from the question as to the
age at which men ought to marry. In truth,
however, that question has been solved ambu-
lando. On the ground of their inability to main-
tain a wife youths ought to be restrained from
marriage, but the question of pecuniary means is,
after all, only one element in the situation. In
every well-assorted union there are many complex
sentiments to be considered, sentiments to which
the Exeter Hall moralist gives no heed, and of
the very existence of which for the most part he
is ignorant; and at a tender age those sentiments
are undeveloped. Prudential marriages are, per-
haps, becoming a little too common, especially in
the middle classes, where the marrying age is
getting later and later. Every healthy man ought
to be married at thirty, and every healthy woman
at two or three and twenty. That would be my
Utopia. Unfortunately, the census-returns show
that we are getting further and further away
from it.-

They were two chaps named Gory and Blanky.
They were tramping from Nevermineware to
Smotherplace. Gory was a bad egg, and Blanky
knew it; but they’d fallen in with each other on
the track and agreed to travel together for the
sake of company. Blanky had <£2s, which fact
was known to Gory, who was stumped.
Every night Gory tried to get the money, which
fact was known to Blanky, who never slept with
more than one eye shut.
When their tracks divided, Gory said to
Blanky :
“Look a-here ! Where the deuce do you keep
that stuff of yourn ? I’ve been tryin’ to get holt

“ I know you have,” said Blanky.
“ Well, where the blazes did you put it?”
“ Under your head !”
“The , you did !”
They grinned, shook hands, and parted; and
Gory scratched his head very hard and very often
as he tramped along the track.

Should Bachelors be Taxed ?
This subject is now exciting public attention,
and opinions appear equally divided for and
against the proposition. On the one hand, the
liberty of the subject is attacked, on the other
the degeneracy of our national life is brought into
prominence—both are equally vital interests. It
is a matter for surprise that young Australia should
ignore the contentment and felicity of married
life. Our climate is responsible, in a great
measure, for this state of things; but this is no
excuse, and, to condemn the large numbers of
marriageable women to single blessedness is mons-
trous and unnatural, and the stigma of reproach
for selfishness and personal gratification, rests
with the colonial unmarried man. In any case,
the nerve-power must be deficient, for if it were
not, what is so eminently natural and productive
of happiness, would be eagerly adopted. If the
timid and bashful young man were to take si,
course of the great Australian remedy fur nervous
weakness, “Marshall’s Tonic Nervine,” a revul-
sion would at once take place in the marriage
market. It is a vitalising, strengthening and in-
vigorating medicine. It cannot fail in its results
and is within the reach of all. N.B. —Dr. Ewing-
ton, who has been practising in this colony for
about 30 years, writes: “ Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine is a most efficacious remedy in the treat-
ment of nervous debility, and I have found it
superior to all other tonics with my patients.”

THE COOK OF THE SPREETOO SANTOO.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We were in Kitti Harbour, at Ponape, in
the Carolines, when, at breakfast, a bleary-eyed,
undersized, more-or-less-white man in a dirty pink
shirt and dungaree pants, came below, and, sling-
ing his filthy old hat over to the transoms, shoved
himself into a seat between the mate and Jim
Garstang, the trader.
“Mornin’, captin’,” said he without looking at
the skipper, and helping himself to about two
pounds of curry.
“ Morning to you. Who the deuce are you,
anyway? Are you the old bummer they call
* Espiritu Santo ? ” said Garstang.
“Thats me. I’m the man. But I ain’t no
bummer, don’t you b’lieve it. I wos tradin’ round
here in these (lurid) islands afore you coves
knowed where Ponape was.”
“Are you the skunk that Wardell kicked off
the Shenandoah for stealing a bottle of wine ?”
said the mate.
“That’s me. There was goin’ ter be trouble
over that on’y that the Shennydor got properly
well sunk by the Allybarmer, and that
Wardell got d d well drownded. Hingland
haint a-goin’ to let no Yankee insult nobody for
Ruthin’—an| I’m a blessed Englishman. I didn’t
steal the wine. Wardell arst me off to dinner,
and then we gets talkin’ about polertics, an’ I
tells ’im ’e wos a lyin’ pirut. Then he started
foolin’ around my woman, an’ I up with a bottle
of wine an’
“Why, you thundering liar,” said Garstang,
“you stole it out of the ward-room.”
“I wouldn’t call no man a liar if I was you,
Mister—by G , that Chinaman cook knows
how to make curry.”
He ate like a starving shark, and between
mouthfuls kept up a running fire of lies and blas-
phemy. When he had eaten three platefuls of
curry and drunk enough coffee to scald a pig, the
skipper, who was getting tired of him, asked him
if he had had enough.
Yes. He had had enough breakfast to last him
a whole (Australian adjective) week.
“ Then clear out on deck and swab the curry off
your face, you beast.”
“That’s always the way with you tradin’
skippers. A stranger don’t get no civility unless
he comes aboard in a (red painted) gig with a
(crimson) umbrella and a (gory) ’elmet ’at, like a
(vermillion) Consul.”
The mate seized him, and, running him up the
companion way, slung him out on deck.
* • *
“ What do you think of him ? ” asked the
skipper, a man fond of a joke—it was Bully
Hayes. “ I thought I’d let you all make his
acquaintance. He’s been bumming around the
Ladrones and Pelews since ’5O ; used to be cook on
a Manilla trading brig, the Espiritu Santo.”
Then he told us how this wandering mass of
blasphemy got his name of “Spreetoo Santoo.”
While in the brig, he had been caught smuggling
at Guam by the guarda costas, and had spent a
year or two in the old prison fort at San Juan de
’Apra. (I don’t know how he got out; perhaps
his mherently-alcoholic breath and lurid bias-
phemy made the old brick walls tumble down.)
After that he was always welcome in sailors’
foc’s’les by reason of his smuggling story, which
would commence with—“ When I was cook on
the Espiritu Santo (only he used the English in-
stead of the Spanish name), I got jugged by the
gory gardy costers,” &c., &o.
* * *
When we came on deck he was sitting on
the main-hatch, with the Chinese carpenter (whose
pipe he was smoking), and telling him that he
ought to get rid of his native wife, who was a
Gilbert Island girl, and buy a Ponape girl.
“I can git yer the pick o’ the (crimson) island,
an’ it won’t cost yer more’n a few (unprintable)
dollars. I’m a (bad word) big man ’ere, among the
(adjective) natives,”
Hung looked up at him stolidly with half-closed
eyes. r lhen he took the pipe out of his mouth
and said in a deadly cold voice :
“ You palally liar, Spleetoo.”

He slouched aft again presently and asked
the mate, in an amiable tone of voice, if he had
“any (ruddy) noospapers from Sydney.”
“ What the devil do you want newspapers for?”
enquired Hayes, turning round suddenly in his
deck-chair, “you can’t read, Spreetoo.”
“Can’t read, eh ?” and his red-rimmed, lashless
eyes simulated intense indignation, “Wot about
that ’ere (red) bishop at Manilla, as wanted me
to chuck up me (scarlet) billet on the Spreetoo
Santoo and travel through the (carnaged) Carryline
Grewp as ’s (sanguinary) sekketerry? ’Cos why?
’Cos there aint any (blank) man a’tween ’ere an’
’ell as can talk the warious lingoes like me.”
“ Here,” said the mate, giving him two or three
old Maori land newspapers, “ here’s some Auckland
papers. Know anybody there? ”
“No,” he answered promptly, “not a soul, but
he ‘ knowed Sydney well. Larst time I wos there
I sold old Bobby Towns £6OOO worth of oil—a
bloomin’ shipful—l got drunk an’ a blank police-
man went through me in the cell and took the
whole blessed lot outer me (scarlet) pocket.” (Nine
bad words omitted.)
“ Bank notes? ” queried Bully.
“No, sovreigns— gory sovreigns.”

He asked us if we had seen any men-o’-
war about lately, and said that the captain of
H.M.S. had wanted to marry his daughter,
but he wouldn’t let her marry no man-o’-war cove
after the way that Warded had treated him.
He thought he would go back to Sydney again for
a spell. His brother had a flaming fine billet
there.
“What is he?” asked Hayes.
“’E’s a (blessed) Soopreme Court Judge, wears
a (gory) wig big enough to make chafin’ gear for a
(crimson) fleet o’ ships, ’e lives at Guvment ’Ouse
and ’e’s rollin’ in money an’ drinks like a (car-
mine) fish. I thought I might see somethin’ about
the in a (blank) Sydney noospaper. I’ll come
in for all his (ensanguined) money when ’e dies.”
Bully gave him a bottle of gin after a while.
Then he hurriedly bade us farewell and went
ashore

Dear Bulletin, —Your sketch, “On a
Dry Plain,” about a poor devil who died of thirst,
awakes a memory. Something under 30 years ago
—it was the week after the Long Tunnel had its
first crushing—l was returning on horseback from
Stringer’s Creek (now Walhalla, Vie.) to Woods’
Point. The first night I stopped at the only pub.
there then was between the two places. Next
morning, before I started, I got the landlady to
fill me a soda-water-bottle with whisky and milk,
as I had 30 miles to ride without passing a house,
or waters —6000 ft. high, along the Great Divide.
It was the middle of summer. I had gone nine
miles beyond Mt. LTseful—so named because there
is a small lake on its summit—when I came across
a poor fellow lying at the side of the track, with
his head on his swag. He could just gasp—“ How
far to water?” “Nine miles.” “It’s a ease”—
and he turned over, I dismounted and poured
some of my mixture into his pannikin. He sat
up and drank it. To see the change that came
oyer that poor man’s face was a lesson in “medi-
cine.” In reply to questions, he told me he had
been drinking for three weeks at the Black River
and had that morning started for Stringer’s. I
made him finish the bottle. “ These blasted hills
cooked me, but, look here, boss, if I should live
for 100 years, I’ll never forget you. Only nine
miles to water ? I can do it like a bird now.” I
wonder if he did !—Yours, T.G.0., Williams-
road, Windsor (Vic.).

cold but frozen. Thirty years ago he
got a judgment for <£29 12s. 3d. against
one Gooley, and, having got it, he seems to have
put it away under the bed, and slept on it, and
waited. He waited altogether for a trifle over 30
years. Then he hunted up Gooley, who had
become a reasonably prosperous farmer, and had
his land and cattle, said to be worth £635,
auctioned by the sheriff—for £26 ss. When Gooley
had partially recovered from the shock, he took
proceedings before Judge Casey, who considered
the thing for a while and then referred the matter
to Judge Hamilton. Judge Hamilton decided
that the sale was illegal and quashed it—which
was gratifying in its way, only it didn’t neces-
sarily bring back Gooley’s homestead, or his lost
cows, but the decision was reversed by Judge
A’Beckett. Then Gooley proceeded against Finn
for trespass, and the matter was argued before
Judge Holroyd, who sent it to the Supreme Court,
where it remained, on a late date. Considering
the law-costs and all the rest of the ruin, Finn’s
long-deferred vengeance on Gooley seems to be
making good progress.

Editor Bulletin, — Be “mongrel breed-
ing?” Do not ethnologists assert that mongrels
possess superior intelligence to pure-bred persons?
Also, that genius is mostly mongrel? I am a
mongrel myself.—Yours, &c., Wurry M. [There
is no hard-and-fast ethnological law of genius.
Because the offspring of parents who are them-
selves closely related by blood is frequently of
weak mind or body, or both, it does not neces-
sarily follow that, the farther off in racial extrac-
tion a husband is from his wife, the more vigorous
in either bodily or mental capacity will be their
children. A vivid imagination may create for
itself an ideal mongrel, who shall be gifted with
all the strong points and burdened with none of
the racial -weaknesses of the various breeds of his
mixed-up progenitors; but history, so far as
off-hand memory serves, has not yet produced a
typical instance of any such mongrel achievement.
Logical consideration of the common-sense aspect
of results experienced in all sorts—or any sort—of
breeding experiment leads to the adoption of some
such theory as this, as far as any theory may be
reasonably held on such a widely debatable theme:
Genius in a mongrel cannot owe its presence
solely, or even chiefly, to the mongrel inter-
mixture ; it may far more reasonably be assigned
to the accidental predominance and isolation in
one general set of faculties of one special gift, or
more than one special gift, hereditarily charac-
teristic of some particular breed of humans— i.e.,
genius in a mongrel is the predominance of a
pure-bred part, or pure-bred parts, over the mon-
grel whole. Any ethnologist who rashly asserted
that mongrelism per se favours the development
of genius, would have to account otherwise for a
multitude of hard facts illustrated by the mental
brilliancy, the physical eminence, and the longevity
of those racial phenomena—pure-bred Hebrews.
Judicious cross-breeding might certainly achieve
wonders, but the life-principle rests certainly in
the initial “value” of the “seed.”—Ed. B.]

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Orang Matu, the head man of Tibak, in Borneo,
hadn’t been to Singapore and Calcutta for nothing.
He let the missionaries pour into him as much
doctrine as they pleased—there might be some
truth in these things, he said, for had not the
Prophet himself spoken approvingly of Jesus Ben -
Miriam ? But when they came to the weary old
corollary that the bringers of the Bible were also
everywhere the bringers of moral and social re-
generation, the Orang jibbed and asked certain
questions which have never been answered, and
never will be.
One of the missionaries said nothing ; the other
tried to impose upon an acuter man than himself
the time-honoured commonplaces of his trade.
The Orang smiled and bade him tell all that to
the Dyaks. Which was exactly what he did, so
that in time he had made Christians by the dozen.
They said they were, at all events, and, no doubt,
while the guns and axes lasted—and the pictures
and the looking-glasses and the scarlet cloth—
their Christianity was about as good as the
average white article. But they were all Dyaks,
and the other gospeller, who had gone a-fishing
for the more sophisticated Malay soul, caught
nothing.
This, said the reverend brother, was because he
was a schismatic and had not the truth in him. So
the two dwelt apart, and Morton, the unorthodox,
suffered contumely at the hands of the other
man’s strong-smelling proselytes. One day this
culminated. Hankey, the successful soul-catcher,
came with half-a-dozen of his shark-toothed
Christians and pulled Morton’s hut about his ears.
“You are no better yourself than one of the
heathen ! ” quoth reverend Hankey. “You had
better get back to Sarawak, and leave the good
work in the hands which the Lord has so signally
marked out for it! ”
Morton didn’t go to Sarawak; he went to Matu.
“ And why comest thou to me, Christ man?”
asked the Orang, when he had heard the story.
“ What can I do? ”
“Thou canst keep these Dyaks in order, Matu,
Thee they dare not disobey, if thou wilt give me
thy protection for the future.”
“ Talk not of DyaKs—black sons of Sheitan !
they are already but as dead dogs for this! Speak
to me rather of this other Christ-man, who ven-
tures to pull down houses within the shadow of
Matu, which is more than Serjam Beruk ” (Sir
James Brooke) “ the great white Rajah himself—
would dare to do ! What shall be done unto
him ? ”
“ Nothing, O Matu; do him no evil.”
The Orang looked at Morton intently for a full
minute—then rose swiftly from his tiger-skin and
grasped the hilt of his parang-latok ; whereupon a
white-headed old Sasgi-man, crippled with the
rheumatism of his native swamps, hobbled eagerly
forward, so that, when the blow fell, the white
man’s spurting blood might work a cure upon his
dingy old carcase. But Matu let go the weapon
again and spoke with a smile.
“ It is in Matu’s mind, Christ-man, that from
this faith of yours ye learn, when one cheek is
smitten, to turn the other to the striker. Say—is
it so ?”
“ It is even so, Matu 1”
“A strange teaching, truly!—and one that
suits Borneo but ill. Still ,” and in the
twinkling of an eye the Orang had struck
Morton across the face, and had in turn been
knocked flat on his back by a drive in the wind
from the white man’s fist. Parangs and kreeses
flashed out by the dozen, but the cat-like Malay
was on his feet in an instant,
“Enough, my children! - ’ he cried. “It is
good. The white man hath done well, but he is
no Christian ! He asketh not for vengeance with
his mouth, but words are women and deeds are
men. See now, O Christ-man—thy religion is
naught, but thou art a man, and the friend of
Matu. He owes thee a gift. Go now with these
men, eat and drink, and in the space of an hour
shall Matu’s present come to thee.”
Then Morton, astonished to find his head still
on his shoulders, was taken down the long house
and up into the mifae, and here, when he had
eaten and drunken, he smoked Javani tobacco
and awaited the Orang’s present. Within the
hour it came.
It was the head of Hankey !
CAPRICORNS
“ He has some talent, but no chin.”—
Critic.
One Cavanagh, an old-time London police,
inspector, has published a volume of reminiscences-
There is just one good story in the book. It con-
cerns a forger who got away to New York with
.£lO,OOO in Bank of England notes. For some
unexplained reason there seems to have been no
pursuit—probably the police were on a wrong
track in Central Asia ; but he took it for granted
that he was closely followed, and he lay low in an
obscure hotel and waited in fear and trembling for
the large flat feet of an enemy on the staircase.
At last one day the tension on his nerves became
so bad that he drank a whole bottle of brandy by
way of finding oblivion, and went to sleep. In
his sleep he had dismal visions of policemen pur-
suing him, and saw himself arrested and sen-
tenced to a billion ages of hard stone-breaking.
He was awakened by someone shaking him furi-
ously and telling him that a gentleman insisted on
seeing him, and he suddenly realised that the
long-expected detective had come. In his un-
strung condition his one idea was to destroy the
evidence of his crime, so he sent the greasy waiter
shuffling downstairs to show up the visitor, and
the instant his back was turned he crowded
<£lo,ooo worth of notes into the fire, and held
them down with the shovel till they were con-
sumed. Then a tall man in black stalked in,
and said, apologetically, that he was going round
the neighbourhood to try and raise some
money for the little iron church in the next
street, and though he felt he had no claims
upon a mere casual visitor, yet a few dollars
—but here the auditor broke into such a yell
of brassy laughter that the clergyman seized
his plug hat and fled in affright. Then the penni-
less forger went out to raise the price of a bed by
stealing some clothes off a line, and after leading
a precarious existence for a time he was arrested
and got a long sentence, and during a bilious
attack in gaol he told his story to the chaplain.
What a drama could be built out of this story
with Titheradge as the forger, and Brough as the
gaunt man in black who owned the iron church
round the corner!
Drovers’ Yarns.
Dear Bulletin, —In a late issue you refer
to a drover’s yarn about bullocks being drowned
in sea-foam on the Tas, West Coast as “a fair lie.”
Well, now ! During the silver-boom, I happened
to be located in the vicinity of Trial Harbour. At
the back of Fowler Bros’, store was a stable, dis-
tant from the beach about 50 yards. Early one
morning, one of the brothers repaired to the build-
ing to feed the nags. He found the place totally
smothered in foam, and had literally to fight his
way through a dense wall of it to the door. After
great difficulty, he succeeded in getting the
animals out, not without danger to himself and
them. If you are in want of a holiday, and
possess a pair of leather lungs, strong boots,
and a ditto stomach, take a tramp down
the West Coast line and satisfy yourself.
Talking of Trial Harbour in those days of mud
and famine, I remember a pack-horse committing
deliberate suicide in the waters of that lovely bay.
He was a broken-down, consumptive-looking
quadruped. He knew it was useless to run from
the scene of his troubles. In the first place, he
couldn’t go out of a walk; and, secondly, there
was nothing to eat if he got away. He had suc-
ceeded to the life-legacy of the convicts of the
grim old Port Macquarie days. So he wandered
wearily into the water, and held his head beneath
the waves until someone at the store ran down
and hoisted him out in a fainting condition. But
he had evidently resolved to quit this world for
the happy grazing-grounds where corduroy roads
exist not and pack-loads are unknown. Again he
staggered down to the sad sea waves; and this
time got too far out for help to reach him. His
poor old carcase drifted out to a buoy in the
harbour, and was caught by one of the chains.
There it remained for some weeks. Ultimately,
I suppose, the sharks fought for his hide and
bones; he had no flesh to speak of. To change
the subject. Some years ago, I carried my swag
from Deniliquin to Mossgiel (N.S.W.), and, one
day, when between the latter place and Booligal,
I fancied I descried water ahead, and pushed on
in the hope of luxuriating in a much-needed bath.
When I had traversed half-a-mile, the “water,”
which I had magnified into an extensive lake,
vanished. Of course it was nothing but a
mirage. I therefore plead guilty to the
delusion, notwithstanding that I may be
thought an idiot by your correspondent “ D.”
My ghost of a lake had the glassy appearance of
sunlit water, and looked like nothing else under
heaven. —Yours, &c.,
C. H. Read, Tas.

St. Nicholas (America) recently printed
an Australian story (serial), in which a squatter
was made to own a large cattle-station on the
Blue Mountains, so extensive in area that he had
never gone beyond the home-paddock. One day
he strayed away and got lost, and was captured by
a fierce tribe of cannibalistic blacks, who tortured
him and held him for ransom, or words to that
effect.

Sydney D.T. squeamishly finds it neces-
sary to veil delicately a criminal’s mot :—
One great English murderer explained the assassination
of a female relative on the ground that the size and shane
of her feet offended him. "
It was prisoner Wainwright who, when asked
“Whydid you poison her?” replied—“Because
her legs were so thick.” So, at any rate, said
Charles Dickens.
And do thou, friend, note the fact (where-
of you seem imperfectly apprised) that the female
who Won’t Keep Still hath character as a nuisance
of magnitude. Not one in ten of her followers
the foolish women whom by gall and glow she
enlists under her banner, has any knowledge of
her methods. They, Them Loud, meet and
approve whatever she does ; pass the resolutions
that she drafts and applaud the platitudes where-
with she titillates the ears of her; but of what the
creature is up to during the time that they are
not in session they are sweetly unaware. Com-
monly she is hoofing jt about town with a
“petition,” which men busy at their business sign
without reading, in order to have done with her—
a petition for speeding the millennium of equal
(and superior) rights ; a petition for appointment
of only angels to office,, a petition for a law for-
bidding infraction of the laws; a petition for
portable sewers and reversible telegraph poles •
or a “call’’ for a public meeting to consider the
inexpediency of sin and (incidentally) the need of
better roads ; or a demand for recognition of God
in the regulations of the public pound. Armed
with these documents, numerously and humorously
signed, she invades newspaper offices, cadging for
support and glory, and infests meetings of official
bodies to snatch at the “ reins of authority ” and
“put it there” in the “seats of power.” May
the devil take her, is the universal prayer. But
not he!— Ambrose Bierce.
Dear Bulletin, — Persons in authority,
who execute suspected criminals in compliance
with a frenzied public demand for blood, some-
times reap the reward of their actions in the sort
of harvest that almost tempts one to believe that
a just Providence has given an eye for an eye and
a tooth for a tooth. For years the idea has been
growing in the United States that when the Union
authoritieshung Mrs. Suratt for her alleged par-
ticipation in the assassination of President Lin-
coln they murdered a totally-innocent woman.
Ten minutes before her execution, on her bended
knees, she declared to her religious adviser that
she was absolutely guiltless of the crime, and the
cleric declares to this day that he knows she spoke
the truth. The big American magazines, from
the Century down, have positively refused to
publish any article tending to establish her inno-
cence ; nevertheless, as already stated, public
belief is growing in favour of that theory. All
the men who sat on the court that tried the
woman are dead save Judge-Advocate General
Holt, and every one of those men has died a
violent and terrible death—friendless, penniless
and in despair. Holt is now a hopeless beggar
about Washington. Revulsion of feeling never
fails to ensue after hasty deeds of revenge, and
our own Mount Rennie case will yet cause many a
man sleepless nights, and give fees to nerve-
specialists for treating for “neurasthenia” men
whose true ailment will be tortured conscience.—S.

“The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVENG.
With Prefatory Note hy liolf Boldrewood,
Opinions of tlxe Press s
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. ’ A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Hkeald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best’work. That they will be widely read is certain.” — SYDNEY Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen In Wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. * The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the Jink arras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquetie of conception, in which Mr, Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in * Spirit Led,’ which tho great American might have written. * A Oup of Cold Water’ is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to [purely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph
July 1.5,1893.
“‘The Last of Sixand other stories. By Ernest Favenc, (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co.) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
'and we can heartily endorse tho recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms tho third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Stab, July 15,1893.

The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil

“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy .
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comolete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap

cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System-one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the'Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to tlie fact tliat for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
