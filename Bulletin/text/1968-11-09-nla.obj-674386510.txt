Now think of your car almost immediately as
cool, as pleasant as any air-conditioned
office or restaurant. No matter how shim-
mery-hot the road, how stickily-hot the tem-
perature. You drive better, safer. You work
better, more efficiently. No sticking to seats.
No damp, crumpled clothes. No finger-burn-
ing steering wheel. Noise, heat, dust, humid-
ity are kepi outside. AND Smiths refrigerated
auto air-conditioning units keep it that way.
Why Smiths? Even easier to answer. Smiths
units are designed and made in Australia for
Australian conditions. Tested and proved
over millions of Australian driving miles.
(What may be fine on some 200 mile U.S.
freeway can’t be expected to adapt to our
multi-surface roads and clogged city traffic!)
Performance? Well, obviously, getting your
car cool quickly is the most important factor
in auto air-conditioning. And it’s here that
Smiths are a mile ahead—-with 20% faster
cooling. Two reasons. One: the refrigerated
air pours in faster—with Smiths new heavy-
duty blower assembly and side vents to make
sure you get faster cooling of those hard-to-
cool pockets around your feet. Two: Smiths
units dissipate the hot air much faster—
with bigger, exclusive condensers.
So —Hot air out faster. Cold air in faster.
20% faster. Only with Smiths.
Any more new features in the Smiths ’69
units? Certainly. The entire Smiths system—
evaporator, condenser and compressor—has
considerably greater power than any other
unit. A bigger evaporator coil of unique
design provides for an equally marked
increase of the cooling capacity inside the
car. Smiths units are light, compact and can
be installed or removed any time (unlike
non-transferable units that are built-in before
the car’s final assembly). Note, too, the posi-
tion of the controls. Designed for Australian
vehicles, they are on the driver’s side for
extra convenience and safety. And Smiths
refrigerated auto air-conditioning is quiet...
matching the cool relaxation it brings you.
The styling is exceptional—complementing
the appearance of any dash.
So why drive a hot box? It’s so easy to have
a Smiths refrigerated auto air-conditioner
installed. Write or phone any Smiths office.
We will mail you an informative brochure.
We’ll also send you the name of your nearest
dealer who’ll be glad to demonstrate for you
how Smiths 1969 refrigerated air-condition-
ing delivers 20% faster cooling.
And Smiths, world renowned for auto acces-
sories and other components (K.L.G. spark
plugs, Smiths instruments, clocks and
watches, for example), have the only truly
nation-wide network of branches, dealers
and qualified after-sales service agents.
From only $375 including tax (plus fitting).

CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE
SEMILLON GRAPE
Very similar to Clare Riesling,
although Semillon is slightly larger
and the exposed fruit does not
develop the typical copper colour.
The Semillon bunch is medium in
size, compact, conical shaped and
shouldered. Ripens early, moderate
yield, soft and juicy with fairly
thick skin. A medium, round, some
tending oval, greenish-yellow or
golden yellow grape, bronzed where
exposed to sunlight. The medium
size leaf has regular teeth and is
5 -lobed, sometimes 3-lobed.
Like a good 'dry red'?

One more week
TUNED OUT
WE ARE indebted to the London
“Observer” for this priceless exchange
overheard in a Chelsea restaurant:
American visitor to English host: “Do
you mean to say you’ve never seen
Rowan ’n Martin’s ‘Laugh In’ on TV?
It plays here on Sundays . . . you must
have seen it —you know, it has sock-it-
to-me time . .
English host: “I beg your pardon?”
American visitor: “Sock-it-tO-me,
sock-it-to-me —and then people like
Sammy Davis Jr. come on and say,
‘Here come de judge’—it’s a riot.”
English host: “We usually watch ‘The
Forsyte Saga’ on Sundays.”
KEPT OUT
CONTACT BETWEEN America and
Australia is sometimes hard to make;
the American Government has taken
one decision which widens the gulf just
a little more. Dr. Ian Turner, senior
lecturer in Australian History at
Monash University, has been refused a
visa to make a brief visit to several
East Coast universities.
Something of a popular figure in
Melbourne since it was learned that
he was preparing a serious study of
Australian Rules football, Dr. Turner
is also known nationally for his two
extended histories of radical politics,
“Industrial Labor and Politics” and
“Sydney’s Burning,” a study of the
“Wobblies.”
He has just published “The Austra-
lian Dream,” a collection of extracts,
pamphlets, and essays which draws to-
gether the hopes of past Australian
visionaries and leaders for prosperity,
freedom, and growth in this country.
The work owes nothing to a book with
a similar title, “An American Dream,”
Norman Mailer’s assessment of the
manic turmoil of the United States of
today.
Dr. Turner is also preparing a history
of the Aborigines since white settle-
ment and a collection of children’s play
songs and skipping rhymes. These pro-
jected books were part of the reason
why Dr. Turner would have liked to
visit America en route to England dur-
ing his sabbatical year of absence.
He wished to talk to the historians
of the Red Indians, and to talk to
children’s folklorists to compare notes
and extend his knowledge. The tour
would have also taken him to Anaver
in Michigan where the archives of the
IWW are kept. As a prominent historian
of Australia, the final reason for his
projected trip was to make contact with
those History Departments which were
teaching a subject known as Com-
monwealth Studies, one of the few
courses through which American
students learn something of Australia.
The American Government is be-
lieved to have rejected Dr. Turner’s
application for a visa because of his
former membership of the Communist
Party. Having been expelled a decade
ago for disagreements with the Party,
Turner now describes himself as
a “libertarian socialist.”
With the annoyance there must go
some flattery. The United States Immi-
gration Department must have a very
high regard for Dr. Turner’s persuasive
powers, or else they fear a particularly
virulent Australian version of “Yankee
Doodle Dandy.”
UNWORLDLY STIRRINGS
MORE THAN 200 people have
pledged themselves to the vegetarian
disciplines of a week of mysticism and
meditation at the first Australian Yoga
Convention at a YMCA camp near
Richmond, N.S.W., later this month.
Sydney yoga exponent Roma Blair, or
Swami Nirmalananda as she’s known
to the initiated, is the organiser of the
convention and has arranged a routine
which sounds as if it could discourage
the worldliness in anybody. The days
are to begin with a 4.30 a.m. “warning
gong,” to be followed by two more at
15- and and ten-minute intervals, in
preparation for meditation at 5 a.m.
At 5.30, there’s “breathing and relaxa-
tion,” then exercises for two hours,
breakfast at eight, a two-hour lecture
from 9.30, lunch, another lecture,
dinner, a third lecture, then bed at 9.30.
Two hundred and fourteen people are
staying at the camp, another 84 are
booked into hotels in Richmond and
Windsor — and, says Miss Blair, yoga
“is on the move in Australia.”
Several swamis will be imported for
the occasion — Swami Venkatesananda,
who was here last year (a diminutive
saffron-robed figure as solemn as the
Maharishi was ebullient); India’s fore-
most women Yogi, Ma Yagashakti; and
Swami Karunananda, a South Aus-
tralian who has lived in India for the
past 14 years. “I don’t know his Aus-
tralian name,” Miss Blair told us. “He
regards that as in his past.”
Mr. C. M. Ebert, the assistant
Director-General of the N.S.W. Educa-
tion Department, will open proceedings,
and Miss Blair said she’s working on
the possibility of having yoga taught
to children in the schools. “I’m dis-
cussing it early next year with the
Education Department.”
Meanwhile, supported by suburbia’s
women with time on their hands, private
yoga schools proliferate, and there are
32 adult evening classes at the public
schools.
Roma has been practising yoga
ever since she was released from a
Japanese prisoner-of-war camp after the
war, while a Melbourne teacher,
Margaret Segesman, went to the extent
of living in a cave in India for five years
in the cause of yoga.
Teachers get together on occasions
such as “meditation bushwalks,” and,
according to Miss Blair, they’re all
uniting now without “all the back-biting
we’ve had sometimes in the past — the
my-jchool-is-better-than-yours sort of
thing.”
TRUTH IN THE SERVICE
AMONG new releases offered for hire
by the Commonwealth 'Film Unit is a
23-minute short titled “Four in the
Service,” which is described as having
been made “in the cinema verite style
for the recruiting section of the Public
Service Board.” The thought of a veri-
table camera tracking through Public
Service corridors suggests the revelation
of all sorts of forbidden pleasures in
the tea-room, but at that it might do
more for recruiting than those columns
of prosaic classified ads which have
become the service’s contribution to
weekend reading.
LEADERSHIP HAZARDS
VIEWED in the calculating terms of a
life-insurance salesman, neither Hubert
Humphrey nor Richard Nixon are opti-
mum risks. Having survived the exhaust-
ing rigors of stumping for the American
Presidency, whichever of them gets
elected faces an immediate theoretical
reduction of his life expectancy. With
a baleful sideglance at the hazards of
national leadership, a life-insurance
office in the United States has worked
out that the average life span of Ameri-
can Presidents is 1.5 years shorter than
“might have been expected from
mortality conditions prevailing at the
time of their inauguration.”
The American statistics seem to sub-
stantiate what former Presidents Tru-

Just the way it crouches low to the ground imparts the sensation of full flight! The new Dodge Phoenix
is a car with enormous power: under control but ready for release when you say so. Even the most
hardened sceptics are amazed by its agility and instant response. That’s easily understandable, too,
when you consider the size of the V 8 engines: a 318 cu. in. 230 b.h.p. or a 383 cu. in. 270 b.h.p. But
power alone is not enough. The Dodge Phoenix is also the ultimate in luxury, softness and silence.
Words are a poor substitute for your own sense of touch and feel. And that’s reason enough to see
your nearby Chrysler Dodge Phoenix dealer. Soon!

man and Eisenhower have described as
the “growing pressures and terrifying
responsibilities” of the office. The 15
Presidents before Lincoln averaged 74.2
years — more than a year longer than
they might have expected when
inaugurated. The 16 Presidents who
died natural deaths since Lincoln have
lived to an average of only 66.6 years —
almost five years less than the average
expectancy. And when the four post-
Civil War Presidents who have been
assassinated are included in the reckon-
ing, the Presidential life span falls to
eight years below normal expectancy,
although Eisenhower (77) and Truman
(80) are doing their best to confound
the statisticians.
Leadership of Australia is apparently
less mortifying. The Australian Mutual
Provident Society’s house journal,
“Amicus” reports that 14 Australian
Prime Ministers who have died natural
deaths lived to an average of 72.1 years,
compared with an average expected
age, at their election, of 72.4 years. But
11 Australian Prime Ministers outlived
their life expectancy, and four of them
— Sir Robert Menzies (73), Sir
Arthur Fadden (73), Mr. Frank Forde
(78), and Mr. John McEwen (68, and
just remarried) are helping to improve
the average every day.
The AMP study reveals that accord-
ing to Australian mortality tables, the
present Prime Minister, Mr. John
Gorton (57), has a normal life expect-
ancy of 74.4 years.
If it is any comfort to this week’s
newly elected American President,
statistics show that the 28 Presidents
who died natural deaths lived an
average of more than half a year longer
than the 40 deceased unsuccessful
candidates.

IN THE DARK
THE ARCADIAN REVELS
REALLY GOT GOING
ARCADES ARE ALL the rage here in
Melbourne. In 1961 the Melbourne City
Council made a ruling that shops
demolished to make way for new build-
ings had to be replaced. So we are
getting these dull, low-ceilinged, space-
less, antiseptic little arcades all over
the city. They fight for custom with
little gimmicks. There was the arcade
in Elizabeth Street which tried putting
a comely blonde in a gilded cage. It
was her job to swing there daily from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Personally, your cor-
respondent does not enthuse over birds
in cages, human or otherwise.
Actually the new arcades cannot com-
pete with the grand old ones, two of
which have been in the news. One is the
Royal Arcade, which runs between
Little Collins Street and Bourke Street.
This is its centenary year. It towers like
a cathedral. It has stained-glass, lash-
ings of gold paint, mirrors, and curly
pieces of cast-iron. Down one end there
are massive figures of Gog and Magog,
which have been striking every quarter
hour since 1893. They are replicas of
figures in the Guild Hall, London.
The Royal Arcade has a B classifi-
cation from the National Trust: a
reasonably good grading, which means
“for God’s sake preserve it, as long as
we don’t have to pay for it.”
It hasn’t changed that much over the
years. When it opened in 1868, “The
Australasian” said: “It is an admirable
spot for assignations; formerly the only
place in the city was the monument to
Burke and Wills. Now the arcade will
afford a shelter as kind as a cloud of
Jupiter. It abounds in shops where
one can purchase what one doesn’t want
and affect supreme interest in the merits
of old curiosities should an unwelcome
friend pass by.” It is still excellent for
assignations and avoiding unwelcome
friends.
Keith Manzie, in a centenary booklet,
pointed out it was built in 11 months
and at the opening ceremony Mr.
Howard Spencely said the building had
been completed with such speed because
there had not been “a single case of
intoxication among the workmen during
their employment on the project.”
Nor did the Royal Arcade have a
single case of intoxication during the
centenary celebrations. They threw an
awfully nice party. Tea, lamingtons, and
cream cakes were served.
This was something of a contrast to
the re-opening of another old arcade,
the Centreway in Chapel Street,
Prahran. This also is built like a
cathedral, with a lofty magnificent nave.
The glass roof is supported by nice
bits of cast iron, and down below there
are benches to sit upon, indoor ferns,
and whatnot.
The arcade has been leased by the
D. F. Murphy cellar organisation and
restyled a la Victor Emmanuel
Gallery in Milan and called The
Gallery. If wine producers are alarmed
that foreign wines are becoming too
competitive, here’s a beaut example.
The Gallery sports special shops for
Greek wines, for Portuguese wines, for
Italian, German, Bulgarian, and the
rest. Then there are gourmet shops t that
sell only cheese, a butcher shop that has
only special gourmet cuts of meat, and
they all have arch names like Le Tabac,
Le Grec, Le Cigar, Les Livres, the Iron
Pot.
The opening was staged by the
Women’s Association of the National
Gallery to raise funds, and this time
there wasn’t a cup of tea, lamington or
cream cake in sight. The theory was that
you bought an entry card for $2.50 and
for this you received a meal and, with
a roll of tickets, you could buy Wynn’s
flagon wine for 20 cents or imported
wines of your choosing for 40 cents a
glass. To say that it was a memorable
party would be an understatement.
Tickets were issued for 1000 people
and over 1400 turned up.
Mr. Murphy had the arcade lit by

four 750-watt floodlights and a superb
bronze medieval-style lantern which
drew 2000 watts. Some say it was these,
some say it was the coffee urns, or
perhaps it was the electric guitars, but
all the power failed, just after 7 p.m.
So there we were, 1400 of us, every-
body there from Frank Thring and
Leonard Teale to Robin Boyd and Brian
Breheny, of the Carlton brewery, all
in the dark. Wives were lost im-
mediately and it was almost impossible
to find them again for the rest of the
evening. There were wine booths down
either side of the gallery, but no longer
was it easy to determine whether one
was drinking Liebfraumilch or Wynn’s,
which was dispensed from 10-gallon
plastic barrels. You did this by the
light of cigarette lighters.
The whole thing was terribly in-
formal, leather jackets, long boots,
beards, sideburns, leather minis. In the
dark it was impossible to tell one sex
from another, but even later, under the
full wattage it was not easy.
The lights came on after half an
hour, and Mrs. Elizabeth Summons,
President of 'the Women’s Association,
performed the opening by cutting a
string of sausages with a pair of garden
shears. The lights went off again and
we didn’t see a light again or wives for
one and a half hours. There weren’t
enough glasses. Your correspondent was
conducting the more delicate tastings
out of a Robert Timms’ paper coffee
cup.
Police were running up and down
stairs. In the dark one lot had to be
restrained from going off with a carton
of wine. Another lot had to be requested
not to steal off with a couple of the
pictures. There was going to be fortune-
telling, artists drawing caricatures, a
fat lady, and Miss Jennie Ham was to
be the bearded lady. Jennie thought
there was little point going bearded in
the dark so, clean shaven, she kept her
beard in her handbag.
After 9 p.m. the lights came on and
then the arcadian revels, as they were
called, really got going. Down the east
end, the group with its electric guitars
was pumping out music; beards, leather
minis, and jackets were dancing. The
rest of us, for the first time, were able
to do justice to the wines from our
Robert Timms’ cups. By midnight the
arcade was under fluid to a depth of
a quarter of an inch, a fascinating mix-
ture of Liebfraumilch, Portuguese rose,
French bordeaux, Bulgarian claret,
Greek claret, Wynn’s 10-gallon plastic
bulk, and coffee. It was not easy trying
to remove the guests. Many of them
continued to dance to the tune of God
Save the Queen.
So the gallery is really in business. It
is considered to be the greatest revival
since the old days when it sported
Copp’s Music Shop. On Friday nights
Mr. Copp would push a piano out into
the entrance, and, with Mr. Copp, jun.,
on the violin, they would play all the
latest hits. It was considered an admir-
able place for assignations.

A FASHION
SPECTACULAR THAT
REALLY WASN'T
“THIS,” said Mary Lucy, David
Jones’ Press-relations officer, “is just up
your street. ‘Spectacular’ at the Uni-
versity of N.S.W. Clothes for meditation.
I mean, how Nehru can you get? Last
year, 2000 students came, and we
thought there’ll be catcalls and things,
but there weren’t; wasn’t that wonder-
ful. But you can never tell with students,
can you? I mean, anything can happen.
Qh, it’s just up your street. I’ll be there
behind the wings with my little pile of
handouts . . .”
So everyone comes with notepads and
pencils and cameras and television para-
phernalia to see students’ reaction to
fashion. Hoping for a riot, at least. Not
actual bloodshed. Perhaps a tomato or
two. Or three. The Press motor up
Architecture Road into Science Road,
Cliccrs for bikinis, boos for swimsuits
into Physics Road, park by the School
of Metallurgy, and walk into the Round
House, where someone says the last
function here was a ball. They have
’em all the time. And after “Spectacu-
lar” there are to be meetings of the
Evangelical Union, the Underwater
Club, and, later that evening, a meeting
of the Ngunagan Club.
Miss Lucy is waving her little pile
of handouts and feeding out vital infor-
mation. “We’re showing sixty, six-tee
garments, yes, we’ve got a D.Js’ store
here, we’ve had one at Sydney Uni-
versity, the university, simply ages and
we thought it time N.S.W. had one.
Now you must meet Miss Vicki Noon,
as in midday, who worked for Myer
then designed boutiques in Cairo, and
now we’ve got her, aren’t we lucky?
And Mr. Phil Jordan, our fashion con-
troller and, incidentally, our associate
director . . Miss Noon and Mr.
Jordan dip heads in silent acknowledge-
ment “. . . and Cor de Regt, ‘Spec-
tacular’s’ choreographer, he’s a whizz at
jazz-ballet . .
Cor, christened Cornelis Jacabus, is
Dutch, beautiful, with a Greek-god face
and a Zapata moustache. He wears an
immaculate starched blue Nehru shirt
and says he met the .cast for one hour
last week. “I tell them follow me then
ad lib, then follow me then ad lib,
then follow me then ad lib, until they
hate me.”
And over there is Paul McCloude
in formal black suit and pointed shoes,
snatching a coffee before performing
on his electric organ “. . . it’s all mine,
$7OOO worth, I plugged it in this morn-
ing and had a run-through. There’s
only one thing wrong with this place
and it’s the acoustics, I sound like 20
lorries in a tunnel. If you’re putting my
name in spell it right, they never do.”
He writes it down in pencil in capital
letters. Actually, Mr. McCloude has a
pleasant life playing soporific melodies
to ladies in stores and is about to take
to the sea he hopes in the Canberra
playing his way round the world
first-class. In a dinner-jacket. That, he
says rapturously, is the life.
The students are gathering. With
sandwiches, milk shakes, fruit, and arm-
fuls of sustaining calories. They 101 l
around the black-leather chairs and are
dressed in subdued fashion. There are
more beards than beat clothes, and
more boys than girls. What’s making
the violent noise is recorded music from
above, pulsating soul numbers. On
Miss Lucy’s handout these have
been attributed to Mr. McCloude, then
crossed out. Mr. McCloude says he is
playing kind of Latin-American stuff;
2UW’s Rod Christopher emerges from
beneath technicolor cutout cardboard
flowers. “We’ve got six girls, two boys,
and Paul McCloude on his stereophonic
organ, so let’s get under way, huh?”
And Mr. McCloude—“psst.” from Miss
Lucy, “we call him Birthday Boy, he
always plays on anniversaries” —throws
himself like 20 lorries in one tunnel
into “Marie, the Dawn Is Breaking.”
Bikinis come on. Cheers. Swimtrunks
come on. Boos. One male model has a
phosphorescent anchor stuck on his arm
and a “Caution, I’m a bikini lover”
label stuck on his stomach. Cor dances
on. Everyone hisses. Miss Lucy smiles.
They did that to him last time and he
doesn’t mind a bit. Cor looks like he
could kill the lot. “I’ll tell you what,”
says a Sydney fashion writer, “he and
his wife stood in for Elizabeth Taylor
in ‘Cleopatra,’ or sump’n, that’s his
claim to fame.” She is having a frus-
trating time. She is forced, simply
forced, to cover everything D.Js’ does,
even staff competitions. It’s humiliating,
she says, and she is here today looking
for some wild, way-out fashion pictures.
But the students are disappointing her,
the clothes are disappointing her, and,
in fact, if she doesn’t get some iced

ALL THIS
AND A COMPANY
CAR, TOO
REMARKABLE numbers of advertise-
ments are published now inviting appli-
cations for highly paid and glamorous
jobs. Often the company that has the
job vacant is not named; the ad is
inserted by a firm that specialises in
finding executives for other firms. I
sometimes browse through these ads on
Saturday mornings when they are
most abundant—envying the dynamic
fellows whose talents equip them for
such lucrative posts, always with car
provided.
Recently, this one caught my eye:
GENERAL MANAGER
$20,000 plus
A major international company
engaged in the manufacture and
distribution of narcotics is seeking
a General Manager for its sub-
sidiary in Sydney. Experience in
the marketing of marihuana,
heroin, etc., would be an advan-
tage, but an appointment could be
made from outside the industry if
applicant has outstanding qualities.
This fast-growing company is
about to embark on a program of
diversification. The General
Manager will be required to super-
vise the establishment of a chain
of baccarat schools and massage
parlors. Opportunities will exist for
rapid advancement to a higher
salary level. A bullet-proof com-
pany car is provided, and there are
other fringe benefits. Applications
should be addressed to Trevor
Nimble and Associates (Pty. Ltd.),
Executive Selection Division.
The importance of the service pro-
vided by management-selection experts
is obvious here. Formerly, a company
of this kind, when looking for a General
Manager, might have promoted some
loyal but unimaginative servant of the
firm, such as the head of the morphine-
smuggling department. A specialist like
Trevor Nimble can apply a battery of
psychological tests to find a man who
has the potential to grow with the
narcotics industry.
An important pioneering venture was
made lately by this firm of executive-
selecting consultants. A satisfied client,
the managing director of a large manu-
facturing group, had been divorced. He
asked Trevor Nimble and Associates
if they would undertake the selection of
a new wife for him. The firm agreed
to do so and published the following
advertisement:
WIFE
required for well-established and
expanding industrialist.
Duties: To provide a full range
of conjugal facilities, supervise
domestic and culinary operations,
and promote the social and com-
mercial interests of the client.
Qualifications: Prepossessing
appearance, keenness, and ability
to work harmoniously with top
management are essential. Previous
marital experience is not necessary,
but applicants should be eager to
learn, and have capacity to trans-
late new policies promptly into
action.
Benefits: Liberal expenses, car
provided, interstate and overseas
travel. Dress allowance subject to
negotiation.
Age: Preferably in the 20-30
range, but a slightly older applicant
with exceptional abilities would be
considered.
Scores of applications were received,,
and the consultants sifted them by up-
to-date techniques. The girls were given
the Purdue Mechanical Adaptability
Test, the Allport Ascendance-Submis-
sion Test, the Crawford Small Parts
Dexterity Test, and the Pforzheimer
Test for Postural Discrimination. Their
social aptitudes were evaluated by the
Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament
Survey and the In-Basket Test for
Verbal Facility.
Three short-listed applicants were
sent to the client for his final selection.
He chose a beautiful brunette, Prudence
T. the top-scorer on the job-
performance expectancy chart and
they were married at once. She made a
very satisfactory wife for three months;
then she left suddenly with a company
car and a pop singer.
The consultants, though disappointed,
were not discouraged. Trevor Nimble
commented: “Procedures for wife-
selection are still in the developmental
stage, and it is hard to eliminate the
risk of wife-turnover. However, we hope
to obtain more reliable results by using
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory. This provides a searching
questionnaire on such matters as ‘Does
your mother like oysters?’ and ‘What
furniture do you own?’ It’s a case of
back to the old drawing-board.”

NEW PRESIDENT, NEW MORALITY?
Comment by ‘Observer’
FOR AT least a while after their
new President takes over, the main
concern of the Americans may be how
they can live with themselves rather
than how they are going to live with
the rest of the world. But the rest of the
world will crowd in on them, never-
theless, and the continuing debate about
what kind of a nation America is must,
of necessity, continue to be projected
into questions of how America conducts
itself in the world, as well as being
concerned with how Americans get on
with each other at home.
All nations justify their conduct
partly in moral terms, but the Americans
have a history of doing this more than
most. Part of their present crisis is a
problem in the rhetoric of morality:
in what new way can America seem
good?
The traditional isolationism was con-
fident in this answer. The world was
corrupt and evil, America was innocent
and pure. As the only true civilisation,
it served mankind best by avoiding the
contaminations of the old world, to
which it provided the only true alterna-
tive. That America also regarded Latin
America, and to some extent the Pacific
Ocean, as its own sphere of influence
and that it held a special interest in
East Asia were matters that simply
spiced its morality with that special
tension that often marks morality: one
can say one thing and do the opposite.
There were conflicting moods in the
world commitments that followed World
War 11. In the great programs of
economic aid (in particular the Marshall
Plan) and in the spirit of reform the
Americans took to Japan there was that
kind of a marriage between generous
idealism and careful self-interest that
can provide some of morality’s most
convincing victories, founded as it is
on both hope and fear. The rest of the
world became a place in which there
was at last a potential for good that
might be liberated by American action.
But the defeat of the American presi-
dential candidate in China and the in-
conclusive struggle of the Korean War
promoted a counter-strengthening of
the isolationist mood against a basically
evil world. Of this the two main symp-
toms were, at the respectable level,
Dullesism and, at the semi-criminal
level, McCarthyism.
The isolationism of the McCarthyists
was obvious enough: it represented a
return to the idea of the world as evil
and America as the only true good,
but now itself riddled with contamin-
ation from outside. The isolationism
of John Foster Dulles was less obvious.
He was a bomb-rattler and he talked
big, but he talked too big for action.
His favorite role was to lecture the
world on its evil. Not only the Russians
but also the Chinese saw America as a
paper tiger.
It was the victory of the Democrats
and of John F. Kennedy that marked a
return to the world both in the
expression of idealism and in the
readiness to take limited action and
this was, more or less, the view of the
world that President Johnson also
maintained. He was weaker or more
old-fashioned - in expressing his ideal-
ism, and events escalated his action, but
until things fell to bits the world still
seemed a place in which Americans
could do good.
Will the new President see it this
way? The shocks of an un-American
failure to achieve quick success in
Vietnam have created a crisis in
America as did the defeat of Chiang
Kai Shek and the struggle of the
Korean War, but because it has also
affected some of the internationalists it
might have even more important effects.
Among the old isolationists there are
not likely to be any more witch hunts.
The old isolationism now expresses itself
in the new talk of weaponry, as if the
world can be shut out by the nuclear
and electronics industries, and in a more
exclusive interest in Europe. (An
exclusive interest in Europe and not
only for America is one of the con-
temporary forms of parochialism.)
However, there is now also a disgust
with the world among some of the old
internationalists. Again Europe-oriented,
they see the rest of the world and
South-East Asia in particular as a
grubby kind of place, not worth the
attention of American idealism. Some
of the most emotionally effective attacks
on American action in Vietnam have
come from those critics who most
openly express their contempt for
South-East Asia. And, whether among
old isolationists or new, there is now
such a contempt for the ungrateful
natives who don’t know what to do
with the money America gives them
that whole parts of the foreign-aid pro-
grams have now disappeared. On both
left and right there is the feeling that
aid now begins at home. In its present
mood the world’s richest country, the
first to incorporate some of the tech-
nectronic society of the future, con-
templates that future with more fear
than hope.
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THE DARK?
Comment by Alan Reid
THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY
authorised the Minister for Trade, John
McEwen, to negotiate for an interest
in the British-owned Port Line of ships.
Cost to Australia of acquiring such an
interest was estimated at a possible
$4O million. McEwen is now back from
the United Kingdom. Outcome of his
negotiations with the Port Line has not
yet been disclosed.
But the negotiations and the secrecy
which surrounds them open up the
wider question of the extent to -which
voters in a democratic community are
entitled to information. There is also
the question of whether decisions of
such magnitude, which have no security
content but involve large expenditure,
should be preceded by public discussion
in which sections of the community
with a vital stake in the outcome are
given an opportunity to participate.
There must be some rationale to the
Government’s decision. Governments do
not make such major decisions—which
could have a profound effect upon
freight rates to and from Australia for
years to come and through such freight
rates upon the general economy
without some logical basis. But no such
basis has ever been explained. Questions
in the Parliament have been evaded.
No Government Department has elab-
orated the Government’s reasons. The
decision stands in isolation, unex-
plained, mysterious.
I find it of considerable interest that
a confidential report from a shipping
committee set up by the Graziers’
Association of New South Wales an
association which has a vital concern
with freight rates complains about
the secrecy maintained by McEwen’s
Trade Department on shipping matters
and advocates that responsibility for
such matters should be handed over to
what would seem the more appropriate
authority of the Department of Ship-
ping and Transport.
The graziers and other shippers are
trying to discover the basis of the Gov-
ernment’s decision. As I see it, they are
entitled to know why the Government
has decided to proceed along these
lines. They have a lot to lose if the
Government has made a miscalculation
and the long-term effect of the Gov-
ernment’s move is to add further to
Australia’s burden of freight costs.
This penchant for secrecy is a grow-
ing thing, and apparently not limited
to Australia. The British report on the
United Kingdom Civil Service, which
sat under the chairmanship of Lord
Fulton and published its findings in
June, 1968, had this to say:
“We think the administrative process


The Parmelia will open late this year.
The executive housekeeper, the chefs, the waiters,
the maids are all working now.
At the Aldelphi.
When the Parmelia opens, the Adelphi
will close. And we will change uniforms.
From the very beginning we will make
the Parmelia one of Australia’s
finest hotels.
International in every respect.
PARMELIA

is surrounded by too much secrecy. The
public interest would be better served if
there were a greater amount of open-
ness. The increasingly wide range of
problems handled by Government, and
their far-reaching effects upon the com-
munity as a whole, demands the widest
possible consultation with its different
parts and interests.
“We believe that such consultation is
not only necessary in itself but will also
improve the quality of the ultimate
decisions and increase the general
understanding of their purpose . . .
Since Government decisions affect all of
us in so many aspects of our lives, con-
sultation should be as wide as possible
and should form part of the normal
processes of decision-making. It is an
abuse of consultation when it is turned
into a belated attempt to prepare the
ground for decisions that have in reality
been taken already.”
The report draws attention to the
practice in Sweden, where, it claims,
there is wide and prolonged consulta-
tion at the formative stages of policy-
making. In addition, all files of any
administrative office (in Swedish
terminology Ministries and Agencies)
are open to the Press and the public if
not declared secret on the grounds of
military security, good international
relations, or for the protection of indi-
viduals named in them.
Adds the Fulton Report: “This shows
that open Government is possible.”
As I see it, this is a suggestion that
could be adopted in Australia. I hold
the view that subject only to the
requirements of security and a few
minor qualifications, particularly when
a decision is made, the facts and reason-
ing that provided the basis for the
decision should be made known.
To revert again to the McEwen
negotiations. Quite a few shippers are
worried about the wisdom of buying
into a British-owned shipping company
and through that shipping company
becoming a member of the Shipping
Conference that fixes freights to and
from Australia. It could be that the
Government is merely giving the status
of its presence to an organisation that,
with Government participation, could
fix higher rates with greater impunity.
But they cannot at this stage really
criticise the proposal. They have not
been consulted. They do not even
know what the Government is up to.
Parliament is not wholly effective
in extracting information from a reluc-
tant Government. A Government can
always reinforce its “no comment”
attitude with the majority it controls in
the House of Representatives, though
temporarily (as the VIP issue showed)
it cannot get away wholly with it in the
Senate, where, when Labor and Demo-
cratic Labor Parties combine, they have
a majority.
The Fulton Report suggestion that
the British Government should set up
an inquiry to make recommendations on
how to get rid of unnecessary secrecy
is one that might be worth studying in
Australia.

The Hertz Rent-A-Car
19 point check-up:
could your car pass it?
It’s our policy to check every
car 19 ways before we check
it out to you. We check the big
things like hand brake, foot
brake, clutch, steering. And
the little things like the seat
adjustment lever, the heater,
the radio. If they don’t work,
you don’t get the car. So the
car you do get, works.
We do some other things with
our cars your probably can’t
do with your own. Such as
trading them in very early in
life. And stationing them at
convenient offices throughout
Australia. And letting you pick
up a car in one city and leave
it in another.
It’s hard to beat our prices,
too. Hertz rents Fords and
other fine cars at a lower price
than any other major car
rental company in Australia.
And only Hertz has Economile
the special ‘long distance
rate that saves you money.
Your daily mileage rate can be
reduced up to 50%.
When you want a car to meet
you at the airport or any-
where else, just call Hertz
before you leave.
Hertz pre-booking means the
right car, at the right place, at
the right time. Hertz guaran-
tee it.
Back to the ‘Hertz 19 point
check-up’. If your car can't
pass it, how about renting one
from us ’til yours is fixed?
Hertz: The key to more than a car.


AUSTRALIA
How much
more pressure
on the brakes?
Treasurer McMahon .. .“There are
a number of reefs ahead”
AUSTRALIA’S ECONOMIC per-
formance over the past three years has
been a major unwritten success story.
Afflicted by droughts more severe than
any for a generation, and burdened
with the need to treble defence spend-
ing, the economy has nevertheless con-
tinued to grow strongly and steadily.
Partly by luck, partly by the good
management of hard-working Treasurer
Billy McMahon, the economy is now
set for another year of strong growth—-
probably 11 percent in money value,
seven percent in real volume—but there
are difficulties ahead which will test the
skill of Australia’s economic managers
to the full. In a series of speeches
last week the Treasurer drew attention
to them. When, after proceeding
through a discussion of health of
the economy, he w’arned that he
wouldn't want to leave the impression
that “we can afford to sit back and let
things take their natural course.”
“o,n the contrary,” he said, “there are
a number of reefs ahead and the course
of events wall have to be watched very
closely over the next few' months.”
What warms up Mr. McMahon for
the moment is the possibility of
economic overheating: “We must be
particularly on guard against the
development of excessive levels of
demand.” He described the recent
tightening in the labor market as a
“definite warning sign” and drew atten-
tion to the unemployment figures wdrich,
after almost 25 months of stability,
began to drop sharply in June, so that
unemployment is now 13 percent lower
than then —at 61,000 registered
unemployed compared to 70,000. And,
according to the Department of Labor’s
monthly surveys, record amounts of
overtime are being worked. “The
picture of a considerable tightening in
the labor market is unmistakable,” said
Mr. McMahon.
This is a product of buoyant demand
in almost everywhere in the economy.
But if any one area is to be picked out
it has been led largely by homebuilding.
September house and flat approvals, for
instance, w'ere running at an annual
rate of just on 150,000. This compares
with 120,000 the same time last year,
and little more than 100,000 not so
long ago. The boom is strongest in
Western Australia, where construction
rates have close to doubled compared
to just three or four years ago. N.S.W.,
Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria
(in that ranking) have shown sub-
stantial increases, too. Only in South
Australia does homebuilding remain
relatively depressed. And with the boom
in building houses go booms in buying
things to put in them: washing
machines, television sets, refrigerators,
bedding, and furniture.
This particular homemaking boom
seems to be more strongly based than
most previous such booms, because
people born during the highly fertile
immediate post-war years, 1946-48, are
now' starting homemaking. Having
created an education crisis by flooding
into unprepared secondary schools and
universities they have now passed out
into the workforce and are marrying
and making homes —and a crisis in
levels of demand. Since the 25- to 29-
ycar age-group is growing much faster
than any other and will be half as
large again in 1973 as now, the demand
for housing and equipment to go in
houses looks like growing strongly for
several years yet.
The Government can, of course,
clamp down on housing through the
banking system, and in fact housing
finance seems certain to become tighter
over the next ten or 18 months. But
housing policy can lose Government
votes so the Government is unlikely
to clamp down too hard.
Unfortunately, some parts of the
boom are not big enough. Minerals
developments have been keeping the
total business capital spending statistics
looking good, but they have been
obscuring a low level of investment in
manufacturing industry. Some indus-
tries—like motor vehicles, oil refining,
and chemicals—have been holding off
because they aren’t sure what plans the
Government has for them. But every-
where there is scope for more modern
equipment and the lull in manufactur-
ing investment is a pity; from the
longer-term viewpoint of economic
growth one of the principal criticisms
of the last Budget was that the choice
of company taxation as an object for
increased revenue-raising may have
damaged the long-awaited recovery of
manufacturing investment.
It would be equally damaging if
monetary policy were to be relied on
for damping the economy over the next
six or eight months. Most financial and
economic experts are of the view that
in the interests of industrial modernis-
ation, it will be better if any restraints
go on consumer and Government
spending rather than on business invest-
ment. But the difficulty for the Govern-
ment is that while monetary squeezes
hit housing and business investment,
they hardly get at consumer spending.
That can be damped only by taxation,
but mid-year Budgets, bringing in
higher taxes, are likely to be seen as
panic measures.
But how likely is it that the brakes
will have to be applied to the economy?
The first thing to be said is that there
have already been two small jabs on
the brakes: the August Budget was
tougher than expected and the Reserve
Bank had its go, too, with its rise in
overdraft rates and calls to reserves.
Combined with the knock the stock
market has taken, these measures will
contain spending to some extent.
So what’s the worry? It is the old
inflation and balance of payments
formula.
While on the inflation side, the latest
consumer-price figures show a remark-
ably modest rise of only two percent
on an annual basis; Government officials
are worried that this conceals stronger
inflationary pressures. For one thing,
the index is heavily influenced by food
prices, which have been stable, while
other consumer prices have been going
up. At the same time cost-inflation pres-
sures from recent wage cases have not


yet been reflected in passed-on prices,
but over the next 18 months they are
bound to appear. Under the pressure
of Arbitration Commission decisions,
average weekly earnings will rise by
between six and seven percent this year,
and it would require equivalent pro-
ductivity increases to contain costs.
The other thing the Government’s
advisers are looking at is the balance
of payments. At the time of the Budget,
the Government’s advisers thought that
the deficit in international trading
would be quite modest, with exports
about $3.3 billion and imports $3.4
billion. But events since then have made
them change their minds.
Because of dry conditions during the
growing season, wheat production is
going to be less than was expected in
June, and fierce international competi-
tion close to the floor price of the
International Wheat Agreement is
making it almost impossible to nego-
tiate new contracts with the Chinese.
Meanwhile, imports have surged far
ahead of the $3.4 billion figure; in the
September quarter they have already
been running close to $3.5 billion. Gov-
ernment analysts have re-worked their
estimates and now think that the import
bill will end up around $3.6 billion,
giving Australia a $3OO million trade
deficit.
This could be lessened if Esso-BHP
gets its oil quickly on stream and if
iron-ore exports keep ahead of schedule.
But the Treasurer is worried about a
spill-over of excessive demand from
local production into imports over a
wide range of products. Fortunately,
capital inflow is continuing very strong
and deficits on current account are
being almost completely covered by
them.
Looking 20 or 25 months ahead,
there are few worries about the balance
of payments because of drought re-
covery, the massive contribution of
mineral exports, and the import
replacement powers of oil and gas.
This is the third financial year in suc-
cession, however, in which reserves have
run down, and together with infla-
tionary pressures this is causing
concern.
Treasury officials are chuckling about
one possible “saver”: delays in the
F- Ills which would keep Australia’s
import bill looking very conservative.
THE DLP
FOCUS ON DEFENCE
THE DLP last week, taking over from
the Labor Party the role of Opposition,
published a critique of the Govern-
ment’s handling of the defence reassess-
ment. “Focus,” a journal published by
Federal DLP secretary Jack Kane, was
devoted entirely to defence and read
almost like a letter to the Prime
Minister.
It attempted to get around Mr.
Gorton’s complaint that the DLP was
somehow “blackmailing” the Govern-
ment on defence by pointing out that
its leadership had only limited room
for manoeuvre: “DLP voters are people
of independent mind, without any basic
sympathy for the Government Parties.
Second preferences have only been
given with great reluctance in the past.
The extreme Left-wingery of Dr. Evatt
and Mr. Calwell, and the clear danger
DLP Senators Little (1.), Gair, and
Byrne
of their irresponsible foreign policies,
was the determining factor in estab-
lishing a pattern of DLP preferences
going to the Government Parties. But
that pattern is not unchangeable.”
The article claimed that it was Mr.
Gorton himself who was increasingly
throwing doubt on the long-standing
proposition of DLP leaders that the
Liberal and Country Party Government
had a basically preferable foreign policy
to the Labor Party’s: “Whenever he
has spoken of defence policy since he
became Prime Minister, he has spoken
of it simply in terms of defending the
Australian mainland. He has questioned
the whole ‘forward defence’ posture,
shown extreme reluctance in making
even the more minimal commitments
to the defence of Malaysia and Singa-
pore, and demonstrated no enthusiasm
for developing improved regional
security arrangements in South-East
Asia and the Pacific.”
It was suggested that Mr. Gorton’s
thinking might, if carried into effect,
come to jeopardise the Australian-
American alliance because that alliance
is based increasingly on Australia
pulling its weight in the South-East
Asian region: “In Vietnam, Australia
has 750 soldiers per million of popula-
tion. America has 2700 soldiers per
million. The American taxpayer doles
out $l5O to support the war effort, the
Australian taxpayer only $5. Every
Presidential candidate in the U.S. has
said that countries which wish to benefit
by American assistance through
alliances must contribute much more.
Mr. Gorton appears to wish to con-
tribute less . . . We don’t know John
Gorton’s mind. But the signs look very
ominous.”
Claiming that many in the Liberal
Party shared its apprehensions about
the trend of Gortonian defence think-
ing, “Focus” said: “Were Mr. Gorton
to lead the Government toward Evatt-
Calwell-Cairns policies of isolationism
and national weakness, there would be
very little that the DLP could do to
save the Government. Even if it should
still want to save it.”
THE ALP
VICTORIA'S PLAN
By ALAN REID
IN AN attempt to cut down on the
nihilistic irresponsibility in which feuds
in the Labor Party reach the stage
that the participants are using their
undoubted political talents almost
exclusively for self-destruction, the Vic-
torian ALP executive is considering
working for a change in ALP Federal
rules.
As things stand at present, the
Federal ALP Executive consists of 17
people two representatives from each
of the six States, the four Federal
Parliamentary Leaders, and the
Northern Territory representative, and
it is the fact that issues can be decided
on a fine tilt in the balance between
these 17 that concerns the Victorian
Executive.
The present Federal ALP Executive
rules reduce warfare in the ALP to
the numbers game in its starkest and
most simple form. Between biennial
Federal ALP conferences, the Federal
ALP Executive is all-powerful. It can
march into and take over the ALP
machine in any State. Such interven-
tion requires those seeking the inter-
vention to have only the smallest pos-
sible majority of one. In other words,
the fate of the ALP machines in the
.two largest States, N.S.W. and Victoria,
could be decided by a combination
which excluded both of them. Theoreti-
cally it could be decided on the vote
of the Northern Territory member,
Powerful Labor parliamentarians


have been making mischief because of
the advantage given to them by this
unreal situation. Both N.S.W. and Vic-
toria have been threatened with Federal
intervention over recent months. Vic-
toria was threatened because it
understandably found it difficult to
resolve the conflict between veteran
Arthur Calwell and Dr. Jim Cairns for
the seat of Melbourne after Cairns’ seat
of Yarra disappeared in the recent
electoral redistribution, a conflict that
was only resolved when Cairns with-
drew his claim for Melbourne and
nominated for the outer suburban seat
of Lalor. N.S.W. was made the target
for Federal intervention because of a
dispute over the pre-selection for
Robertson of Mr. F. Carr, a relatively
obscure Left-winger.
Left-wing Victoria appears to be
taking a responsible stand on this loose-
ness in the ALP Federal structure which
allows for mischief-making on a sub-
stantial scale by Federal parliamen-
tarians and ALP personalities who are
now devoting themselves almost
exclusively to internal trouble-making.
Victoria, which has a genuinely
ideological basis, believes that it should
be left in a position in which it can,
on an ideological issue, cut the political
throats of the present Right-wing con-
trollers of the N.S.W. ALP. It similarly
believes that N.S.W. should be left in
a position to cut the Left-wing’s throat
if N.S.W. ever gains such an ascendancy
in the Federal ALP machine to justify
such action. But Victoria does not
regard a single vote as ascendancy. It
should be a significant and substantial
majority of the ALP that should make
such a decision, not mischief-makers
simply playing the numbers game.
The Victorian ALP justifiably com-
plains that the activities of these
mischief-makers, as demonstrated in the
Calwell-Cairns and Carr cases, are
creating unnecessary instability in the
ALP, an instability that is assisting to
erode even further Labor’s electoral
prospects.
As I understand the Victorian atti-
tude, they want N.S.W. to unite with
them to produce a situation in which,
if there have to be Labor rows, they
will have the dignity of having an
ideological basis and will not be the
outcome of personal feuds.
The Victorian idea is that the power
of the Federal Executive to intervene
in the affairs of State branches be
formalised. Instead of being able to
march, or threaten to march, into a
State branch on a one-vote majority,
the Federal rules should be amended
so that they provide that Federal inter-
vention would be permissible only if
a statutory majority, possibly two-thirds
or more of the Federal Executive,
agreed that such intervention was neces-
sary. Such a limitation upon the power
of the Federal Executive would limit
the area of operation for the mischief-
makers and require mostly an ideo-
logical basis before there could be
Federal intervention.
It is going to be interesting to see
whether the N.S.W. and Victorian
ALPs, for years at daggers drawn, can
work together, despite their conflicting
ideological outlooks, to secure what
Victoria undoubtedly views as a major
reform of the ALP Federal structure.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
ABORTION BILL
“PERSONALLY I find the idea of
abortion repugnant. I can’t explain
why. It’s emotional,” said South Aus-
tralian Attorney-General Robin Mill-
house on an Adelaide radio program
recently. The statement came at the
end of a 30-minute discussion in which
he outlined in detail the Bill he has
introduced to reform the law as it
applies to abortion in South Australia.
Basically similar to the measures
recently adopted in the United King-
dom, the Bill proposes to legalise abor-
tion when two qualified medical prac-
titioners consider it necessary for the
life or health of the mother, if the
pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,
if the mother is under 15, if there is a
clear risk that the baby would be
deformed, and if the operation takes
place in a public hospital. Mr. Mill-
house explained that the Government
was not wedded to these provisions or
a change in the law at all but that
the Bill would simply provide “a peg
to hang debate upon.”
A select committee has been formed
to hear submissions on the Bill by
interested parties and a conscience vote
will be taken. While the Bill’s final form
is not known, it does seem sure that
some changes in the law will be passed.
Apart from his personal feelings on the
matter, Mr. Millhouse said he felt that
there was a need for a change “because
a law which does not conform with the
views of the public a law that is
flouted by large numbers of the com-
munity— is a bad law.”
The move for abortion law reform
was preceeded by another liberalising
move in which the Attorney-General
played a large part. Following the
rejection of the Dunstan Bill to lower
the age of legal majority to 18, Mr.
Millhouse said that he would bring the
matter up before the next meeting of
State Attorneys-General since he felt
that such changes should be made by
all Governments at the same time. Then,
in the body of a Bill primarily dealing
with technical amendments to the
Licensing Act, he included a provision
lowering the legal drinking age to 18,
which is the kind of popular move 18-
year-olds will remember if they receive
the vote in the near future.
But abortion-law reform and 18-year-
old drinkers notwithstanding, it has been
on the matter of shorts in Parliament
that Mr. Millhouse has shown that he
is quite prepared to be as with-it as
Opposition Leader Dunstan, provided
basic philosophies do not intrude.
Following a ruling by the Speaker,
Mr. Stott, to the effect that dress in the
Chamber was governed by practice and
that retention of present standards was
desirable, Mr. Dunstan dissented on the
grounds that the Speaker was binding
members by a ruling from the chair
without authority of the House or of
Standing Orders. Not desiring to put
the matter to the vote, the Speaker
withdrew his ruling and referred the
question to the Standing Orders Com-
mittee.
Afterward, Mr. Millhouse and two
other members of the five-member com-
mittee indicated that they would support
the principle of freedom of dress for
members. Mr. Millhouse explained that
he personally could not see “anything
wrong with this type of dress, provided
Millhouse...a decent length
that it is neat and tidy and the shorts
are of a decent length.”
The following day a public, quite
fascinated by these matters of sartorial
state, saw what he probably meant by
decent while not implying indecent. It
was a South Australian political parable.
Side by side on the front page of the
“Advertiser” were Messrs. Millhouse
and Dunstan in shorts, respectively
about three careful and five racy inches
above the knees. This was keeping up
with the Dunstans in everything but the
hemline.

cost to the taxpayer of $l3OO per year
for each prisoner.) The work ranges
from building new prison blocks or
raising pigs to laundering or baking
bread.
The new policy is based on the
awareness of Mr. Maddison, the
Minister of Justice, and Mr. McGee-
chan, the new Comptroller-General of
Prisons, that almost all prisoners will
be released sooner or later the big-
gest group is the young, unmarried
males—and unless they are given some
training while they are “inside” to help
them give up crime as a way of life,
the State is wasting its time and money.
The recently retired Comptroller-
General, Mr. Morony, used to say that
Governor Macquarie had the right idea
of using N.S.W. as a giant work-release
camp. Today we need new Botany Bays.
He suggested Antarctica, or the moon.
If we can’t get them, at least we should
have more prison farms and industrialise
the prisons.
This “industrialisation,” supple-
mented by Education Department
operations in jails (including a science
laboratory in the Goulburn Training
Centre) and the new psychiatric ser-
vices, will make New South Wales
prisons among the best since prisons
were invented 200 years ago as a sub-
stitute for the hanging, branding, or
transportation of convicts.
But there is one snag. New South
Wales has 3700 prisoners and only
single cells (13ft. x 7ft.) for about 3100
of the males. This adds to the problems
of “bad company,” homosexuality, rape,
and general degradation. Mr. Maddison
recently announced his policy for the
solution of this overcrowding. The first
step is the new afforestation camp at
Newnes, in the wasteland beyond
Lithgow. This new Botany Bay has been
built by prison labor and will hold 84
prisoners. The second step is a new
prison at Cessnock with 400 cells. This
will be the first N.S.W. prison to be
built on contract ($3 million) in this
century. The third step is the takeover
of the Newington State Hospital. It will
become three prisons.
One of these will take those who
clutter up the jails by refusing to pay
maintenance to their separated wives.
Another will take the State’s 80 female
prisoners—who at the moment are kept
at the Long Bay Women’s Reformatory
for 240 prisoners—leaving about 160
cells unused. (At Newington, under the
new policy, female prisoners will be
able to watch a bit of TV, use nail-
files, and even have their hair done.)
The third will be a work-release centre
for prisoners whose terms have nearly-
ended and who need the experience of
going out to work daily and coming
“home” to the prison each night as a
preparation for the full return to normal
life. Victoria will try this too.
Newnes, Cessnock, and Newington
should remove the overcrowding of
N.S.W. prisons, but Mr. Maddison still
has two problems. The National Trust
has declared many of the Newington


Maddison...3700 prisoners
buildings to be historic, and Newington
College, the Methodist school, has
opposed the idea of using its name on
a prison.
HOBART
WREST(LING) POINT
THIS WEEK, eight months or so after
the initial announcement that Federal
Hotels Ltd. were to build a gambling
casino at Wrest Point in Hobart, Tas-
mania hats come to the surprising con-
clusion that it must hold a State-wide
referendum to decide the issue and
a Referendum Bill is under debate in
Parliament.
The key appears to be a fairly black-
white issue of materialism versus ideal-
ism: the advantages on one hand of
possible higher income from tourism,
the dangers on the other that the casino
would .mainly affect Tasmanians, lead-
ing more of the'm to gamble, while also
attracting what minority Centre Party
Leader Lyons has called “Kings Cross-
type development . . . with girl-rackets,
white slavery, and drug-peddling.”
Mr. Lyons’ view was one of the ex-
tremes of the eight months intense
public and parliamentary debate, but
most of the “fors” and “againsts” have
been emotive. One Government “rebel”
on the casino issue in Parliament, Mr.
Barnard, MLA, said there were suf-
ficient devices in the community to ex-
ploit the weaknesses of the people.
Other opponents of the idea pointed
out that the Government’s proposed
agreement with Federal Hotels would
license it to operate a casino in southern
Tasmania only, with the inference that
others might be licensed for two other
parts of the State later.
The Hobart Chamber of Commerce
and the Tasmanian Tourist Council
were the casino plan’s staunchest advo-
cates during the interim. At one point
Chamber president R. S. Valentine
issued a firm statement that “the
Chamber would consider it a major set-
back to the welfare of the business com-
munity and the Tasmanian people in
general if this opportunity to acquire a
first-class tourist attraction were denied
them.”
Tourist Council manger R. E. Clarke
suggested that opponents of the casino
plan, most of whom realised the advan-
tages of more tourists, were wrong in
believing that more attention to his-
toric and scenic attractions would
achieve that. Research had proved that
among Victorians going on holiday, for
instance, only a small fraction thought
of visiting Tasmania. Whereas if Wrest
Point had the only convention and
casino complex in the South Pacific,
the story might be very different.
With such people on his side, Federal
Hotels’ chair'man of directors Mr. C. A.
(“Big Bill”) Edwards retired to the
baseline to await service, perhaps
hardly expecting such volleys to come
over the net as eventuated from
Gamblers Anonymous, the Ministers’
Fraternal, all the opposition groups and
supporters who combined to vote
unanimously against the plan at a 900-
strong meeting in Hobart a few weeks
ago; with a final ace served by Dr.
Davies, Anglican Bishop of Tasmania,
who returned from a visit to England
with some harrowing information on
conditions which have followed legal-
ised gambling there.
Finally, last week, the parlia’mentary
debating and adjourning had to end
and Premier Reece, of Tas.mania, had
to consider putting the question.
Though it was to be a conscience vote
in the Assembly, it seemed the Gov-
ernment might either lose narrowly, or
just scrape through with a further
hurdle to be taken in the Legislative
Council. Mr. Reece suddenly decided
that it should be left to the people, and
foreshadowed this week’s Bill.
MELBOURNE
BATMAN SQUARE?
THE GROWING number of fanciful
suggestions for the lay-out of Mel-
bourne’s City Square augurs that the
final plan draws ominously near. As the
buildings come down for the $6 mil-
lion project, citizens wait for the fate-
ful blunder to be made.
At the moment, the Square is a some-
times sunny, mostly windy slope sur-
rounded by the grubby back and side
walls of buildings which, fortunately,
Ex-Lord Mayor Evans...not just
another sunshine plot
won’t be exposed for much longer.
When there is no wind, it forms a
pocket for exhaust fumes to sulk in.
It is a place for the RAAF to attempt
to drown out the traffic noises at lunch-
time, for old people to sit on comfort-
ably designed benches, and for desultory
political demonstrations.
The Square’s father, architect and
ex-Lord Mayor Sir Bernard Evans,
wants the finished article to be a “true
civic square . . . noble and serene . . .
and not just another sunshine plot.”
The overriding idea is that there be a
clear view between the Anglican
Cathedral of St. Paul’s and the stolid
grey Town Hall. As the Town Hall is
placed side on to the rear view of the
Cathedral, the emphasis placed on the
conjunction of the two buildings across
the Square’s empty space is a little
unhappy. However, as the side wall of
the Town Hall offers small delight to
the citizenry, they can ignore that and
look at the spires and stained-glass of
the Cathedral.
Shrubs, lawns, trees, and fountains
have been suggested by the nature fac-
tion: a paved courtyard, underground
restaurants and shops are favored by
the Square activists.
Only one person has proposed a
memorial to one of the men who made
the whole thing possible—John Batman.
Mr. Bernard Boles, a designer, has sug-
gested building a full-scale replica of
Batman’s chartered schooner, the
Rebecca, the ship which brought
Batman and his party of land-hungry
Tasmanians to the Yarra’s banks. The
ship, he thinks, would draw attention
to Melbourne, make it famous, and also
serve as a useful platform for ceremonial
occasions. In a real Melbourne welcome,
the Lord Mayor could be piped aboard
and then stand in his antique regalia
on the poop deck as some humorless
Asian head of State drew up in wonder-
ment below.
THE RSL
GOOD WORK, BAD NEWS
THE RSL IS a much more progres-
sive organisation than, from the news
it manages to get, you would ever
know. It works away energetically at
civil-aid projects in Vietnam, sponsors
Asian migrants, does important lobby-
ing work on behalf of tens of
thousands of needy ex-servicemen, and.
makes a practical contribution to
regional co-operation and understand-
ing by running numerous conferences
and exchange schemes. Yet by the
pronouncements of some of its high-
office bearers, and the meaningless
resolutions it carries after beery
lunches, it repeatedly brings dis-
credit on itself.
Thus newspapers had to headline
the unanimously carried resolution at
the RSL National Congress in Can-
berra last week that: “If any member
shall be guilty of conduct unbecoming
a gentleman or subversive to the


objects or policy of the League he
shall be liable to expulsion.”
Yet since the League, quite properly,
has policies on everything from
defence arrangements with Malaysia
and immigration policy to repatria-
tion benefits and Vietnam, this resolu-
tion was impossible to sustain. After
quite predictably generating a storm
of protests, it had to be withdrawn.
Similarly the National Congress
passed a resolution calling for the
expulsion of university students “con-
victed of taking part in demonstra-
tions.” In explanation, it was said
that this should apply only to people
in violent demonstrations and that the
RSL had nothing against demonstra-
tions as such.
But, of course, it is impossible to
preserve the right of peaceable demon-
stration without confining legal restric-
tions to particular acts of violence.
And it would seem grossly unfair to
most people in the community that
individuals who behaved peaceably in
RSL national president Lee (l.) with
N.S.W. president Yeo...that resolution
a demonstration, which because of the
actions of a few became violent,
should be penalised.
Much of the silliness of this
Congress must be attributed to the
N.S.W. president, Sir William Yeo,
who limelighted throughout and gave
one Press interview after another
in the closing stages of the Congress.
In the end he was disowned by the
national president, Sir Arthur Lee.
The noise of this debate almost
completely drowned out a thoughtful
submission to the Government on
future defence policy, urging the
retention of interest in South-East
Asia. It quoted Mr. Whitlam on the
need to avoid any retraction into a
fortress Australia and suggested that
the British withdrawal and increased
American reluctance to be unilaterally
involved in the problems of the region
required increased Australian initia-
tive: “The onus is clearly thrown on
nations of the area to individually and
collectively do more about regional
defence and development.” ASPAC,
it said, was “in terms of security
so.mewhat toothless, but given ti’me, a
sizable measure of goodwill, and a
determination to produce results, it
could eventually play a valuable role
in the stability of the area.”
A five-point program of defence
“fundamentals” was spelt out: “The
importance of the United States
alliance and the need to retain U.S.
interest and influence in the area to
preserve a balance of power until such
time as other nations in the area can
progressively assume this role.”
“The primary importance of Japan
and Indonesia as the countries who,
together with Australia and New
Zealand, will eventually provide power
groupings in South-East Asia.”
“The need for Australia, while taking
initiatives, to preserve her options and
leave herself room to manoeuvre in
what is, after all, an unpredictable
area.”
“The need for a greater strengthening
of defence collaboration with New
Zealand.”
“We, as a people, must recognise that
we cannot survive as a privileged
minority in an underprivileged area.
We must make the sacrifices that may
be required to make a vastly increased
contribution to the solution of
economic and social problems in the
region of which we are, for all practical
purposes, a part. This must be accepted
as the end result of all initiatives in the
international field.”
CANBERRA
THE FRASER COUP
CANBERRA CITIZENS have been
remarkably consistent Labor voters, but
last week there was a tremendous
furore when the sitting Member, Mr.
Jim Fraser, lost Labor Party endorse-
ment. The “Canberra Times” was
inundated with letters protesting against
the decision.
The reasons Mr. Fraser has done so
well in the past is that he has kept his
head down, working hard for his con-
stituents. In a city run entirely by
bureaucrats, he acted as a tireless
ombudsman. In the absence of any local
representation for the citizenry, the
Member for the A.C.T. in the Federal
Parliament has to act in this sort of
capacity. Ever since 1951, Mr. Fraser
has been elected and re-elected as a
representative of the people against the
local bureaucrats. He gained a reputa-
tion as a man who could get wrongs
righted, helping old people in trouble
with the Social Services Department,
builders refused licences, public servants
wrongfully dismissed.
But he neglected the politicking of
the Labor Party. And, according to his
opponents, was more diligent in attend-
ing meetings of the RSL. Left-wingers
in the Canberra ALP had for long
muttered their dissatisfaction with Mr.
Fraser. They wanted a man who went
through the ideological rituals of
denouncing the Americans, who was a
Cairns rather than a Whitlam man
and to hell with local sewers and social
service problems.
First they tried to get a name: Dr.
Cairns himself was approached when
he was involved in his fight with Mr.
Calwell, then Labor Senate Leader
Lionel Murphy. But neither was inter-
ested in throwing out the much-liked
and uncontroversial Mr. Fraser.
Mr. Fraser’s opponents finally chose
Mr. Gordon Walsh, a catering manager
at one of the Australian National Uni-
versity’s several student hostels. An
opponent of State Aid and a participant
in anti-Vietnam demonstrations, Mr.
Walsh may have little chance of holding
the seat for the Labor Party.
His backers in the ALP were mainly
university people. They organised
strongly in one branch, though the three
other voting branches went to Mr.
Fraser. The final vote was 56-52. How-
ever, some of Mr. Fraser’s supporters
are claiming that Mr. Walsh is not
eligible since he isn’t, as the rules
require, a member of his union. And,
in addition, some of his votes are being
challenged. Motions to set aside his
pre-selection are being sent by local
branches to the N.S.W. ALP executive,
which has the final say in the matter.
Meanwhile, the struggle is linked
with another: in Canberra’s biggest
public-service union, the Administrative
and Clerical Officers’ Association. Walsh
supporters are making a strong bid for
control against the retiring officers who
are Fraser men. In addition, the Walsh
supporters want to set up a separate
Canberra branch of the ALP completely
independent of the Right-wing ALP
executive in N.S.W., financing it by
affiliation of the union to their separate
branch.
A ten-page rules revision document
had been under discussion to establish
the autonorpous Canberra branch. One
of the proposed provisions is that
opposition to union affiliation shall be
deemed to constitute “disloyalty” to the
ALP, and grounds for expulsion. The
Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association, with virtually all public
servants as members, would be a lucra-
tive source of finance to the ALP in the
event of affiliation and would greatly
strengthen the hand of Mr. Walsh’s
supporters.
Meanwhile the Liberals, thinking that
Mr. Walsh had no chance of downing
Mr. Fraser, had difficulty finding anyone
to run for them. Their final choice, Mr.
Robert Maher, is a complete novice who
has not yet impressed. The DLP, moving
in to exploit the pro-Fraser upsurge, has
suggested he run as an Independent.
They are waiting to see whether Mr.
Maher takes a firm stand on defence
before deciding whether they can recom-
mend him for DLP preferences. In a
city of 38 percent Catholics, they have
a fair chance of making capital out of
the coup against Fraser.

INTERNATIONAL
The lonely courage of Lyndon B. Johnson
President Johnson conferred in
the White House Cabinet Room
with top military and defence
advisers before his announce-
ment on Friday halting all
bombardment of North Vietnam
— AAP-AP photo
THERE IS A tragic personal element
in the stopping of the bombing of North
Vietnam for President Johnson. If the
President had heeded the advice to
stop the bombing last January, then
being offered to him, as is now known,
even by such a sober vociferous figure
as Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine
(today the Democratic Party’s Vice-
Presidential standard-bearer), Mr. John-
son might well, last weekend, have been
on the brink of being re-elected to his
second full term in the White House
a term he could have used to vindicate
his original aspiration to go down in
history as a great domestic reformer.
There were two separate pressures
that finally brought Johnson to the
position unilateral bombing halt
without any formal undertakings in
return from the other side that he
had so long and so strenuously resisted.
The first was political, though not in
the partisan sense that cynics probably
will always believe. (The stopping of
the bombing would have given Hubert
Humphrey’s campaign a much greater
lift if Hanoi had not, apparently deliber-
ately, forced LBJ to sweat it out wait-
ing for its reply on participation by
the NLF and the Saigon regime in the
Paris peace talks almost to the eve of
election day.)
What, however, prompted Lyndon
Johnson’s original overture to Hanoi was
not so much his fears for the Demo-
cratic Party as his unhappiness about
national opinion generally. The pre-
requisite for any war even a surro-
gate one being fought 12,000 miles away
is that there must be at least some
element of popular will behind it.
Ever since the President’s own abdi-
cation announcement last March, which
served as a kind of anaesthetic for sup-
porters and critics alike, there has been
almost no sense of personal involvement
with Vietnam on the part of the broad
mass of the American electorate.
At first, it is said, Johnson could not
understand this and believed that a few
fighting speeches, such as the one he
delivered to the American Legion in
New Orleans at the beginning of Sep-
tember, would soon restore the situation
to what it had been when he was
battling for the vindication of his
policies, first against Eugene McCarthy
and then Bobby Kennedy. Only very
slowly and reluctantly did he come to
realise that the predominant popular
mood of moral and emotional dissoci-
ation from the whole Vietnam struggle
was irreversible.
But, to his credit, once he had
accepted that, he almost immediately
saw' it as his owm responsibility. His
action in withdrawing from the White
House had been intended merely to
banish bitterness: he had failed to fore-
see that it would also remove any
general public feeling of commitment
about the war at all. Johnson became
convinced that it was his fault, and
gradually determined that he must re-
solve it in the only way now available
before his successor took office. If public
identification with the men actually do-
ing the fighting in Vietnam could not
be revived, then the war itself must
somehow be wound up.
The second major factor influencing
Lyndon Johnson’s decision seems to
have been even more personal. Almost
five years ago, on the Sunday after he
THE PARIS LINE-UP
OFFICIALS OF THE Johnson Admini-
stration warned privately against
expecting an early end to the Vietnam
war as a result of the bombing halt.
They said the road ahead in the Paris
peace negotiations looked extremely
difficult. One highly placed official said
that the next round of negotiations,
with both the South Vietnamese and
the National Liberation Front par-
ticipating, might develop into an
extremely complicated diplomatic
exercise, with the opposing sides attack-
ing each other publicly and haggling
over protocol details of seating, recog-
nition, and prestige.
The Administration view, however,
was that these details were secondary
to the major question, posed colloquially
by one official as: “Can the Powers with
guns in their hands sit around a table
and make peace?”
The Communist side will press for
these goals: public recognition of the
NLF as the primary political body in
South Vietnam, complete withdrawal of
U.S. forces from South Vietnam, and
a political settlement that would lead
to a government in South Vietnam
either pro-Communist or neutral.
On the other side, the U.S. will seek
recognition of the Saigon Government
as the legal representatives of the South
Vietnamese people, withdrawal of
North Vietnamese forces from South
Vietnamese territory to be matched by
an Allied withdrawal, and a govern-
ment in South Vietnam either pro-
Western or neutral with its neutrality
guaranteed by international agreements.
Administration officials also expressed
gratification over the Russian attitude.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk had met
at least five times during the past three
weeks of intensive diplomatic activity
with Soviet Ambassador to Washington
Anatoly Dobrynin. It was presumed that
Moscow used its influence in getting
Hanoi to agree to conditions which led
to the bombing halt, and it was hoped
the Russians would play an active part
in future talks and help organise a
major international meeting to ratify
some agreement on the status of South
Vietnam.


took office, he found himself faced at
his very first policy meeting on the
war by a united array of advice in
favor of committing American power
in a major way to the Vietnam struggle.
With one exception all those present
were President Kennedy’s former top
advisers and the two who took the lead
in urging the new President that he
now had no alternative but to intervene
massively were Robert McNamara and
McGeorge Bundy.
Johnson could certainly be forgiven
if today he occasionally thinks back
wryly on that experience for
McNamara and Bundy are today per-
haps only the most celebrated examples
of Washington’s ever-lengthening pro-
cession of refugees on the Vietnam issue,
those who have long since abandoned
the kingdom of certainty for the land of
doubt. Did the number of those who,
in his own phrase, “Fell by the way-
side” ever seriously alarm LBJ? For a
long time it seemed not, but it is now
clear that one at least did.
When the President appointed Clark
Clifford, his own old friend from new-
deal days, to replace McNamara as
Secretary of Defence last January, he
plainly hoped that at long last he had
found someone to reassure him that his
policy was right, his record on the
war completely sound.
But then something very strange
happened. Clifford, who throughout
1965-67 had been a leading exponent
of a hard-line policy, changed his mind.
It was a bad blow to Johnson’s morale,
for a time he seems to have actively
resented Clifford’s “betrayal.”
But as the summer wore on —and the
Paris talks got nowhere it ceased
simply to be a case just of Clark
Clifford. Everywhere in the emperor’s
court there seemed to be deserters and
defectors. Men like Ambassador Arthur
Goldberg would leave the Administra-
tion and proceed to announce almost
the next day that they had always be-
lieved that the bombing should be
stopped, others like Averell Harriman,
the President’s representative in Paris,
began to hint at their frustrations to
favored friends in the Press. Finally
even Hubert Humphrey, whom John-
son has always believed with some
justice he created as a politician, came
out with what sounded like a statement
of lese majeste: “As President, I would
stop the bombing.”
Finally, the man who at one time had
caustically announced whenever his
former aide, Bill Moyers, came into a
room, “Here comes Mr. ‘Stop-the-
Bombing,’ ” seemed to begin to have
doubts himself. A request from Harri-
man to be authorised to make a bomb-
ing halt offer to Hanoi, which was
turned down last July, was finally
granted to Cyrus Vance, Harriman’s
deputy, when he arrived in Washington
to plead for it at the end of September.
By then, of course, the shadows were
lengthening over Johnson’s reign he
was being rebuffed by Congress over his
appointments to the Supreme Court,
repudiated by Party leaders across the
land, even rather pointedly rejected as
a campaigner by his own protege,
Hubert Humphrey. The temptation at
such a time to be intransigent, if not
defiant, must have been strong. But it
was nonetheless precisely then that this
curious, complex, byzantine figure
finally took the decision that would
have been relatively painless only 12
months ago but now only too clearly
required a form of stoic courage.
THE PEACE TALKS
A LONG WAY FROM '65
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE the
Americans possessed in Vietnam was
the fact that they did not need, and
never needed, to win this war in the
way most people use that word. Their
necessary objectives did not include the
occupation of North Vietnam, or a
change of regime in Hanoi, or even the
wholesale destruction or flight of the
mixture of southern guerillas and North
Vietnamese conscripts who made up
their enemy’s army. It was the North
Vietnamese, and the Communists in
the south, who could not have won
unless they achieved that sort of thing
the other way round. For the Americans
it was enough to prevent them. The
Americans can win the war, in the
sense that matters to them, if the final
ceasefire leaves South Vietnam with a
government of virtually any shape or
color except a Marxist one that has
seized power without having demon-
strated that a majority of South Viet-
namese want it.
There is a danger, as the negotiators
in Paris struggle through the tangle of
problems in the search for a break-
through, that people will forget where
the wood lies among all those trees,
now that the Paris talks have reached
a moment of decision. In stopping
the bombing, President Johnson had to
make a choice between a risky com-
promise and a continuation of the
fighting.
Now he has chosen the compromise,
and when the negotiations get down to
the guts of the matter, it is important
that he should remember why he is in
Vietnam at all. It is worth recalling,
once again, the reasons for the Ameri-
cans’ intervention in 1965. Their main
aim was not to preserve the status quo
,in Vietnam itself. President Ho Chi
Minh could have been allowed to put
his men into power in Saigon, and then
absorb southern Vietnam into his own
Communist State, if that would have
been the end of the matter. It would
have meant death for a large number
of South Vietnamese just as it did in
North Vietnam between 1954 and 1956.
But it might have been cold-bloodedly
possible to say that no important
Western interests were affected if the
Communists’ war-aims had stopped
there. The trouble was that General
Giap and Marshal Lin Piao were say-
ing that, for both North Vietnam and
China, the Vietnam War was a test of
what could be done in other countries;
and their point was rammed home by
the fact that five insurrections in other
South-East Asian countries were being
helped by one or the other of them.
The Americans took the point. If a
stable dividing line was to be drawn
anywhere between Communist and non-
Communist Asia, which would give the
area as much of a chance of peace as
the dividing line in Europe has given
the Europeans since 1945, it would
have to be drawn in Vietnam.
The situation in southern Asia has
changed in several important ways
since 1965. China has temporarily taken
itself out of the world by its cultural
revolution. Indonesia has pulled itself
back from the brink of a Communist
coup d’etat. North Vietnam has been
so battered by the war that it has fewer
resources to spare for revolutionary
expansion. No doubt these things make
it harder than it would have been in
1965 for Asia’s Communists to exploit
a victory in Vietnam. But they have
given no reason to think they would not
try to. And the effect of an American
capitulation in Vietnam on the thinking
of politicians all over the region would
be immeasurably greater now than it
would have been when the American
commitment to Vietnam was a matter
of a few thousand advisers. On
balance, the judgment must be that
Hanoi’s chief peace negotiator, Xuan
Thuy, with French Foreign Minister
Michel Dehre in Paris at the weekend
Vietnam remains the swing-point of
South-East Asia. As Saigon goes, so go
Vientiane and Pnom Penh and, a little
later, quite possibly Bangkok and other
capitals, too. Things may have a dif-
ferent look by 1975, if Chairman Mao
and President Ho are succeeded by
men who put their own countries’
economic development above the mis-
sionary urge. But until the succession
to Mao and Ho has actually happened
it will be a mistake to treat Vietnam
as a special case unrelated to the fate
of the rest of Asia.
What this means for the negotiators
in Paris is plain enough. If the aim


of the bargaining is to reach agreement
on some sort of non-Marxist govern-
ment for South Vietnam which does
not mean just the present Government
it is necessary to make sure that
what starts out non-Communist in
1969 is still that way in 1975 and has
not been violently up-ended in between.
It is no part of any conceivable Ameri-
can President’s policy to put Saigon
in the way of becoming another
Prague. The Americans have little or
no room for manoeuvre on this point.
But, short of putting the local Com-
munists in a position to do what Mr.
Gottwald did in 1948, the Americans
do have quite a lot of room for man-
oeuvre about the shape of the post-war
Government in Saigon. This is the
advantage of the fact that their aim in
this war is a strictly limited one. A
limited war is hell for the soldiers. It is
not exactly easy for the diplomats, who
have to cope with politicians in Saigon
who have their own position to defend.
But it does mean that the purpose for
which the United States went into Viet-
nam can be accomplished on terms that
mean less than an across-the-board de-
feat for the Communists, and that the
Communists therefore have an interest
in negotiating.
It is even open to the Americans to
contemplate the possibility of the Com-
munists getting themselves legally voted
into power at some time in the 19705.
This is where the Americans are differ-
ent from the Russians. The Russians
said, in “Pravda” on September 26, that
they would not allow a Communist
country to leave the Communist system,
presumably even if a majority of its
people said they wanted to. In fact, it is
pretty unlikely that the Communists
can command the support of anything
like a majority of South Vietnamese
for a policy of running South Vietnam
the way North Vietnam is run. A great
many people in South Vietnam want
the war to end. A lot of them have
been dissatisfied with the governments
they have had since the late 19505.
There are relatively few who, knowing
what happened in the north after 1954,
would deliberately choose a Marxist
system of government for themselves.
The Americans can probably afford to
take the risk, provided the Communists
are not running the election machinery
and the army and the police. The risk
will grow smaller in the 1970 s if the
Governments of China and North Viet-
nam pass into the hands of relatively
moderate men. It is one mark of the
superiority of the Western system over
the Communist one that it allows the
governed a substantial element of
choice, even on fundamentals. It is a
superiority that the Americans need
not be afraid to give rein to in the
South-East Asia of the 19705.
There are the makings of a political
system in South Vietnam that can offer
its population a higher standard of life,
and a freer one, than anything the
Communists can offer. The hard-nosed
men around Vice-President Ky have
been dismissed, or demoted, or shunted
to one side. President Thieu and his
new Prime Minister, Mr. Huong, per-
haps with the support of the recently
returned General Minh, make up the
first Government since the early days
of President Diem that can claim a
reasonably broad base of genuine
popular support. They can afford to
show more self-confidence than they
are letting themselves show at the
moment. They can probably even
afford to give the Communists a pre-
cisely defined place in the country.
With the end of the fighting, and
the aid that would then pour in from
a relieved America, South Vietnam in
the 1970 s would beyond much doubt
join the chain of other economic success
stories Hong Kong, Taiwan, South
Korea, and Singapore that have
sprung up on the eastern seaboard of
Asia in the 19605. They all happen to
be pluralist, that is non-Marxist,
economies. And a successful pluralist
economy is the only basis the world
has yet discovered for a successful
pluralist political life: that is, for
democracy. The problem is to de-
fine the place allotted to the Com-
munists in a peace settlement so that
they cannot, while this is going on,
haul Vietnam back into the dead end
of a Marxist dictatorship. If the Ameri-
cans can manage that they will have
accomplished what they set out to do.
S.-E. ASIA
NERVOUS NEIGHBORS
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
THIS WEEK’S favorite South-East
Asian guessing game is: who is playing
politics more—Johnson or Hanoi?
In Paris this week the Americans
sit down with the representatives of
those they have been fighting against
but not with those they have been
ostensibly fighting for. The very day
before the bombing halt President Thieu
clearly indicated his conviction that “as
long as Hanoi continues to remain
stubborn we cannot decide to halt the
bombing” and hoped the United States
would never unilaterally halt the bomb-
ing without South Vietnamese approval.
Having left himself little room for
manoeuvre, it was perhaps inevitable
that Thieu told the South Vietnamese
Parliament on Saturday that the talks
would not be attended by South Viet-
nam. Some informed observers thought
he would not go that far but would
content himself with stressing that
South Vietnam would be no more
bound by what emerged from Paris
than they were by the 1954 Geneva
Accords—never signed by Saigon.
No doubt, too, the pressures of
reality will be such as to swing Thieu
round to another position eventually.
Even as politically he cannot afford to
attend, so also he cannot afford to have
the war ended behind Saigon’s back. To
attend may threaten a coup while to
abstain may bring out the Buddhist
demonstrators.
For Hanoi, the contradiction is
between domestic and international
political reality. At home, as last week-
end’s propaganda indicated, they can
afford to continue obdurate, but too
much obduracy may be counter-
productive abroad. Having won the
crucial point American abandon-
ment of a willingness to persist in
creating a South Korea in South
Vietnam Hanoi could afford to go
easy. Any settlement which gives the
National Liberation Front a voice had
been what the allies were fighting to
Skyhawk fighter-bombers aboard the
attack carrier USS Intrepid being
loaded with 750lb. bombs for North
Vietnam last week before the bombing
halt
prevent. But Hanoi may not see this
and, true to the Communist bargaining
technique, may up the ante, thus
jeopardising the gains so far made.
After all, had Hanoi moderated its
demands much earlier it could very
probably have realised its objective of a
unified Vietnam much sooner.
All of which was in the Malaysian
Prime Minister’s mind when reacting
to the Friday announcement from
Washington. The Tunku remembered
the Baling talks at the end of the
Malayan Emergency when, even in
defeat, the Malayan Communist Party
leader, Chin Peng, yet demanded politi-
cal recognition as his price for abandon-
ing the struggle. Obviously the Tunku
did not expect Hanoi to l}e any more
adaptable, and so he made the unlikely
but nonetheless interesting suggestion
that what would be required to bring
reconciliation out of the irreconcilable
would be a further partition of Viet-
nam. The end may be unacceptable, but
his reasons for suggesting it are not.
Meanwhile, other South-East Asian
reactions were conspicuously reserved,
with the Thais barely concealing their
distaste. A couple of months ago
Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman
stressed that Thailand could never
agree to the formation of a coalition
government and that the war would
only end when “Hanoi gave up.”
By contrast, Singapore’s reaction
from Foreign Minister Rajaratnam
expressed the hope that the war would
be soon ended, so that the Americans
could concentrate on the more


important and enduring South-East
Asian problems.
More interesting still, radio reports
late on Sunday had neutralist Cam-
bodian leader Prince Sihanouk actually
expressing the hope that the Americans
would not leave South-East Asia once
the war was over but would retain
their counterweight presence in Thai-
land and the Philippines.
Sihanouk is often misquoted, but, even
allowing for that on this occasion, his
and other views conceal the fear that
the Americans are calling a halt to
much else besides just the bombing.
The present development is not so un-
acceptable as it would have been if it
had been agreed after only a couple of
weeks in Paris. Still it is felt that the
United States is conceding much more
than it is conserving.
In extremis, the fear that the war
will end when the United States gives
up rather than vice versa.
A continuing stubbornness would seem
necessary on the Americans’ part. Good
international politics require that they,
too, persist with the political struggle,
many of the difficulties of which are
admittedly of their own making. One
can hope that domestic criteria will not
be the main determinent of what hap-
pens “on the other side of the world,”
while fearing that (as in Britain’s case)
this is asking too much.
ESPIONAGE
WHO KILLED HERMANN?
NATO IS CONDUCTING a far-rang-
ing “damage assessment” of its whole
military posture following the epidemic
of violent deaths among senior German
and other allied officers in the past
three weeks.
The spy scare sweeping Germany,
Italy, NATO headquarters in Brussels,
and (outside NATO) Austria can now
be clearly linked to a Warsaw Pact
“spying offensive” before, during, and
after the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In
pressing their intelligence networks for
urgent answers to questions about
NATO reactions the Soviet spymasters
may have driven their agents to take
undue risks.
By far the most important case is
that of Rear-Admiral Hermann Luedke,
aged 57, Deputy Chief of Logistics at
SHAPE, NATO’s Supreme Military
Headquarters in Europe, who was
found shot dead on October 8. It is
now known that Luedke was responsible
for, and had regular access to, all
NATO tactical nuclear weapon depots,
ammunition, fuel, and arms dumps, and
port, railway, and other logistical re-
sources that would back up the tallied
forces in war.
If Luedke was a Soviet spy—and this
is the supposition that NATO investi-
gators are working on—NATO’s 16,000
tactical nuclear warheads would have
to be relocated, for a start. But the
gravest question which the damage
assessment inquiry must settle is
NATO head-
quarter in Brus-
sels on which a
major spy
scandal is
centred
whether Luedke could have given away
details of NATO’s “strike plan” the
overall contingency plan against a
Soviet attack on the West.
Witnesses, or reports, have already
been called in from every major estab-
lishment visited by Luedke, in his
official capacity, over the past two years.
This evidence will form part of a
“cosmic” (highest level) report to be
presented to NATO Ministers when
they meet in Brussels on November
14-16.
The other big question is did Luedke
shoot himself or was he murdered?
Although suicide was first suspected,
most experts now believe that he was
shot from behind. A bullet from his
Mauser hunting rifle entered his body
at the base of the spine, and travelling
diagonally upward blew a large hole
in his chest. Such a wound, in the
opinion of experts, could hardly have
been self-inflicted.
But who killed Luedke, and why, re-
main a mystery. The only clue to
Luedke’s possible spying activities was
the discovery, by a Bonn photographic
shop, of nine pictures of secret NATO
documents on a Minox micro-camera
film handed in for development. No-
body at the shop remembers who handed
in the film, which also contained holi-
day snaps of Luedke’s family and of his
car, prominently showing the registra-
tion number.
The difficulty of believing that
Luedke, himself, would knowingly have
handed in a film of secret documents
to a commercial photographer has led
to two theories. The first is that the
“secret” pictures were taken by some-
body else. In other words, Luedke, an
innocent man, was “framed” and may
then have been murdered by enemy
agents in an attempt to sow suspicion
and create havoc in Western defence
circles.
The second theory springs from the
fact that Luedke, known to his brother
officers as a keen amateur photog-
rapher, was allowed —against all the
rules—to take a Minox camera into his
office. It is now thought that he may
have had two such cameras, one for
personal snaps, the other for espionage,
and that he may have got them
muddled.
Grave as it is, the Luedke case would
not have caused such public alarm had
it not seemed part of a pattern of
other violent deaths and espionage.
Nahit Imre, aged 52, a Turkish official

Major-General Horst Wendland, aged
57, Acting Deputy Chief of West Ger-

Security Chief at the German Ministry

self on October 18. Dr. Hans Heinrich
Schenck, aged 40, a high official of
the West German Economics Ministry,
hanged himself at home in Cologne
on October 14.
Fraulein Edeltraut Grapentin,

Service, died of an overdose of sleeping
pills on October 15, Gerhard Boehm,
aged 63, a Defence Ministry official,
disappeared on October 18, and' was
found drowned near Bonn last

In addition, there have been the
recent deaths, outside Germany, of a
former Italian Air Minister, General
Renato Sandalli, who committed
suicide, and, in Belgium, of the Polish-

German counter-intelligence sources
advance numerous theories to explain
away nearly all these deaths ner-

professional frustration, and, in the
case of Lieut-Col. Grimm, the mistaken
fear of cancer. Most observers find some
of these theories disingenuous an
evident attempt by the security services
to cover up a major scandal.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
THE POLITICS OF TV
THIS YEAR’S PRESIDENTIAL cam-
paign may be the last conducted under
the traditional two-Party system, an
American political expert argued last
week. Television, which has already had
profound effects on American politics,
is not only making the two-Party sys-
tem irrelevant, it is producing a new
political coalition and new systems of
campaign communications, according
to Harvey Wheeler, a Fellow at the
Centre for the Study of Democratic
Institutions in Santa Barbara, Cali-
fornia.
Mass newspapers led to the develop-
ment of the two-Party system, Wheeler
pointed out. But the system began to
break down with the advent of tele-
vision. The 1952 Eisenhower election
campaign was the first true TV cam-
paign. The General was not a politician,
but Madison Avenue techniques were
John Kennedy...died of his own
creation
devised to project the desired “image.”
His campaign cut across traditional
Party lines to orient itself about the
personality of the candidate rather than
the machine or the Party. This was
the wave of the future. Television truly
nationalised campaign communications
and undermined the federal structure
of the old machines. Party politics gave
way to personality politics.
Then came the Kennedys, John and
Robert, -\vho used vast sums of money,
clever exploitation of television, cadres
of advance men, and the most sophisti-
cated personality-projection techniques
of Madison Avenue. This polarised the
TV audience violently pro and con, and
conceivably “the Kennedys may have
died at the hands of their own
creation.”
The Democratic and Republican con-
ventions of 1968 were displayed on
TV as relics of the past, Wheeler said.
A new system of campaign communi-
cations will replace the old. Senator
Robert Kennedy had perceived its
chief components. The Kennedy coal-
ition, ended by his assassination, was
composed of: 1, residual elements of
the Democratic faithful; 2, the poor
and the Negroes; 3, the functionaries
of the newer service trades, largely
white-collar workers; 4, the young and,
5, the intellectuals.
In this new coalition, “Flying cadres
of media experts will replace local
bosses, personality politics will replace
Party politics, the two-Party system will
give way to a non-Party electoral sys-
tem, and domestic issues will make way
for world issues.”
THE PILL —BAD MEDICINE
A SIGNIFICANT ADDITION to the
recurring warnings about the Pill came
last week from Dr. Louis Lasagna, a
Professor of Medicine at Johns Hop-
kins University Medical School, who
said not only was oral contraception
often dangerous in its side effects but it
was, in fact, inferior to traditional
mechanical birth control devices for
many women.
Dr. Lasagna, who is also consultant
to the National Institutes of Health,
said in a new book titled “Life, Death,
and the Doctor,” that among the Pill’s
drawbacks were increased weight, acne,
nausea, vomiting, breakthrough bleed-
ing, mental depression, excruciating
migraine headache, tension, loss or
excessive growth of body hair, skin
pigmentation, and pelvic pains.
“Most frightening of all,” he wrote,
“has been the occurrence of clotting
within the blood vessels.” In 1961, fatal
pulmonary embolism occurred in two
Los Angeles women who had been on
oral contraceptives. Next, women on
the Pill were observed to develop
thrombophlebitis (blockage of blood
vessels in the extremities) as well as
clots that travelled to the lungs. Since
then, all sorts of clotting troubles have
been reported thrombosis of the
major arteries in the arm and leg, re-
quiring amputation, as well as strokes
in a 23-year-old airline stewardess and
a 26-year-old housewife. A young
Englishwoman died of a clot in her
vertebral artery following paralysis of
all four extremities. In Ireland, a 25-
year-old patient died of a large dead
area in her brain caused by a clot in
the carotid artery. The Pill sometimes
affected the heart, by plugging coronary
arteries with clots of various sizes.
Dr. Lasagna ■ cited other medical
authorities who have warned against the
dangers of side effects, notably Dr. Erik
Ask-Upmark, head of the Department
of Medicine at the University of
Uppsala in Sweden. Reviewing his own
and other Swedish doctors’ experiences
with thromboembolism in women on
oral contraceptives, Dr. Ask-Upmark
stated: “If any female member of my
family applied to me to get oral contra-
ceptives I would most certainly not dare
give them to her.”
The possibility of breast cancer and
other forms of cancer developing from
prolonged exposure to estrogen in the
Pill was emphasised by Dr. Roy Hertz,
of the National Institutes of Health, an
endocrinologist and cancer specialist,
who filed a minority report on the
subject to the 1966 Food and Drug
Administration Committee.
Psychiatrists have been alarmed by
the unpredictable mental side effects of
the Pill. These include frigidity, depres-
sion, including crying spells or suicidal
tendencies, and aggravation of existing
melancholia.
“The Pill cannot possibly be con-
sidered the contraceptive technique of
first choice for all women,” Dr. Lasagna
concluded. “It is indicated for those
who cannot or will not use mechanical
devices because of anatomic, psycho-
logical, or religious reasons. Since it is
my firm conviction that the pill can
kill —rarely, to be sure —and that other
techniques which do not kill are almost
as effective, I believe it bad medical
practice not to recommend mechanical
contraception to those who can use it.”
GENERAL PHOBIA
WHEN General Curtis Le May,
Governor George Wallace’s running
mate, was interviewed in depth by a
team of reporters from the “New York
Times” last week he made four main
points:
1. He would forbid known Commu-
nists to teach in universities or work in
industry. 2. He is not impressed by
alleged divisions within the Communist
camp, because he sees no basic difference
between the liberalising forces and hard-
line forces. 3. He does not favor treaties
to check the spread of nuclear weapons
and halt atomic testing in the atmos-
phere. 4. He does not think much of
Curtis Le May...at war with
Communism
attempts at “bridge building” with the
Russians through cultural ties.
Regarding the Czechoslovak
General Le May commented, “I don’t
believe that there are good Communists
and bad Communists. They are just
Communists, and they all have the same
basic principles involved, which I think
are basically wrong.”
Maintaining American strength was
“a lot better than building these
bridges to people who definitely tell us
every time they get a chance that they
will bury us.”
The portly, cigar-smoking General
recalled talking to a professor from Yale

University who said he saw no evil in
Communism, notwithstanding “the
minimum figure of 20 million Chinese
executed when they took over China.”
With that kind of thinking in the uni-
versities, Le May added, “no wonder
we are having the trouble we are with
our youngsters.”
The country was “at war with Com-
munism whether you want to be or
not,” he contended. Regarding Vietnam,
a “Communist-inspired minority in
America has created such a stir about
the war that Hanoi thinks they will
win the war in Washington just as they
won with the French in Paris.”
Le May deplored what he said was
a “drift toward Socialism” through the
world, “a loss of our freedoms coming
about that I spent all my life fighting
for.” He pointed to England as an
example. “Look at our ally England and
what Socialism has done there I don’t

TIME TO COOL IT
FEW AMERICAN BISHOPS support
the “hard line” on birth control taketi
by Patrick Cardinal O’Boyle, of Wash-
ington, who harshly disciplined 40
priests in his diocese because they form-
ally dissented from Pope Paul’s encyc-
lical of human life.
The 260 American bishops, who hold
their semi-annual meeting this week in
Washington, have endorsed the encycli-
cal itself, but only a few have publicly
supported Cardinal O’Boyle’s actions in
suspending dissenting priests from their
duties, in part or full. Most bishops
seemed to disapprove of Cardinal
Cardinal O’Boyle ... his Bishops
disagree
O’Boyle’s attitude, because it served to
polarise the controversial issue. There
was at the same tirhe considerable
disapproval of the behaviour of the
priests in the Washington Diocese and
their willingness to publicise the conflict.
Most bishops gathered in Washing-
ton for the meeting doubted that they
would vote to support Cardinal
O’Boyle. “They did not want the
national body to subscribe to such
tactics,” one bishop commented, “be-
cause they fear it could exacerbate the
situation in their own dioceses.”
Another said, “There is a strong feeling
among the hierarchy that it is time to
‘cool it,’ and that’s why a majority
oppose the Cardinal’s tactics.”
However, one influential prelate con-
tended that Cardinal O’Boyle had
recognised that his dispute went beyond
the issue of birth control to funda-
mental questions of authority and how
the Church defined its teachings.
“The dissenting priests have not been
candid about the real issues at stake,”
this prelate said. “They claim they are
talking about birth control, but actu-
ally they are simply using the encycli-
cal as a wedge to attack far more
basic principles.” The prelate, whose
views are not widely shared, expressed
confidence that if a resolution were pre-
sented to the bishops in its broad con-
text as a challenge to the traditional
teaching authority of the Church
the Cardinal would win wide support
of his peers.
Few members of the Catholic hier-
archy have faced as much organised
opposition as Cardinal O’Boyle, but
those with potentially explosive ele-
ments of dissent within their dioceses
have been careful to avoid the kind of
showdown that occurred in Washington.
BLACK HISTORY
CORNELL UNIVERSITY is the first
major American university to seek out
leading Negro scholars to teach in an
Afro-American studies program. This
reflects the rise of black consciousness
among the Negro population, particu-
larly the better-educated class. The
slogan “black is beautiful” expresses
the new mood of American Negroes,
who once went to varying lengths to
disguise, minimise, or forget their color.
Partly in response to the murder of
the Reverend Martin Luther King,
Negro students at Cornell began push-
ing last April for an Afro-American cur-
riculum. They conducted summer work-
shops, consulted various foundations
and scholars throughout the country,
and by August they presented the
administrators of Cornell with a detailed
plan for Afro-American studies. The
University quickly endorsed the idea
and put aside $500,000 to implement
the pioneer course of studies. With the
start of the' 1969-70 university year,
Cornell will have, possibly, eight black
professors teaching social science, as
well as black history, art, literature, and
music in different departments of the
University.
Black students at Cornell are divided
as to whether their main objective
should be to develop a black intellectual
class, or to develop skills that will aid
them as activists in the Negro ghetto.
About 250, or one percent, of Cornell
students are so-called “disadvantaged
blacks” from ghetto communities. “The
blacks have many divisions here,” a
white professor noted, “but what holds
them together and forges a real com-
munity is the common confusion and/
or guilt about being here at Cornell
while their brothers are back in the
ghetto.”


Politics in Japan-going
with the mainstream
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
SOME JAPANESE wittily, if a trifle
regretfully, concede that, despite their
best efforts to emulate the West politi-
cally as well as economically, they have
only been able, so far, to create a
“one-and-a-half-Party system.” Given
the current disputations between the
factions of the Japanese Socialist Party,
consequent upon the Party’s bad show-
ing in the House of Councillors election
this year, and given the slowly increas-
ing importance of the Clean Govern-
ment Party (Komeito), the Democratic
Socialist Party, and the Japanese
Communist Party, and it would seem
more accurate to refer to Japanese
politics as a one-and-four-quarters-Party
system.
But in politics it is only one against
one that makes two, and in the con-
tinuing Japanese absence of that other
“one,” it is inevitable that the looming
election for the presidency of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party assumes
almost as much importance as that of a
general election.
For with the Presidency goes the
Prime Ministership. After the Liberal
and Democratic Parties merged in the
mid-’fifties, and when the first LDP
Premier and Party President, Hatoyama,
retired in December, 1956, it was found
impossible for him to nominate his
successor for Party approval. Theoreti-
cally, of course, as in other parliamen-
tary democracies, the Diet selects the
leader, but in practice the task devolves
on the majority Party, which so far
has always been the LDP. Since there
is no end to the LDP reign in sight,
hence the vigor with which the Party
presidential election is fought.
So far, no LDP leader has had more
than two consecutive terms as Party
president—though before the precedent
was set for this selective device, Shigeru
Yoshida formed no less than five
Cabinets in the immediate post-war
years. So what gives the current election
additional interest is the fact that Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato is going for an
unprecedented third term. The date of
the Party vote has not yet been final-
ised, but November 27 or thereabouts
looks the likely time.
Every LDP Diet member—that is,
both the House of Representatives and
the House of Councillors —will have one
vote together with 46 prefectural rep-
resentatives. There has been talk of
further including LDP city mayors and
prefectural governors, but this has been
resisted, so that the meeting still
resembles a Party caucus rather than a
Party political convention, despite being
called such.
But this is not to say that it will be
held quietly, quickly, and smoothly.
While a fair proportion of Japanese
are firmly convinced that it’s a song
and dance over nothing, and that the
pace and direction of Japan will change
very little as a result, neither the poli-
ticians themselves nor the mass media,
as a result, will treat it so lightly.
Interest was first aroused early on this
year when, during the House of Coun-
cillors election campaign, Sato talked
at one stage of the caucus being held
early in November. Since, at that stage,
the American general election looked
as if it might usher in radical change,
his remarks provoked objections on the
grounds that Sato, having staked his
political fortunes to a largely pro-
American policy, was intent upon mak-
ing sure that his leaning did not cause
his falling. As of now, it would seem
that the U.S. election is unlikely to
have any more than a peripheral effect
on the outcome, but, in any case, Sato
felt confident enough to withdraw his
proposal.
In any event, the main determinant
of his re-election or non-election will
be the intra-Party faction fighting now
getting up steam in the backrooms and
geisha houses of Tokyo, wherein much
Japanese political wheeling and dealing
is accomplished. “Faction” is a term
with a peculiarly Japanese relevance.
Factions do not ebb and flow with the
issues, nor are they loose coalitions and
alliances formed just for an election.
Coalitions between factions are more
likely, for the Japanese faction is itself
a political organism with a life and,
particularly, a loyalty all its own. In
the JSP or JCP such loyalty may be
partly due to a differing emphasis in
ideology; within the LDP, while talk
of adherence to differing policies by the
competing factions is not lacking, it
would seem more a cloak, for loyalties
to a personality are the principle raison
d’etre of the factions. Some commen-
tators would not even call the LDP a
“Party” in the generally understood
sense, but would even go as far as
insisting that the importance of faction
in Japanese politics creates in substance
a multi-Party system, the unstable
aspects of which have been obviated
because the various factions that com-
pose the Liberal Democratic Party
have found it in their self-interest —so
far—to stick together.
To put it another way, factions are
relatively inelastic, have their own dis-
cipline, of sorts, and, most important,
are the political focus of that vital
factor in Japanese life—group loyalty.
There are the mainstream and the
anti-mainstream factions in most
Japanese Parties, not just the LDP,
which, as their name implies, refer to
the ins and the outs. The LDP Party
presidency has changed hands every
four years or so in order to give the
ins an out and the outs an in. Label-
ling the LDP factions according to
the generally accepted political spec-
trum is unreliable, but the present
mainstream, the Sato and allied fac-
tions, can be said to represent the
moderate right while the Maeo and
Miki factions can be said to be more
in the centre.
The faction of Shigesburo Maeo was
the mainstream faction in the pre-Sato
era of former Premier Ikeda, under
whom Maeo served as Minister for
International Trade and Industry.
Unlike Miki, Maeo has had no experi-
ence in the two top jobs beneath the
Prime Ministership, the Finance and
Foreign Ministries. Further, Maeo’s
health is suspect, and while this might
be a reason for some voting for him in
the belief that his reign would not be
prolonged, it could equally be a reason
for him not being able to seriously
challenge Sato, except in so far as his
faction is the second-largest one.
The third-largest faction belongs to
Foreign Minister Takeo Miki and there
is no doubt that he has the ambition,
Sato has “uncle”-like qualities the
Japanese tend to look for in a leader
the capacity, and the standing to aspire
to the top job. Unlike the three most-
recent Prime Ministers Kishi, Ikeda,
and Sato Miki is not an ex-bureau-
crat, but a life-long professional poli-
tician, which would appear to be to his
disadvantage in the sense that big busi-
ness possibly prefers to support the ex-
bureaucrats with the money tha.t not
only helps considerably vis-a-vis the
size of one’s faction but also in the
winning of elections. Perhaps because
of this professionalism, though, Miki
strikes the outsider as being better
able to “project” both himself and
Japan. His performances on the inter-
national stage may not be to everyone’s


taste (as in Canberra in August at the
ASPAC annual meeting), but the im-
portant fact would seem to be that he
can perform. He would not, like Ikeda,
invite de Gaulle’s reported slighting
reference to “travelling transistor sales-
man,” nor, like Sato, would he (as
during the Prime Minister’s South-East
Asian tour last year) make a merely
negative impact. Against this some in-
formed Japanese sources point out that
his being better known outside Japan
is of little relevance, or importance,
inside; most LDP leaders at home push
across a rather dull shade of grey.
But, again, it is not as if personal
qualities or policy differences will be
the arbiter of Japan’s next leader.
Yasuhiro Nakasone, the present Trans-
port Minister, and another likely candi-
date in the forthcoming election, though
with a smaller faction than the three
already mentioned, has insisted that
“up-to-date policies” which can break
Liberal Democratic
Party leader
Sato indulging
in some optimistic
symbolism at
Party headquarters
Foreign Minister Miki at the ASPAC
conference in Canberra in August
the status quo that is the cause of cur-
rent “political dissatisfaction,” should
be a major consideration for the party
presidency.
His faction carries the label of Shin-
sei Doshikai (new policy group).
But will they? Old pro Shojiro
Kawashima insists that stress on policy
differences would not be wise as it
would tend to split the Party, but he
knows that in the last analysis it is
unlikely that such differences will be
aired unduly. Kawashima, himself, well
illustrates this. A leader of the so-
called “neutral” factions, he is a major
factional ally of Sato himself. But he
is also a leading practitioner of the
delicate Japanese art of political
manoeuvre in relation to all other fac-
tions “he excels at the art of co-
ordination” as the “Japan Times”
recently put it.
In short it is the mathematics of
manoeuvre that will ultimately count.
The crucial question, in this regard, is
whether or not there will be a “two-
three alliance,” as the Japanese call it.
Will the Maeo and Miki factions ally
themselves into a factional coalition
capable of upsetting Sato’s undeniably
strong re-election hopes?
So far the indications are that they
will ally themselves, though whether this
will achieve the upset must remain in
doubt. Co-operation between the two
factions began in the wake of the
factional “conferences” which were held
at health resorts last summer, and now
the “alliance” has the loose organisa-
tional form of Jinshin Isshin Suishin
Hombu (literally “people’s mind renova-
tion drive headquarters”). At the first
meeting of this organisational liaison, a
resolution was agreed that both leaders
should announce their candidacies at
least one month before the Party Con-
gress. Both leaders have yet to
announce, and the JISH urged that
they do so in order to give the “stop-
Sato drive” more propulsion. It is now
thought inevitable that Miki, at least,
will finally throw his hat into the ring
any day. He has often given private
utterance to the thought that one gets
one opportunity in a lifetime and on
that you have to gamble everything
and, if only because of his age (he is
61), this evidently looks like that time.
But will the gamble come off? At
first sight it appears contradictory that
Maeo and Miki should both stand. But
that will presumably be for the first
ballot only, when the objective will be,
without offending anyone, to make sure
that Sato doesn’t straightaway get more
than half of the 460-480 votes cast.
After that first ballot, if this objective is
achieved, it will be Sato who will prob-
ably be urging Maeo to stay in the race,
and Miki who will be hoping Maeo will
withdraw in his favor, along with Naka-
sone and any other candidate. If, at
that point, Kawashima can be induced
to switch sides, then Miki’s scenario
will have the desired happy conclusion.
Hastily, it is necessary to add that
there are potentially as many slips
twixt cup and lip as there are Japanese
bows on an ordinary day at Haneda
Airport. Sato has the advantages of the
incumbent. He has shown himself to
be a shrewd and able politician, who at
the last election certainly outshone all
the other Party leaders in his public
performance. He can project the
“uncle”-like qualities whic h the
Japanese, like several other Asian
peoples, tend to look for in their
leaders. He has demonstrated consider-
able powers of survival and recupera-
tion, notably after the “black mist”
(corruption) charges which at one stage
looked likely to dog his electoral pros-
pects. More important still, he edges
and shifts toward a direction which
the economically powerful (if not the
whole populace) find congenial. Against
all this he has had two terms, and the
factional “outs” will need considerable
inducement if they are to muster to
his support for yet another term. On
the first occasion of a Party presidential
election, votes were evidently purchased
for Yen 500,000 to Yen 800,000. Pre-
sumably, the cost of living having risen
considerably, the cost of voting will
likewise be appreciably higher on this
occasion, with some observers definitely
feeling that Sato has the financial
advantage over all comers. Beneath the
polite expressions and tea-sipping the
going will be rough and tough, and the
miracle will be that once the presi-
dential election is over, the next main-
stream and anti-mainstream factions
will again ally themselves into the
Liberal Democratic Party. Undue
bitterness (but not defection) will only
come from those who supported the
winning side, but failed to receive the
office, promise of which obtained their
support.
Thus, even as the phenomenon of
the presidential election owes its origin
to the prevalence of faction, so it sus-
tains the strength of faction. But will
the factional structure sustain the LDP
in the electorate’s favor leaving aside
that there is no alternative in sight?
Foreign Minister Miki recently ex-
pressed concern over the future of
parliamentary politics in Japan when
expressing indirect criticism of Sato.
“Government to achieve a national
fusion through dialogue and con-
fidence,” he said, was needed “rather
than through confrontation and provo-
cation.” How to meet the frustration
of contemporary people constitutes a
vital political task which statesmen must
tackle now. In the public’s eye, it is
more likely that this month will create
rather than tackle such frustration.
It will be only after the election that
it will be possible to See whether Miki,
or Sato, is to have the chance to prove
himself such a statesman.

A great
country for
wowsers
By KEITH DUNSTAN
Keith Dunstan's book "Wowsers" (Cassell Ausf. Ltd.,
$5) is published this week.
IN THE YEAR of our Lord 1968
there are still wowsers behind every
charge-sheet, sitting at every depart-
mental table, crawling from under every
cabbage. We have policemen who would
blush the color of the Union Jack if we
tried to put “Hair” on the stage at
Pier Majesty’s.
When J. D. Salinger’s “Catcher in
the Rye” became a prescribed book for
Leaving students, parents marched on
the local high school, and wrote letters
to the Minister. When Myer’s placed a
replica of Michelangelo’s David on
show in their gift department, not a
newspaper felt secure enough to publish
a photograph of the superb statue,
complete. Heads were always in discreet
positions in front of the reproductive
organs, which some would argue were
more essential than anything else—
after all, they are the origin of us all.
The TV stations were more cour-
ageous. HSV7 hews showed the statue
intact with genitals, and received only
one complaint. A lady telephoned: “Was
I dreaming or did you have a naked
man on your news session today?”
“No, Madam,” said the news chief,
“what you saw was a naked statue.”
“Oh,” said she, “well then, I don’t
know whether to lodge a complaint
or to become an avid viewer.”
This is the attitude of much of the
country. Wowserism is failing every-
where, with pressure groups in N.S.W.
even fighting for Sunday drinking. The
wowsers are still there, but they are
losing their power and even some of
their conviction. Newspaper editors no
longer take such note of their angry
letters, and the difference, the change,
over the past ten years, has been
astonishing.
In the early 19505, and even 19605,
most Australian newspapers would not
use the word “rape.” It was criminal
or indecent assault. Abortion was an
illegal operation. Prostitution was the
social evil, and (shudder) brothel was
a house of ill fame, or a disorderly
house. VD, syphilis, gonorrhea might be
rife in the community but they were
not to be mentioned by name. They
were social diseases. Most newspapers
are now uninhibited about these matters
and there are, of course, some that
. , ’
write about nothing else.
Perhaps at this stage I should explain
the now somewhat old-fashioned word
WOWSER. I love it. It rolls off the
tongue. Even if you had never heard
it before, you would instinctively know
what it meant. The Bulletin of 1912
described a wowser thus:

S la ,f ,7 inspired by Jimmy
Mirams, a Melbourne politician of the
Temperance Party, who always carried
an umbrella; “a shining light among
total abstaineis, great at tea-and-toast
parties,” according to The Bulletin.
Like many of the Melbourne wowsers,
Be lp ed l ead tß e charge in the Land
Boom and subsequently went to jai
for Bls activities.
But, to be about wowsers, and
w'ow'sing (it declines beautifully), a
wowser w r as not necessarily a teetotaller,
it was not meant to describe the man
who led a good and pure life, but
the kill-joy, the professional moaner
about everything that made life
pleasant.
There is a theory that the word
came from the old English “wow,” as
used in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Lincoln,
and Cornwall. The English Dialect
Dictionary of 1905 gives the meaning
as: “to mew as a cat. to howl or bark
as a dog, to wail, to grumble, or make
complaint.”
During the goldrush we received
so many people from these parts it is
not hard to conceive wowing or
wowsing becoming wowser.
John Norton, of “Truth,” claimed
that he invented the word. In 1910 he
said: “Wowser is as well known as the
meaning of such words and phrases
as larrikin and hooligan, bludger and
Wop.” . . . “To my humble self John
Norton alone belongs the sole undivided
glory and renown of inventing a word
that does at once describe, deride, and
denounce that numerous, noxious, pesti-
lent, puritanical, kill-joy—whole blas-
phemous, wire-whiskered brood.”
Whether he invented it or not, he
propagated it, made it as common as
the threepenny bit, and, as H. L.
Mencken once wrote, “for this he
deserves eternal bliss.”
I wanted to write a book on wowsers,
to explain, somehow, the extraordinary
streak of prudery in most Australians,
particularly the Australians of the
South. The more I investigated the
more I came to the idea that the
old-time wowser with his eternal cam-
paigning had given our cities, par-
ticularly Melbourne and Adelaide,
their special character and atmosphere,
an atmosphere that still lingers. For
example, Melbourne still adopts the
ludicrous pose of calling the eastern end
of Collins Street the Paris end,
because some of the restaurants serve
sandwiches and drinks outside. The
difference between Melbourne and
Paris is this: in Melbourne it is a sin
to drink in the street, so the custo-
mers cannot take anything stronger
than milk.
There has been much speculation
over the years as to why wowserism
ever came to Australia. This was sup-
posed to be the young, brash, devil-
may-care country. The Australian
liked to give himself the image of the


Digger of the 1914-18 war, a long,
lean, tough, brave fellow; a man who
always drank a little more than he
should, gambled a little more than he
should, swore more than he should,
perhaps a little free in his amorous
habits, a loather of discipline in all
its forms; in short, a restless man who
refused to conform, but because of
this was original, inventive, self-reliant,
and a superb man to have at one’s side
in a crisis or battle.
Yet some Australian States have
subjected themselves to laws almost as
bad as the Puritan States of the U.S.A.,
such as Massachusetts and Maine, and
have taken longer to come out of it.
Some historians believe that Melbourne
and Adelaide became this way because
they were not convict towns, and those
who came to Port Phillip did not
want a ghastly replica of what took
place in Sydney: purity at all costs
was the cry. Perhaps there was some-
thing in this, but surely the honor must
go to the non-conformist Churches.
The general belief is that those who
came to Melbourne during the gold-
rush were boozers, ne’er-do-wells, remit-
tance men, Godless, good-time hunters.
The truth is that a large percent-
age were sober people from the
North Country, and a great many of
them were unsmiling, Sabbath-loving
Methodist tinminers from Cornwall.
The rise in Methodism in Victoria,
before it lost its steam after the turn
of the century, was something phen-
omenal. The “Victorian Government
Year Book” for 1874 gives these figures
for those “usually attending church”:
Church of England, 41,180; Roman
Catholic, 66,726; Presbyterian, 62,615;
Wesleyans, 89,091.
South Australia was even more of a
non-conformist stronghold than Vic-
toria, and the very founding of the
State was a religious experiment, which
attracted the dissenters. In 1871 the
actual stated figures of members, not
churchgoers, was Church of England
27.39 percent, Methodist 19.21 percent,
and Roman Catholic 15.44 percent. Of
course, the Wesleyans, the Presbyterians,
and the Baptists were always more
vocal than anyone else. South Australia,
per head of population, set a new
record for ministers of religion. In 1895
there were 908 churches in Adelaide
alone. Then in 1891 South Australia
had more churches than hotels. There
were in the State 917 churches and
273 chapels and other places Of worship l ,
a church for every 270 people. There
were only 770 hotels.
The real heyday of wowserism was
from 1870 on; almost everything was
a sin: smoking, dancing, bathing, the
theatre, all activities but church on
Sunday, and as for reading matter, one
had to be careful of those filthy novels
that came out of France. The Mel-
bourne “Argus” had Zola taped. “His
fondness for filth is due in a great
measure to his Italian blood, poisoned
by the corrupt atmosphere of a French
Lyceum.”
The theatre was considered so cor-
rupt that no decent person could pos-
sibly be seen there. The then new
Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, Dr.
Moorehouse, shocked Melbourne in
1877 by inviting the visiting Shake-'
spearean actor William Creswick to
give a private performance at Bishop-
court. “The thing is simply monstrous,”
wrote the Reverend John Watsford, a
Methodist clergyman. “Has the theatre
ceased to be less obnoxious than
formerly; I think not.”
When President Lincoln of the United
States was assassinated, the Wesleyan
“Chronicle” nodded its editorial head
and pointed out that, after all, “the
melancholy assassination” took place in
a theatre. And look who did it? a
professional actor.
Dancing also was a possible cause
of all sorts of libidinous behaviour. In
1907, one letter writer to the “Spec-
tator” bravely pointed out that there
The Reward of Virtue
W.C.T.U. Oratress: "And I reasoned with my
husband and finally induced him to sign the
pledge. I felt so exultant, my friends, that I threw
my arms around his neck and kissed him!"
A Voice (a male one, and rather husky): “And
serve him jolly well right!”
was dancing in the Bible. The immedi-
ate answer was:
1. It was performed by maidens only.
2. It was performed usually in the
daytime in the open air.
3. There are no instances in the Bible
in which the two sexes are united
in the exercise.
Indeed, there was a complaint at
the Methodist Conference that year
that dancing was being taught at Mel-
bourne’s Methodist Ladies’ College. It
brought the reply:
Let me say that at the Methodist
Ladies’ College we do not teach
dancing. A boarder whose parents
wish her to take this subject is
sent outside to learn it. We have
no entertainments capable of being
described as theatrical at the Col-
lege. Once or twice a year, at social
evenings, we have such innocent
charades as girls may fitly play,
and they are played only to an
audience of other girls.
Yours truly, W. H. Fitchett.
It was the Presbyterians who fought
so hard for the purity of the Melburnian
Sabbath. Nothing happened on Sunday,
no library, no museum, no trams, no
pubs, no newspapers, no shops, no
theatre, and only sufficient trains to
allow good people to go to church in
the morning. In 1871, the Presbyterian
“Southern Cross” complained about
that. Trains were not necessary for this.
If the preaching was not satisfactory at
their local church, then they should
move. Oddly enough, after 1880 the
Zoo was opened in Melbourne on a
Sunday. Parliament made a special
grant so that on Sunday it would be
admission free, no vile passing of money.
Rut they still wouldn’t open the
Library and Art Gallery, which would
have been free, anyway, on the excuse
that it was wrong to read books on a
Sunday and wrong to make Gallery and
Library staff work on that day. It was
morally correct to look at monkeys, but
not at books.
In 1883, the Gallery Trustees, in
defiance of Parliament, made a valiant
attempt to open it. Perhaps all would
have been well had not the Sabbatarians
noted Chloe was there. Chloe, the nude
now in Young and Jackson’s Hotel,
was on loan to the Gallery from Mr.
Thomas Fitzgerald, the Melbourne
Hospital surgeon. As Mr. John Russell
said when making his complaint about
Sunday opening: “Would any of the
gentlemen trustees permit a nude pic-
ture of their daughter or sister to be
hung there; and if not, why anyone
else's daughter?” The Gallery-Library-


Museum was closed and did not open
again on Sundays until 1904.
Sunday newspapers were another
thing. In 1889 there was a threat of a
Sunday paper in Melbourne called the
“Sunday Times.” Mr. PI. Wrixon, often
called Mr. Righteous Wrixon, brought
down the Sunday Newspapers Bill. It
was pointed out to him that all the
work for Sunday newspapers was done
on Saturdays, anyway, and if he really
wanted Sunday purity he should stop
Monday newspapers, because the work
for them was done on Sundays. But
Mr. Wrixon produced the argument
that large numbers of boys would be
used in their distribution, and they
would be employed where people mostly
congregated, near the churches, and
they, shouting out the latest horror,
would become a perfect nuisance to all
peaceful and law-abiding citizens. Mr.
Righteous Wrixon would be well satis-
Wowserism’s greatest efforts were to
make man sober and moral by legal
restraints
Chloe—A Question of Propriety
Melbourne’s Gallery was kept closed on
Sundays because Chloe was there
fled, for Melbourne still has no Sunday
newspapers.
The greatest wowser efforts, however,
were always made against the demon
drink. In the 19th century, the belief
grew that drink was the cause of all
evil. If only man could banish alcohol,
crime would cease, the jails would be
emptied, lunacy would disappear, hus-
bands would remain faithful to their
wives, the enormous wealth spent on
drink would be spent on culture, and
in the new, splendid dry community
El Dorado would be at hand. The anti-
drink forces went through three stages.
First they tried to achieve their aims
by the nobility of their good example.
Secondly, they tried to frighten the
citizens into sobriety by painting vivid
pictures and producing awful examples
of the effects of the poison. Then, when
all else had failed, they took to the
bludgeon and had their members elected
to Parliament in the belief that they
could make man moral and sober by
law.
In the ’eighties and ’nineties there
were 30 different organisations devoted
to total abstinence. There was the Band
of Hope for juvenile abstainers, and
the Blue Ribbon for the pledge-signers.
The thing to do was to wear a piece
of blue ribbon in one’s buttonhole as
proof that one detested alcohol. The
“Alliance Record” in 1884 reported that
the bit of blue was now a familiar
object from the Melbourne “Block” to
the Mallee Scrub. Indeed, in the Mallee
there was one farmer who had become
so enthusiastic, not only did he and all
his household wear the blue ribbon but
his cows as well.
The Hon. James Munro, one-time
Premier of Victoria, who had the
honor of practically launching the
Melbourne Land Boom and ultimately
went to ruin, had the dream of solving
the drink problem by turning hotels
into coffee palaces. There were coffee
palaces all over the country, Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, Mildura. In Mel-
bourne there was the Victoria, the
Melbourne, St. Anne’s, the Prahran, the
St. Kilda, the South Yarra; in N.S.W.
there was the Sydney; and in South
Australia the Adelaide in Hindmarsh
Street and the Grayson in North
Terrace. The Federal Hotel initially
was built as a coffee palace, and so
was the Windsor early in its career.
In 1884, when Mr. Munro launched
the Grand Hotel, Spring Street, as a
coffee palace, he threw a great banquet.
Wearing the blue ribbon in his button-
hole he took out the Grand’s liquor
licence and said, “Well, gentlemen, this
is what we think of liquor,” and set a
match to it. The next day the news-
paper advertisements announced the
sale in refreshment rooms of tea, scones,
beef-tea, malt extract, and fresh milk.
That was the end of prosperity for the
Grand until it regained a licence under
the name of the Windsor, in 1920.
Almost all the other coffee palaces went
to financial ruin.
The only hope was to make men
sober by law. The temperance men
tried everything. Shorter hours did not
work, although they did stop the all-
night trading and the opening of hotels
on Sundays. Prohibition, except in local
pockets like Mildura and Renmark,
was never achieved. When the anti-
liquor Parties failed to do this, they
made Local Option their aim.
There was even a Local Option song
written by John Vale, secretary of the
Victorian Alliance. It was very rousing
when sung to the tune of Men of Har-
lech:
Men of Temp’rance all united
Women, too, your aid’s invited,
All to noble works incited,
Listen to the call!
Let not apathy surround you,
Let not idle fears astound you.
Nor the foemans strength confound
you,
Rally one and all!
Help the grand Alliance,
Bid the trade defiance,
Clear the way,
For brighter day
Of total prohibition.
See the havoc drink is working,
Everywhere the danger lurking,
Shout, your duty never shirking,
Alcohol shall fail!
This was the song to be used at Local
Option meetings all over the State.
Local Option had only limited success
in Victoria; it was much more success-
ful in N.S.W., where in 1907 293 hotels
and 46 wine bars lost their licences.
Victoria had more success with its
Licensing Reduction Board which was
designed to wipe out the small,
inefficient hotel and by 1918 it had
closed 1183 hotels.
But the interesting thing in studying
the effort to make man moral by law is
how in most cases the law was totally
ineffective. Parliament in Melbourne and
Adelaide was often described as “The
Greatest Moral Show on Earth,” but
people lived as they wanted to live.
Melbourne, w r hich made such an out-
ward show of purity in the 19th century,
had far more prostitution than it has
now. Henry Varley, a touring English
evangelist, announced in 1885 that in
40 years’ experience in all parts of the
world, he had seen no city worse than
Melbourne for prostitution. One pro-
curess had assured him that she wouldn’t
sell her houses for £lO,OOO. Mr. Varley
said the worst days of Rome and Greece
knew nothing more repulsive. The
number of “fallen women” in business
was estimated at 2000.
As for Adelaide, in 1905 one of its
residents, Thistle Anderson (Mrs.
Herbert Fisher), had a brochure printed

Royal Commission after Royal Com-
mission in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney,
and Brisbane have reported on the
impossibility of stopping after-hours
and Sunday liquor trading, and off-
course betting.
The Sabbatarian axe dropped on Sun-
day drinking in South Australia in
1891.* There was a grand unsuccessful
attempt to bring it back legally in 1896,
when Mr. Tom Price told Parliament of
a lady who was magnificently defying
the law. She was a big girl and she
wore a big belt around her waist to
which she tied bottles under her dress.
She acted as courier, carting bottles
from inside the hotel to the men out-
side. The police, being modest Adelaide
gentlemen, did not dare put hands on
her.
One could go on about the problem
of making man well behaved, that
is, morally superior, by law of
Parliament. South Australia tried not
only to abolish the barmaid but also
the bookmaker. The South Australian
Royal Commission on Betting of 1933
told of the agony bookmakers suffered
at the track. They would write bets
on their fingernails, or the palms of
their hands, whitened for the occasion,
or on biscuits which could be easily
crunched, or on the back of Country
Life cigarette tins where the entries
could be removed by rubbing the tin
against the clothing, but best of all on
peppermints or conversation lollies,
which could be eaten in moments of
peril.
Some bets were even written on
cigarette papers or on a smooth two-
shilling piece.
At this same Royal Commission, there
was evidence that there were 426 book-
makers operating in 404 hotels in South
Australia and in 26 percent of cases
the licensee made the book himself.
One bookmaker even complained how
tough it was to get a good illegal beat.
All the hotels were taken and you had
to get on a waiting list.
Starting-price betting all over Aus-
tralia did not even start to wane until
the Totalisator Agency Board was intro-
duced. While Melbourne refused to
legalise the Totalisator, John Wren
established one himself at Collingwood
and became the richest man in the
State. It operated illegally with great
efficiency for 16 years and the police
were powerless to stop it.
Wowserdom has a long and fascinat-
ing history in Australia. Many of our
top wowsers' operated with great
sincerity and did much good, but many
more of them wasted their energies in
an appalling manner, and, in trying to
make their brothers pure, created
greater evils than they had ever dreamt
about.


Steele Hall-a modern
Australian politician
“WE ARE JUST as anxious to look
after the right sort of working man as
the businessman,” said Sir Thomas
Playford in 1954, to the annual general
meeting of the South Australian Liberal
and Country League. Quoting this in
her “Power in the Liberal Party,”
Katherine West remarked that “the
right sort of working man” clearly ex-
pressed Playford’s conservatism. It
could also be said that he was at that
moment expressing the considered or
tacit opinion of the Party itself, for
since its formation in 1932 and until
the present Hall Government took
office, the LCL has consistently carried
an image of stern paternalistic conser-
vatism, colored during Playford’s 27-
year rule by that man’s quite particular
vision of ordered industrial pro-
vincialism and yeomanly virtue.
But the LCL is changing. With the
defeat of the Playford Government in
1965, the obvious popular support and
acute political intelligence of the new
Attorney-General, Don Dunstan,
marked him as the man most likely
to take over the Premiership from
Frank Walsh, who was to retire. A year
before this took place, in fact, the
Walsh Government was being widely
and cynically described as the Dun-
stan Machine. So, with Sir Thomas
Playford’s decision to stand down from
Opposition Leadership, the LCL looked
for a man capable of countering the
Dunstan image of youth, dynamism,
and social liberality.
They chose Steele Hall, member for
Gouger, Opposition Leader at 38,
Premier at 39, a fresh-faced, serious-
minded, careful man. But the changes
did not stop there, and are, in fact, con-
tinuing. In the extra-parliamentary
wing, as older Tories retire, younger
Liberals are tending to take over. At
the branch level, the vigorous Young
Liberal Movement and a younger mem-
bership all round is beginning to make
itself felt at Party conferences through
its agitation over a variety of important
and contentious social, electoral, and
legislative issues.
The Playford image died hard, and
the confusion which followed this year’s
election did nothing, initially, to dispel
it. But now, on the right side of the
House again, the LCL Government has,
over the past six months, firmly estab-
lished itself and commenced a legislative
and administrative program designed,
as its election slogan promised, “to
get South Australia moving again.” In
point of fact, the State is moving at
about the same speed it was during
the Dunstan Government and suffers
from basically the same economic prob-
lems, though there is talk of major
industrial development around the
corner.
The Hall Government is cautiously
liberal in its make up and its attitudes
to a wide range of issues. It has shown
itself prepared to' bring in contentious
social legislation, like the proposed
abortion law reform and the lowering
of the drinking age to 18, while, of more
fundamental importance, it has declared
its intention to carry through an
electoral redistribution that could, in
addition to reforming the State’s com-
pletely unbalanced electorates, see it
out of office at the next election if the
established voting patterns remain
unchanged.
Then, two weeks ago, Mr. Hall
indicated that he was prepared to drag
his Party, if it would not be led, firmly
into 1968. Explaining in so many words
that he, too, w'as a democrat, he led
four Ministers and six Members to
vote for an Opposition Bill which gave
full voting rights to citizens over 21 in
Legislative Council elections. In doing
so, he was deliberately acting against
one of the key points in his Party’s
platform, property holders’ franchise
for the Council, and while the Party
has remained tight-lipped on the matter,
he must surely have created a serious
split within it and his Cabinet.
He is clearly a new kind of con-
servative politician, if he can be
described as conservative at all. It may
be better to describe him as an LCL
man of the radical tinge. We visited
him last week in the large white house,
circa 1930, he rents in Adelaide “while
I’ve got the job,” and its almost defiant
lack of ostentation seemed entirely
appropriate for the man, for his manner
is neither ostentatious, calculated, nor
guarded, but rather frank, blunt, and
good humored.
“We need a house in the city, and
chose this because of its garden. You
need a large garden for four young
children, a flat would be no good at
all,” he explained as he paused to order,
very firmly, his young son out of the
room.
No, if we wouldn’t mind, he didn’t
want to talk any further about the
Upper House. “The Party was seriously
disturbed last week, but the wound is
already healing, and I don’t want to
aggravate it. My position on the matter
is very clear and sufficiently public
already,” he added with a wry smile.
Steele Hall ... developing his Middle
West
“But I will say this: I think in South
Australia we’ve been held up too long
with worries about how we put people
into Parliament. T would like to see
the right action taken and the issue
closed as soon as possible. Then we
can get on with the job of worrying
about what they do there.”
Born on a farm at Owen, some 60
miles north of Adelaide, he explained
that his great-great-grandfather had
been a pioneer in the district, and that
the original property still remained in
the family’s hands. He was educated
to Leaving standard at State schools,
and then worked on his farm until
winning the seat of Gouger in 1959.
His pre-selection came as a surprise, for
the blue-ribbon LCL seat was sought
by a number of senior and well-known
Party men. “When the biographies
went out to the members, I didn’t think
I had a chance. I remember comparing
mine it was about three lines
to the pages of qualifications the other
candidates sported. But the district
knew me and my family well.”
Was he groomed by Sir Thomas
Playford for the leadership? “No, cer-
tainly not. It was the result of a com-
plete involvement with politics and
loyal supporters,” adding, “politics are
always uncertain, and a leader really
depends on the work of his members
and colleagues, and on their loyalty.”
Was he interested in sport at all?
“No, politics demand a great deal of
one’s life. I don’t play sport and I've


never really been an enthusiastic spec-
tator, though I do enjoy swimming.
I’m a poor swimmer, mind you, I just
enjoy it. I very rarely read, just a few
journals and magazines, and I enjoy
reading The Bulletin,” he added, smil-
ing heavily. “When I leave this job
I’ll go back to the farm. I’ve got part
of the family property up north. Not
very big at all, and not very tidy. I’m
what is known as an untidy farmer.
It’s a bit of a joke in the district. I’ve
also a piece of scrub down in the south-
east which I’m trying to turn into a
farm now before small holdings become
uneconomic. And this is happening,
you know. It’s hard going.”
At this point a young daughter
entered to shyly offer biscuits, and then
retreated to a corner to munch her own
selection. Mrs. Ann Hall came in with
coffee, and joined in the conversation.
An Arts Graduate of Adelaide Univer-
sity, Mrs. Hall complements her hus-
band’s earnest manner with her own
natural good humor, candor, and in-
telligence. We began talking about State
aid for the performing arts. Did they
feel that it was the Government’s job
to support the performing arts in the
same way as it supports public libraries
and art galleries? A tentative yes,
though Mr. Hall felt that the initial
moves should come from the com-
munity itself, for “it’s hard to sponsor
things that don’t as yet exist.” Then
again, it was really a matter of pri-
orities: “Just how much money should
a Government divert from, for instance,
hospitals?”
Mrs. Hall had views about State aid
to the arts that cut away from her hus-
band’s more cautious and politic
approach. Tending to disagree with the
proposition generally, she explained, “I
think our intellectuals devote too much
of their time and energy to quarrelling
about the arts. They specialise too
much. They should take more interest
and spend more time in the com-
munity. After all, there’s a Parliament
and country to worry about.”
The conversation ranged widely over
State personalities and Governmental
plans, and allowed us a glimpse of the
man as an individual of decided
opinions. “As a Government we have
strong views on the way the community
should develop, and if it is in our
power, we will encourage its growth in
the right direction. Cabinet decisions
are always made unanimously, but it’s
nice being in a position of influence.
We’re a pragmatic Party. The Oppo-
sition tends to do everything by the
book, and if there isn’t one, then they
get one written. We’re much more fluid
in our approach, and it gets us into less
trouble.”
On Socialism, he agreed that short of
fundamental constitutional change, it
would be impossible for State Govern-
ments to undertake radical nationalis-
ation plans, “but I use the word
Socialism critically and often because I
give it a broader meaning than most
people. The ALP is prepared to abolish
the Upper House and, eventually, State
Parliaments. They want a grand cen-
tralism. I also strongly disagree with
their industrial policies. They believe
in cutting up the cake and eating it
now. We believe in investing some in
policies that will result in increased
productivity, and a more buoyant
economy for everyone.”
And the State’s economy, how did he
see it in the immediate future? “Well,
in the long term we can be very opti-
mistic. Our industrial promotion is
beginning to take effect, but it’s going
to take time. We used to receive 18
percent of British immigrants, and now
it’s just under three percent. This is a
loss that will continue to affect the
building industry.” Yes, he stood
broadly on the same ground as the
Opposition Leader on diversification of
industry and the need to encourage the
development of new technical skills.
Don Dunstan ... liberating his Deep
South
“We’ve some good news in that direc-
tion, but I can’t say much right now.
Mind you we’re not selective in this.
We won’t discourage any kind of effec-
tive development. What we really
need in Australia are more industrial
entrepreneurs, people ready to take an
intelligent risk, who can in this State
join the ranks of such first-class firms as
S.A. Rubber Mills and Hills Industries.
The Government’s ready to help them
as much as it can.”
On social legislation: “Well, we are
prepared to act on abortion and we’re
putting it to a conscience vote. The
same goes for the 18-year-old drinking
rights, again a conscience vote. These
are important changes in their way, but
we’re not committed to change for its
own sake. You’ll probably find next
year that there’ll be very little legisla-
tion of this type.”
On State-Federal finances, his
manner was surprisingly mild. “Obvi-
ously the States will have to work out
with the Commonwealth a new financial
agreement, and, in fact, we’re well on
the way to doing so now. The position
should be much better by 1970. The
States would like to introduce some
form of income tax, perhaps one based
on the Commonwealth’s total assess-
ment. Then there’s a receipts tax of
the kind we’re to introduce. It’s certain
that all States will eventually introduce
similar measures. We intend a tax of
one-tenth of one percent, which will net
something in the vicinity of $5 million
without anyone really noticing. One
percent, which we’re not proposing,
could bring in as much as $5O million.
This kind of growth tax is obviously
one way out of the State’s present
financial difficulties. But one thing
that does worry me, however, is the
weight of taxation on the middle-income
earner. It’s hardly fair that this sector
of the community should have to bear a
disproportionate load.”
At this point Mrs. Hall looked in
around the door. “Steele, there’s a man
from the ‘Advertiser’ on the phone. He
wants to know if you’re going to say
anything about the Legislative Council
at Para Hills this afternoon.” “No, tell
him it’ll be domestic matters,” he said,
grinning more to himself than to the
room, and it was at this point, after
two hours, that we took our leave.
It is interesting to make comparisons
of the two men, Dunstan and Hall, who
are changing the whole shape and com-
plexion of South Australia’s political life.
Both of them have received criticism
from their Parties’ more conservative
wings. In Dunstan’s case, some unions
in particular have openly argued against
“domination by intellectuals” and for
a more clearly working-class leadership.
Hall, for his part, has created consid-
erable tensions over his stand for a more
equitable electorate and Upper House
franchise. And yet both men enjoy
enthusiastic popular support among the
rank and file of their organisations, and
considerable popularity in the com-
munity itself.
They are both modern politicians in
the best sense of the word, approaching
particular situations with a wide-
ranging appreciation of modern political
and social issues. With them, the old
South Australian insularity and self-
satisfaction is dying, and despair with
which many people regarded the State
Parliament is giving away to a cautious
optimism.
Opposing each other, they offer a
choice of, on one hand, Hall’s temperate,
loose-handed pragmatism in which
broad issues and general, slightly
laissez-faire philosophies' apply, while on
the other, Dunstan’s ideological and
social reform fervor which rolls a New
Deal, a Great Society, and an Artistic
Five-year Plan into one dramatic ball.
To the ordinary Soffth Australian, the
final choice will probably turn out to be
narrow and emotional, as Hall calls for
the development of his Middle West and
Dunstan seeks to liberate his Deep
South.

How different are books?
Australian publishers bunding up manuscripts for Asia
BOOK WEEK begins on November 9.
In every city of the Commonwealth,
some time this week, fairly modest
celebrations—books are not a wealthy
industry—will be held. At these, the
gossip of the trade will be exchanged
and the four main groups concerned
with books, writers, publishers, printers,
and booksellers (readers are not likely
to be strongly represented), will eye
each other over the sherry and dry
biscuits. To each group it seems to
come as a perennial surprise that the
others exist.
This year there should at least be
more to talk about than the , constant
threat—or thrill—of another wave of
takeovers, and it may become more
apparent as the parties progress that
the interests of the four sectors do not
necessarily run together, and that the
trade grows rapidly more diverse. The
typical bookshop today is not likely to
be a large shop with diverse stock in a
high-prices city location; it may be an
agency bulk-supplying schools or it may
be a milkbar, in a beach suburb, with a
good supply of lurid paperbacks for
the wet weekend trade.
The aphorism “books are different”
is always on the lips of someone in the
trade, if only as an excuse' for inepti-
tude. The question, of course, is how
different. How different may be deter-
mined when the results of the printers’
submissions to the Minister for Trade,
Mr. McEwen, for help against the com-
petition created by Australian publishers
sending their orders to Asia are known.
Also, publishers and booksellers may
soon know how different their trading
can be from selling soap or petrol when
some of their methods are reviewed by
the Trade Practices Tribunal.
The book trade has to face the fact
that at some time the tribunal, set up
under the Trade Practices Act, may
investigate what is known as the State-
ment of Terms, an agreement between
Australian booksellers and Australian
and British publishers which sets out
the conditions under which books can
be sold, and the Schedule of Prices,
which forms part of the agreement, and
from which a bookseller works out
what he can charge for a British book
sold here.
These are, in anybody’s language,
restrictive trade documents and have
been registered as such, along with
10,840 others, under the terms of the
Act. The publishers are likely to come
before the tribunal at some time when
it will be determined whether these
agreements are, or are not, in the public
interest.
The Statement of Terms ensures
among other things that the price of a
new, locally produced or distributed
book is uniform at all retail outlets.
It stipulates when a bookseller can
remainder stock and who is eligible
for discounts. The Schedule of Prices
is a sort of ready-reckoner which con-
verts a British wholesale price for a
book (which may not be the same as
the British publisher’s wholesale price
for his own country) into the Australian
retail price.
The Commissioner of Trade Prac-
tices in his first report, presented
recently, said that priorities had been
laid down and that so far only ten
major cases are due for early hear-
ing. However, these decisions may
decide the fate, one way or another,
of many or most of the agreements
registered. The Commissioner has not
disclosed the industries involved in
these ten cases.
Publishers seem fairly sanguine that
their association will emerge from
any hearing with its Statement of
Terms intact or, at most, subject to
modification. For one thing, there is no
collusion between publishers in fixing
prices for their books; this is the sense
in which the average person most
readily thinks of restrictive trade, and
the Trade Practices Commissioner’s
report seems to support this idea, with
the blackest mark likely to go against
collusive tendering.
Also, the publishers feel their case
may be strengthened by the fact that
in 1962 the Restrictive Practices Court
in Great Britain accepted that the
British equivalent of the Statement of
Terms, called the Net Book Agreement,
was not a restrictive document within
the meaning of the British Act.
The publishers feel that the State-
ment of Terms brought stability to
bookselling, but whether the tribunal
will feel that the price paid by the
community is too high remains to be
seen. New Zealand, as well as Britain,
has in recent years upheld an agree-
ment, similar to the Statement of
Terms. On the other hand, Sweden,
in 1965, decided to free bookselling
from trade restrictions.
The local book trade tends to feel
that the agreement is unobjectionable
because it is not 100 percent effective.
Whether a restrictive trade practice
is effective or not does not seem to
have much to do with whether it is just.
There is always the chance that the
trade will learn to operate it better,
although events seem to .be going
against that. The American publishers
do not operate under the agreement,
perhaps less because they are afraid that
such wickedness might get to the ears
of the stern anti-trust authorities in
their homeland than because they are
mainly in the high-priced tertiary text-
book field, which has its own stresses
and strains, not necessarily relieved by
the Statement of Terms.
One restriction in the book trade
which will not be aired before the
Australian Trade Practices Tribunal is
the agreement between British pub-
lishers and their counterparts in the
United States that the British firms
will not accept a book for publication
if rights have already been sold in
another part of what they quaintly call
the British traditional market.
Australian publishers cannot get the
right to publish an Australian edition
of an American book, which, from one
point of view, is just stiff luck for them.
However, it is clear that at times Aus-
tralian scholars and readers can be
denied access to what may be an im-
portant book to them because the
subject (it could easily be South-East
Asia) does not interest any British
publisher.
The position at the moment seems
to be that the British publishers are
clinging for as long as they can to what
is an entirely preposterous idea, while
Australian publishers wait patiently for
the inevitable breakdown of the
system.
There seems little else they can do.
The arrangement cannot be challenged
in an Australian court. It could in
theory go to an international court,
but is that sort of endeavor worth it
when other means, notably setting up in
London as Angus and Robertson have
done, may do the trick? The best and
simplest way may be for some best-
selling Australian writer (Morris West
is the prime candidate for this exercise
in nobility) to tell his British publisher
he has sold the Australian rights so
they can stick to their guns and not
publish him in Britain and be damned.
The part of the book trade which
has had the most publicity in recent
weeks is the part which normally gets
the least: the printers. The inroads of
Asian firms into the printing of Aus-
tralian-published books have had a good
deal of publicity, although undoubtedly
the printers will not be happy until
their case is ameliorated by Canberra.
The printers’ submission, prepared
with the help of two officers of the
Department of Trade, went to the
Minister, Mr. McEwen, at the end of
last month.
Although about 75 percent of books


By
PATRICIA ROLFE
sold in Australia are imported, the
Asian imports are mainly of books pub-
lished by Australian publishers. Some
of them* it is claimed, are reprints of
books, often textbooks, originally
printed in Australia. Inevitably, the
cheapness of Asian printing has caused
no noticeable fall in the price of books,
and, inevitably, publishers have said
how lucky we all are that the Asian
printers came in when they did, other-
wise books would be so much dearer.
The printers have set out their case
In a pamphlet which has been distri-
buted to anyone even vaguely interested.
This includes State Parliamentarians;
as things stand at the moment most
of the $27 million provided by the
Commonwealth for school libraries over
the next three years would go to
sustain the Asian printing houses. The
pamphlet claims that Australian pub-
lishers can get their orders filled in
Asia at landed prices which are 50
percent less than local prices. Imports
from Hong Kong have trebled in the
past 12 months. Printers, alert now to
every alarum and excursion, report that
the representatives of the Taiwan
printing industry have recently been in
Australia trying to undercut both Japan
and Hong Kong in this market.
The printers claim that theirs is
not an inefficient industry. They say
their difficulties are caused by (a) cheap
Asian labor; (b) production in Asian
free ports where materials are cheap
compared with Australia, where every
component for printing imported is sub-
ject to duty and every locally made
component is produced behind stiff
tariff protection (Asians can print on
Australian paper dumped there, then
send the book produced back into Aus-
tralia duty free); (c) the fact that books
are the only secondary product admitted
to Australia completely free of duty
and must remain free of duty.
The sudden increase in the number
of Australian publishers going to Asia
for some of their printing (Angus and
Robertson, Reader’s Digest, and Oxford
Press are now the only ones which
have not) is due to the rapid build-up
in Asian printing houses and to their
increased efficiency.
The first books went from Australia
to Asia for printing at least five years
ago. In 1966 the printers and publishers
asked for Government help for the
industry. The Department of Trade
said it would not refer the request to
the Tariff Board and with what seems
a remarkable lack of insight and fore-
sight said:
“There appears little doubt that Aus-
tralian book publishers suffer cost
disparities because of overseas com-
petitors. These disabilities appear to
lie mainly in respect of wage rates and
paper prices. However, there is no
indication that publishers have been
taking general advantage of low over-
seas quotations.
“Figures show a picture of steady
progression in the industry, there does
not appear to be any pronounced drift
in imports in recent years, and Aus-
tralian books appear to be at least
maintaining their share of the local
market. In the circumstances, the
Minister for Trade and Industry has
decided that there are insufficient
grounds for a conclusion that a Tariff
Board inquiry is warranted.”
The Trade Department must admit
that the publishing section of the
industry was very quick off the mark
to follow its advice and take “general
advantage of low overseas quotations.”
It can hardly be surprised (perhaps it
will be pleased) if the printeries also
take advantage of low-cost Asian con-
ditions and transfer their plants there,
encouraged in some places by direct
assistance, tax concessions, and guaran-
teed duty-free importation of raw
materials.
It is not likely to come to that. Even
the publishers, in between bundling up
manuscripts for Asia, say they believe
it is important for Australia to have a
complete book industrv. It is impor-
tant for the emotive reasons which
must always be taken into considera-
tion with books, and for financial
reasons: some printers have interests in
publishing (Wilke and Co. own part of
Cheshires, Lansdowne and Jacaranda,
and Griffin Press have a stake in
Rigbys), and some publishers own
printeries (Angus and Robertson and
Halstead).
What do the printers want? They
want, first, to continue to adhere to the
UNESCO Florence Agi'eement, which
ensures that there shall be no impedi-
ment to the free flow of educational,
cultural, and scientific material between
countries. This rules out duties, quotas,
or licensing of book imports.
Their first choice for help is probably
a bounty. This has been roughly esti-
mated to cost between $1,000,000 and
$1,500,000 a year. Otherwise, there
could be a bounty on imported papers
and materials; this would also have to
be extended to Australian paper manu-
facturers and in such a way as to
ensure that they can extend their range
of products as the market warrants.
The printers’ pamphlet mentions the
possibility of a manufacturing clause
which has applied for many years in
the United States. This states that to
obtain copyright in the United States a
“book in the English language by
American authors or by foreign authors
resident or domiciled in the U.S.A.
must be manufactured and printed from
type set within the U.S.A.” This has
enabled the U.S. book manufacturing
industry to be sustained without breach-
ing the Florence Agreement.
Another piece of legislation which
affects books is the Copyright Act which
went through this year. It is chiefly
remarkable for being so long in coming.
It makes few changes in literary copy-
right but deals with such things as tele-
vision, films, recording, and performing
rights.
It also affects the fate of Aus-
tralian books and authors in the
United States. Before the current
legislation, Australian copyright law
did not conform to the standard which
would entitle this country to become
a signatory of the International Copy-
right Convention. One effect of this
was that the copyright of Australian
books imported into the United States
was insecure. This apparently has, on
odd occasions, stopped American film-
makers producing films of Australian
books; Xavier Herbert’s “Capricornia”
is quoted as an example.
One matter which isn’t dealt with
decisively in the new Copyright Act is
photocopying. Before the present legis-
lation was drafted, the Spicer com-
mittee prepared a report, which was
presented in December, 1959, but in
nine years a good deal can happen.
A section of the Act deals with copy-
ing by libraries, specifically libraries
not run for profit. The Act talks about
a librarian supplying “a” copy to
someone who satisfies the librarian
that the copy is required for “research
or private study,” that he has not pre-
viously been supplied with a copy of the
same material, and who then pays for
the copy a sum not less than the cost
of the copy. The Act specifically pro-
vides against supplying two or more
articles from the same publication
unless they are on the same subject,
and talks about a copy containing only
a “reasonable portion” of a published
work.
The Act does not venture on a
definition of a “reasonable portion,”
but a pamphlet issued in Great Britain
by the Society of Authors and the
Publishers’ Association suggests limits
which authors and publishers generally
would not regard as unreasonable for
photocopying purposes. “They have
agreed,” says the pamphlet, “that they
would not normally regard it as
‘unfair’ if a single copy is made from
a copyright work of a single extract
not exceeding 4000 words, or a series
of extracts (of which none exceeds
3000 words) to a total of 8000, pro-
vided that in no case the total amount
copied exceeds ten percent of the whole
work. Poems, essays, and other short
literary works must be regarded as
whole works in themselves, and not as
‘parts’ of the volumes in which they
appear.”
The Act may be tight enough to
prevent wholesale misuse of copying

facilities by bodies such as public or
municipal libraries, but it seems sur-
prising that in such recent legislation
there seems no awareness that more and
more schools and other institutions
have their own photocopying machines,
or even that you can put 20 cents into
a machine at David Jones’ or the
General Post Office and run off a copy
of anything.
Any newspaper library can tell you
of people coming in to buy one copy
of an issue containing project material
with the express purpose of copying it
at a school for a whole class. If the
newspaper is only five cents, the cost
of the copy may be the same or more,
but a newspaper’s advertising revenue
depends in part on its maintaining
circulation figures.
In many cases students at all levels
and in all fields require only part of
a textbook. It is interesting to specu-
late how many lecturers or teachers
feel themselves legally bound by the
provisions of the Copyright Act, 1968
(What is “a” copy? One for every
member of the class? What is research
or private study? Homework?), or
morally bound to point out to their
pupils that copying can be stealing.
Photocopying is only a small window
on a future world when people will
study their miniature TV sets on the
train instead of reading a paperback.
The trade seems sanguine about this.
When you think about it, a book still
seems a compact, convenient way to
carry around a reasonably large amount
of information or entertainment. Also,
American communications companies
have recently underlined their faith in
the future of books, linked with
mechanical aids, by taking over publish-
ing companies.
Nonetheless, there are many ways in
which the book trade could be
modernised and rationalised without
sacrificing its essential character, even
if you take its essential character to
mean the right of a customer to order
one copy of . a book and expect to pay
normal retail price for it, overlooking
the paperwork and labor costs involved
in this sort of service.
Some publishers, for example Pen-
guins, are training computers to handle
stock. But even the largest bookseller
here could not make use of computers
for stock control as supermarkets do;
the enterprise is not large enough. In
the number of “items” it carries, a
bookshop is comparable only to a
pharmacy, but whereas most items a
chemist carries come from five or six
wholesalers, a bookshop deals with
hundreds of publishers and distributors.
But the strongest argument that
“books are different” seems to be that
it is an industry in which the raw
materials manuscripts are sup-
plied by people whose output is erratic,
whose delivery dates are irregular,
and on whom no sort of quality control
can be exercised. If computers could
be brought in to handle that end of
things, certainly the rest of the trade
would be happy.


The
Prime Ministers
who never
were
By PETER SAMUEL
McEwen
Hasluck
Fairhall
WHEN HAROLD HOLT died last
summer, the name of John Gorton was
only one of five names that were at
once raised as possible successors, and
right at the very beginning of the
struggle for the succession, Mr. Gorton’s
name was last among them. On the
Sunday afternoon Mr. Holt was
drowned, ordinary people thought of
McEwen, McMahon, Fairhall, and Has-
luck as the four names from which
the new Prime Minister was most likely
to be chosen.
What has happened to these four
political leaders now? The short answer
is not much. It has not been a good
year for senior Cabinet Ministers. While
it may be too early to pronounce on
how Mr. Gorton makes his decisions, it
looks as if decision-making in Govern-
ment is reverting to the Menzies style
of one-man domination, although with
a public high-handedness that Sir
Robert avoided.
Gone are the long hours of formal
Cabinet meetings, the many committees
and subcommittees of Mr. Holt’s two
years. Gone, too, is a good deal of
Ministerial responsibility. Just as the
“Australian” Government is to work
out policies and the States to administer
them, so Mr. Gorton is to decide what
the Government’s policies will be and
his Ministers are to administer them.
Under these circumstances the potential
Prime Ministers of last December have
all been de-activated.
Let’s look at them one by one.
Country Party Leader John McEwen
wanted desperately to stay on as Prime
Minister after his interim rule following
Mr. Holt’s death. How desperately will
be shown in a book to be published soon
by Alan Reid on what happened
between Mr. Holt’s death and Mr.
Gorton’s elevation to the Prime Min-
istership, which will tell of the support
within the Liberal Party for the idea
that Mr. McEwen should take over.
But after he failed, Mr. McEwen
resigned himself to his loss of the
highest office in the land. He has
remarried and, in effect, and in com-
parison with his old performance of
desperately hard work, he has now
gone into a kind of honorable semi-
retirement from day-to-day Canberra
politicking. A large proportion of his
time this year has been spent on
overseas trips.
Even if Mr. McEwen spent more time
back in the store at Canberra it is
doubtful whether he could achieve very
much. His Department of Trade and
Industry has been steadily crumbling
into insignificance over the past 18
months as a steady flow of its top
officials have resigned. Middle-level
officers have been so shuffled around
and left without experienced leadership
that only the most routine administra-
tive work continues. Manufacturers and
traders coming to Canberra to try to
make contact with the Department
(which is supposed to deal with their
problems generally) leave the capital
angry and frustrated. There are no
signs of movement in devising a ration-
alisation for the highly planned motor
industry, despite unanimous industry
demands for this. Policy formulation
has virtually ceased.
Tariff policy, long a preserve of the
Department of Trade, has recently been
taken in hand by Mr. Gorton. Usually
the Government statement on the
occasion of the tabling of the Tariff
Board’s annual report is made by the
Minister for Trade, but this year it
was handled by the Prime Minister.
He is going to look after that area of
Government personally.
In Mr. McEwen’s absence, his able
Country Party aspirant to leadership,
Mr. Anthony, with Mr. Gorton’s
guidance, is devising quite new
approaches for agriculture, tougher and
more realistic measures than the old
props and handouts. He is a man of
the medium-term solution for a problem
rather than the expedient for deferring
the search for a solution.
Treasurer McMahon is also less in the
picture. He has lost much of the very
strong position he enjoyed under Mr.
Holt, and he has a much less confident
relationship with Mr. Gorton, who could
hardly be accused of taking his side
very firmly against some of the emnity
of Mr. McEwen. It is true that Mr.
McMahon has had a quiet year, with
none of the fights that marked Mr.
McEwen’s acts of political assassina-
tion against him last year, but then Mr.
McEwen hasn’t been around so much,
and, in any case, 1968 does not seem
to be one of his fighting years. Mr.
McMahon has always had a reputation
as a tenaciously hard worker, but even
he has eased up a little since Mr.
Gorton took over.
This is understandable, since Mr.
Gorton seems to be trying to do some
of the Treasurer’s job for him. This
was illustrated most notably in the
preparation of the Budget, the culmina-
tion of any Treasurer’s work each year.
This year, for the first time, the Prime
Minister sat in on Treasury discussions
from the very beginning of briefings.
This made this year’s Budget much
more a joint effort than in any previous
Liberal Budget. In other areas, Mr.
McMahon’s influence also appears to
have been cut down. When he was over-
seas, the Prime Minister acted as
Treasurer, rather than appoint a junior
Minister to stand in. When junior Min-
isters are in this position they usually
refer any major problems that arise
during their temporary reign to the
permanent Minister. They get him on
the telephone or by ticker. But, of
course, Mr. Gorton, as acting Treasurer,
didn’t have to do this. He made such
decisions as the ban on the takeover
of the MLC himself.
Mr. McMahon is quite happy to
admit he isn’t as close to the centre of
things as he used to be. He said in Par-
liament last month that he hadn’t yet
read the controversial annual report of
the Tariff Board, implying that he had
been completely outside discussion of
Government policy toward it.
Close friends of Mr. McMahon say
that a lot of his tense driving energy
has, at least temporarily, disappeared
since the power struggle in the summer.
He, too, is now quite resigned, they
say, to the possibility' that he might
never get to the top.
Defence Minister Fairhall was the
early favorite in the Prime Ministerial
stakes. If he had wanted the job he
would have almost certainly have won.
He didn’t run for a variety of reasons
his doctor had advised him against


McMahon
it on account of health problems he had
last year; there were family reasons as
well; in any case, Mr. Fairhall is
unusual in being a Minister who simply
has never had ambitions for the top
job.
He still works busily in his Defence
portfolio, although he is inhibited by
the fact that the really vital work has
to be done by his departmental head,
Sir Henry Bland, who has to pull the
department to bits to make something
of it. He has to try to make a depart-
ment out of a bevy of interdepartmental
committees. Until that is done the
Defence Minister can’t have all that
much opportunity for getting things
done. And the reorganisation is likely
to take as long as Mr. Fairhall is likely
to be around to start producing results.
In fact, to preside over these changes
can be his greatest achievement.
Meanwhile, he is fighting for his
defence policy. He probably didn’t
think he would have to do this with
Mr. Gorton as Prime Minister, since,
like many other people, he understood
Mr. Gorton to be a hard-liner in
defence matters. But since Mr. Gorton
has got in, he has —as we all know—
switched right around and developed a
new enthusiasm for social services and
health, and used development as an
argument for not spending any more
on defence.
Mr. Fairhall has found himself
involved in a sort of undeclared guerilla
war with the Prime Minister. Both
hostile and negotiating contacts are
sporadic but fierce. According to the
PR, the Cabinet is engaged in a collec-
tive reassessment of Australian defence
policy, but the reality is that because
the different members of the Cabinet’s
Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee
approach the problem from such differ-
ent standpoints, they have never really
been able to get a systematic discussion
going. Each has been trying to pre-
empt the other. In public speeches Mr.
Fairhall puts in his option by speaking
of the value of the F-11l as part of a
regional defence force and by saying
that Australia will have to fight more
wars like Vietnam. Mr. Gorton stakes
a rival claim to policy by speaking of
defence in “Fortress Australia” terms
as a matter of defending the Australian
mainland.
Mr. Gorton has tried to minimise the
extent of Australian commitments to
Malaysia-Singapore. He kept Mr.
Fairhall waiting for two months while
he tried to stall off approval of the
actual implementation of one of those
commitments—the offer of a Mirage
squadron. But most significant of all,
Mr. Gorton has been applying an ever-
tightening financial squeeze over future
Australian defence spending. Early on
in his Prime Ministership he specifically
rejected the Treasury formulation that
five percent of gross national product
should be the absolute limit on defence
spending, and simply said he wanted to
ensure that it did not interfere with
development or other community needs.
But last month, just before the first
meetings of the Defence and Foreign
Affairs Committee on the defence
reassessment, at the Federal Council of
the Liberal Party, he announced his
adoption of the five percent formula
and he staked his prestige on the
defence reassessment being tightly con-
strained financially. This leaves Mr.
Fairhall with little to argue for.
External Affairs Minister Hasluck
has been in a sort of tacit alliance with
Mr. Fairhall. An internationalist in his
thinking, he is appalled by Mr. Gorton’s
talk of “taking the first shock of an
attack” on Australia and casual refer-
ences to “Israel-style defence,” which
seem like . the old 19th-century
embattled nationalism of fearful white
man lonely and without friends in a
hostile environment. Such talk of Mr.
Gorton’s is old-fashioned even for the
not-so-modern Mr. Hasluck. The whole
direction of his work as Minister for
External Affairs has been toward an
active international role for Australia.
He has repeatedly argued the case that
by a combination of wise diplomacy
and careful offers of economic and
military assistance, medium - sized
powers like Australia can play a sig-
nificant role in moulding the inter-
national environment—certainly in their
immediate vicinity. He clearly rejects
Mr. Gorton’s view that Australia is a
small, insignificant power, which has to
pull its head in.
Just after the meeting of the Parlia-
mentary Liberal Party at which Mr.
Gorton was elected leader, Mr. Has-
luck was seen hurrying dejectedly down-
stairs to the seclusion of his office in
the basement of the Parliament build-
ing. Great symbolism in that. Flis
colleagues say that though, of course, he
has never been a mixer, he has kept
even more to himself than he used to,
so that he had done little open fighting
for his views. Some of the Gorton sup-
porters of January are now wishing
they had voted Hasluck, but the
reclusive little man in the basement
probably doesn’t even know this. He
has a great deal of the natural martyr
in him, acting as if it is his duty to
bear defeat with a display of forced
loyalty to a policy and a style he
despises.
He keeps up his hatred for some-
thing he calls “The Press,” and when
he reminisces he can expose a harsh,
contemptuous wit toward his Party
colleagues for their choice in January,
but for the time being he works quietly
away hoping that, in spite of Prime
Ministerial huffings and puffings and
the flurry of public controversy, he can
manage to keep foreign policy on the
sane and sensible paths which he has
laboriously hewn over the years.
He is sticking to the detail as
tenaciously as before, rushing off to
meeting's of the Colombo Plan, dropping
in on Dean Rusk, meeting Aus-
tralia’s Latin-American ambassadors,
approving the addition of a Grade Four
clerk to the Foreign Aid Branch, and
correcting an assistant secretary’s
grammar. “Fundamental strategic re-
assessments” and “far-reaching defence
reviews,” and so on, are for the birds
as far as Mr. Hasluck is concerned,
though, when eventually he is called in,
he will give his colleagues the benefits
of his long-developed wisdom by re-
citing once again, in his attractively
hom'ely way, some of the truths of
foreign policy.
As with the Treasury, Mr. Gorton
has devised a very effective means of
reducing Mr. Hasluck’s influence and
establishing his own. In this case this
is achieved by the appointment of one
of the Cabinet’s most junior and insig-
nificant Ministers, Mr. Gordon Freeth,
as Acting Minister for External Affairs
whenever Mr. Hasluck is overseas
which is very often. It is doubtful
whether Mr. Hasluck fully realises what
is happening, but it is clear enough
to people in his Department. Mr. Freeth
is a Gorton crony, and in Mr. Hasluck’s
absence, problems are continually
referred to the „ Prime Minister for
decision. If a significant Minister of
more independent mind, like Mr. Went-
worth or Mr. Fraser, were made Acting
Minister for External Affairs, the Acting
Minister would be likely to make his
own decisions or work with Mr. Has-
luck rather than come to Mr. Gorton.
How will it all turn out? Where will
the Prime Ministers who might have
been end up? No one knows. But the
underlings, the junior Ministers, back-
benchers, and officials all speculate. For
instance, Miss Ainslie Gotto, the Prime
Minister’s secretary, asks the Depart-
ment of External Affairs for a list of
top ambassadorial posts becoming
vacant next year that starts people
talking to us journalists. Mr. McMahon
for Paris? Mr. Hasluck for Washington?
Mr. McEwen for GG, someone adds to
the list. The denials came out, but at
the same time people close to the Prime
Minister expressed astonishment that
journalists got on to it so quickly. Con-
firmation that something of the sort is
quite likely?
As for Mr. Fairhall, it is likely to
be fishing off Newcastle. But then,
guerilla wars can be quite protracted.

Plenty! They released the 3600.
It took great skill to
develop the 3600 a machine
that combines high-speed
duplicating with the ease of
copying. That produces 3600
perfect copies every hour.
Without masters. With
economy. But the real skill
of Rank Xerox lies in knowing
how to make the best use of
your copier —the most
efficient use of your
duplicator. Their
representative is the man

Always.
When you have a new 3600 word
gets around fast! 3600 copies
an hour, fast. Or a perfect

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
The casual amateur
still plays the
arbitration field
Mr. McMahon
and Sir
Richard Kirby
. .. not facing
the facts of
life
“‘OUR WAGE-FIXING SYSTEM,”
said the Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, last
week, “is a fact of life in Australia.”
For a man in this is a
remarkably fatalistic stance. The arbi-
tration system, after all, operates within
the framework of Government laws, and
these have frequently been the subject
of amendment by parliaments. What
Mr. McMahon is really saying is that
the Government has enough fights on
Its hands at present and isn’t likely to
move in the immediate future into the
arbitration field. He is saying, in effect,
that the present set-up is a political
fact of life as far as this Government
is concerned.
This is a definite retreat from a posi-
tion being developed over the course of
the past couple of years. In non-
attributable and informal statements to
journalists, senior Ministers and Gov-
ernment officials have from time to
time stated their strong dissatisfaction
with the Arbitration Commission’s work
and encouraged reports that the arbi-
tration legislation would be amended.
The suggestion was that the Act would
be changed to instruct the Commission
specifically to take into account the
economic implications of its determina-
tions. At present, of course, the whole
emphasis of the legislation is on the
role of the Commission as an indus-
trial arbiter. The failure of the Gov-
ernment to appoint to the Commission
men with economic qualifications re-
inforces the tendency of the legislation.
Proposals for change now look sure to
be shelved for the time being.
Apart from not wanting a political
barney, the Government is worried that
its line on cost inflation is hard to
sustain convincingly with statistics as
they are. For two years now wages
appear to have been raised more than
productivity and yet inflation has not
been as bad as the simple theory of
wage - cost push would suggest.
According to the consumer price index,
prices have only risen by 1.9 percent
in the year to September, despite a
5.6 percent increase in average wage
rates. Now it is quite possible produc-
tivity has risen by the difference —3.7
percent —but the Commonwealth has
been maintaining in its submissions to
the Commission that the figure is
around 2.5 percent. It can argue that
a lot of the early cost-push of the early
work-value judgments has gone into
the capital goods area and been lost
to the statistics.
Amazingly, the Bureau of Census and
Statistics produces nothing on price
trends in this area. Eventually, of
course, cost increases in capital goods
find their way through to the consumer
in higher prices for final goods, but it
can take a considerable time and the
effect is lost in with other cost pressures.
The Government is simply going to
persist in its annual effort of persuad-
ing the Commission to be reasonable.
The cogency of Commonwealth cases
has improved tremendously in the past
two years, but unfortunately the Com-
mission has reacted to more closely
reasoned argument by simply refusing
to explain its thinking. Though we
should note that this year the Com-
missioners admitted they started to
think, but found the effort too time
consuming, so they gave up thinking
and plucked a figure of $1.35 from
their wide judicial heads.
The whole performance is living
satire. Unfortunately it is serious as
well, because of its economic conse-
quences. It is of great importance to
Australia’s economic competitiveness in
international markets and to the value
of social services and savings. Many
people wonder how much longer we
can afford this casual amateurism.
INTEREST RATES
AFTER THE REBATE
DROPPING THE TAX REBATE on
the Commonwealth Government’s new
loan on Nove'mber 15 is going to in-
volve a slight increase in the interest
coupon to compensate its absence, and it
could also result in adjustments to other
official rates to preserve present interest
rate relationships within the whole
structure. As it has long been an
anomaly, anyhow, especially since the
captive net was drawn across the bond
market eight years ago, it was high time
this special incentive to woo investors
into Government bonds passed from the
scene. It won’t be missed and its going
will promote a better balance in the
official capital raising climate where
everybody down to local authorities has
to be served up to the limit of the help-
ings decided by the Loan Council. The
Tax Com'missioner is positively going to*
relish the departure, though not widows
and orphans when they get their tax
refund's, perhaps.
Talking about the matter at the
Millbank Investment Fund meeting last
week, Mr. A. C. Goode said that only
if the adjustment in the interest rate on
bonds was viewed in a vacuum could
it be regarded as indicating a change
in interest rates generally. That is
right, but it is equally true that it will
have a psychological effect at an appro-
priate time for monetary policy, follow-
ing as it does the recent tightening of
credit by the Reserve Bank and the
small increase in bank overdraft rates.
As Mr. Goode pointed out, the stronger
monetary policy line is timely in the
light of what would seem to be emerg-
ing on the balance of payments front to
the possible detriment of our overseas
reserves. Mr. Goode doesn’t think the
more cautious official attitude betokens
any wish on the part of the authorities
to restrain economic activity. Though
it is quite possible that the balance of
payments prospect warrants at least a
mild application of the brakes all the
same.
On the narrower front of relation-
ships between bond, semi-government,,
and company debenture rates, Mr.
Goode could be erring on the optim-
istic side, in minimising the possible dif-
ficulties ahead, though his stature as one
of the country’s leading underwriters
commands respect for his views. We
don’t want to get into the position where
semi-government authorities have to
scratch around for their money because
of official failure to make the interest
rate differential right. This has hap-
pened in the past to their detriment.
As for company debentures, these are


in a far better position to look after
themselves in a now much more flexible
market but always providing, of course,
that official demands for money don’t
push them into too tight a corner in
what, after all, is not a boundless arena.
On this particular playing field the
game is getting much more competi-
tive and in the ensuing contest for
funds much will depend on how far the
authorities intend to go in drawing back
from their heavy reliance on the banks
in the past two years to provide them
with funds.
MEN AND MATTERS
BREAKFAST conferences are much de
rigueur in New York and Cambridge,
but they’re rare in Melbourne, where
at 8 a.m: one day this week an obedient
financial Press sat down with no less
than Semon E. Knudsen, chairman and
chief operating officer of Ford (U.S.),
out here on a brief visit. In close
attendance, also, was the man who,
since he took over the top executive
job on the Broadmeadows campus a
year ago, has done wonders with Ford’s
profit situation here. He was able to
serve the American chief, who switched
over somewhat dramatically from
General Motors a few years ago, with
the tastiest dish of figures for years.
The Australian boss concerned is 41-
year-old American-born W. O. “Bill”
G. A. McAuslan
“Bill” Bourke
Bourke, with Ford since 1956 and in
Australia for the past four years, spend-
ing his first three here warming up to
take the box seat.
Like Mr. Knudsen, Bourke has a
switch between motor companies, too,
behind him, but his was in 1956, when
he quit Studebaker. After four years
with Ford U.S., -he moved to the
Canadian company as general sales
manager. Mr. Bourke was born and
bred in good Middle West motor coun-
try and topped his class at Depaul
University in Michigan before going on
to the University of Illinois. All this
happened after the war, in which he
was commissioned in the U.S. Army at
the age of 18 and served in the U.S.
counter-intelligence corps for three
years, mainly in Germany.
As well as gearing the Ford company
here to get its recently improved profit
performance (one that is expected to
be excelled this year), the dynamic
Bourke has engineered a minor revolu-
tion in the local company’s management
that has involved a wholesale repatria-
tion of Americans in executive positions
and their replacement by Australians—
to such effect that now there’s only a
handful of Americans left. Mr. Bourke’s
faith in Australians as managers has
also infected the likes of Mr. Knudsen,
with the result that the Australian corn-
many has been given the franchise for
sales of all Ford products (wherever
manufactured) over the whole Pacific
area. Under Mr. Bourke’s direction, this
has become a major part of the local
company’s activities. Although he runs
about in a Lincoln Continental Mark
111, one of Bourke’s pastimes is restor-
ing a Model “A” Ford, that is when
he’s not gardening at his home in
St. Georges Road, Toorak, and getting
out of the way of the numerous pets
his wife and four children keep there.
AS PART OF TPIE IBM policy of
broadening the experience of the Aus-
tralian executive, G. A. McAuslan and
J. R. Watts are taking up two-year
terms in the United States. Their chief,
managing director Alan G. Moyes, re-
turned two months ago from a 12-
month stint with the IBM World Trade
Corporation, where he made a special
study of the problem of selecting and
developing managers and marketing
representatives.
Watts, customer-engineering mana-
ger for the Australian-New Zealand
region, goes over to the field engineer-
ing division of IBM Corporation in
Chicago. Gordon McAuslan, cur-
rently industry district manager with
responsibilities in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, takes up a broader assignment
within the IBM organisation when he
goes to New York at the end of the
year. He will spend two years there
at the IBM World Trade headquarters,
as assistant to the director of data pro-
cessing marketing. In this period he
will be exposed to various facets of
the international company financial,
product development, organisation of
service facilities, forward planning of
new products, market techniques, and
government policy. In Australia he has
been concerned with direct marketing
in the field.
McAuslan joined IBM in 1956 with
a mechanical engineering degree from
Melbourne University (circa 1952), and
some years as one of the earliest execu-
tive trainees for Ford Motor Company.
He worked for Ford in Geelong and
finished up as manager of the tabulating
department, the forerunner of their data
processing. With IBM he was located
in Melbourne until 1963, and his most
senior position to that date was as data
processing marketing manager. A move
to Sydney in a similar position gave him
the opportunity to become branch man-
ager by 1965. Then it was back to his
native city in 1966 as district manager.
Since the beginning of this year he
has been responsible for the larger
accounts in both Melbourne and
Sydney. IBM divides its markets accord-
ing to needs, rather than geography.
McAuslan was responsible for the
industry-oriented accounts, banking,
insurance, public utilities, automotive
and chemical industries in the two major
cities.
WAGES-PRICES
SQUEEZE ON THE LAND
HAVING ACCEPTED wage-price
inflation as as, much an endemic part
of the Australian scene as drought,
the Federal Treasurer is hoping to
counter-balance rather than combat the
situation with, among other things,
some healthy export figures, despite an
overall slow-down in world trade. In
particular, with the drought over he is
expecting some good results from the
rural sector.
But farmers are suffering acute
problems from wage-price inflation, too,
particularly from wage inflation. That
is a problem they must sort out for
themselves. And it is no good pestering
the Federal Government to impress
their rural wage problems on the
Arbitration Commissioners for, as Mr.
McMahon pointed out last week, that
was simply proselytising to the con-
verted. Nor was there any point in
asking the Government for more
financial assistance, for that was already
a heavy burden on the taxpayer.
So rural exports are not doing too
well so far. For the first three months
of the year to September the value of
wheat exports were down $5O million
on the same period last year, butter
dropped a rough $4 million and wool
$3 million. Sugar and beef were both
up about $lO .million. Iron ore up $l7
million and coal up $lO million did
their bit in bringing the grand export
total to $747 million, $31.6 million
higher than for the same period last
year.
There is little room for consolation
let alone complacency in that. With
inflationary tendencies in a still buoyant
economy the import bill for the first
three months of the year was puffed up
ten percent on last year’s figures to $897
million, creating a trade deficit for the
quarter of $l5O million compared with
one of $99 million in 1967-68. Every
section of import classifications showed
an increase. Manufactured goods were
up $23 million to $258 million, food
and live animal imports up $5 million
to $32 million, beverages and- tobacco
up $3 million to $lO million to reflect
the nation’s endless spending spree. A
$27 million rise to $353 million for
imports of machinery and transport
equipment complements the continuing

SOME HOPEFUL MUSINGS
ON THE AILMENTS
OF A SICK PORTFOLIO
IF THE VIETNAM peace moves turn
out to be anything more than some good
electioneering for Mr. Humphrey (and
their timing gives them the indication of
being just that), then I’ll have to revise
last week’s suggestion that the market
for most good mining stocks could be
near to the bottom. But right now I’m
not prepared to change that view. And
even if peace is a real prospect, this
should not knock the outlook for the
big new development projects that are
the heart and soul of the Australian
mining markets these days. For an out-
break of peace would do wonderful
things for world trade as a whole by
getting rid of some serious pressure on
the Americans, even though it may have
some temporary depressing impact on
the level of sales of those mining pro-
ducts that feature in U.S. military pro-
curement for the Vietnam War. But
there has been nothing like the Korean
War commodities boom. So there will
be no serious downturn. But peace
could bring some easing in prices to
the copper, lead, and zinc miners for the
time being, to be followed by a good
long-term rise in a heap of exports.
With the Government talking so
much about the threat of inflation (and
I don’t see this simply as a way of try-
ing to keep the State Premiers quiet
when they ask for more money), it looks
to me as if the screws are going to be
applied pretty strongly to the economy.
The sector that is going to get it in
the neck once again will be that part
of industry which has had no real
growth for the past three years or so
—all the rapid expansion we’ve heard
about has really been concentrated in
only a few industries associated with
mineral development. If only you could
invest in the public sector; that has
been where the bulk of non-mineral
growth has been for the past few years!
Apart from the retail trade and some
consumer goods industries, it 'makes it
hard to find good industrial stocks that
will not be affected by the Govern-
ment’s new “hold the line” attitudes.
This is one reason I’ve sold out a few
of the industrials I held this week.
But I’m not entirely discouraged,
even though my portfolio looks so sick.
It certainly is hard to pick them,
though, as my experience with Metals
Exploration last week showed. I was
quite right about the good report com-
ing, but I’m still losing 50 cents a share
as a sort of penalty for being right, as
the market apparently does not seem to
share my view of how good the report
really is. This stock is worth more than
$4.90 a share on the strength of its
Nepean leases alone.
V Anyway, I’m convinced that there is
still money to be made out of buying
things in this market, despite what the
chartists say. The finance industry
looks good to me at a time when
tightening bank credit under the pres-
sure of official policy will be pushing
more and more good quality borrowers
to the hire purchase and “fringe bank-
ing” companies, but there are special
reasons for my choice of a finance
company, which is directly in the face
of depressing chartist predictions.
According to the technical men, Aus-
tralian Guarantee Corporation is setting
a “head and shoulders” pattern that
could presage a solid fall. The shares
have recently come back from their
high of $2.60 to only $2.15, which is
about 16| times earnings, a price that
has only been exceeded in terms of
earnings back in the legendary boom-
time days of 1959-60.
The special reason I like AGC is
due to its relationship with the Bank
of N.S.W. Just what is the Wales
going to do with the s22f million it is
raising in its new one-for-four premium
issue? The bank already owns 43 per-
cent of AGC; it would cost about SBJ
million to make AGC a subsidiary.
This seems a very real possibility in
view of other moves in the finance
company field in recent times and
should provide a solid underpinning of
the market for AGC shares in coming
months. Of course there are those
optimists who hope that the Wales may
follow the CBA’s lead with General
Credits and buy out the whole of
AGC’s outstanding capital. This would
cost it about $7O million at current
market prices, which would not be
beyond the bank’s ability. But this does
seem a big bite even for such a big
fish as the Bank of N.S.W. What seems
most likely is that the Wales will be
needing at least some of the money to
take up a likely new issue by AGC in
the not too distant future.

growth of the economy and a revival
of investment in industry. In the non-
rural sectors, buoyant trading for the
current quarter with record sales and

against the increasing pressures in

FISHING ZONES
PRAWNS PROTECTED
FOR AN organisation formed less than
a year ago, the Australian Fishing
Industry Council pulled off quite a
coup in Canberra last week. Helped
by the publicity associated with the
Russian ship Van Gogh’s expedition
into the Gulf of Carpentaria earlier this
year, AFIC succeeded in getting
Primary Industry Minister Doug
Anthony, protector of the prawning
industry, to forbid any new joint fishing
ventures between Australian and over-
seas interests within the 12-mile fishing
zone of the Australian coast.
Mr. Anthony declared this ban would
last until the ‘‘situation in northern
Australian prawning waters is clarified.”
But AFIC leaders, in Canberra for the
Council’s first annual general meeting,
were confident that this really meant
the end of joint fishing operations.
The Minister, beleaguered by almost
every other Australian primary industry,
might have been excused for thinking
this action would have given him some
respite from the fishermen’s demands.
But it was not to be. The agreement,
now in draft form, between Australia
and Japan over fishing within the 12-
mile zone is also under fire from fisher-
men, and their campaign is only just
beginning.
Mr. Anthony revealed last week to the
Council that the agreement, yet to be
ratified, precludes all Japanese fishing
vessels, other than long-line tuna boats,
from operating within Australia’s fishing
zone. As well, although he did not say it,
the agreement restricts Japanese tuna
fishing within the zone to a few areas
off the Australian coast.
But the Australian fishermen want
more. “We are opposed to any foreign
participation or exploitation of Aus-
tralia’s natural resources within the 12-
mile zone,” AFIC president A. W.
Ellem, general manager of the Clarence
River Fishermen’s Co-operative, told a
Press conference after the Minister’s
announcement, adding that AFIC
wanted the waters of the Gulf of
Carpentaria closed off to foreign fisher-
men, and an extension of the 12-mile
zone to cover “Australia’s natural fishing
reserves.”
Mr. Ellem’s final warning: “We will
bring continual pressure on the Govern-
ment to try to stop any foreign participa-
tion in the industry” spells troubled
waters ahead for Doug Anthony.

BRIEFLY
The economy * Australia’s balance of payments at the
end of the September quarter showed up a deficit of
$59 million, the first deficit for a year; the current
account deficit stood at $325 million, its largest for three
years. The quarter’s capital inflow reached $266 million
to run at an annual rate of $1064 million to compare
with 1967-68’s actual $1159 million.
American company investment in Australia totalled
$U.5.2354 million at the end of 1967, according to Wash-
ington figures; the total had been $1923 million a
year earlier.
The latest Federal Loan is the first since 1942 not to
carry the ten cents in the $1 tax rebate, its average increase
in interest rates turns out to be about 0.15 percent,
somewhat less than many sources predicted; securities
are offered at three, ten, 22, and 35J year maturities.
Two textile chairmen (of Bradmill and Bonds Industries)
have roundly attacked the Tariff Board’s conception of
protective levels, one of them in particular talking about
the uncertainty of the new guidelines.
The markets' A lot of erratic ups-and-downs on the
Australian share markets have really given a measure of
continuing unsureness. Some experts saw signs of the
Vietnam position influencing base metals. Oils have
become obviously flat.
BHP kept on its decline, finishing 70 cents lower at
$17.15. There wasn’t much cheer among the miners, and
the falls embraced Western Mining $9.30 (down 20 cents),
Hamersley $11.70 (50 cents), CGA $6.90 (10 cents),
King Island Scheelite $12.50 (20 cents), Great Boulder
$7.80 ($1.30), Norseman $4.70 ($2), and Metals Exploration
$4.70 ($1.10). Peko added 10 cents to close at $9.90.
Courage Brewery came on at an opening $1.30 and
ended the week at $1.24. Sugars made some moderate
gains. Bank of New South Wales dropped 48 cents to
$6.82, but Bank of Adelaide added 10 cents to touch
$2.70.
Coping with Vietnam and new cuts in consumer credit
gave equities in London an irregular look; retailers mostly
went back.
Wall Street greeted Vietnam with an initial advance,
then retreated on election doubts and profit-taking.
Companies' The takeover front spread itself over a
variety of activities . . . British-controlled Dalgety and
New Zealand Loan has bid for another Britisher, New
Zealand and Australian Land, both of them having
large pastoral property interests in Australia; Dalgety’s
offer, worth $l4 million, covers stations in N.S.W., Queens-
land, Western Australia, and New Zealand’s south island
. . . The food and grocery group Mauri Bros, and
Thomson is after fish canner Captain Products with a
combined cash and share bait; Captain directors have risen
and recom'mend the offer . . . Sydney’s Hotel Metropole,
under indeterminate seige from Hooker Corporation, itself
plans to merge with Australian Motel Industries and tops
this announcement with a one-for-four bonus to share-
holders . . . Beleaguered Sydney piecegoods merchant
Chapmans has been battered under two “first come-first
served” bids, the second of which was withdrawn on
Friday, and faces two takeover bids —one from Industrial
Equity (recommended), the other from Brisbane investor
Alexanders . . . Retailer Winns is making a one-for-one
share offer for its associate Winns Newcastle.
So the retail field still looks very active and prosperous
. . . Grace Bros.’ sales increase “at a substantial rate” and
directors describe medium and long-term prospects as
very sound . . . Also on the increase is G. J. Coles,
especially in food . . . Even Buckinghams, and without its
Oxford Street store, is starting to lift.
Transporters are another happy sector . . . Pre-tax
earnings of Thomas Nationwide Transport leapt 58 percent
in the current year’s first quarter and the group continues
to absorb other freight services; TNT also has some
$700,000 of surplus properties for sale . . . Crime
(others’) pays for Mayne Nickless, whose first 1968-69
quarter was better than any for recent years; the cash-
delivery service is attracting more customers.
The extractors aren’t out in the cold, either . . .
Hamersley’s metallised agglomerates have apparently found
favor with the Japanese . . . Fifty-one more claims, in
areas north of Kalgoorlie, have been added to Acmex’s
already large swag; this company doesn’t know who owns
about 30 percent of its capital held by nominees ... A
nickel body “of moderate thickness and good grades” has
been outlined by Metals Exploration at Nepean, W.A. (see
Mining, page 67 of this issue) . . . Pacific Copper, which
is on the way to a public issue, has disclosed greatly
increased ore reserves at the Orange (N.S.W.) copper-iron
prospect . . . Ampol Exploration earned a net $2,360,988
from Barrow Island’s oil, paid a 10 percent dividend, and
looks to be making about $1.92 a barrel which won’t be
too much eroded when the existing subsidy scheme
expires in 1970.
Mainly to cope with Australian crudes (oil, that is), a
$26 million expansion is planned at the Altona refinery;
a pipeline under Port Phillip Bay will be run by a joint
company headed by Petroleum Refineries (Australia),
Shell and BP.
Metal fabricator Australian National Industries expects
a second successive advance in sales and profits in the
1968-69 year . . . Earnings of margarine maker Marrickville
Holdings plunged from $1,247,141 to $654,506.

Fibreglass at work
A.C.I.
2 A.C.I. Fibreglass Insulation
Fibreglass, a modern material, has helped to solve many
industrial problems, such as exposure to heat and cold,
noise and the corrosive elements. For example, A.C.I.
Fibreglass building materials help to weather-condition
homes, offices, schools and factories. A.C.I. Fibreglass
Insulation tempers interior atmosphere and reduces noise
level. Fibreglass protects astronauts from the intense cold
of outer space and rocket instruments from the heat of
re-entry into the atmosphere. Undersea vessels are
protected from the pressures of the deep by fibreglass.
Fibreglass makes possible fire protective suits that not only
effectively insulate but are lightweight and manoeuvrable.
In Australia, A.C.I. is putting fibreglass to work for the
betterment of all industries. Your industry can benefit from
the experience of A.C.I. in fibreglass. A highly trained and
talented research staff at Australian Fibre Glass Pty. Ltd.
is ready to help you. Consider how A.C.I. Fibreglass can
improve your product or project.

THE LAND
The woolgrowers are split once again
THE WOOL INDUSTRY has been so
occupied arriving at an equivocal
answer to the vexed question of what
sort of authority should be established
for the proposed Australian wool-
marketing corporation (the answer be-
ing that Sir William Gunn has been
sent to scout Government support for
a corporation run for a three-year trial
period under non-statutory auspices)
that the voices of those who don’t want
a corporation at all, whatever its
authority, have been lost in the hubbub.
After the AWIC’s recent Sydney con-
ference, the spokesman of the Japanese
and Common Market wool manufac-
turers, for instance, said they had grave
anxieties that intervention by the cor-
poration in the marketing process would
disturb the orderly flow of wool to the
textile manufacturers and compound
their uncertainties about wool supplies
to the extent that many would be driven
into the synthetics field. It was not just
coincidence that the spokesman hap-
pened to be Mr. R. S. Henderson, also
chairman of the Australian Council of
Woolbuyers, who don’t want a market-
ing authority, least of all one on which
they have no effective voice.
Woolbuyers (and brokers) have been
shy of any marketing scheme they con-
sider likely to interfere with the free
play of demand and supply at the
traditional auctions. The implicit
threat of this is admittedly only a
shadow of that in the reserve-price
plan, which they helped to have roundly
defeated at referendum. Under the pre-
sent proposal, the new set-up would
handle only small lots of wool (which
would be sold at auction in bigger lots
at its discretion; the selling to be done
by a special organisation and the scheme
to be administered by the corporation,
backed by the Government). The cor-
poration would average prices for its
pooled small lots and cover the dif-
ference between these prices and
average prices for wool over the Com-
monwealth. The corporation- would
have a beard of directors comprising
seven woolgrowers, two representatives
of the National Council of Wool Sell-
ing Brokers, and one broker outside
that body (presumably a buyer). In its
turn, the authority’s selling leg would
be controlled by a directorate of four
growers and two brokers.
This would appear to give the brokers
and buyers a good say in running the
scheme were it not for the fact that,
when this Wool Board proposal was
considered by the AWIC, the buyers
and brokers were stripped of their
voting rights, and the voting power of
the chairman of the corporation (to be
appointed by its board) would be
restricted to one vote, and that only
when a casting vote was required in
the case of a deadlock. No wonder the
brokers and buyers are jaundiced about
the proposal. The clear fact of the
matter is that growers want everything
in their own hands. And under the
wool industry’s present organisational
structure they have the whip hand.
This isn’t to say, of course, that the
AWIC’s version of the new marketing
proposal is home and hosed, carrying
as it now does control by a non-
Mr. R. V. Sewell: the AWIC at stake
statutory authority. A lot of people have
had to eat crow to get it as far as
this, and a good few more have a dish
of that bird before them, following the
AWIC’s latest conference. The original
Wool Board’s proposal last October,
with its 17 innocent and generally
acceptable points, has grown horns in
the minds of grower organisations, who
would seem to be at sixes and sevens,
and almost as confused as in the hectic
days of the reserve-price referendum,
as they contemplate the invitation of the
AWIC to give the scheme a three-year
trial under no statutory colors. The
industry organisations seem to be split
right down the middle, with, as usual,
the big grazier organisations to the
right and those housing the smaller ones
to the left.
The mood of such bodies as the Aus-
tralian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation and the Victorian Farmers’
Union, both leaders in the small-
growers’ camp, has improved a bit
since their tirades at the end of the
AWIC’s Sydney conference, but it is
still pretty testy. At that conference,
voting was more on organisational lines
than at the first one on the marketing
proposal, when a statutory authority (as
recommended by the Wool Board) was
favored by 37 to 17 votes, and, as a
result, the margin in favor shrunk to
five (30 to 25) at the Sydney vote. The
big question after Sydney was whether
the statutory authorities would meekly
accept the invitation to give a non-
statutory plan a three-year trial run
or would hang out for a third round of
voting. The inducement to accept the
trial run was the AWIC’s assurance that
in the event of the trial not being suc-
cessful under a non-statutory authority
it would apply its full weight to
persuade the Government to support a
statutory scheme in its place (albeit
the trial itself being dependent on
whether Sir William Gunn would be
successful in getting support and finan-
cial backing from the Federal Govern-
ment). This seems to have impressed
the VFL at least, which, at any rate,
considers that another vote in the
AWIC would probably produce the
same result as the Sydney one, with
members voting close to organisational
lines as then.
The views of Mr. R. V. Sewell, presi-
dent of the Australian Wool and Meat
Producers’ Federation, are not so
defeatist. To him, what seemed now to
be at stake was the future of the AWIC
as well as the marketing scheme. Going
on the general chorus of complaint
among small-grower organisations, both
could be wrecked. If they threw out
the trial run proposal, the only hope
for the scheme would be to get a big
majority for it at a referendum, as held
for the reserve-price proposal. But it
is considered that the Government
wouldn’t be impressed by a majority for
a statutory authority-run scheme of
much under 90 percent of growers.
AGRISEARCH
FARM-FRESH EGGS?
CSIRO SEEMS to be sticking to its
guns in the stale-egg argument that
blew up about a year ago. In the latest
issue of its quarterly journal, “Rural
Research,” it reiterates its finding that
eggs offered to housewives are often of
poor quality, especially in summer. The
egg-marketing boards have countered
that the Organisation’s Division of
Food Preservation, which conducted the
study, gathered the eggs and performed
the tests several years ago and that the
situation has changed markedly since.

In the absence of more recent check
tests this remains a moot point. How-
ever, accompanying the article, “Rural
Research” has reproduced large, full-
color photographs of what typical fresh
and stale eggs look like when broken
out on a flat, smooth surface. Hence-
forth, every homemaker can be her
own judge of whether she is serving
the family with good or bad eggs. If
they are stale, that is, having a thin,
runny white, she then has the problem
of apportioning the blame between her-
self, the shopkeeper, the Egg Board,
and the farmer.
. When eggs are kept at about
70 deg. F. after laying they deteriorate
to a minimum acceptable quality in
about seven days. During summer
throughout Australia the prevailing
temperatures are of this order or even
higher. At the time the study was con-
ducted, the eggs took from five to six-
teen days to move through the market-
ing channels and arrive at the shop
counter. If the housewife only shopped
once a week, some of the eggs would
be over three weeks old by the time she
broke out the last of her purchase. Eggs
held under cool storage, however, keep
much better. At 55 deg. F. they will
last a fortnight before declining to the
point of minimum recommended
quality. Some lessons arising from this
study were obvious: get the eggs from
the farms to the shopping basket as
quickly as possible and keep them
refrigerated at all times. Many shops
are still not doing this.
Less obvious sources of deterioration
occur on the farm some outside the
farmer’s control. Indeed, on the whole,
farmers send their eggs off in pretty
good condition. Thus, it has been
shown that the keeping quality of eggs
laid by young hens is considerably bet-
ter than that of the eggs of older hens.
Clearly, a farmer can’t have all his
hens young and, by the nature of things,
most of his laying flock is aging, come
summer. Furthermore, it is even pos-
sible that high temperatures begin to
affect the quality of eggs before they
are laid. Overseas studies have demon-
strated that the genetic strain of the
hens also influences egg quality.
Farmers who can afford enough labor to
gather the eggs three times a day in
summer, and who have cool-storage
facilities sufficiently large in which to
keep them until the pick-up truck
ari'ives are able to offer the market
eggs of superior quality. In the interests
of quality, farmers can take one more
step to prolong the edible life of their
eggs. They can dip them in a colorless,
odorless, and tasteless mineral oil within
ten hours of laying. Provided the oiling
is done soon, it can double the shelf-
life of the eggs. Finally, there can be
little doubt that the type of diet offered
to the layers is another factor influenc-
ing the quality of the eggs. Unfor-
tunately, science does not seem to have
probed this question very deeply and
cannot provide the farmer with much
practical advice at this juncture.
Poultry farming, already a very com-
pctitive business, could become even
more difficult for some producers if
another of the CSIRO’s suggestions is
adopted. This particular proposal calls
for a grading system whereby only
those farms that can discharge at the
farm gate eggs of a certain minimum
quality would be permitted to supply
the retail market. The others would
have to sell to the less remunerative
pulping trade. These, of course, might
be tempted to swell the ranks of the
existing rebel farmers, already
numerous, who sell their eggs outside
the official grading scheme. While the
proposal itself will assuredly provoke
acrimonious arguments, the criteria for
classifying the farms is beyond dispute.
Egg quality can be measured very
accurately and objectively by simple
gauges.
By whatever means producers and
marketers co-operate to rush cool
“farm-fresh” eggs to our breakfast
tables, a serious problem will remain
one to which the scientists will have
to address themselves. Although we
have been regaled with much “eata-
egga-day” propaganda for health sake,
the truth is that eggs are bad for the
heart. When we are able to bring
home from the shop fresher and more
flavorsome eggs, we will presumably
eat more of them and suffer more heart
attacks until some way round this
obstacle is found.
Hens, themselves, are the only
creatures, apart from humans, which
spontaneously develop hardening of the
arteries. Moreover, the nature of the
disease when examined under the micro-
scope appears to be identical in both
man and fowl. Almost 50 percent of
the deaths occurring in poultry are
due to unexplained causes. It is a good
bet that a high proportion of these
stems from heart attacks. Just as in
humans, a high-fat, high-protein diet
increases the incidence of hens that
develop severe hardening of the arteries.
Normal hen eggs contain a high per-
centage of cholesterol, the substance
believed to engender heart disease.
After a person eats an egg, the choles-
terol content of his blood rises appreci-
ably. The only known way of
counteracting this rise is by the con-
sumption of protein, which seems to
work by hastening the passage of the
food through the bowel. Hence, there is
less opportunity for the absorption of
cholesterol into the bloodstream. Pectin
is a natural substance that occurs in
fruit. Low-fat, low-protein mashes have
been formulated for poultry, with con-
sequent reduction in the level of choles-
terol circulating in their blood, but,
unfortunately, the quantity occurring
in their eggs has remained unchanged.
Whether it is possible to get them to
lay low-cholesterol eggs is not yet
known. More research will have to be
done. Meanwhile, if you don’t want to
end up wearing .someone else’s heart,
better stick faithfully to the traditional
breakfast and eat fruit as well as eggs.

The Markets
WILL RURAL CREDITS
REINVIGORATE
SHARE-BUYING POWER?
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS * THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
THE ADVANCE PAYMENTS to
Australia’s farmers under the Reserve
Bank’s rural credit arrangements
usually rise rapidly between December
and March each year. The payments
advances on crops from the current
harvest are made to give stability
to the marketing of primary produce,
particularly wheat, but involving at a
peak some 21 different crops. There are
no payments, of course, for wool.
The influence of these payments on
the investment pattern within Australia
is not remote, albeit that it is indirect.
Certainly in a peak year the rural
credit advances can have a profound
effect on the state of liquidity in the
economy. The Reserve Bank, after all,
must find the wherewithal to meet the
payments to the farmer.
The problem that has arisen this
year is a dual one; it involves a record
wheat crop and a committed policy
for a tightening of the monetary sys-
tem. The prospect of a record pump-
ing out of rural credit is incompatible
with the present banking and monetary
policy of the economy.
The traditional advance of $l.lO a
bushel of wheat, which is the major
component in the advance system, just
had to be reduced in the light of the
record crop estimates. For, even with
a crop of 450 million bushels (against
early season forecasts of a bumper 530
million), the Reserve Bank would be
faced with distribution of more than
$520 million (including the other crops
at last year’s level) at $l.lO a bushel
for wheat. It could well have meant a
payout of $5BO million at the peak
usually February. That would have
been just $223 million more than the
previous record advances level in rural
credits $357 million in February,
1968. Such a boost to liquidity would
be highly ' inflationary and of great
importance to the pattern of equity
investment. Even the reduced figure
seems likely to see a peak $4OO to $450
'million going out into the farming
community between now and next
February.
The rules of the Reserve Bank’s
rural credit department make it man-
datory for the advances to be limited
to 12 months’ duration. The advances
carry interest rates sometimes 2J per-
cent below the ruling overdraft rates
of the banking system.
Indeed, the amount of funds involved
and the cheapness of the money
advanced are diametrically opposite to
the present monetary policy of
Treasury.
A good deal of the funds distributed
in advances to the farmer this year
seem certain to go straight into the
banking system in repayment of over-
draft arrangements made during the
drought' of the previous two years.
Wheat farmers, for instance, held $133
million of trading bank funds at July
this year—almost 50 percent more than
the July, 1967, total. This will free
bank funds for placement elsewhere,
unless, of course, the Reserve Bank calls
further funds back to it by use of the
statutory reserve deposit system requir-
ing the banks to lodge funds with the
bank. That seems a likely course. The
Reserve Bank’s banking policy is already
on a tightening-up trend. The call-ups
of a total of 1 percent of the trading
bank’s deposits—the first call-up in
three years—is clear evidence of that.
None the less, it does seem likely that
the bumper wheat crop will force an
increase in the liquidity of the com-
munity, and perhaps be the basis for
some renewed interest in share buying.
The absence of buying power has been
the major factor in the 25 percent
market setback since August. There
may well be a mistaken belief that any
resurgence of share buying as a result
of the improved liquidity is permanent.
The Federal Government is com-
mitted, in effect, not to allow any great
resurgence of liquidity in the economy;
the effect of that on import demand and
consequently on the balance of pay-
ments would not be in keeping with
current level of international reserves.
However, it would not surprise to see
some improvement in share prices over
January and February if other factors
remain unaltered. On present know-
ledge, such an improvement would not
be sustained, as Reserve Bank and
Treasury carry out the present mone-
tary policy and mop up any surplus
liquidity stemming from the rural
advances—and also from any large
shortfall in the November Common-
wealth conversion of $428 million. That
conversion shortfall could provide extra
funds in the community, depending
largely on the amounts of the maturing
loan (4|- percent) held by the public.
The slight increase in rates of interest
offered in the November loan—up 0.15
percent across the broad range of offer-
ings—is hardly strong enough to
influence the share market of itself.
However, it is a move in the direction
dictated by monetary policy, although
it has been made purely as a replace-
ment of the 10 cents in the $1 tax
rebate offered in all loans since 1942.
THE CHARTIST SAYS: CRA is an interesting stock in relation to its long-
term trend. The steepest rate of. appreciation was achieved in the 1967-68 “bull”
market, when prices rose to a high of $24.60. A minor downtrend has since taken
prices to a low of $15.10 several weeks ago and a support level. The overall picture
suggests the next downside move to approximately $l3, where there could be
again strong support, but there could be a final target close to $lO which would
“test” the primary uptrend. Last sale price on 31/10/’6B $16.50.
DALGETY &. N.Z. LOAN
CONFIDENCE IN LAND
DALGETY AND NEW ZEALAND
Loan Ltd. is either a glutton for punish-
ment or sees a great future in the Aus-
tralian pastoral scene. It has offered
22 percent of its capital to gain New
Zealand and Australian Land Co. Ltd.,
the Edinburgh landlord company with
large properties throughout N.S.W.,
Queensland, W.A., and the South Island
of N.Z.
Dalgety first moved into the property-
owning business in 1963, and
immediately can into the long drought.
It had acquired the Killen family public
company, Pastoral Development (Hold-
ings) Ltd., which had some 13 proper-
ties in N.S.W. and W.A. Since then


it has bought a couple of other proper-
ties, including the largest wheatgrow-
ing station in N.S.W., “Gurley.”
NZAL will just about double Dal-
gety’s land control in Australia if the
bid is successful. There must be some
doubt about the Scots’ attitude to the
bid since it is pitched at a fairly low
total value in terms of property values,
if not on earning power.
Among many of Australia’s land-
holders there is a great habit of valu-
ing land holdings at a hypothetical
market value, then relating that value
to pretty poor earnings, and saying “we
aren’t doing well at all.” The NZAL
group is probably no different. The
offer of $l4 million worth of Dalgety
shares for properties with a market
value greatly in excess of that may not
appeal to the Scottish group.
However, Dalgety’s motivation in
planning to put 22 percent of its capital
into land-owning additions provides in-
vestors with some food for thought.
The Dalgety group has come through
some difficult times in its world-wide
organisation in recent years and still
maintains a neat profit front. Not only
the Australian drought but also the
wool situation and some difficulties in
poultry in North America have all been
overcome. The Australian properties
must offer considerable profit potential
in the London board’s eyes; why make
such a relatively large move if that was
not the case? On the score of economic
nationalism, Australian investors might
be impressed with Dalgety’s potential.
There are not too many of the
10,830,000 issued shares held here. The
bid for NZAL will not add significantly
to the Australian share register as
nearly all its shareholders are U.K.
residents.
Certainly on the score of director
confidence, Dalgety shares, at $5.30
(yielding 4.7 percent to Australian resi-
dents), are worthy of examination.
CONSOLIDATED HOME
DEPOSIT GAPS AGAIN
HOME-BUILDING concerns have
never had it so good as in the past
few years, and the results of such as
Consolidated Home Industries have
fully reflected their prosperity. For most
years since it was listed in 1962, CFII
has been showing more than three times
earnings cover for its dividend,
increased from 11 to 12 percent last
year, and the latest payment was met
from earnings of 41.6 percent, which
was a healthy improvement on the
previous year’s 36.9. The shares looked
a snip at around 68 cents earlier this
year, when their earnings yield was
enormous, and since then they’ve been
run up to three times that price before
coming back with the rest of the market
to their present $1.20. At this price the
earnings yield is as much as 17.8 per-
cent, comparing, say, with A. V. Jen-
nings’ 11 percent (latest 12 percent
payment covered 3.1 times).
Thoroughly conscious of their earn-
ings covers, the market now is currently
assessing CHI on a 5 percent
dividend yield basis as against Jennings’
3.5. Such low ratings also betoken the
fact that the housing industry has
become less vulnerable than it used to
be to idiosyncrasies in the general
economic weather, or, at least, this
seems to be so. Both companies are, of
course, involved in non-housing con-
struction to different degrees and, go-
(ing on last week’s figures giving
anticipated expenditure on a national
basis for new buildings and structures
which indicate the best rise for this half
of the year since 1965, it would appear
that no clouds are in sight for the indus-
try. Against that, the figures would have
been compiled before the Reserve
Bank’s recent tightening of credit, which
makes the remarks of Mr. T. W.
Higgins from the chair at the annual
meeting of CHI last week all the more
pertinent, in that he suggested that the
shortage of funds for housing which
had bedevilled the industry for some
time past might now become more
acute.
Mr. Higgins said that “for many
years the housing industry has been
faced with an acute shortage of money
for first-mortgage finance for the
lower-income earners. This shortage has
now been aggravated by the recent
action of the Reserve Bank in restrict-
ing bank credit. We trust that the Gov-
ernment will ensure that the present
credit restrictions are not too far-
reaching. But for permanent building
society funds and the growth of the
Housing Loans Insurance Corporation,
the finance situation would be much
more difficult. Even so,” he continued,
“the current incidence of rising costs,
which is higher than normal, is being
reflected in higher prices with a cor-
responding increase in the ‘deposit
gap.’ This could create a downturn in
domestic-housing demand that could
possibly affect the company’s contri-
bution from this activity during the
current year.”
ACI-ALEX HARVEY
GOODWILL IN N.Z.
IF AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Indus-
tries was using its parent-comany
shares to effect its merger of its New
Zealand units (with two exceptions)
with those of Alex Harvey and Sons, a
leading N.Z. packaging group, this
would hardly be the most appropriate
time to do it, because these shares have
come back from $3.55 this year to
around $2.50, and barely moved an
inch after the announcement (Harvey
shares jumped $1 in N.Z.). However,
it is proposed to finalise the capital
structure of the merged company and
the proportion of the equity going to
ACI on the basis of “profits earned and
funds employed over a period of years”;
at this stage this is expected to give
ACI about three-fifths of the equity.
Actually, two important ACI units will
not be put into the combined company,
that is, its investments in N.Z. Window
Glass and Fletcher Bernard Smith.
Apparently ACl’s units in N.Z. have
had similar growth and profit rates in
recent years.
It is not suggested that the merger
is going to do much, if anything, to
assist immediate earnings prospects of
the ACI parent company over here (the
10 percent dividend was covered 1.8
times last year).
Whatever help has been coming
from its N.Z. interests in the past
for earnings, it is unlikely that dividends
from Alex Harvey and Sons will
better it, at least for some time. This
is not to gainsay the long-term advan-
tages that ACI can expect from the
merger.
One of the generally pleasing aspects
of the deal is that it is undoubtedly
a step toward thickening the economic
community of interest between Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. Both
companies are among the leading manu-
facturers in New Zealand, and with
ACl’s imposing (and latterly rejuven-
ated) strength fathering the expansion
of the amalgamation it can hardly fail
to prosper economic relations between
the two countries. It also achieves for
ACI the goodwill that goes with
having public participation of New
Zealanders in its operations there (the
remaining 40 percent of Alex Harvey
and Sons’ shares will now be held by
the N.Z. public).
ACl’s N.Z. units, the first of which
started in 1922, will bring to the party
its monopoly of glass bottles, various
other glassware activities, corrugated
cardboard, polythene pipe, film, and
sheet, and much else in the way of
manufactures, as well as its new tie-up
with America. Alex Harvey, one of the
oldest industrial ventures in N.Z., where
it started in 1836, is somewhat smaller
than ACl’s present N.Z. combine, and
employs 2000 or more compared with
ACl’s 3000 in N.Z. Its main products
—cans, plastic containers, and its other
packaging lines complement ACl’s
very well and its plants are strategically
placed near big markets in both islands.
Fully aware that the N.Z. market as
a whole is on the small side, the inten-
tion is to orient future development of
the complex to products with good
export prospects. Whether this succeeds
in overcoming product fragmentation
problems in a “sharp run” country for
manufacturing is to be seen. At least
one of the advantages that must be
attractive to the ACI board in expand-
ing export facilities in N.Z. (rather
than, say, in Australia) is that the N.Z.
dollar is a more useful weapon in export
markets than ours at the moment.

PHILIP MORRIS RIDES
RATHER HIGH
IN MARLBORO COUNTRY
WHEN BRITISH TOBACCO'S near
monopoly of the cigarette market was
first threatened in the mid-’fifties, most
interest centred on the bigger of the
new rivals, Rothmans of Pall Mall
(Aust.) Ltd. It took the largest bite
of British Tobacco’s business, and its
star was in the ascendant until 1966.
Now it is somewhat in eclipse since a
severe setback in 1967.
A smaller star in the cigarette firma-
ment was Philip Morris (Aust.) Ltd.,
whose orbit was on a slower incline,
but still continues, supercharged in the
latest year by a takeover of certain
assets and trademarks of Gallaher,
which has retired from the Australian
scene.
Whereas Rothmans joined the divi-
dend lists in 1959 with a ten percent
payout, and rapidly increased this to
20 percent, at the same time making
frequent calls on shareholders with four
par issues in six years, Philip Morris
was more cautious, with an initial pay-
out of six percent in 1960, building up
to 13 percent in 1967 before the first
major shareholder benefit of a generous
one-for-two bonus in October, 1967.
Most of Philip Morris’ growth has been
financed therefore by retained earnings,
without relying on any long-term
borrowings. However, there has been
recourse to short-term debt, for there
are unsecured loans of $3.9 million
repayable within the current year. This
short-term debt is required for only
part of each year, during the tobacco
buying season.
Granted, Philip Morris’ market share
is about half that of Rothmans, but the
smaller company concedes nothing to
Rothmans in the strength of its finances,
and its stock market rating. While
Rothmans $1 shares selling for $2.61
yield 6.1 percent dividend, and 11.6
percent on earnings, Philip Morris
shares at $7.10 show a minute yield of
1.5 percent in income, and 8.0 percent
on earnings.
A misinterpretation in the Press of
the huge increase in Philip Morris
stocks from $9.1 million to $14.25
million brought forth a ready reply
from the company. Lor once it gave a
breakdown of stocks. Linished cigarettes
represent only seven percent of total
inventories at 1968 balance date, while
tobacco leaf constitutes 82 percent. The
build-up in tobacco leaf from $7,452,000
to $11,676,000'(up 56 percent) shows a
confident anticipation of a strong sales
grow r th in the next couple of years, as
tobacco must be held in store at least
18 months. No turnover figures are
released, as volume of sales of such a
highly competitive consumer item as


cigarettes is a carefully guarded secret.
Nor is there any reference to the per-
centage increase in turnover.
Philips Morris’ major brands, Marl-
boro and Alpine, more than maintained
their rate of growth, and the company’s
share of the Australian cigarette market
advanced in 1967-68. Acquisition of
Park Drive and Edinburgh, two
Gallaher brands, and Ritmeester cigars
further accelerated sales growth during
the year; Philip Morris and Galaxy
are the lesser brands in the range.
Figures for Australian production of
tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes suggest
a decline in per capita consumption
from 5.071 b. in 1963-64, to 4.951 b. in
the past two fiscal years. Such a decline
could be attributed to growing fears
of the relationship between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer. But the
overall market has grown from 56.1
million lb. in 1964 to 59 million lb.
in 1968 years to June.
It seems that the smoking habit is
not easily relinquished, no matter what
the medical evidence. There is scope
for the producers to change the make-
up of their product, for instance to
reduce the tar content, considered the
likeliest cause of cancer. (As has been
pointed out, the hazards of alcohol have
little effect on beer consumption and
the status of brewery stocks in the
investment market, so why should the
risk of cancer in excessive cigarette
consumption seriously affect cigarette
shares?)
None the less, results of tests carried
out on 13 brands of Australian cigar-
ettes and announced last week by the
Victorian Anti-Cancer Council suggest
that 11 of them have tar contents above
a ‘"tolerable maximum”; the highest tar
content of all being found in the
regular Philip Morris cigarette.
Obviously, the cigarette manufacturers,
and Philip Morris in particular, are
being exposed to some very unfavor-
able, nation-wide publicity, and the
trend seems likely to continue.
The most striking feature of Philip
Morris’ recent history is its accelerated
capital investment. It pursues a vigorous
policy of extension, expansion, and
modernisation, and of a total capital
expenditure in the last decade of SBJ
million, $5.9 million was spent in the
past two years. This was spent on new
manufacturing facilities required to ser-
vice existing demand, and provide for
future development, and the major
source of funds, as has been noted, was
the cheapest means of finance, retained
earnings. (Retained cash flow increased
from $884,000 in 1964, to $3,024,000
in 1968.)
The original buildings in Moorabbin
(Vic.) were completed in January, 1955,
giving Philip Morris 56,000 square feet
of floor space. In 1964, 50,000 square
feet was added to the warehouse and
factory area, and in March, 1968, a
new manufacturing plant was opened,
providing 120,000 square feet of floor
space over four acres, adjoining existing
buildings. A new bond store was opened
in May, 1968, at Moorabbin. There are
additional warehouses in The Valley
(Brisbane) and St. Leonards (Sydney).
The $3,168,000 increase in plant and
machinery in 1967 occasioned a rise in
the depreciation charge of only $91,000
to $439,000. In the latest year, net addi-
tions to plant and machinery costing
$829,000 (including some plant and
equipment transferred for Gallaher)
brought total cost to almost $7 million,
compared with $3 million in June 1966,
but the depreciation charge did not
rise proportionately over the two years.
With a $544,000 provision against plant
in 1968, accumulated provisions are
now $2.5 million, making book value of
plant and machinery 64 percent of
original cost. (By way of comparison
Rothmans’ plant and equipment is
depreciated to 45 percent of original
cost.)
The company is chaired by one of
Melbourne’s most esteemed accountants,
so one can only assume that it has
not changed its conservative policies
in the past two years.
Tax provided has always been close
to standard rates, with the exception
of 1967, when the heavy capital ex-
penditure afforded the company a tax
saving of $242,000. In the latest year,
this was only worth $43,000.
Heavy increases in wage rates have
to be contended with, but in recent

years these have been more than com-
pensated for by greater sales volume
and improved manufacturing efficiency.
If recent volume increases can be
maintained, costs will be well taken
care of.
The company is not very forth-
coming with information as to its
activities for no reference has been
made to current trading except for a
statement at the end of last month
that supplies of certain brands were
rationed in July, due to unexpectedly
high sales.
Following the one-for-two bonus last
October, the company paid an 11 per-
cent dividend which is equivalent to
16| percent pre-bonus. The present
very low income yield requires an
early lift in the dividend rate to justify
today’s high market prices of the
shares. A price of $7.10 is buying 12.7
years’ earnings, which is not buying too
much into the future compared with
some industries, but in the cigarette
industry, where personal tastes can
be fickle and anti-cancer campaigners
increasingly more persistent, a note of
caution could be sounded.
The fact that Philip Morris Inc. of
the U.S. holds about 70 percent of
issued capital creates disproportionate
pressure on the market price when
there are a few more interested local
buyers. The market was slow to
recognise the merits of this stock, but
it could be overdoing its enthusiasm
now. Another bonus cannot be expected
for at least a few years.
Mining
A NEW NICKEL MINE
ON THE WAY FROM
METALS EXPLORATION
THE HIGHLIGHT of the market last
week was undoubtedly Metals Explora-
tion’s release of drilling results at its
Nepean (W.A.) nickel prospect. The
company’s shares had slipped drastically
from $7 to as low as $4.50 during the
previous two weeks; the sudden fall,
coming as it did at a time when an
announcement was expected, did not
augur well for those who were holding
the shares in the hope of favorable
developments at the Nepean nickel area.
In the event, the shares rose quite well,
jumping from $4.50 on Wednesday
morning to reach $6.30 during trading,
and finishing at just under the $6 mark.
In the overwrought bear market at the
present time, this response was perhaps
better than could be hoped for, especi-
ally as the market hardly responded
at all to Western Mining’s announce-
ment of a large potential lateritic nickel
deposit a few days previously.
At the same time, there was not a
great deal in the release by Metals
Exploration to kindle enthusiasm; as
far as the Greenvale (Queensland)
lateritic nickel deposit is concerned, the
position is unchanged—work is con-
tinuing in order to determine the over-
all commercial feasibility of the project.
At the present stage it seems highly
likely that this deposit will eventually
be mined, as it is understood that metal-
lurgical tests have so far been satis-
tory, although not yet complete. The
main reservation about Greenvale is
that it will be a large-volume, low-
grade operation, and, as such, will be
sensitive to relatively small variations
in metal prices. The current outlook
for nickel metal is .not one of short
supply, and, in this context, it is hardly
likely that Metals Exploration’s partner,
Freeport Sulphur, would be in any way-
anxious to expedite the development of
such a deposit, even if its operational
aspects were satisfactory.
On the Nepean (W.A.) sulphide
nickel prospect, which held such
promise from initial drilling, the com-
pany’s progress has perhaps been slower

than could be expected, and in spite
of a very high level of successful drill-
holes seems to fall short of expectations.
This may be more apparent than real,
and the company’s annual meeting could
well give greater substance to the rather
sketchy information released last week,
which was restricted to length of strike,
core length, average grade, and vertical
depth of intersections. In the six months
to September 30, a total of 15 holes
had been drilled, of which nine have
passed through the mineral development
which was revealed by the company’s
second drill hole in March this year.
These holes have been over a total
length of 2000 ft. and have been drilled
on lines 400 ft. apart, being sunk so as
to intersect the ore shoot at 200 ft.
vertical intervals. The ore body appears
to be pitching flatly northward and is
still open-ended in this direction.
There appear to be good grounds for
believing that the deposit will be com-
mercially exploitable, although tonnage
so far indicated is fairly modest. The
company itself has said that insufficient
data is available properly to assess
tonnage and grade, but, even on the
patchy information given in last week’s
announcement, any realistic estimate of
reserves would be in the range of
between 250,000 and 500,000 tens of
ore. The main point of contrast between
the results from Nepean and those
obtained by Western Mining at Kam-
balda and by Great Boulder at Scotia
is that the Nepean drilling has not yet
come up with the massive intersections
encountered in those other areas. The
largest intersection at Nepean is 11.3
feet (of 5.87 percent Ni) compared
with, say, 23.2 feet (of 5.36 percent Ni)
at Kambalda and the massive 100 feet
(of 3.54 percent Ni) at Scotia. These
intersections are the stuff that mines
are made of and, even allowing for the
fact that the true widths of the orebodies
are not the same as the drill-hole inter-
sections, the Nepean deposit must be
regarded as still only prospective at
this stage.
Lest it be thought that the latest
results should relegate the company to
the ranks of the hopeful rather than
the confident, it should be noted that
the initial drilling at Kambalda covered
an area of only 600 square feet, and
Western Mining at that stage was able
to decide to establish a mining opera-
tion. Metals Exploration’s results would
certainly warrant the same decision if
it were in the position of having an
established operation nearby (as had
Western Mining), and if it did not have
to establish new facilities on the spot,
particularly in respect of water supply.
As things stand, and if the Nepean area
does not develop into a large-scale
project, it could still be feasible for
the company to send its ore to Kam-
balda for processing at Western Mining’s
plant.
It has been a characteristic feature
of drilling results, both at Kambalda
and Scotia, that the ore bodies tend to

Director
$20,000
An organisation combining some of Australia's largest and best-
known companies and representing an industry of national
significance is seeking an Executive Director who will be res-
ponsible to the Board for:
Political Liaison
Public Relations
Industry Promotion
This man will require considerable ability and stature. He will
become a public figure and may already be well known. He will
certainly be highly placed in the Public Service, in industry, in
public relations or an academic sphere. He will have good con-
tacts in political circles or be well capable of developing them.
He must be a good public speaker who would, for example,
handle successfully an on-camera television debate even if it
became controversial. He must be capable of developing close
relations at all levels with the press and other mass media.
The Director may reside in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or
Canberra. It is a career appointment.
SALARY: Negotiations will be very flexible and the organisation
will pay whatever is necessary to attract a man of the stature
required. He is unlikely to be attracted by less than $15,000 to
$20,000 and may justify more than this. A car and other gene-
rous fringe benefits, including superannuation, are provided.
ENQUIRIES: These may be directed in the closest confidence to

in grade; the drilling results from
Nepean also follow this pattern, as well
as showing that the area contains
several ore zones at different depths.
Although the company’s announcement
gave no details of the lateral extent of
the ore body, the conclusion is irre-
sistible that the area will prove to be
the home of a new nickel mine.

IT'S A MYTH OF A
SLEEPY FAMILY
IMAGE AT WINNS
IN RETAILING there is a lot to be
said in favor of sticking to the business
you know and staying out of strange
territory, as witness the fate of Reid
Murray, H. G. Palmer, and Cox
Brothers to mention but three famous
Australian debacles. Ninety years of
sticking to the business it knows in
softgoods and furnishings has given
Sydney retailer, Winns, a proprietor-
ship ratio (shareholders’ funds to total
assets) of 61 percent, which is first-rate
financial strength.
Winns started life back in 1878 when
brothers William and Isaac opened a
15 by 30ft. Newcastle drapery shop. In
1897 William Winn (great-uncle of the
present managing director) came to
Sydney and established a separate busi-
ness in Redfern, followed by a store
in Oxford Street (1911). The company
has since added further stores at Auburn
(1948), Ashfield (1951), Fairfield
(1955), Blacktown (1959), Maroubra
(1962), and Burwood (1966). Four
Newcastle stores are operated by a
separate public company, but the two
organisations have four common direc-
tors.
For a long time Winns has been
considered a conservative, sleepy,
family company which has quietly made
enough profit to provide a good in-
come for the Winn family. Actually,
this is another of the sharemarket
myths which get asserted as solid fact
after they have been floating around
for a while. Only about 20 percent
of the company’s capital is owned by
the Winn family, which is hardly an
indication of family control. Nor is the

conservative and sleepy label apt when
applied to Winns. The company was
one of the first Australian retailers to
apply data processing to stock in-
ventory control, a common technique
now but revolutionary when first intro-
duced, and has been prepared to estab-
lish stores in new housing areas against
potential population growth. A good
example of Winns’ wide-awake
approach is the Blacktown venture.
Blacktown is one of Sydney’s fastest-
growing areas, and State Planning
Authority projections show a trebling
of population by the year 2000. Exten-
sive alteration and refitting of the
Blacktown store has just been com-
pleted to cater for this growth. The
company’s policies have made it the
biggest softgoods retailer at Auburn,
Fairfield, Maroubra, Blacktown, and
Redfern, which is a reasonable chunk
of Sydney suburban business in the pro-
ducts handled.
Apart from activities in retail stores,
Winns is operating a highly profitable
mail-order business with thousands of
customers throughout Australia and the
Pacific Islands. In the mail-order busi-
ness Winns is one of the top two in
Australia, and has the distinction of
being the largest user of the Post
Office’s parcel post facility. Twice
yearly (end of February and beginning
of August) the company mails out an
80-page catalogue containing over 1200
different products in a size and color
range which lifts the total contents to
just under 30,000 items. The use of
six punched-tape accounting machines
feeding a data-processing installation
ensures peak efficiency in mail-order
business.
On the financial side Winns shows up
very well. The key tests to measure
profitability are the return to invested
funds (profit for ordinary to ordinary
shareholders’ funds) and return to total
funds employed (profit for ordinary to
total assets). Using 1966-67 figures
(1967-68 results are not available for
all companies) Winns ranks tenth out
of 26 in return to invested funds with
7.6 percent, and 12th in return to total
funds employed, recording 4.4 percent.
The median figures are 7.4 percent for
return to invested funds, and 3.6 per-
cent for return to total funds employed.
But that is not the whole story. Taking
return to invested funds first, Winns
outranked such notable performers as
David Jones and Boans. The fact that
these two companies improved in 1967-
68 does not make any difference to the
situation, as Winns also lifted its rating
by a comparable margin. In return to
total funds employed, Winns’ perform-
ance is even better, as it ranked higher
than Woolworths and Grace Bros., and
was very close to Waltons and David
Jones. Another bull point is that Winns’
percentage return to capital has gone
from 14.0 percent in 1962-63 to 22.5
percent in 1967-68. When added to the
other percentages already mentioned
that seems to be the performance of a

good company in the highly compe-
titive retail world.
Well, how has Winns done it? Firstly,
the company has exercised a tight con-
trol over all its operations, and has
disposed of 'unprofitable aspects of its
activities. When the Oxford Street
store’s profits began to drop in lin**
with the general downward move i„_
uptown Sydney trading, Winns cut the
retail space back to 35,000 square feet,
from 70,000 square feet, and centralised
its head office, warehouse, and mail-
order business on the Oxford Street
site. Buying for all stores is done from
head office, and there is only one
warehouse, which helps to minimise
overheads. Secondly, with the excep-
tion of the Ashfield store, all the stores
are in the 20,000 to 25,000 square feet
range, and exactly the same goods are
stocked in each store. As a result, there
is a close similarity in pattern to Wool-
worths’ and Coles’ variety stores, and
that is well known as a profitable
formula. The early difficulties with the
Burwood store, which is situated in
the Burwood Westfield shopping centre,
are being overcome, and profitability is
improving.
Thirdly, about 85 percent of the
retail-store business done by Winns is
on a cash basis, with the percentage
rising to about 95 on the mail-order
side. Consequently, the bad-debt ratio
is virtually nil, and Winns avoids the
large bad-debt write-offs of other big
retailers.

Summary: It has been announced that
Winns Sydney is to take over Winns
Newcastle on the basis of one Sydney
share for one Newcastle share. Winns
Sydney is also proposing to increase
the interim dividend, normally payable
in April, from four to five percent, as
sales are running higher than the cor-
responding period last year and esti-
mated profit is up on the budgeted
figure.
Winns shares are priced at 86 cents,
to yield 6.4 percent, and the price/
earnings ratio is 7.7 At this level they
are well underpriced in relation to
other retailers. For example, Lowes
and McDowells (both comparable to
Winns) have price/earnings ratios of
15.4 and 12.8 respectively. Yet
McDowells’ earning rate, at 17.2 per-
cent, is below Winns’ 22.5, while Lowes’
stands at 26.0 percent (adjusted for the
bonus issue).
At current prices, Winns look to me
like a good investment in the retail
trade.

THE ARTS

The Comedy Game
—or how Miss Brown
found herself in a
funny peculiar role
Double-vision view of actress Noeline Brown...from
bawdy cynicism to a bewildering conglomeration and
onward to comedy of her own
By SANDRA HALL
ANYONE who can remember Noeline
Brown in the early days of Sydney’s
Music Hall, throwing out throaty-voiced
quips in her eternal role of woman of
colorful reputation, must regard ATN
Channel 7’s “Club Show” with a certain
puzzled fascination.
In those days she projected an image
of superbly bawdy cynicism, yet here
she is assisting ex-footballer Rex
Mossop (now converted into an instant
television star) to compere a show
that does its best to look like Saturday
night at the local Leagues club even
down to the shot of the clattering
poker machine that introduces it.
Certainly, there has been a slightly
irreverent air about it lately while
Barry Creyton has been sitting tem-
porarily in Mossop’s chair, but a con-
glomeration of jugglers, magicians, and
acrobats is enough to smother any-
body’s sophistication.
But, ironically, it’s her sophistication
that put Noeline Brown into the “Club
Show” in the first place. “Franz Conde,
the producer, offered it to me first,
because they wanted somebody who
could keep talking, because it’s not
scripted,” she says, looking amused.
“I was worried about it, especially
as I have a tendency to swear now and
again. So I thought about it, and
arranged to meet him at the Chevron to
say no.
“But after two big martinis there I
was saying yes. Then I rang the chan-
nel to tell them, thinking they wouldn’t
like me doing another show in addition
to the one I was already doing, and
that they’d get me out of it. But they
were delighted. I suppose that was a
week before it started.”
And Rex Mossop? “Well, I met him
once, briefly, when he slapped me on
the back and said, ‘She’ll be jake,’ or
words to that effect. And there we
were. No, he’d never done anything
like it before. But he’s a good choice
and the birds certainly like him. It’s
really a very funny show to do.”
It mightn’t look like it, she adds,
but work on the show amounts to an
eight-hour day all Saturday is spent
in the studio rehearsing. The rest of
her week belongs to “Rita and Wally,”
ATN’s domestic comedy which grew
out of the original McGooley series
with Gordon Chater. The working-class
flavor of the Balmain McGooley days
has since been adorned with the scent
of suburban affluence, and Noeline
Brown plays Wally’s sister, Possum, an
unimpressed observer of the boorishness
of John Meillon’s Wally. She likes the
role for its “Greek Chorus” qualities.
But the series is thought to be ending
its run this year, and in the future
she would like to try something further
removed from “the kitchen sink” than
Rita and Wally managed to get them-
selves with their abandonment of
Balmain. She cites the BBC comedy
series “Not in Front of the Children,”
with Paul Daneman and Wendy Craig.
“I’d like to try something like that
with Barry (Creyton). The couple in
that are fairly sophisticated and up to
date, and she gets some good lines. I
think television comedy writing’s going
to improve here as soon as they
start writing in teams, as they do on the
‘Dick Van Dyke Show,’ which, to me,
is very professional and very well
scripted.”
She lives in Elizabeth Bay, in a flat
which has that kind of old-style elegance
arrived at by a combination of space,
light, high ceilings, and well-made
furniture. The morning sun streams in
off the water just a street away
on to a white carpet, which she’s
looking at a little doubtfully. “Well, it
used to be white. Sometimes I think
I’ll give this .up for a furnished room
in a hotel. Somehow, there just isn’t
the time . . .”
It’s Friday, her day off, she’s wearing
bell-bottom trousers, shirt, and a scarf
knotted at the neck, and she’s working
out the fact that she’ll be able to stop
going to welcome-home parties for her
friend Barry Creyton in about ten days’
time. (Creyton, back in Australia for
two months, returns to London in
December to appear in a musical.)
She has contributed scripts to the
‘"Mavis Bramston Show” and, although
she hasn’t written anything for some
time, a completed comedy script is
waiting round for possible resurrection
one day. “It’s a sort of sporting life
thing which I wrote with A 1 Thomas in
mind. I showed it to the channel and
they liked it, but at the time they
were interested in drama and they
had ‘You Can’t See Round Corners’"
going, which had a slightly similar air
to this one. But they’re talking about
a ‘Comedy Playhouse’ series for next
year, so I’ll bring it out again then.”
Australian theatre or television is
hardly rich in comedy, let alone comedy
tailored to suit a woman, so Noeline
Brown’s record six years in comedy
of some kind (it would probably be
more if it hadn’t been for six unem-
ployed months in England) is some-
thing of a feat.
It began in, of all places, the Mar-
rickville Public Library, where she
remembers she gave more time to
re-creations of Phillip Street revues for
her co-workers than cataloguing books.
“I worked for a marvellous woman
she kept me around for laughs, I think,
because I’d go through the whole show
word for word. She actually encouraged
me to do theatre work. A few of us
at the library started a group, then I
joined the Pocket Playhouse. Later, the
Phillip, probably because they were
between shows, decided to put on a
‘new faces’ revue, and at the thought of
being paid to act I leapt.”
In that show she met Barry Creyton,
who has since worked with her in a
variety of situations from the melo-
drama of the Music Hall to the
topicality of “Mavis Bramston” and the
mysteries of the “Club Show.” Arlene


Dorgan, now the wife of British comic
Will Rushton, was also among the new
faces, as was Maggie Dence, who suc-
ceeded Noeline Brown as the figure in
cartwheel hat and black dress who
symbolised Mavis Bramston.
“I became the original Mavis because
of Barry. He went to see Michael Plant,
the producer; they started talking about
this person, and they agreed she’d have
to be terrible, so who did they think
of . . .? You know, I didn’t even think
that show would get off the ground,
and, anyway, I was desperate to get
to England, so I taped my appearances
as Mavis and left. Funny, isn’t it? Four
and a half years later I get symbolically
burnt at the stake as Mavis in the new
show that’s replaced it.”
England was not encouraging. “I
didn’t get unemployment benefits
but only because I didn’t know where
to go.” Instead, she took a job with
the London School of Economics
helping delinquent children. “I thought
they’d be three- and four-year-olds, and
took along a bag of boiled sweets, but
they were 16 and 17, morq interested
in bottom-pinching than anything.”
Her timing, she believes, was wrong
for London. “I was really too old by
the time I went there, because I wasn’t
ready to do the struggling you have to
do. The thing was, I wanted to stay in
London, so I didn’t try to get jobs with
rep. companies, just, in television.”
When she came home, she went
straight into the “Mavis Bramston
Show,” this time as Noeline Brown.
What happens next year is still uncer-
tain, but if situation comedy does get
properly under way here soon it could
use the astringency of a Noeline Brown.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
REVIVED SMOOTHLY
The Heiress. Ruth and Augustus Goetz.
South Australian Theatre Company,
Adelaide.
THE South Australian Theatre Com-
pany’s final production for the year is
“The Heiress,” an effective, if melo-
dramatic, stage adaptation of Henry
James’ novel “Washington Square,”
which has been around the place as
a play and film since 1947.
The heiress is a plain, awkward,
nervous young lady of the 1850 s who
tends to sparkle when her father is
out of the room and collapse
neurotically when he or guests enter.
She is dominated by him in a subtle,
brutal way. When she is courted by a
conniving young fortune-hunter, back
from Europe after squandering his
income, her immediate acceptance of
his overtures brings her into conflict
with her father, who attempts to stop
the match, threatening to disinherit
her. On learning of this the young man
jilts her, but, following her father’s
death- and her inheritance, returns to
the attack. She, in turn, jilts him.
It is a simple, even superficial, plot,
wjth dialogue that lacks to a great
degree the psychological subtleties and
nuances of the novel. The real success
of the production, in fact, lies in the
way the cast, and in particular Judith
Dick, as the heiress, and Don Barker,
as her father, interpret and expand
their roles. They d’o so very finely.
Judith Dick’s heiress is lumpish,
stumbling, and pathetic. When her
father enters we feel she inwardly
cowers. Don Barker, on the other hand,
is a Dickensian portrait of stern-minded-
ness, rectitude, and Victorian prudence,
with a well-disguised streak of vicious-
ness. He clearly dislikes his daughter,
but it is a cross he must bear
responsibly.
As a total production, everything
works very well indeed. The cast is
uniformly good, with excellent leads.
There is an especially outstanding per-
formance from Daphne Grey, who, as
the young man’s sister, portrays, when
questioned on her brother’s motives by
the father, her disturbed loyalties with
a perfect sense of restraint and delicacy.
Directed by Les Dayman, it is a smooth,
polished piece of professionalism.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
IDEALS AND ACTUALITIES
WITH NOTHING new in Sydney for
three weeks .except dancing Russians
and the return of the wandering Fiddler,
I’ve been left free to ponder the sort
of theatre we have here, and its immedi-
ate prospects. My frame of reference is
bounded by the Ensemble, Independent,
and Old Tote regularly, Phillip Produc-
tions and Williamson’s usually, and
Community and New occasionally.
Of these, only the Community can
boast a permanent company of actors
(although the company has changed
during the year, and does not have a
director to really take advantage of this
unique situation). The Ensemble and
New favor their own ranges of actors,
and, to some extent, so do the
Independent and Old Tote, although
their casting is basically through the
same agency system that is used by
the purely commercial managements.
Actors vie for the services of the better
agencies; and under this system are
found any work that is available, which
can include appearances in television
commercials and any other sort of
advertising, as well as ABC radio, ABC
and commercial TV, and the odd film.
This engenders a particular atmosphere
among actors in Sydney a free-for-
all commercial struggle with no security
of any kind, no opportunity for learn-
ing except by cumulative experience,
and, consequently, no chance to develop
anything other than a purely egocentric,
personal style.
Rather the same problem exists for
young directors: no Sydney theatre can
afford to gamble on someone new, or
change from its present production
framework. Recent exceptions have been
the Independent’s “Tango” (Rick
Billinghurst) and the Old Tote’s “You
Never Can Tell” (Jim Sharman). But
Mr. Sharman’s Churchill Fellowship is
taking him overseas, and I doubt if
the Independent will indulge in flirta-
tions with new Polish playwrights for
some time to come. And neither of these
productions represented anything radi-
cally new for the management con-
cerned.
No one would dream of suggesting
that theatre is booming in Melbourne.
But some conclusions may be drawn
from the success of the Melbourne
Theatre Company with George Ogilvie’s
production of “Three Sisters” prob-
ably the best thing I’ve seen in theatre
in Australia. Starting from the outside,
Melbourne does not have a strong
CURRENT IN THE ARENA
EXPENSE-ACCOUNT hospitality is
easy to dispense from the after-dark
entertainments of Sydney and Mel-
bourne. Both cities cater expansively for
the liberal credit card, although not
always for the discriminating taste. But
unless one has to host an out-of-town
bigshot for a month, there is enough
superficial variety to impress.
Randomly dipping into the current
fare . . . Melbourne’s one major theatre-
restaurant, the Lido, is offering a charac-
teristically glossy revue called “Diamond
Horseshoe,” featuring the usual line of
lovelies and an imported comic named
Yonely. Harmlessly prurient tastes can
be satisfied among the strippers at the
Forbidden City, in St. Kilda; the
cerebrally inclined can spend a lonely
evening at the Comedy Theatre, where
the excellent revue “Wait a Minim” is
playing out its Melbourne season to
disappointingly small audiences. Big
spenders have discovered the Chateau,
a new $500,000 restaurant near Albert
Park, which doesn’t offer entertainment
but does have a menu and tariff to talk
about.
Sydney, at present, has the only
cabaret entertainment worth flying from
anywhere to see —the American singer
Lainie Kazan, who is creating a great
deal of excitement at Chequers and who
is both a feast for the eye and ear.
Either of Frank Strain’s theatre-
restaurants —the Sesame (near Bondi
Junction) and the Bull ’n Bush (William
Street) —offer relaxingly distinctive
entertainment and agreeably modest
menus. More elaborate is the Emperor
Room at the Hotel Menzies, where an
edited production of “Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes” is the latest —and reportedly
the last—of the hotel’s series of mini-
musicals; the Menzies is said to be
considering a return to floor-show enter-
tainment next year.


agency system actors approach man-
agements, attend auditions on their own
account; “models” appear in commer-
cials. The Melbourne Theatre Company
has a group of more than 20 actors on
long-term contract. They are reasonably
well paid half-pay, when not actually
performing and during holidays, is still
probably enough to live on. Mr. Ogilvie
holds daily classes (in improvisation,
movement, etc.) which are related to
the production in rehearsal.
Learning and working together in
reasonable security provides a framework
in which actors can develop and direc-
tors experiment creatively. “Three
Sisters” was largely a personal triumph
for Mr. Ogilvie, but I doubt if he
could have brought it off in Sydney—
at the Old Tote, say —where actors
being paid little or nothing during a
rehearsal period can not unreasonably
expect to devote a good part of their
time to earning a living elsewhere.
Robin Lovejoy’s production of “King
Lear,” for example, labored under con-
ditions of this sort. It is instructive that
we do not read of “Scofield’s ‘King
Lear,’ ” but of “Peter Brook’s,” or, more
frequently, of “the Royal Shakespeare’s
‘King Lear’ ” (and that was six years
ago): the emphasis on ideas, directors,
and ensemble companies has been the
one prevailing trend in theatre in the
past decade. None of it has happened
in Sydney yet. Indeed, we managed to
have one step toward it banned, and
its director, John Tasker, has moved on,
of necessity I suppose, to enliven the
commercial stage.
Next year’s subsidies and grants, for
what they’re worth, are still up in the
air and not likely to come down till
December. The potentially powerful
influence on theatre of the Council for
the Arts is still far from realisation;
the hope that it offered when it came
into being has diminished. No one
expected the' Council to bring about an
instantaneously invigorated theatre, but
the signs of its rather long-winded
efforts to date are not calculated to
enspirit. I’m afraid that theatre, in
Sydney at least, is in a rather run-down
and demoralised state and badly needs
a long-lasting stimulant.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
HOW THEY LOST
The Charge of the Light Brigade.
Director, Tony Richardson.
IF YOU’RE interested in discovering
the reasons for the mismanagement of
the Crimean War in general and the
catastrophic Charge in particular, Tony
Richardson’s movie will not be of much
help, though it is often fascinating to
watch, and Richardson’s opinions are
obviously sincere, though shallow and
immature.
It is a maddening film, with moments
of brilliance which never add up to a
consistent whole, probably because of
the curious decision of Richardson and
his scriptwriter, Charles Wood, to treat
David
Hemmings as
Captain Nolan
in “The Charge
of the Light
Brigade”...a
maddening film
with moments of
brilliance
the whole thing as a black comedy, as
if they were remaking “How I Won
the War” in Victorian costume.
Richardson has ambivalent feelings
about the Victorian age, beguiled by
its sumptuous ostentation and indignant
at the fact that some people had money
and power and others had nothing (a
state of affairs not entirely confined to
that era). So any scene of high life or
aristocratic leisure is bound to be
followed by a sequence showing some-
thing horrible happening to the poor
a device which is initially effective
but rapidly becomes mechanical and
predictable.
As far as any explanation of the
actual disaster, Richardson confines him-
self to the sweeping assertion that
everyone in authority, with the excep-
tion of Captain Nolan, was an arrogant
ass, which was hardly the whole story.
The lifelong, whole-hearted hatred
between Lords Lucan and Cardigan—a
very important factor in the situation—•
is passed off as schoolboyish bickering
(though the ever-reliable Harry Andrews
does manage to hint at deeper issues in
a fine performance as Lucan). Raglan,
who was certainly beyond command,
is absurdly lampooned as a batty old
coot who doesn’t even know who the
enemy is; it is to John Gielgud’s eternal
credit that he is able to drape some
shreds of aristocratic dignity round this
caricature.
In fact, as an elucidation of a his-
torical event, the film fails. It has none
of the evocation of a political climate or
of the characters of the people involved
as found in the generally underrated
“Khartoum.” The people here are only
two-dimensional figures from an anti-
upper-class tract, a fact clearly recog-
nised by Trevor Howard, who hams
it up mightily (and entertainingly) as
Cardigan; and although Captain Nolan
was one of the few really professional
soldiers on the scene and might possibly
have made a better first of the com-
mand, I don’t think he was quite such
a Red Cross Knight as David Hemmings
makes him; but the script, not the
actor, is to blame.
Yet there is a lot of the movie that
merits attention and praise, even if the
total result is unsatisfactory. The old-
style cartoons behind the credits are
strikingly original, although I found
their interruptions of the action during
the course of the film distracting. Some
of the early sequences have great
atmosphere and beauty, with their
muted color photography and beautiful
period design (it’s nice, too, to see
actresses who don’t appear to have
been varnished; Vanessa Redgrave, Jill
Bennett, and the rest lock attractive
while giving the impression that their
only cosmetics were soap and water).
And the charge itself is a highly pro-
fessional piece of camerawork and
editing. However, because screenplay
and treatment lean so heavily to one
side and is often obviously contrived,
the whole thing never touches the heart;
one is constantly admiring the cinematic
technique instead of becoming con-
cerned with the people involved.
The film ends, again on a note of
caricature, with the high-ranking officers
trying to shift the blame as the remnants
of the shattered Brigade drag them-
selves off the field. Richardson never
even hints that this classic piece of
muddling actually did bring about
drastic reforms in the system of com-
missioning in the British Army. It was
a pretty desperate remedy, certainly,
but at least the authorities learnt by
their terrible mistake; they might as
well have that little bit of credit.
TELEVISION/DENIS O'BRIEN
THE LAUGH VOID
WATCHING Australian television in
pursuit of effective comedy of its own
making is something like laughing on
an empty stomach painful. Yet vve
attend, masochistically, to each new
offering, hoping at least to collect some
small belly-laugh, optimistically believ-
ing that Australian TV eventually will
be sufficiently infected by the vast over-
seas laugh factories to the extent that
even bad imitations will be better than
nothing.
How painful it all still is. In 12
years of television, Australian comedy
is still a hollow laugh. Only the de-
rivative “Mavis Bramston” has robustly
beckoned for a laugh, and in qualitative
terms it should have been taken off the


air 18 months before it died from
malnutrition.
And so we come to “Bramston’s”
descendant—something with the most
ironically apt title of the year, “Any-
thing Goes,” which is produced and
shown in Sydney by ATN7. As a
comedy show, the first edition was such
a dismayingly unfunny disaster that
any judgment of it was confused by
bewilderment: it had to be a hurried
mistake. But there is no mistaking
genuine disaster; the second edition was
as bad as the first. At this stage, “Any-
thing Goes” looks like qualifying as the
most laughless comedy show of them all,
“Barley Charley” included. Not even
the “canned” laughter which is
emptied gustily—and out of cue —into
the sound can convince the viewer that
he is missing the joke.
The trouble with “Anything Goes,”
apart from its undisciplined and un-
inspired scripts, is its complete lack of
individual style. Laboriously modelled
on “Laugh In,” with staccato sight gags,
one-liners, and quick blackouts, it fails
to deliver even a passable imitation of
the American show’s form because it
dwells too often and too long in Mavis-
type situations and neglects to strike
any originality of its own. It is said
to be aimed at an under-30 audience,
yet its humor is uninvigoratedly senile.
It has a knowingly comical, if ill-
assorted, cast —Reg Livermore, Johnny
Lockwood, Bryan Davies, Nancye
Hayes, Barbara Wyndon, and Penny
Ramsay—yet it lacks sharply confident
performance. The whole thing is in an
unhappy limbo, partly kept there, one
suspects, by the almost desperately
uncertain direction of Jon Ewing. To
attempt television comedy of this kind
without a team of staff writers con-
stantly in attendance to initiate style
and vigor is to beg for failure.
ABC-TV also has just re-entered the
comedy market with a seven-episode
series titled “I’ve Married a Bachelor,”
produced in Sydney. It is certainly no
breakthrough in Australian situation
comedy, and in its aggressive charac-
terisation of the young Australian male
as an insensitive, beer-swilling nong
its comic ambitions do not seem much
of an advance on “Dad ’n Dave.” At
best, it is unpretentious; at worst,
improbable. Few of the lines in the
first episode of Lyle Martin’s script
were rewardingly funny; any laughter
there came from visual situations, and
even some of those were blunted by
Peter Whitford’s strenuous over-acting
as the football-obsessed bachelor.
Donald Macdonald yields too easily to a
Dave-like characterisation of his Best
Mate role, and June Thody as the ex-
asperated bride seems strangely in-
compatible with the whole production.
“I’ve Married a Bachelor” is loosely
modelled on any handful of similarly
modest British comedy shows which
arise in the hazy memory. After 12
years, we could surely hope for some-
thing better. At the very least, we
should expect to be shown signs of
humor that isn’t simply derivative.

was down in Melbourne last week wear-
ing his opera promoter’s hat. Talking
about “Falstaff,” which will open the
Trust’s 1969 season with Tito Gobbi in
the title role, Mr. Miller said, “To see
Gobbi is never to want to see that opera
done again by anyone else.” Oops!
Gobbi will only sing the role in Mel-
bourne; Robert Maconaghie will take
over when the company tours the rest
of Australia. Mr. Miller’s amended
opinion for Sydney, etc., is now
awaited.
PROMISE OF BRILLIANCE
LINED up for the ABC concert season
next year is a prodigious galaxy of
talent. The podium, as opposed to the
pulpit, ceases to be a male preserve
with the engagement of Helen Quach
as a visiting conductor. Daniel Baren-
boim will tour as conductor and pianist
with the English Chamber Orchestra,
and there is bound to be intense interest
in the Soviet conductor Arvid Yansons.
Among the pianists, the stars are Alfred
Brendel and Vladimir Ashkenazy and
it is to be hoped that the ABC can
bring Barenboim, Ashkenazy, and the
English Chamber Orchestra together,
for this combination has created a
furore in England.
Lauris Elms is being sponsored in a
full-scale tour, not before time, and
among the vocal imports Ernst Haefliger
and Lucia Popp have top international
reputations. Ruggiero Ricci, Josef Suk,
and Wanda Wilkomirska are the
violinists. If Miss Wilkomirska needs
any recommendation, the listing of
Geoffrey Parsons as her associate artist
should be enough, and it will be a
pity if the International Society for
Contemporary Music cannot cash in
aesthetically and technically on the
flautist Severina Gazzelloni, whose work
in the contemporary field is notable.
Outside the 1969 performers on con-
tract the ABC will be presenting con-
certs by artists coming under their own
steam. This group includes Gabor
Rejto, who, with Gregor Piatigorsky,
has provided the cello parts in the series
of chamber-music recordings made
under the leadership of Jascha Heifetz.
VIRGINAL DRAMA
WITH as much ambiguity as enthusi-
asm, a Sydney little-theatre group,
Studio 228, is advertising the “world
premiere of a powerful play by con-
temporary Australian writer David
Ireland.” It is described as “an incisive
drama revolving around the love-hate
relationship between men and women.”
And the name of the play? “The Virgin
of Treadmill Street.” At this distance
that makes it sound rather uncontemp-
orary.
BOWLING INTO PRINT
WHY, asked the two schoolboys, didn’t
Australia have a national cricket maga-
zine? Their innocent ignorance of the
economics of mass media was touching,
but when they began putting the hard
edge of ambition into their question
they were virtually told to run away
and play. The editor-publisher of the
last of Australia’s three earlier cricket
magazines told them they were wasting
their time; even Sir Donald Bradman
was sceptical. But cricketer-journalist
Richie Benaud was enthusiastic about
their idea and encouraged them to pur-
sue it. Support grew, a publisher was
found, and this week the first issue of
“Australian Cricket” is on the nation’s
news-stands.
Modestly behind the achievement are
Eric Beecher and Paul Cockram, both
17 years old. Eric, the editor, is still at
North Sydney Technical High School;
Paul, the production manager, left
school while the magazine was still
being planned and has since foregone
a graphic-arts course in favor of a
full-time job in production and design
with Modern Magazines Pty. Ltd., the
Sydney publisher of “Australian
Cricket.”
Neither Eric nor Paul distinguished
themselves on the cricket field while
at school. They are devoted spectators.
And it was while watching a game a
couple of years ago that their musing
took form. “We thought that a national
sport deserved a national magazine,”
says Eric. “England has an excellent
one and the number of people who play
and watch cricket in Australia seemed
to indicate to us that there would be a
big enough market for one here.”
The first issue is smartly profes-
sional, has an attractive colored cover,
and contains contributions from some
of the world’s best-known cricket per-
sonalities — Bert Oldfield, John Arlott,
Alan Davidson, Alan McGilvray,
E. W. Swanton, Ian Johnson, and
Bobby Simpson.
Eric sold the ads and scored them
from such national giants as GM-H,
Ampol, Amoco, and Slazenger. “It was
a bit awkward trying to sell space for
what was then a non-existent magazine,
but I didn’t really have much trouble,
although we would have liked more ads
for the first issue than we got.”
Beecher-Cockram plan to publish the
magazine monthly for six months and
hope to produce an annual edition dur-
ing the off-season. “We are pleased with
the first issue,” says Beecher, “but we’re
confident that the second one will be
even better. When I leave school I’ll
probably make a full-time career of
journalism. One of the advantages of
being editor of this magazine is that I
get to watch cricket and it doesn’t cost
me a thing.” .

ART/ELWYN LYNN
CONFUSED BUT MASTERLY
Leonard French. Rudy Komon Gallery,
Sydney.
ANY EXHIBITION by Leonard
French is an event, and this one is
especially so, for since his last Sydney
show, which was not for sale, he has
been to Yale on a Flarkness scholarship,
was deeply stirred by “Burn, Baby,
Burn” slogans, and has made glass
windows for the new Canberra library
and a ceiling for Melbourne’s Gallery;
he has also collected an OBE, and has
been appointed to the new National
Gallery council.
Yet, despite all these experiences of
the new worlds, French has rather
characteristically turned to the old; 23
of his works are about the Upanishads,
those ancient treatises in prose and verse
that inquire into the Divine Principle,
the means of salvation, and emphasise <
the illusory nature of the material
world. This should be a happy hunting
ground for the French of the Campion
and Creation series, and
one can, perhaps, descry
some Rajput or Mughal
formats (though without
their lissom tenderness) in
this Indian series, but some-
thing has gone wrong. Flis
catalogue quotes three
mystical chants about the
red, white, and black fires
symbolising respectively
fire, water, and earth, and
one would have expected
the Upanishads to have
deepened French’s sense of
a painting as the emblem
of unmanifested actualities,
but he resorts to banal
superficial, ill us t r ativc
devices that he is unable
to give significance in this
new iconology,
Such weaknesses are
stressed by the presence of
six other works completed
between 1962 and 1967;
these have a powerful, lux-
urious severity, a remote,
epical and heroic heraldry
in their emphatic, inexor-
able design, and muted,
enamelled surfaces. Though
his techniques remain the same, he now
indulges in gaudy, blatant color and a
symbolism as trite as that of the skull
and crossbones, all so embalmed in a
viscous, oleaginous varnish that inflex-
ible forms melt, old bones look like
white jellied eels, and the wings of a
dragonfly resemble stilton wrapped in
delicatessen plastic.
Of course, many of the Upanishad
paintings have areas that pulsate with
subdued brilliance and evocations, and
some smaller ones are splendid, v but
none has the presence, the sheer imposi-
tion of forms as Tomb of a King
(1962-1967) with its golden brown arch
revealing the hessian under it (why does
French, like a mid-Victorian, now take
such pains to disguise his means?) as
d curves about an enthrallingly balanced
abstract disc that swings above stark
banners crossing on a
pearly white above a menacing region
of solemn chaos. Other works in this
group are more geometrically severe and
ess formally inventive, but Sepulchre
and Ancient Fi agments are metaphysi-
abstracts that reveal themselves
slowly amid the play of surfaces that
are tia nsparent oi opaque, silken cream
01 f unei eal, and fiery or cool,
If these works, despite their apparent
stillness, are in subtle movement, why
did French opt for fluidity and lashings
°f confectioner’s color? Why has he
tired of enigmatic icons and turned to
the realistic commonplaces of writhing
flames, skulls, bones, doves, and dragon-
flies? Oddly enough he covers the new
fluld forms in such la Y ers °/ varnish
tdat they are as still as flies in amber,
Instead of adding to the contorted
energy of the flames, it jells them,
Two large works, Venus and Mars,
are stifled with oleaginous viscosity;
Mars is a disaster. Its wheel of destiny
“Rainbow Dragonflyby Leonard French... only
brash indulgence is suggested
is set in copper right out of featurist
decor; where its spokes meet the cir-
cumference are four death’s heads, like
Hallowe’en masks, interspersed with
birds of prey; there is a rib-cage and
various scattered bones, since Mars is
really Death for French. One has only
to think of the wan dryness of Molvig’s
rib-cages to realise how saccharine these
lollypop bones are. I know that
Mexicans have presented Christ on the
Cross in gay colors and pre-Colombians
have carved skulls in scintillating glass,
but French’s Mars is pure sweetmeat.
Yet, as with Venus, there are, especially
in the centre, some abstract shapes
where his formal power survives so
strongly that much of the rest looks
like illustrative additives. It also sur-
vives in some quite simple, formal,
stylised small works where French is
less concerned with representation; in
Sun Turtle the swirling flames become
the actual painting; Study for First
Chant (15ijr x ssoo) and First
Chant (54 x 48in., $9000) so concen-
trate on a single image with less garish
color that the effect is fine indeed, but
where gaudiness and asymmetry prevail,
as in Rainbow Dragonfly, only brash
indulgence is suggested.
This is by no means a show that
diminishes French’s importance (think,
if you can bear to, of the mean slipperi-
ness and meaner imagination of Pro
Hart), but he is, like several other
leading artists, confused. Has his work
lost unity because stained glass, that has
so preoccupied him, deals in dispersed
areas? Has he been mesmerised by the
flashing facets of the glass? We do have
the spectacle of an iconic painter seek-
ing the effects of form-destroying light
yet wanting to preserve what lies below
surface appearances. It doesn’t work;
but despite the jelled coagulation,
beautiful, superbly refulgent areas
signal the presence of French’s mastery,
as do the earlier 1962-67 paintings. I
suspect that at present he is painting
against the unevocativeness of the new,
flat abstraction, but as Greenberg
advised us: painting against any art
form, figurative or abstract, is to paint
against art.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
A PERSUASIVE BATON
FRITZ RIEGER, who was a last-
minute replacement for Karel Ancerl
in the list of visiting celebrities to the
ABC orchestral season, has proved to
be the most interesting import of the
year. Permanent conductors can describe
psychedelic patterns in the air when
fronting up to their own charges with
a reasonable hope that their gestures
will convey their intentions, but a
visiting conductor is much more likely
to achieve worthwhile results if he
can apply a conventional and precise
stick technique to complicated passages.
Rieger can turn on a crystalline beat,
and when he did the players responded
splendidly. The Sydney Orchestra,
anyway, managed the cleanest playing
of the year under his direction.
Debussy’s “La Mer” at the Sydney
Town Hall was an ideal vehicle for
Mr. Rieger’s style, for the magical
qualities of this score are highlighted
when the details are clearly etched in.
“La Mer” is one of the most
atmospheric pieces Debussy ever wrote,
yet in texture it is one of the least
diffuse. The whole thing is iridescent
yet full of strong, clear lines which,
under Rieger’s direction, flowed
purposefully and coherently.
A tendency to dissect phrases which
had a rather chilling effect in some
of Mr. Rieger’s classical items on pre-
vious occasions, noticeably in the


Fritz Rieger rehearsing ... a conductor
who can turn on a crystalline. beat
“Leonora No. 3,” did not mar the
Beethoven Violin Concerto which was
on the same program as the Debussy.
However, it would be impossible for
any conductor to temper the warmth
of a Szeryng, and I cannot remember
a performance which exceeded this
one in sheer beauty of sound. Beethoven
is so often concerned with storming the
heights that one is inclined to forget
that the Violin Concerto is one of
the most graceful stretches of music
in existence despite the epic architecture
of the first movement. Szeryng never
detracted from the spaciousness of the
work for a moment, but the whole
piece unfolded in an intimate, almost
chamber fashion. This work is the
aristocrat of violin concertos and this
quality was to the fore throughout the
performance.
The cadenza in the first movement
was a breathtaking display of virtuosity
that could possibly be equalled, but
certainly not exceeded, by any other
fiddle player alive. There is something
miraculous about the spectacle of some-
body charging over a stringed instru-
ment with a mixture of velocity and
accuracy which is the product of trans-
cendental co-ordination; and when this
display is allied to a musicianship which
does not diminish the stature of the
work as a whole, the cadenza almost
becomes a focal point.
Also on the program was the Double
Concerto of Bach in which Donald
Hazelwood joined Szeryng. This was
a good, solid performance and the
heavenly polyphony of the slow move-
ment was sensitively woven together by
the soloists. Custom is never likely to
stale the strength and tenderness of
this movement; here is a case where
familiarity breeds content. The outside
movements had a fine, healthy,
al fresco drive about them, although the
orchestral playing was more workman-
like than inspired. All the vigor in the
world cannot compensate for the joy
which should be manifest in playing
Bach.
MUSIC/KAY LUCAS
A PROVOCATIVE MIX
THE TITLE George Dreyfus has given
his latest orchestral piece, which was
given its first performance by the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under
Sir Bernard Heinze on October 29,
seems to have been deliberately designed
to provoke the purist music-lover to a
frenzy of outraged propriety. For,
although the piece is written for sym-
phony orchestra, it is called simply
“Jingles.” To suggest any connection
between the world of commercial music
and the hallowed world of symphonic
art music is to carry outrage to the
point of sacrilege. To discover any con-
nection between the title and the actual
music which would justify a sense of
outrage, however, is quite another
matter. For the piece does not sound
very much like a commercial jingle at
all. Yet, because the title is so provok-
ing, one is led irresistibly to speculate
on the composer’s possible motives in
using it.
In theory, the application of such a
title to such a piece would seem to
indicate a novel solution to the central
problem of contemporary art: that of
creating, or discovering, a style which
is relevant to the situation of our times.
If it is true that most of our life today
takes place against the background of
the* hit-parades, then the attempt to
create a synthesis of the forms and
styles of commercial music and the
inherited techniques of the symphony
must be commended as an attempt to
give a refined and permanent form to
the common speech. The problem with
applying the theory to the piece is that
mentioned earlier: that the music is
highly sophisticated and without its
title would not call up an association
with popular music. Hence, one is forced
to an alternative interpretation.
Many people believe that the artist
who seeks to make contact with the
world should be at pains to preserve
his integrity by rejecting the world’s
values, which are seen as inevitably
corrupt. Here, however, is a composer
who makes a virtue of compromise, who
is less cluttered than most with high-
minded notions about the function of
art and the role of the artist, who has
an instinctive feeling for the market
and a sure sense of what sells. In this
piece he has chosen to abstract from
commercial music those stylistic ele-
ments which would be likely to help him
attain his desired end—a successful
product.
Dreyfus’ style has certain distinctive
features. He knows intuitively that one
way to keep the public interested is to
prevent it ever finding out exactly what
he is up to. His music teases the imagin-
ation with suggestions of this or that
style or mood, and perplexes the mind
by sudden and radical changes of
direction. Here, this waywardness is
controlled by the remorselessly steady
beat he has taken over from pop music.
The appeal of his more lyrical passages
derives from a carefully calculated
blend of sweet (his flair for a good
tune) and sour (his constant tendency
to parody). Here, too, the piece is
saved from excess in either direction
by another borrowed element: all the
movements are very short, none being
longer than a “single” record side. The
denouement is characteristically per-
plexing. A passage for Tijuana brass
introduces the only authentic touch of
the commercial, which “sends up”
everything that has gone before, but is
then in turn put down by the resump-
tion of a more serious manner.
One can only assume, then, that Mr.
Dreyfus, with characteristic irreverence,
has set out to offend those with a will
to be offended, and to give the rest
something good for their money. The
memories of the thunderous applause
which followed his piece must surely
reassure him that he has at least
achieved the latter part of his aim.

WHEN PROPHETS'
VOICES ARE LOUD
IN THE LAND
By NANCY KEESING
The Invasion. John Hay. Hodder &
Stoughton. $3.25.
Day of the Republic. Geoff Taylor.
Peter Davies. $3.50.
THE NEWEST (post-Nevil Shute)
idea in Australian fiction is to speculate
on conditions after an Asian invasion.
Last year it was Kap Pothan’s inter-
esting but amateurish “A Time To Die,”
wherein surviving guerilla bands
struggled against the “Indoasiaris,” suc-
ceeded and prepared to act out old,
pre-invasion conflicts among themselves.
This year, a better, in fact a good, book
is John Hay’s “The Invasion.” Follow-
ing these two in a hypothetical sequence
of events is Geoff Taylor’s “Day of the
Republic.”
John Hay does not describe the first
stages of Australia’s destruction by the
planes and nuclear bombs of the “South-
East Asian Republic” in detail, but
only by rumor and brief sightings by
a family. His group of survivors and
their conquerors keep mainly to the
area of “Four Hills” station, an irriga-
tion and grazing property in western
N.S.W. The period is in the future, but,
perhaps, no more than 20 years hence.
When news of toppling cities comes
to “Four Hills” on the morning radio
news, dramatically cut short by disaster,
the owner, John Stanley-Harris, sends
most of his staff off to seek their fami-
lies, and remains with his Chinese cook,
Chee. Later they are joined by Bezjak,
a European engineer a “new Austra-
lian”; James Empire Lucas, half-caste—
an “old Australian whose CP ticket will
not help him much with the invaders”;
Eddie Burke, a biscuit salesman, with
his wife, Shirl, and small daughter.
Soon the invading army arrives led
by Captain Atmadi (an Indonesian?).
Atmadi is an insecure, sadistic little
veteran. Later again, by a week or so,
comes the Chinese Major Sui Mi-Yan,
a woman irrigation expert whose job
will be to enlarge the existing area of
irrigation in the district so that “Four
Hills,” and neighboring country, can
develop into a food supply for Asia.
Australia, here, is envisaged less as a
depot for population overflows than an
efficient rice bowl.
Hay argues that we, by our casual
and penny-pinching approach to agri-
culture, by our selfish materialism
(symbolised here by Burke), have (20
years hence) sold out our right to our
own country. We could and should have
done voluntarily (and now) what the
Communist-dominated South-East Asian
Republic plans to impose by force.
Each main character in the book
typifies some attitude, some weakness
or strength; but Hay’s achievement is
to depict them not as mere symbols
but as breathing, suffering people.
Atmadi and Eddie Burke are the evil
ones who, fittingly, destroy each other.
But Atmadi is fated to bring down the
Communist dream because of his
defects, at “Four Hills” the various
racial elements among the South-East
Asians drift openly into conflict and
disaster. .
However, the book ends in a disap-
pointing way that suggests a failure of
nerve on its author’s part. Stanley-
Harris and Sui Mi-Yan, always in un-
easy sympathy because both are essen-
tially farmers, together with the preg-
nant Shirl Burke, the child Marcia, the
engineer Bezjak, who has come to terms
with his problems and tragedies, and
Lucas, with his wife and children, sur-
vive after the purging of “Four Hills”
by flood and fire. This group have
reason to be certain that other pockets
of survivors exist on the face of the
changeless countryside and, too, that
“civil war” among the invaders has
been widespread in Australia indeed,
the time of reckoning has been world-
wide.
In Australia, survivors will re-
populate the earth, color will cease to
matter. To me this seems too easy a
solution. It denies the logic of the first
three-quarters of the book, which
suggested some difficult, mutually dis-
tasteful, but eventually productive com-
promise between invaders and invaded.
In very convincing fictional terms the
warning was: if Australia can be made
immensely productive it should be so
made, and immediately. Else we or our
children may be eyewitnesses to Mr.
Hay’s prophetic powers.
“Day of the Republic” purports to be
a more or less eyewitness account, and
a silly book it is. The time is approxi-
mately AD 2000. Australia, now ruled
by the Right-wing Republican Party,
is about to be landed with President Z
fascist dictator if ever there was
one, who, nevertheless, has sold out on
all traditional alliances in favor of a
treaty with Red China. The staff of
the “Unicorn,” Melbourne’s surviving
newspaper, oppose Z and his policies
to the nuclear end.
The “Unicorn” has an incredible net-
work of information sources function-
ing amid chaos, and all at its head-
quarters know of a plot to assassinate
Z, that the armed services are briefed
for total war, that fleets of unidentified
submarines surround the Australian
coast, that all foreign shipping is steam-
ing hastily out to sea, that America is
withdrawing her nationals and friends
by air, etc., etc. Despite all this, every-
one, from their hasty summoning to a
7 a.m. conference onwards, is surprised
by each new happening and gets through
the day in a welter of high-minded
determination and starry-eyed wonder.
SOMETIMES LUDICROUS
By JOHN BAXTER
Airport. Arthur Hailey. Michael Joseph
Souvenir Press. $4.10.
“AIRPORT” HAS been on top of the
American best-seller list for more than
six months and shows no sign of stir-
ring, a fact which must be a source of
great joy to Arthur Hailey and his
publishers, especially since it has just
been announced that “Airport,” like
the same author’s “Hotel,” will shortly
be filmed with the obligatory all-star
cast. Having already had one airport
melodrama in “The VIPs,” I imagined
that this theme had been thoroughly
worked out, but apparently the public
is anxious to view further insights into
the romantic world of commercial
aviation as it is to read them.
Like “The VIPs,” not to mention
“The Prize,” “The Games,” and other
novels giving the inside story of great
events, “Airport” uses a series of stories
to show the complexity of a modern
American air terminal. Some of the
stories are trivial; a lost food truck
stranded in a snowstorm at the edge of
the field, a group of nearby residents
campaigning in the main passenger
hall about excessive noise from low-
flying jets. But most concern the well-
being of the star Golden Argosy flight
on its way to Italy, taking with it a
stewardess pregnant by the captain, a
stowaway, and a suicidal malcontent
with a bomb in his bag.
Focus for the story and the man
who passes for hero is Mel Bakersfeld,
the Airport Manager, who has troubles
with his wife, an oversexed social
climber who spends portion of Chapter
6 in bed with a reporter she meets at
a party. He also has to face a brother
on the edge of suicide, a blossoming
affair with one of his associates, and
the usual problems of airport manage-
ment, culminating in a plane stranded
in the snowstorm across a vital run-
way. What with the blizzard, his love-
life, an old war wound, the larger prob-
lems of the future of civil aviation, and
a mad bomber on the loose, Mel’s life
is an uninterrupted procession of Those
Days, and in the end, when the prob-
lems are solved in time for the dawn,
one can’t help feeling that only divine
intervention could have made it all
come out right.
Not that criticism of an unlikely plot
is valid in a case like this. Hailey, faced
with the problem of conveying the
romance, the drama, and the comedy of
a big airport, has done an excellent job,
developing his plots with complete con-
sistency and a logic that defies penetra-
tion. Unlike most writers of this type
of novel, he has chosen the least easy
of all development patterns, preferring
to bring all the plot threads together
at one point rather than merely tell a
series of parallel stories which end in
half a dozen brief climactic vignettes
in the final chapter. True, he had to
bend logic in a few places, but the
result is worth this small cheat.
Given the ingenuity of the plot, it’s


a pity that Hailey has not been equally
imaginative in ■ his dialogue. One
sympathises with his problem, that of
conveying large chunks of information
that are vital to the plot and which
can only be said by one person to
another, but Harold Robbins usually
solves the problem and Hailey might
have learned from him. As it is, the
effect in “Airport” is sometimes
ludicrous. Halfway through an intimate
chat with his prospective lover, Bakers-
feld delivers a lecture on airport ex-
pansion which, in context, is quite
hilarious. “Mostly the building going on
is patchwork . . . There are excep-
tions Los Angeles is one; Tampa,
Florida, and Dallas-Fort Worth are
others . . . Kansas City, Houston, and
Toronto look good; San Francisco has
a plan, though it may get sunk politi-
cally . . .” Next slide, please.
“Airport” provides, however, a good
deal of fascinating information about
live lobsters flown from America to
Scotland, there to be sold as “fresh
local seafood”; about the corner-cutting
policies of airlines on baggage damage
and stowaways accept the cost and
be damned; about the resistance of
pilot unions to on-the-spot flight insur-
ance sales which appear to encourage
the mass murder of the bomb suicide.
One also assumes that his details are
accurate of the plans run by airlines
to terminate the pregnancies of un-
married stewardesses, or to arrange
comfortable confinement and adoption
for the children before taking the girl
back on the job.

village priest, goes to Beirut to claim
an inherited “family business” and in-
stead of the anticipated corner grocer’s
with rows of nicely packaged goods
finds she is the owner of an accredited
brothel with a row of gaudily gift-
wrapped girls displayed for her
inspection.
After Emilie’s initial recoil of horror,
her little white conscience begins to
perform prodigious elastic feats, gradu-
ally tempered with handy self-serviced
bedtime stories like that of Mary Mag-
dalene, who comes out of the Bible a
little differently from the way Emilie
chooses to put her in. And so she hap-
pily attempts to corrupt her own inno-
cence, not for cake for herself but for
daily bread for her children’s future,
hoarding the mailed profits from the
abominable Madam against her son’s
education and her unattractive
daughter’s more attractive dowry.
Naturally, it is a good deed that
finds her out how true to life. The
scandal finally breaks through an
impulsive gift of a suspiciously
unaccountable sum to an unsavory but
destitute family. Emilie, who had started
by lighting a timid match, ends by
burning down her whole way of life.
Yet there is more to “The Right
Hand” than just a colorful and exotic
background. Without preaching or
proselytising, Nicole Vidal turns over
for the reader’s inspection the whole
topsy-turvy business of saints and
sinners and how to tell the difference,
which should make any but the most
cursory line-skimmer think again. How-
ever, moralists will also be satisfied:
Emilie reaps nothing but suffering; her
gentle husband dies as a burnt offering
to appease the scandalmongers, her
lumpy daughter spurns her dowry and
flees to a convent, and her son is packed
off to an American uncle to escape the
uproar.
But, strangely, the Emilie who is
abandoned and alone at the end of
the novel is not a worse person but a
better one, wiser, more tolerant, and
more understanding. It is the “good”
people, those who had cast the first and
the last stones, who remain tightly
wrapped in their cloaks of selfrighteous-
ness in which they have left no room
for what they like to call their Christian
charity.
Nicole Vidal employs a light, some-
times wryly humorous touch that can
take sudden and unexpected plunges
into deeper waters. As always, her prose
is both elegant and eloquent, eminently
readable without blazoning any new
paths or indeed even wishing to do so.
Somewhere, the author still retains that
faintly perfumed, once-removed, other-
worldly atmosphere of her previous
historical novels like the ancient
Egyptian “Nefertiti,” or the ancient
Chinese “Ring of Jade,” combined with
a modern-dress realism and a fine sense
of characterisation.
“The Right Hand” would make an
ideal Christmas gift for a female
relative or friend who likes something
a bit different, with a take-it-or-leave-it
message. It is a cut above the ordinary
woman’s mag. happy-ever-afters, but
still a fairly escapist sort of entertain-
ment without too many highbrow
literary hurdles to scale.
REQUIEM FOR A RACE
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Selected Poems. Nelly Sachs. Jonathan
Cape. $7.35.
NELLY SACHS, the co-recipient of
the 1966 Nobel Prize for literature, is
now in her 77th year. In 1940, after
having lived in isolation in Germany
for some years, she fled to Sweden with
her mother. A Jewess, Miss Sachs
watched with anguish the genocide of
her people by the Nazis, and in 1946
published her first collection of poetry,
“In the Habitations of Death.”
This volume, and other works which
followed, are a major achievement in
20th-century poetry. They are gathered
together here in a selection with a
bilingual text. These are poems built
from the ashes of her people, with
words calcined in the agony of innocent
victims. The subject matter of the
earlier poems in the volume is horrible
and fearsome, and yet the poems them-
selves rise from this horror magnificent,
proud, and resplendent.
Major poetry must be more than mere
verbal pyrotechnics, it must be felt.
Miss Sachs is a great master of
language, but more than that, these
poems are deeply felt in every sinew
and nerve end. It is perhaps the irony
of history that, without the destruction
of her people, Miss Sachs may never
have been driven back on herself, as
she was, to find the language for this
requiem for a race.
I, at first, aproached her poetry with
some reservations. There is a great deal
Nelly Sachs ... a late developer
of poetry and literature written about
Buchenwald and the other murder
camps, and there is a tendency for
some writers to look for emotional
capital by quoting death statistics and
catalogues of torture.
Nelly Sachs is light years away from
this type of emotional parisitism. These
poems are a dreadful indictment of the
Nazis, but she is not content merely
to indict. Even in her darkest moments
she is driven to praise and celebrate
the fact of life. Murder and death are
horrible because life is precious. Nelly
Sachs does not introduce notions of
false heroism or morality to counter-
balance the horror of genocide. Life is
not worth while merely because of such

simplistic notions, it is precious because
it is a mystery, for no reason: it is what
she calls “a glowing enigma.”
In the verse play “Eli,” which con-
cludes this selection of her poetry, it
is significant that when Eli, an eight-
year-old child, sees the Nazis carting
his parents away through the Cattle
Lane, he blows wildly on his pipe to
God and high heaven. A soldier turns
around to see the child blowing on his
pipe and strikes him dead with his
rifle butt. In the moment of absolute
terror and nausea there is exultation and
defiance.
I quote the whole of a very remark-
able poem entitled “Numbers” to
illustrate these aspects of her work:
When your forms turned to ashes
into the oceans of night
where eternity washes
life and death into the tides
there rose the numbers
(once branded into your arms
so none would escape the agony)
there rose meteors of numbers
beckoned into the spaces
where light-years expand like arrows
and the planets
are born
of the magic substances of pain
numbers root and all
plucked out of murderers’ brains
and part already
of the heavenly cycle’s
path of blue veins.
The theme of the poem is that the
very numbers which the Nazis branded
on the arms of Jews in concentration
camps have now turned against the
Nazis, who invented the idea. These
numbers have now risen up against the
Nazis as a terrible indictment with the
death of the 6,000,000. The “heavenly
cycle’s path of blue veins” is the human
brain as well as the sky. It is typical of
Nelly Sachs’ poetry that she should see
the brain and the sky as two inter-
changeable objects because the brain
can contain the sky.
It is an example of the theme of
metamorphosis which recurs in her
work. The whole universe is organic, it
is undergoing continual transforma-
tions. Different things are constantly
interchanging. The planets are born out
of pain and become the human brain.
Poetry is often seen as the feverish
by-product of young men drowning
themselves in their own midnight oil,
young Rimbauds who burn themselves
out in an auto-da-fe of language and
then retire taciturn to Africa. There is
a fair bit of truth in this view. But
there is another side to the story.
There are also late developers such
as Edwin Muir and Nelly Sachs, who
begin hesitantly and only find their own
voice in middle-age or later. These
poets are often the most impressive.
There is a dignity and restraint about
their work. One feels with them that
they are concerned more with human
lives than with words. Language has

been adopted as an implement to
express their deepest emotions, rather
than emotions being invented to display
their command of language. Muir, with
his feeling for the Bible and the hard,
cold light of his native Orkneys, is per-
haps closer to the feel of Nelly Sachs
than any other modern English poet.
This is possibly also because Muir
spent many years translating German,
and Miss Sachs writes in German. In
the loftiness of her language and her
free, unrhymed forms (which never,
however, waver in their control), she is
influenced most strongly by Holderlin.
She belongs to a line of noble, heroic
verse going back to Pindar, which the
English tradition has largely missed out
on.
I remember James McAuley at a
lecture once saying that free verse works
in German but not in English. I feel
his statement was not altogether accur-
ate, as there is a great deal of free verse
in English which does work despite the
strictures of Hope and McAuley. There
are reasons, however, why free verse
works more easily in German than in
English. In German all vowel sounds
are enunciated clearly and do not lose
their original color, even when unac-
cented. In English there is a tendency
for all unaccented vowels to become
the amorphous neutral vowel of “the.”
English is more limply enunciated than
German, and consequently more control
must be exercised in English to make
sure that the words sing.
In addition, the German habit of
inversion introduces variety and shifting
emphasis. English as an uninflected
language cannot play around with word
order too much and has to obtain
stress or emphasis by devices such as
an unexpected pause in a poem in
regular metre. In addition, German
frequently puts the verb at the end
of a clause or sentence. As the verb is
generally the most important word in
a sentence, this means that a German
sentence is often building up to a peak
at its conclusion, with a verb, while the
same sentence in English may be dying
away on a noun. I mention this because
these factors are at work in these trans-
lations of Nelly Sachs’. The translators
are Michael Hamburger, Christopher
Holme, Ruth and Matthew Mead, and
Michael Roloff. As is suitable in a
bilingual text, they stress accuracy
rather than brilliance.
Cauterised into major poetry by the
death of a race, Nelly Sachs has written
some of the most memorable poetry
of this century about life and death.
Few lines could be more eloquent than
these lines from “Landscape of
Screams”:
O hieroglyphs of screams
engraved at the entrance gate to
death.

SOMETHING NEW WITH
Graham Kerr
OUR MEAT PIE HAS
A FAMOUS
CANADIAN COUSIN
“TELL ME ...” I said to the barber,
settling down for a pleasant chat,
“. . . are you French-Canadian or were
you born in France?”
He drew the neckband in with a
sharp jerk. “I’m-a-Italian!”
And so I entered Canadian life with
real international aplomb.
Of all countries in the English-
speaking world, Canada, in my opinion,
is closest to Australia. Vast and under-
populated, it has our rapid growth and
enormous potential. Populated basically
by French and Anglo-Saxons, it now
has large Italian and middle-European
workforces, with the usual problems of
assimilation.
The standard of living is regarded
as slightly better than ours, because of
the higher wages and the proximity of
American competition. Where we suffer
from drought and desert, Canada
suffers from flood and snow. What we
gain from growing tropical fruits,
Canada picks up with excellent fish
and shellfish. But, otherwise, on the
food scene there is little to tell us
apart.
Canadians en masse are vitally inter-
ested in food, especially in dishes
generally regarded as “complicated.”
This may in part be due to the cold
weather periods when food is an
essential foil against the elements and
the kitchen a warm, hospitable, and
friendly place.
A more reasonable assumption, how-
ever, is that Canada, like the United
States, has had a bellyfull of “con-
venience living” they have, so to
speak, “grown accustomed to their
taste” and they are bored by it all.
By “convenience” I refer largely to
the packet foods that line their super-
markets. Practically everything that was
once homemade is now bottled, canned,
pre-cooked and frozen, or freeze-dried.
Canada, like Australia, has few in-
digenous dishes. As Dr. Garnet T. Page,
Canada’s foremost gourmet, told me,
“Our pioneer country has been busy
developing itself in many ways. Not
until it reaches full maturity with wealth
and adequate leisure can it turn aside
to the task of pursuing the sensuality
of feasting and related entertainment.
In short,” he said, “to achieve haute
cuisine we must first have a haute
bourgeoisie. Then this class, with time
and money to spend, may be expected
to turn to the serious business of enter-
taining themselves, and in so doing
might perchance develop a distinctive
cuisine based on the common cookery
of the country, garnished with every-
thing that appealed to them in their
travels abroad.
“But a nation must be very old and
mellow when it reaches this stage. We
have not yet arrived at it, and have
not the mighty kitchens, built at
fabulous expense, merely to titillate
jaded appetites. With our rapid growth,
our relatively large immigration, and
our native vigor, we have not synthe-
sised effectively our many elements into
a more or less homogeneous group,
from which might arise a distinctive
type of cookery which woidd warrant
the stamp ‘Canadian,’ ” Mr. Page said.
Much the same can be said for
Australia’s “typical” food.
The one food which most relates the
two countries is the meat pie that
great Australian dish. Canadians, too,
have their national pie. It is called a
Tourtiere or Pate de Noel, and among
French-speaking Canadians is the
traditional attraction at the reveillon
which follows midnight mass on
December 24.
I have, as you know, a great interest
in national dishes, and I tracked down
no fewer than four different recipes for
this famous pie. I also found a recipe
for one of the best ragout dishes I’ve
ever eaten. It is called Ragout
Canadien, and the people of the Gaspe
area of Quebec serve it in place of the
Tourtiere.
LE RAGOUT CANADIEN:
Two lb. chopped round steak, 51b.
chopped fresh pork, 21b. lean fresh
pork, 2 pigs feet, 1 41b. chicken or 1
piece lean beef, 2 large onions, 2 cups
browned flour, J teaspoon each sage,
thyme, marjoram, and crumbled bay-
leaf.
Chop one onion finely, mix with
chopped meat and seasonings. Roll in
balls, roll in flour, fry in shortening in
iron frying pan. Cut chicken in quarters,
roll in flour, and fry in shortening. Boil
pigs feet and pork, with whole onion
and spices in a muslin bag, in ten quarts
of water slowly, until tender. Salt and
pepper to taste. Add browned flour and
boil one hour, stirring occasionally. Add
balls of meat and fried chicken and
simmer another hour. Serve hot.

Grassroots defence of
Canberra
As one who has grown to love the
beauty of Canberra over the years and
the glory of spring and autumn colors
(including purple prunus!) I whole-
heartedly disagree with Jane and Allen
Correy in “How to Naturalise Can-
berra” (8., October 26). Most of the
article is baloney. While there is plenty
that is mediocre and unimaginative in
Canberra architecture, a similar charge
levelled at the layout and choice of
plantings just won’t stick. To take two
examples what Australian native
trees with anything approaching the
seasonal beauty of, say, prunus or pin
oak are suitable for the Canberra
climate? And as for “experimenting
with groundcover planting to reduce
. . . unused and useless grass,” what
piffle! Have the authors ever tried
eating their sandwiches off, playing
footie with the kids on, or just plain
walking across “groundcover planting”?
And, anyway, isn’t the smell of newly
mown grass almost a birthright? The
tone of the article is carping, naive, and
verging on the chauvinistic.
A.G.L. Paine
Red Hill, A.C.T.
My husband hasn’t said half of it
in his protest on the Canberra article
(8., October 26).
Please give Parks and Gardens the
credit for knowing the conditions under
which they plant this city. Have your
journalists ever looked at any early
paintings of the district before Canberra
was built? Parks and Gardens has
experimented with and introduced
natives as well as exotics suitable to
this area. Surely both native and exotic
trees have their own different values
in landscape work. I might also point
out that the longevity of a tree is an
important factor in street-planting.
I am keeping calm.
Prostrate groundcover plants are
used by the National Development
Commission, but they are simply not a
substitute for lawn for biking, lying-
on-under-trees, or walking walking!
You have to wade through most ground-
cover plants.
If those wretched journalists had
ever sat on City Hill in the evening,
they would have been very surprised
at the birdlife literally thousands of
birds roost there till those funereal
conifers and other exotics are swaying
with their weight.
Your journalists say that the chal-
lenges of landscaping should not be left
exclusively to the NDC designers that
outside stimulus is healthy. Do they
know that overseas designers have land-
scaped the Children’s Gardens and
open-air theatre and Marsh Gardens in
Constitution Avenue?
I have learnt to love and know trees
after living here —I have been made
aware of their habit and character and
the many varieties within a species, and
am jolly grateful.
Just one more thing—you don’t like
purple prunus —l do, and I live here.
They seem well chosen, they’re hardy,
provide a week of avenues of showy
blossom which is a joy after a cold
winter. They flower early enough to miss
our spring winds as a rule. They are
well-shaped shade trees even if you
don’t like the foliage contrast and -—-
dare I say it? plums for jam.

Red Hill, A.C.T.
[The article “How to Naturalise Can-
berra” (8., October 26) appeared
originally in the magazine “Architecture
in Australia” under the heading “The
landscape treatment of Canberra.” By
an oversight this accreditation was not
given.]
Dutton shot down
I refer to “Dutton Flies High and
Really Makes It” (8., October 19).
This critique caused me to spend $3.60
on a book titled “Andy,” which I now
regard as a total loss, and am sorely
tempted to forward it to reviewer Nancy
Keesing with the kind of advice as to
its placement that “Andy” would be
happy to offer.
Antiquated stories and a large number
of four-letter words will not take the
place of the genuine, spontaneous dry-
wit of the Aussie serviceman. Years ago,
Dutton should have flown high, and
in ever-decreasing circles, and so spared
us this odd yarn of things that never
were.

"Fortress Australia"
Having digested the phrases “forward
defence” and “defence in depth,” we
are now being served with an alternative
to be known as “continental,” or “con-
tinent,” defence. Rightly or wrongly, this
latter phrase is considered to be an
interpretation of the Prime Minister’s
thoughts on defence. But, on reading
“Drifting Again” (B.,'October 26), one
gets the impression that this is merely
a euphemism for “Fortress Australia,”
a term which conjures up visions of a
beleaguered garrison surrounded by foes.
Australia is a unique continent in
that it is occupied by only one nation
and, far from being surrounded by foes,
is surrounded by the sea. Hence, it is
of supreme importance that the sea
should be friendly to us and hostile to
our enemies.
Defence in depth does not necessarily
mean locking up our slender manpower
as garrisons in foreign countries. It can,
and should, be provided by the use of
sea power, including its air component.
An Australian Government which is not
sea-minded is not truly nation-minded.

People for Violence
We have just read your unfounded,
vicious attack on “People For Violence”
in your magazine (8., October 19).
Viewed in connection with your 19th-
century anti-semitism, anti-Chinese, and
anti-working-class atrocities which are
Rightest in both form and essence, how
can one not be wide awake?
Dear friends and readers, be not hood-
winked by these slanders.
Following your attack, we will raise
still higher our red banner of Power for
the People and the Working Class.
Once again dark clouds blot out the

incited by the puppet Gorton clique,
but we shall smash it.

Too soft in Vietnam?
It’s all very well for “Observer” (8.,
November 2) to sit there congratulating
himself that the next President is going
to “de-Americanise” the Vietnam War.
To my mind that is just a smart way
of saying we are going to lose. The
Americans were too soft in Vietnam,
as they have been too soft on Com-
munism in other parts of the world.
Why couldn’t they have used their un-
doubted material superiority? They
could have blockaded Haiphong and
called the Russians’ bluff a good
time to have done this was during the
Czech crisis. Perhaps they should have
gone further. They could have reduced
Hanoi to rubble. With their strength
that would have taken them only a
few afternoons.

Suddenly, Carter Brown
“The first requirement in making a
film is a script,” says Denis O’Brien in
“Suddenly, a film industry” (8., October
19), but many visiting movie-makers
suggest the first requirement is a “prop-
erty,” by which they mean a good script
or, better still, a well-known and widely
popular book, from which a strong
script could be written. This is how the
American film industry operates, auto-
matically turning best-sellers into films.
First up, you might conclude Australia
has no best-selling novels left to offer
now that “Weird Mob” has been filmed.
Could I nominate the Carter Brown
paperbacks? Just about everyone in my
age group reads them, and though the
heroes have different names they’re
always the same man. Why not call him
Carter Brown and make a movie about
him?
