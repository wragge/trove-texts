regret that they have been unable to fulfil
many orders (amoimting in the aggregate to
at least 16,000 copies) for extra supplies of
the Christmas Number of “The Bulletin."
The demand was so unprecedentedly great that,
although the Christmas edition was larger
than in any former year, the supply fell so far
short of requirements that the entire number
had been sold out by half-past six o'clock on
the morning of publication, copies being dis
posed of by retail vendors on the following day
at at least double the published price.
For the information of readers and adver-
tisers, it mag he men tioned that 9350 copies of
“ The Bulletin’s ” Christmas Number were
sent to Queensland alone on firm order, and
that just on 13,000 extra copies were ordered in
advance by Victorian agents, many of whom
have since unavailingly wired for further sup-
plies. As an illustration of the widespread
character of “ The Bulletin’s” circulation, it
may be stated that 5800 copies were taken by
New Zealand, over 2f00 by Tasmania, and
1100 by Western Australia; that a South
African Agent wrote two months since remit-
ting the money for 200 copies of “ The Bulle-
tin” Ghrismas edition fur sale among the
Australian miners on thelocal goldfields; and
that ISO copies are sold weekly by a single Lon-
don agent. Not a copy of “ The Bulletin’’
Christmas Number is now procurable in any
quarter —a statement which cannot be made in
regard to the special edition published by any
other weekly paper. On the day after publica-
tion the Sydney Bookstall Co., whose first sup-
ply was 2900 copies, had sold out, and applied
for 800 additional copies, which could not be
obtained. These are square, solid facts, cap-
able of verification.

The Future Rulers of the World.
The undoubted fact that the world’s dry
land amounts to about fifty-three million
square miles and the world’s population to
nearly fourteen-hundred millions of people,
is in no way surprising. Or, at least, if it
surprises at all, it is by reason of the great
extent of the ground and the small number
of the inhabitants. With a little less than
twenty-seven people to the square-mile, a
little more than twenty-four acres for each
mauj woman, and child would seem to be
the present allowance. Say that one-sixth of
this amount—a pretty wide margin—was
unsuited for cultivation either through
northern snows or tropic sands, there would
still remain twenty acres for each person
now above ground. Considering the
numbers who in various countries have to
derive their sustenance from a single acre, it
is not too much to say that the present
population of the earth is absurdly below
the globe’s carrying capacity. It is not,
however, with this suggestive fact we have
here to deal. The time is rapidly ap-
proaching when men will pause to think —
they are doing so here and there already—
how it comes that, on a planet capable of
supporting in comfort twenty times its pre-
sent population, the great bulk of those now
upon it are doomed to wearing work while
the cunning few have but to play, with a
fair prospect of having a sempiternal frolic
in the world to come. This, after all, is the
great issue forcing itself daily to the front—
why A, who ecus nothing, and is incapable
of doing anything useful, should not only
live well but actually govern B, who works
his lingers off and his soul out merely to sup ■
port A in inglorious idleness. It may be that
A can explain, can show how necessary he is
in Nature’s economy, just as the stomach
proved its usefulness in the body ; but, so
far, it must be admitted that he has never
tried to do so, or has failed ignomuiously
when he attempted the task.
* » *
What we have now to deal with is the state-
ment, made in a recent issue of a London
paper, that, in a few years (bar accidents),
one-third of the world’s dry land, and nearly
a third of its people, will be governed by the
grandchildren of the present King of Den-
mark. This monarch, it will be remembered,
stands unrivaUed as a matchmaker. One of
his daughters is Empress of Russia, while
another— Tennyson’s “ Sea King’s daughter
from over the sea”—would be England's
Queen should anything unfortunately occur
to cause-a vacancy. King Christian’s son,
too, rules the Hellenes, and, long ere this,
has, no doubt, considered how neatly A 1
bania and Macedonia would round off his
dominions on the north should the final
struggle for the sick man’s fast-disappearing
heritage occur during his regime. Chris-
tian himself is sovereign of a little peninsula
which, with its tiny neighbour, Holland,
may possibly disappear when next the Ger-
man mastiff opens his hungry jaws. Life, in
either of these small countries, must be un-
comfortable whenever M. Bismarck has a
bad night’s rest. Denmark and Greece,
then, may be left out of the reckoning, for,
even should they preserve their indepen-
dence, their territories and their populations
are so small that no account need be taken
of them. It is to England and to Russia
we must look in trying to estimate the
chances of Christian’s grandsons becoming
King of the one and Emperor of the other.
# # •
To start with Russia. The present ruler
of that mighty Empire is so secure upon his
throne, and so enshrined in the hearts of his
people, that every street through which he
drives requires to be lined with troops,
every house he passes occupied by infantry.
When he undertakes a railway-journey to
appear in person at the ancient seat of his
Empire, every conduit and tunnel has to be
searched, every furlong of the route guarded
by vigilant Cossacks; while, that nothing
may be left undone to tliow bis confidence
in his faithful subjects, half-a dozon dummy
trains, with dummy Czars looking pleasantly
from dummy state carriages, reduce the risk
to a minimum. In none of the principal
streets of his metropolis dare he appear ex-
cept in the centre of a battalion, that, in its
turn, is surrounded with police spies, who,
dressed as peasants, receive their “Little
Father ” with a filial demonstrativeness at
once genuine and touching. Nowhere in his
vast Empire is his person free from
outrage except when surrounded by
chevaux-de-frise of lances. Nor are things
much better when he remains in
the bosom of his family. For him all the
pleasant associations connected with the
word “ home ” have no meaning. His
palace Is a fortress few are allowed to
approach. He is a prisoner, not a ruler, in
his own country. Yet, in spite of all the
precautions taken for his safety, threatening
letters fall from the folds of his serviette at
table, warning missives find their way under
his pillow. A few months ago—so the
generally-credited report goes—he arrested
the approach of a high court official by Buf-
falo Bill’s effective plan of sending a bullet
through him. The officer’s manner did not
please the Czar, so, to prevent any unplea-
santness, the latter wisely adopted the
Colorado system of getting the lead on first.
Nothing approaching in grim ludicrousntss
the everyday life of the ruler of all the
Russias has been seen in Europe since
Louis XI. barricaded himself in the castle
of Piesais, or, nearly two hundred years sub-
sequently, Cromwell changed his bedroom
every night after having perused Colonel
Titus’s famous pamphlet “Killing no Mur-
der.” Considering everything, then, the
chances in favour of the Romanoffs long con-
tinuing on the Muscovite throne are not
very encouraging. Within the last few
months the Emperor’s advisers, dreading
the levelling doctrines leavening the mind
of “ Young Russia,” have made a decided'
attempt to roll back the tide of freedom by
proscribing education. They say, and say
t ru’y, what English divines have preached
for centuries, that knowledge has a tendency
to make persons dissatisfied with the station
of life “ in which it has pleased Gon to
place them.” Our eighteenth century pas-
tors ascended in droves the back-stairs of
St. James’s to pour into courtesans’ laps the
money to buy bishoprics. Having secured
mitres by their conspicuous learning and
piety, their next step was to impress on
their flocks the heinousness of desiring to
rise above the position in which an All-Wise
Creator had fixed them. It is the same in
Russia at this moment. The monarch, the
aristocrat, and the priest, the three great
enemies of mankind, have taken fright at
the thought of the young Slav’s thirst for
knowledge and have cut off the supply. But
they dallied too long—they should have
begun earlier. Enough good seed has now
been sown over Muscovy from the Arctic
Circle to the Crimea, to materially lessen
the chances for King Christian’s grandson.

Let us turn to England. British mon-
archists have much to Le thankful Lr. But,
above all, have they to thank the kind fate
which gave a daughter instead of a son to the
Duke of Kent on that May morning in 1819.
The accession of a female alone saved the
Monarchy from the contempt into which the
five proceeding reigns had brought it. It
may, of course, be said that nothing con'd
wreck an institution which even the bestial
Georges and the meriy-andraw William
could not destroy. Signs were not wanting,
however, that another sovereign or two like
the fourth and fifth Guelph would have
brought the patient British people to con-
sider whether even the Creator was justified
in always choosing such instruments to work
out His inscrutable designs. It was the
appearance of a young and virtuous female
upon the throne that did so much to mend
legitimacy’s crutch. But there is a wide-
spread impression among those best compe-
tentto give an opinion that, cn the retircm-.nt
or decease of cur present gracious Sovereign,
the institution which owes to her so much
will bs asked to show cause why afresh lease
should be granted to it. The persons res-
ponsible for the foregoing opinion, coincide
in thinking that the Prince of Wales may
succeed in reaching the apex of the political
fabric, but that, whether hiareign is destined
to be shoro or long, it would le pretty safe
to prognosticate a very short one, or none at
all for his weak-minded son, the grandson of
King Christian, Dcuing what ia called the
Victorian era men have travelled far and
fast. The delicacy that prompts them to
ignore the old-world absurdities of a Court
wl o i presided over by an elderly lady, wo aid,
in these days, quietly give way in presence of
a Court where a middle-aged or a young man
was Sultan.
» * *
Ths character of that ascetic personage, the
Prince of Wales, ia now fairly well-known
to the British people. Notwithstanding
that he stands so deservedly high as a man
of absolutely pure morals, it would be folly
to ignore the fact that he ia not so strong on
the intellectual side—in a word, that he is
not a profound man. From what ia known
of hia eldest son, too, the opinion is becom-
ing general that his contribution to the
stream of European intellect will not cause
it to overflow. The question, then, that will
probably press for solution about the time
of the next coronation will be, “ Do we, the
British people, get the worth of our money ?
Assuming that a monarch Is necessary, would
It not be possible to procure a betti r article
at a cheaper price?” Even should this
question not become unduly prominent when
the next occasion arises for the A rchbishop
of Canterbury to use the coronation chrism,
it will certainly come forward with a bound
on the subsequent occasion. Men, in fact,
are beginning to sea that if monarchs are re-
markable at all it ia in being, as a rule,
rather inferior to the average man. It is
when once firmly convinced of this that the
question naturally arises, “Why not ob-
tain the best sample instead of putting up
with an inferior one ? Why give half-a-millicn
a year to a young man who could guide a
cab much better than an Empire, when
trained and mature statesmen can be obtaioed
for a few thousands ? ” If there is anything
more delightfully humorous than to see a
young man with a vacuous face and a slant
ing forehead, whose proper place is in the cor
set department of a drapery store, engaged
in holding the balance between the great
contending parties in a mighty State, we have
not heard of it. Compared with this mammoth
joke the best efforts of these pests of society,
comic writers, are commonplace and dull.
« * •
From what has been said it would appear as
if the grandsons of the astute Christian are
by no means sure of coming in fir the r third
share of the earth’s surface. Indeed, in the
language of the stable, the odds are
considerably against them. So far, at all
events, as England and her ctlomes are
concerned, the time is almost ripe for a
governmental change in the direction of
common-sense. It is quite time that people
who, when they require to take a journey by
rail, insist on having all the at U ions en route
closed to the public, should be turned ad rife
to make an honest living in some humble
sphere for which they are adapted. Thefuture
rulers of the world will be neither Guelph nor
Romanoff, Hapsburg nor Bohenzollern,
but intelligent andmatare men of goodreport,
chosen periodically by the people to carry
out the latter’s wishes. Two of the greatest
nations, one in the Eastern Hemisphere and
the other in the Western, have already
grown out of that abject state of mind that
sees nothing humiliating in clothing a vulgar
or ignorant man or woman with the attri-
butes of a god. And, surely, the time is
almost at hand when Swinburne’s famous
lines, slightly altered, will become a cosmo-
politan anthem :
“ Clear the way, my Sires and Madames,
You have had your day.”
Australia Feeds Corruption.
“ I find the air very salubrious,” said Lady Car-
teret to Swift shortly after her arrival in Ireland.
“Don’t let the Government hear you say so,
madam” answered the Dean, “or they 11 tax it.”
And such was ever the wont of British
Governments, for the British tax-payer has
alwajs been an excellent milch cow, dull,
bovine, submissive, lactescent. Of late, how-
ever, he has made some stir. A Civil
Service Commission has been issued to
inquire into the extravagant expenditure of the
Departments of State. Just fancy! The little
games of the aristocratic permanent officials rudely
inquired into! It is too shocklrg! Among the
departments thus op ned to investigation, it will
be found, if the Commission does its work honestly,
which is doubtful, that the particular department
!n which jobber y, corruption, waste, mismanage-
mcnt, incapacity and wholesale swindling have
reached high-water mark is the Admiralty.
Lord Randolph Churchill, “ the aristocratic,
democratic, acrobatic’ statesman, having fallen
into a su k recently wilh his party, played a
scurvy trick upon them by telling tales out of
school. In a smart speech -for he Is a clever little
chap, al! hough he is a lord-he told the open mouthed
British tax-payer some secrets about the Navy.
His revelations amoun’ed to this: that millions
on millions of pounds sterling, voted during many
years past for the construction of ships of war
and the materials to furnish them with, after pay-
ing a liberal toll to the aristocratic managers of
the Department, were muddled away upon designs
and plans which proved to be hopelessly unwork-
able and useless. The Government dockyards, in
consequence, are littered with curbing cutlasses,
guns that bu st, shells i.hat refuse to burst, fuse
that won’t work, elecirical appliances that go
wrong, gear of various kiids that has no earthly
use, all produced at outrageous expense, accord-
ing to plana and designs farn’sbed by the sons,
sons-in-law, unelcs and cousirs of my lord the
Karl and his grace tbe Duke.
* * *
And then the accounts ha gave of the great
ironclads, produced at the ccst of half-a-million
a-piece, and subsequently requiring another
quarter of a million or so to make them seaworthy
in calm weather ; they made the B. T. draw in
bis breath and feel as if there was an earthquake.
It was pi Table to see the anxiety with which the
poor wretch awaited the results of the “ Jewbiily”
review of the ravy, and more pitiable still a
hundred times to hear his crow of flabby triumph
when all passed off with only the bursting of a
steam-pipe, which mangled half-a-dozen marines.
Why, he actually turned upon little Randy, and
expostulated with him for his rash statements
[N.B.—The Royal Navy was at anchor during ihe
entire review, and the weather was calm.] The
First Lord of the Admiralty, however, was not so
cock-a-whoop as the B T., when questioned in the
House of Commons. On the contrary, like Uriah
Heap, he was very ’umble. He admitted the truth
of. Churchill's statements . But more astonish-
ing still, he subsequently confessed (under pres-
sure) that he was powerless to put an end to this
intolerable state of things in the Department of
which he was the head, owing to the Influence of
‘ the families concerned.’’ The British Admiralty
is rim in the Interests of—England ! Psha, no !
In the interests of “ the families concerned ” —the
noble lords who dance at State balls and lavish
laces and jewels on their women, while hunger
withers the vitals of the children of Demos.
• * »
Although the B.T. is calmer on the matter of
naval expenditure since the Jubilee “triumph,”
one never knows when he will cut up rough again,
and perhaps refuse supplies ; and as it Is a wise
plan to make provision for the rainy day, the
noble lords, with careful forethought, do so charac-
teristically. They cast their eyes upon Australia,
young, rich, ignorant of “official” ways, and at
once they see their chance of doing a clever stroke
of business. A few snob-statesmen nobbled, the
‘' loyalty ” crank turned on, some polite despatches
from the Colonial Office, and the thing is done.
Australia sends her goodi od gold to be sweated first
and then muddled away by “the famiiies con-
cerned,” and in return sfce gets a few more de-
crepit hulks like the Nelson which notoriously
cannot weather with safety even half a gale !
it * *
This was the plan. Most fortunately hss Queens-
land spoiled it for the present, but it is to be
deplored that the men who crushed this black-
guard attempt to boLter up the most corrupt
department in the corrupt British service with Aus»
tralian money, are now going about among ttreir
frisnds and declaring that they opposed the
Naval Forces Bill to “ spite Griffith,” and not
because they objected to its principle.
Sea what it is to be governed by snob states-
men ! The bliss of it! What a keen bargain
they are wont to drive with the manufacturer
who stocks their warehouses, but to apply the
same principles of business to public affairs and
save Australian coin from the Admiralty cess-
pool-spirit of loyal y forbid it! No, no. They
may be forced to do their duty to their country to
“spite Griffith,” but they are too true to the
lofty and enduring principles of snobbery even to
dream of such a thing for the mere sake of vulgar
Democratic Australia,
• * #
Things have come to this pass in * 1 Democratic "
Australia that it is a surprise and relief to find
one man of courage and integrity in all the broad
land. After the hogwash we have been deluged
with lately, Chief Justice Higinbotham’b plain
speaking to Lord Carnarvon comes like a bracing
tea breeze on a muggy day in summer. If we
had a few more such men as the ah e and truly
Aust'alian “ Chief ” we would not hear again of the
Naval Forces Bill, or of British efforts to milk
the country in order to nourish official corruption.
“Fifty-Thousand Pounds.”
Going up the Parramatta River, just past Cocka-
too Island, on the left shore, you may see a beauti-
ful piece of land about thirty or forty acres in
extent, well-grassed, bub wholly unimproved. Ask
one of the steamer-hands and he will tell you
that that is the bio of land over whiohthere was a
lawsuit recently; that the owner took it years
ago for a bad debt of £BOO, and that lb is now
worth £50,000 ; that a lawsuit was brought to get
possession of it, but that the claimants were de-
feated. That is the history of it; now think over
what you have been told. Many years ago the
owner took it for a bad debt of £BOO, and it is now
worth £50,000. There are no improvements on it,
therefore the owner did not give it the added
value, which comes simply from the rise in land-
values everywhere. Alongside is a favourite
suburb where land is eagerly bought at
five and six pounds per frontage foot.
The owner, therefore, can sell out and get fifty
thousand of the little gold counters which we call
sovereigns, but which really represent men's
labour and ingenuity. He can henceforward live
at ease ; he can command the services of a retinue
of servants; he can eat up the produce of the
labour of scores of men, all by reason of
his £50,000 : that £50,000 is a tax l*id
on the community at large and paid more
or less by every member of it. You, O reider,
whatever you are—clerk, shopkeeper, lawyer,
'bus-driver, stockman, squatter, school-teacher—
you and we and all of us are paying this tax: our
labour goes in part to support ourselves, in part
to the general estate, and in part to make
up this £50,000, and similar sums, to land
owners, and what right has the owner of that
land to receive that money? None whatever 1
He chose, long ago, to invest £BOO ir a property
returniug no interest ; if ho hid used tte


land ha could have had his interest at 1(
—aye, or 20 or porhaps 50 par cant., but he h
left tha land Idle, and so cannot grumble a
get log no annual return for his money. i
course, he is entitled to get his £BOO back ; but
he entitled to any more ? No, a thousand tim
no 1 Why should you and I give our labour anc
our children’s labour, and live in poor houses, anc
work early and lata, and toil and pinoh and co
trive, to make up this £50,000, or that of any oth
landowner? Why should we harg this millston
round our necks ? Why should we pay this colo
sal tax ?
* * *
To the untutored in such matters, the injustl
is not at first apparent. They don’t see how th
fifty thousand is paid by the general public. The
say : “ The man who gives him the money is th
only one to look out. The servants whom
afterwards employs, and the tradespeople fro
whom he buys with the £so,ooo—they all get th
worth of their work and their goods, and they ar
not hurt.” Wait a moment, and we will show yc
as clear as the sun at noonday how this mone
falls on the general public.
♦ * *
The laud at first belonged to the State, and wa
sold for a mere trifle. Passing through variou
owners it got at last to our friend, who gave £BO
for it. There it stopped. The State progressed
the land, which, like tha air, is needed by, anc
should therefore be the properly of all, was re
quired for all purposes. It was wanted for dwel
lings for the population, it was wanted to
wharves, it was wanted for gardens. Stroll dow
the poorer parts of Pyrmonb and the Gleb 3, anc
see the filthy, dir by dwellings of the poorer classes
see the little children playing in the yards, a
called, 10 feet by 20. These people wanted tha
land, and all around it land was used and occupied
and prices wont on and rose. This bio o’ land ad
vauced from £BOO to £50,000, and where did th
increase come from ? Did the owner add it to th
land ? No ! If there had been no more progres
in N.S. Wales, no more work, no more demand fo
land than when £BOO was the price of It, would i
have advanced in value? Of course not. To what
then, is the increase due ? To the labou
of the whole population which has trans
formed what was once howling bush into
a populous suburb. If the people of New South
Wales had not built Sydney, had not worked anc
worked, building the suburbs, extending com
munlcation, improving natural opportunities, tha
bit of land would never have risen in value.
Therefore, we, the people, added the value, and ye
we pay i n , to the landowner. Do you see It now'
Let us make it even clearer. This land is very
suitable for a park, and is the only available land
in the vicinity. It is proposed that the Govern
ment resume the land for that purpose. Should
this be done the country will pay to the owner
£50,000 to buy back a piece of land for which the
country only received originally a few pence. It
is evident that in this event the £50,000 will be
paid by the community at large; ths debt-
burdened citizens of New South Wales will add to
their load of debt, and will hand over to one ol
their number (who, for all that we know, may
never have lived one day in the colony since he
took that land for the bad debt of £8001) the result
in money of the work of hundreds of them,
simply to get back a right to use a piece of land
which belonged to them originally, and which has
not been in the slightest degree improved—a
sensible proceeding surely.
* • *
What is true of this piece of land, ia true of all
freehold land. We should never have parted
with it, but, having done so, our next course is to
consider how to correct the error. In a former
article, on resumption without compensation, it
was pointed out by The Bulletin that a land-tax
would cure this evil; but, to do so, a land-tax
must be so severe as to amount to a resumption.
A small tax would only intensify the evil. There
Is no middle ccurse between absolute lesumption
and absolute dominion by the landlord, and this
we promise hereafter to demonstrate. We have
dealt here solely with the question of the justice
of private property in land, and have shown it to
be unjust. The same thing has been urged in our
columns so often as to be almost a truism to those
who have accepted the doctrine, but there are
many people who think that any questioning of
vested interests is a sacrilege To such we would
say: Do you consider you are fairly treated in
having to give up a share of your earnings to buy
this park and make up this £50,000?
A Matter for Regret?
At the recent banquet to that travelling bagma
of Imperial Federation, Lord Carnarvon, it wa
emphatically asserted that it is a matter of grea
regret that the United States separated from
Great Britain. As this is a statement which
becoming rather common, it would be well if
were carefully considered by the people of Aua
tralia, to whom it is a matter of special interest
If an event is to be regretted some misfortune o
loss must be connected with it. Hence, if the in
dependence of the United States is regretable, i
has occasioned some loss or misfortune. If it has
who has suffered the loss ? Let us see,
* * *
Had those who are now the sixty millions o
American citizens remained fellow-subjects with
the forty miilions of Europeans under the Crown
of England, there would now be a power under the
sceptre of Victoria such as has not been seen
ince the world began. One hundred millions o:
Anglo-Saxons subject to monarchical and aristo
cratic institutions would form an Empire that
would dominate and terrify the rest of the world.
Yet what would the mighty race of American
freemen gain by forming the central pedestal of
such an institution ? It is their great fortune to
be able to wrap their souls entirely in the solution
of the grand problem of how best to ensure for them-
selves perfectpeace, happiness, and prosperity. Sup-
posing that, instead of exclusive devotion to ques-
tions of this kind, they were compelled to devote
their thoughts and resources to the destruction of
the South American Republics, and so make their
Imperial wire-pullers masters of the whole Ameri-
can Continent; suppose they were engaged in
planting the flag of Britain from the Persian Gulf
to the Chinese Sea; were busied in driving the
Dutch out of the Indian Ocean ; were pushing the
Russians back into Siberia; were expelling the
French from Africa; or were generally snubbing
or hectoring the foreign world : What would they
gain? They would gain what the Roman people
did when they had subdued the world, and that
was vice and corruption, loss of the very idea of
human liberty, beggary and starvation for the
masses, and fabulous wealth for the satrap classes.
Results such as these would be a sorry exchange
for that perfect peace, the world’s respect, the
rights of man, aid th se cmdit’o s of life which
ensure aa equal chance of cjmf Jr: and happiness
to the vast bulk of the citizens of the Republic
Now, theirs is the lob where—
“ One moves in silence by the stream,
With sad, yet watchful eyes.
Calm as the patient planet’s gleam
That walks the clouded skies.
“ Along its front no sabres shine,
No blood-red pennons wave ;
It's banner bears the single line—
‘ Oar duty is to save.’ ”
And should they change this for a fate where—
“ One marches to the drum-beat's roll,
The wide-mouthed clarion’s bray,
And bears upon a crimson ccroll,
‘ Oar duty is to slay.’ ”
But, perchance, it may be said that a hundred
millions of Anglo Saxons under a monarchy would
not necessarily spend their time in bullying and
crushing other peoples. To this the reply is that
the foreign career of Britain, under royal and
aristocratic guidance, has been one long scene of
aggression ; so much so that she has always been
either hated, feared, or despised, and has never
yet gained the esteem of a single power, either
weak or strong. Her pathway round the world
ha» bean a track of blood, and to main-
tain it she has pauperlsad Ihe massrs of her
people, and has benefl ed none save her merchant
princes and her hereditary idols To these, it is
most true, it would be an immense advantage
had they American swords to increase their prey ;
and, batter still, it there were no splendid example
to the subjects of Victoria of how well mankind
can do without hereditary monarchs, lords, and
privileges, Looking at the matter in this light,
one can well admit .that the separation of the
United States has been a great misfortune. It
will be another such mi,fortune when the Austra-
lian States shall learn to despise a position of sub-
jection, and shall follow in the lines of the great
Republic. Especially may we say so now, when in
addiiioa to providing fat billets for a contingent
of the Insolvent and pariah section of the British
aristocracy, she is furnishing a subsidy of £120,000
per annum to maintain a much greater number cf
them or their offspring. God speed the day when
this new misfortune shall come : for then, and not
till then, will the light of Australia arise and
shine.

Bishop Barry and “Intolerant
Sectarianism”
1 would rather have the narrowest and most intolerant
sectarianism than the easy toleration of a supercilious or
sceptical indifference."-Bishop Bariiy, as reported by Daily
Christi anit y in’Australia, and particularly Chr
tianity In N.S.W., is fortunate in having, as
exponent of the latter-day phase of its aims anc
aspirations, and the guardian of the temporal anc

“Feed my sheep.’ 1 Bishop Barry says:

is not so ambitious. He is perfectly willing
take his place with Alva and Philip of Spain
with Bloody Mary and Bishop Bonnor, with Ner
and Caligula and Domitian, with Catherine d
Medicis and Charles IX. and Louis XIV
of Franca, with the persecutors of the Waldens. 3

m»y or miy not be “judiciously” iatoleranl
Indeed, Bishop Barry is now doiog what th
Church has in effect done long ago, although i
does not make audible admission. Bishop Barry
has renounced Christianity. He has entirel;
shown Organised Churchlsm to be what it is—at
engine for spoliation. He has cleared it by hi
recant utterances of that spirit of charity which
has alone hitherto recommended it to men. H

says : “ Hate your enemies.” He has shown the

Spirit of love! No fear I “I never give
money in the street,” and “ I would rather
have the narrowest and most intolerant sectarian
ism than the easy toleration of a supercilious or
sceptical indifference.” Of course you would,
Bishop Barry. You live on that sort of thing.
“ Intolerant sectarianism ” enables you to dwel
in a princely suburban mansion, to daffy feed on
sumptuous dishes your alleged Master never tasted
or even sniffed the savour of. “Intolerant sec-
tarianism ” enables you to appear in a splendidly
appointed cathedral, in imposing state, clad in
embroidered canonicals, and the same spirit of
bigotry you affect so much to admire accepts your
lightest utterance as a Goo-dellvered revelation
from the Infinite. But still, Bishop Barry, you
are foolish to make such admissions, for the faith
still lives in some whom it is not wise to unde-
ceive. To such you have proclaimed: “I never
give money in the street,” and, “ I refuse to exer-
cise toleration to an adversary.” In other words,
you have no charity—neither charity for the mind,
nor charity for the body. You are selfish and
caffous, and stupidly honest enough to admit it.
Christ said: “Feed my sheep,” and Bishop
Barry adds—“on brickbats.” Christ said:
“ Love one another.” B shop Barry says : “ Hate
one another, but especially hate the fellow who is
bo sceptically indifferent about his soul that he
will not pay me for looking after it.’ Yet this is
the spirit of Christianity at the present day. If
you would know how far it has sunk, behold
what Christians will tolerate from their professed
leaders without rebuking them !
Cremation, or Quicklime?
Now that the world is getting crowded up by live
men, it might be advantageous if the dead could
be induced to sit a little closer, and take up less
room than heretofore. Modern cemeteries appear
to be arranged for the express purpose of spread-
ing out the deceased and filling the largest pos-
sible area with useless bones, and coliios are made
durable and strong in order to pressrve the en>
closed remains to pollute the earth and air as long
as possible, while the ground which they occupy
is badly wanted for growing cabbagee. The
marble monuments of the white man’s graveyard
hold down not the silent loveliness of death re-
garding which poets have raved and painters
have spilt gay colours for so many years-but
masses of semi-fluid putrefaction, and the busts
and inscriptions, the broken columns and stony
vases and other adornments, are canted to one
side by the expansive force of the malarious gases
arising from below. The remains of youth and
beauty are planted beneath the soil in the name
of Christianity and decency, to be slowly eaten
away by the crawling things of the earth in the
slow course of years of decay, horror, and loathe-
someness, and yet public sentiment persistently
regards any process by which the accumulated
ugliness of the tomb may be abolished as something
unnatural and disgusting as well as un-Christian.
Under the present system, the man who dies on the
gallows gets ahead of the gilded monarch who
passes away in his bed of state. The one is en-
cased in quicklime, and in a few weeks his bcdy
is resolved in'o odourless earth as sweet and pure
as the grassy, daisy-strewn surface of the moun
tain side ; the other is shrouded in a triple coffin
and left to degenerate into a thing of unspeakable
uncleanness—a parody ot a human being hidden
beneath a velvet pall. The present system of
burial is maintained chiefly as an adjunct to the
doctrine of a bodily resurrection, and the Christian
mode of preparing for that resurrection is to trans-
form the human frame into a bucketful of evil
slush - a strangely-ludicrously unacceptable offer-
ing at the gates of pearl. It is more than time
that the burial customs which the nineteenth
century has borrowed from the barbarism rf the
first should be abolished. Cremation, so far, has
made little progress, but quicklime is cheaper and
equally effective. A few weeks ago the grave of
Henry WAiNEWRiGirr-who was judicially mur-
dered for his brother’s crime—was opened, and of
the remains of that humble, unwept, unhonoured
martyr not a vestige remained, and Lipski, who
was Interred in the same grave—the ruffianly
murderer sharing the tomb of the innocent victim
—has probably by this time also turned into earth.
The devouring force of quicklime destroys all the
horrors of the charnel-house, and when a
law is passed requiring the coffins of the
dead to be packed with this substance
the dead will leave more room for the living, and
the surface of the cemeteries will no longer yawn
in huge cracks through which belch forth the
vapours of disease bred by the second death be-
neath. The old, pathetic gag of dnst returning
unto dust is a delusion and a sham ; it is not dust,
but a mass of poison—one part human being,
three pirts festering corruption - which returns
to mother earth, and it is on behalf of this appal-
ling compound that the opponents of burial-re-
form lift their voices on high. The old Conser-
vative always gives his vote on behalf of the
hoary unolaanness of the past merely because
it is an old and well-established stench from the
charnel-house of antiquity, and meanwhile this
particular tradition is fouling the earth, and fliiicg
the air with malaria Cremation or quicklime
the choice at present lies between the two, and
the latter, as the simplest, cheapest, and most ra-
tional remedy for the present evil, ought to win.
Government by Goths and Vandals.
Thk proposal to cut up and sell to private
speculators a considerable portion of the
lovely see eery of the Fitzroy Falls (N.S.W.)
is the last hideous blunder of a Govern-
ment which is headed by an insolvent poet and
tails off in a gilded whisky-seller. The ostensible
author of this act of sordid Vandalism is, of
course, Mr. Thomas Garrett, ex-printer’s devil,
ex-compositor, ex-land agent, and now Minister
of Lands in New South Wales, but the act is
merely a part of the policy of every Government
of which Henry Parkbs has been the he id.
Whatever God has made and Parkes has had a
chance to sell, has been sold ; the sordid bard of
Brummagem has spared nothing that has come in
his way, and while he, the hollow-hearted importer
ot nigger-labour, was compounding shoddy verses
about the beauties of Nature, he has turned the
lovely shores of Sydney’s land-locked harbour
into cash, and cut up the mountains and the
borders of the lakes into three-cornered allot-
ments. He would have sold the Isles of Greece if
he had had the chance, and made dog-eared poetry
about their ancientlegends and their weird loveliness
while they were under the hammer, and if Niagara
had come within the reach of his Gothic intellect,
he or his friends in the land-auction business
would probably have advertised it as a convenient
village site with a water frontage. In the
present case, however, the Parkes Government
shows not only its wonted hog-like insensibility to
everything except ready-money to pay for Dead
Houses, Queen’s statues, Wardour-street brick-
a brack and other expensive follies, but
it has been guilty of a brutal and high-
handed outrage upon the vested rights of a free
nation. Some tan or eleven years ago the land
surrounding the Fitzcoy Falls was set aside as a
National be enjoyed by the people for
ever, and this right, supposed to be sacred and
Inalienable, has bean secretly cancelled by one
stroke of the pen. The property ot the nation is
enjoyed by the nation only so long as tha Parkes
Administration does not choose to lay violent
hands on it, but when it suits that body ot gin-
sellers, poets, pawnshop-directors, and ‘‘red-hot
brands of shame” to annex the public parks, with-
out even going through the empty form of asking
for Parliamentary sanction, the aged Hemperor
and his satellites are in their glory. A few months
ago they tried the public sent ment by temporarily
closing Sydney Domain (to pleasa Carington and
Co.) for the benefit of an itinerant showman who,
to make money, was ready to allow the crumbs to
fall from his table into the gaping mouth of the
“ Queen’s Fund,” aid, as this outrage (which in-
volved scores of suffering hospital patients being
aroused from their morphia laden slumbers by the
bursting of bombs and the rushing of rockets) was
endured in comparative iilence, they naturally con-
cluded that the way was open for their favourite
policy of sp illation. The encroach® entupon the Fitz-
roy Falls to-day eatabliahesapieotdenjwnich may
be followed up to morrow by the sale of tbe
Sydney Domain itself, and the conversion of that
splendid park into a wilderness of bricks and
mortar, in order to fill a tre tsury wnich has been
emptied by pandering to Imperial fada and by
caatly dnvel in the canae of Federation with the
groeiy, debased awaahbucklera of a foreign people
across the sea. The nation which endures in
silence the plundering of the Eitzroy Falla reserv
with its surrounding beauties of cliffs and gorge?
and allows the grandest scenery in New South Wales
to be cut up to form a fifth rate village, with a
gm-shop at each corner, and a scattered array of
weatherboard cottages, ditty back-yards, unkempt
hens, goats, pigs, muck-heaps, and the other
dingy surroundings of a petty up-country town-
ship, has forfeited all right to protest against the
seizure of the Sydney parks and their conversion
into dreary streets and festering lanes. The
antiquated Vandals who are responsible for the
iniquity now being perpetrated will lay their un-
clean hands on the Sydney Domain when the oc-
casion comes, and with their new-made precedent
to support them there is no visible reason why a
second act of political thieving should not be as
successful as the first.
diiK Argus declares that the number of super-
numeraries employed in the public ser-
vice of Victoria shows a falling, off when
compared with the number of appoint-
ments really made, because these men are only
engaged for three months, whilst, formerly, they
were employed permanently. In its anxiety to
bolster up Its pet system, it overlooks the fact
that the ‘ supernumeraries” of old days were
real!/ permanent hands who could not obtain
their classification owing to the tradition limiting
the stall to the size it had at the commencement
of responsible Government. The number of per-
manent appointments made to the Service is as
great as, or greater than, that of all appointments
under the old regime, and the temporary assistants
a-e additional—to say nothing of the fact that all
the old political and other supernumeraries are
now cn the permanent staff. We are no
advocates of any form of patronage, but
the present Victorian system is Star Cham-
her patronage, which is worse than the
old political, for that wa3 known and open, and in
some degree neutralised itself. The fact Is that,
under the sway of a secret, arbitrary, irrespon-
sible, and too often lawless despotism, not amen-
able to the corrective influences of public opinion
and free discussion, the public servants have
become disheartened, and cannot perform so
much work as they did formerly. In the old days
they braced themselves and got over an emer-
gency by their own exertions ; now they are too
much disgusted with the state of affairs to do
anything of the sort, and call for the “three-
monthers” to pull up arrears,

St. James Gazette is a spiteful and impotent
organ of disappointed Toryism, which nobody ever
sees outside high-toned Conservative circles. It
has a circulation of more than 17 copies a night,
and its pronouncements, which in London reach
few people but the old bald-headed glutton who
ultimately dies of apoplexy in his cliair at the
Carlton Club, are regularly cabled to Australia
and accepted by the stipendiary liars of the daily
papers as English “ public opinion.” Well, the
Gazette aforesaid has just discovered
that English women are dissatisfied because
English men now-a days are such poor fellows as
actually to be ‘ thrilled with effeminate pain if an
injury is dene to the skin of a cat or of an Irish

English women must bo, then ! We quite long

would not be the fellow with the check clothes

he ordered a hen-roost thief up to the triangles.
From a London Conservative paper Life—
which says what the more adroit dailies only dara
to think :
Perhaps the English, and above all the London, backers
of sedition-mongers in Ireland are not aware of the fact,
quoted by Lord Hunky Bruce the other dav at Beckham
that there are 150,000 families in the motmpelL who have
only one room to live in. Eor that single room, in a grimy
back-street, and generally m a wretched state of disrepair, a
rent is paid of from half-a-crown to four shillings a week,
and no deductions are to be got from Land Commisdoners.
There is far more wretchedness and destitution in East
London alone than there is in the whole of Ireland • but
then the sufferers are unromantically law-abiding English-
men, whose misery cannot be used as a political weapon.
Is the patience of the Englishman who lives in
one room with his wife and children, while Lady
Brown and the Marchioness of Potts-Point are
stripping themselves to the waist and having
diamonds sewn on to their shoulder-straps-is the
patience of that Englishman a virtue or a vice 1
Which would be the nobler Englishman—he who
fought at the barricades for his wife, or he who
tolled to find for his landlord rent-money to be
spent in debauching the daughters of the work-
man ? Is not this blue blooded writer merely
pointing out to the London starveling what a dull
stupid, driven bullock the Englishman is I '

HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
There ia a strikingly dramatic picture given
by Dickens in “ Great Expectations.” You re-
member how he describes the capture of Mag witch
and Compeyson on the marshes ; and then how
Pip from the shore watches the marines rowing
through the fog to the icavicb hulk lying out
upon the gloomy water. One of the soldiers
carries a torch, which gets dimmer and redder
through the mist as they go. How the boat
reaches the ship. The re-captured convicts
are helpsd on board. The marine throws the
torch hissing and spluttering into the sea. There
is a quick flash—and all is dark again. It seems
to the boy that the lives of those convicts have
gone out with ic. Bub both Dickens and Pip
were wrong. The unhappy conviocs’ miserable
lives were recommencing. They held wonderful
unexhausted capacities lor the endurance of hellish
torture yet.
* • *
The system under which transportation
was flrst carried on was a disgrace to tae British
name, and, go far, it was consistent with the rest
of this griffy story. The work o? carrying con-
victs was entrusted to contracr.rs, who received
sixpence per day fo each convicts fcoi-Allowf.nce,
beside a tonnage rate. It would be impossible to
believe the stones told ot ti e wolfish greed of
these contractors, if they were not borne cut by
State papers and recorded facts. The longer lha
voyage lasted, the longer the contractors drew
their miserable allowance, and these sixpences
were, of course, saved in cases where the convict
died. Tima a businesslike understanding was
established, under which the human cargoes died,
off like rotten sheep, The figures tell the story.
Dr. White, the colonial surgeon who came out
with Phillip, wrote some reporls on this subject.
“ Of the 939 males,” he says, in 1790, “sent out
by the last ships—the Surprise, Scarborough, and
Neptune—26l died on board, and 50 have died
since landing ; the number of sick this day is 450,
and many who are reckoned as not sick have
barely strength to attend to themselves ; when
the last ships arrived we had not 60 people sick in
the colony.” One hundred and sixty-four
convicts died on the Neptune alone. In 1802,
66 convicts succumbed on one voyage between
Cape Town and Sydney. During the first eight
years of settlement upwards of one-tenth of the
convicts died on the voyage. The caravan-tracks
across the desert are marked by the bleaching
bones of beasts and men, but the track of these
convict ships across the ocean might have been as
easily distinguishable by its line of floating
corpses.
» * *
This was not all. “ Floating hells ” was
the name the convict-ships soon earned. Crowds
of convicts were thrown into the holds, with little
ventilation and without superv sion, Brutality
and irons were the only means used to enforce
order. The wretched vessels employed were not
large enough to accommodate the number of con-
victs whom the greed of the contractors and the care-
lessness of the Government forced on board. They
might well have felt themselves handed over to
the irresponsible tortures of fiends. If any were
over tortured and died in consequence, they were
easily thrown overboard. There was no difficulty
about that. Herded like pigs, but not half so
well fed; half-clothed, snd robbed on board of
any comforts a kind hand might have provided
for the voyage ; chained to a dead body, some-
times, or to a dying man. and flogged into mutiny
and out of it at the crprlca of a drunken skipper,
these unhappy convicts, in their despair, often
preferred the gaping maw of a hungry shark to
the horrors of the prison-ship. The shark, at
least, would use no more violence than was neces-
sary.' But the records show that these drunken
skippers tortured their victims because they
liked it.
* * *
If the condition of the men was bad, that
of the females and children was worse. Under
the savage laws of the time women and g rls,
often of gentle lives and honest parentage, were
found on board the women’s ships. “ Not a few
of tho convicts,” says Banwick, “ were mere boys
and girls of from 13 to 15 years of age.” This is
the one touch of horror wanted to complete the
revolting picture. The rest ot the shameless
story is best indicated by another quotation. Iu
1806 Captain Bertram, writing about these floating
Gomorrahs, has this : “ The captain and each
officer enjoy the right of seleotion Thus they
continue the habit of concubinage until the convicts
arrive at Sydney town. Each sailor or soldier
is permitted to attach himself to one of the
females.” The reader can fill out the picture for
himself.
# * •
Surely no den of infamy or lair of vice
and crime ever equalled the scene presented by
the hold of one cf these prison-ships I The hor-
rors of the slave-trade have made men’s blood
boil with indignation, and the smug virtue of the
bourgeois Briton even induced John Bull to relax
his purse-strings—an exaggerated excess of emo-
tion !—to put down the foreign iniquity. But
what story of the slave-trade ever equalled in the
graphic intensity of its horrors the unholy abomi-
nations carried on wich white men and white
women andgirß as the helpless victims for nearly 50
years under Eogland's own flag ? These wretches
were criminals it is true ; but they were men,
women, and children stil'. Their crimes were often
petty offences by contrast with the outrages ot their
gaolers, or in the light of the British criminal code
of to-day. But the smug hypocrisy which would
have freed and Chrlstianissd the black man had no
merciful thought for them. What Mumbo-
Jumbo fetich or Oriental fanaticism has ever
evoked greater horrors than these re gulls of the
boasted British civilisation under a Christian Par-
liament and king? Surely none. By its
fruits you may know it.
* * *
We read sometimes in the stories of the
slave-trade how the negroes were forced on deck
to dance to the music of a pipe. This was for
exercise. It was thought wrong to depreciate
the market-value of the labour on board by sap-
ping its strength in idle confl cement. The con-
vict men and women also danced on board some-
times. But it was to the music of the boatswain’s
“cat.” It was considered a treat for the sailors
to be allowed to flog the convic s But It was a
refinement of luxury to flog women. The noble
creatures pleasantly contended for this graceful
privilege. It any woman-convict objected to the
arrangement described by Captain Bertram as
some rustic Devonshire girl convicted of stealing
apples and transported by some booby squire
might have done—she was at once flogged into
submission. If this was not done on the direct
charge, another was easily invented. But, as a
rule no misunderstandings arose from idle
scruples in this matter. If a drunken officer
wanted a man or woman, girl or boy, flogged at
thfi vangwav for his amusement there was to
trouble about a trifle like that. But the b-nt
results in this direction wore obtained when the
ships carried a guard of recruits for the New
South Wales Corps on board. These were artists
in vice, in their own squalid way. Often they
were placed In charge of a womon’s-ship. The
Juliana, for instance, carried 226 women. One is
not surprised to find that the voyage lasted 15
months. The wonder is that it ever finished in
the usual way at all.
« * ®
One ship carried 36 pairs of handcuffs and
200 basils with chains for use on the voyage
Many convicts made the voyage in irons all the
way. It saved trouble. Charges of attempted or
intended mutiny were trumped up. Governor
Hunter mentions a case where, “ in consequence
of some conjecture that they meant to seize the
ship and murder the officers,” the whole cargo was
ironed for the whole voyage. “They fluk most
wretched from their long cenflremeat," he adds,
with simple nearness*. On the Marquis of Corn-
wallis, in 1796, an intended mu iay was disclo.-ed
to the oaptai aby a convict. The captain could
only induce the soldiers and sailors to spare lives
by tempting them with the offer of a wholesale
flogging, in which each should take his par . “At
11 o'c’ock we commenced flogging thesa vi Lins
at the gangway, and continu d engaged on that
service till 42 men and 8 women received tfieir
punishment.” Tae Lady Shore left E iglacd for
Sydney in 1798, with a reinforcement far ilia New
South Wales corps, and 60 female prisoners, The
voyage was an orgie from the stara. at length
the so diers mutinied, seized the ship, which was
carrying provisions for the colony, and murdered
the master and flrst mate. They carried on a
wild career of license and debauchery on the high
seas wi h their floating bagnio of convict-women
fra time, and then sailed to Rio Ja eiro, and
handed the ship over to the Portuguese Governor
there. The captain of the Hercu es fired volleys
into the hold of his ship in expostulation with tae
convicts there confined. He was tried for murder,
convicted, and —fined. A revolt of convicts in
Sydney Harbour was once quelled in this way.
Shotted blunderbusses were often fired in’o the
holds of vessels. Naked women fought there like
fiends, and men festered in their filth like worms.
But, in the end, a fair proper ion of this hazar-
dous colonising material reached Australia.
* * •
It is calculated that fifty thousand convicts
left British ports for Botany Bay during the fifty
years that transportation lasted. Ttey did not
all reach their destination. The horrors of the
voyage for some years decimated the deportes,
Tho Black Hole of Calcutta was only a trifling in-
cident iu comparison with this tale of torture long
drawn out From the reports of Dr, White we g ither
something of the horrors these “ floating hells ’’
carried into harbour. When he went on board,
as it was his duty to do, he found dead bodies
still in irons below, amongst the crowds of tho
living. Herrs is what he found in another place :
“ A great number of them were lying, some half
and others nearly quite naked, without either bed
or bedding, unable to turn or help themselves. The
smell was so offensive that I could hardly bear it
Some of these unhappy people died after the ship
came into the harbour, before they could be taken
on shore. Part of these had been thrown into the j
harbour, anl their dead bodies cast upon the J

grave,” “ I shall never recover my acc istomed
vivacity and spirits,” said Captain Hill, after a

long voyage was reached at last, and the survi-
vors were abouo' to enter into the inheritance Pro-

they got on there.
This is what G. R Sims has to say in the Referee
about the new police persecution of the London
unemployed “ Thera are a few people generous
enough to admit that it would be batter to sup-
press the starvation than the starvers, and that
the beat way to limit this constantly-recurring
danger (Trafalgar-square gatherings) is to treat
the disease in its first development instead of
poleaxing the patient in its final stage.” Coming
from a man who has studied the poor and their
poverty, these wards are significant. Land-
owners, capitalists, and Tory parsons who choose
to regard destitution as a dispensation of Provi-
dence and a means for keeping down the rate of
wages, who smile at the notion of making laws
for others than the influential class-cm further
read what Sims has to say about the flrst develop-
ment of the gnat social sbra —“ The pocr of Eng-
land are preyed open by their landlords, by their
tradesmen, their pawnbrokers, their puoilcans,
and their bankers. The y are exploited and cheated
in a hundred ways ; in earning their money, in
spending it, and in trying to save it. Half the
earnings of the poor are lost to them for la-k of
that legislative projection which they have a
right as citizens to receive. The reason of this
neglect is that until lately they haven’t made
themselves objectionable.” Here is an answer to
the highly respectable people who protest that
the unemployed are only damaging their
cause by “disloyal” demonstration, as though
my lords and gentlemen ware panting to “do
something,” provided only that the hungry ones
do nothing. But while the masses were content
to groan beneath their breath, priests, peers, and
politicians made this patient silence an excuse for
babbling about national prosperity under tte
glorious British Constitution. How can the un-
employed damage their cause with the wealthier
classes, who never advanced or supported it by
word or deed? What beneficent laws can be re
pealed on acoount of thesa demonstrations, when
(as Sims puts it) the poor are suffering fOr lack of
legislative protection, simply because they haven't
hitherto created disturbances? And now they are
making themselves nasty it will be well for the
born Tories, and the “loyal, law-abiding citizens,”
who have become Tories as they accumulated
wealth, to meet the situation with wise legislation
Duatging their cause, forsooth ! No liberal poli-
tical measures —Reform Bills, Irish Church Bill,
Abolition of Purchase in the Army Bill—have
ever been passed in England until the
masses began to pull up park palings and
make themselves exceedingly “ objectionable ”
At the late Carnarvon banquet, in Sydney, the
“noble lord” from England poured out his soul in
admiration of the Soudan piracy, and nearly broke
his neck in bowing to Parkks —who sat next him
—as one of the distinguished apprentice brigands
who got up that much-bung ; od piece of gratuitous
bushranging, and Parkks reclined in his chair,
with a simple smile on the dreary waste of his
countenance, and accepted all the gush in agree-
able silence. When a lord was bowing to him
and scraping up the dust with his hind leg in
honour of an undertaking which he (Parkes) had
cursed, and kicked, and thrown mud at from start
to flnl h, ’Enery Parkes was not the man to
rise and stale that he wasn’t the butcher to whom

Billism as pleasantly as if he had been a scalp-
hunting Buffalo Bill from his youth upwards.
He even went out of his way to allude to Car-
narvon. as a “ Liberal,” and he didn’t look as if
he meant it for a joke either. And yet Carnar-

At this sacred season of goodwill and charity the
truly pious alms giver delights to see his nama in
print. The Aim us is a favourite advertising
medium for high-class benevo’ence, and the editor

think that it makes no difference who sends a
cheque of that sort, so long as the poor and needy
put it finally away in the form of plum-pudding,
but Popping, with his eye fixed on the Great
Hereafter, knew better. So he wrote to the editor,

Editor Bulletin,— Sir,—-With youreelf, I do not
believe in the disgusting and brutal punishment
of flogging, and on Xmas Day my mind was much
occupied (while listening to a sermon on the
theme of ‘God’s Love”) with the case
of the miserable, soft brained wretch, August
Gabriel, lying under sentence of punish-
ment by flogging. I thought that the preach-
ing of peace on earth and goodwill to nun
was somewhat out of hjrmony with the irra-
tional almlnistration of the lash to the back
of a poor unfortunate crank of a foreigner,
however degrading and vl'e his offence.
On Sunday afternoon I set myself to the task of
deprivlrg ihe flogger of his victim. I prepared
notices of appeal, and on Monday morning served
the clerk to the convicting justices and the officer
of polios prosecuting in the case with the notic s,
and at 11 15 a.m. had the pleasure of handing to
the lockup-keeper at Wodloomcoloo a warrant
under the hand of one of the convicting justices
directing the respile of the sentence until the de-
termination of the appeal. In my opinion, the
means taken in this case to stay the administra-
tion of the lash will virtually make the law obso-
lete, as under the New South Wales Criminal La w
Amendment Act, sect’on 117, it is provided that
floggings shall be inflicted during the term of
imprisonment awarded, which Is to be not less
than six, nor more than ninety-six hours. Should
the Judge at Quarter Sessions uphold the con-
viction, how can the flogging be carried out, as
the law requires it to be administered within the
space of 96 hours after conviction? Yours truly,
Lex.
An early N.Z. Missionary used to tell the
following story of his soul-saving experience
among the MTories :—“There was a baptism of
converts one moning, and amorg tha candidates
w<fis a young man of the Ngapuhi tribe, who was
knqwn as a ‘ pourangi ’ (which is equivalent to
being ‘ off his Kadoova ’). Well, it happened
that a young wag of his acquaintance, by name
Torenoa, persuaded the candidate for baptism
that as he had tested human flesh as a child, and
was therefore guilty of the heinous crime of can-
nibalism, the ordinary application of baptismal
water was hardly sufficient, and that he should
have soap rubbed into his cranium. The neophj te
agreed that the suggestion was Kapai, but when
he submitted himself to the manipulation of
Toreaoa, that humorist, being tempted of the
devil and of malice aforethought, deliberately
rubbed into his hair the contents of about half-a-
box of seidtitz powders. The consequence was
that when the baptismal water reached the
disciple's hair it produced a miniature geyser, and
he, almost maddened with fear, rushed out of the
sacred edifice of raupo, followed by his fellow-
tribesmen. It was a long time before I could get
any more candida'es for baptism.”
We deeply sympathise with Rev. John
Jones, who Was recently ejected by a draggled
child of sin from his pastorate among the niggers
of the Loyalty Islands. He was peacefully revising
the Scriptures one bright summer morning when
a soulless Frenchman came in and ordered him to
shunt. “ Wot ? ” said the staggered Apostle.
“Git!” said the Frenchman ; “Marchez! Saore !
Goddam! Gerrout! Whiz!” There was nothing
else for it, and the saint whizzed. “As a Bri’ish
citizen,” he said faintly, “ I protests agin this
’ere dutrsge,” “Shoo !” retorted the Gaul, as it
the good man had been a hen in a yard, and the
Rev. John Jones solemnly nut on his hat and took
his umbrella, and went on' board the French war-
vessel in the harbour. The rest may be told in
his own pathetic words :
The first lieutenant took me into his cabin, gave me writ-
ing material, and asked me to write out a list of what more
I needed. I seat my servant to seek for some sermons and
other manuscripts and some shoes. The latter he found,
but failed to find the former.
That was ail he wanted —a few sermons and some
shoos. He didn’t even send back for a toothbrush,
or an extra clean shirt, or anything—he was ready
to face the world with his old discourse in one
hand and his boats in the other. And, as it hap-
pened, the imbecile nigger couldn’t find the old
discourse, and the belated apostle was shunted
with only the boots. If he had forgotten to put
the silver spoons In his tail-packet it naturally
follows that they were left behind. Perhaps he
hadn’t even a handkerchief —who knows ? These
things make us weep. We know how hard it is
to have to start life afresh with nothing but some
shoes, and when we cleared out under pressure of
circumstances we hadn’t even an aggravating
darkey to send back in search of our old sermons.
I And if we had he wouldn’t have found them. We
never bad any sermons.

In th ir seejni innings against Lily -

back for an aggregate score of six runs.
After a well-contested game N.S.W. won
the interooloaial cricket match by two wickets,
and one sun, the scores being : Victoria, Ist in-

When Slugger Sullivan reached London-
there was such a crowd at the railway terminus
that he endeavoured to escape in a funeral coach.

The fielding of the Victorians while
Shrewsbury and Co. were making 624, waj never'
really bad, generally very good, and occasionally
brilliant. In fact, up to the time when the score
stoed at 500 for four wickeds, there was not an
easy catch missed. The all-round quality of the
bowling can be imagined.

From a* financial point of view the Vie- -

refusing patronage to Lillywhite’s projected team..

stimulate interest In a game which now draws as,
many as 20,000 people when a big local match is
on hand. If the Victorians ran rings (as they-
probably would) round the. visitors there would
be no additional interest apd gate-money in club
contests And if, perchance, the Englishmen took,
the shine out of colpaial football, then the game
would droop apd wither as cricket has ever since
the fourth Austral an Eleven destroyed our*
prestige. No member of the Association had the
pluck to admit that the Victorians take no inter*

their legs under the table so that the toe of the-

We wobble aimlessly for words to express
our feeling* after witnessing the production of
“In the Ranks” at Her Majesty’s (Sydney).
Language, we understand, was given to enable
the enraged public to conceal its thoughts, but all
the language at our command cannot hide our
sentiments on the subject of this much-advertised
screed in five acts. Its claim to originality is
crushed at the very outsat by the arrival of the
rich and cantankerous uncle from abroad —the
same uncle who has bean arriving from abroad
ever since the days when the “School for
Scandal’’ was young, and the next time that
uncle arrives from abroad we mean to imbrue our
hands in his gore, and forward his ears to his
solicitor by book-post, and send him home in a
hand cart, carrying his head in a portmanteau
and his eye on a fork. Apart from the uncle, the
chief motive power of the play is a human being
caked with dirt—a compound of gin and slimy
ferocity attred in dish-rags, and possessed of a
voice like a young pig in its death agonies—who
also arrives from abroad, and blows the imida cut
of the uncle. The old man was fooling round in
the neighbourhood of a damp waterfall at mid-
night, so his fate is just what might have been
expected. A young man who has done little, so
far, except endeavour to suppress a tendency to
tears, goes a’-d enlists about this time, leaving his
wife to take in plain sewing, and be preyed upon
by the assassin dressed in dish-rags. He is the hero
of the piece, and is terribly gone on the legs of his
soul. Any man who wasn’t a hero would have
taken a billet as light porter, or turned pr acher,
or pirate, or dog-fancier, or something, and looked
afrer the poor lictle girl who had trusted her fate
to his hands, but he loafs about in a red uniform,
aud goes into convulsions which pay no dividend
in the barrack-sqnarelwhea ho learns that his wife
is dying by inches in a dingy back street with
hardly anything to eat and a hungry murdorer to
feed out of her earnings. Finally, of coarse, tho
uncle with the inside blown out of him comes to
the rescue, and lifts this haughty pauper out of
the gutter, the high toned imaje being too useless
to do anything for himself but strike fat attitudes
of grief at tuppence a day. There are 37 charac-
ters in the bill, and about 50 miscellaneous
stragglers, but the business of the whole crowd is
merely to show off the shining virtues of the high
polite village swell, who can’t even wheel a cats- !
meat barrow for a living.

that the characters bang
each other about the
head more recklessly
than they used to in tie

mist which rises from a
raving, heaving congre-

sin is at a discount whan “Jack Sheppard” is
about, and unless he puts his choir In tights he is
not likely to regain his lost ground, while the
charming Fanny Robina survives. Miss Florence
Harcourt is as pretty as ever in the part of
Thames Darrell, and Mr. Royco fills his old
character ot Bluaskln with a'l his old velocity,
till he resembles a whirling spider possessed by
seven devils of drink and insanity. Mr. Brough,
unluckily, is not present in his former rdle of

almost as frantic as he used to be, and
the other characters are loud and voluble
enough to satisfy any average audience.

The Christmas festival of 1887 has been
the dreariest and most mutton-headed shivoo
which Sydney has seen for many years. All the
world has been drying its pants by the fire ; the
city has bean a saddening vision of slops and um-
brellas, damp cats, damp kittens, and damp dogs,
soaked goats weeping under verandahs, sodden
horses being walloped through the streets, and
the escaped Christmas hen coughing in croupy
accents among the coals in the back-yard ; and,
on top of all this, we forgot to get in any bear on
Saturday n'ght, and had to celebrate on pump-
water. Mr. Dampier, however, seemed to bear
up pretty well amid this accumulation of aggra-
vating sorrows, and the five-act drama, “ The
World against Her," went smoothly at the
Gaiety. The man who wrote it was not abso-
lutely maddened by genius or crushed to earth by
the weight of his own head, but still he has pro-
duced an average melodrama, which might have
been a lot worse if it had wanted to very badly.
An injured wife, who is wrecked and divorced
through the machination s of Mr. Baker, has the
dark shadows of her life lightened a little by a
moral Punch-and- Judy man whom she meets
roosting In a damp wood amid toads and other
varmint. He scares away her enemies by blow-
ing the squeak which serves as Punch’s vocal
organ, and, though in low circumstances, he
nobly places the last drop of beer at her service,
and informs her that he and the missus and the
kid and the dog will never abandon her. He
is as good as his word, too, and at every
crisis in her fate he comes softly stealing rouad
the corner like a holy hymn in a dirt-coloured
overcoat, and after refreshing his memory by
spitting on his hands, he lets himself out against
the chest of the enemy with a crash. There Is a
wild convulsion ot dirty boots, squashed hat, and
dlseased-pig-tinted overcoat; collars and cuffs, bits
of Baker, and f ragments of Baker’s dirty pal from

her artificialities have bseu rubbed off and her

had tried to go round the corner without a dry

they deserved. Two members of the company—

wasn’t under the patronage of Lord Caringtcn The
Hon. Ingas, however, made a few remarks, after
which the band of the First Regiment let some
music out of itself, and a swimming contest took
place. The building comprises a concert-hall to
accommodate 2000 persoos artgiller/, organ loft,
refreshment-stall, fish-tanks, lawn, seal-pond,

Owing to the washy condition of outward
things the brilliant show which should have been
he’d at the Ash field Recreation Ground and
Garden Palace, during the holidays, has been
postponed till to-night (Thursday). A cycling
display by electric-light, a concert with the Naval
Artillery Band pounding its immortal soul out on
the big drum, and blowing its vital organs into
sundry wind instruments, a huge firework display
by Pain, and 3000 lamps to light up the grounds,
together with faollltes for all the civilised wo Id

three of its legs, are a few of the features of the

Melbourne shows were rather on the loose
all last week, and if The Bulletin wasn't
bubbling over with good will towards men it
might say something derned unchristianlike about
some of ’em. But it is better to drown bit ter
memories in the wassail bowl—to forget and
forgive everything except Simonsen’s Italians,
who didn’t sin and therefore need no repentance.
Those distinguished f urriners will trill and quaver
for ihree more weeks at the Alexandria, and then
they sat sail for Naples, where black-haired trou-
badours live on penny ices, and pallid
macaroni hangs despondently out to dry
from bedroom windows, along with blankets and
the week’s wash. To properly appreciate the
subtle flavours of macaroni one must go to
Naples. But this is beside the question. Boxing
Night was to hail something new at the temples
of art. “ Jack and the Beanstalk ” at the Royal,
“Erminie” at the Princess’s, “Sophia” at the
Bijou, and joys unspeakable in the minstrel de-
partment. There is no change at the Opera
House, where a deep-chested crowd is wallowing
in the wild wickedness of a cussed crimey
drammer called “ Current Cash.” When this was
produced in Sydney, the Nooze and the Herald
liked it so much that the management wisely put
their notices in pickle for the Melbourne public to
swallow if they will. And, at Christmas time,
every description of current trash is swallowed
greedily. (To be continued in our next.)

Fanny Liddiard returned by the Zea»

A certain Sydney
manager upon going
behind the scenes of h a
theatre, the other nigtff,
found there a masher
talking to some of the bal-
let-girls. The man ager re •
quested the masher to quit, which he did, and
the former then learnt that the latter was very
riih, and a good patron of the theatre. “I don’t
care,” said the Thespian tyrant. “If he was as
rich as C reosite, he don't come behind my scenes. ”
From Friday m'ght until Tuesday morning all de-
livery of mails was suspended throughout the
colony of New South Wales, and this in a country
where traios are running for the major part of the
time to adjacent colonies, with which business
is hourly being transacted. This may be the New
South Wales Postmaster-General's notion of buei-
| ness, but he should recollect that a letter-delivery
is not like a gin-mill. You can close a bunghole
ia a whisky cask without much harm being d ne
to anybody ; but it is different with a post-office
delivery window. People can lay in their stock of
glucose and ius -1-oil and compound concentrated
essence of damnation on Satutday night, but you
cannot go to the letter-shop as you can to the
grog-shop and lay in a supply ot correspendence
to last over the holidays It ia all nonsense to
talk about the postman. The country is not so
mean as to refuse to pay for relays or shifts in
limes of great pressure. The fault lies entirely
with the management. Probably Mr. Roberts
is anxious to throw a sop to the Civil ssrvants
whom his master Parkes has recently so greatly
offended. This little game is evidently in the
interests of the official body, not in the interests
of the men who trudge round in red coats for a
meagre enough wage. There is no occasion to
stop all public business to curry favour with a
section of the community recently unjustly out*
raged by the Government, and the sooner Mr,
Postmaster-General Roberts learns that the
G.P.O. is not absolutely on all fours with the
public houses the better for the security of his
billet.

David Henry —a distinguished gentleman
acquainted with a person who has a Liend that
occasionally makes advances in money for a small

about the 7th January. David has been seeking
relaxation from business cares in America, for a
weary, weary time. Pass the Jews’ harp :
O 1 mashers in Government offices,
O ! fast going fledglings in banks,
O ! money-from-home-getting novices,
Who get up to lunatic pranks ;
O 1 squatters not come to maturity.
Friend David is crossing the main,
And, if you find proper “ shecurlty,”
No doubt he’ll assist you again.
Control your Impatience—for presently,
Once more from the old offlcs-chair.
He'll smile at his clients so pleasantly,
With a father-and-motherly air ;
He’ll joke you about all your capers, and
Say “coin is exceedingly tight” ;
Then probably pass you some papers, and
A pen will put everything right.
Sing hey, then, improvident novices,
For David, the friend of the J. ;
Make haste to implore his good offlcss
To drive all your troubles away ;
Provide him with proper “ shecurity ”
Some deeds or another “ good ” name—
And don’t let a thought of futurity
Prevent you from playing the game.

They were going over the municipal ac-
counts in a Western Council, and the aldermen
were lost amid a labyrinth of police-rates, water-
rates, lighting-rates, cleaning-rates, dog-tax,
horse a’sessmeats, and the like. At last the
Council came to the surface of the accounts to
breathe, and an Irish member “shtruck the flure,”
and suggested that in future “ all them oitems
should be brought undher wan dishlinot
nucleus.” As he spoke another knowledgeable
jintilman opposite fixed a pitying eye on
the descendant of the ould Munster kings,
and, when he had finished, the other man
rose. “ It’s fokis y’mane, Oi’m thinkln’,” he ob-

that these two circumstances combined, also each
of them viewed singly, or regarded in connection
with the other, or any of them viewed anyhow,
may be considered as a ‘ happy augury” for the
future life of the squalling infants. P'raps so I
Who knows? The Jordan is about as big as the
Yarra, but it lacks the comprehensive atd well-
preserved stinks of the Dirty River, and the street
which is called Straight is a corkscrew way, laden
with garbage, and only about wide enough for a bull
to turn round. But it doesn’t take much to pile up
the enthusiasm of a pious paper, and so the N Z,

The prize curse r and swearer of the N.Z
Assembly has been suddenly and silently anni-
hilated, and his flow of cheerful Billingsgate is
heard no more. A few days ago Henry Smith
Fish, M.HR,, was a raging terror in the House,
but a certain large, peaceful, sleepy, silent mem-
ber—a sort of legislative cow ruminating in the
shade —went for him, and the squashed and
trodden-on Fish became a shapeless mass. There
was no row, either, and no abuse ; the sleepy,
bob-tailed country member did not speak, and
when the trouble was over he peacefully dozed off
again, but now Fish will stop in the full blast of
his profanity and sit down whenever the bumpkin
statesman oawdles into the House and lucks at
him. There is a great calm in the Lower House
now that Fish is abolished, and the men who
used to get up excitedly and state that Mr. Fith
Smish was a disgrace to the country, and who
never could get' he name right when they were in
a hurry, are having a rest. And all th’s time the
man who extinguished the frothing cf Fish’* exu-
berance preserveshisholycalmand puts onnofruD,
bat whenever the uproarious paperhanger starts
on a new crusade he wanders over to him, and
s’ts down by hla side and weeps. He never
speaks, bat he looks at Fi f h with a world of
speechless sorrow In his eyes, and large tears ro
down his cheeks, and when the rowdy house-
decorator makes a j eke his sobs become audible.
When he can’t get a place alongside Fish, he rears
his towering frame behind him, and snnffles in his
ear, and drops the evidences of his woe on Fish’s
head. The prize Billingsgate? of the House
presently begins to lose his sanses under this in-
fliction ; the patient misery of the man alongside
is too much for him, and he collapses ignomini-
ousiy. It is a good dodge, but it wouldn’t work
in Australia. PM'tlcians who are acustomed to be
stunned with a club don’t appreciate silent grief.

The narrow, debasing theory that a horse
can’t ba a Christian has had its day, and it is
time for it to give place to a nobler and more en-
lightened doctrice. We have ourselves seen
many a horse that has a bet’er prospect of going
to heaven than a lot of men we could name, and,
for the sake of a goed show in the He-eafter we
would rather bs a moke than a politician any day.
Apart from other evidenoe, however, our theory
of a horse’s Christianity is sufficiently confirmed
by what happened the other day to Ah Suey’s
A FISH STORY.
MR. NOODLETOOZY (who always makes a point of “ noticing" children): “WELL,
CHARLEY, MY FINE BOY, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO, TO-DAY?”
CHARLEY: “FISHIN’.”
MR. N.: “FISHING! USUAL FISHERMAN’S LUCK, I S’POSE?”
CHARLEY: “NO FEAR! WHY, I CAUGHT A GREAT BIG FLATHEAD. OH, AN
AWFUL BIG ONE! HE WAS AS BIG AS—WHY, HE WAS ACTUALLY AS
LONG AS YOUR FOOT!”
dead body, at Reedy Creek (Vic.). Suey had sud-
denly croaked, from causes unknown ; perhaps he
had boen eating some of his own cabbagee, for the
ways of Providence are mysterious, but th f s point
doesn’t signify. At all events, he was gone, so
the local Melville put him in a coffin, and the
coffin in a cart, and started to drive him to the
cemetery. Ah Huey’s pal, executor, adminis
trator, assign, and sole heir, Jimmy Ah Kow, sat
wseping and chewing tobacco on tip of the coffin,
and the procession moved along like a cheerful
symphony. The horse didn’t know the degrada-
tion that had bean put upon him. He was an
elderly animal of dauntless courage and great
velocity, and he had sat down on bis tail so often
and so hard that there was only a little stubble
left at the end of his backbone. If the Chow
in the cart had only kept quiet, things
might have gone on all right to the
end, but the Chow who cm keep quiet
hasn’t yet been born, and presently Ah Kew
commenced to jaw fond endearments to the de-
ceased in the box. Then the horse, which had
been moving along with the stately stride of an
emperor drawing a hand-cart, suddenly stopped,
a look of astonishment passed over its face, and it
turned round and fix=da reproachful gaze on its
owner. From him it glanced at Ah Kow, and
then it braced itself np, atd, with a heave that
nearl/ heaved its immortal soul out into ihe
middle of the road, it landed the loathsome
foreigner in the dust. Another noble effort, and
the coffin shot 20 feet in the air and came down
on the chest of Ah Suey’s executor with a whop
like an earthquake. It was the worst shock that
James Ah Kow had ever experienced, and when
his breath returned he raised his voice and
walled, “ You muchee go to hellee ! Take off um
box I Ah Suey no bloomin’ gocd ! Me no billy
him any mole! Pitch him col pee over
fencee! ” When at last the remains were
removed from the top of Kow, that yellow
imbecile got up and walloped his dead rela-
tive with a log till he was hauled off, and finally,
he refused to follow the deceased any farther, and
sneaked home through the twilight sobbing and
carrying his eye in a brown paper bag. As for
Ah Saey, he was thrown in o a grave without any
ceremony amid the unseemly laughter of the herse
that had chucked him out, and the splintered
wreck of the coffla was bundled in after him,
while his soul, if he had a soul, dusted serenely
along the heavenly road to sleep ultimately with
the spirits cf h’s fathers, where their pig tails
wave in the breezo which blows upon the
shores of the crystal sea. This little moral reflec-
tion is inserted, of course, on the off-chance that
Ah Suey had a soul, but if he hadn’t the horse
which dropped him on top of his countryman, cer-
tainly had.

At Koroit (N.S.W.) recently a teamster
was fined 20s. for driving a wcol-waggon through
the town on Sunday, contrary to the Act of
Charles the First of blessed memory, who lost hla
head. Of course Charles, even while he had a
head, d'dn’t intend the Act to apply to Australia,
for he never knew that there was any such place,
but that doesn’t count The English Parliament
never repeals any of these imbecile laws of the
past, consequently there are enough old Acts in
existence to prevent a man doing anything at all,
and the older and the more stupid the Act the
more Attorney-General Wise respects it as a
venerable snag of antiquity. Under these circum-
stances, we have resolved on taking a serious
step iu order to bring about a reform. We intend,
in the first place, to get hold of a promising Irish
youth of simple aspect, and send him to Oxford,
there to be stuffed by bores with erudition and
miscellaneous ’ologies, until all the information of
the past is festering in his ring-barked brain.
Then we will bring him out to Sydney and get
him made a policeman, and he will walk his
weary “bate” and try his best to look like a
plain, common, mean, ordinary, unenlightened offi-
cer, until, in a thrilling moment, he sights a drunk
conducting himself contrary to the provisions cf
some unrepealed enactment passed in the reign of
Harold Barefoot or Canute the Hardy, or busting
up the “ statoots ”of King Stephen. Upon this he
will straightway proceed to enforce the mangled
code, and about noon the next day that astonished
drunk will be put into a suit of armour and
mounted on a cart-horse and ordered to prove his
innocence by trial of bade in George-streat,
Sydney, with the Mayor for an antagonist, while
the Inspector of Nuisances blows a big trumpet
and Baron Carington acts as judge of the field.
Meanwhile a suspected perjurer will be trying to
prove his innocence by staying under water longer
than the officer who made the charge, and George
Rignold will bo solemnly carried out of town on a
rail under the Act which declares all actors to be
vagabonds and public nuisances One policeman
stuffed with antiquarian lo?e could make more
racket in Sydney in a week than the city has ever
before seen in 12 months.
The ugliest man in the known world is an
Eastern prince. Conscious of his misfortune, no
looking-glasses were hung in his pilace. Visiting
a neighbouring prince, the ugliest of men was ac-
companied by his vizier, and they came face to
face with a mirror, when both burst into tears.
“ Moderate your grief, my faithful friend," said
the prince, “ you see lam quite resigned.” “ Oh,
it is not that, my noble master,” replied the vizier,
“ you have only seen yourself for a single Instant
—I have to look at you every day.”
At a recent N.Z. rcai-boird meeting,
the chairman placed a bank-book on the table,

he cried, as he noticed the overdraft, and read the
amount out load, “ where, in the name of Roths-
child, has all the money gone to 1” The chairman
clutched the book, and looked at the cover.
“ Bhoys,” he said solemnly, “ keep it dark. This
is my own bank-book. You now know my posi-
tion. Come and let’s have a drink before we
begin business.’ And they went out ard drank
success to the O.D.

An old-fashioned English solicitor came
before Sir Redmond Barry once as a witness, and
in cross-examination was asked where he was on
a certain date, “Am I obliged to answer the


question, your honor?” “Certainly,” “ Well, I

“In other wards,” said counsel, “you were in
gaol far debt.” “Yes.” “Avery polite way of
putting it,” sail his Honor, who was himself the
pink of politeness.

Marcus CLarke nude one or tvo strange
errors in his first ver ion of “ His Natural Life.”
There are two version?, one published in the
Australian Journal 1 ' and theother in book form.
In the former, in describing Me bourne and things
in ’55, he alludes to the “ disreputable ante-cham-
ber” to the Th’a re R >yal. Bonne street,
“ known as the vestibule.” It was not till '6O, or
thereabout, during the tenancy of. Spiers and
Pond, that the entrance hall to the theatre was
named the vestibule, and it was so named by E.
P. Kingston, brother to the globe-trotter and
afterwards agent for Artemua Ward.
The Archbishop of Canterbury (£15,000
a year paid quarterly, and two palaces) is of
opinion that the lot of the 600.000 starving suf-
ferers cf London “ might be alleviated by spiritual
consolation.” He also gave an entertainment the
same week to a number of earls and countesses,
&o , at which claret-cup, champagne, ices, straw-
berries and cream, and the like ware served up on
the lawn. Wh-n Canterbury entertains the peers
of the realm, it will be observed, he doean t alle-
viate their lot by “spiritualconsolation ” Liquor
is more in their line than a chapter from the New
Testament, telling how the Lord hadn’t one red
cent in Galilee.
When Commander Cameron, the explorer,
after his return from Central Africa, was dining
with Marshal MacMahon, he thought it polite to
speak on geographical subjects. As the Marshal
had never heeded geography, save for military
purposes, since he was a boy, he sooa got out of
his depth. Talking of Australia, he said : “What
a prodigious country, to be sure 1 I remember
when its capital, San Francisco, was like the
babe unborn 1” This was in the smoking room.
The Vioomte Emmanuel d’Haroourt whispered,
“ Melbourne, Marshal —San Francisco is in Cali-
fornia.” “With all my heart,” cried the host.
“ Let it be in California, since you say so. Parole
d'honneur I ce brigand d'Harcourt sait tout!"
Such a sensation was never witnessed in
the new Law Courts, at Melbourne, as on that day
when young Dick M'Dermott —»ga, 19; weight,
eight stun ; height, 4ft llfn. in his socks —went
round the courts and offices thirsting for the blood
of poor Purves, Q C,, of the colossal intellect and
manly frame. Little Mac's father, Townsend
M'Dermott, had been, as alleged, insulted by J.
L. P. in the robing room. Townsend is now
getting on to three score and ten, and young Dick
undertook to do the punching as proxy. The pair
at last met outside the library in the quadrangle,
but the mill didn't come off. and half-a-dozen
spor bin g barris f ers, wh o had slid rou d the corrid ors
to have a quiet look at the contest, want back to
Court weeping.
Messrs. F. E. Rogers, C. E. Pilcher, and
“Jack” Want, who have just taken “Silk,”
were told by the N.s.W. Chief Justice that he
was glad they had done so, as it made way for
pome of the briefless juniors to earn a crust.
Which means that if any unfortunate suitor
requires the services of either of the distinguished
triumvirate he must employ a junior counsel with
him, as etiquette demands that a Q.C. shall eod
appear alone in court When the late Judge
Fellows (Vic ), was at the bar Sir William Stawell
told him he ought to accept aproffe*ed judgeship,
as he monopolised the chief business cf the courts
and kept other good men back Fellows took the
hint, but not until Government had increased the
salaries of the judges. Protection with a ven-
geance.
Wilson, the night-soil contractor of Auck-
land (N.Z,)— strange as it may seem —is an accom-
plished musician. Once upon a time he owned a
rare old fiddle —a genuine “Strad,” it was sup-
posed to be. When his Royal Sordidness, the
Dake of Edinburgh, was in the colony, some tuft-
hunting toady borrowed the violin from Wilson
and lent it to the Duke. It was such a capital
instrument that once the Duke had got it he could
not find it in his heart to part with R, and the day
the Galatea sailed he had not returned it. Where-
upon Wilson chartered a waterman’s boat, boarded
the Prince’s vessel, and gave H R.H. such a
tongue-lashing before the local magnates who had
come off to do a valedictory grovel chat the un-
happy German was ody to o glad to hand over the
instrument.
Sir Robert Molesworth, ex Justice of
Victoria who retired from the Bench about two
years ago with a pension and a knighthood at the
age of 80, and whom days were thought to be
numbered, has bec.me quite rejuvenated. He
has been devoting all h's spare time to novel
reading, and now the gay young spa k fa going
in for dancing and comic singing The other
night Robert had a big party at his house in
Upper Hawthorn, and quite out-dii the lively
Judge Hickman, hla favourite child, in his
hilarity. Topp, the Equity man, who was out
there, says that old M >ley actually sung the
“Judges song” frm “ Trial by Jury,” and as an
encore gave the Chancellors ditty from “ lolan-
the.” Robert Wa’sh, the Crown Prosecutor, who
is an old chum of Sir Robert’s, declares he was
never more astonished in his life since he heard
the late Joseph Henry Daune sing one of Moody
and Sankey’s hymns.
Lika all working-men’s representatives
Charles Jardine Den—who was by trade a stone-
mason—when elected for the ultra-demoera'ic
constituency of Collingwood Flat (Vfc)
threatened to take his peat in the Assembly in .his
working clothe?, apron, and all; but when the
day came Don appeared In solemn black with kid
gloves to hide the horny hands out of which he
had made much political capital, in fact he looked
like a mute at a respectable funeral. He once
called a squatters’ Ministry a lot of political
“Shicers,” and when called to order explained that
he did not understand the meaning of the word.
Don scon, however, got tired of combining hard
work with legislation, and kept a litt'e tobacco
shop in big Bourke-street, near the House. He
soon after degenerated into a pub,, was said to
have shaken hands with wealthy squatters, but
eventually became played out, and died in
obscurity. Of his colleagues in that Pari ament
one—John Edwards, the younger—is dead, and the
other Geor ge"Milner Stephen—is faith healing in
London.
POLITICEAL POINTS
N.S.W. is to remain N.S.W. So Park es
says. God save Australia!
Signs of the times. The present N.S.W.
Government are giving away billets as fast as
possible.
N.S.W. is just now spending less loan
money than before. It is intimated, however,
that she ia going to spend a little more land-money!
Nothing can be more charming than the
serious manner in which a certain N.S W. legis-
lator always assure ! the Speaker, in the broade-t
Scotch, that he Js a Scoatchmon.
The four curses of N.S.W. The Parkes
Government of land-jobbers, the Chine-e, the rab-
bit plugae, and—greatest curse of all—she apathy
and ignorance of the natives of the colony.
In the N.S.W. Assembly last week the
dreary Wall arose to call attention to the presence
of leprosy in Honolulu. But somehow nobody
took any notice of Wall. The House is accus-
tomed to worse things than leprosy.
Billingsgate Fish, of the N.Z. Legislature,
has struck a new refinement of the English
language. In speaking of the Upper House
he described it as “ that other place to which I
refer but which I must not allude to.”
The New Zealand Ministry have reduced
their salaries by £3OOO. The Premier now re-
ceives £lOOO, and his Ministers £BOO a year.
A MARKED MAN.
LOQUACIOUS BARBER: “YOU MAYN’T REMEMBER ME, SIR, BUT I HAD THE
PLEASURE OF SHAVING YOU WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO SYDNEY—A LONG
WHILE AGO!”
CUSTOMER: “INDUED I YOU MUST HAVE SHAVED SO MANY FACES SINCE THEN,
THAT IT SEEMS STRANGE YOU SHOULD RECOLLECT ME, IN PARTICULAR!"
BARBER: “AH! YES, BUT I NEVER FORGET MY OWN PARTICULAR RAZOR-
MARKS!”
Parkes, in his scheme of retrenchment, leaves his
own colleagues’ salary at about double the New
Zealand rate.
NtwZealand is the only Australasian colony
which cares nothing what New Sou-'h Wales calls
herself; bu% shuuld Parkes put a 'ax on dairy
produce, then Maoriland will arise and give him
a taste of reciprocity with a “ dooty ” on coal.
In the course of Premier Parkes’ recent
lectureon “Parliamentary Government,” he stated
that the President of the United States possesses
more absolute au'hority than even George 111. in
his most despotic days. This isn’t lying. It is
only ignorance.
Colonel Tottenham, a Tory landowner in
Ireland, has been screwing £lB a year out of a
poor tenant whose rent was recently reduced to
£2 s’. by the Royal Commissioners. Sixty per
shent fades into ins'gniflcance beside such an
extortion as this.
One of the early N.Z. Ministries was
known as the “ White Shirt Ministry,” because
Mr. Thomas Forsaith, the Premier-expectant, on
being hastily summoned by the Governor, craved
a few minutes’ delay, until he and his colleagues
had put on “ biled shirts.”
We learn that when the Yic'orian Speaker
formally presented Governor Lech with the Appro-
priation Bill for 1887-88 “ His Excellency duly
assented to it,” Considering that it included the
Governor’s special appropriation of an extra £6OOO,
we guess he cordially assented.
A British grand jury appealed the other
day to have Mr. Triumphant Democracy Car-
negie Imprisoned for writing that volume. Con-
sidering that Mr. Carnegie is an ironmaster
resident in the United State?, the appeal seems
peculiarly asinine—even for a British grand jury.
The Recorder refused to take the case up.
Mr. Carter said. In the Victorian Assembly
a short while ago, that “ he had read the history
of the world since the teetotaller Adam lost Para-

Eh, Mr. Carter ? You would have had a bad

Thus touches the S.M. Herald’s per
fnmed London “special” on the unemployed
difficulty:
There is a growing opinion that ere long both sides will
court a battle, and when that takes place there will bs an
end of the cap of liberty and the black flags for some time to
cone.
Just so. An end to the black flags, perhaps, but
not to the cap of liberty.
Says the Northern Miner :
The general election is looming nearer ; the party cries are
numerous and various; the Freetraders and the Protec-
tionists are already lifting their banners. But there are
more important issues before the country than any trade
questions. The question whether Queensland—whether
Australia shall remain a mere appanage of England, a rub-
bish heap, to shoot her diseased poverty and crime; a fat-
tening paddock for her used-up diplomats to browse in, and
wax fat as colonial Governors ; or whether this and the
other colonies shall effloresce into the full bloom of that
national life already stirring into activity in every nook and
corner of Australia.
All of a sudden Germany finds that she ia
unprepared for war. The repeating rifle with
which hsr infancy has only recently been
thoroughly re-armed, is now found to be of too
large a calibre, heavy, clumsy, and impracticable,
as compared with the lighter, better-finished, and
more deadly weapons with which the French and
other European nations have been providing
themselves. Her whole vast armies must be
re-weaponed, at an enormous expense, and an
inevitable de’ay. Not even the stocks of the old
rifles cm be used. Germany, therefore, can not
afford to go to war at the moment in the face of
such an enormous disadvantage.
The NZ. arliament is beginning to pro-
test against the constantly-recurring item, “ Re-
pairs to Ministerial Residences.” “Sardine-
opener, &c., 95.” is one of the things they kick
against, also “false bottom for range, os. 6d.,”
an impression having got abroad that there is
enough false bottom about the Government with-
out paying for any more. “ Gas-fittings for
theatrical stage, £2 9s. lid.,” is also considered
rough, to say nothing of “hire of piano, £lO 15.,”
with “ hire of piano, £7 10a.” thrown in, and
“hire of piano, £8 0s 6d.," “hire of piano, £7
10s ,” “ hire of piano, £3 5a.,” “ freight on piano,
9s. 8d..” “packing piano, £110a.,” “ tuning piano,
1 05.,” into the bargain. “Child’s bath and rat-
trap, £1 Is. 6d.,” makes the Legislature boil over,
there being an impression abroad that the Minis-
ter’s child ought to be washed at bis own expense,
and if the nation must wash it in future the
squalling brat will probably be inverted under the
pump. “ Pink and gold breakfast-set, £3,” sug
gests that the Government likes to have its vic-
tuals comfortably, and “ rose for Director, 25.” is
a mystery which no one has yet fathomed.
Thus the Earl of Carnarvon at the recent
dinner given in his honour by the Imperialists of
the Beautiful Harbour :
I would have you know that we know your statesmen well
by name, and that we fully appreciate them. (Cheers.) We
honour them as the honoured representatives of your own
constitutional system—(cheers)—and I am sure that no party
or political feeling of those who are bound sometimes to
think differently upon public affairs will make it undesirable
for me to say that in the present Prime Minister of this
country you have one whose age, whose experience, whose
knowledge rf public affairs, well merit that he should be
known throughout the length and breadth of the Empire.
(Cheers )
When you read thia over carefully and prayerfully
you will discover that it makes mighty fine
sarcasm.
Francis Adam s' Novel, “Madeline Brown’s
Murderer.”
The S.M. Herald of a recent issue contained a
severe and absolutely unintelligent notice of a
lately-published realistic and sensational novel,
by Francis W. L. Adams, entitled “ Madeline
Brown’s Murderer.” Of course, the Herald un-
conditionally condemned it. Whisper but
the words realistic and sensation’ into an
English ear and visions ef Zola aid
his school, of Gaboriau, A, K. Greene, and Hush
Conway are conjured up. Mr. Adams’ book :s
certainly sensational, but so also are all the
notable successes in fiction cf to day the wide
world over. Realistic it is just as certainly, but,
somehow, critics of English nationality always
think of one sort of realism, and only one sort—
the realism of nastiness. Zola discovered
that durghills were profitable investments. He
consents to beep his nose over a cesspool fer
so much a sniff 1 . Adams, on the other hand, Is only
rea’iatic as an artist would be who painted the
nude figure. He suppresses nothirg essential to
his picture, but neither does he exaggerate in
order to pander to the depraved taste of chronic
libidiency. He is artistic throughout, his colours
are strong, his drawing vigorous and accurate.
The book enthrals. The study of detail involved
in its composition must have been immense. The
brood, essential generalities are given, but the
reader feels the wealth of mental vision in the
author of which he has reflee’ed in the novel
only the high lights and tense shadows. To the
superficial Philistine, Madeline Brown, the
heroine, ia an immoral, altmt beautiful, sorceres ;
to the student of character, she is the pure, un-
sullied child of Nature, ignorant alike of virtue
and vice, who blooms and expands like some rich
exotic of her own Southern land, indifferent to
society’s opinions or the cut and-dried logic of
systems of theology. She typifies the warm,
glorious, pantiog South, as her hard, dry, matter-
of-fact husband, Raynor, typifies the North, with
all its Yankee directness and narrow intensity.
There is antagonism throughout the book between
these two —the antagonism existent always
between artiflcialised man and virgin Nature.
The warm-hearted journalist, Stuart, the
enthusiast in art and life ; the cynical, human
Randall; the theologically-fettered Hildyard,
with hia spasms of assertive sensualism ; the de-
voted Florence, with her brooding sacrificing love ;
are all firmly and consistently drawn. The plot
is enchaining in its interest, and the workmanship
is that of a poet. If the book is not a success in
Australia it will be because it was produced in
Australia, and lacks that charm of meretricious
farnees which the distance-worshipping colonist
attaches to the spawn of the English press.
Men living in Australia who have, during their
residence in a colder clime (or owing to the
bad example set them by parents born and bred
in the Old World) contracted the habit
of feeding mainly on carbonaceous foods aredaily
issuing invitations to Death to come and take
dinner with them. Visit the house of any aver-
age Englishman, living in Australia, on Sunday
afternoon. “Me. Bull is asleep! Mr. Bull
cannot be disturbed ! ” You insist, and Mr. Bull
comes to Ue door, his stomach distended—like
that of an iguana’s after a gorge—with plum-
pudding and roast-beef. His eyes are bolting
dyspeptically out of his head, his cheeks are
bloated and puffy, and his breath is steaming out
of him tainted with his diurnal swill of whisky-
and-water. One day he runs to catch a tram !
Verdict, disease of the heart. Why not the
true cause, syncope, the scientific title for stomach
on the chest? People remark with surprise,
“ Mr. Smith is dead ; such a fine big man ! died
suddenly : just after eating such a hearty meal,
too ! Wonder what could have been the matter
with him ? ” The explanation of all the trouble
is in that “ hearty meal.” In 99 cases out of a
hundred of alleged, heart-disease, that much-ma-
ligned organ has been perfectly healthy, and fully
capable, withproper usage, of lasting out the ordin-
ary human span of life. The true complaint is usually
syncope, consequent upon the distension of the
stomach interfering with the action of the heart.
This reminds us that the pre c ent Lord Lucan, of
Balaclava fame, was brought up by his father on
the Cornarian principle. He is now 87 years old;
he has served in the British Army 71 ye*rs, and
he has lately been raised to the rank of field-
marshal. His father, the late Lord Lucan, found
himself at the age of 60 a victim to heart disease,
the result of a life of carelessness and dissipation,
but managed, by adoptirg at that advanced age
the Cornarian method of existence, to prolong
his life 30 years, dying at the ripe old age of 90.
According to the theory of Cornaro has the pre-
sent Lord Lucan lived since his cradlehood. Ho
takes but little food, and that little accurately
measured out to him day by day. He is now pro-
bably the most active man of his age in England,
and this is the result of having lived scientifically.
Of course, it may he objected that existence by
the method of Cornaro would be the existence of
a vegetable. A man would be the absolute slave
of habit, Very good, but would such existence
not be preferable, after all, to the greasy life of boa-
constrictor repletion and gorge, which so many
pursue and which unfits a man entirely for the
discharge of the duties of life and frequently results
in premature death? Certainly, it is better to
live the life of a vegetable than to live the life
of a h-'g ! __
lb is better to take a bed at a good ho tel,
or even to put up at Government House, than to
go to sleep on the Melbourne wharves. A labour-
ing gentleman by the name of Davies sank down
to slumber on Queen’s Wharf the other day, and
when he woke up he had no boots. The wonder
is that he had any legs. There are chevaliers of
Industry who haunt those wharves who. if they
had found him, would have thought nothing of
robbing him first, drowning him afterwards, and
subsequently claiming a reward for finding the
body, and winding up by stealing it from the
morgue and selling it to the medical students for
dissection. Very thorough in their work are
these gentlemen. Mr. Davies ought to consider
himself a very fortunate man.
General Sir George Stoddart Whitmore,
commandant of the N, Z forces, resigns at the end
of the year and goes to England to write a book
on the Maori War. General George is a little
1201 b man with a nose “ tip-tilted like the petals
of a flower,” but he is true grit. The way he
harried the natives in the Arawera campaign was
a caution and made the Imperial forces green with
envy. He would take his corps of hardy bushman
into the forest-clad mountains for weeks, all the
provender being a little flour and what pigs they
could catch. On one of these expeditions an
officer suggested that the column should return to
the coast as the men were worn out and some
of them infested with vermin. “ Lousy, sir, are
they ? ” said Whitmore, “ Damn it, so am I! It a
honourable to be lousy in pursuit of the enemy.
Devil a step do we go back till we have a slap at
Te Kooti.” And Whitmore had his way, and his
persistence and courage led to the complete sup-
presion of the rebellion on the East Coast.

When the dulcet voice of the milkman is
heard beneath the eaves of Sydney Government
House with his long-drawn yowl of “Milk!”
Lady Carington’s sweat face packers up into a
frown which gradually melts away, end Is suc-
ceeded by a smile, for she cannot but feel all a
patron’s interest in any and every milk-cart in
N.S W. Nearly everyone has heard of her lady-
ship’s rheumatiz, but few know the origin of the
complaint which has furnished so much “ copy ”
to the sasaiety papers, and it is worth recording,
for it is the history of a wife’s heroic devotion. It
was at Moss Vale, The Governor was expected to
come hurrying up from the South in hot haste, so
the proud vice-regal steeds were brought forth
from the proud vice-regal stable and clothed with
their proud vice-regal trappings. But the
steeds, notwithstanding their noble birth
and their haughty lineage their great
grandfather had been an Abigail, which, being
translated, means 200 per shent— refused to “ git,”
and the coming hum of the train smote upon the
ears of the pampered menials and they looked at
each other and grinned. Nearer roars the
Southern train, more petrified become the haughty
steeds of noble lineage, more exasperatingly
albeit passively satirical the pampered serving-
men. Lady Carington was in despair when a
milk-cart hove in sight and brought solace to her
heart She hailed that milk-cart and arranged with
the humble swain that handled its steering-gear
to be driven to the railway station. In mounting
the high and difficult step Lady Carington in-
jured her knee. This is tbe origin of the vice-
regal rheumatism. It will be remembered that
Lady Brassey once rode in a vegetable-oarb, and is
now regarded as the patron saintof the coster frater-
nity in Australia, much in the same manner that
Lady Carington is held in sacred estesm as the
patron saint of the ohalk-and-water brotherhood.
We think that henceforward no milkman with
any sentiment of chivalry, any capacity for
knight-errantry would be guilty of an ignoble
or plebeian sin—such as watering the milk, for
Instance, or leaving the lid of a can on
the cart seat when a shower of rain is
falling. There is, however, in this connection
something truly inexplicable. Lady Carington
is popularly suoposed to lead fashion, and jet
we have seen no wives of wealthy Potts Pointers
riding in milk-carts. Perhaps they did all their
milk-cart work years agone, and are not now
anxious to revive that flower that bloometh when
Autumn’s leaves are shed.

Governor’ Carington, when on a recent
visit to Maitland, N.S.W,, wore a simple citizen's
walking costume ; the aide-de-camp, who accom-
panied him, was togged out in a’l the aluminum-
ated radiance of a tabbed uniform, epaulettes,
befrogged and e nbroidered j acket, sheeny lace,
sword, pipe-clay, red-ochre, and other molecules
of gorgeosity too numerous to mention. The
simple bucolic mind just wrapped itself in rap-
turous ecstasy around this radiant creature, mis-
taking him for Carington, and entirely lost sight
of the genuine Gub. Now, wouldn’t it be better
to run the vice-regal position purely on the fancy-
dress principle, and hire a man at so much a day to
wear the war-paint ?

fully equipped as a volunteer Lanoeab, one of the
crack corps whose glorious privilege id is to escort
Governor Carington through the streets. The
wonder is that anything so like the gim crack
Saturday soldier could be put to so profitable a
use, but the future possibilities of the lanceah,
considered in the light of a novel and telling

How the salt cf the earth c'inga together !
A Victorian J. P. walked into the shop of one of
his Melbourne tenants ard demanded three weeks'
rent. The shopkeeper had been paying up regu-
larly for six years, bo he pleaded for a little longer
credit from the dispenser of justice. Then the
great man waxed wroth, and declared (on his own
admission), “ I will have it out of you, or out of
your hide.” On the strength of this, the J. P. was
summoned for using insulting language, but the
Bench stood nobly by their order, and dismissed
the case with costs. Of such are the men who

while a troop of friends pelted the usual compli-
ments of blasd boots and the snowy Chinese
vegetable, at their heads. Another pair—mani-

tittered satirically as they watched the bride and
groom dimly visible thro' a shower of falling
missiles, supposed to ensure good luck in all sorts
of ways. The boat, however, in moving off,
turned round, and those misguided enthusiasts on

There comes a period In the life of every
fat man when the desire to get thin, and have
a waist again, posre-ses him with masterful in-
cessancy. He usually consults some other fat
man who has achieved in a degree the object of
his concentrated aspirations, The adviser has lost
several pounds in several months. Howdld-he
do it ? What was the formula he follow ed ? Was
it diet, or exercise, or boTi 2 All tk ese questions
a r e eagerly asked, and the aspirant toward the
s’ender graces of his youth sighs as he contem-
plates the martj rdom that lies before him. He is
lazy; he must take violent exercise. He is a
prodigious feeder ; he must be almost barmecidal
in his meals. He is fond of Icng toddies, and can
gu’p claret by the pint. Tte least possible indul-
gence in fluids of all kinds is most earnestly
recommended to those who wculd grow thin. No
wonder, then, the prospect looms up gloomily
before him. But, since he cannot button his
gaiters without severe bodily effort, and since his
friends have begun to accost him with that
familiar and most odious salutation “Hello, Fatty!”
he prepares himself for the sacrifice : usually the
fat man feels the impulse to shed a portion of his
superfluous flesh. In the spring a young man’s fancy
lightly turns to thoughts of love. In the autumn
the middle-aged and obese go in for a severe course
of training. There is a clique of fat men in every city
who exercise together, consult the scales together,
compare increase and and are wroth at
the intrusion of any lean man. They work like
heroes. They life, and twist, and run, dressed in
heavy flannels. Tcey get into machines of the
most tortuous character, especially devised for the
reduction of the abdomen. When they get on the
scales in the morning and note a pound off, their
plump faces are wreathed in smiles, If the truth-
teller should mark the other way, they begin,
with a piteous groan, to struggle again with the
machinery for flash destruction and muscular de-
velopment. This exercise, which is followed by a
cold shower-bath, induces, as a matter of course,
an enormous appetite. When the fat man steps
forth fresh and invigorated, the appetite of the
traditional ploughman is not a circumstance to his
overpowering desire for meab and wins. Nature
clamours for the replacement of the moisture she
has lost. He pauses for a moment before his
favourite restaurant. He sees within his cronies
with their napkins tucked under their chins,
gorging and guzzling in an ecstacy of gastronomic
bliss. He knows what the result will be if he
yields to temptation. The door is opened to admit
a guest. A breeze from the kitchen salutes his
nostrils. Flesh and blood cannot stand it, and in
a minute he is between the knife and fork, ready
for action, while a cooling pint of claret tickles
his parched throat. And when, filled to repletion,
he leaves the restaurant, he shudde"s to think
how the scales in the morning will proclaim to his
brother athletes the enormity of his sin.—Ex-
change.

can be found any night in the columns of the

“ Scabby ” Moffat, a well-known squatte*
of a bygone age, having built a palace befitting a
wool-king at his Hopkins Hill (Vic.) property,
offered the use of the establishment to ths Duke
of Edinburgh on the rccasion of that canny per-
sonage’s first visit to Victoria. Moffat was a bache-
lor, and earned his unsavory kogaomen from the
fact that his was one of the first (if
not the first) runs in the colony infected
with scab, which fact he carefully concealed.
This led to a well-remembered piece of election
doggerel—
“ Scabby is his rame,
And scabby is his pocket,
Scabby is the man
Who votes for Scabby Moffat."
The magnificent house which he built has au
entrance hall in which it is said a team of ten
bullocks, dray and all, can be turned. While
awaiting the acceptance by the Dake of his offer,
Moffat walked into the took-store of James
Caples in Collins-street, Melbourne, and, in'lmat-
ing that he had one room set apart as a library—
by the way, he could e either read nor write—pro
caeded to g’ve an order for books. Old Caples,
knowing he had a wealthy man in front of him,
after a profuse use of the snuff-box, made en-
quiries as to authors, bindings, &c , &c, but
Moffat did not wish to be pestered with any such
paltry details ; he gave a general order, very
concise, but which suited Caples to aT. “ Send
two ton, or thereabouts, and post the bill to the
clu\” Moffat died shortly afterwards at Point de
Galle on his return from England, never enjoying
the new house or the “ two ton."

You remember the old story about the
lady who complained of men bathing on the
beach in sight of her windows and, when they
went further away, said she could still see them
with a telescope ? Well, something not unlike |
ocourred in South Melbourne last week. Two
ladies sent a letter to the Council complaining of I
men bathing on the beach. It transpired that the
ladies could not possibly have seen the men unless
they had gone oat of their way to do so. Coun-
oilier Larkin stated that “in one instance, when
15 or 16 residents were about to enjoy a plunge in
a secluded locality, a lady deliberately planted
herself in the way, and the w'ould-be bathers had
to go without their morning dip,” She must
have been a perfect lady ! Thera is a good sug-
gestion hpre for enterprising advertisers. They
might pay some of these South Melbourne bathers
to let out their hides for advertising articles of
ladles’ apparel. In these days, when even the
face of South Head is used for advertising drapery,
it seems a pity to waste so much valuable space.

In her magazine, Dress, Mrs. Annie Jen-

* 1 our garters ”
Pour years ago we very reluctantly gave up a pair of spiral
wire garters, worn below the knee, which held our stockings
perfectly smooth, and did not interfere wi ■ h perfect circula-
tion, this spiral arrangement having no relation to the nerve
and muscle-paralysiug elastic garter. But we were told any-
thing worn around the leg was in the nature of a ligature,
and must he abandoned; so away went our comfortable and
satisfactory spirals, while we plunged into a mild form of
rioting in different styles and patterns of attachments re-
commended as "improved and hygienic.” We were seeking
truth in detail, and discomforts only added to our zeal to
find just the right thing at last. One after another of these
harnesses did we wear, until satisfied that none of them ful-
filled the requirements of a perfect stocking-support. The
stockings were held firmly? Yes; but every one of these
attachments brought pressure to hear somewhere where it
ought not to be, causing the wearer not only bodily discom-
fort, hut positive injury. Our advice to women is to have a
good, substantial silver garter of the spiral pattern made,
since the silver will wear for years and can always he kept
bright and shining; and as the gart-r gives readily with each
movement of the leg, h cool and light, and brings no steady
pressure upon any sensitive part, it is a great improvement
over anything else we are familiar with, and our knowledge
of supports is thorough and comprehensive.

Recent disclosures throw a little light
upon the value of a Melbourne University degree.
The tutor of a plucked candidate goes to the
examiner and points out that the plucked one is
connected with some of our most distinguished
colonists, and that there must have been a mis-
take made with his papers. Then the examiner
says: “ God bless my soul! I'll give the papers
more careful consideration.” Hitherto hidden
beauties are discovered in the candidate’s answers,
and he is passed right away. This is only an
official irregularity at the worst. But with re-
jected candidates at minor Civil Service exams.,
it is quite a usual thing to interview the Minis-
terial head of the department, and solicit another
chance. Then the Minister says, “Humph!
What’s your name ? Snooks, eh ? Any relation
to old Simon Snooks, of the Western District?
Nephew! Well, take this note to Mr. . . .
and I daresay he will enquire into the matter.”
These little things comprise the “ colonial ex-
perience,” without which many an unfriended
new-chum has to whistle for his daily bread.

Almost every woman is a snob at heart,

good old creature expressed a wish that two keep-

quilt given by the children of the United States,
the other an Indian silk shawl presented to her
by the Queen. The wonder is that a woman pos-
sessing such sublime faith in majesty didn’t ask
Pre eminence In Grief to give her an order for
Heaven. Then, on Judgment Day, Jenny might
have thrown the royal shawl across her shoulders,
and tripped up to St. Peter with the royal war-
rant—“ Admit bearer to the Kingdom. (Signed)
Victoria Regina et Imperatrix.” But it’s a shame
to chaff the memory of (he dead singer just be-
cause she went to church regularly, and found the

From an ear-witness we have a truly
painful account of the Dock of Manchester's
speech on board the Britannia. Before reaching
“our Beautiful Harbour” the Dook broke out
into after-dinner oratory. He desired the company
to charge their glasses and drink the gallant cap-
tain’s health. Everything went swimmingly for
the first three sentences, but after that the ducal
brain seemed to become addled, and His Grace’s
speech got mixed up with the British Empire and
the obliging stewards. By the lime the Dook
had finished not a soul knew whether he was to
drink the health of the captain, the stewards, or
the Empire, but as the Dook quite forgot to order
fizz for anybody besides the nobs the point wasn’t
argued out. Passengers in general filled the
bumper fair with cold water and drank “ Con-
fusion to dooks.”

Herr Kahler’s picture of the “Lawn at
Flemlngton on Cup Day” is giving much comfort
to the Melbourne aristocracy, estecially the
favoured sitters for portraits. Even to an unpre-
judiced eye the work is good—too good for such a
painfully unclassical subject. It is built upon the
unsubstantial basis of 1887 “fashions,” and will
excite little but ridicule in 1897. The abolition of
bustles and the re-introduction of trained skirts
would kill Kahler’s picture in twelve months,
we’re thinking. There has been no enduring
charm about woman’s dress for the last fifty years,
a statement which any young man will appreciate
after studying a picture of his mother painted
about her honeymoon period. Or let him try to
admire a photograph of the Princess of Wales,
taken when Albert Edward had wcol on the top of
his royal head. At the risk of distressing
the reigning beauties on Flemington lawn,
we must point out that actresses know better
than to “dress” thirty-year-old—aye, or ten-year-
old—comedies in strictly historical costume. Lady
Teazle may be fixed-up as she was in Sheridan’s
time, but nobody plays Lady Gay Spanker in the
garb worn when Boucicault didn't write “London
Assurance.” There’s a cough-drop for dear Lady
Loch and the rest of Herr Kahler's distinguished
customers 1 The apparently unchanging costume
of perfld'ous man is in almost the same bad way,
for who can now believe that Frith’s “Darby
Day" isn’t a vulgar caricature? A knight in a
plumed helm is a joy for ever, but a dude in his
stove-pipe hat is only a thing of beauty until
another variety of rim is introduced by the
hatters. We who write this are still fairly young
and charming, and quite capable of killing at ten
paces with our Sunday clothes on. Yet can we
remember the time when Edwin went a-mashing
in “peg-top” trousers that would, nowadays,

Victorians with a counterfeit presentment in fire-
works of the Russian Fleet at the Heads. After our
brave defenders at Queenscliff have shelled the
Fleet they send a Brennan torpedo right into the
Russian Admiral’s eye. Brook is now preparing
a grand allegorical device—the kangaroo sitting
on the Czar's stomaoh.

Dear Bulletin,— One feature of the Hughes-
Hallatt scandal seems not to have been even remotely
touched upon by the hundreds of newspapers—English and
Australian —which have considered it necessary to add to the
attractiveness of their columns by publishing a full, free, and
particular account of the entbe business. Everybody has a
deal to say about the terrible wrong suffered by Mrs
Hughet-Hallf tt, &c., &c., but nobody seems to consider that
Miss Balwyn bas anyone- but herself to blame ; in fact, very
small sympathy is wasted upon her at all. Yet, looked at
fairly and squarely, she is the only one who has suffered an
irretrievable injury, and that, too, through no particular
fault of her own. Caged up in an uncongenial atmosphere)
surrounded by a depressing!? Puritanical environment, living
with a relative whose harsh and Unsympathetic governance
was nigh unbearable, she naturally turned to this cultivated
man of the world, with his interest in her welfare, personal
and financial. Can she altogether be blamed ? Now she is
ruined, socially and matrimonially. Why? Simply because
she learned to love a man without first obtaining the s-< nti
fying mumble of society's white-tied and black-coated f< ti .
—the parson. The constant and inevitable recurrence of
these instances surely point to a re-estabiishment of the mar,'
riage state on some other than the present basis. Why
should not woman be made the civil head of the family ?
All Bills providing for the extension of divorce tend to un-
sanctify marriage, and to regard it more and more as a
purely civil contrivance and no speoially-benisoued scheme
of the Divinity. Let us scout the notion of the sacredness
of marriage in one drastic act, and institute the whole busi-
ness as a civil contract, and not a religious rite. And if a
contract, why not a contract for a term of years, or a term
of months ? Such a course would abolish, in one sweep,
wife-desertion, illegitimacy, divorce, &0., &c. Unions based on
a lasting sentiment would always be in vogue, and would, as
now, continue for the lifetime of the contracting parties,
only they would subsist on a moral, and not on a merely legal
basis. The State would then relieve the wife of all obliga-
tion to sue for the maintenance of her offspring by making
the husband accountable directly to the authorities. lam
convinced this is logical, and that it would work admirably,
only the Pharisees will persist in blinking everything that
s-sems antagonistic to the teachings of Modern Society.—
Yours, Skotoh.

They put it to a boy in Melbourne County
Court whether he knew the meanlcg of taking an
oath, and the youngster said “ Yes, don’t tell a lie
in court.” Most Australian boys have a much more
practical grip of the subject, and know that tak-
ing an oath means talking like father when the
dinner isn’t ready.

Some choice Langtij ana ;
When the contents of the little Langtry house in Park
Lane were sol'l, and tha social career of the famous Jersey
beauty came to an end, all the fashionable London world
gathered to the auction of her effects, and were considerably
surprised at the revelations of the luxury within that modest
little domicile. The house was small, but everything in it
was of the very finest and most expensive duality. The
damisk was as thick and shining as white satin, all the
beautiful Belfast ted linen was embroidered with a double
“ L," and many of the sheets and pillow-slips were edged
witn lace. The hangings, rugs, embroideries, and furnishings
were of the richest, and ad the domestic appointments ex-
quisitely dainty and costly This passion for luxury is an
integral quality of the beauty's nature. She can not exist
without it, and will have it at any cost. The moment she
settles dow i anywhere it begins in three days to show itself
in all sorts of charming adjuncts, and her New York house
was a perfect marvel of costly loveliness. Her piano was
draped with an India shawl, the card-trays and ash-receivers
were richly enamelled, the rugs were of the moat expensive
furs, the candlesticks of solid silver, Every detail, every
appurtenance, had an intrinsic money value apart from what
b. it possessed, and, as for her personal appointments,
they were fitted for the use of an empress. All the fittings
of her travelling dressing-case are in gold and the heaviest
cr. Rial, and ivory, shell, silver, and porcelain, made into the
dainty and luxurious toilet devices that only Parisians can
mauufactme, furnish forth her bath-room and dressing-table.
The same daintiness and splendour extend themselves to her
wardrote, Mrs, Lmgtry never wears silk undergarments,
but has an unlimited supply made of the finest and sheerest
of batiste. An order stnt home to her from a big importing
house, the other day, contained two dozen of everything,
made of batiste, in all tha delicate shades of blue, lilac,
pink, and cream, trimmed lavishly with crisp laces, and tied
with tiny ribbon bows of the same or c f contrasting colours.
The petticoats were, many of them, in colours also, though
the majority were white, and were flounced nearly up to tne
waist with many ruffles of lace and fine hand embroidery.
With this order, weich included night-dresses, dressing
sacques, and underwaists, were eighteen pairs of corsets.
These were of shades to match the underclothes, and, while
not v ry much trimmed, were of the thickest silk, and frilled
around the tops with lace. They are all made to order, and
are to wear with special dresses, giving different effects in
the length of the waist, &c. Mrs. Langtry is, as she
grows older, just a little inclined to embonpoint,
a consummation she dreads, and her corsets
are made, just now, with extra care to con-
ceal the tendency. She has measured her waist, just so
many centimetres, and her corsets are always laced to come
within that measurement every time she puts them on. She
looks very charming in her morning neglige, which consists
of a slate-gray Chinese rebe of China silk, lined with white
c. It is embroidered heavily with gold, and has the
hanging square sleeves and broad girdle of the Chinese
womans garb. She wears a little white and gold ’keich.ef
folded about her throat, and over this laps the robe showing
a little of the white beneath. She sticks a pearl-tipped dag
jer-pin in the breast of the dress, twists her hair in a loose
knot on top of her head and impales it with a golden shaft
tipped like the pin in her bosom. In it she does not look a
day over twenty-five.

ROW’S
Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend those BITTERS to be taken two
or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children.
For genera! Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of Dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day,
THEY PURIFY THE BLOOD AND LIVER.
SEE WHAT A MEDICAL GENTLEMAN SAYS
ABOUT THEM.

Gentlemen,—l have great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s D anellon Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them, —
Yours,
0. R. UPJOHN, J.P,
Tamworth, August 21, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned i—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“lam glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

object is to firmly inaugurate in Australia Henry George’s great scheme of Land Reform to d

circulation than any country paper in the colony, and reaches nearly every part of New South Wales.
It is smartly and fearlessly written, and every man who has the interests of his fellow-men at heart

Do not be Discouraged,
Even if you have tried many remedies for your
kidney disease or liver comp aint without success
it is no reason why you should think your disorder
incurable The most intractable cases readily yield
to the potent virtues of dr. bell’s bitters
It is a purely vegetable compound, which ac’s on
the kidneys, liver and bowles at the same time,
and thus clean?es the whole system. Don’t wait,
bub get a bo tie to-day and cure yourself
Sufferers from Rheumatism, Lumbago, Sciatica and
other analogous affections should try Freeman s Original
Chiorodyne, a m' diciue that has, since its introduction in
1844, been employed on a very large scale both by the
Wtdioal Profession and the Public iu every part of the
habitable Globe, with unvaried succes. Since its introduc-
tion into New South Wales the popularity of Freeman’s
Chiorodyne has been considerably enhanced, and is now re-
garded as the.mnst efficient and valuable medicine that has
ever bean Introduced into the Colony. The Profession pre-
scribait; Missionaries prefer and use Freeman’s Chiorodyne,
and people leaving any of the principal ports for the interior
it variably take a sufficient supply to last them a twelve-
month.—Sold i very where throughout the Colonies Insist

WOMAN NEVER THINK,*
If the crabbed old b“ chelor who uttered this sentiment
could lut witress the intense thought, deep study and
thorough investieaiion of women in determining tbs best
medicines to keep their families well, and would note their
sagacity and wisdom in selecting Dr. Soi le’s American Hop
Bitters at the best, and demonstrating it by keeping their
families in p< rpetuai hea'th, at a mere nominal expense,
he would be forced to acknowledge that such tentiments
are baseless and false. “ Picayune.’’

" I DON'T WANT THAT STUFF,”
Is what a lady of Boston said to her husband when he brought
home some medicine to cure her of sick headache and
neuralgia, which had made her miserable for fourteen years
At the first attack thereafter it waa.administored to her with
such good results, that she continued its use till cured, and
made so enthusiastic in its praise, that she induced twenty-two
of the best families in her circle to adopt it as their regular
family medicine. That “ stuff is Dr. Sou'e's American Hop
Bi ters. Standard.”
THE M.P. AND A CITIZEV.
An M.P. who had not long been elected was
called upon by a citlzan, who presented a petition
for a noble cause, at the same time bowing very
low to the new-made member. “How times have
changed,” mused the office-holder. “ A few
months ago you would not even notice me on the
fctreet. Now you bow before me.” “Make no
mistake," replied the citizen. “In Australian
politics we bow to the office, not always to the
man.” All the old politicians have long under-
stood this-just as much so as when they shouted
the famous St, Louis Lager Beer on election day for
their friends.
Commence th.3 Year Right.
Don't make too many resolution, but hold on
like grim death to those you do make If your
physical system is out of order you should attend
to that at once, for it’s no use trying to keep a stiff
upper lip when you kidneys or liver are taking the
courage out of you. If you lave really made up
your mind to turn over a new leaf, commence the
year by taking a thorough course of the celebrated
DR ball’s bitters. Thousands of people testify
to its goods eff eta for kidney diseases, biliousness,
piles, constipation, &c.

THE WATERBURY
THE MAN WITHOUT A WATCH
WORTHY AMBITION.
The Glasgow Evening News has the following
on a subject which is daily increasing in impor-
tance in all parts of the world:—“It is the
ambition of all working lads to carry a watch,
and there is no reason why it should not be grati.
fled. The lever is beyond their reach ; and, in nine
cases out of ten, so is the ordinary Geneva make.
They must have something considerably oheape r,
and the Americans, as usual, have solved the
difficulty. The watch of the Waterbury manu-
facture is cheap, and a few weeks’ savings would
enable your youngest artisans to purchase one.
It is a substantial piece of workmanship, has a
white enamelled face, is a good timekeeper, and
in size does not go beyond the ordinary silver
watch. The metal of the cases is nickel silver,
and the other materials of the watch are light and
durable. One of the chief features of the Water-
bury is that it is composed of less than one half
of the usual number of parts in the old style of
watoh, and the arrangement is so simple that the
whole apparatus can be easily cleaned or re-
paired."
The WATERBURY WATCH is a stem-winde r
ani will run 28 hours. The cam is nickel silver,
and will always remain as bright as a new silver
dollar. The watoh has a heavy bevelled edge and
crystal face. The works of the watch are made
with the finest automatic machinery. Every
watch is tested in varying positions, and is per-
fect before leaving the factory. Bach watch is
put up in a handsome new improved satin-lined
case, for safe transportation through the mails.
So well-known have these watohes become that
thousands are buying them In preference to high-
priced watches. The Company are now making
2000 watcees each day. You would imagine the
whole country was supplied by this time. By no
means. This is the Merchant’s Watch, the
Farmer’s Watch, the Traveller's Watch, the
Clerk's Watch, the Miner’s Watch, the Laborer’s
Watch, the Boy’s Watch, the Schoolgirl’s Watch
—in fact
EYERYBODY’S WATCH.
And everybody is buying it.

T. Willis and Co. ; Feldheim, Gotthelf, and Co. ;

LOST, IN GEORGE-STREET.
Somewhere in the vicinity of seven balls yester-
day forenoon a oomfoi table-looking man of the
agricultural species monopolised a large share of
the side-walk in George-street, opposite the
Markets. He had his wife with him, and an
inquisitive-looking boy about six or seven years
old. The grass seed was in the man's hair, and
the fragrance of the eucalyptus fallowed in the
track of the group as they wandered widely from
shop to shop. Then he met an old mate, and with
a curt “ You stop here old woman, I’ll be back in
a minute,” disapnearcd in the crowd. For a few
minutes she vibrated between three shops, and
then she missed the youngster, who, at that
identical moment, was worshipping at the shrine
of a dissipated-looking monkey on top of a wheezy
organ which was inviting the crowd to “ Gather
at the River.” The deserted wife and mother
created quite a business like stir in the street for
about 10 minutes, when a constable came to her
assistance. His instincts took him straight to the
boy, and by the time they got back to the try-
sting place the husband and father had arrived.
With a stony stare he surveyed the passers-by in
search of his loved ones. Then a familiar voice
reached him with an emphasis on the adjective,
and he modestly explained that he had not been
drinking, only “ me and Jim had a bottle of that
Clausen’s Lager Beer. It’s wonderful. Come on,
old woman, and we’ll go and have another.” But
when he heard of the delinquency of his son and
heir all the poetical justice of the man’s honest
nature was aroused “ So you left your mother,
did you sonny, to go for a monk oy ? and mo only
gone five minutes to see a friend. You’ll get toko
for yam for this, you see if you don't, the minute
I get you home, and you don’t come outside again
this Christmas till you go into the train.” The
stream of her reproaches was thus turned into
another channel, and as they vanished in the
direction of the promised nectar she had that
firm connubial grip of his arm wh’ch no tingle
man outside the force could sue essfudy ImiCat".
Burlesque Actress (on her way to the
wedding of a sister professional): “ Wake up
that horse, cabby. I want to be in time for the
wedding ; but if you drive at this rate I shall be
too late for the divorce I ’
Sadi-Carnot, the new French President,
is descended from the great Carnot, general, mili-
tary engineer, and Minister of the First Empire.
The Carnots are a race of soldiers, authors, and
scientists, and to a man they are staunch Repub-
licans.
In Siam some of the people eat day.
The same here. We call them land sharks.
Afterwards—when they take to talking of “ Lord
so-and-so who dined with ns the other day”—dirt-
eaters.
A nervous curate was struggling through
his first service, “Not one tit or iottle of His
word shall fail," he announced, as he mopped his
forehead, and there was a titter. “I mean nob
one tottle or jit shall pass away," he explained
hurriedly.

The
‘POTSHOT’
Camera,
m
IS the Latest Novelty in the Photographic World. It is small, strong, very simple, handsomely got
up, and atrociously effective both on friends and on enemies. Six circular pictures, each about the
size of a crown piece, can be taken on one plate with most astonishing speed and perfect accuracy.
This Camera can be worn under a coat or dress, the lens projecting through a button-hole cannot be
observed, and the simple action of pulling a cord hands down to either reverence or ridicule every
Incident included within the scope of its vision. The “POTSHOT” Camera is not a toy, but a
really serviceable instrument of the class known as “DKTKCTIVB” Cameras. At the same time
an immense amount of fun can be got out of it, and photographs of people and things obtained with
ease which are practically impossible by any other method. A limited number only have been
imported by us, and they are well worth the attention of the general public.

MR. LYNCH, MURDERER.
[A Psychological Study.]
One of the most grisly narratives in all
colonial history is the confession made by
Lynch, theN.S.W. murderer, to Mr. Bowen,
Police Magistrate at Berrima, upon the eve
of his execution for the assassination of
Kerns Landregan, in the year 1842. Lynch
was transported from County Cavan, Ireland,
In 1831 for 14 years for robbery, and arrived
in Sydney by the convict ship Dunvegan
Castle at the close of that year. His father
came in the same ship, transported for life
for manslaughter. In 1835 Lynch, junior,
was tried for murder, he having, with others,
beaten a man to death at Berrima, and thtn
burnt the body ; but the prosecution failed
by reason of the drunkenness of the chief
Crown witness. In 1842 Lynch was put on
his trial for the murder of Kerns Landregan,
of which crime he was convicted, and for
which he was executed. He condactel his
own case with self-possession, coolness, and
remarkable ingenuity. There is only one
parallel to the story of Lynch in all modern
history, and that is the story of the Thugs, as
told by Meadows Taylor N everthe less, Lynch
is described as having been a man with the
winning ways of a good fellow. He had an
eye to the sanction of the most respectable,
religious, and even kindly motives in the com-
mission of his most atrocious crimes, or when-
ever the pious opportunity offered. Here is
his confession ;
“ Lynch first minutely detailed the circum-
stances attendant on the murder of two persons
whom he met on the road, and whose company he
joined. These two persons—one a black boy—
wpre driving a dray belonging to Mr. T. Cowper,
laden with bacon and other articles for the Sydney
market. Lynch killed them with an axe as they
lay asleep, hid the bodies under a heap of stones,
proceeded to Sydney, and sold the articles on the
dray; and on his return up the country
in sole charge of this empty dray, he proceeded to
state, he fell in with two Frasers (father and son),
and thus describes his manner of making their ac-
quaintance and his mode of dealing with them :
“ ‘ While encamped (he states) at Holland's, at
the Stone quarry, the two Frasers came up with
Bawtree’s horse-team and dray. We sat together
by the fire, had a great deal of talk, and, as usual,
I told them as many lies as suited my purpose,
and managed to get from them an account of the
whole of their and their master's concerns, as well
as of the valuable load they had on. But I had
then no intention of doing them any harm. We
travelled together next day, and I was enabled to
afford them great assistance in getting on their
tired horses, for neither of them could drive well,
and I was clever in the management of draught
cattle. We encamped in Barg i Brush, by the
side of the road, and a cart with two men and a
woman afterwards joined us. When we were all
lying down, and, I believe, all but myself asleep,
a man on horseback rode up and made particular
enquiries about Mr. Cowper’s dray, describing it
exactly, and telling the whole history of its disap-
pearance, as well as that of the driver and the
black boy. I lay still and did not speak a word,
but Fraser, the old man, got up, between asleep
and awake, and answered something at random.
The rider then asked the distance to the nearest
inn, and went on. “Whew!” said I, “this is
sharp work —this will never do—l must get rid of
this dray and obtain another somehow.” I had
the whole night to think over the matter and to
form my plans. So in the morning I went under
the pretence of looking for my bullocks, but in
reality to drive them away into a deep gully.
I strangled the dog belonging to Mr. Cowper’s
bullock-driver, and stayed away long enough to
allow the other cart with the two men and the
woman to leave, knowing that the Frasers —who
seemed greatly to desire my company from the as-
sistance I could give them in managing their
teams —would wait for me. When I returned I
told them that my bullocks were nowhere to be
found, and I had no doubt they had gone to their
own home up the country beyond Berrima. I
consulted with them what I had best do, and we
agreed that I should leave my dray there, since it
was nearly empty, and go on with them for the
bullocks, as they offered to take the few things
I had on their dray. We encamped for this night
on a flat on the other side of Cordeaux’s Hill.’
“He did not tell me,” writes the magistrate,
why he allowed the night to pass without perpe-
trating the intended murder of the Frasers, but —
*ln the morning,’ said he, ‘ young Fraser went
over the ridge to get in the horses, and I volun-
teered to go with him and assist. It was cold, and
I put on a pea-jacket—not to keep me warm, how-
ever, but to conceal an axe which I held under my
arm. When I got up to young Fraser, I had no
difficulty in obtaining the opportunity I wanted.
I gave him one crack on the head, and he just
dropped like a log of wood. If people knew how
easy it is to take away life, things of this kind
would happen oftener. I then returned to old
Fraser, who remained with the dray, and began
yarning to him. After a time he began to wonder
what had become of “ Wully.” I had my axe all
right, but would not strike until I could make
sure. At last he turned his head, and down he
went. The next business to attend to was the
getting rid of the bodies. I dragged the old one
some yards out of the way, lest persons passing
through the flat might come upon it, and then re-
turned to the body of the son. With a spade I
got from the dray I dug a hole and buried him ;
afterwards I buried the father in the same
manner.
“ ‘ By the time I had finished, the day was far
advanced, so I thought it better to stop there for
the night. By the evening of the next day I got
to Mulligan’s. I had no notion of trusting them,
or indeed anybody, so I amused them with an ac-
count of my being hired to drive up the dray for a
gentleman in Sydney. The family consisted of
the old man, Mulligan ; Mrs. Mulligan, who lived
with him, but was not his wife ; her son, a lad of
about 18 ; and her daughter, a girl of about 11.
Mrs. Mulligan, seeing chests of tea on the dray,
said she was out of tea, and proposed to buy a
chest of me. At first I reminded her of the bad
faith they had kept with me before, but pretended
at length to bargain with her. But this was only
my craft, you should know, for I had no notion of
letting her have any of the property, I only wanted
to know how much money they had in the house.
She said they had £9. We did not come to any
agreement, but I let them hope they would get
some of my master’s property. The next day, in
the afternoon, I pulled out a note (£1), and sent
to Gray’s public-house for rum to treat them. In
the evening we drank together and got very
sociable, but I took care not to drink much. Well!
thoughts were in my head, and the time was
walked out of the hut. It was a clear, cold,
windy night ; I looked up at the bright moon, and
I prayed to Almighty God to direct me I I said
to myself, I am an injured man, and the Mulligans
have defrauded me of what I perilled life and
liberty to obtain. That fellow, when I was starv-
ing in the Berrima Iron Gang, has often passed
me by without so much as giving me a shilling,
when he had many pounds which were justly
mine in his hands. And now, would it not be
right that they should lose all they possess as a
judgment upon them for withholding his own
from the poor prisoner ? Heaven guide me and
point out to me what to do. Well, I went into the
house again, and we had another glass of rum
round. Now, it was a cold, windy night, so I
took up the axe and said I would go and cut a
few barrow-loads of wood for the fire, if John
(meaning the young man) would wheel them in.
We went out, and had some talk whilst I was
cutting up. He said that Mulligan was an old
man, that he should have the farm at his death,
and that God Almighty would soon take him away
adding, that if he did not he (John) would give
him (mayhap) a helping hand. I was shocked to
hear him speak in this way, knowing how near he
was to his own departure out of this world ; so I
said, “ Ah ! John, you should not speak in that
way, you don’t know what may be in store for
yourself.” At this time he had taken in two loads
in the barrow, and was come for the third. I had
just finished my work, so I took the axe, gave it a
backhanded swing against his skull, and threw it
down. I threw a quantity of boughs over the
body, and went back to the hut. We had another
glass together, and the mother inquired for her
son, I said he had offered to go into the bush to
see if my horses were right. After a time she be-
gan to wonder that John did not come back, and
to be very fidgety. This bothered me. She also
mentioned a dream she had the night before : she
thought she had an infant child, and that she had
seen this child horribly mangled and covered with
coming on; I began to feel very disturbed, and I

blood. I hated this old woman, for she used to
toss cups and balls, and could foretell things. Well,
nothing would satisfy her but she must go to the
door and cooey. She cooeyed for John, but no
John came : and at last she would not even drink.
Then old Mulligan said, “ Perhaps the lad is lost
in the bush,” and took his gun outside to fire, for
the purpose of directing him as to the position of
the hut. It did not suit me to have neighbours
drawn to the house, so I said to Mulligan, “ You
had better not fire ; people will come, perhaps the
police ; and if we are to deal it won’t answer that
the dray should be seen here.” “ Truth, lad,
that’s a right thought of you,” he answered, and
instead of firing folded his arms, holding the gun
with the muzzle pointing up. Well, there was no
quieting the old woman, and I had my eye upon her
inside, at the same time that I was standing by
Mulligan outside. I saw her take out a large
knife and conceal it in her own clothes, and then
give it to the little girl. There was no time to be
lost. I had left the axe on the ground when I had
cut the wood, but my own, with which I had such
good luck with the other four, was in the dray ;
but then, how to get it without showing my in-
tent ? But I never was at a loss in the scheming
line, so I pretended that a dog I had got was
troublesome, and took him to tie him to the wheel
of the dray ; this gave me an opportunity of get-
ting the axe and placing it unperceived under my
thick coat. By this time the old woman, who
seemed bewitched, would be content with nothing
short of going outside and looking for her son.
She went towards the spot and began moving the
houghs which covered the body. Now or never,
thought I. I prayed God to help me!!! deter-
mined to succeed or perish in the attempt, and
kept my eye upon Mulligan, who was close beside
me. He turned his head —one blow and down he
went, I then hastened towards the old woman ;
she was in the act of returning, having found her
son’s body; but playing the cunning, she said,
“ Lord ! what brings the police here ? There are
three of them getting over the fence.” I was not
to be gulled that way, so I gave her my foot, wbiob
staggered her, and then brought her down. Non#
now remained but the little girl ; the poor little
thing that had never done me an injury, and I was
really sorry for her. I went into the hut where
she remained, and I said to her, “ Now, my little
girl, I will do for you what I would not do for the
others, for you’re a good girl ; you shall have ten
minutes to say your prayers.” ’
“ Here,” says the magistrate, “ Lynch paused,
as if he had a difficulty in going on. I suppose it
might be a feeling of remorse, and I could easily
imagine that the scene of the [child begging for
life must hare bsen a most pitiable one. I there-
fore ended the pause by saying— ‘ In short, you
killed her, and with the axe.’ He said, ‘ I did ; ’
upon which I bade him proceed. ‘ I now,’ h#
said, ‘ began to consult with myself as to the
best mode of disposing of the bodies. If I burled
them in a frequented neighbourhood like that, it
was likely that the graves might be discovered.
There were plenty of wombat-holes near at hand,
but it would be troublesome to carry off all the
bodies, and the native dogs might pull them partly
out. I felt an aversion to the thought of burning
the bodies of my fellow-creatures—it seemed such
inhumanity ; but then I considered that the poor
things could feel nothing, and that it was little
odds to them whether they were burned or buried.
I therefore put them upon a heap of logs close to
the house, where the Mulligans had been burning
off a piece for potatoes. When the fire was well
made up I was surprised to see how the bodies
burned. They flared up as if they were so many
bags filled with fat. It was an awful thing to
stand alone in the dead of night and to see the
four bodies burning to ashes. By morning there
was nothing left but a heap, like of slacked lime ;
I took it up in my hand, and buried it in another
part of the paddock. I may have left, perhaps,
some ends of bone behind. I then burned the
greater part of the Mulligans’ clothes, and made
such alterations in the house as I judged neces-
sary—for I had still a difficult card to play, and
must satisfy the neighbourhood that I had be-
come rightfully possessed of the farm, horses,
and cattle.
“ ‘ The first thing I did was to go to Gray’s inn
and ask to see him. On his coming out I inquired
of him, with seeming concern, what kind of a
man Mulligan was in his dealings. I knew his
answer would b* an inquiry why I asked. I said
that I had just come from Sydney, where I had
met Mulligan and concluded a bargain with him,
but that he had failed to deliver the cattle as he
had promised. Knowing by Mulligan’s papers
the persons to whom he probably owed money, I
took care to go to them and make similar in-
quiries. Some of them seemed to look down upon
me as a kind of flat, and that Mulligan had taken
me in. I acknowledged that I had lent him a
valuable mare, which had cost me eighty guineas,
and pretended to look very blank when it was
hinted that perhaps I might never see my mare
again. Some thought that the whole thing was
made up between Mulligan and his landlord,
“ Smith,” for some fraudulent purpose of their
own.
“ ‘ I then went to Sydney, called at the Gazkttk
office, and, pretending to be Mulligan, paid for an
advertisement in his name, to the effect that,
his wife having absconded from her home, he
would not be answerable for her debts. I then
wrote several letters in his name to persons in Ihe
neighbourhood of his farm, being chiefly about
money matters, for I had collected enough of his
affairs to he able to word them in a suitable man-
ner, When I returned to Wombat Brush all these
things were told me as so much news, and I ap-
peared to he a victim. I afterwards wrote a let-
ter to myself, in Mulligan’s name, as from Ilia-
warra, and employed a man to put it for me in the
Campbelltown Pest-offioe, and this I shewed about.
The stupid fellow, however, not knowing nay
meaning, put it in ihe Liverpool instead, and thus
the postmark,’ he added, smiling, ‘enabled you,
sir, to detect the trick after I was apprehended.
But it answered well with the neighbours. A man
on the next farm, who at first troubled me with a
great many awkward questions, was at length so
satisfied that all was right, that he wanted me te
marry his daughter.
“ ‘ I have mentioned these things all at ohce to
account for my being allowed to enter, without
dispute, into the possession of the Mulligans’ pro-
perty. I succeeded in throwing dust into every-
body’s eyes. Even the officer of the Mounted
Police, and his three troopers, who called at the
hut a few days after the murder, went away quite
satisfied. But before I toek all these steps I went
down to Appin, with a light eart and two of
Bawtree’s horses, to fetch up Barnett and his
wife, who had been fellew-servants with me at
M’Evoy’s there. I had promised, when I parted
with them, if I raet a situation they would like I
would let them know. I accordingly described to
them the Mulligan family, and hired them in
Mulligan’s name. I left them the cart and one
horse to bring them up. I selected them because
they were immigrants, and simple peeple. They
would believe anything you told them. I had
thereto e no difficulty in accounting for the ab-
sence of the Mulligan family. I told them that
Mulligan and his wife had had a row, and that he
had turned her out, and that he had been obliged
to go to the Five Islands and hide, on account of
a horse found in his possession which was all
wrong (that is, stolen).
“ ‘ I was now comfortably settled, made im-
provements on the farm, determined to clear and
fence an additional paddock, and intended to lire
honestly, and do everything fair and square ; but
I was obliged to go down the ootmtry and settle
things with Smith, then the landlord. He was a
knowing shaver ; but I was as knowing as he, so
we arranged matters to the satisfaction of us
both.
“ * Returning home on one occasion from Syd-
ney, on the 18th of February last, I encamped on
the north side of Raeor-baok. In the morning,
while on the point of starting, Z was met and ac-
costed by a strange man who seemed to be very
free and open i u his conversation, and said that
he wanted to get out of the way, and that it
might not be known Where he was going.
“ Why t " I said ; “you do not look like a bush-
ranger.” “ No," said he, “ I’m an emigrant from
Ireland, and have just quarrelled with my wife,
and have a worn never to live with her again.” I
wanted a man to help to put up some fencing.
Now this was a pretty (£.e. strong-built) man, and
had the look of a good man for working, and, be-
ing simple enough to all appearance, seemed just
the fellow to suit me. I spoke him fair ; and after
some more talk, I hired him for six months for
£l3. This was Kerns Landregan, the man on
whose account lam about to suffer. At the time
I speak of I had not the most distant intention of
doing him an injury. We proceeded together to-
wards Berrima. I gathered more from him on
the way ; he said that he and his wife had earned
together as much as £8 per week, up the country,
during the lost harvest. On xnj saying it was a
large sum, he said that he could work against any
man, and his wife was accustomed to work too.
£he used to bind the sheaves for him ; on his part-
ing with her he had stuck to the money (that is,
kept it himself). I said, “Is she your lawful
wife?” He replied, “Yes.” “Andean you,”
said I, “defraud your own lawful wife of the
money she has hardly earned by the sweat of her
brow ? I would myself take a musket and rob
upon the highway, sooner than be guilty of such
cruelty. ’ I tried to persuade him to give her
some of his money, but he was obstinate. When
we passed Holland’s, where his wife was staying,
I saw her, while he hid himself under some clothes
in my cart. I then again tried to persuade him
to give his wife her own proper share, since he
had parted from her, as he declared, for ever.
But he had no feeling for her, and my heart be-
gan to turn against him, and to feel a hatred for
him as a selfish and hard-hearted man. When
we got to Crisp’s, he hid himself again ; and on
my asking all about it, as we got on the rood, he
gave me an account of having accused Mr. Crisp,
before the magistrates, of stealing a bundle that
he had left at the house. From his account I
perceived he was a kind of lawyer, and fond of
court. Besides, on getting better acquainted
with him, I found he was by no means simple, as
I at first supposed ; but had a deal of cunning
about him. I was sorry that I had hired him,
and would have got rid of him at once ; but, as
ill-luck would have it, having nothing about me
but orders, which I could not get cashed at Stone-
quarry, I had borrowed a one-pound'note of him.
I tried everywhere in vain to change my orders
during the day, but could not; I was even obliged
to borrow another one-pound note from him.
Towards sundown, two men with bundles joined
us on this side of Nattai Bridge, and expressed
their intention of camping with us for the night.
But this did not suit me, so that I spoke roughly
to them, on which they were offended and went
on- We encamped (Landregan and I) on the spot
well known to you, sir, and then I began to think
what I should do ; I was greatly agitated, and
could not close my eyes, while the other fellow
slept like a pig. What was I to do ? If I took
this fellow with his law to the farm with me, it
would certainly be my ruin ; for, after using his
wife as he had done, he would not stop at inform-
iug against me. Even if I got money in Berrima
(which I could do), and paid him Ills two pounds,
telling him at the same time bo be off, he would
have me up to Court for a breach of agreement,
and then the magistrate might ask questions. Wo
had been seen together by so many people on the
road, that there would be great risk in killing
him ; but, everything considered, it seemed the
safest and best plan after all. He deserved it for
hie ill-usage of his wife, and he had some money
in his pocket, although it was not for his money
I killed him. I passed the night thinking over
these thoughts ; and on the next morning, after
putting to the horse, I set my eye upon him. He
was a powerful-made man, I—small, as you see I
am ; and he had boasted to me that since he
was fifteen or sixteen years old he had never met
the man that could throw him. Well ! my man,
thought I, I fancy I shall be able bo settle you,
notwlbhstanding your fine limbs. He had just
laid down the tomahawk with which he had been
cutting a little wood to make up the fire. I took
it up without his perceiving me. “ Now I must
mind what I’m about ; for if I do not hit fair, and
he tackles me, I shall be done.” He sat astride
on the long log on which our fire was, smoking
his pipe, thinking of nothing ; his head was a
little turned from me : I gave him one blow, and
he fell, and then another when he was down, but
the first settled him. I then hid the body under
some bushes, where it was found next day, strip-
ping off all the clothes to the shirt, and hiding
tnem. I intended to have returned as soon as I
conveniently could, and buried the body ; but my
time was come, and I can see the hand of God in
my detection—for I well remember taking off the
belt (the discovery of which in my house was the
strongest thing against me at the trial), and
throwing it Into a small hole of water ; bat after
perceiving the end of it above the water, anfi
fearing to leave it there, I pitched it Into the cart
and never thought of it sinee. This was Sunday:
I rsturned home,H and on the Tuesday I was ap-
prehended l)y your orders. You know, sir, how
by degrees everything then eawie out,’”
