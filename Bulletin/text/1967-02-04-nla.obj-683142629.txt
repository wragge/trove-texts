The Catholic Crisis
PICTURE BY ROBERT McFARLANE


When you get a sudden, mad urge to go nowhere in particular
... burn up the miles ... feel the whip of the wind. Is it love,
fate or a slight touch of the compulsive, highly contaaious
MGB? Is yours a restless, driving, nagging, aching,
longing to proceed immediately to your nearest
MCB showroom? Why fight it? Remember: M GB driv-
ers rarely travel alone. (You may have noticed it).
The Octagon Spirit
the irresistible force
of a highly movable

Message from Singapore
IT is not surprising that Dr.
Goh Keng Swee, Singapore’s
Defence Minister, gave one of the
most stimulating papers at last
week-end’s Summer School in
Canberra on Asian Communism,
organised by the Australian Insti-
tute of Political Science. Dr. Goh’s
Government is not only one of the
most socially progressive in Asia,
it has also had intimate experience
of the Communist threat to demo-
cracy in Asia. With brutal frank-
ness, Dr. Goh made the point that
the price his country has had to
pay for the preservation of pro-
gressive and liberal ideals is: an
efficient secret police!
This is one of the key passages
in his paper: “The first and most
important of the prerequisites to
success is, I regret to say, an effi-
cient secret police, or ‘Special
Branch’ to use the delicate British
colonial term for it. The object is
not so much to capture the secret
Communist underground for, with-
out very severe totalitarian controls,
this cannot be easily achieved. The
main function of the secret police
is the penetration of all Communist
united-front mass organisations.
Since the membership and overt
leadership of these organisations are
by their nature open and not secret,
penetration should not present diffi-
culty to technically competent
police personnel.. The object is to
identify the principal leaders, assess
their characters and capability, and
find out the current intentions and
plans of these organisations. With-
out such knowledge available to the
Government, counter - measures
against the Communists may well
prove counter-productive. With
such knowledge, we can, to quote
Mao, ‘await the enemy’s assault
with ease and poise’.”
Dr. Goh did not conceal the
function of the secret police in
detaining key united front leaders
at appropriate times. He stressed
frankly that, in emergencies, due
processes of law cannot be applied
because to reveal the evidence in
a court would expose agents who
have penetrated Communist organ-
isations and because participation
in Communist conspiracies is not
always illegal, at least not before
the stage of violence is reached.
What Dr. Goh had to say was
not always palatable and need not
apply to Australia, but the very
least that can be said for it is that
he clearly faced the problem of
preserving democracy when it is
threatened, as it has been all over
Asia, by internationally organised
gangsters. The other valuable
aspect of Dr. Goh’s paper was his
analysis of Communist techniques,
an analysis based on detailed know-
ledge of Communist operations in
Singapore and Malaya where
Peking, not poverty, is the crucial
factor.
Dr. Goh did not emphasise the
point made by Mr. Owen Harries
of the need for Australia to concen-
trate on maintaining the American
commitment in South-east Asia as
well as on developing our own
defences in case that commitment
collapses. But in his frank assess-
ment of the difficult and often un-
savoury domestic problems in-
volved in containing Communism
he had done Australia good ser-
vice. We have never faced a crisis
comparable to the ones Singapore
has faced and it is as well to know
how the democratic socialists of
Asia see the Communist threat to
their survival.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Why Big Tom Said “Yes”
From ALAN REID in Canberra
The decision of the Australian Workers’ Union to affiliate with the ACTU
has put the gigantic AWU back on the centre of the Australian industrial stage.
For some years now, the AWU has
been a declining force on the Australian
industrial scene. It has looked after
the interests of its 175,000 members
very well, but in the general trade
union arena it has been a recumbent
giant. Nobody could afford to kick it,
it possesses assets of $lO million and a
governing hierarchy that is both tough
and aggressive; but if you stepped
round it, it could be ignored.
Now it no longer can. When its
application for membership is formally
approved by the ACTU interstate
executive on February 27, it will be-
come the largest single component of
a very powerful trade union group-
ing that, under the presidency of Mr.
Albert Monk, deals with Government
on a basis of near equality.
It will have 80 delegates, with the
next largest delegation the 23 from the
Federated Clerks’ Union, and the 21
from the Federated Ironworkers’ As-
sociation, with which organisations it
will have ideological and industrial
links. (The AWU is the only union in
Australia with the rule that no Com-
munist can become an official; both
the Clerks and Ironworkers are strongly
anti-Communist, and all three unions
support the arbitration system and are
flatly opposed to political strikes.)
The decline of the AWU as a major
influence in trade union affairs was
due to circumstances rather than any
loss of forceful thrusting on the part of
its top officials. Big Tom Dougherty,
60, an ex-cane cutter, now a well-
tailored $B5OO a year executive (who
still reverts to shirtsleeves when work-
ing), is a physically tough six-footer
who has never hesitated to throw round
his still muscular, trim weight. Most of
the other top AWU officials are from
the same mould.
The present Prime Minister, Harold
Holt, was indirectly responsible
for some of the AWU’s decline. When
the Menzies Liberal-Country Party
coalition came to office in 1949, Holt
was appointed Labor Minister. Up to
that stage, the ACTU and the AWU
were regarded broadly as having
equal rights in representing the in-
dustrial movement.
But Holt decided to treat the ACTU
(and its president, Albert Monk, now
66, with whom he had personal
acquaintance and for whose ability and
sense of national responsibility he had
considerable admiration) as the official
mouthpiece of the Australian trade
union movement.
Increasingly the AWU got squeezed
out of things. It was Monk who negoti-
ated with the Government on the
unions’ behalf. It was Holt who was
consulted when the Government needed
an official reaction to a contemplated
move.
The AWU could endure this philoso-
phically for a while. It was losing ad-
vantage but sooner or later the wheel
would turn. Sooner or later Labor would
be back in office. And Labor gave it
equal representation with the ACTU.
But 17 years passed. The wheel did
not turn. Labor did not gain office.
The AWU turned into a critic as harsh
and in some ways more effective
than any of the opponents of the present
Left-wing controllers of the ALP.
OTHER things happened. The con-
trollers of the ACTU seemed to
have achieved ascendancy over the
Left-wing and Communist elements
within its ranks which at one stage had
looked as though they would control
the ACTU.
A movement started within the AWU
the Committee for Membership
Control to take the AWU away
from its present controllers. The CMC
did not* make much progress. But it
had one effective argument: it criti-
cised the AWU for not being affiliated
with the ACTU and argued tellingly
that this placed the AWU outside
the mainstream of Australian indus-
trial affairs.
The employers tightened their ranks,
and despite their nominal hostility to
the ACTU, the AWU found it advan-
tageous to contribute to the ACTU’s
industrial hearings. It did this with
alacrity when Mr. R. Hawke, a young
lawyer, became the ACTU’s industrial
advocate and showed that he could
hold his own with any barrister in
Australia on industrial matters.
So the AWU reversed its policy.
Whereas previously and particularly
when there was a danger of its passing
under Communist control—the ACTU
was a thing of abhorrence, it now be-
came the AWU’s stepping stone into
the modern era. The fact that the
ACTU also on occasions had trouble
with the Labor Party did not upset
the AWU. More and more the ACTU
of necessity rather than because
of political inclinations of those who
lead it was becoming non-political.
With Labor in the wilderness for 17
ALP: the Leadership Stakes
AS they line up at the barrier it
appears that Gough Whitlam
(N.S.W.) has taken up the in-
side position; next in line are Jim
Cairns (Vic.), Frank Crean (Vic.),
Fred Daly (N.S.W.), with Gordon
Bryant (Vic.), and the lone Western
Australian candidate, Kim Beazley,
on the outside. Although he was keen
to run it is understood the connec-
tions of Arthur Calwell persuaded
the old stayer to scratch.
The hot favorite is Whitlam, a
smart type with plenty of early speed
and the ability to take up a handy
position in a field. He is suspect be-
yond a middle-distance and some-
times races greenly under pressure.
However, he has been specially
trained for this race and whoever
beats him should win.
There is no questioning the chance
of one of his chief opponents, Jim
Cairns, on the score of fitness. He
has been under arduous training for
some time and is thriving on the pre-
paration. He has a band of dedicated
followers who will not hear of him
being defeated, but keen observers
claim that his coming from the Vic-
torian stable, which is famous for
its unorthodox methods of training,
could be against him in an event of
this kind. His strength in a finish is
proverbial.
Frank Crean is a stablemate of
Cairns. He is generally regarded as
a one-pace, rather plodding type,
but if the more fancied runners cut
at one another in the early stages
he could get the sit on them and be
in the finish. He is easy to ride in
a field.
One of the more unpredictable
runners is Fred Daly who has proved
hard to train in the past. Most
of the educated New South Wales
money will be on Whitlam and it is
likely that Whitlam supporters will
look for an interstate candidate, per-
haps from Tasmania, when choosing
a second chance for the quinella.
However, Daly could fill second
place if the terms of the race are
dictated by Cairns or Crean.
Too little is known of gallant
Westralian, Kim Beazley, in the
eastern States. He has registered a
few brilliant performances on trips
to Canberra, but lacks supporters
in the two big cities. Watch the
market.
Gordon Bryant is a late entry and
his connections are not over-confi-
dent about winning, but have hopes
of filling second place.
B.B.


years, likely to stay there for some
time, the ACTU could not sacrifice the
interests of its membership to senti-
mental support for a Labor Party that
seemed to have degenerated into a per-
manent Opposition. It earned the dis-
pleasure of Opposition Leader Arthur
Calwell when it stayed aloof from
the Vietnam issue and Australian mili-
tary participation in the Vietnam
struggle the issue on which the last
Federal elections were fought.
Now the AWU has moved into an
arena in which the course of events is
decided, not debated. It has become the
largest, single unit in the ACTU com-
plex. In that role it is inevitable that
the AWU must have a larger influence
upon trade union developments and
affairs than it has had for some years.
It has moved from isolationism into the
mainstream of Australian industrial
affairs, and its giant, non-Communist
influence is bound to be a factor (as
the Communists are well aware) in the
industrial events ahead.
Tanner
"So our parents are responsible for overcrowded schools!"
Adelaide without Walsh
Although Master Tun Shan had been' dead for some time his disciples con-
tinued to weep bitterly without interruption. Suddenly he opened his eyes and
said: “Those who leave home should be mindless of illusory externals. What is the
point of being anxious for life or death?’ 3 He then postponed his death for seven
days.
An admirable example which the
Premier of South Australia, Mr. Frank
Walsh, would gladly follow were it
not for a local ALP rule that compels
Labor politicians to line up for their
wreaths at 70.
He goes because he must, not because
he wants to or because he feels he has
had enough.. He has revelled in the
job, he keeps his health and he has had
only two years in office. He is not even
permitted to complete a single three-
year term. He has agreed to go soon
enough to give his successor the best
part of a year to settle in before the
next elections, which are due in the
March after this one.
It was the sort of agreement that
Charles I made with his executioner,
that the thing be done neatly. There
was a move to have the rule, waived,
but it fizzled out. As Mr. Walsh is a
stickler for rules himself, his own heart
may not have been in it.
His hope is that he can decently stay
until the financing of the natural gas
pipeline from Gidgealpa to Adelaide
is certain. The pipeline would make a
superb memorial for him, but that is
not what he will be remembered for.
His niche is that of a Labor leader who
brought the Party back to a Promised
Land which in 30 years had all but for-
gotten what a Labor Government
looked like. Considering the gerryman-
dered grip the Liberals had on the
State that was a Mosaic achievement.
But Frank Walsh is not the stuff of
which prophets are made. He is an
easygoing, likable man who plays it
quietly except when he smells humbug
or disloyalty. He makes the centre of a
circle rather than the leader of a
column, a composer of differences rather
than an original. Not that he lacks
ideas, only the ability to express them.
There are three open contenders for
his position so far: Mr. Cyril Hutchens,
the Deputy Leader; Mr. Don Dunstan,
the Attorney-General, and Mr. Gabriel
Bywaters, the Minister for Agriculture.
As the highly regarded Minister of
Education, Mr. Loveday, is interested
only in education, that completes the
list except for one deep thinker, Mr.
J. D. (Des) Corcoran, the Minister of
Lands, who has not yet committed
himself.
Corcoran is the youngest of the four
only 38, the same age as Ray Hall,
whom the Liberals chose last year ta


succeed Sir Thomas Playford. He came
straight from a commission in the
Regular Army (Japan, Korea, and
Malaya, with two mentions in dis-
patches) to take his father’s old seat
in the South-East. He promises to be
as popular as his father was and for
the same reason. He is friendly, direct
(“straight as a die”), and competent.
When the Premier went on television
to announce his retirement he men-
tioned Hutchens, Dunstan, and By-
waters as all good men and worthy
successors. “And then,” he added, as
if it were more than an afterthought,
“there’s Des Corcoran.” The old man
obviously has a warm spot for him and
that may be where his own vote will
come from in the ballot.
Corcoran, like Walsh, is Catholic,
the only one of the four who is. One
mentions it as a fact of interest rather
than of weight. The Party has to make
a clear-headed choice since its future
so obviously depends on choosing right.
The one thing that matters is under
which of the four has it the best chance
of survival as a Government.
The choice can be put another way.
Is it better to play for smiles as a
bland, middle-of-the-road Labor Party,
or does the hope rest on taking a
plunge with Dunstan and defiance?
Another possibility would be a Dun-
stan willing to drop his arrogance
the hope of being able to show in the
next twelve months that he has, in
fact, dropped it.
'J'HIS other Dunstan is by no means
inconceivable. When he wants to, he
can charm the birds out of the trees,
especially on television. He has looks,
grace, intelligence, wit, and youth. (He
is actually 40, but not even Corcoran
manages to look younger.) He is not
only the most articulate member of
the Government; most of its ideas are
plainly his.
There is a freshness about the
Attorney-General that no one else in
the party can match. He is a genuine
Fabian reformer. But it is easier to
admire him than to like him. There
is often a rude intolerance to him that
his colleagues must find insufferable.
His habitual reply in the House to any
criticism is “Nonsense.”
A year in the Premiership might
make a world of difference to him and
Labor’s prospects for what at present
look ominously like the Ides of March.
Of the alternatives to Dunstan, Cyril
Hutchens is 63, a senatorial figure,
bland and sometimes pompous. It is
hard to see him making any sort of
impression on the State other than that
the party was playing it safe.
Gabriel Bywaters would make a good
compromise qhoice. At 52 he is tre-
mendously hardworking and is making
a clear success of his handling of
Agriculture.
He has some of the Playford quali-
ties, including the non-comformist ones.
There is, however, one difference. Play-
ford, though he neither drinks nor
smokes, doesn’t mind that others do.
He can be the life and soul of a party
in which he is the only person drink-
ing lemonade. Bywaters is made bf
sterner stuff. His disapproval shows.
But that would probably not tell'-'
against him in what is still the most
rock-bottom non-rconformist territory in
the Commonwealth. .
The real trouble with By waters is
that, like Hutchens, he strikes no
sparks and hoists no flag. Dunstan does.
could. This is where the
may lie. Corcoran is a great
f 'Admirer of the Attorney-General and
part of his reluctance to declare his
intentions may come from a sense of
loyalty to Dunstan. But no doubt it is
being put to him in quiet places that
his first loyalty is to the Party.
JOHN EDGCOMBE
They’re All Right Jack
The Radical Right rides again. After a break of three months, the “Australian
International News Review” is back in circulation.
Nominally a fortnightly, the magazine
began to miss a few publishing dates
about August last year and stopped pub-
lication for 1966 in October. It was
clear that the “News Review”, despite
its glossy cover and a layout imitative
of “Newsweek,” must have been a heavy
financial drain on its backers. Its adver-
tising load was far too light and
although a circulation of over 20,000
was claimed there are reasons to won-
der whether most of these sales were
genuine. Some sellers remember regu-
lar buyers who were always quick to
purchase a dozen or so as soon as the
magazine hit the street.
The chief financial backers of the
“News Review” are reported to be a
Sydney businessman and a New South
Wales grazier. It may be no coinci-
dence that the breaking of the drought
has been followed by the re-emergence
of the magazine with the January 11
and January 25 issues. As they say in
the Channel country, it never rains
but it pours.
Some of the themes of the first issue
for 1967 may be reported. The first
letter for the year concerns fluoridation,
that monster from which Eric Butler
and the League of Rights are striving
to protect an innocent nation. The
letter describes fluoridation as a
“menace.” A second letter is also anti-
fluoridation. From the usual unremark-
able anti-Communist letters there is also
correspondence on another of the
“News Review” favorites, Social
Credit.
The major article in the first issue
of the re-emergent “News Review” is on
Mr. Edward St. John and his winning
of the Liberal pre-selection for the
Federal seat of Warringah.
“News Review” and its Radical
Right correspondent and reporters have
an extraordinary and irrational animus
against St. John who is supposed to be
some sort of Left Wing infiltrator of
the Liberal Party. Mr. St. John is des-
cribed as “bitter-tongued,” and “thin-
lipped.” He is by inference linked with
opponents of the Allied cause in Viet-
nam.
“Mr. St. John will now sit in the
Australian Parliament as the official
representative of Warringah. He will
open fetes and bazaars, address meet-
ings, and no doubt use his undoubted
gift for fast talking to stir his fellow
members in the House of Reprsentatives.
Will he continue to sow seeds of distrust
and hatred against South Africa and
Rhodesia, loyal allies in the world
struggle against Communists?”
The attempt to link St. John with
Communism is wildly misleading.
The reasons for the attack on St. John
are that the “News Review” group and
the League of Rights are disturbed by
St. John’s opposition to apartheid and
the Smith regime in Rhodesia, and they
have chosen the seat of Warringah as
the base from which to operate in their
campaign to gain more influence in
the New South Wales Liberal Party.
That St. John clearly lost votes
in the election as a result of the Radical
Right campaign against him, will they
hope, be a caution to other Liberals
opposed to the policies of the South
African and Rhodesian Governments.
“News Review,” it is clear, i£ not just
a journalistic phenomenon but part of
an operation by such groups as the
League of Rights, obsessive anti-Com-
munists, anti-Semites, race-mongers,
and their myrmidons to infiltrate con-
servative politics.
The January 25 issue of the “News
Review” picks up the threads of anti-
Semitism again. The first letter is from
an " overwrought Jew who says he
doubts “whether there is another race
on this planet whose members could
be so vicious toward their fellow men
as Jews can” and similar gross charges.
A three-page article in the same issue,
accompanied by horrific pictures of
mutilations and amputations, attacks
the Jewish claim to Israel, Zionism,
and pro-Semitism. The article, by Ethel
Mannin, is not without some merit, but
he would be a simple man who thought
the “News Review” printed it out of
love for the Arabs.
The typical “News Review” corres-
pondent believes that there are a num-
ber of concentric conspirators in the
world working to take over free, white,
and Christian nations for fluoridation,
Jewish profit, Communist ideology,
and Black Power.
Just how the Jews and the Negroes
are linked up is a closely kept secret,
and why Semitic Communists want a
world of “fluoride-white teeth” in
ebony faces cannot yet be revealed.
However the “News Review” is tem-
porarily back in business and may
yet have time to reveal all before lack
of advertising or a drought causes
another suspension of circulation.

New State?
Before the referendum on the pro-
posed seventh State, New England, is
even under way, there has been an
application for an injunction to pre-
vent the referendum.
Briefly, the possible new State was
defined in 1934 by a Royal Commis-
sion, Mr. Nicholas, K.C. His sugges-
tions were left in a pigeon hole by the
N.S.W. Government until 1966, when
a New England referendum became an
election promise, later honored by an
enabling Act,
This New State Referendum Act is
now being challenged, although the
vote would be merely a “yes” or “no”
indication by New England’s 420,000
electors and would have to be fol-
lowed, if carried, by another referen-
dum of all N.S.W. electors.
Even in this final stage Constitutional
as well as financial problems could
occur. In their time the fathers of our
1900 Constitution made “leaving home”
as difficult for States as for children.
New England’s latest bid to break
free has a built-in complication in
its suggested boundaries, not very dif-
ferent from the Nicholas Commission’s
triangle running north from Newcastle
to the Queensland border, west some
400 miles and south-east back to New-
castle and there’s the rub.
W H . Y > ask critics of the New Eng-
land scheme, if the driving force
behind the new State movement is sup-
posed to be decentralisation, should
they include a ready-made industrial
complex likely to strangle outward,
provincial industrial development?
New England is rural, say the diehards,
so let it stay that way, or at least de-
velop its own industries naturally, as
the Riverina would have to do if it
also became a separate State as sug-
gested in the Nicholas report.
Newcastle has its own reservations,
including Hunter Valley farmers’ ques-
tions about the Sydney milk market
should it become interstate, and sec-
ondary industry’s unanswerable queries
on various possible taxes in a new
State.
Cynics claim that N.S.W. has made
a gesture which it knows to be mean-
ingless; that even the first referendum
must be lost, and the Movement set
back another 50 years. Against this,
enthusiasts of the New England New
State Movement, due to meet in Tam-
worth on February 10 (the day the
injunction to restrain will be heard),
plan to spend up to $lOO,OOO on a
sudden-death “yes” campaign before
the referendum date, April 29.
Meanwhile, the N.S.W. Government
has asked a panel of four University
men to prepare two-sided arguments.
These are necessary. Early last
month a Sydney “Sunday Telegraph”
reporter made spot checks through the
proposed new State area and found
too many people, from Newcastle to
Brewarrina to the Gold Coast, who
asked, “What referendum for what new
State, mate?”


Colombo Plan Disasters
By K. G. TREGONNING
(Raffles Professor of History, University of Singapore)
PAYA LEBAR airport at Singapore
is crowded at this time of the
year with Asian students return-
ing to Australia. Qantas and other
lines organise special flights, and all
are packed. Parents and relatives crowd
the departure halls here and at other
airports throughout South-East Asia.
There are now 7000 students from Asia
in Australia, and in all the talk of
Australia’s ever increasing one-way com-
mitment with Asia, this is one element
that is referred to invariably with pride.
These students fall into two clear
categories: Colombo Plan scholarship
holders and private students. The first
are usually the best of the schools, the
second are the sons of the wealthy or
those unable to secure entry to their
local university. Both categories, how-
ever, so it is generally assumed, benefit
from an Australian education, and re-
turn to their Asian country to spread
out that benefit. To the extent that
Australia contributes, particularly by its
Colombo Plan commitment, it is
thought that this is a good investment,
and that, indeed, it could not do better.
I feel this is incorrect. Australians
are wrong when they think that educa-
tion in Australia is the best preparation
for life in South-East Asia. Australia
could give far better help by rechannel-
ling its aid. Australian funds, to my
mind, could be far more usefully em-
ployed as. an investment assisting Asians
to receive a better education in their
own country.
AUSTRALIA weakens Asian nation
building, not strengthens it. It takes
away from the challenges and problems
of their own country both the com-
mitted and uncommitted. It gives them
an education in many cases irrelevant
to, and at times opposed to, conditions
in their own environment.
Many Asians, as my own experience
has shown me, return completely
estranged from their own land. The
“Westernised Oriental Gentleman,” or
WOG, was a fit subject for pity and
derision in the colonial era. Then,
however, the government and future of
his country did not involve him, and
this weakness could be accommodated.
Today, there is no colonial cushion,
merely colonial attitudes among the
more conservative. Weak though he is,
nations have had to rely on many of
them* Should they? Is not this one
reason why Burma is so weak and why
India falters? And if the brightest of the
schoolboys returns to his country un-
prepared, and very ill equipped, to
grapple with the political, economic,
and social problems of his own environ-
ment, can ifbe claimed that Australia
has given him an education?
Has the deculturised Malaysian
Chinese who returns to Kuala Lumpur
from Australia unable to speak the
national tongue, unable even to read
his own script, really been educated for
his nation and its Asian environment?
It is a national tragedy when so many
bright and clever men, and others as
well, receive an “education” that,
praiseworthy in many ways, is of no
relevance for South-East Asia.
A trivial personal experience gives an
illustration. Plagued by a painful ear-
ache, I could find no satisfactory treat-
ment from my doctor, a Chinese gradu-
ate of an Australian university. In
great pain, my case finally was success-
fully diagnosed by another, a graduate
Sir John Crawford Send him to
Singapore.
of the Medical School here. He recog-
nised the symptom of a tropical ear
infection, unknown in temperate Mel-
bourne yet not uncommon here. I
could not hhlp wishing the first doctor
knew more about the diseases of his
country.
Australia long ago decided that it
would commit no funds for assisting
education in Asia unless such funds
were spent in Australia. That is why
there are scholarships in Australia, but
not in Asia. That is why we have a use-
less collection of Australian history
books in our University of Singapore
library, because these books and some
of a little more relevance to Asia could
be bought in Australia. The fact that
our library is hopelessly inadequate is
only our concern. No help to build a
bigger one can be expected from Aus-
tralia. Yet how much more use funds
for this purpose would be if not for
our library, then for our medical centre
or the local technical colleges.
Educational aid should be used in
Asia itself. In Indonesia, or Vietnam,
or Malaysia, it could be of immense
benefit. Perhaps it can be said that
buildings should be the concern of the
government involved. This is a doctrin-
aire attitude which seems rather tough
on underdeveloped countries short of
funds, but nevertheless seems to be ac-
cepted by Australia in the Colombo
Plan, although not in SEATO.
Another particular method, however,
whereby aid is effectively used in Asia
itself is the task force used by Canada.
A host university appointed by the
Canadian Government organises a five
or ten year project. It collects staff in
Canada for a missing department and
flies them to the scene of action. They
begin to teach, quickly adapting them-
selves and their teaching to the local
environment. At the same time they
begin to recruit local men, and send
them to Canada for postgraduate train-
ing. Gradually the Canadians are
phased out. Finally a locally staffed
department is operating, men with ex-
perience both of their own environ-
ment and overseas. Scores, perhaps
hundreds, of local graduates are con-
tributing to the development of their
State in their State.
QNE of the weaknesses of Singapore
merely to suggest an example
is in statistics. I heard Sir John
Crawford, Vice-Chancellor of the Aus-
tralian National University, compare
the statistical organisation of Singapore
to that of Australia in 1929. We lack
a Department of Statistics, and if
tackled in the by-now stereotyped Aus-
tralian way, presumably a scholarship
in Australia where conditions are
now very different might be possible
for a boy leaving school. How much
more effective if the Canadian task-
force method were adopted. And, since
the bone has been pointed, what better
man than Sir John to organise it.
Another method could be modelled
on the surgical project under way here.
On funds made available, so I under-
stand, by the Singapore Turf Club,
regular visits of a team of eminent
surgeons from Sydney are arranged. For
a week or so, one or other of the team
demonstrates in Singapore’s General
Hospital one particular surgical tech-
nique. Again and again, in a local
environment, Singapore surgeons and
students watch an expert operate, going
over and over one particular operation.
Thus a skill is passed on in the environ-
ment where it will be most useful.
Irrespective of the increasing diffi-
culty of finding places for Asians in
Australian universities, it does seem
to me that it is basically far more
healthy for all concerned for education
to be organised and developed in the
region involved. Education outside it is
at best only half an education. It leads
in many cases to an estrangement, even
possibly an emasculation, of those in-
volved. Few, if any, long-term benefits
accrue and many problems are created.

OVERSEAS
They Came, Saw, and Went
Wilson is welcomed to Europe by Italy’s Premier Moro
Wait and see. Most French commentators had at least to borrow an English
expression to define both their Government’s attitude and the prospects for the
British hid at the close of Mr. Wilson’s talks in Paris. He came, he pleaded, but
did he convince?
The British Prime Minister, Harold
Wilson, in his final Paris Press con-
ference on the Wednesday, insisted that
he had not come to get “yes” or “no”
as an answer. M. Couve de Murville,
on television later that evening,
emphasised that the talks had been
purely exploratory and there was no
question of any conclusion. Mr. Wilson
was non-committal about General de
Gaulle’s response.
At least, if this second attempt meets
the fate of its predecessor, nobody will
be able to attribute it to a “misunder-
standing.” Mr. Wilson, Mr. Brown,
and their team spent a great deal of
time with an impressive French team,
headed at two states by the General
and the rest of the time by M. Pom-
pidou. On Tuesday morning Mr. Wil-
son elaborated to the General the
points he had made in Strasbourg.
During the lunch both he and Mr.
Brown had an opportunity for more
informal exchanges with the General.
The toasts conformed to the usual
pattern of cordiality. But the bulk of
the afternoon was taken up by the
more arduous problem of sterling.
Little time was spent on the position
and prospects of Britain’s balance, of
payments, which the British side
summed up in very optimistic tones.
It was the role of sterling, and parti-
cularly the potential burden for the
European Community of sterling
balances, that figured prominently in
the debate. Mr. Wilson had prepared
a detailed lecture to prove that sterling
would not be a liability. But the
French, headed by M. Pompidou, were
also briefed thoroughly. Figures were
quoted by both sides, and the inter-
pretations did not always agree. The
discussion went on for so long that the
other big item on the agenda, agri-
culture, had to be put off till Wednes-
day afternoon, just before the final
meeting with General de Gaulle,
What was said about farming may
be guessed from the denial of Mr.
Brown, during the Press conference,
tbat Britain had officially agreed to
accept not only the Rome. Treaty but
also all the subsequent decisions of the
Slx - He claimed that agriculture need
not be , an insurmountable obstacle. He
nevertheless argued that under piesent
regulations Britain would have to con-
tnbute to the common fund roughly as
much as the Six put in togethei. Was

revision of this aspect of the common

after a |, the very points on which
General de Gaulle, according to French
sources, had based his conviction that
Britain remains subservient to the
United States. If he has not quizzed
Mr. Wilson on these issues, how can
he be convinced of the Prime
Minister’s “conversion”? Obviously, the
General may be waiting to raise these
issues at a later stage. On second
thoughts, perhaps there is still. scope
for a “misunderstanding.”
It was in economic matters that
Mr. Wilson could assert his desire for
European independence. The techno-
logical community, Western Europe’s
need for advanced British know-how,
was his trump card. He played it skil-
fully, both in Strasbourg and Paris.
Since some Gaullists had started talking
about British “association” combined
with technological deals, he killed this
idea in the bud. He proclaimed t'hat
Britain wants to play its full economic
and political part within the Com-
munity and does not even contemplate
association. Then, in his Paris Press
conference, having described co-opera-
tion in aircraft, he hinted quite plainly
that further collaboration in such
civilian fields as electronics would
“depend” on Britain joining the Com-
munity. The threat was hardly veiled.
But the final judgment of Paris is still
to come. Much will now depend on
Mr. Wilson’s tactics. Before leaving the
French capital he said that he did not
think he would have to return before
making up his mind. Did he mean that
at the end of his European tour he
would decide whether to make an
official application, asking the Six to
give him a collective answer? French
officials, taking into account Britain’s
financial difficulties, do not think in
terms of months but of years and years.
Only if Mr. Wilson tries to hustle will
it be possible to see whether General
de Gaulle has changed his mind, which
is doubtful. In the meantime, relations
can be “cordial.” France can afford 10
wait and see.

NEW YORK LETTER
The Death
WHOEVER changed the name of
the venerable book - publishing
house of Harper Brothers to
Harper and Row some years ago
i must have had a rare gift of foresight.
Seldom, if ever, in publishing history
has a row of such proportions and
potentialities been engendered as the
storm presently swirling about the old
firm’s publication of “The Death of a
President.”
Actually, the book has not even ap-
peared between hard covers and is not
scheduled to go on sale until March.
What triggered the wretched uproar,
which has diminished the stature of vir-
tually everyone involved, notably the
Kennedy clan and author William Man-
chester, was the serialisation of the
manuscript now under way in “Look”
magazine.
The ironic aspect of the bitterness
stirred up by the Manchester book is
that it was commissioned by the Ken-
nedys as the “official” history of the
assassination. Mrs. Kennedy poured out
her recollections of the assassination in
ten hours of tape-recorded interviews.
Manchester contends that the changes
she insisted on making in the final
form of the manuscript, and to which
he acceded, were largely of a political
nature. In a remarkably frank interview
this week giving his side of the contro-
versy to “Newsweek” magazine and to
the New York “Times,” author Man-
chester stated that “The first six (of
Mrs. Kennedy’s) changes that I en-
countered in the galley proofs involved
LBJ and had nothing to do with her or
her children.”
JHE book’s first references to the
Texan who now sits in the White
House portray him as a crude outdoor
type who insisted that the sensitive
Boston aristocrat John Kennedy ac-
company him on a deer hunt on the
LBJ ranch shortly after the 1960 Presi-
dential elections. Johnson saw to it
that President Kennedy actually shot
and killed one of the animals. “The
memory of the creature’s death had
been haunting,” according to “Look’s”
text, “and afterward he (Kennedy) had
relived it with his wife, trying to heal
the inner scar.” Other references to
President Johnson in forthcoming chap-
ters are said to present him in more
unfavorable lights.
However, references to President
Johnson might well reflect the bias of
author Manchester as much as the
well-advertised antipathy of the Ken-
nedy family. In his interview with the
New York “Times,” Manchester dis-
closed the contents of a letter he
had written to Mrs. Kennedy. “Though
I tried desperately to suppress my bias
against a certain eminent statesman
who always reminded me of some-
one in a Grade D movie of the late
show,” Manchester wrote, “the bias
showed through. This was cheap of


me, but I suppose there is a little
meanness in all of us.”
The position of the Senator and the
widow now is that although they auth-
orised the author to write the book and
actively assisted in its preparation, they
did not approve the text, and there-
fore assume no responsibility for any
anti-Johnson feeling reflected in its
pages. It is questionable, however, that
this disclaimer is being swallowed by the
American public, much less by the
individual most concerned. His silence
is undoubtedly a factor in the recent
wave of sympathy that has been devel-
oping in the country for the President,
in the light of the Kennedys’ behaviour
toward the author and their undis-
guised attempts to enforce their point
of view on all who write of the events
in Dallas. If Manchester can be be-
lieved, the Kennedys showed him
“what it was like to live in an absolute
monarchy” during his “three years of
agony” in preparing the manuscript.
In his interview with the New York
“Times,” Manchester likened Jackie
Kennedy to “Marie Antoinette com-
pletely isolated from the world around
her by her court, her advisers. She
must be seen to be believed. When
she turns on the charm, it’s incredible.”
jYJANCHESTER disclosed that at the
beginning he transferred his feel-
ing of admiration for the late President
to his brother and widow but this had
been a mistake. “They don’t understand
contemporary history,” he contended.
“John Kennedy did.”
In return for the emotional travail,
as well as three years of work on the
book, Manchester estimated that he
would “come out with about 500,000
dollars.” A Kennedy family spokesman
has estimated Manchester’s eventual
earnings as much more than that —■
in the neighborhood of two and three-
quarter million dollars, including
“Look” serialisation, book publication,
and foreign rights.
Mrs. Kennedy’s belated realisation of
Manchester’s financial gain from the
book apparently was a factor in her
suit to enjoin its publication. She had
been under the mistaken impression
that the author would receive only
modest remuneration for his work and
that most of the proceeds would go to
the Kennedy Memorial Library.
That this entire attempt at Kennedy-
authorised history has tarnished the
public image of the Senator and the
beautiful widow seems clear. For the
first time since the assassination articles
critical of Jackie Kennedy are appear-
ing in the American Press. “The public
appears to be willing to dissociate
the legend of President Kennedy from
the present-day adventures and political
manoeuvres of his widow, Jacqueline,
and his brother Robert,” writes Wash-
ington columnist Marianne Means.
“And many of those who have believed
in a unique Kennedy destiny no longer
accept as inevitable that Robert Ken-
nedy will one day sit in the White
House.”

Who Was Kirmess?
Sir,
I would be grateful if any of your
readers could help me solve a mystery.
In 1908-9 THE BULLETIN’S stable-
mate, The Lone Hand, published in
instalments an extraordinary novel
entitled “The Commonwealth Crisis,”
by Charles H. Kirmess.
In April, 1909, it was published by
George Robertson and Co. as “The
Australian Crisis.” The story concerns
a hypothetical invasion of Australia in
1912 by the Japanese, and it is easily
the most distinguished in the whole
series of Australian invasion novels.
The mystery is: who was Kirmess?
Any light anyone can throw on his
identity w ill be most welcome.

“Imaginative Obscenity ”
Sir,
Where do the artists as a voluble
force exist in our community? Do I
detect a nebulous fog of hoohah devel-
oping around the Brown case or is
it just that those concerned do not know
what to do?
I think that the only solution for
artists who wish to lend more than
sympathy to Mr. Brown’s cause -- the
liberalising of artistic imagery and
vocabulary—is for them to paint imag-
inative obscenity or pornography them-
selves, and to exhibit it in public.
Even if the man in the street, or
innocent children and their parents, is
presumably depraved and appalled, the
catharsis would do us some good.
Now, for the gallery proprietor! He
could weigh his chances (is the artist
really worth it?), risking a fine and
then, if necessary, plead guilty.
A happier turn of events would be
for the Contemporary Art Society to
stage a “Pornographic Exhibition.” This
would be open to all members. The
famous CAS standard would apply.
All works would be “creative and
original.”

Sir,
Not being clairvoyant, I was unable
to predict the outcome of the Michael

to the CAS, with March, 1968, as the
end of my year’s protest.
Gawen Rudder (8., Jan. 21) will
support Michael Brown by carrying on
as usual. That is a personal decision,
but it cannot be justified by referring
to my letter, which was only men-
tioned in passing by your art critic,

Asian Output
Sir,
You quoted from the Prime Minister’s
speech to a Moral Rearmament confer-
ence at Melbourne (8., Jan. 21) some
figures of the average output per person
per annum in Australia and a number
of Asian countries. I would like to
point out that the figure quoted for Aus-
tralia’s output per person per annum,
as given by Mr. Holt, is SUSI 967,
and not SUSI 67 as published in your
article. This correction is essential if the
figures quoted are to have their full
meaning in relation to Australia’s role
of involvement in Asia.

The Angry North
Sir,
The article by Ronald Anderson
“The Forgotten North” (8., Dec. 10)
has been brought to our attention with
the request that we protest against the
picture presented of the North. We
question that “Stations are still cut off
for five months during the Wet.” On
very rare occasions some stations in
unusually wet years may be isolated
from access over land, but we might as
correctly say that the streets of Sydney
are subject to flooding. The inference
that on Cape York no one goes about
at night without a light because of the
number of death adders about is also
unnecessarily misleading. The same
thing may be just as correctly said
about Wentworth Falls or Warrimoo.
The statement “and a rifle is still a
man’s most valued companion away
from the homestead” prompts me to
offer Mr. Anderson a free conducted
tour of North Queensland if he can
produce a bona fide grazier from North
Queensland who will support his state-
ment. It is a pity to mar an otherwise
important and informative article by
knocking, another man’s country.

A Neglected Legacy of Vatican II
Are Catholic Schools
Really Necessary?
By JOHN MANNING
SEEDPLOTS of future immorality,
infidelity, and lawlessness,” fumed
the 1879 Pastoral of the Catholic
bishops against the public schools, “be-
ing calculated to debase the standard
of human excellence, and to corrupt
the political, social, and individual life
of future citizens.”
In terms of visible achievement, the
consensus of Catholic opinion would
opt for the parochial schools as the
success story of Catholicism in Aus-
tralia. The schools bear witness to a
long history of financial struggle and
personal sacrifice. It is little wonder,
human nature as it is, that the sweet
smell of success is eagerly associated
with the schools in the minds of most
Catholics. A broad sweep of history
posits parochial schools as the hub to
the mission of the Church. The schools
make claim on over 80 percent of the
financial and labor resources that the
Church musters in the work of its
ministry. In the face of such expen-
diture and effort, Catholic schools,
according to the yardstick of current
Church policy, are a sine qua non to
the very life and misson of the Catholic
Church in \ this country.
FOR all the years since 1879, the
bishops never spared a single re-
source in their efforts on behalf of the
parish schools. In a final analysis, a fact
that did not escape the episcopal mind,
the work of a bishop was to be judged
by the schools and extensions he blessed
during the occupancy of his See. By
numbers and kind the Catholic Church
in Australia was, with minor conces-
sions to a group of English Benedictine
bishops and priests, an Irish entity to
the core. In Australia the Irish way
was to become the Catholic way.
OrthodoLxy in the faith was assessed in
terms of Irishness. It was not without
merit for Australian Catholics, since
the Irish bowed to no nationality in
the practice of loyalty and devotion to
Roman Catholicism.
The 1879 Joint Pastoral issued by the
New South Wales bishops put the seal
on a policy of parochial schools that
would operate on funds raised by
Church authorities. The terms of
reference were simple: in the educa-
tion of Catholic children the Church
would go it alone. No financial sacri-
fice would be too high a price in order
to protect the purity of faith of the
little ones. The labor force in the
classrooms would come by way of
Bishop Cullinane... Grey Eminence
teaching brothers and nuns: men and
women bound by religious vocation to
the apostolate of the classroom and
marked by the vows of obedience, chas-
tity, and “poverty.” In point of fact,
the poverty vow of the religious was
the life-blood of the scheme. The
meagre stipends for the brothers and
nuns, rather than the payment of
salaries to lay teachers, made the
dream-like vision of the bishops a
reality for future generations of
Catholics.
Irish orders of brothers and nuns
laid the foundation on which the
schools would operate. The Irish Chris-
tian Brothers and their sisters-in-the-
cloth, the Mercy nuns, cast the mould
that was to shape the image of Catholic
education in the minds of most bishops,
priests, and laity. It bore small resem-
blance to Belloc’s “Europe is the Faith,”
but it was a boost and consolation to
the ghetto-like lives of families who
were poor, Irish, and Catholic.
It would be idle to think that at any
time the Catholic bishops turned their
backs on State Aid; on the contrary,
it was the system introduced by the
Public Instruction Act that carried the
bishops’ veto. After considerable delib-
eration, the bishops estimated a short
life-span for the public schools system.
“In a few short years,” according to
Bishop Quinn, of Bathurst, “justice
(State Aid) would be restored.” History
is, however, witness to another tale.
State Aid had, in a fashion, been for-
feited by the decision to set up a
system of Catholic schools independent
of the State. Despite the fond hopes
of the Catholic bishops for an early
settlement of their problem, the elusive
answer to the question of State Aid
is still far from settled some 90 years
later, in this year of 1967.
'J'HE ideal of every child in a Catholic
school was sponsored far and wide
by the bishops as they made their visi-
tations to the parishes. It was a grand
rallying point for Catholics, and the
few dissentients in the ranks were care-
ful to observe the security of silence.
Dialogue and the open discussions
borne at Vatican II were further from
reality, in the minds of most Catholics,
than the parousia in Holy Writ. A
system of Catholic schools staffed by
brothers and nuns soon found a place,
on the score alone of the number of
children being taught, in the scheme
of Australian education. Religious
orders were established in Australia for
the purpose of teaching in the schools.
The Brown Josephites were dedicated
to the task of staffing the “bush”
schools; while the Good Samaritans
taught in more sophisticated places. In
the manner of bride and groom, the
Catholic Church in Australia became
wedded to the parish schools. It is
only in this post-conciliar time that
Catholic critics allege the union of
Church and School to be a hindrance
to the implementation of Vatican II
directives.
At the end of the Victorian era, the
great flow of Irish migrants came to
an end. A new generation of Austra-
lian-born Catholics was finding a place
in better economic and social circum-
stances than had been the lot of their
Irish forebears. Catholic education
moved with the changed conditions
and furnished wider horizons; hence the
requirements of an emerging middle
class were grafted, without any proper
examination of the new position of
Catholics, upon the Church’s already
overladen commitment in the limited
field of the education of untroubled
children. There was always, of course,
that ray of hope on the State Aid
horizon to lessen the Church’s burden.
“It does not require a very extended
vision to see that the time is not far
distant when the Catholic schools will
receive full financial recognition,” read
the Christian Brothers’, Waverley,

N.S.W., Annual Report, 1918, “for
the work they do in secular subjects.”
No voice was heard to question the
wisdom of the effort. Catholic schools
and Catholic education were synony-
mous terms with prelate and
lowest layrffan. In the context of Aus-
tralian Catholicism, the dream of plac-
ing every child in a Catholic school
swamped, by far, all other works of
the Church. In 1964 there were 463,125
children on the rolls in Catholic schools
in Australia. This figure was in excess
of the combined total of children en-
rolled in all schools in Queensland and
Tasmania; it was also higher than the
total children enrolled in all schools in
Western Australia and South Australia
combined. During the period 1947-61,
the growth in the Catholic population in
this country was 65 percent, but the
growth in Catholic school enrolments
was 102 percent. The capacity to fin-
ance and staff the schools had become
for the Church, in the post-war years, a
sickening problem. The voice of State
Aid was again heard in the land.
An impatience with the murky plight
of the schools became a topic of much
conversation in Catholic places. “When
two or more Catholics gather together,”
a priest was heard to comment, “State
Aid is in the midst of them.” The
Catholic Press looked much the same
each week, since it was saying the same
State Aid things each week. Gossip was
cheap that certain bishops were in tow
with certain politicians, and State Aid
was only a matter of voting the right
way at the next election. But nothing
happened. Then came Goulburn.
JN mid-1962 the Catholic schools were
closed in Goulburn. A meeting of
Catholic parents voted to close the
schools in order to inform the public
of their urgent need for State Aid. The
Grey Eminence of the Goulburn affair
was a man of quiet disposition and
ascetic habit, Bishop John Cullinane,
Auxiliary to the Archbishop of Can-
berra and Goulburn, Most Rev. Eris M.
O’Brien. For a week, some 600 boys
and girls from the Goulburn Catholic
schools left the brothers and nuns and
enrolled at State schools; those others
who failed to gain admittance were in
the category of displaced persons, but
they counted their lot as the best of all.
After a brief experience of national in-
terest, the gates of the Catholic schools
in Goulburn were opened again and the
boys and girls returned to the brothers
and nuns. The Goulburn school closure
was, however, a turning point in the
business of State Aid. No politician
could afford to ignore the tide of events
at Goulburn.
State Aid had become a political foot-
ball, and a hefty scrimmage was set
about for electoral possession. In 1963,
the suave and diplomatic Bishop (the
archiepiscopal title came later) James
Carroll made successful connection in
Sydney with the Heffron Labor Govern-
ment and, subject to the conditions of a
means test, $42 a year was granted to a
student for third and subsequent forms
in private schools. A sigh of relief Swept
Parochial schools in Australia have
made only a minor contribution to
Catholic education.
the Catholic camp. The breakthrough
had arrived at long last.
Queensland has long given, of course,
the most generous State Aid; each year,
from State funds, Queensland pays a
student $36 in the first three secondary
grades, and $4O a student in the last
two grades. If parents satisfy a means
test, further subsidies and book allow-
ances to the amount of $36 a student
in the first three years and $5O a
student in the last two years are paid
for students resident at home. For a
student, however, who has to live away
from home, there is an additional sub-
sidy of $134, rising to $2lB. This year
a further per capita grant of $l5 a sec-
ondary student is to be paid by the
State.
The imprimatur for State Aid came,
without a shadow of doubt, in the
1963 policy speech of Sir Robert Men-
zies. The science grants to the indepen-
dent schools promised by Sir Robert
brought into play a jubilant response
from Catholic authorities. It was further
evidence, if evidence were ever needed,
of Sir Robert’s consummate skill in
judging the will of the electorate. State
Aid was no longer the idle dream of
Catholics; now it was a reality by way
of Government finance for independent
schools.
The principles of State Aid carried the
endorsement of the Australian people.
Catholics woke up to find that their
dream had come true, but not all
Catholics were happy.
A disenchantment with the parochial
schools began to find expression among
small groups of Catholic intellectuals.
The heavy pressures by the Catholic
body for State Aid set in motion
attempts to see the work of the schools
in better perspective. Amidst today’s
new world, the critics found small space
for the schools in the present life of
the Church. At this time, almost by
chance, the critics’ anxieties about the
Catholic schools took an articulate
form in the United States. A much-
esteemed Catholic writer, Mary Perk-
ins Ryan, produced a calculated study
of the points at issue: “Are Parochial
Schools the Answer?” (Holt, Rinehart,
and Winston.) Mrs. Ryan was loud
and clear with a negative response to
the query set in her title. In synopsis,
the Ryan thesis maintains that the
schools are a noose around the neck
of the Church. The ever-increasing
burden that the schools put on the
labor and financial resources of the
Church means, in fact, a delimitation
to marginal activity of all else in the
Church.
For Catholics, however, Vatican II
horizons project new visions. In the
aggiornamento, pre-conciliar parochial-
ism bows out to post-conciliar ecu-
menism, and a commitment to the
needs of man. It is the Church of
Pauline peace pleas, Canterbury at
prayer in the Sistine Chapel, priests in
freedom marches, and the laity chiding-
a bishop over his nastiness to a nun.
Small wonder, then, that State Aid as
the top priority in the life of the Church
in this country produces a pantomimic
tediousness for a growing number of
Caiholics. Despite the thoughtful
criticism of the schools by lay and
clerical critics, the bishops cling to the
old policy, which is way beyond their
capacity to implement, of
Catholic child in a Catholic school. A
few years ago, Archbishop Guilford
Young seemed of doubtful mind about
the value of the schools, but his more
recent utterances indicate unison of
thought with the traditional, episcopal
stance on the schools. In the face of
episcopal unity, the arguments and
protests of the critics count for little,
except that the next couple of years
could well confirm the critics’ worst
fears about the prospects of the schools.
Reports are rife from the inside-
that all is not well with the finances-
of the Catholic Church in Australia.
The Archdiocese of Sydney releases
the fact that unpaid school fees amount
to $1 million. In Canberra the Church
has a $4 million building-fund debt, yet
the current policy of Archbishop Eris
O’Brien is to embark on a $3 million

school-building program in the A.C.T.
Cardinal Gilroy has stated that all pos-
sible means have been used to raise
finance for the schools, yet Sydney is
still $4 million short of its estimated
expenditure in the period 1964-67.
Parishes sponsoring secondary education,
especially in Victoria and New South
Wales, evince clear evidence that the
financial demands of the schools are
beyond the capacity of parishioners to
meet the costs. Father D. Greene, the
parish priest of Queanbeyan, N.S.W.,
has a building-fund debt of $150,000. In
an effort to ease the burden, Father
Greene and his parishioners were in
favor of closing the girls’ secondary sec-
tion, but with the autocratic powers
granted to the Ordinary in such matters,
Archbishop O’Brien rejected the Quean-
beyan recommendation.
Today, in the expensive atmosphere
of modern education, it is commonplace
for parishes to register debts , of
$100,000; yet many such parishes have
an income of less than $15,000 per
annum. In such circumstances, it is not
glibness that a parish priest should re-
mark that he is pastor of a bankrupt
business. No wonder that parish priests
and informed laity dread the days
ahead. But the anxieties of the bishops
could well outweigh those of either
the laity or parish priests.
JN the post-conciliar Church ? the life
and work of a bishop fosters interest
among members of his flock. All this
occurs during a period of much criti-
cism within the ranks of the Catholic
Church, and a natural magnet for criti-
cal comment is the robust figure of the
bishop. Recent events demonstrate di-
verse opinions among Catholics on
sundry matters; hence no bishop is able
to satisfy all with his policies. The
common situation of insufficient funds
and inadequate teaching-staff in the
schools leaves a bishop vulnerable to
public criticism from Catholics, and
such criticism will become more in-
tense while he permits the continu-
ation of this unsatisfactory state of
affairs in his diocese.
In the minds of many priests, the
Federal election in November of last
year was a last-ditch stand for State
Aid. It was now or never. “Mr. Holt’s
policy speech came as a shattering
blow to the legitimate aspirations of
the Catholic ‘ parents of Australia,” said
Father B. A. Adderley, Director of
Catholic Education in Bunbury, W.A.
“Through frequent contact over the
past months with members of the Gov-
ernment, who can no longer claim to
be unaware of our problems, we had
been led to expect some alleviation of
our burden.” More direct attempts to
clear the political maze surrounding
State Aid were easy to find among the
clerical spokesmen. “One solution of
the Catholic dilemma,” commented
Monsignor J. E. Bourke, Director of
Catholic Education in Perth, “would
be to vote ALP in the House of Repre-
sentatives and DLP in the Senate.”
South Australian Catholics were
treated to a more subdued comment
on the elections. “We have no intention
or even desire to support any of the
parties,” wrote the editor of
“Southern Cross,” Father P. A. Wilkin-
son. “The ‘Southern Cross, 5 like the
Church it serves, does not take sides
where informed Christian conscience
can differ in their judgments and we
believe there is such room for opinion
about each issue of these elections.”
By way of direct political action,
however, New South Wales Catholics
outran their brethren from the other
States. In many parish halls, members
and candidates were subjected to a
State Aid grilling by priests and
parishioners. Bishop Cullinane, an old
hand at State Aid manoeuvres, was
quick to set the ball rolling and, with
Goulburn Catholics sensing a “kill,” the
bishop took the bit between his teeth.
“My own view, shared by a great num-
ber of knowledgeable people,” wrote
Bishop Cullinane, “is that the situation
is really desperate.” And with this view
in mind Bishop Cullinane pulled out all
the stops. “This is why I have claimed
that in the absence of something more
substantial than token aid,” the Bishop
continued, “serious and immediate
attention must be given to the question
of the Catholic community to continue
to provide both primary and secondary
schooling for its children.” Here was,
at long last, in clear form, comment
that the critics had been demanding
from their bishops for many months,
Bishop Cullinane’s feeler, however,
drew no response from his fellow
bishops,
But in the heat of the election, action
rather than quiet reflection was under-
standably much in the ascendancy with
the Catholic majority. The primary
solution for the ills of the schools was,
in such a view, a substantial dose of
State Aid. But for Mr. Holt the election
was, after all, only a canter, and his
“token aid” (Bishop Cullinane’s expres-
sion) was a shrewd assessment of State
Aid as a vote-catcher. For the pundits,
the defeat of Mr. Allan Ftaser, a long-
time ALP champion of State Aid
around the Goulburn district, was per-
tinent evidence that State Aid registered
a poor rating at the polls,

until the next election, bishops and
deputations had called on the men in
the corridors of power, but to little
avail. Catholics licked their wounds,
and some, but not all, spoke of new
ways to get the State Aid case across
to those who sat in the Treasury benches
in Canberra and the State capitals.
Hard facts demand, however, an altern-
ative that offers Catholics, in the post-
conciliar Church, something more
apostolic than State Aid politics, over-
crowded classrooms, a host of unquali-
fied lay teachers, sick finances (debts in
Sydney parishes approximate $9 mil-
lion), and a plethora of septuagenarian
teachers (brothers and nuns) at con-
stant struggle in the classrooms.
Experts agree that home environment
is the primary source of religious
education for children. For Catholics,
in the unfolding of a particular set
of historical circumstances, the parish
school structure has superseded the
proper religious function of the home.
The limitations of such a system
are felt keenly by an increasing number
of Catholic parents. In line with the
ideas espoused by Mary Perkins Ryan
and recent experimentation in the
United Stated, a more effective religious
education eventuates with parish schools
of religion rather than parochial
schools. For a fraction of the cost,
and smaller staffing requirements, a
parish school of religion gears itself to
the whole family, and hence transcends
the childish image of religion that the
parochial school projects.
,''y r ATICAN II updating is surely, in
any thoughtful assessment, an adult
commitment at the expense of childish
involvement in the curent life of the
Church. The pros and cons of State
Aid are, according to the critics, of
minor importance for Catholics. In such
a judgment, parochial schools are only
small fish in the renewal that -the
Council urges Catholics to embrace in
order to flee the marginal in their
lives, and enter the mainstream that
adult man frequents in his quest for
life.
Parochial schools in Australia have
made only a minor contribution to
Catholic education. The education in
the schools is closely allied, for the
most part, with the State system, with
the daily addendum of a religious in-
struction period that falls all too easily
into the atmosphere of only another
class subject. Hence it is difficult to
visualise any catastrophic loss to the
Church with the diminishing influence
of the parochial schools. In the Aus-
tralian experience, State Aid carries
little meaning, beyond the financial
needs of parochial schools. The sub-
stantial fees charged by the independent
schools place them outside the State
Aid debate. For State Aid the future
looms with uncertainty. It is the un-
certainty born of union with the hidden
life that lies in wait for the parochial
schools in Australia.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Moves on the Board
“NOW YOU TAKE Tosca.’ It’s
got everything, everything people can
understand these days—politics, a doll,
the lot. And ‘Don Pasquale’—that sort
of thing goes on in your own building,
doesn’t it?” This is from Sydney impre-
sario Harry Miller. “Tosca” and “Don
Pasquale” are the first two of the seven
operas to be done by the Elizabethan
Opera Company this year, and as a
matter of fascinating coincidence Mr.
Miller has been appointed commercial
and promotion consultant to the com-
pany.
Mr. Miller had just finished counting
the money in the till after two highly
successful pop concerts at the Stadium
when the announcement of his appoint-
ment came from the Opera Company.
But Mr. Miller has, of course, long been
absorbed in artists of what he, in his
less sophisticated days, might have
called “class.” He brought Rubinstein
here and organised the fastidious, suc-
cessful presentation of the Ballet Folk-
lorico of Mexico.
Mr. Miller is full of ideas on opera,
some mildly revolutionary—he thinks of
giving away a program with each ticket
sold so that people will know the plot
of the opera before they reach the
theatre —some very simple, long over-
due reforms.
The key to the Opera Company—
the orchestra—is being formed and will
be available for the major-city tour
beginning in May. This will release the
Company from the restrictions of using
the ABC’s orchestra.
Whether the Opera Company gets
occasional access to the Major Hall of
the Sydney Opera House or not, it cer-
tainly will have a permanent home in
the Minor Hall, which is useless from
every point of view to the ABC. It does
not seem unduly far-fetched to imagine
that, as a matter of tactics, the Eliza-
bethan has been making strong demands
for the Major Hall, so that when the
decision goes against it, the State Gov-
ernment will be in a conciliatory mood
and find funds more quickly for the
Opera Company.
The Miller appointment seems merely
a first move on the board. The Eliza-
bethan Opera Company may become
either the Australian Opera Company
or even the Sydney Opera Company.
Mr. Doug Abbott, formerly with the
British Festival Ballet Company, is to
be business manager, and Mr. Stephen
Hall, formerly with Covent Garden, is
Acting Administrator. (Mr. John
Young, the Administrator, is on sick
leave.) Mr. Tony Frewin is to be
director of publicity for the Company.
Other moves, the subject of interested
speculation, are Mr. Stefan Haag from
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust to the
Opera Company and Mr. John McCal-
lum to become the handsome figurehead
of what is left of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust. The Sydney Opera
House Committee, which in the past
year has become no more than a rather
unpleasant memory, may be formally
disbanded and replaced with a smaller
working committee which might effec-
tively take some of the load off the
N.S.W. Minister for Works, Mr. Davis
Hughes.
Silly Season
THOSE STEADY middle-of-road
listeners who take their daily dose of
2GB, Sydney, and Macquarie News
have been rather shaken by General
Manager Des Foster’s nonsense adver-
tisements which were slipped into regu-
lar programs about a month ago.
(Sample: A reminder that this is
“Be-Kind-to-Worms-Week.” Take a
worm to lunch today. If he’s had lunch,
take him to a show. Remember the
early worm never gets the bird.)
After a breathtaking pause in which
everyone wondered if they had really
heard that message, the sweet-music
addicts began to write tongue-in-cheek
letters back. They asked to join Swami
Uperjee’s special Yoga class to learn
how to bite the back of their necks;
they wrote for Dale Dalgarno’s latest
book, “How to Lose Friends and Nause-
ate People,” and for samples of Kiddie-
craft’s Mud Flooring. They entered the
Tired Mother v Contest, celebrated
National Procrastination Week, and dis-
covered the pleasure of uninterrupted
silence with the Nockenheim noiseless
guitar.
But the Bumble Puppies were the big-
gest success. Offered as half-bear, half-
dog, “the Bumble Puppy, specially im-
ported from Taiwan, is about the same
size as a kitchen mop and rather looks
like one, too. And it positively thrives
on dust and dirt. Just set this shaggy
little creature in the lounge-room, and
then watch how he rolls and tumbles
around and around, picking up fluff
and dust with its sensitised fur, then
romps into the backyard, shakes itself,
and is spotlessly clean again.”
Dozens of letters poured in for the
puppies, some quite serious. It was the
serious note in letters which had
caused Macquarie’s management to
withdraw the nonsense for a trial
period. “We don’t want to inconveni-
ence people,” Charles McLaughlin of
2GB said. “I had a serious letter from
someone who really believed we had a
leopard-skin available for the hunter
who always missed. And a very serious
letter indeed about our camel-fighting
tours in Pakistan. Someone didn’t think
we should encourage the Pakistani
people in their particular form of
tourism.”

Cecil Mann
PHIL DORTER, a long-time friend
and colleague of Cecil Mann, who died
last week, writes:
Cecil McDonald Mann, who died
at 70 in Concord Military Hospital
on January 21, lived for the last decade
or more in a warmly hospitable home
at Cremorne where bookshelves
sheltered superb Nonesuch editions, an
extensive Bible collection (his interest
was literary), a magnificent Shakespeare
collection, a complete feet-long edition
of Scott (he read it four times), a
wealth of exquisite first and limited
editions, and a notable accumulation
of Australiana, much of it signed to
him by the authors.
Bush-born and -bred (on the N.S.W.
North Coast), by his own account
Cecil Mann had little formal educa-
tion. In World War 1 (Gallipoli and
France; wounded at second Lone Pine
and again at Passchendaele; Military
Medal) someone sensed a latent talent
and gave him a Pitman textbook and
a volume of Sherlock Holmes stories
in Pitman. Those, he said, led him to
reading, to a vocabulary, to writing,
to country newspapers, to “The Sydney
Morning Herald” for two years, and


then to THE BULLETIN for 35 years,
25 of them as associate editor except
for a spell with the AIL in World
War 11.
As a journalist he ranged over most
of the field from literary and theatre
criticism and international affairs to
sport, although he had little liking for
politics and less for finance. He was
a thinker and stylist rather than a
hard-hitter humor generally softened
his criticisms, and a genuine “fair-
go” complex saw most aspects of any
arguments and sometimes led him into
tortuous leader-writing when he was
obliged to take a political attitude.
He worked in a smoke-wreathed
room with a cup of tea always at his
elbow he literally wore out the
office kettles on the old gas ring
and flayed his old Remington with two
fingers, his other fingers and thumbs
spread nut like a blur of bird-wings. He
was a painstaking and generous sub-
editor who left your copy - para-
graph, article, or story the way
you wished you’d written it in the first
place.
While working at THE BULLETIN
he published “The River and Other
Stories” and “Light in the Valley,”
ghosted Jim Tyrrell’s reminiscences, and
edited the first edition of “Coast to
Coast.” His own style terse, glitter-
ing, and generally shaded with humor,
as though he were embarrassed by the
compassion and sentiment beneath it
is at its best in “The Pelican” and
“Stiff Luck for the Colonel,” the latter
one of the best short stories ever written •
in Australia.
His direct contribution to Australian
writing in this period would certainly
have been much greater but for his
immense indirect contribution by way
■of assistance to other writers. Few real-
ised the hard, conscientious work behind
his judgments and encouragement as
editor of “The Red Page.” Nor could
anyone know just how many writers
sought his advice personally, at his
office and his home, but more books
have been dedicated to him than to any
other Australian —by Douglas Stewart,
Ronald McCuaig, Brian Penton, J. E.
Macdonnell, and Dal Stivens, to name
some of them.
Retiring in 1960, and suffering a
legacy of increasing pain from World
War I, he completed his three-volume
work on Henry Lawson’s prose, and
followed that with his selection of
Lawson’s best short stories. His last
work, “The Humorous Stories of Henry
Lawson,” is on the Angus and Robert-
son stocks and should be out in about
three months.
Anyone who worked for Cecil Mann
inevitably became personally involved
with him and incapable of a purely
objective tribute, but none of his associ-
ates would disagree on his main charac-
teristics. He was calm (from what he
saw during World War I he “lost any
capacity for surprise”); he was kind;
and he was fastidious in his mind,
work, and person. And always a sense
of humor.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Protesting as a Way of Life
ANYONE who is an enthusiast
for photographs of protest
marches will have noticed one
thing. Usually in the background
there is a small, dark-haired fellow
with an Edwardian “Your Country
Needs You” moustache. Also, he
wears glasses. He is David Nadel,
third-year Arts student at Monash,
President of the Monash Labor
Club, Member of the SRC, and
public relations officer for the Anti-
Ky Demonstration.
Your correspondent has always
been eager to find out the inside
story of protest marching, and with
a lull in between protests at last it
was possible to track him down.
First, why did Monash seem to have
a monopoly on protesting?
Nadel: Students at Melbourne are
more introspective and intellectual.
I don’t say that they get more prizes,
it’s just that Melbourne attracts a
different type. I could have gone to
either, but I wasn’t interested in
tradition, a new university seemed
much more interesting to me. We be-
lieve in action. That’s not the whole
story, but it’s part of it.
Batman: Do the same people turn
up at all protest marches?
Nadel: Bolte says this, but it is
not true. You may get a few in the
rank and file at all of them, but the
organisers are different. The organ-
isers for anti-Vietnam and anti-
hanging are not interested in each
other.
Batman: What’s the difference?
Nadel: Anti-hanging is much more
respectable. All four Melbourne
newspapers are anti-hanging, the
Church is unanimously anti-hanging,
and people who wouldn’t dare to be
seen at an anti-Vietnam show don’t
mind turning up at an anti-hanging
demonstration.
Batman: That doesn’t interest
you?
Nadel: Yes, I’m against the hang-
ing, but it’s not as important. Ryan’s
just one individual. So the Govern-
ment is murdering Ryan. Well, we
think that every national serviceman
who gets killed in Vietnam is also
murdered by the Government and
it’s a much more vicious kind of
killing. We can do much more
effective work on the Vietnam war.
Batman: Why is there such a rash
of protesting?
Nadel: We have followed the
American trend. The Eisenhower
period, as you know, was called
“The Big Sleep.” President Kennedy,
it’s true, did help to give young
people ideals. Until two years ago
we didn’t really appreciate what
Vietnam was all about. This protest
business has all accelerated since
then.
Batman: Were you pleased with
the Ky show?
Nadel: I’d be kidding if I said it
wasn’t a success for Ky. Before he
came I reckon 50 percent of the
people were anti-Ky. That saying he
couldn’t speak English was a real
winner. This slowed up all the ques-
tions and he was able to do the
nice-guy treatment. So anti-Ky feel-
ing dropped to about 30 percent, but
I reckon it was up to 40 percent by
the time he left. I thought our pro-
test was that much effective.
Batman: How was it organised?
Nadel: That was the difference
from the Johnson show. This time
we had a really first-class organisa-
tion. Mostly people under 30. For
Johnson we had only two meetings
beforehand. No one ever knew what
they were doing. Here we had plenty
of meetings. The first was on January
4, about 20 or 30 people—peace
groups, church groups, student Labor,
Youth Campaign against Conscrip-
tion, Labor youth, Vietnam Day com-
mittee, and so on. They worked out
posters, things like that. The second
meeting was on January 11. We
worked out a complete list of office-
bearers, secretariat, everything. The
third meeting was at Unity Hall on
January 16. Then we had the bless-
ing of Arthur Calwell, the unions,
and the Labor Pam. Remember
' c My God, Pilbeam! It is an anti-
conscription demonstration
how the police got stuck into us
at the Johnson thing? Some galahs
thought we ought to fight them back.
This was rejected. It was decided
there would be absolute passive resis-
tance. If you got arrested, just go
quietly and call your lawyer. Then
the idea was there would be J.P.s,
lawyers, and photographers in the
crowd to get a record of everything
that happened. As you know, the
police were good this time; we
chatted with them and everything.
At the meeting we called for volun-
teers to distribute pamphlets, to make
posters, paste up bills around the city.
We got them, no trouble.
There was a call for funds. The
hat went round and we got $65.
Then somebody suggested a news-
paper ad in the “Herald.” The cost
for that was $3OO. They got the
money. I didn’t think they would.
I think it came from union reps.
Batman: How did Calwell go?
Nadel: He was a great help to us.
He really made the protest meeting.
But he was no help to himself. He
obviously ruined himself for any fight
with Whitlam. The newspapers have
built up the whole thing as a cynical
act. It wasn’t quite that, really. But
he didn’t do himself any good.
Batman: Do you think protest
marches have any effect?
Nadel: Well, the public is getting
used to them now. This means that
people are. not shocked or startled
by them any more. So they have less
effect, understand? All right, then,
any future protest must either be
much bigger or much more spectacu-
lar to go over.
Batman: Can you do this?
Nadel: Yes. We have learned a
great deal since Johnson. It depends
on the situation, of course. But for
any protest now we can guarantee
1500, and if it’s really good we can
get 6000 like we did for Ky.
Batman: Have you been arrested?
Nadel: This is what we have been
trying to teach marchers. If you know
what you’re doing you should never
get arrested. I was arrested once in
Canberra in a Civil Disobedience
Campaign, but that was deliberate.
We needed the publicity to stir up
feeling about Vietnam and we made
the front pages all over the country.
Batman: How do your parents feel
about all this?
Nadel: They don’t like it. They
think you should keep out of the
public eye at all costs.
Batman: Why?
Nadel: They fled from Nazi Ger-
many in 1939.

ON THE MARGIN
The Sound of Moola
A CONSPICUOUS development of
recent years has been the frank
public interest in the earnings
of prominent people. It applies es-
pecially to those engaged in sport,
entertainment, and the arts. Any
regular reader of newspapers will be
aware that Fred Stolle has agreed to
play tennis professionally for a fee of
$75,000. Lana Cantrell, Sydney singer,
will earn $70,000 in the next six months
from her night-club engagements in the
U.S.A. Truman Capote netted a cool
million dollars from his book “In Cold
Blood.” And so on.
To my mind this is an entirely
healthy trend. It brings out into the
open a natural curiosity about the
monetary rewards of celebrities.
Biographical writers of the past have
grossly neglected the financial side of
the lives of eminent artists. What fee
did Fred Chopin command for a recital
at the peak of his
popularity in the
charts? What sort
of royalty deal did
Hank Ibsen make
for road company
performances of
“Hedda Gabler”?
These are the
things people want
to know, but the
authorities com-
monly disdain to
tell them.
To fill this need,
I have undertaken
the preparation of
a new survey that
will update cultural
history. THE BUL-
LETIN is kindly
allowing me to
print these few
extracts, which I
hope will convey
something of the
book’s contemporary mood:
William Shakespeare, notoriously
cagy in discussing personal matters,
admitted that his box-office smash
“Hamlet” had put him on easy street.
Asked by a reporter if it was true
his series of hits in South London
legit were bringing him in £15 a week,
he replied: “The rest is silence.”
The ace playwright paid a reputed
three-figure sum for his luxurious
Tudor-style house in Stratford-on-Avon
Milton was very disappointed by the
£10 he made from “Paradise Lost.”
“I need a new agent,” he growled . . .
Sam Johnson cleared £500 on the
hard-cover edition of his best-selling
“Dictionary of the English Language.”
“Serial and paperback rights, Sir, will
be the real gravy,” said the top lexi-
cographer as he relaxed at the Cheshire
Cheese.
Success did not come easily to
Johnson. In his early years in Grub
Street he worked for peanuts.
Told that critics were calling him a
one-book author, he roared: “Sir, they
are dammed Whig liars! There are
£750 worth of pre-publication orders
for my forthcoming ‘Lives of the
Poets’ . .
The career of talented Wolf Mozart
was blighted by his incapacity in busi-
ness matters.
At one time he was selling concer-
tos and sonatas for a mere $20 a time.
Even after he had composed the
highly praised musical “Don Giovanni,”
Mozart failed to wangle a rise in his
$300 a year salary. His story is a sad
contrast to that of Rodgers and Ham-
merstein . . .
The worst mistake in publishing
history was made by John Murray,
when he burned the sexplosive memoirs
of the firm’s star
author, Lord Byron.
“The stuff’s too hot
to print,” Murray
said.
Today, with
book-club sales,
translations, and
film rights, the
Byron opus could
be as big a package
as “The Carpet-
baggers” . . .
Many may be
surprised to know
that one of the
sharpest bargainers
in the music busi-
ness was none other
than cantankerous
L u d Beethoven.
Once after receiv-
ing an advance of
five guineas on a
minuet he refused
to write a note. “I
think I’ll take five,” quipped Lud . . .
Novelist Chuck Dickens struck pay-
dirt early with his comedy sockeroo
“The Pickwick Papers.” Soon he signed
a favorable long-term contract with
publishers Chapman and Hall. His in-
come from first-publication royalties
reached a peak of 10 Gs.
The astute Chuck augmented this by
sellout personal appearance tours of
the U.S. He also collected endorsement
and licence fees from sidelines such as
David Copperfield shirts and Oliver
Twist breakfast foods.
The big-time author was linked
romantically with attractive starlet Ellen
Ternan. Questioned about their associ-
ation, he replied: “It is a far, far better
thing I do than I have ever done . . .”
Other sections of my book are “Tol-
stoy’s investments” and “T. S. Eliot’s
tax problem.” Don’t miss it!

WINE OF THE MONTH
A Bright, Cheerful Big Red from S.A.
IN these Wine
of the Month
columns, which
have become the
major part of my
wine - writing in
THE BULLETIN,
I don’t often
recommend the
wines of a small
maker. One rea-
son for this is the
lack of availability
of their wines on a national basis. It’s
no good making mouths drool from
Gundarup to Gulargambone (the power
of the wine press!) as avid readers
snatch at the first BULLETIN of the
month to find out What’s Going On;
to rush to the nearest wine retailer,
wild-eyed and imperative, cheque-
books a-fluttering, to find out, “Sorry
mate, we don’t stock it.” It just
won’t do.
But there comes a time. I have
many great friends amongst the
smaller producers of wine in Aus-
tralia. I enjoy their company and love
their wine. I emphatically disagree with
M. Andre Simon when he says, “In
Australia, as practically everywhere, the
small man in any trade or industry
has a poor chance of survival. It is
certainly regrettable, but it is no less
certainly inevitable.” The only way
that I can see for a small wine-maker
to become other than a small wine-
maker is that he gets too big to be
called small. Which I don’t think is
what M. Simon means.
The smaller man plays a very sig-
nificant part in the Australian wine
industry. With the big boys blending
more and more (and I have nothing
against this at all) the smaller man
does preserve true regional character
with his wines. In some cases the wines
are not all that wonderful. The wine-
maker provides for a purely local
market and doesn’t indulge in such
quaint practices as improving the
breed. In others, he makes a quantity
of wine to be sold to the larger makers
and blenders for their own labelling.
The latter practice is diminishing to a
certain extent now as pride asserts itself
and the maker wants to see his own
name on the label. This is splendid
stuff, but it doesn’t necessarily make the
wines available throughout the country.
So you must gather your local wine
buds while you may, before they blos-
som into national profusion. Who are
they? Sydney is devoted to the Hunter
River crew: Draytons, Tullochs, Tyr-
rells, Elliotts, and soon, no doubt, lots
of Lakes. Melbourne loves the gang
from N.E. Victoria: Brown, Bailey,
Booth, Morris, Smith (sounds like a
cricket team), Chambers, Buller, and
so on. Adelaide looks north to the
Barossa Valley bund: Leib e c h,
Thumm, Hoffman, Henschke, und com-
pany, and south to the McLaren Vale
clan of Kay, Osborne, Ingoldby, John-
stone, and others. Perth prefers the
wines of a large number of Swan
Valley cygnets. (There are almost as
many wine-makers in W.A. as there are
in S.A.!)
Back to the Wine of the Month. It
is from one of those mentioned above,
Osborne of McLaren Vale. The wine?
D’Arenburg Cabernet Shiraz 1964.
The Osborne vineyards were started
by F. E. Osborne (yet another viti-
cultural doctor) early in this century
and eventually covered about 95 acres.
The first wine of any importance was
not produced until 1928, and from then
on they crushed about 100 tons or
more a year until 1951, when illness
intervened. D’Arenburg, his son, born
in 1926, began taking interest in his
early twenties and in 1957 took over
completely after the death of his father.
He was determined to succeed and has
worked extremely hard to build up
both the vineyard’s winery and equip-
ment. This vintage he hopes to crush
500 tons, most of it for red wine.
Like many other makers, he has light-
ened the old heavy style and his wine
now has more delicacy, still coupled
with plenty of flavor.
And like so many other small makers,
he would rather have the vineyard
name on the bottle and sell for less
than he could get from a merchant for
unlabelled wine.
With the emphasis D’Ary is placing
on the reds, it’s not surprising that
they are improving year after year. The
’63 Cabernet Shiraz was soft and rather
light, had a pleasant nose showing some
bottle age, and seemed a little flat on
the palate.
The chosen ’64 is a bigger wine alto-
gether with a bright, cheerful red color
reminiscent of the plush of a nineteenth-
century Paris brothel. It is undeveloped,
and this is reflected in the flavor and
nose. But the vinosity (grape character)
is excellent, and the flavor big at this
stage, even a bit aggressive. The flavor
is dominantly Shiraz. The tannin
finish shows the Cabernet influence and
is of the best kind, stretched out, soft,
persistent, rather than harsh and hard.
There is a slightly pungent quality
evident that will undoubtedly disappear,
and the wine as it develops should
round out, acquire a full bouquet and
rich flavor. A wine for those who like
to taste their reds and a wine to lay-
down for the future.
I don’t usually recommend retailers,
but feel in this case I must, since I
know that some of you may like to
see this wine. In Adelaide, Alan Archer
runs the very successful Chesser Cellar.
He makes a practice of featuring vine-
yard wines from individual wine-makers,
and I know he stocks this one. In
Melbourne, Doug Crittenden dispenses
charm, efficiency, knowledge, and good
wines. If he hasn’t got the ’64 yet,
I am sure he soon will. In Sydney,
who knows? You may have to write to
the maker.
There is a particular mystique about
the smaller vigneron. In fact, some
wine buffs prefer their wines to all
else. I think this is unfair, even un-
intelligent, for the big boys have the
resources to acquire the best of grapes
and wine-makers. But the smaller bloke
does have a more personal approach.
You can visit his vineyard and winery
and taste and argue. You know what
he is doing year by year and you
can follow a style and a train of
thought right through. In fact, at
times with him, you feel closer to
wine, and the feel and the taste and
the tradition and the glory of wine,
than you do at any other. It’s all part
of the gorgeous bit.
CELLARMASTER


The Soft Sell of Success
A BEAR of a man, but more suave
than shaggy, is publisher Robert
Maxwell, of Pergamon Press Ltd.,
at the moment concentrating his formid-
able energies on launching the new
edition of Chambers’ Encyclopaedia
across the world. This week he is in
Australia from Britain and holding a
series of “prestige luncheons” and run-
ning a clear eye over his existing
organisation. Obviously shrewd, tough,
and competent, he is both a millionaire
and a Labor MP for a Tory electorate.
He is serving his second term as mem-
ber for rural Buckingham.
“No one thought they would accept
me,” he said. “But they have. I have
not compromised my attitude because
I represent them. I was born poor and
I saw my father suffer the indignities
of unemployment and hunger. Now
because I have made a few shillings I
.cannot forget those days and I have
always done my best to prevent the
Conservatives from letting that sort of'
thing happen again.”
What England’s Conservative party
had to do with the politics of rural
Czechoslovakia in the 1930 s is hard to
establish, for that was where young Jan
Ludwig Hoch did his early suffering.
He had three years’ formal education,
Warren Preece
Robert Maxwell
and, if we can believe him, an outdated
set of Chambers’ Encyclopaedia to help
him when he left school.
At 16 he left his one-room Carpathian
village home to serve in the Resistance
movement. In time he reached England
and was absorbed into the British Army.
He was commissioned in the field at
Dunkirk and left the Army as a captain.
He was 21 years of age. For the last
two years of the war he was in Army
Intelligence—partly because of his dar-
ing which had won him the Military
Cross and partly because he has a total
recall on languages. “I speak nine
languages, of which I am most proud
of Hungarian, a terrible language I
learned in jail-—about the only place
where one has time to learn Hungarian.”
Among his end-of-war jobs was to
race into a captured German town and
gather up all the works of art, rare
manuscripts, misplaced national jewels,
and other easily looted valuables, pack
them up quickly and get them into the
back of his Army truck and away to
safety. Somewhere someone sold him
some scientific manuscripts, and after
the war these were shrewdly disposed
of, starting him on the way to success
in the publishing business.
In 1951 he bought Pergamon Press
for $20,000, and in 15 years swept it
into the first rank of publishing houses
in England. Last year he published over
600 scientific and educational titles, plus
120 trade journals, made a $2,000,000
profit.
“At the moment the Americans hold
99 percent of the world’s market in
encyclopedias,” he said. “There are five
major works. In two years we want to
get five percent of that. Quite modest, I
feel.”
His weapon is the revamped, revised
and “totally new” Chambers’ Encyclo-
paedia, which cost $2,500,000 to buy
and the same amount to update. His
method of attack, he says, is to soft
sell his product. There will be no pres-
sure tactics. Salesmen will be presented
with a Code of Ethics.
Maxwell feels that “some of his com-
petitors” have given him a golden op-
portunity to show up their “foot in the
door” techniques and that Chambers’
will profit enormously by their mistakes.
"I would rather sell fewer sets and
have the customer’s goodwill,” he said,
but despite his virtuous concern for
the consumer he is determined to sell
3500 sets in Australia by December.
Sometime during the following year
he will publish an informative book on
South-East Asia which he intends to
update each year.
He was scornful about the methods of
continuous revision used by Britannica
and others in their efforts to keep up
with the knowledge explosion. Cham-
bers’ will have a major A to Z revision
every few years. Next edition will
appear in 1969. “This' business of car-
rying on old material and having errors
and contradictions is absurd,” he said.
One gets the feeling that if necessary
he will keep it up to date himself.
Maxwell (a name which he happened
to be using in Intelligence at the end
of the war) only requires five hours
sleep a night. The rest of the time he
works. He has eight children ranging
in age from 21 to 5, four boys and four
girls, and they are his only interest
apart from the electorate and the city.
He writes to them endlessly and spends
as much time as possible at home, a
manor house near Oxford, dating from
the last century. He likes to live near
Oxford because so many of his writers
are there.
When Maxwell’s broker, Michael
Richardson, flew to join him in Aus-
tralia, a large part of the mail he
brought with him was from Maxwell’s
children. Richardson, who looks to be
very much a part of the Establishment
and is “above politics,” because brokers
have to be, has advised Maxwell since
he began using his first $20,000.
“Maxwell is, I sometimes suspect,
more of a Conservative than he thinks
he is,” Richardson commented. “There
seems to be absolutely nothing left of
the uneducated boy who joined the
Resistance movement. Recently I went
with him to the House. We left the
Bentley and I walked in beside him. He
sloped along in his elegant overcoat,
hands in pockets, looking up at the
wonderful ceiling. ‘Look at that,’ he
said. ‘You know that is our heritage.’
So I said, ‘Well, actually, it’s my heri-
tage, old boy, isn’t it? And yours is
something else.’ ‘You’re so stodgy,’ he
told me. ‘You wouldn’t think to go and
look at anyone else’s world. But I
found this one —and it’s mine.’ ”
Speaking Volumes
THE dissemination of knowledge,,
neatly distilled, capably packaged,
available in 24 volumes light
enough to handle, clear to read, and
uniform in style, is the job of the
Encylopaedia Britannica’s 17th Editor-
in-Chief, and its youngest in 200 years
46-year-old Warren Preece, who
came to Australia last week for the
Britannica Awards.
A thin, bespectacled, voluble man,
he looks much more like a reporter
than the key figure in the ivory-tower
section of a giant book company, and,
in fact, he has been a newspaperman.
He has also been a lecturer in English
at the University of Chicago, which is
closely affiliated with Britannica, and
a literary critic for the New York
“Times” and the Chicago “Tribune.”
“Being editor of an encyclopedia is
not the sort of thing that little boys
aspire to be,” Preece said. “But now
that I am editing it I cannot imagine
anything more interesting or more
difficult.”
His problems are not the usual
troubles that plague the city desk,
though he does have a continuous ever-
present deadline to beat as his staff
annually changes five million words.
He has also to keep everything within
the framework of the original 24-
volumes.
“There has never been a time when
more research is going on, nor more
findings being published than right
now,” he said. “And there are
specialists in every field. We can no
longer commission an article on reli-
gion from one source. We must use
13 contributors because the man who
studies Hebrew religion knows nothing
about anything else. It isn’t his field.
“It is also necessary to keep abreast
of changed attitudes and interpretations.
Take the case of Aristotle. A very fam-
ous article was written for the 11th
edition, published in the early part of

the century. Later, another editor had
this rewritten in the light of new
thought. When I felt it was time to look
at Aristotle again, I approached a
society of scholars who are interested
only in Aristotle. They meet every two
years in Europe to discuss his philoso-
phies at a special seminar. They told
me to put back the article from the
11th edition, which was once again re-
flecting the latest theories.
“Actually, the criticism that there
is a lot of outdated material in the
encyclopedia is true. For instance, the
article written by Einstein, though
superseded by new knowledge, is still
there, and so is Freud on psychoanalysis
and George Bernard Shaw’s atrocious,
wild, inaccurate nonsense about Fabian-
ism. But isn’t it historically important to
have them there? We include an ad-
dendum explaining the altered thoughts
and the changed facts. Until the last
edition we had two conflicting opinions
on the cure of the common cold by
vitamins. On one page we said it did
help, and on another we said they were
quite useless. Why? Because two experts
at two different periods had given
accurate-at-the-time comment and we
had all missed it. As a matter of fact,
anyone trying to find out about vitamins
has to look up 88 different articles, be-
cause using one on vitamins alone would
have meant repetition, which has to be
avoided.
"■AND it has to be avoided because we
just haven’t the space to repeat in-
formation. We can use extra pages
numbered a, b, c, and in some areas
where knowledge has exploded dramati-
cally we have,gone right up to double
z, but to alter the index for 24 volumes
by overloading is a nightmare possi-
bility. We have already added about
half a volume in the past few years.”
Mr. Preece commutes from his house
at Winnetka to busy Chicago every
day, has a mild spectator interest in local
politics, and makes no claim to being
a genius. “I don’t think encyclopedia
editors ever have been,” he said. “They
are the liaison men between the brains
and the students. I have a reporter’s in-
terest in everything, which helps. And I
have my subject, which happens to be
the development of the English novel.
I have to rely on others skilled in
specific areas of knowledge for the rest.”
The others include 10,000 experts
round the world (200 in Australia, not
all of whom, Mr. Preece told me for
my pride, are writing about-Australia,
either) and as well there are an addit-
ional 200 expert writers crouched over
typewi’iters in Chicago and London.
There is also a large art staff. In all it
costs more than a million dollars a year
to keep Britannica panting along
abreast of the new knowledge.
Preece, who became editor in 1964,
is not worried about competition.
“Actually,” he said. “I can’t tell if
there are more encyclopedias now or
if I am just more aware of them. But
if you ask 20 people what word goes
with Encyclopaedia, 18 of them will say
Britannica.”

Dinner With the Duchess
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
“mHE Duchess of Windsor expects
; ; guests to work at her parties”
we dropped casually into the pre-
dinner chit-chat. In the silence that
followed, we tried to recall more of
the Duchess’ theories about successful
entertaining. It was a bit early to sug-
gest that timid guests should be taken
out dancing, hardly tactful to say bored
ones should move to a gayer group,
and neither could we quote the
Duchess’ own words that “if the party
starts to drag, throw something into
the air,” having just done it.
As experiments go that went rather
badly, and from now on we shall have
to follow our Guide for the Elegant
Hostess, as purported by Florence
Pritchett Smith in her book “These
Entertaining People,” published by
Macmillan, America, rather more care-
fully. It is one thing reading what
famous socialites consider successful
ingredients for a riproaring party. It is
quite another putting them into prac-
tice.
There is nothing one would like
more, as suggested by New York social-
ite Mrs. Diana Vreeland in her rules
(a) to (i), plus Conclusion, than not to
invite too many married couples. In
her opinion this is suburban. We should
have pretty women, attractive men,
guests who are en passant, something
new and changing, for, as she points
out, this is the jet age, we should have
the flavor of another language. On the
other hand, breaking this news to our
All-Married-With-Children-Set will not
be too pleasant.
Failing a change in this direction, we
might follow Mr. Cecil Beaton’s advice
about lighting. “Ladies are better com-
pany when they feel they look well;
therefore, ideally, lighting should be
about six feet high and rose-colored.”
We actually did attempt this last
Christmas, but unfortunately the elec-
trician delivered bright red bulbs. Mr.
Beaton says an evening must take on
its own life. That one certainly did.
Our table decor is clearly inadequate.
What has happened is we have got
into a rut with the black-and-white
mats which, for informal occasions, are
swopped for Views of Old London as
executed by the shaking hand of an
early 19th-century artist. Candlelight,
when in stock, hides a multitude of sins,
but from now on a little more imagin-
ation is required. Mrs. Gilbert Miller,
who gives beautiful dinner-dances each
season at the London Savoy, recom-
mends a piece of fine porcelain as a
table-centre to take the stiffness out of
china. Or, if we could find them, we
might dye our old white tablecloths.
What one has to be careful of is
deadly perfection, otherwise, as Mrs.
Douglas Fairbanks Junior says, guests
will become tense. In order to avoid
this she keeps something around that
made her giggle when she found it
in some odd corner of the world, but
she doesn’t say what. Mrs. Henry J.
Heinz II goes even further. She be-
lieves a happy accident can unbend
things. We wonder how she would have
coped with a veal dish covered in
cheese sauce which, unfortunately, when
served, was discovered to have missed
one vital stage: it wasn't cooked.
Florence Pritchett Smith’s advice is no
matter what goes wrong, smile. A
hostess must carry on as if she meant
it that way, otherwise she is a terrible
bore.
So much for parties At Home. Away
fixtures may be more fun if we change
our previously inhibited attitudes. Cock-
tail parties, for instance, will open up
new vistas with Mrs. Smith’s counsel to
approach them as a sea full of fish.
“Dive here! Dive there! Who knows
what glittering object you will find.”
It may be an invitation to dinner from
the gentleman staring longingly at us
across the crowded room, or the offer
of just the job we have been aching
to get for months. “So hold tight to
your drink, your bag, and your cigar-
ette, and offer your little finger when
you are introduced if your hand is full.”
And the next time someone’s decor
includes roses, we shall reach out an
unerring hand, pluck a petal and nibble
it. We will also, at tea-parties, do as
they do at the Palace Hotel, St. Moritz:
dabble in intrigue, make a few secret
dates wdth the opposite sex.
In the more immediate future, how-
ever, we plan to amaze those we know
who indulge in The Sporting Life
“. . . where the male returns to earlier
reincarnation and is transformed into a
hunter, a sailor, a fisherman glorying in
his freedom and in nature’s challenge.”
The last time we supplied food for such
an occasion, the male complained about
the sandwiches.
From now on, as per Mrs. Douglas
McCrary’s OUTDOOR BARBECUE
IN WARM WEATHER, we are serv-
ing, during cofktails, Hot Italian
Sausages with Buttered Bread Rounds,
followed by Charcoal-Broiled Chicken
cooked with Sop Sauce, Baked Beans
Salad with Tomatoes and Mushrooms,
Hot Dill Pickles, Scallions and Tiny
Dill Tomatoes, Cheese Platter, German

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Knowing the Score
By PATRICK TENNISON
HECTOR CRAWFORD is involved
in many aspects of entertainment
these days, but his prime instincts
are simply for conducting. Set in front
of him anything from a symphony
orchestra to an 85-piece TV production
company and away he’ll go. “You can’t
really divide me up,” he says. ‘‘l like
administration. I like creating and
working on TV program ideas. Yet if
I have to go through a period when I
don’t conduct an orchestra somew'here,
I feel something is missing.”
He even talks in musical metaphors:
“I think it’s well known how I led the
band fighting for Australian TV con-
tent . . .”
With the sale of the new “Hunter”
series to the Channel 9 network his
company has achieved the record of
having major one-hour shows slotted
at peak times on all three major com-
mercial networks. As w'ell as “Hunter,”
the regular and continuing output of
“Homicide,” “Showcase,” and “Fight-
ing Words” will also be joined early
this month by a new Gordon Boyd pro-
gram, “Gordon and the Girls.”
With grey hair above his calm, even
features and a robust body that plenty
of weekend tennis on his back garden
court keeps in good shape for his 53
years, Hector Crawford has the air of
a man who might have been a diplo-
mat. But his path toward music and
entertainment was set early, mainly by
his mother who was the pianist, organ-
ist, singer, and teacher Charlotte
Turner.
From St. Paul’s Choir School, then
in the charge of Dr. A. E. Floyd, he
went to the Melba Conservatorium. He
began public conducting at 16, starting
with choirs before graduating to taking
over the Conservatorium orchestra.
Sometimes he’d conduct at two concerts
a night in different parts of Melbourne.
By the time he’d completed his course
in 1937, his reputation for conducting
was well known enough, but there was
still no scramble among the masses to
attend his concerts. Dismayed but un-
daunted, he decided to use showman-
ship and give them free what they
wouldn’t pay to hear.
That was how, in 1937, his Music
for the People open-air concerts in the
Melbourne Botanical Gardens began.
He recalls: “With Harold Elvins, then
the director of the Conservatorium, I
used to put out the trestles for people
to sit on, the morning before the
concerts.”
They began in the open air, but
went through stages of a tent and a
standing stage before moving to the
Sidney Myer Music Bowl. A depart-
ment store sponsored them at one
stage, but since 1946 they’ve enjoyed
Government sponsorship. Crowds have
growm from an early days 5000 to a
record one day of 150,000. That was
the day the Seekers were guest artists.
What w'ere the Seekers doing at a
symphony concert? “Folk music,” Hec-
tor Crawford unblushingly replies.
He saw that part of the reason for
the concerts’ success was that they were
always broadcast. So, he decided to go
into radio himself and, in 1941, be-
came manager of the Broadcast Ex-
change Company and turned out shows
like “Magic of Music,” “Hymns for the
People,” “Spotlight on Music.” His
sister, Dorothy, had been a drama pro-
ducer w'ith ABC radio, and together,
four years later, they ventured out with
their own company, Hector Crawford
Hector Crawford
Productions. Hector concentrated on
musical shows, Dorothy on drama.
The post-war years w'ere boom ones
for radio. Remember “John Turner’s
Family,” “Woman in Love,” “Sincerely
Rita Marsden”? They were some of
the 50 quarter-hour serial episodes the
company turned out at its peak. The
Crawfords also built up serial markets
in Canada, New' Zealand, South Africa,
Hong Kong, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and
a dozen other places.
“This output was all written by and
performed by Australians,” Crawford
says today. “It proves how' wrong the
people are who say w'e haven’t the right
talent here.” He sees the brightest
future for Australian TV production
following similar lines: first a firm home
market, then start exporting shows.
But from the start TV w r as tougher
than radio. For a while it looked good.
In 1955, the Crawford company did the
country’s first closed circuit TV pro-
duction, which was a ballet. The com-
pany was on air in the first week of
transmission with a married couples'
quiz, “Wedding Day.” Soon, too, they
had the panel-quiz “Raising a Hus-
band,” and the children’s show, “Peter’s
Club.” But all faded under competition
from imported shows.
“Practically no American hour show,
such as Hitchcock or Fugitive is made
for less than $150,000. And then these
shows can be bought here on a four-
States basis for as low as $2500. To
show what we could do given the op-
portunity, we made the all-film episode
of ‘Homicide’ called ‘Flashpoint’ and
it cost us $16,000. Actually, that was
more than double our average cost of
a ‘Homicide’ episode, but even at that
figure you can see how hard it is to
compete.”
“Homicide,” which now shows in all
States, was Crawford’s own idea and
proved a breakthrough. Today,
wherever it is shown, it gets ratings
higher than the other channels’ shows
at the same time. Even so, when it be-
gan in 1964 its production cost was so
far above what the market could be
persuaded to pay that the Crawfords
will reveal today they lost $37,000 on
die first 26 episodes.
He rates his greatest career disap-
pointment, his failure, in 1962, to get
Melbourne’s third commercial channel
licence, which went to Reg Ansett.
But there’s still continuing
hurdle of finding markets for his
programs. “I’m convinced Australia’s
best production chance is to concen-
trate on drama shows,” he said. “They
occupy 55 percent of all program time
and 88 percent of peak time. It’s this
policy we’re pursuing with ‘Hunter.’ ”
Well, as the conductor, he should
know' the score.

Slick Cat
The Platinum Cat. Roger Longrigg. St.
Martin’s, Melbourne.
IHAD hoped this week to bring you
a review of the Berlin Ensemble’s
“Mother Courage” at the Myer
Music Bowl. Or something on Wal
Cherry’s provocative psychedelic pro-
duction of “Through the Looking
Glass.” Or at least an appreciation of
Arthur Rylah’s readings from the Mar-
quis De Sade at Assembly Hall. But,
inexplicably, none of these long-awaited
productions has eventuated. In fact,
there hasn’t been a worthwhile theatri-
cal event in Melbourne for three
months. There’s nothing to sink criti-
cal gums into at all. Just “The
Platinum Cat.”
Well, it’s certainly contemporary.
The plot concerns a strip cartoonist
who parodies a famous progressive,
and that very morning Joan Baez had
locked horns with A 1 Capp. Its ad
agency background, too, makes it as up-
to-the-minute as spray-on deodorant.

PHILLIP ADAMS
Changed States
The Alchemist. Ben Jonson. New Theatre,
Sydney.
WHATEVER happened to the sin
of avarice which delivers so
many eager dupes into the hands
of that trio of rogues —Subtle, Face,
and Dol Common in “The Al-
chemist”? Like some other medieval
vices, for instance, gluttony, it does not
assert itself very strongly in our well-
fed, affluent, welfare society. Of course,
the flourishing of lotteries and Leagues
Clubs testifies to a continuing desire for
easy money, and although people ho
longer expect the Subties of this world
to turn their pots and pans into gold,
they still look to pseudo-science to do
everything from increasing their life
expectancy to improving their sex lives.
But, nevertheless, in our pampered, self-
indulgent, and egalitarian society we do
not see the fierce lusts and biting envies
of a society like Jonson’s.
However, the New Theatre claims
that “The Alchemist” is as topical today
as when it was written. The program
explains: “Jonson presents the acquisi-
tive society in which the ruling power
is greed and where immense energy
and talent, are wasted in pursuit of
different kinds of wealth.” In other
words, the New Theatre thinks that our
society is substantially the same today
as it was in 1610 when this play was
written.
Is this so? Surely the 19th-century
society in which Marx developed his
theory of Communism (to which the
New Theatre adheres) was much closer
to the society of Jonson? Our society,
on the contrary, is surely much closer
to the achieved socialism which Marx
desired than it is to either Jacobean
or 19th-century society.
If, as the New Theatre says, our
society and Jonson’s are similar, it is
surprising that Cedric McLaughlin’s
production fails to capture the atmos-
phere in Jonson’s England. But if,
as I think, they are very different, then

it requires a strong exercise of imagin-
ation to recapture the lusty villainies of
Jonson’s day and strong discipline in
the production to preserve the moral
toughness beneath the good humor.
Cedric McLaughlin’s production is
light-hearted and colorful, noisy and
romping, in a setting by Charles Ban-
non which shows London as clean,
white-painted, and Mediterranean-
looking. This is pleasant and attractive,
but it has the effect, like the production,
of softening the play. Jonson, like Marx,
was a serious moralist, and “The Al-
chemist,” while good-humored, is tough-
minded and un-romantic. But Cedric
McLaughlin’s villains are not villainous
enough. Norm Slater’s Face and Nan
Vernon’s Dol are both too engaging,
while Dan O’Sullivan’s Subtle has not
the authority of a deep-dyed, foxy
villainy. This is a difficult play, in any
case, for amateurs because it demands
stylish comic acting, such as we see in
Howard Vernon’s portrait of Sir Epi-
cure Mammon.
While applauding the New Theatre
for presenting a serious play, I must
berate them for not taking the play
seriously enough.

Summer Ritual
Archibald, Wynne, and Sulman. Art
Gallery of N.S.W.
BERNARD SHAW said he pre-
ferred to read a good critic on a
poor show to a bad critic on a
good one, but he hadn’t seen an Archi-
bald. It’s lively enough at the Press
opening with reporters, TV men with
camera crews, and critics (two from
Melbourne) waiting for the encounter
at high noon, but in an hour all is as
lifeless as the vast majority of the
paintings ploddingly pedestrian, vul-
garly vapid, and, with many pseudo-
contemporaries, stone cold with caution
and cliches; a chance to exercise allit-
eration rather than critical judgment.
The Archibald obtains the same irra-
tional and ritualistic publicity of
women’s fashions at Wimbledon: one
has as much to do with fashion and
tennis as the other had to do with
achievement and art; the Archibald,
like the other associated shows, gives
too easy a showing to works which are
clear evidence of the decadence in par-
ticular styles, which occurs when an
artist is no longer borne up, swept
along, tested and extended by collective
inspiration. That Jon Molvig should
have won with a work, dashed off with
a too-knowing brio and below his stan-
dard, reveals more about his loss of
compulsion than the Trustees’ con-
version.
Molvig’s is a superficial view of
Charles Blackman and one not re-
deemed by the irresolute flurry of brush
strokes in the background; even an
open satire would not have so reduced
Blackman’s personality. This and Mol-
vig’s portrait of Sir Charles Moses
hardly attempt the risks Eric Smith
takes with himself and, in another
work, with Rod Milgate, by squaring
up the canvas into cubist windows
through which Milgate, backed with his
own poetry, looks four times and Smith,
over-stencilled with his family’s names,
looks twice.
Smith is at least entertaining, and
is having some lively and legitimate
fun like Desmond Digby, who adroitly
slips between satire and documentation
to show Mrs. Carnegie six times on
pale pastel panels; in the top three she
is chortling and talking, in the bottom
three she is either listening to herself
or waiting for an opening. It has
amusing affinities with Warhol’s
repeated portraits of collector Ethel
Scull.
Not for Bryan Westwood, who
employs an academic magic realism to
show Mervyn Horton twice, once with
gauntlet to do battle with a knight
who is roaming the outback, and once
on a black canvas propped against a
headless statue; the face of woman with
cocktail is hidden by a blank paper,

but her mammary cleft is clear. In
the rear, his famous back toward us,
is Vermeer and above Mervyn’s head
gather clouds of hard-edged drapery:
an amusing inventory rather than an
assembly of symbols.
Shrinking from it is Sibley’s glow-
ingly elegant portrait of June Bronhill
who sees her opposite in the gaunt,
grey, cadaverous, and puritanical self-
portrait by Hector Gilliland. Thora
Unger treats an old man with tender-
ness and a glance at Dobell’s “Josuah
Smith” of 1943; Charles Bush con-
tinues to gaze at the world with a
dour, unflinching eye, and Judy Cassab
captures the mobility of Peter
O’Shaughnessy’s face, but the stillness
of the composition detracts from it.
The livelier color in the Archibald
flowed into the Wynne with Margaret
Woodward, Tom Gleghorn’s vigorous,
broad swathes of fierce color, Stephen
Earle’s reduction of a park to green
smudges afloat in lyrical yellow-green,
Robert Curtis’ clean and fresh abstract
expressionism, and Eric Smith’s dash-
ing double view of Ayers Rock, to be
renamed Larry Rivers’ Hump. Peascod
took a greyer view; Nancy Borlase saw
the landscape as a vortex to gumleaf
forms, Sheila McDonald as brown,
scorched and ashen, William Salmon
as a tight, intricate frieze of foliage,
and David Schlunke as a yellowed pali-
sade of tree trunks; to Robert Eadie
and William Robinson the landscape is
lush, colorful, and rhythmical all
refreshing views amid the dozens of
conventional scenes.
Fred Williams’ winning landscape had
its usual tellingly disposed whirlpools
of trees that give life to the subdued,
ochre hills; undoubtedly a winner, but
Guy Warren’s hard-edged glacier that
broke into ice-floes above a diaphanous
stain was as beautifully disposed.
Williams also took the watercolor
prize, which could have gone to
Salkauskas’ near-spherical flat, black
shapes afloat on a stained background
which suggested that Australia had be-
come part of Japan; Mervyn Smith
gave an expressionistic, disrupted view.,
of the Opera House; all in all, it
seems difficult for other artists to
achieve much more than decorative
caution from watercolor’s ephemeral
luminosity.
The Sulman, won by Louis James’
writhing pedestrians beneath some Pop-
Art inserts, was one true-contemporary
standard-bearer among the winners; it
and others gave a glimpse of viable
forms: Weaver Hawkins’ unequivocal
devotion to tough, rhythmical forms,
Aldona Zakaouskas’ shadowed collage,
Roy Jackson’s thick, solid forms, Paul
Delpratt’s solid image of a shark-mauled
bather bleeding red enamel, Nina
Meskenas’ equally positive shattering of
forms, and Kmit’s shadowed, poetical
blue dream world.
Certainly this annual jamboree re-
veals part of what goes on, of more
interest to sociologists concerned with
amateurism at the periphery of culture
or with debased and decadent forms than
to those avid for art: what they need
for 1968 is a show called Painting and/
or sculpture of the Sixties, for the edu-
cated layman has at present only a
partial and distorted view of the art
of this country.

OUTER space, the centre of the
earth, the Moon, the ocean depths
—we’ve visited them all on film.
“Fantastic Voyage” takes us somewhere
new with a of scientists shrunk,
with their submarine, to miniscule size,
who journey through the living body of
an important physicist suffering from a
cerebral clot unreachable by normal
medical techniques.
It’s an imaginative central idea, and
the film has a genuinely gripping open-
ing, a tauq beautiful cut piece of film-
ing, when the defecting scientist is
flown into America surrounded by a
positive swarm of security men, only to
be attacked by the “other side” and
dealt an apparently mortal brain in-
jury. Fortunately, the goodies have-
this technique of “miniaturisation”
which will allow a medical team to
attack the embolism from within the-
brain.
But after the stunning openings
sequence, the movie loses impetus and
lacks the prime requisite of science-
fiction adventures, excitement. Some
of the technical tricks are clever and
it is generally agreeable to watch, but
it ends as not much more than one of
those restful, pretty documentaries
called “Along Britain’s Waterways” or
in this case “Cruising Up The
Arteries On A Summer Afternoon.”
Of course, there have been attempts
on the part of scriptwriters and director
to drum up suspense. The scientists are
menaced by antibodies and white cor-
puscles, which only succeed in lookings
cute and pretty; they’re almost des-
troyed by a blast of soundwaves when
in the middle ear —this is one of the
more successful sequences, with an in-
teresting use of soundtrack. One of the
crew members turns out to be a Com-
munist spy, and a full-figured lady
scientist is included in the crew to jazz
things up. This is the highly publicised
Raquel Welch, a singularly dull, charm-
less girl (though impressively shaped)
who leaves no lasting impression on the
memory except of a pair of notable
buttocks displayed to great advantage
in a white scuba suit.
Considering that spies are even turn-
ing up inside people’s bloodstreams, it
is not surprising that the boom for spy
thrillers continues. Certainly in “The
Spy In Lace Panties,” Doris Day is
only mistakenly suspected of treason,
and spying takes secondary place to
romantic comedy and to knockabout
humor of the custard-pie and pratfall
genre. It is a noisy, overdecorated,
overwrought film in which a few
genuinely funny sight gags are well-
nigh buried alive.
Stanley Donen’s “Arabesque” (an-
other spy thriller!) is also over-elabor-
ate, both in its plot, its pseudo-elegant
settings, and its almost hysterically
“original” camerawork. However, it’s-
certainly active, if not comprehensible;
the cast is attractive and competent,
and Sophia Loren wears a variety of
eye-catching gear described by a dazzled
(male) friend of mine as “not only
beautiful but wearable ” If you happen
to look like Loren, that is; the great
majority of us had better stick to what
are optimistically called “flattering
lines.”

BOOKS
Auden in Abundance
By VIVIAN SMITH
Collected Shorter Poems: 1927-1957.
W. H. Auden. Faber. $6.60.
THERE can no longer be any doubt
that Auden is the greatest living
poet writing in English. For sheer
inventiveness and fertility, for unin-
hibited ease with language, modes, and
ideas he has no parallel in the English-
speaking world. But Auden still remains
for many a critical case. He is reluct-
antly admired; grave doubts cause much
ink to flow about the fact that he has no
universally accepted masterpieces, noth-
ing as central as “The Waste Land” or
“The Tower.” He is accused of flip-
pancy, superficiality, of being too clever,
by those who insist on the importance of
being earnest in literature.
In one of the best, because most dis-
criminating, exploratory essays yet writ-
ten on Auden’s poetry, John Fuller dis-
cusses in detail the conflicting attitudes
it arouses: “What dismays the Leavisian
or Romantic critics is Auden’s apparent
lack of centrality or feeling, perhaps of
sublimity. In the early 18th century,
the critic John Dennis attacked Pope
and his friends for supposed triviality,
for not being “tremendous” like his
adored Milton. The Leavis/Auden
antagonism is similar: Auden has a
remarkably Augustan conception of the
different kinds of functions of poetry.
It is Auden’s impersonality and variety
that confounds the moralist.
What also infuriates the moralists
and ideologists and sends some of his
most ardent admirers into fits of regret
is the way Auden ruthlessly revises, re-
jects, changes and eliminates sections
and past phases of his work. For some
this is all full of sinister intent. Others
can only wonder at the kind of honesty
Auden insists on.
This is not the place to go into all the
minor changes and variations that are
to be observed in the new “Collected
Shorter Poems,” except to note the total
and surprising elimination of a large
number of poems. “Sir, No Man’s
Enemy,” “Spain,” “September 1, 1939,”
“To A Writer on his Birthday,” which
Auden (his words) “considers trash
which (he is) ashamed to have writ-
ten,” are only a few of the most
notorious eliminations from the canon.
In a vigorously worded defence of
his practice, Auden says he has thrown
these and other poems out because they
were dishonest, or bad-mannered, or
boring. More defensively he writes: “I
can only say that I have never, con-
sciously at any rate, attempted to re-
vise my former thoughts or feelings,
only the language in which they were
first expressed when, on further con-
sideration, it seemed to me inaccurate,
lifeless, prolix or painful to the ear.”
“Collected Shorter Poems” gathers
together 300 poems and covers 30 years’
work. Auden’s productivity is stagger-
ing, and in front of such a varied out-
put generalisations are more than ever
likely to take on the air of the crudest
simplifications. Marxian, Freudian,
Christian: how many changes have been
and are going to be rung on these bells!
And all the subtle stylistic developments
and variations that remain to be ex-
amined, from the clipped brevity of
the epigrammatically witty, to the
richly resonant iambics of his great
middle phase, to the long-involved
Baroque periods of his later work, to
be counterbalanced by his present cult
of the haiku.
To look through Auden again is to
be struck by two major phases of high
feeling in his work which have been
insufficiently commented on.
The first of these comes in the late
’thirties and coincides with the develop-
ments in his religious beliefs when he
was very much under the influence of
Rilke an influence which is seen
at its most obvious in “The Quest” and
“In Time of War” (reprinted here as
“Sonnets from China”), but at its most
individual in poems like “The Prophets”
and “At the Grave of Henry James.”
These poems are marked by a fullness
of brilliantly objectified personal feel-
ing that was to cease to flow through
the dry statements of a “New Year
Letter,” but to re-emerge again in
“Nones” in poems such as “In Praise
of Limestone,” and the later series of
“Bucolics” especially “Lakes” and
“Plains” and in such shorter pieces
as “Precious Five” and “Their Lonely
Betters.”
This later phase of high feeling in
Auden’s work coincides with a renewed
W. H. Auden
study of Goethe (he has said in a
recent poem that he “should like to be-
come, if possible, a minor atlantic
Goethe, with his passion for weather
and stones, but without his silliness, re-
the Cross”). That the influence is com-
pletely assimilated and made both new
and personal is attested by many of
the poems in the later part of this book:
In so far as we have to look forward
To death as a fact no doubt we are
right: But if
Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise
from the dead,
These modifications of matter into
Innocent athletes and gesticulating
fountains,
Made solely for pleasure, make a
further point:
The blessed will not care what angle
they are regarded from,
Having nothing to hide. Dear, I know
nothing of
Either, but when I try to imagine a
faultless love
Or the life to come, what I hear is
the murmur
Of underground streams, what I see
is a limestone landscape.
Grace in a Foul World
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Diaries and Letters, 1930-39. Harold
Nicolson. Edited by Nigel Nicolson.
Collins. $5.30.
The Moments and Other Pieces. J. B.
Priestley. Heinemann. $4.45.
Harold nicolson should have
been an ideal political diarist.
Like Creevey and Greville, he
knew almost everybody worth knowing
in politics, literature, and the fashion-
able world. He had the entree to great
houses, the backrooms of shadow Cabi-
nets, and the Bloomsbury salons. He
was an intensely active man —sociable,
eclectic in his friendships, and pro-
foundly interested in the human per-
sonalities behind the shuffles and man-
oeuvres of party politics. His earlier
years in the Foreign Office had left
him with valuable behind-the-scenes
contacts all over Europe. He was an
alert observer, with enough prejudices
to lend salt and savor to his judgments.
Though there is often good reading
in these extracts from his diary cover-
ing the decade before World War 11,
the total effect is disappointing. Per-
haps it is partly the fault of the period.
On the domestic front, anyway, it was
a pretty dismal political age. There
was nothing much in the public images


of Baldwin, MacDonald, Chamberlain,
and company to stir the imagination,
and there is little in the private
memoirs of the time to render them
any more inspiriting. Nicolson’s com-
ments and anecdotes do nothing to alter
our impressions: with a few notable ex-
ceptions they were second-rate men with
second-rate minds in what Nicolson,
surveying the European scene, once
described as “a foul and lunatic
world.”
Nicolson, who entered the Com-
mons as a supporter of the National
Government in the landslide election of
1935, remained more or less a political
freelance. He warmly admired Anthony
Eden and (with some misgivings) Win-
ston Churchill, he bitterly opposed the
Hoare-Laval pact over Abyssinia and
later the Munich Agreement. Despite
this he was the friend and confidant of
men of all shades of opinion, except
the extreme Socialist Left Wing, which,
with aristocratic disdain (Nicolson was
always very conscious of blue blood),
he regarded as outside the pale of
reasonable politics.
Yet, throughout this diary, there are
repeated hints that Nicolson felt that
with all, or perhaps because of, his
wide-ranging interests he never really
achieved any of the aims he set himself.
He had been a promising young diplo-
mat and certainly a future ambassador
when Beaverbrook lured h'im away into
journalism. He became a promising
author whose books on Curzon and the
peacemakers of Versailles were highly
praised, but who never found time to
write the more substantial works he
wanted to. Then he was a promising
politician whom everyone liked and re-
spected, but whom nobody seems to
have seriously considered as a candidate
for high office.
Nicolson’s early association with Sir
Oswald Mosley may have had some-
thing to do with his thwarted political
career. He was an enthusiastic membei
of the New Party in its Tory Radical
days and was even briefly editor of its
journal, “Action,” before he split with
Mosley when the leader went in for
black shirts and bully boys. It wa4 ab-
surd to say that Nicolson, the contribu-
tor to the “Observer” and “New States-
man,” was ever a Fascist. But the
episode left him with the slight taint
of a maverick more interested in People
than Parties. It was not a good recom-
mendation in the Baldwin-Chamberlain
era.
Nicolson did not write his diary with
an eye to publication and his son admits
that he has edited out some of the
more acidulous stuff. There are some
lively vignettes here and there of most
of the political and fashionable lumin-
aries of that queer twilight world be-
fore Hitler’s war, but I found equally
fascinating the revelation of Nicolson’s
relationship with his wife, Victoria
Sackville-West.
They were, indeed, an oddly assorted
couple, complete antitheses in many
ways and yet utterly devoted to each
other; she withdrawn, nervous, fastidi-
ous, and dedicated to the literary craft-
manship that produced those minor
masterpieces “The Edwardians” and
“All Passion Spent”; he ambitious,
sociable, determined to be “in the heart
of things.” Their chief common interest
was Sissinghurst Castle, the Tudor ruin
that they made their home and where,
over 20 years, they created one of the
loveliest gardens in England. One day
it will probably be a place of literary
pilgrimage, but it will be to Nicolson’s
wife that the pilgrims pay homage.
They are quite likely to ask: “Who was
Harold Nicolson?”
J. B. Priestley’s “The Moments and
Other Pieces” is a collection of essays
(mostly from the “New Statesman”),
lectures, and talks written within the
past ten years. They are slight, unpre-
tentious musings on a variety of topics
from Marilyn Monroe to the minarets
of Samarkand. Priestley does this sort of
thing on his head. It is like listening to
the monologue of a sensible cultivated
old fellow comfortably settled with his
armchair and pipe. Occasionally, when
he thinks we may be thinking the old
boy is getting a bit highfalutin, he
reminds us that he’s just an ordinary
chap really and what he says is not
meant to be “literary” or “philosophi-
cal*” but plain North Country common-
sense.
This is a good bedside book. Nothing
to alarm or irritate. Pleasant browsing
along predictable paths leading to pre-
dictably rational, liberal, and decent
conclusions.
Undemocratic Muse
By J. M. COUPER
The Reactionaries. John Harrison.
Gollancz. $5.10.
THE roll-call of the reactionaries is
on the jacket: W. B. Yeats, Wynd-
ham Lewis, Ezra Pound, T. S.
Eliot, D. H. Lawrence no less. The
object is to inquire into the attraction
of modern totalitarianism to great
writers.
Was Yeats’ tendency fascist, as
Orwell said it was? At least it isn’t for
a democratic age to charge him with
being aristocratic. To make that dif-
ference damnable would be as fascist
as anything. And if we prefer Innisfree
to upstage Byzantium we may only be
proving Yeats’ prejudice that “the
middle classes have never done any-
thing for the arts” and revealing
why. Instead, we might care to answer
his question:
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?
Lines like those are aristocratic,
thank God. But they are not fascist.
They are .civilised.
And still as Yeats, in the ’twenties,
grumbled that “now all was type,” or
saw the old individual humanity re-
placed, not by new people but by
“something that can be chopped about,”
or diagnosed how “The best lack all
conviction, while the worst/Are full of
passionate intensity” in these things
we must follow him.
Yet there is in his chopping phrase
a smug contempt that is disquieting.
He looked forward, he said, to “an
aristocratic civilisation in its completed
form, every detail of life hierarchical,
every great man’s door crowded at
dawn by petitioners, great wealth
everywhere in few men’s hands . . .
an inequality made law.” I travelled
from Allahabad to Calcutta in 1945
with a fat banya who kept telling me
of the Bengal famine of 1942 and how
every morning when the bearers drew
up the blinds there were dead men and
women in the gutter. They were the
petitioners at his door, for he had
cornered rice: he had them on his
wealthy conscience. He went and had
a shower and did his pooja.
Prophecy easily becomes vaticination,
fascist, and bloody-minded, for human
beings are seen small and of no conse-
quence before events. “Love war,”
Yeats commanded, “because of the hor-
ror and because belief will be changed
and civilisation renewed.” His con-
tinual use of the word “heroic” is sini-
ster and depressing. It is not the aristo-
cratic ideal, it is thinking with the
blood to say that wealth, leisure, and
privilege are “soil for the most
living” among mankind. These are say-
ings that have their own murderous
innocence about them.
Wyndham Lewis’ thinking has a
commonplace basis and polemical ends.
He keeps scoring points, often against
himself. He lacks the critical imagina-
tion necessary to the man for whom
everything about him is wrong. For
such a man cannot imagine what the
right thing ought to be.
Here is a typical assertion: “Had
the best intelligence at any time in the
world been able to combine, the result
would have been a prodigy of power,
and the result for men at large of the
happiest.” The result and the condition
are equally assumptions, the claim
meaningless. Yet if we look around
about us, we ought to be able at every
glance to bury Wyndham Lewis under
this monument to his perspicacity. It is
not cynical to say so. Human happiness
needs something besides intelligence,
however high: kindness, to begin with,
and one could see this from the deriva-
tion of the word.
Pound’s exploits in Fascism, while far
the most emphatic, are for that very
reason less worth considering. They
are the less responsible. Criticisms,
shrewd, perverse, sweeping, piffling,
support each other like drunk men. It
is stupefying to learn that “the Duce
and Kung Fu Tseu equally perceive
that their people need poetry.” The
stupefaction isn’t much mitigated when
one finds that Kung Fu Tseu is Con-


fucius. One simply suspends one’s dis-
belief over the Duce. Yet Pound is
putting once again his conviction that
art is a necessity in a society and that
the values of big business threaten its
existence, because of a narrow, greedy
view of success and practical use. It is
a pity that his “passionate intensity”
should make the truth miss.
When Pound singles out for criti-
cism the tolerance of our century, he
is at a crucial reason why men of
poetic vision may prefer the short-cut
of authority to the permissiveness of
democracy:
Pity spareth so many an evil thing
All things are made foul in this
season.
This is the reason, none may seek
purity,
Having for foulness pity
And things growne awry.
Much of what is here quoted from
Eliot is the candor of an exact and
sane mind seeking after truth in self-
examination, unsparingly. Even in the
early writing it is the wit and not the
politics that is savage, and it would
seem to be a continuing distinction of
Eliot’s intelligence that there is so little
wish to impose dogma, to direct people,
so much personal respect.
JJARRISON tries to show that Eliot
was against reform. “It is not
enough to say, as Eliot does, that practi-
cal social reform is useless because we
cannot tell what the new society will be
like to live in, and because new evils are
bound to be created.” Eliot’s position
would seem to be not only much more
subtle than this but even in the end
opposite to it. What he objects to is
the reforming zeal that would put
everything right only on its own
assumptions and starting from today.
This to Eliot is ignorance, because we
live not only in the present but along-
side the past. His witty resentment of
suburbia springs from its attempt to
deny any past in which to live. It is
“the land of lobelia and tennis
flannels,” inhabited by “decent godless
people,/Their only monument the
asphalt road/And a thousand lost golf
balls.” In “Tradition and the Indivi-
dual Talent” he urges on us the
importance of the presence of the
past.
If I were looking for his like in
English politics I would choose Dis-
raeli, and I would think it a compli-
ment to both. Harrison marks Eliot
down for “pleading the cause of
minority culture.” On the contrary,
in this book the sanest apprehension of
the interaction of classes necessary to
a whole culture is Eliot’s. If, he says,
the reader “finds it shocking that cul-
ture and equalitarianism should con-
flict, if it seems monstrous to him that
anyone should have ‘advantages of
birth’ I do not ask him to change
his faith, I merely ask him to stop
paying lip-service to culture.”
With Lawrence we have the hero
again, with the addition that the man
who worships the hero partakes of his
heroism, a lurid idea in our time. The
resort to the primitive flame” of sex
and to blood sacrifice and a sweeping
racism embarrass the mind for the in-
sights of this man of wholly exceptional
vision, who might almost say quietly,
of anybody else: “I feel he should do
reverence to the gods in me, because
they are more than the gods in him.”
The Voyage to Brindisi
Pressed under steaming decks, they woke
And howled or cawed, scratched at the wooden roofs.
I heard the panic pounding of their hooves,
Wings flapping in squashed cages of bamboo.
Encased, impressed, they had been down there
A week, in their stench of feathers and horsehair,
Kept among split chairs, shattered tables,
Hooded, empty prams.
Creatures of many fables:
Trembling in that lashing cold, kangaroos,
Leopard, and lion shabby under his festering coat.
The sea road to Brindisi
Was long and aching, a carved groove of pain,
And I tried to quench them, to stifle
Their frantic quartets, to brush their bristles down
Under the bulkheads dripping with raindrops fat
As speckles of lard, under sweating decks,
I groaned among them, like a prisoner.
Gagged them with leather bolts, clamped
Tight their famished eyes, bound
Hooves and furred fetlocks thick with knots.
But even though, back on the tilting prow,
I stood braced, easy, in silence, muscles taut,
Against the whining of the wheel, the snarling rigging,
I heard them rise up, rise up
Like heralds, flaring bitter signals,
Crying now with human voices, songs
I recognised. Brindisi! Brindisi!
Black zoo! Black zoo! You condemn us there!
And I knew that in their brains, shivering
Down the gangway in a single cage, they led
Me, head on knees, bound in thick chains,
While round me beat those hooves, wings, piercing beaks,
Alone trapped, lonely victim, creature of all their prisoning
dreams.

It is very well put, if we were all
Ancient Egyptian: and it is an impiety
in Lawrence’s own reading of religious
necessity.
There is no denying, if we take
Harrison’s arrangement, that this book
ends in reaction in naked excess. But,
then, it could have ended with Eliot,
or with Yeat’s human voyage to his
Byzantium. The theme is of intense
importance, but the problem for the
artist is not how to manage a mass
society but how to manage in it: how
it is to be taken up.

Once More on My Adventure. Frank
Legg and Toni Hurley. Ure Smith.
$4.95.
People of the Inland. Jeff Carter.
Rigby. $3.95.
THIS book is the biography of Frank
Hurley, who in the thirty-third
year of his photographic career
wrote from the Teheran Conference of
1944: “I met all the great leaders of
the United Nations and did not get
very much hotted up and bothered.
They are not super-men. There is no
such word . . . My impression was
that they were the grandest types of
manhood of their respective countries
. . .” Hurley’s letter continued more
specifically, but, as with the whole
of this packed biography, one cannot
summarise adequately in a short space.
Sufficient to say that by this stage of
his career Hurley based his opinion on
close acquaintance with many great
men.
The whole of his professional life
had been spent with men who have
become legendary if not symbolic
Mawson, Shackleton, Ross and Keith
Smith, Sir Hubert Murray, the gen-
erals, officers and men of two world
wars. Princes of industry and princes
of royal blood he knew, but “super-
men. There is no such word.”
In his own life Hurley contrived to
combine rare physical courage and
daring, mental agility and artistic
integrity to a high degree. He ran
away from home at thirteen and his
father, an English-born typographer,
wrote to him, “If you can’t find a
way, make one.” Frank Hurley lived
by that advice and died at 76 sitting
up in a chair “as near as could be,
without benefit of doctors, on his feet.”
He detested doctors in their profes-
sional capacity. In his 76th year, in a
temperature of 114 degrees, he had
suffered a heart attack while photo-
graphing an underground cave on the
Nullarbor Plain, but had sworn his
companions to secrecy and had con-
tinued to work, in Sydney, until his
death. ,
JJURLEY clung stubbornly to the
ambitions and ideals of his youth—
to “strait Victorian principles” along
with a “schoolboy search for adven-
ture.” Wide-ranging and long-lasting
travels made times at home, in Sydney,
with his charming French wife and
children, rare and, sometimes, for he
was an exacting father, strained for his
family. Yet no father could wish for a
better tribute from his child than this
book which his daughter Toni wrote in
collaboration with Frank Legg, him-
self an adventurer and well fitted to
interpret his subject.
The narrative is excellently organised,
but here an incomplete list seems the
best way to indicate a few of Hurley’s
achievements and activities. His real
adventures began when he literally
talked himself into Mawson’s 1911-13
Antarctic expedition. He was with
Shackleton during the 1914-16 expedi-
tion, during which Hurley was among
the party marooned on Elephant Island
for 137 days. (Among the many photo-
graphs, some from these periods are

outstanding.) In 1914 he accompanied
Francis Birtles’ pioneer motor expe-
dition to the Northern Territory. In
New Guinea he photographed, explored,
and later made films. He was official
war photographer in two world wars
and in both obtained “scoop” pictures
as a result of daring and tenacity. He
filmed Middle Eastern princes and
chieftains and, late in life returned to
photographing the Australian conti-
nent with all the enthusiasm of youth.
He took film during the pioneer flights
of Ross and Keith Smith and was so
popular a lecturer and early broad-
caster that one of his “firsts” was the
first half-hour talk ever given on Aus-
tralian radio. But if ever there were a
case when one must read the whole
book for any real impression, this is it.
Toni Hurley and Frank Legg have
jiot written a panegyric. If, in some
ways, Hurley emerges as somewhat
larger than life, this is only because,
by most people’s standards, he was so.
His biographers have been very fair.
They give due weight to his immensely
likable personality; they demonstrate
his humor, resource, strength, and
integrity. But they also indicate those
times when his very single-mindedness
and utterly high principles made him
seem, especially to younger people,
rigid, overdemanding, and unsym-
pathetic.
JJURLEY’ S contentious theories of
photography are presented. Especi-
ally in war photography his aims and
beliefs differed from those of col-
leagues. It is particularly interesting to
read of his differences with Damien
Parer in that these two artists often
held opposing views, yet had in com-
mon extreme physical daring and
dedication to their work. The text of
the book and also the captions to many
of the photographs reproduced show
how dangerous many of Hurley’s
assignments were.
Jeff Carter’s “People of the
Inland” is a different kind of book,
although he, too, is a photographer
and a good one. I am not competent
to make technical comparisons between
his photography and Hurley’s what
more concerns me here is that he is a
splendid reporter. His book describes
people, places, and work in Central
Australian and other remote areas
which he visited by motor. There
have recently been a number of other
books of this type, but Carter’s great
virtue is his ability - a rare one to
make complicated matters crystal clear
to ignoramuses like me.
As one example, the chapter “The
Bore Sinker,” in just over nine pages,
gives a concise, simple account of the
nature of Australian artesian basins;
methods and problems of sinking bores,
both in the past and now; touches on
diviners and contains one first-rate
funny and allegedly true story. (Humor
is another of Carter’s long suits.)
For local reading, overseas gifts, and
school prizes, both of the books
noticed here are “naturals.”

MAN ON THE LAND
Two Camps of Farmers
IN all the divisions and arguments in
primary industry it is often
difficult to discern anything
positive and the easy way out is to
regard farmers as difficult people and
leave it at that. Nevertheless some-
thing has been achieved, we believe.
The lines have been firmly drawn and,
ignoring the bewildering array of
farmer organisations, there are really
only two camps now. The enemy is one
and the same rising costs of pro-
duction.
One camp favors, as a corrective,
high tariffs and subsidies. The other
camp favors lowering of tariffs and no
subsidies.
The tariff and subsidy camp would
appear to include most of the farmer
organisations belonging to the Wool
and Meat Producers’ Federation, those
(mostly the same lot) belonging to the
National Farmers’ Union, the Austra-
lian Primary Producers’ Union, and
the Country Party. The no-subsidy
camp would appear to include at least
the N.S.W. Graziers’ Association and
certainly a good section of the other
State Graziers’ Associations and
affiliated bodies which make up, at
Federal level, the Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council.
The numbers, the farmer numbers,
that is, could be with the subsidy camp.
But, of course, farmers are not the
only people to be taken into account.
Manufacturers are clearly not going to
do anything to lower the tariff walls.
However, it is just as clear that an
increasing section of academic opinion,
and this is the surprising part, is coming
in behind the lower tariff theory.
There is nothing new in this. Free
Trade or Protection was the original
argument which split Australia before
Federation and there seems irrefutable
evidence that one, at least, of the
reasons behind the Protection move-
ment was to find the money to set up
a Federal Government.
The wool - marketing issue, in the
broad sense, is the testing ground for
the argument as it stands in 1967.
Wool remains the most important
primary industry and the least subsi-
dised, although it is not, really, com-
pletely unsubsidised even in the direct
sense. In the indirect sense, taking into
account the taxation benefits accorded
woolgrowers along with other primary
producers, it has been subsidised for a
long time.
The argument, we believe, can only
be judged in the broad sense. This is
why we see no great harm in the
acquisition plan advanced, only on
paper, remember, by Mr. Bryce Killen
and his supporters. It is a useful contri-
bution, by no means the only contri-
bution, and should be considered in this
light, at this stage.
The Committee for the Retention and
Improvement of the Free Wool Market
has branded the plan a “blueprint for
the socialisation of the wool industry.”
Mr. Killen denies this and has repeated
that auctions would be retained.
If auctions failed and this is how
we interpret his plan then a direct
sales method and entry into manufac-
turing by a woolgrower-controlled
authority would be considered as a next
step.
The important thing is to build into-
the proposed plan a safeguard that
“next steps” are not taken automati-
cally, with too much haste, or with too-
much prodding from bureaucratically
inclined personalities. The wool in-
dustry, and every other industry, has
such personalities, and bureaucracy
comes into costs. It may be that we
have come so far along the subsidy road
that we cannot turn back.
The dairy industry, just like the wool
industry, has its factions, and the direct
subsidy (the small part of the whole
subsidy to dairying) is to be renegoti-
ated in June. Our guess is that it must
lie somewhere between the minimum
$27 million and the maximum $36 mil-
lion, called for by the Dairy Council
and the APPU respectively.
there is a big wheat purchase
pretty soon now by Mainland
China, the wheat subsidy could be the
paralysing punch to the Australian tax-
payer in 1967. The harvest seems qqite
certain to be an all-time record—some-
where in the vicinity of 400 million
bushels or even more than 400 million.
Total sales, to date, are a mere 80
million bushels. Still, there is no need
to panic just yet.
And, in truth, Australia is still the
best country in the world. But how
will it stay that way if we continue to
allow costs to rise and then put the
tail in the dog’s mouth with more
subsidies? The alarming inflation in
land values directly caused by the
tariff-subsidy system (plus some help
from the Country Party) is the
best indication to the farmer of what
is going wrong.
This brings us back to the Killen
plan for the acquisition of wool, be-
cause it appears to leave out all men-
tion of subsidy. This is its paradox.
To get general woolgrower support
there would have to be a subsidy
clause. As a matter of fact, the luke-
warm praise, and in some cases com-
plete and utter silence, from the wool-
grower bodies which make up the
Wool and Meat Producers’ Federation
is pretty significant. It would not be
at all surprising if the plan, emanating
(on the surface anyway) from a
Graziers’ man, was turned into a sec-
ondary issue, compared with the tariff
question, by the N.S.W. Graziers’ As-
sociation, which must endorse it if it is
ever to get general Graziers’ approval.
How far can the Graziers’ get on
their tariff tack? How much support
can they get from outside their own
body? They can get, we think, more
support from non-Graziers’ farmers
than the other farmer organisations
care to admit. In this sense they could
be on a winner. They could also run
into a brick wall put up by manufac-
turing interests.

Monash Again
WORD has come out from Mon-
ash University, Victoria, telling
farmers which products are
most likely to be in demand at home
and abroad between now and 1980.
The predictions result from a study of
world and local prospects undertaken
by Professor F. H. Gruen and col-
leagues in the Department of Econ-
omics at Monash.
The United States Department of
Agriculture requested the information
and paid for the costs of the study.
The complete, ' unabridged report is
entitled “Long Term Agricultural
Supply and Demand Projections; Aus-
tralia 1965 to 1980.” Copies in multi-
lithed form may be purchased from
the Economics Department, Monash
University, Wellington Road, Clayton,
Vic., for $6 apiece. A shorter, and
it is to be hoped more readable, version
is to be published soon by the USDA.
Usually when people attempt to
foretell the future they are careful to
hedge their predictions with plenty of
“ifs” and “mights.” The authors of
this report have also left enough funk-
holes open for their safe retreat if
necessary, but, compared with other
forecasters, their statements sound con-
vincingly postive. Home markets can,
of course, be forecast with more cer-
tainty than export markets because
trends in local consumers’ tastes and
wants can be charted in much greater
detail. Also, one’s own Government’s
policy and its effects can usually be
gauged with more assurance than the
possible tactics of foreign governments.
'J'HE outlook for wool is gloomy, but
for beef it is bright. The prospects
for mutton are also good, but somewhat
less favorable for lamb. Our export
butter earnings are more likely to dim-
inish than expand. World prices for
wheat, oats, and barley will probably
not rise, and may even fall.
The authors admit quite matter-of-
factly that the world wheat market,
and particularly of Australian exports,
is firmly in New China’s grasp. And
what China will do with it is anybody’s
guess. To help feed her rising popu-
lation she will almost certainly continue
importing wheat, but whether in
greater or lesser volume probably the
Chinese leadership itself could not say
just now. New China has recently
signed a contract with Canada to take
a very large slice of her next three
harvests. So this much at least can be
said: for the next few years we will
almost definitely lose our place as
China’s main supplier.
We might be able to win modestly
enhanced markets for oats and barley
in various parts of the world. We al-
ready have a good stake in the world’s
trade in these two grains. Our oats
comprise about a quarter of the total
market and our barley figures are about

one-tenth of all sales. No significant
development in exporting pig or poultry
meats is foreseen, although, of course,
the home market for both of these, but
especially poultry, is growing greatly.
We are now the second largest ex-
porter of beef and veal, the quantity
sent abroad having risen two-and-a-
half times and the value of the money
received for it five times over the past
decade. This unexpectedly lucrative
trade will probably not continue to ex-
pand at anything like the same rate dur-
ing the next ten years, and our
customers may change, but a buoyant
market is confidently predicted none-
theless by Professor Gruen et al.
Sheep meat sales are very interesting.
Up till 1960 we were able to sell very
much more lamb than mutton.
Since then the value of our overseas
mutton market has risen rapidly and
now brings in three times tbe money
than that brought in from the
lamb market. We will probably soon
capture half the total world mutton
trade the volume of which is
swelling fast. The U.S.A., Japan, and
Greece have been among our most im-
portant new buyers of mutton and the
European Economic Community is ex-
pected to hop in soon for its chop.
When it starts, the EEC could quickly
become a big buyer. Meanwhile, the
U.K., still our best customer, will un-
doubtedly increase its purchases.
home here, interesting changes
in our eating habits have occurred
since World War 11. Our drinking
habits have changed even more extra-
ordinarily. For unaccountable reasons
we now down more than twice as much
beer and wine. Each man, woman, and
child of us now swallows almost 38
gallons of beer and two gallons of wine
every year. Thus tanked, our bellies
have less space for red meat, bread,
butter, jam, and potatoes. Apparently,
however, our kids have not hit the
grog like their parents, because milk
consumption has climbed considerably.
The school milk scheme would be
partly responsible for this. Our per
capita consumption is now a point over
29 gallons, whereas in 1938-39 it was
23.4 gallons a year.
Nowadays, each of us eats about
half an egg a week less than our par-
ents. But ten years ago we were eating
even fewer eggs. Despite the recent
difficulties in this industry, the Monash
people now paint a fairly rosy future
for egg producers. They even speak of
a possible doubling of our export sales.
What the future holds for the
sugarcane growers appears to be rather
obscure. We are now consuming appre-
ciably less than we used to eat in the
direct form. This might be because
tea drinking has also declined
markedly. On the other hand, coffee
consumption has quadrupled. But we
are now using more sugar by way of
manufactured products, so that total
local per capita consumption has
remained fairly constant over the
years. The export outlook is dicy.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Get on the Move!
TO hell with the balance of payments; let’s concentrate
on getting the economy on the move again. Already
there are signs of some concern in official circles about
the prospect of a balance of payments deficit and there
is no doubt that the country must not set up a standard of
living that is beyond its means. There is also no doubt that
on the surface we look to be in danger of doing just that,
even at the current reduced level of activity in the economy;
we would do it even more if we got back to a more
respectable rate of economic growth. The latest international
reserve figures show that, in the December half year, our
balances abroad fell by $127 million to $1248 million, their
lowest point since May, 1963. It is true that the drop is
not as bad as it seems; the figures include the repayment of
a $56 million London loan and do not include the $22.3
million proceeds of the December U.S. loan.
But the main reason we are spending overseas more
than we are earning is our mounting defence bill, and
there is a good case to be made out for this sort of spending
at the moment to come out of our accumulated fat without
encouraging the authorities to limit our spending for
development within reason. Not even the prospect of
record export earnings, helped along by this year’s huge
wheat crop and the first major sales of iron ore to Japan,
will be able to meet the rises in our imports bill, even while
the economy is running along so far under capacity in so
many areas.
And there is mounting evidence that, at last, the
economy is beginning to pick up. Production figures for the
December quarter were significantly up for most sectors,
except those related to building - and television sets. Even
the motor industry seems to be stirring. The interim company
reports now coming out are admittedly a mixed bag, but
most show either the first signs of recovery in the December
quarter, or expectations of improvement in 1967, even if
things were very difficult, indeed, in the first half of the
current financial year.
Apart from the likelihood of mounting imports as the
economy moves ahead faster, there are still good reasons
for a nervous twinge here and there about our payments
position: the extent to which we depend on Japan as a
market is quietly terrifying in view of the ups and downs
possible in that country’s economy; the continued failure of
the world’s financial leaders to find some acceptable solution
to the liquidity problem that is at present limiting world
trade is far from cheering; the continued downhill slide,
despite the Vietnam war, of commodity prices (surely sugar
must hit bottom soon?) is a serious factor; the limits set
by the U.K. and U.S. authorities on investment here have
not yet really begun to bite hard; and the possibility of peace
sooner or later in Vietnam, or of an American recession,
or of Britain going into the EEC, could affect many of our
exports. And there is a very real problem with domestic
costs, which are showing alarming tendencies to rise for
reasons that can be laid at the door of the official rather
than the private sector of the economy, and that certainly
has nothing to do with excessive demand. In many cases,
they may be related directly to the anti-inflationary
measures taken by the authorities in their neurotic fixation
with demand inflation.
In any event, there is no point at all in struggling up
the recovery road with one eye over our shoulder on the
MEN AND MATTERS
FROM last week there has been a
new man in charge of the Aus-
tralian operations of Rothmans,
but the man at the top of the com-
pany and its overall policy is still Mr.
Ronald Arthur Irish, the Sydney
accountant-company director who is
very much the boss of the local Roth-
mans company. He is not only its
chairman but also its chief executive.
What he says goes.
So the resignation of 43-year-old
managing director David N. Engela
after nine years as operational chief
in Australia and the appointment of
the general manager, 45-year-old Mr.
R. F. W. Watson, as a director to
replace Mr. Engela (there will be no
managing director, but the company
stresses that Mr. Watson will be just
as much in charge of operations as
Mr. Engela was) will not mean any
major change in the company’s overall
policy, although there could be a
greater emphasis on merchandising in
the future.
For the new operational chief is very
much a merchandising rather than a
tobacco man. And with its share of
the market slipping (as British Tobacco
successfully recovers large slices of the
market it steadily lost in the late
19505), Rothmans needs something: it
relies heavily on only two brands and
has not been enormously successful
with new brands introduced to soften
that dependence. Riggio was no
dramatic success, the expensively pro-
moted Grenadiers has been solid rather
than spectacular, and others like
Carlisle and Princeton appear to have
been marketing failures.
Engela is resigning to go back to
South Africa (for personal reasons, the
company insists) to take up an un-
specified appointment with the Roth-
mans group, whose South African
operations are far smaller than in Aus-
tralia. (Britain is the group’s biggest
centre and less than ten percent of
the group’s shareholding is now held
in South Africa.)
YHIS represents quite a change of
plan for David Engela, who be-
came a naturalised Australian citizen
five or six years ago. Engela was in
South Africa visiting his family (and
seeing the South African company)
when his resignation as of January 24
was announced in Sydney. He returned
last weekend to pick up his family (his
South African-born wife and two small
children), clean up his affairs here, and
sell his house in Gordon.
Engela, who comes from a long line
of pioneer Afrikaner tobacco growers
in the Transvaal, is one of the “new
breed” of South African businessmen,
the Stellenbosch University graduates.
He gained his
Economics degree
there after being
schooled at Pre-
toria High School.
He was studying
accountancy when
he joined Roth-
mans in South
Africa as a liaison
executive and
later became sales
secretary before
going to the
gr o u p’s head-
quarters in London in 1954 as an alter-
nate director and the chairman’s “per-
sonal representative.” Then he held
various senior executive posts with
Rothmans companies in Canada, Hol-
land, and America before coming to
Australia in 1957 as general manager.
During his nine 'y ear s in Australia,
Rothmans’ turnover j-umped by more
than five times to about $lOO million
a year.
Watson will be the fourth boss of
Rothmans’ operations in Australia. The
first was Charles Hilterman, in 1956,
who set the company up; the second
was the energetic “Paddy” O’Neil-
Dunne, who put the company firmly on
the road to success.

balance of payments; that can be looked at more seriously
in six months or so. The implications of the recent successes
in the search for oil in Australia on our trade figures are
staggering in terms of the potential import savings (and this
is quite apart from the prospective export earnings from iron
ore or of the other minerals), so that the balance or
payments problems that seem so real now may have
disappeared by then.
We have to take the risk that the problem will be solved,
otherwise the current economic recovery may as well not
even begin to get off the ground. And the risk is real; unless
we have solved our payments problems within the next year
or so, the economy could very well find itself being ham-
strung once again, this time for balance of payments reasons.
The clammy hand of restraint would once again be upon
us all. The prospect of this would be enough to make most
businessmen lose the small bit of confidence that they have
at last managed to summon up after a year’s nail-chewing.
For the time being, the balance of payments risk must be
ignored.
The situation, then, is one that calls for a sensibly
optimistic approach; neither reckless confidence nor unreason-
able caution should influence those who make business
decisions.
This year could be the testing time for the Treasury
view, expressed just a year ago, that people should not be
over-cautious about the balance of payments; “Economic
growth can suffer if an excess of caution leads to measures
which divert resources from efficient to less efficient uses
as can happen when imports are arbitarily curtailed
or for that matter when exports are artificially stimulated.”
It appears to have been largely on the evidence of this
statement and from discussions with people close to the
Treasury that “The Economist” takes the view in its current
survey of Australia (an article from which is printed on page
47 of this issue) that the Australian authorities are not
neurotic about the balance of payments or the size of the
reserves. It is to be hoped that “The Economist” is right.
born immigrants to Australia to become
a naturalised Australian has been in
Australia since shortly after the war.
Born in Middlesex but educated around
the world as his parents moved from
country to country because of his
father’s job, he joined the fifth regi-
ment of Ghurkas in the Indian Army
as a private during the war. After
fighting in China, Burma, and India, he
ended up as a major. During this time
he met plenty of Australians, liked them,
and thought he’d try the place. So after
a spell in Britain and the U.S., he did
so, marrying a local girl and producing
two sons, now 18 and 16. He lives at
North Parramatta, not too far way from
the factory at Granville.
■JJNLIKE David Engela, Reg Watson
has no background in tobacco. He
worked four years with Gilbert Lodge,
the engineering people, ending up as
merchandising manager before getting
into the tobacco business as N.S.W.
manager of Godfrey Phillips for two
years until he moved over to Rothmans
as a salesman in 1956. His career with
Rothmans has mirrored his progress in
the Army, as he worked his way up
through the ranks. He quickly became
sales secretary, then N.S.W. manager,
Victorian manager, Australian sales
manager, and 12 months ago became
general manager.

THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: Australia’s overseas reserves
lost s3Bm. during the December quarter to finish 1966
at $1248m., some s9m. above their position at the
end of 1965; much of the inferior situation is ascribed
to considerably lower capital inflow, sloom. for the
quarter against $254m. in the corresponding 1965
period and the least inflow in this quarter for five
years . . . The deficit on current account stands at
$137m., although the three months actually showed a
sssm. trading surplus.
The (national) consumer price index went up 0.9
percent in the December quarter . . . Building materials
and television sets are the only drab features among
the latest statistics of industrial production . . . The
value of office approvals reached s6om. in 1966,
s4sm. less than for 1965; factory approvals declined
by s7m. to sl24m. . . . More houses and flats were
started between October and December than in any
previous corresponding period.
For the markets i Toward the close of last
week’s dealings, Australian share markets appeared to
enter a very careful phase, even good reports being
treated with circumspection. Leaders and metals were
drifting.
A I percent cut in Bank Rate did not inspire London,
which kept industrials trading wanly . . . Chances of
easier credit brought some hope to Wall Street, yet
another advance was cut short on Friday.
For companies: The current year has begun to
look even better for the hire-purchase financiers than
1965-66 . . . Ushering in the December half-year
parade came Custom Credit, whose profit went up 10.3
percent to $1,696,750 as gross receivables added s7m.,
and Associated Securities, with a 15.5 percent earnings
advance to $860,033 and receivables up by sl2m. . . .
They were eclipsed by Australian Guarantee’s 20 percent
profit jump to $3,056,424 from a sl6m. gain in receiv-
ables, now s2Bsm.
Some other large companies could not present such
a flourish . . . Commonwealth Industrial Gases’ Decem-
ber quarter sales look “encouraging,” ahead of the
1965 period yet “not quite up to estimates” . . . Carpet
group Minster has endured lower sales and profits; the
10 percent interim is unaffected . . . The year ended
September last saw Henry Jones drop earnings from
$1,675,800 to $1,619,200, the fourth successive retreat;
dividend had already been lifted from 10 to 12 percent
... In six months to September, Permewan Wright
earned 23.8 percent less, at $491,162, on better turnover
and lower tax . . . Cox Bros, directors have “no idea
what the future held for the company” . . . Cheerful-
ness, as generally, broke in with G. J. Coles, where

Some Shop-talk: Second-hand
By CROESUS
FOR some grass-roots economics try
traders in second-hand goods.
They’re a clued-up lot. When one
of the three of them still trading on the
western side of Russell Street (there
used to be 30 of them there) said there
were far too many retail outlets in Aus-
tralia and that much of the labor tied
up in them could be more productively
employed elsewhere in the economy, I
pricked up my ears. He wasn’t neces-
sarily just talking his own book, because
the second-hand trade is a special case.
When explaining why it was not what
it used to be “in Dad’s day,” he said
it had been killed by full employment
and the affluent society. Nowadays, few
people need to pawn and most want
their goods spanking new. At least along
one stretch of Russell Street full em-
ployment is obviously a mixed blessing.
This trader had some other provoca-
tive thoughts worth retailing here as
well. One of his second-hand mates had
just been in America and was surprised
to discover that, except in the motor
business, trade-ins and big mark-ups
played little part in proceedings. Mark-
ups being small in the U.S., people
could buy new goods closer to cost price
than we can, so they were far happier
than here to throw their used ones
away. Although compared to Australia
retail traders in America worked on
very low mark-ups, they were compen-
sated by bigger turnovers and these in
turn benefited manufacturers.
S°> in his view, as well as having too
many shops here, because of their
small turnovers the labor in them was
under-employed. Also, our manufac-
turers suffered from an insufficiency of
orders, a fact most evident now with
much factory capacity not being used.
While they could look, but not all that
hopefully, to export sales to take up the
slack in their capacity, our trading prac-
tices would seem to inhibit them from
developing the home market’s full
potential.
This is a fascinating area for thought
and research. Since the spending spree
ended here in 1960, our internal trad-
ing paths have become encumbered by
practices which, though belying the
whole philosophy of the Trade Practices
Act, are the result of too much
competition.
One concrete example will make the
point. Recently a Melbourne manufac-
turer of record players, anxious to keep
his factory going, offered 1000 machines
to a small retailer at $25 each provided
he took them all. The . quantity was too
big for the retailer, so he made an offer
to take 100 at the same price with the
intention of hawking what he didn’t
want to other small retailers. This offer
was refused and eventually the manu-
facturer got a big store to take the lot,
but, alas, at only $l6 a machine. The
big store sold them at about $25 apiece
(giving it its accustomed percentage
mark-up), but finding them on sale at
this price at which he had made his
offer for 100, the small retailer bought
all he wanted and, being out of town,
sold them off at a sufficient price to
give him the mark-up he was originally
looking for. As he put it to me, the
manufacturer has obviously booked
himself space in Dun & Bradstreet.
Leaving aside competition among
local manufacturers for the limited
home market (shared with importers,
of course), let us look at the suggestion
that the retail trade is overcrowded as
seen against the size of the market.
Are there too many shops and too many
assistants in them? To get the right
answers to these two questions, impres-
sions gained from general observations
could be deceptive. Anyone can see that
you can’t swing a cat in Myers and
can hear a pin drop in countless small
shops throughout the country most
times of the day, and that wherever
you go a milk bar is likely to be either
fore or aft of you. But who is to say we
should have bigger Myer Emporiums
and fewer little shops and milk bars,
that it all should be rationalised to con-
form to a more sensible economic
pattern?
A rapidly growing population puts
pressure on existing shopping facilities.
Suburbia extends its frontiers. Little
nests of shops spring up near practically
every big housing development or ex-
tension away from established shopping
areas. City stores have long been in-
vading suburbia. The pattern of shop-
ping is changing as significantly as its
geographical distribution. Variations in
numbers of shops would be a much less
reliable guide to the availability of
shopping facilities than those in num-
bers employed in retail trade. Maybe
we should discount popular conceptions
of there being a superfluity of shopping
facilities until we are more certain of
what their optimum level should be.
Going into the statistics, I’m afraid
the only up-to-date figures are for the
total numbers employed in retail trade.
The monthly figures compiled by the
Ministry of Labor show a rise of 7300 to
400,700 in the year to June last, which
was slightly less than the average, but
by no means “even” increase of 11,100
a year since 1959 (in 1959-60, 1962-63,
and 1963-64, years of more active busi-
ness, the average increase was much
higher; in 1960-61 and 1961-62, rela-
tively poor years, it was much lower).
To get a better measure, taking the
MOL’S crude figures, the increase in
employment in retail trade last year
accounted for 7.6 percent of the increase
in the total employed work force over
the period. This compares with about
8 percent for manufacturing, 12 percent
for building, and 43 percent for public
sector employment. The latter certainly
had a wide edge, but as the MOL
figures for retail trade exclude hotels,
cafes, and amusements, at least it looks
as if (on the wider definition) retail
trade employment increased more than
manufacturing.
This is admittedly a sketchy analysis
of these figures, but all space allows
here. Passing now to the details of
how this, retail labor is distributed be-
tween the various shop categories, I’m
afraid the latest official statistics, those
gathered in a census taken in 1961, are
more than five years out of date. This
rather dampens one’s enthusiasm to
delve into them. However, it is of pass-
ing interest that a comparison between
the breakdown of that year and the
1954 census figures reveals that the big-
gest jump in retail employment took
place in electrical appliance shops; per-
centage-wise this was more than double
that in any other major shop category,
The only trade it failed to beat was the
combination of motor vehicle, petrol,
and related establishments, which put
on 50 percent more labor compared to
43 percent by electrical appliances.
Surely it would be well worth while for
the authorities to hold such censuses
more frequently. One would now be
only guessing as to whether the 1954-61
trends persisted to 1967.
{JOMING to the official figures for
members of retail establishments, we
are even more in the dark because there
is not even an up-to-date round total
such as is provided for labor employed
in retail trade. The only information
available is the 1962 census. However,
this is so interesting that I can’t wait
until the next census is taken. I’m told
by the MOL this will be this year or
next. Meantime, as to the total number
of retail establishments, we know
officially that between the censuses of
1953 and 1957 it rose by 7375 and in
the next five by only 1980, a slow-down
for which the explanation is most com-
plex. But what has happened since?
Next year’s census will tell us.
Anyway, whether we are over-
shopped or not, those interested in this:
subject will find a detailed perusal of
the last census figures rewarding. As a
sample, we had 40 percent more milk
bars in 1962 than 1954 and that was
long after Sir Douglas Copland dubbed
us a milk-bar economy. How many
have we got now, I wonder!


"THE ECONOMIST" LOOKS AT AUSTRALIA
Leaving the Economy to Itself
This article, which shows a British
view of the Australian economy, is
reproduced from a special supple-
ment on Australia in the current
issue of “The Economist.”
Management of the economy
nowadays is a serious affair for
the Australian authorities, though
they contrive ut without any apparatus
of planning or of formal counsels of
economic advice. It was often com-
plained of Sir Robert Menzies that he
left the economy to itself and to the
Treasurer, who bas now succeeded him,
and of Mr. Holt that he did what the
Treasury and the Reserve Bank (when
they themselves agreed) told him. Will
Mr. Holt as Prime Minister come to
. take a more interventionist line in
economic policy than Sir Robert? Most
Australians do not credit him with any
such urge. Some say that he was too
well trained by Sir Robert in laisser-
faire. He is fair-minded, unpolemic,
honorable and just a little dull, by
contrast.
Other Australians sigh for two terms
of Labor administration by which they
mean not poor Mr. Calwell or even
Mr. Whitlam, but are harking back to
Mr. Chifley, the ideas of development
that brought about the Snowy Moun-
tains Scheme, and the “growth boys”
with whom he surrounded himself. But
the first need is to get a Labor Oppos-
ition capable of presenting itself to the
electorate as an alternative govern-
ment. At least in the way they recently
voted, Australians were not expressing
dissatisfaction with anybody’s economic
policy, unless it was Mr. Calwell’s.
'J'HERE is considerable disappoint-
ment that the 4| percent growth in
Australia’s gross national product in
1965-66 was almost wholly a reflection
of prices and meant very little in real
terms. Where are the 6 percent real
growth rates of the three previous
years? Why has the Australian consumer
ceased to buy on the former scale and
now seems to save like mad? Drought
has been one powerful check to eco-
nomic advance; when rural incomes
fall 25 percent or more, as they did
last season, the effects pervade consumer
durables, cars and farm equipment busi-
ness. Rains have brought better con-
ditions, dramatically better in wheat
and, as restocking gets going, potentially
far better in wool and beef. Will this
get retail business expanding again?
Should the new Government give the
economy a shove? Can it still be safely
left to its own devices?
The dilemma is that although un-
employment has never become even
faintly alarming across the nation (1.2
percent at the latest count) in some
industrial situations the rate has been
disagreeably higher; in certain of them
persistent under-use of capacity has
even begun to suggest some structural
difficulty, at least of a temporarily stub-
born kind, before output can be
restored. This could be true of a wide
band of consumer durables, and even
of automobiles if higher rates of
saturation could no longer be achieved
already there is one car to fewer
than three Australians. Consumer
durables may have been oversold in
the period down to 1965-66, partly as
a result of weak instalment financing
and partly because of the wide margin
of spare income from overtime and
women’s work. And somehow there
has not been the same intensity of
demand for them as there was five
years ago. Stimulation at the consumer
end might not, therefore, have a force-
ful effect on replacement demand.
In any case, the natural expansion
of rural incomes in the current year
is bound to help these industries, just
as the contraction last year damaged
them. If farm incomes swing from —25
percent to +25 percent, as may well
happen, there must be an important
pick-up for cars, trucks, and farm
implements. The difficulty which the
Treasury appears to feel is how to
judge “a well-judged measure” of
stimulus. It sees Commonwealth spend-
ing strongly increasing it will be up
10 percent this year, to $A5930
million, which is 28 percent of last
year’s GNP and is well aware of
all the pressure for more funds to be
provided by the Commonwealth to
the States for development and public
investment. GNP was less than 1 per-
cent up in the September quarter com-
pared with June, which is certainly
nothing for Australia to shout about,
but the fact was that wages and
salaries increased during the quarter by
3J percent, as the result of another
basic wage award coming through.
When the Treasury is invited to do
“something” to stimulate the economy,
its instinct is to go mum, simply be-
cause there is always a case before the
Conciliation and Arbitration Commis-
sion either for an increase in basic
wage rates or in margins for skills.
Such cases can always be argued in
terms of a desirable stimulus for con-
sumer demands; the Treasury knows
that they can also work out as a push
toward a higher cost table for the
whole Australian economy.
The Treasury, like everybody else,
has been waiting for the consumer to
reappear. If he had been expected to
stay coy so long, Mr. McMahon’s last
Budget would assuredly have done more
to give the economy a little help, but
hindsight of that kind does not
necessarily justify a March Budget to
“lift the economy” as some industrial
interests have proposed. Meanwhile in
the monetary sphere the Reserve Bank
has been judiciously easing credit to
the banking system, with more money
for term loan funds, even though the
banks were plentifully supplied with
cash, and nudging short and medium
term interest rates downwards.
Growth has indeed been subdued, and
has produced much complaint. But
drought on the scale of the last two
seasons would in earlier times have
set back the economy seriously, not
merely checked it on the way up.
It is an economy, moreover, that is
undergoing rapid and profound changes
of. structure, in which minerals are mak-
ing the big mileage, and challenging
wool, wheat, and meat in the projec-
tions of Australia’s economic future.
Look down the composition of exports
for 1965-66 and iron ore does not
appear. This year it will, doubling
mineral earnings in five years and trebl-
ing them in ten. Certainly, Australian
and political attitudes, still largely
carried on the sheep’s back, will be
powerfully affected when mining income
comes to challenge rural incomes. There
will be no drought risk for minerals,
but there will be external economic risks
if Japan, in particular, should ever
suffer a serious check to its growth.
And extensions of extractive industry,
though rewarding to the balance of pay-
ments and a powerful stimulus toward
decentralisation of the economy, are big
employers not of labor so much as of
capital. And the capital, until Australia
is able to generate savings in high
volume (which may be sooner than
most people think) can only come from
abroad.
B Y strokes of clever timing, on the
part of British capital transferring
itself before the Chancellor closed the
door, and on the part of Australian
borrowers ducking under the U.S.
Treasury’s wire, Australia has so far
suffered no significant adverse effects
from controls on capital exports from
its principal suppliers. In 1965-66 the
capital account brought in SAB39 mil-
lion, not far short of twice the rate of
the two previous years. The current
year’s inflow is bound to be less, be-
cause of British and American restraints,
and also because of the need to absorb
last year’s abundant flow. Imports have
been running high, above the $2BOO
million mark in 1965-66, and are not
likely to fall much. But exports, assisted
by new mineral exports and good wheat
business, should be within SA2OO million
of imports. If invisible items cost about
SA6OO million as last year, the result
would be a fall in the reserves of
SAIOO million.
It may be true that Australia needs
a higher average level of reserves than
most countries, because of wider fluc-
tuations in export prices and the un-
certainties of the seasons. At around
SAI3OO million, they represent six
months’ imports, which certainly gives
room for using them when the balance
of payments moves adversely. But Aus-
tralians are not neurotic either about
the balance of payments or about the
size of the reserves.

Guidance from the interims
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
IF the experience of the last week or
so is any guide, industrial share
prices could be in for a little
downward adjustment during the in-
terim report season that is now well
and truly under way. True, the share
price index could well remain high as
BHP makes its oily presence felt. But
the market, as a whole, has shown no
real signs of being enthused about the
good interim reports that have come
out (and there have been some remark-
ably good ones in the circumstances),
while it has been quite prepared to take
immediate downward action in those
cases where the reports have failed to
please.
Unfortunately, there could be quite a
few companies which could find their
interim reports getting a fairly cold
reception, particularly if the unimpres-
sive forecasts at the annual meetings
last year are borne out. So far, glum
reports have brought a poor response:
Permewan Wright’s profit figures
brought an immediate drop of 10 cents
to 90 cents, which is too low for this
country merchant in view of its recovery
prospects now the drought is over;
Henry Jones dipped sharply after the
profit did likewise; Associated Pulp
looks to be fair buying now that it has
revealed the extent of the horror of the
latest six months.
But in view of the very likely pros-
pect that industrial share prices could
well be considerably higher by the end
of the year, it is among the companies
that have come out with quite good
interim results that some of the best
buying opportunities seem to remain at
present. For instance, last week’s ex-
cellent results from the hire-purchase
companies Associated Securities and
Custom Credit and Australian Guaran-
tees’ distinguished advance in both pro-
and outstandings (which followed
ab . out 12 r mo^ hs steady support from
tbls P a S e for hire-purchase stocks) mdi-
cates that this industry is going through
a S? ob * ta f e . bes P lte tbe intrusion of
for f § n banking groups and of motor
makers carrying their own finance.
A MONG the good iriterim results
jLjL that the market has failed to re-
spond to adequately are Ralph
McKay (whose stake in the farm
equipment business, mainly as the
maker of discs for ploughs, should
bring it a significant recovery this year),
G. J. Coles, and ACI a company
whose share price is still suffering from
the uncertainty over the future of the
3.3 million shares held by F. W. Wil-
liams (which is now on its way into the
Pioneer Concrete empire).
APART from ACI, which has a big
stake in packaging among its
many interests, there are excellent
buying opportunities still in the packag-
ing industry, an old favorite here, par-
ticularly since APM’s interim report
indicated that production of packaging
board was well up. So the packaging
industry must be doing more business,
too. APM’s interim, with its sizable-
profit rise appearing to be due only to
a sharp cut in tax, was much better than
the market gave the company credit
for; a concentration on its pre-tax
profit drop of million misses the
point that APM has hived of many
activities into half-owned companies
from which it only draws dividends and
does not consolidate profits. In addi-
tion, it received some tax benefits from
its new plant installations that should
contribute more in the second half of
the year, once their teething troubles are
over, than in the first half (particularly
the new Spearwood mill in W.A.).
THE market should not get too sad
about the poor performance of As-
sociated Pulp, either. The main
reason its half-year profit was cut in
half (and its dividend clipped % per-
cent) was that fine paper production
had been cut considerably at one stage
last year, but is now back at capacity
and orders are high. And, in any event,
the December half year of 1965, with,
which the latest result is being com-
pared, wis unusually good because of
the demands of decimal currency con-
version. With higher prices, higher pro-
duction, and better sales the company
should be able to restore its earnings
for the full year at least to the 1964-65
level of 11 percent on capital (from
which that year it paid 9 percent).
Most of the paper merchants should
also suffer some profit fall in the first
half of 1966-67, but do better in the
second half, so there could be some-
good buying opportunities if they fall
too low on gloomy interims. In any
event, Associated Pulp’s separation of
its hardboard operations into a jointly
owned subsidiary with CSR will give
its accounts a different look (although
it seems that its Burnie-board had been
coming under a lot of competitive pres-
sure from APM-CSR’s Pyneboard).
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS holding EXOIL N.L. could be well rewarded for their patience.
The chart, which has been reproduced back to 1963, shows a clear break of
trend at the beginning of 1965, after which a strong downward trend commenced
and continued until a low point of 9c was recorded early 1966. A rise to 20c
followed the general uptrend of the oil index and the stock reacted back to 10c in
October of last year. The current rise to 19c on high volume would be considered
a penetration of the major downtrend and a short-term rise to 20c is indicated
with a further target of 25 c, where fairly strong resistance would be encountered
from the range of trading which took place in that area late 1965. An overall
base projection for the longer term would take prices back to approximately the
54c level. Last sale price on 27/1/67 —17 c.

A Pair of Retail Leaders
By PELIAS in Melbourne
RETAIL trading appears to be
looking up, so the time may be
ripe for an investment in two of
the Melbourne leaders, Myers and
McEwans. Myers best suits the investor
wishing to salt his money away safely
for a year or so, while McEwans ap-
pears likely to provide earlier gains.
This company’s new hardware store in
Bourke Street has apparently been more
than successful and the success should
be reflected in the current year’s profit
figures. Over the past two years, estab-
lishment expenses at the new store, at
an average $70,000 odd anually, have
kept net profit at around the $33,000
mark.
Another factor has been the loss of
a Canberra subsidiary the shop has
now been closed and consolidated with
the main Canberra branch. So the cur-
rent year should see a resurgence of the
profit growth which shareholders had
become used to prior to the past two
years. This resurgence will be added to
by results from new stores. Like Myers,
McEwans chooses not to complain about
the problems of city trading and instead
spreads its tentacles to the suburbs,
where most of the growth lies. In the
first half of the current year, stores
were opened at Camberwell, North-
lands, ahd Footscray.
'J'HE company has already forecast
an increased profit for the year, so
there should be little danger in buying
the shares at their present $1.83. This
yields an attractive 5.5 percent from
the 10 percent dividend, which was
covered one-and-a-half times by 1965-
66 earnings. It will probably see a
double cover this year. There is plenty
of room for improvement in the share
price. The 1966 peak was $2.05.
Benefits are unlikely to come as
quickly from Myers, because the cur-
rent price of $3.09 yields a meagre
2.8 percent from the percent divi-
dend. Nevertheless; there is still plenty
of room for an improvement in the
share price. The 1966 peak was $3.55
and the 40.8 percent return on capital
in the 1965-66 term is sure to be im-
proved on in the current year. Sales
were 6.9 percent higher in the first
three months, including turnovers from
the new stores at Northlands and Bur-
wood (N.S.W.). In the full 1965-66
term, sales rose by only 2.3 percent and
higher costs eroded profits to 4.9 per-
cent below the previous year.
The extensive dividend cover and the
enlargement which it should see with
the opening of further stores in the next
two years make the likelihood of a
dividend increase during that period
very real. As the payout is already high,
an alternative could well be to lower it
(percentage-wise) through a cash issue
to shareholders. With the expansion the
group is planning, the cash could be
put to excellent use. Whatever course,
shareholders stand to gain. The com-
pany has not made a cash issue for
years. The last issue of any description
was a one-for-two bonus in 1961.
Two things holding demand for the
shares back at the moment are the
threat of a more aggressive competitor
when the Cox group’s Foys store up
Bourke Street is sold and the doubts
which are held of late over that disease
among retailers, bad debts. In fact,
neither of these should be worrying
points. Myer executives would welcome
a real competitor in their domain. They
believe this is exactly what trading in
the city needs and are sure that the
increased business which such compe-
tition would bring to the area would
leave Myers with greater turnovers than
they chalk up now. Probably they are
right.
As far as bad debts are concerned,
any account customer would assure one
that the methods of collection are highly
successful. Apart from this, the group’s
accounting outlook on debtors can only
be described as too conservative. Ac-
counts are written off the moment they
are considered doubtful, and gross book
debts reflect only those balances con-
sidered collectable in full. Over and
above this, a doubtful debts provision is
charged against profits every year. Nor-
mally, this provision is not drawn on—
as a result, it equalled $3.3 million or
10 percent of accounts receivable at
last balance date. >>,■,
So, for the investor after long-term
gains and those seeking a safe plaqe,
for their money over the next year or
so, Myers looks better than it ever has
before.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Some Thoughts on "Leaders"
THE last series of articles was about
some “leaders” that seemed to
have fallen from favor in that
there had ben a sharp drop in the
market price. The companies which
were reviewed were all relatively well
known, but some people might have
disputed whether they were, in fact,
“leaders.” I have never been very
clear about the precise definition of a
“leader.” Like many others, I had heard
the saying “They are the stocks which
lead the market up and down.” There
might have been some excuse for
thinking that they were the stocks
which were most actively traded on
the Stock Exchange, for at one time
the No. 1 post on the Sydney Stock
Exchange seemed to be the “leaders’ ”
post.
The problem has, however, been
solved so far as I am concerned. The
“leaders” are now those stocks which
are included in the Melbourne 50
Leaders Index. The Sydney Stock
Exchange might well disagree with
certain selections, but, by and large, the
list is probably fairly representative of
the stocks which most investors would
have in mind when they talk of
leaders.
there was any suggestion
that the companies concerned were
“leaders” in their particular indus-
tries, I do not know. If there was any
such suggestion, then it would be in-
teresting to examine closely those
companies whose shares were showing
high dividend yields at the present
time. The average dividend yield
from this group of fifty companies was
about 5J percent at the time of writing,
yet seventeen companies had dividend
yields in excess of this figure.
I have not considered the situation
on the basis of earnings yields, because
I believe that “earnings” are often a
matter of opinion so far as security
analysts are concerned. At this stage
of my own development, I am not
prepared to say what is the “right”
figure nor to suggest that any other
figure is necessarily wrong.
The five companies which I have
now selected for study all have
dividend yields in excess of 6 percent,
but I have excluded two where the
dividend yield is in excess of 10 percent
on the basis that the market is rarely
very wrong and these shares must there-
fore be considered rather speculative.
The companies which I have selected
are: Associated Pulp & Paper Mills,
Clyde Industries, Email, Olympic Con-
solidated, and H. C. Sleigh.
The record, on my basis of compu-
tation, of each company is as follows:
Earnings per share (cents)
Year ended in 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
APPM 5.6 12.2 11.2 9.6 14.2
Clyde 7.4 8.2 9.4 11.0 8.8
Email 4.7 5.6 5.5 5.3 3.2
Olympic 10.4 10.8 9.3 9.6 6.7
H. C. Sleigh 6.6 6.3 5.2 5.8 5.0
These figures are based on net profit
before tax and tax has been deducted
at the full company rate to arrive at
the absolute figure. This means that no
account is taken of any continuing or
non-recurring benefits which produce a
lower tax liability. Other adjustments
have been made in respect of several
types of provision which seem to be
more in the nature of reserves, in that
they are not drawn upon apparently
in the following year to meet the
liability against which the provision was
made.
From the earnings figures, none of the
companies seems to have a very attrac-
tive record, although, until 1965-66,
Clyde Industries was showing quite
good growth in per share earnings of
around 14 percent per annum com-
pound. The sharp decline in 1965-66
points to the problems that face an in-
vestor when he is trying to make in-
vestments for the longer term,
Ideally, the analyst would like to
make his appraisal of a company start-
ing from the trends in that company’s
sales volume and its relationship to the
total market. He would then proceed
along the following lines:
(i) From past trends, assess the likely
future growth in the total demand for
the product.
(ii) Again from past trends, make
some judgment of the trend in the com-
sh|re of that market .
*” (&) Examine trends in the price
whlch has been obtained for the par-
ticu]ar duc , and in tQ

there s should be a d thai the
extema , , at least make sorae
judgmen , 0 f possible maximum and
J min B imum leve f s of sales value the

v , u : . .... , ~
from this point, estimations further
become extremely difficult, because it
../ . „
is necessary to try to estimate future
. , . 7 x 7 , j ti-
trends m costs. In broad outline, esti-
■ , .
mates of raw material costs, labor costs,
, t ’
and selling and administration costs are
° , ,r , , j
necessar yi Jo be effective, each broad

.Finally, some judgment must be made
of , “‘“ r . e fi ? an< ; ln « needs according to
Pf°*iction levels and then of the most

could have SOlne considerable bearing
on future earn,n S s P« share-
I n case °f “single product” com-
panies, some such estimates are some-
times possible on the basis of fixing
maximum and minimum levels for
future profits. In this case, “single pro-
, „ r 5 r ,
duct need not necessarily mean that the
, , 7
company produces only one item; it
could also include companies where a
number of related products are pro-
duced, but in the main the demand for
them varies in the same proportion.
However, there are many groups where
activities have been very diversified and
such estimations as have been described
would be quite impossible. In most
such cases, diversification means that
growth is restricted in much the
same way as the growth of a very diver-
sified investment portfolio is restricted
so it is often possible to make some
sort of estimate of profit in the very
short term by reference to the trends
in the return on investment. This form
of “forecasting” rests on the assumption
that the company will try, in the course
of its diversification program, to earn
at a predetermined rate on funds in-
vested.
Even when an estimate of future
earnings has been made, it is still neces-
sary to make some estimate of likely
trends in dividends per share. In the
case of the five companies selected, past
trends have been as follows:
Year ended in 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
APPM 6.0 10.0 9 0 9 0 9 5
Clyde 7.5 7.5 7 5 7 5 7.5
Email 5.0 5 0 5 0 5.0 3.0
Olympic 4.8 4 8 4 8 4 8 5 0
H. C. Sleigh 6.2 6.2 5.6 5.0 5.0
The analyst’s task is then not an
easy one if he refuses to accept the
proposition that a straight line pro-
jection of per share earnings is ade-
quate. Futhermore, he is still faced
with the problem that he may predict
earnings and dividends with reasonable
accuracy and still find that the market
does not accept the same price-
earnings multiple or dividend yield any
more. It may well be that the chart-
ists are better able to judge future
market movements. It would be inter-
esting to see whether they are pre-
pared to forecast prices of any parti-
cular stock, say, twelve months hence.
The dividend yields available on
these stocks vary from 6.3 percent in
the case of APPM to 8.9 percent for
H. C. Sleigh. So they are attractive
for yield alone. Because of their former
status, any improvement in earnings
per share is likely to revive interest
and consequently raise the market price.
These aspects will be examined for each
company individually over the next
five weeks.

MINING
A New Swing to Uranium
IF one were to look for a year to
nominate as the zenith of the
uranium prospecting boom of the
mid-19505, 1954 appears the obvious
choice. In that year the Sydney Stock
Exchange published a guide to ura-
nium prospecting companies. Indeed,
many were called but few chosen and
by 1959 only a few such companies
were left in existence. Fewer still
achieved success and of these only two,
Mary Kathleen Uranium and United
Uranium, remain in existence; some
other companies survived but have no
longer any interest in uranium. Such
companies include North Australian
Uranium Corporation N.L., Uranium
Development and Prospecting N.L.,
Uranium Consolidated N.L., and
Uranium Holdings N.L.
In 1956 the Commonwealth Govern-
ment approved the contract between the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority and Mary Kathleen Uranium
for the supply of 4500 tons of uranium
oxide and by 1958 United Uranium
and South Alligator Uranium had both
small contracts with the same
Authority. Profits began to flow fairly
soon and in 1959 Mary Kathleen Ura-
nium paid its first dividend. No doubt
influenced by this, Kathleen Invest-
ments (Australia) Limited, which then
owned a 35 percent interest in Mary
Kathleen, acquired its own uranium
deposits, Anderson’s Lode and the
Skal Lease. Dividends were forth-
coming from South Alligator Uranium
and United Uranium in the following
year.
Considering the rapid growth in
the development of uranium resources
it is not surprising in hindsight that
demand for the mineral dried up al-
most overnight. The 1960 report of the
Australian Atomic Energy Commission
pointed out that world productive cap-
acity had trebled since 1956 but no
increase in demand could be expected
until after 1970. In the same year the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority withdrew its offer, which had
been standing since 1957, to the then
colonial territories of Kenya, Uganda,
Tanganyika, and Swaziland, for the
purchase of uranium, and also with-
drew from an agreement with the
New Zealand Government to investi-
gate that country’s uranium resources.
The year 1964 saw the completion
of the remaining Australian contracts
with overseas consumers. The Federal
Government completed its ten-year
contract to supply the joint Anglo-
American uranium purchasing agency
with 3,000,0001 b. of uranium oxide.
Mary Kathleen completed its final ship-
ment under contract to the UKAEA
and placed its mine and plant on a
care and maintenance basis after hav-
ing earned sufficient profits to pay
ordinary dividends totalling $3.98 over
the years since 1959. In September of
the same year, United Uranium also
completed shipments under its contract
to the UKAEA; profits earned from
this contract allowed the company to
pay dividends totalling 95 cents in the
years 1960-65.
A year later, in 1965, the pendulum
had started to swing very strongly in
the other direction. Negotiations be-
tween the French Government and
Canadian producers took place for the
supply of substantial quantities of
uranium ore and, even though Canada
has about one third of total world
reserves, Denison Mining, the Canadian
company involved, deemed it wise to
send representatives to Australia seeking
avenues of extending its own ore
reserves in the event that it received
a large contract from France. Sir
Harold Raggat reported to the Aus-
tralian Atomic Energy Commission
that there would be a substantial
shortfall in the supply of uranium to
meet demand between 1975-1980 on
the production potential of known de-
posits.
RECENTLY, the Japanese Atomic
Fuel Corporation survey team
arrived in Australia and is currently
studying this country’s availability of
nuclear fuel. The leader of this team,
Dr. Kamiyama, has said that Japan’s
supplies of uranium will run out before
1975 and it is therefore essential to
open up new sources of supply as the
development of mining operations will
take from 7 to 8 years.
Naturally, interest is at a very high
pitch in the only listed companies
with uranium deposits United
Uranium, Mary Kathleen Uranium
and Kathleen Investments. On com-
pletion of its original contract, Mary
Kathleen Uranium had proved reserves
of 7670 tons of uranium oxide the
original contract was for 4500 tons.
As Mary Kathleen had financed its
plant from redeemable preference
shares and loans, all of which were
repaid during the life of the original
contract, it is in an extremely advan-
tageous position as regards the price
at which it can offer supplies. However,
with the situation rapidly turning into
a sellers’ market, it is unlikely that
Mary Kathleen would be prepared to
start selling at relatively low prices
now and forego the higher prices it can
expect to receive in a few years’ time.
In addition to Mary Kathleen’s 7670
tons, Kathleen Investments has so far
proved up about 2300 tons of uranium
oxide on its Anderson’s Lode and about
600 tons on the Skal lease, but both
of these have yet to be fully drilled.
Kathleen Investments, of course, has
no plant at these deposits, both of which
are underground operations which
would require considerable funds to be
developed quickly. United Uranium has
perhaps 500 tons of ore proved up,
making a total of some 11,000 tons. The
Commonwealth Government’s holdings
at Radium Hill and Rum Jungle would
add to this figure, but total reserves
proved at present are still very modest
when compared to Canada and the
U.S., which together would have over
a million tons of high-grade ore. Never-
theless, a country like Japan, which
is looking for quantities of 100,000 tons
by 1985, could well find Australia a
useful source of supply, and the odds
are very favorable for those prepared to
pay the price.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
In somewhat variable overall dealings there have been quite
a few distinctive price variations based largely on the interpreta-
tion of company reports. Henry Jones, for example, was cut
back 35 cents to $3.75, while Rothmans, on news of executive
changes, slipped 10 cents to $2.40. Macßobertson also suffered
on its interim, losing 21 cents to finish at $1.15. Thiess, on
brilliant coal prospects, added 17 cents, reaching $1.40. Un-
certainty among retailers affected Myer (down 5 cents to $3.05)
and Grace Bros, (down 12 cents to $1.60). Hire-purchase issues,
despite excellent results, have been treated carefully.

Chess Bulletin
KARLIS OZOLS
Australian chess Master
Karlis Ozols has defeated
Emanuel Basta in the
play-off for the 1966 Victorian
Championship.
Ozols was born in Riga, capital
of Latvia, in 1912 and migrated
to Australia in 1949. He decis-
ively won the Victorian Cham-
pionship that year and has won
it six times since, in 1951, 1953,
1954, 1962, 1964, and 1966. This is
the second occasion on which
thei'e has been a Basta-Ozols
play-off for the title, Basta win-
ning in 1960 with a score of
s±-4±.
Ozols’ success story is not con-
fined to State championships,
howeveh He was joint Champion
of Australia with S. Lazare in
1957 and in the Melbourne
Pietzcker (Australian Open) he
gained first placings in 1949-50
and 1951-52, and tied for first in
1953-54 with another ex-Latvian,
A. Teters. Tetters incidentally was
the previous (1965) Victorian
champion.
In the zone selection tourna-
ment of 1963, Ozols was once
again involved in a tie for first
plac'e in an important tourna-
ment. The co-winner on this
occasion was Sydney’s Bela Ber-
ger, who later went to and won
the zonal tournament at
Djakarta.
Here is a Very convincing win
by Ozols in the 1965 Victorian
Championship:
White: K. Ozols
Black: B. Kondra
Opening: Queen’s Indian
I. N-KB3, N-KB3; 2. P-KN 3, P-QN3;
3. B-N2, B-N2; 4. O-O, P-K3;
5. P-QB4, B-K2; 6. N-QB3, O-O;
7. Q-82, P-Q4; 8. N-K5, QN-Q2;
Better here was 8 . . . Q-Bl protect-
ing his fianchettoed Bishop, wnich in
turn was busily guarding the long white
diagonal. Black’s idea of inducing
White to double his centre pawns did
not work out as well as he had hoped.
9. P-Q4, NxN?; 10. PxN, N-N5;
11. PxP!, PxP; 12. Q-85, B-Bl;
Black is in trouble already. The
alternative, 13 . . . Q-Bl; 14. QxQ,
RxQ; allows White to apply embarrass-
ing pressure with 15. B-R3. Also
White’s ‘‘weak” doubled pawn# suddenly
becomes a two-edged sword.
13. Q-84, P-QB3; 14. P-KR3, P-KN 4?;
Whatever chances Black had of sav-
ing the game previously are now dis-
pelled. He has weakened his K-side
beyond repair and his Knight is forced
hither and thither without getting any-
where. Better was N-R3 immediately.
15. Q-Q4, N-R3; 16. P-K4, B-R3;
17. R-Ql, Q-Bl; 18. PxP, N-B4;
19. Q-KN 4, N-R3; 20. Q-R5, N-B4;
21. B-K4
Now Black learns the folly of his
14th move, also the strength of White’s
doubled pawn. Any move by the
Knight at this point leads to its capture
or, worse still, mate.
21 . . . P-R3; 22. P-Q6, BxP;
What else? A piece has to go. If
22 . . . B-Ql; 23. IP-Q7 winning the
Knight or if 22 . . . N-N2; 23. QxRP
and the situation for Black is even
worse.

25. P-Q7, Q-B2; 26. BxQBP, B-N2;
27. N-Q5, Resigns.
There is nothing left. 27 , . . Qxß
of course loses the Queen by a Knight
fork and if 27 . . . Q-Nl; 28. N-K7ch,
K-B2; and Black is entangled in a
pretty mating net after 29. BxP.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Seconds into the Ring
THE kerb exchange made its debut
a few years ago, only to fade very
quickly into obscurity. Now we
have the “Second Exchange” trying to
establish itself. The pian behind it
has already operated in most facets of
the investment industry, with mixed
success. To his credit, he was the
person mainly responsible for introduc-
ing the fascinating subject of technical
analysis into this country. Further-
more, the share option business has
become highly sophisticated under his
guidance.
However, these specialised fields of
investment are a far cry from the com-
plexities of operating a stock market.
If such a market is allowed to develop,
the need for a securities commission
becomes urgent. So far, stock markets
have been competently policed by
stockbroker committees. The cost of
this policing is met by the stock-
brokers themselves and this is one
reason why the second market can
afford to charge half the rate of com-
mission. Those thinking of investing
through the second market should
tread carefully.
My initial move this week was to
buy 400 Pioneer Concrete at $1.14 on
the first market. Temporarily at any
rate, this purchase has the distinction
of being made at the lowest price for
several years. The weakness in the
share price seems to be directly related
to the F. W. Williams takeover. Per-
haps the selling has been caused by
those shareholders who are at a loss to
understand the motive in taking over
F. W. Williams. No clue is given in the
chairman’s address or the annual report.
Looking at it from the other side,
those F. W. Williams shareholders who
have accepted the offer are probably-
resolved to hold on to their Pioneer
Concrete shares. So, now that the
takeover has at last been finalised,
Pioneer Concrete shares are unlikely
to suffer any further battering.
Ignoring F. W. Williams and con-
fining oneself to the financial pro-
gress of Pioneer Concrete, it’s difficult
not to be impressed by the steady rise
in earning rate over the last five years.
Add this to the chairman’s prediction
of higher profits in the current year
and the shares could recover to the
$1.40 mark.
The second purchase of the week was
1000 Longreach Oil at 25 cents. Apart
from Woodside, I’ve steered clear of
the oil market for several months. While
I’ve missed on some good rises (San-
tos up 30 cents last week), I’ve also
avoided some possible losses. But with
1967 looking like the year of the off-
shore well, the oil stocks could steal
the glamor from the mining market.
Longreach manages to scrape into
that select group which can be classified
as “having interests in offshore drilling
areas.” It is one of a syndicate holding
title to a 2750-square-mile area off the
Western Australian coast, just south of
Barrow Island.
The last buying move this week was
to add another 100 King Island
Scheelite to the present holding of 300.
Although the market seems uncertain
after the result, the rising wolfram price
should soon be a dominant factor.
To pay for this week’s purchases I
sold the 400 Mt. Morgan at $3.45. This
sale boosted realised profits for the year
by $175. Mt. Morgan is going to have
an outstanding interim report, but
every man and his dog knows it.
BOUGHT
400 Pioneer Concrete 1.14 $466
1000 Longreach Oil 0.25 $256
100 King Island Scheelite 3.25 $333
SOLD
400 Mt. Morgan 3.45 $1352
The credit balance has built up to
$6OB. The excellent interim report from
G. J. Coles could push the shares up
toward the $1.30 mark —a convenient
exit point. e
