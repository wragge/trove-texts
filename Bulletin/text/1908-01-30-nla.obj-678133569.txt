THE RED PAGE
EARLY VERSE BY THOMAS HARDY
GOD-FORGOTTEN.
I towered far, and lo ! I stood within
The presence of the Lord Most High,
Sent thither by the sons of earth to win
Some answer to their cry.
“ The Earth, sav'st thou ? The Human race ?
By Me created ? Sad its lot ?
Nay ; I have no such place ;
Such world I fashioned not.”
“0 Lord, forgive me when I say B
Thou spak’st the word, and mad st it all.
“ The Earth of men—let Me bethink Me... Y ea—
I dimly do recall
“ Some tiny sphere I framed long back
(Mid millions of such shapes of Mine)
So named ... It perished, surely—not a wrack
Remaining, or a sign ?
“ It lost My interest from the first,
My aims therefor succeeding ill
Haply it died of doing as it durst ? ”
“ Lord, it existeth still.’
“ Dark, then, its life ! For not a cry
Of aught it bears do I now hear ; _
Of its own act the threads wer e snapped whereby
Its plaints had reached mine ear.
“ It used to come for gifts of good,
Till came its severance self-entailed,
When sudden silence on that side ensued,
And has till now prevailed.
“ All other orbs have kept in touch ;
Their voices reach Me speedily ;
Thy people took on them o’er much
In sundering them from Me !
“ And this is strange—though sad enough
Earth’s race should think that One whose call
Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff
Must heed their tainted ball ! . . .
“ But, sav’st thou, ’tis by pangs distraught,
And strife..and silent suffering ?
Deep grieved am I that injury should be wrought
Even on so poor a tiling !
“ Thou should’st have learnt that Not to Mend
For me could mean but Not to Know;
Hence, Messengers ! and straightway put an end
To what men undergo.” . . .
Homing at dawn, I thought to see
One of the Messengers standing by.
Oh, childish thought ! . . . Yet oft it comes to me
When trouble hovers nigh.
NEUTRAL TONES.
We stood by a pond that winter day,
And the sun was white, as though chidden of
God,
And a few leaves lay on the starving sod—
They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.
Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove
Over tedious riddles solved years ago ;
And some words played between us to arid
fro —
On winch lost the more by our love.
The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing
Alive enough to have strength to die ;
Arid a grin of bitterness swept thereby
Like an ommous bird a-wirig.
Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,
And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me
Your face, and the God-cursed sun, and a tree,
And a pond edged with grayish leaves.
AT A LUNAR ECLIPSE.
Thy shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea,
Now steals along upon the Moon’s meek shine
In even monochrome and curving line
Of imperturbable serenity.
How shall I link such symmetry
With the torn troubled form I know as thine,
That profile, placid as a brow divine,
With continents of moil and misery ?
And can immense Mortality but throw
So small a shade, and Heaven’s high human
scheme
Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies ?
Is such the stel'ar gauge of earthly show,
Nation at war with nation, brains that teem,
Heroes, and women fairer than the skies ?
I LOOK INTO MY GLASS.
1 look into my glass,
And view my wasting skin,
And say, “ Would God it came to pass
My heart had shrunk as tiiiu ! ”
For then, I, undistrest
V By hearts grown cold to me,
Could lonely wait my endless rest
With equanimity.
But Time, to make me grieve,
Part steals, lets part abide ;
And shakes this fragile frame at eve
With throbbings of noontide.
THE RUINED MAID.
“ O, Melia, my dear, this does everything crown !
Who could have supposed 1 should meet you in
town ?
And whence such fair garments, such pros-
peri-tv?”
“ O, didn’t you know I’d been ruined ? ” said she.
“You left us in tatters, without shoes or socks,
Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks ;
And now you’ve gay bracelets, and bright feathers
three 1
“Yes; that’s how we dress when we’re ruined,”
said she.
“At home in the barton you said ‘ thee ’ and
► ‘thou,’
And ‘thic oon,’ and ‘thas oon,’'and ‘t’other’;
but now
I Your talking quite fits ’ee for high cqmpa-ny ! ’
“ Some polish is gained with one’s ruin,” said she.
“ Your hands were like paws then, your face blue
and bleak.
But. now I’m bewitched by your delicate cheek.
And your little gloves fit on as any la dy ! ”
“ We never do work when we re ruined,” said she.
“ You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream,
And you’d sigh, and you’d sulk ; but at present
you seem
To know not of megrims or melancho-ly ! ”
“ True. There’s an advantage in ruin, ’ said she.
“ I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown,
And a delicate face, and could strut about town !
“My dear—a raw country girl, such as you be,
Isn't equal to that. You ain’t ruined,” said she.
{From “ Wessex Poems ” and “Poems of the Past
and Present ’’ (Harpkk’s).]
A PROFISSIONAL LOVER
!_TAVING disposed of the lovers of
~| Madame de Stael, Francis
Gribble has turned his gun on
;ger game. And the quarry is easy to
d in George Sand and Her Lovers
ell). For George Sand might almost
termed a professional lover; her busi-
ss was wholesale, her lovers in
mber a football team, and all of them
e4'ul as literary “copy.”
In an interesting preface Gribble an-
gers the question why French literary
r es are interesting and English literary
ms dull. His explanation is that there
a difference between the attitudes
lich representative men and women of
e two races respectively adopt toward
eir own personalities. In England
e tone —set by the public schools and
diversities—is one of reticence, self-
•ntrol, shame-faced ness in the presence
strong emotions, and a grim regard for
ie conventionalities. The Englishman’s
übition is to be like other Englishmen ;
3 aims to succeed upon approved lines,
irefully conforming to a recognised type,
.s Gribble acutely says :
The man who diverges, however brilli-
ltly, from the type, is not only mistrusted
y his neighbors, but is apt to mistrust
imself.
The theme might be developed. One
mglishman is not only like another
mglishman, but he is the other English-
man. And he has but one god, and his
ame is Good Form. In Oxford not
idy may a man pot wear a scarlet tie,
ut by the rime he has reached Oxford
e has been so emptied of individuality
hat he does not crave to wear a scarlet
ie. It would differentiate him from the
Irowd. It is a nice crowd, of course,
iut still it is the Crowd—and he would
eel lonely outside. His ideals are a
mudge of negatives, “ the things that
10 fellow would do”; and the wiping
iut, of all idiosyncrasies from his
lothes is merely a sign of the
ack of individuality in his blank
ace and his blanker soul. His emo-
ions are as limited as his voca-
mlary. The modern literature and
Intma of England shows us the English-
nan’sflounderings when guilty of emotion,
lis strenuous efforts to keep himself a
stone, his utter inability to express him-
self in a language he has deliberately for-
gotten. And it is interesting to recall,
is showing how little facial heredity
mounts when a nation is left too long by
tself to in-breed, that this inconspicu-
ously attired, carefully-dusted young man
with a Spring-cleaned soul, with his con-
tempt for emotion, and inability to feel,
is the direct descendent of the flaunting,
egotistic Elizabethans, the roisterers of
the Mermaid, the dare-devil buccaneers
of the Spanish Main.
ess?
To get back to the remarkable soul of
George Sand. Gribble points out that,
though it is not to be supposed that as
far as actual conduct goes the English
are more austere than their qeighbors,
the Englishwoman imfuses to regard
love seriously where the relations of the
lovers are “ irregular.” What the
Frenchman regards as a romance, the
Englishman regards as an intrigue. This
special English brand of hypocrisy, im-
ported with many other English products
to Australia, is exemp.itied for the
European peoples by the case of George
Eliot.
What is incomprehensible to them is her
yearning for the reputation of “respecta-
bility,” and her calm assurance that she
could achieve it by assuming a name to
which another woman was legally entitled.
For she was not Mrs. Lewes ; and everybody
knew that she was not Mrs. Lewes ; and yet
all her friends and acquaintances agreed to
pretend that she was, and would assuredly
have refused to visit her if, while living with
Lewes, she had continued to call herselt
Mary’Anne Evans.
But the Frenchman errs in the oppo-
site direction ; he aims to raise intrigue
to the dignity of romance. Victor Hugo,
Alfred de Vigny, Chateaubriand, ail
exalted their mistresses in their writings,
while George Sand made a business of it.
As Gribble says, her feeling apparently
was that, when she loved, she was
making history, and she took pains that
the future historian should not find the-
records incomplete. She told everybody,
and wrote further details to everybody
else, and then put her successive lovers
into books. Certainly George Sand
carried out the traditions of her extra-
ordinary descent. She was the child of
kings and of daughters of the people. Her
great-great-grandfather was the Elector
Frederick Augustus of Saxony, whom his
dutiful descendent described as “the
most amazing debauchee ” of his epoch.
From one of his many mistresses, through
a line of descendents and their mistresses,
George Sand was born, though it must,
in fairness, be stated that her fathei,
who was an aide-de-camp to Murat, had,
rather tardily, married the grisette with
an extremely particolored “ past ” who
was her mother. At the age of three,
Auroi’e Dupia, which was George Sand s
name, already wore breeches—and she
continued to wear them at intervals all
through her life. She was married early
to a fool who was also a sot. Then the
artistic temperament of the wife de-
veloped, and separation was inevitable.
And, going off to Paris, the mother of
two children, she dressed herself like a
man, and took to smoking long cigars.
Her first lover was a literary man named
Jules Sandeau, with whom she collabo-
rated. She wrote enthusiastically of illicit
love—hers was the first shrill feminine
note in fiction—-and found a public atten-
tively listening. Her next lover was
Prosper Merimee, but the affair did not
last a week. Then came the affair of
the poet Alfred de Musset, afterwards
utilised by her for “copy” in Elle et Lui ,
and, by Musset’s brother, in Lui et Elle.
For George Sand turned everything
into “copy”; “she yielded ‘ copy ’ as
regularly as a cow yields milk.” She
worked eight hours a day on an average,
and sometimes wrote for thirteen hours
at a stretch. But Musset fell ill in
Venice—it is said, of delirium tremens—
and George Sand transferred her
tremendous affections to the handsome
Italian doctor, Pagello, whom she had
summoned to attend to Musset's ravings.
Here is her written declaration of love :
Perhaps you think that you do not know
me—and that I do not know you. lam
ignorant of your past life, and of your
character, and of what the men who do know
you think of you. Perhaps you are the best
of men ; perhaps the worst. I love you
without knowing whether I shall be able to
respect you. I love you because I feel drawn
to you, and it is quite possible that I shall
soon be compelled to hate you. . . . Vou
will make no empty ' promises, and
swear no false oaths. You will love
me, according to your rights, as best
you can. ... Do not learn my language,
and I will not seek in yours for the words
which might tell you of my doubts and fears.
I am willing to be ignorant of your life, and
of the part that you play in the world of
men. I should like even to be ignorant of
your name ; but you must at least conceal
your soul from me, that I may always believe
it to be beautiful.
And Musset gave the lovers his bles-
sing, saying, “ You love each other, and
you both love me ; you have saved me,
body and soul.” Body, Dr. Pagello;
soul, George Sand. And Musset added,
later, “ I am going to turn it all into a
novel ” ; while the woman e\ claims, in
one of her letters : “ Oh, why cannot I
live with both of you, and make you both
happy, without belonging exclusively to
either ? ” For she was tiring of the new
love, and looked back through the rosy
mists of remembrance at the Venetian
honeymoon. And Pagello went and
Musset came back —but not for long;
and there were “ructions,” and George
Sand cut off all her hair and sent the
parcel to Musset, and went about discus-
sing the state of her heart with Liszt and
Saint-Beuve and Heine. And when the ’
affair was concluded, Musset —thrifty
man!—turned it, as he had promised,
into “ copy ” —-his Concession d v,n Dnfant
du Siecle, in which he took all the blame.
But the affair was, Gribble claims, neces-
sary for the proper literary development
of the poet. After all, the man scored.
His sufferings narrowed his compass, but
made his note more intense. A new poet
arose from the ashes of the old. ... He had
been born with a passion for tears and for
the luxury of woe. He would assuredly
have been “sad as night only for wanton-
ness ” in the absence of any more compelling
reason. George Sand gave him the reason
he lacked, and so made his pain poignant
and his, melancholy sincere. To that extent
we may say that she helped him, and served
literature in doing so.
The suggestion might be adopted, say,
in England—for the sake of Literature.
If, for instance, Hall Caine and Marie
Corelli had a honeymoon in Venice, each
would 'have some quite interesting
“ copy,” and. the resultant novels of each
might be a little nearer to the real thing.
Is it impossible, even now ?
So, later in life, Musset wrote :
One is often deceived in love, often hurt,
and often made unhappy—but one loves ;
and on the brink of the grave one looks back
and says to oneself : “ I suffered much ; I
was deceived sometimes ; but I loved. It
was I who lived, and not some factitious
being, the creature of my pride and my
tedium.”
It is the lesson of Henry James’
strange story of The Tie cist in the Jungle.
And he died an habitual drunkard. But
George Sand was always physically
healthy. The next was an advocate,
engaged by George Sand in a separation
case'’between herself and her husband.
And again her new lover was excellent
“ copy.” Some of her letters to him were
published in the Revue des Deux Mondes,
and he figured in her Lettres d'un
Voyageur. Then came her private secre-
tary, Mallefilie, .. . and others .. . till we
reach Chopin. And the affair with
Chopin lasted eight years. It beg an hy
George Sand kissing the musician as he
played to her ; she was thirty-four and
he twenty-eight. And when Chopin
died her dear wish for a sentimental
climax —“ He shall never die in any arms
but mine” —was defeated. She was
turnqd away from the dying genius’s
door. She was then forty-live, and a
grandmother, and—worst doom of all
she was getting fat. "-Still there were a
few others—of little literary importance;
and she saw her daughter, Solange,
keeping up the family traditions with a
zest that equalled that of her mother.
George Sand, though an excellent mother,
by dressing Solange as a boy typically
showed that masculinity which Weniager
postulates as part of all women of genius.
And the old fat woman contrived to grow
old with dignity, and died amid a psean
of critical praise and regret. She had
bui'ied all her lovers in that necropolis of
her heart, and she had acquired the habit
of weeping publicly among the innumer-
able tombs.

A Fine, Strong
HEALTHY Child
67 Murray Street, Pyrmont,
N.S.W. Aug', qth, 1905. “My William
(18 months) suffered from rickets,
acute bronchitis, malnutrition and
wasting. Other preparations were
unsuccessful, but SCOTT'S Emul-
sion thoroughly strengthened and
built up his system. He is now a
fine, strong, healthy child."
(Mrs.) J. MeCANLEY.
The REASON WHY
the Rickets were CURED
The digestible lime, soda and phosphorus in
SCOTT’S Emulsion fed the bones and made
them hard and straight; the Lofoten cod liver
oil (the best in the world) made digestible by
the SCOTT process, covered them with solid,
healthy flesh. SCOTT’S wrought
the cure —not something “just
as good. - ’

Renee.
Gathering- Stars.
No star propitious at my birth
Cast kindly rays upon the earth.
For at the hour when I was born,
Twixt lifting night and purple morn,
My mother raised her head and sighed,
Then kissed her life-in-death and died.
Half-French, half-English, with the traits
That mar the splendor of each race ;
My father’s heritage desire
Unbridled, and my mother’s taint—
Ancestral madness, and the fire
Of wine that’s never known restraint.
Ah, God ! I could not be a saint.
Nor had my forbears ever kept
Their will subservient to their whim ;
My ready passions scarcely slept;
At best I only had a dim,
Blurred inkling of the right. What chance
Had I whose will was Circumstance—
A moth which fluttered round the flame,
Ripe fruit which any wanton wind
Could bring to earth ? Ah, me ! fair game
I was to any such inclined.
So I have grown a thing quite wild—
Part fool, part devil, and part child ;
Fair, soft, desirous beyond ken,
The scourge of boys, the sport of men.
So many lovers through the years
I’ve claimed as mine—but not one friend.
I have no scruples—many fears,
But, most of all, I dread the end.
MAORILAND.
R. E. SELBY.
Last night adown the streets of Space
I saw a troop of girls ;
A blaze of glory lit the place,
And glistened thro’ their curls.
Their cheeks and lips were ripest red,
Their eyes like planets burned :
“ It is an angel hive,” I said,
“ To God and home returned.”
And level with their slender waists
They held their aprons white
(And then I knew no mortal tastes
The ripe fruits of delight!);
And in those baskets improvised
I sadly watched them thrust
The stars that down on earth I prized,
The lamps of love and trust.
At times a gem would flash and fall,
And sparkle, hissing far
(On earth we always used to call
That thing a falling star).
And sometimes thro’ the purple floor
It shot across the night
(We called that blaze a meteor—
If I remember right).
So in and out those ranks I went
In silence for a while,
Till at my look of wonderment
I saw an angel smile.
“ What are to you these jewels worth ?”
I asked in pained surprise.
She said : “We send them down to earth —
For they are maidens’ eyes.
N.S.W.
GILROONEY.
On Manly Beach.
On Manly Beach the Spartan maid,
Disclaiming frills and furbelows,
With flowing arms and naked toes
Cavorts the breakers unafraid.
When Mistress Grundy first inveighed
They ducked her—cap and cotton hose —
On Manly Beach !
Her grim propriety decayed ;
Emancipated belles and beaus
Now flirt, and—tell it not —propose,
Sans chaperon and tailors’ aid,
On Manly Beach !
N.S.W.
W. M. WHITNEY.
The Waster.
“ Do you know a little house where the Gippsland
track divides —
Bare of front and skillion-rear,
Very small, but very dear,
Where, within, an aged pair through all the
changing seasons bides,
And a kindly welcome waits for you besides ? ”
“I cannot quell the wander-lust that surges in
my blood;
I must drift with every wind,
I must royster with my kind ;
There’s a New Spring ever calling, further off,
with bloom and bud,
And a voice beyond the mountain and the flood ! ”
“Do you know a meagre stack and an old, grey
paling shed,
And a creaky, crazy gate,
Where an aged couple wait ?
Do you see them in the night, like dim shadows,
by your bed,
When the red fumes are departing from your
head ? ”
“I have battled with the world, hoping much, as
other men;
Now the waster and the scamp
Of the shanty and the camp ;
A loafing drunken shearer —taint of crime and
gambling-den—
It is better that they know me not again ! ”
“ The moon is on the roof, and it’s Peace and
Calm and Night !
Then go you never more
Like a shadow to their door ;
For they know you’re great and good, and they’re
sure you’re clean and white ;
So hide yourself for ever from their sight! ”

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin ivould oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (ivith regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

SOME FACTS FROM TROPICAL
AUSTRALIA.
Thk official “Vital Statistics” of Queensland for
1906 have come to hand in a skinny-looking, dark-
blue volume, and the contents thereof throw a
few additional lights on the problems of that
tropical land where, according to our Bruce
Smiths and the like, “the white man can’t work.”
Also the blue volume throws a bright illumination
on the condition of a land where Smiths and
such-like disorganised beings allege that the
white man can’t even live. To begin with, it
publishes a table of death rates, already once
alluded to in this paper ; and that table sets forth
the fact—surprising to those who don’t study the
nature of the case, but merely trail along in the
dust-cloud behind the waggon of popular preju-
dice—that Queensland is, with one exception, the
country with the lowest mortality in the world.
The figures are as follows :
Deaths per 100,000 People (1906): —
Maoriland .. .. 931 Tasmania .. .. 1113
Queensland .. .. 956 Westralia .. .. 1187
New South Wales 989 Victoria .. .. 1242
S. Australia .. .. 1034
Let these figures be compared with the returns
for European countries, and see how the white
man fares in Queensland —alleged by “Kanaka ”
Cowley, and a horde of the other political refuse
that follows Philp’s banner, to be a land only fit
for Asiatics—as compared with his luck in the
lands from which his forefathers came :
European Death Rates per 100,000 People (taken from
“ A Statistical Account of Australia and Maoriland,”
page 182).
Norway .. .. 1542 Prance .. .. 2090
Sweden .. .. 1597 German Empire 2147
Denmark .. .. 1665 Prussia .. .. 2208
United Kingdom.. 1737 Italy .. .. 2337
Netherlands .. 1745 Austria .. .. 2566
Belgium .. .. 1809 Hungary .. 2821
Switzerland .. 1843
So, unless the figures can be explained away, we
are presented with the amazing fact that, in the
country which is said to be unfit for a white man’s
habitation, the white man has nearly twice the
chance of living to a ripe old age that he has in
England, three times the chance that he has in
Hungary, a better chance than in any part of
Europe or America, and a better chance than he
has in any other country on earth save Maoriland.
Queensland was always a healthy country for
the white settler, but its really remarkable record
has only been arrived at quite recently. There
have been three distinct stages in its progress. As
the white man moved north into the tropics the
average mortality decreased. As he settled down
and married and had children —who were more
effectually acclimatised than himself—the mor-
tality decreased. And as the nigger and the
Asiatic —said to be specially suited to the climate
—were repressed and became a smaller and
smaller fraction of the population, and as the
white man—said to be specially unsuited to the
country—became a more overwhelming propor-
tion, the mortality also decreased. Let the last
proposition be dealt with first in the light of the
figures for 1906 :
Deaths in Queensland per 100,000 People (1906).
White people .. 937 Hindus, Cingalese .. 1423
Chinese .. .. 1044 Japanese 1538
Syrians, etc. .. 1046 Kanakas 2269
These plain, simple figures reveal the gigantic im-
pudence of the lie about the special fitness of the
Hindu, the Jap, and especially the Kanaka, to
endure the climate of the North. On the solid
evidence of the death-rate, they are not anything
like so fit as the white man. The whole story of
the nigger-advocates is topsy-turvy. Not only is
it a glaring falsehood in the aggregate, but every
separate item of it is a separate and individual
falsehood. The Kanaka, imported because he was
said to be most fitted to stand the northern sun,
is really the man least fitted. The white man, who,
according to the brazen and long-standing nigger
and Kanaka lie, is utterly unsuited to the North,
flourishes there as no other race does, and the
country misses by the barest possible fraction the
honor of having the lowest white man’s death-rate
in all this wide world.
« * * *
The “Vital Statistics” don’t supply any very
extensive data for a comparison of tropical Queens-
land (the north) with semi-tropical Queensland (the
south). Still these figures are made available: —
Deaths in Queensland per 100,000 People (1906).
Brisbane and suburbs (131,102 people) .. .. 1000
Best of State, including the North (401,681 people) 942
On these figures it is fair to assume that if in the
rest of the State (the districts which are neither
Brisbane nor its suburbs) the aggregate death-rate
was not increased to an extent that is out of all reason
by the heavy Kanaka, Hindu, Cingalese, and
Jap mortality, the northern and central districts
would put up a world’s record as a place where
the white man avoids the annoyance of burial.
And this view of the case is further borne out by
the immense decrease in the average mortality
since the White Australia policy came into
existence, since the influx of Asiatics was checked,
and since the Kanaka ceased to be imported, and
death, combined with the drift back to his native
islands, made him a vanishing quantity in the
land :

If the North has been reputed as a place
unfit for the white man to live in, it has been de-
scribed with even more eloquence as a place
only fit for the white woman to die in. Yet as
a matter of solemn fact and plain figures, Queens-
land seems to be about the best place possible for
the white woman who wants to reach a patriarchal
age. The death-rate in Queensland during 1906
was at the amazingly low rate of 783 for each
100,000 women living. The death-rate for men
was 1099 per 100,000, and the two combined made
the average of 956 already quoted. Owing to
the large proportion of men engaged in hazardous
occupations, men die by accident more frequently
in Queensland than in any other Australasian
State barring Westralia. Also the Kanaka and
Asiatic mortality, which is mostly male, swells the
male percentage; that percentage is exceedingly
low, but if it were not for niggers and an undue
proportion of mining and other accidents it would
be a great deal lower. And but for the unwhole-
some nigger and his abnormally small birth-rate,
the births in Queensland would also look better
than they do. They numbered 2631 per 100,000
people in 1906—a better result than that shown by
Victoria or S.A. ; but the birth-rate among the
white Queenslanders reached 2706 per 100,000,
which beat the record of N.S.W., and ran almost
exactly abreast of Maoriland. Still the Queens-
land infant didn’t arrive so often as it might,
but on the other hand it was a fairly good
stayer when it did come to hand. The
common theory of the nigger-labor advo-
cates is that the North is a place where the
white man can’t work, where the white woman
lives in misery, and where the white infant just
comes to hand as a matter of form, and promptly
qualifies for a tombstone in a burnt and sun-
blasted graveyard. Here are some figures on the
subject:—
Out of each 10,000 Infants Born there Died, when
Less than One Year Old :
In Maoriland .. .. 621 In Tasmania .. .. 902
~ N.S.W 745 „ Victoria .. .. 929
„ Queensland ... 747 „ Westralia .. .. 1100
~ S. Australia .. 759
These' are good figures so far as the North is con-
cerned, and if it were not for the occasional
intrusion of the ill-nourished half-caste kid, who
doesn’t get much of a chance for his life in the
squalid dens of imported Asia, the average might
be still better.
* * • *
But the best test of alias regards the healthfulness
of a country is the effective birth-rate —the increase
of population by the surplus of births over deaths.
A high birth-rate is of little value if the children
die, and a low death-rate is not of much value if
the birth-rate is low to correspond. As regards
the effective birth-rate, the latest figures the writer
has at hand are those for the period 1893-1902,
given on page 182 of the official “Statistical
Account of Australia and Maoriland ” :
Number Added Annually to Each 100,000 Inhabitants
by Excess of Births over Deaths.
France .. .. 110 Norway .. .. 1437
Ireland .. .. 511 German Empire 1441
Switzerland .. 974 Westralia .. 1466
Belgium .. .. 1046 Netherlands 1. 1471
Italy .. .. 1087 Prussia .. .. 1474
Sweden .. .. 1088 S. Australia .. 1493
Austria .. .. 1127 Commonwealth.. 1521
Hungary.. .. 1162 Maoriland .. 1629
England .. .. 1194 N. S. Wales .. 1633
Scotland .. .. 1197 Tasmania .. , 1697
Victoria .. .. 1296 Queensland ... 1750
Denmark.. .. 1356
To be at the very top of the world’s effective
birth-rate isn’t a bad record for the tropical land
which, so the London Times hints, should be set
aside for Hindu immigrants, on the ground that
it is eminently suited to them and not at all fit for
people of Anglo-Saxon descent.
* * * *
How does it come, in the face of these figures,
which are available to eyerybpdy, and some of
which have been available for quite a number of
years, that there are fools or knaves in Australia
who still talk of the unfitness, of the North, for
white settlement, and its eminent adaptability for
the Jap, the Hindu, and the Kanaka ? As
regards the knaves, who are, after all, probably
not so very numerous, the cause is in most cases
merely a desire for cheap labor and a callous
readiness to wreck their country for ever if
thereby they can save—or think they can save—a
few shillings in the immediate present. As regards
the fools, who are many, the trouble seems to arise
out of the importing disease and the resulting
habit of regarding everything Australian, even
Australian proofs and evidences, as of no account.
Almost every tropical country except North Aus-
tralia is made unhealthy by the presence of a
great, ignorant, insanitary colored population,
and by filthy, undrained native cities that reek
with disease. “Therefore,” says the man who
imports his facts and statistics, “all tropical
countries must be unhealthy,” and the fact that
Queensland, which extends further north than
any other part of Australia, can show the lowest
death-rate, bar one, on this globe makes no differ-
ence to that kind of man. Then in other tropical
countries it is infra dig. for the white man to do
hard work, for there is a cheap nigger to work for
him ; moreover, his pose as the conqueror, the
boss, and the superior being must be maintained.
Consequently, there is no white working popula-
tion —the only kind that is qualified to give an
opinion as to whether the white man can
work and keep his health in the tropics ; and from
sheer force of habit the lazy white population of
professional men, hotel-keepers and sundries has
decided that hard work in the tropics doesn’t suit
the European. (As they never worked hard in the
tropics or anywhere else, the value of their
opinion is limited.) Their view of the case has
also been imported, and folk like Beuce Smith of
N.S.W. and “Kanaka” Cowley of Queensland,
who can see India and Egypt and other far-off
lands, but who can’t, in their imported super-
ciliousness, see the land they live in, say quite
seriously that the white man can’t work in the
tropics, even while he is doing it by thousands
before their eyes, and has been doing it for many
years. And because the black man does the hard
manual labor in other tropical lands it has come
to be taken for granted that he is specially
suited for tropical labor, though as a matter
of fact the death-rate even in his own
country suggests that he is mostly a feeble
being unfit for hard work anywhere. So it
comes to pass that dull repeaters of other men’s
theories, like Smith and Cowley, talk of the
black Kanaka’s special fitness for tropical labor in
Queensland, even though that miserable wretch
has been dying in heaps before their eyes ever
since he came to this country. The importation
of ready-made opinions, which no more fit this
country than a blazing Christmas fire suits the
Yule-tide season at Bourke, and a blank resolve
to be oblivious to the evidence that is before their
eyes because it isn’t imported evidence, accounts
for the existence in our midst of Bkuce Smith,
“Kanaka ” Cowley, and their kind.
• * * *
Yet this is especially a case in which imported
evidence doesn’t count. The Australian from the
North is almost the only man on earth who de-
serves to be heard on the question of the suit-
ability of tropical climates for white settlement.
He is almost the only witness whose evidence is
worth a straw. Not only has he Been There, but
he is the only man on earth who has Been There
on a large scale as a manual worker. Northern
Australia is the one tropical land on the map
where the tropical climate has had a chance—with-
out other and totally irrelevant considerations
getting in the way —to show its fitness or unfitness
to the white man’s constitution. It is the only
tropical land where the climate hasn’t got its
reputation spoiled by the diseases that arise
through the presence of dirty nigger cities or
towns or encampments swarming with an insani-
tary nigger population. It is the only tropical
land where the white working man has unani-
mously taken up the pick and shovel and put the
question of his suitability to the proof; in other
hot lands there has instead been a weedy person
of the quill-driving class, loafing in a white suit
on a verandah and calling for a nigger to bring
him whisky squash. Further, Northern Aus-
tralia is, unlike India and many other places, a
tropical land where a large white population
has come to stay, to get acclimatised, and to bring
up acclimatised children and grand-children, who
also mean to stay. In most of the other tropical
lands of the British Empire there is only a shift-
ing white population, which comes out from
England, and pants for a few years in a white
suit, and then goes “home” again. Therefore,
on the question of the suitability of white men—
even such white men as the Briton, German,
Dane, Russian, Swede, Norwegian, or Finn—to
live and flourish in a tropical climate, provided
they live decently, and work hard enough to keep
their muscles in good condition, and provided the
insanitary nigger is kept at a great distance, the
Australian should reject all evidence save his
own. He is the man who has Been There. And
no other man has Been There in so complete a
sense.
THE QUEENSLAND ELECTION.
Next week Queensland has to decide among three
applicants for the State Premiership. Of Bow-
man, the leader of the Labor party, it knows
little by actual experience, for he has never been
in office ; but if, by any chance, he even distantly
resembles the late William Browne, of the same
party and the same State, or if he presents a
fairly accurate resemblance to Thomas Price, the
Labor Premier of S. Australia, then Queensland
might do worse than put David Bowman at the
head of affairs. Of William Kidston it knows
that he has been a good democrat, an honest,
steady financier who pulled Queensland out of the
incredible and hopeless-looking bog into which the
wretched Philp Government dragged it, and a
sturdy, hard-working, level-headed citizen. Of
Robert Philp it knows that he is, in a political
sense, the worst fool who has held high office in
Australia, an incredible spendthrift, a spineless
politician who is used by everybody with an axe
to grind or a swindle to perpetrate, and is the
laughing-stock of a group of colleagues, who only
keep him in the leadership of the party because
his mild respectability lends an appearance of
decency to acts which would otherwise be regarded
as outrageous. A well-meaning man is poor,
weak, foolish, wobblesome Robert Philp, and
when a full-grown male citizen is described by his
friends as “a well-meaning man,” it is the same
kind of casual insult that is implied when a
female is alluded to as “the remains of a fine
woman.” It puts him on a level with the famous
Sarah Gamp, whom Bailey, junior, so,defined in
one of his brighter moments.
The worst mistake made by Premier K iiiston
during his term of office. . mas his m-gW-.r.
to pass a law providing 1 ffor a, .s,eqpn.dj
ballot in every case where no,candidate,,.ejatains
an absolute majprity-.qf .the yijtes polled., If
Queensland possessed such a’law there .w.ejtfld be
no danger of a return of the Philp calamity to
office. Philp’s chance lies in th© splitting\of the
Democratic vote between Kidston and'BowMAN.
He has.on his side all the people who have jobs
to perpetrate or schemes on hand for looting the
Treasury; such people recognise him as just the
sleepy, incapable kind of sentinel who will allow
the Treasury to be looted with impunity. The
dull people who want things to remain as they
are support Philp. The big land-grabbers are
with him. So are the people who seek “conces-
sions,” the people who would fain sack the
white workman to make room for niggers, the
people who desire to destroy Australian manu-
factures in order to make room for imports,
and the people who want huge loans and a
great boom and a glorious financial drunk in the
hope that they may snatch some pickings and
perquisites out of the ruins of Queens-
land is a large, rich, fertile, thinly-peopled land
where there is still much room and much plunder
for utterly unscrupulous adventurers. These
adventurers shove Philp to the front because he is
too weak to get in the way of any be 'v’s schemes
of plunder, and is respectable enough, : his own
harmless fashion, to lend a cloak of decency to their
proceedings, and because he can attract votes which
they couldn’t by any possibility attract themselves.
And by a wholesale buying up of newspapers—
one of Philp’s colleagues and political parasites is
supposed to own more country papers than any
other three men in Australasia —the looters of the
old brigade are able to create in favor of Phiip a
sort of bogus public opinion which imposes on a
fairly-large section of the community.
V * * *
And yet it is difficult to remember, any political
gang in any English-speaking country with a
worse record than that of the crowd with which
Philp has always been associated. It borrowed
close on three millions, which it used, without
Parliamentary sanction, to prop up its private
interests in the Q. N. Bank, but the bank made a
heroic smash all the same. The directors of the
Q.N. were mostly clumsy incapables of the old
Philp-Mcllwraith following, and their muddle-
ment was so stupendous that even all these bor-
rowed millions couldn’t keep the big institution on
its feet. Queensland had become so utterly rotten
through many years of the Philp crowd’s manage-
ment that it was the only State in Australasia
where every bank went under in the crisis of 1893.
The Philp party raised Queensland to the position
of the State with the Biggest Debt per head on
Earth. Under the control of the Philp crowd
Queensland’s credit sank so low that it sold its
£lOO debentures at £BB 12s. 4d. in a frantic effort
to keep the pot of dissipation boiling. Philp’s
own politico-financial record was that he was at
the Treasury for five fairly prosperous years, and
piled up deficits amounting to £953,764 ; while his
successor, Kidston, was also at the Treasury for
five years, and, with a smaller revenue, made an
aggregate surplus of £723,772. There is not, in
all the record of Philp management, one out-
standing feature which suggests that Queens-
land’s amazing Premier is capable of adding
two and two together, and knowing whether
they make four or not. Twenty years or
so back his old partner in the firm of
Burns, Philp and Co. gently shouldered him
out; and nothing has happened since then to
show that old James Burns ever regretted that
he lost Robert Philp. When one considers what
chances Queensland possesses—its fertility, its
vast area, its fine climate, the splendid and regu-
lar rainfall which makes a great part of it the
garden of Australia, its splendid gold, copper
and tin deposits, its many rivers and harbors, and
the other advantages which make it pre-eminently
Australia Eelix ; and then remembers that Philp
and his friends only managed to make of it a
place with the boss debt of the world, a country
with every bank suspended, a land where niggers
and Chinamen swarmed while the white man took
up his carpet bag and fled —it is difficult to realise
that anyone should again dream of Philp, or any-
body who had ever been connected with him, as a
possible candidate for office.
* * * *
Apparently Philp is a man in whom there is
something lacking. He isn’t ashamed of his
shocking political past, because he is probably in-
capable of understanding that there was anything
wrong with his political past. He doesn’t blush
for his monstrous deficits, or for the fact that he
ran the credit of Queensland down to something
near the level of a nigger republic, because he
can’t see why anybody should make a fuss about
public solvency. He doesn’t apologise for his
stupendous debts and his imbecile waste of
borrowed millions, because he can’t under-
stand what else borrowed millions, or any
other millions, are for. In some sense he
seems to rank with Charles IV., who was
cheerfully arrested by a bailiff for non-payment of
his meat bill, and who regarded the matter as a
joke, being unable, in his sloppy incapacity, to
realise that an Emperor of Germany should blush
when his chops and steaks were a notorious bad
debt. Philp is in the category of Duncan Gillies
who lived and died in a state of blank amazement
that anybody should refuse to consider his boom
budgets as serious finance. He has the cheerful
irresponsibility of that Harold Skimpole whom
Dickens invented—likewise he possesses Mr.
Skimpole’s uselessness and many other of his
qualities. In his utter failure to realise what a
statesman should be Philp apparently regards
himself as one, or something good enough to pass
for one. Australia has raised many quaint in-
capables to high places, but it neverhad another
Philp, and it is to be hoped that it never will have
another. In his large, loose, untidy good-nature, his
shambling tendency to promise anything which will
fetch a vote at the moment, his inability to say
“no,” his knock-kneed kindliness which makes him
willing to let anyone loot the Treasury to-day, and
his instability, which makes him rise to-morrow in
frenzied panic when the cash-box is empty, and tax
everybody, and cut down everybody’s salary, and
borrow everything so as to have something to go
on with—in all these things he is a public spasm
and clown. Nature meant him for a cheerful,
slipshod, shambling Bohemian—happy, out-at-
elbows, always in debt, always irresponsible, and
always pursued by duns and bailiffs. Then acci-
dent made him a politician, and there seems to
be no remedy for mistakes like that.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“How England had Progressed.”
“ He explained how England had progressed under
Telegraph, on the speech of Dobson
m the Senate.
It is calculated to make any reasonable white
.citizen feel 'tired —this weary narrative about
4 ‘ bow England progressed under Freetrade.” For
Australia isn’t England, and its situation to-day
ia.as-unllke that of England when the Ma Land
firs|; experimented with Freetrade as anything
cap,be,. What Australia wants its dull, mentally-
sddjden Freetraders to tell is the story of some
nation which, situated as Australia is, adopted
Freetrade and prospered. When England com-
menced its Freetrade career it owned about one-
third of the manufactures of the world (it now
owns about one-sixth); it was the first manufac-
turing State on earth (it is now the third); it
owned more than a fourth of the world’s


shipping (the proportion remains about the
same); it had much more than one-third
of the world’s steam-power, and it was sup-
posed to do about half the world’s banking
business. The news that a country, which had risen
to that pinnacle under High Protection, has con-
trived to hold its own to some extent even under
Freetrade, after about 20 or 30 years of competi-
tion with Protectionist communities, doesn’t in-
terest Australia worth a cent. This country
wants its Dobsons and Johnsons, and Millens
and Neilds to tell it the inspiriting tale of some
country, which, beginning from scratch as it were,
created its manufactures, and its steam-power,
and its teeming population, and its greatness
generally under Freetrade. We know that
Holland is Freetrade in the main, and that it is
fallen from its old high estate. We know that
Ireland faced the beginnings of Freetrade with
practically no manufactures, just as a small gang
of shoddy imbeciles would have Australia do ;
that it has lost half its population since the
awful experiment commenced ; and that it is the
one fearsome example of depopulation on earth.
We are aware that the United States, Canada,
Argentina, Germany and Japan all somehow com-
menced their industrial rise when they established
a Protectionist tariff. We know that there is not
one manufacturing industry of any size or im-
portance in any State of Australasia which didn’t
rise with the aid of Protection. We know that
Britain sent a violent Freetrader (Cromer) to be
the benevolent autocrat of Egypt, and the only
way he could find to resurrect the industries of
that dead country was by the imposition of a
heavy Protectionist tariff. And naturally we want
some Freetrader to arise and explain—or explain
away—these things, instead of pounding the old
straw with the old flail and telling us about Eng-
land. England is as much out of place in the story
as an iceberg would be at Timbuctoo. It was
an old fat country, bloated with almost all the
affluence of the earth, when it took to the doc-
trine of Cobden. Australia would like to hear
about a new lean country like this one, which
took to that doctrine and grew fat. It is aware of
various lean countries which tried the experiment
and didn’t grow fat, but they are another story.
The United States, and Canada, and Germany,
when they were industrially young, tried Cob-
denism, and as long as they kept to it they
remained dog-poor, and as soon as they gave it up
the fattening process commenced. Naturally,
Australia wants some old Dobson or other to
account for these circumstances. But above all
it wants the Freetrader to account for the case of
Ireland. Ireland was the one industrially un-
developed country in the world which got
pure Freetrade, and got it in a heap, and
got it for a long time. And among all
the white man’s lands of the world Ire-
land is the one horrible example of a
country that has lost half its population in
60 years. Its people survived war, massacre,
anarchy, and persecution, and continued to
increase; but Freetrade came, and the nation
mostly vanished. If Joe Cook, and Neild, and
Millen and Bruce Smith and their kind can’t
give a reasonable explanation of the Irish Free-
trade horror, then they had better sit down. No
sensible person wants to hear them. Ireland is
the one case in all the world which parallels
what Australia’s case would be if this country
took Neild’s advice and Millen’s. It supplies
the only precedent worth talking about in the
tariff connection. Therefore when a Freetrader
rises to heave foreign instances and examples at
an Australian audience, he should always hold
forth at great, length about Ireland. Failing that,
he should be howled off the premises for irrele-
vancy.

Oil—Solar, Palm and n.e.i.
The House of Reps, did practically nothing for
the Australian oil industry. The old position and
the new compare like this :
Old Tariff as it
tariff, left the Reps.
Lubricating oil, gal 3d. 3RI.
Solar and residual oil, gal. .. Jd. Id.
Benzine, naphtha, etc., gal. .. Jd. fd.
Greases, cwt. .. . . . . 2s. 2s.
Paraffine wax, lb. .. .. Id. Id.
Kerosene, bulk .. .. .. Free Free
Kerosene, tinned .. .. Free Free
In only two lines is even a small scrap of ad-
ditional Protection given. Minister Lyne did
propose a trifle more in the interests of the
kerosene-tinning and casing industry ; but that
great, implacable, soulless octopus, the Standard
Oil Trust, stretched out one of its corrupting
tentacles, and even that little atom of
proposed duty shrivelled up. To-day, there-
fore, kerosene comes in free, whether it be
in bulk or in case, whether it be owned by the
Yankee octopus or the rival British co. What
the Senate will do about the matter yet remains
to be seen. The Senate certainly owes it to itself
and to Australia to give the business special con-
sideration. It cannot disregard two things—one,
the notorious character of the Standard Oil Trust in
itsdealingswith Legislatures; theother, the Trust’s
extraordinary activity while oil was before the
Reps. Born and reared and housed in a country
where the corruption of petty State Legislatures
has been reduced to a fine art of which this Trust
itself is the great master, the Standard iniquity
for the first time found it necessary to use its best
professional efforts upon an Australian Legisla-
ture. And it is a deplorable thing to have to
admit that, so far as one House at any rate is con-
cerned, it won ; and the other House is especially
bound to see that that victory was gained only
by the force of those arguments that you can’t
cash at a bank. But, apart from kerosene, Tariff
Bill Lyne, though even his proposals were cut
down, erred on the side of timidity so far as oil
duties are concerned. He saw probably that an
English co. with almost unlimited capital at
command was already willing to invest vast sums
in the shale-oil business, and apparently he
accepted that as proof that the duties were re-
garded as already sufficient. It is true that the
Commonwealth Oil Corporation has sent a million
or so this way. But there are other true things
besides. Not only has that co. not paid a dividend,
but the co. whose business it took over
was not able to pay a single dividend
during all the years in which the old
tariff was in force. Moreover, there is
a danger ahead of the new co. which
the eld co. did not have to face. If it does what
it proposes to do, the new concern, as it extends
its processes, will turn out at least 5,000,000
gallons of kerosene a year. Obviously it
will be to the interests of the Standard
Oil Trust to prevent the co. reaching
that point; and the best way to prevent it reach-
ing that point will be to knock it out of the
Australian market for lubricating, solar, and other
such oils. Years ago, before the Standard Trust
became the highly-organised iniquity that it is
to-day, Australian shale workers had produced a
high-class kerosene, “The Southern Cross” ; but
it was made perfectly clear to them that their
market for all other oils depended upon their
taking the Australian kerosene off the market,
bo the Australian kerosene went, and the Aus-
tralian shale oil cos. were allowed to drag out a
precarious existence turning out the cruder stuff.
And some of them didn’t even attempt that;
manufacture being discouraged by Parliament,
they simply exported their shale—sent it off,
dirt and all, to some foreign country to supply the
foreign workman with wages, the foreign manu-
facturer with profits, and the foreign bank and
the foreign bank-depositor with interest-earnings.
It has been a poor, miserable business altogether,
and when it had the chance the House of Reps,
lifted no more than its little finger to help it. Yet
it is a ease which calls for a whole hand—along
with a whole, energetic foot to help out the
corrupting Octopus.
Labor and the Federation.
The new Federal Labor leader Fisher made a
first good mark by hisspeeeh, at Botany (N.S.W.),
on Saturday. The Political Labor Conferences
were drawing near in Australia, and Mr. Holman,
a N.S. W. State Labor member—with his unerring
instinct forgetting on the wrong side of things—
made an announcement last week in Sydney Tele-
graph which was tantamount to a declaration in
favor of the State Frights idiocy in politics.
Inter aliu he said :
The existing Federal Parliament consists of two
Houses, in one of which a Westralian, because he is a
Westralian, has ten times the voting power of a man from
New South Wales. This anomaly is borne with because
it is said that in all domestic matters New South Wales
will be governed by her own Parliament; but if domestic
matters are to be transferred to the Central Parliament,
then in both Houses of that Parliament citizens through-
out the Commonwealth must carry equal weight. To
unify without getting rid of the present Senate would be
to set up a most indefensible form of government, while
to merely transfer functions from the State Houses to the
Central House, leaving everything else as it stands,
carries us no nearer to unification, and only adds another
element of confusion to the chaos which exists to-day.
One Parliament or the other can legislate on every topic
to-day. To transfer one topic— e.g., control of juvenile
labor in factories, from the State Parliament to the
Federal Parliament would not be to add a new pow'er to
the self-government of the Australian people ; it would
only mean that one more subject would be placed in the
control of the Federal Parliament with its undemocratic
Senate.
The absurdity of talking of the Federal Senate,
elected on a basis of full adult suffrage, being
“ undemocratic.” as compared with the State
Upper Houses —elected on a property qualification
suffrage, or consisting of nominees of the Crown—
is so patent that it probably does not need to be
pointed out. But it needs to be remembered that
the Labor party in N.S. W. has been anti-Federal
before, and probably has the want of capacity to be
misled’into becoming anti-Federal again, judging
by its attitude on the borrowing question, and on
other matters. So it is well that Mr. Fisher
realised the responsibilities of his leadership and
rebuked Mr. Holman at the Labor picnic, on
Saturday, with a firmness and wisdom worthy of
the Watson tradition
The nominee and privilege-elected Chambers of the
State Parliaments were out of sympathy with Australian
democracy, and should be brought to an end. T) 1 c
workers of Australia should look to the Federal Parlia-
ment as the best machine for working out their salvation.
In the national Parliament they had two Houses, elected
by the people, on the broadest possible franchise,
and it was through this medium that they should
seek their rights. He asked the workers to turn
their attention more to the Federal side of poli-
tics than to the State side. The party needed it.
No other party had a national aim ; none could assemble
representatives from all the States as they would on
Monday, representatives holding the same views, inspira-
tions, and political hopes. The man in Westralia
was as much an object for their help as the man
in Sydney or North Queensland. The party should be the
guardian of every citizen in the Commonwealth through
the national Parliament.
That is the right note. From the Australian Parlia-
ment, which is the people’s Parliament as well as
the nation’s Parliament, which is not stained with
one remnant of the old order of privilege
crowned man s privilege or rich man's privilege—
and which is amply safeguarded by referendum
against any tendency to become fossilised, Aus-
traliahas everything to hope and nothing to fear.
I he State Parliaments in their present form must
inevitably drift to final dissolution. Practically
the only reason they have now left for existence
is the vanity of their members ; and a few peacock
tails cannot be allowed to stand in the way of
Australia’s progress.
White Australia.
British political parties are only of vital interest
to Australia in so far as their respective views on
Imperial questions affect Australian matters.
The so-called “ Conservative ” Party has lately
scored in Australian regard because of its sensible
attitude on the fiscal question and its seeming
willingness to put the matter of Imperial De-
fence on a basis at once efficient and consistent
with the self-respect of the over-sea Com-
monwealth and Dominions. But an issue,
far more important to Australians, now obtrudes
into British politics, and in discussing it the
so-called Liberals” seem to be more disposed to
take the right side than the Conservatives. On
the question of the right of white communities to
shut out of their territories Asiatic and other
colored immigrants whose presence is inimical to
their civilisation, some of the Conservative papers
show an inclination to take the wrong side ; and
they may carry their party, or a section of it, with
them. On the other hand, such of the Liberal
leaders as have made any public pronounce-
ments on the question have been emphatic to
assert the right of the self-governing white com-
munities to control their own immigration policy.
Mr. Winston Churchill has spoken to that
effect, and last week Mr. Birrell put the case
well. According to the cables :
Ridiculing the vague platitudes so common about “our
glorious Empire,” Mr. Birrell asserted that people
ought to consider how far a central authority could exer-
cise control over great self-governing communities. “ We
are not in a position,” he declared, “ to dictate upon such
matters. Besides, would lofty idealists like 50,000 Indians
to be seeking work in British collieries or shipyards? ”
That repeats the argument so often used by The
Bulletin that, if the stay-at-home Englishman
had any real knowledge of the social and
industrial results of colored immigration,
he would be as fervent a “White Eng-
lander” as could be desired. It is well
to find British politicians seeing things in that
light. There is really but one absolutely vital
plank of Australian policy—White Australia.
Discussion of almost any other point of our legis-
lative policy with a view to modification can be
imagined as possible. But there can never be any
discussion about “White Australia.” It is a
principle, not an expediency; a religion, not a
view.
The Many Dirty Municipalities of Sydney.
A RECENT Sydney Health Board report, dealing
with food inspection, announced that some 15 of
the 40 doyly municipalities had neglected to take
any milk samples for analysis during 1907 —many
of the others took hardly any—and last week the
S. M. Herald sent a man ambling round among
the council clerks to find out why this was thus.
Here are some of the reasons the Herald got:—
Alexandria —The limited income of my Council is all
required for the upkeep of roads. We have no money for
the expenses of an inspector to look after the milk and
foods used by the people.
Enfield —Why do you want to know about the milk ?
There is no special reason why the newspapers should
say anything about it. No good will come of it. The
fact is that under the Local Government Act the council
clerks, who are also inspectors of nuisances, have quite
enough to do with office work without having to go out
and take samples of milk.
Darlington —Why do we not take samples of milk?
That’s our business ! There are enough inspectors after
the unfortunate milkman without me joining in the
chase, and if I did I might get a sample here and a sample
there, and it would not be worth going after it. The milk
of Darlington is pure, and we know more about it than
the Health Board. They sent an inspector to me, the
other day, and asked me why I don’t pay more visits to
the milk shops. I told him I went once a quarter, and
I was not going to do any more.
Willoughby —We think it unnecessary. We have such
an honest lot of dairymen in our district that there is no
fear of them selling bad milk. We did get samples a year
or tivo back, and they were all right.
Botany—The milk out here is lirst-class. We have no
occasion to get samples.
Bur wood —There is only one man here to do all the work,
and that is myself. I have never found it incumbent
upon myself to go out and take samples.
Redfern —Well,, the fact is we have no time. The
inspector is also foreman of works, and his time is fully
occupied with such work.
Canterbury —The council clerk is also inspector, and
got behind a bit with his work, which was very heavy last
year.
Drummoyne— l can’t tell you why we don’t take
samples of milk. There is no particular reason. It is a
matter for the council, and they are satisfied on the
subject.
It all makes pretty reading. On one point, how-
ever, that Enfield functionary was quite wrong.
Some good unll come of the publication of this sort
of thing if this sort of thing is published often
enough—it will hurry along the time when a
Greater Sydney will wipe those cheerfully-
insouciant and dirty municipalities out of
existence.

The Law-abiding Chow.
When the advocate of a yellow, or partly yellow,
Australia unburdens his soul in public on the
question, one of his stock-arguments is the peace-
able nature of the Chow. He is described as
being chivvied by small boys and chased by
larrikins, but as bearing it all with exemplary
patience. Also, the same Chow is held up at
arm’s length as a man wfco obeys the law and
never interferes with anybody. Of course, this is
largely fiction; but the fiction was never so
flagrantly apparent as it has been in Victoria
during the past few weeks. In fact, anyone
reading the daily papers carefully during that
period might have been excused for concluding
that the Chow formed a majority of the popula-
tion, instead of being a mere handful of it.
The bright particular shocking example of the
Chow’s innate rectitude came from Bendigo,
which for some months has been in a fer-
ment over the question of gold-stealing from the
mines. The police, since the new Act was passed,
have got to work on the gold-buyers; and so
many Chows have been arrested that the gaol
looks like Chinatown, and the police court like
Lilly Buck-stleet. The police raided pretty well
every Chow store in the place, and almost every
store they raided panned out one or more Mon-
golian criminals. Cartloads of specimens, scales,
mortars, and all sorts of quartz-treating appliances
were found, and gold in the shape of nuggets and
dust was discovered. One Chow offered £2B to a
policeman as a bribe. Another had £IOO worth
of dust and retorted gold. There were gold, and
quartz, and squealing Chows everywhere. Some
of the Chows had elaborate plants, including
secret cellars, which took the police some time to
discover. Others carried on the trade of the
“fence” openly. But the moral of the tale lies
in the fact that the vast bulk of the trading
Chows of Bendigo were all busily engaged, not
only in breaking the law themselves, but in help-
ing and inciting the miners and others to break it
as well. In all the cities the Chows are recognised
as champion fracturers of Factories Acts and
Health Acts. A few days ago, quite a horde
of Chows were fined for selling diseased fruit;
•and, near where the writer lives, five Chows con-
spire every Sunday to break in several pieces an
Act of Charles Two against working on Sundays.
It is an old and very frail Act, but the five Chows
break it just as cheerfully as they break the
brand-new Acts. The Commonwealth made a
praiseworthy attempt to close down on the opium
trade ; but the Chow is daily inventing new ways
to circumvent the law, and is driving decent,
white Customs House officers to drink in the pro-
cess. It probably wouldn’t be safe to tell Dr.
Wollaston just now that the Chow is a law-
abiding person and a brother. Instead of the
Chow being law-abiding, he is most distinctly our
champion criminal. Also, he is an annoyance
and a fraud, and if Australia could get Tid of all
its Chow population at one swoop, it would be
worth while commemorating the date as a thanks-
giving day.

Private Enterprise at a Fire.
A certain recent night was calm, which was a
streak of luck for Newcastle (N.S.W.); had there
been any wind there probably wouldn’t be enough
Newcastle left to be worth arguing about. That
night Cohen and Co.’s big warehouse was burned
down, and the blaze, which could be seen past
Maitland, threw a lurid glare on the landscape
and the way Newcastle manages its fire-fighting
business. It is a sorry story—of a confusion of
volunteer brigades rushing indiscriminately into
action, and, without cohesion or combined leader-
ship, gettingin each other’s way ;of leaky hose-pipes
that wasted the water through their sides instead
of utilising it through their nozzles ; of antiquated
reels and manuals that would have been inefficient
at a bonfire; of firemen scrambling up water
pipes and verandah posts for lack of ladders, and
dragging their colander hose laboriously after
them ; of the volunteers having to leave their
antediluvian squirts before the fire was
thoroughly conquered, and scoot off to
their daily toil to avoid being docked
a day’s wage by patriotic employers; of com-
plaints and jeers and general irritation. Granted
a capful of wind and that fire might have made
history. Newcastle and suburbs possess 22
brigades—all volunteer ; and among them there
is no cohesion, no combination. Each drills as it
likes and buys what appliances it likes. New-
castle West has a 30-year old American engine;
Stockton owns an ancient steamer, and one or
two other brigades have hot potato cans of some
sort. The remainder of the stations possess only
reels or manuals such as might be regarded with
derision by the hairy inhabitant at Tibooburra.
Not one station possesses a horse—the men have
to rush round and find a cab or a milk cart to
persuade their ancient artillery to the scene of
action. There are no long ladders—in fact there
appears to be very little of anything up-to-date.
The root of the whole trouble seems to be that New-
castle has no Fire Brigades Board. The volunteer
brigades are supported by Government grants;
but if the city brought itself under the Fire
Brigades Act it would have to raise one-third of
the cost of the brigades’ upkeep by municipal
taxation, and seemingly Newcastle prefers to risk
being burnt off the map rather than pay that
morsel of extra taxation. Just now the city is
wearing a thoughtful look, and remarking that
something really must be done. It felt that way
after a fire two years ago, and Superintendent
Webb was sent up in haste from Sydney to report
on the subject. Newcastle just gazed on Webb’s
report, and let things slide. Probably, if left alone,
Newcastle will let things slide this time also. A
long while ago, State Premier Carruthers spoke
glowingly of a new Fire Brigades Act to bring all
the brigades into line under the Sydney system of
upkeep, but, before the reform materialised, Car-
ruthers began making faces at the Australian
Government and forgot about the fire business.
Now his successor, Wade, is understood to have
a Bill somewhere about him, but as Wade is also
busy distorting his physiognomy at the Common-
wealth, it is likely that the new Fire Brigades
Bill will be eaten by wild rats before anybody
remembers its existence.
308 in the Bag ; 109 in the Shade.
On January 17, while the Melbourne Observatory
thermometer registered 109'3°, and Gaunt’s instru-
ment in the city said 112° in the shade and 155° in
the sun, a gang of men finished off the loading of
the Loch Katrine at Williamstown. She is an
iron ship, with iron decks, on which, in such
weather, an elephant would blister its feet. Ven-
tilators and windsails were fixed to carry the
“ breeze ” below, but what little did go down
smelt like a blast from Hell’s furnaces. Minus
boots and hats, naked to the waist, a score of
lumpers sweated d° wn there from 7.30 a.m. till
7 p.m., with but a couple of short intervals. As
the bags of wheat were lowered by the winch, each
lumper tackled his task, hoisted a bag on his
neck, climbed the tiers of stacked bags with the
load, and tipped and squared it into its place.
Commonwealth Minister Chapman says 2001 b. is
an ample weight for these bags ; Wade and the
farmers say 2401 b. or 3001 b.; Bent shuffles. Every
bag is weighed as it passes the tally clerk. He
was asked for a few weights. “ Certainly. Here
you are: two-sixty-five, two-sixty-three, two-sixty-
four, two-sixty-seven ” Ten bags tallied
26501 b. altogether; the next ten, 25641 b. Just
then a bag slid down into the hold. The
lumper waiting for it was a middle-weight who
tipped the balance at list. 81b. when he started
work that morning. He looked at the bag, and
hesitated ; but it was his turn, and he was game.
He got it on his neck, carried it 16ft. into the
hold, up three tiers of bags and over. That bag
weighed 3081 b stone exactly ! And yet these
things are not the worst; a 6101 b. bag turned up
the other day at Port Adelaide.
The Brahman Person.
“J.R.”: Things in the Transvaal are getting
exciting, or would be, if there were anything
more than talk. Some of the things that are
getting into print (if the cable-man is not a most
astonishing liar) are quite too silly for words.
There is said to be “ an angry correspondence ” in
the London Times :
Especially about the degrading registration; which
means taking an impression of the ten digits.
Does that mean that the impression is the de-
grading part of it? If so, there must lie quite a
remarkable amount of degradation all over
southern Asia, for 99 men out of every hundred,
instead of signing their names, snihar ink on the
palm of the hand, or the tips of the fingers or
“The Carnival of Crime.”
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
A reply to “ The Ghost ” (Bulletin, 2/l/’08).
O ! the armies of Australia, beating bolted gates
oL breath,
Lifting up their ceaseless prayer in voices thin,
For the privilege of living, for the gifts of life
and death—
Don’t you hear them pleading, pleading—“ Let
us in ! ”
O ! the legions never listed, and the hopes that
might have been,
Crying God ward from the factory and the mart,
Where tliey’re feeding, feeding, feeding, to a
ruthless red machine
All the motherhood that wells up in the heart.
Grieve not, bard, that nightly, daily, on the broad
highways of Scorn
Mammon’s daughters hold high revel round a
hearse!
But mourn ye, mourn ye, mourn ye for the
woman bosoms torn
With vain yearnings for the babes they may not
nurse 1
Mourn not the shrine of Fashion, ’tis the fetich of
the Few,
The fallen Few, soul-dead and doubly damned,
In whom wakes no repentance for the feeble
things they slew
Tho’ they heard the gates of Hell behind them
slammed !
’Tis not such as they who bear the conquering
nations’ bone and thew
By their travail thro’ the solemn gates of Birth !
’Tis not they who are the promise of the ages,
ever new—
To be fruitful and replenish all the earth !
But grieve for fruitless manhood and the hopes
that might have been
Crying Godward from the factory and the mart,
Where they’re feeding, feeding, feeding, to a
ruthless red machine
All the motherhood that fain would play its
part!
For the lank, lean-breasted women with their
faces famine-grey,
For the men that shuffle by with drooping head,
For the desperate faces hidden from the horrors
of the day
In the twilight of the quiet river bed !
For it’s drawn by Pride's high steppers down the
highway of the years,
The hearse vjhereon the merry death bells chime !
But ever-, an ye listen, ye may hear the women's
tears,
Who are robbed to run “ The Carnival of Crime.”

Although as The Bulletin has, in its
wisdom, written “ nd jury would ever agree on
the ideal whisky,” any knowing jury would
certainly agree that D.C.L. is a sound and safe
whisky, and that taken in carefully graduated
instalments it will assist the intellect out of tight
places either in regard to science, business,

thumbs, and make an impression on the paper.
The hundredth man uses a stamp. And surely
this ought to be the climax :
A Brahman pleaded that he belonged to the highest
class of Indians, who had representatives in the House of
Commons, and in the Council of India, and that com-
pulsion was contrary to their principle.
Whose cook is he? It is not generally known
that Hindus who can afford the luxury, even
when they are of low caste themselves, aspire to
the honor of having a Brahman cook. When the
Alien Act first came into force, a Hindu shop-
keeper in an Australian capital, whose cook was
goingaway togethis caste polished up, actuallygave
up his business because he couldn’t get a permit
to import another. There never was a Brahman
member of the House of Commons, and very
few Brahmans have ever risked the pollution
likely to result from crossing the sea—a risk that
has more than once driven sepoys to mutiny.
According to strict Hindu law, the Brahman is
an incarnation of the Deity, and is so sacred that
if a Sudra touches him, or even his clothes, the
Sudra must die. The Brahman has never been a
warlike man, and so, when Turks, Afghans,
Sikhs and Mahrattas were fighting with each
other, or with white men for the upper hand, the
Brahman became clerk, secretary, and general
office factotum. Clive’s banker, Omichund, who
ended his days on the gallows for forgery, was a
shining example of the excellence of the Brahman.
That person’s activities are considerably circum-
scribed by the British system in India, which
refuses to be influenced by considerations of caste
or creed. It showed that in the promotion,
several years ago, of a native barrister to
the Chief Justiceship of the Calcutta Supreme
Court. He belonged to one of the lowest
Sudra castes, and all Brahmandom burst
out in one universal howl at the insult offered to
the Hindu community. It would, perhaps, be
better for Brahmans to moderate their transports
in view of the history of their tribe. They are
quite ready to boast of their supposed sacredness,
but they carefully keep out of sight the fact that
one of the greatest examples of treachery and
cowardice—known to the world at large as the
Nana Sahib —was a Brahman of Brahmans. He
had the distinction of impartially fooling everyone
connected with him. He persuaded the two
mutinous regiments at Cawnpore to enter his
service, got Wheeler to give him charge of the
arsenal, and fooled the old man to the last; then,
when Havelock was advancing, he packed all
his treasure on swift elephants that he had kept in
reserve, and bolted for Nipal, leaving the sepoys
lamenting the loss of their pay.
The powerful North Coast Steamship Co., which
enjoys a practical monopoly of most of the northern
coastal trade of N.S.W., is making good money
these times. The latest addition to its fleet (the
Orara) has just arrived from England, and is a
revelation to old timers who remember the sort of
craft that used to do service on the coast. On
the arrival of the new streak of glory the co. gave
a shivoo on board, and speeches were delivered
by the shipping people. They eulogised the en-
terprise of the N. C. Co., and spoke severely of
the inertness and supineness of the Government
in not seeing that the various harbors, to which
the co. trades, are kept in an efficient con-
dition, so that the enterprising co. can earn
still larger dividends. There was not one
speaker there to point out that in its
struggles against Nature the State has already
spent some millions of money, and that to-day the
annual expenditure on the bars of the harbors
of northern N.S.W. more than equals the
whole profits of the local coasting trade, big as
these are. Nor was there one speaker pre-
sent to delicately hint the desirability of a
special tax on the shipping that uses these
bar harbors, in order to provide a slight return
on the huge outlay of the community. The users
of the State roads pay rates. Even the North
Coast Co. would not expect to run its private
truck on the Government railways for nothing.
Yet it cheerfully uses—and often solely uses—the
river entrances formed by the Government, and
doesn’t pay a penny for the benefit. Instead, it
boasts its cheap means of transit, and puts itself
forward as a sure winner in competition with the
proposed North Coast railway.

Hebburn started the recent industrial troubles at
Newcastle. Coal-cutting machines had been
introduced there, and the miners said that the
electric cables “sparked,” and that it was too
dangerous to work with sparking cables in a mine
where gas had often been found. The em-
ployers’ attitude was simply—“ Pooh ! What
do you know about it ! Trust us experts to
know what can be done with safety.” And
the public to a great extent said, “Of course—
that’s so.” Now, Newcastle is gradually caving
in. Did the owners and managers know in that
case what could be done with safety ? Perhaps
the fat Newcastle property owners who are shiver-
ing in their shoes may begin to think that these
miner fellows, after all, are not such fools in
refusing to absolutely trust the judgment of
owners and managers.

The Sydney-North Shore bridge, after lagging
drearily on the political stage for 50 years, and
being the butt and joke and chestnut of all manner
of politicians, is, so it is reported, to be referred
by the Wade Government to a committee of
experts. Surely the foolishness of an incompetent
State Insect could go no further than this. The
bridge has passed the “committee of experts”
stage over and over again, and been dropped.
It got as far once as the calling of
tenders, and then again the procrastinating State
person dropped it. It has, in fact, got to quite
a lot of stages at various times, and then always,
by way of saving some dawdling State individual
the trouble of making up his mind, it has been
started afresh at the committee of inquiry stage,
in the same way as a middle-aged man
might get into the habit of periodically going
back to infant school and learning the alphabet
afresh. What is wanted now is a Premier
who will hunt up the plans which he has already
in hand, and push through Parliament an
appropriation out of revenue of, say, £1,500,000,
payable in three yearly instalments, and get
to work. Sydney doesn’t want to see the
fifth, or tenth, or twenty-fourth Commis-
sion sitting for months and taking the same
old evidence over again, and then reporting
at great length, in a year or two, that if a bridge
is built it should be put in the most convenient
place, and be high enough to let vessels pass
under it if they aren’t too big, and that it had
better be built of steel, and have some kind of
prop in the middle.

Sydney Telegraph is mad because Defence
Minister Ewing has sent its “militaryrepresenta-
tive’s” remarks on the Commonwealth’s Defence
Proposals to Roberts, Field-Marshal, for his
criticism, and to General lan Hamilton for his
opinion. The stupid old paper ought to feel
flattered, but it doesn’t like to face big guns:—
Lord Roberts and General Hamilton have not proposed
conscription for Australia. They are advocating it for
England, a country very differently situated.
It is very differently situated. It has only one-
twenty-fifth the area to defend, and eleven times
the population to do the defending, so it doesn’t
want compulsory training one-hundredth part as
much as we do. It also has immense industrial
establishments where ships, artillery, and war-
like stores can be produced almost without limit,
either as to quantity or time, while Australia is
only just beginning to feel its way towards such
things. However, the Telegraph doesn’t care
a rap what Roberts, Field Marshal, thinks. It
has consulted with its beard, and made up its
alleged mind
Lord Roberts, in advocating compulsion for England,
has met, as yet, with no sort of success in actual results,
and this is Australia, where the people have the deciding-
of their own affairs, except when people can contrive to
smuggle that right away from them without popular con-
sultation or authority.
So Ewing has no authority, and Deakin has no
authority, and presumably the Parliament which
Deakin and Ewing represent has no authority.
It sounds stupid ; but a little thing like stupidity
doesn’t worry the Telegraph. By the way, what
is the Telegraph ? A Stock Exchange list says
that it is some sort of a daily circular issued by
about 120 people who own some shares. That
seemingly is the extent of its own authority.

The soured anti-Australian person who always
has a grievance against the Commonwealth because
it isn’t merely his little State is perpetually falling
in, and last week he fell in something extra. A
Sydney firm—Robert Macdonald and Co. —
wrote a dreadful tale to the S. M. Herald about
a multitude of its letters that had gone astray in
the Federal post office, and quoted as its worst
instance this case :
Only a few days ago a cheque for £35 W’as posted to us
from Cobar. This was picked up by some Italian fruit
hawker in King-street to whom
(to King-street apparently)
we had practically to go down on our knees to claim our
OWN.
This looked like a knock-out for the post office till
one Percy Josephson wrote to the Herald in
reply. He said (1) the Italian wasn’t a hawker
but a shopkeeper ; (2) that the cheque was found
in King-street in an unstamped, unaddressed en-
velope, that apparently hadn’t beeH posted any-
where, and for which the post office couldn’t be
held responsible; and (3) that the Macdonald
person hadn’t to “practically go down on his
knees,” for the cheque was handed over without
demur. This was a fairly broad charge of false-
hood, slander, and misrepresentation against the
Macdonald person. Then a postal official went
to the Macdonald person’s premises to investi-
gate the rest of the charges. He reported .that
the firm had a dilapidated sort of letter-box,
through which letters sifted on to the floor, and
the bottom of the door was so wide apart from the
floor that the fallen letters sifted or drifted or
blew out into the passage, and could be annexed
by anybody. So the best thing is, apparently,
for the firm to get a new letter-box, and a little of
the sense of fair play in its dealings with the
Commonwealth, and some better business methods.

After the last issue of The Bulletin went to
press a daily paper statement threw what seems
to be a new light on Victoria’s subsidised steam-
ship line to Singapore. It is now alleged, on
behalf of the unions, that the Currie line doesn’t
pay anything like the standard Australian rate of
wages, which the Burns-Philp line pays, and if
this is so, all public sympathy should be with
the non-subsidised Burns-Philp line. The
curious point is that, according to the
story now told, the Burns-Philp people
refused to lay this overwhelming point before
Premier Wade. Apparently it was held to be
beneath their dignity to mention a mere wages
question, so the case laid before Wade depended
upon hazy and unprovable remarks about the
injury done to Sydney traders where no definite
injury could be shown. If Victoria has subsidised a
line which pays a semi-nigger rate of wages, so
that it may compete against a line which
pays full white man’s wages, then the whole
iniquity deserves to be kicked from Sheol to
breakfast. The only power that can do the
necessary kicking is the Australian Parliament,
and it can do it best by hustling the Navigation
Bill through the Senate. Unfortunately the
still more important Tariff is in the way, and,
seeing that the awful Jawbone Neild has pro-
pounded about 200 amendments all tending to
destroy Australian industries in order to make
room for imports, the Tariff is likely to be in the
way for quite a while. Yet, no matter how much
Neild yearns to destroy Australian industry,
Parliament should not adjourn till the Navigation
Bill is passed, and quite a lot of other measures
as well, including especially the one providing for
the taking over of the Northern Territory by the
Commonwealth.
“Business-man” Philp, of Queensland, bought
one estate, the Seaforth, for close settlement, and
made such a shocking bargain that Seaforth hasn’t
got any close-settlers to this day. Now it is
alleged by the Kidston paper, the Freeman*
that Philp lias bought Mary vale. Even a Govern-
ment that represented Parliament wouldn’t be
justified in spending £90,000 without authority,
except in a case of urgency ; yet PHilp is alleged
to have made this purchase, though it wasn’t
urgent, though he had no authority, and though
he doesn’t represent Parliament—three times in
as many days the Assembly said it had no con-
fidence in him. Chelmsford threw Popular
Government into the gutter; Philp is busy
treading it well into the dirt. A man with
Philp’s political reputation who goes around
buying up vast properties with public money is
getting dangerous. Yet, if the amazing story of
the purchase is true, The Bulletin begins to see
why the big squatters and landlords put up a large
election fund for the Tory cause.
The magnitude of the forthcoming Franco-English
Exhibition at Shepherd’s Bush, London, is as
little known hereabouts as the absurdity of the
importance which Bent and other provincial Pre-
miers are attaching to their respective State
exhibits. The buildings as a whole will be an
immense show-place, half a mile in length, and of
the comparatively small area allotted to the
Greater Bri tains, the Canadian Government has
bespoken just twice as much as will be shared
among the various divisions of this under-
federated country. Even if they were all
gathered under the general name Australia, the
display would look small in comparison with
that of Canada. In its State subdivisions, dis-
tinguished by names foreign to the average
visitor, this country cuts a petty figure at
any exhibition on the other side of the world.
But the Bents are proud of their pettiness. Any
private firm attempting to put one section of the
paltry show on the broadest possible basis is
thwarted by a BENT-in-office. For instance, Bur-
goyne and Co. proposed to take the-management
of an Australian wine exhibit, and do the thing
in a way calculated to increase the foreign demand
for Australian burgundies. The proposal was
rejected. The wines of conflicting States will be
represented, as is usual at such shows, by
small arrays of bottles, bearing the names
of local merchants who have never exported
a gallon of Australian wine, and whose advertise-
ment is not worth twopence to the vineyardists
whose grape juice is thus offered for sale. What
is true of the wine trade applies with almost equal
force to a lot of other trades. A number of small
exhibitors send their little displays to sundry
Agents-General, and the Agents-General receive
them in a shopkeeping spirit of rivalry, and pro-
vided that N.S.W. “outshines” Victoria, or vice
versa, a few Australians in London send a glow-
ing report of the achievement of their native
province. It is a curious fact that the very people
who cry Stinking Fish when they should be sing-
ing praises are apt to sing praises where they
should proclaim the bad character of the Fish.

What is the secret charm possessed by
“Charley’s Aunt,” which was revived on Satur-
day night last at Sydney Criterion ? One would
expect from a play that has run unnumbered
thousands of nights in London and the British
provinces, that has been translated into French,
German and Italian, and been played to good
houses in most of the great cities of the world,
some quality of extraordinary excellence—or ex-
traordinary badness. Yet repeated and close
scrutiny fails to reveal anything either very
admirable, or very execrable, about “Charley’s
Aunt.” It is just an ordinary foolish roaring old
farce. The plot rests on a preposterous assump-
tion. No young man the world has ever known
could, m the garish light of day, impersonate an
old lady and go undiscovered for ten minutes
outside the precincts of a blind asylum. The love
interest is feeble, and here again the probabilities
are strained till the whole of the play’s mechanism
creaks in protest. Nothing particularly bright is
said by anyone. Yet last Saturday night—as
on every other night during the long years
that have elapsed since it was first produced
in London—” Charley’s Aunt ” went with
amazing vim. Everywhere, young women were
to be observed shrieking discordantly in their
glee, and allowing their hair to become dis-
hevelled ; the while tears of helpless amuse-
ment furrowed the cheeks of their young men.
The conclusion is that the writers of that piece
have the same divine ichor in their veins as
Marie Corelli and Hall Caine. Theirs is the
mighty gift of being able to write paying slush
for the multitude. A characteristic of this gift is
its annoying defiance of analysis.

Frank Thornton is excellent as the bogus
Aunt. It is not enough to say he works; he
simply slaves. The mere sight of him fleeting
across the stage, bounding on to tables, and per-
forming the other strenuous feats his part calls for,
induces a smart perspiration in the onlooker!
Harry Ashford is sufficiently asinine as Spettigue!
the solicitor, into whose silk hat the tea is poured •
and the other male parts are well handled. The
four iwjinues are charming ; and Miss Harriet
Trench, as Donna Lucia, is such a millionairess
that a man were a maniac not to marry her if he
could.

Except that with the perversity of genius
and charming widows, Johnny Sheridan had a
cold last week when everybody else in Sydney
had a bake, nothing of much consequence has
happened at the Palace pantomime. While the
Countess was in her solitude steeping her feet in
mustard-and-water (she dared not call in a doctor,
knowing to what sin and Costs a foot may lead
him), Lanphier gushed in the Widow’s place.
But after this week there will be no more gush.
School has started, and Geography has abolished
the Pantomime; and the board that last week
bore the legend “Standing Boom Only,” will next
week say instead, “ To Let.”

The Williamson management listened to
the cry of the Sydney critic hungering for some
new comic-opera Girl to rend ; wherefore she of
Gottenberg, likewise she of Rottenberg. will give
way at the end of this week to “The Dairy-
maids.” On the whole, this paper has its doubts
whether the lady who milks the cow professionally
has time to cultivate the frivol that musical
comedy calls for ; but probably J. C. Williamson’s
dairymaids belong to a country where the land-
lord doesn’t bail up the milkman quite so energetic-
ally, and that would make a difference. Any-
how, Saturday night, at Her Majesty’s, will tell.

“ The Scarlet Pimpernel ” will keep going
until Saturday week at Sydney Royal. It has
been a vigorous scarlet runner, this play.
* * * *
Wonderland City, which still keeps its
cool seductions open on the Sydney coast, has
decided to issue “ concession tickets.” An adult
can now do all the side shows for 2s. 6d.; a child,
for Is. 6d.

An epidemic of last nights is raging at
Sydney Tivoli. Edwin Boyde continues to be
the mainstay—also the larboard watch and
the binnacle—of the programme, but that
authentic document says the end of his stay
is fast approaching. Others announced as
packing their trunks are Finglas, the Ideal Coon ;
Ray and Calden; Tom Burrows, the club
swinger ; Martin Henderson, the blind musician ;
and our valued friend Tom Dawson. The
Bioscope is full of wild animals that don’t smell—
which is a blessing this weather—and the rest of
the company stepdances with unabated vigor. On
Saturday next a gentleman called Dumont, all the
way from Paris, will teach the populace how to
play something called Diabolo.

THE PANTO.
[For The Bulletin.]
One’s Wheel of Life is bound to go
Whilst vital power controls it ;
Or fast or slow,
For weal or woe,
For short or long time rolls it.
And at the Pantomime we learn
Lessons in nature human.
The Wheel revolves that man may yearn
For joys which change with every turn ;
On every spoke his eyes discern
The charms of lovely Woman.
She decks the Wheel and makes it go,
She gives the glory to the show,
But'life is most uncertain.
From seats on high, or stalls below,
We watch her whirling to and fro,
Till slowly falls the curtain.
The Woman gives us mortal breath—
O, Wheel of Life ! O, Shades of Death !
When surely falls the curtain,
vie. E.F.
These versified reflections on the gaudiest
item of the panto, at Her Majesty’3 (Melbourne)
are the result of long familiarity with its title.
Severally and jointly Humpty and Dumpty are
depressing terms, and the present writer hopes
they will not occur again in a Grand Christmas
Annual, seeing that they are more suited to “East
Lynne.” They have been before the Melbourne
public for six weeks thus far, and will be con-
tinued till further notice with enormous success.

Apparently the heat-adjournment of H.
Flemming and Co. led to contemplation and
thence to reconstruction of future plans; for, on
Saturday last, Melbourne Princess’s reopened with
“The Mummy and the Humming Bird,” two
final performances of “ Olivia ’’ being reserved for
to-night (Thursday) and to-morrow. The illness
of manager Flemming, the unctuous, portly
“Mummy” of yore, necessitated the substitution
of Winter Hall in his place, and the hard, dry
personality of that tall understudy presented the
“Mummy” as more of a scientist than he had
appeared in his plumper and broader form. A few
people were glad to renew their acquaintance with
the unearthly splendor of the “ Humming Bird’s ”
similes and metaphors. To the sober citizen, he
is too surely an unbecoming Dago associated
with bananas and ice-cream. His thick eloquence
fails to suggest a convincing partner in a ripe in-
trigue. Indeed it looks as if, in acquiring a
cosmopolitan outlook on woman from Sicily to
London, he got an insight into the poetical license
of much British poetry. All the time he is in a
state of liquid romance and excitement. He
spurts and bubbles like a soda fountain—but,
without companionship of a sort, he would be
pitiable. For instance, if it were possible to im-
agine him a monk sent to fizz by himself in a cell
with nothing to fizz upon but holy contemplation
and the biographies of the saints, he would ob-
viously become an insane Dago of the most hope-
less character, and his fate would be too horrible
to contemplate. On Saturday, “ The Red
Lamp” will (D.V.) cast a radiance significant to
the Melbournian, brought up in an atmosphere of
melodrama and tram accident. The fact of “The
Red Lamp ” being announced as by arrangement
with J. C. Williamson had led to a wildly foolish
suspicion that it is identical with the Lamp of
Aladdin or the Sacred Lamp of Burlesque, but
the suspicion was promptly dismissed as ground-
less.

TO AN OLD FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ah ! the dear night, old Lady from Brazil,
When first we two across the footlights met;
The mem’ry bitter-sweet is with me still;
You are a female one does not forget.
I, you will recollect, Aunt, was a lad,
A callow lad, and by me sat my Girl,
Slightly self-conscious she ; and rather sad
And humorless—but otherwise a Pearl.
Your “business” didn’t “go” with Nell a bit
(Romance, I mind me, was her leading suit);
Mirth was a reef (she held) on which Love split,
Making of man a cold, sarcastic Brute.
Do you remember in the Second Scene
Th’ explosive laugh that on a sudden sped
From Row 14, Stall 6 ? ’Twas I—l mean
’Twas mine, that awful laugh to raise the dead.
Thereafter (as you know) I shed restraint,
And yielded me to bliss without alloy,
And—disregarding the protesting plaint
Of neighbors—writhed and bellowed in my joy.
Last week I met you, Aunt; again ’twas night,
Yet somehow you but emanated gloom ;
On my bowed head your old gags shed a blight,
They seemed to wear the cere-cloths of the tomb.
My Girl —another Girl—was on my left.
In dismal silence I observed her glee ;
Why should she shriek as though of sense bereft
At jokes which in no wise appealed to me?
As the long evening dragged I knew the truth,
More than a different Girl a decade brings.
Aunt, you’re an emblem of my vanished youth :
That is the serpent-thought whose sharp tooth
stings.

To-morrow (Friday) night Anderson
vacates the Melbourne Bijou premises with “ Her
Luck in London,” in order to allow Miss Florence
Baines to try her luck in Melbourne on the fol-
lowing evening. Miss Baines’ particular article
of faith arrives with a considerable Sydney
record, and is entitled “ Miss Lancashire, Ltd.”
On cursory inspection, it look like the label of a
gorgeous Wild Cat; but, as the advertisement
states that it will add to the gaiety of the com-
munity, the. imputation is hereby withdrawn.
Still, intending speculators should see for them-
selves whether “Miss L., Ltd.” is calculated to
live up to the immense language of the prospectus.

The intention of West’s Films and Frivol
is to vary the ratio of Frivol to Films, or rather
to Fact, according as one or the other slumps in
popular estimation. Even the Very Best People,
of course, prefer to enjoy the light and hilarious
incident rather than retain a stolid countenance
say, the fine, but semi-tragic grounding of
H.M.S. Montague, or the towing into port of a
section of the Suevic. But then there are folk,
apart from encyclopedists and historians, who are
whales for two hours of Fact, so Fact and Frivol
have to be discreetly alternated.

At Melbourne Opera House two “ turns ”
of moderate importance have passed away, but
the Four Eugenes (due on Tuesday of this week)
are doubtless committing wonderful double-somer-
saults and things, according to advertisement.
With the Three Sisters Klos, a trio of Cunards,
and a quartette of Eugenes on the bill, the enter-
tainment at Rickards’ is like unto a cherry
tree, the fruit whereof is picked singly or in
clusters. Among the' single cherries Miss Lottie
Kay has been hanging longest on the tree, and is
one of the picks of the basket. Which metaphor
is mixed, but complimentary.

At Adelaide Royal, Miss Florence Baines
has shown herself a buxom humorist, with ap-
parent experience of the Variety stage. “ You
do want a lot for your three, two, and one,” she
grumbled good-naturedly to an encoring audience
one deadly hot evening. Her play is wild farce,
punctuated by tunefulness. Peacock, of the Pic-
tures, has come back to the Town Hall; and there
is trick cycling at the Tivoli by the Kranks. But
all things in Stageland are very, very quiet.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Diavolo ” has “ looped the loop ” once too often, and
has been killed by falling from his dangerous elevation at
Singapore. In private life “Diavolo ” was J. O. Carter.
“ Harrison O.” : For journalistic hogwash, how’s this,
cut from below a photo of soubrette Billy Burke in the
Royal Maga. : “ Her photo, stained with blood, was found
on the body of a young officer, unknown to her, who was
killed in the Thibetan expedition.” Her photo stained
with ber-lud—lovely, red ber-r-lud ! What more can the
Royal’s public want to know about anybody 1
“Blue Peter”: The “gods” at a melodrama can see
subtle moral distinctions that' are quite beyond the ordi-
nary person. At the new Bilanderson show, “ Her Luck
in London,” the villain asks the beaigiful country girl to
come and live with him in London, which, with a sad
lack of originality, he refers to every time as “ that
gerrrreat city.” He draws a highly-colored picture of the
attractions of the gerrrreat city, and the heroine
wobbles. She is just about to say “Yes,” when
suddenly she fixes a wild eye on the far corner
of the ceiling. “ See, see the spider after a
poor little fly ! How his cruel eyes gleam ! ” The spider is
only about 18ft. away. A girl with sight like that ought
to get a job as war correspondent. The fly escapes, and
she turns on the villain and refuses his offer with con-
tempt (great applause from the gallery). The villain sets
what he calls a “ terrrap ”to compromise her. She falls
in, and is turned out of her home. “ Now you will have
to come with me,” says the villain with his best “ Ha,
ha 1” “Yes, I will go to London and throw myself into
the life of pleasure.” And she describes at length how
she is going to be the worst woman in London. “ But
Richard Lenowen,” says the noble girl with a fine burst
of scorn, “ I will not go with you. I will go alone ! ”
Limelight and huge applause from the gallery. I could
not see that it made any difference myself, so at first I
thought there was an Ibsen society up in the bob rush,
but I found out afterwards that they applaud at the end
of a paragraph, irrespective of the sentiment. The
gallery’s approval is guided, not by principle, but by
punctuation.
“ Harrison O.” : I want to know how it is actresses like
being photographed with dogs, 'monkeys, and other
animals in their arms or upon their shoulders? The
more hideous the beast, the more its physiognomy is
thrust upon the public, through the medium of picture
postcards and such like. Tittell Brune, for instance, is
photographed with an ugly brute of a pug perching upon
her shoulder. Camille Clifford is generally “ taken ” with
a monkey in her arms. She, by the way, informs all
interviewers that she considers this animal “ just sweet.”
Admirers of Gertie Millar rarely look upon her cheeky
little phiz, without at the same time looking upon her
terrier. It pleases me to see that Clara Butt is not like
this. When she wants to be photographed, she just grabs
hold of a few of her kids, perches Joy on her shoulder,
Boy on her knee, Coy by her side, Mark Foy by her other
side, and perhaps puppa on some more side, and the trick
i* done.
English dramatists find an increasing difficulty in fitting
their titled characters with names which have not
ac ua ly figured in the blessed Peerage one time or other.

from each, and one duet; prices, one guinea and half-a-
And it was only by an unwearying persistency
that the grimly-determined audience succeeded in wrest-
ing a couple of encores. Then Ken. Rum. came on to
express regret that his wife could not comply with the
many requests for “Abide With Me,” owing to the
‘already heavy programme.” Heavy ! Then what would
they call a Dolores programme of some 14 or 15 songs ?
Orossley, too, sang eight to ten songs a night without
being exhausted. So, as neither Mr. nor Mrs. Butt looked
used up, a sceptical crowd pounded away in spite of five
or si x curtseyi ng returns, and finally secured another duet.
“ Kodak ” : I hate Stodger. I hate Stodger’sphonograph
and his damaged records. When Stodger winds the infernal
thing up and slips in a record, he says, “ Now, you listen
to this—this is good. It’s scratched a bit where I let it
fall, but that doesn’t spoil it much. It’s Patti singing
Tosti’s ‘ Good-Bye.’ ” Then there is a sudden burst
of sound, like a maniac sawing a sheet of tin. Faintly
above the screaming of the saw, you hear a
woman down an alley telling someone that
something’s falling. You strain to catch
what the words are, and instantly the
maniac leaves off sawing, and a velvety
voice—with a mere flavor of tin—
coos four words at you, “and
fa-ding tree Sha-dows .”
Here the maniac starts off
with a fresh burst of energy,
and saws about ten yards of
tin at a fearful rate. The in-
stant he stops, Stodger’s
machine sings at you “ What
are we waiting- for, oh-ho my-
hi heart?” This wakes the
maniac from his reverie and,
with the saw firmly clutched in
his hand, he howls and flings
himself on a whole iron fence and
rips and slashes it to bits. By
the time he’s got it done the
woman down the alley is heard
saying “Good-bye for ever.” The
maniac is almost dead from over-
exertion, but he manages to have
another dreadful slash. “Good-bye
for ever ! ” yells the woman in’ a
fainter voice. (Evidently she is his
wife running away from him to save
her life.) The maniac answers with a
yell of rage, rubs the edge of the saw
on the roof, then trips and rolls off the
house-top with a furious scream. Stodger
takes the record off and says, “Not so
bad, is it ? ”
“ Hambr ” : “ Franko’s ” manager (B,
2/l/’08), who decorated country towns
with curious pictures, secured as samples,
took a lot of unnecessary trouble to save a
very small expense. Australia is full of
superfluous “paper” brought by imported
shows ; and when the imported show has
run its course it’s glad enough to get rid of
the stuff. I know a man who secured 3cwt.
of pictures from a departing American show-
man for ss.
“ Hiphen ”: I’ve been ruining my thinking apparatus
trying to classify “ Humpty-Dumpty ” among theatrical
products. It is not a pantomime, that’s certain. There
is only one fairy in it, and a similar quantity of demon,
while clown, harlequin and transformation scene are
entirely absent. Nor can it be grand opera. One or two
of the songs have a suspicion of tune in them. It is cer-
tainly not melodrama. There is no villain in evening
dress, and no comic relief. It cannot surely be intended
as musical comedy ? There is too much plot for that.
It can’t be classed as a modern problem play. There’s
nothing immoral or suggestive in the whole piece. It
might be described as a variety show if only there were a
nigger minstrel in it. I confess myself baffled. Anyhow,
the show, whatever it is (whether melo-comedy or melod-
opera, or musical dramedy or pantodrama, or any old
thing), moves along well and brightly. But, of course,
anything with so many well-defined legs in it should be
able to move a bit.
Rose Robinson, the amateur lady of quality who
recently appeared before a London beak charged with
impersonation of one of the Cold County’s divorced
aristocrats, will be remembered as one who played small
parts in an imported company here pretty long ago.
After a lapse of years she again appeared in Melbourne
and Sydney, and became talked about owing to her habit
of always appearing on The Block carrying a walking-
stick, and with a book tucked under her arm. Stories of
her aristocratic parentage went the rounds, and it was
generally given out that she was a clever and taking
lady, much given to literature, and guilty of writing
books herself. In Sydney she dwelt at the Metropole,
in City boarding houses, and lastly at a Potts Point
hashery—in that locality she dropped the “Lady,” and
was known as plain “ Mrs.” Her purse must have
been none too heavy, as she left in a White Star liner.
In Australia it was said that the fair one had gone out to
the Transvaal butchery as a Flossie Nightingale, and had
won the heart and name of a young sprig of nobility.
Many of the Very Best People vied with each other in
entertaining the lady, and Australia’s most long-winded
and hifalutin son beamed on her in friendship and
admiration.
“Sr”: Climbed up Melbourne Opera House stairs,
lately. If it is not a sacrilege to mention the “First
Part,” I wish to remark some. The merry, merry Pier-
rots, who kickingly protest they are “ happy, happy, all
the time,” ought to be summoned for making a false
declaration, and convicted for wilful and corrupt perjury,
for what time the “ First Part ” items issue they look as
miserable as a Salvarmy ensign with sand in his eye.
The “ First Part ”is always the same. There’s always a
baritone who gurgles something about “ Deep, Deep
Down ” ; always a tenor who trills something about
“Down where’the Kookaburra’s Laughing”; always a
“ ” singer who throws up his hands to Heaven
and falls on his knees what time he talks about
“The Gallant Firemen” and “The Brave Old Sailor.”
These artists always wear the same old, strict evening-
dress. What would happen if they didn’t wear white
gloves, Heaven only knows. There are always Some
“Sisters” who baulk and run off at every high note they
meet in a song, and who dance cleverly together ; always
three coon songs which introduce “honey” and
“money,” “Sue” and “ You-00-00-oo ” ; likewise the
same old orchestral coon-song introduction which, trans-
lated in words, goes—“ Bang, bang. R-R-R-U-U-Um-ta ;
Um-ta, Um-ta,” until the coon is ready, then “Bang!”
A coon singer who can go head-over-heels is always
guaranteed a “ recall.” Always there is a second : rate
comedian, and generally a soprano balladiste. Finally,
the same old kick of the “supers,” and the same old
advertisement curtain. Then, in the interval, someone
opens the old lemonade bottle in the seat behind you and
lets the same old contents run down your same old back,
and says the same old “ Beg your pardin, matey.”
From London (Dec. 4): We defied the Censor on
Sunday night. The Incorporated Stage Society gave a
private ” performance of “ Waste,” Granville Barker’s
prohibited play, and so we, the members of the society,
went to see it, brave enough to go when we knew the
Censor couldn’t interfere. We did many terrible things.
P eo l? ,e all ° ver the country were coming out
of church just about the time we went into the theatre.
Inrst, we broke the Fourth Commandment in order to
learn how Henry Trebell broke the seventh. Then we
broke the London County Council bylaws, which are
supposed to safeguard the lives of playgoers by prevent-
ing the placing of chairs in the gangways of theatres,
lhere were seats everywhere on Sunday. We sat on
chairs in forbidden places on a forbidden night in order
a°i„ See ., a f° r }> ld< l en play. Over the road George
Alexander Bedford, the Licenser of Plays, probably
thought to himself what a paradox it was that,
in England, Sunday night is the only night
on which one can see an immoral play without being pro-
secuted. “ Waste ” was clever, there was no doubt. But
so is Locke’s “ Human Understanding.” You wouldn’t
like four hours of that on a calm Sabbath evening.
Briefly, “ Waste” tells how Henry Trebell, a brilliant
young politician who belongs to neither of the two big
parties, plans a Bill for the Disestablishment of the
Church, upon the back of which the Conservative Opposi-
tion hopes to get into power. Then, when it is practi-
cally settled that he shall join the Tory Cabinet, a married
womanjwhom he has compromised dies after a self-sought
operation, the performance of which is
death. A scandal is threatened, and the Tories throw over
Trebell just as Gladstone threw over Parnell. Trebell
blows out his brains “to make the Premier think,” and
the curtain falls as his secretary cries, “It is awful.
What a waste of a good man’s life ! What a waste ! ”
Most of the rest is merely character-sketching and talk
brilliant character-sketching and wonderful talk, it is
true—for Mr. Barker, after Mr. Shaw, is the cleverest man
writing for the British stage ; but still nothing sufficiently
dramatic to keep even the Savoy Theatre full for nearly
four hours.

gettin’ Norman Lindsay to draw pictures of our push
when yer leave out the best blessed theatre in Australia?

President Roosevelt has been investigating
things, and finds to his disgust that since the Jap
began to bloat himself out, American shipping in
the Pacific has declined to such a degree that a
letter from San Francisco to Chili has now to go
via Europe. He has also ascertained thateveiy
Yankee company still trading with Asia is losing
money, and that the German and British lines
that used to hold the China coastal trade have all
been supplanted by ships carrying the Chrysan-
themum flag. The Japanese secret is high subsi-
dies and low wages, and the President’s proposed
remedy is bigger subsidies still, so as to enable the
Yankee to pay his high wages and yet undercut
the Jap freighters. In plain English, Roosevelt
proposes that the U.S.A. should engage in a war
of cut rates against Japan, and reduce the struggle
to one in which the longest purse must win. And,
of course, the logical end of that sort of thing is
war—which is merely competition carried to its
extreme point.
How pachydermatous the average fat Tory
is ! Had half the insults levelled at Bent’s three
well-to-do Exhibition Commissioners, who are to
get £5OO apiece for looking as ornamental as pos-
sible for a month or two at Shepherd’s Bush,
-London, been slung at the adherents of a Labor
Ministry, any self-respecting bricklayer would
have chucked up the “honor” long ago. Then
there was Sachse, whose attempted German piano
deal made his resignation eagerly desired ; and
Malcolm Kenneth McKenzie, who could see
nothing wrong about his land dealings. These
lories seem to slop along minus any sense of
decency.
Dear Bulletin, — Re that vice-president
of the Immigration League (B. 16/l/’08). It is no
use selling him ; the proceeds would not be suf-
ficient to provide the League with a pen-wiper or a
duster, to say nothing of a new and useful vice-
president. By the way, this Immigration League
makes me rather tired. It aims to decoy the
oieign agriculturist to Australia by magic-
lantern shows of the giant pumpkin and grinning
water-melon, and to entice the Anglo-Indian to
rest his curried liver upon the bosom of the Com-
monwealth ; but doesn’t seem to have any ideas
tor providing farms or jobs for the importations,
fk 1S , necessary to join a league to discover
that Australia needs population. A vote cast for
candidates who will toil for a high tariff and pro-
gressive land-taxation is what this country
requires from individuals who bemoan our sheeply
populated fertile areas.—Yours, etc., G. Elburg.
“ J.R.” : The daily papers described Keir
Hardie s farewell speech in Melbourne as “r/u's-
chievous,” which it wasn’t. It was only foolish.
In his inexcusable ignorance, Hardie mistook
the exquisite patent-leather-booted Uni-
versity graduates who gathered round him
in India for a sample of the toiling
millions, and on their information
he said this :
The Government of India is a
military despotism tempered by
civil bureaucracy, and as a
result there are 250,000,000
of its people always hungry.
TI wit’s pretty well the
whole population, and is,
of course, a gross exag-
geration. The British
Government of British
territory is far from per-
fect; hut, if Hardie had
had a chance to see the true
inwardness of things in a
native state, say Sindia’s
country, it would have given
him something to talk about.
In every British province
the cultivator holds under a
permanent settlement with
fixity of tenure, and has the
right to a remission of rent or
land-tax in case of drought or
flood. There is no such right
in Sindia’s country, or Holkar’s,
or any other native State. If a
village is not ready with its
‘‘chout” when the native collector
comes round, it promptly gets a
collective notice to quit, the execu-
tion of which can only be averted
by arrangement between the col-
lector and the village usurer. Old
Henry Lawrence, who was killed at
Lucknow, used to advocate the re-
tention of native States, on the
ground that they taught by contrast the
superiority of British administration.

In royal robes of purple and of red
The sunshine sets the cold grey flags aglow
About the name of her who lies below
The painted windows in her quiet bed.
Here Nelly sleeps, and dreams among the dead
Of her dead lovers. When the bleak winds blow,
Because she trod thee lightly long ago,
Lie lightly, earth, upon her little head.
But when the dawning summer thrills the land
Yield up thy ward beneath the tender moon
And let her tread, amid her spectre band,
To quaint old measures of forgotten tune ;
With gliding foot and whitely-waving hand,
The long-dead dances of her hoyden noon.

The little village of Manly was thrown into a state of
excitement when it learnt of the arrest and exposure of
“ Sir John Marwick, Bart.,” who up till lately was one of
the sights of the place. For the past month he was “ the
idol of the ladies and the envy of the men ” at the seaside
suburb. Manly, of course, was delighted at having a real
live baronet living in the place.”— News item.
Of course, he was a baronet, and so,
When Manly realised that unaware
She had been harboring an angel, oh,
Right quickly shone a halo round his hair !
Our queen of seaside places beamed serenely,
And tendered him a welcome that was queenly.
He was a stranger, but one “ fit to know.”
Of course, his “ bearing ” showed his “ gentle race ” ;
“ Murder will out,” and so will Vere de Vere.
Lines of high breeding dignified his face,
He lent a new tone to the atmosphere.
“ Blood’s speaking in those shapely limbs and torso,”
Said strollers on the Promenade and Corso,
“ THE Baronet ” was lion of the place.
Of course, good fortune often turns the head,
But not in his case ; he was never vain ;
He “ would not journey ” to his grand homestead,
He said most affably, he “ would remain
A Manly man ” ; and womanly approval
Rewarded this denial of removal,
For he was single, and, he thought, should wed.
Of course, the tale he told was rather thin,
But no one questioned his all-sudden rise ;
He lacked not money, and we know that “ tin ”
Makes “ a good fellow ” in most people’s eyes,
Men envied him whom women worshipped daily.
Non est inventus ! willow, willow, waly ;
He was a stranger, and he took them in.
Of course, this doleful hap is nothing new,
For our “ Society ” is over-prone
To deify, where blood is reckoned blue,
To proffer bread, in barter for a stone.
Though often “ done,” it still persists in doing
Over again some act of former ruing.
’Tis Folly’s Flock—a cynic’s sneer, but true.

The more we master the forces of nature, the
more do our chances of accidents multiply, even as the
tamer’s dangers increase in proportion to the number of
wild animals which he “puts through their tricks” in
the cage. Formerly, we avoided the contact of these
forces as much as possible ; to-day, they have gained
admittance to our household. And so, notwithstanding
our more prudent and peaceable manners, it happens to us
more often than to our fathers to look pretty closely upon
death. The South British Insurance Company of 12

While the flags of all nations are known on
the N.S.W. coast, chiefly on vessels pursuing
profitable coal charters from Newcastle, the only
foreigners who seem to get consistently into
trouble are the Norwegians. A couple of years
ago the fine steamer Thordis was unaccountably
wrecked at Port Stephens. Last year the Eido
ran on a well-known and lighted- reef near the
Queensland border. And last week the Thode
Fagelund, a big Norse tramp, ran on -the rocks
near Port Hacking, miles out of its course. Each
disaster was due to ignorance of local conditions.
In the case of the Thode Fagelund the master
seems to have been deceived by the smoke of bush
fires, which blotted out his landmarks. They
don’t have bush fires in Norway—not to any great
extent.
A THING OF DREAD.
"I say! This somnambulism's an awful thing. I wouldn't like to get it, would you! "
"Lord, no! A fellow might get up in the middle of the night and work.”
Magistrate Isaacs, of Sydney, is a popular
old gentleman, and when it became known, the
other day, that he was going to retire, a lady of
many appearances in the dock was moved to tears,
and called down the blessing of Heaven on her
departing friend. The Court, she evidently felt,
would never be the same without him, and she
wouldn’t enjoy being fined by anyone save her old
acquaintance. The magistrate viewed the case
with some embarrassment. There is nothing in
the book of etiquette about “ Magistrate Return-
ing Thanks After Receiving Benediction of
Prisoner,” and he didn’t know exactly what to
say.
“ Edyson ” takes his somewhat belated pen
after a period of slow recovery :
The hot spell that terminated favorably on the night of
January 20 was the most formidable burst of weather
Melbourne has experienced in the memory of the middle-
aged inhabitant. The range of the glass was from 103 to
111 in true shade, and those five days came near to pro-
ducing a marvellous' revolution in men and manners.
Businesses were running up the shutters, theatres were
taking in signs, there was standing room only at the
morgue, and at the hospitals the effort to rescue the
perishing' was rapidly knocking out the City’s supply of
medical men. The cold drink surplus had petered out,
the Yan Yean reservoir was subsiding in an alarming
manner, and ice had jumped from 2s. to 12s.
per cwt. and then vanished in thin air. There was a
moment of imminent and deadly peril when it was
thought the breweries would fail to keep pace with an
almost unanimous thundering demapd for beer. Possibly
it was the result of each man’s eagerness to get his share
of what remained, but certainly Melbourne on the Satur-
day night at 11 o’clock was the tightest city of its size on
the face of the earth. There was nothing like the usual
crowd in the city, but pallid and mirthless inebriety was
in amazing evidence. Between Bourke-street and the
station I did not encounter three men who gave reliable
indications of sobriety.
At this time dire forebodings of calamity cast a thick
heap of gloom over the city, which reeked with the smoke
of bush fires and the taint of the pit, for the murderous
heat of the days had stewed the council’s famous
macadam roads into a bubbling mass, and the very
atmosphere seemed to be tarred an inch deep. Strange
and fearsome insects streamed from the ware-
house cellars and the feedhouse kitchens, and
fled excitedly across the pavement—swarms of them,
with their tails hoisted in the air. They suggested a
spread of the terror even to the creeping things, a grab-
bing of belongings, and a general exodus to the better
land. By Monday at noon there was a pea-green funk
abroad in Melbourne such as cities have felt in the
presence of a plague. The papers had rumored over a
hundred deaths from heat stroke, the glass at Gaunt’s
registered 110° in the shade, and the strongest began to
feel the possibilities of personal disaster in the persistent
oppression of an atmosphere that seemed as tangible as
wool bales.
Men, women and children rolled in the sea. Melbourne,
more prudent and circumspect than Sydney, had barred
mixed bathing, but from Williamstown round, via Port
Melb. and St. Kilda to Black Rock, the bathing
could not have been more mixed or thicker than it was
during those five nights. Neck-to-knee regulations
shrivelled before the popular need. Men and women
bathed in any old thing, or in nothing. Between mid-
night and daylight on Saturday and Sunday bathing in
the altogether was frequent and free within five minutes’
walk of St. Kilda churches, and it provoked no demon-
stration. Melbourne had sunk its Scotchbyterian
respectability, forgotten it in the face of great common
suffering and overwhelming need. Heat levels all, and
the touch of nature that makes the whole world kin is
112 in the shade.
The people of Lome, Victoria’s pet water-
ing-place, woke up one calm morning lately,
looked out the door, and rubbed their eyes hard.
A four-masted barque was sitting bolt upright on
the rocks, near the shore, with most of its canvas
set, and no sign of life aboard. In haste, a boat
put off from Lome, and addressed the stranded
vessel —which proved to be the Hinemoa, of Glas-
gow —and offered the people aboard—who proved
to be below at breakfast—every assistance. The
mariners grinned sheepishly, and said it was very
good of the Lome people, but they didn’t want
any assistance just then. The shore people got
mad, and said the ship was in a dangerous posi-
tion. The mariners, calm and full of breakfast,
said they couldn’t see it. At that, the shore
party told the strangers that they, being resi-
dents, ought to know their own coast, and that
if a south-westerly sprang up, the newly-fed
people of the Hinemoa would be shaken out of
their apathy. The placid crew just pointed with
its united pipe-stem to a sheltered spot close by,
and said that if the worst came it would swim
there. So the shore party, seeing it was im-
possible to make the strangers get excited, rowed
home and wired to Melbourne for a tug to
come and drag the irritating people off their nice
reef. And they were almost mad enough to wish
that a gale would spring up and shake the peace-
ful mariners out of their complacency.
The ass who has a cure for a cold (“ will
fix you up all right, old man; cured mine after I
had tried dozens of things”) and the other ass who
hearkeneth to the bray and fills his stomach with
the stuff recommended by the first ass, reached
the apogee of their asininity at Perth (W.A.) last
week. The one ass recommended spirits of salt
(hydrochloric acid) as a cure; the other took it.
The second ass died slowly in hospital; the
first ass is still free and a danger to his fellow
man. Yet there should be some paddock where
he can get three months’ confinement on thistles
and water.

A painful result of the Druce case and
kindred romances burst upon the sweltering world
of Melbourne last week. John Marwick, till
Romance fired his imagination, was a gardener
at Manly Beach (N.S.W.). There came a day
when he conceived he had inherited “an estate
valued at £lO,OOO a year and securities amounting
to £60,000.” So John chucked gardening and
embarked on the life of the British bart. of news-
paper and other fiction. Cards were printed
with “Sir John Marwick” on them, jewellery
ordered on the 'nod, cigars and cigar-cases
on the same head-bobbing terms, likewise
job-motors. The patron-hungry swimming clubs
(a swimming club would welcome Beelzebub as
vice-president provided he forwarded £2 2s. as a
guarantee of good faith) began to bite, and letters
solicitous of “donations” streamed in from total
strangers, living afar off, and addressed to
“ Baron Jno. Marwick.” Suddenly John went
to Melbourne. How he went doesn’t appear.
He says he arrived there on the Oruba, accom-
panied by a Panhard motor-car ; the probabilities
appear to be in favor of his having walked. He
was in the act of wiring to the Seymour station-
master (who had never heard of him) for the Pan-
hard car he didn’t own, when the hair broke, and
the suspended weapon in the form of a Melbourne
sleuth got him in the neck. He is now doing a
month’s gaol for imposition. A certain pity
surges up for the unhappy John. He is not a
type of the instinctive criminal. It is unlikely
that the motor-drives, or the jewellery, or the
presentations to swimming clubs gave him much
pleasure. Rather than any of those gauds he
would probably have had a glass or two, or three,
of beer. But the gauds were “ necessaries” in his
newand bogus station in life —things without which
any genuine bart. must wilt and die. And so
John sustained a brief period of uneasy riot; and
afterwards stultification, quod, and a ruined
gardening connection. All over the world there
are others, more highly placed, who live up to their
“positions”—at the expense, almost entirely, of
the pettifogging trader. But their pitiful heroism
goes unnoticed.
Anyhow if John was a clumsy fool he seems
to have struck a very clumsy audience of fools.
He began his career at Manly ; it was there he
abandoned the gardening biz. and began to lead
the complicated life in a hotel. He was, it is
said, “the idol of the ladies and the envy of the
men.” He boomed in Manly for a month, and
beamed in his uncouth way on at least one girl as
a prospective husband—his baronial gloss sat upon
him about as gracefully as a camel on a throne.
All this time he might have been bowled out at any
hour of the day or night by anybody who
took the simple precaution of looking up Whit-
aker —a cheap publication which can be found in
any bookshop. There the only Marwick is a
mere knight who used to be town clerk in Glas-
gow, and at another time in Edinburgh. The
fraud was almost as crude as if the gardener had
called himself Earl of Peckham Rye, or Sir Lord
Mayor Smith. Yet apparently it was many
weeks before anybody had the simple but first-
class idea of verifying the alleged bart. A dread-
ful impression begins to spread around that a
large section of society and a multitude of busi-
ness people can’t read.

a small charge between 11 p.m. and 5 a.tn. This
move hasn't been received with loud cheers ; in
fact, it has been received with curses. Anyone
who travels overland from Manly to Sydney can
cross the State ferry at Middle Harbor gratis for
18 hours a day, and the rest of the time he pays
Id. He often uses fearful language about the
penny. Then he goes on to Milson’s Point, and
the early morning Private Enterprise boat of the
Sydney Ferries charges him 6d. to cross to Sydney.
And he doesn’t curse about the 6d. He takes
it as a matter of course because it is Private
Enterprise.

“ Philo ” returns to the attack :
Re your footnote to my paragraph (B. 16/l/’08). My
information re the Jews’ tenacity of life was got from a
much more recent source than Mulhall’s Dictionary of
Statistics quotdfl by you, and my remark did not refer to
the figures of any one particular country, but to the
population of the world in the aggregate, which shows
that the Jews are in the habit of living something between
40 and 50 per cent, longer than the Christians. In
America, however, spite of the morbid social conditions
which surround most of the Jews of the big cities, it is
estimated that the death-rate among the Jewish inhabi-
tants is about half the average American rate. This
statement is supported by Professor William Z. Ripley in
his papers in the Popular Science Monthly. According
to this writer, if two groups of 100 infants each, one of
Jewish and one of average American parentage, be born
upon the same day, one half of the Americans will die
within 47 years, while the Jewish half will not succumb
to disease before the expiration of 71 years. A other
writer, Lombroso, estimates that, of 1000 Jews born, 217
die before the age of seven years, while 453 Christians —
more than twice as many—usually die within the same
period. Some of this discrepancy may be ac-
counted for by the immunity of the Jews from acci-
dent because of their indoor occupations, but this
very fact should make them more liable to epidemic and
other diseases. Yet statistics show an abnormally small
proportion of deaths from consumption and pneumonia.
And this is ascribed by Professor Ripley to the excellent
system of meat inspection prescribed by the Mosaic law.
An Englishman, Professor Hoffman, supports this with
the statement that as much as one-third of the meats
offered for sale in London are rejected as unfit for con-
sumption by the Jewish killers.
The Bulletin regards this information as a trifle
startling. If, out of 1000 Jews born on a certain
day, the first 500 doesn’t die off for 71 years, when
does the second 500 die, and what is the average
age of the lot? And if, out of 1000 American
infants the first 500 doesn’t finish dying for 47
years, then the American seems to have a dread-
fully long start of the mere bulk Gentile of Lom-
broso alluded to in “ Philo’s” next paragraph. For
if out of 1000 Gentile infants 453 die in the first
seven years, that only leaves, according to the
American computation, 47 to die in the next 40
years, which looks a very low percentage. These
things may be all right, but they certainly appear
rather startling at first sight.

Janor : From a sketch of Seven Dials
by Charles Dickens
Every post in the open space has its occupant, who
leans against it for hours with listless perseverance. It
is odd enough that one class 6f then in London appear to
have no enjoyment beyond Yeahing against posts VVe
never saw a regular bricklajH rh laborer take any other
recreation, fighting excepted. ' Pass through St. Giles’s
on the evening of a week-day; there they are leaning
against posts. Walk through ’Seven Dials on Sunday
morning, there they are again, leaning against posts.
The idea of a man dressing himself in his best clothes to
lean against a post all day 1
bo, after all, the post-habit, which Australians
are now and again accused of indulging in, is
hereditary, and is merely a silken bond or a
crimson thread, or some other old tie of Empire.

“ Hassan ” : One result of the Wallace
divorce case is a great increase of caution in the
medical profession in Melbourne. A lady called
in to see a doctor the other day. Her trouble was
a sprained instep. Pale but determined the
doctor bent down, and, gingerly touching the
painful spot without removing the shoe, advised
his astounded patient to go home and rest. She
asked him whether he didn’t want her to take her
shoe off. He shuddered, and sternly replied that
he was quite satisfied as to the nature of the in-
Another damsel of a frolic disposition sailed
into the surgery of a fearfully respectable doctor
with the alarming request that he should “strap
her foot.” He looked upon her austerely, and
suggested that a chaperon would be necessary.
She laughed a laugh of nie.rry scorn, and turned
to leave. He grew angry and emphatic when he
saw how this mere “flapper” had pulled his
august leg, and remarked acidly that if she were
his daughter it 'wouldn’t be her foot that would
get strapped, and then the door of the interview
slammed.

has partly stopped the break with wads of

end, the biggest joke ever worked on a public
y ranspires. Just there dwells a German
farmer who, up to 1899, paid £5 a year for

water to irrigate his farm. At that date he noticed
the leak, so he cancelled his £5 contract, and set
to work to utilise the waste water. Since then he
has built two reservoirs, which have been filled to
the brim, has dug chains of irrigation channels,
and has actually carried the overflow in pipes
across the valley to a block of land he has
there. His only grief is that he hasn’t enough
land to utilise all the water, and is forced to see
some of it run to waste. As an irrigationist he is
the very man to teach the Rodney farmers the
value of using water; but those Melbourne
citizens who are now compelled to curtail their con-
sumption because the supply threatens to give out
any day, are less inclined to consider the beauties
ot irrigation than to belt sense into the Board of

Bents Cabinet is just now pondering
whether to speak firmly to Vic, Railway Boss
toar 0r et klm bis own way. In January,
1905, sparks from a passing engine set fire to
three holdings in Trawalla district, and did
damage on Coongham, Trawalla, and Langi Kal
Kal estates to the tune of £4400, £3OOO, and £7lB
respectively. The Langi Kal claim was sent to
arbitration under the Railways Act. The arbi-
trator decided against the Commissioners ; but
those obstreperous persons, having money to
burn, appealed first to the Full Court, then to the
High Court. Both upheld the arbitrator’s
decision. The award has now been paid ; but as
Langi s owner has a bill for £l2OO costs to meet,
he is considerably worse off than when he started.
The trouble now is that the Commissioners,
though beaten thrice in what was supposed to be
a test case, decline to pay the other claims, and
threaten to carry both of them right up to the
High Court. As that not only means a certain
dead loss to the owmers, but a further monu-
mental bill of Costs for the State. Bent and co.
are thinking hard. Of course, Tait’s game is
bluff ; and Bent, who is himself an expert at that
amusement, apparently doesn’t like to spoil
another man’s fun.

Schopenhauer’s theory of the transcen-
dental origin of love—that it is quite with-
out reason, and is due to a mad impulse im-
parted by the unborn souls wishing to get born—
had some illustration in last week’s cables which
chronicled the madness of a chauffeur who fell in
love with a princess, and because he couldn’t have
her cried to kill her, her husband, and himself.
He succeeded only in making a corpse of
himself. The proceedings throughout were utterly
unreasonable as they couldn’t bring him any nearer
to his object. One of the Sydney papers gave as
anotner instance of the “madness of love,” the
fact that a man with £3,750,000 has married a
beautiful shepherdess with nothing but her face
as a fortune. But that bridegroom was surely
wiser than if he married an ugly millionairess.
With £3,750,000 he caii keep the wolf from biting

Australia hasn’t produced many horrors to
equal a recent episode in the Associated mine at
Kalgoorlie (W.A.). There were two men below,
and the usual charge, and the very common pre-
mature explosion. No one, bar the pair below,
knew that anything had gone wrong, and it was a
little time before some men went down. Then
they were horrified to find something that looked
like the wrath of God —something horribly
mangled and inhuman and with both eyes blown
out —wandering round in circles on all fours near
the plat. Yet the hero hadn’t come to complain of
his own injuries, though they were such that he had
almost lost the outward semblance of a man ; what
he wanted to report was that his mate was insensible
and, he feared, dead. As it happened, the mate
wasn’t dead—in fact, he was the less damaged of the
two. John Watson is the plain, matter-of-fact
name of the hero who dragged the wreck of him-
self along the drive to get first aid for his partner.
It was the sort of unassuming act for which no'
Victoria Cross is given, and it is as well that the
gaud isn’t given. Even if the cross was as big as
that one that was humped out of Jerusalem by
Simon the Cyrenian it wouldn’t meet the case.

Australian press correspondents to tjie
British newspapers help, perhaps unwittingly,
the Stinking Fish Party in their eagerness for
piquant news. The Daily Chronicle’s cable
from its Melbourne correspondent, that “hun-
dreds of thousands of people were seriously ill,
owing to the heat,” was a silly and mischievous
exaggeration. The last Melbourne heat wave,
the most serious, probably, that was ever
recorded in Australia, speeded the deaths of a
few weaklings, but that was all. If it had struck
the Gulf country, it wouldn’t have done that,
for the northerner is acclimatised; but Melbourne
is a bleak city for several months in the year, and
a cool one for several more months, and its people
never get a chance —any more than the New
Yorkers do—to get really lit for the rare experi-
ence when the lid of Hell is temporarily mislaid.

One hundred years ago this week lively
things were happening in Bridge-street, Sydney.
McArthur and Blaxland and the rest were firing
in their memorandum to Major Johnston begging
him to depose Governor Bligh, and Bligh was being
arrested in, his bedroom. Nobody will ever know
for sure whether he was hiding under his bed,
or (as lie alleges) was merely on the secluded
side of it destroying papers that he didn’t want
the McArthur faction to get hold of. Two
soldiers did the formal arresting, and they after-
wards told different yarns about the bed,
so the matter is held up till the Day of
Judgment; and on the Day of Judgment
most people will be too busy about their
own affairs to worry about Bligh’s. Anyhow,
the Governor came out all right; Johnston was
cashiered, and Bligh was made an Admiral.
Bligh’s chief crime was that he couldn’t properly
appreciate the big men’s land-grabbing of those
days. Then they named Bligh-street after him,
and, ninety years later, Fate or the Devil or
something, by way of revenge, made Bligh-street
the head-quarters of the agents whose cheerful
ways led up to the Lands Scandals.
“ Adelaide ” : I deny enthusiastically that
the S. A. youth “ regularly uses ‘ crook ’ to signify
‘boshter,” as stated by “Sr.” (B. 9/l/'08). His
own example gives him away. “Clem. Hill’s
crook, ain't ’e? I’ll bet yer a hundred he’s better’n
Trumper.” Does “ Sr.” (which I understand to
be short for Senator) never hear the rhetorical
question or the ironical statement used in the
Senate? “Crook,” as applied to a cricketer,
“t; mean Not trying, or Unfit to play. The
Adelaide nipper evidently was repudiating the
former condition on Hill’s behalf; or; admitting
him unfit—which he was, to the point of being
violently unwell in public—would still hold him
better than Victor T.—whioh he was, also. Crude
sarcasm is a favorite weapon of the.ordinary hoy.
t seems to take the form .of the plain negative
nowadays. Thus the Yankee hoy’s most awful
threat is, ‘ When I catch him, I won’t do a thing
to him ! ” r.
The paragraph about the remote French
town that had been “ruined by Socialism” was
still wandering around Australian newspapers,
and Tories were still using it as a foundation for
cursing State interference, when Newcastle
(N.S.W.) reported that some more of that town
had been ruined by Private Enterprise. There
has been so little of the curse of State interference
at Newcastle that the coal cos. have gouged out
great caverns under the city, and have left a
mere shell between it and Sheol. As they gouged
out the coal they retreated, and now water has
filled the Old workings, and time and moisture
have weakened the roof of the old cavern, and
right in the centre of Newcastle you are therefore
liable to wake up now to find the washstand out
of plumb, and the looking-glass piled by a sudden
jerk on top of the wardrobe. A few months ago
there was a collapse which splintered some of the
finest residences on “the hill”; now there has
been another collapse of the thin shell into the
old caverns, and the Anglican Cathedral is a
wreck, and fine business premises within 200
yards of the central railway station are torn and
twisted. Between the two movements Premier
Wade was implored to supply Newcastle with some
of that State interference which is vaguely alleged
to have ruined the remote French town; but
Wade can only reply that Private Enterprise did
the ruin so thoroughly that the State can’t do
anything now except appoint a “Royal” Com-
mission and ask the Church and the others to bear
this latest blessing of Private Enterprise in a
Christian spirit.

London, Jan. 21. —Mr. Theodore Schlumberger, a
German Deputy, possessing- a fortune of £3,750,000,
has married a beautiful shepherdess, whom he met near
Basle, Switzerland. His sons vainly offered her £18,750
to break the engagement.— Daily paper.
Oh ! a little romance is an excellent thing
When a person is youthful and spry,
For the world only grins at a bird on the wing
As it winks its experienced eye.
The follies of life are the food of the .young,
And it causes nobody distress
If a young man should look
At a housemaid or cook,
Or make eyes at a gay shepherdess
(More or less !)
An impertinent, gay shepherdess.
Ah ! a little romance is a terrible thing
When a person is wealthy and old,
When an elderly person starts having his fling
With his houses, his land, ahd his gold.
When, instead of his will, he is making the pace,
Oh ! it causes his heirs much distress,
When he struts and he stares,
With his hat on three hairs •,
Arm-in-arm with a young shepherdess
(More or less !)
His affectionate, good shepherdess.

This bank, which is just putting the finishing touches to
a two-storied crown at its head offioe, has added £19,975
to its premises account during the half-year—“ less than
the amount expended on new premises account, but we
have written off a large amount,” the directors say ; in
other words, they have paid for the balance out of profits
which are not shown as such. Taking that into account,
along with the fact that the officers have just had a
bonus, the result of the half-year’s work was apparently
even finer than it looks on paper. (Apropos of that officers’
bonus, this bank treats its staff better, perhaps, than any
other big bank in Australia—and the staff knows it.)
But as to the profits, it is just as well to remember now
and again that bank profits are not exactly like
a grocer’s profits. Interest earnings are not paid in cash,
but are mostly represented by an addition to the amount
of the advance ; and if the security presently peters out,
then not only the principal, but what has hitherto
appeared to be profit, peters out also. The reliance that
can be placed upon the reported profits of a bank,
especially in times of prosperity and high values, mainly
therefore depends upon the sort of bank it is—its reputa-
tion, its record, and so on. The prudent bank, realising
the true nature of the business, makes these good
times provide for the poor ones that are bound
to happen; but there are banks that haven’t
always been prudent. This particular bank, however,
showed lately that it still deserved its old reputation
by issuing ne w capital at a premium—a most proper thing
to do in order to provide further security for the in-
creased deposits, etc. As for the shareholder, what the
reputation is from his point of view may best be gauged
by the fact that the report just issued is the 119th, and
only once has no dividend been paid. For many years it
was 25 p.c. ; but that was a mistake, and the bank
learned its lesson.

The liabilities to the public total £17,628,773, and no
less than 52 per cent, of that is represented by liquid
assets. The recently very profitable business of lending
on short call in London has, however, eased off ; the total
was £445,000 on Dec. 31 as against £1,310,400 twelve
months ago. The low prices of public securities has been
taken advantage of to invest the surplus money that way,
and that ought presently to mean a big profit. Owing to
this policy of holding such a large proportion of liquid
assets the earnings are comparatively small, notwith-
standing the -very large amount of the public’s money
with which the bank is favored. Recent declared profits
represent the following return on capital and reserves
oombined: —

The figures for the last couple of terms have been dis-
turbed by the inflow of the new capital, and the com-
parison is affected more or less.

After the crisis of 1892-3 it was decided to try to save this
bank from liquidation. Probably, if the real value of the
assets had been known, this would never have been at-
tempted. The crux of the arrangement was to make the
future pay for the past—to atone for years of drunken
profligacy by years of laborious asceticism. There were
three main features in the scheme of salvation—(l) the
calling up, followed by the wholesale writing-down, of
ordinary capital; (2) the cutting down of the interest on
old deposits to 3 per cent. (£2,117,230 was converted into
pref. shares, carrying a maximum 4 per cent.); (3) the
making good of old losses out of new profits. To help in
the last-named process—“ in order not to obscure the new
bank’s earning power ” —the most disastrous of the old
business was turned over to an Assets Trust. That drafting
out of the goats was a good idea, which the A. J.S. in par-
ticular ought to have followed ; for it allowed the public
to look at and be impressed by a vigorous and prudent
new bank, and not merely view a vast mixed heap of old
and new business. Even David Jones, Ltd., couldn’t sell
its choice fal-lals if it bought out half-a-dozen Goulburn-
street old clo-’ men, and bundled the seven stocks in one
great pile.
The new bank had, however, to guarantee the
Trust’s liabilities. (These liabilities consisted of old
bank’s deposits.) For many years the new directors,
disclaiming responsibility for the old mess, refused to
even commit themselves to a valuation of the Trust’s
assets. In 1901 a new general manager did it. His
valuation and the subsequent proceedings are shown
hereunder: —
Dec. ’Ol. June ’O7. Dec. ’O7.
Liabilities of Trust.. £3,334,903 £2,616,751 £2,508,214
Assets of Trust .. 1,800,000 1,230,000 1,120,000
Deficit of Trust ..£1,534,903 £1,386,751 £1,388,214
Less Bank Reserves.. 27,619 247,488 267,406
Net Deficit .. ..£1,507,284 £1,139,263 £1,120,808
The valuation was probably on a conservative basis :
anyhow, the present management has nothing to gain by
making the valuations high, and it has something to gain
by making them low. Twelve months ago the chairman
stared that the Trust in five years had sold £479,566 of assets
at £24,186 over the new valuation. This “ profit,” however,
has never been included in the published figures. Evi-
dently the manager treats it as an internal reserve to
protect his valuation. During the past year realisations
have been pretty rapid ; yet they have not reduced the
deficit. Under ordinary circumstances this would mean
that the sales have not come up to the valuation ; but, in
view of the fact that a profit was achieved previously and
not shown, it is obvious that things in connecti’on with
this business are not always what they seem. They are
likely to be better rather than worse. For instance, what
becomes of the discount at which the old deposits are
bought? Obviously if the assets are realising £ for £ of
the valuation, they must be paying off more than £ for £
of the debt, seeing that the old deposits can be got for
about 17s.
The most cheerful features of the case are the
growth of banking profit, and the decrease in the demand
for help on the Trust’s part

This double movement will hasten the filling up of the
vast hole on the premises. That hole, as shown above, is
£1,120,808, taking the general manager’s estimate as a
datum point. The aid to the Trust is the difference
between the net earnings of the assets and the interest on
the old deposits. Practically, it is the interest on the
deficit; and as the deficit is reduced the interest upon it
will be reduced. Even, however, if £45,000 a year were
available to w’ipe out the deficit it would take 25 years to
do it. What a Drunk it was !

The new debt to the public is £5,280,782, and the liquid
assets represent no less than 54 p.c. of the total. For
ordinary purposes such a proportion is quite unnecessary.
Possibly there may be some scheme in view to steadily
build up the liquid resources, paying off all or part of the
old deposits (due in 1916) out of them, and possibly
writing down the capital, so as to square the balance-
sheet, while proportionately raising the rate of interest.
But that is only supposition. Still it is pretty certain
that the bank won’t be content to let the present under-
taker’s job drag on for close upon 30 years.

After the Great Drunk the truth as to this bank was not
told for four years. Then, in 1897, the old make-believe
reconstruction was set aside and a new one arranged.
The Government, whose funds had been so shamefully
misused, was to receive £1,374,995 of its total debt (that
is, three-fourths) in five equal annual instalments from
1917 onwards, the debt to carry 3£ per cent. ; the other
£458,331 was to be paid out of profits, and was to carry
no interest. The private depositors were treated in the
same way, except that the deposit stock issued against
the first three-fourths of their debt was made intermin-
able. In 1904 Kidston re-arranged matters with the bank.
He agreed to take repayment of the debt to the Govern-
ment in 16 annual instalments, the unpaid balance to
carry £2 12s. 6d. per cent, interest; and instead of the
Government taking 25 per cent, of the net profits, the
private depositors’ repayment fund takes that as well as
its old 50 per cent. ; also, when eight of the instalments
are paid, a 3J per cent. div. may go to shareholders.
But this dividend can only come out of the 25
per cent, of the net profit until the debt to the old
depositors is wiped out ; and, as the following shows,
there is still £885,974 of that to be got rid of

The first P.N. to repay the Government did not fall due
till 1910, but so far that and four others have been paid,
leaving 11 outstanding ; and three more must be paid
before a div. can arrive. Whether it ought to arrive then
is quite another matter. So long as one penny of deposi-
tors’ money is unavailable, shareholders’ capital ought
strictly to be regarded as non-existent. The public
is, however, to blame if things are not done in
that way ; for the depositors in this case are
keenly interested in cultivating new business ; and in
estimating the value of a bank, people with new business
at command nearly always fight shy of the one that isn’t
paying dividends.
Some further comparisons follow :

Premises, etc. .. 278,400 277,779 Dec. 621
Though on these figures the balance-sheet totals should
be about £790,000 more than they were 12 months ago,
as a matter of fact they fall a good deal short of that.
First of all, £172,195 has been repaid to the Government.
But there has also been a remarkable reduction of the
“ Debts in suspense,” described as “ private ledger
accounts.” In six months these have been reduced
by £162,517; and that probably explains in part
how the large amounts have been paid off the old
Government debt without seriously affecting the other
figures. How the realisation of the old securities is
progressing it is impossible to tell; yet not only the con-
ditions of Queensland, but the late Government’s land
settlement policy must have helped it along greatly. The
visible hole is still certainly tremendous. The debt to
private depositors payable out of profits is £885,974 ; and
of the £1,033,172 of debt to the State, presumably some
of it is not represented by assets, otherwise the bank has
no right to be paying the State only £2 12s. 6d. for the
money. To fill these holes up out of profits would be a
matter of very many years—about 30 at the recent rate—
but recoveries have to be kept in mind. On that point,
however, it is just as well to remember that the drought
and the pastoral losses were blamed for more than they
should have been. The committee of 1896, whose report
led to the reconstruction of 1897, split up the estimated
losses in this way :
Pastoral.. .. £506,059 = 14'47 per cent.
Agricultural .. 243,542= 6 '96 „
Commercial .. 1,243,043 = 35-54 ~
Mining .. .. 773,329 = 22-11 „
Miscellaneous .. 731,830 = 20-92 ~
£3,497,803= 100
So the estimated pastoral and agricultural losses didn’t
bulk so large, and hence we need nofc expect anything
very tremendous in the way of recoveries on account ot
the new pastoral and agricultural prosperity.

This bank continues to show increasing profits; the
growth has heen larger than one would expect from the
increase in the figures as to advances, etc. But some of
the best of the banks, even those which had a cleaning-up
after the troubles, hung on to a good deal of doubtful
business, and trusted to the future to put it right. In
the last few years conditions have been very good to these
banks, and, 'though the figures may not have increased
much, the assets represented by those figures have
charmed a lot. That is one reason why, though this bank s
advances in the last half of 1895 were £6,075,829, the
profits were only £20,631, while advances of £5,796,354
now bring in a profit of £49,921. Latterly, however
there has been a considerable actual increase in some of
the figures:—

But it is doubtful whether all of the increase in advances
shown by some banks as at December 31 last is permanent.
Marketsfor Australian products have been slack, and at the
tail-end of last year there were signs of an improvement; so
the banks had more money than usual out against extra-
ordinary stocks of wool, etc. Still, allowing for that,
this bank’s advances have grown substantially—which
ought to mean extra profits, and which certainly mean
extra risks, especially when advances are made on the
basis of such high prices for products as have ruled
lately. Free deposits are less ; that mostly explains the
shrinkage in liquid assets. The latter still represent a
pretty substantial 31 per cent, of liabilities to the public.
These liabilities are not quite four times greater than the
capital and reserves ; in other words, for £1 of their own
money, the shareholders have the use of fatherless than
£4 of the public’s ; and, provided the assets are reason-
ably good—in other words, assuming the shareholders’
£1 is there —this low proportion of liabilities means safety
for depositors, etc. On the other hand, it means com-
paratively low earnings. On capital and reserves com-
bined, profits show:
June, 1904 .. £4 4 4 p.c. June, 1906 .. £4 9 11 p.c.

Of the bank’s capital of £1,478,010, £416,760 is 5 p.c. pre-
ference, with full participation in profits beyond 5 p.c. ;
but the preference ceases when 10 half-yearly divs. of 7
p.c. or more have been paid.

From the outside the Royal of Queensland looks a curious
mixture. From the fact that it pays away almost all of
the profit it shows, and adds a most miserable lot to re-
serves, it might be judged to be a prodigal, with no
thought for the morrow. Yet, though its own capital
and funds are already half as big as the total debt to the
public, it goes on increasing its share capital at every op-
portunity. But in the issue of this new capital at par it
is handicapped by the fact that the public can get
old capital at a discount. Still, the new capital
strengthens the position from the depositor’s point
of view, and, it would seem, lays sure foundations
for a bigger business in the future. In a sense, the
bank is handicapped too by confining itself strictly to
Queensland; it has no branch outside that State, and,
somehow, deposits don’t seem to be available in any
great quantity in Queensland. That State suffers a lot
from absenteeism ; even the Queenslander himself, when
he has got his pocket full, has a habit of coming down to
the southern flesh-pots, and bringing the contents of his
pockets with him. So this bank, with capital and reserves
of £545,657, has deposits amounting to only £1,075,710,
and its total liabilities are only £1,118,598. If it had the
use of as much in proportion as the three big banks of
Sydney, it Vould owe about £3,900,000, instead of
£1,118,598. Of course it is a question whether all of the
capital and reserves is intact. The investing public has
its doubts, for the shares (£6105.) paid are quoted at about
£4 15s. But even writing the shareholders’ interest down
to that, the public’s money in the concern amounts to
only £3 2s. for every £1 of the shareholders’ interest.
The earnings on the basis of capital and reserves are
therefore poor:—
June, 1904.. £3 10 7 p.c. June, 1906.. £3 16 4 p.c.
Dec., 1904.. 313 5 „ Dec., 1906.. 4 211 „
June, 1905.. 314 1 ~ June, 1907.. 4 5 5 ~
Dec., 1905.. 315 7 „ Dec., 1907.. 412 7 „
The progress is, nevertheless, marked ; and yet
not as marked as one might expect from the progress of
Queensland, and especially that part of Queensland where
this bank does most of its business. A reasonable
assumption is that it has been writing down over-valued
assets from the inside. The theory of the management
appears to be that, while there are over-valued assets,
additions to reserves would be fictitious, because
all the reserves are fictitious so long as capital
is not represented by assets. Instead, however, of
writing off capital, it has apparently made up its mind,
having gone this far, to nurse and feed the assets up to
the full value of 20s. in the £ again ; and while that is in
progress, the real value of the current business is hidden.

But it is quite possible that the quality of the advances
shows more change during the last few years than the
figures themselves do. Still the figures themselves are
not standing still : at the end of 1903 the advances
totalled £996,869, or £214,919 less than they do now.
Yet the Royal of Queensland is not rushing things, and
in a country of such rapid changes there is a lot of wisdom
in that. The cash position is as usual strong ; nearly 36
per cent, of the liabilities are represented by liquid assets.

This venerable co., “established by Act of Council, 8
William 1V.,” hasn’t become garrulous with old age.
It gives no hint as to what provision it is making for
depreciation ; and if it is making profits and stuffing
them away in new works it isn t mentioning the fact.

Assuming that the same proportion of revenue was
written off in both terms, it is obvious that the under-
taking is much more profitable now than it was ; and it
looks highly probable that part at least of that improve-
ment is due to the fact that profit-earning works have
been provided and paid for out of revenue, so that the
actual additions to the works have been much larger than
the balance-sheet figures suggest. Another possible ex-
planation is that in these six years Federation has cast
such a gloom over Sydney that people have to burn more
gas than thev used to ; also “ Father of 17£ ” and “ True
Liberal ” are liable nowadays to wake up in the middle of
the night and light up in order to look for another State
Grievance. The Bulletin, however, prefers to believe
that the improvement in the figures is due (1) to the ex-
tension of mains, etc., which have been paid for out of
profits ; and (2) to the general prosperity under the pre-
viously mentioned Curse. The return on fixed invest-
ment, as shown above, is at the rate of £lO 10s.
2d. per cent, per annum; the profit shown by
the Melbourne co. is only £6 Is. 3d. per cent, on
the same basis. But there is this difference:
the Melbourne co.’s expenses include about £41,000
a year interest on £848,000 of debentures. The Sydney
co.’s entire liabilities amount to only £371,091. But it
shows “suspense accounts, £71,807,” an item that is
rapidly mounting. In 12 months £9502 has been added
to it. Probably this will turn out to be some sort of a
reserve, and the additions made to it are so much extra
profit. For many years the premium capital was lumped
in with these suspense accounts, and that pretty well in-
dicates their nature.

The reserves are made up this‘way : —Premium capital,
£466,535 ; formal reserve fund, £82,790; meter renewal
fund, £21,240; undivided profit, £2624. The amount
shown in the table as written off for the half-year consists
of £2238 charged to the meter renewal fund and £3OOO
carried to gas stoves account. The amount for which
gas stoves are hired out doesn’t quite pay the co. for cost
of up-keep, etc.; but to encourage the use of stoves—and
incidentally the consumption of gas—the co. makes up
the balance of the cost in this way. It is really a bonus
paid to stove-users for burning the chops with gas instead
of coal. Besides the amount showrn as written off, re-
pairs and maintenance to the amount of £31,838 were
paid for out of revenue direct. The total outlay on this
account for the year was £61,069, or about 2J per cent, on
the total amount spent on the undertaking and charged
to capital account. But, besides the amount charged to
capital account, large sums have been spent on new
works and paid for out of revenue. The total for 1907
was £29,302, and for the past five years £105,921. That,
of course, may be only a set-off against depreciation of
other plant ; in other . ords, a main may be extended
half-a-mile down Ermyntrude Avenue to counterbalance
the year’s rust of the old mains in tne ancient neighboring
Smith Road. At the same time, large sums are being
provided out of revenue to repair and renew the Smith
Road and other mains ; so it is more than probable that
a large amount of the revenue put into new works is
really a disguised reserve. That, no doubt, partly ex-
plains this: —
Total charged to Return on
Capital account. Capital.
Dec.,’o2 .. £2,152,788 £4 13 9 per cent.
Dec.,’o7 .. 2,149,842 6 1 3
Thus, in spite of the extensions made during the past
five years, the book-value of the undertaking is actually
less than it was in 1902 (which means that it has
been written down out of profits) ; and at the same time,
the profit-earning capacity on the basis of book-value has
gone up £1 7s. 6d. per cent, per annum. In the light of
that fact, much notice need not be taken of the other
fact that the formal reserves, after paying the 10 per
cent, dividend, have remained almost stationary. On
the outside, it looks as if the dividends were being barely
earned, in spite of the prosperous times ; but there are
obvious reasons why the outside of gas cos’, accounts
shouldn’t be made to look too gaudy.

This co., which has about the finest thing in Australia
while it lasts, is virtually the sole connecting link
between Sydney and the great and growing population
on the North Shore. The present co., registered in 1899,
was a reconstruction of an earlier co., and represented a
100 per cent, watering. That is to say, each £1 share in
the old co. carried two £1 shares in the new. Since then,
there have been other waterings, bringing the register up
from 120,000 to 199,972 shares ; so what is nominally a 10
per cent, dividend is really a great deal more than that.
Of the present shares, 160,000 are fully paid ; the other
39,972 are paid to 10s. only. The paid shares are quoted
(seller) at 585.; the 10s. paid are quoted at 495. At 585., the
old shares return £3 9s. per cent.; at 495., the new shares
bring in under £2 Is. per cent. A daily paper list has
for weeks past been giving the latter return as 3j per
cent. ; but it is, of course, nothing of the kind. Even
when the 10s. is called up, the return on these new shares
will be under 3£ per cent. In the expectation, then, of
being able to get a bigger bite out of the public, investors
are willing to pay for this stock a price which yields at
present nearly 50 per cent, less than the return they
require from the public stock of the State !
And what are the prospects of their getting
What they expect? Well, here is one comparison :

The disclosed profit isn’t very much ahead of the present
div. ; but it seems likely that there are profits which are
not disclosed. In the six months £5788 has come off the
item “ ships.” That means either that there have been
sales, or that the item has been written down that much
out of unmentioned profits. There is no whisper of sales ;
on the contrary, there is mention of very extensive altera-
tions and additions to the boats. Not only have these
been paid for out of revenue, but, besides, £5788
has been written off, it seems. Theoretically, this
is provision for depreciation. Perhaps! By way of
making provision for ‘the day when the North Shore
bridge will be built, the co. has stretched out an eager
paw and laid hold of many choice picnicking places about
the harbor; hence the size of the “ Land, etc.” item.
This investment probably doesn’t yield a high return ;
but it is a sort of insurance policy. Also, as to these
picked pieces of Harbor foreshores, Unearned Increment
is pulling in the Sydney Ferries’ boat, and Sydney will
only have itself to thank if it gets pinched by and bye.

A copper smelting furnace, designed to embody
the recommendations of the best Australian and American
experts, has just been constructed for the Great Fitzroy
Gold and Copper Mines Ltd., Queensland. The furnace is
of large capacity, being capable of turning out 100 tons of
matte per day. It is rectangular in shape, and is higher
in column in proportion to its heartli area than is
customary. By this means both the roasting and
oxidising operations will be conducted in the same furnace,
the oxidising being done in the upper portion and the
smelting in the lower. The furnace has two tiers of mild
steel water jackets. The lower tier rests on a c.i. plate,
supported on c.i. standards, or, should hearth plate be
removed, the tier will be swung on girders ; the upper
tier of jackets is always swung from girders supported on
columns. The columns are held together by a strong c.i.
frame. The air blast passes from a pipe encompassing
the furnace through Hustle pipes to the tuyeres. The
Austral Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne,
have designed and built this furnace.* [1

The Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. (Sydney)
made last year a profit of £43,597, of which it wrote off
£1893 from machinery, transferred £B2O to building'
sinking- fund, paid £33,537 by way of dividend and bonus
and carried forward. The paid capital is now
£133,100, so div. and bonus are nominally 25 per cent. •
but £16,900 (the bonus) may be taken in shares which
£lO paid, are worth £7O. The reserves, after paying the
present div. and bonus, will be £79,806. This includes
£14,175, the amount by which machinery was written up
during the year. This is an extraordinary proceeding.
Apparently for the purpose of disguising profits, plant
has hitherto been charged to working account; now
when the shares are in general circulation, and it is reck-
oned desirable not only to do well, but to also appear
to do well, the hitherto suppressed figures are added in.
The authorised capital of £150,000 will be completed by
the present issue of shares ; and, to make room for more
water in the future, it is now proposed to increase the
authorised capital to £250,000. At the present market
value of shares (say £7O), the concern, before the new
issue, is worth £931,700. This is represented as follows

Bank of England discount rate, which was up
to 7 per cent, a few weeks ago, has had a rapid fall to 4
per cent.—the most rapid for 30-odd years—and the New
York money market is also much easier. English gilt-
edged stocks have moved up fast; British Consols sprang
nearly 305., and Australian Government and bank stocks
have also risen a few steps. Several Australian banks
either bought Consols during the late slump or already
held them and wrote them down out of profit, and there
is a good margin already made. On the other hand, the
brief days are past when Australian banks could lend
their current account balances at short call in London,
getting high rates for money which they don’t generally
use at all. If Australian banks showed all their past 18
months’ profit (which in most cases is unlikely), a
shrinkage now would be inevitable.

In case Philp, of Queensland, has missed it.
The Bulletin directs his attention to a daily paper para-
graph, published last week, notifying that Westralia had
been negotiating with Melbourne people for some days,
and had finally offered £500,000 worth of 3£ per cent, de-
bentures at 97 ; and the Melbourne people turned the pro-
posal down promptly. More than one Australian
Treasurer has had the idea that Melbourne and Sydney
are waiting to rush State loans ; but Westralia, in spite
of its substantial sinking fund, has found out that the
alleged rush is a myth. There is some money to invest in
State loans ; but the men with the money won’t buy new
stock when they can get the same return from old stock.
They don’t want watered securities and second mortgages,
and that is what new stock amounts to.

Chairman Phil Morton went a foot or so further
into details at the A.J.S. Bank meeting in Sydney, and
said that “ the current advance business, less about
£3500, is estimated to be all safe and readily convertible
into cash ” ; and as the current advance business runs to
£2,260,103, the remark only strengthens the view that
the A.J.S. business is worth saving, and that it can’t
be saved by letting things drift. The old ad-
vances have lately been overhauled, and the directors
“are quite satisfied further losses will have to
be provided for,” but “the difficulty of valuing”
such varied assets sticks the management up, and
it can’t say what the further losses are. In other words,
the bank doesn’t know where it is ; and a bank that
doesn’t know where it is had better try to find out with-
out loss of time. Apropos the vast premises account,
which has been “ the subject of some comment,” the
Brisbane property (valued at £31,500) stands in the books
at £7253, while the head office stands at £75,050, “ or
about £25,000 less than the value of the land without the
building.” The Br.sbane case at least has been pretty
well known for a long while ; but what does it all prove,
anyway ? Simply that the bank has got an overcoat
about 11 sizes too large for it; and in a case of that kind
the quality of the stuff in the overcoat is a secondary
matter.

For the first time the Broken Hill cos. that
haven’t smelters of their own really have trouble in sell-
ing their concentrates. Yet even now the trouble would
not have been heard of but for the fact that the German
ore-buyers have large stocks of leady concentrates on
hand for which they paid considerably more than £l4 ;
and, as they don’t want to realise till the price of lead
recovers a little, they are doing their best to nurse the
market back to strength. The Australian (German) Metal
Co. alone has 50,000 tons of concentrates stacked
at Port Pirie, and doesn’t seem in any hurry to shift the
heap. Under the circumstances, the recent conference
between the Ore Sellers’ Association and the B. H. Prop, re-
sembled a six-handed game of euchre, in which the B. H.
Prop, held both bowers and the joker. General
Manager Delprat was the joker. No card that the
ore-sellers could play was likely to take a trick. What
worried them most was the demand for a five years’
supply of concentrates, and they seem very determined
not to bind themselves to anything of that kind. Yet
the only way for the ore-sellers to get out of that diffi-
culty is for them to put up the £40,060 which the increase
in the B. H. Prop, smelting plant will cost. The foreign
ore-buyers, on their part, seem confident of getting
the Broken Hill concentrates just as soon as they want
them.
* • • *
The Broken Hill Prop, is into the ore body at
1400 ft., which is 400 ft. below the present deepest point
at which any quantity of ore is broken. Taking into
account no ore whatever below 1200 ft. —and not much
apparently at that point—the reserves were estimated in
May last at 2,955,000 tons ; but what can be added to
that nobody knows till some crosscuts are put through
the body at the deeper levels. Still, it isn’t so much a
question of quantity as it is of quality. The metal con-
tents of the newly-found stuff are good ; but it is mixed
with rhodonite, and that means that it is tough, expen-
sive both to mine and to mill, and then it won’t give a
good extraction. In fact, as far as it has been probed,
the 1400 ft. level of the B. 11. Prop, offers the same pro-
blem that the Junction North has been struggling with
for years, only the Junction North has been helped by
rather higher metal contents. Yet that co. has never, so
far, been helped to dividends—out of this class of ore, at
least.

For years the attitude of the Broken Hill Prop,
towards the Carmichael-Bradford desulphurising process
has been cold, and some hard things have been said-
Now, after these years, the B. 11. Prop, has secured certain
rights to use the process (it adopted the Huntingdon-
Heberlein system in preference originally); but what the
big co.’s idea is hasn’t transpired. Carmichael-Bradford
shares, anyhow, become marketable again.
There is talk that Wi-L, Baillieu means to go
hard for a seat on the Board of the Broken Hill Prop.

hustle in quarters that simply hate that vulgar sort of
thing—or pretend to.

J un 9tion North has been making a dash
pretty well by itself, and promises to keep up the pace,
unless it finds that it is smashing* too many Wilfley
tables and Gates’ crackers. Rhodonite in the ore is re-
u or lnos k the damage, though the racing of
the high-speed mill engine, when relieved of part of its
load, is enough to account for the breaking of the tables.
But even the Junction North eases off work at the
bottom level the 1134 ft. —till metals are higher or the
upper levels are nearly worked out.
* * * *
When the British B.H. starts stoping its new
body on the 800 ft. level—which by all appearances it will
be able to do from Thompson shaft—the mill will have
some splendid values to deal with. But the mill-man will
have a lot of trouble with fhodonite ; the new body seems
to be a slice of rich sulphides wedged between two thick
walls of rhodonite. The British is in hopes that the
800 ft. lode will extend right through to Thompson shaft.
Unfortunately ore bodies in the British have a knack of
not doing what is expected of them.

Kembla (N.S.W.) has been put out of its sus-
P e P,® e T the Electrolytic Refining Co. has started to
build its works there. The co., once moving, won’t lose
time. It consists not only of men with money, but of
men who don’t like to see money lying unproductive in
partly-finished works. The co. has already made a long
contract with Mt. Morgan—which, to a great extent, is
itself.

. Sydney Harbor Collieries, Ltd., had a meeting
in London last month, when it was announced that from
the end of January, when the machinery should be com-
plete, “ the output from the colliery will increase week
by week until the maximum output which the engine is
capable of winding is reached ” —and that is apparently
400 to 500 tons per eight hour shift. It was 14 years ago
on January 26 since the first co. was registered—l 4 years
of difficulty and struggle ; and the full fruits of it all
won’t be reaped until the shaft is equipped with a much
more powerful hauling plant. The co. has now a sft. 9in.
seam of first-rate coal available.

English-owned Cobar Gold Mines, which has
for over two years been considering in a leisurely way
what to do with its ore, has put the battery at work
again by way of getting some pulp ready for the oil pro-
cess. Since the failure at the Pinnacles, faith in the
Elmore system has cooled off several points ; yet there is
no question about the laboratory success of the principle.
The trouble at the Pinnacles probably was that the pulp
wasn’t suitable—the crushing machinery was a quaint
mixture, anyway.
* • * *
A fine collection of highly-colored adjectives
has been spent on the Grafton copper mine (N.S.W.),
and some people got tbe idea that another Morgan or
Lyellhad been found at Oangai. But it is generally like
that when the find is made in a district that isn’t used to
mining. As a matter of fact, the figures are small. In
spite of last year’s phenomenal prices, the profit only ran
to £14,252, of which £ll,OOO was distributed, or 13J per
cent, on capital (£80,000). Moreover, £12,463 of the
total production (£29,541) is represented by “stocks on
hand ”; and the management doesn’t mention at
what figure this ore, matte, etc., are valued.
The directors do, however, say that “ a recovery
(in the copper market) is evident, and we are
hopeful that before January is ended there Will be a firm
increase in price.” If they have worked out their esti-
mate in that spirit, there may be trouble ahead, and some
over-valuations may have to be provided for. The
manager estimates that of the ore reserves 17,713 tons are
of the 10 per cent, grade hitherto worked—that is, two
and a half years’ output at last year’s rate. Altogether,
including the low-grade (3£ per cent.) ore, 112,177 tons
are available, containing 5667 tons copper. Reckoning it
up on a Mt. Lyell basis, that is equal to three and a half
months’ consumption of ore and eight and a half months’
output of copper. So far, with all its disadvantages, it
has been a profitable mine ; only it isn’t yet in the big
class, and doesn’t promise to get there.

At the True Blue, Wyalong (N.S.W.), rich
mineral ore is coming up from a depth of 1360 ft., and a
record yield of gold is promised for this year. At the
Golden Fleece, the new winding plant, the largest on the
field, has commenced hauling. The Barrier is also com-
mencing the year under better conditions. Poppet-legs
and up-to-date machinery are being provided. After
nearly four months’ delay in dealing with the 29 applica-
tions for the old Operator lease, the Department has
ordered another inquiry, to ascertain the names of appli-
cants entitled to go to a ballot. Apparently Wade’s anti-
gambling law is to be hung up while the Mines Depart-
ment gets the applicants to shake for the prize.

Total Westralian output of gold since 1886 to
end of December is 19,761,053 fine oz., valued at
£77,375,707. Compared with the previous year’s figures
the drop in the value of the production for 1907 is a few
thousands short of half a million sterling. Dividends have
totalled £17,475,328, of which £1,738,163 was paid last
year. The chief contributors have been—Great Boulder,
£2,644,300 ; Horseshoe, £2,520,000; Oroya-Brown Hill,
£2,067,491 ; Ivanhoe, £1,868,750 ; Great Fingall,
£1,543,750; Lake View Consols, £1,396,250 ; Perseverance,
£1,321,250; Kalgurli, £585,000 ; Associated, £555,225 ;
Associated Northern, £525,000; and Sons of Gwalia,
£458,175. So far the January distribution reaches
£158,969.

The new regulations governing State batteries
in Westralia abolish the sliding scale of charges based on
ore values, and substitute a new scale based on the
quantity of ore sent for treatment. Under the new order
10s. per ton is charged on all lots up to 150 tons ; from
150 to 200 tons, 9s. 6d. per ton ; over 300 tons, 9s. per ton.
Provision is also made for treating ore on a time basis
15s. 6d. per hour for the use of a 10-head mill, and Bs. per
hour for the use of a five-head mill. All round the new
rates mean a substantial reduction.
* * • *
Last month the milling grade of Boulder Per-
severance ore dropped, as expected, to 6fdwt. Earlier ip
the year a frantic effort was made to boom the shares by
attractive outputs, frequent dividends, and “ boosting
developments ; but the public was not haying any, con-
sequently insiders were not able to unload to any great
extent. Mines on the. Perseverance line no more get
richer in depth than the world gets younger as it grows
older As a matter of fact, the mines in that locality go
poorer, and the public will suffer if it forgets that obvious
fact.
A few thousand tons of Golden Link ore are to
be put through the Lake View mill (W.A.). Latter co.
now holds a four-sevenths interest in the Link ; and, as
recent developments have exposed some good bodies of
ore, the crushing may decide the co. to exercise its option
over the balance of the shares.
*****
Remarked lately that the Great Ophir (W.A.)
dtdn’t inspire much confidence, and the result of the
long-delayed first crushing will not inspire any more.
Local papers that till recently boomed the show as “ one
of the best outside Kalgoorlie ” now blame the mill. The
latter is certainly a strange mixture, and it goes about its
business in a queer way, but in the end it will be found
that the mine is in more need of gold than the plant is of
efficiency.
* * * *
Golden Pole Co. (W.A.) has taken an option
over the Kohinoor South, at Stakewell, in the Murchison
district. Some time back Nat Harper, who has just resigned
his seat on the Pole, bought a controlling interest in this
property, and put it into a small co. The property is
said to have prospects, and may turn out all right; but
should the option be exercised the Pole shareholders had
better scan the price closely.
* * * *
. Black Horse and Egerton (Vic.) has ended up
ingloriously under the hammer. Vickery’s death took
away the co.’s stand-by, the bank wouldn’t take risks
over has-beens; so the two old mines have gone. As to
the plant, the best thing that could happen was its sale ;
as to the mines, they have for seven years been too dis-
appointing for words, and they deserved what mine-
examiner Weinberg said about them. There was talk
about 8., M. and Co. having a shot at the shows, because
native copper was present in the big dyke ; but the firm
wisely shied off. All that now remains is for the cyaniders
to tackle the tailings.
• * * *
Birthday Tunnel, boss cocky at Berringa (Vic.)
to-day, with a record of £12,500 called up, £169,061 of
gold won, and £52,000 dividends, does not look very com-
fortable. The reef at the bottom level south and north
hasn’t gone over 4dwt. That is under the paying mark,
as actual mining costs run off with 12s. 2d. per ton, and
there are no nice little pockets available to sweeten
things. Ore is being groped for from No. 7 level. What
strikes the eye about the mine is that the gold does not
extend so far from the breaks as in the upper levels.
Therefore, with its big lease, the game is to push
on work in the shallow ground at No. 2 shaft,
despite that results there have so far been decidedly
negative. The co. has a big claim; . and while
that does not always mean a big mine, still the Tunnel
management is good, there is no waste of cash, and as a
dwt. above present averages means divs., there is always
a chance for better times. And the directors dearly love
a div., for their fees don’t pay for drinks.
* * * *
Williams’ United, Bendigo, has a big lump of
quartz to work—the southern extension of the Catherine
Reef formation—but it is poor stuff. Now and then a
color of gold can be seen, but not enough to cause a
ripple on the share market. If the co. did hit gold there
would be as lively a flutter as there was when Catherine
Reef started to earn divs. At present all that can be said
is that the co. has a big lease, a big reef, and a big past.
Without gold, how much for the lot ?
• * * *
The Cassilis (Vic.) Board wanted £3500, and
had assets alleged to represent £43,000. The bank said
“Yes; but you give us a bill of sale over the lot.” So
shareholders are asked to put up the money instead.
They have agreed to a new issue of shares, part of which
has been under-written, but they say they must come, in
on underwriting terms. No one can object to this; but
the whole scheme of watering the register was poor busi-
ness. The mine has paid three times as much in divi-
dends as has been called up. Therefore, the calling-
power on the existing scrip should have been raised
another 10s., and calls made. The fact is the Board is
frightened at the carping of one or two shareholders.
Yet if these latter were crowded into a corner they would
be found quite harmless.
m * * *
Glenfine South (Vic.), which in its brief good
days paid £67,375 in dividends, and managed to get off a
new issue of 7500 pound shares at a premium of 305., is in
a very sick state now ; and the reports just issued don’t
speak above a whisper. The half-year’s outlay was
£4668, and only £1370 of it came from the mine ; the
balance was got either from the bank or from calls.
Fortunately, the shareholders are a good call-paying lot,
and the bank overdraft only got further behind to the
extent of a few pounds. Still, it amounts to £1693,
which means three months’ steady calling. However,
except for those who plunged, Glenfine South, even as it
stands, has done very well. Including the premium on
the new shares, the capital put up, calls and all, amounts
to £40,817 ; so shareholders have had about 335. 6d. back
for every 20s paid.
Lord Nelson’s half-year fell short of the ex-
pectations of the very sanguine crowd that has the old,
one-eyed warrior in hand. Profit and loss account shows
£3424 to the good on the six months’ work, and that has
brought the net overdraft down to £1642. The directors
still have their good opinion about the much-discussed
treatment-plant—" it has justified expectations in re-
ducing the cost of treatment.” But the market nowadays
looks on with a cold, fishy eye.
* * # *
Since Star of the East, Sebastopol Plateau
(Vic.), was recast, a good many financial holes have had
to be puttied up ; yet money still drains from share-
holders instead of flowing to them. A lot are dead-tired,
as shown by 15,000 out of 36,000 shares having gone back
to the co. As there is £422 of calls in arrear, it looks as
if a few are keeping the old show going as a forlorn hope.
The co. owes £9OOO on its old account, and is in credit
£3OO on »>•< new; but, as a set-off, has unpresented
cheques tot e amounting to £1076. Things could not be
much wor financially, and one does not clearly see
an improv .lent ahead. The Albion lode never has been
much of o producer, but it was a pity it could not have
been readied at 600 ft. instead of the co. pottering at
depth ; for recovery must come from the upper levels.
At least, no good ground has ever been broken below
1800 ft.
* * * ■»
Crown Lyell (Tas.) lives on hope, and on the
balance of the option money it got some time back.
During the half-year only 77ft. of development work was
done. Efflux of cash for the six months was £340, of
which £BO went to directors and manager. The two
Js.P., Lonergan and Madden, would have “blown” as
much in a month in the gaudy days of old ; but a very
cautious chairman, by the name of Giles, permits no ex-
travagances to-day. Work in the north-east ground has
proved nothing, so the wind is to be raised by a chase
after the North Lyell shoot at depth—it will have to be a
big depth. J. Bull is to be asked to put up the cash.
This in a co. of 250,000 £1 shares, with 3s. 9Jd. uncalled.
With Mt. Lyell turning upits noseat the lease, and directors
shirking the calling up of capital although the mine is
now dry, J. Bull will hesitate to pull the chestnuts out
for the Crown crowd.

Chief-engineer Pagan, with mud in his eyes and
flood-water running through his hair, is doing his best to
satisfy the departmental conscience that the train is
running to Cloncurry (Q.). But it’s a sort of shipwreck,
and Pagan has wired to Commissioner Thallon that
salvage operations will cost £4OO before he can get the
train into the terminus. Three weeks of dry weather and
an expenditure of £2OOO would enable him to make traffic
moderately sure. There have been over 100 washouts,
and several bridges which have been repaired once have been
again washed away. No doubt it has been a fast rail-laying
performance on the Cloncurry track ; yet the public has
been stuffed with a lot of newspaper nonsense concerning
the job generally. The scheme has been to lay rails on
the surface, make temporary deviations to effect creek
crossings at low levels, and do the bridge work in the
future. The alleged bridges that have been repaired and
washed away again are in most cases just “pig-sty”
erections, known well to mining men. Logs are laid (to
form a square) “ two on top of two,” and on these the
temporary rails are laid. Quite good enough for the time
being, and a grand idea for a non-tropical country.
Cloncurry, however, cannot regard"itself seriously as a
railway town until the end of this year. It may be later
before the permanent bridges are actually completed.
* * * *
It would take an earthquake to shake any in-
terest in Cloncurry into the share markets at present.
The news, wired from the North, that in the Great Aus-
tralia the Q. E. Co. had struck rich sulphides didn’t make
a ripple. Yet it means permanency for some Cloncurry
mines.

Dalziell’s tin (N.Q.) doesn’t look too promising
below the tunnel level. Management has done a lot of
sinking, crosscutting and driving without any promising
result. The make in the side of the open cut has possi-
bilities ; it goes from 3 to 4 per cent., but there is not
enough done on it yet for one to say whether it is just a
dab left from the old ore shoot or not.

PPERCY THE BIRD: “ Fer Gord’s sake, Archie, me
hoy, don’t never walk under a ladder. It’ll
crool yer luck.”
Lantana : Down towards Wollongonc,
on the N.S.W. South Coast, the drought is
so bad that the 20-acre lagoon on the Five
Islands Estate is now dry, for the first time
since the oldest inhabitant began to notice
things. A gun belonging to a settler, who
was drowned ‘‘fifty years ago,” was picked up
on the dry bed of the lagoon. And that is put
forward locally as proof that it is more than a
half-century since the lagoon last gave up its job.
Irtereseem to be several leaky places in the
alleged proof ; but moist South Coast

And Wade wants to put the Federal capital kt
Canberra, right m the midst of the parch
“Vedette”: Regarding the drying up of
“ Mother of Ducks ” Lake, near G-uyra (B. 9/l/’08).
Another instance of vanishment is Lake George,
near Gundaroo (N.S.W.), described in geographies
as the principal lake in the State. Ten years ago
this sheet of water was over 20 miles long and
something like 10 miles broad, and in some places
it attained a depth of five fathoms. Ducks and
wild fowl abounded, and it was a sportsman’s
paradise. When the Commonwealth was estab-
lished there was still sufficient water in the lake
to cause the residents of that part to dream of a
Federal city to be established on its banks.
Several dry seasons reduced the great inland sea
to the size of a pond. Now there isn’t even a
pond, nor is the water ever expected to return.
The bed has been subdivided and leased, and
where the wild fowl once soared sheep and cattle
graze. The waters did not subside through a hole
in the ground as was the case with the Guyra
Lake; they simply evaporated. Lake George
was not fed by any rivers or creeks of magnitude.
It relied on a good-sized catchment area, and, with
the absence of rain, the lake disappeared as a
natural outcome. Some of these times heavy
floods may fill the big saucer again, but in the
meantime the farmers and graziers thereabout are
making hay while the drought shines.
“Won Hi”: I am hurt at “Jimmie
Pannikin’s” suggestion (B. 19/12/’O7) that I
cast doubts on his Murray cod narrative. I
wouldn’t question that dear old yarn for worlds.
It is too venerable. Its age protects and sancti-
fies it. It was a favorite with Max Adeler, in the
early ’so’s of last century. Max used to consider
it his best yarn, and, I think, could tell it even
better than our own “Jimmie.” When Max
wrote his “Out of the Hurly-Burly,” he thought
the book incomplete until he introduced this story
of “Jimmie’s,” and, having sought the muse,
wove round the incident some beautiful verses,
which, if held out at arms’ length in a dark room,
might easily be taken for poetry. There are
differences, though slight, in the grand old story
as told by “J. Pannikin” and Max. For
instance, Max always maintained the scene was
in the States, whilst “Jim” gives the yarn a
local coloring. “Jim” swears his hero was a
Murray cod, Max always billed him as a pike.
Don’t remember a ’Erald man in the drama, but
if he was I reckon the said ’Erald man and my-
self will see “Jimmie” through this business,
even if we smell of gum leaves thereafter for a
vear.

“ Gip ” : Swallows, if they are luck-
bringers, as the Swedes and some others believe,
are cantankerous little beasts. Two entered this
bush abode not so long ago, and for days talked
volubly about what they were going to do. After
serious consideration of their surroundings, they
started to ring round with mud the lidless top of
a discarded teapot way up on a high shelf. But
worry roosted on the old man’s eyebrow, and his
heart was not in his job. His wife was a whale
for work, but half his time he sat gazing pensively
at a large and somewhat fearsomely colored photo-
graph of Edna May. At last he decided that he
would build on the top of that photo frame
or nowhere, and started a nest in opposition
to bis wife. After his first blob of
mud had been attached he worked like
10 demons, but his wife, now become
a common scold, continued building on
the teapot. Out of the corner of her
angry eye she saw that the picture-
frame nest was taking form. Its
growing solidity astonished her, and
one day she confessed herself beaten,
and humbly brought in a wisp of grass
and asked her lord to tuck it in. All
went merrily after that. The teapot
was forgotten, and during the fortnight
in which the parents hatched the small
speckled eggs, I was busy choosing
suitable names for the expected nippers,
and wondering if I could teach them
tricks. One morning there was a joyful
fluttering and twittering, and I knew
that a couple of proud parents talked
fondly to their ' offspring. The old
man kept darting in and out, but for an
hour or two his wife guarded the nest.
Then they flew out together, presum-
ably in search of food. Quick as light-
ning I jumped on a table, and putting
my fingers into the nest felt three
wobbly microbes. The table was re-
placed, and innocence was written all
over me when the old birds came in.
The mother cooed to the youngsters
and bent down as if to feed them, but
her head darted back and with a
puzzled and ruffled look she called
sharply to the old man. He came to
her side and rested on the nest. After
that they simply screamed at each
other, and without further considera-
tion murdered their babies with vicious
pecks, and dropped the three of them
in the garden. After the last had been
carried out, they returned, and one un-
natural wretch sat on the teapot and
the other on the nest; and with seeming
triumph tried to sing each other down. Was it
because I touched the nest ?

“ Polstan ” : “ Ed’s ” yarn that sheep im-
prove a forest (B. 16/l/’08) is all bunkum. As a
general rule, the Vic. foresters won’t allow sheep
anywhere near their old forests, because they
nibble the seedlings down like grass. You never
see young growths in a paddock reserved for
sheep. As for the splendid avenues of gum
trees in the Avoca district, which were obtained
by ploughing a couple of furrows for the seed to
lodge in,” I wonder if “ Ed ” would mind stating
exactly where they are. I’ve lived in the Avoca
district for years, but I’ve never had a chance to
take my enemy’s best girl down that alleged
avenue.

“ Ne’er-do-Weel ” : A notable mining liar
frequents the pie-shop where I have my modest
lunch. Sometimes he is immaculate in attire, and
has the best the establishment provides (nine
penn’orth). More frequently he is seedy, and his
linen dingy and frayed ; then he only has a cup of
tea and a scone (four penn’orth); but always he
commands the attention of everyone in the place.
Always also he has a friend with him, and the
friend usuaHy pays for both. To that friend he
holds forth in a voice which fills the room on the
marvellous mining coups he has pulled off. I have
jotted down the amounts he has made in the last
it 6 ?' ears ’ anc! I find the total reaches £1,750,350
His losses in the same period have totalled £1730’
and those lie incurred because he followed some-
one else’s judgment instead of his own. Last
week he made £37,000, but he looked even more
seedy than usual, and never rose even to the
dignity of a pie. He had the same old four
pennorth. I really do not think he can always
adhere strictly to the truth. Do you ?
HIS BRIGHT IDEA.
THE JOHNNIE : “ Dcah me! And is that awful heap carried up heah? It strikes me it would
be easier to dig another hole down there, don't you know, and bury it."
“Gip”: Am often amused,, and always
puzzled, at the effect the green grub—the sort
that devours your young peas—has on ants. For
ten minutes or so they will not tackle the verdant
crawler; but the temptation becomes too strong,
and one by one they go for him. Directly they
touch the grub, no matter where, the circus
begins. For the smallest part of a second they
wear a worried look. Then they behave as
if they’d struck oil (kerosene). Some dance on
their hind legs, waving the front ones wildly, and
biting the atmosphere savagely. Others stagger
away in a disgusting state of drunkenness, or
drop backwards and struggle weakly. It is not
an unusual sight to see a dozen or so disabled ants
kicking, biting, staggering, and rolling round one
affable green grub, which, with apparent cheer-
fulness, is inviting them warmly to come on.
Some recover in 15 minutes,-others not for half-
an-hour. Kill the g-rub, and instantly he is
dragged holewards by newcomers, to whom he
causes no ill effects whatever.
“Silas Snell”: During the Christmas
holidays I struck a good stout drinker, one of the
olden times. He carried a small swag, and came
out of the dust and heat of the wildneress into
the bar at Little Jim’s, at Mundic. His face was
burned the hue of new leather, and fearfully
seamed, and the wrinkles were full of dust. There
was a green flytrap dangling from his hat, and his
grey whiskers threw up a cloud of real estate
when he shook his head. . “’Ot!” he said. “It
is, mister,” replied Little Jim. “What’ll you
take?” “I’ll take a ring o’ beer!” replied the
Australian walking man. Little Jim looked
beaten. “A ring o’ beer?” he said. “T’ be
sure,” answered the swaggy, putting a half-
sovereign ®n the counter. “This is how: Pull
me eight or nine to begin with.” The landlord
pulled nine beers, and the swaggie placed them
in a circle on the counter, stood off, and gazed on
their frothing elegance in mute admiration for a
minute, and then gripped one. “Now, mate,”
he said, “you keep the circle. As fast as I drink
’em you fill ’em up agen, ’n’ whatever you do
don’t break the ring.”
“ Peter Pan ” : Casualness is not confined
to the Australian—his cat comes in for a share of
it as well. A tragic she-feline wandered into my
yard, a few days ago, with its tail hanging by a
small strand of skin. Said grimalkin gazed
pathetically at its yesterday afternoon for a few
seconds, and then deftly bit the trailing portion
off. The titbit was too good to waste, and
promptly went the way of the family mouse. The
morsel was appetising, and Mrs. Tom looked
around for more. She was astonished pretty con-
siderably, however, to find that that portion of
her department had already been retrenched.
“ Cict ” : As the nosebag is to the whaler
or the jaw pouch to the monkey, so is the frill to
the frilled lizard. The other day, being hungry for
knowledge, I took three score of large-winged
grasshoppers in charge, and opened an experi-
ment on the frilly one. The first thirty-seven of
them he enveloped with alacrity, etc., but the
odd twenty-three he seized slowly and deliberately,
and carefully deposited, each in its turn, among
the tucks and folds of his frill. After that the
reptile looked as doth a woman with extra
crinolines aboard ; and yet there are those who
say he conveys this frill around with no greater
ambition than to flash it flauntingly whenever he
wanders against some youthful and comely
lizardess. Moreover, others protest that, instead
of bounding on his hat as any sane person would
when annoyed, the lizard merely distends and
flaps his frill at the enemy. But I assert that he
employs the shelves and recesses of his frill as a
handy storehouse against a rainy day, and my
statements have always stood inspection up to
now.
“ Peka ” : A correspondent inquires (B.
9/l/’08) the meaning of “Malua.” Britishers in
Fiji use the word in precisely the same sense as
we do the Maori “Taihoa,” which means “ Hold
on!” “Wait-a-bit!” “ Don’t hurry !” or “Don’t
do anything this year that you can put off till
next.” “ Malua ” and “ Taihoa ” are at once the
curse and the happiness of brown brother every-
where—unless you go to Spanish America and
strike “Manana,” which is “pretty soon,” and
amounts to the same thing, after all.
* * * *
“ Koolka ” : Curious how soon the Aus-
tralian aboriginal loses his bush lore. On the
west coast of South Australia there are still
quite a number of degenerate blacks who subsist
by hunting the rabbit and somewhat more in-
frequent ’possum. The method is simple.
Dogs smell bunny out, and the “ line of strike ”
is discovered by poking the burrow with
a piece of stick. Then, with a miniature
crowbar and much hand-scratching, a shaft
is sunk, and the process is repeated till bunny
is brought up to a dead end. Inland from
the coast lies a lot of virgin whipstick scrub,
and some surveyors told the niggers there was
a fortune in ’possums “out back.” Next day
the great trek started, but less than a week saw
them back again on the coast hanging round the
town. “Plenty ’possum, but too much plurry
scrub ! ” they explained, and went on to tell how
they used to get bushed and lose one another.
Now, was it loss of bushcraft, or the “call of the
city ” ?
* * * *
“Gip” : Yesterday I saw a boy in knickers
driving back to pasture his flock of sixty or seventy
newly-shorn “poddies,” and it reminded me that
the ewe is about the most indifferent mother in
the bush. Youngsters located near a big station
can quite easily lay the foundation of a future
fortune, provided they have at their command
certain necessaries—milk and grass. The ewe will
desert her offspring on the slightest provocation.
If the lamb is weak and disinclined to follow, the
mother joins the departing mob, regardless of its
cries. The squatter knows that a deserted lamb
will die, also he has no time to “poddy” it.
This is where the enterprising youngster scores,
and the squatter will very often buy back, at
market price, his own half-grown lambs. I still
have unhappy recollections of a day in early spring
when I spent hours trying to make a ewe mother
her newly-born lamb. The little chap was
crying lustily some distance from the recumbent
ewe. I thought her weak, and lifted her, after
which she promptly bolted, bawling, for the mob.
I picked up the lamb and pursued her, but she
simply lost me. The cries of the hungry lamb
would have melted a heart of stone, and, thinking
the mother might return to it, I laid it down and
hid myself behind some briars. For an hour or
so I froze there while dusk descended; but the ewe
never came back, and I, feeling a murderess, left
the lamb crying in the wilderness. Lambs are
very easy to rear, and will accept any old thing as
a mother. One I picked up not long ago drank
three saucers of milk greedily an hour or two after
its birth.
BEAR-HUNTIN’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The opossum—like the kangaroo, wallaby and native
bear (a kind of sloth) —is prized for its furry coat. Of
late years the demand for furred skins has increased
enormously, and ’possum snaring has in consequence
become an industry.— From “ Snaring the. Opossum,” in
a Fitchett publication.
The bear, high in his eucalypt, makes war on honey-
bees !
Come, then—let us, the useful men, rank with his
enemies, •
And reach our idle pea-guns down. Let’s have steel gins
prepared,
While Brother Fitchett tells us how the slothful bear is
snared !
What though, for skinning others’ sheep, the skinner’s
sent to prison,
Some loafer wants a cheap fur wrap? Our bear must
part with his’n
The gentlemanly, poor, old childish bear,
With peaceful gum-leaves twined among his hair—
He claws and sobs, with twisted back,
Across the grim fur-stealer’s track !
Ah, what dread Private Enterprise is there?
Bird of the air, and ranging beast—all things that fly and
pad ;
The gaudy tuft, the breast of down, the good brown fur
do glad
The chilly heart of him who makes soft life his shrieking
prey—
Who founds his ghastly fortunes in the cool Fitchettian
way.
The feather-cursed, the finely-fleeced, clean fur from nose
to rump,
They scent!—and leave their play' to seek new play-
grounds, on the jump.
Tattered fur and feathers on the ground—
Screams, and crimson life-blood all around !
Out where the kindly sunshine lies
On drabbled skins and staring eyes
What lovely Christian energy is found !
Young Mick, from school, plugs Little Bear, and slugs
him where he’s soft.
He brings him, clawing earthward, from his leafy perch
aloft ;
And this is thoughtless sin—Mick wants his tender regions
smacked
For foolish ways ; but here is Man, with city science
backed !
The slaughter-boss, full-grown—this grim furmonger goes
about
To chevy little gummy bears and rip their vitals out !
Red blood, and fur bedrabbled —sudden death,
Slow death, red death —all kinds he suffereth
Who dies, with 'possum, and with bird
Of splendid plumes. Ana have you heard
Him, sob for mercy with his dying breath 1

Dear B.—“ Pastora ” (4/l/’08) is wrong in
ascribing to the rabbit invasion the increase
everywhere of native and tiger cats. I have been
or 30 years a resident of Western Riverina.
Quarter of a century ago, native and tiger cats
ounshed ; since the arrival of bunny, they have
■ eachly decreased — whether from inability to
igest rabbit fur or from over-eating, I know not.
f ai B - rate - if “ Pastora ” can dig up either kind
’ P“ ss between Deniliquin and Wentworth, he
an have a new panama hat from yours truly, M.
Macaulay, Moulamein.

MARY: Well, he was on y say in’ the other day, that limes were so bad that he'd have to get

“ Strawhalian ” : Have waited in vain for
some forceful stylist to uprise and rend “ Corn-
stalk ” for his lie (B. 19/12/’O7) re removing extra
teeth from 4-tooth ewe, and winning a prize with
the remaining portion of that jutnbuck in the
2-tooth section. “Cornstalk’s” scheme would
require the removal of two pairs of incisors, leav-
ing the centre pair stranded in a barren wilderness
of gum. Now, the second pair of incisors are
always showing before the first are full up. Does
“ Cornstalk” mean to suggest there is any sheep
judge in the Commonwealth who doesn’t know
that fact, and, knowing it, would be taken in by
the flagrant fake he tells of? Yab !

“ Werrimee ” : “Talkin’ about ridin’
bullocks,” said the teamster, “I stuck a saddle
on Brindle up at the scrub one day when I was
pushed for a horse, an’ he didn’t shape too bad.
Bit rough an’ stiff-necked when yer wanted to
haul him round anyways sharp ; but he’d gee off’
an’ ‘comehither’ good enough where he’d plenty o’
ground. An’ quiet’s a lamb. Was cornin’ clitter
clatter down th’ road to see McGurren about some
logs I wanted to sell in a hurry. I was cedar-
gettin’ then. Just near Pintpot sliprails a bald
head shot up from behind a log, an’ th’ next thing
I knows I’m rollin’ under a cockspur bush, an’
Brindle’s peltin’ back to th’ mountains, with the
flaps o’ the saddle floggin’ him like two big wings ;
an’ ’there’s Alex. McGurren divin’ under th’
fence’s if he was after something an’ ’adn’t much
time to ketch it in. The old scamp ’ad been on
his hands an’ knees squintin’ up a holler log,
lookin’for native cats. ‘Losh!’ he ses, leanin’
across th’ fence. ‘ ’Tis yesel, Bill Sooley ’ ! ‘ Some
of it is,’l ses, unwindin’ a yard o’ yaller spider
web from me neck, an’ subtractin’ some super-
fluous prickles. ‘Ye’re a lucky mon, Soolev,’
he ses. ‘ Where’s th’ dash luck come in?’ I ses,
wipin’ the blood off me nose, an’ repairin’ me
ear. ‘Yedidna break ye’neck,’ ses McGurren.
‘ If ye ken when ye’re wul off, mon, ye’ll step it
hame.’ Seein’ as Brindle was only a speck on tli’
horizon, an’ still makin’ tracks, there wasn’t much
choice about it. I stepped it home, after sellin’
tli’ logs; an’ that old dog ’ad forty ’orses in th’
paddock at th’ time, all hog fat for want o’
ridin’ ” 1
“ Benbee ” : “ The Prooshan ” (B.
19/12’/07) tells of an ingenious fossicker
who put down a shaft 40ft. all on his lone-
some. This is, I believe, no uncommon feat—-
amongst Chinamen—but white men do not seem
to go in for it much, probably because they have
better sense. The Chow that I saw at it was one
of a crowd on the old alluvial fields about Clermont
(Queensland). Wun Lung began with a circular
hole for a shaft. Up the sides of this circular
hole he had foot-holds and hand-grips cut out at
regular intervals, and up and down by these foot-
holds and hand-grips he travelled many times a
day. The first trip was, of course, down to work.
I hen, when he had sufficient mullock ready, he
came to the surface and passed down three or four
small buckets, or tins, or oil drums. Then he
went down and filled his ironmongery, and as
each one vvas filled he hooked it on to a peg that
he had driven into the side of the shaft. When
all the tins were full, he came to the surface and
left them on their respective pegs. The next act
was to pass his rope down and hook them up, one
by one, until he had them all emptied on the
mullock heap. After that, operations began
afresh.

“ Lone ” : In parts of W.A. the divining
rod is used with considerable success. When out
back, with a survey party some month ago, I
saw the process for the first time. He was a fine
specimen of an aborigine, and he came
into camp with a number of others, all
wearing the geological formations of
many years, and testifying, in more
senses than one, that there was no water
in the vicinity. Lavish promises of re-
ward only met with the assurance that
all the fluid had disappeared. The sur-
veyor discreetly believed the story. He
chummed up with the most loamy speci-
men, invited him to his tent, and gave
him whisky and corned beef—food, in a
nigger’s estimation, for the gods. In a
very short time that aborigine was in-
capable. He woke with a sore head, a
parched throat, and the firm belief
that-he had a cat with kittens in his
mouth. As soon as he had collected
sufficient of his senses, he made tracks
for the well which we were sure was
in the locality, but which we had been unable
to locate. I believe this is the only practical use
to which a Wayback blackfellow can be put.
“ Polstan ”: Be billy-boiling. Old “Ku-
Klux” comes out of his tomb of a hundred years to
shovel a bit of wisdom into Thk Bulletin anent
the fact that to prevent the water smoking it is
neeessarv to place round sticks on top of the
billy. He quite overlooks the fact that square
sticks don’t litter up the bush. But he has missed
the point even now. The sticks can be round,
flat, or elliptical, but they must have bark on
them. It’s only a hatter’s habit, anyway.
THE FATAL BEAUTY DOCTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Twas up at Briagingolong, where dust and heat and flies
With rabbits and with drought divide the land,
There came a man of mystery to fairly paralyse
The countryside the day it saw his brand.
pa nted shed with curtains draped did he pro-
That forms and features he’d regenerate ;
He stated “ Dr. Boshter, of Chicago,” was his name,
And he d turn you into beauties while you wait.
Maria .Tones kept company for seven weary years
With Biggs, the rouseabout at Curly Creek ;
Maria had a nose askew and Number 20 ears
She’d freckles big as shillings on her cheek.
She was nothing much to look at, but on usefulness was
Strong-
Each district milking record she possessed *
She could take a turn at ploughing, break a colt, or crack
a thong,
And she’d kill and brand and flay ’em with the best.
One day Maria made a trip to Briagingolong,
And stood entranced before the doctor’s door ;
She closed her little bank account, and gailv brought
along
The savings of a lifetime, to implore
That clever I)r. Boshter would his best endeavors use
To make her something joyous to hehold ;
And the kindly doctor promised, in a dozen interviews,
She'd be endowed with beauties manifold.
So, when Maria d finished milking twenty-seven cows,
And helped the other hands to fell a tree,
She’d hurry to the township, fast as modesty allows,
To have her face massaged by Dr. B.
Each night she d get her dumb-bells and her exercises do,
And rub herself with “Boshter’s Beauty Cream,”
Until, at last, to her delight, she g'radually grew
As lovely as a poet's summer dream.
In Briagingolong, where sweet romance is rather rare,
You’d nothing hear but fair Maria’s name ;
For the rainfall was forgotten, as her praises filled the air,.
And to far and dusty Speewaa spread her fame ;
While a lovesick writer in The Star of Briagingolong,
Whose head was in a wild erotic whirl,
Called her fairer than a damsel in an illustrated song
And the equal of the finest post-card girl.
When Biggs, who filled the post of rouseabout at Curly
Creek;-
Heard what a transformation there had been,
He reckoned it was up to him to make a move and
speak—
But dumb he stood before this peerless queen.
“ 1 think,” she said, in accents that the nicest cultivate,
As she shook her dainty chiffon skirts with pride,
“ You ought to know the doctor —as j’ou seemed a trifle
late—
Has asked me and I’m going to be his bride.”
Bill Biggs, he did a tumble like a colt that’s caught the
brand ;
Red blood he saw until the day grew dim ;
The woeful willy-willy, as it devastates the land,
Was not a single circumstance to him.
Then they calmed him down a little, and some counsel
wise he heard—
With good advice and whisky was he fed—
Then gave his name as Thomas Smith, and never said a
word,.
But enrolled himself at Dr. Boshter’s shed.
The Doctor labored hard at Biggs’s iron face betimes,
And less each day if grew a gruesome sight;
Until, a fortnight later, he was fully twenty times
As beautiful as Mr. Julius Knight.
No more his hands were hairy, and no more his nose was
red,
No more his sandy whiskers could you scan ;
The William Biggs of old was gone, and there arose in-
stead
A sort of superfatted Gibson man.
Then, one day, Sergeant Minahan received a warrant
blue,
And they saw him take the doctor, wan and pale ;
His case was heard at Tilpa, re a bogus cheque or two,
And they gave him seven years in Goulburn Gaol.
While faithless fair Maria sought her room and sadly
wept
Throughout the day in anguish and in pain,
Until she made her mind up, and to Biggs’ side she crept
To ask him if he’d take her back again.
“One moment,” said a woman’s voice, “just wait till I
have done ; ,
Such action, madame, modesty exceeds.”
Twas the daughter of a squatter with a million-acre run
And a hundred thousand head of British breeds.
She said, “ Young woman, Mr. Biggs is going to share my
joys ;
Please realise henceforth he’s mine alone ;
He s a daisy and a dandy and the Anal word in boys,
And just the thing for Ermyntrude Malone.”
So Maria s back at milking, and her beauty’s gone again,
For the doctor left no recipes behind ;
And her Savings Bank account is now a thing that’s void
and vain,
And anotherriover she can never find.
While the Biggses lead society around the countryside,
And further William every day succeeds
As the owner of a station that’s a million acres wide,
With a hundred thousand head of British breeds.

less Clay : Very good of you to send yarn, but it
appeared in Tub Bulletin with an illustration by Norman
Lindsay some months ago ... Clem Riley : Yarn re Brown,
his wife and the half-bred Jap unprintable and otherwise
awful. .. W. J. Sharpies : You ask The Bulletin to print
Resolutions for Conference. But look at No. 12 :
t hat this meeting wishes to express its contempt for
the Czar of Russia, as it is said that whenever The
Worker s name is mentioned in his august presence he
quickly retires to the darkest recesses of the Winter
1 alace, crawls under the bed, and shivers and quivers like
a shaken blanc-mange.” Picture the Czar’s feelings when
he read that. You are heartless Smooth-Bore : Your
camp-cook tragedy too rough. But it had points of
humor, and was basketed with regret L.A.R.: This is
how-you begin your horse-yarn :“ It was at an out-back,
next-door-to-Gehenna township, of which the local scien-
tists aver that it lies on the extreme edge of this oblate
spheroid in a position, nearest at all times, to that hoary

lines with a different bait, and next morning hauled three

a splurge.... Brad : Your rustic who attained middle age
without tasting mustard, and who, on sampling it for the
first time in a city hash-house, uprose violently and
dashed for God s fresh air, how-ling “ Slash all round yer
Johnny, they’ve poisoned yer ole dad,” strikes us as a fig-
ment of the imagination, or baseless fabric of a dream. In
fact, this office unites in diagnosing the yarn as a lie.
E.D.J.: The Boers came down to meet them. But that
won’t settle the argument J.W.R. (Q.) : Make a break
for originality, and send a joke about an Irishman who
was more or less sane. ..Boron ia: “The Jap” isn’t a
short story ; it’s a mere incident, and a slight one at that.
Bega : A horse-breeder told Willis not to put a finger
on his land ; an aboriginal, named Jimmy, said an Irish-
man—locally called “the Cardinal”—was a Fenian ; the
owner of a colt (own brother to a mare that ran second in
the Bega Cup) w-as told by Willis to call the said colt
“The Parson,” because the parson was seen driving

A MELBOURNE NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The squish of hoses ceaseth, and peace reigns o’er the
land,
And see, in faultless cotton garb, by heat from rooftree
banned,
Lo, Mr. Subbubs takes his snooze, a pot-plant in his hand.
Beside the path a dasnsel white lies wrapped in tossing
rest,
To wake, and get a higher C a-tremble off her chest—
As o’er her shape the midnight oat pursues his feline
quest.
Our Uncle John, the softgoods clerk, unto the grass-plot
speeds,
To dream of mowing lawns of sleep, and pulling forth the
weeds;
While ma is snoring fitfully amid the larkspur seeds.
We seem to hear another note across the solemn hush ;
What means that steady distant hum, that sound’s per-
sistent gush ?
’Tis Aunt, who chose the backyard plot and so avoids the
crush.
The hot night greets the dawning with a heavy, hollow
thud,
As Egbert, of the Austral Bank, who’s hosed the place
aflood,
Slides off the steep verandah edge and wallows in the
mud.
The milkman wan and wear3 T , rushing o’er the morning
land,
Sees the last remaining straggler of the pale suburban
band
Paddle housewards in his slippers with a pillow in his
hand.

WILL THE BEARS DO IT?
An interesting experiment is to be made in the Arctic regions by Captain
Ronald Amundsen, who proposes to lead an expedition towards the North Pole.
He will use bears to draw his sledges.
Captain Amundsen states that a bear Is ten times as
strong as a horse* and can haul as
much as 100 dogs.
A 100 dog-power bear (If properly
trained) ought in the near future to
become a powerful rival to the motor-
car in keeping down the population.
Captain Amundsen proposes to use bears that
he has captured as cubs, and trained, so that by
the time they grow up they are reasonably docile.
“ Hop ” hasn’t had much experience In cap-
turing Polar bears, but he should say that would
be an added danger to Arctic exploration.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
The Bent Three : Davies, Boyd, and
Weedon.
N.S.W. Premier Wade doesn’t seem to be
able to meet a visiting celebrity without letting it
be known that he is “an Oxford man.” He
started his education at All Saints College,
Bathurst (N.S.W.), and ended it at the Inner
Temple, London.
Hermit Geltmacher, oldest inhabitant of
Nimitybelle (Monaro), who died recently, was a
well-to-do man and a kindly qne to boot. He
devised the whole of his property to trustees for
the erection and maintenance of a people’s
hospital, to which residents within a ten miles’
radius are to have free admission.
England’s prize insolvent this week is one
James Herbert Farmer, who filed his schedule
when the Druce case closed with a bang. He
had invested £lOO,OOO in the bonds of the co.
which was formed to prove—for a handsome
profit, if successful—that Druce of the Baker-
street Bazaar (London) was really the Duke of
Portland, and the pile of paper realised £ll.
Therefore James Herbert Farmer was out
£99,989.
A somewhat remarkable identity, Miss
Elizabeth Wright, died recently at Goulburn
(N.S.W.) aged 75 years. She carried on the
bus ness of a hawker, drove her own horse, and
usually slept under her tilted cart. In the bush-
ranging ’sixties she was stuck up and robbed by
Ben Hall and his gang, yet it was a common
legend that Hall never interfered with women,
it being an interference, by a mighty police
official, with Hall’s own wife that caused a hitherto
respectable small squatter to take to the bush,
and run wild with a gun in his hand.
FORCE OF HABIT.
Ex-Governor Brassey has been raised to the position
of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. — News Item.
The next news will be that he has tumbled off.
John Plumper Hoolan, one of the relics of
the days when the Queensland Labor party was
made of wire and whipcord, and breathed
out sulphur fumes, is battling again up North.
Like a lot of those early irreconcilables John
Plumper Hoolan isn’t able to even submit
to Labor party discipline; but in some
respects, anyhow, he seems the same old
John Plumper—“no shilly-shally, wishy-washy,
willy-wagtail politician,” he says, “but an old
brumby who has never been yarded ”; also he is
“an old warrigal ” and a “ loony serub-piker with
long horns and shaggy hide.” Then he drops
right down and says in his manifesto that he
wants the Georgetown railway built, and that
that’s his main plank. It is probably the first
time on record that a “loony scrub-piker with
long horns and shaggy hide ” offered to lay down
its life to get a railway ; but when the scrub-piker
is branded “ Hoolan ” it is liable to break out in
strange places. The hairy one retired from the
Assembly in 1894, and a North Queensland jour-
nalist started his leading article : “ Hoolan and
Gladstone have resigned.”
Francis Sheriff Isaacs, who is making
a pleasant retirement from N.S.W. Stipendiary
Bench, had visions of a Supreme Court Justiceship
in the far back. He was running for wig and
gown under the auspices of his dad, who was
Martin’s Solicitor-General, when his health gave
way. The name of the said father, by the way,
was Robert Macintosh Isaacs —a combination
which deserves to be borne in mind. Bob Isaacs
—Bobby Isaacs' —Rob Isaacs—Robbie Macintosh
Isaacs ! Even the legendary Donald Moses wasn’t
more remarkable!
Australia begins to overdo the claimant
business. It has now produced either the third
or fourth alleged heir to the enormous shadowy
Page Millions (£150,000,000 or so), which have
been hanging round London like a thunder-cloud
for the best part of a century. The new man is
one Mullens, a Sydney Anglican cleric, who has
left for England to collect the money. Mullens
claims to be old Page’s grandson, but if he is that
now he has always been that, and people wonder
why, with such golden prospects ahead, he should
have been a humble slogger in the vineyard for so
long. It is a hot, dry, ill-paid job, this slogging
in the canefield of the Lord.
Almost the oldest Australian native, Flor-
ance Gardiner, succumbed to the heat in Mel-
bourne last week, aged 92—though it does seem a
bit like hanging the dog with the bad name to
blame the heat when somebody dies aged 92.
Born at Port Jackson settlement, just three
weeks aft,er the Battsle of Waterloo, Gardiner
lived a placid sort of existence till ’52, when he
went over to Melbourne in the’brig Almeda, and
camped between the city and where St. Kilda
would have been if it had been born earlier. He
was a first trustee of St. Kilda cemetery, and
preached considerably in the local Methodist
cluirelies, but otherwise he was an inoffensive old
gentleman, who did nothing of any note, and did
it very well.
S. Australia lost a remarkable old battler
lately—Captain Berry, who made a queer mixture
of seafaring and missionarying. He was full of
pluck ; among other things he brought out from
Glasgow, under steam, a fiat-bottomed vessel for
the River Murray trade. It drew only 6ft. of
water, and tossed around for four months ; but he
got it into the river all right. This was 40 years
ago. After that he took to missionarying—not in
the lazy South Seas, though, but in Adelaide
slums; and Adelaide is, for its size, about the
slummiest city in Australia. He preached a bit,
but not fhuch ; he battled harder to get the slum-
homes made more comfortable, and trampled on a
good many patent-leather covered toes in the
process.
The business of Cohen and Co., of New-
castle —the people who were lately burned out—
was founded in the ’thirties by P. J. Cohen, at
Maitland. There is a legend that the Cohens,
wanting to be near deep water, wished to build
extensive stores at Morpeth, but were unable to
do so, as E. C. Close, ex-military man, of Illalung,
Maitland, who held the land, refused to part with
a foot. The firm then built in High-street, West
Maitland, at that time little better than a
bullock-track. The founder of the business was
grandfather of some of the present proprietors.
At Maitland, the Cohens had the only synagogue
in N.S.W. outside Sydney, and maintained it
entirely at their own expense.
H. C. L. Anderson has taken the place of
T. A. Coghlan as the generally handy man of
N.S.W. Public Service. He used to be Examiner
in the Education Department; then he became
Director of Agriculture ; then he was made Public
LilHarian. A new department—that of Intelli-
gence—being created, he took charge of that; also
incidentally of the Bureau of Statistics. Now
another new department, Agriculture, falls to him.
Anderson is Australian-educated, of Celtic ex-
traction, and has made scientific agriculture and
Shakspearian research his two hobbi'es.
Yeteran W. G. Spence is president of the
A.W.U. again. No other man has such a hold on
union bushmen’s affections. Arthur Rae, who
will make any sacrifice for principle, thought
there ought to be an electiorrfor this as for the other
offices, so he nominated ; yet even he polled in
the two branches only 19§9 votes, as against the
G.O.M.’s 12,318. But when it wasn’t a question
of choosing between him and the G.0.M., the
Central branch showed what it thought of Arthur
Rae by making him its delegate to the P.L.L.
conference, giving him nearly twice as many votes
as the next man.
“ Sr.” tells a tale :
The course of true love is a troubled one. Fleming, of
Melbourne’s Yarra Bank, finds it so. For two years an
old lady, in a black satin dress, has eventuated at his
Sunday meetings. She takes up her position dhjectly in
front of the rostrum, and persistently interrupts the
harangues. Fleming publicly explains : “ This old soul
in the black satin dress wants me to marry her.
(Applause.) For two solid years she has pestered and
implored me to lead her to the altar. And because I
won’t marry her, she comes down here and tries to upset
my meetings. I wouldn’t marry you even if you were
covered with diamonds—so, there ! ” (Tumultuous cheer-
ing.) Then the old lady says wildly that she wouldn’t
marry Fleming on any account, and Fleming says the
feeling is mutual, and the crowd cheers some more, and
Fleming tries to resume his discourse, and the old lady
resumes her interruptions. It seems to be a deadlock.
A man whom The Bulletin never sus-
pected of taking an interest in church matters,
sends this: —
Archbishop Lowther Clarke, who refuses to reinstate
Victorian parson Nash, is not such a strong man as he
would like to be thought ; although throughout this
Church sensation he has acted with a dignified reserve,
which contrasted favorably with the emotionalism im-
ported into the business by Nash's Low Church pals.
Clarke is a person with a bull-neck, a superior British
manner, and a pig-headed disposition ; and the Low
Church party (led by Canon Safflier, an aggressive sky
pilot with a bald head), strikingly instanced the utter
tactlessness of parsons by trying to bully such an in-
dividual. Nash was the shining light of the Victorian
Low Church party, and his pals now threaten that if he
is not reinstated they will refuse to enter their pulpits.
A strike of parsons would be a novelty, but I fear it
would be upset the very first week by non-union
labor. Now that Clarke is off to England, the
Low Church party is directing most of its venom
against Archdeacon Bindley, who administers the
diocese in the boss prelate’s absenpe. Hindley is the
real power behind the throne ip the Vic. Anglican Church.
Clarke is ostensibly, the'head of the church, but his right
hand is Hindley—suave, diplomatic, and tactful, and one
of the few brainy parsons in Australia. It is his un-
enviable task to act as buffer between a clergy split into
two furiously opposed sections and an overbearing Arch-
bishop suffering from enlargement of what he balances
his hat on. Even his enemies admit that Hindley has
filled a difficult position well, but he is unpopular with a
large section of the clergy, probably because he is cursed
with a sense of humor. No really successful parson has
a sense of humor.
A MERCANTILE TRANSACTION.
CADDY : “ Very sorry, Miss, but I can't caddy fer you to-day.”
CHAMPION LADY GOLFER: “But how is that, Robert?”
C ADDY: “ Well, yer see, Miss, I sold yer to Ginyer Brown for a tanner."
Died recently, at Goyder’s Lagoon (S. A.),
an aboriginal woman named Andumaronkamina.
Her daughter was Duckokinawonarra, who was
the mother of Kooruntha, who took unto himself
a gin, and begat Dunapernunkkurda, the mother
of Ada, the half-caste child. The death was a
great relief to little Ada, who was generally sent
to call the whole family to dinner ; the dropping
of even one of such a terrible list of names will be
considerable saving on the jaw. Any patriotic
suburbanite, who desires something extra Aus-
tralian to distinguish his red-roofed dog-box from
the other red-roofed dog-boxes in the neighbor-
hood, should find a use for this scrap of family
history.
Judge G. C. Heydon, of N.S.W., whose
ill-health aggravates the weaknesses of the Arbi-
tration Act, and whose ill-health the Arbitration
Act seems to aggravate, arrived on the District
Court Bench under a novel condition. The
Gevernmerit of the day fixed up a special agree-
ment with him to the effect that if he retired
through illness within the first twelve months of his
service, he would receive no pension. Heydon
was a bank manager when he decided to chase
briefs. When a Legislative Councillor, he
fathered a proposal to make admissions to the
Bar, or the position of Gentleman One, dependent
wholly on examinations in law. He argued that
it is quite possible to construe the Dog Act
without being able to translate Horace, or solve a
quadratic equation, or pass an examination in the
insanity of Caligula.
George Allen Mansfield, a' Sydney archi-
tect, recently deceased, was son of Rev. Ralph
Mansfield, who filled many positions in his time.
He came out in 1820 as a Methodist Minister, and
preached and prayed for a while. He was editor
of the Sydney Gazette for a time, and wrote
leaders for the S. M. Herald and other papers.
Also he was the promoter of the Australian Gas
Light Company, and was its secretary till within
a year of his death. In the early ’thirties he
varied the monotony of life by setting up as a
bookseller, stationer, and printer in Bitt-street,
Sydney. The deceased G. A. Mansfield was 74
years of age at his death. He was named after
George Allen, the first admitted solicitor in Aus-
tralia, and married a daughter of that gentleman.
In his early days in Sydney George Allen occu-
pied the large stone house on the corner of
Princess and Essex streets, where his son, subse-
quently George Wigram Allen, Speaker of the
Assembly, was born. George H. Reid and his
father also lived there at one time.
An old Melbourne identity went over last
week at Booabula Station, near Deniliquin
(N.S.W.) —J. H. Blackwood, aged 79 years. In
1852 he and Captain James McMeckan founded
the shipping firm of McMeckan, Blackwood &
Co. Twenty-five years ago he purchased the
station property where he died. His partner,
Captain McMeckan, had an active life before
settling in Melbourne. In 1829 he entered as an
apprentice on the ship Waterloo, and sailed with
a cargo of lags for Botany Bay. Then the vessel
was chartered to convey convicts from Sydney to
Morel on Bay, where Captain Logan was in com-
mand, A third charter, with convicts from
Kingstown, Ireland, was McMeckan’s next visit to
Sydney. He then decided to retire from the lag-
carrying industry. His first visit to Port Phillip
was in 1836 in the Eudora from Hobart Town.
Williamstown had no houses then, and but one
tent. After visiting most of the Australian sea-
ports, the captain settled down in Melbourne in
’52, he being then 37 years of age, and Mr.
Blackwood, his partner, about 23. And so the
big shipping firm started.
Charles Atkins, of the Federal Chamber of
Manufactures, did some good work last year in
publishing a booklet of statistics entitled “Aus-
tralia Reflected,” 35.000 copies whereof were dis-
tributed in contradiction of the Stinking Fish
stories which had called the booklet into being.
A sum total of £OO was subscribed towards the
publication of “Australia Reflected.” Twelve
thousand copies were issued in this country, and
23,000 went to Great Britain to be scattered by the
mayors of rural districts among profoundly un-
informed agriculturists on market days. In due
course the energetic Atkins forwarded a balance-
sheet to the private subscribers, together with a
refund of 4s. lOd. in the guinea. The actual cost
of printing and issuing those 35,000 copies had
been considerably less than £6O.
Another globe-walking crank passed
through Melbourne during the hot spell. He
was adorned in boots, loose pants and jacket, and
slouch hat—nothing more except a mop of flowing
hair. Stockings and underclothing he regards as
superfluous. He was fairly sane in the matter of
clothing, though his hair was against him. Georg
Drutschel, as he is named, says he has lost all his
relatives by consumption and was himself within
cooee of the cemetery in ’9l, when he decided to
spend 23 hours out of each 24 in the open air.
Ilis idea at present is to circle the earth, convert-
ing all and sundry, but especially farmers, to his
views, and then to write the inevitable book on
his travels. It seems a waste of time to put the
“ open air ” view of life before Australian farmers;
still, there’s no harm in trying.
The Mrs. Percival Johnston, who appealed
to the English High Court the other day on a
Probate matter and got a decision that she need
not pay a certain K.C. his 100-guinea fee, belongs
to the family of the old Annandale (N.S.W.)
Johnstons. The first of these Australian John-
stons declined point blank to submit to N.S.W.
law, insisting that any charge against him should
be tried in London. He was a colonel of sorts,
and he gave a sergeant part of his pay in watered
rum, and stuck to the cash. He was cited to
appear at court-martial for retaining the money
and for swindling the sergeant over the rum, and
that old Johnston had the front to demand that
he should be tried, if at all, in England. Accord-
ingly he was sent to London under arrest. After
that the British authorities directed that people
like Johnston should be hanged or otherwise dis-
posed of in Sydney, and buried, if necessary, on
the premises.
N.S.W. State Government’s constantly
displayed jealousy of Greater Sydney is of a
pieee with its jealousy of Greater Australia.
With the Commonwealth on the one side to
attend to national matters, and effective municipal
organisation on the other to attend to civic
matters, the State Government would see its end
nearing.
WE DON’T THINK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tommy Bent complains that peace was denied him
through the holidays. Wherever he went his rest was
disturbed and his privacy violated by eager deputation-
isr.s and greedy people begging concessions. Tommy
claims he is the hardest-worked man in the Victorian
community. “ I sometimes envy the stone-breakers,” he
says.
A stone-heap by a country track,
And on it, bowed in dreary graft,
A fat man with an aching back,
And hands all blistered at the haft.
The toil is long, and hot, and hard—
The pay is one-and-six a yard !
The summer sun with vicious heat
Provokes intestinal alarms,
And fresh-burnt freckles, big as feet,
Emboss the worried “ broker’s ” arms,
While from the north the fiery gust
Embalms his many scars in dust.
He drinks warm water from the creek,
He nibbles at a brittle crust;
And yet the fat man does not seek
Commiseration of the just.
It is Tom Bent, and he is blest,
Enjoying simple peace and rest!

POLITICAL
POINTS
For over a fortnight Philp’s manifesto has
been advertised every day in Queensland papers.
The squatters came along with a tine fund for
expenses.
Dear Bulletin, — Be your leader on
smuggled Chinamen, why not order all the crew
and passengers on deck, and then fumigate the
ship and kill every living thing below —Chows,
niggers and rats? —Yours truly, HERCULES Anak.
Nowra (N.S.W.) water supply comes from
the Cambewarra Mountain, about seven miles
away. The dairy-farmers along the main have
pipes laid on to their farms. The Council charges
the great landlord of those parts Is. per 1000 gal-
lons. The great landlord charges the tenant-
farmers Is. 6d. At the beginning of last week
there was no water in Nowra, and taps could be
turned on in vain. But the supply was un-
diminished on the farms. Great is Cow 1 Also
great is the landlord ! Cow must be watered, and
the landlord must make his 6d. per 1000 profit
even though mere ordinary humans go dry.
BETTER SPORT AT SEA.
Mr. Reid is still fishing on the Victorian coast.— News Item.
MRS. UMBRELLAGRAP : “ Hi, you George, kem ashore at wunst; the country’s gon' to pot! I”
GEORGE: “My troubles about the country; call me again if the fish don't bite.”
Now and then Queensland has a chance of
seeing the real strength of the party that is
struggling to buy itself back into office. For
instance, George Washington Power, Philp candi-
date for Fortitude Valley, announces :
When a man joins a union he sells himself body and
soul to his union.
As Power is a member of the hide-bound lawyers’
trade-union, one wonders whether he got more
than tuppence out of his own deal. And, any-
how, when a man joins any community that has
popular government, he “ sells himself body and
soul ”in the same way—he has to be ruled by the
majority. The only men who object to that are
anarchists and outlaws. Which is Power ? Or is
he just the common or meadow variety of ass with
a fluent bray ?
The prize wheat-bag horror was found on
the wharf at Port Adelaide last Friday. It wasn’t
so much a bag as a monument. The height of this
tower of wheat was and it weighed 6101 b.
About 3£ of it would go to the ton. The miserable,
ill-paid wharf-lumper is expected to make himself
a wreck for life by carrying such things as this so
that some heartless brute of a farmer may save
2d. or so—the bag was really three bags in one,
and there was only one bottom seam and one top
seam to pay for instead of three of each.
Assuredly it is time for the Australian Parliament
to interfere in the matter, even though the dignity
of some State may be damaged by its action.
“The following,” says a Queensland
Eaper, “area few small items urgently required
y this goldfield at the present time ” :
Twenty thousand pounds to the Town Council for the
purpose of paying off its present liability, putting our
streets in order, and beautifying the same with shade
trees ; £lOO,OOO for a permanent water supply ; £300,000
for extension of the railway to Georgetown ; £50,000 to
develop our deep ground; £lOO,OOO for the erection of
smelters and refining works.
That district scents Philp and boodle in the air.
But, having a haunting suspicion about Philp, it
hints that it would like to deal with the gentleman
on a strictly cash basis, if he doesn’t mind. This
talk of cash-down is most annoying.
The Australian Government lost a China-
man a little while ago by being too kindly and
considerate. Two Chows appeared on a steamer
at a Queensland port, both armed with certifi-
cates which set forth that they were old residents
of Australia returning from a visit to China. One
seemed as if he might be genuine ; but the other
knew not a word of English, and didn’t know the
location of a single place in the Commonwealth,
and was a shocking joke in every way. He ought
to have been arrested at the Queensland port
where the fraud was discovered, but he was
booked for Melbourne, and on some foolish
technicality he was allowed to proceed, notice
being sent ahead that there was a humorous
heathen on board. But when the vessel reached
Melbourne —lo ! the humorous heathen wasn’t
there. In his place was a suave Chow who
spoke fair English, who could stand an
examination in Australian geography, and
who couldn’t imagine how any suspicion
could arise that he wasn’t the same Chow who
had been on board when the vessel first struck
Queensland. Nobody on board knew anything.
Nothing could really be proved. The changes
had been rung somehow and somewhere, but
evidence was lacking, and the Commonwealth
was once more bowled out.
The sort of thing you read in the Queens-
land back-country papers nowadays :
Mr. , one of the newly-appointed Justices of
the Peace, left Croydon last week per bicycle. As it was
thought possible he might be on a similar mission to the
one negotiated by Mr. , J.P., prior to the last election,
the Labor Executive immediately wired their agents,
warning them of ’s departure. All democrats away
from home are cautioned against signing any papers be-
fore travelling Justices of the —— brand.
Of all election swindles in Australia the Queens-
land postal-vote swindle is the worst; and if
Philp didn’t realise its scandalous possibilities
when he rushed out another batch of the necessary
Js.P., then all that can be said is that Philp is
an unfortunate man who doesn’t know how to
avoid the appearance of evil.
Those “ great natural resources ” that the
Freetrader is always telling Australia to culti-
vate —“ and never mind about exotic industries ”
have just had another great advertisement. In
the drought year (1902) the N. S. Wales wheat
harvest averaged I'2 bushels per acre; the year
after that it jumped to 17’5 bushels; after that it
bobbed up and down and landed at 6'2 bushels
for last harvest—the worst on record bar 1902.
And that doesn’t tell all the grievous tale, for last
year over 300,000 hopeless acres were “fed off”
or not reaped ; counting those in, the average was
only 5‘4 bushels, and the total quantity reaped
was barely 40 per cent, of the previous very
moderate harvest. For a great natural industry
wheat-growing in N. S. Wales is as slippery and
unreliable as a greased pig.
The midnight harvester has arrived in
S. Australia. Not content with working his men
from sunrise until after sunset, boss cocky has
affixed to his harvesting machine a small dynamo
which lights up a number of lamps, thus enabling
operations to be carried on until midnight, or all
night if desired. The laborer does the overtime
gratis—just to keep on friendly terms with the
boss, whose relations to his hired hands are mostly
those of “ friend to friend.” And such a thing as
the inclusion of agricultural workers under the
Arbitration Act or Wages Board Act is not to be
tolerated, as it would destroy the above-mentioned
friendship, and boss cocky really couldn’t stand
that.
They still work the Anti-Sosh bogey m
Queensland in the Philp interest, mostly in a
furtive way, and in awe-struck whispers. They
carefully don’t mention, of course, that it is Philp
who proposes to borrow barrow-loads of money
(if he can) and splash it around in railways and
other State-socialistic enterprises.
THE COMING TEST MATCH.
BEADY? PLAY!
It may do John Bull good to notice that
all his white dominions are just now up in arms
against the discolored brother. Western Canada
hits the brown man on the head with a stick,
whilst Eastern Canada proposes some measure of
restriction on his entry. S’Africa puts the
Hindoo on a dog-registration basis, and gaols him
if he objects. Australia is just now thinking out
ways of stopping the smuggled Chinaman. This
unanimity ought to teach even John Bull some
thing.
In an article on the price of milk, t’other
day, the violently anti-Sosh S. M. Herald pointed
out that the increased price was chiefly benefiting
Sydney’s two big distributing-agent cos., and
hinted that the State would have to step in on
behalf of the suppliers. But the paper didn’t
mention that the agent-parasite’s profit is only
the secondary stage of the trouble, since before
either he or the supplier gets consideration, the
landlord has to have his cut, in the foym of an
exorbitant rent. The Herald openly ehicourages
State interference with the distributor’s profits,
but at any suggestion in the shappof a land-tax for
like interference with the landlord’s profits it
emits the loud wail of the sorely-smitten female,
and talks tearfully of “robbery” and “confisca-
tion.” How a thing can be a boon and a blessing
and at the same time a misery and anathema and
the Plagues of Egypt is a problem the Herald
doesn’t resolve.
The tail-end of a recent speech by John-
son, M.H.R. :
Mr. Johnson concluded by expressing the hope that
the electors of N.S.W. would take a lesson from the past,
and at election times see that they had a better class of
politicians representing their State.
They will, Johnson, they will! The people of
N.S.W. are learning that lesson fast. At last
election they threw out Lonsdale, Conroy, and
Pumpkin Smith. They rejected Gibb and James
Graham. They reduced George Reid’s majority
from 3795 to 1234. Next time they may throw
out Johnson himself. Things are looking up, and
real Australians are taking the places of the little,
parish-minded Johnsons that have so long brought
N.S.W. into contempt.
Notwithstanding the steady wail to the
effect that the farmers are in danger of being
legislated out of existence, the Federated Farmers’
Organisation of Australia, which sat in Adelaide
last week, resolutely clamored for Socialism every
time. It decided that the Australian Government
should obtain, and make public at all post offices
in producing districts, cabled quotations for wheat
and other products. It followed this up by ignor-
ing the protests of one Cullen, from Westralia —
who prated of the good old system of Private
Enterprise—and unanimously arriving at the con
elusion that wheat elevators, both inland and at
the principal ports, should be erected by the
Government. And it was only by reason of this
same Cullen, of Westralia, and other hide-bound
conservatives that the motion that “ a
recognised system of grading of all produce
for export is necessary and desirable ” failed
to read “ grading of all produce by the
Government.” Nor did these producers who,
according to the anti-Australian press, are
being steadily driven from the land by the
machinations of the Labor Party, stop at this.
Ewers, the representative from N.S.W., moved
“that in view of the widespread and increasing
loss sustained by the producing interests through-
out the Commonwealth owing to the depredations
of rabbits, the Federal Government be urged to
offer a substantial reward, and extend reasonable
facilities and encouragement for the discovery of
an effective method of exterminating rabbits.”
The majority of the Conference was of the same
opinion, though one number mentioned “ State
Rights ” and wanted to hand the job over to the
State Governments. Whoever took it on, how-
ever, it was to be carried out on a strictly social-
istic basis. In practically everything that was
brought forward these tillers of the soil voted for
Socialism. The only thing they never voted for
was the Labor Party which advocates Socialism.
G. Reid tells interviewers that he will,
“in a fortnight,” give his opinion on the new
Defence scheme. By that time, he probably
reckons, the cat ought to have jumped. But as
usual Reid makes a mistake. There is more
glory in this world for the man who gets behind
the cat and shoves the animal hard.
Philp is a very disappointed man because
Kidston hangs so grimly to the Constitutional
side of this fight. Philp scattered round pro-
mises, and hoped Kidston would advertise them
for him; and, to his disgust, Kidston won’t take
them seriously enough to even attack them.
Cane-cutting—“the work no white man
can do ” (see Bruce Smith and the pro-nigger
party in general)—finished on the Clarence t’other
day, after a record season of 28 weeks. Not only
did white gangs keep going throughout, but one
put up a record for the district by drawing £ll2
per man. Other cheques were close up, and the
lowest panned out the respectable sum of £62 per
man.
Several firms of Melbourne manufacturers
sent their employees home during the latter part
of the blistering week in January, and three at
least—the Colonial Ammunition Co., Chas.
Atkins and Co., and T. B. Guest and Co. —paid
them in full for the lost time. There is no word
of any importers showing the same.consideration.
Significantly enough, it didn’t seem to be expected
in their case.
The difference between compulsory and
voluntary military service is illustrated by the
following Bathurst story, told with much glee by
a participator in the incident. An order was
issued calling on the Bathurst Mounted Rifles to
attend drill. But the weather was unfavorable,
and, worse still, there were rumors of war in the
air. After long consideration, one member put
his opinion in writing, but the letter was thought
too frank and was thrown in the wastepaper
basket. It was, however, rescued by another
member, who forwarded it to Captain Machat' .e,
and so the unique production reached the fight.
The letter ran :
Owing to the probability of a blanky war at no distant
date, Ideemit advisable not to take an active part in
military matters until the cloud has passed. I cannot
consequently comply with your request to attend drill
during the week, as there is no fun in stopping cold lead
to serve my country.
Wholly voluntary service has a habit of dropping
into that view of matters when work looks arduous.
THE OBVIOUS POLICY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is no need for Australia to waste money on a
navy. Japan (England’s ally) has a fine fleet.— Gist of
Sydney Telegraph's main argument against a National
Defence Scheme.
Japanese officers, when questioned, . . . remarked : “ It
is nothing. Our ships are always ready for war.” — Same
paper, Sl/11’08.
What though the war-cloud lowers in “ the East,”
And yellow men glare threat’ningly on white ;
Australia need not worry in the least—
She is all right.
Away off Yeddo, swinging end on end,
Lie Asian warships ripe for her defence ;
For these when danger threatens she shall send,
And save expense.
Plainly it were a thing to raise a laugh
That she should “blew” her hard-won coin on ships
When Japs are doing it on her behalf
Simply in whips.
Who but a fool would spend the cash that’s hard
On safes and things wherein to keep his pelf,
When Sykes (hight Bill) is on the spot to guard
The stuff himself !
Briefly, a nation’s practice (like a cit’s)
Should be for self-defence to care no rap,
But leave the job of keeping what is its
To t’other chap.

TALKING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Senator Neild has given notice of his intention to move
224 reductions in the schedule of the Tariff Bill when it
comes before the Senate. — Daily paper.
When the Tariff’s/o be done, of the crowd lam the one,
Only let me on the loose and see how I can reduce
Any duty ever made to a small, decrepit shade
Of itself by simply standing up and talking.
Yes, merely talking !
Long-distance talking !
You can do a lot by patiently a-talking !
’Neath the slow and steady drip of the product of the lip
(There’s no need to use the brain in this sort of dry cam-
paign)
All the store of Reason wears, and reporters fall down-
stairs
In despair, when I have really started talking t
My sort of talking !
Not common talking !
It takes stamina to listen to my talking !
I am massaging my “ jore ” for points two-twenty-four,
And I will not hold my breath till the Chamber’s still as
death
And the members all have gone and the sun shines in
upon
The great Senate I have emptied out by talking—
By endless talking !
By dreadful talking !
By exhausting, empty, paralysing talking !

SEMPER IDEM
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, January 27, 1908.
My Dear Arini,—
All the fun in this State rages in and around
Moss Vale. Spite of a shade temperature many
laps higher than that of Sydney, the annual ball
that always rolls in the rear of the Bong Bong
picnic races trundled to a moist but merry con-
clusion. Excellency Rawson was present, and as
he has no uniforms of unlined chiffon he must have
enjoyed himself sweltering on the dais. Excellen-
cette Rawson shimmeredin white satin. Mrs. Ewan
lteazer’s frock of radium satin with auriferous
embroidery was hotly picturesque. Mrs. Harry
Osborne and her sister, Mrs. Vallange, from
Melbourne, were present. Nearly every woman
wore silk disguised under various aliases. And
silk is such a sinful thing for conserving heat !
flour days after this annual broil, another dance
a plain and fancy episode, was held and attended
by many of the same people and a large number
of children, who cheerfully dressed them-
selves up as Swiss peasants, Sisters of
Mercy, stockmen, Beaucaires, or cricketers.
A young Bruce Smith girl would seem to have
.’‘a',' 1 a well-ventilated costume, for she went as
a Maori Lady.
It is a kind of mild pick-me-up to learn that the
Northcotes (like the daffodils) wili come before
the swallows are due, and fill the winds of March
with beauty Early in that month Federal
Government House, in Sydney, will be opened,
and their super-Excellencies will be once more in
residence iheir visits to the Rawsons, at Moss
Vale, and to the Chief-Justice Darleys, at
Eatoomba, came to an end last week. Then
they returned to Melbourne, where, as here the
sun shines on the august and non-august ’with
furious impartiality.
Mrs. Rupert Carrington (wife of ex-Governor
in M n y ° Unger br « thw ). who died last
week in Me!bourne, was the only daughter of J.
S. Horsfall one of N.S.W.’s squatter kings, and
owner of \\ ldgiewa,’ where the marvellous stud
sleep hve. She leaves a little son behind her,
and a husband who was a heap more devoted than
w a u erage ” lale s P° use who figures in Debrett.
Widgiewa is the show station-home of Aus-
tralasia. .Mr. Dick Horsfall, only son of the
squatter king, lives mostly in Sydney.
On a day, lately, that I read an article in a

read that a man had been found dead in a bush in
Australia, and, as she hasn’t heard of her brother
could I find out for her the name of the man who
died in a bush in Australia? To oblige the dis-
consoiate relative, who has put notices in Lloyd’s

As for the Australienne’s walk. Climatic
reasons may have something to do with it. When
your spine feels as sagging as your collar (if you
are fatuous enough to wear one) you do want to
lean up against something, even if it is only the

A cute idea for the transforming of Bridge into'
a bearable game for two has come on the market
Admittedly the ordinary double-dummy method
of play is uninteresting and dead as the soda-water
that was opened yester-week. You know as soon
as yo , u bave observed the 13 cards in your hand
and the 26 on the table exactly what your adver-
sary has, and you play accordingly. Wherefore
Surnev about n as , m "ch skill in the contest as in !
tourney at pitch and toss. By the new
scheme a couple of wooden stands, each about
.mn. in length, hold the dummy cards in light
ire clips. These stands are so placed that neither
pla y er can see the other’s hand. The lone female
who finds it hard to “ get a four,” but can always
unearth another as lone as herself, should receive
much solace from this fakement; and enough
practice to win quantities of pin, hat, and other
moneys from her brain-weary hubby in the hours
after the corpse of dinner has been carried away
to the cemetery of the kitchen. y
If Sydney doesn’t get out of the habit of being
rescued from drowning about every half-hour it
will have to abolish the Royal Humane Society’S
award to save itself from ridicule. Heroisn/is
becoming too commonplace lately to excite the
public, and the surf rescue is rapidly dwindling in
the press reports. This means less limelight for
the energetic rescuer; but the rescuer seems to
be as willing to plunge in and rub noses with the
shark as he was in the days when fame and a
medal and the adulation of the unfair sex waited
for him at the water’s edge. It is consoling tn
know that heroes are what the daily papers cal
rife in cur midst,” but we will have to give un
the practice of hanging bronze discs on them or
for copper^ 6 ® to th ® inhabita nts of N.S.W.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 27, 1908.
My Dear Yarrik,—
Melba is on the look-out for a girl with a really
fine voice. She believes that if she could lavish
her interest and hopes on a promising young Aus-
tralian, her own still distant dethronement
would be shorn of its sadness by the success and
triumph of her protege and self-chosen successor.
Miss Geva Stanley, grand-daughter of the
pioneer Carre-Riddells, was married on Thursday
to Colonel G. W. Dashwood, of the sth Fusileers
(Eng.), who came qpt to Victoria to collect his
bride. Archdeacon Crossley and the Rev. G.
Cole managed the knot-tying in All Saints, St.
Kilda (it is becoming fashionable to be tied by
two-parson power), and the cake was munched
at “ Cavers-Carre,” Elsternwick, where the 300-
odd presents were spread. Mrs. Madden and the
Janet dowager, and Justice This and Justice
That, and the Misses Justices, and crowds of
other legal Importants, headed the array of
guests. Two pretty Carre-Riddell daughters,
who own names like racehorses, Yolande and
Winona, were bridesmaids; also Cousin Nita de
Fegely. They were a rainbow trio round the
Point, and Duchesse, and Ninon, and fluttering
etceteras of the wonderful bridal gown. The
honeymooners have wandered into the country,
and leave for Fogland next month.
On one of the hottest of Melbourne’s recent
“blazers” a large woman puffed her way into the
Queen Victoria Hospital, and handed the doctor
a 12-months-old infant which appeared to be at its
last gasp. The doctor had been reviving heat-
affected babies all that week, and she diagnosed
the case at a glance. A drink of filtered water
resuscitated the threatened corpse ; then the doc-
tor removed its clothing to give it a cool bath.
She had got as far as the fourth flannel garment,
when she looked at the mother—as though to make
sure of her sanity, for the thermometer stood at
109 s . Mother was quite sane, but she had ideas of
her own. “Oh! I’m sure the poor lamb will
catch cold. I gave it a hot mustard bath just
before I brought it out.” She was handed her
revived infant and the four garments in a separate
parcel, and passed out with some much-needed
information on the management of children ; but
she probably forgot it all long before she reached
home.
The hardest-worked people during the recent
heat were the nurses —especially the girls in the
Melbourne Hospital. They had no time to think,
or rest, or even eat. They were fighting for lives.
From early till late heat-stroke cases were being
carried in. There were three distinct kinds of
heat apoplexy, each demanding its own particular
f(orm of treatment; and nurses, outwardly cool
and wonderfully quick, were nearly distracted
with the rush. An extra ward was opened up
without increase of staff. Now, with the change
in the weather, there are breakdowns that are un-
recorded.
Talking of hospitals—the young Queen Victoria
Women’s Hospital drives its sense of economy in
a harsh direction. There is one bathroom only for
the nurses, the matron and the resident doctors—
about fifteen people in all. I think even the
maids share this generosity. Fortunately the
patients are laved, by hosing down or something,
in other rooms.
Rumor —the inventive hussy—alleges that Mrs.
Wallace and her sister, Mrs. Parker, have booked
their passages for London, and leave within a
month. The beautiful lady enjoys a post-matri-
monial income of £5OO a year, and resumes her
maiden name.
That enterprising bogus aristocrat who did her
incognito dash with ingenuity in these parts had
some quaint fancies in her repertoire. One dis-
tinguished maiden boasts a volume of “Straw-
berry Leaves,” by A. Leaf, presented to her by
the Rose of the Abergavenny aliases, as “from the
author.” A local priest has a tale to tell of her
charities. She went to the cleric in a friendly way
and announced her Kerristian desire to do good.
She picked a few unfortunates out of his flock, and
instructed him to buy a bottle-oh cart for one,
a mangle for another, a bassinette for a third, and
so on. The man of masses did her bidding, and
sent along the invoices. But the lady had flown.
In Sydney she was the protege of a likeable doctor
who mixes spooks and squills in queer pro-
portions. He lent her his counsels, and a
seat at his table was her privilege. And she kept
in touch with the/clergy all the while. The bogus
lady had a bright imagination but tenth-rate
manners. While many dowagers accepted her
with open arms as a real live aristocrat, never a
servant who waited on her failed to aver : “ Garn,
she ain’t a real lady. She don’t know how to be.”
Frills satisfy the superior, where the lowly
demand real flesh and blood.
Sweet Nellie Stewart sends a plaintive scrawl to
a chum, and announces her imminent return to
Australia. Her health prohibits her continuing
active work for the present, and her spirits are at
low ebb. She says she hoped to crown her
laborious career with an Antipodean success, and
so add to Australia’s pride in her. Daughter
Nancy returns with her mother. Poor pretty
Nellie ! She is one of the few footlighters whose
goodness and charity need no exaggeration. There
are few people who have required kindness to
whom she refused it when it was within her reach.
The Robt. Kent couple and Mrs. Howard
(formerly Dora K.) go off on a dawdle through
the Straits Settlements and some other Asiatic
side-shows. This most devoted little family will
be missed by its coterie.
There is some unimportant news of popular
people. The Fred Bird womenkind jaunt abroad
next month. Some members of the John Cooke
family do likewise. The Philip Russells have
just come back from a prolonged wander. The
frocky half of that combination has some chiffony
trophies which could be eloquently described in
gamins’ patois as “snorters.” And Himself has
imported some Hinglish ideas upon “ squiring ”
the tenantry on his Colac estate. About
ten score other folks are going to sail across the
sea ’cos they can afford to, and twice as many
return ’cos they can’t afford to remain away.
I came across a quaint romance in an English
journal recently. It was in the form of an inter-
view with a chorus-girl, who first put on a buskin
in this town. To a much-impressed and very
young reporter the lady discoursed upon her
career. There was a minimum of labor re-
corded—and an unlimited number of frantic
love affairs. The love affairs were fine. One
of her crazed worshippers wrote her a letter
with a pig’s trotter, or something else exotic,
dipped in his own blood. And about fourteen
other youths, hard-bit by Venus, had strewn her
path with offers of marriage and raving declara-
tions that she could end their lives with a frown,
but their loves would live for ever. Such fatuous
blither is very characteristic of the minds
whose highest aspirations are to head a
theatrical programme. Fame for the female
mummer is expressed by the number of callow
boys who make themselves and her ridiculous.
Art for Art’s sake is an axiom without truth in
the world of make-believe. Anyhow, apart
from that side of the question, isn’t it rather in-
decent the way the grease-painted girl vaunts the
fact that her plump figure or her pretty face has
inspired a fool to folly ?
There is great excitement at St. Kilda nowa-
nights. Ratu Kadavu Pope and the other
Fijian cricketers are putting up at the Prince of
Wales Hotel in Fitzroy-street, and all the lovely
little white girls stand around and watch them
evoluting on the verandah. Last Sunday night
Ratu’s crowd were invited to one of the local
churches, and there, in an atmosphere of increas-
ing warmth, they gave themselves vent in
numerous nasal hymn tunes. Likewise, they were
pawed considerably, and called “ berruther ! ”
signifying that they had found merit in the eyes
of the Lord. Later, they returned in triumph
to their pub, and held a reception upon the
verandah, where they were pawed some more.
Indeed, one huge fellow was sitting comfortably
between two white women well in the shadow,
and they were deeply interested in one another.
Ugh!
Miss Ampt, who was drowned in the Yarra
recently, was shortly to have married young
Watsford, brother-in-law of Dr. Basil Kilvington,
the rising Victorian surgeon, whose experiments
and conclusions with regard to extra-spinal nerve-
grafting have already made his name known in
European scientific circles as one likely to unearth
something new in the field of original research.
The Watsford clan is at present overwhelmed
with bereavements. Two young daughters, a
youthful daughter-in-law, and the head of the
family, “ Daddy Watsford,” a pioneer Methodist
parson, have died within the last few months.
Of the two sons, the elder, a disconsolate
widower, has been sent abroad by the doctors
in wretched health, and his brother is now
mourning the loss of his fiancee.
Two obdurate local doctors are at last marked
for matrimony. Dr. Balfour, son of Hon. James
Balfour, is to marry Miss Eyres, of Ballarat.
The bridegroom-to-be has literary leanings and
won praise for his account of his kinsman,
Robert Louis Stevenson, in the latter’s Samoan
home. His fellow surrenderer, Dr. Armstrong,
of Canterbury (Melb.), is to wed Miss Grieve, a
philanthropic and wealthy lady.
The summering Macedonians had a narrow
escape from a gory sensation last week. The
Smith motor and the Whiting horse turnout met
at a bridge where there was a nasty turn in the
road. The motor remained quite calm, but the
horses did a cakewalk, and one jumped clear of
the traces and started to vent its indignation on
the auto. A cowering heap of femininity waited
for the overturn. But “Bob” Whiting spends
much time playing about with some hundreds of
half-broken gee-gees on his Barcoo run, and he
brought a cool hand and head into the matter,
and motor, women and horses were soothed into
something like order. Whereupon the woinen-
kind took it for granted that the coolness of dear
“Bob” had preserved them from a shocking
decease, and wept on his bosom more or less.
The Writers’ Club spread itself in the inevitable
tea-party to farewell a member —Miss Glover.
The lady dabbles in pennery, but the serious
exertion of her life has been holding up the busi-
ness end of the most successful private hospital in
East Melbourne. So successful, indeed, is the
private hospital that Miss Glover is retiring in the
bloom of youth and wealth.
Someone remarked that there are two microbes
flying round just now—divorce and girl-babies.
The girl-baby is in the huge majority among
infants. Just at the wind-up of the year Her
Majesty’s Theatre (or the wives of the officials
thereof) scored no less than ten girl-babies—all
“ born of a Sunday.” Treasurer Tait’s firstborn
was in the lead. The most imposing girl-baby up
to date is the week-old daughter of Clarence
Weber, who is already stretching her small
muscles and cogitating a system of “ culture.”
Still another judicial separation. The plea is
desertion, which argues that the parties have been
injudicially separated for some time. The de-
serter being a scion (glorious word) of a would-be
noble house, the affair is slipping hurriedly and
noiselessly through the Court, like a respectable
spectre in an ancestral castle. He (the deserter
—not the spectre) is one of a trio of daredevil
brothers who were all inclined to jamboree
occasionally.
It is amusing to watch the fluctuations of the
Theatre Royal audiences. At one time a Theatre
Royal house—a Bland Holt audience —was a thing
in itself, unique, differing in all essentials from
the Andersonian crowd. The Beatty-Mclntosh
invasion brought a swagger element.' They got
in the way of’Liza and her bloke, or Ma and
the girls who sit in the stalls and crunch
sweets and giggle at the “ comic relief.”
The elements mix rather badly. T’other night
Toorakia spread itself in a theatre party with
much subdued rustle of silk and unsubdued
chatter, and great gleam of shirt front. One of the
befrilled maidens and her attendant johnnie
were much perturbed at the next-seat neighbor—
a woman with a “stuff ” dress, a squashed straw
hat, and a huge baby. The matronly one disap-
peared at intervals into the dim dusk of the outer
aisle to refresh the huge baby from Nature’s font
(as Mr. Micawber would have said), and came
cheerfully and noisily back to her point of vantage
for more “ bellow.” The left flank of the swagger
party was bordered by a thirsty citizen, wlio
stood up, swaying gently, and silently copied the
dramatic gestures of the mummers. When re-
monstrated with, he pleasantly patted the sleek
parted hair of his neighbor and begged him to
“ nem-m-mind.” Then a quartette of officials
bore him gently and logfully away, and Toorakia

ful gowns.
The Tryphena of “Melbourne Chatter” in
The Bulletin, who became converted into Lady
Doughty after her arrival in England, has been
contributing Saturday essays to the Grimsby
Telegraph— Grimsby being a shipping town
where the name of Doughty sounds very like the
name of God. Her old Australian friends can
hardly believe that it is indeed Tryphena —dis-
guised under her matrimonial appellation—who
discourses lengthily on the subject of “oppor-
tunity ” in the Grimsby Telegraph. She starts
with a quotation from Bacon, passes from Bacon
to Shakspeare, and proceeds to instance Cin-
cinnatus, Cromwell, Napoleon, and other weighty
personages of the past as adroit manipulators of
every opportunity that came along. All of which
looks very like a veiled tribute to the genius of
the self-made shipowner and politician who had
the honor of annexing one of Australia’s tallest
and brainiest daughters last year. He has been a
seizer of opportunities—including Tryphena.

“ Mario” writes from Brisbane :
There has been a small outbreak of gaiety in our midst
this week. Tempted by the wonderful coolness, folks
came out of their shells and disported themselves o’
nights. The first outbreak was the band concert, at the
Exhibition grounds, where the 9th A.I.R. gave its second
open-air performance. The affair was “ in the presence
of Lord Chelmsford,” but the shadowy potentate
suffered partial eclipse by reason of the presence of
Roger Hartigan. Around Roger and his halo every-
thing feminine fluttered. Masculine interest centred
upon Miss Elbert Orton. During the period the Aorangi
was coaling at Pinkenba the lady tripped up to town and
took tea with Major and Mrs. Hopkins. I don’t fancy his
pallid Ex. minded his eclipse much, for he chatted to the
handsome stage lady most affably. I fancy they must
have discovered a mutual long-lost brother. In the crowd
I saw Mrs. Robert Philp “fluffing ” on politics with Big-
john Forrest, while the handsome Rankin sisters flitted
round with a host of other girls.
On Thursday night there was a big roll-up at the Cen-
tennial Hall, and bonnie Marie Narelle received a welcome
which must have set her warm heart glowing. The audi-
ence shouted itself hoarse. Miss Narelle’s programme
was as Irish as Patrick’s hog, and contained such well-
known gems as “ The Low-Backed Car,” “ Wearin’ of the
Green,” “ Killarney,” “ O’Donnel Aboo,” and “The Meet-
ing of the Waters.” The singer was in splendid voice,
and if the house hadn’t been carefully propped up she
would have brought it down. She sang 15 songs, got tons
of flowers, and made a big hit. The audience matched
the programme. There were the O’Dwyers, the O’Sheas,
the O’Donnels, the Maguires, the Sheelas, and the
Thynnes, with just a streak of Murphy and Byrnes.
On Saturday, interest was equally divided between the
rowing-shed and the races. At the latter, a blazing sun
kept the womenfolk in the stand or under the trees (it
was the first hot sun for a month). Certain inconsist-
encies in the racing glared even more than the sun.
When one small jockey was hauled up before the stewards
and asked how it was that his mount, which couldn’t get
nearer than last in the second race, managed to waltz
home in the fourth, with 81b. more to carry, he just
looked blank and said, “ I’m blest if I know. You’d
better ast the ’orse.” His air of innocent amazement
saved the situation.
Miss Violet Newton is busy packing her boxes to depart
Fogwards at an earlier period than she anticipated. The
haste is due to a cable from her future husband, Pay-
master Woodman, who just can’t wait another instant for
his bride.
Handsome Mrs. Jim Robertson is at present flitting
round your bonny city, staying at the Wentworth. She
complains bitterly of the heat, and goes Bowralwards
during the coming week. Another doleful wail comes
from Bob Kaye, our premier conductor, who was holiday-
ing in Melbourne. He has fled, melting, to Macedon. On
the contrary', those of our trippers who have sought our
own lovely Blackall Ranges, and such places, bring back
refreshing tales of cood nights, breezy days, and heaps of
raspberries. We are having the best fruit season for
years, and you can sit on your own doorstep and eat of the
best grapes in the land at Id. a pound, to say nothing of
peaches, unlimited pines, and mangos galore.
From “ Rosna,” in the land of horse-trams :
Regardless of heat waves, our S. Australian Excellency
issued from his summer seclusion to be the guest of the
von Doussas at Mount Barker, t’other Saturday, and a
large he-party spent the day shooting the doughty quail.
Talking of he-parties reminds me of something rather
neat in the way of dinner decorations. The occasion was
a selfish bachelor spree at a costly hotel, and the tem-
perature was of the kind that isn’t mentioned except in
church when the parson is issuing a strenuous warning to
sinners. All ornamentation was carried out in ice. A
fetching centre-piece was made of huge blocks that
crossed and re-crossed each other like a fortification ; and
electric fans were a-whirl all round the ice, and shovelled
the cool atmosphere gaily through the room.
Bishop Thomas and his wife are rejoicing over the birth
of a daughter, the first arrival. Their predecessors in
this See boasted a similar achievement after about the
same term of residence in South Oss. Both couples
arrived in Adelaide during the honey-period, though a
honeymoon does sound a frivolous occupation for a
bishop.
The night before their departure for the Edward
island, the Prices were farewelled at Glenelg. The
Mayoral Varleys hosted the entertainment, and the local
Town Hall was put into its best clothes, and several hun-
dred of the haughty populace bidden to it. It was a
festive and frocky ceremony, for Glenelg-on-the-Pata-
walonga is a town of considerable pretension, where
the shekel aboundeth. The Mayoress was garbed
in pretty white silk raiment, while Mrs. Price
sported an ultra frock of palest grey silk voile. All the
local celebrities and their feminine belongings were there,
including the Speaker Coleses, the Chief Secretary Kirk-
patricks, the O’Loughlins, and throngs more. Speeches
and compliments flew in all directions. The Premier and
Premieress had their healths drunk with musical honors ;
and the whole multitude fell on their necks, and implored
them with tears in its voice to come home quickly.
Pretty' well every celebrity we can rake up farewelled
the pair again at the train and wharf next day. Her Ex.,
who spent the heat wave at Marble Hill, sent a note
wishing them good luck, and the Chief Justice Ways went
along with a gorgeous floral offering for Mrs.' Price.
Likewise were there Speaker Coles and his dame, Mavor
Johnson, Deputy-Postmaster Waddy, the Crown Solici-
tor, Commissioner of Police, 'the President of
everything in the State with his wife and his secre-
tary, all the Ministry and its wife, and all the
Assembly with its life partner. At Port Ade-
laide the Prices W'ere commandeered and carted off to the
Town Hall for more health drinking and rhetoric. Then
a favored few took the Premier by the hand and led him
to the waiting Narrung, where there were more vegetable
offerings and gifts hurled at the travellers. Fi nailv the
crowd sang “Down the River,” “We Parted on the
Shore,” and other fitting refrains. We’re not to have an
acting-Premier after all, because it has been discovered
that we can’t. Somebody has stubbed his toe in the dark
on a statute that forbids it.
Bush fires have been painting the country red with a
wild flickering brush, and much of the peerage has been
chased back to town from its rural rnusings with its hair
singed and an old cinder in its eye. Town is a very deadly
spot, too, all social matters having been cremated in the
heat wave. We haven’t even had a funeral of any im-
portance to cheer us up. At the theatre “Miss Lanca-
shire, Limited” is doing well. Although 35., 2s. and Is.
are not usually considered prices worthy of the peerage's
Attention, that jaded body has come down from its perch
‘or want of anything else to do. Besides, the perch was
so hot that the peerage’s feet couldn’t stand it any longer,

AUSTRALIAN Tweeds ?
I N SHORT, why support any Australian industry that employs only a handful of men as
* compared with the hordes engaged in manufacturing for the world’s markets ? Have you
ever figured it out ? Say an industry only finds employment for 300 men. Those 300 may
be safely computed at a low estimate to number 900 dependents, or a total of 1200 souls.
Now these 1200 souls are helping to make up the trade or business of another 1200
butchers, bakers, tailors, hatters, drapers, grocers, milkmen, landlords, hotelkeepers, insurance
(life and fire), doctors, lawyers, barristers, chemists, farmers, nurses, stationmasters, tramway
gripmen, porters, tram conductors, cabmen, judges, ad infinitum , and their dependents. I hat
is to say, the 300 grows into 2400, thus :
300 workers.
900 dependents.
Total 1200
1200 butchers to judges and their dependents.
t
Total 2400
And as the Commonwealth and State Revenue in NEW SOU TH WALES ALONE
runs to about per head, we have (TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND
POUNDS) sterling per annum, or per head flowing out of those 300 men engaged
in the 300-hand industry, which men some bright intellects would pension off so as to mciease
the (approximate) that Australia sends abroad yearly for goods that could be
just as easily produced in Australia.
But the Woollens Industry of Australia employs many more than 300 hands, and
MARRICKVILLE TWEEDS are the finest in the world because they are made
ALL OF WOOL, and Nothing' But Wool,
and, as employing Australian workmen, and manufacturing our great raw staple Wool into
Woollens, they should at least have a trial—they need nothing else. Once worn, always worn.

GEORGE J. COHEN, Chairman.
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
A. J. SOUTAR, Accountant.
Sydney, 13th January, 1908.
We hereby certify that we have examined the bills, compared the balances and counted the coin in the Head
Office of THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY, LIMITED, and have compared the returns of
the Branches, and have found the same as specified in the foregoing Balance-sheet.
The following resolutions were carried unanimously
E. S. CAPE,
F. W. HIXSON,
Auditors.
“ That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated among
the Proprietors.”
“ That the thanks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers of the
Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.”
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
In moving the adoption of the report, the chairman, Mr. G. J. Cohen, said “In presenting to you to-day our
balance-sheet for the past half-year, I have the pleasure of again being able to congratulate you upon a substantial
expansion of the bank’s business. Compared with those of twelve months ago, the tota'i figures of the balance-sheet
show an increase from £18,564,000 to £20,191,000. This, you will find, is made up on the debit side of the balance-
sheet by an expansion of the deposits of the bank from £14,360,000 to £15,985,000, being an increase of £1,625,000 by
increase of capital of £246,000, by additions to reserve fund of £84,000, and an increased note circulation of £53,000.
Bills in circulation, however, show a decrease of £401,000, which is due to the ordinary fluctuations of trade.
Turning to the credit side, our coin and bullion and cash at bankers together have increased £806,000, further satis-
factory investments in Government securities are responsible for £73,000, while f bills receivable in London and
remittances in transit show an increase of £441,000. The liquid assets as a whole show an increase of £442,000, and
are equal to 10s. 4d. in the £ against the bank’s liabilities to the public. Bills discounted and all debts due to the
bank have increased from £9,391,000 to £10,556,000 ; this increase of £1,164,000 is accounted for by the investment in
Australia of monej's withdrawn from London. The reserve fund will now stand at £1,219,000 ; this, with the un-
divided balance, makes a total of £1,248,000, an amount in excess of the present paid-up capital of the bank. You
will notice that the bank premises account has been increased by £19,975 during the past half-year. This is less
than the amount expended on new premises account, but in accordance with our usual practice, we have written off
a large amount for depreciation.
“ The shareholders will note in the report a reference to the general manager’s gift of £5OOO for the benefit of
the officers of the bank, the interest of which is to be devoted to relieve cases of sickness or misfortune. Already
two deserving officers, suffering from severe illness, have been assisted by the fund. -The directors, to show their
appreciation of the gift, and the good that will result from such a fund, in the interests of the bank and its officers
have set aside the sum of £5OOO in augmentation of it, the interest only on which at 4 per cent, per annum is to be
used for the objects already stated. This action we believe will meet with your hearty approval. In conclusion, I
might state that there now remains to be received only £3825 of the authorised extension of capital, although the
fourth and last call is not due till March 31 next. I now beg to move that the report and statements of accounts be
received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated among the proprietors.”

“P 3”: Among the patents granted in New
South Wales is one to a Ph.l)., of Giessen, Germany, for
an alleged invention relating to the electrolytic extrac-
tion of metals. Without apology, or excuse, or explana-
tion the following occurs on the first page of the doctor’s
specification : “ The process is thought to be of great
value in less civilised countries, for instance (1) English
colonies” (and Australia is mentioned as one on the
seventh page). The patentee gives his address as No. 36
Frankfurterstrasse, which is terribly suggestive of
sausage and sauerkraut, and narrow streets and a limited
view. Anyway, while the German chemist may have
very advanced ideas in regard to the action of cupric
chloride upon metallic sulphides, he thinks of Australia
only as a land containing metalliferous deposits, adven-
turers, and niggers. What puzzles me is how the patent
authorities came to issue the insult—l mean the patent.

“Nym”: Kiddies round by Codville, on the
Big Trickle, are making good pocket money by cultivating
worm-crops and selling their wriggling produce by the
tinful to worm-danglers out keeping holiday. One worm-
grower has earned 30s. in three weeks supplying anglers
with his wares. The worm-kid’s modus operandi is to
lay damp bags over the worm-haunts, and douse with
water morning and night; worms come from far and
near, and are dug out. An oyster-tin two-thirds full of
bait commands 25., and the supply is quite unequal to
the demand. Notwithstanding the prevalence of spoon-
bait trailing—one of the finest physical exercises in
existence—there is an increasing demand for mussels,
yabbies and grey frogs on the part of holiday-makers,
week-enders, tourists and summer girls. Hence the
Truancy Act is much evaded by school kiddies keen on
the lucre trait. Half-a-crown’s value in yabbies can be
caught in an hour in any dam around Codville, while
freshwater mussels —to be scooped out of some holes in
the Campaspe by the hundreds—bring 3d. a dozen, and
are reckoned cheap at that 1
“P.G.8.”: How these importers love the
foreign article ! MarkFoy’s new Sydney building, accord-
ing to S. M. Herald (Jan. 7), will be practically foreign
from roof to cellar. The firm is even importing mud
(glorified under the name of glazed bricks, but mud
nevertheless) from Glasgow. Bangor slates will cover
the iniquity ; the lead and glass come from Leeds ; steel
framework from Belgium (haven’t I heard something of
a place called Lithgow?); the awnings and some new-
fangled merry-go-round sort of staircase come from Paris ;
some other fancy sort of glass fakement from the Con-
tinent of Europe. Apparently the only things not being
imported are the atmosphere and the Sky-line and the
Australians who are expected to roll up at the shop and
pay for it all.
He was a prop merchant. He had red hair and
a thin horse attached to a rickety cart loaded with props,
and every now and then he put his hand to his mouth
and roared, “ P-r-r-r-aps ! ho-ho-ho ! P-r-r-r-aps ! ” The
“ ho-ho !” wasn’t a laugh, for the prop merchant was an
intensely serious man who couldn’t see anything funny
in selling props. It was a little trick of his own invention
to help out the word “props.” He found it necessary
to have some sort of descriptive yell, because short-
sighted people now and then made determined attempts
to buy oysters from him. So he wended his way through
the city—where nobody ever bought such things—shout-
ing, “P-r-r-r-aps !” (he called it “praps”) “ho-ho-ho!
P-r-r-r-aps ! ”
A man with a glazed eye leant out of a hotel, and asked
in a pained voice, “ P’r’aps wot, ol’ chap ? ”
“ What d’ mean ?” snarled the prop merchant, stop-
ping.
“ P’r’aps wot ?” repeated the gentleman with the eye,
impatiently. “ What d’yer mean by goin’ ’bout singin’
out, ‘ Praps, oh ! ’ Praps? Whash it all ’bout? Whasher
matter '! ”
“ It means,” said the prop merchant, with bitter polite-
ness, “ it means ‘ praps.’”
“ Yesh, but p’r’aps wot ? ”
“ PRAPS ! You ’eard wot I said ! ”
“Yesh, ’course I did! But ‘p’r’aps’ by itself isn’t
sense, ol’chap. It sounds damn silly to hear man goin’
down street singin’ out ‘ P’r’aps ’ and nothin’ after it!
Whasser rest o’ sentence ? ”
“ Ah-h-h igo t’ blazes ! PRAPS ! CLOTHES-PRAPS !
same’s on th’ cart! Now d’yer see ? ”
The puzzled gentleman turned and regarded the cart
with a fixed stare. Then he looked reproachfully at the
merchant and said : “ “ Why don’ yer call ’em props, ol’
chap ?”
The ferocity of the merchant’s reply shocked the man
with the eye. He hung on to the door for a full minute
gazing after the merchant as he walked down the street
leading his dead steed and shouting his war-cry. Then
he muttered angrily to himself, “ Well, why th’ devil
don’t yer say ‘ props ’ ? ”

“ J.G.” : Agree with “Broadaxe” (B. 19/12/’O7)
about the shocking waste of good timber by sleeper-
hewers. The box forests around Bendigo are littered
with the decaying remains of thousands of good trees,
felled by sleeper-hewers, who have chopped perhaps one,
or two, and in very rare cases three sleepers out of a tree.
Yet if the same trees had been sawn up, more than a
dozen sleepers could have been obtained in most cases,
besides other serviceable timber. One serious result of
the criminal waste is that there is now a famine in
fencing posts, and the cocky lays himself out to do a little
extra bit of sweating to make up for it. The Victorian
Government has lately blocked sleeper-hewers from
chopping good trees into chips, but it is too late ; and,
anyhow, the Victorian action has merely driven the
sleeper-getters to attack the forests of the other States
with more ferocity than ever.

How they pass out. Three or four years ago a
quartette of strong, healthy Australian lassies met to-
gether in a dressmaker’s shop in a Victorian country
town, where they toiled at the noble art of rag-tacking.
Later, they went their several ways into the world. But
the seasons had scarcely changed when No. 1 passed out
—consumption. Shortly afterwards No. 2 went the way
of all flesh—consumption. No. 3 lingered a while, and
then hearkened to the clear call—consumption. And a
few weeks ago the Australia that so badly needs popula-
tion lost the fourth (and last) of the party—also a victim
of consumption. Dressmaking may be a genteel occu-
pation, but if this is what it leads to it were better that
feminine Australia just wrapped itself in a large square
piece of cloth, and tied a cord round its middle, and
went forth that way,

“F.H.R.”: There are many ways of earning
the nimble shilling, but for diversity of occupations I
challenge the world with a Sydney woman. She grows
ducks and fowls, sells flowers, does washing and ironing,
and takes in the State infant. She also adds a little to
her banking account by the hiring of her stud William
goat, and two evenings a week she holds a “ sceance,”
where many people, mostly women, enjoy the thrills of
dancing tables, lurid lights and unsatisfying conversa-
tions with mouldy spirits. She informed me that the
“ sceances ” were always opened by the hymn, “Angels
Hovering Round.”
THE GRATEFUL SAVAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lord Cromer, speaking at Glasgow yesterday, claimed
that Freetrade is a safeguard against the creation of huge
Trusts like those of America. The adoption of Protection
or preference would stimulate Anglophobia throughout
the world. — Cable.

His idol bowed before,
And bumped—as foolish persons should —
His forehead on the floor.
“ Great god,” he mumured from the dust,
While droned the big tom-tom,
“Content I be whene’er I see
The things you guard me from !
“ Prosperity’s a dreadful curse ! ”

“No robbers come to take my purse

If I were rich (my thanks I cry !)
On me would fall the Trust;

I buy from tribes next door,
Because they’d come on large, flat feet
And with me wipe the floor
If e’er I dared to grow my own—

Thus I contrive to keep alive
And save a deadly feud.
“ O god ! ” he raved, with joy distraught,
“ This gift is undeserved !
Favored am I by having nought,
For so I am preserved.
Therefore I render thee my thanks —
’Tis all I have. Ah me ! ”
And then in haste went forth to snare
A water-rat for tea.

Interior of an Imported Piano. The keyboard nnd action have been removed, and the string's taken out so as to show the relation of
the iron frame to the wrest-plank. On the board resting on top of the instrument is shown the sheet of brass winch covers the wrest-plank and which is
intended to protect it against the effects of climate. In some pianos the iron frame is continued over the wrest-plank, and holes are drilled through the
frame and the pins held in the wooden wrest-plank, as usual.

AN IMPORTANT ADVANCE
IN PIANO CONSTRUCTION.
The Beale-Vader Patent
Iron Wrest- Plank,
DURING the whole history of piano-making, the great fault recog-
nised by piano manufacturers has been that the instrumints
would not remain in tune or at pitch for any length of time, and
strenuous efforts have accordingly been made in the direction of
correcting that fault, the cause of which lies in the use of wood instead of
metal in a certain part of the piano called the “ wrest-piank.” The wrest-
plank is that part of the instrument in which the pins are held to which
the wires, or “strings” are attached. Mr. Edgar Brinsmead, of
Messrs John Brinsmead and Sons, London, writing on the
subject, sa.vs in his book, “ The History of the Pianoforte ”
!• The wires (or strings) are held by metal wrest-pins, around which
the strings are wrapped in two or three coils. The pins are then driven
tightly into holes prepared in a ‘ wrest-piank,’ made of wood, and the
tuning is effected by turning the pins, and thus winding the strings
around them, so as to increase the strain and raise the pitch ; or, turning
the pin backwards, and thus unwinding the pins and lowering the pitch.
These pins are held by the friction occasioned by the tightness with which
the fibres of the wood press around them, and to turn them great force, is
required. In tuning, the movement must be very slight, as the diameter
of the pin coils and strains the strings so rapidly that a thirtieth part of a
revolution is sufficient to raise some noles about half a tone. The tuner
has, therefore, to turn the pin backward and forward until he finds the
required tension, and even then this primitive plan neither secures nor
retains accuracy , for no material more suitable than wood has been used
for this process, and the wood occasionally splits , frequently loses its
ho ding power, is invariably affected by climatic changes, and especially is
t his the case in hot climates ; and when the loss of power is aggravated
l a the pin being turned forward and backward in tuning [thus loosening
t\ pianos cannot remain in tune, the tendency of the strings being to
pull the- pins Toumt and uncoil themselves , whilst nothing* but groat
holdingf-power will prevent them from doing* so.
_ 2. The wooden wrest-planks are liable to come away from their
fixings, the strain on these planks varying from 16 to 30 tons.”
As already stated, strenuous efforts have been made to overcome
these disadvantages ; in Germany, America, England, France, Austria—
in every land where pianos are manufactured—devices intended to supply
this want are patented almost every week. But not one of these attempts
has proved entirely successful, and the fact remains that by all makers
other than ourselves the wrest-piank is still made of wood.
But we have effectually overcome the difficulty which has so long defied
the best endeavors of the leading piano-makers of Europe and America.
Our invention, Beale-Vader Patent, is simplicity itself. Instead
of introducing a wrest-pin from the front, driven into wood like a nail, as
described above, we introduce a steel pin from the back, fitted nicely into
a hole drilled in a solid metal plate. The plate is a part of the usual iron
frame. The pin has a conical butt fitting a conical shoulder in the drilled
hole. A tension screw (or stud) presses the pin against the shoulder, thus
controlling the pin and imparting any desired tension. The strain of the
string is taken up securely by the iron frame. That is all.
With the wooden wrest-piank the pin crushes some of the fibres in
front, thereby causing a certain looseness or space where the pin should
fit tightest.
Another great advantage is that our new steel wrest-pin turns with
perfect smoothness during the operation of tuning, so that' the tuner can
arrive with ease and accuracy at the pitch desired. With the wooden
wrest-piank he always finds more or less j'erkiness, because of the indis-
pensable pinch of the wood, aided by the resin usually introduced. With
our patent he is provided with smooth metal surfaces, which are lubri-
cated so as to assure ease of operation.
A still greater advantage is that as the tension-screw perfectlv
controls the pin, which it touches only at a point, the latter will remain
absolutely and permanently at any desired strain, thus conferring the
boon of full and correct pitch.
But, above all, the advantage of permanence in tune is attained bv
the Beale-Vader Patent in so far as that can be possible. Piano strings
are made by drawing wire from cast-steel ingots. It is true that these
strings may be said to stretch at first, because they are really
straightening. For that reason all our instruments are months at full
strain before issue. Under the Beale-Vader Patents the piano receives for
the first time a complete internal iron frame above and below. The
instrument is, therefore, rendered durable beyond all others in respect of
tune, quality of tone, and generally.

The accompanying illustrations show clearly the construction of the
Beale Pianos and of imported pianos in respect of the tuning- system.
By referring to the engraving of the Beale-Vader patent tuning
system, it will be seen that the tuning-pin sits firmly in the cylindrical
barrel drilled to receive it. The screw is not affected by the pin, because
the latter touches it only at one spot.
Complete Pianos may be seen at any of our Showrooms, constructed
upon the above system, and we cordially invite you to’inspect and test
them before buying elsewhere.
The Beale Pianos are superior in quality to the imported, which
is a strong reason for their being made here; otherwise tve would make
them in Germany, w'here we can get all the labor and skill at much lower
wages, and where the hotlrs are longer. But we have the best skill pro-
curable from all parts of the world, the best materials, and our own
patents. There are no recorded patents in Australia by foreign piano-
makers, so we have all improvements open to us. Our workshops are
large and new, fitted w-ith ateampipes throughout, and the most modern
electrically-driven machinery and apparatus. The climate is all in our
favor. In Germany, for many months in the year, the workshops are
•tightly closed, whilst often icicles hang from the roof. Inside there is a
close atmosphere at about 62 deg. The rooms are moist with breath, and
the steam from glue-pots. The pianos are jointed up, sounding boards
and all, in such conditions, which are unavoidable. Then in the same
atmosphere they are finished and packed. Yet in three months’ time
such pianos must withstand, 'if they can, an Australian open-air dry
temperature of 110 deg. in the shade. Which is likely to endure these
conditions best? Pianos made in Germany, or Pianos made here by-
skilled workmen, with added experience and every possible appliance at
hand, in this climate ?

Tiieib Symptoms and Cube.
Every child suffers more or less from intestinal
worms. Indeed many adults are troubled with
this complaint, but fail to realise the fact. The
symptoms of this trouble are various, but are
usually very pronounced. Constant irritation of
the nostrils, and the biting of the finger nails are
sure signs of the presence of worms. In variably the
sleep is greatly disturbed with grinding of the
teeth, and an excessive flow of saliva. Comstock’s
“ Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are a sure death to
worms and a perfectly safe remedy for children
and adults.

Among the things that Melbourne might
profitably have learned after its six days of stifle
and sweat was that its morgue, through the doors
of which 25 bodies passed in 48 hours, was not yet
sewered, and that the water continuously sprayed
on the subjects ran straight to the pellucid Yarra.
Numerous of these late lamenteds had been post-
mortemed, and were awaiting the Coroner’s
attentions on Monday. When that official sat in
the room just behind the death chamber the state
of affairs was such that witnesses rushed outside,
and had to be hollered for when wanted. It might
be imagined that the morgue would have been
about the first place in Melbourne to be sewered ;
even if Bent was negligent one would think the
Board of Health or the City Council’s health
officer would have remonstrated ere this. Pos-
sibly they did, and possibly Bent procrastinated.
Bent has been too busy pursuing the halo that
Treasurers make out of surpluses to do the neces-
sary work of sewering the morgue, Parliament
Houses, the gaols, and other institutions, and he
hasn’t had time to keep the State schools and
teachers’ residences in order. Surpluses are good
things to have about the premises, but, like the
Cow-cocky’s competence, they can be paid for too
dearly.
Diet in the Nueseey.— The wise and well-
informed mother who wishes to rear a family of strong-
boned, muscular children, does not feed them with foods
that merely produce superflous flesh without muscle and
bone. Good butter and milk can never be too
largely used because they are natural foods, and of
universal value. Meat does not need to enter largely
into the feeding of children, but a small quantity of oat-
meal once a day is invaluable. Salt should be used when-
ever practicable, and the best for all purposes is
“ Cerebos,” because of the phosphates it contains.*
Bendigo has floated a “ South African Re-
turned Soldiers’Association” which is “to em-
brace all the State of Victoria, and have branches
in the different districts.” The first object
Association, according to its documents, is “ to
foster a spirit of loyalty to the King, and cultivate
an Imperialsentimentof patriotism.” Ithas numer-
ous other objects, and asecond is worth mentioning:
‘‘To lend a helping hand to deserving members
who have fallen on evil days.” Recollecting the
number of “returned empties” who have fallen
upon evil days—running into years of gaol in some
cases—the Association is wise in limiting its help-
ing hand to “deserving” members. If the help-
ing hand were extended indiscriminately, the
Association might presently be up to its neck in
trouble for throwing tobacco over the prison walls.

NOTIONS
As The Bulletin goes to press the 80th
N.S.W.-Victoria match progresses on the Sydney Cricket
Ground, and the book discloses that, of 79 which are
history, N.S.W. has gathered 42 and Victoria 37;
also that every one of eight games played during
the past four years is to the elder State’s
credit. Trumper is sick and Hopkins fills his place.
Cricket nowadays is such a lengthy affair that this paper
almost always goes to press with an unfinished match on
its soul. It is so in this case, and an unfinished match is
a dreary and unsatisfactory thing to criticise. The Vic-
torians went in first and oame out with their aggregate tail
absolutely perpendicular. They had made 402, of which
Armstrong'piled up 110 ; Tarrant, 79 ; McAlister (who was
due for some luck), 69 ; McKenzie 51, and Horan 35.
That didn’t leave many for the other men ; that reliable
old player Sundries was next best with 16. Then N.S.W.
made 461, and its tail went up, while Victoria’s dropped
to the horizontal. The amazing feature of the case was
the resurrection of Syd Gregory with a score of 201.
His total (which occupied 4hr. 47min. and included 24
fours) equals that compilation against Stoddart’s English
team, 13 years ago, which made the Australian famous
and prompted a public gift of over £lOO in recognition of
a mighty effort. Another noteworthy happening w'as
the putting on by the Noble-Gregory partnership
(which lasted 4hrs. I7min.) of 315 of the 461 runs
the side’s innings yielded. Gregory occupied 2hr.
34min. in reaching the century, and notched runs so fast,
comparatively, that he caught Noble at 162, and a
little later led him, but Noble came again, and
stayed in front until Vernon bowled him for 176,
built up in shr. 37min., and embracing 16 fours.
Then there was a heavy and an unaccountable slump,
and after Noble and Gregory making 377 between them
the others (including Sundries) only scored 84 in all. Vic-
toria, with its tail horizontal, went in for its
second innings, and presently was three for 217. Hans-
ford smote the ball like a Crusader hitting a Saracen,
and Victoria’s tail went perpendicular again. But Rans-
ford was caught by Carter for 129, and though the valu-
able Tarrant was 78 not out there was a pretty bad rot
among the other players. With six men (including
McAlister, McKenzie, Hansford and Armstrong) gone for
272, the day closed with Victoria’s tail at a rather dubious
angle.

Saturday saw nothing especially startling in
Victorian pennant cricket, except Delves’ 127 for Carlton
against Collingwood. Partner G. Collins ably assisting,
close on 200 hurried into eminence upon the board,
without the loss of a stick. Both exposed the weakness
of the’Wood attack with considerable contempt for the
leather, and, in all, it was a bashing performance, very
joyful and good to look at. When Delves retired
(caught) Collins had notched 69, which he increased to 72
before being bowled. Smith’s contribution of 78 was
a big gift to South against East, especially as Laver had
been insidious from the start, and had bagged Moir,
Neane, and Kenny, each one for an eyeglass. Other
scores were mostly mediocre to disreputable. Upton’s
66 for University, Bailey’s 48 for Northcote, Kirwan’s 47
for St. Kilda, were the most prominent in a wilderness of
ducks and units. Yet, excepting Laver’s six wickets for
87 on behalf of East, and M’Vitty’s four for 43 for Essen-
don, nobody was singularly influential with the ball.
North Melbourne and P’ran furnished an eleven to down
Kadavu Levu and his dark Fijian acquaintances.
The vitality of the cricketer. Veteran Harry
Trott, playing for Fitzroy in opposition to Melbourne
’Varsity, on Monday, hit up 111 in a manner never
excelled in his salad days, and scattered four wickets
for 89.
* * * *
Tas.-England match at Hobart ended on Mon-
day in virtual victory for the visitors, whose one-innings
t0ta1(455) stood against Tasmania’s 113, and eight for 317.
For Tasmania, Kenny Burn made an attractive display.
From 23 overnight he went to 97 without giving an open-
ing, and had reached 112 before he succumbed to a catch
bv Rhodes off his (Rhodes’) own bowling. Understood
that Burns will be a cricketer no more after this season.
Eady’s contribution of 66 was lucky, mostly. He gave
four chances. Rain compelled cessation before time.

Fiji donned its warpaint and cocoanut matting
on Saturday at the M.C.C. Ground, in order to show
Victoria that its game of cricket wasn’t a circus. Some
9000 people including the tremendous M. 0.0. “dead-
head,” came to observe the supposedly hilarious
proceedings. Most anticipated a gay afternoon, with
war cries, devil dances and things punctuating
the performance ; but, apart from the initial chant
of war, victory, death, or whatever it was, business
was serious. The “boys,” except the two chocolate
royalties, turned out in a complete costume made up of a
plantation and the altogether. They affected dried vege-
table armlets and leglets ; stuck bird’s plumage and wild
fruit or something into their mops, and generally re-
sembled “ Hop’s ” idealistic cannibals on a missionary-
drive. Mr. Kadavu won the toss, and sent the Victorians
in to bat for the apparent reason that he wanted to allow
the boys to play slides on the rich, green sward in
saving boundary hits. Victoria did well by knocking
up 372 for nine wickets, of which H. Bowden
contributed 102, Healey 66, and Henty 59 not out ;
still the chocolate combination made a serious impression
in both fielding and bowling departments, Meleti taking
two catches fine enough for a Test match ; while Liceni
(trundler) bagged six wickets for 60, actually securing
three in one over. Kadavu did fine work at point; while
Joni Sigila, though obtaining two wickets only for 97,
kept batsmen thinking very often. And nothing is equal
to the stupendous composure of Joni bonding.

“ Peter Pan ” ; South Australia has apparently
discovered the bowler it has sighed for since the days of
Giffen and Jones. W. Stirling, aged 16, a medium-pace,
left-arm trundler, has been unearthed by one of the
district clubs, and on his second appearance captured
four wdckets for 42 runs. His victims (three bowled out-
right) were Jennings, Pellew, J. S. Rees, and N. Claxton,
all inter-State players. Stirling’s delivery is similar to
the ball J. V. Saunders sends down, with possibly a little
more trickiness, and he promises to be as good as, if not
better than, the Victorian.

“ Peter Pan ” : As if to prove that his omission
from the Australian Eleven was an oversight, J. Darling
practically won his club’s match against West Torrens,
one of the Adelaide senior teams. The ex-Australian
captain made 83 out of a total of 150, and followed it ufi
with a bowling analysis of three for 23. He was robbed
of a couple more wickets by criminal neglect in the field.
Two easy chances were missed off him. It is being
mildly wondered if he intends to push his claims for in-
clusion in the next Test team.
* * * *
Adelaide behaved like a perfect gentleman
towards Braund during the third Test match. When he
walked to the wickets, not a single audible reference to
the Wallace case was made ; and when Macartney bowled
him first ball, he was not even advised to go and play
footie.

Pace meetings have been held for the benefit of
hospitals, and even churches, and have given them sub-
stantial lifts ; but it remained for Westralia to discover a
new beggar for the wide margin of profit in the racecourse
“gate.” “ I desire to raise funds to send a young and
promising singer to Berlin to study,” wrote a lady to the
committee of the Westralian Turf Club in explanation of
a desire to be allowed to run a picnic race meeting in Cool-
gardie ; but even a strongly sympathetic body of sports
couldn’t see its way clear to give the necessary permission.
Turfdom generally is in something of a flutter
regarding an Oakleigh Plate, Newmarket, and Doncaster
entrant—the imported Traquair, a 4-.vear-old by Ayrshire
from Chelandry, who, at two years, was on England’s top
plane, and gathered, among other plums, Sandown Park
National Breeders’ Produce Stake of £4357. He is also cred-
ited with (while carrying Sst. 121 b.) throwing 6fur. behind
in the staggering time of Imin. llsec. Traquair’s presence
in this section is due to pronounced “ roaring ” which
had him completely broken up less than a year ago. The
possibility that climatic conditions will remedy the
trouble prompts the view that Australia may
shortly, and for the first time, see what an English nag
with a big reputation can do here. All being well
Traquair’s Sst. 131 b. in Oakleigh Plate shouldn’t prevent
him making a one-horse thing of the event.

Result of A.-T.C. Challenge Stakes, Saturday,
provided heaps of food for reflection, and they gathered
up of the fragments ten baskets full. Winner (Lord
Merv) figured in Tatt.’s Club’s Carrington Stakes, Dec. 28
last, and was backed by someone, but evidently every-
thing was not all right—the betting didn’t have a genuine
ring about it—and Lord Merv was prominent only at the
turn for home. Directly ante-post business opened on
Challenge Stakes, Lord Merv was the one most asked for,
and he shortened to threes,’ and remained at that till
operations began on the course. Then the price
receded to fives and, later, to tens and twelves.
A day or two previous to the race it had been
published that Lord Merv was so nervously-consti-
tuted that the sight of a racecourse broke him up,
and he consequently would not be brought there till
the moment for saddling arrived. For hours before the
race interested people busied themselves spreading the
tale referred to, and adding more, with the result that
the odds lengthened as stated. Then, while the bulk of
the crowd and several Patrick Moseses were about the
grand-stand watching the start, two or three com-
missioners became very busy, and quietly gathered
all the twelves, tens, eights and sevens procurable about
the nervously-strung animal whose stable connections
vowed they had little or rm confidence in him. Lord
Merv'landed a big amount nred on the course, as well
as a large sum accumulated i.eforehand. Melodeon, from
the same quarter, who appropriated A.J.C. Handicap on
Boxing Day, was engineered .somewhat similarly, as were
Pendant and others in the past, and though Christian
Moses and punters generally remembered previous ex-
periences, they fell into the latest trap as innocently as if
they were young men from the country hearing for the
first time about an uncle in Fiji.

Though in and out running is common these
times, Sydney hasn’t, for many a day, seen anything to
equal the remarkable improvement shown by Bungledoo
within eight days, leaving his previous contradictions out
of the question. In Rosehill January Stakes, on Saturday
week, Bungledoo (carrying 7st. 131 b.) finished a bad fifth,
but on Saturday last, with Bst. up in A.J.C. Welter Han-
dicap at Randwick, and backed from eights and tens
down to fours, he bolted in front of such good
company as crack Queensland sprinter Forge, Ennismar,
Felicia and Noela, and fairly flew away from them in the
straight, throwing the 7fur. behind in lmin. 27sec.—Jsec.
outside the previous Australian record, shared by Ibex and
Step Out. A great mass of man gathered in front of the
official stand and demonstrated for several minutes before
going home to brood over the utter unreliability of most
horses. The A.J.C. committee was to have investigated
on Monday, but the event was postponed. Bungledoo
is in a stable that has sprung many surprises on New
South Wales.

Pantheon, winner of A.J.C. First Nursery Han-
dicap on Saturday last, provided little short of a
“ skinner ” for Christian Mdses ; this, despite that'on pre-
vious Thursday morning he easily beat Pelsart in a half-
mile spin, and apparently would have won had the dis-
tance been a furlong further. The value of the trial as a
line was in the fact that two weeks before Pelsarcwon a
good race at Canterbury Park. Pantheon is a fine-looking,
well-grown Brakpan colt, that, when closely looked over,
impresses more than favorably.

Lord Fitzroy’s success in A.J.C. Anniversary
Handicap on Saturday (confidently anticipated through
his displays at A.J.C. and Tatt.’s Club Summer meetings)
increased largely thp spoil gathered by the Lord Merv
people. They raked in all the double money available,
and so greedily that ridiculously short odds were in some
instances accepted. Though the added money was
£5OO, only ten, with nothing very good among them,
saddled up. Better than twos on the favorite were unob-
tainable, and so near each other were the stable chums
Absentee and Artful that former started at 4 to I and latter
9to 2 against. Best backed of the others was Royal Arthur,
who set a scorching pace from the jump till well into the
straight. There Lord Fitzroy asserted himself and found
that Absentee needed a lot of shaking off, and they
finished as named with a length between them. Lamora,
very much at the wrong end of the field when half-a-mile
from home, put up a startling finish that landed him
third. Lord Fitzroy is by Grafton (imp.) from Disgrace,
and full brother to Graceton, Nothos, Kaffirpan and Duke
of Grafton. Previous good wins to Lord Fitzroy’s credit
were A.J.C. Champagne Stakes, Rosehill Handicap, A.J.C.
Plate and Waverley Handicap.

Orcus, full brother to faihous Poseidon, and a
luxury that cost his present owner 3050g5., was voted
certain for A.J.C. Second Nursery Handicap, and backed
accordingly, starting at 6t04 in a good field. But frac-
tiousness at the post took considerable out of him
—he wouldn’t face the barrier for some time. Still
the excessively high-priced youngster got off well,
to show prominently for a furlong only. Out-
siders Vervain and Barley Brew battled in front
till the 20 to 1 chance Malteur (owned by theatri-
cal-man J. C. Williamson) swooped down and won
by a length. The contrast! Malteur, by Malster
from Amera (sister to Dandy and Vanitas) by Martini
Henri, was bought at the yearling sales for 260 guineas.
Patrick Moses had an acceptable turn up—few of him
laid a penny against the nag, and the others only did so
to small amounts. The trainer’s investment was a fiver.
Up to Malteur’s drop from the clouds four good favorites
had scored.

Died a day or two ago, of paralysis, at his home,
Randwick;, the well-known Sydney horse-trainer, Jim
Monaghan. Though 70 years old, Monaghan was in
harness at the moment of his seizure, two or three tveeks
ago. As a jockey the dead trainer rode in the first
V.R.C. Champion Stakes, and he had mounts in the Mel-
bourne Cups of ’6l and ’62. As a trainer he handled some
of the best horses Australia has known —notably Marvel,
Sardonyx, Le Grand, Paris, Yarran, Wilga, Kingfish,
Rapid Bay and Penance. Things had gone against
Monaghan latterly, and a fund was being raised for
his benefit just before his death.
After five years’ buffeting about, the Marshall
Plate shows a slight tendency to settle down for life.
Commodore Tom Marshall stipulated that his trophy
should be raced for once per annum, and it was to be won
outright by the owner,who carried it off four times in his
own yacht. This ensured that a fine struggle should rage
among the boats of the Prince Alfred Yacht Club for per-
manent possession. Mr. Brockhoff’s win last week was
his second leg in, he having previously won in the Fleet-
wing in 1904, In 1905 Mr. Muston got temporary pos-
session of the gaud with the Janet, but lost it in 1906 to
Mr. A. W. Beach in the Cooya, from whom it was wrested
in 1907 by Mr. A. E. Cutler in the Kukuburra. On
Saturday last Kukuburra was unable to keep possession
against the Rawhiti, and Mr. Brockhoff is now half way
towards permanent ownership. At the start of the race
the wind died suddenly down, and some of the boats
began to drift. Then Rawhiti’s tall mast poked into an
eddy of wind in the upper air. White Wings caught
a wave of it, and the race had begun in earnest. Yacht
after yacht began to move through the water, and Kuku-
burra suddenly became a thing of speed, and shot forward
with little jerks. But the huge towering Rawhiti, raking
sea and sky for wind, began to overhaul the long markers.
Then into Manly Cove they crept, Rawhiti gaining all the
time, although the breeze was dying right out. So far,
the Magic had led the fleet, but at Shark Island the
Rawhiti went to the front, and stayed there,
with Magic, Culwulla and White Wings behind in
that order. The race was practically over as far as the
Plate was concerned, and the real struggle was between
Magic and Culwulla for sefcond place. Magic got it by
40sec. This is the first race Mr. Brockhoff has won with
his big yacht this season.

The continuation of the inter-State boating car-
nival, on Wednesday, at Sydney, saw Westralians beaten
again, and Svdney crack, Australian, win a great race from
locally-owned Eileen and Crescent, as named, by 30seo.
Visiting craft bad what they prayed for—a good breeze,
yet Aiolus was last over the finishing line, and Robin
withdrew, evidently in trouble, when there was no hope
of being placed better than sixth. Only veteran Chris.
Webb’s hard battling over every inch landed Australian
in front. Fifteen out of 16 entrants started. Saturday
saw the inter-State class (18-footers) championship for
Perth (W.A.) Flying Squadron’s Challenge Cup decided.
Australian led throughout, and finished lnnn. 35sec.
ahead of Aldus, thus retrieving the laurels won from it
in Westralian waters last year. TEolus’s position, after
its poor displays of previous Wednesday and Saturday,
surprised spectators, and proved that, well-handled, there
is little difference between the boats ; victory would
probably rest with that sailed in its own waters. Webb,
again at the Australian’s helm, never made anything ap-
proaching a mistake.
* * * *
The insincerity of Bent’s legislation against
gambling shops in Melbourne —a legislation forced upon
him by the loud cry of Scandal, as echoed by the small
persistent voice of Judkins and co.—is sho vn in the fact
that he is passively assisting the efforts of Private Enter-
prise in racecourse management. The course for horses
or ponies is the one officially-licensed gambling place in
Victoria. If Bent were sincerely bent on making the best
of an unavoidable job (for the licensing of a denounced
“ Evil ” must necessarily be a job), he would kill Private
Enterprise in the matter by legalising the Totalisator and
confining its use to racing clubs, conducted by honorary
stewards on behalf of the one sport which provides an
admitted outlet for the betting spirit of the public. But
in the first place he denies the Totalisator to racing
clubs, and now he pretends to think that Private
Enterprise is entitled to be placed on level terms
with the racing clubs, which have hitherto had
a legislative power over horseowners and book-
makers. In short, Bent is prepared to abolish the dis-
tinction between the racing corporation that is precluded
from seeking personal enrichment of its members and the
Private Enterprise which runs a racecourse as a business.
Already he has declared himself a protector of book-
makers by using his influence to prevent the legalisation
of the Tote on racecourses. And now he, the unwilling
suppressor of notorious Private Enterprise gambling hells,
professes to no reason why a monopoly of racecourse
ownership should not be achieved by John Wren, if John
can knock out a! 1 competitors. And if all racecourses
were conducted by Wren, the Bent Government would
presumably make haste to legalise the Totalisator for the
profit of that individual gambler. *
The third round of Sydney pennant bowling
was done with Saturday, and already all winners in recent
years are out of it. Concluding stages will be contested
by Strathfield, Gladstone Park, Randwick, and Balmain ;
and Randwick and Strathfield look like reaching the
final.
* * * *
A number of peaceful gentlemen have come
over from Maoriland to play bowls, and as it is the
prevailing fashion for teams from the Land of the Moa to
have a war-cry, the peaceful gentlemen, before they make
a start, shout the Maori equivalent for the following
Aucklanders, behold the enemy.
Lo ! we behold them. Lo ! we behold them.
Aucklanders, ho, spring forward to the contest.
Herewith we advance against them.
Proceed with the battle, proceed,
That renown may properly rest upon
Whichever side shows the greater prowess.
Yet it is difficult to imagine a seasoned bowler springing
forward to anything. It is difficult to imagine him
springing in any direction for any earthly consideration.
Springing would be against all the traditions of the game.
But the Maorilanders have got the war-cry habit so badly
that before one of them sits down to play crib in a
strange land he must go out and blow off an arrangement
of sounds from his mouth, and make as much row as if he
were going to shed his blood for his country.
The Maoriland bowlers, representing the Auck-
land District Association, reached Sydney just inside two
weeks ago, and were to have moved homeward yesterday.
They began well, beating the strong City and Petersham
Club teams in successive matches, and snatching the only
M.L.-N.S.W. event out of the fire by one point through
sheer grit and tenacity of purpose. But by that time the
picnic part of the business had commenced to get its
work in. Junketing from early morning till well into the
night left the Maorilanders fairly easy game, with the
result that they subsequently went under, at Waverley,
to the same Sydney team which suffered a disastrous bowl-
ing experience but had a high old time otherwise in M.L.
last year. Next day the visitors found Parramatta’s
players their masters; and on Saturday last, at New-
castle, they bumped an additional reverse. The bowler
who is as good a player away as at home is a rare bird
indeed ; there’s too much joy in his trips.

The N.S.W. Rugby League is still moving, and
last week it hatched another club at Paddington. No
less distinguished a personage than Colonel Onslow was
elected patron, but the fact that a local butcher was
unanimously chosen president suggests that the new
body is out for gore.
* ♦ * *
During the heat wave in Melbourne a frequent
cause of spills was the bursting of bicycle tyres owing to
the expansion of the air contained therein.
* * * *
The English Dunlop Tyre Co. last year pushed
its profits up from £179,334 to £200,478. In Australia
the same tyre is still easily top dog in the market, no less
than 300,000 having been made here last year, and all sold
in Australasia.
* * * *
Edison still babbles that his 20-year storage
battery is completed, but, so far, there is no sign of the
thing on the market or otherwise, and there is a growing
suspicion and dread that America’s splendid adaptor and
improver of ideas—the Shakspeare of mechanics—has got
hallucinations and dreams.
* * * *
“.T.A.” writes: —The League of Victorian
Wheelmen, the alleged controlling body of cycle racing
in the Cabbage State, is a most unrepresentative sports
government, for the reason that it is composed entirely
of sports promoters—A.N.A., Ancient Druids, Victorian
Railways Mutual Benefit Society, Eight Hours Society,
Melbourne Bicycle Club (which isn’t a bicycle club), and
various minor bodies, who are represented by a delegate,
or delegates, according to the amount of boodle put up.
It is therefore evident that the game is in the hands of
people who regard it as a show, and who, generally speak-
ing, have no athletic interest in cycling, and never cross a
machine. The original L.V.W., founded November 3rd,
1893, by Messrs. Garnet, Gallan, Muirhead, Schwaebsch
and Scott, was an entirely different concern and had for
its objects—To promote the interests and regulate the
affairs of cycling ; to protect the rights of wheelmen ; to
encourage and facilitate touring; to arrange annual
championships ; to authenticate and register records ; to
acquire grounds ; to deal with Parliamentary proposals
affecting cycling. Any person could become a member on
payment of ss. Clubs with not less than lo members
were represented by one delegate, and paid a sub. of £1
Is., with a capitation fee of 2s. 6d. per member. Country
clubs were admitted for 10s. 6d. A general election was
. held, enabling the racing man or otherwise to have a say
jin the government. “ Bob ” Best, M.L.A. (now M.H.R.),
was president, while such men as Prof. Kernot took an
interest in things. The unsuspecting tourist was warned
of steep grades by danger-boards, and the distance to the
nearest pub was also put up. Under this control, biking
boomed in Victoria. In Oct., 1900, a reorganisation
took place, whereby the L.V.W. controlled racing,
and another body was formed—National Touring
Association—to deal with touring. B. Garnet took on
the secretaryship of the Association, while Theo Heide
handled League matters. The funds and property were
to be divided, but the League hangs on to more than its
share till this day. Some little time later the Melbourne
Bicycle Club tried to grab the racing end of the stick, but
failed. June 20th, 1901, the League reconstructed, and
promoters, minor promoters, and cycle clubs which pro-
vided big stakes were alone admitted, so the concern
drifted into its present unrepresentative state with a sec.
drawing £3OO per annum. Under the present regime Geo.
Broadbent, the handicapper till recently, was reduced in
salary owing to an expected decrease in revenue. But for
the same period that “ Broady” was “ docked,”Secretary
“ Batty ” Gleeson got a substantial increase; Promoter
McLachlan, of Sale, turned up the League becadpe.it bled
him to the tune of eighty pounds for a carnival; Under
the aforesaid control Bill Martin won his memorable
Austral of ’Ol, the odor whereof still hovers around. The
cyclist, generally speaking, is sweated to make a Fatman
holiday. The League that presided over Bill Martin’s
Austral cannot be called sound.
N.S.W.’s reps. (Cecil Healy, J. R. Garland and
Pvrmont’B boy top-notcher, O. Dickman) left for Westralia,
on Saturday last, to compete in the Australasian cham-
pionships, at Perth, next month. Healy should win the
“ hundred,” 220vds. and 400yds., and Garland will pro-
bably gather the distance events—if Queenslander Spring-
field doesn’t.
$ ♦ ♦ *
The first of dead Barney Kieran’s world’s
swimming figures to go was the 200yds., which Cecil
Healy, at Lavender Bay Baths, Sydney, last week, re-
duced from 2min. 16sec. (accomplished at Kentish Town
Baths, London, in July, 1905) to 2min. 11 l-ssec. Kieran’s
200yds. was the easiest of all his great performances to
beat; he never could sprint as speedily as some of his
contemporary top-notchers, and, as 200yds. is rarely
swum, very few cracks have had opportunities to display
their powers over the distance. Healy has set a very
stiff task for the next man.
* * * *
Le Matin is not likely to see its.round-the-
top-half-of-the-world motor race next year, and the
well-knowm motorist Glidden suggests that it should be
made a combination of motor and balloon race. The
track, as outlined by the French paper, would run from
New York to Chicago, then through the Canadian Nor’-
West to Alaska and across the ice-clad mountains down
to the Polar waters of Behring’s Strait. Even if that was
safely crossed, the Stanavol Range, over which never a
white man has forced his way, rises like a forest-clad
wall, with the awful Karaulakshish as a line of second
obstruction, and impassable bogs and forests lie between.
The motor-boat proposal is absurd, and the balloon idea
looks premature. The Bulletin wagers a modest half-
dollar the trip will not eventuate! for many a year yet.
* * * *
Maoriland club-swinger and boxer Jim Pettin-
gell—prominent 17 or 13 years ago—is in Sydney, blind
through an accident, and dependent upon charity. The
writer hasn’t seen anyone—not even world’s endurance
champion Tom Burrows—whirl the clubs better than
Pettingell did in his prime, and he was a good fighter
when good .fighters were the rule in Australia, and not
fche exception as now.

The heat wave in Melbourne disclosed the
fact that one nurse at Brunswick had in her charge
12 children, of whom five succumbed to the heat.
Now, what woman can effectively mother 12infants?
Victoria’s infantile death-rate is the highest in
Australasia, barring that of Westralia, and the
story of this woman at Brunswick seems to suggest
a reason, or part of a reason.

STARTLING DISCOVERY of the CAUSE of
APPENDICITIS!
According to an authoritative report it is stated that Dr. Blanchard
has placed before the world his startling discovery as to the cause of
Appendicitis. It is asserted, moreover, that his opinion is endorsed by
Professor Metchnikoff, the celebrated scientist of the Pasteur Institute.
These eminent research workers, the report states, have discovered certain
parasites in the appendix of every case which they have examined. It is
further stated that there are three kinds of these parasites or intestinal
worms, the most dangerous of which is known as the trygocephal, and it is
this which causes the acute pain. Appendicitis is neither contagious nor
infectious, but it frequently becomes epidemic in character, more particu-
larly in hot weather. According to Professor Blanchard, the common vege-
tables of everyday use may contain parasites which set up Appendicitis.
Fortunately, however, there is a certain preventive of this dire scourge,
Appendicitis, which, if regularly adopted, will render us immune against its
attacks. This remedy is Kutnow’s Powder, which, when taken before
breakfast in a glass of water, quickly removes all parasites, foreign bodies,
and poisonous matter. It cleanses the entire system and gives renewed
activity to the digestive organs so that any waste matter instead of remain-
ing in the body and forming an irritant poison is regularly removed each day.
DR. H. E. WHITFORD writes:—
“ Chicago, Illinois, May 2.
“ Dear Sirs, —I find .Kutnow’s Powder particularly valuable in children s
cases, and also those cases of recurrent attacks of appendicitis, accomplishing the
two things necessary—balance of stomach and free evacuation of ailmentary canal.
I am, dear Sirs, yours faithfully, ' “H. E. WHITFORD, M.D.”
DR. J. BOND SULLIVAN writes:—
“ Knock, Ennis, Co. Clare, Ireland.
“ Having recently got from you a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder, from which I
personally derived much benefit, will you now kindly send me a larger supply ? I
really feel unsatisfied without it myself, and I have recommended it to several lady
patients, who approve of it greatly. An aged clergyman to whom I recommended
Kutnow’s Powder tells me he finds it both effective and agreeable.
“J. BOND SULLIVAN, M.D., M.R.C.S. (Eng.), &c.”
REV. F. L. BULLEN writes:—
Wellesley, Church Lane, Highfield, Southampton, Oct. 22.
“ Dear Sirs, —I have no objection to your publishing my testimony concerning
the excellent properties of Kutnow’s Powder. I only wish I had tried it years ago.
In my case it has proved to be an agreeable and gentle aperient, cleansing the liver
and kidneys, relieving the brain of any symptoms of pain or discomfort, and
regulating generally the whole organic system. “ (Rev.) F. L. BULLEN.”
SiR JOHN B. MONCKTON
(late Town Clerk of London)
wrote :
“Guildhall, London, E.C.
“Gentlemen, —I have much satisfaction in stating
that for the last two years I have regularly used
Kutnow’s Powder, with the result that troublesome
and frequent attacks of lumbago, with other gouty
symptoms that had troubled me for years, seem to
have entirely disappeared. —I am, dear Sirs, yours
faithfully, “JOHN B. MONCKTON.”
HOW TO DETECT
FRAUDULENT IMITATIONS
Be careful to avoid spurious substitutes, which
are sometimes sold : for a few' pence less. The
purchaser, through a misdirected spirit of
economy, little thinks that he is the means of a
direct incentive to fraud. The genuine and
original Kutnow’s Powder is alone strongly re-
commended by all; leading physicians for the
stomach, liver, kidrieys, and bowels. Insist on
getting Kutnow’s, which you earn obtain at all
conscientious chemists throughout the world.

CUTICURA EFFECTED
A MARVELOUS CURE
“it is with much pleasure that I
write to inform you of the successful
result of the use of Cuticura Soap and
Cuticura Ointment, which I used for &
running eczema on my child’s head,
being the after result of ringworms. I
have had lotions from the doctors, also
from different chemists, but they did
not have any effect on it. But after
constantly washing the child’s head
with Cuticura Soap for about three
weeks and using about half a box of
Cuticura Ointment, I am pleased to
eay that my child’s head is now per-
fectly clean and free from any sores,
which I must say seems a marvelous
cure after three years’ suffering. I
6hall be pleased to recommend the
Cuticura Remedies to any one. Mrs.

Frank E. Allan added his indignant say to the
Melbourne Aon discussion re the cricket of to-day and
long ago. Other people have said the same thing, but
Allan is worth quoting in spots:—“lnstead of bright
play, what do we now get? Contests in which the wast-
ing of time appears to be reduced to a fine art. The
umpires come out about 12. The field team follows some
little time after, and indulges in playful trick-catching
until the batsmen appear. Then the placing of the field
begins. It does not appear necessary to do this before
the batsmen arrive, although the captain must know who
will start the bowling. When the striker is ready the
bowler must have a few of those ridiculous trial
balls, although he had probably had some a short
time previously at the preliminary practice. He
could, in any case, have had a few while waiting
for the batsmen. Then the sight-board has, of
course, to be looked to. Probably four balls of
the first over (if not the lot) are just outside the off
stump, and the crowd looks on with bated breath while
the wicketkeeper and the bowler play ball together.
The batsmen refuse to run easy singles, or to make the
first, run fast where there is a possible two. If these easy
singles were attempted, the fieldsmen would have to be
brought in to save them, with the result that the hard
hits would get through for threes and fours.” It is only
by the steady drip, drip of reasonably satirical comment
that an infatuated public can be provoked into kicking
against the tactics that make Test cricket a narcotic for
the onlooker. The time-wasting policy is—as Frank
Allan shows—practically declared at the outset of the
game. The captain of the Outs knows who is going to
open the bowling, and who will take first strike ;
yet the placing of the field and the trial-balls
performance is delayed until the batsmen arrive.
As for this latter absurdity, it should be abolished
by an M.O.C. ru!_ without further ado. Why, in the
sacred name of Lilywhite, were “ trial ” balls ever per-
mitted ? There can be no rule compelling batsmen to
“ steal ” the easy singles that Frank Allan speaks of, but
seeing that the system of run “ stealing ” enlivens the
game, and is effective in a large as well as a small way,
the selectors of Test teams should count run-stealing as a
special virtue in a competent player. Which suggests
the necessity for taking the easy job of team selection
out of the hands of men who are themselves personally
concerned in making cricket slow and dull.
* * * tr
“ Araeipo” : Me slow cricket and the various
suggestion for making batsmen score instead of simply
keeping up their wickets in the hope of tiring the
bowlers. It is, of course, impossible to make any rule
that a batsman must make a certain number of runs in an
hour—a man might not be able to get the strike, and the
bowlers might waste time. But why not make a rule that
every partnership must produce runs at the rate of, say,
50 per dozen overs, the penalty for failure to be the for-
feiture of the slower batsman’s wicket? Twelve overs
take about half-an-hour to bowl, so, allowing for delays
at fall of wickets, lunch, afternoon-tea and many drinks,
runs would have to come at the rate of, at least, 400 per
day. There could then be no dull periods of play, and
there would be some decidedly lively play towards the
end of the 12 overs. Of course the wicket would have to
be slightly narrower in order to make the bowlers keep
the bowling within reach of the batsmen.
* * * *
“ F.C.” : Detective O’Donnell, who is supposed
to look after the morals of Melbourne in the matter of
gambling, says Bent’s new Gaming Act has practically
abolished street betting, Chinese lotteries, two-up-
schools and fan-tan. It is a pretty large claim, but a fair
one if you keep your eye glued on the word “ practically.”
Don’t lose sight of “practically.” The Chow lotteries, I
believe, have stopped. If any are being run they are
managed so quietly and so restrictedly as to be
negligable. As for “two-up,” however, you can bump
against a school in almost any suburb any pleasant Sun-
day afternoon ; that is, if you are not a “ D.” The
aggregate Ah Fat doesn’t gamble perhaps as much as he
used to, but the leopard doesn’t change his spots all at
once. A few years back Lilly Buck-stleet used to be
almost empty on Sunday evenings. When John wasn’t
cabinet-making he was playing fan-tan ; even the
yellow heathen who assimilated Christianity in the
Mission room used afterwards to slip into the little shop
adjacent and gamble over the bones. Now the street is
almost impassable with Ah Fats squatted about taking
the smell, or listening to an alarming outburst of heathen
music issuing from the Chow restaurant; but through
sundry upstairs and occasional downstairs windows, espe-
cially in the by-lanes, one may still hear the rattle of the
bones. Still, taking it all round, the Gaming Act has
proved fairly effective, which result is chiefly due to the
provision for quarantining suspected premises. The
landlord doesn’t worry, as a rule, what sort of business
is carried on in his houses or shops so long as he gets his
rent regularly, and the shadier the business the bigger
the rent; but when the Law steps in with a quarantine
order, the rent stops with a jerk. That policy of quaran-
tining premises might be applied to many things besides
gambling.

If that “ Round-the-World ” motor race sug-
gested by Le Matin (Paris) comes off, The Bulletin tips
that the cars will get stranded on the Asian side of
Behring Straits—supposing they get across the Straits.
On the Yankee side there are some ghost-like tracks—
places where efforts have been made to clear a way ; but
on the Asian side the land, to within a few miles of the
shore, is covered with vast, dense forests through which
even the indomitable Russian has not yet attempted to
make roads, and unless the cars can swim round the
coast till they get within cooee of Russian settlement, it
is not clear how they are going to get through. To cross
Behring Straits on the ice the journey must be made in
winter, and winter in that awful far north forestland is
just plain iceberg trimmed with bears and curses.

“Two Seas ” : The opponents of pigeon-murder-
ing are not all “ sickly sentimentalists,” as the followers
of the game aver. Was talking to a man whose every
spare hour is spent with his dogs and gun. His con-
versation is mostly of fur and feather, and his eyes gleam
when extolling the cleverness of his favorite” pointer.
Yet, when I happened to remark that I was surprised at
not seeing his name mentioned in connection with the
local pigeon matches, he turned upon me with an indig-
nant, “ What the do you take me for? Do you want
to insult me ? I’m telling you that I’m fond of Sport, and
you turn round and ask me why I don’t join a lot of
whisky-swilling Cockneys in blazing away at tame doves
in a blanky cage. Sport, I said, you ! ! Don’t you
know what Sport is ? ” He seemed quite annoyed.
Ihe principals of the Burke and Wills
exploration journey differed from the rest of their
party in their prompt manner of dying. Under-
lings and hangers-on have been lingering about
Australia ever since, and of the expedition of 1860
there is yet alive at least one—Consul William
Brahe, of Melbourne. James Robert Lane,
whose death was reported lately, at the age of
85, was a member of that party when it set out,
and did some rough country wandering on his
own account.

&/>e LONE HAND
THE AUSTRALIAN MONTHLY.
Welcomed by Four Continents!
Read what the world is saying of “The Lone Hand”:
AUSTRALASIA.
The steady improvement which has been perhaps the
most gratifying feature about The Lone Hand magazine
since it made its appearance in Australia, eight months
ago, is fully maintained in the January number, which
is just published.— Sydney Morning Herald.
The magazine has the qualities—the braininess, the
audacity, the freshness, the humor, the reliance upon
the artists’ aid—which have achieved for The Bulletin a
popularity so remarkable and sustained.—Sydney Daily
Telegraph.
The new magazine approximates to perfection. ... It
is a sublimated Bulletin. The satire, irony, and cynicism
are all perpetuated in The Lone Hand, but purged into
literature . . . marking a new epoch in Australian litera-
ture.— Daily Mail (Brisbane).
This illustrated monthly makes rapid strides towards
perfection.— Hobart Mercury (Tas.).
It now takes rank easily among the high-class month-
lies of the world. ... It is a triumph of taste and effect-
iveness.—Perth Evening Mail (W.A.).
Enterprise, energy, and ability are all manifest in its
pages.—Adelaide Advertiser.
The new magazine is as clever as The Bulletin ... a
most excellent magazine.—Sydney Stock and Station
Journal.
The very best that Australia has turned out in litera-
ture and in art to date.—Bathurst National Advocate.
A credit to any country. —Richmond River Express
(N.S.W.).
Alike in its pictorial department and its letterpress it
represents the work of well-known Australians, who form
quite a galaxy of talent; and the business direction of
the enterprise is evidently gifted with originality, and
what the Americans call “braininess.”— Register (Ade-
laide).
The Lone Hand keeps up the high character of the
monthly, both pictorially and for its literary matter.—
Australasian (Melb.).
Quite equal to the very best of contemporaneous maga-
zines of the British-speaking world. —Oowra Free Ex-
press (N.S.W.).
Beautifully written, most interesting. .. . One article
alone is worth the price of the entire number. —Numur-
kah Leader (Vic.)
A complete fulfilment of high expectations which have
everywhere been formed in respect to it. Should be in
every patriotic Australian home. —Temora Independent
(N.S.W.).
In it are grouped the best and brightest intellects of
Australia’s literary world, and we can send it away to
encounter the criticism of all-comers confidently.—
Moree Examiner (N.S.W.).
It is the Australian magazine, brilliant, vigorous,
original, cultured, and clean.—Dalby Herald (Q.).
Australia will have an irresistible champion in The
Lone Hand. —Ballarat Echo (Vic.).
As the most ambitious contribution yet made by Aus-
tralia to magazine literature, The Lone Hand, an
illustrated monthly, will receive a cordial welcome from
all quarters and classes. It is a typical Bulletin produc-
tion. By that we mean it is in the hands of clever and
capable editors, men who know the value of readable
copy, and still more of space. Its literary fare is pro-
vided by front-rank literary chefs. Its artistic work is
associated with the names of a group of Australian artists
famous in every cottage, shanty, station and homestead
where The Bulletin is known.— Watchman (Sydney).
The Lone Hand assumes first place among Australian
magazines, for it possesses qualities distinctly superior to
its compeers. Its high artistic and literary merit is un-
doubted, and its success is assured if the standard now
reached is maintained. It is the best value for the nimble
shilling that is to be had at the bookstalls.—Warwick
Argus (Q.).
The Lone Hand for October has lost none of that bril-
liance which characterised its predecessors. Exquisitely
illustrated, The Lone Hand ranks as a magazine of the
first water, the quality of the literary contents being
quite equal to the best served by the monthlies and
quarterlies of Old England.—Hutt and Petone Chronicle
(Maoriland).
The Lone Hand has the stamp and appearance of
genuine literature all over it. It is full of good things.—
Table Talk (Melb.).
The publication is one of exceptional merit.— Otak
Mail (Maoriland).
Australia’s most popular periodical.—Marlborough
Press (Maoriland).
This superbly printed and artistically illustrated maga-
zine.— Kiahoura Sun (Maoriland).
GREAT BRITAIN.
The Lone Hand is The Bulletin’s recognition of the
need of a new outlet for Australian art and letters. It is
a monthly illustrated magazine devoted to the expression
of all that is brightest and most hopeful in the life and
ideals of Australia. Sunshine, the joy of life, faith in
the future, a vigorous healthy humanism—these are to be
the keynotes of the new venture. —London Morning Post.
Full of fascinating stories and articles. Its pages are
full of wisdom, humor, and tragedy.—Bristol (Eng.)
Western Daily Express.
Its contents are varied, abundant, and thoroughly in-
teresting—short, bright articles about subjects of
moment, and short stories prevailing. It is noteworthy
that the contributors are mainly Australians. —Christian
World (London).
The literary contents of The Lone Hand are bright
and varied. The magazine presents the cheerful side of
life to its readers, and is dominated by a vigorous spirit
of healthy optimism which should go far to ensuring its
success.—Daily Chronicle (London).
The Lone Hand, a new colonial monthly illustrated
magazine, is so full of fascinating stories and articles that
it should easily win a high place in public favor. —
Western Daily Express (Eng.).
The Lone Hand has individuality, and in that it differs
from many of the colorless periodicals we have in this
country.—Liverpool Courier (Eng.).
AMERICA.
The Lone Hand is a fine example of good magazine
making and is full of high-class readable fiction and choice
miscellany.—Detroit Hews (U.S.A.).
One makes a prophecy. Before its first anniversary
shall have been announced The Lone Hand will take its
place as the finest literary production in magazine-form
in the world. —Western Pacific Herald (Honolulu).
The Lone Hand is independent, bright, cheerful, and
natural. May it continue its grip.—S'r. John’s Globe
(America).
The Lone Hand is certainly a publication that can
compare favorably with the best monthlies of the upper
world.—The Quebec Chronicle (Canada).
Ambrose Bierce, one of the greatest of America’s
writers and critics, writes to a friend :
“ I have written a few words of praise of The Lone
Hand for Life (New York). Alas ! All our magazines are
Dead Sea fruit compared to it.”
ASIA.
Decidedly The Lone Hand is a departure from the
regular ruck, and its vital force will carry it to success.
In the stories, the art of compression has almost attained
its limit.—Hongkong Telegraph (China).
The first number places The Lone Hand in the front
rank of the shilling monthlies, and this Australian maga-
zine may be expected to secure an appreciative public
among Britishers everywhere.—Bangkok Times (Siam).
Why, some of the Ceylon papers would go bankrupt in
a year if they dared emulate the same enterprise. There
is plenty of humor as well as pages of human interest in
The Lone Hand, which we should like to see “ enquired
of ” by clubs, libraries, and private subscribers in Ceylon.
—Ceylon Independent.
Perhaps the boldest and most welcome feature of the
issue is the fearless and capable exposures of various
frauds and swindlers, and by thus revealing the hidden
things, and at the same time voluntarily depriving itself
of a big source of income by way of advertisements, the
proprietary has merited public confidence. —South China
Morning Post.
AFRICA.
Coming from the office of the famous journal, The
Bulletin (Sydney), this new venture might be expected to
be bright, straight-hitting, and clever, and it fully justi-
fies the expectation.—Natal Mercury, S’Africa.
The whole tone of its contents is distinctly original.
There is a refreshing youthfulness and vigor throughout.
The prevailing note of the magazine is a breezy, cheery
optimism.—Natal (S’Africa) Advertiser.
It is full of interest.—St. Helena Guardian (Napo-
leon’s Isle).
February Issue —on sale Saturday—represents
the highest point yet reached in interest!

Suppose the Sydney Telegraph’s military
genius, who opposes universal training, carts his
opposition to Japan or Germany—the two
countries we and Britain are most likely to run up
against. When he has converted them, it will be
time enough for Australia to listen, just as it is
time enough to abolish locksmiths when you have
converted burglars.
Some day when the eternal ocean is gray
and wrinkled and its white beard is blowing about
in the gale, it will rise suddenly from its bed, like
a sleeper awakened by an imperative summons,
and come sweeping inland in one vast, quivering,
white-crested mass. Before that dreadful gray-
green wall our frail civilisation will go like dust
before a housemaid’s broom. Houses, men, trains,
ships, trees, policemen and cheap phonographs
will litter the slope of the advancing wave, and, in
the comparative silence—for the mass will do its
horrifying work with merely a far-off. subdued
roar—a despairing voice may cry, “Whaffor?”
Then if the writer happens to be anywhere
handy, he will stand up on his particular fragment
of wreckage and howl back : “We put up colored
advertisements in the face of the sea, and the gods
of the depths are avenging themselves upon us.
The waters came and sported at our doors, and we
threw rubbish into them. The sun rose in glory
to smile on this paradise of the sea, and the first
thing his eye lit on was a yellow sign about a bad
whisky. He glared on the cliffs, and the ancient
sandstone told him to use Flapstocker’s Pills for
Bile. He looked on the waters, and a
lone fishermen put up his sail, and the
sail yelled to him to Drink Bladgad’s Beer.
And this is the result ! ” By that time the waters
will have gathered up all the rubbish, and they
will sweep back over the same course, and, arriving
again at the coast, leap in a roaring cataract back
into their yawning bed. The towering cliffs will
spout and drain for days, and, in about a week’s
time, the sun one morning will look down on a
silent, clean-swept world with a few puzzled
mountaineers prospecting about amongst the
ruins. Then the handful of survivors will put two
and two together—if two hasn’t been blotted out
—and decide to commence afresh on new lines,
and make the erection of hoardings against beauti-
ful scenery a capital offence. And it will be a
darned good job.

FULL PARTICULARS ON APPLICATION TO THE- SOLE AGENTS,
THE CLAVIOLA

parallel—they are electric records, note by note, of the ACTUAL
PLAYING of the World’s Greatest Pianists, and are perfect renditions
of the classics.
Other important features of the Claviola are: —

FROOTOIDS
For Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation, and Biliousness.
OOO
The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
They are elegant in appearance, pleasant
to take, and, what is of the utmost
importance, are thoroughly reliable in
affording quick relief.
Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so far
that they not only act as an aperient,
but do remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident at once by the disappearance of
headache, the head becoming clear, and
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when Con-
gestion of the Brain or Apoplexy is pre-
sent or threatening. They have been
tested, and have been proved to afford
quick relief in such cases when other
aperients have not done any good at all.
It is of the utmost importance that this
should be borne in mind, for in such
cases to take an ordinary aperient is to
waste time and permit of a serious ill-
ness becoming fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
“antibilious pills” make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill by
“antibilious pills” who could have been
cured at once by Frootoids. People
should ; not allow themselves to be duped
into contracting a medicine-taking habit
by being persuaded to take daily doses
with each meal of so-called indigestion
cures that do NOT cure. Frootoids
have been subjected to extensive tests,
and have in every case proved success-
ful in completely curing the complaints
named.
The ordinary adult dose of Frootoids,
of which there are 72 in a bottle, is 2 to
4 —more or less as required—taken, pre-
ferably at bedtime, when constipated,
or at the commencement of any other
disease requiring an aperient, as aD
auxilliary with the special medicine
necessary for the case. A constipated
habit of body will be completely cured
if the patient will on each occasion,
when suffering, take a dose of Frootoids,
instead of an ordinary aperient; making
the interval between the taking of each
dose longer and the dose smaller. The
patient thus gradually becomes indepen-
dent of Aperient Medicines.

“Chuck”
the Drugs
before it is too late! Stop dosing your nerves
and stomach with stimulating poisons which give false
strength or deaden the nerves, thereby affecting only the
symptoms, while the cause of the symptoms
grows worse. Drugs never reach the cause for they do
not create strength. You can stop the pain in a bad
tooth with drugs, but the bad tooth remains and grows worse.
If you are weak or in pain, drugs will temporarily give you
false strength or deaden the pain, but the cause of the
weakness or pain remains with you, and the longer it remains
the worse it grows. The drug-doser eventually must pay
Nature’s price for the false strength he gets, just as the drunkard
must pay days of remorse and misery for the few short hours of
intoxication he enjoys. Therefore, if you are now, dosing your
system with poisonous drugs, stop it before it is too late ! Stop
it and use Nature’s cure —Electricity, which gives to the weak,
worn-out body and nerves the very strength they have lost.
Electricity is nerve food, it is the life of the blood, a healthy
body is full of it, a weak, nerveless body lacks it. Use
it as we apply it with the celebrated
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
and it will cure you._ If you suffer from Nervousness, Weahness, Debility, Varicocele, Rheu-
matism, Sciatica, Weaß Back, Indigestion or Constipation, throw all your pills, powders
and medicines out of the window, and use this rational, natural cure—Electricity—which the foremost scientists of the
present day admit is the only remedy which cures absolutely. There is not an ailing man or woman whom it will not
benefit, and it can do no harm when applied with our Belt. It will not burn sting or shock, although the heating,
vitalizing thrill can be felt all through the body as it pours its life-giving power into the nerves, blood and tissues, building
them up and driving pain, weakness and disease out of the system. Our Belts are sold in every civilized country in
the world. The thousands of testimonials we have received from all parts of Australia, and the many years of success we
have had here, are absolute proof that Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt is the standard. We have many imitators but no
equals. Don’t be misled by false “ Free Belt ” offers, or the extravagant claims of those who promise an impossible
appliance as bait for a 20-guinea course of drugs. Don’t take drugs ; use Electricity alone as we apply it and you will
have nothing to regret. Our prices are witbin the reach of all. All belts are sent by
parcels post, free of duty and carriage throughout Australasia.

We have published an illustrated
book which every man and woman

THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as “run-down” or “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway's Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
<y>
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Pills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pams and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway’s Ointment affords mo*' welcome relief
in a very short time.

An essay on suicide : :
Salvager Booth, in a report which was issued in Lon-
don last Thursday, claims that his Anti-Suicide Bureau
has saved 1500 people from self-destruction. Could
fatuity which is father and mother of Cheek further go?
The type that wanders off to a bureau to discuss his or
her projected self-slaughter no more means business than
does the puny street brawler with the cigarette habit and
no chin, who wrestles with his coat, and clamors to be
allowed to get at and pulverise bis receding insulter.
Fifty-four per cent, of those alleged to have been snatched
from death pleaded “ financial embarrassment.” That
is to say, 810 persons were found with sufficient hide
to come to Booth's bureau and threaten that they would
make with their life’s gore a mess of the public estate—
or else of somebody’s private estate —unless they were
paid not to do it. But, failing settlement, would thev
have shed their blood—or preferably let the bill-sender
shed his instead ?
Nor do the 11 per cent, whom “drink, drugs and
disease ’ afflicted, but whom the Salv’army officials ulti-
mately arguedaway from the tomb, carry conviction. No
argument can make incurable disease the more bearable ;
and the genuine drink and drug fiend regards a bureau as
a place merely from which to get funds for more beer or
more dope.
As to the 135 melancholia patients who became
cheerful and rational after a visit to the Booth institution
—simply a man has melancholia, or he hasn’t. If he has,
and decides on suicide, murder, or any of the other
things which appeal to melancholiacs, nothing barring a
padded cell will stop him ; if he hasn’t, he may live to a
green old age, and take down credulous Salv’anny Homes
to the last. The suicide who finds grace, and decides not
t' o d° it any more, after going to an office and being
called ber-r-ruther, is almost necessarily a sickly fraud
and a sham, like his dreadful and mendacious prototype
who hates work, and consequently makes an easy living
by publicly deploring the past burglaries he was always
too tired to commit.
Booth claims to have stopped far more suicides than
usually happen in London, and fully one-third of those
which usually happen in the whole United King-
dom. And when the year’s figures come out suicides
will almost certainly be just as numerous as they were
before the Clamorous Red Person started to stop them.
William Sinclair, of Guy Fawkes (N.S. W.),
was born on Guy Fawkes Day, married on Guy
Fawkes Day, and settled at Guy Fawkes on Guy
Fawkes Day, 49 years ago. The family roll of
William Sinclair is 24 entries long, and all the
children who attend the Tyringhain public school
belong to this one fruitful house.
“Oby ” : One incident in the late Arch-
bishop Murphy’s career suggests a local possi-
bility. At the time of the Indian Mutiny lie was
Bishop of Hyderabad, and had a seminary there
conducted by priests. The bishop applied to the
Prime Minister for firearms, and, when supplied,
had the priests and students drilled and trained.
It is said that the sight of this drilling helpwl
largely to inspire confidence among the residents
of Hyderabad. What if the clerical seminaries
and colleges of Australia followed the example,
and applied to the Defence authorities for stands
of arms? The holy men may yet be wanted, and
why should a good thing be delayed till the last
hour ?

A Gospel of Pride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YE have fashioned us creeds most fantastic,
G ye priests, with your rituals -vain ;
We have crawled, genuflective and plastic,
At the heels of an order inane !
Like the worms creeping blind in the garden
Have we crept down the vistas of time ;
We have wept —we have wallowed for pardon
When our souls, with a heart-beat sublime,
Should have raised up an anthem reliant,
Flinging forth to the scintillant stars
Not a whine but a war-song defiant,
So that God, as He peered thro’ the bars,
Might have cried : “ These men walk not on
crutches —
A crew strong of arm, fearless-eyed ; 1
A nation whose hand star-ward clutches,
And whose blood in a swift, crimson tide
Onward rolls — Wake! ye saints in your hutches,
And list to the Gospel of Pride ! ”
It is time that we cast off the shackles—
The traditions of priest and of pew ;
Let us fashion strong derricks and tackles,
And haul up a Faith bright and new !
Shall we cringe—are we always to palter,
Like children afraid of the dark ?
Must we shiver and mumble and falter ;
Or proudly at destiny’s mark
Shall we smite ? All too long have we pandered
To the prophets of weeping and gloom ;
Let us stablish a Gospel whose standard,
Unfurled in the chasuble’s room,
Shall encourage mankind, and shall lift them—
All the peoples who yearn for a guide ;
We shall build them a new Church, and shift them
From the rut wherein now they abide ;
And rearward the old things shall drift them,
When we publish our Gospel of Pride !

THE FICKLE DOLLY HOPGOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MISS DOLLY HOPGOOD was commonly
called “ Ginge,” an abbreviation of
Ginger, and a polite allusion to her
prevailing tint. She was a saucy young lady of
about sixteen, and lived in a push-ridden suburb.
Her hair was worn turned in a hard pad all round
her head, so that from a little distance it looked
very much as if she were wearing the pneumatic
cushion from Odgson’s office chair, as a sort of
halo. The dress in which she came to business
was of light-colored, limp material, ribbed with
cheap black lace, like the hoops on a barrel.
Her hat was a wide-rimmed “gem,” skewered
so far forward that in her walks it preceded her
by about half-a-yard ; the high-heeled boots she
affected accentuated the apparent precipitation of
Dolly’s top-hamper. She was a plump and
cheerful rapscallion, but her face had a certain
granite quality characteristic of the daughters of
slum families —a quality devised by an all-wise
Providence, no doubt, as a provision against in-
jury in contact with the bluchers of husbands and
lovers, the ardor of whose affection, when acceler-
ated by beer, is apt to express itself in kicks.
On the first appearance of Miss Hopgood the
packer greeted her with breezy familiarity. “ ’Ow
is it, Sis?” he said. “ FI ere, ain’t I seen you
proppin’ ther door at Crilly’s Assembly Toosday
nights ? ”
Benno grinned approvingly. “ Strike me,
Feathers, ye’ve fitted her in one ! ” he chortled.
Ginge certainly did suggest a larrikin hop.
“ Gart! git back t’ yer lorndry ! ” retorted the
young lady. The remark conveyed a playful in-
sinuation that Feathers and the clerk were of
ignominious Asiatic origin.
There was usually some little diffidence about
novitiates on the factory flat, but Miss Hopgood
betrayed not the smallest concern. “ Yow there,
Tilly ! Scratchin’ a livin’ ere, are yeh ? ” she cried
shrilly, shaking her crib basket at a distant paster.
The ex-professional fat girl caught her eye. Miss
Pilcher was wearing a superior expression. Ginge
raised her hand, and wagged playful fingers at
Martha. “ Buck up, puds,” she said; “you’re
all right. They’re payin’ quids a bar’l fer your
sort at Stonkie Watson’s.” Watson’s was the soap-
boiling establishment that gave rank to a riverside
suburb. The fat girl resented the insinuation
with a loathly sneer, and Ginge passed by in
triumph.
Ginge Hopgood was just as gaily impertinent
with the comps, and machine hands on the
printers’ flat, and hailed them from the stairs
with frank familiarity. Clinker Gill, one of the
feeders, .was Sophie Oddie’s boy, but Miss Hop-
good assumed possession without a trace of com-
punction. Clinker, greatly flattered to find him-
self the chief object of her somewhat personal
back-street flippancies, succumbed instantly, and
Sophie ceased to be an item in his daily life.
Possibly Clinker lived to repent his perfidy.
Sometimes he might have looked as if he did, but
he never admitted it. Master Gill was about x 7,
a round-headed lad with closely-mown black hair,
and a countenance the utter commonplaceness of
which beggared criticism. On the morning of
the fifth day after Miss ITopgood’s arrival, Clinker
came to work with a damaged eye, and all day
his manner was subdued, not to say penitent.
“How’d it ’appen, Ned?” asked Feathers,
when Gill came up with a bundle of printed tea
Papers.
“ Bit iv er dust-up with er bloke down ar way,”
said Clinker.
Feathers had all a woman’s curiosity about
details. “ S’pose th’ other lad won’t be leavin’
his bed this side Christmas ? ” he said.
l< Oh, I dunno.” Clinker was becomingly
modest. “ There ain’t nothin’ much wrong with
him, barrin’ two teeth out ’n’ er thick ear.”
“ Give us ther strength iv it, Ned. Did yeh
hand him ther pass out ? ”
Clinker Gill grew confidential. His opponent
was a rival claimant for Ginge’s favors. Miss
Hopgood had had another boy for some months,
a boy who was prepared to assert his prior rights
on the gory battlefield, and who had already done
so on two occasions, to Clinker’s great discom-
tort. The claimant’s name was Holland. He
was a stiff-built youth, with large freckles and a
tair down all over his face. Also, he was an im-
petuous and unscrupulous fighter, and lurked at
corners to intercept Clinker and Dolly, charging
down upon the former, and commencing hostilities
without fair and sufficient warning.
In the course of the following fortnight Clinker
had four scraps with Tommy Holland—wholly
unsatisfactory street “scrims” that werel-inter-
rupted by the appearance of a John, or the inter-
vention Of some benevolently-disposed old lady or
gentleman ; but the feeder always sustained more
or less damage, and he burned to fight a con-
clusive engagement with his hated rival. Appa-
rently there was no other way of settling the
matter in dispute, since Ginge could not be
brought to see that she was called upon to accept
. an y responsibility. The girl would not give a
decision. She’ might walk home with Clinker in
the evening, but she would stroll out with Tommy
at night, and Gill was the occasion of a most un-
usual Pleasant Sunday Afternoon in the Botanical
Gardens. He had discovered Holland reposing
by Miss Hopgood on the sward.
Truth to tell, neither young gentleman seemed
to expect Dolly to express any partiality, but the
packer sometimes reproached her in a frivolous
spirit. “Ain’t yeh announced yer choice yet,
Ginge?” he asked. “’Strewth, if yeh can’t
make up yer mind which is prettiest, why not toss
’em for it—double or quits ? ”
“Not me,” said Dolly. “ I ain’t took on
either of ’em for keeps. I,ain’t one fer tyin’
meself down.”
“ Then this’ere bloodshed is t’ continue to ther
bitter end ? ”
“My oath it is ! While these blokes is fightin’
each other, they ain’t fightin’ me—see ?” It was
a specimen of slum philosophy that tickled the
packer immensely.
“Jimmy Gee! You’re er bird,” he said, de-
lightedly. “ What you don’t know ain’t in ther
books.”
Clinker Gill came to Feathers’ board a few days
after this, with an air of great importance.
“ It’s all fixed up, Mills,” he said.
“ What,” cried the Packer, “ has she given yeh
brusher ? ”
Clinker wagged his round head confidently.
“No blinded fear,” he said; “Ginge knows
when she’s got a good thing. Ther fight’s
arranged ’tween me ’n’ th’ other bloke. We fight
ther prelim, to ther Bull Green ’n’ Coffee Hogan
scrap et ther Smithers-street Hathletic Club’s
room on Monday night fortnight, catch-weights,
fer harf-er-Jim ’n’ er five-bob side wager—eight
rounds, one t’ win.”
“Go on !” ejaculated Feathers, in proud ap-
preciation.
“Yes, Markis o’ Queensbee rules, four-ounce
gloves, ’n’ regerlation trunks. Prelimery starts
punctual et eight ; prices two, one, ’n’ er tizzie.
We’ve both signed harticles.”
“ Good e-nough,” cried the Packer. “ I must
*ave er deener’s worth iv that.”
During the following fortnight Clinker Gill was
the hero of Spats’ factory. He trained industri-
ously night and morning, and at lunch-time he
boxed vigorously on a full stomach in the lift-
corner with any good friend who would oblige
him with a generous hiding. Clinker got punch-
ing enough in 12 days to have made him indiffer-
ent to anything short of a mad bull-camel. The
bigger fellows nearly belted the head off him in
the kindliest spirit imaginable, believing they
were doing him a great favor, and everybody
offered him advice and gave him useful hints to
beginners, especially Benno the clerk. Mr. Dick-
son insisted with great wisdom on the necessity of
keeping a straight left. He committed himself
no further, but he impressed that one point on
Gill at least 20 times a day.
“ I sticks my left into ’em,” said Benno.
“Never do nothin’ else, but jab ’em with er
straight left ez they come in, savin’ me right fer er
finisher. ” Mr. Dickson had never fought a round
in his life, but he was very impressive, and Clinker
accepted his advice with proper respect.
Master Gill bought a shilling book on boxing,
and started to learn it off by heart, from cover to
cover ; but he was a poor study, and had only
mastered about three chapters relating to rules,
training, and attitudes, when the eventful night
arrived.
The room of the Smithers-street Athletic Club
was over a threepenny hair-cut saloon in a cheap,
crowded suburb. It was a small, low, dark
apartment, with a tiny ring in the centre, and
just space enough between the ropes and one wall
for the high-priced patrons to creep to the cramped
gallery rising abruptly from the ring side to the
roof. The cheap “sports” were packed in a
space 12ft. x 12ft. on the other side of the roped
enclosure, and a third set of supporters gathered
on the roof on the occasion of a really popular
engagement, and looked down on the warfare
through the broken shingles. In the course of
the battle the proprietor of the threepenny saloon
went among these latter with a collection box,
and any spectator refusing to contribute was sum-
marily chucked off. The chucking entailed a
fall of 6ft. on to an adjoining roof.
Feathers, Benno, the Don, and several comps,
from the factory occupied seats in the shilling
reserve, the top half of the gallery close to the
roof, where the smoke accumulated and the heat
of perdition assailed them. For it was a summer
night, and the room was packed as tight as it
could hold with baking humanity, half of whom
tugged at pipes which sizzled like frying-pans and
stank like future punishment. The other half
smoked cigarettes. .
Benno took immediate steps to let it be known
that he was a personal friend of one of the boxers,
and in all probability had taught the lad all he
knew, and then, finding nobody disposed to bet
on the preliminary, he offered five to four on
Clinker Gill. “Five t’ four in quids,’ he said,
addressing a “ tough ” who was nursing a brindle
bulldog with a face like a Japanese nightmare.
Putting a trace of pleading in his voice, he added:
“ Come on, Ned, be er sport. I’ll say six t four
ther Clinker outs him inside iv five rounds. me
tough answered hoarsely that he hadn’t four mts,

THE WELL-ADVISED HEVER NEGLECT
KIDNEY DISEASE.
The best advice that can he given to anyone suffering
from urinary troubles, weakness of the bladder, backache,
headache, watery swellings round the ankles or under
the eyes, constant tiredness s dizziness, broken sleep,
ringing in the ears, or irregular heart, is to take Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills at once, for they cure the kidneys,
and therefore cure all these symptoms of kidney and
bladder disease.

Good Advice
From a Sydney Man.
Mr. Thomas E. Wilkinson, Dyer and Cleaner, 366 Oxford-street,
Paddington, says :—“ I suffered from various symptoms, which arose from
disordered kidneys. I had a very severe pain in the small of my back ;
my secretions were at times very thick, and I had a touch of rheumatics.
After taking a number of remedies, which proved failures, I was recom-
mended to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I did so, and after taking
the first box I felt better, and went on taking them. After I had taken
thirty boxes I found myself cured. I recommend these pills to all who
suffer with kidney disorder ; they alone proved of any benefit to me.”
Mr. Wilkinson makes a second statement:—“ I have been free of
kidney trouble ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, years

DOAN'S OINTMENT
CURES EVERY TORTURING SKIN IRRITATION.
Eczema.
Mr. H. Boyd, 8 St. Andrew’s-street,
Balmain, Sydney, says:—“My little boy
has suffered with Eczema ever since he was
six months old. He was very bad indeed.
We had to muffle his hands and cover his
head to keep him from scratching. The
irritation was frightful, especially at night
time after he had been put to bed. We were
always using one remedy or another, but
nothing seemed able to give him relief until
we got Doan’s Ointment. A friend advised
me to use this preparation. She had used it
with great success on one of her children, and
told me that she was quite sure it would do
my boy good. Six boxes effected a complete
cure ; not a sign of the ailment remains. It
acted marvellously from the first, every
application giving instant relief.”
Mrs. Boyd says, three years later: “My
little boy is still free of the Eczema. It is
not possible for a remedy to do more than
Doan’s Ointment has done for him—a perfect
and permanent cure.”
Piles.
Mr. J. G. Carter, jun., 182 Bulwayo Road,
Ultimo, Sydney, says:—“l can strongly
recommend Doan’s Ointment. For two
years I suffered agony from protruding and
itching Piles, the pain and irritation were
almost unbearable. I could scarcely get
about, and could not sleep at night. I was
very bad, and could not get relief, although
I tried everything I could hear of, and got
treatment from doctors. Fortunately Doan’s
Ointment was recommended to me. I com-
menced to use it, carefully following the
directions. Relief came after the first appli-
cation, and I persevered with the treatment
until I had used three pots. I am abso-
lutely right, and it is twelve months since I
used the ointment. Seeing how good Doan’s
Ointment proved for Piles, I used it for
Eczema, which had broken out all over me ;
it was very painful and itchy, as well as
most unsightly, but Doan’s Ointment again
proved its genuine merit, and absolutely and
completely banished all trace of the ail-
ment.” .
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d,
per pot, or will be posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan Co.,
76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
and the dog growled in a venomous way, so
Benno did not press his point.
At 20 past 8 Tommy Holland came into the
ring, followed a few minutes later by Clinker Gill
and his seconds, two lads from a racing stable
with which Clinker was acquainted. Tommy
Holland looked strong and confident, but Clinker
was pale and very nervous. He trembled visibly,
his knees knocked as he sat in his chair. One of
the seconds noticed this, and kicked the lad
disgustedly.
“ See ’ere, Clink,” he said, “ drop yer bundle,
’n’ make er guy iv me, ’n’ I’ll pelt yeh er few
meself.”
Clinker’s lip trembled, and a tear rolled down
his cheek, which he wiped with his glove.
The M.C. and official announcer was in the ring.
He was a retired lightweight run to flesh, and
sported a face like a freak potato.
“Gents,” he said, addressing the dress circle,
“ I’ll ask yez kindly t’ put out yer smokes ’n’
give ther boys er charnce. Youse,” he added,
turning with some fierceness on the sixpenny
patrons, “ stop smokin’ ’r ye’ll land in ther fat.
Don’t let me ’ave ter talk t’ yer agin. Gents,” he
repeated, softening his voice, “ this ’ere’s er per-
liminry iv eight rounds, ’tween er pair iv
unknowns. I may tell yeh it’s all erbout er bit
iv skirt, ’n’ I think I can promise yeh er dead
willin’ go. Nar then, lads, get ready.”
The announcer then joined the seconds, and
there was some argument over the appointment of
a referee. During the discussion Clinker’s ner-
vousness increased to such an extent that he began
to whimper piteously, mopping up his tears with
his gloves.
The announcer stepped forward again. “Is
Mr. Peter Nickie present in th’ ’all ? ” he cried.
Mr. Nickie was present. He arose with dignity.
He was a fat and florid bookmaker, with a
reputation for paying successful backers with
stoush. “Both parties is willin’ t’ ’ave you
referee this ere, Pete,” said the announcer, and
Peter obligingly rolled through the ropes, and
swayed into a corner. Mr. Nickie was now seen
to be lamentably drunk. He propped himself
securely against a post.
“Is yez all ready ?” he said. “ Shake ’an’s ! ”
The boys advanced into the centre, Clinker
pushed behind by his second, and touched gloves.
They returned to their corners, and the timekeeper
smote the gong, a superannuated dinner tray. “Box
on ! ” gurgled the referee, and Clinker Gill faced
his enemy. Clinker was snivelling; his face was
very white; there was a wild look in his eye. The
boys circled round and round, moving their hands
mechanically. For a whole minute there was no
attempt to strike a blow ; then Tommy rushed
furiously, whirling his arms, and Clinker went
down. He rose again, still weeping, and Holland
rushed him again, and again Gill was prostrated
by the impact. On his hands and knees, his face
pathetically contorted, and tears streaming down
his cheeks, Clinker seemed to be looking for a
way of escape, but all exits were blocked. It
seemed as if the whole world was screaming
derision at him. He arose, and Tommy charged
him. Utterly demoralised, Clinker turned and
ran. He ran three times round the ring, hotly
pursued by Tommy Holland, and the onlookers
roared with laughter. After the third lap Tommy
overtook Gill, and hit him in the small of the
back, and Clinker fell again. While he was
down the gong sounded, and the pride of Spats’
factory was dragged into his corner, and sat there,
blubbering dismally, while his seconds fanned
him, and covered him with scoffing and curses.
Tommy Holland came straight from his corner
at the sound of the gong, and hit Clinker hard on
the nose, and Clinker went to the floor. Clinker
got up, and Tommy hit him again. “Yeh
blinded cow ! ” squealed Gill, and he whirled a
glove on to Tommy's ear. He hurled his left,
and hit Tommy on the mark. The crowd
applauded. Clinker’s blubbering was loud now,
but there was a note of anger in it. He charged
at his opponent, head down, and pounded with
both hands. Clinching he got Holland’s head
under his arm, and punched him five times on the
nose, while Tommy’s seconds howled for a foul
and the referee nodded in his corner, swaying on
the ropes.
When the gong clashed the boxers continued
fiercely fighting, and Clinker’s seconds had to tear
him off. Benno was applauding like a madman,
and yelling advice. The crowd was delighted.
Clinker made a dash out of his chair to get at
the foe again, and had to be carried struggling to
the seat. He was no longer pale, and his nervous-
ness had evaporated. The third round was full of
fight. Clinker waded in. He forgot all he had
learned, and utterly ignored Benno’s wise advice.
He hit in holds, he hit anyhow ; he butted, and
palmed, and screwed, and broke every known
rule. Tommy had a cut lip, a bleeding ear, and
a mouse on one eye. Again the pride of Spats’
had to be torn from his opponent.
The boys spent the greater part of the fourth
round on the floor, but time was not wasted.
They fought there just as well as anywhere else,
pasting each other desperately. Clinker bumped
Tommy’s nose against the boards, and while the
crowd roared and laughed, the master of cere-
monies woke up the referee, and expostulated
profanely. Mr. Nickie blinked about vaguely,
realised where he was, and murmured :
“Sh all ready ? Shake ’an’s.”
When the two minutes were up, the seconds
had to disentangle the boys, and drag them to
their corners.
“Yiv got ’im done in, Clinker!” yelled the
passionate Benno. “ He’s your mutton. Keep
that left goin’ how 1 told yeh, ’n’ it’s er moral.”
But Clinker was deaf and blind to everything
but his mighty wrath. He charged Tommy, and
felled him, he smote him on the chin as he was
rising, and Tommy clung to his legs, and climbed
up by them, and punched Clinker in the left eye,
putting that organ completely out of action. In
the sixth they were both very tired, but continued
to fight like terriers. In the seventh Clinker had
Holland down three times, but in the eighth and
last Tommy freshened up, and made it very will-
ing. They finished on the floor, punching, claw-
ing, and even kicking.
The lads were carried to their chairs, and once
more the referee was shaken up.
“ Hello ! what’s matter ? ” said Mr. Nickie.
“Er decision —give er decision, blarst it!”
hissed the master of ceremonies behind his hand.
Mr. Peter Nickie bucked up, he moved into the
centre of the ring, and held aloft an impressive
palm.
“ Gen’lemen,’ ; he said —“ Smith the winner !”
“ ’Ere, ’ere,” hissed the M.C., “there ain’t no
Smith in ther fight ! ”
“ Wha’s that?” said the referee, staggering to
the ropes.
‘ ‘ I say they ain’t no Smith in ther fight. Which
lad are yeh givin’ it to ? ”
“Smith the winner!” repeated Mr. Nickie,
with the air of a man of marked integrity.
“ But, dammitall, they ain’t no Smith ! ”
“ Look ’ere, Spud Malone,” said Mr. Nickie
with great dignity, ‘ ‘ are you refereein’ thish fight,
’r’m I ? ”
“ But I tell yeh they ain’t no Smith.”
“ Wha’ thell I care? Smith the winner !”
Then the referee rolled out of the ring and fell
into his seat, and the battered boys were led
away to the changing room downstairs, while the
overjoyed crowd, more delighted with the fight
than it would have been with a pantomime, sim-
mered down for the serious business of the evening.
The error of Mr. Nickie left things practically
as they were with Clinker Gill and Tommy
Holland ; and Dolly, who had spent the night of
the fight in full enjoyment of a “ darnce ” at the
Sixpenny Quadrille, remained perfectly impartial,
so far as they were concerned. This was fair,
since it could be demonstrated quite satisfactsrily
that Clinker had won on points and Tommy had
won on a foul.
On the Saturday night, 12 days later, two young
gentlemen were leaning in fraternal sympathy
against the front of a cobbler’s shop in the push-
ridden suburb. They were Clinker Gill and
Tommy Holland. Some traces of their battle
lingered on the countenances of both, but they
were now bosom friends, drawn together by a
common sorrow. A young lady passed, walking
daintily on high-heeled shoes, with a characteristic
projection of the figure, and wearing a large hat
liberally feathered. By her side walked a young
man, his thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest, his
hat hung precariously on the back of his head, a
blazer screaming the local football colors tossed
about his neck, his cold grey eye defying creation.
Clinker nudged Tommy Holland. “ There she
goes,” he whispered.
“ Let ’er,” growled Holland, “ ther nark ! ”
The passing fair was Ginge Hopwood. The
young gentleman in charge was “ Nigger” Tish,
a promising welterweight. And now Clinker and
Tommy have resigned all pretensions to Dolly’s
favor, knowing themselves hopelessly out-classed.

City Hunger.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THOUGH the weather is perfection,
And in every direction
The scene would almost wake a
sense of beauty in a mole ;
Though I’m conscious of no ailment,
Or just reason for bewailment,
Yet languor and disgust have got possession of
my soul.
At my feet the small waves prattle,
Overhead the palm trees rattle,
Shaking glossy plumes and flirting with the baby
winds at play.
Turquoise streaks and purple patches
Shade a sea no blueness matches,
And a sister island rises just across the narrow way.
But I’m sick of blue sea reaches.
Glistening foam and dazzling beaches,
And the sight and sound of brown folk are no
less than an offence ;
For a city long forsaken
Of my heart a lease has taken,
So it’s time to pack my bag and fill my purse and
get me hence.
I can hear the motors thrumming,
And the trams go roaring, humming ;
The news-boys and the rabbit-oh’s make music in
my brain.
Yes, I’d land with but a dollar,
And a single shirt and collar
(If need were), to live on counter-lunch and doss
in the Domain.
Oh ! to hear the swish and rustle
Of silk petticoats a-bustle,
For a glimpse of stockinged ankles and of neatly-
booted feet !
Shall I skip with glee, I wonder,
When I feel the pavement under
And mingle with the keen-faced men who thread
the busy street ?
Oh ! to look on bricks and mortar,
To enjoy a draught of porter,
To dine again in decency where glass and linen
gleam !
In a hansom to be bowling
Past the crowds at night-time strolling,
When the shops are all a-glitter and the ways are
all a-stream !
In the ancient gathering places
Shall I see the same old faces ?
(Right gladly would I greet again an uncle from
Fiji !)
For six weeks I’ll hold high revel,
Banish every small blue devil,
And then —farewell to Sydney stones and back to
savagery !
Drive her southward, ancient skipper ;
Make your tub for once a clipper.
Drive her south for Sydney Pleads, and mind the
Reef as you go down.
If the years were mine to tender,
I would cheerfully surrender
A whole decade of the Islands for twelve months
of Sydney town.

EIGHT YEARS SUFFERING.
A PERMANENT CURE.
> 1 \
THE CASE OF MRS. A. WEAVER.
BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.
No one can tell the self-denying work which
good men have done in the early*days of this
country, neither can we exaggerate the nobleness
of spirit which animates present-day people in a
desire to ameliorate distress as much as lies in their
power. Therefore, the public should be informed
of some of these efforts, one of which was made by
Mrs. Alice Weaver, of No. 7 Louis Street, Redfern,
who replied to the reporter by saying ;■ —
“About this time last year I was living in
Tetopea Street, and it was just before I left there
for this place that I was fortunate in casting aside
a complaint that had worried me for no less than
eight years. What a fearful life of suffering mine
had been all that time, to be sure, and to think that
nothing in the world could benefit me made my
spirits droop lower than they will ever be again,
I hope.”
“What made yon think that nothing could
benefit you ? ” queried the writer.
“ I arrived at that conclusion because nothing
had done me good so far, and I believe I tried
every medicine going. At the time my second
child was born I was under a doctor, who did
everything he could for me, but still my health re-
mained as bad as it could be. Indeed, at that
period I was nearly dead with indigestion, al-
though I dieted myself and did all that could be
done to keep my torments in check. It was of no
avail, though, for when I ate anything I could
hardly breathe owing: to a feeling which came like
a lump in my chest, from which place a sharp pain
went right through to the centre of my shoulders.
I then remained in the utmost agonv until the food
was vomited up again, after which I felt so ex-
hausted that I could not think of doing a thing in
the house until I had had a good rest. It would
surprise you if you only knew how poor my appetite
was. You would wonder how anyone could keep
alive with it, and as for my head, oh, my sufferings
with it were awful. The most piercing pains at
onetime, and themost depressingachesat another.
Really, I think it was a marvel how I kept my
senses with the agony I endured in the head ; and
it’s strange that I did not meet with many a nasty
accident through the giddiness which used to over-
take me. I was a misery to myself and everybody
around me, and to tel] you the honest truth I never
thought I would live through it all. My eyes used
to feel heavy enough to drop out of their sockets,
and I was affected in the mouth by such a bitter
taste that it made me feel sick of a morning, after
putting in the usual restless nights that had done
mu6h towards making a wreck of me. Even in the
daytime Iwasalwaysimagining soinethipg terrible
was going to happen, and these were just the very
things that Clements Tonic, which I commenced to
take, showed itself to be the master of ; for it sent
such a vigor through nay frame, when I had been
taking it a couple of weeks, that I could not help
feeling joyful in the belief that at last toy health
had taken a beneficial turn. I got more Clements
Tonic, and as each bottle was finished, so did my
prospects improve, for I commenced to take my
meals with a degreeof heartiness which astonished
my people as much as it pleased them ; and to my
own satisfaction and delight theformer discomforts
attending my meals were quickly out of existence.
Oh, dear, what a changed woman I am now to then.
My limbs do not ache from weakness like they
formerly did, and I can go about my work as
cheerfully and as actively as any housewife in the
country. Ido not spend any restless nights now;
never dream during my sleep, and the pains that
used to abound have long since been driven away
from every part of my body. Well, Clements
Tonic made me the healthy woman I am, and for
the sake of other sufferers I trust you’ll publish
this interview in any way you think fit.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Alice Weaver, of No. 7 Louis Street, Redfern, in the
State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of Australia,
do solemnly and sincerely declare that I have carefully
read the annexed document, and that it contains, and is
a true and faithful account of my illness and cure by
Clements Tonic, and also contains my full permission to
publish in any way my statements, which I give voluntary,
without receiving any payment, and I make this solemn
declaration conscientiously believing the same to he true,
and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1900.
