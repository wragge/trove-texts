Music and Letters
•Replying to :i circular from Joiix o’
IjONdon, various literary per.suns have a
word to say of music. Conrad “loves it
without knowledge, but with a great, pro-
found emotion.” May Sinclair loves it, too.
unreasonably and to excess.” Eden i’hill-
potts doesn’t mind listening to music when
opportunity offers. ’ Galsworthy is fond of
music but can’t bear Wagner. Wells likes
“classical and some modern music very
mucli, but not to the extont of going to the
opera. Music has to come to me. and I
don’t want more than an hour of it at a
time.’ Chesterton is “so ignorant of music
™ at ke doesn’t even mind it.” And Hugh
alpole “enjoys music immensely, but would
always read a good book before lie would
go to a concert.’’
Ernest Newman; the big. musical critic, is
rude about it. naturally. He says, in effect
that with the exceptions of May Sinclair
and Conrad English literary people are
idiots. lie is worried because "for most of
them music is evidently a more or less
agreeable form of ear-massage or nerve-mas-
sage tin' pleasure being on about the same
intellectual level as face-massage at the hair-
dresser’s.lfe goes bn more or less venom-
ously about it, and complacently buttons-
up the subject witli: "A Beethoven can
express in music all lie thinks about life
with the same certainty, the same profun-
dity, the same subtlety, as a Shalcspeare can
in verso, or a Conrad in prose." Which is
a chuck in" for Conrad, but otherwise a
thundering bad sentence hampered by “ter-
minological inexactitude.” A Beethoven
can t do those things in music, and no ex-
ponent of that secondary art can or ever
could.
At first principles music is a children’s
pastime, artificially complicated, .when you
get to last principles, to an auxiliary, of'the
primary arts’ expression. The primary arts
enlarge and develop; they march with the
mind of man. The secondary arts develop
onjy as they are needed by the primary;
otherwise they stand still or are retrograde
ragtime throwing back to the negroid liiating-
songs. or musical comedy to the lmrem-
dances or to Attila’s feasts after the battles.
Musical expression in its finer shades is
comprehensible only to musicians, which
means that as general, expression it is in-
articulate. v Even Newman’s two pet lambs
can tdo better than that for him. He points
to them proudly, but Conrad loves “without
knowledge,” and Miss Sinclair “unreasonably
and to excess.” Who ever loved an art too
well or in ignorance? That is the fate of
wme, and woman, and, of course, song; the
bracketing of the three is apt. For the
lest all the literary idiots are right; music
speaks only to the emotions, and only very
broadly to them. It is a pleasure or a pain
—an emotion-massage—and no more. At its
highest it is correlated with the emotion of
religious fervor, and at its lowest with that
oi: the mating of aboriginal man. Set free
from correlation it is the wind in the trees
or on the sea artificially tamed to express
tear, martial pride, love, lust and sorrow;
but no finer shades even of emotion and no
continuous' thought.
Those forthright statements being set down
without malice, I will try to prove them
before the musician reading this hursts. The
primary arts are letters, painting and sculp-
tuie, inasmuch as they express all the shades
of creative imagination to the largest bodv
ot humanity, which is the function of art.
The simplest and clearest of these three is
letters, because its medium is the common
form of human communication. For that
reason it is the art brought nearest of the
three to perfection. Everybody uses it,
trom the office-boy writing a valentine to
the king drawing up a treaty of peace; so
those who write their thoughts for public
reading must be pastmasters, their critics in
technique being the population of the world.
Thoil school is the hardest of the three, and
by natural sequence .tlieir success in expres-
sion the greatest. E.f/.. a subordinate char-
acter can be written with certainty and
clarity in a dozen sentences; in a picture or
m sculpture the character can only very
rarely be shown with equal force and'detail
and never with as little expenditure of
aitistic effort. Of the other arts, primary
and secondary, the writers are the iudge's
for the layman—judges and interpreters of
imaginative expression needing the ambassa-
dorship of letters for his understanding.
So letters is the universal art showing its
own imaginings as clearly and sharply as
the marching centuries have forced it to
show them in the hard school of universal
criticism. There is never any uncertainty as
to the meaning of a good book. Which can-
not always be said of the details of a good
picture or sculpture. Sometimes the critic
can make liis own meanings for the most im-
pressive creations of painters and sculptors.
But not in good letters; the kings and the
office-boys have seen to that. They forced
the catholic art in which they shared a pen
with Homer to remain as articulate and
direct as their own speech in its interpre-
tation of thought.
The secondary arts are acting, architec-
ture and music. The subordination of the
stage to letters, and of architecture to paint-
ing and sculpture, is obvious. There remains
music, which in a small measure is relative
to letters (music being the balance of sound
and sound), but otherwise is not even a
secondary art. For_ the reason that we can-
not pin its expression down with any cer-
tainty it is not an art at all.
The “Marseillaise” is a splendid battle-
song on whose tide millions of men have
willingly died : but where does the music tell
me it is for France, which is the soul of
the thing? The Baeh-Gounod “Ave Maria”
flows, warm and passionate, over countless
hearts every Sunday, a beseeching of Mary’s
prayers for sinners; yet I would say it was
a serenade in some Spanish midnight. The
Russian opera cries out in sorrow and
despair heart-breaking to hear: hut sorrow
for what cause? I have the programme, it
is true, and I remember the history of
Russia: hut why should expression—even
secondary expression—need that machinery?
The Niebelungen Ring transports me into a
place of such gorgeous sound upon sound
that lam in a fervor of bodily ecstasy. But
in its drunkenness I learn nothing beyond
the splendor of the sound beating upon
sound; nothing more is expressed to me. If
I were not in a church with the lights, the
long lines of the arches and the praying mul-
titude the B-minor Mass would be only the
wind in the trees or on the sea. It would be
•better so; I could make my own reading of
the sensual pleasure in freedom. As it is,
you and I can take all the music we have
heard and read our moods into it for mean-
ing—bring our own expression, in fact.
Fluctuating sound and sound is not enough
for the spirit of an art. It is enough for
ope large idea, as mating birds or Zulus,
men heartening for battle, a lover sighing
in an empty garden, or the men come back
from the battle to the food and the earned
rest. But that is all. It is a bodily thing,
as those English enemies of Ernest New-
man’s all say. And an art is first of the soul
and afterwards of the mind giving imagina-
tive information to other minds.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
The Short Story
My daily job of reading stories for
popular English magazine includes a prettj
dose perusal of the work of nearly all the
leading American fiction-writers; anc
although, it is true that some of the besi
stories we buy come from across the Atlantic
practically all have to be ruthlessly cut
and !K.) per cent, never “get past” on account
of the seething mass of words from which
the story has to be extricated. American
editors are said to demand padding for com-
mercial reasons—in order to spread the
stories out over the back pages of their maga-
zines and make the advertiser's lot a happy
one. (We all know that fiendish footnote
to American yarns, “Continued on Page
97(5524.”') Since the American editor pays
well for his padding, the author can hardly
be blamed for pandering to this thirst for
words; but the habit certainly militates
against him when he tries to sell his stuff in
England.
The best length for an English magazine
story is 5000 words, for the British Empire
serial rights of which the writer may be
paid 10 guineas or 50. The price is a
matter of supply and demand. If you have
a steady public as a novelist or a consistent
market for your stories in the magazines,
you can ask at least five guineas a thousand
words and be fairly sure of getting it; but
you have to work up your trade like any
other craftsman. For the British serial rights
in a novel by a writer of any note £lOOO is
commonly paid by the magazines, and .since
lie will probably get still higher rates for
his American serial rights it will be seen
that there is money in the game when he
knows how to play it.
The Australian stories that “get past” at
present are almost invariably written by
people who know the English market. Every
casual Australian story that has come into
my hands in six months lias been too slight
—too essentially a newspaper sketch, which
is something quite different from the type
of fiction wanted by the English,,, monthlies.
Yet there is a real opening for any new-
comer who will give the editors what they
want. This is not necessarily literature
(unfortunately), because the people who
want to read literature do not buy the popu-
lar magazines. Studies in psychology and
atmosphere, however delicate and brilliant,
have a slender chance unless there is a big
name to carry them off. but the story of
action may be a little gold-mine, even if it
also happens to be literature. "
Every now and then the literary weeklies
set out to tell the poor author what the
editors want. They mean well, but they
generally tell him nothing in the end. Only
one editor lias ever given me a workable for-
mula. lie said: “Plot is. roughly speak-
ing. opposition. Your characters should be
up against it and should get something done
instead of leaving the dirty work to Provi-
dence.” That so far is satisfactory because
it rules out many time-worn gags—-conveni-
ent deaths, sudden fortunes and the dear old
long arm of coincidence. Real surprise, a
good climax, and a plot that begins to
thicken in the first five lines are also ingredi-
ents of the saleable short story.
ALICE GRANT ROSMAN.
Some Old Masters
Sir Itay Lankester. who. like his teacher
Huxley, combines profound scientific learning
with a gift for popular exposition, has pub-
lished anew volume of his scientific essays
(Secrets of Earth and Sea , Methuen), in
which he discourses on many biological and
other problems. The most interesting of the
papers are those in which he illustrates the
drawings from the south of France wherein
the cave-men depicted the animals that
they saw about them. Of these drawings the
best -is one done on a red-deer antler showing
a group of red-deer turning to run from an
enemy, and the extraordinary thing is that
one cannot make head or tail of the picture
.until one inks the cylinder and prints it off
on a flat surface.
This was a false dawn of engraving; dark-
ness returned, and the real dawn did not
come till modern times. Probably it was
also the dawn of dress-ornamentation. Other
pictures, drawn with a sort of burin, on
tusks, shoulder-blades and the walls of caves,
depict the mammoth, cave-bear and others of
the animals which flourished 50.000 years
ago in Europe. Though there are some child-
ish mistakes in drawing, still there is a fail-
attempt at perspective; for sureness of line
and vividness of the impressions conveyed
these little engravings cannot be surpassed ;
and the world saw nothing to compare with
them till the sudden great flaring up of
Greek art in the sixtii century b.c. Assyrian
and Egyptian art are conventional beside
them. The drawings of the mammoth give
one an uncanny feeling that the artist was
actually looking at the great beast as he
drew; the mammoth swings his trunk, or

Summer.
Jacarandas leaning up
Steal the color from the cup
Of the blue cloisonne sky.
Charmed with his own prismy grace,
Mirrored in the water’s face
Swings the irised dragon-fly.
Ope the door and come away!
Beneath the oleander-tree
Pink shadows lie upon the grass;
Mangoes yellow lusciously
And honey-eaters all the day
Dart and swing and sip and pass
From rich to richer golden spray
Of blossom in the silky-oak.
And there blows like silver smoke
Over the lucerne by the river
A little secret, impish breeze
That when all else is parched and still
Will set the barley-field ashiver.
Now cicadas soar and shrill,
And crickets on brown fiddles play,
And old, unlovely, ashen trees
Wrapped in blue convolvulus flowers
Are fairy towers, are fairy towers!
Fling a kiss and come away!
With what a gay, delicious air,
Sticking red blossoms in her hair,
Pomegranate displays her ware
Of quaint, squat bowls all verdigrised T
Oh, let’s no more be dull and wise,
Pinching youth that age may feast!
We that could run hand in hand
Where cool and clear the breakers rise
Ali all day above the sand!
And giving old age ne’er a thought
Could splash and leap and laugh, and lie
Like prisoners in green amber caught,
Watching the foam fly dizzily up
Until the moonlight-cactus’ cup
Turned white as Heaven, and you and I
Knew that the moon grew gold above
And it was time to talk of love! -

Day is done and night comes on,
Loneliness once more takes hold;
All the sportive clan has gone,
Tired and happy, young and old.
Comes the south wind with *er broom
Sweeping clean the sluggish air,
Leaps a campfire in the gloom
With a last red, dying glare.
Still is all the iaughter now
That made loud the glowing noon;
Calls a mopoke from his bough,
By the creeks the sheoaks croon.
Cooled and sweetened by the breeze,
Rank on rank and row on row,
Back to slumber sink the trees,
Dreaming dreams no man may know.
Speeding homeward Wing to wing
Hie the whimpering waterfowl,
Through the white trunks, glimmering
In the last light, hoots an owl.
Lighting up a fronded spot,
Fern and leaf, the fireflies glow;
Somewhere, though I see him not,
Goes a Green God to and fro.
By the way the gumtreeS tense,
Dumb and silent, bow in prayer,
Mute in syivan reverence,
Know I that he wanders there.
Lifting broken frond and limb,
Grieving at the work of man,
At the ruin wrought by him,
Through the shadows wanders Pan.
Here are flowers with petals wide
Ravished by rude hands and rash,
Here he sees a sapling’s side
Gaping with a ruddy gash.
• Yonder, where he loved to sport,
Ambling o’er the dewy grass,
• No more shall the thrushes court—
Done to death they lie, alas!
Ruined blooms to left and right,
Riven roots and scattered seed—
He shall pipe no tune to-night,
Rather shall he weep, indeed !
Under glimmering star and moon,
Cursing, hating all the clan
That made loud his woods at noon,
Through the shadow wanders Pan.

How life pupates through chrysalids of Time !
Each age its wisdom writes ; then changes
ring
To newer songs that newer times may sing.
Rhymes that were rhymes to-day no longer
rhyme,
And stairs are gone by which man used to
climb —
Man who, from clay to wheel, and sail,
and wing,
Reaching for all that widening eras bring,
By thought expressed in deed arose from
slime!
Ah, when my child once questioned on a
name,
And asked would Time still keep an
ancient book,
Shaken, a thought ran through me like a
flame,
How that, some day, strange eyes should
on it look.
And someone wondering pause (so much
times vary),
Asking who Jesus was, or who was Mary?

“WE WANT SOVIETS.”
“After great disorder, the ‘lnternational’ was
sung, followed by cries of ‘We want Soviets!’ The
fIoJTVuV/VVZV e y tVZViI °f th r e h J hts -V
Uc7 meetno ( } ° ° P
c
All sorts ot people are clamoring for
sovipts just now—revolutionaries, unionists
and even some Tories. Confusion exists be-
cause different meanings are attached to the
word, which is of the pantechnicon variety :
it can be taken to signify almost anything,
To many thousands it stands for anarchy,
though originally it only meant government
by “committees,” which is the antithesis of
anarchy. Brown, who has a touch of homi-
cidal mania, sees in soviets the opportunity
to safely murder some hated individual or
class; Smith, kindly and sentimental, asso-
ciates soviets with the Millennium ; to
Robinson they merely represent a form of
decentralisation which he has noticed work-
ing well in other places than Russia—pos-
sibly in his own large and prosperous busi-
ness. To most of these people the new poli-
tical notion—new, that is, in the sense that
• 11 ] revived fashions <ire new—is a certain
antidote against poverty, the obligation to
work selfishness and 2’reed nride and the
lust for prnver anl in S er the factors
IUSI ioi powti, cilia m geneiji tne iactois
which have made human beings miserable
+hrourh the a°- P s There never was a time
miougn rne a & _s. anere nevei was a time
anywhere when some such panacea was
absent from the minds of reformers and
oosenr iiom uit minus oi rerormers ana
those who make a good thing out of reform
movements. In England, towards the end
of the 12tn century Milliam of the Long
Beard, who caked himself the saviour of
the poor,” started a revolutionary movement
which many believed would end the troubles
of those who lacked money and position.
The secret frith-guilds of the unenfranchised
craftsmen of London, which operated after
William’s sudden and violent end, were
soviets. The Diggers of the 17th century
took up the same attitude as the Russian
moujiks did the other day. The Diggers
didn’t seize the property of the rich (they
weren’t numerous enough), but they applied
to the sectional cultivation of waste lanu uie
same communistic principles which character-
ised the early stages of the Russian revolu-
tion ; and like the Russian they were con-
vinced they had lighted on an idea that
would bring Heaven back to earth. The
parallel between the communism of lbth
century France and 20th-century Russia has
been drawn repeatedly of late years. Some-
times the road to the desired goal—a goal
which is invariably the same, namely, a
state of affairs in which all men shall be
brotherly and free—is only indirectly asso-
ciated with soviets or socialism. When pro-
letariat Britain was groaning under the
tyranny of its industrial and land-owning
uarons, the slogan was Freetrade. In Ire-
land for about seven centuries it has been
Homo Rule. After every great exhibition of
militarism it is disarmament, and in any
centre where drunkenness is king there is
pretty sure to be a chance for a prohibition
movement, which was why the Pussyfooters
had such high hopes in Scotland last month,
and which explains—in part, anyhow—the
measure of success they had in Glasgow.
The modern yearning for soviets is, then,
an imagined Specific against some form of
tyranny. Where are our tyrants? The laws
and Constitution of England, which, broadly,
are ours, are supposed to represent together
an impregnable defence against tyranny. In
practice, however, we have plenty of tyrants
and their, number is growing. They tyran-
nise, to use the Yankee phrase, “within the
law.’’ The stewards who are now on strike
have caused more want and suffering pro-
bably in the last week or so than all 'the
trail-bastons who lived by robbing or black-
mailing in Edward I.’s reign. ’ The stewards,
like the members of hundreds of other organ-
ised bodies, subscribe when in work to what
may be called a holiday or, again, a foray
fund. Every now and then —like those in
the other organised industries —they decide
to take a vacation and make the community
pay through the nose for it, just as the
club-men of Edward I.’s day did. The prin-
ciple and results are the same, though the
methods may be different, and the modern
' procedure is much safer. Edward treated
club-men, when caught, even more harshly
than strikers were treated in tile time of the
Combination Laws. The stewards, like all
strikers, justify the damage done by them
to the inoffensive and weak on the same
grounds as the trail-bastons. Two wrongs,
they claim, make a right. Their chief point
is that robbery, swindling, profiteering or
whatever the selected phrase happens to be,
is rife; that shopkeepers, barristers, squat-
ters, manufacturers and importers are all
doing it. and that they have to be in the
movement. In theory, Governments ought
to be able to deal with organised brigandage,
in the interests of the State ; and it is pretty
certain, incidentally, that in any country
where the Government was able to do it
there would be no talk of soviets. But things
fail to work out in that way. Governments,
like unions, are but human in their composi-
tion. Their members have eyes to the main
chance like other men. The rich and the
powerful recognise this and turn it to their
own good. Two remarkable examples have
been afforded recently. A cable mentioned
last week that the Prime Minister of Eng-
land had bhen handed, to go with his office
in perpetuity, an estate and house worth
£250,000; the Prime Minister of Australia
has just been given £25,000, and further sub-
scriptions are still coming in. Now, neither
of these gifts had anything to do with the
nation. They came from a handful of rich
men. Even if the charitable view is taken
that they represent neither payment for ser-
vices rendered, nor advances made in expecta-
tion of favors to come, such transactions are
open to criticism. It may have nothing to
do with their recent association with finan-
cial magnates, but the fact remains that both
Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. W. M. Hughes,
who were Radicals before the war, are now
Conservatives, and daily grow more re-
actionary. Their changed circumstances may
not prevent them from ever again support-
ing the cause of the class from which they
have emerged : on the other hand, rich men
are not often in keen sympathy with the
ideals of the poor, and least of all newly-
enriched men who have known poverty them-
selves. If it were only an even-money
chance that each dangerous democrat, as he
forced his way up from the ranks of the pro-
letariat, could be bought for capitalism at
the cost of a few thousand pounds, then un-
questionably it would be good business for
the capitalists to risk their money on the
venture. But on all past form it is odds on
the capitalists in this respect, which means
that the poor may only enjoy a brief loan of
their best men. The unorganised are thus
hit from every angle by the organised classes’
—in their pockets, in their jobs, and finally
in their champions or defenders, who may be
actually transformed by the tyranny of hard
cash into their assailants. No wonder they
angrily yell the catch-cry of the day, with
no very clear idea of what it signifies.
* * * *
The tragedy is that they should be backing
such a certain loser. None of the innumer-
able patent lightning cures of the past for
social disorders has succeeded —politics bear-
ing a resemblance in this respect to medicine
and finance—and least of all sovietism in
the sense of communism. It is an odd cir-
cumstance that this doctrine should be advo-
cated most strenuously nowadays by some of
those who deny Christianity most loudly;
* s the Church doctrine
or the h all of ]\lan which the clergy are just
beginning to openly reject. The 'theorv of
the I all presupposes a world in which there
was no wickedness. Virtuous communism
vanished and the capitalist era, with its wars
hatreds and oppressions, began at a definite
moment, when the human race first sinned •
and the whole energies of the Early Fathers
were directed to the task which Lenin and
Trotsky set themselves when their revolu-
tion was younger. In monasteries and other
associations of the sort the Early Christians
more or less succeeded in attaining the
allegedly lost conditions of brotherhood and
peace. But as the centuries passed and human,
nature continued to assert itself, the church-
men of the different nations, who were by
then the nation’s statesmen as well, had to
adapt earthly facts to spiritual theories. In-
stead of aiming at the unattainable in the
social sphere, they agreed, at about the time
the quests for the Holy Grail, the philo-
sopher’s stone and so forth were abandoned,
to accept the world for what it was and
make the best of it. The mediaeval successors
of the devotees who in the purlieus of Rome
had furtively proclaimed all men equal in
the sight of the Lord and slavery an iniquity,
graded Society with elaborate care, putting-
each unit, from king down to serf or wage-
earner, in his proper station and citing the
Bible in support. The world is all wrong,
as of old, but that communism isn’t the
cure so long as men continue to be born un-
equal in talents, energy, strength and every-
thing else is painfully evident. The “We
Want Soviets!” cry might as well be altered
to “Back to the Catacombs!” for the cata-
comb existence of the Early Christians is
the essentially artificial and transient one
that sovietism implies.
WHERE THE WHOLE IS LESS THAN
THE PART.
It begins to appear that State ownership of
industries is more abhorrent than private
ownership to the new school of Labor
leaders. It is the school which grew up
during un war, when the good Australians
were away defending the world’s civilisation
while the bad ones and their alien friends
stayed behind, for lack of a compulsory ser-
vice law, to seize the political machinery
and plan treason in general. Certainly
State ownership is having a poor time. In
DID there were still 3010 miles of private
railway in Australia, but nobody hears much
of its troubles, while those of the Govern-
ment lines are never-ending. The N. S.
Wales system was held up in 1917. The
Westralian system was held up last week. The
Queensland system is either held up or due
for a hold-up, though the present Govern-’
ment has appointed a multitude of new
employees ot the right political color to
make the work easier, and has divided prac-
tically all the receipts, including the in-
creased charges, among the workers in
enlarged wages, so that they get practically
the full product of their toil a.s per the
Labor programme, interest on cost being
met out of taxation. The Queensland rail-
ways even paid in 1919 the wages which
the men on the northern line lost while on
strike two years earlier. In . this respect
they set Up a precedent, lor if strikers are
paid while on self-granted holiday, the last
inducement to remain at work disappears.
On the Last-West Federal railway strikes
have been a matter of course, though the
employees receive all the product of their
toil and a little more, the entire interest
bill and part of the working expenses being
charged to taxes. Victoria, which ranks
third as a coal-producing State, is the only
one in which coal-getting is almost exclu-
sively a State business, and since it became
so Victoria’s luck with its fuel supply has
been worse than ever. It was in the middle
ot an attempt to greatly enlarge public
enterprise in this line that there arose a
trouble at first no larger than a man’s
band, which spread presently to railways
and ships, and then threatened to become
general. The reason of this sudden and
violent apostasy from the cult of public
ownership is simple enough. A small, viru-
lent group conceived the idea that industries
which are profitable, or are useful means of
extortion and so could be made profitable,
should be seized and monopolised by a few
hefty piofiteers the men actually employed
in them at the moment—who would become
an hereditary aristocracy, admitting their
sons to their union and to a share in the
business, and disqualifying outsiders. The
new demand of “the mines for the miners”
is raised at Newcastle, which yields coal,
instead of being raised, just as legitimately,
at .Bendigo, which digs up gold, or Clon-
curry, which produces copper, because it
would mean control by a clique of five-
sixths of the country’s supply of an
article for which, it being indispensable, the
country could be forced to pay such prices
that any industrious miner could draw £3OOO
or £5OOO a year. Nationalisation in a
h ederal sense would divide the property
among 5,000,000 shareholders, and in a
State sense among 2,000,000. The theory
of “the mines for the miners” would divide
it among less than 20,000. That is to say,
the handful of non-working union or politi-
cal bosses would take a good deal of the
profit and leave the 20,000 the rest
*** ' «
Lven at the back of the Westralian rail-
way strike there was a vague idea of the
railway-men owning the system. At any
rate it was calmly suggested on their
behalf that the property which now belongs
(save for the bondholder) to 340.000 people
should be handed over to 6600. That num-
ber of persons, using the lines mainly to
extort money, would probably grow very rich
on their monopoly unless they went the way
of most insurrectionary fools. Then the
idea might develop of the banks for the
bank clerks; the insurance offices for the
insurance clerks; the post and telegraphs for
the postal and telegraph employees—in fact
there might be a seizure by small groups of
everything that promised to pay, and the
nationalisation of nothing save husks and
debts. Naturally while the scheme is in-
cubating the conspirators see no good in
public enterprise, arid struggle hard to brin°-
it into disrepute.
* * * *
It is not to be supposed that if the coal-
miners had the mines and the railwaymen
the railways they would be any better off
unless they used their power for purposes
of ferocious extortion. At the old prices
they would be much worse off. The coal-
owners of England are a notorious lot, yet
it was proved on close inquiry that out of
325. lid., then the price of a ton of coal,
the actual grimy miner got 245. 3d. Timber
stores, management, selling costs, etc., ate
up ss. lid., and it is quite probable that
the. miners, if they had taken the work into
their own hands, couldn’t have done it for
twice the money. The owners got 2s. 9d.,
partly for being owners and partly for find-
ing tne money to start the mines and to start
new ones when the old ones wear out. The
miners (as owners), raising money them-
selves out of their linaucial inexperience to
start new mines when wanted, would pro-
bably have found it cost a great deal more
than 2s. 9d.,. though some of the owners,
there being few of them, grow sinfully rich
on that trifle. Probably, the whole being
often less than the part, the policy of “the
mines for the miners’' would leave the miners
with 14s. 3d., gradually diminishing to 4s.
3d., instead of 245. 3d.—that is, unless they
used their monopoly to double prices, in
which case the community might get wild
and declare them outlaws to be shot at
sight. Lane’s New Australians, working
on day labor and equal pay and each man
pale with fear lest he was doing more than
his share, earned about £7 each in a whole
year above the barest living costs, and
earned less than nothing (in fact, they
lost their capital) afterwards. Yet they
started with much money brought from Aus-
tralia, and a rich land endowment, and the
mines were for the miners and the soil for
the laborers and everything for everybody.
Lenin, before his great disillusionment, be-
lieved in the same policy. Off-handedly and
by decree (everything was and is really “by
decree”) he told the operatives almost on
his first day of usurpation: “The factories
are yours. It is for you to enter and take
possession.” Then the works really were
for the workers, and after 10 months of
job control fully 75 per cent, of the output
ceased through incapacity, ' go-slow and
inanition. Unlike Lane’s followers, Lenin’s
people couldn’t write to a fairy godmother
in the shape of an old-fashioned Govern-
ment in Queensland for money to take them
home. They were home. So, having got
the entire produce of their labor, and the
new whole having become only one-fourth of
the- old part, the dictator did the only
thing he could do without going out of busi-
ness. He rushed to the other extreme, and
furiously enslaved the people and set them
to work long, hard, compulsory hours in
order to make a crust for the present and to
catch up arrears of crust if possible. The
results of tremendous toil are poor and
clumsy, for Lenin is probably as bad an
industrial manager as ex-parson Garden, of
Sydney, would be; and even the repudia-
tion of the public debt didn’t provide any
visible wealth. So the Russian mines aren’t
for the Russian miners any longer. Still
the system had a trial. The results would
probably have been worse if Lenin’s system
of slavery hadn’t saved the wheels from,
absolute stoppage.
* * * *
They paint a drab future for Australia,
these men who oppose private and State and
Federal enterprise indiscriminately. These
are some of its features:—
The last vestiges of the system of piecework or
payment by results, which still survives in the shear-
ing and coal-mining and a few other industries, are
to be weeded out if possible. It may not be quite
possible to put the man who writes books or keeps
a shop or runs a two-up school on day wages, but
as regards the manual workers there are great
hopes.
So they will be all on a dead level as if a war
tank had rolled over.them, with no incentive to do
more than the minimum of work, or to do extra
good work, or to learn how to do extra good work.
Each will watch the other for fear he isn’t loafing as
much as the next fellow. Thus no one will rise
above the ruck by being an expert artisan.
And no one will rise above the ruck by becoming
an employer, for there will be none.
And no one will rise to greatness by politics, be-
cause politics will be measured out, like skilly on a
workhouse plate in Oliver Twist’s day, by the
caucus, the Labor Council, the annual Convention,
the A.L.P. Executive and the like. If Julius
CvEsar and Joel Moses Gabb went into Parliament
together on the Labor ticket the only difference
would be that C.-esar would be expelled sooner than
Gabb for having a masterful air of ability about him.
And there won’t be much room in the public ser-
vice, for even a railway manager will have a com-
mittee of employees-—clerks, porters, shunters, etc.
—to “assist” him, and he will be only chief office-
boy.
In fact, for the man who hasn’t put away
ambition, as the debris of Wolsey told Cromwell
to do, the best chance to tower will probably be as
an “organiser,” which is already the surest road
to prominence among the Coming People. Even the
army track will be blocked by the abolition of
“militarism,”
There may still be money to be made— John
storey is making £2445 per annum and
may yet raise his own wage to £5OOO.
But there are some soaring folk who would
rather do big things and die poor than be
as rich'as Crcesus and McGirk combined
and vegetate in their souls.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Friends of Liberty.
A pamphlet to hand from the U.S.A. sup-
ports the suspicion that Australia’s periodi-
cal shipping strikes are, in part at least, of
foreign origin. The document is ad-
dressed to “ ’Longshoremen, marine firemen,
oilers and water-tenders of the Atlantic
Coast and vicinity,” and purports to have
been printed by one Connolly for the
Trade Council of New York. Reduced to
essentials, it reads thus:—
England, the common enemy, is dirty. England
is the enemy of Liberty. England is the enemy of
Labor. She must be forced to her knees by attack-
ing the source of her power, by destroying the artery
that is her very life —her ships. Hang them up in
every port in the world!
Stand clear, every mother’s son of you. Let Brit-
ish ships rot! Work any ship but a Britisher. The
French, the Italians and the friends of Liberty ' in
Australia are doing it. German labor has refused
to handle England’s ships at Hamburg.
Now’s your chance. Up America! Up Ireland!
Down British tyranny!
It is a delectable production, but betrays
some confusion of thought. The “friends
of Liberty in Australia” don’t hold up
British ships to any extent. Unquestionably
they would like to, but beyond an occa-
sional waterside wrangle (and even this is
getting risky, owing to the increasing dis-
inclination of the wharf-lumpers to impoverish
themselves for the “friends of Liberty”), it
is not in their power. The ships that are
hung up—and it happens, on some pretext


or other, every few months —are Australian
ships. British steamers come and go ; it is
Australian steamers that rock idly in the
harbors and rot. For the malignant pur-
poses of the “friends of Liberty” the British
and Australian registers are one. Yet
Australia is nowise responsible for the
grievance of Ireland against England. In
the past she has given weighty moral and
material support to the cause of Irish
nationalism. It is a rotten return for acts
of generosity extending over many years to
be violently dragged into the dreary struggle
and made to suffer in pocket and reputation.
To be told by the agents of Irish nationalism
that the strikes which are gravely damaging
Australian trade and strangling the Aus-
tralian mercantile marine are part of a
world-wide Sinn Fein campaign against
England, and ought therefore to arouse
enthusiasm, is adding insult to injury. The
Kalgoorlie election showed that the average
Australian was getting tired of the Irish
question, and of the overbearing persons
wbQ trade on the Irish question. The inci-
dent under notice is calculated to increase
this weariness. And there are unmistakable
signs that Uncle Sam is getting fed up,
too.
The Latest Irish Immigrant.
The row over the exclusion of young
Osmond Esmonde, son of the Irish baronet
who came here Home Ruling 30 years ago,
draws attention to a discreditable feature
of Australia’s War Precautions Act Repeal
Act—a provision cribbed from the English
Test Act of 1073. The idea of the , Test
Act was to keep undesirables —meaning
Roman Catholics and Protestant Noncon-
formists —out of public offices, just as the
idea of Hughes’s measure is to keep un-
desirables, meaning chiefly Sinn Feiners, out
of Australia. What naturally happened in
17th-century England was that only the best
were excluded: those whose elastic con-
sciences allowed them to take the oath of
allegiance with their tongues in their cheeks
did all the better by reason of the lessened
competition of their moral superiors, though
the public service didn’t. No Sinn Feiner
who meant business in the revolutionary
sense would be checked for two minutes by
the watery affirmation in the Hughes Act.
Burglars don’t worry about window-panes.
But the provision might very well serve as
a check on law-abiding Irish, separatists or
English republicans who are as harmless as
rabbits, and who are not forbidden either
to hold or to express their opinions by the
Common Law of England. But Hughes
has an obsession on the subject of power;
and partly for that reason and partly be-
cause he saw in it a possible means of
advancing his political interests, he substi-
tuted for the War Precautions Act a mea-
sure which is in many respects more out-
rageous. That he was justified in thinking
that he could use such a measure for his
advancement is plain enough now; for it
is clear that every little incident of the
Esmonde sort helps to solidify the racial
and sectarian vote for which he is angling.
On the other side are those who are
making use of Irish patriotism to
advance their Australian political in-
terests. The good Australian can have
not so much as a grain of sympathy with
either of them. Australia has vast problems
of its own, which demand all its attention;
and to divert any of it from those problems
is the work of the enemy of this country.
More than that, the man on either side who,
as happened at Kalgoorlie the other day,
tries to get a decision in an Australian elec-
tion on an issue which cannot possibly be
decided by an Australian Parliament is an
enemy of Democratic Government. For the
real Australian there is only one attitude;
implacable hostility towards every movement
designed to split Australia on non-Australian
issues, implacable hostility towards every
person who takes part in such a movement.
Incidentally—though this paper is very little
concerned about that—the real Irish patriot
surely has nothing to gain by allowing Ire-
land to be used as a catspaw. Yet that is
obviously the only use many alleged Irish
patriots in Australia have for Ireland.

The Man Who Saved the Wheat.
A 55-million-bushel wheat harvest and a
17.8-bushel average are expected by , the
N. S. Wales Government Statistician. There
is no reason to question his estimate, but
considering the recent jeremiads of Agricul-
tural Minister Dunn and other prophets of
gloom, it is not a little astonishing, and loud
bursts of exultation have proceeded from
the Sydney daily press. But amidst the
riot of rapture and the fanfaronade of flap-
doodle no one thought to give any credit
to the man who made the 55-million-bushel
harvest possible. Not having been a cricketer
or a footballer, a bruiser or a tennis-johnnie,
he lived and died unknown to the mass of
his fellow-countrymen. He never shouted
the odds at Randwick, nor did he ride the
winner of the Saddlesitters’ Cup. He was
simply an obscure person named Farber—
the Hugh Mahons and Tom Walshes of
the community would scornfully class him
as a “pommy Englishman”—who labored for
20 years at exhausting, unadvertised and
ill-requited toil. But when the great storm
swept over N. S. Wales last month it was
Farrer’s wheats that saved the situation.
Another crop failure would have spelt utter
disaster to 10,000 farmers. And in former
days the like of the December deluge would
have wrecked the harvest. But in the
obscurity of his experimental patches Farber
bred wheats hardier and of better milling
quality than the soft-grained, easily-shelled
varieties that were universally favored before
he came. One result of his researches was
to greatly extend the area of wheat cultiva-
tion in the Commonwealth; another to
enhance the reputation and increase the value
of Australian flour. And although the man
has been dead for 14 years the preservation
of the present N. S. Wales harvest is part
of the fruits of his work. Most of the
wheat sown last year was Farrer wheat,
and when the rain came down on the land
this wheat was hardly damaged at all. What
did the business was the increased powers
of resistance which, as the result of hun-
dreds of pew crosses and thousands of new
strains, he had imparted to the plants. In
the very presence of disaster the toughened
o-rain and stiffened straw that were his con-
tribution to his adopted country’s wealth
stood up against the wind and rain, and the
haSest ™ saved. By the mrt™s »f »
obscure scientist, thousands of funnels,
drought-smitten for two years, were plucked
from irretrievable ruin, and the equivalent
of at least ten million pounds was preserved
to the State. It ought to be a lasting lesson
to a thoughtless nation. What Farrer .did
for the Australian wheat-grower without
much fame and with precious little reward
could assuredly be done in other industries
if scientists were encouraged according to
their deserts. But Australia hasn t much
use for the application of science to indus-
try unless it is the industry of smiting a
leather ball or knocking a man insensible
with a padded fist. There are few scientists
in the Government services, and then
salaries are such as a coalheaver would
scorn. It was stated m evidence the other
dav that there are only nine _ Government
entomologists in Australia nine men to
cone with the insect pests of an entire con-
tinent—and the maggot-fly alone does
£2 000,000 worth of damage in a year. And
it’goes without saying that relatively- to
politicians and manure-lumpers the nine are
miserably paid. They would be far better
off,, in fact, if they were pugilists.

Transcontinental Railway Lies.
IN the Northern Territory, for want of a
straight line to a sane city, an incoherent sort
of local authority rules. It runs on Bolshevik
or stop-work or 0.8. U. or any old rules or
on the spur of the moment. It is depopulating
the place fast, and 'accelerating that general
retreat from the Bolshevik-cursed North
which is beguiling the wmrid into the belief
that the white Australian can’t make use of
the tropics, that White Australia is a fail-
ure and that the top third of this continent
is due for nigger appropriation. For the last
financial year the N.T. revenue, never large,
was only about two-thirds that of the year
before, and but 4s. in the £ of the ex-
penditure. The rest of the States pay the
other 165., and while they do so the North
won’t work because the Soviet which chases
Governments off the premises won’t let it
work. The Territory is being emptied of
people by the same policy which has deprived
Betrograd of three-fourths of its population.
It is dying because its one huge industry
(meat) and most of its smaller industries
have been stopped, just as the same crowd,
enabled to usurp authority by tiie same
accident of isolation, stopped mining work at
Broken Hill. The latest trouble at Darwin
the City of Blasted Hopes, is grotesque but
not unique. The Australian Workers’ Union
potentates ordered a full member of the
Engineers’ Union to join their show. When
he refused the wharf-laborers, very largely
truculent aliens, demanded his dismissal, and
an official representing the pathetic shadow
of authority caved in. Then the Engineers
demanded, very logically, the reinstatement
of their member, the orthodox alternative
being the stoppage of the railway service,
and the abject skeleton of authority didn’t
know what to do. The Adelaide-Port
Augusta-Darwin railway is not only wanted
because it w r as a condition on which the
Territory was handed over and because it
represents the only chance of turning to pro-
fitable account 240,000 square miles of really
well-watered land that is the Commonwealth’s
own. It is wanted most urgently to save the
North from dissolving into anarchy and be-
coming a nigger Ireland, only worse. A
change which would bring the chronic and
largely alien insurrectionists of Darwin
within about four days’ run of a sane
and level-headed city and within the same
distance of military and police reinforce-
ments and (when the law consequently
grew more speedy and reliable) within
four minutes of a gaol might be the
beginning of resurrection. Failing that there
must soon be almost complete abandonment.
Meantime a library of lies is gathering round
the railway question, the main idea being to
divert the line through Queensland, or else to
abandon the South Australian end altogether
and convert the northern one into a semi-
coastal line joining up with Brisbane and
Sydney. One-half of the motive is a mon-
strous grab by which the Commonwealth is
to spend the money of all the States in build-
ing a road through some of the driest parts
of Queensland instead of sticking to the
development of the country which belongs
to all the States. The other half aims at
strengthening the Bolshevik hold on the
already hag-ridden Territory by connecting it
directly with Cloncurry, where Paul Free-
man and his friends used to hang out; with
Hughenden, where .returned Australian
soldiers were greeted with curses and
assault; with Townsville, where the pro-Hun
riots were; and with Brisbane, the head-
quarters of Theodore and Fihelly. In
fact, the fight is to annex the North to the
most instead of to the least anti-Australian
section of the continent. All the argument
about the necessity for Australia to turn
traitor over its agreement re the Port
Augusta-Darwin line in order to economise
distances is based on blank falsehood. The
position is this: —
The transcontinental line to which the Common-
wealth is pledged would bring two capitals (Perth
and Adelaide) closer to Darwin, and consequently
to Asia and Europe, than the Queensland deviation.
It would leave two others (Melbourne and Hobart)
at about the same distance.
It isn’t certain whether it would make the Darwin-
Sydney journey a few miles longer than the deviation
or leave things much the same. All depends on the
track of the deviation. The Darwin-Sydney route
wouldn’t be round by Adelaide and Melbourne as
the perjurers allege, but over the new line which
N. S. Wales is pushing out towards Broken Hill. If
the Europe-Asia trade came to Sydney that way it
might save a very hopeless-looking work from blank
ruin.
Brisbane wouldn’t save so very many miles, but
it would be saved the cost of pushing out a line or
two to meet the transcontinental by the transcon-
tinental coming to it. It would grab the new land
values with both hands while the Commonwealth
paid. And it would grab the Territory’s soul.
If there were half as many members for Aus-
tralia in this country as there are members
for Ireland the transcontinental line would
be raced ahead, for the future of the v> hite
Policy depends on it.
Six Shillings a Week in Woolloomooloo.
Various little philanthropists of the troubled
Ma State are buzzing like a capsized bee-
hive with demands that Parliament —which
meant to take 6| months off to spend its
new salary—shall meet again promptly in
order to pass the Child Endowment Bill.
The shadow of this measure, which is to
provide a weekly allowance for every child
from the second onwmrds unless the parents
are very affluent, grows bigger day by day.
The Mayor of Sydney, who is also a boss
man in political Labor circles, touched the
summit recently when he estimated the bill
at £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 a year; but bills
are so remarkable that it is possible he may
be correct. That would mean making Jhe
State taxes between and 3 times heavier
than in the year which ended in June,
1919; and as both State and Federal taxes
are growing, quite apart from this new de-
mand, the situation is unusual. There is
no available record of any country haying
its taxes raised 250 per cent, all at once in
peace time. Yet even though the endow-
ment is realised at such a cost it won’t make
a single slum in Woolloomooloo or Waterloo
or Surry Hills —the places “where every
girl has the right to be a mother” —less
immoral, unhealthy or indecent. The sordid-
ness of the 6 x 12 back-yard life arises from
the systematic crowding of nearly a million
people into one city, though country towns
be emptied to do it, so that in the struggle
to live near to places of employment even
the five-guinea-per-week flat-dweller leads
the slum life, only with a little extra gilding.
No city, however rich, from the Glasgow and
Sydney size upwards, has managed to avoid
slums, though Sydney’s case is aggravated
by its contour and by the lack of tube rail-
ways (which it can’t pay for), and is made
more vile by the fact that it isn’t densely
peopled because the country is full,
but represents one of the premeditated
iniquities of the world. But not one
shoddy philanthropist of the motherhood
crowd gives awy real support to schemes
for making new cities at other ports, with
railways leading inland from them to bring
trade. There are all manner of features
about the child-pauper idea, but the most
notable lies in this fact that all the Maw-
worms and Tartuffes and Ciiadbands and
sundries lament periodically about the misery
of breathless Woolloomooloo and such places,
and then offer the parents of the small deni-
zen 6s. per week instead of securing for the
small denizen himself fresh air and a new
environment.

The Floors of Civilisation.
Exactly what may happen when civilised
man drops through because the bottom falls
utterly out of his civilisation it is hard to
say. There are samples of lost people in
Central Asia and elsewhere, but their
descent was protracted, and we don’t know
exactly what height they descended from, any
more than we know, by looking at a monkey,
how tall a tree he once lived in. There
are intelligent-looking—even brilliant-looking
—fossils underground, but we don’t know
exactly where they dropped to, though they
seem to have missed Christian burial. It
isn’t sufficient to say that a once high-grade
community may fall to the level of the savage,
for the savage—medium or low —at least has
a definite level, while the dropper has to
look for one, and if the place underneath is
really, bottomless he has far to go. Even
the very ordinary barbarian has law, cus-
toms and traditions to give him a certain
stability, while the community which has
shed these things has either to find new
ones or go on its unballasted way towards
the unknown. It is certain that the man
who slides\ out of a 20-storey window falls
to the base and sordid level of the man on
the tenth storey, but he doesn’t stop there —
he whizzes past. Petrograd was formerly
the greatest city of Russia, but the Bolshevik
Government transferred the capital back to
old Moscow and made that the place where
some show of order and even prosperity is
kept up to impress strangers, so Petrograd
had to be content as an ordinary self-support-
ing specimen of Bolshevik city life. All ac-
counts represent it as the sample of civilisa-
tion that is whizzing past. It took Babylon
and Bokhara and Samarcand so many cen-
turies to lose themselves that nobody lived to
see the whole process, 'but Petrograd has
done it all in three years of peace (peace
in the sense that no foreign enemy has
been there), so the whole process is visible.
Three-fourths of the people are dead or
vanished. The survivors are in the main drop-
sical skeletons —skeletons for lack of food
and dropsical or flabby or bubbly through
drinking immense quantities of water to
keep the stomach distended. Nobody has
much strength to work, and morals have
slid through a hole into the abyss. In un-
clean hospitals, to which patients bring their
own bedding and generally have it stolen,
the doctors, mostly ex-medical students
whose training was interrupted, give a sort
of attention and operate with out-of-date
instruments and often without anaesthetics,,
for the supply is short. Drains, water-pipes
and sanitary appliances have passed out of
repair. People move into houses casually,
for there are plenty of empties to choose
from, and a house is mostly anybody’s
house. They stay till they have used up
the woodwork for fuel, and then move on,
leaving additional stench behind them. The
combustible parts of the great city, including
the wood-blocks of the streets, are all going
the way of fuel. Literature and education
have disappeared, partly because the food-
struggle keeps everyone busy, and partly
because literature is fuel. The position
seems to be that the ruler who governs
neither by hereditary right, divine right nor
legitimate election, needs to be, in some way
or in several ways, the biggest man in the
State. If he is born that way it is good
for the State. If he isn’t great as a soldier,
statesman, organiser of industry, or even
prophet, then, whether he is Trotsky or
Tom Walsh or Lenin or Garden, the
better people have to die or disappear so
that he can be great. In Russia’s case the
better people were disfranchised and de-
prived of all share in the government. Then
they began to vanish, partly because it
seemed best to kill them lest they should
object to being disfranchised, partly because
being helots they didn’t matter, and largely
because, being non-voters and despised, they
got the least rations. It takes a lot of
wiping out of the intelligent class, who
really represent the biggest part of a
nation’s productive power, to make a low
type of tyrant the best man in the com-
munity. Petrograd, as a centre of intelli-
gence, naturally suffered most. It raises a
thrilling question as to how far civilised man
can drop, and what kind of floor he may land
on when he finishes dropping, or if there is
any floor to finish on or any finish.

The Sawbones Trade.
Two out of 50 or more contributions on tee
other side. The first is by a N. S. Wales
medical student:—
“Macquarie Street’-’ (B. 6/l/’2l) wants the stan-
dard raised in order to limit the output. What sort
of a University would it be that fixed its standard
by its attendance-roll ? As a logical sequence, when
students were few, the standard would have to be
low. Already no Uni. in the world has a higher
standard than that of N. S. Wales. There are cer-
tainly 986 medical students (the pre-war number
was between 450 and 500), but the increase over
the normal is mainly due to the large number of
returned men doing the course. In my year alone
there are about 60 of us. If the standard is raised
or the course extended, students who took no part
In the war will have been allowed through on much
easier conditions than those who did their bit.
Half the present N.S.W. medicoes are graduates of
overseas universities. Surely no country can be said
to have a surplus of medical students if it produces
only half its own doctors. The truth is that the
doctors of the Ma State have for years been on a
princely footing. Even to-day it is a poor prac-
titioner who is not making £lOOO a year. In no
other country in the world has Sawbones made
bigger money. Hence the antipathy to the new men.
Incidentally, the Government, which is so good
at appointing Royal Commissions, might nominate
one to inquire why the professors of the Medical
School are getting such poor results from their
students as were evidenced last year. If 600-odd
students, most of whom are exhibitioners or bursars,
cannot produce more than a 45 per cent, pass, there
must be something radically wrong with either their
teachers or their examination standard.
And from a Victorian practitioner:—
“Macquarie Street” (B. 6/l/’2l) makes some
interesting statements, but his lament that unless
something is done a professional debacle is imminent
contains nothing of novelty. I recollect hearing it
15. years ago, when a then leader of the profession
solemnly warned a crowd of students, of whom I was
one, that the old system of examinations was about to
pass away for ever, to be succeeded by a competitive
method of granting degrees only to the first 25
per cent, in order of merit, the rush to enter the
profession having rendered this necessary. At the
same time the air was filled with rumors of the
raising of the matriculation standard in order to
cut down the number aspiring to enter the faculty.
The competitive system in medical examinations has
never been introduced, nor has the matric. been
made more severe. Rather, it has been made easier
for students to enter the University; and even if
examiners have demanded that candidates should
possess greater knowledge than formerly, it has only
been in keeping with the advancement of science.
I see no mystery about the psychology of the rush
to enter law and medicine. In every community
there are a certain proportion of young men to
whom the entering of a profession is a matter of
course. In Australia their choice is restricted to
medicine, law, engineering and their allied callings,
the Church, science and the academic study of
literature. Of these the last is undertaken mostly
with a view to the entry of the student to the ranks
of schoolmasters, an occupation poorly paid and
which contains few plums. Science, as a means of
earning a living, is worse, if anything, for coupled
with low remuneration is a difficulty in finding open-
ings, unless the graduate has had some years of
practical experience in industrial laboratories after
acquiring his degree. As for the Church, none enter
it in this utilitarian age with the object of making
money out of it. Engineering attracts its proportion,
mostly of the mechanically-gifted, but there is not
room for a great many. On the other hand, medicine
and law, because people will always get sick or
engage in litigation, offer at all times the prospect
of making a decent living, with, as an added induce-
ment, prizes of dazzling richness and honor. It is
small wonder, therefore, that these two professions,
together with that of dentistry, absorb 50 or 60
per cent, of those who enter a University in search
of knowledge with which to later make a living.
Nobody with any knowledge of our Universities
would deny that the Faculty of Medicine in any of
them would not be better off were some plan devised
by means of which there could be excluded, not all
save those of exceptional brilliance, but those who
enter upon the study of medicine half-heartedly,
with no special gifts for it and in many cases with
only a half-formed intention to complete the course.
These are the real bane of the Universities- —men
who, having finished the first year, either drop out
and take up some other occupation, or else scramble
through to the end of the second or third year, when
they disappear from sight and are later observed as
bank-clerks, shop-assistants or even tram-drivers. It
is simply that they do not possess the intellectual
requirements for any profession; but while they are
finding this out they are occupying room which
could be put to a better use. The figures for the
students at present attending lectures in medicine
in Melbourne University are highly illustrative.
There are 192 in first year, 88 in second year, 81 in
third year, 77 in fourth year and 58 in fifth year.
Applying this diminishing ratio to those now in
first year, it is likely that about 40 will eventually
be admitted to the degree of M. 8., the rest having
dropped out en route, the majority of their own free
will. Thus “Macquarie Street’s” fears as to the
future of the thousand students at present in the
University of Sydney, where the same rule applies
to a greater extent, are largely groundless.
The principal need of the Universities is the
abolition of the first j'ear of the course, with its
preliminary subjects of chemistry, physics and
biology. By still keeping a five-year course, an
additional j'ear would he gained for hospital work,
while the requirement that a student, before enter-
ing upon the study of medicine, should have com-
pleted first year of the science course in chemistry,
physics and biology, would effectively stop those un-
suited for a medical career from ever beginning one;
for only students in earnest about their work would
emerge from the preliminary science year. Most
American Universities insist on students having com-
pleted at least two years of science, while some
insist on the possession of a degree in science before
the study of medicine can be commenced.
A Profession in Which Brains Don’t

distinguished themselves as civilians. Some,
stripped of the pomp and circumstance of
their commands, stand out as such asses that
the mind reels at the thought of them in con-
trol for years of the destinies of hundreds,
even thousands, of picked human beings.
And many of the best are discovered as no
more than mediocrities. In all the armies
that these dullards led there were plenty
of highly educated and intelligent men who
never got out of the ruck. The world rarely
encounters an uneducated and painfully
futile person leading at the Bar, in medi-
cine or in engineering. But a different
class rises to the top in the sphere where
first-raters are most needed, inasmuch as in
it the issues concern not only property but
human life; and the explanation lies chiefly
in the system. The most obvious absurdity
is promotion by seniority. This was practi-
cally dispensed with in the A.1.P., as re-
gards junior officers, after 19X6; but the
war being over it has come into its own
again, and it is conditioned, of course, not
on war-service but on the other sort of ser-
vice, which is why, in all parts of the
Empire, field-officers with brilliant fighting
records are to be found saluting young men
who never saw r an enemy shell burst. But
even during the few years when the seniority
fetich was partially blanketed the other
abuses continued—the abuses which give
armies the men of whom Philip Gibbs and
others wrote so bitterly. Every man who
went to the war quickly got out of his head
his boyish ideas about the successful soldier
being a sort of Plenty were, of
course; but qualities of chivalry and
unselfishness were positive handicaps to
officers almost everywhere except in the
line. It is notorious that there were
far surer ways of rising than by
courage, blunt honesty and fair dealing. Who
has not met the Perfect Adjutant? He was
originally in some clerical job, or in a shop,
or he had not long left school; anyhow, he
was one to whom the habit of subservience
came easy. No one laughed so heartily at
the Colonel’s bad jokes and old stories;
or listened with such attentive admiration to
braggadocio which grew more and more
blatant with unrebuked indulgence; or
saluted with_ such a convincing air of dog-
like veneration; or agreed more zealously
that black was white or white was black
according to the whim of the Colonel. His
offensiveness to those under him was often
intolerable. A man who has never been in
the position to give orders and have them un-
questioningly obeyed is liable to go on a sort
of autocratic drunk when the opportunity
first arrives to be a Czar. And occasionally
the disease becomes chronic. What the ad-
jutant was doing in orderly-room orderly-
room was doing whenever the chance offered
at division ; and so on up the scale. It is
the Army way. In this profession, nominally
the manliest of all, bravery can be dispensed
with. Prominent generals of every army
were known to lack it. Brains did not
matter. Five minutes’ talk with many a Well-
known general would demonstrate that. But
a supple knee and a gift for intrigue—those
were most valuable assets. They should be
as worthless in the Army as they are at the
Bar or in architecture or dentistry. Until
they can be eradicated as factors making for
advancement, militarism will be distrusted,
and by none so much as those who have
watched it in operation. The best possible
advertisement that the rank and file of the
A.I.F. could wish for lies in some of the
men under whom they won battles: just as
these potentates are the worst possible ad-
vertisement of the system which permitted
them to rise.
The Protest of an Embittered Scot,
“,T.E.” writes in the above capacity:—
I am moved to write this by perusal of that last
straw which breaks the camel’s back.
Oil one of the last days of the old year Heavy
Father T. J. 0 Donnell spoke a piece at Paddington,
Sydney. Ireland loomed up large of course—
that vernal eternal isle from which there is no
refuge except in the grave. But that was nothing.
What counts is the following:
r “ T ° Uching upon Germany’s present position, Father
O Donnell said the Germans were magnificent
people. (Applause).... It would be a good thing
to bring 2.000,000 Germans to this country....
The Australian republic was sure to come, and
when it did he would hail it with delight.”
And the republic that came would promptly go
again, like a ship passing in the night. When Aus-
tralia had shaken off the alliance and protection of
the rather patronising and supercilious though fairly
effective Old Man in London, it would doubtless be
the business of that solid block of 2,000,000 trained
Lutheran Prussians, aided by those who are here
already and their allies, to waft us into the haven
of the German republic or empire or whatever it
is. To break with England largely on account of
Ireland, our worst enemy’s friend, and commit
suicide on the Junker’s ample bosom, would be
too wonderful. Give me a less complicated death
with less bathos in it.
Let me put the situation historically. Scotland
and Ireland came into the Union on similar terms.
That is to say they acquired the disadvantage of
being mostly governed by England and the advantage
of helping to govern England and Wales and to
govern and profit by the English Empire overseas if
they knew how, for neither of them had any empire
of its own overseas. Ireland had never tried for
one, and Scotland’s efforts, especially at Darien, had
failed. In each case the local Parliament voted
its own destruction under dubious cash circum-
stances. Both countries remembered Cromwell and
disliked him.
They were divided countries. Belfast and Cork
were different in race and religion to a very great
extent. Mid-Lothian and Sutherland were more
divided —by religion, for the north of Scotland re-
mained largely Catholic, though emigration has
since made the R.C. element less conspicuous; by
language, traditions and clothes. The Catholic dis-
abilities struck all countries in the partnership—even
the Dukes of Norfolk, leading peers of England, were
shut out of the House of Lords for over a century.
Ihe north of Scotland had fought the south right
down to 1746. It was only half Scotland that
put up the long scrap with England. The other
half chewed it from behind.
When religious disabilities were removed (an
Irishman being the first Roman Catholic welcomed to
the Commons for 140 years) the British Parliament
consisted of 471 members from England, 105 from
Ireland, 53 from Scotland, 29 from Wales. When
the Irish later formed their National party it num-
bered 85, so the real Ireland had a bigger vote than
ever Scotland possessed. Still, Scotland went on the
simple principle of taking over and governing Eng-
land. It supplied many Prime Ministers, considering
the smallness of its voting power—inside 55 years
there were Aberdeen, Gladstone (who said there
THE MINSTREL.
wasn’t one drop of blood in Lis veins that wasn’t
Scotch), Rosebery, Balfour and Campbell Ban-
ner man, and there is Bonar Law in the offing.
Even Wales supplied one, the strenuous Lloyd
George. Ireland supplied only its petted, potted
grievance.
Now Ireland, the land of wasted opportunities, has
every right to run its business as it pleases on its
own ground. It has a right to absolute political free-
dom if it feels that way. But when an Irish R.C.
cleric, full of Ireland’s troubles, proposes that Aus-
tralia should fill up with 2,000,000 Huns, then
disclaim British protection and take its chance to
be eaten up by the Protestant savages who desolated
Belgium, it is over the odds. It seems to me un-
christian hatred raised to the nth degree and blazing
ingratitude for hospitality received. Australia has
probably supplied more good billets for Irish clerics
than any other country save their own. It gave (in
N. S. Wales) men of Irish descent the first chance
they ever had to be a ruling majority in a responsible
Government, and the vagaries of men like McTiernan
and Loughlin have been an awakening and have put
back the clock in the matter of sympathy with Ire-
land a good many years. That is saying nothing
of the Queensland records of Ryan, Fihelly, McCor-
mack and Edward Granville Theodore. Australia,
it seems to me, doesn’t want to be butchered to make
an Irish holiday. Ireland isn't big enough to be
worth it.
Australia’s separation from the Empire wouldn’t
deprive the Empire of a country that is bound to
supply it with tribute, military or naval aid, com-
mercial -advantages or even obedience save in an
infinitesimal way. So the damage to England would
be nil —unless the loss of British support enabled
some hostile and non-Australian people (Irish, Huns
or others) to seize Australia and squash its liberties
and use it by compulsion as a weapon against the
Old Man in London. Considering the mixed names
and nationalities of the loudest republicans of the
new school, why exactly do they want British
military and naval support cut off?
There are people so constituted that they would
go 10 miles out of their road to do an injury to
their best friends. However, I mention no names.
From an Australian who is trying to help
this country (and especially this country’s
repatriated Diggers) in England :
It is all so disheartening. I will give you my
yesterday’s experience. A big shipment of tinned
pineapples lately arrived—at an unfortunate time,
for there is a market glut at the moment. I under-
took to give a hand in trying to sell it. By a bit
of good luck I got an appointment with Mr. Orbell.
He is the head of the buying for Lyons’s, and that
was a big thing—they own the Trocadero, the Regent
Palace and hundreds of restaurants. He is a fine
man, and would help to push Australian produce,
but he wanted me to realise what I was up against.
So we spent a couple of hours in the big laboratory
and amongst samples of tinned fruit and jams from
every part of the world. I had my sample tin of
pineapples which I had not opened, as I wanted to
do it in his presence. I felt very confident about
these goods. The get-up was all right, and the
outside appearance attractive. The tin was part
of the first consignment from the Government
nery which had been built for the repatriated sol-
diers at a cost, we are told, of over £40,000. It
was labelled 21b. nett. Well, we opened it, and at
once saw that the packing was all wrong. Very
small pine had been used, certainly all one size,
but the tin was too large for the fruit, so they
had packed pieces around the sides. It looked
slovenly. All my talk went for nothing, of course.
The expert’s report was “Bruised, broken, uneven;
nine pieces ripe and nice color, five pieces white,
not ripe enough; one a mere shaving; one broken.
The fruit without the liquid weighed lib. 3£oz.,
worth from 14s. 6d. to 15s. to-day’s price.” The
cost landed was 225. per doz. Mr. Orbell took
a tin from a consignment from the Pratt Low Pre-
serving Co., of California, opened it and it was a
perfect joy to look at. The tin was the right size,
and the golden juicy slices were perfect in every
way. Then, though claiming less weight, it actually
weighed lib. 60z., or 3oz. more than ours. It is
heartbreaking, especially when you know the excel-
lence of our fruit. Then we turned to the peaches.
He took at random a tin of Sydney packing, opened
it and put beside it one from the Pacific Preserving
Co., California. It was a humiliating experience.
I send a copy of the report to show how far our
people have to go before they can hope to compete
with others who mix brains with their work and
give heed to the requirements of the market.

Randolph Bedford writes:—
“The British connection,” says “Bii.dad” (B.
6/l/’2l), “is the only certain thing that stands
between the Walshes and the Considines” and
others taking turns at playing Barrios and Santa
Ana —“direct aetionists who ran republics with
great violence and profited thereby.” Barrios and
Santa Ana and others did not have the institution
of adult suffrage and long usage of it to check them.
(By the way, “the British connection” didn’t give
us adult suffrage. Australians won it in the teeth
of opposition that called it “un-British.”) The
British connection gave us some alleged “protec-
tion” until war came along, and then we had to
fight for our lives ourselves—at least, the Conscrip-
tionists said that was what Australia did fight for.
But the “British connection” and the British super-
stition did tie us to Freetrade and left us without
the protection of established industries when war
came along. The “British connection” was weaker
in Canada, and Canada was next door to the power-
ful U.S., so Canada had High Protection and estab-
lished industries, and was thus enabled to make
money out of the war, whereas Australia lost it
by hundreds of millions. “The British connection”
lost the white man’s prestige with the Jap Treaty
—necessary to Britain in the face of the German
menace of 15 years before the war. By putting its
house in order then, Britain could have done with-
out an alliance with colored aliens; but, just as
Britain did nothing to counter the German menace
of 20 years ago (instead of meeting the danger with
a cash payment of reform—reform in tariff and
industrialism), it preferred to pay with a promis-
sory note, which Japan will probably ask Australia
to redeem. It will be no use referring the note to
the maker, because the maker is too far away for
quick settlement when the demand is made. But
for the presence of America in the Pacific Japan
would probably have presented the p.n. ere now.
I am not a Republican barracking in the interest of
the “picturesque adventurers” “Bildad” has imagined
out of his own head; but I am one because I believe
republicanism is the only form of government for
any self-respecting country and because I know that
the “British connection” with Australia is not a
protection but an entanglement that is almost cer-
tainly dangerous. Our only friend in the Pacific is
America, and there is as noisy an anti-American
party in England as there was before and through-
out the war. The continuous closer understanding of
Britain and Japan may be pro-British, but it is
certainly anti-Australian; and the English must
learn tba.t Australia’s national ideal is not to be
prejudiced by huckstering. It wasn’t Britain made
Australia; Australian gold made Australia—calling
all the strong and the daring from the rotten Europe
and Britain of 1849 and onward. It isn’t a question
for heat or bad language, or “Bildad’s” hated
“direct action,” because Australia by a majority of
votes will take complete independence when Australia
decides on doing it. Meantime I don’t want to cut
the painter; it would be a waste of energy and
knives, since the painter is rotting off.
Cancer killed 4421 Australians in 1919.
It was a year of unusually heavy mortality,
owing to the influenza epidemic; neverthe-
less the rodent disease caused 6.71 per cent,
of the total deaths, and among male South
Australians the death-rate was 1 per 1000
the highest yet recorded in the Common-
wealth. Since 1914 it has killed more than
tuberculosis. But Dr. Heiser, of the Rocke-
feller Foundation, brings a message of hope.
‘Over 40 per cent, of cancer cases,” he told
a reporter, “are curable if brought to the
doctor early. If you can educate the people
to go to the doctor when an intractable sore
or hard lump develops you will do away
with a great part of the world’s cancer.”
Incidentally, the American scientist declared
that Australia and Maoriland were “the
healthiest countries in the world,” and the
Foundation’s work in combating hookworm
and malaria shows that tropical Australia
can be made as healthy as the temperate
zone if the people are prepared to pay the
price. Certainly cancer is less common in
the tropics than in the temperate parts.
This is true to some extent' of Australia,
where the inhabitants of the tropical dis-
tricts are recent immigrants, but it applies
in a much greater degree to indigenous tro-
pical populations. In Ceylon, for instance,
the cancer death-rate is 0.09 per 1000 of
mean population, and in Jamaica 0.17 per
1000, as against 1.09 in the Netherlands,
1.10 in Sweden,. 1.15 in the United Kingdom
and 1.28 in Switzerland. These are im-
pressive figures, and it is a pity the Rocke-
feller Foundation doesn’t include cancer in
its field of tropical research. Leprosy is now
being cured by chaulmoogra oil, a prepara-
tion distilled from a Burmese tree, and per-
haps some other tropical plant hides the
secret for which all the world is waiting—-
the specific for this other deadly ill.

The defeat of Mahon brought Frank Tudor
a happier Christmas than he had expected.
The party has been split into camps, Tudor
leading the moderate wing, and Ryan poised
at the head of raw economists and financiers
of the Lazzarini and Cunningham type. It
seems amazing that Ryan would consent to
lead such a troupe, but feeling like a Mexi-
can insurrecto he doesn’t trouble much about
the quality of his army. All the same, the
defeat of Mahon means the loss of a valu-
able lieutenant, and the resignation of Con-
sidine from the A.L.P. leaves him with two
less than the Tudor crowd.
The Westralian railway strikers went
back to work on the terms that were offered
to them before they struck. They gained
nothing by their act but a fortnight’s holi-
day. and that was at their own expense.
Incidentally, the country lost heavily in
decreased production, and doubtless a few
more babies died for lack of the milk that
didn’t arrive from the country; but babies
nowadays are less important than blather-
skites, and the modern industrialist who
yesterday bawled for “nationalisation ”
doesn’t care a dump what happens to the
State.
Admiral Sims, whom Samuel our uncle
sent with a fleet to help in the war, has
written a book. Much of it deals with
familiar matters, but the story of the fleet’s
reception at Queenstown, in the south-west
of Ireland, is fairly new. Sims found that
the hatred of Britain was only limited by
the fact that the inhabitants couldn’t hold
more. Which is merely further evidence
that Lloyd George may negotiate with polite
Irish leaders about a change of views till
Orion slopes to the east instead of the west,
and do it without any good resulting. If
a man is engaged to a girl and finds that
she would associate with a hog for prefer-
ence, and that all her friends and relations
turn sick at the sight of him, it seems best
to drop the subject and get out, especially
when he doesn’t care much for the girl. And
if he is married to her divorce is better than
argument.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Everything is now nicely prepared for the shuffle
of portfolios when Cook (or Hughes) goes to London
as High Commissioner. A while ago Pratten threat-
ened to burst up the arrangements. Considering him-
self obscured in the Senate, he thought that the
possibility of Cook’s early departure offered him an
opportunity to resign from the Senate and enter
the Reps, via Parramatta. But this didn’t suit
Senator Millen’s plans. He also misses the limelight
in the Senate, and in the event of Cook departing
to England he is determined to leap from Joe’s
electorate into the portfolio of Treasurer and have
a trial run as Acting-Priminister. Meantime Pratten
has suddenly discovered new virtues in the Senate,
where the work is lighter and the pay the same.
The other day someone whispered that, should Millen
leave the Senate, there will be a vacant portfolio,
and perhaps Pratten overheard the remark. If
Hughes becomes High Comrrlissioner Millen may have
a shot at Bendigo; but that hasn’t been settled yet.
A misinformed London correspondent says
that an expedition is to be formed to explore
“the south-west coast of Australia” and dis-
cover a tribe of pigmies said to be living
there. The error is one of locality. Our
politicians are not confined to the south-
west coast.
In Ireland they no doubt now call their
neighbor the Smother Country.
Two of this country’s attempted substi-
tutes for plain work and self-reliance have
arrive d—a railway
man from the U.S.
and anothey from
England. They are
here because this
country has managed
to do what no one
else ever did—divide
its f a i 1 w a y system
fairly equally into
three gauges, not to
prevent invasion of
State by State, but
out of sheer cussed-
ness. The pair are
new to the problem,
though our own
neoole are not, and
don’t profess to know
any cheap magic or
m y star y that will
deal with it. They
will presumably sug-
gest the gauges fami-
liar in their own
countries, which is
also the one which
the Federal Govern-
ment has adopted. If
they suggest any
other their proposal
won’t b e accepted,
though it will have
be paid for; and if
they suggest that one
we will be no nearer
having the money to
pay for it. So it is all
silly rot, like the hiring of a Judge to raise
members’ salaries when they were going up
in any case.
One industry that it is a pleasure to meet
at a time when joy is scarce is the Anzac
(Vic.) hand-loom tweed business. The
Repat. disliked it from the first because it
was an upstart and interloper, founded be-
fore the Department existed. At times it
couldn’t even buy sufficient yarn from Gov-
ernment mills. A committee of the Soldiers’
League got hold in the end and threw out
the pomp and ceremony of official interfer-
ence. Now, after 11 months of the new,
management, the output has increased 400
per cent., wages average £8 per week, and
the year ended with a bonus; the debt has
been paid off, and the interest of each man
in the business is estimated already at £2OO.
All efforts to make the co-operative owners
go on strike against themselves have so far
failed, but the Face at the Window still
badly wants to rescue it from the jaws df
the oppressor.
It will hardly be safe for the N. S. AVales
Parliament to come together for six months,
as the Government majority will be touring
at the country’s expense. Hence various ama-
teurish, annoying little tli.ngs that were
done in haste by the 12 Ministers w'ho had
never been in office
before will have to
stay. One is the law
that no one may exe-
cute a transfer or
agreement to transfer
any property unless
the name of. the pur-
chaser is fiPed in in
ink. Hitherto the
man who wanted
money in a hurry
could sign a transfer
of shares, bond war-
rants. etc., with no
purchaser’s name on
it, because there was
none. The institution
which lent the money
could find a buyer and
fill in the name if the
article wasn’t re-
deemed. Now it will
be necessary to find
a n actual buyer,
which may take time,
and make an actual
sale, which the owner
may not want to do,
or else arrange the
business in another
State where the flies
don’t buzz so
violently. The
arrangement does no
good to anybody, any more than the worn-
out proviso about signing names to articles
at Federal election time. It is 'just buzz.
It being absolutely impossible to face the
bill for compensation to publicans, brewers,
etc., if No License should be carried, the
N. Wales Government has decided that
the referendum, which the law says must
be held very shortly, shall not be held. A
bill to repeal the impossible statute could
have been put through before Parliament
adjourned. But the Storey Ministry pre-
fers to ignore the law, or to assume that the
law is different, as it did when it scattered
its £5 bonuses among expectant mothers.
Some day a new Government may arise
which will overhaul these contemptuous trans-
actions and make Ministers personally re-
sponsible to their last shirt-button for their
illegal expenditure. There are quite a lot
of precedents now for retrospective action.
Among the stack of laws passed by the
N.S.W. Government last session hardly one
aims at increased production. The result
is simply a long avenue of new signs with
the Hun word “Verboten” on each. Now
the Legislature goes into a state of hiberna-
tion for six months or more at £845 per
member, and in that long interval the unem-
ployed will have time to accumulate. Like
the winter bear, Parliament will live on its
own fat —£70 per month of fat. The unem-
ployed have no fat. There is not enough to
go round. And the idea of producing more
—which means doing more and harder
work—a Labor Government isn’t game to
mention these days.
The enthusiastic striker who would rather
eat grass than go back to work or arbi-
trate never seems to realise that his mulisli-
ness hurts his own kind most. In Mel-
bourne all trams have been stopped at 7 in
the evening, and there has been but an
hourly service of suburban trains. So the
workers who have sweltered all the mid-
summer day in the city have been debarred
from taking a tram-ride to the beaches for
a breath of fresh evening air. Perforce they
have continued to swelter, while the well-
to-do have tuned up their motors and taken
a run down to St. Kilda, Brighton or Sand-
ringham, where they have had the bayside
resorts practically to themselves. It’s a
mad world, with the union boss its most
insane inhabitant.
If the Leg. Assembly were sitting the Vic.
Ministry would be badgered about two orders
given recently by Lieut.-Governor Irvine, on
the recommendation of Attorney-General
Robinson, for the release of prisoners. The
police have made a noise, and Robinson has
put out a lot of very unsatisfying special
pleading. J. B. Patterson used to say : “Show
me the names of the members of a select com-
mittee and I’ll tell you its finding in ad-
vance.” If he were alive now he might add:
“And give me the name of the pleader put
up to get a prisoner out, and I’ll tip your
chance.”
A question arises whether the N. S. Wales
Government hasn’t in its crude haste made
it needless to stamp receipts provided the
money has been paid in notes, cheques or
drafts. The Act, which nearly broke its neck
vetting through at the last moment, says that
no stamp is required when the receipt is for
‘‘a bill of exchange or p.n. duly stamped. - ’
Another clause says that a bill of exchange
covers, among other things, “any document
or writing entitling or purporting to entitle
any person whether named therein or not to
payment by any other, person of or to draw
HIS REFERENCES.
“There is no one better suited to have charge of
the motherhood endowment scheme —I have five
children of my own,” or words to the same effect.—
N.S. IF. Minister McGirr.
THE APPLICANT: “Of course, I don't know
any foreign languages, and nothing of
accounts, hut I have excellent references
—five children here and five more at
home."
on any other person for any sum of money
therein mentioned.” A cheque is that sort of
writing duly stamped, and a £1 or any other
note is that kind of document or writing
as duly stamped as the law requires.
To add to the muddle another law has
been suspended as unworkable. It said
quite suddenly that articles sold in pac-
kets must, after New Year’s Day, be packed
in certain quantities and no other. But there,
were vast numbers of other packages on hand
which couldn’t well be burned, and probably
hundreds of thousands coming which couldn’t
well be thrown overboard. So the regula-
tions are not to be rigidly enforced for a
while, though they may still be handy against
a political or other opponent.
GIGANTHANASIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Giganthanasia is one ofvthe most important prin-
ciples of paleontology, and teaches that all animals
(with the exception of insects) tend throughout the
ages to grow larger and larger until when they seem
greatest and strongest they disappear.”
The dinosaurus long is sleeping
In hills of stone that once were mud,
The giant kangaroo is keeping
Tryst with the wreck of Noah’s flood ;
All things that grew too big to wallow
In twenty feet of primal slime
The giant ages rose to swallow
And seal within the womb of time.
So great they were they went unfearing
With open jaws and waving tail.
They roared; and all things within hearing
’Turned sick and sad and deadly pale.
And as they chewed the vast creation,
Limb, scale and claw and hide and bone,
Each like a walking railway station
Was marked by nature “Overgrown.”
For this is nature’s law long spoken
In wind and rain and fire and snow:
The thing that grows too big is broken
Just when the ball is at its toe.
Just when its roar is like ten devils
There comes a winding-sheet of sand
That wraps the monster up and levels
Its grave to make a plot of land.
This useful rule that slew the dragons
Gave room and scope for sweeter things;
The teeth whence poison dripped in flagons
Were buried under fairy rings;
The claws as big as kitchen ranges
Were sealed within the iron hill;
And nature through the vast world-changes
Sticks to her ancient notion still.
The big things go. I watch and wonder:
I mark the monsters as they roar.
War, overgrown, in fossil thunder
Shall be a memory and no more.
The trusts and millionaires must follow,
The empires crumble and decay,
The crowded cities, puffed and hollow,
Pricked with a pin shall pass away.
The law admits of no escaping,
Though folly dance and wisdom frown ;
The buildings that the skies are scraping
In heaps of stone shall tumble down.
’Tis vain to parley or dissemble,
’Tis vain to sorrow or regret—
Ah, thought that makes my whiskers tremble 1

Dalgety’s had another wonderful year to
June 30 last, notwithstanding the drought in
the earlier months. All-round abnormally
high prices more than compensated for
smaller turnover of produce, and the £957,298
of gross profits were nearly £lOO,OOO more
than for the previous year, and were easily
a record. Average gross profits for the five
years to 1915 were £562,600. Though exes,
have mounted rapidly, last year there. was
nearly £76,000 more available for the million
of ordinary capital than in 1915. And the
directors have not been backward in passing
out most of that additional 71 p.c. to share-
holders ; divs. have been taken from 8 p.c. to
15 p.c., free of income taxes in both in-
stances. Actually the co. did even better
than the figures indicate, for gross profits
are shown less provision for bad debts and
less depreciation, and apparently £111,497
was clipped from last year’s profits to cover
the heavy drop in the market value of the
string of gilt-edged securities held by the
co. It is unlikely that the management will
have to realise on these investments before
they mature, and a comparison of the hold-
ings with book values indicates that writ-
ings-down during recent years have alone put
close upon £300,000 up the sleeve. If the
co. is not forced to realise at these reduced
book values, then the effect of the writing-off
has been to reduce recent actual net profits
by that £300,000. This fact must also be
taken into account when considering reserves,
the visible portion of which now, for the
first time, exceeds ordinary capital. The
visible reserves have been further influenced
by reductions made in the book value of
premises. As the table shows, during the
past five years £245,000 of earnings has
been used to write down this account, and
some at least of it can be safely regarded as
internal reserves, for hard writing-down had
been proceeding for many years prior to
1915. Particular attention has apparently
been given to the book value of premises and
stores erected during the recent, period of
high costs. It is thus clear that besides the
million or so of visible reserves there are
very considerable inner reserves.
There have been no capital movements
over many years. But besides . the million
of ordinary capital and half-million of prefs.
(cheap money in these days, for they carry
only 5 p.c.) the co. also works on a large
volume of very chean outside money .more
or less permanently attached to the business.
The details are visible in this comparison
of the balance-sheet movements over two five-
year periods:—

Though the debenture debt has been reduced
by £547,545 (from £2,885,247 to £2,837,702)
during the past 10 years the management
is slowly buying up these stocks, which
have steadily depreciated in the market as
money has become dearer —the loss of these
funds has been more than replaced by
accumulated profit. Notwithstanding the
wide expansion of business, the holding, or
larger stocks, etc., the additional piemises
and the repayment ' of debentures, the
balance-sheet now shows £725.000 more loose
cash, etc., than it did a decade ago. The past
five years have, of course, been very fat. In-
cluding the debenture debt and declared divs.
with liabilities the visible improvement from
the point of view of shareholders has been
as follows:- mo
Total assets.. £7,442,337 £8,153,061 Inc, £710,724
Liabilities . . 5,012,650 5,443,056 Inc. 430,906
Surplus assets £2,429,687 £2,709,505 Inc. £279,818
During that period shareholders have had
£3 6s. per £5 paid share returned in divs.
(free of income tax), a further £1 Bs. per
share has been visibly stored, besides which
large internal reserves have been accumu-
lated. It is a glittering record. But it will
be surprising if the very handsome profats
shown recently can be maintained. A de-
dining market will result in reduced com-
mission earnings, though the directors anti-
cipate that the present record wheat harvest
and the good price it should bring will this
year compensate for the dulness in the wool
market.

Seven months after the State Office was
opened to transact workmen’s compensation
insurance, a fire branch was established, and
the experience since the first policy was
written is set out in the table above, since
the close of the first financial year 57,10 a
new policies have been written, and no less
than 47,114 of them have been in respect of
dwellings, a particularly favorable class of
risk. Just prior to the opening of the 191 J
financial year the Commissioner commenced
rate-cutting, the premiums on dwellings being
reduced by one-third, and rates for general
business by one-fifth. Consequently, though
new business for 1919 brought in £27,818
of premiums, income increased only by
the £8270 shown in the table. Notwith-
standing these rate reductions the under-
writing experience has worked out very
favorably:—
Loss Rate. Expense Rate.
?918.. •• 10.8 p.c. 45*3 p.c.
1919.. . y 22.5 „ 39.3 „
1920.. .. 26.9 ~ 41.6 „
Thus 31.5 p.c. of last year’s total income re-
mained in hand, not all of it profit, of
course, for some of the risks for which pre-
miums had been received had not expired at'
the balance. To meet any possible claims
from this unexpired business the Commis-
sioner set aside the customary 40 p.c. of net
premiums, £26,839, in an unearned premium
reserve, which is included in the reserves
shown in the introductory table. The whole
of the £54,631 shown as accumulated by this
department' is not, however, left with the
branch. As in the case of the workmens
compensation department, there have been
transfers to the general reserves of the
Office, and so far £15,316 of fire funds have
gone there, the interest earnings from which
are not credited to the department that
accumulated them. Only £1369 of interest
earnings are shown in the fire accounts,
equal to a poor return of 3.1 p.c. on average
funds. t \ .
One feature of this department is that it
has not entirely dispensed with Private
Enterprise. Total premiums collected last
year amounted to £98,400, but £13,391 of this
was laid out on treaty arrangements and
£9092 went in local re-insurances. Ex-
Commis.*-;oner Goodwin also followed a com-
mon practice amongst English cos. and estab-
lished an internal re-insurance fund into
which last year £8824 was dropped and
£5162 extracted to meet claims. Another
feature of the fire branch is that, unlike the
workmen’s compensation dept., it is called
upon to pay taxes, and it also contributes to
fire-brigades: last year £690 went to the
latter, while £2678 was paid in stamp duties
and £1336 in income tax. At June 30 last
the branch had accumulated funds almost
ample to meet claims three times the size
of the year’s losses. The policy-holder, how-
ever, in this office need not concern _ himself
much with the relation of funds to risks, for
the Commissioner has the State to fall back
upon at any time. On the other hand, there
is always the possibility of the State falling
back upon the Commissioner.
A marine insurance branch was established
in May, 1919. Gross premiums for the 12
months to June 30 last were £7374,. of which
£4898 was laid off, giving a net premium
income of £247G. Of this claims called foi
only £722 and exes, took £859, and the
branch closed its books with reserves of £l4ll.
There is also a miscellaneous accident depart-
ment, which last year produced £8449 of net
premiums, of which £3096 went in claims
and £3643 in exes., leaving accumulated re-
serves, including amounts dropped into gen-
eral reserves, of over £BOOO.
Robekt Reid and Co., Ltd. —A couple of
years ago this old-established soltgoods con-
cern, which had its headquarters in London,
decided that John Bull was making things
too hot with his “double taxation.’’ Most
of the co.’s profits were made in the Com-
monwealth, where, of course, they were sub-
ject to taxation, with the certain prospect
of early increases; but the British Govern-
ment also decided that it should have a bite.
Considerable pressure was put upon the
British Treasury to lighten the burden, and
though some relief from duplicated taxation
\vas granted to Australian cos. registered in
the Cold Country, it has since been counter-
acted by a new Corporation Tax. So
Robert Reid’s is not sorry that in 1918 it
decided to transfer its books to Australia,
Before effecting the change there were
several obstacles to overcome. Besides its
ordinary capital—'in the hands of the old
proprietors —the co. had been working on
£200,000 of pref. capital and £150,000 of
debentures. To relieve the register of
these interests when transferring to Mel-
bourne it was decided to put the old co. into
liquidation and raise similar of
pref. capital and debentures in the Com-
monwealth. In May, 1919, Australian
prefs. carrying 7 p.c. were offered to replace
the old 54 p.c. English scrip, and local 6
pc. mortgage debenture stock to cover the'
old 4f p.c. debentures. The security for
both lots being excellent, the public snapped
the issues. Outside the prefs. and the mort-
gage debentures the public is not interested,
for the ordinaries are close held by the old
proprietary interests.
The balance-sheet recently issued, covering
operations for he 12 months to J une 30
last, is the second published locally ; but the
1919 accounts were put out early in the pro-
cess of liquidation and re-ilotation. The
latest illustrate what a magnificent time
tUese big importing houses laid last year.
Net profits, after deducting certain pay-
ments to the liquidator of the English co.,
debenture interest and all other charges,
were £319,562. Deducting the prefs.’ 7 p.c.,
there remained a visible £305,000-odd avail-
able for the £522,050 of ordinaries, repre-
senting a return exceeding 58 p.c. But though
in the reconstruction the ordinaries got two
shares for one (this absorbed portion of old
reserves), and though ju.st prior to the clos-
ing of the latest accounts £74,581 bonus
ordinaries were issued, the transfers by no
means absorbed all available visible reserves.
At the balance, besides paid capital, there
was close upon half a million laid by. But
even on total funds the past year’s profits
were extraordinarily handsome. Robert
Reid’s simply couldn’t help it; there was
“an unprecedented increase in the amount
of trade done,” say the directors. The
ordinaries apparently got 10 p.c. divs., but
reserves have been tapped to provide a bonus
issue of a further 56,985 £1 fully-paids. As
a result of the heavy stocks held, outside
liabilities at June 30 exceeded a million;
but that need not have worried the prefs.
at all, for including the debentures with those
debts there were tangible net assets with a
book value of £1,202.438 to protect their
£200,000 of capital. The strain of financing
the business since the balance has become
more severe, and the directors have been
considering an issue of second prefs.

Notwithstanding adverse marketing condi-
tions last half-year Morgan was more active
than it had been during the previous couple
of terms. Altogether 172,343 tons ore was
raised, and the smelters turned out 3451 tons
copper and 52,8660 z. gold. The period
opened with abnormally large stocks of metal
on hand and in process of refining, and closed
with the position still further aggravated.
In May there were 4432 tons unrealised, and
in November 5035, from which it appears
that a market was found for 2850 tons dur-
ing the six months. At one time Morgan
used to disclose the average price realised
during each term, but nowadays it is silent
on the subject. The £106.274 does not, of
course, represent the profit resulting from
the past half’s mining operations; in fact,
probably the whole of that term’s copper
production remained unsold and the co.
does not yet know what will eventually be
forthcoming for it. Meantime, the stuff has
gone into the books at £55, the figure at
which Morgan has long taken credit for its
stocks, and which nowadays is a long way
below production costs. The profit now
show T n is mostly the difference between the
£55 per ton at which old stocks were taken
in, and the actual price realised during the
term. During the six months the London
average price of standard copper was in the
nineties, £2O or so less than just previously.
No doubt, with the high gold premium—a big
item on a 50,0000 z. output —copper at over
£9O suited Morgan well enough. But
towards the close of the term the bottom
began to drop out of the metal markets, and
lately the pink metal has sagged below £7si
In pre-war days Morgan was able to do
handsomely round about that but
since then wages have increased about 75 p.c.,
while the cost of some stores are as much as
four times what they used to be. Practically
all Australian copper producers have gone
under to the market collapse; general-
manager Boyd still hopes to keep Morgan at

that the world’s prices will look up soon.
At the November balance stocks of blister
on hand, on the £55-per-ton basis, were
included at £411,766, compared with
£257,364 12 months ago. To finance this
huge accumulation Morgan was leaning on
its bankers and others for £313,637. The
liquid position compares with 12 months
previously in this way:—

Surplus assets . . £686.578 £768,874
Though no div. was paid during the past
half, in the earlier term £lOO,OOO (= 10 p.c.
on paid capital) was passed out to share-
holders. In view of that distribution and
the concurrent improvement of £82,296 in
the liquid position, and not overlooking the
fact that accumulating stocks of copper
have been taken credit for at only £55 per
ton, Morgan has thus kept its end up well
during a difficult period. Of the_£296,150 of
investments shown above £47,725 represents
debentures, mostly Illawarra Coke and
Electrolytic Refining. Share interests in-
clude £130,307 in the Kembla refineries,
£50,096 in Metal Manufactures, which is
turning out copper wire, cables, tubing, etc.,
and £64,996 in the Australian Fertilizers
Pty., Ltd., another Kembla enterprise which,
in the first instance, is being established to
provide the refineries with sulphuric acid,
but which is also going into the fertiliser
trade. Initial plant with a capacity of
up to 40,000 tons super per annum is being
built. The George Shirley and Elliott Bros.,
Ltd., fertiliser interests have been absorbed
in the enterprise.
Notwithstanding the large overdraft and
the unsatisfactory market position Morgan’s
financial position is very strong. Even
should the blister on hand realise no nrore
than the £55 per ton. the co. shows surplus
liquid assets in excess of 15b. per £1 share.
As to the future of this wonder-mine every-
thing depends on the copper market and the
reasonableness of labor. The former has
always been an erratic factor, and it is
impossible to tell what is ahead. The price,
however, is likely to improve before long,
when the financial stringency has relaxed,
stocks have been liquidated and the world
gets on a normal basis again. But how
the new prices will suit Australian pro-
ducers is another matter. Costs continue
to ascend, and though during the past year
there have-been considerable wage increases,
Morgan employees are again in court asking
for further concessions which, if granted,
manager Boyd declares, will add another
£58,000 to annual expenditure.
“Ex-Banker”: Four years ago The
Bulletin pointed out that the increased
interest rate on public loans was likely to
become onerous enough to seriously affect
every Government budget. The Common-
wealth owes roughly £406.000,000 and the
States £414.000,000; total £820,000,000. The
average rate of interest paid by the Common-
wealth is £4 12s. 2d. p.c. and by the States
£4 os. 3d. p.c.; £360,000,000 of these loans
will fall due by the end of 1927, and it is
unlikely they will be renewed much under
6| p.c.'So that the Federal interest bill will
be £3,854.530 larger annually and that of the
States £3,925,000. The stoppage of Queens-
land’s loans is as trifling as the wafting away
of thistledown and as small a circumstance
as one grain of mustard seed compared with
what is ahead. Already 1925 begins to look
like another annus mirabilis, because
£98,339,977 has to be renewed or paid-off or
converted by the feckless politicians who for
40 years have been mismanaging Australia’s
finances. This is my prophecy—Australia
in the near future will lead the way by
averaging the due date of payment of her

Ilampden-Cloncurry general-manager Erie
Huntley has been giving go-slow labor an-
other lecture. He produces figures for 10
years showing precisely who has had all the
cash that co. has handled. Since 1910 Hamp-
den-Clonciirry has smelted 689,000 tons ore
for. 00, *OJ tons copper, the gross value of
which was slightly more than 4£ millions.
Ihe total amount of money put into the
xm-- P evv 'was, apart from debentures,
xdoOjOUO. Shareholders have had £437,500
in divs. and £55,000 of investments in other
cos., giving them a total ‘of £492,500
representing a return of capital in 10 years
with an average p.c. p.a. on their invest-
ment. Even assuming that mine property,
etc., still guarantees a return of capital,
shareholders have had only 1.3 J p.c. p.a Of
the gross production worth £4.357,000, shar*-
and debenture-holders together got
rooo.bUO. Alanagement, office expenses and
c'\.f re , S xo°- n n^ realised together ab-
soibed £So,0()0, purchase of other mines and
°nnn t0 ° k /tIO.OUO, railway construction
, and . *270,000, a total of
£612,000, leaving £3,188,400 which has gone
m working expenses. Huntley figures that
4U.ob p.c. of this went directly to wage-
earners, and that 70 p.c. of the outlay on
coke, firewood and stores, 80 p.c. of realisa-
tion costs and 80 p.c. of the expenditure on
railways options, plant, etc., also went to
labor, which Huntley thus estimates got over
three millions. He adds :
H „ TI ” S n a 'i Jy sh ? W , s - that for every ' £l received by
s °' Ca JL ed ca P ltahst > or speculator, or adventurer,
and by the railways and steamship cos., collieries
coke-makers and general suppliers or manufacturers, the
worker or wage-earner has received £4 15s. 9d
Surely, the wage-earner or worker does not want a
bettei return than this, which is equal to over 82.7
p.c. ol the total wealth produced from the energy and
capital invested. I want it to be noted that these
figures are based on an average rate of wages paid
during the past 10 years, and it is a fact that at the
present time wages are over 25 p.e. higher than the
above average. If the present rate of wages had been
current during the period under review, the worker
or wage-earner would have demanded £3,841 340
against a product worth £3,715,400.
So far as the worker is concerned, there seems to
be nothing wrong with the system. But the questions
are. Can the present (or any) system be continued?
Can we compete with our products in the world’s
markets { The answer is, I think, “Certainly not, if
the workers insist in their demands to do less work
for a given amount of money.” I say, without
hesitation, that these defnands and the failure of
the workers, on the average, to give a reasonable
equivalent of work for the money received, is, and
will be the first and foremost cause of the curtail-
ment of primary industries in Australia.
I am aware that these statements will be criticised
and that bad management will be put forward
as the cause of failure. But, in this particular in-
dustry, what constitutes bad management? (1)
Employing too many men to do a certain job; (2)
spending too much money on experiments, prospect-
ing or development; and (3) utilisation of obsolete
or inefficient machinery. In regard to (1) I must
plead guilty, but am doubtful whether the workers
will agree. The reason is that 1 have been unable
to get fewer men to do the. work. In regard to (2),
about 65,000 ft. of prospecting and development
work - has been done—not such a bad showing for
50,000-odd tons of copper—and about £30,000 has
been spent, equal to say three-quarters of 1 p.c. of
the product, in experiments to treat lower-grade ore,
and this has been under the supervision and direction
of the best experts and brains available. In regard
to (3), the mining and treatment plants are as com-
pact and up-to-date as anything in Australia, and the
power-plant, for its size, compares favorably, having
regard to the cost of fuel, with any plant for arti-
ficially-produced power in the world. So much for
management.
Huntley declares that had Ilampden-Clon-
curry been given 10 p.c. more efficiency from
the worker the industry would be prosperous
to-day.

“J.L.S.”: Wells drilled at Ruthven, Roma,
bpringleigh and in one or two other districts
within ail area of 12,000 sq. miles in Queens-
land have to date yielded only a little oil,
some highly inspissated petroleum of the
nature of soft bitumen and strong flows of
•‘wet” gas. Evidence from the drill and
field shows that the geological structure so
far as revealed is not favorable to the con-
centration of petroleum towards any definite
or restricted localities, as over a great extent
of country there is a thick cretaceous series
with no appreciable dip, though the under-
lying rocks do outcrop some 50 miles from
Roma. Cunningkam-Craig, the leading
British oil-geologist, has it that the strata
have certainly contained oil. which, however,
Has never concentrated, but has been inspis-
sated and adsorbed at great depth, leaving
only the gas to be tapped in quantity be-
neath the artesian water iri favorable locali-
ties. _ In other words, the district in ques-
tion is a has-been oilfield. Other instances
of the samq sort of thing are met with in
the cretaceous series of Western Canada.
Geologist Jensen, if successful in finding
likely oil country north, will be able to
ensure a much better run for the Queens-
land Government than it has had at Roma.

The final scrap over Badak was a tame
affair. This was because directors Scar-
borough and Clark side-stepped cross-ex-
amination by their silence. The move in
favor of a wind-up got a majority of only
11,760, the ayes recording 173,586 votes.
There is £25,000 in the till, which on a re-
gister of 600,000 shares pans out at lOd. per
share. An awkward legal point has to be
considered. Solicitor Keane, when asked if
prospector Orton intended to take a liquida-
tion div. on his wad of scrip, declared that he
knew of no law to deprive a shareholder of
whatever amount was due to him from the
assets of a co. But don’t the holders of paid-
ups, of which there are 400,000 (paid to
205.), have first call, after which the con-
tribs., 200,000 paid up to 45., come in? The
usual procedure in no-liability mining cos.
is for all scrip to share alike in a liquidation
div., but there are numerous instances where
cautious directors have found that any dis-
tribution must have regard to the rights of
the paid-ups. So another reason exists for
running risks in mining rather than passing
out cash for law expenses, or as an alterna-
tive letting the paids (promoter’s shares, as
a rule) get what should, in all fairness, go
back to the contribs.

“Die Mihi”: I must join issue with
J.L.S.” (B. 30/12/’2O). Why must Mor-
well become “the ultimate source of Victoria’s
fuel requirements”? Morwell is not the only
spot in Victoria where brown coal in great
quantity and of good quality can be mined
by steam shovels in open cuts. There is
excellent brown coal near the surface at
Dal Lai, Yaloak Vale and Dean’s Marsh,
while at Altona, 10 miles from Melbourne,
there is a brown coal field of good quality
which covers 100 square miles. In South
Gippsland an area of 600 square miles of
brown coal _ has been bored and surveyed,
while there is plenty of this fuel near Corner
Inlet, which may some day become a bunker-
ing port for steamers. At Queen sferry.
Western Port, there is one black coal body of
20,000,000 tons simply • scratched and not
developed. At Casterton there is good black
coal, and near the source of the Hopkins
River black coal was located many years
ago. There is no need to make Morwell the
sole source of supply for either power or fuel
in Victoria and it is a crazy policy to adopt.
Why leave the development of the Iviewa
hydro-electric scheme to posterity ? Why
not proceed with it at once so as to serve the
northern districts at least with power? Long
ago the Trawool hydro-electric scheme was
pronounced feasible and was abandoned only
because it meant drowning Yea. Why not
link up Kiewa and Trawool and squeeze out
every available kilowatt?

Minerals Separation, Ltd., the English
co. whose offshoot in Australia is Minerals
Separation and De Bavay’s, has a string of
new interesting processes in the hands of its
metallurgists. During recent years the co.
has been very active amongst old coal heaps
in the U.lv. and elsewhere, and it is now
putting down flotation plants which are de-
clared to be successful in completely recover-
ing the coal, even though it be in the form
of fine dust. The co. has also become in-
terested in a liquid fuel process developed
in U.S.A. during the war. Works are going
up on the Thames to ascertain whether this
colloidalising process can be made com-
mercially profitable, particularly if worked in
conjunction with coal flotation. Minerals
separation's achievement last year was the
successful treatment of oxidised copper de-
posits in Rhodesia. Also, further advance
was made in the concentration of both
tin and gold ores; two new-type plants are
at work on a commercial scale producing
‘remarkable results” with the precious metal.
One of the newest processes is a preparation
which is claimed to entirely prevent rust in
iron and steel, from delicate machinery to
agricultural implements and domestic articles.
“Sozol” is the name of the preparation which
is to rout the rust enemy, and the process has
been tested to the stage that it resists even
sulphuric acid and salammoniac. Australian
J. C. Moulden, one of the big men from
Broken Hill, now occupies a seat on this
English co.’s Board. .

Cloncurry (Q.) has for some time cast
an interested eye on the big deposits of coal
at White Mountain. This field should have
been feeding the hungry smelters for years
past, but its isolation has been the chief
obstacle to its development. The Mountain
contains a seam of coal 14ft. to 16ft. thick,
but while the top half includes a good many
bands there is Bft. of solid coal with only one
small band, and analyses of this Bft. show
15 p.c. to 17 p.c. ash. which is not too bad
in a place where one cannot pick and choose.
It is the only workable seam known in the
whole stretch of country through which the
Townsville-Cloncurry railway runs. Unfor-
tunately it is nearly 40 miles from Torrens
Creek, the nearest point on this line. It is
a fine locomotive coal, and has been exhaus-
tively tested on the northern railways, proving
to be absolutely non-clinkering, and in every
way it came up to requirements. A railway
to this place 10 years ago would have been
a godsend to Cloneurry smelters, and inci-
dentally it would have supplied all railway
coal used west of Charters Towers. The
syndicate that took up the area put down
half-a-dozen diamond-drill bores and tested
the seam to a depth of 150 ft. . Last year the
property was offered to the Government for
a State mine, but Ministers, apparently anti-
cipating the coming cold blast, turned it
down. Corbould, of Mt. Elliott, takes more
than a passing interest in the field, so it
may yet come into its own.

Developments during the last six months
have disclosed some promising shows on the
Normanby goldfield, behind Bowen (Q.).
Most of the work has been done by P. F.
Meredith’s syndicate, assisted by a Govern-
ment subsidy. The syndicate has discovered
a number of new reefs, including the Billy
Hughes, Two Blues and the Soldier Boy,
and has opened up the old Venture workings.
The Billy Hughes has given the best pros-
pects ; the workings are down 100 ft. on a
2ft. reef which carries nice gold values, with
a little zinc and bismuth. Water is now
coming in, and the syndicate has to secure
pumping plant, so that developments in
deeper ground will be delayed. Samples
from the Venture assayed 3|oz. The Two
Blues has a Ift. reef, from which represen-
tative samples gave loz. lldwt. All these
shows are within striking distance of Grant’s
Creek, about five miles from the old Nor-
manby township site, and it is now, a ques-
tion of putting up a small battery there
for a start. The Mines Department has just
sent a geologist to examine developments.
The field is worth keeping an eye on, for
although nothing very big has yet been found,
it is perhaps the most promising in the
northern State just now. It suffers from isola-
tion, bad roads and lack of crushing facili-
ties, but these difficulties will be quickly re-
moved if it develops successfully. Anyhow,
ore in sight assures that it will figure to
some extent in the 1921 gold yield.
* * * #
A start has at Inst been made on the old
Palmer goldfield (Q.) and the Louisa mine
is being unwatered. When further progress
has been made the Minister is to send up a
geologist to examine the various workings
and make a geological survey of the field.
Thompson’s Oaks (N.Q.), like its neighbor
the Oaks, is nowadays in the hands of a tri-
bute syndicate of shareholders who ffut up
cash to keep things going. During the past
two years the syndicate has spent over
£5OOO and been rewarded with the discovery
of the ore body, which has been followed
down oyer 70ft. Though erushings have re-
sulted in a small profit funds have petered
out. The syndicate is not losing heart,
though: it has agreed to the issue of an
additional 40,000 shares of 25., which shall
be preferential as to divs. to the extent of
the amount per share called up. For every
additional £2OOO put in the syndicate’s tri-
bute is to b« extended a year. The induce-
ment to risk more cash is that the reef
in the bottom of the winze has, in the last
firing, been proved to have opened out to
10ft. long by 2ft. wide, carrying 30z., and
manager Harley, formerly of the Tyrconnel,
is hopeful that it will develop into something
bigger. Also, 15ft. along the bottom level
a 2oz. body was met, and if the rise there
to the surface on ore there will be
850 ft. to stope out. There are other bodies
which, if handled economically, should pay.
but a 10-hd. battery is required for this lower-
grade stuff. The big gamble, though, is
whether the known pipes have been spewed
to the surface from a big ore body at depth.

While the wolfram market is low the In-
dustrial Pigments Co. is vigorously develop-
ing its fluorspar lode in the Mistake mine,
Emuford (N.Q.). A few potholes disclosed
a lode three to four feet thick, but a tunnel
recently cut 12ft. of clean fluor carrying a
little wolfram. This lode is parallel to the,
wolfram lode which was worked by Barrett,
the former owner of the Mistake.' The pre-
sent output is about 70 tons a week, and a
shipment recently sent to Sydney went 87
p.c. calcium fluoride and 3 p.c. silica. As
costs do not exceed 355. delivered on wharf
and the product is worth £5 a ton landed in
Sydney there 4s fair profit in it.

From Fred G. Brown, Sydney rep. of
Koorboora Mines (Q. ): —
I.S. ’ (B. 13/I/’2l) evidences a complete
ignorance of facts when he comments on the “Wild
Oats” par. (B. 25/11/’2O), which was wholly cor-
rect. • The Koorboora co. is a small proprietary,
whose main object was to bring some of the mines
to the producing stage. Strikes, and lack of ex-
plosives, etc., so hampered operations and increased
costs that the job proved too big for the proprie-
tary’s resources. When the old plant on the prin-
cipal mine (the Two Jacks) collapsed, cutting o ff
ore supplies, a shut-down was inevitable pending the
provision of further capital. Rather than see °some
of the old hands leave the place, the co. offered
9
certain portions of the shallower workings on
tribute. Two parties worked on the Jacks” (none
on the Dalnotter, as “T.S.” states). A party of
four raised 37 tons, which returned them 4.3 p c
tin, but, owing to having no machinery to haiifile
the water, they had to abandon the tribute: the
second party (two men), operating in No. 3 shaft
raised altogether 98 tons, which crushed 4J c ’
and this returned wages that even “T.S.” might
have been satisfied with.
' The Tennyson is certainly not a dead letter. The
only money spent on the surface was the erection of
a small head gear and the removal of a winding
engine to Central shaft. When the shut-down
appeared inevitable a sample crushing of 60 tons
(left in the stope by the old co., not by tributors)
was sent to the mill. The ore contains less zinc
than most ores of its class (average about 5 to 6
p.c.), and is a simple proposition for flotation. The
tribute referred to was left in a portion of the old
workings abandoned by the co. as valueless. “T.S.”
differs from all the competent authorities in his
opinion that the Neville is the best mine on the
field. Various engineers, some of world-wide repu-
tation, have stressed the possibilities of the Jacks,
but re-equipment and development are necessary
to meet the increase in wages and in cost of sup-
plies. This is the co.’s present aim, and 100,000
shares are shortly to be placed on the market. ’
The statement that all the machinery is lying at
the railway station is only partly true. Some of
it is already being erected at the Jacks. Lastly,
the Queensland Government never at any time offered
£5OOO or any other subsidy, as stated. Had it
done so, the co. would certainly have accepted, and
so avoided the present shut-down.

Perhaps because he struck up a friendship
with Edward P. during that young man’s
visit to Australia, or it may be because it is
Perth’s municipal jubilee, Bill Lathlain,
Mayor of the western capital, has been re-
buked with a K.B. It will console him for
a little disappointment he has had in the
litigious line —he sued a local weekly,, the
Call, for libel and was fobbed off with a
farthing and costs. One of the British
newspaper correspondents credited Lathlain
with the finest speech made by an Australian
mayor during the princely progress. “And
we seem to have heard millions,” he sighed.
Edwin Johnson returned briefly to the
mining township of Harrietville (Vic.) the
other day, and mentioned that it was 18
years since he had left the old place to go
to sea. He beeame in turn master of a
ship, doctor of medicine and doctor of
science. Nowadays he is president of the
Pacific Wassermann Research laboratories
in California, and helps the U.S.A. cocky to
farm the air by supplying him with the bac-
teria which fix the nitrogen. In his spare
time the energetic Australian put in a couple
of years in France on war service, and has
visited Alaska, Mexico and India, as well
as his own country.
Sam Copley, the chunky Yorkshireman
who laid the foundation of his fortune in a
Fremantle shaving saloon—Samuel did the
shaving and ran “a little double” on the side
—has added to his possessions the Palace
Hotel. Perth. It cost him £40,000, but that
would be a mere fleabite to Copley.
Alexander Macully, whose clerical coat-tails
have flown behind lnm in a good many parts
of Australia, has died at Brighton (S.A.),
where he had been settled for many years.
The erratic old man (he was over 70 at the
end) made no score as a C. of E. parson,
but until his memory failed —it was never
very good—he recited “The Bells” and other
such things with great success, and at vari-
ous times made a profession of it.
Thus this paper’s Gallery man:—
Michael Considine, M.H.R., passionately pacifist
and mild in his personal demeanor, has yet the
makings of a good policeman or pug somewhere up
in the middle-weight division. It is really strange
to see him, who is so sensitive to outrage or vio-
lence of any description, disturbing the peace of the
punching-ball in the Federal Parliament gym. A
hefty, well-built young fellow, the way he bangs
that bag of wind bodes no good for the first Mel-
bourne Clubman he encounters when the Bolshevik
republic is established. I am a small and enthusi-
astic amateur at the ball myself, but Considine’s
sustained wallop terrifies me. I sometimes wonder
whether he is practising to resist suspension, the next
time he interrupts the Chairman’s sleep.
. A good Australian of the fourth genera-
tion went west the other day in Charles
Helder Wedge, who was drowned at the
Bathurst (N.S.W.) State Farm. He was the
great-grand-nephew of John Helder Wedge,
who quitted a surveying job in the Speck
to be one of Batman’s partners in the Port
Phillip speculation. John Helder Wedge
crossed the Straits in 1835. in time to warn
Johnny Fawkner’s party off the site of Mel-
bourne. When the vessel on which Charles
Helder Wedge was wireless operator was
torpedoed he escaped in his pyjamas—to be
drowned in a dam, after all.
Rudolf Bock, the queer old chap who
hanged himself in the old N. Sydney store-
room he lived in, and was found to have
£l6OO in the bank, belonged to a band of
revolutionaries from Europe who form a
little community of their own. Miserly
to the last degree, he yet had money to
spare for “brothers” in need: during the
war he assisted many persons of Teutonic
extraction who were having a hard time
owing to their nationality. There is, of
course, a suspicion that the money he dis-
tributed and the money that remained in the
bank was not his own.
M. F. McNamara is the new Inspector-
General of the State Bank of S. Aus. He

Suburb Commissioner, finding homes for

About a good Australian whom Australia
never saw:—
One of the few non-Australians who held rank
in the A.I.F. was Father Bergen. He was in Pales-
tine on a pilgrimage to the holy places when war
broke out, and was taken prisoner by the Turks.
Escaping, he made his way by various routes and
in different characters to Egypt, and the L.H. being
short of a padre he became unofficially attached.
SENATOR DE LARGIE (W.A.), who has
been having a difference lately with the
President of the Senate.
When his unit went to the Peninsula he was taken
on the strength. As a padre he served right through
the Gallipoli campaign and afterwards went to
France. By this time he had become a Digger in
spirit, and his one idea was to migrate to Australia if
he lived through the war. But it was not to be.
He carried on until Passchendaele, but a shell got
him near the railway dugout at Zonnebeke, when he
was actually within a yard of safety. So great was
the regret when the gallant soggarth was killed that
for his burial he was carried back six miles by
volunteers.
Winning the N. S. Wales chess champion-
ship is nothing new to Spencer Crackan-
thorp, for he gained the distinction when a
lad. His father, L. S. Crac-kanthorp, who
taught him the game before lie was six years
old, was in the recent competition, but fin-
ished in the ruck. Both of them went to
the war.
Dr. Macaulay, who passed out ,in Mel-
bourne recently, was head of the Westralian
Y.M.C.A. during the war and a big man
among the prohibitionists. He was a courtly
and benevolent old gentleman, and even
when _he stood for Parliament on a ticket
that included the abolition of horse-racing
and mixed ablutions and the revival of the
curfew, or something like it, the critics
treated him with respect. He was beaten,
of course, but took his licking so manfully
that even Bung and the bookie declared him
a “sport.” A Puritan in a Cavalier setting
was the old doc.
H. W. Potts, who is trying to work up
Australian and especially Victorian farmers
to the ideal of establishing their own flour-
mills and eliminating middlemen, was one
of the rank and file of the expert staff of
the Vic. Agricultural Department 20 years
ago. He threw up his job because he' saw
no hope of advancement, and became princi-
pal of the Hawkdibury Agricultural College
in the Ma State. Victoria soon began to
get sorry for itself that it let him go, especi-
ally as the imported Williamson Wallace was
not up to expectations. Potts has a lot of
go in him yet, though he has retired from
Hawkesbury.
“M. Mulligatawny”: “Lex” (B. 13/1/’2l)
is in error when he says that Rufus Isaacs
was “eventually defeated in Reading by Les-
lie Wilson, who was A.D.C. to Governor
Rawson of N. S. Wales 17 or 18 years ago.”
As a matter of fact Wilson became member
for Reading on the elevation of Isaacs, then
Attorney-General, to the Chief Justiceship,
following Lord Alverstone’s retirement in
1912. Wilson regained the seat for the Con-
servatives by a decent majority, and has held
it since. Like Isaacs he has not made his
mark in the Commons, though he has been
Under-Seci-etary for Shipping since 1919. He
possesses a couple of war decorations, a rich
wife (she was a Sydney girl) and a charm-
ing personality.
When Daniel O’Connor paid his first
visit to Melbourne as P.M.G. in the N. S.
Wales Government, he stepped from the
train at Spencer-street and stood on the
platform. Apparently he expected some-
thing in the nature of a reception, but there
was nobody to meet him. “Is there no mis-
take,” said he to the conductor—“are ye
quite sure this is Melbourne?” The con-
ductor assured him it was Melbourne all
right, and Dan moved on, when suddenly and
clearly a voice cried : “Have a drink! Have
a drink!” Dan turned joyfully. “Thank
God,” said he, “here’s somebody that knows
me “Have a drink ! Have a drink !”
repeated the voice, and Dan saw a cockatoo
in a cage on a pile of luggage. “Have a
drink,” said Cockie. “All right,” replied
Dan, opening the cage, “where will we go?”
“T. 8.”: One would never have recognised
Paul Joseph, the Digger (B. 23/12/’2O), for
the fashionable S.A. parson who had yearned
to build a lordly tabernacle. He was quiet
and unassuming to a degree. Rarely did
more than a mild swear-word escape him.
and yet he had privations enough. Neither
cold nor Fritz provoked him into bitterness
(I know, for I slept next to him during the
winter of 1917-18), and he was always with-
out cardigan, vest, underpants and muffler.
A dour fighter, he was ready to scale the
bags on any quest and at any time. He
went west at Monument Wood on Mav 3
1918.
“Dido”: When “The Dipsomaniac,” Henry
Cargill, came from Adelaide, after outraging
its feelings and insulting its Constitution by
raining abuse of a profane nature down
upon its Leg. Assembly, he was given work
on the Age, but there was much dubiety
concerning him in that sober and reputable
office, and in a verv short time Henry had a
dispute with David Syme over the price of
-certain articles. Cargill had not gone
soberly to work with his plea, and David was
soon threatening to throw Henry through
the window. Henry continued his heated
opinions, so David arose, and carefully
opened the window. “D’ye think I’ll not
do it?” he asked. Henry had his hand on
the door-knob. “Oh, you’d do it,” he said.
“You’d do it, I know—if only to save wear
and tear on the stair-carpet 1” Then Henrv
left.
“10-2-4’s” memory :—■ 5
I have a friend who holds a humble record in
which he takes a certain pride. He was the first
member of the A.I.F. to be crimed. Having en-
listed at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, less than an
hour after the call sounded for volunteers, he was
under close arrest for being drank on duty 45
minutes'later. He accomplished the feat under one
of the fig-trees at the eastern end of the parade-
ground in company with a civilian friend, which
induced the martial and legal tyro before whom he
appeared when sober to direct that he should be

tralian howler, who note has a desk at
the Savings Bank in Sydney.
charged not under section 19 of the Army Act, but
under Section 45, Sub-section 2 (Chap. VII), namely,
with “unlawfully causing another to take poison,
or other noxious thing, so as to cause him grievous
bodily harm, or with the intent that he be injured
or annoyed.” When this tangle had been straight-
ened out by the interposition of a W.O. who, outside
the C.M.F.', was a bookmaker’s clerk, it was found
that Bill—my friend—had not yet been issued with
a pay-book in which to inscribe particulars of his
offence and punishment. At this stage he attempted
to bring a cross-suit against the sergeant of the
guard for the larceny of his boots, the sergeant
having removed them, in accordance w’ith the Regs.,
while Bill lay stupefied in the clink. Bitterness at
the arrogance and inequity of military methods led
to his being three times presented for drunkenness
and once for A.W.L. before embarkation; and his
list of convictions in Egypt (he never reached Gal-
lipoli) and England (he failed to see France) was
impressive. It w r ould be unfair to specify further, as
he is now' a verger in a suburban church.
DENNY DENEEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Denis Deneen was severely scalded in regaining
control of the locomotive of the Melbourne express,
after having been blown back into the tender by an
explosion of steam. Amid great clouds of smoke and
steam he secured control and stopped the train. His
injuries caused Deneen’s first absence from duty in
40 years.”
The loco.’s rocking drivers swallow the road of steel,
Denny Deneen!
The crowded coaches follow the power, all twinkling
wheel in wheel,
Denny Deneen!
And the white exhaust has slipped its gear, and
flooded the engine-fire,
And there is the chance of wreck and death, and
agony that is dire;
But Denny Deneen stood steadfastly to his duty and
his hire—
Denny Deneen.
If it had been in Denver or Toronto or Montreal,
Denny Deneen;
If it had happened in Norway among the pine-trees
tall,
Denny Deneen ;
If the firebox had flooded at Glasgow, Carlisle, Bath
or Crewe,
There’d be poets poeting everywhere the earth grows
an elm or yew;
But hero-worshippers are scarce in this land of ours
that’s new,
Denny Deneen?
There was a bloke named Jim Bludso, and, like
you, an engineer,
Denny Deneen.
The fool at the throttle roasted, though it helped no
man to steer,
Denny Deneen,
The Prairie Belle from mid-river to be beached on
the river bank;
But Jim Bludso stayed and roasted, to save the
starboard after-tank.
But that was in the United States ; and, if you’re
not English, be Yank,
Denny Deneen!
For this is only Australia, where all is common-
place,
Denny Deneen!
If you were only in Illinois how epic that loco, race,
Denny Deneen !
And you in the smoke and darkness groping for the
controls
To save the Butchers’ Picnic and its “nigh on a
thousand souls,”
While the sob-reporter lies, and on the circulation
rolls,
Denny Deneen.
For we love the things that are distant—the Empire
and Freetrade,
Denny Deneen ;
We think that our land for the “old” land was a
slave and a helot made,
Denny Deneen ;
There can never be an Armada sunk off Botany Bay,
Nor a crucifixion at Lithgow, nor a hero find his
way
At Menangle Park; for all these things can happen
but worlds away,
Denny Deneen!
But Casabianca stayed and grilled because his pa
was dead,
Denny Deneen!
Which signifies that Casablanca's fat was in his
head,
Denny Deneen,
As there’s fat in the head of the people who see but
the good afar,
And the hero in Montana choking the grizzly b’ar,
And Bludso who cooked in the Prairie Belle, where
the other liars are,
Denny Deneen!

MINCHINBURY
From a Sydney consulting-room :
Every surfing season many enthusiasts are placed
hors de combat through an attack of acute myrin-
gitis, which means an inflammation of the super-
ficial layers of the tympanum, and this is caused by
the direct contact of salt water with this delicate
membrane. Though Nature comes to our aid by
making the auditory canal somewhat tortuous, salt
water does ; come into contact with the drum occa-
sionally,, and sets yip a train of symptoms which are
the reverse of pleasant. Victims get deafness, mod-
erate pain in one or both ears, noises in the head,
and, sometimes, attacks of giddiness. Inspection
of the drum shows injection of the bloodvessels, more
or less obliteration of the landmarks, and occasion-
ally a few blood-stained blebs. Treatment consists
of cocaine or morphia drops in an oily solution,
cotton wool in the ear, and inflation by means of
Politzer's bag, which clears up the deafness. After
a few weeks patients are all right again—until
next time. One surfing enthusiast told me without
any circumlocution: “I’d much rather be deaf than
give up surfing,” and I’m sure he was in earnest.
Vet prevention is simple, and can be achieved by
putting small plugs of cotton-wool into the ears
every time the water is entered.

"Bovay”: The N. S. Wales Labor Gov-
ernment hasn’t much time for the A.1.P.,
but it is surely over the odcls that the public
should be given to understand that the
vandalism in Darling-hurst Gaol was the
work of Diggers. Minister for Education
Mutch, whose scandalised laments got free
publicity when his department took the
ruuied place over, apparently knows no dis-
tinction between fighting soldiers and
G.M.P. And, after all, how should he?
-Vs a matter of fact, the men who inhabited
the old gaol during most of the war bear
about the same relation to Aussies as the
Irish “Black and Tans” do to Irish Guards-
men. They took on a job that only the
scum of the A.I.F. would, as a rule, stomach,
and as there wasn’t much scum available
it followed that the place was mostly gar-
risoned by civilians. The best proof of it
is the fact that “window-sashes were torn
out bodily, valuable woodwork wantonly
smashed, and the whole interior portion of
the building given the appearance of a place
that had been occupied by an enemy garri-
son.” As tenants, the members of the Aus-
tralian Army bore an excellent reputation.
When Horseferry-road was given up the
London press made special reference to the
astonishing absence of dilapidations; and
Lord Rawlinson, who threw no superfluous
bouquets, and least of all at the Diggers,
whom he only liked as soldiers, wrou; of
them in France: “They were rarely in a
rest-area for anv length of time without im-
proving the billets considerably.”
“Caloola” : He weighed—red nose and all—
fully eight stone, and was explaining to us
how he shut up big Bill the butcher. “ ‘You’re
a liar,’ I says to ’im. ‘What!’ he thundered
—‘do you dare call me a liar, you miserable
little squid!’ ‘I do,’ says I defiantly, and if
you open your big mouth again I’ll soon cut
you short.’ ‘Cut me short?’ he roared back at
me. ‘Yes,’ says I, ‘and here goes.’ ” “Struth,
but you did take a risk talkin’ to Big- Bill
Jones like that,” said a listening Digger;
“and did you stop him?” “My oath,” said
the little man triumphantly—“l hung up the
receiver.”
“Boorara”: When the I.C.C. drew out of
the Jaffa sector in 1918 men and beasts were
all suffering from camel-pox.
At the rest-camp efforts were
made to rid us of the scourge,
and the Gyppo laborers, being
badly infected, had special
treatment. While their clothes
were being steam-disinfected
they were made to march,
through a tank full of lysol
solution. A hole about five feet
deep and 20 feet square was
dug in the sand and covered
with tarpaulin; water poured
on the canvas caused it to con-
form to the shape of the hole.
It was the first and, I suppose,
the only bath most of the nig-
gers had ever kadi and some of
them took a deal of persuasion
before entering the water. There
was quite a home-from-home flavor about the
business. It reminded me of a mob of tick-
infested cattle being driven through a dip.
“Mere Lemon’’: A striking triumph of
sovietism occurred last week in connection
with the Vic. Railway service. Ordinary
suburban trains had been reduced in numbqr
until the Commissioners talked of stopping
them altogether because they were so over-
crowded; week-end excursion fares were
suspended, Sunday travelling was cut out
altogether, and the public was threatened
with all sorts of further inconveniences owing
to shortage of coal caused by the strike of
ships’ stewards and the white ant of Wal-
sHevism. In fact, the news that race-trains
had been vetoed by the Commissioners was
the only consolation available to thoughtful
citizens. But while these restrictions were
being imposed upon all the world outside the
service, the Victorian Railways’ Union de-
manded four or five special trains for a “per-
manent employees’ excursion” to Frankston
on the following Saturday—and the Railway
Department, which had been shaking a stick
at the public, granted the demand without a
murmur! The employees protested that
tickets for the excursion had been sold and
“arrangements made” before the Commis-
sioners began to restrict the train services;
therefore the four or five specials to Frank-
ston had to be granted. Seemingly it. is
much easier .for public officers to treat a
reasonable public request with scorn than
DURING THE COAL SHORTAGE.
MELBOURNE HOUSEHOLDER (to burglar who, to facilitate matters, has lit both gas
jets): “I don’t wish to interfere with your work, my man, but you’ll make
trouble for me if you don’t turn off some of this gas.”
say No to an unreasonable demand from the
men who are employed in the public service.
There was no reason why the excursion
should not have been cancelled or postponed.
As for “arrangements” said to have been
made weeks ago—well, why should they have
remained sacred? Unionists never strike ex-
cept for the express purpose of upsetting as
many arrangements as possible, and who are
permanent railway employees that they
shouldn’t have their picnic anticipations
blighted?

“Wealsman”: Campbell Town, the tiny
sheep-show township on the main line be-
tween Hobart and Launceston, has just dis-
covered that it is about to become a cen-
tenarian. The village of dreams was christ-
ened by Governor Macquarie in person in
1821, and his Excellency on the same occa-
sion named the little river that meanders
past the hamlet the Elizabeth, in honor of
his wife. The Speck’s batch of Mac-
quaries includes a harbor, a river, a point,
a street, a house, an island and Macquarie
Plains, and there is a Lachlan River and
district, and an Elizabeth River and street
and a Campbell-street. Macquarie House,
Hobart, is now the local Trades Hall, and
Campbell-street is the street of the gaol,
unlovingly referred to by old hands as “The

HER FRIEND (looking at 'photograph of

Me for a couple of months!"
Tench” —short for “penitentiary.” Victoria,
probably owing to its youth, seems to have
pretty well escaped the Macquarie nomen-
elatural affliction. Melbourne’s Elizabeth-
street, unlike Sydney’s and Hobart’s, was
named without reference to Mrs. Macquarie.
Apparently the four chief north-and-south
streets of the Yarraside capital (King. Wil-
liam, Queen and Elizabeth) were named with
the idea of making the labels of two British
monarclis go as far as possible. Adelaide,
with its noble King William-street, was less
frugal of words and obtained a broader effect.

. “Tec”: Sydney and Melbourne crookdom
is experimenting with “snow,” otherwise
cocaine, and already the habit of “snuffing”
has a fair number of devotees, male and
female, in the underworld of both cities. I’m
tipping a new trouble to arise out of this,
for one effect of cocaine is an intense exhil-
aration and sense of physical strength, under
the influence of which the “snowbird” tackles
problems that he would shrink from con-
templating while normal. For the first
couple of years after :he has formed the
cocaine habit, the criminal becomes five times
as daring as he was without it, and so long
as he is armed will stand up to and fight
the whole police force. Moreover, without
the dope he is useless, and knows it; where-
fore, the “snowbird” crook, disturbed by the
police, is pretty sure to be under its influ-
ence. Of course, it doesn’t last long; in a
few years comes mental and physical degen-
eration, then complete uselessness and death.
“Kopai”: Another Victorian J.P. story.
Astonishment was caused at the appearance
on the bench of a justice who had not sat
for oyer a year; in fact, had not been resi-
dent in the town for that period. Whispers
then rose that his Worship and the defendant
in ii case listed that day were parties in an
ancient feud. Next morning, a guileless
paragraphist in the local daily welcomed to
duty after his long absence the once-regular
J.P., remarking innocently on the coincidence
which brought him back on the very day
upon which a local cnuse celebre was on the
register. The population grinned under-
,standingly, and the unhappy J.P. .had to
stay in town and attend regularly once or
twice a week for quite six months in order
to discount the implication of the newspaper
comment. By this time the public had for-
gotten, and the victim of curiosity—or some-
thing—was able to steal silently home.
Dood”: Every time I see a poker-machine
my thoughts fly to a now-dead German, Jack
Lander, who introduced them to Australia
somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 years
ago. He bought them for about 50s. a-piece
and retailed them for £lO 10s. When he
went west, after 10 years of harvesting, he
left a tidy parcel valued at £14,000. When
nearly every pub, club and barber’s shop
ran a machine, before the law looked in.
thousands of pounds were being made by

SUMMER LOVE-SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Youv arms round my neck —ah, their slightness
And exquisite form !
How the red blood exults through their whiteness!
Remove them! They’re warm.
There are flames lit by Venus that none dreads,
Joy’s fevered unrest;
But when mercury enters the hundreds
A quarrel is best.
Away with your passionate kisses
That fall like hot rain !
There are far more appropriate blisses
In icy disdain.
And raptures and roses arid vices,
Red wines—how they fail!
I had rather reflect on fair slices
Of cucumbers pale.
Gold shower of your smothering tresses
Is all very fine;
I had rather the shower-bath’s caresses
A-creep down my spine.
And the warmth of your passion that smoulders
Is all very sweet;
I had rather wet blankets, cold shoulders,
Or even cold feet.
ou have soft charms in plenty to please me,
Rare beauty beside;
Say, have you no falseness to freeze me,
Or icicle pride ?
Oh, tell me a treacherous story
I shiver to hear!
Or threaten revenge swift and gory
To chill me with fear!
LOOKING WELL AHEAD.
“I don't think your father will ever hear
of us being married.”
“Well , I know he devours all the Divorce
Court reports, so there's just a chance
he'll read of it there.”
In the Spring I showed flaming devotion'
And craved a return;
Yet, by all the cool depths of the ocean,
I begged you to burn!
I said love was a blaze, I remember,
Like bushfires that ranged;
But that was in far-off September,
And the weather has changed.
By the sun-stroke that hovers above me,
’Twas truth that I told ;
But now, dearest girl, if you love me
In pity be cold!
VICTORIA.

Power and Light
Makes the battery last longer
MAKES THE BATTERY LAST LONGER
BECAUSE the Battery is the life and soul
of an electric lighting plant, be sure to
understand the great advantage ot
Western Electric Power and Light before in-
vesting in any outfit that does not assuie
long life and freedom from Battery trouble.
Western Electric Power and Light makes the
Battery last longer, because of three import-
ant features.
GREATER CAPACITY. The Battery has a
capacity of 288 Ampere Hours (S-A.E. Rating)
nearly twice the capacity of other lighting plants.
This explains why users of Western Electric Power
and Light are able to use so many lights and at
the same time operate fans, sewing machines, wash-
ing machines, irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners ail
driven by electric current, without straining the
Battery.
GREATER STRENGTH. —The construction of the
Western Electric Battery is the result of over 50
years of electrical experience. The plates are extra
thick, and the general design such that danger of
buckling plates is eliminated.
TAPERING CHARGE.—Here is the important
Western Electric Feature that means so much to you
as a prospective user of electric light. You know
that quick heavy rain, leaving water standing in the
paddocks, does not penetrate the soil as a steady
soaking fall. The same is true with a Storage Bat-
tery. A continuous heavy charge not only wastes a
great deal of power, but the plates are heated, and
the surfaces twisted and crumbled. This shortens
the life of the Battery. But with the tapering charge
given by Western Electric Plant, the Battery re-
ceives a full charge at first, with a slow charge
towards the end; which allows electricity to P® ne “
trate each and every plate fully and evenly. And at
the moment when every plate has received its full
charge, the engine automatically stops.
:
■
m
These three Special Features of Western Electric Power and Light mean many pounds to
anv user because of the greater service and freedom from trouble which they assure. Yet,
despite its greater capacity and strength, Western Electric Power and Light is easy to buy,
and costs less to run. A far better investment than a small lighting plant that may be
a few pounds cheaper in first cost.

NOT UP TO SAMPLE.
“It was a case of love at first sight when I
met Billy.”
“Then why didn’t you marry him?”
“I met him again so often.”
“ D -” : I bought I knew them all till last
month. He was old—in fact, venerable—
and looked thoroughly respectable and
honest as he stopped me and in cultured
tones asked for five shillings. Despite his
appearance he had not had a meal for 24
hours. I produced the money and attempted
to make off. “Pardon me, sir,’’ he said,
hrmly detaining me, “I regard this not as a
girt but as a loan.” “It’s all right,” I assured
him ; you’ll do as much for me some day
perhaps. Forget about it”—and I again
essayed to break loose. “Next week,” he
went, on implacably, “I take up a lucrative
position. I will then repay your loan. I
insist. I should be obliged if you gave me
your name and address.” The money has
not been repaid. Instead, numbers of old
gentlemen, all intensely respectable and all
in imminent expectation of lucrative posi-
tions, have called and removed sums varying
from half-a-crown to ten shillings. I haAm
had the misfortune apparently to tap a
sort of club. Obviously the right mo\m was
to have given the original cadger the name
of the first enemy that came t<? mind, if
only as an insurance against subsequent loss
and worry. But such ideas, like telling re-
partees, only come when it is too late.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: The word “blank” developed
more shades of meaning in the A.I.F. than
any other noun you
can mention. Before
I enlisted I had imag-
ined that the light
application of the term
was sufficient reason
for a fi gh t; but
“blank” became so
common in the army
that it almost lost it's
fight-provoking signifi-
cance. A Tommy, giv-
ing directions in the
darkness, is alleged to
have said, “Go on,
and when you hear
some coves calling one
another blanks in a
friendly way, them’s
the Ors tralians!”
“Ain’t he a blank!”
might mean the limit
of admiration or the
extr e m e of scorn.
"Dear Bill, this is a
blank” was esteemed
the pithiest descrip-
tion of a soldier’s life
expressed in a letter.
A scathing criticism
of an officer was: “The
man who calls Jones
a man is a blank.” On
the other hand, con-
sider this collocation :
“The poor old blank
was ill; but some
blank must go and tell
the sarge that he’s off
post, and that blank
crimes him. After-
wards three pips let
him off. He's not
such a bad blank.”
There you have pity, scorn and appreciation
expressed in the one term.
* * * *
“Bill O’B.”: In Palestine, where Light
Horse troopers grew bow-legged with
months of service in the saddle, a routine
order was issued from G.H.Q. that “regiments
snail be sent back to the base in consecu-
tive batches for riding-school exercise.” The
school was at Zeitoun, near Cairo, and bored
veterans of Romani and Beersheba wearily
climbed on and off wooden dummy horses at
the dictation of a young Tommy officer.
‘Jump to it,” he yelled—“treat ’em as
though they were alive.” At this a long
trooper dug his heels viciously into the ribs
of his mount. Young Star's pounced on
lnm immediately. “What’d I kick him for?”
echoed Bill in injured tones. “Why, the
blighter bit me.”
* * * *
From a Northern laboratory :
Some time ago a case of leprosy turned up at the
Native Hospital in Rabaul, of the maculo-aricesthetic
variety, the patient’s history showing clearing that
the disease must have been from five to seven years
incubating. The classical case had an incubation
period of just over 10 years, the patient being an
Irishman who had never been away from his
native village. His brother, who had contracted
leprosy in the West Indies, died a few days after
i eturning to Ii eland, and his family, being unaware
of the cause of his death, divided up his clothes.
One brother wore a suit belonging to the dead man,
and more than 10 years afterwards developed the
nodular form of leprosy, from which the first patient
had suffered. That, however, was exceptional: two
to three years would seem to be about the average.
Incidentally, leprosy in any form has ceased to be
numbered among the list of incurable diseases, and
most of the credit for this is due to Australian doc-
tors. Already a number of cases in which, it is
believed, a cure has been effected have been released
under surveillance from the Brisbane lazarette. Some
years before the war a considerable stir was caused
in the medical world by the announcement that a
certain specific for the disease had been prepared by
the Turco-German specialist in tropical medicine,
Deyck Pasha, of Constantinople, the alleged “cure”
being known as nastin. This, however, in spite
of its undoubted efficacy in some eases, mostly those
of tubercular leprosy, in its early form, went the
way of all other “cures,” and since then medicine
has pinned its faith to chaulmoogra oil, or oleum
gynocardiae, which experience has taught is the
only dependable remedy, and with which the cases
at Brisbane have been treated.

“Bkeklip”: He was a burly M.L. sergeant
of Mechanical Transport, and was carting
IS-pounder ammunition behind Ploegsteert
\\ ood. His destination was a particularly
unhealthy locality known as Hyde Park
Corner. On arrival there he was'told by a
Tommy one-pipper to wait until it had been
ascertained where he was to deliver the
ammunition. The Maorilander replied that
lie had been told to go to Hyde Park Corner,
and he wasn’t damn well going to wait until
Fritz blew the tripe out of him. So, in spite
of protests, he unloaded and departed. Re-
turning with another load, he found the sub.
had brought a captain along with him. The
captain, a mild youth, decided that it was a
case for expostulation. “Surely,” he said, “you
don t speak so discourteously to your own
officers.” _ “Don’t I!” answered Sam from
W anganui. “Sometimes it’s all I can do to
keep my blanky hands off ’em.”
PASSED WITH HONORS.
“You are one of”
“Now. don’t tell me I’m the sweetest woman
you have ever kissed.”
“Certainly not; hut one of the few I want
to kiss again.”
“Muleteer”: Two missives that brightened
the dull routine of my grammar-grindery
last term:—
Please excuse Paddy for being away from school
yesterday. He had a bad Wicklow on his face.
Tom left school at dinner-time yesterday. All the
buttons fell oft' his' trousers, and he had to.
* * * .*
“Sparks” : It is an ingrained habit in Aus-
tralia to send Christmas greetings by tele-
graph. During the week that had Christ-
mas Day tied on behind, tens of thousands
of such messages, worded
alike or practically so,
were pushed across tele-
graph counters. O n
Christmas Eve this traf-
fic swelled to a torrent,
absolutely disorganising
ordinary business. For
three hours I shoved an
interminable string of con-
ventional greetings to a
N. S. Wales repeating
centre, and then came a
message that really mat-
tered—“ Come at once,
your mother dying.” And
I knew that the last
Sydney-bound train had
left an hour before.
Christmas messages,
though the text of
scores running may be precisely
alike, are each laboriously pounded
out, and thus the rate of handling
is the same as with ordinary biz—
-40 per hour. The thing should be
standardised, and the text, “A
Merry Christmas and a Happy New
lear,” printed on both sending and
receiving forms, as in M.L. There
the sender adds the address and
name, and these only are charged for
L-nder this system the rate of handling soars
to 180 per hour. Wires like the tragedy
quoted and business messages pay ordinary
rates, and, of course, then take priority.
“Callan Park” discusses a theory:
A Pom and a Pekinese disappeared from one
of the last M.L. steamers to arrive in Sydney during
the strike. They cost £3OO between them, and
the police think they were stolen. My theory is
that a dog-hater heaved them overboard. Dog-haters
are far commoner than dog-stealers, and their reli-
gion drives them to great lengths. All canine pro-
hibitionists have large families and are inarticulate.
My friend Mangles is a typical ease in point. When
I was at a University, many years ago, I remember
b6ng shown an improper epic about the dons, two
lines of which ran:
And next the angry Bembo, whose uxorious mind
Reeks but to reproduce his loathly kind.
That is Mangles. Continually sustaining unwanted
additions to his already monstrous family, and
chronically exasperated. So far as I can gather
he attributes all his troubles to other people’s pet
particularly poodles, and in a slightly less
degree Poms and Pekinese. The news that someone
is ieady to pay ±.50, or a tenner, or half-a-crown
for such creatures drives him frantic. “Look at
that!” he will hiss, indicating the advt. or what-
ever it is. “Ever hear of anyone offering even a
paltry shilling for a baby?” The spectacle of a
small dog being carried in a public place makes him
leap with fury. On the other hand, when this sort
of animal is allowed to run loose Mangles first calls
Heaven to witness the outrage done to the public
comfort, and then furtively kicks it in the name of
fruitful marriages. It is impossible for a dog-
owner to please him from any aspect. He blames
pet dogs for the modern practice of excluding child-
ren from flats (the line of reasoning being that
poodles, Poms and Pekinese are allowed in some of
these buildings), and the spectacle of a dog in a
motor-car satisfies him for the moment of the justice
of Bolshevism. If I were the detective in charge of
Sydney’s £ 300-dog case 1 would arrest any hard-
up male passenger who a few minutes before the
animals were missed got word that triplets or
even twins had been born to him. If Mangles hap-
pened to be on board I would of course arrest him
on general principles, and without reference to the
condition of the birth-rate.
“Sixenate”: The most exclusive club in
Sydney has its habitat in a small, quiet tea-
room. It is composed of intellectual anar-
chists and they meet regularly for discussions.
Io be included in that group is the ambition
of many revolutionaries who like to consider
themselves intellectuals; but, before admis-
sion is granted, existing members test the
candidate’s knowledge of Marxism, Tolstoy-
isin, Nietzseheism and several other ism's.
There hasn’t been a new initiate for four
years.

“Nell T.” on the experiences of back-
block teachers: —
My school was in the ranges (Vic.), and I had to
board at the local pub. Ma ran it —Ma and her
daughter Mary. Ma was a wisp of a woman, mousy
in color and wrinkled like a corrugated-iron tank.
Mary had the physical make-up of a gaunt, raw-
boned mare. Both possessed lurid vocabularies and
about once a week they would have a set-to. Ma
would refer copiously to an indiscretion of Mary’s,
and Mary would retort spiritedly on the moral im-
perfections of Ma. The controversy invariably ended
in Mary pounding Ma and Ma limping off, ’ threat-
ening to burn Mary and her brat in their beds. I
had come to regard the business as part of the
ordinary routine of life in the ranges when Ma,
arriving one morning with the egg and toast, re-
marked convulsively : “I had it all ready, kerosene
and all—all ready to set alight, but I didn’t want
to burn you, too. I like you, Miss. I’ll have to
wait.” That day I left. Evidently my successor
did not capture Ma’s affection, for I afterwards got
word that the pub had been burnt down. Some
shearers rescued Mary and her “mistake,” but Ma
was supposed to be sleeping it off in the bush. The
“mistake” found her when he raked in the ruins
next morning.
ESTABLISHING AN ALIBI.
FIRST WIFE: “ Why did your husband have
the electric light burning in the house
all day last month?”
SECOND WIFE : “Oh, I was away, and he
probably wanted to prove by the light
bill that he had never been out at night.”
MODERN SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the late end of December,
Tuesday night, the twenty-third—
There’s one date I can remember,
After all. It seems absurd—
At the late end of December,
Nineteen hundred twenty-two,
First I guessed (do you remember?)
That 1 was in love with you.
You were sweet and I was greedy
(Beauty lures the patient Beast!)
You were rich and I was needy:
That you will admit at least.
You were sweet and I was greedy,
There was nothing else to do.
Straight we sought a shipman needy,
And I flew away with you.
All the envious fools pursued us,
Spain, Bolivia,' Rekjavik ;
But no fear of man subdued us:
Night was warm, and blood was quick.
All the envious fools pursued us,
But your eyes were kind and true,
And no fear or doubt subdued us
As I lay and laughed with you.
Free clear air beneath, above us,
Midnight found New York below.
What care we that fools don’t love us
When the Himalayan snow,
Free clear air beneath, above ns,
White as peace, has shadows blue?
“Love,” I said, “though apes don’t love us,
I am happy kissing you ! ”
Oh, the race across creation,
’Planes that sigh and vanes that whir!
You were joy and revelation,
Heart aflame and pulse astir.
Oh, the race across creation
(Peking blinked at half-past two),
Joy that leaps to revelation—
God and night and I and you!
“If,” they said, “we catch ’em straightway,
There’ll be no great mischief done.”
Raced we down the purple gateway
Of the dawn into the sun.
Oh, they hoped to catch us straightway,
Ere we’d done what we would do ;
But we rushed the splendid gateway
One glad flesh, dear, I and you.
Farflung fields of dewy morning—
Omsk, the Caspian, Kandahar.
Police before us thundered warning,
But we know what lovers are!
Golden fields of blazing morning—
Cairo, desert, Timbuctoo—
Safe to shelter, ’spite their warning,
Safe for love and life with you!
Later in that gold December
(Tuesday ’twas, the twenty-third:
Date I always must remember.
Though my memory’s so absurd) —
Late in splendid deep December,
Nineteen hundred twenty-two,
First I guessed (do you remember?)
That I was in love with you.

“Sarg”: Astonishing is the faith some
people have in the resources 'of photography. A
canvasser fob enlargements doing the country—in
more senses than one —called at a sedate-looking-
homestead to try his luck. He found it occupied
by two maiden ladies. There had until recently-
been another occupant, brother John ; but he had
forsaken the flesh. The spinsters brought to light a
shiny postcard on which some enthusiast had im-
printed the features of the late John. At their
request the canvasser promised to have John’s hair
harrowed and John’s flannel replaced with a frock
coat and the twist in John’s proboscis adzed into a
decent shape. He was about to ask for the small
deposit required by the firm when one of the sisters
became slightly hysterical at the thought of the
defunct’s smelling apparatus being monkeyed with
by a perfect stranger. “ ’Tut-tut-tisn’t right,” she
sobbed, “to have pup-poor dear John's features
altered. We nun-know he couldn’t help the ram
bub-butting him; but if you turned him fuf-full
face it wouldn’t shuh-show so much.”
“Ground Floor”: The most sympathetic
magpie 1 know- was the pet of a family at Tea
(Vic.). A married daughter of the family came
up from Melbourne on a visit and brought with her
a kiddie aged three months, which took Maggie's
fancy. When the baby, whimpered Maggie, jumping
to the conclusion that it was hungry, went out to
forage. First the mother found a worm on the
infant’s lips, then a blowfly and finally' a centipede.
Till the departure of the indignant mother the not-
understood bird had to be lent to another branch of
the family.
* * * *
“Spook”: Here’s mine for “Mypharry,”
who wants home-made tobacco. Read “Coringa” (B.
16/12/’2O) as far as “add more treacle and a dash
of rum,” and then proceed as follows: Procure a piece
of (fin. x 2in. hardwood; stick a mortise Jin. sq.
through it. Screw bn one side a piece of 6in. x lin.
hardwood, and obtain a piece of ditto 3in. x 3in.
about Gin. long. Gently' insert and press down to
all corners of the mortise a small quantity of the
wet “weed” and ram with the block: this is best
done by hitting. Add more leaf and hit again; so
on until the plug’ is thick enough. Get a small
cramp, if possible, and press the block into the mor-
tise by attaching the cramp to the Gin. x lin. sole.
Take another turn of the screw as often as you see the
weed for a week or 10 days; unscrew then, and the
plug tobacco ds right. This doesn’t worry the tidy
missus, and makes a better job.
“Scottie Thrake”: Two bower-birds had a
most elaborate bower and playground near my camp
on Bluey’s Creek (N.Q.). The bower
was large, well-built and properly roofed.
The ground about it was cleared of all
rubbish and laid out in lanes and circles
with colored pebbles, shell, bits of tin,
glass and a thousand and one odds and
ends. They went through my camp two
or three times a day to see if there was
anything I had forgotten to put away,
and at last I was afraid to leave out any-
thing smaller than a kerosene-tin. It
was then I noticed that they never
touched anything made of brass. I was
in the habit of spending Saturday after-
noon under the bough-shed moulding bul-
lets and re-loading. The ground around
the table was littejpd with spent
detonators and shells tJhat I had dis-
carded. They were small and bright and
shiny enough to attract the attention of
any bird, but they were never touched.
I examined the bower and playground carefully,
but found no cartridge-case or any particle of brass.
» * * * *
“Bad Australian”: “Tropic Bird” (B.
23/12/’2O) may take it from me that the wedge-
tailed eagle is a lamb-killer. I have caught him in
the act on several occasions, and I have had indis-
putable evidence of his guilt on many more. Once,
on the Broken River (Vic.), I saw one of these
birds kill and carry off a turkey-hen, and on another
occasion, when I was stalking a “black” wallaby
which stood about 2ft. 6in. on its hams, a large
eagle swooped down. The marsupial fled for the
shelter of an adjacent patch of scrub. The bird
headed its victim off and battered it into a dazed
condition with repeated blows from its wings, and
finished the job by tearing a large hole in the
animal’s neck and shoulder, almost severing one of
the forepaws. My .44 closed the incident.
* * * *
“Topo”: I have been growing trees from
seeds for the past quarter-century, and doing it
without any failures. This is the recipe. Com-
mandeer the old jam-tins, and put them in fire to
melt out the solder. This will give you tin
cylinders. Tie a piece of string firmly around each;
fill with suitable earth, and plant four or five seeds
in each. When the seedlings come up pull out all
but the strongest one in each tin, and, when that
one is well established, plant the whole concern, tin
and all. And there you are. The treeling gets
to work in its mother earth; the rootlets are
undisturbed; the tin forms a watering funnel, and
moisture is retained where it is most needed. As
the trunk expands, the tin gives, for, remember,
the solder has gone.
HIS ARDUOUS TASK.
P.C. 49: “Get up and get out of this, you loafer!"
LYING LARRY: “Excuse yerself, Mr. P’liceman, I'm no loafer."
P.C. 49: “No loafer! And may I ask what you are busy doing notv?"
LYING LARRY: “I am airing my bedding.”
“Guide Post”: “Ivyogle” (B. 16/.12/’2O)
mentions ’roos in the Wilcannia district snuffing out
from no apparent cause. Years ago, in the far-
west of Queensland, I was up against the same
problem till my Binghi horse-tailer informed me “too
much plurry sandfly.” Later I found whole families
of ’roos dead or dying, in the same camp, and was
quite satisfied that the little pests were the assassins.
The ears seem to be the big fellows’ weak spot, and
the brain soon becomes a sandfly hive. Symptoms:
The patient is very sozzled in the early stage; this
is followed by complete breakdown of steering gear,
causing the victim to move in erratic circles when
disturbed. Rabbits and jumbucks are affected to a
lesser extent during exceptionally wet seasons.
* * * *
“Balfour”: Bundaburra Jacky had
tramped about 25 miles from a shearing-shed, and,
not having made a financial success of his job as
tar-boy, was very hard up for cash. On arrival at
Gilgandra he had therefore to use his head. Enter-
ing a bar he sidled up to the boss. “Good-
mornin’, Mr. Brady,” he said, “I jest want tell
yer there’s a dead dog in your yard.” “Oh, is
there?” replied the publican, and went out to inspect
it. “How much do you want to shift it, Jacky?”
he asked on his return. “Well, Mr. Brady, a
bottle of rum ’ll do.” Brady gave Jacky the job,
and so did nearly every other publican in the town.
Jacky was very drunk indeed when he got to Gil-
gandra’s last pub. “Good mornin’, Mr. Casey,” he
hiccupped. “I jest want tell yer there’s a dead
dog in your yard.” “A dead dog! In my yard!”
Casey replied. “Why, Jacky, that’s a dead dog you
are dragging behind you on a string.” Bundaburra
lurched round. “Sorry, Mr. Casey,” he groaned—
“suppose him plurry well follow me.”

“Eurah”: Can anybody give a trier any
information re the converting of sugar-beet into an
eatable syrup? I had a brain wave during the
sugar shortage and planted beet. Now I find I
have plenty material and no knowledge—a combina-
tion that doesn’t sweeten the duff.
“Billy T.”: The brothers Ham had fired
a huge stump in the side of the hill on their hold-
ing, about which a quantity of alluvial dirt had
deposited itself. The stump burned for a week, and
left a little cave, with walls so roasted they were
hard as cement. A few days later Jimmy Ham,
being in the vicinity, heard a curious sound coming
from the miniature cave, and observed that smoke
was drifting out again. He approached, and peer-
ing in discovered a swagman sitting on the floor
before a small fire, at which he was cooking a chop.
The swaggie was singing his best imitation of
“Home, Sweet Home.” Ham left the tenant in peace,
and saw next day that he had made an entrance to the
hole and fitted a bark verandah over it. Within a week,
being still undisturbed, the swagman accosted the
elder Ham. “Say, mate,” he said, “you don’t seem
to mind me makin’ myself comfortable in the cave
over there. I’m much obliged. It’s the first time
in five years I’ve had a bit of a crib. I was won-
derin’ if you’d mind if I brought the missus up
< rom Morwell.”
“Adweelan”: The two most astonished
fishermen I ever saw were anglers black-fishing lately
from the rocks adjacent to the metal wharf, Middle
Harbor, Pt. Jackson. They had been unsuccessful for
some time, and then a 501 b. or 601 b. jewfish landed
between them on the sloping rock on which they
were standing. Rods were promptly dropped, and
the jewie secured, and a couple of anglers wearing
well-satisfied smiles and Ikey bn a pole hit the
track for home. Surmised that a blind leap to evade
the attack of a shark had landed jewie literally on
the rocks. On the other hand, he may have been
■ threatened with a summons to appear as co-re. and
adopted this method of evading service.

“Bouragi”: From his list of “burial” cus-
toms among Papuans, “Wal” (B. 2/12/’2O) omits
one of some of the Gulf tribes. The dear departed
is put on a platform of split cane, about five feet
high, where the hot sun can get well at him. When
deliquescence l —as the chemists say—sets in, those
entitled to the high honor squat under the platform
and anoint themselves with the essences of their
late relative. Like house burial, however, this rite
has long been frowned on by the Government, and
has almost or quite passed away.
IT WAS THE ONLY ONE HE KNEW.
JUDGE: “What the—that is to say, what do
you mean b y bringing that bludgeon into
court?”
ACCUSED: “Well, I was told to have me
defence ready, your Honor.”
“Invalid”: Beat this? G. C. McMahon,
of Yalea (Vic.), rammed, filled and sewed 247 bags
of harvester wheat in a day. He worked 12hr.
45min., and I’ll admit that at the finish he didn’t
care whether the cow calved or broke her neck.

DELANEY'S VENDETTA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
2 his is the story told to me, in the midst, of the
desert's glare,
By Jack McCluskey as ire trudged on the track to
God-Knows- Where .
‘"So you never heard of Delaney’s chase through the
heart of the Lonely Lands,
Along the ‘Trickle’ and out. across the shimmering
seas of sand ?
ell, this is the way the thing began"—l wondered
at the pause—
“ Delaney murdered his wife because... .well, mur-
dered her because.
“Me murdered her so secretly in a place with eyes
so few
that why slii' died and how she died no other mortal
knew.
And then a great remorse set in, and Dill Delaney
swore
'! hat the man who killed his woman-mate would
live to kill no more.
“He swore that he would follow (and he laughed
with mirthless glee)
Follow the trail of vengeance till the end of eternity ;
Yes, follow on, unwearying, and careless of all the
woe
lhat comes to the man who dares to tramp the
land that the hatters know.
“And, swearing so, he rolled his swag—a big six-
shooter in
Its fold and a butcher’s knife, keen-edged, to carve
out a crimson sin;
And off he set on the long-long chase after the
man whose hate •
Had killed the woman who, right or wrong, was his
mate —his only mate.
“He chased from Bourke to Hungerford, and back
to Bourke again,
Then out .across the mulga belts and over the salt-
bush plain,
Then down .along the Darling track and out to
Broken Hill—
The only thought in his maddened brain to capture
and to kill!
A FAIR DEAL.
THE J.P.: “Now, then, Hogan, how is it
that a weak little malm like yez are
knocked this big sthrong copper down?”
HOGAN : It were t'rough drinkin’ a new
whisky Flaherty opened lasht noight.
It were terrible sthrong."
THE J.P. (in a hurry) : “Gintlemin, this
case is adjoorned until the Court has
proved the truth of his statemint.”
“Then north to far-off Barringun, and across the
‘Corner’ waste —■
And every mile he tramped sped up his hot ven-
detta’d haste.
The cheque-man’ at the shanties looked and saw
him swiftly pass,
Determined never to take a rest or a friendly, cheer-
ing glass.
He tiamped and tramped, and his hatred grow with
every mile he trod ;
He swore revenge by the faiths he held—revenge
by the living God!
The dog that slouched at his heels knocked up. and
a bullet in its brain
Made it a lifeless, yellow dot on the great grey,
glittering plain.
“But came a day when the quarry slowed in his
misery and fear,
And Delaney knew that at this long last avenging’s
hour was near.
A shot that shook the silences.... a small smoke-
curl that rose... .
A man that lay on the shining sand in undisturbed
repose.”
“I wonder now/’ McCluskey mused, “did Delaney
go to abide
With God as a ruthless murderer or only a suicidef”

How do you feel after the day’s work ?
Do you feel ready to put in half an hour or so in the garden or
some similar physical recreation? Do you feel like enjoying’the
appetising meal awaiting you? If not you need a tonic, a nourish-
ing mvigorator, such as CLEMENTS TONIC. Try it. You will
find that—
CLEMENTS TONIC “Puts the ‘Vital’ into Vitality.”
‘Sir Spen”: There is plenty of scope for
the production of movie thrills in the locality known
as the Watercourse, some 20 miles west of Moree
(N.S.W.). Here there are large numbers of wild!
pigs that would be ready to extend a sensational
reception to disturbers of their peace. Film direc-
tors would have little trouble in finding local men
to ‘ stunt” for them right up to the limit of reason-
able expectations—men who would look on the busi-
ness as only a slight variation of .their everyday
life. Old Man Kangaroo, an inoffensive chap after
all, has been driven across the screen long enough,
and, besides, ’roo drives are not very exciting at
the" best of times. What’s wrong with giving him
a spell for a while and screening something that
will cause Venus to momentarily forget her icecream
in the excitement of watching Adonis hunt the boar?
* * * *
“Chota”: In George-street, Sydney, ,1
noticed that Mr. Bang was a gunsmith. I mentally
complimented Mr. Bang on his apt choice of a pro-
fession, and have since in Queensland kept my
eyes open for similar coincidences. I have found
Bull, the butcher, at Pomona ; Potter, the gardener,
at Sandgate; Dow, the baker, at Rosewood; Schu-
maker, the bootmaker, at Cooran; Mrs. Ham, in a
South Brisbane ham-and-beef shop, and to-day I
happened on what I consider Queensland’s best so
far, i.e., Hope and Digweed, banana farmers.
*
“Zanthus”: The albatross beats the
carrier-pigeon out of sight as a long-distance flier.
In 1883 two boys playing on the beach near Fre-
mantle (W.A.) came across an outsize in dead
albatrosses. It was wearing a collar made out of
a meat-tin and had been choked by trying to swal-
low something too big for the collar. The kids
showed their find to their father, who found on the
collar scratchings in French to the following effect-
“ Thirteen shipwrecked men have taken refuge on
the Crozet Islands. Help us, for the love of God.”
There was also a date; it was a fortnight before
the find on the beach. When the incident was
advertised the captain of a vessel which had just
blown into Fremantle said that a big albatross had
adopted the ship near the Crozets and followed it
almost to port, living on scraps thrown over the
side. The Westralian authorities asked the com-
mander of the naval squadron to send a man-of-war
to the Crozets, but the reply was that he hadn’t
NO ONE-MAN JOB.
THE TAILOR: “’Ere, George, just ’op round
with this tape.”
a ship to spare for such a wild chase. However, a
cable message to Paris resulted in a French ship-
of-war being despatched to the Crozets right away,
but when she reached those wind-swept specks in
the far south it was too late. All that was found
was a message stating that the shipwrecked men
had made a raft and were going to try to get over
to - another island where they had hopes of finding
some tucker. They never reached it. Incidentally,
and naturally, these birds of the great distances
don’t do well in captivity. A while ago one of
them was caught in Sydney Harbor and taken to
the Zoo. He fretted for a few weeks and then died.
Two Seas : Of the wonderful intelligence
displayed by sheep-dogs in working sheep around the
course at show trials, old hands remark, “You don’t
have to teach them much. They imbibe their know-
ledge with their mother’s milk.” Here is a fact
that backs up that opinion. A well-bred slut of
the writer’s and a splendid worker in the paddock
FACE PRINTS.
PATRICK (who returned to find that somebody had chalked a donkey’s head an the hack
of his tame): Say, note, which of yes has been wiping his face on my clothes?"
picked up a poisoned lamb that' a fox had dropped
close to the homestead, and left a litter of kelpies
only four days old. It seemed hopeless to attempt
to rear them, but a little girl who had a genius for
rearing any bush orphan wearing wool, hair or
feathers begged to be given a chance to mother
the little blind mites, and so save them from the
bucket. Their squeaks for tucker never failed to
awaken- her four or five times during the night,
when she would warm fresh milk over a spirit-lamp
and feed them. How she got the milk into their
tiny mouths was a puzzle until she explained that
she squirted it in with a fountain-pen filler. In this
way the whole litter was successfully reared until
their eyes opened and they learned to drink from
a saucer. Their little foster-mother was naturally
veiy proud, but her patience and perseverance were
ill-rewarded, for in spite of the fact that they were
descended from a long strain of clever workers and
looked good enough to exhibit anywhere, not one
of the pups ever showed the slightest interest in
working sheep. There appeared no other way of
accounting for this indifference except that they
were reared on cow’s milk instead of on their mother,
and as sheep-dogs they certainly were what any
bushman would call “fair cows.”
*
“Eddyson” : We were out from Peabody on
a shooting expedition, shooting anything from toad-
stools to red deer, and We struck two succeeding
days 107 deg. in the shade and something incalculable
in the sun. Borne down by our impedimenta we
came out upon Dougal Macdougal’s place at Lower
Lang. Dougal gave us much milk to drink, and
allowed us the range of his fine orehard. Under
a tree at a little distance we descried a scarecrow
in a sitting position, in its hands a gun. “But
crows don’t eat your fruit?” said I. “Hon,” said
Macdougal, “Lower Lang crows will eat onything ”
“And why the gun?” said Peters. “The crows o’
Lower Lang dinna give tuppence for a. mon wi’out
a gun,” explained Macdougal. “But,” said Peters,
“if they are wise enough to know it is a gun, they
are wise enough to know it is not a man.” “Aye,
mon,” said Macdougal, “the crows o’ Lower Lang
are verra wise birrds. I ha’ yet ta meet a chiel
fra Melbourne as wise as a crow o’ Lower Lang.”
Just then the scarecrow arose and shifted his posi-
tion to the sha'de of another free.
* * * .*
“Pick”: The eagles that nest in the lone-
some mountain fastnesses under the shade of
Koscuisko (N.S.W.) are more deadly on young stock
than those of any other part of Australia. One
of the Moonbar station stockmen has a plan of his
own for dealing with the ravagers. Out on the plains
he pegs down loosely an old rug or blue blanket with
iTn Sklnned rabbit or fastened to the middle.
When an eagle walks on the blanket to approach
the banquet, his long, hooked rear talons catch in
the fabric, and in his frantic endeavors to free them
he rolls himself up and is held securely. When two
eagles walk on together there is something really-
doing. Each blames the other for pulling the table-
cloth awry, and only shreds of poultry remain when
the trapper calls around.
Orwell : The cares of the conventional
bridegroom are trifling compared with the trouble
taken by Mr. Binghi of North Westralia to please
his unblushing bride. His hair is bound tightly
round the head till it comes to a point. Into it
is rubbed a paste of powdered red chalk and grease.
Black and white cockatoo feathers are inserted and
the decorative scheme is finished off by plantin-
in the mound a three-inch stick with more feathers
on the end of it. Around the neck he places a
necklace (or several necklaces) of small shells. Only
old men are allowed to marry. The bride is about
o and has generally been engaged since she was
born. A tertium quid, who forcibly helps himself
is pursued by the one entitled to the lady. ■ A fight
takes place and the winner drags the prize home,
bhe doesn’t seem ever to mind which way it goes.
* * *
“T. Weed” : I was out on patrol in Papua.
The silence of the forest was deafening, madden-
ing, and I persuaded Lance-Corporal Eki, who had
known the white man six years, to
come into my tent arid yarn with me.
I was a magistrate, and the penalty
for giving a native liquor was a large
one, but I strolled outside every time
I filled my own pannikin, leaving
another within reach, also the whisky-
bottle uncorked. That night I got
more insight into the native mind
than in all the rest of the time I
spent in the country. „ Eki told me
one thing that I have often pondered
over since. There was, he said, a
shrub growing in the bush known
only to the women. When they wanted
to avoid the penalties of motherhood
they collected the leaves of the plant
and dried it. Drunk of smoked the
result was the same—abortion. Eki
offered to get his wife to procure me
a sample, but froze on it the next day
when the whisky bottle was out of
sight. Is this plant known to our
medical men? I swear Eki was not sophisticated
enough to pull my leg in such a matter.

Jim Carew”: The moon is responsible for
some queer bush superstitions. He“e T few
f food, especially fish, is exposed to the ihoonlight,
it becomes poisonous. If timber .is felled at full
moon it decays in about half the ordinary time If
a man sleeps where the moonlight falls on his eyes,
he will go blind. If a saw or other steel tooi is
exposed to the moonlight, it loses temper. If the
ends °f a crescent moon point upwards it means rain.

scientific basis for them? Some are almost universal.

Pll! ° w and face ' In his excitement he forgot
that the face was underneath the alleged snake, which
turned out to be the shadow of a branch cast through
the open end of the fly by a setting moon.

‘'Fred Teale”: “Barcoo” (B. 30/12/’2O)
is wrong: Skuthorpe invariably used a saddle with
a sharpiy-cut kneepad and also a very serviceable
squarely-cut pad under the thigh. When the Mar-
tim buck jumping boofn was at its height in Sydnev
about 10 years ago there was much wrangling because
Skuthorpe insisted on his right to use this saddle
in his attempt to ride the hitherto invincible Bobs
in response to Martini’s challenge. He rode the
horse to a standstill, and brought a thrilling per-
formance to a sensational close by throwing the
reins over the animal’s head, and with the fingers
of each hand extended from his nose made rude
remarks about the bucking ability of Martini’s cham-
pion Immediately afterwards Billy Waite mounted
Skuthorpe’s terror, Yellow Jack, in a poley saddle
and, presumably to get square with his rival gave
the horse a thorough doing with the whip. Of
Martini’s team, although Waite, a Queensland abori-
ginal, was the star performer, the brothers Dempsey,
Arthur and Jack, were great horsemen, the former
being a balance-rider, who disdained the use of
stirrups even on the toughest propositions.

stands sullen and resigned in a trap, or a
couple of mammoths are affectionately rub-
bing tusks. Kipling could hardly have seen
these later discoveries when he wrote “The
Story of Ung,” yet he describes the mammoth
in a line, “The mountainous mammoth, hairy,
abhorrent, alone,” though the last adjective
is evidently not accurate. One also
gathers from the drawings that the mam-
moth was probably a kindly beast, and that
the cave-man rather liked him than other-
wise, especially to eat. The eyes are drawn
too large; no doubt when the artist was run-
ning from an angry mammoth he got an im-
pression of two great flaming things like
motor-car headlights. But “mountainous” is
a perfect adjective, with the beast’s great
bulgy head and stubborn thick legs; and
there is certainly a terrifying hairiness about
him in the drawings. One would like to
imagine that the cave-man made these won-
derful pictures because he had to, or burst;
but it is more likely that the idea of witch-
craft had a good deal to do with it. “You wish
to kill a mammoth? Of course; why not? I
will draw his picture and bewitch him, and
a dinner for the tribe will thereby fall into
your trap.” Our own blackfellows do just
the same to this day, and their state of
culture is much that of the cave-men, with-
out of course any indication of artistic per-
ception. But even so these old witch-doctors
must have had souls above the mere lust for
mammoth-meat; no man could have done
these remarkable little pictures unless he had
felt an urgent need for self-expression. They
lived during the time when Europe was
awakening from its half-million years’ sleep
under the ice, following, at what interval of
time it is impossible to say, the horrible
savages of Neanderthal and Spy. They came
from no-one knows where, and they vanished
no-one knows whither. After them, exclud-
ing details, there comes an interval of 20,000
to 50,000 years of which we know nothing;
and the curtain next rises upon the prosaic
flint-polishing Neolithic direct ancestors of
modern Europe, who lived in houses but were
artistically Philistines. The fate of the
great palaeolithic etchers is one of_ the most
profound mysteries of science. I.t is thought
that they had nothing whatever to do with
modern Europe, yet it is difficult to believe
that such a race could not have held its own
against any that came to compete with it;
and one imagines that Norman Lindsay must
have a drop of the ancient blood in him. It
is remarkable that France is still the home
of Art. Can it be possible that the old
artists were so busy with self-expression that
they did not trouble to take heed for bread
and butter? It was not the last time that
the artist succumbed to the bourgeois.
In spite of “The Story of Ung,” the cave-
man was a very bad draughtsman of the
human form, possibly because he had no
cannibalistic designs to spur him on, but
there are several curious pictures of dancing
women with flounced and tight-waisted
dresses in which they look weirdly modern;
but on the whole the witch-doctors reserved
their genius for depicting animals.
There is a large number of essays in the
volume, on Species, Vesuvius, Hybrids and
other interesting subjects. Lankester’s
prose-style has not the exquisite clarity of
Huxley’s; indeed, it is often a little clumsy.
But it will suffice, and the book is one to be
bought, not borrowed.

Women Who Didn’t Stay
The woman writer appears to age very
quickly in public estimation. Six or seven
women in all seem to maintain themselves
in English literature and refuse to grow old;
but the rest fade fast and far out of re-
membrance. They got an early start, too,
for Juliana Burners orßarnes was born about
1388. She was Prioress of Sop well Nunnery
and wrote on sporting matters so well that
her “Boke of St. Albans” got into print in
1486. We are apt to think of the woman
novelist and poet as products of the modern
movements for higher education, but such is
not the case. Women were successful novel-
ists and playwrights in the 17th century; in
fact, about as far back as popular success
has been possible. Mrs. Eliza Haywood was
born in 1693 and both wrote and acted plays
that were the rage of a season or two. She
published novels, secret histories of a satirical
sort, and led an attack on Alexander Pope,
for which he put her in the “Dunciad.”
Rather a dazzling lady in every way, she
published “The Female Spectator” and
ruffled it in letters with the best of the men,
but passed utterly out of memory in a genera-
tion. A little later there was Fielding’s
sister, Sarah, writing attractive novels and
translating Xenophon. She died in 1768 and
faded immediately. Susanna Blamire, called
“the Muse of Cumberland,” was born in
1747 and had a repute which lasted until
1842, when her works were collected—and
forgotten. Elizabeth Montagu was one of
the chief critics of her day, and in 1769
published a defence of Shakspeare against all
comers. Catherine Macaulay between 1763
and 1783 published a History of England in
eight volumes. Horace Walpole said it was
better than Hume —which wouldn’t be. diffi-
cult. It had enormous popularity for a
minute or two. Sophia and Harriet Lee were
born respectively in 1750 and 1757. They
wrote a lot of novels and dramas which were
thought big stuff by people like Byron. Maria
Edgeworth was born in 1767 and has some
sort of place still; but remember that
Walter Scott began to write fiction in the
hope that his Scotch stories might equal
Maria’s Irish ones, and you get some idea of
the height from which she has fallen. In the
midst of all the brilliancy of the fiction
which poured from women’s pens at the be-
ginning of the 19th century, Jane Austen
published a few unpretentious books anony-
mously. Critics thought her work ? ot bad at
all, and a few readers really liked it; and so
Jane died of consumption in 1817, leaving
behind her a little light that grew and grew
into a great glory. Lady Caroline Lamb
wrote three novels between 1816 and
which attracted much attention. Caroline
had been in love with Byron and caricatured
him in “Glenarvon.” In 1824 she happened
by chance to meet the hearse which contained
Bryon’s body, and immediately swooned.
Although she lived four years more her
mind never recovered from the shock. 4he
tragic incident might have been enough to
hold a little public interest, especially as her
husband afterwards became Prime Minister;
but she was forgotten quickly and well.
Mary Wollstonecraft married Godwin in the
last year of her life, 1797, and died giving
birth to the child who became Shelley s
second wife. She was a centre of literary
sensation once. She vt’rote a “Vindication of
the Rights of Women,” a reply to Burke on
the French Revolution, and a book of stories
for children which Blake illustrated. The
names of scores of women of short-lived fame
who wrote between 1800 and 1850 could
easily be added. To give a reason for the
rapidity with which their names have faded
out would not always be easy; but the facts
are beyond dispute. On their way to oblivion
they have lots of male companions—men once
famous enough to be worthy to carry their
books of press cuttings—but the kings have
not been as swiftly nor as easily dethroned as
the queens. It is all very sad; but Elsie
and Sissie already heap scorn on Marie
Corelli, and Elinor Glyn is with the hot days
of the summer before last.
P. O. M.
St. Henry of Scotland
When Henry Drummond died at a com-
paratively early age all Scotland mourned.
His loss seemed hardly less than that of
Ii.L.S. himself, though his force was not so
greatly felt south of the Cheviot Hills. He
was a strange paradox: a professor with a
turn for saving souls; a scientist with a real
literary gift and a tendency to make facts
fit theories; a theologian with hardly any
respect for authority; an evangelist with a
contempt for orthodoxy; a man of great
earnestness with a sense of humor.
Nothing that he wrote has very lasting
quality; yet every line is full of freshness
and thought. In “Natural Law in the
Spiritual World” h'e set out to show that
a broad sort of Calvinism exactly fitted the
modern scientific theories of growth and
development; he succeeded in persuading the
churches that they could drop their open
hostility to Darwinism. In “The Ascent, of
Man” he wrote a prose poefn of evolution
in which he sought to trace love as the
motive power of all progress; he succeeded
in making a delightful book and landing the
inquiring mind in logical chaos. In his
big work on Africa he mixed brilliant obser-
vation with hearsay inaccuracies. Some of
his little pamphlets—notably “The Greatest
Thing in the World” —sold in half-millions ;
and while he was lecturing at Glasgow he
was preaching in season and out. He died
jesting; and two of his chief literary friends
who had known him for years could not
remember one fault of speech or deed in all
his career. Moody, of Chicago, with
Sankey, had a great beating-up of souls in
England and Scotland, and Drummond
helped them with strange enthusiasm. Then
a deputation of the shocked faithful came
to Moody and asked him to dissociate him-
self from one so heretical in his opinions as
Drummond. Moody gave the characteristic
reply: “Wal, gentlemen, I hev laid this
matter before the Loard; and the Loard has
revealed unto me that Professor Drummond
is a better man than I am. Good day.”
Drummond was a strange adventurer. He
dared greatly in a comparatively narrow
sphere; he wrote of science and religion
with a touch of romance; he lifted a barren
theology into poetry. I think he might
have been one of the greatest had he chosen
Literature instead of Science for his mistress;
but I am not sure that his practical desire
to help people round him —and help them at
once —would not have frittered away any
effort, however high in aim.

Fetters and Other Verses> by M. y
d Mullen Melbourne). Gentle verse,
lowing some skill, but little clarity or originality
0{ thought The two longest pieces are in a blank
verse which goes heavily. None of the lines have
much singing quality.
Guide to Carlyle, by Augustus Ralli (George Allen
and Unwin). This is a comprehensive critical bio-
graphy with a careful analysis of all Carlyle s work,
| x- j nte nded primarily for students, but there is
" ]at to intere st the general reader. There is a
not too convincing attempt to dissociate Carlyle
from Germanism; and the man behind the writings
is made to look a good deal more pleasing than he
appeared in Froude’s picture. i n ™ a n V
worth while. Carlyle has still a nrm to np m ma y
j th ough t he old extravagant claim of supreme
grea tness would be urged by very few of his fol-
lowers. His philosophy is lumbering; his history
fails in the first necessary quality of accuracy; all
bis work is marred by an intellectual conceit which
* leads to posing and prosing; his style is often a
thing to throw bricks at; but there is still a lot
over. He said those rude, smart, vital things which
are like Shawisms grown up to full mental stature;
and with all his posings he was a poet. There are
bits of his work that stir the blood like the sonnets
of Milton and pages that splash in great soul-color
like Tennyson at his best. The author of this
“Guide” does not quite see that; but he labors to
do justice and mercy, and the book is a monument
of patient zeal.
“Gentlemen—the King,” by John Oxenham
(Methuen). Another volume of infinitely tedious
verse from a prolific writer who has little to say
and little skill in saying it. The lines just run on
in fairly even scansion, saying the old things in the
old way with never a lift nor hint of inspiration.
Southern Seas Story Boyle, edited by Lillian M.
Pyke (Alexander McCubbin, Melbourne). On the
title-page Henry Stead is described as “general
editor,” which suggests that this is one of a series.
The book consists of a large assortment of excellent
stories for youngsters, with good illustrations.
“Zoo” Studies from Nature, compiled by James Tay-
lor (James Taylor, Sydney). Animal pictures from
photographs, accompanied by a brief account of the
more important inhabitants of the Sydney Zoo. The
more or less open system of keeping wild beasts has
enabled the photographer to get the lions, tigers and
bears in the most convincingly natural attitudes, and
the reproductions are excellent. .
Mary Ann, by George Mozart (T. Werner Laurie).
A tale of stage life full of crudities. The mixture
of piety and absurdity culminates in a murder which
is proved in the end to have been committed by the
most decent person in the book.
Dick Lester, of Kurrafong, by Mary Grant Bruce
(Ward, Lock). A Westralian yarn of adventure which
boys will read with zest. The color is better than
in most books of the kind.
Misfits, by Sybil Campbell Lethbridge (Skeffing-
ton, London). Rather a tedious yarn about the love
affairs of uninteresting people. The events of the
book are not startling, neither is the writing nor the
characterisation.
Bruce at Boonderong Camp, by Lillian M. Pyke
(Ward, Lock). A vigorously-told Australian yarn
that will hold a boy’s attention.
The Ivory Gate, by Marjorie Barnard, illustrated by
Leyshon White (H. H. Champion, Melbourne).
Good little stories about fairies, toys and real boys
and girls. The writer is obviously very young,
but to make up for a little lack of skill there is a
pleasant freshness. The book is finely produced,
and should make a useful gift-book for the kiddies,
though one or two of the yarns may keep for
reading a few years later.
Golf Architecture, by Dr. A. Mackenzie (Simpkin,
Marshall). A little book about setting out golf
courses and keeping greens. The papers are helped
out by' 22 illustrations. The author’s idea is to
preserve natural beauties, so that the game may be
played under the most pleasant conditions.
Parramatta District Soldiers in the Great War
(Cumberland Argus, Parramatta). Hundreds of
portraits of soldiers are here reproduced, making a
record of which the old N. S. Wales town may well
be proud. There are several articles on war sub-
jects; and Capt. Stacy Waddy, R. B. Orchard and
Joseph Cook contribute commonplaces.
The Sinister Bevel, by Lillian Barrett (Knoff,
New York). This page can understand a Society
for the Propagation of Bolshevism publishing this
rubbish; but can’t understand anybody else doing
it It purports to be a story of the wild extrava-
gances of a weak son of a N. York multi-millionaire.
Diligent search fails to find in it a redeeming feature.
Mushroom Land, by Aileen Skinner (Skiffington
and Son, London). A pleasing little tale for young
children with some sort of slender scientific back-
ground. In a note you learn that Polyporus squa-
mosus grows to a circumference of 7ft. sin.;
also that the paving-stones of Basingstoke were lifted
by toadstools. The book is charmingly illustrated
by Violet Skinner.
“Me,” a Page from My Diary, words and pictures
by Esther Paterson (Alexander McCubbin, Melbourne).
A booklet of amusing drawings depicting the life of
an Australian schoolgirl. There is genuine fun
here; and as a remembrance to distant friends the
big sisters of “Me” could ask for nothing better.
The Inky Way
“E.A.D.”: “D.M.W.” (R.P. 25/11/’2O) mentions
that “The Book of Kells” was returned from a book-
binder’s minus some margins. He does not, how-
ever, state that the book is plus the signature of
Queen Victoria, a fact which the Library Assistant
at Trinity College, Dublin, keeps well in the back-
ground. I don’t know the circumstances of the
signing, but it suggests the tourist who delights to
engrave his name on trees or public buildings. For
the benefit of those Sydney people whose interest may
have been awakened to the wonders of the Book, it
may be borrowed (Sullivan’s edition) from the Muni-
cipal Library.
“R. 8.”: I had convinced myself that the war
would make “literature” more virile and direct, but
it doesn’t happen in England. The English maga-
ine, in the mass, was never literature, and the war
hasn’t changed it. The worst sign is the return
of the imitation of the story of the red-haired com-
mercial traveller who is mistaken for the King of
Barataria —the artificial thing made fashionable by
Anthony Hope in “The Prisoner of Zenda.” A recent
maga. published in London has a yarn of this
sort, and again the English traveller is the hero
because he is mistaken for the Prince of a German
principality. Not so unnatural a mistake either.
In the end he is killed, according to formula, and
the Graf, von Zuheim and old Colonel Liebwurst weep
over His Remains as they Lie in State. During the
war these magazines banned stories of kings and
princes, and told of privates rising to be field-marshals
and bombardiers becoming generals. But as soon
as the trouble was over “literature” returned to its
vomit, and Mary Ann reads of barons (always mid-
European) and countesses as avidly in 1920 as she
did in 1913. Dull people they are, strangely enough
without temperament, although, like the tempera-
mental, they never learn from experience.
Alex. Montgomery on our ABC: —
The learning of new names for the letters of
the alphabet is, in spite of S. Talbot Smith (R.P.
9/12/’2O), not worth the trouble of unlearning
the old. It is the same with pronunciation in
general. All languages suffer more or less from
homophony and polyphony—having one sound for
various spellings, and various sounds for one spell-
ing. The “fonetik” systems get rid of this
anomaly, but they do not cateh-on. Even the
American approach to a less cumbersome spelling
has no vogue outside the U.S. Once more, it is
not what we should have to learn that deters us ;
it is what we should have to get rid of. As for
the letter-names, it is futile to call them absurd.
Concordant with no rule they may be, but they
adequately serve their purpose; and, when that
is said, all is said. “What a thing is called is
not what it is.” But when you say what anything
is—as distinguished from the name given to it—
you are yourself merely giving it another name.
Again: “Its name is certainly the symbol A, and
what you call it depends upon,” etc. Nonsense!
What you call it is its name, as far as you are
concerned.

“Wang” on certain hardware: —
“Gas Burner” (B. 23/12/’2O) “kicked hard” when
asked by the Brighton (Vic.) Gas Go. to pay
£7 7s. for a second-hand stove. He (or she) states
that the Metro. Gas Co. sells a good Australian-made
stove for £6, new. The Brighton Co. does, too,
and will sell him (or her) one to-morrow at that
price: the same firm makes both-cos.’ stoves. “G. 8.”
was asked £7 7s. for a second-hand article—presum-
ably, from the tone of his par., an imported one.
Exactly so; and if “G. 8.” had asked the Metro. Co.
the same question he’d have been quoted the same
figure, if not more. Why? Because, despite the
effort “G. 8.” makes to appear as a barracker for
Aussie-made goods, inquiry was obviously made for
an English-made stove, and was met with the reply
quoted by him. 1 know what I’m talking about
here; I’m dealing with “Gas Burners” every day,
most of them Australian born, and their first pick
is usually an English stove —second-hand at that,
as there are no new ones coming to hand these times.
While patriotic (?) Australians hanker after im-
ported stoves they’ll get them, and pay for them.

The local committee of the Woollen In-
dustry in Queensland is looking into the
possibilities of establishing a milling centre
at Roma in view of the probability of a cheap
source of power from natural gas being avail-
able shortly. Even if no oil is found there
the gas, after it has had its petrol contents
absorbed, constitutes a valuable power gas
and illuminant, and it is really the problem
of how to use this residual gas without
wastage that is holding the hand of the
Mines Department from tackling the
absorption of petrol straight away.

The former swamps alongside Port

already has the new Poole and Steel venture.
This co., headed by A. H. Poole, formerly of
Sydney, and before that of M.L., is building
four 6000-ton cargo-boats to the order of the
Commonwealth Government. The first is to
be ready in three months, and the second is

A remarkable slump in land values has
taken place in p/rts of N. S. Wales.
The catastrophe dates from the Great
Storm. Before it arrived hundreds of beach
allotments—more particularly near Sydney
—were on offer at prices such as £3 and £4
per foot, and were selling fairly well at that.
The storm was a nark. Wherever a
beach faced south-east (the quarter
from which practically all the big gales
come) the sand blew up and overwhelmed
the adjacent landscape. Gardens disap-
peared ; fences went down or were
lost altogether; even houses were threat-
ened. Many cottages on many beaches
are now surrounded on three sides by
hundreds of tons of sand, and their owners’
one hope of salvation consists in persuading
someone to buy and build on the allotment
to windward. Surfing enthusiasts who
would previously have rushed the bargain-
sale propositions which are being laid before
them now draw back as if from gold-bricks.
There is no longer any discernible land for
sale, only sand; and sand, once it begins
to move away from the seashore, is the
devil.

You got no chance! There’s mor’n 300

SIMPLE SISTER GOES TO SYDNEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Flo resolved to go to town from brothers three
a yell went up,
Predicting ruin and distress. Bill in his horror
dropped a cup.
“Gorstruth!” he said, “in Sydney there what is a
simple girl to do?
They took me down. I lost me watch and seven
quid. What ’ope for you?”
Ben turned on her in pale dismay. “Look here, me
girl, ain’t you bin told
How one iv them there spieler blokes done me for
twenty pound in gold?
He was as nice a gentleman as any in the blessed
shops:
He got away with all I had, and took a luner at
the cops.”
“Me, too,” said Dave, “that time I went to Sydney
town to see the Show
One trimmed me for me bran’ new suit. You stay
where we can watch you, Flo.”
Flo packed. “If spieler comes at me his finish will
be sharp,” she said;
And when the boys next heard of her she’d got a
bloke, and then was wed.
She wrote: “He’s rather nice, I think, and I am
putting him to work.
Next Chrissmiss we are cornin’ up to see yous people
back o’ Bourke.”
And when he came he brought for Bill a Silver
watch and seven quid,
For Dave a bran’ new suit of check, a ruby tie-pin
and a lid.
To Ben he handed twenty pounds, in nice new minted
sovereigns, too.
And still the brothers gaped at him, and still their
great amazement grew.
He was a natty kind of chap, with gentle manners,
small and slim.
And when they spoke ’twas as one man. “So ’elp
me cat,” they said, “it’s ’im!”

COMSTOCK’S “DEAD-SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC FOR
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick the nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and is of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm,
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm.
Young people are more subject to these
worms than middle-aged or elderly people.
They live in the bowels, and sometimes make
their way into the stomach and throat, caus-
ing sickness, vomiting and choking. Gener-
ally one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also
found. The first thing to do is to rid the
system of the worms, and Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according to
directions, are an effective remedy for the
thorough eradication of the long round or
stomach worm —the common enemy of the
child, the youth, the middle-aged and aged.
A light, nourishing diet, out-of-door exercise,
and, if possible, a change of air will greatly
improve the general health.
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixth of an inch to half-
an-inch in length, and resemble cotton
thread —they are sometimes called seat
worms, and reside in the lower bowel. The
chief symptoms of this worm are severe
local itching, restlessness and irritability, a
frequent desire to urinate, and picking at the
nose; loss of appetite and ansemia are also
observed. To get rid of the worms and their
eggs their nests also must be removed, and
that requires a specific remedy. Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according
to directions on an empty stomach, followed
by a dose of opening medicine, will succeed
where others fail.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are packed with full directions, and are for
sale by chemists and stores generally, at
3s. 6d. per packet, or six packets for 205.,
and if unobtainable locally will be mailed
post free on receipt of price. Prepared only

Electric Hoists
and Runways.
NO system of cranes can approach the
convenience, speed and economy
of the Morris Overhead Electric
Runway in feeding departments, and dis-
charging their production. The Runway
links up every department in a wonderful
way—it gets into places where a crane is
impossible. As your departments extend
you can extend or alter your Runway and
adapt it to new needs.
Whatever the difficulties of transporting
goods in stores, warehouses, factories,
mines, etc., indoor or outdoor, there is a
Morris Runway that will overcome every
obstacle. Herbert Morris Runways can be
controlled from the cage, from the floor or
from any point. The greatest workshops
in the world use Morris Runway Systems
because they overcome the high cost of
labor.
We shall be pleased to supply estimates for
a Morris Runway installation for your
business. Also for Overhead Cranes (hand
or electric), Wall Cranes, Electric Hoists,
Spur Gear, Worm Gear and Gravity Lower-
ing Blocks, and the celebrated Morris
Triple-geared Pulley Block, the most
efficient and reliable block on the market-

“Kapina” : A man from Pt. Darwin, land-
ing- at Thursday Island, entered the local
plumbing works and asked for a job. There
was nothing doing. Undaunted, he asked
whether there were not tanks to be made.
He was tolcLthe local reservoir supplied the
town, and the island did not require tanks.
“You shouldn’t let a little thing like that
worry you,” said the apostle of the 'new
darkness. “When work is slack in Darwin
we blow up the pipes.”
“Dido”: There were five of us. We had
been to see the Test match and were break-
ing up the party in Swanston-street at about
half-past six, when he intruded. He was
not known to any of us, and was what the
good press describes as a deplorable object.
Furthermore, he was not obtrusively sober.
“Good day, gents, good day,” he said. “Do
you know where a man can get a drink?”
“Better try Blank’s back bar. Get in from
the right-of-way,” said one of us. The
stranger shook his head dolefully. “No
good,” said he, “I’ve tried. You’ve got to
pay for them there.”
“S.S.”: When I looked over the back
fence I discovered McTavish sitting on his
wood-heap with something across his arm
which I presently perceived to be a gun.
“Hello!” I said, “somebody been lifting your
box blocks?” Mack shook his head. “Nae-
thin’ o’ the like,” said he. “It’s yon twa
cats. Since yesterday’s morn they’ve taken
five o’ ma cheekins.” “Well,” said I, “now
is your chance while they are on the fence.”
“Ah’m in no’ sic a hurry,” answered McTav-
ish. “ ’Twill do verra weel a leetle later.
Ah’m weeshful o’ usin’ the same twa shots
to celebrate the cornin’ o’ the New Year.”
“D. Finis” : One of the oldest passenger-
liners in the Australia-Capetown-Britain
run, the Aberdeen White Star liner Mara-
thon, is on her last trip from Australian
ports to the Cold Country. After 15 years’
service .she has been sold to the Royal Mail
Co., and will go into the West Indian trade,
carrying bananas and other things from
Jamaica to Bristol. The Marathon, now an
8000-ton vessel, has grown since Australia
first saw her. A few years ago she was cut
in two, lengthened by about 50ft. and given
an extra funnel. During the war she
ploughed the wave in the submarine zone and
acquired some weird cubist designs by way
of camouflage.
Melbourne City Council is putting its
back up against the proposal favored by the
Railway Commissioners, the V.R.C. and the
R.A.S. to shift the saleyards from New-
market to a site close to Sunshine. As
the abattoirs, boiling-down establishments
and noxious trades generally would have
to go, too, a round million would be needed,
the Town Hall estimates, to bring about
the reform. A Commission, of which Gil-
ruth was a member —that was before, he
went to the Northern Territory—inquired
into carrying off the smell trades, and it
recommended Laverton as the ideal spot.
Another Commission told the Goverhment
how it could get water, power and traction
for Laverton. Of course nothing was done.
That the commissioners went to the trouble
of finding out what was possible was only
a further instance of hope triumphing over
experience.
“Jarrah”: Who doesn’t remember Law-
son’s dream-picture of the shearing-shed
“where every one of the rouseabouts was a
girl dressed up as a man,” and where ever)
night by the billabong all hands footed it
to the strains of a German band? lak e
away the sauer-kraut and Henry’s pleasant
fancy will be fact yet. A Westralian
paper records that Munbinia station, on
the Murchison, is now owned by a lady, an
the shearing was a pleasant run from star
fo finish. “All —employers and employed .
were a happy family. Musical evenings ana
surprise parties whiled away leisure time.
This is as it should be.” Decidedly s .
The A.W.U. Conference will doubtless see
to it that musical evenings and surprise
parties are added to its irreducible mm-
mum. I foresee the time when every st -
tion will have to provide a jazz band an
a supply of brisk young partners tor tn
gents who pull the wool off the sheep»
backs, as part of what Bill Lambert c
“the full policy terms.”
THE DUTIFUL UNIONIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It will be an unpleasant surprise to those who
have been thrown out of work owing to the shipping
strike to be told that many of the stewards hav!
found profitable employment. They have found
congenial tasks in hotels, boarding-houses and race
course booths.”— Argus.
I joyfully pictured the stewards who struck on their
uppers;
Imagined them haggard and desperate, looking for
jobs.
I smiled as I thought of their progeny seeking their
suppers
And, hearing they had to go hungry, dissolving in
sobs.
“It’s a judgment,” I mused,
“On those men who’ve refused
To valet and wait on their betters at sea.
They nauseate well-behaved workers like me.”
Alas for the ultimate good of the right-thinking
classes!
The traitors were speedily loaded with offers of
toil.
The restaurant-keepers and publicans rushed them in
masses;
Their women and children (and this is what makes
my blood boil)
Lived as well as before—
A fact all must deplore,
Whoever they ,are and wherever they be.
At any rate, that’s how the matter strikes me.
The typical workingman cheers when he hears that
his fellows
Are driven to sleeping in outhouses, stables and
mews ;
With gratified laughter the unionist noisily bellows
When unionists fail in their efforts to add to their
screws.
The observant all know
The foregoing is so:
So, of course, does that journal which never may
lie— .
The Argus. And so (I do not think) do I.

Ia his younger days at the Bar Irvine,
C. J., brought out a guide for J’s.P. Now Quick
of Bendigo, one of the framers of the Federal
Constitution and ex-P.M.G., is collaborating
with Berriman, P.M., in a similar work.
The late Dr. George Brown, many years a
Melanesian missionary, had a valuable col-
lection of Island curios. In his will he
directed that the collection should be first
offered to the Bowes Museum in Durham.
The trustees agreed to pay the moderate
price asked, and the collection is now on
the water. Dr. Brown was born in Durham.
Though ordinary creditors may have to
wait months and crawl through entangle-
ments of i’ed tape, Vic. Assembly members
are already drawing their extra £2OO a year.
Until George V. agrees to the Constitution
(Screws’ Increase) Bill, which has been
mailed to the Colonial Office, the measure is
not law; but payments are made on the nail
and debited to Treasurer’s Advance, it seems.
Two of Sydney’s oldest wine and spirit
firms, Harbottle, Alsop and Co. and Brown
and Co., have joined forces. They both
started business in the ’fifties. Francis
Bligh, senior director of the amalgamation,
is president of the Liquor Trades Defence
Union and a director of Tooth and Co., and
claims kinship with Bligh of the Bounty.
George Wyld and It. W. Leibinger are the
other principals.
Jim Beckett, at different times rounds-
man on the Age and Protector of Abos. in
the Territory, is pushing on with his
pioneering of Vanderlin Island, in the Gulf
of Carpentaria. He has bought a couple of
luggers to keep up communications with
Thursday Island, and besides growing tropi-
cal products is going to try sheep. Anyway,
he has purchased what is left of the Com-
monwealth sheep flock at Mataranka.
To a very limitjed extent the recommenda-
tions of the Dickson (Prison Reform)
Board are to be carried out in Victoria. A
whole-time inspector-general in place of Free-
man (who is partly inspector-general and
partly sheriff) is to be selected, and civil
servants will get the first chance of the job,
which is worth £6OO a year. If none of the
public-service applicants are up to the mark,
Major Conder may be brought in. Pentridge
is also to have a fresh governor, vice McDon-
ald, who has passed the 65th post.
A spirit of ape-like malice and cruelty
manifests itself now and then on the local
seas, and some people trace it to the teachings
of imported mischief-makers. One result
happened on the s.s. Paringa in S.A. waters.
There was -a special Christinas dinner for the
crew. The firemen demanded a duplicate
dinner the day after. Then they demanded
that the harmless, necessary cook should be
sacked and victimised for not having the gift
of prophecy and foreseeing the duplicate
dinner. That beats even the case where it
was insisted that the donkeyman should have
a fireman and a trimmer to assist him, though
he would have as much use for a geologist
and a curate.
Owen Smyth, lately of Adelaide, writes
from London that he has met Flinders Petrie,
authority on Egyptian antiquities, and grand-
son of Australia’s Flinders:— ,
He showed me his grandfather’s log and letter-
book, with the ink still black and the paper sound.
The logbook is going to the Mitchell Library in
Sydney. Lucky Mitchell Library! I wish it were
going to the home of S.A. archives. I have an
appointment with Mr. R. Colton, the sculptor who
executed the statue of Flinders for Sydney, to view
the model in his studio. I think a replica of the
Sydney statue can be purchased for £lOOO. Surely
this can be raised easily in Adelaide? I shall be
happy to collect at this end.... Until it shall be
erected in Victoria-square Light and Sturt will
feel lonely.
It was worth trying, perhaps, but it did
not come off. Mann, J., has, on appeal, up-
held the decision of the Vic. Licensing Court
(Licenses Reduction Board) that renewals
of license cannot be granted to pubs ordered
to be closed prior to the recent local option
poll. The point taken by the applicant in
the test case was that the electors in the
Emerald Hill licensing district had on Oct.
21 voted for no continuance of the then
existing number of licenses, and that con-
sequently it would be lawful to renew the
license for the Caledonian, in South Mel-
bourne, which was not (under the Licensing
Court’s order) to be delicensed till Dec. 31.
But Mann could not catch on to the casu-
istry.
Of the man a duke was sorry for: —
Sir John Ellerman, who got a paltry C.H. (Com-
panion of Honor) out of the New Year’s scramble,
spent more money on war work than many who
received peerages. He presented what had been a
royal duke’s mansion to the nation for use as a
soldiers’ hospital—in the closing stages of the war
it was reserved for “face” cases —and partially main-
tained it. This institution, which housed many
Diggers, was in Regent’s Park, within a five-minutes’
cab drive of Oxford Circus. It had only one defect:
it was almost next door to the Zoo and its nocturnal
howlings. Ellerman could afford to splash a little
money round. He is at the head of half a dozen
lines of ships. The Duke of Sutherland —one of
the greatest land-owners in Britain and Canada—
sat next to an Australian at a dinner in London
and gave the Overseas man points about various
guests. “Know the man three down from you?” he
said. “That’s Sir John Ellerman. He’s oppressively
rich —I’m glad I haven’t got his money.”
One streak of humor which the Upper
House threw out of the N. S. Wales Fair
Rents Bill dealt with goodwill. When leases
expired and were not renewed the owner was
to buy the goodwill from the tenant. If a
building was to be pulled down and there
were a herd of tenants the landlord might
have found himself possessed at great cost of
all right and interest in some house-agency
and general-finance businesses, a servants’
registry, a private ’tec agency (with the
right to shadow the man suspected of leading
the double wife), a photo studio, a cooked
foodery, and a picture-frame emporium. He
might even be entitled by compulsory pur-
chase to remove corns. Some big blocks in
Older Sydney that badly need pulling down
would yield quite a rabbit-warren of mixed
goodwill. What the new owner would have
done with it McTiernan only knows. Pro-
bably the deviser of the idea only meant it
for devilment, just as any other young blood
might paint a, cow green; but he might have
found better amusement.

The Lamp and the Fitting'.
COSMOS LAMPS.
British made; that means strength of material, soundness of
workmanship and real efficiency. All the world over, for
centuries, “British Made has stood for the best quality in
any article—that is why the COSMOS lamp is good—because
it is “British Made.” You don’t have to wonder how long
a COSMOS lamp will last, you know it will last the full time
of the material, will give the full rated candle-power at the
lowest possible current cost.
By the way, when handling Electric lamps—any of them—
remember they are fragile, even the strongest, and be gentle
with them. You would not be rough with a piece of delicate
eggshell china. There are more lamps broken through rough
handling than any other cause, so don t always blame the
lamp. However, use COSMOS LAMPS only; they are
strong, and you will have a much reduced Electric lamp
renewal bill, as well as a lower lighting bill.
PERFECLITE
-The ONLY LIGHT.
A 'new system of Electric lighting fixture, years in advance
of any known system —yet using a proven principle-^—of
reflecting mirrors, which increase the intensity of the light
and direct its diffusion in the proper manner. A motor-car
headlight is so brilliant because of its reflectors—so with
PERFECLITE.
Your Cosmos lamps will give 25 to 35 per cent, more light
if placed in a PERFECLITE fitting. Each fitting has a
battery of mirrors at different angles, the battery is so placed
(see figure 1 0 in the above illustration) as to force the light
down instead of allowing a lot of it to pass upward.
The PERFECLITE fittings are things of exquisite design,
the bowls are of eggshell translucent glass, that gives
all the brightness without any glare, thus PERFECLITE gives
the ideal of soft white light closely resembling daylight.
nm
For your Home, Office, Factory, Shop, COSMOS LAMPS and
PERFECTLITE Fittings will give you the most efficient service
and the greatest satisfaction.
If you have any Lighting problem—for your home or business
—we have a staff of lighting experts whose knowledge and advice
is entirely at your service.
Before settling any lighting problem call on us, or write us;
we will gladly help you to solve it.

If you can Manage a Horse
you can manage a simple farm engine. True, there are many things a good old
Dobbin can do which the Engine cannot, but for supplying power to belt-driven
machinery the farm engine is easily first for economy and effectiveness. Unlike
Dobbin, it eats nothing when not in use.
The WALLABY Petrol
FARM ENGINE
is a strongly-built engine, which, owing to its simplicity of construction, few
working parts liable to give trouble, and moderate use of Petrol, has given general
satisfaction to farmers all over Australia. It is made in either portable or
stationary type, in !£-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-horsepower size. Ten-horse mechanical
power is equal to one hundred man-power. A turn of the wheel and you have
instant, reliable power for driving pumps, corn-crushers, separators, winnowers,
shearing machinery, etc. Cheap power for high profits. - Prices are reasonable:
extended terms if you like.

We are proud to be able to advertise that
during the whole of the five years of war we
never raised the price of any of our diamond
stock, notwithstanding that diamonds rose 100
per cent, in those years. Our directors strongly
opposed profiteering. They thought it better to
increase customers rather than profits. Their
thought was right, too, as is shown by our
having sold last month DOUBLE what we sold
the same month last year.
We can safely advertise that we are selling
the best grade of diamonds at far less than
English prices.
Permit us to show this in comparison.

"The pirates of Penzance,” at Sydney
s » is Strella Wilson’s triumph as
Ibdxth. W onderfuily improved as an actress,
this robust young Australian singer deserved
tf> e enthusiastic noise she got for her “Poor
Wandering One”; and with James Hay
(PredencK) she scored heavily again in
Oh, Leave Me Not to Pine.” The light
tenor, though not in his best voice—he nad
a cold which drove him out of the cast this
week -did quite well in this number; and
he at least fitted the clothes of the part—
B rederick has often leaned too heavily
against his belt all round. Impressive Alice
Barnetts old part of liuth was taken by
Ethel Morrison, who made her a sprightly
domestic rouseabout; Charles Watenn was
the Majah-General, and none ever worked
harder and few ever got more laughs ; Albert
Kavanagh was a reposeful sergeant; and
Frederick Hobbs was a suitably lusty
Pirate King, whose best contribution was
m the “Paradox” trio with his pirate-appren-
tice and Miss Morrison. Of course, the
chorus work was excellent; and Minnie
Everitt, the producer, made one of her rare
appearances in front at the end of the even-
ing, and deserved the cheers that brought
her there.

In “The Lilac Domino” the small and
serious Jamieson Dodds pontinues to make
melodious love to Rene Maxwell, who is an
honest, sonsy lass, but has grown out of
the featherweight class. And the converg-
ing movement on the Tivoli box-office is still
brisk.

At Sydney Palace “Welcome,
continues to thaw the frosty atmosphere of
Little Valley, and put the Taits another yard
or two the other side of famine.
Applause, laughter, devotion (a general
thing as between the front of the house and
Dorothy Brunton ; a more individual affair as
between certain persons in the stalls and
on the stage) and a famine shortage of
“paper”—these are the chief characteristics
of “Baby Bunting,” now playing to full
houses at Sydney Criterion. To all queries
as to when the end is due the management
replies: “Dunno, except that there’d be a
riot if we closed up now.” ,
The fairies who live in Mosman Bay are
going to do something for Graythwaite, one
of the Red Cross (Sydney) homes for in-
capacitated soldiers, on the night of Anni-
versary Day (Jan. 26). They call it a
Venetian Carnival, though Venice never could
be what Mosman Bay is when the people who
occupy the foreshores and the heights turn
on their best illuminations. For the bedridden
Diggers donations are, of course, sought;
and local committees (W. J. Boylan, sec.)
are out seeking help in money or effort.

He’s a great novelist who goes summer-board-

At Gay field Shaw’s, in Sydney, there is
probably the most striking exhibition of sculp-
ture that Sydney has seen, and all the work of
a little scrap of an Australian woman. Eva
Benson has managed to get the plaster casts
ot her Itoyal Academy and Gallery successes
delivered; and although in transit some limbs
have suffered, the damage doesn’t detract
from the value of the exhibition. Strength
and grace characterise Miss Benson’s work ;
she is not afraid to attack big problems, as
witness her woman’s torso, which shows a
wonderful back melting into slim rounded
hips. Her Persephone bears the slender
limbs of young girlhood, and the startled
the hands opening in quick alarm from
the newly-gathered flowers, the half-turned
head on a throat where you can almost see
the pulse beat, make this statuette a thing of
genius. There’s a graceful if rather pensive
Bacchante. “Thoughts” is the head of a
patriarchal old man who might have been Job
atter hard luck had come upon him. The re-
lief in profile of a woman’s head brings out

At Melbourne Tivoli nothing has occurred
to disturb the harmony of glowing “Chu
Chin Chow” and its musical accompaniment,
except, perhaps, an increasing huskiness in
the well-worn warble of Workman. The
order of the procession of scenic events is as
before, and the moral of the story holds
good. It is the old Biblical moral about the
futility of laying up treasures on earth, for
as fast as the Robber Shaik lays up gold and
jewels in the cave, Ali Baba, with his son
and daughter-indaw-elect, breaks in and steals
the stolen goods. The rap'd change of
ownership is eminently satisfactory in its
sinful way. Ali, suddenly enriched, has a
real good kissing time with the Ravisher of
Hearts from sulky brother Kasim’s harem,
the young people express their sweet senti-
mentality in the loveliest of clothes, and
even the awful lawful Mrs. Ali, whose form
is like unto a scarecrow and whose voice is
sharper than a, pang of pain, partakes of
the family prosperity. Ali tries hard to
lose his leaner half, but she discovers him
at early dawn outside the leading drapery
emporium of Old Baghdad, and insists on
buying the whole of a wondrous dress-
parade at one fell swoop. Ali had intended
all the glad rags for his other girl, but being
caught in the act of going shopping he is too
much of a Persian gentleman to protest
against his deplorable old woman’s annexa-
tion of the goods. This miscarriage of injus-
tice is a feature of the last act, where Frank
Cochrane, the producer of the spectacle, used
to play the part of the cobbler in a quietly
natural way. The present cobbler is said
to be an imported successor to Cochrane,
but he amounts to much the same thing as
Cochrane in a milder degree. In fact, the
hardly distinguishable newcomer is about the
mildest cobbler going, and one suspects that
when he was fulfilling his contract with the
cold, quartered remains of lvasim Baba he
dropped a furtive tear among the stitches.

for versatility on the stage must be
awarded to the sex that gets no bouquets,
borne man or other can present a pretty good
picture, or a striking caricature, of nearly
any sort of woman, young or old ; but the
woman who pretends to resemble any sort
of man, under any circumstances, is either
an obviously charming fraud or a matter
for sincere regret. She can’t even resemble
one sort of woman. Once in a way a lady
low-comedian paints her nose red and tries
to pass herself off as a panto, dame. But
she never fills the bill.

“Sinbad the Sailor,” at Melbourne King’s,
continues to have eccentric conduct thrust
upon it by the American specialists Edgeley
and Dawe. One of the pair, who wears a
little flat hat and gargles his dialogue in a
manner that disturbs his countenance, is
afflicted with the habit of leaving his brolly
conspicuously in the O.P. wing and inquiring
tenderly about its welfare for the rest of the
performance. It is a queer form of humor,
and is not more remarkable than the panto-
mime of playing cards with his partner and
Jack Cannot on the deck of the Saucy Sher-
bet. The nature of their game isn’t specified,
but judging by the overgrown stiletto pro-
duced by Cannot at frequent intervals it is
cut-throat euchre.

He was a slim and gentle English tenor
who was tilling the Town Hall three nights
a week. He was at the piano, giving his
voice a little practice over the hurdles, when
a male hireling of the hotel appeared on the
window-sill and began cleaning a pane. After
live or _ six minutes the glass-polisher
pushed Ins head into the room. “I say
mister,” he said, “you are Iresdell, the pe'r-
fessional singer, ain’t you?” “I am some-
thing like that,” replied the tenor. “Then
look here,” declared the window-cleaner, “I’ll
tell you what I’ll do—l’ll sing you for half-a-

Will Lawson submits a theory about
tuning-forks and angels:—
Every maker of music has two legs. Poets, prima
donnas, troubadours, canaries, angels and tuning-
forks—all have two, no more and no less. Quadru-
peds and others, right up to centipedes, are out of
it. They can t sing a note. Their legs Won’t let
them.
the tuning-fork is at the bottom of the ladder,
the crude beginning of the theory. It stands on its
head and sends out music by the vibration of its
legs. Locusts do the same, but the noise they
make has no keynote, and therefore it is not music.
The musical vibration of the legs of tuning-forks
suggests that all makers of music do so simply
because their legs are in tune. We have heard of
an actor’s eloquent legs; why not a singer’s musical
legs—legs that vibrate at the same speed and pitch
as the cords of his throat? The difference between
such an artist and the tuning-fork is just one of ele-
vation or situation—one singer is standing on his
head and the other on his heels, but their legs
vibrate either way. If a quadruped makes noises
in its throat, the vibrations are lost in the horizontal,
thick body, with its four badly-tuned legs. The
trumpeting of an elephant, for instance, is not music.
Four legs and. more are tlje sign of the beast. Only
the two-legged may win to grace.
Yet many people and many birds cannot sing.
That is because they have discordant legs. Very
likely they were pulled in their youth. Those who
aspire to be singers should have their legs tested
as well as their vocal apparatus: it might be possible
to re-tune a faulty leg, to rebuild a flat arch of the
foot, or rebore a filled-up leg-bone, so that it will
give out a deep, true note.
One simple description of men was that they
were ‘trees walking.” A tuning-fork was obviously
shaped on the model of a tree, with superfluous
branches eliminated. So if we say men look like
tuning-forks walking, the affinity between us and
tuning-forks is established. Having grasped that
idea, it is easy to believe that, sooner or later, if
we evolve musically, on strictly two-legged lines,
we will become angels. Tb * immediate forward
stage for humanity is the bird; it is the link
between mankind and angels. On the bird plane
of development we will grow wings and learn to
fly, and our throats will become toughened for the
eternities of singing that lie before us. But even
in the highest development there will be a tendency
to stand on our heads and wave our musical legs,
as our tuning-fork ancestors did.

O.K. : The late Lewis John Lohr was
a blonde, debonair young fellow in the earlv
thirties when first I knew him as business
manager and treasurer to Rignold and Alli-
■son. That was in the autumn of 1885, when
was Paying a long season at the
old Melbourne Opera House, whereof he and
Jimmy Allison were lessees. A month pre-
viously Lohr had married Kate Bishop, the
leading lady of the co., whom the Firm had
MET THEM BEFORE.
“What are your terms?”
“Three guineas a week up.”
“But I am an actress!”
“Three guineas a week down!”
imported at the end of ’B4. Seeing that
Alarie Lohr s name is always printed in
English papers with the two German clots
ei the o, it. maj T be remarked here that
la.J. never claimed a German ancestry, nor
was aware of it. I remember how Frank
lancoin, the one-man entertainer, took it
tor granted that his business-manager Lohr
must be almost as German as his name and
appearance suggested, but L.J. remarked
that the family had always been English as
ur as he knew. Anyhow, wheu he married
the gifted actress who became Marie Lohr’s
mother, the announcement in Melbourne
Argus described the bridegroom as “youngest
son of the Rev. Charles Lohr, rector of
Alborg-Harleston, Norfolk, England,” whilst
the lady figured as youngest daughter of the
late Tom Bishop, Philadelphia, U.S.A. Only
two or three weeks before his death I wrote
to my old friend in M.L. asking him to tell
me, if he could, why his daughter’s name
i had been usually dotted over the o in the
English press, with the result that she was
i quite ordinarily supposed, even in the pro-
fession, to be of German parentage. This
by the way. “Daddy’s” connection with
Rignold and Allison lasted, I fancy, until
Allison and the firm died simultaneously,
and subsequently the genial showman be-
came a freelance and was particularly asso-
ciated with the late Charles Arnold and
Frank Thornton. He was business manager
of the original “Charley’s Aunt” tours
through Australasia, during which time he
established himself in the estimation of the
press as the most likeable man at the game.
\\ hatever show Lohr was running °ot a
kindly puff for the manager’s sake. One of
his happiest ventures was Dante, a hand-
some young conjurer, who boomed some 20
years ago, and got killed whilst out shoot-
ing near Sydney. Then came Charles
Arnold’s phenomenally lucky production of
“What Happened to Jones,” with Lohr as
managerial boomster, and when he was
through with Arnold’s final tour the popular
old pilot reckoned he was tired of the theat-
rical game and would be able to grow rich
by putting his capital into a pub at Ander-
son’s Inlet (Vic.). Lohr over-rated the pos->
sibilities of his new spec., and was a sick
man in all respects when he eventually
escaped from the pub. came to Melbourne
to be patched up. and presently got away to
Maoriland and fell among kind friends. A
while ago his wife and daughter in Eng-
land pressed him hard to return to his native
country to end his days, but old L.J. pre-
ferred to end them in the country he loved
much better. Some of the earlier portraits
of Marie Lohr are rather strikingly remind-
ful of her father, who always took all the
blame for the domestic estrangement which
had kent them apart so many years.
“Floater”: The traditional luck of the
Fullers stood by them in their efforts to
get a melodrama co. to Maoriland the other
day. While the Taits failed to get berths
for their “Irene” crowd, the Fullers packed
their people on to the Moeraki. The ship
suffered, of course, from a shortage of stew-
ards ; but just after leaving Sydney Heads
the skipper called the passengers together
and invited volunteers, and the full quota
was soon obtained. Ella Carrington. George
Cross and Walter Cornock served food and
did other duties in a manner that improved
with practice. For Ella Carrington it was
a wonderful performance. She is the elderly
widow of old Tom Taylor, and only a fine
spirit could overcome the disabilities of
being a stewardess at her time of life.
“T.D.M.”: The theatre may not know
Arthur Greenaway for some time to come.
He proposes to embark on a new scheme,
playing Shaksneare to the school children in
and around Melbourne. The consent of the
Minister has been obtained, and a company
of mummers with Greenaway in the lead is
being organised. The experiment will be
worth watching. Greenaway has the experi-
ence fit to lead such a combination. He has
plaved principal Shakspearean r6les in Eng-
land, America and Australia. He supported
Richard Mansfield in the States and the
great provinical star, Osmond Tearle, in the
Cold Country. He is. in addition, a pupil
of Billy Hoskins, and recalls the master’s
dictum that the most difficult and the most
complex of all the big parts is Macbeth, now
being played in London by James Iv. Haekett.
the beauty actor of some years ago. The
best Macbeth and Lady Mac. I have seen in
oO years were W. LI. Vernon and Genevieve
Ward, and that was at the Sydney Royal in
1884.
“Old Pot” : Grace Palotta, who is rusticat-
ing in Colombo, “where every prospect
pleases,” has made up her mind to take the
advice of friends and try her luck in the
movies. Grace knows how to wear clothes
has a winning smile, takes a beautiful photo-
graph, and is a finished actress—and what
else do they want? She intends to travel
in England and’the Continent before testing
her fate in the U.S.A.
“E.T.”: John Lawson, the clever little
character-actor who ivoukl have left a deeper
impression on local audiences had his
material been fresher, returned to London
from his Australian trip to die almost as
soon as he reached there. He passed out
at Charing Cross hospital in the last week
of November. Asthma trouble and a chill
proved too much for a constitution never very
robust. Lawson was one of the kindest-
hearted of men and capable of far better
mumming than those who saw his work in
Australia vmuld give him credit for.
. “Nero”: “M.R.’s” suggestion(B. 13/1/’2l)
is already a plank in the .platform of the
English Actors’ Union, which is far less
modest than its kindred body of Australia
in its demand for the betterment of condi-
tions in the profession. Its Utopian dream-
remedy for unemployment is “actor control”
ot all theatres. What exactly this means,
or how it is to be accomplished, is not clear
thing is clear—the chief difficulty would
be financial, as it always is in any scheme
IT J S'™ actors are concerned. Thus out
ot ,000 members enrolled in the English
Union over 2200 failed to pay their sub-
scriptions for 1920, and out of over £2OOO
due for death levies only about £l2OO

bers ot the Australian Actors’ Union hold

of their own business capabilities is evi-
denced by their electing an ex-member of
the stage staff as their general secretary.
Actor-control of the theatres in Australia
would not help the actor at all. The real
trouble is that in view of the small number
of theatres, the profession is woefully over-
stocked with capable f.a.q. actors, and the
only remedy appears to be more theatres and
more managements. Failing these, -what
about trying some other way of getting a
living? In this morning’s paper are over
60 advertisements for bricklayers.
“Herley”: In Blighty “Baby Bunting”
was a little musical farce with a continuity
“ ® s Pi witty dialogue which successfully
told the story, and a musical setting which
did not outrage the probabilities. Here at
Sydney Cri. we have the interpolation of
mannequin parades in weird and outrageous
costumes imitative of “Chu Chin Chow,” of
which freak dressing everyone is thoroughly
sick, and the addition of musical numbers,
such as the “Japanese Sandman” and “Cleo-
patra, ’ which are lugged in by the hair of
their heads and are utterly incongruous.
Besides, who ever saw a Japanese girl or a
Cleopatra with hair the color of Dot Brun-
ton’s? Poor Cecil Bradley’s part has been
cut to pieces, and she is entitled to a cer-
tain amount of sympathy on this account, as
well as because of her unbecoming frocks.
S.S. : Clyde Cook, the Australian
dancing gymnast and pantomime artist, has
realised his ambition to, lead an American
movie crew for the production of knock-
about film comedies. Clyde left Australia
with the idea in mind, and his performances
on the American speaking stage were shaped
to catch the film-producer’s eye. They caught
it, and Clyde Cook comedies are now on the
market. In answer to the playful derision
of an actor-friend Cook said before he left.
Oh, I have no very stupendous ideas —I am
just going to America to pick up Charlie
Chaplin’s leavings.”
“Norbell”: Though I don’t know where
that place about 80 miles from Melbourne”
is where John Hastings Batson nlayed in
Macbeth” on a billiard-table (B. 13/1/’2l)
I do know several curious old-time Vic!
theatres. I played once at Tarnagulla
with V ictor Prince and co. The theatre was
the pub billiard-room, and the “gallery” was
an ingeniously devised tier of seats built up
on the billiard-table. This theatre had tra-
ditions of G. V. Brooke, and the proprietor
showed me a hatch opening from the stage
to the pub kitchen, and declared that the
great tragedian had many beers handed
through the trap to sustain him during the
evening. But Tarnagulla is nearly twice
80 miles from Melbourne.
“T.P.”: Jim Crilly, who must be Austra-
lia s oldest showman, or pretty near it, still
coaxes music from kitchenware in Fifzroy
( Vic.). I can remember him in the ’seventies*
playing tunes on his teeth, on gridirons, fry-
ing-pans and other domestic utensils at the
old Paddy’s Market; but his star turn wa-
“Grand opera with the coffee-pot and bel-
lows.” With a banjoist from a lunatic
asylum, Jim tramped through Victoria from
the sea to the Murray, branching off at Tal-
langatta to do the Australian Alps. His
accompanist fulfilled the doctor’s prediction
that the simple life would cure him of his
aberration, but, according to Jim, he broke
out in 14 other places. The picture-shows
and increasing infirmities are bad for the
veteran’s line of business, but a small pen-
sion helps to keep the dingo from the door.
"C. Oc-kney” : Droll little AY. S. Percy is
making what is probably his first appearance
m pantomime in England. Released from
his work in “Irene” during the Christmas
season, “Billy” was able to accept an offer
to play the King in “Tom, Tom. the Piper’s
Son” at the Princes’, Bristol—a house
managed by one of the most respected
theatrical firms in Britain, the Chutes. The
Dame in the same production is Marriott E.
Edgar, seen here last -season in J.C.AA r ’s
“Sleeping Beauty.”
“Bob Ray”: Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Prin-
cess Ida” is due for revival. A new genera-
tion has arisen since it was last produced in
Sydney—at the Lyceum in 1893. Shall we
ever see such an array again in comic opera
—Nellie Stewart, Flo Young, May Pollard,
Elsie Cameron, Lauri, Ryley, Bracy. Howard
A ernon, Rosevear, Grundy and Lissant?
-the sole survivors of that cast are Nellie
Stewart, May Pollard and Howard Vernon ;
all the others have crossed the dark river.
“Fax”: Victoria Cross’s dream of repro-
ducing her 15 erotic novels in successful
drama form seems to have been blighted at
the outset of its realisation. She staged
The Greater Law,” and the audience
laughed even when it was expected to quiver
with passionate interest. The way banalities
are mixed with highfalutin sentiment was
too obviously absurd when her dialogue came
to be spoken. The .shrewd authoress has no
real sense of humor, I suspect; and that has
been so with better women-writers than
toria Cross from the earliest days. The
average woman of superior intellect is not
so keen as a man to distinguish between the
sublime and the ridiculous in dialogue. She
doesn’t hear a banality so quickly or dis-
tinctly.
“Billy T.”: Billy Hughes is the most
photographed Prime Minister we have ever
had ; not merely snap-shotten, a misfortune
that may happen to any man, and for which
he cannot be held responsible, but deliber-
ately photographed, and obviously prettied
up. If AVilliam did say he wanted mercy
from the camera, not justice, he certainly
gets all he asked for. My own conclusion is
that every time he gets a new suit he runs
off to be photographed in it, giving the trem-
bling operative the option of making him
look like first cousin to a beauty actor or
being shot with the next batch of profiteers.
The conscious efforts of the distressed trades-
man result in a picture of a lay figure with
an expression that suggests the effort of an
old-man alligator to look like an amiable
screen favorite. Billy is a great little pic-
ture-actor.
“WELCOME , STRANGER,” AT
SYDNEY PALACE.
Jules Jordan as Isadore Solomon.
Ancient I >roni Pter” : With the closing of
Melbourne Palace, where the Pullers' stock
company has been a fixture for years, drama
gives up the ghost as far as Australian capi-
tals is concerned. Strikers have a lot to
answer for. There is an army of actors
unemployed ; the majority are seeking other
ways of earning a crust.
BALLADE OF THE PANTOMIME DAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Four pantomimes are showing in Melbourne.”
She stumbles on, large are her feet,
Her red nose pugged so eerily ;
The crowd consider it a treat
When, falling on her bladebone, she
Displays her curious lingerie.
She clatters vainly all the time,
Her hair drops off, they yell with glee—
There’s but one dame in pantomime.
Her song is just a curious bleat,
The language is extremely free;
Her jokes on underclothes are neat;
■She talks of beer familiarly,
And of her various husbandry,
Experts in vice and comic crime.
Judicious patrons will agree
There’s but one dame in pantomime.
She runs an infant school, the seat
Of every child to baste with glee;
She works the jokes considered neat
When cavemen had their friends to tea,
And gnawed their bones so cheerilv.
Two meanings run in every rhyme.
If twenty pantomimes there be
There’s but one dame in pantomime.
Envoy.
I’ve watched for thirty years and three;
Rung in by saintly Christmas chime
They come in droves, yet you’ll agree
There’s but one dame in pantomime !

PROPERLY
Looking at Tilclen and Johnston in the ex-
hibition matches at Melbourne last week, one felt,
against all the evidence of figures, that Johnston is
the more formidable of the two. A small, hatchet-
faced man, who looks as if tennis is his only vice,
he can deliver heavy punishment from forehand or
backhand and serve and volley with equal severity.
His greatest weapon is a violent cross-court drive
off the forehand, which only good volleyers like
Brookes and O’Hara Wood can return with any suc-
cess. Tilden is in another category altogether.
Lacking the nonchalance of his midget companion,
whose fighting power is concentrated in a 9-stone
body, Tilden is in temperament and appearance a
volatile and overgrown schoolboy. It is impossible
to dislike his frank expressions of pain and pleasure
when his play varies from genius to woodenheaded-
ness, but a man who hits the court with his racket
in the annoyance of netting a simple return seems to
have been intended by Nature for the other sex and
the operatic profession. All the same, he is master
of many strokes, many of which are decoratively
sliced. Also he is clever in hiding the intended
direction of the ball from the most watchful oppo-
nent, and capable, like Johnston, of hitting very
hard. But he can' make some awful bloomers,
especially in doubles. His first ball is no more
certain than Patterson's, but when it gets over it
is the twin brother of a bullet. All the same, it is
not so rich in moral effect as it is expected to
appear, and when the consciousness of its terror is
lightened by familiarity it will get frequently ham-
mered, as Patterson’s is, and a good third of Tilden’s
game will be gone. Another thing—and the most
vital in an international—is his lowered will-to-win
when faced with dogged opposition. He was rattled
in the Doubles against Brookes and O’Hara Wood
last Thursday, and the growing tension took some of
the sting out of his play. There is no man here
capable of troubling him, however. His record of
wins is such a powerful psychological factor that
none of our men, bar Brookes, can nlay him with
any confidence. But if the Englishman, Ivingscote,
ever has another hand with the Yank and gets a
decent lead in the opening games, Tilden’s nerves
will give him the time of his life.
The matches didn’t provide a wholesale triumph
for the Yankee team. True, Tilden won all his
matches, beating Brookes (6 —i, 6—4), Hawkes
( 6 —3, 6—3) and O’Hara Wood (8 — 6, 6 —2), but
Johnston had to go three full sets to wallop Brookes
(3 — 6, 6 — l, 6 —4), and lost afterwards to Patterson
(6—2, 4 —-6, 6 —4), the Victorian restoring by a
sudden revival of an irresistible service some of his
sadly damaged prestige. In the Doubles the Vic-
torian superiority was clearly established. Brookes
and O’Hara Wood, playing the best of five sets —
practically a Davis Cup match —against the two
champions, Johnston and Tilden, went out in three
sets (6 —4, 7■ —s, 6 —3). The perfect team-work of
the Victorians, combined with their ability to volley
back the hardest swipes, robbed Johnston and Tilden
of their plan of campaign, and brought the inevitable
defeat in the third chapter to the verge of a rout.
Tilden, playing the worst of the four, got a lot
more than his due from the Victorian offensive and
often found the net in the way. Patterson and
Hawkes were also too good for Tilden and Washburn
in the best two out of three, the locals romping
home 6 —3, 7—5. In the final Doubles of the
tournament, O’Hara Wood and Hawkes v. Johnston
and Washburn, a narrow victory went to Uncle Sam,
chiefly through the errors of Hawkes and the solid
assistance given to Johnston by the imperturbable
Washburn. Washburn’s unostentatious service often
worried Hawkes, and the Yank’s cool work in the
rallies got his side out of many a tight place. The
final scores were 5—7, 6 —3, 4—6, 6—2, 6 —3.
*** ’ »
J. Olenwnger, who defeated S. Spratt
(6 —1, 6—4) for the County of Cumberland singles
tennis championship at Ashfield (Sydney) last week,
showed fine bvrm. His driving and placing were
excellent. In the doubles the brothers Jim (N.S.W.
champion) and Clarence Anderson defeated G. Reid
and H. Kirkpatrick. In a. vigorous bout of 52
games the Andersons won by 27 to 25. The family
has a thirst for small tennis championships, and
last year won the Western Suburbs and Northern
Suburbs titles. Jim Anderson has almost recovered
from the illness which kept him out of the M.L.
tour with the N.S.W. team. There was a refreshing
show of promising players at the tournament.
The first stage of N.S.YV. swimming cham-
pionsnaps at cue Domain iiacns on taanaay arew
the biggest crowd of its kind seen in Sydney. Six
thousand enthusiasts put up with all sorts of incon-
venience to get just a casual glimpse of the pro-
ceedings, and many didn’t even get that. An hour
before the start the placard notified “standing room
only”; and still they squeezed in, many carrying
unfinished lunch. it is a municipauy-governed
enclosure and overcrowding was winked at. The
100yds. championship was the tit-bit, and with 17
entrants three heats were drawn. In the first Billy
Herald beat Les Boardman by a touch in 57sec.;
Pau Kealoha (Hawaii) took the second easily from
H. Degotardi in 62 l-osec. ; and in the third H. M.
Hay finished ahead of Sid Beck in 58 2-ssee. The
start in the final was very ragged, and all except
Kealoha hung at the “go.” Rising quickly to the
surface the Hawaiian streaked away as though pur-
sued by devils and splashing heavily won comfort-
ably by four yards in 56sec. In fact, he was waiting
for the others to finish and give them a hand to the
pontoon. It was a very hollow win. The time was
2sec. faster than Norman Ross (America) won in
last year, and 3sec. slower than Duke Kahanamoku’s
world’s record. The main interest after 50yds. was
in the minor positions; in a stirring finish Herald
was second, Beck third, and two of the others were
less than a yard away.
Seven stripped for the half-mile —-the best Australia
had to offer and Ludy Langer (Hawaii) ; but the
tourist made a procession of it. At 110yds. he
turned a yard ahead of Prank Beaurepaire (Vic.),
and widening the gap at every length won easily by
30yds. in llmin. 16 4-ssec. from Prank Beaurepaire
(who was “digging” deeply), F. S. Cotton and Billy
Longworth. 'Langer finished comparatively fresh;
the others had bellows to mend. By the watch the
race was 7 2-ssec. faster than Ross’s last year, but
still slower than Barney Kieran’s llmin. 11 3-ssec.,
which has stood for nearly 16 years.
The two championship gatherers are as unlike as
it is possible to be. Pau Kealoha, who sported a
grey, well-worn robe, is thick-built and bronze, and
a bundle of smiles. He is modelled for a swimmer,
with shoulders and chest that give him the appear-
ance of a huge snapper; and as he cleaved the water
in thunderous fashion, his legs scissored with the
rapidity of a propeller. There is nothing clean in
his style, and all of the other starters were artists
by comparison ; but he got there. Ludy Langer is slim-
built, just showing tinge of baldness. He has
beautiful style, and skimmed the water so evenly
and methodically that scarcely a ripple was left on
the surface. The pity was that nobody was near
'enough to make him sprint over the last lap, or
world’s figures might have been damaged. LangeNs
excellent “turning”, was a feature, and as he
touched with the hand turned sharply and pushed
off smartly with the left foot. It was very neat.
The 100yds. country championship was an easy
win for W. H. McDonald (Newcastle) in 61 3-ssec.
from town-mates W. Redwin and Harold Field ; and
Ow'en Griffiths (who was much the bigger youngster)
badly beat A. Charlton and L. Leadbeater in the
440yds. Keiran Memorial scratch for Public School-
boys in 6min. 15 2-ssec. Dick Eve (Manly) and
R. Provan (Sydney) were the only high-divers, and
after a fine exhibition Eve won with 190 points
against I§SJ. In the N.S.W. 500yds. teams’
breast-stroke championship University surprised Syd-
ney (holders) by defeating them by 25yds. in 7min.

Ethelda Bleibtrey, the lady section of the
invading Yankee swimming contingent, had a dip
at Auckland last week, and repaid. hospitality by
winning “invitation” races over 50vds. (29 2-ssec.),
100yds. (68see.—3 2-ssec. better than the Dominion
record) and 300 metres (4min. 41 3-ssee.). Violet
Walrond, just back from the Olympic Carnes, was
second in both the long events. Miss Bleibtrey
is holder of the world’s records for 100yds. (65
3-ssec.) and 300 metres (4min. 34sec.). The retire-
ment of Fanny Durack looks like giving the Yankee
miss easy wins in the big. events in the Common-
wealth.

The nuggety Solomon Islander Alec Wick-
ham showed a turn of speed in the Sydney League
66yds. handicap, the other day, finishing second (off

At Albion Park (Q.) Mrs. Whitehouse’s
Sydney suburban casc-otf, Faithful Laddie, was tmrd
fancy in a field of three for the First Division
Handicap and- ran as expected. Like a lot of im-
ported horses Onward Way, having once started
winning after impoverishing his connections, may
keep on for several weeks and then show a remarkable
reverse of form. Having won the Fourth Division
Handicap and failed in the Purse the previous
Saturday the Willonyx gelding was asked only to
battle for the Purse last Saturday. He was just
chucking it as he and Princess Alma reached the
post together. He got the verdict from the outsider.
Caulfield Cup winner King Off a (imp.) is
to be given another chance to stand a preparation.
He is among the entries for the Sydney Cup.

“Floater”: Australia dropped eight catches
in the First Test and the uneven fielding of Vic-
toria against N. S. Wales last week suggests that
fielding practice is not popular with our elevens.
Victoria has undoubtedly the most backward team in
this respect. McDonald’s dropping of an easy one
from Taylor at a vital stage of Ma’s second hits
last week was not more humiliating to watch than the
fumbled ground
fielding by other
men. One of the
reasons why N.S.W.
is so strongly re-
presented in the
Test team is the
Ma Staters’ alert-
ness in the field.
The work of Col-
lins and Taylor has
a certainty that
makes one yearn
for equal perfec-
tion else where.
Moreover, it is
almost true
that only
N.S.W. men at-
tempt “throw-
ing out.”
A. C.
RUSSELL,
whose score-
card for the first
two Tests read
0,5, 0,5, carries
his hat for
135 in the first
innings of the
third Test.
M arren Bardsley’s 235 v. South Aus. last
week lifted his aggregate to 787 (averaging 87.44)
in first-class matches this season. Armstrong’s 789
(averaging 98.6) are the only higher figures. Bards-
ley made an earlier double-century in first-class
cricket in Australia-—264 for the Australian XI v.
The Rest in 1909. In Sydney premiership cricket
his 1145 in 1918-19 is the top-notch season's aggre-
gate; also his “double” of 136 and 130 is the
only record of its kind in Test cricket. When he
began this season with 6 and 3 not out v. England
there was a rumble that he might be stood down;
but the left-hander has developed rare form, and
at 36 gets a third trip to England with an Aus-
tralian XI. In the previous visits he topped the
run-getters with 2180 (av., 46.39) in 1909 and
2441 (av., 51.93) in 1912. Victor Trumper’s 2570
in 1902 is the only higher aggregate on an English
jaunt.
* * * *
Auckland’s grip on the Plunkett (M.L.)
Shield soon relaxed, and last week Wellington de-
feated them by 105 runs. The holders put up a
big fight, and facing 442 in the last innings scored
336. Brice’s eight wickets for 112 carried the glory
to the Windy City.
* * * *
There is some doubt as to whether Ivelle-
way will be able to join the Australian XV for
England. Though he was greatly huffed when he
wasn’t picked along with the first eight chosen, he is
by no means certain that he can leave Australia for
so long a period. Macartney’s position is also un-
certain. His recent illness in Melbourne has worried
the selectors, and they may even ask him to produce
a couple of doctors’ certificates before they take his
ticket.
* * * *
In Sydney grade cricket on Saturday
’Varsity, being sports, declared, but just failed to
get a four-point win against Petersham. In Pete’s
second knock A. Thatcher was the only batsman to
jump out at Sturt’s teasers. Gostelow shone behind
the sticks. Gordon felt Macartney’s absence when
they tried to bowd Sydney out. Smith and Jenkins
did most to extract whatever sting the bowling had.
Flynn (5 for 77) was erratic at times, but the
occasional extra fast one was deadly. At Gordon’s
second effort Asher bowled below and O’Connor
above his form. Hoskins '(4B n. 0.), reliable if slow,
saved his side from disaster. C. Cumberland against
Paddington, after having the game in hand, lost it
by two runs. Only three men got double figures. Dr.
E. Trenerry, who is at his best in club cricket,
bagged seven orchardists at a very low cost. Norths,
in their second attempt against Wests, showed what
a one-man team it is. Austin Punch contributed 63
out of the 138 runs scored. Wall again was to the
fore with the ball for Wests, and his 10 wickets, for
the match, cost a shade over nine runs apiece. Glebe,
but for Morgan’s second-innings score of 78, would
have gone dowm to Waverley by an innings. Ives
(4 for 45) and Forssberg (5 for 41) were respon-
sible for-their follow-on. Folkard’s 11 wickets for
72 showed what Middle Harbor were up against
when they tackled Balmain. The river subu-b won
by an innings. All the Village bats failed miserably.
» * * *
The only purple patch in Melbourne Dis-
trict cricket on Saturday was Moyes’s 208 for
Richmond against Essendon. Richmond, totalling
223, thought the3 r had a fair chance of a win;
but Moyes got busy and had his side home by 5
wickets and 101 runs at the finish. Melbourne with
a lead of 93 oyer North in the first hits, tried’for a
straignt-out win by closing with 5 for 103 but
North smacked up 119 for 4, so Melbourne had to
be content with their first-innings’ majority. P’ran
closing with 9 for 222, were very nearly waiioped bv
Mood, who had amassed 213 for 7 at the call of
time (Keating 108). The match was a draw Uni-
versity were 57 short of ’Roy’s 292, the ausence of
Park in Adelaide affecting the students’ score. St
Hilda beat Northcote on the first innings by 66!
’Cote made only 156, but when Saints had another
turn they fell rapidly for 119 (Hartkopf 4 for 44).
Carlton, with 307 in hand, were confident of captur-
ing South s scalp, but South produced a defence and
managed a draw with 7 for 248.
Francis Charles, the French welter, gave
Tommy Uren, formerly Australia s undisputed Dest
middleweight, a proper hiding at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night. Uren was said to have a bruised
wrist or injured finger or what not. On form he
might be suffering from the complaint which has
attacked Lenin as the outcome of the latent attempt
on his life. Charles missed about three times out of
five, though it was not Uren’s fault in most cases—
he was so slow sometimes that a blind man could
have hit him. Towards the end of the scuffle the
Frenchman was dosed with champagne, the effect
of which was to make his smiting wilder than ever.
A somewhat peevish crowd included several ladies
and a large and bloodthirsty party of French sailors
who displayed an intimate knowledge of this once
exclusively-British sport.

Jimmy Wilde, the wonderful Welsh fly-
weight, who lias to give away many pounds in all
his fights, met Pete Hermann on Thursday night at
the Albert Hall (London) for what 'was billed as
“the bantam championship of the world.” it can
only be concluded that this match was made and
advertised, and the presence of the Prince of Wales
and other royalties assured, before Pete lost his title
to Joe Lynch at Madison Square Garden (N.Y.) last
December. Hermann won the world’s bantamweight
championship from Kid Williams, on points, at
New Orleans in 1917, and successfully defended the
title till the Irish-American cyclone struck him a
month ago. As showing the glorious uncertainty of
stoush, Jimmy Wilde, who was outed in the 17th by
Hermann last week, beat Joe Lynch at the big Inter-
Allied Tournament in London in 1918. On Hie other
hand, Hermann, the victim of Lynch and the sub-
duer of Wilde, -has four times defeated Jack
Starkey, who got a newspaper decision over Wilde
in the latter's first American contest in 1919.
Benny Leonard, lightweight champion of
the wond, who knocked out Kitchie Mitchell at
New York on Friday in six rounds, did the same
thing to the same man in the same number of founds
at Milwaukee in April, 1919. Mitchell is the only
man who has beaten Leonard; and he not only
knocked out Llew Edwards in his first bout in
America, but followed it up by exterminating Clonie
Tait, who had stopped the great Welshman in two
rounds.

The Sydney Flying Squadron decided a
general handicap last Saturday, which also served as a
trial gallop for next Saturday’s big event. Twelve
elected to start from scratch: the remaining 10 took
their handicaps and let the chance of inter-State
glory slide. A sick easterly enabled most of the fleet to
lay the marks. George Drysdale sailed Pastime superbly
over the second portion of the course, and being
fortunate enough to lay the marks at Taylor Bay
and Shark Island, romped home an easy winner by
lfmin. from W. J. Duncan’s Kismet (the only scratch
entrant to get a place), which anticipated the ama-
teur-built Sydney (Norman Blackman) by a. quarter
of a minute. The result decided that Mascotte, Kis-
met, H. C. Press and Britannia shall represent
N. S. Wales against the Westralian and Bananaland
top-notchers.

Royal, which annexed Drummoyne (Syd-
ney) Parle Skiff Club’s Second Championship on Satur-
day was launched for the first time the previous Thurs-
day and had not even had a trial spin. A. Roderick, who
sailed her, performed a similar feat in the 14-footer
Roderick three years ago. She w r as launched on the
morning of a scratch race, won, and was sold the
same day.

Stan Spain’s Mischief lifted the Kelly
Cup from a field of seven deep-keelers on Saturday and,
incidentally, won the Sydney Amateur Sailing Club’s
Championship. Mischief also took this honor last
season. The fleet got away to a flj'ing start in a
light easterly, and Don Taylor’s Triton was first to
ease sheets and elevate her ballooner at the Village
mark. She rounded with a whisker to Spare from
Waitangi (H. L. Carter —3min. 12sec.), which pre-
ceded Seabird (scratch) by a similar margin. They
finished in that order, but when handicaps had been
adjusted it was found that the placings were: Mis-
chief 1, Waitangi 2, Triton 3. Spain’s charge, which
started from the Bmin. 31see. mark, won bv 30sec.

Melbourne Inman, who held the billiards
championship for years and surrendered it in a
petulant moment to the youthful Smith, has been
handsomely beaten, in a match for the title and
£250 aside, by the same Smith. In the early part
of the game Inman went away with a good lead, and
evidently his systematic potting and pitying con-
tempt for his opponent’s play had the youngster
worried, as they used to worry Reece. But Smith
came to light with a break of 802 —58 better than
Inman’s own record for a championship match —and
thenceforward he had things all his own way, run-
ning out a winner by 1861 points. It was the worst
defeat the cynical ex-champion has ever suffered.
But he has been a long time at the game, and they
can’t last for ever.

The consistent Alf Grenda with Bill
Erskine as partner, had a comfortable win in the 24-
hours’ bike-grind at Sydney last week-end. The
event was decided on points, and the winners scored
33, Jackie Clark and E. Priestley 29, Hans Ohrt and
P. Henry 22, and F. Wells and Atkins 20. In twiee-
round-the-elock 493 J miles were left behind, which
beat the previous record of the track by 181 miles.
The race had unfortunately many bad spills. Over
some of these there were allegations of “rough”
riding which the League should inquire into. In
one of the dashes, Erskine broke a collarbone. The
bright spots were the picking up of a lap by G.
Staples and W. Lee (who had re-teamed after losing
partners), and the final sprint, won by Hans Ohrt,
though he was covered in bandages—certainly a
triumph for the ambulance men.
THE BOOM IN DEPORTMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Murder Most Foul!” The heading strikes the
startled eye,
And we produce the needful on the spot,
\et promptly pass the luscious feast of bloodshed by
And search the sporting page with interest hot
To find what Wilson’s latest views on umpires are—
Heedless of him whose brains lie littered near and
far.
“Young Girl Attacked: Says that Her Very Blood
Congealed 1”
That is a certain winner, you might say;
But Wilson on “Conventions of the Cricket Field”
Beats it for sheer allurement any dayt
His “Win or Wrangle” and his “Manners Makyth
Man”
Are rushed alike by peer and proletarian.
Earnest, though h-less, Henley damns each Romish
plot ;
Hughes fights for freedom on lines all his own;
Ryan, the Anglo-Austral-Irish patriot,
Also absorbs the limelight. But alone,
And over ail sits Wilson, and, in language terse,
Expounds correct behavior to the universe.'

I rof. Baldwin Spencer and his lady gave
a reception for members of the Science Con-
gress at the Botanical Gardens. They
planted a marquee alongside the tea kiosk
near the lake and spread food for hundreds
oi highbrows. Lieut.-Governor Murray, of
Papua, was there ; Professor David and Pro-
fessor Mawson; Dr. Gilruth; Prof. Wills-
more, of Perth; Brunnich, of Bananaland;
David Garment, the veteran actuary from
Sydney; Roy Burdon. of the Speck, where
the junketings should have been; Profs.
Stewart, Watt and Taylor, from Sydney;
i r< A and Dr. Gertrude Halley, of
S. Aus.; the Maidens, from Sydney, and heaps
ol other intellectuals. Wives and sisters and
cousins and aunts were there also—either
highbrows themselves or wearing the re-
flected glory of related highbrows. The
hostess spread a gorgeous gown of flimsy
black with colored embroideries woven over
it. _ Mrs. Murray wore all green. Mrs.
I riestley’s dress was ivory lace over
corn-tassel silk. Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson
got_ into smoke-grey, with cherry-colored em-
broideries, and her large, fair husband repre-
sented some of the weight of the Biology
division. The Congress’s Victorian secretary
(Dr. Georgina Sweet) had a frivolous hat of
tulle over her clever brain and wore white
cloth tailorings. A rain-storm scudded off
during the afternoon and gave the party fair
weather; but the guests kept to the‘foot-
paths- the thick grass was still wet and
squashy. The gardens looked their loveliest,
and baby ducks bobbed by the dozen on the
pond. It was a master-stroke of the Presi-
dent to bring Harbor-side visitors and Der-
went-side dwellers to one of the real beauty
spots of Melbourne.
The appearance of the American cham-
pions at the Albert Ground last week brought
a multitude that crammed the new stands
built over the north and west fences. On
Thursday the weather was cool and threaten-
ing and produced fashion’s last sob in furs
and coats, but Friday and Saturday were
dreams of sunshine, whereat all Sassiety and
its motah came along in the brightest rags
to give the color scheme of an infant’s pic-
ture-book to the dearest seats. The over-'
charges of 155., 10s. and ss. were exacted for a
sight of the Americans, and every flapper’s eye
followed the graceful Tilden, who is six feet
of elastic energy and has an arresting taste
in clothes. On the first day his shaggy
sweater, looking like a loose goatskin gar-
ment that had forgotten to finish at the
proper place, was voted “feahfully smart.”
After that he caught the eye with a beauteous
long coat the color of a coffee biscuit. Then
he broke out in a yed-white-and-blue belt,
which was remarkable to the Victorian
players, who never wear any. Johnston, with
his curly brown hair and nothing about him
but his game to cause a demand for his auto-
graph, is an unassuming midget beside his
large and smiling colleague, Washburn,
whose main points are a want of hair-
restorer, a large pair of horn goggles, and an
air of having just left a volume on Pragma-
tism to take part in a frivolous pastime.
Violet Lorraine, who has just become en-
gaged to Hugh Edward, second son of Lord
Joicey, made no great stir when she was in
Australia as a pantomime boy a dozen years
ago. But that wasn’t her fault: a panto,
hero’s r6le gave little scope for her leading
qualities of humor and the capacity to ex-
press the West End of London spirit on the
stage. In “The Bing Boys” she rivalled
George Robey himself for popularity during
most of the war. Pier prospective husband
is no chicken, any more than she, being 40
years of age and a colonel. He was a captain
in the 14th Hussars when the war began and
went to France with the Contemptibles. The
family is one of the richest in England, the
money coming partly from Durham collieries
and partly from the at-one-time Radical
Daily Leader of Newcastle, and it only
numbers four, including the father.
The Commonwealth Government may have
done some Australian girl a very bad turn
when it shut out young Mr. Esmonde. He is
a matrimonial catch, being heir to about
10,000 acres in Wexford. The ruthless
Sassenach greatly added to the value of the
Esmonde estates in recent years by ad-
vancing money for local expenditure, and
those tenants who bought gladly paid a high
figure. Our anti-English visitor, like his
father, was educated at an English school,
and is not to be distinguished by his speech
or appearance from the typical Eton and Ox-
ford product who arrives on a Governor’s
staff.
The G.-G. has gone to Adelaide in the
wake of big cricket. He and Lady Forster
will be in the Speck in a few weeks time,
D.V. and the ship-stewards permitting.
General and Mrs. Wheatley have vacated
the vice-regal bungalow in favor of Lord and
Lady Digby and their son and heir. The
Digby infant, by the way, appears to have
a trio of nurses all to his little self.
Engineer-Commander Mackenzie, now of
the Royal Navy retired list, and his wife,
who is the William Weatherleys’ younger
daughter, have just acquired what is left of
the late Admiral Bridges’s Western District
place Trawalla. The price was £72,000, it
is said. The Closer Settlement Board re-
cently acquired portion of the property and
cut it up for soldiers’ farms.
Georgina Sweet —there is honey in the
sound of it. If you reverse the order of
their going the words sound almost as tooth-
some. The learned lady, who, among many
other things, is president of the provisional
committee of the Women’s College that is
to be built on the “cattle-market site” facing
the Uni., was specially thanked by the
Science Congress for having organised things
in Melbourne when arrangements for holding
it in Hobart had been blighted by the
stewards.
The Fred Fairbairn pair don’t attempt to
hide their joy in the arrival of the male
grandchild whom the Stork deposited at the
Toorak house lately hired by the F.F. son and
heir and his Titian wife, who was an English
girl and a Hastings. The head of the house of
Hastings, the Earl of Huntingdon, married
a daughter of the late Victorian squatter-
knight Salmon Wilson.
The eldest Herbert Syme girl, Anabel
Frances, has just said Yes to Dr. W. M.
Gutteridge’s thii-d ex-khakied son, Alan Gor-
don, who ended up his battlefield experiences
with a couple of years in a Hun prisonei’-of-
war camp.
Dr. Reggie Weigall’s youngest chick Helen,
who was spending the holidays at Portsea,
welcomed the New Year by becoming en-
gaged to Edgar Longshaw Walton, a young
English engineer who has been helping to
electrify the Melbourne railways. The
doctor and his wife don’t feel so sure of
their prospects of a happy New Year, since
they see it holds a parting with 20-year-old
Helen, who is a tall, golden-haired, endear-
ing young person. The two elder girls pro-
vided them with sons-in-law some time back.
Merle Mayne, daughter of the J. P.
Maynes, of Princes Hill, has said the im-
portant word to William Darton, of Ber-
ringa Park.
Huiuphrey and Co. give you the latest
picture of Norman Brookes, acknowledged
on all sides the greatest tennis player the
world has ever pro-
duced. Norman is
now in the forties,
and though he hasn’t
all his old activity,
he still gives spark-
ling displays of that
delicacy and preci-
sion which make the
worl d’s next-best
marvel. Last week
in Melbourne the old
champion, assisted by
the brilliant O’Hara
Wood, again proved
his greatness by over-
whelming the Ameri-
can pair, Tilden and
Johnson, in a doubles
encounter. His work
showed that Brookes
retains much of his old quality, and suggests
that he may head Australia on another Davis
Cup hunt during the next few months.
Architect Kilpatrick is at Menzies’ with
his bride—a milk-and-roses girl, with lovely
ginger hair. The honeymooners motored
nearly a thousand miles, mostly along the
coast, before they reached Melbourne from
Sydney. Tasmania was to have had a vision
of the little bride, but the uncertainty of
boats blocked that trip. Mrs. Barry Thomp-
son gave a party at the Oriental on Friday
to meet Mrs. Kilpatrick. Mrs. Scot, aii
American who has just stepped off here
after a long journey from Japan through
the Islands, was also at the party. She was
a symphony in blue. The young bride chose
copper-color from hat to satin shoe-tips. Mrs.
Barry hostessed in a Futuristic gown of
blue splashed with yellow and terra-cotta.
The color-noise could not drown her smiles.
The Norton Grimwades are causing an
upheaval at Cliveden. They have bagged
the biggest flat, which includes the drawing-
room where once Janet Lady reigned: and
it has its own rose-garden and parterres,
with windows that look across into the Fitz-
roy Gardens. The ill-fated Hun rubber-tyre
and motor magnate who was camouflaged as
Edwards had the flat when Cliveden was
first “converted.”
Mrs. Hodges has got peacefully back to
Dreamthorpe, her summer home at Macedon.
The honeymooning Roma
pair, who borrowed it, are sorting the

. Squatter Charles Hidgeock’s widow is
giving thanks for seeing the New Year: she
only just pulled through after a serious
operation. She goes to the Oriental as a
stepping-stone to Mornington and sea
breezes; then streaks for the Murrumbidgee
home-station to get things ready for son
Charlie’s bride.
“Daddy” (L. J.) Lohr was the last of
an old generation of theatrical managers,
and a universal
favorite. Hi s wife
was Kate Bishop, a
star of other days,
and their one child
was Marie Lohr,
than whom no Aus-
tralian woman—sav-
ing the singers—has
had greater success
on the English
stage. “Daddy,” in
his last ventures—
he retired from the
business 25 years
a g o—h a d Edwin
Geach to help him;
and the accompany-

that came lately to
this old associate
with a characteristic message from the lov-
able old man, then at Rotorua, where the
curtain fell.
Molly Griffiths, the Australian girl who
scored a whole bagful of British golf cham-
laurels, is back in her native Aussie
with her clerical dad on a few months’ visit,
lier mother, who is a sister of Mrs. Ernie
Austm, was a Western District heiress, a
Miss Macpherson.
Geitrude Johnson intends taking away
one ot the best voices in Melbourne a month
earlier than she at first intended to. She
sails on h eb. 5, the haste being due to a
desire to land in England good and early for
the concert season, which begins late in
April. Friends and admirers give her a
farewell entertainment at the Lyceum Club
on Jb eb. 1.
George Wise, the P.M.G., got his earlv
training as a public man in the Sale Borough■
Council. From 1880 till 1905 he was the
heavyweight of the corporation of the Gipps-
land capital, and mayor several times.
Mr. 1. Cullman, the present mayor, rounded
up past and present councillors the other
day, making the New Year the excuse, and
Wise reminisced interestingly. It was a
great night, and all agreed that Tommy
Cullman had done things properly.
An important old schoolmarm died last
week—-x Mrs. Pfund, who was head of Ober-
wyl Tor long, long years. At Oberwyl, in
ot. iviida, Lady Clarke-Grey-Egerton was a
pupil; so were Mrs. Pursey Chirnside, Mrs.
Bverard Browne and many other squatto-
crats m their pigtail days. Mrs. Philip
Russell, the Edward Bage and the Charles
Bage dames, Mrs. Robert Simson and the
tribe of Robertson squatteresses—all were
put through deportment drill by the deplored
departed.
The Victorian Medical Women’s Associa-
tion is 25 this week. The president, Dr.
Lilian Alexander, was one of the original
members. Dr. Lucy Gullett, Dr. Emma
Buckley and Dr. Mary Booth are over from
oydney for the celebration.
Senator Keating and his family are wal-
lowing joyously in the blue wavelets of their
native island, at Kingston Beach. Shipping
troubles not interfering, they are soon to be
joined in their roomy cliffside camp by one
or two Sydney friends.
The late Lady Roberts once had three
sisters living at seaside Warrnambool—
Mrs. Beamish (wife of Archdeacon Beam-
ish), who died many years ago; Mrs.
Stevens, who passed out not long since; and
Mrs, Miller, who was accidentally killed bv a
fall over a cliff at Honolulu when returning
from a trip to America. The sisters were
very charming women and greatly liked in
the district.
Ex-Chief Justice Henry Parker, of West-
ralia, with a couple of his daughters, is
summering in a Melbourne flat until May.
The elder of the two girls has practically
lived in the State for some years. She is
a cheery little brunette and sings very
sweetly. Sister Mildred, who is fair and
rather statuesque, is a musician in a more
ambitious way.
George Highland, who is producing “Maid
of the Mountains” for the Firm, is a very
sick man, thanks to overwork and nervous
strain. Despite his having fainted on the
threshold of his hotel and being interned in
his bedroom by medical orders for five days
he insists on carrying on until the thing' is
launched. Highland declares that the Cole-
mans have the London scenery badly beaten,
and that Gladys Moncrieff can hold her own
with Daly’s Josie Collins.
Agar Wynne’s only chick Mary, who mar-
ried the son of Richardson, a Belfast linen
manufacturer; is returning to her native
wattle with her baby and husband. The
latter will turn his interest from linen to
wool and manage his father-in-law’s Western
District sheep-run.

holders are implored to run along and do a
bit of shopping there.
t JF iapel ; Street district looked like
the end of a perfect picnic last Friday night,
n order to fill some of the vacuum created
i early closing of the tram service, the
t rahran Traders’ Association engaged 10
tour-horse drags to rumble around and con-
vey customers to and from the bargain sales
tree of charge, if you please. The inhabi-
tant m quest of goods had only to hail a
drag and be picked up. All drags drove to
Lliapel-street, and all Chapel-street was offer-
ing the necessaries and luxuries of life at
less than cost. And one could get there
without paying any fare. With so much
joy-iiding about the atmosphere of picnic
was almost overpowering.
i j Hilly Chisholm has been bagged
J -L.YV. for a junior lead in “The Maid of
the Mountains.” Two of his dresses for the
snow cost 50 guineas apiece—it sounds like
Julius Knight or a pampered prima donna.
Mrs. Langlands Thompson and her family
returned home from Her Majesty’s panto
tile other night in a taxi. Meanwhile a
coupie of motor-robbers, finding the expen-
sive Thompson limousine unchaperoned in
a public thoroughfare, went off for a joy-
ride and had not returned when this was
written. The incident reminds one that you
can t refer to Mrs. Langlands Thompson’s
household in a hurry. Her children (all
by her first husband) are all Langlands
Jacks. She herself is Langlands Thompson,
and her second politician-husband, having no
interest in the name Langlands, is plain
Thompson.
Louis Esson’s book of Australian plays,
including the new hit, “The Drovers,” seems
to have convinced Old England of the possi-
bilities of Australian dramatists. Several
English papers have astounded the modest
author with the eulogy they can lavish on
a comparatively unknown man. R. J. Far-
jeon, analysing “The Drovers,” calls it a
masterpiece, and Far jeon is not accus-
tomed to use such language. To complete
Esson’s bliss he has had cheers from John
Masefield, Yeats and other notable littera-
teurs. Yeats declares that Louis is sure to
be “a powerful and successful dramatist” —
and in bigger plays, too.
The Argus says that the anklet watch for
ladies is now much worn, but ventures to
wonder how the wearer contrives to see the
time. She cannot, of course; but it is a
great convenience for the men.
Harrison Owen has already found his feet,
in London. He is doing much work for the
Manchester Despatch— including leaders
that are wired to Manchester nightly and
appear the following morning—and London
Opinion recently announced that “Harrison
Owen, the well-known writer for the Sydney
Bulletin, has promised us another of his
clever stories.” He is finding the way of the
freelance easy.
Sister Adelaide’s P.S.:—
Governor-General Forster arrived on Friday for
the Test Match, and is staying with the Weigalls
at Marble Hill. Both G.-G. and the local potentate
are so enthusiastic about cricket that, at the con-
clusion of the Test, they will pick an-eleven apiece
and play a match.
Mrs. George Bagot left by the Morea. No
Adelaide woman has done more for the soldiers, and
there was an unusual throng at the Outer Harbor to
see her off.
Gordon Short, a Conservatorium student, who was
one of the three Adelaide young men detained in
Germany at the outbreak of war, has returned, bring-
ing a learned wife with him. On Saturday the couple
left for Maoriland, where he. will join H. 11. Davies,
a former violinist of Adelaide, now resident at
Wellington. They intend to form a Conservatorium
there.
South Australia’s first private owner of an aero-
plane is Keith Power, formerly of Georgetown, now
staying at the Grand Central. He has bought an
Avro.
Major Lance Lewis, son of John, M.L.C., has won
the promise of Greta Laidlaw, who was over recently
from Victoria on a visit to Adelaide.
The T. Barr-Smiths flit to England shortly. So
do ex-Mayor Glover, his wife and daughter Thelma.
Elder, Smith and Co. have unveiled their honor-
roll, with 186 names of active-service men (31
killed). T. E. Barr Smith presided at the ceremony,
chairman Peter Waite, now a very old man, not being
able to attend. But the roll is entirely his gift.
The co. thinks it possibly the largest and finest
ornamental bronze casting in Australia. Walter Bagot
designed it, and the Dobbie Co. cast it. It weighs
nearly a ton, and has a heavy backing of N. S. Wales
marble.
Almost the only way of losing one’s life on the
Adelaide beaches is to dash into water too shallow.
A reckless visitor, one hot night lately, went to the
Glenelg baths, climbed on the rail at the shallow
end, and dived about 26ft. —into 2ft. of water. He
left with a broken neck.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
The Tirranna meeting on Friday and
Saturday was a tremendous success and at-
tracted not only the resident nobility and
gentry of Goulburn, but all who ever bad
figured as nobles or squires in the district.
The veteran Billy Manning (he married an
Osborne and went to the war with the
Methusaliersl won the event of the day on
Friday aboard H. L. Austin’s Purser. Mr.
Manning has been winning Bachelor’s Bags
in one part of N. S. Wales and another since
the beginning- of the century. Arthur
Allen’s son-in-law, Ken Austin, the other
crack, failed to land a winner, for a wonder;
but all was atoned for in the eyes of the
crowd when Wally Gunn’s Ivolapore rolled
home at an outside price in the last race.
The owner is the hon. sec. of the club and
immensely popular. The ball occurred the
same evening, and Faithfulls, Ryries, De
Laurets, Campbells, Chisholms, also a Dight
or so and a few Osbornes made merry in
the famous Pavilion, which corresponds as
a haunt of gaiety to the old Pump Room at
Bath, the Paris Opera House and so forth.
An interesting party of the week was the
farewell to Mrs. Kingsmill Shaw at the
'' aratah. The tea was a Kentucky picnic—
every woman her own hostess. But this
didn’t damp the enthusiasm of those met to
cheer the little lady when the cheque for a
hundred guineas subscribed by her friends
was handed to her. Miss Preston Stanley, of
the Feminist Club, did the honors, and the
big top-room of the Waratali was crowded
with old pupils and friends of Mrs. Shaw,
who has been one of Sydney’s most artistic
singing teachers for 40 years. She was born
in Sydney in a house at the corner of Eliza-
beth and Liverpool streets, where her mother,
also a gifted musician, carried on the fashion-
able school of tha day. Mrs. Kingsmill
Shaw, then Clara Cousens, studied grand
opera under Sara Flower, and voice produc-
tion with Julius Benedict, one of London’s
most famous masters. Left a widow -with
four children at an age when the modern
girl is just thinking of matrimony, she be-
came a teacher of singing and was one of the
staff in the famous young ladies’ seminary in
Rosebank-street. The indomitable handful
of a woman carried on her teaching until a
week or two ago. She sailed on Saturday
by the Benalla for Milan, where her daughter
Ethel Carrara and her grand-daughter Nellie
are engaged in operatic work.
The swank wedding of last week took
place at the Synagogue, with Rabbi Cohen
acting as master of the picturesque Jewish
ceremonial. The bride was war-widow
Mrs. Frank Michaelis (he was a sergeant
m the A.1.F.) and a daughter of the Charles
Harts, of Lome, Pott’s Point. Eric Bren-
don, who comes from Melbourne, undertook to
provide her with diamonds for the rest of
her natural life. The bride looked like a
pink-lined shell on silver sand in her rosy
taffeta and silver lace and her veil of pink
tulle and silver gauze. Bibs Benjamin, in
cream lace and carrying blue delphiniums,
was bridesmaid; Alroy Cohen was best
man. Tribesman Alfred Phillips lent Como,
in Macleay-street, for the wedding flutter,
at which the bride’s mother did the honors
in navy-blue georgette, a black hat, and a
cluster of golden chrysanthemums.
So Queensland has decided to sell the old
Lucinda. The lamentable tidings will tug
at the heartstrings of many a Bananalander
at home or in exile. To the generation before
last and the one just beginning to grey at
the temples, the handsome old paddle-
wlieeler was something more than a mere
vehicle for water-travel. She was an insti-
tution, social and political, and much of
Queensland’s, or, at any rate, Brisbane’s
domestic and public history is wrapped up
m her. She had her beginnings in those
splendid days when, unless you were con-
nected with sheep and cattle, your existence
on this planet was not even admitted by
those who were. She was then “the Gov-
ernor’s private yacht,” and George Bowen
and the Musgraves made her timbers sacro-
sanct, conferring social acceptance on those
invited to tread her plankings. Dinners,
luncheons and moonlight picnics down the
river and in the quiet bay were features
af Brisbane Government House life.
Mot until the rather wowseristic Lady
Norman came in did the politicians creep
on board. Some Premier or other found
that Cabinet secrets leaked out less if dis-
cussed on the Lucinda in the wide waters
of Moreton Bay. Then members of Parlia-
ment got into the habit of borrowing the
scow from a grateful country jto take a
mob of constituents for a blow.
Lamington’s reign restored the tarnished
tone of the old hooker, whatever it may have
done for her morals. He once took her on
a tour as far as Thursday Island, and—
well, never mind. But the politicians got
hold again, and one day the unique spectacl?
of a Cabinet Minister being told to walk
the plank—and doing it—was seen. Wully
Kidston, a good pirate spoiled by politics,
was having an unhappy time with his
Cabinet, of which Digby Denham was a
member and a rebellious one. Wully ordered
a Cabinet parade one morning on the
Lucinda to fight the thing out, and when
Denham walked down the gang-plank the
man from Falkirk met him and promptly
ordered him off the boat. To Denham’s
demand for an explanation Wully only replied
with an emphatic “Get oot.” and Denham
“got oot” —of the Lucinda and the Cabinet.
Kidston fixed things up with the other insuv-
rectionaries on the way down the river.
The woman who is just back says that
long sleeves and' higher necks and pear-
shaped pearls are the last word in Paris
evening wear. The wide-flowing sleeve, or
else the extremely tight model, is encoun-
tered in the dinner-gown or its more formal
sister. The Sydney woman describes a frock
worn by Galli-Curei at a dinner-party: it
combined a trained skirt of black broadcloth
and a bodice of white lace continued into
long flowing sleeves. Black broadcloth is
the best style for emphasising the white lace
of an evening model. The jazz girl still
sticks to her tulle or chiffon dancing-frock,
though even on these the touch of black
seems essential, and is generally introduced
in_ jet, Chantilly or taffeta. The uneven
skirt-hem is the newest note, and in lace or
tulle gives rather a rags-and-tatters effect.
Velvet comes back to its own, mostly in
dark greens and sapphire blues, and the
wise woman always has a little frock of this
uncrushable fabric stuck about with tufts
of glorified bunny ready to her hand. Paris
says big. hats and straggly trimmings, mostly
to the right side. Velvet and feathers make
alluring millinery, but the feathers must be
arranged to arch over the top of the hat
and droop over each ear. And there are
threats of the old, defiant, prickly coclc’s-
feather boa once more.
Ivy Curtis, an only chick from East Kew,
Melbourne, has promised to marry Henry T.
Jacob, of Mosman and Goulburn.
Enough women get married to the wrong
man without the help of this Letter, so it
hurries to unwed Janie McCabe from Mr.
Shaw and hand her over to Philip Way,
whom she married on January 5 at St.
Mark’s in the broad light of noon, Tom
Lamb being best man, and Dr. Jenkins giv-
ing the bride away. She was married in a
blue dress and a smart hat, and the affair
was extremely quiet. If there ever had been
a Mr. Shaw, which there never was, he would
feel sorry that he missed the bride.
Julia Caroli is back in the Sydney she left
as Julia Davis when she was a little girl.
She went off to Italy with a leggiere, and
comes back with a lyric soprano. This
is her second
return to Syd-
n e y—she first d i d
it with the Quin-
lan Opera Company
to sing the Doll in
“Tales of Hoffmann”
and other parts.
Julia, who studied in
Milan with Adele
Borghi and Agnos-
tino Fossati (Mas-
cagni’s show pupil),
has made a number
of appearances in
London and on the
Continent in such
big parts as Mignon,
Gil d a and Mar-
guerite. She can
also sing the simpler
things, as shown by her success at the
Chappell Ballad, the Landon Ronald and the
Sunday Promenade Concerts. Here she in-
tends to sing with the orchestra and later
to give a short concert season. For the rest
she is small and dimpled, and has the warm
coloring of a ripe nectarine. On face values
alone Sydney will like her. Her sister was
on the Australian stage as Daisy Davis. She
is now Mrs. Don Hay, of Penrith.
Dr. C. N. Pitt, youngest son of the R. M.
Pitts, of Wentworth Falls, was married in
London on Wednesday of last week to
Gladys Collins. There was a reception at
20 Sloane Gardens, S.W., where the bride’s
parents live. Dr. Pitt was for two and a
half years’ resident surgeon at the Royal
Naval Air Station, Roehampton, and for the
remainder of the war on H.M.S. Cordelia,
stationed at Scapa Flow. He has a sign
out now at No. 6 Trevor-square, London.
Mrs. Arthur Muggridge—her late husband
was R. M. Pitt’s co-managing director of
Son and Badgery firm—leaves
for Europe with daughter Enid by the Nar-
kun'da on its next sailing—some time in
March.
Minnie Himmeloch, of Darling Point
niade the usual promises to Andrew Camp-
bell on December 21 at Colombo.
Dnbbi Cohen collected another wedding
tee last week, when Lurline Cohen, of Cen-
tennial Park, became Mrs. Louis Joachim, of
Melbourne. Ivory satin and georgette com-
bined with real duchesse point formed the
wedding dress; and a beautiful Brussels lace
vei! was a feature of the bride’s outfit,
fir end a Cohen and Ada Joachim were brides-
maids in pink and blues. The ceremony
was at the Great Synagogue. Sargent’s
provided the wedding meats.
Of course it is a nurse that has snapped
up the tall, shy and adorable Charlie Bean.
I.hose nurses get all the nice men. Her
name is Toung, and she has been at the
Gueanbeyan hospital. The wedding of cop-
per-top and his lady takes place at the end
or the month.
Here you have an up-to-the-minute photo-
graph of Ola Humphrey, who created the
part of Lady Blakeney in “The Scarlet Pim-
pernel in Australia, and was considered
one of the best that
ever played the
part. The present
is Ola’s third visit
t o Australia, her
first being with
“The Squaw Man” ;
now she is with
Captain Broadwood,
her husband. A
former one, if you
remember, was
Prince Hassan, who
died of influenza at
Barcelona (whi c h
was rather an
appropriate place for
the breaking-up of a
knut). Now, although
Ola’s title of Prin-
cess has been rati-
fied in Letters Patent by the British Gov-
ernment, she prefers to be called Mrs.
Broadwood. She has descended on Sydney
with bewildering Paris confections, which
she calls frocks, that catch the rich color-
ing of the Orient in flashes of embroidery
and exquisitely-worked motifs. Her jewels
seem like the overflow from the treasure-
chests of Aladdin’s Cave; she has strings
of amber and jade that swing to the knee,
and some pear-shaped diamonds worth a
Sinn Feiner’s ransom. Her flat at Dnrling
Point is hung with wonderful rugs and bits
of tapestry. With it all she has the true
Venetian coloring—Titian hair, creamy
skin, hazel eyes. And her feet would have
made Cinderella curl with envy—exquisite,
arched things, melting into a model ankle;
the whole fitting cosily into a No. 1 shoe.
J. D. Fitzgerald has just learned by cable
that lie is a grandfather. Daughter Ara,
who is Mrs. John Clarke, just saved her bov
from being eligible to become President
of the United States by staying in London
with her mother while her husband is con-
quering America with his “Monsieur Beau-
caire.’’ It is possible that during the year
Ara and the infant may come to Australia
If so Sydney may hope to hear the songbird
that took Milan by storm.
The Orchestral concert on Saturday night
was again given in the Conservatorium. Ver-
brugghen restrained his native impulse to
make speeches, but retaliated on the audience
by giving his orchestra a free leg in his fan-
tasia of British Sea Songs. There were other
composers on the programme, Such as Mozart,
Wagner, Elgar, Howells and Alfred Hill.
Alfred contributed four short work's, marked
with the charm and freshness of all the little
man’s compositions. Elsy Treweek sang,
and Trixie Tang did some neat work at the
piano.
Maggie and Lena Chisholm are doing a
round of the halls in London, and the audi-
ences out at Hammersmith and at the Palla-
dium gave the two Australian girls a great
reception. Their turn is described by a girl
friend as “artistic and refined.” Maggie
and Lena have chummed up with Lorna and
Toots Pounds, and Dame Nellie has been
sweetness itself to the Queenslanders.
Madaline Collins has got back to old form in
London, and Beecham was so pleased with her
that he forgave her the horrible failure she
had made of Musetta on her first night of
“Bohfeme.” As a mark of special grace he
allowed her to sing Musetta on the final even-
ing. when the Sydney girl let the critics see
what she really could make of the part.
The Williamsons—Mrs. J.C.W. and Tootles
—were lately at Nice, and in their party was
Mrs. Frank Milner, whose major-husband is
a brother of the Lord’s. (That sounds like
the Salvation Army, doesn’t it?) Tootles is
tasting all the joys of being an “Australian
heiress” and is having all sorts of parties, at
which titles and attached millionaires are two
a penny. But Tootles’s great idea is to get
back to Australia and one day have a
station of her own.
Bobbie Burns is having an -inl-
and the Highland Society is giving th/TT’
of the sweet singer a great night at the Con 6
servatonum on the 25th u 11 ne -,V°, n '
filled with the atmosphere of bLI" 1 b< i
heather; and Burns in song and Ze" 11
with an address by Walter Bentley wfli mi
up the evening. ’ Wlli
Talking of Burns recalls the enitanb
posed by an American preacher l
Ingersoll, whose brain he admired i„,t i , beic
lack of fa i til he deplored Tied whltT
would consider a suitable inscription 1 for
Ingersoll s monument the doctor with i ,in
little smile replied: “Robert Burns” J
And that brings up a vision of a Svdnev
motor-hearse which, having been duly licensed
as the law requires, goes through the streets
sfgn n “LI.“ S ’ ltS C ° rpSe and ’ olltside ’ the
Captain Broadwood, the tall and sedate-
looking Englishman who is Ola Humphreys
husband, evidently disagrees with the one
just man from Melbourne who lately told
the Age about the new Babylon’s sinfulness
Somebody asked him the other day what lie
thought of Sydney. He looked around the
Winter Garden and replied thoughtfully
r.?, yd i n i- ey ~ 0h ’ , wel1 ’ H mi " ht bri "fiten up 'if
caught m a shower of Tabasco.” Tabasco
is the sauce of which even an Anglo-Indian
can bear only one drop.
Miss Peacock, of the Roycroft Library
back in Sydney after a jaunt across America
and through England, and glad to be in the
land of plenty, says that one night she was
dining at Sherry’s, and, looking arornul
observed that while all the women wore
backless and sleeveless dresses, there wasn’t
one present showing even the tip of an ear
Why said she, “do all the women loop
their hair over their ears?” Her old-
tashioned hostess replied reproachfully:
Y\ ouldn t you have them reserve something
for their husband s eyes?”
The D. R. Halls are back in Sydney and
at the Ivimo Hats in Phillip-street. When
David went agent-generaling they sold their
Rose -Bay home to the Innes-Noads.
Colonel James Sclater, D. 5.0., is coming
this way as passenger agent for the Union
b.c>. Co. I-he Colonel, who moved early
from the Shetlands to Canada, left Van-
couver for the Great War as a captain ; after-
wards—he is a great marksman—he ran
schools for snipers in Italy, France and
England. On his return to Canada the
cutish Columbia Government gave him a
job as prohibition commissioner; but ship-
ping-man Holdsworth, when in Vancouver
lately, thought Australia and the co. could
do with him nicely.
Sydney took its best girl (or somebody
else s) through the beautiful Botanic Gar-
dens to the Domain Baths on Saturday and
spent the afternoon watching the Pacific
Islanders prove that Hawaii rules the waves-
and the shyness of the two visitors and their
rush to get away from the crowd made the
Australian lookers-on glad that, since our
own mermen couldn’t win, the champion-
ships went to such modest youngsters. There
was a roll-up of thousands, enthusiastic old-
timers being well to the fore. Justice James
(who is president of a surf club), Hilton
Mitchell and Walter Bethel (the lions of
swimming in N. S. Wales Education Depart-
ment) , James Taylor (president) and prettv
Doris Duane (Mrs. Harry Cohen) were
among the thousands.
The report, mentioned last week, that Mrs.
Whiteman is down from Rabaul isn’t as true
as her relations wish it was. She isn’t in
Sydney and doesn’t expect to be for some
time to come. By the way, the para-
grape which followed the reference to Mrs.
YVlnteman was about “a pretty little
woman, unnamed. Mrs. Whiteman, of
course, isn’t that pretty little woman. She.
as a matter of fact, is a handsome big
woman. The two items were quite dis-
tinct.
A Brisbane postscript:—•
The C. A. B. Campions (he is London manager
of the Commonwealth Bank) are visiting Brisbane
after an absence of 25 years, and were entertained
at the National Hotel on Friday by Mrs. Dalby and
Miss Thynne. Purple asters and asparagus plumosus
were the decorations. The Thynne and Dalby fami-
lies came in force, and in the large crowd were
Judge and Mrs. Real, General and Mrs. J. Cannan,
1 -M. Hurd and his wife and daughters, Mrs. Stanley
Chapman, and Mrs. J. J. Walsh.
Various offers of public receptions were made to
Conan Doyle and politely rejected. The City Council
wanted to officially welcome him, but he compromised
on a visit to the Mayor and a tour round the city.
He and Lady Doyle have also lunched with the
Governor and had morning tea with Mrs. Kathleen
YY atson Dearden. The members of the Johnsonian
Club lunched the visitor, but meanly left their
wives at home.
At All Saints’ Church Helen Archdall, only daughter
of the Mervyn Archdalls, was married to Roy Green-
wood, son of Dr. C. Greenwood, of Melbourne. White
georgette relieved with hand-made pink posies was
worn by the bride. Ena Muller, in shell pink, and Hope
Mackenzie, in powder blue, were the bridesmaids,
he guests were entertained at Soho after the wed-
ing- Sydney, Fiji and Maoriland are to be included
in the wedding tour—if the stewards are willing.

[poison]
Every square foot of land is valuable
now-a-days—far too valuable to be taken
up by scrub and weeds. Why should
they sap the vitality out of ground which
should contribute to your storehouse or
granary ?
Have you a clearing problem—is any
of your land being usurped by undesir-
able weeds ? Then there’s no earthly
reason why they should remain there
any longer. You have a speedy, sure,
and economical means of cutting short
their existence.
"VALLO” BrandWeed
Scrub and Tree Killer
will clean them off like a bush fire, with
the difference that they go for good.
“Vallo” is not an experiment. It is an
absolute exterminator of any and every
kind of Noxious Growth. It’s demon-
strating its efficiency every day. Whether
your trouble be giant trees or- common
sorrel put “Vallo” on the job and you’ll
be impressed by what it can do.

Steyiie: Why worry to criticise Carl
Sandburg? Well, for one very good reason because the
American front-rank literary critic who chooses
“the month’s most characteristic American book”
for The Bulletin chose Sandburg for November.. . .
Trion: Very fair; but that section is more crowded
than m05t....475: So bad that its badness almost
amounts to genius O. U. Twest: It hovered on
the edge; but it was a bit too mechanical to go the
right way... . Rechercheur: One has the old-age and
the other the invalidity pension... .Concave: It’s
been fastened on to many more likely men.... Chloe:
To show that Jap and Koepanger are not cousins you
say the Koepanger is a Malay with a cross of
Mongol. Well, the Japanese is a Mongol with an
infusion of Malay D.R. (Melb.) : So stiff in the
joints it couldn’t reach the tomb without a drop of
ojl to go on with.... Fred O.: Misses the ’bus
Ralph Y.: It is rubbish.. . .8.F.E.: “Wishing Tree”
is vefy thin above and shaky below II.B.: (East
St. K.) : Pretentious commonplace.... Sydney B.:
Crude stuff.... Grey Day: Poor. And it doesn’t help
at all to send copy in that unclean state.... Hep:
Doesn’t say anything except that we’re interested in
cricket. .. .11.A.5.: Not enough in it. . . .E.G.
(Waterfall): The worst of the week.... Old Pard:
No good.. ..Elsa F.: Too shadowy N.H.T.:
Nothing new, nothing said well. . . .K.K. : Nicely
written, but hardly the interest to carry it. .. .
A.D.P.: Not enough in “Shadow of the Pines”....
Richard: Horse yarn very tedious... .G.F.D.:
Chaucer is best left alone. Nobody will see him
in a loose paraphrase which takes the edge off the
thoughts... .R.H.: Let the fine thing spread its
wings:—
The majority of rich just sit and chaff;
At the humble they talk and laugh ;
Why was such a curse as money invented,
Or why wasn’t it used just as intended?
Some have made money just by good fortune
Others have lost it just by misfortune;
Some men have made money and won great fame,
Others have money all through a name.
I wonder if all were humbled and put to the test,
If all were asked to do their best
If all were the same in store,
I wonder who’d be first asking for more,
Whether it would be the humble poor,
Or those that are used to a boundless store.
Oh, what a bit of heaven it would be
If all were to live without such a thing as money!
If all could live in happiness
And all the beauties of this world suppress;
If all were kind, gentle, and loving—
Wouldn’t it be a life worth living!
I . ... Kayo: That idea of going to a place where you
were once drunk and reviewing the past has been
done 17,569 times. .. .K.N.M. : Doesn’t strike us. .. .
Barli: Not usable A.F.R.: All out of tune
Frank R.: Doesn’t make a yarn... .S.S.D.: “The
Great Gift” is simply a string of commonplaces with-
out rhythm. .. .A. Nonsensus: Been printed already.
. ...G.0.T.: “Not Darkness, Light” is gross dark-
ness considered as a poem... ,F.§.: “Love and War”
doesn t appeal to u 5.... A.L.S.: Not up by some dis-
tance 1.M.C.: The verse is not bad, but it is
rather du11.... Peter S.: Nothing in it C.R.M.:
Hardly.... Dungaree: “Riddle Riddle” goes wearily.
H.G.C.: Try to get something to say P.S.T.:
N 0.... Soraux: The verse is all over the place and
the matter doesn’t shout for print. .. .S. (North
Carlton): Not up... .P.M.F.: If you must write a
drunk yarn it is best to do it when you are sober.
. ...J.McC.: Pleasantly jingling commonplace....
Stay-at-home: A long way to go to get there
Hamish: Nice little moral tale with all the interest
of a bar of soap.... W.F.8.: Very rugged.... Kalic :
Awful Lancewood: An old thing that has been
done often. Try to see something for yourself
J. (New Farm): Better; you’re improving....
A.J.L.: There’s a hint of something worth while.
Don t use words without knowung their meaning..
E.L.P. (Nowra) : Nothing in them Baby B.: It
goes to pieces after the second verse... .F.R.G.: It
could all be put into a 10-line paragraph. And then
we doubt whether it would be worth printing.
Oiange and G.: Well, what do you suggest that
Australia should do? T.S.:’Why don’t you write
of the little things you know about? Any hack at
a city desk could write about the things you’ve
wasted time upon Crisp: If you must steal, do
it with discretion. We don’t remember all we’ve
ever printed, but we do remember more of that than
of what all the other people have printed.... Blister:
We won’t quarrel with him about Hungerford, which
straddles the border; but Caiwarra is certainfy
several miles on the Queensland side of the fence....
Jack B.: No he wasn’t. But he was the M.O. of
that district.... Levearra: Not well enough done
to atone for the lateness of it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H.C.McIv.: We’ll overlook the drawings, but won’t
forgive you for exhuming the two old jokes. .. .F. H.
(aged 15) : Is it a sample of what you did 10
years ago?... .I.B.: A collection of tangled per-
spectives... .A.E.K.: Not good enough.... Vic. * S.:
All miss; dig out better jokes and try again....
H.D.L.: Art did not provide your passage money,
did it?
“J.E.” on the offensive:—
After reading the defence of the Queensland Gov-
ernment by Randolph Bedford, one of its nominees
in the Upper House (B. 13/1/’2l), I wouldn’t have
his job of chronic white-washer to that ludicrous
institution for all the asphalt in the Dead Sea. Said
Government has turned the best-paying railway
system of Australia into the worst;' put up the
heaviest local record for taxation; gone down with
the worst wallop over the biggest attempted loan
( £9,000,000) and offered the poorest explanation,
and played the anguished goat all round. Mr. Bed-
ford defends it on the ground that it inherited
troubles from its wicked predecessors, Philp, Ridston
and Denham. In proof he laboriously quotes one
property (and no more) which some predecessor
purchased for £32,000 so far back that no interest
has been charged on it for 10 years. Even if this
should prove a total loss, as the white-washer says
■t will, after half a decade of Theodore’s manage-
ment, it is only about lOd. per inhabitant. “If
the. fathers have eaten sour grapes the children’s-
teeth can’t help being set on edge,” says the sen-
tentious Bedford. But if the fathers ate one sour
berry among them 10 or 20 years ago that doesn’t,
account for the teeth of 737,085 children being set
on edge. If one can judge by the railwavs, I
should say that any estate might show a loss' now
even if Philp or somebody had bought it for Id.
perj mile.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BROTHER mine, when all is past,
Shall you win your dream at last?
Could you etch the souls of men,
With the needle of your pen,
Ever yet and ever yet
Still would creep the long regret
From the spent and spectral years,
Sweet with smiles and happy tears.
Long ere Fate’s grey lore you learned,
When the yellow autumns burned
Still as beacons in a dream,
Song and sweet of youth supreme
Filled your soul that ne’er bad yet
Known me bitter of regret,
Ne’er had felt the brooding sea,
Loneliness of Destiny.
Then ere ever Love came lipped
Like a deep rose, honey-tipped
Aye, ere ever phantom-wise
From a woman's wistful eyes
Laughed that light whose shade is yet
One ineffable regret,
Swift and glad with vibrant pen
You would tell your dreams to men.
O’er an altar without name
Flared the scented bridal flame,
And your bride the siren song,
Who loves once loves late and long,
Then your eyes, dream-blinded yet,
'Held no shadow of regret;
Sea and sky were yours to sing,
Rich with Tyrian coloring.
Poppies of the morning light
Rosed with red and silken white
Seemed the songs of youth you spun,
Shining petals in the sun ;
Amber shallows, holding yet
Pain nor passion nor regret;
Deeps where mirrored light became
Changeful emerald and flame.
Ah! but all the furtive tears,
Born of shame and gnawing fears,
Wept of eyes that only see
Mocking Life’s sad irony;
All that frets and festers yet
In the wounds of grey regret,
Brother mine, the waiting woe
Of your manhood bade you know.
Then wine-red and red as blood
Drove vour song’s tumultuous flood;
Passion leapt white-fanged and smote
From those lips the careless note
Of your matin music; yet
From the flame of fierce regret,
From the crucible of pain,
Deathless, shone your dreams again.
Roses of the red moon’s flame,
Crimson-fierce your words became.
Blood drops from a stricken heart,
With intense and poignant art,
Tinct with fire that glimmers yet,
Through the mists of drab regret—•
Fire of changeless hopes that flare
Down the ages of despair!
Royal o’er the roaring throng
Reat the banners of your song;
You had learned, ah ! you had learned
From the moulding griefs that burned,
From the fires that smouldered yet :
From the scourging of regret,
Of your craft a deeper lore,
Tried and proven o’er and o’er.
Brother, of all lures which are
You have sought one dream, one star,
Through youth’s sweet, through storm and
stress,
And your dream was happiness!
Nearer glows it, sweeter yet,
Through the twilight of regret.
Brother mine, when all is past
You shall win your dream at last!
QUEENSLAND.

Officers’ Duties.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Officers should at all times do all in their power
to promote the welfare and comfort of the passen-
gers.”—“lnstructions to Officers.”
HE was one of those fluffy, dainty,
golden-haired little blondes, with large
appealing brown eyes, and that look
of pathetic helplessness which makes the
average man want to pick them up and hug
them; and as I made my usual morning
round of the ship I noticed that she was lean-
ing over the rail by herself, and looking
rather lonely. This appeared to be one of
the times when I should do all in my power
to promote the comfort of one of the pas-
sengers, and I considered it my instant duty
to go over and entertain her. More especi-
ally as I noticed that one of the male pas-
sengers, a man with a predatory eye and
the reputation of being something of a “lady
killer,” was standing off and on in the offing
and looking as though he were preparing
to run down and board. So I went over to
the rail and said “Good morning.”
She smiled up at me at once, and said,
“Oh, I have just been wishing ” (she was the
sort of girl who emphasises every other
word when talking, and underlines it when
writing)—“l have just been wishing that
you would come over and talk to poor little
me. I am so lonely. I haven’t spoken to
a soul for ten minutes.”
I said that I was sorry to hear that she
had felt lonely, but that I would do my
best to cheer her up.
“You know,” she went on, “this is my
very first trip on a steamer, and I am just
dying to have everything explained to me.
I do think' you sailors are so frightfully
clever. It is just ivonderful how you
find your way about at night. What is
that cunning little clock-thing for? I do
think it is so cute!”
She pointed to the patent log which was
revolving on the taff-rail, and I explained
the useful instrument at some length.
“How perfectly ripping!” she said when
I had finished. “.Tust fancy that all you
have to do is to look at that teeny clock, and.
you know just exactly where the ship is.
How thrilling!”
I explained that the patent log merely
registered the number of miles the ship had
run, and that there were some gather com
plicated calculations involved determining
the ship’s position, including the use ot
SC --Oh, C 'yes, I know,” she replied. “That is
that funny-looking telescope thing
you looking through this morning, isn t .
I just thought you were looking at a di:IP
or something. And that was actually a
sexton. How thrilling!”
I pointed out that there was some slight
difference between a sexton and a sextant,
but it really made no difference as she had
switched on to another subject by th
that I had got through with my explanation.
“Will you take me up on the bridge,
please?” she asked. “I’m just dying to go
up there. I am perfectly sure it must be
just lovely on the bridge.” .
I told her that there were very stringent
rules against any of the passengers being
allowed on the bridge whilst the ship was
at sea, but if she were to ask the captain
he might allow her to go up there.-
“Well, here he comes now, she replied.
“I will ask him when he comes along, i
am sure he won’t mind little me going up
there. I do think he looks such a perfect
old dear. So rippingly venerable, you know.
Don’t you think he is a dear !
I thought of the Old Man’s usual early-
morning grouch, and refrained from reply-
ing I also wondered what he would think
if he heard himself described as being rip-
pingly venerable,” as he rather fancies him-
self as a “lady’s man,” and is a bit touchy
at being considered at all ancient.
“Oh, good morning. Captain, she said as
he came near us. “Please may Mr. bhauk-
Painter take me on to the bridge ! lam
just longing to go. He may, raaynt he.
This with a smile that would have melted an
iceberg. . , .
The captain preened himself. .
“Well,” he replied, “it is really against
the rules, you know, but, er, um ah, 111
tell you what I’ll do. I’ll take you up
there myself and show you round a wt.
We can have a cup of tea in my cabin after-
wards. Er —in any case, Mr. Shank-
Painter is a bit busy just now, so, of course,
he won’t have time,” and he gave me a look
which told me that, this was where I faded
out of the picture. That was one of his
rotten ways. Whenever he saw me talking
to a pretty girl he would .come along and
say that I was very busy and had to look
after my work. And as I always had to
go he would get the girl. This time I faded
away as usual; but I made up my. mind
that' when he took her on to the bridge A
would be around, as I reckoned that he
would have all his work cut out in answer-
ing her questions. When I saw them stroll
along the deck in the direction of the bridge
I hurried along the other side, and hastily
mounting the bridge ladder pretended to be
giving the third officer some instructions as
the Old Man and the Girl came up the other
ladder. '
“How perfectly ripping! she said as she
reached the bridge. “What a scrumptious
view you get from here!.. ..Oh, is that the
wheel they steer the ship with? How tiny
it is! I do think it is so clever for the
man to be able to turn this great big ship
round just by pulling on that tiny wheel.
How strong he must be!”
The Old Man explained that the wheel
only operated a hydraulic gear, which in
turn worked the steam tiller that moved
the rudder.
“Now isn’t that horrid /” she said when
he had finished. “Fancy having a horrid
old steam thing to steer with. I do think
steam is so unromantic, don’t you?”
The skipper said that he had never given
the matter any thought, but that he didn t
see how they were going to get along with-
out it very well. I fancy he was begin-
ning to feel sorry.
“What is that?” she asked, pointing to
the binnacle. The Old Man told her that
that was the compass by which the ship
was steered. _ ,
“How stunningly thrilling!” she breathed.
“I do think it is so wonderful to be able to
steer a ship just by looking into that wee
window. Which is the part that always
points to the north? Or is it. the south it
always points to? You see, I know all
about it, because my brother always wears
one on his watchcliain. Now, please,
explain all about the compass to me, will
you. Captain?”
Now it happens that several great scien-
tists. including the late Lord Kelvin, have
devoted their w r hole lives to solving the
mysteries of the mariner’s compass. And
the more they have discovered the more there
still seems to be to discover. Wherefore
many learned books have been written on
the subject. So when the Fluffy Girl asked
the captain to tell her ull about the compass
she was asking for rather a large helping.
However, the Old Man did his best, and T
heard him explaining to her the meaning of
co-efficients, induction, acquired polarity,
sub-permanent magnetism, and the like.
“How perfectly thrilling!” she said when
he had finished. “And all you have to do
is to keep that little black line uear the
compass. Why, that is just too utterly simple
for anvthing. I always thought it was
frightfully difficult to navigate a ship all
over the world, and it is realty quite easy.
I don’t think you sailors are nearly so clever
as I did. Oh, ivhat a ducky little tele-
phone! Where does it ero?”
The Old Man rather gruffly replied that
it went down to his cabin, so that if neces-
sary he could speak to the watch-officer
at night through it.
“How perfectly sweet!” she said. Just
to think that if you feel lonely, and can’t
sleep, you can always ring the officer up. I
think that’s just lovely!” _
I hurriedly left the bridge at this juncture,
as I noticed that the quartermaster ap-
peared to be chokina. whilst the skipper was
on the verge of apoplexy.
* ♦ V
I did not see uer again until after dinner
that evening, when she was leaning, over the
rail by herself. She saw me coming along
the deck, and buttonholed me before I could
escape. As a matter of fact. I am not at
all certain that I wanted to escape, for she
was a pretty little girl, and later on, when
she had got tired of asking questions
“Well.” I said, “what is it you want to
know all about now?”

ZAM-
POWERS AGAIN PROVED.
WRITING from his home, 176 York Street, Launceston, Tas., Mr. F. Campbell, whose photo
accompanies, says:— Three years ago I met with an accident whilst at Flinders Island. I
was chopping some wood, when a piece flew up and hit me on the shin-bone, inflicting a
parntul injury. The dye from my sock got into the wound, which became inflamed and festered. The
leg swelled enormously, the pain bemg dreadful. I could get no relief nor sleep at night, but would
toss about in agony. I commenced to treat myself, but the remedies I applied did not suit me. I
altogether about £5 in different ointments, but I could get no relief.

I therefore took my friend’s advice and gave Zam-Buk a trial. The first application gave me the
greatest ease. I had used poultices of different kinds, but they were like the other applications, and
P od - 1 was 80 encouraged that I kept on with the Zam-Buk treatment, and although I had
thirty ulcers on my leg, Zam-Buk healed them all splendidly, and I do not suffer at all with my
leg now. J

Come afid tell me all about the stars,” she
answered. That was one thing I admired
about her. She didn’t believe in any half-
knowledge. She wanted to know all about
ei ery thing.
ahead, I said. “What is it you
wa ut to know about first?”
“Show me the North Star,” she demanded
promptly.
I pointed out that, owing to an unfortu-
nate curvature of the earth’s surface, it
w as quite impossible to see the Pole Star
south of the equator. She was frankly dis-
appointed, and said so. She rather implied
tnat 1 w r as responsible. “But never mind,”
she added magnanimously. “Show me
Orion’s Belt.”
1 i u Xp A*y. ned that . durin S this particular
montii Orion and his Belt were only visible
during the early hours of the morning, and
that if she wanted to see him she would
have to rise about 4 a.m.
.‘‘ We |s> 1 do think you’re moan," she
said. ‘lou won’t show me a single star I
have asked you to. I don’t believe you know
any of the old stars at all. Tell me the
names of all the stars.”
1 informed her that out of all the stars
that were visible to the eye only a very few
had names.
“I think it is so wonderful ,” she said,
how you are able to read the names of all
those stars when they are so far away. I
think it is just thrilling"
After a silence of some minutes I thought
to please her by pointing out the Southern
Cross, but she evidently knew that much
over-rated constellation.
“Pooh ! Everyone knows the old Southern
Cross, and the ‘pointers’ too. The ‘pointers’ ”
she added, “were put there so that you
CO mu tell which the Southern Cross is.”
Ihere was another silence for some
minutes, during which I reflected how much
obliged the astronomers ought to be, and
racked my brains for something to talk
about.
YY hat I always think is so ivonderful,"
she remarked at length, “is how you sailors
manage to steer by the stars. Do tell me
how it is done. I have so often wondered.”
\“ ld that it: wasn’t done at all, and
that the ship was always steered by the com-
pass.
Ihat silly old thing the captain was try-
m S to tell me about this morning?” she
asked contemptuously. “Why, I thought
that was only used during the daytime, when
you couldn t see the stars.”
I explained the matter to the best of my
ability, and went over some of the ground
ing Ched 0n k y t^le s kiPP er during the morn-
khe thought this over for several minutes,
uud then remarked somewhat irrelevantly
Don t you think Mary Pickford is too
sweet for anything?” And I knew that the
time was ripe.
■L°°k here,” I said, “I know a nice quiet
little spot up on the boat deck, just made for
two. What about studying the stars from
there ? No one ever goes up there,” I
added as an afterthought.
“You’re pile sure no one would see me
if I went?” she asked.
“Absolutely sure,” I replied.
, ; Well—if I go you must promise faith-
fully to behave yourself.” I gave the re-
quired assurance.
All right, then. W ait till I get my coat.”

Whom God Hath Joined.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Old Woman was dead. Her sons
were grieved—almost as upset as
when the old sow had died, instead
of continuing to provide them with a small
fortune each year.
The fact of their loss was brought fully
home to them on the morning after the
funeral, when all neighbors had departed,
and, coming in with the milk, after being
out since daybreak, they had to light a fire
and wash pails and dishes and separator
before preparing their own breakfast. At
i m » er * le cb °P, s > galled by Bob, the younger
brother, were charred and raw, the potatoes
hard and uneatable; at tea-time they finished
the bread kindly baked for them two days
before by Mrs. Perkins, their nearest neigh-
bor. They thought of beds unmade, of
greasy crockery that needed washing.
WeU 'ave to get some’un,” said Bob.
Who re you goin’ to git?” growled Tom.
JJunno. Bob shook his head. “Never
thought we’d miss the Old Woman so much
Never seemed to notice ’er round; but now
.® 8 gorn”—he shook his head and spat
into the ash-heaped fireplace.
e l d rT,’ ave to Pay if we got anybody,”
grunted Tom. J ’
“Ye-es, s’pose so.”
“Bin enough expense—doctor an’ burrin'
an’ all that.”
They sat in silence smoking, now and
again raising their heads to spit.
t? ab ? ut marryin’ someone?” asked
Bob diffidently.
Silence again, while Tom thought it over
Ye-es, that might do,” he concluded. “Means
a bit o money first go off, I s’pose, bringin’
up the parson ag’in an’ that. Wisht we’d
thought of it sooner. Might ha’ got it over
when ’e was ’ere.”
e " es » s a Pity. Yeh could go down to
the church; that wouldn’t cost as much.
Who’d you ’ave? Orter be big an’ hefty.
Still, come to think of it, the Old Woman
wasn’t big. An’ there’s only us two, an’
the milk, an’ the ’ouse, an’ fowls, an’ washin’
an’ that. Wha’s matter?”
“You see ’ere! You think my missus is
goin’ ter work for you?”
“Eh? What yeh mean?”
“If I gotter go to the bother an’ expense
o’ gettin’ married I’ll find enough for my
missus to do, an’ so I’ll tell you. You’ll ’ave
to get somebody for yourself. The place’s
big enough to keep two women goin’. An’
there’s enough rooms in the ’ouse. I say,
’ow about them girls o’ Smith’s? Seen ’em
at the sale last month. Seem a likely lookin’
pair, an’ sisters wouldn’t get fightin’. I’ll
ask Smith to-morrdr, if y’ like.”
“Think they’d ’ave us?” doubtfully.
“You bet! Smith’d see to that. Think
’e wants to keep ’em eatin’ their ’eads off?”
“S’pose we’d ’ave to go down an’ see ’em,
eh ?”
“Ketch me! I’ll see what Smith says, an’
if ’e’s on I’ll let the parson know, an’ we’ll
get it over soon as we can. We’ll ’ave to
manage some’ow till then.”
Smith and his daughters being willing, one
morning a few weeks later the four young
folk set off on the 12-mile drive to the
township. The cart could carry only four
people, as Tom had taken the opportunity
to carry down a couple of boxes of eggs he
had promised the storekeeper; therefore, the
brides’ mother had to stay at home. She
had begged her husband to lend her a horse,
but he had a bit o’ reapin’ that had ter
be done.
Tom, the elder brother, sat in front and
drove. Beside him was Lizzie, the elder
of the two girls, who had naturally paired
off with him. Lizzie, plump and red, giggled
at intervals. Emma, her sister, sat with
Bob, back to back with them, clinging to
the cart, which lurched and jolted over the
bush track. Emma, perfectly self-possessed,
discussed with Bob the prospects of the har-
vest and the arrangements made for them
at the farm; Bob, his head turning often,
watched Lizzie, who giggled every time she
caught liis eye. Lizzie was dressed in pink
—Bob liked pink—and her shady hat had
cherries in it; cherries as red as her lips,
he thought. He wished Emma, his wife to
be, had chosen a pink dress, instead of that
grey thing, and he hated the feather in her
hat.
The clergyman, Mr. Lowndes, was waiting
when they arrived at the church. Several
idlers strolled in after them ; and the cere-
mony was soon over. Then, as it was
their wedding-day, they had dinner at the
hotel —an elaborate dinner of soup and roast
beef and apple-pie. Feeling happy after
that—happier than the landlord looked—
they crossed the street to the store.
“I’ll buy you a present, Emma,” said
Bob. diving deeply into his trouser pocket.
What 11 y’ave? New frock, eh?”
“Thank you, Bob,” said Emma. She
walked demurely up to a pile of prints and
selected a greyish material, with little red
horseshoes.
“Wouldn’t you like somethin’ showier —
this pink ’un—hey?”
“The grey’ll wear bettfer,” said Emma with
decision. ‘‘lt won’t show the dirt an’ be
always m the wash.” De
“Oh, very well.” Bob looked a little dis-
appointed. What’re you ’avin’ Liz’”
Lizzie looked wistfully at her husband,
who was too busy bargaining over his eggs
to notice her. “ ’Ere, let me buy you some-
like v ” n ° W y ° U re 1116 SiSt6r ‘ What ’ d J'ou
Emma frowned. “Let Tom,” she whispered,
nudging him. But Bob had taken a gay
chocolate-box from a shelf. “Like these,
Liz/ he asked. ’
Lizzie smiled gratefully, and accepted
them. Bob liked the gleam of her white
teeth between the cherry lips; he liked the
warm touch of her plump hand, when she
took the box. Thanks, Bob,” she said.
T Tom turned to them, his business finished
’TV hat you got there?” he demanded coldly
• Make youself sick with .that muck.” Then
they left the store and started homewards.
X hree months later Mr. Lowndes, the
clergyman who had married, the two couples
paid his annual round of visits through his
vast district. It was nearing night when he
drove up to the farmhouse, confident of wel-
come, food and bed. Bob came to him
hearing his call, shook hands, and took his
horse to the stable; Tom he could see
splashing face and hands with water from a
tin basin on a bench by the kitchen door
Emma was hurriedly cooking bacon and eggs,
and Lizzie laying the table, when he entered
the house.
“Well, how are you all getting on?” asked
the clergyman jovially, when they were
seated at table. “Quite happy—eh?”
“Grand!” said Bob, while Lizzie blushed
and giggled, and Emma smiled faintly.
“Lizzie an’ me suits down to the ground--
don’t we, Liz? An’ Tom an’ Emma gets
on first-rate.”
“But—but,” stammered Mr. Lowndes
‘am I mistaken? -Really, I thought it was
Lizzie I married to Tom,' and Emma to
you !’
“Oh, that’s all right,” said Bob easily,
helping himself to bread. “We did fix to
have.it that way first go-off. But on the
weddm -day we seen as we’d got mixed.
Emma was just Tom’s sort, an’ Lizzie was
mine. So when we got ’ome. we just
changed round. An’ now we’re suited fine
—ain t we, Tom ?”
“Yes,” grunted Tom, with his mouth full,
i • B ut ~ bu t” —Mr. Lowndes laid down his
knife and fork. His hair almost rose on
( j nd - ™ Then he was silent - What could he
dot Marry them over again? That might
be called bigamy! Lie looked around the
table. The four were quite happily and
healthily disposing of their food; no sense
of wrong-doing troubled them. Should he
explain the matter to them and make them
unhappy and ashamed, or had he better
wait and ask advice of the Bishop in this
unusual complication?
“More bacon, Em, please,” said Tom,
passing his plate. “You cooked it just
right. Emma smiled as she handed him a
fresh portion.
Mr. Lowndes sighed and went on quietlv
with his tea.
