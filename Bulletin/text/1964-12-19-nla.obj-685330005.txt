Extracts from Directors’ Report and Accounts 1964
A-N-Z
A*N*Z BANK
AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND BANK LIMITED
AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND SAVINGS BANK LIMITED
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“Monetary policy reached a turning point in the
latter part of 1963,” states the Hon. Sir Geoffrey C.
Gibbs, Chairman of Australia and New Zealand
Bank Limited, in the Bank’s Annual Report. Sir
Geoffrey points out that “The Reserve Bank made
a direct attack on the excess liquidity of the banking
system, and introduced firmer restraint early in
1964 by a series of calls to Statutory Reserve De-
posit . . . These moves were quickly followed by
official action to implement a more effective policy
of influencing monetary conditions through interest
rates.”
Finance of Exports- Referring to existing financial
facilities for exporters, Sir Geoffrey states that “it
has become evident that these are inadequate to
meet any significant increase in demand for finance
to facilitate exports on lengthening credit terms. To
overcome this and to provide a pool of funds to
assist individual banks in financing the export of
durable or capital goods where repayment terms
extend over more than twelve months, ‘Australian
Banks’ Export Re-Finance Corporation Limited’
was formed by the eight major trading banks.”
The Bank’s Business- “Last year advisory centres
were formed in selected branches in the capital
cities of Australia and New Zealand to give further
assistance to newcomers and to help them to settle in
unfamiliar surroundings,” states Sir Geoffrey in
reviewing the Bank’s business over the past year.
Commenting on other developments, Sir Geoffrey
adds: “A new enterprise during the past year has
been the establishment of an investment advisory
and managerial service which is now available to
customers and others. It has been designed to formu-
late and implement investment policies, act as in-
vestment manager, custodian trustee and invest-
ment adviser, and to review investment portfolios.”
In referring to the installation of the Bank’s elec-
tronic computer in Melbourne, Sir Geoffrey states:
“we fully believe this will enable a more expeditious
handling of the growing volume of work in that
centre, as well as having a further stabilising effect
on operating costs. Delivery of the equipment has
been spread with completion early in 1965, and we
expect the computer to be in operation shortly after
installation.”

The difference between modern Australian and American offices
Water Coolers!
American management has found that,
workers feel better, work better and
have higher morale when they replenish
body fluids with cool drinking water.
These are facts often stated by medical
authorities.
If you have an eye for increased em-
ployee efficiency and better employee
morale, it is to your benefit to instal a
water cooler or water coolers.
Investigate Temprite water coolers
first. There are 5 good reasons:
1. Temprite water coolers can be bought
(or rented, if you do not wish to make a
capital investment).
2. Temprite water coolers can serve from
10 to 220 employees efficiently, effect-
ively and economically.
3. There are Temprite coolers designed
for every office and plant . . . small or
large. Some models take only 1 square
foot of space. Every model can be
placed near the work area.
4. There is a five year warranty on each
Temprite.
5. Temprite is manufactured in Australia
by Kelvinator, a national name in indus-
trial refrigeration.

Chinese dragons and other age-
old Eastern customs are some
reasons why lots of Dawsons,
Smiths and Browns now go to
Europe via Hong Kong.
Other reasons include duty-free
purchase of the world’s top-quality
goods. Gay Oriental living. And
Lufthansa. r *,
Lufthansa? Yes. For at Hong
Kong you can change to Luft-
hansa and fly on to any of 50
cities in 5 continents.
But why change?
A good question. And there’s a
good answer: because Lufthansa
service is as invitingly German as
the Schwarzwald.
It means friendly, English-speak-
ing cabin crews. Refinements like
hearty German beer from the keg,
Westphalian ham, black bread.
Reliability that has set punctu-
ality records over many routes,
including the North Atlantic.
And Boeing 707 Intercontinentals,
biggest and most powerful 707’s
in service. Plus brand new Boeing
727’s and well-proven 7208’5.
Who needs a dragon to lure them
to Hong Kong. Lufthansa is lure
enough.
But what if you can’t go via
Hong Kong? No problem. Just
join Lufthansa at Bangkok, San
Francisco or Johannesburg for
almost anywhere else in the world.

Words and music
“'T'he sounds of a winery at vintage
A are quite fascinating. Within
twenty-four hours of picking, the must
is moving; it is bubbling by the second
day. The low-pitched pizzicato is usually
lost among the general noise from the
squeal of the wine press, the crack of the
straining staves and the run of the press
wine into the bucket. Adding to the
sound is the slosh of the plunger push-
ing the skins under the must, the gurgle
lof a barrel being pumped full of wine,
ior the clatter of the stalker, or must
Ipump. But through the silent dark of
I night, when the vineyard workers are at
•rest, the winemaker testing the tempera-
ture of the must, or plunging the skins
in the vats, will hear the quiet talk of
the vintage, a continuous soft crackle,
like a distant hum of many small child-
pen’s conversation.”

tthe long awaited book. “Hunter Wine”.

Blessings
<\Tone of us cares much for blessings
I ” in disguise, but the current shortage
!°f work for actors in Sydney has meant
that both players and audiences have had
a year of lively enterprise in do-it-your-
s elf theatre.
Those endeavors are culminating with
two groups of professional actors putting
on children’s plays for Christmas. The
Australian Theatre for Young People
will do Barbara Vernon’s “Hullabaloo
Belay” at St James Playhouse from Box-
ing Day, and the Q Group is playing
Edward Hepple’s version of “Dick Whit-
tington” at the AMP Theatrette.
“Dick Whittington” is the Q Group’s
seventh production. Their lunch-hour
plays this year were certainly seen by
more people than the four productions
of the Government-subsidised Old Tote.
The Australian Theatre for Young
People is making “Hullabaloo Belay” its
first big effort. Earlier it sent a version
of “She Stoops to Conquer” to tour
schools.
Miss Vernon’s play is sub-titled “The
Whitby Adventure” and tells of Captain
Cook returning to Whitby to choose a
ship for his voyage to Tahiti. It is being
produced by Nigel Lovell with Neva
Carr Glyn, Gordon Glenwright, Marion
Johns and Don Pascoe in the cast.
Miss Vernon is an experienced play-
wright and assistant radio drama editor
for the Australian Broadcasting Com-
mission. However, she said, when the
Australian Theatre for Young People
asked a dozen local writers to submit
synopses of children’s plays she was the
only one to do so. “That was probably
because local playwrights are so beaten
down,” Miss Vernon said.
Lack of encouragement, Miss Vernon
believes, beats the playwrights into the
ground. Or, rather, the odd habit of
managements expecting masterpieces
instead of good workable plays. “And I
know from my work with the ABC how
badly we need good workable plays,”
she said. “We have an unending search
for plays, both here and overseas. The
rate at which television uses up material
is frightening. Unless we develop a
supply of local plays in 10 years tele-
vision will be almost entirely dependent
on overseas programme repeats.”
Miss Vernon believes that a whole
generation of children has grown up
which is unused to the theatre. “We have
to get them accustomed to the theatre
as a form of social life,” she said. “They
have to be educated to it.”
However, Miss Vernon felt that once
the good work of educating children to
the theatre was done another problem
arose: What can you take young adults
to see? “Family theatre seems to have
disappeared,” she said. “After all, what
is the use of getting your children fond
of the theatre and then having nothing
except ‘Entertaining Mr Sloane’ for
them to see?”
Tea time
TPhe director of the Ceylon Tea Propa-
A ganda Bureau, Clarence Coorey, in
Australia for the first time in eight years,
is delighted with the way we are switch-
ing to higher quality blends.
A former Indian public servant (from
the time when Britain lumped Ceylon
and India together for administrative
purposes) Coorey told us he had recently
visited France to persuade those tradi-
tionally coffee-drinking people to switch
to tea. He said that tea centres, such as
those in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth
would soon open in France.
After Australia he goes to Tokyo to
try to woo the Japanese from their tra-
ditional fondness for green, unfermented
teas. He admitted that so far Japan
was drinking only 4.4 million pounds of
black tea, mostly from Ceylon, a year.
Coorey is also vice-chairman of the
US Tea Council. “Do the Americans
still make their tea with bags?” we asked.
“Indeed they do, more than ever,” he

A short life
\ gang of Brisbane turkey thieves is
making certain it has a merry
Christmas. A few days ago the gang
I feathered its nest by stealing nine turkeys,
worth about £4O, from radio announcer
Gordon Lawlor.
The gang has an ingenious method of
penetrating Brisbane’s heavily-guarded
turkey runs. One member of the gang is
believed to be either a child or an un-
I usually small person. He crawls through
'openings made by the gang in the fire-
-1 fencing.
j Once inside he burns sulphur under
Jthe turkey perches. The turkeys breathe
the fumes and fall unconscious, right
(into the hands of the gang.
I Lawlor said that he had found traces
'of sulphur in his turkey yard after this
/raid and also two years ago when thieves
/stole 30 of his best Muscovy ducks.
Detectives have given this advice to
Brisbane’s turkey owners: “Kill your
[birds early and deep-freeze them to avoid
dheft.” Either way the turkey loses.

• “I haven’t much time for books

THE FLOGGERS
80 Years Ago: December 20, 1884
YI/rites a correspondent, apropos of
the recent Yass flogging case: “It
is chiefly the Legislative Council
interest which maintains and yearns
for a further extension of the good
old flogging system in New South
Wales. These hoary remnants of the
convict days are the men who would
hang and torture. In their ears the
whistle of the lash is as sweet music,
and the creak of the gallows-trap as
the sound of a murmuring brook.
Why should these irresponsible curiosi-
ties be allowed thus to emphasise the
brutality of our unhappy national
origin, and eternally remind the world
that this colony was swaddled in
judicial murder that she was born
under the shadow of the gaol wall,
and baptised in gore? Why should
Australian citizens be flogged for
small offences, while the people of
England and America and Germany
and France, and every other civilized
State, now revolt against such punish-
ments belonging to the era of the rack,
the stake, and the scavenger’s
daughter?”
DE TOCQUEVILLE is not by us,
and our memory may be defective;
still, so far as we do recollect, one of
his impregnable positions was that the
progress of Democracy meant, in
penal legislation at least, the progress
of humanity. And with the single
exception of British Australasia, his
position is still unassailable. With us,
however, penal brutality advances
pari passu with Democracy. We pride
ourselves on our indifference to the
opinions of strangers; but affect in-
difference as we will, we cannot blind
ourselves to the fact that nations
numbering two hundred millions and
justly claiming to occupy the front
rank in civilization, have for years
been busily employed in erasing from
their statute - books the mediaeval
savageries which we are busily em-
ployed in replacing upon ours.

and get on with Christmas."


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Future of the DLP
(lthough there may still be a fight-
ing finish for one or two seats,
ee things are clear after the Senate
jection. The first is that the ALP
nder its present leadership is finished
«an effective opposition. This was
lain enough after it lost the 1961
jtneral election when everything was
jits favor but, after two more major
fectoral defeats, the current ALP can
fcrdly pretend to be more than a party
jr faithful die-hards. The second is
iat the Liberal Party has established
'self as the party of young voters in
hat is electorally one of the world’s
tangest countries and has therefore
jcured its electoral future. The third
ithat the DLP has established itself
! a permanent factor in Australian
iitics. This is clear even if it does
k win a seat: it commands almost
lilf a million votes, it has increased
; 1963 vote by 29,000, and it
aims with justification to hold a
ilance of power in the ballot box if
\t in Parliament.
But one of the main questions that
oes emerge from the elections is:
faat exactly will be the future in-
aence of the DLP? With Liberals
irnessing the young vote and in
e next general election there will be
:arly one million people voting for
£ first time—the Liberal Party will
tcome increasingly less dependent on
(e DLP preferences. For the Labor
arty, on the other hand, it will be-
jme increasingly necessary to make
fe last desperate attempt to work
ft some sort of reconciliation with the
IP if it is ever to win back its votes.
|The Labor Party has not, of course,
k faintest hope of effecting such a
'conciliation while it retains its
esent leadership and Leftist policy.
1 the talk in the world of machinery
forms, research bureaux, pamphlet
pgrammes, etc., will be wasted
icath unless there is a genuine purge
f the Leftists or pro-Communists.
finally, the clearest definition of what
'needed to reform the Labor Party
also wasted breath unless the leader
|found who can—like Hugh Gait-
>ll in England—-buck the machine,
|c faceless men, and push the required
V r ge through. By sharpening the
j-ft-Right split and clarifying the
jlicy issues involved, the DLP has
lated the situation for such an ALP
leader: it cannot create the man him-
self. Who in the Labor Party, how-
ever, has the necessary principle, cour-
age, ambition (and health) for the
task? Names ranging from Gough
Whitlam to Allan Fraser or Kim Beaz-
ley have been mentioned but these and
several others all seem unsuitable for
one reason or another. Yet without an
Australian counterpart to Gaitskell the
Labor Party is destined to stumble on
in the wilderness.
If, as seems likely, that does
happen, what then will be the purpose
of the DLP’s policies? Its reason for
existing over the past ten years has
been to reform the Labor Party and
then rejoin it. If that goal has to be
abandoned, and the Liberals do not
need its preferences, it must then
operate as a permanently independent
party. But its biggest handicap here
is its image of a Church party. This
has always been to a great extent an
unfair image, since it has spent so
much of its time and energy helping
Protestant Liberals defeat Catholic
Laborites in elections because it re-
garded Liberal policies as sounder.
Indeed a case may be made out for
the DLP as an anti-clerical party, at
least in NSW. But the fact remains
it draws most heavily on Catholic
voters and is still thought of as a
Catholic party.
If it is to become an effective in-
dependent party, perhaps replacing the
Labor Party as the opposition, it" will
have to re-examine itself and over-
come its Church party image. This
would involve not only recruiting large
numbers of non-Catholics but ex-
panding its effective policies beyond
anti-Communism and State Aid (with-
out, of course, underplaying these,
since they have been among the main
reasons for its success with non-
Catholic as well as Catholic voters).
Otherwise, like the Labor Party, it too
will remain a minority affair—and one
of marginal importance if the Liberals
can prosper without it.
Supporters of the Liberal Party,
especially in view of its recent surge
forward, may well ask so what? But
the point is the familiar one that the
country does need a sound alternative
government, and if a Leftist Labor
Party remains the only alternative, it
may possibly, in certain circumstances,
such as major economic recession or
a major Liberal Party split, find itself,
to its surprise, in power. Such a gov-
ernment, with so many of its officials
willing, if not anxious, to do some sort
of deal with Red China when the
Asian crisis deepens, would be the
worst possible thing that could happen
to Australia. To avoid such a night-
mare a strong and sound opposition,
whatever party it is, is essential.
Defence v. Territories
of the weaknesses of the Federal
Government has been its apparent
inability to co-ordinate the policies of
some of its major departments. We
have had, in the past, for example, an
External Affairs Department executing
a policy of strengthening our ties with
our Asian allies while an Immigration
Department by a heavy-handed en-
forcement of our immigration policies
has acted as if determined to alienate
these same Asian allies. It seems now
as if we may have a similar case in
New Guinea.
Under the new defence policy we
are committed to strengthening the
defences of Australian New Guinea.
But at the same time, as Alan Reid
shows in an article on another page of
this issue, the Department of Terri-
tories is now committed to a policy of
reducing the salaries of native public
servants to 45 per cent of the rates
paid to Australian public servants
working in New Guinea—which may
have as one of its results the resentful
alienation of the native elite on whom
we must to a great extent depend for
the effective defence of New Guinea
against both open attack or subversion.
There are many arguments for and
against the policy of differing salary
rates in New Guinea, but the defence
argument against it seems by itself
persuasive. Yet there seems to have
been no attempt by the defence plan-
ners and Department of Territories to
co-ordinate their policies on this basic
matter.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Mr Barnes Says No
... despite the World Bank report
CANBERRA In world forums
and on the International front the Com-
munist bloc consistently attacks Aus-
tralia for not paying sufficient regard to
the well-being of the indigenous people
of Papua and New Guinea. Ironically
the critics would be on firmer ground if
they attacked Australia for disregarding
Australia’s long-term self interests in
Papua and New Guinea. For some
reason Australian politicians, as shrewd
and artful as their political counterparts
anywhere in the world in their approach
to internal Australian problems, seem to
leave their political brains behind as soon
as they leave the mainland to deal with
long-term New Guinea.
Take the decision to reduce the salaries
of native public servants in the Territory
to some 45 per cent of the rates paid to
expatriate (Australian) public servants.
This is a departure from the policy
followed by the former Minister for
Territories, Paul Hasluck, that both
indigenous and expatriate public servants
in Papua-New Guinea should get the
same pay for the same job, with the
expatriate getting whatever was needed
to attract him to the Territories in the
shape of expatriate allowances. Hasluck
said publicly and shrewdly that he was
following this policy to avoid dividing
the Territories' public service on a racial
basis.
Now Australia has produced a policy
which must divide the Territories’ public
service on a racial basis. I find it difficult
to imagine a more stupid decision and
one which ignored the political factors—
P. HASLUCK
and Australia’s long-term interests in the
region—more completely and blindly.
Even the mission of bankers and
economists from the International Bank
which reported on the economic develop-
ment of Papua and New Guinea had the
political good sense to take for granted
that salary levels within the Papua-New
Guinea public service would not dis-
criminate between indigenes and expatri-
ates. At page 31 of the Mission's monu-
mental 432-page Report appears the
following: “Salary levels in the public
service should be set at levels in line with
living standards and costs in the Terri-
tory. For the expatriate an additional
allowance will be necessary.” By im-
plication this is a complete justification
of the Hasluck policy. The Mission in
effect was taking it for granted that no
Australian Government would be stupid
enough to embrace a policy so inevitably
designed to produce bad and unwanted
consequences for Australia.
If you forget for the purposes of this
exercise whether or not this action in
reducing the indigenes’ pay to 45 per
cent of the expatriates' is fair or unfair
to the native public servant and study
the consequences from Australia’s narrow
self-interests now and in the future, the
failure to consider the political factors
involved in the decision seems to emerge
with rather frightening clarity.
What is the best Australia can hope
for in Papua-New Guinea? The answers
to that question seem obvious. They are:
(1) To stay there as long as possible,
so as to ensure that the present Austra-
lian Administration is followed by an
experienced and trained administration
that will maintain stability in the area;
(2) When staying is no longer possible,
Australia to get out—leaving behind an
administration closely associated with and
sympathetically inclined towards Austra-
lia; (3) To produce an atmosphere in
which, if the administration which takes
over after Australia leaves has to look
outside its borders for technical, financial
or administrative assistance, its history,
training and inclination will be such that
it will look for assistance from Australia
rather than from some unfamiliar exter-
nal force with an axe to grind.
The decision to reduce the indigenous
public servant's pay vis-a-vis the imported
(Australian) public servant seems de-
signed to negate those three objectives.
The word elite is suspect at the moment.
Australia is not seeking to educate a
political and governing elite in Papua-
C. E. BARNES
New Guinea. It is trying to educate not
a class but all those among the'
indigenous community to whom it can)
bring education. ,
But, nevertheless, when Australia,
hands over the administration to the
indigenous inhabitants it cannot just hand
k over to anyone who walks in off the
street or out of the bush. It will hand
the administration over to legislators
public servants in whose training for-
just this task Australia is taking—very
properly—a justifiable pride. Unless!
Australia is prepared to disregard the)
experience of the new countries that have'
emerged in the postwar period, these
legislators and public servants must be
regarded as the future elite or com-
munity leaders of a self-governing Papua-|
New Guinea unit. It is this elite which;
will do much to form the Papua-Newi
Guinea attitude towards Australians when
the Territory is self-governing.
TAoes, then, the decision to reduce the
salaries of native public servants inj
the Territory to 45 per cent of the rates,
paid to expatriate Australian public set-'
vants working alongside do anything to
help Australia stay in Papua-New Guinea
as long as possible?
It is obvious that this decision must!
affect the outlook of native public J
servants- —-the potential governing elite,',
after Australia hands over the administra-
tion to the indigenous inhabitants. Asa
result of this decision they will have
nothing to lose, in the material sense, by
Australia's departure. Their material!
well-being will not be affected. The basis]
on which Australia is paying them lower 1
salaries is that this is the scale the Terri- 1
tory will be able to afford after Australia
has withdrawn. But under this decision
they will have a lot to gain.
As soon as Australia gets out, they
escape from the frustrating experience of I


working alongside Australians who are
paid more, not on the basis of qualifica-
tion and work done, but because they
belong to a different ethnic group. They
can exercise the power now being exer-
cised by Australians certainly without
losing anything materially. They can even
use Australia’s departure as a justification
for raising their standards nearer to those
of their former rulers.
I suggest that the decision is a stimulus
for the native public servants, the future
governing class in Papua-New Guinea, to
use their influence in persuading the in-
digenous inhabitants to hasten the de-
parture of Australia from the Territory.
Does the decision mean that, when
staying is possible, Australia is in a better
position to get out, leaving behind a
stable administration closely associated
with and sympathetically inclined towards
Australia? Again it would seem that the
answer is “no”. Australia needs stability
in the area. If, when Australia gets out, it
leaves behind an unstable administration,
other powers will undoubtedly start med-
dling in Papua-New Guinea affairs. In-
stability is an irresistible magnet to world
forces with a vested interest in unrest.
The longer Australia stays in the Terri-
tory the better trained its indigenous
legislators and public servants and the
less the likelihood of instability.
An indigenous administration that has
been generously treated during its
training period and on a basis that there
is no element of ethnic superiority in the
policy of the external administering
power is much more likely to be sym-
pathetically inclined towards Australia
than one which, as it acquires an increas-
ing degree of political sophistication,
could wind up with a sense of grievance
and resentment. The former Minister for
Territories, Mr Paul Hasluck (now Mini-
ster for External Affairs) realised the
danger involved in the situation which
now exists. In a speech to the Annual
Congress of the Public Service Associa-
tion of Papua and New Guinea on Sep-
tember 1, 1962, Hasluck said: “In facing
the task of reorganising the Public Ser-
vice to prepare the way for an indigenous
public service we proposed first a plan
for an integrated service iq which the in-
digenous and expatriate officers would be
fellow members of the same service, the
expatriate receiving his additional emolu-
ments in the form of expatriate allow-
ances. This proposal has the great merit
in the eyes of the Government of avoid-
ing what might seem to be a racial divi-
sion of the Public Service.”
Does this decision, the dangers of
which Hasluck foresaw in 1962, help to
bring about the third aim? Will it assist
in producing an atmosphere in which, if
the administration which takes over after
Australia > leaves has to look outside its
borders for technical, financial or admini-
strative assistance (as it inevitably will), its
history, training and inclination will be
such that it will look for such assistance
from Australia rather than from some un-
familiar external force with an axe to
grind? Again the answer seems to be
“no”. The Minister for Territories, Mr
Barnes, sought to justify the decision in
the House of Representatives on October
15. He said: “This (reduced) scale of pay
for indigenous public servants is designed
for the situation when the local officers
that is indigenous people of the Terri-
tory of Papua-New Guinea take over
from the present expatriates, the overseas
officers of the New Guinea Public Ser-
vice.- I think it would be completely dis-
honest of us to profess that they are
going to be able to choose the time when
they should become independent and
then saddle them with a Public Service
built on Australian standards.”
Obviously even after it gets out, Aus-
tralia is not going to leave a self-govern-
ing Papua-New Guinea to its fate like
a sheep turned out into unfenced moun-
tain country during a drought. Enlight-
ened self-interest demands otherwise. If
Australia does not act as protector and
shepherd during Papua-New Guinea’s
formative years as a self-governing com-
munity, there are plenty around the
world delighted to take on the task. Some
of them would make most uncomfortable
near-neighbors for Australia. Leaving
aside altogether the Christian doctrine
that you should help your neighbor, par-
ticularly a neighbor who has worked for
you and with you, Australia’s own self-
interests demand that Australia should
continue to assist Papua-New Guinea
during at least its early years as a self-
governing country, when it will undoubt-
edly require external assistance.
I>ut dangerously implicit in Barnes’s
statement is the suggestion that when
Australia pulls out of Papua-New Guinea
it will pull out completely. There will be
no further help. Assistance such as the
£28,496,000 it is paying out during the
current financial year to promote Papua-
New Guinea development will vanish.
The Territory must have a Public Service
which it can maintain from its internal re-
sources. This attitude cannot possibly be
right. If Papua-New Guinea as an in-
dependent unit continues to need assist-
ance, it is in Australia’s interests to en-
sure that Australia is the one that pro-
vides it. It knows that its assistance would
be disinterested as far as using Papua-
New Guinea as a springboard for opera-
tions against any other country or group
of countries was concerned. It could not
be as positive that the assistance of others
would be as similarly disinterested.
But the decision to downgrade the in-
digenous Papua - New Guinea Public
Service, carrying with it the implication
that once Australia gets out it gets out
completely, allows the Papua - New
Guinea legislator and public servant to
develop the psychology that Australia
need not necessarily be the country to
which Papua-New Guinea will turn auto-
matically and inevitably for co-operation
and assistance once it achieves self-
government.
A possible explanation for the weak-
nesses which, in my view, are starting to
emerge very clearly on Papua-New
Guinea policy is the recent reduction in

status of the Territories portfolio. In con-
versation, Minister after Minister will
agree that the Territories portfolio,
through which Papua-New Guinea policy
is expressed, is as sensitive a portfolio as
there is in the Federal Cabinet. But after
the last general elections when Hasluck,
who held Territories for years, accepted
promotion and became External Affairs
Minister, the portfolio was handed over
to a Country Party stalwart, Mr Charles
Edward (“Ced") Barnes, who had had no
previous Ministerial experience and only
limited Parliamentary experience. Ob-
viously he could not be made a member
of the inner Cabinet of 12 which makes
the major policy decisions for the Men-
zies Government. The portfolio became
a very low-ranking one.
Hasluck as Territories Minister had his
faults. He is stubborn, inclined towards
paternalism, imperious and rather in-
tolerant of viewpoints other than his own.
But, a professional historian, he had a
conception of the march of events,
subtlety of mind, and an appreciation of
the political factors involved in the issues
he was handling. While his formative
years belonged to the pre-war era —he
is 59, he had sufficient flexibility to re-
adjust his thinking to the changed world
of the post-war period. He was also a
very senior experienced Minister. Barnes,
63, a grazier, who breeds and races
thoroughbred horses, is a very nice man
who is probably a good administrator.
He makes decisions clearly and crisply.
He is long and lean, with a horseman’s
ambling gait and a drooping black mous-
tache. Hang a couple of six-guns at his
side and a ten gallon hat on his head and
he would not be out of place walking
slowly down the main street in a wild
west film as the ageing, courageous, but
slightly bewildered sheriff about to shoot
it out with the young desperado who is
terrorising the town. But even his best
friends would be hard put to describe
him as a possessor of a subtle mind.
In his speeches in Parliament, and
his attitudes, he sees things in black and
white. There are no shadings. Ministers
like this are invaluable to a Cabinet.
In my view, the portfolio, because of
its importance to Australia should never
go to a junior, inexperienced Minister
and, if possible, should have Cabinet
status. For, leaving out altogether the
fairness of the decision to the Papua-
New Guinea public servants involved, the
decision to divide the Papua-New Guinea
public service racially is so bad as to
suggest that Cabinet, the Menzies Gov-
ernment’s main policy-making body,
made the decision on a recommendation
and not on mature political reflection.

DIVORCE
The Border-Jumpers
SYDNEY NSW divorce lawyers —
as well as NSW citizens seeking divorces
are becoming increasingly concerned
with the prolonged delays in the hearings
of divorce proceedings. They claim that
the backlog of both defended and unde-
fended cases is unnecessarily great. Many
cases are on record of NSW people
living near Queensland border-jumping
to Brisbane to obtain divorces, or those
living near Victoria to Melbourne (some
litigants incensed over the delays go to
Reno and Mexico for “Hollywood” style
divorces) because their hearings will
come before the courts there much
sooner than in NSW.
At present in NSW the period between
the setting down and the actual hearing
of an undefended case is about six
j nths and a defended case seven
months at a very minimum. In some
cases the parties have been waiting for
up to three years. The total backlog in
the State is about 200 completely de-
fended suits, approximately 1400 unde-
fended, and in the “B” list (defended
only in respect of ancillary matters)
something like 50.
One question is whether a Federal
Court to be established next year will
help solve this problem. This particular
court was first referred to at the Hobart
Law Conference in January, 1963, by
the then Solicitor-General, Sir Kenneth
Bailey, who announced that the Federal
Cabinet had authorised the preparation of
plans for it. He did this after two NSW
Queen’s Counsellors, Messrs M. Byer and
P. B. Toose, had presented papers which
suggested the High Court be relieved of
its original jurisdictional functions and
the amount of appellant Work be re-
duced. They suggested that the State
Courts should also cease to have Federal
jurisdiction which would ensure the
Federal Government retained full and
direct responsibility for the administra-
tion of Commonwealth Statutes involving
the exercise of the judicial powers of the
Commonwealth. But when Sir Kenneth
made his announcement he gave no in-
dication whether the new court would
involve itself in divorce. It is under-
stood that both the Law Council of
Australia and the NSW Bar Association
supported the idea that divorce should
be included. However, the Federal
Government may not want the new court
to burden itself with such a large volume
of work which divorce would involve.
When Sir Gnrfield Barwick, QC, as
Attorney-General, introduced the Matri-
monial Causes Act 1959 he adopted the
line that the work would not be taken
from the State Courts. This could result
in opposition to divorce being included
in the jurisdictional powers of the new
SIR K. H. BAILEY
SIR. G. BARWICK
court, unless the present Attorney-
General thinks otherwise. Lawyers claim
that, should divorce be included, there is
no guarantee the backlog problem would
be solved. The only remedy for delays
in the hearing of any sort of court cases
is the appointment of judges, experts in
their own jurisdiction, and more judges
actively sitting.

HANGING
Deterrent?
ADELAIDE How pointless was
the hanging of murderer Glen Sabre
Valance in the Adelaide Gaol last
month? Senior police officers, some of
whom were known to privately oppose the
hanging, were confident that at least it
would act as a deterrent and there would
be no murders for some time; yet, within
days of the execution two women died,
one in a knife attack and the other in a
shooting. Valance, a 21-year-old station
hand, shot his former employer, David
"Oh, yes. One manages to scratch a living out of it!"
Strang, as he slept, then raped Strang’s
wife in bed besidf the dead man.
Commutation petitioners, who worked
almost non-stop to collect more than
3000 signatures in the 60 hours between
Executive Council’s decision not to inter-
vene in the death sentence and the pre-
sentation of petitions on the afternoon
before the hanging, said the murder was
a particularly brutal and shocking one.
The hanging was the first in SA since
the infamous Sundown Station murderer
Raymond John Bailey was executed in
1958. Since then, 10 death sentences
had been commuted to life imprisonment
and there did not seem to be a strong
reason for a hanging. One opinion was
that Executive Council’s decision not
to intervene was influenced by the recent
hanging of Perth multi-murderer Eric
Edgar Cooke, while others suggested that
Valance was executed because he killed
a grazier at a time when a new Country
Party threatened the Playford Govern-
ment.
Perhaps the most convincing sugges-
tion was that the Government felt it had
erred a little on the side of leniency in
recent years and was taking advantage
of a case in which public feeling was
high to warn that the death penalty could
and would be implemented to remove
murderers and deter others. Whatever
the reason, most people in SA felt it was

myth that capital punishment is a deter-
rent”, the official organ of the Methodist
Church in SA, the “Methodist”, said:
“All that the hooded hangman has proved
is that we still have a law on our books
which is neither human nor reasonable

practice?” It was a question which beg-

CRIME
“Not Nazi”
SYDNEY Judge G. F. Amsberg
said in the Quarter Sessions last week
that a man who was arrested in a raid
on the Nazi Party headquarters at Ash-
field on June 26 had been a confidence
man for a long time. The man, Julian
Ashleigh Sellors, 29, was gaoled for 15
months on two charges of false pre-
tences. Sellors denied at earlier proceed-
ings that he was a member of the Nazi
movement in Sydney.
Detective Sergeant E. E. Canacott
of the CIB told the court that Sellors
had obtained money by false pretences
after he and a man named Graeme Theo
Royce registered a business name, Osana
(Japan) Finance Co., finance consultants
of Elizabeth Street, Sydney. The two
received deposits and valuation fees on
the pretence that large loans would be
advanced. On one occasion they gave
an elaborate party at the Chevron Hotel
for many distinguished guests, where they
gave the impression they had connections
in Tokyo and Honolulu . . . and could
raise unlimited finance for the purchase
of motor vehicles and properties. They
had advertised widely and even had
Japanese characters on their printed
material.
(Royce, gaoled earlier this year, was
connected with the Nazis in Sydney.
When the nationalistic Australian Party,
launched in 1955, was abandoned, the
leader of the current National Socialist
Party Mr Arthur Charles Smith, “storm-

being in prison, was not a member.
Smith was gaoled for six months in July

CENSORSHIP
Jolley’s 12
PERTH The academic staff of the
West Australian University has been
stopped by the Customs Department
from obtaining 12 books on the banned
list. Last week the University’s librarian,
L. Jolley, announced that in the past 15
months the Customs Department had re-
fused the University permission to obtain
the novel “Another Country” by Ameri-
can Negro author James Baldwin and
had failed to reply to requests for eleven
other books which were required for
study and research.
(The Associate Professor of Clinical
Psychology at the University of NSW,
Professor R. Martin, recently requested
the University’s library to purchase eight
books valued at £7O. Two of the books
are Louis S. London’s “Abnormal Sexual
Behavior” and Richard Hauser’s “The
Homosexual Society”. In due course the
library got the books —but only after the
Customs Department released them on
the conditions that (1) the reader includ-
ing any professor—agrees to use the pub-
lications only in the supervised area and
that his reading be marked off against
his signature; and (2) that he agrees not
to reproduce the whole or any part of
the contents of the publication. See 8.,
December 5.)
Meanwhile, in Canberra Dr R. F.
Brissenden, Australian National Uni-
versity lecturer, said he had unsuccess-
fully applied to import a number of
copies of “Lolita” for use in the English
course on American literature, but he
had side-stepped the ban by reading parts
of the book to students. “The passages
I read were the author’s description of
America and the postscript in which the
author explains what he is trying to
achieve in the book,” he said.
“The book was part of the ANU’s
English syllabus and was a good illustra-
tion of a foreign author coming to
America and trying to write like an
American,” he said.
MIGRATION
“Dastardly”
BRISBANE The Premier Mr
Frank Nicklin last week attacked the
Left-wing influenced Queensland Trades
and Labor Council over its intensive pub-
licity campaign in Britain in an attempt
to stop skilled workers from migrating
to Queensland. The previous week Mr
Nicklin announced that a special mission
would leave for Europe in mid-January
on an ambitious plan to secure thousands
of skilled workers. The mission, which
is being financed by the Queensland
Government and industry, was estab-
lished following extensive investigation
by the State Migration Minister, Dr Peter

Delamothe, the Industrial Development
Minister, Mr A. Munro, and the Labor
and Industry Minister, Mr A. Dewar.
Dr Delamothe said at the time that
Queensland would need thousands of
skilled workers for already there was a
shortage of 2000 —mainly in the electrical
and metal trades. He emphasised the
labor problem by revealing that during
the year ended September 30 last, only
20 per cent of the 2281 workers who
migrated to Queensland were skilled.
However, the Trades and Labor Coun-
cil took exception to the Government’s
move and circularised a letter to all metal
and building trade unions in England
attacking low wages and the penal pro-
visions of industrial legislation in the
State. In State Parliament last week Mr
Nicklin described the council’s move as
a “dastardly plot to sabotage Queens-
land’s economy. It is the work of in-
dustrial saboteurs who seek to stab their
own State in the back.” The instigator
of the letter, he said, was being “as dan-
gerous and irresponsible as a child with
a claw hammer in one hand and a watch
in the other”, and the Government would
take adequate measures to counter-act
effectively “these cuckoos befouling the
nest of Queensland’s industrial unionism”.
Mr Nicklin told Parliament he had
received the circular sent to England in
a letter from the Queensland branch
secretary of the Operative Painters and
Decorators’ Union of Australia, Mr E. J.
Hanson. Mr Nicklin said the circular,
which was signed by Mr J. P. Vaggers,
acting secretary of the Trades and Labor
Council, contained “malignantly false
propaganda as to wages and conditions
in the State.” The Premier said Mr Han-
son was spokesman for a Communist
controlled union, but the major respon-
sibility rested with the Communist-rid-
dled Trades and Labor Council.
Part of the circular read: Dear Friends,
It was decided that correspondence be
forwarded to you advising that in spite
of the many campaigns being waged at
the present time, Queensland still is a
low-wage State, and monopoly interests
and employers, generally, the State
Government and the Industrial Commis-
sion, collaborate very closely to prevent
workers from obtaining decent wages. At
present all major factions of the trade
union movement are campaigning for
wage increases by taking industrial action
to force employers to negotiate outside
the court by way of industrial agree-
ments. “In view of the present situation,
we would be pleased if you would give
widespread publicity to the facts regard-
ing conditions in this State, so that in-
tending migrants will not be misled by
the glowing statements emanating from
Government circulars.”
Mr Nicklin said Hanson and his asso-
ciates at the Trades Hall, obviously,
were planning some gun-at-the-head-of-
the-employer tactic to force wages up.
“They feel that their industrial blackmail
will have to cease, if sufficient building
and other tradesmen are available for
jobs in Queensland.” It was true that
award wages for builders’ laborers and
building tradesmen were slightly lower
in Queensland than in some other States,
but there were other important relevant
factors that closed the gap, and brought
Queensland unionists to a level equal
with the other States, he said.
UNIONS
The Isa
BRISBANE The bitter 15-weeks-
old Mt Isa Mines’ dispute took a
dramatic turn last week when the
Queensland Parliament declared a State
of Emergency. A stern-faced Premier
Frank Nicklin made this announcement
after a special meeting of Cabinet called
to consider the critical situation at Mt
Isa. At the time of going to press the
underground workers at Mt Isa said
they would consider the Government’s
decision at a special meeting. The dis-
pute began on August 25 when miners
reverted from contract rates to wages
in protest against the refusal of the State
Industrial Commission to grant them a
£4 a week wage increase; and against
the Industrial and Conciliation section
which allows the Commission to decrease
bonus payments, but not increase them;
and against what miners describe as the
company’s refusal to take part in bona
fide conferences on the wage issue.
The State of Emergency and Order in
Council was made by the Executive

They were bringing in the harvest in a dozen different, widely spread farms
almost at the same time. Connor, Shea & Co. Pty. Ltd., Agricultural Machinery
Manufacturers, wanted to see their machinery at work. Thanks to their Cessna
they were right there at harvest time on various farms scattered throughout
Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.
Connor, Shea & Co. Pty. Ltd. say they wouldn’t he without their Cessna. Not
only does it enable the company to be in the right place at exactly the right time,
it also speeds up sales and allows them to give on-the-spot service to their
equipment. In the words of one of their directors, “In two days we accomplished
what would have normally taken a full week by motor vehicle. Furthermore, we
saved considerable time because we were able to land right on every farm we
wished to visit.”
This kind of service brings added invaluable prestige to the company and
makes yet another success story for the magnificent Cessna.
Perhaps a Cessna is just what your company needs for economy reasons and
to speed up sales and service? It costs nothing for a Cessna consultant to call
and discuss your needs.

Council under the provision of the State
Transport Acts. The Order says: Miners
shall not refuse accept contract and, or,
piecework allowed by the award; the in-
dustrial magistrate of Mount Isa is em-
powered to interpret if necessary the
award and contracts so that work is
speedily resumed; no person would be
allowed to counsel, incite, induce or pro-
cure or attempt to procure, or in any way
aid, abet or assist any person, corpora-
tion, association or union to contravene
or fail to comply with the order; any
person or body contravening the order
be guilty of an offence. (Under State of
Emergency breaches can bring penalties
of up to £lOO or six months’ gaol.)
Mr Nicklin claimed that the trouble
at Mt Isa is due mainly to an individual,
acting independently of AWU and in-
stigating miners to refuse to revert to
contract work. There is little doubt in
industrial circles that the individual is
G. F. R. NICKLIN
Pat Mackie, the Canadian-born chairman
of a recent meeting at which the miners
decided to continue on wages work.
Mackie was discharged last month by
the Mt Isa Mines management for being
absent from work without permission.
Mackie failed in an appeal to Industrial
Magistrate at Mt Isa when he claimed
he was a union officer and could take
leave from work when he had to carry
out union business. It is known that
Mackie and his followers are in favor
of breaking away from the AWU.
Last week Isa miners decided to send
delegates to the Isa Trades and Labor
Council to discuss affiliation. The AWU
so far has been unable to get miners
back to contract work, even though
AWU officials have indicated to the Full
Bench of the State Industrial Com-
mission of Brisbane that union executives
want to settle the dispute.
Meanwhile Isa miners seem prepared
to fight until they drop for what they
say are their “just claims” They are
working on wages of £24 4s. 4d. a week
compared with normal contract return
of £5O to £6O.


Beneath the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and soon beneath the
South China Sea, Australia is served by the most dependable
communications system yet devised. These coaxial submarine
cable systems are so efficient, so much in public demand,
that their considerable traffic capacity is filling rapidly. While
cables of even greater capacity are being developed, the search
for additional and more mobile communication channels is being
extended into outer space. Australia entered into an inter-
national partnership in August, 1964, to establish
and operate a global communication
satellite system, with O.T.C. as the responsible communication
entity representing Australia. It is safe to predict that the
introduction of internationally owned satellite communi-
cations systems will coincide with the continued development
and expansion of coaxial submarine cable networks, thereby
increasing Australia’s already substantial ownership in inter-
national facilities aimed at providing the highest attainable
communications service with the world at large.

Revolution in the Suburbs
Looking for people with a pound in their pockets
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Many children growing up in Aus-
tralia now will never know the
tradition of a trip to town to see
Father Christmas. You can grow senti-
mental over this if you like, remembering
Christmases past, but Father Christmas
is resilient. -He now does just as good
business as ever in the suburbs.
At no time of the year are the changes
in Australian shopping habits seen more
clearly than now. Children are one of the
reason why suburban shopping has be-
come so popular, and one of the strongest
shifts in consumer habits is in children’s
wear. But the force which led retail shops
to put up expensive buildings in the
suburbs to capture what is really only
the same percentage of consumer ex-
penditure has now almost spent itself.
The shopping revolution, if revolution it
was, is almost over.
There will be further changes and in
time some more spectacular projects. Mr
Charles Lloyd Jones or Mr Theo Kelly
will go on making speeches about traffic
problems but the city shops now know
the worst. Those which have so far
survived the competition of suburban
shops (often their own) should continue
to survive. Those which have not made
their moves vet or have made ill-advised
ti/ . .
moves will, nave few' opportunities to
retrieve their position.
Sydney should continue to get the
best of both worlds. Sydney has always
had more and keener competition from
different styles and sizes of shops than
other cities. Enough of these survive.
Sydney is likely to be the only Austra-
lian city to retain a good, lively, varied
shopping area. Melbourne is dominated
by Myers and has never given shoppers
much of the footsore thrill of comparison
shopping. The smaller cities are likely
to find suburban development outstrip-
ping urban.
In Sydney the flight to the suburbs is
almost universal. Not only the depart-
ment stores, but many of the specialty
shops—jewellers, menswear, home fur-
nishers, booksellers, fabric shops, sweet
shops—have opened a suburban branch.
Offhand, there are only people like
Richard Hunt and Hardy Bros who
haven’t made a move. And where on
earth could they go?
Who shops where?
Retail Traders’ Association seemed
to have worked out the simplest
formula on who shops where and why.
“People who know what they want shop
in the suburbs,” the secretary, Mr J. B.
Griffin, said. “Those who don't go to
the city.”
The move to the suburbs, most people
in the retail trade are quick to point out,
did not begin a few years ago. The
chain stores went to the suburbs before
World War 11, and Grace Bros, whose
suburban operations have been particu-
larly successful, could draw on 30 years’
experience in both Bondi and Parramatta
before they opened their full-scale shops
within the past eight years.
For better or worse most of the moves
have been made. Maps of the City of
Sydney and its suburbs hang in board-
rooms. Directors study them with the
intensity of a Napoleon carving up
Europe. Analyses are made of areas,
breaking down the population by age,
incomes, inclination and so on. Aerial
photographs are pieced together.
Finally a decision has to be made, a
decision in the case of Grace Bros’ Rose-
lands development, worth £5 million. The
strongest indication that most of the best
vantage points are now occupied is that
Grace Bros is building a completely new
centre at Roselands. This project, which
should be opened before next Christmas,
is somewhat larger than Myers at Chad-
stone, but not significantly so. It will
have one million square feet of floor
space, about the same as at the Grace
Bros complex of shops in Broadway, and
parking for 3000 cars, compared with
2700 at Chadstone.
Roselands is the most expensive and
comprehensive project undertaken by a
retail shop in Sydney. Grace Bros call
it a “logical step” forward from major
stores in the suburbs, but it seems un-
likely they would have taken this step if
they had been able to see an existing
shopping centre waiting for them to step
in.
The ideal area, if such a thing exists,
should have a population of at least
250,000 within five miles. Roselands,
Grace Bros believe, has 67,000 people
within walking distance, 255,000 within
10 minutes’ drive and 459,000 within
20 minutes by car.
However, at the moment Lend Lease
is building its Compass Centre at Banks-
town, with David Jones’ as the nucleus
shop, well within Grace Bros’ theoretical
five minutes’ drive. Compass won’t open
until 1966 or 1967 but the area will then
have the benefit of highly competitive


retailing on a scale not seen before in
this country. (Parramatta has several
big retailers, but Parramatta is a city
in itself.)
What made the Bankstown-St George
area so attractive to two big concerns
may enable both to survive. Developers
want people but people with a pound in
their pockets, and not a pound they are
likely to put away for a rainy day, or
spend on private schooling or on going
one better than their neighbors. Lend
Lease claim they’ll never go on the
North Shore, where snobberies are strong
and credit rating weak, in any big deve-
lopment.
Acres of fibro
new areas are not sought
after. Acres of fibro cottages may be
filled with people who need furniture and
appliances, but they are generally
weighed down by mortgages and the
expense of raising a family. Old suburbs
generally have an old population, past
their maximum earning and spending,
but these days there can be substantial
redevelopment here. A suburb like
Beverly Hills which grew up in the
early postwar years is considered good
material. There the end of mortgages
might be in sight. But a good mixed
area such as you see from the heights of
Roselands, with a satisfying vista of tele-
roofed, brick-veneer bungalows is what
developers like to gaze on.
Grace Bros are said to have not put a
foot wrong siting their suburban shops.
They themselves are a bit more modest
about it. But until now Grace Bros
alone have not only run suburban shops
successfully but have been able to rein-
vigorate their city shop through “feed-
back” from the suburbs. The Broadway
store is, according to the chairman’s re-
port in October, now showing increased
turnover and profit. This is partly due
to reorganisation of the shop itself, but
has been helped by customers coming
from the suburban shops, particularly in
search of big items, such as furniture.
There must be several factors in Grace
Bros’ success. The first, if not the most
important, is that the firm early in the
piece learnt the lessons of changing
times and changing transport routes.
Grace Bros was opened in August, 1885,
by J. N. and A. E. Grace. A. E. Grace
worked for two years in the United States
and Canada and learnt a good deal from
Marshal! Field and John Wanamaker,
both pioneers of multiple department
stores, and from Gordon Selfridge, of
London. Mr B. A. Grace, the present
chairman of directors, is a son of Mr
A. E. Grace.
By the 1920 s the shop had grown from
a single front to a large shop, sitting on
the crest of Broadway. It was sur-
rounded by affluent suburbs and most of
the main bus routes, still in private hands,
generally Sir Frederick Stewart’s, passed
the door. Grace Bros might be forgiven
for thinking that things could go on like
that for ever.
However, in 1926 the first section of
Sydney's underground railway was
opened. St James’s station gave on to
David Jones, Museum on to Mark Foys.
Wynyard and Town Hall opened up
George Street and gave access to Market
Street.
In 1930 for the first time David Jones’s
turnover exceeded that of Grace Bros.
In the same year the optimistic Grace
Bros opened a £770,000 building in King
and York Streets, for office letting. This
remained a conspicuous white elephant
until the Commonwealth Government
took it over.
Within a few years the East Hills
and Cronulla lines were opened and in
1932 the opening of the Harbor Bridge
began the development of the North
Shore. The centre of the city’s popula-
tion changed within a few years. Grace
Bros were left in the heart of what was
rapidly becoming a decaying, ageing
sector of Sydney.
The depression of the 1930 s was the
next hard lesson Grace Bros had to
" Don't go so fast, mind the Geraniums on the left, watch for the
stones, you've left out a bit under your foot ...
learn. The depression was the beginning
ot extensive credit, but Grace Bros did
not hold with these new-fangled notions
and did not accept cash orders. Mc-
Dowell's in George Street took a more
realistic view and gained a position as a
trader which it still keeps, even in its
suburban operations.
Grace Bros became a fine old family
firm, with plenty of old traditions and
old employees and not much business.
There is an anecdote about the company
which one can only hope is true. It is
of a lift-driver who retired after long
service, but grew fretful for his lift.
Eventually the firm, in the course of re-
building, pulled out some lifts, one of
which was sent, at some cost, to the
house of the ex-employee who spent his
declining years pottering around his
stationary lift.
In the ’thirties Grace Bros did make
its first sortie into the suburbs, opening
small shops in Bondi and Parramatta.
However, it was not until after the war
and after the board and management
were reorganised in the ’fifties that Grace
Bros began large-scale expansion. In the
retail trade plans can take time to come
to fruit. It took 10 years to acquire the
land at Chatswood for the shop which
opened in 1957.
One point at which luck seems to have
been on Grace Bros’ side is that their
shop was so far from the high-spending,
high-rated area of Sydney that it clearly
had no chance of again becoming what
it had once been. Grace Bros, were
spared the disappointments of the shops
which put their faith in enlivening mid-
town Sydney. This misplaced confidence
has now left Snow's and Anthony Hor-
dern's with heavy trading losses and
Mark Foy's with a reduced dividend.
Grace Bros have been able to use their
Broadway shop as a headquarters for
administration and merchandising which
shops in higher-rated areas could not
economically do.
Grace Bros’ formula has been the
multi - department shop. They expect
shoppers to want everything in the sub-
urbs, including fashion, that they can get
in town. They have not-very-profitable
departments such as haberdashery and
hardware which create traffic and satisfy
wants. But Grace Bros’ formula is not
the only one. For example, McDowell’s
and Walton’s have both done well in the
suburbs with much smaller shops. They
go to places where they fill the gaps
between the big stores an ’/hey specialise
in certain goods and services.
In spite of near-saturation in suburban
shopping no clear, simple pattern
emerges. If clear, simple patterns
emerged in retail trade some of the firms
in difficulties at the moment would be
rich.
Although suburban shopping has de-
veloped rapidly here the most spectacular


Price Controls
in Australia
When political leaders call for price
controls, most manufacturers snort with
disdain. Their prices are already con-
trolled by the most severe competition in
the country’s history.
Meanwhile, costs keep creeping up—and
the squeeze on the P&L statement gets
worse.
When the market won’t stand for higher
prices, then your only direction of relief
is downward into your own operations,
through cuts in production costs.
If welding is an important part of your
operations, that’s where Lincoln Electric
comes in.
As Australia’s largest manufacturer of arc
welding equipment, we believe it is our
job to help our customers use welding
better. That means taking full advantage
of what your existing equipment can do.
It means arranging manufacturing pro-
cesses so the welder can do his work more
smoothly and easily. It means knowing
about, and using, the latest techniques
developed here and overseas.
The man from Lincoln knows about the
squeeze on your P&L statement, and he
likes nothing better than using his know-
ledge to help you relieve the squeeze a
little. When he is in your shop he is
working not for us but for you.
Are you getting this sort of help—or only
welding supplies, as ordered? In this day
of sharp competition, when your profit
improvement may have to come mainly
out of production costs, you ought to
have both.
THE LINCOLN ELECTRIC COMPANY
SYDNEY • MELBOURNE • BRISBANE • ADELAIDE • PERTH • Nfiy ZEALAND
predictions of a decade ago, based on
American experience, have not been rea-
lised. No retailer in Australia has gone
off into the wilderness with a handful of
money, put up a full-scale development
and expected people to drive 10 miles to
it. Nor have they thought of sitting out
a decade on cheap land waiting for
housing and population to crowd in on
them.
Shopping developments have been
large and small, successful and unsuc-
cessful. They have been set down in the
heart and in the traffic mess of old sub-
urbs or have been self-contained new
buildings. What has been established is
that the small shopkeeper is still secure
and there will always be corner shops
and ribbon development as well as
planned centres.
Lie down and die
TTowever, the small trader survives on
* ability. Some of them successfully
“pick the eyes” out of the customers who
come to the department shop. Others just
lie down and die. Even so, it is hard to
see why at Chatswood, after Grace Bros
opened their shops, almost the whole
main street has been enlivened, while, at
Bondi, Grace Bros are still surrounded
by small, conservative shops.
No Australian developer can afford yet
to think in terms of the car-owner only,
although in Grace Bros’ new centre,
Roselands, in the Canterbury-St George
area, it is estimated that 70 per cent of
shoppers will use cars.. Parking is a
prime requirement, but with present
shopping habits and legal hours it is un-
economic to provide adequate parking
for crowded Saturday mornings. The
average car park would turn round four
or five times on Saturday morning.
Another point which has been shown
in Australia, and which has been Ameri-
can experience, is that the centre which
is developed by a firm which then moves
out soon loses its character and later
some of its profitability. Lend Lease,
although a development company, retains
a tight hold on its tenants. This com-
pany, which has been must successful
with its Monaro centre in Canberra, not
only decides the character and com-
position of the centre, then studies appli-
cations thoroughly, but afterwards does
not hesitate to tell individual retailers to
pull their selling socks up.
Something else which seems to have
been learnt is that the nucleus department
store should have a well-known name.
In Melbourne Myers’ may be the only
shop with sufficient drawing power to act
as a key in a major suburban centre.
Top Ryde, which was almost the first
centre opened in Sydney, was planned by
Benjamin's of Chatswood, now in re-
ceivership. It has now been taken over
by Grace Bros.

“Hay Fever” in
High Summer
Taking a stand on one-night stands
By KATHERINE RANDERSON
In February Miss Sophie Stewart and
Mr Ellis Irving will head the cast of
a production of Noel Coward's “Hay
Fever” during a two months’ tour of New
South Wales, beginning with a week at
Orange during its Festival. In deference
to their theatrical standing, they will not
travel in the Arts Council’s hot-box of a
bus but by private car. Air-conditioned
motels should make some of the journey
into the country in the hottest months
of the year almost bearable.

However, they are looking on the tour
as an -‘adventure” and find some aspects
of i, rather baffling. Why, for instance,
does Orange have'its festival in Febru-
ary? Why undertake a lengthy tour when
most country people are at the coast cool-
ino off anyway?
“Still it’s probably just as well to take
a pessimistic view in the beginning,” Mr
Irvin" said “Then we will see the diffi-
cultie°s ahead of time.” And, besides, the
tour as originally planned was for four
months, all one-night stands. After con-
templating that prospect for a time, any
other arrangement would seem reason-
a^je
Miss Stewart and Mr Irving are trying
to be rather firm about one-night stands,
simply because they believe that it is
difficult for actors to give of their best
when they are appearing in a different
theatre or hall each night, and when they
probably have to spend the minutes be-
fore going on stage packing up their
belongings to move on after the show.
They also cannot see why the experience
of touring Britain, when the minimum
run was a week and when it was accepted
that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
you did no business but by some cumu-
Native magic you make up your losses
at the end of the week, will not work
f ... , , ,
here. They think that some faith should
be put m this idea, ,f only in country
! owns - s^ h as a . and I . A ' b t whlch
built splendid civic theatres.
Beyond that, they are delighted to be
appearing in “Hay Fever”, which they
regard as an ideal entertainment play,
although a demanding one for actors.
“I hope we can give the country a first-
class production,” Miss Stewart said,
“Comedy is so much harder than tragedy,
So few people realise that. And I have
an idea that Australian actors are not
always good at comedy, although Aus-
tralians have a good sense of humor, of
a particular kind.”
In a sense, Miss Stewart and Mr
Irving, who are husband and wife, feel
that their future hangs on the tour. If
it is not a success, or, rather, if they can-
not prove to themselves that this sort of
tour can be a success, they may return to
London.
They came to Australia three years ago
with the intention of living here if things
worked out. They bought a house at
Bayview and for much of the time live
there quietly. However, they are both
too lively and devoted to the stage to
contemplate a quiet retirement with much
enthusiasm. Miss Stewart came here first
with Robert Morley in 1949 and returned
with “Dear Charles” and “Not in the
Book”. Mr Irving was born in Australia
but 30 years in London have established
him essentially as an English actor.
Since they came back with permanency
in mind they have appeared in “Write Me
a Murder” and with notable distinction in
“The Cherry Orchard” and “The Import-
ance of Being Earnest” at the Old Tote.
However, such appearances seem few and
far between to actors who for 30 years
have worked continuously either on the
London or Broadway stage or in films in
Hollywood and England, and whose last
experience in Coward plays was benefit
performances in wartime Hollywood with
Coward as producer and such players as
Ronald Colman, Dame May Whitty and
C. Aubrey Smith.
And while the modest salaries received
from the Old Tote for its initial produc-
tion, “The Cherry Orchard”, showed a
generous attitude, why should Mr Irving
and Miss Stewart, while they are living
in what is to them manifestly a wealthy
country, be expected to go on making
gestures for the Australian theatre?
They have become established here as
a husband-and-wife team in a way in
which they never were in London. Man-
agements seem to wait until they have a
play in which both can appear, although
Mr Irving recently was playing at Frank
Strain’s Bull ’n’ Bush without Miss Stew-
art. In fact, they might be developing
into our very own junior Dame Sybil and
Sir Lewis. Whether they care to see
themselves on stage as a sort of marital
monument or not, they have given the
theatre a touch of glamor at a time when
it has been looking particularly moth-
eaten.
Mr Irving began in Australia with
J. C. Williamson, and had to point out
to The Bulletin in those days that Sir
Henry Irving had adopted the name
Irving but it was Mr Irving's own. After
a tour of Canada and America he ap-
peared in “Marigold”, during the run of
which he met and married the leading
lady, Miss Stewart.
Since then they have appeared on
stage in numerous British light comedies
and drawing-room plays (and are aware
that today these plays are not fashionable
or profitable anywhere). But they have

also appeared on stage in Shakespeare
atid classic plays with most of the illus-
trious knights and dames.
Miss Stewart’s first film was “Maria
of the Red Barn”, with Eric Portman,
who was also appearing in his first film.
She also was in Czinner’s “As You Like
It”, playing Celia to Elisabeth Bergner's
Rosalind.
Mr Irving was in Hollywood in the
swashbuckling era, the late ’thirties and
early ’forties. “In those days I once
made eight films in 18 months,” he said.
“They were the really lavish days in
Hollywood. I remember for ‘The Sea
Hawk’ with Errol Flynn the whole War-
ner Brothers’ studio was flooded with
15 feet of water. A full-scale Spanish
galleon and an English frigate were built
and the 400 or 500 extras playing the
crew used to have to go aboard each
day along ramps over the water. And
there were seven cameras at work the
whole time. Nobody ever went on loca-
tion in those days just to save money.
The only time we went on location with
‘The Sea Hawk’ was to film scenes at
Malibu beach of the crews coming
ashore.”
The war ended Hollywood film careers
for both Miss Stewart and Mr Irving.
“Those were the days when people like
C. Aubrey Smith were getting white
feathers through the post,” Mr Irving
said. “We went back to England as soon
as we could. After the war it probably
would have been too difficult to begin
again in Hollywood. You have to have
some continuity there, not like in England
where if people know your reputation
and what you have done you can always
begin again.”
Neither Miss Stewart nor Mr Irving
have elaborate theories about what is
wrong with Australian theatre. They are
actors and have no wish to go into the
production or business side of it. But
they do think they can put their finger
on two things, a lack of flexibility and a
lack of follow through.
“Nothing seems to build up to any-
thing,” Mr Irving said. “The theatre is
a business like anything else. You have
to display your wares for a while before
people will come and buy. Here once a
production finishes there seems to be a
complete blank. It’s hard to understand
why good productions cannot tour the
country —that’s where your audiences are
-—as they did a couple of generations
ago. And it’s hard to understand why
good players cannot move between the
cities so that audiences can see the best
people available in parts.
“Another thing,” Miss Stewart sug-
gested, “is that producers here think of
their plays first and then decide who to
put in them. They sit around and say
‘Let's do So-and-so’, ‘Yes, let's’ and then
they think of who might play the parts.
If they considered the players available
and then thought of the best plays to
show off their talent they might get much
better results.”
Taking to the Boats
By CHARLES SRIBER
«n° many people are taking up sail-
ing the idea often frightens me.
I get people in here who have
bought sailing craft and obviously know
absolutely nothing about handling them.”
The speaker was the manager of a
marine and sailmaking concern who told
me business was booming, and that his
firm had spread activities throughout
Australia and overseas —with a big sail
loft operating in Hong Kong and rep-
resentation in the United States and
Europe.
While happy that business was so
buoyant, he reflected the concern that
many active sailors have—and most of
the men in the boat business these days
do plenty of active yachting about
handling anything as touchy as a yacht.
Yet all evidence shows that Australians
are taking to sail with an enthusiasm they
once reserved for their new model car.
When the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron
opened its 1964 season 500 sailing craft
participated in racing events with hun-
dreds more crowding the harbor. All


clubs report membership up with one
registering an increase of 150 per cent
on last season. Yacht racing goes on
summer and winter with more than 12
registered classes taking part.
What has brought about this interest
in one of the oldest forms of marine
locomotion in an age when high-powered
speed seems to be the norm? People in
the business say that while the annual
Sydney-Hobart yacht race helped capture
popular imagination, the challenge for
the America’s Cup in which Gretel did
so spectacularly well, clinched it. Aus-
tralians had shown they could sail with
the best! More and more people decided
to give it a go. The buoyant economic
situation did a lot to help. With a good
boat costing no more than a good car,
sailing came within the reach of more
people.
The competitive spirit has brought
most sailing men into racing activity
with more than a dozen classes fighting
out “round-the-buoy” or ocean battles
every weekend. These classes range from
tiny Moths and Herons which can be
sailed in highest racing form for under
£lOO to hefty ocean racers. One of the
most recently launched of these cost its
owner more than £30,000.
Whether the yacht is small or large,
upkeep is not going to be cheap. If
synthetic sails have taken the replace-
ment factor out of that part of the equip-
ment, blocks, runners, sheets and other
gear constantly need replacement. Busi-
ness is booming at the boat chandlers
and more and more are specialising in
sail.
Wharfinger Robert Campbell is on
record as the first man to own and sail
a yacht in Australia. His was a three-
ton open boat with gunter rig, built pre-
sumably near his famous wharf on the
western side of Sydney Cove, in 1827.
The sport received a fillip from the
officers and men of HMS Rainbow who,
in April of the same year, staged a
regatta and competed with the crew of
HMS Success for a purse of 50 Spanish
dollars.
T>ut the honor of holding the first Aus-
tralian regatta went to Hobart Town
where naval officers anchored in the Der-
went held a sailing race on January 5 of
that year bringing some cheer to the early
Van Diemen’s Land settlers. At that time
yachting was in its infancy even in
Britain. The Royal Yacht Squadron
staged its first regatta off Cowes in 1815.
Anniversary Day, 1837, was cele-
brated by the colonists of New South
Wales with a regatta on the harbor
the first of what was to become an annual
event. Local enthusiasm was not marked.
The populace of Sydney went on record
hoping there would be “not so much
drunkenness and riot as we have been in
the habit of seeing”.
In 1839 17 yachts competed in the
regatta, and three years later the colonists
lined the shores to gaze at a topsail
schooner, flying the burgee of the Royal
Yacht Squadron, which sailed through
the Heads under the command of 46-
year-old London stockbroker Benjamin
Boyd. But his brave arrival ended in
disaster after the collapse of his Two-
fold Bay whaling venture.
The Sydney Yacht Club was first
formed in 1856 although organised
handicapping had gone on since 1847.
A precursor of the famed 18 footers
was James Milson’s Presto, a centre-
board vessel which flew a maze of sails
totalling 2800 square feet and carried a
crew of 15!
Ocean racing began as an anniversary
regatta event in 1861, but today’s
amateurs would throw up their hands at
the monetary prizes offered. On a race
round a flagship moored one mile off
Botany Bay, 17 yachts vied for a first
place that offered a purse of £3OO. J. S.
Rountree’s Annie Ogle won.
Perhaps the most significant thing to
come out of those early races was the
daring design by Dick Harnett. Where
most boats had straight 'stems and sturdy,
long, straight keels, he designed a hull
after studying the contours of the
mackerel. His 30ft Australian had a
completely elliptical keel—a design that
could have been a prototype for most of
today’s racing craft.
Before World War 11, only the wealthy
few could afford to own and sail yachts,
and ocean racing was limited to a few
comparatively short runs. A break came
in 1944. The tide of the war had turned
and a half a dozen Sydney yachtsmen—■
all members of the Naval Auxiliary
Patrol were spending the long Labor
Day weekend at Broken Bay. They’d
made it an impromptu race—ten bob in
and winner take all.
Resting at anchor in The Basin they
decided to form a club. When hostilities
ceased the next year the Cruising Yacht
Club was born.
In Sydney, on loan from the Royal
Navy, was British yachtsman Com-
mander John Illingworth. After a talk
at the new club on ocean racing in
Britain and the activities of the Royal
Ocean Racing Club, two members
suggested a cruise to Hobart that Christ-
mas. “Why not make it a race?” Illing-
worth asked.
Seven boats lined up for the start with
Commander Illingworth skippering a 35ft
sloop Rani, specially bought for the race.
The fleet ran into bad weather. Many
hove to in the fierce gale-force winds
that lashed them off Bass Strait. Rani
sailed through and arrived in the Der-
went 17 hours ahead of the nearest com-
petitor.
JjVER since, the Hobart has been an
annual event capturing the imagina-
tion of thousands who never venture out-
side the harbor and very seldom on it.
This year some 40 yachts will start out
on the 630-mile ordeal. They may en-
counter any kind of weather, from in-
furiating calms to wild, gale-force head
winds. Last year the fleet was battered
off Storm Bay by a southerly gale with
winds reaching 70 miles an hour.
Over the years yachts have been dis-
masted, gear has broken and hulls have
been buffeted by mountainous seas, but
it is a proof of the sea-worthiness of
these small craft that no boat has
ever been lost and no yachtsman has
ever suffered serious injury. Those who
man these boats expect no comfort and
they certainly enjoy none. The race
is usually a tough, physical trial of sleep-
less nights, wet gear and food that would
make a windjammer man contemplate
mutiny. But something drives men and
young boys (a boy of 16 was among the
crews last year) to endure five or six
days of hard living for a trophy that is
valueless, or just the right to boast that
they have sailed in the Hobart race.
Not all sailing activity is so spec-
tacular. Weekly harbor events in all
States bring small craft on to the waters.
Several big-ship men have swopped a
berth on an ocean vessel for a small, 12ft
dinghy in which racing is a matter of
light touch, tactics and outfoxing one’s
opponent in shifting winds and breezes.
The racing yachts of today would
astonish an old “windbag” sailor. Work-
ing on the aeleron principle, sail areas
have diminished. Tight-hauled jibs and
mains make it possible to claw up into
the wind as no windjammer ever could.
Nor is it all competitive. Hundreds
own boats of various, and sometimes
dubious, designs in which they cruise
with the family. These cruises may vary
from a 25-mile trip to Broken Bay or
a jaunt to Kangaroo Island in the
Spencer Gulf to a long ocean voyage to
such places as Tahiti or even across the
Pacific to the US.
Modern synthetic fibre sails have done
a great deal to improve sailing per-


formance. Dacron or terylene don’t rot
when wet, can be hauled tighter than
canvas or cotton which often bags in
wind, and all outlast the old types of sail.
Sailmaking techniques have also changed.
The old sailmakers allowed for their
cotton sails to stretch. Today’s sail-
makers build their sail designs to stay as
planned. Lightweight nylon spinnakers
have transformed running before the
wind. The huge multi-colored, balloon-
like sails, known to the yachtsman as
“kites”, have a tough pulling power un-
known in the older cotton jobs.
Of course, all sailing is not done for
the love of the game. There is a marked
difference between yachting and sailing
and the results of these differing
categories of races are listed under
separate heads in the newspapers.
Sailing clubs comprise the 18 footers,
the “sixteens” and more recently the 14
footers. When these boats, frequently
bearing some “tie-up” names such as
“Friend -’o - Millers”, “Craven -A” or
“Ampol”, race their progress is followed
by ferries crowded with people who are
not primarily concerned with the fine
show the boys in the boats are putting
on. Bets are placed on the ferries and
with interested parties on various fore-
shore points around Sydney Harbor.
Police raids have sometimes led to frantic
leaps into the harbor by gentlemen who
presumably have something they would
rather the authorities knew little about.
But the fact that bets are placed and
that the winners receive monetary awards
cannot detract from the magnificent sea-
manship these crews display. Many of
the successful skippers are into their
fifties, yet they handle these light shells
with a maze of sails to bring them up
to speeds recorded as more than 24
miles an hour.
If anyone fears that we are becoming
too mechanically minded and in danger
of developing large posteriors from over-
much addiction to car riding, they should
look at any of the harbors of Australia
on the weekend.
There they will find thousands of
people whose sailing activities are an im-
pressive answer to the suggestion that
we are becoming effete or too concerned
with spectator sports.
The Marriage of Sound
By HUGH CURNOW
John Gary, the Man Who Has Almost
Everything, was, as he put it, on
cloud nine. “My manager, Joe Csida,
has just phoned from the States to tell
me that I have been placed Number
Three on the ‘Cash'oox’ poll of male
vocalists for 1964,” he said. “And, what’s
more, my Christmas album has become
the top-selling Christmas album in the
USA. For years now Elvis Presley has
out-sold everyone else with his Christmas
album. This year it's me! How about
that?” He looked as happy as a man can
be.
The first frown came when he confided
that apparently not enough Australians
had yet heard of John Gary. “Of course,
I’ve only been recording since the Octo-
ber before last but I have cut seven
albums in that time. Three have been
released in Australia by RCA but they
don’t seem to go in for the same pub-
licity campaigns in Australia as they do
back home. I really wouldn't be at all
that surprised if you introduced me here
and someone said, ‘Well, who’s he?’ Yet
when my last album was released in
America it sold 10,000 copies in San
Francisco alone on the first day ... I
guess this really is another country.
It's confusing. Everything looks Ameri-
can. It’s taken me a little time to realise
that it's not the same at all.”
John Gary, good-looking, boyish, 30,
who is singing at the Chevron, wasn’t
worried about Australia, however. If it
hadn't heard about him yet, it soon
would.
We talked of the “Almost Everything”
side of his less public life. “I have a six-
year-old son whom I don’t see much now.
My wife divorced me after seven years
because she got sick of my career taking
me away from her so much. We’re still
friends and I can visit my boy whenever
I want to but ...” his soft speaking
voice halted. “It's a tremendous thing in
your life, getting divorced. I'm waiting
on the final decree now. Then I plan to
marry a girl I’ve met since. I bought
her a diamond ring here the other day.
It was quite an experience. The jeweller
handed me an eye-piece to examine the
diamond and I spotted a few tiny flaws.
Then I asked him to lend me his eye-
piece. It was much stronger. I could see
a lot more tiny flaws with it. I told him so
and pointed out the difference in magni-
fication between the two eye-pieces. He
said ‘You’ve got very good eyes.’ I said
I couldn’t help that. I also said I couldn’t
pay what he was asking for the diamond
now that I had had a really good look
at it. Do you know he reduced the price
at least three times before I agreed to buy
it? A reputable jewellery store, too.”
Answering questions about his pre-
October ’63 life, John Gary did not
proffer information about his underwater
endurance tests for the US Navy and Air
Force, for which he still holds the world
records. Nor did he reveal that he is
currently America’s 12th best archer, as
well as being one of the 45 directors of
the Thomas A. Dooley Foundation, Inc.,
which sponsors free medical care in
South-East Asia. “The underwater tests
were frightening,” he said. “I was 41.01
hours under salt water and 78.45 hours
under fresh water. During the fresh water
endurance test I vomited six times. But
when they sent a doctor down to take a
blood sample from me underwater I
nearly died laughing. Do you know, that
doctor came swimming down with a
hypodermic needle and a sopping piece
of cotton wool to wipe it with!”
He said that archery is more popular
than golf in America and said he is cam-
paigning to have bow-and-arrow contests
included in the next Olympics. “At least
it would be more logical than those bob-
sledding contests they already have.”
"Oorn in New Orleans, where he at-
** tended an all-white co-educational
school until he was nine, John Gary to-
day dismisses anti-Negro segregationists
as “idiots”. The winner, when he was 10,
of a music scholarship to the Cathedral
School of St John the Divine, in Man-
hattan, he remem.bers wearing high white
collars “like a refugee from Eton” and
singing in the choir “like Lily Pons”.
Taken on tour, after his parents separa-
ted, by the blind pianist, Frank Pursley,
he recalls America as a series of endless
towns, “a non-stop bandstand that ended
only when my voice broke in the middle
of ‘When Irish Eyes Are Smiling’ and I
burst into tears on stage. I was just 15, so
I went back to school and then joined
the marines for three years.”
Gary’s voice has a range of three
octaves. Long periods underwater have
given him extraordinary breath control.
He likes to sing long passages without
taking a breath at all. “It suits ballads.
They’ll always be my specialty,” he said.
“I hate gimmicky, contrived singing The
thing I like about Doris Day’s voice is
that it does sound just like that even
when she’s singing around the house.
What I am aiming at is really just pure
sound.”
One way he is trying to achieve this is
by recording himself singing a song some
months before he is scheduled to do it
for RCA. “I then spend a lot of time
listening to a recording of only the musi-
cal backing to the song, while the ar-
ranger studies my solo voice rendition.
The idea is to see how completely my
voice and the music can blend so that
neither intrudes on the other. My idea
of singing is that it should be a happy
marriage with music, using lyrics to make
it all mean something. I think it’s wrong
to let yourself intrude, don’t you?”

Architects have earned our gratitude
** by improving houses in all sorts of
ways. To give a small example, they
took the old-fashioned backyard and
turned it into the outdoor living area.
One feels interesting and contemp with
an outdoor living area; whereas a back-
yard was only a place to put old boxes
and play French cricket. A man has
said that he travelled the whole world
over and found happiness in his own out-
door living area. And I can believe it.
Another excellent idea of architects
was to reform the kitchen and make it
the food preparation area. The name
takes away the squalor we associate with
the kitchen-sink drama. Even Hell’s
Kitchen might have been a more attrac-
tive residential district if it had been
known as Hell’s Food Preparation Area.
I shall not dwell on their other well-
known achievements, such as inventing
the rumpus room, and transforming the
draughty passage into a breezeway. The
particular service for which I wish to
praise architects is the way they have
glorified the garage. As one authority
put it recently: “A new importance is
being placed on the garage by home de-
signers—even for families without cars.
The garage may now be the focal point
around which the rest of the house is
planned.”
This new approach recognises the
central position of the motor car in our
lives. The time is past when a man
would build his house first and add a
garage. Now, and rightly, he builds his
garage first and adds a house (when he
can afford it). The architects, as one
would expect, have supplied an attrac-
tive name for this annexe to the garage
where members of the family are accom-
modated. It is called the living wing.
In an attempt to find what this new
conception of home design has done for
ordinary people, I interviewed a young
Sydney couple, the Subwells, who have
just started building.
Mrs Subwell told me: “Les and I have
always dreamed of having a garage of
our own. We can hardly believe it’s
coming true.”
“Have you got a car?” I asked.
She blushed charmingly. “Not yet.
You see, we’ve been married only a few
months,” she said. “But we expect to
have one by next March.”
Her husband added: “We’re building a
two-car garage for a start. We want to
have as many as we can.”
Mrs Subwell talked enthusiastically
about her plans for decorating the
garage. She had obtained some ideas
from a magazine called Garage Beauti-
ful. “We're going to have indoor climb-
ing plants, and terrazzo tiles and con-
cealed lighting,” she told me. “And we
hope to put in one of the new trans-
lucent plastic roof domes. We want to
give our car the best home we possibly
can.”
“Where will you live yourselves?” I
asked.
They said they would live in the garage
for the time being. “It’ll be quite com-
fortable,” Mrs Subwell said, “and handy
when we have to get up to the car at
night. To put a blanket on the radiator
and so on, I mean.”
“For our outdoor life, of course, we’ll
have the outdoor living area,” said her
husband. “Some time later, perhaps,
we’ll add a living wing to the garage.
I daresay we’ll need it if we can afford
to have a child. But that won’t be for
a good while yet.”
I felt heartened by the confidence
with which these newlyweds were plan-
ning their future. Mrs Subwell seemed
the picture of a happy young garage-
wife.
To get a broader understanding of the
new trend I called on a leading architect,
Hugo Persent of Persent and Associates.
“Traditional Australian domestic archi-
tecture is pitifully backward,” he told
me. “Rows of cottages with lounge-
rooms and bedrooms, but often no
proper garage or carport. There are even
houses without any off-street parking.
“Well, we are changing all that.
Briefly, we aim to provide modern
accommodation for cars and adequate
off-street parking for human beings.
Have a look at this.”
Mr Persent showed me drawings of an
eight-floor block of garage-flats to be
built for Ultra Developers Ltd.
“Here you have different types of
garage for one-car, two-car and no-car
families,” he said. “The no-car family
can use the garage as an indoor living
and rumpus area. And the ground floor
will incorporate four service stations
selling different brands of petrol.”
As I left his office I could not help
murmuring with satisfaction: “The
stately garages of Sydney, how beautiful
they stand.”
I am looking forward to the Subwells’
garage-warming party.

Vietnam’s Political

Young monks with gasoline cans
By DENIS WARNER
Thich Tri Quang, the Venerable Bril-
liant Mind who leads the militant
Buddhist movement in South Viet-
nam, is no longer readily accessible to
foreigners, especially newspapermen. But
early in August, 1963, when I climbed
the steps of the Xa Loi Pagoda with a
Buddhist layman friend, Tri Quang
wanted publicity in the US Press, and
he made us welcome.
I have rarely met a man so sure of
himself. In his drab, grey robes, he ably
dominated the strange scene, with its
background of barbed wire and wooden
barricades and the murmur of prayer that
drifted on the incense-laden breeze from
the pagoda proper. Inside, several thous-
and Buddhists, mostly women and young
girls, knelt before the enshrined heart
of Thich Quang Due, the first bonze to
burn himself to death in protest against
the government of President Ngo Dinh
Diem. A young monk hurried past us
with a gasoline can. presumably for one
of the three new human sacrifices Tri
Quang said were in preparation.
Tri Quang did not pretend that the
Buddhist religious campaign was without
political motivations. His plan, it ap-
peared, was to continue forcing the gov-
ernment into rash acts against the Bud-
dhists. Each new act of violence brought
new inflammatory protests from the pago-
das and new incitements to Diem and his
brother and sister-in-law, the Ngo Dinh
Nhus, to try to end the Buddhist prob-
lem once and for all by force. When I
told him that the Special Forces of the
army had been alerted to attack the
pagoda, he smiled and answered: “Don’t
you think it will help our cause if some
of us are killed?”
Tri Quang's request for asylum in the
American embassy after the attack on the
Xa Loi Pagoda a few days later was a
stratagem typical of the man. It was
designed to widen the gap between the
Americans and the Diem regime, and it
succeeded. It did not, however, throw
much light on Tri Quang's political in-
clinations and intentions. The Americans
who questioned him found no evidence
that he was a Communist, or even a
neutralist. But even if one gives Tri
Quang the benefit of the doubt as far
as links with the Vietcong are concerned,
and assumes that his objectives go no
farther than the establishment of basic
Buddhist political supremacy, there re-
main many reasons for concern. As some
Buddhist laymen see it, the activities of
his political organisation are less Buddhist
than Triad, a powerful secret society
founded in China in the 18th century
that later held sway over millions of
Chinese in South-East Asia. These Bud-
dhists fear that Tri Quang’s militant
movement will be a vehicle by which
South Vietnam may be delivered politi-
cally into the hands of the Vietcong.
The idea may be much less far-fetched
than it seems. The Triad (Heaven and
Earth) Society controlled Singapore, tried
to take over Bangkok, and spread through
Vietnam from Ha Tien Province which
was leased to the society. Its member-
ship once included tens of thousands of
Vietnamese, including Ho Chi-minh's
father. And in a country where secret-
society membership is traditionally more
binding than political ties and where
reliance on astrology enters even the
councils of state, the Triad became a
pattern for Vietnam's furtive, complex,
fragmented social structure, so bewilder-
ing to westerners and confusing even to
the Vietnamese.
Although Diem outlawed the secret
societies, the national tradition is made to
order for unscrupulous religious manipu-
lation. Sometimes when Ngo Dinh Nhu
said that South Vietnam suffered from
three disabilities, and placed discord and
under-development ahead of the Viet-
cong, westerners felt that he was lacking
in appreciation of the gravity of the
Communist threat. But the real lack
was western understanding of the clandes-
tine nature of Vietnam’s political and
religious organisation.
Perhaps the closest Vietnamese equiva-
lent to an orthodox western political
organisation is the Dai Viet Party. But
until it began active recruiting early this
year, its membership never exceeded a
thousand. Many of its original members
were also members of the Triad Society,
from which the party borrowed
much of the ritual for its secret initiation
ceremony. Masked officials swore in new
members at pistol point. One branch of
the party, the Dai Viet Quoc Xa, in
direct imitation of the killer groups of the
Triad, specialised in murder and assas-
sination. Intimidation, blackmail and ex-
tortion were standard means of raising
funds.
The other parties have similar back-
grounds in clandestine organisation. The
Vietnamese Kuomintang Party was a
direct offshoot of the Chinese Kuomin-
tang, on which it drew heavily for sup-
port. In 1930 the French guillotined
twelve of its leaders, an example that
only helped to proliferate the number
of bands, euphemistically referred to as
Maquis, which have always roamed the
mountains or lived under local warlords.
Despite its past and its connections, it
still ranks next to the Dai Viet on the
political lists. The Binh Xuyen, under the
rule of France and Bao Dai, used to run
organised vice and the police of
Saigon on a strictly secret-society basis.
The Hoa Hao in the southern Mekong
Delta is a Buddhist offshoot with spiritual
and temporal interest and, at times, sub-
stantial armed forces of its own. The
Cao Dai is a mixture of Buddhists, Tao-
ists, Confucians, spiritualists, and Christ-
ians joined with Triad Society elements.
Even the Vietcong has always depended
heavily on organisational secrecy. In its
formative stages, the peasants accepted
the Vietcong as they accepted the secret
societies, the sects, and the political
Maquis.
Nhu's creation of the Can Lao Party
as the secret apparatus of his brother
Diem's government fitted into the familiar
pattern. Without the protection and pat-
ronage the Can Lao provided, the re-
gime could not have survived. Nhu pro-
bably signed his own death warrant early
in 1963 when he dismissed the Can
Lao’s brilliant director, Dr Tran Kim
Tuyen. From this disintegration at the
centre came the blunders and miscalcu-
lations that led first to the suppression of
the Buddhists in the May, 1963, riots in
Hue and finally to the November coup.
Diem, of course, was torn between
American advice to be a compassionate
ruler and the demands of Nhu and his
wife to crush the Buddhists, as he had
smashed the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai
sects and the Binh Xuyen gangsters in
1955. The result was that he failed to
give any real leadership. Diem's weakness
was fully exploited by the Buddhists
under the direction of Tri Quang, who
stirred up the crowds in Hue, engineered

the sacrifices of the bonzes, and provoked
the Diem regime into a succession of
errors.
Even when I interviewed Tri Quang in
1963, there were stories that he had
Communist sympathies. He denied them.
“The organisation of the Vietnamese
armed forces answers whether we fight
Communism,” he said. “Seventy per cent
of the armed forces are Buddhists. There
is no Communist infiltration in our ranks.
We don’t want to be exploited. We
know that Communists, not only in Viet-
nam, but all over the world, are oppor-
tunists. They are kind in word, but not in
deeds.”
Where Tri Quang is King
11/Jy notes of the interview record the
subsequent comment by my lay
Buddhist friend that Tri Quang was
“more or less neutralist”. The description
reflected the generally sketchy informa-
tion then available about Tri Quang. He
was born on November 24, 1922, in
Quang Binh Province in North Vietnam
and attended the Higher Buddhist School
in Hue. The French also viewed Tri
Quang with suspicion. They arrested him
in 1950 on charges of having collabor-
ated with the Vietminh but soon let him
go. In 1954 he came south with the
flow of refugees from North Vietnam,
most of whom were Catholics. Although
he was under constant suspicion of
working with the Vietcong, no proof was
ever advanced and he was never arrested
by Diem. In any case, it was his militant
Buddhism, publicly and forcibly ex-
pressed, which soon after he settled in
Hue won him the presidency of the
Buddhist Association and gave him the
base for his rise.
Wjth the younger monks who were
with him in the Buddhist revolt last year,
Tri Quang has set out to strengthen the
organisation of Buddhism in Vietnam and
to give it a militant political orientation
that among the youth and in central
Vietnam, where Tri Quang's influence is
decisive, seems destined to play into the
hands of the Vietcong. He has openly
used Buddhism in central Vietnam to
foster the Peoples’ Revolutionary Force,
a political movement with organisational
overtones of the Triad.
While its leaders publicly protest that
the Force is anti-Communist and anti-
neutralist, the nine provincial committees
in the movement have embarked on a
campaign of character assassination and,
when it suits their purpose, of lawlessness,
violence, and intimidation reminiscent of
the secret societies.
Tri Quang's following in the Hue reg-
ion crosses the lines between the govern-
ment and Vietcong-controlled areas. His
Buddhist Youth Movement there has a
membership of tens of thousands. "In
central Vietnam,” a moderate Buddhist

layman told me, “Tri Quang is king.”
Given the complaisant attitude of the
Vietcong to Tri Quang’s leadership in
the district, this is not an overstatement.
In the name of defending Buddhism,
Tri Quang’s youth groups are ready to
protest against any injustice to those
who claim to be co-religionists. This
“protection” extends even to arrested
Vietcong suspects who are also Buddhists.
To appoint his own men as chaplains in
the army is another of Tri Quang’s lesser
ambitions. Since July, about seventy Bud-
dhist chaplains have been with the gov-
ernment forces. A later development has
been the creation of Buddhist committees
in the army, and at least part of the col-
lapse in morale now gravely affecting the
fighting capacity of six of the twenty-
eight regiments is attributed to their
activities.
The secret Government
HThe main targets for the Force are
not neutralists and Communists, since
some of their committees are known to
include both, but former members of the
Can Lao Party, Ngo Dinh Nhu’s secret
government within the government. A
catchall attack on the Can Lao could in-
clude every official left over from the
Diem regime, or anyone the Force op-
poses. Its immediate objective is the disso-
lution of all political parties and an early
general election.
The titular leader of the Force is Dr
Le Khac Quyen, dean of the faculty of
medicine at Hue University. On the criti-
cal night of May 8, 1963, Dr Quyen was
at Hue hospital when the bodies of the
Buddhists killed in the riots were brought
in. From that moment Dr Quyen threw in
his lot with Tri Quang and led the
student agitation in Hue, for which he
was imprisoned by Diem.
“We have a purpose, a high purpose,”
Quyen told me in a recent interview. “It
is not that we want our members elected
■ —we are not a party. We will tell our
members to elect good candidates and
then make sure that there are good candi-
dates.”
This is to be done very simply. Quyen
said he has a complete list of all Can Lao
members and that he intends to use this
list to “survey and control” all candidates.
After the election the Force will be dis-
solved, and if Quyen and Tri Quang’s
formula is accepted, the newly elected
members of the National Assembly will
form new parties from their ranks. The
leading party, Tri Quang and Quyen are
resolved, will bear the imprint of the
Force. Speculating about the future, Dr
Quyen said it might become necessary
“to tell the Americans to go home and to
continue the fight against Communism.”
He has also hinted at a separatist move-
ment in central Vietnam.
Many of the older Buddhists disap-


prove bitterly of what is now happening.
They are incensed that university stu-
dents, and even schoolchildren, have
abandoned their studies to become the
monks’ striking arm. They are shocked
that Tri Quang’s temporal activities re-
quire him to travel with bodyguards and
that some of the far-from-humble priests
have acquired such worldly goods as ex-
pensive cars and air conditioners.
These protests have been thrust aside.
The United Buddhist Association of
Vietnam, which was formed in 1951, has
been supplanted by a new organisation
with the unusual name (since Buddhists
do not regard themselves as members of
a “church”) of the Unified Buddhist
Church. Its centre of power is another
new organisation, the Institute for the
Propagation of the Faith, also created by
monks against the protests of conserva-
tive Buddhists. This is a frankly secular
organisation, with ambitions and inten-
tions that go far beyond those once held
by the United Buddhist Association,
whose lay members registered their dis-
approval strongly in a letter to the Vener-
able Tinh Khiet, who in his late seventies
remains titular head of the High Buddhist
Council.
Politics and Pagodas
/”|rthodox lay Buddhists were relieved
that Thich Tam Chau, formerly
chairman of the Intersect Committee for
the Defence of Buddhism, a much more
moderate and gentle man, outmanoeuvred
Tri Quang in the election for the chair-
manship of the Institute for the Propaga-
tion of the Faith. Yet Tri Quang’s fol-
lowers, though a minority, control the
all-important youth and finance sections
of the institute, which in its structure and
organisation is virtually a parallel gov-
ernment to the government of South
Vietnam.
Tam Chau is generally regarded as
weak, but on occasion he has stepped
in to restrain Tri Quang’s political am-
bitions. On October 10, he issued a
courageous institute communique that
strongly condemned political agitation in
the name of Buddhism. He asked all Bud-
dhists to prevent the faith being used for
political movements and to exclude politi-
cal meetings from pagodas or other
church buildings.
The discord and frustration running
through Vietnamese political history are
reflected in Saigon today. Within 24
hours of its formation, the new civil
government under the premiership of
Tran Van Huong, sixty-one-year-old for-
mer mayor of Saigon, had come under
attack from all sides and was unani-
mously scorned by the Press. Saigon’s
forty daily newspapers have failed utterly
in helping to create national unity, or to
mobilise the active participation of the
people in the war. The profusion of
political parties only adds to the demoral-
isation; more than sixty had applied for
registration by October. Indistinguishable
in doctrines or in programmes, most of
them claimed a dozen members or less,
a situation that engenders agitation and
contributes nothing to political stability.
Such pervasive disunity will surely be
made even worse by the growth of Tri
Quang’s militant movement, a movement
that was strengthened in its beginnings by
US support of the Buddhists,
After sixteen years of watching Viet-
nam in the throes of war, political up-
heaval, and disaster, a remark Diem made
in 1962 seems to me brutally perti-
nent: “Anyone who follows me will
need to be even more of an absolute
ruler.” (From “The Reporter”, New
York.)
The Bible in One Hand...
The soul of South Africa
From ail Afrikaner Correspondent
Long, lazy shadows crawled ahead
of tired horse and rider as they put
their backs to the sun and made
for the cluster of trees that surrounded
the white farmhouse. Nestling in the
valley of low-lying hills at the edge of
the vast, flat veld, spread out for miles
under a carpet of green, shoulder-high
maize, the homestead beamed out a
welcome that urged the horse on. As
they reached the crest of a rise the rider
paused to give the horse a breather and
stared towards the east where, in the
distance, he could just see the spinning
headgear of one of the rich gold mines
of the new Free State goldfields.
As a farmer, he felt no resentment at
the encroachment of mining into his
domain. He and his father and his
father’s father had been maize farmers
as far back as his family history took
him. The soil under his horse’s hoofs
had been bought dearly with the blood
of his people who had sought only free-
dom and independence. Even so, he
would be quite willing to give it up to
mining or industry altogether, if by so
doing, he would be able to make some
contribution towards his country and
his people.
He was a South African and a fourth
generation descendant of those immortal,
Afrikaner pioneers who 125 years before
gave up their farms and their homes,
their comfort and their security in the
Cape Colony to face the unknown in a
hazardous trek across uncharted ter-
rain in search of freedom. With them
were their families who shared their
hopes and fears. Behind them they had
left the frustrations that were indivisible
from British colonial citizenship of the
mid-19th century.
Once across the Orange River, his
forefathers established their own re-
publics, created their own laws and a
new nation. With the Bible in their
hands and with the unshakable faith of
their destiny in their minds, they faced
both hardship and the warring natives in
their path with a courage and fortitude
that few men of their generation had to
endure.
In little more than 50 years, they
established not only two thriving re-
publics side by side, the Orange Free
State and the Transvaal, but they also
opened the way for the discovery of
the world’s richest supply of gold.
But having conquered the treacherous
black masses that harried and besieged
them, they survived, only to become the
victims of an avaricious imperialism that
coveted their gold. For nearly three
years in a bitter, unnecessary war they
fought bravely against the might of
Britain, only to succumb in 1902 from
exhaustion and near starvation.
All was lost. Or was it? Within six
years this vigorous young people were
on their feet again, pressing for and
receiving responsible government from
a conscience-stricken Liberal British
Government. A year later came a union
of the two British colonies, The Cape and
Natal, with the two former Afrikaner
republics of the Free State and the
Transvaal. Within two decades they
received Dominion status and self-
determination, and 35 years later com-
plete sovereignty as an independent re-
public, outside the Commonwealth.
War, even with its defeat for the
Afrikaners, had not been without its
compensations. Progress came with re-
habilitation. Money poured into the
country, with large-scale migration. The
steady build-up of nationhood could not
be checked. The pulsating desire of the
Afrikaner for recognition won out.
This was the real victory and it made
the young horseman proud to call him-
self an Afrikaner. His people have
reached full nationhood and are pros-
perous. The whole world wants the gold
and diamonds produced from their soil.
They have built up secondary industry
to the stage where they are independent
of nearly all foreign goods in any
emergency. Only oil is their Achilles
heel, but their vast, scarcely-tapped coal
reserves are now providing an increasing
quantity of oil from coal. Huge cities
have grown from villages and mining
camps. Water conservation schemes will


ensure food supplies for fourfold the
present population.
Ambitious defence programmes are
training the country’s young men and
women to defend their country against
attack. And the spirit of the people to
defend themselves is as strong as the
guns and machines at their disposal. For
the Afrikaner there is much to live for,
but even more to die for.
Only one shadow hangs over this
land the creeping shadow of liberal-
ism that has enslaved the world of 1964
and threatens to engulf this little nation,
the people of which want only to be
left alone to work out their own destiny.
The young Afrikaner on the hill
represents 3} million white people, more
than half of them Afrikaners, who have
invested their all in the Republic of
South Africa. They and their mothers
and fathers have made the country what
it is prosperous and progressive. They
have kept at bay the forces that threaten
to tear down their effort, and put back
the clock 100 years.
South Africa is their all. For the
majority of them, there is nowhere else
to go. If they are to survive at all, they
must remain where they are and hold on
to what they have built. There are no
alternatives, no compromises and there
can be no surrender to an international
liberalism that can only destroy them
and the things their forebears fought for.
The world is now asking these 31-
million white South Africans to share
their country on the basis of equality
with 11 million Africans, 101 million of
whom are totally unequipped and un-
qualified to share citizenship.
Fewer than 200,000 of these Africans
are capable of taking part in any form
of civil administration, even for their
own affairs. Three-quarters of the
African population still live in remote
tribal areas in much the same way as
their ancestors did 100 or more years
ago, when the early Afrikaner pioneers
were settling down in their newly-found
homeland.
True enough, white civilisation is
quickly rubbing off on to them. Some
3,000,000 Africans cluster round white
towns and cities providing the labor
force needed to keep the wheels of
mining and industry turning. They are
quickly learning the ways of the whites.
More and more Africans go to school,
high school and even university. There
are already 30,000 African teachers,
thousands of civil servants in administra-
tive offices serving the African people.
Hundreds of African women are in the
nursing profession and there are thou-
sands of African policemen. In addition,
scores of successful African businessmen
serve their own communities. Some of
them are in manufacturing, others run
service stations and trading stores in
African townships.
All in all, there could possibly be
found among this elite African society
enough sufficiently-trained and equip-
ped men and women to take over the
administration of say, Papua - New
Guinea. If it were they alone with whom
the white South Africans had to contend,
they would probably have been given
equality and full citizenship long ago.
As it is, however, they represent only
the spearhead of the African masses and
any concession to them in the way of
political rights must inevitably be fol-
lowed by the granting of full rights to all
Africans. The ultimate outcome would
be majority rule by the blacks, most of
whom would be mere pawns in the
voting game.
“What might have been”
HPhere is no point now in wistful con-
A jecture of “what might have been” had
the white of previous generations sought
an intermediate solution that would, at
best, have laid the foundation for some
sort of lasting friendship between black
and white. Nor can it be seen, at this
stage, how this could have been done
without establishing a precedent that
would, by this time, have demanded the
granting of political rights to a substan-
tial number of Africans.
The fact is that genuine friendship
between the races does not exist today.
The underlying emotion on the part of
the whites is fear and there is a
smouldering resentment of whites by
blacks. Regrettably, the prognosis for
any healthy change is not good. Un-
fortunately, too, the Government's Ban-
tustan, or separate homeland, plan can-
not be accepted as anything like a
solution. It is a last desperate throw of
the dice by the whites to keep their
country in white hands.
The Government is sincere in its
desire to give the African full develop-
ment and full political rights in his own
area, and to allow him to become a full
citizen in very sense of the word among
his own people. But all arguments in
favor of this solution are whipped away
by the wind. It needs no microscope to
reveal that 70 per cent of the population
cannot with any success be overcrowded
into 13 per cent of the land—and not
the best land at that.
Furthermore, the Bantustan plan
makes no provision for the 1,500,000
coloreds (mixed blood) and 500,000
Asians in the country. The three million
Africans working in the cities and towns
are told that they are not an integral
part of White South Africa, but must
look to the Bantustans for their political
future. Most of them are town and city-
bred. They have no knowledge of or
allegiance to these so-called homelands
which are, to them, nebulous expanses of
bush.
The whites have made South Africa
what it is, but the Africans can rightly
claim a share, for they provided the
labor and would have provided some of
the brains had they been given oppor-
tunities in the past for developing them.
While white South Africa maintains
rigid barriers against any form of social
integration, it has to accept economic
integration. It can separate white and
black in post offices and railway car-
riages, but it cannot separate them in
factories —even if separate wash rooms
and lunch counters are mandatory. Thus,
however much sympathy the Afrikaner
deserves for his problem, there can be
no moral justification for denying blacks
some say in the country they feel is as
much theirs as it is the whites’.
But what is the solution to this vexed
problem? Can the whites be expected
to hand over to a black proletariat
everything they have built? They have
already given a very definite “No”. And
to make sure there is no weakness on
anybody’s part, they have entrenched
apartheid so deeply in the legislature
that it would require a generation of
lawmakers to unravel it.
The need for restrictive laws has


brought restrictive practices and actions
that have angered the outside world. In
addition, apartheid pettiness has humili-
ated the blacks and has made them
anxious to reverse the pattern of domina-
tion by a minority. Hence the eagerness
of some to be misled into acts of sabo-
tage, terrorism and revolution.
How and when will the conflict end?
The whites are strong enough to main-
tain their superiority for at least an-
other 50 years if there is no outside
interference. At present they are a
match for any combination of African
States. But the high African birthrate
and the spread of learning among the
African people will tell ultimately and
will make internal pressure uncomfort-
able for the next generation of whites.
What then? The whites of the early
21st century may make a last desperate
gamble to maintain their position by
slicing the country through the middle
from north to south and handing over
the eastern half —the traditionally black
area —to the Africans and keeping the
western half white. They might go even
further and retire with a depleted popula-
tion—for many will leave the sinking
ship—to a small white enclave in the
Cape Province on the southern tip of
the country where their history began.
They would do this rather than surrender
to multi-racial and eventual, black rule.
But in the end they are doomed as
white supremacists. The forces against
them will be too strong. It would seem
that only a miracle could save them. On
the other hand, a miracle might not be
necessary.
A new generation of Afrikaners might
be able to face up to integration, and
a new, black generation may have no
thought for hate and revenge.
The Murder Bill
The end of the Death Penalty
From LOUIS-BLOM COOPER in London
Britain's hangman’s noose is well on
its way to the museum, to join the
rack, the thumbscrew and the
scold’s bridle. But if capital punishment
is going out of our penal practice with
little more than a whimper, Mr Sidney
Silverman's Bill to abolish it will not pass
through Parliament entirely unchallenged.
The retentionists are bent on ensuring that
whatever punishment replaces hanging it
should be adequate, in every sense of
that word* and should entail a longer
period in prison than is currently thought
to be involved in a life sentence.
Only a few years ago the Lord Chief
Justice, Lord Parker, gave notice that
he was willing to contemplate abolition,
mainly because the 1957 Homicide Act,
in its chimerical search for discriminating
between categories of murder, had be-
come judicially objectionable to adminis-
ter. But he also made it clear that he
wanted the judges to be given the power
to pass, if necessary, sentences of 25 to
30 years’ imprisonment.
In “The Guardian” on November 26,
John Grigg echoed a similar, if slightly
more illiberal, sentiment: “All convicted
murderers should as a matter of course
be imprisoned for life, to be released only
in exceptional cases.” (Mr Grigg might
be surprised to know the exception has
been, and will continue to be, the rule.
As Mr R. A. Butler, a former Home
Secretary, said in 1961, the great majority
of murders are “committed by relatives
often in circumstances which allow a
compassionate view to be taken”.)
The Murder (Abolition of Death
Penalty) Bill provides for all murders the
penalty which has existed for non-capital
murder since 1957, namely, automatic
life imprisonment. The controversy
centres around what “life” will mean
and around the myth that nine years Js
the average time served by murderers.
Where does this myth originate, and
what relevance does it have to a post-
abolition policy of release procedure?
Before 1957 murderers serving life im-
prisonment were those who had had their
sentences commuted—the death sentence
was at that time mandatory for all con-
victed of murder. By definition there
were always mitigating features about
their crimes. Otherwise they would not
have been reprieved. The minority of
murderers whose crimes most outraged
public feeling presented no problem—
monsters, like Haigh, Christie and Heath,
society destroyed.
But though it is true that most mur-
derers whose sentences were commuted
could reasonably expect to serve some-
thing like nine years, this never was a
mathematical average. The periods
served by murderers ranged from the
short terms for the killing committed
under great stress of emotion—some
mercy killers and survivors of suicide
pacts have been released after as little
as one, two or three years—to those
cases where reprieve was granted on the
slenderest of mitigating circumstances,
which meant that the killer might serve
anything up to 20 years. Certainly the
minimum for such cases was eight or
nine years.
For the bulk of murderers, who before
abolition would have been reprieved,
something up to nine years will probably
remain the normal term served. To this
extent there will be no change in the
release policy which has been so success-
ful throughout the years. The problem
now is what to do with the compara-
tively small number of murderers who
come in the post-1957 capital murder
category and a few of the non-capital
cases about which public anxiety is
understandably most acute. This will
probably not involve more than a dozen
cases a year.
If it is convenient to retain life impri-
sonment as the mandatory sentence for
all murderers, the public is entitled to a
guarantee that a life sentence never be-
comes an empty formula. And while it
is unnecessary, indeed harmful, to pre-
determine a man’s incarceration as far in
advance as, say, 25 years, dangerous
killers, particularly the aggressive psycho-
path, must not be let loose on the public.
The Judges' desire to pass such long sen-
tences, therefore, must be respected as
springing from a genuine sense of duty.
If in any particular case there is any
risk, we should not shrink from the un-
pleasant task of saying that a murderer
must remain in prison a very long time,
even possibly for the rest of his natural
life. (Here, however, it should be said
that the best arbiters of how long a man
serving a lengthy sentence must be kept
in a cage—for that is what prison is—
are those who have the day-to-day task
of administering the penal system.)
There is little real cause for fear of
premature release. (Of the 76 murder-
ers released between 1955 and 1960 only
two were subsequently convicted of any
crime of violence.) The case of Christo-
pher Simcox (who committed a second
murder after being released in 1958 for
a murder committed in 1948) did prompt
some doubt earlier this year about re-
lease procedure. As a result of that case
the pre-release medical examinations by
the prison medical service are being
tightened up, and the after-care control
of released prisoners by the probation
service is also under review.
The public might feel even more secure
if there were some independent body
which acted as a buffer between the
Home Secretary and the public, and made
recommendations about the safety of
releasing “lifers”. In a recent book, “A
Calendar of Murder”, Dr Terence Mor-
ris and I argued that the Government
should establish a Parole Board presided
over by a High Court Judge, which would
advise the Home Secretary. Similarly,
the Board could recommend those cases
where hospital treatment rather than
prison is required.
The more society, by its representa-
tives, has a say in the difficult task of
determining the length of a killer’s period
in custody the more the responsibility is
shared by those who ought to bear it,
namely, the public in whose name such
severe penal sanctions are exacted, (ofns)


AROUND MELBOURNE
The Hot Dog is Still Too Thin
Radio Australia: the world’s most successful
Tt’s the very devil even to find Radio
Australia. The address is Leichardt
Street, Melbourne, but Leichardt Street
is just an ugly little lane that runs between
Lonsdale Street and Little Lonsdale
Street, an area that was notorious one
time for somewhat gay professional acti-
vities.
From the outside Radio Australia itself
looks like a soup factory of a boiling
down works, quite impoverished. Inside
it looks better, but at best, cramped and
temporary. Yet this is the world’s most
successful radio station. For the past
eight years, according to the Interna-
tional Shortwave Club, Radio Australia
has been the world’s most listened-to
overseas service. Not only is it ahead,
but it’s way ahead. Radio Australia is
first with 23 per cent of the listeners, the
BBC is second with 12 per cent, then
Radio Nederland 11.6, Swiss Broadcast-
ing Service 9.44, then the mighty Voice
of America fifth with 8.22. Radio Mos-
cow is way down ninth with 2.3.
It is possible to detect a certain satis-
faction amongst some of the Radio Aus-
tralia folk. The ABC home service, both
on radio and television, struggles for
listeners and viewers at the bottom of the
ratings, whereas the impoverished child,
Radio Australia, leads the world’s ratings
with an audience beyond any ABC an-
nouncer’s dreams. The overseas service
claims a regular audience of over 50 mil-
lion. And they do this with an annual
budget of £330,000 compared to £27 mil-
lion for Voice of America.
There was a special reason for the visit
to Leichardt Street. On December 20
Radio Australia will be celebrating its
25th birthday. Late in 1939 Cabinet de-
cided that Australia needed a voice over-
seas, a service that could give the news
impartially, something to counteract Ger-
man propaganda.
George Ivan Smith, now a United
Nations representative in Africa, then an
ABC man in Sydney, was chosen as the
first chief of the Overseas Service. The
Minister for Information, Sir Henry
Gullett gave him just one week to put the
show on the air.
It was a desperate week. Seeing that
he had a gift for languages John Royle
came in as the first announcer. Amal-
gamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd pro-
vided the transmitters they used for the
peacetime radio telephone service and
they were known as VLQ and VLQ2.
And so the Prime Minister, Mr R. G.
Menzies, opened the service on his birth-
day, December 20, 1939. It was “Aus-
tralia Calling” then, the name Radio
Australia did not come until much later.
In 1964, perhaps we would wince a little
at the opening, but it sounded pretty
good then. John Royle said “VLQ, VLQ
... V for Victory, L for Liberty, Q for
Quality, Australia calling the world.”
Mr Menzies made a speech. Peter
Dawson sang “Advance Australia Fair”,
Percy Grainger played his own composi-
tion “Country Gardens”, there was the
recording of Dame Nellie Melba singing
“Clair de Lune”.
John Royle introduced a programme
of Australian sounds, of bellbirds, a cor-
roboree and the sound of axemen felling
trees in the Gippsland forests. Trade
commissioners, friendly embassies and
such sent back their reports. The British
Minister at Sofia, Bulgaria, cabled his
congratulations. Reception had been
just fine. It couldn’t be heard at all in
Washington but on the other hand the
BBC picked it up so well they put the
programme on their home service.
In 1939 it was a rather frail little
affair, often called Australia’s tin whistle
in the Pacific. The transmitters were
weak and the emphasis was all European,
with sessions in English, German, Dutch,
French and Spanish. Now we go blat-
antly for an Asian market with services in
Indonesian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japan-
ese, Thai, Vietnamese, English and
French. French and English are the only
Western languages used.
But if you really want to dissect Radio
Australia the thing to do is to look at the
correspondence. The intimate associa-
tion with Indonesia is something quite
extraordinary and something which has
never been adequately publicised. While
Sir Robert and Dr Soekarno confront
each other in their public statements the
ordinary people of Indonesia write to us.
And they write letters by the thousand.
Radio Australia nigh on a quarter-
million letters a year and just on half of
these come from Indonesia. The record
flow was 283,045 during 1963.
There was one incredible day, May 15,
1963, when there was a freak shipping
arrival. There were 24,463 letters from
Indonesia all in one day, four times the
entire correspondence that Radio Aus-
tralia received in 1950. Miss Jean Pratt
in the correspondence section said: “We
just couldn’t believe our eyes. The letters
kept coming and coming, bag after bag.
It took six of us eight days to clear
them.” This year correspondence is down
a little, and the year will see a total rather
less than 250,000. The reason is simple
enough, there’s been an increase in postal
charges in Indonesia.
Radio Australia does well because In-
donesia has just the one radio service,
“You despise me, don't you?“

the very solemn Radio Republic Indone-
sia. It has to reach all the scattered
islands and it too is short wave. So
Radio Australia is another strong station
on the dial. Then, seeing that Dr Soe-
karno doesn’t approve of the Beatles or
Elvis or most of the pop singers, Radio
Australia makes a real killing.
There has been criticism of the service
for giving the Indonesians too much pop
music. But this is what they want. It
is a young audience and they adore
guitar twangers with maybe Elvis pulling
rather stronger than the Beatles.
So far the Indonesian Government has
done nothing, actively, to stop the ser-
vice. Maybe this is because Radio Aus-
tralia does provide useful services like the
teaching of English. Most of the letters
written in Indonesian are requests for
pop music and information. At Leic-
hardt Street there’s a staff of 16 Indone-
sians to cope with the requests and the
Indonesian language services.
Recently a Chinese girl in Indonesia
wrote 200 letters in one day, all with a
particular object, to get her favorite
record on the air. Mr Stan Thurlow,
the correspondence officer, says that the
girl was trying to impress by flooding the
place with letters. “We get so many
requests there's a lag before various
records actually get on the air. But
some of the letters come from little places
which are very isolated. Don’t you see,
there’s tremendous prestige to be had
in having one’s name mentioned over
Radio Australia. They’ll do anything.”
Then there are the questions that have
to be answered. Not many of them are
political. Most of them show a childlike
wonder and most a goodwill towards Aus-
tralia. I looked through hundreds of
them.
“It is said in the scriptures that God
created man after His own likeness. Then
why are some people white-skinned while
others are colored?”
“What is the speed of a flying bee?”
“What causes pimples?”
“What is the Australian’s general
appearance—does he look like a Euro-
pean, an Indian or a Chinese?”
“Who and where is the world's oldest
man?”
“What is the origin of the Australian
custom of not working on Saturday?”
Then there was this request for a
record, which was rather appealing, from
a man in Kyoto, Japan. “I would like
to hear the rag that is played on 12th
avenue.”
At Radio Australia there is some
astonishment at their own success. No-
body is dead certain as to why they are
so high on the charts. Peter Homfray,
who has been the director since 1957,
Puts it down to the lack of political pro-
paganda, that unlike other overseas ser-
vices it is not peddling any particular
line. There’s a real, friendly warmth in
the presentation.
This, of course, is true. One suspects
also that Radio Australia has the shrewd-
ness of a 2UW or a 3UZ. It gives its
public precisely what it wants, lots of
pops and lots of entertainment. The
talks too are extremely homely and inter-
esting. There’s a stream of them pouring
out every week on what Australians are
doing ... on footy, on Moomba, on
gathering oysters, spear fishing, Christ-
mas camping at Portsea, on touring the
outback with Allan Aldous. And if we
do put over propaganda it’s of a very
subtle kind, that these Australians really
don't sound like aggressive monsters.
fThiERE are news commentaries and here
A Radio Australia does suffer from a
split personality. It is under a Commis-
sion, and is therefore supposed to be an
utterly independent body with its own
ideas. In all fairness, there does seem to
be a genuine desire for it to be that way.
But the person who tunes in, whether it
be from Hanoi or Djakarta, doesn’t
understand the subtleties of a Commis-
sion, he takes it for granted that Radio
Australia means the official voice of Aus-
tralia. So all commentaries get vetted
representative of the Department of
External Affairs. Nothing that is likely
to harm our image goes over.
The star of Radio Australia, the man
who is infinitely better known in Karachi,
Bangkok and Kyoto, than in Melbourne,
is Keith Glover. He has a very warm,
chatty style, almost as if he were running
a nice little club. He conducts the mail-
bag session, and he tries to answer over
the air some of those 200,000 letters.
The session starts with the notorious
cry of the kookaburra. Keith Glover
says it completely floors the new listeners.
They write in wanting to know whether
it is a laughing hyena, a wild turkey, a
mad canary or maybe somebody in bad
shape. A station booklet says that at
Linden, New Jersey, USA, neighbors of
one Radio Australia fan complained that
he kept “a rooster which crowed loudly
and hoarsely'’ every morning and woke
them up.
Keith Glover gets a varied audience.
The other day he had a letter from Indo-
nesia: “Mr Glover, I am 17, what is the
right age to fall in love?” There was
another from Sherwood, Nottingham.
The writer pointed out that the aerial of
his radio was attached to his wire mat-
tress and that he would be a guaranteed
fan for a long, long time. He went on
to say that he was doing a 10-year gaol
sentence.
Then he is rather proud of the letter
that came from Dr R. L. Griffith of the
US. On January 16, this year, his yacht
Awahnee was wrecked on the atoll of
Vahanga in the Acteon Group of the
Tuamotu Islands. Along with his wife
and son he was shipwrecked for 67 days.
Every night they filled in time listening
to Radio Australia.
Then there’s Mrs Jeejee Bhoy who lives
"Thank you, and the same to you.”

near Bombay. He liked her last letter;
there was an obvious interruption in the
middle of it. Mrs Jeejee Bhoy continued:
“I was very sorry to leave you there the
other night, there was a tiger under the
house.” Also among the regular listeners
are the monks of a Buddhist monastery
in southern Thailand. They report that,
regrettably, Radio Australia news bul-
letins coincide with their regular devo-
tions. But they have beaten this problem.
Before going to prayers they set up a
tape recorder beside the radio.
But the major battle with Radio Aus-
tralia is for more power. It is being
crowded off the air by the big guns of
Radio Peking, Radio Moscow and even
friends like the BBC and Voice of
America. The PMG has a project before
the Parliamentary Works committee for
three new 250 kilowatt transmitters to
be installed at Darwin at a cost of
£2,704,000. This would double the
punch of Radio Australia. The Darwin-
type transmitters are all-important for
the new type of overseas broadcasting.
We must be heard easily on the cheap
transistorised radios which Asians now
own in millions.
For example there’s been a letter from
a listener in Nadroga, Fiji. He says
he has trouble raising Radio Australia
because it comes in too close to three
clamoring stations on the left and two
on the right. And he put it rather beau-
tifully:
“Your station is like a very thin hot
dog clamped between two large pieces
of bun. We can get the bun but not the
sausage.”

How To Use
The Wine Waiter
Christmas reflections
The book of the year is “Hunter
Wine”, the author Max Lake. Lake
was featured in this column some
months ago when I discussed his new
Hunter vineyard, and this simple volume
is further proof of his enormous enthusi-
asm for wine and his wish to do some-
thing more positive about it than just
drink it. It is the first book on Hunter
wine that I have read and I feel sure
the only one in print. It may well be the
only one ever written.
Started over five years ago, it went the
rounds of the publishers, was revised here
and there, languished as other things
occupied Lake’s interest, was resurrected
by the cheery encouragement of a friend
in the business, revised again, and now
finally emerges.
The result is worthwhile to any lover
of wine who wants to know more about
it. After a rather repetitious foreword
by the GOM of wine, M. Andre Simon,
the author plunges straight into his sub-
ject with a vivid, concise description of
the valley and the grapes found there.
There follows excellent chapters on the
origin of wine-making in the area, the
wine-makers from the originals to those
of today, the wines they made and make,
together with an analysis of recent vint-
ages and the struggles everyone seems to
have gone through to make some of the
finest wines produced in this country.
The Hunter Valley produces wines of
a stature out of all significance to the
acreage planted and the almost cowshed-
like proportions of the wineries, and the
author has lovingly etched a picture of
them which must please any man who, in
the best possible sense, is in the grip of
the grape.
The writing varies in quality. I found
it hard to believe the same man had writ-
ten the beautiful evocation on Audrey
Wilkinson, the late wine-maker and
Hunter Valley historian, and the school-
boy essay-ish grand tour of the vineyards,
. . we leave the bitumen and strike out
westward . . . but we have a big day
ahead and must decline . . . brindle dog,
athwart the shaded verandah . . . etc.,
etc.” There are other faults; contradic-
tions and omissions which must inevitably
be revised. I found the appendix on
cooking completely unnecessary and the
surgeon could well perform here. The
book could be extended in other ways
with greater emphasis on what is happen-
ing today.
Finally: Buy it.
Tn the November issue of the influential
American magazine Holiday, Mr
Silas Spitzer, the Food Editor, writes at
length of his impressions of Australia. He
was here a few months ago and seemed
to enjoy himself enormously. Though
his remarks are not all laudatory, he has
many fine things to say about the two
principal cities he visited, Sydney and
Melbourne, and the food served in the
restaurants and hotels there. He dis-
courses at length about the pretty girls,
the atmosphere, vitality and charm of the
cities, and speaks highly of them all.
But in the realm of wine Mr Spitzer
really enthuses.
This, for him, was the highlight of his
stay: the excellence of our wines. I may
take a little credit for this discovery, for
I was present when he tasted them first.
He was quite overwhelmed. We accept
that one per cent of the complete produc-
tion of the wines of France and Ger-
many are the greatest in the world. In
the next rank, ours rival, and frequently
outpoint all others. Mr Spitzer was not
only completely unaware that this could
be true, he had never heard that we had
any wine at all! The wines he tasted
were not all top show wines. Each of
them could have been bought at one time
or other in any Bottle Shop worthy of

the name. I don't know if we have repre-
sentatives in the States or anywhere
except the UK. But it does seem that
there is some failing somewhere when
such an influential man has never seen
a word about our wine nor tasted a single
drop.
Anyway, at least this has been rectified
in his case and now not only he, but
also the readers of Holiday, may be en-
couraged to enjoy our wines.
Inhere is always comment about the ser-
A vice of wine in restaurants and
hotels. In many cases there seems to be a
latent hostility in Australia towards wine
and drink waiters, a suspicion that he is
going to try to “do” you with wine that
even now they are stamping out in the
kitchen with liberal help from the hose-
pipe and metho. bottle. His often quite
sincere advice is rejected through either
ignorance or embarrassment, and gener-
ally he becomes nothing more than a
bottle carrier and opener.
This is a shame, for a good wine
waiter can be intelligently helpful. To
those who like wine but know little, he
can guide and suggest; to those with more
understanding he can quickly put forward
the best his establishment has to offer
when asked for a particular type. With
an understanding of his cellar he can
submit various “specials” to his regular
customers and, indeed, greatly influence
the whole pattern of buying and selling.
Can this paragon of vinous virtues be
found? Waiting as a profession is not
highly regarded in this democratic land,
but this doesn't mean that there are not
good waiters about. Many new settlers
who were waiters overseas, find it both
lucrative and interesting to continue their
occupation here. There are many locals,
especially in the southern cities, who
make a good living and yet do not dis-
parage their work. The Wine Guild,
formed by the Wine and Brandy Pro-
ducers’ Association, guides and helps all
the above and any newcomers to the
game, encouraging them to learn more
and to understand developments within
the industry, all for the purpose of better
service to the public.
So it is up to you to use these people
correctly. Australians who aren’t suspi-
cious seem to enjoy a little friendliness,
a touch of familiarity removed from the
complete and impersonal unobtrusive-
ness that was once considered ideal. We
like something in between these two “ser-
vice” stories, which I use to illustrate the
point:
The first happened to me in New
Zealand. The door of my room was
thrown open one morning by a Maori
girl, still in her “finest”, one ear-ring
missing, a little the worse for wear,
obviously having come straight to work
from an all-night party. The cup of
tea was thumped on to the bedside table.
“Do youse take sugar in youse tea?”
she asked hoarsely.
“No, thank you,” I replied.
“Then youse better not stir it then.”
★ ★ ★
The second was said to have happened
at the Rothschilds in England before the
last war. Again the early morning re-
freshment. An under-butler wheeled in
a trolley and quietly drew the curtains.
“Good morning, sir. May I suggest
some coffee, tea, or juices?”
“Tea, thank you.”
‘Certainly sir. India, Ceylon or China
sir?”
“Er . . . Ceylon, thank you.”
“Certainly sir. Mint, milk or lemon,
sir?”
“Milk, thank you.”
“Guernsey or Hereford, sir?”
★ ★ ★
Finally:
Head Waiter: A brandy, quick! A lady
has fainted!
Waiter: Yes, sir. Local or imported?

Letters to the Editor
No Hope
SIR. —This may be classed as typical of
our thinking a good example of “cen-
sorship and the official mind”. An inspec-
tor from the Education Department, visit-
ing a school on the South Coast, asked
for the removal of a number of books
from the senior classes’ shelves of the
school library on the grounds that he
considered them to be unsuitable, even
for Fourth and Fifth year scholars.
Among the shocking authors was Austra-
lia's A. D. Hope. Recently scholars from
this school sat for the English Honors
Paper in the current Leaving Certificate
examination a paper which was issued
under the name of this inspector, among
others. Sure enough the only Austra-
lian author in the poetry questions was
A. D. Hope. No further comment seems
to be necessary.
E. C. SAVAGE
Windang (NSW).
The Death Penalty
SIR. —In reply to Gordon Elawkins
(B. —December 12): (1.) I have diffi-
culty in establishing that category of per-
sons “not already brutalised . . . by . . .
complicity in the mass killing of the inno-
cent” such that they are “unlikely to be
much (my italics) affected” by execution.
On the other hand, those not so lucky
presumably, on Mr Hawkins’ argument,
simply become more brutalised.
(2.) Conceding murder to be the worst
crime, if the death penalty deters murder-
ers and is supported for that reason, then
its supporters are logically involved in
considering its use in other “bad” crimes
(e.g., rape, kidnapping, aggravated as-
sault) which it would, presumably, all
the more deter.
(3.) To describe a “thing” viz. the in-
flicting of the death penalty as a “ghastly
ritual” seems to me to be informative and
not purely emotive (whether or not it
is true) in a way in which a description
of criminals (a complex and varied class
of persons) as “beasts” is not.
A. KARPIN
Lind field (NSW).
Young Poets
SIR. —In conjunction with the Common-
wealth Arts Festival to be held in Britain
next year, the Festival organisers are
planning to bring out an anthology of
poetry entitled Young Commonwealth
Poets ’65. I have accepted the invitation
to edit the Australian section of this an-
thology and, in order to make the anthol-
ogy as representative as possible of the
best work of the younger generation of
our poets, I am wondering if you could
help me by making the need for contri-
butions known through your columns.
As you may know, a recent proposed
anthology of Australian poetry and prose
was rejected by the “Penguin” publishing
house in England, as being of insufficient
quality. In order to avoid a similar result
in the present case, I am particularly
anxious to detect younger writers who
may not have published sufficiently
widely yet to attract attention.
The essential points are: (1.) The an-
thology is entitled Young Commonwealth
Poets ’65. It is to be brought out in
conjunction with The Commonwealth
Arts Festival to be held in Britain next
year. (2.) Two or three examples of
recent work are invited from younger
poets, preferably in their 20s, but, in any
case, under forty. Work preferred is that
which exhibits a break from prevailing
“safe” attitudes and, ideally, is repre-
sentative of a new poetic generation. Ex-
perimental and socially responsive work
is particularly sought. (3.) The space avail-
able for Australia in the anthology is not
fixed but is dependent on the quality of
Australian contributions relative to other
Commonwealth countries. The extent of
our representation depends on what we
have to offer. (4.) A closing date for sub-
mission of copy has not been set, but
it is essential that contributions be for-
warded as soon as possible. (5.) Contribu-
tions should be forwarded to Noel Mac-
ainsh, at Eltham Road, Warrandyte, Vic-
toria, accompanied by a stamped addres-
sed envelope. Brief autobiographical notes
will be required of those poets whose
work is selected for publication. (6.) Un-
published work is preferred, but pub-
lished work is acceptable provided it is
accompanied by the author’s assurance
that it is cleared for world-wide publica-
tion in the proposed anthology.
In case it should'be relevant, I might
identify myself further by saying that
my own work in poetry is represented in
various journals and anthologies, includ-
ing the recently published group anthol-
ogy “Eight by Eight”. I was also selected
to represent Australia in the “Inter-
national Literary Annual” about three
years ago. I have just completed a study

Promoting Wool
SlR.—Tanner’s cartoon in your issue
October 17 appearing on page 12, would
be very good if he used the word “Pro-
motion” instead of “Reserve Price”. As it
is, it only adds confusion to the already
muddled thinking of growers and public
alike. Promotion is of national concern.
If the Government want it, they should
pay for it. The cost of the Reserve price
authority could easily be maintained by
the growers and wool brokers. A Govern-
ment guarantee is desirable only to main-
tain confidence.

SIR. —As a person who is in a position
to know, I must protest regarding the
article which appeared (B. —Nov. 28) on
the Victorian Symphony Orchestra.
It is redolent with untruths one can
only surmise the source of the misinfor-
mation— to quote just one statement.
The idea regarding a change in orchestral
timing came from the visiting Dutch
conductor Cluytens not Mr Clare.
This is fact not fiction.

Censorship
SIR. —The question of censorship ap-
pears to be looming larger. The height
of absurdity seems to have been reached
with the restrictions imposed on books
for Professor Martin, by the Customs
Department if the facts are in accordance
with the reporting (B. —Dec. 5). Lately
an organisation, composed largely of
academics, was established in Victoria to
abolish censorship following the near-ban
on “The Group”, while at the same time,
up north where everything is pure, an-
other organisation was established by
clerical and other worthies to ban every-
thing containing even the slightest sus-
picion of earthy language. What happens
if these two bodies meet?
Without a doubt most people seem to
favor some restrictions while the aca-
demics, often with extreme views, really
lay themselves open not only to criticism
but action such as that imposed on Pro-
fessor Martin’s books by the Customs
Department. These books are, of course,
not meant for young students but for
mature adults. There was a time, and
not so long ago, out at Queensland Uni-
versity, when the parents of eighteen- and
nineteen-year-olds rose up in righteous
wrath when poems extolling the delights
of a woman’s thighs were read to a mixed
audience. The academics cannot have it
all their own way, nor, of course, can the
clerics and other worthies.

English in the Mass
“So much for the Liturgical ' Revolution ' ”
By RICHARD NEWPORT
Like Australian Rules football, the
English text approved for the
people's use at Mass in Australia
seems at first sight to be an amalgam
of differing codes, American and English.
The comparison falls down because, un-
like the rules of football, this Australian
Mass - amalgam is purely accidental.
Working separately, the Hierarchies of
America, England and Australia pro-
duced three versions of an English
language liturgy for use in their respec-
tive countries similar in general outline
but with confusing and inexplicable
variations in detail.
In the English-speaking world, Aus-
tralia was first in the field and had five
clear months’ start by the time England
and America swung into action on the
first Sunday of Advent, November 29.
It was hoped that this date would see
the end of the harassing restrictions im-
posed by Rome on the full
implementation of the Aus-
tralian Hierarchy’s decision
of last June. This reversal
has meant the retention of
the prayers at the foot of
the altar and the Last Gos-
pel despite their omission in
the official text now in use,
which was printed before
the about-turn in July. (This
hope was roused by the fact
that the version approved for England
which became operative on November
29 leaves these prayers out. The Roman
authorities have apparently thought twice
before humiliating the English Hier-
archy as it did the Australian. What
scandal or danger to the faith Rome
hoped to avoid by their reversal of the
Australian Bishops’ decision is hard for
ordinary priests or people to appreciate
■— but then, of course, they were never
consulted.
A comparison of the three versions
shows that Australia is the most consist-
ent and leads the field in the actual
amount of English permitted. The version
approved for England retains the archaic
“Thee—Thou” whenever God is referred
to but permits the “You” form on other
occasions. The Americans have, like us,
been consistent—“ You” replaces “Thou”
except in the traditional “Lord’s Prayer”.
Those who must at some stage attempt
to set the approved texts to music will
have to work largely on a national basis
because the versions of, for example, the
Gloria and the Creed differ and music
which would fit one set of words would
not easily fit another. Take the Creed:
England:
I look for the resurrection of the
dead.
America:
I await the resurrection of the dead.
Australia:
I look forward to the resurrection
of the dead.
As for mixture of language used there
is a most confusing assortment. America
and Australia, with differing introduc-
tions, recite the Lord’s Prayer in English
England, in Latin.
This uneasy partnership between
Australia and America prevails also for
the Sanctus and Last Blessing again,
England has retained the Latin. One of
the weirdest aberrations is America’s re-
tention of Latin for the public prayers
(Collect and Post Com-
munion). England has
avoided this folly and so
have we.
All three have retained
the Preface in Latin, though
the Australian Bishops re-
quested it to be in English.
This request was refused by
the Roman authorities,
which leaves this beautiful
and largely unknown prayer
in Australia and in America (though not
in England) wedged in between two slabs
of English. The awkwardness and un-
desirability of this arrangement are
apparent in Australia after nearly six
months of use and many priests have
simply disregarded official direction in
the matter and swung over to English,
probably to preserve their own sanity
and their people’s patience.
This leads me to question the com-
petence of the Roman Liturgical authori-
ties to pronounce on the adequacy or
otherwise of the translations presented
to them for approval by the national
Hierarchies. Such reference would be
meaningful only on the assumption that
there existed in Rome experts whose
knowledge of the subtleties of the English
language would qualify them to offer an
opinion. Jf such exist I for one have yet
to hear of them.
The whole thing is rather absurd and
yet one more example of unnecessary and
pinpricking interference from Rome, in-
terference, one cannot help thinking,
motivated not so much by pastoral con-
siderations as by the desire to keep the
Bishops in their place. The Bishops,

through long years of conditioning, have
not reached the stage, at least in Aus-
tralia, of openly questioning the system,
though dissatisfaction is often voiced in
private and often with vehemence.
What we have achieved in Australia in
liturgical matters is considerable and
commendable but, on the overall picture,
the whole of the English-speaking world
is only slowly catching up with many
other parts of the Church. We have a
long way to go even to reach where
France, Germany and Holland, for ex-
ample, were five or even ten years ago.
Patch work liturgy
T'he same patchwork, bilingual liturgy
operates in such areas as the Chinese
speaking parts of the free East Hong
Kong, Formosa and Macao. Here Chin-
ese is permitted in most parts where
English is used in Australia, Latin being
still retained for the rest . . . These
changes made under Pope Paul VI came
three and a half centuries after the per-
mission granted by Pope Paul V in 1615
to use Chinese for the entire Liturgy.
Paul V’s permission was never imple-
mented and was subsequently revoked.
This disastrous policy can be traced to
Curial timidity at the time and inter-
Order jealousy. So, even here, what is
now permitted for the Chinese does not
go as far as what was permitted 350
years ago. So much for the current
Liturgical “Revolution”.
What of the future —at least, as far
as Australia is concerned? What has been
achieved so far is almost entirely a mat-
ter of language. The rite remains basi-
cally unchanged. A general overhaul and
simplification of the entire rite is under
way and a new revised rite is anticipated
within five years. Some of the changes
become operative in March next year.
Every priest and many laymen have
their own ideas and suggestions as to
desirable changes, but they have so far
been given no opportunity to voice them.
This is unfortunate as the success or
failure of the whole liturgical revival
depends not so much on the Bishops
as on the willing and enthusiastic
co-operation of the ordinary priest and
his congregation. Priests and people have
gone beyond the stage of doing things
simply because they are told to do them.
It is to be hoped that when the re-
vised rite is published it will make the
answering of these largely unnecessary or,
at least, easier. Perhaps it is still not too
late for priests and people to be given the
opportunity openly to express their
opinions. Despite what many Bishops may
fondly imagine, not every idea which does
not originate from them is unworthy of
notice. To continue to act as if it were is
to bury the Episcopal head still deeper
in the sand.


REVIEWS
FILMS
Pygmalion with Songs
By DAVID MARTIN
My Fair Lady. Director, George Cukor.
My Fair Lady Theatre, Melbourne.
“Pygmalion” carries a note by its author:
“A complete presentation of the play is
technically possible only on the cinema
screen or on a stage furnished with ex-
ceptionally elaborate machinery.” That’s
perfectly true. “Pygmalion” in its
original form reads like a screenplay with
abnormally heavy dialogue. It doesn’t
stick to any one set, it moves freely in
time and locale. When it was turned
into a musical it did not lose much, if
anything, except in characterisation
and that was already the weakest part of
the comedy. Eliza and Professor Higgins
are good fun, but you can accept them
only as representing an extreme paradox.
The same goes for Alfred Doolittle, that
dustman turned lecturer in moral
philosophy.
The ■ evolution from play to straight
film, and from musical into the present
extravaganza was, of course, inevitable.
The film sticks (wisely, I think) as closely
to the musical as possible: the sumptuous
has been made more sumptuous, every
incident has been given an added robust-
ness and the London atmosphere has
been made even more authentic.
Eliza has undergone her last meta-
morphosis. It would never do to present
her to the fans as the unwashed scare-
crow Shaw first imagined at Covent Gar-
den, and Audrey Hepburn has not even
been asked to try. From the beginning
she is simply a London Cinderella wait-
ing for her Prince Charming, and it’s
her bad luck that she falls into Higgins’
clutches before she sinks into Freddy’s
tender arms. In a way this is sad, be-
cause it means that we miss that one
great moment of theatre when the
guttersnipe emerges from Mrs Pierce’s
bathroom in a Japanese wrap, a vision
of the lady she will soon be. There’s no
chrysalis for Miss Hepburn: she’s always
a lovely butterfly.
She and Rex Harrison are the stars,
but the greatest performance comes from
Stanley Holloway as the elder Doolittle.
This is a remarkable performance by a
comic who had to wait thirty years for
a role which could bring out his
astonishing range. George Cukor lets
him rip to such purpose that he dwarfs
his partners. One moment he roisters
like a beefy Cyrano, the next he ex-
pounds his philosophy so that we can
almost believe him.
A morning preview, with workmen
still hammering away behind the drapes,
may not be the ideal setting for the
film, but I am prepared to say that no
customer will think himself cheated. For
this Cecil Beaton must take the credit.
At its best, “My Fair Lady” has the airy
grandeur of “Around the World in 80
Days”. The famous Ascot scenes, with
their luminous pastels, are unforgettable.
The great reception, at which Eliza
enchants the Prince of Transylvania, is
marvellously designed. Here the har-
mony between sounds, movement, dress
and decor reaches a perfection which is
nearly impossible on the stage and which
justifies Jack Warner’s heroic ex-
penditures.
At other times there is a feeling of
claustrophobia. There are too many
browns and blacks, and the color, which
does wonders for hats and flowers, is
unkind to human flesh. Rex Harrison,
whose bravura never wearies, appears to
have been exposed to infra-red lamps,
and Eliza, like Ylnconnue de la Seine,
appears to have spent two days in a
river.
Audrey Hepburn is beautiful in a
bony sort of way, and she can be be-
witching, but apart from not being a
bedraggled Cockney she also is not a
vengeful fury when she should be. Now
and then I thought she had strayed out
of “Saint Joan”. Ah! If only Wendy
Hiller had had the gift of eternal youth!
The songs, of course, are as fresh as
ever, and if one or two have lost a
little of their sparkle this could be
because they have been dubbed in. There
isn’t much dancing, and Hermes Pan’s
choreography expresses itself chiefly in
animated grouping. The minor roles (Col.
Pickering, Young Freddy and Zoltan
Karpaty) are, of course, admirably
played.
In its odd way the new “My Fair
Lady” again brings home how much
one half of GBS belongs to the Oscar
Wilde period. I have an uncomfortable
premonition that this is the half that
might outlive the other.

It is increasingly evident that, in Thelo-
nious Monk, jazz has its third major
composer: three previously unrecorded
tunes on “It's Monk’s Time” add to a
body of writing comparable to that of
Morton and approaching that of Elling-
ton. < Although poles apart stylistically,
there is also something of these two
pianist-composers in his piano playing.
In both his writing and playing, Monk
preserves jazz essentials to a greater ex-
tent than most of the modernists, at the
same time pushing harmonic and rhyth-
mic innovations as far and further than
the fashion followers.
“Stuffy Turkey” is a prancing, swing-
era riff which depends mainly on inter-
pretation for its subtleties. This piece
demonstrates the growing rapport be-
tween Monk and his tenor-saxist, Charlie
Rouse, and Monk’s solo is developed with
typically “mad” logic. Of the other two
originals, I prefer the medium-tempo
“Brake's Sake” on which Rouse endea-
vors to emulate his leader's eccentricity
with varying success, but “Shuffle Boil”
has its own vinegary fascination.
While appreciative of Miles Davis’
trumpet technique, his improvisational
ability, and the ripples he will undoubt-
edly leave on the main stream of jazz,
all this is nullified for me by his unplea-
sant tone, his pretentiousness and the
"Where are the snows of yester-
year?"

gloom-ridden ugliness of much of his
music. Nothing happens to change my
opinion in these five performances which
were recorded live at the Antibes Inter-
national Jazz Festival. Take a typical
solo on “All of You”; there are occa-
sional lyrical passages but they are inter-
spersed with disjointed mutterings, mean-
ingless chromatic runs, angry staccato
phrases, rooster-crows, pig squeals and
other animalistic noises. The fast
“Walkin’ ” and Davis’ own “Milestones”
are little more than exhibitions of tech-
nique and a cool “Autumn Leaves” left
me shivering.
Another gloom merchant in a different
field is Bob Dylan, a 21-year-old Ameri-
can folk-artist who looks and, reputedly,
lives like a character from a Kerouac
novel. With two exceptions, all the songs
on “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan” are
his own compositions. The best of them
—particularly “Blowin’ in the Wind” and
“Don’t Think Twice”—are simple but
have unusual melodic twists and lyrics
which show a youthful and pessimistic
concern for the state of the world.
But folk music, like jazz, is completely
dependent on performance and it is un-
fortunate that Dylan chooses to sing his
own songs or anyone else’s; he has a
raw, blurred delivery which (if one didn’t
know he was serious) could easily be
taken as a Sellers send-up of the whole
cult. With the present interest in folk
music, it amazes me that the recording
companies don’t issue more authentic
Negro blues singing instead of anaemic
imitations like this.
On “Amor”, Eydie Gorme collaborates
with the Latin-American Trio Los Pan-
chos to present a dozen popular Spanish
songs, some familiar like “Cuanda Vue-
loa a Tu Lado” (“What a Difference a
Day Made”), but mostly recent and new
to my ears. Almost every number is in
bolero rhythm and this, coupled with the
easy professionalism of the performances,
tends to have a soporific effect if the en-
tire album is taken at a sitting; but Miss
Gorme and her polished accompanying
unit make pleasant, if predictable, listen-
ing.
The appeal of these new recordings of
the songs from the twenty-year-old
“Oklahoma!” and the thirteen-year-old
“The King and I” is largely nostalgic;
but, musically speaking, they contain very
acceptable versions of the main numbers,
all ably re-orchestrated by Philip Lang.
The main parts in “The King and I” are
sung by Barbara Cook, Jeanette Scovotti
and Theodore Bikel, and in “Oklahoma!”
by John Raitt and Florence Henderson.
During the ’twenties, Louis Armstrong, in
a series of recordings with his Hot Five
and Hot Seven, developed a solo style
that changed the course of jazz. In the
’thirties, his trumpet playing reached
virtuoso proportions and, simultaneous
with this, was the discovery of his talent
for singing and clowning. This combi-
nation of artistry and showmanship made
him star material and from then until the
formation of the All Stars in 1947, he
was usually presented as a featured solo-
ist and entertainer with the backing of
a big band, often of doubtful quality.
In 1956, with an augmented All Stars,
Armstrong recorded his musical “auto-
biography” in a four-record set. The pre-
sent album is a reissue of that portion
of the autobiography which covers the
years 1930 to 1934, a period when Louis
took the “pop” songs of the day and,
with his uniquely ironic interpretations,
established them as standards of the jazz
repertoire. Perennials like “If I Could
Be With You”, “Memories of You”,
“Them There Eyes”, “You Rascal, You”,
“On the Sunny Side of the Street”, and
Carmichael’s “Georgia” and “Lazy
River” are given definite treatment with
Armstrong's warmth and vitality coming
through as always. The throaty clarinet
of Edmond Hall and Trummy Young’s
exuberant trombone add considerably to
the excitement.
It may be pure nostalgia, but, in spite
of the improved recording and accom-
paniment, I find myself preferring the
originals with all their imperfections.
But this, I feel sure, is a feeling only
likely to be shared by others who grew
up with the older versions.
Of the two “pop” singers, I much
prefer the Country and Western boy,
Jimmie Rodgers; at least, in “The World
I Used to Know”, his material (mostly
folk songs) is attractive and his “blue-
grass” voice not unpleasant. “The Ex-
citing Sounds of Roy Orbison” would be
more aptly titled “The Nauseating Sounds
of Roy Orbison”; as far as I’m concerned,
he has reached Rock bottom.

MUSIC
Genius of Song
Song Recital. Gerard Souzay. Recently at
Sydney Town Hall.
Everyone knows that both the words and
music of a song have to be treated with
the utmost respect by performers,
although in practice singers often find
themselves having to treat one or the
other as paramount. What sets Gerard
Souzay apart is the way he resolutely
satisfies both musical and literary de-
mands —by avoiding all expressive de-
vices that are not strictly warranted by
both words and musical texture and by
making the vocal line itself the main
medium of expression.
Schubert's setting of “Hark! Hark! the
Lark” presents awkward problems for the
performer in its treatment of the words
“hark!” and “arise!”, both of which
demand to be sung as ejaculations, but
usually upset the continuity of the music
if treated in this way. In a recent Sydney


recital, Souzay met this problem by
singing the former word rather staccato,
with heavy emphasis and careful enunci-
ation, but without any increase in volume
or blurring of pitch, while the latter word
was performed in such a way as to make
the leap in pitch from one syllable to the
next carry the whole burden of expres-
sion.
Attention to innumerable such details,
when combined with Souzay’s superb
but unobtrusive technique, made this
recital particularly noteworthy.

The Mavis Bramston Show. Channel 7,

Movies. Channel 7 and Channel 9, Sydney.
The first Mavis Bramston Show, with all
its faults, had hints of wit and sophisti-
cation, and the promise of developing
into something pretty good once it had
settled down. Unfortunately the settling
down process seems to have shaken out
all the wit and promise.
Even the studio laughter—-which I at
first assumed was recorded, but turns
out to have emanated from real people—
has become subdued and tentative. The
only big laugh in a recent show came
from a song about the mounted police-
man's horse which when controlling
traffic “shoves his rump into a lady’s
face”. The word rump is always good
for a big laugh.
The show relies even more on name-
dropping for its effects. The Prime
Minister, the Governor-General and
President Johnson are apt to be men-
tioned, and of course the poor old Chev-
ron: the show even delves into the past
with references to Thommo’s and Chris-
tine Keeler.
The stars Gordon Chater, Barry Crey-
ton and Carol Raye sometimes manage
to give a momentary impression of
smartness to their mediocre material.
But their increasing air of smug, smiling
self-satisfaction is rather exasperating,
considering its lack of apparent cause.
Old movies, once shown on television
at peculiar times when practically no-
body was watching, now get prime time.
Channel 7 is showing a remarkable series
on Saturdays, starting with “All Quiet
on the Western Front”, and continuing
with “Viva Villa”, “The Champ”, “Ah,
Wilderness” and Lubitsch's “The Lady
Dances’’, among others. It was fascina-
ting to see the first of these, in which
Lewis Milestone's direction of the battle
scenes was far more eloquent than the
solemn, pacifist-pamphlet dialogue. Chan-
nel 9 on Wednesdays has an equally
interesting series of musicals, including
“Sun Valley Serenade”.

A Little Nightmusic
Night fills our window, and the shadowline
Glides fluently across the nations of
Eucalvpt. cherry and eternal pine,
Investing Asia with a sombre love
As Pope saw dullness flooding all the West
And conquering with a yawn. The skies above
Our steeply canted roof
Suffer the gale’s reproof.
Those black flocks harried with a hunter’s zest.
Night is the coming of a counterpoint
Whose turbulence will bring the gift of sleep
Gravely to all whose world is out of joint;
From corridors of power to phantom sheep
They sink down through the evening, hour by hour.
The trumpets throb, the violins flow deep,
Crescendoes of cold air
Rise through the she-oaks’ hair
And muted themes vibrate from flower to flower.
Within the magic circle all is still:
The fat books grip their riches, rank on rank;
Those heresies are held and do not spill
(Threatening, unaccommodated, dank)
To violate a place of gathered calm
By thrusting paranoid or mountebank
Into the orderly
Minute society
Where we have shaped the laurel and the palm.
With moderation we have pruned the apple,
Cut back the spiny triumph of the rose
To build a garden’s variegated chapel
For green communion when the salt wind blows.
The prayers that daylight wafts upon the air
Or twists into the “garlands of repose”
Resist a power that must
Powder the world to dust:
We stitch a leafy apron against care.
Darling, I do not know where we are going
Nor on what trade-wind we have journeyed here—
Traversing the dark waters, blowing, blowing—
But we are not true gardeners, I fear;
Nor are we damned, but in this cul-de-sac
Where furniture is soft and lights are clear
We sit becalmed together
Until the crazy weather
Shall drive us out again upon its track.
CHRIS WALLACE-CRABBE
Time
Over the fabric of morning
Time with a valet’s air
Attends on the dreamer awaking
Hands him his joy and his care.
Chooses his clothes for the journey
And bending with votive grace
Watches the river of minutes
Design the flow of his face.
Games with the dreamer at evening
At tables of life and death
And folds as the night encloses
The garments of his breath.
Then stands till towering moonlight
Speaks to the whitewashed wall
Till the river has run where the bone
Is whitest of them all.
LOLA JACKSON
Twentieth Century Cavalier Conceit
Should I outlive my sweethearts 1 shall go
And husband them with memory where they sleep,
And kneel and mourn them secretly to know
If my caresses in their arms still keep;
If in their blue or dark or hazel eyes,
So closed to lustre, images abide
Of me and in their mind all love’s surmise
Made bright before the days our loving died;
If on their lips, as vacant as dried flowers,
And in their folded hands faint shadows lie
Of my devotions offered in those hours
And in their silence all my ecstasy.
DAVID ROWBOTHAM
Malediction
Now is the time to deny the old loves.
Cast out the loves grown cold and bitter.
And, by these words, I mean to end this love
Between us two, for love of word.
Blows, once given, bruised only fragile skin,
But blow by blow each word wounds mortally.
Invoke the words, returning wound for wound.
Words burn, words be my executioner.
For her I held an image in my heart.
I mean to smash the image with these words.
Her name, transformed, becomes another
Row of letters in my alphabet of hate.
Exorcised by this incantation she lies
Buried beneath the words of this poem.
KEITH VINCENT SMITH
Infidelity
I could not bear
not in that unsustaining o
Your brutal absence, so I made,
Breathless and afraid,
A sort of image of you.
I didn’t think you’d care
That for a moment she was passing fair,
Or dare to believe that I would dare.
T. H. JONES
Adrift
Over there there are timid coasts
And the tamed land behind.
I walk the sea with ghosts.
Even the sun is brave
Over the tumble and haste
Of my populous grave.
I shun the foreign land,
Content to share the waves
With the ghosts I understand.
Companioned so by ghosts
I ride this burial sea
Away from the living coasts.
And so remain dumbfound
With the sound of the sea, and the sea
Of the sound I sound.

BOOKS
China after Khrushchev
by ALICE ERH-SOON TAY
Tsars, Mandarins, and Commissars: A His-
tory of Chinese-Russian Relations. Harry
Schwartz. Gollancz. 365.
Since China’s explosion of a nuclear
device and the political burial of Mr
Khrushchev, a renewed question-mark
hangs over the Sino-Soviet dispute. Just
as the world had become convinced that
the mounting exchange of denunciations
between Khrushchev and Mao was cer-
tainly no confidence trick to divide
and confuse the West, but a deep-seated
and genuine breach, Khrushchev fell. Did
he fall because of his vulgarity and self-
importance, because of his domestic
failures, or because he believed in “peace-
ful co-existence” sufficiently to reduce
defence expenditures? Above all, did he
fall —as some journalists have suggested
—to pave the way for a reconciliation
with China?
Harry Schwartz’s book on Chinese-
Russian relations was printed and bound
before these disturbing events occurred
and before these still unresolved ques-
tions arose. If the late President Ken-
nedy had been right in January, 1963,
when he said that the dispute between
Russia and China was merely “a dispute
over how best to bury the Free World”,
Mr Schwartz’s book would now have
lost all practical point. In a dispute over
means, not ends, even a partial change of
leadership can be enough to bring about
agreement.
Mr Schwartz’s book, however, has not
lost its point because he believes that the
dispute goes far deeper than mere per-
sdnalities or even disagreement about
means. “At the heart of the struggle be-
tween Russia and China,” he writes, “is
Lenin’s old but fundamental question,
‘ktokovo’, which in this context may be
translated as ‘who shall rule whom?’
Shall Russia dictate to China or China
to Russia? Shall Communism be, as in
Stalin’s time, an instrument of Russian
imperial policy or of Chinese imperial
policy?”
“The banner of ideology,” President
de Gaulle said last year, “in reality covers
only ambitions.” In a Chatham House
essay recently reviewed in these pages
(“The Chinese View of their Place in the
World”), Professor C. P. Fitzgerald sug-
gested that beneath the facade of Chinese
Communism lay the hard brickwork of
Chinese ethnocentricity. Mr Schwartz,
Moscow correspondent of the “New
York Times” and a former academic
specialising on the Soviet economy,
comes at the problem in a similar way,
but predominantly from the Russian side.
Beneath the Sino-Soviet war of words lies
the hard fact that Russia, since Peter the
Great, has consistently coveted what is
or could be China’s.
Much of this book, then, is (rather
journalistic) history: the story of three
centuries of contact and conflict between
Russian and Chinese expansion in Asia.
Mr Schwartz traces intrigue and counter-
intrigue over Sinkiang, Outer Mongolia
and the Amur-Argun-Ussuri region of
the Far East, beginning in the 17th cen-
tury and culminating in the series of
major Russian gains in the 1850 s: “un-
equal treaties” denounced by Peking in
1963, under which Russia and other
European powers gained territorial con-
cessions, trade privileges, railway and
banking concessions, etc. The spirit in
which Russia confronted China in those
centuries, Mr Schwartz rightly points out,
was summarised in a statement of the
1890 s made by one of Rus-
sia's ablest Cabinet Mini-
sters, the Finance Minister
Sergei Witte:
“The more inert countries
in Asia will fall prey to the
powerful invaders and will
be divided up between
them. The problem of each
country concerned is to ob-
tain as large a share as pos-
sible of the inheritance of
the outlived oriental states,
especially of the Chinese
Colossus. Russia, both geo-
graphically and historically, has the un-
disputed right to the lion’s share of the
expected prey . . . The absorption by
Russia of a considerable portion of the
Chinese Empire is only a matter of time.”
But can Stalin’s relations with China
and the Chinese Communists before they
seized power be interpreted as showing
a continuation of the imperialist attitudes
with which an expanding Russian state
confronted the Manchu Empire? It is
well known that Russian Bolshevik ad-
vice to the Communist Party of China in
the 1920 s and 1930 s was almost con-
sistently bad advice. It was only by de-
ciding to act independently that the
Chinese Communists were able to con-
solidate their Party and then to take over
the country. Mr Schwartz sees behind
the Russian advice something more than
mere dogmatic incompetence and lack of
acquaintance with Chinese conditions.
Stalin’s primary interest, he argues, was a
national interest: the existence of a strong
buffer state to halt Japanese expansion
toward Russia. It was in this (Russian)
interest that he wanted the Chinese Com-
munists to maintain the united front and
not threaten the Kuomintang State. And
nowhere, Mr Schwartz argues, was Sta-
lin’s imperialism more evident than at the
Yalta Conference, where Uncle Joe sat
down with the British Lion and Uncle
Sam to carve up the Far East and the
World, without the least reference to
China.
Russia, the Chinese statesman Li
Hung-chang complained in 1896, wanted
“to control us in all our home affairs”,
and this, as Mr Schwartz sees it, is what
Chinese still think today. The mid-
-19505, it is true, saw a high point of
Sino-Soviet friendship, with reciprocal
trade booming, but tension soon again
rose. China began to support claims for
independence for Russia’s East European
satellites and to make extravagant claims
for the Chinese contribution to Marxist
theory and practice. Russia refused to
support China in the border clash with
India, the trade balance worsened and
Soviet technicians were withdrawn at a
time when China desperately needed
help; the secret undertaking to help China
become a nuclear power (revealed by
China last year) was cancel-
led by the Russians. In the
early months of 1963, it is
true, there seemed some
easing of tension, but in
April, 1963, Mr Schwartz
believes, an irreparable
breach was made. Its precise
cause is not known: Mr
Schwartz suggests that the
Chinese came to Moscow
with a price for reconcilia-
tion (probably help in nu-
clear projects) and that the
Soviet Union bluntly re-
jected it. The split in world Communism
became public.
“Tsars, Mandarins, and Commissars” is
a fast-moving, readable book, and it
achieves this by being a one-theme book.
The sudden shifts in Stalin's policy on
China are not satisfactorily explained, and
are not related in any genuine way to
overall Comintern policy and the parallel
vacillations in Europe. The difference in
present-day economic development be-
tween Russia and China is largely
ignored; Mr Schwartz simply does not
ask how much of the present conflict is
the clash between attitudes formed at
different stages of Communist revolution
and forced industrialisation. The reader
will do best to treat Mr Schwartz’s book
as a lucid popular exposition of one
important factor in the Sino-Soviet dis-
pute. Taken together with other factors
—the differences in social conditions and
economic development that mark off
today’s Russia from today's China —the
national interest factor suggests that the
breach is more than one of Khrushchev's
(or Mao's) blunders. The divergences
between Russia and China may be tem-
porarily glossed over or made temporarily


unimportant by more serious common
dangers, but they can hardly be removed
by mere decree. Man, as Marx taught
us, is the slave, and not the master of
societies.

Edward Lear’s Bong tree is the bread-
fruit tree under which James Ullman
eventually finds himself, accepting into
his bones and blood the slow rhythm of
the Islands, during a fourteen - month
journey around the Pacific. He went to
Hawaii, Wake, Guam, Palau, Truk, the
Marshalls, Fiji, much of Polynesia and
back to Los Angeles, travelling in steam-
ships, planes, launches, sailing boats and
a long boat, primarily to escape a
November chill felt one day in a Man-
hattan park.
It is well to know that James Ullman
(a writer of ten novels) was then 51, for
this is a book of matured observations
of the Islands, of reporting which comes
from the eye of experience, from an
American who finds distaste for the en-
croaching commercialism in the lives of
the people of the Pacific dreamland; the
too many tourists and the too many out-
siders moving in to disrupt and tarnish
the lives of Melanesians and Poly-
nesians with know-how, sales and profit.
Ullman met many people on his
journey, carefully scratching the social
surface to expose local opinion. In Suva
he found the hotel very British and full
of “Times” readers, and vulgar tourists.
“The voice of turistus Americanus, as,
draped in luau shirt and three cameras,
he comes down the cruise ship gangway
into Suva’s wharfside market. ‘Wonder
how you make the gooks understand
you,’ he says gloomily to his wife. And
then a few minutes later, with pleased
astonishment: ‘Hey, whaddya know,
Gert they talk English!’ The voice of
turistus Australiensis raised in complaint
at a shop on Victoria Parade: ‘I sye, you
pye more ’ere than back ’ome’. The
clerk —as likely as not an Australian
himself appraises him with jaundiced
eye. ‘Tightest blokes in the world,’ one
of them confided to me. ‘Come on a
ruddy trip with one drip-dry and a five-
pound note’.”
Alastair Reid, a romantic Scot,
humanist and poet, has contributed to
the New Yorker and gained other pres-
tige from his books of poetry, a word
book and books for children. These
latter talents he employs in a disparate
collection of subjects described as “Pass-
words”. As an introduction he has
written Notes On Being a Foreigner in
which he seems to resent the title but
has learned to accept it and probably
would like to have himself officially
described as such in his passport, or
perhaps as “Outsider”, to emphasise his
need for individual expression.
After the mixture of observation,
social analysis and history gained from
Spanish journeys (he was pleased to find
that the Basques “scarcely bother to
mention Franco’s name; their contempt
is cold, silent, final”), we are offered
several Reid lessons on language and
words, the puzzling Z and the odd Q.
His verse, partly connected but mostly
dispersed from the unit theme, his long
study of English Gypsies and his Notes
On Childhood make up the rest of this
strange book which might otherwise be
called Alastair Reid’s Home-Made Satur-
day Book (without pictures) for bored
adolescents.
Victor Gollancz have been very kind
to D. R. Sherman in lengthening a long
short story into a novella by the simple
mechanical process of using a large type
widely spaced on small pages. The
publishers have also made this kind
statement on the jacket: “A first novel by
a writer in his twenties, this is, we think,
a little masterpiece.”
It is a saga of adventure and courage
in which an old Indian gardener, Mali,
and a European boy travel into the track-
less bushland for about a day’s walk in
search of sambur. The adventure is the
boy’s—the old man’s often-repeated tale
of an heroic bear fight, the gift of his
famous bow, the laborious seasoning of
arrow shafts and the trek into the un-
known with the hunter —and extreme
courage is shared by both after the old
man suffers a disastrous accident.
On the journey there is a wonderful
contentment between them and their
relationship is one of happy, comfortable
dependence on one another.
When the father-image responsibilities
are restricted to the delights of bush
lore instruction and rules of manliness,
there is a bond strong enough to with-
stand the terror and anguish of the old
man’s frightful leg injury in a bear trap
and their struggle to return home. Sher-
man eventually attempts the impossible
when he transforms the boy, who should
be no more than about twelve years,
from one of average frailty unable to
carry his bow and quiver of arrows when
supporting the injured Mali, into a super-
boy who is able to carry the old man at
the end of the journey. This kind of
magic does not help to make a “little
masterpiece”.
John Brunner is a young, successful
writer of science fiction stories whose
romantic novel, “The Crutch of
Memory”, turns out to be more like a
travel book about Greece. English boy,
“long-faced, large-eared, black-haired and
brown-eyed . . . developing a rash of
freckles”, in sports car, meets English
girl, “with hair the color of dark honey
. . . skin a little tanned . . . nose tilted
at the tip . . . her shoulders were square
. . . her arms were tapered to slim hands.
All of her was slender; her breasts were
small, her hips were small, and her feet,
thrust in rope-soled sandals, were so
narrow one might think they had been
bound”, carrying a hitch-hiker’s duffle
bag; on the Brindisi ferry. They both
have problems. She, Wendy, a happy,
natural girl is to stay with a Greek
friend, Spiro, whose advances will be
unwelcome, whilst he, Hugh, unhappy,
mixed up and near-impotent, is to stay
with an English actor friend, Toby,
whose advances will be unwelcome. It’s
all done with dexterity.

With the publication of this year’s
“Christie for Christmas” comes the in-
credible news that one of Agatha
Christie’s books has been seized with
view to banning in Capetown. My
advice to Christie addicts is to read “The
Caribbean Mystery” before local authori-
ties discover what hot stuff she is. Mean-
while, I am tipping an investigation of
“Winnie the Pooh” in the near future.
The setting for Miss Christie’s latest
piece of skulduggery is the Golden Palm
Hotel on the island of St Honora and the
guests, of course, .are the suspects—all
of them. Before the story ends there are
three corpses and clues are fairly
paraded to enable the perceptive reader
to establish (pre-denouement) the mur-
derer who, naturally enough in Christie-
land, turns out to be the one person one
feels could not possibly be guilty. Miss
Marples is the dear old spinster-detective
whose only weapon is conversation and
she gently pumps an hotel-full of charac-
ters until she arrives at the seemingly
inevitable solution.
One does not expect thrills from
Agatha Christie (all the murders are
off-stage) but the faultless plotting and
deft story-telling one does expect are in
evidence as usual.
“Soap-opera” has become a damning
and overworked term in literary criticism
and perhaps Howard Spring’s new novel
doesn’t quite deserve it; but, wading
through this rags-to-riches family chro-
nicle, one is continually reminded of
those interminable radio serials from
whence the term derived. Mr Spring is an

established popular novelist and “Winds
of the Day” is a certain best-seller no
matter how it is reviewed, but I found
it hard to reconcile his reputation with
the quality of his writing as exhibited
here.
Left an orphan in Manchester at the
end of Queen Victoria’s reign, Alice
Openshaw becomes a servant girl and
this is the story of her struggles to better
herself, her marriages (two), her family,
and of the many people who become in-
volved in her life. It is what I call a
“vital statistics” novel —concerned mostly
with births, deaths and marriages. Alice’s
gossipy story skips from Manchester to
the coast of Cornwall to London and
back again, unobtrusively indicating as
it unfurls the changes that have occurred
in English life and outlook during the
past fifty years, but set down so apathe-
tically that one feels that the author has
covered this ground once too often.
If all a bit unreal and reminiscent of
the Victorian novel, Mr Spring’s melli-
fluous, leisurely style has a quiet charm
that will bring comfort to his established
audience and stir the memories of older
readers.
Although equally chatty, “Kate and
Emma” is much more vigorous and real.
Monica Dickens, like her great-grand-
father, writes with honesty about the
seamier side of London life, relieving
its grimness with flashes of earthy humor.
She, too, exposes social evils in a pain-
less way and has a talent for authentic
atmospheric detail. If “Kate and
Emma” is at all typical of her books,
she is a writer of far more substance
than I had previously imagined.
The novel opens in a Juvenile Court
in London. Kate is one of the young
offenders and Emma is the magistrate’s
daughter, there because of her experi-
ences with the “Cruelty Man”, a social
worker who investigates the mistreat-
ment of children. Between the girls, in
defiance of their backgrounds, a rather
unlikely friendship develops, giving the
author the opportunity of exploring and
comparing two very different social
levels.
Emma has her own problems (her
parents’ broken marriage, her involve-
ment with a married man, and another
unsatisfactory love affair) but they are
trifling compared with Kate’s. The girls
grow apart as Emma’s horizon widens
and Kate’s gets inevitably narrower, but
Emma sticks by Kate when she is accused
of gross cruelty to one of her own un-
wanted brats. From her association
with Kate’s world, Emma learns that
poverty is a disease which can disfigure
and that children are all too frequently
the victims of the bitterness and despair
of people chained together in unsuccess-
ful marriages.

An elderly woman sat reading a novel in
a railway carriage. Little did she suspect
that its illustrious author was furtively
watching from the opposite seat. Signor
Silone says little about her reaction in
his preface, but as he decided to revise
the book we may draw our own con-
clusions.
It is hard to believe the woman would
be much impressed with the labor she in-
spired. “Bread and Wine” (the author
changed his title from “Pane e Vino” to
“Vino e Pane”—“l have the impression
that in the new version wine plays a
larger role than bread” —but the transla-
tor rightly ignores this quibbling re-
arrangement) was first published in 1937.
In rewriting it in 1962, Silone has re-
moved “secondary elements and affairs of
only contemporary concern” in order to
give the “fundamental theme” greater
prominence.
This theme is, to use the novel’s own
words, how a man “comes painfully to
an awareness of his own humanity”.
Almost as important is the investigation
of deplorable conditions among Italian
peasants during the Fascist regime, due
as much to the stupidity and apathy of
the people themselves as to the corrup-
tion of the government.
The subject matter is worthy, but the
approach is too didactic. Furthermore,
the style and narrative technique lack
vigor. I suspect the author has robbed
it of much of its youthful bite in this
revision, the “exaggeration, sarcasm and
melodrama” he eschews in favor of “calm
narration”. “As for style,” he claims,
“the supreme wisdom in story-telling is
to try to be simple.” He has succeeded
only too well. His story is so simple, so
calm, it fails to leave an impression.
An exiled Italian Communist revisits
his native land, disguised as a priest. Suf-
fering with a disease of the lungs, he
hopes to recuperate in a little village near
his home town, but finds that most of his
energy is spent in avoiding the exercise
of priestly duties. In one of his awkward
experiences a peasant girl suspects that
he may be Christ, but his lack of stig-
mata disqualifies him for the rank—to
the relief of one and all. He is, she then
decides, only a saint.
When he is somewhat recovered he
re-establishes contact with his leaders.
But in his absence official Communism
has degenerated into a variation of
Fascism—“red Fascism” as Silone calls
it. His ideas already shaken by contact
with the peasants, this comes as a telling
blow. However, a meeting with his
old teacher and one with a young man
who is later tortured to death by the
police finally restore his faith.
In the meantime he has fallen in love,
but dares not reveal to the girl his dis-
guise. The obscurely motivated ending
has her following him into a snowstorm
and being eaten by symbolic wolves.
“With the passage of years I have de-
veloped a repugnance for every form of
propaganda.” Even in the light of
“Bread and Wine” this statement sounds
rather dishonest. “The School for Dic-
tators”, also written before the war and
now revised, is a straightforward political
tract. It takes the form of a three-sided
discussion between a would-be American
dictator, his PR man and yet another
Italian exile who is engaged to help him
learn the art of dictatorship.
Heavy-handed irony, intended for the
defence of democracy, does little to make
this tedious book readable. There was
little risk, I should say, of the author’s
running into anyone reading it on a train.
Silone apparently has a considerable
reputation in Europe. I find little to
justify it in either of these novels; and
while his view that “a book, once pub-
lished, no longer belongs to the author,
but to the public” is surely fanciful, he
was right to question the value of revising
them. The results prove it was mere
self-indulgence.

A Test of Critics
Henry James and tlie Modern Reader. D. W.
Jefferson. Oliver and Boyd. 58s.
D. W. Jefferson is an Englishman and
so escapes some of the conflicts that
beset American critics of James, and he
sets out with the aim not of “placing”
James, or offering a fresh interpretation
of his major themes, but with the more
modest, and wholly admirable, wish to
persuade the modern reader that the
alleged “difficulties” in the novels of
Henry James are not as great as some
of the more portentous criticism of his
work would lead us to suppose, and to
offer an introduction, a guide to the
pleasures in reading Henry James. In his
opening chapters he sets out to correct
two misapprehensions, as he sees them,
which the extent and seriousness of
James criticism may lead to. The first he
calls “a question of tone”. Granting the
tremendous influence on modern criticism
of the technical comments on the novel
involved in James's prefaces to the New
York edition of his work, he insists on
the general buoyancy of tone and exuber-
ance of manner in these prefaces.
The second view of James which
Jefferson wishes to correct is that which
insists on the moral concerns of the
novels to the detriment of their value as
novels. Of course James has a moral
view, and of course the predicaments of
his characters raise moral issues, but
again it is a matter of emphasis. James
creates complex people who respond as
moral beings to the situations in which
they are presented, but to impose a too-
rigid moral schematism on the novels is
dangerously to distort them.
In a book designed principally for
English, or at least non-American, read-
ers it is right to insist on the American-
ness of Henry James. James’ early work
as a writer of travel sketches was in an
established tradition of American letters.
The acuteness, the freshness of observa-
tion in his descriptions of London or
Paris or Rome or other European scenes
are, to a degree, those of a tourist. Many
of the major characters in his novels are
in fact tourists seeing Europe and
responding to its society with an energy
and freshness that would not be possible
to a native born. These characters,
whether they are tired businessmen like
Waymarsh in “The Ambassadors” who
sees Europe simply as a place where the
overworked American can take a holiday,
or idealists like Strether in the same
book, who finds a sense of release and
new possibility, are all involved with the
European scene in a way that allows it
to appear fresh and new. James is more
aware of the inwardness of his Ameri-
can characters; his Europeans and Eng-
lish are apt to be admired rather as exhi-
bition specimens. To put it grotesquely,
they are apt to be judged like pedigree
dogs, not by their intrinsic merits but by
their possession of certain admired—and
arbitrarily admired—characteristics.
In his discussion of James’ method
Jefferson points out that the celebrated
use of “centres of consciousness” is less
radical than is sometimes claimed. The
omniscient narrator is very often there in
the background, interpreting, pointing
and illuminating the observations and
responses of the character.
The final chapters of “Henry James
and the Modern Reader” contain critical
discussions of some of the best short
stories and the later novels. These are
intelligent and illuminating, and
thoroughly justify the ground-clearing
discussions of the earlier sections of the
book. The modern reader coming to
D. W. Jefferson’s book without a know-
ledge of a good deal of Henry James’s
work may sometimes be confused or left
behind by the particularity of the refer-
ence and discussion. On the other hand,
he will certainly be encouraged to read
Henry James, and instructed in how to
get the greatest pleasure from that read-
ing.

Mata Hari’s Daughter
Indo. Emily Hahn. Weidenfeld and Nicol-
son. 235.
The Eyes of Reason. Stefan Heym. Seven
Seas, Berlin. Bs. 6d.
The durable Emily Hahn has written a
not very good novel on a crucial subject:
Indonesia. Her Eurasian heroine, fresh
out of Holland, believes herself to be
the daughter of Mata Hari and morally
obligated to return to the country that
so delighted the infamous spy.
Beautiful, young Julie de Jong comes
to Java in 1939 and spends the next years
torn between her mother’s European
and her father’s Indonesian heritage in
the inevitable conflict of every Eurasian.
Feeling Dutch, she dislikes the Japanese
who come to “liberate” Indonesia and
she questions the validity of her Indone-
sian lover’s claim to an independent
Indonesia.
Her mother’s blood leads her into
situations where she is forced to spy on
a man she likes and admires, although
he is the enemy. For convenience’s sake,
she becomes the mistress of another
enemy, with her Indonesian lover’s con-
sent, if not his approval. Her European
lover, an American caught up in Dutch
island affairs, proposes marriage to her
after four years in a Djakarta intern-
ment camp which is what her Indonesian
lover has been offering her all along. She
makes her choice between them.
Beautiful, exotic Julie’s confused and
swerving loyalties are played out against
a background even more confusing. The
“liberated” Javanese turn on their Japa-
nese liberators. They find they have
exchanged one conqueror for another,
and of the two the Dutch brought greater
prosperity and better manners. They
rally behind a leader preaching inde-
pendence, a fiery orator called Soekarno.
They are genuinely convinced revolu-
tion and resulting independence will
bring them good government and the
same degree of affluence the Dutch crea-
ted, but with their own hands, rather
than Dutch hands, in the till.
The story ends with the cessation of
hostilities after Hiroshima. Emily Hahn
doesn’t miss the chance to imply that
even at that time the Indonesians were
speculating on help from the Americans
to implement their independence and
then . . . back to dicker with the Dutch
if prosperity doesn’t come fast enough,
although certain leaders favor dealing
with the Communists instead.
Herr Heym’s book consists of two
novels in regrettably small type, origin-
ally published in 1951, dealing with the
events leading up to the Communist take-
over of the Czech Government in 1948.
The three Benda brothers, competent
men in their thirties, with their wives and
intimates, link the narratives. Joseph,
the eldest, has inherited the family’s
glassworks—perhaps a symbol as well as
a leading Czech industry—of which he
becomes manager when these are nationa-
lised, always hoping and scheming to
again put them under his personal owner-
ship. The second brother is a doctor who
has survived Buchenwald and the young-
est of the trio, Thomas, is a writer and
war-time “Spokesman for Czechoslova-
kia” while in the States drumming up
both propaganda and dollars for the
Czech cause.
The first novel meticulously depicts the
alignment of these men, their wives, mis-
tresses and associates, in a time of politi-
cal and economic change. The second,
largely through the writings of brother
Thomas who quotes aptly from Thomas
Masaryk and Heinrich Heine, poses a
question foreign today to Australians but
familiar throughout Europe since iron
replaced Stone Age clubs: What is free-
dom? And from a contemplation of this,
corollary questions arise: In what does
it consist? What are its demands and
responsibilities? How is it correctly
applied? The author uses his characters
as living illustrations of the multiple
facets of freedom-seeking.
Perhaps the most sobering reminder
this novel offers is the lengthy (and even
smaller-type) quotation from the political
prophet and German-Jewish poet Hein-
rich Heine, whose logic led him so infal-
libly to predict the rising power of Com-
munism during these past 100 years and
its increasing influence on social free-
doms, economics, poetry and “the whole
romantic world”. Heym is on the Heine
track: the search for the integration of
art and life, which should be natural to
any sensitive, thinking human being, and
is far from it.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Pressure on Brokerage
The proposal for a national Stock Exchange located
in Canberra has led to a guessing game as to who
is behind it and, although the banks have denied all
knowledge of the shy proposer, it is obvious that institu-
tional support is necessary if the plan is to succeed.
Many people have taken as a clue to identity the
suggestion that unit trusts and mutual funds should be
included for membership of the new Exchange, “as best
fitted to establish the facilities necessary for transmitting
client investment instructions to the trading floor of the
Exchange”. Other suggested members are banks, insurance
and trustee companies, merchant banks and pastoral
companies.
The curious part about the proposal is that it is not
suggested that members should deal with each other in
share dealings, which is the most obvious advantage for
institutions to save brokerage and stamp duty. In fact, no
employee of a member would be permitted to act on the
Exchange. Special brokers would be appointed who would
never act as principals, take positions on their own account,
match orders in their own books, or accept directorships
in any Australian listed public company.
The big attraction for the public is the claim that not
more than 1 p.c. (buying or selling) will be charged on
share deals. But this 1 p.c. is split three ways among the
Exchange (clearing costs), the member (handling charges)
and the broker.
Because the Exchange would provide all the facilities
for registration of documents (and is located in Canberra),
the conclusion is that the new system will eliminate stamp
duty. Everyone cheers except the State Stamp Duties
Commissioners, but they certainly will not take this loss
of revenue calmly.
The 1 p.c. charge also becomes very cheap on small
transactions compared with current brokerage of 4.16 p.c.
on ss. and 8.3 p.c. on Is. (before stamp duty). If the
banks are involved, they certainly do not want to be caught
with heavy administrative costs. Already their charges for
the handling of securities are uneconomic on small trans-
actions. One leading bank recently lifted its nominee
service charges by 25 p.c. Also, if overseas experience is
a guide, domination by the banks and institutions in the
securities market would affect a free market.
There is no doubt that an institutionally-backed Stock
Exchange could send the present brokerage system to the
wall. But, once having established an exclusive national
market of its own, charges could be raised and the inevit-
able development of overseas practices would require the
establishment of a Securities and Exchange Commission
to protect the public.
The proposal has benefited investors already by
emphasising the need for lower brokerage rates. It is
understood the Associated Stock Exchanges currently have
under consideration a plan to eliminate double brokerage
on short-term buying and selling transactions. Perhaps
the threat of a new Exchange will promote faster
consideration.
Tea for More Than Two
/Consumption of tea per head is falling in Australia and
the Tea Council of Australia proposes to do some-
thing about it.
The Ceylon Tea Bureau plans to spend £183,000 on
promotion in 1965, including a £40,000 subscription to
the Tea Council of Australia. The Council also will obtain
£40,000 from Australian tea firms and £20,000 from India.
Bushells may even recommend tea with a coffee chaser.
Aim of the promotion campaign is to convince Aus-
tralians they should consume more than the six lb. per
head they drink annually.
Reason for the burst of activity is that coffee producers
have been promoting more actively, so that the tea
producers with an £8 million Australian turnover to
protect think that they had better get into the act.
Australia is an important market for Ceylon and India
because it is the third largest consumer of tea in the world,
ranking after the UK and the USA.
Defence by Growth
A Sydney sharebroker has published a circular which
claims that Australia should not suffer any undue
disturbance over the proposed £ 1200 m. three-year defence
commitments because Australia presently spends about
3 p.c. of its Gross National Product (at factor cost) com-
pared with a peak wartime figure of 40 p.c.
The proposed expenditure on defence will rise to only
4.1 p.c. of GNP by 1967-68, if GNP grows at the rate of
6 p.c. per qnnum. The argument is used that this should
not represent any great hardship because tax income also
will increase.
If contained within the estimated 4.1 percentage, Aus-
tralia’s commitment seems small compared with the UK
equivalent of 6.6 p.c. and the US expenditure of 11.5 p.c.
There are other aspects to consider, however. Japan,
which is a major trade competitor, is claimed to be spend-
ing only 1.4 p.c. of GNP on defence and, aided by
American investment (including a two billion dollar post-
war loan), has been able to achieve one of the fastest
growing economies in the world.
A recent review by “The Economist” shows that Japan
maintained an annual growth of 9.1 p.c. in the five years

to 1955 and an annual growth of 10 p.c. in the five years
to 1960, at a time when Britain’s growth dropped from
2.6 p.c. to 2.4 p.c.
This remarkable growth by Japan outstripped Germany’s
much-publicised growth of 9 p.c. per annum in the five
years to 1955 and 6 p.c. per annum in the five years to
1960. By saving on defence, and thus conserving man-
power, Japan has been able to add at least 2 percentage
points to its growth rate.
Against this background, the inevitable conclusion is
that Australia’s growth must be slowed by its defence
commitments, yet a major competitor, backed by the US,
is free to continue its amazing growth rate, subject only
to a voluntary deflation policy by a Government which
may consider that expansion has been too rapid.
This is an over-simplication, of course, and it does not
present a full picture. Japan has been careful to see that
its balance of payments remains under control. It has also
achieved a remarkable record of having its population
save 20 p.c. of personal, disposable incomes.
Part of this fortunate internal liquidity can be attributed
to an annual trend to curb unnecessary spending, while at
the same time encourage the tourists to spend heavily, as
witnessed by the fact that Tokyo is as expensive a place
to visit as any US city.
Although the agricultural industries have been denuded
of labor to feed a rapidly expanding industrial machine,
the wage structure has kept pace with the inevitable change
in living standards which accompanies such a trans-
formation. In fact, the gradual increase in living standards
is very obvious and Japan also is facing the problems of
wage demands.
US aid, plus ready access to overseas royalties, has
enabled Japan in many cases to improve on other people’s
technologies, yet produce at a better price.
Had Japan been forced to spend huge sums in research
and in defence, she would not have enjoyed such
tremendous growth. This has not been achieved without a
slow rate of progress in hous-
ing and public works like
roads, education and hospitals,
which is an ironic reminder to
Australia if criticisms are
taken to heart over New
Guinea development (where
the World Bank survey team
said Australia had developed
hospitals and education on a
level with “developed” econo-
mies in Europe).
Australia’s increased de-
fence commitments may be
argued away under the pros-
pect of increased tax revenue.
But higher tax revenue is a
normal growth and is expec-
ted to take care of a corres-
ponding increase in annual ex-
penditure to keep pace with
an expanding economy.
A setback to tax revenue,
influenced by a loss of over-
seas markets and reduction of
profit margins because of in-
creased imports, could force a
revision of figures to a stage
where defence expenditure ex-
ceeds 4 p.c. of GNP and the
Government is forced to
borrow heavily.
"That was a bob-a-job week, when the Boy
Scouts took over!"
Taping the Territories
lyiucH of the programme set forth in the World Bank’s
report on the economic development of Papua and
New Guinea should speedily become the common coin
of discussion throughout Australia, instead of remaining
the under-cover preserve of officialdom. Once again, of
course, it is a pity that this kind of extended survey has
not been tackled, and published, by some Australian team,
either of academics or departmental experts.
Then, however, the general principles determining, and
emerging from, a report may well have been wholly
different. For one attitude does speak very plainly through
the Bank mission’s detailed examination. It has neatly
planted a packed economic mine beneath the doctrine of
uniform development for indigenes, which so largely con-
ditions the Federal Government’s approach to leading the
territories towards self- government.
Another gage thrown down to traditional policy is the
mission’s assertion of the necessity for stronger planning
(a resource, by the way, that the Government seems loath
to adopt on the mainland). The line suggested for Papua-
New Guinea appears clearly: “Economic planning should
cover both the long and short term. An annual plan, as
the basis for the annual budget, and a plan covering a
longer period, of about five years, should be prepared. The
plans should be published both as an indication of govern-
ment intent and as a guide to the private sector.”
Public comment since publication of the report seems
mostly to have centred around the increased financial
assistance taken for granted by the mission. The projected
figure of £50.2 million a year for the next five years cer-
tainly requires fuller establishment. Nevertheless, levels of
this order, presumably to be financed entirely within Aus-
tralia and the territories, show what outside world opinion
demands from Australian-guided effort.
In spite of the impressive statistical background furnished
to support various sector programmes, the possible man-
power strains of the proposed
new era are not completely
faced. Some hindrances are
naturally realised: “The prime
limitation has been the avail-
ability of skilled manpower
which will have to come
mainly from Australia.”
Such limitations look even
more crucial, especially where
skilled labor is concerned, in
the light of present strains
afflicting the Australian
economy. The mission force-
fully warns, though, “against
an across - the - board policy
which distributes scarce man-
power and finance throughout
the Territory without due re-
gard to the benefits to be
derived in comparison with
those realisable elsewhere”.
Here, also, it gives nodding
recognition to “political fac-
tors.”
The report puts a good deal
of emphasis upon the “selec-
tion of standards suitable to
the Territory”—a criterion to
measure the quicker possibility
of achieving financial viability.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
A Record Year for Industry
Now, where do we go from here?
rpHis has been a great year for Aus-
tralian manufacturing industries.
With the labor force fully employed and
manufacturing taking something like half
the addition to it, with investment in
plant and equipment at record levels, it
goes without saying that output has been
considerably higher than in any previous
year.
We have to thank this rise in output
probably more than any other single
factor for holding back the rise in con-
sumer prices to moderate levels, albeit
this year being economically notable also
for the first breach in price stability after
three years of virtual stability. While
prices have risen by about 2 p.c., there
are as yet no patent signs that the in-
crease has got out of hand. While the
manufacturers have kept filling the pipe-
lines, these have also been assisted by
record production of raw materials and
commodities and by rising imports, which
the strength of overseas reserves, but-
tressed both by continued high exports
and capital inflow, have allowed us to re-
gard with reasonable equanimity.
If we are entitled to view the year’s
industrial performance with high satis-
faction, we still have to take note of the
record in statistical terms not only
overall but also for the pattern that has
emerged in production. The obvious
question then becomes: where do we go
from here? The figures themselves are
revealing. So are some of the observa-
tions on them, particularly from the
economic departments of the private
banks.
the official figures, we
look like finishing the year with an
increase of between 8 and 9 p.c. in Gross
National Product measured at market
prices. For the first three-quarters of the
year the rise was 8.8 p.c. on this basis.
Imports rose by 17.2 p.c. on the like
period 1963. Adding GNP to imports
this gives us an increase of just under
10 p.c. in national turnover of goods and
services for the nine months. This is a
measure of the increase in the total flow
of goods acting as a buffer to the rise in
disposable incomes over the period. So
much for the official figures gleaned from
the latest quarterly estimates of National
Income and Expenditure.
Against this it must be frankly admit-
ted that the production performance in
October, which was of course affected
by the GM-H strike, was disappointing,
in that more than half the industries sur-
veyed by the Statistician registered re-
duced outputs compared with September.
In a lot of cases, notably in durable
consumption goods, woollen textiles and
tobacco, production was even lower than
in the previous October. The decline fits
in with the increase of 2,328 in un-
employment during the month, but the
latter would not nearly explain it. It
might be that industrial production has
begun to taper off.
The fact that imports, which have
threatened to run away in recent months
(they reached a new record of £123.1
million in October), dropped back to a
still high but more reasonable level of
£116.8 million in November may be an
oblique reflection of this, though the evi-
dence from that quarter is by no means
conclusive, as subsequent monthly figures
may well show.
More positive evidence, perhaps,
G. c. HILL
Chief Manager of the National Bank
comes from the Bank of New South
Wales and Associated Chambers of
Manufactures’ survey of industrial trends
conducted in the first two weeks of Nov-
ember. For the first time since the sur-
veys were started in 1960 (they are con-
ducted at four monthly intervals), a
majority 59 p.c. of the respondents
said they believed the business situation
would remain substantially unchanged in
the ensuing six months. Only 34 p.c. of
them, compared with 54 p.c. in July and
69 p.c. in March, believed an improve-
ment would take place and the percent-
age expecting a worsening rose slightly
to 7 p.c.
The survey also found that forecasts
by manufacturers of their companies’ per-
formance for the next four months were
more restrained than those expressed in
July. A higher proportion of them than
usual expected little change. Even so, the
survey pointed out that manufacturers
continue to see an upward trend in in-
dustrial activity.
nPHE reader may well find this inconclu-
A sive, the more so because, despite the
generally recognised shortage of labor,
only 31 p.c. said this was the main single
factor limiting their ability to increase
production, whereas 34 p.c. reckoned
that the principal reason was shortage of
orders. Only 14 p.c. attributed this to
inadequate capacity, 6 p.c. to shortages
of materials and 3 p.c. to inadequate
finance. Equally confusing, only_7s p.c.
stated they were working at a satisfactory
full rate of operation; the other 25 p.c.
said they were not.
Going back a few months, the ANZ
Bank economists also throw some doubts
on the buoyancy of industry. Their Nov-
ember release reveals that, from prelim-
inary figures, the Bank’s index of factory
production, seasonally adjusted, appears
to have remained fairly stable over the
months from June to September inclu-
sive. During this period output of durable
consumption goods dropped by 4 p.c.,
while non-durables production rose by
5 p.c.
The National Bank takes up this theme
with the observation that the trend in
industry is uneven: “for some time there
has been a growing opinion that the rate
of growth in manufacturing industries is
beginning to slow down”. It admits this is
happening in some industries and even
that “some important industries, includ-
ing producers of a wide range of con-
sumer durables such as refrigerators,
washing machines and cotton and wool-
len goods have not shared in the gener-
ally rising trend.”
“The rate of growth, too, in some in-
dustries which had previously been ex-
panding at unusually high rates has been
falling.” Against this, the Bank thinks the
general ground swell is continuing and
“rather than slowing down, the rate of
growth is tending to spread itself over
more industries; the rate of growth, for
instance of the more basic products in-
cluding iron, steel, gas, bricks and clay,
may be settling down but it seems that
this is being offset by a renewal of growth
in previously tardy products.”
The National finds the main devil of


the piece not lack of orders, as in the case
of the ’Wales, but labor shortages. Short
of a drastic increase in the migrant in-
take, it thinks the present 5 p.c. increase
a year in the labor force cannot be main-
tained, as the “unemployed pool is drain-
ed to the limit’’. It then asks the vital
question “will our hopes of future growth
be checked by lack of this vital re-
source?”
The Bank thinks the answer to this is
complex. “Undoubtedly, labor shortages
will have a dampening effect on growth
in a number of important industries but
the relationship between labor and pro-
duction is by no means inflexible. The
marked rise in manufacturing output per
worker in the full employment situation
of the late 1950 s sets a record which we
must aim to better in the coming years.
A major help to this objective could be,
in framing national policies for the
future, to place less emphasis on industry
and business viewed in the aggregate,
and to pay more attention to the prob-
lems and situation of its detailed seg-
ments. For example, it is highly unlikely
that productivity will be rapidly improved
where it is most needed, nationally, by
some policy of overall restraint, even if
a steadying hand is needed in certain
specific directions.
“11/" 1 ™ mar gi ns squeezed fairly
’" tightly in many industries at present,
the encouragement of new techniques and
innovations designed to make more effi-
cient use of our limited resources of
labor and other basic productive factors
is a paramount need. This is, perhaps,
the most difficult of our problems in
present circumstances. Adequate oppor-
tunities for introduction of the capital in-
vestment necessary to implement dynamic
expansion programmes within our manu-
facturing industry, where appropriate,
must be given a high place in any scheme
of such encouragement.
“A period of prosperity and confidence
is an ideal starting point for the initiation
of projects, both short-term and long-
term, which introduce new innovations
and techniques. At this stage, these pro-
jects are not only vital to raise output
per man but they are more likely to be
undertaken in the present atmosphere
than at other times. We ought to be pre-
pared, therefore, to encourage investment
of this type despite the present strain on
the capital equipment industries, even if
in so doing imports of capital rise
further. Now is the time for definite
action to keep alive and revitalise the
advance of manufacturing in Australia,
but to move successfully in this direc-
tion without aggravating overall pressure
upon our resources may well require an
even greater degree of collaboration be-
tween Government and industry than has
so far been customary.”
CROESUS
The Power to Diversify
ICIANZ’s ever-widening net
Qpeaking strictly from the viewpoint of
the individual firms involved this
may seem an inappropriate week to be
questioning whether the established trend
towards more diversification of their
activities by super-sized Australian in-
dustrial groups is altogether desirable.
For, as readers will be aware, one of
the most conspicuous of diversifiers,
ICIANZ, has just come up with a 24.3
p.c. increase in profit for its latest year
to September 30 last. By notching up
the not untidy sum of £4| million this
year, the group has more than doubled
its profits since 1960-61, a relatively
poor year, and has added more than £l£
million to them since the previous peak
year 1959-60. As an advertisement for
the benefits of diversification this record
stands unimpeached.
Of course, in ICIANZ’s case, diversi-
fication has mostly been concentrated in
J. R. A. GLENN
Chairman of ICIANZ
its own special and almost unlimited field
for expansion, chemicals. Lest observers
think the manufacture of artificial fibres
and fertilisers, two of its latest loves,
may be stretching the definition a bit,
there is no gainsaying they are just as
appropriately defined as chemicals, say,
as paint and petroleum catalysts and
even more so perhaps than slide fasteners
and wallpaper. All these products have
now as respectable a place in the group’s
sales lists as its truly industrial chemicals,
explosives, plastics, dyes and drugs. The
list is as long as your arm.
So it could be argued that ICIANZ
is sticking more or less to easily identi-
fiable lines of its basic business. It is
certainly doing so more than BHP, which
has recently added oil search and tin to
its activities, or than British Tobacco,
which is now going in for farming, soft
drinks, packaging and even a little bit of
food, or than National Consolidated,
which is now doing a nice business in
greeting cards as a supplement to its
far-ranging manufacture of automotive
components (its main business), windows
and their fittings, eyelets for the foot-
wear trade, components for radios and
television sets, hot water bottle stoppers
and goodness knows what else.
If these few examples don’t quite make
the point, there is also Ansett Transport
Industries Ttd. Ansett now has only 59
p.c. of its assets in the basic airlines
operations. The rest are spread over road
passenger operations (6 p.c.), hotels and
tourist resorts (9 p.c.), road freighting
operations (4 p.c.), the manufacture of
instruments, electronic equipment, road;
coaches, domestic oil heaters, office
partitions, aircraft seats and so on (9 p.c.f
and, as far removed from any of these
as can be imagined, television (9 p.c.).
Unfortunately for the shareholders of
these highly diversified groups this is the
age of consolidated accounts. Unlike
companies which specialise on one or
two products, there is no way of know-'
ing whether production of the separate
and far-ranging sidelines are profitable,
or whether the investment in them has
simply been made merely to satisfy the
whim of the managing director or chair-
man. Their profit or loss experience is
hidden by the smokescreen of the con-
solidated statements and is lucky if it
gets a mention in the report or chair-
man's address for the year. Nor does this
apply merely to sidelines. In a group the
size of ICIANZ, there are so many big
lines that a full detailed run-down on
their trading experience for the year'
would be a tall order and is not generally
attempted.
This is not to say that in any of these
companies the boards are off their heads
in spreading their wings wherever a profit
possibility beckons. It is simply question-
ing the desirability, say on productivity-
grounds, looked at nationally as well as
from the shareholders’ viewpoint. It is
also enquiring whether such companies
with powerful finance tie-ups should be
permitted, to the exclusion of those less
favorably placed, to go where they will
and even be encouraged on their way by
Governments through patronage an( *
taxation concessions in a country whose
business is being increasingly dominated

by a narrowing range of big
entrepreneurs.
On the score of productivity there can
.be no doubt that a group with such far-
flung interests and so many products as
ICIANZ must have difficulty in mini-
mising dis-economies both in manu-
facturing and administration. This would
apply, of course, even if the group were
manufacturing only a few of its major
'products spread over several locations.
The task of maximising productivity
must be all the more intractable with
the vast range of products actually pro-
duced by the group at such a large
number of places. On the other hand,
'ICIANZ would probably argue that its
'productivity is boosted by economies of
' scale to a much higher level than could
'be achieved by a number of independent
firms covering the same volume of output
i for particular products. Equally it would
point to its economies of integration,
i where the finished product of one process
'becomes the raw material or component
for another, as so frequently happens in
ICIANZ.
In some cases ICIANZ has gone into
the production of some products using
materials produced by the group only
outside manufacturers were in-
efficient and at others in order to widen
the market for its own materials. That
would seem to be sensible, indeed almost
mandatory, for the company.
My point, however, concerns products
not dependent on integration with other
group operations, products that could
stand on their own feet under non-group
-auspices. Some of these may be side-
lines, say slide fasteners; others big
volume products, say terylene or nylon,
whose raw materials in the case of
ICIANZ here are largely imported from
the UK parent company. ICIANZ would
be shocked at any suggestion that it
■ shouldn’t be expanding in these direc-
tions, but it would be healthy for the
economy, if not for the company, if
other people were making these things
instead.
- There would seem to be an equally
arguable case for BHP to get out of oil
search, Ansett out of television, British
Tobacco (mainly owned overseas) out of
soft drinks, and National Consolidated
out of greeting cards. Of course none of
these things is going to happen.
Nor, on their present showing at any
rate, are Governments of whatever
political complexion going to stop the big
industrial complexes casting their nets
even further into the sea of products.
As far as is known, no takeover has ever
been stopped on the grounds that it
Would make a big group still bigger or
that a particular acquisition was un-
related to the bidder’s established line of
business. No company has failed to get
registered because the field of its
designated activities was already crowded
or somebody in it raised an objection.
Patronage will continue to be exercised
according to the lights of those in power.
Indeed, looking back on Australia’s
industrial growth, perhaps its outstanding
feature, seen as early as the expansion by
the Barrier lead-zinc companies some
fifty years ago into a wide range of
manufacturing industries, has been
diversification from the base of financial
success into unrelated activities. With-
out this feeling for conquering new in-
dustrial worlds and the financial power
to back it, Australian manufacturing in-
dustry would not cover nearly the same
ground or variety of products as it does
today. By the same token, the big in-
dustrial groups would not be in their
present unrivalled position to drive to-
wards even further diversification. They
certainly don’t need official encourage-
ment through tax concessions such as
special investment allowances at the
present juncture.


The Office Space Race
Dampening down from oversupply
Vfow that the shine has worn off the
office space letting boom, estate
agents are taking careful stock of what
the future holds. Thoughts on prospects
are many and varied..
Estate agents in Melbourne and Sydney
The Bulletin spoke to presented differ-
ent pictures of conditions in their respec-
tive cities. Melbourne agents seem to
agree that a situation of oversupply
of office space is “imminent”. Those in
Sydney generally say supply has been
well matched to demand.
However, one dissenting Sydney agent
said that, in view of available office space
(some of which has been vacant for
more than two years), the market was
definitely oversupplied. There are indi-
cations, too, that office space to let in
1965 will be only 60 to 70 p.c. of the
space available in 1964. In turn, 1964’s
space was less than 1963’5, showing a
trend towards a decreasing market. “This
will go on for the next ten years,” said
one agent.
To a certain extent the office building
boom has been caused by undercapitali-
sation of sites. Where rates and taxes
have to be paid on improved and unim-
proved capital value, owners have found
it more economical to spread the charges
over, say, 15 floors, instead of the pre-
vious three or four. The demand for
air-conditioned office space, too, has had
a marked effect on building.
The following table gives an idea of
some of the space available and rents
charged in Sydney.
SYDNEY Rent
per
Building Space available sq. ft. p.a.
IBM Centre 3 floors 525. and up
Pearl Assurance 2 floors 555.-60 s.
Bligh House 4 floors 525. 6d.
Sun Alliance 14 floors 555.-60 s.
VACC House 8 floors 455.
Flotta Lauro House 11 floors 375. 6d.-475. 6d.
Australia Square 1,100 sq.ft. 48s. 6d.
Comm. Union 4,000 sq. ft. 50s.
ASL House 40,000 sq. ft. 40s.
Angel House 20,000 sq. ft. 355.-40 s.
Shaw House 25,000 sq. ft. 40s.
Brit. Tob. House 50,000 sq. ft. 525. 6d.
Carlton Centre 100,000 sq. ft. 50s.
Some of the buildings in the list have
been available for some months; others,
not yet completed, will not be available
for rental until next year.
An executive of Jones Lang Wootton,
the old-established London-based firm
which has moved into Australia, de-
scribed as a “fallacy” the rumor that
there is a surplus of new office space in
Sydney. “We have left on our books
for this year the Plaza Building (the first
stage of the Australia Square project in
the heart of the city) where one-fifth of
one floor is available, three floors of the
IBM Centre, two floors of Pearl Assur-
ance House, the ground and three floors
of Bligh House, and two floors of ADC
House at North Sydney. Most of the
space has become available this year and
out of a total of 84 floors only lli are
left. The supply has been well designed to
meet demand.
“Next year we’ll have a total of 63
floors spread over the Sun Alliance build-
ing, Associated National House, Flotta
Lauro House, VACC House and 127/
131 Macquarie Street. We don’t antici-
pate any trouble in letting these.
“Generally there is a tendency for
people to stay in the city, although re-
cently there has been a small move to the
perimeter. ADC House at North Syd-
ney was slow to move at first, but now
there are only two floors left. Generally
speaking, tenants of this type of building
have no need to stay in the city—
advertising agencies and so on. Lower
rentals in areas like those are more
attractive, too. However, this is a limited
trend.
“In Sydney there is a move back to the
Circular Quay area for office space. Most
of the space available, or becoming avail-
able, is concentrated between Martin
Place and the Quay. And not all this
space is being taken by Australians. A
lot of American, British and Japanese
concerns are now seeking offices. With
these and the local needs there is a defi-
nite demand for the space we can let. i
“A lot of the demand for new space
has been caused by companies who arei
thinking more and more about their staff.
Air conditioning, toilet facilities, proxi-
mity to shopping areas, well-lit offices—
all these attract staff and keep them. An,
employer who thinks in these terms not 1
only gets and keeps staff, he gets more
from them in terms of efficiency.
“I think the years of the big building
boom are past for the time being and
we can expect to see a gradual decline in
the future,” the executive added.
John Steinwade, executive officer ok
the city sales and leasing department of'
L. J. Hooker, said that in the last 12*
months, during which most big occupiers I
of city buildings had moved into their
new premises, “things have quietened (
down. In 1958, the building boonfi
started after rent control was lifted.” ,
(In Sydney rent control applies to bothi
residential and commercial premises com-*
menced before 1958. Buildings com-|
menced after that date are not subject toj
rent control which is calculated on the
1939 valuation of the building.)
“Over the past few years the produce
tion of office space has been geared toj
demand, so there is not a great
Space will become available as it is re-1
quired now, and by the end of 1965 it
will be pretty much the landlords’ way.”j
VS/hen tenants move into new office
" space, what happens to the old? Said
Mr Steinwade: “Most of the old office |
space is fairly decrepit and represents anr
undercapitalisation of the site. The!
general practice now is to pull the oldf
building down and build a bigger one on I
the old site. This means that rates and,
taxes can be spread over a larger area,’
and thus a greater number of tenants, j
The old sites are now being redeveloped (
to their maximum use and economy.
“There is a constant demand for neWf
office space. It is quite possible that)
the latent demand exceeds the existing
supply, but for the restrictions of the
Landlord and Tenant Act. If rent con-1
trol was lifted and rentals on older build- 1
ings were brought more into line with J
new office space, demand would be r
greatly increased.
“If production of office space remains
as it is you will find that most of the
office space in down-town Sydney is de-i
controlled. When this happens there will l
probably be a challenge in the Act andj
control on all buildings could be lifted.” v
Mr Ken Walters, a director of Richard-',
son and Wrench, feels there is a “pretty
good balance at this time between supply 1
and demand for office space in Sydney. <
There is a move to spread municipal!
rates, land tax and water rates over a
larger area, thus reducing the landlord sj
outgoings in terms of his income. j

“Owners have been forced into a
decision to rebuild because of these high
charges,” Mr Walters said. “The rapid
building that has taken place over the
last five years is the first building of any
magnitude in Sydney for the last 20
years. During this time the population
has nearly doubled, so there has been,
very obviously, a need for increased
office space.
“At the moment we have on our books
1100 feet left of the 108,000 feet avail-
able in the Plaza on the Australia Square
site, available at 48s. 6d. a foot. There is
4000 of the 120,000 square foot Com-
mercial Union Building left at 50s. a
square foot. Next year we’ll have ASL
House, 40,000 square feet of it, for rent
at about 40s. a square foot.
“The office space letting industry will
quieten down over the next ten or so
years. We’ve caught up with the back-
lag of requirements now. While there is
a decline in demand it means more work
for us. When there is a big demand for
space the owner doesn’t have to worry
about agents. Our hard work starts when
the owner has trouble letting.”
One Sydney agent feels that the mar-
ket is oversupplied. He is Mr D. M.
Higgins, joint managing director of Raine
and Horne. “The supply is more than
meeting demand,” he said. “There are
several buildings around the city which
have had vacant space for months. There
is not as much new space available now,
however, as there was three or four
months ago. But the space that is left
is taking a lot longer to shift than pre-
viously.
“And it is a lot harder to let older
office space. We have had buildings
where there has not been a vacancy for
20 years. Now that there are vacancies
we are having trouble re-letting them,
even though the rents may be lower.
One of the causes of this is air-condi-
tioning. It is hard to let space that is
not air-conditioned nowadays.”
In Melbourne the picture of office
space letting differs slightly from Syd-
ney. Williams and Co., which specia-
lises in suburban office letting and in
the outer city area, said there was a
trend away from the city of Melbourne
proper to areas like Queen’s and St Kilda
Roads and also to East Melbourne, where
professional people seemed to be develop-
ing an affinity for terrace houses. “The
main factor in the anti-city trend is cost
combined with parking difficulties. The
latter is prohibitive enough to send poten-
tial lessees away, even when the rent is
quite cheap. Big offices are often diffi-
cult to let, except to big Australian com-
panies, Government departments and, of
course, Americans. The one-room office
and the average-sized areas of 800 to
1400 square feet are more often in short
supply than not. Older premises seem
easier to let, mainly because of the cost
factor. The main market for new pre-
mises seems to come from people who
have to purvey a modern image to
clients.”
The following table gives an idea of
some of the space available in Mel-
bourne, this year and next.
Building Space Rent
National Mutual 22,000 sq. ft. 455.-525.
H. C. Sleigh 2,000 sq. ft. 505.-555.
Chamber M'frs 12,000 sq. ft. 355.
BP Building 32,000 sq. ft. 475. 6d.
Union Fidelity - 475. 6d.*
Royal Insurance 120,000 sq. ft. 475. 6d.-525. 6d.
Lend Lease 7 floors 385.-425. 6d.
*Only whole floors ava : lable.
A spokesman for Baillieu Allard,
which has handled the bulk of new office
space since the war, felt that supply and
demand were in balance now but such
would not be the case by the end of
1965. Between now and then, around
three-quarters of a million square feet
of new space will be completed. Because
of the limited market for all this space,
oversupply would result. Filling would
be helped to a certain extent by some
solicitors, sharebrokers and accountants
(they form the bulk of tenants in the
city) who were forced to move into these
bigger and more costly areas by their
mere size. In many of the older build-
ings the necessary space was just not
available and, if it was, it had to be
taken on three floors instead of one.
Contrary to the general belief that this
trend would cause a surplus in the mid-
dle-class offices too, the spokesman felt
that such buildings, like Collins House
and some of the banks, would see any
vacant areas being taken over by existing
tenants. Many of them are very tight at
present and the chance of getting more
space without having to move into new
and more costly premises would be
quickly snapped up.
The really old offices, especially those
on the city fringes, would see increasing
vacancy rates. “Of course they are see-
ing them already but by December next
year the situation could be really bad.”
The spokesman said the swing to the St
Kilda Road area had decreased consider-
ably over the past two years, mainly
because of its relative inconvenience, the
fact that more space was becoming
available in the city and the fact that
parking, although still a problem, was a
great deal better thanks to a minor boom
in the building of car parks.
A spokesman for George G. Hender-
son, who shares the majority of the city’s
old office letting with the Baillieu Allard
people, felt there was a move away from
the city proper by professional people,
though the swing was not as strong as
some people imagined. There was a
nucleus, like retailers and wholesalers,
whose interests were best served by stay-
ing in the city area. Nevertheless, it
seemed that before very long there would
be a general state of oversupply, caused
mainly by all the building going on at
present.

Dull, But Firmer Rally
Still no positive market rush
Australian share markets rallied a
little after the success of the Menzies
Government at the Senate elections,
though there was no concerted rush to
buy.
Brokers continue to report a very dull
market, except for some sharp fluctua-
tions in mining shares.

T ooking to next year, investors now
wonder what effect the US will have
on world markets.
Wall Street, for example, became un-
easy when the Federal Reserve Bank
raised its discount rate to prevent an
outflow of money after the British rate
was raised to 7 p.c.
The protective move by the Federal
Reserve Bank was designed for the short-
term money market, because it is anxious
to keep long-term money at a reasonable
rate so as to maintain the current boom
in America.
Some of the other banks, however,
raised interest rates on business loans.
It is felt that if money tightens up in the
US it will put an effective brake on cur-
rent prosperity.
The Federal Reserve Bank took un-
precedented steps to announce that it was
still committed to a generous monetary
policy and it saw no reason for an in-
crease in business loan interest rates. To
back up its policy, it bought Government
securities to infuse more liquidity into
the banking system.

T>radford Cotton has been strongly

both companies could benefit from the

AlTilliam Adams continues to report
” good results. It is possible that these
shares could be bought more cheaply by
way of the notes at 61s. The notes con-
vert into shares next May on the basis
of two 10s. shares for one 20s. note.
Apart from the price disparity there
is a small saving in brokerage, because
two shares at 325. would cost Is. in

The company, which is a dyer and
finisher, has the Australian rights to the
Japanese synthetic fibre Cashmilon.
A recent one-for-five issue at ss. pre-

Back-door Takeovers
Making use of local financiers
nPHE Devon Credits bid for Sulphates
may well be the latter’s saving grace.
A Melbourne-based chemical manu-
facturer, it had boxed itself into a very
tight corner as regards future profits and
dividend-paying capacity by the end of
the 1963-64 financial year. A record loss
of some £43,000 was the fourth in
succession. Cash reserves had been de-
pleted to the extent where dividends
could not be distributed as they had been
in the previous loss years. This policy had
made the company’s affairs look very
gloomy indeed (see p. 68 of last week’s
issue).
But the bid of 10s. 3d. for each 20s.
share has changed all this. Providing it is
accepted, of course. Directors have
advised shareholders not to sell, pending
the receipt of further information now
being sought. A recommendation is
expected by December 18.
Some shareholders have sold out
already, thanks to a rather bad leakage
of information from an unknown source
prior to the takeover announcement. On
November 18 the shares were selling for
11s. On December 3, five days after the
year’s loss and the omission of the divi-
dend were made public, they were actu-
ally higher at 15s. On December 4, the
day of the bid, the price touched 16s. 4d.
before the announcement was made.
During these 16 days, turnover was more
than 23,000, compared with 400 in the
previous fortnight. In fact, the figure
was higher than the total turnover from
January 1 right through to October 30.
Devon, an Adelaide-based financier,
was undoubtedly prodded into this some-
what unlikely diversification move with
the help of Sir Arthur Bruce, who joined
the board last August. He is a director
of Wallace Bros, of London, which,
with the Bombay Burmah Trading Cor-
poration and Provincial Insurance of the
UK, took up 400,000 shares in Devon
earlier this year. The Wallace-Bombay
group already held 200,000 of the ss.
units before this move, so that. Devon
is now substantially controlled from
overseas —20 p.c. by the Wallace group
and 10 p.c. by Provincial. Through
Devon, they may soon end up with a
finger in the Sulphates pie, too.
The Wallace-Bombay group have joint
and separate interests in commercial and
industrial ventures all over the world.
In 1863 the Wallace family set up in
London as a private firm of East Indian
merchants and bankers. In the same year
they floated the Bombay company and,
today, Wallace have a large shareholding
and act as managers for it. Provincial
started up in 1903, came to Australia in
1933 and is now one of Britain’s largest
independent offices. It has investments
out here with a market value of more
than £H million. Devon may at present
be only the embryo of the size it could
one day grow to.
With all this overseas backing floating
about, more takeovers may be in the
wind for Devon. It is doubtful whether
even the Sulphates bid could have been
made without financial assistance of
some sort from outside the company.
Overseas backing means that these
smaller financiers could become prevalent
on the Australian takeover scene and an
important means of entry for foreign
capital, through the back door so to
speak. Last August, the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation acquired
40 p.c. of Mercantile Credits. Last May,
the National Commercial Bank of Scot-
land bought 25 p.c. of Beneficial Finance.
In another move, the Fidelity Phila-
delphia Trust Co. acquired 10 p.c. of
Hooker Finance.
Only last week, it was announced that
the London-based Chartered Bank is to
tike out a 40 p.c. equity interest in the
local company, Mutual Acceptance. The
directors’ statement that the link will
enable a more substantial expansion of
Mutual’s activities supports the belief
that these financiers may become an im-
portant tool for more local takeovers by
foreign capital, via the financier. The
Chartered Bank was founded in 1853
and now has assets of more than £579
million at home and through substantial
interests in the Middle and Far East as
well as Europe and America.
Stocking the Stocking
A re you stumped for presents again
this Christmas? What about your
wife —is she fed up with fur coats? Are
the children tired of toys?
These questions head the December
circular from a Melbourne stockbroking
firm. The answers are probably “Yes”,
“She hasn’t even got a fur coat” and
“The kids are still short of toys because
they’ve broken everything else I’ve given
them”. Undaunted, the broker presses
on to suggest a few share parcels which
would make suitable gifts to those nearest

mas bonus will cover that easily!
For the wife 100 Myer shares (£180);
dividends will soften the blow of the
monthly account. With a lifetime ahead,
50 Mt Isa’s (£101) should prove an out-
standing long-term performer for your

Petersville (£57) would be just the thing
on the grounds of the recovery due this

For bowl-playing grandfather and
grandmother a debenture in a bank-

acceptable from an income point of view
(£100). “Favorite” aunt deserves 100
units in a mutual fund (£25) —she has no
time to manage her own investments with
church meetings, Red Cross, card parties
and the inevitable baby-sitting. For your

THE SOUTH BRITISH INSURANCE COMPANY
LIMITED
Address to Shareholders by the Chairman,
Mr. Kenneth B. Myers,
at the Annual General Meeting, held at the Head Office of the Company,
Auckland, New Zealand, on 26th November, 1964.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before proceeding to the business of the
Meeting, I should like to refer to the
appointment of Mr. T. H. C. Caughey as
one of your Directors. Mr. Caughey, who
fills the seat left vacant by the retirement of
Mr. J. F. Ewen last year, will be well known
to you for his interest in public affairs and
his experienced counsel is of considerable
benefit to deliberations at the Boardroom
table.
Revenue Accounts
Assuming that, as customary, the
Accounts may be taken as read, the year
just closed has revealed itself as an import-
ant one in your Company’s history with
premium income of the Group exceeding
the £NZ15,000,000 mark for the first time.
The increase on the previous year’s figure
of no less than £NZ1,583,806 reflects the
vigour with which the Group’s operations
continue to be conducted although it does
not in itself reveal what is of equal import-
ance the extent to which unsatisfactory
business has been eliminated.
Overall loss ratio at 55.6% shows a
fractional but welcome improvement and
although expenses, inclusive of taxation,
rose by £NZ331,385 in keeping with the ex-
pansion of revenue, it is pleasing to be able
again to report a further reduction in the
ratio which management expenses bear to
total premium income. After making
appropriate departmental provisions for
premiums written but not fully earned, by
the appropriation to Reserve for Unexpired
Risks of £NZ772,644, Group Underwriting
profit for the year was £NZ493,431 which
your Directors regard as satisfactory.
Profit and Loss Account
Consolidated income from investments
after deduction of tax rose to over
£NZ940,000 and after making due allow-
ance for depreciation and deduction of out-
side shareholders’ interests, the net profit of
the Group was £NZ1,253,280.
It is gratifying, to know that all subsidiar-
ies contributed to this result and in some
measure this is attributable to the policy
of allowing them to retain a large pro-
portion of their own earnings to strengthen
their reserves and improve their position as
national companies.
Dividend
An interim dividend of N.Z.9d. per share
was paid in April last and having regard
to the favourable underwriting result, your
Directors now recommend a final dividend
of NZI/ld. to make a total for the year
of NZI/lOd. per share. If approved, the
total distribution will amount to
£NZ889,107.
Balance Sheets
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, fixed
assets have increased by over £NZ7OO,GOO.
In the main, this is accounted for by
completion of the United Company’s new
Head Office building in Sydney. I had the
pleasure of attending the opening ceremony
last April when this fine twelve-storey
structure on the corner of George and
Hunter Streets was the subject of much
favourable comment. Besides providing up-
to-date and congenial Head Office and
Branch accommodation for the United, it
constitutes a very valuable Group asset.
Other items call for no particular comment
although the increase of over £NZSOO,OOO
in Shareholders’ Funds will not have
escaped your notice.
In the Parent Company’s Balance Sheet
you will see that the item “Investments in
Subsidiary Companies” has increased by
just over £NZ271,000. This reflects the
reference in the Directors’ Report to the
acquisition of The Eastern United Assurance
Corporation Limited, which has its head-
quarters in Australia.
It will be recalled that in 1959 I men-
tioned that a substantial block of shares
in this former subsidiary had been sold
to a group of overseas interests which
placed us in the position of minority share-
holders. We were appointed Managing
Agents but it was subsequently agreed that
the interests of all concerned would best
be served by complete control of Eastern
United being vested in our hands. It was
accordingly decided to make an offer for
the shares held by all outside shareholders
and this being accepted, Eastern United
became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The Corporation does not conduct an
extensive insurance business but supported
by its portfolio of investments, it makes a
very useful addition to the Group.
Trading Review
I think the unhappy collective experience
over recent years of insurers writing world-
wide accounts is sufficiently well known for
it not to be surprising that 1963 has been
described by the Chairman of the British
Insurance Association as about the worst
year for British insurance since the San
Francisco disaster of 1906.
Although not up to the result returned
by the South British Group last year, the
underwriting profit of just under £NZi
million must, in the circumstances, be
regarded as a creditable achievement, par-
ticularly when considered in the light of
influences that have so affected the insur-
ance industry as a whole. Lesser exposure
to these elements in certain spheres has
resulted in our branches and subsidiaries
in New Zealand, Australia and Africa
returning improved results, operations in
the Indian sub-continent and the Far East
have been slightly less profitable but on
the other hand, we have suffered under-
writing losses in Canada and United King-
dom.
Our non-marine business in the United
States has now completely run off but we
continue to write a marine account in New
York. For many years we have written a
portfolio of fire business in Canada but
following the unfavourable experience of
that market generally, it has been decided,
though not without some regret, to suspend
our operations in that field as from 31st
December next.
In the United Kingdom we have not
escaped the adverse trend that has so
seriously affected the results of very many
companies and we have taken steps to
curtail our underwriting on business directly
under our control. However, not only have
our direct activities proved most unreward-
ing, but it is principally by the medium of
our London organisation that we conduct
the international exchange of reinsurance
which is an integral part of our business
and through this channel we have suffered
the impact of the very unfavourable results
of British and Continental insurers. This is
the prime cause of the increase of some
4 points in the loss ratio of our Fire
Account and the reduction in the profit
of that department.
It is to be hoped that the steps now
being taken jointly by United Kingdom
companies to correct the deteriorating situa-


tion will prove helpful, although improve-
ment will inevitably take time.
If you will allow me to digress for a
moment, I should like to comment on a
domestic matter which in my view is of
national importance. It appears to be of
little concern in this country that assessed
fire losses in 1963 amounted to more than
£NZ3,250,000 while for the first six months
of 1964, the figure is just under
£NZ2,000.000 which in itself exceeds the
total for the whole of 1953. I draw atten-
tion to this not only from the aspect of
insurance, but also from the point of view
that these losses amount to a serious econo-
mic waste, very often including a loss of
production, which our country is not in a
position to afford, creating a situation which
I suggest does not warrant the complacency
with which it appears to be accepted.
Returning to our own affairs, it is pleas-
ing to report an improved result from
accident business, while in the intensely com-
petitive conditions which remain a feature
of marine insurance, the return from that
department is satisfactory.
Investments
The deployment of the Company’s in-
vestments to best advantage continues to
receive the active attention of your Board.
During the past year there has been a
broad similarity of pattern in the invest-
ment climate in most of the areas where
we have important financial interests.
Generally, there has been a rising level of
business activity at profit levels that have
been restrained by competition. This has
been achieved largely by bringing former
excess capacity into production, and im-
proved trading results have resulted from
higher throughput and technological
advances. In these conditions employable
labour has been fully absorbed.
There appears to have been some degree
of hesitation further to expand capacity
and this caution is probably due to two
factors a reluctance to become involved
in boom conditions which may lead to a
painful re-adjustment, and a realisation that
demand for more labour than is available
leads to higher wage costs rather than
expansion of the workforce.
Under these conditions there has been
a tendency to put funds aside for future
development, with a desire to place them
in the meantime in readily realisable in-
vestments that show a good return. There
has therefore been considerable pressure
of demand for the classes of security that
are most suitable for our funds, and the
difficulty in securing suitable investments
is reflected in a rather high level of short-
term deposits included in the accounts.
The strength of this demand for liquid
investment has had some inflationary effect
in values, particularly of shares, but this
has been tempered by waves of nervousness
due to political uncertainties, and anxiety
lest official action be taken to curb boom
conditions that may be in course of develop-
ment. In this variable atmosphere, larger
investors tend to remain on the sidelines
waiting for conditions to settle, an attitude
which tends to be self-perpetuating.
In these circumstances the maintenance
of a wide spread of investments, both of
types as well as geographically, is just as
important as a spread in underwriting activi-
ties, and continuance of this policy places
us in a position to take advantage of
developments as they occur.
The increase in investment income which
includes net rents received from properties,
reflects the larger volume of funds
employed, and although the net return was
adversely affected by the increased taxation
announced in the Australian budget, it
can, in the circumstances I have described,
be considered a satisfactory outcome of
the year’s activity.
Properties
In furtherance of our policy of providing
our staff with modern office accommodation
and facilities, new buildings were opened
at Masterton and Lower Hutt in March last,
while the interior of our Dunedin premises
has been completely renovated with excel-
lent effect. Opportunity was also taken to
purchase properties at Papatoetoe and at
Bunbury, Western Australia, in view of the
promising development of our business in
those centres.
Our Durban building, completed in 1941,
has become inadequate for branch accom-
modation and your Board had no hesitation
in accepting an attractive offer for the pro-
perty which coincided with the opportunity
to lease desirable alternative premises for
our branch establishment.
Staff
This review of the past year’s activities
would not be complete without a tribute
to the work of the staff and the figures
before you speak for the able performance
of their tasks.
The Company will again make its cus-
tomary contribution to the Provident Fund
and in anticipation of your wishes, provi-
sion has been made in the accounts for
payment to the staff of a cash bonus to
which you are invited to signify approval.
The Future
It would be incorrect for anyone to
assume that the improved underwriting
results from Africa, Australia and New
Zealand to which I made earlier reference
are simply due to good fortune. Each of
these fields is keenly competitive but has
so far retained a greater degree of stability
than the much larger markets of the north-
ern hemisphere.
Since a major function of insurance is
to provide the protection so necessary to
industry and commerce, it is as much in
the interests of the business community as
of the insurance industry itself that this
essential service should not be provided at
a loss. The best means of achieving this
is through a stable insurance market allow-
ing reasonable margins of profit and if
stability is to be maintained in the terri-
tories to which I have just referred, it
behoves all sections of those markets to
exercise a due sense of responsibility in
their particular spheres of activity to the
ultimate benefit of the insuring public as
well as of themselves.
So far as this Company is concerned, it
remains our aim to provide a first-class
service to policyholders consistent with
adherence to sound underwriting principles
which, within the limits of any applicable
legislation, includes freedom to select the
business underwritten. It has always been
the policy of your Board that premium
volume is not the only consideration and
that contracts which do not offer reasonable
prospects of profit are not worth accepting.
It is in large measure due to the practical
application of that policy by our Branch
Managers, under guidance and assistance
from Head Office, that satisfactory under-
writing results have been presented to you
today.
While the nature of our business is such
that some fluctuation is to be expected, your
Board looks to the future with confidence.
Articles of Association
Shareholders will recall my reference last
year to discussions with the Australian and
London Stock Exchanges concerning Article
39 of the Company’s Articles of Associa-
tion which empowers the Directors to
decline to register transfers without assign-
ing any reason, this being held to be in
conflict with the principle of freedom of
transfer. As a result of those discussions,
the Stock Exchanges concerned agreed to
allow a further 12 months for the matter
to be considered.
The position remains under discussion
and we are grateful to the Australian Asso-
ciated Stock Exchanges and the London
Stock Exchange for their agreement to
extend the time limit until 30th June next
year.
Capitalisation of Profits
Two years ago I stated that your Direc-
tors were then of the opinion that it would
be inopportune to consider a liquidation of
reserves through a distribution of bonus
shares when no tangible benefit would
accrue to shareholders and in many cases,
their liability for taxation would be in-
creased. Nor would any benefit accrue to
the Company.
Adequate reserves are probably more
important to an insurance company than
to most other sectors of commerce, for
they not only promote the confidence of
policyholders, but also afford protection to
shareholders against losses on an unforeseen
scale. There has been more than one
occasion when insurance company share-
holders have had reason to be thankful for
strong reserves, the San Francisco disaster
referred to earlier being a case in point.
With the approach of the time limit
imposed by taxation legislation relating to
the issue of bonus shares from revenue
reserves, your Directors have again given
careful consideration to this matter and
having regard to additional funds accumu-
lated in the intervening period, feel, on
balance, they are now able to recommend
with confidence the distribution which
appears for consideration on today’s Agenda.
Under proposed legislation, the require-
ment for separate classification of these
shares falls away but in view of the
uncertainty of the position at the time
the resolution was drafted, it was considered
desirable for your Directors to be given
authority to designate a separate classifica-
tion in the event of there still being need
to do so.
Under the proposed amendment to the
Land and Income Tax Act 1954, the
separate classification of the existing “B”
shares specifically designated as such in
terms of that Act will be automatically
annulled by the operation of law. It is
therefore not intended to replace or amend
the “B” certificates but all new certificates
will be issued in the ordinary form.
This method of increasing capital does
not of itself increase your Company’s earn-
ing capacity. It will accordingly remain the
policy of your Board to relate dividend
recommendations to annual results and the
proposed increase in the Company’s
Issued Capital in no way implies a depart-
ure from that policy.

Chairman.

pany, Volkswagenwerk of Germany,
believes direct distribution will increase
sales. Lanock will still receive its share
of the extra market. The change in the
system of distribution follows Volks-
wagenwerk’s decision to invest a further
£20 to £30 million in Australia to satisfy
the requirements of the Department of
Trade and to increase local content.
Flourishing Engineer
Interim reports at this time of the year
tend to be overshadowed somewhat
by annual reports both good and bad.
However, one that should not be over-
looked is that from steel merchant and
engineer, William Adams and Co., which
has reported a 25 p.c. increase in sales
and a 32 p.c. increase in profit for the
half-year ended October.
Directors expect this trend to con-
tinue. They say sales rose from
£7,317,514 to £9,165,900 for the six
month period whilst profits climbed from
£179,150 to £236,825. Accordingly tax
provision has been increased from
£129,000 to £184,000. Interim dividend,
again 6} p.c., indicates continuance of
last year's higher rate of 123 p.c.
The 10s. shares are not for the specu-
being presently priced at 34s.,
where the dividend yield is 3.7 p.c. As
a long-term holding they are attractive.
Beery Bonus
HThe one-for-four bonus issue to be
made by the Swan Brewery next
February will not surprise too many
people. The record 1963-64 financial
year and the fact that no issue had been
made since 1961-62 had already given
rise to a certain expectancy. Perhaps the
ratio is a little higher than anticipated,
owing to the fact that the previous bonus
was a one-for-seven.
Shareholders will have to pay for this
generosity by taking a 123 p.c. dividend
on the new capital instead of the present
15 p.c. rate. Nevertheless, the overall
effect will be a small increase in cash
income. The payout for very 100 shares
at present is £3 15s. This will rise to
£3 18s. 13d. on every 125 shares after
the bonus.
The issue is being made from an asset
revaluation and the share premium
reserve. At the last balance date, total
reserves of £4.2 million were at the same
level as paid capital, giving a total for
shareholders’ funds of £8.4 million. Paid
capital will now rise to £5.3 million.

Attractive Assurance Stocks
A Melbourne stockbroking firm is advising clients to invest
in life assurance companies if they are looking for a
combination of safety and capital growth. From the very
narrow selection of listed companies who deal primarily in this
field they recommend two firms MLC Ltd for the longer
term and United Holdings for the shorter. There are 43 com-
panies transacting life business in Australia but only three are
listed here, the third being APA Holdings Ltd.
At present prices, MLC is considered particularly attractive.
Thanks to the H. G. Palmer takeover the once tight market
and short supply of shares have been eased appreciably. In
fact, the selling of some of the takeover shares has actually
depressed the MLC market to levels which are currently the
same, or slightly below, those ruling at the time of takeover,
even though the company’s profits have improved to a marked
degree since.
United Holdings is also considered attractively priced. When
the circular went out to clients it was felt that any retraction
in prices from 445. would warrant buying. Present prices are
well below this level, as the 445. was only one stage in a down-
ward price trend following a series of sharp upward moves
from 375. to 475. 6d. over the previous few weeks.
There are numerous reasons why the firm sees value in
either of these investments. First there is the high compound
rate of growth in earnings per share. Over the last two years,
MLC’s annual increase has been 25 p.c. This compares more
than favorably with the performance of other high-class in-
vestments such as newspapers and breweries. The “Herald
and Weekly Times” has scored 1 p.c., John Fairfax 4.4 p.c.,
and Queensland Press 3.4 p.c., while the SA Brewery has
managed 13.1 p.c., Tooth 16.2 p.c. and Swan 11.8 p.c.
United Holdings has not done quite so well, with an annual
improvement of only 10.5 p.c. No doubt its numerous bonus
issues have helped considerably to keep the figure down. How-
ever, quite apart from this, the company happens to be in a
rather unusual situation.
The real key to its future lies more in the 37.5 p.c. annual
increase in the value of policies written over the past two years
(thanks mainly to the buoyant rural industry). MLC has
scored only 11.4 p.c. It is this element which brings increased
premiums and a better surplus in future years. Even the
annual premiums increase of 16.6 p.c. over the two years
(MLC only 11.8 p.c.) does not fully mirror future growth, as
it is the practice to write off commission and other direct ex-
penses of new policies against the first year's premium. If
normal experience is followed, this recent great increase in new
business should be reflected strongly in increased earnings over
the next few years.
Second, there are several factors affecting the life assurance
game in general which have prompted the broker’s recom-
mendation. This describes the safety of the investment as
“very great” because of the tendency to list reserves and the
like in an extremely conservative fashion. Then again, adverse
economic conditions have a minimum effect, as premium
payments usually continue unless things get really bad.
The firm’s third argument involves the concept of the “con-
tinued growth of the life fund”. This, it says, is “the key to
the investment merits of life companies”. If, in any one year,
the premium income (less direct expenses) and the investment
income are added together and from the total claims, matur-
ities, surrenders and management expenses are deducted, the
resultant surplus is added to the life fund to give a continually
increasing return on capital (all other things being equal,
including the absence of any increase in capital). Thus we
arrive at a situation where the profitability and the safety of
an investment are increasing at the same time.
The circular then moves on to a closer analysis of the two
companies. MLC is the only one of the “big five” offices in
which shares can be bought by the public. The special situation
making the scrip so attractive is created by the fact that share-
holders are entitled to a minimum of 2 i p.c. of the declared
profits in the ordinary and industrial branches and to all of the
general branch surplus. Of the ordinary branch, which accounts
for the majority of business, they are at present receiving
3 p.c. and 4 p.c. of the industrial.
Needless to say, the policy holders get most of the yearly
surplus. In past years the percentage for shareholders has
been falling but, with increased business, the total amount has
been rising. In 1946, there was £77,000 from the ordinary
branch, representing 8.3 p.c. By 1962, this figure had grown
to £255,000 but the percentage had fallen to 3 p.c.
Very soon it will be down to 2i p.c. and there it will stay.
The key to all this is that, with surpluses rising, the actual
cash figure involved will also rise but at a greater rate than
it did before when percentages were falling. According to the
circular, there are estimates prepared which indicate that total
profit allocated to shareholders from the ordinary and industrial
branches alone will increase by a conservative 30 p.c. over the
next five years.
So MLC’s membership of the “big five” and these profits
which are expected to accrue to shareholders make the scrip
worth buying and holding for long-term growth combined
with a maximum of security.
United Holdings’ position has already been gone into to
some extent. Although relatively small it has major strength
through associations with primary producer organisations. It
also has a half interest in a company which built 123 houses
last year and is expected to build more this year. This invest-
ment provides a valuable source for mortgage loans and ac-
cident insurance. The growth in its life fund over the past
three years has been £700,000, £l.l million and £900,000.
More important to shareholders, however, is its unbeatable
issue history. Before listing, in 1960, a four-for-three bonus
was made. It was followed by a one-for-eight bonus in 1961,
another in 1962, and yet another in 1963.
So the broking firm recommends it for the shorter term,
having regard to its connection with the rural industry, the
big increases in premium income due from the astounding
growth in policy value over the past two years and to its
willingness to distribute benefits regularly to shareholders. It
should be noted that just after the circular had been compiled
and, unfortunately, just before it had been distributed to
clients, United Holdings announced a profit lift from £Bl,OOO
to £92,000 for the 1963-64 year and another one-for-eight
bonus issue making its fourth in four years.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Assets Surplus to Business?
James Stedman's investment portfolio
to the Sydney Stock Ex-
change statistical service, the sub-
sidiary of the present listed James Sted-
man Ltd, James Stedman Henderson’s
Sweets Limited, was formed in June,
1920. When this company was formed
(to effect the merger of James Stedman
Ltd and Henderson’s Sweets Ltd), the
ordinary capital was £530,690 and the
preference capital was £lOO,OOO. Today,
more than forty-four years later, the
preference capital is still unchanged but
the ordinary capital has been doubled.
This doubling of the ordinary capital
took place in late 1959, when James
Stedman was formed and offered two of
its shares for every one share in James
Stedman Henderson’s Sweets Ltd.
The shareholders have never been
asked to provide any further capital and,
over the last five years, the company has
not placed any reliance on any form of
outside finance at all. Even the bank
account seems to have been continually
in credit though, of course, we have no
idea of any possible seasonal movements.
During the last forty-odd years, assets
have been accumulated in the form of
cash and interest-bearing deposits, Gov-
ernment securities and other public
securities, debentures and shares of listed
public companies which cost £1,407,000
approximately and which were worth
about £1,534,000. It could well be
asked why the company has retained
profits to build up these assets, which
would appear to be surplus to the re-
quirements of the business.
most investors are now aware, James
Stedman’s profits declined in 1963-
64, thereby breaking an apparent five-
year run of increases. The word
“apparent” is used because it is not
possible to be certain that an increase
occurred from 1960-61 to 1961-62, since
the 1961-62 profit figures include New
Zealand profits converted into Aus-
tralian currency, whereas they had
previously been included at their par
value. However, it seems certain that
profits did, in fact, increase, because it
is unlikely that the New Zealand branch
made more profit than the Australian.
This would have been the case if the
£30,000 by which profits of the two
increased from 1960-61 to 1961-62 was
entirely due to the exchange content of
the New Zealand profit.
Profit declines have previously occurred
from 1956-57 to 1957-58, from 1950-51
to 1951-52 and from 1944-45 to 1945-46.
The six year pattern seems fairly evident
here, so last year’s drop should now be
the signal for another five years’ rising
earnings. It might be worth mentioning
that there is some evidence from the
profits over the last forty years that
James Stedman benefits with a buoyant
economy. Profits reached nearly £53,000
in 1928-29 and this figure was not
passed until twenty years later, in
1948-49. In 1928-29 the company paid
a 6 p.c. ordinary dividend. The follow-
ing year it was reduced to 3 p.c. and
no dividend was paid in 1930-31. From
then on, the dividend rate did not recover
to the 6 p.c. level until 1944-45. From
that time, however, dividend increases
have been fairly regular, such that the
growth rate has averaged about 10 p.c.
per annum compound and the £6 divi-
dend income of 1944-45 has become £3O
in 1963-64.
Because of the change in the method
of valuing New Zealand assets and
profits, it is only possible to make worth-
while comparisons for the last three
years. The strong impression is conveyed
that profit rates are falling fairly rapidly.
In James Stedman’s case, this decline in
earnings is being cushioned by the invest-
ment portfolio, which is showing rising
earnings, particularly since Government
and public securities have been reduced
in relation to other investments in the
portfolio. The following figures show the
rate of return before tax and deprecia-
tion on net assets. The first line (A)
includes investments and the second line
(B) excludes investments. “Investments”
has been taken to include “cash at bank
and on hand and on interest bearing
deposits”, partly because the interest
from the interest bearing deposits has
presumably been included under the
heading “income from investments
interest received” and partly because it
can be assumed that “cash” is surplus to
the requirements of running the business.
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964
Return on net assets:
(A) 17.2% 16.5% 15.3%
(B) 26.8% 23.8% 22.5%
Looking at the net position by charging
the whole of the depreciation provision
against the assets of the business and
allocating tax in respect of the interest
received as shown in the consolidated
profit and loss account, the return on
the funds invested becomes:
Year to June 30 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Earnings on invest-
ments including cash 2.1% 2.9% 3.2%
Earnings on business
assets 14.5% 12.0% 10.9%
On the basis of market values of in-
vestments, the total assets of the group
at June 30, 1964, was about £A3,752,000.
Of this figure, “investments” plus “cash
at bank, on hand and on interest bear-
ing deposits” totalled £1,575,000, or
about 42 p.c. If the paid-up capital of
the business was split up roughly on the
same basis, we could have a sweet-manu-
facturing company with a paid ordinary
capital of £A615,000, which, even after
paying a £10,000 preference dividend,
would be earning £230,000, or about
373 p.c. on capital. On the other hand,
we would have an investment company
with a paid ordinary capital of about
£446,000 earning about £44,000 or 9.8
p.c. on capital.
investment company would have a
net asset backing of about 17s. 8d.
per 5s. share, and the sweet manu-
facturing company about 14s. since it
would have the bulk of the liabilities of
James Stedman.
From these figures, it can be seen
that the sweet company would be con-
sidered a reasonable investment on the
basis of the net asset backing and earn-
ings per share — especially if a 20 p.c.
dividend was paid. I doubt whether the
shareholders of the investment company
would be very happy with the low
return on assets employed and might
well think that they could do better with
these funds if they were in their own
hands. Maybe this is how James Sted-
man’s shareholders feel now about the
company’s investment portfolio. They
might well ask sometime why the com-
pany continues to hold such large assets
which are surplus, apparently, to the
business of making sweets.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
To Have and to Hold
The continuously expansive Gibson Kelite
iy|ELBOURNE-BASED Gibson Kelite In-
dustries divides its activities into
four categories. In each it is both a
manufacturer anc distributor of consid-
erable success. The ss. shares are cur-
rently fetching about 13s. 6d. on the
market and yielding 3.7 p.c. from the
well-established 10 p.c. dividend after
brokerage. This is a fair price for those
who are looking to the long-term. How-
ever, to anyone seeking something better
than steady dividends over the next two
years, the price may look a little high.
The group's basic activities nest in the
production of chemicals. It is soundly
established in this field and came to the
public lists in November, 1960. with more
than fifty years experience under its belt.
Eight of the 15 subsidiaries carry the
bulk of the business, producing a large
number of items ranging from industrial
chemicals to toilet tissues, ink and ad-
hesives. The industrial range is sold
mainly to industries using metal —for
decarbonising, degreasing, steam clean-
ing, rust prevention, general treatment
and paint stripping.
Sanitation chemicals involving all sorts
of germicides, liquid waxes, soaps and
deodorants, synthetic detergents, disin-
fectants, chemical polishes, sterilisers,
antiseptics and insecticides are turned out
too. Household items like drain cleaners,
sand soap and snail killer are on the list,
as well as chemicals used on turf and
bowling greens. A sterile sector of the
business indeed! it is hard to fathom
why the directors include their Stephens
and Simpsons inks and office adhesives in
with the chemicals group, but they do.
fT'HE second sphere of activities is em-
A braced by the engineering products
group. Fou rsubsidiaries operate here,
with production divided basically into
two areas. The Orm Smith companies
manufacture electric and briquette hot
water units for the home, as well as all
types of industrial hot water and heating
equipment, heat exchangers, calorifiers
and boiler feed equipment. Cleaning and
processing equipment is another valuable
line, covering things like stainless steel
tanks and vats, reaction kettles and dis-
tillation equipment.
The third area is covered by Com-
mando Products, an acquisition made
only a few months ago and after the close
of the 1963-64 financial year. This sub-
sidiary concentrates on water softeners
and filters for the home and on similar
items for industry, including deminerali-
sation units. It sells all over Australia
and to New Zealand and is the leader in
its home State of SA.
The glass group covers the remaining
three subsidiaries. Its nucleus is the
T. S. Gill companies, which were taken
over in 1962-63, resulting in the big
boost to paid capital set out in the accom-
panying table. Gill, based in SA too,
is a glazing contractor, glass merchant
and shopfitter. Apart from the higher
earning rates resulting from the acquisi-
tion, capital profits made through the
selling-off of unwanted assets at the time
of takeover have left the Kelite group
with substantial cash, which it intends to
use for expansionary purposes. The
Commando takeover was financed by
these funds.
HThe final category involves no sub-
A sidiaries as such, although many of
those already mentioned are affected by
it. This is the group’s overseas business,
affiliations and associations. Jeyes Ltd is
the UK licensee for Kelite floor treatment
materials and a number of related pro-
ducts. St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of
England, “Daily Mirror” building and
the London Hilton Hotel are among the
better known customers boasted by Jeyes.
At the November annual meeting (al-
ways a well-attended affair with food and
liquor turned on) shareholders were told
that a “new and important affiliation” had
been negotiated with the Oxford Chemi-
cal Corporation, of Atlanta, which would
“play a significant part in sales develop-
ment”. (Oxford manufactures several
chemical specialties which would be
suited to the Australian market.) Ex-
plaining further, chairman Gibson said
the Kelite group would receive formulae,
patents and technical assistance to manu-
facture these products. They will be new
to the local market.
Apart from these tie-ups, royalty-
licensing arrangements are held with
Federal Division of Enterprise Manufac-
turing and the Kelite Corporation, two
American companies which have been
minority shareholders in the group.
Kelite is a leading manufacturer of in-
dustrial detergents and metal finishing
chemicals, while Federal is one of the
most prominent makers of floor main-
tenance materials. The local company
has the full use of their patents, formulae
and trade names as well as the benefits
of their technical research and develop-
ment.
It is an undisputed fact that the com-
pany is engaged mainly in the production
of items which still have an expanding
market. The only thing barring its growth
in the years ahead will be competition,
which directors are well aware of and
well prepared for. This is why the shares
are really good buying for the long-term.
One to buy and put away for about five
years if possible, and then there will
really be some profits to gloat over.
Anyone who bought the shares when
they were first listed in late 1960 would
already have doubled his cash on the
market price alone. There have been no
shareholders’ issues or dividend changes
since then. Before Christmas that year
they were going for between ss. 6d. and
6s. 6d. This year they have been as
high as 14s. 3d. The directors’ firm
policy of expanding only when increased
earnings will be the result should keep
prices on an upward trend if success is
as good as it has been to date. Earning
rates have risen steadily every year, de-
spite big jumps in paid capital and the
curses of the credit squeeze.
Results for the current year will rise
considerably with the inclusion of the
Commando profit—this takeover was
made without any addition to paid capi-
tal. The new chemical sales branch in
Brisbane will be operating for a full 12
months. Completion of a chemical plant
at Revesby, near Sydney, will facilitate
growth in NSW and Queensland. Addi-
tions are planned for this factory and for
the one at Cheltenham (Vic.). The
group still has funds available for further
expansion, so there is a chance that pro-


HELP
LEGACY
all the year round
fits will see another source of betterment
before June 30 rolls round again.
Now, the nagging question is why,
with such a brilliant past and such a
rosy future, have shareholders seen no
issue and no dividend lift? Since 1960,
earning rates have risen from 13.6 p.c. to
19.4 p.c. and this year they will be very
close to 25 p.c. Reserves have grown
from £32,000 to £317,000, fixed assets
from £347,000 to £579,000, and loan
capital from £195,000 to £350,000. Why
have shareholders not shared in this
growth? Why are they not being asked
to share in the growth which is due this
year, and the year after too, most likely?
HThe answer lies in several areas. First,
the company has had no need for cash.
Reserves, although they have grown well,
have not warranted a bonus issue. Work-
ing capital has never been lacking and
the Gill takeover actually left the firm
with more money than it knew what to
do with. Second, taxes to date have
been well below normal levels, thanks to
investment allowances, export benefits
and pre-acquisition losses on the books of
some subsidiaries (expected to last about
another three years). Directors no doubt
saw merit in making provision for the
days when these benefits would be less-
ened or no longer theirs. Shareholders
may have suffered ultimately if increased
dividend commitments happened to see
a very narrow cover once such benefits
petered out.
Far and above both these ideas is the
hard, cold fact that, in December, 1965,
paid capital will jump from the present
£541,000 to nigh on £650,000. In that
month, options issued to unsecured note-
holders and for takeover purposes will be
maturing, convertible into shares at par.
There is little doubt that every one will
be exercised.
The new capital will rank for the final
six months of 1965-66. However, in-
creases between now and then should en-
sure that earning rates remain around
and most likely above the 20 p.c. level.
Such being the case, there seems to be
a certain amount of stinginess in the
directors’ no-issue policy. The fact that
there was no shortage of liquid cash may
also be more important than it appeared
at first glance. On the other hand, it is
extremely wise to prevent counting
chickens before they hatch. Directors
have been wise, even though underesti-
mating the success of their company, in
avoiding a situation which may have
proved embarrassing if expansion had
not been so rewarding to date.
Having regard to this cautious past, it
would be logical to assume that no issue
will be made until the earning rate posi-
tion on the extended capital is clear. This
should take about two years and this
is why genuine buying should be made
with the object of hanging on. Possibly
the best time to buy will be December,
1965, when all the options mature and
depress the market temporarily. On the
other hand, this eliminates the neverthe-
less likely possibility of an issue between
now and then. Such a move could be
made, providing the directors feel that
the future is as good as this column does
and providing they are prepared to count
their chickens to some excusable extent.
The table reflects in figures the suc-
cess which the company has enjoyed
since listing. There is nothing particu-
larly startling about it except for the
healthy growth trend in everything from
the fixed assets to the share price. Net
tangible asset backing for each share has
risen over the years from 5s. Id. to
7s. Id.

FENWICK HOLDINGS LTD
On the Waterfront
"C'enwick Holdings Ltd maintained a
A tradition of having its tugs handle
all the important ships that visit Sydney
Harbor when several of its vessels were
used to bring the giant aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise to its anchorage in Athol
Bight.
During the war years the company’s
tugs handled the Queen Mary and the
Queen Elizabeth, and in 1963 assisted in
the docking and sailing of the Royal
Yacht Britannia.
Although Fenwick’s history goes back
more than 100 years to the times of the
sailing ships, its history as a public com-
pany dates only from 1958 when 100,000
ss. shares were placed with the public
at par.
Paid-up capital at this stage was only
£150,000. Growth has been rapid and
capital now stands at £400,000, all in
ordinary shares. Issues include a 2-for-5
at Is. 3d. premium in 1960, a l-for-3 at
2s. 6d. premium in 1962, and a 3-for-7
bonus in 1961.
The company at present operates a
fleet of eight tugs in Sydney, Botany Bay,
Newcastle and Port Kembla. Four are
steam tugs, which are gradually being
replaced, and four diesel tugs. A fifth
diesel tug was launched in July and is
due to come into service shortly. Work
has begun on another vessel, due to go
into service about the end of next year.
The fleet appears in the books at
£981,295, which includes tugs at 1948
valuation of £24,000 each. Against this
total book value, directors have created
a depreciation provision of £264,787,
giving them a net book value of
£716,508. However, over and above the
depreciation provision, a reserve for
increased cost of fleet replacement has
been built up to £250,000.
The accounts show that at balance date
of June 30, £214,166 has been paid on
the new tug, M.T. Iron Cove, which was
launched in July but was not due for
commissioning until the end of the year.
Building of the new tug will be aided
by the Federal Government’s decision to
extend the shipbuilding subsidy to vessels
exceeding 200 tons gross, compared with
the 500 tons gross previously This new
tug qualifies for the subsidy.
The shipping industry is not con-
sidered to be highly profitable, par-
ticularly in Australian ports. Fenwick
has proved an exception to the rule.

sistently high, giving a substantial cover
to the dividend requirement.
Following a setback in 1962, when
profit fell to £90,680 (equal to 22.6 p.c.
on capital increased by a share issue),
profit has gradually increased to
£105,542 (26.4 p.c.) in 1963, and last
year to a record £131,357 (32.8 p.c.).
Following the capital increase in 1962,
dividend was cut from the 12i p.c. paid
since flotation to TO p.c., which was held
the following year. Following last year’s
improvement, the rate was again restored
to 1 2} p.c.
Although profit has given g wide
coverage to the dividend for each of the
past four years, directors have appropri-
ated £50,000 from earnings to the fleet
replacement reserve. With the shipping
subsidy now applicable to tugs of the
company’s size, such large provisions
may not be necessary in the future,
leaving the way clear to higher dividends
or some form of capital benefit.
The company is particularly strong in
reserves. Capital reserves have stood for
several years at £100,000 —sufficient for
a one - for - four bonus issue without
placing the dividend payment in jeop-
ardy. General reserve stands at £200,000,
while surplus profit is £94,768. Subject
to an intangible item of £175,000, net
assets backing of each 5s. share is
10s. lOd.
The shares have touched a peak
27s. 6d. during the year and a low point
of 17s. 6d. At present they have eased
to around 22s. 9d.
This is probably due to the general
weakness in the market, for the water-
front shows no sign of slackening. Should
the price fall much below 20s., the shares
should be worth buying even if only for
the long-term benefits.

The Reduced Portfolio
Real virtues in the present holdings
■poLLOWiNG last week’s dramatic
change, the portfolio in its much
reduced form now consists of:
200 Eric White
500 Conquip
500 Treloar
500 Kolotex
2000 Westralian
500 Anderson Meat rts
500 Automotive Components.
Most of the above stocks are only part
of the original holdings. The other odd
15 stocks have sadly gone their way.
Some such as Hanimex, and more lately
Aberfoyle Holdings, showed good profits,
while others, including Pioneer Sugar,
registered losses.
A few people may seem to regard this
mass selling as a cruel trick on anyone
following this column. As emphasised
last week, though, the decision arose
simply because I wanted to reduce the
portfolio. If it serves as any consolation,
I would be very happy still to be holding
all those stocks except, perhaps, Pioneer
Sugar. And the only reason for my loss
of confidence in that stock is the storm
damage caused to the crops on the north
part of Queensland last week. Alas, also,
the world sugar price continues to fall.
So much for actions past. Now what
about my present holdings?
Eric White at about 20s. seems unduly
low for a company that could earn close
to the 50 p.c. mark this year. One
broker has been partly successful in his
manipulation of the market and at one
stage had the price down to 19s. 3d.
Once the stock gets over its present blues
its price should be very much higher.
Conquip fully satisfied my hopes for
the 1963-64 year with a 22 p.c. earning
rate: Yet its price of 9s. 6d. also seems
depressed.
Treloar is the veteran of the present
portfolio, having been around for the
best part of six months. Now that it’s
being mentioned in the same breath as
Protector Safety Industries, we could
see the price top the 20s. mark.
Kolotex’s share price survived the
battering it took following the resigna-
tion of two Melbourne directors. With
calmer waters in front and the likely
prospect of a generous bonus issue, these
shares make a pretty sight at 15s.
Westralian shares at 3s. have the great
virtue of being available to everyone.
(So too, I suppose, does. Chevron.)
Ilmenite might not be as spectacular as
some of the other metals, but it is making
very nice headway.
Anderson Meat rights have shown
little life during the current l-for-10 par
issue. In fact they are a little below my
purchase price of Bs. The market can’t
let go unnoticed the remarkable recovery
of the company nor its very good
prospects, especially when measured
against the 33 p.c. increase in beef pro-
duction in Australia so far this financial
year.
Automotive Components is really the
only true speculation in the group.
Caught up in the throes of takeover
fever, the price could go either way.
Although there’s no money in the
kitty, it hasn’t stopped me from adding
to the portfolio. My action in buying
50 New Broken Hill seems to be showing
contempt for my penniless state. After
all, at 1265., this is just about the most
expensive share on the market. Then
again, it deserves to be.
Last year when the combined lead and
zinc price was £stgl4o, the company
managed to earn 128 p.c. on capital.
Now, with the combined price at
£stg277, the earning rate for the financial
year ending this month will be knocked
haywire. Earlier this year I made an
estimate of 200 p.c. for the earning rate.
Now I think it will be closer to 300 p.c.
Helping this latest prediction is the fact
that royalties are not to exceed 50 p.c.
of net profits.
A bonus issue must be on the cards,
especially since CRA has made a 3-for-
-10 bonus. CRA has wide interests, but
its 32 p.c. shareholding in New Broken
Hill will probably prove the most spec-
tacular one this year.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
How to Become a Shearer
“Closed shops” on the way out
fpHE shortage of shearers in Australia is
a bit like the shortage of doctors.
Somehow the supply of new practitioners
coming forward never quite catches up
with demand. Consequently those who
are already shearers (and doctors) do
rather well.
Observers who sometimes suggest that
these are contrived situations are angrily
denounced —by shearers and doctors—
for their churlishness and cynicism. Well
that may be.
Leaving the case of the doctors to those
better qualified, this writer now proposes
to take a closer look at the shearers’ lot.
All things considered, shearers have
never had it so good.
A “prosperity bonus”, extracted during
the boom years of the early ’fifties, has
been retained by incorporating its bene-
fits into the general award. (The wool-
grower, having no award, no longer gets
the prices he got in the early ’fifties.)
In pre-war days shearing was largely
a seasonal occupation. But today, those
shearers who are prepared to travel
around the country can get work pretty
well throughout the year. This has been
brought about by the virtual revolution in
sheep management methods since the
war, with pasture improvement, autumn
and spring lambing, and mid-season and
off-season lambing.
There are still peaks, of course. It is
safe to say, though, that there is some
shearing going on somewhere throughout
the 12 months of the year.
In their new award, the shearers are
asking for a rate equivalent to a mini-
mum of £6B a week. This is the mini-
mum base. An experienced man should
have little difficulty knocking out his
£lOO a week. Facilities on the stations
have improved vastly also. Shearing
these days is an occupation offering better
prospects than most skilled trades.
How does a lad become a shearer?
Well, it is not altogether easy to break
in.
Shearers operate as individual mem-
bers of fairly casually organised teams.
The head of the team secures the sheds
and makes the arrangements about when
shearing shall begin.
Most of the teams are made up of men
who know each other and who have
worked together before. The lack of
young learner shearers is not altogether
the fault of the shearers themselves. Very
few graziers want their sheep shorn by
learners, who might cut them badly and
otherwise knock them about. The boss
of a team, therefore, likes to accommo-
date the grazier (who could get some
other team if he wanted to) by assuring
him that his boys are all experienced
shearers who will do a first-class job.
Most of the young shearers these days
are sons of small property owners or
small property owners themselves. They
learn on their own sheep, or sheep be-
longing to their father or some other
relation. Thus the system excludes many
youngsters, without family contacts, who
would like to be shearers.
Some shearers, naturally, say the
system has stood the test of time and
should not be tampered with. Others
believe the shortage is likely to get worse,
could seriously hamper the industry’s
efforts to increase wool production, and
could eventually react against all shear-
ers.
The Australian Wool Board is making
a worthwhile effort to improve the situ-
ation. It is not often, unfortunately, that
the Wool Board tells the world about its
more effective workings, compared with
the spate of misinformation churned out
on the generally doubtful wool promotion
issue.
It is not difficult to shoot holes in wool
promotion as the Wool Board, and the
International Wool Secretariat, envi-
sage it. It has been a muddled, amateur-
ish and incredibly expensive business
right from the start.
That part of the Wool Board’s re-
sources given over to improving shear-
ing is small, compared with promotion.
In the long run it may very well do more
for the industry.
Only a couple of weeks ago, Wool
Board chairman Sir William Gunn an-
nounced that four additional shearing
field officers would be appointed to ex-
pand the Australia-wide Tally-Hi coach-
ing service. The only training course for
learner shearers planned at present by the
Board is at Broken Hill in early Decem-
ber. There will be instruction schools in
all States next year.
Sir William explained that since the
Tally-Hi method was introduced in
August, 1963, the Board had employed

two field officers to demonstrate and
explain it. More than 120,000 men, in-
cluding shearers and prospective shear-
ers, had attended these demonstrations
and 20,000 instruction charts had been
sent out to others inquiring about Tally-
Hi.
The Wool Board believes that most
benefit can be obtained by coaching
young shearers who are capable of shear-
ing 40 to 90 sheep a day. These shearers
are usually referred to as improver-
shearers. At this stage the Board appar-
ently feels that there are enough im-
prover-shearers about who ought to be
given a chance of becoming fully-fledged
shearers.
Coaching of raw novices is being
looked at, yet the best immediate result,
it is felt, will come from coaching the
improver-shearers. In time, courses for
raw novices may be established.
The Board has had admirable co-
operation from both the Australian
Workers’ Union and graziers prepared
to provide pens for improver-shearers.
Next year’s campaign will devote more
attention to shed courses, as distinct from
public demonstrations.
All this seems well thought out and
likely to get results. The Tally-Hi
method is rapidy becoming accepted as
the best method of shearing sheep. It is
not really a revolutionary method, rather
a rationalisation of many tried and pro-
ven methods adopted over the years by
the famous “gun” shearers. It works,
which is what matters, and the training
programme now getting under way
should work also.
It may never be all that easy for young
men to break into the shearing game.
The “closed shop” attitude, however,
seems to be on the way out.
A Pardon for Canned Meats
Overcoming the Aberdeen scare
THhe Argentine is not the only one of
A Britain’s canned-meat suppliers to
have suffered from the suspicion that fell
on it earlier this year, when authorities
said they thought the Aberdeen typhoid
outbreak came out of a tin from a fac-
tory on the River Plate. Despite the
world-wide meat shortage and a general
expansion of trading in canned meats, the
Aberdeen scare has depressed consump-
tion of these products in Britain. Along
with other suppliers to the market, which
takes 111 b. of canned meat a head a
year, Australia is feeling the effects.
The Aberdeen outbreak was traced
tentatively to a 61b. tin from a line of
Argentinian catering beef. Trading in
this field has been hit so hard that one
big wholesaler even now is selling only
10 p.c. of his usual volume. The retail
market, handling smaller cans that are
branded, has also suffered. Merchants
find that consumers are now rejecting
cans for having torn labels, small dents
and other irrelevant blemishes that would
not have mattered before.
Soon, however, an official report on
the typhoid outbreak and its origin is due
to be published. Many in the meat in-
dustry are tipping that it will show that
Aberdeen’s health officials spoke too
hastily and that the germs responsible
came not from The Argentine but from a
carrier in the town itself. This would
signal a resumption of the expansion in
canned meat trading that has occurred in
the last decade. When it happens Aus-
tralia will be in a position to benefit.
For a time, the development of the
United States as an outlet for Australian
manufacturing beef reduced the amount
available for canning. With that market
now circumscribed by a quota treaty
between the two Governments, a revival
has taken place in canned meat produc-
tion and the general postwar pattern of
trade is returning.
For Australia, part of this pattern has
been the whittling down of the multitude
of brands that stormed the market 15 or
20 years ago to a mere three or four
today. The departed include bandits who
did well out of selling canned gristle and
water to captive consumers during the
British food rationing and did much to
identify Australia with the gastronomic
indignities of those times. With their
weeding out and the expenditure of much
promotional energy, most of the stains
have been erased from Australia’s name.
Its canned meats —typhoid scares apart—
are now at home in shopping baskets that
have always been open to its canned
fruits.

In exporting canned meat to Britain,
Australia has had not only to live down
its sins of the past but at the same time
keep up with standards that have con-
tinued to rise. This rise will advance
another step when quality regulations are
introduced by the British Government
next year. The importers of the largest
Australian retail canned meat pack to
reach the British market (Tom Piper),
amounting to about half a million 40-can
cases a year, say the new standards will
impose no overall difficulty on manu-
facturers, but simply disqualify a few
non-Australian importers who are now
lagging.
Australia’s chief competitor in com-
parable canned meats is Britain herself.
Her livestock production advanced so
much in the agricultural renaissance
beginning in the last world war that she
can now devote large numbers of stock
to canning. United Kingdom output last
year was a record 79,000 tons.
Competition in canned meats also
comes from products that do not corre-
spond with Australian lines—such as
tinned pigmeats from Holland, Denmark,
Poland and Yugoslavia. Within the can-
ned meats scene, demand today is turn-
ing away from the solid packs like
corned beef and ox tongue to more inter-
esting concoctions that have been born
into the ever-widening family of canned
meats in the last few years.
The supermarket boom has not stimu-
lated canned meat sales so much as the
layman might think, partly because tech-
niques in the presentation of fresh meat
in these establishments have kept abreast
of those of canned meats —a fact that
would seem to lend weight to a recent
statement, reported in Britain, by Sir
Frederick White, chairman of CSIRO,
that Australia’s rural exports would de-
cline unless she met overseas demands
for processed or manufactured foods and
that the growing preference for pro-
cessed foods was having an important
bearing on research.
Another change in the composition of
the canned meat pack stems from the dis-
covery of Japan's appetite for mutton.
Four years ago, meat-canning consumed
about equal quantities of beef and mut-
ton. Since then, Japan has taken such
large amounts of mutton that today
hardly any is going into tins, although
Irish stew, a composite product with
mutton as the meat component, stub-
bornly survives. The canned pork that
is reaching Britain in growing volume
from the Continent used to be dearer
than beef. Prices of the two meats are
today about the same.
Public preference is such that in open
competition between the two as cold
packs, pork tends to win. This means
Australia must put more emphasis on
hot packs like stewed steak, beefsteak
in gravy, Irish stew, and steak and
vegetables. Fortunately, the industry is
so constructed that such adjustments are
not too hard to make.
Canned meats are among the items
featured in Australia’s increasingly am-
bitious food promotion programme in
Britain. A facet of the activity that is
not so conspicuous as others has lately
taken place in the form of a letter that
has gone out to schools, canteens and
other institutions which went cold on
canned meat after the Aberdeen affair.
Without referring to Aberdeen, the letter
describes the skill and cleanliness that go
into the processing of Australian canned
meats and tries to engender confidence
that will help the products off to a good
start when the clearing-up of the typhoid
mystery restores trading to normal.
More Nitrogen Fertilisers
Two oil refineries plan the equipment
VTitrogen fertilisers seem certain to
become more readily available to
Australian farmers as a result of de-
velopments in the petroleum industry.
Ammonia, the basis of the nitrogen fer-
tilisers, is a by-product of oil refining
and the special equipment needed is
being planned for at least two refineries
in Australia those at Kwinana in
Western Australia and Pinkenba in
Queensland.
The three main types of fertiliser
made from ammonia are ammonia
sulphate, ammonium nitrate and urea.
Liquid ammonia is also a fertiliser and
in this form is used a great deal in the
United States. It is applied in two ways
by injecting the ammonia direct into
irrigation water and by injecting it into
the soil.
The decisions to go in for nitrogen
fertilisers at the Kwinana and Pinkenba
refineries have been doubtless influenced
by the large - scale land - development
“Wool certainly looks better on her than it does on you."
schemes in the west and in Queensland.
The long-term prospects should be
good, as it follows that intensive farm-
ing requires more and more fertilisers.
A likely side-effect will be increased
activity on the part of Australian farm
machinery manufacturers, who will be
able to supply the equipment needed for
the application of the new fertilisers.
