Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
'63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the ’63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this year’s reasonable price
and in the light of possible
future shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying ’64
now, you gain some 20 to
30 cents a bottle each year.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

MELBOURNE
Psychedelic
underpants give a
man assurance
AS YOU KNOW, we are a very
decent, honest, TAB-robbing people.
Mostly we insist on being tucked up
in bed by 9.30 p.m. Many citizens
over the years have tried to give us a
fine, cosmopolitan, worldish nightclub,
but none has ever really succeeded.
Now our one late-licence club, Ciros,
has closed. The auction was a melan-
choly affair, the two plaster Grecian
columns went for $25, the six cham-
pagne buckets went for $6O, and the
1000 yards of champagne-stained bur-
gundy carpet fetched $l5OO.
The proprietor, Mr. David Silk, said
if his licence had been 6 p.m. to 1.30
a.m. instead of 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. he
might have made a go of it. But, he
said, the nightclub business the world
over was in bad shape. The disco-
theques had ruined the trade.
Now the ruin in Melbourne is further
complete. Lo, we have a genuine
psychedelic discotheque. It opened in
Little Bourke Street last week, and the
outside of the building is tastefully
painted in yellow, orange, green, and
purple stripes. The discotheque is run
by three Monash University students,
but the brain behind the psychedelic
bit is Frank Eidlitz.
Eidlitz is an old hand at startling
the local citizens. He was the first to hit
us here with “op art.” He won one of
the first Churchill Fellowships, went to
the U.S. and returned as our top
apostle to psychedelic art. He made a
marvellous film called “Raga Doll,”
which showed moving patterns on a
naked dancing girl. This was smartly
impounded by the Customs.
Frank Eidlitz says that psychedelic
art is totally different from op art.
Op is all geometric and clever, a trick
to the eye. Psychedelic art is a total
assault, with color, moving images, fleet-
ing patterns, swirls, globs, the lot. The
] dea is to give you the trip without
taking the drug.
I beg your pardon. Nobody, includ-
mg Mr. Eidlitz, likes any mention of
LSD. He says people seize up immedi-
ately, although he admits this fnay be the
best way to explain it. However, the art
is a logical development and would have
come LSD or no LSD.
He says all America is crazy about
the psychedelic art thing. It has hit
New York like a bomb. It’s in all the
clothes. One can even buy psychede-
lic underpants. Normally other people
can’t see your psychedelic under-
clothing, but it is a comfort to know
that you are switched on under-
neath.
He says it is in the ads in the glossy
magazines, and they do it particularly
on TV for cigarette commercials.
There’s one for Winston cigarettes
which is made up of a dozen split color
images which are constantly changing.
No doubt this is to give an idea of
total enjoyment; one is taking a trip
when smoking a Winston.
There are psychedelicatessens and
little gifty shops .all around New York
where they sell psychedelic cuff-links,
psychedelic posters (these are terribly
in, you must have one for your wall),
paper-weights, diffraction jewellery,
and way-out bits like hookahs, incense,
and bells.
The opening of the Ginza, for that
is the name of our Melburnian psyche-
delic discotheque, took place at 10 p.m.
on a Friday.
It was seething with people. Apart
from bodies there was nothing inside,
no clutter of furniture. It was in total
darkness and in one corner there was
a group belting out psychedelic-type
music. Frank Eidlitz had six projectors
“Can I have the next trip?”
in action throwing images on all four
walls and ceiling.
Frequently images overlapped other
images. One moment there would be
a full-length woman lying right along
a wall. In a fiftieth of a second it
would be gone, replaced by swirling,
frantic, paisley globs of color and
light. Then there would be a bit of
street, almost, a scene, a face, gone,
then something else.
The patterns also fell on the dancers,
on the band, on everything, so all that
hit the eye was psychedelic and there
was the shrieking assault of the music
in the eardrums.
Frank Eidlitz came up and shouted:
“This is supposed to expand your
mind, make you feel elated. Flow does-
it strike you?”
“Pardon?”
“How does it strike you?”
“I feel queasy,” I said. “All this
moving stuff is making me sick in the
stomach.”
“Marvellous, marvellous,” he shouted
back. “This is good. It is affecting
you.”
It was affecting others also. In the
gloom with everyone in sweaters and
tight pants, it was difficult to tell one
sex from another. But I was told that
among young people the spirit was
the same as with crocodiles
although they looked identical, a young
boy crocodile could always pick a girl
crocodile by instinct.
And looking carefully I noticed a
couple in a corner in a passionate
instinctive psychedelic embrace. The
visual trip was affecting them just
fine.
Just after the opening of the Ginza
we had another opening of a nice
night’s entertainment, Noel Ferrier’s
“Bubble ’n’ Squeak” music-hall restaur-
ant at the Triaca’s. Here they have a
very polished stage show with perform-
ers like Jill Perryman, Frederick Pars-
low, and lan Turpie. They have all the
Yorkshire-style recipes like Bubble ’n’
Squeak, Toad-in-the-hole, Bangers and
Mash, and Steak ’n’ Kidney Pud, pre-
pared by a fine olde English cook, Mr.
Giovanni Seraglio.
The waiters wear waistcoats made
of Union Jacks, and one presumes
that when the tip is not large enough
the flag is worn upside down.
There is also the dish, fish and chips.
If one wants them wrapped in genuine
newspaper then the charge is 10 cents
extra. Although one regretted to note
that the newspaper was Melburnian
and not English.
On opening night there was a great
scurry among the waiters and Union
Jacks as the guests were leaving. They
were told that under no circumstances
were they to take (away the menus.
We discovered later that they cost $5
each. Even then eight got away.

OUT AND
ABOUT
Qualified delights:
honeymooning in
the never-never
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
ROBIN SMITH he does those
coffee-table travel photographic books
that sell so well walks in with two
Aboriginal watersticks and says on no
account mention where he got them
because if they’re stolen the native
he paid $l6 to may be killed.
He and his wife, Patricia, have just
returned from a year-long, 35,000-mile
working honeymoon around and into
Australia. Neither feels too well, and
both look extremely pale. However,
Mr. Smith has 3000 photographs for
his sixth book, and Mrs. Smith has an
opal which was given her by a well-
wisher in Coober Pedy, and a stewpot
she bought in Alice Springs which
cooked enough for five days, during
which time she sat in the jeep with her
feet on the lid to stop the gravy run-
ning out. She also has an Adultery
Stick. The adulterer can choose between
receiving a blow on the back of the
head, or pushing the stick right through
the calf of his leg till it comes through
the other side. This is for men only.
They probably kill the women, suggests
Mr. Smith, his face settling into mourn-
ful optimism.
Actually, things have changed since
Mr. Smith’s last trip to the interior
two years ago. Things are looking up
for the native, almost commercialised.
Well, where once 20 cents satisfied him,
now he expects anything from 40 cents
to $l.
As for bartering with beads, that
idea is practically Stone Age. Good hard
cash is the only thing a native under-
stands and even then, when a deal’s
done, no one says thank you. The
money goes into their pockets without
so much as a bat of an eyelid.
Mr. Smith pays a set rate of $4 a
day, plus keep, for modelling, and on
top of that supplies the props, such as
woomeras and spears. They don’t seem
to have their own any more these days,
he says, looking even sadder. With these
conditions you’d think the market pretty
good for modelling; but here again the
natives have gone to seed. They are
getting flabby, in fact, because of lack
of exercise. Mr. Smith says you can t

ask a native to pull his stomach in;
firstly he won’t understand, secondly
he wouldn’t know how.
He did find one handsome creature,
though, called Albert. Part of the
attraction was his wonderful beard.
Albert, says Mr. Smith, I take pictures. I
pay you two pounds money. Albert says
he play football. Mr. Smith says he meet
when sun is two feet over. Albert,
sadly, end drunk in jail. Mrs. Smith
is just parting with $lB bail when she
remembers prisoners are shaved. Albert
stays in jail.
Nevertheless, Mr. Smith took some
beaut pictures. There is one of Mick, a
magnificent specimen of aboriginality,
bone through nose and all crouched
(to disguise his sagging stomach) read-
ing a copy of “Playboy.” Mr. Smith
stuck two woomeras in front to sym-
bolise rabbits’ ears —that is, Bunny
Girls —and when Mick opened the
magazine he shot to his feet and rushed
to his friend Pombie, who said in good
old Indian Colonel English “Goodness
me!” Mr. Smith can’t think where he
learnt it. The pronunciation was so
accurate.
There is also an Aboriginal who
believes that white man thinks of
nothing but his genitals and makes a
habit of appearing as a sort of tourist
attraction dressed in shirt only. Ladies
alighting from charabancs are very
distressed at this and send him trousers
by the ton, which he then sells.
Mrs. Smith had her moments, too,
what with being propositioned in
Perth, looking her absolute worst,
covered in dust and hair hanging every-
where, but she says on the whole men
in the outback, the real hard stockmen
characters, are more charming than
men in Sydney. If anyone swore in front
of her they’d be upset and apologise at
once.
She cannot say, however, that the trip
was devoid of marital argument. After
all, it did last for a year. She and Mr.
Smith had a hum-dinger at Great Fitz-
roy Crossing, and for two pins she
would have walked out —excepting there
was no aeroplane for three days and
only the Great Sandy Desert to walk
out on.
However, it’s an experience she’ll
never forget. They took it in turns to
drive along the Nullarbor, 100 miles at
a time, and she nearly died, her arms
ached so keeping the steering wheel
straight.
She also blew someone’s stove up; it
took three days to clean the mess away,
and south of Darwin a 10ft. King Brown
snake nearly got her. She was lying
there exhausted when it slithered up and
if Robin hadn’t leapt on it she’d . . .
It was, says Mr. Smith, very poisonous.
Mr. Smith’s fans will be pleased to
know that his book comes out in Sep-
tember, and anyone interested in
e mulating his trip should set aside
$15,000, which, says Mrs. Smith, in-
cludes $1399 —and 80 cents —for petrol.

ANGOVE’S FINO DRY SHERRY
MARION RAYMOND'S
COOKBOOK
And to think it all
started with "take
two dozen eggs..."
SOME PEOPLE collect stamps, some
collect shells. Others collect matchboxes
or ashtrays . . . almost everyone seems
to collect something. As you are reading
this article, it is safe to assume that
you are interested in food . . . and
more than likely you also collect recipes.
On the markets of the world are
literally thousands of books dealing with
food. Some of them are good, some
indifferent, and some make you wonder
how the publishers ever had the gall
to print them in the first place.
The other day I received a copy
of Robert Carrier’s cookbook, “Great
Dishes of the World.” The new paper-
backed version, published by Sphere
Books Ltd., is available now in Austra-
lia for the small sum of $1.55. A very
sound investment. This book contains
all the recipes printed in the original
hard-cover book costing almost six
times as much and is superbly illus-
trated.
Once more I marvelled at his know-
ledge. He is not one of those people
one so frequently meets who re-
christen traditional recipes. He has
travelled extensively, sampled the dishes
of many countries, and experimented
with them in his own kitchen. The
results of his experiments are passed
on to you without errors of quantity
or content and with the addition of
some very sound advice.
As he says, whenever you try a new
method of cooking, do not be disap-
pointed if you are unsuccessful at the
first or even second attempt, but try
to find out the cause of failure and
remedy it the next time.
I own a fairly large library of cook-
books perhaps more than some
people because I have a professional
interest in food as well as a good appe-
tite. If you are planning such a lib-
rary, you may be interested to know
which of my books are the most dog-
eared, and thus, obviously, the most
often read.
Almost the bible of anyone interested
professionally in food is the famous
“Larousse Gastronomique.” It is not
the sort of book you pick up because
you want to experiment with something
new. It is a dictionary of cookery. Its
contents are authentic historically, the
ingredients listed foolproof. But it’s
not the sort of book you want to read
to work up an appetite.
Size for size, and almost as expen-
sive and impressive, are the American
“Gourmet” books. These are more
readable, in my opinion (because I like
a lot of white on my pages!), and much
more likely to tempt you to try some-
thing new. The recipes contained in
these books are also authentic, but
written in a simple style, which makes
them easy to follow.
The trend in today’s cookbooks to
list the ingredients before the recipe
does not appeal to me at all. I want to
be tempted by a recipe in the first
place, not frightened away from it by a
long list of ingredients. I am inclined
to think that anyone who wants to cook
is not stupid. If, after reading the
recipe, onp wants to make it, it’s not
difficult to get all the required ingredi-
ents together and then follow direc-
tions.
But, of course, I have heard of people
who begin a recipe and, when halfway
through the preparations, discover that
the most important ingredient of all
is absent from the larder shelf. The
lesson here is that you should keep a
good larder in the first place.
I have lots of “fun with food” books,
which I have either bought myself in a
weak moment or been given as presents.
They usually make good reading once.
But the recipes rarely inspire me
sufficiently to make them part of my
repertoire.
The “travel” type of cookbook I
prefer. “Blue Trout and Black
Truffles,” one of the many books
written by Josef Weschberg, sat on my
shelf for many years until some
wretched acquaintance “borrowed” it.
But it was used so often that I can well
remember the delicious recipes, and it is
only the rereading of this fascinating
book that I miss.
Even Alice B. Toklas (whom I in-
stinctively dislike because of her asso-
ciation with Miss Stein of whom I
don’t approve at all) at least left
something worth while on her depart-
ure. A history of their joint eating
habits . . . not as valuable, perhaps, as
their joint collection of paintings, but
it is nice to know that they enjoyed
themselves sometimes. Not at other
people’s expense, but at their tables.
(“The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book” is
available as a Penguin.)
Then there are books that combine
travel in out-of-the-way places with des-
criptions of food in local restaurants.
Recipes that make you wish you were
there . . . some of them are good enough
to transport you there.
But the most dog-eared books in my
collection are Elizabeth David’s “French
Provincial Cooking” and her “Mediter-
ranean Cook Book.”
The print is too small and there
aren’t any glamor color photographs,
but the recipes given, from the most
menial ragout to the most fascinating
fish dishes, are all worth making again
and again.
No stomach, in my opinion, should be
without these books.


Look who’s taken over from King Neptune...
Now aluminium rules the deep by force of its strength,
versatility, and resistance to corrosion!
When the R.A.N. wanted twenty new
vessels for patrol work around
Australia’s northern coastline and
Pacific Islands, it had a problem.
What metal to use in the super-
structure? The metal had to be light,
strong, and as near maintenance-free
as possible. Aluminium was the answer.
Besides being light and tough, an aluminium
superstructure gives the vessels a lower
centre of gravity, which means greater
stability. And because of aluminium’s
extraordinary corrosion resistance,
maintenance is practically nil.
Being constructed in Queensland, each vessel
will be 107 ft. long witfr a2O ft. beam,
and will incorporate more than 3.5 tons
of aluminium in the superstructure, funnel
casing, and fittings below deck.

ONE MORE
WEEK
Occasional wear
A NEW SALON for the Sydney firm
“Formal Wear” opened in Melbourne
last week. Here you can hire anything:
wigs, mink jackets, tiaras, morning
suits. One of the more interesting items
is ball-gowns for pregnant ladies. The
proprietor, Mrs. Levy, said this was an
important service because no mother-
to-be wanted to waste money on a ball-
gown.
Mrs. Levy admitted also that they
had wedding-gowns for pregnant brides.
The folds of white satin fell very taste-
fully from the bosom. She suggested
that there was slightly more call for
them in the Sydney business than in
Melbourne.
Narrowing it down
A GROUP OF SPORTSMEN, seeking
sponsorship to go overseas to compete
in an international contest, have now
discovered that, ideally, they should be
over 25 so that their exploits can be
underwritten and later, perhaps, used
in advertising, by cigarette companies,
but under 26 so that they can take
advantage of cheaper air fares offered
by airlines to people in that bracket.
Boots and all
EVERYTHING was highly organised
at the Ascot race meeting in Britain last
week so that attendants could differen-
tiate between knickers and mini-dresses,
trouser-suits and culottes, and turn
away those in offending categories.
Things are more simple in Sydney. A
woman wearing a knee-length dress
and coat was turned away from a Syd-
ney club a few nights ago. “No boots
here, lady,” she was told.
Indigenes
WHATEVER happened to that good
old world “native?” Somewhere along
the way to 1967 someone decided that
New Guinea native was belittling or
confusing (after all, there are white
New Guinea natives by now) or both.
So up came indigene for the darker New
Guinea natives. Some call it indigenes
and some, more correctly, rhyme it with
“jeans.”
We can’t say that to our mind it
saves any confusion. A Press release this
week told us that a senior officer from
Papua-New Guinea Army headquarters
would visit a number of N.S.W. centres
ln a bid to interest indigenous students
studying here in an Army career in the
Territory. (We think they were refer-
ring to Papua-New Guinea natives
studying in Australia and not Austra-
lian natives studying here). But what
really assaulted the eye was the heading
“Indigenies sought.” And to think that
the officer is looking for potential
“well-educated indigenous officers.”
Welcome mat
YOU HAVE TO HAND it to the
Americans; they have the welcome busi-
ness down to a fine art. The U.S. Am-
bassador, Mr. Ed Clark, arrived back
in Canberra last week to be met at
the airport by a throng of 50 Embassy
staff and children. Mr. Clark lit up like
a Christmas tree, and moved among the
crowd with a “Howdy,” a “Nice to be
back" and a pumping handshake.
Howdy from Ed to Harold
A short time later Prime Minister
Holt arrived back in Canberra from
his three-week trip overseas. He was
met by a straggle of Pressmen, two
Air Force officers, and an official of
the British High Commission.
But Mr. Clark did the right thing.
He stuck around to build up the num-
bers for Mr. Holt’s welcome to the
national capital.
Without strings
THE BEST-SELLING “Quotations
from Chairman Mao Tse-tung” may
be Communist China’s most spectacular
cultural import to this country but it
is certainly not the only one.
The Chinese make violins more
cheaply than anyone else and Austra-
lian dealers have been quick to take
advantage of the fact. The violins are
mostly sold to schools. A complete kit-
violin case and bow can be bought
for $2O or sometimes less.
Most Sydney music stores seem to
stock stringed instruments from Com-
munist China, althought not all seem
prepared to say much about it. At
the mention of the word China, the
woman at A. E. Smith’s looked guarded.
Why Smith’s she wanted to know. They
didn’t import theirs direct as some
other music shops did.
Well, could she suggest anyone who
might talk to us about Chinese violins?
Why the Chinese, was her next ques-
tion. People all over the world made
violins, she said. Yes, but the fact that
Chinese violins were being played in
Australia sounded interesting. The
Chinese made them as well as anyone
else, she said.
Well, what sort of wood did the
Chinese use in their violins, we asked.
Proper wood. What was proper wood?
She wasn’t going into that. There were
whole books written on the subject, she
said. Go to the Municipal Library.
All right, but could she help with
the name of the Sydney agent for the
violins? She didn’t know if there was
an agent, but Mr. Naylor in Castle-
reagh Street might say more, although
she didn’t really think he’d be pre-
pared to talk, either.
But Mr. Naylor was quite happy to
talk. He emerged from the back of his
shop and picked up a violin which was
on display.
“There are quite a lot of Chinese
violins and ’cellos around,” he said.
“The woodwork is very good because
the Chinese have always been excellent
cabinetmakers. But we have to restring
all the instruments we get from them.
A lot of people don’t, but we do. The
Chinese, of course, have a different kind
of music from us and somehow their
strings never sound right.
“But that’s all that’s wrong with
them. They’re usually made from Asi-
atic timber, although some have Ger-
man wood in them, and they’re cer-
tainly good enough for beginners. The
French and Germans still make the
best violins because it’s a craft which
is handed down from father to son.
But there’s nothing to touch these in-
struments at the price. No one, not even
the Japanese, can do it.
“And the schools are much more
likely to go on teaching the violin
now that they can buy a kit for $2O
instead of the $4O they had to pay be-
fore. Yes, we import direct. It’s a bit
complicated, but we manage.”
Straight to the heart
SINCE MAY East-West Airlines
have been running a flight direct to
Alice Springs from Sydney once a
week. They call it “A Town Like
Alice” tour and promise for $262 nine
days that your heart will never forget.
One thing that in the past most people
from the Eastern seaboard never forget
about Alice Springs was the immense
fatigue involved in getting there,
whether by air or bus, with unneces-
sary and time-wasting stopovers.
On July 29 East-West are offering
racing enthusiasts a special flight to
the Alice Springs Gold Cup, a festive
affair arranged by the Central Aus-
tralian Racing Club, which holds 60
race meetings a year. The tour has
been carefully scheduled so that punters
don’t miss the midweek races or the
commencement of the Spring Meeting
at Warwick Farm.


MICHAEL BAUME WRITES ON
THE
ECONOMY
Doing a deal with
Japan at
the UK's expense
GOOD OLD DE GAULLE! By being
beastly to the British over their efforts
to join the Common Market, he has
enabled Australia to do a bit of healthy
bartering with the Japanese. We are now
flogging off to the Japanese the right to
enter our market on the same terms the
British have had. In exchange we are
getting a much bigger quota of meat
exports to Japan and guaranteed duty-
free access for wool, coal, iron ore,
skins, and hides. If de Gaulle had
sounded even a bit friendly to the
British, then the end of British prefer-
ential tariffs in Australia would have
been automatic when Britain went into
Europe anyway, and we would have
had nothing to barter with. But now
that the matter is very much open to
doubt (as the Economist so delicately
put it, Britain may have to wait to get
in over de Gaulle’s dead body if it can-
not manage to do so over his live one),
then the special concessions we allow
the British in our markets are a very
useful bartering tool in our talks with
the Japanese.
So we now seem to be giving some-
thing very worthwhile away to the
Japanese by saying to them that if they
give us some benefits, we will remove
the considerable tariff advantage that
British goods at present enjoy over
Japanese ones. After all, what have we
got to lose? The preferences would have
gone sooner or later (and we give
Britain far more than we get out of it,
anyway).
The British are giving us away in
trade, even without the Common
Market; and once they get into it the
rules will not allow them to have this
sort of special deal with the Common-
wealth.
The goods the Japanese particularly
ALAN REID IS ON HOLIDAYS
want to get in here on the same terms
as the British are synthetic textiles and
a large list of machinery items which
is still being settled.
All this emerged out of the Kennedy
Round, in which Australia offered
tariff concessions on 3300 items in ex-
change for reciprocal rights in other
markets. These Japanese arrangements,
soon to be signed, are the first bilateral
deals arising out of Australia’s decision
at Geneva not to join with all the big
industrial nations in cutting their
tariffs in half, but instead to come to
specific deajs. (Nevertheless, the $lOO
million of our manufactured exports
going to non-British countries will bene-
fit from the lower world tariffs on
manufactured goods even without our
having to offer anything in return.)
Last week’s announcement by the
much embattled Minister for Trade,
about the Japanese arrangements
stressed their importance for meat, say-
ing they had “opened up much better
opportunities for the increase in our
meat exports to Japan.” At present they
are limited by quota for beef and are
subject to duty for mutton and lamb.
Last year, Australia provided about
7500 tons out of the 10,000 tons import
quota Japan allows from all sources,
and we sold about 15,000 tons of mutton
and lamb (on which the duty is now
to fall).
Winning this meat concession in
Japan is very important indeed, par-
ticularly as another significant meat
deal the Department of Trade had
hoped to cook up with the Common
Market has fallen through. This could
have been one of the biggest advan-
tages to come Australia’s way out of
the Kennedy Round (even as significant
as the new wheat price agreement) had
the Argentinians (who were handling
the negotiations alone, for some reason)
been able to pull off a deal that would
benefit all meat suppliers, including
us. And of course, there is also the
need for something nice to happen to
the meat industry after the recent prob-
lems posed by the drought and by the
continued attempts by some U.S. pro-
ducers to impose more severe import
quotas on Australian beef. In
addition, next September sees the end
of the 15-year Britain-Australia meat
agreement under which a British market
has been guaranteed. The Common
Market bid must put “paid” to that one.
IT’S JUST AS WELL the Govern-
ment is salvaging something in Japan
from the Common Market situation,
as it has failed to do anything about
this threat in the \\ years since General
de Gaulle rejected Britain’s last appli-
cation. True, Australia’s trade with
Japan has jumped ahead since then,
but the Government can take no real
credit for the fact that we have found
(and are exporting) all that iron ore,
bauxite, and so on.
It is absurd for Mr. Holt to keep
on restating the meaningless phrase that
Britain has said she will safeguard the
“essential interests of the Common-
wealth.” Who is going to define “essen-
tial”? The British will have a different
view of the essential nature of the
Queensland sugar industry, for ex-
ample, from that of Mr. McEwen and
his Country Party associates. But sugar
is only part of the story. At present
Australia sells Britain about $4OO mil-
lion worth of goods under preferential
conditions which may not seem
much out of total Australian exports of
$3 million or so. But all these $4OO
million are in only a few products and
Britain is the major market for them
(and whole communities depend on
their export).
Yet the Government continues to
point proudly to the fact that in the
past five years the proportion of Aus-
tralia’s exports going to Britain has
fallen from 24 percent to percent,
and to regard it as an example of how
Australia has used the breathing space
to change its trading patterns and pro-
tect itself from a subsequent British
move into Europe. The realities are
that our exports to Britain have sub-
stantially increased, and that it is only
the build-up of exports to other
countries that has reduced our propor-
tionate dependence on Britain. In most
of the products that we sell in quantity
to Britain we are now more dependent
on the British market than ever before,
beef, butter, fresh and canned fruit
and sugar.
A few weeks ago Dr. Cairns quoted
some startling details of the deepening
dependence of some Australian com-
modities on the British market. These
are listed in the table on this page.
On top of that there is the heavy
dependence on British capital, not only
in Australian stock markets but also in
direct investment in companies and
on Government loans. Last year British
direct private investment in Australian
companies totalled $250 million (a
major factor in our balance of pay-
ments). And after that there is $250
million of Government borrowing to
mature in Britain in the next five years
($5OO million over the next ten), and
if Britain goes into the Common
Market there may be little chance of
getting that renewed.
And what is the Government plan-
ning to do about this? No one knows.
But it is a fair bet that Cabinet offers
up a few prayers for the health and
long life of President de Gaulle before
sitting down to its sessions at which the
Government decides to do nothing
about the Common Market problem.

IF YOU COULD
AFFORD AN
IBM TYPEWRITER
YOU'D SAVE
SO MUCH MONEY
IBM Electric Typewriters have always cost a little more.
IBM puts more into its typewriters. That's why you get
so much more out of them.
Take the IBM type ball, for a start. A completely new
concept in typing. Only IBM has it. The type ball works
faster than any type-bar system. (This means more work
can be completed in less time with even less fatigue for
the typist.)
The IBM Typewriter can change faces. It takes a typist
two fingers, and five seconds, to change the type ball —
in mid-sentence if she wants. You can get sixteen type
faces all for the one typewriter. You get IBM's superior
engineering abilities. The research and technical know-
how that put IBM ahead in the computer field applies
in our Office Products Division too.
Our typewriters not only perform better, they last longer.
IBM Typewriters are so far
ahead ... tomorrow's type-
writer today. Call and ask

AUSTRALIA
John McEwen and the search
for Mr. Big
AFTER PRIME MINISTER Holt had
walked across the tarmac of Mascot
Airport and entered the, terminal build-
ing, on his return from his international
journeying, he was taken aside by
Treasurer McMahon.
The two talked in a VIP room and
only emerged after ten minutes. The
PM’s Press secretary announced to as-
sembled reporters that Mr. Holt would
only answer questions on his overseas
trip.
It was no wonder he did not feel
like discussing domestic affairs since
the principal news of the week was the
recurrence of conflict within the coali-
tion.
“When the Prime Minister is over-
seas, one thing is for sure,” said one
Liberal. “You can bet Jack McEwen
will cause some trouble.” And he cer-
tainly did this time. In two violent
speeches the Country Party leader hit
fiercely at critics of his tariff policies
and those who have said that he is
betraying his country supporters by
excessive protection for city industry.
Grasping almost every word of abuse
in the political lexicon, he delivered
two tirades: one in Sydney, the other
at Coff’s Harbor. In Sydney at the
119th convention of the Australian
Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council, he
accused the president, Mr. T. Walker,
of having been taken in by a “earn-
paign of false propaganda designed to
poison people’s minds . . . waged against
me and the Country Party.”
A group “unseen and unknown, its
members faceless and nameless, very
rich indeed and very reckless in misrep-
resentations,” had initiated the cam-
paign. They had “hired writers to
slanderously misrepresent the facts on
tariffs and to attribute the whole respon-
sibility to me and my Party.”
“This,” he declared with all the in-
dignation he could muster, “is a new,
bad, and sinister appearance in the
Australian democracy.”
The “Basic Industries Group,” it
turns out, hardly deserves the credit
Mr. McEwen gives it for making poli-
tical movement. Set up just before the
last elections it published advertise-
ments urging farmers to vote Liberal
rather than Country Party in five elec-
torates where there were three-cornered
contests. The group was centred on a
grazier who was once a Country Party
Member of Parliament but had drifted
away from the Party because it was
championing manufacturers interests.
He and a handful of his mates threw
Mr. Holt: only questions on the overseas trip
in money and worked through a Sydney
representative, Mr. R. Chapman.
By all accounts and Mr. Mc-
Ewen’s followers have provided no
evidence to the contrary the group
has been inactive since the elections.
What has really troubled Mr. McEwen
has been the post-election criticism of
his tariff policy by a diverse collection
of peoples and organisations: the As-
sociated Chambers of Commerce; for-
mer Tariff Board chairman Sir Leslie
Melville; present chairman Alf Ratti-
gan; the Graziers’ Association of
N.S.W.; the Australian Wheatgrowers’
Federation; leading journalists, and
Government backbenchers, and the
Labor Party.
He may be able to persuade some of
the simpler souls who attend Country
Party conventions that it is all an awful,
underhand conspiracy, by a handful of
subversive graziers, but for the com-
munity at large it is likely to look
more a desperate exercise in scare-
mongering, reminiscent of some of the
late Sir Earle Page’s outbursts.
Mr. McEwen came very close to
accusing the Liberal Party of involve-
ment in the conspiracy when he claimed
that the group intended to “destroy the
Country Party in favor of the Liberal
Party” and declared: “This is the most
clearly discernible campaign on party
political lines that 'I have ever seen.”
Complicity
This was more clearly developed in
reports coming out of Canberra. In the
coy language some daily papers em-
ploy “some Country Party members”
wanted to have a “senior N.S.W. Min-
ister” disciplined for his supposed com-
plicity in the plot. In plain English
they were trying to say that Mr. Mc-
Ewen’s deputy, young Doug Anthony,
was telling journalists that his Party
colleagues were saying that the Treas-
urer, Mr. McMahon, was involved in
the campaign and should be stopped by
the Prime Minister.
The whole suggestion was rather
ridiculous because whatever Country
Party Ministers might like to do to Mr.
McMahon, they have nothing on him.
He (together with other Liberal Mini-
sters) is known to be vigorously opposed
to the tariff policy Mr. McEwen has got
through Cabinet. He is known to be
concerned that the Country Party is
using its control of the Trade Depart-
ment to win favors from manufacturers.
He has spoken privately to a number of
organisations expressing his disquiet. But
he has given no public indication of any
of this and so has maintained Cabinet
solidarity quite scrupulously. He has


John McEwen ... 367 foolscap pages
done nothing for which he could be
criticised, let alone disciplined.
The only specific thing Mr.
McEwen’s people bring against Mr.
McMahon is an alleged close relation-
ship with Canberra journalist Mr. Max-
well Newton, who happens to be one
of the most virulent critics of Mr.
McEwen’s policies.
Weaknesses
The difficulty Mr. McEwen has
landed in stems basically from the
factual weaknesses in what he says. Mr.
Walker, he claimed last week, was
“utterly untrue” in saying that Aus-
tralian representatives had abstained
from the main function of the Kennedy
Round, which was to cut tariffs and
increase trade. “Here is the list of
items which we furnished to those who
wished to negotiate with us • 367
foolscap pages, listing more than 3300
items on which we offered to negotiate
tariff concessions.” He neglected to say
that the concessions he offered were
mainly to abolish British preferences,
selling off part of the British share of
the Australian market.
For the rest he was prepared to
lower tariffs which are above the levels
needed to protect Australian industry.
In no case was he willing to negotiate
in the spirit of the Kennedy Round,
offering other countries the oppor-
tunity to compete for a larger share
of the domestic market with Australian
firms. He said as much at a Press con-
ference in Melbourne on his return
from Geneva: “No fields of Australian
manufacturing industry which are pro-
tected will have any essential tariff
protection reduced at all.”
Mr. McEwen also attempted at Coff’s
Harbor to refute the argument that his
tariff policies have been a cost burden
for farmers. He quoted the case of three
chemicals which have fallen in price
recently, a case which looked rather
unconvincing when someone pointed
out that all three were obsolete weed-
killers, going out of use. His critics were
also able to go back and find Mr.
McEwen’s own admission of the effect
of his policies; for instance, in a speech
before the last elections, “the (tariff)
policies which encourage factories put
a burden of cost on the farm. I’ve never
run away from saying that I am sup-
porting policies which tend to put a
burden of cost increase on the farm.
But I then follow and say, if this is a
proper thing to do, then it is a proper
thing for governments to offset these
cost increases ... we do offset them.
Dairying is one of the industries in this
district. In the days of my Government
we have already paid $5OO million to
subsidise butter and cheese produc-
tion—” which is not much consolation
for basic rural industries like wool,
meat, and wheat.
It is not only tariff policy which is
worrying leading people in the Liberal
Party but Mr. McEwen’s continued
success in expanding rural industries
which must eventually retrench in the
face of contracting markets overseas.
Sugar, dairying, and tobacco are the
main cases in point. There is also
bitterness with the Trade Department
for its failure to negotiate a reduction
in the duty the U.S. imposes on wool.
The Americans asked only that we
should offer in return improved access
for their tobacco, a deal many think
should have been immediately accepted
in the national interest.
There is also great disappointment
that the arrangements for selling off-
season beef and veal in the EEC have
fallen through, a fact which Mr. Mc-
Ewen casually let drop at the Wool-
growers’ meeting. The scheme was
negotiated by the Argentine, but the
principle of multilateralism meant that
we shared in the market opportunity it
opened up. Trade Department officials
said privately a fortnight ago that they
thought the off-season beef was potenti-
ally a more important gain than the
floor price for wheat.
Future?
In Canberra last week there was
broad agreement that Mr. McEwen was
reflecting deep concern for the future
of his Party in the coalition. Mr. Ader-
mann must soon relinquish the Primary
Industry portfolio because of his age,
but there is no good Country Party
candidate available to replace him. Mr.
Barnes in the Territories portfolio
hardly inspires confidence. His “if-ever”
statement on New Guinea independence
was widely used in anti-Australian
propaganda in the Afro-Asian world.
His general style is regarded as patron-
ising and colonial. And most recently
his attacks on New Guinea political
parties are being criticised. There are
suggestions he should be replaced by a
more modern Liberal.
The future place of the Country
Party in the coalition after the retire-
ment of Mr. McEwen is increasingly
coming into question, with a surprising
number of Liberals talking in terms of
taking away from the junior partner
the Deputy-Prime Ministership.
Tensions in the coalition are also
likely to be aggravated by an article in
the “Australian Quarterly” by the
N.S.W. secretary, Mr. Carrick. He
refers to three-cornered contests in
which Liberals stand against Country
Party candidates as being well estab-
lished and successful, and speaks of the
growing expertness of the Liberal Party
in rural matters. Which statement Mr.
McEwen might reasonably take as being
a call for the Liberal Party to move
into greater competition with his Party
in its electoral strongholds in the
countryside.
The Senate
Near-miss
“THE FACT IS that we are doing here
what the people of Australia expect us
to do” —the apt classification of the
special Senate meeting called by the
Opposition last week (to disallow regu-
lations for increased Post Office
charges) by Labor’s portly Deputy-
Leader in that chamber, Senator Sam
Cohen, of Victoria.
It is now history that Labor, lean-
ing heavily on the unpredictable sup-
port of the two DLP Senators, Gair and
Senator Gair. .. swayed
McManus, and Independent Turnbull,
threw the regulations out, costing the
Government something between sls
million and sl7 million (Mr. Holt’s
own estimate) in revenue.
But, apart from the packed Press
gallery and the unusually large number
of 13 spectators in the public gallery,
it took the august Senate only 15
minutes after Senator Murphy’s open-
ing “This is an historic occasion” to
resurrect its traditional air of somnam-
bulism.
Admittedly four Government Min-
isters and seven Government Senators
could not be tagged as contributing to


this state of affairs they had de-
parted for parts unknown by then.
“ The final analysis of the day is in-
teresting. Labor’s Senator Murphy, a
Q.C., lost badly when he gambled that
fear of public condemnation would
carry the day—and the DLP votes —
for him in his plans to deliver a second
rebuff to the Government by having
a Senate Select Committee appointed
to inquire into medical costs.
He overlooked the wrathful cussed-
ness of ex-schoolmaster Frank Mc-
Manus.
The Opposition set the stage early
in the one-day sitting when they refused
to support the DLP attempt to move an
urgency motion allowing discussion on
the Post Office being turned into a
statutory authority or commission like
the ABC. Murphy himself, after a
caucus meeting the previous night, had
dismissed the DLP plan as a “gim-
mick.”
When the call came for the urgency
motion, only Gair, Turnbull, and a
highly embarrassed, red-faced McManus
rose in their seats. They needed a total
of five to proceed. McManus, looking
squarely at Murphy, said, “And I
thought this was Labor policy.”
By late afternoon the lobbies were
buzzing with reports that the DLP was
not going to support Labor’s move for
the Select Committee. Labor relays
soon conveyed the word to Murphy, and
before the evening session began a
strange series of conferences involving
Murphy, Cohen, McManus, Gair, and
Turnbull took place.
Murphy reportedly wooed and won
the Turnbull vote, is reported to have
also swayed Gair —but McManus dug in
and demanded that Labor pay for the
slap they had handed out hours before.
He had his way, and he and Gair
remained seated when the final division
scraped through.
Airlines
Thinking bigger
WITH THEIR DC9s starting to arrive,
Australia’s domestic airlines are prepar-
ing for a “think bigger” phase. The
first development was TAA’s installation
of a Boeing 727 jet simulator in Mel-
bourne, due to go into action this week
after acceptance trials; and the airline
has a DC9 simulator on order.
Earlier it had been said that Aus-
tralia’s domestic airline industry was too
small to use simulators, but although
the initial cost is high ($1 \ million), the
savings should make it worthwhile. The
aircraft imitator will help cut pilot
training costs, and doubtless will be
used also by Ansett-ANA and the De-
partment of Civil Aviation.
At present, pilots converting on to
Boeing 727 s spend 12 hours in the air
ht an empty 727 getting the feel and
sequence of it. The direct operating
cost of the aircraft is something like
$l2OO an hour, not counting the loss
of passenger revenue by having the air-
craft off-line for the training time. The
simulator should help change that.
The pilots will still get in-flight train-
ing, but the simulator could take over
almost half the 12 hours’ conversion
time —and at something near half the
operating cost and no loss of passenger
revenue. The simulator really gives the
feel of the real Boeing. It rolls and
pitches, the stick pressure feels the
same, instruments create the conditions,
and the computer feeds' in the right
noises, even to the screech of the tyres
on landing.
TAA also has installed a computer
to handle passenger bookings in Mel-
bourne, and Sydney’s bookings will soon
be added to its work. It will reduce the
error factor to almost nil. The airline’s
cadet pilot scheme, outlined in these
pages last week, is now under way with
12 cadets instead of the original 11.
(Qantas, too, is ready for a second
intake of cadet pilots and began adver-
tising for them last week.)
Prices
The net result
WHILE RETAIL advertisers, as ever,
stress “save” and “savings,” the Con-
sumer Price Index moves on as steadily
as any upward-bound escalator. A rise
during the March-June period is be-
coming traditional, and no relapse is
expected when the figures come out this
month. And more and more rises
beyond.
In the quarter to March, the Con-
sumer Price Index showed prices rising
an overall 0.4 percent in Australian
captial cities. The biggest increases were
recorded in fire-stricken Hobart, where
prices rose equivalent to 70c on a weekly
wage of $5O, and in boom-town Perth
by 50c.
Bread prices increased in five State
capitals, and milk went up in Hobart.
Fares increased in Hobart and Canberra,
beer rose in Adelaide, third party in-
surance in Perth, and motor-car regi-
stration was higher in Brisbane and
Hobart.
Throughout Australian capitals
housing costs continued to rise, as did
clothing and drapery. Only the cost of
household supplies and equipment fell.
The 15 percent increase in the whole-
sale price of sugar announced last week
will lead jams, canned fruits, biscuits,
confectionery, ice-cream, soft drinks,
maybe even beer, on to the escalator.
Because world prices for sugar ex-
ported outside long-term agreements
have slumped, Australian consumers
must support the sugar grower.
Although the position of world
markets is the reverse in meat, the net
result is the same; the consumer never
wins. Overseas demand for beef and
veal has put pressure on domestic prices,
and veal reached record levels in Sydney
in April.
Higher wine prices are being deter-
mined apparently by what the public
can afford to pay rather than by costs.
Public company vintners have earned
splendid profits, but the wine industry
seems inspired by the thought that Aus-
tralian wines on quality have been the
cheapest in the world.
The $1 a week Federal wage increase
granted early in June will have the in-
evitable repercussions throughout in-
dustry, despite the Treasurer’s ex-
hortations to absorb the rise. The
N.S.W. Premier hinted at tax increases
to cover the State’s higher wage bill.
And that brings us all to the question
—the Budget and taxes?
Western Australia
Whitlam debate
ON PAPER, THE July 7 West Aus-
tralian conference of the Australian
Labor Party should be a sounding-
board for the contentious issues that will
be thrashed out at the Federal Con-
ference in Adelaide the Wyndham-
Whitlam party reforms, Vietnam, State
aid. If the conference had taken place
a year ago it might have been; but since
then the State, secretary, Mr. Joe Cham-
berlain, has recovered from his illness
with all his guile and whip-cracking
ability, and any major deviation from
the Chamberlain line is unlikely.
On Vietnam and defenc’e, only one
motion gives pro-Barnard people even a
chance to get their toe in the door
and force debate. Mr. Chamberlain anti-
cipated that he might not be able to
control State conference as well as ho.
can control State executive, whom he
called together on June 12 when dele-
gates were committed to his purist line
on Vietnam. This was soon after the
“Joe” Chamberlain.. . back in power


deputy leader, Mr. Lance Barnard, had
suggested a revised line on Vietnam
might be necessary, and Mr. Chamber-
lain had attacked him for this re-
visionism (to be attacked, in turn, by
Mr. Whitlam).
State conference will not be the place
to find out whether he wins or loses
this debate. Western Australia, Victoria,
and Queensland line up together in
Adelaide and no debate certainly
no changed party policy is likely
from the Adelaide conference.
There is some slight room on July 7
to manoeuvre on the party reform
schemes with about a dozen motions
coming forward to back, in some de-
gree, the call for reorganisation of the
party structure and hierarchy; one
watery motion even comes from the
University branch, usually aligned with
Mr. Chamberlain’s Left Wing of the
party. But there is little hope, even if
such a movement gathered backing, that
it would se,ek to have power given to
the parliamentary wing at the expense
of the party machine.
Quite simply, there is no real opposi-
tion to Mr. Chamberlain. About one-
third of the conference numbers will, at
heart, be against what he stands for,
but they have no real leader yet. Mr.
Joe Berinson, who in the West Aus-
tralian context is called a Right-winger
but who is probably farther Left than
most Australian Labor people, is being
looked to for this confrontation in time..
The recently formed John Curtin Club,
sneered at as a “Right-wing Fabian
Society,” is emerging as a force in
counter-balance. But, as a newcomer to
the West’s Labor politics remark e.d,
“there’s such a tiptoey attitude”; in
other words,, Joe is firmly back in
power.
Meat
Werribee bulls
THE MELBOURNE BOARD of
Works runs a sewage farm about 16
miles from the city at Werribee. On
28,000 well-irrigated acres it raises
just about the best beef cattle in the
business.
Most valuable among its 11,000
pure-bred cattle are 18 Hereford bulls
and 60 Aberdeen Angus bulls. Last year
these sturdy sires begot 5000 progeny.
Despite their prime quality, since
1949 State Government regulations
have prohibited sale of stock from the
Board of Works’ farm except for im-
mediate slaughter for home consump-
tion. The reason usually given for the
restriction is the risk of sewage-farm
stock contracting beef measles and
passing on tapeworms to consumers.
The influential Graziers’ Association
of Victoria recently re-emphasised this
danger, and, aware of moves to relax
the 1949 prohibition, declared that the
release of the Werribee cattle for gen-
eral trade could seriously affect Aus-
tralia’s overseas markets.
Final rebuttal was supplied soon after
by Mr. G. G. E. Fewster of the Depart-
ment of Primary Industry in Mel-
bourne: that extensive surveys now
showed that far more beef measles cases
occured on private farms than on sew-
age treatment properties.
The case for relaxing some of the
prohibitions is now before State Cabi-
net and a sub-committee will present its
finding this week. A decision will fol-
low shortly. The betting in Collins
Street is that at least the Werribee bulls
will be made available to private
breeders.
The RAN
Coast patrol
AUSTRALIA LOOKS LIKE get-
ting a semblance of a Coast Guard.
At the height of Sukarno’s confron-
tation Australia and Malaysia realised
their navies needed small patrol boats to
combat the new type of infiltration-war
Indonesia was waging. The Australian
Navy promptly ordered 20 long-range
patrol boats.
The first of these 100-ft. ships are
now coming into service with the
R.A.N.; but confrontation has ended
and with it the need for fast
patrol boats. Apart from stationing five
at Manus Island, the rest will now
operate from Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney,
Jervis Bay, Melbourne, and Perth.
Among other things, such as crew
training, they will perform Coast
Guard type activities.
The Minister for Customs and Ex-
cise (Senator Ken Anderson) gave the
first hint of this last week when he
revealed that the Navy had agreed to
assist Customs officers in anti-drug
smuggling patrols. Naval authorities
confirmed later that apart from this
the patrol boats would perform search
and rescue and fisheries protection
work.
Australia, with one of the biggest
coastlines of any country in the world,
is sorely in need of some type of
Coast Guard. Apart from the obvious
necessity of search and rescue work,
local fisherman are anxious about other
countries encroaching on our fishing
preserves. Customs officials, too, are
keen to step up off-shore patrols to
combat the smuggling of narcotics.
Naval authorities say the new fast
patrol boats are ideally suited for this
type of long-range patrol work, and
can do it much more cheaply and
efficiently than the bigger naval ships.
A destroyer on Coast Guard work
would tie up some 350 men, but the
small patrol boats carry a crew of 15.
The Army
Fighting vets.
THE AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY
Association is jousting with the Aus-
tralian Army, which seems unwilling
to do battle with an unhorsed oppon-
ent, whose first tilt has been contemptu-
ously thrust aside by Army Minister
Fraser.
Jilted, the AVA would like it known
that the Army has failed to appreciate
that in modern civilian life vets are no
longer “horse doctors” but custodians
of health both in human and animal
populations. In Vietnam, however,
American Army vets see to it that their
men and ours are not fed infected food.
Also, modern armies are making in-
creasing use of dogs for guard duty,
patrols, tracking, and locating land
mines.
With the constant coming and going
of troops between Australia and disease-
ridden countries we should be taking
special care not to bring back ailments
which could ravish our huge and highly
susceptible animal populations.
Well over 100 animal diseases can be
transmitted to humans. Returning
troops could carry pestilence. Our
troops in the Middle East in the last
war were in danger from rabid dogs
until one of the soldiers, who happened
to have been a vet in civilian life, recog-
nised the symptoms.
With crowning insult uninten-
tional, no doubt the Minister did
offer to find some clerking posts for
vets in the Medical Corps. Clearly,
from the example just given they could
serve their country better. All the vets
want is to be given an opportunity to
use their special training to contribute
to national defence.
The AVA believes veterinary corps
could help ensure the health and com-
fort of troops, establish animal health
services in conquered territory to sal-
vage as much as possible in the ensuing
chaos, and stand guard against the pos-
sibility of bringing human and animal
diseases home with the Army.

Victorian ALP
Loyalty probes
THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL of the
Left-wing-dominated Victorian Labor
executive, “Fact,” in its latest edition
accuses Mr. Gough Whitlam of making
“some intemperate and ill-advised re-
marks” while pledging support for
him at the same time.
The general editor of “Fact” is Mr.
Bill Hartley, secretary of the Victorian
Labor Party. His journal expressed its
editorial views on Mr. Whitlam’s sting-
ing attack on the Victorian State
executive at the State Conference on
June 9, smack in the centre of a front-
page article headed “Pledge to fight
on: Support for leaders.”
The article quoted, Victorian ALP
president Brown that, as elected leader,
Mr. Whitlam was entitled to be sup-
ported and that was what the State
executive would continue to do.
“Mr. Brown said the leader, as a
Party member, was entitled to express
his views at any State conference and
delegates could weigh the value of his
observations.
“Mr. Brown said that, as responsible
Party members, both Mr. Whitlam and
himself recognised that differences could
be resolved and crystallised into a
degree of unanimity which could com-
mand the respect of the people.”
But in editorial comment on the
same page, “Fact” said that some of
the members of the ALP Victorian
State executive and other trade union
officials had been subjected to a
“loyalty purge” reminiscent of the worst
days of anti-Communist hysteria in the
’fifties.
“Fact’s” editorial said the loyalty
probes were made by legal men with-
out any material provided in substantia-
tion. It said the purpose of the exercise
was to produce a penalty along the
lines of making it extremely difficult if
not impossible for these people to sur-
vive in an active Labor Party and trade
union role.
“Many members of the ALP will
protest vigorously against the vicious
practice of questioning a man’s loyalty
on such grounds as that he is a member
or an official of a trade union which
has Communist officials.
“To regard such an orientation and
such activities as evidence of Commun-
ist sympathies was one of the crudest
errors of the loyalty probers we saw in
action last weekend. It was an error
which may result in telling scars on the
fabric of the Labor movement.
‘The malicious testimony of frus-
trated office-seekers and the intolerance
and religious sectarianism which, un-
fortunately, marred some of the ex-
changes at Conference have no real
place in the Labor movement.”
COMMENT
New Guinea —the
seventh State?
WHEN A NEW GUINEA politician buttonholed Territories Minister
Barnes at Lae Airport and demanded a referendum in Australia on New
Guinea becoming a seventh State, Mr. Barnes at first refused to give
him an answer, then said the next day: “For the time being it would not
be a feasible proposition.” However, as a result of Mr. Barnes’ previous
refusals to give an honest answer to similar questions a political move-
ment has already formed which is based on the idea of Australian State-
hood as a better practical ultimate aim for New Guinea than complete
independence.
Since no one in the Australian Government had the remotest intention
of urging the acceptance of New Guinea as an Australian State, why on
earth didn’t the Government come out and say so earlier? Perhaps
because it seemed expedient not to give a definite “no”: it at least kept
the natives quiet for a bit longer by holding the issue in cold storage and
thereby frustrated the growth of the independence movement by a month
or two.
On various issues a “cold-storage policy” by that very name has
for long been a concept in Canberra thinking. Its most disastrous expres-
sion was the complete failure of our policy on West New Guinea, where,
as it turned out, “ostrich policy” would have been a more accurate
term than “cold storage” to describe what happened. A similar policy
of deliberate evasiveness toward East New Guinea could rebound with
results unfortunate for Australia.
The soundest objections to the idea of New Guinea as a seventh State
are not based on questions of race but on questions with which many
of those who are racially tolerant also agree. To add New Guinea to
Australia would be to make it our third largest State. This would
almost certainly in effect place the Government of Australia in the
hands of the people of New Guinea. If they formed political parties of
their own, these parties would hold the balance of power; if they
adopted our own parties and favored one of them consistently, that
party would govern; alternately, to gain power, the present parties would
have to outbid each other in gaining New Guinea support. By absorbing
two million New Guineans into Australia with their entirely different
social and economic status we would also have to tear up almost every
existing Australian institution.
It might be argued that shocks of this kind would do us good, that
by the tensions they would create they would liven us up, destroy the
obsolete, force us into new definitions and initiatives, thereby making
us quicker in our reflexes to the problems of the part of the world we
live in. It doesn’t matter whether this argument is true or false. The
point is that a nation which is as cautious as Australia is, for example,
on immigration reform, simply would not be prepared deliberately to
invite tensions. Given this fact, Mr. Barnes should have been more
specific in honestly destroying any false hopes that have been growing
in New Guinea.
Formal fraternal relations between peoples can be institutionalised by
methods other than Federal union. If political leaders in New Guinea,
when they begin bargaining for independence, are still interested in main-
taining some other special relationship with Australia they should then
put up their ideas. But how can there be political leaders if, as Mr.
Barnes suggested, the Territory would be better off without political
parties? His rider that if there were to be parties it would be better if
they were developed on sectional lines was merely an open confession of
the “divide-and-rule” principle. The way Mr. Barnes is going on, there
will soon be only one party in New Guinea: a nationalist party demand-
ing independence.




Project Houses: The Dream Home Business
THE ENTRANCE to the office block
of Pettit and Sevitt, merchant builders,
is set in a miniature rain forest of
stylish greenery at St. Ives, Sydney. In-
side is Ron Sevitt his 32-year-old
partner, Brian Pettit, is in Melbourne
starting to build P. and S. houses there
and a staff of 30, two of whom,
young executives wearing pale jeans and
white shirts, had stopped for a chat to
the switchgirl when we walked in. They
sounded as though they were rehearsing
for a Pettit and Sevitt advertisement.
Executive 1: “A five-ton truck went
straight down a hill and into a Lowline
near Gordon station this- morning.”
Executive 2: “Full of sand the
truck, I mean.”
Executive 1: “John Laws was renting
it - the Lowline, not the truck.”
Executive 2: “He came on the air a
bit late because of it. Said he was de-
layed by a five-ton truck in the living-
room.”
Executive 1 (with pride): “The Low-
line stopped it, though!”
Mr. Sevitt was not surprised. “Very
solid houses, ours,” he said. “The Low-
line is our best seller. We’re on our fifth
or sixth version of it now.” Mr. Sevitt,
38, born in Ireland, projects an Ameri-
can executive style with his black-
rimmed spectacles, grey-streaked hair,
and his coffee percolating discreetly
and constantly behind a louvre-doored
cupboard near his desk. The American
style came out even more clearly when
we dashed out to look at a Lowline
(basic price $10,600) in Mr. Sevitt’s
Jaguar. He kept in touch with head-
quarters by a grey phone. “Car 1, com-
ing in. Over,” he would say. “Treat this
as a matter of urgency.”
Altogether there are about 50 project
builders in Australia who are now put-
ting up almost a third of privately
owned houses. They introduce assembly-
line methods, but at the same time they
increase the percentage of architect-
designed homes.
Statistics for the County of Cumber-
land (that is, the greater Sydney area)
show that in 1962 23 percent of houses
were project-built; by 1967 the figure
was 30 percent. Contract houses (usu-
ally architect- or owner-designed) went
from 19 percent in 1962 to only 21 per-
cent in 1967. In the same period owner-
built houses dropped from 13 percent
to 11 percent and speculatively built
houses remained at the same level, 30
percent. A final group, classified as
“private houses thought to be archi-
tect-designed,” dropped from 15 percent
to eight percent in the five years.
The Royal Australian Institute of
Architects acknowledges that the
higher-priced project houses have cut
into the architects’ traditional market,
but encourage project builders to put
up architect-designed houses. The
Institute is at present conducting a
competition for the best architect-
designed project house.
The feeling that somehow Australia
is on the move again is one of the big
impulses in the latest development of
the Australian dream-home business
The world’s greatest house-owning dem-
ocracy is ahead of many other coun-
tries in developing the project-house
idea. In an article in the London
“Observer” last year Australian project
homes were photographed and dis-
cussed. “What a pity,” the article fin-
ished, “that we can’t see a similar Brit-
ish relationship between some talented
architect and an adventurous builder!”
Pettit and Sevitt, although not the
biggest operation in the field, have been
able to dramatise their role most pub-
licly to the market’s prestige end. In
their purchases profile they see the
“young executive” as their ideal client.
With the limit of definition that marks
many successful selling plans, they aim
for about three percent of the market.
Their “young executive” earns a rela-
tively high income but doesn’t have
much capital; he wants to believe that
he has a knowledge of good modern
design, but he can’t afford to hire an
architect to discuss his theories of mod-
ern design with. This is a relief to most
architects, who prefer bigger and more
impersonal jobs to the traumas of build-
ing houses that provide definitions of
halting, confused personal lives and
tastes- . , , .
Pettit and Sevitt got into the busi-
ness seven years ago. They had com-
bined resources of just over £lOOO
when they put up their first Lowline.
It took them six weeks to build, watch-
ing costs as if they were their own
clients, and four weeks to sell. They
made a profit of £5OO out of it. With
£l5OO now in kitty they started all
over again, expanding their business as
their capital grew out of profits.
After three years of this they hired
Ken Woolley, a Wilkinson Prize
winner, and flew to the United States to
find out how to merchandise what
Woolley was about to design. It was
from this trip that they got the idea
of putting up an exhibition village.
They built six houses at St. Ives, for
a cost of $150,000, and the houses were
open for exhibition for 18 months. In
their second go-round with an exhibi-
tion of ten houses, still at St. Ives, they
spent $350,000. By this time they had
added two more architects to their
establishment, and by now have sold
nearly 1000 houses, ranging from $9OOO
to $26,000 (without land).
They are haunted by the thought of
the woman who buys a dress off the
rack and sees it on someone else the
first time she wears it. Like other
project builders, in their higher price
range they stress individual variabili-
Ron Sevitt. His firm aims for the “young executive,”
perhaps three percent of the market
What to do on a quiet Sunday. Visitors at the Hooker-Rex
project-home centre at Killarney Heights, Sydney
E. W. and E. G. Satchel!, father and son.
People say weird things, but they still buy”
ties of design. They also zone their
houses so that they are reasonably far
apart and the purchasers of them do
not suffer the indignity of seeing their
house in the next street.
To keep business moving a project
builder must spend part of his margin
on selling exhibition villages, sales-
men who can cut out the half dozen
serious buyers from the 2000 who might
visit his exhibition on a weekend, good
advertising. Pettit and Sevitt did well
out of their advertising. Condensed
sans serif dialogues between the part-
ners set the advertising business talking.
There was topicality. (At election time:
VOTE 1 PETTIT AND SEVITT
FOR BETTER HOMES.) And snob
appeal (98 PERCENT OF HOUSES
LOOK LIKE THIS . . . THE OTHER
2 PERCENT ARE BUILT BY PET-
TIT AND SEVITT.) Copywriter
Dennis Everingham, who handled the
ads, says: “Brian and Ron hit the roof
when they saw the advertisement. Too
avant-garde, they said.” Sevitt says:
“There’s no doubt that Dennis gave us
the Pettit and Sevitt image. Now I get
complaints and applications for jobs
written in P. and S. advertisement
style.”
Developments such as the Pettit and
Sevitt project housing not only provide
a new marketing technique in house-
building. They also give city dwellers
something pleasant to do on a sunny
afternoon. The Saturday newspapers
offer entrancing dreams in advertise-
ments inviting the inspection of exhi-
bition villages.
If you play it properly you can take
in five or six of them in a nice day’s
outing. Families take picnic lunches,
finishing off their canned beer or their
vacuum flask tea as their children run
in circles round the artistically land-
scaped gardens, with their easy-care
shrubs, clumps of pampas grass grow-
ing against white walls, and river-pebble
paths. The children complain when
they hurt their feet on the river pebbles
(cost, $lO per ton) or read the THIS
LAVATORY CANNOT BE USED
signs in front of exhibition lavatories
barricaded with wire. When lunch is
over, parents open cupboards, shake
partitions, and thump at walls, perhaps
hoping that the whole project will fall
about their ears.
When E.W. and E.G. Satchell, father
and son, opened three well-designed
houses this year they had 16,000 visi-
tors in three weekends. Perhaps it was
the names of the houses: John Mac-
arthur, James Ruse, and William Far-
rer. (Macarthur lived in a farmhouse,
Ruse in a mud hut, and Farrer in a
tin-roofed cottage.)
The day we went to the exhibition a
thousand people had been attracted by
the call of instant squattocracy. A
fatigued salesman stood handing out
brochures in the entrance of William
Farrer. (SATCHELL HOMES WITH
INDIVIDUAL LIVING. A STEP
BEYOND THE PROJECT HOME.)
Beside him was a well-dressed matron.
Her eyes flickered over the large living
area to the open-plan kitchen, breakfast-
room, family area, and laundry. There
was no door between Living and
Cookery the only impediment to her
gaze was the door to the bathroom
but she said to her husband: “What a
lovely house! Wouldn’t it look wonder-
ful if you really opened it up.” “They
say weirder things than that,” the
Satchell salesman told us. “But they
still buy.”
Satchells say they quote on the fin-
ished home with everything—drainage,
foundations, built-in cupboards in-
cluded. “Some project builders give
the trade a bad name,” said Mr. Sat-
chell, jun. “They give a basic quote
for a house on a flat piece of land and
the client nearly always fimds he’s up
for $2OOO extra, with foundations and
so on.”
Civic Constructions (“Homes of Dis-
tinction”) built their first houses in
1961 and pride themselves on “finish.”
“Our name is associated only with
quality homes,” said their managing
director, Mr. Cullen. “This project
stunt caught on all right, but some of
the people in the game are entrepren-
eurs, not builders.”
All good entrepreneurs want to sell
their acts and all good builders want
to sell their houses. Labels sell pro-
ducts, so every project house has a
name. There is some poetic licence with
these. Lynton Constructions have Poly-
nesian names like Halenui, Rangi, or
Tiki. The architect who designed these
good, solid family houses was once a
pilot and had happy memories of fly-
ing around the South Seas.
At the Lend Lease village, Kings-
dene, in Carlingford, Sydney, where
500 lots have been for sale, a central
signpost points to Casa Blanca, Golden
Gate, Arcadia, and, more prosaically,
toilets and refreshments. Lend Lease
have been project builders on a large
scale since 1960. The 12 houses shown
at the Kingsdene estate are medium-
priced family homes designed by Nino
Sydney for a price range of $7650 to
$14,450.
Lend Lease have often tried to sell
the American-style project-home de-
velopment house, plus land, plus
landscaped garden, in one package
to Australians, but without success.
Apple Tree Hill in Melbourne was
one example. Architect Robin Boyd de-
signed half a dozen attractive houses,
set them properly on their blocks, and
Lend Lease set out to sell 384 lots in
a planned neighborhood. The experi-


ment failed. Buyers wanted (a) their
own home on a Lend Lease block of
land; (b) a Lend Lease house in some
other suburb; or (c) the house and land
but would like to plant their own rock-
eries and cement their own driveways.
Lend Lease has pulled out of home-
building entirely in Victoria and is
busy selling off blocks of land in Apple
Tree farm.
“The idea certainly wasn’t as popu-
lar as we wanted it to be,” Ken Mc-
Grath, managing director of Lend
Lease Homes Division, said. “In
America, a home is a commodity; here
it is a castle. Australians are very much
individuals. We have now compro-
mised with the exhibition-village idea.
We build some houses, make land
available near the village with restric-
tive covenants to ensure that the type
of house built is to a certain standard.
The village at Carlingford is the fourth
to be built in the area in five years.
We sell off the houses after a year,
bring the designs up to date, and build
another village. The exhibition-village
idea is good because people can’t
visualise a house from floor plans.”
Australians like to see solid houses
instead of floor plans, and, apart from
Pettit and Sevitt’s three percent of the
population, we like to buy the most
solid and unadventurous house of all:
the übiquitous triple-fronted red brick
and tile bungalow. That is why Hooker-
Rex have been putting new versions
of brick-and-tile bungalows on their
vast exhibition villages in places like
Flagstaff Hill in Adelaide and Kil-
larney Heights, 15 miles from Sydney.
A quarter of a million people visited
Killarney Heights in ten weeks when
it was opened three years ago. The
immense tract of land was carved into
900 blocks with shoping centre, high
school, and oval. Indignant residents
said that the Hooker people had razed
every tree to the ground. Killarney
Heights was christened the “dust
bowl.”
“Nonsense,” says Mr. K. Dalton, gen-
eral manager of Hooker-Rex Homes
Division. “We plant 1000 trees a year
on our estates. Killarney Heights
was a gravel pit before we started;
no trees worth keeping.” Treeless or
not, there are only 30 blocks still left
for sale.
“We conducted a competition to find
out what sort of house the average
family really wanted,” Mr. Daltofi said.
“We built the winning house and it
was the hardest thing to sell we have
ever handled. Young people like look-
ing at what you might call avant-garde
houses, but they usually buy what will
resell, and that’s the triple-fronted,
solid brick and tile.”
The winning house was hardly avant-
Best-seller... Pettit and Sevitt have sold more of this house than any other of
their designs. It is the Lowline, now in its fifth version
garde, by the way; it was a sedate red
brick colonial, with cement pillars on
the front veranda instead of wrought-
iron.
Kuringai Council, which encompasses
the North Shore area, where most of the
Sydney project builders have built their
villages, has just banned exhibition
houses from the municipality, giving the
reason that they were commercial
dwellings in a wholly residential area.
“Land around St. Ives is just about
finished, anyway,” Mr. Sevitt said.
“Most of the project houses are going
up in surrounding municipalities.”
St. Ives now looks rather forlorn on
Sundays. Owners have taken down the
Open For Inspection signs and put up
For Sale ones. The houses are still
there to be looked over, but the crowds
have melted away, leaving only the
serious buyers.
Pettit and Sevitt are looking to the
future, and as Span Developments will
start investigating the market for town
houses.
Lend Lease is also looking to the
future. “There are only seven years,
perhaps less, of Green Belt land to
build on in Sydney,” said Mr. McGrath,
“and the position is much the same jn
the other cities. We believe in satellite
towns, so much so that we are going all
out to develop Sherwood Hills, in
Campbelltown, on the outskirts of
Sydney.”
Campbelltown‘promises to be three
times as big as present-day Canberra.
Lend Lease are developing another
planned suburb there with electrical
installations underground, reasonably
priced houses, tarred roads, and gut-
tered kerbs.
Very few of the project builders live
in their own products. Ron Sevitt lives
in a Woolley-designed house, but it is
a good deal more luxurious than the
ones in his village. Mr. Satchell says he
can’t afford to build one of his own
houses for himself. One Lend Lease
advertising manager does live in a
Lend Lease house, but “only by acci-
dent.” He. bought it before he worked
for the company. >
There are, of course, some criticisms
of project houses. One man wanted a
project design, but in full brick instead
of the scheduled brick-veneer and with
some alterations which the merchant
builders were not prepared to make.
He says he eventually built a house
rather similar in appearance, in full
brick and with the alterations he
wanted, for only $lBOO more than the
figure quoted by the merchant builder
for their project house.
Other people find the rigidity with
which the details are worked out some-
what trying. One woman, buying a
two-bathroom house, wanted all tiles
in both rooms white. “It’s one white
and one color,” the buildeh said. “It s
part of the deal.” There was some
argument and in desperation the woman
finally said: “All right, I’ll have a
color, but I want the color to be
white.” She got it.

SPECULATOR:
THE FIRST 2761 DAYS
Last week, while nickel boomed on the stockmarket, Speculator's
Diary reached a milestone; the original stake that Speculator set
out with 7 i years ago has now multiplied by ten times. The
Bulletin's Finance Editor, who was "Speculator" in the first
year of the column's life, looks back on its first 2761 days.
By MICHAEL BAUME
IF ONLY HE HAD KNOWN some-
thing about nickel, Speculator could
have saved himself a lot of trouble.
For the past 1\ years he has solidly
and earnestly played the stockmarket,
reporting each week on his activities
in The Bulletin, and has made about
1400 buying and selling transactions,
costing him about $6OOO in brokerage.
The result of all this work and worry
has been that he has increased his
original stake by ten times in those 1\
years (despite having paid out most
of his profits in dividends instead of
ploughing it all back into his fund).
This is an excellent record; few
other speculators would have done so
well especially if they are specula-
tors like our Speculator. For he does
not know anything about mining, where
most of thfc big profits are to be made,
and has always been a little nervous
of it, preferring to make his money
the hard way in the ordinary, dull
investment section of the market that
he understands.
But his way is certainly the hard
way; he could have achieved almost
the same result in all these years of
speculating if he had simply bought
some Western Mining shares last year.
That is what the nickel boom has meant
to the stockmarket.
So it is ironically appropriate that
Speculator should have passed this
milestone of a ten-times profit while
Australia is in the midst of one of its
greatest speculative mining booms
ever without actually holding any
nickel shares whatsoever, and having
missed out completely on the boom.
But failing to make money on Western
Mining and all the other nickel hope-
fuls is nothing unusual for him.
Speculator has a remarkable record;
he has (with one or two minor excep-
tions) missed out on every major
speculative boom in minerals or oil
since he began his column.
He has missed both the BHP booms
(in 1961 and 1966-67), he has kept
quite clear of the nickel boom with
Western Mining so far this year, and he
was innocent of all knowledge of the
part Renison was going to play in the
1964 tin boom. His victories with oil
stocks have been minimal (apart from
a modest success of $4OO on Woodside
in 1966), he completely failed to under-
stand or take any real profits from the
beach sands revival; uranium has meant
nothing to him; copper to him is some-
thing you boil clothes in, rather than
invest in; phosphate is, in his opinion,
for the birds.
Poor old Speculator is a mining
moron; he cannot tell his winze from
his drive. So, apart from one or two
special situations that have been
evident even to him, he has earned
almost all his profits from industrial
shares. Yet he has managed, in the
dullest section of the market, where all
the genuine investors buy their shares,
to make the sort of speculative profits
that most of the mining speculators
hunger after so unsuccessfully. All this
is not to deny that old Speculator has
been stocked up with BHP, or Western
Mining, or Renison at some time or
another. It’s just that he always had
them at the wrong time.
But he shows a much better touch
with non-mining shares. And the facts
of his success with them are impressive.
When the 1966-67 financial year ended
last week, Speculator’s total holdings
(and dividends paid out of his profits)
had risen to $36,000 since he began
operations with $3600 in November of
1959. (These profits are gross; Specu-
lator has never been obliged to present
a bill to the Taxation Commissioner.
Like most of his readers, he has taken
the view that he isn’t really a speculator
at all but an investor who makes de-
cisions and then changes them for good
reasons. When he gets caught, the tax
bill will be horrendous.)
Normally he gets through about 200
transactions a year, or about four a
week, which means that his stockbroker
loves him.
Speculator has not depended on
rising markets for his profits; one of
his long standing maxims has been that
it does not matter which way the
market is moving, just so long as it is
moving. Changes in prices are the
stuff that profit dreams are made on.
For example, when the market dropped
so sadly in 1961 (down 22 percent),
Speculator went happily on making
money; the only problem was that his
rate of profit-making eased a little
from 64 percent on capital in the boom
years of 1960 to a still-healthy 55 per-
cent.
But there can be no doubt that in a
rising market, Speculator can do much
better than in a dull one. His best
result ever—a 74 percent profit —came
in 1963, when the stockmarket jumped
by almost 20 percent to better even the
best rise that 1960 could offer. So, this
year as the market bounds up again
(8 percent so far in 1967), Speculator
should do a lot better than the modest
30 percent profit he came up with in
1966 (his worst result yet) when the
market was stagnant.
His part of the market has been fairly
dull ever since the 1960 boom burst;
apart from his occasional forays into
the mining business (where some of the
most dramatic developments in Aus-
tralia’s mineral history have taken
place) he has had to make his money
in a most unfriendly investment climate.
But there have been moments of
excitement even in his section of the
market. After the market slide of late
1960 and the 1961 recession (and the


big recovery in BHP prices as the
Americans discovered the company),
there was all the drama of the com-
pany crashes. In 1962 it was the year
of the disasters Reid Murray, Latec,
the Korman group of Chevron, Stan-
hill, and so on - that knocked the
confidence out of the market for quite
some time. And, of course, the Com-
mon Market lark helped keep things
pretty dull in 1962 before Britain had
the door closed in its face at the be-
ginning of 1963.
Things certainly looked up in 1963
when the market recovered generally,
and in addition in 1963 there came the
sugar boom (it took two years for that
one to flop). This was followed by the
tin boom in 1964 (when the Financial
Review’s investment competition was
won by a gentleman who put all his
money in one tin stock and left it there
to more than double while Speculator
ran around in circles earning 37 per-
cent on his cash).
Speculator even suffered the indignity
of actually losing money on the stock
in question, Renison, by selling too
soon. Had he held he would have made
$3200 on his outlay of $1440. This
would have almost doubled his profit
for the year. That was probably Specu-
lator’s most dramatic mistake. And it
was only because his Tableland Tin
shares came good (earning him a profit
of $1350) that he even managed to do
as well as earn a 37 percent profit for
1964.
Significantly enough, this Tableland
Tin profit was the best single gain in
his years of business, although the
Hanimex profit of $660 also in 1964
wasn’t a bad effort. But this generally
establishes another of Speculator’s little
maxims don’t try to be too greedy.
Speculator finds it more rewarding to
make lots of little profits than to try to
get a few big ones. And he always be-
lieves in buying a bit late and selling a
bit too soon. This shows his innate
caution and a refreshing willingness
to leave some profits for the next
buyer.
Speculator has plenty of other golden
rules, like always buy into a fight, or
generally take an interest in a stock
with a takeover offer, on the view that
if it is a good buy for one bidder it
generally is a good buy for another.
Getting back to his years of his-
tory, it was a dull old year in 1965,
but 1966 saw the beginnings of the
mining boom, which has brought such
life back into the market. Typically,
Speculator sold out his holding of West-
ern Mining just as it began its spec-
tacular rise late in 1966.
He does plead guilty to having pet
stocks; Hanimex certainly rated as
such a few years ago, and so did AOG,
when Speculator found himself in and
out of it five times in one year. But
he also has pet hates. Generally these
are because he gets infuriated by
failure and he has not had successes
all the way; far from it. He came a
bellyflopper on Ready Mixed Concrete
(and didn’t he complain about that!),
the MLC, and Mauri Bros. Despite
some very sour remarks he has made
when hit in that most delicate part of
a speculator’s anatomy the hip
pocket nerve he has avoided libel
actions so far.
There are some awful “dogs” among
the stocks that Speculator has run
through in his time, with plenty of them
subsequently going into receivership or
worse. All that matters to him is that
they made him money; they did not
have to be beautiful as well.
He started his diary in November,
1959, with a most unlikely threesome
of Electronic Industries B shares, F. J.
Palmer (they lost him a packet), and
Carapark (remember that one). And
then he added Brambles, Rosella, and
Morts Dock two weeks later. It’s some
sort of comment on old Speculator
that only two (Electronic and
Brambles) of these six stocks are still
with us in their original form: F. J.
Palmers have merged with Bucking-
hams, Carapark is now part of Motels
of Australia, Rosella is now a subsidiary
of Unilever, and Morts Dock is getting
toward the end of its life in the hands
of the receiver. And both the “live”
ones are at prices well below what they
were going for back in December 1959
Electronics were then $2.90 (they
are now 70 cents) and Brambles were
$2.90 (now they are $1.20).
In fact, the number of stocks Specu-
lator dealt in that are no longer with
us is some sort of indication of the
calibre of many of the companies he
finds most interesting: Marcus Clark,
Holyman Woods, A. J. Benjamin,
Mutual Store, et al. But he goes in for
the good ones, too. He had BHP in
the portfolio at $7.80 back in 1960, and
some CSR at $6.50 in 1964.
He is also a bit old fashioned in
the techniques he uses; he even pays
his broker, for instance. And one of
the greatest innovations in recent times
to help the speculator the options
market he has hardly ever used.
Like the stockbrokers themselves, he
scorns the options post, preferring to
play with his own money than pay
dearly for the privilege of only having
to put up a fraction of the cost of a
stock.
This is fine for rising situations. But
when he feels confident that a stock
is going to fall, he takes his courage in
his hands and “shorts” it: sells it with-
out actually owning it in the hope of
being able to buy it back in the market
in a week or so at a cheap price. He
managed quite a few successful short-
ing operations in the grim days of 1961
and 1962, but lately this has not been
a “shorter’s market.” True, he has done
some “put” options, like the very suc-
cessful one in 1966 on Amalgamated
Chemicals which earned $132. But it
is not like real speculating to protect
yourself that way.
Now his readers will be wondering
whether he has the courage to “short”
Western Mining. After all, he has found
them too expensive to buy; are they
just right to sell? This could be one
way of getting in on the nickel boom at
last.

THE BRITISH
PULL-OUT
“What-to-do-la?”
By DONALD HORNE
THERE IS NO particular point in just
whingeing because the British are go-
ing to pull their army out of Singa-
pore and Malaysia. If you look at it in
one way, it is remarkable that they
have stayed for so long, and remarkable
that, at least for the moment, they still
intend to have some connection with the
area even after they have handed over
the bases.
Australians speak from an indefen-
sible position if they criticise the British.
Proportionately, we are more prosper-
ous than Britain; we do not have the
same anxieties about maintaining a
world currency; and our immediate
interest in the South-East Asia area is
much clearer than theirs: yet'we devote
a smaller proportion of our resources
to armed commitment and, on a popu-
lation basis, our forces in Malaysia have
been less. If we criticise them they
have a perfect right to say: “Look
who’s talking!” Why should we expect
them to do proportionately more than
we do ourselves, when our own inter-
ests are more directly involved?
The father-son metaphor can be
overdone when we discuss our relations
with Britain, but in this instance it
seems illuminating to regard any whinge-
ing we go on with as an example of a
grown-up son’s lack of self-reliance. We
can hardly expect father to go on doing
more for our neighborhood than we do
ourselves, when we live there and he
doesn’t. Merely to express chagrin that
a familiar presence will grow much
less is in itself to confess to a kind of
childishness. Although it can provide
emotional satisfaction, there is never
any practical point in merely lamenting
change if one cannot stop it. What
matters to us now is the question of
what should be done or, as they
would put it in Singapore, with a shrug
and a gesture of the hands, “What-to-
do-la?”
First, what are the British up to?
The British want to get their land
forces out of Singapore and Malaysia
and hand over their bases to the Gov-
ernments of those two nations. They
have mentioned 1975 as a likely de-
parture date, but they may go sooner
than this 1972 is already being can-
vassed. The British say that they will
keep some sea and air presence in the
area. To effect this, they would lease
their bases or part of them back
from Singapore and Malaysia, as they
now do in Malta. They would also
want to use Australian bases, which
would mean that we would have to en-
large what we have at Darwin and
make up our minds about building a
base at Cockburn Sound. They also say
that they would keep a mobile land
force in Britain, or somewhere, which
could always be flown out.
The British suggestion that they in-
tend to keep some sea and air forces
in the area is, as they would say in
Washington, credible. The British Navy
has to be kept somewhere and some
of it can be kept reasonably cheaply
in our part of the world, thereby giv-
ing the British still some faint glow
of Great Power status; and air forces
can be shuttled around quickly from
one place to the other. That both
naval and air forces are almost irrele-
vant to the main security problems of
the area is another matter, but at least
even this commitment of small and
largely irrelevant forces is a commit-
ment; it represents a better possibility
of dragging the British back into the
area if we need them than if they
kept nothing at all in our area.
One might regard their “mobile land
force” with more scepticism. Other
exigencies are likely to dissipate it, and
in any case there would be no British
Army units with the special training that
warfare in South-East Asia demands.
It seems likely that if the British were
to send troops back, there would have
to be a long creative pause while they
put them together and trained them.
We should not be optimistic about even
this happening. South-East Asia is now
a dead spot in the European imagina-
tion, except as a stick to belt the Ameri-
cans with, and if the British become
more “European” their decline of in-
terest will accelerate.
What happens to Singapore when the
British pull out? If the process were too
quick and without compensation, there
would be a collapse of Singapore’s
economy, vitally dependent on the base
and on Vietnam war procurements.
This could mean a collapse of Lee
Kuan-yew’s tough, progressive Govern-
ment and a turning, in desperation to
a Peking-oriented chauvinism that' at
the very worst might provoke savage
reaction from the Malays of Indonesia
and Malaysia, and at the next worst
might produce a kind of Cuba in South-
East Asia.
What-to-do-la? The Singapore Gov-
ernment and community are adaptable
and resourceful, but they must be given
time to display their resourcefulness.
There is a good case for arguing that
the British, having created Singapore,
and its problems, should not merely
dump it, nor merely phase out gradu-
ally, but make a special case of its
economy and give it special, if diminish-
ing, economic consideration. The Aus-
tralian Government should urge special
consideration to Singapore, and it
should set the British an example by
giving Singapore special assistance
not necessarily in charity, but by buy-
ing, for example, more of the things
that Singaporeans can make.
What happens to Malaysia? As things
stand for the moment, nothing much.
Perhaps some pangs of emotional in-
security, perhaps some quickening of
Malay nationalism, perhaps, pie-
emptively, a stronger anti-Americanism,
expressing an understandable pride that
just because the British are pulling out,
does not mean that the Americans have
to be called in. If these are the only
immediate problems, as things stand
now, the Malaysians will expect an
increased Australian role, of a brotherly
rather than a paternalistic kind more
assistance in military and economic
training, and probably some increase in
armed forces. When Tun Razak,
Malaysia’s Deputy Prime Minister,
came to Australia this year some Aus-
tralian officials expected him to ask for
some of this, thus helping them to down
the Treasury. Razak, on the other hand,
did not want to ask, but he would have
accepted more if it had been offered.
If we merely wait to be asked, we may
SUHARTO AND MALIK. ..


not another adventure
lose the goodwill that we have now
built up in Malaysia.
If things don’t go as happily as
this, how would they go wrong? An-
other outbreak of the Indonesia-Malay-
sia confrontation? Not likely. The
generals surrounding President Suharto
don’t really want to push him into
another military-propaganda adventure
because this would wreck Indonesia’s
negotiations with its international
debtors’ club, and then Indonesia might
cease to work as a nation. Although it
is true that Foreign Minister Malik’s
wish for a full normalisation of rela-
tions with Malaysia has been frustrated
by the generals, this does not mean
that they want another open clash, but
that they hope that troubles in Sabah
and Sarawak might in themselves
achieve for them what confrontation
failed to do.
An internal communist threat in
Malaysia? Possible but, for the
moment, not likely. Anyway, in this
case, the Malaysians might now very
well look to Indonesia as well as to
us. The possible threat that must absorb
our interest in Malaysia is the one that
raises questions of world power, and
not merely of regional dispute: that,
after all the jokes made about it, the
domino theory might still prove to be
true. If, for some reason or other, the
Viet Cong won in South Vietnam and
the Thais, anxious for survival, bent
with the wind, as they did both in the
face of European and of Japanese
colonialism, Malaysia might be the next
country on the agenda.
What-to-do-la then? If the British
were still involved in Malaysia, it would
be mainly on their initiative that action
would be taken. In the future it is more
likely that the British Government
for economic and political reasons -—■
would try to avoid involvement. How-
ever, this need not make the Malay-
sians despair. Nor need it make us fear
that immediate repetition of the Jap-
anese onslaught with the Chinese play-
ing the Japanese role which has been the
main hypothesis of our Government’s
thinking.
The most significant thing that has
happened in South-East Asia this dec-
ade, so far as Australia is concerned,
is not the worsening of the Vietnam
War, but the change of regime in
Indonesia. As things now stand in the
Malay Archipelago, with the four na-
tions that constitute it now determin-
edly anti-Peking, a regional effort alone
—■ with help from Australia and New
Zealand would go a long way to-
ward handling such an emergency and
there would still be a chance of assist-
ance from America and Britain. Great
and powerful friends are handy to have.
But the nations of the Malay Archi-
pelago and the South-west Pacific must
now begin to produce some common
policy for handling their own affairs.
The Commonwealth Strategic Force?
This is an idea that, probably, we now
must bury. Whether this concept ever
really meant anything more than an
arrangement to protect Malaysia’s
security is questionable, but it now
seems ended, anyway. The most sensible
assumption to make is that the British,
while wishing to look as if they are
still interested in the area, want to dis-
entangle themselves from it. We should
try to delay their departure, but we
should proceed with our planning on
the assumption that we can never rely
on them any more never again, in
our whole future history. If we work
on this assumption, anything they give
us will come as a pleasant surprise.
What does this mean for Australia?
In the first place, and perhaps above
all, we should work out a policy for
our armed forces that takes into account
their distinctive and peculiarly Aus-
tralian problems. Number One: For
uses we cannot now necessarily even
imagine, we must continue the military
tradition. Therefore we continue to need
armed forces. Number Two: While
maintaining some bits of a navy and
air force so that the Navy and Air
Force can continue to exist in case we
really need them some day, we should
concentrate in particular on the Army
so that it can play an expeditionary
and/or training role where needed,
since this is the obvious, immediate de-
mand to be made on our armed forces.
Number Three: We should increase the
size of our immediately deployable
Army by extending conscription and/or
by using our brains more in deciding
how we allocate spending on the armed
forces. Number Four: We should cut
out all the deadwood of defence com-
mittees set up by previous Govern-
ments, cut out all the deadwood of
ciyil service direction, and cut out all
the deadwood of overlapping overheads,
perhaps integrating our armed forces on
the Canadian pattern, so that -we get
more for the money. Number Five: If
we should then still have to spend a
bit more on the armed services, it
should be with an assurance that the
extra money produces fighting men. We
don’t want spending just for spending’s
sake, so that we can produce a higher
proportion of GNP figures to show to
the Americans.
In diplomacy, in world terms, we
should be concerned, along with our
neighbors, in trying to interest other
powers in the security of South-East
Asia, Indians and Japanese as well as
Europeans. We should remember that
South-East Asia does not seem as im-
portant to others as it does to us, except
for Vietnam, which many nations, in
their indifference, regard simply as a
gauche American blunder which can be
wished away, and that the idea, com-
mon enough in Australia, of China
coolly plotting to seize all South-East
Asia by guerilla warfare seems, in many
other nations, to be remotely absurd, in
Japan as much as in Europe. We
have to learn how to talk about the area
in a way that people will believe; this
will mean more subtlety in analysis and
more expression of decent aspiration.
In regional terms we must be ready
for the unexpected. We must beware,
for example, of automatically continu-
ing a special relationship only with
Singapore and Malaysia. We might
sometimes have to remain somewhat de-
tached from particular tensions within
the area. It is with the area as a whole
that we desire special relationships. If
some kind of group organisation is
formed between the States to our north,
this will assist us. However, the tests of
the future are not likely to be overcome
by diplomacy alone, with or without
diplomacy’s extension into military
forces. Our honesty of purpose and our
sense of nationhood would both seem to
demand changes in traditional trade
and immigration policies if we are
really to belong to the part of the world
where we see ourselves on the map.

formance troubles in the F-11l aircraft
demand a frank and searching investi-
gation into the wisdom of Australia’s
continuing with the current order or
turning to another alternative before it
is too late.
Close study of actual F-11l costs
given by the U.S. Defence Department
and the U.K. Government points to the
fact that a realistic estimate of the
total cost of the RAAF order for 24
aircraft will be in the order of SA3OO
million a figure far in excess of the
unrealistic figures hesitatingly admitted
by our Minister for Air to date.
The effectiveness of our order for
24 aircraft as a Canberra replacement
must be considered. Just how effectively
can 24 aircraft equip a Bomber Wing
of three squadrons and one Operational
Conversion Unit? Initial hopes and
rumors of an increase in the order to
an effective size have doubtless been
dashed by the ever-rising cost factor.
It would seem that the RAAF is now
destined to end up with a Bomber
Wing consisting of two “mini-squad-
rons,” each of eight F-llls with eight
aircraft left for back-ups, training, and
reconnaissance duties; hardly a flexible
force under any conditions.
It is interesting to note, by way of
comparison, that No. 75 (F) Squadron,
equipped with the somewhat similarly
modern Mirage 111, recently went to
Malaysia with 21 aircraft, presumably
the number needed to maintain an
operational strength of around 12 air-
craft. Are our two future F-11l squad-
rons to be equipped with the dubious
total of around five or six serviceable
aircraft at any one time?
Thus it would seem that if we are
to maintain an effective strike force our
F-11l wing should be equipped with
an absolute minimum of 40 and prefer-
ably 50 aircraft, a number well be-
yond the nation’s purse.
Before turning to an alternative strike
force let us consider some of the very
real and potentially expensive
unknowns of the Australian F-111C
variant.
What provision exists for meeting the
cost of any major modifications to the
aircraft which may become necessary
after delivery? Will such costs be borne
by the manufacturer or by the Austra-
lian Government?
Bear in mind that on present sched-
ule, the RAAF F-lllCs will have been
delivered before the USAF F-11l has
been proven in Vietnam (probably in
late 1968 or in 1969). Any deficiencies
shown up in combat will be in our
aircraft.
Will the RAAF aircraft be equipped
with the more powerful P&W TF-30-
P-12 engine which is being developed
in an endeavor to bring the F-11l per-
formance up to U.S. specification re-
quirements? This engine is scheduled
for air testing in developmental F-Ills
in 1968, and presumably will not be
fitted to production aircraft until some
lstcr d.2it6
The USAF FB-111 (identical air-
frame to the F-111C), later model F-
lllAs and U.K. F-lllKs will be fitted
with the more modern Mark II Avionic
system as against the Mark I system of
the RAAF variant. In what way will
this make the RAAF machine inferior
to the other models?
Should the new engine not com-
pletely cure the performance short-
comings, an extension of wingtips, fit-
ting of larger fuel tanks (and presum-
ably beefing up of some airframe and
undercarriage components to carry the
extra weight) have been considered.
Will the RAAF machines have been
delivered before the need for such
modifications has been finally deter-
mined?
Considering these unknowns, it could
Henry J. Kuss, U.S. armaments salesman
...he said on a visit to Australia in
May the F-111 price would rise
well be prudent to wait until the F-11l
has been finally tested and proven be-
fore accepting delivery, thus obtaining
the best variant available as a result
of testing, and, if possible, as a result
of some Vietnam proving.
Can we afford to wait, and can we
afford the cost of the ultimate F-11l
when it is built?
If we now turn to an alternative, we
must assume that the Government is
prepared (and at present committed)
to spend some SA3OO million on a strike
force. Using this price as our limit,
what else is available that will do the
job as well or better? The answer
would seem, very decisively, to be the
tried and battle-proven McDonnell F-4
Phantom.
Some 2000 have been built, produc-
tion continues at well over one per
day, and the aircraft is widely ack-
nowledged as the most effective
and as a fighter/bomber the safest
aircraft in use today in Vietnam.
There is no cost escalation problem,
the manufacturers claiming that long
production runs, and efficient methods
together with a lack of problems in the
aircraft, have actually led to a reduction
in costs to the extent that bare Phan-
toms are now being delivered to the
U.S. Defence Department for
$U.5.700,000 each. Costs of equipped
aircraft quoted to West Germany and
New Zealand have been reported as
being in the vicinity of SA2 million
each. Compare this figure with the
latest and by no means final estimate
of $A6.9 million for the USAF version
of the F-11l and SA2 million for the
USN F-1118 version.
The Phantom variant most suited to
our requirements would probably be
the Rolls-Royce Spey engined F-4M
developed for the RAF, and having
greater range and performance than the
U.S. model. Allowing for spares, sup-
port equipment, and any minor local
modifications, a price of SA3 million
per aircraft would appear reasonable.
Thus we now have two alternatives
available for the one price. On one
hand, 24 F-lllCs, on the other, 100
F-4 Phantoms. In deciding which will
give us the better value we must bear
in mind that one F-11l cannot.be com-
pared with one Phantom. We must
compare one F-11l with four Phantoms.

from the trading center of North America
each type. Each F- 111 is required by
U.S. specifications to be able to fly 30
hours per month a figure yet to be
reached under combat conditions. In-
dividual Phantoms have actually logged
jnore than 100 hours, under combat
conditions in Vietnam, per month.
Each F- 111 is required to be opera-
tionally available for 75 percent of the
time. This figure also is yet to be proven
in combat. Phantoms, although reput-
edly requiring more maintenance, have
achieved this figure.
The F-11l is designed to operate
from unprepared 3000 ft. strips, common
jn Australia and South-East Asia. The
standard Phantom requires longer
sealed runways, much less common.
If, however, the U.S.-developed FOB
system, comprising portable catapults
and “Collapsible” runways made up
from aluminium planks with arrester
gear, was to be adopted, the position
reverses in favor of the Phantom. This
system is in use where sealed runways
do not exist in Vietnam.
The performance characteristics,
other than range, of the two types are
broadly similar. Maximum speeds
quoted are: F-11l at sea level, Mach
1.2, at altitude, Mach 2.5; Phantom at
sea level, Mach 1.15, at altitude, Mach
2.25.
From this it could be assumed that
the loss rate of either type under the
combat conditions to be experienced
in this area would be similar. Vietnam
experience has shown that supersonic
types such as the Phantom do not fare
any better than older, slower types
against SAMS and accurate groundfire.
Therefore, the F-11l would fare no
better than the Phantom. Indeed, if
air-to-air combat were encountered, the
Phantom in all probability would fare
considerably better than the F-111.
Thus, if a force of 24 F-llls and
100 Phantoms began action on the
same day, it would be likely that
when the 24th F-11l had been lost
and the F-11l capacity therefore re-
duced to zero some 70 Phantoms
of very lethal capacity, would remain.
Further, as a bonus, the Phantom
would be able to serve as a “fill-in”
fighter, in which role it is claimed by
many to have a performance in excess
of either the Mirage 111 or the MIG-
-21. This cannot be said for the F-111.
In fact, the U.S. Defence Department
has allocated funds for development of
the rival Lockheed F-12 fighter at the
expense of the F-111, which it appar-
ently considers inferior.
Over all, it could be said that, given
sufficient time and money, the F-11l
will be developed into the finest mili-
tary aircraft yet designed. However,
ean Australia afford to wait long
enough and to pay for the ultimate
aircraft when it is developed? The
alternative force of 100 Phantoms
■would appear to be far better.
Sudden appearance of some serious
fatigue problem could strip the RAAF
°f its Canberras or Sabres at any time,
and this should serve as impetus to get
°n with the job quickly.

Levelling off in the snow
By APRIL HERSEY
THINGS ARE GETTING altogether
too equal in the snow country. Not only
are there proletarian bushwalkers who
appear to own the summit of Mt.
Kosciusko, but the slopes are covered
with huttes and lodges and transplanted
clubs.
These days the only thing needed to
produce a lodge in the snow country,
apart from 30 people prepared to
become a legally constituted club, is
money. As anyone who can own a
poker-machine can make money, it is a
matter of time, once the squash courts
and swimming-pool have been built,
before every club in Sydney decides that
a lodge in the snow is a necessity.
The RSL is now at Cabramurra with
its youth hostel, meant to house 24
people, although 42 went up once. It
has all amenities and they try to keep
it for young people, boys and girls
together, though “strictly supervised,”
according to RSL authorities. It is very
reasonable for the under-twenties; in
fact, only $1.25 a day.
Two hundred skiers from Sydney
University’s Sports Union go each year
to their ski lodge at Thredbo, and there
is a Rugby Union lodge with 55 mem-
bers.
Signposts show a combination of
Aboriginal and Austrian names; inside
the lodge, the decor is usually in re-
verse. The Lodge, named after Namat-
jira, will be filled with beer-barrels and
hand-embroidered curtains, and the
one that sounds like a suburb of Ber-
lin will be owned by a public service
organisation.
It is very different from the old days
of skiing when the Chalet was con-
sidered rugged, the Hotel Kosciusko
required people to dress for dinner, and
the lunatic fringe stayed over at Kiandra
in the converted jail. In those days the
whole thing was for the wealthy, thirsty,
well dressed, and slightly mad, apart
from the odd poverty-stricken Austrian
student being rescued by teams of Mac-
quarie Street specialists (a group who
have always been involved in this
suicidal sport).
I suspect that some of these lodges
have somewhat phantom committees,
since it doesn’t look possible to accom-
modate too many people in them.
The business of private booking of
club lodges is one of the main conten-
tions which rend the gentle hills about
Kosciusko. According to the commercial
lodges, this is a terribly unfair situation,
because in most places, except Thredbo,
private or club lodges pay less for their
leases. The club lodges, on the other
hand, could not survive without taking
private bookings. This is all passed
over by the authorities. In any case it
is very hard to tell a stranger from a
friend of a friend.
At Thredbo, local legend says private
Signpost at Perisher... all the tricks of the snow country aren’t on the slopes
lodges built “Before” were allowed to
stay. What “Before” means is not made
clear, but it probably means before
legislation. At Thredbo, Lend Lease is
referred to as the Company and Mr.
Dusseldorf, the head of the Company,
as Dussie or the Dutchman, depending
on how you feel about television.
Most of the residents are keen about
the Company’s chairlift, impressed by
its sewerage scheme, and split on the
question of television. Antennas are not
allowed to rise above the village. This
firm line is possible because the Com-
pany has acquired a 92-year lease and
has in turn sub-leased for a period of
42 years. At the end of 42 years with-
out television in this area, Australia may
have its first civil war.
However, this is a long way off and
the village has been filled with an un-
usual assortment of people, from Mr.
Dusseldorf, who has a regal lodge canti-
levered off the mountain and overseeing
all activity, to great crowds of perman-
ent builders’ laborers, many of whom on
closer examination turn out to be art
directors from advertising agencies.
There is a church at Perisher, a mar-
vellous building, perched high on the
hill. It is probably the only thing in
Perisher, again if the locals are to be
believed, which isn’t under franchise to
K. G. Murray. Murray pioneered this
area and holds a 45-year lease from the
Kosciusko Park Trust. A veteran skier
and a man of some foresight, he has
three hotels here the Sundeck, the
Man from Snowy River, and the Valley
Inn.
He also holds franchises for every-
thing from hairdressing to circus acts
for a period of ten years, seven of
which have now gone. Commercial
lodges expect he will get another fran-
chise over everything after this, and
another one after that, but this is prob-
ably just being pessimistic; eventually
Murray, too, will run out of leasehold.
There is a sense of inevitability that
In the End the Trust will get Every-
thing. However, brave souls like the
Fiersingers at Maritz Lodge, Perisher,
are building with great elegance and
including indoor heated swimming-pools
and sauna baths. They would like a
nightclub or a coffee-shop, but this is
already enfranchised, although, like
hairdressing, not supplied.
No one could call this a happy land.
It may be booked out with skiers in
the main season, but the people who
live there all the year round seem to
have many complaints. It is not much
use voicing them—a letter to the Kos-
ciusko Park Trust in one case elicited
a reply from the man who was being
complained about.
The N.S.W. Minister for Lands, Mr.
Tom Lewis, who is responsible for the
whole park, likes to ski and keeps assur-
ing the lodge-owners and, indirectly,
the public that “everything will be all
right.”
There is more snow (when it arrives)
than in Switzerland, and at the present
rate there will soon be more beds than
in Bankstown. The next thing may be a
full-scale shopping centre, built by
escaped art directors, financed by Lend
Lease, under franchise to Ken Murray,
on Ansett’s parking lot.


OVERSEAS
Middle East: the inner
conflicts of the Russians
ALL AID short of war remains the un-
written and awkward rule of Russian
diplomatic strategy. Now that the risk
of world war has subsided, the Russians
are busy trying to recover their posi-
tion in the Middle East and restore
their image throughout the world. They
set about the task with extraordinary
zeal Premier Aleksei Kosygin’s thun-
dering descent on the UN was quickly
followed by President Podgorny’s arrival
in Cairo at the head of a military mis-
sion because the Arabs’ defeat meant
a loss of face for the Soviet compar-
able to Mr. Khrushchev’s setback after
his Cuba adventure in 1962.
Their immediate purpose is to deprive
Israel of all the territorial gains it has
won in the field. Russia has managed
to mobilise for this diplomatic battle
all the Communist States in Europe
even Yugoslavia—with only the Ruma-
nians (and, of course, the Albanians)
refusing to fall into line. Russia has
promised to step up its economic and
military aid to Arab countries. The
speed with which it rebuilds Egypt’s
air force will show whether Russian in-
tentions are serious or merely verbal.
It is now possible to confirm and
supplement tentative assessments of
Russia’s behaviour in this crisis. The
Egyptians had full Russian backing
when they moved their troops to the
Israeli frontier, to counter an expected
Israeli strike against Syria. But the
decision to blockade the Straits of Tiran
was taken on President Nasser’s own
initiative. The Egyptian leader can also
be believed when he claims that the
Russians urged him not to attack Israel,
presumably on the assumption that the
United States would also urge restraint
and as successfully in Tel Aviv.
When this calculation collapsed and the
Israeli forces struck, the Russian leaders
took their vital decision on June 6 to
join in calling for an unconditional
cease-fire on their own though not,
it seems, without inner conflict. The
Arab allies were not consulted. This
explains why Russian and Arab moves
looked unco-ordinated in the hours that
followed. It also explains Arab resent-
ment against Russia’s betrayal, a resent-
ment that Egyptian and Syrian news-
papers are now trying to combat in the
name of the anti-imperialist struggle.
When they surveyed the Middle East
after the battle, the Russian leaders
must have concluded that, although
their carefully prepared positions had
been destroyed, the main props of their
policy remained unchanged. President
Nasser, who might have been swept
away by his disastrous defeat, was up-
held in office by a wave of popular
feeling. The Israeli offensive did not
bring the Syrian Government down.
Algeria, remote from the war and un-
scathed, now looms larger on the Arab
horizon. The Russians, however, seem
in no hurry to change horses. Algeria’s
Colonel Boumedienne travelled to
Moscow on June 12, with Egyptian
and Syrian blessing, as the spokesman
for the most intransigent Arab States.
He had talks with the top Russian
leaders, including Marshal Grechko, the
Defence Minister. It is not surprising
that these talks should have been
shrouded in secrecy, since they were
certainly concerned not only with re-
criminations but also with the extent
of future Russian military aid.
This was confirmed by President
Boumedienne’s rousing declaration to
a public meeting in Algiers last week
on his return from Moscow that 95
million Arabs would reassemble their
forces and use all their potentialities to
push Israel into the Mediterranean.
Though starting from a loser’s posi-
tion, the Russians are not without use-
ful weapons for a propaganda battle.
Kosygin ... face-saving at UN
This is why they chose to send their
biggest guns to the General Assembly.
Yet propaganda is not all. The real
bargaining will depend on all sorts of
other imponderables, such as the brittle
unity of the Arab States in imposing an
oil embargo and the degree of flexi-
bility shown by the Israeli Government
especially in view of the further com-
plications of Britain’s advice to the
Israelis not to try to hang on to
Jerusalem. In this line Harold Wilson
was really thinking not so much of the
plight of Jerusalem’s sullen Arab popu-
lace but of the need to show de Gaulle
just how European-thinking Britain is.
After the Cuba fiasco Mr. Khrush-
chev seems to have concluded that
Russia ought to avoid a direct confron-
tation with the United States and
should therefore minimise its involve-
ment in “wars of national liberation.”
His successors, even before this crisis,
have also tried to avoid a direct con-
flict. But they have been unwilling, or
unable, to extricate themselves from the
Vietnam war. They may now draw con-
flicting lessons from the Middle East
war. One faction may argue that con-
flicts by proxy are dangerous (or
humiliating), and that a deal should
be struck with the United States, par-
ticularly on nuclear non-proliferation.
The other faction may reply that when
the Americans see an ally threatened
with collapse, as in South Vietnam,
they do not hesitate to prop him up by
direct intervention. Indeed, brinkman-
ship is so absurd when nobody believes
in your readiness to go over the brink
that Russian policy can be attacked
from both sides.
It still seems quite clear that, despite
the Arab-Israel confrontation, the two
factions still co-exist in the Kremlin. As
long as the collective but divided
leadership continues to govern in Mos-
cow, its natural tendency will be to go
on wavering on the present line: the
policy of all aid short of war.

State. When Mao Tse-tung looks out
o ver his domain he is master of all he
surveys; but even on a clear day he
cannot see much farther than the city
gates. Beyond them the continental ex-
panse of China is descending into
anarchy.
The Maoists’ own claims about the
present extent of their control are
modest enough; only four provinces and
two cities have fully accredited “revo-
lutionary committees” in command. Yet
in recent weeks two of these “safe” pro-
vinces, Heilungkiang and Shaintung, and
both of the cities, Shanghai and Peking,
have erupted into civil warfare.
When workers are on the barricades,
they are not in the factories. The
current wave of unrest is clearly damag-
ing China’s economy,
Peking talks softly about stopping
the violence, but no longer carries a
big stick to enforce its will. The central
committee has issued a series of direc-
tives forbidding the theft and destruc-
tion of public and private property and
illegal searches and arrests. These
orders are heard on local radios through-
out the country. But there is nobody
at the other end to carry them out.
The lines of authority between the
capital and the provinces were shat-
tered last year when Mao destroyed
the Chinese Communist Party. And
the “revolutionary rebels” are too busy
fighting among themselves—and too
inexperienced—to take up the serious
job of administering their territories.
Six months ago Mao must have
thought he could turn things off when-
ever he wanted to because he held the
ultimate weapon in reserve: the Army.
Then the disruption of the late winter
and early spring forced him to use it.
And now it is clear that even the
People’s Liberation Army cannot
impose a Maoist peace. First of all the
Army was given an impossible job
to sort out the “genuine leftists” from
among the hundreds of rival self-styled
Maoist groups. Second, many local
commanders remained loyal to their old
comrades in the local party committees;
as often as not, the Army has turned
out to fight on the anti-Maoist side.
But, most important of all, the Army’s
command structure seems to have been
castrated in much the same way as
the Party’s. Some 47 generals and five
vice-admirals have lost their jobs since
the Chief-of-Staff, Lo Jui-ching, was
purged ovef a year ago. Recently
Peking tried to inject revolutionary
blood into the Army by making political
commissars out of the chairmen of the
six revolutionary committees. But even
m the Maoist centres where these com-
mittees hold sway, the Army has not
proved entirely reliable. It may be too
late for Lin Piao to issue a command
m Peking and expect to have his Army
fall in line.
So Mao Tse-tung may have thrown
his last ace. Now he faces the prospect
of watching China resolve itself into
fiefdoms while he is helpless to stop
rt. The Peking Press is saying that it
omy take three or four cultural revolu-
tions to whip the country properly into

make a man gulp. A miracle is not to
be ruled out; the Chinese Communists
have made them before. But it will

Malaysia
Blood debt settled
THE DIPLOMATS’ job is done the
Malaysian Government has announced
acceptance of a gift of two cargo ships
in settlement of Japan’s wartime “blood
debt.” Now experts from the two coun-
tries are to get down to work to make
Malaysia’s first ocean-going shipping
line a reality as soon as possible.
The harmonious discharge of Malay-
sia’s long-pending claims for compensa-
tion for World War II atrocities com-
mitted by the Japanese’against Malayan
Chinese is of major importance to both
countries: for Japan a reprieve from a
threatened embargo on all its trade
with Malaysia, and for the Kuala Lum-
pur Government an enormous saving
once it can ship tin, iron ore, and rub-
ber overseas in its own vessels.
Malaysia is paying about SAI3S mil-
lion in freight charges at present for
exports worth SA2IOO million. This is
a high price for a developing country
to meet out of its export earnings. Al-

Prime Minister Sato ... the last hurdle
ances was announced in Tokyo after a
second meeting between the Prime
Minister, Mr. Sato, and Malaysia’s
Tunku Abdul Rahman, the formal
signing will come later in Kuala Lum-
pur, where the public formalities of
brotherhood will do the most good.
Japan will have to pay SA7J million
for the two 10,000-ton freighters, but
even at this price they could be cheap
because last December the Associated
Chinese Chamber of Commerce in
Kuala Lumpur threatened that unless
the “blood debt” was settled within six
months, all Japanese goods would be
boycotted in Malaysia.
Although Japan bowed to the de-
mands, legally it did not have to pay.
From a legal standpoint, the compen-
sation issues were settled when Britain
relinquished all property claims against
Japan at the San Francisco Peace
Treaty. But Japan was finally happy
to accept moral responsibility for the
sake of future economic accord.

Pakistan
Shocking slavery
WAS THERE collusion in high places?
That is the awkward question now fac-
ing the authorities following the dis-
covery of a systematic network of slave
labor camps in West Pakistan, and
conditions so appalling they seem incon-
gruous in the twentieth century.
A drive by West Pakistani police
against the slave camps in outlying
desert areas has freed hundreds of
people men and boys who were
forced to work 16 to 20 hours a day
without pay, were whipped, chained,
and branded with hot irons. Some of
them had been slaves for 11 years.
Irrigation Department contractors
lured teenaged boys to these camps with
promises of well-paid jobs. They were
forced to dig canals on the gigantic
SA4SO million Indus Basin Replace-
ment Project, which is aided by the
World Bank. The slaves were kept under
guard and those who tried to escape
were beaten, often to death.
Describing the prisoners’ daily lives,
one said they toiled most days for 20
hours from midnight until 8 o’clock
next evening under whip-wielding
contractors. Then they were led inside
a circle of tents, chained, and fed on
bread and onion or molasses.
Nearly 100 arrests have been made
over running of the slave camps, and
there is country-wide clamor for the
death penalty for child kidnappers.,
Though President Ayub Khan has
ordered a court of inquiry into the
sordid affair, the immediate question
is: how did the Government remain
in ignorance so long? All the camps
were organised for public projects and
the work of contractors was constantly
supervised. Bills for payment were
passed only after the amount of work
done had been checked often weekly
on the spot by Government officials.
Surprise checks were also made periodi-
cally, yet the shocking camps were un-
disturbed for 11 years.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Spreading ourselves on drama
By PATRICIA ROLFE
WHAT WE NEED, they say, is a pro-
fessional drama company. This seems
to follow much the same principle as
once you have two cars in the family
you have to buy a boat. We now have
ballet and opera, so let’s spread our-
selves on drama.
The report is that at the end of this
year the Union Repertory Company,
Melbourne, will become a professional
repertory company. It is, of course, pro-
fessional, but its actors are now engaged
for each production; on a repertory-
system they will have contracts for at
least a year. The Union may also have
the advantage of Victorian liquor laws
(that we should live to see this day)
and have Australia’s first theatrical bar.
But no matter which city goes pro-
fessional first, several factors have
made things much more promising in
Sydney than they were. The first is that
the reorganisation of the interior of
the Opera House has provided a
theatre, seating about 750, suitable for
drama; something must be found to
make adequate use of this.
Another factor is the decision of the
State Government to divert more funds
from Opera House lotteries for cultural
activities. There is no substitute for
money. The committee disbursing
N.S.W. funds is under the chairmanship
of the übiquitous Dr. Coombs, also the
chairman of the Elizabethan. However,
it is clear from the peremptory way in
which the N.S.W. Government dealt
with the Opera House Committee, after
its inadequacies were clear, that if the
Cultural Grants Committee doesn’t go
about things in a way the Government
thinks sensible or fit, the Government
will find someone else for the job.
Allowing for the fact that you can’t
make everyone happy, the Cultural
Grants Committee has gone about
things in a very sensible way so far. In
fact, it has broken entirely new ground
by asking people concerned with drama,
the newly established Professional
Drama Council, how money should be
spent on drama.
The N.S.W. State Government’s dis-
tribution of funds, $30,000 this year for
drama, so far means only that nearly
everyone is getting a little. But it also
means that the Old Tote, which gets
substantial help from the University of
N.S.W. in provision of premises but
otherwise has been financially depend-
ent on the Elizabethan, now has another
patron.
The third factor which may deter-
mine the character and success of any
professional drama company in Sydney
is, of course, the Old Tote itself. The
Old Tote’s main people, Robert Quen-
tin, Robin Lovejoy, and Tom Brown,
have worked to a master plan with the
relentless logic of an underground
movement.
This year a grant from the N.S.W.
Cultural Grants Committee (the only
grant from it to the Old Tote, apart
from some funds for school perform-
ances) has enabled the National Insti-
tute of Dramatic Art, under the wing
of the Old Tote, to add a third, gradu-
ate year to its courses. The Old Tote
also has funds for a second season of
Australian plays at the Jane Street
Theatre.
The Old Tote, in fact, has burst the
bounds of its tiny, 180-seat theatre. It
has a flow of trained young people
coming to its stage, with the help of
which the co-director of the Old Tote,
Robin Lovejoy, estimates they could get
together a professional repertory theatre
within weeks.
Mr. Lovejoy had previous experi-
ence as director of the ill-fated Trust
Players, an experience which he re-
gards now as “history.” However, he
believes that actors in a repertory should
be on two-year contracts, in the main,
so that each year one half the com-
pany is in-coming and the other half
out-going. “Otherwise,” says Mr. Love-
joy, “actors become too secure. You
can’t have a theatre company like the
public service.”
Mr. Lovejoy believes that a profes-
sional repertory company might cost
$lOO,OOO a year (or, at least, should
be underwritten to that extent) and that
its finance should be guaranteed for five
years. The main reason why a com-
pany would not be able to work
more cheaply is that it should not be
forced by its budget to put on low-
cost or small-cast productions.
Mr. Lovejoy feels that a permanent
company would within a short time
work much more cheaply than an ad
hoc one. “At present when we have to
snatch an actor from TV we have to
offer much more than he would expect
if he were on a yearly contract,” he
said. “A permanent company can cre-
ate an income for itself. As well as the
main company, you can have one-man
shows, play-readings, lectures, even
the exploitation of the TV and film
market. Look at the return from some-
thing like Olivier’s Othello. And we
don’t have to have ideas about general
release; there is a world market for
university films.”
But great plans or hopes for Sydney
and Melbourne leave the rest of the
continent untouched. There will always
be difficulties with a small, scattered
population. However, Robin Lovejoy
feels it is important that each centre
should have at least the nucleus of its
own company.
He cited the Canberra Theatre, which
The Old Tote’s “School for Scandal” bursts the bounds of its tiny stage. Peter
Collingwood (Sir Peter Teazle), Helen Morse (Lady Teazle), John Norman
(Charles Surface), Ron Haddrick (Sir Oliver Surface), Jennifer Hagan (Maria),
Doreen Warburton (Mrs. Candour), and Ron Graham (Rowley)

has become merely a repository for
productions from other cities and was,
he said, in danger of becoming a white
elephant.
There is, however, no certainty that
if Sydney gets a professional repertory
company it will grow out of the Old
Tote. It might come from anywhere;
it might be the creation of a committee.
It doesn’t matter much. What is
vital is the conditions under which it
is to operate. After the experiences of
the past ten years, it is not hard to
believe that, unless the management
and professional functions are held sep-
arate and that the theatre people have
first and last say in their own field, it
may prove extremely difficult to find
anyone willing to take on the job at
all.
Art
The old nostalgia
By ELWYN LYNN
Pro Hart. Barry Stern’s Gallery, Syd-
ney.
TO CALL Pro Hart a curious artistic
phenomenon might seem to give his
work too much importance, but despite
the taunts of the avant-garde he is
able, after his high-priced sell-out, to
smile all the way to his gooey varnish
pots.
He doesn’t swim against the main-
streams of modern art whose existence
he ignores by practising a thoroughly
old-fashioned craft of pictorial anec-
dotes and vignettes of insect life. Be-
lieving that art is to record, commemor-
ate, and entertain, he is generally
scorned by the avant-garde that sees
him as a primitive Drysdalean bush-
wacker, loading his paintings with gol-
den syrup and sentiment. He is dis-
missed in much the same way as
Andrew Wyeth is in New York and
Bernard Buffet is everywhere; both these
artists, of course much superior to Hart,
have their passionate defenders, and
queues formed daily at the Whitney
retrospective for Wyeth early this year;
why is Hart liked despite his detrac-
tors?
Standing against the mainstream or
ignoring its existence is not the essen-
tial point: Francis Bacon and Sid
Nolan, one a giant in expressive por-
traiture, the other in narrative painting,
let the mainstream flow where it may.
Wyeth and Hart satisfy a nostalgia for
the countryside as repository of moral
fibre and folksiness: Wyeth’s rolling,
mystical hills, farms at dusk, watched
over by stalwart toiler and small
daughter, and the controlled, puritani-
cal zeal in his portraits are all cliches
of nostalgia. Not only do Wyeth and
Hart appear to be challenging the
"moral nihilism” of the city, but they
also seem to some to preserve the tradi-
tion of true art in a world gone awry
with non- and dis-figuration.
It is different with Bernard Buffet'
after the war his gaunt figures reflected
a general disturbance, and today a
deserted street or a stark still life can
carry conviction, but he has negated
his earlier anguish by making a few
black, jagged, and spiky lines pass for
it. In a similar way what ought to be
disturbing in Hart, and certainly is
in Nolan’s carcass paintings of 1952-3
is muffled by embalming sweetness. The
carcass of a dead, bloated bull floats
in a dreamy blue billabong while pallid
branches wave like flexible limbs from
Swan Lake. Ants make a delicate
luncheon of dragonflies which are about
to disappear into as lush a golden
Nirvana as you could imagine. One
large ant is presented against a lush,
Turneresque convulsion of reds, green,
blue, and orange-fawn as though all
the elements were celebrating its
smudgy existence. Recall what Dali did
with the hard, shiny, and efficient ant,
and you realise what pets Hart makes of
them.
In a year that is commemorating
Henry Lawson and his pessimistic view
of the outback, the lack of realism in
Dead Wool (Clifton Pugh has one a
grim painting on the same subject)
and The Gallows only emphasises the
prevailing golden sweetness. Both,
with their thin paint, calculated place-
ment of trees and small figures have
an air of colonial primitivism: Dead
Wool, has some delicacy and feeling,
but the slaughter poles in The Gal-
lows are, like many of his trees, mere
props.
Like his Melburnian forebears he
has a look at MYTH. His attempt to
illustrate Waltzing Matilda he has
an optical-shirted swagman (Bridget
Riley’s father?) stalking a jumbuck
shows how theatrical he is. He sets
the stage so that our nostalgia can go
for a stroll and, like Wyeth and the
Victorian anecdotalists, lets us supply
bits of the old, old story.
What makes him all the more
homely is that his style feels so
familiar; so familiar that some call it
tradition. His styles come by way of
colonial sketchiness, Drysdalean roman-
ticism (a small Ruins, 9” x 6” at $lOO,
is pure Drysdale) and the two Boyds
the veil from Arthur’s Bride 'making
do as dragonfly wings, and the heavy
gloom and half-hidden figures of Swag-
man 2 ($lOOO, about 4’ x 4J’) coming
from David, though the shirt might have
been borrowed from Charlie Black-
man. Well, at least it’s Australian
eclecticism. He wraps the Australian
image up: in billows of blue and golden
cottonwool and he satisfies a need
for the blinkered vision all around Aus-
tralia.
There is crispness and positiveness
in Dead Wool and Grasshoppers
that makes one suspect that there is an
artist hiding behind the Old Golden
Nostalgia; if only he’d drop the dis-
guises!


Theatre
Elegant "School"
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The School for Scandal. Sheridan. Old
Tote, Sydney.
SURROUNDED by the tropical, dark-
leafed Moreton Bay fig trees, the former
tin temple of Australai’s most constant
devotion is the scene of a lavish produc-
tion of Sheridan’s eighteenth-century
comedy of manners. The bewigged and
upholstered ladies, with their powder
and patches and barbed wit, are as far
removed from our informal, mini-
skirted times as an eighteenth-century
London drawing-room is from a tin
betting-shed. But, as far as appearance
goes, this production of “The School
for Scandal” is a triumph. Ron Reid’s
setting is elegant, simple, and efficient.
A push from the two maidservants and
the revolving stage turns to reveal the
alternative setting, and thus we move
from Lady Sneerwell’s dressing-room to
Lady Teazle’s dressing-room, from
Charles Surface’s lodging to Joseph
Surface’s lodging, without fuss or delay.
The costumes, all in shades of coffee
and cream, are made of mattress tick-
ing, the kind that looks like brocade,
glitter with gold thread and embroid-
ered beads, and froth with lace.
But the remarkable visual unity given
to the play by the designer is not re-
flected in Robin Lovejoy’s production.
Admittedly, the play itself is not en-
tirely consistent. The program note tells
us that “The School for Scandal” was
compounded of two of Sheridan’s earlier
plays, “The Slanderers” and “The
Teazles.”
The Teazles are much more realistic
than the slanderers, who are stock types
with stock names Lady Sneerwell,
Mrs. Candour, Mr. Snake, Sir Benjamin
Backbite. But if the Teazles are to be
played as realistically as they are in this
production, then it seems a mistake to
play the scandalmongers in such an
exaggeratedly stagy manner. They could
be played more realistically and be a
lot nastier.
By contrast, Sir Peter and Lady
Teazle are very sympathetic characters,
especially Sir Peter, and particularly as
played by Peter Collingwood. Lean of
figure and bright of eye, he is a well-
preserved fifty an important circum-
stance nowadays when we are more in-
clined to look askance at a big age-gap
in marriage and less inclined to think it
comic. Helen Morse gives a delightful
performance, both as the pert, newly
sophisticated London wife who is all
too apt a pupil at Lady Sneerwell’s
School for Scandal, and as the sub-
sequently chastened and contrite Lady
Teazle.
Of a capable, though in some cases
misdirected, supporting cast, John
Krummel is very funny in the tiny part
of the intoxicated Sir Harry Bumper.
lo get so much out of so small a part
shows what can be done by a good
comic actor. Ron Haddrick’s Dickensian
Uncle Oliver is a well-rounded portrait,
though not my idea of the character.
The Old Tote is the only one of the
“little” or serious theatres in Sydney
whose productions regularly reach an
acceptable, and discussable, standard.
The pity is that there is such a long
gap between each new production,
because, the theatre being so small, it
takes six weeks or more to accom-
modate the available audience. But then
Sydney could hardly claim to be noted
for its numerous, attractive, and com-
fortable “little theatres.” The Old Tote
and the Ensemble have been quite
attractive and comfortable considering
that they are both tin sheds.
Films
Son of James Bond
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Casino Royale. Various directors.
Nevada Smith. Director, Henry Hatha-
way.
I SUPPOSE “Casino Royale” is the
sort of movie you’re expected to sneer
at and certainly there’s plenty to criti-
cise: its plot is almost non-existent and
entirely idiotic; since several directors
had a hand in it, there is no unity of
style. All very true, but most of it
provides a remarkable amount of en-
tertainment.
There is no point in even trying to
summarise the plot, beyond saying that
the real James Bond isn’t Sean Con-
nery at all—he was only a ring-in for
diplomatic reasons. The original is
David Niven, now knighted for his
services to his country and living in
insanely elegant retirement. Forced by
circumstances to resume his old job
. . . No, I give up right there.
The changes of direction bring
curious shifts in tone to the film—for
instance, the sequences in the Berlin
school for spies are photographed with
“Caligari”-style impressionism, quite
effective in itself but out of character;
the sequence in the Casino indulges
Orsen Welles and his conjuring tricks
to a tedious degree; the final schmozzle
gets a bit out of hand. But in between
there’s a great deal of real fun to be
had. David Niven’s performance is
wonderfully stylish; Joanna Pettet turns
out to be a very comical girl, and
Deborah Kerr has a rare and delightful
chance to act the clown.
Undemanding entertainment, though
of a more sombre kind, is the only aim,
too, of “Nevada Smith,” based on an
early segment of the novel “The Car-
petbaggers,” which didn’t get into the
movie version. Nevada, the hero, son
of a white father and Indian mother,
finds his parents murdered and muti-
lated by three outlaws and sets out to
avenge them. It’s a straightforward, old-
style Western, with plenty of action,
beautiful outdoor photography, and
neat performances (even if Steve
McQueen does look a little too mature
for the youthful hero).
Music
Noble Bachauer
By DAVID SALTER
Gina Bachauer, Hurlstone Choral
Society, and Sydney Symphony
Orchestra. Town Hall, Sydney.
Cremona Quartet. Town Hall, Sydney.
GINA BACHAUER: what a com-
pletely noble and gracious musician she
is! Her interpretatitve approach for the
Beethoven Concerto No. 3 (C minor)
was testimony to the effectiveness of
natural simplicity. Throughout the con-
certo she interwove themes of anguish
and pain with sensitivity and control.
If there were any moments in the
performance which seemed prominent
they were, curiously, those awkward
passages between the cadenza and the
coda. In both the Allegro con brio
and the Rondo finale, Miss Bachauer
transformed these short, functional sec-
tions into moments of spellbinding
shadowplay.
As the only other work of the pro-
gram, Dixon’s account of Beethoven’s
Choral Symphony (“The Lop-sided”)
left one feeling low on the water with
an excess of musical ballast. Soloists
Marilyn Richardson, Florence Taylor,
Raymond McDonald, and Noel Melvin
fought valiantly to make more of their
parts than Beethoven allowed, while
the Hurlstone Choir (with reinforce-
ments of singing policemen) performed
with admirable gusto and reserves of
volume. After directing the first three
movements with an encouraging sense
of strategy, Dixon seemed to release his
larger ammunition far too early in the
Finale. The soloists arid choir were
forced to enter at almost their loudest
and there was an unwanted climax
early in the movement. Admittedly,
the. Finale tends to be a lead balloon
even in the best of performances, but
however bombastic and vulgar it may
be it cannot afford to end with the
anti-climax it suffered last week.
Melbourne’s Cremona Quartet chose
an inopportune time to give a recital
in Sydney. Not only are the splendid
sounds of the Smetana Quartet still
fresh in memory, but also our own
Sydney String Quartet is at present in
the midst of the Beethoven cycle. In
such company the Cremona most prob-
ably seemed worse than they really
are. Their recital of Mozart, Bartok,
and Schubert for Musica Viva was un-
comfortably dull. Mozart was blurred
and heavy-footed, Bartok was a little
more vigorous but inaccurate, and
Schubert became an ordeal rather than
a joy.


‘‘Barman, I’ll have a
Campari with chunks
of ice and a big shush
off soda.”
“Sorry, Sir, there’s no
Campari left.”
“That’s too bad it's
so gloriously pink and
cryptically bitter. All
right, I’ll try it with
vermouth and ice.”
“But I said there
wasn’t any Campari.”
“Oh I see. Did you
know it was made with
herbs from four con-
tinents macerated in
pure grape spirit in
oaken vats? 0.K., give
me Campari and gin
and don’t forget the
ice.”
“Listen. There-is-no-
Campari. It’s all gone!
No more. None left.
FINISHED! We have
everything else, but no
Campari.”
“Oh very well then,
I’ll have a Campari.”

Melbourne Film Festival
The long view
By PHILLIP ADAMS
WHERE THE ROMANTIC young
man of yesteryear was literary in his
orientation, seeing himself as Rupert
Brooke, nowadays he is more likely to
conceive of himself in filmic terms and
identify with Belmondo. Whereas his
predecessor read poetry or kept an
agonised journal, he plays it cool, he
walks in long-shot, zooms in for a nar-
cissistic close-up as he lights his Marl-
boro, and tries to keep his emotional
life modishly unemotional.
This cinematic self-consciousness is,
I firmly believe, crucial in the forma-
tion of contemporary manners, and was
effectively satirised in Theodore Ger-
shuny’s “American Roulette,” a 15-
minute study of a would-be Hugo Hef-
ner living his playboy fantasy, shown
at the Melbourne Film Festival. Sadly,
one of his girls breaks the rules by be-
coming emotionally involved. She
suicides, but our playboy stays resolute
in his detachment, seeing the incident
as an interesting scene in the continu-
ing and marvellous movie of his life.
“American Roulette” seemed as flippant
and unfeeling as its anti-hero, but soon
revealed the intensity of its anger and
disgust; awkwardly made and difficult,
but a memorable entry.
A university student, writing a thesis
on the Victorian Film Society move-
ment, distributed long questionnaires
to Festival members. On a quick check
of responses, the most popular film was
a British short called “The Tortoise and
the Hare.” This was a slick, but mind-
less stylistic exercise concerning a sort
of race between a jet-set blonde in an
E-type and an amiable Italian driving
a huge Pirelli truck. They drive from
Naples to Milan, and the film records
the journey in 40 minutes of familiar,
TV commercial virtuosity. As I com-
mented a few weeks ago, the aesthetic
of the cigarette ad is exercising a major
influence on Festival entries, and rather
than having had enough of them on the
telly, patrons respond to the familiar
style quite joyously.
Even now, the literary world tends
to take the patronising view that film
is merely an “audio visual aid.” So,
in retaliation, Holland’s “A Sunday on
the Island of the Grand Jette” thumbed
its lens at literature, subjecting books
to countless and unspeakable indigni-
ties for 21 avant-garde minutes. Books
were used as paving-stones, camouflage
for liquor cabinets, and weapons in
wild donnybrooks while six melan-
choly and anachronistic authors looked
on. The entry was spendidly photog-
graphed by Gerard Vandenberg, who
spent some years in Australia as a
fashion photographer, also filming Tim
BurstalPs “The Prize.”
With a script by Jaroslav Papousek
—who collaborated with Miles Forman
on “Loves of a Blonde” Czecho-
slovakia’s “Intimate Lighting” Was
plotless, formless, and delightful. I van
Passer’s comedy begins with the visit
of an old school friend to a small-town
home, and gets its humor by observing
the uneasy reunion, a country funeral
a family meal, an athletic grandmother
and a nostalgic drinking session. Paddy
Chayevsky headed a school of writers
who were trying to achieve the same
dimensions of humanity and naturalism
for American cinema, but beside “In-
timate Lighting” even “Marty” would
look as stylised as Peking Opera.
The best animations were “The
Samurai” and “Joachim’s Dictionary”
the first from Japan, the second from
France and both remote from Disney-
land. Each was drawn in a spindly line
owing much to Steinberg. “The
Samurai” had two microscopic mili-
tarists fighting over the favors of a
mountainous mistress, and “Joachim’s
Dictionary” had a single figure per-
forming fey little actions in response
to a series of words ranging from
“animation” to “zoology.”
“The Epic That Never Was” investi-
gated Korda’s ill-fated attempt to film
Grave’s “I, Claudius.” Von Sternberg
was hired to direct and Laughton to
star, but after week’s of histrionics from
Charles (who co-star Emlyn Williams
described as “a child and a genius”)
the production was scrapped. The
documentary ran the original rushes,
complete with Laughton’s fluffs and
tantrums and interviewed the person-
alities who were still alive and willing
to be evasive. Von Sternberg, it seemed,
couldn’t remember a thing. Merle
Oberon revealed herself as a supreme
and pathetic egotist. Emlyn Williams
sat back oozing charm and venom. But
the key question of Sternberg’s rela-
tionship with Laughton was glossed
over, and a mysterious moment in film
history remains shrouded.
Marginal jottings: “The Bride of
the Andes” was a colorful and sympa-
thetic study of Japanese colonists in
Peru; “Buster Keaton Rides Again
was a likable documentary portrait of
the ' sphinx-faced comic filmed just
before his death; “Flora” was an eye-
popping bit of pixilation and stop-
printing in which an untidy young lady
struggled mightily to dress herself
glamorously before the arrival of a
visitor, only to be peeled like a banana
within a second of his coming. “Petrol
—a kaleidoscopic abstract free-associat-
ing around the idea of the fuel
deservedly won the Festival’s award foi
the best short film. The Festival makes
no awards for features, but I would like
to present mulga-wood zoom lenses to
Bo Widerberg for “Love 65” and to
Hungary’s “The Roundup,” fat an
away the best of the Festival’s 133
entries.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Economic indicators point to
a gentle Federal Budget
THERE IS AN AMBIGUITY in the
latest lot of economic indicators that
could mean they are just the right sort
of thing for a pre-Budget period. For
in the midst of some major trends point-
ing satisfactorily up, there are others
facing gloomily down. It may be that
despite the fact that former levels of
production have been very quickly re-
gained, there is a good deal of slack still
to be taken up in important sectors of
the economy.
This possibility has its bright side. It
means that the Government should have
less reason for making it a tough
Budget. Next month’s employment
figures will be a critical test. But if they
beat out the trend for employment to
decline, despite the healthiness of other
Motor registrations ... very healthy
sectors of the economy, then there will
be an overwhelming case for a mildly
expansionary Budget which means a
continued expansion of Government
spending without any increases in tax-
ation. Some of the proposed increases
in Post Office charges could also be
reconsidered.
An enormous wheat harvest seems
assured this year, now that Victoria and
N.S.W. have had the necessary mini-
mum rain to get wheat on its way, and
the general level of farm prices seems
to be holding. There is no case for
holding back the economy for fear of
balance of payments difficulties.
There can be no doubt about the
ambiguity of last week’s fascinating crop
°f statistics. Building approvals and
motor registrations were very healthy
indeed, almost up to the levels of the
1965 boom. Vehicle sales were at an
annual rate of 430,000 and both housing
and other building work is going up in
greater volume than could possibly have
been foreseen seven or eight months ago.
But though the health of these sectors
is of importance, it has not yet rubbed
off on the general economy. In fact,
the overall figures for the month of
May looked surprisingly gloomy. Unem-
ployment rose substantially during the
month, even after allowing for the usual
seasonal increase. It is now at around
70,00 and despite the healthy trend
in most indicators it has been edging
upwards over the last year. Corres-
pondingly, job vacancies have been
diminishing. They stand currently at
39,000, the lowest level since the depth
of the mini-recession early last year.
Another indication of a certain hesi-
tancy in the economy comes from the
Wales-ACMA survey of business ex-
pectations. Fewer businessmen were
satisfied with their rate of operations
and fewer were confident that the gen-
eral business situation would improve
over the next six months. There is no
prospect of an increase in overtime
working.
New Zealand
It could be worse
NEW ZEALANDERS can take some
sort of comfort from the implication
in last week’s Budget that the Gov-
ernment did not feel the need to get
any tougher than it had in the special
measures earlier this year, even though
things are still bad enough for the
Dominion to be borrowing more Euro-
dollars at dreadful rates of interest and
drawing a further £7 million from the
IMF (which has already come up with
£lO.B million this year).
With New Zealand’s export problems
likely to get worse if Britain goes into
the Common Market (what does pro-
tecting New Zealand’s “essential inter-
ests” mean?), New Zealanders have
come out of the Budget a little better
than they might, particularly as the
Finance Minister, Mr. Robert Mul-
doon, said the current economic diffi-
culties (won’t somebody buy their
wool?) were the most serious faced
since the 19305.
With average luck, they could get
worse. For not only is there the Com-
mon Market threat but the Kennedy
Round was, as Mr. Muldoon com-
plained, a failure for New Zealand, as
it has few manufactured exports to the
tariff-cutting countries, and none of its
primary products got any special deals
like Australia’s on wheat. In addition,
the continued delay in getting any
move underway to expand international
liquidity is holding back New Zealand’s
export prospects.
Mining
Past achievements
THE PRESENT BLAZE of glory in
our mineral world shouldn’t blind us
to the industry’s past achievements. So-
it is appropriate that in Melbourne at
the moment, where the Australian In-
stitute of Mining and Metallurgy is
having its annual get-together, there’s
an exhibition on called, appropriately
enough, “The Fortune Finders,” which
the Institute and the University of Mel-
bourne archives have put together to
depict those achievements (including
the most recent ones). If possible, the
exhibits should be carted interstate so
all Australians could have the oppor-
tunity of seeing them. The earliest
mining document, relating to a WA
copper mine in 1846, is on display
together with many others of great
historical interest. The full range of
things to be seen covers letters, diaries,
maps, mining plans, photographs (some
of them blown up to almost cinema-
screen size), prints, implements,
machines, models, metal ores, and drill
samples.
In digging up a rare collection of
mineral samples, the organisers have
brought us right up to date with nickel
from Kambalda, and, as if to show that
this is only the latest in a long string
of discoveries by Western Mining Cor-
poration, they’ve produced a document
from the company’s early records when
it was “The Australian Gold and
Finance Company.” Viewers can also
sniff a fair sized cutting from an oil well
in Bass Strait and see the first piece
of bauxite from Weipa which led
Comalco on to its massive develop-
ments in aluminium. The übiquity of
Australia’s mineral resources is well
illustrated by samples of ore from every
State. But not, strangely enough, any-
thing from the Northern Territory. A
piece of uranium ore from them might
have been included at least to whet the
appetite of potential explorers, whom
the Federal Government has lately been
frowning on.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : Widespread rains in the wheat areas
of N.S.W. give excellent chance of record sowings for 1967,
but in the western sector of N.S.W. graziers are facing their
fifth dry winter. The N.S.W. branch of the Country Party
carried a resolution to ask the Commonwealth Government
to look at the case for a wool subsidy.
The labor market deteriorated in May, with unemployed
up to 66,185, and vacancies down.
The Queensland and Commonwealth Governments agreed
to a 15 percent rise in the wholesale price of sugar.
The modest rate of expansion of Australian manufacturing
activity recorded in the March quarter has been maintained
to June, according to a survey by the Associated Chamber
of Manufactures and the Bank of N.S.W. Deposits at the
eight major trading banks fell by s63m. to $5310m. in May.
The ACTU lodged an application with the Arbitration
Commission for a further interim decision to increase
margins in the metal trades award.
For the markets : BHP and mining stocks dominated
Australian share markets. A new system for transfers and
stamp duties comes into operation as from July 1, which
will simplify paperwork for investors, sharebrokers, and
company secretaries, and facilitate the use of electronic data
processing.
The pound sterling on the foreign exchange market in
London was at its lowest level against the SU.S. for nine
months, owing to anti-British repercussions in oil-producing
Arab States with large sterling balances. Investors on Wall
Street were cautious pending summit talks between President
Johnson and Premier Kosygin.
For companies: Nickel was still very much in the
spotlight. Market support for Western Mining shares waned,
if only temporarily, after Selection Trust Co. of London
announced it had obtained a ten percent shareholding . . .
for the second time directors denied knowledge of any reasons
for the rise in the price of Hill 50 shares . . . Great Boulder
Gold Mines expects to begin nickel exploration any day on
a location near Kalgoorlie, freehold of which is owned by
Hampton Properties of the U.K. . . . Metals Exploration, re-
cently popular for its nickel prospects, is making a 5c call
to finance the development of its Gibsonvale tin project, which
may produce $840,000 worth of tin metal a year.
Talks are being held with another company (CRA?) which
may be of benefit to shareholders of Consolidated Rutile .
Uranium Holdings, is re-negotiating with a large overseas
mining company (which is exploring in W.A.) for participation
in its Australian activities ... A partly owned subsidiary of
Mid-Eastern Oil announced, discovery of phosphate deposits
near Cooktown in North Queensland, but the acting Queens-
land Premier promptly commented that grades were only up
to six percent, far short of economic grades of 25 to 30
percent.
Thirty Australian financial institutions will have a ten
percent equity interest in the s3sm. Eastern Nitrogen Ltd.
fertiliser complex at Newcastle . . . Associated Australian Oil
found water instead of oil in its Duarran number 3 well and
is now going ahead with number 4.
Sydney real-estate developer Mr. W. G. Hodgekiss offered
to buy 20 percent of each shareholding in Federal Hotels
for 25c a share . . . Discussions are proceeding with Fibre
Containers directors which could lead to shareholder benefits
. . . and Farley and Lewers has acquired two more concrete
plants.
A one-for-eight par issue by Commercial Banking Co. of
Sydney will lift capital to sl9m. . . . meanwhile General
Credits, protege of the rival bank, the Commercial Bank of
Australia, earned more than slm. for its April year.
Revaluation of assets allows Queensland Cement and Lime
to make a one-for-two bonus, after which directors hope to
maintain the ten percent dividend . . . Fairymead expects to
start harvesting a record sugar crop early in July . . . and
Pioneer Sugar has bought a 70 percent interest in Mount
McConnel Pastoral Co., of Bowen.
MEN AND MATTERS
ON HIS WAY to an Australian intern-
ment camp in 1940, Mr. Fred Lowen
met Mr. Ernest Rodeck. In 1946 these
two shortish men put their brains and
their initials together to form Fler and
then proceeded to develop it into the
biggest furniture-making business in the
country with seven factories here and
two in New Zealand. In 1960 they got
it listed on Australian Stock Exchanges
and in 1966 sold it off to Australian
Controls Ltd., in which Ranco Corpora-
tion of the U.S. has a big (over 30
percent) stake for a million dollars.
They now run it as a subsidiary of
Australian Controls. In 1967 their fur-
niture bedecked our pavilion and
offices at Expo 67, chosen by the Gov-
ernment as being representative of the
best produced by the industry here.
If not exactly identical “twins,”
Lowen and Rodeck were born in the
same year, 1919, the one in Germany,
the other in Austria. They subsequently
studied engineering, Lowen in Berlin,
Rodeck in Vienna. Both were escapees
from the Nazis, Rodeck working as a
toolmaker and draughtsman in England
and Lowen continuing his studies
before they were interned. Here, they
both went to the Melbourne Tech, and
worked with pri-
vate firms before
starting Fler.
Rodeck, being
more in the man-
agement mould of
the two, is now
chairman a n d
managing direc-
tor, as well as a
director of Aus-
tralian Controls.
Lowen, also a dir-
ector is recog-
nised world-wide
as an outstanding

THE LATE SIR MACPHERSON
ROBERTSON was only 19 when he
started concocting confectionery over
a furnace made from a steel nail con-
tainer at his parent’s home in Fitzroy
in 1880. Today two sons, Norman
Napoleon and Eric Francis, now re-
spectively chairman and managing
director of Mac.Robertson (Aust.) Ltd.,
the firm he founded, are battling with a
problem which MacPherson couldn’t
have imagined in his wildest dreams.
The founder worked at his make-
shift plant five or six days a week, then
peddled his goods in the street on the
seventh. Buying an adjoining pro*
perty, he rapidly expanded the busi-
ness as sole proprietor until the early
19205, when he issued shares to key
employees. He died in 1945 at 84. The
firm went public in 1951.
Norman and Eric Robertson went to
Trinity Grammar, then the University
of Melbourne, and since war service
have been wrapped up in the firm and
the chocolate confectionery industry
in general. Holding a 35 percent inter-
est, the family grip is strong and neither
wants to let it go. This is probably the
most significant factor in their recom-
mendation of the Cadbury bid.


THE
CROESUS TOUCH
Lord Bail lieu:
More British
than the British
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IN 1961 WHEN an American airline
gave the late Lord Baillieu a plaque
to mark his millionth flying mile, the
gesture meant a lot more than mere
recognition of the patronage of one of
the world’s busiest business executives.
A little belatedly perhaps, it also put
a seal on the end of an age from which
Baillieu emerged, from being a com-
muter along imperial trade routes to a
fully fledged internationalist. It recog-
nised that the days were pretty well
over when a son like Clive Baillieu
would follow, in a matter of course, in
his father’s footsteps, first to Oxford or
Cambridge and then on to London to
carry the flag of Australian trade in-
terests in the context of an intimate
nexus.
Lord Baillieu’s passing last week at
77 in Melbourne, where he was born,
finds Australia in the throes of another
mining boom with different metals and
places to the ones on which the family
fortunes were built and on which Aus-
tralia’s mining links with Britain were
forged. It is no longer British capital
which is fertilising most of the new
developments, either. It is American,
and the emphasis is on its international
flavor.
Where Clive Baillieu differs most
from the other mining commuters of
his time is not so much that he
resided mainly in Britain (though hav-
ing a property here, also) and only
made occasional visits to this country
but rather that, for all his denials on
the point, he really became more
British than the British and in the end
was much more a servant of that
country than of his own. It was easy
enough to fall into the trap laid for
mm at Oxford; he even, as he once
told me, had regular supplies of beer
from the family brewery in Carlton
sent across to London to keep in
touch. But having rowed in a winning
Oxford crew and been admitted to
the Inner Temple (he was also a mem-
ber of the Victorian bar) and then
serving throughout World War I in
Europe (albeit with the Australian
forces), it is not so surprising that he
fell for the old world so readily or
that at the same time he essayed to
keep a foot in the new.
The latter was no problem, of course,
because the selling and indeed the
smelting end of the main Australian
mining companies (Zinc Corporation,
New Broken Hill and so on) in his
orbit was, in those days, mainly centred
on Britain. After a few years learning
the company drill with his father, fol-
lowing his return to Australia in 1919,
he went back to Britain to share with
the Robinsons the demanding tasks at
the London end, and took his wife,
Ruby, an Australian girl he married
in 1914, with him more or less for
good. He resumed his London life
with relish. When I first met him in
1934 at a shooting house party in Scot-
land he had become the compleat
English gentleman, as much at home
bagging grouse on the 12th of August
on the Scottish moors as at Henley,
resplendent in his Leander cap and
blazer in an official launch. By 1938
he had been accepted so thoroughly in
his English role that he was selected
to be a candidate for the seat of West
Swansea in the Commons (he with-
drew from the election at the last
moment for business reasons).
When World War II came the transi-
tion was so complete that this time
the British Government grabbed him
for some of the most vital war jobs and
he played a major part in ensuring that
Britain’s war factories were supplied
with the necessary raw materials. He
went to the United States in 1941 as
director-general of the British Purchas-
ing Commission, and after the U.S.A.’s
entry into the war became head of the
British Raw Materials Mission. He was
a member of the Combined Raw Mat-
erials Board and with his opposite num-
ber in the U.S.A. he recommended the
use of raw materials, decided how
shortages could best be made up, where
Britain and America should buy their
raw materials, which materials should
be pooled for the Allied nations and
friendly neutrals, and where synthetic
plants should be established. Return-
ing to Britain in October, 1943, he was
elected deputy president of the Federa-
tion of British Industries, but was back
in America a year later on an official
mission.
From 1945 to 1947, Baillieu was
president of the Federation of British
Industries and at this time the Labor
Government enlisted him for its new
National Investment Council and to
be chairman of a committee set up to
frame detailed proposals for the for-
mation of a British Institute of Man-
agement. He was a member of the
latter body’s first council and was sub-
sequently its first president. The Gov-
ernment also made him a governor of
the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research and a member of the
National Production Advisory Council
on Industry. As well as all this he
served, from 1947 to 1952, on the Gen-
eral Advisory Council of the BBC, and
in 1948 he led a U.K. trade mission
which negotiated an agreement with
Argentina.
The taking of all these appointments
from the Socialist Government in the
post-war years didn’t endear Baillieu
much to his top-drawer friends, especi-
ally those in the City of London. I
was in London at the time and wrote
the following comment in my diary of
February 11, 1946: “If it is true that
the Government is having difficulty in
finding the right men to fill the jobs
of the experts required to initiate
Socialism, then this is simply private
enterprise refusing to play. I see they
have called on Clive Baillieu, who has
17 directorships to cope with, as well
as the Federation of British Industries,
before he starts on his job with the
Government.”
I thought it rather ironic that,
although Clive Baillieu was in a recep-
tive mood for a higher title when he
was so ably serving the Socialist Gov-
ernment of Clement Attlee, it kept him
a knight when so many other of its
faithfuls were being elevated to the
peerage. Anyway, in 1952 a Conserva-
tive Government decided to do the right
thing and he became the first Baron
Baillieu.
Lord Baillieu was in every sense of
the word the business economist that
any top management man worth his
salt has to be although you won’t find
the name of Baillieu in the economic
text books. But this member of the
clan had a hearty appetite for economic
principles all the same, and an even
keener one for their business applica-
tions. The bookshelves at both his
“seats,” Parkwood in England (a mag-
nificent place built by W.L. 62 years
ago) and Sefton in Victoria, are proof
of that. In his younger days, anyhow,
he kept company with economists. Sir
Douglas Copland in his heyday used
to write his letters when in England
from 95 Gresham St., the home of
Zinc Corporation and other Baillieu
companies. And in recent years when
Copland has been living near the Bail-


lieu property at Macedon, it is a fair
bet the two have often got together.
Baillieu was also a devotee of Keynes,
and told me once with relish that he
brought the first copy of Keynes’ “The
Economic Consequences of the Peace”
to Australia after World War I.
If the world in general and Britain
in particular would seem to have bene-
fited more than Australia from Bail-
lieu’s economic expertises this country
came in for its fair share of economic
assistance and advice from him. Per-
haps, as Sir Robert Menzies implied
at his memorial service address last
week, he was valued foremost by Aus-
tralian Governments and companies as
a contact and adviser at the hub of
world affairs, a man of stature with
the ear of those who decide things. He
could open doors, just as W. S. Robin-
son could or Lord Bruce can still do
now. Looking at London from this
distance we tend to under-estimate the
significance of such a role. Even if it
is probably less vital these days to
have such people in London and more
important than it used to be to have
them stay in Washington and Tokyo,
we can be mighty thankful for Baillieu’s
presence there in the past.
Although this didn’t happen so much
after Baillieu began to blossom on the
international front, early in his Lon-
don career the Australian Government
had the benefit of his services as its
official representative on a number of
committees involving its overseas in-
terest. When I joined the staff of the
old Imperial Economic Committee for
a brief spell in 1936-37, I found that
Baillieu (then plain Mr.) was one of
two official Australian representatives
on it. There were many others.
On his frequent visits here cover-
ing half a century, Lord Baillieu seldom
failed to make a telling comment or
two on how we were going and usually
pinpointed a weakness in economic
policy. He was, for instance, constantly
hostile toward what he called the
“range and paraphernalia” of restric-
tions on imports during the 19505. He
also believed it an illusion to suppose
that the great complex business of a
country like ours can be run by a few
wise men sitting in Canberra. I' guess
his friend Menzies turned a deaf ear
to that one.
Like W. S. Robinson, Baillieu had
boundless faith in Australia’s potential
for development. But when here early
in 1960 he told us bluntly that we were
in danger of messing things up. Lord
Bruce had said more or less the same
thing on a visit here a couple of
months previously. Baillieu warned that
“the very momentum of advance, the
forward urge, may unloose forces that
could be self defeating.”
In the business world, Lord Baillieu
will be remembered more for his huge
capacity for directorships than his gen-
eral economic gifts. Even neglecting
the complex of the companies in the
Baillieu family orbit, the number of
directorships Clive held during his life-
time was fantastic.
SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
On how to join
the mining club
with safety
WELL, IT’S THAT TIME of the year
again. From now on in the dark of the
night, while the city sleeps, accountants,
auditors, and computer operators will
burn gallons of midnight oil on their
traditionally feverish last-minute rush
to produce this year’s crop of annual
balance sheets. When it’s all over and
the 1966-67 models are released, what
will we have? Judging by the results of
the first half of the year, and the gen-
erally healthier Government statistics
now being released, for most sections a
much improved year looks imminent.
The drought which affected so many
areas of industry last year is over, there
has been plenty of reasonably cheap
money available for expansion, and the
gross national product has risen 13 per-
cent.
As usual the first companies past the
post with their balance sheets will be
the financiers (after all they only have
to count their money). The pick up in
motor vehicle registrations and the
relatively lower interest rates for bor-
rowing are only two reasons why this
sector should fare really well. Austra-
lian Guarantee Corporation and Associ-
ated Securities look the best bets. The
agricultural equipment industry also
looks poised for a good harvest after
a lean time last year. Massey Ferguson,
which is an unlisted company, has given
a glimpse of things to come with a half
yearly profit of more than double that
of last year. Perhaps I was a bit hasty
in selling off Waugh & Josephson the
other day; anyway, I’ve still got
Chamberlain Holdings as my represen-
tative in the industry. Other sectors
which should do well this year are
banking and retailing.
One industry I’ve steered clear of
for a while now is mining. Most odd
for a speculator, I know, but I did it
intentionally to try to show that even
in the dull old industrial market there
are still profits to be made. Also I must
admit I’ve been a bit wary about the
wild rush to “join the mining club.”
The now much-quoted but little-heeded
article in the London “Financial Times”
about the “unpleasant smell of burnt
fingers” that could arise from the nickel
rush roughly sums up my sentiments
on the topic. Perhaps time will prove
me wrong, but I’m afraid I can still
remember similar past crazes where in
fact, people ended up with no fingers
Just to show I’m not completely
biased, I’ve now entered the mining
market again, not in nickel but in zinc
The company is E.Z. Industries. I t
operates mines on the west coast of
Tasmania and has a smelting operation
at Risdon. It produces zinc, super-
phosphate, sulphate of ammonia, and
sulphuric acid. In addition, it has
further interests in the fast-growing
fertiliser industry through a one-third
holding in Nitrogen Fertilisers Pty.
Ltd., and is active in the exploration
field. Despite a slight easing in the
overseas zinc price, the company’s
increased production figures for May
still make the stock look a bit under-
valued at the current price of $2.90.
Not having made anything out of my
S. A. Brush rights, I decided, like
Flarold, to go all the way and shelled
out $200 to take up my full entitlement
of 400 shares. I still feel that I could
clean up here.
This week, thanks to the rumor
industry, I was finally able to sell my
longest-standing stock, Gold Mines of
Kalgccrlie. The rumor lifted the price
of the stock from $1.10 to $1.55 in a
week. Selling out at $1.45, I was able
to make a reasonable profit instead of
the loss to which I was rapidly becom-
ing resigned. The rumor, which saved
the day, was that the company, along
with Hill 50 Gold Mines and North
Kalgurlie (1912), was applying for a
nickel lease at Lake Rebecca in W.A.
All three companies have now denied
such an intention, but in the interim I
was able to “have an out.”
My Evans Deakin rights were also
sold this week for a round profit of one
cent each. I could probably do better
here if I were willing to hang on and
take up the issue but I’m not sure I
can afford it. Also the price fluctuation
over the past few weeks made me a bit
nervous.
Question of the moment: Is Life-
savers raising its nominal capital from
$3 million to $10 million so it can help
out its old mate MacRobertsons? Keep
tuned for further developments.

WILD CAT PAGES
ACI and the building recovery
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THE IMPLICATIONS OF the better
building and motor registration figures
(see page 43) have not yet really shown
through in the stock market. But there
can be no denying their importance,
particularly for companies in the build-
ing supply trades.
There are some impressive looking
companies in the building supply busi-
ness that have been fairly cheap recently
and could provide some sound buying
opportunities (our Melbourne market
man pointed to some of the building
and construction companies themselves
last week). Among these are plumbers’
supplier John Mcllwraith, whose
shares have been subjected to some
heavy selling pressure in the last year
or so and which are still down around
the $1.12 mark (it’s not so long since
they were over the $2 mark). This
stock is excellent value to yield 6.7 per-
cent on the well-covered 15 percent
dividend. Another is G. E. Crane, the
Sydney company that is in the same
business, but also has a big aluminium
and copper trade, and whose shares are
now down around the $4.95 mark after
being as high as $5.40 in this, their
centenary year.
But the best of them all is the
übiquitous Australian Consolidated In-
dustries, which the Chartist recom-
mends below. This stock has been a
staunch favorite of this page for about
12 months, when it was selling around
the $2.75 level. (It is now $3.15). Now
that a building recovery has added its
support to the already significant attrac-
tions of this stock in other fields, the
Chartist’s early projection of $4.80
seems easily attainable.
Not only does ACI have the benefit
of glass in the building improvement,
but since the acquisition of the F. W.
Williams half-interest with the St.
Regis Paper company of the U.S. in
the local Sisalkraft operation, it has a
big stake in that part of building, too.
Then it has the glass can running for it,
the continued trend toward bottled
foods and improved results from its
engineering and other diversifications.
But it is in the fast-growing fibre pack-
aging industry that ACl’s greatest
growth potential seems to lie.
Here’s some useful advice: in the
same week that Speculator is deciding
to sell his long-standing holding of Gold
Mines of Kalgoorlie shares, the Chartist
has decided to renew an earlier recom-
mendation for the stock. The Chartist
says: GMK was recommended in an
earlier issue but failed to hold the up-
trend and fell back to the base level
around 80 cents. The market action
over recent weeks has reversed this
situation and a target of approximately
$2.60 would be possible for this stock.
J. Blackwood prepares to rise
LAST YEAR’S PROFIT of J. Black-
wood & Son Ltd. was not as good as it
looked; that for the year just ending
will probably be better than it appears;
and next year’s should be (and look)
excellent. For Blackwood has been go-
ing through a period of preparing for
the future, of building a new warehouse
and streamlining its operations in such
a way that it will be able to cope with
much larger turnovers without becoming
involved in very great additional ex-
penditure.
In the meantime, its profits, par-
ticularly those for 1965-66, have
suffered (a bit more than the accounts
for last year suggest). Had it not been
for the acquisition of some additional
subsidiaries and for the inclusion of
some non-recurring expenses in the pre-
vious year’s result, the 1965-66 profit
would probably have fallen by $20,000
or so instead of rising by $55,000. As
it was, earning rate on the considerably
higher average capital eased back a bit
to below 30 percent.
But no wonder the 1965-66 accounts
were dull; there were so many things
working against the company. When the
company has settled down into its new
home, when the economy shows that it
is really going along at a better pace,
when its new subsidiaries are providing
a full year’s return, then J. Blackwood
will be turning in profits that will be
The Chartist says:
AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES is an
investment-grade stock worthy of investors’ attention at the
present time. After the 60 percent uptrend from late 1961
to early 1962, this stock has moved in a downtrend which
could be described as a pause in the long-term growth phase.
It now shows promise of breaking out of the consolidation
pattern and a first move to about $3.60 is indicated where it
would encounter resistance selling from the 1962 peak. The
base suggests a target of $4.80 and a longer term move up to
about $7.60. Last sale price on 20/6/67, $3.18.

much better even than 1966-67’s fore-
cast 32 percent on capital.
Last month directors predicted a 32
percent earning rate for the current
year to June when reporting that group
sales were “higher” for the nine months
to March 31 than at the same time
in 1966 (they were up 21 percent at
the half year), and profit “was well
maintained.” Sales for April and May
showed “an increasing trend.” There
have been no alterations to capital in
the financial year now drawing to a
close, so the 32 percent earning rate
forecast gives a profit of approximately
$368,000 for 1967, or about a 12 per-
cent improvement on the company’s
declared net profit for 1966 of $328,268.
This is rpughly in line with the 13
percent left in half-year profits to
$165,553. Whether the capital profit
on the sale of Sussex Street premises
is included in company calculations is
not clear, but it is not a large item.
This will represent a modest but
satisfying improvement in what could
have been a difficult year for Black-
wood’s (some of its competitors found
it so), particularly as last year’s ne.t
profit was not as good as the 20 p er *
cent lift reported by the company would
suggest. Based on the tax provision
taxable group net profit was only about
nine percent up on the year rather
than 20 percent; and if the once-and-
for-all provisions of 1965-66 are dis-
counted, the group net profit rose by
only four percent despite the huge
additions to capital and the big lift
in sales during the year.
The diminishing role of the parent
company and the increasing significance
of the subsidiaries can be seen from
the fact that parent company sales
which make up two-thirds of the group’s
turnover, rose by 11 percent, but its
profit went up by only about seven
percent (and that is taking the com-
pany’s profit figures at face value
rather than at the tax commissioner’s
view). For the tax man dropped his
tax charge on the parent company by
$11,090 to $182,470, as the “once-and-
for-all” provisions (which do not appear
to have been spent) of the previous
year were not regarded as a tax de-
duction. The result of all this was that
the parent company contributed pro-
portionately less to the group than
ever before; it provided only two-fifths
of the group sales rise and barely one-
fifth of the group’s profit increase. So
the parent’s proportion of group profit
fell from three-quarters down to two-
thirds, and its share of sales dropped
from 85 percent to 65 percent.
This parent company profit is purely
a trading one, as the company has not
taken in subsidiary profits up to now,
although presumably it will be in the
future as the significance of the sub-
sidiaries continues to increase. Most,
probably three-fifths or so, of the parent
company’s turnover is in engineering
supplies, so that the company’s steel
wholesaling shares the remaining two-
fifths with its merchandising of non-
ferrous metals (mainly copper tubes).
But it is no longer good enough to
think of Blackwood’s simply as this sort
of merchandising company. Now its sub-
sidiaries are becoming a very significant
part of the operation and it will need
a healthy lift from the company’s tradi-
tional operations to hold back the trend
to the subsidiaries playing an even
greater role this year.
The group’s wages bill rose 28 per-
cent, exceeding the 20 percent sales rise,
as an indication of rising labor costs in

successful fund-raising
methods outlined ....
5 STATE SEMINARS, JULY, 1967
Today, more than ever before, charities, churches and clubs have a
need to know and apply the most advanced principles of 'big-money'
fund raising. Unless the means of earning full public support are known
many vital projects will be lost to the community.
It is to meet this modern need, that Australasian Seminar Services are
conducting Seminars in five states of Australia (and, also, New Zealand)
to assist all persons connected with any organisation or institution
desiring public funds. Voluntary service club members are invited,
in addition to the paid secretary and Church Laymen.
Guest lecturer is Mr. John E. Brinton of Ketchum Inc., Pittsburgh,
U.S.A., the world's largest firm of fund-raising specialists. Seminar
Chairman is Mr. Everald Compton, one of Australia’s most experienced
fund-raising consultants.
The Seminars are held on Discussion Group lines, in comfortable
surroundings. Refreshments and supper are provided.
Attendance fee is $lO, and the venues for the Seminars in the
different States are as follows:

this industry as well as the costs of
moving into new premises and gearing
u p to expected higher sales (apparently
a factor also in the 30 percent increases
in debtors and stock). Intriguingly, most
of the rise in stock was in the parent
company, while all but a fraction of
the rise in debtors came from the sub-
sidiaries, as parent company debtors re-
mained remarkably steady.
One of the attractive features of J.
Blackwood’s present set-up is the new
warehouse and office at Lidcombe,
which was occupied at the end of
March. It has spent $1 million on the
land and new buildings at Lidcombe,
and the warehouse now occupies three
acre*: of the 4f-acre site. The costs
associated with the move were covered
in the 1965-66 accounts. In the old
premises in Sussex Street the company
was overtrading out of five floors of a
small building. At Lidcombe, Black-
wood now has facilities for general
engineering supplies, for everything in
its product range excapt steel. Steel
trading will continue from the steelyard
and bulk store established in 1955 on a
l£-acre site at Waterloo.
From the 1966 accounts it was appar-
ent that the company had spent
$250,000 on land and buildings, and
there were commitments for capital
expenditure unprovided at 1966 balance
date of $643,358. The capital expendi-
ture relating to Lidcombe and the
extension of Canberra premises at a
cost of $120,000 were completed in
the 1966-67 financial year. The neces-
sary funds were provided by the one-for-
ten issue at 100 percent premium in
May, 1966, which raised $209,426 by
two placements totalling 100,000 shares
at a premium of $2.75, raising $375,000
in December, 1965, and March, 1966,
and the balance by a life company in
the form of a long-term loan. This
would be the first loan money except
from bankers (in 1966 up from $551,000
to $607,000) that the company has
obtained.
The two building and plumbing sup-
plies subsidiaries, A. E. Baker, of Parra-
matta (acquired in 1961), and W. R.
McKerrow Pty. Ltd., of Canberra
(acquired in 1964), and now known
as J. Blackwood and Son (Canberra)
Pty., are both now slanting their activi-
ties to those of the parent. Two acquisi-
tions last year, Cescolite Pty. Ltd., of
Auburn (manufacturing fluorescent light
fittings and marketing electric cables),
and Australian Light and Power Co.
Pty. (which was the principal supplier
to Cescolite) gave J. Blackwood its first
diversification of interests. The new sub-
sidiaries were profitable when taken
over, and are “going extremely well,”
with no digestion problems.
It has no desire to get into aluminium
distribution as management cannot see a
profit in it.
Takeovers have been few and made
to utilise the market premium to ensure
a higher earning rate on capital
employed. This has enabled the com-
pany to offer shareholders a one-for-ten
bonus in September, 1964. As they sub-
scribed 100 percent premium to the
one-for-ten issue of May, 1966, it seems
a fair bet that this will be returned tn
them some time in the not too distant
future as a bonus. (Other than these
issues shareholders had a one-for-two
par issue in June, 1959.) Share
premium reserve was $1,045,136 at 196&
balance date, almost equal to issued
capital, and besides this there was a
general reserve of $930,000. So current
prices a little below $3.80 (to yield 4.2
percent on dividends and 7.3 percent
on earnings) still leave plenty of room
for improvement, even though they are
up near their best for the year.

The Melbourne Market
Potters like leaders—and WMC
WITH THE FINANCIAL YEAR
coming to a close, the research boys at
lan Potter & Co. have picked out ten
stocks which they believe have better
than average growth prospects over the
next 12 months or so. They have
tended toward leaders, pointing out that
the Melbourne 50 Leaders index gained
about 16 percent in 1966-67, a level
of growth which “most investors would
no doubt be happy to obtain. ” Admit-
ting that a rising index does not guar-
antee investment success, they ernpha-
sise that the choice of stocks is vital
and should extend to between five and
fifteen companies.
These companies should be well man-
aged (how the investor decides this is
beyond me) and spread over a range
of industries so as to avoid dependence
on any one sector of the economy. As
the industries with the best growth
propects generally do not contain stocks
which are yielding very well from divi-
dends, there is a bit of a problem for
the investor seeking incomes as well as
capital growth for the year. For these
people, Potter suggests placing half
their cash in fixed interest securities
to take advantage of the current high
interest rates.
Four of the ten growth stocks in the
li s t are suppliers of basic commodities
Coal & Allied, CSR, Hamersley and
WMC. Although Coal & Allied is
losing sales to the gas industry and the
railways, Potter expects this to be more
t han offset by the large coal export
contracts with Japan and increasing
sales to power stations. The company
lifted sales and profits in the last De-
cember half-year, despite the Newcastle
shipping delays which brought heavy
demurrage charges and affected lesser
groups like R. W. Miller,
CSR increased its pre-tax profit in
the year to March 31; in the current
year, there is an improved outlook for
its established interests in sugar,
chemicals, and building materials,
Looking further ahead, profits should
see marked gains once the Mt. Newman
iron-ore project starts to return divi-
dends. A similar view is held for the
interest the group holds in the vast
Gove bauxite deposits, along with the
longer-range plans for establishing an
alumina plant.
The market for Hamersley appears
to have bottomed (Potter should know]
as most of the short-term sellers have
now been replaced by long-term hol-
ders, and a gradual firming in prices
can be anticipated. “At a time when
all metal stocks are booming on the
Exchanges, Hamersley stands out as one
of the most assuring mining investments
for the long-term investor,” Potter says
Since the estimates in the group’s pros-
pectus were prepared, it has pressed on
with an expansion program designed to
double the capacity to ship ore by the
end of 1968. “This move no doubt an-
ticipates the growing demand for
Hamersley iron from Japan, Europe,
and the U.S.A., and must inevitably
enhance the nearer term profitability
forecasts.”
Nerves of steel would be needed to
buy WMC, “yet the extent and richness
of the nickel reserves being revealed
suggest even higher prices.” Capital is
relatively small (a hint at another
issue?) and nickel is one of the most
stable metals. Potter says the announce-
ment of reserves will be the real key
to market prices; the company is
rapidly moving to a point where it is
a true investment situation.
The fifth stock on the list is CUB,
an old Potter favorite. Members of the
early post-war baby boom are now
entering the drinking age group, so beer
consumption should rise at a faster rate
than the growth in population. A more
direct boost to profits will be provided
by the recent increase in wholesale Vic-
torian beer prices. It is estimated that
this increase will add $1.2 million
annually to CUB’s net profits—in 1965-
66 these came out at $7.1 million. On
the subject of Courage, Potter says “at
its present level the share price
(CUB’s) seems to fully reflect any
small market loss that may occur with
the advent of a rival brewery in 1968.”
Food is naturally an industry set
for good growth and two of its best per-
formers have been selected Frozen
Food and Piet. Frozen Food lifted
profit 35 percent in the nine months
to March 31. To meet the galloping
demand for its products the company
is building a new factory at Keon Park
(Vic.), which should start operations
later this year and strengthen the group
even further. Piet earned enough extra
profit in the seven months to January
31 to maintain a 30 percent earning
rate on capital increased by a 18-for-
-100 share issue. The company has com-
pleted its building program at Notting
Hill (Vic.) and undertaken some plant
and equipment expansion which will
produce a full year’s benefits in 1967-68.
Potter sees further growth for the
group from increasing per capita con-
sumption of frozen vegetables (Frozen
Food operates mainly in the snacks
line) and the success it is having t n
penetrating the N.S.W. market.

formance is Consolidated Press Hold-
ings. The group’s television interests
will be strengthened by the recent mer-
ger which lifted its shareholding in
Television Corporation from 36 to 75
percent. The five-cent rise in the price
of The Australian Women’s Weekly is
expected to be enough to offset rising
costs and lift earning rate at the same
time; Consolidated Press already covers
the 20 percent dividend two-and-a-half
times.
(In steel and engineering there is
BHP (oil and gas too, of course). Pot-
ter recommended the shares last Nov-
ember at $5.84 and, despite the envi-
able price increase since, feels there is
still room for further appreciation, as
the developments already under way
take shape and the exploration pro-
gram continues. On top of steel, iron
ore and gas (the nickel prospect in
Queensland does not get a mention),
the company is a half-owner of what
seems likely to be Australia’s richest
oil field. The immensity and diversifi-
cation of interests which the company
is preparing for are not too distant.
The tenth stock is the ever-growing
Myer group. Profit rose substantially in
the last December half. A big period of
growth lies ahead wfith the opening of
regional centres at Ringwood in Octo-
ber (five months ahead of schedule)
and Cheltenham a year later. Inter-
state, major extensions are planned for
the stores in Brisbane and Hobart, so
they are ready for the 1967 Christmas.
In March next year the group moves
in as principal tenant in Adelaide’s
Marion shopping centre. Myer shares
have been recommended before in these
columns. They are worth Buying, if
only for the reason that Myer has
proved itself one of the few retailers
incapable of delivering nasty surprises
to its shareholders (thanks to good
management?).
GREENBUSHES TIN NL, which has
recently made a strong recovery from
its early near-disastrous ore-treatment
problems, is also fortunate on the
strength of tantalum prices. For stan-
dard 40 percent grade ore, 2000/- to
2200/- a unit has been quoted for many
months.
In less than two years prices almost
tripled, and there has been little
reaction despite a recent sale from
U.s. stockpile. U.S. stocks of the
material are believed to be low, more-
over, and further such sales are not
likely to be a problem.
Most producers have committed their
output at least for 1967, while there
appears to be no large unsatisfied
demand so prices could continue at
around 2000/- stg. a unit (about
SU.S.I2| a lb.) for some months.

Mining gets more important
at Electrolytic Zinc
ALTHOUGH EZ INDUSTRIES LTD.
could be regarded basically as an
“industrial” stock because of its prin-
cipal zinc refining activity at Risdon,
its direct mining interests are substan-
tial and will, in the medium term, be-
come much more important once the
second shaft at its Rosebery mines has
been sunk.
This company has not made a new
issue of shares since 1956, when a capi-
tal reconstruction brought paid-up
capital in the new holding company to
$36 million. Since then EZ’s share price
has fluctuated (usually in sympathy
with the world zinc price) between
$1.12 (the 1962 low) and $2.75 (the
1966 high) and currently stands at
$2.67 to yield 6.7 percent from the 18
percent dividend covered 1.2 times by
the 1965-66 earnings. Little overall
growth in EZ’s share price has taken
place in the last decade, however,
since the 1957 average price was $2.17.
Subsequent inflation of prices has cer-
tainly more than offset the 23 percent
market growth that has, in fact, thus
far taken place.
In retrospect, the market took a very
harsh view of EZ’s lower profit in the
first half of the current financial year.
EZ’s share price declined to $2.08, at
which price they would yield an attrac-
tive 7.2 percent even if the dividend
rate were to be cut to, say, 15 percent.
As the company’s bonus payments to
its employees are geared to its dividend
rate, it may be presumed that manage-
ment will make every effort to pay the
highest possible dividend. The fact that
the company generally pays out around
80 percent of its earnings is sufficient
evidence of this presumption.
Ignoring these short-term considera-
tions, the most important medium-term
aspect of EZ seems to be the decision
to sink a second shaft at its Rosebery
mines on the west coast of Tasmania.
The ore produced from these mines is
among the richest mined in Australia,
and in 1965-66 is assayed 17.65 per-

Copper concentrates
(’OOO tons) 10 11 9 10 11
(a) All figures are overstatements since this
refers to metal in concentrates and does not allow
for losses at Risdon.
This table shows that the zinc con-
centrates from EZ’s Rosebery mines
provide about 30 percent of the total
zinc concentrates treated at Risdon (the
remainder comes mainly from Broken
Hill South and North Broken Hill),
Consequently, as the present shaft at
Rosebery is working virtually at full
capacity, once the second shaft has been
sunk, EZ will be in a position to sup-
ply up to two-thirds of its Risdon zinc
concentrate requirements (assuming
zinc refining capacity is kept steady at
the present level of around 145,000
tons). This is likely to place EZ in a
better bargaining position with the
“Barrier” companies for their zinc
concentrates.
The “returning charge” imposed by
EZ (to cover smelting and transport
costs in particular) in practice is sub-
ject to competitive pressures, and
should swing in its favor once it has
spare mining capacity at its own mines.
More importantly, EZ’s mining profits
(on which it does not have to pay
royalties unlike the N.S.W. “Barrier”
companies) should increase substantially
when the second shaft is in operation.
Unfortunately, unlike other leading
Australian mining companies, EZ’s
balance sheets do not contain many
details of its mining operations. In
particular, no mention is made of the
operating costs per ton of ore mined
at Rosebery. However, a very rough
“rule of thumb” for calculating the
order of magnitude of operating costs
is to compare the amount of ore mined
per day with the total number of em-
ployees. In EZ’s case, the total number
of employees at its West Coast mines
usually varies between 700 and 750
(including staff) and the ore mined
each day approximately 1000 tons.
By contrast, in 1965-66 each Mt.
Isa employee “produced” about 2\ tons
of ore. This suggests that EZ is a rela-
tively high-cost producer. Presumably,
this is related to the fact that the
present Rosebery shaft is quite narrow
and subject to “bottlenecks.” It is, there-
fore, quite feasible that future operating
costs could be reduced somewhat. In
this connection EZ’s acquisition of the
Emu Bay Railway Company Ltd. should
enable Emu’s workshops to be utilised
entirely for the benefit of EZ’s own
mining operations.
Of course, the foregoing preoccupa-
tion with the mine expansion program
(which will take “some years before
the new shaft is in operation”) raises
the question of its financing (estimated
at around $lO million in total, but far
less on an annual basis.) EZ’s negotia-
tions with the Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd. for the realisation
of its 23 percent interest in the esti-
mated 1 million tons of zinc contained

Underwritten by A. C. GOODE & CO., Members of The Stock Exchange of Melbourne
in the Port Pirie slag dump have con-
tinued for some time now and may not
be concluded until the $15 million
plant, designed to produce electrolytic
zinc, is operating efficiently.
In addition to EZ’s annual cash
flow, which is at least $2 million (its
depreciation provision), the company
has an investment portfolio of listed
securities which, as at 30th June, 1966,
cost $4,668,672. However, based on
prices as at 16th June, 1967, EZ’s hold-
ings in APPM, BHP, ICIANZ, Mt. Isa,
New BH, North BH, and WMC were
WO rth almost $12 million (or 33 cents
per EZ stock unit).
It would seem, therefore, that EZ
should be able to finance its second
shaft at Rosebery, and its proposed
plant to treat accumulated zinc-bearing
residues at Risdon without necessarily-
approaching shareholders.
So far as EZ’s well-known zinc refin-
ing activities are concerned, the current
outlook is for increased competition in
the local market. At present EZ is the
only local producer of high-grade re-
fined zinc, even though the Sulphide
Corporation’s Cockle Creek smelter
came into production in 1961. How-
ever, the Sulphide Corporation has an-
nounced plans to build a $3.1 million
zinc-refining plant with a capacity of
35,000 tons of high-grade zinc a year.
This refinery, which is scheduled for
commissioning early in 1968, will refine
about 65 percent of the Cockle Creek
smelter’s zinc output. In addition, as
mentioned, BHAS’s Port Pirie electro-
lytic plant is now being installed.
On the export scene, where EZ sold
over 63 percent of its zinc and zinc
alloys in 1965-66, the company reported
in its 1966 accounts that premiums
for high-grade and special high-grade
zinc in some export markets were
reduced in the latter part of the 1965-66
year as increased quantities of these
grades became available from compe-
titive sources.
Similarly, the 1966 chairman’s
address noted that indicators pointed
to a possible intensification of the com-
petitive conditions that characterised
the first six months of 1966. The report
stated there would be downward pres-
sures on grade premiums and a reduc-
tion in the level of returns that EZ
had obtained in recent years.
In all the circumstances, however,
EZ shares appear good buying, even at
current relatively high levels, due
mainly to the promising medium-term
outlook for its mining activities. In
addition, there is always the “specula-
tive” element, since the company’s cur-
rent annual exploration expenditure of
around $750,000 could well turn up
something of interest.

Mining
The salt of the stockmarket
WHILE LAKE LEFROY, in Western
Australia, is proving to be the likely
birthplace of possible fortunes from
nickel mining, it should not be for-
gotten that it is also likely to be the
site of a much more humble mineral
venture that of salt extraction.
Humble though this type of mining
may be, it could, nevertheless, prove
quite rewarding for the companies in-
volved, due to the relatively cheap cost
of development and extraction. Norse-
man Gold Mines N.L., which is already
producing pyritic sulphur at Norseman,
has leases over Lake Lefroy for the
purpose of extracting salt. In this ven-
ture it has been joined by the Sumi-
tomo organisation of Japan, which has
agreed to joint development as well as
the purchase of salt production. Ex-
ports are scheduled to commence in
1968 at a rate of 200,000 tons per
annum, rising to 500,000 tons by 1970.
The cause of this interest in salt is
due to the rapid growth of the chemical
industry, both in Japan and other coun-
tries as well as in Australia. Apart from
the development being undertaken by
Norseman and Sumitomo, other saline
deposits are being developed around
Australia and production plans have
all the proportions of a “boom” in
salt. These projects will mean an in-
crease in local production from the
650,000 tons each year currently pro-
duced to well over 2,000,000 tons per
annum by 1970 and more than six
million tons in later years.
Most of this increase is aimed at the
export market, but a large part is to
be used in the production of chemicals
locally, notably potash. This project
will consume perhaps one million tons
of salt per annum in the production
of potash, and the company currently
studying its feasibility is Texada Mines
Limited of Canada. This company has
a lease over salt marshes north of Car-
narvon, Western Australia.
Other projects being developed in-
clude that being undertaken by the
Leslie Salt Company of San Francisco
near Port Hedland, W.A. This opera-
tion is to produce 475,000 tons per year
in 1969, rising to 2,000,000 tons, and
is expected to cost perhaps $8,000,000.
Production will be exported to Japan
under a contract with Toshaku Limited.
Other foreign companies are also
seeking brine-bearing areas, but local
companies are also sharing in the “salt
rush.” Shark Bay Salt Pty. Ltd., a
company owned by Adelaide Steamship
Company Ltd. together with Garrick
Agnew Pty. Ltd. (the Western Austra-
lian iron ore entrepreneur), is to start
production of salt this month from
areas in the Shark Bay district of West-
ern Australia. This project was due to
start a couple of years ago but found it
necessary to line the crystallising ponds
with polythene sheeting to prevent loss
of brine. This preparation took almost
a year to finish and increased capital
costs considerably. Production from this
company is to meet a contract for the
supply of 1,600,000 tons over seven
years to the Mitsui organisation of
Japan.
As is to be expected, Conzinc Riotinto
of Australia also has an interest in this
fast-growing section of the Australian
mineral industry. Its 50 percent owned
Comalco Industries Pty. Ltd. has areas
near Roebourne, in Western Australia,
which are capable of very large pro-
duction. Comalco is to develop the area
in conjunction with the Japanese com-
panies Marubeni-lida and Nissho, who
will have a one-third interest between
them, with Comalco having a two-
third interest in the venture, which is
believed to be aimed at an annual
production of up to 350,000 tons by
1970, rising to 1,500,000 tons per
annum in later years. This project
could cost up to $10,000,000, but has
the advantage of being close to Hamer-
sley Iron’s deepwater port at Dampier
Thiess Holdings, too, has not been
slow to investigate the possibilities of
salt extraction; it has temporary re-
serves covering areas in the Kimber-
leys, where it is also prospecting de-
posits of coal. BHP has long been a
producer of salt at Whyalla, where it
produced 85,000 tons in 1965, an in-
crease of 70 percent over the 1964
output of 50,000 tons, while ICIANZ
has for many years been the major
local producer of salt from its salt-
fields at Dry Creek, South Australia,
where production amounted to 347,000
tons in 1965.
ICIANZ agreed in May last year to
develop underground brine deposits
near Rockhampton, in Queensland, held
by Central Queensland Salt Industries
Ltd. This company has been producing
salt in Queensland for the past ten
years, unfortunately without outstand-
ing success due to the relatively low
scale of the operation and poor weather
conditions although small dividends
have been paid in the past five years.
The venture with ICIANZ should
prove of considerable benefit to the
company, as it will ensure the sale
of the salt produced, which has a much
higher salinity than the Western Aus-
tralian salt. The operation should be
producing 150,000 tons per annum in
eighteen months’ time, with potential
expansion to 500,000 tons per annum.
Output will be shipped to Sydney for
the caustic soda-chlorine plant at
ICIANZ’s Botany site.
Exports of salt in the past few years
have been worth between $5 to a
ton, but the prices for the salt supplied
under long-term contracts in future
years are no doubt much less than this
—perhaps $3 to $4 a ton would be a
realistic figure. Nevertheless, treatment
and extraction costs are sufficiently low
to make a fairly large-scale operation
reasonably attractive.
Commodities
Holding the line
for zinc
THE RIOTINTO GROUP, which
led zinc producers into abandoning
London Metal Exchange pricing during
the market boom three years ago, is
now leading attempts to stop prices
falling to uneconomic levels. The pr°"
ducer price was established at
a ton on July 13, 1964, when the LME
market was £132 and on the way to
£l5O. Within two months the P ro "
ducer quote was cut to £llO, as some

■
miners were persuaded of the value of
the scheme. The next reduction was
in March last year (to £lO2 a ton) and
last week another £4 was sliced off the
top.
RTZ, through Imperial Smelting
Corp., was the prime mover behind the
shift from pricing based on the unstable
LME market. The company reasoned
that long-term growth of consumption
at reasonable prices was more desirable
than short-term profits and dissatisfied
customers.
But last year’s cut to £lO2 was
generally regarded as the last that pro-
ducers would willingly make. By pur-
chasing metal on the LME and by
cutting production 10 percent, the lead-
ing smelters and miners had hoped to
hold the line.
Now ISC evidently plans to bring
the production cut to 15 percent. The
temptation to take advantage of the
majors’ self-denial may, however, prove
too much for some of their weaker
brethren in the industry. But evidently
ISC is so far satisfied by the co-opera-
tion among producers. (Local EZ Indus-
tries agreed in November to follow the
10 percent cut “soon.”)
Certainly, world supplies of zinc are
still more than adequate despite seven
or eight months of widening production
cuts. The latest £4 a ton cut in the
price of “good ordinary brand” metal
is in line with the discounts generally
being offered on premium-grade metal,
reported here last week.
In fact, despite their buying oper-
ations on the LME, prices there are
still below the producers’ new quote.
A lot now depends on whether other
smelters follow ISC’s latest lead in
cutting output.
The combined price of lead and zinc
£lBO or £9O a ton average is
now somewhat below the level that the
bigger producers would regard as satis-
factory. And on current estimates of
future demand, both lead and zinc have
yet to pan the worst.
THE SUGAR MARKET, still nervous
after last year’s unhappy experience,
was thrown into a panic last week by
news of a 70,000-ton sale by Argentina.
London prices were soon £lO a ton
below the short-lived peak at £32 set
during the Middle East crisis.
The fact that 30,000 or 40,000 tons
of Argentine sugar was in the hands
of a dealer (the rest went to a U.K.
refiner at about £23J) promoted the
weakness. Last year’s £l2 a ton trough
was the result mainly of another rela-
tively small parcel of raw sugar in the
hands of a merchant.
However, the market will likely prove
nrore resilient this time, and is un-
likely to move below £2O for long. Still,
the main chance for economic free-
warket sugar prices lies with a new
international production pact, but
although new moves are afoot for a
conference Cuban intransigence appears
to have been only slightly weakened by
economic hardship.

No wonder he’s the family favourite. Clean warm
air circulating in every room throughout the
coldest periods of the year. No huddling around
ineffective one-room heaters!
No frigid early morning toes! Instead, the won-
derful feeling of being able to wear summertime
clothes throughout your home every day of the
year—and with simple, finger-tip control!
Low fuel costs, too, and all fully automatic,
even the economical oil burner —that's what
Gilbarco Central “Whole House” Heating means
in the successful man’s home. You can get all
this for little more than the cost of heating
two or three rooms with “huddle-over” heating!
Two systems from which to choose: The popular
Hot Water Central Heating system incorporating

THE LAND
Miss Jones battles against
the egg board
MOST OF THE world’s egg-selling
promotions use the female image in
some way or another. (See Britain’s
1966 idea, using “chicks” with three-
toed plastic boots.) Victoria currently
has a campaign based on a “little Miss
Jones” (further based on Mrs. Jones
of margarine fame). But the object of
the promotion is not so much to sell
eggs as to carry the day for free-
traders in revolt against the Victorian
Egg Board and its stamped eggs.
It is not the first time that a promo-
tion idea has been borrowed, and little
Miss Jones (in real life a Miss Norma
Rutzou, daughter of a promotions man,
and no connection with Marrickville’s
Mrs. Jones) is unquestionably a
charmer.
But while her image is certain to
make an impact in the supermarkets,
the free-traders can hardly expect the
chubby two-year-old to make personal
appearances: she is too young, of
course, but apart from this, apparently
she is liable to change her mind about
eggs, stamped or unstamped.
When the publicity shots were being
taken she refused, at first, to eat the
egg in front of her. In desperation it
was suggested, so the story was told to
us, that an egg-shell be filled with
chocolate. Finally she decided to dip
her spoon in the egg and they got their
picture.
The free-traders, in Victoria, have
their tails up and are confident they
can penetrate into N.S.W. and South
Australia. Outlets selling unstamped
eggs have grown from about 600 to
1200 in the past two months in Mel-
bourne.
The argument that unstamped eggs
are fresher has been taken up on morn-
ing radio, to which thousands of house-
wives listen avidly. They also have
the time to wait their turn on the
phone for a chat with Barry Jones,
Norman Banks, Orione or the other
soothsayers, who have pushed rock-
n’-roll off the air.
Surprisingly, officialdom must listen
also. Egg Board spokesmen have got
on the “hot line” along with the house-
wives and have gone to great lengths
to refute the claims that unstamped
e ggs are fresher.
Barry Jones gave his listeners a long
description of how he toured the Egg
Board facilities and came away con-
vinced that the stamped eggs were
good value. But then, Jones is a Labor
man and Labor’s policy is to support
“orderly Board marketing.” Norman
Banks, so far, seems to be unconvinced
either way.
The issue, understandably, has be-
come clouded. The free-traders really
do not want abolition of the Egg
Board but its reconstitution. The
Board should fix prices and promote
eggs. It should net be a marketer of
eggs.
The free-traders say that Board
overhead has resulted in eggs being
ten cents a dozen dearer than they
should be. This, regardless of what you
may think of the Miss Jones gimmick,
is a powerful argument.
More powerful still has been the dis-
closure of a quite incredible situation
in Queensland.
The Central Egg Marketing
Authority’s plan, which started this
whole thing going, was brought in as
a Commonwealth measure. At the time
we said it would not work, and we
think we have been proved correct.
Apparently poultry farmers in North
Queensland did not like the CEMA
idea (nor did many poultry farmers
elsewhere). However, with no reference
whatsoever to the industry, the North
Queensland farmers were granted
total exemption from the CEMA hen
levy. The exemption was granted by
the Queensland Government, following
consultation with the Commonwealth.
In this case the Commonwealth would
have been the Primary Industries De-
partment. The free-traders say they
have been unable to get any satisfact-
ory explanation for the exemption and
assert it was a simple political expedi-
ent. Fair for one, fair for all, is the
free-traders’ view. Better to scrap the
CEMA device. At no time was the
majority of farmers, in any State, con-
sulted. The majority, they claim, of
genuine poultry farmers has always
been opposed to it.
The lack of logic in a decision to
grant any regional exemption was borne
out when Tasmanian farmers, for a
time, stopped paying the hen levy also.
They reasoned that they, too, were a
special case. Tasmania always has
marketing problems, and recently they
have had fires and drought.
But the Tasmanians apparently have
not the same influence in Canberra be-
cause they eventually had to start pay-
ing their levies again.
Now, following a successful court
British “chicks" at a briefing
action at Werribee, a number of Vic-
torian farmers have stopped paying
their levies. A Werribee court ruled
against the Egg Board on the ground
that it was not properly empowered to
collect a Federal levy. The Egg Board
has said it will challenge this decision
in the High Court. This sort of thing
could go on for a long, long time.
If little Miss Jones could understand
even half of it she would probably
throw her egg at the wall instead of
eating it.
Agrisearch
There are not
enough vets
PROFESSOR J. FRANCIS, Veterinary
School, University of Queensland, re-
grets the divorcement in latter days in
Australia between veterinary science
and human medicine. He attributes
much that is wrong to this. Mr. J. H.
Arundel, Veterinary School, University
of Melbourne, agrees. He says it is
disgraceful that there is no veterinary
surgeon on the staff of the Victorian
Department of Health. Both point out
that because of an acute shortage of
vets, and because city practice is more
rewarding, Australian agriculture and
the great pastoral industries, in particu-
lar, are inadequately provided with vet-
erinary help. These reflections on the
current state of the profession may be
gleaned from the pages of this month’s
“Australian Veterinary Journal.”
Mr. Arundel draws attention to a dis-
turbing situation: half of our veterinary
practitioners are almost solely con-
cerned with dogs, cats, and dairy cows.
And the dairy industry is probably des-
tined to shrink. The remnant will tend
to be even more disproportionately

over-supplied with vets than the in-
dustry is at present. He argues, then,
that realignment of interest and effort
in the profession is now highly desir-
able. The veterinary needs of Victoria’s
35 million sheep are left almost en-
tirely in the hands of a few specialists
employed by the Department of Agri-
culture. The burgeoning poultry in-
dustry is equally bereft of veterinary
assistance, despite its notorious pro-
pensity to sudden devastation through
disease. i
A comparable situation prevails
right across the country, although a
pastoral veterinary centre has been set
up in the Gunn territory at Goondi-
windi, Queensland. Wool Board money
got this show started, and clinical train-
ing and research are now conducted
there.
On the other hand, Professor Francis
warns that the desired changes may
not come about. He reminds us that
professional people, after all, are moti-
vated by the same basic influences that
activate the farmers and graziers them-
selves a pleasant and profitable life.
It would appear, then, that the live-
stock producers must face the fact
that they are competing with the owners
of pets in the cities for veterinary know-
ledge and skill. They might perhaps
bear this in mind when called upon to
finance veterinary training and research.
Another implication that might be
drawn from Professor Francis’ remarks
is that, compared with the arduous-
ness, isolation, and profits of private
practice in a pastoral area, a career in
veterinary research conducted in an
urban environment offers the prospect
of a much more congenial life. Hence
it would seem that the more money
the livestock farmers put up for research
the fewer will be the number of veter-
inarians available for them to consult
directly and to carry out the more
routine diagnoses and services.
Indeed, the hope of providing farm-
ers and graziers with satisfactory local
veterinary facilities may be even more
remote than ever. Our veterinary
science schools are not turning out
very many more vets now than they
were a decade ago. Meanwhile, in con-
trast, the schools of agriculture, medi-
cine, and science have grown several-
fold. Why our young people have not
been attracted to veterinary careers is
not obvious. The average earnings of
veterinary graduates are a good deal
higher than those of agricultural scien-
tists, for instance, and their choice of
employer is wider. This disinclination
to study veterinary medicine seems to
be world-wide, however. Professor Cun-
ningham earlier this year reported that
the world was increasing its number of
veterinarians by only two percent per
year. At this rate the rising demand
for vets will never be met.
The comparative lack of veterinary
influence in this country may partly
explain why proposed changes in the
quarantine regulations were repealed
lately. When the risks of introducing
human ailments and disastrous animal
diseases in unpasteurised cheese were
appreciated, means of shutting this door
were drafted. However, the overseas
manufacturers and local importers im-
mediately indicated certain practical
difficulties in complying with the pro-
posals, which were then dropped. The
National Health and Medical Research
Council was the body advising the
Commonwealth Minister for Health on
this matter.
Besides moving more strongly into
the public health field and the wool
and meat areas, Mr. Arundel suggests
that veterinarians should take over the
production and supervision of labora-
tory animals. Agricultural and medical
research consumes a vast number and
variety of experimental animals these
days. (Ironically, the sheep, one of the
animals with which vets are least
familiar, is now used more commonly
than dogs in experimental medicine.)
Students of zoology, physiology, and
pharmacology account for many more.
Veterinary surgeons on the staff of
institutions where such activities are
pursued would not only be able to
lift the standard of husbandry of the
animals but also see that they were
treated more humanely during vivi-
section.
Mr. Arundel’s last suggestion, practi-
cal and timely though it may be, never-
theless seems to contain a hint that the
profession has fallen into a slough of
frustration, paralysis, and bitterness.
Until recent times medical science more
often than not followed the footsteps
of the vets. Wasn’t it a Viennese veter-
inary surgeon who introduced the
hypodermic needle? And weren’t Kil-
bourne, Curtice, and Smith vets? From
their studies on cattle tick they showed
that insects could transmit disease and
it was this realisation that led Dr.
Reed to the conquest of yellow fever
at Panama in 1886. Dicumarol, now
widely used in medicine to relieve heart
and vascular disease, was discovered by
Schofield while studying clover disease
in cattle. Resperine, the tranquilliser,
was another veterinary finding. The use
of metal pins to repair bone fractures
was pioneered by veterinary surgeons.
That the vets should have let them-
selves be squeezed out of the public
health services in this country is as
incomprehensible as it is.absurd. They
had more than 4000 years of tradition
behind them in this vital field. Did
not the code of Hammurabi, compiled
about 2200 8.C., rely on vets to org-
anise the handling of meat? As soon
as the Jews got settled down in Pales-
tine for the first time they appointed
vets to carry out meat inspection and
supervise various other sanitary regula-
tions. So it has always been in eveiy
civilised country. The U.S. Public
Health Service today, for instance, has
130 vets on its staff.

A Lifetime in Fashion
One of a series, "Living is an Art," by SHEELAH WOOD
Madame Charles Fels talks to Sheelah Wood in the drawing-room. The painting
is by Marie Laurencin, the chest is Louis Quinze. On the floor is a Chinese silk
rug over 300 years old, woven with gold thread
THE PRINCIPAL of the Sydney
fashion house of Germaine Rocher,
Madame Fels, is a small, dark, vivacious
woman of great personal charm. She
was born in Russia and was sent by
her parents, when she was ten years
old, to live with an older brother in
Shanghai; she never saw her parents
again. She attended school in Shanghai,
where they spoke both French and
Russian, so that today she is completely
at home in three languages.
It was here, as a young girl, that
she met her Polish-born husband, the
late Charles Fels. Before World War
I he came to Australia on a business
trip. At the outbreak of war he enlisted
with the first AIF, saw service in Gal-
lipoli, and to the end of his life was
tremendously proud of his association
with this period of history and the
friendships he formed because of it.
He returned to England and then
went to China as a representative of a
French firm, and finally started an
antique business there, exporting to
France. After their marriage, the Fels
returned to France and reversed the
usual procedure by importing antiques
from China. They lived in Paris for
ten years, and it was there that Vera
Fels became interested in haute couture.
Americans were their best customers
in the antique business until the Depres-
sion of the ’thirties; then things began
to be difficult.
The Fels made a brave and romantic
decision to migrate to Australia and
start a dress business in Sydney. It was
a return to an old love for Charles, but
a leap into the unknown for his young
wife. With them they brought two
designers and dressmakers. They showed
their first collection in the old Carlton
Hotel in Sydney and then became the
first tenants in the building the firm
still occupies.
Charles Fels was the financial brain
and Vera’s the creative. But after his
death, she proved that she was capable
of managing both sides. Nevertheless,
she realises the tremendous effort this
has been to her and says it would not
have been possible without the staunch
support of her staff, many of whom
have been with her since the beginning
of the business.
Madame Fels goes to Europe every
year, and sometimes twice a year, to
buy for her collections. She employs
over 100 people of all nationalities in
her workrooms.
She says that her life is absorbing
and she loves it. She finds Australia
today exciting and a challenge in which
she is pleased to find herself taking
part.
Vera Fels says that fashion in this
country is different from that in Europe
in the sense that here, surprisingly,
women dress more carefully, and gener-
ally there is an all-round attention to
detail that does not exist for the average
European woman.
She emphasises that this excepts the
enormously rich people of whom we
have no equivalent here. She says there
is more entertaining in the home here
and people dress for it. In France, for
instance, the dressing is very casual
except for first nights at the opera,
theatre, and the great balls, when you

Fels ’ “library corned"
will see magnificent jewellery and furs
of a luxury we could not afford.
For herself, she has a good life here
and doubts if she will ever return to
Europe, though she talks of doing so.
But this has become more of a habit
with her and, in her heart, she is con-
tented and has made good friends.
Madame Fels says, “This quality among
Australian women, the capacity of
friendship with other women, is almost
unknown in Europe, and I have be-
come accustomed to it.”
However, she admits that she has
the best of both worlds with her yearly
tnps of three to four months overseas
and her beautiful house and her friends
to return to each time.
Madame Fels runs her house with a
iive-in housekeeper who has been with
her for 15 years. The other occupant
and star centre of the house is her
beloved grey poodle. Vera adores enter-
taining and does a great deal for visi-
tors from overseas. She gives a lot of
small cocktail parties, but prefers din-
ars and weekend luncheons on her
terrace.

“HIS FACE WAS quizzical. She had
seen the expression so often, when he
was puzzling over a difficult Press-
conference question. Now', in a gesture
of infinite grace, he raised his right
hand, as though to brush back his
tousled chestnut hair. But the motion
faltered. The hand fell back limply.
He had been reaching for the top of
his head. But it wasn’t there any more.”
William Manchester's “The Death of
a President” is now on sale in Austra-
lia and one can confirm the suspicion
that it would prove worse than the
serialised newspaper extracts made it
appear. Most of it is bulked out with
ballast, fact piled on fact piled on fact
(as if all facts were equal, in the “New
Yorker” belief), although written with
the tawdriness of a hastily dictated
afternoon newspaper story. Even the
passages in it that do have significance
are badly done. Presumably the moment
of President Kennedy’s assassination is
of some particular importance in the
book, yet even here Mr. Manchester
tries to get by with “a gesture of infin-
ite grace” and a head that isn’t there.
It is hard to remember that the central
character was real and that he was
killed.
The book treats facts in the method
of simultaneous narrative worked out
in modern fiction’s “experimental”
period: get some characters, describe
what each of them is doing at a [jar-
ticular time, and flash from one to the
other. When in doubt use italics. Most
attempts to use fictional methods in
dealing with facts fail. The novelist in
his sensitivity and his compassion is
creating worlds which he can manipu-
late into his images or reality. The his-
torian, or whatever it is that Mr. Man-
chester is, must start by paying some
attention to what the particular facts
are and then consider how they “mat-
ter.” If he has any artistry, he employs
it in bringing out the nature of what
happened in some particular case. To
impose a novelist’s forms on to facts is
either to distort or to bore with the
meaningless.
Pierre Salinger’s “With Kennedy,”
now also available in Australia, is so
fictionalised in treatment that I didn’t
bother to finish it. I suppose there are
people who read non-fiction that is gen-
erously made up of dialogue just
like novels and can delude them-
selves into believing that all this is just
as the man said it, but the improba-
bility of this being so was with me ori
every page. When this phoniness is
accompanied by an amazing deadness of
style, why read on? . . . “life in the
White House had its high and low
moments” . . . “the whole thing was a
valuable lesson” ... “I must say frankly
that I liked it.” Do people really read
their way through a book made up of
dead sentences interlarded with un-
likely dialogue?

Arthur Schlesinger’s “A Thousand
Days” is a reminder that at least one
of those who got on the bandwagon
is actually able to write. Schlesinger
uses the traditional methods of hand-
ling facts. He gives some idea of what
he knows, and what other people know,
and what he guesses; he searches for
significance, exploring themes rather
than just typing out his notes; and
he does it with a sense of style so
that you get an idea of how Schlesinger
sees political life generally. He also
reveals the fastidious historian’s talent
Malinger. .. unreadable
Manchester... tawdry
Schlesinger ... stylish
for not only putting up his own
interpretation but also providing facts
from which one might make a different
interpretation.
And through it all run some of the
themes of politics: the modesty of the
role that great men can have in shap-
ing events, impelled as they are by
ignorance and accident; the manliness
of attempting the task, knowing its dan-
gers; the talent for riding chaos and
giving it apparent meaning; the zest
for great affairs and for their excite-
ment and irony. It was not Kennedy’s
short sentences or his coiffure but his
combination of detachment and involve-
ment, the pessimism of his historical
sense combined with the optimism of
his desire to do something, that forged
“the Kennedy style.”
It is lamentable that so stylish and
so tough a political leader should have
had so many expensive plastic blooms
and wilted blossoms laid as tribute on
his grave by the publishing business;
but excellent that in Schlesinger at least
his memory has found those garden
flowers, cut fresh, from a friend, which
alone provide a true metaphor of grief
among the flowers at funerals.
Less than best

Best Stories of the South Seas. Edited
by Philip Snow. Faber. $2.65.
HAD THIS BOOK been called “My
Favorite South Seas Stories” or some-
thing like that there could have been
little quarrel with it. But as the title
stands not all Philip Snow’s introduct-
ory assertions about writers who are
omitted, or his explanation that this
is “a very personal selection,” absolve
him of blame.
Snow contends that many nineteenth-
century candidates for inclusion are
“dated and faded.” He rejects Louis
Becke as being too “ebullient” and says
“he was about as introspective as his
great friend in life, ‘Bully’ Hayes.
He blackballs himself, and so did the
American Jack London ... for a rum-
bustiousness, a lack of sensitivity, that
is jarring to the modern ear.”
One can only applaud Snow’s prefer-
ence for authenticity the majority
of pieces included are chapters from
books and some of the tales told are
rare and strange indeed Will Mar-
riner in Tonga; the heartless fraud of
Charles I, self-styled “Emperor of
Oceania”; Snow’s own Pitcairn impos-
tor, who was unmasked by an extra-
ordinary coincidence.
Only one story, John W. Vander-


cook’s “Dark Islands” (which has a
Papuan setting) attempts any explana-
tion of present-day problems of either
native or white people. It is the poor-
est story in the book and, when I think
of some of the choices available in
present-day Australian and New Zea-
land writing, I can only wish that
Snow, who has had first-hand admini-
strative experience in some of the
island groups, had done a little more
recent homework.
Indeed the collection is rich in the
adventures, speculations, hardships, and
tragedies of white people, but inexcus-
ably silent about the dreadful exploita-
tion of Pacific island peoples and natu-
ral resources. One respects the “per-
sonal selection” of the editor, but re-
grets not only the ebullient Becke, the
wily Maugham, and the romantic Loti
but also a brace of French, German,
and present-day authors Margaret
Mead, David Selby, and Olaf Ruhen,
to name only three.
Islands satire
By OLAF RUHEN
Serpents in Paradise. Nancy Phelan.
Macmillan. $3.15.
EXPERTS ARE obvious targets for the
satirist: experts and do-gooders, and the
people who know (better than you)
what’s good for you. They are fair
game and there are plenty of recent
books, some amusing, some a little
frightening, some even hilarious, to
testify to the excellence of the sport of
gunning for them.
The local wonder is that so few
satirists have hunted in the bosky
thickets of the South Pacific, where the
expert has replaced the missionary,
ignored the trader, and harassed any
government official who could not lay
claim himself to the title. The whole
area is sparkling with gleams from
expert eyes who see in its vast lassi-
tudes, traditionally undisturbed, an
ocean for the launching of any theory
remotely concerned with the human and
his “betterment.”
Experts have been given additional
scope by the mid-century proliferation
of charitable foundations and semi-
public institutions which vie with
assorted governments in providing
grants for the pursuit of a wide range
of inquiries. Lay researchers compete
with the university crowd; there is, for
example, such a stream of young
American anthropologists that there is
difficulty, these days, in locating a
village to observe.
Nancy Phelan, something more than
an occasional wanderer in these waters,
strikes hard at the experts in “Serpents
in Paradise,” and obviously she knows
them well, from the linguist in pursuit
Olaf Ruhen... one of the three
of glottal stops to the nomad advocate
of breast-feeding. She has produced a
delightful comedy, the more enjoyable
because of its validity. It is unambitious
but well placed. She was wise, I think,
to invent an island group called the
Peaceful Islands; the Caucasian popu-
lation of any of the groups is very
small, and all the idiosyncrasies of all
the permanent residents widely known.
The Peaceful Islands, as Miss Phelan
presents them, bear strong resemblances
to the Cook group; the Cook dialect, I
note, has influenced her choice of names;
but fair’s fair; her islands may remain
anonymous. Still, aspects of them pre-
sent a lifelike appearance.
When I first encountered them I was
disappointed in Miss Phelan’s Maoris;
they are like no human beings in my
experience except for a pair of land-
ladies in Brighton, England. Then I
realised that they are, of course, the
Maoris of the Experts. A preconceived
task (such as Experts envisage in college
days) demands preconceived objects.
Natives as they exist don’t fit into the
category of subjects the Expert needs
for his ministrations. He needs amor-
ality, bad teeth, squalor, dirt, and uncol-
lected garbage, laziness, stupidity. He
invents them to the end that his theories
will operate. Miss Phelan has simply
seen to it that her experts have some-
thing to try their calipers on.
Successful failure
By NANCY KEESING
Henry Handel Richardson. Leonie
Kramer. Oxford University Press.
55c.
NO ONE FAMILIAR with Professor
Kramer’s work in literary criticism will
be surprised to find this monograph in
the “Great Australians” series lucid
and thorough. Henry Handel Richard-
son drew heavily on her own and her
family’s history for her best novels.
Therefore, to fully enjoy and under-
stand her books, a knowledge of her
background is far more necessary than
is the case with many other novelists
In this booklet all the important f act '
are presented with a clarity and flow
that tend to mask the skill with which
critical judgments and assessments are
interwoven.
Richardson was a writer so nervous
of physical publicity or of private i n .
trusion into her world that she lived
in a seclusive retirement which seems
chilling, almost repellent. Maids j n
her soundless house padded in felt slin.
pers up thickly carpeted staircases while
their mistress worked in an ivory-tower
study behind a “muffled” baize door
She was supported and encouraged in
her work by an intelligent, devoted
and surely selfless husband.
Professor Kramer suggests that Rich-
ardson’s achievement “was not of the
very highest order. She was skilled in
reconstruction rather than in creation.”
Professor Kramer also stresses two
essential paradoxes: first, that after
1903 Richardson was so cut off from
direct life that she eventually cut her-
self off from the source of her material
life itself; secondly, that being so
much preoccupied both personally and
as a writer with failure “she turned
failure into success.”
Novellas
By MARGARET IRVIN
The Presence Of Music. Maurice Shad*
bolt. Cassell. $3.50.
THESE THREE NOVELLAS by a
New Zealand writer are all concerned
with the potent influence of the past
and with journeys undertaken because
of this influence. Shadbolt’s talent is-
extraordinarily pictorial, and his char-
acters are always swayed by emotional
rather than cerebral decisions that lead
to bitter inner and outer conflicts.
Each of the novellas is narrated in
the first person, thereby achieving a
strong subjective intensity. In the first,
“The Voyagers,” the people are fairly
stock types. They represent the stable
and unstable, selfish and unselfish,
creative and uncreative, and, above all,
the plasticity and ruthlessness of youth.
The two main characters are brought
together in young manhood through a
vividly remembered childhood friend-
ship. In outlook, temperament, and
ambition they are totally opposed —one
an artist, the other a law student. Both
are in love with the same girl and have
to face the symbolic voyage to realise
their ambitions.
In the second novella, “The Presence
Of Music,” the past is more pervasive.
Shadbolt catches well the directionless
personality who drifts toward a destina-
tion instead of forcefully seeking one, as
does the hero, whose voyage takes hiffl
to a climax that is nearer catastrophe
than tragedy. But it does not quite move
one as it should. T
The third novella, “Figures l n
Light,” is a beautiful one, close to p el '


, t ; on —. lyrical, disturbing, and satis-
fy. Here, atmosphere blends with
delineation, and the characters are pre-
sented with the simplicity that reveals
complexities. The theme of the past is
just as strong, but the writing is both
subtle and translucent.
The story is about a triple relation-
a man, his wife, and his sister.
The past enters with the evocation of
the brother’s and sister’s childhood, and
with the presence of their dead father
on the periphery of their memories.
Memorable movies
By JOHN BAXTER
All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing!
John Springer. Citadel Press. $12.50.
THE MOVIE MUSICAL was a hot-
house flower. It bloomed briefly in the
first days of sound film, bursting out in
the garish hues of the old two-color
Technicolor to divert American
audiences from the miseries of the
Depression. In the early ’thirties, it lost
its color and found its voice. Musicals
became tough, witty, erotic; the dance
director, Busby Berkeley, and stars like
Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, and A 1 Jol-
son, gave Warner Brothers a corner
on the musical market that was not
seriously shaken until Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer entered the field at the end of
the war. The story of the musical is a
fascinating one, but John Springer’s
estimate is that of a fan enthusiastic,
shallow, and uncritical.
Springer, a famous collector of movie
stills and frequent contributor to the
bible of Hollywood movie buffs, the
magazine “Films In Review,” has given
us a history in the chauvinistic tradition
of modern American film research.
‘All Talking! All Singing! All Danc-
ing!” has only a few thousand words of
text, the balance being taken up by a
Al Joison. .. all-colorful
roughly chronological series of stills.
Some of them are new and interesting,
and there is a fair percentage of old
illustrations, here shown with a clarity
and sharpness that allows rediscovery.
The remainder, however, are the same
old tedious favorites.
He repeats tired estimates of the
pioneering Warners musicals of the
’thirties, refusing to see anything good
in them but Busby Berkeley’s dance
spectaculars and ignoring the effective
comedy playing and skilled direction
which gave the musical numbers a
background against which to shine. He
is similarly traditional with the musicals
of other countries.
The absence of any serious considera-
tion of musicals as films stems from
Springer’s refusal to see them as any-
thing but a series of songs. Devoted to
this concept, he gives us after each of
the early chapters, and later in a sort
of appendix, a haphazard list of all the
songs he has enjoyed in musicals. Songs
are no more the whole musical than
arias are the whole opera. One had
hoped Springer of all people would see
this and write his history accordingly.
Nothing new
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Schumann. Joan Chissell. Dent. $4.80.
The Gallic Muse. Laurence Davies.
Dent. $7.
FRINGE-BOOKS on music for do-it-
yourself musicologists are not read as
avidly as they once were, having been
largely superseded by the annotated
record sleeve. Both these books still
have at least one foot in the musical
dabbler’s happy hunting ground.
“Schumann” was first written for the
“Master Musicians” series 20 years ago,
and, although an introduction states that
this edition has been revised in places,
its overall examination of Schumann
and romanticism is still firmly rooted
in the 19th century.
“Schumann” is divided up into sec-
tions; the same . old factually written
account of his life; a section of his
activities as music critic when he estab-
lished the influential “Neue Zietschrift
fuer Musik” (“The New Journal for
Music”); and separate chapters for
musical analysis with many quotations.
Musically, it seems incredible that in
1967, analyses after the principles of
1910 can still be offered seriously, in-
stead of being re-examined on modern
terms.
Laurence Davies first states that his
aim in “The Gallic Muse” is to trace
“the development of French music
throughout the period in question,”
which he gives as 1865 to 1965, and
immediately proceeds to omit the two
great giants who were still alive in
1865, Berlioz and Bizet, but favors
Faure, Duparc (but not Roussel), De-
bussy, Satie, Ravel, and Poulenc (but
not Milhaud) with an essay each.
Even if Dr. Davies is against
“musicological fact-grubbing” and even
if he did not know of the new dis-
coveries in the volume on Ravel by
one of the world’s most progressive
writers, Professor H. H. Stucken-
schmidt, it is regrettable that he chooses
to remain so far in arrears. And even
when he has the right facts he seems
to put them invariably into the wrong
perspective.
Disappointments
By VIVIAN SMITH
High and Low. John Betjeman. John
Murray. 15/- sterling.
Silence in the Snowy Fields. Robert
Bly. Cape. $3.50.
The Solitaries. Ted Walker. Cape.
$3.05.
IT IS NO ACCIDENT that John
Betjeman’s poetry is so highly admired
by W. H. Auden and Philip Larkin,
both of whom have seen in it origin-
ality and idiosyncratic brilliance. Bet-
jeman is a delightful performer and he
is not a critical problem: he is, to put
it briefly and crudely, a deliberate Mc-
Gonagall; a poet fully conscious of
his own solemn absurdity and capable
of charging his sentimentality with
ironic overtones. Betjeman is not a gen-
teel poet (as “Narcissus” in the present
volume is sufficient to indicate); he has
an individual eye and a capacity for
responding to the surrounding scene,
which doubtless helps to explain, in
part at any rate, the exceptional popu-
larity of his “Collected Poems.”
“High and Low” is divided into four
characteristic sections: “Landscapes,’*
“Portraits,” “Personal” poems in the
vein of “Summoned by Bells” and
“Light and Dark,” perhaps the most
savagely personal of all. Betjeman
constantly moves between parody and
pastiche (even self-parody and self-
pastiche) and his characteristic tone is
curiously hard to illustrate. A few lines
from “A Russell Flint,” however, give
something of his qualities of absurd
intensity:
“I could see you in a Sussex teashop,
Dressed in peasant weave and
brogues,
Turning over, as firelight shone ou
brassware,
Last year’s tea-stained Vogues.”
The complete discrepancy here be-
tween content and form is at the heart
of Betjeman’s special and perhaps very
English brand of humor.
It has become something of a cliche
that contemporary American poetry
is superior to contemporary English
poetry. Certainly it is different con-
temporary English poetry has no Robert
Lowell but the younger American
poets who are being held up for our

admiration, Robert Creeley and Robert
Bly in particular, prove rather disap-
pointing when read in bulk.
Of the two, Robert Bly seems to me
the most interesting. He has a capacity
for isolating the thing in itself and
some of his stanzas have a Chinese
limpidity. But his poems, for all their
stylishness, lack resonance, as if the
self were nothing but externalities, and
their sense of human involvement is ex-
tremely limited.
Ted Walker’s “The Solitaries” is a
disappointment after his first book, “Fox
on a Barn Door,” which showed him
as a gentler Ted Hughes. What looked
like a gift for remarkable images finds
little development in his new collec-
tion, though his work has retained its
lilting cadence.
Some of Walker’s poems are now
almost Larkinesque in subject matter
and tone, especially “Homing Pigeons”
and, my favorite, “Mules,” with its
combination of minute particularity and
generality. Other poems touch on child-
hood memories, with details of his
family. But my general impression is
of a poet who is publishing too much.
Australian birds
By ALEC CHISHOLM
Birds of the Sun. Michael Sharland.
Angus and Robertson. $3.95.
THIS BOOK CARRIES a sprinkling
of material directed to the dedicated
bird-student and the text as a whole
is essentially entertaining and informa-
tive gossip, well within the general-
interest range. It presents, in fact, a
series of easy-going chatters that not
only illume many facets of the Austra-
lian earth and its attributes, but reveal
the warm pleasure that the author and
his mates have gained, from both bush-
birds and bushmen, during their sunlit
wanderings.
This point appears to have impressed
Sir Gerald Lathbury when Sharland, on
a shrewd impulse, deposited the narra-
tive in his martial lap and solicited a
foreword. Sir Gerald, now Governor of
Gibraltar, came to Australia two years
ago simply for the purpose of gazing at
birds in their natural settings and
within a few months he made quite
a host of the desired contacts.
Sharland’s story strongly emphasises
the appeal of Australia’s distinctive
birds and enters a hearty plea for con-
servation.
Basically, Sharland is Tasmanian
property. But he has roamed over much
of the mainland on the avian trail, and,
maybe because of his temperate-zone
origin, he reacts with special warmth
to the charm of birds of the sun, as
presented in particular by northern and
central Australia.


LETTERS
Why the war...
y[ & y I limit myself to the correction
0 f two major inaccuracies which, I
feel led to some erroneous conclusions
in your article “Why the War Hap-
pened” (8., June 17).
1, “ . . then, on May 16 . . . the
provoked Israelis deployed 14 Brigades
in offensive formation a few miles from
Syria’s borders.” This allegation was
conclusively proved to be one of the
many mendacious propaganda allega-
tions fabricated by Egypt; the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, in his
report to the Security Council (Docu-
ment S/7896 dated May 19), stated
unequivocally that the independent in-
quiries which he had conducted through
his own UN representatives in the
area confirmed the facts, as stated by
Israel, that no troop concentrations had
taken place on the Israel-Syrian bor-
der.
2. “Israel had not occupied the Port
of Eilat by agreement.” This, too, is
incorrect. Eilat was included in the
Jewish State by the General Assembly’s
resolution of 1947. Furthermore, Eilat
(then known as Umm Reshresh) was
covered by the Hashemite Jordan
Kingdom-Israel General Armistice
Agreement, signed at Rhodes on April
3, 1949; the map attached to this
agreement, which formed an integral
part of it, shows Eilat in Israel terri-
tory.

The Catholic crisis
May I, as a theologically uninformed
Catholic, voice my opinion concerning
Mr. Gough’s article (8., May 27)?
Apart from certain ludicrous
generalisations (such as the one about
two out of three Catholics ignoring
the traditional teaching of the Church
on birth control) much of what Mr.
Gough wrote is perfectly true. However,
I do suggest that he has fallen into the
ver y human error of taking an exclu-
de view of the present in attaching
undue significance to the crisis of which
he writes.
The Catholic Church is in a state of
cnsis - It is a marvellous thing for news-
papers that it is. One can imagine an
lssu e of The Bulletin somewhere about
l he time of the great debate (“Luther
bays it on the Line”). And the photo-
graphs would have been very graphic.
However, to return to the 20th cen-
Ur y to over-emphasise the situation is
0 take a blind look at history. The
church has been in a state of crisis
since Pentecost. Let’s not forget that
eleven of her twelve original priests
died violently. From the stoning of
Stephen to the crucifixion of Peter it
was one crisis after another. The atroci-
ties of Nero’s persecution defy descrip-
tion. And then there were the Mar-
cionites and Gnostics and various other
heretics and defectors whose names
elude my mind.
Divisions within the Church have
been with us since Peter’s dispute with
Paul. Somehow or other the Church
has survived. Today we read of intel-
lectual Catholics, enlightened Catho-
lics, the new theology, and priests who
prefer sex to saying Mass. In spite of
it all, I still prefer St. Thomas More
to Father Charles Davis.
IAN BARKER
Alice Springs (N.T.)
A friend gave me just now the May
27 issue of The Bulletin. The article
“Priests — the Catholic Crisis” is very
interesting and shows that Peter Gough
has a thorough understanding of the
Catholic Church in Australia and of
the new approach and the new atti-
tudes of the Vatican II Council. A
few statistics about seminarians in Vic-
toria may be incorrect, but his general
line seems to be true. However, his
conclusions seem a bit dark. I, as a
Catholic priest, feel much more hopeful
because of the new spirit of the Vati-
can Council, which is coming to Aus-
tralia and which has reached it, I
think, to a greater degree already than
this article indicates. More and more,
the Church is becoming the sign and
the sacrament of God’s love and salva-
tion to all men, whether they actually
belong to her or not. Nevertheless, I
wish to congratulate and to thank you
for this fine article by Peter Gough.
Fr. GUSTAV KRAMER
Narrabundah (A.C.T.)
I was disappointed, although not sur-
prised, to see the letters by fellow
Catholics condemning the article “The
Catholic Crisis” by Mr. Peter Gough.
I considered the article stimulating and
not in the least offensive, but this must
be because I have “not even a moderate
understanding of the C a t h o li c
Church,” to quote Mr. O’Neill.
Clearly, my concept of what the
Church should be is in marked con-
trast to Mr. O’Neill’s. It seems to me
that if the Church is truly concerned
with her pastoral vocation, then she
will always be in turmoil as she con-
tinues to reassess her understanding of
the truths she teaches in the light of
the changing needs and environment
of her people. This process of constant
reassessment and search for deeper
understanding may be a very uncom-
fortable one for her members, as even
the most complacent are forced them-
selves to take part, being unable, for
example, to ignore recent liturgical
changes. But, uncomfortable though it
may be, it is essential.
I welcome, therefore, signs that cer-
tain clergymen are re-examining present
concepts toward their vocation as
evidence that the Church is vigorously
alive. I may be misunderstanding Mr.
O’Neill, but it seems to me that he
would prefer to retire into the stable
(or stagnant?) little world of Aus-
tralian Catholics of 15 years ago, whose
catchcry was, “The church cannot
change.” Otherwise, why should he be
distressed by criticisms of present
policies?
It seems to me that it is a fact that
some of Mr. Gough’s statements are
truer of the Church overseas than in
Australia, but then this for me is a
source of shame rather than consola-
tion, evidence of greater con-
servatism of the Australian Church.

It was kind of Daphne Guinness in her
account of the “Engine Art Exhibition”
to leave out the frightful things I had
said to her. (She was cloaking herself
in the respectable company of a mutual
friend and looked much too pretty for
a newspaper writer.)
I am glad she got the point that
large works of art these days are mostly
intended for small rooms. But she
didn’t register a distinction I made be-
tween an artist whose work I might
like best and one whose work was best.
The event which we both attended
was too exciting for final judgments on
works of art. I returned later for these.

Sex appeal
Peter Samuel’s article on Gough Whit-
lam (8., June 3) lacks objectivity and
consistency. He admits that among Mr.
Whitlam’s interests are “an imagina-
tive adaptation to automation,” but in
the next accuses him of “humdrum
policies.” Interstellar research would be
humdrum to some. And who told him
Mr. Whitlam has no sex appeal?
