AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and fim?
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
£1700 Story Competition
The Bulletin wants the Australian novel
to take the place of the American and
English productions which now flood the
bookshops. A school of short-story writers
has been built up in Australia through this
paper’s efforts during more than 45 years
past. Now The Bulletin is going to see
whether a school of- novelists cannot also
be built up. To this end it offers a mini-
mum of £l7OO in prizes for novels during
the next three years. The first competition
will close on June 30, 1928. For this the
prizes will be: First, £500; 2nd, £125; 3rd,
£75. All persons Australian-born are
eligible; also ail persons bona fide resident
in Australia, Maoriland or the South
Pacific Islands.
The stories are to be available for
serial publication in The Bulletin and
the Woman’s Mikkok. Otherwise, copy-
right will belong wholly to the writer; all
picture -rights will likewise remain his pro-
perty.
Jessie Mackay
Her name is a modest one but full of
meaning, penetrated with Scottish history.
Her birthplace is Maoriland, in that
southern part where Scots have often found
homes for their descendants. Born within
sound and sight of rivers and waterfalls
streaming from snowy heights, Jessie Mac-
kay has been able to fill her poems with
that influence:—
Pure, oh pure !
Prodigal, primal founts
That sang my cradle-rliyme.
It is hard to name a poet who has been
truer to one district and personal inspira-
tion. Nearly every line of hers is, as they
say, signed. She has a recognisable sweet-
ness and austerity: within such limits she
moves, and there is grace in her move-
ments.
It is probable that her best-known book,
“Land of the Morning,” published about
1909. is so long out of print that many
among us, who ought to know it, have never
even seen it. It is time for -a new edition
of that book; or, better, for a large volume
collecting all Jessie Mackay’s best work up
till now. When I heard there was a new
book of her verse out lately I hoped it
might be her “Works,” but it proved to bo
something slighter, with immediate and per-
sonal charm, but not what we are await-
ing. While reading it, though, I found its
idiom and freshness drawing me back to
the older book —in memory only, since
"Land of the Morning” is one of those
books that are constantly lent and by going
often to the well are finally drowned in
it.
In memory, then, “Land of the Morn-
ing” stands out as the work of one who
found the Celtic ford that “spans the
ocean.” The public and occasional poems
were all more or less tinged with Scot-
tish glamor which gave them that group-
sense familiar to Highland music. For
instance, her lament for John Mackenzie
is like a pibroch, beginning
They played him home to his house of stones,
and with each of the rolling stanzas ending
And the clan went sorrowing all the way.
The poem is full of traditions in form and
character, and yet utters a simple lament
for one who was a pioneer in a new land.
Jessie Mackay is one of the few poets who
can utter shared and public emotions with-
out making them, into dull rhetoric. In
the new, small book, “Bride of the Waters,”
there are several poems of this kind, in-
cluding “The Song of the Bridge,” which
celebrates the opening of a memorial bridge
at Christchurch. The men who left for the
war had all passed across the old bridge,
and now
They are the bridge, our own, our own!—
Built to a spirit chime
Over the water that wept and flowed
Dark and soft as time.
Over the bridge of gift they made
A-many feet shall go.. . .
Into the white and warless world
They dared and died to win.
Such words of faith bring the heartache of
dread with them, but it cannot be gainsaid
that they were the utterance of a shared
emotion at its highest.
Looking back again, what everyone re-
members of “Land of the Morning” most
easily and with most delight are the sheer
lyrics, each one shapely and complete. Per-
haps Jessie Mackay is tired of being told
that she wrote “I Came to Your Town,”
but it is a tiredness that others could
endure. Here is one of the three stanzas
which make its exquisite trefoil: —
I came to your town, my love,
And you were away, away.
1 said,'She is with the mountain elves,
As misty and fair as they.
They are spinning a diamond net
To cover her curls of jet:
But oh, the pity.
I had but a noon of searing heat
To come to your town, my love, my .sweet,
And you were away, away.
Such a lyric is dependent on its original
and inevitable rhythm; but there were
others, more gravely meditative, carried for-
ward solely by the sway of their theme.
Such was that one in five stanzas, each
ene asserting that “she” had found her
heaven, wherever, whatever that might be:
If there he a Valhalla, she is there.
Her eyes beat down the hammer and the spear,
.'.lid Mother Freya’s hand is on her hair.
That second line is worth and surpasses a
thousand logical statements of pacifism. A
poet’s one excuse for writing in verse at all
is that the idea could not be expressed in
prose. In Jessie Mackay’s poetry the words
are indeed “raised to a higher power,” and
their overtones cany conviction.
Jessie Mack-ay has written poems of
places, Dunedin and wilder regions. She has
produced a body of poems expressing the
Maori legends, which ought to be collected
by themselves. It is enough to say that
her work is always genuine, with a robust
certainty about it.
Apart from her actual writing, her
interests are so wide that some .years ago*
she was bidden to the Irish Race Congress
in Europe. One record at least of her sym-
pathy is shown in the poem “The Keening,”
a lament for the tragic and almost simul-
taneous loss of Griffith and Collins, “Little
Arthur and Young Michael”:—
Art Beg and Michael Oge, Eire shall rise,
God’s peace upon her like dew from the skies.
Rest here was none for you: this did you
crave—
God's peace flowing from the altar of your
grave!
The poem has even at this time of writing
a fresh emphasis, through a new loss.
Jessie Mackay is a Maorilander, or,
as her most brilliant Australian champion
prefers it, an Austrazealander. Her poems,
though, have long since seemed part of our
Australian store, too, and our Mary Gilmore
has written a ringing poem with its refrain
on the name of Jessie Mackay.
NETTIE PALMER.
Sir Harry Johnston
A versatile genius—for lie was all that
—set out on his last safari when Sir Harry
Johnston died in England the other day at
69. Colonial administrator —for he was a
man of the Colonies and the Protectorates
throughput his career—explorer, naturalist,
zoologist, ethnologist, philologist, artist and,
finally, novelist, his was a many-faceted
life. Born in England of Scottish stock,
he Studied biology and its kindred sciences,
going thence to Paris to the art schools to
add to what he had learned at the Royal
Academy schools. Still later, the unrest
in his blood took him to Algeria and North-
ern Africa, where the magic of exploration
and strange peoples laid hold of him. In
the early 1880’s, Portuguese West Africa
and the Congo claimed him, and he did so
well there that the Royal Society offered
him the leadership of its expedition to
Mount Kilimanjaro. This gave him his
first sight of that Central Africa with which
his name will always be connected.
The Colonial Office, which he so scath-
ingly ridiculed in his latter-day novel, “The
Man Who Did the Right Thing,” naturally
sent Johnston to such places as Tunis and
Mozambique after his unique experiences
with the African natives of far-inland Ny-
assa and Tanganyika. Nevertheless, he was
brought back to Central Africa, and there,
as Special Commissioner for the Uganda
Protectorate, he laid down a foundation
which will remain his outstanding memorial.
In between all this he .found time to write
several works on Central Africa which are
still standard references on the subject. As
a naturalist, he has become immortalised
as the first authentic describer of that
strange giraffe-like dweller in the Congo
forests, the okapi. As an ethnologist and
philologist, his works on the Bantu dialects
of Central Africa are universally accepted
as the last authority. His work for zoology
cannot be crammed into a sentence, and
as an artist he illustrated many of his own
books of travel and research with produc-
tions remarkable for their vigor and sense
of color.
Johnston was a person of singular inde-
pendence of character, and this is reflected
in all his serious writings, and especially in
his autobiography. His opinion of the
Colonial Office and its officials has already
been referred to. There can be no doubt
this helped to cut short his brilliant career,
for it is impossible to avoid the inference
in the autobiography that the C.O. had
treated him badly—though Johnston did no
squealing, in this book or any of his others.
He was created a K.C.B. in 1896 and a
G.C.M.G. in 1901, and of the first honor
he tells a characteristically irreverent story.
Hustled into a small cabinet, through which
others to be honored had passed and were
to pass, he was told to kneel. The Duke
of Connaught, standing by, read out a
name, reasons for bestowal of the knight-
hood, etc., and the Queen-Empress tapped
him shakily with a Court sword. Johnston
was pushed out at the other door before
he found time to explain that the name
read out as his belonged to someone lie had
never heard of, and that the “services” were
alleged to have been rendered somewhere
in Northern India, wherein he had never
set foot.
But the most interesting phase of this
interesting man’s life was his entry into
novel writing in 1919. after lie had done
his bit in the Great War and was entering
on his 61st, year. Thackeray, who carried the
original characters of “Esmond” through
“The Virginians” and “Vanity Fair,” almost,
to the end of his long series, was probably
his example. In “The Gay Dombeys ”
Johnston carried on the Dickons story of
(Continued on page 5.)

“Dombev and Son” into the third and fourth
generation of its characters, and a very
satisfactory job he made oi it. “The
Veneerings,” which attempted the same
task with the little world of “Our Mutual
Friend,” was not so convincing, nor was
“Mrs. Warren’s Daughter,” a “follow-on” of
Bernard Shaw’s “Mrs. Warren’s Profession.”
Best of all, perhaps, is his “Little Life
Stories,” curiously vivid vignettes, mostly
of his own earlier London experience in
his biological days.
A pleasant personality, with a good eye
for publicity and a most catholic outlook
on life, Johnston must be ranked as a
Victorian worthy to go with Richard Bur-
ton. But though he did far more for
Britain than Burton did, it is unlikely that
he will ever attain the latter’s standing in
the halls of fame. He was Burton’s equal
in many things, and his superior in some,
but, Rabelaisian in outlook as he was, he
was utterly lacking in the great European-
Asiatio’s gift of porno.^aphy.

An Open Season for Booksellers
A bookseller is usually a well-protected
man, but for a week in September we are
all going to be allowed a pot-shot at him.
The week is called Australian Authors’
Week, and while it lasts we shall be able to
ask for any' Australian book we like and
the bookseller will have to look pleasant,
no matter how bothered he feels. The
opportunity may' not come again; let us
make all possible demands during that
week.
Everyone knows what happens in ordi-
nary weeks when you go to inquire for an
Australian book that does not happen to be
a perfectly fresh and well-advertised hot
pie. You ask. timidly, for a certain book of
essays. The salesman leans his ear, but
not too low. You repeat the name. He
hears, y r et, hears not; the name has no
meaning for him. You explain that the
book is by an Australian of repute and was
published in Melbourne six months before.
A smile as of happy release dawns on his
face: “Oh, now, madam, if you’d said at
once that it. was Australian ! But you
know our customers only care for the Best
Imported. If y r ou want essays, may I sug-
gest this book of John Oxenham’s?” He
may not.
The man who uses the wordg Best Im-
ported as if one half of the phrase explained
the other is at least sure of his ground. An-
other type is he who sets up to stock Aus-
tralian books. You call in and ask if he
has any of the poems by N, published some
years ago. You are interested to hear that
he has, as the book was said to be out of
print. He assures you that he has a supply;
he has even 70 copies, and the only reason
that nobody sees them is that the whole
70 live in the basement! The bookseller
himself remembers they are there; his
assistants all tell you there is no such book
and never has been. Perhaps the book-
seller feels that X’s poems are safer against
theft, in the basement; pei’haps he thinks
it, pays him better to give shop room to
books from abroad.
These are not imaginary cases. Another
was like this. I was in the country and
wrote to a bookshop to say I would be in
town next week and would like three copies
of a certain book published in that city.
I mentioned it in advance in case the book-
shop was out of it. It was a small book,
taking little shell-room, and there ought to
be a quiet, steady sale for it. When I
reached town, I found the bookseller had
refused to handle it or order it. He had
sold a few dozen when it first appeared,
and that was enough; the publisher was not
prominent. I was able to hunt him out and
buy the copies direct, but he was not a
retailer in the ordinary sense. There you
had it; he was not a retailer, and he could
not sell wholesale to the shops that were
unwilling to buy.
Sometimes it is possible to jest about
the whole sorry business, but the wheels of
amusement soon become clogged with de-
pression. It is not necessary, perhaps, to
blame the bookseller, who himself is caught
in the machinery of commerce. Our only
chance, then, is this Australian Authors’
Week ( and its possible after-effects. If for
one week we can ask for Australian books
with hope and without shame, perhaps the
bookshops will begin to think that a de-
mand for these books is almost within limits
of the normal. Perhaps the few Australian
shelves that exist in the shops will not this
year become flooded by imported Christmas
cards and calendars the very weeks
when most people are looking through the
shops for something to buy. Perhaps our
prowess in this short open season for book-
sellers will put us customers in a perman-
ently stronger position. And if this note
sounds very hostile to the bookselling pro-
fession. what is friction but a sign of life?
It is m3’ hope that, such friction may pro-
duce and sell more genuine Australian
books.
LALAGE.
The Journalist’s Bone
1 lie professional scribblers of Fleet-street
have always had their troubles, but to-day
they' are very heavy and on the increase.
Some of the more recent may be sum-
marised:—
T lie amalgamation of newspapers, maga-
zines and book-publisliing houses.
The “descent” into journalism of persons
in other professions, such as doctors of law
and medicine, heads of colleges and parsons.
The "ascent” into journalism of sport-
champions —• jockeys, prize-fighters, cricket
and tennis cracks, etc.
The admittance into the Beauty and
Fashion pages of titled persons and cinema
and stage stars.
The coming back to Fleet-street of the suc-
cessful author.
Almost any English newspaper, from the
dignified Conservative organ to the most
piffling rag, bears evidence that many hands
are stretched out to snatch the bone from
the pot of the poor professional scribbler.
He is defending it as best he may, but
the predatory ones are far more successful
in their thrusts.
There is no room for sentiment about it.
The employer of the professional penmen
has gauged what the new public wants, and
it is apparently the champion’s own account
of himself and his record-breaking; the
beauty’s own tale of how to achieve and
retain beauty; the public, ho argues, feels
more intimately in the know when it gets
the information in that way. 01 course
the story in its ultimate shape is not always
the product of the champion him- or her-
self, but sometimes of the hack who has
licked together a tumble-down English.
Often enough, though, the professional writer
is not called in to the job at all. In the case
of the parson, educationist, etc., the articles
are, as a rule, authentically first hand. “Legi-
timate enough,” as a disgruntled scribe said
to me recently, “if the parson were telling
his readers how to get to Heaven, if the
educationist were blazing a new royal road
to learning.” But, these gentlemen are do-
ing nothing of the sort; they are talking at
large about everything or anything. The
Dean of St. Paul’s, for instance, gives us his
opinion of the shingled flapper in an even-
ing paper.
The amalgamations in themselves were
menace enough, for Big Business reaches
out its hand more and more. The present
is its hour. In periodical literature and in
book publishing the last year or two have
seen great changes. One already big London
publishing firm last year “absorbed” nine
others, and, it is said, has its mouth open
for more. But it is the amalgamations in
tin 1 periodical press, daily and weekly par-
ticularly, that have caused the most, alarm
among professional journalists. And there
is nothing to be done. Those rvhose bone
is snatched can but join the other out-of-
works on the Embankment. Men who
have reached the Temple of Literature by
way of Fleet-street have returned to the
old hub, and are plying their old craft,
tempted thereto by Big Business’s Big
Cheques. Thus Wells on the Sunday
Express, Arnold Bennett on the Evening
Standard, and many others who are receiv-
ing fat royalties from literature with a
capital L.
The poor journalist has to defend his
bone against all these. Truly he has his
hands full, his pot not always so full.

The A.J.A. and the Writer
In the matter of the A.J.A. and Louis
Esson, Mr. Sayers puts the case for the
A.J.A. very fairly; but even he does not
know of the work that the Sydney Authors’
section has put in, without any boost to
itself, within the past 18 months. Its activities
during that period include a constant batter-
ing at the N.S.W. Education Department for
50 p.c. of the literary matter therein to be
purely Australian; worrying the Minister
for Customs (Mr. Pratten) for duties
against dumped imported literature; send-
ing a proposal for withdrawal from the
Berne Convention to the Rome conference;
assisting authors in their fight against dis-
honest publishers and agents; and sending
a trial parcel of Australian fiction to an
accredited London literary agent, with the
promise of making him sole agent if, and
so long as, he can get us satisfactory results.
No; the Authors’ Section, N.S.W. Branch
of the A.J.A., is anything but moribund.

Jew Suss
With my copy of Lion Feuchtwanger’s
Jew Suss, translated from the German by
Willa and Edwin Muir (Seeker), came an
eight-pa~e pamphlet of eulogistic criticism
of the work in its original form. Notwith-
standing all this weight of evidence, it is
a great historical novel. Brilliantly con-
ceived and executed, it stands out in im-
pressive isolation from the mass of literary
flapdoodle that chiefly exercises the print-
ing presses in this year of Sloppy Fiction
1927. It does so because it is the work of
an artist, because Feuchtwanger is a man
who doesn’t care a damn whether he has
a Yiddish Society for the Protection of
Poor Authors backing him or not, a man
capable of producing his work irrespective
of the personal cost—in other words, a
man that Australian authors who think
cotton-wool is a panacea for their ills might
do w T orse than study.
Feuchtwanger was born at Munich in
1884, began to write at 16, became a
Doctor of Philosophy and now lives in
Berlin. He has a European reputation as
a playright, “Jew Suss,” his first, novel, being
adapted from an earlier play. It was com-
pleted in 1922, though the political situation
prevented its being published before 1925.
The next of his books to be published in-
English will be “The Ugly Duchess,” which
has had a better sale in Germany than
“Jew Suss”—probably an indication that, it
is not. so good.
The story of the. Jew (actually he is a
Gentile, but that is a detail) is' anything
but beautiful. It is a history of the Duchy
of Wurtemberg under Karl Alexander,
1733-37, with Jewry triumphant as its theme
and with a double-action revenge plot which
makes tragedy inescapable. It contains in-
cidents as sordid and coldly horrible as
the worst imagined in the last year or so
by English and American sensation-
mongers, with the magnificent difference
that even the basest things Feuchtwanger
introduces seem historically and otherwise
essential. There is no more sordid thing
in the literature of my experience than the
young girl murdered by her uncle and left
on the dunghill for the swine, and none
that is more necessary in its place. That
most of these details are true to history
does not matter, but that the work is his-
torically true in general is most important.
It provides powerful ammunition for the
student of evolution. The world, humanity,
despite the horrible things that go through
our courts daily, has improved vastly since
the middle of the eighteenth century. Men
are not so lascivious as the Karls and the
Susses, nor are women so acquiescent and
accessible: if they would be, the changed
conditions of society effectually curbs them,
and will eventually reform them. Feucht-
wanger does not say this; he does not point
morals; but this is one of the greater things
he teaches. He himself is no reformer. A
thoroughly impersonal writer, he appears
to accept his vast host of characters as he
finds them; he makes no apologies for their
manifold failings, nor passes any judgment
upon them. The hands into which he has
given the proud but tattered banner of
Jewry are few of them clean, but the vic-
tory is magnificent.
It has been announced that “Jew Suss”
is to be adapted for screen production. It
should make a splendid picture, as well as
a highly remunerative one. The scenario
writer will find in it a panoramic back-
ground of uncommon magnitude and splen-
dor, a story of great dramatic power, a
wonderfully picturesque central character
and adequate support, with a note of mysti-
cism that would tempt the average producer
into wild adventures in faked photography.
(The sexual element, which is very large,
and would, of course, be made much larger
in proportion on the screen, would guarantee
overflow houses anywhere on earth, and
probably on Mars as well, though that does
not prove we are not advancing morally.)
Here are the larger ingredients at the scen-
ario man’s disposal. First, a, Jew who
delights in elegance backing the fortunes
of a penniless prince and rising with him
to great power. In this Jew’s background
a beautiful daughter, young, chaste, living
with a mystic rabbi in a garden-surrounded
house in the midst of a wood. From the
distant locality of this wood a gentleman
and his daughter go to the court of the
Duchy, and in Suss’s house the daughter is
compulsorily taken by the duke. Rightly,
the father blames Suss, and plots to visit
the same fate upon the Jew’s daughter
through the same agency, the duke. Then,
when sudden death saves this girl, the Jew’s
carefully-plotted revenge against the duke;
and, finally, an ending which stuns the
imagination.
Of course, the picture-makers will make
a botch of it. In spite of their good
conceit of themselves they are very young
in their art. Evolution has scarcely touched
them or it. And it takes a long while to
evolve art comparable to Feuchtwanger’s.
CECIL MANN.
A Satchel of Books
Many Furrows, by “Alpha of the Plough”
(Dent). A volume of “The Wayfarer’s
Library,” this is a collection of bright and
brief essays. They cover a wide range from
“A Day with the Rees” to “The Case of Dean
Inge: who can neither sing nor make a
joyful noise.” A book for an idle day.
Ariane, by Claude Anet, translated by Guy
Chapman (Alfred Knopf; Robertson and
Mullens). Most love-stories are about any-
thing but love. They arc usually about the
triumph of convention over lovers. This tale
of a Russian girl’s amorous experiences in
Moscow is as free from ordinary social
trammels as the Soviet’s matrimonial laws.
It is written with all the classic French
nicety of form and expression.
Mac Robertson Abroad. The “Welcome
Home” committee formed by the staff of
Australia’s confectionery millionaire has
issued, with the founder’s financial backing,
a liandsomely-got-up and generously-illus-
trated book containing a reprint of their
chief’s diary written during a world-tour of
1926-27. The proceeds derived from its
sales will be donated to the Employees’ Sick
and Accident Fund. It thus serves the
purposes of tribute and thrift. That the
diarist should find his chief interest
in the industrial world and more especially
in confectionery is to be; expected, but his
frank criticism of men and affairs is in no
way circumscribed.
WhOlc-meal, by Ettie A. Ilornibrook
(Heinemann). “Not by meat but by whole-
meal shall ye find salvation” is the gospel
according to Mrs. Ilornibrook (Ettie Rout).
Notwithstanding the fact that medical men
are at variance l on the saving properties of
whole-meal products and one frank Philis-
tine declares that it doesn’t matter a button
whether the white loaf or the brown appears
on the breakfast-table, this lady, supported
by equally authoritative opinion, holds
stoutly to her slogan
The whiter the bread
The sooner you’re dead.
A bunch of recipes useful to the housewife
who is interested in supplying vitamines for
the health of the family is appended.

Rainbow’s End.
Take this gift that the red gods send:
The will o’ the wisp at the Rainbow’s End —
Priest and parson, and poor man’s friend,
It waits for you at the Rainbow’s End,
Life and laughter and love and song;
And the green-eyed god and the fancied
wrong
I laven’t a place when the red gods send
The will o’ the wisp at the Rainbow’s End.
Chase the Rainbow across the sky,
Over the hills where the tall trees lie;
Still your heart and your fancied fears
As you climb the hill to the Vale of Tears;
Watch your step as you cross the glade,
And take my hand if you feel afraid.
'For you have to fend when the red gods send
The will o’ the wisp at the Rainbow’s End.
Down the valley and past the stream,
Jilt the image and woo the dream;
Lonely and laggard, and halt and blind,
The crazy world will be left behind ;
And come with me where the slow wind
blows
Scent of the honey and scent of rose;
Bathe your hair in the warm, wet rain—
And all your dreams may be gold again!
What do you want at the Rainbow’s End?
Love and laughter? A song? A friend?
Tangle of stars in a moon-mad sky?
Or a lonely thought w’here the tall trees
lie?
But ah! the Rainbow is like the flight
Of thistledown in the fading light—
For all you’re wanting the red gods send
In a pot of gold at the Rainbow’s End!
And it wouldn’t be right if you caught,
my friend,
The wall o’ the wisp at the Rainbow’s End!

The Tryst.
I waited for you
Till the darkness fell.
And I heard the clocks
The slow hours tell.
I waited for you
While the night grew chill.
Till the city slept
And the streets were still.
Dawn reddened the sky
When your summons flew,
But Death won the race
That I ran to you.
So now I must wait
Till Eternity
If I’d keep the tryst
That you made with me.

DOROTHY FRANCES PERRY.
The Pipes of Spring.
There is some wizardry abroad these days,
For every lane and every road I take
Seems to be flooded with a rainbow haze
That sets afire a thirst I cannot slake.
My maddened brain succumbs, and all aflame
My spirit rushes with the wind away,
Seared by a vast desire words cannot frame.
And, fearful while this ecstasy holds away, i
Leaps into a hollow, amethyst
With noontide shade, and there is swiftly
clasped,
Rolled in the bracken, hot and fiercely kissed
By fauns and nymphs with girdles all
unhasped.
!
One beckons me. I hesitate, am lost!
His melting eyes, long-lashed and shadow- !
dark,
To my warm heart some message now have
tossed,
Have kindled in my body some red spark.
I say that I am lost! I follow him
Down spangled and fern-fronded alleyways ;
And now in dappled grotto, gold and dim,
I know that he is waiting. Still he stays!
When I creep in he takes my trembling
hands.
I feel his own a-shake with numb desire.
Back, back below a fern-tree’s scalloped
strands!
Back, back beneath a swarthy face afire!
Down in the undergrowth, still wet with
dew,
Low down among the crackling, russet-
leaves !
Quick, quick while every bud bursts pale
and new
And nothing in the gladdened bushland
grieves!
Be hard and cruel when my lips you press!
For only thus and thus can 1 forget
Long, loveless hours of drabbest loneliness,
The bitter longing and the secret fret!
I’m sorry, humans! Some of you were kind.
But wind will call on spring’s first carefree
days!
The roseleaves bind my eyes, and I am blind ;
Things mortal vanish in a distant haze !
Oh that sweet piping! All the hills are fain
To start a-dancing with their purple
shoon,
Like us, when sweet night’s falling o’er the
plain,
To be Love's playthings ’neath a broad-
faced moon!

Sweet Bragi’s Harp Is Still.
Sweet Bragi’s harp is still
On every vale and hill.
All beauty now is dead,
With sun and flowers fled.
Earth-song, new-born and old,
He played on strings of gold,
And charmed the land and sea
With elfin witchery.
Upon the mountain-side
The nymphs forgot to hide;
The Huldra-folk did play,
While cattle roamed away.
But all is silent now!
No bud on bursting bough!
The sad, dark earth lies deep
In Winter’s grave, asleep!
O Bragi, pluck the strings,
And play forgotten things!
Strike out the wild refrain
That Idun walks again!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
She Looks Forward.
When I am old I wonder shall I go
Praising the past and say: “When I was
young
All the world bloomed in color, gold moons
hung
Lamps to adventure, and with red aglow
Each dawn’s brave banners flew, and joy
and grief
Struck flaming through the days, for then life
burned
Ardent with youth in me whom time has
spurned
And beaten down as winds a withered leaf.
“And, oh, unto the Islands never cling
Such sunsets now as then made sky and
sea
Incarnadine; and open then and free
All ways were, and, as great birds on the
wing,
The schooners flared it out of crescent
bays,
Palm-shadowed where the honey-yellow sands
Glowed as they glow not now in any
lands.
Color and laughter throbbed in those lost
days.”
Oh, all my prayer is that I shall not see
Days dawn when all the earth’s wild love-
liness
Joys not my heart, and I, through time’s
distress,
Gaze blind on beauty—cloud and lyric tree;
Noon as a sword upon a tropic town
Flushed with pink oleanders, swept with
grey ;
Pigeons a-flutter as amid them stray
Women with silver-circled ankles brown.
This may the gods grant me that I regret
No ecstasy of life, nor see the light
Burning of beauty sink to ashes white,
Cold where was fire once; ere I forget
That still the earth is fair, and still there
rise
Wonders with each sunrise and new moons
cast
Gold upon lovers new-—let me at last
Close eyes unsated ere all joyance dies.
FIJI.

One Night.
At Perry’s Farm, when o’er the sky
Great' leaden clouds uprolled—
Great leaden clouds foreboding storm —
The night grew bitter cold;
So cold it grew, so bitter cold,
That on the ridges dim
Tall mountain ash and turpentine
Seemed frozen, leaf and limb.
No night was this for out-of-doors.
So dread, so dark, so dire,
Wherefore with needles in our blood
We sought our good hearth-fire;
There, as a wind arose and howled
Outside —a wind gone wild —
Against the marrow-chilling cold
Red log on log we piled.
As there we crouched with hands outstretched,
What time the red flames fed
On bark and wood and writhing leaf,
'Twas little that we said;
’Twas little that we said, for each
v\ T as thinking, sombre-eyed,
What work the demon-wind was at
Upon the world outside.
Wild-galloping across the hills
It sped with loosened rein ;
Time after time it shook our doors
As though to entrance gain;-
The very smoke, as though it feared
That dread power in the gloom.
A panicked thing, a beaten thing,
Rushed back into our room.
Now shouting nigh, and now afar.
Loud shouting through the niglit.
Torn leaves, torn twigs before if thrust,
It raged o’er slope and height;
\nd ever as it voiced its rage,
Fierce, baleful and malign,
We heard some forest monarch crash
With broken limbs and spine.
Then at its height, as though a power
Revond its power had come
To still its rage, its baresark rage.
It suddenly fell dumb —
Fell dumb, and as around the fire
i We listened wondering
We heard no sound.... except, except
\ cricket chirruping.

THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1927.
HOGAN SETS AN EXAMPLE.
The legality of betting on the tripehounds
that chase the tin hare is being challenged
in Sydney, where the sport or pestilence has
been raging for a couple of months. When
arrangements were being made for the in-
troduction of the mechanical animal, the
Crown Law authorities were asked whether
McShortodds could accompany it to the
meetings as the law stood, and their reply
was unfavorable. So legislative sanction
was sought in the now notorious Gaming
and Betting Amendment Bill, introduced
by the remarkable Lazzarini —the same
measure provided for heaps more pro-
prietary racing and for the licensing of an-
other metropolitan course, all by way of
emancipating the masses—but Lazzarini
failed to get it. The Assembly approved
of the tin-hare clause, but the Council
struck it out, and the measure was passed
without it. It was then put to Attorney-
General McTiernan that tin-hare chasing
was coursing within the meaning of the
original Gaming.and Betting Act, and that
betting on coursing was legal, wherefore
he should administratively authorise tin-
hare bookmaking—over-ride Parliament, in
short. Having some respect for Parlia-
ment, McTiernan declined. So the tin
hare was introduced without McSiiortodds.
and without him it was a fizzle. It didn’t
“draw” enough to pay for the lights. Had
McTiernan remained Attorney-General
and stuck to his reading of the law, tin-hare
shares would have been a shilling a bushel
in a very short time.
But McTiernan went out of ofiice —was
thrown out, in fact, although he had saved
the ungrateful Lang from being deposed—
and Lysaght came in. The argument that
had failed to convince McTiernan con-
vinced the new Attorney-General. The ban
on bookmakers was removed, and the appa-
rently expiring enterprise became a roaring
success at once. Where three or four hun-
dred dejected spectators watched the tripe-
hounds pursue the electrically-controlled
quarry, 30,000 punters of all ages and both
sexes now struggle for room on Saturday
nights. Boys and girls have learned that
“you can get in for two bob and they
take two-bob bets,” so boys and girls are
conspicuous in the jostling crowds. That
betting is the attraction is made obvious
by the fact that many of those present can’t
possibly see the races from start to finish,
if at all; and the betting is of such a nature
that McShortodds can’t lose. McShort-
odds has also the advantage of being exempt
from the stamp duties on betting tickets
payable at horse and pony meetings, while
the tin-hare syndicate has apparently deter-
mined to race as often as it pleases, although
horse-racing is limited by law even in the
case of a great institution like the A.J.C.
In fact, the tin-hare business, thanks to
Lysaght’s ruling, has became a law to it-
self. One result is that the £1 shares which
threatened to be worth a shilling a bushel
have changed hands at £6. Another is that
would-be exploiters of the new craze arc
forming companies all over the place.
Lazzarini said, probably with his tongue in
his cheek, that the tin-hare clause which
the Leg. Council heaved out would apply
exclusively to recognised coursing grounds
(“the only place where a mechanical hare
may be chased by a dog is on a licensed
coursing ground”) and would provide “no
greater opportunities for-betting than now
exist.” As a matter of fact, the tin hare
is not being pursued, nor apparently will it
be pursued, on recognised coursing grounds
—the coursing clubs proper arc sticking to
the old game—and with only one crowd
operating the “opportunities for betting”
have been multiplied prodigious!}'.
These promoters of tin-hare companies
are extending their manoeuvres to other
parts of the Commonwealth. They expect
a favorable reception from the Government
that runs the Golden Casket, but are not
likely to get one in South Australia,
although there is a fair amount of coursing
in that State. Their prospects are also
dubious in Westralia, which goes in for
electric-light trotting, and therefore has as
much night gambling as it can stand. In
Victoria the gentry have been definitely
rebuffed. That State has acquired a Labor
Government of a very different stamp from
the sorry gang that misgoverns N. S. Wales;
it has acquired a Government which aims
at higher objects than pandering to the
mob at every point. So when the hopes of
the tin-hare push were mentioned in Par-
liament, both Premier Hogan and Chief-
Secretary Prendergast declared that there
would be no betting on the business in Mel-
bourne or any other part of Victoria, if
they could help it. It is an attitude in
keeping with the plans of Hogan and his
Ministers for the financial and industrial
regeneration of their State and the develop-
ment of its starved outports, and it is to
be hoped they won’t weaken. As men of
the world, they must recognise that Vic-
torians already bet a great deal more than
is good for them. They can’t put betting
down, and it would be worse than useless
to try; but they can, and should, restrict it
to the forms of sport that already have it,
and see that the punter gets fair odds by
installing the totalisator. They should
throw a sanitary cordon round the thing,
as it were. Anyway, if they merely stick
to the policy announced by the Premier
and Prendergast. they will not only be
doing the right thing for Victoria, but will
perhaps shame the rulers of the Ma State
into following their example. Not the pre-
sent combination, which is past redemption,
but the next.
BABBITT IN THE PHILIPPINES.
I met Babbitt, Imperialist, for the second
time after many years on the wharf at
Manila, P.I. All who have read Sinclair
Lewis’s book will know Babbitt, in his
native habitat, at any rate. He began by
being one of the 250,000 citizens of a rising-
town in U.S.A. His face is shrewd, yet
somehow soft and sentimental; his appear-
ance is prosperous. His religion is go-
getting and democracy, though he has never
reasoned about his faith; his ci*edo is the
American Constitution, though he has never
read it; and his god is Calvin Cooi.idge
or whoever happens to be President. He
believes his business is conducted according
to the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount.
He boosts his home town as the greatest in
the State, and his State as the greatest in
the Union, and he is a 100 p.c. American.
He is a member of a semi-mystical associa-
tion called the Elks; he hates, but only
spasmodically, the Bolsheviks and the Pope,
and he believes that all men are born
equal, but he doesn’t believe they are en-
titled to equal wages.
Such is Babbitt, a rather incoherent
person, who, however, hides his inconsis-
tency when mixed with the millions of his
fellow Babbitts. But as the ruler and pro-
tector of subject races accustomed to con-
sistency. Babbitt is another story. Doubt-
less Britain has its Babbitts, but they are
not allowed to go abroad and apply their
doctrines to the peculiar problems ot
Asiatic government. A stringent examina-
tion, having little relationship to questions
of colonial development, but a great deal
to aristocratic notions of responsibility,
eliminates the British Babbitt from the
colonial civil service and sends out a stream
of public schoolmen with a profound beliel
in the rather inelastic machinery of British
justice and an immense distrust of the
doctrine of the equality of men, especially
if they are Asiatics. The American Babbitt
some time ago observed that the aristo-
cratic method of dealing with subject races
was suffering from set-backs. When the
Philippines fell into Babbitt's hands, a
quarter of a century ago, he saw in them
a golden chance to show I he old imperialists
of Europe a better way.
Babbitt greeted me like a long-lost
brother and took me to a sundae shop. He
smacked the Filipino waiter on the back
and called him Mike, although his name
was probably Manuelo. The action was
trivial, but symptomatic. The backs of
Chinese and Indian boys arc not slapped
in Singapore, Hong Kong or Pondicherry.
Babbitt saw nothing obnoxious in his slap,
but, when he opened a Filipino paper,
edited, written and printed by Filipinos in
the best style of American vituperation,
and found it full of the usual clamor tor
the recall of the American governor, the
weeding-out of Americans in the medical,
sanitary, educational and financial —especi-
ally financial —departments, and the im-
mediate holding of a referendum on inde-
pendence, he became purple and indignant.
He told me exactly what would happen
when the native 'politico got unfettered
hold on the exchequer—how the anopheles
mosquito would resume his rule when the
medical service lost the stimulus of Ameri-
can push and science, and how Japan would
step in the moment Uncle Sam folded up
his tents and departed.
We took a stroll into the Intramuros,
the old walled city which at one time was
the only portion of the country really
governed by the Spaniards. Babbitt bristled
at the sight of the Spanish priests flitting
by en route to a burial or fresh from a
confession. He could slap a waiter jovially
on the back, but he had a dim misgiving
that these dark, silent, dignified ecclesiastics
still supped with the Filipino soul in the
recesses of the spirit. He wrinkled his
nose at the walls of insanitary palaces. We
looked in at the doorway of a basilica
where Filipino maidens, like golden butter-
flies in wing cases of starched pina cloth,
were kissing what was left of the toes of
saints their mothers had kissed before them.
As a civilised being and a Protestant, the
sight amazed him. Some of those girls
had probably graduated through courses of
hygiene in the splendid colleges Babbitt
.and his countrymen had subsidised in
Manila. We went out into the country and
found a man behaving in a canal as no
man should behave in a canal.
Outside Manila, that queer mixture of
atap houses, mediieval palaces and the worst
architectural horrors of Babbitt’s own
home town, the landscape became again
thoroughly familiar. The rice fields were
being stirred by wooden ploughs drawn
by water buffalo. Women and children
were planting out the seedlings. Boys were
operating with their toes complicated sys-
tems of strings which put bird scares in
motion in a dozen cultivation plots. Our
motor-car threaded its way through a traffic
of women walking with pumeloes balanced
on their shapely heads, and bullock-carts
exuding the sickly smell of copra. We
might, have been in Siam under a native
theocracy; or in Java, under the benevolent
despotism of the Dutch; or in Cambodia
under the military rule of the French. In
other islands of the myriad constituents of
the Philippine group American constabu-
lary were losing their lives keeping the
peace between the Mohammedan Moros,
who remain the fighting race, and the
Christian natives, whom town-dwelling and
prosperity have turned into congenital paci-
fists. Up in the mountains the pagan abo-
rigines were about their peculiar rites in
connection with the tobacco season,
while in Manila the native legislators were
debating a proposal of American capitalists
to develop the rubber industry.
It, is in contemplation of this last that
Babbitt succeeds in putting a top on his
indignation. It stirs him more than the
knowledge that revolutionary clubs arc
flourishing in every village, that every
second youth is suspected of concealing a
rifle, and that Japanese agents arc openly
welcomed as blood brothers by the party ol
independence. For some reason Babbitt
regards the production of 75 p.c. of the
world’s rubber in British possessions as a
menace to U.S.A. He has been told that
the Philippines, the brightest jewel in
Uncle Sam's top-hat, contain enough good
land to supply, all his country s require-
merits, yet the native won’t let him
touch it. What is worse. Babbitt can't
make him touch it himself —or "do any
other goldarn thing.” For Babbitt has
given him the vote.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Livingston Hopkins.
Death cannot come so late that we ceast
to say it comes too soon. Livingston
Hopkins (“ ‘Hop’ ot' The Bulletin”) had
81 years of life; lie had done his work; he
had set all his affairs in order. Yet we
would have had him stay a little longer.
Happily, the going was, as lie would have
had it. swift. He made one of his frequent
calls at the office on Friday morning; he
entertained visitors on Friday evening;
before the stroke of midnight on Saturday
pneumonia had carried him off.
Born in Ohio, U.S.A., lie gave himself
early to the work of book and newspaper
illustration, and was already in the front
rank of his profession, employed chiefly on
Harpers’ publications, when in 1883 The
Bulletin decided that he was specially
suited to its needs. Though it took a little
while for his humor, upon which lie
depended greatly, to acclimatise and localise
itself, at the end of his first brief engage-
ment there was no doubt about the popu-
larity of his work ; and, prevailed upon to
renew his engagement, he settled down to
make Australia his home, and remained
with it for 44 years. One can hardly say
when he retired from active work. He
ceased to regularly fill a page of The
Bulletin 14 years ago, but thereafter hi'
occasionally used his pencil. He had many
years back become one of the little group
of working proprietors of the paper, and he
was one of the directors of the co. when
he died.
‘‘Hop” was the most genial of the humor-
ists whose drawings have appeared in Aus-
tralia. Though he could hit hard, he was
always good-tempered about it. And he
was finely generous. Old readers of The
Bulletin will recall his cartoon on the
passing of Henry Parkes. Parkes poli-
tically stood for almost everything that
Hopkins and The Bulletin opposed and
fought; but the drawing in which the great
cartoonist stood at his great opponent’s
grave was full of simple dignity and grati-
tude and regret. It was never necessary to
search for the meaning of a “Hop” cartoon.
Yet, while he stripped his work of every
superfluity, there has never been his equal
in Australia, and very rarely his equal any-
where. for dropping little bits of unexpected
humor into the elaboration of a plan.
The Bulletin counts it one of its great-
est, privileges that it had him among its
co-operators for so many years. It offers
its sympathy to the daughters who are left
behind-—his wife died 30-odd years ago.
And among that part of The Bulletin
which is in harness, there is sympathy, too,
for William Macleod, who was more than
“Hop's” artistic and business colleague for
so long; the years only served to maki
their friendship a more precious thing to
both of them.

The Rights ot the Accused.
An outstanding feature of British criminal
law is its scrupulous regard for the rights
of an accused person. Safeguard after safe-
guard has been provided to ensure that he
shall have a fair trial before a jury of his
countrymen. From the moment he falls
into the hands of the police till the jury
files out to consider its verdict, his in-
terests are watched. There are restrictions
on the admission of police evidence; on
the admission of any confession or state-
ment he may have made; or of evidence
given on dying declaration; or of the evi-
dence of accomplices or of children. He
himself is not liable to be called as a
witness for the prosecution though compe-
tent to go into the box if he so desires, and
in many British communities —N. S. Wales
for example—it is not lawful to comment at
his trial on the fact that he has refrained
from doing so. He has the right to chal-
lenge any juryman, and if he is a poor man
the Crown will provide him with counsel
for his defence. Whatever his past record
may have been, it cannot be dragged into
court; nor is he—should he give evidence-
liable “to be questioned on cross-examina-
tion as to his previous character or ante-
cedents, without the leave of the Judge.”
Broadly speaking, everything is excluded
from evidence against him which does not
tend to prove tl*e offence with which he
is charged. He is presumed to be innocent
until he is lawfully proved guilty.
How jealously the Courts guard these
rights of an accused person was illustrated
by a case recently heard in Sydney.
Charles Ewan Cameron appealed to the
Court of Criminal Appeal from his con-
viction before a Judge sitting as Chairman
of Quarter Sessions in June last on a charge
of having fraudulently omitted to pay cer-
tain moneys received by him. and upon
which he was sentenced to 12 months’ im-
prisonment. The ground of his appeal was
that the principal Crown witness had been
allowed to give in evidence imputations
against his character for honesty. Refer-
ences had been made to him as a “crook"
and “a kerbstone agent” known to all the
detectives, and other expressions had been
used regarding him calculated to prejudice
him in the eyes of the jury. As usual in
such cases, the trial Judge furnished a
report. In it he pointed out that, though

NO INCREASE IN PRICE.
it was open to him to do so, counsel for
the defence had raised no objection to this
evidence being given.
Probably it was assumed that by giving
it the witness would discredit himself in the
e.yes of the jury. This view, however, did
not commend itself to the Court of Appeal.
The mere fact that counsel for the defence
did not complain against its admission was
in its opinion no reason why the trial
Judge should not have intervened and ex-
cluded it, in fairness to the accused. He
had, in fact, allowed such statements to
be made without rebuke. “It is of the
utmost importance,” remarked the Chief
Justice, “that in the administration of
criminal law the proceedings should be
conducted with complete fairness to the
accused. What occurred at this trial, with-
out rebuke on the part of the learned Judge
and the Crown Prosecutor, I trust will
never be allowed to occur again.” Cameron
was thereupon granted a new trial of his
case.
• ♦
Jack Tweedledum and Tom Tweedledee.
One of the reasons why the free and en-
lightened electors of New South Wales
don’t take much interest in the coming
elections is that there isn’t much in them
to take an interest in. The Nationalists
have said that J. T. Lang is under the Com-
munist thumb. The Laborites have re-
torted that Tom Bavin dances to a tune
piped by the Employers’ Federation. So
far, so good; but Lang grows almost lyrical
as he tells audiences in the swankier parts
of Sydney how un-Communistic he is, and
Bavin goes out nightly to assure the horny-
handed that Lang stole most of his plat-
form from the Nationalists. Child Endow-
ment, the 44-hour week, the latest frills on
Workers’ Compensation and even “Good
ole Piddo’s” efforts in the wage-boosting line
are all given a pat on the head by the
gentleman who is supposed to lead the
Opposition.
“We do not stand for any reduction in
the standard of living of the workers,”
says the Nationalist mouthpiece. But he
murmurs regretfully that the only way to
maintain the standard is to increase pro-
duction; which seems to imply that ho
thinks the standard is at present a bit
in excess of a fair thing. He doesn’t, how-
ever, face the corollary that the standard
will have to come down if production
doesn’t improve. Both Lang and Bavin
know well enough that if it wasn’t for the
circulation of a continual stream of bor-
rowed millions the howl of the wolf would
be loud in the land. The Ma State doesn’t
support itself and isn’t being encouraged
to do so by many of either its politicians'
or its papers. The electors being about 85
per cent, wage-earners it wouldn’t be a
pleasant task to tell them that they are
standing on a greasy plank which tips up
just a little more every year. When it tips
right up and sheds its load, Bavin will be
able to quote Hansard in favor of a theory
that he always said it would; but any toler-
ably honest historian of those times will
record that Bavin spent much of. his time
sitting on the heads of such incurable
realists of his party as Theodore Hooke
Hill, and imploring them not to talk
about horrible possibilities.
To say that Langism is rotten and repre-
hensible is understandable—even commend-
able. Anybody might say that, and a good
many members of Lang’s own party have
said it. But Bavin says it in a way that
suggests that Langism is quite all right, but
in the wrong hands. The plain fact is that
Lang has been a bigger calamity than he
otherwise might have been because the
other side forgot one of the first rules of
politics—the rule that it is the business of
an Opposition to oppose. Had they taken it
as an axiom that Lang is always wrong they
would have been always right—or so nearly
right that the lapse from righteousness
wouldn’t have mattered. Instead, they say
he stole their thunder, which is a most
damning reflection on both sides.
Wireless for Coastal Craft.
Facts support the plea of the Associated
Chambers of Commerce that every ship of
100 or more gross registered tons should
be compelled to carry wireless signalling
gear. N. S. Wales and Bananaland have
approved the idea; but as a State’s powers
only cover craft trading between its own
ports, an amendment of the Federal Navi-
gation Act is obviously needed.
When six years ago the Act made wire-
less outfits compulsory on ships of 1600 or
more gross tons, it even excluded from that
loose safeguard all river and bay ships and
coastal craft of any tonnage not trading
more than 100 miles beyond a home port.
Yet some shipping companies raised a howl
that the reform would cost about £IOOO
per ship per annum, and would be useless
on colliers and other comparatively small
ships that travel close inshore and are sel-
dom out of sight of some headland station.
The cos. were wrong on both those
counts. When the urgent need for such
gear on coastal craft was raised last year
in the Reps., Minister Pratten declared that
the annual cost of installation and operator’s
wages would total only £440. He sug-
gestively added that experimental wireless
telephones had been installed on some
trawlers working out of Sydney that gave
an effective call-range of 100 miles, and
involved a rental of only £220 p.a.
The objection that, wireless is unneces-
sary on small coastwise craft was refuted
when the Queensland coaster Dorrigo went
down off Double Island Point on Good
Friday, 1926. It was afterwards found that
three big ships with wireless gear vvere
within calling range; but because the little
craft had no wireless means of signalling
for help the entire crew went down, with
the exception of the captain and his son.
Even the two survivors were 34 hours in
the water before the Moruya chanced to
pick them up.
Wireless gear for ships is comparatively
inexpensive, and not even the smallest
coastwise trader should be allowed any
longer to endanger its crew needlessly for
lack of an amendment to the Federal Navi-
gation Act. It is 14 years since the burn-
ing emigrant ship Volturno, in mid-Atlantic,
called to its aid four distant ships repre-
senting as many nationalities—a cruising
league of nations tnat saved 500 people
from the blazing hull. Since then the value
of wireless sea-calls has been repeatedly
proved for all sorts of craft, including the
big wind-blown freighter France that was
wrecked off Noumea, and the waterlogged
schooner Helen B. Sterling, whose entire
crew was saved in the Tasman Sea by a
wireless call to H.M.A.S. Melbourne. Before
its last fateful voyage the Helen B. Sterling
was delayed three days at Newcastle to
renew some of its wireless parts and to put
the whole signalling gear in first-class order.
Three days well spent!

Jinks of Sligo.
Across the drab page of political history
struts the figure of John Jinks, of Sligo,
who saved Ireland from De Valera by not
being there. For a few hours the Four
Kingdoms debated the mystery of the
absence of Jinks. Some said it was the
drink that had got the man; others feared
he had eloped with one of his barmaids.
But it wasn’t anything like that. After
listening carefully to all that could be said
for De Valera and all that could be said
against Cosgrave, he decided that he ought
not to vote for the one or against the other,
and walked out of the Bail. It was a
masterly move, and Ireland and the other
components of the once-L'nited Kingdom
have reason to be grateful.
The Dominions also emit a sigh of relief.
The importance of the episode, of course,
lies in the revelation of the value that may
attach to the vote that isn’t given. In
Federal Australia, N. S. Wales, Queensland,
Maoriland and some other places electors are
compelled to enrol themselves and to cast a
vote. A good many of them, it may be
guessed, do it like the punter who believes
in Divine guidance and sticks a pin through
the racebook. Old ladies are haled into
booths to express an opinion on some
matter of Federal constitutional law when
as a matter of fact they don’t know the
difference between the Federation and the
Constitution, and couldn’t distinguish a
law from either of them if it walked up
and bit them in the leg. John Smith
of Woop Woop, whose mighty brain is
obsessed with speculations as to what will
win the ’urdles, is torn away from such
meditations to say whether Brown, the
Red candidate with Conservative leanings;
Jones, the Nationalist candidate who is a
bit of a Radical; or Robinson, the Inde-
pendent who claims to be an Individualistic
Socialist, ought to represent him in Parlia-
ment. Smith frankly does not care. All
he wants to know is what is going to win
the ’urdles, and the political situation in-
trudes itself as an irrelevant impertinence.
He votes for Brown, because if he doesn’t
vote for someone he’ll be fined £2, and
Brown by alphabetical right comes first.
Brown gets in by one vote and Brown’s
party gets a majority of one and rules the
State more or less badly or well for three
years, by the grace of John Smith, who does
not remember what bloke he voted for and
cares not who makes the country’s laws
so long as he can make a little book with
the tobacconist round the comer.
To compel people to vote who don’t want
to vote and who, if left to themselves,
wouldn’t vote, is pure foolishness. It isn’t
even as if any party could be sure of getting
some advantage out of it. From a Labor
point of view it looks feasible to suppose
that the wage-earning classes are more
absent-minded. on election day than squat-
ters and lawyers and other capitalistic-
minded persons. But Massey, of Maoriland,
imposed compulsory voting on the Fern-
landers because he reckoned that the
farmers were liable to forget the necessity
for supporting his party, and almost every
Liberal leader throughout the Dominions
cherishes the notion that his party never
pulls its full weight at the polls. A really
intelligent State would charge the voters a
bob a head, and would make them pass an
examination in current politics before it
allowed them to handle a ballot-paper. And
if a qualified voter emulated Jinks and
walked out without exercising the franchise
it would return him his bob.

The God of the Politician.
The Public Works Committee of Tasmania
is examining the proposal to bridge the
Derwent near Hobart. The occasion is not
unsuited for examining the constitution and
functions of the Public Works Committee
itself; and what is true of this one is true
of almost every other in Australia.
Some years ago, when no such committee
existed, the Minister was responsible for
the outlay on works, which were sub-
mitted to Parliament. Appeals for this job
or that were constantly coming in from
every quarter, and the Minister was com-
pelled to face either the responsibility of
recommending or the unpopularity of re-
jecting them. The idea then was conceived
of freeing as far as possible the expenditure
on public works from political influence by
appointing a committee of members from
both sides of the House to report on
schemes of any dimensions before they were
presented to Parliament.
For plausibility it would be hard to sur-
pass such a scheme. What is more reason-
able than that all requests from sundry
local bodies should be dealt with by an
impartial committee rather than left to the
biased judgment of a party Minister! In
actual fact it was just a clever dodge for
evading responsibility, and resulted, as most
clever political dodges do, to the detriment
of the unhappy public. Party is admittedly
illogical and a makeshift. Its main justi-
fication is that the actions of the Govern-
ment must be able to face the hostile eriti-
cism of the Opposition. This vital prin-
ciple was nullified by the appointment of
this committee, since its members are
drawn from both sides of the House. If a
blunder is made and the Opposition starts
to whet its claws, it is promptly realised
that Brother This or Brother That was on
the committee and would be involved in
the attack! The result is that disgraceful
things are done and condoned. A local
example was the extension of a privately-
owned tramway at Zeehan at Government
expense. The result is that the State now
owns about six miles of tram, built at
a cost of many thousands of pounds, which
is separated from Zeehan by some eight
miles of private line; and at the best the
line was put in mainly to procure timber
and firewood and was a hopeless proposition
from any point of view. It is doubtful if
any Government could have faced criticism
on such a wanton waste of money, but—it
was approved by the Public Works Com-
mittee and not a voice was raised in the
House.
The vital error lies in placing the decision
in the hands of politicians at all. The
problems are nearly all of engineering and
finance. As a matter of fact, they are not
seriously considered. Votes are the poli-
tician’s god. To votes he refers everything.
By votes he measures everything.

The Liquor Trade in N. S. Wales.
By September 30 the N.S.W. Licenses
Reduction Board expects to have done its
work. So far it has wiped out 288 hotels
and 61 wdne-licenses, and the cleaning up
has gone beyond the elimination of places
that were sheer drinkeries; in order to hold
their licenses owners have improved their
premises out of all recognition, especially
where the improvement w T as most needed.
The trade itself found the compensation
(£609,685 all told) by paying into a fund
from which there will be a balance which is
to go back to the contributors, but might
fairly, if the law allowed it, be taken tor
the hard-up hospitals, since the continuing
hotels have benefited and will benefit enor-
mously by the extinction of rivals.
The board’s work is one that can be
given warm commendation; the few unfair-
nesses which have come to light have been
the result of tricks which could hardly be
countered—as an example, the payment ,of
heavy compensation to the proprietor of
a Surry Hills drinking-sliop, who, knowing
the end was coming, built up a sly-grog
and after-hours trade and was rewarded by
big compensation, whilst a near neighbor,
trying to observe the Liquor Act in a pub
into which he had bought at a price boosted
by similar malpractices, was given less than
half the amount he had paid.
What the board has failed to do, how-
ever, is to compel hotels to give to the
public the conveniences they are supposed
to maintain in return for their privileges.
A multitude of them still refuse to those
who need it the food and lodging to which
they are entitled by the terms of the license.
In Victoria the Licensing Board estimates
the value of the pub to the community
more upon the accommodation available
for board and lodging than upon the liquor
sales, which is putting the hotel business in
proper order. As a consequence in Vic-
toria—Melbourne especially—almost any
hotel is glad to welcome the person in
search of board and bed; something which
will thaw the N. S. Wales publican’s frozen
attitude towards him is badly needed.

Carry the Campaign Home!
“In a campaign, keep off figures” is an
axiom among politicians. Most of them
overdo it and keep away from facts as well.
But in the coming N.S.W. elections figures
should play as great a part in the campaign
as they will in the final count. The Aus-
tralian worker isn’t a Red. He is, in the
main, a cautious person who can under-
stand plain statements. And figures given,
not in millions and decimal points, but in
terms of gas bills, ferry tickets and the
price he has to pay for his pictures, will
convince him that he pays for Labor’s
experimental legislation .no less than the
“bloated capitalist,” with the difference that
he is far less able to bear his share of the
burden. In particular, it should be com-
paratively easy to show him that, if he is
a shade above the basic wage standard, he
gets no benefit from the Family Endowment
fraud, but contributes largely to it; and
not merely to the support of poor kids, but
to paying overtime to thousands of already
fairly-paid public servants. And more
plain figures given in terms of industries
which close down because they cannot meet
the unreasonable demands made of them
will bring other pictures before him which
he can translate into the facts of his own
experience. Let the Nationalists leave loose
statements to Lang and his crowd and get
down to simple figures.
The Foot-slogger.
Urging that Australia must “mechanise”
its army, General Dodds said lately that the
day of the infantry-man was past, and
future wars would be fought by men in
small armored cars and tanks. The “mech-
anisation” of the Australian army is cer-
tainly needed; we are trailing 10 years
behind the world’s standards in tanks and
other fighting machines. But when the
General declares that infantry training is
useless, he talks nonsense. The mistake he
makes is that of the pre-war prophets who
spoke of the- future conflict as a battle
between machines. Actually in the Great
War the foot-slogger proved still the most
essential fighting force; although shells
could drive him down to his holes in the
ground, and tanks ride over him, other in-
fantry had to finish off the job by coming
over to take—and hold—the position.
In the A.I.F. the infantry casualties ran
out to 113 per cent, of the personnel drafted
in the fighting battalions, the excess being
accounted for by men who were several
times wounded; the artillery, next in im-
portance, had not quite 60 per cent, of
casualties. At least 80 per cent, of the
army was infantry, and that fact, combined
with the casualties, shows how much of the
fighting the infantry had to do. And what-
ever new inventions are introduced, the
infantry will have to do it again.
♦
Thf, terrorist campaign which has won a
temporary triumph in the Sacco and Van-
zetti case has been condemned in robust
terms in Australia. Yet it is only a week
or two since bodies of Australian unionists
made threats —admittedly not of violence —
against a Court and a Judge. And the wilful
flouting of decisions has become so common
as to pass almost without comment. “Ah!”
some bright person will rush in, “but that
concerns the Arbitration Court.” The
Arbitration Court is part of the judicial
system of the Commonwealth. The law
is the law. If Massachusetts makes a com-
plete surrender in the Sacco and Vanzetti
case, its judiciary will be degraded in the
eyes of the world. And if in Australia the
State stands supinely inactive while the
decisions of the industrial section of its
judiciary are flouted and defied, it will
find the scoffers and mud-throwers taking
ever-increasing liberties. Australia has been
gratifyingly free of the bomb-throwing and
mass violence of older lands. But with
professional sowers of discord everywhere
at work, mildness becomes a fault and
weakness a crime. The danger signs are
written clear, but the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment apparently prefers to run rather than
read.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Squalid rows about kerosene tins are a
feature of the N.S.W. Labor selection ballots.
In one case it is said that the specimen
used as a ballot-box might almost be called
an open vessel, so accessible was it. Another
disturbance arose- because an interloper was
getting away with the tin and contents, and
was stayed with difficulty. In a third
instance an effort was made to swap tins,
the substitute presumably containing bogus
votes. A kerosene tin is a vulgar and un-
dignified receptacle anyhow, and a dis-
honest kerosene tin is beneath contempt.
Premier Hogan (Vic.) tasted his first
victory in battle with the Opposition when
Kent Hughes, desiring to make sure that
public tendering would get a show in the con-
struction of Spencer-street bridge, moved an
amendment in committee on the bill to auth-
orise the building of the structure On the test
divL’ui the Government won by 33 votes to
23; the four Country Progs, and Everard,
Bodman, Forrest and McLachlan stood by
the Ministry.
In its plans for the construction of another
300-miles section of the South-to-North rail-
way the Federal Government has struck a
masterly yet simple idea. It proposes to
have all the materials made in Australia.
This ivill supply some employment and
wages, provided strike-makers permit the
employment, and it will leave no excuse for
borrowing gold in London or New York to
pay for either work or material. Should
the financing be done by a local loan the
paper money surplus or the paper money
sinking fund will provide for its repayment,
but no power on earth will provide, out of
Australia’s own resources, for either prin-
cipal or interest abroad unless this country
does a great deal more work or is content
with a vast deal less imported luxuries.
Sydney’s Labor Lud Mayor has been asked
to apply for a commission of inquiry so that
aidermen suspected of corruption may have a
chance to . prove their spotless innocence by
evidence, which might include submission of
their bank accounts in confidence to the pre-
siding Judge. His reply is that if the accu-
sers get evidence first (presumably by burg-
lary). and it is sufficient to satisfy him that
the Caucus of which he is a member isn’t
the clean potato, he will move. Otherwise
it seems that the suspects prefer to remain
under the blackest suspicion.
The S. Aus. Liberals have nominated old
John Verran for the Senatorship left vacant
by the death of Laborite Charles McHugh.
It was rather astute of them, for John was
a Labor Premier once, though he has been
a Nationalist or something since the con-
scription business. The Vardon precedent
lias been quoted as a reason why the Libs,
should appoint their own man in these cases
when they are in a position to do so. Vardon,
one of the Lib. Senators returned in 1906,
was unseated on petition to the High Court,
and Labor, having a Parliamentary majority,
put J. A T . O’Loghlin in his place, although
further High Court proceedings and another
reference to Parliament resulted in Vardon
getting the seat hack.
The mysterious disappearance of a large
vessel which left a Roumanian (Black Sea)
port some weeks ago and steamed into the
unknown has led to the theory that a Bol-
shevik element among the crew took pos-
session and carried the ship into a Russian
port. Those who live alongside the Soviet
push evidently consider it quite on the cards
that it would steal anybody’s steamer, or
receive it when stolen, and put the officers
and passengers where they couldn’t report
what had become of them. Under a consti-
tution which provides for execution with-
out trial any one may contract the vanish-
ing habit.
A new scene opened in the Irish Free
State Parliament when De Valera, the half-
Spanish gentleman from New York, marched
in with his 42 Republican followers and took
the long-delayed oath, strictly as a matter
of form. Under a proposed new T law, their
seats would have been declared vacant if
they had stayed out much longer, and they
would have been disqualified as candidates
unless they accepted the oath before going
to the poll, so they ended their sojourn in
the wilderness, which was a comedv busi-
ness and led nowhere. As a result the Cos-
grave Ministry would have lost the number
of its mess if Deputy John Jinks had been
present. In the absence of Jinks it was
saved for the moment bv the casting vote
of the Speaker, and did a long-distance
adjournment.
WHY BE VINDICTIVE?
“Vie. Chief-See. Prendergast told a deputation of ex-police strikers to seek public support, so as to
strengthen his hand —he was, personally, rather in favor of letting the strikers join up again.”
GENT WITH PAPER: “Are you one of the shopkeepers whose premises were smashed
and looted during the police strike?”
SHOPKEEPER: “Yes, and I got no compensation, either.”
GENT WITH PAPER: “Excellent! We’re the lads who let you down. How about a bit
of public support to get us back in the force again?”
“My life is an open book.” said a Sydney
Labor aldermen while charges and innuendoes
were flying around like dead ca+s. But some
books are not open at the really interesting
page.
Goulburn was a three-member constituency
at last N.S.W. election, and though Labor
skewered two of the seats it was only
because the other side threw away many of
its preferences. So hundreds of men have
been sent up from Sydney to do at least a
colorable imitation of toil on a road-making
job. If they all qualify to vote by a month’s
residence in the electorate they should come
in very useful, and, as was the case in
Westralia, the bill can be passed on to the
confiding Bruce. The arrangement is rough
on local unemployed, but doubtless something
will be promised to the latter to prevent a
political landslide on polling day.
The blowing-up of the detective office,
wtueu disturbed Brisbane on a recent mid-
night, may have been the inarticulate pro-
test of some local Communist against the
proposed execution of two murderers in Mas-
sachusetts, U.S.A. It is the stupid way of
the Communist gangster to blow up some-
thing wholly irrelevant in moments of
emotion and leave the losers to guess what
was meant by the disturbance. It is his
substitute for hieroglyphics and rock-carving.
Disregarding tradition, Vic. Parliament —
both Houses —provided chairs on the floor
beside the presiding officers for the Siamese
Princess Purachatra and her daughter when
they called last week with the Prince. It
would have horrified some of the old Con-
servatives to see women in seats of honor
at a business sitting. On session-opening
days petticoated visitors take all the best
places, but they have been rigidly kept out
of the sacred space reserved for members at
other times.
Just before Jinks of Sligo made history
in the Irish Free State, The Bulletin
was assured by Humphries, the proportional-
representation man, that his system, which
N. S. Wales is discarding, had been a magni-
ficent success in the Free State. One of its
merits, it seems, is that “it preserves power-
ful personalities for public life.” Well,
the thing was introduced here by the Holman
Government in 1920. Holman lost his scat
at. the first trial of it. and Parliament has
been without his powerful personality
ever since.
When certain Labor aldermen at Sydney
Town Hall proposed to pay some £65,000 and
subsequent rent and royalty to a private
capitalist for a coal deposit at Douglas
Park, 45 miles from the city, their gun
was to some extent spiked by the intimation
that the State was willing to grant coal lands
in the same locality for a modest rent and
royalty only. The State has now withdrawn
from the competition and intimated that it
won’t grant any land, but apparently it is
too late to get the old job on its feet
again.
A deputation from the Melbourne Trades
Hall Council and the police strikers of 1923
called on Chief Sec. Prendergast the other
f l” v to urge reinstatement of the dismissed
600. The proceedings bore all the appear -
mice of an “arranged” demonstration to
try to make an unconvinced majority of
the Labor Cabinet sit up and take notice:
and arranged it was. Prendergast expressed
sympathy, preached the forgiving spirit, urged
the pleaders to get the backing of public
opinion, and, of course, promised to take
the request to Cabinet. Perhaps Cabinet
will wait till the deputation comes again
with public opinion behind it. It would be
a safe —and long—wait. ,
H. E. Boote, who was writing for Aus-
tralian Labor many years before Willis,
Voigt, Gosling, Davies, Chapman, Donald
Grant and Garden condescended to come
here, was commanded to attend a Sydney
A.L.P. executive meeting last week and show
cause why he shouldn’t be silenced or shot
out of the “movement.” He refused, saying
that “the fraternal suppression of criti-
cism, so prevalent in Moscow, has not yet
been successfully established in this country.”
The A.W.U. stands behind its editor, and
the A.W.U. showed its power in the country
Labor ballots. Though the New Bosses
asserted that A.W.U. members were in full
revolt against their own organisation it was
the New Bosses that they revolted against.
This was particularly shown in the case
of young lload of Cootamundra, who is
impenitently pro-Loughlin. Out of one
A.W.U. box came 124 votes for Hoad and
one for Lang’s man.
The antiquity of the Port Phillip pilot
equipment got an advertisement when the
mate and one of the crew of the pilot
steamer Victoria put off at Queenscliff to
fetch a pilot and were blown to sea. The
mate, being old (past the retiring age, in
fact), perished of exposure; his companion
was only saved by his magnificent physique.
After 13 hours of drifting in Bass Strait,
during which a large mollyhawk nearly fin-
ished what was left of him, he was washed
ashore from the upturned boat. Queans-
cliff is one of the world’s stormy capes, and
the craft used is an open boat with a single
lug sail.
Another little storm lately commenced to
beat on the troubled shore of Piddington.
That needlessly Industrious Commissioner,
who made history by fixing a rural wage for
N.S.W. and promising to hear evidence as
to its practicability some time or other, made
one of his many blunders by defining what he
considered his position. The amazing Premier
presently announced that he was appointing
a Royal Commission not to inquire into
“Piddo's” attitude but into the attitude of
persons who remarked on his attitude. The
observations are viewed by Lang as “a reflec-
tion on the Judiciary,” but there is a ten-
dency to think that it reflected on itself.
There are some kinds of Judiciary which
shouldn’t stand before a mirror.
If the Pied Piper of Hamelin were to
take on a rat-catching contract with Syd-
ney’s Labor-ruled City Council he would have
no reason to growl at his remuneration, as
he did in the German instance. Each rat
caught by the Council's special staff last
financial year cost 12s. 6d. in the catching.
The daily average of the catch was one rat
per employee. A variation of the old “one
man one job” axiom apparently.
Federal Attorney-General Latham seized
a recent occasion to speak words of comfort
and healing at Geelong, where he said that
“a sinking fund would be established to pay
off the existing debt (State and Federal) of
over a thousand millions in 58 years, and
sinking funds would be created in connec-
tion with all new loans.” But the point
which the legal gentleman, like so many
other legal and illegal gentlemen, failed to
convey was that Australia may fill the
Exhib : tion Building with sinking fund after
the Exhibition is over, and yet it won’t
make an impression on the external half of
the debt, unless exports can be made to
exceed imports by over £30,000.000 pei
annum. In fact, two such noble structures
bursting with sinking fund won’t prevent
the external debt doubling inside 58 years
if existing conditions continue.
There seems more need for a capable finan-
cier in Free State Ireland than for heated
argument. Starting fair, the new State
has already acquired a debt of over
£10.000,000. and the money didn’t go in
railway building. The £2,170.500 allotted
last year to repair war damage didn’t fully
explain an estimated shortage of £0.000,000.
Imports have exceeded the exports which are
supposed to _ pay for them by as much as
£18,000,000 in a year, and how the balance
has been financed is something of a mystery.
A committee was being appointed to inspect
the finances when De Valera and his crowd
came home to roost, but its present where-
abouts is uncertain.
The Bulletin’s “Hop Memorial Num-
ber,” to be published September 1, will re-
produce the most famous of “Hop’s” cartoons
and other drawings. The size of the issue
will be increased so that this memento of
Australia’s most widely-known humorist will
be added to the ordinary contents. The
price will remain as usual.
CENSORIOUSNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Sydney alderman complained bitterly at a
special meeting of the City Council, that he had been
pursued by street hoodlums with taunts about cor-
rupt practices.”
He hurried to a meeting in committee,
Glowing with high intent and civic pride,
And heard a voice remark in accents gritty:
"One more of our municipal banditti!
I wonder what new frame-up on the city
They’re going to work inside?”
Without the hall he stood, his one ambition
To give the ratepayers an honest spin,
Fully determined under no condition
To cast a vote that might provoke suspicion.
And someone growled: “That bob-a-yard
commission !
D’you think lie’s standing in?”
Ilis virtuous demeanor seemed compelling
Enough all base suggestions to rebut.
Withal a murmur rose around him, swelling
To this: “If lie’s a cobber motor-selling
Or trafficking in pubs and things, no telling
But what lie draws his cut.”
Lastly, if some ingratiating vendor
Of collieries our Bumble’s help bespoke,
Hinting of quid pro quo that he might render
Could he secure a corporation-tender—
Isn’t it calculated to engender

“Kaktus Kate”: Drunks’ luck? A citizen
of Wellington (M.L.) was returning in the
small hours from a more than usually hil-
arious party. He was driving a large and
hefty Cubbitt car, and
as he sped on his
homeward way he de-
tached a verandah
from a group of shops
on the corner of a sub-
urban street and sailed
gaily on with a bent
radiator and much-
tangled ironwork deco-
rating the bonnet.
Enough beams to build
a large-sized fowl-house
were festooned over
the running - boards
and mudwings, but the
car was practically
undamaged, and no
glass broken. After a
sleep he crept guiltily
back to the scene of
action and found that
he had carried away
more than half the
verandah and left the
posts swinging drunk-
enly by a thread. The
owner of the damaged property had no clue
to the identity of the wrecker, but the
destroyer made a clean breast of it and paid
up £69 like a man.
“X.D.”: A tailor at East Brunswick
(Melb.) has had his house burgled seven
times in five years. On their last visit the
thieves pinned up a daily newspaper cutting
of three years back, describing how the snip
had chased them with a revolver. Then they
took the revolver.
“Sierra”: In Sydney's crowded lodging-
houses every stray gleam of sunshine has its
cash value. A number of windows in one of
the loftiest “residentials” in the city were
recently exposed to the orb of day by the
removal of an adjacent building.
The joy of the troglodytic ten-
ants at having the sun peep
into their gloomy lairs was sud :

room-rents accordingly.

few words about a defect in tlie law, winch
should be remedied before the next money-
lender is foully done away with. Daniels

most probable view is that he Avas killed by
a debtor avlio had backed the wrong horse, cr
proposed to back it, and who took the evi-
dence of his financial dealings with him in his
flight. As a result there was a round-up of
hundreds of the dead man’s customers, but
unfortunately it was no part of the police
duty to make each declare why he Avas driven
to Daniel’s den for accommodation. If this
had been done, probably it would have

some of the rest had done the same on a

Its name Avas Tim, she declared. Someone

the gardener shouted “Nip!” and the terrier

ran into the witness-box. The Bench bright-

the disputant Avent grimly into the, box and
brought the dog to her just as quickly with

THE JUDICIAL BLINKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Judges, however blind they may be to their own
defects, are always deeply conscious of each other’s
deficiencies.” —Lord Justice Bowen.
Tut! Tut! Justice Bowen ; your satire most
sly
Shocks our sense of what taste or good
feeling expects.
Do Judges contrive to keep a blind eye,
For their own as opposed to their brothers’
defects?
Let us look at some samples—fair standard,
if trite:
“With the utmost respect to the contrary opinion,
I deeply regret my inability to take the same view.”
“With the very greatest deference to the opinions
of my brethren I find myself reluctantly com-
pelled”. ...
Quite modest, you see, and profoundly polite.
Best models of etiquette, all must agree,
And manners that grace a profession
unique.
Could the timidest violet modester be,
Or a maiden betray more of blush on her
cheek?
Here’s another with just that desirable touch :
“I am painfully conscious of the great weight
of learning and authority and of the reasoning by
which the judgments are supported, neverthe-
less”. ...
Almost his Honor protesteth too much!
Sometimes, however, a devil of doubt
Creeps in to suggest a leaven that works
In the mind of the brother who takes the
knock-out,
That beneath all politeness a sarcasm
lurks;
And it always is found in the voice of
dissent:
“I have the misfortune to differ from the opinion
of my learned brethren. If it were not for that
opinion I should not have thought the question was
• reasonably open to doubt.”
“Unless this Court is to be regarded as possessing
a nearer approach to infallibility than the Privy
Council, no reason presents itself to my mind”....
Perhaps somewhat caustic, but very well
meant.
There are times, though, of course, when a
Solon astray
In the “Court of First Instance, ’ or just
“Court below,”
NOW, WHAT DOES THE GIRL MEAN?
“Have you any references?”
“Oh, a bundle!”
“Then, why didn’t you bring some?”
“Well, you see, the gentlemen haven’t put down half the things they’ve told me
personally.”
Must be put in his place in a summary way. i
No compliments wasted; a horrible show i
They make of his judgment and sweep up the i
wreck:
“The learned Special Magistrate appears to have 1
overlooked entirely the elementary rule of law as
previously laid down by this Court. The case^must
therefore" be remitted to him with a direction”
He’s a minor Court beak and it’s his in the
neck!
Though brethren exalted who sit alongside
Can’t be lectured on duty or talked to like
that. .
Yet “deference” sometimes delivers a wide
And “respect” and “submission” appear to
fall flat.
Still right must be done though the heavens
collapse:
“If I were not bound by the opinion of the
majority of this Court in Boshter’s Case, I should
unhesitatingly rule”
“As my learned brother Moses has seen fit to
refer to Boshter’s Case, I wish to say that in my
opinion that case has nothing whatever to do with
this one.”
Mr. Justice Snagg: “I think that proposition (of
counsel) is sheer nonsense.”
Mr. Justice Jagg (with great dignity): “That
proposition is also the considered opinion of my
brother Wagg and myself.”
Mr. Justice Snagg: “I still think it nonsense.”
Wise to others’ deficiencies? Well, yes, per-
haps.

reach the switch and realising
that to grasp the other would
be his own undoing, too, wasted
no time in going for rubber
gloves, but hauled off and hit
the partially-electrocuted man a
smashing blow on the jaw. The
only result was a paralysing
shock for the hitter, who quickly
rallied and pluckily put his last
ounce behind another wallop on
the same spot. The smitten
man collapsed, and, his muscles
relaxing, he let go of the
machine and fell clear. The
whole thing was over l before
some of the onlookers realised
that they weren’t watching an
impromptu scrap.

“Sol. M.”: A plain and ordi-
nary U.S. Judge has attained to
a fame which extends far
beyond that land of freaks and
dollars by advocating marriage
on trial or by instalments, the
parties to live together in un-
wedded bliss for, say, 12 months
and then either separate or
marry or stay on as they are.
He secured the cordial approval
of H. G. Wells, who is in the
front of every eccentric move-
ment, but so far Bernard Shaw
seems to have preserved an
ominous silence. The principal
snag which his Honor struck
was that he couldn’t definitely
provide for the baby, and lacked
the courage either to definitely
prevent the baby or to extir-
pate it should no marriage event-
uate. It ,seem/s curious that
an expedient of the sort should
be considered necessary in the
Land of Easy Divorce. B y
last-published figures Uncle
Samuel’s country had 136 dis-
solved marriages per 100,000 in-
habitants in a year to England’s
eight, and the Courts were
equal to any amount more busi-
ness. Probably it would be
found on investigation that a
much more urgent need is for
bigamy or polygamy, provided a
bit of the harem could be in-
duced to stay at home and solve
the servant-girl problem.
“Cactus” : Recent paragraphs about home-
made false teeth remind me of an old tin-
scratcher on Mt. Lewis who boasted a set
of wooden ones. He took the impression
of his gums with a piece of moist clay from
the creek where he worked, then cut a piece
of hardwood and set to work on it with his
pocket-knife. He always insisted that his
makeshift denture was O.K. except for the
trifling disability of being a bit rough on
his gums.

“Black Tracker”: Not long ago a firm of
London lawyers instituted inquiries for a
youthful derelict, heir to estates with an
income of £20,000 a year in England, who
was supposed to have sunk beneath the sur-
face somewhere in Australia. The sleuths
began their questing work in the slums of
Sydney and Melbourne; meanwhile • the
object of the search was leading the simple
life in a blacks’ camp on the Murrray River.
Although men employed on the irrigation
works were aware that there was a white
man at the camp they evinced little or no
interest in him, especially as he was said
to be mentally affected. But the description
of the wanted man contained in a circular
posted to the head of the irrigation works by
the Adelaide police set someone thinking,
and local officers were sent out to investi-
gate. They found the missing heir living in
much the same fashion as his hosts, and
shipped him back to England to claim his

“Night Out”: Driving home from the
party in the small hours it was forcibly
impressed on me that the once familiar horse-
trough Ims almost disappeared from the pre-
cincts of the suburban pubbery. We were
about four miles from home when the water
SOILED-ARITY.

in the radiator showed signs of exhaustion,
“S’all right,” said Curly, "I gotter billy in
the back; let’s find a pub.” But the Joiners’
Arms proved troughless and the Land of
Promise untrue to name. The Red Lion
and the Swan were equally disappointing,
but in front of the dolly Miller Curly gave
a whoop. Gleaming in the moonlight was
a unique drinking utensil. His exultation
was premature, for the trough had a hole
in it and the water had been turned off at
the meter. Sadly he put away his billy, and
we prepared to walk, for the radiator was
bone dry, when my foot struck against a
forgotten bottle of beer. Never shall I
forget the look of anguish in Curly’s deep-
set eyes as he knocked off the capsule and
emptied the precious liquid into the radiator,

Ex-Dig. : The queer phenomenon, known
to many Diggers, of the “feel” of pain in
a no longer existent limb was mentioned in
a cas e before the Workers’ Compensation
Commission the other day. The Commission
expressed astonishment when a claimant
mentioned that he had to take medicine to
relieve the pain in his artificial leg; but the
opposing counsel, who himself wears a sub-
stitute for a portion of his anatomy left
behind in France, contributed a pertinent
assurance that he occasionally felt pain in
the toes he had lost. It is a subject about
which the Digger humor gets its chance now
and then. An old cobber of mine was ex-
plaining that his limp was due to the rheu-
matism he felt in his purely-mechanical foot.
“I reckon they must be having some rotten
slushy weather in France just now,” he added
with a grin.

“Chip Carter”: I went into a small book-
shop for a copy of Zane Grey’s “The Vanish-
ing American.” “The Vanishing Race” is
the movie version. Inadvertently I asked for
the book by the title of the picture, only to
be informed by a girl in her early ’teens that
there wasn’t a copy in stock. "But we’ll get
you one,” she added brightly, writing “The
Vanishing Race” on an order-form. I was
about to correct my mistake when she looked
up with “By Dr. Marie Stopes, isn’t it?”

“The Traveller”: Methods of communi-
cation between railway passengers and the
train crew may be more reliable in Victoria
than N. S. Wales, but there is one important
part of railway equipment where the position
is reversed. In the Ma State all fixed sig-
nals have to be placed so that they will have
a sky background, if it is possible, when
viewed from an oncoming train. This is a
very great advantage in daylight, and even
at night it helps to eliminate the dangers of
conflicting lights from elsewhere. But in
Victoria this precaution is not observed. If
a sky background can’t be helped it is there,
but otherwise any old background does. In
fact the signals sometimes almost seem to
be camouflaged purposely, as though an
enemy train might arrive at any moment.
Very high signal-posts are sometimes re-
quired to overlook hills or other obscuring
scenery. But high posts are expensive, and
expense is anathema to Vic. railway manage-
men t. . A . ■

“Crojack”: The recently-reported collision
of the steamer Mamari with an iceberg near
Cape Horn recalls that in 1893 the ship
Wellington rammed an iceberg and almost
foundered when bound on the same track as
the Mamari. That was a supremely unlucky
voyage. The Wellington sailed from Picton
on a Friday, being towed to sea by the
steamer Penguin (afterwards lost in Cook’s
Strait with heavy loss of life). Terrific
storms were experienced from the outset and
a man was lost overboard. Off the Horn the
Wellington rammed ice and stove in her
bows. Two men were imprisoned by the
twisted iron, both being injured. They were
fed through the gaping holes in the twisted
bulkheads till they died and their bodies
were then dismembered from outside for
burial. After making Rio under jury rig the
Wellington was fired on by rebel warships.
Brazil being then in the throes of a revo-
lution.

“Amen”: Angus McCleanit had been
verger of an Adelaide suburban church for
many years when his wife passed away, and
he obtained permission to erect a mural
tablet to her memory directly over his
sanctum in the tabernacle. Being far-sighted,
he decided to kill two birds with one stone,
as it were, and so the tablet read: —
Sacred to the Memory
of
Angus McCleanit
who died
aged years
Verger of this church for years.
Also of
Martha, his wife,
who died August 23rd, 1901
aged 58 years.
Angus came of sturdy as well as thrifty
stock, and he succeeded in keeping the blanks
unfilled for so many years that the tablet
acquired an interest all its own.
“Roka”: A few weeks ago a
Sydney artist who usually
frames his own pictures sold a
large landscape still on the
easel, with the proviso that it
should appear for a month at a
local exhibition before it was
handed over. The purchaser
intimated his preference for “a
rough gold frame,” and the en-
terprising artist looked round
for something to constitute the
roughness. He decided on some
home-dried peas, and after liber-
ally sprinkling these on a
gummy surface gilded the whole
affair and sent the picture along
to the exhibition. Three weeks
later he received an agitated
telephone call from the exhibi-
tion authorities to come along
immediately and remove his
effort. Hastening in a be-
wildered mood to the gallery, he
found a curious crowd standing
before his picture, apparently
framed in emerald green. In
three weeks the peas had nearly
all sprouted, and the canvas was
surrounded with a forest of
waving tendrils.
“Amity”: The infant at the
bottom of our street won first
prize in a “Most Beautiful
Baby” competition the other
day. For all I know he may
have deserved it, but this was
how it was managed. His
photograph was duly sent in to
a city exhibition, each visitor
to which was handed a voting
ticket at the turnstile, directed
to the array of infantile pic-
tures and asked to record a
vote. Some people voted, others
cast their tickets upon the floor
or accepted them uninterestedly.
But the family which won the
palm attended that exhibition
every day; Mum and Auntie
stood in the photo gallery and
pointed out the charms of No.
11, two small girls were always
near the turnstile soliciting
votes and picking up discarded
tickets, and two small boys
scouted through the building
and trailed ticket-carriers. At
night Dad and Uncle did their
shift, and sometimes even
Grand-dad was impressed into
the service. Meanwhile the
family had scratch meals, the
children were away from school,
and the house was mostly chaos.
Certainly the baby won and its
pictures were in the paper, but
it seemed a fearful family up-
heaval for so little.
“O’Jones” : One of the griev-
ances against the missionaries
in the Solomons arose in the
early days of wireless. Planters
and others didn’t grudge the
men of God possession of luxur-
ious listening-in sets, but they
complained bitterly of the lack
of community spirit which led
to the withholding from the
news-starved lads of the results
of sporting events. I know a
man who travelled 80 miles by
launch to tap a mission-station
for the placed horses in the Mel-
bourne Cup, only to be rebuffed.
His opinion of missionaries dur-
ing the month he had to wait
for the 8.-P. steamer to bring
the news was expressed in the
most violent language. Now such
as he are installing their own sets,
and relations are more amicable.
“Paree” : Two more entries for the Queer
Deaths competition. In the awful storms
that swept over Northern Europe in mid-
July an old couple in London died in
their sleep because the gas-main had become
broken ; and a baby in Lambeth fell down-
stairs into the family dining-room—a raging
torrent at the moment —and was drowned.
In Paris (on the same day) occurred an
even stranger triple fatality. Two brother-
had stored 100,000 bananas in a cellar.
Flood-water set up fermentation. First one
partner went down to inspect, then the
other, then a boy to look for them. All
three were brought up, dead, by a rescue
party in gas-masks.

Memorial Shrine,’ Dr. Argyle said, ‘is that the rays

shrine.’ ” —Melbourne Sun.
The eager years come treading each on
each
And lives are marred and made, and men
forget
A blood-soaked poppy field, a stricken beach,
And little lonely crosses firmly set
Like victors’ pennants on a hard-won land.
Oh. palely shines the bravest distant, star —
And they, on half-remembered hill and stand,
Sleep far!
Since ever men in their unwisdom must
Forget their noblest gestures, and forego
The distant star-shine for the present dust,
Since drab to-days all yester-gleams out-
glow,
The greater glories come and dim and pass,
Are sung, and soon forgotten from our
song;
And they—these exiled dead —and they, alas!
Sleep long.
So long to sleep, to lie so far
afield —-
Dear God, they are no part
of that dull earth!
Some sunlit bushland to such
dead should yield
Their rest, as once it smiled
upon their birth.
So long to sleep. . . .yet raise
your symbol grey ;
’Tis something that a south-
ern sun will fold
In warm, white arms this
treasured stone —though
they
Sleep cold.

“G. City” : A Sydney medico married the
daughter of a family well known in one of
the smaller country districts where every-
body’s business is communal property. Two
sons appeared in reasonable sequence and
just lately a small daughter shuffled on to
this mortal coil. Wishing to convey the news
to his wife’s mother, but suspecting the
privacy of telegraph messages going through
the country office, the doctor craftily worded
his wire “Third edition out. Not a re-
print.”

“Kayeff”: A new and thoroughly ingeni-
ous method of obtaining a railway ride on
the never —“macing the rattler” in the Eng-
lish phrase of a generation ago—w r as
recently tried by two bright spirits on a
northern train. One rigged himself out in
a borrowed or stolen police uniform; the
other posed as the prisoner. An extra touch
of realism wms introduced by the handcuffs
being snapped on the captive before the

the bogus .John told the ticket-collector that
his prisoner, caught pocket-picking further
down the line, had escaped and jumped on
the moving train, and that he had followed
and apprehended him. The story was received
without suspicion, and the pair of cheerful
frauds passed through, ostensibly bound for
the local lock-up. At this point, however,
their luck broke down badly; the first man
(hey encountered outside the station was the
local sergeant. The upshot of it was that
they got some free board and lodging in addi-
tion to their free ride.

“Bullwhanger” : The house flags and funnel
marks of shipping companies, in either their
design or their lettering, seem to lend them-
selves to outrageous nicknames like the
“Hungry Goose” (B. 4/8/’27). Even in
modern ships where the unions and the Boai-d
of Trade take good care that tucker is plen-
tiful it is the same. Thus the Shaw, Savill
and Albion line are genially known in the
fo'c’s'le as “Slow Starvation and Agony.”
The double II of Hogarth’s flag means “Hard-
ship and Hunger” to .lack, and the same
letter painted in glaring white on the black
funnels of (lie Ilain ships does for either.
Every company has a nickname, and even the
coastal concerns are not exempt. The Illa-
warra and South Coast S- X. Co. are never
referred to as anything but the “Pig and
Whistle” on the Sydney waterfront.
“Lee Brace”: The Canadian Government
merchant marine, which used to fly as its
house-flag a pennant adorned with a beaver
rampant, was unkindly known as the
“Hungry Rat.” When on my first visit to
Vancouver some years ago I saw a ship of
the venerable Hudson Bay Company flying
a house flag with the monogram 11.8. C. Not
recognising it, I asked a longshoreman what
it stood for. “Here Before Christ” he told
me unsmilingly.

“Skeeter”: He isn't our town-crier (B.
18/8/’27), except unofficially; his actual
occupation is the removal of garbage, but
as he goes the rounds with his dray he likes
to retail the latest news. It isn’t, confined
to public affairs either. Somebody asked him
the other morning if it was true that his
wife (his third venture) was leaving him.
and he admitted it bitterly. "She got narked
with wot I said to ’er,” he added. Inevitably
there were further queries. “Well,” he
boomed, “all I said was, ‘Come on, Mary, an’
take ycr ’idin’ like a woman.’ ”

“Sploge”: When I was a kid my dad
used to tell of a night-watchman who pur-
sued his calling at Araluen (N.S.W.) in the
’seventies. One midnight he varied his slogan
thus: “Twelve o’clock an’ all’s well an’ the
chicory mill’s on fire.”
* * * *
“Fez”: Speaking of town-criers (B.
18/8/'27). I can remember when my birth-
place was invaded by a large number of
school-teachers brought thither by the
annual examinations. One of them who was
never identified gave the crier a couple of
shillings to announce that a certain well-
known pedagogue would like to meet a nice
young lady to take to the pictures. The
crying of this message helped to brighten
our existence for the rest of that week.
THE LOWER MATHEMATICS.
“But, my dear girl, I haven’t the means to keep you. Why, your father told me that
it takes as much to keep you going as it does your mother and himself together!”
“Well, darling, doesn’t that just prove that two can live more cheaply than one?”
“Arthur R.”: The old Rotomahana, which
doubled with the Loongana in a bi-weekly
trip across Bass Strait, is now in the hands
of the ship-breakers. Her plates showed little
signs of the tremendous buffetings to which
she was subjected during her life, and so
good is the steel of which she was con-
structed that many of the seasoned plates
have been shipped to Sheffield to be turned
into high-grade razors.

“Syd Swagman”: The latest penological
development is reported from Stewart’s
Creek (N.Q.), where the warders complain
that their pay-sheets are made up by a
long-term prisoner, and even the roster is
arranged and the warders allotted their shifts
by the same man. One warder who was
recently called to the prisoner’s desk in order
to have a new shift allotted him protested
to his union organiser that he “had to keep
sweet” with the convict, or else risk being
put on a bad shift.
# # * *
“Borom”: A more diabolical weapon than
the razor (B. 11/8/’27) came to light in the
accident department of a big Sydney hos-
pital recently. It was a piece of thin steel
rod. about 15 inches long, sharpened to
almost a needle-point, with the other end
bent round in a loop to serve as a handle.
An inch or so from the sharpened end there
was a fine slit in which a safety-razor blade
had been inserted with about a quarter-inch
of its edge protruding from each side, thin
wire holding it firmly in position. The pre-
sumption is that the operator first jabs his
victim and then twdsts the instrument in
the wound, producing a fearful injury. Like
most exotic weapons of the kind, this one
was found in the possession of a foreigner
from one of the Mediterranean countries.
* * * *
“Basra”: Public executions may have a
salutary effect on the natives of Papua (B.
11/8/’27), but they had little, if any, deterrent
value in Mesopotamia during the war. The
Irabs of the marshes between the Tigris
and Euphrates regarded it as their tradi-
tional right to prey upon the flanks of the
armies which were using their country as a
battlefield. Persistently they murdered and
looted the wounded, stripped the dead, stole
and sniped. When a murderer was caught,
which was seldom, lie was hanged in public
outside the nearest town or village to discour-
age the others. Usually the gallows were
quite open so that the whole gruesome busi-
ness could be plainly seen, but at Amara (a
particularly troublesome place) a canvas
screen hid the final. Generally the whole male
population, with a fair sprinkling of females,
turned out to see the execution. A military
guard with fixed bayonets stood in a circle
round the gallows facing the mob, which was
usually hostile and sullen. The victim in-
variably showed stoical indifference to his
fate. The crowd would disperse when the
show was over with many mutterings, and
after a few days the sniping and looting
would recommence. Apparently the Arabs
regarded the penalty as part of the game.

“X.N.0.”: Joseph Conrad could never
have served in the R.N. Therefore he could
have no first-hand knowledge of the naval
signal-book, or he would never have made the
statement that it contains the signal “Well
done” (B. 11/8/’27). His ignorance of it
is further shown when he says the signal
consists of “those two simple words followed
by the name of the ship.” Obviously he was
misled by the “Well done, Condor” tradition,
which message, as sent, read literally “Con-
dor, manoeuvre well executed,” the name of
the ship addressed always coming first in
every naval flag signal. Even in the service
the phrase may be colloquially translated as
“Well done,” but it isn’t in the book.

“Miro” : Maoriland is seriously taking up
the project of a trans-Tasman flight, the
idea being to keep the matter if possible in
the hands of the Dominion’s aviators. The
Government, appealed to for a financial hand,
has announced that if the project is financed
by public subscription it will take over the
machine used at four-fifths of its original
cost. Vickers, Eiimted. have submitted a
quotation of £BO5O for a suitable ’bus with
a maximum cruising distance of 1600 miles.
Compared with the amount assessed as the
cost of the Australian trans-Pacific hop the
Maoriland venture looks expensive.

“Medicurse”: A two-inch pin, accidentally
swallowed, was extracted from the bronchial
tube of a patient in a Sydney hospital last
week. The strangest case of this sort I
remember was when an inmate of a lunatic
asylum was brought into Prince Alfred Hos-
pital with an abscess in the groin ; and the
X-ray examination showed a dinner-fork re-
posing in his stomach. How he ever managed
to get the thing down must always remain
a mystery. The deep corrosions found on
the fork when it was retrieved indicated
that it had been there for a long time. The
first indication was the abscess.

"It is,” I said to her, ‘‘the time of lamb-

And daffodils in sheath.
Of violets in the mead and timid daisies
Out on the dewy heath.”
She merely said, "I wonder if the baby
Is cutting his back teeth?”
"The skies are blue,” I urged, “the shining

Are pressed by feet of spring.
High in the vault where fleecy clouds are
drifting
I hear a sweet lark sing.
"I'll tell that shop,” she said, “that their

Too dear for anything.”
“The whole world wakes,” 1 said, “to keep

Of chilly winter's rout.
The lovely tokens of the old earth's quicken-

Are scattered all about."
“Next week,” she said, “I’ll try to give this

A really good turn-out."
"Look how the poppies Hare down in the

A change is taking place
in the Automotive Industry
WITHIN the past few years
public demand turned the tide
from high-pressure to balloon tyres
—from two-wheel to four-wheel
brakes —from five to seven-bearing
crankshafts.
Now experienced motorists demand
a better type of power plant with
freedom from valve and carbon
annoyance and less mechanical
trouble —a type of motor that is
quiet and stays quiet after many
thousands of miles. They want
unusual performance and activity in
a motor plant that will maintain its
efficiency indefinitely.
The Knight sleeve-valve engine,
long used in many of the finest cars
of Europe and America, is recog-
nised as the superior and ultimate
type of motor by both European and
American automotive engineers, be-
cause it has the qualities which
motorists so need.
The Falcon-Knight is the first
Knight-engined car in the lower-
price range.

Down to about 10 years ago liquidation was
an important part of the programme; since
then expansion has been rapid, and it has
not stopped yet. The bank does business
in all the Australian States and Maori-
land, and a comparison of the last quarterly
returns with those of seven years ago shows
that the progress has been pretty evenly
spread over the map. In 1920 paid capital,
stood at £2,213,009, and visible reserves
were a mere £16,258. The position inside
had, however, received careful attention, and
the time for profit-dividing was at hand. On
the strength of prospects the board was able
to issue 249,613 new 10s. ords. at 100 p.c.
premium in November, 1921. Since then
development has been so rapid that new
share issues have been almost an annual
occurrence: 1922, 252,025; 1923, 457.394;
1925, 457,394; 1926, 382,158; 1927, 500,000
—all at 100 p.c. premium. The lot made
paid capital £3,299,050 at June 30, and
there was £136,600 still to come in on the
last issue. The premiums received total
£1,086,040, which, in addition to being a
very handsome contribution to reserves, also
mean that the new capital is costing the
bank only 71 p.c. Another factor which
helps to make the 15 p.c. div. to the
ords. an easy matter is the £2,117,350 of
4 p.c. pref. capital, which represents part
of the old bank’s debt to depositors. Actu-
ally the £341.711 visibly netted last year was
equal to only 10.9 p.c. on average capital.
But after allowing for the pref. require-
ments (£84,694) and the £25,000 struck off
premises, the balance (£232,017) was equal
to 23.2 p.c. on the average ordinary capital
employed.
Gross profits and exes, have moved in this
way :

*Less taxes and provision for contingencies.
Exes, ate up 65.5 p.c. of gross profit, last
year compared with 64.9. 64.8, 65.3 and 65.3
p.c. back to 1923. The improvement in
gross profit since 1918 is even better than
the figures in the table suggest, for taxation
now takes a much bigger bite than it did
nine years ago.
Balance-sheet figures show that the man-
agement has lost none of its vigor:—

Premises . . 499,095 689,060 746,760
The jump in the note circulation is. due to
the steady expansion of the co.’s business in
Maoriland. The £1147,361 increase in bills
payable, etc., is a healthy sign, but the
movement in deposits was very sluggish. On
the other hand advances stepped forward
briskly and were equal to 87.1 p.c. of de-
posits compared with 78.6 p.c. in 1926.
When the books closed the bank was holding
only £4 18s. lid. of the public’s money for
each £1 of its own, and of every £1 of out-
side debt there was 7s. 6d. liquid. In
spite of its hurry onward the C.B.A. is
thus keeping its position snug enough. The
market discounts the future and pays 31s.
for the fully-paid ords.; the immediate re-
turn to the investor at that figure is a shade
under 5 p.c. p.a. on the basis of the present
div. Yet he would be a sanguine man who
would expect an early increase in either
bank profits or bank dividends; and new
capital issues are not likely to be half as
numerous during the next few years as they
have been latterly. And when the C.B.A.
has made a new issue there hasn’t been any-
thing great in it for shareholders, as you
can see from the foregoing figures relating
to premiums charged.

Keen competition and heavy overhead exes,
ate so deeply into last year’s earnings
that net profit dropped £30,124, and the div.
was reduced to 10 p.c. In the previous year
174 p.c. and a one-in-ten bonus issue was
handed out. Before setting aside £65,178
for taxation and depreciation operating pro-
fits were £134,128 in 1926, but that result
was won when the co. had an almost open
field. Last year’s trading profits were
£121,249 after providing for taxation, and
£50,164 was earmarked for depreciation.
During the year 110 new cabs were added
to the fleet, bringing the total to 248 cabs
in Melbourne and 254 in Sydney, and an
extra 3d. was tacked on to the Sydney fares
in July, 1926. The 44-liour week, Workers’
. Compensation and increased wages added
upwards of £32.000 to the year's operating
costs, the chairman says, and the N. S.
Wales Child Endowment law is expected 1o
tack another £5OOO p.a. on the wages bill.
For the first time depreciation has been
set against the assets concerned and a
general reserve of £25,000 disclosed. But the
latter does not mean as much as it should,
for it is in cabs, etc. Cabs, cars, trucks and
taximeters are in at cost £379,383, less
£131,427 written off; garage equipment, etc.,
at cost, £23,91.8, less £7042 written off. But
tyres, batteries, uniforms, etc., which depre-
ciate very quickly, are shown at valuation,
£10,605, and much depends upon the figure
at which they were written. However, cabs and
equipment are wearing so well, the chairman
says, that the board might take a less con-
servative view of depreciation during the
current year; a year ago depreciation was
said to be on the basis of less than half the
estimated life (400,000 miles) per cab. The
average net earnings per cab cannot be
ascertained definitely, but they were cer-
tainly less than in the previous year; and
future results will largely depend upon over-
head, competition and the public’s ability to
spend.

During the year £98,710 of capital came
in; £17,195 was clipped off the overdraft,
which has been reduced to £7OOO since the
close of the accounts; and trade creditors
■were £61,769 lower. On the other side cabs,
tyres, garage equipment, etc., increased
£96,562 and another £16,437 went into
stocks. The co. sold its Exhibition-street
and Toorak-rotid (Melbourne) freeholds
during the year, and £24,000, subject to
a mortgage of £lO,OOO, was owing on the
deal when the books closed. The sale prac-
tically set off the moneys expended during
the year in completing the Malvern and
N. Sydney depots.
Paid capital was £401,194 at June 30. A
10 p.c. div. on that would call for practi-
cally the whole of last year’s net trading-
profit. There has been heavy dealing in
the scrip, which made a spectacular rise
to 625. Od. in April last year. Since July,
1926, the price has fluctuated from 425. 6d. to
recent sales at 17s. 6d. The market
is taking a gloomier view of nearly
everything; there is nothing like a “No”
spoken decisively by a chorus of bank
managers to get the public’s tail down.
Naturally, it doesn’t believe there will be
so much money thrown around in taxi-hire
and waiting time; and there is consequently
a pretty wide suspicion about the main-
tenance of the 10 p.c. div.

The co. has a very well equipped mine, one
of the best bunkering connections in the
Commonwealth, a fleet of steam colliers in
good condition and a careful management.
Good profits can therefore be expected, indus-
trial conditions permitting. Hence last year’s
recovery in net earnings and the restoration
of the 10 p.c. div. The year’s net profit
was equal to 14 p.c. on paid capital com-
pared with 10.2, 14 and 13.8 p.c. for the
three preceding years; and, as usual, there
was a good margin between earnings and
distributions. The co. took over the South
Bulli from Ebenezer Vickery about 27 years
ago, won good profits, paid some handsome
divs., but never failed to cut the rate of
distribution in order to make ample pro-
vision for reserves. One result has been that
over the last 20 years £175.000 has been
handed out in bonus scrip—1908, £25,000;
1913, £150,000 —thus bringing paid capital
to its present figure, £400,000. A recon-
struction, a little over four years ago, was
on a share-for-share basis 'plus a cash pay-
ment of 12s. Od. per share.

With sundry creditors is lumped “provision
for taxation, etc.” Also the grouping of
stocks and investments with the mine, jettv,
railway and rolling stock,- plant, freehold,
steamers, hulks, stores, etc., obscures the
real position, liquid and otherwise. The
amount set aside for depreciation is not dis-
closed, but it may be taken for granted that
the provision has been ample. A year ago
the sinking of a new ventilating shaft was com-
menced, and that usually means development
underground. Last year a good deal of
money was spent on the fleet, and the mine
and equipment were not neglected, either;
and the co. has not had to go into debt to
do it. From this one may conclude that the
old conservative policy is being continued.
On the other hand the effect of oil-fired
and motor-driven vessels upon the future
of the coal-bunkering trade is one of the
things the investor has to keep in mind.
For the scrip, which has a net tangible
backing of 235. 3d. per share, 245. is offered.
At that figure the return is p.c. p.a. on a
10 p.c. div. But where mines” are concerned
net tangibles don’t always mean much. The
assets can be touched all right, but it
would often cost as much as they were
worth to shift them.

When this co. amalgamated the businesses
of Bennett and Fisher and Clieadle, Crase
and Co. in 1919, the management set to
work to expand the old connections, and
with the help of a long run of good seasons
the figures have moved in fine style. Paid
capital was £238,370 in 1921; an issue of
150,000 £1 71 p.c. cum. prefs. in 1925
brought the figure to £450,000; last year
the issue of 150 000 £1 71 p.c. cum. prefs.,
ranking after the first lot, carried capital
to £600,000. The past season’s clip sold
freely at profitable prices, the carryover was
small and the new money was at work for
most of the term. The result was an expan-
sion of £27,038 to £146,482 in gross profits
compared with a growth of £6431 in the
previous year. Exes., however, moved up
£18.012, leaving a net improvement of only
£9026. An encouraging feature was that
administrative exes, ate up only 55 p.c. of
income compared with 57. 1 p.c. in 1926:
but a bigger allowance for depreciation and
taxation brought total exes, to 66.6 p.c. of
income, the same as in the previous year.
The net earning power of average capital
was 8.5 p.c. last year compared with 8.8,
12.2, 11.8 and 9.7 p.c. back to 1923. It
should be remembered, however, that the
1924 and 1925 figures were largely the
result of extraordinary prices for wool.
Considering the smallness of reserves
they are only £8264 in excess of the £30,777
of intangibles—and taking into view ’ the
extreme possibility of a change from recent
semi-boom conditions, the dividend policy has
been excessively liberal. More than 90 p.c.
of lost year’s net profit was handed to
shareholders, and margins have not been
improving over the past four years.
Here are balance-sheet figures:—
1922. • 1926. 1927.
Paid capital .. .. £239,828 £450,000 £6OO 000
Liabilities .. . . 225,276 349,953 360,090
Freehold, plant, stock, etc. 65,517 84,523 108,102
Advances . . .. 382,380 733,011 876,771
Cash and investments.. 15,011 18,230
Outsiders have a fairly substantial interest
in the business; they had 11s. 3d. at risk
for every £1 owned by shareholders at June
30. During the year £10,137 was added to
the outside debt. Freehold, plant, etc., was
£23,579 greater. Nearly all the new capital
that came in went to finance clients; ad-
vances, etc., moved up £143,760 to £876.771.
The latter figure was written after bad and
doubtful debts and contingencies had been
provided for, and much depends just now
upon whether the provisions are sufficient.
All that can be said definitely on that point
is that the co. lias a board which knows
the risks. Prices for the current season pro-
mise to be favorable; but final figures
depend upon rainfall, and conditions
throughout most of S. Aus. and the West
Darling are dry.
At the close of the accounts the A prefs.
had a net tangible backing of £4 Is. Id. per
fully-paid share, and there was £3 Is. Id.
for the B prefs. The market values the
A’s at 20s. 3d. and the B’s at 19s. 4d. For
the ords., with a net tangible backing of
20s. 6d., 18s. 4d. was recently paid, giving
the investor a return of 8.7 p.c. p'.a. as long
as the 8 p.c. div. continues.

Paid capital and outside debt have grown
so steadily during the last eight years that
the margin between net earnings and the
12J p.c. distributions became uncomfortably
narrow a couple of years ago. But the
position is a shade better; net profit was 13.1
p.c. of paid capital last year, compared with
12.7, 12.5 and 13.9 p.c. back to 1924. Income
grew £lOlO last year and exes, expanded
only £179, thus leaving a net increase of
£B3l. Yet the div. still called for a shade
over 95 p.c. of the net profit, and the balance
(£1570) advanced the reserves to no more
than £42,750. equal to only 17 p.c. of paid
capital. Balance-sheet figures have grown
in this way :
1920. 1926. 1927.
Paid capital .. .. £147,245 £250,000 £250,000
Liabilities .. .. 3,163 78,605 83,794

300,000 £1 shares and there is £50,000 at
call on one-third of them. But the market,
which is apparently prepared to wait for
benefits, looks at the long run of good divs.
and the steady growffh in earnings, and values
the scrip on a 6 p.c. basis. The net tangible
backing is 235. 4d. per fully-paid share —
plus whatever more the freehold is worth
than the accounts claim.

The Broken Hill Prop, no longer tells us
what its ore is worth. For three years,
1021-24, the mine was closed down; there
had been a strike and it wasn’t thought
worth while reopening it. Since then, thanks
to the great prices for all three of the co.’s
metals, managing-director Lewis has gone
hard while the going was good. Last year
(to May 31, 1927) 178,887 tons of ore was
drawn from the old mine, and for the three
years 461,527 tons. But with the cumulative
falls in metal prices that part of the co.’s
operations must be close to the bread-line
now. And there is no chance to do much
picking and choosing of ore. What is left
nobody knows; all that is known is that
prospecting hasn’t unearthed anything for a
year past; and the outlying Potosi mine,
which was drawn on while prices w T ere high,
has been shut down.
The co. long since ceased to regard the
Broken Hill mine as anything but a side-
line, profitable only under first-rate condi-
tions. The steelworks are the real support
these days. The mine now represents only
£70,405 of the capital, and the plant and
machinery £35,984; the total share capital
is £2.687,708 plus £1,383,105 of premiums,
the debentures outstanding total £1,795,905
and the formal reserve fund is a million and
a half. Including stocks and everything
else the co. has something like 81 millions in
the iron and steel business, and its opera-
tions have led to probably another five mil-
lions being put into direct subsidiary
industries. Net profit for the year was
£291,577, after allowing for depreciation run-
ning to £318.979. The year’s production
totalled £4,657,004; so the net profit was a
shade over 6 p.c. on turnover. An increase
of 7 p.c. in outgoings (exclusive of dividends
and interest on debentures) would extin-
guish the net profit. And when net profit
is extinguished it isn’t long before the indus-
try is extinguished. Politicians who cheer-
fully clap on 3 p.c. to wages and salaries
bills as though it was a matter of no conse-
quence might profitably spend an hour with
the accounts of this most important of Aus-
tralian industrial companies.

South Lucknow (N.S.W.) sends this: —
The arrangements for sending ore to Germany (B.
21/7/’27) are still incomplete. The third parcel of
ore was treated locally for 4.210 z. gold per ton.
The three parcels to date weighed 12 tons, total
yield being 550 z. gold. Reminder of winze ore, about
60 tons, would require battery treatment on the
spot. The fourth parcel should be despatched in a
couple of weeks.

After some years of fluctuating fortunes —
really bright prospects and then the
reverse —the Ravenswood G. M. Co. (N.Q.)
has abandoned the Duke mine and leased it
to its late employees. Usually a deal of
this kind foreshadows early abandonment.
The Duke has been exceptionally rich —20oz.
ore was not uncommon, and there was often
enough of this grade to bag separately. But
fluctuating size of reef and inordinately high
costs have handicapped it. The co.’s. last
crushing was 73 tons, worth £l3 a ton, but
even then it endured a loss. The small
reserve of cash, built up out of mine pro-
ceeds. has been all lost during the past 12
months’ operations. If the co. can raise
further capital it may re-open No. 4 Sunset,
but much depends on present prospecting
operations in Sunset 5, where a 14in. reef
showing free gold has recently been struck.
This line was abandoned by Laurence Wilson
nearly 20 years ago.

Queensland Mines Department certainly
can’t be accused of neglecting investigation
of any possible indications of petroleum. Oil-
geologist L. C. Ball is doing all the work, and
has be *n indefatigable in his research during
several years past on evidences in artesian
bores over the wide expanse of the Queens-
land basin. His report on the Kaywanna
Trust bore, on the Goondiwindi line, recently
examined, indicates the presence of a heavy
oil and is the most noteworthy record since
that of the Longreach shire bore. The Kay-
wanna driller recorded oily scums at 32 1 3
feet, and Ball confirms this occurrence. He
reports, further, one sample containing as
much as 74 per cent, of a heavy oil, and also
spots of oil escaping with the sludge, accom-
panied by emission of inflammable gas. The
latter, however, is mainly methane (CH4),
which is rather a pity. A wet gas plus 74
p.c. oil would have created some excitement.
Reading between the lines, Ball evidently
thinks it a natural oil, but with Scotch
caution leaves it at an assumption until
further evidence is forthcoming. It is in-
tended to try to raise capital to drill a dry
hole, and it is hoped in that event to secure
a Federal subsidy to help the work along.

Great Boulder struggles on. No divs.
have been paid since 1923, and last year
for the first time a loss was
reached as high as £11.020 compared with
the trifling profit of £2244 for the previous
12 months. It is a sad come-down for a
co. which for 15 years (1903-17) returned
to shareholders over a quarter of a million
per annum in divs. Ore in sight is esti-
mated at 63,224 tons, but the grade, a shade
over 94dwt., is barely payable under present
working conditions. The co. is making an
experimental attempt to carry on with the
aid of tributors working on a “no profit no
royalty” system, and is said to be well satis-
fied with results.

Minister for Mines Munsie (W.A.) has
been yelling from the housetops what he
thinks of the Sons of Gwalia board. Recently
he offered Gwalia substantial financial help
provided it raised more capital for develop-
ment. The board, however, declined to aban-
don its scuttle-and-get policy unless the
State found all the money required for
development, took all the risk and made it-
self solely responsible for any loss. Munsie
now threatens to introduce legislation, giving
the Government power, when satisfied that
a mine is not being properly worked and
developed, to step in and take possession.
The position he reckons calls for drastic
action, as there is, he alleges, 10 years of
profitable life ahead of the mine if worked
properly and barely two if salvaged. There
is no question about many mining cos. being
ill managed in their clays of prosperity; but
a provision requiring a percentage of the
profits to be put into trustee securities would
serve practical purposes better than a pro-
vision empowering the State to “step in and
take possession.” For, of course, “the State”
really means one political party in a State;
and there is great danger in that.
* * * *
Another of Westralia’s oil hopes has been
blasted. Some time ago reports reached Perth
that oceans of petroleum existed in the
vicinity of Cheyne beach and that the con-
cession-holders were besieged with option-
seekers. Finally the Mines Department sent
an expert along. “I cannot take an optimistic
view of the likelihood of mineral oil being
found on the area under review,” he wrote.

The Hoskins people of Lithgow (N.S.W.)
are preparing to work the big high-grade,
iron deposits which they recently acquired
at Yampi Sound (W.A.). Two cos. with
high-sounding names were formed some time
ago for the purpose of converting other iron
deposits in the same locality “into a com-
mercial product,” but nothing has been heard
of them lately.

McCahon’s Gold Mines (W.A.) —a venture
which was floated and came to grief during
the 1920 Hampton boom and which has been
unlucky ever since—has taken an option on
a show at Westonia. Crushings are said
to be good and the ore in sight splendid; but
what has to be proved is whether the new
acquisition will stand up to the pick for any
length of time.

Boulder No. 1 mine, surrendered by the
ill-fated Boulder No. 1 some years ago,
has a chance of becoming a fair gold pro-
ducer. Latterly a local syndicate has been
doing well and has partly opened up a fair-
sized shoot which is said to have every
appearance of permanency. Meanwhile Boul-
der No. 1, which abandoned this property
to look for something better, is out of busi-
ness and on the brink of bankruptcy.

Re the paragrnnh about Kampar River (B.
18/8/’27), Rex Thompson writes:—
I was not a director of Kampar River when the
sale was made to the London co. which subsequently
completed the purchase of the property and floated
the new co. Bayas Tujoh property is approximately
eight miles from Kampar River property; this pro-
perty was offered only to Thotno and not previously
to other people, and has no connection with Kampar
River Co. in any way.
The directors of Tliomo and Tujoh on the
same subject:—
Statement concerning association of Kampar River.
Thomo and Tujoh (B. 18/8/’27) is wholly untrue.
The property floated by Thomo as Tujoh has no
connection with Kampar River. No part of the old
Kampar River property is within the boundaries of
Tujoh.

Bulolo Gold Mines, an Adelaide flotation,
registered September, 1926, has just issued
its report to June 30 last. So far nothing
seems to have been done beyond pegging
and applying for five dredging and sluicing
leases on the Bulolo River, and a mining
lease. Nominal capital is £60,000, £37,551.
of it called, expeditionary and flotation ex-
penses took £16.843, and there is a cash
balance of £5437. The co. now desires
to institute an aeroplane service, and is
looking into shareholders’ pockets. On such
matters as whether prospecting or develop-
ment justify this calling for more capital
the report is delightfully vague. People
will begin to say soon that these New
Guinea cos. dare not get down to tin tacks.

Puchong Tin, near Selangor (F.M.S.),
appeared under Austral Malay’s wing in
December, 1923. A bucket dredge,_ electric-
ally operated and fitted with sluices, has
been ordered in Scotland, and will cost
£72,800. Capacity will be 190,000 cubic
yards per month. The dredge is to be ready
tor shipment in nine months from August 1,
which means a long wait yet before digging
begins. The co.’s c; pital is £250,000 in £1
shares. Of these 42,000 were issued as
f.p., 19,900 going to vendors and Austral
Malay retaining the balance, the co. getting,
in addition, £28,000 in cash. There were
108.000 contribs. paid to 7s. and 100,000 are
held in reserve. The total area is about
1026 acres. Boring averages for 277 selected
acres showed .5761 b. of 72 p.c. tin oxide to
the yard, and an estimated 26.300,000 yards.
Wash is easy but with a 30ft. overburden,
and average depth is 59 feet, with the bot-
tom undulating limestone in places, though
mostly soft slate.

Malayan-Siamese tin returns for the first
half of August show Ivampong Kamunting,
Austral Malay’s 14-year-old offspring, main-
taining its average with a fraction over
lOoz. to the c.y. (27 tons oxide) from
04,000 yards turned over by the two dredges.
Austral' Malay’s other subsidiaries include
Asam, whose 15.5 tons from 41,000 yards
is 114 tons poorer than the output for
the same period of July; but 14,000 yards
less were handled. 41 lu Yam, with 224
tons from 52,000 yards, improves on the
July averages; and Thabawleik landed 30
tons from 40,000 yards, as against 21 tons
from 32,000 yards in July. Larut’s 44
tons from 164,000 yards does not measure
up to the wliole-of-July harvest of 102 tons.
Malim Nawar’s 12 tons from 48,(MX) yards
is better, but M. N. South slipped. Kun-
dang’s yield. 15 tons from 50,000 yards, is
neck-and-neck with its July performance.
Kuala Karnpar, closed down for repairs on
July 23 and resuming on August 11. re-
turned 2 tons for the 25 hours worked.
Ronpibon (lOf tons from 40,000 yards)
keeps steady. Ronpibon Extended’s old and
small dredge dug only four tons, with the
report mercifully reticent as to hours worked
and ground turned over. Takuapa, after a
glorious burst in July, when 57 tons were
reported as won from 120.000 yards, is
running late—ls tons from 56,000 c.y. for
the half-month. The dredge, which had to
be shifted into the river earlier in the year,
is now about due to work its way back, and
this may mean a lot of dead horse.

Malay Siamese, the Sydney prospecting
and holding concern which has A. J. King
for its chairman, announces that financial
arrangements have been made for all the
co.’s subsidiaries. These are Haad Yai and
Phin Soon ; and the co.’s interests are identi-
cal with those of Nawng Pet and Huey Yot.
To these has been added Nai Hoot. As to
Phin Soon, capital has been obtained to
provide the equipment designed by superin-
tending-engineer Seale. The Malay Siamese
system has been to acquire properties that
needed a hand. Some of them are proved
sound propositions; others may be.
* * * *
Ratrut Basin, the old Malaya Corporation
show which had its beginnings in 1914, has
got consent from its shareholders to increase
capital from £250,000 to £280,000, by creat-
ing 30,000 new shares at £1 each at a ss.
premium. The original ground having been
about worked out, the plant, consisting of
an 11-year-old dredge, is being moved to a
new property on Sichon, in Southern Siam,
where a modern dredge, now building, is to
be also installed. The co. is finding the
shift and accessories much more expensive
than it had reckoned on. Hence the asked-
for increase. An interesting feature of the
shareholders’ meeting was the assurance of
chairman C. PI. Kerry that the stockholders
would receive the premium on shares in divi-
dends. Presumably this refers to an earlier
statement that the co. would go on paying
6d. dividends till the No. 1 dredge gets busy.

“F.C.A.” : According to local tradition, the
first place where gold was found in W.A. was
at Peterwongie, about 100 miles due east of
Geraldton. My brother got a ’weight or so
from the original digger, a blacksmith in
that town, after the sale of the Mainland
Consols. My brother and two more then
backed another brother and myself to _ pro-
spect for the mother lode. We loamed it up
the gully for three-quarters of a mile and
half-way up Peterwongie Hill, a mass of
broken thorite. As we had to pack the loam
a mile or more on a pony to the camp spring,
progress was slow and we got tired of it;
so my brother decided to sink about where
the colors ran out. That was slower still,
as the ground was hard, as I was bracenian
I scouted round between times and located a
small reef rich in mica and hornblende. This
on dollying gave a metal the color of silver
about as malleable as gold and exactly like
it in the stone except in color. With my
brother it had to bo gold, so nothing was done
with it. and. the grub-stake running out, we
left. I am .‘5O-odd years older now and would
give something for the chance again, if only
to fir.d out what the white metal was. It
may have been platinum.

Next week’s Bulletin will be a “Hop”
Memorial number. The best-known of the
great cartoonist's drawings will be repro-
duced —among them the three that “Hop”
himself lately said he remembered with most
pleasure: “I Thought I Had a Stamp,”
“The Roll Call” and the drawing published
on the death of Henry Pai’kes. Other poli-
tical notabilities featured include George
Dibbs and George Reid. But most of the
reproductions will be those quaintly-liumor-
ous masterpieces, without any political
flavor at all, in which “Hop” was inimitable.
Arthur Eedy succeeds his friend John
Garvan as managing director of the M.L.C.
They were in the office together as youngsters,
and when John became managing director
Arthur became general secretary, and the
two have been about as close as two men
ever get—it was never possible to say where
one man’s job ended and the other’s began.
Hence, except that other officers move up one,
probably nobody will notice that anything
has happened. Eedy, like Garvan, was a
High School boy, and got his first job with the
Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. in 1887: the
staff numbered less than half a dozen, and on
the first day the young cadet went to get his
lessons in actuarial science he was told that
the office he had joined would last four
years. He remembers wondering whether it
would last long enough in the fourth year to
pay him the £lOO it had promised him in
hi. s- fourth year. James Ashton will he
chairman of the co.; and the name of Garvan
will not be lost in the establishment be-
cause Din, John’s younger brother, will
rejoin the board, from which he retired some
years ago.
The tree under which Big John Forrest
camped at Oodnadatta in 1874 when return-
ing from one of his exploring expeditions
will be preserved if Premier Butler acts on
Basedow’s suggestion in the Assembly. A
big gum in the great spaces would make
a monument to the Big Australian more
fitting than chiselled stone or sculptured
marble.
“D.D.”: I believe Philip Charley (B.
11/8/’27) and George Lind are the sole
survivors of the original Broken Hill syndi-
cate of seven—Rasp, McCulloch, Urquhart,
Lind, Charley, James and Poole. All worked
on Mount Gipps station. Lind sold out
early and finished his days in a Melbourne
office. Urquhart sold for a song to Sam
Hawkins, the station carpenter, and I have
no record of him now. Rasp died in Adelaide,
McCulloch in Scotland, James in South Aus.
a couple of years back. Poole sold out well;
I last heard of him at the Burra (S.A.)
some dozen years ago. Philip Charley
was 14 when he commenced jaekerooing on
Mount Gipps—he had been sent to that
dry climate because of ill health. Bowes
Kelly paid £l5O for a fourteenth share,
which Sid Kidman had got from Poole anu
James in exchage for working bullocks. Sid
thought he had made a rare bargain in
unloading that fourteenth. Of the syndicate
of 14 which grew out of the station syndi-
cate of seven I know of only three who are
now living. Philip Charley. Bowes Kelly
and A. Cox, the last an English visitor.
“Silent Fell” was Birdwood’s title for John
Simnson Fell victim of the recent exDlosion
oimpson n eii, vicom or uie leceiu explosion
at his fathers Clyde oil refinery. A hue
swimmer and athlete genera.ly, he was re-
peatedly rejected for enlistment at the out-
break of war. He had to be content with
less martial activities, and served as Assist-
ant-Commissioner of the War Chest Fund,
Later when the tests were less severe he
enlisted in the Third Engineers and, declining
a commission, served as a sapper in France

Dave Drummond, newly-elected president
of the N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers’ Associa-
tion, was born at Leichhardt (Sydney), cdu-
cated at Scots’ College and originally intended
for commercial life. But the land held greater
attractions. He gained farming experience
in the New England and is now share-
farming at Oakwood. in the Inverell district,
Country-party member for Northern Table-
lands since 1920, he is seeking re-election
at Armidale.
"HOP" (LIVINGSTON HOPKINS), died August. 21, aged 81. The picture is
reproduced from a portrait painted, last year by his old friend and colleague
William Macleod.
The death of Helen Dow recalls a story
regarding her late dad, beside whom she
now lies in Brighton (Vic.) cemetery. Dow
was hon. sec. of the Melbourne Institute of
Journalists when that body. entertained
Mark Twain at a smoke night at the Cathe-
dra] Hotel. Put up to propose the guest’s
health, Dow said that it was Twain’s refer-
ences to agriculture that impelled him to
leave off minding sheep and come to the
city to edit the agricultural pages of the
Leader. Mark drawled that he had never
felt so flattered. He was overwhelmed at
the good turn he had unwittingly done not
only Dow but the sheep Dow was supposed
to have minded.
James Stopford, Queensland’s Plome Sec-
retary, who attended the Sydney conference
of those interested in keeping _ the Mount
Morgan mine alive, has a special personal
interest in the result; he is member for “Ihe
Mount,” and with its closing many of his
electors will trek elsewhere. He is a brother
of Dr. R. Stopford, who was tor
Balmain (N.S.W.) at the 1920 state
elections.
T. Caradoe Kerry, who was the first man
to hoist the British flag in New Guinea (a
feat which the Colonial Office at the time
-40-odd years ago—refused to recognise),
was in London when the last mail left. He
J ust made a burned exit 1 rom Mexico.
Kerry was on the oil fields, when the police,
informing him that there would be
alter liirorming mm tnat mcrt «v u ,
some shooting next day, arrested him foi
his safety s sake, and, borrowing his cigar-
ettes, bade him a polite farewell at the
border. Things like that have had a habit
of happening to Kerry all his life.
Commanded to toe the mat regarding his
ant i- ( .xecutm* articles in Sydney Worker,
, w i;n i,* mid the controllers
editor 11. L. l.oote told tne ueu coniioi-eis
of Lan „. aii d the A.L.P. to roast themselves—
or words to that effect. Boote, who came
from the Queensland Worker to his present
job, is. a Mephistoplielean-looking person
whose best literary work was (lone as “Touch-
stone.” in “A Fool’s Talk." He started his
working life as a chainmaker’s boy, but
his strong desire for self-improvement led
him along the Inky Way. His bitter writ-
ings suggest that in the horrible conditions
of the elm mi trmlp some of the iron sank
deep into his soul.
McPherson is winning favor as Vic. Oppo-
sition Leader. He is taking things steadily,
while keeping a watchful eye on Ilogan and
co. He had six years of office as Treasurer
(1917-23), including six months as Acting-
Premier, and knows that the miracles Labor
talked of achieving are impossible. He sees
the Parliamentary machine moving just as
slowly under Hogan as it did under Lawson
and Allan, and reflects, perhaps not without a
chuckle, that while he had surpluses all
through Hogan has io face one big deficit
and prevent another.
Fred Purcell, one of the pillars of Yea
(Vic.) who has gone over the hill very
suddenly, won a majority service in South
Africa in the British-Boer tussle as this
century was dawning. He was remount-officer
at Maribyrnong (Vic.) while the Big Scrap
was on. In his own shire he bagged every
local office available, and a few years ago
had a shot, unsuccessfully, at the Echuca
seat for the Reps.
AVilliam Lucas, of Melbourne, who won
the Commonwealth prize for the design of
the war memorial which is to go up at
Villers-Bretonneux, lr.d the memory of his
own boy to guide his pencil in sketching the
noble tower which will rise 100 feet above
its park setting. The memorial is to be
made entirely of Australian material and is
to cost £lOO,OOO.
America produces a lot of specialists,
but few who are so likeable as Eddie Brinck,
who was killed at Springfield, in Massa-
chusetts, the other day. He arrived in
Sydney not quite a year ago and showed the
motor-cyclists at Maroubra Speedway quite
a lot of things about the capabilities of the
low-powered two-wheeler. lie was a good
sport, too —in a match-race, when his op-
ponent’s machine broke down, he insisted on
having another go—and nobody grudged him
his wins.
Alexander Goldstein, who is extracting
money from the pockets of Australian Jewry
for the Zionist work in Palestine, has
passed on to Melbourne with a feeling that
the South isn't a bad kind of a place. From
Queensland Jewry he gathered £3000; the
450 Jewish families in Maoriland parted
with £0000; and N.S.W. Jewry has anted-
up £(KX)O with the possibility of much more
to follow.
Australia has lost two of its oldest inhabi-
tants : Dan Burke, the Hobart identity, who
celebrated his centenary last June, and 103-
year-old Mrs. Ellen Buchanan, of Denman
(N.S.W.). Both were born in Ireland, but
they left the Quid Sod when they were
children —Burke when lie was two, the lady
when she was 10. <
Castlemaine (Vic.) dropped its flags half-
mast the other day as a tribute to A. E.
Laver, formerly sec. of its Benevolent
Asylum and later of Melbourne Benevolent,
who passed out at Canterbury (N.S.W.).
Many of the old folk who linger, spite of
the few attractions life has for them, remem-
ber A.E. as a humane man who mixed much
kindness with his efficient administration.
C. B. Ware, who has just retired from the
directorate of the Walkerville Brewery, is
one of the best known figures in Adelaide.
He has been prominent in sporting circles,
more especially as a committee-man of the
Adelaide Racing Club. Another turf notable
succeeds him on the board, in the person of
Pat Flanagan, chairman of Tattersall’s Club
and Federal president of the U.L.V.A.
Freddie Johnson, one of the last of the
stalwarts of the golden days of Charters
Towers, was among the prominent person-
alities in Brisbane for the annual exhibition.
Freddie carried on a storekeeping and con-
tracting business on the Towers, but, like
everyone else there at the time, he was
chiefly interested in mining. He held every
principal civic office in the days when the
goldfield was divided between three sets of
civic authorities, Charters Towers proper and
Queenton and Dalrymple shires.
While Vic. Assembly was plugging away
the other night news arrived of the death
of the father of Premier Hogan. Speaker
Snowball spoke some sympathetic words as
the House was adjourning, and members
stood in silence for two minutes. Jerry
Hogan earned fame at Bungaree more than
30 years ago as captain of the hurling club.
That was the open road to his election
to the shire council. A hurling match in
those times was something to see. And a
captain was somebody. Two brothers and
a sister, Mrs. T. L. Conroy, of Ballarat,
join with Premier Ned in the mourning.
Big John Forrest’s expedition of 1874 from
the Murchison (W.A.) to the overland tele-
graph line was nearly the death of the party
of five. John Kennedy, the mounted trooper
with the party—he had to walk most of the
way—who has just taken the long road, was
the last survivor. Blacks attacked the For-
rest party at Weld Springs, but that was
only one of the incidents of a six months’
battle in which thirst was the greatest enemy,
John Smyth, Professor of Education at
Melbourne Uni., was holidaying in Tokio
when Death wrote “finis” to his career.
Smyth was the first graduate of the M.L.
University to get a professorial appoint-
ment in Australia; but first he polished at
Heidelberg, Edinburgh and Jena. He was a
D.Pliil. and had held his last job since 1902.
Ex-Speaker Bowser (Vic.) was more than
casually interested when the news came
through that the Cosgrove Irish Free State
Government had been saved by the casting
vote o'f Speaker Hayes. While occupant
of the Vic Assembly chair last session
Bowser saved the Allan-Peacock Government
several times by his casting vote. His last
effort was when there was a tie on the Seats
Redistribution Bill. There was talk of John
Gordon (now a private citizen) voting agin
the Government, but he kept liis customary
seat in the division. Present Speaker Snow-
ball got A. A. Billson (now an ex-member)
to pair with McLachlan. Then at the last
moment Carlisle (now also a private citizen)
went over to the Opposition, and the tally
was 31 on each side. The knight of Wan
garatta has been almost forgiven by Labor.
Isn’t it in office, anyhow?
THE VINDICATION OF JINKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Jinks, a burly Sligo publican who saved the
Cosgrave Government from defeat by not exercising
his vote, is receiving more publicity than any man
in the British Isles. It is contended on his behalf
by a sympathetic constituent that his absence pre-
vented him from being present.”— Cable.
Ah friend, companero, old mate, amigo,
Dig., cobber, fellow-workman staunch and
tried,
No such certificate, when you and I go
Reluctantly across the Great Divide,
We’ll have to sliow T St. Pete, like Jinks of

An explanation clearly sound and good:
Ilis absence simply came from not being

And when you come to think of it, it
would.
How could he vote —the query gets one’s goat
For crassness—when he wasn’t there to vote.
Boyle Roche’s bird —divert your mind from

That bird to me remains a twisting snipe,
For there are memories Time ne’er effaces
Of whirring targets, snaps that grip and

But no-one’s claimed it for the human type.
Snipe may be omnipresent, but one shrinks
From crediting such qualities to Jinks.

To condemnation until you recall,
Despite all Parliamentary abuses,
Bicker and feud, vendetta, squabble, brawl,
Old Sligo always harks to fair excuses.

“Tongio West”: The recent death of an
old Bunguree (Vic.) farmer robbed the
district of a quaint personality. Nearly i>o
years ago the lads of the village, among their
. flier hilarious doings on New Year's Eve,
hauled the farmer’s plough to the top of a
high tree in his paddock. His frenzied
searching for the implement next day was
watched from ambush by the perpetrators
of the joke, and his flow of language is
ranked as a local record by those who heard
him when he sighted it. After immense
effort in getting it down, lie took no more
chances. Boring two holes in his bedroom-
wall he passed a strong chain through them,
round the plough and to one leg of his bed.
by the side of which he kept a loaded gun
ready for future jokers. To the day of his
death he kept that plough chained to his bed.
“DMcM.”: “Talk about soil!” said the
man from Queensland as they sat round the
fire swapping lies. “W by, th’ bananas is
growin’ that big up in my State we vc got.
ter peel ’em with an axe an’ cut ’em up with
■i crosscut saw!” “I’m not sayin’ yer soil’s
no good,'" the N. S. Welshman countered;
“WONDERFUL WAY OF SEEING THE COUNTRY, ISN ' T IT?”
“but we've patches on our North Coast w'ere
the corn grows so tall that all our corn-
pullin's got ter be done by aeroplane.”
“That’s nothin’,” drawled the man from the
Speck. "There’s a bloke over w’ere I come
from growed a p’tater that ’e ain’t game
fc* dig up. W’y? B'cause Vs afraid o’ th
bottom failin’ outer Tasmania!”
“Gouger” : That sound should attract mos-
quitoes seems improbable, but there is at
least one man who believes it does. 1 was
aboard a lugger sneaking into the mouth
of the Escape River, Cape York Peninsula,
at nightfall. Tlie hoary-headed Dutch skipper
carefully supervised the dropping of the
anchor, threatening to cut the “boys' 1 into
biltong and boil ’em in dugong fat if they
let so much as one link of the chain rattle.
"Da see,” the skipper whispered, "da mos-
keets hear da rattle chain an’ coom like
hell to da feest.” To my surprise, we had a
peaceful night. There may be something in
what the old man said. A mangrove-enclosed
anchorage after sunset is deadly quiet, and
a shrieking anchor chain breaks the silence
with dramatic clamor. Its vibrations quiver
through the air in waves which may be felt
and are certainly heard a great distance
away. Possibly the mosquitoes may follow
the track of the vibrations to the starting
point on the principle that vibration argues
movement. Movement to them is instinctively
something with blood in it.
“Malakuua” :• I have never, iu many years'
experience in New Guinea, seen a native
drinking from a bamboo as “Molokihi” sug-
gests they do (B. 7/7/'-f). Practically every
native carries a polished half eocoanut-shdl
for this purpose, and it would be absurd
to claim that such a vessel “obstructs the
vision.” Frequently these shells are beauti-
fully carved and decorated with symmetrical
white curves, lime burned from beach-coral
being used as the paint.
“Bulantum”: It is true that the New
Guinea natives have an aversion to obscuring
their vision when drinking. Those of the
Morobc district usually include small pieces
of green bamboo in their bags for drinking
purposes. Should bamboo not be available,
a cocoanut-shell is Used as a cup.
"Momfrey Beale": A friend and I wen 1
rabbiting in densely timbered country about
Mineral Hills(N.S.W.). One night, our wood
supply having run low, I went into the bush
and brought back a dead log for the fire.
Next morning the glint of something in the
ashes caught my eye and I fished out four
half-sovereigns. As we’d poked the fire a
good deal through the night 1 sifted the
ashes and salvaged another 10 half-sovs.
Examination of the remains of the log and
of the tree, an immense gum on the bank of
a creek, showed that it had fallen through
the decay of age; apparently the log was
the butt end of a hollow’ spout. A police-
man told me later that it was a common
practice of old-time abos. to hide the spoils
of thefts in such places.
“V.H.R.”: The Tas. Fisheries Commis-
sioners are trying to induce the Government
to strike the platypus off the list of wholly
protected birds and animals. Their chief
argument is that the duck-bill is a menace
to the fisheries, as it feeds upon the spawn.
Perhaps it does, but I question whether it
has ever been caught in the act. As a
frequenter of the rivers. I also doubt vdiether
there has been an "alarming increase in
the numbers of the platypus,” as one Com-
missioner declares. It will be an everlast-
ing disgrace if the Government allows the
destruction of this remarkable water ’ crea-
ture on flimsy evidence. Australia is the
only country in the world that can boast of
the ’pus, and the freak is worth protecting.

“Wang”: The crowd in Ryan's pub had
been talking of storms when Andy Burns
chipped in. “Come outside a minute,” he
said. The mob strode on to the verandah.
“Bee that neddy of mine?” he proceeded,
pointing to his horse tied to a post. “Just
look at his tail.” The spectators did as
directed, and noted that the long flowing
tail that Andy’s moke usually carried had
A MOST DANGEROUS TRACT ICE.

been chopped off square, cobbed to the stump.
“Lightnin’ did that.” the owner affirmed.
“I was out in th’ ranges lookin’ for a couple
stray bullicks w’en th’ storm broke. Th’

nin’—cripes! I never seen sicli lightnin . It
frightened th’ devil outer me ’orse, an’ ’e

’E went straight at it, an’ I expected ’im ter

but jist as ’e got ’ees nose up to it, a flash

now. Gripes, it was a close call!
“Pick”: The theory advanced by “X2X”
(B. 28/7/’27) that egg-shell colorings arc
wholly superficial does not hold good in the
ease of emu eggs. With them the color,
from a dark green on the surface, fades away
through all the shades of blue to a pure
white interior. With a knowledge of these
different shades to work upon, the artistic
egg-shell carver is enabled to decorate the
face of the shell with landscape scenes. Held
beneath water to prevent chipping and with
a sharp pocket-knife or old razor, he retains
the outer green and deeper blue for his fore-
ground, but scrapes the. shell away to the
lighter blues for his middle distances, and
cuts down to the faintest blue and the white
for his background and skies. _ The shells
are about an eighth of an inch in thickness,
and only the thinnest interior fragment is
devoid of pigment.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: The custom mentioned
by “Moe” (B, 14/7/’27) which requires a
native woman who has become a widow to
smear herself with clay is not confined to
Dutch New Guinea. It is practised by a
tribe of aboriginals in the Wallal district
of North Westralia; for a period of four
to six moons (I forget which) the gin is
ostracised from the tribe. A widower is not
penalised to such an extent, but for a cor-
responding period he is forbidden all meat
except goanna flesh. Fortunately for
station owners, who found widowed muster-
ing “boys” useless in salt-junk camps, some
bright person discovered that if ordinary
fat were smeared on the subject the tabu
automatically lifted.
“Ivooragai”: Wonderful the number of
“strange wild animals” that are discovered
in this country! The latest mystery, which
kills dogs and is believed to be a tiger, has
been seen, heard and, it is reported, wounded
iii the neighborhood of Cootamundra
(N.S.W.). The previous scare wars near
the Murrumbidgec, in a region that has been
productive of several fearsome beasts, most
of them creatures of the imagination, includ-
ing a leopard that evaporated and a bunyip
that vanished in the river. The only scare
beast that materialised was the Tantanoola
tiger, which had a long innings in the
Mt. Gambier (S.A.) district, and was eventu-
ally shot by a settler named Donovan, IT
miles west of Mt. Gambier. It proved to
be an Assyrian wolf. —ft.. Sin. high, sup-
posed to have escaped from a menagerie.
Donovan had the skin stuffed, and for years
the curiosity attracted visitors.
“Two Seas” : When I started droving the
pay was 20s. per week, and you had to find
horse, saddle and bridle —not forgetting a
dog. On my last trip I hadn’t a dry stitch
on me for six weeks, bringing 10,000 wethers
from the Queensland border to Narrabn
(N.S.W.) during the great floods of JO.
Owing to the weather we couldn’t keep a
cook more than a week, and I finished up b.v
cooking for the camp of ten, including butch-
ering and cutting up. A quid for seven days
toil! That was considered fair remuneration
by one of our richest pastoral companies.
“Cog”: Does anyone know who invented,
or who introduced into Australia, the steel-
shod springboard used by scrub fullers/ 1
remember seeing two contract gangs operat-
ing on the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) about
IS months ago. One gang used the then
new idea of a 4 x 2 piece of cedar, finished
off with the steel shoe and with one tooth to
grip. The other gang held to the old style
of a stake driven into the tree as a rude
platform. Jim English introduced the board
to the Atherton (N.Q.) scrubs a few years
later. Up there the story goes that a Cana-
dian seaman who had deserted his ship first
used the board on the N.S.W. Northern
Rivers. Did he bring the idea from tlie
Canadian lumber camps? I know it is used
there to-day.
* * # *
“Con Drew”: Though “Toheroa” (B.
28/7/’27) correctly states that the godwit
gulls assemble at North Cape (ALL.) for
their annual trek, there is some doubt as to
where they go. The birds take the air
as at a given signal from an invisibl
starter and fly north. At Big King, the
largest of the Three Kings group, they alight
for a brief rest on a large flat rock and
then resume their flight. The Maoris say
their destination is the Polynesian islands,
and an old legend has it that on one of
their return trips Henare and his brethren
followed in canoes and thus discovered
Maoriland.

They sent us up from Wallaroo,
Me an’ another railway chap,
Shiftin’ rails at Barunga Gap.
When we went up Barunga Gap
We’d been tor weeks at Wallaroo
Out on the jetty, puttin’ through
The broad-gauge line; an we was sick
Of grey sea starin’ through each chink
And cold grey sky, an’ sulphur stink.
But when we went Barunga way
To shift the rails as we was told,
We saw the iirst bright wattle gold ;
We smelt the bohzcr wattle smell —
Gripes! it was gooci. A chap can do
Worse things than come from Wallaroo
An’ see the sunlight through the Gap,
An’ hear the birds, and scent the breeze
Sweet-driftin’ through the wattle-trees !

Throughout the sheep districts of New South *Wales, V ictoria, South Australia
and Queensland dry conditions are generally prevailing.
The output of MEGGITT LIMITED S factories at Parramatta (N.S.W.),
Melbourne (Vic.) and Port Adelaide (S.A.) is naturally insufficient to meet
the demand for MEGGITT’S LINSEED SHEEP NUTS when all States
are feeding their sheep, for this output is governed by the production of
MEGGITT’S LINSEED OIL.
In consequence many clients, some of very old standing, have recently been
unable to obtain prompt supplies of MEGGITT S LINSEED SHEEP
NUTS, the policy of the Company having been to execute outstanding orders
in strict rotation.
To those clients we express extreme regret at our inability to supply their
immediate needs.
We would point out, however, that we are now manufacturing on an increased
scale and will have, therefore, increased supplies of MEGGITT S LINSEED
SHEEP NUTS and MEGGITT’S LINSEED OIL MEAL available for
the month of SEPTEMBER.
It would be greatly appreciated if graziers requiring consignments would let
our various branches or agents know their SEPTEMBER requirements as
early as possible. By doing this they will ensure prompt delivery on the date
specified.

Perfectly Matured Cheese
in spreadable form.
Cheese has its highest food value only when fully
matured for then it is digestive and rich in vitamines.
But your piece cf ordinary cheddar cheese—how often
it is too new and green, or too old and strong ! That is
why it gives you indigestion And how often you throw
away quite a lot of it!
B\EX Luncheon Cheese is always matured to per-
fection —that is the secret of its delightful piquant
flavour and perfect wholesomeness. That is why, too,
it is an aid to digestion And you throw none of it
away—it is always of the same choice quality.
Use a little with, every meal as an indispensable part of
your diet. Spread it like butter on bread, toast or
biscuits, make sandwiches with it; use it fer savouries
—there is no one who will ever tire of its creamy
dekciousness.
Packed new in 2 oz tins as well as the well-known 4oz
tins, and opal porcelain tars

Conger”: The painted skulls referred to
by “C. Coral” (B. 8/0/’27) are not a
solitary group on Prince of Wales Island.
That island, the largest in Torres Strait,
is very rugged, and there are gorges secret-
ing caves and deep waterholes. Many of
the mysterious religious rites of the natives
were carried out in these caves. Old men,
the last of their tribe (now removed to Moa
Island), speak of caverns wherein are built
miniature pyramids of hundreds of skulls,
relics of the victims of war, raids on ship-
wrecked crews and plain murder. In a
small cave rendered invisible by bushes and
overlooking the spot where “C. Coral’s”
raided craft was anchored, there lie the
skeletons of a woman and a child. Further
south, overlooking Cape Melville, there is
a similar cave camouflaged by growing
trees. Inside, on an arrangement of timber,
lies the skeleton of a giant aboriginal. On
Darnley Island there are caves inside of
which are neatly-arranged shelves holding
the skulls of men, women and children.
Cave explorers up North need steady nerves.
SCOTCH REEL.
“Sea Nomad”: In the old days pearl
thieves had to be more expert in the business
of larceny than even gold-pilferers. The
shell was opened on deck before all eyes, and
sleight-of-hand had to be almost perfect
before it could deceive the practised
watchers. On Am Island, where pearl finds
were extraordinarily plentiful, an occasional
diver did the thieving under water. With
wonderful quickness of hand and fingers he
wrenched open the shell and felt tor the
pearl. If there, he slipped it into his mouth
and threw the discard behind. Coming to
the surface, he kept the treasure under his
tongue, and if suspicious of being thoroughly
searched swallowed it. Several wond-
famous pearls have been treated in this way.
The suit diver used to slip the stolen trea-
sure into the sleeve of Ins diving-dress or
into the stocking. When concealed in the
sleeve of the dress the tender above had
necessarily to be in the know, otherwise the
pearl would fall on the deck. Some divers
on coming to the surface made the bottom of
the lugger their hiding-place when appre-
hensive that the vessel and crew would be
searched on reaching port. Little bags con-
taining pearls were sometimes attached
to the keel of the boat. Pearl-thieving by
opening the shell under water was pr :e-
-tised only in localities where the percentage
of pearl-bearing shell ran high. In almost
all the Torres Strait waters, where 20;l
shells might be opened without finding one
pearl, it would be folly to try that form of
pilfering.
* * * *
“N. Conn”: I have seen goannas descend
trees many times, but never as “Pfella” (B.
4/8/'27) describes, except when knocked
off. The last thing a go. will do unless
compelled is to leave his tree while danger
is about. He comes down very leisurely
and with a twist in the tail like the
figure eight, as if it were too much
trouble to hold the appendage up. I
have also seen a large go. stop a
small one climbing the same tree:
although the little chap seemed to
consider he was put in grave
danger by having to clear out.
lie came down by the trunk and
made a dash for another tree.
As for a go. treeing him-
self as a last resort —why.
the tree is his home. Pos-
sibly “Pfella” refers to the
sand goanna, a species I have never seen
climb trees, no matter how hard pressed they
might be. They live in burrows of their
own making, but will take possession of the
rabbit’s.
* * * *
“Mulgo”: An old settler near Tumut
(N.S.W.) does all his odd-job carting with
a bullock harnessed in the shafts instead
of a horse. The animal is steered from the
cart with a pair of reins attached to a
headstall, and pulls with a light collar re-
sembling the horse article but worn upside
down. “Peter” has been the cart-horse for
20 years, and in his prime used to take the
family regularly to church on Sunday. From
a curiosity he became a general pet, and
is known all over the district.
“Vosadina”: Papuans object to our use
of the word “buy” in connection with their
purchase of a wife. They have a distinct
name for this custom. Marriages are
usually arranged by the parents of the
coUples. In a few cases a straightout cash
transaction takes place, as where the bride-
groom lias just been “signed off”; but as a
rule pigs and “shell money” (in the form of
belts, necklaces and white shell armlets)
constitute the payment. Where matriarchal
THE CATCH IN IT.
ERHERT ALFPINT ( enviously ): “’Struth! I’d like ter be as tall as this bloke in the

taste it.”
descent is the rule, as in S.-E. Papua, the
payment is made by the uncle of the youth
to the uncle of the maid; fathers are quite
out of it. Occasionally a couple marry with
out any payment having been made. Nothing
much is said until the husband beats his
wife. Then the wife’s people take her back,
saying that the man has beaten one whom
he has not paid for.
* * * *
“Two Seas” : Many years ago I shot a
native-bear, and the memory of the deed still
revives my self-contempt. My only excuse
is that I was a boy with a new rifle, and the
confiding little animal was the only “game”
that would sit still. Since that day I have
had many Billy Bluegums for pets, and my
honest opinion is that the man who would
shoot them for a living rather than tackle
work couldn’t be trusted with a baby if the
baby’s skin was worth the price of a drink,
As for the Queensland politician responsible
for handing over ah animal that is abso-
lutely harmless to farmer or pastoralist to
the tender mercies of the unemployable, my
opinion of him would melt the type that
tried to set it up.
* * * *
“Ramlila”: The Indian minah, which was
many years ago imported into Fiji, as w’ell
as Vic., has found the islands much to his
liking. There are now countless thousands
of him in the group, and < he follows the
plough in hordes, devouring the _ grubs,
spiders, and so forth turned up in the
furrows. Unfortunately, he also disposes
of pawpaws, granadillas and other fruit
as they ripen, and in his spare time
picks the flowers off the crops of peas
and beans, having an omnivorous appetite.
I saw one reach the limit the other day. I
was riding home through the plantation and
noticed him sitting on a post by the road-
side with something hanging from his beak.
It was a small field-mouse, alive and kick-
ing. He held it firmly by the tail and, as
I watched, tossed it up, bolted it whole and
flew away. Not a bad effort for a bird the
size of a starling!
* * * *
“Bisley”: Last year before giving up my
wanderings around Australia I completed a
list of interpretations of the crude hiero-
on aboriginal message-sticks. In
nearly every case I found the signs to be
attempts to picture as nearly as possible, a
likeness of the subject. For instance, a zig-
zag line running vertically up the stick con-
veys that the sender of the message is on
the march. Long cuts in the stick stand for
men and short ones for women. An emu is
represented by three small strokes made fan-
wise in crude imitation of the footprint of
the bird. One of these symbols surrounded by
small ovals scratched in the stick means that
the birds are nesting. Horses are repre-
sented by something like a sawing horse: a
horizontal stroke with V upside down hang-
ing from each end. Camels or cattle are
similarly graphed, but one stroke of the V at
each end lias an extra mark added to give
the impression of the cloven foot. A circE
flanked by four dots represents a person of
outstanding importance—a white man or a
headman of the tribe. A snake is shown hy
a wavy line, a turtle by a circle from which
radiate four lines right and left and one
each at the top and bottom to show the
presence of the four flippers, the tail and the
head. A frog is shown similarly but with
only four lines representing its legs. A
lizard is a straight line crossed a little way
from the top and bottom by twm other lines,
A wallaby or kangaroo is shown by two lines
meeting at one point—an imitation of the
animal’s footprints,
* * * *
“Murrungurry”: Binghi sometimes did
things by contraries, judged by wliite-pfella
standards. In the towris of the Murray, for
instance, the members of the tribes that
were chosen as ambassadors to travel through
other territories for the purpose of bartering
were generally of lower mentality than the
average, abo. Also they were rather weedy,
though hard and wiry. They carried a load
of various articles wanted by back-country
tribes, and exchanged them for others scarce
or unobtainable in their own territory,
Though these ambassadors were never
molested, they had to take risks in strange
country and often suffered privation on
long journeys. Probably the fool of the
family was chosen for the job on the prin-
ciple that he wouldn’t be a serious loss
if he didn’t come back,
* * * *
“Mullarula”: The blacks of the Wongliibon
and Barkanjee tribes in the flat scrub country
of western N.S.W. had a different way of
making fire from any I have heard described,
One of them once showed me how they did
it. Two pieces of wood were used, one being
of a hard variety, such as yarran or mulga,
and the other soft, such as quandong, wilga
or pine. The soft piece was smoothed on
one side and then partly split so as to
leave a crack in the centre. This was
propped partly open with a small wedge and
filled with finely-shredded bark or some
other inflammable material. The piece of
hardwood was cut down to produce a knife-
like edge, and the operator, placing as much
weight as possible on it, sawed it backwards
and forwards across the other piece
till the material in the crack took fire. I
have since proved that a white man can
produce fire in this way, but if I could borrow
a match by walking half a mile I would
walk.
McCORMACK'S GOLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The ways of men are dark and strange, and
roundabout and sly;
There’s secrets that you cannot learn, how-
ever hard you try;
Which sort of brings it to my mind the
truth’s not yet been told
Of how it was, and where it was, McCor-
mack got his gold.
“I got it at The Gap,” he says. Well, I’m
prepared to swear
No gold like that McCormack’s got has
ever come from there.
I know The Gap too flaming well to swallow
that for true,
And there’s another thing that helps—l know
McCormack, too.
"I got it at The Gap,” he says, and didn’t
even wink;
A clever bloke McCormack is, or so he seems
to think.
Yes, that’s the silly tale he told, and by the
w r ay he spoke
He much as said he didn’t know if he could
trust a bloke.
"I got it at The Gap,” he says, and never
even smiled;
I made as though I took it in as simple as
a child.
The ways of men are dark and strange,
. but damned if I can see
M hy Mac should put a tale like that up on
a bloke like me.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
WARM GAL OATS.
“Cosmo”: The Prells of Gundowringa,
near Goulburn, are experimenting with a
variety of oats not cultivated elsewhere in
the Commonwealth, the Warrigal. They have
over 75 acres of it. They commenced with
three-quarters of a bushel of seed three
years ago, so the grain has proved itself
prolific. This year's crop is now (July)
ready for feeding off, and should be good
for dairy cows or lambing ewes turned on
to it. Algerian sown at the same time has
only grown a quarter of the size and is not
to be compared to Warrigal for feeding olf.
When fully grown Warrigal has a very
thick and tough stem, and is therefore not
much good for hay, but it yields plenty of
grain, which is of good appearance and sells
better than Algerian and similar kinds.
Its sturdy stalk enables it to withstand
heavy storms, and cold weather does not
hinder growth.
ENSILAGE STACKS.
“Pick": “For success with silage,” saith
' C.J.11.” (B. 28/7/’27), “the pit must be
air-tight.” Weil, in the Bathurst and
()range districts, on Southern Monaro
iN.S.W.) and on South Coast dairy-farms
I have seen excellent silage produced in open
stacks. The stuff was stacked in criss-cross
layers when freshly cut, heavily weighted
down by means of crossed poles with weights
attached to their ends, and roofed over. When
opened up for use, to a depth of a foot or
so all round was mouldy waste. Inside that
was a mass that resembled pressed tobacco-
leaf in appearance and smell. But the greed
with which the animals after their first
taste asked for more proved it right as a
cattle fodder.
BLACKBERRY PEST.
“Gundy” : An effective way to get rid of
blackberry is to first clear the ground of.
fallen timber, stones, etc. Then cut down
any large, growths with a slasher or short-
blade scythe. Some people use an . ordi-
nary horse-mower. Follow up by chipping
to ground level with a sharp hoe. Don’t
take on too much at once, as it will be neces-
sary to repeat the chipping several times.
If a very dry season hapnens, get on with
the hoeing for all you are worth, as this
is one of the few good uses of a drought.
The more frequent the clappings the sooner
you will be rid of the pest. Contrary, to
general belief rich river soils are the easiest
to clean up, as the plants, though growing
vigorously, will only go to the depth neces-
sary for moisture. The foregoing treat-
ment is equally effective for bracken, which
1 have killed right' out by four cuttings at
intervals of a month.
ERADICATING BRACKEN.
“Jesmond”: “R.X.8.” (B. 28/7/’27) asks
how to eradicate bracken. The sea is the
best and about the only sure eradicator
I know, though of course its use is imprac-
ticable in 99 per cent, of cases. Here in
Westernport (Vic.) the sandy flats that
occasionally get a flooding of sea water are
absolutely free from the pest. Last year
a bracken-covered flat got its first flooding
with an exceptionally high tide; now there
is not a green fern on it. On the other
hand the sea does not kill the pasture.
Indeed, if it does not lie too long it has a
definite tonic effect, strawberry and Shear-
man’s clover especially showing the benefit.
Mowing, yaking and burning two or three
times a year will weaken bracken, but the
best method is to give bracken country a
heavy top-dressing of superphosphates. The
cattle in searching for the super, trample
down the bracken and even eat it in the loop
stage. In about a month or six weeks run
a fire over the ground to clear it of broken
bracken. The grass-seed left by the cows
thus gets a chance to make a show, and
the super, promotes the growth of the pasture
at the expense of the ferns. If “R.X.8.” will
continue this treatment for a year or two
lie will soon have a good sole of grass
where he now has useless bracken.
TIORSE-BREEDING ON SMALL FARMS.
“Burrum”: “Glenfield” (B. 7/7/’27) may-
be right as far as large farms go, but
breeding horses on a small wheat-farm is
almost always foolish. On most wheat-farms
what land is not in crop of some sort is
fallow, and the foals have to be chaff-fed.
They cost £5 a year for three years without
return, not reckoning service of stallion, loss
of work of mare at a busy time and hours
spent in looking after the young ’uns. I’d
rather buy a live-year-old (that I’ve seen
working) for £3O or £4O and have a horse
that I can put in the team and do a full
day’s work with from the jump.
SHEEP ON WHEAT LAND.
“Tritici”: There is room for more sheep
on our wheat lands. In addition to the lamb
and the wool, which show a decent profit,
sheep keep fallow clean, check weeds and
turn all fodder into a valuable manure. They
can be turned on a forward crop to eat it
back with advantage, and in some districts
this is essential. If you have black soil and
a good rainfall and you aim for wheat yield
and not hay, try this. During wet weather,
when the crop is about six weeks to two
months advanced, turn in all the sheep avail-
able and tramp them about on it as much as
possible. Several instances are on record
where sheep have bolted across a crop owing
to open panels, etc., and though the track
showed up for a time the yield was invari-
ably greater there.
TOP-DRESSING ON THE DAIRY-FARM.
“Titun”: The average cow-cocky in such
districts as Warrnambool (Vic.) is slow; to
take up a proved idea like top-dressing.
The soil and rainfall are ideal, as has
been shown by those who do top-dress.
Considering the simplicity of spreading the
super.—it can be hand-broadcast —the fairly
low price of the stuff, and the excellent
experimental results obtained, top-dressing
should have been the general rule long ago.
The soil is so good, too, and the growth of
grass when manured so dense, that it is a
wonder a few stacks of grass hay are not
put by for a bad winter. The average hold-
ing is generally big enough for some part
of the farm to be set off so that a good sole
of grass may be obtained. Then it’s just
a question ot running the mower over, leav-
ing the grass to dry awdiile and stacking. If
thatched, the stack will keep sweet for years.
But in most cases, as things are, Strawberry
has to take her chance with the natural
grass or the bit of hay the cocky grows.
FOOT-ROT TREATMENT.
“Te Hipi”: The trough method of treat-
ment for foot-rot in sheep unless persisted
in is practically useless, especially in the
case of badly-infected sheep and in wet locali-
ties. The sheep should be run through the
trough at least once a month, and, if the
country is very heavy and damp, fort-
nightly treatment is little enough. Personally
I favor Milestone, about 6oz. to the gallon,
but others claim to get just as good results
from a mixture of quicklime, sulphur and a
small amount of arsenic. If the sheep are
thirsty the latter wash has certainly much
to commend it —sheep won’t drink it.
In the case of badly-infected sheep direct
application is the only real remedy. Melt
lard and add flowers of sulphur and arsenic
in proportions of 4-4-1. While still hot add
kerosene until the mixture is of the con-
sistency of tar. When using, pare the hoof
and brush on the mixture. Then dip the
hoof in boiled linseed oil or shellac to
protect the dressing from wet and keep the
sheep on battens or in a dry, bare yard for
an hour or more, by which time the shellac
or oil should be dry.
DROUGHT INSURANCE.
“Buttenderry” : Where drought conditions
have actually started, it is now too late to
commence conserving fodder on the grand
scale, or to inaugurate any of the drought-
insurance schemes, but it is not too late for
the Government to acquire the unsold portion
of last season’s wheat. There are several
million bushels of wheat conveniently dis-
tributed throughout the State which, if the
drought materialised, could be sold at cost
and would be of great assistance in saving
livestock. If the drought should not arrive,
the grain could still be sent overseas or used
locally, and any loss on the transaction would
bo small. It would be a gamble, of course;
but considering that the stakes are any-
thing up to 55,000,000 sheep, it might be
well worth while.
PHOSPHATES AND LAMBINGS.
“W.P.D.”: Not one word I wrote as to the
necessity of supplying Queensland pastures
with phosphoric acid is disproved by the
statement of “N.M.L.” (B. -8/i/-»)-
Instances where lambing percentages have
fallen off from what they were 30 years ago
(and weanings still more) are to be found
in the country from Warwick to Stanthorpe,
around Mackinlay, between Winton and Clon-
curry, in the Ilughenden district and about
Springsure. There are many more in N.-W.
Q. In these cases there is direct evidence
that poor lambings were the result of insuf-
ficient phosphates in the natural grasses.
To topdress large areas of our western coun-
tries may be an economic impossibility, but
the starved soil, and consequently the starved
animals, can be improved by the provision ot
properly compounded licks. D. E. Donkin, ot
Meteor Downs, has been trying experiments
on a large scale for four years past, and has
found much benefit from a lick consisting of
1801 b.. ground rock phosphate, 1801 b. coarse
salt and about 1201 b. bulk Epsom salts. Nauru
phosphate contains about 46 per cent, phos-
phoric acid and 22 per cent. lime. Die
result has been stronger sheep, better lanib-
ings, ability of ewes to nourish their lambs
and increased wool clips. If to the above
mixture 40 to 50 lb. of cracked maize and
40 to 50 lb. compound meal are added and
thoroughly mixed, a valuable food for lambing
ewes and ewes with lambs results. Eighty
per cent, drops as quoted by “N.M.L., may
be frequent around Barcaldine, but the aver-
age lambing for the whole State for the
season prior to the present drought was 52
per cent.
No one will dispute the necessity for shady
paddocks for lambing ewes'and ewes with
lambs, but this does not affect the question
of lack of mineral salts in their diet. If the
sheep are supplied with the necessary mineral
ingredients in their food it will not harm
them if they carry heavy fleeces, but for
ewes to keep on growing these and also drop
high percentages of strong, healthy lambs
they must have what nature demands, phos-
phates and lime. One of the most urgent
problems requiring scientific research and in-
vestigation is that of the feeding value of our
indigenous grasses and herbage. There are
few graziers who, at some time or other, have
not seen their stock lose condition, their
ewes fail to lamb or to rear their lambs, and
experience losses on apparently ample feed.
We want to know what essential constituents
are missing in these “wasted” pastures; why
they are missing, and how they can be re-
stored or administered in some artificial form
to stock. Recent losses of stock in Queens-
land are not entirely the result of starvation
during the drought. They were certainly, in
the earlier stages, due to malnutrition.
KILLING FOXES.
“Rob. P.”: I have tried the horn filled
with fat idea for poisoning foxes (B.
28/7/’27) without success, and with many
others hold the view that Reynard is too
suspicious to eat anything human hands have
prepared. I once tried killing a lamb near
sundown and filling slits in its tongue with
strychnine. Next morning the tracks around
the body and the bodies of two other lambs
showed that Reynard was suspicious and pre-
ferred to do his own killing.
I have caught many a lamb-killer b£
inspecting likely hollow logs for fresh tracks
after a storm. If the tracks indicate that
the log is occupied, plug up both ends
securely and chop holes along it until the
pest is located. This method means hard
chopping, but the price of the pelt and the
value of lambs saved give compensation.
PHOSPHORUS FOR CROWS.
“Two Seas”: To cope with crows that are
working havoc among lambing ewes, get a
tin and make a number of small holes
in the lid. Put a stick of phosphorus in
another tin with water and pound it into a
fine powder. Place the phosphorus quickly
into the tin with the perforated lid and
carry it in a billycan of wuiter. Find a lamb
recently killed, open it up well, and place it
on its back. Take the phosphorus tin from
the water and quickly shake some of the
phosphorus over the flesh and in the blood
of the dead lamb. The crows will get a fatal
dose that they can’t vomit up, as they can
other baits.
Phosphorus is highly inflammable, and
should not be kept out of water for more
than a few seconds. It should always be
cut or broken up under water.
WOOL POOLING FOR SMALL MEN.
“Leo Lear”: As “R. E. Combing” says
(B. 21/7/’27), small wool-growers are handi-
capped in classing. In large sheds classers
have some chance of putting together big
lines of even-quality wool, which are com-
peted for at good prices. But the smaller
man’s flock is seldom evenly bred, and often
consists of saleyard lots, picked up in
small lines cheap. This man’s clip is sijlit
up into five- and six-bale lots, competition
is limited, and the speculator takes advan-
tage. Through judicious buying and then
re-classing into large lines, he makes a good
profit, which ought to be in the pocket
of the producer.
The remedy is for the small men to stand-
ardise their wool by shearing at one central
shed in any given district, and pooling their
wool, so that the classer can run it out into
big lots. The experiment was tried in
Western Victoria, on the Melville Forest
Estate that was portioned out to Indian
Army officers. While. the arrangement
lasted, their combined clips brought prices
pence in advance of any small lots of similar-
quality wool. Every season hundreds of
bales of skirtings, etc., are pooled. Why not
extend the practice to whole clips?
HOLDING PIGS.
“Sylvester": “Spike’’ and "Dennis” (B.
21/7/’27) talk about holding pigs until the
market is suitable. llow do they hold ’em?
Here (Queensland) a first-class baconer
must weigh between Do lb. and 1251 b. Below
this prices slide and above it they Hop. As
a fully-grown pig in condition weighs about
2501 b., the farmer has to get his .pigs fat
before they grow too large. My neighbor
took two pigs in. and the lighter one brought
over 20 shillings more than the heavy one.
No pig will fetch as much as the one that
weighs 1251 b.
DECLINE OF THE HORSE.
“Spike” : Half a century ago a horse the
like of which is nowadays only legend could
be bought for a bob anywhere along tin
N.S.W. North Coast. When the A. A. Co.
first took over the huge tract of country
extending from the Hunter to its far north
as Gloucester and beyond, the horse was con-
sidered valuable property. The directors
deemed the breeding of a hardy type of ani-
mal an advantageous and lucrative enter-
prise. By importing a breed of active and
compact Arab stallions and mating them to
line upstanding English mares their ideas
soon materialised, and for a time the studs
nourished exceedingly. But as a result of
excessive output prices slumped rapidly, th •
rails were dropped and hundreds of head of
blood-stock “went bush.”
Hunted from the open country, the horses
trekked coastward to the mountains, where
they multiplied considerably and soon evolved
into a magnificent type of animal, nimble,
hardy and full of fight. They preserved
these characteristics until in-breeding com-
menced. Alive, they were almost worthless;
dead, their hides were worth from 7s. to 10s.
The A. A. Co., anxious to rid its holdings of
the brumbies in order to stock more heavily
with cattle, gave trappers curie blanche to
dispose of them, and a wholesale slaughter
commenced.
Since those far days, and despite the bene-
ficial influence which racing is supposed to
have had on the breeding of horses, the type
of light utility mounts has deteriorated to
such an extent that a staunch, serviceable
animal for stock work is now almost unpro-
curable.
The draught type has fared better. The
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture, by
acquiring picked stallions and breeding from
sound mares only, has done much towards
the improvement of the heavy horse. With
the advent of the tractor, however, less atten-
tion is being paid to draught horse-breeding.
The department ought to turn its attention to
the breeding of a genuine stock-horse, the
demand for which will always be heavy while
there is stock to muster and rough country to
traverse. If it is left in the hands of private
studmasters —who imagine they are improv-
ing the type of stock and light utility horses
by breeding from herring-gutted animals to
whom six furlongs or a mile on a carpet
track with only a dwarf on top is a struggle—
then it’s a poor look-out for the Australian
stockman, who, after all, is only as good as
his horse.
CITRUS SPORTS.
“Hop Scrub”: The “sporting” habits of
citrus trees to which “Poncirus” alludes
(B. 21/7/’27) are oft-times of value. Two
recent Queensland discoveries originated as
“sports”—one from the Valencia and the
other from the navel. Thomson’s navel,
which has certain advantages of flavor and
earliness, was a Washington-navel mutation.
Further, bud selection is not the whole
answer. Much of the variation between trees
in the same orchard is undoubtedly due to
soil factors and to differences in stocks.
Also, it is not an established fact that trees
propagated from a superior individual tree
are necessarily superior. A possibility of
their being so is indicated, nothing more.
It is probably better to secure scions from
trees of good age. at least 10 to 12
years, and of established fruiting habit, but
it does not necessarily ensure better orchards
and bigger profits. Cases are known where
apple-trees all propagated from one parent
tree have exhibited as much variation as
could be found in an orchard indiscriminately
propagated and growing under similar con-
ditions. However, Shamel’s work on citrus
proved that certain types of degeneracy, e.g..
excessive sucker growth, might be perpetuated,
and to be on the safe side he recommends
taking buds from trees of quality, as “Pon-
cirus” indicates.
Scientifically there is not _ such a thing
as a “pedigreed” tree. Variations due to
“acquired characteristics,” occasioned by dif-
ferences in stocks, moisture, food supply

Dear Sirs, —In February, 1925, I took delivery of a line of Weaners which I purchased
on Monaro, and after I got them home they turned out to be very flukey and were dying-
like flies. I purchased a ton of “LIX-ALL” through your Agents at Junee, and begun
giving it to these flukey sheep. Very soon I saw an improvement in them and they left
off dying, and in the course of a few months they had left off coughin' and they were
quite sound and healthy. It gives me much pleasure and satisfaction u recommend the
“LIX-ALL” to anyone who may have flukey sheep.
Kindly send me another half ton immediately. Yours- faithfully,
“Eurolie,” Junee Reefs. JOS. HEFFERNAN.

Dear Sir, —I already have a supply of “LIX-ALL,”
and have used same in the dry time, and 1 find it
to be a good lick; sheep put on condition, whilst
other sheep on other licks lost condition. Would
like to tell you that I have recommended it to
others in this district, and will do by best for
you.
I remain, Yours truly,'

and environmental factors generally, are
not transmitted and cannot be perpetuated
by selective propagation. All of which being
the case, selective propagation is not a job
for the grower. The Commonwealth Citrus
.Research Station at Griffith is testing eight
different strains of Washington navels, buds
being selected from places as far apart as
Mangrove Mountain and Pyabb, and activity
in this direction could be extended with
profit if money enough were made available.
One of Australia’s real needs is specialised
fruit experimental stations to discover a few
of the multitude of things in connection
with fruit trees that to-day we only guess at.
HONEY COLOR AND FLAVOR.
“Larrapinta”: “Orn” (B. 28/7/’-/ ) says
the consumer of honey judges by flavor and
not by color, and, further, that the Maori-
lander is right in placing flavor first in
grading his honey for export. Well, here's
the explanation. Maoriland exports only
clover honey, which is always of a (dear,
almost water-white color, but sometimes
lacks flavor. The Maorilander’s problem,
therefore, is to produce it honey with a good
flavor; he never has to trouble about color.
On the other hand, the best Australian honey,
gathered from gum-blossoms, is of a beautiful
flavor and aroma, but the color varies, rang-
ing from very light gold to amber. The over-
seas representative of the Australian honey
pool, R. E. G. McDonald, now in London,
has found that the English consumer wants
a mild-flavored honey, with a light color.
The Aussie beekeeper’s job is to see that
he gets it.
THE NEW TOBACCO DISEASE.
“Azac”: Black root-rot, considered in
America as the worst disease of the tobacco
crop—Australian growers thought nothing
could be worse than blue mould —has
appeared in N. S. Wales. That the fungus
causing the disease must have been present
in the State for some years is pretty evi-
dent since the disease appeared in all three
tobaeco-grofwing districts —Tumut, Bathurst
and Tamworth —simultaneously.
When in the Tumut district some five
months back, I saw the havoc the disease
was working on the crops of that district. It
was not then known that the disease was
black root-rot, hut it has since been identified
as such by Plant Pathologist Mandelson, of
the Department of Agriculture. One crop I
saw was very patchy, the diseased plants
being only fi to 12 inches high, with yel-
lowed leaves, and were even at that immature
stage going into flower. Practically no
leaves at all could be pulled from the diseased
plants. The amount of damage can be
gauged from the fact that the estimated
yield of the State’s crop of tobacco for the
last season is only 3Ooocwt., whereas the
average annual yield is some 14.000 cwt.
There’s not much the. grower can do apart
from rotating crops and making sure the
seed-bed soil is free from infection. And
the suggestion of adopting a rotation in order
to starve out the fungus will not appeal
to many as being very practical; American
experience goes to show that the ground
would have to be kept from under tobacco
for the best part of 10 years to be certain
of freeing it from infection. Moreover, many
of the alternative crops-—peas, beans, .melons,
lucerne and others —are also subject . to
attack by the same fungus disease.
Why not take a lead from the U.S.A. and
breed resistant varieties of tobacco, or else
import some of the proved resistant Ameri-
can varieties which they have so success-
fully raised?
In any case, there is no need for a great
scare and a scoot from the industry. Ameri-
can experience, while it proves this to be the
worst disease when it does appear in the
tobacco field, also shows that it requires
a peculiar combination of climatic condi-
tions to set the fungus in action. The
fungus might therefore be present in your
soil, but unless the season particularly
favors its development, the crop will not
be attacked. In the light of last year’s
experience there appears to be little doubt
on this point. The fungus, must have been
present in N.S.W. soils prior to last year,
and it was only the abnormally wet and cold
conditions that set it going. ,
EGG EXPORT.
“Silentio”: Poultry farming in N.S.W. is
now on such a scale that export of eggs
is essential. When the egg pool made a levy
of Id. per dozen on all eggs marketed the
ledger balanced thousands to the bad. The
pool is now going to advance Is. per doz. to
the farmer, find an extra fid. to pack and ship
overseas, and make adjustments when sales
are effected in London or elsewhere. On
present indications each consignor will have
75 p.c. of his eggs sold locally at Is. fid.,
and 25 p.c. exported at Is. advance. Thus
a 12-dozen case w 7 ould realise 165., or an
average of Is. 4d., out of which has to come
commission and freight. If production goes
up higher than usual the export proportion
will increase, automatically lowering the
average price. Speculative f.o.b. buyers
will operate at Is. 4d. J. B. Merrett. of
Maoriland, will operate heavily in N.S.W.
this year, but he takes only a 2oz. egg,
whereas the pool packs several grades,
according to Commonwealth marketing regu-
lations. By the time sales are made over-
seas, and a pi’oportion set off to previous
years’ pool losses, the poultry farmer can’t
expect much in the adjustment. The pros-
pects are not rosy. Big men may weather
the storm but it looks as if many of the
smaller fry will have to quit.
CIRCULAR-SAW SPEEDS.
“Liss”: “Larrapinta” (B. 14/7/’27) will
find that if he increases the speed of that
24in. saw of his to at least 1200 r.p.m., he
will increase its efficiency considerably. The
speed universally accepted as the one which
gives the best results is 9000 ft. per minute
on the rim of the saw. but this is for ripping,
and a little less will do for cordwood: and
9000 ft. p.m. on the rim of a 24in. saw is
equal to 1500 r.p.m. on the spindle.
Power is lost and saws are blunted on
most firewood benches from other causes,
chief among which are untrue hanging of the
saw, caused by worn bearings, generally, and
belt slip. Most petrol engines have a speed
of round about 500 r.p.m. and it is usually
impracticable to fit a pulley larger than 24in.
It is therefore necessary to have pulleys of
from Bin. downwards on the saw spindle
according to the size of the saw, and this is
conducive to belt slip.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Two Seas”: A good top-dressing for tin
roofs, tanks, etc., which absorbs a good deal
of the sun’s heat and reduces temperature
inside can be made this way. Slake half a
bushel of fresh lime with hot water, cover-
ing it with two or three heavy bags while it
is slaking, and leave it covered for half an
hour. Add to the lime lib. of soft soap
dissolved in hot water, and lib. of alum, also
dissolved. Then cover up well and leave
for three days. To prepare for use thin with
hot water to the consistency of paint and
strain. Apply to the roof with a small
whitewash brush. Give two coats, with
about a week between. Coloring matter
may be added. Brick, stone or roughcast
walls can be treated in this way, and the
dressing will withstand the weather for
three or four years.
“M.T.C.”: “R. E. Combing” (B. 28/7/’27)
omits to mention that it is frequently quite
impossible to distinguish between canary-
stain and yolk. An infallible test, however,
is to take a staple of the yellow-tinged wool
and wash it in hot, soapy water. If it is
merely yolk it will wash out —canary-stain
will not budge.
“W.M.F.”: The rough-and-ready way in
which lamb-marking is done in some places
is a disgrace to those in charge. One thing
that should always be guarded against is
marking lambs in yards where sheepskins
have been hanging on the rails. Much loss
from blood-poisoning results from neglect of
this precaution. The same thing applies to
shearing-sheds. Under no circumstances
should skins be allowed to lie about the
shearing-pens or the board. And many a
good sheep has been lost, too, because pigs
are allowed in woolsheds.
“Boronia”: Root-rot (armilldria) gives the
apple-grower a lot of trouble. It is caused
by a fungus in decomposing wood, with which
a root of the fruit-tree has come into con-
tact. The smaller roots, which will be found
to be coated with an evil-smelling slime, must
be cut away, and the large ones must be
thoroughly scraped and disinfected with a
strong solution of lime, sulphur and sulphate
of iron. The roots treated should be exposed
to the air and sun for at least two days.
Sulphate of iron can be mixed with the soil
before it is returned round the roots, and,
finally, the tree must be pruned back with-
out much mercy.
“Sucre”: When your cattle-dog behaves as
if he were poisoned, push a lump of common
washing-soda about the size of a plum down
liis throat and hold his head up for a few
seconds. Vomiting will immediately follow the
operation and the poisonous matter will be
expelled.
“T.J.” : It is usually the first night off the
board that is dangerous to winter-shorn sheep.
If the sheep are weak and the weather
extremely cold it is safest to run the jnm-
bucks into a shelter-shed for the night rather
than turn them out in the paddocks. On no
account should freshly-shorn sheep be turned
out in sleety rain. But the most dangerous
thing of all is to take sheep off the board in
the afternoon and drive them to a paddock
some miles distant from the shed in cold
rain. I saw 500 wethers in strong condition
killed in this way. They became heated
through travelling, and the sudden cooling-
off was too much for them.
“Allambee”: Judging by the number of
straining-posts one sees with the strut placed
near the top, very many fencers must be
unaware that the post is more likely to lift
out of the ground like that. If the strut
is placed two-thirds of the height, the strainer
will hold in the ground better.
“Bill R.”: For curing a horse of fistula
the most effective specific is arsenic. The
upper part of the swelling on the prad’s
withers is punctured, and without any drain-
ing as much arsenic as can be held on a
threepenny-bit is injected. In less than a
month the fistula should have completely
dried up.
“Yufu”: the quickest way to give relief
to a badly-griped horse is to dose him with
a Viz. each of ether and laudanum. The
drugs act very rapidly.
“Yufu”: By forcing rhubarb in a frame
the flavor is immensely increased. The
stalks are so protected that they grow
rapidly and are not toughened by exposure.
Better than kerosene tins, for the frames,
are boxes or bark. Tin is liable to scorch
the plants in hot weather. Leaf mulch is
a splendid manure.
“D.McG.”: To cure sore mouth in lambs
use the half of a two-pound preserved-fruit
tin, in which place enough melted mutton fat
to cover the lamb’s mouth and nose. Care
should be taken that the fat, while quite
liquid, is not too hot. Put the sheep in a
small yard or check pen; put your right hand
over the lamb’s head and hold the fat tin
in the left. You can then dip his mouth and
nose quickly. The air instantly cools the
fat in the lamb’s nose and lips, and in three
or four days he is right. I have thus cured
lambs whose lips "were so cracked that they
were on the point of dropping off.
“J.P.” : To secure rapid growth of chicks
extras should be added to the diet —cod liver
oil, milk, fresh eggs and plenty succulent
green feed help to bring on growth. These
things are not fads but necessities if maxi-
mum growth is aimed at and consequent
early laying. Suppose they cost a bob a head
more to rear this way. it doesn’t take long to
pay back your bob with interest if the puilets
lay a month earlier, and are stronger and
better developed to carry on with the good
work of laying right on through winter when
eggs are worth real money.
“Wat L.”: llow is it that one seldom
sees limes on sale? They crop more heavily
than the lemon, and contain considerably
more juice, bulk for bulk. The only place
where I have seen them really plentiful is
Cooktown (N.Q.). They were evidently
planted in considerable numbers in the early
days and now there are hundreds of trees
growing wild. At times. I have seen a patch
of two or three acres literally yellow with
the fallen fruit.

GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINT.
“S.N.R.”: Mac was hand-feeding his sheep,
lie had been doing it for many lean weeks,
and he’d noticed the bank manager’s manner
undergoing a change of late.
Out of nowhere came a mounted stranger,
with “pommy” leggings and all, on a well-
fed nag. “Day!” he said in greeting.
Mac looked up from dispensing the jum-
bucks’ nerve-nuts. “Good-day,” he recipro-
cated.
“Got any ground sale?” came the
stranger’s high-pitched, cliopped-oif query
across the boundary fence.
“The whole lot —at a price. Like to have
a look round?”
“Thanks—awfully good you.”
“The gate’s just a couple o’ chains along
there,” said Mac as, unhitching his horse
from the rail, he got into the saddle and pro-
ceeded to accompany his visitor on a tour of
inspection. As they ambled along he ex-
patiated with due restraint on the possibili-
ties of the property “in an average season.”
The stranger was politely enthusiastic and
encouraging but non-committal.
When the circle was completed. “Very nice.
Quite all right should think when get few
inches rain,” he said. “But you haven’t
answered my first question yet.”
“What was that?” asked Mac puzzledly.
“Whether got any grey’ounds for sale. I
was thinkin’ doin’ bit rabbitin’ ”....
“Greyhounds? Strewth!”
Mac turned and rode slowly and sadly back
to the house. He didn’t remember till after-
wards that he hadn’t answered the question
after all.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was past dinner-time. Andrew Bolitho,
somewhat taut round the middle through
accommodating hunks of “pasty,” moved
heavily in the direction of the quince-tree.
He inspected the green fruit with the true
gourmand eye; some he smelt as a further
test of ripeness. Then one on a topmost
branch attracted his notice. “That’s a joocy,
all right,” he murmured as, squinting in
the sun's rays, he tilted his head back for a
better look- Then he took off his boots —
“Kin climb better in me stockin’ feet,” he
told himself in confidence, this being but a
phrase, his feet being bare.
Pausing only long enough to examine the
progress of a broken toenail, he ascended.
Nearing the top he had a fine view of Ryan's
yard. Dan was there sitting astride the
wood-horse. The saw was in evidence, the
wood-heap also. But Dan’s hands, instead
of guiding the implement, were pressing the
notes of a voiceless corcertina. The instru-
ment gave forth no answer save a windy-
sobbing—clearly its race as a music-maker
was run.
So engrossed was Dan in the silent con-
certo that a quince was needed to engage his
attention. Catching the fruit,
lie buried his teeth in its wholly
green hide and flapped his large
ears treewards, listening casu-
ally while the orchardist in-
quired his plans, if any, for the
afternoon. Dan had plans. His
mother’s goat had strayed. It
was last seen near Moriarty’s,
Back Creek way. His mother
feared it had fallen down one
of the old shafts which, with
abandoned drives, honeycombed
the flats thereabouts.
Mrs. Ryan appeared at the
back door. “You go and find
Nanny,” she said; and after she
had almost thrown herself out
of joint in the effort to strap
Dan from the other side of the
muddy yard, she went inside “to
call father.”
Dan wasted no time in join-
ing Andy in the ti’ee. The
threats of his parents only gave
added zest to the fruity dessert.
Under cover of mucn wrang-
ling among their elders the refu-
gees slithered down stealthily
and took to their heels through
the Bolithos’ cabbages, followed,
when discovered, by clods of
earth and missiles of varied
form.
Once out, they decided to look
for the goat. Passing down Tre-
voe’s lane, they presently found
themselves, seemingly by in-
stinct, on the wrong side of Tre-
voe’s fence. His plums were
but so so, but a glorious circus
act was staged as round and
round his cow-paddock the boys
careered, attaching themselves
to the tails of various of his
Jerseys - those noted for their
high-kicking abilities. A bit fur-
ther on they “got a chase” from
“the Chinks” in a market gar-
den : but, as Dan said, “It was
worth it,” the young radishes
secured being highly satisfac-
tory. Their thoughts running
on the yellow portion of the
population, it was almost de-
cided to raid the camp—a col-
lection of mean hovels and sap-
ling-fences that crouched on the
side of Gum Hill. But, as
Andrew recollected, they were
unarmed and both had seen the
fate —at a picture-show—of two
Britishers who had trespassed
too far on the hospitality of
Confucius.
Regretfully then they passed
on. finding some solace, how-
ever, in poking sticks at an
ancient fossicker working the creek. See-
ing lie was unarmed they drew nearer to
worry the ancient with silly questions as
to his possible wealth and the number of
his family. Then, tiring of them, the gold-
seeker made lunges at them with a murder-
ous-looking knife which he seemed to carry
somewhere among his bones. This somewhat
unnerved Andrew. His uncle had “sooer-
cided” and the knife woke ugly memories
of the dead; therefore, with many cries of
"Cran —ky Char—ley,” they pushed on in
search of the goat.
On Gully Hill they tarried long enough
to prospect it thoroughly. The scene of old
diggings long since abandoned and now-
given back to Nature, it was rich in nuggets
if one could “only sight ’em,” so boys of the
neighborhood affirmed. Water-tracks where
rain had rushed dowm the hillside to the
gully below made wavy lines and laid bare
the gravelly nature of the earth. Andrew
and Dan, on all fours, went up and down
searching assiduously for specks, but their
industry went unrewarded save for a few
bits of mica and a shiny, water-worn trouser-
button. So, as the afternoon was waning,
they thought once more of the goat, bending
their minds to business. Their stomachs, too,
now some hour or so without nourishment,
needed replenishment, and this was accom-
plished by their invading a far-reaching and
unprotected corner of the Chinaman’s garden
—well filling their shirt-bosoms with green
fruit ere "the Chink's dawg” reached them.
It so happened that temptation assailed
ere they went further. Dan’s flapping ear
it was to first catch the sound of voices—the
voices of the “Crutchety push” raised in
jubilation. Quickly he sniffed their where-
abouts. They were at the waterhole, he
reckoned. “They’re bathin’,” he affirmed —
“swimmin’; the water’ole mus’ be full with
las' week’s rain. Cornin’?”
“Aw right,” agreed Andy, conscious that
his toenail, now very sore through being
lined with gravel, would be the better for
cleansing. “Aw right, I’m on. We got ’s
much right ’s them other blokes —they don’t
pay no rat Cs.”
A dozen or more lads there were, big
and little, bony and fat, but all brown and
sunburnt. Koine strolled boldly in till the
yellow water was neck-high. Others hugged
the bank, fondling the slimy edges with their
THE OFFERTORY.
feet. The waterhole was dotted round with
shirts and pants, here and there a pair of
boots belonging to youths whose mothers
had “stuck-up” notions against, bare feet.
After greetings, hostile for the most part
-—for the newcomers belonged to a rival
clique—a truce was called.
Safe enough, w 7 ith caution, as a bathing-
place, the waterhole (forbidden joy of every
lad in the locality) was sufficiently deep
in the middle to drown a man. Duly those
considered expert in swimming ever dared
cross it; and thus it was that Mack and
Abbott, after proving their ability, suggested
that each take across anyone who would
volunteer, merely to demonstrate their
powers.
Andrew offered for active service at once.
Neither lie nor Dan could swim-—here was
the opportunity to learn.
Confidently the trio started across, Andy
clinging to the shoulders of the experts and
supported by an arm of each. But soon it
was found that swimming the basin unen-
cumbered was a different matter from swim-
ming it laden.
Presently all were in difficulties. By the
time they were half over the experts had
decided that it was each man for himself—
better one drown than three. Andy, seeing
his supporters had lost confidence, at once
promptly lost his. He started to struggle.
That settled matters. With the swimmers,
regard for their helpless companion’s safety
was swallowed up in a fierce desire to escape
drowning. Reason fled and Panic took control.
Andy felt himself cast adrift. Like a stone
he sank. As he did, he caught a glimpse of
the other bathers turning frightened faces
toward him and of a hasty shoreward move-
ment.
It seemed miles down till his feet touched
the oozy bottom : then he rebounded. With
a blind instinct for his life he tried to throw
himself shoreward as he rushed up through
the water to the surface. In a second of
time he noted that, with the exception of
Dan, his companions were all on dry land,
dressing in haste in ludicrous postures. .Even
in that terror-stricken moment, as he was
sinking for the second time, Andy’s brain
took photographs that would last for ever—
pictures that at another time would cause
bursts of. ihorrimont. Sam Short with his
shirt on upside down, and young Foxy Miller
wobbling on one leg while he wrestled with
his boots; Carroty Blight’s waist-belt of
string, which, day or night, never left Car-
roty’s person, now taut and hard with
water and refusing on that account to have
either shirt or trousers inserted beneath it!
Thus, had Andy drowned there in Butt’s
waterhole, his last earthly vision would have
been Carroty Blight’s trouble with his
waist-belt.
But Andy did not. drown, for by reason of
his lunge shoreward lie sank the second
time in shallower water. The third time
he did not rise at all, for he sank only to
his chin. Oh, the joy of solid contact with
the slimy floor of the hole —the delight of
adding fresh injury to his toenail on a
half-buried broken beer-bottle, and relief
from deadly fear inspired by the grab of
Dan Ryan’s hand in his hair. As Dan
hauled him out he saw the other bathers
scudding guiltily away—whether for purposes
of rescue or of establishing an alibi none
knew —last of the absconding vanguard being
Carroty, a study in the nude, his refractory
belt eating into his middle and his entire
wardrobe dangling from liis hands.
Andy lay aw-hile, his heart throbbing wildly
and painfully. Though affecting to take the
incident casually, both boys were a little
white about the gills; momentarily un-
manned, their mouths contorted wryly and
a few 7 smarting tears were furtively wiped
aw 7 ay. Dan found relief in objurgating the
absconders. “Cow 7 5,” he said. “Sech blanky
cows didn’t oughter be let use this water-
hole. Nex’ time I ketch any o’ that gang
I’ll drownd ’em same as I would a litter o’
pups.” -
Dark was now approaching, so David
and Jonathan decided on making tracks
homeward. “Let the dashed nannygoat rip,
we’ve looked for her long enough,' said
Dan to his painfully limping companion.
“Nex’ time she’s gutter be found, me old
man kin turn out. Let ’em bring the police
and the fire-engine if he likes. 7 look ler
no more goats. What 11 yer old man do to
yer for going in the water?” he continued.
“S’pose them dashed blanks’ll split.’’
“I'll get leathered most likely,” Andrew
grunted. “Bin told ter keep away from tlm
’ole more limes than I can count. But what's
a leatherin’? And his belt’s old,” he added,
with a note of comfort—-“any’ow, wot’s the
odds?”
As the lads turned the Trevoe lane once
more they came upon the missing goat, re-
clining beneath the acacia hedge. She looked
comfortable, and the cud she chewed seemed
tasty. Turning benign eyes upon the boys,
she moved her ears daintily when questioned.
Rudely dislodged by Dan and soundly cursed,
she consented to a leading-string, and the
cavalcade proceeded—proceeded until some-
thing like a whirlwind of life-saving
humanity bore down on them round Trevoc's
corner. A spring cart, rolling and rattling
over stumps and ruts with the Bolithos- -
mum and dad-—being shaken to pieces in
it. Mrs. Ryan, still in her husband’s hat;
old Hodg.e the policeman ; the grocer’s boy ;
all the baker’s staff: children, and any un-
attached citizens with time to spare were
willing to swell the crowd of life-savers.
For, sure enough, the. Crutchet.v push had
“squeaked,” and that Dan and Andrew had
been drowned was the current topic of the
hour.
But these heroes, docilely plodding home-
ward with the goat, gave the lie to rumor,
and the mourners’ grief gave place to a desire
for discipline. The lads found themselves
yanked aboard, dodging with practised dex-
terity the chastisement with which their day
ended.
Later, over the dividing fence, they ex-
changed experiences. “Wliat’s a bit _of a
lambastin’, anyway?” inquired one. “Nothin’
—nothin’ at all,” responded the other as lie
devoured tomatoes.

Information Sought.
(a) If rain falls 150 miles from Charle-
ville, could the clouds he seen at Charle-
ville? (b) If a fire occurred at Tambo (100
miles from Charleville) could any evidence
of it he seen at the latter town? (c) If a
direct line be drawn from Charleville
towards the horizon to a point (X) distant
400 miles, what height would X he from the
earth? (d) Could clouds he formed at this
height? ( e) What is the greatest distance
along the line that clouds could he seen? —
968.
(a) Clouds form at heights ranging from
a few hundred feet to about 30,000 feet.
The highest cloud 25 degrees above the
horizon would not be more than 13 miles
away, and lower clouds would be less distant.
Atmospheric refraction alters the path of a
ray of light coming from a distant cloud
so that the light travels roughly along the
arc of a circle of diameter five to seven times
that of the earth. Refraction curves the
path of light from a cloud downwards
towards the earth and thus increases the
maximum distance at which cloud can be
seen. Over level ground some light from
an object 12,800ft. high would reach the
earth as far away as 150 miles. A thunder-
storm cloud might penetrate to the 30,000ft.
level and the tops of an isolated cloud
might be seen 150 miles away, but they
would be only a degree or two above the
horizon. (b) Some light from an object
5700ft. high would reach the earth as far
distant as 100 miles. The bush-fires of
Victoria send volumes of smoke much higher
than 5700ft. Again, the wind might carry
smoke towards an observer. Either of these
two circumstances might allow an observer
to see evidences of a fire 100 miles away,
(c) If a line tangential to the earth’s sur-
face at A be continued for 400 miles to X,
then X would be 200 miles vertically above
the earth. However, owing to refraction,
some light from an object at X would reach
the earth’s surface as far distant as 430
miles. (d) Clouds could not form at a
height of 20 miles. (e) With a sheet of
cirrus cloud at a height of 30,000ft., the
cloud at the horizon would be 228 miles
away. On a day of good visibility the
cloud at the horizon could be seen. The
theory used in the above calculations is set
out in “The Elements of Sui-veying and
Geodesy,” by W. C. Popplewell (Longmans).
A good way of keeping lemons for use
■in the summer months. —979.
First, very careful picking (clipping) is
necessary and very careful handling. Lemons
large enough (up to 2iin. in diameter) but
still green in color will keep the longest.
Yellow-colored fruit will not keep long.
After careful clipping, place the fruit in
paper-lined boxes and store in a cool place.
Boxes should be full, as the free admission of
air results in a drying out of the skin,
which will eventually go quite hard. Green
lemons should keep up to four months.
I am working on shares for one year;
duties, “general farm work.” Are grubbing,
post-cutting ana, fencing “general farm
work”? What hours should I work? —1229.
“General farm work” in a shares contract
is, in the absence of any provision to the
contrary, such work as will yield a result
the value of which can be shared by both
parties. “Grubbing, post-cutting and fencing”
improve the owner’s property but do not
yield the immediate or early benefit to both
parties an ordinary shares contract contem-
plates. As you arc not an employee but a
party to a coutract, the hours you work are a
matter of agreement.
(1) I’m a Maorilander. How would I get
the land on which to trap or poison rabbits?
(2) How establish a connection with a
buyer? (3) Which are the more profitable,
skins or carcases? (4) Do the agents
buy all the year round? (5) Not being
afraid of hard graft, could I make a good
living at it? (6) How far from Sydney
could a chap get started? (7) Would £100
be sufficient for an outfit?- —1163
(1) Permission is only to be had from
landholders; necessary generally to go per-
sonally to secure it. (2) No need to estab-
lish a connection with a buyer. Dealers in
skins operate in practically all country towns,
but best send for sale to Sydney selling
agent, who will sell by auction. These
agents supply consignment forms, address
labels, directions for handling skins, etc.,
free of charge. (Sample packet of station-
ery from one of the Sydney firms posted.)
(3) At present about the same from skins
and carcases. Average market value of a
rabbit-skin is 6d. to 7d., but some of the
higher grades are worth Is. to Is. 3d. each.
(4 & 5) Rather late now to start rabbiting
this season. The quality will shortly start
to fall off and summer skins are never as
valuable as the winter classes. A good living
can be made in the winter-time from skins.
(6) There is good skin country within 150
m. of Sydney. (7) Probably £IOO, carefully
spent, would cover cost of a second-hand
lorry or Ford car, with necessary equipment.
Can I open a registry office for domestics,
etc., in N. S. Wales? Must Ibe registered?
If so, how do I go about it? —1227.
Must be licensed by Dept, of Labor and
Industry. Notice of application must be
advertised in two metropolitan daily papers.
It is permissible for any person to appear
before the inquiry and give evidence objecting
to the granting of the license. If the
objection is upheld an appeal can be made
to the Arbitration Court within 21 days.
Full conditions under which the business
may be carried on are set out in a depart-
mental pamphlet (copy posted).
What is the virtue of zinc white as com-
pared with white lead? —1161.
Every few years there is a lead-poisoning
scare, and one is in progress at present.
Various (Governments have prohibited the use
of white lead in painting, and the N.S.W.
Education Department, under Ministerial
instruction, lately changed over to zinc white.
The International Labor Office at (Geneva
strongly condemns the use of white lead
without precautionary measures.
Would it be legal if a husband willed his
remaining property to another than his
wife, he having already by deed given his
wife twice as much as he now wishes to
leave to another (at the husband’s death
the wife will also get lialf the pension he
now draws ) ? —1239.
To dispose of your property as you pro-
pose would not invalidate your will, but in
N.S.W. the Testator’s Family Maintenance
Act (1916) provides that where any person
disposes of his property either wholly or
partly by will in such a manner that his
widow is left without adequate provision
for her proper maintenance, the Court may,
taking into consideration all the circum-
stances of the case, on application by or on
behalf of the wife, order that such provision
for her maintenance as the Court thinks
just shall be made out of her deceased hus-
band’s estate.
We are troubled with a plague of fleas.
Hoto can I get rid of them? —l249.
Spray the soil under and about the house
with a solution of kerosene and kerol in
equal parts diluted with 100 parts of water.
Common mint is an excellent flea banisher.
Crush the fresh leaves and strew them along
the clothes in cupboards, between the sheets,
under carpets, etc. Essence of peppermint—
much the same thing, . of course —is also
good, but more expensive. If fleas are known
to abound in a certain room, place several
flypapers flat on the floor of the room, and
put a small piece of freslily-cut raw meat
in the middle of each. The fleas will hop
towards the meat and stick on the papers.
Recipe and instructions for brewing beer
with a kick in it? —1287.
One: Water, 5 quarts; hops, 6oz. Boil for
3 hours, strain and add water 5 quarts,
bruised ginger 40z., and then boil a little
longer, strain and add sugar 41b., and, when
milk-warm. lpt. yeast. Allow to ferment and
bottle in 24 hours. Another: Hops 50z.,
water Bgals., brown sugar 241 b., yeast 3 or
4 tablespoonsful. Boil hops and water to-
gether for 45 minutes, add sugar, and when
dissolved strain into bowl or tub. When it
is lukewarm add the yeast, let “work” for
48 hours, skim well and strain into bottles.
Cork well and allow to stand a while before
using. The kick can be acquired by the
simple process of keeping at about 45° centi-
grade till the yeast ferments the sugar and
produces alcohol.
Is there a cure for baldness? —l24l.
Of course, claims have been made, but this
department doesn’t know one of general appli-
cation. Sudden acute baldness is some-
times cured by thyroid extract. The ordi-
nary baldness is alleged to be held in check
by acet. cantharidis, 2 drachms; acid, acetic
glacial, 1 drachm; sp. rosmarini, 20z.; aqua
ad. Boz. To be rubbed into the hair roots
daily. Baldness in young people (Alopecia
areata) often cures itself.

J&nAE4~ ave played for the AMPICO
C /MMy® because of its absolute faithfulness.
PONDER this declaration of the great Russian pianist! Better still, consider the
deep import of the whole of his letter which is printed above! This statement
of Rachmaninoff means definitely that he was unwilling to record 'Tor any reproduc-
ing piano.” He was unwilling that his work should be judged by any repetition
which but thinly shadowed forth the magnificence of the original performance. Then
he met the Ampico and, in gratitude, he eagerly seized so rare and wonderful an
opportunity for the perpetuation of his playing.
In effect he says of the Ampico: "This is Rachmaninoff. Whatever I can do, it will
repeat. Whatever I have done, it will do—for ever!” There was never a finer
tribute. It comes from a great master, jealous of his reputation and keenly anxious
that contemporaries and those to come, shall know him as he really is !
Testimony equally definite and convincing, has been written by other world-famous artists who perform ex-
clusively for the Ampico—notably Moisiewitsch, Ornstein , Levitzki, Goclowsky, Strauss , Schmtzer, D’lndy and others.
BEALE-AMPICO
The Ampico is associated only with the world’s greatest pianos—instruments possessing the rich tone, great volume and
fine subtlety of expression vital to Ampico re-enactments. In Australia, the BEALE-AMPICO is the worthy repre-
sentative of this group of celebrities.
The World's Music at your Command
The music of all the world is yours to command through
the Beale-Ampico : This wonderful instrument will play
for you sonatas, r. ,-cturnes, operatic selections, serenades
and fantasies; simple songs and ballads, hymns, marches,
dance music, jazi. The most modern selections beside
the musical treasures of generations.
You must hear the Beale-Ampico —■
for without hearing it you cannot appreciate the marvel of its performance.
We invite you to hear the Beale-Ampico at our George Street Showrooms,

The Mercantile Mutual
Insurance Company Limited
The Forty-ninth Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders was
held at the Company’s Head Office, Martin Place, on Thursday, Aug. 1 1.
In moving the adoption of the Report and Balance Sheet the Chair-
man referred to the Company’s experience during the financial year
ended 30th June, 1927, as follows:
THE PREMIUMS received, after deducting reinsurances and return
premiums, amount to £428,008, compared with £395,014 for the
previous twelve months, which may be regarded as satisfactory. The
increase was chiefly derived from the Workers’ Compensation Act which
came into operation Ist July, 1926.
The ratio of EXPENDITURE shows a decrease compared with
previous years, and is partly due to the larger premium income.
TAXATION, including rates and compulsory contributions to Fire
Brigades, total £2 7,922, being about 6| per cent, of the net premium
income.
LOSSES paid and in process of assessment total £245.024; they
are higher than hitherto experienced, and are partly due to an abnor-
mally high proportion of fires that occurred during the summer months,
principally in the country districts of New South Wales. From evidence
produced by a Royal Commission appointed to investigate the cause of
bush fires it was proved that some of the most serious were the result of
carelessness and even recklessness on the part of individuals. If the
recommendations by the Commission are carried out the risk of a recur-
rence of similar disasters may be reduced.
THE SURPLUS for the year, after making full provision for all
possible contingencies, including an allowance for adjustment of
premiums received under the Workers’ Compensation Act and for the
Bonus payable to policyholders in the Fire Branch entitled to participate,
amounts to £51,012 4s. lid., of which sum £26,060 ss. was derived
from underwriting, being 6.1 per cent, of the net premiums, and
£24,951 19s. 1 Id. from income from investments.
THE RESERVE FUND has benefited by the surplus gained through
the sale of the Head Office property and by the premium from the issue
of new shares; with those additions and with appropriations now recom-
mended the Reserve and Contingent Funds have been increased to
£215,954 14s.
THE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL has been increased to £445,000,
and the paid-up capital to £333,750, which, added to the Reserves,
make a total of £549,704 14s. In addition there is the Uncalled Capital
of £l 1 1,250; in all £660,954 145., being more than 154 per cent, of
the net premium income.
TAXATION: In addition to an increase in State Income Tax, an
amendment of the Fire Brigades Act of New South Wales requires pay-
ment to be made by the Insurance Companies of one half of the cost
of the up-keep of the Fire Brigades, in place of one-third hitherto paid.
The total contribution paid to Fire Brigades by your Company during the
year amounted to £13,202, compared with £9981 last year. There will
also be a further charge to be met in respect to Family Endowment,
which I estimate at about £l6OO. The extraordinary fact is, that, while
this tax is demanded, not one member of the Staff at Head Office will
benefit from the Act. Some people entertain the view that Insurance
Companies are comprised of wealthy persons: in reality, a large portion
of the capital consists of the savings of persons of moderate means. The
shares of your Company are held by 986 proprietors, with an average
holding of paid-up capital amounting to £338 10s., and there are
instances where the Share Capital is even wider spread, evidence of the
fallacy that in taxing companies the burden will fall only on the rich.
While taxation, salaries and every other charge in recent years has
increased, accompanied by a higher ratio of losses, the fire premiums
since pre war have remained practically unaltered, and have proved to
be inadequate; much consideration has been given the subject by commit
tees of Underwriters, and, as a result of searching investigation, it was
decided to discontinue payment from Ist July last of the customary
bonus on risks that experience has shown to be unprofitable.
THE WORKERS’ COMPENSATION ACT OF NEW SOUTF-1
WALES has been in operation for 1 2 months, but the experience gained
is quite insufficient to decide whether the present reduced rates will meet
the obligations accepted by the Insurance Companies undertaking the
risk and leave a reasonable margin of profit; it will require several years’
practice before the position can be determined.
REAL ESTATE: Reference was made at our last Meeting to the
pressing need for increased accommodation at Head Office, and with
this end in view the Directors had acquired a suitable site at 1 1 7 Pitt
Street, where a modern building will be erected on plans prepared by
Messrs. Robertson and Marks. A contract has been settled with Messrs.
J. C. Harrison and Son for the erection of the building, which will provide
for present needs and future requirements; in addition to supplying 20,000
square feet for the Company’s use there will be the space of about
42,500 square feet available for leasing. It has also been found neces-
sary to purchase property at Adelaide and Hobart for accommodation
of the Branches in those cities.
The late MR. R. J. ALCOCK: It is with profound regret that 1
refer to the loss sustained through the death of Mr. Alcock, who was
Chairman of the Victorian Board for 26 years and gave valued assistance
and consistent support to the Company throughout that period. Mr.
James M. Gillespie, who has also been a loyal and influential Director
for a similar term, has now been appointed Chairman of the Local Board.
IN CONCLUSION, let me again appeal to Shareholders for their
loyal support by placing their own business, large or small, with the
Mercantile Mutual, and in encouraging their friends to patronise their
own Company. By fostering Australian institutions you add to the
prosperity of the. Commonwealth.

Under the Whip
Good horses are beginning to step into the
motor-vans which nowadays carry thorough-
breds to the Sydney courses (the Railway
Department is getting less and less of this
traffic), and platers are leaving for the pad-
dock or bush meetings. For this punters
give thanks —the erratic plater has been a
sore trial for months. Many Epsom, Metrop.
and Derby candidates were among the
starters at Rosehill on Saturday. Although
Persuasion had the steadier of lOst. 131 b.
in the Highweight Handicap, six furlongs,
she Avas the public’s first choice (at fours),
but she looked a bit ragged and took no part
in the finish. That Avas fought out by
Bravado (5 to 1), Triplex (14 to 1) and
Prometheus (10 to 1), the English horse
beating Triplex by half a length. Both came
from a long way back, and the ring Avas
rather more impressed Avith Bravado’s per-
formance, judging by the Avay it shortened his
Epsom price; but Triplex's exhibition was
full of merit. Bravado is in the Epsom Avith
Sst. Triplex has 7st. 71b. in the Epsom and
7st. 51b. in the Metrop. There was 51b.
between them on Saturday.
Merry Mint’s Derby chance Avas not highly
valued after his display in the Three-year-old
Handicap. Six to four in a field of 23, and
more forward than most of his antagonists,
he was fairly and squarely beaten by Prime
Don (14 to 1) and Chromium 1 25 to 1),
the seven furlongs being traversed in lmin.
27£soc. But he did not actually fail on the
score of stamina, and, being a grandson of
Spearmint, he is more like to stay the Derby
distance than Prime Don, a Sarchedon, or
Chromium, a Chrysolaus. Glenariff (Valais
—Bunee) is a fine big fellow, but reports
that he had done a lot of good work were
not borne out by his showing in the race.
_. ..* , * ‘ ‘ „.
Fuji San s brother, Valparaiso (4 to 1),

Certain big punters were waiting for the
French horse Rionscup (Teddy—Primrose
Lane), and they were accommodated with
some substantial wagers on the Carlingford
Mile at 11 to 8 and 5 to 4. A handsome
and high-spirited bay, he was always w-ell
placed and came away from Beedos (7 to 1)
and Nan Korngan (20 to 1) when loohey
let him have his head. It was a stylish per-
formance, even though the field w-as not high-
class nor particularly anxious in some
eases, and the foreigner is now one of the
favorites for the Metrop., in which he has Sst.
101 b., being quoted at the same price as
Limerick (9st. 51b.) and Amoums (9st.
31b.). Of course, either of those horses
would have made hacks of the lot Rionscup
beat with 9st., which was all lm carried.

THE BLACK SHEEP.
SKIPPER: “Now then, don’t, say your flamin’ prayers—get back to the Sold!”
With Spearfelt, Metellus. Don Moon,
Piastoon and other good performers having
an outing, class was AA r ell represented at
the V.R.C. meeting at Fleming ton on Satur-
day ; and there were some very exciting
finishes. But it Avas a day disastrous to
punters. Don Moon was backed at sevens
and better for the Apprentices’ Handicap,
six furlongs, Nepean being favorite at 3 to 1.
Nepean got the worst of the start, and the
race proved easy for Switzerland (7 to 1),
now owned by Dr. Barry Thomson ; moving
away smartly from the favored outside posi-
tion, the black horse was in the van all the
way. He beat Nenean by a couple of
lengths, Numenia (25 to 1), Don Moon and
Marsias being close up. A lot of the Don
Moon money Avas Otway Falkiner’s. He
hadn’t a bob on his Seremond —Bombina
colt. Ragazzo (33.t0 .1), who Avon the Three-
year-old Handicap in a canter from Tel-
lustar (15 to 1) and Pitoota (6 to 1),
leaving the mile behind in Imin. 40£sec.
Ragazzo may not be a Derby colt, but he
has plenty of pace, as indeed he showed in
Adelaide last season ; and it will be a long-
time before he is friendless at 100 to 3
again.
There was another surprise in the August
Handicap. 10 furlongs; imported Bcppin-
san (34 to 1) shot past Llanthony inside
the distance and lasted long enough to
scrape home by a neck from Dukedom
(5 to 1), who was a length and a half clear
of Altimeter (5 to 2). The winner had stolen
a middle-distance race at the Valley, but
Flemington was supposed to be beyond her;
as a matter of fact, she ran the 10 fur-
longs in 2min. 5 (sec. By Rockflint—Amor-
osa, she belongs to Mrs. E. A. Widdis, and
A if Holloway trains her. The double-book-
makers had a “skinner” on the Hurdle and
Steeple, King’s Path (12 to 1) winning the
former and old Mailman (20 to 1) the argu-
ment over the bi timber. Bettors went

Of the older horses with engagements in
the spring handicaps, Piastoon did best. He
was running on well in fourth place at the
finish of the August Handicap; and he was
quite unbacked. The Melbourne Cup is his
mission, and Sst. 91b. is by no means a pro-
hibitivo weight.

Scobie took Gleamlight over to Adelaide
f or the Guineas, but the Comedy King colt,
j 1 f aV oritc though he was, failed ingloriously.

of the season for two-year-olds, and galloped*
the half-mile in 48$sec.—this though the track
was a bit soft. He is by Cyklon— Last Ray.
But the horse that made most impression was
Silvius, cattle-king Kidmap’s importation,
who easily outstayed Master Vibrator, Miss
Audrey and seven others in the Tennyson
Handicap, 13 furlongs, after Graham had
been obliged to pull him from the rails to the
outside. This four-year-old son of Silvern—
Addenda has only 7st. 51b. in the Caulfield
Cup (for which lie was a strong tip in
Adelaide weeks ago) and the same in the
Melbourne Cup—he carried Sst. 21b. on
Saturday. Kidman paid a lot more for him
than the average. Australian buyer gives for
an English horse.

It is a publication which The Bulletin
has always found useful, and no racing man
can afford to be without it.

“Jcobb”: In 1913. whilst on a visit to
Broome (W.A.), I collected on a horse called
Borine, who Avon the Flying Handicap with
12st. 41b. up. A ferv months ago the same
horse, ridden by the same jockey, won a
hack race at Darwin, carrying 12st. 21b.—
and I was on again. Nothing like it has
happened in my personal experience; still, I
daresay people in Perth could furnish
parallels. In that haunt of night trotting
there are pacers not yet retired from busi-
ness (Alfred Donald is one) that were racing
before the Avar.

“Adam”: In Kipling's story “The Broken-
Link Handicap” is this passage: “Shackles’
jockey Blunt was a well-behaved boy, but
his nerve had been shaken. He began his
career by riding jumping races in Melbourne.
where ;i few stewards want lynching, and
was one of the jockeys who came through the
awful butchery—perhaps you will recollect
it—of the Maribyrnong Plate. The walks
were colonial ramparts—logs of jarrali
spiked into masonry—with wings as strong
as church buttresses. Once in his stride a
horse had to jump or fall. He couldn’t run
off.” In England four years ago I wrote to
Kipling and pointed out that the Mari-
byrnong Plate was a flat race. He wanted
to know if it was always so.
“Kirkwall”: The recent death of the
Maoriland sire Martian has started the
racing statisticians off on their old game of
comparison. Not reckoning in the season
now commencing, Martian’s stock have won
£350,000, which places him easily lirst among
Australasian sires. Maltster comes second
with £308,424; then follow The Welkin,
£278,312; Comedy King, £205,01K); Linacre,
£264,000; Absurd. £250,0(Mi; Wallace,
£246,140; and Pistol, £210,528.
* *' « *
“Jack Point”: There is at least one man
in Brisbane who has no illusions as to
where the lion’s share of the money in the
racing game goes. He is Billy Byrne, who
trained horses for many years for the late
A. II. Whittingham. When that sportsman
died he left Byrne a nice little string of
horses sufficient to supply any trainer with
enough to keep him busy, if not rich. Billy
promptly sold the lot and swapped corn- and
chaff-bags for a bookmaker’s satchel. He
now fields at Ascot, and wonders why he's
been working all these years.
“Fyy”: An interesting point in regard
to the leasing of racehorses cropped up at
Rockhampton (Q.) recently. The lessee
missed the horse from his 1 stable, and later
located it in the lessor’s premises; the latter
refused to give up the prad. The police
took a hand, but the lessor satisfied them he
had found the nag straying on the main road
“in a disgraceful and starving condition."
The Central Queensland Racing Association
was appealed to, but contented itself with
pointing out; that a lease registered by. the
association was binding on all parties. It
seems curious that officially-recognised leases
should not contain a clause compelling a
lessee to take proper care of a leased
animal. In the case of a house lie would
certainly have to covenant to that effect.
In the instance under notice, the lessor
refuses to return the animal to the other
party, whose lease does not expire for six
months.
Footbrawl
As in Hobart three years ago, Victoria
and Westralia contested the final of tin 1
“carnival” in Melbourne, Victoria getting
home by 13 points, after a great game. West
started in fine style and had 4 goals 5
behinds to 5 beliinds at the, end of the
first quarter. In fact, it led for the greater
part of the match ; scores were 5-6 to 3-13
in the second term, and 10-10 to 8-14 in
the third. But with the wind at their backs
the Vies, came with a rush in the final
quarter, and when a smart goal from Mori-
arty's boot gave them the advantage for the
first jtime in the match they did not lose it
again. At the end it was 85 to 72 (11-10
to 10-12). Hard knocks were given and
taken by both sides, but mostly in good part.
In the early match, South A us. defeated
Tasmania by 20-23 to 14-24. The atten-
dance, 40,454, was the biggest of tin* series.
Unbeaten Victoria finished the tournament
with 16 points, Westralia with 12, South
Aus. with 8, N.S.W. with 4, and Tassie with
0. The Speck team’s form was oddly in-and-
out ; it played an excellent game against
the Westralians and was perhaps unlucky
to go under by a point.
Carlton gave another fine display at
Erskineville, Sydney, before a crowd of 5000.
winning from a metropolitan side by 107
(16-11) to 50 (7-8). After the good show-
ing of Eastern Suburbs against Geelong in
the mid-week game at Hampden Oval it
was hoped that the combined team would
shake up the Blues, but the latter left the
opposition standing whenever they felt like
it.
“Rucker” : Sydney enthusiasts will be dis-
appointed at tlie decision of the Australian
Football Council to hold the next “carnival"
at Adelaide. Tasmania and South Aus.
sportingly backed a proposal in favor of
Sydney; it was the N.S.W. delegates who
objected on the ground that the expense
would be too heavy. Yet the big attendance
at the Geelong-Oarlton game demonstrated
that the Sydney public could be depended
upon to supporfcffifist-class exhibitions of the
code. The promising form shown by the
Sydney lads in“ Melbourne should have en-
couraged the League to take a risk, especially
as the result might be the establishment of
the code as a rival to Rugby. Unfortunately
the controlling body is afraid of its own
shadow.

RED FLAGS AND WHITE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From the high first tee in the morning
light
The long green fairway falls,
Its soft, sleek beauty stretching bright
A lure to the driven balls.
( >h ! we start away Avith our spirits high
And a clean. Avliite card to fill.
No pull nor slice nor nasty lie
The hope in our hearts can kill.
If we duff a shot, we have never a doubt
That the better strokes will come,
While the little red flags still beckon us
out
And Ave’re eighteen holes from home.
Though you pulled your third drive out of
bounds,
t As you put another ball down
You thought, “There’ll be time in a couple
of rounds
For Luck to lose her frown.”
The whole long game was ahead of you
And you knew you’d win in the end.
Ah ! That is the spirit to pull you through;
But there’s this to remember, friend,
That in all your playing, no matter how
Much skill you may have or lack,
Though the little red flags are luring now
There’ll be White ones coming back.
Oh! it gives you a shock when the ninth
you’ve won,
Though you haven’t played too well,
To see afar, where the fairways run,
A white flag set to tell
That you’ve turned the corner; the round's
half done.
Then you start to play your best;;
You take more care with your Avond, my
son,
Your mashie, and all the rest;
And you’ll cast your eye up your card, may-
bc,
To see how the tally stands—
When the last of the little red flags you
see
The Avhite ones steady your hands.
The way of life like a golf course rolls,
With many a dip and bend.
Though Ave do our dash at the first nine
holes
We play to win at the end.
And if when he’d played his eighteen holes,
One man won all the way,
There’ll be others there who would give their
souls
For the strokes they would replay.
And it’s much the same in life about;
The flags, for those who roam. . . .
The gay Utile red ones lead us out.
But the Avhite ones guide us home.

“Hotham”: The question of contributions
by the State Leagues to the funds of the
Australian Football Council roused lively
discussion at the meeting of that body in
Melbourne. More money is needed to push
the game in N.S.W. and Queeensland, and
increased contributions were asked for. It
was agreed to impose a 14 per cent, levy on
all net receipts, including membership tickets,
with a maximum of £SOO for Victoria, in-
stead of. £3OO as heretofore. South Aus.’s
maximum liability was fixed at £3OO, the
scale lessening for the other States to a
£5 for Queensland.
The Sydney Rugby League clash between
in-and-out Newtown and St. George resulted
in a very lucky win, 16 to 14, for the Illa-
warra men. Each side scored two tries, but
one of St. George’s was a gift owing to the
umpire’s view being blocked by huge masses
of brawn ; had he been in a position to see
what happened the player, Kelly, would have
been recalled for a knock-on. A splendid
penalty kick by Carstairs gave St. George
the deciding goal. Balmain, now in a win-
ning vein, just headed Western Suburbs, 7-5;
West sadly missed its iuter-State full-back,
McMillan. In the Glebe-East match Glebe
scored 4 tries to 3, but 5 goals from Oxford
—he also got a try—to 3 by Hickey put
East a point ahead. Oxford is having a
very successful season. At North Sydney
South, the competition leaders, spent a plea-
sant Saturday afternoon with the Shoremen,
winning by 24 to 11 —6 tries and 3 goals to a
try and 4 goals. Lapham, who is unusually
fast for a forward, scored 3 tries.
* :'= * *
The Rugby Union featured a match
against the Japanese XV at the Showground,
a middling metropolitan side beating the
tourists easily by 31 to 6. Lack of weight
handicaps the Waseda University men, and
ihe absence of a long reach was severely fell
by most of their players in the line-outs.
They showed good combination and handling
in the backs, but were not very fast. How-
ever, in Sakakuwa. a forward,’ Tnkigawa, a
centre, and Honryo,
the live-eiglitli, they
have some very likely
players. They are ex-
cellent sportsmen, as
the paying of then-
own expenses for the
lour and their scrupu-
lously clean play indi-
cate. No one will
grudge them a win be-
fore the tour is ended.
The last round of the
Great Public Schools
competition saw New-
ington unexpectedly go
down to Grammar by
17 to 6. As the other
two leaders, Sr.
Joseph's and King’s,
each won its final
match, the pair are
bracketed premiers.
Avith Newington second.
“F.S.” : A humorous
feature of the
Japanese exhibition 1
saw in Melbourne was
the strenuous endeav-
ors of the visitors to
overcome their natural handicap of lack of
inches by resorting to mass attacks, like
the Lilliputians who subjugated Gulliver.
The home team possessed in Abbott one of
the tallest forwards in the game, and he
spent most of the afternoon carrying about a
garland of struggling Nipponese. At times
half the team seemed to be hanging round
his neck. The tactics of the Japanese gener-
ally suffered from the same mistake. They
attempted aerial attacks at their opponents’
heads when they should have concentrated on
their feet. Japanese mothers will have to
eat a lot more meat and wheat before Nippon
can take its place amongst the Rugby nations
of the world. Those Western necessities are
alleged to have added a fraction of an inch
to the national stature already.
“Fritz v. Fullback”: The Germans are
requesting the honor of a visit from the
Waratalis after the latter have strafed Eng-
land and France. Since the Armistice,
Jerry has played Rugby at Oxford, and
even" Paris, the latter meeting ending with-
out a riot. True, the French won so easily
that they could afford to be affable. The
other fellow losing is apt to make us won-
drous kind.

In the Soccer knock-out battle for the
Gardiner Cup, St. George provided a surprise
by eliminating Eastern Suburbs, a goal to
nil. In the premiership competition, Glades-
ville-Ryde retained the lead by beating
Annandale-Leichliardt. 5 goals to 3; it now
heads Balgownie by 3 points.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Johnnie Squires, of Boerland, who was
rushed with offers of fame and fortune in
Australia a few hours after he had got his
second verdict over George Cook, has had
another fight at the Sydney Stadium. On
July 23 the Afrikander was well beaten by
“Sunny” Jim Williams, although the referee
made it a draw. About eight o’clock on
Saturday night “Tiger” Payne was seen
handing out bales of notes to white sporting
gents., with instructions to get on at any
price; and the coon became favorite at 6
to 4 on. He kept the paleface waiting for
fully five minutes; but when he did arrive
lie wasted no more time. He rushed over to
the Boer's corner and let fly with both fists,
some of his punches landing on the body
and others on the arms and shoulders. The
big crowd was on its feet, and the roar of
the terraces could have been heard at South
Head. After the round had gone 2min.
40sec. a terrific right took effect fair on the
jaw, and the white tower was flat on its
back in dreamland. Payne was so sure of
the thoroughness of his job that lie walked
to his corner, scarcely deigning a glance
at the prostrate white, and Wallis had to
follow when he’d finished counting Johnnie
out. Squires did not land one serviceable
punch. Weights: Payne, 12st.; Squires,
12st. 81b.
“Mafisli”: Anew terror has been added
to the game of stousli. When one “Taff”
Jones encountered a mere Australian named
Tommy Swift at Cessnock (N.S.W.) on
Saturday night the former’s Welsh supporters
assembled in force and sang “Land of My
Fathers.” Swift wilted under the strain and
was beaten on points. That sort of thing
may serve its turn while “Taff” looks for
lash among the native-born only. But wait
till he meets a Kelly from Cork or a Sullivan
from the Wicklow Hills!

Months of clever publicity culminated in
Ted Thye (12st. 41b.) and Sam Clapham
(12st. 61b.) splitting the purse of their
EASY.
FRIEND: “’Struth! ’Ow are we goin’ to get it ' om[?]?"
ENTHUSIAST : “'S all right. I've got plenty of empty pockets.”
lives at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
night. As the interesting pair made their
way into the ring, the ropes of which looked
like barbers’ poles, gazing anon at the huge
crowd, their hearts must have glowed. Despite
the fact that Ted had to gain a clear-cut
victory on falls before the “championship”
could become his once more, he was at 2 to 1
on in the betting. From the start it was
slow, cautious wrestling, with Ted going for
wristlocks and Sam for body-scissors. In
the fourth round Thye secured a leg hold,
which Sam countered with a headlock; each
hung on grimly and neither scored. It was
terribly tame until the ninth spasm, when
Ted brought the Yorkshireman down heavily
with a back heel and arm roll and had Sam
tapping in lmin. 6sec. It proved to be the
only fall. Thye left the ring draped in the
flag of his country to the strains of “The
Star-spangled Banner,” but the enthusiasm
was not so marked as on a similar occasion
last year, when the crowd averred emphati-
cally and inharmoniously that Britons never
would be slaves.
“F.S.”: Melbourne's wrestling boom has
resulted naturally in bringing forward more
promoters eager to dip their _ caps in the
golden stream, and “champions” of one sort
and another are arriving by every immi-
grant steamer. One Santel. a shaggy Ger-
man-American, has blown in with a claim
to be the champion light-heavyweight of the
world, and McArthur, J., has been asked. to
adjudicate between him and the other claim-
ants to the title. His Honor, after hearing
what the various writhing gentry had to
skite, came to the sensible decision that
deciding whether, in the opinion of the press
or the spectators, somebody or other is a
greater wrestler than someone else was
not his business. Also he hinted that the
court was being used as good publicity by
all concerned, which is about the truth.
Racquet and Bawl
The Queensland lawn-tennis champion-
ships were mostly annexed by N.S.W. visi-
tors. Jack Crawford and Kalins were left
in the final of the singles; the youngster, out-
staying lvalms, took the honors: 9-7, 3-0,
6-3, 6-4. Moon and Hopman, both greatly
fancied, were knocked out in the early games.
Jim Willard, with a Queensland partner in
L. Thurlow, won the men’s douoies, Dealing
Kalms and Cummings in the concluding
tussle, while the Misses Meaney and Cox
took the women’s doubles from the Queens-
landers, Mrs. Roe and Miss Mitchell. The
singles, however, went to the Queensland
captain, Mrs. Molesworth, who beat Miss
Cox: 9-7, 6-3. Gerald Patterson was too ill
to appear. This was regrettable, for a meet-
ing between the Davis Cup player and (’raw-
ford or Moon would have been worth seeing.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: It has been announced
in England that the Australian Lawn Tennis
Association will permit Suzanne Lenglen to
play with or against amateurs when Suz-
anne visits this country in 1928. So that
settles it—unless a dispute arises over terms.
* * * =l=
“Fault”: By beating Canada, three rub-
bers to two, Japan lias qualified to meet
France to decide which nation shall tackle
the Americans for the Davis Cup. Yoshiro
Ohta downed Crocker in the first singles
match, three sets to one, but Wright evened
matters by beating Harada in straight sets.
Then Harada and Toba took the doubles
from Wright and Crocker: 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 3-6,
10-8. In the second singles positions were
reversed, Wright outing Ohta and Harada
accounting for Crocker, both matches in
straight sets. The American team for the
challenge round will be: Tilden, Johnston.
Hunter and Williams, with Doig and Lott
as emergencies.
The Nineteenth Hole
The Victorian amateur golf championship
has passed to 18-year-old William Edgar,
who learned the game as a caddy on the
Oakleigh course, where the championship
was played. He beat Alec Russell by one
up, halving two holes, including the last,
where he had to square to win. He got down
a nasty putt to do it, a feat which says
a lot for the youngster's nerve and tempera-
ment. He is only a nine-stoner, and his
staying power through the 36-hole final was
remarkable. With the exception of I). Carr,
Queensland open champion in 1926, Edgar
is the youngest golfer to annex a title of
such importance—in Australia, at least.
(Continued on page 7/2.)
Tlie Vic. foursomes championship went to
A. W. Jackson, who lias twice won the
Australian open foursomes —in 1925 with
11. R. Sinclair and the following year with
Alex. Russell. This time Jackson’s partner
was J. C. Sharp, the pair finishing two up
on F. J. Vernon and E. E. Schwartz.
"Mid-iron”: Most of the States having
cleaned up their championships, attention
turns to the contest for the Australian
‘“open” at Sandringham (Vic.) next month.
Ivo Whitton will be on hand to defend
his title, but recent defeats have sent him
out of favor; his Victorian rivals, Jackson
and Russell, are better fancied, to say noth-
ing of the new boy-cliampion, Edgar. It
looks like being a professional’s turn again.
South Aus. is very keen on the chances of
Rufe Stewart, who was runner-up last year.
“iClaypan”: Brisbane golfers are again
swearing at municipal lethargy. Some time
ago the council promised to lay down a
municipal golf course, and with an ideal site
in hand in Victoria Park, within 15 minutes
of the centre of Brisbane, the scheme looked
home-and-dried. A special committee of
golfers inspected the ground'and reported
that, besides being eminently suitable, it
would be inexpensive to lay out. Then the
council blandly remarked there would be n<»
money till next year, so the golfers find them-
selves once more stymied. The only folk to
rejoice will be a few stray cows, and the
lovers, and the latter don’t use lb" park in
the daytime, anyway.
“Colonel 1 himutize”: I hate to say it, but
there is a vulgar spirit of irreverence abroad
when golf is being discussed. Only the other
day a Sydney daily published a leading
article in which it referred to some cricket-
ers as reaching that age “where golf merci-
fully claims them.” As a matter of fact,
golf is essentially a game for the young, ns
the world has begun to recognise. The small
percentage of veterans who linger in the
first class of players are only there because
the game has rejuvenated them. Edgar, Vic-
torian amateur champion, is only 18. Nettle-
fold, Australian amateur champion, is riot
yet of age ; and there are a dozen other
instances lying ready to hand. The writer
of the article referred to has fallen into the
common error of confusing the man who
plays the game with the man who talks
about it. The veteran, pushed off the fair-
way by youth, naturally falls back on play-
ing with his mouth instead of the clubs, the
mastery of which has escaped him. The un-
initiated obser er, accustomed to politicians,
naturally mistakes the big noise for the big
performance, and slips into error, and even
blasphemy.
* * * *
“Humpybong”: In spite of its old-time
reputation for casualness, Brisbane has nowT-
adays a very close regard for the conven-
tions. A member of the Royal Queensland
(“lub angrily protested in writing against a
player being permitted to wear “shorts.”
The committee fell back on the usual
cowardly subterfuge of “no jurisdiction,”
and “shorts” will continue to outrage the
purist. What the latter would say to the
not uncommon Scottish custom of playing
with no trousers at all—kilts, of course,
are understood —St. Andrew’s only knows.
Car and Cycle
“Gate-change”: The gear-box is about the
only part of the modern motor-car which is
not entirely fool-proof. Therefore the an-
nouncement that an English device has been
perfected which makes a change of speed a
matter of sweet simplicity will be welcomed
by many. This is the attachment of a small,
free-wheel clutch between the tail-shaft of
the gear-box and the head of the propeller
shaft which is coupled to the ordinary clutch
mechanism. Depression of the clutch pedal
completely frees the gear-box shaft from
drive or over-run, with the result that
any gear, even reverse, can be meshed with-
out a sound, and without taking notice of
the engine speed. Then, when the clutches
are let in, and the throttle opened in the
ordinary way, the required gear takes up the
drive. A novice can change at high speed
from top to first, or vice versa, or use any
of the other gears, in or out of sequence.
The gear-box thus ceases to require any
skill on the part of the driver.
* *
“The Juice”: One of the English motor
trade journals has been conducting some
experiments with regard to the important
question of fuel wastage. These show con-
clusively that a great proportion of running
takes place at a small throttle opening.
The engine is not nearly so efficient as when
working at full throttle, with the result that
cars consume more fuel than should be re-
quired. Two remedies afc suggested: one
is the improvement of power transmission
by some substitute for the present wasteful
gear-box system ; the other is the improvement
and general adoption of the “super-charger”
system for temporarily increasing power
output for hill-climbing and acceleration.

“Rat-trap”: Harris Holder, the N.S.W.
eyelist. has won the sprint championship of
Goolidge’s republic. The contest was de-
cided on points gained in a series of 24
races; George Dempsey, also of N„ S. Wales,
was conspicuous in the early tests and was
hailed as a probable winner, but the other
Cornstalk was too much for him in the end.
Since Don Walker beat the great Zimmer-
maitii Australia has never been without
cyclists capable of holding their own in any
company. They have distinguished them-
selves abroad in all manner of events, from
quarter-mile dashes to six-day races ; Clarke.
Goal let. Grenda. McNamara, I’ye, Spears,
Corry and now Holder and Dempsey have
made track-cycling history.

“Ball Race”: Joseph Harris, dead in
Britain, is described as having invented the
“boneshaker" bicycle in 1867, when he was
only 20. This is not quite correct, for the
boneshaker proper, on which one sat astride,
using the feet on the ground to propel the
gadget, was very like the modern bike in
general outline; it came info vogue in the
Regency days, as contemporary caricatures
show. Harris's achievement was the high-
wheeler. over whose handle-bars so many
mid-Victorian youths dived headlong on to
the macadam. The boneshaker form was re-
vived in the “safety” bike of the 1880's,
with its chain drive. Then came cushion
and pneumatic tyres with the diamond frame,
and the bicycle, as we know it to-day, was
born.
* * *
“Gladiatcur”: France's Grand l'rix for
S5O c.c. motor-cycles has been won by the
well-known English rider Frank; Longman on
a Ycloeettc. The race is a long-distance spin
of 275 miles, and is run on a track. Though
the result is interesting as a speedway per-
formance, the true test of the motor-cycle’s
worth, and that of a car into the bargain,
is performance on the open road.
* * * h:
“Flat Tire” : Still another Australian motor
marathon record has been blown out —that
for the 1800-miles run from Fremantle to
Adelaide. The perpetrators were J. Muir
Thomson and Harold fjlutterbuck. In a
model 70 Chrysler tourer they left Fremantle
at 1 a.m. on a Tuesday, and clocked in at
the Adelaide G.P.O. at 3.12 a.m. on the
following Friday. The run took 12 hours 2.1
minutes off the previous best.
'/ * * *
“Chevroford” : Perhaps, the tin-hare craze
has something to do with the growing habit
of taking the drawing-room poodle or lap-
dog for a spin behind the car. It is a
fool-habit, anyway, and cruel, if not danger-
ous. The other Sunday, miles- from any-
where, I was just missed by a car whose
fair driver, as I presently noticed, was cast-
ing fond and anxious looks behind. About
live minutes afterwards a ball of dust and
perspiration, which may have been an Aus-
tralian terrier, tore past—comparatively
speaking. And that wasn't all. Several
minutes later one of those dejected-looking
sooners with two feet of body to three inches
of leg came panting in pursuit. A little
silver bell banging from a ribbon at its neck
tolled a miserable SOS to an indifferent
world.
Miscellaneous
"Capricorn”: One of the successful fea-
tures of the recent Brisbane Show was the
billygoat racing brought down from Rock-
hampton and other remote parts. The
elaborate racing spiders and the care and
concern shown by owners and trainers tor
their hopes were a revelation to Brisbane
people. And they play the game for keeps,
too. One youngster reported his suspicion that
his goat had been “doped.” Asked for proofs,
he led the stewards to his goat’s stall and
pointed out some empty starch and jelly
crystal packets lying on the floor; these, he
said, had been fed to his charge during his
temporary absence. However, as Boronia
Billy started in the last race and was only
pipped by a short nose the stipes reckoned
there was nothing much in it, and no one
was invited to tread the carpet.
* ;l> * *
“Long Dog”: The tin-bare frenzy seems
to have fairly taken England by the wool.
Thirty-two dog-racing cos. have been regis-
tered since January, and the latest has just
paid £150.000 for the stadium at Wembley.
The craze will probably die as quickly as
it has developed. There is precedent for
thinking so, too. for it has been discovered
that the “sport” was tried at Hendon, near
London, as long as 50 years ago. Monotony
is its chief drawback as a spectacle, and the
monotony of losing money will sicken the
“mugs.”
* * ❖
“Spike”: George Hyde put up another
good performance on Saturday in the, \ ic.
five-miles cross-country event on Moonec
Valiev racecourse; he won by 500 yards in
27min 251 sec., and could have bettered these
figures had ho boon extended. At Victoria
Park, Sydney, Alleyn Gainsford won the 10-
miles championship of his State for the
fourth year in succession. The time, 51min.
4!),sec., was so good that a chock was taken
and the course found to be nearly TO(M) yards
short. The A.A.A. official responsible for
the blunder ought to he compelled to run
the full .10 miles himself with Gainsford on
his back.
“Der Jong” : Arthur Newton, the English
distance pod., now in Rhodesia, is reported
to have run 00 miles in 7 hours ,\>.‘> minutes
55 seconds, lie is credited with having done
50 in 5 hours OS minutes 42 seconds, so lit'
must have dawdled over the last 10 miles,
even if he did heat the previous best by
nearly 50 minutes. Newton now claims
records for all distances from 50 to 100
miles. lb? is welcome to the dreary honors,
as far as I am concerned.
“Amateur Pro.": The dear old amateur-
status question has started a row which may
smash up the next Olympiad unless someone
climbs down. The International Olympic Com-
mittee kicked over the beehive by announcing
that competitors at. Amsterdam would be
entitled to a cash indemnity for earnings
lost during their absence from work. Appa-
rently this specially applied to Soccer foot-
ballers, but every class of competitor is
automatically included. The International
Amateur Federation, supreme authority on
amateur sport, has issued a general warning
that anyone accepting the indemnity will
forfeit liis or her amateur status. Put
the thing goes further than that, for any
amateur competing against or with any
recipient of the indemnity will automati-
cally become as black as the interior of a
tar-barrel in a moonless midnight. As a
result, it is on the cards that England,
France and America, to name only three
countries where the amateur status is a
solemn thing, may withdraw their mtries
unless the Olympic committee’s ruling is
cancelled.
“S.T.S.” (Loud.): The next. English XI
looks like relying on the letter 11 more than
ever, and filling up with S. Hammond is
one of the hopes of the future; llearnc is
back at his stodgy best; Holmes has helped
Sutcliffe to shatter an old llayward-and-llobbs
record; and Hallows’s claims arc strong.
Hammond, llearnc, Holmes and Hallows
have been more prominent this season than
even Hobbs and Heudrcn. Then there is the
aforesaid Sutcliffe, with Sandham. Shepherd
and the inexhaustible Strudwiek, all of
Surrey. And among the amateurs the most
likely in sight (after Chapman) are llaig and
Stevens.

“Tenth Slip” : While Australia is export-
ing cricketers to England and importing
English players to fill their places, Maori-
land is not. lagging behind. The Canterbury
COLIN STEPHEN, Chairman of the
A.J.C., renowned in the racing world
for his white “topper’ and his true
sportsmanship.
association is bringing out Newman, the
Hampshire bowler, and the MR. body is
securing A. A. Wilson, of Yorkshire. The
greatest care should be taken not to confuse
the latter with the liighly-superiah Hockley
(pronounced "Rock-leal)”) Wilson, also of
Yorkshire, who, with Percy Fender, so
endeared himself to our low all ordahs during
his visit to Australia in 1920-21. Rockleah,
when last heard of, was sports mastali at
Winchestah : but it must not be thought tor
a moment that lie would accept an engage-
ment as a common coach, especially in "the
colonies.”
"Popping Crease": Since the passing of
\V. CS. Grace, the veteran in years has largely
vanished from big cricket. Wilfred Rhodes
is one exception ; another, not so well known,
is the diminutive W. G. Quaife, who, at 35, is
still playing for Warwickshire. When in Aus-
tralia in 1901-02 Quaife was rated as a high-
class batsman of the steady professional
type. He was not very successful, however,
S. COVENTRY, Collingwood's captain , who
was injured last week when playing for
Victoria against Tasmania.
against Austral.inn howling, for his 13 Test
innings in this country and Britain aver-
aged only 19 runs each, with a highest
score of 08, though he has scored 70 centuries
in iirst-class cricket. Reversing the Rhodes
precedent, lie turned to the ball as time went
on and became one of his county's stock
bowlers. His 4 for 39 against a strong
Surrey side last week brought him a touch
of the old limelight again.
“Centurion”: Following its usual prac-
tice, the N.S.W. Cricket Association has
ordered its delegates to the inter-State con-
ference to he held in Sydney in September
to vote against Victoria’s proposal that the
follow-on by a team 200 runs behind on the
first hit be made compulsory. It is a foolish
instruction. The old rule of a compulsory
follow-on was a spur to both sides. The
( ptional business increases objectionable
features of modern cricket in Australia —
the tendency to put batting averages before
all. else, and to spin the games out to inordi-
nate length for the sake of the “gate.” It
is possible under the present rule for one side
to make 300 and the other 50. There is
nothing to prevent the strong batting side
from going in again and “starring” its crack
batsmen for the sake of the extra offertory.
Indeed, something of the sort happens every
season.
“Mid Off”: The N.S.W. Cricket Associa-
tion continues to deal out wallops to its
one-time josses. Warren Bardsley’s candi-
dature for a place on the State selection com-
mittee was turned down last week, though
few men arc better fitted by temperament
and experience for such a job. R. L. Jones
was re-cleetod, the other successful candidates
being E. L. Waddy and Andy RatclifEc.
Waddy and Ratcliffc are active players.
The ideal selector should be free to visit
any game, auywliere, at any time, without
being tied down to weekly matches.
“Jack Point”: An inquiry from a cus-
tomer as to whether our store sold the
materials for playing “house” brought memo-
ries. Most A.I.F. men know that, it wasn’t
much of a game, but it helped to make
English war-time beer taste a little less like
disliwater. With a keeper that knew how to
roll out his numbers one had to be sophisti-
cated to follow the thing. “Kelly’s eye”
(1), “medicine and duty” (9), “legs---
eleven,” “thirteen—the Devil's own,”
“twenty-two—all twos,” right up to “ninety”
—the top of the Wazir,” interspersed with
the information that “the old man dips
again,” made the game, which was generally
for a “penny single line” or “twopenny full
house”: that made the odds about 30 to 1. or
sometimes better, according to the number of
players and whether the “old man” kept with-
in the prescribed percentage of profit. Com-
pared with crown and anchor, “under and
over” and a few others, “house” was pretty
woeful, but one could enjoy it, in the canteen
with the comfort of a fire and he within the
law. The crown-and-anchor joints were prac-
tised on the “outer,” as it were.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Kerys” • There is no need to go to London
for rubber-paving. In George-street. Sydney.
the footpath in front of the big lerdiiau
shop has been rubber-paved for four years,
and no pedestrian fails to appreciate the
comfort of that resilient and noiseless length
of footpath. ...
“Chilblain": Perhaps the smallest trade
union in the world is the -Christchurch
(M.L.) Municipal Garage Employees Union,
membership five. The head of the union
points out that their award is £5 Bs. t>d. per
week, as against the £4 19s. tor ordinary
garage employees. ... ...
“Coot" : The records of the Commonwealth
Treasury show that £lO,OOO of the Common-
wealth ioan which matured in 192.1 remains
unclaimed by casual Australians, while of
the 1925 loan nearly £29,000 awaits its
owners. r J?hese untidy reninunts should be
cleaned up, and 1 hereby volunteer for the
job. ~ ... *
“Titun”: 1 bought blankets of excellent
quality which the salesman informed m->
were Australian made. But the trade-mark
was unfamiliar, and there was no sign of
maker or origin. Why not a uniform Made
in Australia” tag or imprint, and a con-
sumers' booklet containing a list of Aus-
tralian-made household goods !
“Riwaka”: Phrramatta (N SAW) has had
fame thrust upon it; it is in the short list
of places that have given their names to
woven fabrics, such as Mosul to muslin and
Calicut to calico. Funk and Wagnall s die-
i ionary defines “paramatta” ns a hind of
light-twilled dress-goods with cotton-warp
and filling of combed merino wool, and
states that the name is derived from “Parra-
matta, in Australia.”
“Baja”: Inspired by Buj.i.etin advts. 1
investigated the match-buying habits ot my
cobbers. In nearly every case they were
using foreign products, and for the most
part they had paid a penny per box at
tobacco or bookstall when they could have
bought the Australian article for 7d. per
doz. At home I found a packet ot Swedish.
My wife is a good Australian, but she didn t
insist on the grocer being the same.*
“Ibn el Issar”: Palestine is pushing on
with its scheme for harnessing the Jordan
in its sharply-falling course from Lake
Tiberias to the Dead Sea. The scheme, when
completed, is expected to revolutionise Pales-
tine, for the power available is so great as
to make possible electrification of all trans-
port* industry and irrigation in the country.
Complete afforestation is to he earned out,
with the Australian bluegum as the principal
vegetable. ...
“Herodot”: Despite the watchfulness of
health inspectors, there are many ways in
which the guileful Greek can brighten up
stale prawns and oysters. Prawns are
washed in water containing a small quantity
of spirit, and oysters are. bathed in water
containing glycerine. This gives them a
fresh appearance, which, however, does not
hist. And of course it is a poor chef who
does not know a dozen methods of rejuven-
ating fish. The shark snapper has to be bad
indeed before it is thrown out into the cold
world. _ *
“G.A.D.”: The publishers are playing
fancy tricks now. Colonel Lawrence's “Seven
Pillars of Wisdom,” which made its appear-
ance onlv a month or so ago. and the circula-
tion of which was limited to 100 .copies to
approved subscribers at £5O each, is already
changing hands at about £OOO. In the origi-
nal form of application it was necessary
to give a guarantee that the matter in the
book would not be subjected to public criti-
cism. Even then a completed, form, together
with a cheque for £3O, was liable to refusal
if the publishers were not satisfied as to
the identity of the subscriber. Ihe first
edition of Lawrence's “Revolt in the Desert,
intended as an abridgment of the £5O-volume
and published at a more or less moderate
figure, is now realising from £5O to £4O.
* * *
“T - Boggart” : Lancashire is growing nervy
because of a rumor that' Yankee cotton
will be 4.500.000 bales short on delivery this
season. Raw cotton has jumped 2d. on
Liverpool exchange—a quote in Tithebarn-
street is the standard for the cotton-growing
world. The British cotton-growing, scheme
in the Gezireli, between the 'White and
Blue Niles, will benefit; its production lias
increased enormously. Manchester has
decided that mills spinning American staple
shall shut down for the time being. That
spells hard luck for the rnillhands.. but it
emphasises the importance of setting up
machinery capable of dealing with the long-
staple Empire-produced cotton to supple-
ment that which lias been designed solely to
treat the great bulk of the American product.
The rise in price should assist Australian
growers next season.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-

SILK OR

That devotee to the welfare of women and
children. May Matthews, is back in Sydney
after what she describes as the most inter-
esting and the most “scheduled” six months
in her life. Miss Matthews was elected out
of a group of nominees to travel over
America as observer with the Australian
Industrial Mission. The mission visited
every big industrial centre in the U.S.A.,
making a careful study of conditions for
women in industry, particularly the workers
in factories. Taken all in all, she does not
think the woman worker of the States
enjoys happier conditions than her Aus-
tralian sister, though some of the model
factories have luxurious welfare departments.
Many keep a permanent medical staff, and
some are equipped with clinics for eyes and
teeth. The teeth of the American girl,
Miss Matthews says, are just about perfec-
tion.
Marriage does not turn an American
woman into a slave of the house. Equipped
with labor-saving devices that are sold at
small cost, the American housekeeper can
get through her work in a couple of hours,
so industry gives her the opening for “self-
expression”—and that’s her latest catch
phrase. Standard wages are practically un-
known—production governs a girl’s earn-
ings. The beginner earns about 12 dollars
(505.) a week, and after that it is “up to
her.” Of the 45,000 women in motor-car
making alone, of the spick and spanness of
the uniformed food packers (in some States
they are medically examined every six
months), of the intelligence of the American
woman, and of the excellence of the Y.W.C.A.
work for women, enough “observations”
have been made to fill a book.
Miss Matthews was in New York when
the tide turned against sex plays, and she
saw the triumph of Lindbergh, the unknown
young man from St. Louis, who in 33 hours
had become the associate of presidents and
princes. The young man in his quiet dignity
of manner and speech presents a bearing to
the world very similar to that of Australia’s
own Ross Smith.
Never again will visitors to the top floors
of The Bulletin offices be surprised by the
throbbing note of a ’cello or the drawn-out
sweetness of a violin, for “Hop,” who was
responsible for the sounds so unusual in a
newspaper office, has gone over the hill. But
Hop was not so much a musician, though he
handled his ’cello like a master, as a maker
of fiddles, little and big. There was, indeed,
no shape or make of stringed instrument that
the sensitive, beautiful hands could not
fashion. One of the earliest numbers of
the Lone Hand had an article, “From Cre-
mona to Cremorne.” in which the story of
Hop’s love apart from his pencil was told
complete with pictures. But there was no
type of cabinet-making and wood-carving in
which lie did not excel. Even as Time slipped
for him into Eternity, he was busy making
a clock for one of his favorite colleagues.
Hop leaves four daughters and one son.
Of the daughters one is Mrs. Homersliam.
the youngest is a brilliant musician and a
clever writer, another is a facile black-and-
white artist and a pupil of Julian Ashton.
The testimonial which is to be given to
Sister Marsden, of the Royal Hospital for
women, should have a host of willing sub-
scribers. That she has helped to bring 8000
Australians into the world with the loss of
only three of the mothers is a great thing,
but her unfailing kindness has been a greater.
Often she has dipped into her own purse
to help necessitous cases; and her spare
time has been spent in collecting money for
maternity causes—she has gathered £B5O for
the new wing of the hospital and has under-
taken to make it £lOOO. She had only one
son of her own, and him she lost in the war.
After 30 years’ service, she is shortly to
retire; the proposal is to provide her with
a cottage home for the years of her retire-
ment.
The Flying Ball! The name sounds like
a Chesterton fantasy. But it only signified
that the members of the Aero Club were
having a night’s jazz under arabesques of
jewelled lights in the high ceiling of the
Moore Park Palais. There was a rheu-
maticky aeroplane, too. that wouldn’t fly at
all. but fell to earth, revealing its passenger,
“Miss Round Australia,” in a chariot that
looked uncommonly like a wash-tub. The
new rival to Wackett’s Widgeon was the
Mascot Mugwump, and had been designed by
the club’s head inventor. This and the
club’s art publication, the Fi.y Paper, made
the most advanced case of bridgework ex-
pand in the smile of childhood. Flying
Force uniforms and medals and the new
season’s frocking put another sparkle into
the night, while the presence of vice-regals
added lustre. The Group-Captain P. F. M.
Fellow T es couple, here with the British Air-
ship Commission, were a distinguished
exhibit. The lady, who is small and blonde,
wore floating lilac georgettes that flashed
with rhinestones. Lady de Chair had allied
ostrich fronds, jade georgettes and the glit-
ter of diamente with a happy effect, and
Elaine smiled in radiance over wistaria-like
softness. The Hughes lady, impressive in
black velvets, against which an ostrich-
feather fan curled like a flame, stood beside
her knight during the vice-regal welcome.
Chief-Justice Street and Mrs. Street were
supports during this act, while others who
stood to attention where the Geoffrey Hughes
couple (Mrs. Geoffrey in georgettes of her
favorite green), vice-presidents, and treas-
urers and secretaries, each more gorgeously
arrayed than her neighbor. Iceland poppies
like flaming youth ran riot over the
vice-regal box, and a plane, _ jewelled
from end to end with electrics, hung
poised for flight above its entrance. _ The
Widgeon Wacketts were among the night's
persistent dancers; and 'Millie Sheldon’s
lilac georgettes and Isabel Fraser’s white
chiffons, that bloomed like a garden under
the sea with exotic coral horticulture, Rose-
mary Shepherd’s bright looks over black
frocking, and Flight-Lieutenant Garnet Mal-
loy's lady, in a grey satin Greek rhythm,
were among the night’s notables.
The cabaret octopus has thrown out
another tentacle and got the Moore Park
Palais in its grip. Of the 600 women
slightly dashed with men who danced gaily
and with long, free, jungle-like steps that
only the Palais space allows, all proclaimed
the jazz-run a great success. The after-
noon’s outing was one of the Sydney Hospi-
tal Auxiliary’s coin-raising efforts, and the
committee was of a tonnage rarely equalled.
Mayoress Mostyn came surrounded by
theatrical stars, among them Moscovitcli and
son ; Nat Madison, in another party, danced
Mrs. Mayne Linton; Matron Kellett, per-
fect in every dress detail, shone in another
group. Shingle-combs were a by-product
that found a quick sale.
Charles Westmacott is taking an interest
in this year’s Artists' Ball, and the artists
who are getting together groups for the big
fancy-dress pageant, which is to be a feature,
have been invited to help themselves to
costumes from the J. C. Williamson ward-
robe. Another feature will be cricket in
the basement inside nets; bowler Arthur
Mailey, with Oldfield at the wickets, will
invite all and sundry to come along and
defend the stumps for a few minutes. For
this occasion the work _ of preparing the
decorations has been split up amongst the
art students in the different classes in
Sydney. .
This pensive-looking lass is Joyce Simp-
son. one of the brilliant younger students
at the Conser-
vatorium. The

cher. Joyce,

the Con. tree

ing her atten-

timate fascina-
tion of cham-
ber mus i c.
From the last
examination in
this subject
Joyce gleaned
three honors
and a distinction; and that has merely
whetted her appetite.
The Aquatic Club and Provident Fund
for Limbless Soldiers will get a lift from
a happy party held at Dungowan the other
night. Over 200 dancers invaded the Martin-
place tearoom, seemingly all old friends, and
there was a battle of paper streamers that
was as vigorous as anything in .the Riviera
carnivals. There were exhibition dances,
too, and the organisers handed a posy of
new season’s flowers to Florence Aiktnan,
social organiser for the Limbless Soldiers’
Association.
David O’Rane, a retriever in the champ,
class, proved at the Animals’ Ball the other
night that dog doesn’t eat dog. On the con-
trary, he collected £5 to fill his lame brother’s
platter. Cats, Cheshire and Australian,
smiled broadly at one another in the frieze
above the Wentworth balcony, and Shirley
Bavin, who had again organised the
R.S.P.C.A. money-raiser, was radiant m
pink georgette frills. Sister-in-law-to-be
Marcia Allen, who kept the treasury with
Penelope Cay, wore lavender and silver.
Enid Falkiner and Betty Wilson were the
secretaries. Mrs. Oscar Paul and Mrs.
Alan Potter, two blonde goodlookers, glit-
tered in blue-green sequins.
This is Mrs. Swainson, wife of Y. Emma’s
new general secretary. The lady, who is
tall and a smart dresser, has the roses of
England in her
cheeks and a
twinkle in her
eye. Before
her marriage
she was princi-
pal of a girls’
college in the
North of Eng-
land, and be-
fore that she
was a B.A. of
Durham Uni-
versity the
o 1 d Norman
Castle and
Cathedral still
form part of
its pile. Very
beautiful and
impre s s i v e
abo v e th e
otherwise coal-
blackened town
stands the
Cathedral sheer above the river, and in the
old days when the marauding tartans flashed
over the Border it served as a house of
prayer. Two things have struck the Swain-
son family since its arrival in Sydney—our
deportment and our politeness. Mrs. Swain-
soii says she has never seen more smartly-
dressed girls anywhere; Mr. Swainson is
lyric over the tramway men ; and small-boy
Swainson loves the Sydney policeman—he
is so young and so obviously an athlete.
The Institute of Journalists, by courtesy
of the Royal Art Society, held a conver-
sazione in the midst of the R.A.S. show.
It was timed for Saturday night, and the
moments were crammed with music. Some of
the turns, particularly those from the Tivoli,
were very captivating. But members had to
sit glued to their chairs till the tea and
coffee circulated; then it was time to rush
for tram or ferry. New president Torn
Spencer beamed on his subjects, and Charlie
Bean was another whose hand was much
shaken. Mary Gilmore, too. One of the
best stories of the night was told by Bignold,
K.C. He was pleading for a prisoner before
Judge Jacob Cohen, who was very consid-
erate to counsel. But when the time for
sentence came, he biffed a stiff ’un to the
accused. Counsel shook his head sadly. “Ah,
your Honor,” he said, “the voice is the
voice of Jacob, but the hand is the hand of
Esau!”
John, T- R. Bavin’s eldest son, and Marcia,
youngest daughter of Arthur Allen (he’s of
Allen, Allen and Hemsley, and collects blocks
of land as a connoisseur collects antiques),
are to make a match of it. Marcia is an
attractive looking girl with a quantity of
dark, waving hair. The young man deals
in law. In this he follows not only his politi-
cal father, but also liis great-grandad, John
Phillmore Winchcombe, who before he arrived
in Victoria 80 years ago as a gold commis-
sioner had been called to the Temple. Grand-
father F. E. Winchcombe raised up the
house of Winchcombe, Carson and Co.
Grandfather Bavin laid up his treasure in
Heaven—he was a Wesleyan minister of
note.
Noel Byrnes, daughter of the house of
W. 11, Byrnes, of Forbes, looked indeed like
Christmas when she met Adrian Dudley
Cox. of the same towm, with view to mat., at
St. Philip’s On .Church Hill. Fragile pinks
and silver flecked the ivory-satin wedding-
garment. which ran to a silver-tissue train
flushed by its chiffon lining of palest pink.
An old lace veil was the something borrowed
without which no bride feels properly
equipped. One maid, Dorothy Broadbent,
also of Forbes, went about her task in hya-
cinth-blue velvets ; and the Wentworth, under
the direction of Mrs. Byrnes, stayed the
guests with flagons.
Petite, fair-haired Pauline Perier, who
gave a soft answer to Hilton It. Gordon in
Mosman Congregational Church, is a grand-
daughter of the dear old Monsieur who
once taught two-thirds of a former genera-
tion in Sydney the right way to say polite
things with a Paris accent. Numbers of
former naval officers wdio felt as if the sea-
fogs had mopped up their French conver-
sation were amongst this charming gentle-
man’s pupils in the days when he and
Madame lived in a pretty old-fashioned cot-
tage near Macleay-street. Pauline, only
daughter of the Albert Periers. of Mosman.
was a dainty mist-maiden in silver lace and
snow-white georgette on her wedding-day.
Did any other Australian ever call a
doctor from so far? When John Garvan was
very ill he talked of the specialist in Mon-
treal/ Canada, who had been called in to
see him when he fell sick in that city on
the way from London to Australia. He had
taken a great fancy to that doctor, he said,
and he wondered whether Professor Mills,
who had charge of the case here, wouldn't
like him in for a consultation. So many
times did the sick man return to this sub-
ject that at last Professor Mills sent to the
Montreal man and asked him if it was at all
possible for him to come to Sydney. The
Australian had so greatly interested him
that he at once made arrangements for carry-
ing on his practice, took the five days'
journey to Vancouver, caught a steamer,
spent a week in Sydney with his patient, and
was home again just inside three months.
To the R.A.S. has been born the happy
idea of a Spring Fair. The show will run
from September 27 to October I—the1 —the most
beautiful time of the year in Sydney—and
then so close to the A.J.C. meeting that it's
just like killing two birds with one
stone. Two special features will be inter-
state band contests and women’s industries.
Of course, horses and dogs and the flowers
that bloom in the spring will play their
parts, too.
The other- night the Wentworth was
like one of those fascinating scenes that small
girls behold when they look through a broken
"lustre.” All the lines of the spectrum were
massed together in high baskets spilling over
with the flowers of the spring, and balloons
arched the tables like a gay rainbow. The
brewer of this effervescence of color was Mr.
Williams, display-manager for Gowing
Brothers, and it was the big mercery firm's
staff that staged the whirl in aid of the
Children’s Hospital. Later in the night the
attractive baskets were eagerly bought as
souvenirs, and a tray of Australian wood
beautifully carved and polished by G. Fer-
guson. of the staff, w T as knocked down to an
eager buyer for £l4.
A gallant skipper trading to the Islands,
during a recent visit to Sydney, his home
port, mentioned to his wife an approaching
native wedding. She, good lady, went shop
ping, with the result that a length of white
net for a wedding veil, complete with orange-
blossom, was handed to the skipper for the
Island bride. As a specially intriguing gift
the lady added a crepe-de-Chine nightie.
Upon arriving with the purchases the skipper
discovered that in his absence another wed-
ding had been arranged. The veil was
easily dealt with —half to each bride. The
division of the orange-blossom was equally
simple. But the robe de nuit presented a
problem. Friends of the parties were con-
sulted, and the brightest of them suggested
a way out —that bride No. 1 should wear it
as a w-edding gown, and bride No. 2 should
claim it for the honeymoon.
Last week Mrs. G. D. Greenwood, wife of
the owner of Gloaming, christened her just-
published book, “Gloaming, the Wonder
Horse,” 'with a billy of tea at the Australia.
One wonders if the volume is in three parts
—“Gloaming: His Dreams, Triumphs and
Love Affairs.”
On October 14 there’s to be a Magic Notes
Ball. This hasn’t anything to do with a bank
or even with so-far-and-no-farther billets,
but is concerned with Soh-Fah-Me-Ray-Doli,
and is being organised by the Columbia
Gramophone (Australia) Co. as its contri-
bution to Hospital Saturday funds. The
date of the ball is that of the official opening
of the company’s Australian factory, and the
frivol will be a fancy-dress dance with a
difference—the sets and decorations will de-
pict the development of music and musical
instruments down the ages—from the blow
reed of the abo. to the quartet of Bertie
Kelly. Demonstrations of new inventions m
photographing sound will be among the
night’s attractions.
An Australian air-pilot shudderingly men-
tions it. Business in air-trips was brisk,
and he was just about to assist an eager
lady into the ’bus when he noticed some-
thing and declined to accept her as a pas-
senger. The lady was indignant, but the
airman was obdurate. When he heard later
that she had been rushed away in a motor-
car and that a new Australian had made
its appearance before hospital was reached,
he was glad of his obduracy, even as lie
marvelled at the casualness of the Aus-
tralian mother.
Mother being due for a birthday the young
thing had tried all the big booksellers for
a copy of “Jew Suss” without success.
Finally she espied from her tram a likely-
looking suburban bookshop. She popped
within and, smiling in an intoxicating man-
ner at the lady behind the counter, asked
if her stock held a copy of the book. The
attendant ran a thoughtful hand down the
back of her shingle. “.Tow Suss!” she mused.
Then she turned brightly to her shelves:
“Ah, yes, you mean a book on the Japanese
art of self defence!”
Belgium’s untiring Consul-General, Henry
Segaert, is about to produce still another
play. This time the performance will benefit
the French Alliance. The comedy chosen
is Labiche’s “Los Petits Oiseaux,” and by a
curious chance it is announced as “the
French plat. Les Petits Oiseaux.” St.
James’s Hall, on the 26th. will house tlm
performance, and the little stage will be in-
vaded by the period costumes of 1840.

ONLY a few hours from the sunny Para-
dise of the Riviera, which awaits Aus-
tralians who travel by a P. & O. liner
from September to January, winter sports
and Alpine climbing can be enjoyed to the
full, varied by visits to silver lakes, cupped
in giant slopes.
Ski-ing, skating, hockey, tobogganing, curling,
ice yachting, etc., afford glorious revelling.
And with these are stern gorges, tumbling
icy waters, pine-crested hills, and the keen,
clear, bracing air from the white-clad dis-
tance. Later at the right time the Australian
can cross the Channel to the fragrance of an
English Spring.

In spite of an icy breeze and a couple
of showers, there were a few whispers of
spring in the dressing at the VMI.O. meeting
£n Saturday, Really practical people stuck
to furs, cloth coats and felt hats, but. occa-
sionally a pretty silk gown peeped from
beneath heavy covering, with here and there
a lightweight coat or a white hat. Thelma
Halbert was one of those who dared the
weather, her lime-green suit and white furs
being topped by a white ribbon-trimmed hat.
M rs. Allan S powers, in beige coat and skirt,
biscuit-hued furs and felt hat, also struck
an optimistic note. Mrs. Lauchlan Mackinnon
helped to brighten the lawn with a com-
plete turnout of royal blue. Mrs. Henry
Rosenthal wore a black gown with a dash
of white, and a large black hat. Mrs. Oscar
Ireland was coated in reseda green with a
felt hat to match. Mrs. Hen Clmll'ey dis-
played a wrap of a new kind—-black with a
decorative design in nasturtium shade. Mavis
Carnegie’s fawn-and-brown plaid coat was
worn with a nigger velvet tam-o’-shanter.
Ruth Weston was in kolinsky fur with a
small felt hat.
The City Fathers and their womenfolk
had a night with "Sunny” at the Princess
last week as guests of Mayor Morcll and
his lady, who gave them supper at the Wind-
sor afterwards. It was the Mayor’s birth-
day celebration. Bronze gold with sable and
a harmonising bridge coat was worn by the
hostess, and daughter Sheila covered a filmy
amber-hued frock with a white fur coat.
Baskets of crimson camellias, pink roses,
daffodils and wattle decorated the supper-
tables. Alderman Jeffries, whose wife wore
black brightened with a sparkle of crystal,
expressed the good wishes of the guests.
Councillor Buxton’s wife was in black, with
red roses perched on the shoulder. Mrs.
Frank Stapley wore a chenille-embossed
orange-toned cape over a frock of mauve
georgette. Mrs. Ferguson, just back from
Europe, exhibited as a trophy a cream wrap
embroidered in opalescent sequins. Valuator
Steele’s wife chose gold tissue and lace and
Roma Smith’s good looks were enhanced by
a coral-pink gown. George Cuscaden and his
daughter, Mrs. Mayer and the Mortons were
there.
Flapperdom had a big night out at the
ball of the Catholic Ladies’ College in St.
Kilda Town Hall —it was a jubilee affair.
The 300 young folk looked charming in
the prettiest of frocks, taffeta playing a big
part. Balloons and decorations of yellow
and white roses, with gold and orange draper-
ies, made just the right background for de-
picture. Florrie Green, whose deep apricot
covering sparkled with crystal, directed the
programme. There was a pageant, headed by
Joan Stanley in a trailing robe of white and
silver, a grand march and a set of lancers,
in addition to the usual hops and steps. Arch-
gaiters Mannix cast an approving eye. Dr.
and Mrs. Maurice MacGillicuddy brought
their two daughters, Bill in a frilly frock of
heliotrope and Joan wearing mauve and pink.
The Lucini couple’s lasses. Tinker and Amy,
were in dainty frocks of taffeta, rose and
reseda green respectively. Annie Rose, presi-
dent of the Old Girls’ Association, was there
with the secretary, Monica Redmond, whose
green gown was patterned in chenille. Mollie
Rahilly wore pink and silver lace; and
Winnie Ryan chose an apricot frock with
sparkles.
Camberwell Grammar School pupils of
olden days jazzed at the Embassy one night
last week, president Dickinson and secre-
tary Fielding Russell heading the organis-
ing committee. Mrs. Buntine, wife of the
headmaster, was in silver tissue punctuated
with poppy red. Mrs. F. P. Derham wore
softly glowing pink, showered with crystal.
Mrs. H. Wood was a blue cloud with silver
trimmings. Lucy and Diana Murray, who
had with them a bevy of prettily-dressed
buds, were dancers.
Hawthorn Town Hall was filled one night
last week with folk wdio danced so that
the Tintern Girls’ School might have money
to buy sports prizes and to titivate the
grounds. Mrs. George Nicholson, wife of
the president of the committee, was in georg-
ette of autumn hues; Hilda Ball, head-
mistress of Tintern, had tracery of gold on
a black georgette gown ; Mrs. B. R. Gar-
diner’s gown of cosmos mauve was relieved
by silver lace; Maud Gibson, secretary of
the Old Girls’ Union, wore nattier blue
sprinkled with crystal: and Agnes Gardiner,
also in blue, added pink roses.
Dr. Sydney Crawcour gave a cinema show
at the Uni. the other night. He put on 2700
feet of Melbourne-made film, showing views
of the Uni. buildings, the Zoo, incidents tf
the Yorks’ visit, the English hockey matches
and racing and hunting episodes. Her Ex.
gave the proceedings her approval, and the
Uni. Musical Society’s orchestra played.
After the show Professor and Dr. Ethel
Osborne entertained a selection of the auoi-
ence at supper at their home, and there was
coffee and cake for the others at the Club
house. The Edward Stevens couple, Mrs.
Ralph Simmons, a sister of Dr. Ethel
Osborne, Professor and Mrs. Gunn, the
Paynes, James Barrett and his lady, the
Masson lady, Mrs. Ernest Scott and many
others with Uni. affiliations were there.
The Old Fintonians Dram. Soc. made a
good job of its production of “The Saving
Grace” at the Playhouse on Thursday night.
The fashions of 1014 were faithfully resur-
rected. Celia Minchin wore soft-cream
frills and taffeta that more than covered the
knees. Mary Sutherland wore with distinc-
tion an ankle-length frock of pale-grey satin
with a dash of emerald green. “ ’Op-o’-Me-
Thumb,” which served as a curtain-lifter,
gave Janet Walker, Valda Richardson, Ruth
Drake, Olive Norman and Helen Minchin
a chance to appear in the attire appropriate
to a laundry. Melbourne Hospital benefited.
Sales of lucky-bags, supervised by Dr. Conrad
Hiller’s wife and Mrs. J{. It. Stawell, helped
the good cause.
The Percy Shier couple, of East St. Kilda,
mobilised a lot, of musical folk on Friday
night to meet Mrs. Max Pirani (profession-
ally Leila Doubleday), an Australian-born
violinist who will be associated with tenor
Hislop during his tour in these parts. The
hostess, who made a name as a pianist when
she was Rita Hope, was in hyacinth-blue
with a tracery of beads of the same shade.
Mrs. Pirani wore black tulle with a sparkle
of crystal embroidery. Gladys MacDowell
and Gwen Selva, singers, Gertrude Ilealy,
violinist, and some other talented folk made
music. The guest of honor and her hostess
played a Brahms duet.
The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s
Beethoven concert at the Auditorium brought
Fritz Hart a well-earned laurel wreath.
Pianist Louise Gargurevich, in a white gown
with crystal fringe, played the Concerto in
G; Bertha Jorgensen, violinist, in a black
robe trailed with red roses, was heard in
the Romance in F; and soprano Muriel
Cheek, wearing a sparkle of petunia-pink
sequins on black, sang “Ah Perfido!” Atten-
dants were kept busy passing up posies, and
the front rows enjoyed a continuous perfume
of daffodils, carnations and boronia.
Sister Helen Dow, laid to rest in
Brighton Cemetery the other day, was the
p h ilanthropic
daughter o f
the late J. L.
Dow, once
Vic. Minister
for Lan d s.
For years she
was one of
the soul- and
body - saving-
band of women
attached t o
th e Central
Methodist Mis-
sion, Lonsdale-
street, Mel-
bourne, and
did good work
for the Set-
tlers’ League
an d various
o r g anisations
c o n c e rned.
with women's
welfare. The
group of former fellow-workers who
mustered at the graveside for the last tri-
bute looked very grief-stricken. Broothorn
made the picture.
The decorations from an artists’ frivol of
the night before, gave an air of levity to the
Albert-street Con. on Thursday morning
when Dame Nellie arrived to hear some
young singers, and the diva took her cue
from the scenery. After placing a chaste
salute upon Fritz Hart’s forehead —a tri-
bute to his worth as a conductor of Beet-
hoven a couple of nights before—she went
to the piano and played a few bars of jazz.
After that, however, the serious work of
the morning went on, and the students got
a lot of helpful advice.
St. Kilda’s mayor, Burnett Gray, was
given a grandfather's clock and his wife
acquired a diamond-set wristlet watch, gifts
of the aldermen and councillors of the dis-
trict. Festoons of mauve and pink flowery
floated over 900 dancers. Mrs. Gray gleamed
in oxidised gold lame.
Solicitor-General Garrau’s lady added a
Harold Herbert etching to her collection when
she had a farewell cup of tea one afternoon
last week with Mrs. Norman D. Trenery, of
Toorak. There was an assemblage of folk
interested in the Eye and Ear Hospital—the
guest was president of the auxiliary and Mrs.
Trenery is the fountain-pen driver for the
Southern Suburbs branch. G. A. Syme’s lady
said “Good-bye and good luck” for the hospi-
tal workers, and Mrs. F. J. Clendinnen, Mrs,
Clarence Marriott and George Cuscadeu's
lady were amongst those who showed they
approved of the sentiment.
Pianist Friedman was lionised by ladies
at an Austral Salon tea-drinking the other
afternoon. Nancy Weir, a girleen of 11,
played Chopin and a little piece of her own
invention, and Marie Bremner, J. Alexander
Browne and Leslie Jephcott sang. Hamilton
Bateman played his violin. The Salon presi-
dent, Mrs. Thomas Baker, Mrs. W. B.
Adamson and her daughter Hester, Mrs.
W. B. Earle, Mrs. Langham Noakes and her
sister Sheila Buchan and Vera Bedford
joined in the welcome.
Pianist Friedman’s greeting at the hands
of the Uni. Con. was a bright and informal
affair. Prof. Bernard Ileinze, Chancellor
MacFarland, medical knight James Barrett
and Herbert Brookes spoke words of welcome
and enumerated the guests’ achievements.
Ariel Seeligson played some Debussy pieces,
and Victor Stephensen a Chopin number, after
which the afternoon-brew was handed round
by students. Mayoress Morell and her
daughter Sheila, the Weston Pelt couple,
Mrs. Victor Wischer and the Barrett lady
were there.
This is a Ruskin picture of Beatrice Beard,
Associate and Licentiate of the London. Col-
lege of Music. Not yet 17 and still a Presby-
terian college student, her specialty is elocu-
tion. She is
a younger
daughter of
the late Henry
Bea r d, who
once upon a
time was Bate-
man's spokes-
man in Vic.
Leg. Assem-
bly, and her
mot h e r has
made a name
as a writer.
After several
sue cesses on
the concert
platform Miss
Beard will
test her talents
as a dramatic
speaker in a
performance of
“T h e Setting
of the S u n,”
which is to be broadcast next week from
3LO.
Tenor John Brownlee, of Geelong, is
credited with having scored a big success in
“Lohengrin” at the Paris Opera House
lately. He returns here next April, but for
a short, visit only, as he has a further IS
months' contract to fulfil abroad. His
sister Dulcie, who has a fine mezzo-soprano
voice, was one of those selected to sing before
Melba and Alma Gluck at the Albert-street
Con. on Friday, and made a very good im-
pression.
This week 12 South Australian girls
arrived to help stimulate interest in folk
dancing. They are pupils of Miss Gloyn,
the English expert. The Sutton Crow couple
of the Uni. Con. held a folk-dancing party
at Melba Hall lately with much success, and
this week aii exhibition was arranged at
Melba Hall with the visitors from S.A.
demonstrating. Marjorie Hatchard sang
some English folk-songs.
The Alliance Franeaisc gathering on Thurs-
day night was an affair of music, drama and
jazz. Two short plays were brightly pre-
sented, and there were operatic interludes
by Madame Edouard Lambert. The French
Consul-General, M. Rene Turck, and his
wife, Miss Monash, Yvonne Herry, Liliane
Gay, the G. A. Watsons and Dr. Lodewyckx
were contributors to the entente.
James Barrett’s lady held a little show" of
her water-colors at her home the other day.
She was a gallery student of promise, and
her work commands respect. Two of the
still-life studies were ear-marked for presen-
tation, a group of water-lilies for the Castle-
maine Art Gallery, and another flower piece
for the McPherson School of Domestic
Economy. The artist received her guests in
black chiffon velvet.
On Thursday evening the Kaola Film Co.

ments.

don. Thelma Asche. daughter of Mrs. John
Asche and a niece of the Oscar Asche,

in the field of historical research. Some
wonderful old lace and silver brocade, lent
by Lily Brayton, clothed the titian-haired
bride.
Florence Young, another .Melbourne Uni.
graduate, was also married in London
recently, her chosen being Rex Blumer,
director of a college on the African Gold
Coast. She had been asked to attend Thelma
Asche as a bridesmaid, but her own marriage
came a week ahead, and a substitute had to
be empanelled.
Jean Leslie, the Melbourne girl who lately
had a wedding in London and became Mrs.

a while. Her husband has given up his army

always came back the worse in health.

Mrs. Amery. wife of the Dominions Sec-
retary. is being freely criticised for making
it easier than it used to he for overseas
visitors to be presented at Buckingham Pal-
ace. The most acid remarks come from
Australians settled over there, who have
developed a fine sense of class distinction.
But the war changed many things, and Lon-
don now looks at these matters as demo-
cratically as Melbourne does.
Mrs. 11. McL. Duigan likes South Africa

the part and is able to do justice to the

daffodils, borouia, and some almost red violets
from the Alister Clark garden.
Melbourne is over-run this week with den-
tists from all parts of the continent who

Queensland Forests Limited.
Great Afforestation Enterprise
ENDORSED BY QUEENSLAND INVESTORS
AS FINANCIALLY SOUND.
The investing public has accorded remarkable support to the
afforestation scheme of Queensland Forests, Ltd. It is BARELY
THREE MONTHS since the Company was registered, yet during that
brief period share capital subscribed has increased as follows:
May 31, 1927 £3,800
June 30, 1927 £25,925
July 31, 1927 £31,225
August 15, 1927 £33,375
This SUBSCRIBED capital is three times greater than the NOMINAL
capital on which the largest New Zealand Company commenced
operations.
Additional applications for Shares are being received daily.
BOND CAPITAL SUBSCRIBED.
The sale of bonds was commenced during June, and although the
Company’s sales organisation is not yet complete, the following sales
figures indicate the remarkable progress that has been achieved:—
To June 30 - - £4,155
To July 15 £8,740
To July 31 £22,205
To August 15 £34,000
PRACTICAL WORK.
The Company has advertised for a Director of Forests, at a
commencing salary of £l5OO per annum, in the leading Forestry
Journals of Australia, Europe and America.
Mr. W. R. Petrie, Experimental and Investigation Officer in the
State Forestry Service, has joined the Company’s staff, and will have
charge of all practical operations. That Mr. Petrie has an intimate
knowledge of silvicultural problems is proved by his long association
with the Forestry Department, and the success attending his experimental
work has won for him glowing tributes from many authorities on
forestry, including Lord Novar, Professor Wilson (Director of the
Arnold Arboritum. U.S.A.), Commissioner Jones, Messrs. J. H. Maiden,
R. T. Baker, J. F. Bailey, E. H. F. Swain, E. Armitage and others.
Skilled foresters are already at work preparing the nurseries.
UNIQUE ADVANTAGES.
Owing to the fact that valuable timbers are already growing luxuri-
antly on the Company's properties, returns will be available more quickly
than in any other afforestation scheme. These timbers are NOT
CONFINED TO ONE SERIES, but include a large and valuable variety
of softwoods.
As the Company makes provision for marketing the timber by
erecting sawmills, bondholders will receive LARGER PROPORTION-

A hollyhock garden on the stage was a
feature ot the Moreton Club’s ball in South
Brisbane City Hall. With Persian rugs and
palms a portion of the hall was made into
a lounge for vice-regal and other visitors.
There were basket tables decked in pink
roses, and a lattice of hollyhocks and roses
transformed the entrance. A marquee was
set along the outside of the hall, draped
with flags, for sitting out, and black bowls
of pink sweet-peas were on the principal
supper table, where the Stonehavens, Good-
Avins, and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were
seated. Jan McDowell, in ivory mariette and
silver, with a cloak of pale pink and ostrich
feathers, and Dorothy Webster, in ivory
taffetas with a draped Quaker fichu of
taffetas, were debs. Lady Stonehaven was
m mignonette-green with a diamond tiara,
emeralds and ropes of pearls. Priminister
Bruce’s wife wore amethyst.
The old-timers say this is the coldest
August Brisbane has ever known, for we
are sti*l having frosts in low-lying parts
of the Suburbs.
A faithless mother pussy deposited a tiny
kitten with the C.I. branch in George-street
some years ago, and Tom has remained the
detectives’ pet ever since. He was sleeping
in his. lined basket in the office when the
explosion of Saturday night sent him flying
from the wrecked building. The officials
thought he had gone up with the roof, but
lie has reappeared in the vicinity, and refuses
flatly to go back to the building, crying dis-
tressfully when lie looks at the ruins.
Henry Fineh-Hatton, Earl of Winehilsea
and Nottingham, who died lately in London,
gave his name to flic township of Fineh-
Hatton near Mackay. He and a brother
were, graziers there. lie married one of
Admiral Codrington’s daughters.
For the third day of the Eagle Farm
races there was a big roll up. and the gay
parasols matched primula, stocks and sweet-
peas in the flower-beds. Bowls of roses
and mauve stocks decorated the tables where
the Q.T.C. committee entertained the Stone-
havens and Goodwins. Lady Stonehaven
wore cream silk lace over maize, and a
black criu. picture hat. Lady Goodwin
was in French grey, with panels of Madras
silk, and rose straw capeline.

jazzing. The Children’s Hospital got a
cheque in consequence.

TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The O’Gradys have had a busy time lately.
They were both present at the A.F.A. ball
at Anglesea Barracks, opened a fair and at-
tended a dance at Sorell next day, and were
at the Wattle Ball got up by the Old Hobart
ians. His Ex. unveiled the new organ at
Wesley Church, and attended the dinner to
General Jess at Hadley’s. Margaret O’Grady
went to Campbelltown for the point-to-
point steeplechase, and presented the trophies.
The steeplechase week at Campbelltown
attracted swarms of motorists from north
and south. His Ex.’s Margaret w r as the
guest of the Jim Melroses at Barton, and
among others who went up from Hobart were
Mrs. r J Com Lyons. Jean Mandeyille, Nancy
Giblin. Lilian Walsh (Brisbane! and Bren-
don Clarke. The most interesting event was
the ladies’ race, in which the horses were
ridden by their fair owners. The T. W. H.
Clarkes gave a dance at Quorn Hall, and
the Eustace Camerons (Mona Vale) followed
suit with a ball in the Ross Town Hall.
Model yachts, photos of champion yachts,
and a large nautical bell decked the Conti-
nental for the Royal Yacht Club Ball. About
200 guests jazzed, the dancers including
Nicholls, C.J., and his lady, Commander Mc-
Farlane and liis wife, Vice-Commander Bed-
dome and his life-partner, the J. L. Rycrofts,
the J. Boyds and the officers from the Huon.
Beads figured prominently in the frocking.
The Nicholls lady, who opened a new
Child Welfare Centre (the fourth), was
able to boast that last year’s statistics had
shown the lowest loss of infant life on record
in this island. The rate, however, is still
reckoned to be higher than it should be, and
the Child Welfare League needs all the help
it can get.
At the Wattle Ball in the Palais there were
500 dancers, and the ballroom was decorated
in all shades of yellow. A clever fancy
dance was given during the evening by
Thora Hicks. The Consumptive Sanatorium
got the profits.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Next month sees the beginning of the
end ot the present regime at: Government
House. Lady Bridges sails in the Nnldera
with her daughter and Mrs. Gerald Arm-
strong, and the Governor follows in Decem-
ber. The daughter, by the way, flew the
other day to Wallaroo and the Kadina races.
His Ex. was to have made the trip, but
at the last minute doctors vetoed it, so his
offspring took his place.

sen says there

ment in the
work at this
show compared
with that
offered at the
first one three years ago.
An “American tea,” planned by a com-
mittee beaded by Mrs. H. F. Shorney, was
given in the Royal Institution for the Blind
to raise funds for the annual picnic for its
workers, and there has been more money-
making at the Town Hall where a bridge
party, organised by Mrs. .1. H. Finlayson,
brought some much-needed cash for the
Babies’ Home at Walkerville. Lady Bridges
was there, and 100 tables were occupied.
The motor ball, at the Palais Royal, was on
the same evening—its proceeds for the Child-
ren’s Hospital.
Community singers have just had their
seventh birthday—-celebrating the event with
a special sing-song at the Town Hall and
a word or two from the Mayoress. The
society’s funds are limited to collections
taken at the lunch-hour singing, but from
them they have managed to spare nearly
£lOO for scholarships and help to young
singers. It owes its origin chiefly to Mrs.
Iv. H. Weston, a busy woman, who in her
scant spare time has also managed to write
one or two good novels—-the best-known of
them “The Man MacDonald.”
Helene Taylor, one of our promising
singers, who was sent to England to trans-
late promise into performance, is returning
for a bi'ief holiday, with honors thick upon
her. She will give a couple of concerts
here (one with the Glee Club, one of her
most consistent and generous backers) as
a prelude to a final polisli-np in London and
a debut there.
NO RTIIERN TERRITORY.
Darwin.
The St. Joseph’s Convent kids have given
us the best concert we ever had. A hundred
youngsters took part and charmed a crowded
Town Hall audience with their songs, reci-
tations and dances.
Judge Beeby’s wife and daughter, Captain
and Mrs. Butler (of Burns, Philp and Co.)
and Misses Robertson and Howell (over-
landers) were guests of the Victoria League
at the annual fancy-dress ball. The weather
was cool and delightful for dancing, and the
hall was beautifully decorated. Luxuries will
be provided for out-back hostels of the Aus-
tralian Inland Mission as a result of the jollo.
Just-dead Mrs. Henderson, formerly Mrs.
Kelsey, was a resident of Darwin in the early
’seventies, and after her second marriage re-
turned here again for awhile, her husband
being officer-in-charge of the Katherine tele-
graph-station. One of her sons, Percy Kelsey,
was for a long while manager of A. E.
Jolly’s store.
Dan Barnett has passed out. He arrived
in Darwin 40 years ago as driver for the com-
pany constructing the Darwin to Pine Creek
line, and stayed in the employment up to
within a few weeks of his death.
Other gaps in our ranks are caused by
the deaths of James Magorry (“Jimmy
Irish”) ; Paddy Byrne, for whom his mates
had lately taken round the hat. for they knew
that he was having a hard battle with illness .
and Colonel Serenekoff, formerly secretary
for the Elcho Island and Boucaut Bay Syn-
dicates. It was the Boucaut Bay Syndicate
that owned the Huddersfield, the boat that
was to break all records for speed on our
coasts, but which was out-raced by a black-
fellow’s dug-out, paddled by a couple of
gins and loaded up with piccaninnies, dogs
and tucker.
The September race meeting here will give
the locally-bred stock a lion’s sliaro of the
prize-money. The smaller station holders
and managers have been greatly bucked up.
Great improvements have been made in and
about the racecourse, and the sex that
shingles has not been forgotten.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted ; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Weve: Too obscure. Even if one is not
sure what a poem means, one ought to get the
impression that it means something. Aou ought,
in short, to make the reader suspect that it’s his
fault and not yours that he can’t see through it....
M.1.M.: Much obliged. But the Service correspon-
dence is already about a foot high every morning.
.... Potstick: Good idea. But that sort of thing
won’t write itself. Give it more attention....
F.W.M.: Sewer stuff C.C.: The overheard conver-
sation in “Children” spoils it.... Nance \\.: Very
fair work; but isn’t there any more cheerful subject
around?.... Jim C.: The dog’s tail is too 10ng....
F.M.: You’ve made one of your very rare misses.
. ...E.A.A.: Too long; it should be acceptable with
1200 words boiled out of it J.S.D.: What makes
you think them funny ?... .N.0.T.: Feeble jesting.
M.S. (S. Melb.) : Grisly humor G.8.W.: Your
dog wags a very scraggy tale. .. .Langani: No story
in it R.D.L.: The Scotchman in your melodrama
lives in Australia and talks sometimes like a Yankee,
at other times like an English yokel. It’s very
confusing J.L.M.: Your “Bones” are marrowless.
. ...C.0.G.: We decline to bend the knee. Nov, if
you’d asked us to bend the e1b0w!.... Mill N.: No,
we don’t blame you; but a kiss is not of general
public interest simply because it’s your first....
E.P.D.: Nebulous ' idea... .8.L.M.: The source of
your inspiration is evident; but this beats anything
he ever wrote : *
Poor, poor, sad girlie,
Wearied by sin ;
Face white, teeth pearly—
Done herself in !
. ...R.R.S.: “Murder —further.” Woodyer !.. ..
Laurie W.: Another shudder for “idolatrous —-shelter
u 5”.... Cam. D.: Why “psychologically disillusioned
matrimonial alliance” for “unhappy marriage” ? You
can be clever and simple t 00.... J.R.L.: So you
think that a “daring story”? Try it on the Sunday
at Home .... Mary S.: Doesn’t appeal; too much of
it, in any case... .R.J.R.: No need to christen
your nameless offerings... .Z.T. (Wangalie) : The
analysis of emotion can be done more incisively....
Viator: Get a better ending for “Togs.” Others
weak... .R.M.R.: Use of dope disqualifies your “Tin
Hare”.... Reg S.: Rough... .John W. B. F.: The
world is full of kisses; we only want those of
interest.... Billy D.: The idea is good; recast it.
A lot of the introduction doesn’t matter....E. Pat:
Too slight... .Scribbler: The blind man may see
print....J. Mac (Innisfail) : Too obviously made....
T.M. (East Melb.): Afraid you don’t know the
difference between pathos and bathos... .Finn: Weak.
. ...L.L.8.: So the parson stayed to tea? Came to
pray and remained to scoff Glory Y.: You’re do-
ing the Prince no kindness in asking people to “bend
before his greatness”... .J.R.M.: Your satire is mere
idiocy... .W.J.: Too much like an enigma. .. .Bugler:
What do you imagine you are? The trump of
doom upon a penny whistle?... .P.J.R.: There’s only
one occasion when we’d allow' the word to be spelt
that way; in a reference to the “scenter” of the
face.... C.A.L.: Rhyming pagan with multitude
may be a Great Truth, but it is not poetry....
8.L.A.: “True to Life” is a stiff unreality....
G.N.P.: If we wanted stories like, that, we could
take a S. M. Herald leader, giving it a romantic
introduction and a happy ending. .. .Pat: We hate
verse that carries footnotes to explain its rhyme....
J.E.T.: Rather long and singsongy. Just possible.
....Emer: There’s no great joke in that Lorio:
Jigs back to you... .8.J.0.: After an even tussle,
“Victory” went to the w.p.b .Koibo: The joke
arrives with the speed of a funeral... .R.K.: Appa-
rently Shakspeare’s muse shone “afar” because a
rhyme was needed for “star”... .M.K.: “Young
Love” nearly won us... .F.A.L.: You can judge
from what is published how we like it.... Bis L.:
“Cupid” ’arrowed our soul. . . .F.H.: Rhymed descrip-
tion of the politician as long-winded as the poli-
tician himself... .Abo: The “view to publication”
is a fax - , far view.... Gwladys C.: Crude work spoils
a good idea... .D.1.V.: The most skilled poet would
fail to make anything of that dull chronicle....
Roger II.: The fraud is too obvious... .Alido: The
fine invective of your spirit of prophecy becomes
I incoherent here and there. .. .S.F.F.: That method of
telling doesn’t improve a slight plot. .. .C.8.T.:
; Evidently you’ve been a naughty youth; but the
j mere statement of your naughtiness in verse is un-
| interesting Carot: After your hei - o stamped his
j feet we stamped the MS L.E.8.: Verse goes
j back; pars can’t be returned... ..Joan 11. : Not
i straightforward enough T.E.C.: We’d like to give
| Tassie a lift, but; that verse’s patriotic catalogue
wouldn’t ... .R.V.R.: Afraid you’re no good at it —
! even when you spell it “poatry”. .. . W.Y.N.: Un-
j moved when your hero died, being satisfied he never
! lived. . . .Bellerive: We welcome your insect:—
Old crusty fireplaces are
The cockroaches’ Retreat,
Where they thickly abound
’Midst smoke and Heat.
Fi - om the chimney soot,
j By the fire’s ruddy glow,
On cold winter nights
They dodge to and fro.
’Tis common for cooks
In anger to scoop
A lifeless specie from
A pot of soup.
In crevices they nestle.
Where flames approach.
A curious insect-
Is the chimney cockroach.

| worked episode G.V.8.: Poor.. . .F.G.H.: “Dream

; it' was topical Harry H.: You keep them right
I down on the level of dingy depression... .W.M.R.:

THE INKY WAY.
“Sol. M.” : August 13 to 15 was a busy
time in literary circles. On tlie Saturday
quite a number of papers reported the dis-
covery of Jericho, “2-J miles north-east of
Jaffa,” so somebody must have carried the
old place across country. And Monday’s S. M.
Herald ascribed the famous chapter concern-
ing snakes in Herrebow’s “Natural History
of Iceland” to Josh Billings!
“Uramao”: Many happy returns to the
Taranaki Herald (M.L.), which has just
been celebrating its 75th birthday without
having missed an issue in that period. It is
the third oldest paper in the Dominion, the
Lyttleton Times and Otago Witness
being first and second. The Herald was
established by Garland Woon, who edited the
paper till he sold it in 1867 to Henry
Weston; since then only two editors have
held the floor—the late W. 11. J. Seffern
and the present editor, W. J. Penn.
“S.T.S.”: A new terror is added to the
reporter’s life by an English decision in a
libel case. A wealthy American died (as
lie had latterly lived) in his yacht in an
Essex shipyard. A reporter was sent from
London to write up the incident, and —no
work going on at the time —spread himself
on the “desolate and deserted scene....
strange silence. .. .derelict shipyard.” The
owners say that it is not derelict, and have
been awarded £5OO for the damage done
to their business by the eloquent insult.
“Rob P.”: The saxophonist of our dance
orchestra hails from “N’Yark” and is getting
used to being barracked anent the tripey
nature of Hollywood’s film output. Between
dances the other night I produced a recent
Bulletin (11/8/’27), and offered the “The
Pied Piper from Hollywood” cartoon for his
digestion. “Pah!” he snorted scornfully. We
thought it was the satire on the films that
had raised his gorge, but he soon undeceived
us. “Films be damned! The guy’s holding
the saxophone wrong.” As a musician I
should say his indictment is unassailable.
“J.F.P.”: Told of John Norton that one
morning in 1910 when he had left his
umbrella behind and the nearest pub seemed
further off than usual, he sent out a reporter
to see if there was any chance of the weather
breaking. The scribe met a telegraph boy
on the steps, and mechanically opened the
flimsy. As lie passed Norton’s door, the
chief called out, “b.ill raining?” “No, dead!
replied the journalist, and handed Norton the
cable. It read, “King dead.” John loved
a timely retort, and the humorist found some-
thing extra in his pay envelope that week.
“C.Q.” : To show its zeal for Australasian
literature, the Argus is holding a plebis-
cite to find the most popular author and poet.
Among writers figuring high in some lists
are Price Warung, R. G. Jennings, Erie Cox,
Vernon Williams, Conrad Sayce, Constance
Le Plastrier, J. J. Malone, E. J. Boylan
and Marion Miller Knowles. There are many
genuine students of local letters who would
be hard put to name a solitary work by
some of these writers. As the voting pro-
ceeds the field begins to take this shape:
Poetry—Kendall, Gordon, Lawson, Pater-
son, Dennis and O’Dowd. Prose —Marcus
Clarke, Mrs. Gunn, Rolf Boldrewood, Law-
son, Bridges, Ethel Turner, Mary Graut
Bruce and J. M. Walsh. The complete list
reads as much as anything like a page from
the ledger of the Bulletin.
“C.Q.”: Easily the most human section
of Melbourne Argus is that euphemistically
scheduled “Missing Friends.” It usually
starts with the announcements of the private-
detective agencies which are ready to provide
the materials for the staging in any divorce-
court of that ancient drama, “The Infernal

what she shall write,” and “Peg o’ My

she has collected £BOO on a double. There
we have the lyric side of life. Finally some-
body advises that his tablets work wonders

“P.X.”: T. E. Rofe's case against
Smith's Weekly will cost the paper some-
thing like £12,500. The Privy Council the
other day said that when it decided that the
paper must pay “all costs below” it meant
all costs —of the hearing before a Judge and
of the appeal to the. Full Court as well.
That far the paper had won ; and it might
have had better luck with the Privy Council
if its junior counsel (Evatt) had been better
supported. The Privy Council is liable to be
touchy if it is confronted by any but the most
eminent- counsel. Holman, Rofe’s junior, had
the great Simon. What an impressive front
means was suggested the other day when one
English publisher was smitten for describ-
ing a shipbuilding yard as “desolate while

printed exactly the same thing, pleaded for
the public good,” and escaped.
“Avon”: The first thing that is drilled
into every proof-reader and reporter in

that the perfectlv-true statement that Jim
Snooksbury, who is selling shares in a gold-
mine located in Timaru, was gaoled in 1899
for stealing milk from an orphanage for
the blind, was prompted by malice. But
speeches in Parliament are privileged, and

and private life of a number of Samoan citi-

that he had been (1) convicted and im-
prisoned for embezzling church funds, (2)
suspected of pocketing thousands by fraudu-
lent company-promoting and (3) degraded

Alda, who ends her Sydney season to-day,
has not had the audiences she deserves.
Somebody must have spread the damning
news that she is Australian-born. Hers is a
voice of fluid sweetness and richness, top-
dressed by art. Perhaps her arias from
"Tosca” and “Butterfly” will live in the
popular memory longest because of these
works being so well known, but equally great
was her interpretation of the Manon Lescaut
numbers, and her singing of Handel was
marked by a convincing simplicity. Alda,
though, is no singer of ballads, their mean-
ing eludes her; but then the lark is not
expected to pipe the blackbird.
“Ruddigore” opens on . .Uurday night at
Sydney Her Majesty’s, "Madame Pompa-
dour” having bowed her adieu last night
I Wednesday) to make way for the G. and S.
company. There will be another newcomer
at thi> Grand Opera House, where Nellie
Bramley will introduce “Second-Hand
Brides.” “The Student Prince” is giving
the Empire management nightly evidence
that its choice commands popular apprecia-
tion. At the Royal Maurice Moscovitch and
co. maintain the atmosphere of mystery
with “The Ringer” ; and Margaret Lawrence
bails up Ham..bal at the point of smart dia-
logue on “The Road to Rome” at the Cri-
terion. After the conclusion of the Repertory
Theatre ’s “Mary Stuart” to-morrow night the
Palace will be occupied for a brief space
by the “Ypres” film; but in three weeks
this show-house will become the port of
"Outward Bound,” which brings Zillah Bate-
man back to Sydney. “Lady, Be Good” con-
tinues to comply with the advice at the St.

The Scotch tenor Joseph Hislop will have
Australian violinist Leila Doubleday and
accompanist and pianist Alberto Sciarreti to
help him when he opens his season at the
Sydney Town Hall on September B—Saturday8—Satur-
day week. The international combination
provides something extra in the way of star
concert fixtures.
s’.:
At the Town Hall on Wednesday of last
week the Sydney Philharmonic presented
Beethoven’s Mass in I) (“Missa Solennis”) as
its contribution to the centenary celebrations
in honor of the famous composer. It seemed
to have handicapped itself somewhat by awe-
at the immensity of its task, and there is no
doubt that Beethoven's scornful disregard of
the limitations of the human voice is specially
marked in this masterpiece. Yet there were
some conspicuous successes, the first of them
scored by tenor William Green in an admir-
able singing of the “Kyrio,” which spurred
him on to further triumphs. The soprano.
Madame Goossens-Viceroy, was dramatic but
not always clear in her enunciation. Victor
Evans and Ethel Daw were really good in
flic “Et Incarnatus.” The choir acquitted
itself with distinction here and there, notably
in the “Christi Eleison” and the brief
“Hosanna” ; but it faltered over the musical
fences in parts of “Gloria in Excelsis Deo,”
and panic almost overtook it in the “Credo.”
True, the basses stood their ground heroic-
ally, but the tenors fell into confusion. All
things considered, including the fact that
Beethoven was more concerned with what he
wanted than with what a band of choristers
can be expected to do. the performance was
a meritorious one, with magnificent moments ;
the orchestra, led by Cyril Monk, showed
itself capable, whilst Conductor Bradley hail
evidently taken great pains to secure har-
monious readings of passages in which tin;
Master has permitted himself all sorts of
musical licenses.

Fred Curran, who includes amongst his
musical items a cleverly arranged song
steeplechase much superior to the stuff
usually ladled out by vaudeville comedians, is
helping Edith Clifford and the Colored
Emperors of Song to keep Sydney Tivoli
audiences amused. Also the remarkable six
Gallenos are back whirlwinding through a
series of acrobatic and somersaulting feats,
the Ghezzy Bros, show themselves a hilarious
pair of tumblers and Leonora Di Yere has a
colorful act of a novel character. On Saturday
George Carney will return for a season.

This week Mo is dispensing broad-comedy
justice at Fullers’ Sydney theatre, in the
course of which he addresses Stiffy as Mr.
Abigail, and Claude Holland — has
changed over from “Lady, Be Good” —as
“Mr. Meagher.” A jester’s bladder, with
which Judge Mo pounds the head of the clerk
of the court whilst he adjudicates on all
charges from alcoholic disorderliness to
murder, supplies a good part of the humor;
but the audiences make no complaint.
“Moana,” at the Arcadia Theatre, Pitt-
street, Sydney, calls for a word, if only because
it tends to make Australians better acquainted
with some of their near-surroundings. There
is hardly anything that can be called a story
in it ; but on the thread of human interest
provided by the domestic affairs of a family
of natives, Robert Flaherty, F.R.G.S., has
strung an interesting picture of life in
Samoa, and the photography is excellent.
Some views of life from a queer angle, built
on the theme of a wfild, passionate girl who
declines to allow her musician lover to pass
to the keeping of another, are presented in
“New York” at the Lyceum, where “Stolen
Pleasures” is the supporting feature; and
some spectacular fighting of forest fires,
along with other thrills, is seen in “The Un-
derstanding Heart,” which introduces Francis
X Bushman, Junior, to the Australian public
as a leading man, said picture, bracketed
with “The Land Beyond the Law.” being or
view at Hoyt’s. “The Term of His Natural
Life” is having an appropriately long run
at the Crystal Palace, where, however, with-
out fixing a date, the next feature is being
mentioned; and “The Wonders of the Uni-
verse” is attracting crowds to the Adyar
Hall. The “Aviation in Australia” film is to
be produced at. the King’s Hall on Saturday.
English etchers;—
An unusually strong- show of etchings is that
presented at the Macquarie Gallery, Bligh-street,
Sydney, by four English artists. The distinctive
treatment by each adds variety to the interest of
the exhibition. E. Blampied, R.E., was a laborer
in the Channel Isles before his artistic talent gained
appreciation; there is vigor and frequently humor in
his work, as shown in “Male Choir,” and he despises
all non-essentials. “San Sebastian, Lunch Hour,” in
which four idling workmen are having a discussion,
is a study in cheerful liveliness. The drypoints of
W. Walcott, R.E., the essence of which is graceful-
ness, delicacy of line and imaginative power, stand
out in strong contrast. Along with his delightful
small studies he has some larger pictures in which
subtle strokes and a mastery of shadows combine to
pYoduce magnificent effects, as in “St. Peter’s, Rome.”
These are the most interesting of the contributors;
and that is not detracting from the good work of
lan Strang, set out with amazing detail, or the
strong portraiture of Joseph Simpson, whose “A
Child” is charming.
“CRADLE SNATCHERS " AT
MELBOURNE KING'S.
Maury Tackerman being snatched by
Bertha Belmore.
The ukulele, the taro-patch fiddle and other
Hawaiian noises are threatening at the
Athemeum, Melbourne, so the haven of
“Outward Bound” will be closed to all-
comers after to-morrow night. The Royal
is standing on “Tiptoes,” and large audiences
appear to like the show. “The Sheik,” at the
Palace, is exhausting all the popular devices
to advertise its voluptuous charms. One is
to represent Mrs. E. M. Hull’s book as a
forbidden work that girls carry round in
brown-paper covers. “Cradle Snatchers."
at the King’s, needed no more advertisement
after the amusing frenzy of the daily-paper
critics. It’s only really serious competitors
are Olsen and Johnson at the Tivoli. Some
of their sketches are a good deal more
frowsy than funny,, but the same papers that
made a how] at “Cradle Snatchers” surveyed
O. and J. with approbation. “Mrs. Warren's
Profession,” at Queen’s Hall, even got a pat
on the back for being obscene. Apparently
to be dull and dirty is more meritorious
than to be humorously improper.
Melb. Auditorium was given one night off
from Ignaz Friedman by Fritz Hart and his
symphony orchestra last week, and a small
congregation thankfully received the Beet-
hoven provided, beginning with the Corio-
lanus overture. The story of the unusual poli-
tician whose proud spirit sought death rather
than truckle to the mob —in real life he
wouldn’t even seek a dissolution —was told in
“TIP TOES” AT MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Thurza Rogers as “Tip Toes" Kaye; Cecil
Kelleway as Hen Kaye, a vaudeville
artist, breaking into Palm Beach
society.
a brave way by the strings, but there was
a general woolliness about the phrasing
where it should have been most dramatic.
Bertha Jorgensen’s violin rose to the de-
mands of the Romance in F and Louise Gar-
gurevich stroked the orchestra at the piano
through the Concerto in G, bringing out its
lyrical quality in a fashion that raises won-
derings why the lady is not brought forward
oftener. The rather theatrical “Ah Perfido”
scena was sung with Italian intensity by
Muriel Cheek’s soprano. The big event was
the Fourth Symphony. This lovely piece is
seldom given tongue to, in Australia or
abroad, except on the gramophone. Perhaps
the frankness of its utterance is too much
for modern nerves. Every imaginable caress
of passion is stated with a directness that
would bring a posse of gendarmes hurrying
to the scene if it were put into words instead
of into chords of breath-taking beauty.
Fritz’s conspirators made the slow movement
something to be carried home and stored in
the memory. It would be hard to imagine
a better rendering. Ir the spirited conductor
wore his hair long and passed himself off as
some sort of Pole his fine show would pro-
bably have been more crowded.
When a young man from U.S.A. started
to dance continuously for 100 hours, the
Green Mill, a hall on the south side of the
Yarra, hitherto given over to the serious
business of jazz, suddenly leaped into promi-
nence as a place of amusement. During the
daylight the house was packed, but it gradu-
ally unpacked itself as the evenings wore
on, until by three in the morning it was
a vast, cold, desolate portmanteau, in a corner
of which the misguided youth still shuffled to
and fro in carpet slippers to the wailing of
a phonograph, with his ankles visibly swell-
ing. his eyeballs starting, his breath coming
and going in short pants, and his trembling
legs ever doing the same in long ones. When
the third day dawned his female partners
—six of them in three-hour shifts —were
dragging the hero to and fro. By the fourth
they were openly carrying him in slings,
and doctors were examining his heart at
intervals, attendants were dosing him with
brandy, and masseurs were kneading his body
while he feebly wagged one leg to show
his indomitable spirit. At the fiOth hour
an outburst of public indignation moved the
management to threaten to forcibly remove
him from the scene unless he ceased his
Marathon. The promoter then hurried out
to tell the 2000 people waiting at the gates
that the show was over, and hastened back
to count the profits.

To-night Muriel Cheek, Walter Kirby, and

dour” will be at home at His Majesty’s.

“One Hour of Love” is the allowance
at Melbourne Majestic this week; Jacqueline
Logan and large audiences are sharing it.
In the noisy picture department Pres.
Coolidge is heard congratulating Lindbergh
on his Atlantic hop. At Hoyt’s head-
quarters “The Understanding Heart” is
beating afternoon and evening.
Fair audiences continue to warm them-
selves at Friedman’s tire at Melbourne Audi-
torium. The poet of the piano in its most
barcarollean mood can provide the lava of
emotion when he likes, and there was
vehemence and even savagery in his render-
ing of Beethoven’s Apache-onata on Thurs-
day. Chopin under his fingers varies from
murmurs no louder than the tremblings of
a leaf to hailstorms that make the hearing
fumble for its umbrella. “Marquis and Mar-
quise,” a giddy little bit of eighteenth cen-
tury bric-a-brac, was written at the special
request of Friedman by himself to show
off that side of his talent in which he starts
a lap behind all his compatriots and finishes
10 lengths ahead. This afternoon he gives
a concert, banks the money and flees the
city.
Lilliputian art: —
On the walls of the New Gallery, the work of
Bernice Edwell looks as forlorn and lost as a prize
poodle in a 40-acre paddock. Her landscapes aren’t
much larger than her miniatures, but a microscope
isn’t needed to disclose her deficiencies in the out-
of-doors. Her art doesn’t often sing, and when it
does it sings a trifle flat; her planes are frequently
awry and the solidity of her skies oppresses. But
her postage-stamp portraits are as assured and
clever as her other work is hesitant and dull.
The Victorian artist R. W. Sturgess is holding
his second exhibition of water-colors in Adelaide at
Foy and Gibson’s Galleries, run in conjunction with
the Sedon Galleries, Melbourne. The subjects are
Australian bush for the most part; the artist’s light
and shade treatment makes the most commonplace
scene attractive. “Afternoon Light,” “Mid-day Fog,”
“Miner’s Hut (Sunrise)” and “F.vening Silhouette"
are some of the most desirable.
An Australian in Paris: —
The 1927 Paris Salon contained five exhibits (the
limit for an outsider) by Max Meldrum, whose
canvases were really notable. With the exception of
a still-life study, all the work was done in Australia,
Amongst the Australians at the official opening were
Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Tweddle, intimate friends of
the artist, whose only landscape on view was a
sketch painted at their Sunbury stud farm. A
couple of Meldrum’s paintings found a place in the
illustrated catalogue, but here Australia was robbed
of an advt. it should have had by Max being
scheduled as a Scot.
“Rose Marie” lias just at
Adelaide Royal. At the Prince of Wales.
Muriel Starr is doing good business with a
weekly change of programme. As Margaret
Case, in “The House of Glass,” she receives
admirable support from Harvey Adams as
the breezy lawyer, Hugh McLennan; both
staging and frocking are exceptionally good.
At the Majestic, the Stud Foley Follies arc
in their third week and continue to provide
plenty of variety in the matter of clever
sketches, song, dance and clean humor. Hal
Cooper has a fine tenor voice and the musical
numbers are catchy. At 'West’s Pictures.
“One Increasing Purpose” is a bit out of
the usual frotli-and-bubble of Filmland. A.
S. M. Hutchinson’s post-war novel is a care-
ful and convincing bit of work, and the Eng-
lish setting comes as a pleasant change.
“Lone-liand Saunders” features Fred Thomson
and his marvellous horse Silver King. To
add variety there is a boxing turn by Lind-
say Fabre and his trained kangaroo. Aussie.
“M.G.S.” : Exactly why has the imagina-
tion of the professional child-reformer seized
on (lie screen? Charles Barrett, of the
League of Child Helpers, told the Film Com-
mission in Melbomme that his association has
500 agents who regularly report on what
goes on inside the nicture seraglios, and that
what the child needs is educative films. He
cited as the proper sort of thing an exciting
drama showing the beating of the heart and
the blood passing through the valves; also
he had in preparation an absorbing serio-
eomedy depicting how hollars and shirts are
made. I am prepared to believe that our
amusements can be improved, one way and
another, but why pick exclusively on the
film? Why not compel Mr. Barrett's golf
club to listen to a daily lecture on economics
—-and maintain the lecturer at its own
expense?

And laughter from the stars hung low.

Slow measures through a matchless night

MAOBILAND. BETTIK RIDDELL.
“Caul Boy”: After “Outward Bound” the
company will dismiss and immediately fall
in again to deal with "The Last Warning,”
to be staged at the, Melb. Athenaeum shortly.
A hite and Edgley will be the owners of the
new organisation, and comedian Frank Brad-
ley will produce for them. To take the
leading role, Louise Lovely says she will
forsake the screen. But the film actress who
has really forsaken the screen has yet to be
found.
: W. 11. Whiddon. master of the
N.b.VV. tax-hounds, waved the baton over
the first production of “Ruddigore” in Aus-
tralia. The Petersham Choral Society pm
on the opera for four performances at the
local Town Ilall in August, 1908.
"Cine Mu” : The cables aren’t usually so
humorous. A recent message from London
stated that- in a plebiscite on film favorites
Adolpe Menjou was second in the total
.counting, but the male vote placed him first.
’Phis was believed to be owing to his finished
picture performances as a betrayer. Appa-
rently the men envied him his technique.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Sydney Playbox sees
better things ahead. Hitherto its “theatre”
has been a room in Rowe-street, little better
than a glorified packing-case. But Lloyd
Jones has promised to make available a hall
which will hold between three and four hun-
dred people and provide better stage-room.
“Loud”: Seymour Hicks and Bruce
Bairnsfather have been in court. 8.8.
agreed to pay S.H. 5 per cent, of the net
profits on the U.S. production of “Old
Bill,” guaranteeing that “a minimum of such
Per cent, profits shall amount to £800.”
'•'he piece did not hit the American taste,
and there were no profits at all. Counsel
for 8.8. argued that 5 per cent, of nothing
is also nothing; but the Court ruled that
Bairnsfather must add another £3OO to his
losses.
“Hamfat”: There was a meeting, others
being present, between a young mummer who
has advanced to prominence on the Firm’s
bills and an old actor who has remained
much where he was—or gone back. “Why,
this is my old friend Roarer!” said the
young man patronisingly, introducing him to
a friend. “We all have our small beginnings,
,v know; it was Roarer here who made an ’
actor of me.” “My boy,” Roarer replied,
I would nev-er say that I made an ac-tor
of you ! Just gave you a place in my com-
pany—just a place in my com-pany, which
was oth-er-wise—er—a good one.”
“Hamfat”: Dion Boucicault leaves Eng-
land in September. With him come Irene
Vanbrugh, his wife, and Prudence, daughter
of Violet Vanbrugh and Arthur Bourcliier.
Violet divorced Bourcliier. who married
Kyrle Bellew, daughter of the beauteous
Curly that Australia knew; incidentally,
Bourcliier and his wife are likely to be
seen in Australia themselves soon. Prudence,
now 25, made her first appearance when
only 11 in “Peter Pan”; her adult debut
was made in the same play, in 1922, as Mrs.
Darling.
“Jack Point”: Now that “Ruddigore”
has been successfully produced in Australia,
consideration might be given to the presenta-
tion of Gilbert’s own favorite, “Utopia Ltd.”
It is an excellent satire upon the Limited
Liability Act, with a parting prod in the
tail at party government. The piece is said
to have offended royalty. Certainly Para-
mount, King of Utopia, is forced by the
public exploder to write scandalous things
about himself in the Palace Keeper, but it
isn’t half as “offensive” as the things that
the Kings of Barataria are forced to do by
their flunkeys in the second act of “Tne
Gondoliers.” Australians would appreciate
“Utopia Ltd.” much more than the Lon-
doners did.
“ILK.”: Many years ago, during a circus
season at Adelaide Royal, a lion decided to
relinquish Lis stage career and walked out
of his cage. The placid old crock of the
jungle met F. 11. Pollock, the portly lessee,
in tlie corridor. Pollock shinned up the fire-
escape and sent out Morse code signals with
his famous diamonds. A peanut vendor from
the “gods” hurried down and led Leo by the
ear into the wings. From this point he called-
in a loud whisper to the lion-tamer, then
engaged in another act on the stage: “Hey,
mister, ’ore’s yer lion.”
“Hamfat” : Play fashions move in cycles.
Australia has seen "The Bat,” “The Ghost
Train” and “The Ringer,” and “Dracula”
is to come. The London run of “Dracula”
has been distinguished by nightly faints and
one death. It concerns the ghastly doings
of a man-vampire who prolongs his life for
centuries by sucking the blood of his vic-
tims. Strindberg's “The Spook Sonata,”
staged at London Strand at the end of June,
is another nightmare. In the second act a
group of sinister beings are collected around
a table, their figures reflected in a sloping
mirror overhead.
“Lud”: London playgoers arc to be pro-
vided with something out of the ordinary ;
a new musical piece is to be produced "at the
Duke of York’s by Dion Boucicuult with a
woman member of the House of Commons in
the cast. The lady, Mrs. Pliilipson, is no
stranger to the stage, for as Mabel Russell
she was a prime favorite when leading
comedienne at the Gaiety and other West
End houses. The play in which the M.P.
returns to her first love, “during the Par-
liamentary vacation,” is an adaptation of
the W. J. Locke novel, “The Beloved Vaga-
bond,” with lyrics by the veteran Adrian
Ross and music by Dudley Glass, Aus-
tralian composer and critic.
“Curtain Raiser”: The British Empire
Academy, recently launched in England to
“further the arts and ultimately unite the
NOT HALF WHAT IT WAS CRACKED UP TO BE.
“I suppose she thinks she’s in Heaven now she’s on the stage?”
“Gee, no. It’s torture—she has to stand by while the other women get all the attention.”
Empire” in the worthy cause, has started
a Vic. branch. Its local promoter is Peter
Gawthorne, who played the St. Peter in
“Outward Bound.” He claims that the
chief aim is to give promising artists an
opportunity to have their work heard or
seen by others, so that finally they might have
a chance to prove themselves in the hub of
the Empire. But Australian artists don’t
need any encouragement to rush to London.
They start packing up their toothbrush as
soon as they know by the applause that
Australian audiences have certified to their
merit. And they don’t return until their
powers are middle-aged and rheumy. What
is needed is not an organisation to help them
to get away, but something that will en-
courage them to stay.
“L. de II.”: James Alexander, the Ameri-
can who embarked on the foolish pastime
of trying to dance continuously for 100 hours
in Melbourne, made a pathetic complaint to
a reporter. He said that up to 4 a.m. on
each day of his trial the hall was fairly
crowded, but afterwards it emptied, and jazz-
ing—or shuffling—up and down in a dead
silence, broken only by the carol of the
butcher-boy going on his meaty rounds or
the scream of a late cat on the roof, induced
a feeling of despondency. Apparently -he
expected a continuous stream of gapers at
his fatuous marathon. The man who allowed
liimself to be “hypnotised” by a professional
mesmerist.in Wellington (M.L.) had a better
job. After being allegedly put to sleep lie
was tucked into a comfortable bed in a
shop window in Willis-street. Being on
nTghtwork in a building opposite, I used to
go across occasionally to help him through
his “trance.” He said lying still in bed
made a man hungrier than a day s hard
work in the open. The few passers-by who
saw him sitting up in bed munching the pie
I brought him did not affect the impressive-
ness of his daylight imitation of uncon-
sciousness.
“C.W.”: It is claimed for the waxworks
now touring N.S.W. that it is the only show
of the kind in Australia. The gruesome tab-
leaux range from the crimes of Frank Butler
to the murder of Walsh and Pitman at Kal-
goorlie. When the show was at Bathurst
an onlooker, tilled with virtuous indigna-
tion and beer, smashed to pieces the tab-
leau of Williams, the Paddington murderer,
in the act of killing his three children. The
advertisement the show received must have
hem worth more than the damage.
“Hamfat”: Sydney gets its first “atmo-
spheric” picture theatre in the Capitol, which
is going up on the site of the old Hippo-
drome. The ceiling of the auditorium is de-
signed to give spectators an impression that
they are sitting under a star-studded sky,
across which clouds are passing. The sug-
gestion that the piece of sky hangs over
Venice will be imparted by pictures, tap-
estries and statues and the design generally.
The show-house is to cost £120,000 and will
seat ,‘>2oo people.
“The Listening-Insect”: Broadcasting has
already done wonders in improving stage
elocution. Barnstormers, who thought they
were intelligible because of their lovely dic-
tion, whereas actually their audiences had
become expert lip-readers, have found that
unseen audiences demand a purer quality of
speech. The radioing of sermons is now
beginning to have a like effect on the pulpit-
thumpers ; and a good job, too, for the
monotonous wailing, punctuated with false
emphasis, which a type of church rhetorician
mistakes for eloquence, is enough to drive
any listener not tone-deaf to hang up the
receiver and go back to the Sunday Sun-
burst. The other evening, being interested
to know what happened to the husband of
the lady who was turned into a pillar of
sodium chloride, I set my teeth and listened
right through a sermon on “the God of Lot.”
It wasn’t till the last minute that I tumbled
to the fact that what the rev. gentleman was
talking about was the god of Luck.
“Caul Boy”: A great, song was made
about the feat of Billie Lockwood in mimick-
ing Judith Anderson when that lady had
to remove the Green Hat temporarily
through sickness. Nine actors out of ten
are merely mimics. If they had any indi-
viduality of their own they wouldn’t be
actors. Ducking in and out of four or five
theatres per week I hear nothing but echoes.
When one vaudeville clown imitates another
in a neighboring playhouse he is infringing
no copyright: the other fellow has prigged
his stuff from somebody else. If you can’t
locate the original be sure it exists, even
if it hasn’t yet reached this country. “The
Best People" company brought a new real-
istic technique to Australia. This technique
is now being faithfully copied by a dozen
mummers and mummesses. Theatregoers
should be grateful for this mimetic gift in
actors. Australian entrepreneurs seldom care
to spend the cash on bringing the great
originators of stage style until they have
reached the evening of their days. So the
low-paid mimics obligingly provide us with
bits of Jane Cowl, Ethel Barrymore and
Crock in translation.
"Cine Ma”: If the phonofilm becomes
universal—and American picture-houses are
installing the apparatus as quickly as they
can get delivery—it will have one effect
which has not been remarked on. Speech
will tend to become standardised, not only
over the English-speaking world, but over
long periods of time. The word written
standardised our wonderful spelling; tin*
word photographed will fix the way it is pro-
nounced. 1 always wondered how the Yankee
of Mark Twain’s book made himself under-
stood at King Arthur’s court; he will have
no difficulty if lie jumps a thousand years
into the future.
“C.Q.”: One of the hundreds of letters
alleged to have been received by the manage-
ment of “The Sheik’’ at Melbourne Princess:
“His wonderful eyes and thrilling love-
making are enough to make one wish that
Sheiks such as Bobert Ginns were to be met
with every day.” Middle Brighton is given
as the address of the writer. What is tin*
matter with the boys of Middle Brighton V
“Jara”: At Byron Bay (N.S.W.) the
School of Arts committee runs the picture-
show. The committeemen, who are elected
annually, select the programmes and do all
the work about the hall gratis; tin* profits
go toward buying better pictures. The night
I was there "Mademoiselle from Armen-
tieres” was on the bill, which was particu-
larly good. 1 mentioned this to a local
resident. “Just as well for the committee,”
he replied. “If they give us bad pictures we
shoot ’em out!”
“Felix” : Lotus Thompson, the Sydney girl
who appeared it) several Australian films,
has a good part with Clara Bow in "Rough
House Rosie,” a Hollywood production to
be shown in Australia shortly. Lotus was
supposed to have poured acid over her
legs so that she would not be chosen for
bathing-girl parts. But she has been picked
against all-comers for a beauty scene in
"Mr. Wu.”
"Teamster”: The playbill of one of the
native troupes of actors in the Malay Penin-
sula is headed, "In loving memory of our
beloved William Shakspeare the Selangor
Co. will stage the sensational tragedy of
Prince Hamlet.” No attempt is made at
literal translation; songs and music inter-
vene ; the ghost scene becomes a riotous
farce; and a comic policeman telephones
to the police station for reinforcements.
Ophelia’s madness sets the house rooking ,
and Hamlet’s soliloquies are jettisoned. It is
announced that “Our clowns are withoui
rival.” In “Othello” the survivors of tin*
tragedy group themselves and sing a song
to the melody of "Home, Sweet Home.”
“Adamaseus”: One dinkum Australian
actor has made good at Hollywood—the
kangaroo. In the last few weeks I have
seen four Yankee pictures in which a ’roo
figured, mostly as an exponent of boxing,
and in each case his appearance was hailed
with screams of delight. Rightly _ handled,
the ’roo will make a name for himself in
Australian films—that’s if the Yanks don't
over-supply the demand.
“Cine Ma” : Groping for seats at picture-
shows will soon be a thing of the past. At
the new Roxy theatre in N’York every one
of the 6000 seats is connected to an immense
indicator board. When a patron at a con-
tinuous show vacates his possie, he leaves a
lamp glowing in his place, and a correspond-
ing globe lights in the box-oflice. A ticket
can then be issued immediately to the next
comer, who finds his way by following a
series of electric beacons. The Roxy, inci-
dentally, is the last word in moving-picture
caravanserai. In its first month it gathered
in £lOO,OOO. Its owner. Samuel Rothafel, is
a stripling of 42 who started a few years ago
in a country village by hiring a bootmaker’s
shop and a second-hand projector.
“Hasen”: Stephanie Deste, of the “Rose
Marie” co., did an out-of-the-ordinary doub-
ling of parts the other night in Melbourne.
Straight from her role of Wanda in that
piece she was rushed by car to the 3LO
studio, where she became Juliet in the bal-
cony scene. Lacking the aid of television
with our receiving sets, we missed the sight
of a Romeo jn sober 1927 kit and a Juliet
in the dress (or undress) of a musical-
comedy Indian maid, which should have been
somewhat startling even in this age of a
Hamlet in plus-fours.
The “Hop” Memorial Number of The
Bulletin next week will reproduce "I
Thought I Had a Stamp,” the drawing
which first made the artist’s reputation in
Australia as a great humorist. A generous
selection of his other drawings will furnish
a fitting memento of Australia’s most genial
draughtsman.

REPAIR BILL
■ -
cC
£ 40.0.0
Read how Alemite Lubrication will prevent
. costly repairs to your car
80% of repair bills have oeen traced to one
cause which you can now eliminate and at the
same time reduce the operating cost of your
car anywhere from a half-penny to a penny
half-penny a mile.
This cause is faulty lubrication of the dust-
exposed, hard working chassis bearings, and
faulty lubrication can come from an inefficient
system just as easily as from neglect.
Alemite Lubrication Easy
and Positive
This is why the Alemite High Pressure Lubri-
cation System is in use today on more than
10,000,000 motor cars. Why 93 out of every
100 American-made cars are equipped with it
before they leave the factories.
The Alemite System is easy to use. All the
chassis bearings on a car can be lubricated in
a few minutes. And it means positive lubri-
cation. You always know that the lubricant
gets to the spot every time and stays there.
A small sum will equip your car
with Alemite
If your car is already equipped with the Ale-
mite System, use it every 500 miles. Lubricate
the bearings yourself or have your service
man do the work for you.
And if your car is not so equipped you can
have the System installed for a very small
amount of money. It merely means placing a
small, dust-proof Alemite fitting on each bear-
ing in place of the old-fashioned grease or oil cup.
How the System Works
The operation of the Alemite System is sim-
plicity itself. The handy Alemite compressor
gun containing the lubricant is attached to
the fitting on each bearing in turn. A twist of
the wrist forces c lean, fresh lubrican t en-
tirely through the bearing. Old, gritty grease
is forced out at the same time. That’s all there
is to it.
If your regular service man cannot supply you
with Alemite fittings or any of the other Ale-
mite Products shown at the left, write to any
of the distributors listed.

the lather is over 150
times as great as the

sufficient to last the
average man at least
150 shaves, which

What a lovely
Gift! ”
The Pale Priest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ABOVE the rust-black robe, his long,
white face
Is finely etched, as though the warring
soul
Had triumphed there, and left no single trace
Of grosser things, but found a heavenly
goal.
In some dark, suffering place he walks alone,
Companied only by the memory
Of One whom lie from childhood’s day has
known—
The lonely Man who hung upon the Tree!
He hears the Sanctus bell. The lights grow
dim ;
The purple-clouded incense wavers by.
The lonely Figure moves and draws near
him.
Drawn by that inescapable old tie.
Sweet singers chant aloft, each answering
each ;
The muffled music dies, then mounts
again ;
His hands, tormented, grope until they reach
The fount of his imperishable pain.
Out in the golden light of joyous day,
He sees life pass him. touched with agony;
For dark behind the children while they
play
He glimpses still the black, shame-sodden
Tree!
Beauty breaks round him, but he dare not
find
The hyacinthine prints where it has lain.
His eyes, dream-haunted, mystical, are blind
From too much looking on the Man of
Pain.
O pale priest, I would put within your hand
One rare, red rose, so you should soon
forget
That sad companionship that makes demand
On all your soul’s white worship! I would
set
The song of mating birds within your head !
And I would pluck from out your memory
That pitiful Man of Grief, and plant instead
The image of some white, bee-haunted
tree!

MYRA MORRIS.
Corpse’s Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TIMMY WOODS slipped from under some
I tarpaulins in a truck, ducked through a
0 goods shed, and stood looking up the
dusty main street of Murramburra. He had
not particularly wanted to get out there, but
the goods train seemed too tired to go any
further.
Murramburra was a typical township of
the sheep country in Westralia —seven or
eight pubs, a couple of stores and a few
houses whose corrugated-iron roofs shim-
mered and blazed in the sunlight. Between
them mobs of goats and long-tailed sheep
lazily wandered among heaps of old tins and
bottles and the mounds of earth turned up in
some long-forgotten gold rush. A relic of the
rush, an old poppet head, still raised stark
timbers to the flaring sky.
Beyond the township stretched a bare, red
countryside on which hairy tufts of scrub
straggled untidily. And behind it all the dis-
tant blue hills rippled fantastically through
the heat haze.
Jimmy had never seen anything like it
before, and the huge prodigality of the sun-
shine astounded him. Standing bewildered
there, he seemed as out of place as a camel
in a boghole. His Englishness was startling
and the red beef of his homeland was still in
his cheeks.
Near him was the main store with a little
group of men in front, squatting about or
leaning against the verandah-posts, smoking
and spitting and talking the interminable talk
of the bushman when he foregathers. Jimmy
wandered over. Several of the men inquired
“How’s she goin’?”—the universal salutation.
Jimmy didn’t quite know what they meant,
but answered politely, “She’s very well, thank
you.” After that they lost interest in him.
Jimmy’s attention became engrossed in two
camels harnessed to a spring-cart standing
outside the store. The aloof superciliousness
of the beasts, their great cushioned feet, their
humps, their long necks and most inadequate-
looking hindquarters astounded him. Then
presently he began to catch disconnected
words and phrases from the group behind him
—“G01d.... two months’ trip.... Boonooka
way.” There was a short silence, and some-
one asked who was going to win the Mel-
bourne Cup.
Jimmy had never seen a Melbourne Cup,
but the mention of gold was enough to set
him picturing nuggets of gold waiting to be
picked up. Here at last was the Australia
of which he had dreamed!
His imaginings were suddenly interrupted
by an exceedingly tipsy old man, clad in a
greasy flannel shirt and faded dungarees, who
shouted to the camels. The beasts sobbed
and grunted qs they started into their collars.
“Off on yer own again, Jack, y’ old hat-
ter?” sang out Jack Byne, the little dark
overseer of Mukkabunna station.
Jimmy listened wonderingly, and then,
as he realised that the old man was pro-
bably after gold, a wild idea entered his head.
For several minutes he waited in the road,
watching the dancing heatwaves swallow up
the cart, then strolled away from the group,
walked behind a row of tin shanties and
bolted into a tangled thicket of kararas, keep-
ing just on the edge of them so as not to
lose sight of the outfit.
All the afternoon Jimmy followed the
walking camels, dodging between bushes,
behind rocks, behind little stony ridges. And
all the time the. sun’s rays poured down until
he was blinded and buffeted by the heat and
the glare. His feet ached; his tongue was
like old leather and his head felt empty and
swollen as a balloon.
At sundown the old man halted at a wind-
mill, the only water within a radius of 10
miles, took out his camels, lit a fire and
nulled a billyful of cool water from the well.
The sight of it finished Jimmy. He came
from behind a big granite rock and went up
to the old prospector.
‘‘Who in liell are you?” asked the old man.
staring at Jimmy and almost dropping his
water in amazement. “Hang me if the bush
is worth living in nowadays; might as well
be in town. They ain't started a home fer
waifs and strays here, have they?”
“N-no,” replied Jimmy doubtfully; and
then suddenly added, “For God's sake give
me a drink. I’m almost done.”
The old man slowly gave him the billy and
watched him tip it further and further back,
till the water spilt over his thick tweed
coat.
“Lost, are yer?” he asked, more kindly,
when the boy had finished.
“No,” replied Jimmy, beginning to gain
confidence. “I’ve followed you. I’m after
gold, and I heard you were after it, too; so
I came.”
“Damme if this don’t beat hailstones in
Hell,” ejaculated Old Jack, amazed at the
youth’s simplicity. “You ain’t a jaekeroo
off a station, are yer?" he added Suspiciously.
“Can yous cook? Tail camels? Use a pick
and shovel or a shaker? Ain’t there nothin'
at all yous can do?” The old man paused
and looked so fiercely at Jimmy under the
tangled white wilderness of his eyebrows that
the boy. almost startled into terror, began to
remember tales of cannibalism he had read
in books about Australia. Then Old Jack
continued, so suddenly and so irritably that
Jimmy jumped, despite his’ aching feet.
“What th' hell are yous standin’there for?
Put some wood on the fire. I gotta make a
damper after tea. You’ll have to move yer-
self, young feller, or yer won’t stop long with
me.”
Jimmy was engaged.
They struck up an odd friendship, these
two ; the one so young and fresh and enthusi-
astic, the other so old and weary and worn
with toilsome experiences. And Jimmy soon
got into the way of things; the imported
Englishman seems hopeless at first, but he
soon learns. Old Jack taught the boy many
things about prospecting. The old chap was
a natural buslnnan, with almost the bush
instinct of an aboriginal. This was con-
tinually useful, as they were always on the
move, lured on by the hope of gold. It was
all a gamble ; they might strike pay dirt on
the next ridge, even in the next shovelful,
and, as Jimmy came to realise, they might
never strike it at all.
So they toiled through the ardent summer
days, and hope was their only encourage-
ment. The work was incredibly wearisome,
and after a time even Jimmy, to whom it
was all so amazingly new, and who at first
had enjoyed it thoroughly, found it mono-
tonous.
Yet. however much the days wearied him.
the nights he- always enjoyed. Old Jack,
once his pipe was drawing well, would tell
wonderful yarns of things undreamed of by
the Englishman ; yarns of adventure in the
inmost places of Australia, of droving trips,
of skirmishes with the natives, of “perishes”
and horses and riders and cattle and dogs.
To him they were commonplaces ; to Jimmy
they opened up a wonderland of romance.
And gradually Jimmy, increasingly less
diffident, told bis own unsensational story.
He was an orphan and had been raised in
an orphanage; then he had been anything
from paper-boy to hop-picker; always un-
lucky, never able to get on. In England,
waiting for him to make good, was a little
factory girl who, somehow or other, kept an
invalid mother. She, as their only chance,
had persuaded him to come out to Aus-
tralia. In the meantime she was toiling and
waiting with an almost pathetic confidence
in Jimmy’s ability to succeed.
So they worked on, week after week, month
after month, prospecting, shovelling, dryblow-
ing and for ever travelling. They still hoped;
but the zest seemed to have gone out of the
gamble.
Sometimes they shot kangaroos at night,
as the animals came into the wells and water-
holes, and the sale of the skins kept them
in tea and flour and their few other neces-
sities. The summer had not broken, and the
country still sweltered in the heat. They
travelled through a country where every-
thing was endlessly the same; the grey-green
scrub, the low granite outcrops, the ridges
and white breakaways —an unlovely land,
stretching in dull billows to the flickering
horizon. The monotony, the awful loneli-
ness and the uselessness of it all began to
weigh Jimmy down. He longed for company,
excitement, noise—anything to break the
weary sameness.
Even Old Jack, hardened to it all. became
liverish and irritable, and sometimes for days
hardly spoke, except blasphemously to the
camels.
Then at last they pulled into Meekatharra,
the terminus of tlie long and dreary Mur-
chison railway, where Jimmy determined his
prospecting days would end. All his illu-
sions of nuggets and veins of gold had gone,
the way of the whirlwind’s dust, and he had
decided that the small yet certain wages of
a station would be better than mere phantoms
of wealth.
At the post-office he had a letter from
Her—an ill-writ and pathetic letter but to
Jimmy the finest piece of literature ever
penned. He read it through again and again,
and then sat gloomily on the edge of the
verandah of the hotel, the letter still clutched
in his hand. She was so confident that he
was doing something to put her beyond
poverty and endless work. And he had
earned nothing.. . .
He stared drearily across the moon-splashed
bush, dreaming longingly of England and
the girl who waited there in a grimy grey
street of a factory town. He must do some-
thing for her—but what could lie do?
As he sat there Old Jack returned, sat
down beside him, and. without speaking, be-
gan the long and solemn rite of emptying
and renewing his pipe.
They sat thus for a long time, and then
Old Jack’s voice came booming through the
barrage of smoke about him. “Mulga wire’s
just come in,” he said. “They reckon gold’s
been found across the desert at Corpse’s Hill.
I went near there once with Wallace’s
party.” He paused for so long that Jimmy
thought he had dozed off; then he began
again. “Them sort of yarns is always coinin’
in. No one knows who’s found it, nor where
it is; but I always kinder reckoned there
was gold there somewhere.” He paused
again and spat reflectively. “It ain’t never
been prospected any that I kuow of. It's

Eczema i
ZAM-BUK Will Soon Clear Your Skin.
AS Zam-Buk represents the result of years of
study of skin disease, this great herbal balm
can always be relied upon in cases of fiery eczema
or any itching or inflammatory symptoms.
The world-wide success of Zam-Buk is due to its
unique formula. Zam-Buk contains valuable herbal
essences which are so highly refined that they are
readily absorbed by the tiny pores of . the skin.
Thus Zam-Buk heals from below by reaching under-
lying tissues where disease has its root.
Powerfully antiseptic and agreeably soothing,
Zam-Buk quickly allays irritation. It subdues
inflammation, kills and expels disease germs, and after
thoroughly cleansing the tissues, induces Nature to
grow new healthy skin.
Zam-Buk is absolutely unequalled for pimples,
rashes, eczema, ulcers, abscesses, poisoned wounds,
bad legs, psoriasis, piles, cuts, bruises, burns and
scalds,

Mrs. R. Jones, of Donation Lane, Toowoomba,
Queensland. “Caused through scratching a
tiny spot on my skin, it ultimately spread
all over my body. The fiery itching was
intense and I felt like tearing my skin to
pieces. Though 1 tried all sorts of prepara-
tions, there was no improvement until I used
Zam-Buk. This soon put an end to the burn-
ing and itching. It purified the tissues and
grew new healthy skin."
ZAM-BUK WINS

Mr. T. D. Kyle,
of “Cathay,”
Belmont Road,
Char lestown,
near Newcastle, N.S.W., says: “For years 1
suffered from eczema on my left leg, and the
persistent irritation was frightful. A small
fortune went in ointments. I was in hospital
for months. 1 thought 1 would never be free
of the eczema. It was a hard fight, even for
Zam-Buk, but after a time I could see im-
provement. This got me to keep on with
the balm. Now, the old sores are all healed
and my skin is perfectly clear.”

as fur as Hell, and there ain’t no water.. ..
But I'm goin’.... Will yous come aiong
Jimmy stood up and crushed the letter
in his hand until his fingernails dug into
the flesh.
“Yes,” he said suddenly, “I’ll come!
So in a few days they started out with
three pack camels; one laden with gear and
provisions and the others with water in four
Hat 250-gallon tanks, slung on each side
of the pack saddles. At Dingo Springs they
tilled their tanks for the last time and began
the weary journey through the desert.
Four days it took them, the sand billowing
everlastingly before them; ridge after ridge,
loose and dun-colored, so that they were con-
fronted by an endless visual contraction
and expansion of sand —a blinding glare of
shimmering ridges and, as they plunged into
a depression, a blistering concavity of sand.
They looked forward to night as an oasis
after the weary day. Once, by the light of
the full moon, Jimmy showed his precious
letter to Old Jack. And the prospector
understood Jimmy then as he had never
understood him before. For he had once
received just such a letter. Nearly all that
night he lay awake* thinking of Mary
O’Flynn, bonny Mary, who had died, so they
told him afterwards, of a broken heart. But
that had been years and years ago, when the
world had seemed a playground, and the love
of women a light thing. .. .
Then at last they saw the blue peak of
Corpse's Hill loom through the dancing heat
haze and come nearer and nearer until
its color changed to red. In time they
reached its rugged sides. Over these they
toiled painfully during the days that fol-
lowed, until, in a dried-up, rocky creek-bed,
they found alluvial gold.
Old Jack was immensely cheered. “There
must be a big reef somewhere what this stuff
comes from,” he explained to Jimmy. “But
we gotta go like the hammers of Hell,” he
added, “or we won’t find it afore that water
gives out.”
So they searched and toiled almost night
and day, until at last, high up in a deep
cleft of the hill, they found what they had
been seeking—Old Jack all his life; Jimmy,
it seemed to him, for years. It was a reef
of white quartz rising almost six inches
above the weather-smoothed rock, and it was
seamed and studded with gold.
“God A’mighty!” yelled Old Jack joy-
fully. “May I go hoppin’ to Hell if there
ain’t more gold here than Kalgoorlie ever
seen!”
And while he chipped specimens from the
reef and gloated over them, Jimmy capered
madly about the bare, red rock.
For hours, until the dusk had come, they
examined and re-examined every part of the
outcrop, and found it richer even than they
had at first imagined. Then they went back
to the camp, each, the first enthusiasm some-
what sobered, thinking of what the gold
meant to him. Jimmy thought poignantly of
England; Old Jack of a tiny farm nestling
greenly in the bend of a placid river, far
in the cool south.
“Good God!” cried Jimmy suddenly when
they came within sight of the camp. “Where’s
the tank? It’s gone!”
He ran forward, Old Jack close behind,
and was horror-stricken to discover that a
chance wind-devil had flung the tank from
between the two rocks that had sheltered it.
Only a damp spot on the sand showed where
the water had dribbled out of the half-
screwed-in bung.
Jimmy’s knees seemed to give way sud-
denly, and he sat down on a butt of flour.
“Done, done, done!” he intoned again and
again, dully, hopelessly.
“Hey, yous don't want to give in that-
away,” said Old Jack as cheerfully as he
could, smiting Jim’s bowed back with his
heavy hand. “We got a chance, a good
chance. See here. That there bung’s an
inch from the side, an’ we got that depth of
water. That lot’ll fill our bags and see us
as fur as Jackson’s Soak. We can fill ’em
again there and get in easy. Come on! Get
up! We got no time to waste.”
“What about the camels?” inquired Jimmy,
wearily getting to his feet.
“Duuno where they are, an’ we ain’t got no
time to look for ’em; anyroad, they ain’t
ridin’ camels.”
And so swiftly they filled the four big
water-bags, packed together some tucker, and
set out for Jackson's Soak.
Two days later, in that indeterminate
time between sunset and darkness, they
reached it.
“Under that bank we’ll ’ave to dig,” said
Old Jack hoarsely.
They dug frenziedly, sending up the fine
sand in filmy showers. The short twilight
deepened, stars came out, and still the two
men dug, deeper and deeper. At last Old
Jack stood up.
“It’s no go. Jimmy me lad,” he said,
touelessly. “She’s dried up. How much
water we got left?”
“Bag and a half,” answered Jimmy, almost
in a whisper.
Old Jack sighed and sat down in the bed
of the creek. “Anyroad,” he remarked, “we’ll
’ave to ’ave a rest ’ere. We bin goin’ a
long time. I’m done.”
They started again at the first slow paling
of the dawn, and Jimmy noticed that the
old man was limping.
“I got that bloody rbenmatiz on me again ;
can’t get along nohow,” he explained.
“Come along,” said Jimmy anxiously.
“Lean on my shoulder.” And thus they pain-
fully hobbled along for a few hundred yards.
“No go, Jimmy; I’m done in,” said Old
Jack, faintly, at length. “I’ll have to stop.”
“But —but, you must come. I can’t leave
you here to”—the boy boggled at the word —
“to die.”
“You got to,” replied the old man calmly.
■‘lt’s the on’y way. There’s jest enough
water for one man; so, d’ye see, you gotta
push on an’ send back a relief party fer me.”
“But you’ll have to wait about four days,
maybe more. Here; take this bag, and i’ll
chance it with the rest.”
“No, no, take it. damn you!” bellowed the
old prospector. “It’s our on’y chance. Think
an old bushie like me can’t last four or
five days without water? Hop off while
it’s cool. I’ll do a bit of prospectin’ round
till you come back.” lie tried to laugh, but
his parched throat was too dry.
As soon us he had disappeared Old Jack
strolled back to (he dry soak with his usual
rolling', springy step.
Two long, sweltering days had passed.
The sun was just sinking like a drop of blood
slowly oozing into a sea of lire. An old man
was kneeling on the red, sunset-stained sands.
He looked very small and lonely, silhouetted
against the angry sunset, surrounded by
the empty waste of sand. His work-seamed
hands were clenched and raised stiffly above
his head.
“God!” The word came strangely from
his cracked and swollen lips, from which the
blood started and trickled in crimson streams
over his chin and down his white beard.
He paused. How could he pray to God?
He who had blasphemed and mocked at bis
name for fifty years? Then suddenly lie
started again, and his worn face became very
tender as he went on in a hoarse, barely -
audible whisper:
“Oh. Mary ! Mary O’Flynn ! Forgive me
for what I done.... I’ve paid. God knows
I’ve paid. Mary! If so be you can. help
Jimmy to get in’’ (he lowered his voice to
a mere breath) “for his girl’s sake.”
Again he paused; then cried piteously,
lifting his haggard, blood-stained face to
the hot skies: “Oh, Mary! Forgive an’ help
me! I done....what I could. I’m cornin’.”
He sank gently down, paused, then
sprawled backwards on the sand.
FRANK FARMER.
The Best Policy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WELL, there’s one thing I can say, I’ve
always -un straight. I’ve been rulin’
more ’an fifteen years an’ I never put
any think over on nobody, see? I’m feelin’
dead crook now, an’ somehow I’m glad I
been a straightgoer. Not like a lot of em,
I obeyed the man I rode for; I done wot he
wanted an’ I never put it acrost ’im. If he
wasn’t havin’ a go he didn’t ’ave to back ’is
’orse just in case, see?
Listen. I was a ’orseman, I knew wot me
’ands was for —-an’ me arms. I don’t want
to blow me bags out, but I’ve pulled a few
owners outa the muck because I knew me
job an’ obeyed instructions. I was straight,
I was. It don’t pay to go crook in the long
run. Me mother used to ’ave a great sayin’;
she useter say: “Honesty’s the best policy.”
I’ve never forgot that, not even when I
coulda put a bit in me kick.
I knew plenty o’ riders wot weren’t din-
kum; stopped their mounts when they coulda
won, an’, worse ’an that, won when they
shoulda been nowhere. An’ where are they
now? Down and out. But I’ll bet yer any
owner I’ve rode for will say about me:
“Poor old Tim, he was some ’orseman. All
I ’ad to do was tell ’im where I wanted me
’orse at any part of the race, an’ where I
wanted ’im at the finish, an’ there he was.”
Yer see, I don’t want to blow me bags out,
but they knew they could trust me.
Listen. If any of the liars said to me face
wot they’re sayin’ behind me back I couldn't
keep me ’ands off ’em. Sayin’ Up-to-Snuff
fell in the Cup because I took ’old of ’im
sudden at the turn, an’ that me broken ’ead
an’ fractured leg is wot I was askin' for!
But Mr. Landsale, the owner, don’t think
that, an' Dick Wells, the trainer, don’t.
Dick told me. He’s been to see me twice
since I bin busted up. We’re cobbers.
Dick says he blames hisself. Yer sec, it
was this way. About three munce ago Dick
comes to me, see? He says, “Up-to-Snuff is
doing great work. He’s a true stayer all
right, an’ old Landsale w-ants to keep ’im
for the City Cup. Of course, he’ll start
in the Spring Stakes and Magill ’Aiidicap
to make a good market for ’im in the Cup.
We want you to ride ’im, Tim,” he says. It
just shows yer ’ow they trusted me. Dick
said. “When he loses them two ’andicaps we
oughter get a great price about ’im in the
Cup; an’, o’ course, Tim, you’re on.”
Well. I rode Up-to-Snuff in them two
'andicaps. He ’ad a terrible soft mouth.
It didn’t take much to ease ’im up, but he
didn’t like it. He’d go crook —sorter do his
block. My instructions was to make it look
as if he couldn’t stay'the Cup distance. An’
that’s just wot I done. I kept ’im in a good
possie to the turn, where I came away ; but
at the top of the straight I faded out. They
was terrible pleased at the way I ’andled
the ’orse in them two ’andicaps, both Mr.
Landsale and Dick. So they backed ’im to
win a poultice in the Cup.
On Cup morn in yer could get, if yer re-
member, yer own price about Up-to-Snuff.
Gor lummy. I’d a wonderful passage in the
race. At the turn I'm lyin’ third an' take
the lead when I like. At the top o’ the
straight I gets up to ride ’im. He stops. I
shoots on to his ears an’ down we go, an’
the next I remember I’m in ’orspital. see?
Dick saw it through his glasses an' he
blames hisself for wot ’appened. When he
came to see me in ’orspital the first thing he
said was, “Tim, it was all my fault. I
shoulda told you not to stop ’im in the same
place in the two ’andicaps. Yer see, Tim.”
he says, “we educated ’im in the ’andicaps
to stop at the top of the straight; an’ when
you got up to ride ’im in the Cup at that
spot he thought you was goin’ to pull his
’ead orf, so he stopped hisself. An’ that's
’ow the crash ’appened.” It’s pretty ’ard
’ow a rotten ’orse like that can .give a
jockey a bad name an’ nearly kill ’im into
the bargain. After all that’s been done for
me I wouldn’t put a tale up on yer: and if
anyone tells yer that Tim Toon isn’t
straight yer can tell ’em yer know different.
But. after all. I’ve rode me last race. I’m
goin’ into Dick’s stable to take on trainin’,
an’ they’ll find me just as straight a trainer
like I was as a rider.
Listen, an’ I’ll put yer on to the best thing
yer ever ’ad in yer life. Dick’s got the win-
ner of the next Grand National in his stable.
His name’s Breakneck! Yer laugh, but w r ait
till I tell yer; yer know what a black beauty
Breakneck is to look at. and what a rotten
fencer lie is. Well, he won't start. But
you’ve ’eard of Homespun wot won the two
big steeplechases up north. (I know yer
won’t spill it.) Well, he’s the dead ring of
Breakneck; but he’s a chestnut. Listen.
Mr. Landsale bought Homespun last week,
an’ Dick an’ me are goin’ to prepare 'im for
the National. He won’t be a chestnut: wliei
we’ve finished with him.

PERFECT
IN EVERY FART
CROUPS
The manner in which Exide Plates are built up
into groups allows full advantage to be taken of
their high efficiency.
Each plate is independently welded to equaliser
bars, having massive pillars, which ensures
minimum resistance to heavy starting current
and an easy start every time.
