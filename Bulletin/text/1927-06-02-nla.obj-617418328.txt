Status for the Author
Recently an American novelist arrived
unheralded in Sydney and sought out the
literary men of the city. For a while he
sought in vain: there were no headquarters
of the literary craft; no association of
writers to welcome him; and he had never
heard—nor was likely to have heard—of
the Authors’ section of the A.J.A. He won-
dered vaguely whether the breed of authors
had died out; yet he had heard of novels
having actually been written and even pub-
lished in this continent. By sheer luck he
ran into an Australian black-and-white man,
who led him to the only literary shrine in
this city of a million inhabitants, the Press
Club. But thougji he was made welcome
—he was a good fellow—as the Press Club
has a habit of doing, or overdoing, he failed
to discover any Australian authors on the
premises. Ultimately he found a few speci-
mens of the literary craft still extant; and
on his return to the U.S.A. he promises to
announce his discovery. Previously when
Somerset Maugham looked in on Sydney
he made similar inquiries; and he was
welcomed, and warmly, not, however, by
the literary craft, but by the Society of
Artists! That was the best that Sydney
could do for literature. A few literary men
were discovered and invited to the little
luncheon in his honor. All honor to the
artists!
Years ago both art and literature existed
in Sydney, but the artists became dissatis-
fied with their low standing in the com-
munity, and they set to work, led by a
business man who was also an artist, to
put the paint business upon a better and
more business-like basis. One of the aims
of this body was to increase the prices for
their pictures by means of energetic pub-
licity. And, thanks chiefly to Sydney Ure
Smith, look what has happened! The artists
have become almost leading citizens—at
least they' are recognised as , a body that
has to be regarded as part of the life of
the city. Energy and organisation have
wrought this apparent miracle.
Meantime the literary - men remain
secluded in their modesty. They cut no
figure in the progress and prosperity of
the city. At public functions the artists
appear as an important body; their various
exhibitions are well patronised; and Aus-
tralian artists returning from the Continent
are assured of a civic reception, and have the
patronage of Government House, and the
entree to what society we possess. It is
easy to disdain these meretricious adorn-
ments; but they count, both in publicity
and in cash. What the artist fraternity has
done can just as easily be done by the
literary class. Organisation is all that is
needed to lift the author to the plane
already occupied by the artist; and the
artist w T ould be eager to assist in this
merited endeavor.
Furnley Maurice (R.P. 19/5/’27) has
suggested a definite scheme for the encour-
agement of Australian poetry—and poets
—.that seems ineffective. Magnates are re-
quired to subscribe to a fund to enable the
formation of another fund to give an annual
prize for poetry, the judges to be
literary critics. I venture with diffidence
to point out that any such committee would
necessarily include the leading authors and
critics, as well as our best poets; and event-
ually the committee would have to award
the annual prize to one of its members.
If a literary critic not upon the committee
were delegated the task of choosing the
best poem or novel of the year, his task
would be as hopeless as that of the pro-
fessor who awarded the Canberra Ode com-
petition arranged by the S. M. Herald. But
would any other literary judge have suc-
ceeded any better?
What is needed is no such isolated stunt
as the selection of the best poem, book
of poetry, play or novel of each year.
Such achievements carry us no further in
the establishment of the writer’s craft:
what is urgently needed is an effort to build
up a body that would possess the necessary
prestige to speak for Australian poetry in
general—and in public. We must admit
that the literary craft occupied a very low
plane in the cultural activities of the city
or State or Commonwealth. There is at
present no prestige for even a great author
or poet—and who shall say that there is
not now amongst us such a poet or novelist,?
Obviously the only books that find publi-
cation are those thajt appeal to the general
public, or those that are published at the
authors expense. What is urgently needed
is the building up af a body similar to the
Society of Artists or the Art Society to
speak for Australian literature. Such a
P°dy, properly run and organised, would
m time achieve a position similar to those
of the artists’ organisations. Organisation
must _ come first, with a business-minded
organiser who need : not be a poet. If a
magnate happens alohg with the necessarv
funds he would be welcomed; but without
that problematic help the Australian
Authors Association should be able “to exist
and progress. The principle is self-help.
Let s get going to fonm the fiVst provisional
committee, and the necessary press publicity
will follow.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
Mud and Morals
No normal, rational man likes mud; and
no one can deny that a vast amount of mud
is thrown about, to-day 1 as so-called art and
literature. Speculators grow rich out of
films, plays, books and magazines delibe-
rately designed to appeal to the corrupt
taste of defectives and degenerates. Decent-
minded people, who naturally abominate
filth in any form, feel that-something should
be done to remove the rubbish. Hence the
demand for censorship, and more censor-
ship, is continually growing, even in tolerant
Australia. “Stop this rotten film!” the people
cry. “Burn this dirty book I” Their instinct
is right; for fundamentally all good art and
literature is moral, life-invigorating, not life-
debasing. But how to cure the evil is not
an easy problem. Laws have proved in
vain, and the appointment of a Cato the
Censor, or a Comstock, has always resulted
in a ghastly failure. The United States, the
country of prohibition, is also the country of
bootlegging. Recently frantic efforts have
been made by organised and influential
bodies to clean up the stage and the book-
stalls; but according to leading authorities
conditions have never been worse. On the
stage the glorification of license and perver-
sion is a box-office attraction; some of the
movies are disgraceful; and spicier papers
can.be found openly on a New York book-
stall than on the Parisian boulevards.
The Puritans have defeated their own
purpose by wrong-headed methods. Instead
of directing their attacks against what was
obviously pornographic, they Went out of
their way to challenge books and plays that
the majority of decent cultured citizens
deemed praiseworthy. Men of undoubted
integrity like Mencken, Cabell, Dreiser and
Eugene O’Neill were assailed by official
censors, while the merchants of mud escaped.
When a company playing “Desire Under the
Elms,” which good English critics regard as
perhaps the best play yet written in America,
was arrested in Los Angeles by the city
authorities, O’Neill’s Only remark was the
vague question: “Isn’t Los Angeles the place
where the motion pictures are made?” The
Puritans, however well-meaning they might
be in theory, showed themselves so stupid
and such a menace to. freedom of thought
that their forces were ignominiously routed.
The country has turned against them, and
the result is that they are now unable to
find funds to carry on their proper and
necessary job.
But this has always been the case with the
censorship. History proves clearly that it is
too dangerous a weapon for a few individuals
to play with. It can be used for political
or theological purposes with devastating
effect. It wasn’t on moral grounds that it
was revived by Sir Robert Walpole, but to
prevent the exposure of his policy of whole-
sale bribery. The greatest historical example-
on record was the closing of the theatres
by the Puritans at the Civil Wars, the
theatres, as it happened, of Shakspeare and
his fellows, that are now honored as a chief
glory of English letters. When a Puritan
like Milton, who cannot be accused of a
movie taste, arises in wrath to blast the
Comstocks of his day, there must be some-
thing wrong with the institution itself.
Too much censorship would be a curse
in Australia, which has always prided itself
on its love of liberty. We don’t want boot-
legging in pornographic literature. After
all, it is only morons who like mud, and
the solution of the problem is to get rid
of the morons, by education if possible, till
there is no market for literary or theatrical
mud.
LOUIS ESSON.
Is It Morals We Need?
Almost all our “serious-minded” novelists
have become of late the teachers of a
strange doctrine, which for want of a better
name ma> r be called the Doctrine of With-
holding Judgment. Hutchinson set the
fashion in “If Winter Comes,” and since
then the heroes of most writers have been
of the Mark Sabre variety—puzzled, philo-
sophic, gently detached people, who find
a difficulty in giving a decision about any-
thing.
The appeal of such novels probably lies
in the fact that many people, faced with
the complications of modern life, are find-
ing themselves in agreement with the
authors. It is more comfortable and more
“broadminded” to adopt the attitude de-
scribed. And yet surely this policy of say-
ing “It is impossible to make up one’s
mind; one cannot see far enough; it is all
so difficult,” can be carried too far. It
must be very dangerous, too, in that it
impedes action, destroys older ideals and
prevents the tentative mapping-out of a
course through life, leaving one at the
mercy of things which “happen,” leaving
one to be the unresisting buffet of fate.
Especially does the doctrine seem vicious
and inadequate when applied to the per-
sonal relations between men and women.
We need to have some opinion on this
subject. And the problem ought not to
be insoluble. Perhaps we have been try-
ing the wrong formula? The book which
I have just laid down, and which gave rise
to this train of thought, deals with the

DAVID JONES’
For Service—Sydney
history of a man who was supported by a
rich woman as her paramour. But, urges
the author, he must not be condemned for
this; in all respects he was a normal,
‘•straight” young man, and only the relent-
less force of circumstance led to his adop-
tion of this invidious mode of hie Ihe
same book tells of a woman who, beref,
of her husband in the war, became the
mistress of a rich merchant and subse-
quently indulged in two other intrigues
with different men, though her establish-
ment was still being paid ioi by her hist
lover. And again the author takes pains
1o represent her as being ot the finest prin-
ciples and in fact a veritable flowei of
womanhood.
Now why is there so much effort to prove
this? Why is the point labored? It seems
indubitable that people who live “ambigu-
ous” lives may be very attractive, very
generous, may have most of the qualities
that humanity values and admires. But
it is rather humorous to observe them try-
ing to make up their minds whether their
course of action is right or wrong.
Is it not time that love-affairs and en-
tanglements were removed from the sphere
of morals, properly so-called? Whether a
man or woman shall accept the tradition
of monogamy is surely a matter of per-
sonal taste. Commitments made to another
person should, of course, be honored. If
a man undertakes to support a woman
throughout life and to remain faithful to
her. etc., etc., then he is under bond to
keep his agreement; but there is no need
to create a special department for such
bonds. But, in the absence of such com-
mitments, wherein lies the “wrong”? The
elderly clergyman who, in the course of
his long and useful life, has three times
been married does not seem on inspection
to be of a worse or a better type than the
man who supports, concurrently, three mis-
tresses, presuming he has made no false
promises to any. Some prefer the successive,
some the simultaneous method, that is all.
The old clear-cut view of the “pure” and
the “impure,” meaning by the first those
who respected the marriage-bond and by
the second those who did not, is of no
help at all in these days. It was rooted
in the idea of private property, and ideas
of private property are changing.
In the last analysis, even promiscuity is
not a matter of right or wrong; it is a
matter of fastidiousness. There will always
be some people who are not very fussy
and there will always, in spite of the doubt-
ings and misgivings of our novelists, be
the dreamers who prefer to wait for a
companion of the spirit; again, there will
be the happy, volatile people who are con-
stitutionally disposed to fall in love with
a number of people in succession. The
querulous voice of an importunate con-
science will only reproach and recriminate.
It can offer no solution.
W. K. H.
Childhood’s Right to Gloom
“Country Ped.”: (R.P. 5/5/’27) does not
go far enough in stating that “anyone who
cuts off the flow of sentiment from children’s
reading is depriving them of half their
happiness.” He might add that it would
go a long way towards preventing them
from becoming kindly, generous men and
women. Experience and imagination are
the only means of learning sympathy for
pain or sorrow, and the mind of to-day
revolts from the former in regard to chil-
dren. Many people who have not begun
to consider themselves elderly were brought
up on the whip and the Hell-fire story, but
the time has gone (thank Heaven!) when
even the best of parents honestly thought
that to savagely maltreat a child’s body,
and terrorise its brain, was the only wav
to save its soul. A child should certainly
be shielded from real suffering as long as
possible, but while so shielded it has every
right to indulge in those dream-sorrows
which, like dream-wounds, leave no scar.
Ideal sorrows are not merely harmless
to a child who knows no real ones—they
are beneficial. A well-fed. warmly-clad
child weeping over “The Little Match-girl”
is suffering none of the physical horrors of
cold and hunger, yet is absorbing sympathy
for them as surely as if she had. A happy,
popular schoolgirl who has suffered in
imagination with a shabby and friendless
one in a book will have an impulse to show
kindliness when such a one comes to her
own school. The girl whose favorite heroine
was a tower of strength in a household
tragedy will probably try to emulate her
if the occasion arises, where the girl who
no such guide might be stunned into
uselessness.
Ihe wise child-trainer will not attempt
to interrupt the “luxury of woe” so long
as it spreads itself over human tragedies
which the child will one day be called
«»>on f° suffer or help, and steers clear of
Hell-fire bogies. The phase passes with the
growth of the wisdom teeth, and if Forty
ever recalls the soddsn hankies of Fourteen,
it is with a laugh.

anu naa given several trader and planter
cnaps a litt in to meet the steamer. After
the bustle and excitement caused by the
arrival of Burns-Philp’s old hooker Melusia,
the mails were sent ashore and sorted by
the D. 0., and our issue came aboard.
Amongst our letters was an imposing-
looking one addressed “Clifford W. Collin-
son, Esq., F.R.G.S.” “Colly” was one of
our passengers from Lambeti, and when he
spotted it he ripped it open with a yawp
of triumph. It proved to contain a cheque
from the Wide World for an article he’d
sent. That, of course, meant celebrations,
so all hands trooped ashore and along the
coral path past “8.-P.’s” to Fred Green’s
store and bar—the latter the only one in
200 miles or so. “Steamer day” in Gizo is
generally pretty wild, but the happenings
of the next 48 hours are history in that
sleepy port. Now comes Life and Laughter
’Midst the Cannibals (Hurst and Blackett),
a book by this same Collinson, in which he
tells in a wonderfully interesting way of
similar “steamer days” not only in Gizo,
but in most parts of the Group. It is a
book by a man who knows the Solomons
from Belfield’s to Buka; a book, moreover,
that is written with just that happy-go-
lucky, manana touch that is the spirit of
the place.
After casually meeting “Nick” (other-
wise C, B. Nicholson, District Officer at
Faisi) in Sydney, Collinson accepted an
invitation to pay him a visit. But it was
months before he sighted Faisi, for, making
the acquaintance of H. A. Markham on
the steamer, he disembarked with him at
Tetapari and sailed off to Leueneua in the
cutter Lily. “Marko” is celebrated as a
host in the Islands and has thousands of
friends, amongst whom he counted the late
Houdini—how they first met is told in the
book. He never lets a schooner pass his
fine plantation, Segi, in the Marovo Lagoon.
(The last time I was there he made me
stay nearly a week to recuperate from a
bad case of malarial gastritis.) The natives of
Lord Howe, as Leueneua is otherwise called,
are a lovable crowd, and Collinson seems to
have had a great time, as does any stranger.
Returning from Lord Howe, he was taken
under the wing of E. H. Pybus, of Vella
Lavella and Simbo, with whom he after-
wards went into partnership in a trading
venture. The natives of the Solomons are
fairly tame now and only very occasion-
ally break out to the extent of killing a
trader or labor overseer; but Collinson
dug up many an adventure in the villages.
But, to my mind, the book will be most
interesting to the island people themselves,
and will cause many a chuckle in trading
stations and plantations when the lonely
men fall suddenly across themselves. The
“towerists,” of course, come in for a lot of
leg-pulling, but that is one of the great
indoor sports of the Solomons. (Trippers,
by the way, are always “towerists.” It
started with Capt, Voy, of the old Mindini
and Marsina.)
The book will probably have the effect of
making most Sydney men decide early
to call at Burns-Philp’s for a passage to
Makambo or Faisi. But it ends rather
abruptly—as did the author’s stay there.
Like all the rest of us, he fell a victim to
malarial gastritis, and one day, weak and
sick, he happened into Gizo as a big Nor-
wegian tramp was loading, and decided
quite suddenly—they do things like that, in
the Solomons —to book a passage to Eng-
land. The tramp called at Nauru and
Balik Papan on the way, and Collinson
picked up one or two more yarns for his
book.
The illustrations are good and some are
taken by the author, but. there are one
or two which can be bought, in the form of
semi-decomposed postcards in 8.-P.’s store
in Faisi.

A Satchel of Books
Brittany and the Loire, by Leslie Richard-
son ( Bles). A record of impressions, artis-
tically illustrated, of the author’s explora-
tion of the interior of picturesque Brittany,
via the canal from Nantes to Brest.
My Life Story, by Joynton Smith (Angus
and Robertson). The autobiographer, who
started life as a pawnbroker’s rousepbout at
the age of 13 and is now a knight, an
M.L.C. of N. S. Wales and newspaper pro-
prietor, describes his book as “vagrant recol-
lections” that are “more a comic-song of
survival than a Psalm of Life.” It is as
full of the letter “I” as a pincushion of
pins, a fact which may be an unavoidable
characteristic of this form of book or may
be an index to the qualities which lifted the
writer from the pop-shop to Parliament.
The Divinity in Man, by John W. Graham
(Allen and Unwin). The author is a
prominent member of the Society of Friends
and his work throughout is tinged with the
mysticism of the Quaker religion. He dis-
sociates the spiritual from the natural world
and the soul of man from his physical being.
“Not until,” he says, “we realise that
spiritual things are spiritually discerned,
that God is the soul of all souls, and that
the soul of man is one of the atoms of his
substance, one of the cells of his organism,
shall we possess a mysticism that is true
enough to live in our own day and to help
the good to master the evil in our lives.”
This theme is illustrated by quotations from
many sources, from Plotinus to Wordsworth,
from Tennyson to Francis Thompson.
The Memoirs of Baron N. Wr angel
(Benn). These memoirs written by the
father of the Baron Wrangel who com-
manded the anti-Bolshevik armies derive
their interest from the fact that they cover
the field of transition from old Russia to new
Soviet. Born in 1547, the writer recalled
the end of the days of serfdom, and, living
to 1920, passed through the critical days of
the revolution. He paints the horrors of
the Bolshevik Terror in scarlet. “Before
1914 it was painful to see a dog run over.
Then every day one would see tens, hun-
dreds and thousands of men killed and muti-
lated, and amongst them friends, brothers,
one’s own children, and one got used to it.
. . . .The son of a friend told me that one day
he had suddenly come into a district where
he had found 12 Bolsheviks torturing a
family. They had tied a pot with a rat in
it to tlie mother’s stomach, and the rat was
gnawing her entrails. The hands of the
wretched woman were nailed to a table, on
•which two young children of hers, who were
still alive, were tied to a plate with a knife
and fork through their bodies. They had
already had their eyes gouged out.” In
this case vengeance struck swiftly; the nar-
rator was in Yudenitsch's army and he
hanged ail the monsters, some with his own
hands. A simply written and graphic record
from which the writer has evidently en-
deavored to exclude class bias.
The Letters of an Individualist, by
Ernest J. P. Benn (Benn). These letters
by a member of one of the principal London
publishing houses are “a plea for a return
to individualism, for a re-acceptance of the
sturdy sense of personal responsibility which
alone brought us out of barbarism into civi-
lisation.” They constitute a plea that we
should “save ourselves from the degradation
of the idea that man has rights without
responsibilities, and that we should cease
from the disastrous sacrifice of everything
that matters by tlie fostering of the false
notion that the State Idol can give us a
dispensation from the trouble of work.” At
the root of the widespread unemployment in
Britain Sir Ernest Benn sees something more
than the dislocation of commerce and indus-
try arising out of post-war conditions. He
traces it to four causes: (1) The perverted
mentality which regards a job as if it were
an end in itself; (2)the restrictions and
limitations with which industrial and com-
mercial activity has been surrounded (“limi-
tation of production pushes up prices for the
ever-diminisliing few who can afford to pay,
but it inflicts a cruel punishment on the
many, whether consumers or workers, who
are thus robbed either of comforts or
work”) ; (3) the pretensions of political
parties which convey to the people the false
impression that it is the duty of somebody
else to provide them with work or main-
tenance; and (4) high taxation. Well worth
perusal.
R. D. Fitz Gerald is disturbed by a state-
ment of his which the Red Page printed in
reference to his London award for verse:
“I don’t think any of the recipients place
much value on the award.” He is anxious
to explain that it was not the award he had
in his mind, but the publicity. Some of the
biggest literary guns in England—Rliys and
Drinkwater for instance —are judges in the
Pan ton Club’s literary competitions.
“NF”: ”1 sailed with Conrad!” “Ben
Gun’s” contribution (R.P. 12/5/’27 ), and more
particularly his concluding,' words, remind
me. One summer’s night three years ago 1
was drifting about St. Vincent’s Gulf in a
yacht, and, the conversation turning on
things nautical, one of the crew. Harry
S , mentioned some happening when
lie was a sailor on the Torrens. To my
question, “Did you ever sail with a mate
named Conrad?” he answered “Yes, and
entered on a description of the novelist, his
looks, his manners and, needless to say, his
ability as a sailor, giving a description that
tallied with “Ben Gun’s.” To a further ques-
tion as to what became of this mate, I was told
that he left the Torrens in London and
then: “I did hear that lie made a lot of
money afterwards, writing books.” In
answer to the very natural question. “But
haven’t you read any of them, Harry !' came
the same reply as “Ken Gun would make.
My friend’s abstention from the study of
Conrad I can understand, but “Ben Gun's”
confession makes me wonder why.
“Maunga”: There is a lot of the witch and
seer in a poet, and one-time Bulletin man
Francis Adams, long dead, provides a strik-
ing instance of it in his “Songs of the
Army of the Night.” A cable had reached
Sydney dated London, May 15, 1889, which
told of an audience given by the present
German ex-Emperor to coalminers on strike
in Westphalia. The audience lasted ten
minutes, and, among other pleasantries,
William explained that “if the slightest re-
sistance was shown he would shoot every
man.” Francis Adams replied in verse to
the then Emperor as follows: —
Son of a man and grandson of a man,
Mannikin most miserable in thy shrunken
shape
And peevish, shrivelled soul, is’t thou
wouldst ape
The thunder-bearer of Fate’s blustering clan?
Know, then, that never, since the years began,
The terrible truth was surer of this w T ord:
“Who takes the sword shall perish by the
sword !”
For mankind’s nod makes mannikin and
man.
To peer 29 years into the future and strike
it right was a good performance.

Harlequin, 1927.
Walking down Pitt-street I met Harlequin,
r Commanding and audacious as of old,
Though he had substituted gloves and cane
For one-time lozenges of green and gold.
Not over-much I care to stand and talk
With Harlequin in Pitt-street, since I
know
Over his shoulder most men see the face,
Sick face and haunted eyes of young
Pierrot.
Pale young Pierrot —no match for Harle-
quin,
That splendid rake who stole away Pier-
rette,
Dazzling the child with his magnificence
Of flashing brain and body suppler yet.
The fight was all unequal and unfair.
And so my voice was formal as I said :
“And is she well, Pierrette?” Tall Harlequin
Shrugged lazy shoulders, smiled, and shook
his head.
“A rotten fight," he said ; “unfair as Hell!”
I stared, surprised. Strange phrase to
come from him.
“The boy was sick and I was strong,” he
said;
Something behind his laugh was cold and
grim.
“Not a dog’s chance,” he said; “I had no
chance.
Oh yes, I stole her for a brief hour’s
space;
But she went flying, crying, back next day
To liis sick eyes and tortured, chalk-white
face.
“Women are made like that,” said Harlequin.
“Love purged of pity, proud and strong,”
said he—
“ Such love’s beyond them all; but such a
love’s
The only passion clean enough for me.”
So on down Pitt-street strolled tall Harle-
quin,
Superb and gay, in lazy, lordly guise.
Masking with monocle and smilethc pain
Of twice ten thousand devils in his eyes.
n.s.w.
GRIZEL HUNTER.
Indictment.
Mid-morn in the hills, and the golden air
Brought honey and dew r for breath ;
The foot-track laughed to the sun, and there
I saw the little black Death.
But Death had met Death in a stronger
guise,
And the slim black snake lay dead,
Broken and gashed, with his diamond eyes
Crushed out of his battered head.
I looked at the terrible, innocent thing,
The slayer savagely slain,
Till thought was mazed in its questioning
And the sun was a mist of pain.
Searching and wondering, this I know:
When the great Last Day is here
A cry in the dust from the whole world's
foe
That fires man’s hate, through fear,
Will ring from many a mountain track
To God. who plotted all ends,
Who gave, unasked for, the poison sac,
Demanding amends, amends !

ELSIE COLE.
The Garden.
Prone on the grass the statues lie,
Discolored with the wind and rain;
Broken the stile we lingered by
Where unpruned roses bloom in vain.
But still the great elm spreads its tent.
And still the speckled thrushes sing
As down the mos S-grown paths we went-
My slow heart lags.... remembering !

DORATHY FRANCES PERRY.
The Girl in the Grey Street.
She said: “When I am rich and old
I shall wear sumptous gowns of gold,
Deep apricot and daffodil,
Like sunset flaming down a hill.
“I shall wear silks as soft as mist—
Carnation color, amethyst,
Sapphire and silver, peacock blues ;
Great amber beads and satin shoes.
“And in my garden, all alight
With blossom for my heart’s delight.
I’ll joy with every dawn-flushed sky
In color —color till I die.
“And then I shall not care a jot.
So gay I’ll go, with youth forgot,
Nor wince when folk say, ‘There she goes.
Poor daft old lady all in rose.’ ”
FIJI.
A. SMITH.
The Tenancy.
I shall go as my father went,
A thousand plans in his mind—
With something in hand unspent,
When death lets fall the blind.
I shall go as my mother went.
The ink still wet on the line;
I shall pay no rust as rent
For the house that is mine.
N.S.W.
MARY GILMORE.
The Knight-Errant.
Enormous wrath had left the nations cold;
The graves were many and the tears were
few;
Men cried aloud that all the Avorld was
new,
Yet felt that it was weary, bent and old,
Leaning upon a crooked staff of gold;
And deaf to all the trumpet calls that
blew
Out of a morning fresh with dreams and
dew,
Measuring the day by what its hands might
hold.
Yet were the hard ways full of wheels and
din;
Space narrowed at the raucous shout of
speed
Anti Time’s breath shortened where the whirl
of feet
And clash of tongues made every moment
thin....
And there went forth a fool of little heed
To save the world because a song was sweet.
N.S.AV.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Haste.
To-day wo dip our thoughts in many dyes.
Staining the surface merely; at the core
No tinge is found. Oh, that we might have
more
Slow-steeping time to ponder and grow wise'
Why do we cozen greedy ears and eyes
With crude material of the senses’ ore?
Surely ’twere worthier to refine, to pour
Pure essences and subtler harmonies!
But when, as some great organ-cadence falls
Through flagging themes to quiet unison,
One stays to listen at the outer walls
Until the last far, faint vibration’s gone,
A sudden jarring note the sense appals—
And Haste, raw scatterbrain, comes shouting
on.
Victoria.

Wreckage.
“ITow many years ago, old chap;
How many years ago?”
“Six or seven or more, mayhap.'’
And he really did not know.
Six or seven ! He did not care,
Did not trouble a jot:
Hands that shook and a lifeless stare
In the eyes that had forgot.
Six or seven or maybe more!
(Leave him alone to die.)
Ours to sow for another war,
For another truth or lie!
Ours to scatter the crimson seed.
(Leave him alone to rot!)
Ours to sow on the waiting mead
With the hands that have forgot.
Leave him to die, and haste aw T ay,
Quick from his shaded bed;
Night has fallen since yesterday,
And the dawn to-day is red:
Red with the blood of men unspilt,
What of his tortured brain?
Here’s a blade with a virgin liilt
And an edge without a stain ;
Here is g man with heart of rock.
Ready to show the way;
What’s it matter of what his stock
If his heart be red to-day?
Six or seven ! He did not know
(Wreckage is well forgot) ;
Ours the seed and the will to 50w....
Leave him alone to rot!
“How many years ago, old chap;
How many years ago?”
“»S ‘i.v or seven or more, mayhap.”
And lie really did not know.

Tui.
From a lofty rimu tree
Hear the tui calling:;
Comes the flawless melody,
Silver as a moon-swept sea.
Liquid as the water falling
In a Southland gully, hid
Lawyer-vine and fern amid.
Such the minstrel’s subtle art.
Holding me in bondage;
Lo, its music seems a part
Of the forest’s secret heart.
Witchery of bloom and frondage,
Ngaio bush and supplejack,
Gems of hidden nook and track!
Is it but a foolish whim
That the wide land changes.
Swarded rise and valley dim
Into newer beauty swim?
Are the distant snow-w Tapped ranges
To a larger grandeur stirred
By the magic of a bird?
Idle fancies? Even so.
Mine in fullest measure
Is the happiness to know'
Such vain dreams in strains that now
When the tui yields its treasure,
Flinging from the rimu-tree
Largesse of its song to me.

THE WONDERFUL SLANG GOVERN-
MENT.
Throughout its career the unique Slang
Government of N. S. Wales has been wholly
disreputable—not picturesquely so after the
manner of a decayed mansion, but squalidly
and slummily disreputable, like a mean
street full of beer and bad language. In
the beginning its precarious hold on office
depended on the purchase of a constituency,
which was paid for with a well-salaried
billet on the Meat Board. The Ministerial
majority was lost again by reason of general
disgust at the time of the Loughlin-
Gillies-Goodin defection, and was repur-
chased with a promise which was never
kept. Before that there was a hunt up and
down the country for the lost nominee
whose vote was required to bring about the
abolition of the Upper House; this, though
a good enough athletic event, lacked
dignity. All through, the Cabinet was
clumsy to a degree, stupid, uncouth, men-
dacious and given to washing its dirty linen
(the only kind it seemed to possess) in the
middle of the busiest street it could find.
And at last the Premier and his henchman,
Willis of the Nominee House, started on
a home-wrecking outburst, mostly, it may
be, because their tempers were frayed
through too much soiled linen. In any case,
Lang was about due for another demonstra-
tion in his favorite character of the Strong
Man, whereas he is really only the Wrong
Man.
* * * *
When a very cross person named Seale,
who had been chairman of the A.L.P. but
was such no longer, collected a hopeless
minority of “Reds” and set them up as
the real A.L.P. Conference, he was at least
in the position of a man with nothing in
particular to lose. Willis, Vice-President
of the Executive Council, joined up, but
he is the worst-paid of the salaried Mini-
sters, and, being the least popular, no one
is likely ever to offer him even a poor salary
again. He had little to lose, either, except
his temper. Premier Lang attended in
the capacity of an untidy minor king
raising a revolt against himself. One idea
is that he is really a firebrand of the Mos-
cow pattern, and was tired of wearing the
misfit cloak of dissimulation. Another is
that he has no mental existence (in politics,
at all events) apart from his friend Willis,
and lives in a sort of hypnotic condition,
after the manner of Trilby until Svengali
died. He was the only Minister with an
Assembly seat who attached himself to the
disruption movement, and he received and
accepted very definite instructions how to
manhandle his colleagues. Some of them
were to go, and the rest were to mildly
acquiesce in their going; also certain private
members were to be ejected. In short, the
Premier was to jettison his majority, and
he professed to be willing. It isn’t on record
that he gained anything, save, perhaps, the
approval of Willis, by these remarkable
acts, but something of the same sort is
often said when the body is found, and it
is a clear case of jelo de se. One result
of these complicated happenings was that
Willis, M.L.C., became an absentee from
Cabinet meetings. For a brief hour, in
act, a report circulated that he was drowned,
either by accident, or by his own act, or
through a friend holding his head under
water. Another result was that the Premier
ceased for some time to hold Cabinet meet-
ings, and when he called the disordered body
together, and it refused to provide a friend
of his with a billet at £lB5O per annum,
a climax ensued.
* 4= * *
In the end Lang did what might have
been expected of him, he being obstinate,
perverse and ignorant. And Governor De
Chair did what might have been expected
of him, being altogether too affable an
Excellency at an emergency. The Premier
handed in the resignation of the whole
Ministry, and got a commission to form a
new one. It passes understanding why the
work was entrusted to a man with such an
obvious minority—one who was resigning
because his supporters had mostly left him
—but almost everything in the confused
narrative is difficult to understand. The
new Cabinet was promptly formed of Lang,
his friend Willis and some new men, all
“Red” and “extreme.” A place was left
open for Badly, now abroad at the public
expense, if he cared to take it. The bright,
fresh Cabinet, being able to muster only 18
votes in. a House of 90, can’t meet Parlia-
ment to get further supply or anything else,
except in the unbelievable event of the rift,
or crevasse, or gorge in the lute being
patched up. So the Premier has promised a
general election in September, when the
available funds will be exhausted, and the
promise will doubtless be kept unless some
apparently impossible circumstances open a
way for its breakage. In that case his
Excellency’s leg will be pulled again. Some
questions which remain are whether the
makeshift minority Cabinet will borrow
another £10,000,000 during the period of
respite and start a popular Public Works
policy (it has already put up the interest
rate to attract money) ; whether it will con-
trive to find many good billets for its
friends, and to deprive many people whom
it doesn’t consider its friends of the billets
they had; and whether it will do any-
thing more than usually unusual in
the way of preparation for the election.
Another question is how the fresh crowd
will pose as a. Labor Government if it is
expelled bodily from the Labor party, but
to judge from its record it will pose with-
out any difficulty. It is rather a pity that
Excellency De Chair, having entrusted the
leader of a Labor section allegedly 18 strong
with the right to form a Ministry and with
the keys of the Treasury, doesn’t send for
the other Labor section, understood to be 28
strong, and let it form a Ministry, too. and
give it duplicate keys. It isn’t customary
to have duplicate Cabinets, but this is a
time of chansre and flux.
THE OTHER BRANCH OF THE
ANGLO-SAXON RACE.
One Thompson has been elected, by popu-
lar vote, Mayor of Chicago (U.S.A.), the
second city for size in the Republic and
the fifth largest in the world. He climbed
to office on the strength of his anti-British
policy, which was fast, furious and abusive.
Though a U.S.A. Mayor is a potentate, it
is impossible for Thompson, as Mayor, to
help materially in undermining the throne
of George V.; but he doubtless believed
that the attitude would improve his chances
for the Presidency, for which he is said to
be well in the running. He is defined as
“a child of the people,” and the said people
are described at times as “the other branch
of the Anglo-Saxon race.”
* »j! * #
When Washington’s country took its
first census in 1790 it counted up 3,172,008
white inhabitants, mostly of British descent,
but including the Dutch population of New
York, originally a colony of Holland. There
were also 757,208 people of African blood,
and a dubious lot of Indians. A liberal
assortment of Frenchmen, Spaniards, In-
dians and negroes were added by annexa-
tion, but very few people of British pedi-
gree came in that way. Fairly reliable
records of immigration begin in 1820, and
between that date and 1870 these are given
as the arrivals in the States from various
lands:—
England, Wales and Scotland .. .. 613,250
Great Britain (not otherwise specified,
but doubtless largely people who went
to England in search .of passages) .. 544,107
Ireland .. .. .. .: 2,700,493
Germany .. .. .. ■. 2,368,483
Other .. .. .. .. .. 1,327,532
It is loosely recorded that immigration into
the U.S. was almost nil between the begin-
ning of the republic and 1815. During these
years of European strife only about 3500
people per annum wandered across the
Atlantic. Between 1815 and 1820 the arrivals
were mostly Germans, escaping from fam-
ine, for it was a bad time, from compulsory
service, and from the tyranny of restored
princes, who had been objectionable before
and came back soured by temporary eclipse.
The republic thus began to lose its Anglo-
Saxon complexion very early. The strangers
died off, but they left children who ranked
among the native-born. Theoretically these
were to be “absorbed.” but there weren’t
nearly enough absorbers. And as the
strangers died off new ones arrived to fill
up. By 1910 most of the 1820-70 influx
had gone to their permanent residence. In
that year the U.S. contained 91,972,266 in-
habitants. Of these 9,827,763 were negro,
13.345,546 imported, and the rest mostly
offspring of non-British ancestors. The
foreign-born came from various countries:—
England, Wales and Scotland .. . . 1,219,968
Canada (the Dominion people are much
less than half of British descent them-
selves) .. . . . . . . . . 1,196,070
Germany .. .. . . . . .. 2,501,181
Russia 1,732,421
Austria and Hungary .. .. . . 1,670,524
Ireland 1,352,155
Italy 1,343,070
Mixed Non-Britons .. .. . . . . 2,330,156
The census of 1910 was the high-water
mark of the foreign-born population. Re-
strictions began then to be applied, and
the 1920 census alleged that Uncle had only
13,712,754 strangers within his gates,
1,134,551 being British, and 12,578,203 other-
wise. Germany made the biggest display,
as usual. In the six years 1920-25 inclusive
3,068,914 immigrants found admission into
the States. Only 331,181 of these were
classed as from “the British Isles,” and they
were largely Celts from Ireland.
* ■ * # *
It is not a very good showing for “the
other branch of the Anglo-Saxon race,” and
for “Hands Across the Sea” and other familiar
ideas. English is certainly the official lan-
guage of the United States, because it got
there first; but it is not by any means
always used to promote friendship with
England. The anti-British sentiment among
the Irish population of the republic has
always been recognised. The anti-British
feeling among German-Americans was cul-
tivated for a long time before the war, and
during the war it was cultivated with in-
tense energy. Most likely it has come
to stay. The German is curiously amen-
able to discipline. The Austro-Hungarian
class has doubtless no love for the British
nation, which helped them so whole-
heartedly to lose the war. And if the Rus-
sian section is influenced by the Bolshevik
propaganda of its mother country, it will
be pronouncedly Anglophobe also. The
case is not so much one of the lack of
American friendship as that it is hard to
find the American of popular conception
—the idealised Uncle—to be friendly with.
So far the Presidency remains very con-
sistently with men whose names imply
British descent, Van Buren and Roosevelt
being respectable exceptions. But the mass
of subjects is very mixed, and possibly
Thompson of Chicago, being a man of
political foresight, recognises that the mix-
ture is going to become worse and more
anti-British, and is taking advantage of the
rising but muddy tide.
SUPERFLUOUS IMPORTS.
In the very informative “Overseas Trade
Bulletin” prepared by the Commonwealth’s
able statisticians, of whom C. H. Wickens
is chief, it is recorded that foodstuffs of the
value of £9,561,952 were imported in 1925-26.
It is a melancholy item, because most of
the foodstuffs mentioned are, and nearly all
the rest could be, produced in Australia.
Moreover, partly because of the unnecessary
imports in this division, Australia’s pur-
chases of goods exceeded its sales by
£6,143,104 last year, although it had to find
interest on a public debt of £1,000,000.000,
owed mainly to foreigners. Hence an embar-
rassing financial position abroad, as well as
less work and wealth at home.
* * * *
The leading item on the list is tea. In
the last two years imports amounted to
96,344,2001 b., valued at £7,512,400. Not 35
years ago it was generally supposed that
only Greece could grow currants. A simi-
lar bluff gave China a practical monopoly
of tea-growing for centuries. There is pro-
bably no better reason why we shouldn’t
grow tea than currants. Half our supplies
nowadays come from the Dutch East Indies,
only two or three days’ journey by steamer
from North Westralia, in parts of which
soil and climate are precisely what the tea
plant requires. And then there is rice.
Here, it is true, progress is being made,
though it is too recent to be reflected in
the “Overseas Trade Bulletin.” Two thou-
sand tons of excellent quality, for which
£lO 10s. per ton was paid by the Australian
millers, have been harvested in the Murrum-
bidgee irrigation area, yields ranging from
50 bushels to more than 100 bushels per
acre. It is estimated that the watered part
of the area, which is only one-third devel-
oped for irrigation, contains 53,000 acres
suitable for this vegetable. If that acreage
is not sufficient, the Goulburn Valley can be
drawn upon— Elwood Mead recommended it
in this connection. The managing director
of Robert Harper and Co., Ltd., which mills
rice in four States and manufactures starch,
has informed the Tariff Board that, from
what he has seen at Leeton and Griffith,
“there is no reason why Australia should not
be self-contained, as far as rice is concerned,
inside two or three years, and it may
become an exporter.” Yet until an officer
of the Irrigation Commission went to Cali-
fornia and saw rice being grown on land
resembling the heavy soils of the Murrum-
bidgee, and was told that California was
exporting considerable quantities to Asia,
the prospects of producing rice in Australia
seemed as remote as the prospects of pro-
ducing tea and tobacco do now. As
regards tobacco, which isn’t classified as a
foodstuff, 22,040,0001 b. unmanufactured,
valued at £2,250,000, was imported last year,
21,546,7001 b. of it, valued at £2,177,700,
coming from the U.S.A.
* * * *
Progress is also being made in lines such
as malted milk. There was a great stir
among the Foreign-traders when it was
proposed to protect the manufacture of
malted milk. The British and American
brands, it was said, had such a name that
no Australian article could compete with
them. Duties of Bd. and 6d. per lb. were
clapped on, nevertheless; and last year im-
ports dropped from 173,5751 b., valued at
£26,696, to 108.4131 b., valued at £14.302.
Before long malted milk will have disap-
peared from the list of imports, as con-
densed milk has disappeared. Imports of
breakfast foods are also declining, though
not as fast as they should, considering the
many excellent preparations put up in
Australia. But £177,000 was sent abroad
last year for “fruits and vegetables preserved
in liquid, etc.,” although this country grows
more fruit and vegetables, canning varieties
as well as others, than it knows what to
do with. To the U.S.A. alone went £119,370
for “fruits, etc., preserved,” and £47,455 for
“other vegetable foodstuffs,” chief of which,
no doubt, was a line of baked beans
no better than a corresponding Aus-
tralian article, if it is as good. In all these
cases, and many others, the silly prejudice
against Australian goods fingers.
In addition to the £3,639,600 worth of
tea that came in last year, and the £2,250.300
worth of raw tobacco, we paid £1.164,200
for tinned fish, £311,700 for sausage casings,
£94,200 for potted meat, £198,300 for coffee,
£114,650 for confectionery, £323,400 for
maize, £30.200 for hops, £49,900 for oats.
£509,600 for linseed. £88,300 for pickles and
sauces, £26,400 for biscuits and £33,700 for
bacon and ham. It is folly to be sending
so much money abroad for .things which we
are capable of supplying ourselves—criminal
folly.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Politicians’ Pets.
The immediate cause of the Ministerial
reconstruction and party split in N. *'>_
Wales was a wrangle over an exercise ot
patronage. At the first Cabinet meeting
held for five weeks, Premier Lang said it
was his wish that T. Treble, sometime his
private secretary, should be appointed Child
Endowment Commissioner at £IBSO p.a.
Willis was willin’, but the so-called “mod-
erate” Ministers objected. Not on the salu-
tary ground that all such appointment;
should be made through the Public Service
Board, so that the claims of all aspirant;
might be fairly examined and judged, but
because they considered £IBSO p.a. exces-
sive. While willing to give Treble the
job, and therefore to continue the policy
of reserving public-service plums for poli-
ticians’ pets, they reckoned £IOOO p.a. enoug i
for a young gentleman who drew £9 10s. a
week as Premier’s secretary and was raise
to £ls 10s. a week when he became “assist-
ant administrator” to the Treason. 0
shove him up to £35 10s. a week migi ,
they contended, have ruinous results in
constituencies where the civil-service 'O'
is strong. What the Premier said m reph
to these “arguments” is not recorded,
what he did has become a part of fc . •

meats and promotions are supposed to


the hands of impartial men who pay due
regard to ability and experience, pushing
youngsters who have shown some aptitude
for dusting a Minister’s desk and typing
his letters and shooing away inconvenient
callers have repeatedly been rewarded with
fat billets, to the detriment of officers with
far greater capacity and length of service.
In some cases sinecures have been created
for the favored youths, with the result that
the taxpayers have had to carry the burden
of superfluous departments, for the sineeurist
always takes care to surround himself
with a staff.
The system is seen at its worst in N. S.
Wales, but it is by no means confined to
the Ma State. A very bad example has
come to light in the Commonwealth service.
A gentleman who had been secretary to
two or three Prime Ministers was sent to
London as secretary in the High Com-
missioner’s office at £2OOO p.a. He is ex-
changing posts with the secretary of the
Defence Department in Melbourne, but will
still draw his £2OOO p.a., . although the
present incumbent, who has had 17 years’
experience of Defence administration, over
nine years as secretary, gets £1350 p.a. only.
When the gentleman went abroad it was
supposed that £650 of his £2OOO p.a. was to
be a special London allowance, but it now
appears that there was an arrangement that
his salary should be “not less than £2OOO
p.a.,” wherever he happened to be, before
he left the Commonwealth. The arrange-
ment was apparently one of Hughes’s gifts
to the nation for which he has done so
much; Bruce pleads that he is blameless;
and Parliament was not consulted. One
result is that an under-secretary in the
second class will get the same salary as. the
Solicitor-General; £SOO a year more than
the Crown Solicitor, the Chief of the General
Staff C.M.F., the Auditor-General and the
Director-General of Health; £BOO p.a. more
than the Chief Engineer in the Works and
Railways; £9OO p.a. more than the Chief
Electrical Engineer in the Postmaster-
General’s Department; and £IOOO p.a. more
than the Chief Electoral Officer and the
Commonwealth Meteorologist. That in its
turn will result in these officers and many
others asking for increases which it will be
exceedingly difficult for the Government to
refuse.
♦
Can We Make It Honest?
Not enough sympathy is shown to Labor
politicians, who have to define whereabouts
they live in the political spectrum. Mem-
bers of other parties can camp comfortably
on the blue, the orange or the green, with
no need to stir for years and years and
years; but your Laborite who wants to
keep his job must make little butterfly
dashes from end to end of a long- stretch
that shades from blush rose pink into
geranium scarlet. At the deep-dyed end
can be descried, through writhing flames
that devour fat capitalists, banks, churches
and police stations, visions of masked men
handling bombs and pistols. At the pale
end is an array of little packages filled with
more or less innocuous schemes for giving
back to the working man some of the
money he pays in taxes. At election and
other times when it is necessary to talk
to crowds largely composed of day laborers,
it is simply impossible for the Labor can-
didate to keep away from the sanguinary
view of things. To refrain, or to con-
tent himself with a Laodicean dabbling
of fingers in the warmer tints, is to
be acclaimed a traitor, a pimp, a crawler,
a scab, a Nationalist, or a supporter of the
Employers’ Federation—and the last two
epithets are almost invariably fatal. But
in the haven of Parliament most Labor
members scramble to the end where the
mild little packages are, and open one or
two, and try to forget the warring world.
And then along comes a conference, and the
more bogus it is the more determined it will
be to extract from every member a confes-
sion of faith. No raving revivalist was ever
half so persistent in demanding whether the
saved brother was keeping saved. Then the
startled Labor butterfly makes a quick flight
to the Red end—only perhaps to find that
Red isn’t the moment’s proper wear.
Now what is the Labor M.P. going to
do about it? He might, for a start, think
whether it wouldn’t, after all, be a good
thing for the party to be honest. At
present it isn’t, or anything like it. The
party drafts a programme of about 60 items,
and expects every Laborite to support the
lot. The rank and file doesn’t pretend to
know in full what the party is pledged to;
so it just lets things slide. It doesn’t use
its vote; it hands it over to somebody else
to use. Besides being unpatriotic this is
just plain dishonest. The first step, then,
would seem to be to reduce the party plat-
form to about three planks. A man could
stand on them and know where he was.

Are Our Lighthouses a Failure?
The Riverina stranded at Gabo in blind-
ing rain, near one of the most powerful
lighthouses on the Australian coast. The
Cooma was in sight of a lighthouse when
she stranded. The Tasman and Hopewell
stranded on an island on which there was
supposed to be a light, though it was found
to be extinguished. The eastern coast of
Australia is notoriously tricky, and the fre-
quency with which vessels anchor or lay-to
when visibility is bad, and they are not sure
of their position, suggests that a radical
change in our navigation-warning system is
required.
Europe and America have already moved
in this respect, and radio direction-finders
are replacing lighthouses. Experiments
with radio-compass apparatus in the British
Mercantile Marine showed that at ranges
up to 70 miles the bearings were accurate
to within one degree. With the coastal
direction-finders the apparatus is much more
exact because of the co-operation of two
stations which check each other’s bearings.
The United States Government has already-
erected 11 automatic radio lighthouses, and
47 others are in course of construction.
Britain has three stations erected and seven
in course of construction. The advantage
over the light-beam is that the navigation
officer of a vessel who is not sure of him-
self can immediately find his true position,
irrespective of the state of the weather.
Grudges and Grouches.
Though Maoriland’s most rubicund and
adroit Minister attended the Canberra open-
ing and said honeyed words about his
Dominion’s great love for Australia, as a
matter of fact it has two or three well-
defined grudges against Big Brother. One
is over the Great War. Australia raised a
big army and played a big part in the scrap,
but it didn’t compel anybody to go and
fight. The Shivery Islands at the end were
calling up sedate citizens of 45 with sizable
families. Yet nowadays the great world,
which deals with results rather than with
intentions, only remembers the Maori-
landers’ part in the war because they put
the N.Z. in Anzac, and every reference to
the part played by “colonial” troops is
laudatory of Australians without any men-
tion of the men from the other side of the
Tasman.
Then there is trade. There isn’t really
anything in the trading relations of the
two countries to get hot about, and a reci-
procal tariff agreement, made years ago, is
satisfactory to both parties in most respects.
The exceptions are wheat, coal and timber.
In war time, and even since, the Govern-
ment sent out patriotic appeals to farmers
to grow wheat—though most of them can
do far better growing other things—and
then, since the Farmers’ Union is the Gov-
ernment’s grandmother, has had to guaran-
tee to buy all the wheat that is produced
and pay a price that will satisfy the grower
—and he is not an easy man to satisfy. This
gets the Government into trouble outside
farming circles, because Australian wheat,
or its flour equivalent, can generally be im-
ported at a lower price than the Government
guarantee. The Government is between two
fires. It must either fix the price of wheat
and buy all that merchants refuse to take
at the price, or be called upon by cockies
to put a stiff duty on the necessary Aus-
tralian contribution to the staff of life.
Whatever way it takes out of the trouble,
Australia is regarded as the enemy of farm
folk—something to be put down.
As to coal, Maoriland imports each year
from Newcastle about £500,000 worth, a
good deal of which is used on the rail-
ways. Of course the coal for the railways
ought to come out of the State mines, but
as soon as a man gets a job in a State
mine he seems to devote the rest of his
life to proving that no man ought to be
asked to be a miner. As locomotives of
the type used in Fernland live on coal they
have to get it from- somewhere, and the
easiest way out of his difficulties, for a
worried chief engineer, is to send an order
to N. S. Wales, where they strike sometimes
but don’t make it their steady business in
life.
In the matter of timber, trade is about
even, taking year in and year out, and a
tariff war would hit both parties with
about an equal wallop.
If a representative from either side were
commissioned to go and fight the whole
business out to a finish with a single eye
to the interests of both parties, the cham-
pions would probably find, at the end of
their tussle, that it was a wonder anybody
was able to discover anything to quarrel
about. Bruce might do worse than send
someone over on a conciliatory mission.
The only really serious thing about the
whole business is that Australians don’t
realise how serious it is to antagonise a
small lusty brother who otherwise might
be enlisted as a good friend and a good
partner.
When Should a Child Start School?
Dear Bulletin, —The educational experi-
ment carried out by “Crcesus” in teaching
his eight-year-old son for 12 months (B.
19/5/’27) has yielded me further support
for the contention I made long ago in The
Bulletin —that children should not start
school until eight years of age. All the
same, there are some children, apart from
those who spend so many happy hours
playing in the kindergartens, who, though
less than eight years old, can and do profit
by the present school education. My
daughter has been less than two and a
half years enrolled, and already she has
completed five months of the fourth grade
(nine-year-old average class), and she won’t
be eight until the end of June. By the
Terman revision of the Binet-Simon mental
tests, she is in the superior-intelligence
division. Thus more depends on mental
than actual age.
But I must disagree with one statement
made by “Crcesus” —that “up to the age
of 12 the necessary mind training, brain
development and manual training could
better be carried out by a sensible parent
in the ordinary home life.” Not many
can do as he has done. Few parents are
so well-equipped as he evidently is; fewer
can spare the time. And you must get in
some “book-learning” before 12. If you
don’t (to cite but one instance), the child
will miss the supreme joy of reading for
himself the great fairy tales and folk lore
which he won’t want to understand when
he reaches the hero-worship stage at 12.
Moreover, a child begins to be useful soon
after eight, and without compulsory school-
ing some parents would then make the
children work if they didn’t have to learn.
How old were the children who worked in
the coalmines and cotton-mills of Britain
100 years ago?
There is more than one matter to con-
sider in the problem of education, and
“Crcesus” has overstated his case by stress-
ing only one of them. Yours, — Country Ped.

The Incredible City.
Ever since the Federal capital was officially
“opened” there has been a sort of running
inquiry as to what there really is in and
ahead of the town. A great deal of what
may be called prophetic information has
been supplied by politicians who have
mainly dealt with “glorious possibilities”;
and very doubtful present-day data has
been accepted by newspapers from the press-
publicity department of the Federal Capital
Commission. The value of the information
supplied can be estimated by one Sydney
paper’s praise of the Commission’s good
work in hurriedly furnishing and staffing
the still unfinished Brassey House so that
it was ready for the guests who arrived
for the big event. Brassey House was
certainly furnished and staffed in a hurry,
but it did not hold a single guest; and that
is quite a characteristic example of the
Commission’s capacity for making a great
fuss about a futility. The simple truth is
there has been far too much “faking” of
the situation at Canberra.
In some respects the place starts off with
unique advantages. Water supply, sewerage
and electric light and power, usually luxu-
ries which only come when a city has
grown, are there waiting. If a city really
does grow to connect up all the spaces that
have been set aside for this, that and the
other, it will no doubt be a very well-
planned and comfortable city; but mean-
time the distances that scatter everything
from everything else are merely incon-
venient and expensive, and they are liable
to remain that way if the city only half
grows. And it will take something more
than civil servants to make a city. At
Ainslie, however, the plans declare, an in-
dustrial district is to arise. “Several in-
dustries,” an official document gushes, “have
already been opened in this district—a
laundry, two motor garages and a printing
office!” Which is another example of the
Commission’s habit of making mountains
of achievement out of its molehills.
Nor are the small enterprises which are
there generally enthusiastic. “I dare not do
anything to offend the Commission,” was
the way one man put it. Regimental
methods are too much in evidence, and the
poor civic spirit which is bound to exist
under a despotism on military lines will
not be improved by the snobocracy which
has already developed.
The idea of those who viewed Canberra
uninfluenced by the politicians’ guff, or the
officials’ duty-bound inclination to paint
rosy pictures, was that it is likely to become
a socially disagreeable place, growing dingy
in a half-growth of its planners’ ideas and
an effort to live entirely on politics and
politicians’ washing—there is nothing in the
place to suggest that any real industry will
grow there. Something might be done, how-
ever, to make it less a failure than it
threatens to be otherwise. And part of
the something might be to give the inhabit-
ants their civic independence as early as
possible.

The Centenary of the Match.
On April 7 of this year the humble pro-
duct of Bryant and May celebrated its
hundredth birthday; on April 7, 1827, John
Walker, pharmacist at Stockton-on-Tees,
England, made the first entry of the sale
of friction matches in his day-book. Yet the
name of this John Walker goes unhonored
save for the inscription on a brass-plate
at No. 59 High-street, Stockton-on-Tees,
the place where the original friction match
was made and sold.
Walker was a man of many parts. For
30 years he practised as a pharmacist in his
native town of Stockton-on-Tees, and prior
to this he had qualified as a surgeon; but
owing to his “invincible horror of surgical
operations,” he had abandoned that pro-
fession. A man who never married} he is
described as “trim, dapper and little,
of cheery disposition and ready wit.” He
died in 1857 and was buried in the neigh-
boring parish of Norton-on-Tees.
The actual date of the manufacture of
the first match is not clearly known; the
first credit sale only was recorded on April
7, 1827. Popular tradition in the town
held that the discovery was an accident—
that when Walker was preparing a light-
ing mixture for his own use, a match fell
into the stuff, was thrown on the hearth
and there ignited by accidental friction,
and the hint was not lost. Perusal of
Walker’s day-book, however, indicates
that the invention was the outcome of
experiment. In 1805 Chancel invented
“oxygenated matches.” which consisted of
splints of wood tipped with a mixture of
sugar and potassium chlorate, and ignited
by dipping in strong sulphuric acid; two
entries in the day-book, July, 26, 1827, and
Sept. 12, 1828, show that Walker had sold
such “oxygenated matches” to a Mrs. Faber.
Other entries, some as early as 1825, show
that a percussion powder consisting of equal
parts of antimony sulphide and potassium
chlorate had been sold; the comments on
the sales (such as “N. 8.: Excellent”) seem
to indicate that Walker was experimenting
with the proportions of the constituents of
his powder, sales of which, incidentally,
occurred only during the shooting season.
It seems reasonable to suppose, then, that,
having succeeded in producing a percussion
powder that gave good results, it occurred
to Walker to substitute this composition for
the sugar and potassium chlorate of the
dipping match, and to employ friction as
the igniting agent, and not sulphuric acid.
The matches were thin splints of wood
about three inches long, tipped with equal
parts of antimony sulphide and potassium
chlorate; they were ignited by pinching the
head between the folds of the piece of
glass paper provided with each 100 matches,
the total cost of which was Is. or Is. 2d.,
sold in a cylindrical tin box. By 1829 their
fame had spread to London. Naturally
enough, imitations soon appeared, but
Walker did not trouble to assert his rights
and steadfastly refused to patent his in-
vention. After 1829 he appears to have
ceased to manufacture the matches.
Except that in 1913 Punch published
verses in his honor, nothing has been done
in Britain to commemorate John Walker’s
invention; whether the opportunity afforded
by the centenary was seized will only be
learnt when the next mail brings scientific
journals from the United Kingdom. The
cables have been silent —on such a subject
they, of course, would be.

Malaria.
So far Sydney has escaped the curse of
malaria, largely by a mixture of good
luck and the fact that the proportion of
infected persons in its midst has been small.
But as the city’s population grows, and
the development of trade with New Guinea
and other parts of the Pacific brings it
into closer touch with the malaria-ridden
places which are right at its back door, the
danger will steadily increase.
The topographical situation of the city,
with its countless natural breeding-places
for the mosquito, is such that the extermi-
nation of the disease would be either a
heroic task, costing millions and demanding
the concerted efforts of the whole popula-
tion for years, or else it would be impossible;
and the best that could be done would be
to carry on a never-ceasing battle in order
to keep the curse within whatever limits
were possible. The present is the time when
every authority, central and local, should
join in a campaign of mosquito-extermina-
tion, aided by publicity designed to educate
the citizens to a realisation of the peril
which, although invisible, is none the less
real. It is not overstating the matter in
the slightest to say that endemic malaria
in Sydney would do infinitely more damage
than a hostile army which could be got rid
of some time, while the disease generally
comes to stay. The fact that the plague
is one which creeps silently on to its objec-
tive without advertising its presence until
it has well dug in is all the more reason
why no time should be lost in preparing to
attack it.
Victoria’s Anzac Memorial is back where
it started. The suggestion that two small
hotels at the top of Bourke-street should
be resumed and a square formed to house
the shrine was modest and reasonable, but
it was immediately seized on by every
town-planning enthusiast and publicity
hound and expanded into a proposal to buy
half upper Bourke and Collins streets and
create an immense civic centre only second
to the Champs d’Elysee. The Fink news-
papers took up the cause and implied that
if the big resumption scheme fell through,
it would mean that Germany had won
the war. A finance committee of the City
Council then sat on the scheme and dis-
covered that it would cost anything up to
one and a quarter million sterling and
the interest and sinking fund would involve
an annual rate of 4d. in the £. Whereupon
public attention wandered elsewhere and
the original idea of putting a Shrine of
Remembrance in the Domain stands until
further orders.
“Sol Malaprop”: A United States Supreme
Court has decided, in a bright moment,
that the State of Virginia was within its
rights in providing for the sterilisation of
the feeble-minded so that they may not
pass on their drawbacks to a numerous
posterity. The case was of the usual sort.
A semi-idiotic woman had a semi-idiotic
daughter or possibly a semi-idiotic family.
The daughter started young with an ille-
gitimate semi-idiotic child, and as there
were obviously large possibilities ahead an
order was issued that she should be the
first subject of the new statute. Modern
surgery has made the operation a painless
one, and the bringing forth of feeble-minded
children isn’t painless; still, some useless
philanthropist set the law in motion that
the multiplication of degenerates might
proceed at compound-interest rates, and
the burdens that the community has to
carry might increase indefinitely. The Court
bowled him out, and it is to be hoped that
its decision may hold good, and that the
practice which it upheld may spread exceed-
ingly-

POLITICAL
POINTS.
With a single-minded desire to preserve
solidarity Lang first of all quarrelled with
the Communist element in his party. Dis-
covering that this was a sure and certain
means of provoking the hostility of some
of the union engineers who were nearest to
his throne, he essayed to dissimulate and to
be conciliatory, a role for which Nature had
not fitted him. After a brief trial he found
he could not be a successful chameleon, so
lie decided to be a mule. Unfortunately —-
for himself and his party—by the time he
had come to this conclusion the Willis-Gar-
den-Voigt combination had him where they
wanted him, and the Sydney Trades Hall
looked to him as big as tiie pyramid of
Cheops.
Having expelled N.S.W. Premier Lang in
a sentence of 127 words, the Majority Labor
party (which Lang claims is in a minority
among the unions and A.L.P. branches) has
made Tom Mutch, M.L.A. for Botany and
sometime Minister of Education, its leader.
In the latter days of the Fuller Government,
which missed so many opportunities, Lang
beat Mutch for the Labor leadership by a
single vote. How different the subsequent
history of the party would have been had
that odd vote gone the other way !
Sydney’s Municipal Labor party got con-
trol of the City Council in 1924, with results
which have given the ratepayers severe pains,
because of vote-splitting on the other side.
It is now iu danger of being itself bumped
out for the same reason, inasmuch as the
Labor aldermen are being called upon to
choose between the Seales and the Conroys,
and unless the family quarrel is settled both
A.L.P. executives will run candidates, as
they did in Warringah. So the worried
aldermen may implore the reconstructed
Government to stay in office long enough
to introduce preferential voting, and make
it obligatory.
Copious tears are being shed by degenerate
Britons over J. Bull’s dismissal, at the toe
of the boot, of the Russian Embassy and
so-called Trade Delegation, which busied
itself mostly with espionage and sedition.
The fact is that Britain has placed itself
in the same position as the U.S.A., which
has steadfastly refused to recognise the rob-
ber Government that repudiated American
loans and confiscated the property of Ameri-
can citizens. And although the trade of
the country which has “socialised” every-
thing is hardly worth talking about,
America’s share for the last six years has
been at least equal to Britain’s, while it
has escaped all the political and economic
trouble which the 1021 agreement brought
on Bull.
Even if trade relations with Russia are all
burst up Australia won't be much of a loser.
The last “Official Year Book” states the case:
“Total imports of Russian origin, £35,418.
Total exports to Russia, £B.”
Victoria’s new Labor Government declares
that it will begin early to carry out the
recommendations of the Outer Ports Com-
mission, possibly with some of engineer
Buchanan’s ideas added. This was a matter
on which the Allancock Ministry slept away
its political existence for no visible reason
save that it was itself. The idea is that any
harbor with signs of a future shall be joined
PAINFUL DILEMMA OF A REALLY GOOD UNIONIST.
“The Theatrical Employees’ Association has been requesting unionists not to attend football grounds
where non-union labor is employed.”
BEELZEBUB: "What's wrong with him, Pete — won't he come in?”
ST. PETER: “No, he’s just learned that there are non-unionists singing in the heavenly
choir."
up with its natural hinterland if not joined
already, that it shall be put under a locally
elected harbor trust, and that the trust shall
have the harbor revenues to spend, and also
certain rating powers over the area benefited.
Then the place is to work out its own des-
tiny, provided the old sinful manipulation of
railway rates and other trickeries don’t get
to work again and prevent there being a
destiny. If the Hogan Government does its
job well the doors of the Temple of Fame
will yawn in front of it.
T. T. Thompson, the “Independent Pro-
testant Labor” member for Port Adelaide,
has been unseated on the curious ground that
he had circulated a cartoon depicting Frank
Condon, the Labor man he beat, as a holder
of several jobs contrary to the Labor plat-
form. The Court of Disputed Returns ruled
that the cartoon had duly influenced the
electors, who gave Thompson a majority of
IST votes, and awarded Condon costs of the
appeal. Another election will, of course, be
held ; and a wild sectarian affair it threatens
to be.
Ex-Minister Hume Cook made some pass-
ing remarks the other day to the Victorian
Constitutional Club —the kind of remarks
which should be noted by the Freetrade ass
who brays in the S. M. Herald about our
“prohibitive tariff” and similar myths:—
Australia is not settling her debts either in gold
or in goods but by borrowing more money.... As
to our trade with America, we are buying tremend-
ously in excess of what Americans buy from us. In
the past three years we spent £81,000,000 more
with America than she with us, an adverse balance
of £27,000,000 a year. Actually we have been
going into America’s debt at the rate of £3OOO an
hour during these three years, chiefly for motor-
cars, pianolas, gramophones and other luxuries. As
we cannot pay in cash or goods, America is lending
us the money to pay herself with, and making a
further profit out of us in interest.
It is the custom to allude to this sort of
thing as “the high Australian standard of
living.”
Another example of how the Navigation
Act has been turned to idiotic uses cropped
up when a member of the Speck’s Canberra
contingent of troops fell seriously ill in Mel-
bourne on the return journey. The lad’s
mother found that the only immediate means
of getting to him was a Blue Funnel liner.
She was told she could obtain a permit to
travel thereby if it could be shown that the
overseas craft was larger and faster than
the regular steamer. It happened to be
larger but a knot slower. So red tape
waggled its ears, put down its hoof, and the
anxious mother waited.
Greatly to the relief of the McCormack
Government, the Overseas Committee of the
Imperial Migration Commission has ap-
proved of the Dawson Valley irrigation
scheme, which its representatives lately
inspected. The Government has backed the
ambitious experiment with all the money
it could borrow, and needs more. Shortage
of funds has hampered progress on the big'
dam at Nathan’s Gorge, which is designed
to impound the water from a catchment area
of 9000 square miles, and irrigate 200,000
acres of agricultural land. That phase may
be over now.
Week-end reports from China are fairly
copious but mixed. The Northern or Repub-
lican army has gained a lot of ground, which
will be eminently satisfactory if it isn't lost
again. The Southern or Communist or ex-
Communist army has lost a lot of ground,
and that is very good if it isn’t gained again.
The Red forces were lately said to have split
into a faction which objected to being bossed
by intrusive Russians and one which didn’t
object, but they may have come together
again. There has been a cessation of news
about Bolshevik meddling and truculence in
the Canton region, and it is understood that
the Conroy half of the Southern host killed
a lot of them while the Seale half tried
vainly to stem the rush. Each half disputes
the validity of the other’s credentials, and
says its conference is bogus. Tidings of
the implacable anti-British sentiment which
was said to grow like a young spring bamboo
in the mind of every true Chow have ceased
to arrive for some time. The sentiment
almost appears to be developing into affection.
Canberra consists mostly of the Sabbath
Day’s journey between one lone building and
another, but the bill for what is visible is
reckoned at £7,000,000 and millions more out-
lay is in sight. It is a modest and shrink-
ing invoice, and unless somebody breaks into
the dark secret with a crowbar the cost may
never be fully revealed.
An unexpected witness who turned up
before the Tariff Board to tell it about the
blessings of Freetrade and to object to the
encouragement of the Australian hosiery
industry was Benham, lecturer on economics
at Sydney University. It is wonderfully
hard to make such pundits under-
stand that this country is under an obliga-
tion to export over 30 millions’ worth per
annum and absolutely avoid receiving any
imports in return, that being the amount of
the tribute which the foreign-loan policy has
put it under. When a nation borrows
£42,000,000 abroad to meet current expenses,
as was the case in 1921-22, quotations from a
long-defunct Adam Smith whose bones are
at the far side of the globe are of no avail.
Maoriland isn’t quite sure whether its
Dairy Pi-oduce Control Board should be
chopped up and burned or merely planed and
smoothed, but it is much dissatisfied. The
board was endowed with unlimited powers
to boss dairy exports, to eliminate the middle-
man, and to be a blessing generally. It num-
bered a dozen members in Maoriland, with a
London agency of indefinite size, and it
charged a quarter-fartlnng per lb. on butter
and one-eightli of a farthing on cheese for
expenses. Then it notified the British middle-
men that if they sold Maoriland butter and
cheese below the price fixed weekly their
supplies would be stopped, and if they sold
above it they must pay the ill-gotten gains
to the board. Many dealers gave up selling
Maoriland butter and cheese, and the unsold
accumulation looked like an Alp, and when
it was ultimately cleared off at bargain prices
the sacrifice for one year was guessed at
between two and 2i millions.
The German has spent seven years investi-
gating his own conduct during the Great War.
and has presented himself with his own
report signed by himself with his own mailed
fist. The general tenor is that the other
people began the business; that London was
bombed only on Sundays or at night when
nobody was there; that Paris was bom-
barded because the French attacked defence-
less German towns first; that the British
blockade of German ports was illegal, and
unrestricted submarine warfare was thereby
fully justified ; and that France led the way
in the use of poison gas. It is added that
the Belgians broke the Hague Convention
in various places and pieces, and that the
vicious smashing of French and Belgian
private property while Fritz was retreating
from a lost war was a matter of military
necessity. Some remarks about the unbridled
ambition of Montenegro and Portugal will
appear in a supplement.
Certain manufacturers the other day had a
confabulation with Prime Minister Bruce con-
cerning the tariff and the Commonwmaltn
Arbitration Court. The tale was that the
Court was always being applied to for more
pay, or less work, or both, and that by
majority vote it had laid down the rule that
it had no concern with the question whether
the industry could pay any more. The course
open to the manufacturer, he was told, was
to get more tariff protection, and use it as a
means to put up prices. Prices being up. the
regular course was another application to the
wage-fixing Court, followed by another to the
Tariff Board and so on. Meanwhile Free-
traders were busy denouncing local industry
for wanting Protection, and importers were
busy bringing in foreign goods, and Govern-
ments were busy floating foreign loans to
help pay for them. The Prime Minister
wasn’t helpful, and nothing seems likely to
meet such an extraordinary case except put-
ting a lot of luxuries on the list of pro-
hibited imports.

“Troy”: The “aided” school was an insti-

who will not readily forget it. I knew a
girl who went to an island in the Hauraki
Gulf under this system, and as the family
paid half her meagre salary she found she was
expected to supplement the work of teaching
four young demons by cooking, sewing, mend-
ing, washing dishes, milking, hoeing vegetables
and feeding pigs and poultry. A steamer had
arrived unexpectedly one morning—the first
for three months —to ship a cargo of sheep.
While the school-teacher was imparting the
mysteries of addition to her pupils the boss
dashed in, ordered the children each to a
different mustering-post, and the teacher to a
high hill behind the house. Half-way up the
Bill she jibbed and came down, rushed into
the empty house and secured her belongings,
and ere the first sheep had crossed the
gangway she was firmly established in the
cabin, bound for Auckland. With the rapid
spread of settlement the aided school has
mercifully become rare.

mate. The amount of alcohol borne on the
blast is indicated by the changing color of
the solution. This registers yellow for one
or two nips, and so on through all the hues
of the spectrum to green—the absolute limit.
It is not stated whether there is any con-
nection between this final phase and the
green rats and similar phenomena of d.t’s.

“Queensland Nut”: Of all the States
Queensland seems best worth the atten-
tion of the collector. A very
early and valuable copy of
Dante’s “Inferno” was once
found here and identified by
the late Samuel Griffith.
Only lately a Brisbane man
discovered himself to be the
owner of a lost Giotto
“Madonna,” and a holidaying
squatter quite casually bought
an urn which has turned out
to be a piece of French
china of great rarity and
beauty. Finally, an Ipswich
man bought for a few shil-
lings a bronze bowl which
English experts declare to be
sixteenth-century w T ork by
Watteau. It represents Can-
ute challenging the waves,
and is worth a few thou-
sands.

“F. J.E.”: Even a motor-
driver may be unjustly ac-
cused of insobriety. When
the traffic at a South Bris-
bane intersection was at its
peak hour the other evening
a policeman on point duty
noticed a motor-truck ap-
proaching on a zig-zag
course. He promptly sig-
nalled the driver to stop,
thereby averting a collision
with a tram, after which he
escorted his victim to the
city watch-house and charged
him with drunkenness. The
watch-house constable was
unable to detect the usual
symptoms of drunkenness in
tile driver, but the arresting
constable persisted in the
charge and the prisoner ap-
peared before the Court next
day. The watch-house
keeper, however, stoutly as-
serted the man’s innocence,
while the driver was able
to prove that his steering-
gear was defective. The
accused was discharged, but
his appeal to be allowed costs
and compensation for wrong-
ful arrest was turned down
on the grounds that the over-
zealous constable had made
“an honest mistake” —poor
consolation for the victim of it.

“Sliollum” ; Death was cheated in a curi-
ous way the other day by a quarryman
working on a 90ft. incline near the town of
Dunedin. He was loosening a large rock
when a couple of hundredweight of it broke
off and cut the safety-rope that was tied
to his leg, the other end being secured to
the top of a cliff. Man and rock slid down
GOOD GUESS!
“Where do you think I got my calfskin coat?”
“I dunno —off some poor silly cow, I suppose”
the face for about 25 feet and had just
reached the edge of a straight 60ft. face
when the dangling rope got jambed by the
falling splinter of rock, which came to rest
and held the quarryman until he was rescued
by his mates. One philosopher who witnessed
the miraculous rescue said that the action of
the rock, in first nearly killing the man and
then in saving his life, reminded him of
Mclntosh’s Ayrshire bull tossing Sandy
McGreggor ower a stane dyke down at
Loeliiel station in the early ’sixties. The paral-
lel, it appeared, lay in the fact that the wee
bull saved the victim’s life because it couldn’t
jump the big fence itself.
* * * *
“M.G.S.”: Tree destruction in the vici-
nity of cities goes on briskly and it isn’t
always public bodies which are to blame. The
shire of Heidelberg (Vic.) was once re-
nowned among artists for its ancient red-
gums, some of them, according to tree biolo-
gists, 600 years old. The district having
been cut up into postage-stamp allotments,
even unto the remotest hills, these giants
have become the property of hundreds of
small land speculators living elsewhere. This
is where the privateer comes in. He goes
to the council and gets the address of the
owner, who is only too pleased to hear that
he can exchange his unwanted tenant for
four notes. Two men can fall an average
tree and knock 15 tons of firewood out of
it in a fortnight, and at 30s. a ton thus
barely earn the basic wage. Tiger Bill and
Co., who are at the moment engaged _in
removing the pride of the forest occupying
the vacant allotment next to mine, tell me
that they demolish an average of 200 trees a
year; and there are dozens 'of rival firms
working round about.
:J: i'fi
“Clerk” ; A recent application for employ-
ment in the Vic. railways was accompanied
by the following moving testimonial: —
I can proudly state that I have known my friend
Mr. A. for the past eight years, and he stands pre-
eminent as regards refinements, from every imaginable
standpoint, possessing a faculty seldom found among
gentlemen. I feel it almost impossible to express
my innermost feelings of him, his ability is unap-
proachable. I can recommend him to anyone in
search of a bosom friend.
The man w T anted a job as a carriage-cleaner.

“C. Coral” : This is the story old Maino,
the mamoose of Yam, told me of a visit to
a wreck at Bramble Cay in his remote
youth: “That time, I small boy. We no
got mission, no got law. My father he
mamoose belong Tutu : one day some whale-
boat pass alongside island, flanty man in-
side, so we know he got some ship fast
along reef. We take canoe, and by-’n’-by
catch Bramakee; he proper big ship, got
four mast. We come close to ; we see one
sailor sit along top-mast. We think he too
fright for we, so we makee signal for tell
him we no want kill him. My father he
say, ‘What kind white man that? He got
too much whisker along face and all over
body.’ We go aboard, then that man on
top he slew round, and we see he got tail!
We find out afterward he no proper white
man, he monkey belong that shipj When
we look round that ship we find plenty
grog, so we know that one English ship.
How we know that? Well, one ’nother
time before, we find Frenchman ship, and
he got wine along cask; English ship he
always got proper rum, burn you throat
like ’Ell! First time we find that rum, we
no savee for capsize water along him, we
drink bottle altogether one time, he too hot;
this time now we savee capsize water along
him. We find flour inside cask —we no savee
that one, we try roast him along fire but
he come no good. We find knife, tomahawk,
saucepan, and glass for shave face. This
time all them ship he savee road, so we
can’t get nothing from wreck. Them reef
he come up all time, though; perhaps by
’n’-by some ’nother ship he come fast!”

“R.W.K.” : At the Victorian Eye and Ear
Hospital the other day a deaf 13-year-01l
girl, putting on head-’phones for the first
time, immediately heard sounds of singing
and talking. The case is not altogether
unique. I know a woman who cannot con-
verse intelligently because of deafness, yet
who, when listening-in, is able to hear every
word; and a Sydney ear-doctor, lately back
from Vienna, brought a special wireless appa-
ratus for deaf people.
“Bunting ex-R.N.”: I can give “Stellsby”
another instance of a woman passenger be-
ing carried on a British battleship (B.
12/5/’27), and that in Australian waters.
I was a signalman on H.M.'S. Nelson
during her last commission on the Australian
station under the flag of Rear-Admiral Tryon
when we took the then Governor of N.S.W.,
Lord Carrington, and his wife on a trip to
Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and the
New Hebrides. This was in 'B6 or ’B7.
They left us on our return to Brisbane
and I believe they went up Brisbane River
in the gunboat Raven. The Nelson was a
second-class battleship of her period.
McCAFFERTY’S WHARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Round the bend, and back from the road,
By a manuka patch it stands,
Close to the forest where wood-carts load,
Built by a pair of resourceful hands,
Roof of shingle and walls of slab;
And there of a night we hold our swarry—
Tea from the billy, and smoke and gab,
When the fire burns red in McCafferty’s
whare.
Chaps who toil with the axe and saw,
Felling the wood for the near-by town,
Yarn of politics, work and law,
Laying their views with confidence down;
Maybe one who is short of a smoke,
Coming a bit of the weed to “borry,”
Joins in the barney or caps the joke—
Welcome are all in McCafferty’s whare.
Cheerful of face and strong of frame —
Swings his axe like the native-born —
Manly and decent, staunch and game,
( Gentleman still, to old standards sworn;
Always willing to lend his aid
To one who is late with his dray or lorry—-
Playing the game as it should be played,
Such is the host of McCafferty’s whare.
’Varsity man, so the gossips say,
Went the pace in old Dublin town,
Till they shipped him over the seas away,
And Fate in its kindness set him down
In a clean young land to begin anew —
It was here that the Devil lost his quarry;
For begin Mac did, and he triumphed, too !
So we know who visit McCafferty’s whare.
THEIR MISTAKE.
“Jean’s going to he married.”
“I thought she didn't believe in it.”
“M’ yes—so did the man.”
Yet there are times he sits silent there
Dreamily watching the back-log blaze—
Maybe reviewing the friends that were,
Ghost of his riotous college days.
But the mood soon goes and his keen face
shows
Nothing to hint he is hurt or sorry;
And once more the cheery argument flows
Through the tea and smoke in McCafferty’s
whare.

“Light Horse”: It really looks as
if something was going to be made
of the historic Dead Sea at last. Up
to now it has done little beyong sup-
plying material for tourists’ travel-
books ; but the Government of Pales-
tine, with the British Mandatory, pro-
poses to make a commercial asset of
it. Tenders are being called for a
25-years’ concession to extract the
Dead Sea’s potash contents. Bromide
and other salts, including sodium, are
present in very considerable propor-
tion—chemical solids are 25 per cent,
as opposed to 5 per cent, in ordinary
sea-water. The European supply of
potash is practically monopolised by
the German-Alsatian mines, run by
a Franco-German-Jewish combine. It
will be an ironical stroke of fate
if the European-Jew potash mono-
poly is threatened by another founded
in Palestine.

“Mapec”: The pluck and hardi-
hood the bush promotes in Austra-
lian youngsters is by no means con-
fined to one sex. Six-year-old Valma
Jentz, of Brookstead, Darling Downs
(Q.), was thrown from her pony while
on her way to school the other morn-
ing. Her leg was broken by the fall,
but when searchers found her at five
o’clock in ,the afternoon she had
crawled more than two miles in llie
direction of home. She had eaten
part of her lunch, which had been
thrown from the pony at the same
time as herself; the other part she
had reserved, she explained, as she
expected to be out all night. The
young heroine is now doing well in
Toowoomba Hospital.
X X X
“Darien”: Bank-tellers who leave
the straight and narrow path almost
always proffer the monotonous explan-
ation that the missing money was
“lost at the races.” It wasn’t always
so. Some years ago the cashier in a
large Melbourne bank was appointed
to the managership of another branch.
His successor, in taking over the cash,
discovered a very large shortage,
cleverly concealed during previous
checks of the cash. The new cashier
was an old friend of the officer about
to be promoted, and. at the latter's
earnest request and his emphatic
assurance that all would be “squared”
within a week or two, agreed to sign
for the cash as correct. The retiring
cashier left for his new post after re-
ceiving the usual presentations from
his colleagues, but about a week later
the new cashier was requested to have
his cash ready for audit. His nerve
failed him, and he confessed. The
chief offender was summoned to head-
office and taxed with his wrongdoing.
He calmly acknowledged that he had
“borrowed” the money, but insisted that
the full amount was well invested,
partly in certain tin shares that were boom-
ing at the time and partly in short-term
fixed deposits of another bank. His story
was found to be correct, and on realisation
the unauthorised investments showed quite
a nice little profit. H.O. scratched its
head for a bit and finally decided not to
prosecute. Two resignations closed the inci-
dent.
Hi Hi *
“Black Tracker”: I know a husband who
brought home in his motor some evidence
more compromising, at first glance, than a
girl’s handkerchief (B. 19/5/’27). He is
a newly-married doctor, and was called the
other night to attend a patient in the sub-
urbs of an Australian capital, the house
being next to one where a coming-of-age
party was in full and riotous blast. He
was kept later than he had anticipated, and
on leaving the house he hurriedly jumped
into his car and stepped on the gas. His
wife was anxiously awaiting his return ; the
storm burst when she saw what the medico
hadn’t noticed, that the back seat of the
car was occupied. The passenger was a
young girl in a semi-stupid state, who gazed
around her with startled eyes. Some ex-
pjanations followed, and the unintentionally-
kidnapped one was hurriedly returned to her
friends of the party.
* * * *
"Modestine”: Gisborne (M.L.) recently
celebrated its golden jubilee and it was deci-
ded to make the evolution of transport during
the 50 years a feature of the grand pro-
cession. The organisers’ difficulties began
when they sought to locate a bullock-waggon
and a set of coaching harness. North, south
and west went the searchers, but they had
to travel hundreds of miles before they found
the bullock-waggon and team. And when
they did the owner, realising that he had a
corner in his antiquated outfit, cannily de-
manded £2O for a thirty minutes’ walk up
the main street. The coaching harness was
gathered in from a hamlet 40 miles away,
and needed a lot of repair before it could be
made presentable even for a procession.

“Sol M.” : Apparently the wicked baronet,
once a beloved asset of the fictionist (the
lady fictionist especially), isn’t altogether
extinct. One of the brand is accused of
having lured a Maid of Kent out on a late
motor ride, reduced her to the nude, covered
her with boot varnish, and abandoned her to
sheep and other animals in timbered country.
The result was that a young lady of polished
exterior arrived at a strange house in an
embarrassing condition about sunrise. The
conduct of the assailant is set down to drink,
GETTING THEIR WAVE LENGTH.
“Thought-reading by wireless is being experimented with in Victoria, listeners-in
being required to guess the name of various objects ‘concentrated’ on by a committee
in the Broadcasting Studio.”
MR. TAXPAYER (listening-in): “I’ve got it, Mother—TAX REDUCTION!”
but the habitual and orthodox book baronet
was not intoxicated nor even eccentric —he
was just plain wicked. A notable specimen,
described as “a bold, bad man” (the first
“bold, bad man” on record) was Francis
Levison, created by Mrs. Henry Wood in her
most maudlin publication. The sanity of the
wicked baronet being recognised, he seldom
pleads mental disorder after polishing or
polishing off a girl, though it is a good
defence in the case of almost anybody else.
Humanitarians have even advanced the
theory that the Devil is off his head, and that
makes all the trouble.
Hi ❖ ❖ Hi
“C. Coral”: Among “mystery ships” may
be included the Sally (mentioned by
“Gouger” in a recent par.), from which a
bell was retrieved some years ago on a
reef near Thursday Island. The bell in
question bears on one side “Sally” and on
the other “Triumph,” but up to the present
its origin is quite unknown. There are two
vessels of the name of Sally in the long list
of wrecks compiled by Commander Bayldon
in the “Australian Encyclopaedia,” one having
gone down in 1812, but neither finished its
career on our north-east coast. Another
ship of which no record can be discovered
is the Joseph Tvedestrand, whose bell sum-
mons the native congregation of Yam Island
to church. There is a bell at Coconut
Island without a name, which came from
a ship wrecked near Mount Ernest (Torres
Strait). Another sort of mystery ship was
the Root Hog or Die, a pearling vessel which
left Brisbane in the ’seventies for the islands,
the captain promising his wife that he would
be back again within a few months. That
was the last seen or heard of the skipper,
but later on the ship turned up in Torres
Strait under a different captain. The Strait
has a good many tragedies and romances
tucked away amongst its reefs and islands.
“Ring Bolt”: It is true that the Renown
did not berth at Hobart in 1920 (B.
12/5/'27), but she did on her last visit, and
that without the assistance of a pilot. Com-
mander McArthur, Hobart’s harbormaster,
put off according to schedule in the Marine
Board’s launch and met the incomer off One
Tree Point, but the battleship did not stop
and the launch was left rolling in her wake.
It was afterwards ascertained that the cap-
tain of the Renown knew nothing of the
arrangements made for pilotage until he saw
the official programme after the boat was
tied up. Whereupon he remarked that the
conditions for berthing in the harbor of Sul-
livan’s Cove were so perfect that no assist-
ance was needed.
“Sea Nomad”: Unlucky stones? Years
ago, when the Yongala went down off the
east coast of York Peninsula, Hughie Gib-
lett was cutting sandalwood near Lloyd’s
Bay. The niggers brought him a wicker-
work basket with some clothes in it, picked
up on the beach. There was a shirt
with a set of sleeve-links and studs of rolled
gold, inset with a gem supposed to bring
ill-luck. Later Giblett spent a holiday in
Thursday Island and offered the trinkets
to Serenalis, the jeweller. The latter was
superstitious and at first refused to deal, but
finally he bought the links and put them
in his window on the off-chance of a buyer.
Fate sent him an engineer from the Koom-
bana. She sailed and was never heard of
again, going down in a cyclone off the West-
ralian coast as suddenly as the Yougala had
done.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: On a recent tour through
the Darling Downs (Q.) I met a carload of
holiday-makers from Newcastle (N.S.W.)
comprising four generations. There were
nine passengers altogether—a great-grand-
mother, her daughter and son-in-law, her
grand-daughter and grandson-in-law and a
two-months-old baby. The car was an anti-
quated contraption which had travelled over
30,000 miles, and, despite rain and blacksoil
mud, its occupants made it clear that they
were having the time of their lives. We left
them at Helidon. heading for Brisbane, and
in no way dashed by the news that all the
creeks were up and that dozens of cars were
stuck on the road ahead.
“C. Coral”: In the early days a settlement
was established at the top end of Cape
York for the benefit of shipwrecked seamen,
and as a place of call for ships passing
through Torres Strait. The first site chosen
was on Albany Island, but later the settle-
ment was removed to Somerset, and ulti-
mately in ’79 to Thursday Island. There
are a number of graves on Albany Island.
One is the resting-place of the first Govern-
ment resident, Christopher D’Oyly Hay
Aplin, who was at one time collector of
customs in Labuan and afterwards Govern-
ment geologist in Victoria ; he died in 1875.
The inscription mentions that “He fitly lies
by the side of the companions of his friend
Kennedy, at whose grave he assisted to
plant cocoanut trees 26 years before.” The
memorial slab (of wood) from these graves
is in Thursday Island town museum, but
there are no signs of any cocoanut-trees.
Near-by is buried Mrs. Turner, wife of the
first medical man in Papua (he was a mem-
ber of the London Missionary Society), and
there are other un-named graves. On the
mainland opposite rests a Captain McAus-
land, who died in ’74, and the Jardine
brothers, pioneers of the North. The old
settlement at Somerset, once a scene of
activity, is now deserted excepting by a care-
taker, but the spot is one with which some
of the earliest history of the North is linked
“The McHaggis” : How hard the old
Adam dies in the most modernised of
us is seen in the latest outbreak of
the 500-year-old feud between the
Cameron and Campbell clans in High-
land Scotland. The feud, after smoul-
dering more or less since the Jacobite-
Whig upheaval of 1745, from which
the Campbells emerged triumphant,
has been blown into flame by a prosaic
Campbell county council asking for
official permission to annex a portion
of a Cameron district, a request which
has sent the Camerons rushing to the
modern equivalents for claymore and
target. Not the rank and file, either,
but such chieftains as Cameron of
Locliiel and the Mackintosh of Mackin-
tosh, who both said things at the
Cameron council about the Campbells
and their chief, the Duke of Argyle,
which were better suited to the atmo-
sphere of Sydney City Council. Both
chief tains went back to the 280-year-
old battle of Inverlochy, when the
Camerons and tlieir allies towelled up
the Campbells, as proof of their will-
ingness to start another rough-house
going, if necessary. The usquebagh up
Inverness way has evidently lost none
of its old punch.
* * *
“G.8.L.”: The latest issue of the
Royal Australian Historical Society’s
Journal contains an article by C. A.
Irish on “Names of Railway Stations
in N. S. Wales, with their meaning
and origin,” which should prove of
interest to Bulletin philologists. The
town of Antiene, according to the
writer, was originally called Toowong,
but as there was a Brisbane suburb
of the same name a prominent local
resident of Irish extraction wrote to
the Postal Department suggesting the
alteration of the name to Antrim. The
department was quite ready to oblige
him, but failed to decipher his writing,
and Antiene was the result. Beckom
is a corruption of Beckham, the maiden
name of the wife of the first squatter
there. Cliatswood is named after the
wife of a pioneer named Richard Har-
nett. Coif’s Harbor, on the North
Coast, was discovered by Captain
Korff. Cronulla is scheduled as an
abo. corruption of the name of John
Connell, who owned land there. Here,
however, the writer is at variance
with an older authority, F. Cridland,
who in his “Story of Port Hacking,
Cronulla and Sutherland ,shire,” states
that Cronulla or Kurranulla was the
abos.’ own name for “small pink-
colored seashells” found on the beach
there. The name Nulabor, on the
Junee-Hay line, is also credited with
being aboriginal, but this is very
doubtful. It is much more likely that
the original christener had in his
mind the same two words of Horace
which gave the Nullarbor Plain its
name. The only difference is that
three letters have been dropped in
the first case and only one in the
second.
;js * *
“Lista”: It happened at Kingaroy
(Q.) at a shivoo where Brig.-Gen.
Caiman was the big-gun of the even-
ing. The chairman, a well-known
cattle-dealer, got along swimmingly
till he introduced “our distinguished
guest, Brigadier-General Cannan.
C.M.G., D.S. O light!” The titter that
began in the front seats swelled to a roar
as a loud voice from the back shouted, “Yer
mixin’ the brands, Jo!”
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: Jane Transcontinental Hodge
was added to the population of Australia
recently. At least, that is what her name
ought to be. She was born in the overland
express between Cook (W.A.) and Kal-
goorlie, while her mother, a fettler’s wife,
was speeding for the hospital.
A SONG OF CITIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hear the din—the city’s tongue—
Ever old and ever young.
Thirty centuries have gone
Since I was in Babylon, .
In the fleeting years between
Troy and Rome and Ur I’ve seen;
Tramped tlieir streets and learnt their songs,
Shared their hates and felt their wrongs,
Known the magic of tlieir name—
Cities, lad, are all the same.
This your Sydney by the sea
Can say nothing new to me.
Throned upon an ocean wide,
Swelling up with sinful pride,
Tributed by sea and land,
Spending with a lavish hand,
As did Carthage once, I trow—
Where is lordly Carthage now?
Bustling thousands throng the street;
Morn to eve the tramp of feet
Tells its tale vociferous;
Who and what are they to us?
Strangers all —that damsel smiles !
Laddie, those are wanton’s wiles.
All the arts that cities please
Had their source with things like these.
Cities! in you still we find
Grim machines that crush and grind.
Still you tickle our desire
As did Nineveh and Tyre.
Cities’ needs are very old—
Water, bread, and bricks, and gold.
Pulsing, lusting, deep and strong,
Runs the tide of life along
Cities wax and cities wane.
Goth and Hun will come again;
Come with rapine, fire and sword,
Alien hands in cherished hoard.
Mortar, bricks and stones may yield
To a dreary potter’s field.
Death and dust—so goes the game.
Cities, lad, are all the same.
N.S.W.
LLYRAM.
THAT FELLOW WINTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He brawls along the city streets
And pushes round the corners;
He bustles everyone he meets —
The Jacks and Sally Horners.
From out the West he does his best,
By none’s desire, by none’s request.
If he was dead, this sharp-toothed guest.
There’d few of us be mourners.
He bats you round the ins and outs
Where they are short and narrow;
You can’t escape his stinging clouts.
They strike you to the marrow.
You grab your hat, your back is bent;
He hurtles dust and loose cement.
I think, by mutual consent,
He is the Devil’s harrow!
N.S.W.

“Brom”: A recent reference to the old
P’ran (Vic.) identity who used to travel
round professing to believe that he was a
horse reminds me of another eccentric who
kept Chapel-street agane for many a week.
He was a tall, smartly-suited, elderly man
of classic countenance who rode daily up
and down that thoroughfare gravely raising
his hat to the populace. With the salute
would come a slight inclination of the head,
and the whole thing was performed with
such old-world courtesy that no one needed
to be told he was under the delusion that
he was the Governor. He disappeared ulti-
mately—no one knew where—a passing ex-
citement in the life of a suburb that has
had a few shocks in the course of its history.

“Peejeff”: The modern Bung would never
dream of trying to advertise his wares by
humorously disparaging them. But in the
good old quartz-thumping days this is how
a Peelwood (N.S.W.) boniface boosted his
pub in the local rag: “Notice to travellers !
Old Charley Stewart is still running the
Peelwood Hotel, where the very worst of
grog may be got, for bluestone, arsenic and
stingaree tobacco are used freely. The tables
are disgusting, as the smell of an oilrag is
the only food obtainable. Any person seeking-
repose there at night will need to be a
good wrestler, for the bugs are well prac-
tised in holts. As for the stabling accommo-
dation, it is quite easy to lose your boots in
the mud of the floor.” Charlie, it is almost
needless to add, kept the best hotel on the
field.

“X2X” : Speaking of the real or imaginary
swallowing of false teeth (B. 12/5/’2T),
some years ago a middle-aged woman who
complained of an excruciating pain in her
side was admitted to a Syd-
ney suburban hospital and,
as a result of the diagnosis
concerning the origin of the
pain, it was decided to oper-
ate. However, all the pati-
ent’s internal organs proved
quite normal, whereupon the
operating - surgeon did a
little exploring. To his
amazement, a complete upper
plate, with one tooth broken
off the front of it, was dis-
covered in the lady’s intes-
tinal tract, where, appa-
rently, it had been lodged
for some time. The patient,
on being questioned later,
stoutly insisted that she had
never swallowed any dental
fixings; the only mishap in
this line she could remember
was that she had once lost
her plate for some days, but
had been lucky enough to re-
cover it again. The only
conclusion at which the doc-
tors could arrive was that
actually she had swallowed
the plate which she had
thought she had lost, the one
found a little later being a
different one altogether. She
had carried the first one about for several
years before its presence began to trouble
her.

“Mono”: A story still lingers in the Upper
Murray district of a well-known grazier who
regarded a certain paddock on his station
w r ith real affection. “I hope nobody ever
selects that bit of
ground,” he used to say.
“It’s my pet lamb!”
Later, he had a quarrel
with one of his overseers,
who promptly left his ser-
vice to take up farming-
on his own account. He
applied for a selection on
his former employer’s
property and managed to
get possession of the
favorite paddock, o n
which he forthwith built
ONE OF THOSE VERSATILE PLAGES.
“What’s the shack you’ve put up by the creek,
Dad?”
“Well, if some week-end fools’ll take it, it’s
a bungalow; if not, it’s a hay-barn."
a wayside house and secured a license there-
for. With fine irony he christened it “The
Pet Lamb Hotel”!

“The Listening-Insect” : This achievement
in passing things on must be close to a
record. An attempt was made the other
morning to make the canned entertainment
broadcast by 2LO in London available to
owners, of lowly crystal-sets in this country.
The Victorian arrangements were a remark-
able example of co-ordination. The sounds
omitted by the big London station were
picked up by the Philips station in Holland,
a private concern run by the makers of the
electric-light globes. Philips amplified them
and passed them on a shorter wave-length.
Maxwell Howden, of Box Ilill, received them
on a short-wave superhet. receiver, amplified
them once more, and hurried them per the
ordinary phone to S. IV. Gadsden, who lives
at Kew. .This gentleman re-disseminated the
noises with such success that you could
almost hear the pianist in London run his
fingers through his hair.

“K. 0.” : The desperate attempts made to
refloat the River-
ina recall to me
the pother when
the old Mon-owai,
now serving as a
breakwater at Gis-
borne (M.L.), ran
aground in Noumea
Harbor with half
the Samoan occupa-
tionary force on
board. To add to
the skipper’s per-
plexities a bevy of
naval officers from
Australia insisted
o n overwhelming
him with free
advice. A propo-
sal to hook the
Australia on and
drag the Monowai
into deep water
was rejected i n
favor of a scheme
for racing tli e
engines while the
troops rolled the
ship about in her
mud bed. The lat-
ter effect was ob-
tained by parading
r>oo men in full kit
on the port side,
and at given sig-
nals rushing them
to starboard and
back. For a change,
every now and
then they scrambled
fore and aft, fall-
ing over winches,
jostling through
companion ways
and making the
air blue with pro-
fanity. But the old
ship never moved
an inch. Half an
hour of this tom-
foolery in Maori-
land winter-kit in
the tropics was fol-
lowed by the order
to unload the coal.
All shovelling re-
cords were broken,
so that the ship
might be lightened
by full tide. Then,

A FASHIONABLE COMPLAINT.
GERTIE: “Poor Bertie! I’m afraid he suffers from matrimonial
dyspepsia.”
R EGINALD: “Whatever’s that?”
G ERTIE: “Oh, you know —his wife doesn’t agree with him.”
full-speed astern, she backed out of the mud-
bank, and the French sailors on the battle-
ship Montcalm joined in the roar of acclama-
tion.
“Nonton Iki”: Railway-travelling on the
never is becoming more and more prevalent
in Queensland ; there were no less than 166
prosecutions during the month of March, and
most railway men reckon that not one
offender in 20 is caught. The luckless excep-
tion is generally the man who travels right
into the bigger towns instead of judiciously
dropping off at the last stop a few miles
out. Empty stock-trucks or open waggons
are the most popular means of transit; but
some train-jumpers prefer to travel in com-
fort, not to say luxuriously. There are gen-
erally motor-cars covered with tarpaulins on
the night goods-trains, and these are fre-
quently availed of. One philosopher who
was recently extracted from his flying lair
by an officious railway officer had the motor
light on and was lying back calmly reading
a magazine!
* * *
“C. Bumpkin”: Victoria Dock, Melbourne,
enjoyed the spectacle of a 6000-ton steamer
running amok the other day. When the
motor-ship Unicoi, of the U.S. Shipping
Board, broke her chain in a gale, the tug
Tooronga tried to butt her back into her
kennel, but the excited craft retaliated b.v
attempting to crush the intervener against
the Corrimal. The Tooronga gave one terri-
fied snort and rushed for safety; whereupon
the infuriated vessel, after taking a look at
the 8.1. cadet ship Wangaratta and the
Dutchman Tapanoeli, bore down upon the
defenceless little Corrimal. The whariies on
the Corrimal, shouting wildly to their col-
leagues down below, leapt for the shore; but
by this time the Unicoi had done her dash
and the Tooronga was enabled to fasten her
teeth in the distracted vessel’s ear and drag
her home again. Over a thousand people
watched the fray, and, as amokking levia-
thans move slowly, they had a whole after-
noon’s amusement.
CAMP MEDLEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In camping-days of youth elate I pitched my
tent at Golden Gate,
A torn and tattered six-by-eight without
a break or fly.
I hung a blanket at my door, then carried
chaff-bags from the store
. And rigged a bunk above the floor to hold
me high and dry.
Oh, what a spacious camping plot that
proudly titled mining lot
For fortune-hunters polyglot who humped
their baggage west!
The spieling fan, the reckless man, the
gambling clique, the Highland clan,
The hum with bag and billycan, the ser-
mon-singing pest.
They mustered all, the big and small, the
staunch and straight, the short and
tall,
The hefty bully of the brawl, the battler
and the tug.
Nevada Bill and Sandy Mack, the Dago and
the Cousin Jack,
The grinning Alabama black, the sprinter
and the pug.
Bold Irish voices here and there rose oft at
evening to declare
The charms of. Dublin or Kildare, and
Shannon’s gliding stream ;
And miles of discord woke to kill the sound
of stamps along the hill;
THOUGHT HE WAS A BENEFACTOR.
“So he ran away with your daughter, eh? It’s a wonder
you ever allowed the bounder in your house.”
“But I didn’t suspect anything! I thought he was just
keen on my wife.”
The thunder of a distant mill, the clash
of steel and steam.
The Sabbath night was rent with runes of
Creswick, Bendigo or Clunes;
With crazy concertina tunes, mouth-organs
vamping fast;
The banjo strumming through the din, accor-
dion and violin.
Shrill whistles wrought of brass and tin
and trombones full a-blast.
Euphonium and flute and fife in medley of
discordant strife
Disturbed the peaceful camper’s life and
plundered hours of rest.
While round a torch-lamp’s sickly blaze a
Band of Hope sang hymns of praise,
A Frenchman raved le Marseillaise with
patriotic zest.
Inspired by sentiment (or beer) men sang
of home and mother dear;
A sailor roared “Oh, let me steer a course
to Rio Bay!”
A Scotsman bellowed “Auld Lang Syne,” a
German sang “Die Wacht am Rhein,”
A Yankee chanted “Forty-Nine” or “Inde-
pendence Day.”
With canvas fortress fiercely held, a choir
in Welsh crescendo swelled,
While every neighboring note was quelled
. till midnight whistles spoke.
The piccolo and tenor-horn breathed unto each
their tutored scorn,
A double-bass with growls forlorn far
depths of doom awoke.
One Sunday eve, ere darkness fell, a certain
stranger came to dwell
Beside my tent. I wished him well, but
when the night was late
From out the portal of his lair a bagpipe
summons filled the air—
Next morning, crushed with dumb despair,
I moved from Golden Gate.
N.s.w.

The div. has gone up—“at last,” many share-
holders will add. But the super-fatness of it
is something of a delusion, inasmuch as new
capital issued of recent years has carried a
heavy premium. Since 1906 portion of the
distribution each year has been marked
“bonus.” The board has decided, however,
that the 14 p.c. may now be considered all
dividend, an indication that it can see nothing
in sight that is likely to disturb an annual
distribution at that rate. Gross profits
admitted were within reach of the record:—

1926 . . 1,516,376 584,400 279,354
Expenditure was heavier, but the increase
(£31,238) in gross earnings plus a cut in
English taxation of £ll,OOO supplied suffici-
ent justification for disclosing a record net
figure of £652,621.
There seems little immediate likelihood of
expenditure being slashed down, but the
steady progress in earnings almost wholly
frees the outlook from uncertainty so far as
shareholders are concerned. Portion of
Queensland has experienced a severe drought
and Victoria has had a dry spell; but the
Commonwealth’s general prosperity still
holds. A general setback is not in sight, but
the banker is working on the assumption that
on the law of averages something nasty can-
not be far away. Chairman Kenneth Goschen,
at the annual meeting in London, emphasised
what this Column lias pointed out many
times: the significance and danger of the
widespread growth of the t.-p. evil. The
banks are being asked for large accommoda-
tion by cos. whose business it is to sell on
the instalment plan, either direct or by ordei’3
on other firms, and Mr. Goschen declares that
the banks are alive to the danger. The assur-
ance is good news —to all except the t.-p.
finance cos.
Here are the balance-sheet movements of

Premises . . 47,351 79,306 72,280
Deposits increased in the 12 months by
almost £685,000. Total liabilities amounted
at the balance to £34,263,122, of which
£14,660,075 was represented by liquids—a
solid position. To cover the. other
£19.603,047, there were advances in the books
at £27,776,275 and the premises. The bank
occupies a position of remarkable strength,
for it holds only £4 6s. 3d. of outside money
for each £1 of its own, in addition to which
are its heavy inner reserves: premises, for
instance, appear at £72,280, yet the buildings
which house its offices in London, Australia
and Maoriland must be worth a million
pounds, and those in the capital cities are
splendid letting propositions. ’Asia shares
have always been popular, though not largely
dealt in on Australian ’Changes, and for
years have moved but slightly. Latest
sales, however, were at higher 'levels.

There has been a capitalisation of reserves
and 50,000 ordinary shares have been dis-
tributed to ordinary holders. Also, author-
ised capital has been increased to £1,000,000,
of which 200,000 shares—to be known as
“D” shares—are to be p.c. cum. prefs.,
participating with ordinaries to 10 p.c. Par-
ticipation rights do not appear to have any
immediate value, for the best ordinaries
have received since 1914 has been S p.c.,
and the average over the past 12 years has
been under 51 p.c. But with £300,000 of
pref. capital coming before the new lot, some-
thing extra has to be done to make the
shares look attractive. Not more than
300,000 “D” shares are to be issued until
such time as ordinary share capital and
reserves together total £380,000, or £lOO,OOO
more than at present.
The interests of this holding co. are now
chiefly in Arthur Rickard and Co., Ltd.,
property salesmen, and IJaymarket P. L., B.
and I. Co.; of the former’s 350,000 £1 shares
it holds the lot, and 49,994 of the 50,000
£2 shares in Haymarket, 272 shares having
been acquired during tile year. A few years
ago it held all the ords. and most of the
prefs. in Hotel Sydney (100,874 of the
130,000 in 1923), but that holding lias been
cut down each year; a further 18,800 shares
were sold last term, reducing its interest to
16,200 shares. There are other investments,
including an interest in Melbourne Hotels,
Ltd., which runs the modernised Windsor.
This latter co. is improving, but its last
accounts showed over two years’ arrears of
divs. on the prefs.
Earnings last year consisted of £28.383
from the Arthur Rickard subsidiary. £5999
from the Haymarket, £2630 divs. from Hotel
Sydney, £1271 interest and £3855 on the sale
of the Hotel Sydney shares. The figures
were better than usual: it was, indeed, the
best term since the peak in 1920. Hay-
market increased its reserves during the year
by £5OOO, almost entirely the surplus on the
sale of one of its city properties; the sum
was incorporated in the parent’s reserves.
The co. intends to use the money raised
from the issue of the “D” shares to replace
money borrowed bv subsidiaries. This is
how the family stood at December 31 in
the matter of outside debt:—

Haymarket Land .. 37,733 7,032 566

£828,664
A. R., Ltd., owed £188,539 to outsiders ex-
clusive of £67,893 advanced by the parent.
Haymarket’s outside debt amounted to
£45,332. Obviously additional capital is
necessary. With £271,013 in city properties
and unsold land and property, it will be
necessary to do some brisk selling to im-
prove the position and supply divs. for the
new capital. Also, property purchases for
future operations will need to be at advan-
tageous prices. The fact that city property
prices have been hitting the sky has meant
little to the two subsidiaries, which are con-
cerned chiefly with suburban and country
subdivisions. Apart from a few high-priced
areas, however, the real-estate market does
not appear to be over-bright, and that does
not assist to gild the outlook so far as A. R.
Extended is concerned. Considering the
prosperous conditions which ruled, the profit
last year was nothing to cheer about. In good
times land-selling cos. should win very good
returns in order to offset the lean* times
when they win very lean returns. In the
circumstances 6 p.c. was a poor harvest for
ordinaries. The prefs. are listed, and the
best protected class were sold recently at
20s. 4|d.; the second prefs. have sellers at
19s.

Profits were affected by the central and
northern drought; the good rains which fell
over most of the State in January and Feb-
ruary have cheered traders, and the directors
considered the outlook bright enough to jus-
tify 8 p.c. for the term. Yet a consistent
seller at 16s. 6d. on Brisbane ’Change has
not attracted a buyer recently; and as at
16s. these shares show a 10 p.c. return, what’s
the matter? In the past five years the divi-
dend has averaged a faint whisper under 7
p.c., and the net profits _ have been £4326
more than enough to pay it. The margin is
certainly not wide; not wide enough to jus-
tify one in saying that the 7 p.c. is quite a
safe thing. Gross profit, even allowing for
the increase of capital, has been moving up
all right:—
1914. . £109,104 I 1922. . £141,388 j 1926. . £186,031
1918.. 134,312 | 1925. . 174,251 ( 1927. . 179,914
But exes, have moved briskly too, and the co.
has not got much out of the larger trading.
Competition has been very keen; and all that
the shareholders have received so far as a
set-off against the rather disappointing profit
is the assurance that the management is
grappling with the situation and expects to
show much better net returns when weather
conditions are more favorable to the hack-
country, which, apart from city trade, is
Finney-Isles’ sheet-anchor.
Balance-sheet movements last year were
not important:—

Stocks were valued “strictly on the basis of
present worth” ; and the co.’s building, which
occupies a big area in the heart of the city,
seems to be conservatively valued. Its extent
is, of course, one of the reasons why the co.
doesn’t find it easy to earn more than 7 p.c.
or so; after allowing for the mortgage no
less than £103,932 of the capital of £275,993
is sunk in premises and fixtures. By and bye,
when a decent reserve fund lias been built up,
things will be easier. Meantime shareholders
mustn’t be greedy and kick the heels of the
directors even should the latter go a bit
slower with dividends.

The div. was kept at 7 p.c., although earn-
ings from investments alone were £1307 in
excess of that amount. But it is a conserva-
tive board, and its declared policy is to build
up reserves during the co.’s _ infancy. It
certainly is a very healthy child. Although
only six years old, it has paid a total of
20 p.c. in divs., accumulated £20,000 in a
general reserve (its paid capital is £90,175),
has £40,000 set aside to cover unexpired
risks, and £1929 is undistributed in p. and 1.
account. Nor is that all, for establishment
costs, furniture and stationery have been
charged against revenue. On this occasion
the reserve which the co. has set aside specifi-
cally for unexpired risks is under the usual
40 p.c. When the new Workers’ Compensa-
tion was brought into force in N. S. Wales
in July last the co. accepted everything it
believed it could carry with safety. At the
balancing date nine months of most of these
risks had expired, so a full 40 p.c. provision
was unnecessary. In other departments, too,
it was a brisk 12 months —on the claims side
especially:—

1927.. 132,600 85,683 36,392 64.6 „ 27.4 „
The way that loss ratio is climbing up would
be disconcerting if it were not accompanied
by a large increase in business written at a
lower cost. In 1923 there was an under-
writing profit of 15.6 p.c.; last year it was
only 8 p.c. But £40,049 written at a total
cost in exes, and losses of 84.4 p.c. was worth
only £6247 to the co., whereas last vear
£132,600 written at a total cost of 92 p.c.
was worth £10,608.
Returns from investments should be
increased substantially this term: the co.’s
seven-storeyed building, in a splendid situa-
tion in Melbourne, is now complete, and
rentals will swell the figures at March 31
next. Allowing for a net 5 p.c. from the
property, the management will be in a posi-
tion, should it so desire, to pay 10 p.c. on
the present capital from its investments
alone, leaving a nice amount plus the whole
of the underwriting surplus to be set aside.
Assets are all of excellent quality:—

The big Workers’ Compensation business
occupied most of the co.’s attention during
the year; no further branches were opened
up. However, an. agency arrangement has
been made at Fiji, and further plans for
expansion are under consideration.
An interesting point in connection with
the co.’s shares is that they were recently
quoted on the market at a rate which was
relatively higher than that of the Queens-
land Insurance, which might be considered
its uncle. There have been sales at 295. 6d.
(the shares are £1 paid to 10s.), at which
price the return is 2§ p.c.—very flattering.

Exes, are moving along quickly, too; five
years ago they were under 70 p.c. of com-
mission earnings; to-day they are well over
80 p.c. Nevertheless, and though that move-
ment wants watching, the 10 p.c. div. was
comfortably earned, though many another
trustee co. puts more by. Of assets total-
ling £34,427- —there were no liabilities —
£29,416 was in Government securities and
cash; £1450, mortgages; £2119 advances to
estates, etc.; and £1442 in furniture, accrued
interest, etc. The co.’s steady progress
makes the 10.p.c. pretty sure. There is, of
course, also always the possibility of calls
on present capital—the 200,000 £l. shares
are paid only to 2s. 6d. each —but there
shouldn’t be anything doing that way till
the lay-by is a good deal larger. Meantime
there are' great expectations, and the shares
command a shade over 65., at which price
they yield the investor only £4 3s. 4d. p.c.

Next Saturday, June 4, the Wild Cat
Monthly will be on sale. It will be found
even more useful to investors than its pre-
decessors. The recent success of the
Monthly has been so remarkable that it
has been possible to make large improve-
ments in it; and there is now nothing else
like it in Australia. Besides an examina-
tion of the accounts of nearly 50 public
cos., there is, in the June number, a dis-
section of new issues, a “biography" of
Elder, Smith and Co., mining news (with
an especially valuable Malayan service'' and
“Points for Investors." The object through-
out is to be of practical service to investors;
to lead them away from failures and point
them to successes is the object kept always
in view. The published price is 2s. per
copy ; 22s 6d. per annum posted from The
Bulletin Office.

The Development and Migration Com-
mission which has been wrestling with the
problem presented by Australia’s declining
gold yield has presented an interim report
on the subject. It deals chiefly with the
Kalgoorlie area and the Sons of Gwalia, at
Leonora, and is along the lines forecasted
by this Column. The investigation covered
a wide field, but the essential point was
a consideration of the economic value of
the gold industry to Australia. Inevitably
the State chiefly considered was Westralia.
The Commission records the steady decline
in gold production from 1904, but points out
that during the war years the cos. maintained
production at the expense of the future.
Arising out of the war costs have increased,
and the increase appears to be permanent.
The Commission considers it desirable to
prolong the life of the Kalgoorlie field because
of the type of worker attracted to the coun-
try ; the serious results if the industry were
suddenly closed down ; and the necessity of
maintaining the confidence of overseas inves-
tors who have considerable capital invested in
the State.
The Commission, which has had the benefit
of the advice of a technical committee headed
by W. E. Wainwright, general manager of
the Broken Hill South, who personally
measured up some of the Westralian mines,
states that uneconomical plant and lack of
proper exploration and development work
have played a big part in the present unsatis-
factory position at Kalgoorlie. Cos. are re-
ferred to as having made “maximum distribu-
tions to shareholders and to have grievously
disregarded the future of the industry.” The
Commission recommends amalgamation, with
underground consolidation as an essential
preliminary, and is in accord with Kingsley
Thomas in his main conclusions.
So far as the Kalgoorlie area is concerned
the Commission summarises its opinion thus:
(1) If the life of the field is to be considerably
prolonged, a thorough re-organisation of existing
methods is an immediate necessity.
(2) Notwithstanding past neglect of development,
money may well be spent to ascertain reserves.
(3) Amalgamation of the mines at the western
end of the field should be immediately finalised in
the hope that the mines at the eastern end will
co-operate in the near future.
(4) Following on amalgamation money will be
required to carry out immediate improvements, under-
ground and surface, to enable the extended Lake
View and Star to treat 25,000 tons of ore monthly
at a profit; and for an intensive geological survey to
determine as to what later expenditure will be
justified.
(5) The amalgamated co. is recommended to raise
money by the issue of shares, to which special con-
ditions will apply.
Thereupon follows a clear statement that
the Commission’s recommendations to the
Commonwealth and State Governments will
he governed by the measures taken by the
companies and the workers to re-organise the
industry.
Plant and equipment, both surface and
underground, at the Sons of Gwalia, is con-
sidered to be efficient and the management
economical. Plere the Commission considers
an intensive development campaign necessary
if the mine is to continue. It suggests the
expenditure of £78,000 for development and
new plant spread over 18 months or two
years, and considers that allowing 2s. per
ton for development costs an annual profit
of £25.000 could he anticipated on a monthly
12,000 to 14,000 tons.
Devon (W.A.) has another manager who
is confident of success. Hitherto although
again and again declared to have good pros-
pects and “divs. in sight,” the show has
proved only a sink for shareholders’ cash.
Now it is stated that rich ore is being mined
and the first clean-up from the remodelled
mill is expected early in June. The “Wild
Cat” will be surprised if the show comes up
to official expectations.

A. E. Faul, who did good work at the
Great Victoria, Yilgarn (W.A.), and lately
in charge of operations conducted by a co.
floated to reopen the Sand Queen and Glad-
some at Comet Vale (W.A.), has thrown up
the job. Hike the Edna May at Westonia,
the Sand Queen and Gladsome were deluged ;
but, whereas in the former case the water
contained only about 8 per cent, salt, the
Sand Queen fluid is saline almost to satu-
ration point, and that adds to the diffi-
culties. The list of successes achieved, other
than by prospectors and tributors, in re-
opening heavily watered shows in W.A. is
a very short one.
* * *
Since its tributors have been overwhelm-
ing it with gold bars, Great Boulder Co.
has been giving the public fewer details of
its monthly output. For May shareholders
had to he satisfied with “8128 tons treated
for £24,001; expenditure £22,561.” Gross
value of the recovery from 8128 tons is all
right, but shareholders are entitled to some
details concerning the expenditure of £22,561,
which is an extremely high figure.

By special request of the board, State
Mining-Engineer Montgomery is inspecting
and sampling Wiluna mines (W.A.). Mean-
while immense bodies of mostly good-grade
ore are being opened up and the co.’s experts
are busy experimenting to determine the most
economical method of gold extraction.
Cheaper transport as well as successful treat-
ment is, however, needed to enable Wiluna
to do its best, and Montgomery’s mission is
to see whether developments warrant early
railway communication. From all accounts
they do.

F. L. Thomas is still at Captain’s Flat
(N.S.W.) opening up for the option-holders,
National Mining Corporation of London, and
the belief gains gropnd that the N.M.C. has
come to stay. Thomas is a high-power
expert, who has done very well for the Corp.
elsewhere; but the absence of a railway over
the 27 miles to Bungendore troubles him.

Tanami (N.T.) receded to a shilling
last week on an announcement that “the
suction-gas trouble has not yet been over-

procure so far afield. The plant should not

The first run of the Stanhills (N.Q.)
battery, mentioned in this Column a few
weeks back, covered trial lots only, ranging
from a couple of tons to 40 tons, from 18
different shows. The values have now been
tabulated. The Mauretania ore returned
8 p.c. concentrates, the Brilliant topped the
trials with 10 p.c., others ran down below
2 p.c. Some shows have been dropped by
the way and others are bucked up by the
results. Among the bucked are the Wonder,
Gift, Mauretania and Cassiterite North;
these have again resumed operations. Two
tons of picked ore from the Gift averaged
£4O a ton, while the Cassiterite group gen-
erally was disappointing. Prospectors are
out looking for alluvial, but thus far nothing
payable has been found.

The new coalfield at Mulgeldie, on the
Upper Burnett (Q.), has had the tape run
over it by geologist J. H. Reid. It turns
out to be a small, shallow field —area, 30
sq. miles; depth, about 500 ft. —and carries
five seams, of which three have fair possi-
bilities. Considering its small size, it is
rather curious that the new Burnett railway
should have managed to accidentally run
through the middle of it. The top seam is
now being opened out and shows a sft. sec-
tion of fairly clean coal. Water-bore records
show up to 12 feet of coal in several seams,
but these have to be proved by shafts —
nobody knows definitely yet if the sections
are workable. It will be handy to supply
the railways thereabouts.

Austral Malay, the oldest of Australian
tin prospecting and development cos., has
announced the formation of Pungali Tin,
Ltd., to work an area acquired and pros-
pected last year near Pungah, Siam. Capital
is £500,000 in £1 shares, of which Austral
Malay takes 100,000 f.-p’s.; 330,000 shares
will be offered for subscription, 80,000 of
them at par to the staff of Austral Malay
and 250.000 to Austral Malay shareholders
in the proportion of five shares for every
two held. The 903-acre area is estimated
to contain 53.240,000 c.y. averaging .83 tin-
oxide, giving 72 p.c. tin. Three electrically-
operated dredges are to be set to work.
* * * *
Takuapa Valley, floated by Malaya Tin
Corporation in 1920, has issued its 1926
accounts. Net profit for the year was
£42.000; four divs. of Is. each were paid,
leaving £30,304 to go forward. But this
includes £8750 premium on new shares which
ought never to have been brought into this
account. The tin-oxide return from 1,529,000
c.y. averaged .721 b., realising £166 per ton,
which is equivalent to £275 per ton for tin,
London. Working profit was £lO9 per ton.
Values averaged 12.82 d. and costs 4.4 d. Pay-
able ground at December 31 was estimated
at 32.000,000 yards. Average depth is 27
feet, and it is anticipated that the present
dredge and the new one, which is expected to
set in by the middle of next year, will take
at least 12 years to clean up the area. The
new dredge, like the 150,000-yards-per-month
plant now in operation, will be electrically-
driven and up to date; it will have a slightly
larger capacity than No. 1. Its cost has
induced the directors to cut out dividends
for the current year, but unless something
shocking happens they will patter in again
presently.

Ratrut Basin, a Siamese tin show, was
floated by Malaya Tin Cornoration, and regis-
tered in Sydney back in 1914. The co., which
has done well by its shareholders, is seeking
pastures new. These are at Sichon, in
Southern Siam, where a dredging area lias
been acquired estimated to contain 23,162,680
c.y. Boring results, according to general-
manager J. M. White, who is in charge also
of Takuapa, show 28oz. to the c.y. for sec-
tion A (5,082,000yd5.), 16oz. for section B 1
(9,034,666yd5.), and 12oz. for section B 2
(9,048,930yd5.). The old Ratrut dredge has
a capacity of 80,000 c.y. per month, and
has been fitted with jigs and classifiers. It
will be dismantled and removed to Sichon.
There it will be supplemented by a modern
Diesel-electric dredge digging 150,000yds. a
month. Built by Poole and Steel of Sydney,
it is expected to be working by October, 1928,
Ratrut itself showed a loss of £2450 for 1926.
Four dividends of 6d. during the year
absorbed £12,551, and after deducting the
loss, a credit balance of £2514 remains. The-
co.’s original capital of £125,000 has been
increased to £250,000 to meet the equipment
of the new Sichon area. Of the new shares,
54,487 f.p.’s were allotted to the vendors of
the Sichon property, with £11,666 in cash.
Fifty thousand contribs. were offered to
shareholders at a ss. premium, and 20,000
were subscribed by the vendors. Directors
hope to continue the 6d. quarterly.

Malay Siamese Prospecting has issued a
progress report on its four offspring, Pliiu
Soon, Nawng Pet, Huey Yot and Ilaad Yai.
I*. Soon is an open-cut mine in the Kinta
(F.M.S.) district, long worked by Chinese.
After the co. arrived the area was worked
by gravel pumps with steam and electric
power. Drastic changes in management and
mine equipment were found necessary. A
pilot plant is to be installed to give the
new management an idea of what will really
be needed. This pilot plant, which is to
be ready in August, will cost about £7500
and a complete plant will run into £23,916.
Obviously, a lot of time must elapse before
these matters are finalised. The March
sampling of the working face went 5.401 b.
tin-oxide to the c.y., but only 3.861 b. was
recovered. In March and April 40,167 c.y.
yielded 41.72 tons, and with the pilot plant
a profit of Is. 3d. a yard is hoped for. The
outlook is thus far .indefinite.
Nawng Pet, a big hydraulic sluicing con-
cern near Ronpibon. in S. Siam, was troubled
in December last by floods which wrecked
dams and covered some of the faces with
25 feet of rubbish, and another flood in Janu-
ary damaged the mine. A proposal to divert
the stream is being considered, and share-
holders will be asked about the £30,000 it
will cost. Electrically-driven gravel pumps
are to be installed in conjunction with the
elevators, and a greatly-increased yardage
is expected. Here, too, apparently a lot of
money will have to be spent to get things
ship-shape. The co. has paid five dividends
—the last in April, 1925.
Huey Yot. a dredging show in Southern
Siam, has also been worked by Chinese for
years. Originally a “dollar” co., it was
reconstructed in 1925 and capital increased
and converted to £140.000 in £1 shares. Of
these, 70,000 are ordinaries and 70,000 12
p.c. prefs. The total area held is 834 acres.
Boring returns vary, an average estimate
being 1.331 b. The Werf Conrad bucket-
dredge should be erected by December. After
that the conversion of the co.’s suction-cutter
dredge to a bucket plant will be taken in
hand.
Haad Yai is another tin-dredging area in
S. Siam. There was a rather violent differ-
ence between boring tests on this property,
and the truth is not made clear in the present
report. Perhaps the new bucket-dredge,
begun in March, will have to settle the
dispute.

New Guinea Gold and Osmiridium, which
sought the far-off fields of London when it
came to floating a co. to develop its New
Guinea properties, announces that its repre-
sentative, IT. W. Clark, lias fixed up a
flotation, to be called New Guinea Goldfields
Exploration, with a capital of £75,000. The
only details made public before Clark left
in March were that several leases had been
secured on the Bulolo, next to Guinea
Gold’s holdings, and another on Wau Creek.
History is dumb on the results of tests, if
any, but London underwriters are reported
to have guaranteed the issue. It is worth
noting that, though osmiridium has been
found in Papua, no reports have yet reached
Australia of its occurrence in the Bulolo-
Edie Creek country.
:J; * * *
Guinea Gold, the most convincing of the
cos. out to exploit the Bulolo country, has
issued a statement of its position. A nomi-
nal profit of £664 is shown by deducting
expenses from the value of gold produced.
No serious estimate can be arrived at, how-
ever. till the sluicing plant comes into regu-
lar operation, and the directors ask for
patience in this regard. The co.’s ’plane
service from the coast has eased the many
difficulties. Paid capital was £26,993, and
a new share issue at a premium of £1
brought in £9918 new money. Matters may
be said to be satisfactory, since liabilities
are small. The co., however, suffers, like
most of these New Guinea propositions, from
the fact that the public lias yet to learn
exact values and working costs.

A man who had his head inside a shark’s
mouth and got away alive was the abo. diver
Treacle, Avho died lately in the Far North.
The shark tackled him under water, and
although its teeth
were fastened in
his neck Treacle
fought like a mani-
ac. Feeling for the
shark’s eyes, he got
his thumb in them
and gouged with all
his strength, until
the big fisli had had
enough. Treacle
was patched up in
Thursday Island
hospital.
R. L. BUTLER, of South Australia, now
Australia’s only non-Labor State Premier.
Tom Treble can lay the flattering unction
to his soul that N.S.W. Premier Lang was
so determined to give him a rise of £lOOO a
year that he sacked a Ministry and disrupted
a party in his zeal for a faithful lieutenant.
Treble, who is only 35, joined the Public Ser-
vice 18 years ago, armed with a certificate of
his ability to write Pitman’s shorthand at 180
words a minute. He got his first taste of the
inside of politics as private secretary to J.
C. L. Fitzpatrick when that gentleman was
Treasurer. Lang, as Treasurer to the Storey-
Pooley Cabinets, rescued him from the arid
job of official court reporter, and, as Premier,
made him private secretary and then assist-
ant to the Treasury at £B5O a year. His new
job as Child Endowment Commissioner
carries a screw of £lB5O. Treble is short but
athletic, and in his younger days won medals
for boxing and swimming. He has been
Lang’s leaning-post.
Bob Cruiekshank, New South Wales’s new
honorary Minister, must feel out of place
in the Lang galley. A pressman who dis-
covered that the advertising side of a papur
pays best, he was one of the leading spirits
of the White Australia movement in Queens-
land, and had no time for red-raggers. In
late years he has been advertising man for
the Sydney Worker, which isn’t a bit partial
to the Lang-Willis crowd.
Grandmaster Snowball, the choice of
Brighton, is again nibbling at the Vic.
Speakership, just as things were looking
well for Peacock for that job. But it will
probably suit Labor better to remove Alec
from the counsels of the Opposition, if he
can command support from his own side of
the House.
Denis Rook, who is trying to show that he.
really is a bird by making a solo flight from
the Old Dart to Australia, left the Royal Air
Force in India to become an Australian citi-
zen in 1921. He was in Perth for a time
and then went to North Westralia to start a
motor transport and mail launch business.
Land and water proved too tame, and he is
now out to make a big name for liimselr by
improving on C-obham’s achievements.
About the loneliest job in the gift of Stan-
ley Bruce is Administrator of Nauru, the ex-
German manure heap in the Pacific which
Britain and Maoriland now share with Aus-
tralia. The isolation vanquished Brig.-
General Griffiths, who has given up £l5OO
and quarters to return to the haunts of his
fellow men. His successor will be W. A. New-
man, chief clerk of the Defence Department.
Newman has clerked in various capacities for
N. S. Wales., Yic. and the Commonwealth for
close on 40 years. As assistant to secretary
Trumble he carried a fair burden of the
Defence business during the European
struggle.
A clarion call to Australian Jewry to help
the Zionist cause is being sounded, with
Dr. Alexander Goldstein operating the bugle.
Goldstein is a Russian lawyer who became a
journalist, and was in politics for a brief
period in 1917. Slight in build, but an
earnest exhorter, he raised £l5OO in a few
days from the small Jewish community of
Brisbane.
George Laffer is the ,12th Speaker the
S.A. Assembly has had since the first, G.
S. Kingston, walked up to the dais in 1857.
Jenkin Coles stopped in the chair for 21
years, but recently there have been quick
changes; Laffer is the third since Jim Mc-
Innes was appointed in July, 1924. Laffer
was born in the State and has been in
Parliament for 14 years. He had a portfolio
under Barwell.
Bernard Smith, who died in Queensland
recently, was a conspicuous figure in Gympie
when that great goldfield was in its prime.
Manager of more than one of the big mines.
Smith will be best remembered for his long
association with the famous North Smith-
field. Farming occupied his latter years till
the end came at 73.
Tom Johnson, ex-N.S.W. railway chief, is
re-visiting- Australia. He had a unique record
as a strike-breaker. The Sydney tram strike
of 1908 started in a business-like way, and
the service was tied up from the word “go.”
But Johnson went along to a mass meeting
of the men at the Centenary Hall, and offered
forgiveness to all who came back on the
job immediately, and the rest of it was
merely a scramble to be first to sign on.
“He called ’em naughty boys and they
rushed back crying,” said one of the leaders
disgustedly.
Of the 12 members of the defunct Allan
Ministry (Vic.) Allan, Peacock, Argyle,
Downward and Goudie are entitled to life-
passes on all the Australian railways. A
Premier gets the concession after one year's
service and Ministers after three years’
service. All exSMinisters of Vic. receive
passes for life on the State lines. The ex-
tension to Australian lines was made by a
Premiers’ conference.
Tommy Dodds, the Ma State’s new Base
Commandant, is a Northumbrian who began
his Australian career in Queensland as a
schoolteacher, and climbed from the rank
of full private in the long-defunct State
Teachers’ Corps to his present status of
Brigadier-General, with S. African and Big
War decorations, C.M.G. and C.V.O. At the
time of the Armistice he was Commandant,
Australian H.Q., London. After his return
to Australia he was commandant in West-
ralia and military secretary in Melbourne
till his translation to London as military
representative of the Commonwealth on the
Imperial General Staff. He once won a
Tatt.’s sweep.
D. C. Bates, who has been Maoriland’s
official weather prophet for close on a quar-
ter of a century, is retiring as a result of
reorganisation of the meteorological office.
The cheery little gentleman started as an
Anglican parson and had a parish in N.S.W.
once upon a time. He was padre of one
of the M.L. contingents in S. Africa; after
that he resigned from the ministry on
grounds of health, later joining the meteoro-
logical staff at Wellington (M.L.). Farmers
valued his forecasts and had a grudge against
the Government for stinting his department
of equipment. Bates takes a great interest
in zoology, and it was mainly through him
that the Wellington Zoo w r as established.
There was many a regretful sigh from old
boys of St. Aloysius’ College (Sydney) when
Thomas McGrath, affectionately known to
two generations as “Cliook,” reported to Igna-
tius Loyola at 86. Dublin-born, he entered
the Society of Jesus in 1867, and was study-
ing in Amiens when the Franco-Prussian
war sent him back to England and then to
Australia. He taught at St. Aloysius’, first
in Bourke-street, Surry Hills (N.S.W.), and
latterly at Milson’s Point.
Jones, Minister for Public Works, who
has been a successful clothing manufacturer,
is the wealthiest member of Vic. Labor Min-
istry. Beckett, Disney and Williams are
also more than comfortable.
Almost every Australian newspaper that
referred to the
political inter-
lude in pianist
P a d e r e w ski’s
career spoke of
him as having
been President
of Poland. The
“ Window of
Europe” has had
three presidents
since it re-
emerged into
nationhood, and'
Pad. wasn’t one
of the m. He
was, however,
Prime Minister
for a troublous
term. There is
no mention of
Pad.’s debut as
a statesman in
recent books of
reference, which
would seem to
indicate that he
wishes the busi-
n es s forgotten
and desires to
be remembered
only as a vir-
tuoso.
ARTHUR
GARRETS,
U.S. Consul,
Melbourne.
The decision of the Australian Hibernian
Society to raise a statue of Cardinal Moran
in St. Mary’s Cathedral (Sydney) is largely
the result of the sustained efforts of Denis
Francis O’Haran, Chaplain-General to the
society. The statue is to be nine feet high
and is to cost £3000; Bertram Mackennal will
do the job in London. Moran did a lot for
O’Haran, and in a public utterance once
referred to him as “a unit of myself.” Nowa-
days, at 70, O’Haran is priest of the parish
of the Sacred Heart, at Darlinghurst.
Dr. Robertson, chairman of Vic. Board of
Public Health and permanent head of the
Health Department, leaves by the Ventura
on July 2 to have a look at the medical insti-
tutions of Yankeedom. Leave of absence
has been arranged by the State Government,
and exes, will be paid by the Rockefeller
Foundation, which has money to burn. It is
Robertson’s first trip abroad since he joined
the Health Department 25 years ago.
A family long rooted in N. S. Wales lost a
notable representative when Henry Luke
White, better known as “Belltrees,” after the
family homestead, died suddenly on Monday.
Grandfather White came out as sheepmaster
for the Australian Agricultural Company,
settled on the land, and prospered exceed-
ingly. “Belltrees” White was one of Aus-
tralia’s most notable bird-lovers ; his priceless
collection of specimens went to the Mel-
bourne National Museum. He established a
sanctuary for native birds and beasts at
Belltrees; also he financed Centralian
explorers; bred and raced horses; was a
generous giver and host; and as a philatelist
was known throughout the world. He left
a stamp collection of enormous value to the
Mitchell Library. White passed his sixty-
seventh milestone just three weeks before the
end.
W. J. Code, chairman of Vic. Forests
Commission, is to retire at the end of this
year. His present term, which expires on
June 30, will be extended till September 30.
and then he will be given three months'
leave of absence in recognition of 41 years'
work. During the next seven months Beckett,
the new Minister for Forests, will endeavor
to find a successor, in Australia, if possible.
Melbourne will lose many a picturesque
item in its daily news when Hai-rie B. Lee
resigns the job of fire chief. The stocky
fellow has a fair share of egotism and has
no objection to posing for his photograph
before a blazing building. But ordinary citi-
zens are grateful for his outspoken com-
ments when an outbreak reveals another
ancient death-trap. He has been saving Mel-
bourne from itself for over 20 years.
There lies at rest on Yule Island, New
Guinea, a priest, Father Bourjade, who was
not always a man of peace. In the Big Scrap
he was one of France’s aces, and was deco-
rated with the blue ribbon of the Legion d'
Honnetir. When blackwater fever struck him
down he was endeavoring to get a baby
'plane, so that he could fly to Thursday
Island for mails and stores and make trips
to mission stations. A party landed from
a French warship to pay a last tribute to
a gallant comrade-in-arms.
Hogan, the new Labor Premier of Vic.,
will receive £1551 a year and the other seven
salaried Ministers £1207 each. Allan drew
£1450, Peacock £1350 and the other six of
that team £l2OO each. Ministers are not
paid as M.P’s., and honoraries and whips
have to be recompensed out of their salaried
colleagues’ portions. Lawson hadn’t to pay
anything to wealthy honoraries like Baillieu
and Mackinnon.
A history of coaching in Australia and
Maoriland will see the light one of these days.
It is being compiled by E. M. Lovell-Smith,
of Christchurch, a waiter, printer and water-
colorist, who many years ago foresaw the
disappearance of the romantic forms of
transport and started making careful- paint-
ings of all the famous coaches that rolled
through his home town. The old coaches
in their heyday were not to be despised,
either for comfort or capacity. Slung on
leather thorough-braces some of them could
hold 40 to 60 passengers. The Leviathan,
which ran between Ballarat and Geelong,
was licensed to carry 75.
The most picturesque figure in Maoriland
Labor circles is Bob Semple, w T lio has been
elected chairman of the party this year. He
was born in N.S.W. 54 years ago. and spent
the first years of his working life on gold-
fields in various States. Crossing the Tas-
man, he became a coalminer and helped to
form the first Miners’ Federation, out of
which the famous Red Fed. developed. The
waterside workers’ strike of 1913 had Bob's
earnest attention. He did a stretch in gaol
for that, being released on a bond of £2OOO.
He had a term as M.P. for Wellington at the
close of the w-ar, and then faded out of poli-
tics and agitation to lead the co-operative
party that cut the capital’s long Oronorongo
tunnel, which was pushed through in Aus-
tralasian record time. A hard worker with
pick, pen or tongue, he commands respect
from any audience. The only time he didn't
get it was when, addressing a big city meeting,
lie opened up by saying: “I am a stranger to
most of you in this vast crow r d to-night."
Whereupon a little man w 7 ith a high, piercing
voice remarked “So am I.”
A dramatic episode in Repat. history is
recalled by the cabled report of the marriage
of L. St. C. Grondona, shortened to “Gron"
when he w T as chief clerk at Sydney Repat.,
to the sister of A. E. Hyland, director of
Australian trade publicity in Britain. “Gron”
had a war with a Sydney newspaper over
its aspersions on the conduct of Repat.;
and being refused the right of reply to some
of the paper’s assertions he called upon the
Repat. staff to strike a levy to pay for the
publication of his retort, at advertising rates,
in the Sydney morning papers. The Repat.
Commission did not approve of his methods,
but “Gron” got timely warning and his
M. GUYON, Governor of New Caledonia.
resignation was in before the notice of his
suspension came to hand from Melbourne.
Within a week he had a broadsheet on the
streets in which he smote Repat. critics hip
and thigh. A public that likes a fight bought
the paper widely at threepence a copy. Then
“Gron” went to London, where he became
a sort of unoffibial-though-officially-recogmsed
immigration agent. He lias written books
and pamphlets on Australia, and looks alter
The Bulletin’s London business. He trod
the Inky Way before he went to the war.
THE POLITICAL PLATYPUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. McTiernan is a shining example of the old
proverb that there is no rage like the rage of a
sheep. Having been wet-nursed by Mr. Lang as a
political fledgling, and having done some years
apprenticeship at the old practice of walking on eggs
without fracturing a shell, the ex-Attorney-General
now appears in a role suggesting that he has lately
been nourished on the venom of a squid.” Labou
Daily.
He’s a beast and a bird and a fish.
In fact, there is no one to link us
So surely as he,
Aloysius McT.,
With Platypus ornithorynchus.
And he’s turned with beak, talon and fang,
With horn and with hoof upon Lang.
Hear him bleat like a bellicose sheep!
Hear him coo, with malignance infernal,
Like a young sucking dove
111-repaying the love
And the milk that was semi-maternal!
Queer fare for a squid, you may say,
But what else does the image convey ?
He’s ovine and avian to boot.
And human, if only in erring;
He’s flesh, so to say,
And fowl, in a way,
And red —no, lie’s anti-Red herring.
While on eggs he can tip-toe, as well

He’s a beast, with a bloodthirsty baa.

With deadly effects
In the arm of the fellow who s fed it.

twisted a joggle for his bullock-yoke, “but

“Wjngella” (N.T.) : Everyone who has
crossed nibs with me over the question of
immunity from malaria has wandered from
the point. I asked whether there is a natu-
ral immunity from fever in some people's
systems, and, if so, whether they would not
be the right type for settling in fever-
haunted districts. I know of folk who never
bother about rigging mosquito-nets unless the
mosquitoes are beyond all bearing; people
who can camp out at all times of the year
never use quinine or aspirin, and do not
know what malaria is. One of these fellows
never takes sugar in anything, nor does he
Care for salt, nor do mosquitoes worry him

quite unconscious of their biting, until his
attention was called to them. lie believes
that quite half the malarial attacks are due
to sheer funk, persons worrying themselves
into a high fever every time they get an
ache in a little finger. Anyway, there must
be some reason why a child in one home
suffers two or three times a week from re-
curring attacks of malaria, whilst the child
next door never gets] an attack, though
equally exposed to infection by anopheles.

“Louis Gunn” : An interesting relic of the
early days is lying on a farm in the Boralma
(Vic.) district. It is believed to be the
first multi-furrow plough made in Australia,
having been built in Wangaratta about 65
years ago. Except that it is much more
massive, the implement is practically the
same in design as many ploughs being made
here to-day. It has three furrows, their
depth being regulated by side levers, and
was originally made for draught by bullocks.
To prove that history begins to repeat it,::; 1 !
and then thinks better (or worse) of it,
the manufacturer was William Morris
Hughes.
“FY7”: Something new in Australian
droving comes from Queensland, where 9000
bullocks. are to be shifted from Brunette
Downs m the western N.J\ to southern
Queensland, \vhere they will be topped. Ihe

lot were, originally, to have been brought
on the hoof down the famous old droving
route from Camooweal to the south along
the W.Q. river systems, but extra-dry con-
ditions made this dangerous. The cattle will
now travel on the hoof from Brunette Downs
to the railhead at Cloncurry about 250
miles. There, special trains will take them
across Queensland to the coast at Towns-
ville, the best part of 500 miles. Then
another 700 miles down the coast to Bris-
bane, with yet another 50 miles or there-
abouts inland again to the paddocks at
Grandchester, on the Brisbane-Toowoomba
line. Nothing of. the kind has ever been
tried in this country before, and if the ex-
periment proves a success in satisfactory
transport and cost, it may mark a revolu-
tionary change.
si: :i: *
“Bidgee” : An old dingo bitch is shrewder
than any fox. Reynard depends almost
entirely on his keen scent, and neither sight
nor hearing is developed to the same extent
as in the dingo. I have stalked foxes in
fairly open country, and with the wind in
the right direction have often been successful
in getting a shot, but have never managed to
bag a dingo in this way. Approaching a
dam or tank a fox usually comes straight
in, but the dingo almost invariably circles
water and approaches upwind. The fox is
easy to poison and will take almost any
bait that has not been handled, but the
dingo often ignores even the daintiest and
most carefully-placed morsel. A fox will
follow a trail at any time, and if traps
are set and the trail drawn over them a
catch is fairly sure.
:!: :!: *
“Jim Carew”: It is a false assumption
of “Jan Van Esse” (B. 5/5/’27) that the
tree-fern throws out at most two sets of
leaves from the crown each year. Early
last November I brought two tree-fern
trunks from the N.S.W. south coast to a
Sydney garden. Since then each has thrown
out three complete sets of leaves. It is
impossible to correctly gauge a tree-fern’s
age from the height of its trunk or by the
number of frond marks on it. Under
ideal conditions I have known the trunk of
a tree-fern to grow 18 inches in a year.
In dry times I have seen it take three
years to grow nine inches.
* * * *
. “Bihai”: Round Mt. Yule, in Papua, the
natives have a unique method of making
fishing-nets from spiders’ web. The particu-
lar spider that spins the web used is of
a queer shape, not unlike a crab, measures
about an inch across the body and at each
side has a horny spike. Its color is greyish-
white and yellow, and the web it weaves
very strong and sticky. Natives bring any
of these spiders they find to the village and
toss them into the surrounding bushes, where
their nets are so thick that even birds are
sometimes caught in them. Desiring a net,
a native searches out a suitable shrub with
a straight stem and two even branches;
these are stripped of leaves, cut into the
desired length and bound together at the
top, making a rough oval some two feet
long by 18 inches across. Spiders are placed
on the top, and in time covei the oval with
a mat of their webs. If a net is required
in a hurry, the trimmed wood is plunged
into masses of already spun webs and
twirled round until a sufficient strength is
reached. In the mountain creeks there are
no large fish, and the nets, which are similar
to our landing-nets, easily hold fish up to
nine or ten inches in length. To test their
strength, a 21b. tin of bullamacow was drop-
ped into one of these nets from a height of
six feet, and just bounced out. A visiting
entomologist gave £5 for one which had been
brought to the coast, and stated that the
British Museum would not cavil at paying
him double the price.
$ * * *
“Harry J.”: I recently saw a fox out-
witted by a wedge-tailed eagle. The eagle
had made a splendid swoop to the water and
secured a fair-sized Prussian carp. lie
took it to a waterside clearing and began
his breakfast. So swift was the dash of a
fox from the near-by bushes that the bird
missed the snap of his jaws by inches only.
The intruder appeared to be more interested
in the carp as bait than as provender, for,
after nosing it over for a few seconds, lie
slunk back to cover. The eagle then re-
turned, alighting on the edge of the clearing
furthest from the fox’s ambush, and walk'd
warily towards the fish. His final sprint,
the grasping of the carp, the uplifting spread
and sweep of his wings seemed to occupy
less than a second. The fox was fuddled
completely. He walked dejectedly into the
open, sniffed at the fishy spot, squinted at
the soaring wedgetail, and finally trotted off.
* * * *
“S.C.”: I struck a reef-heron the other
day in coloring a light slate-grey; as a rule,
this fond is attired in sooty black. At full-
moon tides, when the water recedes to a
great distance, the reef-hei-ons may be seen
far out among the rock-fowls picking up
small crabs, marine worms and small shell-
fish. An attenuated and elongated worm,
reddish in color, which homes in clumps of
cungevoi, is a favorite item in these birds’
menu. They are a silent lot on the whole,
but occasionally give vent to a harsh, croak-
ing call.

striking distance. The smell would wake her
up.

KURRAJONGS AND SUGAR-GUMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The land has cast its summer robes,
,Cool autumn comes again;
The wheat-fields lie a-fallowing
And bare are hill and plain.
A laggard swallow skims the pool
Where ibis strut serene,
And by the roads the sugar-gums
And kurrajongs are green.
Dust-coated are the homestead roofs
That nestle by the way,
Their humble hedges nibbled low
Where hungry cattle stray.
The cypress-pine is grey and gaunt
In nipping winds and keen.
But stately rows of sugar-gums
And kurrajongs are green. .
The wattle’s fronds' are red with dust
That from the roads is blown,
And moss is spreading on the rails
Where shadows have been thrown.
The myall bows a drooping head,
Its leaves have lost their sheen,
But by the road the sugar-gums
And kurrajongs are green.
The lofty poplar's limbs are bare,
And grey as tarnished lead ;
The orchard-trees have donned a garb
Of yellow, brown and red;
The spindly stubble bends and breaks
Where harvests have been lean,
Yet through the fence the kurrajongs
And sugar-gums are green.
Through summer’s heat and winter’s chill,
When drought is at its worst,
When river, dam and creek are dry,
And bush things die of thirst,
And even when the raging fires
Have swept the pastures clean,
The shady clumps of sugar-gums
And kurrajongs are green.

“Gouger”: Nature forces the baby turtle
to fight a fierce battle for existence. Before
he is hatched he runs the gauntlet of goannas,
dingoes, wild pigs, white wanderers, aborigi-
nals and all the colored crews of the shell
and beche-de-mer fleets. And when, with
hundreds of his kind, he toils up out of his
sandy birthplace, and, joining what looks
like an army of small crabs, makes for the
seeming shelter of the water, the odds
against his surviving to a green old age are
100 to 1. Just above the sand screech a
ravening host of birds, sea-hawks and eagles
buffeting wings amongst the smaller fowl in
a catch-as-catch-can race against time. Some
of the turtlets, instinct at white heat even
a few moments after birth, seek sanctuary
beside a handy shell what time the winged
fiends chase their scurrying comrades to the
water. A greatly-diminished army tears into
the sea, there to be met by water-streaked
ripples which denote sharks and stingrays.
If, luckily, there are floating bunches of sea-
weed handy, some of the babies gain a hiding-
place. What are left of the others dive
and streak back for the shore, their tiny
heads peeping above water just where the
wavelets hit the sand, ready instantly to
dart into the water or out on the wet sand

as the exigencies of the situation between
finny and feathered foe demand. The cloak

from prowling dingoes, hawks, tiger-cats and
other marauders, and thus for a few weeks

Finally, the fittest that have survived grow

can defy even sharks, though occasionally
they lose a protruding flipper. Then comes a
long life of travel, provided they dodge
the ever-ready harpoon of man. The old-
man turtle, with seaweed and shell-fish grow-
ing to his back, would provide material for
volumes of thrilling romance if his history
could be written from birth.

“Sebrof” : I once took a job of ploughing
for a farmer on the coast near Torquay
(Vic.). Everything was right except the
evening meal, which was known locally as
“fisherman’s luck”; it consisted of what-
ever the cocky’s family succeeded in catching
from the waters of the brackish creek or
the adjacent ocean. For the first eight nights
we had mullet, snapper, mullet again, limpets
en casserole, cray, mullet again, more snap-
per and mussels au gratin. On the ninth
night the bill-of-fare was boiled seagull. I
didn’t wait for the dish of the following
evening.
“Eureka”: If “Bill R.” (B. 5/5/’27) is
serious when lie states that the rabbit pest
has been eliminated from the N.S.W. south-
ern tablelands, either he has never been in
the district or when there was blind. The
freezers' at Bombala, Nimmitabel, Jindabyne,
Cooma and Bungeridore have been closed, not
for want of rabbits but because of industrial
and commercial trouble and a declining mar-
ket. There are enough rabbits there and on
the far South Coast to keep a dozen works
going. Trappers found that they got a bet-
ter deal from the skin buyers, and trapped
(and poisoned) for the wrappers. A rabbit-
canning factory at Wyndham, on the South
Coast, commenced operations a few years
ago, and turned out a first-class article, but
had to close down. Rabbits now live under
the factory buildings and swarm in the sur-
rounding country.
* * * *
“Crosshead”: The gum-tree described by
“Simon” (B. 5./5/’27) knew what it was
doing when it sent its two-inch root below
70 feet. At depth from the surface there is
a region where the rock interstices are
always water-laden. The depth depends on
climate, nature of soil or rock and elevation
above sea-level. Roots sent down to this
level (known as the “water-table”) would
nurture the tree during most dry spells in-
dependently of surface moisture, a circum-
stance which explains the amazing greenness
of some of our native trees in regions of lean
rainfall. The fact that the root went through
a cave —itself the result of the action of
water —supports my idea of it.
* * * *
“Bobette”: The flounder, according to
“Jesmond” (B. 28/4/’27), can often be
caught with a spear just after sunset. There
is, however, a better chance of capturing a
few after dark, with the aid of a lantern,
The light, if held just above the wmter,
attracts the fish. . They, remain almost
stationary within its radius, and may be
easily caught by anyone at all expert at the
game. On calm dark nights along various
reaches of the Manukau Harbor (M.L.), and
no doubt elsewhere, it is a common thing
to see many lanterns dotting the black
waters where silent fishermen are getting a
double service from their gum spears.

“Momokeni”: Recently a 14ft. alligator
snatched a native woman from one of the
Gulf villages in Papua. Two days later the
’gator was killed, and the villagers, on dis-
embowelling him, found the woman inside,
quite whole, with not even the skin torn, a
few rows of indentations only showing where
the teeth had grasped her. But in color she
was a greyish-white. All the brown skin
pigment had been bleached away by the
uigestive juices of the alligator’s stomach.

“Eureka”: Bushmen have been known to
use all kinds of berry juices for writing pur-
poses (B. 5/5/’27), but a Bombala
(N.S.W.) rabbiter’s ink beats all. He
drained enough blood from a rabbit to write
to the township for his week’s supply of
stores to be sent out with the mailman.
Included in the order was a bottle of ink.
The storekeeper, thinking that the man pre-
ferred red ink, sent out a bottle of that
color. Some time later the rabbiter, being
in town, asked the storekeeper w 7 hy he had
sent red ink. “Think that I was a bloomin’
Bolshie?” The storekeeper explained.
“Blime, didn’t you know that was rabbit’s
blood?” the bunny-hunter said.. The store-
keeper, a vegetarian and a member of the
R.S.P.C.A., sent him a free supply of black
ink after that in case he should run short
again.
* ■ * . * ■*
“Ivobbi” : The cliico, the Californian coch-
ineal insect for the prickly-pear, is now
not without a rival. This keen competitor
is a green worm which attains to silkworm
size. It is hatched from one of some bO
or so tiny eggs laid on the leaf-surface by
a little grey moth. Boring immediately on
birth into its green bed it proceeds to eat
the vitals out of the leaf. Outwardly there
is little or no sign of its activities, but if
the leaf is held up to the light, the X-ray
picture of 30 or 40 worms eating ravenously
is disclosed. And the job is thoroughly done.
Another effective unit in the army of assault
is a tiny red spider which spins its web
over each of the “eyes” of the pear-leaf,
causing it to sicken and eventually killing
the clump.

“AdeL.” : One sees strangely-built houses
in the North. South of the Barkly table-
land some are constructed of a kind of
stunted canegrass—pleasantly habitable
these. In the North-West mud houses thatched
with rushes are not uncommon. Ti-tree
bark is extensively used in the Gulf country
and the Peninsula by both aborigines and
whites. Bark is the favorite material for
gunyahs, and the white makes a fairly com-
fortable home out of the same material. On
the shore of the Gulf grows a species of
melaleuca, huge trees from which natives
cut sheets of bark as large as 12ft. x 6ft.,
pliable and waterproof, and in strength
almost equal to galvanised-iron. With this
material cheap and cool homes of comfort-
able sizes can be easily erected. From a kind
of rush growing abundantly about rivers
and swamps—it is locally known as blade-
grass—delightfully cool dwellings can also
be built by overlapping each row of rushes
on battens, with straight walls to any height
liked, and a pitched roof. Such houses are
weather-proof and resist the severe tropical
gales.
* * * *
“Crosshead” : The plaster of red-lead and
tar advocated by “Elgar” (B. 5/5/’27) will
not stop the leak in an oil tank. Let him
trv a putty composed of litharge and glycer-
ine along the leaky joints, previously
cleaned, and his troubles will be at an end.
Incidentally, this oil-resisting cement saved the
fortunes of several Australian manufacturers
making petrol pumps in a small way. Their
first machines, though sound in design, could
not be made petrol-tight at the joints until
the worried manufacturers tried this dodge,
till then a trade secret. Shellac and fuller’s
earth have also been recommended. But I
cannot vouch for them from personal experi-
ence.
* * * *
“Tongio West”: How do sea-birds sleep?
Sailor friends of mine differ on this point.
One old salt says he often noted, when
passing the Cape on bright moonlight nights,
hundreds of petrels and other birds sleeping
on the water so soundly that they never
rose when the ship passed among them.
* * *
“Bihai”: When Captain Carver took
H.M.S. Torch on her last trip round the
Islands, a shooting-party landed on Guadal-
canar in the Solomons. While one of the
number was standing under a tree, another,
a little in the rear, saw an animal crouched
on a limb and evidently preparing to spring
on the man underneath. He fired and brought
down something of the cat tribe. It
measured 4ft. 6in. from tip to tip, and was
of a tabby color with large dark spots. None
of the party was sufficiently versed in
natural history to place it as a species of
leopard or merely a monster wild cat, but
tiie general opinion favored the former idea.
Has anyone ever heard of a similar animal
in the islands?
BILL SAYS—
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
•Some add so much to the tales they tell
that, try as a fellow will,
He hasn't an earthly chance to get at the
• guts of the thing,” said Bill.
“Some blokes will shove in an extra lie for
the sake of the laugh it brings;
But give me the man who will stick to facts
when he gives you the strong of things.
“Give me the man who will say what’s what,
so that a fellow can know
Where he gets on, and where he gets off, and
liow t far it’s safe to go.
It may seem clever to kid the mob with a
bit of your own, but there
Is something solid about the chap who
handles his facts with care.
“We are most of us built in a style that we
can lie without much fuss,
Rut it hurts a bit when some bloke comes
in with a stupid lie to us.
And it hurts the more that we most of us
have fallen so far from grace
That times will come when the truth must
go and a falsehood take its place.
“We are most of us liars, some more, some
less, and I’ve done my share,” said Bill.
“I've shoved in a lie or two myself when I
thought it would please them, still
There’s a bloke I hate with ajiate that takes
in the whole of his peuigree,
I reckon him downright over the odds —the
chap who would lie to me.”

GREEN OATS FOR ENSILAGE.
“C.J.H.”: “Ziff” (B. 5/5/’27) interests
me very much when he advocates the stack-
ing of grain on a mouse-proof platform as
the best way of providing for droughts. If
he had cut his oats before the grain
appeared, placed them straightway in an
excavated earthen tank and covered them
with six feet of dirt, he would have had
feed for far more stock and eliminated many
risks.
Oats cut while the nutritive contents are
evenly distributed throughout the stalks, i.e.,
just before the grain appears, make the finest
silage; but. to secure the best results and
retain all the nutritive gases and fats, they
should be pitted in dry ground, with at least
six feet of earth between them and the air.
For pit-silage no expensive machinery is re-
quired ; it is safe from rain, fire, flood, birds,
mice, etc., for 20 years or more, and insur-
ance is unnecessary. The pit can be exca-
vated like a tank for Is. per cubic yard,
preferably in the middle of the paddock, and
the mushy green stuff filled in with a slide.
In the absence of a reaper and binder, any
old mower and horse-rake will do. The
horses should tramp right through the silage,
tightening it until it attains a height of 4ft.
above ground-level; then earth should be
scooped over until a thickness of six feet
has been secured; by that time the silage
will have ceased to subside and the resulting
mound can be rounded off to turn the rain.
When silage is conserved in this manner
about 24 cubic yards of excavation should
be allowed to the ton. Preferably the pit
should not be opened for a year. To feed
from it, scoop off the overburden and with
the help of a sharp axe and crowbar take
the silage out in blocks about 2in. x
20in. x 20in. These blocks can be
pulled to pieces by stock after having been
exposed to the air for an hour or two.
hour pounds of this silage per head per
diem is a full fattening ration for a sheep,
or is sufficient for a ewe and her lamb.
Make a little calculation based on the fol-
lowing data: Oaten hay when cured and
stacked loses five-sixths of its weight, and
nearly all the loss is represented by valu-
able fats and gases. Thus, take 100 acres
of ordinary crop (14 tons of hay or 20
bushels of grain per acre) ;
(1) As silage properly conserved it would
yield 2,016.0001 b; that is, feed for 1000
ewes for 504 days at 41b. per head per diem.
(2) As chaff 336.0001 b., i.e., feed for 1000
ewes for 168 days at 21b. per head.
(3) As grain 80.0001 b.. or feed for 1000
ewes for 80 days at 11b. per head.
If the above rations were halved they
would keep sheep alive through a drought.
OATS FOR DROUGHT FODDER.
“P.H.P.”; I agree with “Ziff” (B.
5/5/’27) that oats are the best fodder for
drought feed, and cheaper to grow and keep
than any other.
To get a good crop of wheat these days
it must be sown on fallow, whereas an excel-
lent crops of oats can be grown on stubble
ground; and besides offering the advantage
of a second crop from the one fallowing, the
oats are a good way of getting rid of flag
smut. Especially on clay ground they grow
heavily—usually much more per acre than
wheat. Although costing the same to cut,
stook and stack as wheaten hay, oaten hay
comes out cheaper, as a horse is satisfied
with less and seems to work better on it.
It is, moreover, easier to handle than wheat,
as it is so much softer.
Should an oaten crop be stripped for
grain, and the grain be stacked as drought
or winter feed, it must be raised to a
mouse-proof bench. Not as “Ziff” suggests,
with a few posts sunk in the ground and
kerosene tins slipped over, but with good
solid posts and a piece of flat iron put on
top, and then the cross-pieces for the bench
on top again. The flat iron must have 9
inches clearance from the edge of the post.
A kerosene tin is only 9|in. across. When
a 7-incli post is inside that, it leaves only 11
inches each side of the post. I have seen
mice three or four thick on a post, which
means that the outside mouse could easily reach
the outside of such a tin. After the tin has
been in the weather a little while it rusts, and
the mice then find a way up. Oats are too
valuable to be thus risked. So buy some
sheet-iron and make a job of it.
THE BEST DROUGHT-FODDER?
“Dougle”: .On the fodder-conservation
question, while I agree that grain-oats are
normally the best and most economical fod-
der to store, I differ with “Ziff” in regard
to “bulk in fodder” being last year’s idea.
All animals, humans included, require a
bulk of fodder to be eaten before the intes-
tines and especially the lower bowels func-
tion correctly. This is even more necessary
in animals that chew their cud (four-
stomach) than in the one-stomach species.
By bulk one does not necessarily mean quan-
tity, but rather fibre or, as the Yanks term
it, “roughage.” The craze to-day in humans
is for wliole-meal bread, bran cakes, etc.
Apart from the vitamine content, the chief
value of this type of food lies in its bulk
(roughage).
Everybody who has had drought experi-
ence knows the ill-effect of concentrates
alone, such as boiled wheat. The ehief danger
lies in the fact that there is no bulk, but
rather a nutritious, sloppy mass in the in-
testines that does not encourage the working
of the abdominal muscles. Grain-oats when
compared with wheat and maize are rather
poor in actual food value. Their real value
lies in the large percentage of horny husk
to grain as against any other form of con-
centrate. Thus the proportion of roughage
is high ; hence the intestines of stock feeding
on this fodder have a bulk to work on with
better results all round.
It is well known that sheep if once filled
with bulky fodder will travel on poor pick-
ing for weeks, merely because the intestines
are working and the animals get that full
feeling. I have personally fed sheep for
months on straw sprayed with weak molasses.
If the salts are kept up the stock do com-
paratively well on this, although there is
practically no food value in it.
Apart from the food values given for grain-
oats, the high yield per acre and low market
value should make this commodity the ideal
stock-fodder to store. Incidentally, the right
type of lucerne-hay, which is a fairly well
balanced fodder, will keep indefinitely.
FILL UP THAT GUTTER!
“Pick”: In rainy seasons an exasperating
misery to the landholder is the constant
sight of his best soils being carried off by
running waters. Alluvial flats are often
gradually bared to bedrock by the scouring
of adjacent streams; ploughed lands are
denuded to the subsoil; every sheep or
rabbit track provides a water-course that
eventually scars the landscape with unsightly
chasms and sweeps the most fertile grounds
to lower levels or into the sea.
In many cases it is want of early atten-
tion that does the damage, and the provident
cocky seeks an early remedy. In forest
country boughs with leaves lying upstream in
the runnels will hold the soil and prevent
further erosion. Tussocks, dockweed or
thistle are a fair substitute on plain lands.
On the Monaro plateau (N.S.W.) miles of
disused stonewall fences have been tipped
into waterworn creeks. And in the Eume-
ralla country the extensive planting of wil-
lows has held back acres of the map from
going on down the ’Bidgee.
WINTER EGG SUPPLIES.
“Practical”: There are experts in the
poultry-breeding business throughout Aus-
tralia who, to my personal knowledge, know
their strain of birds and its laying habits
so well that they can hatch their stock of
chicks each season by the aid of the incu-
bator so that the pullets will lay to schedule
time. This has been abundantly proved at
the various laying competitions throughout
the States. Such experts may be few, but
the fact that it is possible to do what they
do should spur all breeders to do likewise.
That is, if they are after big egg profits.
It is the winter fresh-laid egg that is the
big profit-earner. Almost any old hen with
feathers on will lay some eggs during the
spring or early summer months, and not
much attention is required either. This
partly explains the glut season in the egg
business at that time of the year. The
genuine egg-farmer as a rule does not pros-
per on eggs laid in spring and summer, which
is the lay-by period for the harvest to come
of the speculator-producer. The aim should
be autumn and winter eggs. This is the
period when most of the ordinary farm flocks
are non-producers; hence the great shortage
of the genuine fresh egg, and the very high
prices usually obtained for such.
The main point in autumn and winter
egg-production, apart from correct feeding
and housing, is the time of hatching your
chicks, combined with the laying habit of
the strain they are hatched from. Light
breeds such as Leghorns, Campines, Min-
orcas, etc., usually lay from 51 to 61 months
old if well reared, while heavy breeds, such
as Orpingtons, Wyandottes, Langshans,
Rocks, etc., lay at from 61 to 71 months.
After allowing three weeks for incubation
it is a simple matter to work out the month
when you should hatch the various breeds
so that they will come into lay at the desir-
able time. Above all things, don’t hatch
late stuff: they are usually unthrifty and
unprofitable.
SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER.
“Louden” : After several years’ experiment-
ing in the sou’-west of W.A., I decide that
the best way to establish subterranean clover
is to sow with a cover crop of oats. This
affords the young plants plenty of protec-
tion, and they make great headway. If it
is the intention of the grower to use the
binder, the growth made by the sub. will
not, as is commonly supposed, interfere with
the cutting of the crop. But it is necessary
to have a rainfall of 18in. at least to suc-
cessfully grow this queen of fodders.
THE WOOL-DEALER.
“Trepex”: Discussing my article on the
country wool-dealer, “E.S.W.” (B. 5/5/’27)
says that this person offers a city parity on
wool. Emphatically, no, and a few more
noes. It is the business of the dealer to
offer as much below parity as he thinks he
can buy the wool for. In 99 per cent, of
cases he is not buying on order for any
manufacturing house; he is buying for specu-
lation on his own account and he wants
to buy cheaply so that, his re-sale will be
profitable. He is a fungus growth on the
wool trade and serves no useful purpose
whatever. He is a punter who backs his
own knowledge of wool and the gullibility
of the cocky to yield him a handsome return
on his outlay.
Of course, it is regrettable that our late-
shorn wool has to lie dead in the stores for
so long. But how is it to be avoided? After
dll, not very much can be said against a
trade which buys 50 or 60 million pounds’
worth of goods within the space of six
months and pays cash for them. If the
Australian wool-growers were asked to buy
the same value of sheep in the same time,
there would be some scratching about it.
It is doubtful indeed if a quicker rate of
absorption of wool could be arranged or
if it would be advisable. Even if it were,
one wonders if it is a physical possibility
for buyers to value it. In the 98 actual
selling days since August 30 last, during
which our last season’s clip was sold, nearly
a quarter of a million lots of wool were
offered in Sydney alone, or an average of
about 2500 lots per day. Anything bigger
than this could not be efficiently valued. At
any rate, if ever the Australian clip is sold
in the. same space of time as it takes to
shear it, Heaven send me the cash or the
credit to go a-buying. There will be cheap
wool enough knocking about to make a
bigger fortune than even the country dealers
are making now.
AUSTRALIAN WOOL.
“R. E. Combing” : “Jasper” writes of the
degeneration of our wool (B. 28/4/’27). I
assert emphaticallv that Australian wool* has
not degenerated. A deliberate development
upon positive lines cannot be called “de-
generation.” “Jasner” says that sheep-
breeders did not deliberately set out to pro-
duce the animal at which Bradford “scoffs.”
They did! Our flockmasters, for years past,
have been aiming to produce the greatest
possible amount of wool off the best possible
constitutioned sheep. This is done by breed-
ing the big-framed bold-woolled jumbuck. And
it is not Bradford that is the greatest scoffer
at our wool; it is the Continental manu-
facturer. Bradford prefers our robust wool,
though it must be admitted that this season’s
very well fed clip was a little too broad even
for Bradford. For a good many years past,
dating from before the war. there has been
a tendency for the price of the stronger-
quality wools to be disproportionately high
compared with that paid for the finer-haired
fleece. And there is the whole reason for
to-day’s situation. It is a plain commercial
proposition. If a man can receive as much
money per pound or very little less for the
greater quantity he shears off the robust-
woolled sheep, he would be a mug to breed the
animal that gives him the less quantity, and
with it the less return per head. When the
wool-manufacturing trade shows that it wants
fine wool to the extent that it will pay the
proportional additional price for it, then the
goods will be produced, but not till then.
DIPPING.
“J.D.C.”: “Saaedi” (P,. 12/5/’27) finds
trouble in keeping his dip mixture at a uni-
form strength. This is always so when a
powder dip is used, and no amount of stir-
ring will prevent precipitaion; but it can be
avoided by using an oil dip introduced about
three years ago. In this preparation the
arsenic is emulsified, no stirring is necessary,
and a sample taken from any depth at any
stage of the dipping process will give the
same arsenical content. I hope it is not
necessary for me to add that I am not per-
sonally interested in this dip.
A point often overlooked is the advantage
of having a battened floor a couple of inches
above the concrete in the draining-pens. In
this way the sheep droppings and general
filth are not trodden fine, but fall through
the grating, and when run back through the
silt tank are strained out whole, thus pre-
venting to a certain extent the fouling of
the mixture in the bath.
As for sheep being unable to get out after
their swim, if the exit ramp is sufficiently
sloped (not less than three to one) and
cross cleats are provided about four inches
apart to give toehold, they will generally
manage to climb out unless very weak. Also
tlie man who does the ducking should regu-
late their passage through the bath so that
crowding at the exit is avoided.
A rather dangerous omission is neglecting
to thoroughly clean the bath when operations
are concluded. The accumulation of foreign
matter may set up chemical changes, and if
the residue is allowed to mix with the next
filling of the bath an analysis of the mixture
will give startling results.
A CHANGE IN TASTE FOR BEEF.
The 1927 Year Book issued by the Chicago
meat firm of Swift and Co. —it lias large
interests in Australia also —emphasises a
point recently stressed in The Bulletin:
the growing demand for young, nicely topped-
up beef. The former insistence on heavy,
aged beef has gone almost entirely, though a
few classes of buyers, such as the big hotels
and steamship companies, still prefer it.
The great mass of consumers now go for
the lighter cuts, and retailers are looking
for cattle weighing from 9501 b. to 11501 b.
on the hoof. Yearlings, whom no one once
thought of killing, and ranging from 6501 b.
to 9601 b., are, as “baby beef,” the most
keenly-sought-after sorts. The change in
taste is operating not only in America but
in Europe, where the Argentine growers are
catering for the trade. The new idea should
appeal to the Australian cattle-man, obsessed
with the production of big bullocks, and
wasting valuable time in doing it.
One factor for success is absolutely essen-
tial, and that is the quick building up of
the youngster from birth, with no intervals
of retrogression—a method not always prac-
ticable under Australian conditions.
SOUTH AFRICAN WOOLS.
“FY7”: In a recent circular issued by
Kreglinger and Fernau, a very large Conti-
nental buying firm, with offices in Antwerp
and London, the situation is summed up as
follows: “Some excellent wools from South
Africa are being offered, and buyers, dis-
appointed with the quality of many of the
Australian clips, are turning their attention
to the finer Cape wools.” To voice a warn-
ing based on facts like the above is a long
way from what “Trepex” (B. 12/5/’27) calls
“seeing only virtue in others.” It is rather
an attempt to prevent one's own from falling
into the fatal folly of despising one’s enemy
—like “Trepex” does.
THE SUBURBAN DISEASE-
SPREADER.
“H.M.” : There is not likely to be a “clean
bill” in fruit areas while suburban gardeners
are permitted to grow even one tree which
is not kept clean, and there are hundreds of
such careless folk. They ought to be com-
pelled every year to give the butts of the
trees at least a dressing of limewash and a
sprav of soapsuds and kerosene; there would
then" be less loss of fruit through the fly.
While the leaves are off (up to the second
week in June) is the time to get busy.
Especially is this necessary with early
peaches; and a second dressing before June
is out will kill off those missed in the early
round. Besides the fruit-fly, there are
myriads of scales and bug insects sheltering
through the winter to get a living when
spring comes. This simple treatment will
kill most of them.
USES OF SALT.
“Yufu”: Common salt is the farmer’s best
friend. A tablespoonful in a beer-bottle
of water, given once a month, is a better
medicine for a horse than all the patented
stuff. The same mixture given to cows
after calving will clean them out and cool
their blood. A strong solution of salt and
water will harden a horse’s shoulder when
he is in danger of becoming galled. For
this, bathe at least twice a day. A little
dry salt blown through a tube into the eye
of a beast that has the farmer's curse —
“pink-eye”—will cut away the blinding skin;
and a wash, not too strong, will help. But
don’t wait until the skin forms over the eyes
of your herd. As soon as you see a beast

The Beale Piano is recognised as an instrument of quality in
almost every walk of life.
Her Majesty, Queen Mary, recently purchased at Wembley
Exhibition a Beale Piano for Buckingham Palace.
Leading authorities and critics in the musical world, orchestral
directors, educational establishments, statesmen, judges, the
wealthiest of the land, speak in highest praise of the Beale
instrument.
The N.S.W. State Conservatorium of Music —an institute
embracing the best musical experts —in 1924 installed no fewer
than 19 Beale Pianos.
The Presbyterian Ladies Colleges at Pymble, Croydon and
Goulburn, have used Beale Pianos for many years. The princi-
pals have had such entire satisfaction from these instruments
that they have purchased others from time to time as required,
until now there are over 30 Beale Pianos in use.
But beyond all this, the great general public—the final court
of critical judgment—have sealed their approval to the extent
of over 60,000 Beale instruments.
Beale Pianos and Player-Pianos are sold on an extended payment plan
that brings them within reach of the most modest income. Liberal
allowances made on used instruments which are accepted in partial
exchange.

FEEDING SHEEP.
“W.W.”: When feeding sheep on haled
lucerne I’ve found it an excellent plan to
drop the bales about syds. apart, unopened.
This averts the waste from treading, as
three-fourths of the bale is eaten before it
collapses. The wires can be gathered up
later.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Yufu”: A good cattleman can tell the sex
of a calf before its birth. Male calves hang
low, making the mother appear huge,
while female calves rest higher up, with
the result that the mother does not
look so big. And a sure sign that
a cow is within 24 hours of calving
is that the rump—the space between the lnp
and the pelvis bones on either side —sud-
denly sinks in and shows a distinct hollow'.
When you see a springing heifer or cow
hollowed so, keep her in the home paddock.
“J.McG.” : Try this method of tying up a
bull for operation. Get a rope round the
neck, tied not too tight. Get a half-hitch
of the rope round the animal at the loins,
the half-hitch on top of his back. Pull gently
on the rope from behind, and the beast will
go dowm as gently as if lie were going to
lie down to sleep. Get someone to hold
his head, and keep a few pounds’ weight on
the rope from behind. The animal will
neither strain nor move his legs while you
operate. A man with little help can operate
on the strongest and fiercest beast; and in
performing many operations I have not had
any ill-effects.
“Kooragai”: Any kind of land, from sand
to stiff clay, ean‘ be made workable and
(within certain limits) fertile with green
manure. That is, plough all w 7 eeds and
other waste into it instead of burning off.
A sandy plot which is mostly regarded _ as
useless for cultivation can be quickly im-
proved by this means, and if cropped with
cow-peas or other legumes after ploughing
the improving process is more rapid. A fine
transforming agent is a clover-like plant,
scientifically known as Melilotus officinatus.
King Island, originally a barren patch in
Bass Strait, was transformed into rich, fer-
tile soil by the introduction of this legumi-
nous plant.
“Jack Point” : To cure hens of egg-eating,
add half a cupful of vinegar to each gallon
of drinking-water. A cure should result
within a week.
“L’Fou”:. “Feed the brute” as a slogan to
improve the bull's temper is mighty mislead-
ing. As “Jesmond” (B. 12/5/’27) points
out, most reported attacks are made by
hand-fed stud bulls. Idleness and lack of
exercise are usually the greatest factors in
developing viciousness. The bull habitually
running at large is seldom dangerous.
“Kooragai” : A useful weed that crops up
freely on most and is often regarded
as a pest, is the sow (or cow) thistle. I
have seen pigs fed almost exclusively on it
for months at a stretch, and at the same
time it provided excellent green feed for
horses and cattle. Cows thrive on it. So
far as I know 7 , it has not been cultivated
as a regular crop, but as it flourishes nearly
anywhere and can be mown several times,
like lucerne, it would certainly be worth
while as green fodder for dairy cattle.
“Prop”: In 1920 at Roma (Q.) I pumped
and pumped till the pump sucked mud
and then I shifted the sheep. In the same
year I was at Manningham, one of Jow 7 ett’s
stations, managed by Crutch, and he w 7 as in
the same fix —except that before sucking
mud he sank a shaft in the silt and watered
sheep for weeks after the tank w 7 as appa-
rently cut out.
“Anthony Gloster” : To deal with galahs,
the best way is to spread poisoned wdieat
and corn about the cultivation paddock. Fif-
teen years ago a Malice farmer w 7 lio w 7 as
suffering from the depredations of cockatoos
caught a couple alive, cochinealed them and
set them free. He had no more trouble. But
I’ve stuck to strychnine and arsenic.
“J.G.”: Here is a good and easily-come-by
weed-killer that will not, like arsenic, leave
ill effects behind. Boil 21b. common salt
and lib caustic-soda in four gallons (kero-
sene-tin) of water and apply to the w 7 ecds
boiling hot.
BLADEY GRASS.
“Mape.e”: Settlers with new bladey-grass
land which they wish to break up and bring
under cultivation might find the following
hints useful. The knowledge has been gained
by hard practical experience. First, the land
must be ploughed when the grass is green
and full of growth, and the land is wet after
heavy rains—the wetter the better, prefer-
ably in the spring or early summer. If the
ground is dry, and the grass mature, the
roots are hard, like small canes, and when
cut up by the plough will not die, but will
throw 7 out a shoot at every joint after the
first show 7 er of rain, wdiereas if the grass is
young and green the roots are soft and
juicy, and will wither up and die on expo-
sure. The first ploughing is best done by
a single-furrow disc, which must be set to
take a very narrow cut, say, about seven or
eight inches at most, and about the same
depth. Within a fortnight after ploughing,
the land should be well worked across the
lands with a disc cultivator, and then left
lying for two or three months. Then the
second ploughing takes place, across the first,
and with flip plough set a couple of inches
deeper. This should also be done, if pos-
sible. when the ground is wet. After this the
land can be put straight under crop as soon
as it is brought to the proper state of tilth
by harrowing or other cultivation, and with
ordinary care and suitable weather during
the different operations, there should be no
more trouble with the grass.
WOOL-CLASSING IN QUEENSLAND.
“Hadley”; Wool-classing is part of the
necessary education of the sheep-man. The
only technical college in Queensland where
classing is taught is Brisbane. The con-
venient time for a lad to learn is immediately
after leaving day-school—say, at 17. The
college works five days a week, so the
students have every evening and Saturday
and Sunday without occupation. That’s no
good for a country kid loose in the city.
The small niimber of pastoralists’ sons taking
the course is sufficient indication that the
risk is reckoned too great.
Gatton College, which is residential,
teaches wool-classing to a limited extent;
but for a student of wool-classing the Bris-
bane Tech, is the place. Why not reverse
things, so that Gatton becomes the centre?
There pastoralists could send their sons, and
know that they were under whole-time super-
vision.
“Hop Scrub”: Cinnamon should flourish
exceedingly in the heavy rainfall belt of
Queensland. It rejoices in anything up to
100 inches of rain. In Ceylon they grow it
as a bush, in clusters about 3ft. in diameter,
to secure long, clean shoots, which are cut
at two years of age right down to the
ground. Cutting is done after the rainy
season, when the bark “slips” easily. Get-
ting the bark is at best, however, a tedious
job, calling for patience and prehensile toes,
the coolies utilising the latter to hold the
material in position whilst removing the
outer skin of the bark. The “quills” are
worth up to 3s. per lb. in London, and the
total value exported from Ceylon reaches
£139,797 a year.

“Goodnight”: Ring-barking or “cinctur-
ing” currant vines is a much older practice
than “Mirrool” seems to think (B. o/5/’27).
It has been done by growers in Greece for a
great number of years, and was first intro-
duced into Australia by W. C. Grasby, a
Renmark (S.A.) vinegrower. in 1896, after
a visit to Greece, where he found the opera-
tion in general practice. The shyness of
the currant to bear fruit away from Greece
had led to the belief that this vine could
not be grown profitably elsewhere, and the
belief was sedulously fostered by the Greek
dried-fruit interests. Grasby had an idea
that the cincturing of the vine had a lot
to do with its productivity, and his experi-
ments after his return led to its wholesale
adoption.
* s': * *
“A. 8.” : Fruit-trees are often shy bearers,
and it may then pay to run a sharp knife
perpendicularly down the trunk. With
citrus fruits the trouble is common, and it
is surprising the amount of gum which will
run from an incision. Let it be done down
the trunk near the lowest limb.
* * * *
“8.L.D.” : Although “Saaedi” (B. 5/5/’27)
considers the recent discussion of over-
insurance of crops “parrot-talk” and avers
that it isn’t easy to collect much in excess
of a crop’s value, I think he is wrong in
regarding this evil lightly. It’s not what
a farmer collects, but what he hopes he’ll
collect, that matters. As to the fencing, it
is generally insured too ; and often the un-
scrupulous man may be a share-farmer with
no interest in thefencing. The agent w T ho came
out this way last season had no idea of
judging the yield of a crop, and -would insure
a three-bag for eight bags quite cheerfully.
* * * *
“F.S.H.”: If “Rene” (B. 5/5/’27) wants
to get rid of tree-borers, let him try this.
Thrust a length of copper wire into the
orifice and seal the entrance with mud. The
wood will grow round the wire, but the
corroding copper poisons the tree within a
certain distance of the hole ; and there’s not
a borer that will dig into the copper-tainted
wood.
* * * *
“Zolicoffer”: Despite “J.D.C.” (B.
21/4/’27) re mares in foal, I don’t think
the sex has anything to to with the period
of gestation. I have acted as night-nurse,
year after year, for mares, have had to
watch them from anything up to 18 days
over their time, and the sex of the foals
has been about even. I know the case of a
mare having 11 foals in 11 years right up
to time, and eight of them were males.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: Pinkeye rarely causes per-
manent blindness (“J.D.C.,” B. 5/5/’27).
The Avorst feature about it is that if it
occurs in hot weather the sheep are in
danger of dying of thirst during their blind-
ness. This is more particularly the case if
the disease is general. When only a few
are affected the sound sheep will lead their
sightless comrades to the water. I have never
known pinkeye to occur save in a good sea-
son. What (if any) is the connection
between the flush of feed and the disease?

“Biro” : To prevent blue mould in lemons
and to keep the rind firm, snip off the fruit
just as they begin to tinge yellow. Place
them in a 5 p.c. solution of borax at a
temperature of 115° Fahr. and leave them
for five minutes. Drain off, lift the
lemons carefully and' place in cases. Or
cover the lemons with mutton-fat, melted and
mixed with boracic-acid —a tablespoon of
boracic to a half kerosene-tin of fat ; dip
them in while the solution is warm. The
job must be done immediately the lemons
are snipped.

“Emel”: Nowadays in Victoria it is
illegal to put any cliaffcutter on the market
without a safety device. Only old machines
are to be found without such attachments.
The maximum fine for a breach is £lOO, but
the full penalty is seldom imposed. In the
last prosecution I know of a firm was fined

“T. J.” : Turkey-raising isn’t the gilt-edged
proposition it seems at first sight. (B.
12/5/’27). To begin with, turkeys are deli-
cate creatures in their infancy. But tin;
main trouble about them is that they are
such terrors to ramble, and so fall victims
to foxes, eagles and hawks. We once man-
aged to rear nearly 100 beautiful birds, only
to lose the lot of them in a single day through
phosphorus poisoning. The poison-cart had
not approached nearer than two miles from
the homestead, but the turkeys had found the
trail and followed it, until every one had
eaten a fatal dose.

A TRILLIONS-CLTJB DINNER.
The Ambassadors was a feast of color
last night when members of Parliament
who have been in prison sat down to the
annual dinner served by the Trillions Club in
their honor.
Sir Clydesdale Jink extended a cordial
welcome to the guests on behalf of the club,
and in the course of a brief speech said he
was glad to see that most of
the well-known faces present
retained their prison pallor
unimpaired. They had all
done one good stretch at
least. (Hear! Hear!) He
himself, though restrained by
modesty hitherto from pro-
claiming it, had been in gaol
17 times, and had lost three
teeth through his impetuosity
being quelled by a police-
man’s baton. But he did not
say this in a bragging spirit.
(Loud applause.) He would
go so far as to asseverate
that nobody should be elected
to Parliament who had not
been in gaol. (Cheers.) He
might even express the hope
that our penitentiaries would
grow fuller and fuller, and he
looked forward confidently to
the time when people would
be born in them, thus quali-
fying at a tender age for a
political career. (Prolonged
applause.)
At tlie conclusion of Sir
( iydesdale Jink’s remarks
Mr. Horace Primrose said a
few encouraging words in his
official capacity as vice-pre-
sident of the Citizens’
Reform League. A gentle-
man introduced as “The
Master Mind of the Under-
world” also spoke. He apolo-
gised for never having been
in gaol, and hoped that, in
spite of his age, detectives
would some day have a legi-
timate excuse for temporarily
interrupting what had hither-
to been a peacefully nefa-
rious career. (Cheers.)
A letter written on grey
paper, with a decoration of
broad arrows, was read from
a well-known member of a previous Parlia-
ment, apologising for his absence on account
of a depressing engagement at Bathurst.
After a brief address by the governor of
Long Bay gaol, the signal was passed to the
band by Sir Clydesdale Jink, which there-
upon gave an emotional rendering of “The
Prisoner’s Song.”
Several comedians from Fullers’ and the
Tivoli, who had been specially engaged,
delighted the guests with their antics as
warders, turnkeys and hangmen. Proceed-
ings closed with the throwing of colored
streamers and the singing of the Froth Blow-
ers’ Anthem.

When the post is passed, and the race is

At Caulfield, Randwick or Robbery Park,
You’ll know that the wrong ’un again has

By the angry cry of the futile nark.
For ever and always his song of woe
Some crying blankard is sure to squeak—
The old, old song with the words that go:
“That ain’t the form of larst Saterdee
week.”
Oh, the critic host is a mighty band!
For ever we find as we pass along
There is one of the know-all tribe on hand
Ready to prove that our form is wrong.
Nothing it matters how hard we try.
Nothing we do can avert the shriek
From those whose mission it is to cry:
“That ain’t the form of larst Saterdee
week.”
When up the long stairway we hump our
packs
And the likeliest stories we try to tell—r
For it’s whether we run on the cinder tracks,
Or whether we roam through the aspho-
del —
Our hope to shatter, our chance to spoil,
Before St. Peter has time to speak
Someone of these blankards will give the oil:
“That ain’t the form of larst Saterdee
week.”

pretty blonde with bobbed hair.”
Dear Princess Hetepheres, please excuse
The ultra-modern lauguage that I use,
And pardon me if I in manner rude
Upon your ancient dynasty intrude;
But what especially I want to know
Is how you lived in centuries ago.
For instance, did Egyptian boys prefer
The blondes that in those distant ages were?
And were there busy barbers’ shops that gave
Your pretty head that everlasting wave?
And, Princess, were your locks your very
own—
Come, tell me truly, were they all home-
grown ?
And when you ventured out with fair locks
bobbed
Were you by scribes and agitators mobbed?
And when your latest shingle you had dyed
And got it marcelled, did you then decide
It didn’t suit you in the least —and did
You wish you hadn’t done it, poor, wee kid?

A Serenade at Streaky Flats.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A JUNCTION of the railway-line gives
the bush township of Streaky Flats
an excuse for existence, and the
Railway Hotel—caravanserai for marooned
transients of the time-tables —-is its chief
industry, recreation and point of contact
with the outside world. The remainder of
the township is notable only for rural
scenery, dust and sunshine.
It was evening. To all save those who
knew the password the hotel bar was
closed, and Miss Yera Perkins, imported
barmaid, yellow-haired, statuesque, a product
of the metropolis, was taking her tea in
the kitchen. The dining-room was her legiti-
mate sphere for meals, but in the kitchen
was company in the form of Mrs. Cogger,
the cook.
Miss Perkins gazed abstractedly through
the open door and frowned. There were
several reasons for the frown. In the first
place she was a Sydney girl, and the silence
of the bush made her head ache. Secondly,
in Streaky, she found herself deprived of
her natural vocation—the charming and sub-
duing into homage of the enemy, man, for
the local men were scarcely of the type
for whom she was wont to spread her gilded
net. And, thirdly, one over whom she had
thrown a Cupid’s lariat had slipped fr.om
the noose, thereby wounding her pride.
Mrs. Cogger gazed at her. A Londoner
was cook, kindly, sympathetic and very
interested in the affairs of those around
her.
'•What’s the matter, dearie V” she queried.
"My! You are looking down in the mouth.
Wasn’t there anything for you in the mail
to-day 7”
Miss Vera shook her beautiful head.
"There was not,” said she shortly. “Cook,
did you ever meet a man you could trust V"
Mrs. Cogger brightened. The query formed
an opening gambit to one of her favorite
topics of conversation. She was conversa-
tional upon many themes, but none more
so than on the shortcomings of Man. She
lowered her teacup and shook her head.
“I did not,” she replied. “Nor do I
expect to. They’re all alike, honey, every
manjack of ’em! Fickle and unreliable and
not to be trusted. But you ought to
know; you see plenty. I always says a
girl behind the bar”- -
"Oh, I know them —too right I do !” cut
in Miss Perkins. “As you say, you can’t
work behind a bar without learning a thing
or two. A lot of bad eggs—all of them.
And the married ones is the worst.”
The cook nodded encouragingly. Miss Per-
kins speared a pickle with unnecessary
severity. Confidences seemed in order.
“Six weeks ago,” she continued, “I left
Sydney for this place. Sleepy Hollow is
'vhat I call it. Well, when the time came
to leave a thing that called itself a man
came to the station to see me off. Oh, I
knew he was married all right, but he used
to behave so nicely when he took me out,
and acted so serious, that when he said good-
bye and promised to write every week regular
I thought But there! You can’t believe
a word they tell you. Not a line has he writ-
ten ! Not that it matters, of -course,” she
added, tossing her head. “Only it just goes
to show, doesn’t it?”
“Ah,” agreed the cook. “Married or
single, they’re all alike. And when they
start promising—look out!”
“Of course,” pursued A 7 era, “I might have
known better. He was a traveller. And
anyway, the men a girl gets to know in a
city bar are generally smarties and four-
flushers. I’m through with them—-cheap lot
of sprucers! Cook, if I ever get married it
will be to one of these country boys. They may
not be so easy on the eyes, but a girl can
tell how she stands with them.”
“Meaning George Peters,” smiled cook,
knowingly. “You might do a lot worse,
dearie, for lie runs the biggest farm in the
district. But there you are again. A month
ago he was running after the Pringle girl.
The eldest one. It just shows, don’t itV”
“Oh, her!” remarked Miss Perkins, sniff-
ing delicately. “I’ve seen her. The freckled-
faced one. She wears men’s boots and long
skirts. Thirty if she’s a day. Mr. Peters
is much too good for her. Besides, a girl
lias to look out for herself in this world. I
think I could be happy with Mr. Peters.
Those city boys never have any money, any-
way.”
“You only got to set your cap at him,
dearie,” remarked cook. “I seen him making
goo-goo eyes at you. And him out with
the Pringle girl only a week ago. Oh, these
men!”
:fc H* ❖
It was dusk. Miss Perkins, cool and desir-
able, sat on a garden seat on the hotel
verandah. On the extreme end of the same
seat sat Mr. George Peters, essaying polite
conversation. George was a product of the
bush, tall, lean 1 , bronzed and, in the presence
of the charmer, inarticulate. Throughout
his life any conversation he was called upon
to make had been upon three familiar rural
topics, weather, wethers and wheat. Rain-
fall, wheat and sheep had formed the material
for his advances towards the heart of Sarah
Pringle, but alas! he was learning that this
agricultural repertoire seemed to lack punch
in the presence oi the beautiful Miss Vera.
However, she smiled kindly with her big blue
eyes, and tried to help him out.
“Don’t the moon look bonser, shining
through the wheat shed ?” she murmured,
moving a couple of imperceptible inches
Georgewards.
George shuffled his feet. When he was
feeling self-conscious his knuckles cracked.
They did so now\
“Bonserlie admitted. “But I was in
hopes we’d be havin’ rain. Tli’ crops”
Miss Vera bit her red lips. For three
evenings now she had been feeding him
helpful cues, and instead of making a wooer’s
use of them lie converted them into wheat
or sheep. She was not familiar with such
long-range attacks. Talking of crops seemed
like sheer waste of time to her.
“Jim,” she cooed in her soft, modulated
voice, “no, George. George, surely on a
beautiful evening like this we should let our
hearts expand to the —er, the charms of
our surroundings, forgetting the cares and
anxieties of —er, the crops, in the joys of
the present”
She paused to scratch an ankle where a
mosquito had been biting her. Sometimes
her conversation was spiced unknowingly
with the poetic captions of the film, for she
was an ardent picturegoer.
George gave a mirthless laugh. “Too
right,” said he. “I see what you mean, Miss
Perkins. But when a cove gets livin’ alone
in tli’ bush he sees so much of th’ flamin’
THE ONLY CONDITION.
“It simply isn’t possible for a man to love two women at the same time!"
“Oh, isn’t it! He could love a dozen as long as the other eleven didn’t know.”
moon he gets that way he ain’t got no time
for it, see’”
Feeling this remark was scarcely one of
his best efforts, he cracked his knuckles and
made a fresh attempt. Miss Vera was not
interested in crops ; he would speak to her of
the cities.
“Tli’ bush ’ll seem slow to you after livin’
in Sydney, Miss, won’t it?’ he queried. “I
always hankered to get there. Me and old
Bob Thurlow talked about takin’ a trip
several years now, only what with summer
fallowin’ an’ one thing ’n’ another, we always
put it off. But it must be bonser, from all
they tell me.”
Miss Perkins sat up suddenly. She re-
called the promises of her city escort and the
faithlessness of man. His neglect still rank-
led in her mind.
“George.” said she, “please do not speak
to me of the cities. If only you knew them
as I do, with their shams and pretences and
lies. Give me the bush, where men are men
and not just plain, lyin’, double-faced —er
—speak to me of your life under the
smiling heavens, describe your battles in the
wilds! Only leave out the crops and the
sheep. And do not mention the rainfall.”
George crossed his long legs and scratched
his head. {The beautiful creature by his side
was ashing for a description of life at the
homestead. He pondered for outstanding
events in the daily round.
“Last week,” he commenced, slowly and
deliberately, as the items came to his mind,
“I summer fallowed the fifty-acre against
flag-smut.... There was a row over at
Ellison’s place on account of young Bill
puttin’ a dead snake in th’ pommy’s bed....
Old Thurlow's mare, Dorrie, got in th’ crik
and ricked a shoulder... .Th’ tibby died
through eatin’ cockchafers.... I drew a boil
from Fatty Tooey’s arm with a warm bottle
....The eldest Simpson girl at Kowulka
run off with th’ schoolmaster.... Sfeve
Dinny found a bees’ nest in th’ old tallow-
wood.... I killed two snakes an’ a goanna
near th’ tank.... Mick Flanuigan’s cow,
Strawberry, got gallstones”
But Miss Perkins had departed.
Sorrowfully George drove his weather-
beaten Ford homeward through the bush.
Brooding, he muttered curses on his own
head as he opened the throttle and sent the
rabbits flying up on the track. He had
upset Miss Vera. She had gone crook on
liis conversation. And no wonder! Well,
he would do better next time. She w T as a
bonser tart, and he would make any effort
to please her.
He paused in his meditations, overcome
with an idea amounting to an inspiration.
“Gorramiglity !” In’ ejaculated, slapping his
leg. “Give her what she wants! Speak
in th’ words of them story-book coots. Learn
a piece b’ heart; somethin’ lovin’ and poetic
and full er flamin’ sunsets. And then say
it at her like a kid at school recitin’.”
Filled with a vague hope, Mr. Peters
developed liis scheme. For the next few
days his rugged features were overcast with
the abstraction of mental effort, and he
went about the paddocks whispering and
muttering. His evenings were spent poring
over a few battered magazines and volumes,
selected only after much laborious reading.
When he was satisfied no one was near, he
propped a mirror up on the wheat-pickler
and recited what he had learned to an accom-
paniment of impassioned gestures in which
his long arms were used to their, full extent.
And at last he was word-perfect and confi-
dent.
Miss Perkins was seated upon a pile of
sleepers down by the gleaming railroad lines.
Mr. Peters, arrayed in his blue suit and
brown shoes and a batswing bow recom-
mended by the storekeeper, stood by her
side.
“George,” said the beautiful one, “I’m
sorry I was abrupt the other night. I
suppose you kept away because I hurt your
feelings. But you know—or perhaps you
don’t know—we girls are sensitive creatures.
We have our feelings. And sometimes we
sigh for a comforting word, a little senti-
ment to color the daily round. We love to
dream of the big, strong men who will some
day enter our lives.”
In the light of his learning Mr. Peters's
fears had nearly vanished, the power of
speech, even before Miss Vera, was restored.
Pie stood before her and waved his arms.
The flood of his eloquence broke.
“Marry me, Vera,” he croaked hoarsely.
“Marry me, ’n’ let us away ; away from tli’
mad crowd’s ignoble strife to th’ sun-kissed
uplands; away, hand in hand, to where th’
rainbow ends. Let us away.”
Miss Perkins gazed curiously at the
farmer. So that was why he had not been
in for three days!
“Mr. Peters,” she interrupted. “You have
been spotting! I thought you promised
never”
“I ain’t,” cut in George. “Not a drop.
An’ you know it. An’ lis’n, or I'll lose me
place. In a tent beneath a gum-tree we will
live an’ lie reclined —no, that bit comes
later. Come, then, do not say me nay, fair
maid, but hie#vith me to th’ tall timbers--
away to where tli’ lightnin’ flashes, wher ■
th’ sunset greets tli’ dawn, where there ain't
no Ten Commandments ’n’ a bloke mal;»s
good with brawn. ’N’ there, axe in hand, will
I strive an’ hew, with love to spur me on,
in tli’ silence of th’ —of th’ —of tli’ ”
“I know,” said Miss Perkins, sitting up.
“The great open spaces!”
"Yairs,” smiled George.
“I thought so,” she said.
“ ’N’ then,” continued her lover, “like
lotus-eaters w r e will live ’n’ lie reclined in
a tent beneath th' gum-trees. Eh?”
Miss Perkins got down off the sleepers.
She shivered. “George,” said she, “I think
I will be going in now. It is chilly out
here.”
Her lover humored her. Miss Vera, lie
was learning, was a creature of sudden im-
pulses ; impulses he could never hope to
understand. And although she remained
silent on their return to the hotel, he felt
a certain happy triumph horn of hope. Girls,
he had read, when they found love dawning
in their bosoms, became capricious and silent
in just such a manner.
At the side door of the hotel he nerved
himself.
“Miss Perkins —Vera,” he whispered, “you
hev’n’t give me no answer. What about it,
eh?”
“I will give you your answer,” said Miss
Perkins, disappearing into the hotel, “to-
morrow.”
On the following evening Mr. Peters, suit-
ably attired, drove in to Streaky Flats for
liis answer. Mrs. Cogger came to the side
door of the hotel to meet him.
“I am sorry,” said he. “Miss Perkins
asked me to tell you: She has returned to
Sydney. She said you scared her stiff with
your bush yarns.”
“Me? Scared her?” echoed the incredulous
George.
The cook nodded with an air charged with
reproof and condemnation.
“Yes,” she replied. “Said you was talk-
ing of a new selection in the Backblocks,
and had the nerve to ask her to go batching
with you. Oh, you men!”
ALFRED J. LAMBERT.
Sydney Streets.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
, -]PKOY was once a bustling town,
j Time is tearing Sydney down ;
-*• With her streets in disarray
Beauty waits another day.
Gone is now the mellow gold
Of the gracious sandstone old;
All the city’s miles and miles
Glitter bright with glassy tiles.
Desolation gapes between
All the beauty that has been ;
Time may yet her pride unfold—
Beauty battens on the old.
Still the little lanes from town
Trickle to the Harbor down,
Hastening eagerly to lave
In the lip-lap-lapping wave.
Cliff to cliff the buildings frown,
Each aloofly looking down;
Bordering a gaunt ravine
Is a niggard splash of green.
Towers tall with sunlight crowned.
With their roots deep underground,
And beneath and further down
Hides another Sydney town.
Where is Sydney’s beating heart?
None can find it; yet, apart,
Is she beckoning to a goal?
Has this syren got a soul?
N.s.w.

OBJECTIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES
“Thrift is more than mere saving. It is more, even, than wise spending.
It is both an End and a Means to an End—an Objective and a means cf
attaining that Objective.
“We all want our lives so ordered that we can get the best the World has
to offer. But we can’t acquire unless we strive; and we can’t strive intelligently
and effectively without a purpose.
“The foundation of every worth-while purpose is Thrift.”
—John !C. Staley.
Given the purpose (and who is so lacking in Ambition that he has no
purpose?) you will find no more effective method of Thrift Practice than the
Savings Account.

Information Sought.
A Queensland railway by-law states that
any person taking possession of a seat tem-
porarily vacated by a passenger who has
left something to indicate his previous pos-
session of it shall be liable to a penalty of
£2 and removal. Is there a similar law in
N.5.W.?— 365.
N.S.W. Railway By-law 48 states: “It
shall not be lawful for any passenger to take
possession of the seat in a railway-carriage
of any other passenger who lias been occupy-
ing such seat. and who has temporarily left
the carriage for refreshments or other pur-
poses. Any person so offending,' and refus-
ing to give up the seat to the previous
occupant, shall be liable to. a penalty not
exceeding Two Pounds.”
[ lease a paddock at a rental paid Quar-
terly in advance. The agreement (oral), is
that I receive or give three months' notice
of intention to quit. This teas made with
the manager acting for owner, who has since
died. ,The beneficiaries Irish to sell at once,
('an T remain in possession until term paid
for has expired, and can I then claim three
months' notice to give up the paddock? 1
have stock and no other pasturage. —374.
You leave much to be assumed. Assuming
this to be a tenancy from quarter to quarter
(i.e.. periods of three months), you
would be entitled to three months’ notice to
quit expiring on next rent day. Assuming
the manager to have acted within his
authority as agent for the owner, you are
entitled to remain in possession of the land
for which rent has been paid by you.
How is boric acid put in butter? What
quantity is used? Are boric and boracic
the same thing? —3B4.
Boric (or boracic) acid is dusted over
the butter with salt and worked into it at
the same time. Quantity allowed under the
law is -I p.c.—about Joz. for every 31b. In
N.S.W. it is not the practice in butter fac-
tories to add boric acid, nor from a health
point of view can it be recommended. The
law is likely to be amended, and Australia
will come into line with Britain and the
U.S.A., and prohibit its use in dairy pro-
duce.
I have a very old painting. How can I
find out if it is valuable? —380.
Show it to Tyrrell’s, Ltd.. 26 Martin-place.
Sydney; and Lyster Ormsby, 26 Hunter-
street, Sydney.
Have a family, two girls, three boys, I!)
to 7. Want to get them to Sydney. Am
digging in myself , and. it will be two years
before I can earn enough to pay the fares
and provide their outfit. Is there any fund
that will help? They were all born in the
South Seas. —391.

Immigration Office, cr. Flindcrs-street and
Oollins-place, Melbourne, or the Director.

Industry, 132 George-street, Sydney.
If me can J get tickets in the Calcutta on
Ihe English Derby? —394.
The Calcutta Turf Club has stopped the
issue of printed tickets owing to forgeries
and other abuse!?. “Numbers” are now’
allotted at about 16s. each and only obtain-
able through members of the Calcutta Turf
Club. The club does not publish any infor-
mation about the draw.
How can [ make “mineral” leather? I'm a
miner, and the solution in the mine water will
destroy a pair of boots per week if they are
not. “mineralised .” —294.
“Stonewall” Jackson, cr. Pitt and Goul-
burn streets, Sydney, manufacture and sell
a line of boots for combating mineral solu-
tions. The process of “chrome” tanning is
not secret, but is a chemical one, and great
care must be taken with it—hands must be
gloved, arms covered and face smeared with
grease. Space is not available to describe it.
but a description written by Mr. J. H. Watts,
of Adamstown (N.S.W.), has been posted.
There is apparently no process for “mineral-
ising” boots made of ordinary leather.
What is the Verge Trust? Who controls
it?— 397.
Tlie German Verge Trust administers the
N.S.W. estate left by German Verge for the
benefit of necessitous ex-soldiers, and their
dependants or dependants of deceased sol-
diers ; the money goes in relief outside the
scope of Repat. benefits. One of the trustees,
Fred Davison, is a direct R.S.L. represen-
tative. Address, 12 Spring-street, Sydney.
The tonnage of H.M.S. Canada, of the
R.N. during the tear? The size of our big-
gest toarshtp ? —399.
H.M.S. Canada, now in the Chilean Navy
(the Almirante Latorre) —she was taken
over by the R.N. during the war and re-
turned to Chile in 1920 —-has a displacement
of 28,000 tons. The Hood, our largest, has
a displacement of 41,200 tons, is 860 ft.
length overall and 104 ft. in breadth.
Farmer's ( Sydney ) advertise a debenture
issuej interest, 6 p.c. p.a.j price of issue,
£96 10s. They state: “The effective rate of
interest is therefore £6 Ss. 6d. per cent. llow
is this rate arrived at? —412.
The investor gets £6 p.a. for every £96 10s.,
which works out at £6 4s. 4d. p.c. In addition,
at the end of 12 years 2 months (the loan
is for that period) he gets £lOO for his
£96 10s. Approximately 4s. 2d. is the value
of the £3 10s. (the difference between £96
10s. and £100) spread over the 12 years in
annual payments.
What should one do to become a, pro-
ducer of ( 1) films, (2) stage plays? —4oB.
(1) A producer who has directed films both
here and in America recommends: Go to
Hollywood and work in any capacity; props,
lights, scenes or extra, and study carefully
the man with the megaphone. Need enough
capital to live for at least six months, plus
return fare. Or join up with one of the Aus-
tralian companies, Australian Films, Ltd.,
and Phillips Film Productions, Ltd., who are
both employing American directors, and offer
your services in an honorary capacity. (2)
Join up with an alert repertory society or a
professional stock company, and you’ll get a
smattering of the things you ought to know.
Will you please give me the exact con-
tents of a paddock : 62 chns. Iyd. on one side
and 61chns. lyds. on the other, by 31 chns.
12yds. on one end and 33chns. 6yds. on the
other? —191.
Can’t be done unless at least one angle
is known. Draw a square. Then draw a
very flat parallelogram, with the sides the
same length as the square, and see how
different the areas are.
Have a Reichsbank-note dated November
19, 1922, for 50,000 marks. Also one dated
September 20, 1923, for 20,000 marks. Any
value? —4o9.
The old Reichsbank-notes could only be
exchanged up to July 5, 1925 at the official
rate of one billion marks to Reichsmark
(Is.). The notes you have, are therefore
valueless.
Want to freshen up my arithmetic. Am
a station-owner and far removed from any
chance of personal tuition. Can you recom-
mend a correspondence tutor? —299.
International Correspondence School, 399
George-Street, Sydney, and Stott’s Technical
Correspondence College, 9-11 O’.Connell-
street, Sydney, both conduct a correspondence
course in mathematics.
Can I prevent a neighbor from imperilling
a dividing-fence by placing soil against it? T
have already had to renciv it once. —377.
Vic. Fences Act 1915 (sec. 6) says:
“When any dividing-fence made or to be
made is out of repair or becomes insufficient,
the occupiers of land on either side shall be
liable to the cost of repairing such fence in
equal proportions.” Call the owner’s atten-
tion to this provision and ask him to bring
it before the notice of his tenant, as if
injury is done to the fence you will enforce
the section quoted.
I contemplate encircling Australia in a
Ford, ( 1 ) Is there any reason why I should
not attempt it? (2) Best, month to start?
( 3) Best route to take? {lf) What maps,
etc., would help? —427.
(1) It is hazardous and difficult, but as
Michael Terry went from Brisbane to
Broome in a Ford and others have gone from
Broome around by way of Perth, Adelaide,
Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane, it is
possible. (2) Do not venture into the N.T.
during its wet season (December-Feb-
ruary). (3) Get into touch with the Q’land
R.A.C., Elizabeth-street, Brisbane, and the
W.A.R.A.C., Barrack-street, Perth. In the
other States you would follow beaten tracks.
(4) Lands Depts. of the various States and
Home and Territories Dept., Spring-street,
Melbourne, publishers of guide-books, and the
various automobile associations would help.
Where can ] learn commercial art, car-
tooning, etc.? Fees, etc.? —428.
The Trade Drawing Course at East Syd-
ney Technical College, Darlinghurst, which
costs £1 ss. per year for three or four
evenings per week, should help you. Com-
municate with S. V. Rowe at the school.
Dattilo-Rubbo also conducts a Commercial
Art section at his school, 15 Bligh-street,
Sydney.
What is the number of second-class smok-
ing carriages compared with the second-class
ordinary carriages on the average Sydney
suburban train? —369.
According to regulation, “one-half of the
accommodation of each class on the train
must be ‘Smoking.’ When the number of
vehicles of any class is odd. the odd vehicle
must be ‘Non-smoking,’ unless special in-
structions to tlie contrary are given.” On a
train consisting of eight cars (one first-
and seven second-class) there would, in
accordance with the above regulation, be
three smoking and four non-smoking second-
class vehicles.
Where was Phil Man born? When and
where did he die? How long was he on The
Bulletin ? —437.
Phil May was born at Wortley, Yorkshire,
April 22, 1864; died London August 5,
1903. Was with Tiie Bulletin from end
of 1885 to middle of 1888.
What papers, etc., published in Sydney,
besides The Bulletin and Mirror, buy
short stories and articles ? —43s.
For a start, Sydney Mail, Smith's
.Veekxy, Triad. Woman’s Budget, Green
Room Magazine, World’s News and Home.
The dailies buy articles.
What will a three-weeks' holiday at Nor-
folk Island cost if it can be done ? —43l.
The Makambo leaves Sydney every five
weeks. The trip occupies five days each way,
and passengers must wait on the island about
18 days to connect with return steamer.
Fare, £9 each way. Homely accommodation
can be got, 30s. to 425. per week.
Information Supplied.
184.- —To apply washing-soda to a man-
darin-tree: (1) Sprinkle 411). soda at lease
a foot from the tree-butt, and dig in; then
water. (2) Mix 41b. soda to four gallons
water and mulch at the base of the tree.
(3.) Apply in the form of the residue of the
wash-tub, which, if sprayed on the limbs, will
also kill aphis and vermin. Once a month
is quite often enough.—M.H.
184. —No mention is made of the purpose
for which it is desired to apply washing-
soda to the roots of a mandarin-tree: it is
useless as a fertiliser, and if the enquirer
hopes thus to destroy fungus or insect pests
on the tree, he will be disappointed. Ii d
were possible for the tree to absorb through
its root system enough soda to kill pests, it
would kill itself as well. —-Max.
260. —To stop a bull from breaking through
fences, shade his eyes, so that he cannot see
straight ahead. Take a piece of strong
board about half or one inch thick, Bin.
wide, and 14 or 15 inches long, bore two
Jin. holes 3in. from either end, pass a rope
or fine chain through the holes, and secure
round his horns, so that the board lies across
his forehead and partly obscures his sight.
—B.M.
159. —To renovate a cement path, tar and
sand would not do. Obtain some fine clean
sand; mix with cement while dry in the
proportion of two of sand to one of cement.
Place this mixture in a bucket, stir to a
thin paste with water. Pour into the cracks.
For top-dressing use a whiting-brush and
paint the top all over. As. each coat dries
another can be added until sufficient has
been applied.—,T. W. Gilham.
260. —To stop a bull from going through
fences, get a forked sapling 2-lin. through
and 18in. long to the fork. Let the two
prongs forming the fork stand a foot above
the beast’s neck. Tie these prongs across
his neck with rope, hide or wire, and if the
bull wants to go out of where he is, he must
take the fence with him. If the bull is a
jumper, turn up Bulletin 21/4/’27, page
31.—Paul C.

No Petrol
tl TT was early—very early in the morning,
and the motor car had run out of
petrol No garage was open near at
hand, but a taxicab was drawn up at the
city kerb.
The taxi driver would supply petrol, hut
there was no means of transferring it from
one tank to another. When a man and
his wife leave a dance at 3 a.m. it is not
fair for him to ignore the petrol gauge.
As usual, it was the woman who solved
the problem. Removing her gold-braided
dancing shoes, she offered them as panni-
kins. The taxi driver filled and refilled
them with petrol till about a quart had
been transferred. And they all lived
happily ever afterwards.”

NOTIONS
Under the \Vhip
If the boy hadn’t been in such a hurry to
hit the front Reference (4 to 1) would have
won the first division of the Flying Handicap
at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday.
As it was, the natty St. Anton gelding, who
will probably improve with age, like others
of liis tribe, was beaten in the last stride or
two by an outsider, Limited (12 to 1). There
was some hooting after the race, but
Cadenza's jockey, not Reference’s, was the
target. However, Cadenza’s showing was no
worse than those of other warm favorites
during the day. Asunder (10 to 9) could
not get a place in the first division of the
Nursery Handicap, which went to a Sea
Prince gelding called Flinders (20 to 1),
owned by William Kelso and trained by liis
son Jack; and Gyron (2 to 1) was just as
lamentable a disappointment in the Campsie
Handicap, wherein the hurdler Cherry Ripe
(14 to 1) romped home from the biggest field
of the afternoon —and some of ’em just out
for an airing. Moreover, Gooringin (evens),
down from the country with the reputation
of being a clinker, could only get third to
Bavacre (7 to 1) and Yahwee (12 to 1)
in a division of the Trial Stakes.
The absolute favorites that proved trust-
worthy were Magdaff (2 to 1) in the second
division of the Trial Stakes, Bunkum (9 to
41 in the second division of the Flying Han-
dicap, and Royal Sun (3 to 1) in the Canter-
bury Cup. Magdaff, a nice cut of a Magpie
gelding in Price’s stable, is probably capable
of winning in better company; nor has the
handicapper got the measure of Bunkum, who
is by Humbug—Ballet Queen. Royal Sun’s
capital form at Randwick prepared many
punters for his success, and they mostly got
on at fours. Ridden a well-judged race by
Adams, Keith’s importation was too good for
Octember (6 to 1) and Ilinchinbrook (8 to
1) over the last bit; Chris and Reonui were
unable to manage the 11 furlongs, which
were run in 2min. 22 l-ssee. By Sunstar
(winner of the 1911 Epsom Derby) out of
Royal Dart, Royal Sun is more fashionably
bred than many of the English horses that
come this way, and the best of him has by
no means been seen yet. He is still only a
four-year-old by Australian reckoning. The
big, avrkward Octember, who is by the same
sire (October) as the late Bitalli, should
also be advantaged by time and more experi-
ence of the business, though he may not be
quite a Bitalli.
The new totalisator regulations were tested
for the first time at a Saturday meeting, and
the verdict was decidedly unfavorable. One
objection is that it is now impossible to cal-
culate what the tote will return, it having
been made virtually blind; another is that
divs. on winners quoted at liberal odds in the
ring are “milked” for the benefit of favorites,
should the latter run second or third ; further,
owing to the complicated arithmetical pro-
cess, people have to wait twice as long at
the pay-out windows as under the old system.
The Bulletin man’s experience is worth
relating. Recklessly backing his own tips, he
risked £2 10s. in 10s. tickets on Reference
(18s. came back), Shanakiel (loss), Bavacre
(£1 Bs.), Royal Sun (£1 Is. 6d.), and Sir
Honor (loss) ; two wins, a second and two
misses for a profit of 17s. 6d. At ss. each
way in the little starting-price shop round
the corner —there are hundreds of such shops
in Sydney, and a thousand or more s.-p.
agents—the £2 10s. would have returned
with £2 2s. added, and no expenses to come
out of it, not even a tram fare. There will
be a lot of seceders to s.-p. shops if the
Government doesn’t drop the cranky arrange-
ment. The old 60-20-20 method was better;
the Adelaide plan of two divs. is better still;
the Westralian system of straight-out and
equal-division place, machines is best of all.
Leading jockey Stan Davidson ? who rode
Piastoon in the Sydney Cup, was on five
winners and a third at the Newcastle Cup
meeting on Saturday; and there were only
six races. Four of the skilful youngster’s
mounts were favorites, but 8 to 1 was avail-
able about Horton Gag in the Newcastle Cup,
Tibbie being the public fancy at 3 to 1. After
a most interesting set-to Horton Gag, a Tam-
worth-owned three-year-old by imported
Rangag (sire of Irish Prince) out of Horton
Queen, got the better of the consistent but
unlucky Coolgong (7 to 1) by a short head;
the penalised Land of Leisure (4 to 1)
was a length away. The big brown
did very well to run third in a fast 11-
furlong race (2min. 20sec. was the time),
considering that he had been prepared for
six-furlong sprints. There were 19 starters.

Old Admctus, winner of the Brisbane
Thousand with Bst. 51b. in 1922 and with
lOst. 31b. in 1923. had another try on Satur-
day with 9st. 121 b., and found good backing
at 8 to 1. but he was not equal to it. The
3-to-l favorite, Fyrish Blue, ridden by Car-
ney, won for C. F. Murray after a stiff
fight with The Cooper (12 to 1) ; Chippewa
(5 to 1) was third and Seredale close up.
Fyrish Blue, who is a five-year-old bay mare
by Modesto —Azure Blue, had twice succeeded
in her previous starts at Albion Park, and
“horses for courses” is as well worth bearing
in mind in Queensland as elsewhere.

Mentellini, who won the A.R.C. City Han-
dicap in 1925 for S. S. Stephenson, won it
again for the same owner at Adelaide’s Vic-
toria Park on Saturday. The going was a
bit heavy, and that suited the Pistol—True
Friend gelding, who, when asked a question
by Jones, cut down the consistent Two geld-
ing Rou Miki—third, second, first and second
in four starts —and was a length and a half
clear at the finish. Eueda and All Quality,
three-year-olds like Rou Miki, shared third
place, and the seven furlongs were traversed
in Imin. 27^sec.; the divs. for £1 were £5 Bs.
and £2 16s. Nine-twelve proved too big a
burden for Gleamlight in the Adelaide Stakes
with the track as it was, but the Comedy
King colt, of whom South Australians have
formed a very high opinion, beat 16 of the
starters; everything, indeed, bar Nadeau (St.
Anton —Lodes), whose div. was £l6 7s. on
the £1 machine. And old Leahcim (St. Anton
—Quoin) showed the way home to Three
Kings, of Adelaide Cup celebrity, Cockina,
the S.A. St. Leger winner, and 14 others in
the Parkside Stakes, w.f.a., returning a
£7 3s. div. It is years since there were 17
runners in a w.f.a. race at Flemington or
Randwick.

Those punters who braved the bitter
blasts and drenching showers at Moonee
Valley on Saturday came away impressed
with Bernbanks’s ability over the battens.
It was some time since the Bernard gelding
bad shown any form worth talking of; but
out-jumping the opposition in the Federal
Hurdle, he took charge a mile from home
a nd won very easily by four lengths from
Coybeau (6 to 1) and the favorite, Nobility
(3 to 1). The winner, who was well backed
at 5 to 1 and better, carried lOst. 101 b., and
looks like turning out a payable proposition
this winter. He has lOst. 71b. in the Grand
National. The Commonwealth Steeple, 2
miles 8 chains, proved a soft thing—if any
steeple can beji soft thing—for the favorite,
Loch Eaton (7 to 2), who fenced very clev-
erly; Ancient Mariner (14 to 1) and Prince
Oklahoma (20 to 1) were next. The Eaton
Lad gelding, who likes the Valley course, car-
ried list. lib. and was ridden by George
Leonard, whose brother Frank had been suc-
cessful on Bernbanks, and who was a Westra-
lian Digger. Loch Eaton wall have 21b. less
in tlie.G.N. Steeple.
Yalwyne, who had run a good third hi.
Williamstown, was all the rage for the 12
furlongs Mt. Alexander Handicap, 7 to 4
being the final call. As it happened, the Val-
ais mare, always an uncertain sort, was in one
of her rotten moods and did not get near the
money; the 12-to-l shot Andy was first home
from the Jumpers’ Flat horse Disraeli (12
to 1) and Phocion (16 to 1) —a poor old trio,
but welcome to McShortodds. Elwood Fisher’s
stable is in form just now, and he had
something for his followers to bet on in the
Two-year-old Handicap; his Quantock geld-
ing Zanibar (9 to 2) jumped out smartly
and went right away from his field, of which
Bon Aire (4 to 1) and Dark Man (16 to 1),
a thing of Eric Connolly’s, were neai*est
when they dropped their hands . Speedy
Adjong (7 to 2) likewise led all the way in
the Iveilor Handicap, in -which Margaux (5
to 1) and Threeasta (10 to 1) were place-
getters. This mare has been a little gold-
mine to C. W. Wheeler.

A man of many interests was Henry Luke
White, of Belltrees, Scone (N.S.W.), dead
after a long illness. A nephew of the famous
James White, he naturally added racing to
the long list of his pursuits; on the death
of his uncle he and a brother took over the
Kirkham stud-mares. Perhaps the best thing
they bred and raced was the Carbine colt
Charge, winner of the 1896 A.J.C. Derby.
Another notable animal was Parapet, who
won the Doncaster for the yellow, white
hoops and yellow cap in 1900. In
days Golden Bronze, Golden Cello and
Golden Curio sported the well-known colors;
Golden Curio, indeed, was successful at
Rosehill a few weeks ago.

“The Gaffer”: That yarn in the papers
about an over-payment by a bookmaker re-
mjfnds me of the time “Soapy” Smiles and
myself made a book at St. George (Q.). It
was a bit of a come-down, for we had been on
the confidence lay. You know what I mean :
you give a cove your money to mind while
you walk down the street to show how you
trust him. Later on he gives you his, and
goes out for a walk. So do you, but you go
the other way, and keep going. Well, the
John who’d chased us out of Roma lobbed on
the course just as we were settling on the
fourth race. We’d had a good day, but
“Soapy” had some stuff in his bag I didn’t
care about the John seeing. “Soapy” spotted
him, too, and went all shaky. Then a cove
came through the mob and gave “Soapy” a
ticket. “Soapy” hands out a fat wad, and
the cove, after one look at it, cleared for his
natural. “Something wrong there,” I chips
in. “Why. the sheet says only 20 quid, and
you must have given him 200.” “Too right
1 did,” says Soapy, wiping the sweat off his
forehead. “But it was the 200 brummies we
useter trust th’ mugs with in th’ old game.
Th’ John’s beat this time, anyway.”
Footbrawl
Both the overseas Soccer sides now in Aus-
tralia were in action on Saturday. At
Adelaide, the Chinese had their second win.
defeating South Aus. by 4 goals to 2; in
Sydney, the Czecho-Slovaks suffered their
first defeat, a strong N.S.W. side scoring 5
goals to their 4, after a delightful exhibition
in which the visitors had a bit the better of
the play. Their only visible weakness was
in shooting for goal, wherein they failed to
reproduce the bullet-like accuracy of the
Englishmen. The Czechs’ footwork and short
passing were of high class, but, like the
Englishmen, they lack the pace of the Aus-
tralians. Bourke and McNaughton, the two
outside forwards, had played twice against
the visitors in the Test games at Adelaide and
Melbourne, and were well used to the oppo-
sition. Both were exceptionally good, while
Masters, at centre forward, and the two
N.S.W. backs, (.rum and Harris, were sound.
Cameron, at inside right, was übiquitous,
scoring 3 of the winners’ 5 goals. The star
of the Czech side was Prusek, at centre-half,
while S.ebjl, in goal, and Knizek, a fast and
clever forward, also impressed. The visitors
were unlucky to lose Kaspar, their star
back, soon after the game began.
“Naklioda”: A better place than the leader
pages of the dailies to study the Chinese
problem is the dressing-room of the Celestial
Soccer team now touring Australia. These
youths are all university or college boys or
graduates. A glance around the room shows
that there is as much difference between one
Chinaman and another as between a Finn
and an Italian. A pale young man with the
face of a Greek god run over by a steam-
roller stands head and shoulders over a dark
youngster with the. features favored by Aus-
tralian cartoonists. The one is from Chihli,
in the north : the other from Kuangtung, in
the south. Shapes aren’t the only difference.

I DREAMED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dreamed—and dear the dream to me
As ever mortal had—
Of goodly wads of £ s. d.,
Won on" this truly noble gee
Or that outstanding prad.
I dreamed of tipsters shrewd and cute
Who picked ’em without fail;
Of betting brisk and resolute,
Of gaping crowds, astounded, mute,
Save for a bookie’s wail.
I dreamed of careless “ponies” flung
On winners by the score;
Of terror Israel’s ranks among,
The misery of Maclsaacs stung,
Of bags that bulged no more.
I dreamed of ladies, big and blonde,
The wives of those that lay,
Who from the depths of their despond
Dredged diamond rings and finery fond
To help their husbands pay.
And then —heigh-ho, that dream so fair
So little should connote !
With all the courage of despair
I took (again pieds-a-terre)
A ticket on the Tote!

security from
disastrous fires
For many years fire appliances capable
of dealing with fires of an ordinary nature,
such as m ght occur in offices, have been
in general use, but the widespread in-
troduction of petrol and fuel oil saw the
advent of a fire risk demanding a new
extinguishing medium which would, in
addition, be adequate for dealing with
fires involving inflammable liquids. After
lengthy research, the last decade saw the
introduct on of the FOAMITE method
of F re Protection with portable equip-
ment and fixed installations producing a
fire extinguishing medium (Firefoam)
which met this demand.
Fiercely blazing petrol, paint, tar —
which defy other extinguishing methods
—are easily smothered under Firefoam.
Ordinary fires die instantly. The foam
not only puts out the fire but prevents re-
ignition.

Shanghai spoke the Shanghai dialect to a
college mate who came from Fukien, but they
were both using a foreign language, just as
an Australian might employ French in Paris
to communicate with a Swede. With some,
pidgin English is the only common tongue.
But politically they are all Nationalists, and
as serious about it as they are about foot-
ball, which, like Nationalism, was taught
them by the British.

The visit of a fine team from the Maori-
land universities has been a feature of the
Rugby Union season. Sydney Uni. brilliantly
won the first of the three matches, 31-12:
but in the second tussle on Saturday the
Blacks had fairly shaken dowm, and they
bore away the honors of a great game, 15

minutes. I’ll hang on.”
to 11. Their forwards, after their taste of
Sydney’s speed three days before, kept the
game very tight, and gave the blue-and-gold
backs little room to move. Backed up well
by a powerful back division, they had the
game apparently home and dried with a
9-0 lead at three-quarter time. But Sydney
came with a great burst, and added 11 points
in as many minutes. Two more tries by
Maoriland, the last by All Black Alley,
clinched the game for the Maorilanders.
Lindsay, a big and speedy three-quarter,
with Keegan and Alley in the vanguard, did
good service for the tourists. Full-back
Ross had a stiff testing against the rushing
Black pack, but answered every call; Lam-
port, at scrum-half, also came out of a
gruelling ordeal with flying colors.
In the competition games, Manly lost its
maiden certificate for the season by beating
Western Suburbs, 20-19. Y.M.C.A. just
scraped home from Eastern Suburbs, 15-13,
Ben Egan, the Waratah candidate, playing
finely for East at centre. Ilandwick’s for-
wards surprised all hands by beating the
renowned Glebe-Balmain pack; but the G.-B.
backs, headed by Wallace, helped their side
to a 12-6 victory.
E. Gordon Shaw, who lias been elected
manager of the N.S.W. Rugby Union team
to tour England, is a Monaro pastoralist,
once a bank manager, w 7 ho has put in a
lot of hard work and good money to keep
the Union game going in South Monaro.
He was in the running for selection in the
last Union team which went to England, in
1908; in that year he played centre-three-
quarter for Combined Country and Metro-
polis against the Anglo-Welsh tourists. His
election will do the Union game in the
country a lot of good, and is in accord with
the Union’s policy of giving the country
side of the game full recognition.

Very rough was the Rugby League match
between St. George and Newtown at Sydney
Cricket Ground, when the ■ former won by
23 to 5. Fists and feet were flying from
the beginning, but the second half, which
St. George began with a lead of 20 points,
was ferocious. That the referee sent only
one man off suggests that he suffered from
an embarrassment of riches in the matter
of candidates for the dressing-room. Veteran
Frank Burge did well for the Saints, scoring
three tries. South Sydney had an exercise
gallop at the expense of North Sydney, 26
to 7; the fast and heavy Lapham scored
another four tries. Eastern Suburbs had

A wintry Satur-

f o r Melbourne’s

Footscray surprised itself, and nearly
everyone else, by keeping South Melbourne
on the run and defending its own
goal superbly, so that in the last quarter,
when the Red-and-Whites had the wind, they
were too tired to use it, losing finally by 1
goal—’Scray, 55 points ; South, 49. St. Kilda
maintained its reputation for being almost
invincible on its own ground; by dint of
strenuous play and sure kicking it handed
Essendon another defeat, the ’Dons’ fourth
this season ; Saints, 91 points; ’Don, 82. The
Richmond Tigers, after barely holding their
own against North Melbourne through the
first half, swarmed all over their opponents
in the second and wound up with 83 points
to North’s 38. Carlton defeated Hawthorn,
with 96 points to 52, in a sloppy, scrambling
game; and Collingwood gave a choice but
one-sided exhibition of ’ball in a collision with
its old rivals and neighbors of Fitzroy. Gor-
don Coventry booted 11 goals, and the tally
in all was 18 euals 15 behinds to ’Roy’s 9

“Ruckex-”: Australian-rules football in
N.S.W. is reserving its energies till the latter
half of the season. In that period the State
team will take part in the inter-State series
at Melbourne in August; before that the
Queensland XVIII, on its way down to Mel-
bourne, will play the N.S.W. side. Leo
O’Connor, Queensland’s cricket captain, who
is president of Queensland Football League,
will be manager and delegate to the Austra-
lian Football Council. Sydney will’ get its
share of inter-State football when a South
Aus. team plays the pick of N.S.W. on Sept.
24 and Oct. 1.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
It goes without saying that an American
negro—Joe Hall this time —-was one of the
principals at the Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day night; but. perhaps in deference to S. M.
Herald, a white bruiser was pitted against
him. The paleface was Sid Buxton, an
English lightweight, and the bookmakers
thought so little of him that they made
the coon a 4-to-l-on favorite. They were saved
from paying out only by the surprising
verdict that gave the well-beaten black a
draw. Buxton won by a wide margin, and
it is safe to say that the bagmen were the
only members of the onlooking crowd that
agreed with Wallis. The unheralded English-
man sailed into Hall in every round. His
left hand was continually in the midst of
the black features. Though Hall fought
with cool confidence in the first few rounds,
and with fierce desperation later, he never
once made Sid wilt or refuse to engage in
the most furious rally. No matter how'
hard he was hit, Buxton did not appear to
be aware of it and always retaliated in kind.
Many watchers regretted audibly that Bux-
ton hadn’t a hard punch. But it was Hall
who was the first to show blood, to be
knocked back the furthest, and to clinch or
bolt for safety. The darkie was several
times rebuked for butting, holding and hit-
ting, low' punches and the like. Once Bux-
ton scornfully refused to “shake” when the
black tendered a shallow' apology for a flag-
rant foul. The crowd cheered the game and
clever Cockney, and hooted Hall and the
referee, as they left the ring.

“0.T.” : Mick Dooley’s scrap with Paddy
Slavin was a bit different from his furious
affairs with Goddard (B. 26/5/’27). Slavin
came over from Melbourne fit and full of
fight. Mick, who Foley said had trained
“up the mountains” (Woolloomooloo, he
meant), entered the ring with his bingey
hanging over his belt in a flaccid roll. Paddy’s
scowl was more pronounced than usual, and
as he advanced with that peculiar action of
his, putting the left heel down first and com-
ing over on it, instead of sliding the whole
foot forward or tapping the toes first, he
looked enough to scare any poor untrained
pug. Dooley led a light left. Slavin’s tre-
mendous right flashed across, and Mick hit
the floor and lay quivering till counted out.
“Dammit, ’e needn’t have ’it. me so ’ard, ’
wheezed Mick, afterwards. “’E knew I
couldn’t "a" lasted more’n a cuppla rounds.”
And he tenderly felt the egg at the back of
his left ear.

An Anglo-Bussian argument at Melbourne
Stadium, with Sam Clapham (12st. 101 b.)
and A 1 Karasick (12st. 41b.) representing
the disputing nations, resulted in a complete
victory for ,T. Bull, the Yorksliireman gain-
ing two smashing falls. It was Sam’s first
appearance since last winter. The Russian
was kept so busy getting out of trouble that
he had little chance of taking the initiative,
but his spectacular methods of escape
appealed more to the crowd than the sheer
strength employed by Sam. That stolid Eng-
lander had A 1 “all but” in the second round
with a perfectly-applied figure-four scissors,
but the Bussian plunged and kicked until
he broke free. Tempers were lost in the next
round, and game little referee Bridges evoked
cheers by liopning in between the two angry
masses of meat and dragging them apart till
they cooled off. After that Sam’s prodigious
strength was too much for Karasick. In
attempting his headlock in the fourth the Mus-
covite was whirled shoulder-high with a
crotch hold, and hurled with crushing force
on the mat. For many seconds after his

shoulders had been pinned he was crawling
around in circles wondering what it was all
about. When lie came up for the next

even more fervor than before.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Poached Egg” : Australia’s chance of lift-
ing the British amateur golf title vanished
into thin air when our amateur champion,
lefthander L. Nettlefold, was outed in the
sixth round by a Dr. Tweddell, 4 up and 3
to play. The medico is English-born, but
was educated at Aberdeen, which may account
for his being the slowest athlete ever seen
outside a chess tourney. In this match he
took so much time to consider his shots that
the three following matches were held up,
from hole to hole. He had a bit of luck in
holing out a 15-yard ch'ip shot for 2 at the
11th, and a missed putt of six inches at
the 14th made him dormy. A half at the
next hole gave him the match. In the semi-
final, the deliberate one defeated Iloger
Wetliered, who once lost the amateur cham-
pionship by treading on his ball, 4 and 3. In
the final the medico fairly romped homo,
beating D. Landon, a Londoner, by 7 and 6.
Young Nettlefold’s performance is none. the
less a brilliant one. Bobby Jones, America's
golfing hero, cut nothing like so good a figure
in his first appearance in the big English
event, which he later won.

“Ploughman” : Brisbane golfers are ask-
ing heatedly when the long-promised muni-
cipal golf links are to arrive. At the. Greater
Brisbane Council elections two years ago the
Golf Association asked candidates for a
pledge that the municipal-links project would
receive their support on election. All gave
the usual promises and forgot them in the
usual manner. Now the council is being
tackled again, and a good beginning has
been made by inducing Lud Mayor Jolly
to join a golf club. Sydney’s experiment
at Moore Park should' furnish proof enough
of the success awaiting such a scheme, for
already a second municipal course out National
Park way is to be begun. There are plenty
of suitable and inexpensive areas within
■easy reach of Brisbane proper, and the sum
needed for a start would not exceed a few
hundreds.

“Slow Back”: Twenty-six Maoriland
golfers of both sexes have invaded Sydney
to take part in the N.S.W. championships
and the Kirk-Wiudeyer Gup competition.
The All Blacks’ side for the Cup comprises
A. D. Duncan, of Wellington, four times
open and 11 times amateur champion of the
Shivery Isles. T. H. Horton, of Masterton,
another champion, and Leo Quinn, of Eltham
Club, Auckland, who has also won the
amateur laurels. The fourth player, hailing
from Otago, would naturally bear a name
like Kenneth Boss, and lie is also a top-
notcher by repute. Ivo Whitton heads a
strong Victorian team, and Queensland is
also well represented. The other States
have not sent teams.
* * * *
“Bailing Spoon”: In these days of plus-
fours, one never sees the scarlet coat which
used to distinguish the golfing “head.” A
Sydney journal states that these scarlet
coats ‘were sported to warn casual wayfarers
that there- was golf afoot, and that danger
might be apprehended from the flying ball.
Not so. The garment was originally the
insignium of the club captain who had won
his way to that eminence, as his primeval
forebears might have done, in another sense,
by being handier with a
club than the others of the
tribe. The wearing of it
gradually spread to other
first-class players in the club.
In the writer’s boyhood it
was the usual thing In see
half a dozen or so of the
red jackets dotted about a
thronged British course.
There probably isn’t one left
to-day in the wide world.

“Gutty” : As to golf acci-
dents and lawsuits (B.
19/5/’27), let us consider an
English case of years ago.
It cropped up shortly after
the new patent “cored” golf-
ball came in. Some makes
had a central capsule, con-
taining a liquid solution, and
round this was wrapped the
rubber thread which is a
usual feature of the internal
economy of the modern golf-
ball. One of these was “loft-
ed” over a railway-line by
a winter golfer; it dropped
down the stove-pipe of a
fettler's hut beside the line.
Hearing the noise, the fettler
opened the door of his little
stove and bent down to in-
vestigate. As he did so, the
ball burst, with the result
that he was blinded perma-
nently. In this case also, an
action for damages succeeded, in spite of the
amazing coincidence of flukes which brought
about the accident.

“Cross Swing"’: There can be no doubt
that vice-regality has its privileges. I have
been reading how Governor Tom Bridges
opened an Adelaide golf club. The reporter
for the Court Circular or Government
Gazette or whatever it was issued a bul-
letin to the effect that the Governor, in
driving off from the first tee, “hit a good
length ball a little out to the right.” Only
a few Saturdays ago a friend of mine who
did exactly the same thing in a Sydney
club competition was described in the press
as “slicing his first horribly into the rough.”

“Cut Shot”: Suzanne Lenglen has not
taken long to induce that fed-up feeling in
C. Q Pyle, who lured the French marvel
from the strait and cashless path of amateur-
ism. Not only is Pyle off Suzanne. He
bars the whole boiling of his professional
team; they want all the money, it seems.
Pyle offered Suzanne £lO,OOO and 50 per
cent, of the gate to tour Europe, and she
turned it down. A fragmentary cable stated
the other day that one Baldwin, who had
undertaken the . tour, had returned to
America, stating that it hadn’t even paid
expenses. Nevertheless, Suzanne still intends
to run her show in opposition to the Wimble-
don tournament, under promotor C. B. Coch-
ran’s auspices.
“Amateur Pro.”: Another of those skew-
bald exhibitions, so popular these days, took
place on Saturday, when ,T. O. Anderson,
now a “pro.,” and young Jack Crawford,
N.S.W. champion, opposed each other at Gul-
gong. Anderson won after a tough battle,
the scores being 4—6, 7—5 and 6 —2. In
a doubles game Crawford and L. Norris
outed Anderson and Cross, 6—B, 6 —4. Those
who acclaim Crawford as a Davis Cup
hope look like being on a winner. Whether
it is advisable to run him off his legs by
practically continuous tennis, here, there and
everywhere, is another matter.

“15-30”: Britain’s elimination from the
Davis Cup in the first tie with Denmark is a
sad commentary on the present state of Eng-
lish tennis. Time was when the Dohertys
dominated the white oblong with their some-
what sedate methods of offence and defence.
In 1912. when Australia became a factor,
through the vigorous stroking of Wilding and
the subtle place-playing of Brookes, Britain
could still find a Parke whose curious run-
ning drive was more effective against Brookes
than all the back-spin bullet services that
the Americans could devise. Parke left the
scene, and Major Kingscote’s pretty back-
hand seemed likely to keep the old flag flying;
but Kingscote lacked youth and intensity.
With the possible exception of Turnbull,
Britain hasn’t had a player of international
rank since.
Car and Cycle
“Trembler”: In the old days, when a man
turned up at the office with two black eyes
and a broken nose, his explanation to ribald
Inquirers was that he had been chopping
wood. In this year of grace he merely says
that he has gone through the windscreen of a
car, and carries on in virtuous serenity.
These reflections follow on perusal of the
statistics of America’s motor casualties in
3926. There were 700,000 of these, and 65
per cent, of them were due to windscreen
bumps or to similar contact with broken
glass, flying and otherwise.
* * * #
“Valve Lifter”: The motorists I came
upon the other night were cursing briskly.
They had parked their cars (close on a
dozen) in a lane while they attended a
function in a near-by hall, and on attempt-
ing to restart them found in every case that
something had gone wrong with the works.
Presently someone thought of the little gar-
age round the corner, and came back with
two youths, who in a short time had several
cars moting merrily. Water on the mag-
neto or the sparking-plugs or some other
gadget was the young men’s diagnosis of the
trouble. There had been some rain that
night, but hardly enough, I thought, to incon-
venience any car; and something in their
modus operandi struck me as being strange.
While one busied himself under the bonnet
the other seemed to find interest at the rear
of the car, inspecting the petrol tank or the
back tyres. Failing to see any connection
between a jibbing engine and the pressure in
a tyre I wandered to the back of the last
car in the row, whose owner, tired of wait-
ing his turn, was trying to get his engine
to do its job. Just as I got there the engine
spluttered, coughed violently, and took .up its
work at the same moment as I received a
sharp smack on the calf of the leg from
something soft. Furtively I examined the
missile, and then moved homewards, ponder-
ing on the enterprise of those youths. By
sealing each car’s exhaust-pipe with potato
they had netted a couple of pounds.

“Bouragi”: The Bland electro-mechanical
valve is an Australian invention of import-
ance. It replaces cams, push-rods and
rockers for valve opening and closing, which
it does electrically. The old system opens
a valve gradually, or comparatively so; this
results in a loss of engine efficiency. The
Bland apparatus gives a sudden opening and
a closing of valves, enabling full employment
of exhaust and inlet strokes. Solenoids, mag-
netised and demagnetised by a rotary dis-
tributor. give the necessary movement to
the valves. The inventor has returned from
England, where manufacturers have tested
the invention and decided to adopt the prin-
ciple in a trial plant.
* *
“The Juice”: Though we all use petrol
nowadays, some of us for cleaning last year’s
suits and others for propelling this season's
Rolls-Royces, not many can give offhand the
origin of the name. It is not chemical jar-
gon, but trade argot, and was coined by
one F. R. Simms for the product of Careless,
Capel and Leonard, the first firm in England
to manufacture commercial petrol. The
Americans call the stuff gasoline, but the
English name is used everywhere else.
“Hotham”: America, with prospects of a
petrol shortage before its eyes, has been
conducting experiments with strange motor
fuels, and it is announced that successful
trials have been made with grain-dust from
the great wheat silos. This dust, in air-
suspension, has long been recognised as
highly inflammable, as many explosions _in
flour-mills and silos have proved, but nothing
has been said yet of the manner of harnessing
it to a motor-car. If the experimenters can
go a step farther, and rope in dust of all
descriptions, the great problem of the inter-
nal-combustion engine will be solved, for
Australia, at least. Melbourne during the
north-w r ind season will become a fuel-produc-
ing depot for the Continent, while Bourke
and Wilcannia will rise to prosperity again
on the wings of their duststorms. Better
still, the small-family car-owner can indulge
in his week-end on the fuel that Mary Ann
has failed to remove from the furniture since
the last outing.

“Bouragi” : British cars were conspicuous
in the N.S.W. Royal Auto Club’s reliability
touring contest to Mudgee. The winner, C.
S. Sherwood, drove a 1944-c.c. Star, and the
car in second place was a 1645-c.c. Riley,
driven by A. R. Johns. A Chrysler 3581
c.c. was third, and a Yauxhall 2897 c.c.
fourth. Points were very close, the Star win-
ning by only 1.2. Class A, up to 1500 c.c.,
was won by a Bugatti, with a Singer second;
class B, to 3000 c.c., by the Star above-
mentioned, and class C, over 3000 c.c., by
W. A. Nock’s Chrysler, which came third
in the outright contest.
The caravan outfit pictured here is the Brockway-Hansford stock motor-float for
transporting racehorses, etc. In Sydney it is becoming a formidable competitor of the trams,
and its passengers have picked up a fair percentage of wins on arrival at their desti-
nations. Six of 12 horses carried from Randwick to Warwick Farm recently won
their races, without reckoning places. At a Rosehill meeting the caravanners collected
four races out of six. The idea is am old one—the horse-drawn van was used in England
nearly a hundred years ago—but the addition of motor traction has improved it out
of sight.
“C.Q.” : A baby Citroen completed another
extraordinary feat when W. A. Marshall and
C. Morgan trundled into Melbourne one day
last week atop of the tiny ’bus, having gone
to Darwin via the overland telegraph route
and returned by way of Cloncurry in 42
days. The car carried nearly twice its own
weight and did 55 miles of “desert” to the
gallon.

“Chevroford”: A Melbourne motor hog
established a record in offences when he ran
down a jinker. He was fined fl on each of
five counts: driving while drunk, without a
license, with no lights, on the wrong side
of the road, and so as to make a disturb-
ance in a public place. One of the few
offences he didn’t commit was lese-majeste.
Miscellaneous
“Backwoodsman”: Auckland (M.L.)
claims the oldest properly constituted bowl-
ing-club in Australasia; it dates from 1861.
But N.S.W. had bowling contests as far back
as Governor Macquarie’s days, when the
Woolpack Inn at Parramatta boasted a
green, though there was perhaps no “duly
constituted” club. However, Auckland’s claim
to another distinction will not be disputed.
Its club’s president wears a gold chain round
his neck, by virtue of his office, on cere-
monial occasions. Each new president has
to add a link to the chain, which is assuming
alarming proportions.

“Glebe”: That reference (B. 28/4/’27) to
digging up of a S’African golf course by mal-
contents reminds me. When the Victoria
Park Bowling Club, which has lifted the
1927 N.S.W. pennant, laid its first green in
the Sydney park from which it takes its
name, it had a similar opposition to face.
Some of the residents objected to the
“encroachment,” though the club had received
due authority to lay its green, and dug up
the turf by night. It was relaid several
times, and as often torn up again. Finally,
special pickets kept the objectors away until
the inevitable was gloomily accepted, and the
bowlers were left in peace.

“Aby Aitch” : “Whiz” (B. 19/5/’27) con-
siders the greyhound the fastest thing on
legs. So did 1 until two years ago, when I
was bringing, among other Central Aus-
tralian animals and reptiles, some kangaroo-
mice to Melbourne. While changing trains
at Port Augusta I missed two of the tiny
creatures. Presently I saw them on the
station-platform, right in front of a grey-
hound, which immediately became interested.
One little chap was out of sight in a
moment; the other scooted up the centre of
the platform, hardly seeming to touch the
ground, the hound full-belt after him. They
started pretty well together from one end
of the station. The mouse disappeared over
the other end, with the dog, though running
hard, little more than half-way.
Epping (N.S.W.) racecourse, till recently
sacred to the “Red Hots,’ saw another sight
on Saturday night, when greyhound-racing
after an electrically-driven artificial hare
was publicly staged for the first time in
Australia. The dogs entered heartily into
the spirit of the game, and, as the “hare”
was kept by the electric control always a
few yards in the lead, got no chance of
finding out that they were being grossly
deceived. The principal event was a Puppy
Stakes, of four courses, first and second in
each to compete in the final. The final,
worth £25, went to Bquick, winner of the
third course; the time for the round of the
two-furlong track was given as 28 3-ssec.
With open betting the game would probably
catch on, but there are legal difficulties in
the way and the reconstruction of the Gov-
ernment will not tend to remove them.
“Altcar”: An incident of a trial spin
previous to Saturday’s meeting recalled .Tor-
roeks’s dictum that of all daft brutes a
greyhound is the daftest. The mechanical
hare was set in motion, and several dawgs
were slipped after it. One of them, noticing
that puss wasn’t running straight, took a
short-cut across the ground to intercept her.
As the lady has a steel frame under her
skin, and was travelling about 40 m.p.h.,
the intelligent but misguided hound literally
lost his head over her. The moral appar-
ently is that if you must chase fast females
you’d better keep a respectable distance be-
hind ’em.

Standing the strain of a prolonged tourney
better than young Purdy. Spencer Crakan-
thorp is once more N.S.W. chess champion.

“Slide”: The inter-University race for the
Oxford-Cambridge cup will be rowed on the
Nepean River (N.S.W.) on Saturday, over
a three-mile course finishing at Penrith
bridge. For the first time since the race
was instituted all six Australian States will
be represented. The crews have been quar-
tered in and near Penrith. Tasmania, South
Aus. and Queensland are using boats bor-
rowed from the Sydney G.P.S. sheds; West-
ralia has requisitioned the shell in which the
State crew won the King's cup at Hobart;
Victoria and Sydney will have their own
craft. Sydney, which Avon at Franklin (Tas.)
last year, is fancied by local watermen, but
rowing form is so good in Perth that the
SAvan River boat must be reckoned danger-
ous. This year’s departure in holding the
race on the straight and sheltered Nepean
course, instead of the Parramatta's crowded
waterway, will probably be followed in future
by other regatta organisers, since the übiquit-
ous motor has solved transportation prob-
lems.
“Shell”: In addition to the eight-oar race
on the Nepean there will be a sculling race
over a two-mile course between Melbourne
and Sydney Uni. youths. Though once a
favorite course for scullers, the Nepean has
not seen a race of any importance since
George Towns rowed Canadian Eddie Dur-
nan in 1907, and won. It was on the Nepean
that Hanlan made his first Australian
appearance in a championship, Avhen he beat
Elias Laycoek in 1884. Three years later
Bill Beach beat Hanlan there in the last
meeting of the famous pair.

“Zero”: An ingenious explanation was
brushed aside by a hard-hearted beak at
Albury, when a cafe proprietor was fined
for permitting roulette to be played on his
premises. It avus that the defendant, who
had once been to Monte Carlo, was trying,
conjointly Avith friends, to work out a sys-
tem to beat the roulette tables, and papers
covered with number sequences w T ere pro-
duced in proof. The magistrate probably
knew that all confirmed players keep a
written check of number and color. Maybe
he had been to Monte Carlo himself. Yet
a lot of people with brains and worldly
knowledge to boot have dabbled in systems;
Hiram Maxim and Labouchere, for example.
Invariably the system crashes sooner or
later. The only system for making money
by gambling is one worked to death on
racecourses. It consists in finding as many
mugs as there are starters in a
a difficult job for a tradesman—and giving
each a different certainty, collecting a divi-
dend from the ultimate winner. And there
are catches, even here. The mug may back
something else, or when you arrive for your
whack he may turn out to be Scotch.

“Billy th’ Goose”: I see them Rock’amp-
ton innercents is gettin’ a bit more worldly.
A feAv days ago th’ papers ’ad it th’ stooards
at tli’ Rocky show ’ad carpeted ’arf a dozen
of th’ race-goat owners an’ put ’em away

kids was shovin’ first-division goats inter
third-division flutters —I’m talkin’ of reel
goats, mind yer, not th’ ponies—an’ ringin’
in others under different names. ’Orse-racin’
’as its lower levels, and we all know th’
strong of th’ macaronies an’ th’ red-’ots.
but w’en it comes to goat-racin’ kids, it's
time f’r th’ talent t’ stand back. Every-
one knows th’ tale of ’ow me ole pal Stepper
Davis was double-crossed at Richmond ’ill
goat races on Th’ Towers. There weren’t
many men or women ’oo could say they’d
beaten Stepper, but ’e was a soft snap
to them infants. I don’t envy tli’ Rocky
stooards their job, if they’re goin’ t’ keep
goat-racin’ on the show programmes. Tli'
only way ter identify a goat is by smellir'
Tm. Th’ paper says they’s 60 or 70 goats

—an’ even stooards ’as some right ter per-

“Shrewsbury”; The Maoriland cricketers
in England, after a fine start against the
Marylebone club which brought forth paeans
of praise for their batting, have struck a
trot of wet weather and rain-spoilt pitches.
Still, if they have made no big scores since
the M.C.C. game, they have succeeded in
keeping the other sides pretty quiet. Beaten
by a small margin in their matches against
Essex, Middlesex and Cambridge, they had
bad luck when rain robbed them of a win
against the Army, for they needed only 61.
with eight wickets in hand. Blunt has been
the outstanding success so far, doing well
with bat and ball alike. Dacre's batting
and the bowling of Bernau and Merritt have
also made a good impression.

Generals and colonels and mayors in scar-
let and gold or leaf-brown khaki; captains
of the navy tied up in gold braid ; a bunch
of debs, showing an unusual line in long,
white kid gloves (possibly in compliment
to our punctilious G.-G., to whom they made
their bob) and pretty Margaret Osborne's
sparkling new engagement-ring were the
ginger in the sweet of the United Service
ball at the Wentworth last week. It was
the swaggah public function in a crowded
seven days; and the Army and the Navy
can be complimented on once again staging
ade luxe performance. The G.-G. and Lady
Stonehaven arrived at half-past nine, and
were greeted by a fanfare of trumpets, a
roll of drums, the National Anthem, the
war-lords of the United Service Institute
and Chief Justice Street. Then the vast
concourse, feeling that all that honor de-
manded had been accomplished, sank to their
gilded chairs, while the vice-re’s were cosily
surrounded by the upholstery of the vice-
regal box. Near them were Colonel and
Mrs. Spain, the Major-General Bruche couple
and Captain and Airs. Robins. Lady Stone-
haven was like a slim, bronze statuette in
her fringes and fur; and Airs. Spain's all-
embracing shawl might have come direct
from the castanet- and matador-infested dis-
tricts of old Seville. A night-sky effect
was gained by Airs. Street’s black ninon
over deep blue, and Airs. Robins sprayed
sea-green georgettes with crystal. The Com-
mander Leo Quicks were one of the good-
looking couples of the night, and tall secre-
tary Daniell’s wife was a demonstrator of
the never-failing attractions of black. Black
lace and flame-poppies were the heady mix-
ture chosen by Airs. Harry Dransfield.
Old bachelor squatter Stirton made a will,
and then, opening his heart, added various
after-thoughts. By one of these his secre-
tary, Aliss Clay, a daughter of the old doctor
who looked after the ills of Hornsby in
mother’s day, receives a nice little gift of
£lO,OOO. Perhaps greater surprises were
waiting for two members of the staff of the
AVarrigal Club. In the cloistered calm of
this old Alacquarie-street institution Air.
Stirton used to spend much of his time dis-
cussing with fellow-squatters the vagaries of
sheep and horses—he had himself been very
successful with both —and when codicil , day
came round he remembered the two attend-
ants who had done most to smooth the way
for him. To the housekeeper there comes
accordingly £l5O a year for her lifetime;
and for the imperturbable Japanese head-
waiter who in the AVarrigal is a hundred
things besides head-waiter there is £5O a
year.
This conjunction of wool and the AVarrigal
recalls the story that used to be told about
the origin of the club. There was a time, so
it was said, when squatters with large over-
drafts thought they felt the gimlet eyes of
every banker-member upon them if they ever
hit it up at all in the Union Club. It was
the day, too, when a squatter had great diffi-
culty in managing without his banker’s help;
a day, too, when the slieep-grower, afflicted
with drought, rabbits and a wretched wool-
market, felt more in need than ever he did
of whatever comfort he could draw out of
life with a corkscrew. Hence there was, so
to speak, a bitter contest between Gimlet
and Corkscrew; and, as you might expect,
Corkscrew won; a new club for squatters
was set up in Alacquarie-street; and bankers
were cordially invited to stay outside. But
that was long ago. To-day, perhaps because
no squatter is any longer afraid to meet his
banker face to face, the latter is admitted,
though still he has to show liis connection
with the land.
The vault-like gloom that lies in layers
About the banqueting-hall of the Australia by
morning was dissipated one day last week as
early as eleven b.v the clock. A half-hour
later so blithe and free were the goings-on that
except for the hats and frocks of the gather-
ing a looker-in might have thought his wrist-
watch was racing towards midnight instead
of boon. The party was the farewell of the
Country AVomen’s Association to Dame Alice
Chisholm and the wife of Australia’s new
High Commissioner Ryrie, • To both the Gen-
eral's lady and the Dame who kept the Kan-
tara cupboard full admirers had brought such
piled-up sweetness of carnations, pansies, mig-
nonette and roses that the guests-of-honor
were soon almost hidden behind the flowers
that banked their table. AVhile a friendly
billy pretended to boil amid the decorations,
Mrs. Jimmie Ashton opened the devotions
with a toast to Sir Dudley and Lady de
Chair; and while beakers were being drained
the orchestra tuned up in “Rule Britannia”
and “For. She’s a Jolly Good Fellow!” Mrs.
Gordon AVesche then produced reasons for a
like honor being paid to the two guests, point-
ing out how ideal the new ambassadress in
London would be, and telling once again the
evergreen story of the other’s splendid work
for Billjim. The Colin Venn, 11. C. Mclntyre
and Ashton matrons were hostesses of the
farewelling; and in addition to the Vice-
reine, important people present were George
Fuller’s lady, Lady Poynter, Mrs. Philip
Street and Mrs. Earle Page.
As popular with surgeons as an expensive
operation is the at-home held every year by
the nurses of St. Vincent’s. So the medical
brotherhood turned up in force again to see
the pretty pros, doing turns from the latest
musical-comedy successes and acting like the
front row of a leg show might if, instead of
stalled admirers, the front seats were occu-
pied by bishops and nuns of the higher
orders. The Police Band added its music to
the night, and the audience, which packed
out the big quadrangle—and a nippy spot it
proved in spite of the awnings—and must
have represented some hundreds of pounds at
30s. per chair, later on foregathered for
supper in a big marquee. Here amidst the
angelica and the trifle, ice-cream filled the
most unexpected of exteriors. There were
those who even darkly hinted that owing to
the cold in the atmosphere the ice-cream had
been offered in a job lot. Certainly there
was enough to feed an expedition to the
uppermost Amazon.
For size and bouncing fun, the annual
dance of the Lewisham Old Boys w T ould be
very hard to beat. This re-union’s gaiety
bubbled in every corner and cranny of the
Wentworth, and Mrs. S. A. Burns, who
was one of the principal reasons for the
night’s success, bore, as the symbol of tin'
committee’s gratitude, a posy of many colors.
On her table the two blues of the College
contrasted gaily with the gold of the wattle
and the Iceland poppies that bloomed there-
on. Her party was one of the largest, and
included several of the representatives of
other R.C. colleges. President of the Old
Boys’ Union E. J. Buckley had beckoned
a bunch of the prettiest girls to his table,
and Dr Manion’s board was presided over
by his best girl—his mother, who hostessed
in black georgette, thickly sown with sequins.

No more at a gathering of Mussolini’s com-

figure be seen. It was missed when during
the week the Dante Alighieri Society made
merry at the Ambassadors and welcomed the
handsome flag from the Dante brotherhood
in Florence. The red. white and green of
the gift is of thick silk, and Italy’s coat-of-
arms is embroidered on the white panel.
Arthur Rickard’s lady, in delicately-mixed
silver grey and flame raiment, presented the
banner to the Italian Vice-Consul, Cavalier
Carosi, who in turn, to the accompaniment of
a speech whose vowels sounded like liquid
fire, draped it over the table at which the
president of the society, Captain Baccarini,
sat with Mrs. Baccarini, the Mayoral Mos-
tyns and Town Clerk Layton. The hostess’s
Madonna blue and silver lame toned in with
the ivory georgettes weighted with sequins on
which the Mayoress fastened the badge of
the society presented to her as well as to the
Rickard lady. A French party over which
the banking Spitzer pair presided included
French Consul-General and Mrs. Nettiment,
she in ivory lace over black taffeta.
Whisked suddenly from the roar and rush
of George-street, 1927, to the music and
romance-steeped atmosphere in which Men-
delssohn composed his Wedding March, the
guests of one afternoon party last week felt
a bit like Alice stepping through the looking-
glass. The happy idea sprang in the minds
of Mrs. Hepburn and Miss Hoskins as a
farewell to Mrs. Doak Rice, who went north
last week. The little trial theatre of art
films on the roof of City Tattersall’s was
the scene, and here to the music of a tiny
orchestra incidents in the life of Mendelssohn
and the American Stephen Foster were
screened. Afterwards tea was served on the
roof, which holds one of the most blooming
gardens on the city’s housetops.
This is Mrs. Defosse Badgery, better
known as artist Dorothy Wall. An interest-
ing little show of her black-and-white sketches
and water-colors is at present attracting
attention at Swain’s. Many of these are
illustrations for
a “Story of
the Bee,” writ-
ten by Mrs.
Wall some
time ago, but
which she has
no w decided
not to print.
She has
already one
book published
by Harraps to
her credit. It
is a story for
kiddies, an d
she is both the
tale-teller and
the illustrator.
Mrs. Badgery’s
sketches are
also the
charming ac-
c o m p animent
of “The Crys-
tal Bowl.” The artist is the wife of Captain
Defosse Badgery, Australia’s third aviator
and captain of the first Australian Flying
Squadron in Egypt.
This year City Tattersall’s Club is indulg-
ing in a ball at the Palais on July 19, and
the Children’s Hospital is to be the richer
thereby. Last winter the Club members
combined in one big jamboree, and the result
was an £B2O cheque for Prince Alfred’s. The
G.-G. Stonehavens are patronising the affair,
and Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair will be
among the quick-steppers.
Eighty-nine years ago David Jones took
down the shutters for the first time at the
George-street shop, and waited anxiously
enough, no doubt, for his first customer.
The other night 2000 dancers, almost
all of them employed by the old Syd-
ney fluff firm, arrived at the Moore Park
Palais to celebrate the entry of still another
smiling year. Original and carefully-worked-
out fancy costumes were sported by hun-
dreds of young things, and director Charles
Lloyd Jones’s special prize of 10 guineas
went to a charming “Miss David Jones,
1838.” The firm moves into its new premises
in Elizabeth-street early next year.
The medical Throsbys, of North Sydney,
blessed another daughter and sped her on
the road to matrimony last week. She was
second daughter Peggy, and in ivory satins
that had a mediaeval cut about the long,
tight bodice and the long, full skirt, she
arrived on schedule at St. Thomas’s Church
in North Sydney for her marriage with
Dr. Douglas Cookson, eldest son of Dr. Cook-
son, of Balmain. Pink tulle misted in
Limerick lace started at the veil and foamed
over into a train that was nearly the length
of the aisle. Bride’s sister Mrs. Rex Fut-
ter, of Bungendore, was matron-of-honor, and
with Jean Brown, of Parramatta, in roseate
taffetas, led a procession in which three tiny
pink and ivory trainbearers were wafted
along in the wake of the pink tulle and lace
bridal train. Two chums, Dr. Macdonald
and Dr. Waterhouse, looked after the groom’s
interests, and a monster party, under the
direction of Dr. and Mrs. Throsby, shook
the Warringah Hall to its foundations.
W. E. Booth, of red-roofed Mosman, the
Bulletin’s old-established auditor, didn’t
wait to count the cost of youngest-daughter
Elsie’s wedding outfit. It was one of the
handsomest ever seen in the Mosman kirk,
and started in an underdress of silver, top-
ped by georgette weighted with silver
embroideries, and finished off with two
flounces of chenille fringe that practically
formed a skirt in themselves. A train of
beaten silver and a Limerick-lace veil of
great beauty lent by Mrs. Owen, of Gun-
dagai, were further accessories. Three
bridesmaids in silver-lace poke bonnets and
taffeta frocks in pink, blue and mauve of
the same “Sketches-by-Boz” atmosphere
attended Elsie; and Ivan Wark, Pli.D.,
D.Sc., of Melbourne Uni., took her for
better or worse, and seemed very glad of
the opportunity. Mrs. Wark, who had come
from Melbourne to attend her son’s wedding,
wore handsome blaek-and-gold frocking; the
same coloring appearing in Mrs. Booth's
georgettes. The Anzac Memorial Hall
housed the subsequent celebration. The
bride, besides a trousseau, brings a B.Sc.
to her new home, along with something of
a record from the Uni. women’s hockey
team.
Kathleen Hollingdale, youngest daughter
of the well-known Edgecliff family, has just
announced her honorable intentions towards
Captain A. J. Revell, of the Ist Madras
Pioneers (K.G.A.), Bangalore, India.
Plucky Warde Morgan, fighting his way
back to health, is to be given a stimulant
of goodwill and £ s. d. by the public and the
profession. It will be remembered that
Warde was terribly knocked about in the
Aberdeen train smash, and since then his
address has been mostly Jenner Hospital.
So a testimonial matinee is being arranged
for him. A monster committee has been formed
to push the affair along. Nellie Stewart is
the president and E. J. Tait so far the
biggest producer of real money. He gave
£250 for the managerial box at Her
Majesty’s and then handed it over for re-
sale. Prominent among the workers is Mrs.
John McKelvey, whose husband is the bril-
liant surgeon who has coaxed the actor back
to health.
So seldom is Australia given any indica-
tion of generosity by a visiting musician that
Paderewski’s determination to hand over the
proceeds of his final matinee, in Australia for
the benefit of Anzac orphans comes like a
thunderbolt. The matinee is dated for Thurs-
day at 2.30 in the Town Hall. In this
Letter’s memory the only other concert artist
who left the loot of a final concert behind
him was John MacCormack —he netted
nearly £lOOO for the Lewisham Hospital.
Melba paid an unexpected visit to the
McNally exhibition at May Moore’s big studio
the other morning. The show is one of the
delights of the week, and makes the gazer
forget that the world is in the clasp of
winter. The Dame w T ore a coat of Canadian
mink wrapped about her body, while the
priceless throat was warmed by a string of
pearls. Number three shoes and slim ankles
were other accessories.
The sale of Kioto, the Edmund Playfair
home at Waverley, reminds this Letter that
Justly Rawlings, Anthony Horderns’ manag-
ing director, will for the future be the host
at Chatsworth, Potts Point. He bought it
from Scott Fell for something in the neigh-
borhood of £25,000.
Dr. “Whiskers” Ward, the genial and
erudite old journalist who edited the Daily
Telegraph, lost a sister by the death of Miss
Elizabeth Raymond Ward. She was born 83
years ago, whilst her parents were on the
way to Maoriland. The treaty of Waitangi
had just been signed, and the father of the
family, the Rev. Robert Ward, was sent out
to look after the Methodist souls in the new
community. She lived in Taranaki for most
of her earlier life, but had spent the .last
42 years in Sydney.
Well over a hundred descendants mourned
Mrs. Mary Ann Sullings, who was married
at 35. and that was 68 years ago, and was
probably the last woman who saw the bush-
ranger Thunderbolt alive. She was camped
for a meal by the roadside while on her way
to TJralla when a stranger asked for water,
and, at her invitation, he had some tea.
“A perfect gentleman” was her always-
afterwards expressed opinion of the man
she learnt was Thunderbolt when next morn-
ing she heard that he had been shot by the
police. The old lady’s husband kept Hill-
grove’s chief hotel for 40 years, including
the period when Baker’s Creek was a name
of magic on the Stock Exchange.
The first fur-coated first-night audience of
this year attended the Sydney Criterion on
Saturday; if the beauty which accom-
panied the chivalry of Sydney was prepared
to have its marrow chilled by the
mysteries of “The Ghost Train,” it was deter-
mined to protect its skin from the shivers
of a freezing night. The fact lent a new
interest —from a feminine point of view—to
the evening. Whispers like “Cost two hun-
dred guineas—and look at those pearls over
her collar! She’s not going to hide those,
however cold it is!” were to be heard. Xo
doubt the shirt-fronted who were not wealthy
enough to buy such trifles squirmed under
the implied reproach. In the boxes Dan Car-
roll looked across at a small Tait party. In
the box with Dan was Leo do Chateau, show-
ing a brisk mop of white hair which was
anything but white in the days Sydney knew
him as a comedian. Nowadays he is guiding
the destinies of the Repertory movement m
Maoriland; but his old association with Car-
roll ventures makes him a personal friend or
that firm.
The Sydney Hospital will benefit by the
Dickens Fellowship nights at the King’s Hall
on June 2 and 3. “Little Dorrit” will be
filmed, and scenes from Shakspeare, pre-
sented by members of the Shakspeare soci-
ety, the'whole to be served to the accom-
paniment of Old English music by Clement
Hoskins’s concert party. A prize of two
guineas for the best essay on the film is
being offered to students by the Fellowship.

HARDY BROS. lID
THE entire China, Glass, and
Silverware supplied to
Government House and
the Prime Minister’s Lodge by
Hardy Bros. Ltd., of which a
few typical pieces are here illus-
trated, is of late 18th century
pattern.
A large majority of the plate
was Old Sheffield reproduction
after the type of the pieces
shown.
The Glassware is an Old Irish
pattern of infinite grace and
beauty, whilst the Prime Min-
ister’s afternoon tea service is
of the best Crown Derby in a
shade of brick red, gold, black
and white, a cup and saucer of
which are reproduced here.
The cider jug is worthy of
special mention. Many of the
best patterns were used for these
cider jugs and we understand
they are being used at Govern-
ment House as cold water jugs.

Colgate’s Anti-Chafe Baby Powder is soothing 1 ,
mildly antiseptic and aids in healing. It is
delightfully soft.
After bathing your baby apply a little powder
under the arms, between the legs and in all folds
of the skin. When chafing is likely to develop
be more liberal with the powder.
The great care taken in the selection of mat-

good to relieve or pre-

with delicate skins can

The Melbourne Hunt Club held its first
meet at Berwick on Monday and enjoyed a
bright frosty morning. The pack and 70
horses and riders went out by train, meeting
at the railway-station fully as many local
enthusiasts. Deputy-master George Landaie
for the first time was in charge of the hounds,
leading a cavalcade of pink-coated and silk-
hatted huntsmen and well-turned-out women
riders (two of whom favored the side saddle),
several girls and boys on Shetland ponies,
and a couple of cyclists. Many motor-cars
joined the merry chase through muddy lanes,
and some got bogged. Though two foxes
were sighted there was no kill. Secretary
Norman Wood, General Johnston and daugh-
ter Gwen, Mrs. E. T. Embling, Lorna Joan
Chirnside, Mrs. Albert Weigall and Hylda
McCardel were amongst those who followed
the hounds.
The coming of the Yorks at the beginning
of our social season has thrown private
entertaining somewhat out of gear, and with
the exception of a few charity bridge parties
and the usual run of plays, concerts and
art shows, there is nothing doing. No doubt
the dearth of events was responsible for the
large attendance of women at Moonee Valley
races on Saturday, though the weather
encouraged thoughts of an easy chair by the
fireside. Heavy showers and a cold wind
that penetrated through any number of
layers of fur made race-going a heroic
business. There was a brave display of
pelts, but several of our smartest maidens
turned out in tweed suits and top-coats and
protected their shins with the new woollen
spats in check and plaid designs, with tops
like golf-socks ending just below the knee.
The spats, or spatees, as some call them,
gave a naughty suggestion of bare knees
when worn over flesh-pink stockings, but
they were undoubtedly comfy—perhaps more
so than the two-stocking mode, with their
inner sheath of flesh-tinted wool.
Though the roses had been newly pruned
a few yellow blooms spread their fragrance,
and the lawns were fresh and green. The
line new stand in the members’ enclosure,
nearly finished, came in for a lot of admira-
tion. The chairman and committee lunched
at tables garnished with a wealth of roses
from the Alister Clark garden, the guests
including Governor and Lady Somers, she
in tweeds, rust-red leather coat, fox-furs
and beige felt, _ Captain Davidson and
his wife and Ministers of the new Gov-
ernment. The Russell Clarkes were on the
lawn, she adding furs to a cornflower-blue
raincoat and navy felt hat. Dr. J. Wilkie
Young’s wife, Mrs. Harley Styles, the James
Purves couple, the John Merrillees, the Wes-
ton Pett couple, Fairlie and Noel Lyon and
Kathleen Rogers Thomson were also among
those who defied the weather.
The Australian Ladies’ Kennel Club, whose
annual show will be in full cry to-day, looks
back to a forlorn little affair 23 years ago
"hen 52 dogs and 58 cats were made nice and
tidy for the judges. Now the canines and
felines come along in big battalions. Until
last year, when Mrs. Davidson, wife of Gov-
ernor Somers’s Highland secretary, took on
the job, every president has had a handle —
it’s swanky to be doggy—and there’s still a
title available for the front page of the cata-
logue, for Lady Somers is patron.
The dance given by the Chinese younger set
at their Embassy last week, when the Soccer
team from the land of the Dragon was enter-
tained. didn’t look very much different from
a swell affair at Toorak. The only feminine
dancer who stuck to the fashions of her home-
land in any degree was good-looking Mrs.
Kwong, wife of Professor Kwong, manager of
the team. _ Her brown-and-gold gown was
covered with a long coat of black brocade
with lovely embroidery. Mrs. T. K. Quee,
wife of the Consul-General for China, wore
glistening of crystal upon a pink frock. Lots
of pretty Chinese maidens were there, shingled
and Eton cropped, and mostly taffeta-clad in
shades of pink. They could all one-step, fox-
trot and Charleston.
“Be Masque Dramatique” has been vali-
antly helping the Creches’ Association. A
double bill opened with a one-act sketch,“The
Burglar,’’ by Loveday Hills, followed by a
three-act play, “The Bushwhackers,” by
Beryl Bissett. In each case the young play-
wright carried an important role in her own
work. Miss Hills showed more ability as
an actress than as a playmaker. Her robber
was so attractive that the timid lady whose
premises he burgled was easily persuaded to
leave an irritable husband and levant with
the buccaneer and the family plate. Beryl
Bissett, who paired off her characters at the
final curtain in the good old way, dealt with
the reformation of maidens who preferred
independent careers to marriage, but who
were cured after wandering in the bush in
comic-opera suits of green with a dash of
red. Honors in acting were about evenly
distributed between the author, Ervina Addi-
son and Maurice Latimer. “The Foot-
warmers” jazz orchestra, consisting of
ex-students of Melbourne Grammar School,
was a tower of strength. There were lots
of flowers for the playwright-actresses and
their fair companions, and Beryl Bissett
said “thanks” for and to all, wearing pale-
blue chiffon velvet flounces that flowed from
a superstructure of old-gold satin. Mrs.
J. Watson Robertson, hon. secretary of the
association, voiced the gratitude of her com-
mittee, and said a few words about the
creches. Sheila Robertson, Jean Ferguson
and F. Hurley were attractive programme-
sellers.
Agnes Goodsir is showing at the Fine
Arts Gallery the fruits of a long sojourn in
Paris. She made frequent visits to Eng-
land and lias exhibited at the Royal
Academy, but mostly she has lived in the
French capital, having a studio at Mont
Parnasse and a flat near the Odeon Theatre.
Among the pictures she has brought back
with her is a portrait-study of a woman in
black which last year gained for her a
Societaire de Beaux Arts. Though the artist
broke her left arm shortly after her return,
she has undertaken a number of commis-
sions already, among them portraits of Mrs.
Norman Armytage, Sonia, the pretty little
daughter of the Percy Landales, Robert Lan-
dale and his daughter Joan and Mr. Hunter
Patterson. Miss Goodsir will take some of
her work to Sydney, where it will be shown
in the Macquarie Galleries in July. She
is booked to return to Paris in October.
Dr. Constance Ellis opened Jessie Traill's
show of pictures at the New Arts Gallery,
and said many complimentary things, which
were corroborated by Canon Snodgrass.
Churches and bridges predominated among
the subjects, which were glimpsed in France,
Spain, Italy and England, and oils, water-
colors and etchings figured in the collection.
A large muster of art-lovers and fellow-
painters assembled on the first day, and the
exhibitor, who wore a nattier-blue suit with
a black-velvet hat, received many congratu-
lations. Archdeacon Aitken, the Maudsley
and Masson ladies, Dr. Georgina Sweet and
Judge Moule’s wife were there. The brusli-
and-palette brigade, included Margaret Mae-
Lean. Mrs. Vale Gilfillan, Vida Lahey and
Norah Gurdon.
Mrs. J. Watson Robertson, pictured here
by Lafayette, is one of the big driving forces
behind the
CrSches’ Asso-
ciation, which
lias under its
direct ion 10
day - nurseries
where babies
of work in g
women are
cared for dur-
in g business
hours. Two
women doctors
lately inspect-
ed these excel-
lently-managed
institutions on
behalf of the
Govern m e n t,
and reported
in enthusiastic
terms. Mrs.
Robertson, in
addition to be-
ing honorary
secretary of the Creches’ Association, is
president of the Women’s National Club and
a prominent member of the English-Speaking
Union.
H. S. Power’s show at the Athenaeum Gal-
lery was opened by Governor Somers, and
General Chauvel, who is a great admirer of
the painter’s work as an official war artist,
said a few words, too. Lady Somers, whose
brick-red frock was worn with a fawn felt
hat, received from Mrs. Power a posy of
carnations. The Gcmval’s lady was wrapped
in a grey coat topped by blue millinery. The
Prime Minister’s wife was in coat of mole
fur, cheered with a bunch of violets, and a
black velvet hat. Artist Agnes Goodsir, Lav-
ington Bonytlion and his daughter Betty, from
Adelaide, Mrs. Gordon Chirnside and Colonel
and Mrs. W. St. L. Robertson were there.
Mrs. Lane-Poole said the opening words at
the water-color show of Herbert R. Gallop,
Whistler’s grandson, at the Sedon Gallery.
She wore a black gown with a mole cape.
Among those who admired the Australian
artist’s pictures were the Rutledge and Ilob-
inson ladies, Mrs. Harry Mcßoberts and Mrs.
John Good.
Pupils of 11. A. Thomson showed what
young Australians can do in the way of piano-
forte playing on Friday afternoon at the
Victorian Artists’ Galleries, when Paderewski
was an honored visitor. The great music-
maker liked the entertainment so well that he
spoke w T ords of encouragement to each pupil,
complimented their teacher and gave a
scholarship for annual competition. Balla-
rat, famed for its devotion to music, produced
four of the young players who pleased the
wizard of the keyboard-—Mary Rusden, Kath-
arine Kearns, Doris Lugg and Lalle Mere-
dith. Agnes O’Keefe, a Melbourne young-
ster, was another.
Justice Schutt, who took in New York on
his way to Europe, joined his wife in the
Riviera, and the pair gave their address as
somewhere in Dalmatia when they were
heard from last. When the Judge wandered
abroad on a former occasion he fell in with
Leo Tolstoy, at that time chipping marble
for a living, under a vow to earn his own
crusts, and the illustrious one chiselled a
bust of the lawyer. The job was done in
tlie studio of Agues Goodsir in Paris.
Harold Septimus Power, here pictured by
Lafayette, has earned a great deal of fame
as a painter of horses, but his private ambi-
tion is to be
able to paint
gum-trees as
well as Hans
Heysen does.
He gets pretty
near his ideal
sometimes, too.
The artist was
born in Maori-
land but cross-
ed the Tasman
in infancy. He
was trained as
a vet., but de-
cided that he
would rather
make pictures
of horses than
prescribe for
their ailments.
Th e greater
part of his art
training was
received in
Paris, and it is 23 years since lie left Aus-
tralia to inhabit the Latin Quarter. But
he flits back and forth freouently. With
Bill Mclnnes he shares the honor of being
appointed to immortalise the Canberra open-
ing. His job is the outside view, and lie
hopes to begin work after lie has had a
show in Sydney.
Charles Parbury’s widow, who has died in
London, left £60,000. mostly made in this
city by the late merchant. She was a Mel-
bourne girl, one of the Strachan family, but
for many years had made her home overseas.
A practical remembrance of her homeland
was the £5OO she left to the Children’s Hos-
pital. Geelong Infirmary will have an extra
£lOO to help it along, too.
Mrs. Nicholas, once well known in Mel-
bourne as Rosalind Gard, is again venturing
into the connubial cage. Her engagement
is announced to Keith Melville Balfour, son
of the late Dr. G. W. Balfour, Edinburgh.
The wedding is to take place at an early
date in London.
Colonel Talbot’s daughter Barbara is likely
to revisit her home. After becoming Mrs.
Reginald Perritt she went to live in South
Africa. She is eager to bring her hus-
band and her two little daughters for an
Australian holiday, and many are anxious
that it may soon come to pass, for Barbara
was a great favorite in her own circle.
The James Purves couple had a bad shock
last week when a cable announced that their
daughter Valerie’s tour abroad had been
halted in London by an attack of appendicitis.
The famous surgeon Douglas Shields oper-
ated and reports that his patient is progress-
ing favorably.
The Alexandra Club, though it prides itself
on its exclusiveness, is finding itself -crowded
and has bought some adjoining land for build-
ing purposes. All the Melbourne clubs devoted
to women are feeling the same pinch. The
Quamby is packing its cubs and saucers for a
temporary move down street —to quarters
which will not permit of residential rooms
for country members.
The Fred Scarlett couple’s Toorak home
was the scene of a young folks’ dance on
Friday night, at which daughter Nancy, wear-
ing transparency of gold and green over
almond-green taffeta, was hostess. Mrs.
Scarlett was in raiment of black, brightened
with bead embroideries, and Sadie Scarlett
danced in geranium-pink with additions of
gold lace. Mrs. T. A. Tabart and her daugh-
ters Pixie and Edna, Kathleen Rogers Thom-
son. Elizabeth and Nancy Stawell and Janet
Wimpole were guests.
Golden-brown chrysanthemums and a glow-
ing fire gave a cheery welcome to guests of
the South Yarra Tennis Club on Saturday
niglit, when a dance was held in the club
house. Mr. and Mrs. L. Baker joined the
jazzers, she having silk-fringed raiment of
powder-blue crepe de Chine; Esna Boyd wore
a bridge coat of gold lame over a frock of
reseda green georgette: Helen Greene was in
violet taffeta and Thelma Halbert glowed in
crimson georgette. Eve Wilkinson's white
covering flickered with gold sequins.
At the King’s Theatre on Saturday night
“Six-Cylinder Love” was seen. It’s a well-
frocked play, and the humor is clean and
crisp. Virginia Norton, as Geraldine Bur-
ton, wife of the man who bought a car,
wears in the opening act a pretty confection
of hydrangea-blue georgette and satin; and
Mary Rigby, as her daughter, adds a short
lace coat to amber-georgette covering. Noel
Boyd as Margaret Rogers, the . free-ride
hound, affected crimson chiffon-velvet and
a hat of the same warm hue. The nice little
bride Marilyan Sterling (Mary Ellen Han-
ley), who learns that car-owning has pains as
well as pleasures, outran the speed limit in
a frock of biscuit hue with a touch of
emerald green, a fur-collared black satin
coat and trim black toque. The flowers
handed up to the ladies were beautiful and
many. A winter's-night audience, well
coated and wrapped, showed no glad-rags,
for collars were turned up. Mrs. T. A.
Tabart and her daughter Edna, Dr. Bren-
dan O’Sullivan and his wife, the Percy
Blackbournes, the John and Frank Taits
and Mrs. Douglas Stewart were among those
who welcomed the company.
Lady Somers was in the chair at the
annual meeting of the Hospital Red Cross
Auxiliary, when a report was read showing
that gifts during the year, in cash and
kind, amounted to £3739. The Birthday
League headed the list with £1270. Expen-
diture for the year, the fifth of the auxili-
ary’s existence, was only £l3 16s. Sd. The
Entertainments Branch, as the result of
three shows, was able to hand over £lOOO,
half of which goes to endow a bed. The
outpatients’ canteen and the tea-room and
kiosk were sources of help. The Auxiliary
will lose a good worker when the Garran
lady, who was a member of the first com-
mittee, and is president of the Toorak
branch, goes to Canberra. Lady Somers
congratulated the Auxiliary on its fine re-
cord and told some stories about her own
war-work experiences—some of the jokes
were against herself—and medical knight
George Syme spoke of the increasing work
of the institution. Former office-bearers
were re-elected, with the Miller lady as pre-
sident and Jessie Bage as lion. sec. and
treasurer.
The National Council of Women met at the
Athenaeum Hall on Thursday night, with pre-
sident Mrs. Glencross in the chair, to elect
additional delegates and link up three new
societies. Federal Attorney-General Latham
talked about the Imperial Conference and
the League of Nations. It had been intended
also to screen the League of Nations’ play
“Pen versus Sword,” but the movie was
banned because of fire risk. Freda Bage, who
has come from Queensland to spend the Uni-
versity vacation with her mother, was there
and had something to say about the League,
too.
An Australian woman who is in this city
again after some years in San Francisco
reckons that Melbourne folk would feel more
cheerful if thev didn’t celebrate a wet day by
putting on black. In ’Frisco and throughout
the gay State of California the arrival of a
shower is the signal for the appearance of
cute little brollies and raincoats made of
rubberised fabric in green, blue, yellow, red.
pink, orange and heliotrope.
The Talbot Colony of Epileptics is being
presented with a portrait of Miss M. M.
Guthrie, who for 20 years has been a great
worker among these sufferers. Rupert Bunny
has painted the philanthropist; and Donald
Mackinnon, president of the Colony, is the
donor. The picture will be handed over by
Mayor Morell next Tuesday.
A team of English women hockey-players
will engage in matches here next month, the
first game being fixed for June IS at the
Albert ground. The visitors will be the
guests of tlie Women’s Hockey Association,
and a gymkhana will be held on June 6 at
the Teachers’ College to help pay for the
entertaining.
“A.G.M.” writes from London :
Three daughters of the late Dr. Hackett, pro-
prietor of the West Australian, are to be presented
at the forthcoming Court by their mother, who has
enlivened the winter for her girls by a series of
weekly dances at her home in Queen’s Gate. The
youngest daughter, Joan, who has shown a gift for
languages, will be going to the Sorbonne in the
autumn with a view to taking a degree. The elder,
Verna, is studying medicine; and Patricia is a
law student at the Inner Temple. Applications for
entree to the Royal Courts are now made in quite
open fashion, just as one sends in for the first
night of a big theatrical production. There is none
of the exclusiveness which marked Queen Victoria’s
drawing-rooms or the early assemblies of King
Edward’s reign.

Leylands are Building the
Australia of To-morrow
T EYLAND LORRIES are playing a vital part in the
development of Australia. You will find them in the
service of Government Departments; they are at work
in the key industries; they serve the great stores and
factories; and away in the back country they are blazing
the trail of settlement.
LEYLAND LORRIES
Last Longest Cost Less in Service
It is not only inherent Leyland qualities such as depend-
ability, British workmanship, trouble-free service and
slow depreciation that have won the best British lorry
built” so prominent a place in the development of the
Commonwealth. There are also the prompt and efficient
service facilities, including £30,000 worth of spares,
which are at the call of every Australian Leyland-owner,
and which ensure that every Leyland Lorry shall deliver
the fullest efficiency.

“Borom”: A curious job is that of the
liam-smeller. When a ham is being cured,
it sometimes goes bad inside, close to the
bone. It is the smeller’s job to find out, and
he has to have a nose like a hound to do
it. There aren’t many ham-smellers in Aus-
tralia, but what there are of them can always
be sure of a job at high wages.

“Ledraw” : Some districts are better suited
than others for oyster-culture. Large ship-
ments of spat are being sent from the Lower
Clarence (N.S.W.) to the Manning River
and Camden Haven for maturing purposes.
It has been found that, although the Clarence
is the best district for spats, it is not
equal to rivers further south for maturing
purposes.

great strength of jheetu, or saffron-heart (B.
19/5/’27), ought to interest all constructional
engineers. I have worked out the breaking-
strain of the stuff on the usual formula,
from the data supplied by “Bream,” and
it works out at 16.2 tons to the square inch !
Steel isn’t in it, weight for weight, with this
marvellous timber.
* * * *
“8.T.”: The soldier settlement wine dis-
tillery at Berri (S.A.), on the Murray, is
doing well. For the first year 3562 tons of
grapes were dealt with; last year 13,602
tons were put through, and the plant can
now take 20,000 tons in the five working
months. One day this season 500 tons of
grapes were weighed, passed up the ramp,
and crushed within eight hours.

“B. Zine”: Carrying coal from mine to
rail by water-flume is out of favor in Maori-
land. Westport-Stockton mine tried it, but
found it meant too much loss of small coal
and a heavy cost for relining flumes. This
flume was 5i miles long and descended 2000
feet to sea-level, and the grade may have
had something to do with the unsatisfactory
result. The Cascade Co., a new venture,
has a flume 71 miles long which hasn’t yet
had much user If this doesn’t work satis-
factorily there’ll be no more water-flumes in
Westland.

“Antonio”: Those who believe a saving
grace is conferred by the letters E. & O. E.
on commercial documents will be shocked by
the decision in a recent English case, Berg
v. Landauer. There was an error of date in
a bill of lading—it turned out to be very
important though only one day wrong—and
the Court held the letters E. & O. E., which
appeared on the bill, could not make a docu-
ment which conveyed inaccurate information
answer the description of a document pro-
viding accurate information.
* *
“Yerri”: The Maoriland Government is
worried about Norwegian whalers in the
Ross Sea. The Dominion takes a toll of
2s. 6d. a barrel, but can only collect it if
the whalers use her ports. Although the
Ross Sea Dependency is nominally under the
control of Maoriland, the Imperial Govern-
ment issues permits to the foreign whalers,
and the Government of Fernland has at
present no power to interfere with them.
Now the Norwegians threaten to cease using
M.L. ports, and in that case the whaling
revenue will be reduced to just about nothing.
Not only that, but at the present rate of
killing whales will soon be pretty nearly
extinct in Ross Sea. So something is going
to be done.

“Harold Hardupp” : The rise in land values
about Sydney is illustrated by the sale of
part of the sandhill tract at North Bondi
at an average price of £22-odd a foot _of
frontage. One corner block brought £3l
a foot. It is only a little over 10 years
since some Bondi sections belonging to
Comino (gratefully remembered for his bob
meals, which included boiled fowl with real
oyster sauce) were sold for £2O a foot. That
was regarded as a sensational price, but the
land was on the main sea-front road, where
shops were rapidly going up. Comino got
the land for a mere song when the old
swamp was drained off. but when he reaped
his harvest the North Bondi sandhills were
regarded as no more valuable than a similar
area of the Pacific Ocean.
* * * *
“Lytt” : People who believe they have dis-
covered the secret of perpetual motion crop
up every two or three years, and some of
them are very hard to disillusion. The. latest
claimant is an Auckland (M.L.) youth, Ruel
Nicholas do Cassey. He is very mysterious
regarding the nature of his discovery, and
admits that lie hasn’t even made a working
model. But he has studied all the other per-
petuai-motion machines, and is sure he is on
the right track. They all are, but the only
machine for which such claims were made
that really worked was the Keeley motor,
and that depended on a secret supply of
compressed air. Stephenson, of pioneer loco-
motive fame, expressed the orthodox view of
such mechanical excursions when he said he
would believe the principle was discoverable
when the inventor could carry himself round
a room by grasping his own boot-tabs.

“Larrapinta”: The four-masted barque
Herzogin Cecilie, which recently made the
voyage from Port Lincoln (S.A.) to Queens-
town (Ireland) in 88 days (B. 19/5/’27),
is easily the stoutest and fastest wind-
jammer afloat. She was built in Germany
just before the war as a training-ship
for cadets, and handed over to the
French Government after the Armistice,
to be presently sold to her present Swedish
owners for the proverbial song. She is a
flush-decked' steel ship, with all the masts
and yards—except the royal yards—of hollow
steel. Her present skipper has found that
it is unnecessary to take in any of the heavy
canvas however hard it blows; the worst
that can happen is for a sail to blow out
of the bolt-ropes. Among her performances
(taken from the ship’s log) are (1) 16
knots in the “roaring ’forties”; (2) a trip
from Capetown to Kangaroo Island (S.A.)
in 19 days; and (3) 370 miles logged off
in 24 hours in the n.-e. trade-winds. She
carries a trifle of 52,000 bags of wheat when
fully laden, yet it only takes a skeleton crew
of 20 to work her.

Read the time in the dark
OFTEN, just before dawn, comes that half awake
desire to know the time. Drowsily you roll
your eyes towards your clock —It’s then you’d
appreciate having a luminous dial Westclox that
glows in the dark.
No need to switch on the light. A peep through
half closed eyes tells the story. Westclox are truth-
ful. When time’s up, you can depend on a
rousing, cheerful call.
Pocket Ben is the watch member of the Westclox
family. Plain or luminous dials.

One can find excuses for Louis XV. after
seeing Beppie de Vries in “La Pompadour,”
which is just finishing its run at His
Majesty’s, Brisbane. An Indian potentate
and his son were in a box on the first night
and sent a gift to the leading lady, probably
owing to her prowess in the Nautch dance.
When one of the chorus girls who was carry-
ing a torch set her sleeve afire, Beppie de
Vries slipped from her position near the wing
and smothered the flame with her bare hands.
The audience cheered her promptness and the
play went merrily on. The frocking is par-
ticularly beautiful.
The Dewan Bahadur Rangachariar is
spending a week in Bananaland with his two
sons. He went to the Empire Day celebra-
tions in the Exhibition Hall, and Mayor
Jolly took him up One Tree Hill and round
to the seaside places. Chief Justice Blair,
A. D. McGill and Judge Woolcock have also
held out the glad hand to the gentleman who
came from India for the sake of Canberra.
Mrs. Fred Horwood, formerly Mrs. B. J.
Brown, has died at Sandgate, after a long
illness. She was the youngest daughter of the
late Mr. J. C. W. Bowman. Her uncle, Louis
Roper Fitzmaurice, was an officer on the
Beagle, Darwin’s discovery-boat, and the
Roper River was named after him. Her
grandfather was a middy on the Victory,
being wounded at Trafalgar.
Edward Branscombe gave a lecture on
“Some Unconsidered Aspects of Music” be-
fore the Music Teachers’ Association in the
Women’s Club rooms. He dwelt upon the
spiritual side, and declared the East was
ahead of the West, because Eastern ears
could hear notes that Western ears could not.
He believes in a brotherhood of harmony,
developed by community singing. Gladys
Frost was in the chair.
Windsor has been very busy all the week
over its Eisteddfod. Lindley Evans, from
the South, has been busy, too, with the
awards. As usual, the Curlew Choir scored.
Bert Donovan, of Glen View, took Doris
Chandler to wife in St. David’s, Omanama.
White flowers and foliage decked the church,
and the bride was in cream silk mariette. She
carried cream roses. Mrs. Percy Batterham
lent the silk tulle veil. The Vene maiden,
in coral-pink, was one bridesmaid and Mary
Reeves, in pervenche blue, the other.
The Norman Park School of Arts had its
tennis-club dance in a setting of lavender and
gold. St. Stephen’s C.E. had a party in aid
of the church, arranged by a committee of
helpers, in the Coorparoo Shire hall. Scarlet
and gold were their decorations.
Mrs. Geoffrey Archbutt, who was a Cadell
Garrick, is coming over from Hong-Kong to
visit the J. Cadell Garricks, at Albion. At
the year’s end she will go to England to meet
her husband.
Our best-known novelist, Mrs. Forrest,
whose “Hibiscus Heart” is now looking at
us from the bookstalls, lately had the pleas-
ure of pocketing a trifle for the right to pub-
lish some,of her stories in Dutch.
We are quite used to covering our feet
with the pelts of lizards, snakes and croco-
diles, and now there’s a chance that we may
be shod in shark-skin. The raw material is
abundant in the seas around the upper half
of the continent, and the ingenious Teuton
has produced a tanning process and machi-
nery for dressing the sea-tiger’s epidermis.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The Coast Battery’s ball at the Anglesea
Barracks was quite a big affair. About 600
turned up to try the newly improved floor,
and his Ex. and Margaret O’Grady, with
about 90 other civilian guests, mingled with
the military and their womenfolk. The deco-
rations were m red and blue, the colors'of the
unit. Dancing was kept up till past one
(oooh—we only whisper this!) and the
supper is still mentioned in reverential tones.
This Bur-
ge s s Watt

picts our new
Mayoress, Mrs.
J. J. Wignall,
whose official
troubles and

all before her.
The choice of
Alderman Wig-
nall to wear

pleased every-
one, and his

her through the
dull months

It looks as if the artificial-silk industry
will take root in Tassie, but, even so, Hobart
lassies are not likely to get their silk stock-
ings cheaper than anyone else. Bloaters are
not given away in Yarmouth, nor are coals
as free as air in Newcastle. Nevertheless,
it won’t do any harm to start a new indus-
try. Every little helps to keep our boys
from wandering off to the mainland. Signors
Tanfani and A llamel, the promoters of the
scheme to increase unemployment among
silkworms, are being entertained, and are
much looked up to both in business and
social circles.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
The Yorks have gone, but we are too
busy with our memories to have much time
yet for present affairs. One pleasant little
recollection clings to the Saturday afternoon
when sleety rain descended, but the royal pair
wouldn't have the hood of their car up. The
Duchess, all in mist-grey and squirrel, with
a little rose-pink cloche, put up her umbrella
and helped Albert P. on with his coat, just
like any fond little wife.
Keith McDougall, Victor Trounce and
“Jumbo”. Evans had two mornings of fast
tennis with the Duke on Government House
court. During the play a woman dodged
among the trees clicking a camera. She
informed H.R.11. that she had come 10,000
miles for that snap, and disappeared as
suddenly as she arrived. Whether she scaled
the wall, burrowed under it or hurdled it is
still a mystery.
A wet afternoon spoilt the wearing of
garden-party clothes to the races held
towards the far end of the visit. Royalty
couldn’t squeeze time between the King’s
Park demonstration and leaving for the Ivala-
inunda week-end to present the cup for the
Duke of York Handicap. Lady Campion
braved the storm in black w r ith a pink ostrich
posy, Mrs. Kerr-Pearse had embroidered black
and grey furs and Mrs. Wilkinson and Molly
Atkins wore suits of green. Dr. Moss’s wife
favored the same shade with rich sables.
Neva Hocking wore a brown coney coat and
Mrs. A. Trouchet and Miss Tickie chose
tailor-mades.
This is Bartletto’s likeness of the first
woman to become an M.P. in the Southern
Hemisphere. Mrs. James Cowan is president
of the National
Council of
Women, and
represented the
Aus t r a 1 i a n
National Coun-
cil at the Con-
gress in Wash-
ington in 1925.
She was vice-
president of the
W.A. League
of Nations
Union, helped
t o establish
the Country
Women’s As-
sociation, and
i s vice-presi-
dent and foun-,
dation member
of the Infant
Welfare Asso-
ciation and a
dozen other
little agencies. She has sat on the Bench
in the Children’s Court for 15 years, and
was the first chairman of the Soldiers’ Wel-
come Committee, and its president for 12
years.
Duchess Betty left behind her a memory of
a bright smile and many pretty frocks. We
caught our first glimpse of her in a georg-
gette gown of forget-me-not blue. A bunch
of those blossoms nodded from the brim of
her little cloche hat, also of blue georgette;
she wore a coat of blue and silver brocke
collared in squirrel and a triple rope of
pearls, and her shoes were of fawn kid with
bands of a deeper fawn. At the Government
House ball she was all a silver dream, and
wore three strings of pearls with emerald
pendants and diamond-and-emerald shoulder
ornament. The long skirt of her low-cut gown
showed slanting rows of gleaming bead fringe.
Her bracelet and tiara were of diamonds, and
she carried a silver bag and a fan of shaded
pink ostrich.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
There were dual festivities to mark the
restoration of the golf links to Glenelg—
the original course, the first in the State,
vanished in a subdivisional scheme some
years ago—a tea in the afternoon and at
night a dance in the club-house. The Gov-
ernor drove the first ball and declared open
the nine holes that the committee hopes
soon to extend to 18. At the dance honors
were done by Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Roberts
(he is the club’s president and has given it
a tea-house that has yet to be built), she
in black and gold, the club colors.
There has been a sports dance at North
Adelaide, too, the organisers being that sub-
urb’s lacrossers, headed by A. J. Lee. K.
A. Brock, W. Acraman, C. J. Glover and H.
Rule, and the setting the Floating Palais.
The Uni. has added another £lOOO (Lang-
don Bonython the donor) to the fund for its
Union building, thereby bringing the total
up to a useful £SOOO.
Girl Guides are going all-out at the
moment. A pageant the other day was fol-
lowed by an American tea at Glenelg, staged
in Mrs. 11. S. Iludd’s garden and opened
by her Ex. Proceeds were for the newly
formed Glenelg 2nd Company —a fledgling
still in need of colors, camping equipment
and the rest.
The Babies’ Aid Society, formed 10 years
ago by Mrs. Napier Birks, who is still its
president, has just had its annual stock-
taking and summarised a year’s work that
included providing outfits for 130 babies, a
matter of about 2000 garments. Forty of
the outfits have come from the girls at
Charles Birks and Co.’s store, who provide
the materials as well as make them up, and
have collected £5O into the bargain; no small
record for busy women.
Many a South Australian Digger will
grieve at the deatn of 11. J. Henderson, for
many years secretary of the Adelaide Club.
He it was who chose the site of the Cheer-
up Hut, designed it, and constituted himself
honorary clerk of works during its erec-
tion. He was one of the society’s board of
management from the beginning and all
through the war was one of its chief sup-
porters.
The death of Mrs. 11. A, Stock cuts an-
other link with the State’s early days. The
fifth daughter of the late John Morphett and
liis lady, she was first married to F. Cobb
and subsequently to R. A. Stock, who die!
some years ago. Of her two sons by tin*
first marriage, one is in Portugal and the
other in England. The only child of the
second marriage is Mrs. P. R. Newling.

idea.... J.O’C.: The verse about the knight and the
barber nearly got our hair off. ...Jim I).: Sorry you
sold the old farm ; but your lament is uninspiring.
R.C.: “Vine” may do; but the carpentry is
again too evident. However hard you work on it,
verse should appear spontaneous... .W.J.C.: No prose-
“poems,” thanks Cam D.: Your rude “Fore-
fathers” sleep in the w.p.b Jas. W.: “Ocean”
roars in trite verse lengths, and the absence of
rhyme emphasises the triteness.... Flo G.: Merely
gush.... Lulu G. We liked your reference to “Music
without Bars.” We, also, detest the musician who
plays outside the pub 1.L.N.: Your friends call
them “a great poem”? They certainly grate
A. 1.5.: There is some feeling in them, but
the expression is crude... .Tap: Can’t winnow
a decent grain from that bushel... .F.J.C,:
Has a musical note, but what’s it all about?
. ...R.C.C.: Trite. .. .H.M.M.: The description of
your love is of interest to the lady a10ne.... Laura

You cut your poetic woodpile rather well, but in-
variably fall over the pieces. .. .R.L.D.: You sha’n’t
“dance” on the “face of the harbor” here.... Yep:
P00r.... Kid McG.: That piling of tragic masses is
no good unless you build a story on it.... J.H.C.: A
good way off the destination; still, you may reach
it if you keep on trying... .Veronica: Some good
points, but not enough.... M.W.: Creditable for a
first attempt.... Ida: Not enough in it.... Fergus
D. : Your sob-story damped the whole mail....
Tom K. (Chatswood) : Artificial grief verses con-
vince us that you don’t really care tuppence....
G.H.8.: “A life unfraught by vice” is a queer
phrase. .. .J.M.H.: Its simple directness may get
“Recompense” through. Others crude... .Roger H.:
It tottered on the edge, but fell outward... .C.M.G.:
Only space for a glimpse at your garden
Where the flowers are carefully tended
But scarcely seem at ease,
And seem a little artificial,
And unknown to any breeze.
... .S.W.J.: A crude tragedy... .K.J.M.: The sketch
itself is merely a cherry in a cocktail... .G.R.N.: It
seemed promising at the start. “She had crept into
the room and blown out his lights.” But, alas,
they were only candles, and it proved a silly love-
story... .Geo. Lindsay: A dull narrative... .R.C.C.:
The doggerel barks its way home.... Bill Mcl.: Says
nothing much not particularly well. .. .W.R.D.: Verse

THE INKY WAY.
“A.K.” : Recently a letter arrived at the
office of a Sydney daily addressed to "The
Father of the Chapel.” A new office-boy
promptly included it in the mail of the
cleric who supplies the paper with a weekly-
sermon.
"D.S.H.”: One Queensland comp, man-
aged to label the alleged portrait of the lady
who occupied some space in recent cables
as “Damn Margaret Greville.” At least the
comp, got the blame, though some of th ■
paper’s readers persist in thinking it was
apposite editorial comment.
“Buntliorne”: The Melbourne Sun Pic-
torial lias been giving some hints as to
public memorials. In an aesthetic outburst
it says:—
Take London’s Nelson Column, at the foot of which
landseers and lions, symbolical of the strength of
tlie British nation, are poised ready to spring into
action at any moment in defence of their country.
No mention is made of the poised and natu-
ral-looking norman lindsays or the fierce
and carnivorous pliil mays.
Henry Percival Douglass, just dead, was
managing director of Vic’s oldest daily,
the Geelong Advertiser. This paper was
founded in 1840, the editor being James
Harrison, and the type and press were
provided by John Pascoe Fawkner, who had
used them to produce the Port Phillip
Patriot.
“Gregor”: Verily The Bulletin travels
to the remotest parts of the earth. An Aus-
tralian engineer, who has just returned
from Europe, told me that a while ago
he came across a couple of copies at Baku,
on the Caspian Sea. Investigation showed
that they had been left there by another
Australian who was in the service of an
American oil-exporting company. The
papers had been posted from The Bulletin
office to San Francisco, re-mailed to New
York, and finally reached Russia by way
of London.
“Hamer”: It happened in a Sydney news-
paper office only recently. The pressman’s
handwriting was bold but awkward and the
lino, man made the word Dam Ocles. The
sub-editor knew that even the appearance of
bad language should be avoided, and it was
only by a lucky chance that a reference to
“the sword of Ocles” escaped publication.
“Five-Corner”: P. Jeff Wallace, who
took the first type-crushing machine to
the north side of Sydney Harbor and
fan the first local paper at St. Leonards,
has had some queer experiences during iiis
long pilgrimage on the Inky Way. During
a local electioneering campaign one of the
candidates accused Jeff of wilfully misreport-
ing his speeches, and he denounced the paper
as “a low-down, lying, contemptible rag.”
Jeff got evens a week later by presenting his
readers and the world in general with a
whole column of “pi” that had been stand-
ing in the office for over a year. The fear-
some stuff was headed: “Mr. ’s address.”
Threats of libel ensued, but the writ never
came along.
“Oxmead” : When the first inter-State row-
ing races were held on the Swan River,
nearly 20 years ago, the leader-writer of the
West Australian was instructed to spread
himself on the memorable occasion and
aquatic matters generally. He tackled the
job in a fine glow of enthusiasm, and drew
a vivid picture of the various crews as they
would presently be seen contending in healthy
rivalry. It was a really eloquent piece of
descriptive writing, but the most arresting
passage of all was that wherein the writer
featured “each boat driven through the silver
Swan by eight pairs of brightly-flashing
oars.” The deluge of satiric letters that
followed is still remembered in the office.
“P.X.”: Sydney Telegraph has sold its
splendid but inconvenient home for £305,000;
and if it raced off to the shareholders with
that money and what there is in the till
they would get over £1 per share ; and there
would be the plant and the paper stock, etc..
and the book debts left over. Seeing that
dividends have been scarce lately, the direc-
tors must be tempted to make a present
splash and blow the future. It recalls the
old days of the Australian Star, which
had been in very low water for many years.
At one shareholders’ meeting J. M. Sanders,
the general manager—he went to the Bar
afterwards —trying to buck shareholders up.
explained that, though they hadn’t made
profits, they were really in a fine position,
having about £30,000 worth of paper m
stock. Whereupon a small, shrill voice - cany
from the back: “Wheugli! For Heaven’s
sake let’s sell it before we spoil it!”
“Count Drolatique”: Edgar Wallace,
author of “The Ringer,” the gaudy dramatisa-
tion whereof is drawing the flappers to
Melbourne Royal, has become so affluent that
he recently declined an American magazine
offer of £12,000 p.a. for one short story a
month over a period of five years. Wallace,
who now lives in Regent’s Park, London, writ-
ing his thrillers behind hermetically-sealed
doors, has sampled practically every form
of humility on the Inky Way. Originally a
soldier, he had his best time as war-corres-
pondent in South Africa. Followed depress-
ing periods as editor of papers that never
grew up. one of which was Town Topics.
staffed by several old Pink ’Un favorites after
John Corlett sold the Sporting Times. But
detective fiction has made him a wealthy man
and nowadays he gives weekly parties at the
Carlton.
“Feng-Shui”: Melbourne Truth has had
the unusual experience of being taken seri-
Dusly. The Soerabaiash-Handelsblad. one
of the leading journals in Java, devotes one
and a half columns to a refutation of a
story which appeared in John Norton s relic
telling how an innocent Victorian girl was
lured to Sourabaya to become the white slave
of a Dutch planter; how she escaped, only
to fall into the clutches of the Sultan or
DjOkja. Poor Sultan! He would have as
much chance of secreting Australian ffu s
from the lynx-eye of Dutch authority as an <
Stonehaven would have of maintaining .
ballet of Javanese ronggengs at Yarralumia.
The Sourabaya journal works itselr into a
tine fret over the Australian paper s « s
the Dutchman’s truly splendid hospitality to
strangers, and recommends reprisa s
form of passport restrictions.

“The Ghost Train,” which arrived at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday, features an assorted
lot of passengers dumped at night into a
gloomy and comfortless railway waiting-room
and falling into a tangle of mystery that
keeps them on top notes and the audience
thrilled for a whole evening. The furnace
and window lights of the train which brought
them can be seen passing beyond the windows
of the waiting-room whilst 27 stage-hands
(according to a credible managerial asser-
tion) produce noises in the background like
a railway-station when business is brisk. It
is a bit of good stagecraft; and from the
moment the unseen caravan rattles out again
the train of creepy dramatic action moves
forward, with a good spicing of comedy. The
passengers are marooned for the night, their
train having failed to link with the one which
was to have carried them on; and when a
disobliging railway official, Saul Hodgkin,
tells the tale about the ghost train alleged
to rattle through the station at midnight
whilst its grisly occupants react a 20-year-old
tragedy, tile creeps start. They intensify
(long after the narrator has cleared out, de-
claring that he would not remain on the
station for a fortune) as the story begins to
react itself, commencing with the arrival of
an apparently dead body at the waiting-room
door and climbing to heights of eeriness as the
Flying Dutchman of the metals rushes past
the windows. The mystery is cleared up in
a quite materialistic fashion, the denouement
being clever and unexpected ; and the audi-
ence, doubtless, goes home happy in the
knowledge that the evening’s events have
straightened out the domestic troubles of two
couples. There is, of course, no reason why
thp man who turns out to be a detective
should foolishly scare the people he wants
to remain on the station ; but incongruities
are bound to crop up in even the best mystery
stories.
* * * *
Hugh E. Wright presents a fine character
study, in language which sounds good Cornish,
of a sinister stationmaster; Basil Radford is
realistic as the purposeful person who poses
as the silly ass, Teddy Drakin ; and the old
maid with the parrot shown by Laura Smith-
son successfully weathers the handicap of
some out-of-date humor. Of the others Betty
Ross-Clark is dramatic as the supposedly mad
Julia, and Mayne Lynton crisp as the dis-
illusioned year-old husband. “The Ghost
Train” ran for 17 weeks in Melbourne; on
its merits it should draw its freight of mys-
tery for a good season in Sydney.
❖* * *
Saturday will see two new arrivals at
Sydney theatres. “Madame Pompadour” will
introduce powder and patches, laces and Bep-
pie de Yries to the Theatre Royal, where
Marie Burke says her farewell to-morrow
(Friday) night in “Katja,” staged for the
last three nights of the season, with Warde
Morgan playing his old part. He made his
first re-appearance in “Frasquita” last week,
and was given the reception accorded a con-
quering hero. At the St. James, “The Sheik”
displaces Carter the Great; the management
promises a spectacular production of the
tale exploited by the late Rudolph Valentino.
* * # *
A benefit matinee for Warde Morgan will
be given at Her Majesty’s on Friday
(to-morrow) afternoon, when doubtless a
sympathetic public will throw in its guineas
as eagerly as the theatricals in Sydney have
offered tlieir services—and there is not one
of them whose services were not available.
Apart from the cause, there ought to be a
full money’s worth in the entertainment.
Nellie Stewart will be the star, playing
Trilby to the Svengali of the soundly-artistie
Gaston Mervale; and there will be repre-
sentatives of every show-house in Sydney
with specially-selected items.
This afternoon (Thursday) Paderewski is
giving Sydney its last opportunity of hear-
ing what a piano can be made to say. It
is a perfectly special and gift occasion ; the
proceeds will go to the children of Austra-
lians who gave their lives in the war, a
generous thought of the great pianist.
Hilarity still dances in “Tip Toes” at
Sydney Her Majesty’s; Gus Bluett has
amply justified the courage of the J.C.W.
firm in pushing him into the lead. Shifted
over to the Palace, “Cradle Snatchers” re-
mains as cheerful a farce as ever. “Sunny,”
the new edition, will see June out, at least ;
the Empire Theatre people are getting “The
Student Prince” in readiness for July. Inci-
dentally, all Australasian rights in “Sunny”
outside of Sydney have been sold to the
Fullers for £BOOO. At the Grand Opera
House the process of “Getting Gertie’s Gar-
ter” is still keeping large audiences in thor-
oughly cheerful mood.
* * * *
What this Showman thinks about Sean
O’Casey’s “Juno and the Paycock” will have
to wait until next week. The piece was
due to be staged by the Playbox people in
the little liowe-street theatre last night;
and any people who stage a new show on
Wednesday cheat themselves of The
Bulletin’s comments for one week.
* * * *
On Thursday and Friday of next week
(June 9 and 10), with a matinee on the
first day, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”
will be produced at the Conservatorium
under the auspices of the Shakspearean
Society and the direction of Arthur Green-
away. The veteran Australian actor's know-
ledge of Shakspearean production is quite
sufficient to guarantee the effectiveness of
the show. Over 30 years ago he was in
the Rignold production of the comedy which
a visiting critic declared to be the best he
had seen anywhere in the world. Green-
away, who was Demetrius in the long-ago
show in which George Rignold was Bottom,
will, of course, play the part that was then
enacted by “the guv’nor.”
* * * *
Sydney Town Hall is becoming almost a
continuous music-box nowadays. On the
heels of Paderewski and Heifetz comes Ignaz
Friedman, a Polish pianist. His season com-
mences on Saturday week. And on his heels
will come Zimbalist, who had a remarkable
greeting in M.L. Zimbalist’s arrival will
start the ball rolling for the new Concert
Tours, Ltd.
S}c »jc -Sjc
Foley and Iris, who have won special
approval at Fullers’, are saying good-bye
this week; but the Charleston Band, the
Statler sisters, and Alec Ivellaway continue
popular in the house which has Stiffy and
Mo for its star boarders. The particular
mess the pair fall into this week is called
“Get In,” which seems to be a relative,
many times removed by farcical representa-
tion, of O. Henry’s “Soapy Smith,” the
man who wanted to get into gaol but
couldn’t. A burlesquing of “The Prisoner’s
Song” serves that dish of tripe with some
good humorous sauce.
“CORNERED," AT MELBOURNE
PRINCESS.
Desmond MeMinn as George Wells , the
tallest stage hero in captivity. Harvey
Adams, as the crook .ferry the Gent,
arrives with them all on.
A new arrival at the Tivoli is the “Pas-
tille Ballet,” in which dainty little Nola
Reid and Nina Devitt essay to interpret “The
Spirit of Youth.” Dick Henderson, that
amiable machine-gun of mirth, continues to
score with each shot of his quick-fire comedy :
and Herbert Williams continues his cheerful
buffoonery, good enough stuff but. liable to
become monotonous. Apparently these
imported vaudevillains expect to travel the
world on the back of one act. There is
nothing remarkable about the dancing of
Farrell and Massey; but two performers who
seem to be growing old on the Tivoli circuit,
Henri French and Stetson, the man who
throws hats about, make a welcome re-
appearance.
Out of the rut of conventional film stories is
“The Red Mill,” at Hoyt’s ( Sydney), a picture
of Holland in its mantle of ice, with Gretchen,
a kitchen wench, masquerading as a high-
born lady. Here is genuine humor in quaint
situations, with the eeriness of the haunted
red mill to make a sensational climax. The
plot is simple and pleasing; Marion Davies
makes a delightful Gretchen; and not the
least important character is Ignatz, a white
mouse played by itself. The Cinderella motif
is a permanent stand-by for the plot-manu-
facturers.
* * * *
Hollywood is failing us; England is off
the map; and the Australian picture industry
is yet to be. The new film releases this week
are dreary and machine-made. The best
pictures on view are not new. “The Golden
Road,” at the Adyar Hall, remains by
far the most artistic show in Sydney; “Old
Ironsides,” at the Prince Edward, recalls the
gallant days of fighting frigates; but “The
Volga Boatmen,” at the Crystal Palace, loses
its- punch by its inordinate length. The new
films include “Sir Lumberjack,” with a pic-
turesque setting of tall timber; and “The
Man of the Forest” re-hashes all the well-
worn thrills of the alleged American outback.
“LAUCHMA KERB,”
AT SYDNEY
TIVOLI.
Hcrbert Williams, the American Life Guard
buffoon, and Dick Henderson, the Eng-
lish comedian.
A batch of Sydney art shows: —
Brilliancy in the English section is a marked
feature of the work of the Australian Painter-
Etchers’ Society at the Department of Education
Gallery; Percival Gaskell’s “Mad King’s Castle”
shows some remarkable treatment of lights,
and F. V. Burridge some fine contrasts of stark light
and shadow in “Blacksmith’s Forge.” Among the
Australians are a batch of students whose work has
probably been included as an encouragement, although
one or two items would deserve a place in any show.
Amongst the veterans an aquatint by Syd Long, “Fan-
tasy,” stands out for its decorative effect and imagi-
nation ; Will Ashton has four pleasant Continental
themes; A. H. Fullwood, a view of Hunter-street
which will remind the S. M. Herald that it only
recently lived in a bam, and John Shirlow two
attractively and conscientiously worked pictures of
Melbourne. C. H. Percival’s “Last Train” contains
some effective work; “East is West” best shows
R. W. Coulter; and Jessie Traill follows her remark-
able penchant for interpreting the poetry of
engineering in “Building the Harbor Bridge.” Squire
Morgan, T. Friedensen and H. Van Raalte are the
most notable contributors amongst the ruck.
Any Harold Herbert picture is what a moneylender
would call sound security. Few men know better
how to use water-color, and the knowledge is wedded
to a fine decorative and color sense. The exhibition
opening to-day at the Macquarie Galleries is an
essentially pleasing one; the only fault to be found
is a certain lack of enterprise which suggests that
the artist, having struck a safe line of art with an
immediate marketable value, is disinclined to venture
further.
Swain’s Gallery has an often amusing, always pleas-
ant show of water-colors and drawings by Dorothy
Wall, whose imagination runs riot for the entertain-
ment of children. Bees wearing boots, hats, and strange
garments supply the characters for the humorous
fantasies; the travesties of human life must please
even adults. It is only when the artist tries to be
serious that she fails.
* * *
“Six-Cylinder Love” made overtures to a
small but highly susceptible audience at Mel-
bourne King’s on Saturday. The curtain
rises on two American suburban backyards,
separated by a fence. The left-hand yard is
populated by a family which has already
been ruined by the time-payment disease;
the right-hand one by a newly-married couple
ripe for catching it. In the middle distance,
arrogantly twirling its moustache, so to
speak, glitters the villain of the piece, a
motor-car. The expensive and devilishly hand-
some object is withdrawn after the first act
but it continues (to dominate the story
from off-stage.
* * * *
The simple but direct and diverting comedy
is consistently well written. It is capably-
acted by Hale Norcross, Richard Taber and
company. Taber, as the automobile’s second
victim, left no tone unturned to express the
contrariety of his emotions. The small
man’s droll, hesitating buffoonisliness touched
real life in as many places as a farce rob
would let it. Mary Ellen Hanley dressed the
wife’s itch for an expensive life without
regard to consequences in a high voice and
an ingenue manner of some fidelity. Frank
Leighton, Douglas Vigors and Noel Boyd assi-
duously made raids on the husband’s pocket,
and John Fernside intercepted many of the
laughs as a 60-h.p. motor salesman. No
fault could be found with the production, and
the motor-car, especially when it knocked
down the dividing-fence between the families,
acted perfectly.
:Jc A * *
With some of his audience almost sitting
on his knee, Paderewski gave a final Back-
Beethoven-Schubert-Chopin recital at Mel-
bourne Auditorium on Thursday afternoon.
Without once opening his mouth or even
altering the expression of his face, the vene-
rable pianist has established relations of
positive affection with his hearers. At one
concert a stout lady dying of starvation rum-
maged so noisily and persistently for a
chocolate-cream that the virtuoso walked ofl
the platform in a pet, but this wasn’t re-
garded by the crowd as a display of artistic
“temperament” but an indication that he
intended that all should have an equal
chance of getting their full money’s worth
The procession of encores at the farewell

Beethoven was lucky in having the distin-
guished patronage of the Federal and State
Governors for his first full-dress orchestral
commemorative concert in Melbourne, which
was provided by Bernard Heinze and his Uni-
versity symphonists at the Auditorium. Even
musically considered, the entertainment was
at least as varied as “Rose Marie.” It led off
with a rendering of the Leonore No. 3 Over-
ture from the composer’s one and only and
grievously neglected opera, “Fidelio.” On the
woodwind and the strings Leonore descended
with slow but determined steps to share her
husband’s imprisonment, later emerging with
her spouse in a prolonged paean of rejoicing in
which the whole orchestra participated. The
result was a musical drama of wonderful com-
pleteness and intensity. The conductor even
added a touch of melodrama by sending the
bugler off stage to sound his distant note of
reprieve. The No. 3 Concerto, full of grace,
jollity and argument, followed, with Edward
Goll at his best and brightest at the piano.
Connie Ziebell’s violin, against the ornate
scenery provided by the orchestra, caught the
composer in one of his rare romantic moods,
in the Romance in G. The proceedings were
concluded with the Eroica Symphony, iu
which Beethoven is supposed to have glorified
Napoleon and General Abercromby, probably
beyond their deserts. This last item was
beautifully done. Professor Heinze may be
a trifle belated in the centenary procession,
but he has made up for it in the careful
preparation of his wreath.

10 PER CENT. CUM. PREFERENCE SHARE ISSUE.
This issue is being made for the specific purpose of purchase and erection of a 20-head Stamper
Mill at the Mine, and a Pumping Plant and Pipe Line to supply water for same.
A 15-head Mill, Gas Suction Plant, Electric Pumping Plant and Pipe Line, the whole as a
complete working unit that originally cost £20,000 and is in good order, has. been purchased for the
sum of £lOOO and is now being dismantled for removal to Marranboy.
A further 10-head Stamper Mill with nine Tin Concentrating Tables and Vanners and two large
Grinding Pans has also been purchased.
The present crushing facilities on the field are quite inadequate for the treatment of the tonnage
of ore the mine will produce when working under favorable conditions, or even for its immediate
requirements, and you will see that Mr. Walter Baker, the Chairman of the Board, in his report appended,
strongly recommends the immediate purchase and erection of a 15 to 20-head milling and concentrating
plant
The Plant recently purchased, when erected and fully equipped, will be capable of treating on a
modest estimate 1500 tons a month, or, say, 15,000 tons a year.
It is reasonable to expect a return of 2 per cent, with an efficient plant, as prior to the Company
starting operations 6000 tons have been produced and crushed from this field, and averaged over 3
per cent., and there is no mullock on the field, all material raised having been put through at the Mill.
Our Manager estimates there is a loss of nearly 1 per cent, going away in the sands at the present
treatment plant.
Allowing tin remains in the region of £250 per ton (it is now over £300), and under present
working conditions (which can be economically improved), 2 per cent, ore would yield a net profit
of £1 per ton of ore, and result in a profit of £15,000 per annum.
You will see Mr. Baker estimates 120,000 tons of ore are obtainable from one portion of the
opened-up workings, and the mine at present can be considered to be hardly scratched. The deepest
workings being slightly over 100 feet with ore going down strongly underfoot, and numerous shallow
shafts are down on other portions of our leases, in all of which payable ore is exposed, and in some
of them very rich ore up to 25 per cent, has been located.
During the short period the Company has worked the mines, tin to the value of £2850/8/7 lias
been produced.
REPORT BY MR. WALTER BAKER
Late Dredge Master, Manuka Dredging Co., N.Z.; Perseverance Dredging Co., Vic.; Annan River
Tin Dredging Co., Queensland ; and General Manager of the Palmer River Gold Co., N.L.
Having just returned from a visit to the Marranboy Mines, where I spent several months examining
the property, I have pleasure in reporting:—
MINES. —The main workings are on contract for the delivery of 1000 tons of ore at the Battery,
of which 400 tons have been delivered returning 2 per cent, of Tin.
The face being operated on by the contractor is about 24 feet wide on the south side of the shaft,
and no footwall has been touched yet; the ore on the footvvall side is not nearly equal to that on the
hanging wall side (in value). The ore values in the WHOLE of the face at present are from 2 to
21 per cent., whilst about 5 feet of the face is worth fully 7 per cent..
The main shaft workings are 110 feet deep, and neither foot nor hanging wall has yet been
located. What was originally thought to be the hanging wall has been shot out, and from this our
best ore has been obtained, but under present conditions it would be unsafe to gouge further into
the wall, and until extensive cross-cutting has been carried out it would be unsafe to hazard an opinion
as to the width of the lode at this point; as a matter of fact, the width of any of the lodes on the
leases have not been ascertained in any single instance, and on reference to my sketch map you will
see that the leases are just a network of lodes, all of which show promising prospects.
The lode on which the main shaft is located has been more extensively worked, or perhaps it
would be more correct to say “prospected”—than any other of the different lines of lodes on the leases;
but some of the best crushings have been obtained from the “West lode” from shallow workings and
from various places, and, although our energies are now being concentrated on the main lode, I think
time will prove that the west line of lode will equal, if it does not surpass, the main lode in values.
PROPERTY.—Considering that there are five shafts down on the main line of lode, all of which
have provided highly payable results (all reported results have been authenticated by the Mines Dept,
at Darwin), 1 feel very sure that we have got a property that will be hard to excel.
PROVED GROUND.—There is sufficient ground above the 100 feet level, between the north end
shaft and the south shaft, to provide ore to keep a 15 or 20-head battery going in full swing for from
15 to 20 years on what is now highly payable ore, and I estimate there is a tonnage of 120,000
tons to be obtained between the No. 1 and No. 4 shafts.
GOVERNMENT BATTERY.—This battery was built in 1915. There are now 40 producers on the
field supplying ore to this battery.
PROPOSED COMPANY BATTERY.—I have already stated that the Company possesses a property
that it would be hard to excel, and I repeat this, and T think it would be very bad policy to con-
tinue crushing at the Government Battery a day longer than can possibly be helped.
A crushing of, say, 200 tons at intervals of, say, three months is no good to a Company.
With a well-equipped battery of 15 or 20-head going steadily, the Company would make a profit of
£4OO per week on 1-1 per cent, ore, provided always that tin prices remain at or within ss. per unit
of present price, 565."
The 472 tons crushed whilst I was at the mine was put through in 44 8-hour shifts, for a return
of 8 tons 7cwt. of tin; this at, say, 555. per unit, will realise in the vicinity of £l4OO. The
same tonnage would be crushed with a 15-head battery in 36 shifts, or 12 days of three shifts, at a
total cost not exceeding £5OO.
BATTERY RECORDS.—From the inception of the mine to the time that the Company took the
option over the mine, Mr. Pearce had 6074.33 tons treated at the Government battery for a total tin
concentrate of 213,063 tons, of an average assay value of 65 per cent., the total parcel averaging
3.97405 per cent. (These figures supplied by Mines Department authorities.)
M ATER SUPPLY.-—There is an unfailing supply of water to be had from the “Beswick” Creek,
a distance of 31 miles from the mine, where a battery would be situated.
This would have to bo pumped across fiat country to the mine against a head of from 90 to
100 feet by electric current generated at the battery.
I have applied for a right of 120,000 gallons per day, and am assured that we will have it granted.
BATTERY SITE.—An ideal site is within five chains of the main shaft and on the mine property,
where everything can be worked by gravitation.
MOTIVE POWER.—If the Company decided to put a battery—and in my oninion this must come,
and should be done—l would strongly recommend that we adopt oil as motive fuel in Super-Diesel
Engines, or a Gas Suction Plant.
... ACCESSIBILITY.—The present terminus of the railway is at Katherine, but it is expected that it
will be opened to Marranboy Siding about August of the present year, when the heavy cartage from
the railhead will lie cut out.
tV;^XJ id]r 'Z win then be about ei S' ht nliles from th e mine, with a good hard road connecting.
• V , am c l mte confident that if the Company puts a good battery and plant on the
mine t iat they need never look back. The ore is there in practically unlimited quantities and of
good values; the situation is ideal for getting material from shafts to battery hoppers, and, when the
mine is properly opened up, the ore can be mined at a very cheap rate (mined and hauled for about

EXTRACTS FROM REPORT ON MARRANBOY
By Dr. H. I. JENSEN, D.Sc.
Late Chief Government Geologist and Director of Mines of the Northern Territory.
GENERAL.—The Marranboy Tinfield, discovered nearly fourteen years ago, and situated about
40 miles by road east of Katherine Station, is a tinfield of somewhat unusual features.
The field is about eight miles long in a north-south direction and about five miles wide, and is
crossed by a considerable number of important lodes striking between east-west and east-south-east to
west-south-west. The lodes of the major portion of the field are not pipes and short lenses such as are
generally met with on tmfields, but they are true fissure lodes. This fact gives an assurance of
permanency.
The country rock of the field is a dark, coarse-jointed cherty metamorphic mudstone.
Phe ore is very much harder than is usually the case with tin lodes, but .the black tin recovered
is easily separated and is clean, being seldom contaminated with any trace of other heavy minerals.
PEARCE’S LODES. —Pearce’s Leases, now held by the Marranboy Mining Company, N.L., are in
.-he southern portion of the field. The main lode on these leases has yielded more tin than any other
mine on the field, and has been proven of fair average quality, as Mr. Baker’s report shows both by
the crushings put through by the original owner and the late crushing of 400 tons for the ’Company,
inougn it lacked the showy surface bonanzas thajt occurred in some adjacent lodes it has proved
consistently payable.
Probably several other lodes, if systematically mined, would eventually prove better, but Pearce
was the only miner who came to the field with sufficient capita] to work and develop his ground systemati-
cally. This is an important thing to keep in mind, since a company owning its own battery stands in
a good position at the present time of gradually becoming possessed, at a small cost, of a number of
the best mines and lodes of the field.
the Government battery
NECESSITY OF A BATTERY.—As Mr. Baker has shown in his report,
useless to fill the requirements of the Marranboy Company.
The Marranboy Tinfield is a field of such a permanent character that it will be working for hundreds
ot years, and will be an important mining centre when most of our other tinfields are forgotten The
big lodes crossing the field nearly east-west, like Pearce’s “main lode,” now owned bv the Marranboy
Mming Company, NX., wall live as strong lodes to the depth of a thousand feet or more.
±vr,LAiM MEND ATI ON.—I concur entirely with Mr. Baker in recommending the Company to erect
its own battery and tin-saving appliances, not only because ore supplies are .assured in its present
leases for 2o years, as Mr. Baker has shown, but also because the possession of such a plant will be a
stiong lever to the Company in helping it to acquire other important properties.

One of the most amusing pictures Mel-
bourne has seen in many moons started to
unfold itself at Melbourne Auditorium on
Saturday. The generation that didn’t live
through the war has to discard a multitude
of conceptions before it can appreciate the
emotions latent in “The Better ’Ole,” Bruce
Bairnsfather’s once world-famous creation.
Yet the walrus-whiskered warrior, who shakes
off a ton of earth deposited on him by a
six-inch shell only to make a music-hall mot,
is probably a truer version of the private
soldier through the ages than the version
given in the histories and the speeches of
Armistice Day orators; the chance are there
were Ole Bills among the Spartans at Ther-
mopylae in 480 B.c. Syd Chaplin as the hero
of the British film under discussion is as
lifelike a reproduction of Bairnsfather’s origi-
nal absurdity as is celluloidly possible, and the
show is a riot of laughter from start to
finish.
Melbourne Tivoli management is satisfied
with the impersonations of Alexander Carr,
the burlesquings of the Joyers, the acrobatics
of the six Gallenos and the beautiful muscles
of the Stavany pair, and the public seems
satisfied too. Accretions to a strong bill are
Sydney Burchel and Marie Lawton, the
latter blest with a large harp, an ample
voice and a not inconsiderable person.

Jessie Traill has brought a collection of
European cathedrals, bridges and other
natural features to the New Gallery. This
lady’s enthusiasm for sketching anything and
everything is infectious. She takes pot-shots
at the visible world with the opti-
mism of a child with its first Kodak.
Her draughtsmanship is keen. She is
never moody about the weather or daunted
by the intricacies of a Gothic pulpit, and
she can put two towns, a river and a range
of mountains in a picture without conspicu-
ous overcrowding. The difficulties of the
etching medium reduce her to a soberer state,
and some of her efforts with the needle are
thoroughly poetic. One in particular may
not be legitimately etching, but the touches
of blue and crimson in the stained-glass
window are distinctly fetching.
“The Ghost Train” has steamed away
from Adelaide Royal, and “The Green Hat”
will be on view next week. A revival of
“Sunday” is drawing good houses to the
Prince of Wales, with piquant Hilda Dor-
rington making havoc in the hearts of four
adoring miners, Guy Hastings, Jack Mc-
Gowan, Victor Fitzherbert and Ronald Riley,
and George Cross in the more imposing part
of Colonel Bi'inthorpe. At the Majestic
Arthur Buckley and his wife are engaged
in the gentle art of mystifying, the blind-
folded lady handing out dates, numbers and
other private matters with uncanny accuracy.
Fantasi is a clever girl contortionist, Sam
Stern gives a humorous burlesque of Italian
opera, and “My Island of Dreams” shows
no depreciation in the quality of the revues
supplied by Gayle Wyer. At West’s “The
Better ’Ole” continues to hold the screen,
and Ole Bill is becoming a prime favorite
among juvenile picture fans. “Lost at Sea”
is providing sensation at the Wondergraph.
“The Prince of Pilsen” at the Grand is
a merry burlesque of the Ruritanian style,
Hans Wagner, wearing the uniform of the
Loyal Order of American Squirrels, being
mistaken for the Prince of Pilsen. It is
bright comedy all through, with George Sid
ney. Anita Stewart. Allan Forrest and
Myrtle Stedman in the leads. At the Vic-
toria Hall the Adelaide Repertory Theatre
is about to give three performances of Somer-
set Maugham’s “The Circle.”

Herbert R. Gallop has crossed over from
Sydney to the Sedon Galleries with some
charming if unequal versions of the climate
of N. S. Wales. The general effect is praise-
worthy but there are blind spots in the
artist’s vision. He works well ufider the
stimulus of strong color harmonies and con-
trasts, but his attention is apt to wander
from the subtler problems of tone. For in-
stance, he looked frankly at the vivid patch
of vines in No. 11 but very apologetically at
the accompanying cows. “Evening Sunlight
on the Swamp” is decorative and “The White
Boathouse” is as charmingly variegated as
the seat of a sundowner’s pants.
“Clive Brook”: In Nellie Stewart’s recent
revival of “Sweet Nell” in Sydney, King
Charles’s little page was Joan Paxton. Joan’s
father, now a burly man. was the page in
the original production 25 years ago. His
mother, Joan’s grandma, was then Sweet
Nell’s dresser, as she was in the late out-
break.
Poverty
Point
"Billo” : Roland Conway, recently appear-
ing with Nellie Stewart in Melbourne and
Sydney, knows the game from proscenium
to paint-frame, but once I saw him get
horribly tied up. In “Face to Face,” Roland,
as the hero, had to say, “Now to start the
search for Hetty.” What he did say was
“Now to starch the shirt for Hetty.” Play-
wrights should be more careful. I have
heard a slightly sozzled mummer make a
shocking mess of “Give the girl the gig whip.”
It’s hard enough to say it sober.
“Lever de Rideau” : Judith Anderson has
artlessly confessed to the Melbourne press
that it was not by her wish, but by the
management’s, that she appeared before her
fellow-countrymen as a bad woman in two
plays. “I had never played such a charac-
ter,” she says, “until I did ‘Cobra’ in
America ; and I did not at first wish to take
it.” Now she has discovered that Austra-
lians like only clean, wholesome plays, and
if she comes back she will know what to do.
It is all very unconvincing. Miss Judith
was predestined to be a stage vamp. She
has the vamp face, the vamp voice and the
vamp languidness of deportment. However
much she may yearn to be a Marcia, she
is fated to continue, histrionically speaking,
to be an Iris March.
“R.K.D.N.” : “The Student Prince,” which
is to succeed “Sunny” at Sydney Empire
when a successor is needed, is an American
musicomedy version of “Old Heidelberg.”
Though it has made a fortune for the Schu-
berts in New York, it flopped in _ London
through miscasting. Big Bob Greig is in the
New York cast, providing most of the comedy
relief in a fat part.
“Hamfat”: Australian Mabs Howarth was
doing some kid stuff at Sydney Tivoli.
“Babies have to be bought, of course,” was
her line ; “but what puzzles me is that ( the
poorest people buy the most babies.” “Too
right!” came a pathetic voice from the gal-
lery. . .
“Caul Boy”: Harold Bowden, the Firm s
buyer in America, has been breathlessly tell-
ing Melbourne of the horrors of theatre-
going in New r York. The world s latest
theatrical metropolis—it has upwards of 151)
“legitimate” playhouses as against Ixmdon s
50 —is, it appears, sunk in incredible filth,
from which Mr. Bowden succeeded in sal-
vaging half a dozen respectable musicomedies
and farces for us. Still, if America is _so
obsessed with ordure that it is well-nigh
impossible to get good plays from there,
it is strange that U.S. producers should
risk money oii scores of new plays by indi-
genous authors, like Eugene O’Neill, George
Kelly and Anderson and Tully, men with
serious intentions. Perhaps the Firm’s man
wasn’t looking for plays such as O’Neill and
Kelly write.
“Whitelights” : Hilda Spong, whose success
on Broadway has lately been handicapped
by her weight, is trying a thinning-down
process in order to retain her place in
American public favor. Eel-like slimness
is now the cardinal virtue.
"Hamfat”: In Phil Eytton’s spectacular
production of “The Sheik’’ one of the desert
scenes stands out. Instead of the usual back-
cloth and wings, a panorama cloth half-
circling the stage space will give a limitless
view of desert surroundings. Camels, mules
and donkeys will impart a livestock interest
to the show, and the bazaar at Bon Saedi
will vie with the desert dust-storm for effec-
tiveness. The management considers that
Australian actor Rutland Beckett will get
the chance of his life as Sheik Omair. AN itli
one or two importations the cast will be
mainly Australian.
“The Doorkeeper": Little Duncan Mac-
dougall in Octave Mirbeau’s “Business is
Business” had to resort to padding when
playing the enormous financier. He wanted
a photograph of himself in the part, and
called on a photographer. In the midst of
the preparations he was interrupted by a mem-
ber of his company, carrying a large parcel.
“What’s this?” demanded Macdougall. “Your
stummick!” He had forgotten his pillows.
“Bouragi”: Brisbane is to have a new
Williamson-Tait theatre on the southern side
of Queen-street extending to Elizabeth-street.
It is designed in two tiers only, and will
include an organ, which suggests pictures.
“Flaming Youth”: Alf Frith, who queered
a pitch worth over a hundred per week in
Australia, has found no bed of roses in the
United States. He made a personal success
in “The Lace Petticoat” in New York; but.
even lace petticoats are too modest for
Broadway, and the play failed. Harry Rad-
cliffe, a minor performer in Australia in
companies wherein Frith was star comedian,
is with Ziegfeld’s “Rio Rita.” Maie Baird
and Archie Thompson, after a success in
the Greenwich Village F'ollies, passed on to
England. Ethel Morrison, already doing
well, has been booked with engagements for
still better tilings. A stage presentation of
“Pickwick” is keeping Harry Plimmer pros-
perous ; and Harry Sweeney has struck it
lucky in “Lucky.” An old friend of Australia
who has met witli misfortune is Emeiie
Polini. Booked for New York after a
Chicago success with two pieces, she had a
nervous breakdown.
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: I was present on the
night that the Sydney Lyceum—it was iii
the days before Ebenezer Vickery made a
present of it to the Methodists —had its
greatest excitement. The machinations of
the villain had reduced the hero to dissipa-
tion and ruin, and he was pressing his atten-
tions upon the distressed hero-whine when
a muscular figure heaved itself over the
orchestra rails and leaped across to the foot-
lights. “I’ll chuck the dirty cow out fer
you, missus,” he growled. The next moment
the villain was sent hurtling into the
orchestra. “And that waster of a husband
of yours ain’t no good to you neither, mis-
sus,” the intruder went on. “Why don t you
leave him slide, and go fer a divorce?” The
police helped to throw him out; but the
MacMalions subsequently boasted that th"
incident was worth £lOO in improved houses.
“John’s Wood” (Bond.) : The particular
interest to Australians in the opening of
the new London theatre, the Carlton, lies
in the inclusion of Madge Elliott, Cyril
Ritchard and Josie Melville in the cast.
Madge’s work delighted the first-night house,
and with Cyril Ritchard she made a re-
markable hit. • .Tosie has little to do, but
does it well. The new theatre, styled the
most beautiful in London, is only a few yards
from the Haymarket. There is no pit.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : C. B. Cochran’s latest
stunt is to omit the critics from first nights,
inviting them several days later, “because
first-night critiques mislead the public.” The
idea is that the show is quite a different
thing on the third or fourth night, when
everything is working smoothly. One of the
“damned” acidly remarks: “Docs Mr. Cocn-
ran want us to attend the first performance,
and then write a notice on what we believe
the fifth performance may look like? ’
“Curtain Raiser” : Managers and producers
aren’t always as distressed by adverse com-
ment about their stars as one would expect.
Sometimes, in fact, they positively rejoice.
An internecine war goes on behind the scenes
between the “temperamental” artist, jealous
of his fame, and the business man who makes
money out of it. A timely blast from the
press may not affect his box-office receipts so
much as it reduces the pretensions of the
star. „ , , ..
“Irving Phelps”: “The Fires of St. John
was done in Melbourne 25 years ago by
Nance O’Neill. Playgoers of that time were
somewhat staggered to behold Nance as a
Prussian peasant girl in the throes of love,
followed by a black-out —an episode reminis-
cent of a scene in the recent stage version of
“The Green Hat.” I shall be interested to
see how young Mr. Fowler handles that
scene without inviting the guffaws of the
populace. It is a curiosity of the gallery m
Australia that it can never look on anything
ostentatiously naughty without giggling.
Consider, for example, the sniggers when
Judith Anderson started twining herself
about her bloke in the Sydney presentation
of “Cobra.” f
“Wesnrac”: The lines quoted by “All
Gee” (B. 12/5/’27), and alleged by a Lon-
don Times reviewer to be an excerpt from
an Australian ballad, are, as he suggests, a
parody on “Redwing.” When, as kids, we
used to beef it out on the road home from
school it ran something like this: —
Oh the moon shines bright on Mrs. Porter
And so it orter,
For she’s a snorter.
She washes her feet in soapy water,
So does her daughter,
Because they hum.
After that it began to get a little personal.
THE BALLADE OF THE UNNECES-
SARY COME-BACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cats and curses return, they say.
There’s no denying the truth of that;
Unwanted things can’t be given away,
And thus it happens the curse and the cat
Are very soon back on the owner’s mat.
The cat knows by instinct the homeward
track
And the curse knows the man who itself
begat,
But why do they all keep coming back?
That ingrained habit we cannot slay,
It has spread like a plague from the flea
and the rat
To the heroes who bask in the limelight ray
And the slapstick merchants of song and
chat.
The curtain has fallen, you reach for your
hat,
But the rag’s up again with a rustle and
smack.
They left to applause that was faint and
flat;
Now why do they always keep coming back?
For the man at the curtain it’s no kiddies’
play;
The manager buzzes about like a gnat.
“Principals !” “Company !” Never a stay.
THE FLAW IN THE ARGUMENT.
THE ADVISER: “Why don't yon have your stuff typewritten? You'd then get a much better
idea of how it would look in print."
THE ASPIRANT: “Yes; but so would the editors."
“Star alone!" He knows what he s at.
Sit. down again in the seat where you sat
And bear your load like a patient hack.
Ye gods, the star makes a speech! (That's
his “fat.”)
Is this why he always keeps coming back?
Envoy.
Stars and near ones with speeches so pat,
I must sit out your “curtains” and clap-
trap, alack!
This is all my revenge, a mere child's tit-
for-tat:
Oh why will you always keep coming-
back ?

That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated
regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet soaps
influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the
dencate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse: they
tect the skin. ' * *
Rexona Soap contains the same
soothing, healing, antiseptic Balsams
as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the
value of which in the treatment of
skin affections is known throughout
the world. Simply use Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap regularly once

not quickly soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the tendency to pimples,
and leave the complexion clear,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE grey dawn wind awoke the sleeping
roses
In a loved garden, wafting their perfume
With little shaken gusts of sudden sweetness
To that dim-slirouded room,
Where they were gathered, all my loved
ones, round me
To tell me, speaking low,
That which in all the lonely years behind me
I had so longed to know.
All their deep gratitude, their fond affection,
Their knowledge of my care—
The tender, loving words so long unspoken
I heard them, lying there.
I heard, and could not speak one word of
comfort,
Lying beneath the piled-up lilies white;
I could not tell them of my soul’s elation
Because —I died last night!
QUEENSLAND.
ALICE GUERIN CRIST.
La Popa.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LUCIA turned on them with flashing eyes.
They were laughing at her. ”La popa,
* popa!” they shouted merrily, as Lucia
tried to hide the doll in her arms.
She was a peasant girl from a far-away
village in Calabria, and they were always
laughing at her strange, wild ways. But
fancy Lucia, the wild girl, whose outbursts
of passion sometimes frightened her sophisti-
cated sister, carrying a doll! They'had to
laugh.
It was such a quaint doll Lucia had
bought, an Italian peasant playing the bag-
pipes, with bright trousers and ox-liide leg-
gings and a big straw hat on his head; a
real little mountaineer dressed up for a
festa, She saw it three weeks ago, and
however expensive it might be she had to
have it. So one night, with her little savings,
she went into the big shop and put her
money 011 the counter. She had no words
of English, but she made signs till the right
doll was brought. It was beautifully painted,
and how life-like! Just like the young men
she remembered in her own village, just
like Luigi before he came to Australia. When
she got home she hid it at the bottom of
a box in her little room. She knew how
her sister and her new friends would all
laugh at her if they saw the doll. Their
ways were different. They were quite at
home now in the big, new city; but Lucia
was still a peasant girl and a stranger
among them.
She came out to her married sister when
her grandmother died. Most of the young
people were leaving their villages and sailing
for America, the Argentine, Australia. But
it was a strange life for Lucia, who was
dazed with the roar of the streets after her
lonely mountain village. She stayed with
her sister Maria, whose husband, Giuseppe,
had a shop with many rooms above it. His
brother and his wife lived with them ; there
was also his old mother, besides three small
children. Giuseppe, who was now called
Joe by everybody, was doing well as an
importer of Italian delicacies. The men who
came to the shop had hard faces, and instead
of singing themselves they listened to an
American gramophone. They all seemed to
be turned out of a machine, and Luigi was
getting like the rest of them. This clean-
shaven young man, in his smart tweed suit
and green felt hat, was this the ragged
Luigi she knew as a boy tending goats on
the hills!
Lucia was betrothed to Luigi, who had
been her sweetheart from childhood. Four
years ago he sailed for Australia, and now
she had come out to marry him. It was
worth crossing the strange seas to meet
Luigi again! A smart young man met her
on the wharf, and the same smart young man
still came to see her in Joe’s shop. Was
this her Luigi? He had changed in four
years, but everything had changed. She
was bewildered in this new world. She
hated it. Oh, how she hated it!
But she had her doll. Her doll was Luigi.
She would sit for hours on her bed alone with
her doll. But Maria had found it, and there
was great merriment in the house. Lucia
with a doll, and such a funny little popa, all
dressed up like an Italian mountaineer, and
playing the bagpipes! Let them laugh at
her, now they had discovered her secret.
She could always escape from them to her
little room and talk to her doll. Her doll
was the real Luigi.
Lucia had been three months in Austra-
lia. She was nineteen, a tall, strong girl
who wore a bright dress of green and gold
with an orange scarf on her head. Her skin
was olive-tinted, and she had slanting eye-
brows, full lips and dazzling white teeth.
Her dark hair hung in ringlets over her fore-
head, and her eyes had the color of a dark,
gleaming wine. But Luigi was embarrassed
with her wild and primitive beauty. He
called on her now only two or three nights
in the week, and he felt nervous and uneasy
m her presence. Lucia soon discovered the
reason for it. He was going out with
another girl. It was Angelina. She had
never seen Angelina, but Maria knew all
about her; she was a pretty girl, who worked
m a factory, wore short skirts and put paint
and powder on her cheeks.
Lucia made no attempt to conceal her
jealousy. She blazed with anger, and
neroely denounced her faithless lover. But
Luigi only shrugged his shoulders and
laughed lightly. She was only a peasant
girl a contadina, unused to the ways of the
world.
It is not to laugh !” she cried hotlv. “A
curse may fall on you.”
Luigi stayed away from the house. A
week passed, and he hadn’t called. He
would be out with Angelina. But Joe came
mme one night with the news that Luigi
had fallen suddenly ill. it was influenza,
Lie doctor said. Lucia smiled darkly.
Lots of people have influenza at this time
e the year, said Joe. “Luigi is a strong
toiiow, and will soon recover.”
But Lucia was done with Luigi. She
telt nothing but bitter hatred for her former
lover. She never wanted to see him again.
Let him die, and go to Hell! One night she
slipped out of the house with the doll under
her arm, passed through the noisy streets
of the unfamiliar city, crossed the bridge
and walked slowly along the banks of the
river. She saw young couples walking arm
in arm, so happy, so trustful; but the heart
of man was deceitful, and she knew that
in a little while many of them, too, would
prove unfaithful. She looked at her doll,
her Luigi. “Basta!” she muttered, “Son
of a bandit!” as she slipped down the bank
to the edge of the river. She looked round
suspiciously, but no one was in sight; then
she hid the doll carefully among the stones
and reeds —she, would remember the place.
When she returned along, the quiet river-
bank, a young man said something to her
she didn’t understand; but she gave him
such a look of scorn and anger that he
quickly walked away under the trees. She
got home at last, and threw herself on the
bed, convulsed with passion, and uttering
terrible threats at Luigi.
Luigi continued to get worse. The doctor
attending him didn’t know what to make
of it. “It’s like that Avith influenza,” re-
marked Joe sagely.
“Influenza!” the old mother mocked him.
Then she rose from her chair with her hand
uplifted in warning. “It’s Lucia,” she said
in a low voice. “She has bewitched him.”
“Lucia!” They shook tlieir heads incredu-
lously.
“Her grandmother was a witch,” the old
woman went on solemnly. “People were in
fear of her malizia. She was known for
miles round the village.”
“We’re in Melbourne/’ said Joe, “not in
the wilds of Italy.”
But his mother was serious. “You are no
longer Italians,” she said scornfully. “You
no understand. You no understand anything.
Her grandmother was a mag a,' I tell you.
She make charms, and people grow sick and
die. She had the gift of magic, and she
teach Lucia.”
“All silly nonsense,” said the soft, good-
natured Joe.
“Where the doll!” cried his mother. “Let
me see the doll!”
No one heeded the old woman’s words, but
Maria promised to ask Lucia for it. But
there was no doll to see. It had disappeared.
Maria was surprised. The old woman mum-
bled to herself, but Lucia would say nothing.
She kept her own secret. No one could
laugh at her now for having a funny little
popa. She was done with her doll. She
was done with Luigi.
But next day her face turned pale as
wax when she heard that Luigi had sent a
message wanting to see her. He was very ill.
and perhaps he was going to die. Would
Lucia come?
She hurried to his room where he was
lying in bed, weak and suffering. He still
looked handsome with his clear-cut features,
dark eyes and black curly hair. As she
came near he turned and smiled, and, taking
her hand, whispered: “Forgive me, Lucia.
I have been bad.”
Lucia looked closely at him. He was very
weak. He might be going to die.
“I lost my head over Angelina,” lie said,
“but that is finished. It was a mistake.,
It’s you I want, Lucia, only you.”
“Madre di Dio!” murmured Lucia.
“I wish I could get better,” sighed Luigi.
“I leave shop. Bottega no good. I no sell
fruit, I grow fruit. I want orchard of my
own. You wil] be my wife, cara mia, and
the mother of my children. We will have
many children, and life will be all right
then.”
Lucia burst into tears. Had she, too,
made a mistake, and blamed him too much
for a light and passing fancy! Here was
her own Luigi, and they were lovers again,
dreaming of a life in the country, among
vines and orange groves, with blue skies and
sunshine as in Italy, and a glimpse through
the trees of a bright, blue sea.
“Sleep, sleep, Luigi,” she whispered, as
his head slipped back on the pillow. Luigi
was pale and weak, but now sleeping peace-
fully. She had to hurry away. Perhaps
there was yet time to save him.
Joe’s mother was right. Lucia knew she had
bewitched him. She had learned the secret
from her old grandmother who knew how
to cast spells. Lucia could do the same. She
had no pity for a faithless lover, and she
would have a terrible revenge. So one night
she had taken her peasant doll she had
named Luigi, and stuck a pin in it. Would
Luigi feel the pang! She shuddered as if
she felt the pain in her own body. But she
was relentless, and every day she had put
in another pin. It was old magic, but there
was a blood bond between them, and Luigi
could not resist it. She wondered if the
charm would work, but it had worked too
well. Every day he grew worse, and tin;
doctor could do nothing for him. “Let him
die!” Lucia used to mutter to herself. “He
deserves to die.” That was why, when the
doll was full of pins, she had gone down to
the river one night and hid it among the
reeds. If they had seen the doll in the house
with the pins in it they would have known
that it was she who was killing him. But
could she find the doll again? The only
way to save him was to get the doll back.
What she had done, she alone could undo.
She made straight for the river, fear and
hope fighting in her heart. Her first im-
pulse had been to throw it into the current
of the river, but perhaps unconsciously she
felt she might yet want to recover it. She
knew the spot where she had put it, but
where was the doll ? Tt might have been
washed away. Luigi would die. She must
save him. She must find the doll and take
out the pins.
Her keen eyes searched everywhere, and
Santa Maria, there it was, her popa, hidden
in the reeds!
“Luigi! Luigi!” she cried, stretching for-
ward to grasp it with a cry of triumph. Tie.
was saved! Gasping, crying, she snatched
out the fatal pins.
Quick, quick, her head reeled, and oh,
she was slipping, falling, per Vamor di Dio!
* * * *
There was consternation in the house
when Lucia did not return. But next morn-
ing they heard that Luigi had made a sur-
prising recovery, and the doctor said he had
passed the crisis, and would soon be well
again. But where was Lucia? Luigi was

wondering what to do, when w T ord came from

LOUIS ESSON.
Maranoa’s Trousers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE four, tlxe four, the little four!”
chanted Hoopiron, monarch of the
Timpoonas, a,s he held aloft the
leather dice-dox and rattled the “bones'*
inside.
“Lend me t’ree tcliillun on these,” said
Maranoa Charlie, the king of the Buttacur-
ras, as he divested himself of a pair of
white Bedford-cord riding-breeches and laid
them at Hoopiron’s side.
Hoopiron counted out three shillings from
the store of silver at his right hand, sat on
the Bedford cords, and went on rattling the
dice-box.
The colored members of the mustering-
camp of Maranoa Creek station looked on
with eyes that stared white in the black
of their faces, while the king of the Tim*
poonas, Hoopiron, enticed from the goddess
of chance the new, white Bedford cords of
King Maranoa. Black Jack, the lamb-
marker, and Titlttenburra Dick each invested
two shillings on the little six, but Maranoa
was content to abide by his first choice and
bet on the seven. “T’ree tchilluns she turns
up the little sebven,” he challenged in a
meaty voice, and flung down his three silver
coins with the air of a duke at Monte Carlo,
On the square of dirty cloth surrounded by
fifteen different shades of black and yellow
squatting figures and lighted by three fat
lamps fell and rolled the three small pink
squares of gelatine. From their seats on the
grass royal persons and the plebeians leaned
forward eagerly to see the fate of the trousers
of the king of the Buttacurras. His monthly
cheque had already gone into the pile that
graced the “table” at the side of the visiting-
king, Hoopiron, and his dog, stockwhip, leg-
gings, money-belt and other valuables had
been distributed amongst the gamblers dur-
ing the past two or three days, as his luck
bad ebbed and left him higher and drier.
“The little four, wattametliinkso!” yelled
Hoopiron as he poised, his clutching hand
■outstretched, to give the gamblers time to
count the black spots that had robbed the
king of the Buttacurras of the royal trousers,
Alas, hazards had cleaned out Maranoa,, even
to liis dignity, so he gathered closer
around him the flapping old wreck of an
overcoat, fastened with strips >i green-
hide. and moved back from the game, nearer
the fire.
There sat his queen, his princess and his
bound. With goanna, baked whole in a coat-
ing of clay in the hot ashes of the g'idya
fire, the women of the royal household fed
him, and with mutton an I damper from
the station store, earned by horsemanship
■and markmansliip and bushci T. Maranoa
•ate what he wanted from theT ■ >d and tossed
the residue backwards to hit queen, who
treated the princess in a simi'ar fashion,
and the princess was as good to the hound.
While they ate they talked:
“I see,” said the princess, “the yelier
feller done all his bull-shootin’ cheque, at
hazards, too. Look liket this Hoopiron might
be a bit of a jolmny-eake spieler, ain’t it?”
“You min’ yer own business, you black
cow,” muttered the king. “Give nunneyer
lip, or I'll put this avoun’ yer logs.” Maranoa
fingered a piece of buggy harness that served
him as belt, though, in view of the very
•obvious bare black legs, it seemed more fash-
ionable than utilitarian.
“An’ don' you get at any o’ yer funny
business with that yelier feller, mind. He
got money to buy a buckboard an’ horses
an’ we goin’ brumby-runnin’ w’en you an’
him get married.”
“Brumby-runniu’!” shrilled the princess,
whose name was Rosie. “Fat lot of brum-
bies you an’ Hoopiron will run. Them clay-
pan mob bin on top o’ you t’ree-four times
an’ you conldn’ get in their dust. If the
yelier feller get after them once on a good
horse there won’ be none o’ them left fer
you an’ old Hoopiron. An’ you get this
camp weddin’ out o’ yer min’, too. I bin
ter see Mr. Johnstone an’ I tol’ him I wanter
church weddin’, with a parson.”
Mention of a church weddin’ drew nothing
but a snort from King Maranoa, but it was
a most expressive snort —as one that might
mean that there -were no church weddings
coming off in his household.
The queen rocked on her hams and held
her peace, for she knew that a whack over
the head with a boomerang or a nulla-nulla
was not far off for the women-folk.
Later, came the yelier feller to pay his
respects and was repulsed with scorn by
Maranoa: “G’way, yer black cow!” grunted
the king, blind to small distinctions of color.
“Wattyor wanter come buzzin’ roun’ here
for? G’way from Rosie, I tell yer. Hoop-
iron got money ter buy red blankets an’ a
buggy and Nebine Harry’s four saddle-horses.
An’ Mr. Johnstone givin’ him a job at the
shearin’. G’way, I tell yer, yer black cow!”
The yelier feller glanced at the plump
Rosie, partly-clad in one of Arhim Kahan’s
print dresses, grinned with a dazzling show
of white teeth and eyeballs, looked respect-
fully at the king, and departed, soft of foot
and tongue, and lithe of body.
His place was taken a few minutes later
by the skinny, grey-haired visiting king,
Hoopiron, of Timpoona, who was greeted
with respectful coldness by Rosie, but with
expansive smiles by Maranoa.
That night Rosie got a “leathering” with
Maranoa’s piece of buggy harness because
she held out for a church wedding, and not
for an informal camp affair according to
the rites and customs of the tribes of a
bygone day.
Maranoa went to bed without regaining
possession of his trousers, for Hoopiron be-
lieved that a bird in the hand is worth two
in the bush.
At daylight next morning the yelier feller,
mounted on a station horse, rode away to-
wards the bore-drain country, he had
been given a job of boundary-riding, for a
week, by Mr. Johnstone. He had tried to
see his princess before he departed, creeping
into the camp ere the first glad chorus of
the birds had commenced, but Maranoa had
heard and thrown a boomerang at him.
Seven days later the yeller feller was sit-
ting loosely in the saddle, riding down the
fence on the Baroo boundary, when he sur-
prised the claypan brumbies on the Five
Mile Creek, watering, because the wind was
blowing strongly in his face and they had
failed to scent him.
With a yell the yeller feller spurred his
horse at the brumbies and dashed in amongst
them. He cut-out the big blue-roan leader
before it had recovered from its surprise,
and, with several cruel strokes front Ilia
heavy stockwhip, headed it for the Tougie
trap-yards. The yeller feller had not a
ghost of a chance of running _ the horse
unassisted, but instinct and training com-
bined to urge him to do all that was humanly
possible.
A hundred yards from the Start the big
blue-roan brumby galloped head .On to ft
gatepost hidden by the dense niiilga scrub
and fell to the ground, stunned, Iloopitort
seemed to fly from the saddle like a, bird
and to alight Oil the .iiindqua'ftefs. df the
prostrate stallion with liis saddle-straps
ready in his hand-.
In thirty Seconds the stallion was bound
with greenliide thongs by the hind and fore
legs alike, and the yeller feller was dancing
a mixture of the Charleston and the war
dance of the Buttacurras around the
to capture which many a man had risked liis
reputation and his life,
That night from the. Gamp by the bore-
drain the yeilel* feller fetched fencing tools
and built him a round yard that encircled
the fallen leader. With bogan hitches of
fencing-wire he twitched it tight and trim.
It 'was an easy week’s work for a horse-
breaker with the experience of the yeller
feller to subdue the blue roan to a state of
approximate docility, with the aid of the
driver of the ration-cart, who arrived on the
morning of the capture for the camp gear.
On the evening that Rosie, secretly encour-
aged by the queen mother, scratched with a
broken bottle the face of the king of the
Buttacurras in the course of her last gallant
stand for a church marriage or none, Mara-
noa, her father, Was still without hik trOusefs,
and he felt that his dignity Ootiln pOt beat
the strain any . lie and Hoopirop
were the only, two remaining male, members of
the Camp, ffnfl tlOopi'roii was showing a strong
disinclination ev'en tp diScuSs tile “loan” of
a pair .of f’rousers, let alone the return of
the Bedford SOlds, till the question of the
royal alliance was definitely settled according
to his ideas. The book-keeper at the station
store had frankly told Maranoa to go to
Ilell when he had suggested a credit account,
and Mr. Johnstone was away from home,
Thus, when the yeller feller slipped into
the camp at moonrise and Ottered certain
sounds into the ear of Maranoa, that auto-
cratic ruler opened out his length like a
carpenter’s rule unfolding and followed the
yeller feller in the direction of the station
store. There was talk with the storekeeper
and the overseer and finally with flip jflart-
ager, Mr. Johnstone, who had jUst fSt hack.
The station bought the bfue-rpan brumby
leader, giving his cpnpiivjrelf in payment the
station hoi’sn On which, he had accomplished
the feUt, that, had ria the station horse-
thile'rs of a dangerous decoy to the camp
horses. Moreover, a reward that had been
standing on offer for three months was cre-
dited to the account of the yeller feller on
the station books, and he was given a
permanent place in the mustering camp.
The musterers had camped that night in
the bend of the Warego, and the yeller feller
lost no time in joining them.
At sunrise the yeller feller was standing
at the tail of the cook’s cart, eating flapjack
and trying to whistle “Get Along, Fima,” at
the same time, when two kings and a queen
and a princess approached, calling for him
with one voice.
“Whatta yer wanter Come buttin’ in on me
an’ Rosie for. yer —- yeller feller?” de-
manded Hoopiron, the visiting king,
The queen, all smiles, was decked out in
the twin sister of the print dress from Ahrim
Kalian that graced the form of her daughter,
Rosie looked in triumph at the yeller feilei*,
who ate on undisturbed.
“Rosie,” announced the queen, loudly and
with unction, “gonner git a church weddin*
on Sundee, at the big house. Mr. Johnstone
sendin’ in the ear fer the parson.”
“I gotta pair red blankets an’ a bangle,”
boasted Rosie.
“Whatta yer wanter come buttin’ in fer, t
tell yer!” angrily repeated Hoopiron. ad-
vancing threateningly towards the yeller
feller.
Then the royal blood of the Buttacurras
asserted itself. Maranoa stretched forth a
lean, muscular arm and violently pushed the
other king back. “G’way, yer dirty ol’ black
cow!” he shouted. “G’way, I tell yer, before
I smack yer one. You otter be dam’ well
ashamed o’ yerself, trvin’ ter marry a young
colored woman like Rosie. G’way an’ ask
the Paroo Queen ter marry yer, if yer mus’
get a missus. None o’ my lubras is gonner
marry a dirty ol’ wallaby like a-you. W’y,
Rosie’s on’y a baby alonga wit’ yer. Get
away before I smack yer one, I tell yer.
Ain’t I told yer before that Rosie gonner be
married in church wit’ a real parson from
Cunnamulla ter the yeller feller? G’way,
yer dirty ol’ black cow!”
In the heat of his denunciation Maranoa
stripped off his tattered overcoat and threw
it ch alien gin gly on the grass. There, ex-
posed to the admiring view of the wide-eyed
colored men in the musterers’ camp, shone
forth a brand-new, spotless and creaseless
pair of Bedford-cord riding-breeches that
creased the shanks of Maranoa Charlie, the
king of the Buttacurras.
Rosie looked lovingly from them to Hoop-
iron, as she d ,j ftly caught a flapjack that
he tossed from his tin plate.
“The yeller feller might be a mug man at
hazards.” he observed, “but he got the ol’
filler* skinned a mile w’en it come ter chasin’
brumbies an’ marryin’ lubras an’ gettin’ a
cheuv'' from Mr. Johnstone, ain’t it?”
“Wbattametbmkso!” assented Rosie, cross-
ing her toes in the grass, and smiling matri-
monially behind her flapjack.

THE MOST EFFICIENT MOWER ON EARTH.
''The
MOTOR MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASON.
The "ATCO” will make q very strong appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c.
It is fitted with a 22-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “Atco,” thanks to the scientific precision of its con-
struction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
With the object of making this ALL-BRITISH MOWER more, popular on
the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
prices. Full stocks on hand.
PRICES:-— -14111. cutters, £47/10/-; 16in., £57/10/-; 18in.,
