LITERARY NOTES.
Buckle and His Critics.
Mr. John M. Robertson’s book on “Buckle
and His Critics ” (Swan, Sonnenscliein and
Co.) is his most memorable work to date.
Though his previous essays in literary and
sociological criticism have been of consider-
able volume and noticeable ingenuity, they
are comparatively light artillery, exploding
with a proportionately insignificant “boom.’
Now, for the first time, Mr. Robertson
canvasses for readers’suffrages on the serious
historical plane.
• * * *
Mr. Robertson’s enthusiasm for Buckle
may be likened to that of those lettered
archaeologists who roam through f%ypt, and
Greece, and Asia Minor, disinterring the
noble statues of antiquity, and clearing away
from many a majestic monument the dust
and dfibris collected to the discredit of care-
less or contemptuous ages. His zeal attacks
all the critics of his Master, great or small,
English or foreign—or as many of them as
one man can possibly attack. He gives them
back scorn for scorn, and rending for railing.
Do they jeer at Buckle’s style ? from their
own style he points their barbs anew : do
they challenge Buckle’s matter ? he confutes
them laboriously, point by point, out of their
own mouths, or one another’s mouths, or by
reference to the original authorities. Such
devotion is not rare in literature, but such
capacity to direct such devotion is not
common.
* * * *
“Confutes” —say rather “attempts to
confute.” Sometimes the honors of the
tussle do not seem as well-secured to Mr.
Robertson as they might be. When critic
has attacked critic, rolled critic over, bitten
critic, taken critic’s bone, and sent critic-
howling into the vista with critic’s tail
between critic’s legs, the performance is n >t
always, in Mr. Robertson’s book, so vivid
and lifelike as to settle the query where Mr.
Robertson’s tail would have been in the other
fellow’s book. Not that Mr. Robertson
denies that there are spots on the sun. He
sees many spots ; but complains that what
Buckle’s critic - have alleged o lie spots are
really not sun-spots at alt. but the dark areas
of their own vision, obscured by ignorance
and prejudice. He too is a critic of Buckle.
The differences between himself and those
whom he attacks are generally expressed in
vitally different conclusions : a great man
with demerits —a small man with merits.
• • • •
Yet Buckle was really great. His histori-
cal torso is magnificent, and it is war—war
on the pedants and dryasdusts, the borrowers
and pigeonholers lost in a maze of details
' and disconnected tags of inferences ; war on
•he recorders of battles and sieges, reigns
a Lid treaties, who pin down epochs like
entomological specimens ; war on the mere
s.y lists and-rhetoricians, on the men of one
age, or one language, or one country, on the
writers who stand an inch away from their
subject, and lose all sense of perspective or
proportion. These have their uses ;in a
minor sense they are historians ; but
they do not write the history which Buckle
aimed to write and began to write. It is not
for what he has done, though that is much,
but for what he suggests that Buckle is so
valuable. Every page is luminous. And
his capacity for generalisation—the highest
intellectual capacity—was almost Newtonian
in force and scope. Where other men
floundered among facts he sprang at once to
the law. Where other men’s minds walked
painfully among events from valley to hill
and down to valley again, he flew above
them as a bird and saw the whole configura-
tion of the landscape. He was the first
historian of note to discard the anthropo-
centric myth, and to write with a sense of
man’s relation to the universe continually
guiding his pen. He hated narrow theo-
logians ; he despised narrow schoolmen ; and
schoolmen and theologians have bitterly
reciprocated his scorn and hate. He
was one ; they were many ; and their
voices and pens have out-cried him.
But what historian of to-day has his mental
equipment 1 who could put his hand to the
plough where Buckle’s dropped it ? Errors
Buckle made, and many—it is given to no
man to receive all knowledge for his pro-
vince ; his theories have been altered in the
progress of science ; yet his book has influ-
enced and continues to influence the spirit
of his age as inuch, perhaps, as any other
book of the century. Buckle was a pioneer
in wide fields of thought, and the very critics
who attack him employ weapons which he
was among the first to point and use.
* * * *
Mr. Robertson’s book was a very necessary
book. It is tedious occasionally , occasion-
ally its comment seems trivial; it almost needs
as much enthusiasm to read it straight
through as was needed to write it; but it
finally clears away many misconceptions,
disposes of many ill-founded attacks, and
takes its place with Mr. Huth’s life on the
permanent shelf of Buckle literature. And
in the assurance of this result, Mr. Robert-
son will find repayment for all his labor.
Henry Oust, W. W, Astor s dismissed Pall
Mall Gazette editor, takes the unusual
course of publishing in the Times the relat-
ing correspondence. The taste of this was
considered doubtful in London journalistic
circles; but a wit closed controversy with

Short, Stories.
The train which five daysa week at 5.25p.m.
leaves Sydney for the Blue Mountains is
known as “the honeymoon train”—so many
newly-wedded couples travel by it. Think
with what a wealth of precious hopes that train
is freighted ! When Driver Cupid touches
the starting lever, how ardently the steam
rushes into the embracing cylinders ! in
what fiery paroxysms the sparks fly from the
heated chimney ! what vistas of poetry and
romance wreathe themselves into the hurry-
ing smoke ! The grimy stoker fires the torch
of Hymen ; the guard, locking with a parental
smile the doors of a dozen engaged compart-
ments, has the air of saying. “Hi , you, my
children ! ” to a family whose potentialities
would stagger the heaviest father of the
melodramatic stage. Then consider ....
(idle rhymesters may enlarge upon the theme
in 24 lines of any metre, divided at pleasure.
The best verses will be printed).
The story of William Gay, whose sonnets
were printed the other day at Bendigo, Vic.,
is a pathetic one. Like the late Francis
Adams, he seems running a race with Time to
get one more book into the light of day be-
fore he is beckoned away to the Shades.
He lies in a private hospital, fed with a
spoon, dictating his verses to a nurse ; and he
has not been out of bed since last October.
His life has been all tragedy. He began if
badly in Glasgow 30 years ago —the odd
child in a family of the severest Scotch type.
As a lad he separated himself from his un-
genial home by winning a bursary at
Glasgow University. Here he lived on next
to nothing ; he was delicate to begin with ;
and the seeds of consumption took root and
flourished. He made his way to London,
always trying to write, and often enduring
semi-starvation. Menaced health drove him
to look to Australia. He undertook to work
his way out on a sailing ship ; fell sick on
board ; and was nursed by friendly pas-
sen ges. Since reaching Melbourne he has
made poor living at journalism—for the
last two years in hospital.
The sadness of Mr. Gay’s circumstances
may be read in the sympathetic criticism
which his sonnets have received ; but, taken
together, they form a strong body of work,
with something pf Wordsworth’s grave sim-
plicity, of Milton’s religious elevation.
Singly, with rare exceptions, they lack
poetry, workmanship, distinction. Mr. Gay
writes easily and not unmelodiously; the
sonnet-form seems to suit him ; but he
has little grace or fervour, and for the most
part he is merely gilding commonplace.
There is so much inaccuracy in the sheet of
eulogies which Mr. Gay issues that it seems
■’necessary to say this, which detracts nothing
from the impression of earnestness, sincerity,
and sober dignity which his Muse leaves
upon the reader.
The essays and reviews of the late C. H.
Pearson, formerly Vic. Minister for Educa-
tion, and author of “ National Life and
Character ” —a very suggestive and valuable
book -are shortly to be published.
In S.M. Herall* of April 4, “L.” brings
a crowd of noted fictional characters to a
conve”sazione. Robert Elsmere talks to
Elsie Venner ; Mr. Potter of Texas to
Princess Napraxine ; and so on. The idea
has been neatly exploited by Landor and
Lang and a score of others ; but “ L.’
crowds all the interest out of her (?) stage,
and her article degenerates to a mere
catalogue.
M‘G. : Uin true = oo; u in cube = yoo;
and yoo , as pronounced, isn’t ee-oo (two
sounds) —it’s simply yoo (one sound). And
even if it were two sounds, then on your
own shoving the u in true (one sound) can-
not possibly have “the same sound” as the
nin cube (alleged two sounds); though the
defective English language gives those differ-
ent sounds the same symbol. Where in
Pitman did you find cube spelt lc-ee-00-b, as
you phonetise it ?
Gordon, dedicating “ Bush Ballads and
Galloping Rhymes” to Whyte Melville, in
lines of which the merit seems rarely to be
recognised, said they came from a land—
Where, tire and fierce drought on her tresses,
Insatiable summer oppresses
Sere woodlands and sad wildernesses
And faint flocks and herds.
Sydney Star, wishing to “quote poetry”
appropriate to R.A. Society’s show, says it
comes at a time when an Australian poet
tells us :
Insatiate autumn oppresses
Sad woodlands and sere wildernesses,
And faint flocks and herds.
Is this ignorance ? or guilt ?
Hood’s “Song of the Shirt” is said to have
tripled the circulation of London Punch.
Litterateur Saintsbury, newly-appointed
Professor of English at Edinburgh Uni-
versity, after speaking of the slovenly
rhymes of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, goes
on to say, “Nay, more, despite her Greek,
she will rhyme ‘idyll’ with ‘middle.’”
Now, Prof. Maccallum, of Sydney Uni-
versity, would defend Mrs. Browning’s (and
his own) pronunciation of this word. Good
dictionaries give both “Idyll and “idyll.'
Probably as many average people pronounce
the word one way as pronounce it the other.
And it is useless pedantry to pit etymology
against custom : how many 20-year-old
words are there in English pronounced
now as when first introduced to the language ?
Further, the slovenly language of Saints-
bury himself is a byword with hostile critics
Kipling’s books, being mostly -nan’s meat
and virile, are not stocked in Melb. Public
Lending Library. Zola is only admitted in
the form of R. H. Sherard s biography.
George Moore’s novels are blacklisted—like-
wise Ouida and A Yellow Aster ; an-
“ The Heavenly Twins ’ weep tears on the
door-mat and are denied.
Fergus Hume’s “Mystery of a Hansom
Cab ” has actually reached' its 377th thou-
sand, and the half-million looms imminent.
This should be a sufficient answer to Marie
Corelli and similar.writers who conceive that
popularity necessarily means merit. It
merely means that, in Lincolnian phrase,
for the people who like this sort of thing
(e.g., ' Sorrows of Satan’) this is plainly
the sort of thing those people like.
W. T. Stead, in the Review ok Reviews,
becomes devil’s advocate for the discredited
Rhodes. He admits, in effect, that the es-
sence of Rhodes’s power is his talent for
corruption, but seems to suggest that s :eh
peccadilloes are a necessary part of ; -v u
men,” who must not be held too closely to
ordinary people’s rule-of-thumb honesty.
Stead would make a very fair Loyola for a,
new order of Nonconformist Jesuits.
Gladstone is writing for the North
American Review a series of articles on
“The Future Life, and the Condition of
Man Therein,” which, in view of their
originality, value, scope, and enlightenment,
might have been penned by a mediaeval
bishop. It is one of the curiosities of modern
science that when a British ex-Premier
founds a scientific theory on a careful induc-
tion of Bible texts the paradox should be
accepted as a commonplace. True, Glad-
stone does not rely wholly on Scriptural
evidence for proof of “man’s future life.’
He refers to the opinions of Barnabas.
Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Hernias, Poly-
carp, and Clement of Alexandria ; and notes
that the attempt to remove Rufinus. Arno
bius, and Athen.igoras from the blofid of
valuable witnesses on liis side is by no means
satisfactory. Any unprejudiced person will
feel glad to have this assurance about
Rufinus. 41

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis (Jure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were uspd and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tain worth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Si SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or

BEFORE YOU
T. E a 3F» !
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to pie id : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise
enough to

A voice front the Lake Height,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
* don’t want no pioneerin’: take me back to
Collin wood,
Where’s the house that holds my heaven, an’ my
heart-strings, an’ my blood !
lake me where the whirring cable-cars slide plea-
sant ways to town,
Where there’s tea that’s tea , and real watered milk
to wash it down !
I arn sittin’ on my reefin’ claim at Day Dawn,
Forrestville,
Watchin’ pet goannas eatin’ flies, an’ gettin’ of
their fill,
Cursin’ that accursed quartz-blow, which I thought
so fine of late,
Cursin’ underlay, an’ shaft, an’ cursin’ quartz an’
cursin’ slate.
This my claim is bought up by the agent, come
from Adelaide :
(Adelaide ! That’s goin’ to Melbourne, where I
learnt my only trade.)
I’ve bin here a blessed twelvemonth, spendin’ grub
an’ sweat an’ fuse
In this hole the Ad’laide agent’s goin’ to win on
or to lose;
Livin’ on tinned dog an’ pudden, an’ preserves of
fruit, an’ such,
Carrots canned, an’ pears in syrup, an’ I hate ’em
overmuch.
Dog and mutton, canned and curried, soon in-
crease the sum of years—
An’ I’Ve got bung eyes, an’ sore lips, an’ Barcoo
rot on my ears.
No more blasted pioneerin—gimme back the job
I ’ad
Makin’ boots in Melbourne fact’ries—I was
strugglin’ then an’ glad !
An’ I got my pay on Fridays—it was just two
quid a week ; '
But my missus ! She can manage—she could
make that two pound speak.
When I left her Friday momin’s for the work I
had to do,
She would say, ‘ ‘ I’ve got a deener—would you like
a carrot stew ? ”
Wouldn’t I just like to hear her say them blessed
words just now :
I’d give half the blessed purchase an’ I’d stay
home, anyhow 1 ,
There’s the kids a-playin’ dollies with a towel and
a stick,
And at night they lisp a prayer for “ dad ” —O
Lord, it makes me sick !
An’ I’m sittin’ here all lonely watchin’ the
goannas’ fun,
And the great salt lakes below me lie a mirage in
the sun.
Lakes for scores of miles and hundreds, salt and
gypsum, fling their sheen
To the rainless sky above them; an’ I crave for
the Yan Yean!
Lurid fires from the condensers where the steam
becomes a tear,
An’ the water’s sold per gallon at the price of
Melbourne beer.
Here the vagrant wind goes moaning ever on
strange tracks at fault,
Sweeping off the seas made by the blue deceitful-
ness of salt;
Gimlet, salmon-gum, and samphire, white-ant-
eaten in the dark—
Oh ! there ain’t a tree in cooee like the gums at
Studley Park.
An’ there’s wide streets East, my oath, yes ! Here
we walk in single file,
And the thirsty land has tragedies to each and
every mile. ,
I don’t want no blasted gnamma-holes—give ine a
Melbourne tap ;
Gimme dust that isn’t greasy; gimme trees that
have some sap;
Gimme tracks where there’s no Afghans an’ no
roarin’ camel cow —
Gimme tracks down to Fremantle an’ I’ll get home
anyhow.
We ain’t got no reefs in Melbourne, but we’ve got
cheap meat and fruit,
Not gold-weighted curried mutton, carried here
per blasted boot;
You can earn and earn like thunder, but the old
stone-broker comes
When you’ve anted five-and-sixpence for a bottle
full of plums. .
You’ve to travel as a swamper, if you am t a
wealthy jay;
For horses drink ten shillings and eat thirty bob
a day.
Come on, Mr. Ad’laide gent.! pay up the balance;
meet the claim ; . .
I am goin’ back to Melbourne, for this isn t worth
the game.
Gimme back my homely heaven in that stinkin’
Melbourne street;
Make me stone-broke near the people who have
poverty made sweet;
I will leave these lakes for ever, never hear a camel
roar,
Never hear the Afghan “ Hooshta ! hauling nose-
pegs at the bore ;
Never work the crazy windlass, never, never,
never more , . . .
Gaze on seas-of salt and lophet which have never
any shore ; , , , ,
Never kid the English Johnny, when lie calls to
see the claim, , . T . „
Tell him ironstone is gold, until bai Jove .
grows mighty tame.
I will sit in some small cottage, with my wife and
children by, ,
And we’ll sit and love for ever till the time shah
come to die; , , , ,
No more shall I have my camp-place fenced by
mountain-range and sky,
No more hear the lake-wind wailing die down in
the samphire sigh ,
No more shall the tinned-meat feed me ; I shall
have a steak that’s good ; _ ...
I don’t want no pioneerin—I am off to Coiling-
wood !
Randolph Bedford.

SATURDAY, APRIL 18, 1890.
The Insurance Difficulty.
The old question about the advisability or
otherwise of extending the operations of the
A.M.P. Society to England and other coun-
tries outside Australasia is again cropping
up. The A.M.P. Society is a national insti-
tution ; it is the largest life office, save one,
belonging to the British empire ; and the
proposal to extend its business abroad has
excited a lot of interest on several previous
occasions. The final result of the controversy
is hardly a matter of doubt; sooner or later, if
present conditions continue, the A.M.P., and
other societies as well, will have to spread
their operations over Great Britain, and pro-
bably many other places, in their own
defence. Australia as a field for life-insur-
ance business has decayed very much of late
years, through excessive competition, reduc-
tion in rates of interest, depreciation in the
value of securities, lack of prosperity among
the people, diminution in the rate of increase
of population, lack of safe investments for
the enormous accumulation of insurance
funds ; and various other influences. Some of
these troubles arise from natural causes, and
more of them from the deranged policy of
the various Governments. And the result
of them all is that the boom days of large
bonuses and constantly-increasing business
have departed—for the time, at all events.
* * *
There are at present ten local offices doing
life business in Australasia, to say nothing
of three old proprietary institutions which
have practically retired from the field. There
are also one English and three American
offices at work, making fourteen in all. This
means that there are nearly twice as many
offices in proportion to population as in the
United Kingdom, and that there is a great
deal more insurance-office than the popula-
tion can reasonably support. As the popu-
lation increases, it is probable that other
English and American offices will swarm into
the country ; in the absence of any re-
strictive legislation, the possibilities in this
direction are absolutely unlimited. This
excessive competition means that there are far
more different-sots.of"head.offices,and branch
offices to be supported than there need be,
also more different managers, directors,
actuaries, office staffs, sets of agents and
other appurtenances to be maintained than
the business actually requires-, and all these
needless extra charges have to be paid by the
policy-holder in some shape or other.
Further, when 14 different lots of agents are
hunting after the available business of a
small population, which seven of them could
do to the satisfaction of everybody con-
cerned, it means that business is harder to
get, and the agent has to be paid on a larger
scale for getting it to enable him to live on
the game, and this extra expense has also to
be charged to the policy-holder, as the in-
dividual who pays everything in the end.
The natural result of all this pressure is that
expense rates are far higher than they need
be, therefore the societies have either to
charge higher rates or pay smaller bonuses
than would otherwise be necessary, and
either way the insurer suffers.
♦ * * *
If the invasion by British and American
offices and the multiplication of local ones
are allowed to continue, the time will ulti-
mately arrive when the Australian societies
will have to skirmish for business in Britain
and America to make up for what they lose
in their own country. One—-the Colonial
Mutual--has already spread itself over the
United Kingdom and South Africa, and has
done remarkably well by it, but if all the
Australian societies did likewise they would
intensify the competition to such an extent
that there would probably be very little
profit in it—for some of them, at all events.
The shortest and most effective remedy for
the trouble is for the Australian Govern-
ments to license the various offices now doing
business in this country; to prohibit any
office doing business here without a license ;
and to enact that no more licenses shall be
granted—except to a State insurance office —
until the population of Australia and Tas-
mania has reached, say, 6,000,000. After
that figure is attained one new society might
be licensed for each additional million or
more of population. This scheme (which is
altogether apart from any question of State
audit or State supervision in any shape) would
inflict no injury upon any one who has
any serious right to be considered. The
people who start a new insurance society
under present conditions certainly do not do
it to fill a public want, for all the public want
which exists in this direction is already filled
to overflowing ; therefore the assumption is
that they do it solely to supply comfortable
billets for themselves at the expense of the
public, who are already supporting more
managers and directors than are at all neces-
sary. Therefore, this paper declines to re-
gard these—the only possible sufferers—as
persons who deserve any consideration what-
ever.
* * * *
As regards the public, the license system,
on the lines suggested, should be wholly
beneficial. There is sufficient rivalry among
the fourteen live offices at present doing busi-
ness in the country to prevent serious risk
of their becoming fossilised. By the gradual
reduction in the intensity of the competition,
which must follow as population increases, it
would be possible to conduct the business at
much less expense than at present, and this
would mean much more profit for the in-
surers. It would diminish the tendency, which
is beginning to appear in certain. quarters,
to attract business by cutting rates danger-
ously low, and by holding out estimates of
impossible profits in the future ; in other
words, it would reduce the possibilities of
dishonesty by making it possible for all the
existing institutions to live on an honest
basis. And it would enable them to live
honestly on local business alone, whereas,
as things are, it seems increasingly probable
that they will have to spread out into distant
lands to make up for the difficulties incurred
through excessive competition at home. As
a proof that the competition is excessive :
Among the six large life offices doing busi-
ness in Australia, one—a sound and highly-
reputable concern showed a continuous
decline in its premium income every year
from 1886 to 1893—the last year to which
the tabulated statement refers ; another
showed a decline in ’92 and ’93; another
showed a falling-off in ’9O, ’92 and ’93;
a fourth also showed a declining pre-
mium income for three years ; and the re-
maining two showed a considerable drop
for one year, at all events. Moreover,
though the expense rate ought to diminish
as business grows larger, it was actually more
per cent, in 1892 than it was in 1881, though
business had more than doubled. Under
these conditions there is good reason for the
State to shut down on any further aggrava-
tion of the evil. Life assurance is a business
of national importance—not a thing to be
left to the go-as-you-please methods of free
competition.
* * * *
The chief reason why the Australian
societies have shown such excellent results
in the past, despite the high expense rate
caused by too much assurance society in pro-
portion to population, is the remarkably high
rate of interest realised on their invested
funds. But while the competition shows no
signs of diminution, unless the State inter-
feres in some decisive fashion, and conse-
quently the expense rate declines very slowly,
the interest realised has been diminishing
rather rapidly, and seems likely to fall a good
deal lower and thereafter to remain down
permanently. The Australian societies have
been confined by the circumstances of the
country to three principal modes of invest-
ment —freehold property, loans on mortgages,
and loans on the security of their own poli-
cies. Freehold property pays a much smaller
percentage than it did, and through the
steady increase of taxation and other ciicuni-
stances it seems likely to remain that way ,
moreover, by reason of the practical cessa-
tion of the great borrowed-money boom, the
selling-value shows a decided tendency to
fall instead of constantly rising as in the old
financial-drunk days. The interest on mort-
gages has fallen, partly through general stag-
nation, partly through the influx of foreign
money from the glutted markets of Eng ant,
partly through general distrust, partly through
increased competition of banks and builc -
ing societies and mortgage companies, partly
because the insurance societies themselves
have now £*22,000,000 to invest whereas,
fifteen years ago, they had only £4,000,000.
And it seems likely to fall further and still
more violently through a continuation of all
these causes, and also through the spread of
the State Land Bank system, which is now
only in its infancy, and may yet expand in-
definitely, and which is expressly designed
to reduce the rate of mortgage-interest.
The third great resource —loans on the sur-
render values of policies—has hitherto been
a most profitable investment, and one which
the societies had practically all to themselves;
but these securities are so liquid and so re-
liable that, sooner or later, other financial
institutions will begin to compete in this
branch of investment at a low rate of inter-
est, and badly damage this resource also.
Owing to the insane and unpatriotic policy
of selling almost all Government and good
municipal debentures in London, there is
practically nothing else in which the local
societies can invest their money on anything
like a large scale. Therefore, they are con-
fronted with the practical certainty that the
large profits hitherto realised upon their
accumulated funds are, to some extent, a
thing of the past, and, unless the loss can be
made up in the future by a large reduction
in working expenses, bonuses will never
again be paid on the magnificent scale of
former years. The only way in which, so
far as appears at present, working expenses
can be reduced is by a diminution of the pre-
sent excessive competition, and no effectual
method of doing that has yet been suggested.
Therefore The Bulletin proposes that the
State should closely restrict the number of
societies in proportion to population, and this,
it believes, is the only remedy that has the
.slightest prospect of meeting the case. This
proposal has nothing whatever to do with the
necessity for a State insurance office or for a
State audit of private offices; the adoption of
both these reforms would not diminish in
any way the need for the proposed restric-
tion. The said restriction is practically an
adaptation, in a milder form, of the Scotch
banking law, which practically prohibits the
creation of new banks in that country; there-
fore those conservative individuals who desire
at all times to act strictly on British prece-
dent have here a good example to follow.
The South Australian Referendum
The obligatory referendum, involving the
decision of a public question by vote of the
whole body of electors, is not yet included by
Parliamentary enactment among the means of
government of any Australasian province.
Nothing, however, prevents the application of
the referendum principle at any time towards
the settlement of any public matter in dispute ;
and the South Australian Government proposes
to employ it at the general election on April
25. The questions set the electors are :
1. Do you favor the continuance of the present system
of education in the State schools ?
. 2. Do you favor the introduction of religious instruction
in the State schools during school hours?
3. Do you favor the payment of the capitation grant to
denominational schools ?
The local R.C. Archbishop is reported to have
advised his flock to answer “No” to the first
two questions, and “ Yes ” to the third. (The
R.C. church wants the whole hog or none)
I’lie local Anglican Bishop is said to recommend
“ No ” t 0 the first question, and “ Yes ” to the
second and third. (The Anglican church would
prefer the whole animal, but will take half if
it can get no more). The Presbyterian Assembly
considers that the first question should be left
unanswered, the second answered “ Yes ” and
the third answered “No.” (The Presbyterians
don t care for pork all the time, but will take
a little bit if they’re allowed to choose their
own pet morsels.) The Bulletin advises in-
telligent men and women to answer “ Yes ” to
the first question, and “ No ” to the second and
1 iii / 1 , HE Bulleti * thinks the sectarian hog
should be kept penned in the sectarian sty.)
Most Austrahans have convinced themselves
that State aid to religion, in any form, is a
thoroughly undesirable thing. There are
always, however, a number of waverers, and
a number of people whose opinions are in pro-
cess of formation, and for the sake of these it
seems expedient to range anew some of the
reasons which have influenced this conviction
It may be premised that the result of the
coming vote will not directly affect the South
Australian educational system. That system
permits the ministers of any recognised
ft" * 0 , gl ! e religious instruction In
the State schools, out of school hours to
children whose parents desire it. The com
promise is one employed in other Austrian
provinces, and is found practically harmles"

<Wto,l that the advocate' oTltaTafd™ate
already, „ show,,, divided into hiSseaio^
and their answers to the second and third
questions are bound to be inconclusive and
contradictory.
» * * •
Nevertheless, the first question should put
every democratic voter on his or her mettle.
The first argument that suggests itself against
State aid to religion in Australia is that every
Australian province has tried the system and
found it injurious. In province after province
the subsidy to religious schools has been with-
drawn, and a system of practically secular
State education substituted. In Westralia
religious bigotry found its last retreat, yet even
Westralia has now withdrawn State aid from
denominational schools. Why? Did these con-
sistent changes from a religious to a secular
system follow' one upon the other without grave
reason ? Is it wise to recur in Australia to a
system that has already in Australia been tried
everywhere, and over and over, and has always
and every where been found wanting?
* * * *
Universal history suggests the answer.
Alliance between Church and State has in
every country, in all ages, proved injurious
to the State. Italy, the scene of a great
temporal sovereignty acquired by the head of a
Christian religion, at last purchased its
release from that sovereignty with the blood of
some of its best patriots, and Austria and the
Papacy fought together to destroy the liberties
of the nascent nation. To this day, so bitter
was the experience of priestcraft gained in the
years preceding 1861, the name of priest is for
educated Italy a symbol of contempt. Yet the
Papacy has never ceased endeavoring to extend
its temporal supremacy ; it would dearly love to
win in Australia an influence to replace that
which it has lost in Europe. The object of
the Catholic Church is its own ascendancy:
its chief means is the enslavement of
the human mind. Hence its zeal in all
countries to undertake the entire education of
youth, and implant a devotion to its interests,
a subservience to its instructions, which can
never be eradicated. Hence its horror of the
Australian State schools, which teach facts and
truths regardless of their bearing on religious
dogma ; hence its continual segregation of the
children of its own flock from the dangerous
influences of free speech, and free thought, and
free light. It is the Catholic Church that keeps
alive denominational education in Australia:
the efforts of the Protestant sects are meagre
and half-hearted by comparison.
» * * *
It is unwise for South Australia to help the
Catholic Church, or any other church, to sow
the seeds of disunion among its citizens. When
the State encourages a system which sets apart
the Catholic boy from the Anglican boy, and
the Presbyterian girl from the girl wdio goes to
the State school, it does itself a grievous wrong.
The only school recognised by the State should
be a National school—a school where children
of all creeds, of all social conditions, can meet
on the same plane, and learn that the State
exacts from them all the same social duty, and
grants to them all the same social privileges.
In this country, at this day, much of the bitter-
ness of old religious feuds has been forgotten.
Why fan them into new flame ?
* * * . *
It is not the business of the State to teach
any variety of religion. The general principles
of social morality are not the property of any
religious body, and are not contained in anyone
religious text-book. They are the crystallised
fruit of uncounted ages of human experience,
and have been expressed and symbolised in a
thousand ways by a thousand philosophers.
They may be taught apart from any hook, or
faith, or fetish. Regarding the comparative
value of books, and faiths, and fetishes, there
are many differences of opinion, and upon
these differences are founded many dogmas.
It is unjust for the State to promulgate at
the expense of the general body of tax-
payers the religious dogma of any section of
the taxpayers. It is inexpedient: the State
should not subsidise instruction concerning
matters which it knows nothing about. Hell is
not a Govt, department.
* * * *
And, if it be urged that not subsidy of
denominational schools, but Biblical instruc-
tion in State schools, is what is wanted, these
considerations lose nothing of their force. Bibli-
cal instruction will not satisfy the chief agitators
against the present system : the Catholic
church will still remain outside. The State is
a Union of citizens of all creeds to secure good
government on earth ; it has no business to tax
un-Christian citizens in order to teach the
children of Christian citizens how affairs are
managed in Heaven. And, if the truth must
be told, the Bible is behind the morality of the
age : it was full time the Chicago churches
bowdlerised it. Every decent church or family
has bowdlerised it long ago. All the purity of
its selected maxims cannot nullify the force of
the sanction which it gives to depraved conduct.
In its totality, as a moral work, the Bible is
riot fit to be read to children.
* * * *
For all these reasons the S.A. democrat is
enjoined to record his (or her) vote on April *25
against any change in the present educational
system. It is vitally necessary that he record
his vote, lest judgment should go by his default.
And, if he cannot defend the boon of unsee-
tarian State education, he is not worthy to
enjoy it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Kingston’s “Continuous Parliament.”
Ihe programme announced by Premier King-
ston, of S.A., consists of several great demo-
cratic principles and one unaccountable fad.
He proposes, among other things, to introduce
the principle of elective Ministries in lieu of the
old, discredited policy of Government by Con-
tradiction, to establish the Referendum, to
further reduce the franchise of the Upper
House, and to do various other things in which
every true Democrat will back him up to the
u termost. And,.in addition to these reforms,
ie proposes to put S.A. Assembly on an entirely
new basis. Instead of a complete dissolution
every three years and the election of a new


JhnnM P r °P° ses one-half the Assembly
should retire every second year, so that instead
ot a whole election every three years there will
be two half ones in four years. The only
reason advanced in favor of this scheme is that
it will provide a “Continuous Parliamentin
other words, if any great crisis should arise be
tween the dissolution of one-half the Assembly
and its re-election, the other half may rise to the
occasion so far as half an object can rise to
any occasion—and declare war, or float a big
loan, or mobilise the troops, or do whatever is
necessary. This is presumably what Kingston
\ T -?c IlS i’ m faCfc ’ lf lle doesu ’ L mean that, it is
difficult to see where the advantage comes in.
Uu the other side there are sundry serious dis-
advantages. The Assembly will never wholly
reflect the popular sentiment. At the best,
one-half of it will represent how the people
feel, and the other half will represent how they
felt two years ago. At the worst, one-half will
represent how they felt a year and 11 months
ago, and the other half will represent how they
felt three years and 11 months ago, and there
will never be any real accord. If there is a
great revulsion of popular sentiment, such as
that which swept away M'Culloch in Victoria
years ago, only half of it can find expression.
1 here may be in power an almost wholly Tory
or almost wholly Democratic legislature, and
when the customary change of sentiment comes
along the people may want to replace it by
one of an almost entirely different com-
plexion, and simply because they can’t do
so their interest in politics will largely evapo-
rate. A vast amount of the interest in the
Assembly election is based on the fact that it is
a fight for absolute possession of the dominant
House, and the winners “get there” for cer-
tain ; a fight in which the winners may not get
there after all, but may simply, as the result of
a great triumph, reduce the other party’s
majority somewhat and leave it still in posses-
sion, is a very different affair. At present, if
any great crisis arises between the dissolution
and the election, the Ministry acts on its own
responsibility and at its own risk, and this plan
looks about as satisfactory as the proposed
system of intermediate Government by half a
Pirliament. A much more effective plan than
either would be to keep the old Assembly in
existence until the new one was elected, and
• hen there would be a whole House to fall back
upon at an emergency instead of a mere dis-
located fragment. Kingston’s plan looks like
that of a man who feels that he must keep on
doing things to preserve his reputation as a
progressive politician, and who doesn’t know
exactly in what direction to progress, so finds
it necessary to do something comparatively
harmless to fill in time while he looks round for
a new impulse.
A Matter of Economy.
The following item from Premier Kingston’s
>S.A. election programme is interesting princi-
pally because it, or something to the same
etfect, has been an item in the election pro-
gramme of every prominent Australian politician
so far back as The Bulletin can remember,
and this paper would have felt lonesome with-
out it:—
He promised economy in the finances, and claimed that
since the Kingston Government took office the cost of
administration had been reduced by £120,000 annually.
He hoped to avoid the necessity of fresh taxation, and
undertook, if the finances warranted it, to raise the
exemption from income-tax to £l5O.
What this paper has long been waiting tor, and
is still waiting for, is the advent of some straight
and outspoken politician who will tell this
country the truth in financial matters. Said
truth is that Australia, as a whole, is much
more lightly taxed than it has any reason to
expect, and much more lightly than it ought
to be if it is going to meet its liabilities
honestly, and having stated these facts that
politician will add that he is going to increase
taxation forthwith. Among the Australian
provinces, at least three—New South Wales,
Victoria and South Australia are already
m >re lightly taxed than Great Britain, and
all the seven provinces, except Westralia, are
m >re lightly taxed than many countries of Con-
tinental Europe, where the people are much
less able to bear the burden. But for a long
series of years Australia’s rule-of-thumb finan-
ciers have educated the people to believe, first,
that they are an oppressed, heavily-taxed,
ground-down community (which they are not) ;
second, that they should live in a constant state
of maudlin sympathy with themselves over
their own alleged burdens (which is quite un-
called for) ; and, third, that the first duty of
every Treasurer is to reduce taxation and cheer-
fully dash the consequences. Therefore, the
normal state of things is that in good years,
when there ought to be a large surplus to aid
the public works expenditure, taxation is cut
down and expenditure kept dangerously close
to revenue. In bad years there is a big deficit,
which is passed on, or funded, or held over,
because the Government lacks the courage to
impose new taxation and cover the shortage.
And at all times there is a tendency to shove
every item of public works expenditure —
reproductive, partially reproductive, or wholly
unproductive, expenditure for repairing old
bridges and dredges, cleaning out rivers which
perpetually silt up again, making roads, repair-
ing roads, building gaols, lunatic asylums,
benevolent ditto, court-houses, schools, fences,
wharves, and offices, repairing, altering, and
patching ditto, wood-blocking streets, and the
like—into loan expenditure, and to leave the
bill to posterity, merely that the Treasurer
may boast that he took off the threepenny duty
on tea, or did something equally obscure, which
was no visible benefit to anybody, and which
no one would have noticed if the fact wasn t
kept perpetually bifore him. lhis paper is
waiting p-tientiy for the right kind of Trea-
surer to come along—the one who will raise
£.303,000 a \eir by extra taxation (which
hardly anyone would notice after the first year)
and spend it in building new railways, and
1 mking rivers, and constructing roads and
i ritraiion works, and thereby “absorb surplus
labor,” and “ develope the resources of the
country,” and “open up the inteiior,” and
“ promote the circulation of capital,” and do
all the other beautiful things which our great,
tired country is always hearing about. In
siiu. t, it wants a man who will realise that you
can’t make omelettes without breaking eggs,

The Matter that “ Transpired Outside.”
Bo^]^fI IP J mT V f 0 , Ul ' d gnilty the l ohmer
hoard of taking bribes m his capacity as a J.P.,
sent in his resignation as a member of Melb.
tiospita Committee immediately after his
downfall. Baxter, also a member of the com-
niittee, and also found guilty, made no sign,
and another member suggested that the resig-
natmn of this awful person should be asked for
it tie hadn t sufficient grace to voluntarily send it
a ong. \\ hereupon a further member rose indig-
nantly to protest that the committee “had no
right to take notice of what transpired outside”
—in other words, that the committee should
allow Baxter to remain, and should profess to
e officially ignorant of his corrupt doings
because they weren’t done in the committee-
room while the committee was sitting. Accord-
ing to this species of logic, when one Fat Man
commits a disgraceful offence and it is proved
against him, every other Fat Man is
to hold that he never did anything, and
that no one ever heard of him doing any-
thing, becahse it “ transpired outside.” If
Baxter had been a union shearer proved to
have burned a woolshed during a strike, The
Bulletin wonders if that committeeman would
still associate with him because his offence tran-
spired outside. Also, it wonders if Mr. Nichol-
son and people l.ke him regard, say, Judas
Iscariot as a respectable gentleman whom
nobody could object to associate With ? The
small difficulty which has been thrown up so
persistently against that deceased capitalist
also transpired outside. So did every other
offence in the world’s histor}', for that matter;
so, according to that hospital person’s
mode of reasoning, it appears that he would
be perfectly willing to have Deeming as a
fellow-member if he were still alive ; likewise
Oscar W ilde, and the union shearers in gaol
at St. Helena, and George Dean, and the
person who was lately flogged for indecent
assault, and the hangman, and the gaol-flogger,
and six or eight burglars, pickpockets, welshers,
and the like. Everything that could be alleged
against any or all of them transpired outside.
The Parsimony of Economics.
Blessed is the fanatic who puts his trust
in an O’M that is beyond the borders
of Proof-and-Disproof whose saving faith
in misunderstandings of the unknown will
carry him serenely on, heedless of scoffs and
sneers. Be his fetish Karma, or Kismet, or
Apostolic Succession, or the Bunyip, or the
newly-invented Boobong—his faith may survive
as faiths survived in the days when the world
was wide. But what is the fate of the fanatic
who pawns his soul to the Manchester School—
who takes Supply for his God, and Demand for
his Devil, and Competition for his Hades—and
who has constantly to forswear his faith to
serve his fetish ? Such a man finds himself
doubting his faith, but without faith in his
doubts. Such a man might find himself con-
templating any portion of the social system—
the educational, for instance—forgetful entirely
of his allegiance to Supply, Demand, and Com-
petitidn. Giving his attention to Melbourne,
he might make the followfing remarks :
At present there is nothing to prevent persons of the
most superficial attainments from opening a “grammar
school” or “ institute” and employing such cheap assist-
ance as best suits their commercial instincts or the length
of their purses. The abundance of such establishments
does not result in supplying the public with a fair article
at the reduced price which conies of competition. It
merely supplies an inferior or positively bad article, which
enters into competition with genuine education, diverts
pupils from the better schools, and thereby cripples the
resources of the latter to such an extent that it becomes
impossible for them to maintain the necessary staff of
really efficient teachers.
This recantation of the eternal verities of
economics is found in the Argus leading-article
of Feb. 22. It is a complete refutation of the
principles to which that journal is pledged—
the freedom of trade and the fundamental
righteousness of competition. Speaking after a
practical enquiry into something that it under-
stands, the Argus declares that unrestricted
competition is a bane and not a blessing. That
saying of John Bright’s, that Adulteration is a
formofeompetitionand oughtnot to beinterfered
with, is now rejected by all but the most fana-
tical of the Manchester school. John Bright
would have been nearer the truth had he said
that competition is a form of adulteration.
Competition implies the survival of the un-
fittest motives, and it necessitates the un-
natural selection of opportunities. Of all faiths
orthodox economics is the one most niggardly
in consolation to its followers—it cramps the
hope and dwarfs the mercy of man. It is sig-
nificant of the parsimony of economics that
the best of its works is a Torv.
Sydney Telegraph in defence of “ private en-
terprise ” :
The State is such a bad business manager that . . it
has no chance against private enterprise. In order to
make our railways yield the best service to the public, it
was found necessary to turn them into a quasi-private
concern by putting them under the control of an inde-
pendent commission, and even in the red-tape manage-
ment of the departmental offices the same system has now
been adopted.
This looks very large and convincing, no doubt ;
but see how it reads the other way up :
Private enterprise is such a bad business manager, &c.
In order to make our insurance societies, &c., yield the
best returns to the shareholders it is found necessary to
take the management out of the hands of the private
owners and entrust it to an elective Government in the
shape of a board of directors. Even in the red-tape
management of the office the private owners have found
it essential to take the business out of their own hands
and entrust the selection of their managers and offlt ers
to a practically irresponsible Government of their own
creation. Also, in the most progressive countries it has
been found necessary to make them, to some extent,
public concerns by State audit, or by insisting on the
publication of accounts, or by compelling them to furnish
returns to the Government or by other means.
It is a poor slab of logic which won't bear being
1 ioked at on both sides.
Any institution of a stipendiary magistrate
system would be ineffective and harmlu! unless
strict provision were made that the said magis-
trates should not be at the beck and call <>f the
Crown law authorities. It is said that in times
of retrenchment these people send out circulars
to the magistrates to the effect that proper costs
should be given to the Crown, &c. The
honorary magistrates can afford to, and often
do, treat these circulars with contempt,
but, as at present constituted, the stipen-
diary magistracy cannot afford to. Would
it not be possible to give them a security of
tenure somewhat similar to the judges, and yet
render it an easier matter for Parliament to
censure or remove them in case of necessity ?
Ihe awe inspired by the Crown Prosecutor in
the average stipendiary is also to be thought of.
Again, the inclination of the stipendiary to
favor the side represented by a lawyer requires
to be taken into consideration. Perhaps, if we
are to have election as the remedy for the
scandals of the honorary magistracy, the election
of stipendiaries (candidates being restricted to
men of ascertained qualification) would also be
a useful innovation.
Whenever a Melb. Metropolitan Board con-
tractor is caught evading the minimum-wage
clause he pleads that the underpaid unfortunate
is not engaged as a workman at all but as a
‘‘ nipper and, as the “nippers’” duties in-
clude everything from running messages to
swinging picks, there is hardly any gainsaying
the statement. The blame, however, rests witli
the Board and its officials in accepting such
pleas; Ihe conditions of contract distinctly
state that no laborers are to be paid less than
6s. a day, certain penalties being provided for
infraction ; and if full-grown able-bodied men
of 20 years ana upwards don’t come under the
heading, what are laborers? The conditions
don’t recognise any such class as nippers, and
neither would the Board if it were in earnest in
its professions of humanity and not a whited
sepulchre of hypocrisy.
1 his time last year, after the outbreak of public
feeling about the 4s. lld.-a-day rate, Melb.
City Council accepted a tender for the supply
of man, horse, and dray at ss. Sd. This tender
has now expired, and at last Council meeting
it was decided not to call for fresh tenders, but
to extend the present contract at Bs. a day,
which Councillor Pigdon remarked was “a
very fair price in view of the present price of
feed, &c.”—“ etcetera ” probably including
men, horses, and wear and tear on drays.
Wear and tear on men, of course, doesn’t
count. It will thus be seen that the Council’s
conscience has smitten it to the extent of 2s. 4d.
per day—rather a big smite as things go—and it
may reasonably be expected that when the
report of the select committee, now inquiring
into the wages question, is published, the
Council will approve of the insertion of some,
if not a very large, minimum wage in the next
conditions three months hence. It moves—
even the hog-like Melb. City Council moves.
Gov. Brassey, at Bendigo, speaking his little,
harmless, necessary piece :
I am glad to learn from the lips of the Mayor that there
is no party—not even the most insignificant in Victoria—
which demands separation from the old country. If there
were such a party, it would be my duty as Governor to
frustrate its knavish pranks.
Whilst H.E. looks to mayors and “ sich ” for
proofs of the existence of an Australian national
party, he can rely upon enjoying his comfort-
able ignorance ; but as to frustrating the aims
of the nationalists, no Governor can do aught
but help on their cause. Tor Governors are
necessarily frothy and flatulent persons, who
feel themselves called upon to bleat with sheep-
like pertinacity dreadful platitudes about ’Ome,
and the Empire, and the gracious Queen, which
are supposed to satisfy the loyal cravings of the
great Australian heart, but which really sicken
men of horse-sense. Attitudinising and plati-
tudinising Governors are largely responsible for
“ that tired feeling” in Australia.
Some really fine distortions of fact came up at
the banquet recently tendered to Premier Reid
at Casino (N.S. W.). “We have tried Protec-
tion and Protectionist Ministries,” said the
chairman of the function, “and found them
both wanting. We now have a Freetrade
Ministry, and if we give it a fair show you
will see in a few years how much better a
state of things will exist than in the past.”
Then Premier Reid arose and asked for “ a fair
trial for the new' fiscal policy, and if, in a few
years, it retarded progress instead of encourag-
ing it, he would be the first to acknowdedge his
mistake.” And no one had the courage, amonsr
all the prevailing slobber, to point out that they
had been trying Reid’s revenue-tariffism for 40
years, and if it hadn’t proved its alleged good
qualities by this time ituiever would. Also, no
one mentioned to the unreliable chairman that
N.S. W. never tried “Protection and Protection-
ist Ministries.” It tried 26 successive Foreign-
trade Cabinets, and then it gave one Protectionist
Ministry a trial for three years, and, because it
couldn’t do in three years what the others had
failed to do in thirty-five, it was thrown out.
The spectacle of the 27th Foreign-trade Ministry
asking for a “ fair trial,” as if its creed hadn’t
been tried and found wanting 26 times already,
is very good. How is revenue-tariffism to pro-
duce “ so much better a state of things than in
the past ” seeing that the past in New South
Wales was practically all the same system?
And why didn’t it create a blessed state of
things while it was there instead of only
intending to do it now ?
A Counterfeit Causerie.
Dear Bulletin, —Many months ago you drew
attention to the fact that an indisputable danger
of the drop in silver to many existing currencies
is the premium now offering to counterfeiters.
Since then, counterfeit silver coins have been
found in four Australian provinces.
* * * *
The first parcel was primarily detected by the
circumstance that it was deposited in bulk with a
Melbourne bank. The Chinese merchant who
made the deposit was undoubtedly ignorant of the
nature of the transaction he was engaged in ; he
received the parcel (,£55 of shillings, all spurious,
except three) from Hongkong, per steamer. If he
had been in the know, and willing to act, he could
have passed off these counterfeits in the ordinary
course of business, without any danger what-
ever. They were not by any means well-struck,
nor were they from good dies, but they
were quite good enough to deceive any
non-expert member of the public. These
counterfeits were of the pre-jubilee design, but
bore dates exclusively used on the jubilee design.
I he lettering was imperfect and somewhat clumsy.
he ettigy of the Queen was a bad copy of the
official effigy. They were made of silver, not
quite up to standard, of a quality usual in Mexican
dollars, and contained a trace of gold. Neverthe-
less, the coins would have passed unquestioned in
ordinary trade, When they were officially
examined the defects were duly catalogued and
announced m the press. Soon afterwards the now
suspicious eyes of the local bankers found some
more coins of a doubtful nature. These proved to
have much fewer defects, the dates were adjusted,
the dies had been more carefully engraved, the
struck in a more workmanlike manner,
and the quality of the silver was nearer the proper
degree of fineness. The counterfeiter (presumably
located m Hongkong or China) was willing
to learn and to profit by his lessons. Next dis-
coveries were made in Tasmania. The Tas-
manian counterfeits were very good work, and
lead to the suspicion that many more remain
m the torpid circulation of that sequestered spot,
oouth Australia, unwilling to be peculiar, sought
out some “ bad ” shillings in its borders ; and then
Kanakaland, last of all, made the discovery that
an Australian province can have more than one
curse, these later counterfeits are the work of
smart men, and are almost as good as if turned out
by the official Mint.
* * * •
The caution of the counterfeiters engaged in
tin s interesting traffic is most exemplary. They
made one mistake—their attempt in Melbourne,
that mistake was engaging a man “not in the
know. Tasmania, South Australia, and Kanaka
land have not discovered large quantities of the
frauds, Ihe “bobs’’came not in battalions but
in single spies. Furthermore, it is always “bobs”
and not sixpences or “half dollars.” They are
practising with the “ bobs ” as far as Australia
(and perhaps England) may be Concerned. When
they have attained the proficiency to be derived
from official criticism, they will extend their opera-
tions to other sections of the currency. With
silver at 31 pence there is only 5'6 pence worth of
silver in a shilling—allowing a good margin of
profit.
* * * *
The Straits Settlements have also had the favor of
attention, and one of the current coins (rix-dollar)
has received the sincerest form of flattery. Some
police proceedings took place at Singapore, but
the offence w T as not sheeted home to anyone in
particular.
* » * *
It is a mathematical certainty that a flourishing
trade in counterfeit silver will ultimately be estab-
lished in one or more dark corners of the earth if
silver remain below 40 pence per ounce, which is
very likely.
'« * * *
At present Australia is not concerned in the
trouble nationally. If the unauthorised coins get
111 to circulation and remain undetected, the only
present difference will be that Australia will be
buying its currency from China instead of from
England. But it is a disagreeable thing for any
individual to be in p issession of coin that no one
else will accept. T iis is the present Australian
danger from the counterfeiter—that he will not do
his work quite well enough. By-and-bye, when
Australia manages its own currency in its entirety,
the counterfeiter will be an ordinary robber of the
State.
* * » *
At the present moment the idea is dawning on
the official mind that something must be done.
The counterfeiter will ultimately be able to profit-
ably produce an exact copy of any given coin from
the present British, U.S.A., French and German
silver currencies— i.e., exact in color, weight, de-
sign and workmanship. It remains to be seen
whether any secret alloy can be introduced into a
wholesale recoinage. A secret alloy is not a very
hopeful stand-by, but it might serve.
* * * *
Gold coinage, under the present dispensation, is
not over-valued. The sovereign is worth a pound in
the melting-pot. Sweating gold coin (hence “sweat-
ing ” labor) is a very old trick. A bag of sovereigns
is shaken violently. The friction of one coin on
another causes wear—the amount of gold worn off
is the profit of the sweater. Or sovereigns are
put to soak in aqua regia, and a thin skin is dis-
solved off each coin. These processes disfigure the
coins, more or less, and the evidence of the
banker’s scales tells the whole story. In America,
gold pieces have been sliced in half, the inside
scooped out and filled with some heavy alloy,
then the slices have been soldered together again ;
this is clever, and may possibly avoid detection, but
it is not sufficiently profitable. In Melbourne, re-
cently, a bank found a sovereign which had
been operated on with a lathe; a fine, con-
tinuous cut was made into the milling all
round the coin ; about 2s. worth of gold was
thus obtained ; the cavity was filled with white-
lead, gilded, and passed on the gentle public.
This trick is clumsy, and easily detected.
* * * *
Of course, bank-notes are forged frequently. In
the States, “ green-goods ” manufacture is a
science, and, at one trial at least, officials refused
to positively swear which of two notes was the
forgery and which genuine. The circumstances
were, however, peculiar, as they related to an
antique pattern of note, without the modern safe-
guards. The Colonial Bank, Melbourne, recently
discovered a fraud on itself from the fact that a
note purported to bear the signatures of two men,
managers of different branches, who had never
seen one another.—Yours, M.
[The illogical part of the above argument is that the
writer assumes the counterfeit-silver trouble to be just
beginning, and the Chinese counterfeiters above-men-
tioned to be the pioneers of the game. Quite possibly
the evil has been going on for years, and half the Austra-
lian silver coin may be bogus, only so well-executed as to
avoid detection. The counterfeiter who was detected was
bowled out, naturally enough, because his coinage wasn’t
good enough. If it had been good enough he wouldn’t
have been bowled out, and no one would have suspected
anything, and if there are other men in the business
whose coinage is good enough they won’t be bowled-out
either. There is a dark suspicion that many thousands
of British shillings are made in Germany, and that vast
quantities of U.S. dollars are manufactured in Mexico,
and that something like 10 or more per cent, of the silver
coinage of the Latin Union is made by private speculators
—but no one knows. Anyone can coin silver with im-
punity if he can only bring the artistic part of the work
to perfection.—Ed. B.]
One Beach, American, who died a few
weeks ago, invented the type-writer, but only
with an idea of doing good to the blind.
If Eight Hours’ celebration committees
had any eye for effect, they would set the men to
march in processions in their working-clothes. A
body of clay-stained sewer-laborers, blue-dungaree-
clad engineers, and blackened stokers would ac-
cord with the eternal fitness of things, while the
spectacle of uncomfortable-looking men, perspiring
in hideously-respectable creased black suits and
tight boots, is only ridiculous. When the shearers,
a few years ago, turned out in bush style, they
attracted more attention than all the gaudy
banners put together. i

Oscar Wilde’s comedy, “ The Importance
of Being Earnest,” opened at Sydney Cri. on
Saturday in the presence of a large audience, and
with the author’s name restored to the bill after a
long absence. It was received with enthusiasm,
and, on the whole, deserved its reception. There
is very little plot about it; Oscar Wilde does not
pile up great masses of mirth after the fashion of
Pinero, or lavish his solid material as that great
artist does. But there is a quaint humor about it
such as no other present-day writer deals in, and
an atmosphere of evening-dress smartness that is
Wilde’s very own. It contains all the bright epi-
grams which the author had left after he wrote
“ Lady Windermere’s Fan ” and one or two other
plays. But in one respect it is better than “ Lady
Windermere.” The characters are not so ineffably
bored among a great deal of expensive furniture ;
they are less suggestive of the worm that dieth
not, with a boiled shirt on, making cynical obser-
vations in a drawing-room ; some of them actually
do things, and don’t look quite dead afterwards
from the exertion. No one could live long in the
atmosphere of Wilde’s comedy without showing
the bad effects of it; the constant struggle to
think of another abnormally smart thing to say
next would produce that agitated drawing-together
of the features in the centre of the face known as
the bicycle-countenance, and would ultimately
tend to iocomotor-ataxy. But it is a very pleasant
atmosphere, none the less, when taken in moderate
quantities. It is so beautifully unreal that a man
goes away from it in a dazed condition and quite
unable to remember his own office address, and
needs to look at the name on his collar to recover
a sense of his own identity. The characters have
no visible means of support save by making
brilliant observations to each other in a richly-
upholstered apartment and trifling affably with a
frivolous cucumber sandwich, but they seem
to get on very comfortably. What The Bul-
letin would like would be to take all the people
out of Oscar Wilde’s comedy, and make them
camp out for three days with swags and large,
indigestible dampers on the banks of a flooded
creek, waiting for a chance to get over to Boggabri
or Bogantungan or Thargomindah or some other
place whose name alone would shock their finer
sensibilities, and see how the dreadful incongruous-
ness of things would pan out. Then it wants to
see these people when they got across, arriving at
Bogantungan by the dirt road and making high-
class remarks as they come. It has no animosity
towards them, of course; it merely wants to try
an experiment.
* * * »
Despite all these loose ravings, ‘ ‘ The
Importance of Being Earnest ” is a good
comedy when not taken too often. It is
bright and cheerful all through, well-con-
structed, with no loose ends hanging out, and
the plot—what there is of it—is clever and effec-
tive. Boucicault, as Algernon, is an artistic gem,
and Cecil Ward is another. Miss Faber, as the
fashion-plate girl in the ruinously-expensive hat,
is one of the most successful society ladies who
has wandered through an impossible comedy this
year, and Miss Hardy gets about the best chance
she has yet had with the B. and B. co., and uses
it admirably. This lady’s pretty face was con-
structed specially by a far-seeing Providence that
she might play the nice, unsophisticated girl under
a large green tree for all the girl and the tree are
worth. Carey, Miss Watt-Tanner and Miss Hill
further assist to let the comedy down gently with
the best results. It is a comedy that requires to
be played in a tender, butterfly spirit; any
attempt to treat it in a vigorous fashion would
produce the same results as if an elephant adopted
a moth and sat on it to keep it warm.

The “ Broad Arrow,” in five acts, is to be
the new sensation at Her Majesty’s on Saturday.
“Hands Across the Sea” has proved too old to
stand any further revival, even the most enthusi-
astic efforts of the Tank—a capable performer,
though rather cold and unemotional—being unable
to make it any newer, so its career comes to a
well-earned conclusion on Friday night. The
new production is “by arrangement with W. J.
Holloway.” Most new plays in Sydney nowadays
6eem to be more or less by arrangement with Plain
Bill Holloway, which prevents The Bulletin
forgetting that person nearly so much as it vvould
like to do. A society for forgetting Holloway is
much needed.

“Djin Djin,” W. and M.’s fairy-tale of
old Japan, is bringing in a continuous stream of
bullion to the Firm’s treasury, and so far the first
beginnings of the falling-cff are not visible. Con-
ndering that three Sydney theatres are just now
travelling on spectacle and tank, this is a good
record.

The great bare-knee spectacle gibbers at
Sydney Royal with the same gibber as mentioned
last week, and the bagpipes and the brass band bray
furiously, and the blaze of red kilts and flags and
the sheen and shimmer of the bayonets strike the
eye with a shock like a tomato at election time.
Bland Holt wears tights under his kilts as a sacri-
fice to respectability, but the rank-and-file don’t,
and the hair on their legs stands out conspicuously
as a guarantee of good faith. Possibly the hair
has something to do with the success of the drama,
or possibly it is the great array of petticoats in
general that pleases the public soul, or possibly it
is the artless way in which Mrs. Bland Holt hangs
her other pair of stockings to dry on the end of
Bland’s bayonet—Bland afterwards gets seven
days for being found with them there, or possibly
’t is Mrs. Holt in knickerbockers sitting on Baker s
love-letter. Anyhow, the kilt drama has distinctly
caught on, and that being so it is no good remon-
strating about the accursed bagpipes, and the
stupidity of a garment that needs to have dumb-
bells hung on to its absurdly brief tail to keep it
down in a high wind.

Sydney is supporting three variety shows
just now, which is a considerable strain on a city
that can hardly support itself. There is nothing
specially novel about any of them this week, so
these remarks are merely intended as an expression
of mild surprise that the whole trio remain above
water.
• The first week of “ Trilby,” at Melbourne
Princess’s, appears to have established a boom.
Clearly the play is certain to draw all readers of
Du Maurier’s book, the majority of whom would
have carefully refrained from patronising a feeble
dramatic adaptation. “ Trilby ”is a pretty, sen-
timental show, with bright bits of “Bohemian”
color in the studio scenes, and a fascinating super-
naturalism running through it. The construction
is as novel as the plot, therefore the effect upon
people who come with no definite ideas as to what
they are about to receive will, generally speaking,
be more impressive than they care to admit at the
time. Australians have a habit of protesting
against being surprised, nevertheless the flavor of a
new variety of performance grows upon them
and ultimately tempts them to return for another
dose. Sometimes “ Trilby ”on the stage doesn’t
quite explain itself to the unenlightened. The
mental subjection of poor little Gecko to Svengali
might be more emphasised in the first act, when
the mesmerist reveals to his pupil his musical de-
signs upon the heroine. Du Maurier’s picture of
Gecko is realised by Mr. E. W. Morrison, who
supports Mr. Fax Svengali admirably.
* * * *
Miss Edith Crane, in the name-part, is not
much less convincing than the two musicians. She
puts no force into her death-scene—which couldn’t,
in any case, avoid seeming a tame incident
after Svengali’s gruesome demise; but she walks
through her part in the must natural style possible,
and looks like an angel born to drive the Parisian
Latin Quarter crazy. Miss Jennie Reiffarth, as
Mdme Vinard, is possibly the cleverest “ old
woman ” artist Australia has seen of late years.
Mr. George Trader brings Zou-Zou to the fore,
and the three painters—Taffy, the Laird, and
Little Billee—improve slightly on acquaintance.
Taffy was a fair success from the start. The
Laird labors heavily with his Scotch accent, and
Billee is handicapped by a much larger head and
fully 20 more years than the character ought to
carry. And the three studio companions are
plainly ’Murkan instead of English. Their
national sing-song elocution bewrayeth them.
Also, it is depressing. Why do so many American
actors and actresses chant the same old tune?
Triiby’s song behind the scenes is sung by Miss
Nagel, whose deep contralto declaration that
“Sweet Alice lies under the stone” justifies a
belief that Ada Crossley will have to look to her
laurels presently. Miss Nagel has a great voice.
* * * *
“ Trilby,” it seems, is either expected by
many people to be a study from the nude, or else
they go to catch a glimpse of the heroine’s bare
feet, which, by the way, are not much in evidence.
Anyway, the man who loans out opera-glasses has
done phenomenal biz. up to date. On Easter
Monday and Tuesday, for the first time on record,
he got rid of all his stock and ran around town
trying to borrow some more.
* * *
“The Enemy’s Camp” began to pine
at Melb. Royal after Easter Monday, and the last
nights of this gaudy entertainment are nearly at
an end. A superfluity of cheap plot seems to be
chiefly the matter with Westmacott’s enterprise.
The author was afraid to let his characters ever
stand around quietly and talk on their
merits, because their conversation will not
bear scrutiny. He kept them eternally on the
move, and some of the moves are so unrea-
sonable, or so exactly similar to the doings
of previous people in former dramas, that public
interest fell away from the Royal when the holi-
days ran out. “ The Enemy’s Camp ” has
received handsome treatment from the manage-
ment. The scenery and etceteras wifi be remem-
bered with gratitude, but the author must prepare
to answer for his conduct at some future time,
unless he happens to have died already, in which
case the worm that never dieth is doubtless ad-
ministering a severe reproof. On Saturday next
(18th) “The Work Girl” conies along to the
Royal. She ran for,several weeks in Sydney, and
should repeat the success in Melbourne, where an
ill-conditioned Hupper ’Ouse has been treating a
Factories Bill with contumely.

At the Alexandra, this week, a hard-work-
ing company is rattling the dry bones of “ Current
Cash ” with much earnestness. Charles Godfrey
and his fire-engine, also the Cosmans, Lentons,
Leslies, Ada Colley, and 20 other stars of various
magnitudes, gleam nightly at the Opera House. A
colossal Eight-hours’ Festival is due at the Exhi-
bition Building on April 21st, and an Easter Fair
is happening upon the same premises!until the
Festival aforesaid takes the flure. Lord Brassey
and suite will appear at the 1 estival.
Though Mistress Grundy frown
And speak with solemn loathing
Of one who did not think it rude
To sit for artists in the nude,
Which means—devoid of clothing ;
Although the matron’s tone
Of indignation shrill be,
For such as seek (but seldom find)
True virtue in the human mind,
The brightest gem of womankind
That ever sparkled will be
Trilby.
She flings her shapely arms
Round other necks than Billee’s,
And thinks no wrong in doing this;
The fragrance of her friendly kiss
Is sweeter than the lilies’.
Long may her bonnie charms
Depicted on a hill be !
We love her ruddy golden hair,
Her white and shapely tootsies bare.
She’s not —no matter, we don’t care,
Our model girl shall still be
Trilby.
A Famous Theatrical Manager.
Janies Cassius Williamson was not born
into the theatrical profession. He waHted mto it
at the ambitious age of 15, and served an arduous
apprenticeship in a company that rushed around
the Western States of ’Murka, seeking what could
be devoured, physically and mentally. Mr. VV U-
liamson has nothing in particular to say of his nrs
acquaintance with speaking parts, except that he,
like other youngsters of the co., had to copy them
out himself from one book of the play provided
by the management, and learn them any time
between midnight and cockcrow. He probably
looks back upon those struggling days with satis-
faction, but doesn’t appear to regret their depar-
ture. Mr. Williamson, indeed, is not an emotional
man off the stage, and for one who has been
(( starred ” in both hemispheres and several ainei-
ent climes he seems about the least self-admirmg
actor on record. He talks of his histrionic career
with difficulty.
* * * *
Youthful J. C. W. came out of the West and
caught the eye of Wnllack, the Wallack, whose old
original theatre was the finest academy of acting
that America has known. Corpedy, ancient and
modern, the Divine Bard, and all sorts of good
work that happened to be then going in England
were produced by Wallack in the best possible
style. He aimed at perfection of detail, and
spared no expense, staging a big show from
London with more thoroughness than the Firm of
W. & M. can take credit for, even nowadays, says
Williamson, who w’orked for seven years as a
member of Wallack’s stock company. Acting,
and plenty of it, was required there. Mr. Wil-
liamson covered a lot of artistic ground during his
seven years’ toiling at the famous New York
house. He became, after a while, the recognised
“dialect comedian,” and was cast for German,
French, Dutch, Yorkshire, or Somersetshire
characters at short notice. He had to interpret
bits of Charles Dickens. When Lotta, in her
prime, played the Marchioness in “ Old Curiosity
Shop,” young Williamson was the Dick Swiveller.
lie padded himself up to the requirements of
Joey Ladle—a well-nigh forgotten person now —in
“No Thoroughfare.” As a Shakespearian comedian
he ranged from Touchstone to Dogberry—a wide
stretch of style. He played Doctor Pangloss, Bob
Acres, and Sir Lucius O’Trigger, and, from the
fact that he dwells half-a-second longer than usual
on those names, one surmises tha J. C. William-
son was particularly happy in old-English comedy.
He went right through the mill at Wallack’s.
After that he betook himself to California with a
reputation, and flourished there for three years.
* * * *
Then the level-headed actor got hold of “ Struck
Oil,” and saw money in it. He suggested altera-
tions in the drama, bought it, married Maggie
Moore, and went on tour with those two valuable
belongings. What Mr. and Mrs. Williamson did
with “Struck Oil” is a tale that has been told
until every experienced kangaroo in the remotest
back-blocks knows it by heart. They first ap-
peared as John and Lizzie Stofel at Salt Lake
City, before a select audience of devout Mormons,
and the blessing of Brigham Young, which passeth
all understanding, descended upon the show like a
dove. The Stofels brought “Struck Oil” to Austra-
lia in 1874, playing fifteen months to unprecedented
business. India was the next country they looted,
after which London. J. C. Williamson and
Maggie Moore presented themselves at the Adel-
phi without much preliminary flourish of trum-
pets, and gave the cockneys 100 consecutive nights
of “Struck Oil.” The play was voted un-Hinglish,
but the “stars,” it was admitted, shone to great
advantage. They became favorites, and on Easter
Monday, 1876, a revival of “ Arrah-na-Pogue ”
was put up for them. The Irish drama ran 100
nights, contrary to the expectation of people who
knew the London market. Chatterton, manager
of the Adelphi, proposed to renew the William-
sons’ engagement for a year, and stage “The
Shaughraun ” without Dion Boucicault’s consent.
The author had somehow failed to get this last of
his Irish dramas copyrighted in England, whereby
it was at the mercy of any conscienceless manager
who might care to use it. Williamson refused to
be a party (a name-party, seeing that he would
have played Conn) to the piratical venture, and the
re-engagement was declined.
* * * *
In 1879, after an absence of about four years,
Mr. Williamson and Miss Maggie Moore came
again to Australia and found the country yearning
fot \ m °re °f them They enjoyed another boom
with Struck Oil. At this time the prosperous
actor was determined to live by his art, and avoid
the worries of management altogether, but cir-
cumstances conquered his resolution. He had
brought out “ Pinafore ” and “The Pirates of
Penzance with him from England, reserving for
himself the parts of Sir Joseph Porter ancf the
Sergeant of Police (Williamson’s humorous render-
ing of the Sergeant is still remembered), and it
came about that John Stofel was forming a comic
opera company—the “ Royal Comic Opera Co
when negotiations with Messrs. Garner and Mus-
grove, who had previously arranged a junction of
w n Va forces, resulted in the triumvirate firm
ol Williamson, Cramer and JVlusgrove,
The senior partner didn’t quite resign himself to
his fate. He dreamed, no doubt, of further
developing his acting powers. A clause in the
partnership deed gave him liberty to plav “ star ”
engagements during six months of the year the
Firm to have first offer. Practically he restricted
actor W llliamson to the service of manager Wil-
liamson and Co. when he signed the bond. To
engage himself elsewhere in Australia would have
been acting against his own managerial interests—
afar°off he He eS Jn°f th ® WOrld ’ il is all situated

parts easily, like a thorough master of his craft
and the parsonic performance (hastily studied it
was remarked at the time) might have grovvn into
a fine piece of work had “Saints and Sinners”
caught on. However, it didn’t catch on and it
was not the I inn s property, but Plain Bill Hollo-
way s, and so J. C. Williamson’s first and only
Australian appearance in that class of production
was soon forgotten. Since then he 1 has been
so much off the stage that the rising generation
in many cases, can’t be persuaded that the res-
ponsible-looking person who surveys the Firm’s
new shows from the managerial box is an accom-
plished all-round actor. Again, a number of
people regard him as a John Stofel only, unless
they happen also to have seen him play Rip, the
Dutchman, or Kerry, the old Irish servant. Very
few know J. 0. Williamson as one who gave pro-
mise of becoming a great actor, but was cut off
before his prime from the fulfilment of the promise
aforesaid. He possesses the stuff of which famous
actors are made, and the piercing eye that charac-
terises them. A pity it is that he doesn’t acquire
a liver complaint and get ordered by the doctor to
resume the “purfesh ” for all he is worth. Capacity
for “ study ” is as strong as ever in manager
Williamson. He mentions casually that he
learned his last part—Uncle Matthew Somebody
in “La Cigale in one night. It was a long
part, too.
* * * *
Theatrical management, says J.C.W., is a busi-
ness nowadays. The Firm has made some fine
strokes, of course. “Silver King,” “The Mi-
kado,” and other Gilbert-Sullivan operas; later
“Ma Mie Rosette” and “Djin Djin,” now re-
peating its Melbourne success in Sydney, are
associated in his mind with delightful treasury
returns. But an Australian success is, at the
most, only a matter of a few weeks right away
in Melbourne and Sydney, and the producer
has no sooner shal e 1 hands with himself on the
first night than he must start considering his next
move. So many successes are required to make a
profitable year’s campaign, hence the Firm’s recent
determination to fix its headquarters at Melb.
Princess’s and run all its shows from the one
place. Partner Musgrove, says Williamson, wrote
most despondent letters from England a while ago.
The weary traveller saw nothing going °iri
London that could be expected to please Aus-
tralia — i.e., nothing available in the way of
dramatic stars, no good new’ dramas or comedies,
no comic operas worth a second thought. So he
turned to America for novelties. “ Trilby ” will
be followed by Mrs. Potter and Bellew, and pre-
sently comes “ A Trip to Chinatown,” with Nat
Goodwin, best of American comedians, as central
attraction. Nothing short of the best will do
says J. C. Williamson. He would sigh, possibly’
if such windy inspirations of forced breath were
not unbusinesslike. “You might mention that
the public and the press are rather hypercritical,”
he suggests. But “Trilby”! The advance
booking for “ Trilby ” is very gratifying.
At Poverty Point.
Manager Williamson’s ukase, forbidding Trilby Troupers
wearing natural flowers on the stage, is said to have much
annoyed one actress. Leaves scattered on the Princess
boards have caused more than one accident, and “the
firm ” will not allow Trilby limbs to risk others.
The heart of Melb. femaledom has gone out to George
Trader, the Zou Zou of the “Trilby” co., whilst E. VV.
Morrison, as the aesthetic Gecko, holds a good second
place. Trader is the Boucicault of the co., a thorough
artist —in fact, strongly resembling Dion B. as the
Amazonian Grival. Next to Boucy’s, his is the best Anglo-
French yet heard on the Australian stage.
Veteran Dick Stewart, Nellie’s pa, succeeds George
Tallis as treasurer at Melb. Princess’s, the latter being
promoted to the business-managership, vice Harry Mus-
grove.
Brough and Boucicault’s advt.-hypocrisy in suppressing
Oscar Wilde’s name has come to an end ; Sydney Tele-
graph boldly mentions the excluded author; but S.M.
Herald, in its first notice of “ The Importance of Being
Earnest,” still carefully avoids direct reference to him.
Has anybody ever noticed whether the rev. staff of the
Herald now positively name Judas Iscariot ? or do they
still cautiously refer to him as “ a certain person guilty of
deplorable conduct which every right-thinking person
must condemn ” ?
Dot Boucicault says he is tired of contradicting the
rumor that he is going to London to marry Pattie Browne.
Rumor has engaged the amiable Dot to every unmarried
female member of his co., past or present.
The British Examiner of Plays prohibits the production
of “ Joseph of Canaan ” in the Land of Beer and Podsnap
on the ground of its Biblical origin !

Three theatrical divorces at next Sydney court.
Edith Crane is one of the seven actresses who a little
while back were simultaneously playing the part in the
States. The critics unanimously acclaimed her the Trilby.
She is a sister of Walter Crane, the famous artist, and has
two other handsome sisters the “ dead image ” of her.
Melbourne Hebrews are writing to the papers objecting
to the aspersions upon the Chosen Race by impersona
tions like Svengali. Seeing that this picturesque Jew li-
the only brainy character in the book, and is mentally and
artistically' miles ahead of any of the others, it is hard to
see where the grievance conies in.
Mr. James South, that old-established member of the
“ purfesh,” is to have a matinee benefit next Wednesday
at Her Majesty’s (Sy'dney), lent by Woods and Marshall
for the occasion. J. A. Rainford manages, and a lot of
favorite mummers will assist.
“Dot” Boucicault’s baptismal name is not Dion, but
George Darley Boucicault. The real Dion, jun., was ar
elder brother, who was killed in an English railway acci
dent in ’76. The Edinburgh to London train met with a
bad smash in one of the midland counties, and, managing
to escape with a slightly' injured arm, Boucicault started
to help the more seriously' injured passengers out of the
wreck. While thus humanely engaged, a second train
thundered down into the debris of the first, completing
the fearful destruction and killing Boucicault outright
George Darley then assumed the name of the deceased
brother.

than lighteous, and his own point is in gloating secretly
over the studies of the nude in the studio of the three
painters, with the facial expression of a greasv 16-stone

Trader, who plays Zou Zou in “ Trilby,” at Melb. Prin-
cess’s, is small and clever, vaguely suggestive of Bouci-
cault. This little, mercurial Frenchman is a characterisa-
tion full of animation and snap. With the exception of
Webster, who plays Little Billee like a tailor’s assistant,
the distinct weaknesses of the co. are all local.
Reuben Fax, the Svengali of the “Trilbv” co.,probably
eats onions to lend verisimilitude to his lank, threadbare
unkempt, uncombed, hooked and grimy Hebrew. One
feels instinctively when he comes on that he moves in the
odour of shallots, and should be called Svengarlic.
The reign of the Sydney aquariums is over ; 1000 adults
on a holiday is now considered big biz., while £4 or £5
taken on Sunday makes the managerial bosom heave with
pleasure. A few years ago, 5000 admissions on a holiday,
and £3O on Sunday, was only reckoned fair. The fall is
inexplicable.
The Sydney public found out the real use of the
Dornngton last week. When that gentleman's stupend-
ous limbs are encased in the pants of the musical hussar
in “ Dandy Dick,” they serve a great and poetic purpose.
A competition between Dorrington’s legs as the hussar
Baker’s as the lieutenant in “ One of the Best,” and the
legs of Scot Inglis as the captain in “ The Enemy’s Camp,”
ought to draw well. The Bulletin reckons that Dorring-
ton and Baker should run a dead-heat.
The general impression at Sydney Cri. last week seemed
to be that Mrs. Brough’s Second "Mrs. Tanquerav is even
better than it used to be ; that the lengthy Dorrington’s
representation of the beery George Horrid is also improv-
ing with age ; that Miss Watt-Tanner is a rather inferior
substitute for Miss Romer; and that Miss Faber and
Grace Noble, as Saint Ellean, run practically neck and
neck, any advantage being with the former.
Edith Crane, as Trilby, suggests a youthful Nellie
Stewart in many ways, particularly in little tricks of the
voice. In the singing act, with her golden hair a-hanging
down her back and clothed in sumptuous raiment, she is
a large edition of the winsome Nellie in the second act of
“ Ma Mie Rosette.”
Some of the most effective bits in “Trilby” happen off
the stage. To wit, the illusion, so perfect as to deceive
the audience, of Svengali’s piano and Gecko’s violin play-
ing ; the contralto voice that sings “Ben Bolt;” the
vigorous cheering, and then the wild uproar in the
theatre; and, lastly, the play of green limelight on the
Jew’s glittering eye.
Inigo Tyrell, charged with the manslaughter of a bar-
rister in Melbourne, is a man who would have found it
very difficult to get a fair trial in that city a few years
ago. People have mostly forgotten Tyrell’s awful dramas
by this time, and can take a dispassionate view of his
case, but a time was when it would have been necessary
to shift the venue to the mallee country to give Tyrell a
fair run for his liberty.
Reuben Fax—what a stage-name, after Cholmorideley
Montmorency, or even Howard Vernon !
Rignold, booked to open at Melb. Royal on Aug. Ist,
for an extended season, will have difficulty in getting a
decent co. together, as things now are. Westmacott has
now snapped up most of his men, and that aspiring
manager has been so successful and become so popular
that he is not likely to lose them. It is likely that G.R.
will prevail on one or two of the ’Murkan “Trilby”
mummers to linger here awhile. Some of them are
anxious to stay on.
The Wild-Cat Column.
When the Mutual Life of Victoria wanted to
invest £20,000 recently in Vic. Government stock it had
to go all the way to London to get it, because there was
practically none in the local market. Presumably it will
also have to collect the interest in London and "hump it
laboriously back to Melbourne. The chairman of the
Union Trustee Co., at the recent annual meeting, lamented
on the same subject : “We have a great difficulty in
finding safe investments for our trust funds, even at a
low rate of interest. It would be a great convenience and
a great public benefit if the Government would issue con-
sols locally and apply the proceeds to the re-purchase in
Great Britain of an equal amount of debentures current in
the old country.” But then the Government has grovelled
so long to the British money-lender that it really can’t
get out of the habit. Apropos of which, Melbourne Age
advocates a comprehensive scheme for locking the Murray
and the Darling to make them navigable through their
whole length. “ The amount required,” it cheerfully
adds, “ could readily be obtained in the London market
by a loan.” The press has been on this subject so long
that if you found an Australian journalist delirious from
thirst 70 miles from the nearest waterhole, and partially
revived him with a long, cool drink so that his baked
tongue could talk, he would sit up among the glare and
the saltbush and state mechanically that a loan ought to
be floated on the London market.

Some more scraps from the evidence of the City
of Melbourne Bank auditors “ I did not go into details,
but accepted the assurance of Mr. Robertson. I gave a
certificate in favor of an appropriation for £5OOO on
Northey and Biddeley’s account. I could not explain how
interest on t. account was taken into profits, but it was
possible the account was good when it was reduced by
£5OOO. It would not be proper, as a rule, to take interest
to profits on an appropriated account, but there might be
a satisfactory explanation. I could not explain how it
was that interest on W. L. Jackson’s account was taken to
profits after an appropriation for £2OOO had been made.
The proceeding could not be defended without explana-
tion. . . . Mr. Longmuir (the manager) was in a posi-
tion to know more about the affairs of the bank than we
were. We were satisfied with his explanation. We are
not expected to direct the policy of the bank. ... I
did not make close enquiries as to (Turner’s) securities. I
went by what Mr. Longmuir told me. ... If the

The proposal of Premier Reid to combine the
N.S.W. P.O. and Commissioners’Bavings’Banks, and utilise
the funds in cheap loans to sugar-growers and others, is a
proposition which has two distinct sides to it. One of
them—the sugar-growers’ side —is that it will mean loans
at comparatively low interest, but loan-money won’t keep
the industry alive ; no industr}' ever was kept alive by
borrowing only. The other side that of the de-
positors— is as follows: (1) All the money in the
Savings’ Banks is practically money at call, there-
fore to invest it in what will necessarily be long
mortgages is a risky proceeding, unless a large margin
is retained. The S.A. and M.L. State Land Banks
l 5 18 bo,TOwed for a long period ; not call

in l ’ admitt ed)y a sinking industry ; and to lend money
nu-l S V ms t< ( , a class wh °se occupation is fast dying
tj £ ' ooka reckless. (3) The Commissioners’ Savings
alt?,,'p already a very l a me sum lent on mortgage at
ao-.-J.mt p . cent -> and 't is proposed to lend this to
Omt. U * , or 5 P erc ent. it only means that the
Government violently confiscates part of the interest of
tne poorest class of depositors to assist the sugar and
other industries. The depositors will probably stand it,

but the device is pretty rough on them all the same.

Premier Kingston seems to have altogether
missed the kernel of the State Life Insurance idea, when
ne says that a State office will be started unless the
existing societies treat their clients “liberally.” The
present societies treat the public as liberally as they can
without going bankrupt; there is even a danger that
competition may tempt some of them to be too liberal.
u 8 v ni °re liberality that is wanted, but absolute security,
wmch oniy the State can give. If Kingston means to
rush the private offices into a violent course of further
liberality he is only urging them to recklessness and
possible insolvency.

A scheme is on foot in Melbourne to form a
huge assets co. which will take over the ruins of several
large, busted concerns now winding up. The ruins in
each case would be valued as carefully as possible, and
the new co. would issue its own scrip for the amount to
the creditors, who could sell it if they wanted money.
Ihe savmg ought to be very large. There would be one
liquidator and one office and office staff instead of a dozen.
Ihe expenses being thus reduced it is probable that the
interest and rents received from the ruins would pay all
charges and leave a margin of profit, and in that case the
co. could go slow with its realisation and wait for better
times and better prices. And by waiting it would help to
bring about better prices; a great deal of the present
depreciation is caused by the efforts of several dozen com-
panies to rush their property simultaneously on to a sick
market. Still, the prospects of the scheme don’t amount
to much. Nobody has any serious faith in anybody
else s scheme these days.

Considering all the lame apologies which have
been offered for the downfall of the Melbourne land and
mortgage co’s, based on the “depreciation of property,”
this fact is worth considering. The depreciation, from the
top of the boom to the very bottom of the depression, as
shown by the municipal valuations of Melbourne and
suburbs, was about 25 per cent. There were sane and re-
liable valuations to be got even in the maddest times of
the boom, else the municipalities couldn’t have got them.
A mortgage co. or land bank or building society which
simply lent out its own funds on city property, up to 60
per cent, of that easily-available valuation, need not have
lost a penny by the smash—the biggest one in Australian
history even if its business had been confined to the
capital. If it had traded in the country, vvhere there was
practically no slump at all, it might have made profits
much as usual. The Conservatives, who keep on asserting
that a State Land Bank must go broke when a collapse
conies, are invited to seriously consider these figures.

Perkins’s Brewery Co. (Brisbane) is one of the

profit and loss £18,593.

The secretary of the Melbourne Farmers’ Mutual
Loan and Building Society explains that his institution is
constructed on the terminating principle (a fact not set
forth in the published prospectus), which removes the
principal objections alluded to in last week’s issue. The
chief objection which remains is that Victoria wants a
State-managed, or at least State-audited, Land Bank with
about £10,000,000 of capital to lend at low rates ; and a
private concern with £300,0. 0, though a distinct move in
the right direction, isn’t large enough to make much im-
pression on the mortgage evil. Still, the Farmers' Mutual
is a move in the right direction.

The balance-sheet of the Mutual Assurance
Society of Victoria appears in this issue. The Bulletin
has already commented on this document (in its issue of
March 21) as a highly satisfactory statement. Deprecia-
tion has been written off remorselessly, and every effort
made to put the securities on a bedrock valuation, which
is the first thing to be considered. Safety, not glare and
big bonuses, is the prime consideration in life insurance.

The interesting spectacle of J. Bull writhing
under a tax on absentees’ incomes from local investments
was provided at Tas. Supreme Court the other day, when
the Emu Bay and Waratah Railway Co. tried hard to
wriggle out of paying tax on its debenture-interest. The
co. is a London co., and has floated debentures in London,
and its net receipts aren’t enough to pay the guaranteed
interest to the debenture-holders. Still, it pays the
debenture-holders a little, and on this little the Govt,
demanded income-tax. The co. fought, apparently, to
bring home to the minds of its debenture-holders the
astounding fact that Tasmania really wanted their
shekels, for last year’s Act left it no leg, or even a
pretence of a leg, to stand upon. So the Chief Justice
easily decided ; and the co. went away and wept its cash
into the hands of Treas. Fysh.

From Melbourne Age of April 7:—“The fol-
lowing paragraph from the Citizen, one of the leading
financial authorities in England, shows a fine appreciation
of Freetrade tactics.” Then the Age quotes a paragraph
stolen by the Citizen from Tiie Bulletin, concerning the
“drawback” practices of Melbourne softgoods importers.
The Age, being “ respectable,” declines to steal direct
from the loathsome Bulletin. The Bulletin comments,
like some wines, are much improved by a sea voyage in
wood and a return voyage in bottle.

Jumping has had another set-back in N.S.W. —
this time at Cobar, where an effort was made to secure a
part of the mining property known as the Peak by in-
forming the Govt, of some small informality on the part
of the 'owners. The warden dismissed the application,
and the jumpers were hooted. The public also expressed
approval of the result in a street demonstration. The
low-«Tade mines of Cobar are attracting attention in the
mining market, and people realise that nothing would
discourage investment quicker than jumping, whether
successful or not. In this instance Barrass and Conley,
by their wonderful discovery, have opened up a part of
Cobar which had been abandoned for years. They have
had about 39000 z. gold and divided nearly £10,090, and
are now running 10 heads on what would be called mul-
lock if it did not go from 2oz. to 3oz. to the ton. If this
mine is as good as it looks, it is one of the mineral wonders
of the world, but what it is really worth remains for time
and work to prove.

Another good-looking show has turned up in the
vicinity of the Royal Standard mine, N.S.W.—The

in one small camp.

lng prove this to be a weak plea, the directors will kick
themselves that they did not accept the £65,000 offered
for the mine last year.

Quite a sensation in Melbourne last week,

streak had almost disappeared. Rig returns from a
pocket and bigger newspaper gush boosted the shares up
to £BOO, and the sorrow of the men who bought at big
prices is indescribable.

In J. B. Jaquet the N.S.W. Mines Dept, has
at any rate one man unafraid to venture an opinion in his
reports. Big things have recently been said of the rich-
ness of Surface Hill, Wattle Flat, N.S.W. Says Jaquet:
“ I am of opinion that the chances are against any of
these pyrites veins being worked profitably at a depth.
Their great richness at the surface is without doubt due
to a natural process of concentration. The hill was
originally much higher than we see it to-day. Under
the ordinary processes of denudation the rock, of
which it is composed, and the auriferous pyrites veins
ramifying through it, would be slowly worn away. The
pyrites veins would succumb before the country rock, and
the greater portion of the gold as it was set free would
fall downwards and be retained within the walls of the
veins.”

.James Thomson, formerly of Melb. Standard,
tells in a Melb. paper of the early glories of the Mur-
chison (W.A.): —“One of the first sensations is Ains-
worth’s Last Chance. They had not been working long
before they struck stone that was so rich that it returned
2000 oz. to the ton by the primitive means of dollying.
There were five partners in the find, and they decided to
erect a small three-head battery. It was an extraordinary
thing, but the machinery had to be stopped on more than
one occasion owing to the gold working up between the
stampers and clogging portions of the battery On
one of the many occasions that I have been to this mine I
brought up the ladders in my own hands a small quantity
of quartz which I dollied myself for a return of 440 z. of
pure gold to the value of £4 Is. per ounce. It is one of
the show places of the Murchison, and generally regarded
as one of the crack mines. Further on there is
another show-mine, the Goleonda, which was originally
worked in a primitive fashion in the earlier days
of its existence. I have seen the owners dis-
tributing among themselves the week’s proceeds,
which were pickle-bottles full of dollied gold. A few
pennyweights more or less in one of them did not signify.
In fact, tiie Murchison has had sensational proceedings
as well as Coolgardie. but no one was booming the Mur-
chison, and consequently little was heard of it.” And yet
the total value of all the gold produced from the great
Murchison field, according to the official returns, is not
much over 100,000 oz 150,0000 z. all told. Seventy-
five tons of stone from J. Thomson’s wonderful mine
would have accounted for it all, leaving the several hun-
dred other mines to produce nothing among them.
Westralia is a weird land where 72 mines, yielding from
lOoz. to lOOoz. to the ton are discovered every week, and
bucketfuls of pure gold are hauled out of shafts and
served round in pickle-bottles—and yet the net result,
when it gets into cold print, shows that, barring S.A.
only, Westralia is, so far, the very poorest gold province,
in proportion to its size, in Australasia.
W. A. gold output for March is declared to be
11,0840 z. On this “auspicious occasion” the Murchison
beats Coolgardie, the respective returns being 45940 z. and
46430 z. Dundas comes along with its 210 z., and even
beats Ashburton, with 9oz. No wonder the W.A. boom
in London is dead. A large increase is promised in the
near future. It has been promised for two years, and the
same old wheeze—want of water, machinery, proper gold-
saving processes, railway communication, &c., are doing
duty still. The writer admits the probability of an in-
creased output shortly. It may be more than double this
month’s return. It would want to be 10 times the quan-
tity to pay the cost of its getting, and to disprove The
Bulletin’s contention that the W.A. gold-boom will be
known as the great fraud of the century.

Fulton’s 20-head stamp mill, erected on the
Murchison for public crushing, having proved a dead
letter in that respect, has been sold for removal. Its
failure is excused on the ground that the syndicate own-
ing it had no working capital. True, it takes money to
run a public battery at Cue.
Golden Zone, Kalgoorlie (Saturday) : 40 tons,
410 oz. “ The stuff is a fair average of the big lode forma-
tion in the mine.” If true, then, the mine is worth a
million. What are the odds Tuesday proves it 41oz. ?
These mistakes always occur one way.

Thus a W.A. paper : “The Royal (Royal !) Ex-
change deserves the goodwill of pressmen, as the com-
mittee has decided to admit the accredited press to the
morning private call, and, furthermore, allow them the
privilege of buying and selling—liberality which I believe
is fully appreciated by the members of the fourth estate.”
The Coolgardie jobbers are well up to their business.
* * * *
Brown Hill, Kalgoorlie : “It is understood that
the first crushing will “ average 3 to 3joz. per ton of fair
average scone n sight of the mine.” The public have
been led to understand that it would be at least double
that. Preparing for a fall, evidently. It is not understood
that this mine is poor in the bottom ; but—time will tell.

Cue wire : “Another shoot of ore has been
struck in the Mainland Consols, and several bags of rich
stone have been secured.” How consoling to the British
shareholders, who bought this mine at 10 times its value,
and have since spent on it far more than it is worth.
“ Several bags of rich stone ” well describes it. A manager
who came from England to look after it was so amazed at
the mine that he left it. His report is :An occasional
bagful of good ore, but the bulk too poor to crush.

Monzies wire: “The new find reported from
Mt. Margaret district, a couple of days ago, proves to be
a very big thing.” We are then told of a few rich slugs,
and that the find has been called the Golden Cliff, no
doubt because gold “can be traced all over the hill.”
Reported only two days, and yet proved to be a very big
thing'. It may be —but all the same this is the sort of
stuff from W.A. that has made the Australian public tired
and at last has disgusted J. Bull, Esq., himself. What
has become of all the other Mt. Margaret pocket-finds
na le over a year ago ? The Queen of the Earth, to wit,
whose gold-shoot could be covered with a man’s hat?

The Kalgoorlie papers head their account of the
railway ceremonies in this wise : “The Kalgoorlie Rail-

of the feeling on the subject of railways between the two

place, and the proposal of Coolgardie to agdtate for the
starting of the Menzies’ line fills Kalgoorlie with inarticu-
late wrath.

Stated that there is a move in London to amalga-
mate Barley's and Bavley’s South with a view of finding
£50,000 working capital. The first has a capital of £480,000,
but none to work on. It is a great object-lesson of the public
“ haves” committed in the name of mining. Where are
the waste dumps which experts and every metropolitan
newspaper in Australia described as worth 2 to 3oz. to the
ton? Unmoved and uncrushed because they are worth-
less. Where are the rich finds made in every level of the
mine according to public wires? Echo replies that they
were never made. Eor months the mine lived on accumu-
lated gold got out of the mine many months before. Its
richness went out at less than 100 ft., and could have been
covered in a hop, step and a jump in length. Its barren-
ness was palpable to every man who could distinguish a
mine from a lime-kiln, but the newspapers, partly
through the dense ignorance of their representatives,
fostered this gigantic boost, and have never had the com-
mon decency to apologise.

The cleverest bit of acting in the per-
formance of the “Birds”of Aristophanes, at Melb.
University, the other day, was that of the Greek
priest who begins the sacrifice to the bird-gods.
It was a capital caricature of the sanctimonious
drawl of a high-church curate reciting the Litany,
and was so well done that the clergymen present
were by no means pleased.

Iri the window of a city shop during
Easter week there was exhibited a large crude
painting representing a young girl in a bedroom
in a state of nudity, being urged by a figure
in the orthodox form of the devil in the direc-
tion of the bed. Underneath this bed a serpent
was coiled, while a ticket in bad handwriting
beneath the picture bore the one word, “Sin.”
A footnote stated that the painting was the handi-
work of a rev. gentleman, and that another picture
of the same kind, entitled, “ The Result of Sin,”

The wretched N.S.W. woman, convicted
the other day of poisoning her husband with
strychnine, will possibly not be hanged, she hav-

local court with insanity. Ihe history of the
crime boiled down : There was no baby, and, at
the mature age of 45, she avenged her grievance
with the deadly alkaloid. The feature m the
case was that, though she was possessed of LI ,
she declined to engage counsel, but insisted on
defending herself despite th“ T ''dge s warning.

Editor Bulletin, — You have a lot to say
about Jay Pees just now, but let me assure you
that the stipendiary magistrates of the small
country towns are not all immaculate. The out-
side suitor usually comes off second best urdess the
case is very dry and plain. Also, the lawyers of
the small towns won’t push cases against local big
wigs who can put plenty biz. in their way. When
you have a law-suit in, say, Gerabundamine, if
you are a Uitlander you will, if you have sense,
bring an outside lawyer to fight your case —one
who has no business connections in Gerabunda-
mine. An expensive plan, truly, but the only way
to keep the local trap and beak in order. I talk
from experience.—H.
Westralia is just now a happy hunting-
ground for the journalistic blackmailer. Those
engineering shady concerns are always good game
while honest men, if worked judiciously, will
generally come to terms on the score of expe-
diency, accepting blackmailing as one of the con-
ditions of the country—just like the sand and flies
and the absence of water. The “ publicity ”of a
great many journals is a marketable commodity,
exchanged sometimes for cash, sometimes for ad-
vertising. Some much-advertising Westralian
visitors could speak feelingly on the subject. On
hearing that a certain young “ pusher ” was on his
way to the country, a much-professing journal
began gathering together all the nasty comment
on the youth which was available. And published
it on his arrival, of course, so that brazen empti-
ness might be confounded ? Not a bit of it
Showed it to him. The young man shelled out.
Gov. Buxton, from one point of view, lias
proved a failure. Since his arrival in S.A. lie has
given Adelaide society absolutely nothing to talk
about. Apparently H.E. goes to bed at 8.30 p.m.
and never goes round the town o’ nights in a
hansom.

In a recent M.L.
divorce-suit. She was
ordered to give the three
children over to the hus-
band, who had secured a
decree. Then she opened
up on the Judge, and said
that neither he nor his
law could tear the young-
sters from their mother —
‘‘ I will rather tie them
round my waist and
jump into the harbor.”
Here the Bench raised
its eye-brows, but the
poor stricken woman con-
tinued : “ Possession is
nine points of the law
—well, He will have to
prove they are his child-
ren, and it’s a wise father
who knows his own
child.” Exactly and
that is why the law of
most countries has up to
now provided that adul-
tery alone shall be, a
ground for divorce in the
case of the woman and
not of the man.
A member of the financial squad, released

A BIRD-SONG.
A mission'ry's calling I try to combine
With the trade of a Melbourne J.P.,
Which is mighty obliging of one with a fine
Flow’ry genealogical tree ;
For I claim descent true from (Treat Brian Boru,
And from Shakespeare and Caesar and Pym,
And Kong-foo-tsee and old Mo of Judee,
And the rest of the Scriptural swim.
For I’m Dicky Bird, Dicky Bird, tweak, tweak
tweak,
The poetry flows when I speak, speak, speak ;
I’m a sort of impossible freak, freak, freak,
A modern immaculate beak, beak, beak.
It s always been one of my hobbies to seek
Each feminine golden-haired sinner,
And start by a method considered unique
To develope the good that is in her ;
So why should they cavil if into some park
Of an evening we happen to stray ?
For the best of development’s done in the dark-
bo the expert photographers say.
For I’m Dicky Bird, &c.

FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.
My Amy, on her good days,
Is the sweetest creature going ;
We gaily chat of this or that
The while she does some sewing;
From time to time I pinch, or pat,
Her cheeks with pleasure glowing.
On Amy’s very good days
No wrathful storm I could, raise
To vex her with its blowing;
I’m “ Dear old boy ! my cup of joy
Is full to overflowing.
But Amy, on her bad days,
Has “ tantrums ” past all bearing ;
We snarl and snap, until, mayhap,
I quit her presence swearing ;
Her face, which well deserves a slap,
A scornful smile is wearing.
On Amy’s very bad days
She drives me into mad ways,
Dislike for me declaring.
Her parting scoff is “ Break it off ! ”
I totter home despairing.
She has her inbetween days,
When (though I’ve known her kinder)
I call her ‘ ‘ pet, ” and much regret
The swear-words that maligned her;
She tells me not to feel upset,
And says I “ mustn’t mind her.”
On Amy’s inbetween days,
Bewitched by her serene gaze,
My blind love groweth blinder ;
I kiss her brow and make a vow
To take her as I find her.

A FABLE.
A lam stood on a stony rise with very little grass,
When by that way a kangaroo did per adventure pass.
“ Oh ! pretty lam,” the old man crys, “ why do you feed
on sand,
When over yonder desert lys the rich of richest land.”
And, seizing up the lam, he guyed, nor did he stop or tire
Till on the other blooming side he found tha’d bin a fire.
They warn’t half a blessed blade or drop of water round,
The ashes what the tussicks made was all the feed they
found.
“ Ah ! better bare the hills we have,” the lam soliliqide,
“ Than fly to others known not of,” then turned it up and
dide.

description of Copenhagen, wherein it was de-

had occurred there for 20 years, and social scandals
were unheard of. The following day editor Reay

one of whom managed to get a letter inserted
denying the ’Murkan’s statements point blank.

Here is a curious (and literally true) experi

one night. X was overtaken by a woman, who
requested me to pay for the pie which 1 had
just abstracted from her stock. Utterly be-
wildered, I went back with her to her pastry-
cook’s shop, and was promptly identified by
the boy behind the counter as the person who
had just eloped with a pie. The thing was
ridiculous, but the woman was firm. Dither
payment for the pie or- —a policeman 1 I
wouldn’t pay, and was marched off accord-
ingly to the station. But the sergeant in
charge, who happened to know me pretty
well, dropped on to his subordinate
pretty hard. “ Get back to your
me man ; you’re a janius,
an’ no mistake ! Meet me to-
morrow at 2, Mr. X, an’ we’ll see
if we can’t clear this up.” Next
day we went to the shop, the boy
was produced, and to him the
sergeant, in a voice of thunder:
‘•Tell the truth, ye young divil, or
I’ll take ye away wid me ! Didn’t
ye ate that pie yerself, an’ then, for fear twould be
missed, ye pinted out the first man passm as
havin’ tuck it ? ” And the boy, blubbering, owned
up.—X. [The correspondent happens to be a
newspaper-man. The policeman, therefore, had
against him a strong priina facie case of pie-
stealing.—Ed. B.]

A weird, strangely-ruinous Chow was run
down, the other day, in Sydney. For 18 months
past this specimen has been known to be in active
decomposition, but though his hands and .feet and
the other visible parts of him were m a state too
awful for description he was allowed to supply the
infected vegetable to Belmore markets without
interference until one day last week. Ihen the
intelligent constable overhauled him and took him
to Little Bay with much difficulty, the ancient
and fish-like adversary making a desperate resist-
ance. It is officially announced that tin case is
not leprosy but only psoriasis which is about as
scaly as the other thing though not quite so viru-
lent This fact shows that the public should not
rush too hastily to conclusions about its leper, and
should sort him out carefully to avoid
standings, and that when it finds the microbe
dreaming on the dinner-cabbage it should inspect
it in a dispassionate spirit and not jump to a
decision without sufficient evidence.

The Melb. burglar must feel the hard

It is suggested that the recurrence of
heated coal cargoes at Newcastle, N.S.W., may
cast some light on the ghastly disappearance rate
of vessels leaving that port. But when a ship is
destroyed by fire, some vestige of her is usually
left. And she burns slowly : the sailors have
generally ample time to take to the boats, and to
cast overboard a message telling their fate. It is
the sinister peculiarity of vessels disappearing
from Newcastle that the ocean swallows them up
absolutely. Crews, boats, wreckage, messages—
nothing is left behind. Such a constancy of utter
destruction is only explicable on the theory that
shifting cargo founders the ship almost in an

Not only in the towns,
but in the bush, John
Chinaman looks after
his creature comforts.
When a mob of Chows
take even a three
months’ contract, they
at once erect a break-
wind and dig a small
garden. With plants
from the nearest garden
and salading seeds, in
four weeks they have
pak-rhoi, or Chinese
cabbage, lettuces, and
radishes. In summer,
if the contract lasts six
months, they have all
sorts of greens. Sam-
shui, Chinese brandy,
is always in the camp;
very often a bottle of
spirits to entertain
whites with. Never
short of a smoke, they
do not cadge, and they
don’t quarrel. It is
their comfort (as they
want it and acknow-
ledge it) that is the
danger of their resid-
ence. I cannot per-
ceive any diminution
in hired Ch inkies since
the LlOO poll-tax. An-
nual poll-tax or license
to Chow employers is
apparently the only way
to shunt them. —Scotty

Some intelligent Newcastle (N.S.W.) col-
liery owners, as well as miners, are said to think
that a strike just now would not be such a bad
thing, for the reason that, as a consequence of
former blundering strikes, men and masters were
glad to resume work on any terms. The latter
entered into low contracts which permit of neither
good wages nor profits. If the men laid down
their tools for a week, such contracts would be
cancelled.

In the new mission steamer, John Wil-
liams, the crew’s quarters are placed right aft, and
the berth for the native teachers and their wives
forward—this owing to experience gained on the
old mission boat in which the quarters adjoined.

with the seventh commandment—for religion
among the islanders by no means signifies
asceticism.

“IT’S A POOR RULE,” &c.
She was a fair, frail, timid thing,
With wild, wide eyes, and he a plain
And portly person slumbering
With strident snores that shook the train ;
And, while he slept, at stations passed
Two dames had left, but nothing broke
His dreams of home, until at last
A jolt severe contused his ear,
And he expanded and awoke,
And found, with tremors in each limb,
That timid girl alone with him.
She crouched, and from her corner eyed
The gentle citizen with dread,
And his perturbed face implied
A wish that he was safely dead.
They neither spoke, but sorely vexed
With grim suspicions watched to see
What awful thing would happen next.
The lovely maid at length displayed
A mad desire to rise and flee.
She’d plainly lost her few poor wits,
And warnings gave of coming fits.
The man arose, the maiden screamed.
He looked out on the flying dales,
Then spoke a prayer (or so it seemed)
And flung himself upon the rails.
The people yelled. They stopped the train,
And to the nearest station bore—
Now crippled, and convulsed with pain—
The portly man, and all the van
Was stained and stippled with his gore.
“ At least,” they say, who tell the tale,
“ Poor chap, he didn’t die in gaol ! ”

Sydney, April 14, 1896.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
The Agricultural Society’s maiden ball at Sydney
Town Hall was a great social success and a bril-
liant spectacle, with lavish decorations of waving
palms, coats-of-arins, and a pair of floral shields
with Lady Hampden on one side and Sir T. E.
Buxton on the other—the S. A. Gov.’s shield being
rather originally punctuated with a soul-stirring
full-stop after the “Sir.” Otherwise all was well
in a decorative sense. Sustenance was pictur-
esquely spread in the basement, floor and music
were admirable, and the only hitch was the tardy
arrival of the vice-regalities, who long kept the
committee cooling its heels on the marble steps,
and lengthened the w’nite-and-gold card of twenty
dances by several vicarious extras. There was not
a very surging attendance at the Show ball, but
as only a limited number of tickets had been
issued the committee was no doubt well-satisfied
with the turn-out, which was more like a club than
a public ball.
Lady Hampden carried the lovely posy pre-
sented by the Society, which harmonised with her
gown of pale bronze satin with puff ball sleeves
and folds of violet velvet —a coronet of purple
velvet surmounted by three diamond stars and
diamond brooches and necklace being the Y.R.
etceteras. Her Excellency’s gyrations in the
official square were —well, somewhat informal. I
never saw anyone more hopelessly at sea in the
third figure than Lady H. (dancing with the
president of the Agricultural Society) who moved
as stiffly as a ramrod and wouldn’t sanction the
“ hands-across ” movement or hold any lady by
more than I 'the button of h;r love. And Gov.
Hampden standing up with Mrs. John See (in
flesh-pink to the finger-tips and pretty diamonds)
had to be shown the way by Gov. Buxton, who
wears his star like a teething-ring and seems to
possess a very light and fantastic toe indeed.
Lively Mrs. Freeman-Thomas, in cream brocade
and a pink rose or so, created a diversion by
cutting a sort of flip-flap in the second vice-regal
set; Miss Buxton, who always looks as if she has
a lolly in her mouth, but who, like all the vice-
regal damsels, has the art of conversation, wore a
white satin skirt-shaped like a three-cornered tart
and pink trimmings on the bodice ; Miss Brand
wore pink satin veiled in white chiffon ; her sister,
all white; Mrs. Rupert Carington, pink and
white—indeed, pink appeared on everybody, in-
cluding the wife of ex-Premier Parkes in pink
silk and chiffon, who sat beside her rococo
bridegroom and was introduced to the contents of
the dais by a well-meaning aide. The handsome
wife of the vice-president adorned the dais in
cream brocade trimmed with old lace, bands of
Trilby velvet in pansy shades and a snappy dia-
mond necklaoe—her daughter making her debut in
white siljc and lilies of the valley. Another suc-
cessful debutante was a daughter of the Presi-
dent’s, while the pretty daughters of a very active
member of the ball committee looked like a couple
of snow-flakes in white silk and satin gowns.
St. Vincent’s ball-committee made a huge suc-
cess of its ball, at Sydney Town Hall, on Wednes-
day, and set a good example for the coming charity-
ball season, besides providing an object-lesson m
unswerving energy in a singularly good cause.
The fine decorations had been handed down by
the Ag. ball-committee, and an excellent supper
downstairs, as w,ell as a perennial buffet in the
vestibule, gave people plenty to dance on. Two
new waltzes were played—Harry Hyndes’s musi-
cianly “ Mindaribba,” and “The Wisteria,” by a
Victorienne, both of which found favor at once
with waltzers, and the programme of dances was
judiciously arranged. Also, a novelty was’.a
f>almist, who told fortunes to the dense two-shil-
ing crowd in the three galleries, and who came
down to the ballroom later on.
The vice-regal party, sans Lady Hampden,
arrived by fits and starts —first of all the ladies,
headed-by Lady Brassey in amatronly gown of black
satin brocade glistening like a beetle, and enlivened
by pink roses on the corsage and jewels sparkling
here and there. Mrs. Freeman Thomas appeared
in pink and silver; Miss Buxton in pompadour
silk ; and the Misses Brand in white silk and blue
and white striped silk respectively, looking rather
more dashing than usual, Miss Alice Brand carry-
ing a very special committee posy that added
S’eatly to her ensemble. Gov. Hampden, with
aron Brassey and Gov. Buxton, arrived late, hot
from the A. J.C. dinner. These have been busy
times with the Great, who have gone faithfully
through the giddy Easter programme more like
machines than men. By the way, that report
from ’Ome about Lady H. being the better Gover-
nor of the two isn’t being verified in Sydney. Gov.
Hampden is a model Gov. as far as keeping his
engagements is concerned, while the occasions on
which her Ex. has defaulted already run into
dozens.
At St. Vincent’s ball, which was “ plain and
fancy,” the dressing went from the sublime to the
ridiculous. The large feminine committee was
carefully combed up. Mrs. Prendergast, for in-
stance, wore a white silk gown veiled in silvery
net, a cluster of red-and-black poppies on the
shoulder, and magnificent diamonds; Mrs. Slattery
(hon. treas.) was m pink and white chine silk and
lace and diamonds ; Miss Doyle (hon. sec.) in a
smart white silk gown with glittering crystal net
draping the bodice, and a snappy diamond star ;
Mrs. M. H. Stephen (vice-president) wore a good-
looking mixture of pansy brocade and velvet; and
a number of other nice frocks helped to soften the
effect of a colleen in pea-green cap-k-pie, and a
damsel in orange who looked rather out of place
at St. Vincent’s ball. Then a short, substantial
lady in a high - waisted white christening-
robe had evidently come as a baby, and the
ill-fated Marie Stuart (so-called, I suppose, because
of the people who stalk around at fancy balls in a
copy of her duds) did the ball-room with the last
mosquito-net of summer pinned to her back hair.
There was a good percentage of naval youths pre-
sent whom the Admiral had graciously allowed to
sport their tinsel—unlike a previous occasion when
they were all ordered forth in their plain clothes,
though the Ad. himself glittered all over like a
gold-stopped tooth. By the way, I can’t
say I liked the nautical slops of a great
Erench commander. Epaulettes and medals and
gold buttons I can forgive, but when it comes to
little gold anchors in each corner of the hero’s
coat-tails, the whole thing suggests a bon-bon.
Now that women have made the experiment of
attending the yearling-sales at Randwick, these
highly interesting functions will probably become
the fashionable thing to “do.” At the sale of
Duckenfield Park yearlings last week Mrs. ‘ ‘ Jack ”
Eales and a party of ladies were in evidence, being,
so far as I know, the first women to venture out to
Randwick under the circs., although it’s a regular
thing at ’Ome for fashionable women of a sporting
turn of mind to attend the Newmarket sales. And
no wonder. There are few things more exciting
than to hear the figures climbing over one another
while a baby thoroughbred goes romping round
the ring—and more especially when the hammer
is wielded by such a punctilious gentleman as the
A.J.C. secretary. A man who ought to know
says that the presence of ladies at these sales
would liven up the bidding—on the principle, I
suppose, that men like to look big when women
have their eyes on ’em ?
On dit that Lord Brassey for all his bonhammie
is, like the valet to the King of Barataria, a
rathdr touchy man. When the yachting M.L.C.
mistook the newly-painted Sunbeam “ for a col-
lier, by dad,” and said so at the club, it unfor-
tunately happened that Gov. Brassey was just
behind and heard all. Instead of diplomatically
passing it over and accepting the proffered ex-
planation, Gov. B. took it rather huffily, and rela-
tions were for a little while awkwardly strained
between His Ex. and the Sydney yachtsman.
Evidently the Sunbeam is Gov. Brassey’s tender
point.
The complimentary regatta to Gov. Brassey, on
Saturday, was a success to onlookers, for it was a
bright day on the water, even if the howling gale
played the fool with the race-card, and made it
impossible for whole fleets of sailing craft to enter
an appearance. But everybody who owned a
brass button went gadding about the harbor,
which really did look beautiful, with foam on
every wave, and as blue as a hilltop-novel. The
scene round the starting-point was very festive —
all the yachts with an overhead-gear of bunting,
and the trim-looking flagship apparently one mass
of people. Gov. Brassey, in a white, somewhat
cookified cap and a hard-bitten serge suit, was the
most simply-dressed yachter of them all, and paid
frequent visits to the genial commodore of the
P.A.Y.C., on board the trim White Star, in a
“ puffing Billy ” manned by businesslike seamen
in oilskins. Gov. Brassey’s water equipage is
meant to be taken very seriously indeed. There
was a vast amount of visiting between the big
yachts. On the Sunbeam, Lady Brassey (in
creamy serge) was “at home ” by invitation, and
had a long list of callers.
The Commodore’s steam yacht White Star was
in man-o’-war order from end to end, and easily
accommodated a large party, including a globe-
trotting baronet double-banked by a fox-terrier,
the Bishop of Sydney and his sister, and several
Melbournians. Miss Cowper (sister-in-law of the
host) was hostess, and wore a black silk gown with
fichu of cream chiffon and bonnet en suite, while
the Commodore sported the smart blue and gold
uniform of the P. A. Y.C. Sydney yachtsmen cer-
tainly do dress the part—there is absolutely no
fault to find with them from a wardrobey point of
view : and if the brass-button industry ever goes
under it won’t be the fault of the Yachting Club
rules and regulations. Lady Hampden, in a work-
manlike suit of black serge and a fawn felt infantry
hat and feather, lavender gloves, black-spot veil
and an ecru parasol with a polka dot, paid a visit
to the Commodore and took tea on board, going on
afterwards to the Sunbeam “at home” with a
party from the White Star. All the afternoon
there was nothing but visiting—the Bronzewing,
the Ena, the Iduna, and the Era, all having large
parties aboard.
The regatta itself was only half a regatta—but
it was infinitely more amusing than a postpone-
ment. There were plenty rowing events, and
those funny little copper punts, rigged to resemble
the warships they scrape the sides of on a work-
ing day, were the Eltons of the programme, and
made all the fun in the unavoidable absence of
the tub-race. By the way, I must compliment
yachting femininity on the way it turned out for
the Brassey regatta. The dressing was very neat.
One damsel in navy-blue, with a mate’s cap and
no petticoats on, cut a very attractive summer-
periodical-looking figure as she blew down the man-
o’-war-steps with the wind well behind her. Per-
haps the two pluckiest women at the regatta wore
navy blue serge, and adorned the yacht of a
Sydney medico which carried a reckless amount of
sail, and went gunwale-under in a shower of foam.
“ The Importance of Being Earnest went
up, to the delight of a large society audience, at
Sydney Criterion on Saturday, and got home a
the round green olive gets home in the midclie
stages of a feast. There was very dressing
in the trivial comedy. Miss Faber played Gwen
doline in two frocks, the chiefest of which vvas a
ribbon brocade in cream, blue and pink, with pale
blue silk sleeves to a dodgy bodme, and big black
hat with peeps of blue. Miss Faber was not
frothy enough to be convincing as the posm 0 , im-
possible Gwendoline who talks of the vibrations
in the name of Ernest, with clasped hands, and
is full of transcendental tommy-rot to the top
curl. Miss Faber would always be thrown away
in a part absolutely without sympathy or sincerity.
Pretty Miss Hardy was “lively m a grey
frock and white chiffon bib. Her song, home-
body told me so,” was very feelingly sung and
gained the encore it deserved. It was the one
touch of natural emotion in three acts, and the
audience, steeped in delightful and entertaining
cynicisms, grabbed at it and hung on to it as the
Rev. Chasuble said he would hang on the lips oi
Miss Prism. t
Jennie Watt-Tanner, as “ Lady Bracknell,
came on at first with some of the buttons of her
gorgeous purple silk and velvet frock undone at
the back —but buttons are a detail in the trivial
comedy, which is full of the brightest and best
pessimism in the modern market. One now and
then suspects the brilliant author of merely stand-
ing well-known sayingson thciroldbaldheads and
even then, if they become infinitely amusing that
way, and if nobody ever dreamt of reversing them
before, it must be accounted for originality on the
part of the man who first got the idea. It doesn t
seem a very clever thing, now, to eat a potato, but
the early man who stopped people from boiling
the tops and throwing the bulb away was
liant genius in his foggy, uncertain day. ‘‘ r lh e
Importance of Being Earnest ” is full of Wude-
isms, the smartest of which have been widely
quoted and so seem familiar; but some lovely
fresh sallies occur in the quarrel-scene between the
women, where the false gush of the Society female
over another of her kind quickly turns to its
native gall when the inevitable man comes along.
Gwen, who has had the best of the battle, rails at
the country : “I should be bored to death.’
“Yes,” retorts Cicely, the simple village maid;
“ that’s what the papers call agricultural depres-
sion.” So honors are easy.
The Governmentouse ball on Thursday may be
counted in as the usual brilliant spectacle which
it seems difficult for any vice-regal snivoo to avoid
being. Cosmeas were the mainstay of the hand-
some V.R. decorations, which is a fortunate
fashion for Guvmentouse to set, since the humble
but attractive flower grows like a weed for the
mere asking, and every woman who goes to
Guvmentouse and adopts its decorations can-
not always afford to have roses out of season
to trim her victuals with. I hear that, at the
Y.R. ball —where the hostess looked good form in
black and white and diamonds, and Lady Brassey
was a study in blue, with court plumes and glisten-
ing ornaments —a good many of the bedizened
guests tore themselves away before 11.30, so as
to catch last trams and things like that to their
distant happy homes. What sort of a chance
has poor cabby of keeping hoof-and-hide together
when people get home from gubernatorial halls of
dazzling light in twopenny tram-cars ?
Sydney Polo Club, under the patronage of the
Governor, holds one of its intensely interesting
sports meetings at the pretty Kensington course
on 28th inst. (Saturday). The fixture, which will
be attended by vice-royalty, is sure to attract a
fashionable gathering. By the way, Gov. Hamp-
den is a tremendous golfer. He goes forth in a
becoming soft felt hat and hits a ball over the flat
country between Bondi and Rose Bay. Fortu-
nately the uninitiated never suspect a golf course.
They think the red flags are surveyors’ marks, or
something to do with a sewer.
The enterprising Sydney photo, man, Eden,
indefatigable organiser of popular concerts, got up
a vast shilling concert at Sydney Town Hall on
Saturday to enable the majority to hear the culti-
vated warblingsateveof debonnair tenor Newbury
and Madame Spada and the members of their
concert co. The bill was fourteen items long, and
included “The Death of Nelsdn,” “Sing Sweet
Bird,” “Sunshine and Ram,” “Come into the
Garden, Maud.” You couldn’t have had a better
programme for a “pop.” Apropos of concerts,
clever little Maud M‘Carthy will visit Australia
next year, and give a series of 30 concerts.
Writes my Melb. correspondent
“ From the crown of her head to her ankles the
American impersonatress of Trilby is a bewilder-
ingly pretty girl. Miss Crane’s arms, wrists, and
hands have caused quite a little sensation on their
own account; and when, in the third act, the
actress appears gowned in a classic white silk robe
embroidered with gold, with her red-gold hair a-
hanging down her back almost to her knees, one
understands the infatuation of the whole of the
male cast of the play. In the book, Trilby is
given five admirers; in the play, she has all the
principals, with the supers, thrown in.
“Trilby begins her theatrical career in the grey
military coat and striped petticoat; and ends it
very much d la her favorite Marguerite Gautier
in a trailing peignoir of white silk, with wing
sleeves of white fine lace. She wears with this
gown a bunch of crimson roses, and works in a
snappy little effect at the death by spilling the
rose-leaves all over herself. On the dead white
th r y J°°u c ? ulte , ‘ b } u ogy,’ and the audience
tefels she has broken her heart in real earnest.
A/r <! nf% ]V f l adame . Vina rd, Jennie Reiffarth shows
Melb. folk a piece of acting of a quality they
have seldom tasted before. Will aspiring Austra-
lian actresses please note the exquisite manner in
which she uses her hands ? By artistic gesture
and movement she makes them as expressive as a
beautiful voice.
~ V ? ou IS a decidedly fascinating person, and
did he not bear the unmistakeably Yankee name
of Geo. H Trader, one would feel convinced he
was French, for he looks like a Jan Van Beers
come to life, and chatters the lingo and gesticulates
absolutely like a boulevardier. By the way, what a
scrumptious bicycling dress his Zouave uniform
would make !
“ Melb. Society rolled up in bare-busted splen-
dour to the performance of the ‘ Birds ’ of Aristo-
phanes at Ormond College. It was all in Greek ;
but as Society doesn t go to the play to under-
stand anything, that didn’t matter. However,
everyone "made desperate efforts to look learned,
and watched those who undoubtedly did, or were
supposed to know Greek; laughing when these
laughed, and applauding when they applauded.
Society at a Greek play is like a Protestant at a
Catholic mass—it takes its cue from the ways of
the majority. The consequence was that there
was more laughter and applause over the ‘ Birds ’
than at the Princess’s over, say, ‘ The Amazons’ or
‘ The Passport. ’
“ A calico ball is being organised in Melb. for
19th May in aid of the Austin Hospital for In-
curables. The committee has struck a brilliant
idea as regards the calico part of the entertain-
ment. Instead of requesting the guests to array
themselves in cotton garments, each is asked to
bring with her or him not less than two yards of
calico, to be used afterwards by the hospital
inmates. ”
Yours affectionately,

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Re the “one down, t’other come up’’perform
ances of Newhaven and Coil: these crack two-year-olds
are merely repeating the in-and-out form of many prede-
cessors tliat could be mentioned ; nevertheless, an expla-
nation is due from their respective owners, trainers, and
jockeys, also the public has a right to a full state-
ment of the explanation when it comes. In short, the
public ought to be informed that the starting of Newhaven
and Coil for any race is no guarantee of their fitness to
run, and that either horse is likely to prove 211b. better
than the other on any particular day. Assuming that
they are both of them honestly raced on their variable
merits -and Tiie Bulletin does assume it—there is no
other way of accounting for the unsatisfactory meetings
of Coil and Newhaven, as revealed by the calendar. The
explanation aforesaid would be officially accepted as
“ satisfactory,” inasmuch as there is no written turf law
forbidding an owner to start a popular favorite when the
animal doesn’t appear likely to gallop its best, nor any
regulation compelling a trainer to thoroughly understand
his business.
It makes no difference to cursing punters
whether the trainers of Coil and Newhaven don’t under-
stand their business and don’t know when to expect their
equine charges to run “ up to form,” or whether the
owners of Coil and Newhaven, being possessed always of
reliable information (as far as horseflesh can be reliable)
concerning the fitness or unfitness of their champions,
race them without the least regard for the Turf’s best in-
terests. Ikey Mo gets there all the same, whichever of
these two satisfactory explanations may be the right one.
Yet the public would be spared a lot of unnecessary grief
if a definite understanding of the case were arrived at.
The sport of horse-racing, as we have it in Australia,
comes from England, and The Bulletin can’t be too per-
sistent in mentioning that a Coil-ctt/n-Newhaven state of
affairs wouldn’t appear satisfactory to reputable owners
in England, where crack two-year old form is proverbially
true and consistent. Out here it seems to follow the rule
of see saw, and some light on the subject would give the
Gentiles a chance to see the folly of putting faith in the
“ book.”
* * * *
The A. J.C. Easter Stakes running was so inex-
plicable that it is no wonder that inquiry was called for.
Coil and Newhaven don't appear to be a pair of in-and-
outers, but that something was radically wrong was
evident. Newhaven, with 9.7, won in the commonest of
canters in 3.16—hot time for a canter—while Coil, his
Champagne victor, finished ignobly in the rear. It was a
notorious reversal in both cases, but the public, who
knew they were picking up money laying odds on New-
haven in the Champagne, viewed it from this standpoint
only, and hooted accordingly.
Coil and Newhaven each appear to have certain
days off from turf duty. Coil won V.R.C. Sires Produce
Stakes, but let Newhaven have a turn in Ascot Vale
Stakes. In the A. J.C. Champagne it was Coil’s day, and
in the Easter Stakes it was Newhaveu’s “shift.” An
extraordinary pair, truly. In all their races both have
won easily. Now, which is the better horse?
Courallie’s owners were not over-satisfied with
J. A. Delaney’s riding in the All Aged. He was kept too
far back to catch Delaware in the home run. But what
price the despised M.L. youngster Tire, who dashed past
the pair and won with ease in 1.40-1 —half a second under
the record. That brilliant run from the beaten ruck
confirms the writer’s idea that he will blossom into another
Tirailleur. This horse downed all opposition in M.L..
but was heavily weighted in Australia until Glenloth’s
year. That race was a certainty for him on track-form
with Glenloth, but he got killed.
The pride of St. Albans’ is essentially a “gallery ”
horse, winning or dead-heating in the last few strides
He makes hard work of all his races, and in Cumberland
Stakes only managed victory by a neck. Like Cabin
Boy, the improved Valiant made him go all he knew in
the straight, and his backers weren’t comfortable until he
got alongside the son of Antaeus, who shaped much
better than in S. Cup.
Gough says he has to be in perfect condition to
get Wallace home in his hard tussles. The sluggard won’t
gallop unless he’s thrashed. “ The only way to make him
gee would be to have an electric battery attached to the
spurs.”
A peculiar thing about the All-aged Mile was
that Courallie carried 51b. less than in the Doncaster.
the time was the same, and he could only just place him
self. Even under the most favorable circs, it is probable
that he couldn’t have beaten Tird, who passed him as
though standing still. Delaware, too, is a brilliant miler,
be it remembered, and won the Doncaster last year.
The Harvester ran a most respectable third in
the Cumberland, and would have been much closer hail
he not lost his position at the sheds. He is by no meani
a back-number yet, but isn’t well-conditioned. Toreador
didn’t run up to form. In fact, nothing appeared to run
up to form during the day, bar Wallace.
It was a mistaken notion keeping Cabin Boy in
the rear on the waiting principle in Cumberland Stakes
He tired himself struggling for his head, and when the
field moved he couldn’t go faster. Pace-making is the
youngster’s forte, and he can pace, too. Even if sent
along to the front, he couldn’t have shaped worse than hf
did—last.
The public ought to show profound respect for
Gough’s whip, which has pulled them out of the mud od
many occasions. If ever he happens to drop that whip in
a race, they’ll have to part to the ring, for Wallace will
never win under mere hand and heel persuasion.
* * » »
His Deckcellency Gov. Brassey was staggered
at the well-dressed paddock habitues hooting and yellitrg
over Newhaven’s display. He asked Gov. Hampden il
that was “ the usual thing.” Mr. Guvment’ouse, valiantlv
standing to his “ loyal subjects,” remarked, “ Perhapi
they have cause for it.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Th e R.C Plenary Council of Australasia
made a big blunder in issuing its invective against
secular education just before the Queensland elec-
tions. Ihe results from the standpoint of Denomi-
national Education have been simply calamitous.
H. : “ Who can say Britain is ruled by
the People ? Even admitting Parliament repre-
sents the nation, how has it been consulted over
this Dongola business ? The fact is Salisbury and
Chamberlaip do just what they like.”
At Mackay (Q.) election 235 votes, which
were expected to change the result of the poll by
ousting a Govt, candidate, were thrown out as in-
formal, because the returning-officer initialled the
front of the ballot-papers instead of the back,
a he possible uses of a system like this are obvious.
The first blow in the Maoriland election
Oftinpaign was struck a few days ago, when an
enthusiastic elector rang the bell of ex-M.L.A.
Henry .Smith h ish, and landed him an awful
whack in the eye as soon as he came out. The
first nose-blood of the battle is, therefore, on
Fish s doorstep.
Minister Gould, on his own account, is
using his spare time codifying the N.S.W. jury
laws ; Premier Reid is going carefully through the
Criminal Code ; and other Ministers are nursing
little things of their own. Hence Chief Justice
parley’s retirement and the general cave-in of the
Law Consolidation Commission.
At an early stage, Mr. “Tom” Slattery’s
in-and-out and round-about reasoning re the
validity of the existing N.S.W. Land and Income-
tax assessment measure stirred several would-be
interveners, but a remembrance of Colin M‘Kay
Smith s relators hip in the expensive payment-of-
members question pulled them back into a state of
holy quiet.
The problem with which the N.S.W. bush
settler is now wrestling is something like this : If
a man buys land from the Govt, at £1 an acre, and
expends labor equal to £2 an acre on the necessary
improvement of clearing, and lays out, say, 10s.
an acre on fencing, and his crops are a dead
failure, and his cow is dead, and his fence is burnt
by bush fires, and the tank, which cost =£3o worth
of hard work to excavate, is dry, and the selling
price of the whole place is now only 18s. an acre -
what is the unimproved value?
Chamberlain re-
fuses to help Q-
Central Separation-
ists, and suggests
that Australian Fe-
deration should
come first. No better
answer could have
been expected. Both
Central and N orth-
«m Queensland have
a strong case for
separation from the
South —which takes
advantage of its
over-whelming jrar-
liainentary prejion-
derance to system-
atically disregard
their interests and
milk their revenues.
But this time the
case was not pro-
perly presented. No
attempt was made
to show—by polling
heads or obtaining
expressions of re-
presentativeopinion
—that the people
were really behind
the movement. The
statistics were few
and vague; and
there was a super-
abundance of rhe-
toric —which proves
nothing. The agi-
tation was perm lt-
ted to look like the
agitation of a little
Rockhampton
clique; and the
result was the na-
tural result under
the circumstances.
The real truth
underlying the ru-
mors about the con-
templated retire-
ment of Duncan Gillies fw*u Via tolfti-
Generalship is that some of his oid poht
cal associates wrote him su
would be useful to his party in just
now. The helpless incompetence of the bebaublexl
MTntyre, as Opposition leader, tills the V c. l
with despair. But Duncan G. knows when he s
comfortable. A flea in the back of a fat dog
not more happy than Gillies in a sinecu .

discredit thrown on the Labor candidate about
a week before the election. Nicely timed.
H. H. Champion, it is alleged, is going to
contest the Villiers and Heytesbury seat in Vic.
Assembly. Pity he doesn’t save himself for next
September, and run against Sargood for the
Council. The Assembly is reasonably Demo-
cratic already, and it is only wasting a good
Democrat to put him there when the Council
needs him so badly.
Henry Lucy, S.M. Herald’s London corres-
pondent, has changed his opinion about Chamber-
lain since the Jameson episode. Just after the
elections he foresaw that Birmingham Joe would
ride the high horse to his ruin; his permanent
acceptance by the Tories was impossible. Now,
‘ Dizzy’s ” career may open to him. Lucy is a
better Liberal partisan than he is a political critic.
Cabled that American cruisers are assem-
bling in Turkish waters. The English, with 300
odd of the best fighting ships afloat, have been
unable to coerce Turkey, except at the prospective
cost of a general European war. It remains to be
seen what Turkey and her protector Russia will
say to the danger of obliteration by the U.S. and
her formidable fleet of 45 cruisers, gunboats, &c.,
all told.
The Bulletin begins to dream of a time
when there will be an Age-of-Consent party in
Australian politics, in addition to the Tory, Demo-
cratic, Labor, Single-Tax, Land-Tax, Retrench-
ment, Cold Tea, Freetrade, Protectionist, Revenue-
tariff, Bible-in-Schools, Yellow Pup, Holy Roman,
and National Ass parties. And the Age-of-Consent
party promises to be the most unpleasant of the
lot.
The Clarion, on the franchise in Vic-
toria :
The colony ol Victoria has adopted the principle of
“one adult one vote,” and the women of Victoria will
henceforth vote in parliamentary elections.
Victoria “ has adopted the principle,” but the
House of Rich Landlords blocks the way. No
doubt, too, the women of Victoria will “ hence-
forth. ” But whenforth ?
Some prominent S.A. National Ass candi-
dates, when closely questioned as to the meaning
of the words “ employing suitable labor ” in the
Northern Territory, included in the Ass policy,
have explained that “suitable labor” does not
necessarily mean other than white labor. This, of
course, is but a clumsy attempt to deliberately
deceive. What the Ass wants is cheap alien labor
and nothing else. If it meant white labor it would
say so, and not needlessly alienate voters.
Under the original Federation Bill, as pre-
sented to Vic. Parliament, after the Federal Con-
stitution was agreed upon it was to be submitted
to a popular vote, when a majority would decide
whether Victoria should federate or not, and even
if there was a majority in favor the vote was to be
null and void unless 50,000 electors were in the
affirmative. The Upper House gently changed
the 50,000 to 75,000, and now it is a matter for
serious thought whether 75,000 electors can be
induced to worry about the matter one way or
another. Vic. Council evidently thinks not,
which accounts for the fluid deposited inside the
cocoa-nut.
THE SOLITARY.
X47: “ I found the prisoner sitting on a doorsh'ep in College-street, yer
Wortship, at half-pasht three this morning”
“ Was he alone? ”
X47: “He was, yer Wortship !”
“ How do you know ?”
X47: “ Release I was with him, yer Wortship !”
Melb. Argus disgustedly points out that
Kingston and his colleagues in S.A. have not had
to face a single want-of-confidence motion m the
House. Truly a degrading state of things. When
it is admitted'that Ministries go into power merely
to conduct business, and not to figure m a series of
wild and useless “scraps” with the other fellows,
all the light and color and interest will be wiped
out of Parliamentary life, and gentlemen of con-
servative instincts will prefer to give their patron-
age to the p.r. or the rat-pit.
The absentee-tax, carried by the Kingston
Govt, to the accompaniment of Tory howls and
prophesies of national disaster, realised only
d;3600 last year ! According to opposition press
fables, hundreds of thousands of pounds were
“ withdrawn ” from S.A. owing to this iniquitous
tax !
NA UTICA L OPINION.
JACK: “ Well, blow me tight if that ain’t the smallest funeral
ever I see’d!”
Gem of S.A. Tory eloquence :
Mr. Kingston was always associated with humbug, in-
tolerance, and autocracy,' and the skin of his carcase hid
one of the worst livers ever known. He also committed
bigamy by marrying every reform that came along, then
murdered them by this forcible espousal, and cemented
them under the hearth of his policy to be unearthed by
the Labor party. Therefore, Mr. Kingston must not ob-
ject to being referred to as the “ political Deeming.”
“ Murdered them by this forcible espousal ” is
good. Even Deeming waited a bit.
Sydney Telegraph: “The Labor-party
. . . stood solidly behind Mr. Reid in his en-
deavor to take some of the burdens off the working
masses, and make wealth and privilege contribute
its share to the public revenue.” Which means,
The Bulletin presumes, that the Labor-party
stood solidly behind Mr. Reid in taking the duties
off pianos, Brussels carpet, jewellery, tapestry art
squares, precious stones, four and six button
gloves, surah silk, marble clocks, American bottled
fruits ’and tinned turkey. This is what is really
meant by “taking the burdens off the working
masses.” 11 Aint it sickenin ?
During the last two or three weeks the
N.S.W. Govt, has steadily eaten and drunk its
way right through Northern N.S.W. Pity that
the daily press, which said so much about the
hard eating and drinking of the Dibbs Ministry,
doesn’t start to remonstrate. Its fetish, who is
short and stout and takes no exercise, and is too
much addicted to sweet stuff, can’t stand this sort
of thing. Dibbs was long and lathy and always
in fighting condition, and could digest a tenpenny
nail on the shortest notice, and banquets only
made him appoint his friends to good billets more
vigorously &ncl damn a littlo harder, but Cr. xi.
Reid is built of softer material, and a few more
banquets will leave him a green and bilious wreck.
The Income-tax promises to prove a
ghastly disappointment so far as concerns the
N S.W. country districts-if one case Ihe Bulle-
tin has heard of is anything like a fair sample.
In a certain rather prosperous township the local
lawyer has, for some time, averaged ,£4O a week
for filling up Land and Income-tax schedules, and,
through much ingenuity and a patient study of the
Act he reckons that he has done the Guv ment
out of =£9oo taxation for that district alone.
Also he reckons that all his schedules will hold
water, and that his clients-most of whom cant
be bowled out by their books for they haven t got
any—will stand any examination if they only re-
member his instructions. One of his inventions
is a new and complete method of proving that the
land thereabouts is practically worthless. Said
lawyer is now refreshing himself with drink after
his labors, which is how some of these things have
leaked out.
A sign of the times in the direction of the
practical abolition of one form of sweating is the
proposal at the M.L. Trades and Labor confer-
ence for the establishment of a State tailoring
workshop. As a proposal equally worthy of atten-
tion, the establishment of State bakeries might be
added.
S.M. Herald’s London
correspondent comments on
the curious fact that the Ash-
antee expedition, perfectly suc-
cessful at the least possiblecost,
was hardly noticed by the pub-
lic ; while Dr. Jameson, who
blundered stupidly into an
enemy’s country, did no fight-
ing worth speaking of, and
was forced to an inglorious
surrender, became a popular
hero. ‘ ‘ There is a saying grow-
ing up in the army, ‘No
muddle, no medal.’ ”
The projected great Aus-
tralian Northern Territory
Chartered Co. seems to have
fizzled down to an Anglo-
French co. ? with a capital of
half a million (not at all likely
to be subscribed), writes The
Bulletin’s London corres [on-
dent. The moving spirit in
the scheme appears to be a
not - over - wealthy lordling,
named Norreys, who is nomi-
nal vendor of the huge tract
to be acquired—with him is
associated Lord Kilmorey, who
was in Australia with Duke
Alfred.
Q. electors mostly treat
their contingent votes as
strange beasts to which it is
better to give a wide berth.
In the S. Brisbane election,
for example, out of a total of
4,600 votes polled, only 86
were contingent. The system
has therefore had no influence
whatever on the results of the
first batch of elections. It was
originally devised to oust the
horrid Labor man who slipped
in between two Govt, candi-
dates, and applies the basic
principle unjustly enough. So
far, its only achievement has
been the dismissal of ex-Minea
Minister Ilodgkinson to float
co’s in Westralia.
If the Liberals have their
way at next election, there will
be in Maoriland no Japanese,
no private friendly societies, no
distraint for rent, no exorbi-
tant rate of interest, no C.D.
Act, no (legally) unprotected
young girls, no starvation
wage, no excessive boy or girl
labor, no unsupervised clubs,
and (if the people so decide) no liquor. Then there
are to be workmen’s villages, State fire-insurance,
and the audit of public companies’ accounts.
The number of sheep in N.S.W., which
reached the maximum of 61,831,000 in 1891, was
at the end of 1895 only 47,333,000. The decrease
during the 1895 drought is set down at a little
over 10,000,000. The awful luck of ex-Premier ■
Dibbs glares forth conspicuously in these figures.
Dibbs’ protective tariff lasted from the end of ’9l
to the end of ’95. There were four consecutive
good seasons up to the end of ’9l, and in these
four years the increase was over 15,000,000 sheep.
Then, in the four years covered by the Dibbs
tariff, there were two droughts and a decrease of
14,000,000 sheep, so that the protective era came
out 29,000,000 sheep worse than the previous four
years of Foreign-trade. People judge a policy by
the good or bad luck which goes with it, and if it
doesn’t rain in N.S.W. under a protective tariff
then that tariff is bound to go down.
Premier Reid kindly assures the N.S.W.
sugar-planters that when their industry is de-
stroyed by Freetrade they can “ take to something
else,” and suggests dairying. In other words,
they are to root out their cane crops, and sow
grasses, and wait a year or two for them to grow,
and buy cows, and build creameries, and get the
money to do all these things from no place in par-
ticular, and live on nothing in the meantime. The
advice is so affably heartless that The Bulletin
is filled with a great yearning to see G. Reid try-
ing something else also. It would like to throw
open the legal profession to all comets who could
pass an examination, in which case it would be so
swamped that G.H.R. wouldn’t make salt at it.
And then it would tell the distressed old man of
vast circumference to take to something else —
watchmaking or electrical engineering, for in-
stance, or perhaps navigation ; any small thing
that an old man who knew nothing about it could
naturally make a living at right off without the
smallest difficulty.
When Federation arrives, and there are
no border tariffs, and railways and roads are built
to carry produce to the nearest port, wherever it
may be, instead of to the ports of one particular
province, however remote and inconvenient they
may be, Port Augusta should start on a career
that will ultimately make it almost, if not quite,
the greatest seaport in Australia. It lies at the
head of a gulf which extends nearly 200 miles in-
land ; therefore it is so much nearer to the centre
of the continent than such coastal cities as Sydney.
It is the nearest port for all S.A., for all N.S.
Wales west of the Darling and the Paroo, and for
a great part of S.W. Queensland —only the traffio
from these places has been carefully kept away
from it by the want of connecting railways and
good roads, and diverted to Sydney and Brisbane.
Also, it is 1000 miles nearer Europe by sea than
either of them. Port Augusta, with its 757 people
and its one newspaper and its lonesome gaol, is the
natural outlet for a larger extent of territory than
any other place on the Australian coast, and its
depressed state is a lamentable example of how
provincial legislators have insisted on dragging
trade to their own cities, regardless of distance
and expense and all other considerations.

government might buy the
MILLS.
According to a local paper there was half a
million invested in these mills. Why should
not the company, with its half-million invested
in plant, which would be ruined if the indus-
try was ruined, say to the farmers : “ We will
bear Is. of that 2s. reduction.” (Great cheer-
ing.) If the company would not do that, per-
haps they would sell those magnificent mills
at a sacrifice.
Mr. Reid said that if they went to Queensland U
they would have to meet the black labor, and in
Queensland there was four times more sugar pro-
duced than the people could eat, and they had,
therefore, to sell in other countries. If they could
not live here, what could they do there ?
Mr. Barry: Then we will have to go into the
unemployed here.
Mr. Reid : I will make you work.
Mr. Barry: Then give us something more pro-
fitable than sand-shifting. Our industry is being
sacrificed to a principle.
the FUTURE OF THE N.B.W. SUGAR INDUSTRY UNDER FREETRADE.
Tt £ whu:h drew tbe buggy containing the Daily Telegraph representative, and Mr.
John Reid, succeeded in breaking the reins. The reins were quickly mended, but soon after the
plunging horses smashed their harness badly, and while Mr. Renwick and the other occupants were
endeavoring to get the horses clear, they lost sight of the procession. (The D.T. has indeed lost sight
of the procession.) °
We cannot imagine any section of the community which will gather much satisfaction from
the Pr ® m jer’e Northern tour. It can hardly be gratifying to th-: Freetrade party to find their
accepted leader coquetting with transparent Protectionist expedients as State bonuses and Stata
subsidised sugar mills. "—From Sydney Daily Telegraph, April 13.

In Cosmos for March, G. B. Barton, who
used to have a critical reputation, brackets Pater-

Poets ”! ! ! Same old story :
W. L. Patison left the firm of Far-
leigh, Nettheim & Co., Sydney, leather merchants
and bootmakers, after a service of 10 years, and
joined the clergy department of the local Congre-
gational Church a week or two ago. As two
Australian bishops and several curates worked for
a while at bootmaking in the old land, it would
seem that there is a comparatively easy transition
from soles to—well, that’s not hard, anyway.
The poet Neild, in his recent platform on-
slaught upon rival bards and the newspaper critics,
was understood to infer that some paper or other
had indicated readiness to take =£2o in exchange
for a “ good notice ”of his book. Mr. Neild, if he
did say or insinuate such a thing (The Bulletin
was not directly represented at his oration), owes
it to the community to mention the name of the
paper whose opinion is for sale on such moderate
terms.
Queen Victoria’s letter, on the death of
Prince Battenberg, reprinted in all colonial
Gazettes, concludes with thanks “for the appre-
ciation manifested of the dear and excellent prince
who lay down his life in the service of his
country.” Confusion of the parts of the verbs “to
lay ” and “ to lie ” is a royal weakness, as witness
the historical advice given by the Prince of Wales
to Lady Mordaunt to lay up when she had the
measles.
The flowers which Mrs. Goodenough, by
the hands of Admiral Bridge, laid on her husband’s
grave in North Shore cemetery last week, recall
the fact that it is now over 20 years since the

coincidence, the Naval Home, erected to his honor
in Sydney, was never so crowded with “ tars ” as
during the past fortnight, fully 350 occupying the

T. P. Pugh, of Pugh’s Almanac, died at

Press, Moreton Bay Courier (now Brisbane
Courier), and Brisbane Telegraph ; and was a
foremost figure in the agitation for the separation
of the Northern province from N.S. Wales. From
’63 to ’6B he sat in Parliament as a representative
of North Brisbane ; and during the 15 years ended
1870 did valuable work in moulding opinion and
shaping institutions. Then came money embar-
rassments and health failure, and he gradually
faded out of notice. A minor police-magistrate’s
office was provided for him, which he held with
credit till his death. Few Australian pioneers of
thought have done better service in their day and
generation.
The late J. B. Patterson, speaking at
Castlemaine in the seventies on , th ® I^i^reclots
said: “The land must be made to perspire clots
of void.” A different being was the bir -lames
of the nineties who “ did ” Coll ins-street ,n a frock-
coat and spats up to a week before his death.
Francis Woodward, an ™
sentenced the other day at Wollongong (N.S.W )
to three years’ gaol for premed'tated short.iKe in
the trust-money. The Gent One is havm 0
of bad luck of late. Right up to a year ago it was
understood that the worst thing which could
happen to the fraudulent solicitor was removal
from the rolls, and now he goes to gaol almost like
any ordinary person, except when he is let our,
under the First Offenders Act.
A good many people have been waiting to
hear of the summary discharge of Alfred Austin
from the Laureateship, for his alleged poem in
which he glorified the buccaneering Jameson for
making war on a friendly State, and practically
sooled on other people to go and do likewise. The
Laureate is a semi-official person, with a salary
paid out of the public revenue, and the spectacle
of Austin being paid by the Government to glorify
law-breaking and filibustering, while the same
Government is prosecuting the law-breaker at
Bow-street, is a fine piece of hypocrisy.
Maoriland law, the other day, tried in a
slow and feeble way to set a great wrong partly
right by the release of Nils Jacobsen. Jacobsen
was found guilty in 1887 of a murder committed at
Little River, being convicted almost entirely on
the evidence of one Anders Nyman. The murder
was proved by abundance of independent evi-
dence, including the corpse, but only Jacobsen,
Nyman and the deceased were present when it
•was committed—if Jacobsen was really present,
which is doubtful—and Nyman apparently got his
swear in first. Jacobsen was sentenced to penal
servitude for life. Then Nyman, by a curious
accident, was nearly being hanged in New York
for a crime he didn’t commit, and in an outbreak
of conscience or hysterics he swore an affidavit
that he was the real author of the Little River
murder. After that Maoriland justice enquired into
the matter gradually for five years, and having
proved the confession to be authentic it released
Jacobsen when it got fully rested.
There enlisted in the first Vie. Artillery
Corps, in the early seventies, a magnificent picture
of physical perfection—one Terence O’Dwyer,
fresh from the County Clare, 6ft. sin. in his stock-
ings, and as shapely as a Greek god. On the oc-
casion of Terence’s first guard at Govt. House, the
great white-elephant-eyesore on the Domain wag
unfinished, and “ the Bowens ” were temporarily
fixed at Bishopcourt, E. Melb. The corporal of
the guard had posted his new sentry, and carefully
read over to him and explained the routine orders
from the board in the sentry-box. Then came a
verbal injunction: “There’s a tame wallaby in
the grounds ; be careful he doesn’t nip out through
the gates —he sometimes tries.” What a wallaby
was, Terence speculated as he marched briskly to
and fro in the broiling sun. It was the last of four
consecutive days of intense heat, every door and
window was wide open in expectation of a change
—which suddenly came, like a very fury, accom-
panied by clouds of dust. The wild south wind tore
into Bishopcourt, bangingblindsand window-sashes
and whirling flimsy draperies about the rooms. In
the drawing-room a light cushion-covering of deli-
cate lace was violently whisked around the apart-
ment, and finally it flew out of the window. Lady
Bowen, who had witnessed this, called excitedly
to the placid A.D.C., “Oh, Major Pitt, do try
and recover that antimacassar ; it was my mother’s
own work.” The gallant major hurried out and
vainly searched the grounds. It occurred to him
to question the sentry. As he approached, Ter-
ence, with the assistance of his carbine, had
assumed a paralytic attitude, which might have
been recognised as a caricature of a “ present ”
(arms). “ Haw ! sentry,” drawled the A.D.C.,
“did you see an antimacassar fly through the
gate?” Terence’s face was lit up with an apolo-
getic and deprecatory smile as he replied, “ Oh,
the ‘Macasser.’ Shure the divil himself wouldn’t
shtop thim ‘Macassers.’ He wint past me wit
tree leps, and away into the gyardens foreninst
before I could shtur a shtep to shtop’im.” Ter-
ence, has since learnt the difference between a
wallaby and an antimacassar.
There was once in N.S.W. a judge noto-
riously fond of the fair sex. A case was tried
before him in which the plaintiff was an exceed-
ingly pretty woman—so pretty that defendant’s
counsel hardly attempted to directly win the case,
but contented himself with reserving numerous
points for appeal. However, he did not get his
appeal; for, when the judge’s notes were seen,
they were found to contain nothing more than the
name of the pretty plaintiff—and her address.
Rev. Zillman, a German-Australian parson
located in Western Victoria, and four years ago
one of the chaplains at the Tombs prison, New
York, proposes to start a labor-church m Mel-
bourne, on the lines of the new English labor-
church. Mr. Zillman is a tall, clean-shaven, grey-
haired, much-married cleric who is generally at
loggerheads with his official superiors, and has had
quite a Bohemian career. He has dabbled much
in printers’ ink, and for a short time edited
Toowoomba (Q.) Gazette.
According to the report of the Lormer
Board, the enthusiastic teetotaller who instituted
the proceedings comes under the legal definition
of a lunatic. The law recognises as insane any-
body who can’t distinguish right from wrong.
Judge Williams and Co. now state that Lormer
had a distinct bias against the liquor-trade,
and though he adjudicated with such bias, he
did not know he possessed it, and considered he
was acting rightly. Which is another way of say-
ing that Lormer did not know right from wrong
and that he is a legal lunatic.
An Australian lawyer-politician, who had
enjoyed himself in the amorous East, was, on his
return, consulted by a well-known cleric concern-
ing Japan —what sort of a place, he asked, was it
to spend a holiday in ? For answer he received a
glowing description of the wonders and delights of
the land of the Mikado. “But tell me,” inter-
rupted the clergyman, “is it the sort of place I
could take my wife to?” “ Well,” replied the big
man, “I suppose you could take your wife there—
if you wanted to. But, look here, you wouldn’t
take a ham-sandwich to a Lord Mayor’s banquet,
would you ? ”
Ballarat East’s chief exhibit is “ Bill ”
Green, Vic.’s oldest identity, who has spent 58 out
of his 80 years in that province. This hale old
party anchored in Port Phillip, per Royal George,
m ’3B, when Sewerville counted lialf-a-dozen pubs,
and churches and a stray theatre (J. T. Smith’s).
Green was in the rally of Western district station-
hands that ‘ ‘ dispersed ” 300 Mount Shadwell
blacks for spearing sheep. For this the station
managers were indicted, but acquitted. Green
recollects the stocks that from ’4l to ’45 stood on
the site of Melb.’s Custom-house, and he passed
over Ballarat in ’39, when the Golden City was
unthought of.
Vic. Justice Hodges, the other day, gave a
young man four years for stealing two umbrellas.
Prisoner had three larceny sentences already re-
corded against him. Those in court were of
opinion that perhaps half of this extraordinary
penalty was due, though no doubt his Honor was
quite unconscious of the fact, to the circumstance
that this youth corrected the Judge on a point of
logic. “You have a very serious record,” said
Mr. Hodges. “ This is the fourth time you have
been found guilty of larceny.” “Yes,” came
from the dock, “and I have suffered for that.”
Then the Judge jerked out “Four years,” and
the prisoner was hustled from the dock.
Mr. J. C. WILLIAMSON.
Photo, by Talma, Melbourne,
Purves, Q.C., is not likely to conduct the
prosecution of another Melbourne journal in a
sporting-libel case, or any other sort of libel-case
wherein the defendant-layman fights personally
for his own hand. The legal theory that Cham-
pion didn’t know enough law to withstand the
furious onslaught of plaintiff O’Halloran and his
counsel was made to look very foolish when the
pair of professionals retired with their tails between
their legs. Inasmuch as Champion wasn’t a lawyer,
and didn’t care what he said about the men who
were posing as specimens of turf-purity, he had a
soft thing on. He couldn’t have got any hired
counsel to strike terror into the hearts of two mem-
bers of the shark-persuasion. Not much. Dog
sometimes bites dog, but it rarely or never eats
dog.
The first Australian burying-ground was
on the site of the present Sydney Town Hall. A
Sydney Gazette of 1804 contained a proposition
to fence in the ground, in consequence of the pigs
rooting up the earth and graves.
The other day N.S.W. Solicitor-General
Reid actually filed a bill against a couple of men
who had given a bill-of-sale over a crop which
had not actually then been sown and who had
sold that crop when it was procured. As was
pointed out by Crown-Prosecutor Wise, the Act
made no provisions for lien over anything which
did not exist. '

REPORT and BALANCE - SHEET presented at the Twenty-fifth Annual Meeting of the Members, held at the Society’s Offices, 406 Collins Street, Melbourne, on Monday, the 30th
March, 1896, at 4 o’clock p.m.
THE directors have the pleasure to present to the
account and balance-sheet, for the year ending De'
During that period there were received
; jmbers their annual report, with revenue
iiiber 31,1895.
2301 proposals to assure
of which 557 are in course of completion, or were wiiV av. u or decided for
and proposals were reduced to the extent of
... .£423,010
.£118,750
4,500
123,250
leaving 1474 proposals accepted and completed for jG3OO 360
add 59 proposals received in 1894, for which policies were issued in 1895 ... ... 12ffi00
Total 1533 policies issued in 1895, assuring ... ... _ £312 960
yielding an annual revenue of £10,094 ss. 2d. Oi this amount £3OOO was reassured with other offices
at a yearly premium of £B6.
The new business for 1895 was greater than that for 1894 by 121 policies, assuring £28,740 ; and
the annual premiums therefrom were greater by £B6O 7s. 2d.
114 claims occurred during the year, under 117 policies, to the amount of £32,275, which is
considerably less than the amount expected under the mortality table in use for valuation purposes.
The claims have decreased year by year since 1890, when they amounted to £45,371 11s. lid.
The total income for the year was £155,387 4s. 7d.
The interest earned for the year was more than sufficient to pay all claims and bonuses.
The expenses show an increase of only £ll2 18s. Bd. over those for 1894, although the new business,
which is responsible for the greater portion of the total, produces, as above mentioned, an addition of
£B6O 7s. 2d. to the income.
As the fifth quinquennial investigation, as at the close of the year, was in progress, the directors
made a special investigation of the assets. The society’s premises were revalued on the basis of present
net rentals, and in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Launceston, and Auckland, it was decided to write
off £56,242 12s. r >d. In Adelaide and Dunedin no change was made.
The properties which had fallen into the society’s hands and had either been foreclosed upon oi
were simply in the society’s possession as mortgagee were subjected to a most careful scrutiny, both at
head office and at branches. With few exceptions they also were valued on a neb rental basis, and
=£22,522 14s. sd. decided to be written off. Out of the profits of the quinquennium, a further sum will
be transferred to the credit of the investment fluctuation fund account to provide for any possible
depreciation in the whole of the securities, as specified in clause 76 of the articles of association.
The funds at the close of the year amounted to =£865,872 7s. Id., as compared with £662,761 Is. 6d.
at the close of 1890, showing an increase for the five years of £203,111 ss. 7d.
The directors wish to point out that the average rate of interest earned on the funds, invested and
uninvested, was £5 Is. lOd. per cent. ; that when a security falls into the society’s hands, or is believed
to be doubtful, no interest nor rent is taken credit for unless actually received ; and that the small
amount of outstanding interest in the balance-sheet, the greater portion of which has since been paid,
is an evidence of the soundness of the securities. Attention is drawn to the auditor’s certificate in
this respect.
The usual actuarial investigation of the liabilities of the society has been made, and the results are
reported to you separately.
The two directors who retire at this meeting, in terms of the articles of association, are the Hon.
Thomas Loader and Dr. Alexander Morrison. They are eligible for re-election, and have given notice
of their intention to offer themselves accordingly. (Note. —Since the report was issued, the Hon.
Thomas Loader has withdrawn his candidature, and will not offer himself for re-election.)
The directors have to report with deep regret the death of Mr. Caleb Peacock, chairman of the
Adelaide local board, and of Mr. D. B. Cruicltshank, of Auckland, both of whom were appointed at
the opening of these branches in 1879 and 1883 respectively, and have rendered valuable service to the
society. Neither vacancy has been filled.
The auditors, Messrs. A. W. Cleveland and C. M. Holmes, also retire in terms of the articles of
association, and have given notice of their intention to offer themselves for re-election.

Wp have examined the books accounts and securities of the Mutual Assurance Society of Victoria, Limited, at Melbourne (the statement of accounts from the branches, duly certified by the local auditors, have been correctly
ineomorated in the Head Office books) and certify that in our opinion, the above balance-sheet is a full and fair balance-sheet, containing the particulars required by the regulations of the society. W e find the majority of the
mnrtmure securities to be in excellent order payments of interest being regularly made, and that a fair amount has been written off the society’s premises, foreclosed properties, and properties in possession of the society as mortgagee ,
mortgage securities to be in excelientoraer, payments oi m J deem ’ uffioienti out of the surp i us 0 f the quinquennium, as a special reserve to meet any possible depreciation in the investments generally, as provided
we are also informed that the directors will set apart an amount which they may
in clause 76 of the articles of association.

One of the objects of the lately-appointed

Board, “ the appointment of an expert in London

Considering that N.S.W. spends about £300,000

in touch with its own timber and to teach the

Australian Centenarian.
101 YEARS OF AGE.
HOW SHE PROLONGED HER YEARS.
We doubt if but few care to grow old. There is a
dread about losing one’s strength, eyesight and
hearing, and a fear of becoming a burden to one’s
friends.
One of the oldest—if not the oldest—Australians
has an important secret to divulge which illus-
trates that the trials of old age can be delayed, so
that when the years do creep on apace, one can
grow old gracefully, and as long as life endures
have a fair measure of.physical strength.
Mrs. O’Rjgan, of 4.(1 Rippon Street, Ballarat,
writes us :—“That her Mother” —now living in
Windsor, N.3.W.,—“ is 101 years old ; well and
active, and that it is through the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure that her life, has been prolonged.” She
was able to keep the blood pure ; kidneys active,
and the bowels regular by its use. If these im-
portant organs are strengthened and regulated
occasionally in this manner, the so-called “Terrors
of old age ” prove to be myths, and advancing
years but a kindly winter. *
DON’T GO TO SEA WITHOUT A BOTTLE
OF ENO’S “ FRUIT SALT.” “ From a town in
British Guiana, South America. —J. C. Eno, Esq.,
London. —Sir,—After two years’ trial of your
excellent ‘ FRUIT SALT, ’ I can safely say that
it has saved me much misery from colonial fevers,
indigestion, and impaired appetite, to which I
have been subject during eleven years’ residence
in the tropics. It is invaluable to travellers as a
preventive of sea-sickness and a relief from the
other ailments of life aboard ship; and, for myself,
I would as soon think of going a voyage without
my tooth-brush as my bottle of ‘ FRUIT SALT.’
With ordinary care it does not get hard and caked
as other effervescent preparations do in warm and
humid climates, and this is greatly in its favor. —I
am, Sir, yours respectfully, W.J.8.” Sold by all
chemists and stores.

jVTOTICE is hereby given that it is the intention of
BENJAMIN CRISPIN SIMPSON, of Sydney, in the

AGENTB FOR THE TRUSTEE.
Though none of the yearlings, sold the other
day, fetched IOOOgs., as Coil did last year, breeders were
quite satisfied with results. Mr. W. Bailey secured three
plums in the Carbine—Marchesa colt(ssogs.); Abercorn —
Moonstone colt (300g5.), and the Gossoon —Spice gelding
(300g5.). Etraweenie’s brother, a fine youngster by
Trenton —Nellie, brought over from Vic., went to Mr. W.
R. Wilson at 350g5., and Mr. Ike Foulsham gave 285 gs. for
the Splendor—Esperance colt. Dan. O’Brien, whose luck
seems to have gone on a holiday, only secured the
Autonomy—Bangle colt (255g5.) after spirited bidding.
He meant to have him, and anything Dan. fancies he
generally gets. In M.L. once, though, he luckily met his
master. After bidding up to 2000 gs. for a young three-
quarter brother'to Trenton, he knocked off. S. H. Gollan
capped him with 25gs. and got the “bargain.” It never
won a race.
m * * *
Manifold’s dangerous Camperdown stable won
the Cup at Onkaparinga, S.A., with Veronica, who beat
Preston ; also the Steeple with the hard-pulling Dungan,
and the Hurdles with Geometry. This stable will have a
hot “ corner ”in jumpers this winter. The speedy Pivot
is said to be a promising G.N. candidate. It was on a
trial with him that Veronica went over to beat Preston.
* * * *
Hordern’s stable scored three seconds at Rand-
wick, up to The Skipper’s easy win in the City Stakes.
On past form he was fairly thrown in, and backers seemed
to know it. Ancient Robinson Crusoe has got some good
’uns in his day, and The Skipper is by no means the worst
of the crowd.
* » * *
Music, last in a field of 16 in City Stakes, with
7.12, tells its own tale. What a show he had in last Aus.
Cup, 24 miles, with 8.10 !
* * * *
Newhaven, an original 120 gs. purchase, cost
W. T. Jones and W. Cooper 2000 gs. before the Champagne
Stakes. His new owners are said to have backed him
so heavily that the Easter Stakes win will only just about
compensate.
* * » *
Thirteen of the Hobartville yearlings auctioned
last week were geldings ; no colts. Kirkham sent up nine
geldings, but none of the Tocal lot were unsexed.
» » * »
An idea seems to exist that had Trentham been
vigorously ridden out, instead of letting his stable mate
up, he would have won the Cup. He certainly “ came
again ” when Toreador rushed up, and secured third place.
Like many others, he had his admirers, whose remarks
over the business weren’t very angelic. In France the
pari-mutuel pays out on losers if stable companions win.
* » * *
Poor jockey Mulry, buried last week, was a
native of Ireland, and a trusted rider, whose fate appeared
to be connected with Rosehill. A year ago he sustained
concussion of the brain. Kelso was averse to him riding
Thor in Rosehill Steeple, but Mulry was confident. The
accident occurred through a common cause —Thor didn’t
see the jump owing to horses being immediately in front
of him.
• * * *
While the excited crowd was yelling itself hoarse
over the popular idol after Sydney Cup, a badly-struck
bookie quietly disappeared in the confusion, leaving
behind his capacious bag, chalked “ Gone, but not
forgotten.”
* * * *
Scratching Wallace for the All-Aged mile was
wise. Taking the time as a criterion, he would have had
to break the record to beat Tir6, who shot out like a ball
at a target ; the chestnut’s slow, ground-gaining plod
would have been of no avail. He was beaten in this event
last year.
* « * *
In the case of a sluggish horse like Wallace, the
advantage of being paced by a stable companion is very
obvious. Mr. Wilson’s second string won the Sydney
Cup for his champion, probably.
* * * *
For the first time in the present writer’s recol-
lection “ books ” laid longer odds than the Tote. Dungan,
3 and 4 to 1 Onkaparinga Steeple ; Tote odds, 5 to 2.
* * * *
The hooting at Newhaven last Thursday was
described by the Argus reporter as an “unseemly demon-
stration.” The uproar of depositors at a busted-bank
meeting is also unseemly. No display of indignation
ought to be permitted in Australia.
* * * *
Wallace at the two big Autumn meetings was
Carbine over again—a bit short of condition at Fleming-
ton and cherry-ripe when he got to Randwick. Both
horses ran second for the Australian Cup.
* * * «
Demise, in Adelaide : Filgate, the worthy, if
rather fossiliferous, Melb. turfite, an astounding mine of
horsey yarns. He carries to the grave, according to his
own account, the true story of Newminster’s nobbling,
when trainer Dakin slept in a nightcap of steel and
dagger-proof blankets.
Filgate once entered a horse for a race at Rand-
wick, but the A.J.C. altered the date. Filgate refused to
run his horse, would not pay forfeit, and was “ posted.”
He sued in the Supreme Court, but was beaten on a
technical point. His argument was that the club had no
right to alter racing fixtures while horses were in training,
and, still refusing to pay up, he was placed “ beyond the
oale.” He had declared, however, that, whichever way
the suit went, he would never run a horse again in N.S.
Wales, and many Vic. sportsmen of the day followed his
example.
* * •
“ On ever-deceiving l form, Trentham, with only
1.4, looks like annexing Adelaide Cup next month, unless
Bradford is the stable choice.
* * * *
In five events at Randwick backers had to lay
odds on the favorite. The tote never asks for odds on. It
takes your money and pays a div.
* » * *
The Harvester, not thoroughly, wound up when
ne left Melb., was practically raced into form at Rand-
wick. He is a confirmed stayer, and won, as a three-year-
old, V.R.C. Champion in 31jsec. better time than the
Plate was run on Saturday.
* ♦ * *
The Steeplechase and Plate, both three miles,
were won in the same time, 6.17. Think of it! Had old
Mikado 11. or a first-class mule started in the Plate, either
.night have got a place.
* * * *
Estimated that the ring lost <£Bo,ooo over the
first two Randwick days. Only the Income-tax people
oould believe this. Where would Ikey get eighty thou. ?
Bad times, cronk practices, and the ridiculous odds
offered have brought heavy betting down to bedrock,
live-pound wagerers of years ago now talk in a half-
crown strain.
» * * *
Such a rising crowd as Coil, Tir6, Newhaven,
Resolute, Cydnus, The Officer, Gozoczar, and possibly
Huret, threaten to turn next season’s classic events and
handicaps into prize-riddle competitions. And there’s a
chance, too, of another Harvester being foisted on an un-
suspecting public at the last moment, or a second Water-
fall creeping into prominence when the crowd isn’t
looking.
* * * *
Wilson’s galloping goldmine didn’t have a
Trentham to bust the field for him in A.J.C. Plate, and
was beaten fairly and squarely, not only by The Har-
vester, but by Fort, at even weights. The “ race” was a
monotonously slow affair. When the field did wake up,
Wallace wasn’t fast enough. That’s his trouble. Gough
should have come away long before the finish, and made
his own pace. The slow time, 6.17, shows that this could
have been done with advantage. When The Harvester
put steam on the rest looked like a lot of crocks. Care-
fully nursed throughout, he put in one dash that ad-
mitted of no serious opposition.
The only excuse advanced for Wallace s defeat
is that his previous races had a non-beneficial effect on
his highly-strung frame. He presented a tired, world-
weary appearance before the start, and had an unpleasant-
looking bruised heel, but his connections thought it was
only throwing away a stake not to start him.
* * * •
The slow, exercise canter at which the field went
in the Plate caused people to wonder why the club hadn’t
put a trot on the programmes.
* * * *
The only way to ensure a good, sound race over
a long course is to adopt the time limit. This is the
V.R.C.’s rule in connection with the Champion. The
Harvester was half a second over the time when he won
his Champion, and only got half the stake.
* * * *
The pile distributed on Harvester before the
three-mile start foreboded a big surprise. Sheet Anchor’s
son is at the top of the tree, and apparently equal to
downing Wilson’s pet again if thev meet in the spring.
* * *
Randwick Second Steeple was a blundering,
wearisome spectacle. The top-weight—Mikado 11., a real
good ’un —won his first race since up from a spell: ancient
Bushman, who has had a lengthy and varied career, fol-
lowing home. The other seven either turned tail or
turned turtle. A couple of beauties who fell seemed to
“chance” their jumps. When a horse does that, it
generally means a job for the undertaker.
* * * *
Harold Bickford, winner of the Druids’ Wheel
Race (£200), at Meib., is perhaps the most likely of all the
present Australian riders to develop into a first-flight
man. There are about half-a-dozen Australasian men
who take it in turns to beat each other. Among horse-
racing men this is significant. “ Too near each other for
any one of them to be a wonder,” say the equine wise-
acres, and this applies with equal force to cyclists. One
Melb. cycling journal (nicknamed Parsons’s Weekly)
styles that modest young man the champion. Now, the
champion has not won one Australasian championship
this season, and has gone down before Megson pretty con-
sistently.
* * * «
Kux, the German rider who lowered the
Adelaide-to-Melb. record by 6 hours, had the assistance of
all the German-Australian wheelists available to pace him
on his journey. Bergstrom started him at Adelaide,
Seiper picked him up at Kingston, and, after several youths
ending in “ berg ” and “ heimer ” had taken him as far as
Williamstown, Miss Lucy Beyer led him the last, ten miles
to Melb. Town Hall. Miss Beyer is the 20-year-old
daughter of the late Peter Beyer, the Teutonic gymnastic
teacher of the majority of Melb. schools 10 years ago, and
has been reared in an atmosphere of dumb-bells and
ponderous clubs. She is now eleven stone of shapely
muscle capable of turning off a mile in 2.30, or sending
the average man “out” for the required lOsecs. in one
hit; nevertheless, she is a remarkably pretty girl, and one
of the few women who look well on a machine.
Kux possesses abnormal lung capacity, his dif-
ference in chest circumference between inspiration and
expiration being 4*4in. He pedalled the first 40 hours
without sleep. Then he slept for four hours, and travelled
for another 24 before taking an hour’s nap. The whole
distance was done at an average speed of 9 J miles an hour.
* * * *
By the way, how is it that so many foreign
names appear among racing cyclists and so few Irish ?
The account of a Melb. football-match reads like the
charge-sheet of a Dublin riot, yet last Austral’s programme
gave only Huurigan and Hogan to defend the honor of
ould Oireland.
* * * »
At latest dates the owner of Mystery was pre-
pared to back his trotting mare for another go against
cyclist Harris, on the condition that they start in oppo-
site directions, and travel strictly on their own to the
winning-post. The quadruped’s legs versus the biped’s
ditto, and devil take all pace-making. A fair proposal.
• * • •
“ Hee ” Donahoo, sole survivor of the Melb.
yachting accident, is a well-known Vic. cricketer and
footballer, being a brother of the brilliant interprovincial
bat of that ilk, and a nephew of “Jack” Conway, who
engineered the first Australian Eleven. He is a big,
strapping young fellow, but not much of a swim-
mer ; and how he kept afloat for 15min. after getting a
nasty bruise on his back, and with his trousers hanging
about his feet, is a mystery to those who know his
abilities in the water. “ Alf.” Terry, the unfortunate
owner of the yacht, who was one of the three drowned,
was a son of Terry, of Terry’s brewery, and though but
23 years old, was himself brewer at Lathams.
« » * «
If Parsons has got “a little bundle” he left it at
home. on the occasion of Porta’s recent ben. at Melbourne.
He won his heat of the 2-Mile Handicap in the fastest
time of the day, and just lost the final of the same race
through M'Lean falling in front of him about 30yds. from
home. He beat Porta in the 4-Mile and 2-Mile match and
lost in the Mile. He won his heat of the J Mile Invitation
and was just beaten by Harris in the final for the same
race.
* * * •
English rowing authorities have upheld N.S.W.
in its squabble with Vic. about Dawson. Which doesn’t
alter the position one jot. The practice of sending ’Ome
for decisions on athletic disputes of all kinds is ridiculous.
It flatters the English know-alls, and manifests gross
ignorance of the principles of the pastimes in which
“ colonials” are supposed to excel.
* * * *
J. L. Sullivan, apropos of a second talking-
match between Corbett and Fitzsimmons : “ Yes, Fitz.
can beat Corbett. It would be a long fight, but the Aus-
tralian would win. Corbett should have been a preacher.
He was a good man once, but isn’t now.”
♦ * » *
Sydneyites who remember Bob Fitzsimmons
faking at Foley’s old hall, can imagine the red-headed one
slouching round Maher and hitting all out of distance
until he got his man in position, and then like a flash out
came his right on the “ spot.” Fitz. said there were only
two blows struck during the fight. When his right
reached Maher’s jaw, and when the back of Maher’s head
reached the stage.
‘ ‘ Men feel with their brains, and women
think with their hearts.”
The last batch of Q. elections fixes the
composition of the new Assembly as 41 Ministeria-
lists, 20 Labor, 6 Opposition, and 5 Independent.
Jack Hamilton’s seat for Oook is still in doubt.
“Steel-rail” Phillips, a Govt, toady, has been
deservedly ousted by a Labor man for Carpen-
taria ; and storekeeper Newell replaces Labor
Rawlings for Woothakata. Excluding Speaker
Cowley, the Govt, party musters 40 against 31
possible opponents. All the Independents, how-
ever, are not reliable Oppositionists ; and means
could doubtless be found to make some of them
“ vote right ” or stay away on a critical division.
The net result of the election is a nominal increase
of two in the total possible Opposition vote, and
a gain of three seats by the Labor-party. Prac-
tically, if the Govt, party can hold together, con-
ditions are almost “ as they were.”
Gunnedah Land Board has finished one
section of the “ Mercadool Land Case,” an
apparently interminable suit dragged out to deter-
mine whether the selections on Mercadool run, in
Walgett (N.S.W.) district, were genuine selections
taken up by people who really yearned to “go on
the land,” or were merely dummied in the good
old fashion for the benefit of the station-owners
or mortgagees. After 47 days’ struggle,
with the help of expensive counsel, and of
many station - managers, boss cookies, and
other witnesses, the Board has decided that,
so far as the selections of one James
Wilson are concerned, James was “ a mere
counter, a mere dummy,” at a salary of JR per
week, with a bonus of <£lso when the selections
were duly transferred. There are only 14 other
cases to be considered, in which similar questions
are raised, and, when the Board has wrestled with
them all, the Lands Minister thinks that “no
doubt there will be an appeal ” to the Supreme
Court—and thence to the Privy Council. The
“ Mercadool case ” bids fair to extend far into the
20th century.
Out of nine new magistrates gazetted in
the Barwon (N.S.W.) electorate, three are dead
(one nearly a year), and one left in December to
reside permanently in England.
The vacancy caused by the death of H. F.
Manning. Clerk of Tas. Assembly, is being eagerly
sought after by every local M.P.’s distant relative.
The appointment being practically in the gift of
the Speaker, quite an army of billet-hunters are
trying to deposit salt on the tail of Mr. btanora
Bird. Rumored that the latter desires the billet
himself.

“My daughter was afflicted with
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fall out, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, and she was, in truth,
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to sav that this wonderful
medicine completely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman. ’

The English Prison Board has decided to
abolish the treadmill, crank, and oakum-picking.
Darling Downs Gazette (Q.) on reform
and the need for a State Drink Department:—
Firstly, reform in whisky. Queensland’s whisky, as
provided from the Tweed to Cape York, is in greater need
of reformation than anything I know, unless it be its poli-
ticians. Made principally of old boots, kerosene, tobacco,
and white spirit, it is universally drunk—by the universal
drunk. It has filled our asylums, our hospitals, our gaols
with wrecks. Let the whole liquor-trade he under Govern-
ment control. Let us have Government pubs. The
advantage would be astonishing. Our politicians, who
live on whisky, would he pervaded with a purer spirit.
The democratic suburb of Collingwood
(Melb.) supports 30 bakers—29 of them non-
unionists. The difference between union and
non-union wages represents something over |d. a
loaf, so the sweater can sell his bread Id. cheaper
and still make a larger profit. Therefore, the
local working man whoops for union principles
and alleges, if any question arises, that his wife
bought from the non-union sweater without his
knowledge. It is now proposed to put a large,
glaring brand on all bread made in union shops,
so that the house-father can’t pretend not to know
what kind of bread he is eating.
The Transvaal cloud again lowers. Ap-
parently Chamberlain has taken advantage of his
kudos to press the Outlanders’ claims further than
Kruger is prepared to yield. There is absolutely
no reason, from the Boer point of view, why
Kruger should yield one inch. Twice the Boers
have been driven by the English from territory to
which they had at least as much right as anybody
else : it is time they turned at bay. Their methods
of life may be barbarous, their homes may be
dirty ; but, such as they are, there is no reason
why they should be sacrificed to the greed of
British or Jew syndicates.
In Maoriland the Tory Opposition has the
solid beer and whisky vote of the country, and it
is now imploring the Cold Tea party to join it.
“It might reasonably be expected,” says the
Otago Daily Times, “that a Temperance party
worthy of the name, instead of isolating itself
with a single idea, would make common cause
with the Opposition in order to bring about a
purer state of matters.” Meanwhile, the Cold
Tea crowd is helping the Tory faction quite
enough. It managed to split the Liberal vote at
Christchurch so accurately that over 8000 Liberals
are disfranchised, and the Beer and Big Loan
candidate got in as the representative of only 5000
voters.
The German socialistic newspaper, Yor-
waekts, is said to have been established on a
sound financial basis by the very Government
authorities who wanted a chance to suppress it.
Vokwaerts was bringing itself out with much
difficulty, and the death mark seemed to be coming
on its young brow when Emperor William gave
the word that it was a dangerous publication
which all loyal officials must follow with a watch-
ful eye. So thousands of officials suddenly bought
V orwaerts in order to keep an eye on it, and the
circulation of the beastly disloyal rag having gone
up like a rocket, remained up. Radical journalism
all the world over owes a good deal to its fervent
enemies.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone

ment tied things so artistically in a hard knot that
coal-measures in private lands sold by the State
prior to tL can’t be worked either by the State or
tne private owner or anybody else until the law is
amended. The State didn’t either retain the coal

anybody. The Parliament which built this act
consisted largely of lawyers. .

South Melb. Council has decided that the
local Joss house (the Chow Cathedral) does not
come under the definition of “a building used solely
for religious purposes,” and is not exempt from
rates. Consequently John Chow is requested to
dump up <£2o arrears. John is going to fight it,
and should win if there is either horse-sense or
equity in Vic. law. The Joss house is quite as
sacred an edifice as the average allegedly Christian
establishment, and is, in reality, a house of god,
for Joss is there in person, rivalling Solomon in all
his glory; whilst in the church of the pious
Briton the reigning Deity is too often only repre-
sented by the few loose threepennies in the pants-
pocket of the Rev. Deuteronomy Snufflebust.

Dear Bulletin. —The N.S.W. Bill to give
relief to selectors doesn’t go far enough. What is
needed is a Benevolent Asylum for selectors only,
where the men who have spent all their capital
and the best part of their lives in improving
Crown lands, could find a quiet retreat where land-
boards cease from troubling, and the mortgage
takes a rest. The inmates could employ the time
between meals in drafting a Land Act that would
allow bona fide selectors to earn almost as comfor-
table a living as the squatters’ perjured “ dum-
mies.” No doubt in such an asylum “Steele
Rudd ” would be able to finally dispose of old
“Dad,” and that fabulous example of his class
could amuse the rest of the inmates with practical
illustrations of how he ploughed his 40 acres with
a broken shear-blade, and harrowed it per dog
harnessed to a currycomb, and how, when the
‘ ‘ crop ” was promising 90 bushels to the acre, a
neighbour’s cow sat down on it so hard that it
never rose again, and the storekeeper seized his
farming implements for his grocery-bill. Of
course, a necessary addition to the asylum would
be a House of Detention where any young men who
developed symptoms of settling on the land could
be kept under observation. To effectually restore
these unfortunates to reason old “ Dad ” should
be engaged to visit them daily with a two hours’
lecture on agriculture as it is practised on “Our
Selection.” If any failed to recover their reason
under this treatment, they should be removed to
Callan Park without further waste of time.
There is no other way.- — Cripps Clark.

Railway-carriage doors with noiseless,
automatic opening and closing action are to be
placed on some of the Melb. suburban lines this
month. In connection with this invention there
is an ingenious device by which the name of the
approaching station is shown in each carriage.
The inventor is a Melb. bank clerk, named Fraser,
who has already been offered a handsome sum for
his invention by a big English railway co.

An inevitable result of the Lormer Board
report was the interviewing of sundry Vic. poli-
ticians by an obsequious emissary from Melb.
’Erald. Each M.L.A. in turn was begged to
state his views on the situation, and each of these
oracles replied, with the air of one who is reveal-
ing an unexpected truth, that magistrates Rapi-
port, Baxter, and Bird deserved to be wiped off
the bench. There is nothing sadder in modern
journalism than the custom of utilising passing
events for the glorification of dull platitudinarians.
If typhoid fever is more prevalent than usual in
Smellbonrne, a reporter waits upon members of
Parliament for information as to what ought to
be done, and when these famous persons have
duly stated that the drainage system needs im-
proving, the stale chestnut is hurled at the public
by their evenin’ journal as though it were a
thunderbolt from Heaven.

“I expect so much with my wife that I
cannot expect money. ”
J. Hotsou and Co.'s attempt to get further
Government assistance for their Melb. meat-
freezing business almost deserved to succeed for
the sake of its splendid audacity. Mr. Hotson,
who seems to have started his Newport works with
more enterprise than capital, got a 14 years’ con-
ditional lease from the Railway Dept. The busi-
ness flourished, nevertheless the conditions of the
lease re the amount to be expended by the tenants
on buildings and machinery were not fulfilled.
After a while, Hotson obtained, at one fell swoop,
50 per cent, extension of his original lease term
and a large reduction in the amount he had con-
tracted to put into buildings and plant. Another
year or two rolled on —the business flourishing
more than ever—and then Hotson came along
with a proposal that Government should fix
up new premises, leaving him to supply
machinery only. At this stage of the case a little
growling from opposition meat-freezers was heard
in the distance. The Western and WimmeraCo.,
which has put about «£20,000 (including the cost
of a new jetty) into its business on the north shore
of Corio Bay, began to talk of taking action to
secure Government concessions, either in the form
of ‘ ‘ facilities ” such as Hotson enjoyed, or a money
equivalent. Whereupon Hotson dropped his
latest proposal, and suggested an alternative to
the effect that “ his firm should make their own
improvements at the works, provided that the Go-
vernment deducted from the rental annually a
sum which, if capitalised for 19 years, would be
equal to the present necessary expenditure on the
works.” Premier Turner, warned by those growls
in the distance, turned a deaf ear to the voice of
the charmer, and for the present Hotson is bound
down to his lease, and meat-freezing in Melbourne
and elsewhere will have to be conducted on private
commercial principles.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
Ct TZHUR-ZEIE CASTLES” and C-AIPS TLATsT. 75
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co.. Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles’’ and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “Capstan.” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Attention, Please!
ASTONISHING, isn’t it, that eighty out of every hundred manufacturers of Hair Restorers are
positively bald ! Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that we are fast becoming a bald-
headed people ! “ Physician, heal thyself !-” could be most appropriately applied to these impostors
and charlatans. I can destroy all parasital growth as it affects the hair directly, but THESE parasites
I cannot remove. Their life or death is in your hands. Ilithertb they have reaped a rich harvest at
your expense. The result is the premature loss of your hair. You can stop their little game by
refusing to buy their nostrums. If you suffered from any ailment of body you would not consult a
bricklayer or a carpenter. You would go direct to a doctor who had made it a life’s study Whv
should you continue to use preparations that are manufactured by people who do not possess even an
elementary knowledge of the “ Hair and its treatment ? ”
Send two stamps for my Illustrated Pamphlet on the “Hair and its Treatment.” To all whc
desire a good head of hair, it is worth its weight in gold. Every person who wishes to escape pre-
mature baldness cannot do better than use my *

Aboriginal Names.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Prof. Morris, of Melbourne, has started to ex-
plain the origin of some of our aboriginal words
and, as a matter of course, will drift into the usual
grotesque blunders incidental to information col-
lected promiscuously from miscellaneous sources
probably few or none of which are acknowledged’.
If his explanation of many other words is similar
to that of “wallaby,” “ wallaroo. ” and “ yabba ”
as lately recorded in The Bulletin, his dictionary
will need to be followed at once by a new and re
vised edition.
My object here is to fix the authentic origin of a
few well-known Australian words, and place them
beyond all further dispute. The first blacks with
whom the whites associated were those of Sydney
and Botany Bay, followed by those of the Hawkes-
bury, Hunter, and Twofold Bay. To the dialects
of those places we naturally turn for the earliest
aboriginal words in use among the white men.
_ The most interesting vocabulary in my posses-
sion is one taken down from the lips of Bennilong,
one of the two Sydney blacks who went to Eng-
land with Gov. Phillip in 1792. Attached to this
is another taken from a George’s River black named
Walwarra, in 1803, by Thomas Jarret Ives, who
lived with the blacks and spoke their language.
Both vocabularies were printed at the Sydney
Gazette office in 1809. In the Botany dialect I
find the first record of the word “myall ” the
name given to a stranger. This word will ’be re-
ferred to hereafter. The Botany dialect gave the
word ‘kobbera” for head. At Sydney it was
cabboora. It gave us “ mundowie,” the word
for leg, though widely used for the foot by the
whites. From Botany came the words wombat,
wommera, yarraman, wonga-wonga, gunya, waddy,
wollaba (wallaby), wallaroo, heelamin, budjerie’
corobberie, baal, and curriejung. Yarraman was
yeeraniahn,” from yeera, the teeth, and mahn,
long -literally “ long teeth,” a name for the horse.
The negative was “ beeal ” (baal), and the affir-
mative yobeen. ’ From Botany came the once-
familiar words, “ paialla ” to tell, “ durellie ” to
fight, “ coolahra ” angry, “ jerran ” frightened,
and “ goori ” for fat. Curriejung was the Hibiscus
Heterophylla, and the name was also used for
fishing-lines made from the bark of that plant.
From Botany comes the word boomerang. Wal-
warra called it “ booniering ” and “bummering.”
The Botany tribe called the native bear “ coolah,”
the same as one of the bear-names at Morton Bay.
All these words were scattered by the pioneer
timber-getters, settlers, or squatters, from Sydney
to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The “ wallaby ” of
Botany was the paddymella of the scrubs. The
grey kangaroo was “ bobroo,” the red one “ gob-
reea.” In the Sydney dialect “ coojee ” was an
oyster, and “ Bondi ” the heavy nulla. The word
“ nulla-nulla,” the light club, came from Twofold
Bay. “Euroka,” the sun, belonged to Botany
and Sydney.
Leaving Sydney, we pass over the “Wodi”
dialect of Shoalhaven and Illawarra, and arrive at
the “Awaba” dialect of Newcastle and Port
Macquarie. A vocabulary of this dialect was
obtained by Threlkeld, the missionary who went
there in 1826, and who has left us the most com-
plete and valuable work yet written on any Aus-
tralian dialect. In “ Awaba ” the boomerang has
become / turrama,” and the “ merree ” for dog at
?tm a cllled ‘ y °° k . i , ” \ the slut - however, bfing
“ warrt*l ” T- 66 ’ • A tame dog and slut are
is still unchanged. Tht “ W ° rd “ Wommara ”
Crossmg t he range we enter the two great and
widespread dialects of Kamilroi and “ Wired

“ ' h a ' ie - Here we have the generic word
comes 1- tl i nalr T ) ,M r al , l blacks - From the Kamil
( mes the word kookaburra” for jackass, and
buralga (boorallga) for the native companion.
TheW°r f ßa /w IS ord becomes “ burallgum.”
hst of Wiradhuri words was collected by
rchdeacon Gunther at Wellington Vale in 1836
in Kamil the boomerang has become “ barman. ”
11ns is also the name at Morton Bay.
oil 16 w ° r d <l jumbuck ” for sheep appears origin-
ally as jimba, joinbock, dombock, and dumbog.
n each case it meant the white mist preceding
a shower, to which a flock of sheep bore I
strong resemblance. It seemed the only thing
the aboriginal imagination could compare it to!
From the “ Kamil ” and “ Wirri ” (the negatives)
dialects comes coolabah ” or “ coolibar, ” for the
box-gums.
From Wirri comes “billa,” a river or creek.
Attached to the Morton Bay word “bong” for
dead, it became billabong, a dry or dead water-
course.
There, too, is the word “dilly,” fine wood dust
hence dillybag, the small bag in which the gins
carried the sticks for making fire, and fine stuff
for igniting.
Here we first find the word “gidya,” the name
ot one of the acacias. Also the word ‘ ‘ gibba, ” the
vhite quartz crystal used at the bora cemetery.
Hence gibbar, or kippar, the young man initiated :
also gibbir, used recklessly by the whites for
any kind of stone.
The wommara ’ has now become “ womarr.”
Here a stranger is still mayol, or myall, and all
strange blacks were described as wild blacks by
any tribe. Hence myall, a wild black.
In Wirri the dingo is warrigal. The word dingo,
pronounced “ deeng-go,” appears in Bennilong’s
h s f as the dog’s name in the Sydney tribe.
Mopoke ” (a nightjar) is the “mobock” of the
Sydney blacks.
Moorabinda” will learn that her pen-name in
the Wirri dialect means “sound asleep,” not an
appropriate cognomen for a fair writer who is ex-
tremely wide awake. But consolation may be
found in the fact that in a northern dialect “ Moo-
rabinda ” means “stately emu.”
In the “ Peecumbill ” dialect of the Weir and
Macintyre, meeal, or myall, is the generic term for
a man. In no tribe is it the name of the acacia
pendula. That error arose as follows. The coast
blacks traded with the inland stranger or myall
blacks for myall or brigalow spears. They called
the spear myall, or myall spear, because they got
it from myall or strange blacks. A brigalow
spear, especially black brigalow, smells exactly
like myall, and was called myall by the blacks for
the same reason. The coast blackboys, with
pioneer squatters, when they reached myall
country, recognised the wood and called it myall,
after the spear name. Myall was first seen by Sir
Thomas Mitchell on the Peel River in 1836.
Finally this acacia became known as myall to
blacks and whites from the Peel River to the
Peak Downs. At Morton Bay the brigalow
acacia was “Bonnoroo.”
When the bushman refers to his “ hard yakker ”
he is using the word “ yacca” (work of any kind)
from the old Turrabool dialect of the Brisbane
blacks. The word first appears in 1838, iu the
convict period of Morton Bay. The word
jackeroo, a station new-chum, comes also from
the old Brisbane blacks, who called the pied crow
shrike ( Stripera graculina) ‘ ‘ tehaceroo, ” a gabbling 1
and garrulous bird. They called the German
missionaries of 1838 “jackeroo,” a gabbler, be-
cause they were always talking. Afterwards they
applied it to all white men. The Russell River
blacks call the same bird “ jowa-jowa,” from jowa
the mouth, literally “all mouth.”
The origin of the word kangaroo was published
ivT ln T ? S j X ycars Captain Cook got it from
the Endeavor River blacks, who pronounce it
to-day exactly as it is spelled in the great navi-
gator s journal, but they use it now only for the
big toe.
Either the blacks in Cook’s time called the
kangaroo “big toe” for a nick-name, as the
American Indians speak of the “big horn,” or the
man who asked the name of the animal was hold-
ing it by the hind foot, and got the name of the
long toe, the black believing that was the part to
which the question referred.
On the east coast of Australia a widely-distri-
buted word for an old man kangaroo is “ goora-
min. ’ It extended from Dubbo, in N.S. Wales,
to Rockhampton.
All the native tribes of Australia spoke varia-
tions of only one language. A river or range of
mountains often separated two distinct dialects.
In 1861, when Walker went out with two white
men and six blacks to look for Burke and Wills,
he met one tribe on the Gulf of Carpentaria
speaking a dialect unintelligible to all his black
troopers except one from Deniliquin, in N.S.
Wales. This black spoke “Kamilroy,” a dialect
which Ridley, in 1855, found intelligible over a
distance of 800 miles.
Another extensive dialect was the “Yoocum-
Yoocum ” of the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed
Rivers, and part of New England.
One remarkable fact in conclusion. The Botany
Bay blacks called rain “banna,” and a little girl
rnyee (the name given by Lady Carington to
her Sydney-born baby). These words I found
again 1500 miles north of Botany among the
Russell River blacks, with the same meaning, and
occurring nowhere in the intermediate dialects.
In Botany Bay there is a river called “ Woronora,”
originally “ Wooroono6ra.”
In the Russell dialect the centre peak of Bellen-
den-Ker is “ Wooroonodr&n.”
(( There is a curious coincidence in the fact that
banna, ’ the Botany blacks’ name for rain, was
one of the Irish words for water, and that the
Irish word “boreen,” a pathway, was identical
with the Morton Bay “boreen ” for the small
pathway from the large to the small bora circles.
If we take isolated words, we might connect the
Australian dialects with half the languages of the
human race.
At Rockhampton, fire is “wee,” and Stanley
fot the same word for fire in Central Africa. In
forth Queensland I found the word “ alba ” used
for white, the same as the Latin.
In The Bulletin of Jan. 20, one of your bards
has a poem headed “ Tareel-Dool. ” In the Kamil-
roy dialect it means a place of “brown reeds”—
from “ tareel ” reeds, and “dool” brown. It was
in old times, and may be still, the name of a reed-
encircled lagoon on the Namoi. In Ridley’s vo-
cabulary of 1851 it is spelled “Tarildul,” pre-
sumably the “ Drilldool ” of the modern ortho-
graphical Goth who turned Yarr into “Yass,”
Walgeer into “ Walgett,” Narrungdeerie into
“ Narandera,” and committed a few other similar
outrages.

The deepest spot of all the oceans was

At Port Macquarie, N.S.W., parrots of a
kind apparently new to the district have been rava-

A terrible warning to amateur fire-brigades
is cabled from Lille (France). Six firemen went
prowling around for a drink at the local hospital
after extinguishing a conflagration there, and
found a bottle of clear spirit which they took to
be gin. The stuff happened to be poison, and the
half-dozen thirsty heroes died immediately.
“ It may be taken for granted that every
intelligent person has read ‘Trilby,’” cackles a
Melbourne press goose. What a strange concep-
tion of human intelligence is expressed in such a
remark! Every eager devourer of fashionable
modern novels and novelettes has read Du Mau-
rier’s yarn.
Stead’s latest ad captandum dodge is a
“ Penny Hymnal,” as a preliminary ad. for which

and strong indeed must be the spiritual rapport
between that podgy little sybarite and the ethere-
ally ascetic Newman. Herbert Spencer is the
only man of the lot who says, in effect, “ D—n
hymns ! —I hate ’em ! ” Who can imagine a
Spencer being “helped” by a hymn !
On his Horn Central Australian trip Prof.
Baldwin Spencer, of Melb. University, got two
new species of marsupial “mice’’with specially
fat tails, and conjectures that during droughts
they live on their fat, as camels and zebras do on
their hump-fat. Also, he met burrowing marsu-
pial “ rats,’ - blind like moles, and living on ants
and ant-eggs. Likewise, caught the “ parenthic ”
(varantus (jitjantcus), an Bft. land-lizard ; frogs
which, just before a drought, balloon themselves
out with water, go to sleep in the mud, and only
wake up when it rains ; spiders which build 15ft.
wide webs ; and spiders which whistle.
Melbourne Harbor Trust will go broke
shortly, unless Providence or the Government
intervenes. Its average expenditure is £25,000 a
year more than its income, and the borrowed
money on which it has been living is nearly ex-
hausted. Thomas Loader, of the City of Mel-
bourne Bank, is one of the valuable old men who
has helped to run the Trust into its present awful
condition, and said condition is another proof of
the wisdom of J. Service’s contention that the
companies law shouldn’t be too strict, else Valu-
able men like Loader will go out of the directorial
business. - Considering the C.O.M. Bank and the
Melbourne Harbor Trust, for both of which he
was partly responsible, the necessity of not driving
men like Loader out of the business is quite
apparent.

Spicer’s Courtship.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spicer was a selector; why he chose to be a selec-
tor rather than enjoy comparative ease and
affluence as a corporation day-laborer or a wharf-
hand or navvy is inexplicable. He had taken to
the wilderness, built his smart bark hut in the
centre of an apparently impenetrable forest, and
was now actively engaged eating his way out
again. Along-the bank of the trickling creek he
had cleared an acre or so where a few fruit trees
flourished, and a methodical little vegetable-
garden looked green and encouraging. Dick
Spicer was a methodical man; what he did he did
well, and he was always doing. Dick was small,
and he looked puny lifting his pigmy axe to those
mighty gums, and patiently hewing splinters out
of the eompact bush. Having little or nothing to
say to his scattered neighbors, he exchanged small
talk with his hens, and favored Griffin, the low-
comedy dog-of-all-work, with his opinion of things.
Mr. Spicer was a bachelor approaching 50, wiry,
leathery, deliberative, and very diffident in com-
pany. But, despite his apparent uneasiness when
chance threw him into the society of females, Dick
was looking about for a wife. The stillness of the
long evenings and the solitary Sundays implanted
a great yearning for the companionship of a good
wife in his lonely heart. In looking about, the
selector’s view was very limited. There was not
an unmarried woman of suitable years within a
radius of 12 miles. Of all the approachable
females, he admired Mrs. Clinton the most, and
his only hope lay in the fact that Clinton was in
feeble health, and reported to be sustaining life
precariously with one lung.
Clinton held a block about a mile up the creek,
and Spicer paid him occasional abrupt and un-
ceremonious visits there. Sometimes he would
lean against a door-jamb, with not more than his
head inside, and pass a few remarks relative to
nothing in particular, in an irresponsible sort of
way; but more frequently he just stood about
outside, and criticised the poultry in audible
soliloquy, or reflected aloud upon Clinton’s ridicu-
lous notions about dairy-work and vegetable-
growing. However, he always displayed a proper
neighborly concern in inquiring after Clinton’s
health before leaving.
“ Y’ain’t feelin’ no better, I s’pose ?” he would
ask, with an appearance of anxious interest that
quite touched the sick man. Clinton was always
feeling “pretty bad.” He said as much in his
dull, heavy manner, and Dick would go off to in-
dulge in contemplation, and consult his dog.
i Spicer did not wish Clinton to die, he did not
want to hurry him up ; he was a patient, dispas-
ionate man, and the possibility of his neigh-
bor’s early demise entered into his calculations
merely as a probable circumstance which, however
regrettable, could not reasonably be overlooked.
Clinton substantiated predictions, and obligingly
died within a reasonable time, and Dick rfide
solemnly in the funeral cortege, behind the drays,
on a lame cart-horse borrowed from Canty for the
occasion.
After the funeral he looked in upon the widow,
and, feeling inspired to say something conso-
latory and encouraging, expressed his belief
that she wouldn’t mourn much about Peter.
“’Tain’t worth while,” he said, Dick’s com-
mand of language was only sufficient to en-
able him to say. the thing he meant once in
a. dozen tries, and on this occasion he was con-
scious the moment he had spoken that the sen-
timent expressed was hardly appropriate to the
occasion. Before he could frame an apology the
disconsolate widow attacked him with a spear-
grass broom, and stormed him out of the house.
He walked home thoughtfully, afflicted with a
nettle-rash and a vague idea that perhaps he had
not made an altogether satisfactory beginning.
But Spicer was not cast down ; he had resolved
upon a plan of courtship, and the object of his
first manoeuvre was to break his intentions gently
to the widow. This he thought to accomplish by
hanging round the house a good deal. He would
haunt her selection in the cool of the evening, or,
in his more audacious moments, perch himself on
the chock-an’-log fence running by the side of the
house, and whistle an unmelodious and windy jig
which was intended to convey some idea of his
airy nonchalance and great peace of mind.
It was a long time before Dick progressed from
the fence to the wood-heap, and meanwhile the
widow had not seemed to pay any particular atten-
tion to his movements. He sometimes addressed
her with a portentous truth bearing upon the
dieting of laying hens, or the proper handling of
cows, or the medical treatment of ailing chickens ;
but usually satisfied himself with a significant
grin and a queer twist of the head that was his
idea of sheer playfulness and waggery. The
neighbors came to notice him over-looking the
selection or perched on the fence supervising the
weather and things generally, and predicted that
there would be “amarryin”’ up the creek pre-
sently. Presently ! Spicer did nothing hastily,
nothing to lead anybody to believe that he had not
all eternity to come and go on. He never con-
sidered the flight of time, and had made many
calculations that carried him on to the end of the
next century, without discovering any incon-
gruity.
He did arrive at the wood-heap eventually,
though. Mrs. Clinton’s boy John was too young
to wield an axe with any effect, and one afternoon
Dick lounged over to the logs, took up the axe,
and examined it with an air of abstraction. He
weighed it carefully in his hand, and satisfied his
curiosity by trying it on a log. When he had
chopped about half-a-ton of wood he appeared
satisfied that it was a pretty good axe. That
evening he chuckled all the way up the creek, and
all the time it took to prepare his tea, and towards
bedtime confided to Griffin, with more chuckles,
his opinion that it was “ ’bout’s good’s done.”
“She can’t go back o n that,” he said with
assurance.
But Spicer lingered at this stage for a long
time ; he cut all the wood the widow needed, and
did other little things about the selection, and
often sat on the fence, as usual, and gradually
grew to be quite at home there. The widow
accepted his services now as a matter of course,
and though she was often betrayed into expres-
sions of great impatience, Dick remained oblivious,
and worked out his courtship in his own ponderous
way.
His next step towards strengthening his position
was when he took it upon himself to put several
new palings on the roof of Mrs. Clinton’s house.
This was a decided advance, and when the buxom.
little woman thanked him, his odd screw of the
face and sidelong nod clearly conveyed the im-
pression that he was beginning to regard himself
as a “ perfect devil amongst the women.” There
was more chuckling that evening, and further con-
fidences for the dog. After this Spicer ceased
working seriously on his own selection, and slowly
extended his sphere at the widow’s. He did some
gardening, and repaired the fences and dictated
improvements, but it was not till eighteen months
after Clinton’s death that he made his great stroke.
It was on Sunday afternoon that Dick discovered
Mrs. Clinton in hot pursuit of the boy John
with one shoe in her hand and one on her toot.
John was in active rebellion, and yelling his con-
tempt for the maternal authority. Spicer rose to
the occasion. He secured boy John, took off ms
belt, and proceeded to strap the unfilial youth—to
give him a grave, judicious, and fatherly larruping
—under the eye of his mother. Then the selector
drew off to consider and weigh the important step
lie had taken, with the result that, half-an-hour
after, he hung his head in at the kitchen door, and
said abruptly :
“ Treaser, when’s it to be ? .
“ Meanin’ which ? ” asked the unconscious widow.
“ Meanin’marryin’.” .
The widow thought for a moment, and said, just
as if she were completing the sale of a few eggs .
“ This day month ’ll suit me.”
“ Done,” said Spicer. , ,
Then he felt called upon to make some kind ot a
demonstration, and edged up to Mrs. Clinton in a
fidgeting sort of way, and when near enough made
as if to kiss her, paused half-way in doubt, and
then didn’t.
“ The man’s a fool,” said the stout little widow
composedly. .
They were married though, under conditions ot
great secrecy, at the parson’s house in the town-
ship, with the blinds down. It was with great
difficulty Dick was convinced of the necessity of
witnesses.
EDWARD DYSON.
All kinds get married on mining-fields.
Not long ago a Coolgardie clergyman, who had
gone to an outlying district to tie-up a couple,
found the bride-elect at the wash-tub. Wiping the
suds off her hands and arms, she faced him and
announced that she was ready. The cleric wasn’t;
he said he would call in two hours. He called,
and, to his surprise, found her still at the tub.
Somebody whistled down the adjoining shaft for
“ Bill,” and the marriage took place. A week
later, a witness of the ceremony met the cleric and
told him in a casual way that “ Bill hides his wife
awful.”
A most important, though intricate, point
has been raised in Vic. criminal court, with
reference to a prisoner’s giving evidence against
another prisoner arraigned with him. The argu-
ment is that, since such evidence would be worth-
less against the other under the old system, and,
since the object of the new system is only to allow
a man to give evidence on his own behalf, and to
prevent certain incriminating questions being
asked him at all, it is against the policy of the law
to allow such evidence to affect in any way the
interests of a co-prisoner. It is not settled yet.
Westralian Telegraph Dept, expected to
have to pay anything between ,£15,000 and
,£20,000 for the mere carriage from coast to
destination of the material for the Dundas-Eucla
section of the new overland telegraph-line to
S.A. The section will contain 525 miles of line
passing mostly through absolutely waterless and'
timberless country. The material, which includes
iron poles for the whole distance, will have to be
carried by camels. The firm of Faiz and Tagh
Mahomet was prepared to put 500 camels and 200
men —mostly Afghans—on the work, and wanted
six months in which to complete it. The material
for the section would weigh less than 900 tons.

Mr. Joseph Bosisto writes re the statement
of a Bulletin correspondent that, “ to the shame
of Australians, the finest quality of eucalyptus oil
for chemical purposes in these provinces is being
imported from California and Algeria. The euca-
lyptus grown in California and Algeria, says Mr.
Bosisto, is of one species—viz., the blue gum (glo-
bulus)— and does not contain the chemical body
termed eucalyptol—the essential medicinal agent-
in such abundance as some other species, such as
oleosa, dumosa, cnerifolia, and incrassata. Aus-
tralia ’exports tons weight of these oils annually ;
and the ‘ ‘ shame ” is a chimera.
The 40th annual demonstration of Mel-
bourne’s “Eight Hours” League, which has
hitherto confined itself to the Friendly Societies’
Gardens, will this year adopt the A.N.A. idea of
a festival at the Exhibition Building. Sports and
joys of all descriptions are promised by the manage-
ment, also the inevitable Art Union is to be thrown
in free of charge. Each shilling-admission ticket
offers a chance of winning one of a hundred, or so,
prizes, ranging from .£1000 to a fruit-dish. A
rush for these attractive investments has already
set in. The Demonstration is dated April 21st.,
and the person fated to win £ 1000 at one fell
swoop can prepare to receive -the cash on May
2nd.
The Wellington section of the newly-fran-
chised Maoriland women has had a family row.
At the early age of two-and-a-half months the
Women’s Institute was declared dead —all along
of Sarah Jones. The Bulletin gives the death-
certificate as advertised in the local papers : —

AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
MAKES PURE BLOOD.
Pure blood means health, strength, and happiness. Bad blood means
scrofula, pimples, boils, carbuncles, ulcers, tumors, and other dangerous
ailments. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla cleanses, vitalizes, and enriches the blood,
thus imparting renewed life and energy. It cures disease by removing the
cause from the system; it takes away That Tired Feeling, quickens the
appetite, and restores
HEALTH AND STRENGTH
to those who have become enervated by climatic or other influences. Out of
many thousands of testimonials, we have space here only for the following:
Mr. R. Dennis, Adelaide, So. Australia, writes: —“It is with very much
pleasure that I testify to the great benefit I received from using your
wonderful blood-purifier. I was a sufferer for years from fhdigestion, loss
of strength and appetite, and constipat ion. My whole system seemed to be
thoroughly out of order. A friend told me to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
I followed his ..dvice. though feeling discouraged at the fruitless results of
other treatment, and I am thankful to state that a few bottles completely
cured me.”
Mr. Robert Goodfei-low Mitcham, So. Australia, writes:—“l have
used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in my family for years, and would not be without
it. I used to suffer with noiis and skin eruptions, attended with great
lassitude and nVral debt ■>. In fact, I was so ill that I could not attend
to my businoK.v Be ng advised to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla I did so, and lam
happy to say tluu the meu cine restored me to perfect health. I have since
used Ayer s > ■ sai*a ilia lor my children, in various complaints, and it has
always proved effect ve. I can safely recommend it to sufferers as the best
blood-purifier in existence.”
