TO AGENTS AND READERS.
The SPECIAL NUMBER of “THE
BULLETIN” for Christmas, 1887 , will he
published on Thursday next , aud will eclipse
anything yet produced in Australia at that so-
called festive season. The issue will he nearly twice
the usual dimensions , and will contain a splen-
did collection of tales, verse, Ac., hy the best
Australian authors, together with an immense
number of high-class illustrations. A special
feature will be an exquisite pictorial sup-
plement, printed at “ The Bulletin ” Office
from a drawing by that well-known artist,
Mr. Phil. May—one of the best efforts
which his pencil has yet produced. Regarded
as a work of art and literary genius, the
CHRISTMAS “BULLETIN” will con-
fidently challenge comparison with any journal
in existence, and will yield precedence to
none.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1887.
Baughole Censorship.
The typical New South AVales taxpayer is a
compound of patience and dunderheaded-
ness. Hia political character ia mulish. He
plods along under his load, asking no ques-
tion?, and content to relieve hia feelings now
and then with an insensate kick addressed to
all whom it may concern. It is the humane
man trying to detach some of the unneces-
sary burden from the mulish creature’s back
that generally gets thatcreature’shoof planted
fair in his political bread-basket.
* * *
The late elections afforded a striking ex-
ample of this. The mule felt h's burden begin-
ning to gall with unusual severity, but would
stand no meddling on the part of those who
thought it a shame to see him tortured. His
unscrupulous and insatiable taskmasters
kept at his head while he was goaded to run
amuck, hoofing his friends right and left.
The squatter and the Calico-Jimmy holding
the reins load him up as they please with
political wares for their own exclusive use
and benefit. Railways are built at the tax-
payers’ expense, and maintained at ruinous
cost, for the sole purpose of providing the
Western squatter with an alternative means
of transit for his wool when dry seasons ren-
der cheaper water-carriage by the inland
rivers unavailable. When there is a pay-
able trade to be done is just the time when j
some of these lines are almost precluded
from doing any at all. The rivers are all
navigable, and monopolise the bulk of the
traffic both ways. When the rivers are not
navigable there is no traffic worth speaking of
for the railways. These line s involve a heavy
charge on the taxpayer, which is paid in the
shape of interest to a foreign capitalist, in
order that the squatter may have better
facilities for sending his wool to
Europe and getting his champagne and
things back in return for it. And the rates
of carriage on all the lines are differentiated
in such a way as to give the mer-
chant a monopoly against w hich no inland
storekeeper can compete. The tax-payer
conveys on his patient back the squatter s
wool to Sydney for shipment and passes
back the luxuries for which he exchanges it
in Europe without a murmur. All this is
a dead weight burden, but he patiently plods
alonor with it stolidly up and down from year
to year. Let any one go to relieve him by
adjusting taxation so as to make the squatter
' distribute the products of the land which he
monopolises amongst the community to
which it legitimately belongs, and the mule is
at once goaded by his drivers with a lash of
Sectarianism or some other “ ism to kick
out blindly and brain his own friends.
* * *
One of the most indefensible of all the
burdens piled upon the stupid New South
Wales taxpayer’s, however, is that which
he patiently humps for the wealthy
newspaper proprietors of Sydney. At enor-
mous labour he conveys every day tons of
paper for them free to all parts of the
colony. By means of differential railway-
rates the goods of the Calico Jimmies are
brought at the public expense into unfair
competition with those of inland store-
keepers, and by means of free postage the
big Sydney papers enjoy the same privilege
to the absolute ruin of provincial journalism.
We admit freely that The Bulletin is a
very considerable participant in this unfair
advantage. But the concession is one we
have not asked for, can do well without, and
have no wish to retain. It is not our fault
that the law refuses to let us pay for the
transit of our goods to our customers the
same as other people pay for theirs.
* * *
But the wealthy Freetrade journals of
Sydney all deliberately assert that the tax-
payer ought to be made carry their goods
for them. Their argument is that it is a
good thing for newpapers to be as widely dis-
tributed as possible, and that the cost of
carriage is simply money spent on the educa
tion of the people. If that is the case, then
the item ought to be charged to the expenses
of the Education Department. Let us con-
sider for a moment how it would read under
that head.
* * *
It most be borne in mind that the plea of
educational utility is the only argument by
which the principle of subsidising the news-
paper business with State money is ever
sought to be justified. Oa general grounds,
it is unquestionably a good thing to facilitate
the widest distribution of newspapers. So
it is a good thing to facilitate the general
distribution of shirts, boots, collars, pots of
jam, bags of flour, musical instruments,
cricket bats, and all sorts of things which
minister in any way to the necessities or
comforts of mankind. But it is not argued
that this should be done at the cost of the
State. The principle here is that every one
who wants anything carried for his own use
pays for it out of his own pocket This
ensures that nobody will have to pay for
what he does not himself get the use of. In
carrying newspapers, however, the principle
acted upon is totally different. Some men,
distinguished politicians and judges espe-
cially, “ never read the newspapers,” and all
these are taxed to cheapen the cost to those
who do read them. The reason furnished
for this is the same as that advanced for
taxing men without children to build schools
for the benefit of those who rear families.
The whole community, in both cases, is said
to benefit by the extension of education, and
that is why the whole community pays part
of the salary of the teacher and part of the
coat of producing the city newspaper. One
item, therefore, is as much expenditure,
under the head of Public Instruction, as the
other. Very well.
* * *
No w, the back-bone of the New S outh W ales
educational system is unsectarianism. No
thing in the way of denominational teaching
can be lawfully paid for with the taxpayer s
money. A great portion of the public
money spent on educating the people by
way of newspaper is, consequently, spent in
direct contravention of themostvital provision
which the N. S. W. Education Act contains. A
number of papers are published in Sydney for
the two combined purposes of recommending
the best forms of religion and the best
brands of rum. The objects of this sort of
journalism are twofold, first, to glorify God
in pious editorials, and next to rake in
shekels, which are the glory of the Devil,
from rum-sellers’ and quack-doctors adver-
tisements. To subsidize either of these ob-
jects with public money is distinctly forbid-
den by both the letter and the spirit of the
New South Wales education law. Where is
the difference between carrying free fourteen
stone of denominational teacher on the box
of a mail-coach and a couple of hundred-
weight of his printed teachings in the boot ?
The Education Act distinctly forbids the
carrying of the former, what law expressly
authorises the carrying of the latter ? Again,
what difference of principle is there between
carrying a grog-manufacturer s traveller and
carrying his advertisement ? The purposes
for which the rum advertisement in
the columns of the religious paper stowed
away in the boot and the red-faced 11 com-
mercial” on the box travel are identical.
Why make the animate traveller pay his
fare if the inanimate one, which often does
the most business, is carried free ? The
denominational paper is an inanimate com-
mercial-traveller, neither more nor less, run-
ning as its principal lines religion and rum.
Now, if Mr. Michael M‘Girr wanted to go
round the country travelling for “ the thrue
faith” and Toohey’s brewery, this combina-
tion of businesses would entitle him to a
pass at the public coat by steamer, rail, or
mail-coach, just as fairly as his paper, the
Freeman’s Journal, is entitled to one. In
the same way, if Dr. Barry, of the Pro-
testant Standard, packs his carpet-bag
with the thirty-nine articles and samples of
patent medicine and English he has
just as much claim to have his passage paid
as the Standard has. And if the rev. editor
of the Weekly Advocate wishes to go forth
in 'propria persona to chant the praises of
Wesleyanism and whisky, what right has he
to be refused a pass if his paper is entitled to
one ?
• * *
In claiming the subsidy anomalously
granted to it by the N S. W. Postal Department
for assisting the school-teachers, the Press
degrades its own existence and abdicates its
very right to be free. A subsidized Press
has no business to call itself a free Press.
If the State pays'it for the performance of
any duty then the State is fairly entitled to
insist upon the performance of that duty in such
manner as the State thinks best. In justice
to the taxpayer, therefore, besides acting as
Postmaster-General, Mr. 0. J. Roberts, the
much gilded ex-publican, C.M.G., should
exercise a strict censorship over the Press
of New South Wales. It is his duty to see
that the educational services for which he
pays are duly and faithfully rendered. The
editor should have his work examined just
the same as the pupil-teacher has. And,
listen here, Editor Ournow and Editor
Ward —examined, tested, and appraised by
Bunghole Roberts, C.M.G. ! Tftat is the
logic of the position you both stand in with
regard to this question.
A Roundabout Paper.
The persistent attempts made of late to supply
the prisoners in Pentridge Gaol with the little
comforts they were accustomed to when they
breathed the pure air of freedom, should form a
fine subject for the style of moralist who is never
so happy as when he finds a jewel In the head of
the toad, and a solitary virtue—like a lily bloom-
ing amidst poison flowers —in the inihd of the
most abandoned criminal. There is much good
morality—to speak in the manner of Captain
Fluellen —to bo obtained from it. For it seems
that even the benighted beings who make Crime a
profession possess certa’n virile virtues, compared
to which the Christianity of many a muoh-
respacted church-member saems but a poor and
feeble thing at its best. It is hardly a reflection
upon the brotherly love of our fellow Christians
to say that there are not many among them who
would risk their lives to save the life of their
dearest friend. Yet here are men who are sup-
posed to be dead to all sense of religion,
and past praying for, taking the chance
of violent death, time after time, not to
save the lives, or even to assist the escape, of their
imprisoned friends, but merely to provide them
with—tobacco ! Not long since a man was
brought before the Bench charged with this
charitable crime, and coolly admitted that he was
the person who was shot at by the warders in a
previous attempt, not many days before. There
was the making of a hero in that man if he had
been taken in hand in time, and his aspirations
had been directed to patriotism. It is only the
fault of his vulgar environment in youth that he
is now, in the prime of his life, compelled to eke
out a precarious and dangerous living by cracking
the cribs of honest tradesmen, instead of boldly,
and in the light of day, dipping his arms to the
elbows in the coffers of the State. Society is
answerable for this. If Society had taken him
out of his squalid surroundings and given him a
good commercial education, he might now have
been an ornament of the Treasury Benches.
* * *
But he is not altogether waste material even in
his present state. It has been discovered, by the
light of later science, that the worst and most
pestilence-breeding kind of inorganic refuse may
be utilised with benefit to the community at large.
Surely, then, the refuse of the highest class of
Organic matter —Mankind —should be disposed of
in a better way than by burying it in gaols, only
to let it loose after a time to pollute society in a
worse manner once more? When Charles VI.
of France was driven to his small wits' end to
know what to do with the brigands and Iree
Companies, who were eating him out of his king-
dom, Bertrand Du Guesclin solved the ques-
tion’ in his decisive way by taking them into
Spain to fight—and leaving them there. This
heroic plan would hardly ba practicable here un-
less we were at war with New Guinea, but it sug
gests another way out of the difficulty which does
not present such insurmountable obstacles, ihe
most dangerous section of our criminal is
composed of beings combative and destructive
by nature. These are the qualities which go
to the making of the best soldiers. Soma
of the finest regiments in the British
Army—the first to storm a breach or charge a
battery in the face of roaring death—regiments
whose tattered colours waved triumphantly in the
van of fifty fights—were, at one period, chiefly
made up of desperadoes who, in a time of peace,
would have been transported, or in gaol. They
found their proper place in the plan of things
when they became soldiers. Their instincts had
free play. They could kill, burn, and destroy, as
much as they, pleased, without fear of any
officious peace-officer taking them to prison for
doing so. It an enemy were to land on our shores,
a regiment of such men would ba worth more
than a brigade of volunteersor militia—whodo not,
as a rule, love fighting for its own sake—to throw
in his teeth. Would it not, on the whole, be
cheaper to enrol all criminals of the destructive
order in a regiment of this description, which
should be kept under strict discipline—a thing
quite practicable—than to do with them as is done
now 1 It would, at least, be making use of them in
the way in which Nature seems to have intended
them to be used, and would be a considerable gain
to the people whose houses are most likely to be
broken into, besides being a welcome relief to the
police. They would then ba a defence to society
instead of a danger. As civilisation advances
this truth wifi be appreciated and acted upon—
viz., that each individual should be placed in the
position in which his strongest (it not his highest)
qualities will have freest scope for exercise. Who
knows but in that far-off time the child who
shows signs of combativeness at an early age
will be trained up to ba a soldier or a cross-
examining counsel, aud fed with raw meat to
make him ferocious ; while the peaceful juvenile
will be marked out for a curate, or an agricultural
editor, and dieted on sago and milk to make him
milder? It is not impossible. Plato in his Ideal
Republic arranged matters in a manner not en-
tirely dissimilar. # #
There is another side to this subject which is
deserving of grave consideration. Next to the
recklessness of life displayed by the men who are
caught in attempts to supply comforts to their
friends in durance, what is the most striking
feature of the whole business? The enormous
quantity of tobacco comprised in the swags, of
course. In some of them a few odd articles of
grocery have been found, but these were as Fal-
staff's half-pennyworth of bread to his intoler-
able deal of sack compared to the amount of to-
bacco they contained, and were perhaps put in
more on account of some glimmering sense of dis-
proportion felt by the consignors in sending a
parcel of supplies consisting of only one kind of
article, than because their friends in gaol had any
real need for them—that is, the groceries. Prob-
ably, it -was for this reason that a piece of velvet
was inserted in one of the swags lately discovered.
What use could a prisoner have for velvet, unless
he wanted it to make watch-purses for the war-
ders, or a smoking-cap for, the governor of the
gaol? # ■ ,
There is a fine subject here for a debate between
smokers and anti-smokers. If men will continu-
ally risk their lives to provide their -imprisoned
‘' pals ” with tobacco, it follows that those “ pals ”
must have an extraordinary hunger for it. The
smoker might argue that this proves tobacco to be
a comfort and consolation in a time of trouble, in-
asmuch as it enables prisoners to pass their
period of confinement not altogether unhappily.
Also that it induces meditation, and favours the
formation of a calm method of placing ideas in
proper perspective ; thus causing the criminal to
review his position with regard to society, and the
odds that are against him if he should continue
his evil career. The most enthusiastic smoker
could say little more in defence of smoking than
this, if he kept strictly to the lines of the debate.
The anti-smoker would then have him in his
hands to do what he liked with him He would
crush him with one of two arguments—and let
him choose which he pleased. Thus : The fact of
there being such a demand for tobacco in gaol
proves that most criminals are smokers. If they ac-
quired this habit before they commenced their career
of crime—it was the nicotine in the tobacco they
smoked that drove them to that career; if after—
it was crime that drove them to tobacco. In
either case the advocate of smoking is impaled on
one or other of the horns of a very ugly dilemma.
At any rate it will be advisable for people who
carry , much money about with them to keep a
watchful eye on persons who smoke assiduously
in public places. The apparently respectable
man sitting on a bench in Hyde Park or
the Domain, and smoking a pipe, may be a local
preacher planning the head*3 of his next sermon,
but he is far more likely to be a burglar thinking
out calmly, under the influence of the kalizeic
surroundings, the details of a scheme for robbing
a church. It will be the ra f est course to avoid
him. Finally, as smoking seems to either induce
or develops active villainy, it will be well for timid
persons who do not smoke to observe the follow-
ing simple rules : —First.—lf compelled to travel
in a smoking carriage never play cards, and never
go too sound asleep. Second, —Never give a man
a match who asks you for one in a dark lane. By
bearing these two rules in mind the most un-
reasonable anti smoker may go through the world
and find it tolerably fair in spite of the increasing
consumption of bad cigars by the rising genera-
tion and the demand for tobacco in Pentridge and
Darlinghurst.
A “Bulletin” Lay Sermon.
THE KING OF TERRORS.
There is not a potentate in Christendom possessed
of such a direful reputation as that monarch of
universal dominion commonly referred to -as the
King of Terrors. And yet no adequate reason
appears why death, as representing a natural law
and an essentially merciful operation, should in-
spire dread at its approach or grief for its effect.
Of course, when brought about by any painful or
untimely process death is always terrible in some
degree. Any outrage upon the laws of Nature
must bring in various form and extent disorder
and suffering as its consequence. But when death
appears as a natural relief to the burden of bodily
infirmities which invariably come upon old age,
it should be as welcome at the end of the present
life as the period of repose to a weary and toil-
worn traveller. The ancient Greeks and Romans
accustomed themselves to regard the cessation of
life as something so absolutely required by the
worn-out condition of the mind’s old tenement,
that they felt no alarm at its arrival in a natural
and orderly course. These people had no preachers
and doctrinarians to worry and disturb them with
a thousand idle and conflicting stories of a world
to come. They had no one to harrass and perplex
their minds with pictures of everlasting happi-
ness or everlasting torment, and without any
intermediate condition. Neither were those
Greeks and Romans liable at death’s ap-
proach to be importuned for money to be
spent in ceremonial prayers and incantations,
whereby the dying man’s passage to perpetual en-
joyment should be fully assured to him. In
truth these pagan peoples had no anxiety about
death, so far as such feeling referred to any ideas
of a life hereafter, inasmuch as they considered
the subject of future existence to be one which
not a single'-human -being could know anything
about. The inhabitants of the Polynesian Islands,
and other unchristianized territories, have also
awaited death at the naturally-appointed period,
quite undisturbed by speculations as to what was
to follow, and, like the ancient denizens of Rome
and Athens, could see nothing terrible in what
happened certainly to all, and came unto them as
rest to the weary. One of the most wonderfully
foolish usages of civilized humanity has appeared
in the costly treatment of dead bodies, and the
amount of display and attention lavished on the
mind-deserted tenement. In a few days after
death the human corpse, under average circum-
stances, becomes a mass of corruption, and in a
few years will fall to dust and be in no way dis-
tinguishable from any like remains of a beast of
the field. In time this residuum will be resolved
into certain elements, and become incorporated
with surrounding matter or dissipated in gases.
If the body referred to is buried near a tree
its constituent elements, converted by the
alchemy of nature into a fertilizing agency,
may be absorbed in the vegetable growth
and contribute to produce fruit or foliage,
which again will wither and fall, but only
to reappear in other forms of aniriial or vegetable
life. The worn-out body is in fact no more to the
animating principle which has quitted the dead
man than his worn-out clothes. And yet the de-
composing remains are placed in an expensive
cofiin and conveyed to the burying ground with
ostentatious solemnity, followed by relatives and
acquaintances looking appropriately sorrowful
while contemplating what they consider a fresh
victim to the King of Terrors. There appears to
be pretty commonly an idea in people’s minds that
something has been done for the advantage of the
deceased person, or-some meritorious action per-
formed, when the corpse has been paraded to the
grave-yard with special cost and ceremony; Very
often these funeral displays originate with a wish
to demonstrate the superior social standing of the
deceased person, and thereby gain a sort of con-
tingent consequence and reflected respectability*


When a highly world-renowned man is to be
buried there occurs a rare opportunity for self-
glorification under the strange pretext of rendering
honor to one who has passed beyond the reach of
all worldly distinction. Should the King of
Terrors visit the family of an ordinary citizen, and
remove a person of far advanced years and ex-
hausted vitality, the relatives and friends
of the departed put on mourning. In
this way the generally artificial and as-
sumed character of the grief is well represented—
it is something put on. It is, moreover, in such
cases the custom to darken the houses, wear a
look of affliction, and even garb the servants in
the livery of woe. In very superior society it is
also usual to define the period of this polite
mournfulness, and so there is a recognised in-
sincerity about this formal sorrow. And if ever
there arises with the bereaved ones any fear or
sadness of an unaffected" character, it is pretty
sure to proceed from being unpleasantly reminded
that th-' King of Terrors will one day claim them
for hio u.. n. The attendant mourners at a funeral
are generally supposed to believe that the de-
parted one has commenced a life of perfect and
perpetual happiness. The priest who “ performs”
the ceremony asserts that his dear brother, or
sister, has quitted this world in a “ sure and cer-
tain hope of eternal life ” —of course not a life of
torment. Do the friends of the deceased who
hear these words believe them true ? If so, why
should they be overwhelmed with grief because
the one they love is delivered from the sorrows
and sufferings of mundane existence, and trans-
lated to a new life of purity and peace, and joy
unspeakable ? All is hollow, vain, selfish, and
deceitful —of course in various degrees. What
we call death is but a sleep, a transformation and
renewal. Throughout Nature change is ceaseless—
constant motion is a law of the universe. As
night has been termed “ the death of each day’s
life,” so is the death of the body but a brief inter-
val of suspended animation between one life-time
of the mind and another. Death, in its peaceful
and natural order, ought to bring no terrors. Let
it be regarded, as it rightly should be, like a sweet
and gracious rest for the weary mind (as neces-
sary for the mental repose as the night’s slumber
for the refreshment of the body), and the “ King
of Terrors ” will have to abandon his character,
and stand forth as an angel of beneficence.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Debt ot Gratitude.
The great debt which Australia owes to England
is a thing which is not likely to be forgotten so
long as one dull-brained Tory remains to uprrar
his stupidity in the Upper House, or one third-
rate lawyer-shark survives to harangue the aggre-
gate drivel of a Primrose League. It was from
the kind old mother-land that New South Wales
borrowed her Governors, her gaols, and her gal-
lows, as well as a hanging-made-easy in the shape
of a legal code compiled in a barbarous age and
by a barbarous race, and to this day she clings to
these cherished souvenirs of her ancestors as ex-
ceedingly precious things. It was from England,
also, that she borrowed convicts to hang on the
borrowed gallows, to say nothing of ship-loads of
consumptives and other incurables, lords of shady
reputation, thieves, vagabonds, and pavement-
trotters, released from British prisons by kindly
magistrates on condition that they took their
unwholesome presence to the Antipodes, lunatics
and paupers, shoddy pants, and libraries of literary
abasement about the beauties of Imperialism.
Whatever England had to offer in the way of
vileness New South Wales has accepted, and
almost the only things which she has not borrowed
are those portions of the British code which re-
flect some faint gleam of justice and humanity.
The following extract from the latest-received
issue of Lloyd’s Newspaper shows how success-
fully, in some respects, New South Wales has
kept behind the country from which she ob-
tained the infamous half-cannibal code that now
disgraces her statute-book :
Juvenile Depravity at Uxbridge.—Seven boys, named
Arthur Groves, William Thorpe, Arthur;Jackman,
JositPH Peach Sadler, Henry West, George Hunt,
and James Sudbury, were charged with committing a
criminal assault on two girls, named Elizabeth Heather
and Frances Elizabeth Norris, girls under 13. The
evidence showed a shocking state of juvenile de-
pravity. All the parties lived at Uxbridge. Sad-
ler was acquitted; Hunt was sentenced to two
months’ hard labour; all the rest pleaded “ Guilty.” Groves
was sentenced to receive 12 strokes; Thorpe, 12 strokes ;
Jackman, to six weeks’ hard labour; West, to six weeks'
hard labour; and Sudbury, to 12 strokes. Mr. Justice
Stephen said it was to be regretted that the girls could not
also be punished.
In New South Wales these boys would have been
hanged amid a wild burst of public anathema,
and the two soiled doves who were the partners
of their misdoing would have been covered with
maudlin sympathy and maudlin tears, and testi-
moniallsed and subscriptioned and prayed over
and provided with new clothes, and wou'd have
received 18 offers of marriage apiece from 18 be-
sotted fools in the last stage of mental atrophy.
Watery-headed parsons would have preached
sermons about them, and they would have had a
benefit at the theatre, and a tribe of washy fos-
sils would have made poetry about them, and
then, while the dead bodies of their victims were
still hardly cold, their chief witnesses would have
passed forged cheques, and they would them-
selves have gone back to their native gutter with a
whoop, and left a host of fat-headed drivellers to
weep at their falling away. In New South Wales
they hang boys when they yield to the blan-
dishments of some dirty-minded siren in petticoats
and never wait to ask about the siren’s previous
character ; and then, by way of maintaining
the character of the blood-stained land of Upside-
Down, they flog old men of 65 for quoting the
shady parts of Scripture In the public streets.
The English Stephen, unlike his New South
Wales namesake, recognises that the birch is a
fitter punishment for a school-boy criminal than
execution or life-long imprisonment, smd that as a
childish punishment it is fib only for children ; but,
in Australia, it is almost entirely banished from the
public schools, and the law provides a gallows in
its stead. The new country has borrowed much
drivel and abasement from the old, and her loud-
mouthed loyalists are never tired of acknowledg-
ing the debt. If she would now coo sent to borrow
from an English judge a gleam of humanity and
common-sense, with which to enlighten the bar-
barous page of a code worthy of the dark ages of
the earth, she would, for once, owe a d ;bt of
gratitude to the land from which she has hitherto
received little to be thankful for.

A Niggers’ Mission.
The Maloga blackfellows have been conducting a
mission in Ballarat. There is fine sarcasm in
this. It is only four or five years ago since the
plate was continually passing round in the
churches to pay for the conversion of these same
sooty apostles. Then they were revelling on ’pos-
sum, grubs, and other such delicacies, and getting
mad-drunk on rum whenever they could beg or
steal it. Now they come In the odour of sanctity
and fat mutton to preach godliness to the very
people who paid for their conversion. We are
glad of it. It has always been our opinion that
Christianity was never intended for blaokfellows.
Its higher doctrines they are incapable of under-
standing, and the result is that they either turn
out oily-faced knaves with protuberant paunches
and one idea—to keep those paunches always
filled through the grace of the Loard— or poor,
spineless creatures with all the strength of sava-
gery taken out of them, and nothing but psalm-
singing and a belief in an eternal Hell put in its
place. We say they were better without Chris-
tianity. The indigenous religion of each race is
the one best suited to it, because that religion is
the result of the gradual mental growth of the
race. To thrust any other upon it is as absurd as
it would be to pour Queensland rum into a Vene-
tian glass or a Cellini goblet. We say again, we
are glad. The parsons will find some day that
they will be in the position of the Australian
tradesman—without work. The niggers and the
Chinese they have converted will turn the tables
—or rather the pulpits—on them, and we shall be
invaded by a horde of missionaries of every colour
and smell, from dirty-yellow to sooty-black, and
from pig-perfume to dead-dog smell, who will tell
us all about Hell over again with picturesque
variations. Then the parsons will wish they
had left them in their benighted heathen
state and start a White Preachers’ Union
when it is too late. But the fun will begin
in earnest when they start. They will go in for
no half-measures. Such shibboleths as “ Down
with Chinese Cheap Preaching,” “No more
Shoddy Gospel,” “ Heaven and Australia for the
White man, Hell and anywhere else for the China •
man and the Nigger,” “ Rally Round Us, We
Are Starving 1 ” will be the mildest they will use.
We hope to live long enough to see this come to
pass. It will be better than whlsky-and-milk
to us to see these smug-faced preachers who
prate about the brotherhood of man and lift their
voices in denunciation of any attempt to keep
our leprous brother from coming to our shores
and starving out the white and comparatively
clean-skinned brother of our blood—crying out for
poll-taxes on their black or yellow brother—es-
pecially If he be a Christian and a preacher. We
will watch with interest to see how the Christian
charity and brotherly love they talk so much of
now will stand that test. But we have said
enough. We will watch and pray and keep up
our spirits generally till that time conies.

A Military Partnership.
Victoria, according to Lord Carnarvon, has
undertaken a “ military partnership with Great
Britain,” and “ a share cf the labours and the
dangers of the mpire,” and New South Wales is
fast drifting towards the same abyss. An alleged
statesman, who is too old to fight, and who has
no character to lose by running away, has entered
with a light heart on a mission which is to make
the co'ony a sharer in the troubles that spring up
in Europe whenever a despotic dipsomaniac issues
his ukase of slaughter, and Australia, after a long
period of practical neutrality, can now claim the
dubious privilege of being a partner in the war-
scares that daily arise in the old Continent, Con-
sequently, the news that a barbarous horde is
gathering in Russian Poland acquires an unwonted
interest in Melbourne and Sydney. On the border
of Gallioia the air is thick with Tartar lances, and
all that is wanted is a word from the crowned
drunkard at St. Petersburg to send them across
the imaginary line that separates two Empires,
A single order issued by a monarch, whom cease-
less terror has rendered irresponsible, a single tick
of the telegraph, and all continental Europe will
be ablaze ; and, should that order be issued, it is
probable that England, dragging Australia in its
train, will shortly be in the thick of the fight.
When Russia and France on the one side, Austria,
Germany, and Italy on the other, are fill-
ing Europe with slaughter, the unspeakable
Turk will probably avail himself of the
opportunity to look after his lost provinces in
Bulgaria and Egypt, and thus lead Britain into
another sanguinary struggle on behalf of the
rapacious bondholders who boss the land of the
ancient Pharaohs. Or, again, the Czar’s abject
follower and ally, the Persian Shah, may think
the opportunity a favourable one for sattling old
scores with his old enemies of Afghanistan ; or,
leaving these risks out of tl e account, there still
remains the danger that England, ruled as it is
by Germans and German sympathisers, may take
a hand at the instance of its foreign Queen on be-
half of the sauer-kraut tribes beyond the Rhine.
Or, should she decline to help the Fatherland in
Its hour of trouble, the Germans may afterwards
revenge themselves on what they will probably
regard as a faithless friend by high handed aggres-
sions in Greater Britain, similar to those which
they have so recently perpetrated in hapless
Samoa. The barbarous host now gathered in
Russian Poland carries with its banners a thou-
sand dangers to the mother-country, and Aus-
tralia, by an act of unparalleled insanity, dec’ares
to the world that she is ready and anxious to
take a share in them all. All over the wide
expanse of four continents British interests are
involved, and the smallest tribal skirmish may
carry in its train new complications and new
dangers, and Australia asks nothing better than
the privilege of being dragged into every
quarrel that may arise throughout the scat-
tered Empire whenever an inebriated Czar,
a semi-imbecile Sultan, or a pauper Bat-
tenberg breaks out into hostilities for the sake
of a general European lark. Inflated with the
glory which she won when her troops blundered
among the baggage-waggons in the Soudan, and
caught a glimpse of one bed-ridden Arab through
a telescope, New South Wales, by the mouth of
Parkbs, tells Russia and all the rest of the world
to come on. To-day a new war seems to be loom-
ing, and amid a multitude of foreign complica-
tions it is just possible that the army of savages
gathered on the plains of Poland may carry with
it the answer to Parkes's challenge.

In 1886, according to Mr. Coghlan, the imports
of New South Wales amounted to £20,973,548,
and the exports to £15,556,21.3, which means that
the colony went in debt to the extent of more
than fire millions in a single year. But the
Government statistician doesn’t put it that way.
For 30 years New South Wales has regularly
bought more than she has sold, but the result, it
seems, is merely due to the “ importation of loan
money for the development of the natural re-
sources of the country,’’ and shows—good heavens!
—the “great purchasing power of the people.”
On the whole, we like this way of putting it.
New South Wales, after a long spell of Freetrade,
finds herself compelled to buy almost all her
manufactured goods, and a vast quantity of
butter, grain, potatoes, timber, hay, and the like,
from foreign countries, and can’t raise enough to
pay for them, but when she purchases her food
with borrowed cash, she is merely “ importing
money for the development of the natural re-
sources of the country.” Sometimes, when we
have been very hard up, we have gone to the
Moses in the next street and imported money to
develope our own natural resources, and when he
had advanced us 30s. on our grandfather’s watch,
we manifested a purchasing power which sur-
prised people who had never known us before on
a cash basis. But we hadn’t Mr. Coghlan’s
powers of expression, and consequently we didn t
brag about the transaction in a book, and draw
up elaborate tables to show how much more we
spent than we earned, and how prosperous we
were in consequence. In fact, we never thought
of it, and a great chance was thus thrown away.
*
The New South Wales Government being deter-
mined on retrenchment, all the Ministers might
advantageously follow the example of the Minis-
ter of Education, Inglis, and make each officer,
be he big or little, pay his share of the expense of
cleaning and warming the premises wherein
he discharges his duties. “Tiger” Inglis com-
pels teachers, whose salaries range from £3B to
£lOO per year, to pay for the cleaning of schools
used by others than themselves, and for firewood
to warm the shivering urchins of Monaro and
Kiandra. But, in the Southern districts, the Minis-
ter for Lands provides his white lambs with fire-
wood and a man to cut and carry it, and patent
stoves to burn it in. These same curled darlings
have also their offices cleaned and swept daily,
and a flower-garden cultivated for their special
delectation—all at Government expense. How is
thi a , Mr. Gabkett? Are not your “gentlemen”
clerks, agents, Inspectors, surveyors, and draughts-
men, with big salaries and “ makings,” as well
able to pay for cleaning and warming the offices
they work in as the poorly-paid provisional school-
teacher is for the like in her scholars’ school 2
The Bulletin has a radical and unanswerable
objection to urge against the Parkes National
Testimonial scheme. It asserts that no man
should accept tip of any sort while holding office
as a Minister of the Crown. It is a rule of the
Civil service throughout Australia that a railway
porter may not accept gratuities from the public,
inasmuch as acceptance would lead not only to
undue preference being given to such railway pas-
sengers as paid tribute, but also to corresponding
disabilities beitg inflicted upon travellers who
might refuse to yield backsheesh. If this argu-
ment be held good as against a lowly, tip taking
State-paid railway-porter, does it not also hold
good as against a personage occupying the high
and mighty State paid office of Premier 2 Suppose,
for example, that a man who had publicly sub-
scribed a large amount in aid of a testimonial of
the “ National Tribute ” order were under sen-
tence of death, is it not reasonable to suppose
(applying to the statesman the argument by
which the railway porter is bound) that the
statesman might be consciously or unconsciously
influenced in his vote at the Executive table by a
remembrance of the culprit’s liberality ? On the
other hand, supposing that a man were in the
condemned cell who had ostentatiously and offen-
sively, and under circumstances calculated to
throw discredit on the testimonial scheme, refused
to subscribe thereto, might not the statesman’s
judgment in regard to his case be biassed by a re-
collection of the affront 2 The Bulletin, "while
holding that, though it would be fair for a retiring
Minister to accept a money-vote made by the
Legislature in a deliberate and constitutional way,
believes that this present testimonial business
strikes a deadly blow at the very foundation of
decent Government.
♦
It is alleged by the Parkes' Tribute Fund Com-
mittee, in an advertisement, that the Honorable
Geoffrey Eagar has contributed £5 to the
Parkes’ “national” testimonial. Now, the
Honorable Geoffrey Eagar lately became bank-
rupt, and, contrary to the ordinary rule of the
service, he was allowed to retain his official posi-
tion. He has, so far as the public are aware, not
yet paid his creditors in full. Have not Mr.
Bagar’s creditors at least as much right to this
£5 as the (also insolvent) Sir Henry Parkes, and
is it a decent act for the Premier of New South
Wales to accept £5 from an official in Mr, Eagar s
circumstances 2 Further, is it a decent act for
the permanent head of the New South Wales
Treasury to subscribe a not inconsiderable sum to
a political testimonial, and thus indirectly put the
screw upon junior officers with small salaries, who
may be most scrupulous with respect to the dis-
charge of their private obligations 2 Will Premier
Parkes be so shameless as to accept the Honor-
able Geoffrey Eagar’s £5 2 However, there
is perhaps, after all, another way of looking
at this matter. “ Honour,” said Premier Parkes
on a now memorable occasion, “ does not consist
in paying 20s. in the £.” Example Is even better
than precept.

Last Thursday, a deputation from the Victorian
Presbyterian Assembly waited upon Lord Car-
narvon and drivelled about the unjust goings-on
of the French in the New Hebrides. In any case,
the idiocy of addressing a statesman out of office
on the policy of a great power, would be apparent
to any but a Presbyterian mind. But, in this case,
the situation was made especially ridiculous by
the snobbish way in which it was worked up
Lord Carnarvon was shown into the Governor s
private-room at the old Treasury building, and
stuck into the Governor’s official chair, sur-
mounted by a gilt crown, while Duncan Gillies
craved permission to introduce to him the holy
land-sharks who want to snavel the New Hebrides
in the name of the Loard. This is about a
best-on-record in the way of title-worship—
for a globe-trottirg Earl of no present offi-
cial standing whatever to be waited upon
cap in hand, by the Premier of a colony which he
happens to be visiting. No paper in Australia has
lashed red tapeism with a heavier hand than has
The Bulletin, but to our mind there was a
miserable lack of official dignity about Duncan
Gillies' proceeding on Thursday. How idle to
talk about an Australian spirit of independance,
when the Premier of our most assertive colony
delights to prostrate himself before a British peer.
And such meaningless prostration I Lord Carnar-
von had nothing to say—what could he have 2
to his idolaters, and when he rose from his crown-
embellished chair the New Hebrides question re-
mained as unanswerable as ever.

The 60-per cent, pawnshop, the Australian Bank-
ing Company,- directed by Hon. Francis Abigail,
New South Wales Minister for Mines, has found
a defender at last. John Haynes puts in a plea
on its behalf. The qualifications of such an ad-
vocate to hold a brief for such a client are un-
doubted. “ The institution,” we read in the Sun-
day sheet which Mr. Haynes edits, “ is in every
respect a people’s bank,” With some reservations,
we entirely agree with this statement. It is a
bank for the people with gold chains and hook
noses who receive the most of its profits ; it is a
bank for the people who like to pay, say, 30 per
cent., with a sliding-scale of commission added ;
it is a bank just as any Jew pawnshop charging
sixty or two hundred and sixty per shent is a bank.
It is not a bank as far as the necessity of registering
statements of its position is jconcerned, and it Is
not a bank to the extent of Its business in loaning
at 60 per shent on the flat-irons and furniture of
the unfortunate. It trades on the pretence alleged
in its title, but it is as much a bank as a Jew’s
harp is an orchestra or a fly-wheel is a locomotive.
Some day when we have time to fill a large con-
tract we intend to write an article on the beauties
and advantages of being an ass in New South
Wales, especially as instanced in the case of Mr.
Pruen of Bathurst, the embezzler with the in-
fluential father. When Dr. Cortis, M.P., led
Attorney-General Wise out into the back.yard,
and propped that eminent lawyer against the
pump, and put the matter before him in various
lights, he represented this patient as a semi-
imbecile boy who, from the sheer stupidity of his
badly-manured intellect, took somebody else’s cash, ■
and “ walked off along the road to Rockley,” but
it now transpires that the wailing infant was a
good pianist and singer, a remarkably cute card-
player, and generally a flash young man who was
six feet long and £4B short ; and that when ho
made his famous retreat along the road to Rockley
he carried with him an assumed name and a
loaded revolver, and was prepared for bloodshed.
On the other hand Henry Lewis, of Sydney, who
also suffered from incoherence of the cash, was
smaller and younger and more imbecile than the
fortunate Fruen, and had no revolver, no in-
fluential father, no member to tell the Attorney-
General on the quiet what a fool he was, and
didn’t walk off anywhere, and yet he is In gaol
and nobody bothers about him. There are things
in this world which no fellah can understand.
+
It has been stated that Trafalgar-square is the
property of the Crown, and the Homo Secretary
considers that the Board of Works has power to
close it. This beautifully exemplifies the differ-
ence between a Republican and an Imperial form
of government. In the latter, the people are not
the State. The State consists of those who rule.
They conserve what the people pay for. From
the taxes wrung from the lower orders properties
are acquired which they never enjoy. To one
section of the community is permitted the glorious
privilege of buying and ornamenting and beauti-
fying and keeping in magnificent repair ‘ ‘ the
finest square in Europe”—which, however, is
carefully closed to them when it suits the caste
interests of the other section which claims to re-
present the Crown. According to this doctrine,
as all the land of England is either private
property or the property of the Crown, the land-
less pauper has no right to put down the sole of
his foot for five minutes anywhere. In fact, it is
a genuine and remarkable kindness on the part of
the authorities to allow him even to walk over
the ground which he pays for, but which, when it
suits them, they claim as the property of the
Crown. The landless pauper has nothing for it
but to jump into the sea. We sometimes, in this
so-called enlightened age, pretend that the Queen
no longer rules as a person. We talk about the
State being the people. Yet what do we mean
when we talk of the property of the Crown ? We
clearly do not mean the property of the State in
the sense of the People.
To England.

HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
The New South Wales Corps ruled the
colony either directly or indirectly from the de-
parfcure of Phillip to tho deposition of Bligb.
Major Grose and Captain Patterson were lieu-
tenant-governors until the arrival of Hunter, in
1795. In those three years the corps solidified its
position, until it became strong enough, in 1808, to
put*Bligh under arrest. Shortly afterwards the
corps was drummed out of the colony in disgrace,
and ordered to England and thence to India as a
“ condemned regiment.” But the officers did not
go to India, Having led their men into mischief
they deserted the colours, turned their backs on
their followers, and, on resigning the commis-
sions they had disgraced, remained behind in the
colony and founded our “ first families.”
* * *
We have said that the officers looked upon
the purchase of their commissions as a trade in-
vestment. They wcre nearly all keen men, hut it
was wiih the keenness of the huckster. They saw
tho misery about them, the degraded condition of
their victims, and the r own great power ; and
they proceeded to use this last to make money out
of the other two. Not one snark cf generous or
even common human sympathy with the state of
things they saw around them brightens their dark
and squalid record. With incredible callousness
to the most pitiable forms of misery they fattened
and prospered on the filth of the time as the
raven go ges itself on the carrion. It would bs
too Arcadian to expect any manly pretest from
such creatures as these, against the Iniquities of
the convict system. It was distinctly to their in-
terest, as tending to lessen the chances of com-
mercial competition, that these God-forsaken
people should he mercilessly ground down. The
writer who would attempt to candidly describe
the phenomenally sinister character of the officers
of this picked corps, would lay himself open to the
charge of aiming at the creation of a mere vulgar
sensation. It is safer, therefore, to let their acts
speak for themselves.
* * *
No one will be surprised to learn that the
chief article of trade with thesa uniformed
traders was rum. “ The rum-selling corps is
the glorious title they have carried on the flam-
ing scroll of history. Few historic titles have
been earned so well. The settlement reeked with
ruffian!sen and rum.
Rum was a recog-
nized medium of ex-
change. Wages for
labour, the price of
farm produce, and
every other transac-
tion for Which money
usually serves, were
paid in rum. This
was a traffic quite
after the officers’ own
hearts. They entered
on it with enthusi-
asm, bought up all
the rum they could
lay their hands on,
and retailed it at
ruinous prices to the
settlement. Lawless-
ness and disorder en-
sued, and successive
Governors wrote
home for advice. Jfn-
structions were issued
from Whitehall, forbidding all officers, civil
and military, from selling any spirituous
liquors to the convicts or settlers. Bub
she authorities might have saved their breath.
For the officers procured licenses for their non-
commissioned officers, for ex-convicts, and for
those of their own men who could be trusted.
Governor Hunter considered the trade as “highly
disgraceful to men who hold in their hands a com-
mission signed by His Majesty.” And so, no
doubt, it was. But everything was disgraceful,
and this was of a piece with the rest.
* * *
It would be a difficult thing to say who
did not sell rum in the settlement. The line can
only be drawn at those who were incapacitated
by drinking it. Dr. Balmain, whose duty it was
as a magistrate to sentence men to be cut to
pieces by the lash for absorbing too much rum—
and the records show that he did his duty-had at
one time, when a fitful effort was made to restrict
the officers’ traffic, upwards of 11,000 gallons of
spirits in his house ! There were also a few
chests of tea and some hale goods -truly a
plentiful lack of bread to such an intolerable deal
of sack ! Mr. D’Arcy Wentworth had 3000
gallons. They offered to sacrifice it in deference
to the new Order, at twenty shillings a gallon.
But the farcical nature of all attempts to stop the
lucrative traffic is shown by such instances as the
following One day a ship arrived from Manilla,
being described as carrying cattle to the settle-
ment. There were two head of stock on board.
But there were also 7203 gallons of spirits. The
Governor forwarded a copy of his Order to the
master, bidding him land his two cows and take
the spirits away. But this was entirely too infan-
tile a suggestion ; the master reported that his
vessel was unfit to put to sea; and, adds the
Governor, “ under the circumstances, and the un-
popularity of preventing the spirits from being
illicitly appropriated and consumed, I allowed of
Its being disposed of and distributed in the usual
manner ” For ama zing artfulness, both in matter
and style, this minute excels anything ever pro-
jected by Captain Cuttle.
* *
It ia a fact that each officer had his per-
mission to land rum in quantities proportioned to
his rank. This was sold up to £1 par gallon. A
farmer has been known to give an acre cf wheat,
which would maintain him a year, for two gallons
of spirits. When the officers sent their agents to
purchase wheat from the settlers they took, not
money, but rum. A bottle which cost the officer
half-a-crown, we are told, would buy two or
three bushels of wheat. The settlers began to
distil the most infernal intoxicants from wheat,
peaches, and other things. Barrington, the
famous pick-pocket, turned thief-catcher, ex-
plains that a bushel of wheat, which might be
worth ten stillings, would produce five gallons of
deleterious spirit at six shillings per gallon. The
chief constable of Sydney had a licence to sell
rum : and, as Dr. Lang puts it, “ the chief gaoler
although not exactly permitted to convert the gaol
into a grog-shop, had a licensed house in which
he sold ium publicly on his own behalf, right op-
posite the gaol door.”
* * *
The officers, unblushing, made use of their
power for trade purposes, and to secure the com-
mand of the market they entered into an infamous
bond binding themselves to treat, through two of
their number, with the captains of veseeis, for
the pui chase of their merchandise, to the exclu-
sion of any person outside their own ring. They
had the privilege of being the first to board ves-
sels arriving in the harbour. But they knew each
other too well to trust to the mere word of honour
of such British officers as they were They insti-
tuted a £lOOO forfeit for anyone of their number
who might attempt to effect a purchase without
the connivance of his fellows. This flagrant con-
spiracy gave them the command of the buying
market, and left them at liberty to fix their own
retail prices. It might be thought that the
generous, free spirit of tlio British soldior would
have made a muddle of such closely-calculated
commercial arrangements. But these old tailors
and shoemakers, staymakers, and man-milliners
were not that kind of soldier. The outcry of the
inhabitants toon showed this. They were ever-
lastingly memorialising, petitioning, and remon-
stratirg with the Governor for allowing the day-
light robbery to go on. But, as a rule, the
Governors knew better than to interfere in any
serious mood. When one of their number did try
to make a stand the gentlemen of the New South
Wales Corps arose in their indignation, created
what they called a great popular upheaval against
the horrid tyranny that oppressed the groaning
masses, and, rushing the Governor’s bedroom with
a horde of armed and drunken myrmidons, they
fiehed Bligh out from under a bed and summarily
locked him up 1
• * *
The thoroughly business-like principles on
which these officers fleeced the tettlement may
be gathered from a few facts. When Hunter ar-
rived, after three years’ direct rule by the corps,
the Reverend Mr. Johnson, chaplain of the settle-
ment, preached a little sermon, in which he ex-
posed the government of the officers, “ Their
extortion, their despotism, their deoauchery, and
ruin of the colony, driving it almost to ruin by
BAjsm|
fg
the sale of goods at 1200 per cent, profit; he con-
gratulated the settlement on the abolition of the
military government.’ He might well do so, but
it was not abolished yet. An extract from Holt s
Memoirs is worth quoting
“Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, when a soldier
came to him for bis month's pay, would usually
accost him with, ‘ Well, what do you want ?’
“ ‘ I want to be paid, sir,’ the soldier would say.
“‘What will you have?’ was always Captain
Kemp's answer. 4 1 have very good tobacco, ten
shillings the pound, and good tea at twenty shil-
licgs the pound, prints at eight shillings a yard ’
and so or.
“If the poor soldier answered, Sir, Ido rot
want any of your goods,’ the Captain’s comment
was, 4 You don’t 1 you are a darr ned saucy rascal!
Perhaps then the soldier would say, 4 Sir, if you
please, give me halt money and half goods.’ But
this proposal was equally objectionable to Captain
Kemp, and generally led to bis thundering out,
4 Begone, you damned mutiniu* scoundrel, rr IJI
send you to the guard-house and have you flogged
for your impertinence to your officer.’ ”
44 This was the manner,” summarises Holt, that
these people made their fortunes, by the oppres-
sion and extortion of the soldier, the settler, and
the poor.”
* * •
A select committee of the Commons on
transportation in 1812 brought out a mass of infor-
mation on oath which abundantly proves the
worst that has been said about the New South
Wales Corps. Such a picture of wanton rapacity,
unbridled greed, and barefaced robbery of pri-
soners by their gaolers—robbery under its most
repulsive form—was never disclosed on oath
before.
The muddle-headed bowelless British Tory of the
present day w r eeps bitterly as he sees the old land-
marks disappearing one by one, but the ancient
consecrated steal which is carried on under the
name of “perpetual pensions” has so far escaped
the vandal hand of the reformer, and, at a time
when more than a million of Britons are suffering
from actual starvation, a sum of £1,313,260 per
annum goes in annual gratuities to the rich.
Among the noble thieves who divide the plunder
are the representatives of the Dutchman, Schom-
BBRGt, who was shot by his own soldiers at the
Boyne 200 years ago. He had a pension of £lOOO
a year, and he left no heirs. But some collateral
descendant of his grandmother scrambled for the
money, and the daughter of his second cousin s
husband’s wife by her first marriage sailed in, and
his remote half-uncle multiplied by a hundred
dozen showed up also, and finally the dead fraud s
pension was divided among them. Their de-
scendants axe drawing it yet I This is part of the
beautiful Imperial system which Parkhs and
Gillies are so anxious to extend to Australia,
and which Tankerville Bennet, of the Prim-
rose League, spread himself so nobly to support,
until a dismal fate sent him away to aid in
spreading the Gospel among unwashed offsprings
with neglected noses and dubious pinnies in the
New South Wales back-blocks.
Sir John Robertson alleges that because
N.S.W. sent men, horses, guns, &c., to the
Soudan to fight against blackfellowa, the colony
has a right to be called Australia. There is a
'slight error, Sir John. It was Dailey who sent
them. Therefore, Dailey should be re-named
Australia.

The Sydney hotelkeepers are complaining

reason.
A French poet has described interest as
“ the aroma of capital." This being so, the Aus-
tralian Banking Company, were it to take a walk
up King-street, Sydney, would leave behind it an
odour that would remind the passers-by of—well,
the much-patchoulid ladies one meets out very
late at night.
Mr. William Dymock, bookseller, of
Sydney, has just purchased in England Gould’s
rare and valuable book-“ The Birds of Aus
tralla for £250. He has also paid £5O for
“ Gould’s Australian Mammals.” The work first-
named is, perhaps, the most valuable book ever
imported to Australia.
The Sydney D.T. stated recently that Mr.
Dibbs, ex-Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales,

going into court —with a £25,000 libel action.
The Referee.
The Sydney team in the late cricket-
matoh consisted of eighb players and three pas-
sengers.

The Sydney Association Cricket Ground
is slowly, but surely, descending into Utile better
than a gambling-hell. A notice prohibiting bet-
ting is posted in the pavilion, but It does not
appear to extend to the Grand-Stand Reserve,
which, at the big matches, is fairly Infested with
betting-men, from the “ leviathans ” down to the
very smartest of the “ rats.” The wagering Is nob
confined to the result of the match, or even indi-
vidual scores, for no sooner dr es the ball leave the
bat from a powerful hit than a babel of raven
cries goes up offering to bet it reaches the fence, or
vice versa. And the authorities calmly look on
and make no sign.
* •
Surely we have now seen the last of
Burton behind the wickets? Personal friendship
should not influence the Selection Committees.
• • *
That Britisher rather gave himself away
when he stated, at Parramatta, that the Sydney
Association Ground had been tampered with for
their innings, for the Noozk man happened to be
within earshot. Only another phase of British
fair play.

The yachts Waibangi and Carina were
put up to auction in Sydney last week, but sales
were not effected. The Waitangi was passed in
at £675, and the Carina followed suit at £320.

The dailies still continue to give Australia
away to the world in speaking of Kemp as the
champion sculler. Is it not the height of ridicu-
larity, as Mrs, Partington would observe, to speak
in all seriousness or Kemp as “ Champion? ’
Beach’s ac’ion in trying to keep the plucky little
Hanlan out in the cold is a contemptible finish to
an honest rowing career, and has recoiled on him
by building up for the Canadian wide-spread sym-
pathy, and, st’ll more to the point, a big hatful of
sovereigns.

Hutchens went under to Gent recently in
England, in a 120 yards match for the Champion-
ship and an alleged £2OO. The raca is spoken of
as being a genuine affair, Gent winning by three
quarters of a length, after a desperate struggle in
11| sec.

It was understood that Ted Evans was
picked in the team as a change bowler. This
could not have been the case, however, as he was
nob even tried. If Selection-Committees will in-
sist upon picking him, the “Fakir” should have
the good sense to stand out and give place to
younger and better-performed men.

The English skipper’s excellent display in

not be surprised even if Foley wins, as he has

Our old friend Benzon, (he “Jubilee
Juggins," was the original cause of Lord Ailes
bury’s trouble. The “rorty” nobleman intended
to run his horse, Everitt, “fair and honest," but
found that Juggins had taken all the book* about
it. Then the jockey received orders to pull
Everitt, and his lordship commissioned certain
men to “go a-milking.” In the end, as every-
body knows, the horse wasn’t pulled sufficiently
and Juggins won his bets. Bub it is noticeable
that Ailesbury was hauled over the coals for a
trick which some of his judges had played the
Yankee Walton, when that plunger was forestall-
ing them, some years ago. If any other swell had
made a similar arrangement for getting at an in-
terloping backer, the Jockey Club would have
voted ib quite the thing. This Ailesbury incident
is probably accountable for Benzon’s expressed
determination to back only bis own horses for tte
future.
• * *
The Yanks appear to have claimed Jack
Burke as their own, and he comes to us as the
“ famous American boxer.” Burke was born in
Ireland, and reared in England, where he re-
mained until four years ago. If Beach is Aus-
tralian then the new arrival is most distinctly an
Englishman.
• * *
The Bulletin was not very wide of the
mark in writing up the peculiar power of Shrews-
bury’s team to get any other eleven men out for a
moderate total on a batting wicket. And again
we say that therein lies the superiority of the best
English professional cricket. To talk of altering
the rules of the game so as to give bowlers a
better chance is pure bosh, while a flrst-clasa
eleven can be put through for 119 runs in fine
weather after winning the toss.

Shrewsbury is sorry to hear that Lord

Eighteen juniors made a miserable show
in Melbourne against the M.C.C.’s Englishmen.
The youngsters were not selected with a strict

fizzle. The few hundreds who turned up on

and applauding Stoddart each time he was missed-
And they missed him, ye gods! with a monotony
that was truly comic.

There was a dense crowd at Sydney Royal
on Saturday night, “ La Fille du Tambour Major”
being the attraction of the evening. After a vain
effort to sit down on a seat which wasn’t there
because somebody else was already sitting on it,
we were graciously permitted by the management
to hang on to the unreachable with both hands
ani make notes with our feet, while the wild pro-
cession of nuns and military passed before ns in
review. The pl*t of the opera hasn’t altered to any
appreciable extent since we helped to sib on its
head in the happy days of yore; the heroine
booms along just as she did in our infancy, and,
in years to come, when the present writer dies
and retires to his eternal rest, he will probably
leave her still booming, and nob growing any
older. Miss Colbourne-Baber, as Stella, plays
laboriously well, and if her vocal cart-wheel were
greased ever so little —if her bark upon the sea of
melody were nob quite so hoarse —she would be
laboriously better. Miss Aggie Kelton, who has
really a pretty little voice, scooped the pool as
Griolob; our old friend of the erratic legs,
Bambini (W. H. Warner), and Captain Wobert (Mr.
Woodfleld) were as active as two bags of cats ;
the myoptic Duke and the much-married Duchess
—though why a female Duke shouldn’t be a plain
Dukess we can’t imagine—prospered pretty well
In the hands of Mr. Benham and Miss Sophie
Harris, and Knight Aston was the same glorious
old fellow as before, and probably the beat of the
crowd. The ladies of the Royal company are
all beautiful and young—in fact, not one of them
is over 30, or has been over it any time during the
last 50 years, and probably 40 years hence the last
of them will die at the age of 28,
** ♦ #
There is a sound at Her Majesty’s (Sydney)
as It a gilt and painted cow were trying to geo
her hind foot out of the mud, and the Forty
Thieves were howling for a mutton-chop. A lot
of dreary old gags have been hashed together and
served up as a new drama amid a wilderness of
hippopotamus-blnsh scenery and a crowd of
people who couldn't have lived, even if they tried,
and who wouldn’thave beenanyuseif they had. The
vlcked squire who abducts the virtuous maiden
that is engaged to the yonng man of poor but
honest parents, is the main feature of the story,
and the only difference is that the Squire is moved
Into Russia and made a Governor, and the drama
is called “ Siberia.” A massacre of Jews in the
second act and the awkward circumstance that the
young lover can’t get a cup of tea because the
kettle has capsized into the stove, and the stove
has overturned on the cat, and the oat has fled
with a swollen tail into the crockery, can hardly
ba termed redeeming features. Tne hero is a
Nihilist and a blower-up of things in general; and,
accompanied by a cook, who strikes for liberty
with a rod-hot poker, he keeps 70 rioters at bay.
About the sixth act the narrative loses
its shoes and goes hopelessly off its
feed. Several escaped convicts die among the
snow, and the relentless pursuer comes up and puts
tobacco-juice or something on their graves;
a conspirator goes off his head on a mountain-
peak and lies down with his cold feet against his
own back; Mr. J. Parkes plays “ Leuohtkaferln ”
softly in the orchestra, and the audience thank
Providence that he doesn’t play “ Bxghdkfbykz-
mnbgx ” or some other neck-breaking anthem as
well; then there ensues a scene at Odessa; a
Governor in disguise rushes about pardoning
everybody, promoting everybody to be a duke,
cursing everybody, and putting everythingsquare;
yells from the gallery, loud applause, screams,
policemen, beautiful scenery, noble sentiments
from George Rignold, hi-j ah! a-chew! and we
fall over a Chinaman in our efforts to get out.
We started for home at last in an omnibus, and
the wheel came off en route. As we fell out we
grabbed hold of the prettiest girl in the vehicle
and told her we would sea her home, but she
shook us off derisively, and we were left lying in
the road. Tne redeeming features of “ Siberia ”
consist of Messrs. Sterling Whyte, and Greville,
who are excellent In two somewhat ridiculous
characters: George Rignold, who plays a noble
and manly part, overlaid, thanks to the miserable
author, with the frantic heroism of a stage pirate,
and Miss Kate Bishop, who is charming right
through, and who, fortunately, has less aged gags to
utter than the majority of her companions. A few
others who are not exactly redeeming features
may stand over till next week.

The ladies’ committee of the Sharkes
Tribute Fund have lately circularised the various
theatrical managers of Sydney, soliciting benefits
in aid of their scheme—the last and most Indecent
move in an exceedingly indecent business. In
the past Parkes has treated the theatrical mana-
gers and lessees in a most arbitrary and uncertain
manner, and as he is at present the person in
whom the power of granting or withholding the-
atrical licenses is vested, and whose authority is
so extensive that he can close up any theatre at
five minutes’ notice, it follows—well, it follows
that the theatrical profession, remembering all
these things and being only hnman after all, will
respond much more liberally than they would
were the benefit on account of plain Henry
Sharkes, the distressed ex-member of Parliament
who could find no place save lenterflald to rest
his head. To cadge for benefits in aid of an
official who holds the theatrical manager in the
hollow of his hand is mean to the last degree.
Why don’t the Ladies’ Tribute Committee at
once invite the poor theatre-man to come and kiss
them, not under the Christmas mistletoe, but
under the sword of Damocles ? Suppose now that
a theatrical manager had a case depending in the
Supreme Court before Chief Justice Darley, and
suppose that Chief Justice Darley suddenly got
hard np. Suppose further that a benefit were
being organised for the C.J., and the managers
were asked to contribute—how would that look ?
Does anybody imagine for a single instant that
any judicial-minded person would accept a benefit
under such conditions? But then, bless you,
Parkes doesn’t know what the ladies of the com-
mittee are doing. He “never reads the news-
papers."

The bobtailed mediocrity of “ Leah ” has
been running all last week at Sydney Criterion, and
Mias Essie Jenyns, in a senes of paralysing attitudes
and a state of constant terror, is about at her
worst. If this is the real Miss Jenyna, and the
Miss Jenyns whom we have admired so often as
Rosalind, Beatrice, &0., is only a counterfeit, then
another bright vision has faded away, bub if the
divine Essie, who is now breaking herself up into
angles such as no man ever saw before, is not the
genuine charmer of our dreamt, we caa only ask
that she should becoma herself again as soon as
possible. If Bill Holloway would only invest in
a club and hit the sickly drama of “Leah" on
the head for good and all he would ba guilty of a
public benefaction. P.S.—Miss Jenyns takes a
farewell benefit on the loth Inst.

The only Miccaba filled Sydney Academy
to the door on Saturday night. The chief novelty
of the evening was a wild and awful one-man
melodrama in which Mr. Maocabs represented
the heavy fiend of romance in a lovely fashion
that should make one or two sledge-hammer actors
we know of come outside and look at themselves.
It would do them a lob of good.

At Sydney Gaiety, Mr. Dampier announces
the last nights of the present season. The “ Night
Birds ” have been moulting on the stage once
more, and “East Lynne” and “His Natural
Life” will fill the bill till Monday. The last-
named, in Mr. Dampier's hands, is always a re-
liable success. By the way, Mr. Dampier’s
talented daughter. Rose, who has a capital soprano
voice, and bids fair to become an accomplished
public singer, made a
most effective debut at
Madame Fabris’ pupils’
concert last week.

Johnny Cowan’s new
gag at Sydney Alhambra
brings down the house.
Paddy—we beg pardon—
Perry Ryan, in his song
“ Where have you bean ?”
put that question to each
of the company, receiving
some funny answers in
reply. When Johnny’s
turn came, he replied:
“ I have been acting like
a flat, going round with
the hat for Parkes’
tribute, but got nothing
for that.” At which
wretched doggerel the
house yelled.
# * *
A sweltering multi-
tude filled Melbourne
Alexandra on Saturday
to hear Simonson’s com-
pany ting “Maritana ”’in
choice Italian. An opera
so well understanded
of the people would gee
in any language except
Chinese, and, so far as
the eternal fitness of
things is concerned,
there’s no reason why
the Ring of Spain and
his subjects shouldn’t
prefer the native tongue
of Qaribaldi to that of
’Enery Parkes. Any-
how “Maritana” ap-
peared to give large satis-
faction in its novel form.
When nothing in particu-
lar was being warbled
the public mopped their
fevered brows with damp
handkerchiefs which they
waved into a dry state
again after each well-
known air. It is no figure
of speech to say that the
shilling pit (which is the
Alexandra’s very back-
-bone) rose at Lazzarini
after he expressed his
desire to fall like a sold ier.
Not that all warriors
fall in the same way, we
must remember. Some
fall with their faces to the
foe, especially when the
foe is all round ’em, but
instlncD prompts most
men to expand their backs
for the ball if they sus-
pect the ball is travelling
in their direction. Sig-
nora Rabottaro made a
melodious fair-haired gipsy, Plmazzonl and Buzzl
were in grand voice, and Don Jose and the King,
and Cavalleri’s Lazarillo were pleasant to hear, see,
and think about. Singing all round made amends
for a want of life in the action. Ic is the fashion
with us Inanimate Anglo-Saxons to speak of
Southern Europeans as “ born actors.” We ac-
cept their shrugs and fiery gestures as flashes of
histrionic genius. Bat Saturday’s show made it
evident that an Italian company can’t flash much
born-acting into an opera which hasn’t been care-
fully rehearsed. “Ernani” Is given one night
this week, and on Saturday that giddy “ Traviata ”
puts in her first appearance.
# * * *
The Triumvirate, in their anxiety to pro-
mote high art of every description, have engaged
a couple of female Blondins to frolic on a wire
cable, fixed up somewhere near the roof of Mel-
bourne Royal. So, after the four-act drama,
“ First Class,” has run its awful course, Ella
Zuilla and Little Lulu do a lot of hoary business
which the famous Frenchman wore threadbare in
the long ago. Ella Zuila is a fine figure of a mus-
cular lady and Little Lulu is a neat young thing,
and they are both fearfully clever, individually
and together. But as a netting stretched over
the stalls obviates the possibility of any sudden
death there isn't much enthusiasm slung about
after the intrepid females have been trot-
ting along in mid-air for ten minutes.
The show outlives wonderment, and seems
out of its element at the Royal. But it
should go well with Pain's fireworks, which are
just now drawing their thousands every fine
night. “School for Scandal” finishes at the
Bijou this week, if it isn’t kept on for another six
nights in answer to numerous requests, yerknow.
“ Pinafore,” as presented at the Princess’s, strikes
one as being out of touch with the times. Ids
humour has run to seed, and its airs sound
h»mny. Miss Braham, recovered from her throat
attack, falls to help things along materially, and
altogether there is some long felt want for some-
thing or other at this toney establishment. Per-
haps Nellie Stewart could fill the vacuum. Cog-
hills and Silk Stockings are likely as ever.

Eortwo years past N.Z. has been worried
with a saurian, whose dimensions vary from a
post-office upwards, and which has horns and
spikes and red glaring eyes averaging from the
size of a shilling up to that of eighteen-pence or
more, and this animal has lately been the subject
of a lark, which for latent fiandisbness and aggre-
gate moral depravity has seldom been equalled.
About the middle of last month a small weak-
looking man with a shrill voice and a big head
and a pair of warped legs, stuck tbs town of
Hamilton, and plastered It all over with bills an-
nouncing that the saurian had been captured and
would ba exhibited that night—admission, six-
pence. Evening came, and the inhabitants rolled
up. Another puffy-headed little man took the
money at the door, and when the house was filled
the proprietor of the show delivered a lecture, in
the course of which the gaping clowns
of Hamilton learned more about saurians
in general than anybody ever knew before
or was likely to know again. Then the
audience yelled for the “rag” to go up, and
it rose slowly to reveal the fact that they had paid
an aggregate total of £8 3a. 6d, to see the man-
giest, meanest-lookicg, commonest specimen of
desolation on four legs that ever an audience had
witnessed. Right in front of them was the torn,
blown-up, mangled, dasbed-to-pieces carcase of
the most painfully ordinary cow that ever wore a
horn ; it was dead, and stuffed anyhow with straw
and chaff, and its hide, which looked as if it had
been wasted with fire and sword, was ornamented
with rude designs In red and blue paint. Ib was
shored up with curses and bits of old olothea-
prop, and its tail was starched and tied to the

down at the end of its broken neck, and trailed
wearily on the floor. Beside it stood the lecturer,
and in his sublime Infatuation he com-
menced to say, “ This remarkable animal,
gentlemen,” when a chair skimmed past
his head, and with a wild whoop the
audience rushed the platform ; and then he
bounded over the illustrated caw and made for
the window. He was caught before he got there
and thrown out on his head, and a hundred in-
furiated citizens fastened on the cow and whopped
the dead animal into shivers. The gas went out,
the furniture was smashed, and the puffy headed
i man who had taken the money at the door was
chased into the next county. Next morning
the inspector of nuisances, etcetera, removed
a cow’s head in an advanced stage of
decomposition, which was all that remained of
the show, and it is resolved that the next man
who exhibits a saurian at Hamilton shall be
lynched.

“ Harbour Lights,” with George Leitch as Tom

tralian M.L.A. :—“ He who takes my purse takes
rubbish, but he that takes from me my character
takes something that don’t do him no good and

The Canterbury (N.Z.) Times says that “ Charles
Warner, who is to take the place of Mr. Titheradge
with the great triumvirate, will, in some sort,
compensate for the loss of the beautiful Ameri-

a professional beauty of some kind or other,
Charles Warner, comedian, is coming to Mel-
bourne in February, under engagement to the
Triumvirate. Mary Anderson will also come if
her mother is well enough, but she won’t leave
the old lady behind. Fred. Loffie and Nellie
Farren are coming, quite irrespective of their
mothers. Alfred Cellier is also coming. Sara
Bernhardt isn’t. She says fhe can make £lOOO a
night in South America, and she isn’t going to
throw herself away for a miserable £250 a n'ght
in Australia. Nellie Stewart is coming, however,
which makes up—in fact, pretty nearly everybody
is coming, except Bismarck, the Pope, and Smith-
son, Duke of Northumberland.
London Graphic considers that it wou’d
be wiser for the English Government, instead of

fact that all available sleeping accommodation on

MEM OF MARK.
Clergymen of whatever denomination are un-
doubtedly men of mark. Perhaps ad do not
make their mark as preachers, yet at best preach-
ing is but one of the many attributes which go to
make up a successful minister. But we use the
expression “Men of Mark ” in its broadest sense.
Clergymen are examplers ; are virtually “ men of
mark ” in the community in which they minister.
The r acts are carefully noted, and their words
pondered on and believed. And it is right and
proper that this should be so. A man who un-
selfishly devotes his life to doing good, and to the
dissemination of that wisdom which is first pure,
then peac sable, should have the confidence and
respect of his fellow men. The Rev. H. Pattin-
son, of Roches'er, Vic oria, a gentleman well and
favourably known, was recently very near to
death His remarkable escape, and the rreans
emplojed, Is best told in his own words: “I
have suffered greatly at intervals during the las a
three years from kidney disease and stone in the
bladder. I tried various remedies, and got advice
from two or three doctors, but nothing I tried
gave me more than temporary relief. Frequently
when away from home attending to my pastoral
duties, have I suddenly been seized with a violent
pain in my b ck and right side, extending through
the groin and hip joints, which would almost
bring me double, and cruse the cold perspiraiion
to pour from my body These attacks were be-
coming more frequent and more severe each time.
I would have to pass through from 21 to 36 hours
of the most excruciating pain before I could get
any relief from the uss of bran poultices, hot
flannels, & and I would be left in such a weak
state, that before I gained a little strength I would
be seized with another attack. A day or two be-
fore these attacks the urine voided would be as
pale as clear water, but suddenly it would change
to a high colour, and after standing a little while
would be about one-third brickdust. At these
times it was generally scanty, and was voided with
pain. My life was becoming one of misery, and I
thought serioudy of giving up the work of the
ministry. I became wretcnedly thin, and to my
friends as well as myself It became evident that I
was not long for this world. I had heard a good
deal about Warner's safe care, but never made up
my mind to try it until advised by our chairman,
Rev. S. P. Webber, who wrote mo a letter seating
what benefit he had received. I bought three
bottles and some pills and commenced taking
them according to direction*. The first bottle
made me very ill ; I was not in much pain, but
passed a large quantity of blood. This continued
at intervals for about a fortnight, when I passed
away a small and was greatly relie red.
From that time I recovered rapidly, and after
taking about li bottles of Warner's safe cure, and
six vials of Warner’s safe pills, I feel quite well
again ; work has become a pleasure, and I have
been able to conduct nine weeks of special ser-
vices, apart from my ordinary work. I used to
suffer from indigestion, and had a poor appetite,
I can now sit up at table and enjoy a meal
thoroughly, and I feel none of the bad effects
afterwards as I used to do. All this has baen
wrought since last Easter, and I trust it will be
permanent, as I have every reason to believe It
will. I feel it my bounden duty to recommend
Warner’s sate cure and Warner's safe pills to all
who may be suffering from the same complaint as
I have been.”
The following named colonial clergymen have
also endorsed Warner's safe cure over their signa-
ture Rev. Father Kiley, C. 6., Yass, N.S.W.;
Rev. Henry Plume, M.A , Townsville, Q. ; Rev.
Thomas Brassington, Clermont, Q. ; Rev. Richard
Brown, Seymour, Yict. ; Rev. J. Wheatley,
Ipswich, Q.; Rev. Wm. Powell, Rockhampton’
Q. ; Rev. W. Poole, South Brisbane, Q. ; while
scores of clergymen in England, Canada, and ihs
United States have borne testimony to the un-
rivalled virtues of the preparation under notice.


Pepper
And
Salt
As an example of inane and pompous
weakness, New South Wales, just now, stands
pre-eminent. The mother-colony of Australia
has, at the present moment, a debt of £15,000,000,
an army and navy, a naval defence scheme, apian for
keeping out the Chinese, a revenue of millions
per annum, and a great array of fortifications with
a strong and warlike population behind them,
and, with all this outward show, such is her totter-
ing feebleness that she is trodden underfoot by one
cow. Down at Manly, there lives an international
outrage with a crumpled horn, which persistently
enters the garden of a local sheik and dines upon
the choicest blossoms, and the insulted citizen
last week laid the matter before the Council and
asked if he might get up early in the morning,
before the break of day as it were, and assault
this animated enormity with a two-pronged fork.
And the Council, in the depths of its aggregate im-
becility, didn’t know. Some of the members thought
he might rush the aggravating beast under the
S uperannuation Act of 1801, but they presently found
that measure had been repealed, and next they sug-
gested that he should read the Riot Act, and then
charge at his own risk and the cow’s, and when
the animal got outside he m’ght proceed against
it as a public enemy. But the Council would
take no responsibility, and the cow is still there.
There is no Act of Parliament large enough to
hold it, and it remains in defiance of international
obligations, the teachings of the moral law, and
the old-established customs of civilised races.
New South Wales, even while claiming to be in
itself the whole continent of Australia, is trodden
underfoot by one lachrymose cow, and held up to
public derision on the point of its crumpled horn ;
the country which professed to fight the battles
of Britain in the Soudan is laughed to scorn by a
lank old heifer with a threadbare tail, and the
shadow of that ill-omened brute is cast across the
coming Centenary. Could human degradation go
further ? „

It was a summer morning in a pleasant
up-country township in N.S.W. The sun shone
brightly from a cloudless sky ; the dew sparkled
on the grass, the air was loaded with daisy-scents
and the sweet odour of the violet, and the glad-
some cornstalks swore in the gutter. A dead cat
lay in the middle of the roadway. It was a small
tortoiseshell animal, and when people looked at it
they felt sorry for its untimely fate. All that day
it remained there, and towards evening a cart
went over its head and squashed it flat. Then
somebody kicked it, and a horse stepped on its
tail. Next*morning a little girl found it, and
played with it for a while till her mother slapped
her little ear and threw the cat into the gutter.
A boy wrapped it up in paper, and left it at the
house of a policeman, who, when he found out
what was In the package, swore and threw it
back into the street where it lay till nightfall.
Then somebody shied it in at an open bedroom-
window, and, a little later on, a sweet grey-eyed
girl in a night-dress took it up by the tail and
cast it forth with curses. It rose again on the
third day, when an omnibus stove it in,
and, as the sultry afternoon wore on, a lar-
rikin discharged a flattened, mutilated, evil-
smelling object into the local bank and hit the
accountant on the back of the head. The bill-
clerk chased him for half a mile, and the messen-
ger put the mouldy relic of the cat out in the
kennel by the aid of a pair of tongs. A drunken
man gat on it shortly afterwards, and had to be
disinfected before he could re-enter society.
There was a political meeting that night, and just
as an eloquent speaker demanded to know what
could be more corrupt than the policy of Protec-
tion, the cat landed on the desk in front of him,
a miserable wreck, with two legs, no head, and a
vanished tail. Then the Mayor, who was in the
chair, audibly ordered Policeman O’Rafferty to
take the beastly thing out and bury it, and his
order was attended to by the shuddering con-
stable. Or, at least, he said it was, and Police-
man O Doolan backed him up, but next night the
Mayor had a party, and a hideous object, all claws
and decay, came down the chimney, and scattered
the fire in all directions. It was the cat. It was
thrown out for the twentieth time, and nothing
more was heard of it till one ear turned up in the
parson’s water-supply. And yet they gay that
sanitary laws are carefully attended to in N.S.W.
The late floods at Goal burn (Vie.) washed
out quite a number of Mongolian settlements and
cam d them down to the briny deep. Patriarchal
attaches of great strength and low standing ware
tom out by the roots ; crazy furniture, slop-built
hovels, and the accumulated rottenness of years
were all borne away to the gladsome ocean, and
nothing but a few gaunt old cabbages, and the
corp-e of an ancient dog tethered to a stump,
were left to mark the spot where the heathen had
encouraged the growth of the caliot, the spling-
onion, and the lettucee. The stub nosed Pagans
wore washed out of their downy bunks during the
silent watches of the night, and climbing on their
roofs, looked out on a heaving waste of waters,
from the midst of which came the occasional wail
of a leper swept down upon the tide. Ore
monkeyish old heathen, who straddled the Gothic
root of a tottering ruin, refused to be taken off
unless his pig, which was deftly poised on an
adjacent chimney, was also saved, and the rescue
party told him they would see him condemned
first, and left. Then the pig elevated his curly
till to the blast and struck out for the shore, and
Ms owner breathed forth a curse and started
ia pursuit in a wash-tub. The race was
an exciting one. but the porker kept ahead,
and the Chow, being spilt out, was finally saved
by a party on a raft, who stuck a boat-hook in his
ear, and, lifting him out of the wet, stood him on
his head to leak When he recovered he lifted up
his voice and wept, and swore he would prosecute
everybody within ten miles if they did not save
his skedaddling pork, and then the rescue-party
swore at him and kicked him. At last, however,
all the Chlnkies were saved and landed safely
above high-water mark, but their beloved asso-
ciations, their pigs, their shanties, and their
I treasured and well-defined stinks —alas! Where

In this uncertain and treacherous worlali,
when the thing which man contemplates has bust
like the worm of the earth which is here
to-day and to-morrow is oast into the oven —when
his tenderesb feelings have gone up the spout, and
the fondest desire of his heart has been rolled in
the dust, and all terrestrial joys have sloped, it is
customary to assert that a woman had something
to do with it.] The idyls of the dusty back-blocks
bear undying witness to the unreliability of the
female of our species, and the songs of the up-
oountry poet, whan he isn’t singing about the
I wattle, tell in mournful strain of how woman's
love salts the human claim- Only a few days ago,
in a lonely township on the Darling, a man was
sitting on a doorstep and thinking sadly of these
things. He was one of three who had spent the
treasure of the'r affections on the same lovely
maiden, and two of them had been left. The first
had been hanging around for a year and a half,
and at the end of that time tho girl voted him a
dreary bo-e and gave him the sack, The
second had spent all his cash in rings,
brooches, bracelet?, and finery, and when
he was dead-broke the lady had gone back on
him just 48 hours before the wedding day,
and had married another. The third was the
happy husband, a wily party with a red goatee,
and ho had not only collared the girl, but all the
! presents besides. As we already mentioned, a man
was sitting on a doorstep. He was the second of
the three lovers, the one who had fooled away all
his assets in jewellery, and it was the girl’s door-
step he was sitting on. He had kicked 16 times
at the portal of her marble halls, and then he sat
down to wait with a look of desperate resolve in
his eyes and a pair of large boots on his feet. He
asked through the keyhole if tho old cat was at
home, but there was no response, and then he
called out that her hair wasn’t her own, and
where did she buy her teeth? That fetched her.
She opened the door, and, looking ather discarded
lover with an expression of tender reproach in
her eyes, sa'.d she would sool the log on to him
and he laughed and called her husband ‘ ‘ Carrots. I
Then he explained in a cold and arrogant tone I
that he would sit there all day and make re-
marks about her hair and teeth loud enough for j
all the world to hear, unless she gave him back
his presents, and she retired, bathed in grief, and
threw all the expensive bric-a-brac out on the
pavement. He carefully piled them up in a heap
in front of the house and jumped on them, and
having thus given expression to his feelings, he
set the pile on fire and sang comic songs while it
slowly resolved itself into ashes. When her hus-
band cane round the corner with an axe-handle
halt-an-hour later, all that remained of the sacri-
fice was a heap of ashes on the footpath, two
dirty boot-marks on the steps, a girl in hysterics
in the parlour, and no dinner ready, and when he
asked her what she was boo-hooing about she
went off again and said he was a brnte.

The N.S.W. Minister for Justice is re-
quested to note the fact that the District Court
presided over by a certain judge, is, if the

of Punch being enacted by his Honor. The public
don’t think much of the brand of law which is
ladled out by au official who is eternally straining
for washy jokes and talking at the reporters, and
who, during the progress of a case, stands up a
few dozen times, and petulantly yelps: “ Oh,
dear, dear, you will kill me yet; you will worry
me to death. Dear, dear, I don’t think I can go
on with this case—l feel very bad this morning.
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear 1" There are plenty of

A PLAY UPON WORDS.
(FOR MEN ONLY.)
Mary Jones, she was a “ tart" —
The nicest bit of “jam”;
She nestled to my loving heart
As gentle as a lamb.
No fellow ever was more struck •
She seemed a little “treat,”
A “ daisy” girl, a perfect “ duck
Quite nice enough to eat.
But Mary’s tongue is awful tart
Since she was Mrs. Brown.
She “ puts on jam,” and, bless my heart I
Delights to “lamb” me down.
No husband is more often struck;
Unless I stand her “ treat,”
My dazy head I have to duck—
She’s nice enough to heat.
Yes, though Love’s fire brightly burned,
And warm was my desire,
To-day, as far as I’m concerned,
She might be on the fire.
The mere effect of changing names.
By Benedict! was such
That if I saw my “ flame ” in flames,
I shouldn't worry much.
The girls are well enough to kiss,
Or write about in rhyme—
But ne'er disturb their single bliss,
And spoil your wild time.
Still let each darling do the Block
With wedlock in her head,
And, though you steal therefrom a look,
Don’t also try the “ wed.”

above the collar a, thin red line. The striking
costume was based on tan leather shoes and
crowned by a light Tyrolean bat. A white Pomer-
anian dog followed at his htels. His invariable
salutation to his feminine acquaintances was, ‘Are
you drinkiug the watahs this morning V ”
Marcus Clarke used to say that every
Dublin man he met was a Trinity College man.
Nearly every Dublin man you meet in Australia
comes from an aristocratic portion of the city—in
fact no man ever saw a plebeian from the Liffey.
At a large hotel in the N. S W, back-blocks last
Easter six or seven of the guests were from the
Iri«h capital and most of them had a “ town
house” to boast of One silent individual, on
being asked what part he came from, made the
rest of the company somewhat uncomfortable by
declaring that he was born in Phllane, as all
Dublin men could not be aristocrats.
It is not generally known that his Honor
Sir George Innes, of the N.S.W. Supreme Court
bench, was (during the time of hia C.P.S.-ship at
Sofala) a very capable amateur jockey. There
were races at the rich goldfield at Tambaroora,
and the C P.S. was to astonish the red-shirted
diggers with his feats in the pigskin. When
scaling before the race “ Sir Joe ” was found to be
* too light for his mount, and, as the loch racing
arrangements were of a very primitive order some
difficulty was experienced in finding material to
make weight. Happy thought! Any amount of
gold was in the'eamp, and “ Sir Joe ” rode h’is race,
and won it too, encircled with a belt containing
several pounds of gold-dust!
The cabled announcement that the “ Pic-
turesque Atlas of Australasia” has obtained en-
thusiastic commendation from the London Times
is not surprising. Apart altogether from the un-
doubted excellence of this ambitious and compre-
hensive work, there is the fact that Dr. Garran,
who edits the “ Atlas,” was for many years Aus-
tralian correspondent of the Times. Tne veteran
Doctor's name, by the way, carries weight in
London, not only by reason of his having been for
many years editor of the Sydney Mornivg
Herald, but also on account of the fact that the
artie'e on Australia in the “ Encyclopedia Brit-
tanica” came from his pen, and bears his signa-
ture.
Yon Moltke has just celebrated his 87th
birthday. He married an English wife, who is
now dead, but with pathetic intensity of devotion
he has kept her memory green. On his birthday
he went, as usual, to his quiet country home, and
from morn fill night never moved out of one room
—his wife's. This is a charming apartment
lighted by three lofty windows, and commands a
view of the spot where she lies at rest. Since her
death nothing has been moved in the room, and
here, in communion with the past, and in thought
about the future, Germany's cap.ain o’ war keeps
his birthday. What a lot of poetry a butcher can
hold, to be sure ! This sublime reflection has
often occurred to us as we listene i to an oration
by Dan. O’Connor, M.P. '
Anecdotes of a “great man’s” infancy
are always interesting. Here is one which the
widow of a Queensland litterateur- is wont to tell
of the days when the infant was a
gawky youth of 16. From the first, the household,
beginning from the Reverend Papa, and passing
down through the Irish cook to the cow and the
pig, were trained to look upon the infant Psalmyell
as the hope and idol of the great name of Ap
Gryphitthe. On a certain occasion an evening
party was given, and this lady, then a sprightly
damsel, well aware of such sublunary actualities
as a healthy hunger and digestive apparatus, was
present. At about 9 o’clock there was an adjourn-
ment to an inner room for light refreshments, and
there the damsel happened to cast her eyes on a
plate of pleasant and dainty sugary cakes. It
occurred to her to wish for some. But what were
the decrees of an all-wise Providence in this
matter ? The infant Psalmy ell was presently per-
ceived, seated in a corner, solemnly and 'deliber-
ately consuming the whole plateful I And the
Reverend Papa, beaming with pride and pleasure,
watched thewhole process out, and thanked Heaven
he had a son and heir like that! And ever since
then, in whatever he has done, Psalmyell has ful-
filled his youthful role and eaten up all the cakes.
But it is not given to all men ts rejo'ce at it, and
hence . . . Well, hence hce la'-rimce I
POLITICAL
POINTS
The Governor of Australia —the Admiral
of the Fleet.
The Tories are going to deprive Irish poli-
tical offenders of the right of appeal against the
decisions of magistrates!
“ A Country Gaoler ” suggests that the
name of N.S.W. shall be altered to “Australia,
alias New South Wales.”
In six years, while the population of
N.S.W. has increased 36 per cent, that of Sydney
has advanced 57 per cent,!
The realisation of Responsible Govern-
ment in Western Australia kills the last Crown
colony in Australasia. We are seven.

SINGULAR AND PLURAL
“THANK GOD, AUSTRALIA CAN STAND ALONE! ’-PARKES.
“THANK HEAVEN, AUSTRALIA CAN STAND SEVERAL LOANS.”— BULLETIN.
Germany has lent China 100 officers to
re-organise her army. Thus do the “ Chinese of
Europe ” coalesce with the Chinese of Asia.
Unprejudiced persons, who have of late
travelled the N.S.W. country districts, say that
the Calico cruse has completely gone bung.
Dr. Cords will, at next election, be de-
feated for Bathurst, should he stand. Politically,
Dr. Cortis is stupid enough to make the attempt.
In answer to a question at St. Leonards
hustings on 2nd February last Parkes said: “I
will be no party to an all-round reduction of Civil
service salaries.”
In the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly on
the night of Friday week there were five members
“close-up” dead-drunk. A large number of
others were partially sober.
The designs for the N.S.W, State House
place the cost at £500,000. Parkes says he can
get it done for less than half that. He probably
means to build it on I O. U’s.
Joe Abbott hopes that if he remains in
public life for thirty years his record will be
cleaner than that of Sir Henry Parkes. Some
men have mighty poor aspirations.
Mr. John See, M.P., says that much of
the strong drink now sold in N.S.W, is worse
than “ Rough on Rats.” If this is true some hon.
members must be made of sterner stuff than rats
are.
Griffith, who was lifted into power and
remains in office solely because of his opposition
to cheap labour, bases his approval of the Naval
Defence Scheme on the employment of under-paid
seamen.
Thescheme to re-name N.S.W. “Australia”
is not more original than Parkes' borrowed Public
Schools Act. Years ago, when Victoria separated,
a party, headed by Dr. Lang, mooted the same
proposal.
Some N.S.W. groveller writes to the
S.M. Herald to suggest that the name of the
colony be changed to “ Alberta, Alfreda, Leo-
poloia, or Caringtonia.” Why not add Batten-
bergia and Johnbrovmia to the list ?
Premier Playford, of S.A., expects that
eight appointments to Legislative Council va-
cancies, which occur next March, wifi result in
the adoption ol the Chinese poll-tax in the
Northern Mongol-plagued portion of the colony.
Lord Rosebery hopes that when James
Service returns to Victoria he will continue to
occupy (wrong expression) the prominent and
powerful position in the colony which he pre-
viously held. That’s up against Duncan Gillies,
Premier.
The 63 N.S.W. Government supporters
have managed to secure £11,124 for their parks ;
the 43 Opposition members could only scoop a
paltry £l5BB, “To the'victors belong the spoils.”
By this time the country should be full of
Park(e)s.
Queensland pays £7610 annually for its
Vice-regal ornament. The first Governor received
£2500, and was probably the ablest. Consequently,
the next old pensioner sent to Brisbane Govern-
ment House from England will have to accept a
reduced screw.
Mr. Minister Clarke gave himself away
rather cheaply at the N.S.W. Art Society banquet,
when he said. “ I always avoid making a speech,
either in Parliament or out of it,” Well, no one
ever expected him to make one. Men do not look
for figs on thistles, or ostrich-plumes on a razor-
back pig.
At the Chaffeys’ irrigation colony of Mil
dura, Victoria, 80,000 acres of land are ready for
immediate settlement. They expect before the
irrigation works are completed to have 5000
people sett’ed in the place, to swell to 20,000 be-
fore the colony finally passes from the hands of its
promoters.
A yonng man has just been devoured by a
water-shark, and all the papers are full of the
“ horrible occurrence.” Whole families are eaten
up every day by the land-sharks, and no notice
whatever is taken except to run the sharks into
position and power, and observe that “ the bless-
ing of Heaven maketh rich.”
Vogel “ has evolved a scheme for reliev-
ing N.Z. from its difficulties, and ensuring the
immediate return of prosperity,” M'Gregor,
M.P., intends to ask the Government if they will
purchase the proprietary rights in said scheme for
the sum of £lO,OOO. Is there so much money left
in the land of the unredeemed ?
Parkes “ insists that the change of the
name of N.S.W. to ‘ Australia ’ meets with the
approval of the vast majority of the settled in-
habitants of the territory.” By settled Inhabi-
tants he probably means the old hands. There is
nothing very improbable in the notion that they
approve of the proposed burglary.
A stranger to Sydney, who visited the
N.S.W. Assembly durirg the naval defences dis-
cussion, noticed one of the members for Northum-
berland (Mr. Walker) rise some ten times to
“ catch the Speaker s eje,” but, strange to say.
Walker missed each time. It looked curious to
tne visitor, but no doubt the Speaker is impartial.
Last year the English missions in Persia,
Palestine, Egypt, and Arabia, cost £ll,BOl 9s. 6d ,
and the result was one convert. He was an aw -
fully expensive convert, and, on a rough estimate,
172 of the London poor could have been saved
from the horrors of 12 months of slow starvation
with the money that was frittered away in teach-
ing this one little nigger the beautiful s'ory of
how Jonah swallowed the whale.
Says the S.M. Herald :—“ It is a matter
for congratulation that at a time when many per-
sons are unemployed, and when the profits of
trade and industry are small, the prices of the
leading articles of consumption are unusually
low.” Why, cert’n’ly. It Is a matter for congraj
tulation that, while Freetrade makes one or tvs o
articles of food cheaper, it should, by leaving the
workman unemployed, prevent him from obtain-
ing any of them.
We rise to inquire ! Sydney D.T. ascribes
the Imperialism of Parkes (who is also called
Sharkes) to the poetical fibre in him. Shake-
speare, however (acoordirg to the D.T.) was a
poet, and yet he was ‘‘ mildly and sweetly
reasonable.” We are yearning for the connecting-
link here Now, one of the few authentic relics
of Shakespeare is a writ which he served in his
later years on a man who owed him £2 for wool.
Can it be that Parkes , . , that Shakespeare
. . . that . . , No; we give it up
Sir Alfred Stephen, G.C.M.G,, Lieuten-
ant-Governor of N.S.W., &c., &0., is reported to
have said that Queen Victoria is “the most bene-
ficent and gracious woman and the greatest
sovereign who has filled the English throne,” To
what a Grand Cross ship and a pension will reduce
a man in his extreme old age! A Y/ctorian
journal suggests that the reporter didn’t catch
correctly what the old gentleman said, and that,
possibly, what he really stated was that Vic, was
“a most indifferent and rapacious woman, and
had the greatest number of sovereigns of anyone
that had filled the English throne.”
That eminent British peer, the Duke of
Richmond, has just so'd his Government pension
of £19,000 a year for a few hundreds of thousands
in hard cash. His ancestress was a French “ un-
married mother," and his ancestor was Charles
11., who promised, at his coronation, to be a
father to his people, and did his best to keep his
word. The original Duke of Richmond got a pen-
sion of £19,000 in recognition of his distinguished
services, rendered by being the son of his mother
when his father wasn’t married to her, and, in
the course of the last 200 years, Britain has paid
some £3,800,000 to his family in its efforts to wipe
off this eld score. Who says the mother country
is ungrateful ?
“ The Butter Trade, a Big Business with-
out Protection,” is the imposing heading of an
article in a recent issue of the Sydney News. On
reading it through, we learn that last summer 300
tons of butter were bought in Sydney for if 1. per
lb., and sold in London as oil. This is, no doubt,
a big business, but we fail to reconcile it with the
recent establishment in Sydney of an oleomar-
gariae factory, or to see where the eathuslasm
comas in. Icis also the sorb of business that
grows up without Protection, but again we fail to
see what the row is all about. The Freetrader
who can get up an excitement over selling N.S. W.
butter at jpi. per lb. in London as oil must be an
aas of no mean order.
As Premier, it would seem, from what we
read and hear, that Parkes has utterly lost
his grip. Politicians and pressmen have now
begun to quietly discuss the allotment of the
next batch of New South Wa’es Minis-
terial portfolios. There is a very strong proba-
bility that the coming administration (when it
doss come) will be, flfrally, a Ministry of com-
promise ; it may be bee ded y Mr. Barton, or Mr.
G. II Reid, and contain Me m-s. Abbott, Dibbs, and
Copeland. It is not probable that when a general
election eventuates either freetraders or protec-
tionists will secure a sweeping majority ; but it is
now pretty certain that Parkes will be wiped out
—this time, probably, never again to return to
office.
A nephew of the late Sir Alexander
Stuart’s, of N.S.W., Professor Stuart, M.P., has
been visiting Ireland. On his return he lectured in
the Shoreditch (London) Town Hall, and gavealong
and minute description of his experiences. This
is his opinion of the Irish political situation
They saw, as he had seen with his own eyes, on the one
hand, the Government of the country provoking the people
to violence and outrage—(shame)—and, on the other hand
the chosen leaders of the people restraining those people
within the limits of Constitutional agitation. (Hear, hear )
1 hey saw, in fact, a picture absolutely the reverse of that which
their opponents endeavoured to paint. But there was one
safeguard in Ireland just now. The Government knew full
well that if they succeeded in driving the people to crime and
outrage the deck of Ireland’s progress would be stopped,
and the game of the Government would be played The
Irish people knew that they had at their back what they had
never had before—a great multitude of the people of England
Premier Sharkes “ expects that there will
yet be a noble federation of all the English-speak-
ing races of the world.” This is a large-sized
f.entinient, but where do the people who try to
speak Hinglish, and can't manage P, come in ?
What about the men who drop their haitches all
hover the floor of the ’Ouse, for hinstance*
Premier Sharkes himself doesn’t belong to an
English-speaking race, or, if he does, he is a dis-
grace to it. If war ever should break out in Aus-
tralia he is the sort of man who would get up in a
piratical uniform and issue orders to slay hall the
hinsurgents, but to spare the haged and hicno-
cent, and he can tha left alone in the same room
with an h” unless the man who leaves him
there wants to find the poor, unoffending letter
weltering in its gore. And this is the sort of in-
dividual who talks of the federation of the Eng-
lish-speaking races!
Last week, the cableman wired that Mr.
F. H. O’Donnell, M.P., had been entreated by the
Irish Nationalists to stay his libel-action against
the Times, the League being afraid of disclosures
should the ac ion he taken into court. It is
further alleged that Mr. O’Donnell has been
threatened with assassination in the event of pro-
ceeding further in the ma ter. Our opinion is
that this action of the much eye-glassed O'Don-
nell Is a bogus one, got up in the interests of the
Times and Tories, with the view to discredit the
Irish National cause. Mr. O'Donnell, we remem-
ber, never worked cordially with the Parnellite
party, who, at last, had to deprive him of his seat
for Dungarvan. As he gets his living in the
capacity of foreign editor of the high Tory Morn-
ing Post, It is difficult to see how he can simul-
taneously serve Mickey O'Hoo’ivan and John Bull
as represented by Sir Algernon Borthwick.

Society
Miss Clarke, eldest daughter of the only Aus-
tralian-made baronet, committed matrimony with
Mr. C. F. M'Donald, of N.S.W., on Thursday las’ 1 .
A special train-load of Victoria’s old nobility was
rattled down to Sunbury, to assist at this Interest-
ing festival, and the township broke out in bunt-
ing very considerably. There were eight brides-
maids (each of whom received a diamond brooch
from the happy man, in return for her kindness in
seeing the bride put through), and what with
them, and their dresses, and the bride’s train, and
Lady Loch, Lady Clarke, immediate relatives, ard
the Governor, and the parson, the little church
was so chock-full that a number of invited guests
had to stay at Sir William’s house and nibble re-
freshments until the bridal troupe returned. The
bridegroom didn’t take up much valuable space
in church, but, anyway, he had to be there. But
why bridegrooms can’t be left outside in the
carriage, and fixed up on their affidavit, goodness
only knows. Stuck in front of the altar, with a
background of fashionable millinery, a bridegroom
looks like a nasty weed in a beautiful bed of
blossoms. But this is outside of sassiety report-
ing. To resume. After the distinguished com-
pany had severely punished a wedding-breakfast,
Mrs. M'Donald and her husband departed to enioy
la lune de miel (which is French) amid a shower
of rice, grains of which were subsequently dis-
covered by the happy pair in such strange places
you would scarcely imagine. Yes, and among
the presents was a silver salver from “ Ivo Bligh’s
team of cricketers,” which was bought, presum-
ably, when one of that said team was reported to
be . But, no matter, it’s no use wasting a
silver salver.
* * *
The Melbourne Herald sent a spe-
cial reporter to Sunbury last week with
instructions to telegraph treacle about the
wedding of Miss Clarke. But somehow the
“special" didn’t rise to the subject as
might have been expected, and the principal
performers got shockingly bad notices, considering
their rank and station. The bride-a baronet's
daughter—was “ a young lady of pleasing counte-
nance,” while the bridegroom was “ 28 years of
age, medium height, and with a Scotch cast of
countenance.” The cloven-hoof of the police-court
reporter has left its indelible imprint upon those
two descriptions. They would do very well for
prosecutrix and prisoner in an “ attempted
murder ’ case, but sassiety demands that a well-
dowered maiden in a bridal-wreath shall look
“exceedingly pretty,’’[doncherknow. And then,
to hitch her to a gentleman with a Scotch cast
of countenance, sandy eyelashes, and three coats
of freckles! It s just plain, hard, literary dough,
with no treacle on it at all.
* * *
The braw Soots of Melbourne put them-
selves outside a Caledonian Society dinner last
week, and wound up proceedings by blowing their
own little bagpipes, as Scotchmen love to blow.
Sir Henry Loch—carried away by the prospect of
his £6OOO grant from Government—mentioned a
few of the qualities which “made them (the
Macs) the greatest people in the world.” He
didn’t say what a roaring, lively world it would
be without Scotchmen —bub, no matter. Then
Jimmy Munro spoke a few words about Edin-
burgh and “Empire Scotsmen ’ (whatever those
things are !), and Simon Fraser, immortalised by
Millais’ brush, said, “ They must fervently hope
that they would be enabled to do still more for
this part of the Empire.” Great Scott! this is too
much. Do these clannish, close-fisted, old fossils
want this part of the Empire to do more for them ?
It’s impossible. They have prayed together, saved
together, stuck together, and schemed together
until tbe whole country is groaning beneath the
dreary, Oalvinistio yoke, and its motto ought to
be, “ Save your soul and your saxpences.”

Jacob Garrard, M.P., like Mayor Riley,
never misses a meeting of the (Sydney) Queen’s
Fund Committee, whereof Lady Carington is
president. The Bulletin used rather to admire
Jacob Garrard when, while a member of Parlia-
ment, he attended one of the Government offices,
with his bag of tools slung over his back, for the
purpose of mending a lift. That looked like true
Democracy, and suggested the coming time when
men elected to serve the labour interest in Parlia-
ment will not deem it necessary to doff the garb of
labour, and attire themselves in parson’s black and
belltoppers before going to the House. Bat now
Jacob is becoming “beastly respectable”—nob to
say aristocratic —like all the other so-called labour
members, Jpropos, tte stalwart Mr. Hassall.
M.L.A , of N.S.W., promises to bead a revolt
against' the English black coat End Pbilistinish
tile. At a recent swell race-meeting be appeared
dressed like a real Australian—in Queensland
busbman’s rig. We hope to see him turn out on
future occasions with a contingent of strapping
natives who will, by their good example, show
Australians hnw to accommodate themselves to
their climate instead of slavishly following in the
wake of the London stockbroker.

Another relative of Queen Victoria has
turned up, a New York lady, who says she is the
eldest daughter of Her Gracious. According to
her story Albert the Good was encumbered with a
baby daughter when Victoria proposed to him,
and one day, when he was out wheel-
ing the perambulator in Windsor Park, and
thinking of nothing at all, the mother of the in-
fant came down on him with a screech, and told
him he must either consent to an exchange or she
would go to the palace and tell all. The unpro-
tected male collapsed beneath the shock, and
brought back the wrong baby in the perambula-
tor ; while the royal princess went to be brought
up in a back street in New York. This looks a
very probable yarn.

“ But wouldn’t he leave his name?” de-
manded Miss Nellie of the new housemaid.
“ Always ask a gentleman to leave his name.”

An English sporting lady made a slight
sensation lately on a French racecourse. She
appeared in evening dress for one thing, and, for
another, she bet £2 on the favourite, and when he
lost, she kicked the jockey’s teeth in, and burst
herself all out of her clothes in the process. By
the time the police got her down and hustled her
into a cab, she had been in about six fights, and
had very little on except a rag or two and her
boots.

A very swell new-chum, who wears checks
as big as 640-acre paddocks, and who is staying
at the Union Club, Sydney, says: “I must con-
fess I am rather afraid to walk abaut the Blue
Mountains, dontcherknow; I have read in the
papers that the locality is infested by very deadly
serpents.” “ Serpents” is good. So English, yer
know.

“A Nervous Patient” writes to The
Bulletin from Sydney Infirmary, inquiring
“why a big cockatoo, apparently belonging to

rockets, and other fireworks are allowed to be
exploded n’ghtly in the Park just behind the

At the first annual conference of the
Women’s Christian Temperance Union of Vic-
toria, held a few days ago, an essay was read on
“How best to Rouse the Women of Australia.”
A first-rate plan would be to drop a lively frog
down each lady’s back and let loose some mice,
but, in the case of married ladies, a golden hair
on their husband’s coat-collar, or a ballet girl’s
photo, in his pocket, will rouse them more effec-
tually than a kick from a N.Z, earthquake.

What is to become of the “ ancient aris-
tocratic race ? ” More than half of the wives of
the “ landed gentry of England ” arer going into
trade to retrieve the fortunes lost to them by the
fall in rents. One of the fashionable beauties has
opened a shop In Berkeley-square for the sale of
decorative housework ; another equally attractive
has opened a dressmaking establishment; one of

Dear Bulletin. —Shiels, of the Victorian
Assembly, though in favour of domestic option in
the matter of marriage and divorce, is dead
against local option in the grog-traffic He says,
“ If the licensed victuallers were attacked one
year, where was the security that the butchers
and the grocers would not be attacked next?”
Just so. If, as Primate Barry says, the immor-
ality of N.S.W. is “ all on account of the meat,”
why not make a raid on the butchers and license
them and subject them to local option 1 There is
also a class of people in England—and Australia,
top—known as “ tea-drunkard i.” Why shouldn’t
they be saved from ruin and degradation ? Why
shouldn’t Smith, the grocer, he summoned for
selling more than one pound of tea a-month to
the same woman, just as Murphy, the publican,
is pulled for giving more than twenty long beers
at a sitting to one wharf-lumper ? If there is to
be local option let it be all round. In Melbourne,
local option is being carried very far. The other
day good old Dr. Singleton wanted to establish,
on Collingwocd Flat, a night refuge for homeless
women, but the Flatites in the neighborhood of
the proposed Refuge rose en masse in their might I
and petitioned the Municipal Council against the I
“nuisance.” There’s local option for you I—l

“ The Queen was quite intoxicated one
day last week.” We got as far as that in an
opening paragraph of Modern Society, and then
stopped awhile to wipe away the welling tear.
Old memories of wicked tales we had heard, any
time these last 20 years, flitted across our fevered
brain. Our sublime faith—first planted in us by
the Church of England Litany, and developed to
sturdy strength at complimen f ary banquets to
C.M.G.’s—in the monarchical institution was
shaken, like leaflets by the whirlwind. An itiner-
ant musician was playing the National Anthem
outside our cottage door ; we gave him twopence
to strike up the “ Marseillaise .” If a Nihilist
had dropped in at that awful time, we might have
banded him a trifle to be expended In the pur-
chase of nitro glycerine for European potentates.
Then we read on—“ with grief, when her
favourite dog Noble died at Balmoral Castle.”
Fheugh! the frenzy passed away, and we blushed
for our Republican sentiments. Her Gracious
was intoxicated with grief over the loss of her
dawg. Only one more proof of her womanly
sympathy with all classes of her subjects. We
fetched forth the rum-bottle end drank her royal
health until intoxication was no name for it.

Alas ! poor “ Dr.” Thomas. Crushed
again! This time beneath the wheels of a Southern
express railway-engine, near Moss Vale, N.S.W.
He was deaf, and so heard not the roar of the ap-
proaching machinery which mangled all that was
left of a man who had for years travelled the
wilds of Australia with patent medicines and
queer lectures. Fate was always against him. It
deprived him of hearing ere he attained to man-
hood ; it made him a vendor of nostrums and a
retailer of strange discoursis to empty benches,
and, finally, it remorselessly crusl ed him to a grisly
mass of palpitating pulp. The “Doctor” was
once lecturing at a town in Western N.S.W,, and,
to give the show a tone, prevailed on a local
solicitor to preside. The performance had not
long commenced when laughter ran riot. The
lecturer had, however, by this time warmed
to his subject, and, being deaf, and tolerably Wind
also, was oblivious of the merriment below. The
president’s wife and heir were in the hall, and
no sooner did the youngster spot his dad upon the
platform than he cried to be with him. The
audience were soon heedless cf the Doctor, and
Intent upen the boy. But on went the Doctor at
a Walkerian rate, and up ran the boy to his
pa. The lecturer here realised the state of
affairs only to intensify them by dragging the
infant from the father and confining his Cicero-
nian gestures to one hand. The more the bay
squealed for the chairman, his father, the louder
and more impassioned waxed the eloquence of the
lecturer, and the wilder grew the applause and
laughter below. The scene was a novel one, and
within the four walls of the building there was
but one who did not appreciate the situation —
this was the mother of the boy and wife of the
chairman. She capped that evening's show by
reaching the platform in three bounds, arresting
her boy, emptying the water-bottle in the face of
the “Doctor,” and fleeing from the building by a
side-door.
Some years ago, a mild sensation was
caused in Melbourne by a marriage, the parties to
which were the middle-aged Mr. John White-
man. legislator, blacksmith, and poet, on the one
side, and, on the other, a young and handsome
blonde, Miss Alice Cornwell, who, being now
separated from her husband, again calls herself
Miss Alice Cornwell. She is the daughter of a
well-known Melbourne contractor, and is an ad-
mirable mixture of the romantic and the practical,
The lady is now in London, where she is known as
“ the Princess Midas" —this by reason of her con-
nection with the celebrated Midas goldmine, just
north of Ballarat. Some years ago Miss Cornwell
visited Europe; the studied mueio in Germany,
and published in London a somewhat curious
volume—“ The Australian Birthday Book,” by
Myra Marbron—containing extracts from various
alleged Australian poets, the works of Mr.
Patchett Martin not being overlooked. Then she
returned to Australia, and embarked in mining
speculation with wonderful success —
The lady was possessed of a small capital of her own, some
£2OOO, every shilling of which she invested in diamond bor-
ing over a tract of unprospected country near Ballarat. Her
money became exhausted just as the certainty of an El
Dorado beneath her feet was almost assured. It only
needed, as she believed, £5OO more to convert probability into
absolute proof. With much difficulty she succeeded in rais-
ing this sum. The tests applied showed that iOO feet below
the hard basalt to the north of Ballarat lay an alluvial water-
course, four feet in depth, which extended, as far as exa-
mined, for two miles. Commencing 78 feet from the sur-
face, with a width of 70 feet, it had a rapid fall to 114 feet at
300 feet, with a width of 200 feet, and at a mile and a-half the
width exceeded a thousand feet. Here alone was a rich
auriferous deposit which it would take 20 or 30 years to exhaust.
The diamond-drill cut in all directions through auriferous
reefs, and absolute proof was obtained that the new district
was not only equal to Ballarat, but probably extended many
miles in a northed* direction. Possibly this old alluvial
water-course may flow on gold-laden till, like that other
“ shining river,” it reaches the watershed at Clunes. Miss
Cornwell had little difficulty now in getting the small funds
necessary to start the Midas Gold-Mining Company, which
so far has provided all the costs of its workingand machinery
to the tune of about £35,000, and from itwas lately extracted
by a Chinaman the wonderful Lady Loch nugget of 6170 z.
This nugget Miss Cornwell has on view in London,
at her elegant offices In Queen Victoria-street.
She is now up to her pretty little neck in com-
pany-mongering, and smiles adroitly on the Press
with an eye to business. The Midas claim is being
floated for £lBO,OOO.

When a Queensland major speaks disre-
spectfully of his colonel they don’t hang, draw,
and quarter him, but they treat him almost as
badly by writing a reprimand, and inserting it in
the Government Gazette close to those im-
pounding notices which tell people all about red
heifers branded on the off but we suppose we
mustn’t. This is the way Major John Stevenson
has jnst teen treated, though he is a fully-
fledged M.L.A., and one of the hardest hitters in
the Assembly. When the Government, to which
John is strongly opposed, wanted to increase the
salary of the Auditor-General, it was argued that,
had the officer In question remained in a bank
with which he had been connected, he would
probably have been promoted to the managership,
with a bigger screw than that proposed to give
him, whereupon the Major immediately cried,
“ You might as well say that if your Attorney-
General (Rutledge) had stuck to the Church,
instead cf flinging it up because the law paid
better, he'd be a bishop by this time.” Rutledge
was present, and his face at once became as red
as that fire which he was wont to warn his con-
gregation against in the happy, though not pay-
able, past.
He (before the wedding): “You are sure
you won’t be nervous at the altar?” She (four
times a widow): “ I never have been yet.”
• • *
Which recalls a venerable chestnut. She
(a few days before the event): “Adolphus,
dearest, I do hope yon a*e net superstit’ous.”
“ And wherefore, my angel ?” And she clurg to
him, and murmured : “ Because, Adolphus, you
are the 13th I've been engaged to, and mamma is
so arxlous about it?”

We beg to call attention to the fact that
old man Quinn, aged 75, a free born citizen of
Hamilton (Yic ), has been ordered to cor tribute
to the clothing and victualling of his 35 year-old
wife, notwithstanding several effusions which she
penned to “ My dearest pet, Willie,” and another
male whom she declared to be nobody’s darling
but her own. We fail to see that lovely woman
could be more favourably legislated for than this.
She can have lots of “ ownest own ” darlings,
while the old man must bear his sorrow in silence
lest she pull him for maintenance, in which case
he loses a stray slice of love and £1 a week. On
the other hand, if his luvin’ wife catches him
toying with the ringlets of a private barmaid, or
interviewing the pretty white-capped housemaid
on the staircase-landing when the gas jjis out, she
flounces Into the Divorce Court, or sues him for
maintenance and leads him the life of a De Ben-
saude if she does neither. Marriage is a fearsome
responsibility.

The maintenance case, Mennell v.
Mennell, heard at an Echuca Police Court, a few

men who are struggling to keep out of matrimony
and other evil courses. Mr. Mennell is a growing
boy of eighteen, with a weak chest and sandy
blonde hair, and Mrs Mennell ii a lady bordering
on 30 She charged her hubby with desertion,
and being a bad boy generally, dirtying his pinny,
and such. She had been married before, and
knew how to manage children, having had a few
of her own, but than husband of hers was the per-
versest of boys. It transpired in evidence that
Mr. Mennell cried to be hushed off to sleep of
nights, and was wont to rush home to his ma
when he was vexed, although his fond wife tried
to reassure him by promising to tear out his liver
and other important sections of his works. Mrs,
Mennell did not know exactly what she wanted
done to her lord, but seemed to think five years
in a reformatory with regular doses of cat would
improve him considerably. Case postponed to
allow the husband time to grow.

Dear, gentle woman is of a double-distilled
angelic nature down about Hay, N.S.W. The
other day, a charming creature had her husband
up before the local J.sP., and this is how she
described, in her own sweet language, the winning
ways in which she sought to bring her wayward
partner back to love and duty
“I was lying down on nay sister’s ted," said she, “ when he
came into the bedroom. I exclaimed, ‘ Hullo I what do you
want here?' He then said, ‘lf you aren’t coming out of this
house, lam come to give you a good hiding.’ I said, 'No,
you don t,’ and got off the bed and seined him by the neck. I
threw him back on the bed, got a handkerchief that was on
the bed, and tied his two hands behind him. I took a strap
and a piece of rope that was on the floor and tied his feet to
his hands. I then told him to take off hia clothes, but he
said he would not, for me to take them off. I took him at
his word, and took hia clothes off. I then got an old shirt of
my brother-in-law s without sleeves, and a petticoat of my
own, and put them on him. I then got a tin containing red
paint and a brush, and painted hia face at d head all over. I
then dragged him outside, and thrashed him with the piece
of rope. I thought that did not hurt him enough, and I got
a whip and thrashed him with it till ire cried out murder.
One of Mr. Haines’ blacksmiths came round, and my hus-
band walked into the house and put on his trousers, shirt,
and coat, and came out at the door. I then thrashed him
through the gate with a whip, and I did not sea him again
till now.”

Angus Cameron, Chairman of Committees

constantly thus attired. C ameron’s dress suit, it

Mr. R. Burde t Smith, M.P., who has invariably
acted as Mr. Cameron s proposer for the
Chairmanship, recently visited England, and
found that the Chairman of Committees in

acted as sponsor for a Chairman who didn’t

Two women grinding at one mill is said
to be one of the reliable signs of the near approach
of the crack of doom, and one of them shall be
taken and the other left, and what is to become
of the one that is left is not stated, but we pre-
sume she will grind single-handed till somebody
comes back for her. Two white women eloping
simultaneously with one Chinaman is also a sign
of something, but we are not quite certain what
—probably a symbol that when their husband s
get np with the flying party the Mongol will be
involved in several mills and ground considerably
small. At present, however, the Chinaman is
still ahead, and the two ladies who left comfort-
able homes to become the harem of an absconding

come. The event took place iu Canada, and the

One of those stories of harrowing outrage,
Which go a long why towards convincing us that
bilr civilisation ia a ghastly failure, has just
arrived from Kapunda (S, A,). A frisky young
man of 45 stntck that town the other day, acoom
panied by a number of ladies, oae of whom, a
“jwiddy,” of about hia own age, he had promised
to marry, wetting Ms finger and solemnly striking
his breast as evidence of good faith. The party
made for the nearest jeweller's, and, whilst the
widow was inside selecting a ring, her swain
became suddenly impressed with the deep gravity
Of the step he was about to take, and funked.
Pressing a ten-pound note into the hand of the
widow’s sister, he signified his intention of re-
signing the position be held in the underbaking,
and promptly fled. When the bride as was to be
came out she had a ring but no man, and she
swooned away in three acts. We think she ought
to be satisfied : ten pounds ia a big prico for such
a poor kind of man.

ing the revered name of Her Majesty doesn't find
favour in the Titles Office, where on eanh should

youngest junior is about to devote another day’s
pay to this good work, not so much for the sake
of the Fund itself, as for the purpose of affording
his boss another outlet for loyalty.

Shrewsbury isn’t likely to run up many

The blessed city of Adelaide only raises a
row now and then, but occasionally the godly
get blue-moulded and then it sounds as if a cart-

over a number of her guests proceeded to the
railway station to catch the last train for Glenelg.
They were tired and sleepy; Oliver Cromwell
was stretched on a bench, and the others were
loafing about and shivering, when suddenly an
Intoxicated lawyer bore down on them, and
saluting the stipendiary magistrate, who was of

able loathing, and in another instant the lawyer
d

had struck the headless monarch in the eye and
rolled him over. Hair and skin and shrieks flew
through the air ; Charles was disposed of in two
rounds; Oliver Cromwell was dished in two
more ; the Spanish cavalier was grabbed with one
hand and the Roman soldier with the other, and
their heads were knocked together! Rosalind
and Little Red Riding Hood were chased
across a fence; the S wlss Peasant Girl
fainted, and Guy Fawkes had his clothes torn ;
and the atmosphere was filled with screams of
“ Pieece I ” The peaceful city of Adelaide was
shaken up as it had never been shaken before,
and next morning society was scandalised by the
vision of a beak presiding on the bench with his
hair torn out and a black eye, while a lawyer with
a squashed nose and an uncertain aspect appeared
before him on behalf of two drunks and an ob-
scene language. The magistrate felt half inclined
to give him into custody, but ho couldn't quite
swear to him, and so the subject was reluctantly
allowed to drop.

After a hard scramble between two well-
gilded men without any genius in particular,
Alderman John Harris has been elected Mayor of
Sydney. The billet of Mayor is one which seems
hardly worth the row that is made about it, but
as Alderman Burdekin, the defeated candidate,
who was seriously ill, was conveyed to the scene
of action on a shutter, accompanied by a doctor,
we presume that he sets a considerable value on
the position. Mr. Burdekin, however, wouldn’t
have been there on the shutter had not Mr. Harris
nnohivalrously refused to pair with him, and it
was ia consequence of this ill-natured conduct
that he (having the exact measure of his brother
alderman) got out of bed to vote for himself and
look after.his own interests generally. Ex-Mayor
Riley, meanwhile, has escaped from office without
being made a C.M.G , and with less damage to his
private character than might have been expected
on which we cordially congratulate him. Up to
the Bth inst, when the popular ex-Mayoress gave
her last reception, nothing very bad had been
found out concerning Mr. Riley.

local-option letters in the Sydney D.T.
* * - •
For obvious reasons, never be impertinent
to a man old enough to be your father.
’Tis said no man will willingly write him-
sslf down a rogue or an ass, yet people can be
always found right glad to put M.P, after their
name, or Rev. before it.
They have a nice cancer story in the
Sydney Echo. It is filthy enough to make a
Chinaman ill.
We have received from London the first
number of a new journal called Baby. We are
afraid it will be found to have been still-born.
A new “ calf-lymph cultivator ” has been
appointed for East Melbourne. As his district
includes Parliament House, there ought to be
plenty of material to work upon.
Up to the end of 1886, New South Wales
had raised £36,469,138 worth of gold ; nearly
£600,000 of silver; over £18,000,000 of coal;
£1,000,000 of shale; £7,500,000 of tin; and
£5,000,000 of copper.
Rose Terry, the poetess —now prosaic
Mrs Crooke—advises young American women to
wear flannel night-gowns, carry jugs of hot water
to bed with them, wear boneless waists and take
the heels off their slices. Now, Mrs. Crooke
should honestly add that a husband is preferable
to an earthenware-jug any day, and that whale-
bones in a waist are absolutely necessary as a pro-
tection when a young woman is being hugged,
“ Hasn’t Lord Caringtoa a benevolent
smile ?” “ Yes, a most benevolent smile.” “ A
benign smile ? ” “ Yes, a benign smile.” “ Yes,
a six-by-nine smile.” And then we left.
Melbourne Daily Telegraph says :
“ Stonewalling is about the poorest, the most
absolutely ignoble and brainless occupation in
which grown men can Indulge.” Not quite. They
might write leaders for the Daily Telegraph.
We hear that Melbourne Presbytery in-
tend setting apart the Ist April next as a day of
special prayer to the Loard, that He will be
graciously pleased to resurrect John Calvin, in
order that they may appoint the latter to the pas-
torate of Scots’ Church.
From New Zealand we hear that the gift
of the Roman Catholic bishop and clergy of
Dunedin to the Pope, on the occasion of his
Sacerdotal Jubilee, will consist of a “ full set of
the Catholic organ.” By this we understand the
local paper is meant. And this sets us thinking.
If Cardinal Moran were to send to the Pope a
volume of The Express as a Jubilee gift—well
His Holiness would probably send a receipt and
an excommunication.
Messrs, Warner and Co,, of “ Safe Care ”
fame, were burnt out lately in London ; damage,
£50,000. Among the items which go to make up
ibis loss was the great picture of “Niagara in
Winter,” painted by Peter Cameron and pur-
chased by Mr. Warner for £OOOO. The artist who
sketches in the Niagara gorge in the icy season
does so at the hazard of frost-bite, broken limbs,
and other troubles, and so far only one has made
the attempt. It is not likely to be soon repeated.
The Australasian Building Societies
and Mortgage Companies’ Gazette of Ist
December has this paragraph
We are informed by Mr. Abigail that after thorough
inquiry into the working of the company with which hia
name has lately been very prominently associated, he finds
himself able to retain his position on the board. Messrs.
Davenport and Miles, accountants, of Moore street, have
been appointed to examine the books of the company, and
their report will be published shortly.
It must he a strangely lopsided conscience which
won’t permit Abigail to boss a pawnshop, and yet
allows him to be a colleague of Parkes.
Some years ago,
when the Government of
the day did away with
retiring pensions to
N.S.W. Civil servants,
a well-known officer of
the Lands Department,
since dead, threatened to
parade thestreets of Syd-
ney with a violin, on
which he was an accom-
plished performer, with a
label on his breast ex-
plaining that he had been
40 years in the Service
and was thrnst on the
streets, pennilets, in his
old age.
TheS.M. Herald’s
cableman says that “ Mr.
Parnell is staying at
Bromley, in Kent, under
an assumed name.'
Well, what of that ?
Can’t an “ uncrowned
king ” travel incog, as
well ea a crowned queen?
How often has Her Gra-
cious travelled and stayed
at various places abroad
“under an assumed
name ” —the Countess of
Something or Other?
Most likely Parnell would
attract more attention,
and have more people
calling on him at Brom-
ley than Her Gracious
would at Mentone.
This story is told of
a prosperous young Syd-
neyite, son of a N.S.W.
millionaire. He visited
Fiji lately, and, on
leaving the wharf at
Suva on his return, he
bought from a nigger, after a Jong haggle, a
bunch of bananas to take home with him. The
bargain struck, the gilded youth deducted from
the nigger’s money the “ usual discount for
prompt cash, doncherknow." This shows the
force of heredity and habit. It is good to edu-
cate the unsophisticated heathen.
The contrast between Griffith and
MTlwraith, the secretiveness and suspiciousness
of the one and the openness—not to say reckless-
ness of the other—were well shown in their atti-
tude to the reporters who accompanied them on
their progresses through the country. When
MTlwraPh rec eived his batch of telegrams at any
place he tore them open on the spot, and his ener-
getic language soon made public their contents.
Psalmyell, on the other hand, if ever he opened
one in a reporter’s presence, eyed him askance, as
it he feared he might read something over his
shoulder, but generally he retired to his own
room, and when he came out he left no tail be-
hind him. .And he has always treated his col-
leagues as he treated the reporters, and that’s
why he has not a real friend in the whole colony.
Mr, Joseph Winter — the gifted Winter
of tradition—proprietor of the Melbourne Advo-
cate, is being subjected to many petty annoy-
ances through the vulgar curio-ifcy of several
ill-bred persons. It appears that when the
Redmond brothers were out here £13,000 was
raised in Victoria and sent home to the National
League in Dublin. At least that was the way in
which the entry appeared in the books of Mr. Win-
ter, who seems to have been treasurer of the Fund,
But, some months after, a letter came from the sec-
retary of the League acknowledging the receipt of
£ll,OOO only. The conundrum that troubled a
lot of people then was—where had the other £2OOO
gone ? Mr. Winter appeared to think it was
not his business to throw any light on the
matter. It was allowed to slide, and possibly
nothing more might have been heard of it if
Archbishop Carr had not suggested the raising of
a fund to afford relief to the evicted tenants in
Ireland. Now it has been resurrected by the
aforesaid ill-bred people, and the gifted Winter Is
having rather a nasty time. One evil-minded
miscreant writes a letter to the Age about the
affair, winding up with this cruel sentence “If
money is collected for the evicted tenantry of Ire-
land, let it not be squandered in paying salaries to
profesional patriots." Dastardly, isn’t it ?

ROW’S
Dandelion Bitters,
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken two
or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children.
For general Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of Dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters Invaluable.
DIRECTIONS' FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the Quantity twice a day.
THEY PURIFY THE BLOOD AND LIVER.
SEE WHAT A MEDICAL GENTLEMAN SAYS
ABOUT THEM.
Messrs, E. Rowe and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row's Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried.
Yours faithfully,
HENRY CHARLES CURTIS,
M.R.C.S. England.
Port Adelaide, October 30 1886.
Gentlemen,—l have great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s D anelion Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—
Yours,
O. R. UPJOHN, J.P,
Tamworth, August 21,1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned:—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, Indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“lam glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as 1 have
been may take advantage of them.

More than the usual amount of drivel has
been written about George Fordham and his
epitaph—selected by himself—“ ’Tis the pace that
kills.” That the dead jockey intended the line to
point a human moral is pretty clear, but writers
of obituary notices have tdld such tarradiddles
about Fordham’s strictly temperate habits, and so
forth, that his epitaph is made to appear a mere
racing truism instead cf a sentimental reflec ion
on his own weakness for “going it.” A Mel-
bourne sporting scribe, taking his cue from Lon-
don papers to hand, says that “‘’Tis the pace
that kills ’ may seem somewhat incongruous as
applied to a man who lived an exceptionally
temperate life,” Alas I Fordham was a par-
ticularly straightforward man, as jockeys go, ard
not so besotted as many members of his profes
sion—but that’s all. When the news of his death
was cabled. The Bulletin stated that the be-
slavered horseman was blind drunk on the night
before he rode Sabinus for the Cambridgeshire
and that he subsequently drank himself into such
a nervous condition that for two years he was
afraid to get on a horse’s back. The writer of
this has heard Fordham bewail the miserable con-
dition he had brought himself to at that time, and
knows what the fallen hero of two thousand races
meant by “ ’Tis the pace that kills.”

The following letter, written for publication in
the columns of an esteemed contemporary, re-
quires no introductory comments ; but its perusal
is recommended to all fathers in all parts of the
colony who are apxlous to give their sons a fair
- tart in life and a fueling of independence which
is in itself alone a big handicap in their favour
Sorlongabmjy Station,
November 25, 1887.
The Editor Sjrlongabinjy Watchman,
Dear Mr. Newspaper,—
This day month is going to be
Christmas day, and I’ve just coma home for my
holidays, and I’m going to leave altogether next
half because father wants me to tail weaners and
keep the store books, and I am just going down
to the Shearer’s Arms (that's a public house about
two miles off) where our mail bag gets dropped
out of the coach, and I thought I'd write to you
just to ask you to give the tip to a lot of our boys’
fathers about Christmas. Last Christmas 1 had a
heap of fun at home, beoause I've got a whole
drafting yard full of little brothers and sisters
that believe in Santa Claus coming along in the
night and jamming tilings into their stockings
what they hang up on the bed. I know who puts
the things there, but they don’t, and mother said
I was never to let on, and father said he
supposed I thought I was awful smart, but he’d
give me a Christmas-box anyhow if I’d take the
grey colt and go over to Dawson’s place before break-
fast with a letter, and run the milker’s mob into the
lower paddock as I came back, and get home before
10 o’clock so as I could look after the irons while him
and Jim was branding. And I did too, and when
Christmas came I went in with father to the town-
ship in the spring-cart and brought out all the
Santa Claus things from the store, and you’d have
laughed if you’d seen them when the kids woke
up and turned all the things out of the stockings
they had hung up ; only poor little Joe, he got
sick because he would suck all the paint off a
spotted white and black animal the man said was
a horse, only you never saw snch a fiddle-headed,
ewe-necked screw in your life. And there was no
present for me that I conld see, only when father
says he'll do a thing he always does I know, for
sometimes he says he’ll knock seven bells out of
me, and he always does the knocking if he don’t
get the bells ; but all the same, when I went in-
to breakfast there was something in paper on my
plate, and when I opened it it was a Waterbury
watch in a beautiful blue silk box ; and I was
proud, I can tell you, and I’ve worn it ever since
and everybody always asks me the time, beoause
they know I’ve always got it right. And after the
holidays there was only another boy had one t like
it, and my word didn’t they go together like two
twins all the time, and so when I was leaving I
told all the other boys I’d write to you so that you
could tell their fathers that a Waterbuty watch
was the best thing they wanted for a Christmas
present, because you can keep on winding it up
and you can’t hurt it, and it always keeps better
time than the schoolhouee clock, and you can
time the boys when they are racing or swimming
in the creek, and it makes any boy feel good to
have it; and father has taken your paper ever
since I was born, and if you put this letter in all
the boys will be able to show it to their fathers,
and some cf them will most likely get Water-
burya too, and some of them won't, and it will be
all the better for you, because the next time you
lose your mare I know where she gets to up in the
ridges at the head of the yellow water hole creek,
and I’ll run her in for you, and you wouldn’t find
her if you looked from now till next mustering.
So that’s a bargain, and I must go down the
paddock now and get my horse, or I’ll be late
with the mall. So good bye, Mr. Newspaper,
from your obedient,
s'i m rf Tri ■nAVT’iv

There’s a Sydney suburban alderman who,
whenever he attends a deputation, addresses the
Minister as if he were writing a letter to him.
Thus:—“Hon. Mr. Sutherland, sir, &c.” A
fellow alderman who jumped at the idea that this
was the correct thing, but meant to improve on it
by shoving in the date as well, thus commenced
his “few remarks” to the Minister of Lands, last
week “ Fifteen, eleven, eighty-seven, Hon. Mr.
Garrett, sir.” By-and bye some suburban Mayor
will drop in something of this sort: —“A 129-
1292,” or, “In your reply refer to this number.”
Mr. Edward Ellis, editor of the Sydney
Sunday Times, writes to the Press warmly deny-
ing the truth of an allegation made by a member

of the N, S.W. Parliament, to the effect that he
was gome time ago charged with, and committed
for trial, for an offence in Victoria Mr. Ellis
“ solemnly declares that he has never at any time,
or in any place whatever, been charged with any
offence c£ any description, and that he has in
these colonies, in America, and in his whole pre-
vious life in Great Britain preserved a perfectly
unblemished and honourable reputation.” It Is
within the recollection of the writer of this para-
graph that Mr. Ellis, when his private character
was attacked in the columns of a Colac paper,
brought an action against the publisher of the
libel, and recovered heavy damages. It is said
to be Mr. Ellis’s intention to proceed for libel
against tie publisher of a Parramatta paper
which, a week or two since grossly libelled him.
He was in a tram-car, when a lady, bur-
dened with much avoirdupois, entered. He was
on his feet in an instant, but the space he left
was, comparatively speaking, woefully small.
“ I am very much obliged to you,” said the lady,
as she balanced herself on the edge of the seat.
“ Don’t mention it," replied he, gallantly ; “I am
only sorry there isn’t more of it.” This is what we
call real politeness.
The Anglican clergy of Melbourne, having
heard that the German Crown Prince's malady is
not really cancer, have started to pray for him —
their idea, no doubt, being that they may here-
after gain credit for his recovery. If they heard
he had tetanu», or a big aneurism of the aorta, or
glanders, cr hydrophobia, they’d not pray. They
never pray for anybody whom they know to have
malignant disease of the glands c£ the throat, for
instance.
A young man in Coonamble has invented
a new industry. He pals with all the “ boczers,”
and finds out which of them can carry on in talk
and walk, and still have no recollection next
morning. Next time he catches such an one he
taps him with “I suppose you remember that
crown (pound, half-quid, &o., according to status)
I lent you last night ? ’ Some say yes, some no,
but they all pay or acknowledge the debt. The
latter class pay up and “ shout,” and offer a

Pure as the water plant this child.
Grown tall in shadow ; b?autiful ear
To hear them call for St. Louis Beer,
Stop still, my friend, and do not stir ;
Stand close to me and think of her.
My friend sang sweeter, for her face,
Her lifted eyes were like a grace,
The rippled rivers of her hair
Make every thought you now despair,
That ran in wondrous waves somehow,
Flowed down divided by her brow,
And mantled her within its care.
The St. Louis Beer was always there.
At her bar you all must know
St. Louis Beer is all the go.
