ONE MORE
WEEK
VICE-REGAL VERBIAGE
A QUAINT COLONIAL survival is
the Vice-Regal notices which appear
in an, admittedly, diminishing number
of capital-city newspapers. “The Age”
and “The Sydney Morning Herald”
run them for both the Governor-
General and the State Governor; the
Hobart “Mercury” has them for the
local Governor; “The Canberra Times”
carries them intermittently. It seems
to leave them out when there are
plenty of Letters to the Editor, or per-
haps they only put them in when they
think the Governor-General’s activities
are of public interest.
“The West Australian,” most sen-
sibly of all, has a column of events of
the day, and if the Governor is doing
something interesting he heads the
list.
“The Sydney Morning Herald,” as
one might guess, preserves aide-de-camp
prose style in all its purity. It is “His
Excellency the Governor-Getferal and
the Lady Casey” in the “Herald,” while
even “The Age” subs it down to the
Governor-General and Lady Casey. The
Duke of Devonshire is still His Grace
to the “Herald.”
Even when trimmed of verbiage, the
notices make no effort to find an eye-
catching lead but stick to chronologi-
cal order. Recently, the Governor-
General’s began: “The Governor-
General received Mr. Sharik Assid
Gharzuddine’s letters of credence,
accrediting him as the Ambassador and
Plenipotentiary of the Republic of the
Lebanon at Government House yester-
day morning.” After this came, “Sub-
sequently, His Excellency received the
Honorable J. G. Gorton, MP, and later
administered the requisite oaths to —”
Then followed the list of 26 ministers
of Gorton’s Government.
No one is explained or identified, an
omission which would earn any reporter
in the adjoining columns a sharp
rebuke. “Doreen, the Lady Brabourne,
has left Government House, Mel-
bourne,” but no clue is given about
where .she’s gone, or, if it comes to
that, who she is. Cecil Beaton is dis-
guised as Mr. C. W. Beaton, although
it didn’t take long for the alert column-
ists to rip off that disguise.
Today’s Governors seem to work
hard, and to work hard at trying to
give their jobs modern meaning. Lord
and Lady Casey cover an extraordinary
amount of ground, both physically and
in their range of activities. There
seems no reason why all this should go
unnoted, but it should be publicised
in terms which mean something to the
average person, and not as if it is
chatter for some, fortunately, no longer
existing GH set. Perhaps the best way
to show we have faith in what our
Governors are doing is to let their
activities take their chance with the
rest of the news.
GOOD COPY
BRITISH ACTOR James Mason, here
to make “The Age of Consent” for
Williamson-Powell, proved extremely
good value for the Press. He covered
three cities, Sydney, Canberra, and
Melbourne, in a few days, before going
on to Dunk Island to begin work,
and seemed to have something differ-
ent to give every interviewer, including
some strong views on the indolence of
the Commonwealth Government to-
ward the local film industry, especially
for Canberra.
By the time he got to The Bulletin
Mr. Mason might have been flagging,
but he gave us this anecdote from the
set of “Mayerling.” He has just
finished appearing in a remake of
this, with Ava Gardner, who plays the
Empress Elizabeth. “One day, Ava’s
secretary came on the set while Ava
was sitting on her throne and said, in
a hushed reverent whisper, ‘Do you
know who’s visiting the set today? Jane
Fonda!’ And Ava said, ‘Big deal! Jane
Fonda! And now she’s here, why don’t
you tell her to come over —and take
all her clothes off . . .’ ”
HOME TRUTHS
NEARING the end of his second
Australian visit this week, English writer
Beverley Nichols was lamenting the
fact that “Australians aren’t interested
in Australians.”
“Henry Handel Richardson,” he said,
brand >'hing a copy of Professor Leonie
Kramer’s study of the novelist. “I read
her trilogy, ‘The Fortunes of Richard
Mahony,’ at least once a year, yet I
come here and she’s virtually unread.
Nichols...plenty of vitriol
I put her with Emily Bronte, and I
believe ‘Richard Mahony’ is the Hamlet
of novels — 1 it’s frightening to read,
because it’s a consummate study of
failure. It wouldn’t worry young people,
but when you’re over 40, you think,
there but for the Grace of God go I.”
He was sipping gin and tonic in the
flat he has rented for his Sydney stay,
and wearing a bright blue-green shirt,
along with the relaxed urbanity borne
so distinctively by Englishmen of his
generation and education.
At Oxford, his speeches in Union de-
bates prompted predictions about him
as a future Prime Minister. But other
people’s political ambitions for him
didn’t materialise. He became instead a
Fleet Street crime reporter, war corres-
pondent, and, finally, a writer best
known for his gentle musings about
cats, flowers, and the milder human
foibles in his books and in his column
in a mass circulation English women’s
weekly.
But his political opinions didn’t cease
with his Union speeches. In one. recent

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
LOOKING THE PART
“AFTER ALL THIS TIME my paint-
ings still sell, thank God r ” Edward
Ardizzone, the British artist, illus-
trator and author of children’s books,
said with a wealth of gratitude one
would be hard put to coax from a
younger artist.
Ardizzone was born at the turn of
the century, and, with his benevolent
rotundity, his fringe of white hair, and
his practice of peering over his glasses
while taking snuff, he looks as if he may
have stepped straight from the pages
of one of the 140 books he has illus-
trated. Although he travels regularly to
the United States and to Europe and
was born in Haiphong, this is his first
trip to Australia and came about because
of his friendship with Russell Drysdale
and the exhibition of his watercolors
opening at the Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney, this week.
He is probably best known as the
creator of Little Tim, a character
around whom he has woven a series
of 14 children’s books, beginning with
“Little Tim and the Brave Sea Cap-
tain” in 1936. “It grew out of a story
I told my children. I made it up by
chance and had no thought of writing
a book from it at first. It was a slightly
nostalgic story, because so much of it
was taken from my own childhood in
Ipswich — the steamers and that sort
of thing.
“Anyway, I wrote it down and started
to illustrate it. That was very hard,
because if you tell a story to a child for
20 minutes you have spoken 4000 words.
But for a picture book, you can only
have 2500 — so you must go through
cutting the text. Not all the books are
based on stories told first to children,
but the best ones are.”
He has wanted to be an artist since
his childhood when he illustrated the
family magazine while his sister wrote
and his mother edited. But in the
true family tradition he first went to
work at a desk in the London office
of the Far Eastern Cable Company,
until a gift of £500 from his father
enabled him to take his chances as an
artist. “Almost broke his heart—the
poor old fellow. I wish he’d lived a
little longer to see me achieve some
measure of success.”
After the war, royalties from
Little Tim started to flow, the paint-
ings sold better, “in fact, everything
sold better”—until now it is a matter
of matching output to demand. Work
is done, between interruptions from 10
grandchildren and family tea parties,
in the redbrick Victorian house in Lon-
don where he has lived since he was
1,8 and which has always belonged
to his family.
Long before this visit to Australia, he
has been acquainted with the work of
our painters, and this week paid them
a compliment worth noting. “Austra-
lian art is no longer provincial—not
like the Canadians’—who have not yet
shaken off the French influence.”
election, he said, each of the three
British parties asked him to stand as a
candidate, and although he refused all
of them, he says “now is the only time
I’ve ever wanted to enter politics.”
“I don’t want to run down my
country while I’m in another one, but
I don’t want to be tarred with the
same brush as the gang of crooks who
are running Britain, either. I think
the Opposition needs someone with
vitriol in his waistcoat pocket and I’ve
got plenty of it.”
Although vitriol isn’t something one
readily associates with Mr. Nichols,
there have been flashes of it, darting
out unexpectedly from the mellow
glow surrounding the rest of his work.
The most recent occasion was in 1966
when he published his sharply criti-
cised attack of Somerset Maugham,
provoked by Maugham’s earlier treat-
ment of Syrie Maugham, his wife,
whom Nichols had admired deeply.
“That book was written in moral
indignation after a particularly
virulent attack on Syrie by Maugham.
When I was a young man, I knew
Syrie she was ten years older
but I had a great admiration for her,
as did a lot of other people. And
Maugham’s attitude to her made me
very angry. I wrote the book feeling
like this, then put it away for several
years. I was crucified in the Press and
on television when it came out, but I
did have another justification for writ-
ing it, which I’ve never revealed for
publication and still can’t.”
Mr. Nichols’ other notable engage-
ment with controversy occurred shortly
after the war, when he spent time in
India. The experience gave him
material for a book, “Verdict on
India,” which he describes as “anti-
Hindu, anti-Gandhi, and pro-Pakistani,”
and which led to the publication of
five books challenging him, two of
them titled “Verdict on Beverley
Nichols” and “Judge or Judas.”
“I made some discreet inquiries
about whether it would be safe for
me to go through India on this trip,”
he said, smiling. “It wasn’t. I" was told
I might be apprehended.”
As Mr. Nichols sees Harold Wilson’s
Government, it has reawakened the
traditional French phrase for Britain—
“perfide Albion”—and given it a new
truth, but he won’t be filling his pen
with vitriol to record his opinion on
paper. “I’m taking the view that this
government’s reign will be too ephe-
meral. It would be too much like
pinning a battered butterfly.”
Instead, he is writing a travel diary
(“wondering what to put in and what to
leave out”), and he has recently pub-
lished another book, “The Art of Flower
Arrangement.” “Dreary title, isn’t it?”
he said sadly. “I went into a bookshop
the other day and they had it stuck in
the practical section, as if it told you
how to wire flowers together or some-
thing. Actually, it’s a beautiful book with
80 color plates and, I think, some of
the best prose I’ve written. It took me
a lot of erudition. In fact, I suppose it’s
history through flowers.”

Paying homage
to our
national drink
ALAS, THE WALK between wells is
becoming longer and longer. The City
Council has announced the purchase ol
the Kerry Family Hotel, so that they
can widen Flinders Lane. Then the
Cathedral Hotel, also by Flinders Lane,
has closed its doors for ever so that
it can be pulled down for the city
square. Those of us with unsophis-
ticated minds say: “Why have a
Flinders Lane at all if there are no
pubs in it?” And the passing of the
Cathedral Hotel is a serious matter
because this .was the leading well for
the fellows at the cathedral.
Meanwhile, the trend is toward
palaces in the suburbs. Carlton
Breweries, while protesting that they’re
not at all interested in such an idea,
are just quietly buying up pubs to
sew up the outlets, in preparation for
the year of Courage. They are build-
ing a $263,000 beer palace in Burwood
Road, Hawthorn. They have opened
another great beer palace at Croydon.
Last week they announced the purchase
of the Frankston Hotel. They plan
to spend $500,000 to make it the show-
place of the Peninsula.

blessing to a beer festival. We have

rose festivals, begonia festivals, wattle
festivals, snow festivals, even banana
and apple festivals, but this is the first
time we have ever had anything really
worth while, like a beer festival.
It was the brainchild of a suburban
newspaper editor, Ken Dulfer-Hyams,
and the Beer Appreciation Society of
Australia. The country has always
been rife with fancy wine-and-food
societies but BASA was the first to be
formed to pay homage to our national
drink.
Some staff men of the ABC formed
it back in 1962, and they have been
meeting weekly ever since. They have
always forgathered with the very
highest of motives. It is not just a
beer-up. Members are told the aim
is not to quaff savagely but to appre-
ciate beer. Members hold the glasses
to observe the color, they dip their noses
into froth to sense the bouquet, the
aroma of the malt, and the fragrance
of the hop fields. Each week a different
beer is tasted and commented upon.
They even wash their glasses in cloudy
ammonia so that the clarity of the glass
will be perfect for observing the beer’s
behaviour.
In 1966, BASA expanded with a
chapter out at Templestowe and it was
the impulsive new child that organised
the beer festival. Your correspondent,
as one of the early appreciators of
BASA, hurried out there to investigate.
The site was the ancient Templestowe
Hotel and the festival was a three-day
affair. The big feature was a tasting-
competition of six Australian beers
and we were told that Carlton had
gathered them around the country in
carefully masked stubbies.
The formal dinner was on the Wed-
nesday night, and one noted that with
the passing of the years BASA men,
like the Masons, were picking up cere-
mony. The gentleman with the office
of “Chief Pourer” wore a beer tap on
a chain around his neck. There was
also a framed “BASA Hymn” upon the
wall which began: “Oh, Lord, who
reigns above us all, the Maker of all
good, bless all the present BASA men,
and all their beers and food. Bless
all breweries at large, bless all the
licensed pubs, but please, Lord, bless
most of all, our BASA approved pubs.”
Nothing was served all night but beer.
There was beer before dinner, beer
after dinner, and during dinner each
guest had to cope with six masked
stubbies. Even the food had beer in
it. We had beer and cheese soup, and
beer and beef entree. One anguished
lady called out: “Love, would I be
awful if I ordered a bottle of Rine-
gold?” Terribly pained, we BASA chaps
tried to pretend that we hadn’t heard.
As each masked bottle was served there
was much paper work to be done.
First you had to name the beer. Then
there was a form on which you had
to indicate your opinion of its fresh-
ness, body, smoothness, bitterness, head
retention, and glass retention. Also you
had to give points plus four for “like
extremely” through to minus four for
"dislike extremely.” The first beer,
obviously, was Swan lager. So one
indicated that this was a light, smoother
beer with moderate glass retention that
one liked extremely. Actually, some
were not sensitive about their com-
ments. They took it for granted that
any beer would deserve a “like ex-
tremely” vote and they didn’t under-
stand that glass retention meant froth
sticking to the glass. They put down
“glass retention nil.” After all, then-
average glass retention was seconds.
Your correspondent named the next
beer Cascade, the next Victoria
Bitter, the next Tooheys, the next West
End. But the terrible truth is this.
The final score was zero. The Swan
turned out to be, good grief, Diet Ale,
and our beloved Victoria Bitter was
credited to Sydney. The beers un-
masked were Diet Ale, Toowoomba
Gold Label, Mac’s Rockhampton, Vic-
toria Bitter, Bulimba Pilsener, and Bris-
bane Gold Label.
And, you’ve guessed it. Every one of
them was directly or indirectly a Carl-
ton product. Of course, the results
were disastrous. Some fantastic names
were rung in. One beer was called
Ballarat Bertie. Which hasn’t been
around for years. There were 132
entries and the winner, $4O first
prize, was Mr. Alfred Turner, a sales
engineer. Lie got two right out of six.
There were 24 who got one right and
the majority scored none. This was a
terrible shock to us sophisticated beer-
wise Melburnians. However, there is
to be another festival next year, and
according to Ken Dulfer-Hyams the
object is to take in a number of
hotels and eventually we will have a
Munich-style beer festival. All along
the Yarra valley.
Meanwhile, it will be important for
you to swot up on the proper terms.
It will be quite useless your saying “I
find this a very nice little beer, about
four years old, with a strong taste of
oak but rather high in tannin . . .”
For your benefit it has been possible
to gain access to the BASA archives.
Here are a few typical comments, from
recent tastings:
Birra Chiara D’Esportazione (Italy):
Malty, delicious drop reminiscent of
old railway tunnels. Fine big bubbles.
Not much head retention.”
Urquhart Pilsner: “Color sickly. If
I had seen this in the bottle, I would
have said it was a doctor’s specimen.”
Fosters (sob) Lager: “A very sweet
lager type. More for the ladies or the
children. Sparkalarkalarkaling.”
Barclays: “Tastes like something out
of the cellar of an ancient Pommy
pub. Burps well. Not bilge water. I
like it.”
So the BASA chaps continue their
noble work. Each week they contribute
toward an Opera House lottery ticket
with the object of buying Young and
Jackson’s and making it an official
BASA pub. This is a worthy aim. Why,
if they turned “Chloe” with her face
to the wall they might even capture the
Cathedral trade.

Desirable
real estate but
snooty neighbors
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE HATS will go. And that esoteric
fashion message “Autumn Brings Out
the Browns Plus Brights.” And that
lesbian wax model in her droopy red
check cloak. The joolery display, too,
guarded at this moment by a blonde
with great bangs lacquered over her
Mary Quant eyes and bored to sobs
with the whole bit, you know, any
minute she’ll collapse into the bangles
for ever. Because what’s coming as one
of the attractions of “Britain, 1968, at
David Jones’ ” is the most frantic,
craziest fun-thing ever to emanate from
that sceptr’d isle: and just when
everyone here is so mad about the
place, too.
They are going to build a sort of
estate agency, man it with girls in blue
British-out-of-Expo uniforms, and then
sell $lO 1 sq. ft. plots from a field
about a bow shot from Royal Windsor
Castle and HM herself. “. . . Well,
why not sell some of England here?”
asks John Swan, the store’s pharmaceu-
tical buyer who went to London buying
goodies for this British promotion.
There he meets Billy Hamilton, who is
terribly in with Maggie and Tony,
and all that Annabel set and Billy,
who is rather smart on the PR, says,
look, he’s selling bits of Britain in
New York, wouldn’t it be a good idea
to sell it in Australia, too? “After all,”
says Mr, Swan, putting his finger
exactly on it, “England is our Mother-
land. We have immigrants. It will re-
mind them of home. And, as Billy
Hamilton says, THERE WILL
ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND . . .”
Well, there is this acre with 43,560
plots going, minus those sold to Ameri-
cans: one goes all the way to England
last winter and buries a time capsule
in his plot to be dug up 1000 years
later. A nutcase, says Mr. Hamilton,
who caught flu standing there handling
publicity. And with each plot comes a
parchment scroll signed by the Mar-
quess of Hertford, who’s a shareholder.
“They can hang it in the 100, if they
want to,” he suggests.
Next day, Mr. Swan looms from
behind the Pompette Shampoo Sprays
with easy push-on tap connections that
are piled on the pharmaceutical
counter and says the man to talk to,

really, is Frank Barnes, he’s directing
the promotion. Mr. Barnes is not at
all sure that anyone should be talking
about Britain in 1968 at DJ’s, has it
been cleared yet? And then is whisked
away from First Floor Fabrics by
Charles. No one, says Mr. Barnes,
keeps the chairman waiting.
. . . Mr. Swan stirs the fluff down in
his coffee and lights a Benson’s with
his gold-plated Dunhill. There are
other attractions, naturally, to Britain,
1968, although, in passing, he must
mention they are limiting the plot buy-
ing to six apiece. Well, it wouldn’t do
for someone to go and build a home-
stead there. It would be a nasty shock
for, well, you know, if they looked out
and saw a house going up. What plot-
owners can do, however, is grow a rose-
bush, plant a flagpole, or scatter their
ashes. When the time came.
Anyway, on to other attractions: two
sophisticated Quant boys are coming
to tell the girls how super they’ll look
in Mary’s make-up, Innoxa’s are
explaining how their stuff works on
spotty skins something, says Mr.
Swan ecstatically, that’s never been
done in the world before there’s
going to be Cyclax and Yardley, good
old English names, a model of Heath-
row airport, which is Mr. Barnes’ idea,
he thinks men will enjoy it, Union
Jack flags, Union Jack balloons, Union
Jack streamers, Union Jack bags,
British fashion, food, everything. Oh,
says Mr. Swan, he’s got some fabulous
joolery coming from Scotland, wool
from Wales, but he did have to cheat
a little about Ireland. Not much goes
on at the British end there, so he’s
flinging in some leprechauns. And over
the whole thing, on the ground floor,
where Michelangelo’s “David” towered
during Italy’s turn at D.J’s, will be a
model waxwork of Sir Winston
Churchill. “I think,” says Mr. Swan,
“it would be best if you didn’t tell
Mr. Barnes I told you all this.”
Frank Barnes is back with his crease-
resistant and uncrushable woollens and
sits beneath a photograph of the DJ
cricket team, taken some years ago.
Sorry about that, he says, no one keeps
the chairman waiting. Now about those
little square-foot plots: actually it is
the immigrant they hope to appeal to,
not, as in America, the snob. They’re
starting off with 500 in Perth, to see
how it goes, then moving to Adelaide,
Sydney, Canberra, Wollongong, Bris-
bane, Wagga Wagga, and finally com-
ing to rest at Newcastle in July. They
were sending indentures from Eng-
land, well, it would be nice to have
the postmark, but it took too long. By
then, says Mr. Barnes, allowing himself
a smile, the thrill would have gone.
Actually, says Mr. Swan, going down
the escalator, the whole promotion’s
going smoothly. Things might get a
little heated over who gets what space,
but at the moment everyone’s very
platonic.
Back in the Motherland, Billy
Hamilton packs off to a health farm.
He is exhausted.

MARGIN
Looking upon
the sauce when
it is red
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
I WAS TOLD once by the boarders at
Scotch College, Melbourne —where I
was a day boy—that the headmaster’s
wife had banished tomato sauce from
the dining-room. The reason she gave
was that “it heated the blood of the
boys.” I need hardly add that the
prohibition had the opposite effect to
that intended. The more forward
boarders would take a furtive swig of
Rosella before going to dances or to
romantic assignations at the Malvern
picture theatre.
Opinions differed as to whether the
sauce really had these inflammatory
qualities. The question could only have
been settled by a controlled experiment,
in which the amorous inclinations of a
group of boarders who were allowed
tomato sauce were compared with those
of a sauce-deprived group. It would
have taken outstanding courage to sug-
gest such an experiment to the school’s
headmaster, Dr. W. S. Littlejohn. He
was a man of fine character and a
splendid educator, but his views on
morals were conservative. I became
aware of this when I asked him if we
could get a copy of “The Forsyte Saga”
for the school library. He shook his
head and said: “Smut, boy, smut!”
Yet his wife’s theory about the stimu-
lating powers of tomato sauce —based
on what evidence I cannot imagine—
quite possibly held a grain of truth. It
might help to explain the great and
lasting popularity of this condiment in
Australia. From time to time its use is
frowned on by gourmets and super-
cooks. On those tables spread for
gracious meals which magazines occa-
sionally depict in full color, one searches
in vain for a bottle of tomato sauce.
But the plain truth is that the con-
sumption of it in this country has been
going up. According to the latest
figures, it has increased from 2.2 pints
of tomato sauce per head per year in
1939 to 3 pints today.
I confess freely that I have con-
tributed to the healthy state of the
industry. I am not an addicted, indis-
criminate user, but tomato sauce seems
to me to go very well with certain of
our more recherche national dishes,
such as meat pies, corned beef, frank-
furts, and shepherd’s pie. While shep-
herds wolf their pies by night, all
seated on the ground, to make the
taste exactly right they pass the ket-
chup round.
The reasons for the disparagement
of sauces you can buy in shops have
never been entirely clear to me. It is
OK, in epicurean eyes, to make sauces
yourself sauce bearnaise, sauce tar-
tare, and so on. “Larousse Gastronomi-
que” actually gives a recipe for making
tomato sauce. It is called ketchup aux
tomates and involves a lot of hard
work, with the assembling of, as well
as tomatoes, onions, peppers, garlic,
bayleaves, celery, mustard seeds, cin-
namon, vinegar, and other items. Yet
if you bypass this labor and display
on the table a bottle of Heinz or IXL,
many sophisticates will treat you as
the kind of person who plays tennis
in braces and has “Mother” tattooed
on one arm.
To some extent, I think, it is a mat-
ter of packaging and promotion. The
Worcestershire sauce people, who are
very shrewd, have avoided some of the
opprobrium directed at tomato sauce
by putting conservative, elite-looking
labels on their product. They say the
recipe for their sauce was “obtained
from a nobleman of the county.” And
Worcestershire is a very county county
not a coarse, industrial place like
Lancashire.
Manufacturers of tomato sauce, on
the other hand, claim no aristocratic
associations and plaster their bottles
with labels of garish design. Some of
these, by tradition, carry pictures of
birds—parrots or white crows—which,
although having some decorative effect,
certainly do not connote haute cuisine.
They leave room for a suspicion that
the recipe of the sauce was obtained
from a plebeian of the municipality.
With sales so buoyant, the manufac-
turers are not likely to change their
packaging policy. Commercially it
could be a mistake to tamper with
tomato sauce’s democratic image. A
problem exists, however, for those who
appreciate the robust merits of the
sauce but find it an embarrassment in
the presence of guests of the fastidious,
Lucullan sort. The best course is to
decant the sauce beforehand from the
Kia Ora bottle, or whatever it may
be, into a Georgian sauce-boat or
antique pipkin. Then offer it to the
guests with confidence, saying: “You
might care to try this ketchup aux
toma'es. It’s an interesting old Mel-
bourne aphrodisiac.”

The fiddle
in the South
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM of
South Australia is a disgrace to the
nation. It is such an outrageous racket
that any sensible person should recognise
that there are dangers in making such
nonsense of representative government.
In more normal circumstances the
approximately 53 percent of votes Mr.
Don Dunstan received in the recent
elections would have been taken as a
gesture of confidence in his Government
and he would have been returned with
a majority of seats in the Lower House
instead of being left hanging to the
cliff. However, it is a circumstance of
this kind that is normal in South Austra-
lia. In the 1962 elections the Labor
Party won almost 55 percent of the
votes, yet the Liberal and Country
League (with only 35 percent of the
votes) remained as the Government.
Even more ridiculous, the antique fran-
chise for the Upper House means that
Labor has only four seats out of 20 in
that chamber, so that even electoral re-
form becomes impossible. In theory the
only way out .of this is a South Aus-
tralian Revolution.
One could become impractically
starry-eyed about State politics, but it
seems reasonable to urge some sense of
moderation in the fiddling of constitu-
ency boundaries. It seems to be one of
the laws of political history that State
Governments of either party tend to
get themselves constituency boundaries
that produce a bias in their favor, so
that they can survive some of the normal
swings in voting. Labor Governments
have often been more outrageous in this
regard than their opponents. The in-
famous gerrymander of Labor in
Queensland was unbreakable by the
electors and it was only when the Labor
Party split that it lost the government.
In N.S.W., 25 years of rule made Labor
so used to the protection of a bias in
boundaries that after his defeat in last
month’s elections its parliamentary
leader seemed to think it unjust that he
hadn’t become Premier even though he
had won fewer votes than the Liberals.
But there must be some limit to
these manipulations and that limit
should be the recognition that a boun-
dary distribution is a scandal if it stops
a party that has won more than 50
percent of the votes from becoming the
government. Where, as in Australia,
there are more than two parties con-
testing an election, it is rare for one
party to get a straight majority of votes.
When it does it should win. Nobody is
likely to turn this principle into part
of the constitution, but the indignation
of the electors should give it effect. That
isn’t likely to happen, either. It is not
that the electors would not respond to
an appeal to their sense of fairness, but
that our intellectual and political elites
now lack that robust sense of Victorian
adventurousness that could turn prin-
ciples into action. Once this kind of
question could prompt such indignation
in intellectuals that their sense of re-
sponsibility would make them organise
in the cause of reform. They believed
in change and they went about it in a
practical way, determined on results
more than the vain display of con-
science. Two hundred good men in Ade-
laide who could recover the 19th-
century belief that novelty was possible
could kick up such a fuss that their
opponents would be shamed into
electoral reform. That this will not
happen is a measure of the extent to
which the people of South Australia get
the electoral system they deserve.
The South Australian swindle is dis-
guised as a means of protecting country
interests. It is an arguable matter
whether, or to what extent, country
people should be given specially strong
representation in a Parliament. But
who can believe that they should exer-
cise the voting privileges they enjoy
in South Australia where, in the
extreme case, one vote in the smallest
country constituency buys more power
than nine votes in the largest urban
constituency and where 70 percent of
the population is represented by only
one-third of the politicians, while the
lucky 30 percent of the population is
represented by two-thirds of the poli-
ticians? It is one of the measures of
Australian prosperity that our country
population will continue to decline
while our urban population grows. This
means that even those who believe in
a bit of a bias in favor of the country
should, nevertheless, recognise that the
proportion of country representation
will gradually decline, even if country
voters are still slightly favored.
One hopes that Mr. Dunstan’s inter-
est in change will now extend to his
own Party. So far he has been more
concerned with his Party retaining
the Government than with what hap-
pens in the Federal Executive of the
ALP. But he should now also devote
himself to changing his own Party
machine so that it becomes more in
tune with the Australian people. There
are political scandals other than the
biased boundaries of South Australia,,
and one is that what is now the Oppo-
sition Party in Federal politics has not
been able to play the role of a real
political-party for almost 14 years
because of the influence of antiques-
who, though of a different kind, are
no less irrelevant to the demands of
the age than the antiques of the South
Australian Upper House. There is still
the danger that the Labor Party may
remain the greatest antique of them
all.
Gorton should say
more or less
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
BOTH THE Government and the
Labor Opposition enter the Parliament-
ary session which has opened this week
with their Vietnam policies in a state
of confusion. This is nothing new for
Labor. It is for the Government.
The Government’s confusion has a
considerable significance. Over recent
years in the comparatively affluent Aus-
tralia of modern times, the results of
Federal elections have been largely de-
cided on foreign affairs and defence
questions, with the Vietnam issue and
its relationship with the Australia-
United States alliance crucial to the
electoral outcome. If the Government
continues in its present seemingly con-
fused state, future elections could be
fought and decided on quite different
issues.
The new Prime Minister, John Gor-
ton, is largely responsible for the con-
fusion. Unlike his predecessor, the late
Harold Holt, who had the fault of
verbosity, Gorton has the commendable
virtue of favoring the direct, simple
reply on policy questions.
But I get the impression that, elevated
overnight from a comparatively lowly
portfolio to the lonely eminence of the
Prime Ministership, where every utter-
ance and act is subjected to microscopic
examination by his political opponents
as well as by the Press, Gorton has still
not realised that simplicity and direct-
ness of expression have to be coupled
with regard for the implications flowing
from his statements.
Take this piece of dialogue from a
recent Gorton Press conference:
Question: In view of the latest de-
velopments in Vietnam, is there any
suggestion that Australia will increase
its Vietnam commitment?
Mr. Gorton: Australia won’t increase
its commitment.
Question: Is that a permanent state-
ment?
Mr. Gorton: As far as I am concerned
it is.
Lucid, frank, direct, and brief. But
what are the implications from Gorton’s
few words: implications that the men
in the Labor Party who are dedicated to
unconditional withdrawal of Australian
troops from Vietnam, whatever effect

such withdrawal would have upon the
United States-Australia alliance, will
not permit him to ignore?
Phrased in that way, Gorton’s words
destroy the claim made by External
Affairs Minister Paul Hasluck and en-
dorsed by Gorton’s two predecessors.
Sir Robert Menzies and Mr. Holt (who
successfully fought elections on the
claim), that a successful outcome of the
Vietnam conflict was more vital to
Australia than to the United States,
which could always retreat out of the
region, whereas Australia could not.
It also makes it impossible for the
Government to continue pouring scorn
upon the Labor proposal to ask the
United States to fight a “holding war’’
in Vietnam as one of the terms of a
future ALP Government for maintain-
ing the Australian presence in the area.
This proposal has been ridiculed by
Government spokesmen as completely
impractical. But if Australia’s commit-
ment is limited permanently, is this not
the acceptance by Australia of a
“holding-war” strategy?
And if it is good enough for Aus-
tralia (which the Government for years
has claimed has a more vital interest
in the area than the United States), why
should it not be good enough for the
United States?
In the form in which it emerged,
Gorton’s statement also has other im-
plications damaging to the Govern-
ment’s case on Vietnam, which Dr.
Cairns (Lab., Vic.), Mr. Calwell,
former Labor Leader, and other Labor
Party shrewdheads will undoubtedly be
pointing out in the present Parliament.
Personally, I do not believe that
Gorton meant to say what he did in the
way he did. I think he meant to say
something like “Australia is doing all
it can in Vietnam in the light of its
resources and national needs. Con-
sequently, it will not be increasing its
commitment.”
But prime ministers and other
national leaders are —. properly
judged not on what somebody thinks
they mean to say but on what they
actually say. They are paid the compli-
ment of being expected to realise the
implications that flow from their state-
ments.
If Gorton does not make clear that
what he said on Vietnam does not
mean a change in Government thinking,
and if he allows confusion to continue,
he will lose the advantage the Gov-
ernment has had for years over Labor
by having a clear-cut policy on Viet-
nam.
It is going to be interesting to see
whether Gorton gets the Government’s
Vietnam policy back on to clear-cut
rails. If he does not, the long-term
effects could be considerable. It would
mean that future Federal elections, un-
like those of the immediate past, would
be fought on issues other than defence
and foreign policy, from which the pre-
sent Government has until now unmis-
takably extracted electoral advantage.

AUSTRALIA
Is John Gorton forgetting that
the DLP has options too?
PRIME MINISTER GORTON could
have spent an illuminating few minutes
in front of his TV set early this week
not to watch one of the Westerns he
says are his preferred entertainment
but to listen to Mr. B. A. Santamaria
give his weekly session, “Point of View.”
If Mr. Gorton knew enough about Mr.
Santamaria he could have detected be-
neath the usual smoothness the sharper
edge of a concealed warning.
Does Mr. Gorton know enough about
Mr. Santamaria? And the Democratic
Labor Party, which Mr. Santamaria’s
opinions influence so strongly? To Sir
Robert Menzies, the DLP vote was
something that came in with the milk:
he preferred not to think about it too
much, but fundamentally he could
recognise that it was one of the things
that kept him going. Mr. Holt more
openly recognised the importance of the
DLP, but he misunderstood it, seeing
nothing but its anti-Communism. It is
doubtful whether Mr. Gorton, who as a
Minister w 7 as away from the springs of
power, has yet come to grips with the
DLP. Like the intractability of the Pub-
lic Service, it is one of those factors in
thepporerw r er situation that he is now find-
ing out about.
Mr. Santamaria said that the Prime
Minister’s first responses to both the
British pull-out from Malaysia-Singa-
pore and to the Vietnam war were “not
reassuring,” but that many persons
including himself had believed
originally that the new Prime Minister
had a more realistic view of Australia’s
need for independent strength than Mr.
Holt, that Mr. Gorton had been taken
unawares by questions on foreign affairs
and had answered off the cuff. Then
Mr. Santamaria commented:.“l believe
we were all wrong.”
As it was delivered, this may have
seemed a mild enough comment. But
the apparent mildness concealed a
quick, deep disillusionment about Mr.
Gorton that Mr. Gorton may not fully
understand. Mr. Santamaria, and an in-
fluential section of the DLP, are not
merely anti-Communist. They also
strongly believe in the possibility of
Australian initiative and Australian
action. Mr. Santamaria concluded his
talk by asking: “Does the Government
believe that Australians . . . must always
look to Queen Victoria or Uncle Sam?”
To the DLP even Mr. Gorton’s closing
of options on Vietnam was not so
irritating as his general pretence that
Australia is a kind of non-power, a pre-
tence that ignores the fact that its
wealth is greater than that of Indo-
nesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the
Philippines combined. Equally irritating
to them is his support for the Treasury’s
foreign policy: that Australia can
ignore South-East Asia because only
four percent of Australia’s exports go to
that area.
The DLP’s foreign policy is made up
of a combination of three elements. One
is the idea that, from its own resources,
Australia can do a great deal more to
develop credible, independent military
strength. The second is its conviction
that Australia can find a destiny for
itself by involvement in the Indo-Pacific
area of which it is a part. The third
is that it is only by active and indepen-
dent initiatives that Australia is likely
to encourage continued American
interest in this area.
To this Mr. Gorton’s present unin-
formed playing down of Australian
potential, his apparent indifference to
the future of South-East Asia, and his
naivete in approach to America make
up a more direct affront than the indif-
ference of Sir Robert Menzies and the
narrowness of Mr. Holt. When Mr.
Calwell was still Leader of the Labor
Party this might not have mattered.
However scornful they were of the
Liberals they helped keep in power, the
DLP could not see in a Calwell Labor
Party any conceivable alternative. How-
ever distasteful they found Sir Robert’s
disdain for South-East Asia, his com-
mitments in Vietnam and Malyasia-
Singapore seemed to make him worth
backing; and however irritating they
found Mr. Holt’s sycophancy toward
the Americans, his obvious if naive
interest in South-East Asia made him
worth backing.
What now? The Parliamentary Labor
Party is developing new, if diffuse and
contradictory, policies. So far as the
DLP is concerned, it has moved from
a bad bet to a pig in a poke. But a
continuation of Mr. Gorton’s present
policies would mean that the Gorton
Government would also begin to seem
a bit of a pig in a poke. Mr. Gorton
probably doesn’t believe it, but those
strong elements in the DLP that would
prefer Labor Government to Liberal
could, over the next 12 months, come
out against him. If both the Liberals
and Labor seemed much of a muchness,
they might want to give Labor a go.
B. A. Santamaria ... concealed

Taxation
Below capacity
FOR A LONG time it has been said
that Australians are relatively lightly
taxed among the world’s peoples. In
most of Europe taxation and the Gov-
ernment sector absorb 30 percent or
more of national income. North Ameri-
can taxation is generally 26 or 27 per-
cent, and Australian taxes a more
modest 24 percent.
But work on the taxable capacities of
different societies by research workers
in the International Monetary Fund
shows just how lightly we get off in
relation to our taxable capacity.
The IMF started with the assumption
that nations, like individuals, can bear
higher proportionate taxation the
greater their overall prosperity. The
people of richer nations can afford
to be soaked harder than those of poor
ones.
With France, West Germany, and
Denmark, Australia is about equal fifth
richest country in the world.
On this basis, the IMF made two
sets of calculations of the taxable capa-
city of 72 nations of the world, and
then ranked them according to how,
in fact, they performed in terms of
levying taxation on their citizens.
Australia came 52nd on one and
57th on the second. Even if calculations


of the sort are a bit wonky as in-
evitably they must be because of the
difficulty of comparing such figures
between countries they do give an
idea about the order of magnitude of
Australian taxation.
If other countries provide any com-
parison, then for defence and national
development Australia could obviously
bear higher taxes.
The Opposition
Piling up the
ammunition
ASK ANY OF the 81 parliamentarians
who elected him: why? At the time
they would have said: “Because he is
the man to beat Whitlam.” Liberal
MPs, dismayed by the fumbling leader-
ship of Harold Holt, voted John Gorton
to the Prime Ministership because they
saw him as the right man to beat Mr.
Whitlam in 1969. Now some are having
second thoughts.
With nine of the 90 weeks before
the next elections gone, the Prime
Minister has already provided Mr.
Whitlam with plentiful ammunition for
telling attacks on the performance of
the Government. Like most new Prime
Ministers, Mr. Gorton has been com-
pletely hogging the columns of the
Press, and Mr. Whitlam’s attacking
speeches have been more thinly re-
ported than at any time since he has
been Leader of the Opposition.
But those who care to work their
way through the full texts of speeches
he has made recently will see the sort
of criticisms he has in store for his
parliamentary attacks on Mr. Gorton.
At the Melbourne University’s “Sum-
mer School on Business Administra-
tion,” just before Mr. Gorton announced
his Cabinet, Mr. Whitlam outlined his
ideas on reform of the cumbersome
Canberra bureaucracy. Now, with a
second postal strike likely to be loosed
on the Australian public, he will be
drawing attention to Mr. Gorton’s in-
action in failing to remove any of the
underlying causes—despite his reference
at his very first Prime Minister’s Press-
conference to an “underlying malaise”
in the Post Office, at the time of the
first postal strike.
Mr. Gorton spoke on his accession
to power of the need to make changes
in the organisation of the Public Ser-
vice. So far he has done very little,
only detaching the Northern Territory
from the Department of Territories
and giving it to the Interior Depart-
ment. Mr. Whitlam suggests the
creation of a powerful Transport De-
partment, grouping together the trans-
port functions currently split between
eight departments. He wants science
policy collected together also, so that
research and extension work can be
better co-ordinated than at present
(CSIRO is responsible to the Depart-
ment of Education at present, but there
is no attempt at overall supervision of
research, which is done by many dif-
ferent Government agencies). Cultural
activities spread between the External
Affairs Department, the Prime Minis-
ter’s, and the Department of the In-
terior should be collected together with
broadcasting and television and run by
a Department of Education. The
Health and Welfare Department would
embrace the overlapping Departments
of Social Services, Health, and Repat-
riation.
Mr. Whitlam is building up to a
major campaign against the health in-
surance services which the Govern-
ment subsidises. Recent studies have
shown that they are extraordinarily in-
efficient in their use of public money,
using up to one-third in administration,
promotion, and lavish perks (one firm
bought its own VIP plane). Finally, the
Labor Leader advocates the expansion
of the Department of Housing to take
in urban affairs. Mr. Gorton anticipated
him when he alluded in a Press con-
ference to the need to ensure that
national development made adequate
provision for alleviating the problems of
the big cities. Mr. Whitlam will soon
be able to charge him with conceding
the need for Commonwealth action.
But not being prepared to do anything
about it.
Mr. Gorton has talked about the
need to get priorities clear and use
planning techniques. His Treasurer,
Mr. McMahon, in a speech to account-
ants last week referred to the Mc-
Namaran innovation of program-
budgeting for the first time. Again
the Government is conceding the need
for change. But as long as it shows
no sign of making the change, Mr.
Whitlam will have plenty to taunt the
Government with. He finished one of
his recent speeches attacking the
Government for being “dilatory in
adopting the programming, planning,
and decision-making techniques which
have paid off so handsomely within the
private sector of the economy.”
The Government has become more
vulnerable on Vietnam since Mr.
Gorton came to power. With a per-
manent ceiling on our troop commit-
ment, Mr. Gorton’s justification for our
involvement in the war becomes more
difficult to argue. Mr. Hasluck and
Mr. Holt on many occasions pointed
out that our interest in a satisfactory
outcome in Vietnam was greater than
America’s, since we are closer and
inevitably more directly involved in
South-East Asia. We were not, they
insisted, simply in Vietnam to keep the
Americans on-side. We were there
because Australia’s vital interests dic-
tated that Communist aggression should
not succeed in Asia. The imposition of
a permanent ceiling on Australia’s
troop commitment completely under-
mines this proposition. Mr. Holt said
Australia would do “what is needed”
to help South Vietnam. Mr. Gorton
is saying that Australia’s participation
will be' limited and that the war is of
limited importance. In doing so, he is
inviting the retort: if so, what justifi-
cation is there for our involvement
and the deaths of young Australian
conscripts?
Labor Minister Bury is obviously
going to be a useful weapon for Mr.
Whitlam. His Chamber of Manufac-
tures speech will provide Mr. Whitlam
with political ammunition for many
months to come. The Prime Minister,
reading Bury’s views worthy as of some-
one on the extreme Left of the Labor
Party, immediately dissociated the Gov-
ernment from them, saying lamely that
they were only the Minister’s “personal
views.” Each one of them will embar-
rass the Government, not less because
the PM had second thoughts about
dissociating himself from Mr. Bury.
Gough Whitlam ... attacking speeches, if thinly reported


Foreign aid
Still too little for Indonesia
THE GOVERNMENT’S decision to
increase aid to Indonesia to $12.7 mil-
lion was hailed in most of the daily
Press as a great step forward in rela-
tions with our nearest neighbor. The
proportional aspect of the increase
caught the eye. It was more than twice
the amount we provided last year.
But in Canberra there is a good deal
of scepticism. First, because of what
preceded it. It was hardly an inde-
pendent and magnanimous gesture of
Australian Government goodwill, The
Americans played a very significant
role, lobbying energetically to get Aus-
tralian aid increased. They had been
saying that if, as the Government is now
saying, its first priority is the Malaysia-
Indonesia region and not Vietnam, then
it must really start to accept a serious
responsibility for Indonesia, Last year’s
$6.2 million was pathetically small
against the $65 million of the U.S.A.,
the $6O million of the Japanese, $33
million Dutch, and $29 million from
West Germany,
The Americans, who have offered up
to $llO million this year, hoped that
Australia would raise its contribution to
around S2S»S3Q million, and moved
everything they could to get this result.
In the outcome they got about a half
of what they hoped for. Even more dis-
turbing was the nature of the opposition
in Cabinet to any increase.
Another reason for disappointment
lies in the way in which the $12.7 mil-
lion is to be dispensed. All but $2 mil-
lion will be used in the form of general
financial credits to the Indonesian Gov-
ernment under what is described as the
bonus export system. Broadly, this puts
the money in the hands of private im-
porters, who can purchase anything
from a broad list of items.
Apart from the fact that this simply
detracts from what would otherwise
have been exported to Indonesia and is
a drain on our export income, there is
also the objection that it is economically
ineffective, providing no lasting benefit,
Against this it is argued that Indonesia’s
most pressing current need is for a free
flow of food to keep prices down and
a free flow of spare parts to get vehicles
on the roads again and boats moving,
and that this sort of rehabilitation is
best engineered through the free
market.
The program for economic recovery
by which Western aid is being given is
essentially the plan of the International
Monetary Fund. Some economists in the
National University's Indonesia section
think we would have done much better
to have given our aid entirely in the
form of development projects and tech-
nical assistance, to which the IMF plan
gives low priority, There is immense
scope for aid directed toward increasing
production.
Under the Dutch, Indonesia had one
of the world’s leading tropical agricul-
ture research stations at Medan. But
from 1960 this has run down. Foreign
assistance could revive it, and such a
station might be an exercise in mutual
co-operation rather than just aid, be-
cause Queensland and New Guinea
might well benefit from its work.
When it is realised that the Indo-
nesian national income is only $9 bil-
lion, less than half Australia's, it is obvi-
ous we have the capacity to help. Total
international aid to Indonesia is less
than Commonwealth aid to the State
of Western Australia, The Indonesian
Government budget is about the same
size as the budget of the State of
Queensland. In this context, it is plain
that it is not resources but the lack of
will which prevents us from making a
meaningful contribution.
Australia has plenty of potential
goodwill in Indonesia, but it needs sym-
bols of its aid to capitalise on this, A
big fertiliser plant or a team of earth-
moving machines (the kangaroo symbol
emblazoned on their sides) moving
around the country making roads would
do far more than tens of millions of
dollars' worth of credits to get through
to ordinary Indonesians that Australia
cares about their welfare,
Sir Henry Bolte
More than bluff?
THE OLD FOX is on the town again
in Victoria and certain parties had
better look to their geese. Apart from
the perennial issue of State finances,
two matters dominate the mind of Sir
Henry Bolte at the moment: keeping
control of the Legislative Council and
maintaining sufficient industrial peace
to keep industry prosperous and
attract new investment. In his attempts
to amend the Essential Services Act he
has both problems in mind,
The death of the president of the
Legislative Council, Sir Ronal Mack,
cost the Liberal Government—the
president has a casting vote —control of
the House. Until the issue is settled in
the South Western Province by-election
on April 6 the Liberal Party is 15-16
down, after it has supplied a president
whose casting vote is therefore normally
ineffective.
Sir Henry Bolte would dearly love to
recapture the first working majority
he has ever had in the Upper House,
but with the ALP and the Country
Party prepared to swop preferences, an
Independent Labor man standing as an
act of defiance of the Victorian ALP
executive, and the great Victorian
drought unbroken, his chances have
been seriously weakened,
Amendments to the Essential Ser-
vices Act were last week put through
the Lower House, against combined
Labor-Country Party opposition. These
provided for fines up to $lOOO and
imprisonment up to 12 months for any
person who locks out, strikes, or incites
a lock-out or a strike, in an industry
declared by the Governor-in-Gouncil
to be essential to the security or wel-
fare of the State,
Commentators have regarded the
passing of the Bill as a bluff and point
to the fact that the Essential Services
Act of 1948 has never been invoked,
The bluff will be something of an elec-
toral embarrassment to the opponents
of the Liberals during the present rash
of strikes, and no doubt the Premier
hopes that it will be sufficient to deter
union leaders from extreme measures.
However, there may be more than bluff
in the new Bill,
The previous Act, according to the
Government's legal advisers, was un-
workable in some situations because
the unions could not clearly be named
as causes of a state of emergency.
Power strikes, for example, like the re-
cent ones in the State Electricity Com-
mission, which maintained a minimum
of reserve operation to keep hospitals
and communications functioning, were
probably not adequately covered by the
old legislation, Now there is no need
for the proclamation of a state of
emergency, only the declaration of
an industry to be necessary to the wel-
fare of the State,
The new Bill extends the boundaries
of the Essential Services Act to cover
workers as well as union leaders and
makes the old Act more workable. If
it gets through the Legislative Council
it may not be allowed to lie dormant
Bolte and Gorton ... Parliamentary problems


on the statute books. Sir Henry Bolte
has shown before that when he is con-
vinced he is right he will use whatever
powers of coercion and punishment
Parliament will give him.
The double attraction of the new
Bill for the Premier is that if the
Legislative Council rejects it he will
have been provided with a ready-made
vote-getting device for winning back
his Council majority. The sight of the
Country Party being forced to cam-
paign in the South-West on a civil
liberties ticket will be a source of
some amusement to followers of form
in Victorian politics. It could even
prove to be a source of deeper satis-
faction to the Premier.
Adelaide Festival
Onward or
backward?
ADELAIDE opened its fifth Festival of
Arts with the result of a week-old State
election still undecided and the shape
of future Festivals in doubt. The count
and recount of votes for the two decis-
ive seats became so slow and South
Australia’s political future so tediously
uncertain the drama expired at least 24
hours before Adelaide editors began giv-
ing the Festival hometown dominance
in the Press.
The South Australian academic-
cultural net strengthened during Dun-
stan’s term of office and is still support-
ing him. The day the Festival opened
81 “private citizens” shared the cost of
a $270 advertisement in the “Adver-
tiser” and signed their names to an
open letter to Tom Stott, the Indepen-
dent, asking him to put his casting vote
with the 53 percent of the electorate
which voted not to change the Govern-
ment. The advertisement was signifi-
cantly interesting because of its signa-
tories, but politically pathetic. Mr. Dun-
stan’s influence on the 1968 Festival is
not readily apparent, but his expressions
of practical sympathy toward the arts
(he was once an actor himself) makes
him more of a likely catalyst than the
raft of committees administering the
Festival now.
This year’s event sprawls attractively
through a 50-page souvenir program
and around more than twice as many
theatres, halls, galleries, and back rooms
but is without a substanial core. It
shows signs both of over-organisation
and lack of discipline.
In drama it is possibly the weakest
festival yet. No major classic is being
attempted. The next best thing is Peter
O’Shaughnessy’s production of Far-
quhar’s “The Recruiting Officer,” which
is gallant, inventive, and as professional
as O’Shaughnessy himself, but at the
end is no more than routinely inter-
esting. The two plays which the Festival
loudly and proudly commissioned are
disappointments and seem to have been
selected by one of the administration’s
many committees.
Musically, the Festival is strong, so
strong that the need for a Festival con-
cert hall is desperately urgent; and on a
clear day you can see exhibitions of
paintings stretching beyond the suburbs
and into the hills. The rest of the
formal program is an uneasy mixture of
yesterday’s optimism and someone’s
fear that the Festival doesn’t have
enough variety.
Writer’s Week has become a self-
contained success, and this year, despite
the withdrawal of star guests Edna
O’Brien and Anthony Burgess Bur-
gess at the last minute has drawn at
least a couple of hundred Australian
and overseas writers from their lairs.
There are signs that the Festival is
becoming uncontrollably large and does
not have a real sense of direction. Aca-
demics and cultural sympathisers on the
“Keep Dunstan” platform believe that
he was trying to give the Festival a
deeper purpose and, more importantly,
trying to stop Adelaide’s cultural ebb
between Festivals by creating a Per-
forming Arts Council, allocating funds
for a professional repertory company,
and by getting the proposed Festival
Hall built.
Western Australian elections
Flying feathers
PERTH’S former town planner, Mr.
Paul Ritter, owner of the fastest lip in
the West, usually manages to obscure
himself and the issues he has raised
behind the flying feathers of his latest
controversy. Little wonder that voters in
the Perth electorate for the March 23
State election will be a little dazzled by
it all considering (i) that his policy
speech is rendered in poetry on the
back of his dodgers, (ii) that his latest
pamphlet, entitled Concert Hall Scan-
dal, is soon to appear, (iii) that he is
entering politics on the basis of being
non-political, and (iv) that he has
heaped new imponderables on an
already complex situation in the elec-
torate.
Although he is acknowledged a fine
planner, this aspect of his make-up has
been over-shadowed lately by his versa-
tility (news analyst, pamphleteer, poor
man’s Dr. Grantely Dick Read), flair
for controversy, and optimism. ‘T was
moderately optimistic on standing,” he
says, “but after going around 200
houses, I was astonished at the support
being offered to me.” He is optimistic
enough to see himself as the independ-
ent who might hold balance of power,
South Australian-style, and has already
talked this over without committing
Ritter .. .astonished at the support
himself with the Leader of the
Opposition, Mr. John Tonkin.
The concert hall he writes of has also
been taken up by Perth’s Lord Mayor,
Mr. Tom (the Cheap Grocer) Wardle,
who has backed Mr. Ritter on previous
issues. Mr. Wardle has called the State
Government absurd in its tardiness over
deciding about a concert hall for Perth;
the business has stalemated between the
two bodies because they cannot decide
whether the site will accommodate just
a concert hall or a concert hall/town
hall complex. The Perth electorate
largely old, unpretentious inner suburbs
doesn’t give a hoot. Interest is more
on whether or not Mr. Peter Durack
can retain the almost imperceptible
swing to Liberals that gave him a six-
vote primary count lead at the last elec-
tion.
Three factors will be decisive in
the coming State-wide elections: the
effect of redistribution which has
brought in one extra Lower House elec-
torate; retirements, notably of some old
Labor men; and DLP preferences.
Liberals and Labor hold 21 seats each,
and the Government majority comes
from the Country Party’s eight Mem-
bers. Only the most myopic Labor
supporters would give the Party much
chance of unseating the Government.
While the Liberals do not go as far,
the DLP’s State secretary, Mr. John
Martyr, considers the ALP could finish
up with as few as 17 men in Parliament.
This would give the Liberals enough
seats to govern alone, but this seems an
unlikely prospect even to those Liberals
who chafe under the double harness
with the Country Party.
The DLP logic is that in all but two
seats they are contesting, their prefer-
ences will swing the decision away
from Labor. This would cover the new
electorates of Clontarf and Mirrabooka,
the Liberal-held Canning, Karrinyup,
Maylands, and Perth, and the Labor-
held Mt. Hawthorn and Warren, Addi-
tionally, Labor’s country seats of
Merredin-Yilgarn and Kimberley could
go the Government’s way. Labor, on
the other hand, believe they can pick
up Clontarf, and pick off Karrinyup,
Maylands, and Perth. While all ten of
these must be considered marginal, the
likelihood is for the Liberals to win
one of the new seats and two of the
shaky Labor seats, so that even if they
lose one of the four Liberal toeholds,
their majority would be increased.

There’s more to a Shell
Sentinel dealer than filling
the tank. He’s got
a Diploma to prove it.
We think there’s more to looking after
motorists than manning a petrol pump.
So all Shell Sentinel Car Service dealers go
to our training school and learn how to
make your car run the way it was designed
to run. And how you wish it would run.
They earn a diploma in specialised car
care skills and mechanical services like
scientific wheel balancing and alignment,
headlight aiming, thorough brake and
automatic transmission service and how
to tune your engine to run sweetly.
Most times you’ll simply ask your Shell
Sentinel dealer for a tankfull
of Super Shell, but some day you will want
something more.
That’s when it’s good to' know you
can be sure of your Shell Sentinel dealer’s
skills. Look for the Sentinel sign and
get that sure feeling knowing your car’s
running the way it should.

OVERSEAS
Vietnam: who wins
the countryside?
THE NEXT FEW months will decide
whether the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment still has any claim to be a national
government, and not just the ruler of
towns and cities. Saigon admits that
the Viet Cong’s Tet offensive has
created a vacuum in the countryside.
Although the Viet Cong mostly by-
passed the villages when they launched
their attack, Government forces with-
drew from the countryside to meet the
threat against the towns. The problem
now is for the Government to get back
into the countryside before the other
side has a chance to exploit the situa-
tion. And this, is probably just what the
Communists are thinking, too.
The Viet Cong are now claiming to
have “swept away” Saigon’s grip from
“almost all rural areas” and to have
“liberated” 1,200,000 peasants. These
claims can be read as statements of
Communist intentions rather than as
fact. Whether or not they planned the
Tet offensive with the aim of clearing
the countryside, both Hanoi and the
National Liberation Front have made it
clear that they believe that now is their
big chance to do so.
It is still almost impossible to find
out who controls what. But the picture
that is emerging is not encouraging for
the Americans and the South Viet-
namese. The Americans believe that the
pacification program has been “seri-
ously” hurt in 13 provinces, “moder-
ately” damaged in 16, and only slightly
affected in the remaining 15. The dam-
age has been most serious in the two
politically most important parts of the
country the northern provinces and
the Mekong Delta in the south, where
the bulk of South Vietnam’s peasants
live. Most of the losses were caused by
the withdrawal of the Government-
sponsored Revolutionary Development
teams from their hamlets to help de-
fend the towns.
What made matters worse was the
coincidence that Tet is the time for the
changeover of most of these village-
reconstruction units to new hamlets.
The strength of the teams still out in
the hamlets seems to range from a
meagre five or six up to the full com-
plement of 59. The Americans claim
that the average strength of the remain-
ing teams is around 40. But how many
teams are there?
In theory, all Revolutionary Develop-
ment teams were meant to return to
their hamlets by March 1. Reports from
the Mekong Delta last week suggest that
this has not happened. One reason may
be that the Government and the Ameri-
cans are hurriedly reappraising the
whole “pacification” effort. In the
northern I Corps region, for example,
the Americans think that the program
should now be concentrated only on the
most favorable areas and that those
that have resisted pacification in the
past should be abandoned, at least for
the time being. This is called “cutting
out the frills.”
Few people in Saigon question the
difficulties ahead. There is consider-
able concern about the psychological
impact of the precipitate departure of
the Revolutionary Development teams,
sometimes accompanied by their sup-
porting army troops, on the peasants
they were supposed to be protecting.
Many of the hamlets that the Govern-
ment is now trying to win, particularly
in the Delta, have already swopped
hands two or three times in the past
ten years. Each time this happens
the Government’s job gets harder.
The most pressing problem is still
the immediate military threat from the
Viet Cong. The Communist forces are
keeping up pressure on the main pro-
vincial towns, many of which were
shelled again last week. In one or two
towns, such as Kontum in the highlands
and Ca Mau at the tip of the Delta,
the shelling was followed up by ground
attacks. These tactics are forcing local
military commanders to keep their
troops ready to defend the towns.
In the Delta, General Minh, the com-
mander of the able 21st division, brings
his men back from the paddy fields
every night to protect the provincial
capital of Bac Lieu. At My Tho, 40
miles south-west of Saigon, the number
of encircling Viet Cong battalions is
believed to have increased recently
from four to seven.
The main cities in the central high-
lands, the Americans say, are now more
or less cut off from the countryside.
But here the situation is unique, because
the Government is challenged in the
rural areas not only by the Viet Cong
but also by the Montagnard tribesmen.
The only encouraging thing for the
Government is that the Montagnards
Marines duck as a helicopter under
enemy fire makes the run into Khe
Sanh.
are no fonder of the Viet Cong than
of Saigon, particularly after the damage
done to Montagnard villages during the
Tet offensive.
Some Americans argue that although
the Viet Cong have succeeded in
immobilising Government forces, they
may not be able to exploit this advan-
tage. They say that the local Viet Cong
units which were the main threat to
pacification were the very units which
took the heaviest beating in the Tet
fighting. This may be so. But there is
evidence that Viet Cong strength in
the rural areas is increasing in spite
of their military concentration on the
towns. Some American officials in the
Delta fear that the Communists may
already have exceeded their pre-Tet
strength of 80,000 in this vital area.
American civilian advisers who used to
oppose increasing American forces in
the Delta for political reasons are now
saying that more American troops there
are essential.
Before Tet the Government hoped
that the Delta would deliver some
300,000 tons of rice to Saigon this year.
Now Vietnamese economic officials will
be pleased if they get 200,000. r The
other third is written off to the Viet
Cong. Communications are another
indicator. Lorries along Route Four
from Saigon into the Delta now have
to go in daily convoy, as do barges
along the canals. The road to Dalat,


Marines peer through an opening in a bunker in the beleaguered Khe Shan outpost
which is the source of much of Saigon’s
fruit and vegetables, is open without
convoy, but in the past four or five
days the Communists have put up
barricades forcing truck drivers to make
detours through the plantations that
border the road.
A major aim of the pacification pro-
gram was to deny the Viet Cong the
ability to recruit and to get food. Cap-
tured Viet Cong documents showed that
this was beginning to happen before the
Tet offensive. Now it seems that the
Viet Cong have stopped, if not reversed,
this process not only in the Delta but
even in parts of such heavily pacified
areas as Binh Dinh province in the
coastal lowlands. In other words, the
Viet Cong have put the clock back in
the countryside. It is by no means
certain when and if the Government
will be able to put it forward again.
The gold rush
Can the U.S. dollar stand the strain?
THE PAST WEEK has seen a further
flight out of the world’s currency system
into gold of up to £250 million in
the five trading days to Thursday
coupled with renewed pressures on the
dollar and sterling: and all this a bare
two months after President Johnson’s
New Year measures to reduce America’s
dollar drain. The peculiarly lightweight
incident that touched off the latest
speculative bout underscores the depths
to which confidence in the international
monetary system has sunk. It only
needed Senator Javits to suggest that
America should stop selling gold to
start a rush by Americans into gold
shares and silver, which then turned
into a rush by international hoarders
into bullion. This was helped along by
a rumor that South Africa would switch
its gold sales from London to Paris,
and another that the European central
banks are about to desert the gold pool.
The world is still feeding on each and
every rumor that 'comes its way.
Some of the nonsense spilled over on
to sterling. Probably about four-fifths of
the pressure under which it came last
week was generated by the general
nervousness about the whole interlock-
ing system between the reserve cur-
rencies and gold. But what about the
other 20 percent? A fortnight ago the
procedure of presenting estimates of
future Government spending to the
House of Commons, on the archaic
accounting system adopted in the Vote
on Account, gave a misleading impres-
sion to foreigners. In fact, the figures
married up with those given out eight
weeks back, on January 17, by Prime
Minister Wilson: that time it was sheer
misunderstanding that set up a flurry of
nervousness around sterling. But the
latest bout is more understandable.
For one thing, the Labor Govern-
ment’s handling of its policy on would-
be colored immigrants confirmed to a
lot of people (who do not need much
confirmation) that Mr. Wilson has lost
his grip. If the Government is incom-
petent there, what will it be like on the
economy? Everybody knows that the
facts dictate a very unpleasant Budget
on March 19. The review by the
National Institute two weeks ago em-
phasises that taxation alone is no sub-
stitute for a stern incomes policy: there
must be both. But no Government
spokesman has dared to say precisely
what this implies which is an actual
drop in the standard of living of the
wage- and salary-earners of this coun-
try. Not just very little extra for con-
sumption, but a noticeable drop. Will
Mr. Wilson’s Cabinet order that?
So the world waits, and the reluc-
tance to hold sterling continues. It is
absurd to believe that Britain would,
on any economic grounds, have to resort
to a second devaluation this year, and
even more absurd to suppose that other
countries would let it get away with
one. Mr. Schweitzer, managing director
of the International Monetary Fund, ex-
pressed astonishment in New York last
week at the “wild talk” of a further
devaluation. But what is the world
going to think when there is another
worsening in Britain’s trade figures, as
must be expected next month? (The
February figures, to be announced this
week, will still benefit from the back-
log of the dock strikes.) It could be
very serious if the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. Jenkins, does not come
up to expectation on the 19th.
There is also the overriding worry
about the attack on the dollar, and
hence about the whole Western mone-
tary system. Hoarders and speculators
can cause far more damage in the gold
market than they ever could to sterling.
The diffculties of the overvalued $2.80
pound stemmed above all from the
underlying disequilibrium of Britain’s
payments. The big overseas sterling
holders could not have pulled out had
they wished, any more than the biggest
depositors can ever force a bank to
close its doors. The nervous were en-
couraged to hedge against sterling rather
than scuttle out of it. And pure specu-
lation was no more than a marginal
factor.
There is a similarity, up to a point,
for the holders of gold. The really big
ones cannot afford to add to the gold
rush: this is true even of France, which
has not added to its gold holdings
since the third quarter of 1966, although
its total reserves have risen above their
level at that date. But the private
hoarders and speculators have turned
out to have staggering resources: so
far as anyone can tell, they contributed
the bulk of the almost sl£ billion of
bullion exported from Britain in Decem-
ber and January, this representing very
roughly what was bought in the two
big gold stampedes of November and
December. The British gold export
figures are broken down only by
countries of direct destination and it
may be that some smaller central banks
bought through Switzerland. The only
central banks that identifiably bought
gold late last year were eastern Euro-
pean ones. The big danger is that if
the present rush into gold continues a
lot of small central banks in Latin
America and elsewhere might be swept
along in order to protect their small,
precious reserves. And that, coming on
top of hoarding by the usual oil sheiks,
could just prove enough to break the
system.
What would that mean? The possible
alternatives are:
(1) An “orderly” increase (if it were
possible) in the price of gold uniformly
against all currencies would perpetuate
the weaknesses and inequalities of the
present system of reserve distribution,
although if world liquidity cannot be


increased any other way then it would
be better than nothing, and it would
certainly not, in those terms, be the
sort of disaster that the American
authorities claim it would be. But in
practical terms this might be very
difficult to achieve, because America,
the most important country in the
world, cannot change the gold price
without the gauntlet of Congressional
approval.
(2) The United States could be
forced into a British-style stop-go
domestic deflation that would quickly
spread round the world. America has
not been anti-social enough to attempt
this course.
(3) The United States could be
forced into further stringent attempts
to improve its balance of payments. If
President Johnson’s new year package
came anywhere near its target of sav-
ing $3 billion a year, the effect on the
rest of the world would be damagingly
deflationary. The measures, however,
may not achieve more than half that
target, and even that saving would be
partly offset by rising outlays on Viet-
nam, plus the present rather disappoint-
ing performance of American exports.
The sort of reduction that would be
needed to kill all speculative fears for
the dollar would have to be so dracon-
ian that its international deflationary
effects would be intolerable.
(4) America could close the gold
“window” by refusing any longer to
give foreign official holders gold at $35
an ounce. The United States would
then be in the position of all other
countries in having to support the
value of the dollar by supplying foreign
exchange. It could do this by a combin-
ation of selling some of its remaining
gold on the free market, drawing on
its central bank swops, and submitting
itself to the usual IMF scrutiny by
drawing there. It is very difficult to
William McChesney Martin, chairman
of U.S. Federal Reserve Board, met
bankers in Switzerland this week about
the dollar
speculate on how this might work in
practice: the element of instability
might frighten many people and, prob-
ably, work against world trade.
(5) It is also still possible to drive
ahead toward the creation of the new
special drawing rights through the
IMF, while in the meantime the sur-
plus countries accept more seriously
and emphatically their role in stabilis-
ing the disequilibrium of the payments
system. Probably the only action that
could effectively calm nervousness
about the currency system would be
for the world’s major industrial coun-
tries to demonstrate beyond any
shadow of doubt that the responsibility
for maintaining stability rests equally
with creditor and debtor countries.
For America this means taking un-
popular tax measures in an election
year. For Britain it means an un-
Socialist Budget. For Germany it
means more reflation than the Govern-
ment is thinking about. For France it
means a new spirit in international
co-operation. Asking for the moon?
Indian Ocean
Eyes on Mauritius
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
WHEN THE Union Jack fluttered
down on Tuesday after 154- years,
Mauritius became one more multi-
racial State which has been created in
fact but not in substance. The 800,000
people of Mauritius, about 410,000
Hindus, 131,000 Muslims both
groups of Indian descent 232,000
“general population” (meaning Franco-
Mauritians of European descent), and
the Creoles of mixed and African des-
cent, plus 26,000 Chinese, have mixed
views about both independence and
each other.
More and more countries appear less
and less willing to “emerge.” For some,
such as Gibraltar and Hong Kong, the
choice is merely reversion to their main-
land or continuance of the status quo.
For others, such as Mauritius, having
been “developed” as a result of the
strategic considerations of imperial
power, the raison d’etre of independ-
ence is not so obvious. Understandably,
therefore, 46 percent of Mauritian vot-
ers indicated last August that they were
not in favor of the idea.
Sentiment apart, there were good rea-
sons behind their preference. At that
stage continued colonial or associated
status with Britain offered a continuing
emigration outlet; it also offered the
hope of entry with Britain into EEC
further emigration outlets and sugar
bought at the EEC price of £7O per
ton. Sugar accounts for 98 percent of
Mauritius’ exports.
Sir Seewoosagor Ramgoolan’s inde-
pendence Coalition, which obtained 54
percent, was correct in seeing the im-
perial era was ended and that therefore
independence was to be had for the
asking.
The new Prime Minister’s hope that
the selfsame “strategic considerations”
would bring increased foreign aid and
investment in the wake of self-deter-
mination would appear more question-
able. To be sure, the closure of the
Suez Canal has returned to Mauritius
some of its former importance and
perked a depressed economy up a bit as
more ships rounded the Cape and bun-
kered at Port Louis. The hard fact
remains that last year Britain picked up
the tab on recurrent Budget deficit as
well as giving considerable develop-
mental sums. But is the bird in the hand
replaceable by two in the bush?
Certainly more and more Russian
ships call at Mauritius these days, and
maybe the thought has occurred to the
Kremlin’s naval strategists that an
Indian Ocean “Cuba” is both possible
and desirable.
The depressed price of sugar, the
7000 or 8000 school leavers a year, the
50,000 or so already unemployed, the
still rapidly rising population, the in-
ability of Mauritius’ otherwise notable
industrial progress to pick up the un-
employment slack—all these and other
factors are seen by Western writers,
too, as having considerable revolution-
ary potential. Most noticeably there is
a considerable wealth gap between the
Franco-Mauritians and those once im-
ported to work on their plantations, the
Indo-Mauritians.
Mauritius is one more country that
has got independence on India’s coat-
tails, and, obviously, Indian links will
be strengthened by Sir Seewoosagor’s
Government. But while Admiral Chat-
terji, India’s Chief of Naval Staff, this
week affirmed the Indian Navy (soon
to be reinforced by Russian equipment)
would be in “complete charge of the
Indian Ocean” once the Royal Navy
withdraws, it has to be questioned
whether New Delhi politicians will have
either capacity or interest in years
ahead to follow this through to its logi-
cal conclusion. More likely France and
South Africa will be keeping closer
watch on Mauritian developments.
The French after all show no signs
of giving independence to their over-
seas territories in the south-western
Indian Ocean. Paris will undoubtedly
expect the newly independent Govern-
ment to take due regard for the posi-
tion of the Franco-Mauritians.
This last is but a reminder of the
recent disturbances and of the fact that
external interest in Mauritius will very
much relate to its internal security. The
net result of the troubles which neces-
sitated the arrival of British troops has
been to harden along communal lines.
How far the trend will go is not clear,,
but the danger is the Indo-Mauritians
will be in Government, the Creoles and
Franco-Mauritians in opposition.
Princess Alexandra’s visit for the in-
dependence celebrations was cancelled
because of the continuing uneasy atmos-
phere.
My flight by RAF Hercules to Maur-


itius recently took 13 hours from Sing-
apore - 4 it would have taken much
less from Perth. Many Mauritians are
now going or seeking to emigrate to
Australia and New Zealand, but the
interest is scarcely reciprocated. The
energetic Oantas representative also
represents the Department of Trade.
Russia, France, Britain, India they
may all be looking at Mauritius in
various ways. Peking, too, given the
availability of Mao buttons in Port
Louis. But unless someone has moved
very smartly in the few weeks since I
was there, Mauritius will be one more
Australian neighbor to start its in-
dependent existence without an Aus-
tralian High Commission or even a
Department of External Affairs repre-
sentative.
The last Kenyan Asian to beat the
British immigration ban arriving in
London
Kenya
The unwanted
THE 100,000 ASIANS with British
passports left in Kenya are a confused
and embittered people. Their faith in
Britain has been shattered and their
own self-respect bruised.
Though thousands more would have
joined the last-minute rush if they could
have got a decent price for their pro-
perty or business, there is no evidence
that anyone actually denied a work
permit by the Kenya Government has
been shut out of Britain. The exodus
was made up mainly of the less skilled
Asians in job categories already “called
up.” Jobs requiring a work permit in
this first list included secretaries, typists,
clerks, machine-operators, and shop
assistants. Altogether this covered some
10,000 non-citizen workers, some of
whom were refused permits or given
them only for three or six months.
These were the first to take fright.
But they were joined by many who
had been granted reasonable work
permits, or were in categories not yet
affected. Many Asians have disap-
peared without e”en claiming pay due
to them. The Kenyan Minister for
Commerce and industry, Mr. Mwai
Kibaki, said at the weekend that the
Government was concerned about those
displaced, and about the loss of skilled
workers. But he affirmed that Kenyan-
isation would not be slowed down, and
that non-citizens without jobs would
not be allowed to stay in the country.
“If the adjustment does not come now,”
he said, “it would come at a time when
the attitude of the ordinary African
had worsened.” Yet it is likely that the
Government will in fact ease the pres-
sure on non-citizen Asians. The period
for which work permits are being grant-
ed is generally being increased to one or
two years, with prospects of renewal,
and applications for citizenship are
being processed faster. The deadline for
those in the first job categories called
up has been extended from March 8 to
June 8, which suggests that it may be
some time before the next categories
are dealt with.
Mr. Kibaki has also assured business-
men and traders that they will be given
a minimum of one year, and after that
reasonable notice, if renewal of their
licences is to be refused. He promised
to spell out which categories of man-
power Kenya would need, and how long
permits would be granted for, to help
non-citizens plan their future in the
country. But it is clear that the Gov-
ernment will not give the Asians a
second chance to apply for citizenship.
It remains determined to break the
Asian hold on trade and semi-skilled
jobs to make way for Africans.
Poland and Czechoslovakia
Kicking up some Red dust
THE WIND of change now blowing
through Czechoslovakia is beginning to
stir the dust in Poland, too. It is prob-
ably stimulating the authorities to be
more nervously heavy-handed than
usual; it is certainly helping to make
the rebels, whether students or writers,
more restless. The most notable recent
example of official nervousness was the
decision some weeks ago to ban the
performance of Adam Mickiewicz’s old
anti-Tsarist play “Dziady” because cer-
tain anti-Russian passages were being
applauded with what was thought to be
excessive enthusiasm. Student' dissatis-
faction over the ban was expressed by
a petition and a demonstration at
Mickiewicz’s statue in Warsaw.
Two weeks ago it was the turn of the
writers. On February 29 the Warsaw
writers’ association (to which both
Communists and non-Communists be-
long) convened an extraordinary meet-
ing to discuss the banning of “Dziady.”
According to the correspondent of “Le
Monde” in Warsaw, the argument went
on into the small hours. There were
two resolutions before the meeting. The
first, put up by Party members who
feared the proceedings might get into
deep waters, simply regretted the ban-
ning of Mickiewicz’s play, but con-
demned the protests against the authori-
ties’ action. The second resolution called
for the ban on “Dziady” to be lifted,
but went on to ask for a closer control
over the censorship and for greater par-
ticipation by the writers themselves in
the formation of cultural policy. The
second resolution was carried by a large
majority. This must be all the more of a
disappointment to the Communist Party
because it really had tried to handle
the situation with caution and modera-
tion. It had turned down a much
tougher anti-protest resolution in favor
of the comparatively innocuous one
which the writers were asked to approve
but rejected; and it refrained from
sending along any specially high-
powered representative to harangue the
meeting. Not surprisingly, a Warsaw
Party meeting has now decided against
any further concessions to the writers.
In attacking the censorship, the Polish
writers were taking a leaf straight out
of their Czech colleagues’ book. There
is another interesting parallel with the
Czechs. While the meeting was going
on some workers’ delegations asked to
be admitted. When they were refused
they handed in resolutions exhorting
the writers to follow the Party line and
defend the working class. It is not clear
how much these delegations represented
genuine anti-intellectual feeling among
industrial workers, and how much they
were put up to it by the Party. Prob-
ably, as in Czechoslovakia, there was a
bit of both —although the slow-moving
Polish economic reform can hardly be
creating the same fears as the much
more drastic Czech reform is causing
among unskilled Czech workers. But
if a battle royal does develop between
Mr. Gomulka and the Polish writers he
will certainly, like Mr. Novotny and
the Czech conservatives, try to claim
that “the working class”—which means
the part of it with a vested interest in
resisting change—is on his side.


A new kind of Jew?
Members op the Betar Zionist Youth Movement. .. what will keep young Jews Jewish?
THE SIX DAYS of June, 1967, when
the armies of Israel rushed to victory
in the Middle East, set off shock-
waves throughout the Jewish world.
The reverberations are still being felt.
To the world at large, what matters
are the geo-politics and strategies of a
new Middle East. To the Israelis the
issues are the security and viability of
their State.
But for the Jews outside Israel, in the
free countries of the West, the war has
meant something beyond an under-
standable concern for Israel’s physical
survival. It has led to a new awareness
of being Jewish, something beyond the
surface manifestations of financial sup-
port and the eagerness to volunteer by
many young Jews whose previous con-
nection with anything Jewish was tenu-
ous or non-existent. That was the tip
of the iceberg. What went on below
the surface is largely a matter for
speculation.
The evidence there is, however, sug-
gests that the nature of the response
and, perhaps more importantly, who it
came from could change Jewish life
more dramatically than any other
development in the twentieth century,
including the establishment of the
State of Israel and the destruction of
European Jewry.
It may also turn out to be an equally
dramatic turning point for the way in
which everybody else will see the Jew.
There are some strong signs already.
Malcolm Muggeridge, for instance,
cannot adjust to the Jew as para-
trooper. He preferred him as victim,
as the old Jew weeping at the Wailing
Wall, not the young machine-gunner
capturing it. Malcolm Muggeridge is
having his own difficulties at the
moment and it is probably unfair to
burden him with more. But a Western
world in which both anti-Semites and
philo-Semites alike have had the use
of the Jew as sufferer for so long
is going to need a period of adjust-
ment. So are the Jews.
The world-wide Jewish response last
June was remarkable for its spon-
taneity, for its intensity, and for its
By SAM LIPSKI
near universality. It was remarkable
because in many ways the most
involved Jews in the West were young
Jews, the students and academics, the
“alienated intellectuals,” whether on
campuses in the United States and
Australia, or in the academies of
France. As time goes by the intensity
of involvement will lessen. All this is
clear. Even more is it clear that noth-
ing very tangible has happened to
Jewish life in the West. Synagogues
have not suddenly been swamped with
worshippers. Only about ten percent of
Jews remain traditionally Orthodox.
The kosher butchers have not announ-
ced an increase in sales. Jewish schools
are not faced with an influx of
students. There has been no rush to
emigrate to Israel.
The changes are more subtle than
that. The Orthodox rabbis who want
to see the pews filled with congregants
who have not driven their cars to the
synagogue on the Sabbath may dis-
agree. But I believe that there has
been the beginnings of a return to
Jewish awareness, especially among
many of the educated young, in Aus-
tralia as much as anywhere in the
West.
Whether these beginnings will in
time lead to an observable difference,
whether private attitudes and inner
decisions will lead to public statements
and communal change, whether there
will be anything left in five years of
these beginnings depends on the res-
ponse of Jewish leadership, lay and
religious. The historic question facing
them is how to respond to history.
Such a beginning to an article about
the Jews in Australia may seem a bit
remote to some. It is not meant to
be. Whether they like it or not, and
not all of them do, the 70,000 Jews
in Australia belong to a world people
and great traumas affecting large
numbers of Jews abroad affect Jewish
life in Caulfield and Bondi. When the
traumas occur in Israel the effects here
are so much greater.
For once we have an unusual in-
sight into what happens in such a situa-
tion. An empirical study of how the
Middle East crisis affected Jews in
Melbourne recently published by Dr.
Ron Taft, of Melbourne University,

days in June. * It tells much about who

the Jews are in Australia and what
sets them apart from other immigrant
groups. Luckily, the Jewish Social
Services Council had been conducting
a sociological survey of the Melbourne
Jewish community in the six months
up to last May. A representative sample
of 504 adults had been quizzed about
their Jewishness. This meant that very
soon after the June war a smaller rep-
resentative sample of 68 could be
quickly quizzed again on how they
reacted to the crisis.
Some four years ago, when I wrote
some articles for The Bulletin about
the Jews in Australia one of the more
widespread criticisms was that they
dealt too much with the Jews of Mel-
bourne and hardly at all with the Jews
of Sydney and even less with Jews
in the smaller centres. Since then I
have lived for three years in Sydney
and this article is still almost entirely
about the Jews of Melbourne. It’s not
just that Melbourne has seven Jewish
day schools to Sydney’s one, or that
communal life is more varied and
vigorous, or that there are bigger Jew-
ish cricket clubs, chess clubs, lonely-
hearts clubs or more (and better)
kosher delicatessens, butchers, res-
taurants, and more synagogues and
seminaries. Nor is it that in Mel-
bourne you see more Jews dressed in
caftans, bushy hats, and long white
socks.
Even the dullness of the little Jew-
ish life there is in Sydney is not what
makes an emphasis on Melbourne
inevitable in this article. It happens
because nearly all the serious and sus-
tained thinking about the Jewish com-
munity and its role in Australian life
goes on in Melbourne. The surveys I
have just noted are no accident. Nor
is Peter Medding’s important book. *
Nor is the activity of the Melbourne
Public Relations Committee. Nor is
the evidence of some new ideas at last
seeping through to that bastion of
status quo, Mount Scopus College.
Jewish life throughout the world is
having a bad time when it comes to
,fresh ideas. In Australia, the few I
know of come from Melbourne.
In any event, Melbourne Jewry is
not as different as that. With its
34,000 Jews, Melbourne is the biggest
centre, but not by very much. Sydney
has 28,000. Smaller centres divide the
rest of the Jewish population between
them. Taft’s survey’s results, with minor
variations, would have probably applied
outside Melbourne. “There waS'a wide-
spread, almost universal, absorption in
the Middle East Crisis of June among
the Jews of Melbourne. This absorp-
tion took the form of extreme concern
about the safety of Israel, emotional
upsets, obsessive seeking of news, con-
stant discussion of events, and taking
spontaneous actions to support Israel’s
cause.”
Some of the responses to the ques-
tions show something of the involve-
ment: “Didn’t bother trying to work
during that week”; “Had fits of cry-
ing”; “Was distressed that I am too
old to volunteer”; “Attended several
rallies to support Israel and worked
on emergency committees”; “The
attack on Israel was like my hand was
cut off”; “After victory I felt like I
had recovered from a severe illness”;
“I felt shock—a feeling of both death
and life”; “Didn’t sleep or eat”;
“Israel and I want peace.”
About a third of the respondents
gave this last kind of answer in which
they seemed to see Israel as an exten-
sion of themselves. Another interesting
feature which will surprise many is that
the more “Australianised” Jews were
just as involved. Indeed, those respond-
ents with a mixed marriage in their
family were, if anything, more deeply
involved in the crisis than those with no
mixed marriages. Nor did it seem to
matter very much if a Jew participated
in Jewish community life, that is
whether he was a member of one of
Melbourne’s 200-odd Jewish organisa-
tions, or whether he was active in the
Zionist movement.
The survey tells us about adults. The
response from the young was even more
profound. In Melbourne 2500 young
people attended a rally in the week
before the war broke out. Four hundred
volunteered to go to Israel. Later, 350
more volunteered. Most were students
prepared to give up their education.
In Sydney, a team of young doctors
and nurses left as soon as airline flights
to Israel resumed after the war. A
group of 25 student volunteers went
from Sydney University. Some 50
Jewish academics from two Sydney uni-
versities, who had just not got together
before, met as a group.
Why did it happen? Why, for
instance, was there a greater wave of
spontaneous response from Jews here
than in 1948 when the very existence
of Israel hung in the balance, and
when there was much less confidence
about the eventual outcome than was
expressed by Israeli leaders during last
year’s crisis? Taft suggests some pos-
sible explanations. First, the continued
“existence of Israel had accustomed
Jews to its presence . . . when this
country was threatened these uncon-
scious attitudes came to the fore and
overwhelmed the person, sometimes to
his surprise.”
I would go further. The continued
existence of Israel had ensured the
psychological dependence and security
of many Jews. Jews everywhere were
different before the June war, largely
because of Israel. It was not only that
Israel offered them a sense of ethnic
pride. If Jews in the West seem to be
more thrustingly Jewish today than a
generation ago, if they seem more con-
fident, more aggressive as people, it is
largely their identification with Israel
which has made them so.
Secondly, Taft refers to the feeling
growing among Jews “that it is better
to fight for one’s life than to try to
save it by co-operating with one’s pre-
datory enemies.” It could be added
that combined with this feeling,
especially among young Jews, is the
uneasy suspicion whether it is a
misinformed or wrongly based sus-
picion is immaterial that the Jews
of Europe did not offer enough resist-
ance to the Nazis.
Taft’s final remarks seem to me to
be particularly important in explaining
what happened in Australia. He notes
that those who were more highly in-
volved also saw the Australian environ-
ment as a friendly one. This was basic.
Jews feel free to express themselves as
Jews in Australia. For the most part
they feel secure and do not see any
problem of “dual loyalties.”
Earlier this year, for instance, the
Israeli Minister for Finance, Mr. Sapir,
spoke to a meeting of fund-raisers for
the United Israel Appeal in the Mac-
cabean Hall at Darlinghurst, Sydney.
On the walls around him were portraits
of the Queen, Sir John Monash (who
runs neck-and-neck with Sir Isaac
Isaacs as the most oft-used cliche by
Jewish politicians out to impress non-
Jewish audiences or non-Jewish poli-
ticians out to impress Jewish audi-
ences), variously assorted Jewish padres
in their battle dress, and an honor
board of the N.S.W. Jewish Ex-
Servicemen’s Association (yes, there is
a Jewish RSL). Those Jews present
would not think there was any conflict
or contradiction. In fact, they would
be angry at the very suggestion. This
does not mean that there may be no
problem.
Writing in “Quadrant,” Dr. Frank
Knopfelmacher put it this way: “The
problem of dual loyalty is a real one
and cannot be wished away by
legalising evasions or good public rela-
tions. Jewish loyalty to Israel repre-
sents, of course, no danger whatsoever
to the countries of the West in which
the Jews are living; but it may repre-
sent a danger to the Jews themselves,
particularly in periods of international
tension and panic.”
There is some point in Knopfel-
macher’s view that in the wake of
Israel’s victory the old anti-Jewish
stereotypes may be replaced by new
ones where the Jew is suspect as a
sort of “Overseas Chinese” or “Sudeten
German.” But really this is not a Jewish
problem, as anti-Semitism of the pre-
June war variety was not a Jewish
problem. There is little that Jews can
do in relation to Israel which is likely
to head off any potential wave of anti-
Jewish feeling.
If there is no problem of dual
loyalty in this sense, there is a problem
of dual identity. This is not a prob-
lem of competing nationalisms but one
of overlapping images of oneself in
which Jewish attachment to Israel is
only part. It is a “problem” because
the quality of Jewish life and the qual-
ity of the Jewish contribution to Aus-
tralia depends on how it is worked out.
The problem is older than last June,

to Group Survival. F. W. Cheshire. $6.


and it has not always been so easy
for Jews to talk about it freely, as
Peter Medding’s valuable new book
about Jews in Australia reminds us.
Medding begins with a picture of
the Melbourne Jewish community in
1921 when the Jewish “Herald”
warned that “our world-old religion is
threatened with extinction.” Medding
writes: “The synagogues were poorly
attended. Hebrew the language of
prayer was known to few and com-
prehensible to even fewer, facilities for
Jewish education were abysmal, the
spiritual leadership was pedestrian, the
performance of Jewish ritual was mini-
mal, Jewish cultural life was non-
existent, and Zionism was in its earliest
infancy.” No wonder it was taken for
granted that the Jews would eventu-
ally lose their identity and assimilate.
In fact, Jews saw themselves as having
to become more like other Australians
except for a few basic religious dif-
ferences. Although inter-marriage was
not advocated and “was to be avoided,”
cultural, social, or educational segrega-
tion was frowned upon. This assimila-
tion continued so that, 20 years later, in
1940, Dr. J. Gentili, a Lecturer in Statis-
tical Methods at the University of West-
ern Australia, could carefully analyse
the age distribution of the Jewish popu-
lation and predict that by 1963 there
would be 21,500 Jews in Australia.
The paper was ominously entitled
“The Twilight of Australian Jewry.”
War and subsequent immigration
changed that prediction and the nature
of Jewish life in Australia. Today only
some 12 percent of Jews in Melbourne,
for instance, are second - generation
Jews or older. The rest are immigrants
or the children of immigrants. The re-
sult has been that many Jews who might
have had little to do with Jewish life
and, more significantly, whose children
would probably have intermarried are
active Jews. In the ’twenties, ’thirties,
and early ’forties, outlets for national
pride and identification were few.
Medding aptly calls the Jewish com-
munal attitude to relations with the
outside world at this time the Fear of
Conspicuousness. Communal leaders
were afraid to take public action
against anti-Semitism. They were sus-
picious about the coming of Jewish
immigrants from Europe, even as late as
1939, because they feared this would
increase anti-Semitism and because
they saw it as a threat to their estab-
lished position in Australian society.
One fantastic directive to the immi-
grants cited by Medding was published
in the “Jewish News” of May, 1939. It
came from communal leaders anxious
to “Australianise” the newcomers and
to warn them not to draw attention to
themselves:
“Above all, do not speak German in
the streets and in the trams. Modulate
The Governor-General, Lord Casey, walks through a guard-of-honor of Scouts at
the 90th-anniversary celebrations of the Sydney Synagogue this month
your voices. Do not make yourself
conspicuous anywhere by walking with
a group of persons, all of whom are
loudly speaking a foreign language.
Remember that the welfare of the old-
established Jewish communities in Aus-
tralia, as well as of every immigrant,
depends upon your personal behaviour.
Jews collectively are judged by indi-
viduals. You, personally, have a very
grave responsibility.”
This approach led to a period of
bitterness between the long-established
Jews and the newcomers; much of this
has died down. There are still occa-
sional critical occasions when the gulf
between the groups becomes apparent,
a gulf between those who have
experienced European anti-Semitism
and the older, established Australian-
born Jews. But ,even for the new-
comers there is less and less concern
today with anti-Semitism in Australia.
Few see it as a major problem. Most
Jews are concerned about how the next
generation is going to remain Jewish.
Where, then, is this community, so-
markedly changed by migration, head-
ing now? In Medding’s view it is
moving from “the fear of conspicuous-
ness” in the direction of “cultural
pluralism.” Such an ideology
“emphasises group distinctiveness, en-
abling the contributions to societies as a
whole of different groups as groups.”
This does not mean the same thing
as the contribution of Jews as citizens.
Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir John Monash
are not examples of cultural pluralism.
Jewish know-how in the clothing trade
may have made a contribution to Aus-
tralia; this is hardly cultural pluralism.
When Jewish leaders speak of the con-
tribution of the Jewish community they
are usually talking about the contribu-
tion of Europeans who happen to be
Jews. There is nothing especially Jew-
ish about their contribution in the same
sense that there is something quite dis-
tinctively Roman Catholic or Presby-
terian about aspects of Australian life.
When Medding says that the com-
munity is moving in the direction of
“cultural pluralism” I think he is being
optimistic.
As far as I can tell, such an approach
which sees a special relationship be-
tween ethnic groups and the rest of
Australian society is still restricted to a
handful of sociologists like Medding, an
even smaller handful (three to be exact)
of sophisticated communal leaders, and
one or two trendy rabbis with limited
influence. The Jewish community, in
its public statements, may sound as if
it is moving in the direction of cul-
tural pluralism. The reality seems to
be that they are stuck for a generation
at least in the mould of shtetl politics
the politics of the East European
village.
This means that Jews act as if they
are cultural pluralists when their own
immediate communal interests are
threatened.
It becomes clear, however, that they


are far from understanding the role of
a minority group in pluralistic culture
when it comes to broader issues. A
classic example is the vexed question
of Christian instruction being given to
children as part of the Social Studies
syllabus in New South Wales schools.
Understandably, Jews have protested
long and loud as a community and
through a number of Jewish organisa-
tions. They have sought help from
others, non-Jews, who believe that the
instruction is illegal or wrong in prin-
ciple.
Yet, a few years ago, when State Aid
was a major political issue, neither the
Jewish community nor any of its major
organisations expressed a point of view
as Jews. Even though State Aid was
in the interests of Jewish schools, the
absence of it was not crucial. So the
feeling was strong that Jews must not
stand up and be counted on a sensitive
political issue which did not actually
pose a threat to the rights of Jews.
This seems a self-centred attitude in
many ways, which is likely to change
if “cultural pluralism” becomes a
reality but not for a while.
What keeps Jews together as Jews
today? Medding sees three main
forces: the desire to preserve and per-
petuate their religious and cultural
heritage; the prejudice and discrimina-
tion against them not a very power-
ful factor in Australia and third, the
feeling of “belonging” that Jews get
from membership of a group.
I would have liked to hear more
from Medding about this last force.
He seems to see it as something which
makes Jews seek out other Jews and
makes them feel comfortable with them
more comfortable than with non-
Jews. I see the “extra identity” of the
Jew as something much more private
and personal, which does not necessarily
involve the seeking out of the company
of other Jews. In the fluidity and
mobility of modern society it is an
additional source of strength and
enjoyment to have another part to one’s
personality, to play another role. This
may account for some of the mystique
which Jewish identity seems to be pick-
ing up, especially in that most mobile
and fluid of societies, the United
States.
Against these three forces Medding
balances the forces weakening the
group economic integration, educa-
tion, recreation, and inter-marriage. Of
these, the most significant in Australia
are education and recreation. Those
Jews who mix more with non-Jews
socially and those who are more educa-
ted are likely to become most assimila-
ted and lose their Jewish identity.
Medding’s most important sentence in
the book is, “It is indeed a disturbing
thought for a community that its most
highly educated members are among
the most alienated from it.” If it is
such a disturbing thought could there
not be something wrong with Jewish
life which needs changing?
Medding’s book was completed be-
fore the Middle East crisis. But unless
there are radical and tangible changes
in Jewish life and practice this
assessment will probably remain appro-
priate. Young Jews in Melbourne are
getting tertiary education at a rapidly
increasing rate. Something like three-
quarters of them attend some tertiary
institution compared with a national
peixentage of about 12 percent. Many
are staying on at tertiary institutions
to their mid-twenties. A growing num-
ber are travelling abroad for further
study.
Unless the Jewish community
changes I do not see many of them
becoming actively associated. Medding
is, nevertheless, optimistic about the
future and believes that with the growth
of day schools like Amount Scopus Col-
lege and others there will be a partial
solution to the problem of the alienated
educated Jew. He hopes that a grow-
ing number of Australian Jews will
have the possibility of synthesising a
sound Jewish education and a high
secular education. In fact, he believes
that the, proportion of “actively ethnic
intellectuals” is likely to increase and
“perhaps become the predominant
mode.”
I doubt it for two reasons —a major
and a minor one. The minor one is
that Jewish day schools are not the
answer when they remain only schools
for Jews —but not Jewish schools. Mel-
bourne’s Mount Scopus College has
reached a fairly high standard with its
matriculation results; it has prayers,
cadets, debutantes, and laboratories
a very good private school in fact.
But it is not distinctively Jewish in
the way it combines its two identities
of a Jewish school in an Australian
setting.
The major reason for doubt is that
Jewish communal life will continue to
lose its best minds and most sensitive
spirits as long as it fails to reassert
itself as part of a historic world civilisa-
tion with an attitude to life that is
meaningful. Today this is not a
peculiarly Australian problem. It is a
world Jewish problem—change could
only come from a religious leadership
aided by an aggressive and demanding
lay commitment much as has hap-
pened in Roman Catholicism. The
Liberal or Reform movement, with
about 15 percent adherents in Aus-
tralia, is not proving to be the answer;
change will have to come from within
traditional Orthodox Judaism.
There are huge organisational and
communication problems to be over-
come. Judaism lacks a central authority.
There is no equivalent to the Vatican
Council or the World Council of
Churches. The Orthodox clergy are
split into bitter factions.
Young Jews in Australia and else-
where have not bothered to take Jewish
life seriously for many of the same
sorts of reasons which have led to the
lack of concern about their childhood
faith by many Christians. For example,
the generation gap was illustrated per-
fectly earlier this year when a newly
inducted rabbi in Sydney arrived at a
welcome dinner wearing a top hat,
winged collar, cravat with tie-pin,
striped pants, and cutaway coat. I’m
sure the congregation loved it. This,
added to the rabbi’s title of Dr., would
be the final evidence that their rabbi
had really arrived in non-Jewish
society. If there were any Jews there
under 30, they would have doubled up
with laughter.
There are some more basic reasons
which have been neatly summarised by
the editor of the “London Jewish
Chronicle,” Mr. William Frankel: “The
problem of Jewish survival in the
diaspora is a religious problem. If
Judaism means nothing to our children,
they will not remain Jews. And Juda-
ism will not mean anything to them
if it is shackled to concepts and atti-
tudes which are either irrelevant or
positively repelling or call for the sus-
pension of their reason. Today our
religious leaders are unwilling to lose
an iota of outmoded dogma, but are
quite willing to lose a majority of the
Jewish people . . . Our leaders, lay
and rabbinic, are all answering the
questions which nobody is asking.”
Frankel believes the main question is
“Why should we remain Jews today?”
In his book, Medding points out that
the answer to this question has
changed from the traditionally ortho-
dox basic unity taking in all Jews to
a whole range of competing doctrines,
religious and secular. There are Ortho-
dox, Conservative, and Reform Jews.
There are the Bundists, anachronistic
survivors of a non-revolutionary Marx-
ism, there are Yiddishists, there are
Zionists all along the political spectrum
from Left to Right. There are agnostic
and atheistic Jews, cultural Jews, and
what Medding calls “social” Jews
those who have no involvement with
Judaism except that they have not
taken the deliberate step of conversion.
Certainly all this is true. But when
the European generation which is res-
ponsible for much of the variety in the
secular Jewish life passes on there will
be only the religious expression left.
This is happening already. There is
a whole variety of expression on the
religious side from Ultra-Right to
the most swinging New Left Reform
rabbis. What they all lack in any
degree which will attract the young
Jews of the coming generations in large
numbers is a sense of history and
change. The existence of Israel has not
proved to be the universal panacea,
although it has done a great deal
which would enable changes to be
made.
It would be the final irony if the
people which first gave the Western
world the sense of the historic sur-
vived outside Israel only as a curiosity
instead of a civilisation because its
leaders were not up to their historic
tasks.


The weasels of pop
A burst of indignation about popular music from the British author
ANTHONY BURGESS
I WAS once, in the days when I had
a different name, a member of the
Musicians’ Union. I belonged to a
combo consisting of trumpet, alto and
tenor saxophones, bass, drums, and
piano. I was the piano. I was also the
arranger. I did special arrangements of
“Darktown Strutters,” “Folks Who Live
on the Hill,” “Stardust,” and other
well-loved standards. I did a special
arrangement of the bass part of the
commercial arrangement of “Song of
India’ a part that went high up in
the tenor stave: our bass-player was
ambitious. I even composed one or two
numbers, including what I think must
have been the first 12-bar blues in
waltz-time and (in one chorus, anyway)
five sharps. We could all sight-read and
we could all transpose at sight. There
were occasions when the A of the
melody instruments could not be made
to coincide with the A of a church-hall
or canteen piano, and I had to play for
a whole evening in the sharpest and
flattest extremities of the key-cycle. We
were, I suppose, professionals. Our
young man with a horn could sing
through a microphone. But there was
one night in an opera house in a town
of southern Europe when the amplifiers
broke down, and he had to take an
opera-singer’s stance and belt out his,
chorus bare-voiced, as if this were'
“Rigoletto” or something.
Those were happy enpugh days. We
knew the limitations of what we played
but knew that some things were better
than others “And the Angels Sing,”
for instance, was better than “Yours.”
We were enthusiastic about tone and
nuance and rhythm, but not intoxicated.
We were dubious about what we read in
“Melody Maker.” “That gal,” said one
ebullient review, “just slides from note
to note. Wow!” Yes, we mumbled: por-
tamento. The vices of the traditional
way were being elevated into progres-
sive virtues. There was a lot of plagiar-
ism, and this accorded oddly with a
jealousy that wouldn’t let a novelist
quote two lines from a song without
acknowledging copyright. One slow fox-
trot had pure Tchaikovsky in its outer
24 bars and pure Sibelius in its middle
eight. “Moon Love” was the andante
cantabile from Tchaikovsky’s Fifth.
There were ballyhoo and hyperbole,
short-necked, sweat-dewed promoters.
There was dirt, ignorance, and cynicism
in a world ostensibly dedicated to
simple pleasure. It was a relief to turn,
at the end of the night’s gig, to jazz.
We played jazz for our own pleasure.
In those days there were as yet few
cooing aficionados who thought it pos-
sible to understand jazz without being
able to sound a note of it. Jazz was
incorrupt, not yet taken up by poets
in the columns of the quality Sundays,
not yet associated with freak-outs and
diluted Zen. But, of course, it was
illiterate, instinctual, impulsive, alea-
toric, unscorable, unpredictable
therein lay the charm.
All this was, I suppose, “popular”
music. I don’t quite know when “pop”
came in. Perhaps when the piano
symbol of the square domestic parlor
—went out. When guitars, on which
it is easy to vamp a few chords, began
to replace instruments that really
needed learning. Skiffle was a clownish
parody of the coming new order: tea-
chest basses that gave out a pitchless
throb no more; acoustic guitars with
push-button chords (tonic, dominant,
and subdominant). There was the
illiteracy of jazz with none of the
poetry. But pop really arrived whert
electronics superseded nature, and not-
very-accomplished performers were
encouraged to lean on amplifiers and
tape-editors, the one concession to
nature being a selection of basic sexual
signals. Music was virtually taken out
of the performer’s hands, and ignorance
was no handicap. I heard a young pop-
promoter say that he didn’t know a
note of music but he was one of the
best arrangers in the business. “Give
me a Spanish sound,” he tells the elec-
tronic guitars, “and then like a trumpet
sound. And then like all bang out
real loud, man.” One group, the Small
Faces, said recently that “education’s a
dead scene” meaning, presumably,
even the acquisition of basic musical
skills.
I can tolerate the noises of pop and
even the fatuities of its practitioners.
Pop has become a day-long noise and
thus a kind of silence. What I can’t
tolerate is the burbling of the intellec-
tuals about it the article in “The
London Times” on the Art of the
Beatles, Tynan’s recent pronouncement
that the new Beatle LP is the artistic
event of the year, Marshall McLuhan’s
statement in a scholarly conference
about “the Beatles looking eloquently
at us with new modes of sensory per-
ception.” God help us, the Beatles are
nothing but hair, dollars, and four
Anthony Burgess ... “God help us,
the Beatles are nothing but hair, dollars,
and four MBEs”
MBEs. If you think you hear the har-
monic progressions of Tudor music
there, remember that consecutive major
triads in a modal cadence come all too
easily to guitar-fingers. The introduc-
tion of the sitar doesn’t mean the
absorption of Vedanta (“McCartney
digs Sanskrit,” an awed beardie said
to me); it’s merely a new sonic toy.
The words of their songs, pathetic
when compared with Cole Porter, are
so vapid that psychedelic meanings
have to be imposed on them. Their
musical patterns are four-square as
Ancient and Modern and short-winded
as little old men. And yet they’re all
right, really: acceptable background
silence.
But pretentiousness and stupidity and
cupidity surround them. If the intellec-
tuals try to sell them to other intellec-
tuals (and incidentally try to sell them-
selves, in the process, to the swinging
young), the task of their popular con-
secration, and the consecration of the
rest of the groups, is left to a sacer-
dotal fellowship which, to me, is a
sort of animated emetic. The disc-
jockeys and the “TV personalities”

demonstrate, vei'y much better than the
pop-stars, what rewards the electronic
age will bestow on the witlessly per-
sonable, the plenidental nothingness
perched on top of a good suit. The
disc-jockeys are the more gruesome.
Once, watching “Juke Box Jury,” I had
literally to go out and vomit. A
twanging nonsense called “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” had been
played, and a guest disc-jockey went
gheeeee with his teeth and said: “This
Virginia Woolf sure sounds a x-eal
swinging chick.” And, while I was
getting it all up, undoubtedly the earn-
est, though short-winded, exchange of
experts proceeded behind my back: “No,
I don’t think it’s a bit like the Spu-
tums.” —“Well, the early Sputums, the
ones back in 1965.”—“That’s like be-
fore the Flood, man.”—“What flood?”
(laughter) “Oh, yes, it’s great, all
right. And there’s the New Sound.”

thickened orchestration that first-term

for.) “Well, we’ll push on to the next.”
And the next and the next. Pop-music
may not just be left to the kids and their
jiggling non-dancing. There have to be
these adults, jeunes premiers manques,
failed film-extras, tanned and teethed,
voltaic with manic enthusiasm, spurting
their vacuous encomia (the simulated
orgasms of the impotent), knowledge-
able in the brief pathetic chronicles of
the shag-haired twangers, bright and
kidding and empty-eyed, their mean
little slogans like potato crisps (“Don’t
be LATE for your DATE with the
GREAT!”), their English either con-
man’s synthetic Received Standard
or maty Provincial-swallowed-up-in-
American, their poverty-stricken hyper-
bolic laudations the ultimate shame of
all language (when such mean and
cheap janglings are “great,” what term
do we reserve for Tristan and the
Choral Symphony ?).
Do they merit vitriol, even a drop
of it? Yes, because they corrupt the
young, persuading them that the mature
world, which produced Beethoven and
Schweitzer, sets ’an even higher value
on the transient anodynes of youth than
does youth itself. For this they stink
to heaven. Not all their stick deodorants
and skin lotions (gifts perhaps from the
grateful boosted) can disguise the fetor.
Dead, what account can they present?
And yet they’re too little for hell. It’s
hopeless to wish to consign them to a
white-hot turntable (45 rpm for ever
and ever), stuck all over with blunt and
rusty acoustic needles, each tooth
hollowed to the raw nerve and filled
with a micro-transistor (32 several pop-
stations blaring through all eternity 32
worn flip-sides into their sinuses), an
eternal Ringo battering the tympanic
membrane, Cilia Black screeching her
laryngeal constrictions into the mastoid
antrum, the semi-circular canals aflood
with the Procol Harum, Stones blocking
the Eustachian tube. They are the
Hollow Men. They are electronic lice.
They are already punished by being
what they are.


DEFENCE
Australians unique non-system
AUSTRALIA HAS one of the most
fragmented, least integrated defence
organisations in the world. The Depart-
ment of Defence, charged with co-
ordination and the ultimate authority
to advise Cabinet on defence matters,
has virtually no independent power. It
is best described as a collection of staffs
whose job is to service a great variety
of inter-Service committees who pon-
derously but surely wield the real
power. As an organisation with clear
lines of authority of its own, the Defence
Department is virtually non-existent.
Almost everything it does is homework
for one inter-Service or interdepart-
mental committee or another.
The individual Services each have
their complete departrhental structures
behind them (with, of course, their par-
liamentary Ministers), so that Aus-
tralia’s is today an almost uniquely
decentralised and divided system. Both
Britain and the U.S. have abolished
separate Service Departments behind
each Armed Service, investing in their
Department of Defence clear lines of
authority over the men in uniform. The
Canadians have gone furthest, com-
pletely abolishing the distinctions in
the Services themselves, so that no
longer is there such a thing as the
Canadian Navy, Army, or Air Force.
There is only a Canadian Armed
Forces with a single system of rank and
various commands, none of which
clearly corresponds to the old three-
Service classification.
However, at last the Australian
Government has the chance to make a
step toward running the Australian
Armed Forces properly. Awaiting
Cabinet consideration is a report recom-
mending the integration of officer
training in a tri-Service Defence Col-
lege at Duntroon. The separate Navy
college at Jervis Bay and the Air Force
college at Point Cook would be closed
down, so that cadet officers from all
three Services would get a common
tertiary training in a Defence College
in Canberra. Only short courses specific
to the individual Services would con-
tinue to be given separately by the
Air Force and the Navy.
These, at least, are the principal
recommendations of a committee
consisting of Sir Leslie Martin, retired
Chairman Australian Universities Com-
mission, Sir John Wilton, Chairman
Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Sir
Hugh Ennor, Secretary Commonwealth
Department Education and Science
appointed last year. Integration of
education has always been supported
by the Army, and the Navy has also
been persuaded of its importance. Only
the Air Force is holding out for the
maintenance of separate educational
establishments, wanting to continue to
build up the Point Cook Academy in
Victoria.
Despite the disproportionate power
which the Air Force has been able to
throw around in the Australian defence
establishment in the past, it must be
predicted that this time their lobbying
efforts will fail. The Government has
announced the establishment of a “Joint
Service College system” as a “long-
term aim,” and its committee of inquiry
has unanimously recommended immedi-
ate action to form a joint college at
Duntroon, and this is supported by the
By PETER SAMUEL
Departments of Defence,* Army, and
Navy.
The lecturing staffs at Duntroon and
Point Cook are constantly, frustrated
by the “remote control” exercised over
them through affiliation arrangements
with the universities of N.S.W. and
Melbourne, and they strongly favor an
independent all-Services college. So
the proposal is almost certain to be
adopted by Cabinet when it gets
around to considering the matter
and construction work at Duntroon,
halted for the period of the review,
can resume again.
If so, this will amount to the most
important step so far toward the integ-
ration of the Australian Services. For
the integration of officer training and
education is essential to breaking down
the exclusiveness and separate esprit
de corps of the various Services, and
developing the personal attitudes and
friendships appropriate to a more integ-
rated Armed Service.
But it raises the broader question of
Service integration. Government policy
is to look at individual proposals for
integrating parts of the defence mach-
inery and carry them through one by
one. Rationalisation is the theme word.
Defence Minister Fairhall and Prime
Minister Gorton have both expressed
scepticism toward the suggestion that
we adopt unification as an objective.
A small degree of integration is
already achieved. Publicity for recruit-
ment is done for the three Services by
the Defence Department, much of their
materials production and research and
development by the Department of
Supply. The computer centre in Can-
berra, when it is finally working
properly, will provide a degree of
integration in record-keeping, stock
control, personnel administration, and
a variety of other clerical and adminis-
trative tasks. A Joint Communications
Centre in Canberra is an attempt to
integrate the major communications
nets of the Services. The Joint Intelli-
gence Bureau in the Defence Depart-
ment collates general strategic informa-
tion but, of course, the Services main-
tain their separate systems. Canteens
for all Services have been run by the
one organisation since 1959.
Another way in which the Services
attempt to get rid of overlapping is
by using each other’s facilities. This is
starting to happen in Service hospitals,
the Army hospital at Townsville, for
instance, being available for Air Force
and Navy personnel as well; the Air
Force runs all-Services signals at Perth,
and the Army does all-Services food
procurement in Perth. In a few
cases, responsibility has been given to-
one Service to do a particular job on
an Australia-wide basis for the other
Services. All medical and dental stores,
for instance, are managed by the Army.
The reasons for the world-wide trend
toward defence integration are clear
enough. Modern technology and the
development of weapons and vehicles
have deprived the old Army, Navy,
Air Force classifications of their logic.
No longer does each have its own
special technology or role. The Army
and the Navy, for instance, must these
days fly planes as an integral part of
their operations. Small helicopters are
as important to the Army in Vietnam
and as integral a part of it as the jeep
in World War II; the helicopter gun-
ship is the modern equivalent of an
armored car or bren-gun carrier of
the North African campaign. The
short-take-off-and-landing Caribou or
heavy-lift helicopter does many of the
tasks which used to be performed by
the Army’s five-ton truck.
In mobile jungle war of this age, the
Air Force is largely concerned to pro-
vide direct support to the Army—as
a supplement to the Army’s artillery
batteries or in moving around soldiers
and their equipment. The Air Force’s
relatively independent roles of strategic
bombing and interceptor - defence
against enemy aircraft have become far
less important. The Navy, too, acts
more directly in support of the Army,
as sea-borne artillery and as coastal
police. Independent ship-to-ship en-
counters are rare.
In wars in which we have air and
sea superiority, the Air Force and Navy


become support arms of the Army. It
is not only in jungle warfare that
technology has increasingly cut across
traditional lines of distinction. Strategic
strikes can be made by long-range bom-
bers, carrier-based planes, or long-range
missiles. Anti-submarine measures can
be taken from land and air as well as
from ships. The weapons systems and
vehicles of the three Services are more
interchangeable than ever before, with
choices constantly being made between
them or co-ordination being needed to
have them operate together harmoni-
ously.
The difficulty with the present
approach is that each time there is an
organisational innovation it creates
almost as great a problem as it solves.
Certainly, to work on an example, the
creation of a Joint Communications
Centre achieves economies: it enables
the three Services to pool their best
signals men, to make full use of expen-
sive equipment, and to cut overheads to
the minimum. But the savings through
economy of operation are off-set to a
significant extent by new problems of
co-ordination and command.
A new Joint Services Committee has
to be established to administer the
Communications Centre. Each of the
three Services which will provide per-
sonnel to man the Centre and get
usage out of it will want a say in
its management. And so the joint
Services Communications Centre
management committee will have to
meet each week or fortnight. That
committee, like other joint committees,
will have no authority if it is short of
a consensus. Hours will be spent
seeking compromise, many more hours
in filibustering or stonewalling, and
when compromise is found impossible
the problem will be passed on, up to
the joint Chiefs of Staff or the Cabinet
Defence Committee if necessary.
If the Army runs food procurement
in Perth, the Air Force and Navy will
want their connoisseurs represented on
a joint food-procurement committee.
After all, the Army has no authority
to dictate to the other Services what
they will eat. So while there may be
net savings at many stages in the
rationalisation process, the overall com-
mand structure is continually fuzzed
and complicated as each joint Service
system is introduced. The Canadians
started their integration exercise im-
mediately after World War II and their
aim then was to rationalise, not to go
all the way to the elimination of separ-
ate Services.
But Canada’s Government, after
much examination and heart-searching,
concluded that the only solution lay in
complete integration, bringing the full
advantages of economy in the applica-
tion of joint Services and a single direct
command structure, eliminating the
morass of joint committees. As the last
remnants of the separate Services dis-
appear, the Canadians are calculating
the gains they have achieved through
integration. They reckon the elimina-
tion of duplicated services alone has
saved $230 million out of a defence
budget of $l6OO million.
They think they have achieved con-
siderable benefits through eliminating
empire-building submissions and bias
in recommendations for weapons sys-
tems. With Services divided according
to tradition, each will naturally push
for the system traditional to it: the
Navy for a carrier, the Air Force for
long-range strike bombers, the Army
maybe for missiles for the same
strategic deterrence mission. A rational
examination of the best system in terms
of effectiveness against cost is next to
impossible.
Unification of the Defence Services in
Canada is said to have an advantage in
the career prospects the Armed Forces
can now offer. A broader, more diversi-
fied set of jobs is available to all who
enter, offering the opportunity for
greater job mobility and advancement
for the individual.
Without the vested interest of separ-
ate Services, the Armed Forces can
adapt more easily to technological
change. If, for instance, technology
makes obsolete a major section of naval
Forces, the displaced units are more
easily placed within a unified Armed
Service than if it is the Navy which
has to be retrenched.
In war itself the processes of inter-
Services consultation and co-ordination
can have a crippling effect on the com-
mand structure. In Vietnam, for
instance, in the early stages of our
involvement, the Army had terrible
trouble getting effective helicopter
support because helicopters were under
Air Force control and were being flown
under Air Force regulations. Air Force
pilots often simply refused to fly in
on medical evacuation and resupply
jobs, telling Army commanders in
Phuoc Tuy to go to hell. There was
hardly time in these cases to refer
such matters to Australian Forces
Vietnam Joint Command in . Cholon.
Responsibility for co-ordinated com-
mand can be delegated down the line
further, but the problem will recur
in another form as long as there are
separate Services with separate lines of
command and responsibility.
The integration procedure being fol-
lowed overseas seems remarkably uni-
form, though different countries have
reached different stages. In Britain,
the emphasis is mainly on integrating
logistical services, with the Army pro-
viding land transport for Navy and
Air doing food and clothing procure-
ment, and running medical and hos-
pital services. In the U.S. the ten-
dency has been to establish joint agen-
cies for communications, supply,
intelligence, and so on. In Britain,
Service Ministries have gone and
Ministers are appointed to functional
rather than Service positions. Under
the British Minister for Defence are
Ministers for Defence Administration
(personnel and logistics), and for
Defence Equipment (production, pro-
curement, research, and development).
As the structures of overseas Defence
Forces are adapted to the functions
they perform rather than being divided
on tradition, it becomes possible to
introduce modern management tech-
niques. In the U.S., under McNamara's
reorganisation of the defence estab-
lishment, the now-famous Planning-
Programming-Budgeting system was
introduced as recommended in a
RAND Corporation report some years
earlier. This forces the Services to
make their submissions in terms of
programs which put each proposal in
the context of a particular defence mis-
sion and provide full details of all costs
over the full life of the system. The
cost effectiveness of alternative pro-
posals can therefore be evaluated
centrally rather than leaving them to
the whims and rivalries of traditional
Service divisions.
A McNamaran approach to a weapons
systems choice in Australia would, for
instance, almost certainly have limited
the Australian Air Force’s philandering
in technical excellence, and instead of
having 100 very flyable but virtually
unused Mirage interceptor planes and
two dozen fearfully expensive nuclear-
capable bombers we might have 150
cheap all-purpose fighting planes to fill
their role and a decent fleet of heli-
copters for the Army into the bargain.
The program budgeting system in the
U.S. provides a continually updated
five-year plan of spending by missions,
which cut across traditional Service
divisions. The missions are divided into
strategic retaliatory forces, continental
air and missile defence forces, general
purpose forces, airlift and sealift forces,
reserve and national guard, research
and development, military assistance
overseas, civil defence. The overall
budget is first evaluated and divided
according to these mission categories,
and only, incidentally, at a later stage,
when the best way of fulfilling each
mission is considered, is a Service allo-
cation made.
The Canadians have gone further
than most countries by abolishing the
separate Services entirely. A Minister
for National Defence is in charge with
four associate Ministers with control
of aspects of the Armed Services: per-
sonnel, logistic services, information
services, etc. A single Chief of Defence
Staff is the commander-in-chief, with
a Vice-Chief of Defence in charge of
operations specifically. The forces
operate as six commands: mobile (con-
taining most of the former Army and
the ground support, helicopter and
naval landing craft elements of the
former Air Force and Navy); maritime
(most of the former Navy plus the
anti-submarine elements of the Air
Force); air defence (anti-aircraft and
surface-to-air missile systems of the old
Army plus old Air Force interceptor
planes), training, air transport, and
materiel. '
Under modern conditions, an adap-
tation in this direction seems an essen-
tial prerequisite to getting our money’s
worth in defence.


SOUTH-EAST ASIA
PORTENTS FOR '71
This is the third of a series of articles by Harvey Stockwin on the
effects of the British pull-out from Singapore and Malaysia
TO WHOM and to what will the
British departure from South-East Asia
give more room for manoeuvre? What
are the likely political, regional, and
psychological effects of the accelerated
withdrawals? Who will think they stand
to benefit? To start with, there are the
pirates.
The looming threat, when the deter-
rent force of 70-odd ships of the Royal
Navy is no longer around, has been
foreshadowed in words unavailingly
addressed to the British Government by
no less an authority than Britain’s own
Chamber of Shipping. “As the pro-
tection and influence of Great Britain
is withdrawn or recedes there will be
increased risk of piracy and hostile acts
against, or interference with, the free
passage of (British) ships in coastal or
narrow waters adjoining countries in
which other influences may quickly be
established.”
The Chamber’s concern was under-
scored in the Singapore Parliament on
the very day Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew was reporting on his recent trip
to London. At question time another
Minister disclosed that 24 incidents of
“piracy” had taken place in the past
couple of years in areas adjacent to
Singapore’s territorial waters. These
have evidently involved some deaths
and, significantly, the Singapore Gov-
ernment intends purchasing 20 new
patrol boats as a local deterrent. It was
also recently reported that there were
34 armed hold-ups by Thai robbers in
Malaysia’s north-west border areas last
year and eight piracy hold-ups, again
by Thais, of Malaysian fishing boats.
The RN departs, what difference
does it make? In the huge archipelago
that swings in a semicircle from
northern Luzon right round to southern
Burma there is, of course, always going
to be a problem of enforcing law and
order on either sea or land. The local
navies, whether Indonesian, Malaysian,
Singaporean, or Filipino (the Thai
Navy is largely, and typically, tied to
Bangkok), can play an increasing part
in controlling the area. Equally the
area has a history of uncontrollability.
The piratical pressure points—the
islands off to the west of southern
Burma and southern Thailand, northern
Sumatra, southern Philippines (the
Sulu Sea-northern Borneo towns have
been themselves attacked by pirates,
even during the colonial 1950 s) —are
not easily brought within the purview of
their respective capital cities. Economic
conditions may deteriorate to such a
point as to make the piratical incentive
that much greater. The incentive is
increased to the point when interna-
tional merchant vessels may be molested,
when there is no longer the disincentive
of knowing heavy naval hardware will
descend if you go too far. An interna-
tional shipping spokesman has already
talked about the future need for
merchantmen to be armed as they were
a century or so ago. No doubt people
will only sit up and take notice when
the shipping conferences put up their
rates, once more, to cover the cost of
such a contingency.
To be fair to the “pirates,” “hostile
acts” is possibly a more accurate term,
as piracy is itself a Western concept
imposed upon a non-Western situation.
Take Indonesia, for example. It may
well remain united in form but become
a loose coalition in substance. Then
each area, as they have done historic-
ally, will view their surrounds as “their
province,” possibly with scant regard
for technicalities like territorial waters.
Their concept of what is or is not
“legal” may well be very different from
ours. Lots of other conditions may help
bring the British Shipping Chamber’s
fears to reality. As one top Indonesian
official recently pointed out to me,
piracy has decreased in the Sulu Sea
area as smuggling has increased.
Malaysia and the Filipinos are osten-
sibly trying to diminish the smuggling.
“Get rid of the smuggling and there,
will probably be a reversion to piracy,”
commented the Indonesian.
Piracy is by no means the only con-
ceivable “eruption” on the South-East
Asian scene which, to quote Philippines
President Marcos, can take place “with
or without Communist prodding.”
There are the adventurers, the petty
and not-so-petty intriguers, the profes-
sional trouble-makers who can usually
be counted upon to make the general
situation more difficult when it is bad
enough already. As of now the major
threat on this particular score emanates
from Marcos’ own country, in that
Manila retains the Filipino claim to
Sabah.
The Sabah claim has many incredibly
convoluted and intricate sub-plots,
which is scarcely surprising, since the
claim is essentially the product of
Manila politicking, wherein intrigue is
king and the manoeuvring proceeds
often with scant regard for the likely
national or international consequences.
Speaking to the Manila Overseas Press
Club on February 25 President Marcos
portrayed the British withdrawal as
threatening “to widen critically the
security gap in our region” and pledged
the Philippines would “develop closer
relations with our neighbors,” who
“face a common danger,” in the cause
of one day being able to arrange “joint
and effective defence.” It remains true,
however, that the Sabah claim, as it is
still being pursued, does nothing to
narrow “the security gap.” While it
continues to be played the way it is,
closer ASEAN relations will always be
problematical and Malaysian con-
tingency planners will have to consider
to some extent defence against Filipino
intrusions as well as against “the com-
mon danger.”
Unhappily, despite the recent good-
will visit to Manila of Malaysia’s
Deputy Prime Minister, Tun Razak,
and President Marcos’ State visit to
Malaysia, there is every reason why
they should. Kuala Lumpur may be
criticised for being naive in some ways,
but, assuredly, it cannot be so naive or
so ill-informed as not to realise that
one reason the Sabah claim remains
“on the books” is that obviously some
of' the highly placed Filipinos encour-
aging the claim calculate that Sabah
(not to mention Sarawak) will soon
be seceding from Malaysia. The with-
drawal of the British does nothing to
lessen the attractiveness of such a
calculation.
Further, there is the undoubted fact
that one self-styled guerilla “general,”
Abang Kifli (ex-Brunei rebel, ex-
guerilla along the Sarawak-Indonesian
border), was entertained for a month
in Manila recently at the Government-
owned and controlled Manila Veterans’
Memorial Hospital, after having been
invited to the Philippines by the Fili-
pino military attache in Tokyo. Manila
has no doubt offered Kuala Lumpur
numerous explanations why Kifli,
travelling on an Indonesian passport of
some kind, and having just had medical
treatment in Tokyo, needed another
month of it. The hard fact is that in
Manila such explanations are always
likely to leave one wondering is
there more in all this than meets the
eye?
Again unhappily, indeed there is.
For example, highly reliable Tokyo
and other sources insist that while Kifli
was in Japan he was helped by some
Filipino businessmen to buy a consign-
ment of 3000 Armalite rifles.
Three thousand .22 automatic Arma-
lities to guerillarise the Sabah claim?
Maybe. The trouble with the Philip-
pines, consisting as it does of so many
competing power centres, is that one


can never be sure. After all, “Commu-
nist” Huk guerillas in central Luzon
recently used Armalites to shoot up
less well-equipped members of the
Philippines constabulary ... all that
I would assert is that 3000 Armalites
are somewhere in our neighborly
archipelago, making ASEAN together-
ness that much more difficult.
In passing, there is, under the general
heading of “adventurism,” the general
question of “whither Indonesia?”
Leaving aside the not uninteresting
question as to who, precisely, are
Kifli’s friends in Djakarta, the post-
Sukarno era has yet to answer the
question, and thereby raises a doubt.
The Bung dreamed of an Indonesia
unified psychologically and politically
—and centrally controlled to boot. “If
he had achieved this vision what-
ever its effects for my country he
would have been the greatest South-
East Asian bar none,” commented a
leading Malaysian historian.
He didn’t, and while the Western
world generally rejoices over this fact,
it remains to be seen whether his fail-
ure will be more fateful than his suc-
cess. Being themselves uncertain of the
ultimate verdict, Indonesians will not
put the Bung on trial, and they will
eulogise him when he dies.
Presuming the psychological unity
remains, will a high or low degree of
Indonesian political unity be retained?
Will even the sense of pan-Indonesian
identity be retained under the centrifu-
gal pressures of a dormant economy?
Questions such as these obviously have
a critical bearing on the whole ques-
tion of regional security. A meaningful
Indonesia will itself be a triumph of
regional co-operation, leave aside
ASEAN. A “loose” Indonesia will not
only present several conceivable
“threats.” It will also present oppor-
tunities for external influence and inter-
ference which could multiply difficul-
ties. By 1971 it is unlikely that these
underlying questions will have been
resolved. A British withdrawal forces
Malaysia, and particularly Singapore, to
think the harder about coming to terms
with Indonesian reality. The acceler-
ated British withdrawal forces them to
try to do this while the reality is
itself indistinct, before the “New
Order” has shown whether or not it
can resolve old problems.
And there are, of course, the Com-
munists. Will, for a start, the removal
of the British deterrent enhance Chin
Peng’s dreams of taking part in another
Victory Parade? The Malayan Com-
munist Party leader marched past the
Cenotaph in Whitehall in 1946. Now
that his ex-colleagues-in-arms, and
ex-( ?)enemies, are quitting, will his
pulse quicken at the thought of march-
ing past the padang in Kuala Lumpur,
and City Hall steps in Singapore? How
far will the encouragement of the
deterrent’s disappearance entice not
only Chin Peng but the calculations
in distant capitals? The Russians, of
course, have recognised Malaysia. An
ambassador will shortly arrive, pre-
sumably in the expectancy of “revision-
ist” advantages accruing from increased
trade and diplomatic ties.
Conversely, and more relevantly, will
Peking, instead, calculate that the likeli-
hood of instability is such and not
merely because of the British departure
that she will be best advised to hold
to her present, trouble-stirring, revolu-
tion-creating, insurgency-encouraging
course?
The available signs, needless to say,
suggest this latter course. Authorita-
tive sources, noting that the Ho Chi
Minh trail already bends westward into
Thailand as well as eastward into
Vietnam, aware that the consequent
percolation of arms and encourage-
ment extends on down to small guerilla
bands in Thailand’s mid-south, suggest
that soon, maybe already (who
knows?), the trail of incitement directly
reaches Chin Peng on the Malaysia-
Thai border.
It is at this point that the com-
plexity of the jigsaw puzzle really mani-
fests itself. What the Thais do, or do
not do, in the face of their insurgency;
what the Thai National Liberation
Front and its Peking masters do, or
do not do, to get onside with Thai
nationalism”—these are critical factors
in any assessment of regional insecurity.
Crucial, too, is the recent American
pledge to the Thai leaders, given to
Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman
personally, that the U.S. presence would
repiain in Thailand and Vietnam. But
how, in what style, will the Americans
stay? More important still, what
dynamism can the Thais themselves
engender (outside the “developed” area
of Bangkok) at this rather late hour,
in order to prevent their internal in-
securities having profound regional im-
plications?
Assuredly what happens in Thailand
will affect Chin Peng’s calculations,
and everybody else’s. But he will have
to play a very different, separate hand
from the Thai National Liberation
Front if only because he has to get on-
side with Malaysia’s multi-racial
nationalism. The Malayan Communist
Party could, for example, decide to
drop its ostensible “multi-racialism” and
go all out to create communal discord,
hoping that out of strife some oppor-
tunity would emerge. But would it?
No one, least of all any Malay, is
deceived into thinking the MCP repre-
sents anybody else but the Chinese.
However, were the MCP to go all out
to take the Chinese side, it would lose
whatever chance it still has of ever
attaining pan-MaJayan power.
Of course, the tactic might be more
subtle to stir up strife clandestinely
in the hope of driving the Malaysian
Chinese into Communist arms,
which is what the Indonesian Com-
munist Party, the PKI, has in effect
helped do for the Indonesian Chinese.
Still, the problem of multi-racial power
would still haunt the MCP, as it has
always done. But then the Com-
munists (wisely), unlike Westerners, do
not let their thinking stop at national,
ex-colonial borders. Malaysian-Malay
acceptance of Communist rule could
only be brought about via Indonesian
influence. If Chin Peng’s 25-year
sojourn in the jungles is to be worth-
while then he has still to hope for a
resurgence of the PKI.
In any event the Communists also
know that conditions may make for
opportunity, as much as or even more
than they may make an opportunity for
themselves. The fact that British
soldiers may not clamber into VC-10s
and Hercules in Europe at the first
signs of renewed Emergency is one
thing, a spark to interest. But more
important what will be the economic
and communal effects of those troops
being removed to Europe in the first
place?
Once again, questions abound and no
one can be sure of the answers. Will
the Peoples Action Party Government
in Singapore be able to cope with the
rapidly rising unemployment figures
consequent on the base closure? If
not, or in any case, will the situation
be such as to revive the extreme
Chinese Left?
Again, what will be the psychological
impact of the British departure upon
racial harmony within Malaysia? Can
the old balancing factor depart un-
noticed? Is the Alliance Coalition
Government as soundly based as one
hopes so that it can carry on the
balancing alone? Leaving aside .the
not inconsiderable unemployment the
British exit will bestow on Malaysia,
its economy is already badly, though
not disastrously, hurt by the downward
spiral of the price of rubber, and de-
clining prices for tin and palm oil.
Inevitably the city slickers still get
their cut, but rural incomes decline,
and the urban-rural wealth gap grows.
What effect will this have upon com-
munal relations? Despite, and even
because of the Prime Minister Tunku
Abdul Rahman’s statesmanship on the
language question, will the proponents
of a more Malay Malaysia be prodded
on by such economic circumstances?
In short, how difficult will it be for
the Alliance to continue being an effec-
tive alliance? Assuredly the Tunku
well remembers the answer Chin Peng
gave when he came briefly out of the
jungle on the Thai-Malayan border
for peace talks before Malayan in-
dependence. The Tunku prodded the
MCP leader. Since independence was
imminent and for real, why go on
fighting? “To protect the Chinese” was
Chin Peng’s interesting answer. Pro-
vided the Kuala Lumpur Government
retains a substantial grip on Chinese
and Malay loyalties, then Chin Peng
and the MCP can always be check-
mated. But, any way you look at it, in
the immediate future the retaining of
those loyalties is going to be difficult,
and the British departure certainly
makes it no easier.
To be concluded


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A strong economy opens up
unhealthy trade gap
ANY WORRIES about the strength of
the economy should be dispelled by the
latest figures on business capital expen-
diture. For about 18 months these have
been low and have constituted the only
element in total spending which has
been lagging. Consumer spending
started to rise around the middle of last
year. From $407 million in the June
quarter ($5O million below early 1966),
spending on plant and buildings had
risen to $472 million in the December
quarter; the recovery being strongest in
buildings, with plant and equipment
spending still below the early 1966
peak. But buildings generally need
equipment to fill them once they are
finished, so equipment spending can be
expected ta follow the trend. The en-
couraging feature of the rises is that
they are quite broadly based. The
motor industry is about the only one
not included.
Mining investment is up to the huge
level of $93 million, accounting for a
fifth of the total; chemicals spending
has risen well also to $35 million
from $25 million early in the year.
All this has contributed toward the
big rise in imports, which for the first
time in history were approaching the
$3OO-million mark in February. The
previous record high was August last
year, when they pushed $285 million
with exports bouncing around $250 mil-
lion, and an unhealthy trade deficit has
opened up in the first two months of
this year, whereas during most months
of last year imports were roughly bal-
anced by exports.
Retailors
Mason v Catholics
IT WAS BAD enough when Marcus
Clark’s closed down; when Snows
eventually put up its shutters; when
Anthony Horderns’ admitted partial de-
feat at Brickfield Hill; when Morley
Johnsons and Bebarfalds gave up the
fight. Now there is a prospect that Syd-
ney’s most graceful store, Mark Foy’s
patioed palace in Liverpool Street, will
be turned into a “development site” if
the current bid by rival Sydney and
suburban retailer McDowells for
Mark Foy’s succeeds. McDowells have
decided to sell the Piazza store’s
freehold if it gets possession and eventu-
ally to vacate the area still remaining to
retailing.
The McDowells bid for Mark Foy’s,
which is acceptable to directors but not
to one section of the perpetually
warring descendents of its founder, is
aimed more at adding Mark Foys’ nine
suburban and country stores to the Mc-
Dowells chain rather than the Piazza
store, although its sale would help pay
for McDowells’ other plans, like moving
into Grace Bros’, territory at Bondi
Junction. But the bid is also interesting
in bringing together two very different
sorts of retail operations: Mark Foy’s
has always had a strong Catholic clien-
tele and share register; McDowells’
chairman is the former Grand Master
of the United Grand Lodge of N.S.W.
Mining
Tax-man's aid
SOONER OR LATER the Federal
Government will no doubt tighten up
its taxation laws to prevent mining
companies from deducting the cost of
their railways and ports (and other
associated capital items needed to
develop their mines) from their income
for tax purposes. But there is a lot to
be said for leaving the matter right
where Mr. Justice Kitto put it last
week when ruling against the Taxa-
tion Commissioner that expenditure on
those associated activities was “mining
expenditure” for tax purposes.
For anything that improves the
economics of these ventures increases
the likelihood of more of them going
ahead; there may be many that appear
“touch and go” that could become
viable operations given this sort of
assistance —especially since all of them
are in remote areas where the infra-
structure has to be supplied by the
developer. The McArthur River lead-
zinc project of Mt. Isa Mines has
already been mentioned as a more
likely prospect, as has Broken Hill
South’s phosphate project near Clon-
curry.
It is true that one of the major bene-
ficiaries of the judgment (the result
of a claim by BHP) will be the foreign
interests whose role in Australian
mineral development is so large. But
many local companies will also benefit
from the $l5O million in tax deduc-
tions that the Financial Review esti-
mates depended on the outcome of
BHP’s case (and possibly double this
amount within a few years). In par-
ticular, the Mt. Newman project, the
biggest single iron-ore development in
Australia, is likely to get massive tax
savings—and BHP has a 30 percent
interest in it, as has another group
headed by the CSR. The CRA group,
with its Hamersley iron likely to be
able to claim the bulk of the $57 million
cost of its railway line to Mt. Tom
Price and its rolling stock, its $25 mil-
lion port, and at least some of the $l4
million it spent on townships for its
workers, should do very well indeed.
The Savage River iron-ore-pellets
project in Tasmania, headed by Pick-
ands Mather but with several Australian
companies contributing finance, like
Kathleen Investments and Ampol Pet-
roleum, and which was officially opened
last week, had aready been established
on the basis that the 53-mile pipeline
from the mine to the pellet plant at
Port Latta would be deductible as a
mining cost, but its pellet plant clearly
will not be, for Mr. Justice Kitto made
it clear that the deductions were allow-
able on any expenditure that was
needed to bring the ore to a state of
“commercial significance” but not to
upgrade it further.
Savage River’s “deductible” pipeline


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy ? Australia had a trade deficit of
$25.2 million in February, bringing the deficit to $122.1
million for the first eight months of the year, compared with
$30.8 million deficit at the same time last year. Australian
exporters and British and European Shippers agreed to a 6
percent surcharge on freight to Britain from April 1 to cover
the extra cost of re-routing ships via the Cape while the Suez
Canal is closed. The Australian Wheat Board negotiated a
one million ton wheat sale to Communist China, worth at
least $5O million . . . Heavy rain in north and north-west
N.S.W. improved prospects for the next wheat crop.
For the markets: With the U.K. budget less than a
fortnight off, Australian share markets remained cautious,
with golds in demand. But the week ended on a brighter note
for industrials and oils, despite the absence of bullish news
and rumors ... In London and New York interest centred
on the international monetary situation. The pound
sterling was far below official parity of $U.5.2.40. Gold stocks
starred again.
For companies : BHP, with Guest Keen and Nettle-
folds and John Lysaght, will study the feasibility of an inte-
grated iron and steel w’orks, to be jointly owned. Westernport
is the locale favored by observers. BHP won a big tax victory
for mining companies against the Tax Commissioner in the
High Court; chief beneficiaries wall be Mt. Newman (BHP
owms 30 percent) and Hamersley . . . The feasibility of
linking the Hanwright Wittenoom area with the Hamersley
railway is being studied by Hamersley engineers, and a
separate company, Mount Bruce Mining, will be formed,
owmed 75 percent by Hamersley, 25 percent by Hanwright
... in due course the public would be offered 10 percent.
The Japanese-American iron-ore project at Savage River
was officially opened last week . . . and the instigator of that
project, Mr. Roy Hudson, has commissioned a million
feasibility study of a steel industry there.
On the takeover front, CRA increased its Blair Athol bids
. . , American giant TRW Inc. offers $6 million ($1.85 cash
for each $1 share) for Duly and Hansford. McDowells have
offered $4.3 million cash for ailing retailer Mark Foys . . .
whose board approves . . . and Bebarfalds may get a take-
over (from Maples?) . . . Sunkist has agreed in principle to
sell its half interet in the loss-making Sou-West Frozen Food
to British Tobacco.
More interims for the December half rolled in ... In view'
of drought, Elder Smith’s profit was satisfactory, but lower,
but the interim dividend goes up from 4 to 4£ percent . . .
Dalgety and N.Z. Loan’s profit slumped 59 percent to $1
million, insufficient to cover the unchanged 5 percent interim
dividend . . . Good gains in the pastoral division allowed
L. J. Hooker to lift profit 42 percent.
Monier lifted interim dividend from 2 to 3J percent, after
marginal profit increase. Australian Gypsum expects a record
for the full year, if existing conditions in the building
industry are maintained . . . James Wallace profit picked up
despite a 20 percent turnover drop.
Simpson Pope greatly accelerated its earnings recovery, but
higher tax limited the net profit increase to 8.2 percent . . .
Electronic Industries lifted profit 9.2 percent on 8.6 percent
higher turnover, and may increase its annual dividend from
7 percent . . . Clyde had better sales and profits . . . Bidder
for the Australia Hotel, Stocks and Holdings, lifted profit
30 percent . . . International Combustion will hold dividend
rate after a bonus, lifting payout 40 percent.
MEN AND MATTERS
TWELVE YEARS AGO a 29-year-old
engineer hired four men and set up in
business as an air-conditioning con-
tractor in Sydney’s rather faded indus-
trial area, Pyrmont. Now this business,
with its $53,000 net profit a year, fac-
tories at Lidcombe and Wollongong,
land for a prospective plant in Brisbane,
and a distribution centre in Victoria,
is going on the stock exchange.
The company is Dane Industries Pty.
Ltd.; the engineer is 41-year-old Roger
Dane, a specialist in thermodynamics,
who worked his way through the
Sydney Technical College and became
a member of the Institute of Engineers.
He and his brother Frank, an account-
ant who is company secretary, are
launching their company on to the
Sydney Stock Exchange lists through
the skeleton of a failed financier,
Anglo-Pacific Securities Ltd., which has
been three years under the official man-
agement of Sydney accountant Mr.
B. H. Smith.
Although competition has been hot in
air-conditioning (in 1956 there were
four major air-conditioning contractors
in Sydney; now there are 30 or 40
active competitors), Dane has estab-
lished a niche for itself in specialised
refrigeration and air-conditioning equip-
ment, particularly in transport.
The company has installed air-
conditioning throughout the Ansett
Pioneer coach fleet, and has supplied
50 sets of air-conditioning equipment
for the new trains on the Sydney-Perth
run. The transport refrigeration side of
the business, handled by its subsidiary,
McCullagh and Sons (acquired in
1962), provides equipment that traverses
some of the world’s longest and toughest
road routes, from Perth and Carnarvon
to the developing mineral and oil fields
and the space-tracking stations of north-
west W.A. The Victorian subsidiary,
Strataflo Victoria Pty., is Australian
distributor for the Trane Co. of
America, which monopolised the trans-
port air-conditioning field in U.S.A.,
and is one of the world’s largest manu-
facturers of air-conditioning equipment.
WEDGWOODS HAVE BEEN
making some of the world’s best china
for more than two hundred years. But
not before Mr. Arthur Bryan came
along has anybody outside the family
circle been head of the business
(although there is a young Wedgwood
in the firm’s European office) nor,
until last year when it floated on the
London Stock Exchange, has the public
ever had a stake in it. It is on the
cards that Mr. Bryan’s present visit
will not be his last, because the firm
is now seeking to expand its already
considerable share of the Australian
pottery market.
Mr. Bryan doesn’t look at all like a
china-man, and when he started out
Arthur Bryan
Roger Dane
in life 45 years ago and went through
a high school in England his parents
were hardly thinking of the pos-
sibility. He was put in Barclays Bank.
The war changed all that. After serv-
ing with bombers in the RAF
(still only 24), the world of pottery
called him. He put two years of in-
tensive study of the subject under his
belt at Wedgwood and, starting as a
salesman in the business, was soon
climbing rapidly through the branches
of the family tree. Within three years
he was assistant London manager and
in another ten president of Josiah
Wedgwood and Sons Inc. of America,
putting a third on the sales in that
lucrative market. His ascent in the
firm and the industry continued until
early this year he was made chairman
of the public company in the U.K.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Federal-State
finance and
the "power game"
BY J. C. HORSFALL
LET ITSl T S BEGIN at the beginning. Sir
Henry Bolte has been just as alive to
the open go in getting special grants
from the Commonwealth in the past
two years as any other Premier, pos-
sibly more so. At any rate, he has
received his fair share of them. More
important in his view, however, he has
pressed as hard, if not harder, than
any of the Premiers for more liberal
treatment in tax reimbursements, work-
ing on the solid ground of Victoria’s
high (on a per capita basis) contribu-
tion to Commonwealth revenue col-
lections from the uniform taxation net-
work. He has had but little success in
stepping up Victoria’s proportion of
total tax reimbursements, but at the
same time his total take has risen ap-
preciably. What success he has had
has been largely at the expense of the
Federal purse. This is because the tax
reimbursement formula applying to all
States has itself had to be liberalised
for him to achieve it.
Despairing of further liberalisation
of the formula and seemingly invited
by the Federal Treasurer last year to
raise more revenue within the State,
Sir Henry took the plunge. He came
up with his novel all-purpose tax device,
what in effect is a combination of an
income tax, a transactions tax, and a
sales tax. He gave it the innocent-
looking title of a stamp duty fair
enough, I suppose, because stamps have
to be bought from the Victorian Gov-
ernment to pay it, which nicely obviates
any problems, say, of persuading the
Federal Treasury to collect it.
It was obvious all along that, what-
ever else Victoria’s new stamp duty
might be, in so far as it is levied on
wages and salaries it is an income tax.
This is probably clearest to those who
for the past month or so have been
lining up for their wages each week
and fishing the tax from their pockets
as a necessary prelude to getting their
pay packets. There was never any ques-
tion of the Commonwealth Treasury
condoning a rival income tax to its own
uniform one. All Mr. Gorton did last
week was to point the obvious to Sir
Henry Bolte and suggest he remove the
tax from wages and salaries or take the
consequences in a lower tax reimburse-
ment. The expected had happened. But
Sir Henry is no fool. For him it was
not so much a “try on” as a political
tactic. He could just as easily have left
wages and salaries out of it, thus making
it a transactions tax pure and simple.
In that case, by stepping the rate up
a bit, the sacrifice to net revenue could
easily have been minimised. Even if a
transactions tax is as near to being
a company tax (also a Federal pre-
serve) that the difference doesn’t
matter, the Commonwealth must surely
have turned its blind eye just as it
would have to a less subtly disguised
sales tax.
Whether Sir Henry now removes
wages and salaries from the impost de-
pends more on his political than on his
tax assessment, whether it suits the pur-
poses of a strategy designed to get a new
financial deal for the States (parti-
cularly his State) from the Common-
wealth. From Mr. Gorton’s delaying
tactics in putting off the evil day of
facing up to Sir Henry and the other
Premiers across a Canberra table it
would appear that the new PM is quite
happy to let Sir Henry go on making
the running (. . . and the mistakes) be-
fore coming to real grips with a prob-
lem for which a solution is as “urgent”
as ever, albeit “urgent” being a highly
relative word in this context.
So far the Commonwealth, and
especially Mr. Gorton, is concerned
that the longer the full exercise can be
postponed the better. The method
adopted by the Holt-McMahon teams
was to appease the Premiers by putting
salve on their financial wounds, an
extra hand-out here, another there, and
as often as not applied with the softest
of barely disguised political touches to
put electorates in a better mood. The
most blatant applications of this sort
by Mr. Holt were on the eve of the
last Senate election when Mr. Brand
(the W.A. Premier), in Canberra for
some unrelated business, had a huge
sum for the Ord tossed his way out of
the blue (not that it availed the Gov-
ernment much, if anything, in that elec-
tion). Anyway, the Holt-McMahon
approach to the needs of the States was
to appease them at every turn (private
talks and Premiers’ Conferences alike)
without all that much thought for Fed-
eral financial consequences or for those
of the country as a whole (the private
sector also came in for some belated
recognition last Budget, but now Mr.
Bury, at least, appears to have grave
doubts on that score).
In this “power game” you don’t
necessarily have to get private secre-
taries of Ministers and civil servants on
your side (in bed, anyway). All you
need is an election coming up, an un-
favorable Gallup Poll on your recent
record, a bad Press, or, say, an obvious
outsize gap in your development or
immigrant assimilation defences. This is
probably putting it a bit strongly, but
obviously in these modern times, public-
works nepotism is as rampant as in the
bad old days, of which there are plenty
of examples in Michael Cannon’s “The
Land Boomers” and elsewhere. It cer-
tainly pays a Federal Government to
keep as many aces up its sleeve as it can
for ad hoc disbursements to the States.
And even with Governments as liberal
with their money as the Holt one, it
pays to keep tax reimbursement
formulae as niggardly as possible. This
is not to say, of course, anything but
instinct for political survival is behind
the Federal-State power game, or that
even if tax reimbursement and capital
allocation formulae could be perfected
to the satisfaction of State and Federal
Governments alike the play would stop.
Nor is it at all certain that with Mr.
Gorton in the saddle the sloppy state of
Federal-State financial arrangements
(as indeed that of officially inspired
credit liberality in the private sector)
under the former Federal administra-
tion is going to persist. Perhaps we
would be a little more sure that it won’t
had the new PM not chosen to disown
Mr. Bury’s diagnosis of the resources-
allocation position last week. It would
appear from this that, contrary to an
earlier impression, Gorton hasn’t yet got
the order of essential national priorities
right. It could be that, like his pre-
decessor, too much rope will be given
to the States relentlessly to pursue their
financial designs to the detriment of the
essential number one priority of de-
fence; and rather than saying to the
States at the forthcoming Premiers’
Conference that they must cut their
coats to the limited cloth he will leave
the line slack, the door open, and so en-
courage them to pursue inflated spend-
ing courses in the hope that when the
time comes to pay the bills the Federal
Government will come to the party.
The most tantalising aspect of this
game is that in a rapidly developing
economy (especially one -also essaying a
vigorous defence build-up) the escalator
is moving up faster all the time. This
is not only because the x'ival claims on
resources are demanding a bigger phys-
ical share but also because, with the
pressures on resources so tight, price in-
creases have to be accommodated in
any figures for allocation of finance. So
far as allocations to the States go it is
not easy to do the sums right under
these conditions (we expect Treasury
officials to do them correctly all the
same). Difficult or not, in doing their
allocation sums in the recent past the
officials appear to have erred on the
side of butter rather than guns (always
leaving the Treasury with something in
hand for the ad hoc hand-out occa-
sions) and now it would seem impera-
tive to swing the other way even if this
means the States’ getting far less than
their expectations.
Taxable capacity being limited over
the whole Commonwealth and in each
individual State, the moral to be drawn
by Sir Henry and Mr. Brand (who
seems equally as keen as him to get Mr.
Gorton to the conference table) is
pretty obvious.

Supplementary
Report
EXCERPTS FROM
DIRECTORS'
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT,
FEBRUARY, 1968
GROUP REVIEW
For ' the six months ended 30th
November, 1967, steel ingot production
was 3.13 million tons and pig-iron
output 2.52 million tons. The steel
ingot figure represents a 3.0% increase
on the corresponding six months of
the previous year, with pig-iron show-
ing an increase of 2.6%.
DOMESTIC AND
OVERSEAS
TRADING
For the half year Australian sales
recorded a worthwhile increase over
the corresponding period in 1966.
Although affected by increased costs,
trading profit for the half year was
also somewhat higher. There was a
slight decline in demand for some
finished product categories, but this
was compensated by increased deli-
veries of semi-finished products to
associated companies, particularly
during the early part of the period.
Overall domestic demand, as shown by
order bookings, maintained the high
level of the preceding half year and
in consequence less export sales were
booked. Since the end of the half year
orders in Australia and New Zealand
for merchant bars, tinplate, wire pro-
ducts, and for semi-finished steel for
associated companies have declined
noticeably. A combination of factors,
including the effects of drought in
south-eastern Australia, the devaluation
of Sterling, and the weak economic
situation in New Zealand is respon-
sible for this decline. On the other
hand, steel requirements for major
developmental projects are expected to
sustain satisfactory demand for struc-
tural sections and plates.
The reduction in some sections of
Australian demand has caused us to
intensify our export activities. Un-
fortunately, owing to low prices
obtainable, in export markets, many
of these sales will contribute only
marginally to profits.
OIL AND GAS
DEVELOPMENTS
The installation of facilities connected
with the development of the Barra-
couta and Marlin fields is proceeding
rapidly, and in general the construc-
tion programme is proceeding to
schedule.
Although delayed by adverse offshore
weather conditions during January the
offshore Barracouta A platform is
nearing completion and drilling of pro-
duction wells will commence shortly.
The onshore phase of the larger
Marlin A platform fabrication has been
completed at the Barry Beach marine
terminal and the platform will be
placed in position as soon as the
Barracouta platform is completed.
Pipes for the offshore pipelines are
being weight coated at the Barry Beach
terminal, and pipelaying is scheduled
to commence upon completion of the
Marlin platform.
Site preparation is nearing completion
at the Gippsland gas processing plant
and at the Long Island Point
fractionation plant sites, and the main
construction activities are about to
commence. Onshore pipeline routes
have been established and contracts
have been let for pipelaying. An agree-
ment has been completed with the
State of Victoria for the construction
of a loading jetty, and construction
work has commenced.
Development of the Halibut and King-
fish fields has been the subject of
detailed investigation over the past few
months, and preliminary work, includ-
ing fabrication of platforms at the
Barry Beach marine terminal, has
commenced. Hematite Petroleum has
exercised its right under the agreement
with Esso to take a 50% working
interest in these fields.
Prior to the completion of the King-
fish B-l well, plans for development
of these fields had been based on a
possible crude oil production rate of
up to 135,000 barrels per day by the
end of 1970. However, interpretation
of recent results is likely to require
revision of these estimates. It is still
the position that estimates of potential
production are based on interpretation
of limited data and may be subject to
revision from time to time as further
data becomes available.
Marketing of natural gas and other
products is receiving close attention,
and in addition to the sale of natural
gas to Victorian distributors, other
markets are being investigated, both
within Victoria and interstate. A
company to be jointly owned by Hema-
tite Petroleum and Esso is being
formed to market natural gas to
industries located outside the areas at
present served by existing gas distri-
bution companies. In the interstate
field a second jointly owned company
is being formed to conduct investiga-
tions into all aspects of pipeline
transmission and this company could
own and operate transmission pipelines
to transport natural gas to distant
markets.
MT. NEWMAN
It will be recalled that we have a
30% interest, through our subsidiary,
Dampier Mining Co. Ltd., in the Mt.
Newman iron-ore project. Mt. Newman
Mining Co. Pty. Ltd. is undertakings
on behalf of the consortium, the man-
agement of the venture. During the
first five years, which will cover the
construction and initial operation
phase, Mt. Newman Mining Co. will
remain a wholly owned subsidiary of
our Company.
Contracts have been signed for all
major items of equipment and the
construction programme is on schedule.
At the mine site, quarry development
is proceeding as is the construction
of mine facilities and the mine town-
ship. Dredging and filling at Port
Hedland is also proceeding, with half
the fill necessary for developments at
the port having been placed. Railroad
materials and rolling stock are being
progressively delivered to the site and
the laying of the 265-mile-long track
will commence this month.
RAW MATERIALS
AND EXPLORATION
A contract by the Company to supply
iron-ore pellets to Japanese steel mills
was signed in October and this pro-
vides for total shipments from
Whyalla of 9.9 million tons over eight
years, commencing October, 1968. At
Koolyanobbing all facilities are opera-
ting satisfactorily and ironstone is being
railed to Kwinana over the new
standard gauge railway and is being
shipped to both the Newcastle and
Port Kembla works.

Additional plant and equipment is
being installed at Groote Eylandt to
raise production levels by mid-1968.
Present shipments of manganese ore
are almost equally divided between
Bell Bay requirements and overseas
markets, including Japan, U.S.A., and
Europe.
Assessment of nickel prospects held by
the Company near Rockhampton,
Queensland, was continued by Inter-
national Nickel Southern Exploration
Ltd., a subsidiary of The International
Nickel Co. of Canada Ltd. Explora-
tion drilling will be completed in 1968.
Substantial quantities of nickel laterites
have been disclosed but they are low
grade and the possibility of economic
development is under careful investiga-
tion. At this stage it would be
premature to form any judgment.
Exploration for nickel also continues
on the Company’s tenements at Mount
Monger in Western Australia, but no
economic mineralisation has been dis-
covered. The Company and Inter-
national Nickel have joint interest in
these areas and also in other areas
held by International Nickel in the
Kalgoorlie area.
In the area of the Company’s coal
prospecting rights near Blackwater,
Queensland, drilling and testing of
coal samples continued and results
indicate substantial reserves of good
quality coking coal.
Sampling of bauxite deposits near
Kalumburu Mission in the Northern
Kimberleys has commenced and
exploration continues in parts of
Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, as
well as in Cape Range, Western Aus-
tralia, and in south-west Tasmania.
SUBSIDIARY
COMPANIES
Commonwealth Steel Co. Ltd. opera-
tions showed considerable improvement
over the unsatisfactory 1966 period with
sales of bars and blooms from the
Waratah (Newcastle) plant and stain-
less-steel flat products from Unanderra
(Wollongong) making the main con-
tributions to increased turnover during
the period.
As recently announced, plans are now
being studied to provide for the instal-
lation of a new 62in.-wide Sendzimir
mill and other processing equipment
at Unanderra that will enable the
present capacity to produce cold rolled
stainless-steel sheet and coiled strip to
be more than doubled by mid-1970.
Demand for products of the Australian
Wire Industries Pty. Ltd. group of
companies has been depressed com-
pared to corresponding 1966 levels.
Drought conditions affected the major
domestic markets, and we have not
been able to offset this reduction in
demand by export sales.
At Rylands Bros., Newcastle, the pro-
duction of high-tensile barbed wire has
been doubled but this has mainly
resulted from a decline in the usage
of the traditional heavy gauge lOWA
barb. A new twelve wire plant for
production of bronze-plated tyre bead
wire was commissioned. Early in 1968
another ten strands will be added to
the rod patenting line and a new
shaping and rolling plant capable of
producing 10,000 tons per year has
been authorised.
Installation of three new machines at
The Australian Wire Rope Works has
increased the range of and production
capacity for dragline and conveyor belt
ropes for the mining industry.
Southern Portland Cement Limited
achieved record sales during the period.
Work on mechanisation of operations
at Medway colliery and the installa-
tion of a calcimatic kiln at the Marulan
limestone quarry proceeded toward
planned commissioning during the first
half of 1968.
Operations and financial results at the
Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co.
Pty. Ltd. plant at Bell Bay have been
adversely affected by serious power
cuts imposed in that State, and it was
necessary to close down No. 1 ferro
manganese furnace early in 1968 for
it's first reline since 1962. Production
of ferro manganese at this centre using
Groote Eylandt manganese ore has
continued with satisfactory results. The
favorable market trends noted for The
Titan Manufacturing Co. Pty. Ltd. in
the last Annual Report have been
maintained.
RESEARCH
The Central Research Laboratories
at Shortland are contributing usefully
to our exploration and mineral
development work as well as to our
iron and steelmaking activities.
Construction is well advanced on the
Melbourne research laboratories and
the technological building will be ready
for occupation in July. The main
laboratory building will be completed
in October. These laboratories will con-
centrate on research into improvement
of existing Company products and on
the development of new products.
SHIPPING
The Company’s fleet of 16 vessels has
continued to operate during the period.
Company vessels were used to a lesser
extent in the coastal movement of raw
materials and products, as special sur-
veys were carried out for two Yampi
class vessels and the “Iron Whyalla.”
In the course of this work the carry-
ing capacity of “Iron Whyalla” was
increased from 10,000 tons to 12,000
tons and all three vessels were con-
verted to oil firing. Similar modification
to “Iron Spencer” currently being
undertaken will complete the con-
version of our fleet from coal to oil
firing.
Exports by the Group of products and
raw materials continued at a high level
and totalled 565,000 tons for the six
months to November. The proportion
sold on a CIF basis comprised 380,000
tons, shipment being undertaken in 11
voyages by Australian flag vessels, 14
voyages in foreign chartered vessels,
and in liner tonnage as required.
Buyers arranged freight for the balance,
mainly bulk cargoes of ironstone, man-
ganese ore, coke breeze, and salt sold
on an F. 0.8 basis. Additionally, “Iron
Cavalier” carried three shipments of
coal totalling 103,000 tons to Japan
for outside interests.
The first shipment of Koolyanobbing
ironstone was loaded in “Iron Derby”
in August at our new bulk handling
jetty at Kwinana. Delivery of steel
products, sleepers, and general cargo
to Port Hedland for the Mt. Newman
project has involved the continuous
use of three company vessels since June,
to which a fourth, under time charter,
was added in August.
Negotiations have been completed for
the long-term chartering of a 68,000-
ton deadweight vessel to be built in
England for commissioning in Febru-
ary, 1969. This vessel will be employed
in conjunction with “Iron Hunter”
now under construction at Whyalla
shipyard, to carry that portion of the
Japanese pellet contract for which the
Company has to arrange the shipping.
EMPLOYMENT
The general shortage of skilled trades-
men throughout Australia continues to-
affect us, more particularly at Port
Kembla and Whyalla. In addition,
general labor is required at Kwinana
where commissioning of plants this-
year will require a substantial increase
in the work-force. Accommodation is-
proving a limiting factor at Kwinana
and is also affecting recruitment for
Whyalla works.
Continued attention is being given to
staff planning and development. The
Company’s training activities are being
maintained at a high level and there
are currently 4557 young people under
the training scheme. Late in 1967 a
personnel exchange scheme was-
arranged with Fuji Iron and Steel Co.,
Japan, and two Company officers are
now in Japan whilst two younig
Japanese graduates are gaining experi-
ence within our group.
Most of our plants experienced some
industrial disputes during the past six
months and whilst there were no work
stoppages of long duration, some loss-
of output resulted. Once again our
shipping and, apart from at Whyalla,
our stevedoring operations have been
free from industrial dislocation.
SAFETY
We continued our efforts to improve
safe working practices and there has
been a general improvement through-
out the organisation in safety perform-
ance with the main steelwork centres
of Newcastle and Port Kembla
achieving record low frequency rates
of 2.5 and 2.2 lost N time injuries per
million man hours worked respectively.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Taking a chance
on the future
of outer space
ONE OF THE MERCHANT banks
around town puts out a monthly pam-
phlet on the state of the economy. Last
month’s was rather interesting. It had
a summary of the price performances
of 75 major listed companies since
1939. The companies were broken into
industry groups and adjustments were
made for capital changes. Some of the
results were eye openers. Here they are:
1. The pastoral and finance group of
companies (don’t ask me why these
two were lumped together) are still at
less than double their price of nearly 30
years ago. They are below the price of
ten years ago.
2. The retail companies are just
barely double their price of 30 years
ago and are now only about level with
their price of ten years ago.
3. The manufacturing and distribut-
ing companies are more heartening.
They are now around 3.5 times their
price of 30 years ago; and are up 66
percent on prices of a decade ago.
4. The insurance companies are even
better. Their prices have doubled in
value over the last decade and are
currently 5.5 times larger than they
were three decades ago.
5. Taking all 75 companies in the
exercise together, prices are now 3.3
times higher than 30 years ago and 1.3
times better than those of ten years
ago.
The whole thing is really a good case
for trading as compared to team invest-
ing so trading we will go.
Although I feel the mining market
is now going through a ticklish stage
and that the sensible thing to do is
just sit on the fence until some sort
of definite pattern is re-established, I’m
going to take a chance and buy in.
The company I’m buying into is not at
all chancy, but there is a risk its price
could drop a few more points, if the
rest of the mining market continues to
decline. However, whatever happens I
still think I’m getting a bargain at to-
day’s price and that sometime within
the next six months I’ll be ahead on
the deal.
The company is Western Titanium.
It mines ilmenite in Western Australia
and has done very well. It now looks
like doing very much better. The reasons
are twofold. Firstly is the fact that it’s
selling a product which is very much in
demand. World demand for titanium
dioxide (derived from ilmenite and also
rutile) is up and away and suppliers are
having trouble (admittedly the sort of
trouble they like) keeping up the pace.
Titanium metal is in unceasing demand
for supersonic jets, spacecraft, and
other outer-space-type gear. It is also
wanted for much more down-to-earth
uses such as non-corrosive pipelines for
salt water. It is also used in submar-
ines. The pigments industry wants it.
And the London Metal Bulletin’s asso-
ciate, Industrial Metal, has estimated
that by the mid 1970 s the world’s pig-
ment industry will be using three mil-
lion tons a year of the stuff, which is a
lot of ilmenite in anyone’s language.
Another reason for liking Western
Titanium is its plan (w'hich soon looks
like being a reality) to beneficiate the
titanium dioxide content of ilmenite.
The company has already commis-
sioned a semi-commercial plant with
an annual output of 10,000 tons that
will upgrade the titanium dioxide con-
tent of ilmenite from around 55 per-
cent to somewhat closer to 93 percent.
If the operation proves to be a success,,
and initial reactions to the samples so-
far produced have been favorable, a
plant with an annual capacity of
100,000 tons will follow. If this turns
out to be the case, then Western Tit-
anium will have it made. If it doesn’t
the company is still doing pretty well
as it is. Either way the contributing
shares look good value at $2.50. I
bought 500.
No sales again this week. March is.
a time to be loading up rather than
selling off.

Retailers weather wage rises
By JASON
THERE ARE TWO schools of thought
about the merits of retailers in a time
of wage rises. One says that higher
wages bring big increases in retail sales
and therefore profits; the other that
retailers’ costs rise disastrously in a bout
of wage increases because they employ
so many people in relation to their pro-
fits. In general, these two factors prob-
ably cancel themselves out; the best
stimulus to retail spending seems to
come ■ not from general wage rises but
from increased overtime, anyway. And
at the moment there seem only moder-
ate levels of overtime being worked. So
the excellent results from Waltons and
Grace Brothers in recent weeks are
likely to be even further improved if
the level of economic activity in Aus-
tralia rises ahead of the rate of addi-
tions to the workforce. And the indi-
cations are that in coming years, once
the balance-of-payments deficit has been
catered for by our mineral exports, this
will be so. We recommended Grace
Bros.' last year at $1.60; this month’s
news of “substantial increase in profits
and sales” and the promise of further
development to come has lifted them to
$2.30. Like Myers, they now look ex-
pensive. But like Myers, they also seem
to have an excellent future,
Waltons still languishes unloved at
85 cents, even though its big profit rise
for the half year has brought pre-tax
profits to $3.1 million, the best ever, and
$200,000 more than the pre-tax profit
for the January, 1966, half year, when
Waltons owned all of the highly profit-
able FNCB-Waltons finance associate,
which now provides only half its net
profit of $486,000 (or $243,000) to
Waltons. This is a stock that has its
risky elements, like any that deals so
heavily in instalment credit.
NOW THAT British Tobacco is to con-
solidate Sou-West Frozen Foods
Packers into its accounts, following last
week’s settlement of its legal problems,
the outlook for British Tobacco shares
this year has become a bit brighter.
There will still be a lot of problems;
the Victorian drought’s decimation of
the pea crop will add to the general
difficulties the company has been hav-
ing in its food divisions. And the
absorption of Sou-West will mean
that the group’s consolidated reserves
will suffer a reduction of about $BOO,OOO
because of its accumulated losses on top
of the $300,000 provision against loss
already made out of British Tobacco’s
profits in 1967.
IS THE OFFER OF $1.85 a share
enough for Duly and Hansford? This
Sydney motor - parts maker, which
stands to benefit from any increase in
new model Holden sales and which has
been recommended here not so long ago
at prices below its $1 par value, seems
to be worth a lot more to a foreign bid-
der trying to get into this expanding
market than the offer price that has
come so far from TRW, the big U.S.
valve maker under whose licence Duly’s
make engine valves here. For there is
another U.S. valve maker (also, like
Dufor, in the axles business) which may
find it worth while to beat TRW to the
prize—at this price. It is Eaton Valves,
TRW’s rival at home, which has re-
cently been taking an interest in devel-
oping things here. With the families
of the company’s founders, Duly and
Hansford, still large shareholders, it
seems likely that a bid as low as $1.85
has little chance of success. But a better
one is not out of the question.
AMPOL PETROLEUM is much more
of an oil-producing stock and there-
fore a better buy than the market
thinks. When takeover talk was in the
air, and the market was bouncing along
at the top, shares in Ampol were up
as high as $1.33; last week they had
dropped back to little better than a
dollar. But the implications of state-
ments at the recent annual meeting
about water injecting at Wapet’s Bar-
row Island wells, the evidence that
Pascoe Island could be another signifi-
cant field, and the improvement in the
profitability of petrol retailing
(evidenced by H. C. Sleigh’s bright
news) all mean that investors will be
getting much more than a dollar’s worth
from this stock sooner or later.
The most significant factor is clearly
the use of water-injecting techniques
in the Barrow Island field. These could
well up-grade the field from the 114
million barrels estimated as recoverable
by primary methods to somewhere
round the 300-million-barrel mark.
There are already two water-injection
wells down, and there will be 25-30
going down this year. The company is
not saying exactly by how much it
expects this technique to upgrade the
The Chartist says:
GREENBUSHES TIN N.L. is an outstanding recovery prospect on technical
grounds. After a general sideways movement from 1964-66, which took the form of
a descending triangle, a downward trend finally took prices to a low point of 13c
late 1967. A head-and-shoulders base reversal pattern has since taken prices to a
high of 29c recently on extremely high volume. Targets of close to 40c, 50c, and
64c lie ahead with the potential of a move to $1.20 for the longer term. Last sale
price on 7/3/68 —23 c.

and proud of it!
“Surprising,” you might say, “where could you put the axle?” Not so
surprising, however, when you realise that we’re talking about a rotating
fender using several Olympic heavy-duty tyres to form a king-size cushion
to keep the overhanging deck of the container ship “Kooringa” from
bumping against the wharf at the Port of Melbourne’s Victoria Dock. Rather
a change for Olympic tyres and quite unlike thousands on cars and trucks
running safely along every highway in Australia.
Olympic have the answers to many problems not only in tyres and tyre
care, but in the fields of telecommunication and transmission cables, bulk
materials handling by conveyor belting, or industrial plastics for many
engineering uses.
In so many ways, Australian-made Olympic products provide the answer for
problems and everyday needs, large or small, domestic or industrial. Just
ask us about yours. If it’s branded “Olympic” it’s the best.

One reason why Jack Alvey is a success-
ful exporter is that he goes out of his way
to demonstrate the advantages of his
product - overseas.
He’s manager of Charles Alvey & Son
Pty. Ltd; their famous product is the
Alvey side cast fishing reel. Regularly
Jack Alvey flics overseas, and takes
agents and buyers fishing. There, he can
convincingly demonstrate the advantages
of his fishing reel.
Result is, his English and American agents
are genuine Alvey reel fans - and now
they’re having trouble meeting demand!
The moral is: If you’ve got a good
product, it should sell anywhere in the
world. Just go out and sell it! Appoint
an agent. Take the trouble to show it,
explain it, demonstrate it. Keep it up.
The first bite could mean a big order.
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal fluctuations:
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.

reserves, but Wapet, in which Ampol
Expl. has a 1 -7th interest, would not
have gone into water injection unless it
had expected a considerable increase
in the recoverable reserves.
Wapet will be in a better position to
know the extent of the upgrading in
1969. Apart from increasing the re-
coverable reserves in a field (in the
U.S. it has lifted recovery to 90 per-
cent in some reservoirs), water injecting
also maintains production when, as is
natural, it is inclined to slow down after
a while.
The tests on nearby Pascoe Island
have resulted in a mixed bag, but the
implications of the number one well
are most impressive. It flowed oil at
an equivalent rate of 625 and 415
barrels a day from two horizons (which
compared with a Barrow Island average
of 115 barrels a day per well). These
tests, made through a Jin. surface
choke, make the area very attractive
indeed, despite the fact that Pascoe
number two well was dry and that
number three flowed at the far lower
rate of 91 barrels a day. Ampol looks
a good oil stock, it clearly has more
good news to come.
The Melbourne market
Some shots in the
arm for ACI
AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED
INDUSTRIES, our fourth - biggest
industrial concern, hasn’t been all that
forthcoming with information about its
doings up to now, but it seems Sir
James Forrest, its chairman, has had
a change of heart since the New Year
Honors. Even so, last week at the
company’s first Press conference one
can remember in Melbourne, when its
technical assistance agreement with the
world’s biggest glass-maker, Owens-
Illinois of the U.S., was announced,
the one thing we couldn’t squeeze out
of anyone was how much it was going
to cost. As a general rule, when
Owens agrees to let foreign companies
in on its technical secrets, it insists on
getting .a share in their equity. This
time, with ACI more determined than
a lot of other Australian concerns not
to let Americans inside their gates, it
has agreed simply to take some hard
cash. ACl’s men are already on the
way to the States to get their money’s
worth. This is expected to be realised
more in the form of production tech-
niques calculated to reduce costs, say
in prolonging the life of glass-making
furnaces (ACI now has to rebuild its
furnaces about every five years) than
in new products, though it hopes to
benefit in that way also.
The agreement, which is for five
years from this month, should give a
shot in the arm to ACl’s already con-
siderable research efforts at home,
where it has laboratories in all its
factories supported by the ACI tech-
nical centre at Waterloo (N.S.W.).
This isn’t necessarily to say that ACI
has run out of ideas for winning the
battle between the various packaging
materials. It is more that the com-
pany has recently become a lot more
outward-looking. Another sign of this
is that, like BHP and McPhersons, it
has embraced the American idea of
profit centres. The management seems
very confident that within five years
the company will hardly know itself
and the world outside will know it a
good deal better. Apparently the
object lesson comes from the new look
given to its biggest customer in Mel-
bourne by Mr. Brian Breheny, the
general manager of Carlton and United
Breweries.
SHAVING A CENT or two from the
return on Treasury notes hasn’t con-
vinced anyone that interest rates are
going into reverse. Nor has it had any
effect on bank shares, which have been
pretty sick since the higher rates for the
three-year bonds in the February loan
were announced. The index has come
back a full ten points since it momen-
tarily touched its all time high of 150
on January 23. All bank shares have
dropped, particularly The Wales and
the CBA, the latter more proportion-
ately than the rest, being down from its
year’s high of $2.97 to $2.62 after being
$2.50 recently.
The market appears to have treated
the CBA most unkindly, because the
bank seems to come out well on the
score of earnings from its one-for-three
bid for its finance company affiliate,
General Credits, in which it already
held 43 percent of the shares, though
outside holders of General Credits’
shares would seem to agree with it be-

CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

case isn’t very encouraging for those
who’ve been canvassing the possibilities
of other banks bidding for their finance
company affiliates. If the CBA had
offered cash instead of a share, the
market story might have been quite
different.
GIBSON KELITE is fairly young so
far as listed companies go, the float
taking place in the 1960-61 boom.
Being a solidly based concern under
excellent management it belied the
Cassandras by keeping its head high
and profits up in the recessed business
conditions that hit the economy in the
year following the float, and in only
one year since—that is, in 1965-66
have profits dipped. Even in that year
the 10 percent dividend was paid under
an earnings umbrella of 16.6 percent
despite unprofitable trading in the
Osco domestic and industrial hot water
services subsidiary, which has since been
sold off on to Malleys (domestic side)
and Thermal Equipment (industrial
section) albeit at the incurrence of a
$38,000 capital loss.
Having cleared the profit decks of
the unprofitable Osco obstacle, the
group has since been sailing full steam
ahead: a half-term report which raises
the dividend from 5 to 6 percent for
the half-year (a 7-|- percent final was
paid last year making 12-|- percent in
all) and announces the restoration of
the earnings rate on higher capital to
provide double cover for the announced
interim indicates that progress is con-
tinuing. It may be a moot point
whether the final dividend will also be
increased and it is better to assume,
for the time being at any rate, a 131-
percent total for the year. Also, even
if profits continue to rise at the same
pace as in the first half of the year
the cover for such a payment might
still be a shade under the notional
twice times indicated by the first-half’s
profit.
Being well in line to benefit from
the expanding market for chemicals
and also from the heightened level of
building, particularly housing, this
year Gibson Kelite could easily improve
on these assumptions when it reports
for the full year. At least the interim
is most confident, with sales continuing
their improvement up to February and
indicating that there are still $40,000
tax losses from former unprofitable
acquisitions to help the tax provision.
All in all, the 50-cent shares look pretty
good at a cent or two over the dollar,
the latest buyer offering $1.05, at which,
assuming a 13£ percent total for the
year, the yield is around a useful 6.3
percent. It is well worth thinking
about.
To an outside observer there’s a
mixed-up-kid look about Noske Indus-
tries what with its mix of flour, motor,
and other vehicles selling, stock feed,
and engineering interests, but presum-
ably it all makes sense to Mr. T. I. W.

Kelly, the main mixer, and share-
holders will note that even if he hasn’t
been able to give them a higher interim
than the 4 percent paid last time
(annual rate 8 percent) he has pulled
some very attractive profit figures from
the pot for the latest half-year (to
December last). These show a precise
30 percent improvement on the like
period of last year in net profit and
a bit more if some useful capital profits
are weighed in. Assuming which
looks reasonable on the report’s prog-
nostications that a percentage in-
crease of this order could ensue for
the full year, earning would show
something like a three times cover for
an 8 percent dividend. At any rate
at least a 2£ times cover might be
safely assumed compared with last
year’s 1.9 times.
It seems to have escaped a lot of
people’s notice that the 50-cent shares
have been resting without hardly mov-
ing their elbow above par all this year
(the last sale at this point of time is
50 and the lowest this year 49). On
an 8 percent dividend basis you don’t
have to be a Cambridge wrangler to
work out the dividend or earnings
yields or to be able to hypothecate
what they would be for a purchase of
the shares at this price given a lift in
the dividend and earnings rates for
the full year. Of course, with a lot
of the business in rural areas it is
possible to be nervous at the outcome
for the company of restricted spending
there and, equally, the second-hand
market in vehicles has been in the
doldrums, as Mr. Kelly shows himself
depressingly aware, quite apart from
the writing-down of used-car stocks
(once again), in his interim report. But
while the Queens Bridge Motors part of
the mix looks as if it could be usefully
removed from the pot altogether
its small profit was further reduced in
the latest six months it should soon
benefit from the new-model Holden.
Most of the profits come from the
flour and feed interests and these look
on the up and up despite the reduced
wheat harvest this year. As for stock
feed, the group’s new plant and ancil-
lary silos at Horsham are now in
operation (capital expenditure on them
has been helping the net profit figure
already, through the useful channel of
tax allowances) and will help to boost
earnings. Unfortunately the shares
have an unenviable reputation in the
market despite the fact that millers
generally are fairly well regarded. The
highest they reached last year was 69
cents and they didn’t go below 48
cents. The year before, they were up
to 79 cents. Oddly enough the divi-
dend record is good and, if one excepts
1965-66 when the 8 percent dividend
was only barely (8.2 percent) covered,
so is that of earnings. And net assets
backing for the shares at the latest
reckoning was as much as 138 cents
a share. This could turn out to be
an opportunity stock at the current
price, especially for those who specialise
in low-priced shares and are prepared
to wait awhile.


Behind the balance sheets
Sydney Holdings’ wagon stays
hitched to a Holden
IT IS NOT ONLY General Motors-
Holden’s that is counting on a big
success for its new model HK Holden
released last month to restore its
slightly dented status; the same goes for
the chain of Holden distributors around
Australia who grew fat and lazy during
Holden’s halcyon days and have had
to come to terms with a new competi-
tive situation in the past few years.
So far, indications are that the new
model, with its variety of “options”
for “personalised motoring” (particu-
larly the introduction of a V 8 engine to
counter the staggering success of Ford’s
VBs) is going very well indeed; in fact,
too well for some dealers, who say that
delivery delays are building up once
again just as in the bad old days.
Dealer opinion is that public response
in the first six weeks of the HK’s
life is the best since the booming FB
model was introduced in 1960.
If this continues (in what should be
an expanding total market for motor
vehicles after a couple of dull years)
and if GM-H secures its objective of
40 percent of the market this year
instead of last year’s 34 percent, then
most of the Holden dealers (whose
shares are still selling at historically
low levels) are underpriced despite
some healthy market rises in recent
weeks. One of the most interesting of
these is Sydney Holdings, the listed
company of the F. W. Sutton group,
whose two metropolitan dealerships in
Sydney’s western suburbs (Chullora
and Homebush) and a country opera-
tion at Temora, are among the most
successful Holden merchandisers.
The Sutton group did not suffer
nearly as much as many other Holden
distributors in the 1965 and 1966 down-
turn as Holden’s share of the market
was severely reduced by Ford and
Chrysler. Tougher competition and
narrower margins meant that despite an
almost 40 percent rise in sales from
$11.4 million in 1963-64 to $15.7 million
in 1965-66, the Sutton group’s profits
dropped by about 23 percent. The in-
tensive reorganisation of dealer opera-
tions instituted by GM-H itself (which
was getting worried about the image its
dealers were projecting) had already
begun to have some impact on all
dealers’ profits last year, when profits
for Sydney Holdings, for example, rose
by 7.8 percent after a 7.1 percent lift
in turnover (even though profit on
shareholders’ funds continued its three-
year decline). And in the first half of
the current year, even before the new
Holden hit the market, profit had risen
by 6.6 percent, even though sales were
up only 4.2 percent.
So any significant increase in turn-
over as a result of the HK should
bring sizable rewards to those dealers
who have benefited from the GM-H-
-inspired improvements in efficiency and
techniques. Some dealerships will still
have to carry the burden of over-
capitalisation and excessive investments
in properties, but Sydney Holdings is
not hampered by this; its accounts show
a healthy relationship between fixed
assets and turnover—and certaintly a
far better relationship between stocks
and sales than most rivals. The Sutton
group’s stocks, which would include
second-hand cars for resale, total only
$446,324, or 2.7 percent of sales, while
those of its rival W. H. Lober make up
about nine percent of sales. And its
debtors are less than 2 percent of sales.
So the 11 percent increase in debtors
and the 10 percent lift in stocks in
1966-67, when sales rose 7 percent, has
not caused the company any concern.
The current ratio is traditionally low
in this company, but it has weakened
in the past couple of years. There is a
large mortgage loan for $384,000 on
freeholds which is repayable this year,
but presumably the company would
have no trouble renegotiating this.
In the past three years the company
has created a reserve for future income
tax (included as shareholders’ funds)
now amounting to $136,523, for reasons
of conservatism. Tax benefits are cur-
rently available on losses of a nameless
subsidiary acquired a few years ago, but
the company thinks it prudent not to
inflate profits now because of light tax
liabilities. So part of the provision
for tax charged against current profits
is provision for future tax, and-should,
to be consistent, appear in the balance
sheet as a liability rather than part of
shareholders’ funds.
One question mark over the accounts
is the company’s relationship with its
leasing associate, Sutton Motors
(Leasing) Pty. Ltd. This is not very
well explained in its report, which
simply reveals that an unstated con-
tingent liability exists to repurchase
vehicles sold to the leasing company
but that no loss is anticipated as a
result. This situation in effect means
a member of the group is reporting
profits based on the sale of items to
another but unconsolidated member at
undisclosed prices and with an undis-
closed commitment to repurchase them.
It would be useful for shareholders to
know how much is involved each year,
in sales, profit margins, and repurchases.
Other associated companies are Aerial
Agriculture Pty. Ltd. group, which with
headquarters in N.S.W. and subsidiaries
in Victoria and South Australia, spread
superphosphates, insecticides and herbi-
cides, and sow seeds. The group
operates over 60 aircraft and covers
probably five million acres. Sydney
Holdings has a 49 percent interest, the
remainder being held by several major
fertiliser manufacturers ICIANZ,
Cresco, Wallaroo, Mt. Lyell, and
Adelaide Chemical and Fertiliser Co.
Ltd.
Better seasonal conditions in most
areas where it operates have brought
some improvement to Aerial Agricul-
ture. Half of its work is in the New
England district of N.S.W., which
experienced a very bad drought a
couple of years ago. Current dry
conditions in Victoria and South Aus-
tralia are limiting the rate of recovery
in this operation, but it appears to
have an excellent future.
The fertiliser bounty provided by
the Commonwealth Government, of
course, has assisted this operation, and
Aerial Agriculture has paid 10 percent
dividends since 1963, submitting
$24,500 to Sydney Holdings, indicating
that, of Sydney Holding’s investment of
$260,000 in associated companies,
$245,000 is made up by Aerial Agricul-
ture and $15,000 by the leasing com-
pany.
This investment is still relatively
small, compared with the Sutton motor
business, which has assets of more than
$2 million (including a hefty $738,641
in goodwill) and which provides all
but 13 percent of the net profit.
Suttons has freehold properties at
Chullora and Camperdown, adminis-
trative offices at East Sydney, and free-
hold at Parramatta, a factory which is
leased for rental income. In Temora
the company has leasehold premises.
The two Victorian subsidiaries,
Pacific Motor Auctions and A’Beckett
Holdings do not contribute significantly
to group profit or sales.
Current dividend of percent is
nearly covered three times by earnings,
even though the improved net profit
after tax in 1966-67 was rather less
than in the three years to 1964-65
and 17 percent below the 1963-64 level.
Its 50c shares selling around $1 are
modestly priced to give a 6.3 percent
dividend return, and 18.2 percent on
last year’s earnings. They have been as
low as 87 cents this year; a rise to at
least last year’s high point of $1.32
seems likely in 1968.

Security analysis
O’Donnell Griffin: a live wire
in the electrical industry
OVER THE PAST 10 years, the elec-
trical-supply industry in Australia has
increased at an annual rate of growth
of over 9 percent: in particular, the
increase in installed generating capacity
has been 9.4 percent, in electricity
generated 8.9 percent, and in assets em-
ployed 10.7 percent. The rate of in-
crease tended to snowball in the year
to June, 1967, according to the statistics
of the Electricity Supply Authority of
Australia, with generating plant
installed, measured in kilowatts, show-
ing an increase over the previous year
of 17.2 percent.
In 1967, there were 3.9 million con-
sumers of electricity in Australia, they
paid a huge $607.7 million for their
32.764 million million kilowatts, and
although householders made up 85.8
percent of the number of consumers,
they used only 37.6 percent of the
electricity generated. By contrast,
commercial and industrial users
accounted for 59.7 percent of the elec-
tricity generated, and for 57.4 percent
of the revenue collected. On a State
and Territory basis, Northern Territory
md the race in the rate of growth of
electricity consumption in 1967, fol-
lowed by Canberra, Western Australia,
New South Wales, Queensland, Vic-
toria, South Australia, and Tasmania, in
that order.
One company sharing handsomely in
this growth of electricity is O’Donnell
Griffin Industries Ltd., the Sydney based
electrical contracting house, which has
been in the forefront of the electrical
industry since its foundation back in
1904. O’Donnell Griffin is by far the
largest electrical contracting engineers
in Australia—and more particularly is
in No. 1 position in New South Wales,
Queensland, Western Australia, Can-
berra, and the Northern Territory; in
Victoria, the company ranks as one of
the three largest in its field. Branches
are maintained at Sydney, Canberra,
Port Kembla (N.S.W.), Brisbane,
Mount Isa (Qld.), Darwin, Melbourne,
Hobart, Perth, and Bunbury (W.A.),
and men are on site in the iron ore
country around Dampier, Port Hedland,
Mount Tom Price, and Mount New-
man. The mining boom in Western
Australia has spread like magic through-
out the whole of that State’s economy,
and the electrical contracting business
in the West is now very considerable.
Western Australia represented 17 per-
cent of O’D.G.’s total electrical con-
tracting volume, compared to 43 per-
cent for New South Wales and Can-
berra, 19 percent for Queensland and
Northern Territory, and 17 percent for
Victoria and Tasmania.
Electrical contracting to O’Donnell
Griffin means the installing of electrical
power systems in multi-storeyed office
buildings, factories, power- stations,
mines; in other words the industrial and
commercial market, and the company
leaves the household market well alone.
Since going public in 1950, the com-
pany can report a rate of progress,
matching the increase in the rate of
electricity consumption itself: over the
intervening 17 years to 1967, total
assets have increased 20.5 times, share-
holders’ funds 13.7 times (they have
doubled in the past four years), turn-
over 17.2 times, and net profit after
tax 14.5 times.
In the management team, the two
sons of the founder, F. T. S. O’Don-
nell, constitute the group’s two execu-
tive directors, but family influences are
not otherwise significant, and the
family’s own shareholding in the com-
pany today represents less than 10
percent of the total equity.
Important as electrical contracting is
as the mainstay of the company’s busi-
ness, it does not overwhelm other group
activities, and the intention of manage-
ment is to maintain a balance of inter-
ests in other areas of the electrical
industry. The present composition of
group activities in terms of a current
annual turnover of about $lO million
was considered to be about the ideal
mix. Contracting is said to represent
about 55 percent of group turnover,
electrical maintenance and repair about
15 percent, electrical switchboard and
industrial electronic manufacturing
about 10 percent, and television
receiver service and hire, about 20
percent. Group employment is around
the 1000 mark.
Electrical maintenance and repair is
a “bread-and-butter line,” and is a
good sweet business to be in it is
never vulnerable to fluctuations in the
economy; it arises simply out of the
fact that even the best produced and
installed electrical systems frequently
break down. Maintenance includes
looking after electrical installations
once a contract has been completed,
and the company has built some very
strong relationships with its customers,
which often ensures that they are given
the job of servicing,
In electrical equipment manufacture,
the company has three factories in
Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth. The
original intention was to manufacture
switchboards as a captive outlet for the
electrical contracting department, but
outside customers now represent about
40 percent of the turnover derived
from this division. Although there is
fierce competition in electric switch-
gear, there are known to be about 37
manufacturers in Sydney alone, the
company has an immense selling
advantage which few can match in
being able to offer custom-built equip-
ment on a supply and installation basis,
and many contracts are now being
awarded only on this basis. The range
of equipment manufactured includes
415 v. switchboards, bus bar systems,
underfloor duct systems and motor
control centres. A separate department
produces industrial electronic equip-
ment specialising in rectifier units for
plating and anodising, for d.c. variable
speed motor control gear, for battery
charging units and for general-purpose
power supplies. Another item is in the
production of machine safety electronic
guards; this is a sort of electronic
beam mounted on metal-working equip-
ment such as big guillotines and presses
to guard operatives from losing fingers
and hands.
In 1960 O’Donnell Griffin diversified
into television maintenance servicing
TV receivers in the home, under con-
tract agreements with the major depart-
ment stores, and in 1964 operations
were extended into TV rentals. The
company operates in Sydney, New-
castle, and Gosford (N.S.W.), Bris-
bane, Surfers Paradise and Ipswich
(Qld.), and has a group of TV rental
showrooms in the Sydney suburbs of
Blacktown, Warringah Mall (Brook-
vale), Bankstown, Hucstville, Liverpool,
and Waverley.
In size, O’D.G. has over 50' percent
of the TV repair business in Brisbane,
and is one of the leading rental opera-
tors in that State, and is also one of the
front runners, although not the largest,
in the Sydney metropolitan area. In
addition to TV rentals, the company
also leases out in Brisbane two-way
radios in taxis, including the supplying
of the base transmitting stations.

more than commensurate with the rate
of growth in electricity consumption
itself. At $l.lB the stock shows a divi-
dend yield of 6.4 percent and the price
earnings multiple is 8.6. Its impressive
potential merits it a place in an in-
vestor’s portfolio.

A fluctuating but perpetual
profit growth for Hamersley?
DOES HAMERSLEY PRODUCE
iron ore or money? The answer is
both, and in good quantities. Last year
5,171,524 tons of ore were shipped to
Japan, and after meeting the cost of
these shipments the company had
$21,074,000 left over, which it used to
help in financing expansion of capacity
and construction of a 2-million-tons-
per-year pellet plant.
This year Hamersley's shipments
will be just over double the 1967
figure and its cash surplus could be
about twice as much, totalling between
$3O and $4O million. This immense
flow of cash will allow it to further
increase capacity, if required, without
any strain on loan repayment schedules,
even though these require accelerated
repayments so long as they total more
than half Hamersley's shareholders*
funds. These loans, which are nomin-
ally repayable at the rate of $l5 mil-
lion per year commencing next July,
call for additional payments of 50 per-
cent of Hamersley’s profits before pro-
vision for future taxation. During the
coming year Hamersley will be paying
$ll million off these loans and from
next year, when its net profits are at a
much higher level, annual repayments
could be in the vicinity of $2O-25 mil-
lion, and allow the company to repay
the loans in full well before the due
date in 1975. This higher rate of re-
payment means a savings in interest
of between $1.2 and $1.5 million a
year.
With savings like this coupled with
its ability to sell its products, Hamers-
ley is having no trouble in exceeding
its prospectus estimates. These were
for annual shipments of 10 million
tons of ore in 1972 and for a profit
after tax of $22 million for the year
to December 1971, By 1969 it will be
shipping the 10 million tons of ore,
and the $22 million net profit could
well be achieved in the same year, By
the end of 1969 capacity will be as
high as 15 million tons a year and
the company already has firm con-
tracts requiring shipments of 12 mil-
lion tons in 1972.
In fact, with possible interest sav-
ings of up to $1.5 million per annum
as from next July, it will be surprising
if the target of a $22 million net profit
is not reached next year.
Should the recent High Court deci-
sion confirming the availability as a
deduction from taxable income of
amounts spent by development projects
on various items of plant such as rail-
ways and port facilities stand unchal-
lenged it will considerably lessen Ham-
ersley’s future liability for taxation. Any
calculation of future profits is compli-
cated by this item, as it is not known
just how much the company intends to
provide for future tax or over what
period any concessions will actually last,
especially as there will still be a lot of
capital expenditure over the next two
years. And should the latest suggestions
of another mining development actually
come to fruition, the company's taxa-
tion position would change even
further. For these reasons it is impos-
sible to do otherwise than to assume-
that normal rates of tax will eventually
be incurred, and the company itself is
providing for future tax at very close to
normal rates on a per-ton basis. In the
last quarter of 1967 pre-tax profit per
ton was $2.66 and after-tax profit $1.64,
a difference of $1.02, or $38.4 percent
of the pre-tax sum. If this is to be the
pattern in the future, the $22 million to-
be earned after tax on 10 million tons
of ore appears to show the benefit of
accumulating cost savings on interest
payments and low’er per-ton costs of

production as each new plant facility
approaches its capacity level.
The use of any round figure on a
per-ton basis can be dangerous in cases
such as Hamersley, where a small
amount, like ten cents, is multiplied by
10 million tons and can result in overall
differences of millions of dollars in net
profit. In Hamersley’s case such errors
as occur on this account are to a
large extent offset by the company’s
size; on its 100 million shares differ-
ences of millions of dollars in profit
mean only a few cents per share. The
$22 million profit which may be reached
next year is equivalent to 22 cents per
share, and whether earnings per share
five years hence are 45 or 50 cents is
probably of little importance. What is
of more importance is whether earnings
can rise to levels such as these, and
justify current share prices of around
$B.OO or more.
So far, all of Hamersley’s profit
growth has been due to increased ship-
ments or iron ore, either as lump ore
or fines. As from last week, though,
future increases in shipments will be
partly in the form of pellets. So far,
Hamersley has only one contract for
the supply of pellets, requiring
1,790,000 tons per annum over ten
years. In the future the company is
likely to receive additional contracts
for pellets, but as the current plant
has a capacity of only two million
tons per annum, it is obviously not
banking too much on possibilities.
The point is that after next year
there will not be the steady increase
in shipments of lump ore and fines
that there has been to date. There
will be a jump in capacity from 10
million tons per year to 15 million
tons per year in 1970, but so far
there are only 12 million tons required,
and it is very unlikely that the com-
pany will plan further increases in
capacity until the 15-million-tons-a-year
figure is accounted for by written
contracts.
For these reasons, it seems likely
that profit growth will slacken off by
the end of 1969 (on contracts held)
and that after that time further in-
creases are likely to be in fairly dis-
crete steps. Assuming that the 15-mil-
lion-ton capacity in 1970 becomes
fully utilised fairly soon, is it reason-
able to expect profit per ton to keep
on increasing after loans have been
repaid and maximum efficiency
reached? If not, then the current share
price may be optimistic unless con-
tracts are obtained requiring annual
shipments exceeding the 15 million
tons capacity for 1970 at which
rate net after-tax profits should cer-
tainly reach 33 cents per share (at $2.20
per ton).
Regardless of its actual net profit,
cither per-ton or per-share, Hamers-
ley’s disposal cash income over the
next three to four years will amount to
a very significant sum, and by the
time that its loans have been repaid
in perhaps four or five years the com-
pany will have at its disposal an annual
income of $3O-$4O million or more.
Should further contracts be obtained
requiring expenditure on plant, the
company will be able to do this
quickly and cheaply with its own
accumulated funds, but if contracts
are slow in coming Hamersley may
be looking for a suitable use for these
funds and what better investment
than a business in which it has become
the acknowledged leader the devel-
opment of further iron-ore projects,
especially one which uses some of
Hamersley’s existing facilities.
But even if investment opportun-
ities in iron ore do not materialise,
the company’s enormous prospective
cash flow will ensure its ability to re-
tain a reasonable rate of profit growth
after 1972. Invested in Government
bonds at 5 percent annual investment
of $3O million would allow profit to
rise by a million dollars per annum
for ever.

Roll forged twist drills cost no more, yet are so superior in performance,
that the cost savings they make possible in your production programme
can mean all the difference between your obtaining full profit margins or
just getting-by! Is this a problem you’re facing? You’ll find that twist
drills made by the roll forging process have superior, heavy-cutting
ability, provide increased drilling rates well in excess of B.S. requirements,
and possess a hard, burnished surface-finish that ensures longer life and
fewer re-sharpens. Up to twice as many holes per drill! All this because
as the result of the roll forging drill-manufacturing process, the granular
structure of the high speed steel used, follows the contour of the cutting
edge. No interrupted end-to-end grain where flutes have been milled or
ground out. Roll forged strength throughout! For better drilling
specify P&N Roll Forged Twist Drills, Silver Jet or Black Jet surface

AND STATISTICS
The market was seemingly unimpressed by news of another
steel complex; BHP was up 15c on the week to $17.80 and J.
Lysaght firmed 2c to $3.40. DHA fell to its lowest price for 20
years, at $1.26. Takeovers created some interest in Sydney
retailers, including A. Hordern. News of feasibility studies for
new mining projects and the official opening of Savage River
did not sustain interest in mineral and metal stocks. WMC
traded down over the week to as low as $6.60, with $4.30 for the
rights. Similarly, Great Boulder rights trading finished very
weak, having dipped to $2.20.


THE LAND
Rural finance and rural debt
NOBODY CAN BE much impressed
with the accuracy of the figure for
rural debt dredged up by Mr. A. J.
Mclntyre (of the Reserve Bank) in
his recent talk to the Australian Agri-
cultural Economics Society. The gaps
in farm statistics are notorious; reason-
ably exact information on farmers’
reliance upon borrowing has always
been rather thin. Yet the extent of
present debt becomes especially impor-
tant when there is a pressing need to
restock after drought and when in-
creasing competition forces the
■acquisition of the latest technical equip-
ment.
Both of these demands are now (or
should be) hounding farmers. And the
unimpeachable trends disclosed by Mr.
Mclntyre won’t really be bringing them
any comfort, whatever the availability
of funds for their use. It is patent
that rural debt is still rising quicker
than income and may possibly be even
outpacing gains in the value of assets.
The ratio of debt to income has been
advancing every year since 1951; with
obviously reduced incomes in 1967-68,
debt must be currently moving higher.
Mr. Mclntyre blandly sees nothing
particularly alarming about the trend,
since “increases in land prices, until at
least fairly recently, suggested that pro-
ducers were not worried.” The high
cost of land, however, may well be one
of the principal causes of some stagna-
tion in farming, making it extraordin-
arily difficult for moderately financed
new blood to enter. At the same time,
less money is available for the most
up-to-date equipment. The situation
looks far from healthy when, for in-
stance, land prices in most New South
Wales local government areas are two
to four times above the 1949 levels.
The striking capital gains of existing
landholders can’t be the only criterion
of farming progress.
Certainly the Reserve Bank’s sample
survey of 197 drought-affected holdings
(grazing and wheatgrowing) in north-
ern N.S.W. does not show too perilous
a position on average. Yet five percent
of this sample possessed no non-farm
assets, had 25 percent more liabilities
than total assets, and were, therefore,
“in a weak financial position.”
No two farm economists appear able
to agree on an estimate of the number
of Australia’s poor farms. Some lately
quoted figures have varied between
25,000 and 80,000, and it is evident
that most low-income farms come from
the dairy industry. It is conceivable
that average farm incomes are roughly
in line with non-farm incomes, although
the farming average is over-stimulated
by high earnings from wheat, sheep,
and beef. Indeed, wheat and beef are
most likely the only sectors whose
incomes are moving up, and these due
to particularly favorable market situa-
tions.
The question of technological
advancement, however, remains, to-
gether with the ability of farmers to
call on money to acquire the most
scientifically advantageous machinery.
A high degree of modernisation is
growing more and more essential in an
industry which is going to face real
competition, and that not only inter-
nally. Surprising as it may seem to
many agricultural authorities, Asian
farmers have not been standing still,
despite their troubled lives. Numerous
reports are to hand of their striking
improvements in production. Markets
that have been considered a natural
for Australia’s exports are lifting out-
put greatly with the aid of the
most modern equipment.
Under such circumstances, local
farmers simply cannot afford to live
with old-fashioned ideas or work with
old-fashioned equipment. There are too
piany signs they are willing to. It is,
for example, distressing to learn that
around 20 percent of tractors in use
on Australian farms are more than 14
years old. It scarcely needs an agricul-
tural engineer, Mr. W. F. Baillie, to
remark: “This is not a healthy trend.
Overall it represents a growing cost
burden on Australian agriculture. If
any substantial proportion of these old
tractors are still in regular use as a
primary source of power on farms, then
all costs associated with obsolete or
obsolescent plant are being incurred.”
Australian primary producers are
well behind American, Canadian, and
South African farmers in feeling the
absolute necessity to keep technically
up to date. They could pay a heavy
price in terms of profitability at a
time of rapidly increasing costs. The
capital re-equipment of large areas of
Australian agriculture cannot, on both
an individual and national level, be
evaded. Perhaps an awareness of
heightened competition in previously
accepted “easy” markets will act as
a goad. When that happens, the little
matter of rural finance and rural in-
debtedness will also stand further exam-
ination.
Agrisearch
Stepping into greener pastures
STORIES HAVE been circulating
which suggest that the CSIRO Division
of Plant Industry has achieved a signal
success in plant breeding. It is re-
ported that one of its senior research
scientists, Mr. H. V. A Daday, has
created a pasture lucerne called Can-
creep. Unfortunately, no scientific
data has been made available, although
the eyes of the world have swivelled
on to this new hybrid.
Plant breeders in many countries
have been trying for decades to develop
a lucerne capable of withstanding
severe grazing while maintaining the
productivity of the hay types. But so
far they have met with only very
limited success. Until now, Canadian
breeders had come closest to the goal.
Moreover, a truly persistent pasture
lucerne could almost revolutionise live-
stock production in many areas of the
world. Probably the pastures of southern
Australia stand to gain as much as any
by incorporating such a plant because,
as presently constituted, their nutritive
value falls off badly in summer and
they make very tardy growth in winter.
Cancreep is reputed to be drought
resistant, flood resistant, and frost re-
sistant besides being resistant to inten-
sive grazing. Its growth rate in both
summer and winter is claimed to be
at least equal to that of our standard
variety, Hunter River. It is a prolific
seeder; according to newspaper
accounts, seed crops of up to 3001 b. per
acre have been harvested. The only
other figures that have been sighted
relate to a grazing trial that was con-
ducted near Canberra. After 17 months
of continuous grazing, 66 percent of
the plants of the Cancreep cultivar were
surviving compared with only 8 per-
cent of the Hunter River plants.
Commercial seed growers in New
South Wales and Victoria have been
informed that they can have some seed
soon. South Australian growers are
already in business, having been the
first to get small parcels of mother
seed. Plans for distribution in the other
States have not been publicised,
although it is believed that Cancreep

should grow well under Tasmanian con-
ditions. Other areas supposed to be
ideally suited to the present breeding
line are in Victoria and on the table-
lands and better-watered western slopes
of New South Wales. Selection within
the cultivar is confidently expected to
isolate types that will perform well
in the warmer and drier regions. The
new plant is said to be remarkably re-
sponsive to light summer rains and will
kick on with less moisture than even
the native grasses.
Hopes are high that an export market
for the seed will be developed. Argen-
tina and other South American coun-
tries are seen as potential big buyers,
and it may be presumed that North
America, South Africa, New Zealand,
and some European and Mediterranean
countries will be takers, too. Japan,
which has a large pasture-improvement
program going at the moment, has im-
ported a sample of the seed for testing.
Some 100,000 acres of undulating high-
lands in the Mount Aso area of Kuma-
moto prefecture on the island of
Kyushu are to be resown. Australia’s
relative freedom from lucerne diseases
should bolster any export drive. How-
ever, the official policy of the Austra-
lian seed industry is not to export until
the local demand is requited.
Cancreep has been derived from a
complex breeding program extending
over about 12 years. Hunter River,
Canadian Rambler, Hairy Peruvian, and
African lucernes all figure in its pedi-
gree. Hunter River would have pro-
vided the genes for high yield, the
creeping habit would have come from
Rambler, and' the other two parental
varieties are noted for their relatively
good winter growth. The Canadians
found their Rambler to be a pretty
unpredictable plant. It only rambled
depending on the density of the sward,
the season, the site, and the genetic
assortment of the seed. In addition, it
is a low yielder, especially in winter
when it becomes quite dormant. Con-
sequently, it has not won a significant
place in Canadian agriculture or any-
where else. When tested under Aus-
tralian conditions several years ago,
these inadequacies and inconsistencies
were very much in evidence.
Such a fickle parent must have pre-
sented Mr. Daday with a formidable
problem, and if Cancreep under his
schooling really has acquired the vir-
tues and none of the disadvantages of
its ancestors he has brought off a
coup to be proud of. With Cancreep,
he may have given Australian agricul-
ture its best boost since myxomatosis.
The true extent of his success, however,
cannot be gauged from the sparse, non-
technical information to hand. A search
of the scientific literature has failed to
turn up any paper detailing his find-
ings. Some might hold, of course, that
is a good sign, because nowadays big
technical achievements are rarely told
first to the scientific community as they
invariably were in former times when
caution was the catch-cry and didactic
deadpan description the hallmark of
genuineness.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A reasonable compromise
By JOHN SMALL
AFTER 150 YEARS as the most
favored form of orchestral music, the
symphony has gone right out of fashion
with composers. The techniques and
outlook of contemporary music are so
far removed from what goes to make
a symphony that anyone who writes a
symphony today runs the risk of being
thought out of touch, conservative, or
perhaps a little soft-headed.
None of these adjectives, however,
seems to fit George Dreyfus, whose new
symphony, optimistically called “No. 1,”
is to be performed by the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra under Ladislav
Slovak on March 23. Dreyfus, currently
creative arts fellow at the Australian
National University, was for years
prominent in the Melbourne branch
of the International Society for Con-
temporary Music. He has written a
number of works in a fairly avant garde
idiom, one of which, “From Within
Looking Out,” has been described by
a leading critic as “one of the most
accomplished scores to be produced in
Australia.” Why should this composer
turn round and write a symphony?
One simple answer is that the fellow-
ship gave him the opportunity. “I’d
never tried to write a symphony before,
but I probably would have at some
stage, even if I hadn’t got the fellow-
ship. But the fellowship gave me the
time I needed to write something fairly
big.” Other factors were at work, too.
“Living in Canberra has brought home
to me how important it is for a com-
poser to establish contact with a wide
musical public,” Dreyfus said. “In Mel-
bourne I was one of a small and rela-
tively self-contained group of musicians
who wrote mainly for themselves and
one another. We didn’t worry a great
deal about whether or not what we
were doing got through to the mass of
people who go to concerts, and because
our music was very, very up-to-date it
naturally didn’t get through. In Can-
berra things are quite different there
isn’t anything like the circle that I
belonged to in Melbourne, but there’s
a lot of people who are interested in
what composers do, and would like,
quite reasonably I think, to be given
something that doesn’t baffle them. I
found that I had a ready-made public,
but I didn’t have anything to say to
them. So I’ve had to think again about
who I’m writing for.
“The issue facing composers today
is what stance to take toward the
musical public. Since Beethoven’s time
composers have been getting farther
and farther away from the public, and
the language of music has been getting
harder and harder for the uninitiated
ear to follow, until now a lot of com-
posers write in an idiom that’s miles
away from anything an audience could
ever reasonably be expected to under-
stand. In this symphony I’ve made what
I think is a reasonable compromise. The
idiom is certainly 20th-century, but
there isn’t I hope there isn’t
anything obscure about the score. You
ought to be able to hear and follow
what’s going on all the time.”
The symphony is written for a fairly
large orchestra, including triple wood-
wind and four trumpets, and should
take around 23 minutes to perform.
The first movement is in sonata form,
the third and last is a passacaglia.
Throughout the work Dreyfus has been
very concerned with the practical prob-
lems of performer and listener. In the
last movement, for instance, the passa-
caglia theme goes through various kinds
of transformations time values are
lengthened, intervals augmented, the
theme turned upside-down but the
theme is easy to recognise in all the
forms it takes. At the end of the
movement it occurs once more in its
original guise. “This is specially for
the benefit of people who may have
got confused on the way through. In
case they’re wondering, here’s the
theme again; this is what the move-
ment’s been about.”
Despite his attention to detail, Drey-
fus is inclined to discount the import-
ance of form and style from the
listener’s point of view. “The most
important thing about a piece of music
is not what form it’s in or what tech-
niques it uses, but what you get from
it. Technical detail about a work is use-
ful to the composer or the analyst, but
from the listener’s angle it’s not import-
ant at all.”
However forcefully Dreyfus argues
his position, his about-face must come
as a disappointment to those who
admire the composer of “From Within
Looking Out.” Moreover, the question
arises whether Dreyfus, in adopting
a relatively approachable style, is being
true to his own creative personality.
It will not be possible to answer this
until the symphony and other recent
and projected works by Dreyfus have
had a chance to become well
known.
Vera Miles ... asking “What am I?”
Heavy on a budget
By CHARLES HIGH AM
A RAINSWEPT WHARF at Balmain,
Sydney, and it is the second day’s
shooting of Eddie Davis’ Australian-
American feature “It Takes all Kinds”:
American actor Robert Lansing is play-
ing a scene in a ship’s cabin, cramped
and claustrophobic, on board the MV
Warringah, as —playing a man on the
run involved in the robbery of a
stained-glass window from the Art Gal-
lery of New South Wales he is
chased out by police. There has been,
according to reports, no co-operation
from the Police Commissioner, who
refused to allow actual uniforms to be
used, and elsewhere a refusal to allow
the unit to use Vaucluse House, but
this, plus bad weather, hasn’t dampened
the spirits of the remarkably resilient
crew and director, and the shooting
even included a spectacular stunt man’s
fall 80ft. down the side of the ship on
to a tarpaulin-heaped wharf. This had
to be repeated because the cameraman
ran out of film.
There is a tight schedule, actual in-
teriors are used instead of sets, and
everywhere evidence of Davis’ efficient
bring-it-in-on-budget knowhow. Off set,
in her caravan, American actress Vera
Miles, who plays a wicked schemer (in
her own words, “not a heavy heavy
but a realistic heavy”), talked, against
a deafening clatter of wharf prepara-
tions for the shot of the big fall, of her
career from model to the excellent


actress of Hitchcock’s “The Wrong
Man” and “Psycho” and John Ford’s
“The Searchers.”
Perhaps her worst ordeal had been
while making an episode of the TV
series “The Outer Limits” called “The
Forms of Things Unknown” with Sir
Cedric Hardwicke, in his last role.
“Sir Cedric was very ill at the time.
He said to me, as he used a special
machine to inhale for emphysema, ‘l’m
going to die.’ I said, ‘But we’re all
dying, aren’t we?’ And he said, ‘I enjoy
smoking) but I didn’t enjoy it this
much.’ And that’s what I always tell
my children.”
She said that Hitchcock was not an
actor’s director but a technician’s.
“When I made ‘The Wrong Man’ there
was a scene where I had to go crazy.
He’d say, ‘How are you today, old
bean?’ ‘Would you like some tea?’ ‘Jolly
good show.’ Anything except what to do
with the sequence. ‘lt doesn’t matter,’
he’d say, ‘I have it in my angle.’ His
angle ! I thought, ‘What am /?’”
Theatre
Mild shock
By DENIS O'BRIEN
Fortune and Men’s Eyes, John Herbert.
Ensemble, Sydney.
GOOD GRIEF! Yet another respon-
sibility to fit into our crowded social
conscience . . . race riots, apartheid,
starving children in India, the whole
catastrophe in Vietnam, teenage drug-
taking and now the problem of
homosexuality in jails. Alert there, you
at the back! Stop whining about your
broken leg.
Playwright John Herbert, a Cana-
dian, hurls the latest problem at his
audience with unremitting fury and
gritty indignation. Only the dreaded
four-letter word seems to have been
expunged for Sydney (they’ve added
a fifth letter; opted for the common
euphemism) to protect the innocence
of hermits and, probably, to keep the
Vice Squad at bay. So far the Ensemble
has logged no more than half a dozen
walk-outs, which might indicate that
limits of tolerance' have risen since
the last Pinter in Sydney.
The play, with its manageable cast
of five and grim prison-cell set, makes
gruesomely fascinating theatre, and
Bryan Syron’s production for the
Ensemble Theatre contains more well-
timed and deeply motivated perform-
ances than I’ve seen at that method
house for a long time.
I have no quarrel with the play or
production as theatre, but take excep-
tion to the Ensemble’s cultivation of
a warped perspective on its subject
matter. By the very nature of the
management’s pressured publicity we
Rocky (Max Cullen) and Smitty (Sandy Harbutt) watch Queenie (Max Phipps)
rough up Mona (Fred Sims) in Fortune and Men’s Eyes.” Ensemble, Sydney
are being encouraged to accept it as a
universal social document. Most of the
talkback radio people and amateur
journalists were invited to a preview,
so that mass media had an immediate
flash flood of instant outrage and mis-
directed concern. Even ex-convict
Darcy Dugan was recruited as a social
commentator to add his opinions. Sud-
denly, anyone who didn’t express atti-
tudes about homosexuality in Australian
jails was in danger of being cast in the
same despised category as a Vietnam
hawk being interviewed by the “This
Day Tonight” team.
As theatre, “Fortune and Men’s Eyes”
plays suspensefully and places four
prisoners together in one cell under the
eye of a pathetic and half-heartedly
brutal guard. One of the prisoners is
a vicious queer, the others have been
corrupted by their environment and
the need for survival. But because of
the intensity of the theme and the
desire to hammer home this production
as an angry protest, the corruption of
the innocent is not sufficiently pointed
up.
Max Phipps puts down a gorgeously
full-blooded performance as Queenie
the queer, and is rivalled in excel-
lence by Sandy Harbutt’s controlled
playing of the corrupted Smitty. Max
Cullen, as a nervously menacing thug,
and Fred Sims, as a sad aesthete, sup-
port well.
When the Ensemble has processed
the answers to the questionnaire (“Did
the play shock you?”) it gives its audi-
ences we might get a clue to forth-
coming productions. Lesbianism in girls’
schools?
The same boat?
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Halloran’s Little Boat, Thomas Kene-
ally. St. Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
AS THIS is the umpteenth review of
Keneally’s play to be published in the
past year, let’s try a new tack. Could
there be a link between the experience
of the Keneallys and that of the lovers
in “Halloran’s Little Boat”?
Keneally left the Catholic priesthood
at 25 shortly before taking final vows,
and his wife, Judy, was a nun for seven
years. In a published interview she
describes the conflicts with her order,
and acknowledges the severe dis-
approval that followed her marriage.
Similarly, Keneally recounts the rigors
of the seminary and admits to a ner-
vous breakdown shortly before being
ordained. Their decisions to extricate
themselves from complete religious com-
mitment and their subsequent wish to
marry would have seen their own little
boat in some rough water. Certainly
most Catholics in their position find
themselves, like Halloran and his Ann,
in a storm created by the opposing
forces of authority and rebellion.
If there is a parallel here it adds
another dimension of interest to the
richest and most intriguing Australian
play in many years. In the play, the-
young lovers are devout Irish Catholics,
unable to marry, in a Protestant-
dominated penal colony. They dream
of a “little boat” which will take them
home to Ireland, where a priest could
marry them.
The play reminds me of “The Host-
age” in its Irishness and in the tender
joyousness of its lovers. And, as in
“The Hostage,” innocence and love are
seen to triumph over death.
It is reminiscent, too, of Albee, in
that Mr. Blyth (the colony’s lewd old
Commissary) and his cadaverous wife
indulge in a dialogue as virulent as
anything in “Virginia Woolf.”
And there’s also a resonance about
the play which recalls Miller’s “The
Crucible.”
Irene Mitchell’s production is her
best piece of work in recent years and
there are some compelling perform-
ances. Paul Karo’s Halloran is deft
and subtle. Sandy Gore, as Ann, shows
the difference between a simple per-
formance and a dull one, while, as the
Blyths, Sheila Florance and Joseph
James convince us they’ve been arguing
hammer and tongs for a lifetime.

Circus
Not very big top
By JOHN CARGHER
Moscow Circus. Melbourne.
THERE’S SOMETHING about a
circus. The sophistication of our age
has blemished the image a little. Too
often have we seen the best circuses
in the world in glorious technicolor or
on our little black-and-white screens.
Any idea that the attraction adver-
tised as “The Great Moscow Circus”
is an approximation of the circuses of
Moscow is an illusion. Russian circuses
are said to be the best in the world,
but neither of the Russian imports have
been comparable to Bertram Mills, the
Zirkus Busch, or the single- and mul-
tiple-ring circuses of the Americans.
What we can see here is governed by
sheer business economics and we must
be grateful for the opportunity to see
some world-class circus acts under a
genuine Big Top. But even a dozen
swallows do not make a spring, and
while the spirit of the Edgleys is will-
ing, the financial flesh is necessarily
weak.
None of which detracts from the
undoubted excitement which this enter-
tainment produces among local
audiences. Perhaps the second Moscow
Circus is not quite up to the standard
of the first. But it does contain one or
two superlative acts which must be
top-liners even in the best company.
The outstanding individual is Vyachs-
lev Anochin, who has the looks and
figure of those giant TV cowboys in-
telligent people pretend never to watch,
plus a decidedly lovable charm which
is completely absent among “normal”
heroic figures. He juggles with
numerous steel balls which you or I
would have difficulty in lifting.
There are no comparable solo per-
formers in the cast in the incredible
speed and versatility of the large group
of Tuvinian jugglers, and the tight-
rope dancers must be seen to be be-
lieved.
Films
Second-class
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Birds, The Bees and The Italians.
Director, Pietro Germi.
Point Blank. Director, John Boorman.
THOUGH GERMI’S rather sour
comedy has its moments, it’s a grave
disappointment from the director of
“Divorce—ltalian Style” and “Seduced
and Abandoned.” These were both
beautifully constructed films, the
cynical humor of the individual scenes
building inevitably to the final, dis-
illusioned statement of their thesis.
Here the theme is similar —an expres-
sion of Germi’s disgust at the gap
between true morality and the accepted
social appearance of morality. But its
expression is muddled, the haphazard
film - making itself often almost
amateurish.
It is made up of three stories set
in a provincial Italian town, uncon-
nected but involving the same person-
ages from the upper middle-class, all
of whom know each other and the local
gossip and are willing to condom-
promiscuity and adultery so long as
nobody’s tactless enough to make it
public. The first sequence is noisy
apd inconsequential, though it ends
with a really funny-sight gag. The
second a rueful examination of the
slim chances of true love against the
established order has some charm
but is far too long. The third states
Germi’s case with more like his usual
vigorous wit, in fact, it could have
stood up as a film by itself.
After a film so informally thrown
together as this, the highly organised
“Point Blank” a very fancy job
indeed—comes as even more of a sur-
prise. In any case, it is curious to
see a thriller treated with such style,
with Resnais techniques used for the
purposes of melodrama in which,
by the way, they’re more at home,
and considerably more entertaining,
than they were in Marienbad.
Lee Marvin, with his usual expertise,
plays the cold-eyed anti-hero who, after
being left for dead and robbed of his
share of the proceeds of a hijacking
by his wife and best friend, returns
to take his rights by force. There have
been objections to the excessive violence
of the film, which is certainly no
minuet, but as in “The Dirty
Dozen”—the whole thing’s too removed
from reality to offend particularly on
that score.

about such claims for aesthetic infalli-
bility. The paintings that have arrived
are pretty pointless, though one hopes
for more from the missing Hoyland,
Jones, Moon, Richard Smith, and Riley
that make up the 32 pieces bought for
about $30,000. (No matter; one critic
has “reviewed” the missing Riley
already; I tell you, get a concept or
a name and you don’t need a paint-
ing-)
Dangelo’s paintings remain effete
despite the fact that he was once a
revolutionary, manifesto man, but of
the 1955 Italian rebels only Baj and
Fontana are still at the barricades. A
polite action-painter then, Dangelo has
become blander and politer. Genoves,
who has a triptych where, in discs,
smudgy people encounter their tatty
white spirits, has been something of a
vogue; coming at the end of a great
wave of Spanish abstraction, he simply
trivialises what is justly called the
Spanish sense of doom. Even when
better than this, with people fleeing
from unknown forces or shadows of
planes to leave a few dead behind, he
does not rise much above a humorless
Charles Addams. We have similar but
better painters than Weiss with his
personalised clouds, and Sarkis with
his miscegenation of optics and serial-
ised collage; they might, of course,
demonstrate that our locals are in a
mainstream, provide fruitful compari-
sons, and allow us to flush all over with
chauvinism.
Mainstream-buying is eminently
justified, but it doesn’t give much
chance to the eccentric loner; further,
if we concede that kinetics is near-
mainstream, then there is a simple
difficulty: some art movements, like
Cubism, originate at their peak, but
others take time to reach their plateau.
On March 22, Frank Hinder, who first
looked at kinetic art 40 years ago, will
show some astonishingly beautiful
kinetics, like marine flowers unfolding,
at Newcastle’s Von Bertouch Gallery,
and, with few exceptions, his works
excel what we see at the Tower.
So, a quick glance at the sculpture
and on to the kinetics: D’Orey’s blue,
red-edged, farm-machinery piece sinks
into the floor, whereas the works of his
master, Caro, despite their actual
weight and absence of pedestal, do
not, but cleave and occupy the air
around; Garth Evan’s crossed beams of
battery yellow are robbed of formal
vigor by their blandness; Witkin’s
green snake, like a limply tumescent
phallic vegetable, is formally incon-
sequential compared with the Marl-
borough’s Piche we saw last year;
Scott’s play of tubular masses and
scalloped edges is mere intriguing but
lacks crispness. It’s a little like the
giant ice-cream cake that went soft at
the Art Nouveau Revival Picnic.
Why is the Tinguely so splendid?
Partly it’s as he says: “Above all, the
machine allows me to attain poetry.
If you respect the machine, enter into
its spirit, you can hope to make a
truly joyous machine by joyous I
mean free; c’est merveilleux, non?
Yes, because Tinguely’s is a rough
man-made object, its life complete
within itself, its power built in to
rock it, whirl the wheels, and send its
curved rod cutting briskly, while the
whole machine, clattering and clanking,
teeters like a tired kangaroo. Its inner,
inevitable completeness and associa-
tions with human endeavor are not
much found elsewhere.
Completeness has long been an
aesthetic criterion and the kinetics,
some internally lit, some externally,
and some moving as you do, just have
no beginning or end. We know that
broken Greek statues imply their com-
pleteness as do the Boto and Frank
Hinder’s work, but with the Sedgley,
with its feathery circles lit by changing
lights suspended above it, or with
Vandanega, with rings lit from within
and decreasing in size like a concave
target, it is like seeing a film without
ever seeing the start or end. It is no
use saying that these works are com-
plete when they repeat, for surely
repetition could hardly imply complete-
ness; in any case, variable after-images
make you doubt whether a repetition
has occurred. Some tell me that this
parallels life in the unplanned, unpre-
dictable environment. Well, Tinguely
answered the notion that destruction
equals completeness and death means
the fulfilled life by having one of his
machines destroy itself in the courtyard
at New York’s Modern.
Some of the kinetics are elegant,
sophisticated toys, titillating and even-
tually boring like Lily Greenham’s
turned-on fabric design, Frederickson’s
two little bugs under the nylon cloth,
endlessly chasing one another in the
cause of Art, and Demarco’s red-and-
blue spheres on wires a-go-going in
frenzy with a shivery, swishing sound.
Who is funnier? Kramer with his
tinkling, blurting bird-cages. Who is
more mysteriously subtle? Pol Bury
with his shivering grass and almost
imperceptibly moving rods and balls.
Who is more delicate? Gunter Haese,
whose quivering wire pieces tremble
as you breathe. (And there is Bilu’s
Sculptron 1 stored in Tolarno’s back
room —: no amusing toy, but an odd
presence.) But Bury, Kramer, and
Haese are not here; the Le Parc is
below his standard, but the shimmering
diamond by Boto and Tomasello’s
white cubes, colored on their backs,
on white are fine and there is an
intriguing kinship among Yuaral, the
subtle pair by Cruz Diez and a minor
Vasarely.
All are good pedagogical pieces as
they allow you to raise issues, but only
a few like Tinguely, Tomasello, and
Roger Cook’s Mute raise their own
issues. Mute is an actually upholstered
“painting” dimpling all over with con-
cealed smiles about man’s vain quest
for aesthetic certitude.

BOOKS
Strictly her own victim
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Les Belles Images. Simone de Beauvoir.
Collins. $3.15.
THIS, I FEAR, is the book that many
have been waiting for Simone de
Beauvoir can be torn to pieces with a
clear conscience. For years now she
has been the litterateur’s favorite Aunt
Sally, bringing out the worst in some
international critical circles, which have
often appeared to be attacking her for
what sne was while still being uneasily
aware of the merits of what she wrote.
Time does not stop even for blue-
stockings and (as so often happens),
with “Les Belles Images,” yesterday’s
revolutionary seems to have grown into
today’s conservative. The bright “new
wave” of contemporary French writing
has, of course, gone sweeping on with-
out her, but eyen within her own tradi-
tional style this novel must be regarded
as a retrograde step.
By choosing to deal with a deliber-
ately conventional manner with the very
milieu she has always despised the
affluent, unimaginative middle class
Mile de Beauvoir seems to expose her-
self as a sitting-shot. After all, her whole
life has been offered up as a public
protest against the standards of this
social stratum. If she had handled the
theme with Dolce Vita cynicism or with
a resounding pinch of bitchiness she
could have succeeded, but instead she
identifies herself with it and uses her
main character as a mouthpiece for her
own ideas.
This age-old and perfectly legitimate
literary device could have worked in
Simone de Beauvoir’s special case only
if she had chosen a figure of similar
background and stature. But Laurence
is comfortably married to one man,
has a brief “affaire” with another with-
out experiencing deep feelings for
either, has two daughters, a slight
father-fixation, and a mother who goes
off with someone younger and wealthier,
who in due course leaves her to marry
a former mistress’ pretty daughter.
Whole pages of it could be lifted out,
edged between the covers of a woman’s
mag, and never be missed. And this
from the creator of “The Mandarins”!
When Laurence dismisses the newest
French novels as “books that talk about
nothing . . . they don’t write to tell a
story: they write to write ... a descrip-
tion in three hundred pages of a sus-
pension bridge . . .” one is aware that
these are Simone de Beauvoir’s own
opinions and cannot help recalling that
she and “nouveau roman” pioneer
Nathalie Sarraute are reputedly on less
de Beauvoir ... jungle of empty words
than cordial terms. As a result of her
career in advertising, Laurence sees
everything as unreal—a series of beauti-
fully posed artificial images with a copy-
writer’s caption she is trapped in a
jungle of empty w r ords that mean
nothing to her any more. Here, too, one
remembers that in her autobiographical
“Force of Circumstances” the author
has hinted at being overtaken by a
similar fate.
There are, of course, some good
moments, such as the young daughter’s
questioning of the meaning of life and
her mother’s complete inability to give
any kind of answer. But in the end
when Laurence goes away for a Gre-
cian holiday with her old father and
(final disillusion) discovers even in
him only an empty facade, there is an
astonishingly clumsy attempt at an
analogy with Electra and Agamemnon:
when the revelation occurs, Laurence
is standing in front of the Lion Gate.
As an idea, this is more what one ex-
pects from a distinguished writer, but
again it just does not seem to come of!
stylistically.
“Les Belles Images” appears to lack
what has always been Simone de Beau-
voir’s staunchest asset, a burning sin-
cerity that has lent conviction to what-
ever she has done and which was often
very moving, even when the reader
did not agree (as in her foreword to
Violette Leduc’s “La Batarde”). Per-
haps de Beauvoir suffers, however sub-
consciously, from the knowledge that
one cannot turn out novels like this
today, and at one point has actually
stated what could be regarded as her
own epilogue: “You must admit that
there are books that can no longer be
written, films no one can look at any
more, music that no one can listen to
. . .” And here, at last, one may regret-
fully register agreement.

night. He was a ship with no anchor
and no harbor, floating aimlessly . . .”
This is how a contemporary observer
saw King Farouk of Egypt in 1950,
two years before the coup that was to
overthrow him and bring to an end
the corrupt dynasty of which he was
the last and least auspicious member.
By then, Farouk was already an obese
and ludicrous clown unloved by his
people, held in contempt by the foreign
powers which engineered his dow-nfali.
Yet it is a tribute to this biography
that it does convey more than Farouk’s
corruption and ineffcctualness, outlining
for us the character of a man ruined
by processes he neither understood nor
was able to combat.
In the history of the Middle East,
Farouk’s reign is at most a brief foot-
note. When he came to the throne-
in 1936, aged 16, the king was already
cast as a figurehead. British influence
in the country had been growing
steadily since the Sudanese expeditions
of the mid-19th century, and by the
1880 s the British Ambassador in Cairo
exercised a control over national affairs
greater than that of either king or
prime minister. Perhaps by design, the
diplomats holding this post were aristo-
crats, imperious and inflexible, ready to
exercise whatever measures might, be

necessary to curb the young king.
Throughout his life Farouk faced a
series of men, emerging from each
encounter humiliated and weakened in
influence. The army revolt of 1952,
connived at by the British, merely com-
pleted a process which had begun dec-
ades before.
Weak, companionable, clever, but not
very bright, Farouk should never have
been a king. His background was one
of Levantine self-indulgence. Coddled
by an affectionate gaggle of female
relatives, he lost touch with his aged
but virile father, who wanted him edu-
cated in an English military school. A
mother who dabbled in the occult
taught him to gamble in order to keep
him occupied, and from his early child-
hood his life assumed the aimless form
it was to follow through his 45 years.
Deprived of an intellectual basis for
his acquisitive and inquiring nature, he
turned to the hobbies that were to
dominate his life. He began to collect
stamps, coins, matchbox tops, and the
fascination with trinkets and trivia
appeared which was to become a ruling
passion.
Farouk’s time was brief and largely
without incident. Despite his devotion
to the Egyptian peasants, he did little
during his reign to improve their life,
or that of Egypt in general. The war
years were spent intriguing with and
against the Germans and Italians, or
contending with a British Government
determined to retain Egypt as a pawn
in the Middle East power game. After
the war came the Free Officers move-
ment, finally to be led by Nasser, and
Farouk’s clashes with his dissident
Prime Minister Nahas Pasha. Little
time remained for the liberal measures
the king had intended to institute, and
his self-indulgent nature soon made the
prospect of such action an unpleasant
one. Farouk the collector, the lecher,
the sybarite took over.
It is in this side of Farouk’s charac-
ter that Mcßride takes most interest,
chronicling with a slightly malicious
glee the aberrations and idiosyncrasies
of his sorry subject. Nor is there any
lack of material. The king, he reveals,
was almost impotent, kleptomaniac, a
heavy drinker in spite of his religion,
given to dubious practical jokes, a liar,
fraud, and vulgarian. With the dis-
passionate tone and dry language of a
career civil servant the author cata-
logues Farouk’s excesses, spicing the
narrative with gossip-column anecdotes
which reflect as poorly on the man
repeating them as they do on their butt.
Only in a few places does this
approach seem appropriate, one of
them being the final chapters which
describe the aftermath of the coup, the
sale by auction of Farouk’s enormous
accumulation of trivia, and the looting
of his palaces. The occasion has an
air of grotesque comedy; soldiers play-
ing football with exquisite Faberge
Easter eggs made of gold, jewels, and
enamel for the tsars of Russia; a rep-
resentative of the Egyptian Government
rising before the stamp and coin sale
to offer those who bid more than £5OOO
a free look at the pornograhy collec-
tion; the suspicious Egyptian Army
surrounding the auctioneer’s rostrum
with a ring of bayonets. Long extracts
from the diary of a Sotheby’s repre-
sentative involved in cataloguing the
collections have an amusing combina-
tion of dry detachment and specialist’s
fever.
“In one room is a showcase of porno-
graphic books, each opened at a suf-
ficiently exciting page. They are
mostly modern and French, but some
are 18th and 19th century . . . On a
table by the door is a magnifying pro-
jector and two boxes of slides. The
wall cases contain various ‘positions’ in
bronze . . . The second room is decor-
ated entirely by the watercolor and
chalk drawings of ‘F. Fabiano,’ who
has cleverly illustrated every variety of
normal sexual intercourse one can
imagine. The wall. cases contain such
an assortment of erotica as includes
amber phalluses, bronze love scenes,
pornographic cocktail glasses, and
corkscrews in every sexual shape that
the craftsman could devise . .
Long before his possessions had been
sold, Farouk was out of the country,
dispatched by boat with the blessing
of revolutionary leader Neguib. The
military may have been less happy at
his going had they known that the king,
with more foresight than an ancestor
who took with him into exile nothing
but his 300 concubines, had ballasted
his boat with whisky boxes containing
a quantity of gold ingots obtained by
melting down his wedding presents.
Before him was a lonely exile on Capri,
and an ignominious death from over-
eating in a nightclub in the company
of some anonymous “companion.” All
that remains are newspaper photo-
graphs of a fat, obscenely hairy man,
his face aged beyond his 45 years, a
casualty of a world too expedient to
indulge a playboy prince born 300 years
too late.

Poem versus tract
By MARGARET IRVIN
The Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayaam, A
New Translation with Critical Com*
mentaries. Robert Graves and Omar
Ali-Shah. Cassell. $3.40.
WE SHOULD, by now, be used to
Robert Graves rapping the knuckles
of poets mortal and immortal. It was
expected that Edward Fitzgerald would
eventually be frowned upon, for Fitz-
gerald took grave liberties with the
original text of Omar Khayaam’s “The
Rubaiyyat.” His translation claimed
that Khayaam’s philosophy was only a
slight variation on the theme: “Eat,
drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we
die.”
Over a century later, Robert Graves
and Omar Ali-Shah have raised their
hands in horror and have explained
very thoroughly why Fitzgerald’s trans-
lation was a travesty, and that Khayaam
was a Sufi, and neither a drunkard nor
an atheist. They have also translated
“The Rubaiyyat” into English. They
say it is exact. One takes their word
for this. No one would dream of
questioning their scholarship, but if this
is a literal translation it is also, in
parts, dull and pedestrian.
However, it is understandable that a
Persian scholar and poet would wish
to present his countryman’s work as it
was written, and . not in bowdlerised
form. Omar Ali-Shah writes: “It is
not easy for me, who as a child read
and spoke classical Persian, to have
patience with Western mistranslations

i understand that no sates representative
will call
of Khayaam. I feel outraged by such
wilful ignorance combined with the
crooked manipulation of verses to make
them fit alien patterns of thought.” He
is right, and Robert Graves supports
him in an excellent assessment of Khay-
aam, the sufis, Hebrew and Persian
'symbolism in poetry, and Fitzgerald.
But after reading this latest transla-
tion of “The Rubaiyyat,” one does not
really care whether wine was, for
Khayaam, the sufic symbol of divine
love, or whether, as a drunkard, he
drew more pleasure and happiness from
life than when cold sober. But one
cares very much that, if presented as
a poem, “The Rubaiyyat” should be
just that; and it is quite repulsive for
a poet of Robert Graves’ standing to
expect anyone to accept the follow-
ing quatrain and it is not an
isolated example as poetry:
That sin is irresistible, He knows;
Yet He commands us to abstain
from sin.
Thus irresistibly confounds us
With prohibition: “Lean, but never
fall!”
Where Fitzgerald used images, how-
ever erroneously, Graves inclines to
abstractions, and so his rendering is
not as vivid or melodic, truthful though
it may be.
One of the most quoted, or rather
most memorable, quatrains in Fitz-
gerald’s “irresponsible translation has
been debunked by Graves and the
following offered as the correct version:
Each rose or tulip bed that you
encounter
Is sure to mark a king’s last resting-
place
While scented violets, rising from
black soil,
Record the burial of some lovely
girl.
In Persian, the words “encounter”
and “record” may not be so hard.
“Scented violets” sounds pedantic.
Though some species are scentless,
everyone associates violets with per-
fume, especially in poetry. And if
Graves is so enthusiastic about direct
statements, “last resting-place” should
be “a grave,” though scansion demands
a little more. In any case, Graves
contends, corpses don’t bleed. Buried or
unburied, they don’t, of course; so it
must be the magic persuasion of vowels
and consonants —dare one call it poetry
in the face of so much disdain?—that
makes one prefer:
I sometimes think that never blows
so red
The Rose as where some buried
Caesar bled;
That every Hyacinth the Garden
wears
Dropt in her Lap from some once
lovely head.
And though it seems that in Persian
poetry rhymes are not employed, they
very often are in English poetry. They
have a strength and purpose we under-
stand and respond to, and Edward Fitz-
gerald was aware of this. But since
“The Rubaiyyat” is not. an English
poem, the Persians should have the last
word at least in their own language.
CROCODILE BIRD
There is a bird upon the river Nile,
Whose function is to stand between
the jaws,
And pick the murderous teeth of,
the crocodile:
A mad agreement, governed by
no laws.
Yet, we are told, it’s one that’s
never broken,
Though who would speak as the
bird’s advocate
In a dispute is something left un-
spoken:
There have been no complaints from
birds to date.
Likewise, between society’s sharp
teeth
The poet holds his dangerous occu-
pation,
Pecks at decay and seeks to cleanse
the breath,
Without protective law or arbitra-
tion.
Maybe the reptile has his heart in
his mouth,
And fears the bird, or holds some
superstition
Of a religious nature that’s enough
To guarantee his dentist’s safe con-
dition.
Some poets have been eaten in their
time,
At once, or piecemeal it’s the
risk they take
A hazard that’s endemic to the game
Played for itself, no great apparent
stake.
But the beast knows that he’s in
danger, too,
Must take on trust what happens in
his head.
The bird may pick his heart out, or
undo
His tongue-strings; intercept his
daily bread.
Starve him to death. A strange
accord
Of confidences keeps the system
stable
Cancelling debts of fear in an
absurd
Marriage of need. All feed at the
one talble.

information about that sunset period.
She is good-humored, and she has a
racy expert style that never (quite)
lapses into gush as she recalls a world
of vanished luxury and elegance.
In 1913, London was the most
dazzling capital of them all. Ragtime
filled the great hotels, and tableaux
vivants were all the rage. At the
Waldorf on New Year’s morning, a
prophetic entrepreneur showed Father
Time wheeling in a submarine which
bombarded a ship marked 1912. In.
the midst of the reckless gaiety of that
night, it was a scene that sounded a
clap of doom, foretelling war.
Miss Cowles amply evokes the
splendid atmosphere of the English
upper classes: the Duke of Portland’s
12 tennis courts —his guests could play
at any hour of the day undisturbed by
the sun’s glare—the Duke of Bedford’s
eight chauffeurs and indoor riding
school, the Duke of Marlborough’s pri-
vate cricket ground. Dinners in those
days ran to 12 courses, and at one
party (at Lady Michelham’s) a course
resembled lighthouses, with ortolans
representing seagulls, and a surf of
white sauce breaking over them.
Fancy dress balls, Diaghilev present-
ing three new ballets, Nijinsky and
Karsavina at their height, the
Marconi scandal, the sudden upsurge
of .the tango as the dance of the
moment; the fascination in reading
once again about these things is the
one we feel on looking at a documen-
tary, incomparably stronger than we
can get from any fictionalised account.
From London we are taken to Berlin
in “Hohenzollern Year,” the centenary
of the Battle of Leipzig; the Junkers
were lording it over Berlin society,
and the Adlon was the glittering focus
of a world. The Kaiser’s daughter was
married in a magnificent ceremony, the
Kaiser held his jubilee, and the first
half of the year was ablaze with cele-
brations. But in the second half Diesel
did his famous vanishing trick and the
L 2 Germany’s bravest new zeppelin
burst into flames in mid-air.
As Miss Cowles moves from Berlin
to St. Petersburg, Vienna, Paris, Rome,
New York, she summons up a wealth
of personalities seldom written about:
most notably, Luisa Casati, “a strange,
shimmering figure, attended by satel-
lites with gilded faces a sun-goddess
as conceived by Bakst,” who was the
queen of Italian society and the trium-
phant hostess of the greatest parties in
Europe, her soirees featuring braziers
and near-naked slaves, and even artifi-
ficial moons if the real one clouded
over. And Vernon and Irene Castle,
Isadora Duncan, the Vanderbilts, and
the Astors, Rasputin, Franz Joseph,
Anna Sacher and her famous Vienna
hotel. By contrast the ’sixties seem des-
perately dull, but then Miss Cowles
has not exactly been at pains to remind
us of life in the mines.
In a minor mode
By VIVIAN SMITH
A Look Around the Estate. Poems
1957-1967. Kingsley Amis. Cape.
$3.05.
GOETHE SAID there are significant
changes in literature every seven to
ten years, the timespan of a new
literary generation. It is not surprising
then that the Movement Poets are now
starting to look a little thin. All those
comfortable ironies, the poise leaning
toward smugness, the bland urbanity,
the too-accomplished craftsmanship:
they seem to have served their pur-
pose, and commentators are now call-
ing for a new apocalypse, a new
primitivism.
It would be a pity if these changes
in surface fashion were to go with an
undiscriminating rejection of what
does not happen to fit in with the
moment. There are many different
kinds of excellence in poetry, and one
or two of them are to be found in
Amis’ new book. Urbane, conscientious,
this is poetry in a minor mode which
rejects grand gestures for small,
irritating truths.
The book is divided into two main
sections, the first part consisting of
slightly muted lyrics, many of them
concerned with personal inadequacy
and the petty splendeurs et miseres of
lust. “The Huge Artifice” examines
Amis’ own early work while cleverly
probing the relation between, fiction and
reality. The poem “On a Portrait of
Mme Rimsky Korsakov” will remind
readers of similar poems by Roy Ful-
ler the almost obligatory piece on
the artist or musician; and one or two
other poems have a period flavor as
well.
The outstanding poem is the second
section of the book: “The Evans
Country.” This eleven-piece, wry, edgy
sequence is perhaps the best thing Amis
has written, and is immensely funny
for all its occasional savagery:
6.30. Balls to where. In like a whip-
pet;
A fearsome thrash with Mrs. No-
holds-barred
(Whose husband’s in his surgery till
7);
Back at the wheel 6.50, breathing
hard.
7.10. Briach-y. Pwll. Hallo now,
Megan.
No worse than usual, love. You been
all right?
Well, this looks good. And there’s a
lot on later;
Don’t think I’ll bother with the club
tonight.
Nice bit of haddock with poached
egg, Dundee cake,
Buckets of tea, then a light ale or two,
And ‘Gun Smoke ’ ‘Danger Man,’ the
Late Night Movie
Who’s doing better, then? What about
you?


CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM UNDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
Much has been written about wine
during the past few years and much
about the so called evils of “blended”
wines. Here at Lindemans we are proud
to present a range of blended wines,
many of which have won top show
awards, and all of which have won public
acclaim and finally, that sincerest form
of flattery, imitation.
The range is known as our Private
Bin range of table wines and consists of
vintage wines sold under constant bin
numbers. All the wines are blends of dif-
ferent vineyard areas and different varie-
ties, and this information is given on the
label so that the ultimate wine snob, un-
able to accept an evil wine blend, may be
put on guard before committing the car-
dinal sin of praising the contents of the
bottle! For the other 99.9 percent of table
wine consumers, the wines speak for
themselves each a distinctive type and
style, with slight variation from one vin-
tage to another, and representing the very
best value for money in the country.
On the technical side, these blends give
us enormous flexibility in our wine
making. A drought or crop disaster in
one area can be offset by wine from
one or more other areas. In any one
area, we can afford to be inordinately
particular in selecting only the finest of
our vintage for bottling as a district
varietal wine, e.g., our vintage Riesling
from the Hunter River Valley, or our
Rouge Homme Claret from Coonawarra.
Lastly, but by no means least, is the
matter of price. Good wine from the
Hunter is expensive, due to some of the
lowest per acre yields in Australia and the
constant need for vineyard spraying
against various mildews which thrive in
the sub-tropical climate of the valley.
Blending gives us the opportunity of re-
ducing this high cost, thus making high
quality wine available to even the most
modest budget.
Three of the range of our Private
Bin wines

Numbers of
good things in
the private bins
WHAT’S IN A NAME, or a number?
That’s the question, and failure to un-
derstand that the answer is no dif-
ference at all can lead even dedicated
oenophilists to reject some of the excel-
lent private bin wines that abound to-
day. The fact is that the private bin
number simply becomes another name
for a wine.
You know the ones that have become
the standard wines we see all the time,
the numbers staying the same year after
year, the varietal incidents remaining
true, only the vintages having been
changed to protect the innocent. And
while the numbers attract some, they
discourage others who have been in
the wine swim for some time and feel
there is nothing special offering be-
cause there is not a fancy, once only
number attached.
Therein lies the danger, for there are
some extremely good wines around that
bear these repetitive numbers, and they
do vary from year to year.
My job is to try to sort them out
for you. Johnny Walker of Rhinecastle
Wines fame apparently began the prac-
tice. Back in the mid-’thirties when he
was a struggling wine merchant, he
found that many of his customers were
having trouble with the private bin
wines that he sold them. They liked
the wine but forgot the numbers and
couldn’t keep up with the ever-chang-
ing titles. “They were just too darn
lazy,” says'John today. “And so were
the staff. And since I was doing all
I could to sell table wine and make
it popular I decided to put out a
special vintage wine year after year
that would have the same number.
My 26A Claret and Bin 84 Burgundy
started it all.”
Those numbers are still available to-
day. It must have been a pretty big
bin and far from private. But the
point is well made.
The major companies using this
system quote much the same reason.
The customer becomes used to a num-
ber and likes to stick to it. So the
companies provide it.
Arpong Lindeman’s private bins
there is tremendous value. For a dollar
or little over you may buy excellent
whites such as the Bin 77 White Bur-
gundy, the Bin 64 Chablis, and the Bin
23 Riesling. These wines are quite con-
sistent, and the characters and flavors
do not change greatly from year to
year. Sometimes one wine, like the
’63 Bin 23, does emerge as something
extra special, and everyone wakes up
too late. There is no need to be too
late with three available right now.
The Bin 45 Claret and Bin 50 Bur-
gundy of the 1965 vintage are both
outstanding wines for the money. Both
will benefit from more bottle aging
although the Bin 50 in particular is
very good drinking now. The other
outstanding buy is the Bin 36 Porphyry,
1962 vintage. Sweet wines are out of
fashion, therefore there is more age
on them. How else could you buy
a six-year-old wine as cheaply as this?
McWilliams are also doing very well
with their repeating numbers. I have
already recommended the Bin 56 Lexia
as being an excellent example of what
can be done with material that was
once used only for fortified wines. This
aromatic and full-flavored white has
great acceptance. Of the whites, I
prefer the Bin 76 Riesling. This is
made from the Semilion grape at Han-
wood. It is more complex than the
Lovedale Riesling of the same style,
but, again, both are excellent value,
being delicate, crisp, clean with delight-
ful fruitiness.
Of the reds I prefer the Bin 35
Claret. The ’64 example is made from
Shiraz and is touched with small oak.
This is a compensating flavor if it
is not overdone, and in this case is
well integrated into the wine.
The Penfold’s examples in this repeti-
tive number range cost more and are
worth it. In previous articles I have
drawn attention to the 202 Traminer
Riesling (the currently available vintage,
the ’67, being the best of the line-up so
far), the Blanquette 700 (’66 now), and
the 365 Pinot Riesling, one of my favor-
ite wines. Perhaps because of my recom-
mendations, the latter is now of the ’67
vintage. Both the ’65 and ’66 examples
of this number were very good wines,
and both still need bottle aging. The
’67 obviously does, too. One wine that
is good now is the 568 Hunter Valley
Riesling which is a ’65 wine.
Of the reds the Kalimna Dry Red
Bin 208 is consistent and does not vary
a great deal. Two outstanding recent
examples from other areas are the ’64
Coonawarra Claret, the best yet of this
number, and the blend, the Hunter-
South Australia Dry Red Bin 333 of ’63.
Both of these wines, like the Kalimna,
will benefit from some aging and will
reward patience.
I wanted to point out some good
wines to you, but I cannot resist another
comment. Since this type of number is
in fact a name, then why don’t the
companies just use names? Estate and
varietal names by all means, but still
just names.
Penfolds call their top two reds
Grange Hermitage and St. Henri Claret.
Nothing could be more prosaic, yet both
are rationed. Why can’t they all name
their wines this way?


LETTERS
The Task Force
I refer to your article titled “The
Task Force A More Comprehensive
Role” (8., March 2). It is within my
competence to take issue with only a
small, but to my mind very important,
part of the piece which is somewhat
misleading.
Squadrons of the Special Air Service
Regiment have been operating in South
Vietnam since June, 1966, with con-
siderable success. For various reasons
there has been little publicity given to
their activities. Special Air Service
operations are planned in minute de-
tail; the plans include all aspects of air
support. Briefings are thorough and each
soldier knows exactly what he has to
do in any contingency.
Soldiers of the Special Air Service
Regiment are carefully selected volun-
teers who undergo intensive training
for their specialist role. They do not,
as your article implies, indulge in Errol
Flynn type heroics nor do they “run
for their lives to waiting helicopters.”
They shun publicity but sometimes be-
come a little nettled when a normal
patrol extraction is written “Heli-
copters rescue patrol from certain
death.” The motto of the Regiment
is “Who Dares Wins”—they do.

Backing away from Britain
Many of the issues discussed in your
article (8., March 2), touch on Aus-
tralian Sovereignty and it would, there-
fore, be wrong for this High Commis-
sion to comment on them. Others take
the form of half-truths, hardly sus-
ceptible of discussion by letter. Will
you give me space to examine one or
two of your statements on economic
matters that do concern Britain and can
be easily refuted?
1. “. . . Britain’s devaluation knocked
something like 100 million dollars off
our London funds . . .”
At devaluation, Australia’s official
sterling holdings and liabilities were
more or less in balance. As the value
of both was written down equally, there
was hardly a loss on that account.
For some years past, Australia has re-
ceived a higher rate of interest on her
sterling holdings than she would have
obtained elsewhere. People use sterling
not because they love or hate Britain
but because it suits them to do so.
2. “. . . Britain, as a customer, has
backed away from us faster than we
have backed away from Britain . . . six-
teen years ago Britain took about one-
third of Australia’s exports, but this
proportion has come down to only about
12 percent . 4 .”
Sixteen years ago Australia took
about 12 percent of Britain’s exports.
This proportion has come down to only
about 4.9 percent. Who is doing the
backing away? Britain has adhered
loyally to the Anglo-Australian Trade
Agreement, which ensures a market for
a wide range of Australian products not
easily sold elsewhere, e.g., butter and
fresh canned and dried fruits.
3. “. . . There is still a tendency for
many British goods to be imported into
Australia only because of past associa-
tions.”
Does The Bulletin really believe that
Australian businessmen are so slothful
and inept as to buy goods that no one
wants out of habit?
4. “. . . The bulk of British invest-
ment has tended to be in areas of no
technology whatsoever . . .”
More than 500 British firms have
established themselves in Australia,
making chemical, electrical, .electronic,
engineering and iron and steel products,
providing money, jobs, and technical
spin-off. Investment in building and
services (what you describe as the Syd-
ney “office jungle”) has been additional
to this industrial development. This
week comes the BHP-GKN-John
Lysaght announcement of plans to
study a new steel plant in Australia
using the most modern steel-making
techniques.
5. “. . . Going Overseas . . .”
What does The Bulletin want
Britain to do about immigration or
overseas travel for Australians? The
two-way flow has never been greater.
Long may it continue. Of course, fewer
Australians are now going to Britain
for secondary and tertiary education,
but that is a natural and healthy
trend as advanced education grows
apace in Australia. More Australians,
on the other hand, are going to Britain
for training in advanced ' technologies:
that, too, is good for us all.

[Mr. Hall gives a tendentious and
misleading impression of what The
Bulletin article actually said. Here are
comments on the five specific points
he raised: 1. By quoting this statement
out of context Mr. Hall has disguised
the fact that The Bulletin article went
on to make much the same point as
he does, when it referred to the close
relation between balances and debts.
The Bulletin left open the question
of whether or not more of the Aus-
tralian balances should be kept in New
York, touching on advantages and dis-
advantages both ways. 2. Mr. Hall is
perfectly justified to make this com-
parison to offset the impression given
by the comparison made in The Bulle-
tin article. Readers should take both
comparisons into account. However,
his reference to “backing away” shows
a misunderstanding of the whole
article. 3. Mr. Hall’s interpretation of
The Bulletin’s statement is obviously
an unwarranted exaggeration. The
Bulletin did not make the absurd state-
ment that Australian businessmen buy
goods that “no one wants.” As well
as misrepresenting The Bulletin by
this interpretation, Mr. Hall has also
misquoted. The Bulletin article did
not say “because of past associations”
(which has a very wide and vague
meaning) but “because of the past
associations the importing companies
have had with British companies”: this
does not suggest sloth and ineptitude
but commercial habit. Mr. Hall, in
fact, cut a sentence off in mid-flight:
the sentence had gone on to make
several other points. 4. The reference
is to new investment. 5. It is sympto-
matic of what seems to be Mr. Hall’s
affronted misunderstanding of the
article that he raises this question..
The answer is nothing. The Bulle-
tin was simply reporting a trend.

Words, words...
If I understand Mr. Lynn properly
(8., March 2), he is saying, or imply-
ing, that works of art have their own
natural aesthetic impact quite irrespec-
tive of our human concepts, and that
the discussion of current ideas and
terms only produces a “haze” through
which we cannot see as clearly as we
might have done had we never begun
to talk. This view seems to me to be
utterly mistaken.
Responding aptly to a work of art is-
a matter of taking it in a certain way —
of attending to some things and not to
others, of bringing a particular frame-
of-mind to the business. What we
notice and what we commend depends
intimately on our notion of what a work
of art should be, do, show, express, etc.
In comfortable, stable times when
nobody has much doubt about what
makes a work of art, or how to take
one, nobody discusses concepts. But the
point about our times, I believe, is that
most of us have very serious misgivings
about what it is that artists are up to,
or ought to be up to, and about which
features of their works we had best
attend to if we are not to admire the
tuning-up and miss the concert. Works
of art don't themselves telf us what
to do. We decide for ourselves; and in
times of intense artistic ferment we-
have to thrash it out.
If Mr. Lynn only means (and I
suspect that this might be at the
bottom of it) that we must question
our terms in the presence of the
works , and not detach the theory from
that which is theorised about, then he is
certainly right. But if he means that
objects come with instructions about
their nature and function written on
their faces for anyone with eyes to see
—then he has to make out a case.
