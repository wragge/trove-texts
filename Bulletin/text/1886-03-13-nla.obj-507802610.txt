Unionists v. “Blackleg's”
The Bulle
SATURDAY, MARCH 13 1886
unjustifiable. Taking first the ease of the
strike of the Sydney stonemasons recently
in Mr. Jennings’ employment. The union-
ists had a clear right to attach to their en-
gagement as a body any terms they pleased.
They had the right to declare, before en-
gagement, that they would only work on
condition that none but unionists should
be employed on the simejob. They had
the right at any time during their engage-
ment, on weekly terms, to impose that con-
dition. Consequently they were justified in
declining further to serve Mr. Jennings on
his refusing to accede to that stipulation.
In the interests of labour, it was, we are
disposed to believe, a wise and useful
stipulation. So long as labour is divided
against itself, opportunity is afforded for
crushing wages to an unduly low scale. If
The contention between trades unions and
employers of labour has recently been pre-
senting some curious features, two or
three cases exemplifying a growing ten-
dency. The Stonemasons’ Union of Sydney
demanded the dismissal by Mr. Jennings,
the contractor, of a workman who is not a
unionist. And the ’Busdrivers’ Union of
Melbourne required their employers to re-
instate a discharged driver who is a union
man. The truest friends of trades unions
are, like the truest friends of sovereigns,
not those who crawl oefore th' m and ap-
plaud indiscriminately everything they are
graciously pleased to do. These are the
sycophants who ruin every cause they
attach themselves to. Now, we wish so
well to Trades Unionism that any de-
parture from sound principles on the
part of Unions pains and alarms us.
Abuse of opportunities has broken down
more monarchies than an exterior in-
fluence has undermined. And abuse of
of opportunities would just as surely ruin
trades unions. Now trades unions must
not beruined. Among all modern organisa-
tions they have been the be t and most
potent instruments in working for a fairer
adjustment of the proportions of profits
divisible between Capital and Labour.
Tuey have tended materially to improve
the condition of the skilled mechanical
classes, and there is room for hope that by
the extension of such combinations even
clerical and unskilled labour, which is ex-
posed to much severer competition than
regular trade handicrafts, may, in course of
time, also succeed in emancipating itself
from the severer forms of wage-slavery.
But with the growing strength of trades
unions has developed a tendency of the
most extraordinary kind. It seems almost
inconceivable that organisations which are
in their very essence the expression of
human repugnance to the tyranny of
cliques and classes, should so early in their
career become infected with the vtry dis-
position which they aim at combatting,
Yet this is exactly what their action in the
Jennings case exera plifles.
♦ * *
We will not concern ourselves with the
legality or illegality of the course pursued.
It is so recently that merely to combine in
a trades union was a gross illegality that
any argument drawn from the condition of
human enactments must, especially in refer-
ence to the actions of associated labourers, be
open to challenge. Trades unions were fair
and honest combinations while participation
in them exposed workmen to [legal prosecu-
tions and convictions. There are many
acts of the “people,” even now, which are
not only just but salutary, and which are,
nevertheless, violations of the enactments
placed upon the dtatute Book by the pro-
pertied classes for the belter maintenance
of their system of “ sweating ” the workers.
But we have always endeavoured, and
always do endeavour, to distinguish between
natural justice and merely human enact-
ments. The latter, in too large a number of
instances, merely represent the machinery
by means of which dominant castes endea-
vour to perpetuate aud enforce the wrongs
they inflict upon the mass of mankind.
Therefore, our criticisms are based, as nearly
as we can manage to keep them, upon
natural justice and moral right.
♦ * *
Tested by this standard, the recent pro-
ceedings of trades unionists in the eases
w e have referred to, and the general
tendency of these organisations, appear
MR. JAMES HENRY YOUNG, M.L.A.
(Photo, by Freeman and Co)
in any trade the unionists exceed the non-
unionists sufficiently to render the latter
impotent for independent action—that is to
say, to make it impossible or difficult for
any considerable works to be carried out by
non-unionists alone—-it is a sagacious policy
for unionists to refuse to work where non-
unionists are employed. For it is the true
jntereet of all labourers to join and support
the unions of their trades, as their influence
is invariably in the direction of the improve-
ment in the wage rates, and consequently in
the social, and ultimately in the intellectual,
condition of the individual worker. It must
be perceived that the average intelligence
of a class is, broadly speaking, propor-
tionate to the earnings. That is to
say, that with money comes refinement,
and with leisure comes self-instruction. This
is true up to a certain level. Superfluity
makes comfort and refinement give place
to luxury and arrogance, and narrow-
minded prejudice is equally the vice of the
down-trodden and of the over-wealthy.
Hence, pressure exerted upon non-unionists
with the intention of pushing them into the
union ranks, is pressure exerted in a bene-
ficial direction. But care must be taken to
observe and respect the line which separates
a fair influence of that kind from violence
and tyranny. The unionists, of all men,
themselves ranked in line to oppose a
tyranny from which they have scarcely yet
emancipated themselves, should be jealously
careful not to exercise tyranny in their turn.
They must study the distinction between
pressure and oppression. Non-unionists
may be stupid, perverse, and blind to
their own ultimate interests. But no
sophistry will suffice to justify a practice of
treating either stupidity or blindness as a
penal offence. Union mechanics should
know, from their own constant experience,
that oft-times a working-man positively
cannot afford to bo just to himself, his
order, or to act upon his inward convic-
tions. A man may be so circumstanced
that he must accept work under any con-
ditions or perish—he and his. Working-
men have been victims so long that their
sympathies and recollections should deter
them equally from expecting individuals
to voluntarily make themselves martyrs to
the cause, and from sacrificing as martyrs
unwilling victims.
• ♦ •
It goes without saying that in oases where
the supply of non-union labour is adequate
to carry out the works necfssary in a com-
munity, refusal on the part of unionists to
work where non-unionists are employed
would be merely suicidal. Under such cir-
cumstances, their proper course would be
proeelytism—nover difficult for them, inas-
much as they have rtasm, a good came,
and real identity of interests to work upon.
But intimidaiUn and violence, such as
appeared to bo regarded as welcome weapons
at a recent meeting in connection with the
Jennings case, are stupid and mischievous.
If these be permhsiole resources by union-
ists ag mist non unionists, capitalists will
need no prompting to accept the lesson, and
to use Intimidation and violence against
trades-unionis s. It is only yesterday, as it
were, that Capital abandoned those instru-
ments by abolishing the laws against trades
unionism itself. They will be ready enough
to rerert to the old system, if an excuse be
furnished such as intimidation by unionists.
The managers and leaders of the unions
must not fancy that the victory is consoli-
dated. Capital yet stands Jealously in ob-
servation, ready to recover all its advan-
tages if it perceive a promising opportunity.
• ■ •
Black-legs are provoking creatures. They
comprise but too many of the meanest sort
of men—favour-curriers, dullards, sneaks,
and traitors. In every gnat constitution
traitors are to be found, and these have
always excited sharper hatred than the
actual enemy. A corquored or captured
foe is admitted to quarter and treated with
respect. But a traitor is Jgnominiously
hung. And so too with rebels. In the pre-
sent contest Labour v. Capital are the com-
batants, just as in the internecine war be-
tween; North and South, in the United
States, Northerns fought Southerners, And
there are citizens who honestly believe that
trades unions do more harm than good-
limiting the demand by increasing the price
of labour and tightening the stringency
of the labour market, Just as there were
Southerners in America who were out of
sympathy with the cause of Secession. Con-
scientious dissidents such as these merit
honourable consideration. But the crea-
tures who, while profeseirg loyalty to a
cause, seek a personal advantage by betray-
ing ir, or who, for obviously selfish motives,
refuse their allegiance, deserve severe treat-
ment and earn all the obloquy which can be
cast upon them. Trade black-legs may
belong to eithtr class, and just as in a war it
is practically impcssibleto discriminate be-
tween persons who d ssent from what is the
general cause, on conscientious motives,
from the rcotiles who seek advantage by
treachery, so it is with Labour and Capital.
It is inevitablethat the labourer who refuses
to enroll under the standard of his order,
must be classed with traitors, no matter
how pure may be his motives. We re-
gard workmen who decline to affiliate
themselves with the unions of their
trades s s lacking in sagacity and pub-
lic spirit, and fail to see that they ean
reasonably complain, although they be con-
founded in the general contempt of their
united fallows. Scorn, however, is no ex-
cuse for violence, and around personal
liberty to join or hold aloof from an associa-
tion the common law must continue to hold
its sheltering protection The tyranny of
trades unions is no less reprehensible than
the tyranny of a throned despot or of a
privileged caste.
♦ * *
With respect to the demand by the Mel-
bourne unionists that a discharged em-
ployee should be re-engaged—this exactly
reversing the demands of the Sydney stone-
masons—-the claim appears quite void of
moral force. The relations of employer and
employee involve more than questions of
competence, A man may be a good hand,

and a decent fellow, and yet not so consti-
tuted as to be in pleasant relations with an
employer, while he might get along'har-
moniously with another. Allowance for
differences of temperament must be made in
such matters. Any to establish a
system of compulsion in this respect must
fail, because it antagonises a law of nature.
There are difficulties and repulsions between
men which could not be overcome. So long
as an employer works with union hands,
trades unions will have to be content. It is
useless and impertinent for them to attempt
to dictate as to the particular individuals to
be in this or that master’s employment.
If an employer declines to work with
unionists exclusively, all unionists can
leave him alone, to take his chance
of supplying their places with non-
unionists. But, further than that, their
collective rights do not go. In the particu-
lar case under notice, the plea of the em-
ployer, whether it be accurate or not, ex-
poses the unaoundness of the position
sought to be assumed. The employer
alleged that he is reducing his establish-
ment. Now, no influence on earth can com-
pel an employer to pay more ’hands than
his business requires or will support. Com-
pliance with demands to continue to employ
eleven men, when there is only work for ten
to do, would, in many instances, simply
mean acceptance of ruin. It represents an
unproductive outlay of nearly 10 per cent.
And 10 per cent, on the turnover is, in a
great many cases, more than a business
man’s entire profits. If trades unions are to
maintain their ground and to extend their
Influence among working-men—as we trust
they will—they must be managed with
sagacity, and their operations conducted
with deliberation and without passion.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Libelling Australians.
Mr. FrOUde, eminent although he is as a littera-
teur, has evinced the same stupidity as seems to
afflict every " distinguished visitor ” who pays a
flying visit to these colonies. On the strength of
a sojourn of three weeks in New South Wales he
considered himeelf master of the whole situation.
He sat down and wrote his opinions, not modestly
as being merely the slight impressions of one who
was conscious that solid convictions can only
justly be formed after prolonged and exhaustive
investigation of a subject, but with the cock-a-
hoop assurance of a vain man. He was run after
-as is usual in the case of any man of mark who
visits this part of the world-by our leading par-
venus. By these he was coddled and surrounded.
They fed and feted him, assumed their best and
newest company manners, hedged him round from
contact with the mere rank and file of colonists,
and when he was gone, awaited with complacent
expectation, recompense in the form of a compli-
mentary notice in nis book. And they have not
been disappointed. Mr. Froude has done the
handsome thing by his hosts, and they are distin-
guished by name as among the most gifted, most
amiable, most remarkable individuals he has ever
met. But poor Mr. Froude would, perhaps, have
gushed with lees effusion had any glimmering
dawned upon him of the extent to which his
obliging toadies were “giving him away.” A
parvenu, arrived at “ position,” invariably imi-
tates or developes the worst distinguishing quali-
ties of the privileged classes. There are no such
Tories in New South Wales, and no such
exacting social exclusives as the persons
who have risen to public station, or ar-
rived at great wealth, from the meanest
origin. Brought in contact with persons of that
sort, poor Mr. Froude allowed himself to be
crammed with what he was simple enough to
believe was Australian public opinion. Thus he
was fooled Into pronouncing that in Victoria Con-
stitutional Government was so discredited that
reversion to the status of a Crown colony was in-
evitable before long, the truth being that the
Victorian people would rise in armed insurrection
If any attempt to rob them of their Constitution
were attempted. Similarly in New South Wales,
he was crammed with the Action that the colonists
held Gladstone in abhorrence and revered the
memory of the mountebank, Beacons held, the
truth being that there Is no English-speaking com-
munity where the great Liberal leader is held in
more general reverenee and esteem. Mr. Froude
Is a clever man and a writer of singular force and
beauty of style. But he is himself a bitter Tory,
and perhaps deserved no better fate than to fall
Into the hands he did, and to be gulled to the top
of his bent with fictions pleasing to his precon-
ceptions.
That Infamous Treason Felony Aet.
Slit Henry Parkes complains that In ascribing
to him, in our last issue, the responsibility for the
Treason Felony Act passed during the excitement
following O’Farrell’s attempt upon the life of
the Duke of Edinburgh, we have done him an in-
justice. A reference to the records of the time
shows that, technically speaking, Sir Henry Is
correct. The bill was not Introduced by him, and
he did not speak in the debate which preceded its
adoption. The history of the Act is that it was in-
troduced by Mr. Martin, now Sir James, who
Was at the time Premier and Attorney-General.
Sir John Robertson seconded the motion to sus-
pend the standing Orders, to allow of the bill
being passed through all stages in a single day.
The first seven or eight clauses were simply
copied from the English Act, passed under the
excitement of the Fenian scare; but several
following clauses were added by Mr. James
Martin. Of these, the 9th clause was the
most extraordinary. It was worthy of the
worst features of Russian ukases. It pro.
Tided that any one speaking disrespectfully
of the Queen, on refusing to join in the toast of
her health should be liable to the penalties of the
BiU, gir Henry Parkes was Colonial Secretary iq
the Martin Ministry, and although he did not
speak in the debate, he voted for the Bill*
which was passed by an Immense majority! Mr.
Garrett has the credit of having spoken and
voted against this measure, which reflects dis-
grace upon its authors and supporters. Mr. John
Lucas— honest John— supported the motion. The
Bill passed through the Upper House also in one
night, without amendment. The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, commenting upon, the measure,
expressed the opinion that, “the moral
effect of this law will doubtless be bene-
ficial.” And thirty-six hours after its final
reading-that is to say, after opportunity
for reflection—the same journal it remarked, in
reference to the 9th clause, relative to a refusal
to drink the Queen’s health,—“We do not see,
after what has transpired in this colony, that a law
of this kind is not admissable.” And the Herald
supported the Act almost without reserve.
Sir Henry Parkes is entitled to the benefit of the
foregoing corrected statement. It is certainly
more in keeping with the reputation of Sir James
Martin, than with the character of Sir Henry
Parkes, to have been the originator of a measure
so subversive of what is popularly known as
British liberties. There is reason to lament, never-
theless, that Sir Henry, in lieu of tacitly acquies-
cing in the Bill, and of voting for it, did not
oppose it with all his powers, and even in the
modified light it is now presented the affair is not
one which reflects crc|lit upon him as a Liberal
statesman. No better apology can even now be
offered for his share in the disgrace than we ad-
mitted last week, namely—That he did but share
in the general hysterical excitement of the time,
instead of evincing true greatness of soul by
towering over the pigmies of that day, superior
alike to them, to a transitory excitement, and to
popular clamour.

Hechabites anl Bum.
The New South Wales Local Option League pro-
tests “against any persons pecuniarily engaged in
the liquor traffic having seats upon the Royal
Commission ” to inquire into the liquor question,
but strangely enough in moving this protest the
Rev. F. B. Boyce (whose intellectual brilliancy,
by the way, has never been so great as to cause
much alarm to his friends) ingenuously admitted
that the matter had been somewhat altered by the
inclusion of Messrs. Hutchinson and John
Tombstone Roseby. This protest is about as fine
a sample of party bigotry as anything the records
even of local optionism itself have ever shown.
From it we see clearly enough the wish of the
League to prevent any but teetotal advocates
from membership on this commission. The
local optionists would perhaps like to see
the fluent Mr. Richardson, who comprehen-
sively describes publicans as “ legalised mur-
derers,” appointed chairman, with the Rev.
Boyce, and other teetotallers, including that
clerical Demosthenes who denounced liquor as
“liquid Are and distilled damnation,” as h’s co 1 -
leagues. But such a commission would be scouted
by the public of New South Wales who desire to
obtain reliable facts concerning the liquor trade.
As well might one try to get an Impartial review of
the 39 Articles of the Protestant faith from Arch-
bishop Moran, or an unprejudiced history of the
Popes from Zachary Barry, as a truthful report
on the liquor question from a committee of tee-
totallers. It is not that these latter are liars with
intent, but being intoxicated with prejudice, and
inebriated with party bigotry, they habitually
make statements which are irreconcileable with
truth, justice, or charity. The prominent teeto-
tallers of the city regard the cold-water cure as a
panacea for all evils of modern civilisation. Pull
local option is to them the dawn of the millennium.
Little wonder that they should become mentally
drunk with the prospect, but the fact of their
being so does not furnish an excuse for their
foisting on to their sober brethren a vivid des-
cription of the liquor traffic in the guise of a
striped snake, or detailed accounts of visions of
the publicans masked as spotted dogs. The report
of a teetotallcommlssion would be a strlped-snake-
and-green-dog production, therefore it Is a matter
of satisfaction that there are men on the other
side who will insist upon separating the utterly
fanciful, from the substance of facts, and produce
only the latter. Perhaps this is the reason why
some of the Optionists desire to abandon connec-
tion with the commission altogether,—they do not
desire a report at all, unless they can dictate its
terms. The most satisfactory commission would
be one composed of neutral men, but if the pro-
fessional accusers of publicans are permitted to sit,
the latter, in all justice, must be allowed repre-
sentation that they may be defended from the
attacks of those who hold retainers from the
opposite interest.
The special train business In New South Wales
is a highly artistic form of public robbery
for which no one is directly responsible. Special
trains are allowed for the convenience of Cabinet
Ministers, and for the pleasure of such peers, dis-
credited or otherwise, as choose to visit Australia.
Such inflictions the taxpayers have mutely borne
hitherto, but there is a limit beyond which public
endurance will not go, and that point was surely
reached when a special train was provided for
the conveyance of a few firemen from Sydney
to Melbourne on Sunday last. Why the coun-
try should be called upon to pay for a
special for nearly 400 miles to suit the
dignity and convenience of a couple of dozen
of noisy and demonstrative firemen going to com-
pete for the amateur water-spouting champion-
ship of Bungaree is a mystery, which we hope the
present Minister for Works will be called upon to
explain. If it was necessary that these heroes
snould travel free, why not give them passes
simply, instead of a special train ? There is only
one reason why a Sunday special should have
been put on for these firemen,—the passengers by
ordinary train might have objected to travel with
such boisterous and exhilarated mortals.

The narrow majority in the House of Commons
of 80 against Mr. Labouchere’3 motion to abolish
the hereditary principle in the House of Lords, Is
the shadow of the coming event. It may be that
the division was taken in a thin house, and there-
fore cannot be regarded as an accurate test of
opinion, but considering that the motion was sub-
mitted by the Inveterate foe of heredity,
it is only fair to suppose that strong efforts
were made to ensure a strong muster on
the Conservative side. A proportionate ma-
jority In ths New South Wales Assembly
would only be a fraction less than seven votes—a
very small number for the progress of thought to
entirely efface. In any case, this vote must clear
the way for Conservative concessions. If so in-
significant a barrier prevents the people from
invading the territory of a comnany of nerveless
lotus-eaters, the most haughty even of the peers
will see the necessity of assenting to considerable
sacrifices to preserve the remainder of their estate
—they must give their £5OO to prevent the nation
from laying violent hands upon the accumulated
capital of privileges possessed by their class.
Under any circumstances this vote must be a por-
tentous one for England’s alleged “ statesmen by
hereditary right.”

states that Prince Henry

Beatrice, had been re-
hearsing the matrimonial

had unfortunately con-

of his engagement to
the daughter ot a Rtyal

and then maddened her.
There was a great noise,
and no smail difficulty
was experienced in keep-
ing it from the ears of
those who would have
been prejudiced against
the young man in conse-
quence. In the end a
golden salve was applied
to the female’s sere heart,

with only the loss of a
handful of hair. Prince

attended by those ot the

who wish to be con-
sidered “ in Society.” Cer-
tain members of the local

objected to a well-known
athlpte being admitted
to Government House
because scandal has been
busy with his name of
la'e. As Sir George
btrahan is not a man to

clined to take notice of
the protests made. At a
recent “at home ” the
gentleman so referred to

to an invitation given as
usual, and on entering
they were greeted smoe-
what coldly, three or four
families immediately
leaving the drawing-
room. The question
naturally suggests itself,
“ Why did they leave?
Was it because they
could not breathe the
same atmosphere inhaled
by the ostracised member
of “ society ? ’ If so, how
do they reconcile their
action with the fact that
they had not objected to
the company of another
individual present in the
drawing-room, who had
been forced to leave high
office in consequence of
acts which should for
ever have excluded him
from decent society ; or
to the company of an-
other visiter who had
taken advantage of a po-
sition of trust to act
queerly —“ to put it

doubt, is quite sufficient
attraction to those who
can conveniently draw a
line as to when and where
they feel themselves
called upon to exhibit a
little virtuous indigna-
tion. We live in a world
of cant and must look
for such incidents as
these. At the same time
it is rather hard on the

motto which does not

“ The Queen,” says an English writer,
“daily grows more nervous about being thronged.
A crowd at a sufficient distance is well enough;
but for it to swarm about her carriage nils hor
with unaccountable apprehension. The voices of
the people, if raised in praise of her, are pleasant
to her ears; but distance lends enchantment, and
her subjects must not come near enough for their
breath to fan her brow.”
The papers generally consider that the
Queen looked “ young ” the day she went to open
Parliament. We don’t know how we bear our
years, except that those we meet are not offu-
sively complimentary. Put us in a coach behind
eight horses, though, and we might look young,
too. We know we feel young even when behind
two horses, and we have convinced the driver that
we have had the misfortune to lose our tickets.

possible, for the ennobled Montague Corry is,
above all things, a courtier. The Queen, more-
over, is considerably interested in the “ Beacons-
field Memoirs,” which the faithful Rowton is
editing. In those memoirs we may expect to find
some spicy epigrams anent the Grand Old Man.

If told to do such light
work as cleaning a step,
he would answer, “Yes

carry the bucket and mix
the stuff for me.” For
this kind of insubordins-
tion he was lashed most
unmercifully, and no man
living or dead probably
has ever undergone so
many floggings as poor
Mooney had to submit
to. But nothing c uld
ever break his spirit.
Upon one occasion, when
being tried for an offence
by Mr. James Bojd,
Mooney slipped a boot off
and hurled it at the Com-
mandant's head. He was
transported to Botany
Bay in 1838 for a black-
face robbery; was sent
to Van Diemen’s Land,
and, being untameable,
was transferred to that
hell upon earth, Norfolk
Island. He was a most
persistent absconder, and
on obtaining his liberty
wou d at once steal arms
and make for the bush.
On two or three oc-
casions he was sentenced
to be hanged. Upon one
occasion, after he had
been trarsferred to Pott
Arthur, one of the
officers heard him plan-
ning with another pri-
soner to murder the
overseer of the wood-
gang and escape to the
bush. He possessed a
flow of high spirits which
nothing could daunt. His
grim sense of humour
was once shown as fol-
lows:—It was the rule to
muster the men at cer-
tain Intervals lor inspec-
tion by the Commandant,
and on such occasions
the mei’s trousers weie
rolled up to the knees
in order that it might be
seen that their legs were
clean. One day Mooney
purposely rubbed one ot
bis legs with dirt, wbloh
was at once noticed by
the lynx-eyed inspector.
“ How do you account
for your leg being in that
state, sir ? ’ Mooney
looked at his interrogator
with a twinkle in bis eye
and then looked down at
his leg with a puzz’ei ex-
pression. “1 must have
made a mistake,” be said!
“ d dif I didn’t wash
my mate’s leg instead cl
my own.” He was let off
that time, but the record
of his many punishments

Curious coincidences occur outside of all
noflflibillties to be calculated by actuaries. B very-
nne knows that George Eliot’s real name was
Mary Ann Evans, and that she made a left-handed
marriage of 14 years’ duration, with Mr. G. H.
Lewes. In the lately published letters of Lord
BeaconsSeld to his sister we read that his wife’s
maiden name was also Mary Ann Evans, and
that her first husband's name was Lewes. In a
late affiliation case in Melbourne a Miss Burns
summoned one Quinlivan for child keep. But
three years ago these names—not these persons—
were before the Courts In a murder case. One
Burns, a railway labourer, was found guilty of the
death of a former mate of his of the similarly un-
usual name of Quinlivan.
Joseph Arch, the English agricultural
labourers’ representative, caused some sensation
the other day by taking his seat as a member of
the House of Commons, dressed in a rough grey
tweed jacket and billycock hat. This is a lesson
for the Australian Democracy. The experience so
far of the electors both of N.S.W. and Vic. goes
to show that the man who leaves the forge or the
bench to enter Parliament as a labour representa-
tive and who changes his clothes “ because he has
a position to keep up,” turns his back upon his
constituents. A shiny black coat is as much an
emblem of aristocracy as the Windsor uniform ;
and the glitter of a shiny black tile on the head of
a “working man’s member” should serve as a
lighthouse to voters against the danger beneath.

One day, fifteen years ago. Marshal

shal, “ under tbe escort of Prussian cavalry, drove

Bumbledom in the graveyard ! The
monument to the late Mrs. Watson, who so heroi-
cally defended herself against the blacks on a
small Island in the Far North some years ago, has
been unveiled at Cooktown. The local Inde-
pendent asks “by whose authority the name of
Edward D’Aroy, Mayor 1886, was out on that
monument ? Mr. D’Arcy was not mayor in 1881,
and the name of the mayor should have been left
plank until the municipal year commenced after
the election in February. We have no objection
to Mr. D’Arcy ’s memory being preserved and
associated with that of Mrs. Watson, but the muni-
cipal committee might have paused before record-
ing. for perhaps 300 years, a falsehood in our local
History.” The Cooktown authorities have ovi-
aently heard of the Soudan medals (issued by the
oydnty Corporation), whereuoon the name of the
mayor was engraved in letters larger than those
denoting the name of the valorous recipient.

lishing a report ot a speech delivered by a returned
immigrant libelling Sir Alexander Stuart, and
upholds the accur ey of the report. Sir Saul
Samuel Has been trying to induce the public pro-
secutor to indict die libeller, but It is probable he
will await the arrival of Sir A. Stuart.” If fair
Alexander Stuart is so stupid as to try and crimin-
ally prosecute a powerful Radical organ-or any
other p*per—like tbe Weekly Dispatch for
exercising the undoubted right ot every British
newspaper to fully report the proceedings at a
public meeting he will be simply laughed out of
the Empire. Aliok will find when he tries to bring
down the Dispatch that he is no longer
in the free and enlightened ex-oonvict colony
of N.S W., living under laws which would dis-
grace the mediaeval Chinese. In England—and
very properly so-all you have to show is
that what you say is true The rest is left to your
own good taste and to the never-failing ultimate
verdict of public opinion and history. The
English pressman ia privileged to report
anything and everything said at a public
meeting; tie Australian journalist, thanks to
the fact that our laws are written and maintained
lathe interests of the “ first families.” still writes
in muzzle and manacles, and metaphorically
clanks under the editorial table the leg-irons
rivetted on him by people on the tombstones
of whose fathers ail reference to the cuiso of
death is purp s-dy omitted We are not a vare of
the nature of the libel com plained of by Sir Alex-
ander Stuart; we can only conclude that this
mendacious rascal of an immigrant has said a nne-
thi; g of a satirical character bonoerning Aliok’s
peisonal appearance.
Paraphrasing a well-known saying of Dr.
Johnsons, wo may remark that in u, narrative of
toe career of certain Australian “lucky miners”
there would be some of tho most sickening chap-
ters In the bis.ory of man. According to a tele-
gram received last we»?k in Sydney, a wire h&d
arrived at Brisbane from Normanton, North
Queensland, staling that Mr, Francis Horace
Stubley (not so very Jong ago a Sydney resident),
formerly a member of tho Queensland Parliament,
and once a wealthy miner, left Normanton last
Thursday week for the newly-discovered Croydon
gold-field with a party of 10. On the following
day the party reached a shanty 65 milts inland,
where Stubley complained of feverishness and
rested six hours. He then mounted his horse but
felt worse and on getting down expired almost
Immediately. Four other deaths occurred on tho
same day on the same road. A doctor has gone
out from Normanton to exhume one body to as-
certain the cause of death. A further telegram
from Normanton to the Colonial Secretary reports
four deaths including Stubley’s, and states that six
other persons found on the road werenot expected
to live. The heat in that region is terrible. Infor-
mation sent to the police particularises the deaths.
The name of the deceased are: John Thomas,
James M’Lean, Thomas Corry, and Prank Stubley.
The place where they died is near Green Creek,
Thus miserably ends the chequered career of
Francis Horace Stubley, who during a few years
took out of one hole alone at Charters Towers,
over a hundred thousand pounds’ worth of gold—
and “knocked it down.” We are under the im-
pression that Stubley was a mative of Victoria;
anyhow, some of his earliest years were spent in
that colony, where in the first days of his manhood
he worked as a blacksmith. By and bye, he came
to the front as a venturesome potato speculator at
Warrnanabool, and soon managed to fail for a con-
siderable amount. He left Melbourne for Eng-
land in a sailing ship, and was not heard of much
again down South until he turned up some years
afterwards in the character of a rich reefer, whose
mines were yielding more money than he could
well count. Like ail the rest of mankind,
Horace Stubley wasn’t satisfied with a good
tning, so he went in for racing and gam-
bling, pail big prices for pedigree stock for
his Kar Northern stations, and—crowning folly
of all-thought he could become a millionaire
through the medium of grain-speculation, a few
years of which, with the aid of his rash ventures
in other directions, deprived him of his splendid
fortune, shot nil mines into the insatiable maw of
the banks, and even landed him in gaol at vj el-
bourne as an insolvent compelled to account for
the expenditure of moneys, some consider-
able portion of which, according to the
evidence, had been exchanged for diamonds
It might have been expected that, after such
terrible reverses following on the expenditure of
his best energies, Stubley would have bent to the
blast and been heard of no more. Not he. With
seemingly dauntless energy he set about endea-
vouring to retrieve his fallen fortunes. He
projected again at Charters Towers, but vainly—
few men find twice in their lives a St. Patrick’s
block or strike mundic in such a mine as the
Bryan O Lynn—few men who have made huge
piles and then lost their all in a place where once
they found themselves without enough money to
buy a cup of coffee (such was Stubley a experi-
ence when first he arrived at the Towers) are
fated to hit again upon the glittering bonanza
The elation felt by Frank Stubley on the morning
when, after many months of toil, the red flag was
hoisted in his claim, and he went over to ask old
Mother (who sat in the doorway of her shanty
mending the Crimean shirt of her “lucky” lodger)
to “ have a drink and wish him more success,”
ultimately proved too much for the man in whom
the love of speculation war a patsion. During the
last year or two Stubley was hard pressed; sheer
desperation probably drove him to follow that
snifty will-o*. the-wisp. Gold, along the arid road
up n <vh cn he an! so many of his part? met, their

Wilson, succeeded In getting a seat at tho first
attempt. Mr. Spansley’s career in Australia is
shortly told, and beyond that there is, at present,
little to tell of him. Ho arrived in Melbourne in
1834, was for a time clerk to the late David Lyons,
the stock broker there, and also Melbourne corres-
pondent for the Ballarat Star. Afterwards he
started, in conjunction with Mr. Martin (now of
the Colonial Mutual Assurance Society), the Prah-
ran and St Kilda Advertiser —a paper still
extant. Entered himself in 1860 at the Melbourne
University as a law-student and was called to the
Victorian Bar in April, 1864. Went then to Woods-
point to practise for two years. On his return to
Melbourne, he took serious views of life, married
Miss Staughton, eldest daughter of Mr, Simon
MR. HOWARD SPENSLEY, M P.
Staughton, a wealthy squatter, and struck out
for both fame and fortune Got returned to Par-
liament for Portland, and was made Solicitor-
General in Sir Gavan Duffy s Ministry. Mean-
while found that the trustees of his late father-in-
law’s estate had a half-acre allotment in Bourke-
Brreet,8 r reet, Melbourne, bringing in a rents! of
£650 only. Offered to put £3O 000 worth of
buildings on it if a 20 years’ lea e was given to
him Obtained the lease, and built the Koyal
Arcade as it now appears Finding that a clear
income of £5OOO a year accrued therefrom, after
payment ot ground-rent and taxes, Mr. Spensley
retired to England on the burst up of the Duffy
administration, and entered as a law student of
Middle Temple, Hs was called to the English bar
in 1874, and has been resident, since that time, in
London, save for a short visit paid to Australia in
1878. Mr. Spensley is a thorough Liberal—if not
Radical—ln politics, and votes for all the move-
ments brought forward by his party. As a bar-
rister of now 11 years’ standing, he is eligible for
any of the legal positions falling to the gift of the
dominant political party for the time being,
Duncan Gillies, the new Victorian Pre-
mier, has got a pretty good start from a democratic
point of view. During the recent election a hand-

betical Conant) flew round very extersively in-

H Derangement of fths Liver
THE CAUSE OF DISEASE
IN THE
STOMACH,
KIDNEYS
—AND—
S"SrSTB^£.
Below will be found a brief summary of a Lecture upon the layer, delivered before
the Electric College of Medicine, by
DB. J. EATDOCS,
The Liver has been known as the great blood-maker and blood-purifier of the Circulation. From
its size and spongy structure, it plays a most important part In the animal economy, as regards
assimilation and nutrition. Food taken in the mouth and acted upon by the digestive organs of the
stomach is converted into Gilucose and Peptone, and in these forms enters the Portal vein. Here, by
the action of the liver, these substances are converted into a form of sugar and pass out of the fiver
by a large vein, called the Hepatic vein, into the general circulation. '1 he aew material now formed
serves two purposes, viz ; the maintenance of heat in the body and assisting in the cell growth of the
system.
Dr. Murchison says, “ The composition of bile and its secretion is very complex. It is constantly
being secreted by the liver, and, increasing suddenly before eating, gradually decreases as soon as the
appetite is satisfied and feeding ceases.” Now, if this most important organ of the body becomes
torpid, or the passage of bile interfered with, emaciation and disease ensue, I note eight marked
peculiarities that now occur, and which we all know of
1. The patient complains of a feeling of weight and fullness of the stomach,
2. Distension of the bowels by wind.
3. Heartburn.
4. A feeling of weariness, pains in the limbs and great sleepiness after meals.
5. A bad taste in the mouth, especially in the morning, and furred tongue.
6. Constipation, with an occasional attack of diarrhoea.
7. Headache in front of head.
d. Depression of spirits and great melancholy, with lassitude and a disposition to leave
everything for to-morrow.
All of the above symptoms go to show functional derangement of the liver; and new comes the
great importance of any error made as to the condition of the patient. He should immediately pro-
vide himself with a UIVISK STIMULANT, the most common form of which is a Pill. Daily ex-
perience shows that this, when the Pill is conjjjpunded properly, is the readiest mode of inciting and
promoting the action of the Liver, and can bflalmostalways relied on. I have devoted many years of
my life, as many of you now before me know, to compounding a Pill that will act readily and system-
atically as a Bilious Remedy. Ido not believe In gr&st purgatives, and therefore have made a Pill, one
of which is an active and thorough dose. I have called it
Or. Haddock’s Hw Llwsr Pill (Siagai* Oaatad.)
One Fill is a Dose! One Fill is a Dose! One Fill is a Dose!
For all Diseases of the Kidneys, Dr. Haydock’s New Liver Pills are a perfect cure. One Pill
will satisfy the most sceptical.
For Female Diseases, Nervous Prostration, Weakness, General Lassitude, Want of Appetite, an
Sick Headache, Dr. Haydoek’s New Liver Pills will he found an Effectual Remedy.
They are universal in their effects, and a cure can almost always be guaranteed.
Each vial contains Twenty Pills—One Pill is a Dose. Price Twenty-Five Cents.
FOB SALE BY ALL DRUGGISTS.
Every Pill is Sugar Coated. If your druggist does not fceep them, we will mall thera free to any ad-
dress on receipt of 35 cents. Five vials for $l.OO. BUY AT ONCE. DO NOT DELAY.
CAUTION.—To secure the genuine Haydock’s Pills, observe that the signature of J. H. Franco

tic can have a sample bottle sent Mm free on receipt of his name and address.

SfrETY Theatre—“ Uncle Tom s Cabin
*thambba— Minstrelsy, Olio, and Farce ,<
Academy of Music—Minstrelsy ••
“Hoodman Blind” was the treat at the
Sidney Boyal on Saturday night. This was the
flj«t production of the work in and
tne hold it was known to have taken of the
v/?arda in London and New York, anticipations
The house was filled, the audience
The play, written by Jones and Barrett, ex-
S hits world-old passions in new and rustic eos-
£,mes Jack Yeulett, the owner of Green Briddy
TMn, and Nance (his wife), are ideally happy.
T?r/ard and Kridge are land agents, with a mort-
al on the farm. Years before, Nance had re-
nted Lezzard’s hand, and the rejection has
omired and poisoned his nature. While keeping
n° n U a friendly intercourse with the family, he
inrks his partner to foreclose, and works Jack to
Sieve his wife unfaithful. This is the end for
which he schemes. Ostensibly to help, but in the
to ruin him, Nance’s father returns from
abroad and dies mysteriously in Lezzard s house,
baling before his death that he has another
saiiffhter, lost, but alive, between whom and
Nonce his money is to be divided. The money
lizard and his partner appropriate, and the dead
man they pass off as a relative of the former. Out
of this comes the final wreck.
* * *
f Ben ChibblGS, the blacksmith and farrier,
Abbots Creslow, is a well-drawn and interest-
?nir character. He marries Polly on the day the
Snnble begins, succours Nance when an outcast
liondon, returns with her to her native village,
anraforts her with loud but genuine good nature,
and puts Inspector Jermln on to the trail of
r P/zard. He is not passionately fond of his wife,
rum is she of him, but they pull along together
nnmfoitably and prosperously. Ben Chibbles and
hia wife, as pourtrayed by Mr. Appleton and
Miss Marie Brooke, belong in love matters to the
l-biss of common-sense people in whom a grand
Sion is never found. Consequently they live,
and fatten, and die in peace. Mr. Titheradge was,
nn the contrary, the intense, fine-fibred, fervid
Tank Yeulett, to whom his wife was a goddess
fiven though the surroundings were poor. To
him accordingly, came terrors and tragedies.
Pnllv's love for Ben was lethargic. She, too, grew
fat Nance’s love for Jack was wild, consuming;
Teas the waif’s love for Tom Lattiker was homage,
idolatry. Nance was consequently thrown to the
winds with a breaking heart, and Jess was driven
into the Thames with a broken one.
* * *
Love is the twin-sister of Genius. In the
same realm of white sunshine both are born. On
both brows break the same radiance. Each
carries in the right hand the full of a heart of
exaulslte rapture and the full of a head of
ecstatic delight. But each carries in the left hand
a phial, the odour from which makes madness,
and the taste of whose contents incites to murder.
The man who wants to grow fat as he grows grey,
and to have a red-cheeked crowd of children
about his knees, and a smooth-browed wife in a
cloudless home beside him, should pray to the
cods for a union of convenience, and to be hidden
away from the touch of the hand of madness-
making, murder-breeding, ecstatic Love.
• ■ •
The authors appear to have had trouble in
supplying Jack with adequate pretexts for con-
demning his wife. Lezzard, to the development
of whose character Mr. Vincent applies forces
that go with the conception of lago, is made to
bring suspicion to the “ sticking-point ably.
Withal, however, a sense of Inadequacy obtrudes.
Jack’s love turns to hate in one evening. It is
true he is brought near to where a woman like
Nance) sits on a stile with a Gipsy. Jack’s idola-
trous love should have asserted itself in a refusal
to trust his eyes. His hearing had been to a small
extent abused before, but instead of beginning a
fight with the Gipsy, the impulse of his intense
love should have driven him to an encounter with
the women he mistook for his wife. That, how-
ever, would have closed the play. It is not the
natural development of Intense passion, but the
exigencies of authorship that act here. The inci-
dents that turned Othello mad were numerous,
insidious, tortuous, and protracted. The gulf
between him and Desdemona was dug long before
the crowning blow was dealt. Such a course was
necessary, even with a man like Othello, who, as
lago knew, was—
“Of a free and open nature
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.”
Until Jack is brought to the style, however, his
love is untouched. In one instant the whole
change takes place.

The melodrama is exciting, shows a very-
dexterous manipulation of persons and incidents,
abounds with snatches of rural scenery, the
beauty of which the brush of Gordon makes
Striking, and is interspersed with some well-
written passages of pathos and power. Mr.
Titheradge does not possess a strongly sympathetic
voice. There are no tears in it. It is the voice of
a man on ’Change. It’s tones are good for buying
and selling with. The soliloquy at the river, into
which he is about to fling himself, is finely written,
but it does not catch hold. His acting is, of
course, strong, manly, finished, but in this part
his voice is too matter-of-fact to take captive the
light, quivering, variable, sensitive sympathies
that hover around the situation. Miss Maggie
Knight plays the double part of Nance and Jess.
Neither calls for representation of a more than
mo ierate character. She faints, is repulsed by
Tom Lattiker, and throws herself into the Thames.
But though very capable, her performances do not
rise above the medium level. There was an effec-
tive orchestra, and the combination of a multitude
of things, middling and good, will make the play
an attractive one for some time.
** * *
“The Shades of Australia,” by one of the
lights (and not an 80-candle power, either) of the
same continent, is now the business at the Sydney
Opera House. It is said that it was “ written ex-
pressly for this theatre,” which goes to show that
Mr. Southan, the author, has a poor opinion of the
Opera House. The drama has been “ taken from
real life ’’—real life in Mars or Venus, we presume,
for the business is unlike anything we have seen
on this world. That very fact constitutes the
chief attraction of the piece; it makes the repre-
sentation unique, novel, and bizarre.
• • ■
We would fain surround Mr. Southan’s
work with a girdle of glorifloatory gush, a halo of
hyper-laudatory epithet and a crown of congratu-
latory compliment, but the piece is too amateur-
ish as to plot, and too clumsy in the dialogue, to
warrant any extravagant encomium. The third
scene in the first act is, perhaps, the funniest part
of the business. Anastasia (Miss Blanche Lewis) is
seated in a sort of drawing-room in her mansion.
Mark, a stockbroker (Mr. H. N. Douglas) enters
and proposes apparently for about the 30th time,
fhe refuses, and while the footman at her elbow
is arranging the lamp on the table, unravels in the
most ingenuous manner possible some little
womanly sins of her own in former years when
she was led into a mock marriage with a heartless
villain, who left her after the birth of her child,
whereupon she put the said child out to an
amateur baby-farmer under ridiculous conditions.
Mark then departs, and she turns down the lamp
u hh leaves the room. On the table she has left a
light desk, containing valuables, and as the room
das no door, but merely a wide curtained entrance
to a garden, her conduct must be regarded as care-
less in the extreme. Batera a Melbourne pick-
pocket, dressed in very well ventilated garments,
ae sees the plunder, but stops to take some nips
ir°hi his Saak, and spout copy-book platitudes of
tae vice must ever terriumph I” order. He gives
the signal to his pals by whistling at the door, and
they come in and characterise everything as
“ bloomin’,” but show no alarming disposition to
burgle while there are comfortable sofas about on
which they can sit and talk about prayers learnt
at a mother’s knee. They are evidently burglars
of culture, for one of them (Scotty) remarks— I
have a strange presentiment that something is
going to happen, but so far have nothing to verify
my suspicions.” Then the question of collaring
the plunder is discussed, and one incipient Ned
Kelly insists upon their leaving the desk, because
she might value it more than she does the loot,
and while they argue this question. Button, the
detective, who has “put up the job,” comes in
and collars the blood-thirsty young miscreants,
and declares the capture will earn him another
stripe, but Gus. Pearson (J. L. Hall), a Yankee
with a consuming desire to mind other people s
business and borrow £lO notes, emerges from
behind the curtains and denounces, in a style that
brings down the house, the treacherous Button,
who, in the sequel, srets his stripe—3s of them in
fact, and five stretch besides. This robbery all
through is funnier than G. H. Reid’s Exhibition
cantata. If such truculent young ruffians as Mr.
Southan’s trio were to visit our hash-foundry at
Woolloomooloo we wouldn’t trouble to throw
things at them, we would just sool the cat on.
She would wipe them out in one round.
* * *
There are many parts of the play that in-
trigued us considerably. We were, for instance,
at a loss to understand why “ Mercenary, a modern
hotel-keeper,” should have been shot dead in the
second act, unless it be that gore has a distinct
commercial value in colonial dramas; nor are we
quite clear as to the raison d'etre of the shooting-
irons in the gambling scene; nor, in fact, the
necessity of the scene at all. Stray chunks of plot
have a habit of lying around loose in the “Shades,
and are perhaps introduced to nut the Ingenious
auditor off on a wrong scent. With all its incon-
sistencies and incongruities, however, the piece is
admirably received. The evident fact that the
dialogue has been written by an Australian, for
Australians, predisposes the generality to a
favourable verdict. And the scenery assists the
pieco to a very large extent: the representation
of Cole’s Wharf, Melbourne, being so accurate
that a pittite, who borrowed a match from us out-
side, offered to point out Ms boiler if we would
come another night.
* * *
The most interesting and consistent
chapter is that in which James Traveller is con-
cerned, and under Mr. Burford’s treatment the
character becomes an interesting, if somewhat
gruesome study. Traveller and Sinclair (Mr. Rod-
ney, who shines with unwonted luminosity) put
up a job on the guileless sharebroker, and he not
being fly to the game is “ nipped for five stretch;
from first to last this incident is worth attention.
* * *
This time we have only given scraps of
the performance, for we are naturally of a charit-
able disposition. At the fall of the curtain there
were loud calls for the author, but he did not
appear. It was modesty (or absence) that kept
him away. Discretion had nothing whatever to
do with his non-appearance.

At Sydney Gaiety, “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ”
(by Dampler) still provides Ben Jones and Solomon
with cigars, and Gunther with cosmetiques for
his miraculous moustachios. There are four stars
in the constellation which at present lights the
Gaiety. Two of the cluster might with advantage
shoot themselves into the studded realms of space
without being missed to any great extent. Of
course, we do not intend to specify the particular
pair which might emulate the uncertain meteor
in the rapidity of their disappearance.
• • •
Miss Livingstone as Topsy is a marvel. A
marvel as showing the depths to which a pour-
trayer of any character can descend when striving
to be funny. Topsy is nothing if she be not funny.
Miss Livingstone is not funny. She annoys the
audience by her repeated gagging, and in mo-
ments when pathos is supposed to be represented
by the scene before the house, her ill-timed in' er-
jections serve, while awakening some caochina-
tory guffaw in the chest of a seasoned larrikin,
simply to certify that the performance is a
burlesque. 9 * *
The Marks of J. F. Sheridan—Jurispru-
dence Marks—is a clever impersonation, though
differing from Mrs. Stowe’s Marks. He seemed to
rather abjure his prudence and endeavour to dis-
Slay the humour of Sheridan in the person of
larks.

The only Dampier plays the part of George
Harris with distressing [calmness, and evinces so
little anxiety-genuine anxiety—to seek freedom,
that one is reluctantly compelled to imagine his
sole ambition was to get rid of his wife and child
by the fashion of divorce then prevalent, “Sellin
’em ’way down de ribber.” Dampier is not the
fugitive slave—he is Dampier all the time.
* * *
Miss Kemble makes as much business as is
posnble out of the small part of Eliza, but there is
too much discount off the transaction for the
artiste’s abilities to profit from her efforts. As
there is such a tendency to Introduce innovations
into theatrical performances of late, we would
suggest that Eliza’s passage across the sea of ice
be performed on roller-skates, trundling her
juvenile offspring la a wheelbarrow. This would
add greatly to the intense excitement of the run-
away; or, if the two bloodhounds could be
allowed to read the fairy tale of “ Una and the
Lion,” or the Androolea fable, they might induce
the inhuman slave-dealers to skip up a tree by
championing the terrified lady and bearing the
youthful Harris across the ice-floes between them.
♦ * *
We have found out the trick of working
stage bloodhounds, and in its very simplicity lies a
wealth of wonder. When it is necessary to place
them on the scent, the first villain crosses before
them with a shin of beef in his pocket, and the
return journey is induced by passing the joint
quickly round to the back and waving it from the
O.P. side. The hounds, in their eagerness for
supper, dash frantically across where their reward
awaits them. Thus does the human animal come
ahead of the simple canine. “ Uncle Tom's Cabin”
will be pulled down in about a week.

At Sydney Alhambra the first part ren-
dered on Monday evening was arranged in a
symmetrically sequent way, such as would lead
the reader of the programme to infer that the
management was matrimonially inclined. As the
genial Smith who runs the concern has long since
been welded in the bands of wedloek, the sus-
picion could not for a moment be entertained.
But without prejudice we give the bill as written:
—“ Overture ” (by “ him,” of course), “ Good Com-
pany” (they twain, lonely dell, Cupid’s dart; a
year passes), “Little Darling, do you remember ?”
(he), “I speak to you” (Of course he does;
“Pops,” (?) “Ask Papa”), “Wedding Bells”
(hooray), “There’s a light in the window.” (Of
course, the wedding supper—the old man pays.)
“Saidle Ray.” (Why should he not say “Ray?’
She was his ray of sun shine, or daughter shine—
what matter ?) “ A Soldier and a Man.” (Always
the way—a red herring for the bridegroom’s
breakfast) “Just down the lane” (where she
dropped her gloves when they stole from the
madding crowd for five minutes’ fun at the back of
the old washhouse where she first waved her hand
to him through the chink in the slabs.) “ Chinese
Refrain.” (No need for the cabbagee, lettucee,
young 'n’yun wail-eyed Confuoian to call round
there. No Chinese need apply.) “ Little Birds are
Sleeping.” (And why not ?—let the turtle doves
go to roost, and bill and cdo their little love songs
in each other’s willing ears. ’Twill not be so in
the sweet “ buy and buy,” when the bills come in
for things she “ must have.”) “Curttdn.” (Yes.
mosquito curtain, of course, everyone has it.)
Now. if all these items, collated in the simple style
in which they are arranged on the programme, do
not suggest courtship and matrimony, the names
of the vocalists afford proof positive of this in-
tent. To begin; “Will Hugo (she went.)
“ Amy Olive (Amy. O live for me). ‘‘Gardner,”
—(of their little Eden, to he sure.) “Wesley.
(Honest John, of glorious memory, or one of his
disciples to tie the knot.) “ Wedlock, —(No,
Matlock, hut no matter, it means the same, they re
both wed.) “Rowe ’’—(bothin the same boat now,
husband and wife, with many a row, o’er life s
deep river drift or Rowe, to rest, in peace, the turf
below.) And if this is not matrimonially inclined
from start to finish, let us stick the grey goose
quill into the hand of Hymen—we go to drive a
cab.
♦ * *
The second part opened with a triple song
and dance by Misses Nina Tulloch, Hetty
Crouchor, and Olive, and, in this item, for
the first time, we saw three ladies meet
on a common platform and agree—they agreed
among themselves, with the orchestra and with the
public. And so is dispelled the illusion that there
is no unanimity between women. Is no illusion to
be left us—is nothing true but the gas-meter?
And, let us ask another question— apropos of Miss
Nina Tulloch’s item, “The Swell of the Day.”
How is it that women dressed as men are generally
charming enough to captivate even their own sex,
while men, clad in the apparel of the last work of
God, succeed only in holding themselves up to the
ridicule of their own and the mirth of the opposite
sex? We do not know. Once, years, long years
ago, when life was a golden cloud with a laughing
lining, we put up a joke on a new chum. Sent him a
note, covering a lock of golden hair, asking him
to meet his unknown admirer at 9 p.m. Some of
the boys were let into the secret and rolled up to
see the fun We donned feminine apparel and met
him. The boys saw the fun; we saw nothing after
the first blow. Lor’ what a left he had: he was lift.
3in., and weighed 3131 b. We have since adhered
closely to the divided garment.

At Sydney Academy, Hiscooks’ Federal
Minstrels, under the management of the urbane
Smythe, still attract good houses, or, perhaps, it
would be more strictly true to say, good people
and many of them. We did not notice any houses
present, but the other papers say it that way
and sometimes we fall into the same error. Space
permits not a detailed notice of the capital bill-
capital even for Hiscocks’—but we are bound at
least to say that “ The Carington Craze,” a song
written by Lance Lenton, and excellently sung by
Bent, took the fancy of the house, though the S.M
Herald young man, and some other dismal
authorities, “ can see nothing in it.” Why should
they ? there may be a C.M.G.-ship fall some day
into the ranks of the rule-and-stick people. After
Henniker’s expected knighthood, what may not
happen ? The Herald says the song is merely a
parody of Rickards’popular song, “Harry,” and
the clever young actor who composed it claims
no more than this. But he does claim that, in a
democratic country, such as ours, the disgusting
servility and beastly toadying everywhere
apparent since the arrival’of the, perhaps, rather
too genial gentleman who now governs N-S.W.
must-or ought to be—as hateful and ridiculous
to him as it is, or should be, to every one of the
free and independent. [Query: Are there now
any free and independent?] The item suggests
the possibility of a suspension of the worship of
the one true Deity in favour of our local lord.

Dunbar was in rare voice, and when we
saw his name opposite “Sally Horner” we imme-
diately thought of little Jack Horner, the Christ-
mas pie, the thumb, the plum, and so on. Crushed
again. The ditty was sentimental, though lively,
and as the off-side point of the vocalist’s moustache
aimed always to the O.P. side of the house, and a
fair little maiden on that hand was reading her
programme upside down all the time, and, as Dun-
bar was (Well ? Ed. B.)—OhI nothing. Keenan
and Moynham’s alliteratlvely titled “Kransy Ko-
loured;Koons ” held the item of the evening, a
glove fight between “Jimmy the Pigeon” and
“ Sam the Slogger.” As each man was killed in
the fourth round, it is fair to presume the wager
will not be delivered until the resurrection. War-
ner’s specialities, like a healthy vaccination, took
well (this is also new', and “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,
re-painted by Lance Lenton, followed.
♦ * *
“ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” has been re-painted
so many times lately that the dwelling of the
original U.T. has adopted a coat of Brunswick
black out of respect to its own memory. Legree, the
man-eating slave-smasher, is in this edition an
asthmatic man with the hand of a lady, and the
muscle of a spring chicken, who gets badly
knocked out on each occasion of his making any
aggressive remark to Uncle Tom. Little Eva is
concealed In a summer costume beneath the 73
inches of W. Ball. Amery is the little Harry
whom Eliza vainly tries to carry away to a place
of refuge, but overcomes the difficulties by wheel-
ing him along in a barrow; the bloodhounds are
swapped away for a pet poodle of Sam Keenan s
just about big enough to clean a lamp-glass with;
and instead of the murder of Uncle Tom and the
ascension of the old blackfellow to the realms of
glory the “ tableaux ” picture, “ Lord Carington
welcoming .the immigrants,” a difference at pre-
sent apparently without much distinction. Other-
wise, the plot of "Uncle Tom’s Cabin” is rigidly
adhered to.

The Masonic Hal,l Sydney, is taken for a
benefit to Mons. Leon Caron, on Friday, the 19th
March. The names of the intending performers
are good enough to bring busbies from the blaz-
ing Barcoo or meandering Murrumbidgee for the
pleasure of one night only, so the result should be
a salve to heal the wounds which the popular con-
duotor received during the time he engineered
the, to him, disastrous Olympic. Further par-
ticulars next week.

“Boccaccio,” at the Melbourne Opera
House, was inaugurated with “popular prices.
The experiment is well advised, for the manage-
ment here has an uphill battle to fight
such a fashionable novelty as the “ Mikado. Ihe
troubles inseparable from feminine imanagemest
all the world over, which resulted in the sudden
disappearance of Miss Lottie Montal and tier nus-
band from the scene, have certainly not weakened
the prospects of the Opera House company.
“Boccaccio” goes in vastly better style than its
predecessor. “Madame L’Archiduc.’ No. one
character monopolises all the fat, but the
music and business is liberally distributed round.
Miss Annette Ivanova appears as the persecuted
student in this revival, and works with unflagging
spirit. Her figure and bearing are well adapted to
the character, and there is a refreshing absence of
effort about her singing. Fianietta is now played
by Miss Minnie Fischer, who has only recently re-
turned from India and Emilie Melville. India s
loss is Australia’s gain. This Fiametta is a shape y,
stately young lady, singing, talking, and generally
behaving herself with a coyness and refinement ot
manner intoxicating to all the y oung men under
60 in the solo, “ Oh, love,” and the billets-doux
trio in the second act. Mias Fischer was especially ]
dainty. Miss Ethel Harcourt, who appears as the
cooper’s wife, has leaped into leading parts. She
was a mere page without a title in the first repre-
sentations or “ Madame L’Archiduc.” Now she is
a whole volume in herself, and most beauti-
fully bound, to be sure. Miss Ethel is young,
good looking and vivacious. Her voice is pleasant,
and with a little more training and stage experi-
ence the new star will take the shine out of some
of the older ones. Elderly new enums will take a
tender interest in Miss Harcourt for reminding
them— although she is rather taller—of Nellie
Power in her earlier days. Mr. Appleby is popu-
lar as ever in his rather over elaborated rendering
of Lambertuocio; and Messrs. Kelly and I eroy
Shannon are satisfactory as Cooper and Barber

Hemry Ward Beecher says—“ There is
many a horse more deserving of immortality than
tlm man who owns it. Why shouldn’t they have a
chance hereafter ? I don’t know but what they
will. That is something I don’t know anything
about.”
We do not know that such things may not be—
That dog, or horse, know no eternity,
But this we write, and stamp it with our seal,
There are folks dead who once loved much to
steal,
“ Converted ” they with angels tune the song.
Though even now a horse would “set them
wrong,”
A.nd much we fear if one they got in hand,
They’d fly straight down to hell and heat their
brand,
Would fake a plain TE to bold NB,
And start to riot in Eternity.
So Beech., no horses, in the Promised Land,
Unless each angel registers his brand.

‘‘Old Love. The time lor advertising is
past.” Wo sighed as wo x’ead that cold-blooded
ad. In the Argus. It emanates from a man, we
fear, and what bitter, bitter feminine tears must
it have called forth! We are Indeed sorry for
Poor Old Love.
Ay, past and gone, Old Love, alack’
The human heart Is very fickle;
Though once you might have brought him back,
Old Time, with bis relentless sickle
The early flower of love has mown,
And in its place fresh flowers have grown,
We guess you’re in a pretty pickle.
When first, Old Love, you twain fell out
And he went off, his anger rising.
Now, what on earth were you about ?
To us it redly seems surprising
That you should let him keep away,
And mourn bis absence day by day.
Yet never think of advertising.
“Return, and all may yet be well—
I do repeat me of my folly; ”
That might have fetched your errant swell,
And you had still been blithe and jolly;
But oh I you let the chance go by,
And now you sit at home and sigh,
A martyr meek to melancholy.
“ 3 he time for advertising’s past
Ead words, so very cold and chilling!
And has it come to this at last—
Your Barkiss is no longer willing ?
The moral learn, ’tis very plain—
When next you love and lese again,
Put In an ad.; it’s worth a shilling.

A Melbourne gentleman writes to the
Hebald in sad distress. He says that numbers of
young men and girls assemble at the corners of
certain streets and use language, which is “at
times ” offensive—“ especially to respectable peo-
ple attending the churches in the neighbourhood.”
This must be put a stop to. The It P. who attend
churches must be specially guarded from con-
tamination. Museums, libraries, and pubs, have
been closed on Sundays out of respect for their
feelings, and the loud mirth of the larrikins cught
to be shut up also. But let us try a little mild ex-
postulation flrst.—
Misguided young fellows, take warning ;
Misguided young maidens, take heed ;
You must not stand about in the morning
(Nor yet in the evening, indeed)
At of-rners, on Sundays, expressing
ids as qui.e unfit for a Turk—
V nlgur war’s are so very distressing
To people attending the kirk.
Your conduct don’t matter in cases
Of p'BS c TB-br taking a wa'k—
The colour won’t fly from their faces
Through error from bearing you talk;
But when ih* church clock in the steeple
Strikes one, try to copy the smirk
And behave In all ways, like the people
You Eoe coming out of the kirk.
Now bear this In mind and dissembla
(Like villains you see at the p’a:).
Ye young men and in fids who ts:emble
At corners, on Sundays, we pray.
Abstain from remarks rough aid ribald,
Which danger might p.obably work
To people, black-coated and bibled,
Who’d hear ’em-ieiurning from chutch,
It would settra, now, some doubtiras arisen
as to which of Lord Cariagton’s aides will be the
next contributor to the evening Lcixo, a little
HUMPH!
Did His Royal Highness mean it, did he really lind
it good—
That sample glass of claret which Sir Cunliffe
Owen stood ?
Was it clean upon the palate, of a llavour full and
pure ?
We’ve read and read that telegram, and still we
are not sure.
It doesn’t say that Bertie took his cheque-book la
his hand
And gave a special order for some very special
brand;
Although he called ’em excellent, ’tis on the cards,
we think,
That a very close observer might have twigged a
royal wink.
We’ve tried those hocks and clarets, and pro-
nounced ’em “ very nice,”
But ’tis worthy to be noted that we didn’t do it
twice;
And much we fear that Bertie, too, will faithful
still remain
To hoeks produced in Germany and sherries
sent from Spain.
He may take the glass they otter him, and hold it
to the light—
Discuss its splendid qualities, and—put it out of
sight;
But if he really likes it, why, in wonderment, we
ask,
Does the telegram not mention that our Bertie
bought a cask ?
A SYDNEY NIHILIST.
They found him in a boiler laid,
A scamp of little note,
But yet his ncso a solo play’d
Would scire a Pyrmont goat.
His lightest breath exhaled stale beer
Loafed at the “ Rose and Crown,”
A star—the midnight sky was clear—
Winked through the manhole down.
A smell stole from a neighboring sewer
So pungent, full, and thick
That on its bosom, lightly borne
Bobbed up r.nd down a brick.
The wharf-rats in their gambols frisked
Among his clothes and hair
Through labyrinths and mases where
B ich hole was thoroughfare.
Beneath, the tide the wharf-piles laved,
A ship’s bell rang hard-by;
The morning breeze her cordage waved
And crooned his lullaby.
They shook him up, and “ through him ” went,
Bound nought to criminate,
Except the glazed crust of a pie
Cribbed from some hash-house plate.
’Xwas hard as adamant, next eve
Each rat by it befooled
Slunk up the drain to Wynyai’d-square
To have its molars puded.
The tramp was ta’en before the beak,
Of six months’ ears was rid,
fieemse destructive things were found
Wiihin hi* clothing hid.

The man who wrote and said he’d shoot
the Prince of Wales unless the Prince sent him
£SOO, has got seven years. The Prince, said the
Judge, wished the prisoner to receive a light sen-
tence, but he (Mr. Justice Denman) couldn’t take
that view of it at all; and Mr. John Magee was
accordingly treated to the little dose we have
chronicled, ISo cne who baa read the case could
have the slightest sympathy with Magee. Ho is
aboutthe sickest criminalour attention has lighted
on since it was directed to the intrepid desperado
who robbed the hank be belonged to in v clbourne
by night, only to have the pleasure of digging up
ihe plunder for the detectives in the morning.
There is something im xpretsibly ludicrous in his
thinking the Prince was actually “fooling" him
with a bag of farthings, and his second letter
developesthe possession on his part of an intellect
even below the average of a Carcoar member-
Our business, however, with Magee and his
*' missis ”Is this: She will, of course, never cease
petitioning the Prince for her husband’s release,
and in the result a par. will go the round of the
London papers to this (fleet:—
“The Convict Magee.
“ It has been officially notified that John Magee,
who was sentenced by Judge Denman to a long
term of imprisonment for threatening His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales, some few months
back, Is shortly to be released, his health having
completely broken down under the severe regimen
of Portland. Being much Impressed with the
penitence expressed In the letters of the prisoner
after his conviction, it is understood that H.R.H.
lias graciously undertaken to provide the man and
bis wife with a complete outfit, and to pay their
passages tu Australia,"
So. as a matter of fact, Magee may almost be
exp ’cted here any time. On his arrival ws shall do
our best to place our readers in the position of

these sort of fellows—being protdgds of royalty—
are, in a general way, confoundedly particular as
to whom they associate with.
The growth of “snohisra” in Europe is
artfully encouraged by royalty. Kings and
princes, not to mention queens and princesses,
have began to realise that in middle-class “snob-
ism” is thtir strongest defence against the sneers
and contempt of Democracy. The most fashion-
able mode of caterirg for snobs is by means of
charity bazaars “ under distinguished patronage.”
Such gatherings are the breediEg-grounds-nay,
the very forcing-pits—of what the “hupper-
tuckles” (ermg “Royalty,” and the people pro-
nounce “grovel.” Call the sentiment what you
will, ore thing is certain—that the Highnesses of
Europe (and their representatives in Australia)
are labouring hard to cultivate it. This par.
is suggested by the sickening Intelligence that

WONDERFUL WATCH.
THE CORRECT TIME,
for
THIRTEEN AND SIXPENCE.
One of the chief signs of the progress of the atra
in which we live is the rapid improvement of
machinery, and its tendency to cheapen the re
quire meats of modern life. Fifty years ago for
instance, only a rich man could own a watch, ’and
the majority of mankind were obliged to calculate
the time by the sun’s altitude, the village dial in
tae old churchyard, or a generation further back
by the hour-glass. To-day, however, the import-
ance of time obtains wider recognition—not only
as a convenience r a luxury, but as the absolute
essence of business, and a reliable timekeeper is a
primary requisite alike of the merchant and his
clerk, the employer and the employee, the school-
master and the pupil, the young and the old, the
rich and the poor. A timepiece of some sort is
positively indispensable. Only a jewelled watch
timed to split the seconds is a luxury. A good
serviceable, reliable watch is a necessity—the first
requisite of social and business life—and such a
one is the “ Waterbury,” the cheapest and most
reliable watch in the world. Tne Waterbury is so
cheap that everybody can afford to own one, and
its cheapness arist s from the supreme simplicity
of its construction. Because it is cheap, however
don’t regard it as a toy or children’s watch. It Is
equal in appearance, finish, and accuracy to the
most expensive article, superior in strength and
durability, and will cost less to repair than any
other. The Waterbury is in every respect es-
sentially the watch fcr the mechanic, the clerk
the miner, the bushman, the working man—in a
word the watch for THE PEOPLE—and is within
the reach of all.
“The Waterbury.”

tea
Descriptively the Waterbury is similar in ap-
pearance and size to the Waltham, has a whl' e dial,
bevelled crystal glass, and is keyless, or a stem
winder—no fear of losing the key or leaving it in
some other pocket. As an evidence of the value
and reliability of these splendid watches, we are
now manufacturing over 300,000 yearly, all of
which are regulated and tested before leaving the
factory.
The WATERBURY WATCH, packsd in satin-
lined case, can now be obtained through any store-
keeper, price THIRTEEN SHILLINGS and SIX-
Pi'.NCE. Do not be gulled by spurious advertise-
ments requiring you to send your money ten
thousand miles away, and wait six months for the
return; or pay exorbitant prices and rates of in-
terest for ordinary watches on the time payment
or club principle. Get your storekeeper or
jeweller to obtain one for you, and see what you
are buying before parting with your cash, and
never be persauded by the seller to buy any other
on which ho gets a larger profit. We are manu-
facturing THREE HUNDRED and TEN THOU-
SAND annually, all good timekeepers, handsome,
accurate, and durable.

Having had considerable experience la America,
where Lager is considered the national drink, I
have found Clausen’s Champagne Lager Beer
superior to every other brand. I have had it on
sale here ever since its introduction, and am
pleased to state that it has given unqualified satis-
faction to my patrons, all of whom speak of it in
the highest terms, and prefer it to every other for
its brightness, flavour, and purity. From a trade
point of view, 1 have never had a single breakage
to complain of, or a bottle in bad conditloa. and
can honestly recommend It ts a perfect Lager in
every respect. It is entirely free from sediment
and waste, and is undoubtedly the loading brand
in the market, and in my opinion will long remain
so.

respectively. But to tell the truth, some of the
old-fashioned fooling: of the masculines in “ Boc-
caccio ” is rather too aerobatic to please audiences
that have been educated up to Gilbertian humour.
A little migrht be judiciously pruned away from
the first act. Mr. Albert Brennir is very fairly
Rood as the Prince, but a Mr. Edward Allen con-
trives to be rather obtr sive as Leonetta. He
sing's well enough, but for talking purposes his
tones require moderating and modulating. Unin-
tentionally he vulgarises his character and destroys
the harmony of the scene now and again. The
dancing and posing of the Duvalll sisters lend a
tender interest to the third act, and bring a good
many opera glasses into request. There appear,
too, to be bonds of sympathy between male fre-
quenters of the circle and lady members of the
chorus. An entente cordiale of this description is
laden with promise for the management. There
is money in it.
** * *
Melbourne has gone stark, staring mad
over “ The Mikado.” The management disdains
such hysterical ads. as “ Triumph complete,”
“Superb mounting,” “ Everything redemanded,”
&c., but is content to mention that seats may be
secured “ Four weeks in advance. ’ ’Tisa wide
marg’n to allow for enthusiasm, but exceptional
events must be met by exceptional measures. And
as it is generally understood that any circle seat-
holder dying before the appointed day comes
jound will have his money returned at the door,
the public are putting down their i ieces in confi-
dence and the booking is “unprecedented.” With
one exception, the leading characters are played
by the Sydney originals, and a smooth perform-
ance was guaranteed from the outset—
The Nanki Poo
Alone is new;
’Twas formerly played by Boyle,
But Harrison,
He carries on
As Poo at the Melbourne Royal.
Reduced to dull prose, this means that Mr. Boyle
“took ill” at the last moment and Mr. Harrison
took well as hii substitute. Not too well-
cut just well enough. Criticism at the old
nands would bj superfluous. That the or-
chestra—with Mr. Alfred Celller in the chair—
is all that it should be, goes without the saying.
The triumvirate must be indeed happy. They
have a bill which they can always renew, and the
public will always accept. No wonder that Mr.
Williamson, as he watches the nightly struggle at
the pigeon-holes, murmurs gently, “ How well I
play my card 0.”
** * «
Mr, Anson made his first appearance before
a Melbourne audience lu “Forbidden Fruit,” at
the Bijou. This is described as Dion Boucieault’s
larcical comedy, but like a good many of Dion’s
"originalities,” it is probably adapted from the
French. A particularly unsubstantial trifle is
“ Forbidden Fruit.” Zulu, the Flying Fairy of the
Traptza. is consumed ny a mad longing to attain a
tree ad. by appearing as a witness in the "Brighton
Scandal Case.” In order to attain her giddy end
the Fairy, attired in a crimson plush mantle and an
exuberant “ improver,” culls upon Mr. Cato Dove,
junior counsel (the bill plurallses him into council
—but, no matter), to Sergeant Buster, who Is lead-
ing on one side or the other. All tbe trouble of
the comedy results from this visit. The youthful
Cato bad been a model husband until the lair Zulu
1 lunched an assegai in his susceptible heart. Bus-
ter, on the other hand, is not a model husband, and
at bis instigation a Cremorce Gardens supper
party is arranged. Cato invites Zulu, and Buster
sends one of his little notes to her "lady friend.’
The test may be surmised. The gentlemen en-
counter the usual comedy difliculties with their
wives, and finally Cato is landed at Cremorne
alone. Of course his wife comes and occupies the
next room with her mlJita>y brother. The
wretched man has never previously seen the
brother, and he suffers that mental torture-when
he sees his wifey pifey kiss the martial stranger—
which many married men would suffer and many
would not. D.sgulsed behind a falsa nose and an
apron, he waits upon the apparently guilty pair.
His identity is discovered, explanations ensue, and
everything is ending blissfully, when Zulu turns
up—all appetite and smiles—for her little supper.
The Buster arrives, followed by his not unnatur-
ally suspicious spouse. At this supreme moment
the military experience of Mrs. Cato's brother
prov< 8 invaluable. He explains—naughty boyl
that he invited Zulu. That damsel, apparently
approving of the Captam’s appearance, accepts
the situation; husbands and wives axe reconciled,
and the curtain falls. How Zulu and her new
admirer enjoy one another’s society is left to our
imagination.
« » e
Mr. Anson made an excellent impression
as Buster, a character evidently intended as a cari-
cature of that other, Sergeant B„ who appeared
for the “ Claimant ” in his civil suit. Costume,
face, voice, manner, bespoke the man gro -vn grey
in devoted service of the sex. No comedian of
the day can All the stage as Mr. Anson does. But
he is something more than a comedian His
original Scum Goodman, in “ Clancarty,” froze our
very marrow in the happy days, long departed—
when wo had a marrow. To Mr. Brough, as Cato
Dove, falls most of the work Mr. Brough is an
experienced exponent of virtue led astray, and he
is ever popular. At times, however, his humour
is rather forced, and he scarcely loses himself in
this character. Mr. Frank Cates makes a moat ac-
ceptable Captain Derringer, both his style and
appearance have acquired robustness of late, with
eminently satisfactory results Miss Jenny Watt-
Tanner is imposing as the long suffering Mrs. Ser-
geant Buster, and Miss Trevelyan looks like a wife
who might reasonably expect her fellow dove to
be always billing and cooing. But the bar was
ever volatile. Miss Emma Chambers plays the
perilous part of Zulu (alius Zazel) with delightful
daintiness and discretion. Her business is being
shot out of a cannon ©very evening till further
notice, but this performance doesn’t take place ia
view of the audience. ’Tis a pity. “Forbidden
Fruit ’’ requires one or two incidental shows to
give it tone. We timed it to last two hours ifrom
start to finish, inclusive of a couple of exasperat-
ingly long waits. Such scant dramatic fare will
never fIU a theatre.

TJie Melbourne Opera House is filling
well at “ popular prices.” This reduction in fares
is well-advised, for tbe management has an uphill
battle to flight against such a fashionable novelty
as the “ Mikado.” Tne troubles (inseparable
from feminine management all the world over)
which resulted in the disappearance of Madame
Lottie Montal and M, Pouasard from the scene,
have certainly not weakened the prospects of the
Opera House venture “ Boccaccio ” went in
vastly better style than its predecessor “ Madame
L’Archiduc.” Miss Annette Ivanova is smglng
and plaving in quite her best form, and Miss
Minnie Fischer is a valuable addition to the com
pany. Sne made a shapely and stately Fiauetta,

Ethel Harcourt, too, has leaped into leading
parts. She was a mere page without a title
in the first representations of “ Madame L’Archi-
duc.” Now she is a whole volume in her-
self, and most beautifully bound, to be sure.
Miss Ethel Is young, good looking, and vivacious.

The “Sydney Women’s Prayer Union” are

blasphemous use of the Divine name.” It is
only a few months ago that a chimney-sweep at
Yass was sentenced to 30 lashes-he didn’t got the
lot, as he tainted and had to be.ont down at the

do these fervent females want—the rack, the

proposal is in the air a woman will mostly be
found promoting It. Eugenie carried the war
resolution, and then started off to beg little dainty

Read this. “A respectable-looking man
named Georgs Bcscobel was brought up at the
Simpson (N.S.W.; Police Court charged with being
of unsound mind. A p cket-book found on him
contained a bank deposit receipt for nearly £3OOO,
besides notes, gold and silver to the emoutt of
about £300.” In the mors Ug, half-an-hour before
the court opened, 1500 of George s relations were
waiting outside toe court house ready to take
charge of the lunatic and the “loot.” Tne patient,
however, having completely recovered during the
night, appeared in such a condition of solemn
sanity after breakfast that the inspector had him
discharged in the magistrate's private room, and,
poking him out by tne back door, bade him flee
for his life. The relations gravely sat out the
court house p ooee iiqg in expectation of subse-
quently sacking their poor demented klnsma- ;
and it was only when they found themselves
foiled that the trouolel condition of their feelings
was properly revealed. Poch a roar went up as
has not been heard in Simpsm sines Teece
threatened to resign; and it was many hours be-
fore the city could be reduced to its normal condi-
tion of quictuoe and order. Kelatives on horse-
back and on foot be/ng out scouring the neigh-
bourhood, the capture of the lunatic was regarded
by some as Imminent; but a number of the
relatives are not without a dark suspicion that
George is still detained a captive in the lock-up,
and that the constabulary are squandering his
wealth in consultation tickets and pewter watches.
One i elation offered a distinct compromise to the
P.M, in writing, and in these terms:—“ime is
hunkel you can have the boddy—’and me bout

The pious “ Strong ” squabble—during
which Melbourne Presbyterians have wept, raved,
and alas! sworn-has produced some deplorable
results. We thought we had done with the Soots’
Church congregration and their mueh-mii- yrisad
pastor, but no—the worst has yet to be told. De-
prived, |by a bigoted presbytery, of the spiritual
ministrations of the Kev. Charles Strong and his
lieutenant, Mr. Duds, the Scots’ Church flock ap-
pear to have got into a bad, bad way. A certain
Mr. Dick pain s a gloomy picture of the present
condition of affaiis “ Members of the congrega-
tion,” says Mr. D., “now find that their sons and
daughters do not earn to go to the Scots’ Churcc,
and one lady told him that her little son sMd,
‘ Mother, why are we not so religious as we once
were?'” Now, here s a pretty how-d’ye-do I
Whole Christian familiescrquetttng with damna-

doctor isn’t allowed to prescribe for them. But
even the plaintive query of that little boy dis-
tresses ui lesi than the news that “In another
family a daughter, who formerly attended the
Scots’ Church, had joined some such sect as the
Plymouth Brethren, while the eon now went to
hear Mr. Freethought Symes.” Think of that—it is
the outcome of Presbyterian bickering. The
young man in question became so bewildered sg
to the correct way of serving God that he could
only obtain mental relief from the doctrines of
Mr. Joseph Symes, who c inched the matter by
telling him there was no God at all. The
thing of all has yet to be told The Pov Charles
is having a new church built, to seat 3000 oeople,
and to cost £15,000. It is to be built by a Hebrew
architect—Mr. Nahum Barnet, that well-known

The Rev. George North Ash, of Sydney,
has! been championing the stage as a foice for
good In the land. He denounced the entertain-
ments provided under the patronage of churches
as stale, flat, and unprofl able.! True, |G Kii g.
with but one unimportant excision. They are
“Hat” and “stale” enough, but not unprofitable
—to the churches. Take the bazaar, for instance,
with its pretty maidens, who rusn the unsuspect-
ing stranger to rob him with little rallies which
are never drawn, and art unions which do not
come to a head, and the many other devices to
entrap the unwary fly which enters all too readily
into the net of the bustled and bustling little
human spider. There must be profit somewhere in
this thing, or what beoonoes of the gate-money
and the raffls-plunder ? Take, again, tbe average
church concert Flat enough, isn’t it ? except
just where it should be, iu the music occasionally,
sharp, though at the door where the check-taker
has never any great amount of change, but is
willing to explain that it is just a swindle in the
cause of the church, and drops one’s half-crown
into the box, handing him a two-shilling ticket
with a smile which is more unctuous than a bene-/
diction. Then think, gentle fi lends, of the intellect
tual profit accruing the audience from these latter
festivals. How “ The boy stood on the farm-yard
fence, whence all but he bad fled; the flames
which burnt his father’s barn curied gaily o er his
head. There came a burst of thunder sound—the
boy, where was he gone ? Ask of the winds that
far’around strewed bits of meat and bone, anl
marbles, tops, and little things as scraps of cord
and yarn—the relics of that awful boy who burnt
bis father’s barn.” And the young lady who
warbled “ Put me in my little bed,” and the
audience rose as one man and prayed they would;
aud the hero who wanted them to “ Let him like
a soldier tail,” and whom we have depicted in
another page Ab, ct mrades, we have been there
and have flashed out to buy a little gun and give
him a chanca of going home to glory with a bullet
iu his manly breast. But never again, love, never
again; when next we want pure, unadulterated
wnole-souled, fout-atar enjoyment, we shall go
with Cardinal Moran to the Soudan Encampment,
or some similar place of religious entertainment,
and gaze upon the figure of a maiden with a bronze
penny in her gullet and the fear of the Lord in her
heart, swinging in mid-air to the music of “oweet
spirit, hear my prayer ” Then we shall retire to
our ’bus fully convinced that the trapeze, as a
moral and puysical elevator, runs rods ahead of
the throne of grace, and that Charles Clark, G.

men could do a triple pedestal dance—on nothing

the other a hymeneal artist of no mean celebrity,
and the third and last a rival of Lytton Sothern—

will eventually burn to a white ash—when he is
cremated. A gentle tinkle on the ten-stringed

There had “ bin a barty ” at Mr. Blank’s,
Parramatta, and Adolphus, a clerk in the local
bank, had been “the observed of all observers,” as
bank clerks usually are. He was escorting two ,
buxom lasses home. On the way the trio passed
a large rambling building. Said one of the dam-
sels, “My uncle lives there;” to which Adolphus ,
replied, in his own witty way—" Haw, he s safe in ;
the aw-arms of Morpheus by this time.” The
maiden dropped his arm, faced him, and with
bitter scorn flashing defiantly from her pretty
eyes o’ blue, said in the most freezing maaner,

ponder over rustic ignorance. For the future
Adolphus intends to give mythology a reit.
Snake-virus is very deadly this year. At

of S dney coolly accords the title of “ Doctor ” to
a cheeky Ignorant who got all his medical educa-

arduous nor lucrative task of picking oakum
The calm way in which the N S.W. Pi ess dignifies
as “doctor” every impostor who chooses to as
sume that prefix, reminds one of the Texan sur-
geon who once took a six-hour ride with a Texan
villager, who asked him a great many questions
about the remedies used for certain diseases then
prevailing in that locality. On the following week
h« had occasion to visit a neighbouring village,
where he found his recent companion with his

From a Reuter’s cablegram in the Sydney

the other night, there was a very pretty little row
on the subject of the opening of the library on Sun-
days, and a number of speakers, actuated by the
same liberal and enlightened Ideas as the Trustees
of the Sydney Free Public Library, opposed the
opening, on the ground of the desecration of the
Sabbath by the reading of novels which would en-
sue. A Mr. Bowtell seems to have excited amuse-
ment by referrtngto them (the n v>-l8) *»s “ Yellow-
backs,’’ a pretty conclusive pro- f that dels one < f

subject, thrilling .acid n®, general interest, and in
some pln.e s, more th u Z -Ue-que detail nod r eal-

Political
Points
Ten thousand more British troops ordered
to India. The great fight of our time draws
nearer.
Exactly 200 Liberal candidates who ap-
peared in the Biocord s Black List as In favour of
Church Disestablishment have been elected to
the new British Parliament.
“I do not,” said Sir John Robertson the
other day, “as a rule believe in Governments
where two parties coalesce.”- This Is refreshingly
candid. As he has been in coalition once, and re-
cently has tried to work the dodge again, this
avowal seems to show that the veteran really has
not a very high opinion of himself.
Dan. Mayne said at Bathurst (N.S.W.) that
some members would “ accept a portfolio In the
devil’s camp if only they could stand the climate.”
He need not have made a fanciful statement of
that kind, for It is well-known In Sydney that the
devil is very fully represented in the Assembly,
while “the world and the flesh” have delegates
in the Council.
It is generally understood that Mr. Tom
Slattery (catch him resigning Ii will accord Sorr
Pat a jlneral support. We have a certain authority
for vouching so little on part of his Eminence.
Who shall forget Tom’s defence of his Govern-
ment when he was Minister for J. vice Standard
Paint resigned. Such an ungodly cackling! Tt
sounded like three hens hidden In half an Irish-
man,
An English Conservative orator, after
speaking of Mr. Gladstone’s umbrella, recently
went on:—" But. gentlemen, we, too, have an um
brclla, and when It is unfurled it will speak with
no uncertain sound, and ere long will float in the
eye of day to a sure and speedy victory ?’’ This is
better than the metaphor of our own Trlokett,
the NS W. ex-Postmastcr-General, who was
“hounded down by a sea of obloquy.”

“Mr. L. Heydoa has had so muoh pressure

The American stockowners are combining
for an important move. It is protection In an
emphatic form. They propose to shut foreign
live stock out of the country. Having Improved
their cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses by the aid of
British breeds, the coast farmers now want to
monopolise the business of supplying breeding
stock to inland ranges and ranches. They there-
fore urge the impost of a prohibitory lee on
entries.
The present N.S.W. Parliament does not
command the respect of the Kiama Reporter. It
calls it the worst that was ever assembled in the
colony since the establishment of responsible
government, and puts It generally that " Such an
assemblage of inctpables and of men with soiled
reputati <u* tas seldom been seen before,” It

were only 120,000 paupers—it is reckoned that 700 000

donation would bestow on each starvllng a fresh

Ex-Hon. Richard Richardson, a shining
light in the Orange camp In Victoria, was merci-
lessly satirised at the general election. It will be
remembered that six months ago he had to resign
his position as a J.P. and Executive Councillor in
consequence of a Board of Enquiry having found
that he wrote the signature of one John Carnegie
to an application for some laud at Fish Creek, and
then attested the purported signature in his own
capacity as a J.P. In his electorate—Creswiok—
the political lampooner was busy at work and
placarded the walls with Invitations to the electors
to be sure to give their own names, not “ John
Carnegie’s,” at the polling booths. Richardson
was kicked out.
The kingdom within a kingdom case is
being well illustrated by some of the recent acts
of the Irish National League. According to the
Dublin Express, “various estates have, inde-
pendently of their owners, been sold by the
National League. On receipt of the money from
the purchasers vouchers are Issued, which at the
proper time will enable them to enter upon their
’ properties ’ without further trouble.” Such sales
can be commented on In two ways. In the first
the illegality of the proceedings may be noted.
But in the second, the fact that such proceedings
take place must prove more forcibly than the best
oration of the hottest Irish patriot that the people
are ripening for the boon of complete self-govern-
ment.
An English workman earning 20s. a week
pays Into the Treasury through customs and
excise duties 3s. a week. Assuming, aa the Mel
bourne Age does, that the average of three
children counts for one adult in the matter of
consumption, the workman pays 6s. a week Into
the Treasury. Mr. Glffen, of the Board of Trade
proved not long ago that the taxation of working
men is double that of the rich. But he is far
under, as can be illustrated by the case of the
Duke of Westminster, The Duke’s income is £6OOO
a week. For him to pay 3s out of every pound on
dutiable articles the members of his household
should number 18,000. That Is a clear piece of
arithmetic and proves a clear piece of class legist
lation.
Borne recent utterances of the Rev. J. Alex
Dowie put the new Victorian Parliament In,
shockingly bad light. Dowie, speaking of the elec-
tions, said he had fully considered tne matter, and
prayed over It.” Now, when Dowie prays about
anything it is pretty well understood that the
straight tip ” from on high is invariably forth-
coming. And the " tip ” this time was that every-
one should abstain from voting altogether, as
there wasn’t a candidate worth plumping for.
There are a lot of people who came to the same*
conclusion as Dowie without seeking inspiration
from the skies. We were so thoughtless as to ask
one man “ whom he was for ?” " Who am I for *”
and bis eye made us tremble, “ Who am 1 for 1
I’m agin the whole lot I”
In Ireland, a boycotted landlord lives in a
state of siege. He often cannot buy a loaf within
50 miles. His family take outdoor exercise
armed and guarded by stalwart poiioemen-eveu
young ladies sketching, and picking flowers, are
often thus attended. His pet animals and stock
are poisoned. He cannot get a box of provisions
brought from the railway station. His hay is
made under police protection. One man stands
with the rifle while the other wields tue scythe.
The doctors are, whenever possible, prevented
from attending the wives and families of non-
nationalist farmers or labourers; even the L cal
midwife is deterred by threats from attending
patients. Old men and women of 80 have their
parish allowance stopped because they have
chatted with a neighbour proscribed by the
League.
Mr. Fronde ia no doubt a very able man.
The more able the man, however, the more care*
fm he should be In forming conclusions. When
in VI tons he visited the country house of Sir
William Clarke, and stayed some days on the
estate of the landowner worth £160.000 a year. In
his new book he says:—“l travelled afterwards
through Sir——s property. His tenants spoke
favourably of him, and had no wish to change
their occupancy into ownership. Mr. George and
Socialistic despotism will find no audience in these
colonies.” in the first place, the tenants knew
Mr. Froude was Sir William’s guest. In the
second, their opinion on the respective merits of
ownership and tenancy is, even it it were candidly
divulged, too callow for use in a subject of world-
wide importance. In the third place, the deduc-
tion drawn about Socialism m the Australia of the
future is a monstrous generalisation irom the
solitary particular he had before him.
The Redfern Times does not consider its
member, Mr. T. M. Williamson, a success. The
forensic foghorn, it seems to consider, does not
go down in the House. We, however, incline
to the opinion that this criticism i. uncharitable-
for, it must be remembered that it will take the
cleverest professional man a considerable time to
divest himself of those mannerisms which are fatal
to success in Parliamentary oratory. There were
for Instance, little hopes of that well-known
attorney, Levlen, when he first entered the Legis-
lative arena, and yet now no member, perchance,
is more renowned for the splendid construction of
his sentences, or for the coruscation of wit and
fancy, which forms such a pleasing feature in big
Parliamentary addresses. And yet, at an early
period of his legislative career, Henry came very
nigh getting "busted." Hot from the police

Year. Now, about ourselves. We are quite well,
and that Is about the best news I have to tell, for
times are very hard with us just now. Men s
wages are dropped to 10s. a week, but as Charles
now sees after the horses, he gets lls. Od. a week.
He takes 6d, a week for his club and I take Is for
coal, and then we have the large sum of 10s. to
feed, cloth , and shoe 10 of us, so you can guess
we do not live very luxuriously. Ido notknow
how we are to do, lam sure. I have had Charlie
and Lydia at home from school six weeks for want
of shoes. I have one day’s washing out a week
and that is all lam able to earn till the spring. I
shall be so thankful when the weather gets finer.
My girts and boys are all fat and well, ana Annie
is froinff nurse to the schoolmaster s every after-
noon, she gets 6d. a week and her tea every day,
bo that is a little help.’ This, sir, is the condition
of men and women in Christian England. A
mother of eight children must go out washing to
assist to drag out a miserable existence, whilst
the tithe rent of the parson of the village with a
population of 600 is a sum of between £BOO and
£9OO a year. I intend to get ‘Time-Payment,
printed pamphlet form, and sent home to England
for distribution It is. I think, the most forcibly
written article I have ever read on the subject.—
Respectfully yours, John Bridgman, BUyney,

The Ballarat elections have resulted in the
overthrow of three old veterans, James, Fincham,
and Bell. John James we referred to last week
as a very old member of the Liberal party, and an
out and out Berryite. This time he had had the
offer of portfo io of Mines, and we had hoped the
great mining constituency would have given
him a show of quite another kind to wiod up his
career. James alliance with Gillies has been
made the most of by his opponents. Gillies
formerly worked in the Ballarat mines, and had
the miners’ support, but as soon as he smelt office
he turned dead Conservative, and has remained so
over since. Fincham has represented Ballarat
West for nine or ten years. He tied C. B. Jones,
the memorable dealer with Moses Alexander,
at the last election, and got the seat by
a casting vote. C. B. Jones has beaten him
woefully this time, taki ig second piece to the in-
evitable Major Smith, who in concert With B. J.
Bateman, of the Ballarat Courier, has bossed
tne Liberal party for a dozen years. Bell, the
other defeated candidate, is a nonentity, and never
could be anything else. His successor is R T.
Vale, the bookseller, brother of W. M. K., the bar-
rister, and who has been dying for a seat the last
20 years. R. T. is a man of extensive Inf ormation,
advanced radical views, and great tenacity of pur-
pose. It is to be hoped that the old chap will now
have an opportunity of airing his political learn-
ing in the right place instead of doing so in the
little back sanctum, where he had to put up with
the contradiction of every species of political
sinner. Although the Coalitionists have carried
the elections generally, the number of Indepen-
dents and Oppositionists contains some of the
fiercest fighting men who have trod the Bourke-
street House of Palaver. Col. Smith, Jim Pat-
terson and C. E. Jones can’t exist much longer
without office.
The one great surprise of the Victorian
elections was the defeat of little Mr. Mirams for
Collingwood I’he announcement of the pOII
seemed to be a staggerer for even the free and
independent electors of Collingwo d Flat. His
bitterest opponents never doubted mat his
seat was secure enough, and when the dire result
became known remorse laid hold upon them.
Would the man they had put in his place be able
to speak for four consecutive hours upon a finan-
cial question, wandering adown long labyrinths of
figures where none dare follow him ? Would his
successor have the pluck to challenge a grant to
Sir Henry Loch, boldly stating that none of the
Victorian people knew anything about thfe
Governor, or wanted to know anything about
him? Alas! no. There was but one Mirams, and
the publicans have—politically speaking-slain
him. He and hla historical umbrella have been
wafted out of the parliamentary arena upon the
wind of “ temperance principles.” If Mirams will
hut take to beer he may yet have the Collingwood
larrikins at his feet. At present he is the object of
genuine oommisseratlon. His reverse so crushed
the game little man that, when the dumb-
founded mob roared for a speech, he, for the
first time in his life, failed to come up
to the scratch. But seriously, no Democrat in
Victoria has a better record than the indomitable
little senator. Ten years ago he was elected for
Parliament as a staunch Radical, and he has re-
mained loyal and true to his principles ever
since. We think Mr. Mirams has been infam-
ously treated! byjhis party, who owe so much to
his unceasing labours and advocacy. He was
fighting the battle of liberalism down South when
Chief Secretary Deakln had yet never been
heard or dreamt of, and he was pushing
lor ward Liberal legislation when Premier
Gillies—the man whom Victorian “Liberals”
now promise to maintain in power—was
retarding it in every conceivable way. When
Berry was fighting for the popular cause, Mirams
was his most faithful and energetic henchman,
yet when Berry was forming his second adminis-
tration, he gave a portfolio to Mr. Mirams’ Colling-
wood colleague, G, D. LangrUge, and left the
little man out, although the tatter was an able and
useful man, and Mr. Langridge was a mere pigmy.
Editor Bui/letin. — Sir, — A remark on
Blunt’s (whoever he is) work on India, concerning
the discourtesy of Englishmen to native gentle-
men in India, appeared lately in The Bulletin.
Now, the impression ought not to be allowed to
exist that a decent Hindoo or Mussulman
will dine at mess with the Sahib Log: They, tne
nigs., would not Imerely consider it infra (tig.,
but the first step of the facilis descensus it they sat
down with us. I have been induced to write
you this by reading a critique in the 8. M.
Herald on “New mdia,” by H. J. S Cotton,
part ot which is as follows:—“ Again, ‘mission-
aries have dope their work bravely; but their
failure has been complete. Christianity is abso-
lutely powerless when brought face to face with
Islam. During my 18 years’ experience of Bengal
I do not remember a single instance of the con-
version ot a respectable native gentleman to Chris-
tianity.’” I have apparently had a larger expe-
rience than Mr. Cotton, for I knew one swell (the
Rajah of Kuppoorthulla) who, with his brother,
professed Christianity. They were also Masons.
The former was cautioned to refrain bis step*
from his neighbour’s (our) doorsteps, as we wer®
notoriously immoral: the latter preferred chapai-
pagne to native liquors, and dined at mess antf

The Bachelor Pair.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I was thinking, old fellow.
Just now when you spoke,
Of the many rough years that we ve passed—
Of the time ere the sun of
Prosperity broke
Through our sky with hard luck overcast.
Our sulky and pair are
'1 he best In the street;
We both hob-nob with beauty and rank;
I wonder, old man, were
We ever dead-beat
Slinging clay from the Booligal tank ?
'Twas mighty close work when
We buckled to there
For a tanner a yard at the tip;
But, “ raddle and tar,” the
Infernal old bear,
Had us both pretty well on the hip.
W’ed no money, and could
Neither borrow nor beg—
We were only too glad to “ fall to.”
You mind how old 11 Skinflint ”
Took me for a “ leg.”
And the wink on the quiet gave yon ?
He wasn't a bad old
Sort, until the day
Travelled round to hand over the cheque
And that trouble over.
Our game we could play
With the right bower always on deck.
What was it we made on
That fourteen weeks’ graft ?
Why, confound it all I you ought to know—
I think that, thrown in with*
The “cockatoo’s” shaft,.
About landed us thirty or soj
We look with contempt, in
Our ten-guinea suits.
On what then made us chuckle with pride,
And feel like two lords, though
The soles of our boots
Were lashed to the uppers with hide.
But you were a genius
At saving the blunt, ,
Or at changing the backs of our moles.
For tassels and frk ge on
The knees at the front.
Where the shovel had worn away holes.
But making a damper,
Or boiling a duff,
Was where I used to come to the fore
Why, whafs that ? You think I
Have chattered enough ?
“Well, old man, 1 will chatter no more;
For you, Tom, and I, now
Can never agree— x ,
You don’tsetm those old days to regret,
Perhaos you are right, too,
But hang it, tor me,
I believe I’m a vagabond yet.
This glitter and tinsel.
The “ form ” and fine words,_
Appear somehow to weary my brain,
And I wish, now and then,
That the damper and birds,
And the freedom would all come again.
What, six? Surely not I How
The time has gone round I
Come, man—lay the whip on the pair—
You must have bean dreaming,
Hootl let us make ground,
•Tis to-day that we dine with the Mayor.
J.P.B.
The question of the day in Adelaide is—
“ Who are the nine persons to whom Crooks, the
manager of the “ busted bank,” allowed (without
his directors’ knowledge) overdrafts amounting
In all to iiriO.OOO, The names of the nine, accord-
ing to Mr. Salom, a director, ‘‘would have been
scouted for as many pounds as they had been
trusted for thousands.” We’re ready to wage that
when the names of the nine go up on the board,
every one of them will commence with Eben< zer
or Wesley.
She dumped herself into the harbour,
and on being fished up by a smart young p line-
man, and asked why she took the header she re-
plied, “ Because I want to go heaven.” “Upon
hearing which,” explained the intelligent blue
bottle, “ Oi immajltly took her to the lock-up.”
This was fresher, and better than the Sydney
D.T ’s antiquated yarn of the gentleman con-
nected with the wharf labourers’ strike, who was
told to go to h—ll, and “thereupon,” as he put it,
“ I at once started for the office of Howard Smith
and Co.” These specimens of want of “ appro-
priateness ” are, however, more than paralleled bt
an Incident at last municipal meeting at Penrith,
N.S.W., when Alderman Besley complimented the
local library on a recent purchase of 300 “ beauti-
ful books,” and hoped they would soon be blessed
with more, upon which Alderman T. K. Smith
proudly declared that the good time was beginning
to dawn already, for he had “made applications
for a Hansard, the Government Gazette, and
Oliver’s S cat utesl ’ All the Horary wib rtqulre for
the next thousand years, therefore, will be a
cookery book, a scab inspector’s report, a ready
reckoner, and a copy of Bladen’s “ pomes.”

SUBURBAN TYPES.
THE AMATEUR TENOR.
A N.Z. Bobby, with a conscience as tender
as a boiled chicken, summoned himself lately for
letting hia chimney go on Are, and was sootaply
and promptly fined by the presiding justice.
Robert’s noble example was soon afterwards
followed by a squatter from the wilds of Waita-
rapa. The sheeplst in question had been busy
with his flocks and herds, and quite forgot to
brand —we mean register—the latest addition to
the family circle until the lime for doing so, as
appointed by law, had expired. Then he tore him-
self away from his shearing and hastened to
rectify the little mistake. Oa applying at the
Registrar’s office in Wellington, however, he was
confronted with the difficulty that he could not be
allowed to nut the youngster through the boobs
of the office until he had been fined for bis
neglect. He wanted very much to leave town
by the afternoon train, but it he waited
till a summons was served and h's ca c e
came on in the usual course it would be some days
before he could got away. If he allowed it to be
sent after him into the bush it would be a very ex-
pensive process, and would necessitate another
visit to town In this dilemma he thought of the
bobby, and straightway proceeded to the R.M.
Court, and took out a bit of blue paper against
nimself. Having sworn to the charge before the
“beak,” he got tne clerk of the court to fire it
right at his own bead while he stood shivering in
the dock. Having “ pleaded guilty up to the
knocker,” the “ beak ” fined him the usual
amount, with the usual alternative, and grinned.
The grin was duly reciprocated, the fine paid, the
court adjourned for refreshments and after shout-
ing a bottle of champagne for the Bench, trie
t q natter got away to his wool bales by the after-
noon train. Now we know how to bjuff a hubby next
time we get on a howling tpree. We will swear a >
information against our own personality specially
to suit tue occasion, before the soberest J.P. we
oan rouse up from an after-lunch snooze on a bar
bench, and when a Colonial Robert, swelling with
dreadful importance, comes along to lay his hand
on our shoulder, we will prove to him In black and
blue that the law has already taken cognizance of
our ease, and that her Majesty the Queen— gqhle-
sher-has specially invited us to appear before one
of her representatives on a day and at an hour stated

Personally. Sir Charts Is a flat faced man with a
head greater in breadtn than length. His tele
comes to him from his father, who was proprietor
of the ATHENJEUM weealy review, which Sir
Charles Dilke now owns Old Dilte o talced the
‘•Sir” for his exertions in connection witn the
Crystal Pa’ace Exhibition in I*sl. The son
has helped his fortunes in two marriages.
By his recent one, with the widow of the
late Mark Pattison, he has added £40.000 to the
domestic exchequer, which is, as yet, unburdened
with a family. Like Lord Brougham, he affects a
great fancy for France, In the south of which he
has a show-place of residence. When the world
lately included a notice of him in its gallery of
“Celebrities at Home,” this French house of his
was the one in which he was posed by his inter-
viewer. The late divorce suit In which he was
made a co-respondent was brought by a brother-
in-law of Dilke’e first wife. It implicated Sir
Charles with bis sister-in-law, Mrs. Crawford. The
evidence was that of a lady who had opened a door
without Knocking at it, and who was, of course,
much surprised to find the room occupied. ” Just
as if you didn’t know?” was about tbe only ex-
postulation the inmates might have attempted.
This lady was the one witness who should
have been forthcoming at the trial, but
was prevented “by indisposition.” The result
of the trial was very Irish indeed. The
respondent, Mrs. Crawford, was adjudged guilty,
ana a divorce granted. The evidence was held to
be insufficient against Dilke, and he went tree.
What the people of England want to know is how
can this verdict be brought into consonance with
common sense ? Mrs. Crawford’s admission of
guilt certainly made Sir Charles equally guilty.
Sir Charles had promised his constituency to re-
sign his seat “ it the verdict went against him.
He pr jinised this when be didn’t know two
things The first was that he was onlv to win his
• lection by a majority of less than 300, ai d the
second was that tuings would go as the did at the
divorce trial. "Y u cant, somehow, always
exactly ti-b’ in sucq matters. instead of tailing
back upon his constituency for their support and
succour, he has preferred his election committee
and their opinion, which Is, of course, a friendly
one. It was too dangerous to go through another
election with his late opponent, Mr. Whitmore,
waiting outside for him. Our coming visitor was
to have been Minister for Foreign Affairs in the
newly-formed Ministry of the Grand Old Man.
Many would think that the result of the trial did
not show any incapacity in him for such office, but
he might probably have been joked too much
about it.

Now is the winter of the Counter-skipper ’s
discontent made glorious by the sunny smiles of
his fair cu toners who having encouraged him to

minds us that nothing bores the average husband
more than being compelled to go into a milliner's
shop and stand ss still as a stump while his wife is
wading round in a sea of silks and satins. He’d
much rather stay out on the pathway, and wait-
even if it was half a mile to the next public house.
How different is the case when it is the pa lent
wie who is waiting-while the husband is doing the
shopping. Nothing could ever tempt her to leave
the shop door, especially when her lord and master
(as he is facetiously called by som«) has a penchant

SOCIALS
Quite a crowd collected to witness the
ladies cricket match at Moore Park, last Monday
afternoon, and seemed to enjoy the novel sight
amazingly. But the costumes vill never do. As
long as ladies persist in wearing crinolines and full
long skirts they will ever shine to any great ex-
tent at the game. Besides, they look clumsy, and
the fatigue of running thus overclothed must be
great Indeed. The “ Soroccos,” who wore cardinal
and blue, striped skirts, blue jerseys, and jaunty
little jockey-shaped caps looked a long way more
picturesque than the “ Fernleas,” who had not
preserved the same unity in their attire. It looked
as if the Sydney shops had run out of gold and
black striped cambric, and some had to be satisfied
with stripes of a different hue, and were obliged
to content themselves by wearing gold and black
caps. One—and only one—little lady wore a sensi-
ble dress. The material was deep gold and black
striped, the jacket made blouse-shaped, and
the short skirt hung in loose folds to the
figure, black hose and small cap to match
the dress, Certainly she was a very young
lady, and didn’t mind wearing a short dress.
The fielding was on the whole very good, the bal-
loon skirts proving that at any rate they were
good for stopping the balls, if for nothing else, but
the ladies couldn’t thrown ball even a little bit;
the batting was vigorous but rather “catchy,”
and there were a good many maiden overs—at
least, maidens over—but they picked themselves
up gracefully enough and didn’t seem hurt. They
all went to work as if they meant it, and if they
could only be reasonable about their costumes
there is no reason why they should not ultimately
play a match well enough to make it exciting. It
is rumoured that before the close of the season
they intend tojchallenge the Parliamentary team.
They seem to know where to find a soft thing in
the cricket line,

Herr R. Patek gave a pleasant two hours’
private rehearsal of his band at the Sydney Town
Hall one night last week, which was attended by
two or three hundred invited guests—all lovers of
music, as was plainly evinced by their sitting the
whole performance out. The band numbers about
40 performers, and considering what a short time
it is since Herr Patek took the affair in hand, they
do—well, if not wonders, at all events, remarkably
well. At times they were a bit crude, and didn t
always seem to remember that soft passages should
be played softly, but these faults are only what can
be expected from so young a band. Kowalski's
“The Reservistes” march was given in a spirited
style, and Weber’s “Peter Schmoll” showed
good work, though the oboes were drowned by the
clarionets. Von Suppe's “Forget-me-Not ’’was
much applauded, but as M'Mahon played the cor-
net solo which occurs in the selection, the con-
ductor, in a big-hearted, graceful manner, took no
credit upon himself, but waived all honours over
to the soloist,—who. sooth to say, deserved all he
got. The “Devi’s March” was chosen for a
finale, which was a bright and satisfactory wind-up
of a pleasant evening. It is a nity if the Sydney
public fail to support this band, which gives such
good promise but as Lord Carington has approved
of it and capoed his approval by a yearly contri
bution of £35 it is more than probable that those
who have it in their power will follow his lead.
At all events, it is to be hoped so. Herr Patek is
an energetic and capable conductor, and deserves
every encouragement

Sydney, Wednesday.
Dearest Belle,— We had quite a nice day at
Sydney Association Ground last Thursday, when
the mechanical and literary staffs of the Daily
Telegraph played a cricket match against the
Sydney Bulletin, But I must tell you we went
out quite prepared to see some wretchedly bad
play, for as visions of the Press v. Parliament
match were still fresh in our minds we had no
reason to look for better results this time. How-
ever, on this spscial day these men of letters
seemed to have beat the full force of their mighty
intellects on the game and played astonishingly
well, I assure you. For the nonce the compositors
forgot there was such a thing as type in the world,
the printers were perfectly oblivious of machines
and ink, the engravers made believe they knew
nothing of engraving tools, and—let me see, what
other kind of work is done in a newspaper office?
Oh I to be sure, the scribes—just fancy my nearly
forgetting them! Well, if you had omy seen how
gallantly they fielded and wielded the bat, you
would hardly believe they were anvthing less than
tip-top professional cricketers. Perhaps this is
rather “ tall ” praise, as Ned would say,
but you know we are all apt to be a
little fulsome when we are pleasantly sur-
prised. I mustn’t forget to teli you that
the Daily Telegraph were the victors, and
I believe a return match is to be played very soon.
Just as we were about to leave the ground, a few
lady cricketers put in an appearancs and com-
menced to practise. We were induced to delay
our departure for a few minutes in order to see
how they* shaped” as cricketers, but dear, they
didn’t look a bit graceful in their ordinary walk-
ing dresses, and unless they make up their minds
to adopt a becoming costume, I do not think we
shall, any of us, care to go and see them play a
match. If they could only have seen them-
selves as others saw them, I am sure tney wouldn't
have been so composed. Each time they threw a
ball their skirts would whirl around with the
exertion, in a most ungraceful manner. To our
feminine eyes, at all events, the sight wasn t
pretty, though I don t think the men objected, for,
hungry and tired as they must have been after
their exertions, we couldn’t persuade them to
tear themselves away, when we were ready to go,
so left them gazing in profound admiration on
the clever batswomen. Strange how different their
tastes are to ours I
I was induced by a wretchedly-cooked break-
fast last Friday morning to go and hear what Mrs.
Storey had to say upon cooking in her lecture at
the School of Arts that night—so that, if things
came to the worst in the kitchen department, I
should be able not only to suggest nice dishes
but to actually make them myself. Our present
cook, though good-natured enough, is wonder-
fully incapable; she is so very good-natured, how-
ever, that she actually allowed us to entertain
twice at dinner this week. But for this piece of
unheard-of amiability I heard her fellow-servant
bitterly remonstrating with her, saying that ‘‘that
was just the way girls spoilt places for others by
being so indulgent to their employers.” Now, I
thought to myself, if this cook who wa 3 so willing
to please could really cook, what a treasure she
would be I Well, then, I betook myself and a few
friends to hear the lecture, with the idea of retail-
ing to cookie the information I gained, 1 was
a bit disappointed that only the plainest dishes
were talked about by the clever lecturess upon
this occasion, but as there is a right and a wrong
way of making even an omelette I gained some in-
formation. The hall was crowded ny people of all
ages and classes, and of both sexes, and all the
time Mrs. Storey was lecturing her pupils were
cooking the dishes she brought iatj h.-r discourse,
which were then taken round to tte audience to
be admired and tastei. Some of the articles—
the omelette for one—were rather too much
tasted, for when our turn esme to criti-
cise there was nothing but p'ate left-thia,
I should say, was the very highest proof of the
tootbsomeness of the food, nest ce pas 2 By no
means was the time we spent with Mrs Storey
that night wasted, though, of ourse, she told us
many things we knew before, still l should like to
know how to fix up those hot, spicy, fragrant
French dainties which prove so acceptable to
toe men whose fatigued palates cra?e for some-
thing more than our plain every-day English dishes
Placo before an epicure oae of these plats after

Irritable and bearish, though maybe he has the
grace to be ashamed of himself and tries to make
you believe it is nothing bqt business worries that
cause the frown on his brow and the snappy re-
marks, when all the time the homely sirloin is the
sore point. 80 when Mrs. Storey finds it con-
venient to give a few lessons on French as well aa
English cookery, I, for one, will take care to be
present. Just think of our spending all this
thought and time in order to please those de ir,
troublesome, exacting pieces of humanity— men.
They ought to be very kind to us for it all, and
not too bard on us for our feminine weak-
nesses such aa 5 o’clock tea, and dress-un
prover, &o —indeed, they shouldn't.
Some horrid man has again been denouncing our
tea-drinking propensities-says it injures our
health, cnets a great deal of money, and is a great
waste of time besides. A waste of time, indeed!
Why, we must all have recreation of some soit,
and surely our kettle-drums are harmless enough.
As for the cost of the tea, just let them reckon it
against the same amount of whisky; andaboutits
being bad for the health. I don’t believe it a bit,
at least I don’t want to believe it, and its all the
same in the long run. They may just as wed
leave us alone about the tea drinking, for life
wouldn’t be worth living without our aftern on
social gossip, washed down by the refreshing
beverage, would it ? I wish some one would warn
these anti-tea men that we snail be prepared to
fight them to the death before being convinced of
the barmlulness of tea, so tnat they might save
themselves further trouble about it.
Some of the tales which are floatipg around con-
cerning our Sydney servants are desparatffy iu any
—too funny to believe sometimes; this, fro ever, is
a positive fact. A lady was dressing for the last
Government House reception, but her maid who
was attending her was so surly and inactive that
the mistress gently enquired if anything ailad her.
“ Why, it’s just this, ma’am,” answer?d the in-
jured one; “you have been to the two last recep-
tions and I did think you would give me a holiday
to go to this one; it ain t fair a bit, you missussts
have all the fun to yourselves, and think we ser-
vants can do without.” The girl went to a re-
ception that day, but it wasa r t to Government
House, but to the bosom of her family, her
late mistre s's establishment proving to > smal
tor her after the above episode. And yet anotner
laugh for you: Ohe dom ratios Delonging to a large
establishment being lett in caarge during the tem-
porary absance of the family, determined iney
w mid vary the monotony of their all too easy
lives, and play at being members of the upper leu.
Accordingly the maids had their cards printed,
and coaxed tne coachman to drive them to the
reception. Not averse to a bit of fun, coaohy
complied, and sure enough my ladies of the broom
and the wash-tub went through the formalities of
the reception, and enjoyed thomse.ves so
thoroughly that, when all was over, they could
not keep it to themselves, but allowed the
secret to ooze out. Consequently, they are now
looking for fresh employment. But now Isn’t it
all too funny ?
The proposal to tax bachelors Is really and truly
being carried out in Prance (By the way, I may re-
mark era vassnnt that even the threat of the tax has
seemed to work well here, marriages this season
being nnusally numerous). But they not only tax
the offending man, they actually interdict the
wicked one’s presence at all social gatherings and
narties. They hold that unless a man has to
support mother or sister, no punishment is too
bad for him if he persist in a single life. Of
course there may be obstacles in the way of a man
marrying; in such case he is more to be pitied
than blamed, but if a man can marry and won’t,
he shouldn’t be treated like other men, for he is
either utterly selfish or possesses a heart no
bigger than a gooseberry, and is altogether a
person to be avoided. I can’t quite say I like the
idea of the tax, though. It’s altogether too
humi iating to us to feel that in order to escape
a tax men are content to marry us, whereas
if tbry could have escaped with impunity they
would have done so. Where's the romance of life
when such things must be, and what’s life without
romance ? No, I don’t like the tax business.
Some of the silliest among us are wearing silver
head bangles just now, which are just enlarged
copies of the wrist bangles which were so fashion-
able a while ago Not more than three are worn
round the head at a time. In some cases, when
the face is the right shape, the effect is classical
and rather “fetching;” but a dear little round,
rosy face with a retrousse nose looked rather comi-
cal than otherwise in the Theatre Jtoyal the other
night with her curly round head set in these silver
bands. Girls should really be more careful in
ad ipting new fashions, as in so many cases they
(the fashions) are only suited for a certain kind of
beauty. My Hi tie friend in the theatre the other
night, no doubt, congratulated herself Upon being
among the first to have her head gripped in sliver
bands, but she cruelly burlesqued the style with-
out being in the least aware of it.
And here now I am at the end of my letter with-
ouc a word about the Sydney Liedertafel concert
of last night, and which was just lovely. Can tbe
helped now for I am too tired for another word.

“Can we conceive of any man, animated
by the spirit of David, standing within the vesti-
bule of a theatre ? ’ asked the Rev. Mr. Barnier, of
Sydney, the other day in the course of his tirade
against the immorality of the stage. We must
confess that we cannot conceive of any such
thing happening with the concurrence of a re-
spectable management. After this little jeer, we
proceed to print a story clipped from a Scotch
paper:—“ It was rather profane,” said a well-
meaning old lady to a young cleric, “what you
declared in your sermon the other day about
King David.” “ What was it?” was the natural
inquiry. “Well, after stating that the Psalmist
was a character who would not have been allowed
to come to the communion in any Scotch parish
kirk, you summed up by saying, * I am aware it is
recorded that David was the man after God's own
heart: upon this I have merely to remark that
there is no accounting for tastes.’” The young
cleric, h rror-stricken, hast-ned to reply that he
had never in his life said that, or anything like
that. But the old lady assured him that i?ne hau
heard tde story in many quarters; that it was
quite correct, and generally believed.

William Beach, the sculling champion,
will, on 27th Inst., accompanied by his backer,
John Deeble, depart per Cuzco, to try his luck
over the big puddle. Beach is a man who, by
sheer t luck and gallantry, has won his way to
aquatic fame in spite of the obstacles of compara-
tive poverty and lack cf the encouragement from
outsiders, which has been so willingly accorded
to many aspiring scullers whose almost maiden
efforts caused them to be looked upon as coming
men.” Beach says he will row American oarsmen
only over the Thames championship course, wriled
he deems neutral water, tor any sum from *oUU
a side upwards. He expects to meet Teenier, who
cannot reasonably object to row on the Thames.
Ot Hanlan, he somewhat caustically observes,
that oarsman has apparently forgotten Australian
hospitality and Australian sportsmen. Banian
has not, ne says, written to any of his dear
Australian friends ” since he left the country. Be
thinks Hanlan was at his best when he came nere,
and according to his own statement he
was as fit as hands could make him on the occasion
of his meeting the champion on the Parramatta.
Beach will not row, even if he makes a match
upon his landing, for at least three months after
reaching England, he having wisely decided to
acclimatise himself before staking his hardly-
earned laurels and his backers’ money. He pur-
poses being away a year, during which time he
will meet those who choose to challenge him.
Considering that Neil Matterson is apparently a
better man than any at present pulling on Bogush
waters he does not expect many challenges from
English oarsmen. His opinion was that Matterson
in his race for the championship was at
his best—he had been rowing .five or six
years, at first under the coaching of Mick
Hush, than whom lew better oarsmen were to be
met. Then he was under the care of George x era
and Tommy Kelly, and the chances of his improv-
ing now in skill were remote. Matterson might
gain stamina as he grew older, but judging by his
own match with Neil he considered him as far up
in skill as he could get. In that race Matterson
pulled harder In the first half-mile than Banian
did the second time they met. Of Nelson’s chances
he had hut a poor opinion, and both Perkins and
Largan should beat him. Teemer he thought the
next best man in the world to himself, ana a
straighter man than newspaper reports credited
him with being. The expenses of passage for him-
self and Mr. Heebie to England were to be borne
by Mr. George Hill, as genuine a sportsman as any
in the colony. He would not take any of his boats,
though he thought the Jack Smith about the best
model of a boat a man could wish to see. He
would take home a slide fitted with wheels of his
own invention. He did not purpose rowing in
any sweepstakes except a heavy one, and then
only on condition that no more than two started
in each heat. He purposed returning toDapto
and remaining there as long as possible before his
departure for England. The money collected as a
testimonial to him was invested in the A.S.N. Co ,
and the interest accruing would provide for his
family. The champion, who was born in 1851, will
be 35 years of age on 6th Sept.

on the day of rest, and the seas running high and
looking game for fight, Larry, who has long been
anxious for a shy at something, peeled off ana

Dooley, the coming champion ot Australia, was
soon beside his chief, and uonnors, an athlete of no
badly earned record, joined them. A few moments
were gaily spent in a sport which requires no small
amount of nerve to afford its lover any enjoy-
ment, when, as if to show its power over man, the
ocean sent in its left in the shape ot a huge,
crested, angry wave, which dashed the swimmers
against the cliffs with such violence as to cut Con-
nors severely, bruise and injure Dooley, and leave
Foley with a badly blackened, slightly contused hip.
Foley’s opinion is that his most recent antagonist
is the only one on earth, barring a locomotive,
which could knock the three combatants out In
one round. . *

Sydney sailing men had a great day out
last Saturday when a wholesale north-easter and a
flood tide gave the various cre*s every oppor-
tunity to display their science. In the K.o. Y, C.
Handicap, for the commodores prize, over the
Manly course, the following yachts put In an ap-
pearance :-Waitangi, 31 tons, scratch; Blectifa,2l
toas, Sirocco, 10 tons, Sao, b
tons, 16min.; Assegai, 6 tons. 15mm.; Deris, 5 tons,
35min. The Mamy buoy was rounded by Wal-
iangi. Sirocco, and Blectra in the order named,
but toe yawl took up second running on the road
to Shark island, which was rounded by the Wai-
fcangi. some two minutes ahead of the Blectra,
whmh had Jmln. 7«ec. on the Sirocco. The Wal-
{ai3gri gradually increased her lead and finished the
race 4mm ahead of the Blectra, the Sirocco finished
4min. and a few seconds behind tne Eiectra. The
yawl Eiectra was anything but well handled. Her
forking of the western shore would, no doubt,
have stood her in good stead had the wind
drawn sway to the eastward, but it held steadily
from the north-east, and the Waitangi received full
benefit from hpr working of the eastern shore.
Again, the Electra’s crew were in difficulties with
their square-header almost all the way from
Shark Island to Garden Island, and, taking all the
circumstances ot the contest into consideration,
Mr. may look upon the race as
fairly thrown away.

The unftmsbed races from the Pyrmont

Eenesta finished some 3min. ahead of the Triton,
and the Nereus was behind the Triton, so
the 20-footer takes second place by time allow-
ance Mr. Fred Doran bandied the winner, which
is without doubt a regular •* heeler.” She is about
Bft sln. beam, and 6tt. ,6m. across the tuck, which
makes a regular ship of the 20 footer, but her
wonderful speed shows Ellis made no mistake
when he decided to take copy by tne Yankee flat-
iron The Genesta last week bad a christening
such as a 26-footer is seldom accorded, when
champagne lowed l}ke water, and the talk flew,
nonseauently, fast and furious. Ihe Bebald
credited George Ellis with having said that the
Mssara Cameron might be congratulated upon
owning the two fastest boats of their class in the
harbour. Now, Bills built the two boats in question,
and he is ready to make a statutory declaration no
such words passed his lips, and he is at present
armed with a glub searching Ipr the Herald man.
For the 16-foot dingy race Sophia finished first

which occurred during a bit of •• pointing” be-

Thera «ras a little misunderstanding of
amnn sort ih the athletic circle on Saturday,
whereby between Jaok Hall and the
champion amateur, and Lawson and Fuller did
noisome off at Foley’s Athletic Hall, hut an im-
promptu meeting between Pablo Frank and
Fogarty fully made up for the deficiency in the
programme. Both powerful well-built men, they
made a splendid set-to, for though either of them
with a cleverer man would, perhaps, have been
but a •’ chopping block.” they were so evenly
matched that the contest proved of more than
interest For foyr roimdg they fought so
equally that no decision could be given. Then a
litn and sixth, and it was not till the seventh
fend was complied that Foley told them to
ahako bands, as it was iuipcsobie to decide be-
tween them Fuller and Smith had a hvely four
rounds, the tv'o first in favour of Smith, but con-
dition was not to be denied in the remainder, and
Fuller took a decided lead. Byles then showed
Williams that he is possessed ot a very busy left
fcand; and Foley and Doohy woundup the pro-
ceedlngs. Under Foley’s tuition Dooley is coming
on fast, and although the champion fought too
quickly with his head for his pupil to land his
usually effective left with certainty or frequency,
Dooley showed great improvement in his style,
and in place of his old elbow hitting, he now
throws his body well into the blow. His meeting
with “ Professor ’’ Jaekson has been fixed for next
Saturday week, at Foley's Hall, when a much
closer contest than most people think may be
looked forward to. On Tuesday afternoon a
gentleman from the Bogan tried conclusions with
Foley’s chamnlon amateur. The conclusion
arrived in just three minutes, when, in the last
rally of the first round, the Bogan warrior got the
amateur s left into the place where he puts bis
dinner with such emphasis as led him to suppose
the heavens and earth were coming together So
he sat down to think. Two rounds more were
fought by permission of the amateur, who could
have settled things any time in the second round
This is the second mao from the Bogan who has
tried the champion. Are there no sloggers on the
Barcoo anxious for a shy ?

And this reminds us that some score of
gentlemen assembled in the boxing room at Jack-
son’s Hotel on Saturday night to witness a few
sets-to, the principal being between Jackson’s
favourite light-weight novice (who made such a
gallant fight with Jack Hall some months since)
and a recent arrival from Tasmania. The Sydney
lad held the lead from start to finish, but the
Vandemonian can swing his right to some purpose,
and had one of the loose ones landed on his op-
ponent’s jaw, the Sydneyite might have got more-
’an he bargained for.

Still another athletic entertainment came
off on Saturday night, when several hundred
persona assembled at West’s Academy, Castlereagh-

and tbe principal boxing bouts were between
“Professor ” Jaekson and his pupil, Tom Taylor;
Hall and George Powell, and Lawson and Powell.

Alick Bannerman has come in for a good
round share of abuse for his action in at first re-
lus'ng to allow a substitute for Sparks in the
match Carlton v. Warwick. That Bmnerman
was quite right to object as he did, anyone that
gives the question a taought muff admit. Sparks
was not prevented from playing by any accident,
and, as a matter of faet, was engaged in a
match on the Agricultural Ground for the Junior
Cup. To show how the substitute business can
be “ rigged,” we may mention, as an instance, the
match in which the first Australian eleven played
a dead heat against a combined fifteen in Mel-
bourne, in 1878. In that match the fifteen had two
“stiff ’uns ” in the field, in the persons of old
Gibby and Ned Sheridan-both good batsmen—hut
duff*rs in the field. The skipper of the fifteen
(Coates) got In on Gregory, the eleven skipper, by
persuading him to allow Tennant, who at that
time was about as good a field as they had in Vic-
toria, to field in the first innings lor Gibson, and
in the second for Sneridan, although both men
were on the ground at the time.

Tho concluding day of the Y.R.C. Autumn
Meeting brought aoout more reversals of public
form. Surprises we were going to call them, but
the public have long since given over expressing
surprise at the running of a racehorse. Five to
two on was the price about Malua ior the Cham-
pion race, but he failed to rua into a place, and
Matchlock turned up winner by hslf a length from
Cyclops, First Prince third. Perchance won the
Maiden Stakes from Islander; Ag aos won the
Nursery Handicap from Crossfire; Lesbia appro-
priated the Autumn Handicap; Mudielina won
the All-aged Stakes hy three lengths from Trident;
and Cerise and Blue concluded the meeting by
winning the Free Handicap from Dunlop.

tunate youngster died baiore he could be con-
veyed to the hospital. The ground is too cramped
for the illegitimate business, and it is to be hoped
the Agricultural Ground has seen the last of it.
T. J’ye’s Rosemary carried off the Maiden Trot;

Grand Distance Handicap Trot, Native Cat was
second, six lengths away, and his owner entered a
protest against F. Alexander, the owner and

A merry little turn-up with the mittens
eventuated during the week up the Parramatta
River, when a few amateurs donned the pads
and fought several hot mills to a finish in each
case. The first match was between an English
amateur and a Gladeeville Asylum slogger. Rules:
Queensberry; stakes: askinful. TheGiadesvillian
was leading gamely fa the early part of the fight,
and.lp the first two rounds looked all over a winner.
In the third round the Englishman’s condition
began to tell, and at tbe flnisn the sponge went up,
victory for the amateur. The Text couple to face
the starter were a Sydney Lancer and one of the
“Keepers” at the .asylum. The gentle lunatic-
tamer was a two-handed masher, and from the
word “ go ” made things very lively for the gal-
lant spearman, who, however clever he may be
with a 10-foot sapling a curving knife, is
no great shakes with his “dukes.” His opponent
dashed in his right and left his mark, and subse-
quently slung out his left to right his mark. In
both these caligraphic feats the keeper achieved
his object, after which he knocked the warrior
square across the ring. The soldier’s soul was
troubled and the soldier’s heart was sad. He
retired after desc -ibing the gory massacre as dam
foolishness and altogether unbecoming the dignity
of a wafriOT. Place him oi his fiery and untamed
war horse, letch his trusty sword and his lance ot
iightwoud, and then stand etf and give him
room. He'd present a realistic picture of the
charge of the Light Brigade in exactly six seconds
from the sounding of the spirit-stirring drum.
The next pair to enter the arena were a keeper and
a friend. Tbe keeper could not get his hands into
the mittens, and though he argued he would just
as soon play without them, his opponent declined
the courteous offer and the master of ceremonies
declared the evening’s amusement ended. The
next turn-up will be under the special patronage
of Lord Carington and the local undertaker.
Malua fairly put the seal on his fame by
the style In which he won the Australian Cup.
Robertson lay off until making the last turn for
home, but directly he called upon the great horse
it was p ain that the race was all over—bar the
proverbial shouting. Malua suddenly emerged
from the ruck two hundred yards from home and
settled his opponents, one after another, in most
decisive fashion. Only Cerise and Blue made any
real show of a fight, but toe game little mare was
uutstrldden by the champion, and he romped
home, without having been touched by ths spur,
in the quickest time on record. When it is con-
sidered toat Malua carried 181 b. more than any
previous winner, the performanca may fairly be
described as phenomenal. The victory was a
popular one, for even his unsatisfactory show in
the Newmarket Handicap did not prevent, the
public from having a little on their old idol at
such a tempting price as 10 to 1.

Connors, the champion heavy weight,
took a benefit at West’s Academy, Castlereagh-
street, Sydney, on Saturday night, when a large
bill was rattled through in the presence of a good
assemblage, prominent amongst the crowd of
athletes being W. Beach, who sat the entertain-
ment out. Connors and M’Caflery met in a Lan-
cashire wrestling match, and after an expenditure
of much perspiration and perseverance, the two
falls were credited to Connors Sul/ivan and
Cleary opened the bah with a merry hammer and
tongs four-round fight, without any permanent
injury to either party. Jackson and Taylor
fought three rounds scientifically, though the
black professor baa not made any startling ad-
vancement towards the front. He is not much
better now than when he fought Parnan, A novel
set-to, followed between a deaf and dumb youth
from Newcastle, who refused to tell his name,
and “Murphy of New Zealand” “Murphy of
N.Z.” Is almost as exhaustively explicit as •* Smith
of London.’’ We knew several Italians of that
name on the West Coast. This gentleman is not
any of those Murphies, and for the sake of New
Zealand, we are glad tor this particular Murph.,
who was knocked kite-high by the dumb-bell.
George Powell and Jimmy Lawson fought a battle
which was ► evidently finished before its com-
mencement.' The spar was simply a show fight,
and each man held a bit in reserve. Connors,
who is better on the sawdust than the platform,
deputed Ned Powell to return his thanks to the
audience, after which Jack Hall and Georgs
Powell sparred a very pretty four rounds, both
men fighting pretty well up to concert pitch, and
retiring amidst applause, which, at any other en-
tertainment, would have entitled the performers
to re-appear. Connors cannot be other than
grateful to the athletes who rallied so nobly round
him. He can easily return the compliment by
making a present of a brand new Grseco-Roman
fall.

The Ballarat division dropped a lot of
money over Seahorse, Morven, Britisher, and
others, at the late Y.R.C. meeting, and heaps of

may;iend for a while, but horse owners and public
invariably pay back capital and interest in the
Jong run. By the way, Mr. White’s colours were
not as successful as usual, Philip Augustus losing
a lot of money for the followers of the blue ana
white. Philip is big beyond his years, ana looks
more like a Derby Horse than a two-year-old.

A quiet “ good thing ” was nearly brought
off with Cerise and Blue in the Australian Cup.
The mare is a real little flyer everyone knew, but
few credited her with possessing sufficient stamina
for a two-mile and a-quarter race Gorry, who
had the mount, is one of the smartest light-
weights that ever got into a saddle. If the ooy
goes on as he has begun, there is a capital future
before him.

Subsequent running makes it appear that
a Newmarket Handicap was thrown away with
St. Odille. The style in which this mare bolted off
with the Bourke Handicap at Eiemington last
Thursday was—in the words of the poet a “ cau-
tion.” She had given a taste of her quality in the
Brunswick Stakes on the previous Saturday, hut
the distance was rather beyond her tether. There,
however, she led a good field by four lengths for
more than a mile Over the Newmarket course,
and handicapped according to previous form, St.
Odille might have lowered the colours of William
Tell. The outside nubile wore not long in “ tum-
bling ” to the mare’s excellence, and they backed
her pretty freely for t h« Bourk© Handicap at 10 to
1. As a “book” significantly remarked: “The
‘ mugs ’ know more than the ring, for once.”

A paper considers that “ Beach is wise to
keep out of the way of the nice little pitfalls that
beset the athlete in America.” Well, really, we
can’t quite see what harm William could come to
in America, if you ask us. The Yanks couldn't
make any “ pitfalls ’ that would trouble Beach
much, while he could construct many of a nature
calculated to discomfit the strongest mind, did he
care to. As a matter of fact, a lot of American
speculators are now engaged in playing ferret to
William’s badger, but the latter is not to be
“ drored ” till it suits him. We’ve seen William in
his ’appy ’ome, and we should think that on the
whole he has a splendid time of it. With regard
to the neighbourhood of Dapto for family feuds,
Verona was a fool to itl The Cliffords and the
Beachs have had a vendetta ever since the Middle
Ages, when they went at it with catapult and cul-
verin. William be not a fool: he will certainly
journey to America—when it suits him; and our
opinion Is, that though Beach may return from
thither with a very great deal of money, it would
be too much to expect of the champion to come
back with another idea.

The ingenuousness of the Sydney Globe
is something gigantic; indeed, it is a matter for
wonderment hW on earth there is room for so
much up such a very narrow passage. It says:—
“ It is strange how some runners nave a hankering

ness knows I bay you are a pedestrian. Well, you
fall down, for instance, within eigbt inches of the
tape in a match at Invereil, where you run under
the name of (van de Gubbins; therefore, nothing
will come handier than to enttr fcr Frank Smith s

By the way, another “ dreamer ” was upset
over the Newmarket Handicap at the recent Mel-
bourne meeting. Somebody in Brisbane had a
vision of Fair Ellen coming in alone. She did- but
nearly at the wrong end. Dreams are losing their
charm for the public. The general opinion is that
they are artful devices of the “ books.”

Slogger Sullivan is doing the “Greek
statues ”in a variety show round the States. As
an intellectual treat this must be about on a par
with “ Mace showing his trophies.” In our youth
we remember reveil’ng in the latter entertain-
ment. The trophies were brought into the middle
of a circus on a tray, and the dauntless Jem took
them up,one by one, and “showed” 'em to the
admiring thousands. Jem lays the odds now, and.
if he “ knows his book ” and bets round, must find
that a better game than showing trophies or
posing as Apollo. It isn’t likely that Sullivan wil i
ever take to the bookmaking business, it
wouldn’t suit him. The first time anyone “hit
him hard ” he’d want to retaliate by smashing up
the lucky backer.

The Bulletin staff challenged the staff
of the Daily Telegraph to a cricket match,
which was played on Thursday last on the Asso-
ciation Ground. A cool b etze and a nice light
lunch helped things along, and a very pleasant
contest ensued. The daily pressmen won the
toss and went to the wickets, where they compiled
a nice little score of 111. The Bulletin
men in turn went in, and only managed to
total 75. In the next innings, the Telegraph
team were not so fortunate as in the first, as they
were rather quickly disposed of for 95, The Bul-
letin followed, and when time was called, had
lost two wickets for S 3 runs, all the scoring having
been done by th« not-out men, who seemed to
have got hold of the bowling, and were hitting
with confidence and freedom. The match, there-
fore, looked a pretty open one, with the chances
in favour ot The Bulletin, but being unfinished,
was decided on the first innings. Of the Tele-
graph team Messrs. Crone and Patterson batted
with great success, and the bowling of Jones and
Robinson was very good, indeed. Mr. Shepherd at
the wickets was most efficient, and made several
victims, strongly contrasting with the Inefficiency
of the Bulletin wicket keeper, who let off three
of bis opponents. Flick and T. Traill bowled
well for The Bulletin, tne latter taking five
wic&ets. Tne fielding on both sides was quite
creditable for scratch teams. The Bulletin
now expect to be challenged in their turn.
"STERLING’S” STRAIGHT TIP.
Na'urally, the Press plays an Important part in
the conduct and government ot horse-racing 1 in
these colonies. The sporting writer is not merely
tue recorder or reporter ot passing events in the
sporting world, but the watchful censor and critic,
whose alert vigilance keeps rogues in terror, and
whose honest and out-spoken commentaries prt -
serve horse-racing comparatively speaking, clean
and undefile. For it must be remembered that
a spot which, ot necessity, appeals to the passion
for gambling, innate in human nature, presents
many temptations to the unscrupulous ana kna-
vish. The sporting writer then, whose function
it is to expose all trick and rascality on the turf,
is an important factor in the good government
and control of our most popular amusement.
Among the many capable gentlemen who direct
ttieir attention to the literature and record or
turf matters, there are few, if any, who are more
widely known and respected than Mr A. F
Bradshaw—who writes under the nom deplume of
“ Sterling.” Those who know him, whether in his
capacity as a writer upon racing subjects, a trainer,
or as a private gentleman, are aware that he is ex-
cellent in all respects. They will be glad, then, to
learn that he is recovering his health, which wa
so terribly shattered from the effects of a railway
accident some time ago. He owes his more recent
resuscitation to the use of Warner’s safe cure,
of which he writesFeeling seriously well, with
great weakness, and waking as tired in the morning
as I felt when I went to bed the night before, I
was advised by a friend to try Warner’s sale cure.
After some persausion I did so. A few doses gave
me great pain in the region of the kidneys, speedily
followed by a sensation of great relief and ease, i
used two bottles, with the happiest results, and I
now find myself restored to health.” 'i he man
who would reject such testimony as this would net
hesitate to marry his own grandmother for the
sake of her speetacles. It is unimpeachable, and
we are proud to set it before the public as one
more notable instance of the efficacy of that whieh
needs but to be keown to be commended.

There is a paper started in Melbourne
palled the BOOMehakq, which claims to be written,
afttup and printed by Australians. This explana
?inn as regards the publication, is one which is of
a highly necessary character. Two Buldoo niggers,
with a secondhand fount ot 1.p,, and a tin of iarnp-
hlack could have done far better. Just see some
nf the advice it gives“ Don’t be an oyster. It is
not a proper model for an Australian to copy.’’
nh ! isn’t it ? All wo can say is, that the sooner
the gifted writer of this brief homily becomes an
nv*ter-or a whelk—the better ; that is, it he en-
tertains the ambition of rising a rung upon the
ladder of intellect before his career is very pro-
perly terminated by the inevitable boot.
“Parliament in Session,” in the Sydney
PVHO is now written by “A Beetle.” On reading
the “ copy ” of this noble insect, it has struck us,
that though there may be any amount of “ hum ”
about it in one sense, there is surprisingly littie in
another. Here is a sample of “A Beetle’s”
"tyj e _in which, we suppose, is embodied a sample
of the only kind of humour acknowledged in the
HERALD office:-” This was too much for Mr.
Abigail, who raised a shriek like that of a de-
moted guinea fowl.” “ A demented guinea
mwll” We can just imagine how they laughed
over this in the reporters’ room, and how they
slapped the writer on the back and called him a
•■funny dog.” It is an easy thing to get a reputa
tion for humour amongst the S.M. boys; but, him
Mendue, you must have a reputation for holiness
to start with.
George Tipping was recently summoned
at the North Shore Police Court, Sydney, for
riotous conduct with “singing out ‘ Bow wow ’ in
the hearing of the police.” Mr. Addison, S.M., did
not think the offence serious, and discharged the
accused.—
Friend Tipping, you should never riot, never make
And never say such “awful” words as either
“ bow ” or “wow”;
You see this “awful” conduct has each North
Shore peeler vexed.
Why. man, they’ve information that you will he
whistling next;
Let us fervently advise you keep your " awful ”
tongue in check,
Or they ’ll catch you some fine evening, George,
and hang you by the neck.
A contemporary, under the heading of
11 Killed by a Fatal Error,” publishes a paragraph
Jn which a jury returned a verdict that Dr.
Tremaine, of Ores wick, Yic. (who has since
been committed for trial), had in mistake given
morphia for medicine ot another kind to Richard
Gostley, by which Richard at once became a ghost.
We know Dr. Tremaine, who is deservedly es-
teemed in the medical profession of Victoria and
by the people of Ballarat and surrounding dis-
tricts, as one of the cleverest doctoisin the colony.
Gostley’s complaint was rheumatism. He will
never have it again.—
With euch a name as his, what wonder
If Richard had long since gone under ?
And ’tis better far, than live in pain,
To die nor on earth T’remain;
The sad mistake for him was costly,
For Richard now is really Gostly.
We clip this reverently from an Adelaide
exchange:—“A split has occurred between the
‘Christian Crusaders.’ The Rev. A. Turnbull is
very bitter against the seceders in his letters to the
press—and, further, warns the public not to sub-
scribe to their mission.” This revives unpleasant
reminiscences of our first effort in the crusading
business, and we grasp our harp thoughtfully as
we chant:—
The “Kuristian Kbusader.”
At this news we’re quite upset,
And our eyes with tears we wet
As we sweep the strings and sing to
You in sympathetic tones.
How division brings disaster
Upon both flock and pastor,
When they quarrel o'er the picking of
Their captives' sinful bones.
We once put on our armour
And sallied forth to garner
The sheaves of golden wheat that
Strayed or fell upon the way,
And each raid upon “ Auld Clootie ”
Saw us pi.ing up more booty.
Till we thought we’d earned sufficient
To retire from the fray.
But, alas! when we relumed
For the share that we had earned
By fighting in the van to swell
The army ot the blest,
We received the awful shock
That tbe Captain of the flock
Had skipped across tbe water with
The regimental chest.
We cut no dismal capers
With “ our troubles ” in the papers
For the infidel to gloat upon, and
Laugh with rabid glee.
No! we only cursed the blunder
That had lest us all our plunder,
Then pawned our regimentals, and
Went out upon the sprte.
At Rockhampton (Q.) Police Court a lew-
weeks ago the “Comedy of Errors” was played
to perfection. One Peter Smith wes the first to
face the music, and having pleaded gui'ty. he was
discharged, on account of that being bis first ap-
pearance behind the spikes. Peter, scoordingiy,
stood not on the order of going, but he went at a
pace that would break Tom Malone’s best record
A Mr. Henry Mahon was then called to explain
Why he filled his tank to overflowing point with
tangle, and subsequently lay down in the road and
fought the air with Ms feet, to the imminent
danger of the passers-by. Henry, however, wes
carefully non est, and right here tbe trouble
began to boom. How Mr- Mahon managed to
escape from the cells was a matter no one could
understand, until an intelligent young thrap
suddenly remimbered that it was the pie
viousiy discharged Petvr Smith who ought to have
been hauled along for drunkenness, and Henry
Mahon for the offence of which Smith had pleaded
guilty. This difficulty was squared by/iiacharging
Henry as well as Peter, but the next case rendered
the confusion worse confounded, for a Mr. John
Hansen was found guilty of the offence for which
Smith was arraigned, the youthful gendarme
having mixed hioi up with Mahon. This was just
a trifle more than the Bench could stand, for as
Smith and Mahon had proved themselves to be
somebody else, and as it was likely that Mr. Hansen
might not be himself either, the P.M. discharged
him also and then went home and soaked his head
in ice to keep his brain from tangling itself up
into a second edition of the Gordian knot.
In excusing himself for the non-arrival of
a terrible typhoon, which he recently predicted,
Official Astronomer Russell, of Sydney, says:—
1 We labour under great disadvantages in the daily
reports furnished of the weather. In other
countries, telegrams connected with the Meteoro-
logical Department always take precedence of
other messages; but here in N.S.W. they do not.
Hence a message sent to me from Ade'alde at 9
a.m. will reach me at about 1 o’clock. What can
I do when messages relating to the Weather De-
partment do not take precedence over private and
other messages ?” Our own opinion 1s that so far
as one third of the “messages relating to the
Weather Department” are concerned it matters
little whether Mr. Russell receives them at 9 a.m ,
or never, for, as a matter of fact, he might just as
well found his predictions on a leaf from Sir
’Enery’s diary, or a page torn out of a Chinese in-
solvent’s ledger. Some of the telegraph clerks
look upon the whole thing as a farce, and when
pushed for time, or not in the humour to “graft,”
they have no scruple whatever iu trusting
their wind and weather reports to the care of an
imagination which seldom knows what it is to

which occur with painful regularity in the bul-

fulness over their reports by an occasional

occasions, at least, the reliable sheet pasted in
front of the head office Informed us that the sta’e
of affairs at the island town of Goulburn was,
“ S.W., line, sea rising,” and we have heard of one
abnormally intelligent operator who, while doing
Sunday duty, used to haul out Mr. Rugsell s blank
sheets, and fill in all the wind and weather reports
on his line for the coming week. Our boss astrono-
mer should prowl round the operating-room in
disguise some day, and then he’ll wake up t© the
fact that when it comes to a question of fertility
of imagination the average ligntning-jerker could
give even Shakespeare 30 cut of 100 op and then
beat him hollow.

EXPERIENCE.
The Rev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary In New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of tho
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows:
“78 E, 54 th St,, New York, May 18, 1882.
Messes. J. 0. Ayer & Co., Gentlemen ;
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially ray limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that I could scarcely bear any clothing
over them. I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and my system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. I feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. 1 took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles, 1 place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
, Yours respectfully, Z. P. Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from impure or impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’sSarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrofu-
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the 'Skin, Itheu-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system.
