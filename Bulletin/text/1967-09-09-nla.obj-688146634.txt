BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
They're high,
wide, handsome
and available
YOU MAY NOT believe it, but Mel-
bourne has suffered terribly lately from
unopenings. Admittedly we had good
openings for the National Mutual
centre, for the Royal Insurance build-
ing, and at Scottish Amicable House,
where, glory be, we even had haggis
and the finest Scottish dew.
But what now?
I’ll tell you. There has been an un-
fortunate trend. People have been
sneaking into their buildings without
telling anyone. lIP bad no opening for
their building, Shell didn’t open theirs,
nor did Conzinc Riotinto, and the Re-
serve Bank didn’t invite the city into
their marble palace. It is not easy to
understand the reason for this, seeing
that we have so many people available
to do grand openings architects,
politicians, builders all love them. Do
they have a sudden feeling of inferi-
ority? After all this effort in providing
prestige office space, are they suddenly
terrified that shareholders might ask
how much it all cost? However, with so
much unopening and unspeeching
going on, how fortunate we are that
we have Princes Gate to make up for
it.
Plere we have a building that has
given us three openings already and
three lots of parties and speeches. First,
we had the opening of Princes Gate
railway station, next we had the open-
ing of the Princes Plaza, the splendid
decking overlooking the corner, and
now we have just had the opening, by
Sir Henry Bolte, of the West Tower.
In three months’ time there will also
be the opening, with party, of the East
Tower. For those of us who specialise
and believe in openings, this is very
fine. Four openings for the one build-
ing is a track record.
But let’s explain about Princes Gate.
It rates four openings because this is
something that we have been dreaming
about for an era or two. A railways
architect first suggested roofing over the
vast ugly Jolimont railway yards back
in 1897. You know the speed with which
we follow up these suggestions
Princes Gate is the first stage of the
process. It has twin 18-storey towers, a
large car park, a large open Plaza, and
through, round, and under all this we
have railway trains.
The West Tower is being occupied
largely by the Gas and Fuel Corpora-
tion and this opening was charmingly
different. In the old days a Premier
would win a jewel-studded silver trowel
and, over a long period of office, a good
Premier could pick up 100 or so jewel-
studded silver trowels'. Last Thursday
Sir Henry made his speech, pulled back
a curtain to reveal a plaque and lit
the first gas jet. A gas jet lighting is
something distinctly different, and Mrs.
Chadwick, Chairman of. the Gas and
Fuel Corporation, presented him with
a lamp powered by heatane gas for the
Bolte sheep property to investigate
early-morning lambings and such.
But here’s the rub about Princes
Gate, it is an enormous building. It is
easily the biggest in Victoria and only
the Australia Square project in Sydney
is a serious rival. Mr. Dusseldorp, Chair-
man of Lend Lease and Chairman of
the Princes Gate Company, said how
happy they were to have gas and fuel
because tenants were on a buyers’
market “and they knew it.”
How true: Dear reader, an extra-
ordinary situation has set in. We have
had the greatest building boom since the
1880 s. Actually so much was built be-
tween 1880 and 1893 that, but for the
Manchester Unity, we hardly put up
another darned thing until 1946. Now
the skyline is cluttered with marble
palaces ... most of which have signs
down in the foyer, “PRESTIGE
OFFICE SPACE TO LET.” A friend
of ours who has an awfully prestigious
17th-floor office reports that he can
now see 13 rooftops cranes. All signi-
fying big office projects. This, he
claims, is a record. The simple bat-
manic mind doesn’t really understand.
Let’s go on a small city tour. There’s
the Bank of New South Wales build-
ing at the corner of Collins and Swans-
“I move we quit the space race!”
ton. This is a very swish new building
and it has had 60,000 square feet going
begging. Real-estate men, somewhat un-
kindly, have called it the “Wails”
corner. Scottish Amicable House in
Queen Street, that very place Sir
Robert opened with haggis and all
back in 1965, was still offering office
space last month. Royal Insurance, too,
the place we called the Black Stump,
also opened by Sir Robert in that fine
time for openings back in 1965, has
been finding the last few areas of space
hard to fill. The Northern and Em-
ployers building next door has had
exciting notices outside like “fully car-
peted heavy duty, deep pile carpets
throughout” . . . “air-conditioning -
individual temperature controls.”
The Legal and General in Collins
Street, a brand-new unopened building,
is offering whole floors, there’s 460
Bourke Street right in the heart of town
offering “delightful views over the bay”
and then there are all the buildings still
going up —the splendid openings of 1968
and 1969, 350 Collins Street, 351 Col-
lins Street, and the AMP building, a
mighty complex, which will have a
tower of; 26 floors and accommodation
for 3800 people.
We could go on and on, estimates vary
on space now available from 300,000 to
1,000,000 square feet.
Then early last month we had the
announcement of a $2O million block
for the north side of Bourke Street be-
tween William and King. This was to
have 42 storeys, 520 ft. high, not
much lower than the Australia Square
tower. It would have 18 lifts, closed-
circuit color TV, “peripheral air-con-
ditioning with balanced humidity and
individual fingertip control” ... in
short, as prestigious as all hell. At the
moment there is a conflict with the
Melbourne City Council over documents
and it remains to be seen whether this
project will go ahead.
We consulted Mr. Gordon Banfield,
architect of the whopping new Bourke
Street project, and suggested the finan-
ciers were brave. He said: “We won’t
have any trouble filling the 42 storeys.
The buildings that are empty in Mel-
bourne are those that don’t provide car
parking and easy access.”
Other reasons have been put for-
ward. Some say Sydney does much
better because, with its jetport, harbor,
and all, it grabs all the big American
and Japanese companies. Others say
“prestige office space” with air-
conditioning, marble, acoustic ceiling
w.-to-w. carpets, etc., is just too darned
expensive. Others say it’s getting easier
to have your office down in St. Kilda
Road.
Whatever the reason, we’re simply
not breeding clerks fast enough. Par-
kinson’s Law is not galloping fast
enough to keep up with the builders.
Gentlemen, this is a problem for
today and tomorrow. Melbourne needs
many more city bums for office seats.
I think the answer lies in more pres-
tigious openings of office space.

“Oz” invades London
THE LONDON OFFICE of “Oz”
magazine is either in a state of frenzy
or completely and eerily deserted. It
is not really an office, since it is only
partitioned off from a secretarial em-
ployment bureau, but from it Richard
Neville and Martin Sharp are making
a slap-dash attack on the English
magazine market.
The success of London “Oz” (third
issue out and—who knows? —with any
luck a fourth to come) certainly can-
not be laid at the door of tried and
true methods. Continuity is in the
hands of the printers. “They are abso-
lutely immoral in England,” says
Neville. “They look me in the eye and
lie.” To Neville, London “Oz” is a
bit of a joke. He intended only to do
one issue and seems to be feeling that
eventually a university-style maga-
zine has to grow up: but circulation has
more than trebled from its original
15,000.
To Sharp the magazine seems very
important and he listens seriously
(when he is there) to the perpetual
telephone complaints that the issue is
late. He feels that “Oz” is involved
with “what’s going on in underground
London.”
But the “Oz” boys are finding it
hard to shock the placid Anglo-Saxon.
“No one cares what we wear over here,
or how long our hair is. We just go
anywhere and no one even looks,” says
Martin Sharp.

Novel
FROM THE BLURB for a new novel:
“Yoshar the soldier deserts from the
Army during a campaign, only to em-
bark on a struggle in which, slowly
and unwittingly, he wins the love and
understanding of the girl he has raped.”
We find it hard to keep up with the
latest, but we would feel, or hope, this
is a new angle.
Red Shadow on a bicycle
“IT WAS SAID of me in Brisbane, the
Red Shadow Rides Again, not on a
white horse but on a two-wheeler.” Max
Oldaker, a wry cross between Jack
Buchanan and Ivor Novello, once the
famous star of “The Desert Song,” was
talking about his performance in “Half
a Sixpence,” currently at the Theatre
Royal, Sydney, as a playwright whose
opening appearance is riding a bicycle
vigorously on stage. “I’m always afraid
of doing grievous bodily harm to Mark
McManus,” he added.
Until his triumphant return to the
stage as the Duchess in the Phillip
Theatre’s “Alice in Wonderland,” last
Christmas, Oldaker had for years been
out of the scene, in Tasmania. His
career began with the Westminster
Glee Singers at the old Palace Theatre
in 1930; another of the singers had been
Wilfrid Thomas. Oldaker left the
company, after an Eastern tour, in
Malaya, where he had been left penni-
less. He got to London third class on
a Dutch boat with £8 in his pocket.
He made folding records that could be
put in a waistcoat pocket, doubling with
a baritone, and toured in “The Choco-
late Soldier” for three years.
Oldaker sang in Grand Opera, includ-
ing Wagner, crooned with Joe Loss, and
appeared in a Charles Cochrane pro-
duction of “Anythng Goes.” Later, he
toured English seaside resorts in the
famous concert parties of the ’thirties,
with Arthur Askey as the chief come-
dian. Jeanne de Casalis discovered him,
Introduced him to Noel Coward, and
thereby secured for him a leading role
in “Operette.” Coward’s musical also
starred the famous diseuse Fritzi Mas-
sary in her last stage appearance; the
part was written by Coward especially
to fit Oldaker’s talents. “Bobby Get
Your Gun,” with Bobby Howes fol-
lowed, then a return to Australia, with
the long period of touring in Gilbert
and Sullivan, “The Desert Song,” and
the Phillip revues. Then there was a
brief period as understudy to Rex
Harrison in “My Fair Lady,” in Lon-

don. On one occasion, he played the
part when Harrison had laryngitis.
What had been his most awkward ex-
perience in the theatre? “In 1934 I was
in a musical called ‘The Three Sisters,’
not to be confused with Chekhov, and
we had a black horse which wasn’t
exactly house-trained and couldn’t
always be relied upon to behave. Far
more trouble were a flock of sheep and
a gaggle of geese; they certainly didn’t
‘behave’ at all. In fact, the geese finally
had to be written out all together.”
He greatly missed the period of Ivor
Novello, whose part in “The Dancing
Years” he had toured in the English
provinces, and found nothing to admire
in the post kitchen-sink era.
“Novello was a charming man who
believed in his Ruritarian characters,”
he said. “He had a very romantic view
of things.” He greatly misses the dis-
cipline of the theatre of the ’thirties, as
well as its escapist charm.
Organising art
SETTING UP an easel in the life-
class room for his charts and diagrams,
Mr. Leo Butler briskly outlined his
scheme to rescue Sydney’s 77-year-old
Julian Ashton Art School.
After 33 years’ musty coexistence
with the gold nuggets and settled dust
of the Mining Museum in North
George Street, the school has been told
that it must soon pack up its paint
boxes and leave because the Museum
downstairs is bursting at its seams.
That’s where Mr. Butler, Sydney
manager of the Hunter Valley Research
Foundation and a friend of Mr. Dick
Ashton, the school’s principal, came
in. At a meeting at the School Mr.
Butler unfolded his plan.
“If we want to turn this school into
a fine arts centre equal to any in the
world we must raise $lOO,OOO to start
with,” Mr. Butler told the meeting.
“A corporate structure is a must,” he
went on, tapping the words: A LEGAL
ENTITY.
“And we must find a site for the
school in its own building on its own
land,” he reiterated when he turned
to the chart marked PRESENT
ACTIVITIES.
Someone suggested that perhaps an
exhibition of works by all the students
of the school, past and present, would
help the cause. “Just the sort of thing
we want for our small-scale fund-
raising,” Mr. Butler said approvingly.
A young man in the audience won-
dered whether Dobell might send a
painting to the show. “And we might
get a Lambert, or a Lindsay, or Pass-
more ... or Olsen . . . perhaps Brett
Whiteley . . .” someone else suggested
going through a list of some of the
school’s more famous ex-students.
Mr. Butler’s businesslike meeting
broke up then as enthusiastic plans for
whist drives and play readings and
musicales were put forward.
A breath of change is moving
through the Julian Ashton Art School,
and it will never be quite the same
again.

‘Urban Man’
in aluminium by sculptor lan Bow.
‘Frontispiece for Ford Fairlane’
in aluminium by Alcoa.
The grille of a modern car is usually sculptural.
Its form can suggest strength, grace, dignity,
or power. And a natural medium for the
creation of such a form is Alcoa aluminium.
It's such a versatile metal, with an infinite
variety of types and tempers. It can be cast,
rolled, extruded, drawn, forged, stamped or
spun—riveted, brazed, welded or bonded. It is
practical and decorative. There are limitless
applications for this extraordinary metal.
Unlike the usual sculptural forms, the Alcoa
aluminium grille and side mouldings on the
new Fairlane don’t stand around on a pedestal
They have to withstand a tremendous amount
of wear and weather. So, the metal in these
exterior trims must be of exceptional quality.
For the side mouldings, Alcoa produced the
rigidly controlled aluminium alloy 5457 —H 25
temper, the first time this quality alloy
has been made in Australia.
But generally, standing up to rough treatment
is no problem to aluminium. It is light, strong,
and naturally resistant to corrosion.
Alcoa aluminium is a superior metal to work
with. Ford has takenadvantage of its versatility.

AS I SEE IT
Nightmare union
attitudes
on Hong Kong
By ALAN REID
IF THE AUSTRALIAN Labor Party
gives the impression to a significant part
of the Australian electorate that some
of its components tend toward pro-
Communism, it has only itself to
blame.
On the communist side, these com-
ponents of the Labor Party find an
excuse for anything from murder to
authoritarianism of the most brutal
kind. They reserve their opprobrium
for allies like the United States, Britain
(which since World War II has freed
more colonial people than any imperial
nation in history), and non-Communists
generally. They attack war-torn South
Vietnam for imperfections in the way
it is conducting an election, but have
no criticism to offer of communist
systems that do not provide for elections
of any kind.
It would be amusing if it were not
sick.
Take the case of Hong Kong.
Twenty-seven Australian trade unions
21 of them named by External
Affairs Minister Paul Hasluck in the
House of Representatives have sent
a protest petition to the Governor of
Hong Kong.
The protest demands that the
British authorities in Hong Kong:
• Stop immediately all “fascist” meas-
ures.
• Set free all arrested persons, includ-
ing workers and journalists.
• Punish those responsible for the
“atrocities” and compensate the victims
for their sufferings and losses.
• Guarantee no recurrence of the
incidents.
What kind of dreamland (or night-
mareland) are these Labor Party com-
ponents living in, or desiring the Aus-
tralian people to live in?
I find attitudes such as these frighten-
ing not in the physical but in the
intellectual sense.
Whatever else may be the position
in Hong Kong, the following can be
said with reasonable accuracy:
The Governor of Hong Kong, to
whom this petition from Australian
trade unionists was directed, is the
servant of the British Government. The
British Government is a Labor Govern-
ment and it is of the same political
complexion as many of the signatories
to the petition. The Governor can be
replaced if he is doing the wrong
thing. In other words, these trade
unions the bulk of whose members
are presumably ALP do not hesi-
tate to attack their own kind.
With Hong Kong in the military
situation that it could be taken over
in a matter of hours by China’s mili-
tary might, the British obviously are
not out to be provocative.
But the British have to keep law and
order. Murders have been committed.
According to Hasluck, bombs have
been thrown, children killed, and for-
tified arsenals prepared for what he
described as “guerilla warfare in an
urban setting.” Hong Kong police are
trying to locate and deal with offenders
against the law. There might be some
excuse for the Australian trade unions
if the normal legal processes in Hong
Kong had been suspended.
But I checked with the External
Affairs Department. They have no
knowledge (and they are positive they
would have if the contrary were the
case) that there has been any change
in the normal legal processes in Hong
Kong.
Those offending against the criminal
law in Hong Kong will go through
legal processes similar to those we have
in Australia before they can be con-
victed. Is this Fascism, or has the
word lost all meaning to these repre-
sentatives of the Labor Movement.
I know the excuse the Labor Party
will make. The Australian voters will
be told that only some of the signa-
tories to the trade union petition were
members of the Labor Party. Others
were Communists. The voters will be
told, that the ALP does not interfere
in the internal affairs of trade unions
and that this action by the 27 Austra-
lian trade unions falls in the category
of “internal affairs.” Personally, I
think that this type of action is the
complete reply to those sectors of the
Labor Party which say that there
should be no interference by the ALP
in internal trade union matters —that
unity tickets between Communists and
ALP members in trade union elections
do not matter and do not influence
ALP foreign or domestic policies.
I have no doubt that I am going to
be told there is no connection between
the fact that persons closely associated
with the Left-wing Victorian ALP
executive signed the anti-British Hong
Kong petition, and the fact that the
Victorian delegation at the recent
Adelaide Federal ALP conference in
Adelaide initiated the Party’s foreign
policy which laid down conditions for
the continuing presence of Australian
troops in South Vietnam.
Principal beneficiary from the Hong
Kong petition was the Peking radio.
With gusto it reported that “respon-
sible officials of more than 20 Vic-
torian and Federal trade unions have
strongly denounced the British fascist
atrocities against Chinese patriots in
Hong Kong.”
At the receiving end were the police
in Hong Kong who found their murder
suspects transformed with Australian
connivance into “patriots.”
Mr. William Wentworth (Lib.,
N.S.W.) can, with considerable justi-
fication, see a pattern emerging from
things of this kind. His belief is that
the Communists are trying to break the
morale of the non-Communists in Hong
Kong (and it is an irony of history that
quite a considerable section of the
present inhabitants of Hong Kong fled
to what Australian unionists now call
“British Fascism” rather than live
among the people now described as
“patriots”).
Wentworth was speaking of the
stiffener given NLF morale by the pro-
posal by Australian university students
to supply the NLF with aid from Aus-
tralia when he said: “It (action to
break non-Communist morale) is being
taken so that all over the world com-
munist circles can infiltrate into jour-
nals the news that Australian univer-
sities are supporting our enemies in
Vietnam.”
But he could easily be.describing the
situation as regards Britain’s internal
enemies in Hong Kong.
If, with actions such as those on
Hong Kong, Labor gets itself identified
in Australian minds with pro-Com-
munism, the Party cannot escape by
saying that this action is not ALP-
inspired but a product of trade union
decision.
Labor describes itself as “the trade
union” Party while it does little (how
long is it since there has been action
over a unity ticket?) to see that the
trade unions do not fall under control
of Communists or their sympathisers.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES ON
THE
ECONOMY
It's almost too
late for the
Resources Bank
THE SOONER THE Australian Re-
sources Development Bank gets crack-
ing, the better. It is already about ten
years too late to prevent an unreason-
ably high proportion of the Australian
mineral industry from falling into
foreign hands. For let there be no mis-
take, a lack of local interest and
financial support has been a major
factor in the fearfully large stake that
foreigners have acquired in this fastest
developing sector in the Australian
economy.
True, some of the local banks,
financial institutions (like life offices),
and diversification-minded industrial
companies like CSR have belatedly
done something about it. But by now
the damage has been done. We needed
their interest and we needed the
existence of a source of development
finance such as the proposed bank
promises to be when the iron ore
boom was beginning, for example,
rather than now when most of the
arrangements have been well and truly
made. For the new Resources Bank, to
be owned by all the trading banks, and
with the Reserve Bank having a stake
in it also, is designed to raise loan
money both at home and overseas for
investment development projects like
iron ore mining. It will help provide
the sort of loan funds that will enable
Australian developers to lessen their
dependence on foreign sources of cash,
which in so many instances has meant
selling off a large slice of the action
overseas.
But how serious is all this fuss about
foreign control? Admitting all the
points that people like CRA’s Sir
Maurice Mawby make about the need
for this foreign investment if these
projects were to go ahead in view of
our own indolence at the time, foreign
control is simply right out of
proportion.
Look at the iron ore export industry.
Projects costing more than $625 million
have started in recent years or are
planned for the next few years. Aus-
tralian companies have only a one-
third stake in them and the only
reason the proportion is as high as
that is because of the 60 percent Aus-
tralian share in the Mt. Newman pro-
ject, which has yet to get really on
the move. Not only are profits already
very large, but the future is likely to
be phenomenal. Already contracts for
the supply of 200 million tons of iron
ore and 130 million tons of iron pellets,
worth about $3OOO million have been
signed, mainly to Japan. And last
week’s withdrawal of the Government’s
“guidelines” price for iron ore, which
had prevented sales below 18 U.S. cents
per unit, is certain to result in huge
additions to these orders.
As the Sydney broking house Ord
Minnett, T. J. Thompson and Partners
points out in a new booklet on the
Australian mining industry, crude steel
output in Japan had risen by 150 per-
cent between 1960 and 1967, to 52
million tons, and is expected to reach
70 million tons by the early 19705.
“Despite competition from other sup-
plier countries, prospects of Australian
producers securing additional Japanese
iron ore contracts appear good. Both
the high grade of Australian reserves
and the shorter distance to Japan
(approximately 3500 miles from north-
western Australia compared with nearly
5000 miles from India and between
9000 and 12,000 miles from South
American sources) are to Australia’s
advantage.” And on top of that
Australia is considered to have good
prospects for additional sales to West-
ern European steel producers (some
shipments have already gone there)
and there are long-term prospects of
sales to U.S. producers that may set
up on their west coast.
But it’s not just in iron ore that
foreign domination is so evident. It is
right across the natural resources spec-
trum. The Australian oil search indus-
try is heavily dominated from overseas;
our two producing oil fields are mostly
owned from overseas, with local par-
ticipation being relatively minor. And
even the mighty BHP has an American
company, Esso, as a partner in its signi-
ficant Bass Strait discoveries. The
bauxite mining business, now in the
midst of dramatic development, is dom-
inated from overseas, although there
are important Australian investments
in it. For instance, Alcoa of the U.S.
has only a bare majority holding in its
Australian company which is now min-
ing and processing its reserves of 500
million tons in W.A. but it is still
in control.
So the problem of foreign ownership
is a real one in the mineral industry.
Had we marshalled our resources
better, we could have had a bigger
stake in all this. It’s not too late to
get the Resources Bank going—but it
almost is.

AUSTRALIA
How swiftly the Government can
move when it wants to
THE DEVELOPMENT of a small,
Universities-centred issue into an act-
of-urgency legislation in Federal Par-
liament within a few weeks must stand
as one of the speediest responses the
Holt Government has made to any
matter.
The issue was the proposed and
then actual sending of aid to the Viet
Cong National Liberation Front by
Victorian University Labor Clubs.
A blow-by-blow history of the issue
reveals the swiftness with which the
Government acted.
July 16: Questions were asked in the
House about a plan by Monash Uni-
versity students to send aid to the NLF
(political arm of the Viet Cong) in
Vietnam. Attorney-General Bowen
was said to be looking into the legal
aspects.
July 26: Staff at Melbourne Uni-
versity found an appeal for donations
for “Civil Aid for Vietnam” in their
pay packets. The appeal was from the
Students’ Representative Council and
presumably was related to World Uni-
versity Students’ Aid to Vietnam Week.
August 18: Senator McManus
(DLP) put a motion of urgency before
the House which directly indicated that
action should be taken under the
Crimes Act on the matter of this pro-
posed financial aid to the enemy.
On the same day the Prime Minister
told the House of Representatives:
Francis James... comparatively easy
“We will do everything in our power
to prevent any material aid being sent
to the Communist National Liberation
Front.”
August 17: It wasn’t going to be
easy. Attorney-General Bowen began
diafting new legislation to cover the
offence of sending material aid to
North Vietnam. It was explained that
the penalties which seemed appropri-
ate under the Crimes Act (death or life
imprisonment) were considered too
severe and such action would attract
attention to what the Government
wished to keep an unsensational issue.
Meanwhile the Opposition was
busy dissociating itself from any Labor
Club group in Australian universities.
August 18: Mr. Francis James (chair-
man of the “Anglican” newspaper and
1966 Liberal Reform candidate)
announced that he had been sending
money to both sides for some time,
adding that it was comparatively easy
for a private citizen to send money to
North Vietnam.
August 21: The Monash University
Labor Club announced that it had sent
more than $6OO to the National Libera-
tion Front. Copies of a statement by
the “Committee For Aid” setting out
their policy were sent to all Federal
parliamentarians.
August 23: The Attorney-General, in
a joint meeting of the Government
parties, outlined the provisions of his
Nigel Bowen QC... close loophole
new legislation, designed, he said, to
“close a loophole in the Crimes Act.”
The proposals included a maximum fine
of $2OOO for offenders' and a range of
imprisonment from six months to two
years.
August 27: In a move that suddenly
brought the whole issue back to the
front pages, the Australian Council of
Churches Inter-Church Aid, Refugees
and World Service Division made a
direct appeal to the Prime Minister not
to block humanitarian aid to North
Vietnam.
The churches were promptly assured
that the proposed legislation did not
exclude such aid.
August 29: The legislation - titled
the Defence Forces Protection Bill
was introduced in the House of Repre-
sentatives. By astutely maintaining a
firm anti-aid public policy, the ALP was
now in a position to hear the reading
without the slightest feelings of duty
to oppose. The Government conceded
an ALP amendment that persons
charged with “major crimes” would be
tried by jury.
The Bill reached the Senate this:
week.
Disregarding the import of this par-
ticular Bill, it seems a pity that Gov-
ernment doesn’t legislate with similar
speed and efficiency in its normal pro-
ceedings.
The Opposition
Agreement, but...
THE LABOR PARTY decided not to
oppose the Holt Government’s legisla-
tion prohibiting provision of finance
and supplies to the National Liberation
Front, against whom Australian soldiers
are fighting. But it then put up a solid
phalanx of six speakers to attack the
legislation.
The speakers were the Opposition
Leader, Mr. Gough Whitlam, his
Deputy, Mr. Barnard, Dr. Jim Cairns
(Vic.), Mr. Rex Connor (N.S.W.),
Mr. William Hayden (Q.), Mr. Tom
Uren (N.S.W.), and Mr. Bryant (Vic.).
For sheer virtuosity Whitlam turned
in the best performance. He worked
hard to create the impression that Prime
Minister Harold Holt was responsible
for the legislation rather than the
actions of those Australians who were
seeking to send aid to the NLF.
Other contributors from Labor sup-
porters of the Bill were:
Farnard: “We cannot oppose the Bill


because we insist there must be abso-
lutely no suspicion that Australian
funds are being used to assist those
opposed to Australian troops in Viet-
nam. We say that there are grave
doubts as to whether the legislation
was necessary at all, and whether its
objectives could not have been achieved
in a more rational way.”
Cairns: “I would say it is no more
right to send aid to the National Lib-
eration Front than it is to send aid to
the South Vietnamese Government . . .
I think that the situation in Vietnam
is such that there is little to choose
between the sides.”
Connor: “It (the Government) has
created its own political stalking horse
which it will not cease to use.”
Hayden: “What has happened in this
case is merely another example of the
Government’s attempts to create an
issue for the purposes of the forth-
coming election.”
Uren: “With the exception of the
amendment to the Crimes Act in 1960
and the legislation permitting the con-
scription of our youth to the jungles
of Vietnam, I know of no legislation
that has made me more eager to raise
my voice in protest than this Bill.”
Bryant: “I agree with the Bill but I
would not bring it in myself. Let me
put it this way: the Labor Party is not
opposing the Bill nor is it proposing it.
It is agreeing to it.”
Notable absentee from the debate
was Labor MHR for the A.C.T. Mr.
Jim Fraser.
In a broadcast •on August 25, Mr.
Fraser said: “To suggest that people in
this country should send money which
could be used to arm and equip those
against whom our men are fighting is
surely monstrous.”
Students
Non-violence
MILITANT QUEENSLAND Univer-
sity student leader Brian Laver likes
to do things properly.
Last week he conducted lunch-hour,
on campus classes in the finer points
of “non-violent disobedience.”
“These special techniques were first
evolved by Gandhi, you know,” he
says. “Then they were perfected in
the American Civil Rights demonstra-
tions.
“There is the sit down, knees up,
hands over head, roll to the left or
right technique very useful. Then
there is the sit down link arms tech-
nique. It stops the police from arrest-
ing just one person they must arrest
everybody.”
Laver perhaps the most active
Laver ... not retaliating
member of the University-based Civil
Liberties Co-ordinating Committee
was preparing his 500 or so followers
for this week’s protest march from the
St. Lucia campus to the city.
The march, he hopes, will help to
push the State Government into con-
sidering a submission on the revision
of legislation covering public demon-
strations.
Specific regulations referred to in
the submission were the requirements
to give 14 days’ notice of a demonstra-
tion and to pay a $1 fee to carry a
placard.
“The basic technique to be observed
at all times during encounters with
police is the one which involves simply
putting your hands on your head. In
this position it is obvious that the
demonstrator is not retaliating.”
Brian Laver a cousin of Rod’s
knows a few other tricks, too. “But
we probably won’t need them just yet.
They involve non-violent protection
from police dogs . . . stuff like that.”
Non-violent police dogs?
Wentworth MHR... root out
Mass media
Pooling ignorance
ON THE DUSTY BANKS of the
Clarence River at Grafton, between
floodtime and Jacaranda Festival, a
distinguished if rather indiscriminately
assorted gathering was held last week
to consider mass media in Australia.
The stated aim of the University of
New England’s seminar was to examine
mass media’s impact on Australia’s
current moral and cultural standards.
But the seminar soon developed into
such a detailed consideration of mass
media itself that a N.S.W. provincial
newspaper manager was provoked to
deliver a highly sensitive (and un-
programmed) homily accusing it of put-
ting mass media on trial and subject-
ing it to “continuous, unwarranted and
biased smear.”
This just wasn’t true. The hard core
of broadcasters and journalists at the
seminar had no feeling that the dock
was closing round them, even though
they were heavily outnumbered by
academics, social workers, and profes-
sional Christians. In fact, criticism of
the media was generally mild, construc-
tive and tempered with intelligent
appreciation of its problems.
Attempts were made to unblunt a
few political axes. Senator S. H. Cohen,
QC, deputy Opposition Leader in the
Senate, wanted a Government-inspired
if not dictated Newspaper Commission
to establish new capital city newspapers-
and give the present proprietors “a
little hurry up.” Mr. W. C. Wentworth,.
MHR for Mackellar, wanted journal-
ism to root out its subversive elements
of a certain political persuasion. And
the two representatives of that - per-
suasion at the seminar obviously wanted
something done about newspaper pro-
prietors and the rights of minority
expression.
We also learned some interesting;
facts about the mass media habits of
mass media critics. Professor S. Encel,
a sociologist, has no TV set. Mr. D.
Broadfoot, secretary of the National
Television Council, has a television set
but considers it the least satisfactory
cash investment he has ever made. Mr.
Kit Denton probably does not consider
his set a bad investment because he
writes both for television and about it
in the “Australian.” But he had some
harrowing tales to tell of the way the
“Australian” slashes and changes his.
copy “not simply in style, but in con-
tent.”
The seminar had almost unqualified
admiration for Tasmania’s attempts to
give schoolchildren good mass media
habits by making practical film appreci-
ation part of the English curriculum
and publishing children’s television
guides. Seminar members wanted more
innovations of this kind, and also an
increase and improvement in training
for journalism.
There was a universal feeling that


the Vincent Report should be trans-
ferred from its pigeon hole to the floor
of the House of Representatives, a view
Bill Arthur, Federal Member for
Barton, promised to make known in
Canberra.
One of the seminar study groups
proposed that instead of Senator
Cohen’s Newspaper Commission, the
Government should establish a national
printing complex, available without
discrimination to any organisation
which wanted publishing facilities. This
would overcome the problem of the
enormous cost of establishing plant for
a new newspaper, which Greg Taylor,
assistant editor of the “Age,” put at
$lO million.
But another study group was pre-
pared to see some practical advantages
in the present concentration of news-
paper ownership in a few hands. It
pointed out that the “Australian”
would never have started or survived
if it had not been backed by the strong
resources of the News Ltd. group.
Surprisingly sex hardly reared its
controversial head. A study group
which included Dick Lane, scriptwriter
of “You Can’t See Round Corners,”
regretted that mass media exploited
sex in a sensational manner. But it
strongly believed TV programs should
be made realistically and with integrity.
“No useful purpose can be served by
presenting a fairy floss world which only
invokes ridicule from the young.”
Perhaps the greatest underlying feel-
ing at the seminar was that Australia
needed much more detailed research
into mass media and its effects. The
present lack of data on which to base
sound conclusions left many members
foundering. As a university lecturer put
it in an aside on the last day: “We have
successfully pooled our ignorance.”
P-New Guinea
Germinating
IT HAD ONLY been a month since
the big, soft-voiced Papuan stood at
the podium in Sydney University’s
pseudo-Gothic Great Hall and told the
politely bored audience that indepen-
dence could come to New Guinea by
1970, but this week his unremarkable
statement led to his expulsion from
the Pangu Pati.
The occasion had been the Evatt
Memorial Lecture, an annual event
organised by the students’ Fabian
Society and addressed last year by
Gough Whitlam. Those who attended
certainly had no feeling that Oala-
Rarua had said anything remarkable.
The only spark of interest raised by a
generally pedestrian address had
come near the end. Referring to the
de facto “native” membership of the
trade unions, he had commented that
“very few Australians in New Guinea
have regarded themselves as workers.”
On the question of independence he
had been caution itself. “The question
of when and how,” he had said, “is
Australia’s responsibility.” But this
week the ultra-conservative Highland
politicians panicked and he was ex-
pelled as too radical. It was a move
widely interpreted in Australia as a
sop to the Members of the House of
Assembly, whom the Pangu Pati hoped
to attract to its banner at the current
sittings.
In the Highlands block, the biggest
in the Assembly, any talk of indepen-
dence is feared and equated with push-
ing the Australian out. These Members
come from the very core of “Seventh
State” sentiment in the country, and
their views on independence would
come very much closer to those of the
mission sponsored Christian Demo-
cratic Union.
The incident demonstrated, for those
Australians who had any doubts, that
the present membership of the House
of Assembly is conservative and timid
toward change. But it should not be
taken as evidence that this will always
remain the case. It demonstrates,
rather, a developing gulf between town
rebels and rural conservatives such as
we have seen in other colonies ap-
proaching independence.
It is in the towns, and from such
town leaders as Mr. Oala-Rarua, that
any trouble we experience will come.
Only a few thousand Papuans and New
Guineans live in the four big urban
centres, but each one is a melting pot
in which men from tribes which a
generation ago would have killed on
sight, now throw around the heady
ideas of nationalism together. C. D.
Rowley, the most perceptive observer
yet to come out of New Guinea, had it
all in one sentence, written about Port
Moresby, “Here the new order is be-
ing born; and this is the germ of the
new nation.”
Oala-Rarua... expelled
ACTU Congress
Hawke swoops
TWO MEN STAND OUT as having
most to gain from the victory of the
Left coalition at last week’s ACTU
Congress: Mr. Albert Monk and Mr.
Bob Hawke. On the previous execu-
tive the Right-wing forces were well
in command (hence the description by
an opponent that the “ACTU was the
graveyard of industrial disputes”) and
Mr. Monk was not often called on to
play his favorite role of maintaining
the balance of power. The executive
was a potential threat to the aging
president’s tenure of office, and also
to his manifest desire to designate who
is to be his successor.
Before the present Congress, Monk
was concerned at the possibility that
if the Left suffered a severe defeat this
time they would move further away
from the ACTU and perhaps even set
up some kind of rival organisation. The
new executive offers the hope of some
influence to the Communists and their
supporters.
A lot of the organisational credit
for solving some of Monk’s problems
must be given to Hawke, who worked
hard to help create an executive more
representative of the Left-wing unions.
His success in co-ordinating strategy
and organising votes amazed those wha
had been inclined to write him off as
only an intelligent back-room boy.
The stake for Bob Hawke is high, but
not unattainable: the next presidency of
the ACTU. Hawke is a Fabian-type
social and economic reformer and not
in any way pro-Communist but he has
for some time realised that to beat his
two rivals for the presidency, Harold
Souter (ACTU secretary) and Joe
Riordan (the Federal secretary of the
Clerks’ Union), he has to get his sup-
Dob Hawke... success(or)?


port mainly from the Left. The Com-
munists and their supporters, in turn,
believe that at least in the short run
Hawke is a much better proposition for
them than the conservative Souter and
the official from the DLP-influenced
Clerks’ Union.
Hawke has immeasurably improved
his chances of the presidency by help-
ing to have Riordan replaced as the
services group representative on the
ACTU, and by having Souter face a
much more hostile executive. On a
rough count, if Albert Monk decided to
retire, the present executive would prob-
ably be almost equally divided in their
loyalties between Hawke and Souter.
The balance of power would almost
certainly lie in the hands of Monk,
which is just the way he likes things
to be. He can now freely decide when
he should retire and who is to be his
heir.
Canberra
Unique homage
FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARIANS
felt somewhat strange last week paying
homage to an Australian Prime Minis-
ter very few of them had ever met,
Stanley Melbourne Bruce.
Bruce, PM from 1923 to 1929, was
the first Prime Minister to exercise
office in Canberra, where the Federal
Parliament moved from Melbourne in
1927. But none of the 124 politicians
who paid tribute to him last week were
around in those days.
While the Prime Minister, Mr. Holt,
seemed content to outline to Parliament
Bruce’s distinguished career, Opposi-
tion Leader Whitlam grasped the
uniqueness of the situation.
Bruce, he said, was the youngest
Prime Minister since Watson (he was 39
when he assumed office), the only
Australian PM to have graduated
from an English University (or to have
rowed for one), the only Prime Minis-
ter to have practised at the English Bar
and the only Prime Minister to have
been decorated in war.
Except for Barton (Australia’s first
PM) he was the only Prime Minister
never to serve as a member of the
Opposition and the only Prime Minis-
ter to have lost his seat at the time of
his incumbency.
“So complete a fall stands as a re-
minder to all who follow or wish to
follow him of the infinite mutability
of human affairs,” said Whitlam to an
attentive chamber.
Whitlam outlined the vast changes
that have occurred in Australia since
Bruce- was Prime Minister. In those
days, he said, Australia had only half
its present population and Canberra
consisted of little more than Parlia-
ment House.
“Those who were members of the
Parliament at that time could scarcely
have expected that when the Prime
Minister of their day died one of the
first tributes should come from the
then one-year-old daughter of the
Duke of York who opened the Par-
liament, the infant who few would then
have expected to become Queen of
Australia,” Whitlam said.
The Country Party’s deputy leader,
Doug Anthony, echoed the feelings of
most members.
“I should like to be able to talk of
this man through having personally
known him,” Anthony said, “but un-
fortunately his term of office ended
before I was born.”

"Anyone's guess"
By ALAN REID
AS EX-OPPOSITION Leader, Arthur
Calwell no longer has the importance
he had. But the Labor viewpoint on
Vietnam, of which he is part, is still
very important.
Calwell has now revealed very clearly
the thinking that was behind the
Adelaide Conference decision which
laid down conditions the United States
must accept if a future Labor Govern-
ment is to keep Australian troops in
Vietnam. These conditions were (1) an
end to the bombing of Vietnam (2)
recognition of the National Liberation
Front as a principal at the negotiation
table and (3) reduction of allied effort
to a holding war.
In a dispatch from London to “Fact,”
official organ of the Left-wing Vic-
torian executive (whose senior dele-
gate, Mr. W. Brown, moved the Viet-
nam resolution at the Adelaide con-
ference), Mr. Calwell wrote: “In its
present mood the United States will
not accept any one of the conditions
a Labor Government would lay down
(before it agrees to keep Australian
troops in Vietnam).
“It (the United States) would rather
pull out altogether and if it does this
it will abandon its entire Asian Com-
munist containment policy, and most
of its Pacific Ocean bases including
Okinawa and Taiwan.
“It will resume its policy of isola-
tion.”
This analysis shows the disregard for
the continuance of the Australian-
United States alliance that Labor
under Calwell showed so clearly at
the last Federal elections and which
electorally cost them so dear.
There is no doubt that if Australia
pulled out unilaterally in Vietnam it
would endanger the Australian-United
States alliance. If such pulling out went
further and contributed to the United
States abandonment of its Asian con-
tainment policy and isolationism, the
ANZUS Pact under which Australia is
guaranteed both United States protec-
tion and (if Secretary of State Rusk is
to be believed) a nuclear umbrella, will
not be worth the expensive paper on
which it is printed.
Through Calwell’s dispatch comes
the “give-it-a-go” attitude, even if it
means that Australia exists along on the
periphery of an Asia threatened with
the restlessness of Mao’s China, which
is the hallmark of the anti-United
States Labor wing.
Wrote Calwell: “What happens
(after the United States retreat into
isolationism) is anyone’s guess. But it
will not necessarily mean a victory for
Chinese Communism.
“China at the moment is in the
throes of revolution and the overthrow
of Mao would increase Russian in-
fluence throughout all Asia. Russia’s
policy, east and west, is that of peaceful
co-existence and it is working well.”
The contradiction in this approach
which demands that the United States
gets out of Asia because it is a non-
Asian power, but is tolerant about
Russia, also non-Asian, filling the
power vacuum created by United
States withdrawal apparently goes un-
noticed.

THE GAME ‘DAME’
By MICHAEL RAMSDEN
TO WATCH Dame Pattie slip past the
columned family home of Mrs. Jac-
queline Bouvier Kennedy gives the
feeling that that lovely yacht is a per-
manent part of the scene at Newport,
Rhode Island. The mansions of the
multi-millionaires along the rocky ocean
front and a costly sea-going thorough-
bred and her uniformed crew are quite
compatible.
As far back as last century, the Van-
derbilts and the Rockefellers gazed out
on similar sights, and their children
must have watched the Shamrocks of
Sir Thomas Lipton put to sea time and
again in quest of yachting’s most
precious prize. So it’s hard not to feel
at times that we’ve got a cheek expect-
ing to upset the plush Newport equilib-
rium in a boat which next month can
be chopped up for firewood for the mob
at Woolloomooloo, if designer Warwick
Hood has been correctly quoted. The
Dame is beautiful, all right. But she
was built for one job, and one only—
to win four of seven races for the
America’s Cup in the challenge which
begins September 12.
Australian accents float across the
water as skipper Jock Sturrock raps out
orders to his wild colonial boys, who
would like nothing better than to see
the American aristocracy lining Sydney
Heads for a return bout once the
coveted Cup was wrested. On the eve
of Australia’s second bid for “Auld
Mug” (Sir Thomas’ phrase for the elu-
sive trophy), can we expect to see it
happen? If we can, American yachting
buffs, who have almost completely re-
covered from the. shock Australia’s
Gretel gave them in ’62, would see it
as a nowadays unbelievable log-cabin
to White House success story.
Any one of them who had seen the
Dame’s humble beginnings would back
them up. Only a year ago, she was.
taking shape in a weatherboard boat-
shed perched on the side of Sydney’s
Berry’s Bay, looking out over oil stor-
age tanks and terrace houses across the
water at Balmain, and near wire-mesh
swimming baths whose beaches are lit-
tered with harbor debris.
They’d see the “No Trespassers” sign
and the glare from the red-haired man
in the blue overalls and sandshoes, and
perhaps wouldn’t know (like some of
‘us do) what superb skill was being built
into that graceful hull. They wouldn’t
know the shipwrights and apprentices
who rarely talk, even when they were
turning out the plywood surfboats which
ride the boomers so well at Bondi and
Manly.
Conversation came only at tea breaks
around a billy amid the mahogany dust
and wood shavings (below the brown
faded pictures of the over-canvased
18-footers long-gone relatives once
raced in summer nor’-easters) or in a
McMahon’s Point pub after knock-off
time. It was a far cry, down there in
Berry’s Bay, from the big-time shipyards
along the eastern seaboard of the U.S.,
used to building the boats of the
wealthy.
But now, with the moment of truth
almost here in the Millionaires’ Row
atmosphere of Newport, with a fleet of
4000 spectator craft from destroyers to
dinghies gathering to watch, there’s
little time left to add up the pluses and
minuses and guess the outcome. That
she looks the part with her light blue
hull and the golden spray of wattle on
her bow doesn’t mean anything. To
the trained eye of any serious yachtsman
who knows a good sail and deck lay-
out, she means business.
At best, the beautiful boat from
Berry’s Bay will fight a close-fought
tussle with the American defender. At
worst, there’s the nagging fear that she
will be humiliated like Britain’s Sceptre,
through no fault of her own, but merely
the incredible speed of America’s
shapely radical. It seems an age ago
when construction of the challenger was
first beginning, and I was sitting under
a tree on the grass at Bradley’s Head,
one arm in a sling from a yachting
accident, watching the Saturday
panorama.
Warwick Hood slumped down, taking
a sort of busman’s breather from the
drawing-board to watch the harbor
racing, and confided that he could
have built a faster Dame if he had been
given more time in which to plan and
tank-test new models. But he had
reached the point of no return: the
blueprints had to be handed over so
that the boat would be ready for the
men who had to learn her every whim.
He’s doubtless thinking the same thing
at the moment, but until the starting
gun fires and the big yachts head off
across the grey Atlantic swells he won’t
know if his brainchild is fast enough.
Nor will squat, crew-cut Emil (he
shares the given name with helmsman
Mosbacher) Christensen, Melbourne
ice-cream magnate and foghorn-voiced
boss of the Dame syndicate. By this
time, neither another half a million
dollars on top of that already spent,
nor the promised “wind corroborees”
by Mornington Island Aborigines, who
sent along a good-luck boomerang,
would be any help. Designer, sailmaker,
builder, and backers will have done
their bit when the starting gun goes
from that moment on it’s where
experience, instinct, and even luck take
over.
In the first of these lies the greatest
plus factors to Australia’s challenge:
some rough mental arithmetic and in
skipper Sturrock and the trio immedi-
ately around him in the Dame’s cockpit
there is something like 170 years of
sailing know-how, if you can tally such
things in such ways.
Sturrock and afterguard men Norm
Wright, Norman Booth, and Bill
Barnett were all born within a year of
each other during World War I, and
now in their early fifties have a life-
time of boats behind them. Australian
yachtsmen who know them all specu-
lated if four such individualists could
live in harmony in the close quarters of
a 12-metre yacht’s cockpit for as long
as they have, but if they expected fire-
works they’ve been proved wrong.
Possibly it is mutual respect which
has held them together (there’s every
reason for this), or perhaps it has some-
thing to do with Sturrock’s taciturn
leadership. During the series of elimi-
nation races against Gretel off the
Sydney coastline they functioned like
a well-running computer, feeding Stur-
rock vital information which helped
him to demoralise the opposition, and
although tensions will be strained to the
limit, there’s no reason why they won’t
do it again.
“Combat nerves” like the costly mis-
takes by Gretel’s afterguard, which had
her over the line a minute early in
one trial and failed to bring her back
promptly after a recall signal in an-
other, should not happen aboard the
Dame. Like any other yachtsmen,
they will get tense. “There’s Boothie,
grinning like a grey-nurse shark,” I’ve
heard one Olympic-class skipper say as
Skipper of the U.S. entry, Intrepid,
Bus Mosbacher, seems to be giving a
few hints to Jock Sturrock, skipper of
Dame Pattie, but this is hardly likely
at this stage
Booth, with a set smile, expertly swung
his Dragon-class yacht through a melee
at the start of a championship. Each
one specialises in starting. There is
none tougher ,in the business.
And in the business of 12-metre
match racing, an advantage won at the
start can give you 40 percent of the
race —often more. Sturrock himself
has devoted more than three years of his
life to racing the big “twelves,” spend-
ing 1961 and 1962 in the Gretel cam-
paign and the past 18 months on the
latest quest, commuting weekend and
midweek between Melbourne and Syd-
ney on commercial airline flights to take
his helm. But if anyone groaned to see
him come back to Newport as the
number-one man on the new challenger,
it wasn’t only his opposing helmsmen.
To the American TV and radio men,
interviewing Jock is often a nightmare.
He answers questions which are in-
variably longer than his replies, politely
and honestly but with grunts, sailing
terms, and Australianisms, which they
must find impossible to understand. If
he is shy in front of the cameras, he
is anything but when it comes to
verbally keelhauling a crewman who
has made a mistake, or a yard man who
has let him down over an item of equip-
ment, or even when it comes to telling
his syndicate they’ve got to dig deeper
into their pockets. Sturrock is boss
aboard the Dame.
But he’s no Captain Queeg and he
will impassively weigh advice whether
it is given aboard ship or over a beer
in the bar, where he gets enough com-
ments from well-wishers to make any-
one taciturn. But Sturrock (the em-
barrassing going-aground incident off
Newport was not his fault) is at his
finest when the sails are aloft. He has
the “killer” instinct which shows no
mercy to a rival strange words of
praise, maybe, but in match-racing a
change of wind and your foe may turn
the tables on you if you’re off guard
for a moment.
Sturrock concentrates. In a flurry
of foam at a weathermark in an Olym-
pic trial I have seen him pluck an over-
board crewman out of the water with
one hand without taking his eyes off
a setting spinnaker, and go on to win
the race. But the recent epidemic of
virulent flu has pointed up one short-
coming, which could prove serious: no
one else sails the Dame.
Sturrock has ably spun the double
aluminium wheel from her first day
afloat, with the result that there is no
relief helmsman in the event of his be-
coming ill again or even if he was to
twist a wrist on the jetty. Perhaps it’s
not worth worrying about, but rotund
Norm Wright, with only limited experi-
ence skippering the loaned American
trial horse Nefertiti, must be logical
choice to take over. Both Booth and
Barnett could also steer, and steer well,
given the chance to get the feel of the
30-ton yacht.
A Queenslander, whose bald patch
gives him, at first glance, anyway,
almost a friar-like appearance, but a
salt who likes an after-sailing rum,
Norm Wright sailed in four of Gretel’s
five races against Weatherly in ’62, fur-
ther adding to his claim as heir-appar-
ent. He is a boatbuilder (Sydney Har-
bor’s fast Customs launch is one of his)
and before becoming a successful ocean
racer was a skiff champion like Bill
Barnett.
If anyone in the Australian cockpit
should be used to the armada of spec-
tator craft it’s Barnett, favorite of the
devotees who heeled the ferries follow-
ing Sydney’s 18-footer fleet and cheered
him on. The “red man,” as they call
him, has a freckled, weatherbeaten
countenance which looks in profile like
the map of Australia turned on its side,
and until you know better seems to
have a temper to match his hair.
The skilful builder of the Dame, he
has the remarkable ability to make a
goer of any boat he steps into. World
champion in his days in the spectacu-
lar, sail-carrying eighteens, he punched
his boats hard to windward with his
characteristically aggressive action on
the tiller and was a real crowd-pleaser
as he carried big spinnakers and ring-
tails downwind.
He has been known to take off his cap-
and jump on it when he was skippering
one of his skiffs when his for’ard hand,
hard of hearing by nature or intent,,
ignored his ear-blistering exhortation
to speed-up a jibe which was going
smoothly and efficiently but not
lightning-fast enough to suit the red
feller. But there have been no signs of
temperament in the Dame’s cockpits
Certainly not from Norm Booth, a
man who loves a practical joke and is
inclined to slip a dead fish down the
back of your oilskins and laugh up-
roariously.
Instead, there are whispered confer-
ences, silent appraisal of sail-set, and
only one man at a time ever talks to
Sturrock in a quiet minimum of words-
so as not to break his concentration.
With the passing of the months, more
confidence has been earned by the rest
of the crew, some of whom were com-
parative novices in the sailing game
with the notable exception of foredeck
boss Peter (“Pod”) O’Donnell. Sixty-
five feet away, at the other end of the
ship, he is in many ways very like
Sturrock, who knows by now that things
up at the sharp end couldn’t be in more
capable hands.
Pod O’Donnell rarely says much,
but his eyes roam ceaselessly over his:
territory aboard the Dame from the
masthead to bow, and he springs into-
action like a surefooted panther. He
sailed in all the Gretel’s five races
against Weatherly, twice he has been in
winning Hobart race crews; he has raced
transatlantic and around Fastnet and
gathered a gold medal in Tokyo with
Australia’s yachting grandpa, Bill
Northam.
But even he must share the apprehen-
sion that’s general from one end of the
Dame’s deck to the other, engendered
by the awesome string of victories of
“Bus” (Emil) Mosbacher and the “Fly-
ing I.” Intrepid looks a very hard boat
to beat, and, as if they weren’t quite
capable of assessing this for themselves,
the Aussies are under fire from one of

the biggest bombardments psychological
warfare has ever known.
If they could shut off the TV and the
newspapers it would be bad enough, but
to pick up the American magazine
“Time” a fortnight ago and see how the
cover artist prophetically foresaw the
outcome was typically discouraging.
There was a smiling Mosbacher at his
helm, and hull-down astern another
“twelve” bearing sail numbers K (inter-
national code) A (for Australia) 2.
Unmistakably Dame Pattie, except that
the artist (the magazine explained edi-
torially how he’d tried to be
“authentic”) showed the Dame’s top-
sides as white instead of blue.
The Australian camp could only hope
that the “Time” cover might prove to
be a jinx, as it sometimes has in the
past. The article itself chortled over
the legendary Queen Victoria story
about the original America’s victory
(“I regret to report there is no second
yacht, madam”) rather in the spirit
that this might happen all over again,
and sportingly added that maybe Bus
would get seasick. It was enough to
make anyone’s stomach turn, but it’s
only one small example of what the
Dame’s men are having to put up with
in print.
Not undeservedly so far, Intrepid
could star on TV as Superboat. Some
cynics speak sneeringly of the Damn
Pity, a term that waterfront wiseacres
quickly dropped back in Sydney when
they saw her perform. Others are dis-
paraging about her workouts with
Nefertiti, which have certainly come
under close scrutiny, but then again
who can be sure that the Australians
aren’t capable of doing their own share
of foxing.
Victorious fellow-yachtsmen from
Australia’s Admiral’s Cup squad who
drove up from New York on their way
home from Plymouth went away tut-
tutting about the state of morale among
the America’s Cup squad. The breezy
ocean racers (you might liken them to
reliability trial men v. Warwick Farm
speedsters) had shaken Cowes Week to
its staid foundations with the deter-
mined assault after their trophy, and
their success at beating the British and
American teams at the second try was
heartening news to the Newport visitors.
But it hasn’t all been gloom and doom
by any means: there have been some
nice gestures from the rival crews, e.g.,
the kangaroo-shaped cake presented by
the beaten American Eagle crewmen on
Dame Pattie’s first birthday, while the
Australians could easily have been put
out of the running by American hos-
pitality alone, had not the curfew on
the crew been reined in a little tighter.
Salty Bill Northam, as a Gretel syndi-
cate member in ’62, used to joke that
his role was that of skipper of the
“Lecher’s Crew.” Gretel’s team to
Newport then outnumbered the Dame’s
two to one, and he reckoned he went
out nightly with the best bourbon
drinker, the best beer drinker, etc., etc.,
and while the Yanks thought they were
retaining the Cup by ironing-out the
Aussies with good cheer, he’d say his
last act as he tiptoed by in his socks
was to unlock a door—and let the real
crew out, fresh from a good night’s
sleep!
One might have imagined there was
some truth in his story when he ran
over the foot of the Newport police-
man on duty with his jazzy American
rented car, but there wasn’t. Dame
Pattie spokesman Bill Prehn was
prompt to point out that in the only
charge of its kind, the pair of crewmen
reported (“Time,” August 18, 1967) in
a bar-room fracas were no more than
interested bystanders.
There is plenty of talk about the
secret weapons (secret no longer) on
board their rival, and speculation as to
whether her revolutionary innovations
might misfire when the pressure is really
on. Her titanium-tipped mast has twice
toppled, and a busy Bus Mosbacher
has a complex helm which looks like
a Heath Robinson design. He will have
to be certain as it is adjusted in
the heat of battle if he is trimming
a trim-tab or which of her two rudders
he is turning. Again, can there be a
foul-up between the American after-
guard and her strongmen on the coffee-
grinder winches who live a troglodyte
existence below decks?
Those who have watched the re-
designed Columbia’s selection duels with
the ghost ship (Intrepid’s decks are
almost deserted) ruefully say no —that
the bugs (if any) already have been
got out. Most of the plain-sailing Aus-
tralians don’t trust gimmickry on boats,
but have been obliged to admit that
the results are impressive. They know,
furthermore, that designer 01 i n
Stephens conceived two of the three
last successful defenders and while this
is the most radical product in his 40
years at the drawing board she gives
every appearance of being a world-
beater.
It’s no news to underdog Sturrock
that he has to win the starts —to see
that the Dame hoists her skirts and sets
off at full tilt. With that initial advan-
tage, Sturrock can hope that the tur-
bulence from her 2400 square feet
of sail will prevent Mosbacher breaking
through, which could be the case if the
two boats are even relatively equal in
their speed.
But whether yachting’s holy grail can
be lifted off its pedestal in the New
York Yacht Club is a guess until the
foes cross the starting line, and even
then one must allow for freakish wind-
shifts, gear failure, and human falli-
bility. Like a pair of prizefighters in
the ring, Dame Pattie and Intrepid will
be out to size qp each other, sparring
tentatively, but looking for the chance
of delivering a KO as they manoeuvre.
In this encounter, we’ve got the
brawn —and the brains—and no one is
going to toss in the towel before it’s all
over.

KARL MARX
as you might have known him
It is 100 years this month since Karl Marx published the first volume of “Das Kapital " We commemorate this
occasion with two articles —one by Edward Crankshaw on Marxism, and one by Colin Cross on Karl Marx himself.
By COLIN CROSS
TO MEET KARL MARX must have
been an intimidating experience. He had
short legs but a massive head and body.
He wore a monocle. His manner was
imperious. To disagree with him was
to risk being swamped in-a torrent of
argument, spiced liberally with personal
abuse.
Marx lived at twice the intensity of
ordinary people. His feuds, his work,
his relaxations were on a gargantuan
scale. His idea of a country stroll was
to stride the 17 miles from Margate
to Canterbury in under four hours; that
he did while “convalescing” after an
illness when he was aged 45.
His enemies were not so much kings
and capitalists—the inexorable forces
of history would dispose of them —but
fellow-Socialists who rejected his teach-
ing. To Marx, Marxism was so blind-
ingly obvious that any Socialist who
failed to grasp it was likely to be dis-
honest. He went to enormous lengths
to discomfit his opponents.
There was Gottfried Kinkel, a Ger-
man Socialist condemned to death and
then reprieved. Kinkel escaped from
Spandau prison and burst upon the
German emigre community in London
as a figure of glamor. Marx could
not stand him and the two men ex-
changed public abuse—Kinkel accused
Marx of having been thrown out of pubs
by British workers.
Marx prepared a vituperative letter.
Then the fear struck him that if Kinkel
saw an envelope in Marx’s handwriting
he would throw it away without open-
ing it. So Marx bought stationery
ornamented with rosebuds and got
somebody else to write the address.
He then sat back to reflect on Kinkel,
who liked women, opening an appar-
ent love letter only to find a load of
abuse.
Another enemy was the dashing
Ferdinand Lassalle, who, while Marx
was scribbling in exile, actually led a
successful workers’ party in Germany.
Lassalle, who eventually died of a
bullet in the genitals from a duel over
a-17-year-old girl, gave Marx money.
But Marx was less than grateful. He
called Lassalle “the Jewish nigger” and
propounded the theory that Lassalle
was descended from Negroes who had
accompanied the Jews in the exodus
from Egypt.
Not surprisingly, Marx had few
friends. He did not mind, and to him
the social courtesies were unimportant.
In utter contrast was his warm home
life. Marx was a wonderful husband
and father, gay, loving, tolerant. The
few who saw him at home were amazed
at the contrast between his public and
private behaviour. He would spend a
whole afternoon playing with his chil-
dren on Hampstead Heath, perhaps
flying a kite, and then go home to work
far into the night on “Das Kapital.”
(His mother said she wished Karl
would make some capital instead of
writing about it.)
Harassed by duns and bailiffs, the
household was still happy. One detects
in it elements of the Micawbers. There
was the fading beauty of Marx’s aristo-
cratic wife, Jenny. There was
“Lenchen” (Helena Demuth), the ser-
vant who devoted herself to them,
often without wages, for 40 years and
is now buried with them at Highgate.
There were two sons and foui
daughters, all talented.
School fees were the top priority in
the rickety Marx finances and the chil-
dren were at the top of their classes.
One boy and one girl died while the
family was living in two rooms above
what is now the Quo Vadis restaurant
in Soho. Marx was distracted. Later his
other boy died. It was the tragedy of
his life that he lost both his sons, but
his youngest daughter, Eleanor (“Tus-
sie”), consoled his later years. She
wanted to be an actress and in her teens
modelled herself on Ellen Terry, but
instead she acted as secretary and liter-
ary assistant, to her father.
For money, Marx sponged on every-
one in sight, rarely showing gratitude.
The main source was his only real
friend, Engels.
In his own right Engels was a con-
siderable man. He would rank to Marx
as Mozart to Bach. But Engels believed
Marx possessed the best brain of the
century and accordingly gave abso-
lute allegiance. Indeed, only on such
terms was it possible to be Marx’s
friend.
The common legend is that Engels
was a rich capitalist who could well
afford to finance the Marx family. Cer-
tainly Engels’ family owned a part share
in a cotton mill. In fact, however, for
many years Engels worked at the mill
at only a clerk’s salary. From his modest
earnings he took pound notes, snipped
them in halves, and posted them to
Marx in separate envelopes. He was
afraid that if he sent the precious ob-
jects whole they might get stolen.
Most of his time Marx worked. But
when he decided to have fun, he did
it with equal thoroughness.
There was a heavy pub crawl with
his fellow exiles Wilhelm Liebknecht
and Edgar Bauer. They decided to have
a drink in every bar between Soho and
the Hampstead Road.
About halfway up the Tottenham
Court Road they found a pub contain-
ing a gathering of Oddfellows. Marx,
well away, gave them a speech on the
beauties of German music. Then Lieb-


knecht spoilt things by announcing that
German politicians were corrupt as
corrupt as English politicians. This
latter point was too much for the Odd-
fellows and the trio of exiles were
virtually thrown out. Disconsolately,
they revenged themselves on the Eng-
lish by smashing the Tottenham Court
Road street lamps. Then, in sudden
fright, they ran back home to Jenny in
Soho.
Although he lived more than half his
life in London, Marx was never fully at
home there. To the end, his spoken
English was ungrammatical and heavily
accented. Spiritually he was always
in exile and England was just a con-
venient country which happened to lack
immigration controls. Of course, he
based most of his thinking upon Eng-
lish industrial conditions and he re-
spected the steady, businesslike way the
British working-class leaders conducted
their affairs—and listened to his ideas.
But one suspects that those leaders,
while courteous, treated Dr. Marx with
a degree of scepticism.
When Marx died in 1883, Engels’
heart nearly broke. “The greatest brain
has ceased to think,” he said over and
over again. But only about a dozen
people attended the burial at Highgate
and Engels’ graveside speech “His
name and works will live on through
the centuries” —must have sounded like
mere panegyric rather than dispassion-
ate analysis.
Marx’s surviving children were less
than happy.
Eleanor, his favorite, went on to be-
come a leading personality in the Eng-
lish Labor movement. She taught work-
ing men, notably Will Thorne, the gas-
workers’ leader, to read and write, and
she organised the clerical side of the
1889 dock strike. She fell in love with
a science lecturer, Edward Aveling, the
original of Dubedat in Shaw’s “The
Doctor’s Dilemma.” Aveling was already
married but she lived with him and
Marx’s birthplace in Treves, Prussia
changed her name to Eleanor Marx
Aveling.
Part rogue and part brilliant pro-
pagandist, Aveling was thrown out of
various Left-wing organisations on
charges of peculation. When his wife
died he married not Eleanor but an-
other girl, although living with Eleanor.
Eventually, aged 42, Eleanor killed her-
self by swallowing prussic acid. It
was alleged that Aveling had actually
killed her. Aveling made a speech at
her funeral, which was regarded as
cheek, and, since everyone had liked
Eleanor, he was frozen out of politics.
Another daughter, Laura, came to a
similar end. She married the French
Socialist Paul Lafargue and inherited as
her share of Engels’ fortune £7OOO.
She and her husband divided the money
into ten equal parts, lived on it for ten
years, and when it had gone calmly
killed themselves.
Marx’s only living descendants are
the Longuet family in France, into
which his third daughter, Jenny,
married.
Karl Marx’s last move was as
recently as 1956. For years, world
Communists had been dissatisfied with
the humble condition of his grave,
There was even talk of his being moved
to Moscow. Finally, funds were raised
Marx’s wife, Jenny ... “the most
beautiful girl in Treves”
by international subscription for a new
grave. Marx and his family were dug
up and moved to a new site in a higher,
more commanding position at Highgate
cemetery. To them were added
Eleanor’s ashes, which previously had
been kept at the headquarters of the
British Communist Party. Over them
was erected the present glowering bust,
the symbol of the “greatest brain.”
So Marx ends as Britain’s major
magnet for the attraction of the rouble
tourist trade.
MARXISM
The first 100 years
By EDWARD CRANKSHAW
MARXISM IS A MOVEMENT un-
paralleled in secular history, which, in
100 years, has turned the world upside
down. Yet the general picture of Marx
himself is vague and sketchy in the ex-
treme, and his teaching in all its breadth
has never been codified or copcisely de-
fined.
During his own lifetime Marx quar-
relled incessantly with his fellow-
revolutionaries; all who were not wholly
for him were against him. After his
death in 1883 and until the triumph
of Lenin there was also incessant and
virulent disagreement among the Social
Democrats of Europe as to the true
meaning and the proper application of
the Master’s teaching. The Russian
Marxists, a minority party among the
Russian revolutionaries of every color,
quarrelled with the German Marxists
and no less bitterly among themselves.
In 1903 they split irretrievably into Bol-
sheviks and Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks
conquered and Lenin incorporated
Marxism into the secular Russian
national tradition.
It was thus Leninist-Marxism which
held the field, challenged only ineffec-
tively until the Chinese revolution of
1948. Now China, also claiming Lenin
as their prophet, offers the Mao version
of Marxism as the only true faith. Mos-
cow is put on the defensive and the
Soviet leaders are accused of mortal sin..
And the scene is further confused by
the intrusion of yet other Marxisms,,
all claiming Lenin as the prophet.
One day, indeed, Marxism may be
anglicised; one day perhaps American-
ised. For it seems highly likely that the
appalling social convulsions presided
over in the name of Marx by Lenin and
Mao Tse Tung will, one day, be seen
as mere episodes in the history of a
secular religion which will, in some of
its tenets, outlive all other political
creeds of our day. The heroes of Marx-
ism come and go. The obscure, can-
tankerous figure of the founding father,
fretting and fuming away his life in the
wretchedness of exile in Paris, in
Brussels, above all in London, remains.
He was the father of revolution, and
thus of our revolutionary age; but, para-
doxically, some of the essentials of his


doctrine have deeply influenced the very
societies he sought to overthrow. We
are, in many important respects, all
Marxists now.
“Capital,” a life work, the first
volume of which was published six-
teen years before Marx died, has been
called the bible of the working-class;
but the workers, with rare exceptions,
have never read their bible. They would
not be much wiser about Marxism as
such if they had though far better
instrumted about economics. The full
canon of Marxist teaching is not con-
tained in “Capital.” It is not contained
in any single book. It is scattered
through the writings of a lifetime, never
neatly packaged, never defined and
pulled together.
In this sense it is a muddle; but in
the protean muddle is the strength of
the myth. For Marxism is all things to
all an odd condition for the fruit of
one of the most dogmatic minds in
history. It is full of contradictions, so
that each may find in it what he needs
as, indeed, is the Bible itself. It
invokes scientific method loudly and in-
cessantly: yet Marx was certainly no
scientist.
Why, then, in what was supposedly
a rational century, were men satisfied
with what purported to be a rational
and scientific explanation, or system-
atisation, of the workings of history
which was very far from scientific?
The answer, surely, is that the
19th century was not rational at all:
it was, indeed, an age of anti-reason.
It was an age of boundless and un-
founded optimism, of a belief in in-
evitable human progress. Marx was to
social science something similar to
what Darwin was to biology. Darwin
did not say that his theory of evolu-
tion meant that, one day, there would
be a human Utopia; but he provided
some scientific and theoretical basis for
those who wanted to believe in the de-
velopment of the human animal into
a terrestrial angel. Marx, less of a scien-
tist than Darwin, was himself seized
with a vision of the perfectibility of
man and dug. deeply and widely into
history and economics to discover the
laws which must govern this advance
to perfectibility.
He could argue like a rabbi. This
is not surprising, since he came of a
long double line of rabbis —German
on his father’s, Dutch on his
mother’s side. And the thing to grasp
about him is that he was not first an
economist, not first a historian, not
first a social scientist, not first even a
theoretician. He was all these. But first
and foremost he was an apocalyptic
visionary.
He did not seek the truth. He knew
it: it was revealed to him, to him alone.
He toiled among books, he debated,
he split hairs, he quarrelled, he suf-
fered not to uncover the truth and
follow where it led, but to find the
means to support his revealed truth
with rational theory and historical fact.
His (somewhat anti-evolutionary)
truth was that mankind, in the rough
struggle for economic survival, had be-
come degraded and alienated from its
true nature, and that only when this
struggle should cease would humanity
discover its true nature. The struggle
would not cease until there were no
more class divisions, no more situations
in which one section of the community
exploited others. And the only way to
do away with class divisions was to
fight the age-old class war through to a
finish, until the masses of the oppressed
would come into their own and sweep
away in violence the last exploiting
class.
This ultimate exploiting class was
the product of what appeared to Marx
to be the final industrial revolution (he
thought in terms of steam, not oil or
nuclear energy). Its defeat would in-
augurate an infinite era of classless
First edition of “Das Kapital”...
few workers read their bible
harmony and concord. On this day,
man at last would be himself; history
would begin; all that went; before would
belong to pre-history.
Either one believes in this sort of
dream or one does not. Many have
believed in it; many still do. There
is no doubt that this bearded German
savant of genius, Marx, was himself
possessed by this dream: everything
else was secondary. And so immense
was his erudition, so vigorous his debat-
ing power, so virile and penetrating his
mind, that he came to be thought of
not as an extraordinary mixture of
dreamer and impatient man of action
(which he was) but as a rational
philosopher (which he wasn’t). Hence,
profound confusion.
Others, before Marx, of course, had
been stirred by the dream of universal
social justice and saw the supreme evil
in private property and the accumu-
lation of wealth by the few. Saint-
Simon, Louis Blanc, the English mill-
owner Robert Owen (in 1827 the first
man to call himself a Communist or
Socialist; the words were then inter-
changeable). “Property is theft!” ex-
claimed Pierre Joseph Proudhon, and
Marx echoed him. But Marx went on
to explain how the theft had come
about, how the system of nationwide
larceny worked and, also inevitably,
how it would come to an end.
His main instrument, or tool, was the
dialectical method of the 18th-century
German philosopher Hegel, who em-
ployed his metaphysics to justify,
among other things, monarchy, particu-
larly the Prussian monarchy, and to
glorify the State at the expense of
the individual. Hegel taught that the
development of all Being (which in-
cluded Mankind, Nature, and God)
travelled by a zigzag path, which led
ever upwards: the affirmation of a
positive, its contradiction by its own
negation, and then the synthesis of
positive and negative on a higher plane;
then, further affirmation, further nega-
tion, further synthesis, in a sort of cos-
mic mountain climb the whole uni-
verse not static, but in a constant state
of becoming.
Here is the “thesis, antithesis, syn-
thesis” of the Marxists, with God left
out and mankind striving over, up-
wards, and forwards. But instead of
Hegel’s Idea (a concept woolly in the
extreme) as the dynamo of the system,
Marx substituted as its driving force
economic necessity.
Those who, at any given period, con-
trolled the means of production called
the tune. The legal, political, cul-
tural, and religious systems of that
period were all part of the apparatus
whereby the ruling class sought to pro-
tect and preserve its ascendancy. But
the rulers themselves were possessed
by the system they had developed in
their own interest. “The method of
production in material life determines
the general character of the social, poli-
tical, and spiritual processes of life.
It is not the consciousness of men that
determines their being, but, on the
contrary, their social being which deter-
mines their consciousness.”
New technical discoveries are made,
the methods of production improve, new
demands are created; but then the old
ruling-class, entrenched in habits and
its own taboos, is unable to respond to
change. By its very success, it has
created new problems which it is un-
able to solve: it is defeated by its
opposite, its negation a new class,
arising in social upheaval, to supersede
it. The res l ltant new regime is the
synthesis. This is progress.
The ruling class of 19th-century
capitalists Marx called the bourgeois.
They had been brought into being as
the entrepreneurs of the industrial re-
volution. In the process, they des-
troyed the power of the landed gentry.
But the capitalist bourgeois were them-
selves calling into being a vast class
of workers, a proletariat, the fruits of
whose toil they diverted to their own


use, and who, driven to desperation by
the misery of their lot, would, in their
turn, rise to destroy the capitalists and
would wrest from them the means of
production.
Marx then set out to demonstrate,
with a mass of detail, the then con-
ditions of the workers, and to prove'
his thesis. In so doing he threw off
almost as byproducts many phrases
which have passed into our own con-
temporary thought and understanding
—e.g., the theory of surplus value.
Everyone knew that workers were ex-
ploited. Marx gave them an explana-
tion of the system whereby mill-owners
and steel-masters flourished while their
workers shivered and sometimes starved.
He gave them more: he gave them a
slogan and a war-cry.
The war-cry to him' was most real.
His ambition, which first showed in
his dream of being a great poet, was
boundless. The millenium was at hand,
and he, Karl Marx, was to preside
over its birth-pangs. So while by day
he read and brooded, by night he
planned and conspired.
The capitalist system was ripe for
downfall. His idealistic young friend,
Friedrich Engels, working in his father’s
business in Manchester and enthusiastic-
ally riding to hounds, privately was
plotting against the system which gave
him his wealth. He supplied Marx with
the evidence he needed, with first-hand
stories of the degradation of the Man-
chester poor. British Government Blue
Books were a rich source of statistics.
It was the heyday of Victorian factory
inspectors, whose revelations led Parlia-
ment to pass the Factory Acts.
Marx held these men in great respect,
although minions of a capitalist govern-
ment. He could not afford to buy the
Blue Books as they came out; he had
an arrangement to buy copies cheap
from the contractor who carted off to
destruction unread copies distributed to
Members of Parliament. Perhaps it was
he, more than any other man except
Lord Ashley, later the Earl of Shaftes-
bury, who understood and profited most
from these compilations. “Capital”
itself, the whole of it written in London,
was a monument to the labor of these
obscure and incorruptible Victorian
officials.
But Marx, unlike Lord Shaftesbury,
set no store by parliamentary action, or
the principle of gradual amelioration
although it was, in fact, already begin-
ning to operate through the growing
social conscience, to say nothing of the
deep instinct of self-preservation dis-
played by the capitalist exploiters, who
were to prove clever at avoiding revolu-
tionary situations. Gradualism was not
the way the grand dialectic worked;
revolution, not evolution, was to be the
order of the day. And it was his, Marx’s,
job to emerge from his study, from the
womb-like recesses of the British
Museum Reading Room, to organise it.
Revolution was, indeed, in the air.
In 1848 the whole continent of Europe,
which had been recently overrun by the
revolutionary armies of France, was
again briefly on fire. In Vienna, the
Emperor abdicated and Metternich fled
to Brighton. In Dresden, the gigantic
and beloved Russian anarchist Bakunin
proclaimed a new dawn: and the com-
poser Richard Wagner was among his
admirers. Paris exploded in street fight-
ing.
The year 1848 saw Marx’s most
influential utterance, the Communist
Manifesto: .“A spectre is haunting
Europe the spectre of Communism
. . . Workers of the world unite! You
have nothing to lose but your chains!”
Marx, soon after this declaration, had
slipped back into Germany, but soon
had to flee again as the many small
revolutions there fizzled out and gave
way to reaction.
Marx was now back in London for
good. He made his headquarters in
Great Windmill Street, where he oper-
ated, through the Communist League
and the International Workingmen’s
Association, the First International. He
toiled away at “Capital.” But. most of
The Communist Manifesto of 1848...
“nothing to lose but your chains”
his writings, as in the past, were the
direct, ad hoc responses of a political
conspirator to an immediate situation.
Indeed, the only way to make sense of
Marx’s writings is to see them as active
pamphleteering.
His vision was fixed when he was very
young; he never lost it and he never
added to it. But his teachings, the body
of his doctrine, were called into being
by the need to sustain the vision and
defend it against all comers particu-
larly against dissenting revolutionary
friends and rivals.
It was not, for example, until the
very end of his life that he, quite
casually, committed himself to a view
of what would happen after a successful
revolution. Then in his “Critique of the
Gotha Programme,” a scathing attack
on Karl Liebknecht and other German
revolutionaries who were not arranging
matters as he thought they should, he
threw out the remark: “The question
then arises: what transformation will
the State undergo in a Communist
society? . . . Between capitalist and
Communist society lies the period of
revolutional transformation of the one
into the other. There corresponds to
this also a political transition period in
which the State can be nothing but the
revolutionary dictatorship of the prole-
tariat
Upon this sentence, delivered to irri-
tate a rival, the whole immense appara-
tus of repression, the Leninist-Stalinist
State, was subsequently to be raised.
It is fascinating to watch the develop-
ment of this genius, hpw he “found him-
self” after the shakiest possible start,
and to contemplate the remarkable dis-
proportion—pathetic or heroic, comic
or tragic, as one looks at it—between
his great mental powers and the limited
means and resources then at his disposal
for transforming his vision into action.
No start could have been much more
unpromising. As a youth, a student,
and a young man, he was the despair
of his father, a lawyer. Karl was bril-
liant, but idle to an extreme degree.
He not merely failed his examinations;
he shirked them altogether. He ran
into debt and perpetually sponged. He
was a caricature of the shiftless adoles-
cent cafe-philosopher of the European
scene of that period.
He liked good clothes. He lied about
his work. To complicate matters, at
16 he fell in love with his sister Sophie’s
friend. Jenny von Westfalen, “the most
beautiful girl in Treves.” She was the
daughter of a high Government official
and minor aristrocrat, whose wife
boasted the improbable blood of the
Scottish Dukes of Argyll. She called
him ‘.‘the Moor,” and so, later, did all
his close friends, because he was so
swarthy, with jet-black hair and beard,
black eyes, a powerful physique sup-
ported by legs a little too short.
Behind the shaggy hair and beard the
forehead and nose were imperiously
strong: clean-shaven he might have been
a Renaissance cardinal. He had no in-
terest in his contemporaries. He fre-
quented the company of men older than
himself and extracted all their know-
ledge and experience of the world—
until he had sucked them dry, when
he would discard them. He was accep-
ted into a neo-Hegelian intellectual
circle and philosophised endlessly over
beer and tobacco (he always drank too
much and smoked to excess). He was
going to be a poet. He did no work
at his universities, but wrote reams of
poetry and poetic dramas until his
father came to the conclusion that he
would never make a lawyer and had
better follow his own bent.
But at this point Marx himself sud-
denly realised that he was not a poet
at all: all his poetry was empty rhetoric
and vain metaphor. It was not the first
time that a young man who thought
he was another Shakespeare suddenly
discovered that he was not. The normal
thing then is to forget about genius
and settle for a humdrum career. Marx
was not normal: he was a genius but
he was a genius in a void. So he raised
a great outcry. It was the end of the


world. All his life had been in vain.
What to do?
Very well, he would be a great
philosopher, an academic. To this end
he still sponged relentlessly on his
parents. But this could not go on for
ever. Further, his revisions of Hegel
had begun to interest him in reforming
the State—but not via Socialism; he
still despised Socialists. The first thing
was to do away with God and then to
work for the improvement of the State
on rational and, indeed, authoritarian
lines. He became so obsessed with
atheism that he made Germany too hot
to hold him. His first exile had nothing
to do with Socialism or Communism,
which he had promised to purge from
the pages of the “Rhenish Gazette”
when the editorship fell into his lap
at the age of 24. It had to do with
atheism and general subversiveness.
He went to Paris. He was 26. He had
at last married Jenny and was living on
her mother. In Paris, he met his future
disciple, Engels, who was full of the
miseries of the English working-class.
In Paris, he became infected with
socialistic ideas. In Paris, he had his
moment of revelation when he dis-
covered that the principle behind the
Hegelian dialectic was nothing less,
nothing more, than economic necessity.
His course was now set.
He was still a genius not a poet,
not an academic, not a radical jour-
nalist but the arch-priest of a dogma,
the prophet of a revolution, the founder
of a secular religion. He became in-
volved in Weitlin’s League of the Just,
a society for preaching Socialism to
German refugees in Paris. Already, such
was his ambition, such his impatience,
such his intellectual arrogance, that he
was aspiring to the leadership of the
German revolutionary movement.
Already he was notorious for the
savagery and bitterness of his attacks
on his opponents, as often as not his
earlier patrons and allies. He captured
the League of the Just. Poor Weitlin
was hounded out of Paris.
Marx was a man possessed. He
fought not to find truth but to force
acceptance of his own revelation. He
labored and read to the same end.
He suffered, so did his family. Ex-
pelled from Paris, expelled from
Brussels, expelled again from Germany,
he came to London—by now as poor
and persecuted as other founders of
religions have been.
One child was sick, soon to die, and
Jenny was pregnant again. Jenny’s
brother was now very grand, nothing
less than the Prussian Minister of the
Interior; but poor Jenny herself, with
her pale aristocratic features, lived in
squalor in the train of a professional
revolutionary, whose tiny earnings from
journalism were supplemented by pre-
sents from Engels and anyone else he
could touch. They were driven out of
their first rooms in Chelsea and were
lucky not to be sold up.
“Two bailiffs came into the house,”
wrote Jenny, “and took possession of
all belongings—bedding, clothes, every-
thing, even the baby’s cradle and the
little girl’s toys, so that the children
wept bitterly. The bailiffs threatened
to take everything away in two hours.
If this had happened, I should have had
to lie on the floor, with my freezing
children beside me, and with my aching
breasts.”
But they loaded their bits and pieces
on a handcart, under the eyes of an
interested crowd, and hunted for lodg-
ings. In the end they finished up in
two furnished rooms in Dean Street,
Soho. The baby, in convulsions,
screamed endlessly.
Marx went on working. The head-
quarters of the Communist League and
of the International Workingmen’s
Association in Great Windmill Street
took much of his time. This strident
and virulent polemicist showed himself
the most patient and lucid teacher to
those who would listen without argu-
ing. Those who disagreed were knaves
or fools, most probably knaves. Some-
times they had nothing to eat for days
except bread and potatoes. But even
in this desperate time Marx could be
kind and genial to his disciples.
He was working now in the new
Reading Room at the British Museum,
and he went on working there when,
after useful windfalls in 1855, the family
moved to Hampstead—to 9 Grafton
Terrace, Maitland Party, Haverstock
Hill. “Compared with the holes in the
wall where we lived, it is magnificent,”
wrote Jenny, “and although all the
furniture cost no more than £4O, our
new house at first seemed princely. Our
linen and the remains of our former
splendor were redeemed from the pawn-
shop, and once again I joyfully counted
the damask table-napkins which are
heirlooms from Scotland. We were so
happy again in our bourgeois pros-
perity.”
But soon they were pawning again.
There were times when Marx could
not go out because his suit was in
pawn. “My wife” (the most beautiful
girl in Treves) “cries all night and that
infuriates me. I am sorry for her. The
heaviest burden falls on her, and fun-
damentally she is right. But you know
of old that I have very little patience,
and that I am even somewhat hard.”
They battled through. He went on
working, quarrelling, feuding. He was
encouraged and partly supported by
the indefatigable Engels, who wrote
many of his articles for him: he re-
ceived for them £1 a time from the
radical New York “Herald.” At last
he completed his first major opus, born
in immediate and often futile contro-
versy, “The Critique of Political
Economy,” which first set out his theory
of labor value. He was a fully fledged
economist at last. But nobody at the
time noticed the book.
He ploughed on tirelessly with his
reading for “Capital.” He seemed to
have the constitution of an ox. His
human side, we see best in Liebknecht’s
memoirs. His delight in children, his
great laugh, his furious smoking and
beer drinking. All day in the British
Museum, all the evening teaching or
beating opponents over the head in
Great Windmill Street, home for talk
and beer—then more work into the
night. And, on Sundays, memorable
and jolly excursions to Hampstead
Heath with Lenchen, their ever-faithful
servant-confidante, the children, Lieb-
knecht and other exiled revolutionaries,
their eye on Lenchen’s food basket;
searches for flowers; long, boisterous
games with the children. Then the
homeward march, back to work and
duty.
The constitution began to break
down. He was Job: he came out ia
boils, dreadfully painful. His liver began
to fail. By 50 he had worn himself out.
And there were still nine years to go
before the first volume of “Capital”
was published. And now, as he moved
toward his apotheosis, he began to lose
hope of the revolutionary movement he
was so determined to rule. There were
no revolutions. He looked for them
everywhere, even in unlikely Russia. It
did not matter whether they were prole*
tarian revolutions, so long as heads fell..
He looked for wars to produce revolu-
tionary situations; he welcomed those
that came. When Germany was fighting
—against Austria, against France—his
letters and articles were queer mixtures-
oj apocalyptic prophesies and delight in.
' German power.
He died in misery. Jenny had gone-
before. The younger revolutionaries
were having ideas of their own. They
kept what they needed of Marx, but
they were impatient with the man who
seemed to put the destruction of other
revolutionaries above all other causes.
Triumphantly, he saw Bakunin come
to nothing. He did his best to destroy
Lassalle. He attacked almost with his
dying breath the once adoring, still
deeply respectful Liebknecht. They
seemed to be moving on without him.
But he had given them their light,
and this flickered on for 30 years after
his death, and then burst in a cosmic
explosion.
He had given what modern men of
an apocalyptic cast of mind most
needed: rational grounds for a political
dream, hitherto insubstantial in its hopes
and emotionalism. He had given their
dream a cutting edge. With his doctrine
of class-hatred and violence harnessed
to the noble ideal of achieving a peace-
ful new order on earth, he appealed
simultaneously to the constructive and
the destructive drives in mankind.
He had, like that other revolution-
ary thinker, Sigmund Freud, struck out
great sparks of truth, and these still
light the way for those who know how
to use them. This was his genius. But
he tried to systematise his truth into
an all-embracing whole, leaving noth-
ing unexplained. Did he himself be-
lieve he had succeeded? It seems im-
probable. Others, later, did.

WILL NEW ZEALAND
TURN TO JAPAN?
By MICHAEL BAUME
FORGET ALL THAT seventh State
stuff. New Zealanders are very unim-
pressed indeed about the thought of
joining with Australia. Some of them
don’t even like doing business with us;
they reckon the Japanese give them a
better go. Apart from the modicum
of comfort that our defence forces
(and ANZUS) seem to give them, New
Zealanders don’t see us as their brothers
across the sea, their European partners
in an Asian setting. Instead, they think
of us as those “bloody Aussies” (they
really do call us Aussies) who are not
doing as much as we should to help
New Zealand in her hour of need,
who, because of unfair tariffs, are not
buying more of the things New Zealand
produces, and who are interested in
New Zealand simply as a place where
we can unload as many Holdens and
other manufactured goods as we can
and take as little back in exchange as
possible.
Not even the prospect of a real crisis
in exports (the current disaster is only
minor compared with what could hap-
pen if Britain joined the Common
Market without getting adequate safe-
guards for New Zealand) is enough to
make New Zealanders consider the
idea of joining Australia even as a last-
ditch proposition. Most seem to prefer
the thought of sinking on their own
than staying afloat with Australia.
Anyway, they reckon, despite their
temporary problems, they will end up
well off once the world realises it
needs New Zealand, that the material
things the Australians have in greater
volume than New Zealand have been
bought at the cost of economic coloni-
sation by America (they don’t like
capital inflow very much), that their
welfare system is too important to be
risked by even thinking of linking with
a country as “backward” as Australia
in welfare, that, in the long term, New
Zealand will turn out to be a better
and happier (if not richer) place to
live than Australia and that the dif-
ferences between the two countries are
too big to bridge, even if they wanted
to —and they don’t.
The 2£ million people who live in
these small, green, superphosphate-
covered islands are quite happy about
lacking any real industrial workforce.
They are a nation of middle-class
people with middle-class aspirations and
middle-class accents. They are true
conservatives, suspicious of the unusual,
defensive of their established institu-
tions, fearful of the “rough and tough”
attitudes they see in Australians. They
enjoy the paternalism of the State,
which, even at its most oppressive,
provides a comfortable and settled pas-
ture in which New Zealanders can graze
without too many thoughts about what
is in the next paddock.
True, some of them do wonder about
the next paddock; the migration rate
to Australia is quite high (some Aus-
tralian newspapers seem to have more
New Zealanders than Australians on
their staffs). But it is probably no more
than a blown-up version of the lure of
the big city to the boy from the bush.
Australia does seem a bit naughty and
exciting—when you’re in New Zealand.
There are, of course, a few dedicated
“unionists” and, until a couple of
months ago, they were at least given a
polite hearing. Relations between Aus-
tralia and New Zealand seemed to be
riding on the crest of a wave. Earlier
this year, New Zealanders were smiled
at by Harold Holt. At last they felt
loved by Australia. And then there was
the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) that promised so
much; under it Australia was to cut
down those offensive tariffs that have
prevented so many New Zealand pro-
ducts from selling in Australia.
But Harold Holt’s good work has all
been undone. New Zealanders have re-
discovered their basic views and crystal-
lised their dislike for the whole idea
of getting closer to Australia since they
were exposed a few months ago to Mr.
McEwen in one of his less subtle
moments. In a “friendly” visit across
the Tasman, he ruined it all when, in
reply to a question in a television
interview in New Zealand, he said,
fairly bluntly, that Australia had signed
the trade agreement with New Zealand
because it expected to get something out
of it, and clearly indicated that altru-
ism was not his long suit. This news
that the agreement was not simply the
consequence of Australian love of New
Zealand was shattering; New Zealand
was quite happy to have the quid, but
was very cross indeed about the pro quo
part, especially when the realities of
international negotiations were stated
quite so crudely.
“In one moment on television, Mc-
Ewen undid all the good that Holt had
done,” a New Zealand accountant com-
plained to me. (In New Zealand even
the accountants are kindly people.)
“Even if what McEwen said were true,
it was a very unfriendly way to say it.
We always had thought Australians
were a bunch of McEwens until Mr.
Holt was so charming. Now we’re back
to the old view.”
This feeling of hurt rejection even
seems to have affected politicians and
officials, who could hardly pretend to
have been really taken in by Happy
Harold. Even the Minister for Trade
and Deputy Prime Minister, the urbane
and able J. R. Marshall, talks in a
fairly unfriendly away about Australia
—and he is married to one of us.
“You really ought to be aware in
Australia that New Zealand, your big-
gest market for manufactured exports,
is now at risk,” he told me. “If Tasman
Pulp fails in its battle with Australian
Paper Manufacturers on liner board and
pulp, then NAFTA fails. And if
NAFTA fails, there will have to be a
change in policy that would no doubt
deprive Australia of its preferential
position in the New Zealand market.”
It is pretty clear who would get the
market instead —Japan.
The rights and wrongs of this Tasman
Pulp-APM fight are involved and un-
clear: the facts are simply that a
straightforward commercial dispute has
turned into an international one with
the New Zealanders saying quite seri-
ously that they will get out of NAFTA
unless the Australian Government pre-
vents APM from scoring a tactical vic-
tory over Tasman Pulp (which happens
by the way to be half-owned by the
New Zealand Government).
Even if NAFTA proves a success (at
present about half the trade between
Australia and New Zealand is due to
end up duty-free under it, with more
products soon to be added to this list),
few New Zealanders see it as likely to
lead to any closer links with Australia.
Not even joint marketing efforts seem
to find much favor with New
Zealanders, who would rather com-
pete with us for sales in foreign markets
than do deals with us.
They complain, too, that Australians
raid their markets. For example, after
a massive marketing effort they man-
aged to upgrade the image of lamb
in Canada and on the U.S. West Coast
so that it lost its “suspect” status and
became an acceptable meat. Now they
accuse Australians of coming in with
an “inferior” lamb at lower prices, thus
jeopardising the whole thing.
Most, then, seem to have given up
much real hope for NAFTA anyway.
And a lot of New Zealanders are
looking at their trade figures, seeing how
much better a trading partner Japan
is, urging that Australia and
NAFTA be dumped in favor of coming
to terms with the Japanese.

OVERSEAS
Will Mao force China to
collapse into anarchy?
THERE’S AN OLD Chinese method of
removing eyeballs with a hollow bam-
boo which, according to horror stories
reaching Hong Kong, has been resur-
rected in the vicinity of Canton in the
last couple of weeks. Gouging out eyes
and cutting off ears has apparently be-
come a regular practice. However
exaggerated, the reports of atrocities
trickling in were sufficiently convinc-
ing to suggest at least that the fighting
in some Chinese cities has been blood-
thirsty and merciless. Local travellers
tales were confirmed in Hong Kong by
a party of respectable middle-aged
German tourists from Canton who were
astomshed to find a man hanged from
the traffic lights when their bus drew
up at a crossroads. The interpreter, a
girl about 20, took it calmly, explain-
ing first that he was a bandit, and after-
wards that he was one of the political
opposition who deserved to die.
Basically, in Canton and other cities
in China, the problem seems to be that
the Army, although it has the power to
quell the disorders, for political reasons
does not dare to do so. Any military
commander who takes a firm line m
restoring order runs the risk of being
immediately accused of suppressing
revolutionaries and getting the sack
from Peking. The People’s Liberation
Army must be growing increasingly
restive under this restriction, and there
is a nice story of an Army officer who,
unable to deal with a rioting crowd any
other way, peeled off his uniform before
he fired an effort to restore order
without getting the Army into trouble,
According to a wall poster, the Com-
mUnist Party’s Central Committee
S uch as it is is adopting a desperate
method in an attempt to ensure its own
side, the revolutionary rebels, of victory,
In Kiangsi province a district corn-
mander was ordered to form a revo-
lutionary alliance and to hand out arms

Peking’s policy, according to the
“People’s Daily,” is still at the level of
urging Red Guards to co-operate with
mature and experienced cadres. Even

Peking is out of touch with reality in
the rest of warring China.
This unreality also seems to be re-
flected in the continuing campaign, po
nearer success, to demote Liu sSho
Chi as Head of State.
What the future holds for China now
seems to be narrowing to two alterna-
tives. Mao must either accept the fact
that a compromise is necessary to save
the country, not from an organised
•civil war, but from a much nastier
kind of anarchy and growing economic
disruption; or he will continue on to
the bitter end which will presumably
force an Army coup or dissolve the
country into the kind of chaos it has
not known since the ’2os and ’3os. Mao
does not look like compromising yet,
and it might take some months more of
confusion to persuade him that a com-
promise is necessary. On the other hand
he might be deluded enough to be-
lieve that, whatever the chaos now and
later, it might in the end produce
even perhaps after his death the
kind of China he would like to see.

Britain
Immigration laws
BRITAIN’S UNPLEASANTLY res-
trictive system of controlling immigra-
tion has been made very much worse
by the manner of its administration. In
particular—and this is an injustice un-
der which alien immigrants have suf-
fered for very much longer than Com-
monwealth ones —there is no right of
appeal to an independent tribunal either
when entry is refused or against an
administrative decision to deport. The
Home Secretary can now digest ' the
advice of his committee on immigration
procedures under the chairmanship of
Sir Roy Wilson, president of the indus-
trial court.
Its report, published as August holi-
daymakers on the south coast played the
game of spotting boats full of illegal
immigrants, is the first sane and humani-
tarian official document on the subject
of immigration to appear for a very long
time. It says: It is fundamentally wrong
and inconsistent with the rule of law
that power to take decisions affecting a
man’s whole future should be vested in
officers of the executive, from whose

findings there is no appeal . . . Even if,
generally speaking, justice is being done
under the present system, it is not appar-
ent that this is the case.
Other countries, like the United
States, which combine strict immigra-
tion procedures with a traditional
awareness of human rights, have intro-
duced an independent judicial inquiry
to counteract the zeal of immigration
officers. The Wilson committee recom-
mends that Britain should do likewise.
It suggests a two-tier appeal system:
an Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ap-
pointed by the Lord Chancellor, with
subordinate officials known as adjudi-
cators appointed by the Home Sec-
retary but independent of the Home
Office. These key people, available at
ports of entry, would deal directly with
appeals against an immigration officer’s
decision refusing entry (1054 Com-
monwealth citizens were so refused in
1965-66), or against deportation on
grounds of breach of condition of
entry (such as working without a
permit). A dissatisfied immigrant could
still appeal again to the tribunal.
Breaches of the Commonwealth
Immigrants Act accounted for 89 of the
253 deportation orders served on Com-
monwealth immigrants last year. The
remainder followed criminal prosecu-
tions on the recommendation of the
courts —the Home Secretary has, in
fact, accepted only 60 percent of the
courts’ recommendations. The proposed
system would abolish the power of
courts to recommend deportation, leav-
ing that to the Home Secretary direct
with appeal to the tribunal, even
where the case is one of “security.” The
Home Secretary and Parliament must
still deal with deportations that are
“essentially political.”
In one respect the committee may
have succumbed too far to the official
Home Office view. Commonwealth
citizens do not need visas; but they
may get their passports stamped volun-
tarily with “certificates of entry,” gran-
ted after the British High Commission
in their country of origin is assured of
their credentials. The Home Office and
the Wilson committee like this idea,
which reduces the risk of a grilling on
arrival unless, of course, the immi-
gration office thinks the certificate
and/or the passport is forged. But since
unpleasant grillings would anyway
supposedly be reduced by the new
methods, why erect what is in effect
another hurdle for those who do not
have certificates? No mere stamp will
deter the organisers of the rackets to
which the Pakistanis in particular are
so vulnerable. About 1000 Pakistani
and Indian illegal immigrants have en-
tered Britain by a “little-ships armada”
across the Channel during the past 18
months.
The men who mortgage their lands,
and effectively make themselves slaves
to their countrymen who can supply a
passport and a passage to Britain for
£6OO, are ignorant and desperate. Their
exploiters are supplied with cheap
labor in their Midlands restaurants,
uncomplaining tenants in their houses.

Automatic Form Alignment
You’ll never have to straighten a form again. Or roll it down or pull it back out
for that matter. You'll never hunt for a posting line, either.
That is, if you’re using an automated Burroughs accounting machine
equipped with Automatic Form Alignment. It's all very simple. You drop in
the form. It is squared up automatically. Then zips down to the correct
posting line. When the posting is done the form zips right back up for easy
removal. Think how much time this saves. Not to mention how much easier
it is and how much neater your records will be.
Automated forms handling is just one example of the many advanced
features you get witli high-speed Burroughs accounting machines. We’d

Singapore
Legal abortion
WHEN THE REPUBLIC of Singa-
pore celebrated its second anniversary
of independence, a sobering note on an
otherwise carnival occasion was an
announcement that the Government in-
tends to legalise abortion.
The official statement said that
Government hospitals would be able
to terminate pregnancies for a nominal
fee of SMS (about $ A 1.50).
“Every child born in Singapore will
be a wanted child” —said the Ministry
of Health. The statement stressed the
500 serious cases from unsuccessful
abortion admitted annually to hospital,
and suggested that at least five times
this number, less serious, went undetec-
ted. However, the real justification for
the change is to be found in the
economic necessities facing Singapore.
The elimination of illegal abortions is
being used as the Trojan Horse to intro-
duce abortion by request.
The irony in the situation is the
recent and remarkable success of the
Government’s mass Family Planning
Program, which only came into opera-
tion in January, 1966. In 1966 the crude
birthrate was brought down to 29
per thousand. In 1967 the average of
live births has been 25 percent below
the 1957 figure. Today the population
is 1.9 million. The rate of natural
increase is expected to be less than
two percent. Unfortunately, this success
by itself is not enough. Singapore’s
main threat comes from population
pressure on inadequate employment
opportunities. The Government is con-
cerned with all possible remedies.
Abortion is a matter of world-wide
controversy. There will be doctors who
refuse to operate, and mothers who
refuse operations. If abortion by re-
quest is deemed to be in the public
interest, however, there is a strong case
for the establishment of skilled and
reputable abortion clinics. If the
Japanese example is indicative (abor-
tions there are fast catching up with
live births), an extensive system of
clinics will be required—for pregnancy,
prevention is better than cure.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Getting music into the open
By DAVID SALTER
THE AVERAGE, conscientious Sydney
music-lover, who in addition to ABC
symphonic and recital series takes in
Musica Viva, privately promoted artists,
ISCM, the Leonine Consort et al., can
end up sitting through about 90 nights
of concertising per year. And what
a drag most of them are! Draughty,
bleak architectural monstrosities like
the Town Flail or the Conservatorium
with their uncomfortable seating, hid-
eous acoustics, and spartan general
facilities are only part contributors to
the misery.
What is missing is any sense of an
event. The same rows of sun-starved,
dinner-suited or gowned musicians, the
same, dreary house-lights-dim/front-
arcs-up lighting, the same (with a few,
almost predictable exceptions) conven-
tional programming, the same bored
faces which surround you at every con-
cert, and the same unimaginative
twenty-cent program with its fatuous
annotations. All the elements of ritual
and none of the associated spiritual
uplift.
By doggedly sticking to nineteenth-
century musical presentation, Sydney’s
and, I fear, Australia’s concert organis-
ers have doomed themselves to catering
for a habitual, rapidly aging and there-
fore diminishing public. True, the
ABC has its series of Youth and Prom
Concerts, but these are distinctly
separate occasions and as such have
contributed little to offset the present
malaise. The joy—as Leonard Bern-
stein would have it—of music is being
methodically, if unintentionally re-
pressed.
Until the Opera House complex is
completed, we will be stuck with the old
halls and their shortcomings. Likewise
we can only hope that the range of
music will begin to include works too
long held in silence. But we are still
left with the immediate sickness of
stagnation. The only solution seems to
be a firm yet friendly break with the
conventions.
Step One is to take a series of con-
certs out of the halls and into the open
air. Late spring and summer offer some
wonderfully mild and sunny days in
Sydney, when just sprawling on the grass
can be the most sublime of pastimes.
Why not enhance these precious hours
of relaxation with some attractive
musical accompaniment?
“It’s all been tried before” cry the
old regulars and they are partly right,
but the reason why outdoor music
petered out in Sydney during the mid-
’fifties was because its organisers failed
to recognise the distinctly different
properties it has as a medium to the
traditional concert hall performance.
To expect the standard subscription
series to be successful in the open air
is like hoping that Sir John Gielgud
will be a hit in Revue.
In the ideal open-air concert, the
only elements of the old order to re-
main would be performers and
audience. Attendance and a single
duplicated sheet giving the program
would be free, seating completely ran-
dom, and listeners should be free to
come, wander around, and go whenever
they liked. Eating, drinking, smoking,
reading, and sleeping—all natural states
in the Great Unwind—can be enjoyed
with the minimum of noise and it would
be senseless to restrict them at such a
concert.
Effective programming is, of course,
the crux of a good open-air concert.
Fortunately, better minds than ours
have been tackling this problem since
the heyday of Greek music-drama.
Many composers have written works for
outdoor performance (Handel and
Mozart are the best examples), and for
centuries there has been a history of
successful under-the-sky concertising. In
his collection of music criticism “Mon-

Theatre, Sydney.
bussy writes of the pleasure with which
he listened to a symphony orchestra
while reclining on the banks of the
Seine, a glass of burgundy in one hand
and a sausage in the other. And the
program included excerpts from Wag-
ner! If Debussy’s notoriously finicky
taste could be satisfied in an outdoor
concert, the problems of programming
do not appear so immense.
In terms of staging, the bugbear of
open-air concerts is acoustics. Perhaps
the only satisfactory method of com-
promising imbalances is to follow the
example of pop groups and amplify. If
four guitars and a set of drums can
be made to sound like the whole of
Liverpool electrocuted, surely AWA or
some other specialists in public address
amplification could transform the weedy
sound of an unaided open-air orchestra
into at least a reasonable approximation
of its concert-hall self.
Sydney has at least two possible
venues for outdoor music on the scale
proposed—Cooper Park (which has
been used for this purpose before) and
the front plaza of the Opera House.
Both are well served by public trans-
port and both are relatively free from
excessive traffic noise. While Cooper
Park is a natural, grassy amphitheatre
and is sheltered from wind, those mag-
nificent, wide steps which will eventu-
ally take patrons to the Opera House
foyer offer more regulated and economi-
cal seating. Admittedly, there will never
be any grass there, but with a few cush-
ions and rugs I can think of no more
beautiful or appropriate setting.
Unless something is done soon to
halt the atrophy which is gradually
overcoming large-scale Sydney music-
making, audiences will continue to
weaken. While a series of open-air
concerts is certainly no magic cure-all,
the interest and enthusiasm such a ven-
ture could promote might serve as the
first in a long-overdue course of treat-
ments.
Opera
Lively "Don"
By PAUL FROLICH
Don Pasquale. Donizetti. Elizabethan
Opera Company. Tivoli, Sydney.
DONIZETTI’S “Don Pasquale” is
probably one of the best operas for the
delectation of opera non-fans. It has a
simple, comprehensible story, some
catchy tunes, a small cast, and gets by
without any mayhem, on or off stage.
The current production uses a new,


modernised and at times slightly in-
appropriate English version by Stefan
Haag, its enthusiastic producer. The
story of the old man who, to his grief,
decides to take a young wife in order
to spite a disobedient heir, is primitive
enough; it is a standard plot of the
period, not unlike those of some of the
simpler Restoration comedies.
The Trust production was, on the
whole, pretty satisfactory. The orches-
tra, though hardly a first rate ensemble,
followed conductor Gerald Krug
amiably and, surprisingly, managed to
stay together. As the Tivoli’s pit is
far too small to accommodate even a
modest operatic orchestra (something
we will remain familiar with in the
Sydney Opera House/ as now re-
planned), some of the players have to
operate from boxes above and in front
of the pit, producing a curious effect of
elongated stereo for listeners in the
stalls.
The most consistent entertainer con-
cerned with this production was George
Molnar. He designed unfailingly amus-
ing sets, executed with many a delicious
detail and cleverly used on a small re-
volving stage.
Norina, the only female part, was
brilliantly sung by June Bronhill. Miss
Bronhill’s singing, even in awkward
coloratura, is quite excellent. Her act-
ing, it must be admitted, had the flavor
of musical comedy rather than comic
opera.
Norman Yemm, in the opera’s name-
part, was wholly convincing with both
his singing and good acting and he cer-
tainly deserved every laugh he got from
a delighted and responsive audience.
Ronald Maconaghie is one of the
Trust’s most consistently reliable singers
and his portrayal of Dr. Malatesta, a
reasonably rewarding baritone part, was
very good although rather lacking in
the mischief implied by the libretto.
Robert Gard, as in a previous produc-
tion, sang Ernesto. Gard’s tenor is not
large, but is sweet and pleasant, and
except for one or two brief lapses, he
sang his part very well indeed. While
the four principals sang well, the most
rewarding sections of the opera were the
ensembles, particularly the fine quartet
at the end of the second act.
Art
The Square Market
Morris Louis and Joseph Albers. Art
Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney.
THE ART GALLERY of New South
Wales has courageously bought two
works from the Two Decades of Ameri-
can Painting exhibition: Albers’ Homage
to the Square: Early Fusion, 1966, 48in.
square, for $U.5.5850 and Morris Louis’
Ayin, 1958, 98in. x 141 in. for
SU.S. 13,500. These prices are less than
what a private buyer would pay, for
there is a gallery discount and a re-
moval of certain tariff duties for works
intended for public display. For ex-
ample, Harry Seidler paid $U.5.6500
for his Albers from the American show,
but as tapestries by Vasardy and Le
Corbusier are for public display in
Seidler’s Australia Square in Sydney,
tariffs were removed.
Culturally there is no case for such
tariffs and the little the Commonwealth
gains could hardly compensate for the
fact that the laws discourage those who
might want to enrich the scene by
overseas purchases and impede gallery
dealers who despair over the formalities
of bonds and what-not entailed in im-
porting shows. When William Wright
revisited Australia with his paintings he
had to prove his was an Australian and,
apparently, not some English import in-
tent on taking the bread from the local
artists’ mouths.
The National Gallery of Victoria has
two works from the American show
under consideration: an Albers and
Helen Frankenthaler’s Cape (Province
town), 1964, 109 x 93in., listed price
$U.5.4600.
Though Albers has long been involved
in his squares —he is 79—he is part- of
the post-painterly abstract movement,
the art of detached non-involvement
that followed action-painting where the
brush-stroke was a seismograph of the
emotions. Albers presaged what Lucy
Lippard calls the art of silence, of
mimimal shapes, seeming stillness, and,
with a lot of artists, gently inflected
monotonal canvases. It is the kind of
art that has led people to restate the
message of the Emperor’s Clothes, for
to them there is so little to see and so
little “genuine” emotional rapport; but
in Louis and Albers we simply have a
perennial appearance of art for art’s
sake, a notion that has always attracted
charges of insincerity, triviality, and
preciosity. Of course, Albers and Louis
are not minimal artists, for theirs is an
evocative art and not in line with the
notions adumbrated in Malevich’s
White on White of about 1918 or Mar-
cel Duchamp’s “empty” flask of 1919
called 50c.c. of Paris Air.
Louis is a cool romantic; he shares
with Albers and Frankenthaler a deli-
cate thinness of pigment; from Franken-
thaler in 1952 he learnt what happens
when non-oily, polymer paints are used
to stain unsized canvas (canvas has to
be sized and primed because oil paint
rots it). With Louis, the pigment so
stains or “dyes” the canvas that form
and color unite and float so freely that
both seem impalpable. In Ayin, the
stains, showing like pink, yellow, pale
green, and bleached orange at the top,
fall in a smoky wave or veil, thin stain
over thin stain, until they take on a
green-brown tone full of fugitive, secre-
tive hues which give the whole paint-
ing a frail tremulousness. What in-
creases the silence and arrests the
declivity is the pausing of the paint
around multitudes of granules, which
are not immediately obvious. They
hold the eye while the whole veil be-
gins to grow opaque until one looks at
the top, which is like sunlit clouds seen
from a plane; the sombre opacity opens
up again. Louis has something of that
transitory, wafted-up appearance of
shapes than Nolan, soon to be seen in
the neighboring galleries, catches in his
African paintings.
Similar things go on in Albers’ Early
Fusion, which has, as with most of
Albers’ Homages to the Square, squares
within squares placed closer to the
bottom than to the top. Seidler’s
Impartial has so little color that it’s
a mystery how the central whitish square
pulsates and sharp corners simply melt,
as forms seem to be in a state of
perpetual crystallisation; Early Fusion
is such an elementary yet complex
fusion of melting and fixity that it
emanates a curious glow, a waxing and
waning that Albers’ book, “The Inter-,
action of Color,” 1963, can hardly ex-
plain, for some verticals stay rigid and
yet the horizontals of the same square
on the same color waver and grow in-
decisive. I must find out what happens
when an Albers is turned on its side
or upside down. Lots of other things
go on: why does the bottom boundary
of the dull green square melt into the
lemon-fawn square much more than
does the top boundary?
The point about these two most
valuable acquisitions is that, before
viewers can evaluate their aesthetic
worth, they must begin to find out
what -is going on and this might in-
volve readjusting modes of seeing—
not, however, modes of assessment. It
ought to be clear from the Louis and
Albers that size and scale are different
things, indeed, that Louis’ painting is
not a minute stain with delusions of
grandeur and that Albers’ is not a
blown-up postage stamp; as with dia-
monds there is a size that is best when
sparkle and scale are appropriately
balanced.

stick to being a critic, when he’s en-
titled to say what he likes; or, if he
insists on making films, he’d be better
advised to keep his lip buttoned about
other people’s movies.
The film tells a simple story a
young widow, afraid and ill at ease at
her loss of security, starts a love affair
with a promiscuous bachelor, but as
their involvement grows the two ex-
change points of view. Now it’s the
flirtatious man who wants marriage and
security, whereas the widow revels in
her new freedom.
“Dear John” made a moving, vital
film out of a love story no more in-
volved or unusual, but Donner fails
completely, both emotionally and intel-
lectually. There is never any com-
munication of a feeling of love be-
tween the two, or even —despite the
numerous shots of kisses and rumpled
bedding—of good, .honest lust.
Donner’s lack of humanity might be
acceptable if he showed a brilliant
grasp of the cinema medium, but the
film is technically dull as well. Straight-
forward reportage is occasionally varied
with staggering bits of irrelevance
an ice-hockey match, a TV educational
program about pregnancy, a salami
factory, a pop song which includes the
engaging line “The post-office girl came
between us.”
“Barefoot In The Park” as a slight
comedy about a newly married couple
who move into a topfloor walk-up
apartment, have minor troubles with
neighbors and tradesmen, quarrel over
nothing and make up. The plot, if you
can call it one, unrolls as effortlessly
and prettily as a bright skein of wool
but never knits itself into any interest-
ing patterns. But the cast is attractive
and the movie passes a couple of hours
quite painlessly.
Theatre
Students' marathon
By ROBERT WARD
Australian Universities’ Drama Festi-
val. Flinders Theatre and Union
Hall, Adelaide.
THE MOST OBVIOUS POINT made
by the Australian Universities’ Drama
Festival was that those universities with
or under the influence of drama depart-
ments produce the best plays. A Festi-
val tops-of-the-pops would go to New
South Wales with Halliwell’s “Little
Malcolm And His Struggle Against the
Eunuchs,” Flinders with Brecht’s “Gali-
leo,” and Sydney with Shaw’s “St.
Joan,” produced by a lecturer in drama
from New South Wales.
The Festival was, however, much
more than the sum of its best produc-
tions. Over the 12 days 14 plays were
presented, with most being followed by
a generally searching discussion.
Adelaide gave us Doris Lessing’s
“Play With a Tiger,” which displayed
an angular relationship between an
emancipated woman of literary inclina-
tions and an introspective American
free-wheeler. The problem, put crudely,
was whether both parties’ passions and
social freedoms could co-exist. It was an
awkwardly moved and plainly acted
production.
Monash presented Strindberg’s
“Crime and Crime,” and this was a
much more substantial effort. Unfor-
tunately, as the years go by, Strind-
berg’s high Nordic seriousness is becom-

Struggle Against the Eunuchs”

ing harder to take seriously. The
anguished self-deception of Maurice,
for instance, brings disbelieving laughter
from an audience.
La Trobe’s “The Diary of Anne
Frank” was compared unflatteringly
with the Reader’s Digest, and Queens-
land’s restoration comedy, “The Con-
federacy,” did not have a great amount
of style, but more than its producer
displayed when, in the discussion, he
blamed production faults on his cast.
New England presented “Everyman”
and Schisgal’s “The Typists,” with
both plays displaying polish and good
stagecraft. Melbourne’s production of
Robert Pinget’s “Clope,” in which the
main character lives on a railway plat-
form and concerns himself with
“them,” “the Travellers,” “the
Catastrophe,” was a piece of French
absurd theatre. It was well produced,
imaginatively designed, and generally
well acted.
Tasmania presented a modern Jap-
anese play, “The Lady Aoi,” by Yukio
Mishima, and an Arrabel, “The Two
Executioners,” both interesting plays,
but performed a little heavy-handedly.
The ANU production was “Gallows
Humour,” a modern American play
by Jack Richardson. This was one of
the Festival’s more polished produc-
tions, and contained the best individual
female performance, by Adrienne

tioner’s wife.
Finally, dealing briefly with the
three top productions, New South
Wales’ “Little Malcolm” was a joy
to behold. There was very little one
could fault in this comic study of neo-
Fascism among art students. It was
produced by Aarne Neeme, a student
of NIDA, and it was not only a pro-
duction of learnt techniques, but one
which showed natural producing talent.
Flinders University presented
Brecht’s “Galileo.” Production by Wal
Cherry was the Festival’s most am-
bitious. Dispensing with tabs and flats,
it was played with full lights in front
of a cement-brick, wall. The stage was
set with low platforms, screens, and
a corner mask, and the costumes were
sprayed calico. If one did have a major
criticism, it would be of the textual
cuts, which were many and often un-
fortunate, but it was a real flesh-and
blood-production.
Sydney’s “Saint Joan” must have
been produced with Brecht in mind,
being a more argumentative than
romantic version, played more wittily
off-the-cuff than seriously from the
heart.
Sunk with all hands
Kinds of reality
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Right You Are! (If You Think So),
Pirandello. Genesian, Sydney.
WHAT IS TRUTH? asks Pirandello,
in earnest, and replies. It is what you
think it is. There are as many truths
about any particular matter as there
are people concerned. There is no such
thing as the truth.
“Right You Are” is a strange mixture
of metaphysics, melodrama, and the
atmosphere of a nineteenth-century
novel of provincial life, a novel in
which everyone belongs to the Civil
Service. The setting is the drawing-
room of Signora Agazzi, wife of Coun-
cillor Agazzi. Into this familiar, uphol-
stered' world of provincial bourgeois
life, Pirandello introduces three very
disturbing characters.
They are Ponza, Councillor Agazzi’s
new subordinate, and his wife and
mother-in-law. Dressed all in black
they come from a town which was
recently devastated by an earthquake
they behave in an extraordinary
fashion. Why does Ponza’s wife never
go out? Why does "her mother visit
her every day, but never go beyond
the courtyard' of the apartment build-
ing, while her daughter remains on
her balcony five floors above? Why
does Ponza visit the mother-in-law
every day but never bring his wife?
The ladies in Signora Agazzi’s draw-
ing-room are in an agony of curiosity.
Explanations only make things
darker. Her son-in-law suffers from
a harmless but painful delusion which
she must humor, says the mother-in-law.
The son-in-law says the same of her.
Only the daughter can provide - the
truth, say the ladies. But, when she
appears, a highly melodramatic figure,
heavily veiled, the truth she delivers
is Pirandellian.
By introducing three characters who
would seem more at home in a Greek
tragedy into a comedy of provincial
life, Pirandello strikingly produces the
effect of two different kinds of reality.
The effect produced is melodramatic
rather than tragic, because Pirandello
is concerned to make an intellectual
rather than an emotional point. Forty-
five years after it was written it still
seems an avant-garde play, and one
with a great deal of vitality, which is
well brought out by Coralie Campbell’s
lively production.
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Moby Dick Rehearsed. Orson Welles.
Russell St., Melbourne.
AHAB, Melville’s ivory-legged Old
Testament obsessive, is not an easy
part to cast, requiring as it does an
actor of prodigious energy and pre-
sence. Fortunately, in Frank Thring,
the Union Rep. has a leviathan of
such bulk and talent he could play the
Whale.
Accompanied by John Sumner’s
pyrotechnic lighting and sound effects,
he makes the whole theatre pitch and
yaw. All of which is very exciting if
you like that sort of thing. But to me,
both Sumner and Thring used the
wrong means to achieve a debatable end.
The essential idea of Welles’ “Moby
Dick” is surely to demonstrate the
power of the theatrical illusion in its
most simple terms. The play is within
a play at a simulated reading. This
exposes the actors to the audience in
the required Brechtian manner, so
they’ve little mystique to sustain them
in what follows.
The play is best in the scene where
Ahab sits talking to “poor black Pip”
in his cabin. Pip is bemoaning his
blackness, which he equates with sin.
But Ahab, obsessed with his white
whale, begins to describe the fear and
evil he sees in whiteness. For once
there are no sound-effects or disco-
theque lighting; just the magic of
some of the most remarkable words
I’ve heard on a stage, beautifully de-
livered by a quiet, intense Thring.. A
speech that Stokely Carmichael would
have been proud to have written, it’s
a scene that proves Welles’ thesis. That
if all the sets were lost and the lighting
fused, one man alone on a bare stage
can still captivate an audience.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The same old words: get
out and sell
NOT COUNTING a lot of things like
petroleum products and fertilisers
fashioned from both imported and
local materials, Australia’s exports of
manufactured goods rose by 8£ per-
cent to a record level of $506 mil-
lion or about a sixth of the country’s
biggest tally yet, $3015 million, in the
year to June last. On the face of it,
this isn’t a bad effort for chaps who,
according to Mr. A. C. Wigan, ex-
director of GM-H and leader of the
recently returned Australian trade
mission to Britain and Europe, don’t
even bother to open their mail.
But it so happens that manufac-
tured exports, with the uncertain New
Zealand market our biggest cus-
tomer, have not been doing as well
as the rest. Their 8£ percent rise last
year compares with one of nearly 12
percent for exports as a whole. Some
will shrug this off by saying that we
can’t help boosting export receipts for
minerals, say, with so much more com-
ing from our mines and going into
world markets at high prices or being
shipped under long-term (and favor-
ably priced) contracts to Japan and
other countries. The big-ticket minerals
items certainly bumped up last year’s
total; iron ore, for instance, netted
about $4B million, whereas the year
before only $2 million or so.
Being only a sixth of the total, manu-
factured exports may possibly be re-
garded as of marginal influence on
exports as a whole. But they are very
important, nontheless, and Wigan
does a service in stirring the ante about
them. At any rate he is quite in order
in saying exporters or potential export-
ers to the areas the mission visited were
missing opportunities.
In a word, Mr. Wigan says we are
not really trying in earnest to tap these
markets and he tells us how to go about
doing so. His report is a worth-while
document all potential exporters to
these and other markets should study
closely, and in its turn the Department
of Trade should get its whips out to
encourage the follow-up.
The Wigan formula starts with the
need for thorough preliminary market
research into these markets and the
best place, he says, to get busy on this
is in Australia itself. As he says, the
Department of Trade is not a babe in
this wood. It has trade commissioners
all over the place and in growing
numbers. Its files here are full of help-
ful information.
Thorough research here must pre-
cede actual visits by sales representa-
tives and executives. The drill in
preparation for a visit to an area
should be to apprise the trade com-
missioner in the area of the proposed
visit well in advance of arrival and
at the same time to brief the appro-
priate trade commissioner adequately
on what product is in mind and what
expectation about its sales are enter-
tained. Mr. Wigan reckons that a
man or a team would need at least
a week in the market for a start
and that this may not seem all that
much time to devote to a determined
penetration.
His last bit of advice is to partici-
pate in official and industry promotion,
such as exhibiting at trade fairs. He
considers this possibly the most telling
way to introduce and get accepted
products on the European and British
markets. Mr. Wigan warns that the
task of establishing new manufactured
products in these markets is not easy,
nor can it be done quickly.
Britain
Tricky September
SEPTEMBER IS usually reckoned to
be a tricky month for Britain’s economy
and this year is proving no exception.
It seemed that the country was ■ well
on its way out of its balance of pay-
ments bog early this year. Things have
turned out otherwise.
It would seem that Mr. Callaghan
.missed his chance in the Budget to give
the economy more breathing room
and it was widely expected then that
the relaxations now being offered by
Mr. Wilson, as the self-appointed
supremo over economic affairs, may
have come a little late to avert a
substantial rise in unemployment in the
coming northern winter. As for sterl-
ing, the reflationary measures the PM
is effecting, while giving a lift to the
domestic economy, cannot but help to
boost the imports bill.
The question is whether the bears
A. C. Wigan: formula for exports
of sterling will anticipate this and go
into action just at the time of the
year when payments for imports are
at their seasonal heaviest. The situa-
tion for sterling therefore looks very
delicate.
Off-shore oil
State rights again
NOW THAT SHELL Development has
moved its Sedco rig out of the un-
profitable more eastern waters near
Port Phillip over to the environs of the
South Australian border to try its luck
there (third time lucky?), the ques-
tion of whose water is which State’s be-
comes a bit more interesting. As a
matter of fact the hole now being
drilled by Shell 20 miles west of Port-
land is without doubt firmly in Vic-
torian waters, but the rig might wander
if it finds anything interesting. In that
case South Australians say they will
be perfectly satisfied. When the off-
shore boundary dispute flared up last
year, S.A. wanted the existing border
extended out to sea but Victoria argued
that the extension, according to inter-
national law, would have been a median
line survey to the edge of the con-
tinental shelf equidistant from the shore
of each State. S.A. gave in because it
felt an arbitrator would plump exactly
for that, so the present compromise was
reached and both parties are satisfied
with it.
However, the all clear hasn’t yet
been given on the future Federal and
State rights in offshore drilling opera-
tions. Legislation on this is expected
to be handled in the current session in
Canberra.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: The Commonwealth Government’s
restrictive trade practices legislation became law on Friday,
September 1.
Wool prices moved a little higher, but the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics believes prevailing low levels could
continue until late in 1967.
The June quarter saw private capital investment go back
from $431.2m (March quarter) to $398.0m (both figures
seasonably adjusted) the lowest for two years.
For the markets : Mining issues have shown some-
thing of a pickup on Australian share markets, yet remain
well under their August best. Industrials are firming on
good company results. |
A slackening of earlier equity gains took London back
at the close . . . Wall Street produced some smallish rises,
but a few blue chips eased.
For Companies : Economists, and shareholders too, are
beginning to rejoice at the excellence of many of the
1966-67 results now pouring in.
Miners this week can be disposed of quickly, yet it’s
nice to know that Consolidated Gold Fields Australia went
above prospectus forecasts in earning $4,114,705 for the
first full year; dividend, as expected, is at 10 percent.
Emphasising an expansive mood, Melbourne’s Industrial
Engineering hoisted dividend from 11 to 12 percent on
earnings up from $910,067 to $1,011,299 . . . From the

MEN AND MATTERS
IS THE AUSTRALIAN image gradu-
ally fading from Alcan Australia Ltd.?
The retirement of John E. Hatton
from the managing directorship of
Alcan (until this year known as Aus-
tralian Aluminium Co. Ltd., or, more
familiarly, Australuco) means a step-
up for John P. Lee, who will also con-
tinue as general manager, South Pacific
area for the Montreal parent, Alcan
Aluminium Ltd., Hatton came to Aus-
tralia in 1953 from the British
Aluminium Co., of the U.K., which at
that time owned 50 percent of Austra-
luco. When Alcan took over sole
ownership in 1963, he stayed on. He
will continue to serve on the board of
Alcan Australia and of Queensland
Alumina Ltd., and has been recently
elected president of the Aluminium De-
velopment Council.
Mr. Hatton’s business has involved
seven or eight trips abroad from Aus-
tralia, but travel he considers a pleasure
for the opportunity it gives to meet
people. Golf and bowls provide relaxa-
tion, and he doesn’t mind getting his
hands dirty in his garden at Wah-
roonga. When business interests permit,
Hatton hopes to build on land at Cur-
rurribin on the Gold Coast.
His successor, Harvard man John
Lee, is getting to know his sixth country
and fourth continent in his career with
Alcan. Son of a Norwegian, he learned
to sail before he could walk. He enjoys
fishing, although he’s been too busy
so far for any fishing in Australian
waters.
THERE’S MANY A SLIP ... as
Councillor Lance Reichstein, chairman
and managing director of Industrial
Engineering, now knows only too well
after his unsuccessful campaign to suc-
ceed lan Beaurepaire as Lord Mayor
of Melbourne. Everybody, including the
Melbourne “Herald,” thought he was
home and hosed—that is until he de-
clared, virtually on the eve of the elec-
tion, that industrial costs in Victoria
were too high and he was going outside
the State for his company’s expansion.
With Sir Maurice Nathan the chair-
man of the Victoria Promotion Com-
mittee and a former Lord Mayor with
considerable influence with the Civic
Group which nominates the Lord
Mayor, he couldn’t expect to get away
with that and was pipped on the post.
So Cr. Reg Talbot, very much the
dark horse, who is managing director
of his own business equipment firm,
Talbot and McGlashan, and was born
in London 61 years ago, got the job
on what was called a close vote. It is
J. E. Hatton
Cr. Reichstein
a sort of Dick Whittington story r
though the first steps to the Lord
Mayor’s parlor in Talbot’s case were
that he came to the golden mile in
Melbourne from Britain when he was
four, went to Mordialloc State School,
became an errand boy in an office
equipment show, and later, after be-
coming a captain in the AIF, started
his own business. Things should now
start moving faster at the Town Hall.
Talbot was an “even time” sprinter
and captained the Victoria Rugby team
in the ’thirties. In the MCC he’s al-
ready recognised as an expert on public
works and traffic problems, which in
themselves should keep him more than
busy.


The "Free list" Drug Business
THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
BY J. C. HORSFALL
AS WELL AS ITS physiological side
effects, the therapeutic revolution has
had economic and social ones, not least
being the annual outcry against the
activities of the drug companies. This
has come a little early this year with
Federal and N.S.W. Government medi-
cal authorities leading the band.
Usually the critics wait until the Direc-
tor-General of the Commonwealth
Health Department has issued his
annual report before lashing out with
the familiar charges of exploitation, that
the pill pedlars are pushing too hard,
that the cost of free-list drugs to the
Government is exorbitant, and so on.
Before buying into the argument,
one needs to dilute the charge (“Sydney
Morning Herald,” August 23) that the
cost of subsidising drugs under the
Commonwealth Health Scheme is “run-
ning into hundreds of millions of dol-
lars.” Taking the figures from the
recent Government Budget papers, the
cost of drugs under the scheme last
year was $99.3 million, of which 30
percent was expended on drugs for
pensioners and 70 percent for the rest
of the public. The annual cost of drugs
for pensioners has risen from $19.8 mil-
lion to $29.3 million in the past five
years; for the remainder of the public
it has gone up from $57.1 to $72 mil-
lion; that is, in one case by about 50
percent and in the other by about 26
percent. The whole of this burden
doesn’t fall on the Commonwealth.
Patients pay a share rather less than
a fifth. So the true figure for the so-
called “subsidy” last year would have
been slightly more than $BO million
(the precise figure will be in the Direc-
tor-General’s report not yet to hand).
“Subsidy” is hardly the right word
for the Commonwealth Government’s
outlay under the pharmaceutical bene-
fits scheme. It is certainly not a pro-
ducer subsidy, that is, a Government
handout, say, as the butter subsidy is to
dairy farmers. Nor is it strictly a con-
sumer subsidy. Because, although every-
body in the community stands to bene-
fit from it, everybody (or practically
everybody) helps to pay for it through
taxation. Anyway, it is nonsense to
refer to it as a subsidy to drug com-
panies. It is quite beside the point that
about half the Government’s outlay on
drugs under the scheme goes to the
drug companies, rather more than a
third to chemists (they’re always trying
to get more, and an inquiry is on about
this at the moment), and the remainder
to the wholesalers. That split-up is a
highly controversial one in itself, and
has nothing to do with charges that
the drug companies are enjoying a
bonanza from drugs they sell on the
“free list.”
If there is anything at all in the
charge of subsidy it lies in the possi-
bility that the Department of Health
is paying the drug companies more
than an economic price for their wares.
The question, then, is how is the
price fixed. The first point to note here
is that the Minister for Health alone
decides which types of drugs can be
prescribed under the scheme, and in
this role he takes the advice of an
expert committee of the Department’s
own choosing. Though the drug com-
panies are in keen competition to get
their products accepted, they are not
represented on the committee. Then
the Department sits down with the
manufacturer and fixes the price. My
impression, after talking with some of
the manufacturers, is that it is arrived
at after hard and impatient negotia-
tion, “sensible, straight talking” as one
of them put it, with concern on the
Department’s side that the total bill for
drugs is going up and with the manu-
facturers begging realistic recognition
of the enormous cost of the research
work being undertaken by their com-
panies.
Manufacturers say that the Depart-
ment of Health strikes some very hard
bargains in these frequent negotiations.
It knows how to pull the shots, and
in the past it has not shown itself as
dissatisfied with the results of its price
negotiations with the manufacturers as
last week’s Government spokesman
tried to make out. For instance, the
last Director-General’s report took a
deal of credit for its efforts in 1965-66.
It said: “Negotiations with manufac-
turers resulted in reduction in price
during 1965-66 which would save the
pharmaceutical benefits scheme approxi-
mately $4.8 million in a full year if the
rate prescribing with these drugs were
to remain constant. Price reductions in
respect of frequently used drugs such as
antibiotics and analgesics has the
greatest effect on the reductions, which
were effected in most therapeutic groups
of drugs.”
One manufacturer told me that the
price of his firm’s main product had
been reduced by 30 percent in the last
year or so not at his behest, of
course, but at that of the Department
of Health. As a guide line to prices, the
U.K. price is usually taken and adjust-
ments made, say, for the lower volume
market here compared with Britain
and our higher transportation and
wholesalers’ costs. The Department chal-
lenges the companies hard to justify
any difference between the. price they
think fair and the U.K. price. On the
other hand, the manufacturers say that
many of their drugs are priced well
below the U.K. price for the same
drug, although they admit that the
much higher chemists’ mark-up in the
U.K. (where there is no prescription
fee under the National Health Scheme)
has something to do with this.
In the upshot, although the cost
of the total pharmaceutical benefits
scheme bill is going up, the average
cost of prescriptions in 1965-66 (the
last year for which figures are yet
available) was $1.89 compared with
$2.01 five years earlier. Over that five
years the number of prescriptions per
head of population rose from 3.56 to
4.36 a year, with the most of the in-
crease attributable to pensioners (they
and children are the biggest drug con-
sumers under the scheme). The number
of prescriptions per pensioner rose from
14.8 in 1962 to 16.38 in 1965-66, while
the number per head for the rest of
the population increased only from 2.65
to 3.32 over the same period. So the
two main factors behind the rising cost
of the scheme are the growth in popu-
lation and the rise in the need for drugs
by pensioners. Clearly the cost per
prescription has had little to do with
it. As a matter of fact, with prices and
costs rising in the whole economy over
this period, it is surprising to me that
the cost of supplying drugs to the
scheme has not followed suit.
Part of the explanation of why it
hasn’t is obviously the pressure put on
manufacturers by the Department of
Health to give the scheme some of the
benefits of higher volume production.
Part would lie in the intense compe-
tition within the industry itself. Also,
the Department lays great stress in its
messages to doctors to prescribe the
less expensive drugs when these would
be just as appropriate to cases as the
“high artillery” and more costly drugs.
Doctors, themselves, are often “pres-
surised” by patients in the opposite
direction, that is, to prescribe the more
costly and latest drugs. All this would
seem to dilute the charge that the
manufacturers are overstaffed with de-
tailers pestering doctors to use their
firm’s products. On the other hand,
though the manufacturers strongly re-

fute it, there is certainly something in
this charge.
I couldn’t get anybody in the in-
dustry to tell me what its travelling
salesmen cost or even what percentage
of the sales dollar they take. It must
be considerable. Is it necessary? From
the national viewpoint it must be uneco-
nomic, but, looked at by the individual
firm in the industry, essential. The big
drug-makers put up a united front in
the Australian Pharmaceutical Manu-
facturers’ Association, but, over a jar,
people in the business will tell you that
they’re at one another’s throats, that
the competition is intense, and. the go-
ing tough.. The profusion of detailers,
pill pedlars if you like, is the tan-
gible costly outworking of this state of
affairs. Any firm which, didn’t match
its rivals in the. pill-peddling game
would fall flat on its face. •
The main play in this sphere is
among the 15 big, so-called research-
based companies which are all
foreign, mainly U.S. and Swiss owned,
and which supply the bulk of drugs on
the free list. The degree of competition
between them to get their products pre-
scribed by the medical profession, in-
cluding the hospitals, is practically in-
ternecine. They stand apart from the
main stream of medical preparations
sold in the chemist shops the pro-
prietary medicines, and so on.
Although they are selling an increas-
ing volume of veterinary and agricultu-
ral lines outside the pharmaceutical
benefits scheme, and this is going to be
an increasing part of their business,
their current prosperity rests largely
on drugs sold under the scheme.
The field looks overcrowded. The
market is highly fragmented, with
several firms supplying the same sorts
of product (of course, not necessarily
identical products, but products with
different trade names which do the
same type of job within, say, the ranges
of antibiotics, antihypertensives, diure-
tics, sedatives, vitamins, tranquillisers,
and so forth). Market shares of the
leading companies have jumped up and
down in reflection of the fierce and
growing competition in recent years.
Merck, after being in third place five
years ago, is now, with about 8.6 per-
cent of the market, leading supplier,
having almost double the market share
of its nearest rival, Parke Davis, which
has held steadily in second place for
years. SKF has come up from fifth to
third, and Squibb (whose new factory
in Melbourne started up earlier this
year) from eighth to fourth, both with
about four percent now. Lilley has come
up from tenth to fifth, and now has
about 3| percent. Against these flights,
Lederle has dropped from first to eighth
and Schering from fourth to tenth.
Abbott has kept sixth place in the past
five years; Burroughs Wellcome has
dropped a couple of places to seventh,
and Ciba has moved up a couple of
places.
The industry claims only about eight
percent of its. sales prices represents the
cost of research. Yet, and this must be
emphasised, only a minute part of this -
research expenditure is incurred in
Australia. The price here is, therefore,
loaded with overseas expenditure. Un-
doubtedly this is right and proper, be-
cause without the huge outlay on
research by the parent companies they
wouldn’t have discovered the products.
To discover new products their reseaich
expenditure has had to be stepped up
from year to year. I’m told the U.S.
parent companies, Merck and Squibb,
two of the biggest, with factories in
Australia, last year spent upwards of
$lOO million between them on research
into new drugs, against odds of some-
thing like 4000 to one of finding one.
Last year the industry in the U.S. put
$317 million into research (against our
$1 million or so) and came up with
23 new products. This compares with
$l7O million put in in 1959 and the
discovery of 67 new products. So while
the expenditure goes up sharply, the
number of discoveries goes the other
way. New drugs are proving much
harder and more expensive to get
(drugs discovered overseas are not auto-
matically accepted here; to get on the
pharmaceutical benefits free list Aus-
tralian work on drugs has to be shown
together with voluminous information
on the work and tests done on them
overseas).
For companies spending these huge
amounts on research, it is understand-
able that if they come up with a new
product they will want to protect their
rights over it by patenting it and
giving it a trade name. Not all drug
manufacturers or discoverers are as
altruistic, say, as Eli Lilly, who found
insulin and declared that nobody Was
ever to make a profit out of the sub-
stance. How much present-day drug
manufacturers of prescription drugs add
on to the prices to cover their pro-
prietary rights over them is anybody’s
guess, but something seems justified.
Competition would limit the scope for
this. Recent critics of the high cost
of drugs here seem to think the manu-
facturers should add nothing and sell
their drugs to the hospitals in bulk
irrespective of trade names. If the
authorities ever insist on this they can
reckon on a headlong clash with the
industry.
The drug companies often come
under strong criticism for their expen-
sive advertising. Is it in fact too high?
Is so much advertising necessary? On
these questions the paramount factor
for the companies is again the strongly
competitive nature of the industry.
Against that, individual companies have
to recognise, as some do rather less-
than others, that doctors, to whom most
of their advertising is directed, are in-
telligent people (though usually in a
hurry), unlikely to be taken in by
phony or lavish advertising. As some-
body replied to a critic who’d told
him half his advertising was unneces-
sary: “Tell me which half and I will
stop it tomorrow.” I guess the drug
companies would do just that to cut
out any waste in advertising expendi-
ture. Doubtless they would do the
same with their often criticised num-
bers* of detailers used to appraise the
medical profession of their drugs (side
effects as well as virtues);
One of the main hopes for future
drug prices is that, in due course, say
by rationalisation in the industry itself,
even under governmental inspiration,
they will not prove as intractable as the
industry now claims they are. Another
force could be the increasing economies
being achieved by the industry as it
expands on the most modern lirtcs
to meet the growing local and export
demands for drugs. On present indica-
tions exports may contribute at least
as much to this as local demand.
The industry’s export achievements
have, already been remarkable and the
potential would seem to be enormous,
in this direction.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Mining interests,
and others, in
Western Australia
UNTIL LAST WEEK the Govern-
ment had laid down the law on export
prices for iron ore. It was not allowed
to be sold for less than U.S. 18 cents
a unit. This was done so that the
locals couldn’t enter into a price war
with each other and sell out too
cheaply to the Japanese. The rule has
now been changed. Recent develop-
ment of new deposits in South America
and West Africa has convinced the
Government that our boys should be
given an open go. As a result, the price
restrictions have been taken off. Loud
cheers were heard from the Hamers-
ley camp on the announcement of the
news. Only 18 months before, the
company lost a juicy $lOO million con-
tract because of a price squabble, caused
by the Government’s policy. Funnily
enough, some of the other producers do
not seem quite so cheerful about the
news. Worries about having to compete
with each other and the king-sized Harm-
ersley are obviously weighing heavily
on their minds. It will be interesting
to see what effects the new policy will
have. The main public companies in-
volved are Hamersley, BHP, CSR,
McDonald Industries, Goldfields, Wes-
tern Mining, and Mount Morgan.
While on the subject of miners, a
stock which currently appeals is Wes-
tralian Oil. Despite its name, the com-
pany nowadays has little to do with
oil but is firmly entrenched in the beach
sand industry. It specialises in mining
ilmenite in a little place called Yog-
anup in the south-west corner of
Western Australia. In 1966/67 it pro-
duced 75,558 tons of ilmenite and
13,583 tons of zircon. Next year it
reckons these figures will be up to
130,000 tons and 20,000 tons respec-
tively. If these targets are reached the
current price of $1.17 looks a snatch.
In addition, the company also has the
extra appeal of being constantly men-
tioned as a takeover prospect for Con-
solidated Goldfields. Fuel is added to
this rumor fire by the fact that the
ANZ Nominees hold a goodly bunch of
the company’s shares in trust for some-
one who could quite feasibly be Gold-
fields.
Another company that has an in-
terest in Western Australia is Concrete
Industries Monier. The fate of its share
price hangs to some degree on the out-
come of its $6 million claim for losses
in the area. The claim is against the
U.S. Navy for work done on the North
West Cape radio base in Western Aus-
tralia. Already the company has been
successful in four of its claims; now
the last and largest has been heard.
This claim relates to the construction
of a pier and a decision is expected
shortly. General opinion, based on the
previous successful decisions and the
political implications involved, is that
the verdict will be favorable to the local
company. If this is the case, then
directors have indicated that a return of
capital to shareholders will follow. On
this basis, 47 cents a share seems to be
a more than reasonable buying price.
If the claim is not successful the full
$6 million loss (some of which has been
already settled) has been fully written
off and the company still looks a fair in-
vestment. Though profit for the half-
year to December at $909,617, was
down a bit on the previous December
period, it highlights the fact that the
company is well along the road to a
sound and sustained recovery. Good
profits for the building industry in the
current year and rumors of a revolu-
tionary new product for the company
both give added investment appeal.
A company that has lost its appeal
is Ansett. Having been encouraged by
the five percent rise in domestic air
passenger and freight rates of a few
weeks ago, I thought the stock had
short-term prospects at 67 cents. Un-
fortunately, smack-bang on t'he heels
of the rise came the Government’s
announcement of a 10 percent rise
in air navigation charges and its
plans for having a passenger service
charge. If that' doesn’t put a damper
on air travel and airline companies
nothing will. It certainly cooled my
enthusiasm, which wasn’t all that hot
anyway, and I sold out at 71 cents. If
Greyhound Buses were listed I -would
not hesitate in placing the proceeds
there, where at least a little growth
can be expected.

Can industrials catch up on
the mining stocks?

MELBOURNE BROKERS McKinley
Wilson & Co. have always been keen
on the theory that, over the long term
(and not so long), the trend in ordinary
share prices shows a fairly close cor-
relation with that in gross national
product and they now bring it to atten-
tion again, perhaps because they feel
time is running out on them. For, as
they point out, GNP on an uncorrected
basis has risen by more than 60 percent,
whereas the average rise in ordinary
share prices in the Melbourne market
(all ordinaries index groups one to 16)
has been only 35 percent. Indeed.
As a matter of fact, if you take
groups 12 and 15 out of the calcula-
tion you find that the rest are at about
the same level as they were in 1960.
What they see happening, at long last
though, is that the rise in the mining
market is rubbing off on industrials.
One would hope so, but the prices of
a large number of industrials are still
at their lowest for four years. It is
time they caught up.
Against this is the big voice from the
leader of the Capel Court stable, which
is shortly to move its brooms into
the new Legal & General Building
now almost finished at the corner of
Queen and Collins Streets. In a word,
Mr. Ricketson tells us he doesn’t
think interest rates are going to fall.
This must put a brake on equities.
Yes, but is this merely wishful think-
ing? At least Mr. R. S. Clayton, chair-
man of CMF Managers Ltd., doesn’t
think so. Nor, on the general point of
the upsurge in mining development in-
fecting industrial development with the
same urgencies, does Mr. C. G. Mc-
Grath, the chairman of Repco, as he
pointed out at this year’s AIDA annual
meeting. Up to now, said Mr. Clayton,
the industrial leaders had got the mes-
sage very well and their yields are now
around 3.5 percent or less. His view is
that it may be assumed that the rest
will catch on pretty soon. These, as he
said, give a much higher income and
will come more into favor as time goes
on.
But looking for palatable company
food for its thoughts, the market had
good fare this week with any number of
excellent results which, over a wide
range of industries, reflected the
general rise in economic activity in the
last half of the year to June 30. One
can’t mention them all, but reports
directly attributing the better perfor-
mances to a rise in profitability of
trading in the second half of the year
included such a diverse collection as
Bradford Cotton, Dural Leeds, lAC,
Dunlop, Metropolitan Dairies, Preston
Motors (no profit figures yet), Hilton
Corporation, APM, Courtaulds,' and
Boral. Looking at the field generally,
one can’t help feeling that cost in-
flation has not been as übiquitous as
might have been thought with such
steep wage increases during the year
and it now becomes a very interesting
conjecture whether this is now going
to get more rampant. If it does we
shall soon hear about it and it could
become more a market factor than
it has been thus far.
IT IS A PLEASANT change to have
a' board of directors saying their firm
is getting plenty of Government orders
and, for shareholders, an even more
pleasant one when they announce such
a good result, of which the market took
some notice, as Electronic Industries
did last week. However, even if direc-
tors have been as good as the inten-
tions expressed in the report last year
and put new vigor into operations, a
78 percent increase in pre-tax profits
has yielded an increase in earnings on
the “A” and “B” ordinaries of only
from 10.1 to 13.1 percent to cover,
rather better than in recent years, the
dividend now maintained at seven per-
cent. The market put the “B” shares
up to 97 cents last week, which is
about double the level at one time this
year, on the star-studded preliminary
report; they could go better, especially
if the full report elaborates favorably
on such aspects as the group’s improv-
ing liquidity.
ONCE A POPULAR little share in
the Melbourne market, RVB Engineer-
ing Products, which takes its name from
the initials of its chairman and man-
aging director and produces a wide
range of automotive accessories at.
Spotswood, still has its admirers be-
cause of its unimpeachable dividend-
paying record a record sustained
even this year when, in face of its
fourth successive profit drop, which
reduced earnings to 20.5 percent, the
shareholders got their fourth 20 per-
cent payout in a row. In the course
of these four years earnings have
been halved, so what with the motor
vehicles industry not being down for
much of the period this probably must
be reckoned a declining company and
The Chartist says:
CARRIER AIR CONDITIONING LTD. could be a stock to watch during the
next few weeks as it is a classic example of a long base on the point of breaking
the major downtrend with exciting technical implications. A high point of $2.70
was achieved in 1960, followed by a decline which eventually took prices to a low
of 42c in 1963. A “bullish” signal was given toward the end of 1965 when prices
rose to 80c, but the decline again continued to 50c. The movement over the past
few weeks has taken prices to the major downtrend line and, if prices rise above
80c on heavy volume, this stock would be a safe buy. Short-term targets of
approximately $l.lO and $1.50 could be achieved fairly quickly and a longer-term
objective of about $2.50 is also a possibility. At tins level it would encounter
strong resistance selling from the 1960 area of trading. Last sale price on 29/8/67 —
75c.

the 8.7 percent now yielded by the
shares should be looked at most cir-
cumspectly. It would be nice if the
company picked up in line with the
motor industry in the current year.,
But we wouldn’t count on it, nor cjp
shareholders getting a 20 percent divi-
dend this year.
A COMPANY which has not called
on shareholders for 15 years, and which
returned half its capital five years ago,
York Motors, is now turning to share-
holders for capital. Its issue is to pro-
vide extra working funds for the busi-
ness of distributing BMC vehicles in
Sydney and Brisbane, Rolls-Royce and
Bentley cars in N.S.W. and Queens-
land Toyota vehicles in N.S.W., and
Perkins engines in Brisbane.
Last year’s earning rate of 47 per-
cent should not be trimmed back so
far as to endanger the 25 percent divi-
dend which directors expect to main-
tain, for the issue is one-for-three at a
premium of 20 percent of the 25 c
shares. The half-year’s results to May
31 show higher turnover and profit. On
the present market value of $1.15, the
shares should average down to 97c
and a not very tempting yield of 6.4
percent after the issue.
FEELING RATHER unloved on a
long yield of 7.4 percent (at 68c)
Bradford Cotton Mills endeavored to
woo Pressmen at the company’s first-
ever conference. A particularly healthy
result, profit up 16 percent, sales a
record, earning rate 17.2 percent
against the traditional 10 percent divi-
dend, prompted the board to try to
show the company off to better advan-
tage.
Sir Robert Webster, chairman, said
frequent disruptive tariff inquiries into
the textile game (spinning and weav-
ing, not knitting), often initiated by
outsiders, gave the impression Austra-
lian cotton textilers were inefficient.
While admitting that the American
textilers lose everyone in efficiency and
workloads, Australian workloads are as
good as, if not better than, the Japan-
ese and the French, and Australian
machinery and equipment are quite as
good as elsewhere. One-time manager
of the Queensland Cotton Board, Sir
Robert said there was a big advantage
to the company in having local cotton
supplies, on which Bradford drew for
70 percent of its 1966-67 requirements.
This current year, except for the finest
staple cotton, Australian growers could
supply all of Bradford’s needs.
After a prolonged period of plant
re-equipment, Bradford is now giving
more attention to marketing, and The
Bulletin hazards the opinion that the
company is moving into higher gear.
For an income stock, the investor can-
not sneeze at Bradford’s current low-
risk return.

Security analysis
ICIANZ: growth chances for
a chemical giant
THAT IMPERIAL CHEMICAL
Industries of Australia and New
Zealand Limited is the chemical giant of
Australia, there is no doubt. It is doubt-
ful whether the ordinary shares of a
chemical giant are a good investment
today, although only four years ago the
financial writers were ecstatic about the
“growth prospects.”
It would take more space than one
thousand words just to list the various
products which the company and its
various subsidiaries make. I would
also estimate that‘several million words
have been written about the company
in the Sydney Press alone over the past
year or so. In fact, 1965 seems to have
been the year when ICIANZ was hardly
ever out of the financial news. In that
year the company made its last issue
to shareholders. This issue was on a
one-for-six basis and at a premium of
fifty percent over the par value of the
shares, which was $2 at the time. So far
as I can judge the share price reached
its peak in the preceding year, but it
was still fairly high in 1965. The mid-
point between the high and low prices
for 1965, after adjustment for the new
issue, was $2.40, or nearly 12 percent
above the price at the time of writing
and 40 percent above the 1967 low
point.
Although the trend in the market
price has been steadily downward since
1964, the opinion of writers and coun-
sellors has been rather more varied.
The most detailed analysis which I have
on file, and which was prepared in that
year, concluded that, although the
shares were highly priced in terms of
earnings, there was little likelihood of
any fall in the price and there was scope
for moderate capital gains. The equiva-
lent price at the time was $2.50! By
1965, some doubts seem to have arisen,
for there were a few who were recom-
mending that ICIANZ’s ordinary shares
were overpriced. One at least had a
change of mind a year later and recom-
mended purchase at $2.00, approxi-
mately. Six months later (after the
interim profit announcement) the
recommendation changed to “sell” at
the same price of $2 and reverted to
“buy” at $1.86 about twelve months
later.
It is fairly clear that the unadjusted
earnings figures show a variable per-
centage of ordinary capital and of
shareholders’ funds; during 1965 there
were good grounds on the basis of these
figures to assume that the upward trend
of the preceding three years would con-
tinue into 1965. The adjusted figures,
however, disclose that at best the figure
for earnings per share were static and
at worst a declining trend was already
in evidence from 1962. It would seem
that the market had made its calcula-
tions on the basis of adjusted earnings
per share in contra-distinction to some
investment advisers.
The interim report for the 1966-7
year, issued in June last, was heralded
with some enthusiasm because group
profit rose by over 10| percent. The
commentators made no reference to the
increase of six percent in average ordin-
ary capital. If no adjustment is made
for the low tax provision (due to in-
vestment allowances), per share earnings
seem to have risen by about nine per-
cent but, if an adjustment is made,
the increase seems to be very much
smaller. Still, even if we use the un-

adjusted figure and ignore the fact that
tax provided was only 36 percent of
pre-tax profit, the shares are still selling
at about 21 times earnings when the
price is $2.15. To me this means that
the investor at this price is expecting an
annual rate of growth in earnings per
share of at least nine percent com-
pound for the next ten years. If account
is taken of the tax savings on invest-
ment allowances, the growth rate will
need to be about 13 percent.
Where will this growth come from?
The last annual report indicated that a
large proportion of ICIANZ’s sales
were directed toward the agricultural
industry (30 percent) and about ten
percent to the textile and clothing in-
dustries. Paint and the automotive in-
dustry also ranked fairly high at about
nine percent. Of course, these figures do
not mean that these groups are also the
profit providers in the same propor-
tions, but the figures may well indicate
the areas in which ICIANZ has made
its major investments.
There is some evidence that the fer-
tiliser industry will take a few years be-
fore demand catches up with the
present installed capacity. It also seems
that ICIANZ’s involvement in this area
is the result of second thoughts, be-
cause in 1958 the company sold its
holding in Australian Fertilisers, which
it had held for many years. It could
well be that the growth in nitrogenous
fertilisers will be at the expense of
superphosphate, thus ensuring that the
substantial capacity that has been in-
stalled will be taken up quite rapidly,
but any loss of sales in superphosphate
will affect ICIANZ, which has also
been spending substantial sums in
this area.
Another problem in the fertiliser
field is likely to be the price structure.
The rural community is quite impor-
tant and has been facing falling prices
for its products and rising costs for
some little time now. Increased con-
sumption will only occur if the price
remains fairly stable so far as all forms
of fertiliser are concerned. Similarly,
pressures to reduce any tariffs could
well occur as the farmer continues
to struggle with other rising costs.
The other main area of supplies to
agriculture is probably chemicals
weedicides, pesticides, etc. In recent
years, there has been very strong com-
petition from many other overseas
manufacturers and, while there are un-
doubted prospects for greater use of
many agricultural chemicals, price will
again be the dominant factor.
The textile sales probably relate in
the main to Fibremakers, although
other divisions of the ICIANZ group
would also serve the textile and cloth-
ing industries. Fibremakers has been
engaged in an expansion program de-
signed to lift its capacity by fifty per-
cent and enable it to supply the whole
of Australia’s current requirements of
nylon. Its one competitor is Allied
Chemical, which has a much smaller
capacity and which has not apparently
entered the field of fine-denier nylon
yarn. The situation at the moment
therefore looks quite comfortable.
The pressure on ICIANZ’s margins
overall only seems to have occurred
since 1963-4 onward. With the excep-
tion of the 1960-61 year, trading profit
(before tax, depreciation, interest, and
other provisions and expenses) as a
percentage of total sales increased from
1958-9 to 1962-3 but has declined ever
since. It is just conceivable that this
decline may have resulted from the
consolidation of the figures of Aus-
tralian Fertilisers.
In the current financial year, it seems
that the margin may well have been
maintained in the first half but there is
no sign that it has been restored to the
1962-3 level. It will be interesting to
see what effect the new tariff arrange-
ments have on this margin in the second
half of 1966-7.
If the present pricing of ICIANZ’s
shares is justified at all, it cannot be
in relation to past performance. The
vast expansion program of the past few
years must now be nearing the profit-
earning stage and it could be that the
results of 1966-7 and 1967-8 will be the
pointers for determining the likely
growth rate for the following five
years.

Mining
A second look at Great Boulder
IT HAD TO HAPPEN sooner or later
that one of . the market’s aspiring
bonanzas was pulled up rather sharply.
No doubt a lot of speculators are lick-
ing the wounds they suffered from Great
Boulder’s fall, in little more than a
week, from $3.80 to $1.90. The reason
for the fall is readily seen as disappoint-
ment that the company’s drill holes
failed to live up to hopes that another
“Kambalda” type of deposit was pre-
sent on the company’s prospecting area.
Earlier reports from the company were
that grades of between 0.24 percent
and 0.54 percent nickel were present
in surface outcrops and channel samples
in the old Mt. Martin goldmine. But
the results of diamond drilling failed
to improve on these grades, turning in
grades of between 0.3 percent and 0.5
percent nickel, as well as some gold.
Certainly the results to date have
been nowhere near as rich as the grades
encountered by Western Mining Cor-
poration at Kambalda and its other
deposits. Some of the drill intersec-
tions here contained as high as 12.87
percent nickel. Indeed, very few of Wes-
tern Mining’s intersections contained less
than 1 percent nickel. But there were
several which did contain lower values
than this figure; hole number 13 gave
assays of only 0.79 percent nickel, hole
KD4 contained several intersections, one
of which assayed 0.84 percent nickel,
and KD 7006 had an intersection of 0.7
percent nickel. Apart from these low-
value intersections, there were at least
eight holes which did not encounter
mineralisation or in which the assays
were “not significant.” (This was the
appellation used by Western Mining.)
The success of any mining venture
depends on costs and prices as well as
grade. Initial estimates for the price
that Western Mining would be likely
to receive for its nickel have turned
out to be pessimistic. The outlook for
supplies of this metal caused the Sumi-
tomo group of Japan to sign a long-
term contract with WMC for nickel at
about $1750 per ton, whereas earlier
indications were that the company
would receive around $llOO per ton.
Perhaps it is too optimistic to suggest
that a similar price would be obtained
by any other Australian producer, but
at such a price the drilling results of
Great Boulder certainly deserve a
second 100k —perhaps they are not so
bad after all.
On an assumed figure for ore reserves
of one million tons assaying 0.4 percent,
total contained metal would be 4000
tons of nickel. At $1750 per ton this
would be worth s7m. Costs per ton of
ore treated could be around the $lO
mark, giving total costs of, say, slom.,
to leave a loss of s3m. if the gold con-
tent of the ore is ignored. But it would
be dangerous to ignore this factor, as
. 6.4dwt. per ton, which is the grade
encountered by Great Boulder over six-
teen feet at the Mount Martin mine, is
worth $lO per ton of ore mined. There
would need to be only some 300,000
tons of such ore for the operation to
reach break-even point. At the costs
and prices above, the mine would break
even with a recovered grade of 0.6 per-
cent nickel without making any allow-
ance for the gold content of the ore.
It is, of course, far too early to use
this estimate as anything other than
an illustration, particularly in regard
to price and costs. A lot more drills
will have to be sunk before any indica-
tion of tonnage can be made, and, of
course, actual mining grades would be
lower. On results to date, Great Boulder
has perhaps gained interest rather than
lost it. Out of four completed holes,
two gave positive results of ore worth
between $7 and $l5 per ton. This may
be far short of the $63 per ton for
Western Mining’s ore, but it is not so
far short of an economic mining pro-
position as to warrant throwing the
scrip on to the bonfire, even though
at this stage one’s fingers may be feel-
ing fairly warm.
“THERE IS NO question that the new
discovery is an important one . .
In such terms have the directors of
Peko-Wallsend Investments Limited
described the results of a single inter-
section in a drill hole sunk only two
hundred feet west of the main orebody
at the company’s new Juno mine, which
is scheduled to commence production
next month.
The richness of the ore in the Juno
mine was remarked upon in these
columns two months ago. The mine
was estimated to contain some 70,000
tons of ore as long ago as August, 1965,
and there has been no change in this
estimate until last week. Consequently
the development of this mine was re-
garded as a useful but nevertheless
small addition to Peko’s existing opera-
tions at Tennant Creek, while the major
prospect facing the company was the
development of the large Warrego mine.
The results of the first ore samples
from the Juno mine, reported late in
July, contained an unexpectedly com-
mercial quantity of bismuth. It was
pointed out (The Bulletin, July 22)
that the silver, bismuth, and selenium
content of the ore could be worth more
than the gold and copper content for
which the mine was developed.
While the three mines already pro-
ducing at Tennant Creek operate in ore
worth from $22 to $2B per ton for its
gold and copper content, the new mine
is rich in gold—the ore is worth about
$75 per ton for its gold alone. But
the copper, silver, and particularly bis-

muth content add an additional $BO
or more to the value per ton of ore
from the Juno mine. These figures do
not take any account of realisation costs
such as transport, smelting, or refining
but are nevertheless adequate to show
the relative values of the Juno orebody
compared with the orebodies which
have to date provided the bulk of Peko’s
profit. The difference is about $l3O per
ton of ore mined and Peko’s profit will
be getting the benefit of this as from
October.
On planned throughput of 20,000 tons
per year the addition of the Juno mine
to Peko’s existing mining complex could
be responsible for an increment in pre-
tax profit of a nominal $2.6m. This
rather staggering increase compares
with last year’s excellent result of
$2,575,591 before tax and $1,855,720
after tax. During the current year, the
Juno mine will have been in production
for only eight or nine months and will
no doubt build up to the planned pro-
duction rate over a running-in period.
Allowing for this, profits from Juno
for the year ending June, 1968, should
still be in the vicinity of sl£m. or more.
These figures may appear at first sight
to be overly optimistic, especially as
realisation costs in respect of the bis-
muth are difficult to ascertain, but the
profits from the Juno mine will certainly
be very high in proportion to Peko’s
existing earnings.
The results of the discovery of the
new orebody indicate that it may be
almost as rich as the main orebody,
although further drill holes will be
necessary before an accurate assessment
can be made. The drill holes on the
original orebody had a strong tendency
to deflect and it was only with some
difficulty that the company was able to
delineate the reserves in the target area.
From the recent announcement it seems
likely that the deposit could turn out
to be considerably larger than previ-
ously known. As the existing orebody
contains minerals worth about slom.
(half of which is accounted for by
gold), any sizable increases in reserves
would be an event of considerable signi-
ficance, particularly as the mine should
be a relatively low-cost operation.
Commodities
No downturn for
copper prices
RESOLUTION OF disturbances now
afficting copper won’t have any down-
ward influence on prices for quite some
time, most overseas commentators be-
lieve. The major trouble, the strike
throughout the American copper in-
dustry, can scarcely be expected to end
before mid-September; both Kennecott
and Anaconda have suspended their dis-

cussions with the unions indefinitely,
for what that means.
Meanwhile, in Zambia the Govern-
ment is talking about exerting more
control over the Anglo-American Cor-
poration and Roan Selection Trust, par-
ticularly in the direction of working
lower grade ores. Indeed, there are
governmental suggestions of demanding
that the producer price be reintroduced
at levels about £stg.36o a ton (LME
spot prices are now around £stg.3Bo).
Zambia’s catalogue of troubles doesn’t
necessarily stop at that: there may yet
be some hold-up to coal deliveries from
Rhodesia.
Supply losses from the U.S. strikes
have already reached more than
200,000 tons, at a time when post-
holiday demand in Europe could soon
begin to rise. On normal seasonal pat-
terns, prices must inevitably go higher.
Last week Australia saw another
attack by the Non-Ferrous Metal Mer-
chants’ Association on the Federal
Government’s ban on scrap exports.
The association is urging a review of
the situation, with one eye, according
to manufacturers, on a lucrative
Japanese market. Manufacturers also
claim there is a scrap shortage.
SILVER APPEARS rather less excit-
ing than a month ago, when it hit
a top 161 d stg. an ounce; spot prices
are now around 146 d. and forward
around 150 d.
London Metal Exchange quotations
have presumably been influenced by
recent happenings in U.S.A. There the
Treasury has been taking silver coin-
age from circulation. Some sources be-
lieve the Treasury intends to ask for
authority to sell these coins or melt
them down, with the ultimate aim of
putting about 750 m. ounces on the
bullion market.
That amount would give some year’s
cover to the prevailing annual gap be-
tween non-Communist world production
and consumption. About 2000 m. ounces
of silver is on issue in American sub-
sidiary coins.
Prevailing prices may yet attract
some hoarders to disgorge their stocks.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
BHP’s retreat took a lot of attention during most of the
week, especially when the shares went down to $11.30 on
Wednesday as the market tried to cope with a delay in Hali-
but drilling; Friday produced a 40 cent leap, so the price
finished a net 10 cents up at $11.95. Mining stocks got rid
of a fair amount of earlier nervousness; among the advances
were: Western Mining $20.20 (up 30 cents), E. Z. Industries
$3.12 (15 cents), Hamersley $6.94 (14 cents), Peko $4.24
(26 cents). CRA, CGA, and New Broken Hill are still lagging.
Penfolds lost 10 cents after the bonus announcement.

When visitors to Expo 67 sit in the famous “talking” chairs in the Australian
pavilion, they learn about many facets of the Australian way of life. What
they do not always know, however, is that Olympic foam cushioning con-
tributes to the unparalleled comfort of this novel all-Australian furniture.
Polyurethane foam is but one of the many Olympic products, which,
although not seen, are serving many of the nation’s requirements.
You do not see the miles of Olympic cables behind your telephone or the
Olympic thermal insulating materials that help to preserve your food supply,
or the quality that is built into Olympic tyres but they’re there all the
same, working for your comfort and convenience.
If it’s branded “Olympic” it’s the best.
All-Australian and proud of it!

THE LAND
Russia and the wheat agreement
By the RURAL EDITOR
RUSSIA HAS NOT yet indicated
whether it will sign the new Inter-
national Wheat Agreement agreed on
during the Kennedy Round and which
has now been consolidated in a formal
arrangement to supersede the present
one when its expiry date comes round
next July. The new agreement has to
be signed by all intending parties to it
by the end of November, but, according
to the “Economist,” two big issues
have to be resolved before then. One is
whether Russia will sign, and the other,
heavily dependent on whether she does
so, is what percentages of their imports
will importing countries be bound to
buy from the exporting members of the
agreement’s signatories?
The all-important “Annex A” of the
existing agreement specifies these per-
centages. For instance, Egypt is bound
to buy 30 percent of its imports from
IWA signatories, Britain 90 percent (a
more usual figure). The significance of
Russia’s accession to the new agree-
ment is that most people expect the
Russian crop this year to be big enough
to make Russia again, as it always used
to be, a net exporter of grain. If Russia
did become a large exporter over the
next few years, it would be very hard to
tie down importing countries to take
the major part of their imports from
agreement signatories unless Russia was
included.
And if, as seems likely ahead of the
current harvest, the world goes back
into wheat surplus, driving prices below
the new minimum reference price of
$1.73 a bushel for “Hard Winters” at
the Gulf, this could make the new
agreement a pretty meaningless docu-
ment. The Russians are clearly piqued
at what they regard as a fait accompli
in their absence at Geneva, and now
(because they deliberately stayed away)
at Rome. But if they are indeed running
into wheat surpluses again, it is hardly
in their interests to carry their annoy-
ance to the point of not signing the new
agreement at all unless they really
mean to play the maverick.
THE OPENING PLAY for the Royal
Agricultural Society’s annual show in
Melbourne got off to a pleasantly wet
start with the usual wine-testing last
week. But officials were more con-
cerned with the effects the big “dry”
in the State is having on the entries
in the various stock classes. Sheep is
the most seriously hit, with entries
down by 223 on last year. In fact, this
show will be the first one for which
no entries have been received for
Lincoln and Shropshire breeds of
sheep.
The drop x in cattle entries is not so
steep as that in sheep 26 in beef
cattle and similar ones in Angus and
fat cattle, for instance. This is com-
pensated by a big gesture by the much-
maligned dairy industry, which is put-
ting 118 more cows on show than last
year, including a record increase in
the number of Guernseys. Dairy entries,
said Mr. Colin Woodfull, the Show’s
director for the past 15 years, were not
much affected by the dry, because
farmers always hand-fed such stock.
In past years a high proportion of
the sheep and cattle entries has come
from the Western District and the
Wimmera, now the worst affected by
the poor rainfall in the State over the
past year. Farmers in these areas are
now spending up to a dozen hours a
day hand-feeding stock and have little
time on their hands in which to pre-
pare exhibits for the Royal Show.
THE FUTURE OF farming in Aus-
tralia is very much in the hands of the
dedicated youth in the industry. So
anything like the P. and 0.-sponsored
six-month tours of Britain for selected
young farmers (one from each State
annually) rewarding dedication, and at
the same time broadening the experience
of keen young men in the industry, is to
be commended. The annual pre-Show
tours run by the Royal Agricultural
Societies in the various States (and paid
for by Shell) represent another solid
contribution to farming by outside in-
dustries. Bulletin representatives have
been much impressed by the strength of
the Young Farmers’ Clubs, whose mem-
bers seem always to be on hand to ex-
plain things, display their stock, and
so forth.
The shipping company has recently
been choosing the six young farmers
whose tour begins next March.

Don't be so hard
on foxes
BY SONG AND story at mother’s knee
we learnt that the fox, Vulpes vulpes,
is a sly marauder and odious slayer of
the young. With such preconceptions of
this creature’s character we have en-
couraged our governments and local
authorities to proclaim the fox a noxious
animal. We happily subscribe to a costly
bounty on its scalp. Many farmers still
believe that foxes are responsible for a
large proportion of the fifteen million
lambs that are lost before marking
each year. While this view prevails the
real reasons for the lamb mortality will
not be grasped and appropriate steps
taken to stop it.
Wildlife scientists now dub the fox
an “opportunist scavenger.” When this
interpretation was first expressed three
or four years ago the evidence was
mainly circumstantial. Examination of
the stomach contents of some hundreds
of foxes shot throughout the year dis-
closed nothing that looked like fresh
lamb. Post-mortems on mauled dead
lambs supplied further indirect evidence.
Almost all the lambs were clearly dead
before being chewed and, where the
results of the post-mortems were not
conclusive, it might be surmised that
the lambs were at the point of death
when attacked. But, because of the
difficulty of accounting of all lambs
born, it remained a distinct possibility
that a large number of those that dis-
appeared were taken alive by foxes and
completely consumed in or near their
lairs far away from the lambing pad-
dock.
Room for such doubts is even less
now that direct observational evidence
of the fox’s general unwillingness to
adopt a predatory role has been ob-
tained. Members of CSIRO and the
South Australian Department of Agri-
culture joined forces to maintain day-
and-night watch for nearly a fortnight
over lambing flocks on the Research
Centre at Minnipa, S.A.
A hide was built, and constantly
staffed by the vigilantes, beside a six-
acre paddock that was fenced off near
scrub in which foxes were known to be
plentiful. It was stocked with Merino
ewes about to lamb. Altogether, 44
lambs were born in this small field
during the study period, which was
arranged to coincide with a full moon.
All ewes, and their lambs when born,
were marked with large brands and re-
flecting tape so that they could be
identified at night. Under the strict
system of recording that was followed,
the chances of a lamb disappearing
without being noticed were very small.
Powerful binoculars, a spotlight, and
two-way radio completed the equip-
ment.
Neither the sheep nor the foxes gave
the slightest sign of being aware of the

surveillance. Both carried on their nor-
mal behaviour. Even the spotlight, care-
fully used, did not seem to disturb the
foxes. The observational team is con-
fident that little or no fox activity could
have passed unnoticed. No foxes entered
the paddock during daylight, but as
many as eleven sightings were made in
the course of one night. The length
of each visit varied from a few minutes
to one and three-quarter hours. The
number of different foxes involved is
unknown, but on one occasion five
were in eyeshot. Intense watch was
also kept on a neighboring paddock of
200 acres which contained 450 lambing
ewes.
One healthy lamb in the big pad-
dock was seen being killed by a fox.
Some doubt surrounds what exactly
happened to a newborn twin in the
small paddock. Its birth was not
actually observed, but it must have
been shortly before a fox was seen
eating it. Being a twin, this lamb could
have been born dead or dying. The
point could not be decided because the
fox carried off the remains. In addition,
a very diffident, and unsuccessful,
attempt on the life of a vigorous lamb
was witnessed. Apart from these in-
stances all other fox activity was con-
fined to scavenging for after-births
and carrion.
For the most part the foxes were shy
rather than sly in their approach to
the sheep. The merest show of offensive
action by a ewe was enough to cause
hasty withdrawal. On one occasion
assertive behaviour by a lamb was
enough to send a fox scurrying away l'
Perhaps the most telling observation of
all was that generally both the ewes
and the lambs ignored the foxes and
seemed to be quite unafraid of them.
They allowed them to approach within
a few feet as if knowing them to be
harmless. In contrast, the arrival of an
errant Border Collie dog caused con-
siderable consternation in the flock.
After roaming around a while it found
a dying lamb and carried it off for
burial.
While this study has not exonerated
the fox completely, it has shown that
ewes are not so upset by foxes that
they mis-mother their lambs. Earlier
studies by Dr. Alexander at the CSIRO
Field Station, Armidale, N.S.W., pro-
duced plenty of evidence that mis-
mothering, for whatever reason, leads
to most of the lamb mortality. It would
also seem that there are “killer” foxes,
i.e., odd individuals which apparently
realise that lambs are easy game. On
the other hand, it could be that any
fox is driven to this quite uncharacter-
istic degree of boldness by intense
hunger.
If this is so, rather than invest time
and effort in hunting foxes it may be
better to feed them around lambing
time by leaving carrion in the pad-
docks. For most of the year foxes are
farmers’ friends.

BOOKS
A new look at Australia as the
contradictory strains fuse
By R. N. SPANN
Southern Exposure. Photographs by
David Beal, text by Donald Horne.
Collins. $5.50.
THIS IS ONE of these larger-than-
usual books with 102 pictures and a
40-page text. As one who tends to
inspect such publications in bookshops
but not take them home, I am not an
ideal reviewer.
However, its authors have made good
their claim that this is not “the ordinary
kind of picture-book on Australia.
The photographs are each designed to
make a particular point about Austra-
lian life, and some of them are brilliant.
The text is also much more than a
comment on the pictures.
There are chapters on history, social
life, “mates,” “non-mates” (mainly
Aborigines), “bosses,” and the emerg-
ing Australia of the 19605. The cen-
tral themes echo those of “The Lucky
Country,” though there has been some
mellowing. The sense of catastrophe has
faded, and not only because it does
not suit a picture-book. Mr. Horne now
dares to hope that Australia’s attitudes
may be being gently re-ordered toward
something more correspondent with its
problems.
Perhaps it is too much a Sydney
text—even Sidney Nolati gets mis-
spelled Sydney. Most of the epithets
that Mr. Horne applies to his home-
base, indifferent, empiricist, hedonistic,
also apply to his typical Australian.
Melbourne is more “English” and
ideological, Adelaide “English” and
prim, Hobart placid and backward-
looking. It’s as if they did not really
belong. Certainly this is mainly a text
about urban Australians, which Mr.
Horne would justify by saying: that is
what most of us are and we had better
start recognising the fact.
Mr. Beal does justice to city life but
also roams more freely, with fine pic-
tures of wine-growers and drovers, of
the spurred feet of an outback stock-
man, and a very atmospheric fish-eye
view of Ayers Rock. His most compel-
ling item of contemporary sociology is,
however, the girl with the empty beer-
glass safely stowed (turn first to page
126).
Inevitably, in a short commentary,
there are many sentences that begin
“Australians are,” without space for
qualifications. Under this guise a num-
ber of different types are presented.
There is the sport-loving, matey kind
Cricket fan
of Australian, easy and informal, with
a pantheistic wing that shows an “extra-
ordinary identification with their skies
and seas, their beaches and mountains”
(at these moments, Mr. Horne’s nor-
mally excellent, spare, and direct way
of writing collapses into some lushy
sunbaked purple patches). But Austra-
lians are also “the most suburban
people in the world,” so devoted to
homesmanship that there’s often not
much time left for anything else.
I do not think that the book quite
shows how these various characters come
together, though Mr. Horne will not
admit that they are different people.
One of his interesting theses is that “if
Australians are all becoming middle-
class now they are becoming middle-
class in a relaxed way that has much of
the old devil-may-care about it, without
the belligerence.” The contradictory
strains in Australian society are fusing.
There is an unspoken assumption, a
very Australian assumption, that this
fusion is a good thing. As the wowsers
and roughs depart, let the Methodists
and Irish-Catholics join to bless the
Sunday surfriders.
Mr. Horne thinks very well of the
ordinary Australian. What worries him
are the leaders, for this is a country
that definitely doesn’t get the Govern-
ment it deserves. As in his earlier book,
he deftly turns on its head the stale
argument that an over-egalitarian
people cuts down its tall poppies, and
says instead that it has few tall poppies
to cut down. As he once bluntly put
it, “The people who run Australia are
not much good”, or now, in more
kindly terms, “In Australia there is not
much imagination on top, but ordinary
Australians remain highly adaptable.”
This could be claimed as only a new
version of the old myth. As a friend of
mine said, “If Australians don’t cut
down the tall poppies, Donald Horne
writes them down.” In a way he is
being very Australian in hymning the
ordinary bloke and reserving his barbs
for the politicians and the intellectuals.
His answer would be that other com-
mentators habitually lay the blame for
deficiencies of leadership on mass
mediocrity. “Australia is one of the few
countries in the world where the aspira-
tions of ordinary people are the main
concern of satire.”
I am not quite clear to what Mr.
Horne attributes the inadequacy of our
elites. Partly, his argument is that we
have only just begun to need imagina-
tive leaders. Till recently Australia has
been a provincial society, muddling
through on a mixture of self-confident
amateurism and second-hand ideas bor-
rowed from overseas. However, at times
he also suggests that we used to be
Non-mate on a rideabout at Coober Pedy


more imaginative than we are now,
and that our elites have lately lost their
sense of direction. No doubt these two
views can be reconciled.
On the whole, the author puts up a
very good case for the non-elite Aus-
tralian, in spite of touches of defiant
philistinism about “featurism” and
timber veneers and some nonsense about
the “existential” (inconsequential?)
ways of the young. He is prepared to
criticise the Australian majority for its
inattentiveness and superficiality; at the
same time he wants to dissociate him-
self from other minority critics, being
aware of their inattentiveness and super-
ficiality, especially when they look
Britain-wards (whether to curtsy or
read the “New Statesman”), or for that
matter America-wards.
Indeed Donald Horne is once again
idiosyncratically but authentically Aus-
tralian in asking for a “fair go” for
the ordinary Australian, this time from
the elites who excuse themselves at his
expense. He and David Beal, who hasn’t
had quite a fair go in this review, have
prepared a picture-book that I should
buy, if The Bulletin had not given me
a copy.
Forever Wooster
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
The World of Jeeves. P. G. Wodehouse.
Herbert Jenkins. $3.85.
IT’S MARVELLOUS HOW the Jeeves
stories stand up. Here’s the Omnibus
again (“This trackless desert of print
which we see before us, winding on
and on into the purple distance,” to
quote the Master himself on its first
appearance in 1932) with some new
additions indistinguishable from the vin-
tage material. Nothing changes in the
world of Wodehouse, anyway. Bertie
never gets a day older, nor Aunt Agatha
a mite kinder; the Drones Club is intact,
with no lady members, servant trouble,
or occasion to raise the subscription.
There the members sit looking out of
the window and watching the traffic
go up one side of the street and down
the other. No question of Pall Mall
being one way.
What is the secret of so enduring an
appeal, by no means confined to these
islands? Wodehouse told me once that
his Japanese royalties minister substan-
tially toward keeping the wolf from
the door in Remsenburg, Long Island,
where he resides. We had a long
laugh over a Japanese translator work-
ing on “The Great Sermon Handicap.”
As for the Germans—in the late war
they actually sent an agent over here
wearing spats. He was, of course, appre-
hended at once. What a pity, I thought
at the time, not to leave him at large
for a little while to see whether, on
arriving in London, he asked the way
to the Drones Club, or thought to escape
notice in restaurants by throwing bread
about.
Foreigners, I suppose, like Wodehouse
for the same reason that they like the
Forsyte Saga—because it recalls the
England of their dreams; before the
Rolling Stones, Harold Wilson, and
family-planning had marred this other
paradise. At home, too, the dream has
its devotees; Wooster on the telly washes
away the taste of “Up the Junction”
and “Till Death Us Do Part.” It is
an interesting, and to me very pleasing,
sociological fact that during the period
of Wodehouse’s wartime troubles, when
every public voice, from the “Mirror”
to “The Times Literary Supplement,”
not to mention the BBC and the Beef-
steak Club, testified against him, his
books enjoyed a record sale. Public
wrath is nearly always, in my experi-
ence, a studio audience. So, for that
matter, is public adulation.
The structure of the stories is in-
variable; Bertie gets into trouble when
there is a coldness between him and
Jeeves over some article of attire which
he insists on wearing and Jeeves con-
siders to be in poor taste. We are
given to understand that Jeeves is
right, but none the less Bertie persists
in his unrighteousness. Retribution
follows in the shape of some awful mess
into which his wilfulness has led him;
Jeeves, who has been holding aloof,
steps in at the last moment and sorts
everything out; the offending article of
attire is relinquished, and the old re-
lationship between gentleman and
gentleman’s gentleman re-established.
Actually, the origins of Bertie and
Jeeves may be traced in the school
stories with which Wodehouse began
his writing career. His hero, Mike, is
a superb cricketer, splendidly good-
looking, and altogether excellent in
character and capability. In the light
of his experience of life Wodehouse
transforms his paragon into Bertie, a
sort of inspired idiot with a comfort-
able income, nothing to do, and only
an occasional aunt to contend with in
the way of family entanglements. Con-
trasted with Mike is Psmith, a sophis-
ticated villain, up to all sorts of tricks,
and by no means an upholder of Mike’s
code of good sportsmanship and virtu-
ous behaviour. He becomes Jeeves,
Bertie’s man, with his vast erudition,
intellectual subtlety, and inexhaustible
deviousness.
Both Bertie and Jeeves have been,
as we say in television, “frozen”; they
belong—in so far as they belong to
any period of earthly time at all—to
the early years of the twentieth century,
before the home fires were kept burning
or the long, long trail was a-winding;
let alone before Beveridge and the Fes-
tival of Britain. At a touch of khaki
the whole dream would dissolve, as it
would at a mere mention of nationalis-
ing the means of production. The
furthest Bertie ever went in the direc-
tion of Left-wing politics was to hear
an oration at Hyde Park Corner which
led him, on returning home, to remark:
“What’s bread, Jeeves? Tell me about
bread.” What would have become of
them if they had lived through the
years of their lives instead of just being?
I once raised the question with Wode-
house, pointing out that Jeeves, almost
certainly a Labor voter, might well have
been adopted as a candidate in 1945,
say in one of the nearer London suburbs
like Lewisham, and got elected to Par-
liament. Subsequently he would have
been a natural for the House of Lords.
One sees him as Lord Jeeves and chair-
man of the Electricity Board. For
Bertie, on the other hand, I fear the
way would have been only downhill,
with money running out, the Drones
closed, and most of his friends living in
Tangier or the Channel Islands. I say
goodbye to him in the bar of the
National Liberal Club, sipping a pale
ale and holding forth to anyone who
will listen on the case for closing Eton
and turning the place over to a
psychedelic discotheque, what ho! what
ho!
All such speculations, I could see,
were lost on Wodehouse. As sensible
to suggest to the Celestial Powers that
Eve before the Fall might come in
time to need some Royal Jelly, or to
Cervantes that Don Quixote might find
a useful outlet for his romanticism in
the activities of the Outward Bound
P. G. Wodehouse... faraway look
Trust. The Master’s eye, I noticed, had
a ruminative and faraway look as,
indeed, it often has. Age cannot wither
them, nor custom stale their infinite
monotony, he seemed to be saying of
his creations, and, of course, I agreed.
In Remsenburg, L. 1., I calculate, it is
half-past nine in the morning. Break-
fast is over, the “New York Times”
has been cursorily-—oh, so cursorily!—
glanced at; the dogs must await their
walk for a few hours yet. A pipe is lit
and a piece of paper fastened in the
typewriter, as every morning religiously

Painful
Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors —including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved —even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course
will convince you.
Ask your family chemist for Varemoid.

Books in brief
Practical sympathy
Vanishing Cornwall. Daphne du
Maurier. Gollancz. $5.10.
FROM HER COUNTY by adoption
Daphne du Maurier gathered a good
deal of the background for her novels.
She has now tried to repay her debt
by recounting Cornwall’s history, from
King Arthur and Tristan through the
series of its enterprises, tin-mining,
fishing, even smuggling, now all unre-
warding or impossible. This leaves only
tourism, which Miss du Maurier and
Cornwall both face with some distaste
and trepidation.
As she says, “When coves and beaches
covered with ice - cream cartons,
cigarette-packets, corn-plasters, and con-
traceptives daunt the intending swim-
mer, and the sound of radio, speed-
boat, and barking dogs pollutes the air,”
elderly natives by birth or by adoption
can live on memories.
But Miss du Maurier can see areas
for compromise between the extreme
nationalists who want to get people into
black kilts, speaking the old Cornish
language in their own Parliament and
those who regard every widening of a
road, every bingo-hall and bowling-
alley, as progress. She outlines her
plans for getting the best of both worlds
with a good deal of practical sympathy.
French curiosities
The Wandering Jew and Other Stories.
Guillaume Apollinaire. Hart-Davis.
$5.30.
THIS IS THE FIRST English transla-
tion of the collection of short stories
published in 1910, many of which first
saw the light in fugitive little Parisian
literary journals. They were caviar to
the general public 60 years ago, and
doubtless still are. Deliberate perverse-
ness is in fashion again, though it is
solemn and selfconscious these days.
Selfconscious Apollinaire might have
been, but solemn he certainly wasn’t,
any more than Wilde, Beardsley, Huys-
mans, Jarry, or the others of the mauve
fn-de-siecle.
Apollinaire is best known for his
Symbolist poems and his fanfaronades
(long discredited as serious art criti-
cism) on behalf of Picasso, Matisse,
Braque, and the rest of the avant-
garde painters of his age. He is also
celebrated as the coiner of the useful
word “surrealist” to describe one of his
verse dramas, and for being wrongly
suspected of implication in the theft of
the Mona Lisa from the Louvre.
The short stories are slighter stuff
than the poems. He tossed them off at
intervals to earn a few francs when his
main source of income came from dig-
ging erotica out of the Bibliotheque
Nationale and writing mock-scholarly
introductions to the Marquis de Sade,
Aretino, and “Les Memoires de Fanny
Hill.” The stories won him a coterie
reputation, which was really all they
deserved, until Apollinaire was re-
discovered and reassessed in the past
15 years or so.
Apollinaire is now apparently an “in”
author in France. There are courses
on him at the Sorbonne and at least
eight volumes about his life and works
have appeared in French or English.
Flis poems are seriously studied but
criticism of his prose work is simply
breaking a butterfly on a wheel. These
stories—witty, mocking, precious, and
macabre—are curiosities of French
literature, and very diverting ones, too.
They are also well translated.
Homer's Troy, Pooles ’ mystery
One Passion, Two Loves: the Schlie-
manns of Troy. Lynn and Gray
Poole. Gollancz. $5.10.
THIS IS ONE FROM the second-
drawer of American scholarship. The
Pooles’ biography is earnest, humorless,
and, no doubt, accurate. They did,
however, choose a fascinating subject.
Heinrich Schliemann spent half his life
amassing a fortune and battling sick-
ness so that he could undertake an
expedition to prove that Homer’s Troy
was fact, not fiction. As a last requisite,
he decided he needed a young wife, to
replace the one he had, and one who
would resemble Helen of Troy as he
visualised her.
He found his young Greek bride, and
a remarkable woman, as well as a hard-
working archaeologist, she proved. How-
ever, all the Pooles’ diligent digging
could not solve the great mystery of the
Schliemanns: how they managed to
smuggle the gold jewellery and treasure
they found in Troy out of Turkey
without the knowledge of the authori-
ties. This they did from the highest
motive of not wanting their finds
broken up or stolen, but how they did
it is a secret which died with them.
The sequel to the Schliemanns’
story, what happened to the treasure
during World War 11, also remains a
mystery. During the war the Germans
hid the Trojan objects in four or five
different places. When the Russians
took over East Berlin, the gold jewellery
was found in a bunker under the Berlin
Zoological Station. It was to be taken
to Moscow, but whether it arrived or
not the Russians have not yet revealed.

In praise of
a Hardy strain
of burgundy
ONCE UPON A TIME, long long ago,
when matured reds were available and
cost only a few shillings a bottle, the
people drank a wine called burgundy.
They drink burgundy today. But they
do not drink the same kind of wine.
The older-style reds were great big
gutsy wonders, as full blown as a Gaiety
Girl heaving her huge thighs across an
Edwardian postcard. Wines full of
flavor and character, as smooth as an
annual report. Flatulent wines, that
really didn’t care if you heard them.
Today, we go more for a Twiggy kind
of wine. Delicate, delightful, with
almost ethereal qualities. Quick-
developing, here today, gone tomorrow
wines. Charming, vital, with never a
hint of blowsiness. You can’t have
decolletage without breasts.
The change has come about for
several reasons: the increased public
demand for the lighter style, the wine-
maker’s real worry to present his wines
quicker, superior grape-growing and
wine-making techniques, and the genu-
ine general understanding that a wine
can be full of flavor and style without
having to have the kitchen sink thrown
in, too.
Many of the old wines were horrors.
“Excellent port material” is the wine-
taster’s cliche for them, and it describes
many of them so well. But there was,
and is, one line that has always been
represented by high-quality wine,
whether of the old style or new.
The Thomas Hardy St. Thomas bur-
gundies go back at least to the ’4os.
This has always been a blended wine,
though in the ’4os much of the material
came from the Hunter. Consequently,
the odd examples were not very big
at all.
The line really got going in the early
’sos. The material came mainly from
McLaren Vale and the Hunter and
Eden Valleys. The 1952, of which there
wasn’t much, was rather porty with a
slight licorice taste. But the balance
was good and the after-taste agree-
able. The Bin 752 of 1953 was of the
same character, though it had more
finesse. Like a brainy younger brother.
The 1954 Bin 811, a famous old wine,
got a plug in my very first column in
1962. “There have been lately two
burgundies of great merit. One, the
1954 811, is no longer available from
the makers, but you may find some
around. I loved this wine, a great
Falstaffian fellow with a huge nose, high
color, and full body.”
Though I still enjoy this wine today,
I am not as overawed as I used to be.
And tasting notes of a bottle recently
opened show the decline of the affair
as well as a loss of literary flow. “. . .
big blackberry style—very full, heavy,
old character—great big pungent thing.”
But still a very good wine and a real
pleasure to drink.
I also mentioned its successor, the
1955 894. This was winning all sorts
of Golds at the time and I noted its
future availability. It was released 12
months ago, and swallowed in one gulp
by the whale of the wine-drinking pub-
lic. I hope you got your share. But
1956 was a disastrous year and I have
never seen a ’56 St. Thomas. Perhaps
there wasn’t one. In 1957 there was a
significant change. The C 35 was still
a big wine, and had a trace of hard-
ness that it has not lost to this day, but
it was lighter and had none of the
licorice or port character at all. Next
year’s wine, the 184 of 1958, was again
much lighter, and matured into an ele-
gant clean, dry red that is now begin-
ning to fade.
Many good wines of this new, lighter
style followed. Some of them are still
around in one or two hotels and stores
and in private cellars.
The 1959 Bin 266, like the 184, con-
tained some Coonawarra Shiraz; of the
1960 vintage, two bins were released,
the C 315 and Bin 405. Actually, they
were the same wine, though they didn’t
taste the same. The 405 was bottled
fairly early, and now, of course, has
pronounced bottle age. The C 315 was
kept in cask much longer, has picked
up more oak character, and is still
developing, even now, in the bottle.
The same thing happened in 1961 and
1962, the Bin numbers being C 354 (late
bottled) and 414 in 1961 and C 396
(late bottled) and 426 in 1962.
These are all very good wines. I
particularly like the 405 and the 426
as drinking wines now, and would very
much like to have some of the C 396
to lay down. Incidentally, the Bin 504,
sometimes seen in New South Wales,
was a printer’s error and is actually the
405.
After the 1962 vintage I seemed to
have lost count for a while until I
renewed acquaintance this week.
Most of the wines of the ’6os are still
to be found here and there, and all
are recommended. At this stage they
will probably be found under the Re-
serve Bin Label, though at one time
they were all the standard St. Thomas
blend. Hardy’s have made a practice of
bringing out the wine as a standard
commercial, and then putting the Re-
serve Bin sticker on that part of the
blend they retained for extra aging.
Which seems very fair to me.
Now a departure. Such are the sales
of red wine there is no hope for reten-

tion of any part of the blend. The St.
Thomas burgundy will continue to be
sold each year. The present wine is the
1964 Bin 443, a blend of McLaren
Vale, Eden Valley, Coonawarra, and
Hunter wines. This wine is young and
undeveloped, but has very good possi-
bilities. It has a hint of Coonawarra
on the nose, a pleasant soft, round
palate with the McLaren Vale domin-
ant, and a clean, soft finish.
In addition, Hardy’s will be market-
ing a Reserve Bin burgundy under a
quite separate label, a plain, straight-
forward, black on buff account of the
wine. I may take a little credit for this
(if any is to be doled out), since I first
requested this plain simple approach
to their bin-wine labelling way back
in ’6l. I also suggested that they drop
the Tintara label and stick to Thomas
Hardy. No charge made.
The new RB burgundy is Bin 421
of the 1963 vintage. It has seen two
years in large wood and this is evident
on the palate. The wine has a lovely
young fruit character which will
develop tremendous flavor in a couple
of years or so. Definitely one to lay
down, it will last longer than the 443,
though it will not mature as quickly.
Shocking waste to drink it now.
However, don’t get the idea that to
store indefinitely means to improve in-
definitely. Undoubtedly, our best red
wines need age. And we all know that
we can only buy young wines today.
But don’t keep and keep the St. Thomas
burgundies.
All the above wines are in my own
cellar. Knowledge of them over the
years indicates to me that a couple of
years’ storage is enough, the wine being
consumed when five-six years old. The
811 and 894 had arrived by 1960, the
184 by 1963, the 266 was good drink-
ing in 1964. Not that the wines then
deteriorate. Far from it. But they don’t
do anything much more.
The sons of the sons of Thomas
Hardy and Sons are delightful people.
Big Tom is now managing director,
though that young middle-aged man,
Uncle Ken, still sits in the chair. Over
in Sydney, Jim Hardy is at the helm.
Jim is a famous yachtsman, many
times State and Australian champion,
and present world champion of the 505
class. He is at the moment in England
for the World Tempest titles, and will
look in on the America’s Cup challenge
on the way back (he was in the cock-
pit of Gretel).
One thing is for sure. After the races,
they will be drinking Hardy wines. At
one stage they were not, and this was
the reason, Jim said, that they were all
sick. I’ve mentioned this before, but
to me the classic wine analysis was one
he made. I had shown him a top wine.
Jim nosed, tasted, sipped, rolled, sucked,
and swallowed. He put his head back
and closed his eyes. He opened them to
gaze into the skies. He returned to
earth and mortal man.
“Well,” he said, “it’s very easy on
the gums.”

Stepping up civil aid
I wish to congratulate The Bulletin
for its article by Peter Samuel entitled
“What Role for the Australians in Viet-
nam?” (8., August 19). This article
pointed out very clearly the necessary
job that the Australian soldiers and
civilians are doing in Vietnam and what
needs to be done to make this con-
tribution more efficient and worth while.
Canberra politicians, from both sides
of the House, tend to overlook the very
real role Australia is playing in winning
the hearts and minds of the people in
Phuoc Tuy province amid the larger
debate over conscription and the bomb-
ing of the North. We are doing a good
job at the moment, but we can do
more if the Holt Government would be
prepared to show a little bit more initia-
tive and a little less reliance on the
American policy in Vietnam. Mr. Holt
has repeatedly pointed out that we have
more to lose in Vietnam than do the
Americans. Therefore, if this be the
case, let him step up the civil aid along
the lines suggested in the Samuel article.
Only by doing this can we truly count
ourselves as part of Asia.

Sweden's way
In your article “Australia’s Running,
Jumping, and Standing Still Defence
Policy” you compare our current de-
fence effort with that of various West
European countries.
One of the nations mentioned was
Sweden, which, with a smaller popu-
lation, supports, a bigger army than
Australia’s, as well as a “huge trained
reserve.”
You did not mention that Sweden
also has a world-ranking Air Force
and a reasonably sized Navy. All three
services are heavily armed with the
most modern weapons. Weapons made
in Sweden are favored over imported
goods, even including supersonic air-
craft.
Sweden could be regarded as a
parallel to Australia in several ways.
The personal standard of living is about
the same. It is a nation heavily depen-
dent on international trade. It is a
small country with historically un-
friendly and much larger neighbors.
It would seem that we in Australia
have something to learn from a country
like Sweden, which seems to be able to
make more effective use of available
resources than we do.
When we look outwards, we see only
America, Britain, and Japan, all major

No funds for NLF
In an article headed “Treachery” (8.,
August 19) it was stated that the Mel-
bourne University Administration sent
a circular asking for aid to the Viet
Cong to monthly paid staff members
through their pay envelopes. As the
person who signed the letter circulated
to the staff, allow me to correct this
fantastic distortion of facts.
The circular was sent to monthly
paid staff as part of a “Civil Aid for
Vietnam” appeal. Through appeals to
the public (through the newspapers),
to students, and to staff, the Students’
Representative Council aimed at raising
money for civil aid for North and South
Vietnam.
All money collected was distributed
through International Red Cross (to
North Vietnam) and through World
University Service (to South Vietnam).
The procedure of appealing to the staff
is one that has been adopted a number
of times by World University Service.
The money was raised for civil aid
for North and South Vietnam—not for
the National Liberation Front.

With regrets
The Bulletin’s review of the Elizabethan
Opera Season (8., August 5) contained
some references to Miss Marcella Reale
which were not related to her perform-
ance and which were not warranted. We
regret any embarrassment or distress
these may have caused her.
In defence of Canberra
I cannot remember ever reading such
a page of nonsense as “A Tourist’s
Nightmare of Canberra” (8., Aug. 26).
That the standard of buildings cannot
compare with Brasilia or the Opera
House I agree, but this is a poor coun-
try, a country beset with the most
awful problems.
The mediocre standard is set in the
first place by the idiotic States’
Righters, wherein only the minimum
must be spent on Canberra, the window
of Australia. Even private enterprise,
which has shown some interest, is to be
stifled by the insistence on imposing
stamp duties and other deterrents,
largely on a people who have no vote
and no control in local affairs.
As to the War Memorial: I am no
lover of the RSL (N.S.W. pattern), and
agree the building holds much that is
trash, but even I, a Pom, cannot walk
through without a deep feeling of re-
spect for the blokes who didn’t come
back. I would prefer to see portion of
the building devoted to the pioneers, but
please, leave the Hall of Memory. I
don’t know what the years 1941-44
mean to Australians, but for my part
the Hall of Memory means much.
I am no judge of Art, but the statue
and windows give me more than any of
the modern objets d’art. As for Parlia-
ment House, the G-G residence and in-
deed the PM’s lodge . . . haven’t you
heard ... we are a poor country and
must rely on the pensioners to pay for
our defence!
As a tourist attraction, Canberra may
not compare with Rome, Venice, Paris,
or, I hope, the Gold Coast, but I feel
if every schoolchild were to visit Can-
berra there would be more thought to
the future of Australia and less on
States’ rights. Suitability as a place to
live: I’ve lived in Sydney and Wollon-
gong, I’ve seen Melbourne and Bris-
bane ... I chose Canberra.
The only bright spot your writer
appears to see is the red paint, nude
drawings, and boing-boing merchants
of a teenage nightspot. Maybe he could
find only one because there is only need
for one. Indeed, your writer’s enthusi-
asm for this one spot suggests that next
time you send a man, not a boy to do
a man’s job.

Not invited
I thank you for your interest in this
High School’s recent Art Exhibition at
the Darlinghurst Galleries as shown by
the publication of Miss Daphne Guin-
ness’ article on page 6 of the August 26
issue. I appreciate the favorable and
sympathetic tone of the article and the
genuine interest shown in the students
whose work was exhibited.
I do, however, regret the insinuation
behind the comment on the Director-
General of Education, Dr. Wyndham.
The Department of Education was rep-
resented by Mr. D. Graham, Deputy
Director of Secondary Education. I
am sure you will appreciate that Dr.
Wyndham could not possibly attend all
functions to which he is invited, especi-
ally in Education Week. I do know
that he is vitally interested in the work
going on in the Art Department of this
school and I regret that your article
should infer that we at this school
thought otherwise.
At no time did I inform Miss Guin-
ness either that Dr. Wyndham was per-
sonally invited or that he had not re-
plied. No one else on my staff could
have spoken with authority on either
matter, and certainly no one had my
authority to do so.

CRAVEN FILTER
belongs to the world of today
Sailing a twelve metre yacht off Sydney Heads, or Newport,
Rhode Island, is strictly for men only —men of experience. It
is not a sport for the very young. Much the same with Craven
Filter cigarettes—they are not intended to appeal to everybody.
Craven Filter is especially blended to give mild, satisfying
