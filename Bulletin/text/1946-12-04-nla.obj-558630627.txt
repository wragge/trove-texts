LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE
“THE OADS.”
Epsom stands the old ivy-covered mansion known as
The Oaks, surrounded by its magnificent trees. In 1788 the
fee simple of the estate was purchased by the Earl of Derby,
who greatly improved the property and added the famous round
towers. This hospitable nobleman kept open house at The Oaks,
and at a dinner party during 1778 the earl and his friends
decided to found the famous race which derives its name from
the earl’s house. The Oaks was run for 4,500 sovereigns by
three-year-old 'fillies, at the Epsom Summer Meeting on the Friday
following the Derby. After Lord Derby died in 1834, Sir Charles
Gray, one of Britain’s greatest Premiers, was an occupier of this
stately home of England.

CONSUL FOR BOLIVIA.
The locusts have eaten fifty of the years
of Luis Amadeo Pares. Mr. Pares mind-
eth not. He is sitting up in bed in his
room in Brisbane with a writing-pad on
his knees and about him the haze of
asthma cigarettes. In the smoke, he looks
like a kookaburra. At any moment he
will burst out laughing.
As Mr. Pares is a musician and the
book he is writing is to be entitled
I Fiddled the Years Away, the room can
be symbolically furnished with violins.
Many violins, of all makes and sizes.
One has been constructed by a giant,
for giants ; by a bearded Scotch farmer
for his Gargantuan Queensland sons; a
monstrous musical engine made of
Queensland hardwood and cowhide, with
somewhere deep inside it the thinnest
ghost of a note. If you can heave it
up to your shoulder, and scrape the bow
hard enough, after a while you may hear
something coming.
Stand that one in a corner, or let Mr.
Pares prop it against his knees for a
writing table. For the symbolic effect-
later Mr. Pares is to conduct a fantastic
orchestra of a whole thousand of the
things—hang some more violins round
the walls of the room; let them dangle
from the ceiling like hams in the smoke.
The year is 1943, and the whole world
has gone crazy. Mr. Pares* spares it a
thought; “the world burns.” So. But he
can do nothing about it. His health, as
he is pleased to call it, debars him from
working in the war effort. But discard
any little-man-what-now ideas. Mr. Pares
stands six-feet-one in his son’s socks ; if
there are holes in them it won’t worry
Mr. Pares. He is thinking about life —
and about the life of Luis Amadeo
Pares. It is wrong, he concludes, to think
of age as “going downhill.” It is an
ascent. After the half-century “one starts
to feel the grade,” but “up the mountain-
side the air is lighter, rare, less contami-
nated, and at the summit it should be
better still.” If you prefer it that way, go
up backwards.
And how do you like the scenery back
there? What do you make of it? After
all, what is it?
Mr. Pares has no doubt whatever about
that' He would dignify it, perhaps, with
the name of comedy. Looking at it with
Mr. Pares, the reader might designate it
a riotous slapstick farce. The terms are
immaterial. Comedy or farce, the effect
is belly laughter; straight from, the solar
plexus.
Mr. Pares looks back to 1893, when
his father settled at Mareeba, North
Queensland, in the neighborhood of a
brewery. Luis is then ninety days old;
at twelve years he is at work in the
brewery; scaling up into a tower loft to
do the duty of turning on a sprinkler,
and then stripping off to enjoy a cooling
shower in the water that will splash from
his bony frame and go down to become
so much the richer beer.
Three camps of blacks are a large
proportion of the Pards neighbors. For
the entertainment of visitors from else-
where, they are easily induced by Senor
Pares, sen., to stage corroborees in his
front garden. Enthusiasts, inspired by a
liberal gorge and a tobacco handout, they
are more easily started than stopped. Gor-
roboree keepum on big fella runabout
after the visitors have long departed. It
is not entirely art for art’s sake. The
performers, too, demand their entertain-
ment. At last they get it. Pares, sen.,
roars out in his nightshirt and hurls at
them a string of Catalonian epithets. The
corroboreeans enjoy it immensely, “Yuc-
kie! Old Man corroboree!” They flee
shrieking, and Old Night rings down
the curtain.
In time Mareeba has its proper theatre;
a local play by local talent; Senor Pares
and a now towsle-headed, lanky Luis in
the cast. Luis’s cue. He strides forth,
feces the audience, is struck petrified and
dumb. Loud promptings from the
prompter. Petrified silence from Luis.
Enter Senor Pares hissing, “You fool!”
In paternal rage, he turns Luis in the right
direction and plants a kick that lifts him
clean off-stage.
Suspecting music in his offspring Senor
Pares buys him a violin, and m Mareeba
and elsewhere, including some time with
Cyril Monk in Sydney, Luis learns to play
it; and so, with turns of varied dead-
beat work whenever he is broke, which is
usually, Luis fiddles his way about
Queensland, until eventually he is in Bris-
bane, has there established the Hall of
the Muses, and has acquired the splendid
diplomatic status of Consul for Bolivia.
Mentioned to Luis by one of the Hall s
habitues, a French count who is unable
to take the post himself because he is in
the employ of the Queensland Govern-
ment, the job appeals as “having its humor-
ous side.” Becoming diplomatically
proficient by attending receptions put on
by his fellow-Consuls, Luis looks up
Bolivia’s national day, and on it himself
stages a reception at which Brisbane’s
other Consular representatives, civic heads
and officials from Government House,do
honor to Bolivia at his expense. Next
day he writes to La Paz extolling the
magnitude and success of the first Boliv-
ian reception in Queensland’s capital city,
adding from the newspaper report the
names of all present; an impressive list,
but, he feels, perhaps not quite impressive
enough. He completes it with another
clipping from the paper —a long list of
names of citizens who had attended the
races on the same day.
Without being unduly disturbed—he is
never that Consul Pares notices that
each letter he receives from Bolivia bears
the name of a fresh Minister, “who would
doubtless soon join the long illustrious
line of assassinated politicians.” It makes
no difference in Brisbane, where Bolivia’s
Consul carries on, always in the hope
that one day, perhaps, he will set eyes
on a Bolivian. So, naturally, he is de-
lighted when eventually one claiming
allegiance to that country calls on him.
The caller looks a shade seedy, and sus-
picion rises in the Consul’s breast when
a greeting outburst in Spanish brings a
strongly Hibernian response. The rest of
the encounter, and of Mr. Pares’s -career
as Consul, may be best told from his ac-
count of the bankruptcy proceedings in
which, unfortunately, he subsequently
was called on to play the leading part;
“How did you entertain all these per-
sondgcs? 99
“In the usual way: a bottle of whisky,
a dozen of beer and a few sandwiches.”
“Who paid for them?”
“I hope the Bolivian Government will.
“Does the Bolivian Government make
you any allowances?”
“I don’t know, they don’t say.”
“How do you manage when Bolivians
call at the Consulate?”
“I don’t know yet.”
“What do you mean?”
“For two years I have been Consul, and
only one Bolivian called in that time, and
his name was Murphy.”
When the gravity of the Court was re-
stored, the examination proceeded:
“Are you still the Consul?”
“No.”
“What happened?”
“An envious and highly-placed Govern-
ment servant wrote home and accused me
of being a Presbyterian.”
If that was Bolivia’s loss it was Bris-
bane’s gain. Mr. Pares returned to his
fiddle, in due course to accomplish the
extraordinary and formidable feat of
organising, training and actually con-
ducting in public and broadcast perform-
ances an orchestra of one thousand violin-
ists of all ages from childhood to the
eighties. They played an item composed
by Mr, Pares, and it should be enough
to take Mr. Pares’s word for it, without
risking demonstration, that they played
it well.
Meanwhile, there was the Hall of the
Muses; habitat of the musical of most
instruments and most countries. Let one
of them suffice; “The Russian Joan of
Arc” ; a striking figure striding through
Brisbane’s streets in white Cossack boots
and flowery exotic robes. Recording that
“she carried scars claimed by her to be
of battle,” Mr. Pards adds in parenthesis
“probably domestic.” If that seems a
little severe on the Russian Joan, Mr.
Pares has passable ground for it. The
lady was a talented professional singer
of folk songs of many lands, and with
her and a pianiste Mr. Pares toured
southern parts of Queensland. In their
railway compartment on the way to Ips-
wich were “a few nuns and some other
dignified people.” Mr. Pares leaned to-
ward the singer and “in a soft voice
passed some harmless remark about the
scenery”:
To my astonishment, gathering herself
up with a great show of protestation and
in a loud voice for the benefit of all in
the compartment, she roundly denounced
me:
■ “You dirrty low man! You have feelthy
mind! How dare you make vulgar re-
mark like that to me! What you think
I am? Woman of the street! Yes!”
I was feeling dreadful. All eyes were
strained on me. I was speechless. Although •
innocent of her charges I felt I wanted to
jump out of the window. She, kept the
tirade going until I had turned red and
pale alternately a dozen times. Finally she
burst out laughing and said;
“This is good joke, eh? v
Mr. Pares should have recognised who
that lady really was. She has been with
him all through . . . Dame Life. People
lacking the Pares touch of humor end
the “Dame” with an “n.” ,
"Leviathan's Inch."
The best of Brian Elliott’s Leviathan’s
Inch (Angus and Robertson) is its prose;
passages of charming description. There
is also, here and there, evidence of a talent
for prose of a different sort, analytical and
satirical:
Businessmen, red-necked, and their dull
wives stepped down from the old yellow
tram and bought scones and tea to carry
to the wooden benches by the Maid of
Honour, where they escaped the tyranny
of their old thoughts by thinking them over
again against the background of nature’s
grandeur.
And when this sort of acid precision
of style is brought to bear on human
beings there results, in at least one case,
an effective portrait:
His information was mostly of out-of-
the-way subjects, interesting because of their
curiosity; but if the talk shifted to current
topics, politics, affairs, commonplace
actualities, he froze and sat mute. His life
was lived comfortably among bric-a-brac
and objets d’art, pictures, jade and ivory,
a little exotic poetry, coffee and the music
of Debussy McKissock himself was tall,
thin, brown a gypsy-like brown, with
black eyes and abundant coarse, quite
straight black hair beginning uncertainly
to grey His choice of a way of life
conduced to the atrophy of bis emotions,
emotions which, since he could not afford
them, were driven deep and resolutely into
his subconscious. It made a brown, flesh-
less automaton of him.
A sort of perpetual scholar at a uni-
versity, McKissock is an unusual charac-
ter to encounter in an Australian novel.
The “difference” of Leviathan’s Inch, and
its attempt at presenting an intellectual
concept of life, may be counted among
its merits.
One should not, however, overestimate
its “difference,” As a picture of scholas-
tic life it has some resemblance to Sea-
forth Mackenzie’s The Young Desire It;
and in its scenes'of drama on the island
it recalls Leslie Mellor’s Quartet.
In spite of its realistic pictures of the
island, the novel resembles both Mac-
kenzie’s and Mellor’s in a curious “place-
lessness”: the word “Australia” appears
only on the jacket and —legitimately but
disappointingly—the author has selected
so small a group of people for examina-
tion that they seem to have no relation
at all to the ordinary stream of Aus-
tralian life. Surfing, sailing and fishing
bring some touches of Australian atmos-
phere to the island ; but of the univer-
sity one hardly learns more than that
McKissock has a room in it furnished
in Japanese style. Here, and in its
dramas, and in the prose itself the novel
is very much thinner than The Young
Desire It; as, in the island scenes, it is
very much less dramatic than Quartet.
It is a story that never becomes really
interesting, partly because of the meagre-
ness and futility of two of the leading
characters a student named Richard
and a girl named Ruth. It is impossible
to care what happens to a pair so color-
less : whether Ruth will win Richard
from the “poet” Julian Timbrel, whether
she will drop him for a manlier lover,
or whether she will give up love alto-
gether and take to knitting. Richard
drifts so abjectly through the novel that
one can hardly join the novelist in his
optimism when, at the end, the pair
come together.
Richard and Ruth, however, are in-
cidental to the main theme, which is the
salvation of the soul of the “poet.”
Timbrel is writing a long poem about
the seven deadly sins and, having decided
that sloth is the deadliest of them in
modern times, overcomes the disease in
himself by completing his poem, sending
Richard to Ruth, ridding himself of a
perverted youth named Teddy Myers,
murdering (for no clearly-stated reason)
a Rabelaisian university colleague named
Tandy and, finally, jumping into the sea
with the manuscript of his masterpiece.
All of which seems to the present com-
mentator utterly unreal.
One can only take Timbrel seriously—
his sloth, his literary and personal prob-
lems, his act of murder, his suicide and
the loss of his poem—if one can really
believe that he is a great poet who has
written a masterpiece. And on that vital
point Mr. Elliott fails altogether to make
his novel convincing. Timbrel is a deca-
dent, something like the rhymers of the
’nineties who fell under the spell of
Les Fleurs du ,Mal; and so is, at best,
a minor figure. In fact, sipce he is
careful to take his “masterpiece” with
him when he jumps into the sea, it is
psychologically almost certain that, as a
“poet,” he is a complete dud, and knows
is. A degenerate and a dud —Timbrel is
a fit subject for satire; even perhaps for
a squalid type of tragedy; but, treating
him with reverence, Mrs. Elliott places his
novel on a false basis right from the start.
When Balzac touched on a somewhat
similar theme in The Unknown Master-
piece his treatment of it was strikingly
different. Frenhofer, a dilettante artist,
keeps his “masterpiece” hidden as does
Mr. Elliott’s hero and, like Timbrel,
threatens never to show it to the world ;
to burn it before he dies. When he is
lured into showing it to two artist friends.
Frenhofer is revealed as a fraud ; he may
once have had the beginnings of a master-
piece on his canvas, but he has been
daubing at it for ten years, smearing and
smothering it with paint until there is
nothing left:
“Answer me! lam your friend; tell
me, have I spoilt my picture?”
Porbus hesitated, he dared not speak;
but the anxiety depicted on the old man's
white face was so heart-rending that he
pointed to the canvas, saying:
“Look!”
Frenhofer gazed at his picture for a
moment and staggered.
“Nothing! Nothing! And I have worked
ten yeaA!”
He fell upon a chair and wept.
“So lam an idiot, a madman! I have
neither talent nor capability! lam naught
save a rich man who, in walking, does
nothing more than walk! So I shall have
produced nothing! ”
He gazed at his canvas through his tears,
then suddenly rose proudly from his chair
and cast a flashing glance upon the two
painters.
“By the blood, by the body, by the head
of Christ! You are jealous dogs who
seek to make me believe that it is ruined
in order to steal it from me. I see her!”
he cried. “She is marvellously lovely.”
That night Frenhofer burns his picture
and kills himself. And so Balzac’s story
becomes —as Leviathan’s Inch should
have been, if Brian Elliott had looked
more closely at his characters—a study
of the inordinate vanity of the minor
artist, the tragedy of the talented fraud.
A further contrast between the two
tales is in the characters of Timbrel and
his disciples, Frenhofer and his. Timbrel
is like the “poet” in Shaw’s “Candida,”
the “artist” in “The Doctor’s Dilemma,”
a degraded figure, possibly true to life,
but true only in the outer fringes of the
artistic world even today. In all Balzac’s
writing his respect for the artist is
evident ; Porbus and Poussin are con-
vincing as artists because they are con-
vincing as men ; and Frenhofer’s down-
fall is moving because he, too, fraud
though he is, is a man.
Lighter Letters.
Dear Sir, by Juliet Lowell (Peter
Huston), is a slim, yellow-covered book,
compiled from extracts from letters, com-
plete with spelling and grammatical
errors, with enough unconscious humor
in them to raise a smile, and sometimes
a laugh. Drawn from official files in
America, the extracts are symptomatic
of a current American taste —a humor
which, properly speaking, is no humor
at all, or at least only the barest threads
of it. And since any U.S. fashion,
whether in letters, art, music or manners,
is sure of flattering imitation here, it
is reasonably certain that we shall see
a lot more of this type of writing: a
prospect which the present commentator
views with some horror.
To call this a bastard type of humor
is just: but then again its present mani-
festation is merely a harmless little book
with a yellow paper cover. There are
laughs in it, for it is always pleasant
to read other people’s written idiocies.
It is not unlike the pleasant superior
glow one gets watching a neighbor fall
on his face. There is, for instance, the
letter from a social worker, reporting
that she has visited the Kositch family:
“They have religious pictures all over
the place but seem clean however.” Also
the letter from a private tendering his
resignation from the, army—an old gag
but amusingly stated. And the letter
from a harassed citizen, reporting that
“we ain’t got no kids in our house. Just
2 adults and 2 adultresses.” And, as
human documents, the letters of Mrs.
Esthalia B.C. and Mrs. Cassy M., ad-
dressed to the O.P.A. and the Draft
Board respectively, have their points.
Thus Mrs. 8.C.:
Gentlemen,
I am a descendant of one of the Pilgrim
Fathers so why do I have to contend with
ration regulations.
T have lived in London for many years
and when the War started I came to this
Country in order to escape from any in-
convenience.
Please make arrangements at once
whereby I am permanently freed from
having to bother with rationing of any kind.
Advance thanks
And Mrs. M. is candid:
Dear United States Army,
My husband asked me to wwte a recom-
mend* that he supports his family. He
cannot read so don’t tell him. Just take
him. He ain’t no good to me. He ain't
done nothing but raise hell and drink
lemon essence since I married him 8 years
ago. and I got to feed seven kids of his.
Maybe you can get him to carry a gun.
He’s good on squirrels and eating. Take
him and welcome
But if this rings true, the letter of
Fred K., as an example of unconscious
humor, is naturally suspect:
Captain William Lee Tracy
Fort Custer, Michigan
Dear Captain Tracy
My seargent told me that if I studied
nights I might make a first class idiot.
Is this better than a second class heu-
perhaps, that the private
was taking a shot at the sergeant? Vt
at a lieutenant? Or even Captain Wil-
liam Lee Tracy? If so, he should have
been delighted.

A spray that will destroy noogoora burr and
yet is non-injurious to horses ?
Know of no spray that has these properties,
but sodium chlorate or atlacide, both common
weedicides, may be used. Feeding tests have
shown that stock can be poisoned, but these
are not generally regarded as poisons. Atlacide
mixed at the rate of Igal. to 4gals. water or
sodium chlorate mixed at the rate of 11b. to
2gals. water would prove effective if applied
as a fine spray. Care must be taken with these
sprays,' as the sodium chlorate mixture when
dry on any vegetable matter (clothing, leather,
wood/ etc.) becomes highly inflammable and
will ignite either with friction or from a flame.
Atlacide is a proprietary mixture of sodium
chlorate that has had some of the fire risk
eliminated but may, nevertheless, be dangerous.

When did Hornibrook visit England with an
Australian cricket team and what were his
averages ?
P. M. Hornibrook (Q.) went to England in
the 1930 Australian XL His full bowling figures
were 864.2 overs, 249 maidens, 1913 runs,
103 wickets, averaging 18.57. He was third
on the list, those above him being Grimmett
(144 wickets averaging 16.84) and Kippax (five
wickets averaging 18.40). With the bat Horni-
brook scored 241 runs, averaging 12.05.

Who invented playing-cards and when ?
As in the case of all ancient pastimes, the
origin is obscure; the widely-taken view is that
they come from Asia. In the Chinese dictionary
Ching-tsze-tung (1678), it is said that cards
were invented in the reign of Seun-ho, a.d.
1120, for the amusement of his concubines.
Tradition says that cards have existed m India
from time immemorial, and their invention has
been assigned to the Egyptians and the Arabs.
Their introduction into Europe is also a matter
of dispute, but they appear to have been known
in England in the thirteenth century.

hyp fnY rntnrrh ?
The condition may develop .as a result of
recurrent head colds, but irritative factors pre-
cipitate the attack where there is a tendency
to catarrhal lesions. There is no specific
remedy; treatment in all cases aims at cor-
rection of the initial fault. Pending examination
avoid extremes, take frequent aperient salines,
and spray nose and throat daily with the fol-
lowing: Menthol, 3 grains; camphor, 2 grains;
chloretone, 1 grain; oil of cinnamon, 5 drops;
liquid paraffin oil to loz. Occasional irrigation
of the nasal passages with a saline wash is also
beneficial.

How to propagate hydrangeas from prunings ?
Place cuttings of last year’s flowering stems
in boxes of sandy loam to strike. They should
not be shifted for at least six months. If the
cuttings are to be set in the open garden, mix
plenty of sand into the soil. The cuttings are
more likely to strike when placed at a slightly
tilted angle. April is a good time to do the
work.

What was the “dump” in early Australian
coinage and how did the term originate?
In order to prevent the re-export of Spanish
dollars (the usual currency of the colony),
which, owing to their continually-rising value,
were in much demand throughout the world,
Governor Macquarie in 1813 issued a pro-
clamation directing that “a small circular
piece of silver shall be struck out of the centre
of each such dollar, which, together with the
remaining such dollar, is intended to be issued
and circulated at the value and under the regu-
lations hereinafter described.” The piece cut

What soil should be used for a window-box
garden ?
Take several spadefuls of sweet loam, and
to this add two or three handfuls of crushed
charcoal, a tablespoonful of bonedust, and a
spadeful of well-decayed manure, mixing all
together thoroughly. If the loam used is on
the heavy side, add some sand to keep it open,
while, if well-decayed manure cannot be
obtained, some leaf-mould may be substituted.
Brief Answers.
C.G.: The Medlow Bath (N.S.W.) hydro was
opened on July 4, 1904. It was run as a hydro-
pathic establishment for two or three years.

value, and, in fact, is poisonous to stock, like
its relative, Duboisia myoporoides, the cork
tree... .A.J.D.; The cracks should be chipped
out to a width of about -Jin., cleaned and
wetted. Mix Portland cement and sand with
wafer so that mixture will remain set in the
hand when squeezed; ram into cracks, smooth
off surface and cover with bags, kept wet for
at least 14 days C.H.A.; Strictly speaking
the “Union Jack” is only a “jack” when flown
from the jack-staff of a ship of war; the correct

hanged on November 11, 1880, at Melbourne.
M.J.S.: A person over the age of 2.1 can-
not be legally adopted... .E.R.: To blue gun-
barrels dissolve two parts crystal iron chloride,
two parts antimony chloride and one part gallic
acid in four or five parts distilled water. Apply

Repeat process two or three times, then wash
with water and dry. Rub with boiled linseed
oil to deepen the shade.. . .C.K.: Pope Joan
was a mythical Englishwoman alleged to have
been Pope for two years, 853-855. The legend

The lines are not by Sappho, but occur in
Pope’s translation of Ovid’s Heroic Epistle
XV, called “Sappho to Phaon” A.M.: An
effective embrocation for the purpose is to add
to equal parts camphorated oil and methylated
spirit 10 per cent, eucalyptus oil or methyl

Verse is a generic terra descriptive of the liter-
ary form of balanced lines to a rhythm, rhymed

in the verse-form which is inspired by the
creative poetic gift. Keats’s “Ode to a Nightin-
gale” is poetry, and the Ingoldsby Legends
are verse V.L.: A fortified wine, such as
port, Madeira, Frontignac or sherry, will retain

ing the bottle C.A.: Aluminium may be
used safely for all cooking. As in the case
of all other metals, the utensils must be kept
scrupulously clean by light scouring and no
food should be allowed to stand overlong in
them, as the metal is easily ruined by acids.
Soda should never be used on aluminium, as
it causes pitting S.L.L.; Figaro is a famous
character of dramatic fiction, who made his
first appearance in the “Barbier de Seville’
(1785) and the “Manage de Figaro” of Beau-

and Italian meant wigmaker. Beaumarchais’s
Figaro figures in Mozart’s “Marriage of Figaro,’
Rossini’s “Barber of Seville” and 15 less suc-
cessful operas on the same theme E.M.D.:
Waratah seeds can be sown from September
to November, in the garden or in seed pans
or boxes. It is advisable to have the boxes
perforated and covered with a layer of drain-
age material, such as crocks, cinders and
charcoal. The soil should be kept damp, but
not too wet.

A RHYME OF SPARROWS.
From early morn till
The shades of night
They descend for food
And take to flight.
They twitter and frolic
And dart here and there,
Skim over houses—
And high in the air.
Around the suburbs
And in gardens green
The shifty sparrows
In clusters are seen.
Tira, teera, tooralay,
Every dog must have his day.
Time afore I waxed most mad
With the sting of love denied,
I was sad who now am glad.
Melancholy, shook and sighed,
Enamored with fair Emily’s eyes,
Lustrous locks and radiant guise
But that was another day.
Then, she lingered with a Yank
Gay and gallant, free of hand.
I was poor, but the hussy drank
Till the gay blade sailed to his motherland.
Now, whenever I am paid,
I am pestered by this maid:
And that’s the reason why I say.
Every dog must have his day.

THE HIND OF BEEF
No. Bof "The C ookabundy
Chronicles.”
BY
BRIAN
CTAMES
MR. HOLT was undoubtedly very
“well in.” He used his many pad-
docks for fattening, and there was
no keener dealer in cattle any-
where.
Hard, thin, tough old man was Mr.
Holt, with a neck wonderfully wrinkled,
and more wrinkles still about his very
blue straight-gazing eyes. Clean-shaven,
except for side-whiskers, known as
mutton-chops ; but how he got the hair
from his throat with all the wrinkles was
a mystery. Except when he went to
church, and then he
was dressed in severe
black and carried an
enormous Bible with
a long black leather
marker dangling out
of it, he was plainly
and simply clad:
never a coat, and
bluey-grey checkered
shirt and nondescript
trousers. The shirt-
sleeves were always
rolled up, exposing
thin arms, freckled
and brown.
A stockwhip, coiled
up, was' always over his arm. He rode
a fine bay horse, well-trained but still
spirited.
Mr. Holt had a number of sons, and all
of them, except the youngest, had scat-
tered and settled down. They were doing
well. The youngest—Ray—though he
scattered himself a good deal over the
district, had not settled down.
Mrs. Holt said, bluntfey, that Ray was
dragging the family’s name through the
mud. It was Mr. Holt who acted as pro-
tector ; he was determined to “give the
boy a chance.”
No one twitted Mr. Holt about Ray.
Somehow he seemed to carry a cXxrled-up
stockwhip in his eye, as well as over his
arm.
Yet, if the complaints about Ray were
respectful, they were also plentiful. It
might be Kelly, of the Contingent
“Good day, Mr. Holt! Now, isn’t it
the great weather we’re having, if it would
only rain an inch or two, with a soft
shower or two maybe to follow it up?”
“Well, what’s the trouble, Kelly?”
“I hate to be mentioning it at all, Mr.
Holt.”
“What’s he been doing now?”
“It’s the slate, Mr. Holt. I’d like to
be cleaning it, though I hate worrying
you ; but I can’t afford”
“How much is it, Kelly?”
“It’s a lot —I hate to be telling of it.”
The amount, twenty pounds, thirty
pounds—whatever it was —would be paid.
And Kelly would be admonished for
“encouraging the lad.” Kelly would say,
“It’s hard to be refusing him anything.
And if it wasn’t with me, Mr. Holt, it
would be somewhere else, and a lot worse
at that.”
Or it might be Hogan, of the Royal,
where another slate was in urgent need of
cleaning —and Mr. Holt would clean it.
Or it might even be old Sergeant Sim,
who knew everything and said next to
nothing about it. “Holt, it’s just a
friendly word like —but you might do
something to prevent the trouble”
And Mr. Holt did it, whatever it was.
After any really big trouble, Mr. Holt
and Ray would go out to the Holt pro-
perties at Round Swamp or Sandy Ridges,
where there were houses of sorts, and
spend a week or two “fixing things”
that needed doing. Or they might go out
north-west somewhere, and be away for
weeks and weeks “looking at cattle,” or
“buying some steers.” And eventually
come back to town —and fresh trouble.
This Ray had many of the graces.
Taller than the old man, very strong,
brown hair, and eyes chat had a laughing
devil in them. He would ride any horse
you liked to dare him to, and fight any-
one who wanted to. His boon companion
was Jack Ryan, who must share with
Mr. Holt the credit of helping Ray out
of trouble; though it must be admitted
that the trouble that Jack got him out of
was often the trouble that Jack had got
him into.
ONE day Ray and Jack drove up to
Billy Rosen’s. Billy heard them
splashing through the creek at the cross-
ing, and making noisy and hilarious
ascent of the steep hill between creek
and house.
For a number of reasons—and good
ones —Billy was not pleased with the
way of approach: when Ray rode to the
place he carried off only what wine he
drank (which was no small quantity), but
when he drove he took that, plus a lot
more for further libation.
Billy disappeared from view, in the
feeble hope that his absence would make
Ray go off again without further trouble.
The sulky was an absurd arrangement
with shafts, home-made of stringy-bark
and nearly a mile long, with a fiery young
colt towards the front end of them. It
pulled up near the shed over the cellar.
“Billy Ros-en!” Ray rendered it like
a line from an anthem. There was also
a rich note of welcome in it for him-
self. No response.
“Billy Ros-en! Billy Ros-en.” More
loud and clear. There were only echoes.
Adolf Himmelman’s shaggy head ap-
peared around a corner. But Adolf
proved a hostile witness. As far as he
knew—or cared—Billy was far away.
“We’ll help ourselves then,” Ray an-
nounced with great conviction.
That brought Billy, at a jog-trot, out
of hiding. -
“ ’Ullo, Ray! ’Ullo, Jack! Nice day ;
want rain; grass -scarce; what do you
want? What do you want?”
“Billy, any man who says we want
rain is a liar. We want wine.”
“Can’t have it. Can’t have- it! Had
too much already.”
“Good boy, Billy! Tha»t’s right. Just
fetch us a bottle now, and we’ll take a
case with us.”
Billy went into figures, and calculations,
and sorrow. “Ray, you owe me a lot
of money.” Billy’s lips moved as in silent
prayer'. “You owe me just two hundred
pounds.”
Ray laughed merrily. “Billy, Billy!
Two hundred pounds! Two hundred
pounds would buy the whole place, wine
and all, with old Adolf thrown in.”
Billy thought the place was worth a
bit more, and said so.
“Hurry up, Billy, fetch out the case!”
“Give you one bottle —no more. Can’t
afford to make wine for people who
won’t pay for it.”
“A drop like that goes nowhere, Billy.
We want a case.”
“Can’t have it —only a bottle.”
“Whose steers are those down by the
creek, Billy?”
“They’re mine.”
“Quite a nice lot, Billy.”
“I paid for them—good money for
them.”
“You’ve nothing to feed them on,
Billy.”
“Dry, dry ; want rain! ”
“Tell you what, Billy! There’s stacks
of grass in our Grey Box paddock. No-
thing to eat it, and it is just going to
waste. Run them in there, Billy, and”
Billy’s eye lit up. Good fellow as he
was, there was a certain cupidity in Billy.
Ray noted the change
—also that Billy was work-
ing out costs.
“Won’t cost you a cent,
Billy. Not a cent. The
grass is only going to
waste, Billy. Just run ’em
in and let ’em stay; till
they’re fat. They’ll be as
fat as mud in no time.”
“Come and have a
drink, Ray! Come and
have a drink, Jack!” And
a delighted Billy led two
brothers to the cellar.
Nay, more than brothers,
for brothers are often not
so generous in spirit.
At last Ray and Jack departed—with
two cases of wine on the floor of the
sulky.
THE steers were moved without delay
to Holt’s paddock, and they found it
hard to believe that such grass could
grow anywhere—apart from dreams.
At short—very short —intervals for
weeks after, Ray and Jack drove up to
Billy’s for a case of wine. It would have
taken a lot of bullocks with impossible
appetites to eat the equivalent of all that
wine.
And so Billy reasoned it out. The
cases came more and more reluctantly
out of the cellar. “Look, look, look,
Ray! It would be a lot cheaper to pay
‘adjustment’ for those steers!”
“Billy, I wouldn’t hear of agistment.
I said you could have the grass for noth-
ing, and I meant it. And we want two
cases today, Billy.”
Billy’s heart was heavy. But he brought
the cases up, saying as he put each into
the sulky, “Adjustment a lot cheaper!”
Ray considered that the steers had, as
he put it, been “worked out.” It was
time to try Billy’s brother Fred. Fred
Rosen had a big vineyard further up the
Willow Bends.
Fred was mending the front fence near
the house when the sulky arrived. He
greeted the pair in it with no noticeable
enthusiasm. He was less enthusiastic
still about “a case of wine, now.”
“You owe me just on fifty pounds,
Ray.”
“That’s all right, Fred. That’s all
right, though it can’t be quite fifty.”
“Yes, it is. And I have a big family to
keep and feed.”
That was true enough. There were
children running about everywhere, and
heads of children could be seen peeping
from many coigns of vantage.
“You haven’t killed lately, Fred?”
Fred Rosen did a bit of butchering as
a sideline. His own family ate a lot of
meat and he sold the rest.
“Hard to get anything fat enough just
now,” said Fred gloomily.
“There are plenty of steers in our Grey
Box paddock,” said Ray. “Plenty. And
fat as butter.”
Fred was interested. “How much are
you asking?” '*
Ray seemed to cogitate deeply. “Look,
Fred! You’ve been a jolly decent sort
to me, and I’ve been thinking I’d like to
make you a present. You have a birth-
day soon, don’t you?”
Fred very honestly declared that there
was no birthday for five months.
“Oh, that’s close enough, Fred. You
take one of those steers from my pad-
dock. They’re all good, but you take the
best one you can find. Take your pick.
It’s yours.”
Very soon Fred Rosen had his two
honored guests seated in the cellar and
some special stuff before them.
“I say, Fred, when you kill that steer
give Billy a hind. He’s been very decent
to me, too.”
Fred became confidential. “Ray, Billy
and I are not speaking. At the moment
we are hating each other like poison.”
This sad disagreement between the
Rosen brothers distressed Ray greatly.
“That’s bad, Fred. Very, very bad. I
didn’t know. Great pity that such fine
people should fall out.”
Ray was full of sympathy, and Jack
thought that the, present of a hind might
go a long way towards making the
brothers friends again.
“I can’t go near Billy—he started it,
and he’ll have to speak first.”
“But you could get young Victor to
take it over, Fred.” Victor was the
oldest hopeful of Fred’s family.
Fred thought that might be managed.
He was in expansive mood. “You said
you wanted two cases of wine, didn’t you,
Ray?”
“That’s right, Fred. Two cases each.”
Ray thought it wise to use any generosity
when he found it lying about.
The departure of the guests (and bene-
factors) was a beautiful and touching
sight, and Fred’s gratitude was glistening
in his eyes. He was sorry there wasn’t
room in the sulky for more cases.
“Don’t forget,” Ray reminded him, “to
take the best beast you can find.”
Fred murmured something.
“I’d like to give you a hand with it—
but I’m off to Sandy Ridges today.”
Jack and Ray drove off.
AND that very day Fred brought in a
very nice and very fat steer.
Billy was mystified at the arrival of the
precious hind.
“Father said to give it to you,” Victor
said. “You are not to pay for it, he
said.”
Billy looked at the beef. It was prime,
and Victor volunteered the information
that it was one of Holt’s steers. Billy
was interested.
“Ray Holt gave
it to Father, you
know. For his
birthday. Father
and I went up
and brought it
down ourselves.”
“Where from?”
“From the
Grey Box pad-
dock. Ray had a
little mob o f
them running
round. Beautifully
fat, and he gave
us our pick.”
Billy gave a howl —long drawn and
pathetic. Then he went into immediate
action. He and Adolf Himmelman fairly
sailed over to Fred’s in the wagonette
and commandeered the rest of the steer.
The conversation between the brothers
on this most distressing occasion is im-
possible of record. Both spoke at once,
and Mrs. Fred came out and joined in
shrilly. Thieves, liars and crooks were
perhaps distinguishable terms, but it is
difficult to say if these were to indicate
mutual admiration or to describe Ray and
Jack.
But Billy Rosen and Adolf drove off
with the rest of the carcass, minus a few
choice cuts that Fred had already sent
down to the wife’s father. In all, it can’t
be said that the steer or the incident did
anything, to re-establish brotherly rela-
tions. The period of hating like poison
was much prolonged.
Fred and Billy both went in to see
Dawson, the solicitor. Dawson saw
them singly and then together. He found
it difficult to make himself heard. But
at last he gave them to understand that
the best plan was to see Holt, senior, and
see what he would do about it.
“That doesn't apply to me—every stitch Tm wearing is pre-war."

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
TOWARDS CIVIL WAR IN CHINA.
The action of the Chinese Communist
party leaders in boycotting the meeting
of The National Assembly in Nanking
would seem to have ended all hopes of
any early settlement of differences in
China and may well be the starting
point for a full-scale civil war. London
“Times” explained that the meeting “was
summoned by Chiang Kai-shek’s Govern-
ment after the Generalissimo had ordered
a cease-fire in the operational areas to
conciliate the Communists.” After the
Communist delegates left Nanking Chiang
Kai-shek ordered his military leaders
attending the National Assembly meet-
ing to return to the front.
Civil war in China is no new thing.
Tillman Durdin, writing in the N. Y.
“Times,” says that the scale of the fight-
ing between the Communist and National
Government forces is no greater now
than it has been on several other occa-
sions since the surrender of Japan, “but
the for a rapid expansion and
intensification of hostilities have never
been more ominous. The country plainly
is on the verge of a showdown civil war
of large proportions.” Durdin points out
that “ever since the overthrow of the
Manchu dynasty 35 years ago, Chinese
factions have been engaged in inter-
mittent c\vil war. For 18 of these years
armies of the Kuomintang, or Govern-
ment party, have been fighting troops of
the Communist party. The situation is a
tragic frustrating conundrum.
“For China herself peace is a desperate
requirement if she is to recover from
the Japanese invasion and the effects of
internecine strife. Internationally the
need for a strong pacific China also is
urgent. The Far East requires the poli-
tical and economic leadership of a stable,
progressive Chinese nation. A weak, dis-
organised China operates like a mael-
strom, drawing Russia and the U.S. into
rival manoeuvres that constitute a grave
danger to world security. A China able
to take care of herself would be a bul-
wark and bridge between America and
the Soviet.”
Communists and Kuomintang
As Durdin says, “the professed pro-
grammes of both Chinese parties are in
agreement on nearly all major questions.
Both claim to want democratic, constitu-
tional Government; both advocate
agrarian reforms ; both favor State opera-
tion of heavy industries, communications,
utilities, mining ; both protest their regard
for democratic liberties ; both assert their
desire to be friends with both the ,U.S.
and Russia; both say they want to de-
mobilise and get on with the tasks of
post-war rehabilitation.”
He finds “the main explanation why
strife persists in China” in the nature of
the two groups : “The Kuomintang and
the Communists are rival armed parties
engaged in a struggle for power. They
represent social forces, but the hate, sus-
picion and bitterness engendered by
years of civil war are in themselves suffi-
cient at this stage to keep them at each
other’s throats. Each represents to the
other a threat to its group existence.
Each is capable of ruthless action. Each
identifies the national welfare with the
welfare of its group. The Government
party feels any peace with the Com-
munists that leaves the Yenan faction
with freedom of action and an appreci-
able armed strength would be utilised to
gain an advantage along the road to
ultimate control of all China, The Com-
munists fear that the Kuomintang intends
to reduce them to impotency if not to
exterminate them.
“The social and political forces repre-
sented by the two factions contribute to
the sharp division between them. The
Kuomintang is building up an economic
system consisting of a complex intermesh-
ing of Government and private enterprise
similar to the Zaibatsu economy of Japan.
Government officials participate in private
business, and most major undertakings are
closely linked with officialdom. Labor
unions are led by party-designated
officials. Chambers of Commerce, guilds,
even sporting organisations, are part of
the party machine. The Communists also
maintain a closely controlled system in
their areas. Education is a process of
political indoctrination; major enter-
prises are Government-managed or super-
vised ; there is no opposition press, and
key Communists maintain a careful
domination of most popular activity.
“The mutually exclusive character of
the two parties and their Governments is
a formidable barrier to national unity and
inter-party settlement or coalition.
“The most valuable coal and iron de-
posits in the country and some of the
main food-producing areas are in Com-
munist hands. This fact generates a
strong compulsion for the Government
to conquer these critical districts and re-
open communications so that the re-
sources of the country can be utilised to
bolster the Government’s faltering eco-
nomic position. Given the inherent poli-
tical irreconcilability, the economic
factors in present circumstances help to
•perpetuate hostilities in a warfare that
now becomes a struggle for resources.
“Although world peace requires a
stable China, Russo-American differences
have diminished the effectiveness of in-
ternational pressure for Chinese unity.
The Communists are regarded by the
Kuomintang as puppets of Soviet worlcj
policy, while the Communists charge the
Kuomintang with serving the interests of
the U.S. Elimination of American aid in
the form of lend-lease, credits and surplus
Pacific war properties probably would
harm the Chinese people as a whole,
more than its continuation helps the
Kuomintang fight the civil war, but it
is doubtless a factor in bolstering the
Government in its uncompromising
policy toward the Communists.”
Durdin declares that “the military and
political strife is having a disastrous
effect on the economic and social life of
China. Disruption of communications
has reduced her life blood to a thin,
sluggish flow. Her people hunger and
die in one province because food from
the outside cannot be brought in. In
Manchuria, the one really major sur-
plus-food area of China, starvation exists
in many pockets because the Communists
have destroyed the railways and warring
armies block the transport routes. Some
of the biggest coalmines of China are
within 200 miles of Shanghai and Nan-
king, yet these cities and most of the
Yangtse valley must be supplied with coal
from the Kailan mines of north-east
Hopei, 700 miles away by ship,”
He believes that “China’s only hope
of choking off the wild inflation now
afflicting the country and of establishing
a stable currency lies in demobilising
the huge military machines maintained
by the Government and the Communists.
Revenue covers only a fraction of the
Central Government’s expenditures, and
most of the costs are met by printing new
notes. Yet the Government is allocating
70 per cent, of all disbursements to its
armed forces. China today is a land of
mass suffering; of dilapidated cities; of
ports, roads and railways, in disrepair
after the war, operating at a low level
of efficiency; of hundreds of thousands
of refugees still barred from their homes
by one fighting faction or another.”
The “Third Parties”
The Shanghai correspondent of the
London “Times” does find some hope in
the Chinese political scene. He remarks
on the existence, little recognised outside
China, of other parties besides those of
Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists.
In the ideals of the so-called “Third
Parties” he sees a possible solution for
China’s future.
“Amidst the clash of arms in China the
voice of moderation has so far been un-
able to make itself heard,” he says, “but
there exists a body of Chinese opinion
which holds moderate liberal views, and,
though at present small in number, never-
theless exerts a real influence on public
thought. This group forms the so-called
‘Third Parties,’ of which there are some
half-dozen or more, mostly with high-
sounding titles, but with only small fol-
lowings. Among them the Democratic
League is the best-organised and largest,
claiming a membership of 400,000.
“Compromise and a sense of modera-
tion are marked characteristics of the
Chinese, Traditionally they dislike ex-
tremes and seek the middle way.” There-
fore the “Times” man thinks it “sur-
prising that American efforts at media-
tion do not seem to have taken into
account these representatives of moderate
opinion, the parties of the middle.”
The programme of the “Third Parties,”
he says, may be outlined as follows:
Immediate truce to be agreed to by both
sides. A National Assembly to be con-
voked whose members are to be selected
by the parties in equitable proportion, so
that no single party shall have a majority
over all the others. The Assembly to draw
up a new Constitution. A Coalition Gov-
ernment to be formed with a middle-party
leader or Kuomintang left-winger as Prime
Minister and with Chiang Kai-shek as
President. The first task of this Govern-
ment would then be to amalgamate the
armies into a single national force and re-
incorporate the areas now under Com-
munist control. It is claimed that such a
coalition, based on a fixed Constitution,
would have the necessary moral influence
and popular support to enforce its de-
cisions on the extremists. A Government
which would no longer be a one-party
affair could reasonably expect the support
of the Western democratic Powers.
So much for the programme, “It is when
it comes to putting theory into practice
that the real difficulties start. The Kuo-
mintang and the Communists distrust
each other to such a degree that, unless
some third party could guarantee the ful-
filment of any agreement between them,
neither would be prepared to relinquish
its present power. This function of
guarantor the Democratic League, with
little political influence and no armed
force to back it, is totally unable to per-
form. The existence of these middle
parties does little more than point the
moral for a rather remote future.
“The trouble in China is fundamental,
and is one of the main causes of the
weakness of the ‘Third Parties,’ In dis-
cussing the present situation foreigners
are apt to treat it as if there existed in
China a long-standing liberal and demo-
cratic tradition, which happens merely
to have been forgotten or mislaid in the
present time. Nothing could be further
from the truth. Until within the last few
years political tradition in China has been
authoritarian, with its roots in the teach-
ings of Confucius. The kind of authori-
tarian doctrine favored by Confucius can
be seen from such sayings as ‘The people
may be made to comply, but cannot be
made to understand,’ and ‘Those not in
office should not meddle with govern-
ment.’ The revolutionary, single-party,
dictatorial systems of the Kuomintang
and the Communists are quite in line with
political tradition. That is why many
people ask themselves whether a coalition
based on democratic principles would be
able to settle the dispute between the two
authoritarian groups now contending for
power.”
The “Times” writer concludes neverthe-
less that “one must not be too critical of
this new growth of a Chinese moderate
party, since it would still seem to repre-
sent the one last hope, however slender,
in the ever-growing scene of confusion.
What is the alternative? On the one
hand a clearcut solution by force of arms
is improbable. Spokesmen of the Kuo-
mintang have admitted that even in the
most favorable military circumstances
they cannot wipe out the Communists/
completely. On the other hand, all in-
dications show that the days of Kuomin-
tang rule are coming to an end. For
a variety of reasons the people have
turned down their thumbs against it.
Sooner or later it must be transformed
or disappear from the scene. Yet the
tenets of Communism are alien to the
Chinese character and would be unaccept-
able to a large part of the population.”
If War Comes
If the two factions should “settle
down to a fight to a finish” Durdin
is of the opinion that “a protracted
war of attrition” is unavoidable.
He has made a survey of the relative
strength of both parties, and finds that
“for such a war the Government has by
far the more powerful military machine
in the orthodox sense:
“Despite considerable demobilisation,
the Nationalists have 2,000,000 or more
men under arms, and at least 100 divisions
—of varying strengths—are of fair to
first-rate quality. At least 50 divisions
are equipped with a pretty full allotment
of American weapons, including 39 out-
fitted by the U.S. as part of the pro-
gramme initiated before the end of the
Japanese war. The Government has an
air force of Mustang and Thunderbolt
fighters, Mitchell medium bombers and a
few Liberators heavy enough for tran-
sports. It could put several hundred com-
bat aircraft into action at one time in a
pinch. It has enough of a navy now
to do a useful job of patrolling the
Yangtse River against possible Com-
munist crossings, scouting the coasts and
helping to haul troops.
“The Communists claim about
1,200,000 regular troops and another
2,000,000 men in loosely-administered de-
tachments ranging in size from a few
What Salazar Said'.
An Australian Associated Press report
as published in dailies: —■
Dr. Salazar, in his first public
reference .to the Soviet, eulogised
Russia’s achievements in war and
peace. He ridiculed democracy,
describing it as “a hopeless, in-
definable system.”
“Russia today has the means and
possibilities of entirely dominating
Europe, and may do so without the
majority of Europe being in a posi-
tion to fight,” he said. “How can
other European States emerge from
ruin and anarchy if they have no
doctrine, no force, and practically
no government?”
• It was headed variously “Salazar
Ridicules Democracy” (“S. M. Herald”)
and “Portugese Premier Lauds Soviet”
(Adelaide “Advertiser”).
London “Times,” taking its report
from its own correspondent and from
Reuters, gave the speech a somewhat'
different interpretation. The “Times"
regarded it as a review of European and
world conditions,
“Dr. Salazar said: ‘When a country
finds, as has Portugal, a convenient line
of political thought and action based on
sure experience, it is silly to change it
by paying attention to voices rising from
the ruins of Europe, proclaiming systems
of salvation.’
“Russia today had possibilities of
dominating Europe entirely, and could
do so without the greater part of Europe
being able even to fight. He added:
7 think we should consider the U.S. and
Britain as friendly peoples. I do not
know whether the same may be said
about Russia.’
"Two great States had risen to world
leadership—the United States and Russia.
The United States felt today what they
did not feel in 1919 —the responsibility
of their power and victory. ‘England,
which was able to save herself bravely,
sees her relative position changed, so
that, although acting independently in
defence of her own interests, she has
been approaching more and more the
dualistic conception of the Anglo-Saxon
world.’ ”

hundred to many thousands. They are
trained and constituted for mobile
guerrilla warfare and equipped accord-
ingly. In Manchuria, Chahar and Suiyuan
they took over some Japanese artillery
and a few other heavy weapons, includ-
ing tanks. They may have a few cap-
tured Japanese planes.
“For its best divisions the Government
has at least a six-months reserve of arms
and ammunition, and, with access to the
outside world, is in a position to replenish
supplies and could probably keep its
troops equipped indefinitely. The Com-
munists probably have no big reserves,
and no source for obtaining supplies out-
side of China unless Russia made them
available. They have always said that they
would be able to carry on with the am-
munition and guns they can manufacture
in their own small arsenals and with
equipment captured in combat.”
Durdin reaches the conclusion that!
“the purely military odds weigh rather
heavily in favor of the Kuomintang, but
the Communists have a number of
advantageous factors on their side. They
control some of the richest coalmines in
China, and could force the Government
to enormous expense to bring in adequate
stocks. They also enjoy advantages of
position. They sit astride the main north-
south railways, surround Nationalist
pockets in Peiping, Tientsin, Taiyuan,
Tatung, Tsinan and Tsingtao and menace
the dangerously extended Nationalist
communications in Manchuria.
“The economic sphere of the Com-
munist areas has a simple agrarian
system with an almost limitless resilience,
whereas the Kuomintang is attempting to
maintain a complex modern economy.
Already in a critical condition, the
economic position of the National Gov-
ernment, with the welfare of great cities
like Shanghai involved, would face col-
lapse from the added strains of further
warfare.
“In an all-out civil war the Government
armies would probably be able to advance
up the main communications lines and
clear the Communists out of critical areas,
but the Communists would pull back into
the plains, mountains and villages and
count on unceasing harassment to wear
the Nationalists down.
“On the civilian front probably both
sides would face difficulties of morale.
There are certainly millions in the Com-
munist areas who are not sold on the
Communist system and who are opposed
to civil war.”
Unhappy Rumania.
There have been “elections” in
Rumania. They resulted, as it was ex-
pected they would result, in a sweeping
victory for the Communist group of
parties which constituted the previous
Government, though the London “Times”
correspondent in the country had a short
time before declared, in common with
other , observers, that “no visitor to
Rumania can long remain in doubt of
the overwhelming support for the opposi-
tion.” Both Britain and the U.S. had
criticised the arrangements for the “elec-
tions” before they took place, and there
were complaints afterwards that opposi-
tion party symbols were painted out on
the ballot papers and that “many of the
ballot boxes were full before voting
started.”
Reuben H. Markham, correspondent
for the “Christian Science Monitor,” who
has spent most of his life since 1912 in
south-eastern Europe, gave a brief picture
of Rumania in ‘‘Collier’s.” The
Rumanians, he said, “are milder than
Bulgarians and do less killing. They show
more national unity, love their nation
more, fear Russia more and have fewer
native Communists. Of four Communists
exercising dictatorship over Rumania
only one is of Rumanian origin.
“In Rumania, I studied application of
the Moscow Accord, under which Premier
Groza had , promised to establish civil
liberties, hold free elections, provide a
free press, freedom of meetings, a fair
radio and just treatment of the opposi-
tion. All those promises were flagrantly
broken.
“I believe Russia and the Communist
agents in south-east Europe are attempt-
ing to destroy national resistance in that
part of the world and to bring the nations
under Soviet domination. To accomplish
this they are trying to enable the regime
they have set up to gain control over the
army, courts, police, labor organisations
and peasantry as well as to weaken or
eliminate the larger landowners.
“In Rumania the regime is presented as
a ‘broad democratic coalition.’ In form
it is a coalition ; in reality it is an instru-
ment for Communist domination. The
Cabinet was created under the direct
supervision of Andrei Vishinsky, who
flew from Moscow and who told young
King .Mihai just whom to appoint. The
Prime Minister, Doctor Petru Groza, is
a figurehead. He was the leader of a
small peasant party, known as the Plow-
man’s Front, which was never strong
enough to send a single representative to
Parliament or even to elect anyone to a
county office. He is well-meaning, elegant-
appearing and under the strictest control
of the Secretary-General of his Ministry,
Emil Bodnaras, a powerful and very able
Communist, who has spent much time in
Russia. Rumania is actually run by the
—Birmingham “Gazette.”
“WELL, SHALL WE PROCEED?”
Russian ambassador in Bucharest, the
Russian general heading the Allied
Control Commission and four local Com-
munists, three of whom came from
Russia after Rumania turned against
Hitler and joined the Allies.”
The London “Times” correspondent
had formed almost exactly the same im-
pression. He described the Government
as “entirely controlled by the Communist
party,” and declared that the country is
“passing through a sort of ‘revolution
from above.’ ”
“Though they hold powerful means of
control, the Communists do not feel
secure. Convinced and loyal members of
the party probably do not exceed a few
hundreds. The remainder are attracted
by material inducements and by threats.
Civil servants faced with unemployment
join the party under pressure. Former
Iron-Guardists join partly because they
like extremism and violence, and partly
because if they do not they can be accused
as ‘war criminals.’ Members of national
minorities join because they hope thus
to obtain Government protection. Men-
tion should be made of the Jews, some
of whom see an opportunity for revenge
for the persecution of past years. But
it cannot be easy for the Communist
leaders to run a team of Jews and aiiti-
Semite toughs.”
As the “Times” man saw it, “free elec-
tions” were extremely unlikely. “When
the opposition parties attempt to hold a
meeting in a town they are attacked
by armed bands of Communists
brought up in lorries. In villages
opposition meetings cannot be pre-
vented, as the peasants are solidly be-
hind the opposition, and the Communists
cannot find men to serve them. But party
speakers who go from town to village are
waylaid on their return and beaten. In
all cases the police refuse action against
the aggressors. The closest historical
parallel is the first two years of the Fascist
regime in Italy. There, too, other parties
were officially allowed to exist, but their
followers were beaten or murdered by
Fascist toughs while the police looked
on.
“The Government is hated, for the
general economic misery, for the burden
of the Russian army of occupation, and
for the corruption and brutality of the
administration, which have increased
even in'comparison with earlier dictator-
ships,
“This is, perhaps, the most tragic
moment of Rumania’s tragic history.
Never did a country so much need radical
social reform. Yet the extortions of the
Red Army, who remembered the devas-
tated villages and cities of Ukraine, and
the misdeeds of the Communists, who re-
membered how past Rumanian rulers had
maltreated them, have largely discredited
the ideas of the Left. Today most
Rumanians are aware of only one issue—
whether their nation will survive. For
their part, the Russians, feeling the fierce
flame of Rumanian nationalism, foresee a
revival of Fascism, supported by ‘foreign
imperialist intervention/ They cannot
forget that Rumania is the backdoor to
the invasion of their own country, and
therefore fear to give it up. Yet the
longer they stay, or maintain by force
their servile nominees, the greater is the
hatred and unrest. There seems no way
out.”

Russia is playing a waiting game in China.
Moscow makes no secret of her sympathy with
the Communists. War supplies taken from
the Japanese by the Russians have aided in
arming the Chinese Red Army. Moscow press
and radio have assailed American actions in
China as one-sided intervention on behalf of
the Nationalists. Pending a clearcut military
decision the Russians are sitting on the side-
lines, providing moral support and political
and military advice, but not actively partici-
pating. Russia’s hopes are pinned on these
possibilities: (1) a Communist victory; (2) that
repercussions of Nationalist victories will drive
China’s Communists into the Soviet’s waiting
arms, or (3) a final break between the
Nationalists and Communists that’ will result
in establishment of a Communist State.
China’s Communist leaders have threatened
to set up an independent Sfate adjoining the
Siberian border. Such a State would inevitably
drift info the Russian sphere, following the
pattern set by the Soviet-sponsored Mongolian
People’s Republic, formerly Outer Mongolia.
While the U.S. makes one more attempt to
achieve peace between the Kuomintang and
the Communists and to assist in welding a strong
central democratic government, Russia is to
sit tight and await developments. If General
Marshall’s efforts are successful Russia stands
to exercise, indirectly, a strong influence on a
coalition Government. If there is a final failure,
Russia stands to benefit from the chaos into
■which China will fall. — ‘World Report.”

A special feature of the Rumanian Army is
two political units formed of former prisoners-
of-war “re-educated” in Soviet camps. They
are known as “divisions,” .but their numbers
possibly exceed those of a division, as they
have provided large numbers of recruits to the
purged gendarmerie and police and to the
political commissar department of the army.
Yet they still exist as separate formations within
the army; The political commissars are officially
known as the department of “Education,
Culture, and Propaganda.”— London “Times.”

Egyptian wealth is in relatively few hands.
Feudalistic concepts and practices dominate the
country, its Government and economy. With
British influence withdrawn, the system would
look like a pushover for a Russian-inspired
revolution. Alexandria was considered the
Russian base for intrigue and propaganda dur-
ing the civil war in Greece, but the Russians
did not then appear to be interested in Egyptian
politics. Subsequently, however, when Russian
.and British interests came into conflict, Com-
munist tactics became apparent in the student
movements which spearheaded the anti-British
campaign. The Egyptian Government gave
■way to the popular clamor against, the British,
without seeming to see the possibility of the
Russians moving in if the British went out.—

Even in attempting to demonstrate a spirit
of co-operation, Russian diplomats can be
almost as exasperating as when they are acting
tough. When the U.N.O. Steering Committee
met to draw up the agenda for the*General
Assembly, Andrei Vishinsky announced his
opposition to everything on the tentative pro-
gramme. He did not want the Assembly to
discuss proposals for a modification of the
Big-Power veto. He was opposed to taking up
the South African plan for annexation of man-
dated territory, and he objected to debating a
Canadian rule that would limit the length of
speeches. He spoke on each of these issues,
seconded in each instance by the equally-voluble
Dr. Manuilsky, spokesman for the Ukraine.
When the other nations declared in favor of
free and open discussion, Vishinsky capitulated,
in apparent good humor. He took almost as
long in discussing his decision to abandon his
objections as he did in making his original
arguments. Four hours were consumed in
routine matters which should have been dis-
posed of in 20 minutes. Just before the com-
mittee recessed the Soviet delegate suddenly
challenged the right of the Social Welfare
Committee to consider a declaration on human
rights, insisting such an issue belonged in the
Political Committee. The Russian delegate
argued the issue with the same determination
he would have employed had a major question
been involved. Situations such as this suggest
that a great deal of the difficulty with the
Russians is owing to their unfamiliarity with
ordinary parliamentary procedure. N.Y.

Britain’s latest plan of Empire defence might
be stated as a strategic retreat to a stronger
line. Its most striking feature is a 3000-mile
defence belt across the neck of Africa con-
necting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans by a
land-water route held open by air power. So
far it is -a vast conception only in the blue-
print stage. % For more than a century England
regarded the Mediterranean, defended at both
ends and along its southern side, as the vital
link with her eastern dominions. But the
war, with the swift rise of air power and the
almost-successful German drive along the
African littoral, demonstrated what a vulner-
able link it has become. Moreover, post-war
political developments have compelled a revision
of British' strategy. The rise of nationalism in
Egypt is forcing the British to withdraw their
forces. Their position in Libya and the Sudan
remains uncertain. Troubled Palestine is too
small to support or supply adequate bases.
Syria has been abandoned by both French
and British, and Irak is now an exposed
British outpost. Ferment throughout the
Arab world imperils British control all over
the Near East. Nevertheless, the old first
line of defence would not be given up. It
would be strengthened and. held as long as
possible. No unfriendly Power will be per-
mitted to thrust itself into the Middle Sea.
What is proposed is a dispersal in depth. The
African transcontinental belt could not be
easily attacked. It would lengthen England’s
Commonwealth communications but add to
their security. With the constantly-increasing
range of armed flight, it would constitute a
broad base from which even the Mediterranean
might be defended. French consent would be
necessary, for the projected road across Africa
cuts across French Equatorial Africa. This
land bridge already exists and was used to-
ward the end of the war to excellent advan-
tage. It would have to be enormously ex-
panded if it is to be made 1*010,3 satisfactory
military highway. Its outlets would be in
I? Nigeria on the west and in Kenya on the east.
At each end great airfields and naval bases
would be installed. The plan is a grandiose
one but seems to offer a sound solution for
an ever more pressing problem. The British
Commonwealth, entrenched in the heart of
Africa, might stand firm once more. N.Y.

THE LITTLE DOGS BARK.
At the root of the troubles which are
convulsing Australia and threatening to
bring on another depression, of which the
current production slump may be the
first and least serious instalment, are
the stupidity and moral cowardice of
“ ‘Labor’ Governments” and politicians,
above all the ..crowd at Canberra.
Blind to the calamitous effects of
drought, though it will affect its own
revenues, and to the legitimate feature
of the industrial discontents, for which
feature it is itself responsible, this Can-
berra crowd is spending’money like water,
in ministering to place- and holiday-
hunters in its own favored circle, among
many other ways, from the proceeds of
crippling taxation, the harshest in the
Empire. And with the second year of
“peace” well advanced, it is continuing
to let Communists exploit the industrial
discontents in the interest of the Moscow
policy of striking at the British Common-
wealth wherever it can be: struck at.
For 15 months the “Government” has
permitted these Communists, led in
Queensland by an adventurer from Bel-
fast with a police record and an alias,
to make a hideous mockery of its
much-advertised foreign policy as it
concerns the Dutch in their East
Indies. Though clinging to its supreme
war-time powers, unchallenged in in-
dustrial matters, it has allowed Com-
munists and their imitators to hold up
transport and industry in all the main-
land States with impunity. It has been
a silent spectator of all their destructive
strikes and stoppages and go-slow per-
formances, though every one of these
outrages on the nation has been an
offence against the industrial laws, with
the execution of which it is charged.
With 43 out of 74 voting members in
the House and 21 out of 36 in the Senate,
the 'll soon to be increased to 33, this
crowd might be expected to exhibit at
least a show of courage in Parliament;
but even there its moral cowardice has
been in evidence ever since Mr. Lang
took his seat at Canberra.
He arrived there a lone Independent
with a long record of frustration. It is
14i years since he and his Ministers,
among them Mr. McKell, were dismissed
by Governor Game. During the 14i
years he lost three State elections and
contributed to the losing of three Com-
monwealth elections. Thereupon rejected
by his previously obsequious followers,
he figured in the N.S.W. Assembly in
1941 as a party of one, increased in 1944
to a party of two, the recruit being a
lady. Elected to the House last Septem-
ber, after a defeat in 1943, he saw in the
seats of the mighty Mr. Ashley and Mr.
Armstrong, in the Senate ; Mr. Ward, in
the House, and, behind Mr. Ward, Mr.
Lazzarini and Mr. James. In the
Speaker’s Chair was Mr. Rosevear, and
when the House went into committee the
chairman was Mr. Clark. All these
worthies, and with them Mr. Mulcahy
and Mr. Sheehan, M.H.R., and Senator
Amour, were “Lang Is Right” identities,
and at Mr. Lang’s instance Mr. Ward,
Mr. Lazzarini and Mr. James, together
with Mr. Beasley and Mr. Gander, now
departed to other pastures —greener in
Mr. Beasley’s case—encompassed the de-
feat of the Scullin Labor Government
on a Beasley motion.
Mr. Lang just on 70. On that ac-
count and the other accounts, scarcely a
figure for anyone to fear; but feared he
is, alike by the members of his old fac-
tion and by at least the old members of
the other faction. This was made clear
from the moment he spoke oh the
address-in-reply. His remarks were brief,
but so devastating that Ministers—there
are 14 in the House —were reduced to
confusion. They not only failed to
answer the man themselves or to put up
one of their young hopefuls to do it for
them, but let the debate collapse there
and then, though they had planned to
carry it on for a couple of weeks, hav-
ing no other business in hand.
Came the debate on the Budget and
another Lang speech. Delayed, in his
own words, because “the Government
resorted to all. kinds of stratagems to
prevent my speaking,” it was delivered at
last, though at “an unfavorable time for
broadcasting,” and then only in part be-
cause' of persistent interjections, the
ordinary courtesy of an extension of time
being refused. Even so, Mr. Lang stirred
the House again. This time it had
been arranged to put up a Mr. Burke to
reply for the party; but as Mr. Burke
was a boy in Perth when the Langs, Mc-
Kells and Wards were throwing their
weight about in Sydney, his performance
as knight-errant was unconvincing,
though the unfortunate young man did
his best. Mr, Burke having retired, pre-
sumably to turn over in his mind the
long, long thoughts of youth, the Speaker
divested himself of his non-combatant
trappings and advanced to the lists.
Only in a “Labor”-controlled Parlia-
ment could such a scene be witnessed. Mr.
Speaker not only delivered a ferocious
attack on Mr. Lang, largely on the score
of the policy of the Lang Government,
which he himself supported in all its
phases, but struck at members of the
Opposition, applying to one, in terms
grossly personal, a Ward vulgarisation of
lines from “The Man with the Hoe.”
Having done the job assigned to him by
the 14 Ministers, he resumed his place in
the Chair, where, according to tradition,
even Australian tradition, the Speaker is
required to sit above the battle, the im-
personation of impartiality and custodian
of the rights of all members, even those
whom he may hate to see hanging round.
It was impossible for Mr. Lang to
reply to the Speaker, turned bitter parti-
san ; but he must have spent a mordant
hour turning up the partisan Speaker’s
tributes to him after Mr. Rosevear’s elec-
tion for Dailey as a grovelling “Lang Is
Right” man in October,, 1931. They are
all recorded'in the Parliamentary reports.
In the Rosevear contributions to the de-
bates during the period when the Lang
Government was speeding to its doom
there is not a hint of opposition to any
feature or detail of the Lang policy
which the Speaker has found matter for
scorn after the lapse of years. On
the contrary, Mr. Rosevear praised Mr.
Lang to the skies, while denouncing and
ridiculing the Lyons Government’s
efforts to bring him and his Ministers to
their bearings..
Lang dole methods and Lang tax and
social-security measures were attacked
by this extraordinary Speaker on Novem-
ber 26, 1946. He had nothing but praise
for them in December, 1931, when he
came out on the Lang ticket for Dailey
—which any bellman or billsticker could
have won with the Lang nomination —
and when he arrived at Canberra:
Some months ago the N.S.W. Govern-
ment was prepared to put in hand very
large public works on which the expen-
diture of £8,000,000 was contemplated,
and it could have raised that money with-
out the assistance of the banks and the
Loan Council. The Loan Council placed
obstacles in the way (May 6, 1932; Han-
sard, p. 458).
Some hon. members opposite have said
it would be a step in the right direction ’
if the money being spent in providing doles
were applied to the construction of useful
public works. The N.S.W. Government has
adopted that practice. ( Hansard, p. 459).
Mr. Speaker (no, he wasn’t that then)
had previously thrust himself forward as
a prophet, and he was to make other
appearances in this role:
The supporters of the Lyons Govern-
ment may blame Mr. Lang as much as
they like about the present position but
the day will come when they will be forced
to admit that the Premier of N. S. Wales
has taken up a correct attitude. When that
day does arrive the only thing which I
fear is that some of them will be killed
in the scramble to get to the front to pro-
claim that they themselves were the
originators of the Lang plan. (May 4,
1932; Hansard, p. 349).
The Prime Minister and his supporters
will be sadly disappointed when the Lang
Government is returned to office Mr.
Lang will be returned by an overwhelming
majority, and social benefits will not, as
this Government anticipates, be abolished.
(May 17, 1932; Hansard, p. 819).
Mr. Rosevear was not in the House
when Mr. Lyons introduced his Financial
Emergency (State Legislation) Bill to pre-
vent the Lang Government confiscating
mortgage-investment funds of life-assur-
ance societies, trustee companies and
other concerns and individuals, “with a
final drastic provision to seize the mort-
gage altogether.” What detained the
gentleman who is now Speaker is not on
record, but it cannot be doubted that if
he had been present he would have voted,
with Mr. Ward, Mr, James and Mr.
Gander, his fellow-members of the Lang
group, against the bill dishing the con-
fiscatory tax. Mr. Ward shouted “The
Commonwealth Ministry’s every move
will be forestalled by Mr. Lang” (May
13, 1932; Hansard, p. 750), and “You
want to crucify Lang” was one of Mr.
Gander’s contributions. This idea was
expanded by Mr. James when the opera-
tion of the measure was suspended in
another enactment, Mr. Lang and his
Ministers having in the meantime been
dismissed by Governor Game. Said Mr.
James, referring to the imminent election
at which the Rosevear prophecy went
west:
Mr. Lang adopted a Christ-like attitude,
and now the Prime Minister and his fol-
lowers are prepared to crucify him as
Christ himself was crucified by men of
the same type.
Perhaps it was with confused memories
of this bathos, and of “one” who “took
a sponge and filled it with vinegar and
put it on a reed and gave Him to drink,”
that Mr. James, while the former god of
his idolatry was hitting out at “the Right
Wing of the Labor party,” “placed a
glass of water on the desk in front of
Mr. Lang.” And perhaps Mr. James
was under the impression that scared
silence would continue to be the party’s
attitude towards Mr. Lang.
The change to an equally ignoble
offensive-defensive was made with the
idea of blunting the force of Mr. Lang’s
attack on the Jewish-immigration busi-
ness. The member for Reid had given
notice of intention to move for the Calwell-
refused tabling of the papers concerning
the Palestine Jews and other aliens who
came from the Middle East in the Strath-
more, getting preference over “passengers
stranded in England” ; and in his speech
he made statements which should have
brought an instant promise of a reference
to a Judge with a royal commission;
statements involving Mr. Morgan, his pre-
decessor in Reid, and Mr. Chairman-of-
Committees Clark, in the “refugee racket”
—so described in the heading to a Com-
monwealth Security Police report.
Denials of the charges came immedi-
ately from Mr. Clark and from Mr.
Morgan, when he was acquainted with
them. “Lying” was one of the expressions
used by Mr. Clark. Mr, Calwell, for his
part, persisting in his refusal to table the
papers (though he said Mr. Menzies and
Mr. Fadden might see them), called Mr.
Lang “this Australian Julius Streicher”
(one of the criminals hanged at Nurem-
berg), uttered other words about him and
a supporter which would be pronounced
criminal slander in any Supreme Court,
and asserted that, “if the question be one
of so many thousands a boatload,” which
he refused to entertain (“I do not believe
one single member of this Parliament
took one penny”), “then apparently
members opposite have been exercising
acquisitive qualities to a greater degree
than anybody else in Parliament”:
I have had no more constant customer
than Mr. Harrison [Deputy-leader of the
Liberals]. If there be anything sinister in
the issue of landing permits, as the filthy
mind of Mr, Lang caused him to suggest,
then Mr. Harrison has benefited to a greater
degree than anybody else in Parliament.
This outpouring of mud from a muddy
spring brought no reproof from the
Speaker, nor was Mr. Clark’s use of the
unparliamentary term “lying” objected
to by that officer. But when Mr. Harri-
son gave the Minister the lie he was
ordered to withdraw and apologise, and
on his refusing to do so unless the
Minister apologised he was “named” and
suspended—suspended at the instance of
Comrade Mountjoy’s patron, Mr. Ded-
man. So. was Mr. Anthony, whose
offence consisted in his saying “Name
the Minister, too,” countered from the
Chair with “I’ll name you!”
Whether he scares Ministerialists stiff
or becomes a target for their forcible-
feeble stuff, Mr. Lang has been a means
of bringing home to the nation the im-
becility and pusillanimity with which it
is governed.
The Returned Digger's Lot.
Probably for no worse reason than that
present-day journalism likes nothing half
so much as a row, threats of breakaway
over the membership issue in the R.S.L.
have blotted out the better League activi-
ties. Consequently little gets known of
the sterling work being done all the
time by this staunchest of Australian
organisations in its capacity as watchdog
guarding Digger interests. A very neces-
sary watchdog. What would be the lot
of the Digger if it wasn’t there is seen by
looking into the business done at the
Federal Congress, little of it reported," and
into the Mountjoy job.
At this Federal Congress Digger issues
were numbered in hundreds. Their great
number alone indicates how much is not
right in the country’s treatment of those
who served it in uniform during the war.
Where so much under so many, heads has
to receive constant attention it is quite
evident that a great deal must be wrong
It is definite that without the League
the wrongs wo\ild never be righted.
The need for the watchdog is also
strongly pointed by the nature of many of
the decisions; requests that most people,
with a full appreciation of the country’s
debt to all its fighting services, would ex-
pect to be granted out of hand.
For example, Diggers want to see
the war pensions of those fully in-
capacitated raised to at least £6 6s.
per fortnight, with a corresponding
increase in all other war pensions.
It seems little enough considering
that N.S.W. “Labor” values the
services of Assemblymen defeated or re-
tired after 15 years in “Parliament” at
£6 a week. The abolition of the means
test in respect of dependants’ war pen-
sions seems merely a fair thing to ask,
as is also the case with the request that
medical treatment should be provided for
all returned men, great numbers of whom
still have tropical fever in their bones,
without placing on them the onus of
proof that their ailments are attributable
to war service.
Land-settlement of Diggers—rather, the
absence of it —naturally requires constant
attention when such decisions as these
are still called for:
The Commonwealth Government will
again be urged to finance soldier-settlement
of single farms.
It will be urged that the war gratuity be
paid to a soldier-settler desirous of estab-
lishing his home on the land in like manner
to a serviceman desiring to purchase a
war-service home.
No. 1 priority will be sought for ex-
servicemen in the purchase of all farm
machinery for rehabilitation purposes.
Such requests are so obviously reason-
able that the whole wonder about them
is that they have to be made. On a wider,
long-term, national basis in soldier-settle-
ment the Congress decided to ask for
more agricultural colleges in all the
States for training purposes, and for
a general water - conservation scheme
for all Australia. Other typical requests
included the granting of pensions on
compassionate grounds. Cases of Diggers
in extreme need could be listed under this
heading that would move a heart of
stone. One or two have had Bulletin
mention ; extremely sick Diggers depend-
ing, with their folk, on what this or that
Digger body can manage to do for them.
So the listing of the recent Congress
decisions could run on, ranging from
representations that no further transfers
of real property to aliens be permitted
until the needs of ex-servicemen have
been met, and that British Empire people
be given preference over aliens as immi-
grants, to arranging X-ray examination
for T.B. for all discharged personnel two
years after date of discharge and legis-
lation entitling all ex-service personnel
to be admitted to any union, provided
they have the ability to carry out the class
of work to the satisfaction of their em-
ployers.
These are merely some of the scores
of Congress decisions; they give only a
rough idea of the work the R.S.L. is
doing. They are enough, however, to
indicate the need for the strongest pos-
sible R.S.L. Because the need for their
organisation is so important to them-
selves all round it would be a great pity,
for their own sakes, if any Diggers were
much influenced by newspapers more in-
terested in their rows than in their needs.
The little rows, of course, have turned
on the Congress majority decision —four
States to two —in favor of extending
membership eligibility to those who
volunteered for service abroad without
managing to see such service. Diggers
have been discussing the issue in Bulletin
pages, but one or two points might be
worth emphasising. For one thing, under
the League constitution every sub-branch
has the right to say whom it will have or
not have as a member. That cannot be
ordered by State branches or even by
Federal Congress ; it is a sub-branch pre-
rogative ; and, in fact, sub-branches have
been advised to exercise discretion and
careful choice in making admissions to
membership.
That completely disposes of the rather
wild notion that under the new member-
ship ruling genuine Diggers will have to
have with them the scum that put in
time in detention camps to dodge having
to go abroad. The sub-branches can set
up qualification committees, with the onus
on the applicant to prove his eligibility
and suitability for membership. There-
fore all the row that newspapers have
been airing is ridiculous.
As to the question of whether member-
ship eligibility should have been extended
to include other than returned men, this
turns largely on a simple difference of
viewpoints regarding the League:
whether it should be in the nature of
an exclusive club composed of those in
uniform who have been out of Australia
(whether they ever saw a shot fired or
not), or whether it should be an organ-
isation composed of those in the very
large majority, with the addition of
others who volunteered to serve any-
where and who, while not getting abroad,
actually did serve, very necessarily, on
lines of communication and the like.
In the final analysis the vital point to
the Diggers is that they should remain
organised as the great unified body the
League has been. Divided into groups
under fancy titles they will have no
power to serve either Diggers or Aus-
tralia. The Diggers will always ha.ve the
need for their watchdog; and the bigger
and stronger the watchdog the better.
Any number of yelping poodles would
be a poor substitute.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Our American Friends.
“On board the liner Wisteria, which left
Sydney on November 28, were 10 U.S. Army
personnel returning to America from service
in Australia. The troops were the last base-
command personnel to leave Australia for
America.”
On Glebe Island —an island which has
the peculiarity of not being one —a
memorial obelisk, with plaque, now
commemorates the first landing of
American troops in Australia. They
came ashore on that triangle point of
land in Johnston’s Bay, Sydney Harbor,
at a time when no sight could have been
more welcome, to those who saw them
arrive. They were the vanguard of a
million of their countrymen, coming with
their limitless supplies to help save Aus-
tralia,
America’s greatest soldier, General
MacArthur, had been ordered south to
lead them and Australia’s own forces in
that campaign. General MacArthur
landed on March 17, 1942, after conduct-
ing the heroic but hopeless defence of
Bataan and Corregidor. The Japs were
in the full rush of their southward sweep,
and were to come menacingly close. On
January 26, 1943 —Australia Day and
General MacArthur’s birthday—-the Aus-
tralian Prime Minister broadcast:
As I speak the enemy is assailing with
all his strength the outer fringe of islands
near the Australian mainland. If these go
we are faced with a struggle on our own
soil, with the enemy in command of all sea
approaches If Australia falls the whole
west coast of the Americas faces the on-
slaught of Japan.
In retrospect it seems a panic-stricken
appeal; but it is as well to remember
times when such an appeal could have
been made by a Prime Minister.- It
is as well to remember, too, that his
Government contained men —in office
today—-who had fought at the loudest
their mouths could manage to prevent the
formation of the Second A.1.F., the re-
introduction of universal service and the
sending of a man outside the Australian
map boundary to fight for this country.
There might well be a really great
national memorial commemorating what
is obscurely marked by the “eight-foot
high obelisk of brick and cement” un-
veiled last week by N.S.W. Premier Mc-
Kell. Generosity, except in party ap-
pointments at the country’s expense, is
not a notable Government virtue at Can-
berra, but enough of it should be screwed
up to make a Commonwealth tribute,
which could be to General MacArthur,
both for himself and for all that of his
fighting countrymen and his country
which Australia will never forget. It
would be an honor to Australia,
An Insult to the Crown.
In a dispassionate and reasoned protest
against the nomination of the N.S.W.
“Labor” Premier as Governor-General,
Mr. Menzies, speaking for all the Liberals,
and with the endorsement of Mr.
Fadden and all the C.P. members, said
that such an appointment would “lower
confidence in the office, establish a pre-
cedent in spoils to the victors, exhibit a
crude contempt for the remaining pre-
rogatives of the Crown, and could be
misunderstood abroad as evidence of anti-
Empire sympathy in Australia.”
Only the last point is questionable. It
could have been rammed home by a cita-
tion of the “Government’s” public oppo-
sition to the Food for Britain movement,
its repeated refusal to send a food ship
to Britain, its one-man-band perform-
ances at peace and U.N.O. conferences,
its abject surrender to the Communist
“policy” for Indonesia —at the cost of
Australia’s trade with that country as
well as its duty to send supplies to the sick
and hungry and to the British troops
protecting them, and to repair Dutch
ships—and its opening of the gates to
foreign Jews at a time when foreign Jews,
with world-wide Jewish support, are en-
gaged in a revolt against British policy in
Palestine, a revolt made horrible by
terrorist gangs who have committed many
foul murders and other outrages, and
have even threatened the lives of the
Royal family. Expressed as a policy,
“not another Jewish immigrant until the
Jewish crimes cease” might have a dis-
tinct influence for good on affairs in
Palestine.
Mr. Menzies forbore to go into these
grave matters. He admitted that “the
King is bound, in the last resort, to act
on the advice of his Ministers in the
exercise of his power of appointment.”
But, he added.
It is equally true that Ministers exer-
cising the responsibility of advice should
not forget that the man appointed is to act
as the trusted personal representative of
the King, and not as the political represen-
tative of the Australian Government for
the time being. The greatest consideration
should be given to his Majesty’s wishes in
the matter.
.Mr- Chifley replied in the ungracious
terms which characterised his utterances
last week. He professed to “believe” that
“the statement made by Mr. Menzies”
would “cause some embarrassment” and
was “intended to do so.” He did not
deny that the McKell appointment was
contemplated.
Nothing came from the Government’s
Constitutional authority. Dr. Evatt. As
that gentleman well knows, Mr. McKell,
when a member of the Lang Ministry
(1931-32), was a party not only to
anti-British proceedings which re-
main notorious, but to default in
the payment of interest to the Com-
monwealth, required under the Finan-
cial Agreement, which is part of
the Constitution, and to calculated and
persistent resistance to the operation of
the Financial Agreements Enforcement
measures held valid by a majority judg-
ment of the High Court —Dr. Evatt and
the aged Duffy constituted the minority.
In his The King and His Dominion Gov-
ernors, Dr. Evatt has given an account
of the exchanges which culminated in the
dismissal of Mr. Lang and his Ministers,
Mr. McKell among them, by Governor
Game. Pertinent extracts:
On May 12, 1932, the Governor called
the .attention of the Premier to a Cabinet
circular (April 12) which the Ministers had
issued to all departments directing officers
(1) to refrain from meeting governmental
expenditure by the drawing of cheques,
(2) to hold all moneys collected, forward-
ing them to the Treasury, and (3) to insist
upon payment to the Government in cash
or by bearer cheque. The object of this
direction was to avoid, as far as possible,
the operation of the Federal law requiring
banks to pay moneys of the State to
Federal officers. But a Federal regulation
(Proclamation No. 42 of 1932) had also
been issued by the Governor-General which
purported to direct officers of the State
receiving revenue of a certain character to
deal with the moneys in the manner direc-
ted by the Federal Treasurer.
Governor Game to Premier Lang (May
12): “It appears to me that the terms of
LEST WE FORGET.
"Do ye ken the poseetion, Mountjoy? Ye’re on the st-r-rength of the C.S.I.R-r-r
—NOT the U.S.S.R-r-r."
this circular direct public servants to com-
mit a direct breach of the law aS set out
in Proclamation 42.... I feel it my bounden
duty to remind you at once that you derive
your authority from his Majesty through
me, and that I cannot possibly allow the
Crown to be placed in the position of
breaking the law of the land.” The letter
concluded with a request to the Premier
“either to furnish me with proof that the
instructions in the circular are within the
law, or, alternatively, to withdraw the
circular at once.”
The reply of the Premier complained of
the Governor’s ultimatum and stated that
the circular could not possibly be with-
drawn. “I have just received your letter,” the
Governor wrote.... “I gather from it that
you do not dispute my view that the circular
in question is a breach of the Federal law.”
It went on to suggest an interview when
the Premier asked the Governor to com-
fmunicate his views by letter.
The letter was immediately sent and
stated: “The position as I see it is that
Ministers are committing a breach of the
law. While you did not admit this, you
did not deny it My position is that if
my Ministers are unable to carry on essen-
tial services without breaking the law, my
plain duty is to endeavor to obtain Minis-
ters who feel able to do 50....1f Minis-
ters are not prepared to abide by the law
then I must state without any hesitation
that it is their bounden duty under the
law and practice of the Constitution to
tender their resignation.”
The Premier’s answer: “If your letter
means that you are requesting the resig-
nation of Ministers you are hereby in-
formed that your request is refused.”
The final letter from the Governor then
i came. It stated that, in view of the refusal
of Ministers to resign or withdraw the
circular, “I feel it my bounden duty to
inform you that I cannot retain my present
Ministers in office and that I am seeking
other advisers.”
Only a “Labor” Government would
“allow the Crown to be placed in the
position” of appointing as its representa-
tive at Canberra a party politician who,
in common with his colleagues, was dis-
missed by another representative of the
Crown for “breaking the law of the
land.”
"Form 40."
Form 40 is a Commonwealth Govern-
ment document headed “Notification to
Elector Who Appears to Have Failed to
Vote.” As a consequence of the Sep-
tember elections, thousands of such
forms have been, or are being, sent out,
and, because of the state of the electoral
rolls —officially admitted to be shocking,
after the smell from the Ashfield sub-
division of Parkes (N.S.W.) had become
notorious —some of them are bringing
unnecessary grief and suffering to people
who have suffered much.
One “notification” was addressed to a
Bathurst (N.S.W.) airman who was
killed three years ago in operations over
Germany with the R.A.A.F. It was re-
ceived and opened by his mother.
Another was addressed to a serviceman
from Tatura (Vic.) who was killed in
action on July 24, 1944. That, too, was
opened by his mother. The grief of both
women —and many others who have re-
ceived or will receive similar letters —
must be painfully revived and charged
with bitterness against inefficiency when
they read cold, official threats to their
dead sons of fines “of not less than 10s.
and not more than two pounds” unless
the dead “give a valid, truthful and suffi-
cient reason” for not voting at an elec-
tion held over 12 months after the end
of the Japanese war, which dragged on
for a couple of months after the end of
the German war.
During the wars the services showed
the utmost consideration for the next-
of-kin of those who lost their lives. Un-
fortunate mistakes were sometipies
Unade, but they were few and far between,
and were certainly not the result of cal-
lous indifference. In the R.A.A.F., for
instance, “accuracy, speed, discretion and
tact in dealing with next-of-kin” was the
keynote of casualty procedure; official
advice to bereaved relatives was sent by
personal - delivery telegram, and no
further information was disclosed
until the postmaster in the town con-
cerned had confirmed delivery. Every
effort was made then, and in subsequent
communications, to ensure that the sad
tidings were delivered as gently as the
times and circumstances permitted.
It is probably too much to expect simi-
lar consideration from a “Government”
concerned with finding soft plums for de-
feated followers with no service record.
It was, however, the express duty of the
Electoral Department to get from the
services the names of all persons listed
as dead; all those who registered the
finest and most unselfish vote of all for
their country. On its own grudging ad-
mission it failed in this primary duty, and
it therefore stands condemned in the eyes
of all Australians who believe in clean
rolls, and who must feel appalled to think
that wounding and threatening communi-
cations should be sent to the mothers of
the honored dead.

If You Lose, You Win.
Written by a New Guinea Digger:
To spoils to the victors, an old “Labor”
practice, the present Federal “Labor” Govern-
ment has given a peculiar inverted twist by
which it has become Spoils to the Victors’
Vanquished Friends.
Eight “Labor” members of the 17th Parlia-
ment who aspired to sit in the 18th Parliament
had their election hopes dashed; but in the
course of eight weeks jobs have been found
for four.
Martens, former M.H.R. for Herbert, de-
feated in the party ballot, got his new billet
even before polling day, just in. case of acci-
dents, It was a seat on the board of Com-
monwealth Oil Refineries, from which the old
ex-Minister Fenton was evicted to make room
for Martens. »
Job No. 2 was found for “Stand up”
Bryson, defeated by Mrs. Blackburn in
Bourke, who was taken on as private sec-
retary by new Army Minister Chambers.
Bryson’s qualifications include a complete
ignorance of military affairs cultivated over
a lifetime and, presumably, a monstrous
attack on soldier-planters of New Guinea made
under cover of Parliamentary privilege, and
endorsed from behind the same hedge by his
Ministerial boss. There must have been hun-
dreds, thousands, of ex-A.I.F. men qualified
for the job that-Bryson got, hut ex-servicemen
are not the type of “victors” that “Labor”
hands out spoils to. Ex-Army Minister Forde,
of course, got the biggest plum at the disposal
of the victors, “Labor” apparently feeling that
Canada will be honored to receive the man
Capricomia rejected.
Latest of the defeated to find his way back
on to the payroll from which the electors
removed him is “Comrade” Mountjoy, a
political accident with Communist associations
who beguiled the voters of Swan (W.A.) into
putting him into Parliament for one term in
1943, used Parliamentary privilege to slander
an Australian shaken by the death of his only
son in battle, and failed to convince his
electors in September that he was still worthy
of their confidence. To Mountjoy goes an
appointment to the executive of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research. Experi-
ence as a railway guard and membership of the
A.R.U., along with rejection by the electors
and an enthusiastic devotion to the Moscow
crawl, were apparently just the qualifications
needed for the position, which carries a salary
of £5OO a year, plus fares and a travelling
allowance oL 30s. a day from his home in
Como, Perth —more than the pay of many
C.S.I.R. scientists with degrees.
When questioned whether any returned- men
were given the chance of applying for the
C.S.I.R. job Minister Dedman replied that
under the Act the appointment was entirely
his prerogative. So Mr. Dedman, the Minister
who introduced the Bill Which pretends to give
preference to ex-servicemen, when he has the
filling of an executive position in his gift does
not even give a moment’s thought to an ex-
serviceman, but hands the job' to a discredited
party hack!
In the debate which arose out of this
iniquitous appointment junior “Labor” mem-
bers Daly, Burke and Beazley rushed to defend
their comrade who had* so soon been raised
again to his feet. Their reward for party
loyalty will doubtless take the shape of a trip
abroad to “represent” Australia at an 1.L.0.
conference. That last rotting branch of the
dead League of Nations tree cost this country
£121,934 last year—£l9,233 for “representation”
and £102,701 for “contribution.” The total is
£51,934 more than was allowed for in the
Estimates, and the “contribution” alone is
£69,146 more than Australia’s share of the full
League expenditure in 1938.
Among the multitude of “Labor” politicians
who enjoyed the benefits of foreign travel under
the aegis of 1.L.0. and at the expense of the
taxpayers—along, of course, with Communists,
confessed or otherwise —are Comrades Lawson,
Collings, Haylen and Grant. Mr. Lawson’s trip
appears to have been a compensation for being
dropped from the Ministry, Senator Collings’s
as a reward for standing down, and all the
others as consolation prizes. In much less than
a twelvemonth Senator Grant, of I.W.W.
notoriety, has had two trips to Europe as
“adviser” to Dr. Evatt, as well as an 1.L.0.
jaunt to Canada.
Four of the eight “Labor” men rejected by
the electors have now been accommodated.
Of the others, the names of Mr. Frost and
Mr. Breen have already been canvassed for
the Moscow post, but the Moscow post doesn’t
seem as attractive as it did a few years ago.
Still, whether in Moscow or Molonglo, some-
thing is bound to turn up. “Labor” looks
after its own. In the meantime, there are bound
to be plenty more 1.L.0. trips. This year’s
Estimates allow for an expenditure of £73,300.
If last year’s figures are a true guide “Labor”
will just about double that sum, and that will
look after quite a lot of joy-riding “represen-
tatives.”
Foolish and Dangerous.
By a vote of 1445 to 1204, with 120
informals and 1400 refusals, the United
Graziers of Queensland have affirmed
that they are warranted in seeking statu-
tory power under Queensland law to
make membership of their association
compulsory. Unless it comes to its senses
the association will now draft a bill for
submission to the Brisbane Government,
upon which that Government will take
another poll and, if a majority favors
it, will make compulsory membership
law.
There are unanswerable arguments for
persuasion in matters like this, not the
least of them being that where a man
benefits from the work of an organisation
which cares for the interests and welfare
of his particular vocation it is his duty
to support that organisation by at least
becoming a member. But there is a vast
gulf between persuasion and compulsion,
and wherever an Australian loses his
right to be persuaded in matters of this
kind another freedom has been de-
stroyed.
The man who will not join an organi-
sation of his fellows may merit all the
hard names he is called, but he and he
only has the right of choice—and no vote
or legislative act can destroy that right.
To say that because 1445 graziers want
compulsion, 1204 who don’t want it
should have it forced upon them is as
fallacious as to say that because 1445
want to wear elastic-sided boots the 1204
should be compelled to wear them.
Compulsion of the kind sought by the
U.G.A. is no antidote to the party-
political, union and bureaucratic tyranny
now poisoning Australian life. Rather
is it another manifestation of national
illness.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
Peter Fraser’s Government has been
returned in Maoriland with a majority
of six in a House o v f 80 —reduced but
sufficient. There was very little between
Laborites and Nationalists in the pakeha
electorates, but, as in 1943, the four
Maori constituencies declared for Labor.
Obviously it was recognised by whites
and Maoris alike that Labor had a good
war record and has been active in hous-
ing and soldier-settlement; and certainly
it never came under suspicion of being
sold to the booze and betting interests.
The Tasmanian A.L.P. was shrewd
when it decided to run eight candidates
for each of the five six-member elec-
torates, and mainland party organisa-
tions, with their notions of restricting the
choice of electors to one nominee from
each party, could study the returns with
advantage. In every electorate each of
the new A.L.P. men turned in a vote that
was serviceable in the final accounting,
and three topped the “Labor” poll—Turn-
bull in Bass, Fagan in Wilmot and Reece
in Darwin ; and C. B. Aylett was next to
Reece, getting nearly as many primaries
as the four retiring members, Bugg,
Kelly, Lane and Smith. Indeed, so many
old-stagers, among them Ministers Tay-
lor (Wilmot), Lane (Darwin) and Culley
(Denison), polled poorly that if the
winning of the election had been left to
them it might have been lost. And, very
obviously. Liberals, were at a disadvan-
tage in pitting tickets of six against tickets
of eight.
Counting of preferences gave Tas.
“Labor” 16 seats, a loss of four, the
Liberals getting 12 and Independents
two —Townley in Denison and Gray in
Bass. Five years ago the A.L.P. won
four seats in each of the five electorates,
but only Bass gave it four seats this time.
Nine of the 12 Libs are new men. One
of them is Marriott, the soldier-son of the
soldier blinded at Bapaume 29 years ago,
whose resignation brought him a heart-
felt tribute from Premier Cosgrove, who
lost his own son in the second German
war.
There has been some falling out of
friends in our master-class. In an effort
to sabotage the Victorian harvest, Brown,
the Communist boss of the railwaymen's
union, put a ban on the delivery to
farmers of McKay - Massey - Harris
machinery, duplicates and parts; and
when the matter was brought up in the
Assembly by Opposition-Leader Mc-
Donald, Keon, the Labor member for
Richmond, said he was not going to
support a Government —his Government
—whose members have to rush to do
Brown’s bidding. Melbourne Trades Hall,
for its part, threatened to expel Brown
and his union. Then Monk, of the
A.C.T.U., told Chifley that he, Chifley,
would be -“responsible for untold in-
dustrial unrest between now and Christ-
mas” if he didn’t overcome his “fetish”
for wage-pegging. That same day, though
without Monk’s knowledge, the Canadian
Government “lifted all war-time controls
on wages and salaries,” It had already
substantially reduced its taxes —never so
crushing as Chifley’s.
Hearing of the case against Joseph
Goldberg, charged in Sydney with the
importation of unlicensed goods in
trunks labelled in the name of Senator
Keane’s widow, has been postponed till
February 10, Hearing of the case
against ex-Minister T. A. Foley, charged
at Brisbane with having had in his control
5331 b. of manufactured tobacco on which
excise had not been paid, was begun on
Thursday. It had. not been completed
when this page had a compulsory inter-
view with the printer.
Had the good unionist Cecil Kelly, of
Port Kembla, been able to get a house
he and Miss Mavis Crompton would have
been married long ago, and thus would
have had no need to be out together on
August 29. last, to become victims of the
beast, Game,'to the trial Judge who con-
demned him to death for murder and
rape “a monster unfit to live.” And
had the criminal law been enforced in
N. S. Wales as it should be enforced, the
beast would not have been abroad. He
got seven years in September, 1941, for a
brutal assault, with attempted rape, on a
girl near Homebush (Sydney), but
“Labor” yoomanitarianism turned him
loose within five years. How many more
of his kind are on the prowl can only be
conjectured, but every woman who walks
alone by night walks under the threat of
attack. And the sentence on Garvie will
be do deterrent, for, apparently, it is not'
to be carried out, “Labor” being so kind-
hearted.
Aften long debate and with plenty of
opposition, the S.A. Assembly passed the
enabling act which brings its State into
the Commonwealth wheat-stabilisation
scheme—provided a poll of wheatgrowers
endorses it. Richards, “Labor,” has
warned them against rejecting it:
If the growers are not prepared to accept
a plan to stabilise their industry, •so far
as I am concerned they will get no farmers’
assistance from the Treasury and no debt
adjustment in' the future.
He might even try to stop them from
drawing unemployment relief.
Free labor, most of it Digger, worked
a Dutch ship at Pinkenba (Q.) last week,
the ship being, of course, “black” to the
Communist-controlled Wharfies’
There was, too, a “black” ban on haulage^ 1
to the ship by the Transport Workers’
Union, but that had been anticipated ;
cargo was delivered to the wharf before
the ship arrived. There have been no
assaults on the Digger workers, Diggers
being nasty people to assault.
Hamilton, C.P., conqueror of Mount-
joy in Swan, made Opposition members
laugh by reading a telegram from the ex-
uberant Haylen, who was so dead-lucky
to be returned in Parkes:
Commandos can be killed, but their spirit
lives on.
There was more to it, but the rest doesn’t
matter. Mountjoy a commando. One
might as well picture Forde as a para-
trooper.
Haylen on the contest in Parkes, the
smell of which persists:
I admit my majority was only 164; but
the election was won honestly The
thousand people who left since the rolls ,
were printed vacated accommodation in
rooms and occupied houses built by the
State Government.
This must have staggered even the
effusive N.S.W. Housing Minister, Mc-
Girr, Haylen has also insinuated that his
Liberal opponent, Richardson, was “set”
in Ashfield because of his poor attendance
record as M.L.A. for that subdivision.
If this feeling existed it should have been
shown when Richardson went up for re-
election, He has published the figures for
the four Ashfield polling places;

“The weak ghosts of the Liberal party
still haunt this Chamber,” Haylen blith-
ered, Obviously a great many robust
ghosts “haunted” the Parkes electorate
till scared away from Ashfield by Liberal
watchers at the by-election.
Rumblings from Spring-street, Mel-
bourne, indicate that most of the “Labor”
Ministers have been won over to Health
Minister Barry’s pet scheme of a lottery
in Victoria, one of the two States without
the degrading and demoralising, things,
the baft used being that profits will go
towards succoring needy hospitals and
building new ones. Barry’s lottery is
expected to yield half a million in the
first year, rising to £2,000,0CX). No men-
tion of the obvious fact that this enor-
mous sum will be a direct tax on the
worker. It is he and his wdfe who will
buy most of the tickets. The citizens
who have hitherto contributed to keep
the sickbays going have been the better-
off ones. They will conclude that with
a lottery to do it there is no need for
their contributions —or to leave charitable
legacies in their wills.
The death of James Cornell, president
of the Westralian Leg. Council, has
added to W. M. Hughes’s unique record.
Since Pearce’s exit (1938) the sole 1901
Federal member remaining in Parlia-
ment, and since the passing of Watson
(1941) the sole survivor of the first
Federal Labor Ministry, Billy has be-
come the last of the Labor conscrip-
tionists of 1916-17 still in action. Of
his followers in all the Houses (14 in
1916-17) Cornell had for years been the
only one left.
From a veteran Queensland fisherman:
In the House on November 21 Riordan, one
of the five service Ministers {he is Navy),
announced that the floating mines in process
of being cleared from North Queensland coastal
waters were fitted with a safety device which
made them harmless to shipping when they
broke adrift. Four days later three fishermen
and their 45ft. craft were blown to bits off
Palm Island, and five other near-by fishing
boats had narrow escapes. Three loose mines
had been seen in the neighborhood the pre-
vious week; others had been encountered in
the Townsville-Cairns area almost daily, and
seven were sighted during a fishing trip from
Townsville to the Outer Barrier. A Navy
spokesman in Brisbane has admitted that not
enough men or ships are available under the
demobilisation scheme to sweep all known
mines, and the now-distressed Riordan gave
the number of ships that were employed in
the Caims-Townsville area as three. With
the onset of the north-west season rough seas
will increase the danger till April by freeing
more mines and making them less readily visible
(from small craft. If more sweepers cannbt be
made available Riordan should at least arrange
for an air-reconnaissance system and for imme-
diate transmission of information to fishermen
and others likely to be imperilled.
In South Australia, as in Westralia,
early estimates of a good wheat crop
have had to be revised downward. The
September rains failed in the West and
S.A. has been visited by rust and hot
winds. Apart from wheat losses, damage
to barley crops reckoned at a million
Australian has been done. And all this
at a time when drought has cut land
production to pieces in Queensland and
N. S. Wales, both States being seriously
short of wheat for home use, as well as
having lost enormous numbers of stock.
There was a time when Commonwealth
Governments were vitally interested in
such things; but to “Labor” they are
much less important than the billeting on
the taxpayer of defeated “Labor” poli-
ticians like Bryson and Mountjoy.
before death struck him down —too
soon —Commonwealth Arbitration Judge
O’Mara, who knew his countrymen in-
timately alike in war and peace, warned
racketeering union bosses that if they per-
sisted in trying to bludgeon and black-
mail wage-payers into granting huge and
lawless concessions, the wage-payers,
being Australians and human, would
sooner or later retaliate. Retaliation has
now arrived on a scale so large that,
among others, many thousands of Mel-
bourne foundrymen and Sydney dock-
workers, most of whom never wanted
trouble, are idle. They know too well
that their affairs are in the hands of reck-
less fools, with no more brains than
beetles have, but they can’t resist the
fools without being branded as “scabs”
and persecuted with all the ferocity of
larrikin-push law, with ape-like Moscow
malignity added. And no help comes
from their political “leaders” —only an
occasional bleat and a fluttering of
palsied hands.
Stoppages and threats of stoppages
abounded in Melbourne at the week-end.
Employees in 90 factories and 60,000 men
in metal industries were ruefully con-
templating disemployment; and the
“militancy” of engineers in cold-storage
establishments was a threat to the city
milk and food supplies, with production
of milk bottles and other glass products
also menaced, Melbourne’s electricity
supply is not yet threatened, though it
soon will be, and the gas supply
“Labor” is blithely “nationalising” the
whole outfit—was off from Saturday to
Sunday. Almost the only industry which
isn’t threatened is the gambling industry.
There is talk of a State lottery, and the
“Labor” Government is bringing in a bill
to provide for night trotting at the Show-
grounds.
Though the League of Nations is dead
and buried, its 1.L.0. lingers on, and in
point of “conferences” and the like the
1.L.0. has become an impudent racket.
Every year a band of Labor Ministers,
minor politicians, secretaries, trade-union
bosses and an employer or two goes off
to the annual 1.L.0. Conference, held
always in some distant and expensive
country (never the same in consecutive
years), and every two or three months
minor “Labor” politicians, secretaries and
other trade-union bosses swarm to an
“interim conference” or something of the
kind. There is generally a Commpnist
among the trade-union bosses, and there
is always a dearth of information as to
what the “conferences” run to in terms of
taxpayers’ money, and what, if anything,
is done at them.
A Washington postscript to the
Canadian report on the Russian spy ring,
one of whose leaders, the Communist
Jew M.P. Rose, is now serving a stiff
sentence;
Employed in the 1.L.0. office at Montreal
was a Miss Hermina Rabinowitch. Miss
Rabinowitch testified that she had received
10,000 dollars from a Russian agent in
New York for transfer to a Russian agent
in Gene Va. She sought to enter the United
States from Canada to press her application
for American citizenship, and was excluded.
The Washington office of the 1.L.0. said
Miss Rabinowitch was severed from the
organisation in May.
The sooner Australia is “severed from
the organisation” which employed at least
one Russian spy the better the taxpayer
will like it.
Hutchinson, M.H.R., asked Chifley
whether he would appoint a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the activities,
sources of funds and other matters of in-
terest connected with the Australian Com-
munist party. He replied with a sneer in
his voice (rare with him) that he would
certainly consider the suggestion that
all suggestions put to him were con-
sidered. There were roars of cynical
laughter in his party ranks. Chifley him-
self seemed to be suffering from the mirth
of a man who is challenged to embrace a
hungry 30ft. crocodile.
Drought in N. S. Wales and Queens-
land made it obvious months ago that
both States would be short of wheat for
their own needs this year. So naturally
Canberra, which owns all the wheat in
Australia under the Scully “stabilisation”
scheme, has begun to think about shifting
Victorian and S.A. wheat northward,
Brown of the A.R.U. permitting. Pol-
lard, who succeeded Scully as Minister
of Agriculture, made a great to-do about
“directing” the Australian Wheat Board
to send 20,000,000 bushels to the stricken
States. The estimate is that 60 River-
class steamers or 33,000 15-ton rail trucks
will be necessary to shift that amount,
and since neither ships nor trains any
longer run to schedule, it looks as though
Pollard will have to offer his unit of the
fleet of fluid-drive Chryslers as a rein-
forcement. .
“S. M. Herald” sees in the setting-up
by the Federal executive of the A.L.P.
of a “standing sub-committee to advise
the Government on industrial affairs a
chance of a better balance between the
political and industrial wings,” and
thinks the move “should check the in-
creasing pressure of the unions in their
attempts to dictate industrial policy.” The
move may mean this. On the other hand,
it may merely mean a more complete and
a more efficient control of the Govern-
ment by a body outside Parliament and
having no responsibility to the electorate.


THE PIED HARPER.
“The Commonwealth Statistician's review supports the impression that permanent-migration figures are unfavorable. In August, a year after the end of the war with
Japan, Australia received 1941 immigrants, but permanent departures totalled 2606."

have shown that Granny retained a
faint sense of ordinary good taste in her
old age. But this failing among news-
papers is nothing new. Quoting Sir
Charles Adderly, who, in speaking to
Warwickshire farmers, had declared,
“Talk of improving the breed! Why,
the race we ourselves represent, the men
and women, the old Anglo-Saxon race,
are the best breed in did world,” Matthew
Arnold expressed doubts on the knight’s
statement. Newspapers of the time had
reported a case of infanticide in these
callous terms: “A shocking child
murder has just been committed in
Nottingham. A girl named Wragg left
the workhouse there on Saturday morning
with her young illegitimate child. The
child was afterwards found dead in
Mapperly hills, having been strangled.
Wragg is in custody.” On which Matthew
Arnold commented; “How much harsh
and ill-favored there is in the best of
breeds. Wragg is in custody” ... Cromp-

“Bo”; There is a type of American
who can always be depended upon
at short intervals to give a harassed
world a fleeting grin with some ratbag
stunt, from running a competition among
business “executives” to see who can
dictate most letters in a given time while
smoking a cigar right out and hanging
by the toes, to establishing a chain of
million-dollar hotels for the exclusive use
of pet dogs. It comes therefore as no
surprise that a “Be Kind to Insects” cam-
paign is to be inaugurated, complete no
doubt with the inevitable blah-blah con-
vention and ticker-tape storm. Its
sponsors will undoubtedly be the same
breeds of earnest short-haired women who
wear heavy tweed suits and collars and
ties and long-haired men who should be
wearing foundation garments, both of
which breeds, and their congeners in other
countries, work for the amelioration of
the jugged criminal’s lot with an ardency
exceeded only by their contempt for the
welfare of the criminal’s victims. I con-
fidently expect that solemn resolutions
will be passed to ban the use of D.D.T.
on the poor dear anopheles mossie and
the innocent blowfly, and await with even
greater confidence a subsequent “Kill All
Insects Week,” sponsored by country-club
golfers who have been incensed at hav-
ing a ball that was speeding straight for
the hole deliberately shouldered aside by
a mole cricket.

“Cauboy”: Can’t feel very upset at the
news that Harry Watt has asked an
American novelist to collaborate with him
on the script of the projected Eureka
Stockade picture (or one of the several
projected Eureka Stockade pictures),
though he gives as a reasqn that Australian
journalists and novelists are too slow
and discursive. Frank Dalby Davison
gave the retort courteous when he
said that cinema script - writing is
more a matter for radio script-writers
than authors of serious fiction. Tolstoy,
who took nine years to write one novel
and covered, not merely one local shindy,
but a whole period and a cross-section of
Russian society, the vast field of the
Napoleonic invasion of Russia, and the
realm of philosophy into the bargain,
would have certainly been far too slow
and discursive for the English director.
In any case, the Eureka affair, like Ned
Kelly, is a much overrated business.
There were 20,000 miners at Ballarat at
the time of the rebellion and only 150
joined the ranks of the insurgents. The
blow,, that was allegedly struck for Aus-
tralian democracy (all over in quarter
of an hour or so) was directed by a man
who would be considered a dyed-in-the-
wool conservative in these days.

“Oliver Filter”: Besides being a very
fine pilot, Blackjack Walker (B. 6/11/ ’46)
was also a very capable car-driver. His
penchant and reputation for speed kept
him under the notice, but out of the
clutches, of R.A.A.F. Service Police, who
considered their prestige considerably en-
hanced if they could ever pound their
own jalopies along fast enough to catch
him. Once, while driving from his Wing
H.Q. at Darwin to Batchelor, Walker was
chased by a more than usually tenacious
S.P. vehicle; he kept comfortably ahead
on the straight run and then, after a 40-
“They’ll all be in for a mighty shock soon. I’ve absolutely no sense of
direction.”
f
mile chase, drew away from his pursuers
on the curves and turns near Batchelor.
But, when the Assistant Provost-Marshal
read the report his men handed in, he had
no doubt about the identity of the man
they’d been chasing. They had been
unable to get close enough to read the
number plate of the offender, they said,
and, “as our vehicle was only capable
of 87 m.p.h., it was impossible to over-
take.”

“Ad Rem”: I couldn’t help laughing
at the blurb which followed an epi-
sode of the missus’s pet radio serial.
The show is sponsored by the makers of
a patent medicine, and after each
“session” a testimonial from a relieved
sufferer is read. Troubles reported range
from neuralgia to being thrown off horses,
but after a few doses of the magic potion
they all make the grade. Last night’s
true confession began: “Mr. So-and-so
of Sydney writes: ‘Not long ago, I was
hit on the head with a bottle ’ ”

“Youanmi” on the Murchison (W.A.):
At the risk of boring Westralians, I wish
to announce that Day Dawn, scene of the
recent rich gold strike, is on the Murchison
field, about 320 miles nor’-west of Kalgoorlie—
not, as the Sydney “Sunday Sun” recorded
and other dailies and newsreels seemed to think,
“a deserted ghost town on the fringe of Kal-
goorlie.” Prospectors were sniffing around the
Murchison well before Kalgoorlie was heard
of, though the distinction of being the first
field in the West went to the Kimberleys in
1886. There had been rumors before that —a
police-inspector found colors east of Northam
in 1851; “shepherds” brought in specimens in
1852-53; in 1854 a Robert Austin reported that
there was probably a large goldfield around
Mount Magnet; more specimens were found
further south in 1871-72; and in 1882 a 14-
weight slug was found at Cossack. In Sep-
tember, 1883, a party of miners obtained lOoz.
near the junction of the Elvire and Panton
rivers in the Kimberleys and, although their claim
was disputed by the unforgotten Carr B6yd, they
received £5OO from the Government for dis-
covering the West’s first goldfield. Within six
months over 400 ounces had been recovered
and the field was proclaimed in May, 1886.
Then, after discoveries of good reefs at Southern
Cross in 1887, and of rich alluvial at Pilbara in
July, 1888, the Yilgarn and Pilbara fields were
proclaimed on October 1, 1888. The Murchison
was next. Harry Woodward, Government
geologist, brought the field to notice, support-
ing Austin’s belief that there was gold in the
area. In 1890 colors were reported at Yuin
and Mulga Mulga, but not in payable quan-
tities. In August, 1891, J. F. Connolly re-
ported the discovery of alluvial, and, although
he didn’t stay to prospect it, there were goon
300-400 men on the Murchison and the field
was proclaimed on September 24, 1891. Nannine
was the first centre of the field, but Cue, which
sprang up on a find made by Cue and Fitz-
gerald, soon superseded it. Day Dawn, about
three miles south, was named after the first
claim on a line of gold-bearing country run-
ning out from Cue, and thereabouts the Great
Fingall flourished. Registered in England in
1895 as “Great Fingall Reefs” and re-registered
in 1899 as “Great Fingall Consolidated,” its
100 stamps crushed out a fortune for 17 years.
Although the Murchison hasn’t any geographi-
cal connection with Kalgoorlie, there is an
historical link. Arthur Bayley, reputed to have
recovered 1000 ounces at Nannine, tired of the
Murchison and went with John Ford to dis-
cover Coolgardie in July, 1892. From that field
went Flannigan and Hannan on a rush to
“Mount Youle” but, in June, 1893, they found
Hannan’s or “Ralgoorli” instead.

“Philp”: I know little of Queensland
and less of cricket, but my interest in
both has been whetted by a report of the
Queensland-England match in the Sydney
“Sun.” “When play was resumed,” it
stated, “more than 7000 people were pre-
sent. Many had lunch baskets, and an
envious few bottled beer.” What did the
envied majority have? Bundaberg rum?
Or have you Queenslanders some special
ambrosial nectar that makes bottled hops
only an also-ran?

“Glenelg”: If all the claims made by
family-tree-conscious Americans on be-
half of their ancestors are genuine the
Mayflower must have been the size of
the Queen Elizabeth and with that vessel’s
emergency accommodation. Even then
she must have made several trips. Al-
though South Australia cannot go back as
far as the First Families of America there
has always been strong competition for
the honor of being regarded as an “Old
Colonist.” Every year on Commemora-
tion Day, December 28, it has been the
custom of the Glenelg Council to enter-
tain at a civic luncheon old colonists who
after listening to appropriate speeches
signed the “Old Colonists’ Register.”
Last year no function was held. There
were indignant protests, and a committee
was appointed to go into the matter. A
pioneer was defined as one who arrived
in S.A. between 1836 and 1840; an old
colonist as one born in the State between
1836 and 1845. This means that the
youngest a “pioneer” could possibly be
today is 106 ; an “old colonist” 101. The
committee assumes there is none of either
category still alive. At the last few
luncheons those who signed the register
were in the early seventies —venerable
enough, but not quite the real thing.
There will be no more luncheons.

“Flathead”: The Judge had probably
seen politicians in the making before.
When a London mother accused her nine-
year-old son of “blackmail by scream-
ing,” the learned wig-wearer sentenced
him to a term in a home for observation.
Normal in all other respects, the boy
would see something he wanted, and
scream his head off until he got it. The
method in his madness was to take ad-
vantage of that peculiar streak that makes
human beings, on hearing an infant bawl-
ing, class its owners as monsters. One
interfering old person recently repri-
manded a tired young mother on a
Sydney tram for slapping her wayward
offspring. When she came to her stop, the
mother tucked the infant under her arm,
and, getting out, floored the gent, with
“Well, if you want to buy him the tram,
go ahead.”

“O. T. Cher”: Those ash-trees on Adel-
aide’s North Terrace (Ik 6/11/’46) should
look healthy. So would any other young
trees with hundreds of gallons of water
poured every week on near-by lawns.
But have a look at the same type of tree
in a suburban street where the council
has pared off about Sin. of topsoil when
levelling for footpaths and kerbs. They
look very well up till about Christmas,
but when the heat hits them they get
sick, and by late February they have
hardly a leaf left. They are moisture-
loving trees and grow in coppices in damp
bottoms in their home country. Here
they hunt water from the nearest gardens,
their roots heave up the paths, and they
grow like weeds all over the garden.

“Uco”; Adelaide Museum is to get a
silk Union Jack with an interesting
history. It was made in 1840 by soqie
“young ladies of Adelaide,” and presented
to Edward John Eyre when he left on an
expedition to the interior* Captain Sturt
made the presentation, and Governor
Gawler expressed the hope that the flag
would be “planted on the Tropic of
, Capricorn in the very centre of our island
continent.” It was never so planted, but
Eyre took it with him on his travels,
cherished it during his residence in New
Zealand and the West Indies and handed
it down to his daughter. This lady, Miss
Mary Eyre, died three years ago, and
willed the flag to her nephew, Lieut.-
Colonel A. R. G. Gordon, member for
East Down in the Parliament of Northern
Ireland. Gordon visited Australia in 1938
as a delegate of the Empire Parliamentary
Association. While in Adelaide he
showed a lively interest in the explora-
tions of his grandfather ; his gift of the
flag to the city of its origin is a sequel.

“Bondi Beachcomber”: All except one
of my fellow-passengers had satisfied the
tram inspector. The exception, a stout
lady, was very embarrassed as she
searched vainly for her ticket. “Oh, I
know! ” she said at last, “I screwed it up
and threw it away,” and she proceeded
to pick tickets from among the bumpers
on the floor. The inspector’s negative
headshakes were becoming monotonous
when at last she found one that checked
with his list. “I knew I had one,” she
announced triumphantly. Apparently as
long as people continue to throw tickets
on the floor when alighting one need
never pay a fare.

“Cungevoi”: Like “Sgt. A.’s” acquaint-
ance (B. 13/11/ ’46) I have suffered the
painful experience of being “moon-
struck.” I was camping on Stradbroke
Island (Q.), and had swung my hammock
between two pandanus palms. I ttirned
in about 9 p.m. in bright moonlight and
was soon asleep. Woke in the early
Jhours of the morning, feeling very
“wonky” in the head, and crept into the
tent. At daylight my head fejt like burst-
ing, my face was puffed up and swollen,
and my eyes watering and almost closed.
After a few days these conditions eased
up, and about the fourth day the skin
of my face peeled off and I was able to
have a shave.
“E.V.S.”: So the face of “Sgt. A/s”
moonstruck friend rose and fell with
the tide! It’s just as well for the
poor beggar that it didn’t happen in
the Bay of Fundy, where the rise and
fall is over 50 feet. Hysteria, suggestion,
lack of vitamin A, optical defect, heredity
and other factors must be eliminated be-
fore we can blame the moon, and we
want all the facts, not merely the observed
ones.

“Niloc”: I have been wrong about
Texas. As a small boy I considered my
reference library on the Lone Star State
very complete. I had formed the idea that
to live there a man had to speak in “a
soft Western drawl,” possess two very
itchy trigger-fingers, a horse of his own
and one blanket. Now lam aghast to
Jearn that Texan landlords are on strike
against rent controls. The president of
the Landlords’ Association claims that
under present rent ceilings it is impossible
to maintain their properties, -and that
landlords are better off without tenants,
who cannot be evicted, there being so
many undesirables at large. Though it
hurt me to realise that people live there
under roofs now, I was pleased to note
that the State still contained traces of the
original bad men.
BLOWING THE GAFF.
Our Cabinets sit in secret state —
That’s the tradition at any rate —
With nobody bar themselves au fait
With what they do or with what they say.
They take good care that no newshound snoops
Within sight or earshot, alert for scoops.
And every one of these powers that be
Is solemnly pledged to secrecy.
And yet how often a paragraph
Discloses someone blown the gaff!
Then there’s perturbation and blank dismay
And, as one might phrase it, the devil to pay,
And you learn from quibblers, the truth who’d
hide,
It can’t be either confirmed or denied,
A good old gag which implies, you’ll grant,
One won’t be done and the other can’t.
So what should never have been revealed
Is far and wide from the housetops pealed,
And nobody knows, though tongues may wag,
By whom the cat was let out of the bag.
And when Cabinet gathers again there must
Be dark suspicion and grim mistrust;
And many a man will his neighbor view
With the sort of look that asks “Was it you?”
Yet there’s still one secret that holds because
We’ll never be sure as to who it was,
For the hardiest soul would be loath to admit
That he had a part or a hand in it.
So, whenever Ministers plan what they’ve
Firm hopes of keeping as dark as the grave,
An item the press would be quick to use
As a red-hot feature of front-page news,
Whatever tradition it contravenes,
You can bet that someone will spill the beans.

“Clooter”: It can happen here. A
friend of mine, in search of a minor
permit of some sort, had been pushed
from one department to another, averag-
ing four interviews per department, for
two days. Getting to what he thought
was the last official in the last department,
he presented the bundle of forms which
had sprouted from the original one. The
official sat back and went meticulously
through form after form, frequently
checking back .; then he sighed, looked
kindly upon my friend and asked, “Who
sent you to me?” This question my
friend had answered a score of times al-
ready and he was sick of it. “Whatinell’s
that got to do with it?” he demanded.
Ice descended upon the official visage,
the official hands put the papers together,
the official voice said, “Go down to Mr.
So-and-so on the eighth floor and”
But the limit had been reached. My
friend sat back, gazed fixedly at the offi-
cial with as cold a glare as he could
manage, and in a deadly voice said, “Not
another step. You can call in the police,
the military, the atom-bomb brigade and
Chif. himself, but I’ll be damned if I
move one step out of this office until this
matter is fixed.” Eye held eye for a long,
pregnant minute ; then the official picked
up a pen, wrote briefly on the topmost
document and silently handed the lot
over. The permit was issued,

“O’Took”: Old Darwinites will be in-
terested to know that the Don Hotel is
in business again. However, the name is
the only thing that remains the same.
The licence has been transferred across
the road to what was once Kafcaloude’s
store and later the Shanghai cafe. The
“Have a rest when you get to the top of the

old building on the corner of Bennett-
ahd Cavenagh-streets is a deserted ruin.
It took a bad knocking about during the
war and has been left to decay. Even
were it practicable to repair the place,
the New Darwin Town Plan precludes
any possibility of its becoming relicensed,
as it stands inside the boundary of what
is defined as the Navy area. It had a racy
history, and the reputation of sporting
more color per foot of bar-space than
any other pub in Australia.

“1.D.”: “Smouge’s” par. (B. 6/11/ ’46)
doesn’t disprove the old saying that
sailors can’t swim. It does prove that
R.A.N. personnel are properly trained,
but the vast majority of merchant seamen
still can’t even dog-paddle. Most R.A.N.
recruits are unable to swim on enlisting,
but part of the course at Flinders includes
swimming the length of the baths in over-
alls. I was unlucky enough to do my
course in winter. Anyone who has been
to Westernport in July will realise that
doing the swimming test then was a good
practice for a later ducking received in
the Russian convoys. Recruits of the
present day are finding it easier—the old
sea baths have been replaced by a heated
swimming pool.

“Flathead”: Bargain-hunters are green
with envy over the bloke who recently
bought the 3000-ton Tanyo Maru for
£l2 10s.; say, a penny a ton. The Tanyo
Maru, after collecting a few in the Battle
of the Coral Sea, was beached by the
Japs near Lae airstrip in 1942. Though
he will need a team of divers, the owner
should soon retrieve his outlay from her
contents. Among the Samurai swords
and seaweed he expects to find a goodly
store of furniture, and' anticipates that
she might also be holding a fair supply
of high explosive.

“Pink Tape”: Arising out of an office
incident, a bet was made that a telephone
girl could tell what familiar numbers were
being rung up by the sound of the bell
over the line without seeing the number
dialled. The dialling was done from a list,
with the girl standing with her back to
the phone and the receiver to her ear. She
won 10-bob for her boss,’who backed her,
naming the calls being made (10 of them)'
with only one momentary error, immedi-
ately corrected. It was an interesting ex-
periment. There are differences in the rings
of telephone bells, so slight that to the
casual user they are unrecognisable, but
a constant phone attendant can sort out
her numbers with an instant recognition
of each ring.

“Frank Mauri”: During a Fortress
raid on the Meklong Bridge, Siam, a hut
in the p.-0.-w. camp near by was set
alight. With their few possessions en-
dangered, the boys scrambled out of their
slit trenches and attacked the fire. “Wire-
whiskers,” the Jap adjutant, one of the
few decent Nips in the 1.J.A., lent a will-
ing hand. The fire was under control
and the planes had gone when he noticed
that none of the Korean guards was pre-
sent. He raced off, and soon we heard
their bugler sounding the fire alarm. The
guards lost no time then. They left their
slitties and ran to the fire, “Wire-
whiskers” flogging the stragglers with his
scabbarded sword. He dismissed us and
the Koreans finished the job under a
tirade of abuse that almost started the
fire again. Afterwards he gave us a
whole bullock, saying “Prisoners very
brave men —much braver than Korean
dogs.”

“Spokeshave”: Many years before our
Department of Misinformation was in-
vented a Belgian girl born in Melbourne
visited her parents’ home-
land. She used to go
blithely into shops and
say “I come from Aus-
tralia,” but she soon gave
it up when-she found that
the Belgians were amazed
at her light color and
asked her how far back
had there been a black-
fellow in the family.
Despite his enormous ex-
penditure of time and
money, Mr. Calwell
doesn’t seem to have im-
proved the situation. A
recent issue of Nuit et
Jour, a Belgian pictorial
magazine, carries a photo,
of the attractive Rhondda
Kelly in a swim-suit
posed beside the inset of
a Myall/ abo. The cap-
tion reads; “Miss Kelly
has for ancestors these
headhunters,” It appears,
too, that Melburnians
can ski all the year round
and that footballs have
replaced boomerangs as
playthings, though boom-
erang-throwing is still the
Australian national sport. Leopold, King
of the Belgians, was better informed, al-
though he didn’t have the benefits of Mr.
Calwell’s service. When the British G6v-
ernment protested to him against the
atrocities in the Belgian Congo he re-
torted “Have you read Dr. Roth’s report
of the treatment of the Western Aus-
tralian aborigines?”

“X.S.”; In our district we have a new
policeman. The news got round that he
was a most unusual policeman who
didn’t believe in arresting people, and a
wave of lawlessness was confidently ex-
pected. Then we heard that he had acted
at a Saturday night dance in a most
peculiar manner. He had warned a young
many somewhat the worse for liquor, that
if he didn’t cease pestering the ladies he
would flog him. The nuisance refused
to desist, so the policeman took him into
the schoolhouse and gave him a good
hiding with a horsewhip. The most
aggrieved person in the district is the
town drunk, whose record of 29 arrests
for drunkenness is short by five of the
all-time record of his predecessor.

“W.P.T.”: Experiment Cottage near
Parramatta is to be sold. It seems likely
that it will be demolished, like so many
“Novo, then, that isn't in the book .”
other historic buildings in the district.
The cottage is situated on land which was
part of the grant to James Ruse, known
as Australia’s first wheatfarmer, and it
was close near by that he “grew the first
grain.” Ruse, however, did not build
Experiment Cottage. He sold his gnyit
to surgeon John Harris, who built there
about 1798 and lived in the cottage for
years. The place is in a reasonably good
state and well worth preserving as a relic
of the early days. Some years ago when
Elizabeth Farm House was in similar
danger of being sold and demolished, it
was acquired by a family interested in
Australian history and preserved.

“Fons”; I first saw —met is scarcely the
word —Lyndon Dadswell (B. 27 /11 / ’46)
one morning in August, 1940, on
board the Aquitania. It was a cold
dark morning and the ship was edg-
ing away from Woolloomooloo, with
troops jammed tight against the rails,
straining to make out familiar sights and
sounds from the uncertain shore. Our
movements, of course, were secret. But
there had been signs. A raucous “Good
on y’, Mitch,” for one of our number as
we detrained; and now car-lights, a
whole cluster of them, around Mrs. _
Macquarie’s Chair. The ship was silent,
everyone listening. Hails came across
the lane- of water. Then everyone seemed
to be shouting. The light grew clearer
and we could make out tiny figures wav-
ing things, and hear provocative snatches
of messages. Then a sergeant near me
suddenly seemed to go mad, jumping
around and pointing, clapping someone
on the back and saying something about
his wife. In a twinkling, by some means,
he had organised a kind of cheer band, a
dozen or so lusty voices who bellowed his
wife’s name in chorus. The hint was
taken. “Lin” or something like it —came
floating back across the water, ten strong.
The male chorus entered into the spirit
of the thing now, and was reinforced.
Having nothing better to do, I joined in
myself, and was a party to all kinds of
intimate messages between the Dadswells
until we were finally out of range.

“Puyyaka”: Over fifty years ago
British hygienists formulated principles
for arranging the natural lighting of
schoolrooms in the manner best calcu-
lated to prevent eye-strain. Tasmania, in
1906, was the first Australian State to
adopt these principles, and the example
was in other States when new
buildings were planned. With a newer
generation of school architects the sound
old methods seem to have been forgotten,
even in their birthplace. An exhibit at
the “Britain Can Make It” exhibition in
London purports to represent the ideal
schoolroom of the future. Every one of
the desks is lit from the right
side, and children in the rear rows are
exposed to glare from lofty windows un-
protected by shades or blinds. The only
desk which is properly arranged and
shaded is the teacher’s.

“Pasquin”: Hollywood’s worst crimes
are no longer committed by tough gang-
sters, but by kindly, middle-aged men,
and as in old-fashioned gangster films
the sympathy angle is exploited in favor
of the murderer. Take a recent film:
an innocent old fellow smashes in his
wife’s head because she nags him, and
at the end the audience feels it was most
unfortunate, but what else was there to
do with a woman like that? In another
opus, a soft-hearted chap who has reached
the homicidal age of 45 or so poisons an
interfering sister because she disrupts his
romance—the impression left is that inter-
fering sisters can be very trying at times.
Such is the power of film technique
that after Hollywood’s amateur Freuds,
super-directors and slick cameramen have
been at us for a couple of hours the idea
that perhaps in real life the murderer
would have been a weakling, with a lot
of viciousness hidden under his affability,
seems dully conventional. If this kind
of thing continues I foresee a succession
of dear old blokes, who have hitherto
led unblemished lives, pleading to the
judge that it was the bad influence of the
films that caused them to murder their
wives. And, if,the jury are filmgoers,
they’ll get away with it.

“Tom”; Occupational snobbery is a
queer thing. When I was at high school
in the early 1920’s retail employment was
held in contempt —“counter-jumping” was
our sarcastic name for it. First choice
for most who did enter the ’Varsity or
Teachers’ College was the civil service.
Failing that, an office job in a wholesale
house was favored. When I entered one
of Sydney’s foremost department stores
I met only one other ex-secondary-
school man —the staff superintendent, ap-
pointed fresh from the University. I
found that there were far more prospects
for advancement in this firm and others
like it than in a wholesaler’s office. But
it lacked the prestige, so secondary-
school boys fought shy. Not only is
occupational snobbery silly, but it has
an anti-social effect, causing people to
avoid work for which they are well
fitted because they think it will lessen
their social standing.

“Pitt St”: There are people who de-
plore change in their environment, especi-
ally dwellers in a city like Sydney, where
old known landmarks have frequently to
disappear in the name of progress;
identities, customs, traditional articles of
apparel, of food and drink, pass from the
general run of things and the city dweller,
harried enough by other irritations, has
his temper tried by new shortages or
suddenly imposed discomforts. Still,
some things remain fixed and immutable,
and with the approaching festive season
in mind it is well for the Sydney citizen
to ponder the fact that, amidst the
changes wrought by war and peace and
their attendant allies, discontent and high
taxation, one thing remains, firm and un-
shaken, carrying on in the face of threats
and promises and wide opposition—the
blackmarket.

“Primer”: Despite newspaper claims
Couzens was not the first to better Cap-
tain Barclay’s long-standing record (B.
20/11 1 ’46). That honor belongs to
William Gale, of Cardiff, who in the
’eighties covered 1500 miles in 1000
hours. Barclay was the man who intro-
duced training on a scientific basis. The
first man to benefit was Tom Cribb, who
was taken in hand by Barclay for his
second fight with Molineaux, the Ameri-
can negro. Barclay reduced Cribb’s
weight from 16st. to 13st. 61b., bringing
him into the ring a picture of health and
vitality— so much so that the black re-
fused to believe it was the same man
that had beaten him in the first fight.
Pierce Egan, who wrote first-rate accounts
of both fights, considered that Molineaux
had improved his technique since their
first meeting, and had “acquired science
equal to the champion,” but that Cribb’s
improved physical condition made him
unbeatable. The first few rounds were
torrid, but Barclay’s preparation told, and
“the Moor” was knocked out after 20
tninutes.
BRIGHTER GAMES.
The quidnuncs talk of ways to brighten cricket;
Some changes, they assert, should be allowed,
Some speeding up the game would be the ticket
To keep its spell upon the madding crowd.
They’re full of plans to get more fireworks
in it,
They sense the need for more aggressive
plays
Than scores of half a run or so a minute
Notched on long summer days.
Ah, well, in any age that’s as enlightened
As ours, few institutions are the worse
And most a lot the better for being brightened,
From modem Sundays down to modern verse.
Others, perhaps, for which the votaries queue
up
All present needs for pleasant thrills supply,
Particularly, I imagine, two-up,
Lately rechristened “zwy.”
I’m all for every well-conceived improvement
That helps to mitigate our post-war rubs;
My sympathy goes out to any movement
To brighten either politics or pubs.
And after all this cricket hokey-ppkey
I take it soon we’ll have inventive souls
Devising means to put more zip in croquet,
More ginger into bowls.
Myself, debarred from strenuous exertions
In which the sound in wind and limb engage,
Resignedly I turn to those diversions
More suited to infirmity and age.
And as my brows perplexedly are knit on
Problems where mimic hosts to combat press,
I sometimes wish that somebody would hit on
A way to brighten chess.

Railways and Defence.
“Ek Dum”; Mr. Ward, with millions
to squander and no sense of responsi-
bility, has expressed his intention of
going ahead with his £230,000,000 railway
scheme, much of it through desert
country, come hell or high' water. To
earlier adoptions has been added the
Northern Territory railway joining Alice
Springs and Birdum and linking Darwin
and Adelaide.
It is claimed that this will have the
additional advantage of giving an outlet
for Northern Territory cattle to Adelaide.
The building of the Territory railway
was a condition of the handing over of
the Territory to the Commonwealth by
South Australia, and it should have been
undertaken before the first German war.
A generation of transport development
has made a great difference to the posi-
tion. Mr. Ward would find few practi-
cal Territorians prepared to support the
scheme from an economic viewpoint at
this stage, for the reason that the Adel-
aide markets could not absorb all Terri-
tory cattle; the economic organisation
of the Territory calls for the sending
of the cattle to Queensland, where most
of the big Territory breeding stations
already have fattening stations estab-
lished.
From a defence point of view expendi-
ture on the Ward railwa3s would be a-
case of throwing money down the sink.
At the beginning of World War II
one of the greatest advantages Germany
possessed was its intensive and flexible
railway system. Within three years that
system was a liability rather than an
asset. It is not possible to put railways
and marshalling yards underground. They
are, therefore, the least defensible kind
of concentration points and the cheapest
to disorganise.
By 1944 a squadron of rocket-firing
Typhoons could be depended on to tear
up any railway bottleneck in a few
minutes. By 1946 it was nqt even neces-
sary to risk Typhoons. The experiences
of Antwerp showed that by 1947 no rail-
way bottleneck or ordinary port would,
if the war continued, be tenable against
an enemy 120 miles away with abundant
rocket-bomb equipment. Railway lines
can be ripped to pieces mile on mile in
a few minutes. Rolling stock cannot be
built to keep up with the destruction.
Road transport is reaching the same
stage. The sick bed of road transport in
large-scale war, except in regions versa-
tile in roads and cover and suitable for
quick, wide dispersions, was probably
the Mortain Gorge during the break-
through battle in Normandy.
Lines Indefensible
The long streaking lines planned by
Mr. Ward are not susceptible to defence.
They offer an enemy hundreds of points
of attack. A dozen aeroplanes at any
moment could destroy the military value
of Mr. Ward’s squandered millions.
Furthermore, since railways are more
than a pair «of rhils, they are no use
without rolling stock. The rolling stock
available for the defence of Australia
would be beyond the capacities of peace
having relation to the extent of the lines
which are to be built under Mr. Ward’s
crazy plan, which amounts to nothing
more than heaving Australia’s means of
protection on to a rubbish heap.
The Burma campaign and the attacks
on Japan from the sea were more sig-
nificant in the history of war transport
than any campaign that was fought in
Europe. These operations laid down the
direction of developments for the future.
The Essentials
The essentials of future transport in
Australian defence will be:
Swift movement, which will allow
of quick concentration of units
widely dispersed.
Equally swift movement to provide
dispersion of concentrations in the
face of threat.
Lifting power which can feed a
major battle atany point in the con-
tinent from any point in the conti-
"Yoo hoo! Breakfast!”
nent with a continuous stream of
munitions, food and men.
Railway and road transport have
already been outpaced for those purposes,
save for local and short hauls. This is
not true, of course, of civil purposes as
yet; but in war it is pace and not cost
which counts.
In the last Burma campaign virtually
the whole transport was, of sheer neces-
sity, in the air, because of the non-
existence of roads; and though the
South-east Asia Command was not
equipped with air transport as some
other commands were equipped, divisions
were moved complete with equipment
in a matter of a day or two for distances
up to 1000 miles.
The box system of fighting provided
the germ of major infiltration tactics of
the future. Large concentrations of
troops were quite content to sit down
entirely surrounded by the enemy, with-
out road or rail communication with
their own headquarters, being fed and
ammunitioned by their air forces. It was
the first time that this had been done de-
hberately on any scale in war and in
which it had been agreed to flout the old
principle of keeping land communications
open as a first necessity.
Altogether 674,000 tons of war
material were shifted along in the Burma
drive over the roughest fighting country
m the world in the last four months’
fighting. And this when the measure of
transport loads over distances beyond a
thousand miles was limited to two types
of aircraft carrying up to ten tons —the
bulk was carried in far lighter loads.
Already the United States has bombers
capable of lifting 30 tons of bombs for
much longer distances and of flying 300
miles an hour. The prototypes on the
way make it certain that the 100-ton
load would be an accomplished fact at
the end of any war which broke out now
and lasted five years.
Self-contained Divisions
Even in France, with the German Air
Force virtually wiped out, the railways
played little part in defence, since the
most modern divisions carried with them
everything from 240 m.m. guns to 250 ft.
bridges mounted on motor transport, and
with all facilities highly mechanised for
dispersion over all types of country.
Yet Mr. Ward, despite the fact that the
recent conference of all lead-
ing British commanders at
Camberley adopted and em-
phasised “flexibility” of
movement as one of the new
great principles of war, is
planhing to make the railway
the defence backbone of this
country for half a century
ahead at a capital cost which
the estimate says will be
£230,000,000, but which com-
monsense and experience
show will be £500,000,000 at
least. The graving dock at
Garden Island, Sydney, was
estimated to cost £3,000,000.
Actual cost was £10,000,000.
Australia at present should
be building, or at least plan-
ning, large-scale aerodromes
at all strategic points, with
the advances in air load of the
next 50 years in view.
For contrast in speed it
needs to be noted that the
railway trip from Adelaide to
Alice Springs takes about 2\
days ; to Darwin goods hauls
will take at least six days.
A military train will haul
about 280 men. Two air-
craft of the latest U.S. pas-
senger type could deliver a
trainload from Adelaide to
Darwin in not much more than six
hours. Ten squadrons of bombers
of the latest heavy type working
from Darwin could hit Adelaide with
4200 tons of bombs within six or seven
hours. In terms of time in the next war
Adelaide and Brisbane will be as close
to Darwin, for heavy-load bombing or
air transport, as Berlin was to London
in the last war.
In terms of rail carriage the distance
will remain at 1914 levels.

The *Mountjoys are a Westralian
family. Mountjoys have been heard
of as secretary of the Westralian branch
of the Communist party, as secretary of
a Yugoslav Communist ( market-gardeners’
association, as correspondent of the
Communist “Tribune” at Canberra and
as a crusader to the East in 1940 to plead
for a Hitler peace. It is not possible to
tell whether all these Mountjoys are one
and the same, because Communist publi-
cations ape weak on initials.
However, it is certain that none of these
Mountjoys was Donald of that ilk. Of
Donald Mountjoy Mr. Dedman said in
Parliament: “I categorically deny that
he is or ever has been a member of the
Communist party”—which might be con-
strued to mean that Mr. Dedman knows
what goes on inside the party. It is
equally certain that Donald Mountjoy
did not follow the volunteers who fol-
lowed each other into the A.1.F., there
to spend six uncomfortable years being
shot at and filled with atebrin.
Donald was a railway guard with (vide
Mr. Dedman) a keen interest in scientific
agriculture. He went into the Federal Par-
liament in 1943 as “Labor” member for
Swan, being then 36 or 37.
His record in Parliament was un-
paralleled. His speeches occupied 33
minutes in 1943 (in that year he made his
only recorded reference to agriculture),
93 minutes in 1944, 71 minutes in 1945
and 50 minutes in 1946. In 1944 he
asked two questions, in 1945 eight—four
apparently of Communist inspiration—
and two in 1946. Specimens of his
“oratory” follow:
July 20, 1944 :
The opening of the second front in Europe,
which has- been pleaded for by so many and
resisted so long, is now an accomplished fact.
... .1 am one of those who believe the second
front should have been opened earlier.
The “orator” attacked “Tory influences” in
Britain and elsewhere and spoke a panegyric
on Marshal Tito : “Armed with only the lightest
of weapons, the partisans are writing glorious
pages of history,” He condemned preference
to returned soldiers.
September 6, 1944:
Speech on Mr. Menzies’s censure motion on
the coal position; from first to last it was a
defence of the Communist party. It included
a long quotation from The Trade Unions, a
booklet by Sharkey, president of the Com-
munist party, and a long letter by Wells,
member of the Central Committee of the Com-
munist party. Sample: “The member for New
England, the Deputy-leader of the Opposition
and the member for Barker, endeavoring to
cover up the tracks of the real criminals in
connection with the coal trouble, have focussed
attention upon members of the Communist
party It is useless to blame the Communist
party for the hold-ups in industry I intend
to read to the House from ‘Common Cause’
a letter [i.e., from the Communist Central Com-
mitteeman, Wells]. I invite members to con-
trast the reasonable manner in which it is pre-
sented with the provocative speeches of mem-
bers opposite.” There was also a reference
to Mr. Lang’s “filthy yellow paper” and to
Mr. Menzies, whose “honesty of purpose” was
questioned.
September 21, 1944:
k Speech supporting the Communist leaders of
the coalminers, defending Italians in Australia,
praising the Yugoslavs of Swan and suggesting
sneeringly that, to please Mr. Menzies, the
next Budget be “printed in red, white and blue”
on a special color machine. Also a Russia-is-
always-Right outbreak: “In putting his case
the member for Deakin brushed aside the Soviet
Union as a country too poor to provide foreign
exchange. I remind the member that the war
effort of the Soviet Union has not been excelled
by any other nation,”
March 7, 1945:
„ Had the Minister for Information, Mr.
Cal well, seen “a Bulletin cartoon depicting
Mr. Churchill as Salome dancing before Premier
Stalin?” A,s “this kind of propaganda could
aid only Dr. Goebbels would the Minister take
action to prevent a continuation of it?” This
gave Mr. Calwell an opportunity to say that
The Bulletin was “undoubtedly the most
un-Australian of all newspapers published in
Australia.”
March 9, 1945:
As Opposition members believed that New
Guinea was a “side-show” would “the Minister
for the Army organise a patrol of the Oppo-
sition to visit the front line?” (He did not
suggest that he himself, a man of military age
with no military service, should accompany
the proposed expedition).
March 14, 1945:
Speech in which the 1939 Russian campaign
m Poland, as ferocious a crime as anything
in history, was extolled in Communist jargon,


OFFICIAL STATEMENT BY
SYDNEY METROPOLITAN GAS COMPANIES
The General Manager of The Australian Gas Light
Company and the Managing Director of the North
Shore Gas Company, Limited, state that the main-
tenance of normal gas supplies over the week-end
was entirely due to the efforts of volunteers from
the salaried staffs of the Companies. They further
state that the decisions of the Gas Employees’ Union
(a) to withdraw all shiftworkers from duty each sub-
sequent week-end, and (b) to place a total ban on
the working of overtime during any day of the week
constitute a direct threat to the gas supply in the
Sydney metropolitan area unless it is possible for
members of the salaried staffs to man the plants each
week-end during the period of the dispute.
The placing of a complete ban on the working of
overtime will prevent the Companies from receiving
their full supplies of coal. An endeavour has been
made to build up sufficient stocks to meet the period
when the miners will be on annual leave over Christ-
mas and New Year. This curtailment in deliveries,
as the result of the Union’s decision, will defeat the
Commonwealth Coal Commissioner’s plan in this re-
gard.
The Companies further point out that as recently
as August last, the Union’s claims, with the excep-
tion of that for a minimum industry basic wage,
were rejected by the Court (the basic wage for
industry generally is now before the Court). Not-
withstanding this, the Companies have met the Union,
at its request, since the Court’s decisions were made,
and have notified the Union that no opposition will ,
be raised to a further application by it to the'
Court in respect of increased remuneration for shift-
workers within the following limits:—
(1) The payment of an increase from 1/- to 2/-
per shift as an allowance to men on rotat-
ing shiftwork.
(2) The payment of time and a half wage rates
for all such shiftwork performed between 12
midnight Friday and 12 midnight Saturday.
Should the Court grant the above increases it
would mean an avefage addition to the wages of
shiftworkers of between 14/- and 15/- per week.

Jews, increased the distance between Ger-
many and the Soviet frontier and gained
time to strengthen its defences.” No
mention of the fact that two months after-
wards Stalin wired greetings to Ribbentrop:
“The friendship of the Russian and German
peoples is cemented by blood” —Polish blood.
March 14, 1945 :
Question about the association of Lieut.-
Colonel Reg. Powell, M.C., with the Sane
Democracy League, a body largely devoted to
the combat against Communism. Colonel
Powell, a soldier of Pozibres, had been con-
nected as an intelligence officer with the sup-
pression of the Communist party in 1940.
Followed a foul attack on the secretary
of the Sane Democracy League: “Will
the Minister ascertain whether the same Mr.
A. de Rk Barclay held an interest in what
was known as a select house of assignation,
34 Crown-street, Sydney?”
This privileged ruffianism brought a
letter from the occupier of the premises,
published in “S. M. Herald”: — 4
I protest strongly against Mr. Mountjoy’s
allegation that No. 34 Crown-street is a house
of ill-fame. He has used Parliamentary‘privi-
lege for a statement having no foundation in
truth. My wife and I have lived here for many
years as respectable and law-abiding citizens,
and hope to continue so to live in our de-
clining years. We do not know Mr. Barclay,
nor are we connected in any way with the
Sane Democracy League.
Mr. Barclay is an elderly man of un-
blemished reputation with a wife and a
young daughter. He was too old to take
it out of Mountjoy’s hide, and his son.
Captain Peter Barclay, whom thousands
of Middle East and New Guinea Diggers
still remember with admiration and affec-
tion, had been killed fighting the Japs at
Oivi. Just as well for the cowardly
Mountjoy, as Peter Barclay was quick to
avenge an insult, being a fighter from
the ground up.
The vile slander on Captain Barclay’s
father was the subject of a protest by
Mr. Harrison. To this the unspeakable
Mountjoy replied, still in Communist
parlance;
“It is not a pleasant task to me to descend
to the sewer, but the boys up North can wade
through mud and slush to defeat the Fascist
enemy, and as the Fascist enemy at home takes
refuge in the sewer, the least I can do is pursue
and destroy him there.
A more ruffianly speech was never
made in Parliament; a speech full of
Communist venom. The slanderer of an
old man brought no evidence, nor did
he attempt to produce any.
June 6, 1945;
Speech repeating Communist arguments for
“nationalisation” of the Commonwealth Bank
and attacking 8.H.P., “the Australian Krupps.”
In short, during three years in Par-
liament the fellow spoke for about four
hours, giving three hours at least to Com-
munist propaganda and abuse. For these
“services” he was paid £3OOO, plus (1946)
£1 Is. per day sitting fee, plus £270 in
postage stamps, plus free offices, free tele-
phones, a free club at Canberra and three
years’ free travel, and, in the last year, a
free private secretary at £290 p.a. What-
ever else he did outside the House was
so unsatisfactory to his constituents that
they decided one Parliamentary term of
Mountjoy was enough.
Nevertheless, the little he did was suffi-
cient for the Chifley Government,
which is dumping him on the taxpayers
at £5OO a year and perquisites in a
part-time job in which this Russia-is-
always-Right non-starter will have access
to secret defence information.
From the Elbe to Indio.
“Ek Dum”: South-eastern Europe is
just now a powder-magazine with the
most curious features.
After Mr. Churchill’s stern statement
about the strength of Russian forces in
Eastern European countries, the Russians
burst into activity fn “demobilisation.”
Their command-in-chief was trans-
ferred to Marshal Koniev, their expert in
mechanical and fast movement. News-
papermen were excluded from the Rus-
sian zone in “Western” Europe on the
ground that they would be in “danger”
during demobilisation —the Red Army
knows the propensity of its Asiatic
soldiery for rape, rapine and indiscri-
minate murder, while living off the
country on the move. Broadcasting privi-
leges were withdrawn from foreign
correspondents in Moscow. In fact a sort
of new military dictatorship was clamped
down on the country. Stalin (reported
sick again) has disappeared. Decrees are
issued by a new Cromwell, Marshal Bul-
ganin.
Meanwhile in Greece the border war
flared up along the fringes of Yugoslavia,
which has a standing army of 600,000
men, though the whole country is living
on U.N.R.R.A. It is clear that there is
a substantial invasion by bands or bodies
of Communists —who may or may not be
Greeks —from Yugoslavia, trained and
armed with the cognisance and help of
the Yugoslav Government.
The writer has been through the areas
in which the attacks are taking place.
They have been chosen because it is diffi-
cult to protect them from Greece and
easy to attack from Yugoslavia. They
are so sited that nothing and nobody
could move in force out of Yugoslavia
save with the connivance of the Yugoslav
Government,
The Turks have suddenly become
alarmed for their frontiers along the
Greek border, where, for some strange
reason, Greek guerrillas or what look like
Greek guerrillas, but may be Yugoslavs
or Bulgars or both, have gathered along
the Turkish border facing towards
the Dardanelles and Istanbul. Here the
Greek and Bulgarian frontiers come
together in the Adrianople area, where
the main routes, both road and rail, run
in from Western Europe.
From here, whether along the old
Roman road which skirts the Algean
and the Sea of Marmora through Silivri,
or by the Adrianople-Chataldja direct
route, it is an easy night’s run to Istanbul
over the old battlefields of the Balkan
War. It is mostly open country with little
timber or vegetation outside the stunted
oaks of the gullies, ideal for mechanised
transport.
At U.N.O.
Contemporaneously with the happen-
ings and behind the screen erected for
the purpose, a transfer of troops back to
Russia is taking place to keep pace with
events in the U.N.O. conference. In the
committees of that Assembly, following
Mr. Churchill’s speech, Mr. Molotov be-
came afflicted with a passion for candor
—but not for a too hurried application
of it. Time must be gained while Russian
troops are hurried out of Eastern
Europe under cover of the iron cur-
tain. At the same time, Mr. Molotov
suddenly became willing for a review of
troop numbers in all ex-enemy and other
countries.
The enthusiasm with which his pro-
posal was received and improved upon
was something of an embarrassment to
Mr. Molotov. He suddenly found himself
with a series of resolutions implemented
by U.N.O.’s Political and Security Com-
mittee —that a census of home-based, as
well as external. Allied troops be taken
by January 1, 1947, together with re-
ports on air and naval bases and their
garrisons; territories of former enemy
countries excluded.
These resolutions, of course, still have
to be ratified by the Assembly. In any
case it is an empty move, since the British
proposal that all information be checked
by U.N;O. on the spot was defeated
with Russia and the United States voting
together. Everybody concerned in the
business must have known from the
beginning and must still know that it will
come to nothing.
However, to be sure that he had plenty
of material for propaganda, aMr. Molotov
proposed that information be given as
to such weapons as atom bombs.
Since Russia is supposed as yet Jo
have no atom bomb —though it is re-
ported that battalions of fatted “Nazi
beasts” are building a factory under
privileged conditions in the isolation back
of the Black Sea this would have
worked all in favor of the U.S.S.R. It
would have had all information from
Britain, Canada and the United States
without any return obligation.
Queer Happenings in Kabul
Meanwhile affairs in Afghanistan have
been attracting attention. A few months
ago an agreement, little noticed, was
reached for the cession of a small strip of
Afghan territory on the Russian side
which virtually presented Russia with the
control of direct military routes from the
U.S.S.R. to the Khyber Pass. American
military critics are now in full cry over
a story that Field-Marshal Wavell’s visit
to London is connected with Russian
penetration towards India. Only one
Australian paper seems to have reported
it, and that belatedly.
Russia has for several years had the
largest embassy at Kabul —its staff is
even bigger than the staff at Canberra,
which is said to number 84. And Rus-
sian policy has all along been directed to
these objectives:
(1) The “freeing” of India from the
British yoke and the establishment of a
pliant babu Government.
(2) The union of Afghanistan with India,
bringing the borders of India to the Russian
border and considerably strengthening the
numbers of Moslems in the all-India union.
(3) The absorption of Persia, already
dominated and disrupted.
(4) The affiliation of the whole area‘with
the U.S.S.R., thus giving Russia an Empire
reaching from the Elbe to the Salween,
isolating Turkey and the Arab countries.
The Indian Ocean would become a Russian
sea, all communications with Australia and
the Middle East and Europe by Indian
ocean routes dominated by the Soviet
Union.
With a sympathetic base in Indonesia,
with a Communist party disrupting de-
fence in Australia, and with a Chinese
Communist army in China, Russia would
become very much the master of the
Pacific world’s policies.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Early in the second decade of the pre-
sent century Jimmy Cornell arrived in the
Westralian Parliament as a Labor M.L.C.
from the eastern goldfields. In those days
Jimmy, who had been a shearer in N. S.
Wales, was as rough as bags, but he read
avidly and cultivated acquaintances from
whom he was not too proud to learn, and
in process of time he was able to take care
of himself in any company. When the
conscription controversy arrived he sided
with Hughes, and long before the end
came to him, as it did in Perth last week,
he was Billy’s last remaining follower in
public life. In the meantime he had gone
off to the first German war, had known
what it was to be aboard a torpedoed
troopship, had become one of the pillars
of the Diggers’ League, had struck up a
friendship with Haig, who confided to
Jimmy his opinion of Petain, and had
advanced through the Chairmanship of
Committees in the Leg. Council to the
Presidency of that Chamber. He was
fated to hold it only a few months. West-
ralians have never carried political ani-
mosities into their social relations, and
there were spoken regrets from men of
all parties, as well as Diggers in the six
States and Billy—he had a great kindness
for Cornell —when Jimmy went where
the good Diggers go.
Recently arrived in Melbourne by
freighter. Lord Tovey, Admiral of the
Fleet. When vice-admiral and second in
command of the Mediterranean fleet in
1940, he had under his flag H.M.A.S.
Sydney and Perth and the Australian de-
stroyer flotilla. Lord Tovey was in com-
mand of H.M.S. Onslow at the Battle of
Jutland in the first war, and reached rear-
admiral’s rank in 1935. He was in the
Battle of Calabria in 1940 aboard Orion.
It was when he was Commander-in-
Chief, Home Fleet, that he directed the
hunt that gave Bismarck the quietus. He
was in charge of the long train of Rus-
sian convoys, and as C.-in-C. at the Nore
took a leading part in the invasion.
Travelling privately, he’s understood to
be likely to make a survey of the R.A.N.
Walter James Turner, dead in Britain
at 57, was a Melbourne-born writer and
critic who had lived in Britain since be-
fore the first German war. He pub-
lished several books of verse — The
Hunter and In Time Like Glass being
most representative of his style—but it
was as a musical and literary critic that
he was best known. From 1918 to 1940
he was music critic of the “New States-
man,” and for the first few years of that
period was also literary editor of the
“Daily Herald” and dramatic critic of
London “Mercury.” Since 1942 he had
been literary editor of the “Spectator.”
His published works included scholarly
and sympathetic studies of Beethoven
and Mozart. Turner got his musical
appreciation from his father, one-time
organist of St. Paul’s, Melbourne.
In the Middle East and in the tropical
islands, from, Papua to Dutch New
Guinea and on to Borneo, many thou-
sands of Diggers met Rex Townley, and
none of them could have been astonished
when Townley, in private life a Hobart
chemist, headed the Assembly poll for
Denison and for the State, with nearly
twice as many votes 'as were cast for
Labor Premier Cosgrove. In the Middle
East Townley was in Medical Services
with the rank of major ; in Borneo, when
the cease-fire sounded, he was Assistant
Director - General and lieut. - colonel.
Everywhere he impressed himself on Aus-
tralians thrown into association with him,
and on Tommies too, as a man with a
great heart and as straight as a die.
Townley went to the wars with strong
Labor views, being a keen admirer of
Curtin, but he changed a bit on return-
ing to his native islet and stood as an
Independent. President of the Baptist
Union in 1939, he conducts an occasional
service, and turns out now and then for
his cricket club, Kingborough, though he
has given up his first love, football.
Prior has caught here the always ami-
able and humorous features of Brigadier
Roy Meldrum (“Tommy”) Thompson,
8.G.5., Eastern Command, a familiar
and welcome figure wherever soldiers are
gathered, one of the grand band of early
Duntrooners who were a legacy to the
First A.I.F, of the halcyon pioneer days
of Bridges. He went straight into the
front line with Second Div. Artillery in
World War I, and by the time of Third
Ypres he was a captain and a seasoned
gunner with a reputation. “Tommy” was
mixed up very vitally amid the rain and
murk of mustard gas in late July, 1917,
when the fierce artillery duel round the
B.G.S. EASTERN COMMAND.
La Chapelle Canal was at its height, and
distinguished himself by a fearless
wandering round with a gun—much
sought after by the Germans —registering
targets for all Australian batteries within
reach. In the Ypres battle he won an
M.C., to which a D.S.O. was added in
the bloody business of Passchendaele in
October. He came home badly wounded
—minus an arm —but this did not stop
his soldiering. He gained his “p.s.c.” and
was at Quetta in 1936-37, went to L.H.Q.
as G 1 Operations at the outbreak of the
second war, became B.G.S. of Southern
Command and of Second Australian
Corps before going overseas to serve as
B.G.S. First Australian Corps and of
New Guinea Force. He finally came to
8.G.5., L.H.Q., where his functions were
then concerned with the first-priority
matters of training and ops. He is now
serving as 8.G.5., Eastern Command, in
one of the liveliest teams of organising
officers in the Commonwealth. Even the
delays of the post-war year have not
damped his enthusiasm.
Queensland’s latest Rhodes Scholar,
Henry Malcolm Whyte, is a young doctor
who has been lecturer in physiology at
the Queensland University since his dis-
charge from the Army a few months ago
after service with the A.A.M.C. in Borneo
and Celebes. Whyte is a son of missionary
parents —they were stationed in India
when he was born and their present field
is Samoa, Scholarships and prizes aplenty
have already come his way, but they have
been the result of the same genius for in-
dustry that urged him to work in factories
and on farms during weekends and vaca-
tions to finance his medical course. At
26 the Rhodes man has a science degree
as well as his M. 8.8.5. During his three
years at Oxford he will do post-graduate
work in clinical science.
Dora Wilson, dead in Melbourne, was
the doyen of Melbourne streetscape
painters. For many years one of the
conspicuous features of the city was the
lady sitting at her easel in Collins-,
Spring- or Swanston-street, and a retro-
spective exhibition of her paintings would
be a record of the architectural develop-
ment or decline of the great Victorian
wen over a considerable period of its
history. She was one year of age when
she came from Scotland, and she got her
art training at the National Gallery in
Melbourne. Later she spent two years in
Europe and saw her work hung in the
Paris Salon. A foundation member of
the Australian Academy of Art, there
are examples of her work in most gal-
leries in Australia.
Grace Clara Stone and Margaret
White, who graduated from the Univer-
sity of Melbourne in medicine in 1891,
the first of their sex to do it, never
caused so much surprise both to the
laity and the profession as has Sergeant
Edward Patrick Blake in passing with
credit the Nurses’ final examination. In
the Army Med. Corps at Stonington
military convalescent hospital at present,
Sergeant Blake hasn’t decided whether
he will stay in the Army or seek em-
ployment in a civilian hospital. If he
does the latter he will be the first male
nurse in Victoria. He learnt the care
of patients in the Middle East, New
Guinea, Borneo and Macassar.
The Victorian railways seem to have an
irresistible attraction for the Ford family,
of Melbourne. In 1860 Robert Grey
Ford was appointed superintendent of
the ironwork construction of the Moora-
bool viaduct, when another Ford, though
no relation, was Commissioner of Rail-
ways. In 1881 a son, also Robert Grey
Ford, joined the transportation branch in
Melbourne and ended up as s.m. at
Benalla station. His son, Donald Ford,
started in the works-and-ways branch
and ended as a railways accountant. Re-
presenting the fourth generation, Keith
Ford is now in the secretary’s office at
Spencer-street headquarters.
“Becks” on a fine journalist:
Dead in Italy at 58, Christopher Lumby,
London “Times” foreign and war correspon-
dent, whose dispatches over a period of 33
years set a standard of reporting that might
well have been followed ‘by lesser men with
bigger reputations. A Cambridge man with a
good classical background, he covered the early
stages of the Kaiser’s war, but discarded re-
porting for active soldiering and saw the war
out with the Manchester Regiment. Appointed
“Times” correspondent in Warsaw in 1919,
he recorded the tangled events of the early
years of the Polish Republic—the seizure of
Vilna, the Pilsudski regime and the Korfanty
rebellion in Upper Silesia. Assignments in
Vienna, Paris, Berlin, the Balkans and Cairo
gave him a wide knowledge of European and
Middle East affairs, and when war came in
1939 he was sent to Rotterdam. He cdvered
the invasion of Holland, escaping only at the
last minute. Back again in the Middle East,
he reported Wavell’s Libyan campaign, shared
the risks of the rearguard actions in Greece
and Crete and covered Rommel’s swoop into
Egypt. Sickness kept him out of things for
a year or so, but he was with the forces that
entered Rome. Later it was he who identified
the body of Mussolini and gave the news of
his death to the world. A losing battle against
the illness which had beset him for years ended
last month.
Continuing the run of things aboriginal
Melbourne is to have a play on abo.
problems in which one of the leading
parts will be taken by an aboriginal actor.
The play is - “Fountains Beyond,” by
George Dann, of Sydney, and it deals
with the struggles of a native community
to keep its ancestral hunting-grounds on
the verge of a N.Q. coastal town. Eric
Onus, the scholarly aboriginal who writes
eloquent letters to the dailies about his
people’s troubles, will take one of the
parts. He appeared in Army shows dur-
ing the war.
Not all the South Australian Camerons
are on the same side of the political fence
as the member for Barker. Sketched here
by Coventry, Clyde R. Cameron, new
president of the A.L.P. in S.A., is follow-
ing in the footsteps of his father as a
Labor stalwart. Cameron senior was a
shearer and a pioneer member of the
A.L.P. PRESIDENT IN S.A.
Australian Shearers’ Union, which later
merged with the A.W.U. His three sons,
including Clyde, are claimed as “gun”
shearers —shearing in Maoriland the
present A.L.P. president once notched a
tally of 278. Lately he has been secre-
tary of the S.A. branch of the A.W.U.
He’s 33.
Treading in Mohash’s footsteps is
Brigadier J. Field, co-ordinator of de-
mobilisation, Department of Post-war
Reconstruction, who has been appointed
by the State Electricity Commission assist-
ant-general-superintendent of the territory
of Yallourn. An engineer by profession,
he was a member of the faculties of
science and engineering in the University
of Tasmania, and is an associate member
of the Institute of Engineers and a
member of the American Society of
Mech. Engineers. He was in command
of the 2/12 Infantry Battalion, A.1.F.,
from October, 1939, to May, 1942, and
led it in Australia, Britain, Libya, Pales-
tine and Syria. Mentioned in dispatches
for his service in Tobruk he later won a
D.S.O. for his work with the Milne Bay
force and a C.B.E. for services on Bou-
gainville. His new empire will comprise
the opencut workings, briquette factory
and power station at Yallourn, with,a
population of 5000.
South Australian B. H. Bednall, who
returns to his native State to become
Conservator of Forests, has served in the
Forest Department of Westralia since
1924 —latterly as assistant chief. He is a
product of Saint’s and Adelaide Uni.,
where he collected his B.Sc. at the age of
20. Now 42, he has published authorita-
tive treatises on Australian forests. S.A.
plans a big expansion in forestry and
saw-milling, so there is plenty of work
ahead of the new conservator, but he is
used to that—in W.A. he was responsible
for the plans of mills with an annual out-
put of 150 million super, feet.
George Jenkins, injured in a car acci-
dent near Clare (S.A.), has been in and
out of the S.A. Assembly since 1918 and
in and out of Ministries since Henry
Barwell made him Minister for Agricul-
ture in 1922, Portfolios he’s held since
then include Public Works, Local Gov-
ernment and Marine and Crown Lands.
In Playford’s present team he is back in
his original billet as Minister for Agri-
culture, with Afforestation tacked on,
Alec Vennard’s Romance of the
Barrier Reef has been accepted for
simultaneous publication in Australia,
Britain and U.S.A. This book is the
fruition of many years’ research and
covers romantic early explorations along
the Reef and near-by coastline. Ven-
nard is known throughout Queensland as
“Bill Bowyang,” whose weekly pages
“On the Track” and “On the Top Rail”
in the North Queensland “Register”
have presented and immortalised many
bush yarns. Under the pseudonym
“Frank Reid” he wrote The Fighting
Cameliers, an account of the Imperial
Camel Corps in World War I. It’s first-
hand stuff, as Vennard, after coming out
of Gallipoli, was with the Corps from
start to finish.
Into the Silence ;
In Melbourne, John Seymour Teulon, for
20 years director of the Electrolytic Zinc Co.
of Australia and the Australian Aluminium Co.
A Boer War veteran, he served in the 1914
war and gained the Mons Star.
Dr. Ewing George Thomson, dead in Bris-
bane at 61, was Medical Officer of Health
for Bundaberg (Q.) at the time of the un-
fortunate disaster in January, 1928, when
12 children died after being inoculated against
diphtheria, and several others became gravely
ill. A Royal Commission exonerated him com-
pletely from any shadow of blame, but the sad
business affected him deeply and possibly
shortened his life.
In Brisbane, at 77, William Hooper, once a
sprinter and afterwards a water-diviner. Hooper’s
memory is perpetuated by wells and bores
throughout southern and central Queensland.
He convened the first meeting of the public
movement which resulted, in the Brisbane-
Kyogle uniform-gauge link with New South
Wales, and guided a Royal Commission over
the projected route.
In Melbourne, Mrs. Annie Small, mother of
Bruce, Frank and Ralph, directors of Allied
Bruce Small, Pty. She was an officer of the
Salvation Army for 56 years and retired with
the rank of commandant. Her husband was
Commandant William Small, who dated back
to the beginnings of the Army in Melbourne.
In Adelaide, at 75, Frank Lymer Gratton,
former supervisor of Music with the S.A.
Education Department, well known for his
conducting of the “Thousand Voices” concerts.
Yorkshire-bom, he came to Adelaide at 13,
and during 45 years as an educationist held
many posts in S.A. and The Speck.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
When Lady Dugan attended the half-
yearly meeting of the Save the Children
Fund, which was held recently in the
Assembly Hall, she stressed the appeal for
more sub-branches, and said she felt that
those people who had had training in
various types of patriotic work during the
war were the ones who should now turn
their attention to such work. In moving
the adoption of the half-yearly report,
Dr. C. N. Lee, from Singapore, said the
Fund helped to alleviate some of the
suffering caused by malnutrition.
Cheques for £2581, proceeds of the State
schools’ September appeal, and for £l2OO
from the Geelong Grammar School were
gratefully received.
When Cr. Ray Connelly gave official
welcome at the Town Hall to Professor
Bernard Heinze prior to the conductor’s
departure for a tour of Canada, he was
probably the first Lord Mayor to give his
brother-in-law a civic reception. Coun-
cillors and their wives, representatives of
the University Conservatorium, the
A.B.C. and the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra and musical societies were
guests. The reception rooms were a riot
of water-lilies, stocks and snapdragons-
On the dais with the Lord Mayor and
Prof. Heinze were Canadian Trade Com-
missioner F- W. Fraser and Mrs. Fraser,
the latter smart in tailored suit of navy
with matching hat. Mrs. Cain’s ensemble
was of pastel-blue with a small off-the-
face hat of black straw. With Mrs. J. J.
Daly was her sister, Dr. Dora McMahon,
whose natural-straw hat trimmed with
scarlet ribbon contrasted with her pastel-
blue frock. Mrs. Dermot Connelly chose
a dressmaker suit of apple-green ; a frock
of hyacinth-blue with a matching hat was
Mrs. Beatrice Campbell’s choice; Mrs.
Harold Wootton’s floral frock was simple
and neat. Leader of the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra, Bertha Jorgensen,
chose a deep parma-violet frock trimmed
with matching beads, and Mrs. O. J.
Neilsen’s brown frock was highlighted
with a yoke of saxe-blue.
Theatrelovers all over Australia will
regret the passing, at her Kew home at
the age of 84, of that grand actress Mrs.
Florence Griffiths Holt, widow of Bland
Holt. Born in Surrey, England, Mrs.
Holt came to Australia when she was 24.
In that long period during which Bland
Holt made the Australian stage live with
his full-blooded melodramas Mrs. Holt
was her husband’s leading lady. The pair
were beloved not only of those beyond
the footlights but of those behind it—-
than which no greater tribute can be
paid any actor or actress.
Members of the American Club, with
their president, Earl Moser, and Mrs.
Moser, welcomed their Ambassador arid
Mrs. R. Butler at a party in the Gloucester
room at the Australia. Mrs. Moser wore
a frock of scarlet flowers on a white
ground—a bright effect. Mrs. Butler
was beautifully outfitted in black. Mar-
garet Minert, just back from America,
wore an American model in black moss
crepe with lattice work featured on the
tiers of the slim-fitting skirt. Mrs. H. B.
Leggett’s frock of black velvet had a
fitting bodice allied to a short, full skirt
of mauve floral silk, her long gloves being
of mauve suede. Mrs. H. F. Kulken’s
frock of aqua-printed silk was worn with
a matching hat of flowers and tulle. Mrs,
O. B. Bradley wore a Chinese-red hip-
length mandarin coat over a floral frock.
Another couple being welcomed to Mel-
bourne were Mr. and Mrs. H. Q. Hill-
man, her lime-green wool-coat worn with
black and a small half-hat.
Replying to the Lord Mayor, Eire’s
new Minister, Dr. Thomas J. Kiernan,
who with his wife had just received
official welcome, said his impressions of
a country were gained not from poli-
ticians or businessmen but from the
people. He had “lounged” around Mel-
bourne and heard folk grousing at the
Government, at high taxation and other
things, and all this made him homesick
for Ireland. Mrs. Kiernan, who'ise coat
of black Indian lamb was worn with a
large halo hat, was with her husband.
Mrs. A. A. Lord, who is private
secretary to Lady Dugan, pinned in her
smart black coat her gift brooch from
the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.
Tara Barry, who also hails from Ireland
and who is now starring in “Gay Rosa-
linda,” was an attractive figure in a frock
of patterned silk worn under a light
navy coat and a small hat fashioned of
pastel flowers.
Our U.S. colony celebrated Thanksgiv-
ing Day with a dinner-dance at the Stork
Club, Black Rock. American dishes of
clam chowder, baked Virginian ham,
creamed spinach with apple fritters, turkey
with marshmallow and pumpkin pie were
served. Small old - fashioned lamps
decorated the tables, and the walls were
hung with “Old Glory.” The 200-
odd guests included many Australian
friends. Mrs. Boyce, wife of the Consul-
General for U.S.A., wore an ice-blue
gown under a black satin mandarin coat
lined with lambswool. One of the love-
liest gowns seen on the dance floor was
worn by Mrs. Seaton McDaniel, wife of
the Assistant U.S. Military Air Attache.
It was of white crepe splashed with
fuchsia and green flowers, and with it
were worn long gloves of fuchsia-toned
suede. Mrs. A. H. Hotchkiss’s black
gown had a deep neckline outlined with
crystal beads. Mrs. Armstead Lee
favored a black skirt to contrast her
green and gold lame jacket. Sophie
Graves, in aqua blue trimmed with gold
sequins, came with her sister-in-law, Mrs.
F. G. Graves, who was in old gold, and
Mrs. Ray Dunn, wearing orchid crepe
with matching orchids in her hair. Two
charming young dancers were Lucy
Branning and Martha Counts, who are
secretaries at the Military Legation.
Athol Shmith made this portrait of
Dorothea Dixon, who is well-known in
University circles. Dorothea, who is a
8.A., has for some years been active in
most of the plays produced by the
M.U.D.C. and the Tin Alley Players.
She will soon be seen in the title role in
the Tin Alley production of “Anna
Christie,” which will commence a short
season at the Union Theatre on De-
cember 14. Not only has Dorothea acted
in many of the plays, but she has been
responsible for the decor and dressing in
the shows ; she has also been behind the
scenes in many of the Uni. revues. She
put her best work into the costumes and
stage decor for “Pride and Prejudice,” in
which she played the role of Jane Bennett.
Early in the New Year Dorothea leave.'
for London, where she hopes to gain ex-
perience in stage work, decor and pro-
duction.
The clubrooms at Kooyong provided
the setting for the late-afternoon party
given by the Council of the Tennis Asso-
ciation of Victoria for inter-State tennis
players and the American Davis Cup
players. The Americans were the guests
of honor, and Kramer sported one of his
now-famous ties. Assisting president of
the association H. A. Pitt in receiving
guests was his daughter Mrs. K. Kirk-
patrick, whose black silk suit was worn
with a blue-ribboned black hat. Mrs.
Harry Hopman* was in hyacinth blue
with a small matching hat; Mrs. Gerald
Patterson in an ensemble of navy
blue. Mrs. Long (the former Thelma
Coyne) chose a gay floral frock; Mrs.
Dinny Pails was in turquoise blue with
small floral hat. Wife of former Davis
Cup player Pat O’Hara Wood was smart
in a black outfit and small hat trimmed
with pink ribbons. Peg Cowling’s mush-
room-pink frock was worn with a brown
hat and accessories. With Mervyn Wes-
ton was his wife, in a dove-grey woollen
frock and jacket and a pastbl-blue hat.
With the rain beating down on stalls
and stallholders in the garden at Grong
Grong, Toorak, Lady Dugan opened the
Raisin Fair, which was held to assist
the new branch of the University at Mil-
dura. University students worked vali-
antly all the afternoon, and Joy Youlden
shivered in a silk frock as she sold gifts
from her Christmas-tree, set in the centre
of one of the lawns. Tucked beneath a
beach umbrella, Sophie Graves, assisted
by Mary Ward, sold her wares. Helen
Wessells, director of the American In-
formation Library, presided at a well-
stocked bookstall, while Mrs. James Mc-
Dougall and Mrs. Colin McKay sold
cakes. President of the committee, Mrs.
J. D. G. Medley, tired and cold but
happy, said the afternoon would net
about seven hundred pounds.
From Sydney
Virginia Heath, a girl as pretty as her
name, and Major Michael Hawkins were
wed last week in St. Mark’s, Darling
Point. Major Hawkins, who is A.D.C. to
the Governor-General, the Duke of
Gloucester, was with the 10th Royal
Hussars (the Duke’s regiment) in the
Middle East, and was wounded while
serving in Libya. He is the son of Mr.
L. G. Hawkins, of King’s* Lynn, Norfolk,
England. Virginia’s father is Group-
Captain Noel Heath, R.A.A.F., now in
London, and her mother is Mrs. W- S.
Crossing, of Double Bay.
The wedding was society’s scintillation
of the week. Royalty attended. The
Duchess flew from Canberra, and was
at the church ceremony and the wedding
reception. Our own Governor and daugh-
ter Elizabeth, and South Australia’s
Governor, Sir Willoughby Nome, and
Lady Nome, lent vice-regal lustre. The
bride’s grandmother, the Claude Reading
lady, combined a pleased look and an
air of distinction.
There were hundreds of lookers-on
(though not, the Girl in the Flat Opposite
declares, as many as at jockey Mulley’s
wedding), who continued to exhibit
eagerness unwilted till after the exodus
of the bridal party and the wedding
guests from St. Mark’s. All the wedding
garments were super and the tailorings
the conventional morning suit and black
or grey topper. It was like watching a
crowd scene at the pictures.
The bride’s frock of pearly satin was
long and full, and its long sleeves and
train were pearl-embroidered. Her tulle
veil (lent by cousin Mrs. John Baillieu,
of Melbourne) was garlanded with orange
blossom. Three ’maids/very sweet and
cool-looking in their Puritan-like frocks
of pale green, were in attendance. Best
man was Captain A. A. Ramsay, A.D.C.
to the Duke. Babworth House, the Sam
Hordern home, was lent for the recep-
tion. The Duchess wore a broad-
brimmed brown straw hat (straight over
her brow) and a soft beige frock, plus
a glint of pearls and a discreet glitter
of diamonds. Blue in its pale tones was
worn by Mrs. Crossing with a palely
gold hat, and in its dark tones by the
Refading lady.
For the first time well-known Mel-
bourne potter Klytie Pate is giving
Sydney an opportunity of seeing her
work. The exhibition (in the Grosvenor
Galleries), which includes some exquisite
pieces of filigree and flambe work, was
opened yesterday by Ernest Turnbull.
Mrs. Pate, who is a Victorian, studied
sculpture and modelling at the Tech-
nical College. After ' completing her
six-year course Mrs. Pate was ap-
pointed to the staff of the college,
later becoming the chief pottery instruc-
tor, a position she held for some years.
The Young Contingent of the Victoria
League is holding its Christmas Fair at
Elaine, the home -of Mrs. Hubert Fairfax,
550 New South Head-road, Double Bay,
on Saturday, December 7. The Fair will
aid the Navy Fund, and will contribute
to the £5OOO (sterling) promised to the
London League, which is building a hostel
to accommodate overseas members and
students. A feature of the Fair will be
the toy stall, presided over by a naval
officer, “Father Christmas.” The 1000
toys for sale include pre-war steel trains,
dolls and modernistic steel dolls’ furni-
ture, some of which have been con-
structed by officer members of the League.
The men’s committee is organising the
sideshows, and visitors are also promised
a “peep into the future” from two
Mystery Women., Lois Graham, president
of the Young Contingent, is busily alter-
nating between the kitchen and the sewing
room, manufacturing hand-made sweets
and French flowers.
Best-dressed party of the week was the
Christmas tea drinking at Rosemont, the
Charles Lloyd Joneses’ Woollahra home.
It was bitter-sweet to a couponless woman
to see the soft silk frocks and the crisp
millinery. There was an international
touch about the guests which chimed in
with the great American date —Thanks-
giving Day. Sparkling Mrs. Derry, the
wife of America’s Consul-General, was
there; so was Mrs, Woo, wife of China’s
Consul-General. Greece was represented
by Mrs. Vrisakis, Holland by Mrs.
Zylistra and France by Madame de la
Croix. The Harry Gullett lady was there
from Melbourne with her pretty daughter,
Mrs. Robert Odell. The wife of General
Steel was another Melbourne visitor.
Lady Morshead, Mrs, Bertie Kelly, Mrs.
Nigel Smith and Mrs. E, P. Houghton
were among those exchanging the season’s
greetings. Mrs. Lloyd Jones wore a grace-
ful black frock —a Hetty Carnegie model.
No. 19 Rowe Street is a gay little shop.
Its window is filled with just the sort of
soft cuddly toy and dolls and ships and
bits of nonsense that fathers and mothers
dote on putting into the children’s Christ-
mas stockings. The tenant of the shop is
the War Widows’ Guild. Here the young
widows of Australian soldiers who fought
in the Middle East and on the Pacific war
front display the craftwork they have
been at such pains to acquire that their
oabies, too, may have a merry Christmas
and many bright and happy New Years.
Here on the red and blue shelves are the
boneless wonder dog, and saucy and
dainty dolls with modelled faces, at a very
low price considering the high cost of
dolls these post-war days. A thing of
beauty that caught the eye was a hand-
woven rug soft to the touch, all jade and
bronzy-green tonings.
The International Society drank its be-
fore-Christmas sherry on Thanksgiving
Day. This gave president Aubrey Hal-
loran the chance to invite Mrs, Florence
Taylor, who is president of the Women’s
Australian-American movement, to wel-
come the guests. Mr, Halloran kept
things moving by introducing Danish
Consul-General Fischer, R. B. Pattison
of Pan-American Airways, and George
Martin, of Cleveland, U.S.A., as speakers.
Aubrey made it of almost inter-
national significance that Cleveland
makes bicycles, and that everybody in
Copenhagen and in Cootamundra rides
one. He told the listeners that there are so
many bike-riders in Cootamundra that
people call it little Copenhagen. Knight
Ben Fuller was another speaker.
The committee of the Food for Babies
Fund pulled pff the unusual —they
repeated a success.' Following the
“Spring Frivolity” at the White
City clubhouse, they held a Christ-
mas Frivolity at the same address.
By a quarter to seven the club-
house was crowded and was blazing with
colored lights. Trails of mistletoe and
holly were features of the decorations
that extended from the doorway through
the rooms and the verandahs. It was
against this background that pretty Mrs.
C. T. Lorenz, president of the fund, re-
ceived the guests. She wore a black lace
bouffant frock on which was pinned a
posy of white and pink roses.
The buffet was in a marquee in the
grounds, but supper was eaten in the
open, the guests balancing plates of
turkey and ham, and glasses of beer as
expertly as jugglers. There was dancing
in the clubhouse, but it was on the wide
verandahs that the fun ran high. Here,
directing the wheels of fortune, were
A. G. Callinan, John Goodall, Colyn Mc-
Eachern and Dr. de Basto, while George
McGilvray dashed about answering SOS
signals from every direction. At 9.30
Santa made royal entrance in a gorgeous
chariot drawn by two Christmas fairies.
Tomorrow at eight o’clock the Con.
will be gala. Occasion is the tribute to
singing teacher Nevill Smith by his
students. Many of these are now concert
and radio singers. Among well-known
names on the programme are those of
Rosina Raisbeck, Don Grahame and
Ronald Jackson.
Just as Santa Claus was busy digging
himself into the ice palace provided for
him by Anthony Horderns’ in the Fine Axt
Gallery at the top of the building women
members of the English Speaking Union
were singing Christmas carols.- That is
the true festival spirit. The music circle
of the E.S.U., its friends and admirers,
all dressed up in summer raiment to
greet the bright day, were in their places
at half-past two. First there was a pro-
gramme of all-the-year-round lyrics and
operatic arias by Joy Soiling—she in-
cluded two Australian songs in her group
—Pamela Marks and Noel Melvin. Mrs.
Harry Twigden, president of the group,
was hostess-in-chief.
Y.W. staged quite a good party in Wini-
fred Taylor’s honor last week. There
were over one hundred guests and the
cakes were a pre-war dream. Winifred
has been for 4\ years Educational Super-
visor to Sydney Y.W. Classes when she
started numbered six; now there are 54,
dressmaking, millinery, floral art and
such. The choir, the Musical Apprecia-
tion classes and the Recorded Music
Club owe much to the enthusiasm of
Miss Taylor and Mrs. Hope Gibson.
President Mrs. C. P. Johnson, the Butters
lady and Mrs. Hope Gibson were the
hostesses.

In Maoriland the political party in
power has been bitten by the socialistic
bug of Government-owned-and-controlled
everything. Now it has switched the
nationalisation spotlight on to insurance.
So the question arises whether the
country would be better or worse off if
its big fire, marine and accident offices,
which have world-wide connections like
this N.Z. co., passed from private to
Government ownership.
The “Wild Cat” believes that commer-
cially and financially the country would
be worse off. The Government case for
nationalisation of insurance, not yet pre-
sented in specific form, must pass two
tests, technical and financial. Techni-
cally the Government is bound to act on
lines similar to private enterprise left to
itself. So nothing is to be gained, though
much might be lost, by civil-service
planning on that plane. On the important
question of service, evidence in other
fields in the Dominion shows that, judged
by the more advanced standards of com-
mercial practice, substitution of Gov-
ernment monopoly for wholesome private
competition is a retrogression.
Financially the country would be a
heavy loser. This N.Z. cb. is a handsome
contributor to the Dominion’s invisible
balance of payments, because of its large
foreign business. Much, if not all, of
this business could be expected to evapor-
ate under Government ownership. It is
eminently reasonable to suppose that both
Government and private enterprise in any
country would look askance at services
offered in competition with its own
nationals by a foreign Government,
whether for profit or other purposes.
Thus the national income of the
Dominion would suffer in both nature
and volume. To merely choke the
economy with the weeds of theory, which
if they do not make a desert would pro-
vide the manure for it, smacks of Alice
in Planningland.
About a fifth of the co.’s business is
admitted to lie in Maoriland. Something
of the geographic spread of the other
four-fifths is apparent from the following
dissection of Government and municipal
security holdings:
May, 1946.

South Africa .. .. .. 85,364

(J.S.A. and Canada .. .. 1,004,189
Argentina .. .. .. 295,184
Others 10,262
£4,747,666
Notwithstanding that the branches in and
around East Asia fell into enemy hands,
war brought the co. more business than
ever. This mainly from marine risks at
very high rates while the submarine and
air menace was at its peak. These
risks originated largely in U.S.A., U.K.
and Argentina. Nearly the whole of
the rapidly-expanded American mercan-
tile marine was insured in the open
market, and the British Ministries of
Food and Supply placed large contracts
covering the bulk of their imports with
commercial underwriters.
The sudden shrinkage of business on
war account and sharp reduction in
marine rates have been offset by revival
of commercial activities, including the
operations of U.N.R.R.A., improvement
in the volume of merchant tonnage avail-
able, and the gathering stream of fire,
motor-vehicle and other business:

Last term an extra £50,701 of net
premiums was gathered at £78,698 less
cost. Although claims were £70,113
heavier, the underwriting surplus stepped
up £79,286, reaching £268,553, equal to
17.9 p.c. on capital. Interest and rents
turned in £175,591 net (up £3587). In-
cluding an unexplained addition of
£14,285 to the investment and contin-
gencies reserve, net return from all
sources was £458,529 (up £61,729), or
30.6 p.c. on capital, compared with 26.4,
36.1, 40.1, 27.6, 26.1 and 23.1 p.c. back
to 1940. That includes additions (£43,000
last term) to the reserve for unexpired
risks, now £1,308,000, or 54.5 p.c. of the
year’s net premiums’, whereas 40 p.c. is
usually considered sufficient.
The div. was kept at 12} p.c., more
being put by than was distributed, lift-
ing the pile of reserves over two-and-a-
half times higher than paid capital. Al-
though some recession in net earnings
can be expeeted, there is nothing to sug-
gest that the 12} p.c. is likely to be
interfered with.

ceptionally strong position:

Ordinary shareholders in this big and
fashionable department store on Nov. 6
received 100,000 f.-p. shares, 10 for 81.
It was not a bonus issue in the ordinary
sense of the term, inasmuch as it was not
a capitalisation of surplus earnings, but
of money previously put up by share-
holders in the form of share premiums.
At the current market price of 435. (offi-
cial high), the gift represents a capital gain
of £2l ss. for every 81 shares held, and
makes a 10 p.c. div. worth 11.2 p.c.
The wisdom of issuing shares at a
premium is open to question, because it
creates a position which lends itself to
easy misrepresentation by socialists and
Communists. It tends to make a business
look more prosperous than it really is.
The greater the share premium the more
nominal is the declared rate of dividend,
which becomes an exaggerated statement
of the actual return to shareholders. For
instance, on a 10 p.c. div. basis the
actual return on shares issued at a
premium of 50 p.c. (as in this case) is
6.6 p.c. A shareholder is entitled to a
fair return on his money, whether part
of it is called share premium or not.
The co. has three stores, one each in
Elizabeth-, George- and Market-gtreets.
Part of the Market-street premises, taken
over by the Department of Munitions
during the war, reverted to the co. last
term, and a subway to the diagonally
opposite Elizabeth-street premises is to
be constructed at an early date. The
clothing factories at Marl borough-street
(Sydney), Katoomba, Cessnock and Kurri
Kurri —the spread is a reminder of the
labor problem turned out over
£1,000,000-worth of goods last term, and
are claimed to be the largest manufac-
turing organisation in the Australian soft-
goods trade. A subsidiary, the Selby
Shoe Co., which recently absorbed the
Cleveland Shoe Co., puts out about
200,000 pairs of footwear annually.
The spring in the year’s record turn-
over was 27 p.c. Sales were bumped up
by the heavy demand from demobilised
service personnel, and the rest of the
public, partly starved of goods for the last
half-dozen years and with plenty of
money in its pocket, was, and still is,
eager to buy. Much of the spending,
however, has been on non-rationed goods
in the luxury and semi-luxury classes ; a
reminder of the urgent need to stimulate
production and abolish rationing of
essential clothing lines.
Exes, advanced only 17 p.c. After
allowing “about three times the amount
paid to shareholders in divs.” for taxa-
tion, £52,829 (up £8297) for depreciation
and sending £70,000 (up £12,787) to the
staff fund —there are 6000 names on the
payroll—the leap in net earnings was
£43,701. The £207,630 of profit, best in
the co.’s history, covered pref. require-
ments and 22.2 p.c. on ord. capital (19.7
p.c. on ord. capital as it now stands), as
against 16.8, 16.3, 16.2, 14.9 and 12.7 p.c.
back to 1941. The div., kept at 10 p.c.,
was sweetened with the gift issue already
referred to. Capital has the support and
assistance of an almost equal amount of
reserves.
Finances are in good trim:

The recovery last term was due to re-
vival of building and strengthening of the
labor force, following demobilisation.
The next table, showing average monthly
value of private building permits issued
by Local Government authorities in the
Victorian metropolis, explains the wide
fluctuation in the co.’s profits since 1939:

For the three months to end August last
the average exceeded the million-pound
mark, and would have been greater but
for the coal shortage and industrial hold-
ups, which interrupted the output and
smooth delivery of essential building
materials.
In addition to bricks the co. turns out
stoneware, sanitaryware and other

After allowing an extra £5733 for taxa-
tion (£6310) and something for deprecia-
tion, the year’s profit was £3809 better at
£12,014, equal to 6.2 p.c. on capital as
against 4.2 p.c. for the preceding term.
The div. advanced from 3} p.c. to 5 p.c.,
making the average over the last seven
years 3.5 p.c.
After World War I divs, averaged
10.8 p.c., sweetened with a 20 p.c. bonus-
scrip issue in 1923, for the boom decade
to the close of accounts in 1930. But
this patch of history is not likely to re-
peat itself. This time taxation is much
higher, with little prospect of early relief,
costs are high and still on the up-grade,
materials and prices are controlled, and
competition is much keener, which means
that the co. with the lowest costs is going
to fare best. Recognising this, the board
proposes to further mechanise plant.
Some improvement on last term’s earn-
ings and distribution can be expected,

Westralian Under-secretary for' Mines
Telfer told the Qrants Commission in
Perth the other day that £1,000,000 would
be expended on plant and equipment
before Australian Iron and Steel’s iron-
ore venture at Yampi Sound reached the
producing stage. This expenditure, he
said, did not include cost of a fleet of
steamers to transport the ore to Kembla
and Newcastle (N.S.W.) for smelting.
Telfer added, pity was that the ore was
not to be smelted in the West.
Freney Oil Co. (W.A.) has got its wish
—further Federal and State Government
financial assistance to complete the bore
at Nerrima, 200 miles south-east of
Broome. Co. finds £BOOO and gets
£30,000, and the Commonwealth also
provides £5OOO to put the plant at the
bore site in order. Boring ceased when
the Japs bombed Broome, and the plant
was hurriedly dismantled and buried in
the bush. It is now 25 years since Freney
began its search for oil. Results so far
have been confined to occasional men-
tion of favorable indications.

Bega Mines, N.L., an Adelaide concern
with a paid capital of £10,300 in ss.
shares paid to 25., has taken a working
option over the Red Ned and Blue Moon
East mines near Tennant’s Creek
(N.T.). At the Red Ned, on the Mt.
Samuel-Hammerjack line of lode, 386
tons ore recently yielded 3640 z, gold
over the plates. Here the option is for
18 months, and the price £6OOO, plus
5000 contribs. in the co., which is entitled
to half of any gold won during develop-
ment. There is no record of output at
Blue Moon East, a 20-acre block adjoin-
ing the Blue Moon, which has crushed
3288 tons for 12,0740 z. gold over the
plates. Here the price is 5000 contribs.
in the co., payable at the end of six
months. It is a patchy field, which has
so far revealed no large well-defined reefs.
The gold occurrences are related to in-
jections of quartz and ironstone, and in
the oxidised zone the enrichments are of
secondary origin and associated with
small quantities of bismuth.

Lack of transport and difficulty in
obtaining supplies and equipment are
holding up revival of goldmining activity
on Cape York Peninsula (N.Q.). At Coen,
Fisher and Sons have hauled 20 tons of
equipment from Portland Roads pre-
parity to reopening the Great Northern.
W. Bryant is prospecting the Lankelly
Creek alluvial workings, where he is fol-
lowing a small leader into the bank, and
“Friday” Wilson is preparing to sluice
about 15 tons of wash on the near-by
Eastbank claim.

Perth’s latest gold whoop is about a
rich patch of ore taken from the Moun-
tain View mine. Day Dawn, near Cue,
on the Murchison field. Value of six
tons is estimated at £245,000 by Sydney
evening and at about £BO,OOO by the
morning papers. The latter figure will
probably be found nearer, possibly
well above, the mark. Mountain View
workings are close to those of the aban-
doned Gt. Fingall mine, which for a
time ranked among the best of Wes-
tralia’s gold producers, and was the big-
gest quartz show ever worked there.
Several rich strikes have been made in
Mountain View during the last few years.
A recent crushing of 938 tons yielded
4000 oz. of gold, and another 1000 tons,
now ready for milling, is expected to
return BOOOoz. There have been many
rich patches struck on the Murchison
during the past 50 years; some at Lake
Austin, some at Cue, some at Nannine,
some at Boogardie, and some elsewhere.
Long ago boxes of specimens from
a show on the Murchison field were
exhibited in London, and the shares of
a co. floated there to work the show from
whence the samples came rose to a high
premium. But the market slumped
heavily when, in reply to an order from
the board to buy a battery and start
crushing, the manager cabled “Send back
the reef.” ,

A recent application by De Bernales
Westralian Group for six months’ ex-
emption frbm labor conditions on a
number of goldmining areas was not well
received by the Kalgoorlie Warden. In
one case he said that, although for years
excuses had been accepted for not work-
ing the property, he thought that it was
time something was done, or someone
else allowed to step in. He gave the
Group three months to decide whether to
work the show in question or get out.
The same applied to most of the other
areas concerned.

“O.B.”: Chairman of Hampton Gold

that, although the co.’s areas at Hampton,
Plains (W.A.) would be fraught with
uncertainty for a considerable time, it
was evident that the holdings were the
basis of a new field, which should in
time become a powerful influence in
Westralian gold production. Some min-
ing men on the spot think differently
about the prospects of this area.
LIVING STANDARDS
JEOPARDISED
Better Value for Money
Needed
Says National Bank Chairman
Addressing the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the National Bank of
Australasia Limited, held in Melbourne on Wednesday, 27th November, the
Chairman, Mr. H. D. Giddy, said: “Already our brief post-war experience
has made it abundantly clear that though we may know how to keep monetary
incomes at a high level we are far from knowing how to sustain the real value
of these incomes, let alone increase it. Monetary management may be able
to produce the incomes, but it cannot, of itself, produce the things which we
want to spend them on. After all, the individual would be no further forward
if his present income were doubled and he had to pay twice as much for
everything he bought. What he wants is better value for the mloney he spends,
be it on the routine daily needs or those other goods and services which make
for comfort of life and happiness of a home. Real progress in a social sense
surely means that more and more people are able to enjoy more and more
of such things as better-class homes and domestic equipment, better-class
education, better quality of clothing, first-class transport services and holiday
accommodation, and a host of other things which go to make up a full
life. It is a bleak outlook indeed if we are to be for ever battling to maintain
minimum standards of existence, which would seem to be the limit aimed at
by some social theorists.”
Mr. Giddy said he believed that the
shortage of commodities sought by the
people was one of the greatest destroyers
of incentive to work. “The great majority
of people,” he said, “are really not in-
terested in working to earn money merely
to save for the future. They work with
the object of being able to spend money
on their desires from week to week and
month to month. So it is quite under-;
standable that men and women decline to
exercise their full energy, when their
labours do not bring them the goods and
services they reasonably look for. Indeed,”
said Mr. Giddy, “I go so far as to suggest
that in the shortages of goods at reason-
able prices upon whichr wage- and salary-
earners can spend their incomes lies the
cause of much of our present unfortunate
industrial strife.”
WISHFUL THINKING USELESS.
Mr. Giddy said that greater all-round
production on a more willing and more
efficient, and therefore cheaper, basis is
the paramount need. He expressed his
conviction that increased production and
effective distribution are the keys to im-
proved living standards, and that at the
same time they supply the answer to the
fears of inflation. “I do hope that as a
nation we will stop this philandering with
ideologies and really get back to work,”
said Mr. Giddy. "Social thinking and fanci-
ful monetary schemes get us nowhere. The
wisdom of Professor D. H. Robertson’s
telling words must surely be apparent to
all: ‘The mending of the road over which
the produce passes to market is no sub-
stitute for the digging and dunging of the
fields themselves.*
“Standards of life are largely dependent
on the amount of surplus income left to
individuals after paying for the bare
necessities, but the present policy of
fierce taxation, particularly on personal
earnings, severely reduces, indeed, often
eliminates, the surplus income of most
people.
“Further, the real value of the indi-
vidual’s income is more depressingly low
by reason of the limited supply of goods
and services and the high prices of those
he can obtain. The combination of these
factors is a drag on incentive, and without
doubt is reducing the standards of the
whole community. It is a vicious circle
winding ever downwards, and until it is
broken it is idle to talk or even dream of
improved living standards.”
ADVANCES INCREASING AGAIN.
Mr. Giddy said that, judging by the ex-
perience of his Bank, the heavy decline in
the public demand for trading-bank loans
showed signs of being arrested as far back
as 1944. However, on average, trading-
bank advances had remained low for some
months after the end of the war, and it
was not until the first quarter of this year
that a real turn in the tide became
apparent. “It is understandable,” he said,
“that some time should elapse before the
need for bank accommodation became
manifest, as no doubt industry was fully
occupied with the immediate problems of
tailing off war production and making
preparations for resumption of peace-time
activities. As this preliminary period
passed, a marked upward trend in ad-
vances set in.”
Mr. Giddy said this strong upward
movement was only to be expected as re-
conversion of industry to peace-time
activity took place and as the way was
opened up for a return to peace-time pur-
suits by individuals. He said the post-war
period should be characterised by de-
clining Government expenditure and rising
private investment and spending. “There
is reason to believe,” said Mr. Giddy, “that
lending by the Banking System for indus-
trial and commercial purposes or to
finance useful activities by individuals is,
in the long run, less inflationary than
lending to support an unwarranted high
level of Government expenditure. Both
forms of lending tend to expand deposits
and currency to much the same extent,
but the vital difference is that loans to
private industry and individuals are
accompanied by production of the goods
and services so urgently wanted, whereas
much of the spending by Governments
does not bring this desirable result.”
Outlining recent trends in loans made
by the Bank, Mr. Giddy said that compared
with other sections the demands for loans
to manufacturing industries had been ex-
tremely heavy. Reconversion meant a
much greater rearrangement in these in-
dustries than in a number of other sec-
tions, owing to the heavy proportion of
plant and machinery involved, but the
borrowing demands of manufacturers
were such as to also indicate a determine
tion on their part to enlarge substantially
the scope of their activities. An appreci-
able rise in the amount of loans to com-
mercial undertakings had also been re-
corded over the past year. Here, the
average loan per borrower, though on the
increase, was still far below the normal
peace-time figure, owing, no doubt, to
the inability, as yet, of traders to build
up stocks to usual levels.
The expansion in lending to the primary
industries had been somewhat smaller than
in other important categories, though the
average loan per borrower, particularly
in the pastoral, dairying and farmyard
groups, was now well above usual pre-war
levels.
POWER OF AUTHORITIES SHOWN.
Discussing recent decreases in bank
deposits, Mr. Giddy said: “At first glance
this movement is surprising, as it coin-
cided with a sharp upswing in trading-
bank advances and with a sustained in-
crease in overseas funds. The explanation
of the decrease in deposits, more marked
in the trading-bank section than with
savings-bank deposits, is to be found in
an appreciable reduction in the volume
of \ investment in Government securities
by the Central Bank and the trading
banks, and this contraction has more than
offset the expected expansionary influence
of rising advances and higher overseas
balances. As, in recent months, there has
been a marked decrease in treasury bills
outstanding, it would appear that the
Commonwealth Government has been
accumulating funds in excess of its ex-
penditure, though unfortunately the
amount cannot be determined by refer-
ence to the monthly statements of revenue
and expenditure, which are limited in
their scope.
This recent experience, however, pro-
vides a striking illustration of the power
which the controlling authorities—the
Federal Treasury and the Commonwealth
Bank—now exert toward varying the
volume of credit. In pre-war days, such
movements were largely ascribed to fluc-
tuations in London funds ; now it is quite
clear that' movements in overseas balances
and the other influences which formerly
affected the volume of bank deposits and
currency can be drowned at will by in-
ternal action on the part of the controlling
authorities. The exercise of this vast
power in the interests of monetary sta-
bility calls for the greatest care and skill.”
BANK’S ACTIVITIES EXPANDED,
Mr.' Giddy said that the growing volume
of business had necessitated strengthening
the Bank’s administration, and that, in
the effort to improve and widen its ser-
vices, a number of old departments had
been expanded and new departments
established. Mr. S. M. Wreford had been
appointed to the new position of Senior
Chief Inspector of the Bank, and Mr. H. R.
Mackenzie had become the Bank’s Chief
Inspector. Mr. J. D. F. Grant had been
appointed Manager, London Office, and
Mr. G. C. Hill Sub-manager. Mr. R. E.
Ash had taken charge in Western Aus-
tralia, and Mr. J. L. Nave in Sydney Office.
The Economics Section, under Mr. G.
R. Mountain, M.A., had been considerably
developed, and a new Public Relations De-
partment established under the manage-
ment of Mr. R. C. Grover, B.Com. As a
first step to making public much of the
authoritative information on industry and
commerce which is constantly accumu-
lated by a large bank this Department
has commenced the re-issue of the Monthly
Summary of Australian Conditions. Means
are being explored whereby other valu-
able information, not suitable for inclu-
sion, in a regular publication, can be
distributed, and this Department is being
developed to provide the Bank’s customers,
and any others who so wish, with a wide
range of information on business trends.

SIMDRU SJPWS
AT THE TALKIES.
War Problems
Lillian Heilman’s play, “The Searching
Wind,” filmed by* Paramount and showing
at Sydney Prince Edward, is a discursive
and occasionally dramatic elaboration of
what Kipling said simply and effectively
in two lines:
If any question why we died,
Tell them, because our fathers lied.
Miss Hfllman pins the blame for the war
on diplomacy in general, using for illus-
tration an American diplomat in Europe
who sees the rise of Fascism and Nazism
and does nothing about it. What he is
expected to do the author does not make
very clear, except, perhaps, to suggest that
he should have urged his Government
to talk and act tough in Europe.
Whatever the merits of its case, the
film is well-acted and presented, and
Robert Young plays the diplomat effec-
tively enough for the purpose of the
argument. He falls in love with a young
woman newspaper correspondent (Sylvia
Sidney)—who, of course, knows every-
thing that is wrong with Europe and what
should be done about it —but, because
of a clash of ideals or something, marries
instead a vacuous young socialite (well
portrayed by Australian Ann Richards),
who gives him more trouble than assist-
ance in succeeding years. Throughout
the film a tenuous love affair with the
correspondent is maintained, she urging
Mr. Young to hop in and run interna-
tional affairs to her liking.
The end of the film finds the two
women, the man and his son, who has
just lost a leg fighting in Europe, discuss-
ing the past 20 years. The young man is
very bitter about the part his parents
have played in building up a war for
him, and is certain that he and his fellow-
soldiers will never let the same thing
happen to the world again. Unfortunately
for Miss Heilman’s argument, after the
1914-18 war the world was full of similar
disillusioned young men who swore that
they would never let it happen again.
War problems of a more personal kind
are discussed in “Young Widow” (Sydney
Mayfair) and “Till the End of Time”
(Sydney Century). The former is a super-
ficial and sentimental examination of the
problems of a young woman (Jane
Russell) whose feelings for her airman
husband lost over Europe are suddenly
interrupted by the appearance of another
thoughtful and considerate young airman
(Louis Hayward); the latter concerns the
rehabilitation of three ex-servicemen,
one legless (Bill Williams), one with
half his skull replaced by a silver plate
(Robert Mitchum) and the other (Guy
Madison) suffering from nothing worse
than a bad attack of restlessness. Their
troubles are sorted out along with those
of a young war widow, played with some
intelligence by Dorothy McGuire.
Murder, Etc.
Based on a Hemingway short-story and
produced by Mark Hellinger, “The
Killers” (Sydney State) opens with
15 minutes of high tension as a
couple of professional killers drift into
a small country town and, apparently
without reason, dispose of a young
mechanic at the local garage. The trail
is picked up by a claims investigator of
an insurance company who unravels the
story of the murdered man in a series of
flashbacks remarkably like the method
used by Orson Welles in “Citizen Kane.”
Except for a slight sag in the middle, the
story is as tight aS a drum all the way, and
handled with easy competence by a string
of good players, including Edmond
O’Brien, Albert Dekker, Sam Levene,
newcomer Burt Lancaster and Ava
Gardner.
“Pink String and Sealing Wax” (Sydney
Embassy) is another and less successful
murder opus. The son of a chemist in
the ’nineties rebels against his father’s
domestic tyranny and becomes involved
with the local pub-keeper’s wife, who is
carrying on with one of the customers.
The chemist’s son unwittingly supplies her
with strychnine, which is all she needs to
set herself up as a wealthy widow. In
the original play the chemist was the
central character; in the film the interest
has been shifted*to the murderess and the
change is not successful, even though
Googie Withers makes a good study of
the sullen, gipsy-like wench.
The murder in “The Black Angel”
(Sydney Victory) is less spectacular than
other current mayhem, but the trail that
leads to it is no less involved. The faith-
less spouse of a song-writer is strangled
in her apartment and the trail leads to
a young man who was being black-
mailed by the lady. He is arrested, tried
and condemned and then saved with
about 0.025 of a second to spare by his
wife and the composer, Dan Duryea as
the composer, detective Broderick Craw-
ford and Peter Lorre as a night-club
owner keep the piece on its feet, despite
a couple of very high red herrings that
are dragged very slowly across the trail.
Ghosts and Pixies
Best of a current outbreak of ghosts,
pixies and sundry other supernatural
phenomena is “The Cockeyed Miracle”
(Sydney Liberty). Frank Morgan, an
ageing and moderately respectable ship-
builder, passes peacefully over the line
to be joined by the ghost of his father
(Keenan Wynn), a rakish young blade
who was launched into eternity at the age
of 37 by having a bottle of whisky broken
over his forehead in a bar-room brawl.
The pair of them linger around their
earthly haunts long enough to tidy up
Morgan’s muddled affairs.
In “Three Wise Fools” (Sydney St.
James), hanker Edward Arnold, doctor
Lionel Barrymore and lawyer Lewis Stone
have the tranquillity of their palatial
bachelor home shattered by the arrival of
an Irish orphan (Margaret O’Brien) and
her retainer (Thomas Mitchell), and their
stony hearts melted by her belief in pixies,
curses, witches and whatnot. It should
appeal to anyone who has been bitten by
a bunyipV
“The Hoodlum Saint” (Sydney Capitol)
is another supernatural piece in which a
rising financier (William Powell) jocularly
consigns his erstwhile comrades to the
care of Spnt Dismas and then, after the
crash of 1929, is driven to invoke similar
assistance for himself. On the evidence
of this —and of “Yolanda and the Thief”
and “The Bells of Saint Mary’s”—the
churches know better than Hollywood
how to handle “the great ideas committed
to their charge.”
“Do You Love Me?” (Sydney Plaza)—
Good Heavens, no! While Maureen
O’Hara looks very pretty in technicolor
and Reginald Gardiner puts in a spot of
good acting, Harry James and Dick
Haymes spend the length of the film mak-
ing an infernal din at the base angles of
the eternal triangle, dribbling each time
they sight Miss O’Hara.-
"Atomic Blondes."
“Atomic Blondes,” Sydney Tiv.’s
.latest, has the usual ingredients of legs,
color, dexterity and laughs. Jan Rubini
plays popular airs, the La Salles’ skating
act is above the average, and the Apple-
tons, an adagio trio, throw themselves
and two attractive girls around the stage
at a furious rate. C. Ray Smith makes
skilful play with puppets, Clifford and
Marion exploit Original comedy material
well, and Bargo and Dare handle a stock-
whip with spectacular recklessness. Other
personalities are a Chinese singer, Chung
Doo, and “The Old Belles,” erstwhile
revue stars, who open the programme
with a songandance act.
Artbursts.
Lionel Lindsay
Tinted drawings, mezzotints, etchings
and woodcuts by Lionel Lindsay, bn
show at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney,
have a high standard of technical crafts-
manship. But among scenes from Granada
to Capri it is too often the superficially
picturesque aspect which is presented—
as though in painting, say, Scotland one
ignored the Highlands and grim castles
and concentrated on pretty crofters’ cot-
tages with roses round the door, consider-
ing them with the rosy vision of a tourist
and not with the eye of a native-born
Burns.
The artist does not, in strict fact, ignore
the castles. He has a fondness for them.
But he has a tendency to put metaphori-
cal roses round their battlements.
The etching “Great Door, Burgos,” with
its wealth of detail, commands respect
by sheer weight of design. “Palace
Benares,” built to a similar scheme, fails.
It has obvious flaws—such as a “scratchy”
surface of water—and obvious merits,
but the final effect is that, lacking drama
and poetry, it remains unreal. For all
its fine line of towers and formidable
balance of light and shadow it is hard to
believe in it. It is equally hard, on in-
spection, to believe in the few Australian
scenes, for all their obvious fidelity.
“Outside the Walls, Avila,” a tinted
drawing with tiger patterns on a rough
hillside and cattle scattered along a bend-
ing road, gains a certain vicarious
strength from the subject—a refreshing
roughness.
Etchings
The Royal Art Society, Sydney, has an
interesting exhibition of etchings by
Malcolm Osborne, Martin Hardie, Syd-
ney Long and Squire Morgan in the
society’s gallery. “City Wads, Avignon,”
and “Avignon” are two of thb best speci-
mens of Osborne’s work in the show,
both giving a fine impression of spacious-
ness and white light. Martin Hardie’s
“Sunset in Scotland” is a strong state-
ment —a black silhouette of a house stark
against an alternating light and darken-
ing sky—and the pick of that artist’s ex-
hibited wares. Sydney Long’s “Street in
Alexandria” has the invaluable advantage
that it is an Alexandrian street —soft-
toned, it is at once shabby and myster-
ious. For the rest. Long’s hard and pre-
cise detail, dwelling overmuch on the dry
bones of a subject, lacks realism. An in-
teresting contrast is his “The Edge of
the Lake,” hanging beside Squire
Morgan’s “The Lake Avoca.” Shadows
on the water in the first work are simple
strokes across and down, with a wriggle
to indicate a ribbon of light, and the trees
are too obviously patterns of well-
executed lines; “The Lake Avoca” has
the shape and shadow of the tree softly
blending.
Graham Moore
Mr. Moore (Velasquez Galleries) is a
newcomer to exhibited art in Melbourne.
He is obviously a trier, likes simple sub-
jects and paints a young farmer at his
breakfast with considerable feeling. In
his landscapes he gets much of the
variety of light and shade in Nature.
“Tree Patterns, Croydon,” is a good
example.
Lawrence Pendlebury
Lawrence Pendlebury and his wife
(Nornie Gude) have been holding a joint
exhibition at George’s, Melbourne.
Nornie Gude’s watercolors are slighter in
texture than her husband’s oils, which
have a solid background of study in
them. His portrait of Professor W. A.
Osborne is a good likeness of the Dean
of the Faculty of Medicine at Melbourne
University, though tonally a trifle noisy.
“New Britain Coastline” looks like a
good impression.

Up the straight six at Flemington on Satur-
day River Hero (R. Heather), a beautifully-
bred horse by Hellespont from that fine mare
Rivette, showed great gameness to win under
a steadier of 9.9. Mysticus, an aged Pentheus
gelding, gave jthe winner a fight over the last
bit, but River Hero received the camera’s
verdict, and deserved it —he was conceding
Mysticus 351 b. David’s Last, favorite, was
third, unable to cope with a weight only 31b.
less than the winner’s.
“Lucky” Porter received a rather belated and
wintry smile from his joss when Stenelaus,
after a long string of outs, won the Benevolent
Fund Handicap. The name of the race was
appropriate: Porter must have done a
packet on racing so far this season. Stenelaus’s
rider, Badger, deserved most of the credit;
the Foxlight gelding showed a strong desire
to turn it in, but Badger’s vigor kept him
going tp beat Mokan and Orthodox.
Looking a little into the future, the John
James colt Two Kings (H. Badger) should do
well up the straight six. In winning the five-
furlongs Maroondah Handicap for two-year-
he started 22 out from the rails, but
didn’t waste ground crossing over.
an absolute beeline, he finished right under the
judge’s box to account for Athenaeum, an
improving filly, and Astor.
With topweight of 9.5, the promising Law
Maker colt Bray Law was, since he’s only a
three-year-old, given a stiff task in the Catani
Welter and it was no disgrace that he found
it beyond him. Round the turn he moved up
to a handy position, but was unable to sustain
the run. A rough ’un in Baffin Bay went on
to win it from Hartnell and Early Love, the
winner being ridden by M. Campbell,
On the aged Brueghel entire Sunrocks, W. A.
Smith gave a sound display of good patient
riding to win the Buxton Handicap for appren-
tices. Quickly securing a handy position behind
the leaders, he allowed his mount to settle down
and bided his time. When Analyst and Lugano
went very wide at the turn Sunrocks was through
in a flash, hitting out for the post and an
easy win. Queen of the Fairies just pipped
New Yorker for second money.
Though jumping events are not usually of
much account round this time of the year,
Colebrook (W. Aldridge), a six-year-old geld-
ing by The Buzzard, made a good impression
in winning the Lowan Hurdle from Priority
and General Cunningham. The placed horses
shared favoritism at threes. 9

Saturday at Canterbury was a held day for
sprinters, for the chaps who manipulate the
magic-eye camera, and for that vast minority
of racegoers content to keep their cash in the
pocket and enjoy just watching an exciting
finish. With a six-furloags Welter split into
three divisions, there were four races at that
distance and two Juveniles over five furlongs.
The Club Handicap also was shorter than usual,
being of nine furlongs, and the only thing
approaching a distance was the Trial Handicap
at a mile and three.
In the Trial the Enfield colt Le Fusil (J.
Thompson) raced out of restricted company
and stamped himself good by carrying 9.2 and
giving older horses much weight and a sound
beating. The only other three-year-old in the
event was on the limit mark, 7.7, while Haxton,
a five-year-old, was second in the weights, re-
ceiving 131 b. from Le Fusil; Haxton finished
second and Grahamstown third. Le Fusil, who
has won three races in a row, may be too
inexperienced yet for an important Handicap,
but he’s nicely in the Summer Cup with 7.6.
Thompson had an earlier success, winning
one of the Juveniles on Mandova, a bay colt
by Manitoba from the French-bred mare
Dorylee. Favorite, The Groom, was third
behind Willie’s Choice, who beat Mandova at
Newcastle recently. Connections should have
just about recouped the 725 guineas paid for
Mandova as a yearling. The fillies’ division
went to one of F. W. Hughes’ Nizami young-
sters, Ashmaganda (E. Fordyce), who downed
Robyn Lynette and Santa Maria in a photo.-
finish. It was a roughly-run race, with Santa
Maria and My Caravan on the receiving end
of interference which led to the stewards sus-
pending W. Hogg for a month and Fordyce
for two months —expensive at this time of year,
for Fordyce particularly.
Possibly having exhausted the list of- trainers
available, Hall Stand has reverted to the care
of H. Plant, who prepared him with some
success in the past. In the Flying Hall Stand
was ridden by W, Cook, another change, but
failed to get a place.. Maa Leesh, a six-year-
old Corban gelding, of some renown as a
sprinter on Queensland tracks, had his first
lash at the Sydney gallopers and, ridden by
Briscoe, made hacks oT them, Nepean River
and Chantilly filling the places.
Ridden a particularly good race by E.
Walmsley, the Eraborough gelding Homeleigh
Dick won the Canterbury Handicap, a race
marked by the poor showing of the favorite.
Magnificent; possibly the weight fixed him, as
he was conceding the others from 151 b. to 321 b.
Walmsley had his mount first out from the
start, settled back into the box seat, and, de-
spite meeting with a check at the turn, came
along nicely to win a photo .-finish from Laudus
and Invictus.
Verbage (R. McDonald) won the first division
of the Welter, beating Atherdon and Cavalero,
while the second division went to the Ajax mare
Sonning (N. McGrowdie), whose form is im-
“You'll have to use a Number Nine to get y'r ball, mister — Nick's
swallered it!"
proving. She downed Town Gossip and Crafts-to
man. As some compensation for his recent
disastrous trip south, Oriental (W. Cook) de-
feated Count Cosmo and Brilliant Manners in
the third division.

The Test:
Hammond’s remarkable runjof luck with the
coin deserted him when he needed it most —
for the first Test at Brisbane. Bradman flipped
an old English four-shilling piece; Hammond
called wrong, and the Australians went in to
bat on a batsman’s pitch.
Morris opened, with Barnes, but didn’t last
long, falling victim to Bedser with his score
only two. Then came Bradman, to play a
grand captain’s innings. The pair looked set
for a fair partnership until Barnes, after knock-
ing up a lively 31, played a poor shot, snapped
up by Bedser off Wright’s bowling. Hassett
contented himself with safe, sound play, leav-
ing his skipper to flog the bowlers, and Don
passed his 50, his century, his 150 and his
4000th Test run —another record for the book.
At stumps the first day it was 2 for 292, with
Hassett 81 and Bradman just twice as many.
On Saturday the partnership continued till
Bradman was clean bowled by Edrich after
knocking up a Brisbane Test record of 187,
and establishing with Hassett a third-wicket
partnership record of 276. Hammond’s de-
scription of Bradman in his book fits as well
today as when he wrote it: “Small, neat, cool,
he will long remain the pattern of a modern
batsman.”
Coming in next, for his first knock in a
Test match, Miller treated the crowd to an
exhibition ofjsclean hard-hitting, including one
mighty swipe which sent a no-ball to the top
of the stand: there was an extraordinary
number of no-balls, After being dropped
twice when he was 109, Hassett went on to
128 before Yardley held one off Bedser’s bowl-
ing. In the last over before tea Wright got
Miller l.b.w. at 79.
Johnson joined McCool, who kept the game
bright, thieving singles and smiting easier stuff
the pickets. At stumps Johnson was 47,
McCool 92 (including 13 boundaries) and the
total 5 for 595.
On a hit-out or git-out policy, the Australian
innings ended before lunch on Monday, leav-
ing the English a 645 total to chase. They
began very unhappily, losing Hutton for only
7 before rain began to take a hand.
* * * *
Bradman’s 187 was his 16th century in Tests
v. England and his 96th iri first-class cricket.
It boosted his Test aggregate to 4027, av. 85.78.
Bradman made his first century at Melbourne
in 1928-29; his highest in England was 334 at
Leeds in 1930, his best in Australia 270 at
Melbourne in 1936-37. When Hassett and
Bradman put on 276 for the third wicket it
rubbed out 249 made by McCabe and Brad-
man in 1936-37, and also Hammond’s and
Jardine’s 262 at Adelaide in 1928-29.
»••••*
Hassett had eight innings in Tests before
he notched his first Test century in the present
match. His previous best was 56 in the second
Test at Lord’s in June, 1938.
* * * *
A sad cricketing note comes from London,
where Sutcliffe has opened a fund in aid of
Phil Mead and Len Braund. Phil Mead was so
long associated with Test cricket that the story
is told of a spectator who greeted him in
Sydney in 1928 with the remark: “I am so
glad to meet you. I had the pleasure of know-
ing your father when he was out here in 1911.”
Mead is now blind, and Braund, remembered
as a particularly fine-looking stamp of a man,
has lost both legs. Hammond has often
acknowledged a thing he has experienced him-
self the generosity of Australian sporting
crowds, and an appeal to them, from him,
would not go unanswered. If, say, the Bedser
brothers, in cricket togs; were on the job for
a while taking the hat round at a Test match
they would collect more contributions for the
Mead-Braund fund than they could carry.

Von Nida ought to be suppressed or
restrained or painlessly extracted from
golf. A man who, after winning the
N.S.W. close championship, goes on to
Royal Sydney, rattles off a couple of
qualifying rounds of 66 and 67, then
cleans up all his opponents in match play
to win the N.S.W. pro, championship is
a sheer discouragement to all the fellows
battling round Week-end courses and
flattering themselves because a couple of
lucky putts enabled them to break 100.
Von Nida’s club simply touches the ball,
whereupon the thing flies straight for the
pin, whether it’s 30 or 300 yards away
and over, mountains, forests and water-
ways intervening. The champ’s only
trouble was in beating Cremin (it was
the first time he’d done it in match play)
two up—he had to reel off two approxi-
mate 67’s to do it, Cremin having a 67
and 68. Von Nida was untroubled to beat
the Australian Open champion, Pick-
worth, by eight up and seven in the final.

Making their first Australian appear-
ance in the Victorian championships
members of the U.S. Davis Cup team
mostly won their early matches as com-
fortably as would be expected, though
Ted Schroeder made heavy weather
against G. Schwartz (S.A.) before winning
7-5, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2. Finding touch then,
Schroeder thoroughly outplayed Gilchrist
6-3, 6-2, 6-4, Mulloy had to fight for
his 5-7, 7-5, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Lionel
Brodie. As the score suggests, Brodie’s
condition gave out in the fourth set, but
he still looks by far the most improved
of the Australian players, and would
probably be now ranked No. 3 for singles
play. For the doubles the Americans
teamed Talbert-Mulloy and Kramer-
Schroeder, while the main Australian
pairings for the Victorian matches are
Bromwich-Long, Pails-Brodie and Quist-
Brown. All had easy wins in early
matches.

At Leichhardt Tommy Colteaux (list.
121 b.), looking at least a stone above his
announced tonnage, fought 12 rounds
with Hockey Bennell (lOst. KHlb.) and
lost the lot. While Bennell’s straight lefts
and right uppercuts seldom missed, Col-
teaux usually found the North Sydney
man an absentee when he let loose right
swings of such nice intent that when one
of them failed to connect the momentum
took Colteaux on to crash in a corner. It
was so much Bennell’s way that even the
customers were satisfied to let him have
it on points.
Dave Sands (list. 81b.), leading partner
of the Sands, Sands, Sands, Sands and
Sands fist fraternity, demonstrated that
punching power isn’t altogether a lost art
when he met Alf Gallagher (12st. 7fib.)
at Sydney Stadium, Anyway, he floored
Gallagher eight times before the first
round ended, and knocked him out in
round three. Gallagher was unlucky to
survive for that final woodener; Joe
Wallis, his arithmetic already well tested,
had chanted up to “nine” when the first-
round bell sounded.

The People and the Budget
Since 1939 the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment’s control over the finances of the
nation has grown beyond the compre-
hension of the average citizen. But never
was an understanding of Government
finance needed more by the people. Pub-
lic taxing and spending is now the chief
economic factor in our lives.
From 1941 “Labor” has been in office,
and it has been a willing party to the
most extensive taxing and redistribution
of individual incomes, to heavy borrow-
ing and spending and to the concentra-
tion of financial power in the hands of
the Commonwealth Bank, which, in the
last resort, is controlled by the Treasurer
and Caucus. Two referendums seeking
additional legal powers, many of them
of an economic nature, have been put
before the people, but only one altera-
tion of the Constitution —it deals with
social services—has been sanctioned.
The Commonwealth Government now
collects all income tax and amusement
tax, as well as Customs and excise duties,
sales tax and payroll tax. It competes
with the States for land tax, estate duty
and gift duty. It allocates a portion of
its income- and amusement-tax collections
to the States, but its retained portion of
these collections is still far above its pre-
war experience. In 1938-39 the figure
was £l2 million. For the present year
Canberra proposes to spend £l6O million
derived from all kinds of income taxes —
financial power mulcted from industry
and the people—while the States will have
over £4O million to play with, compared
with less than £3O million in 1938-39.
Thus, whilst the growth of the Common-
wealth authority in the income-tax field
has been more than twelvefold, the war
has in no way restrained the tax-gorging
of the States, which, furthermore, are
dependent on Commonwealth doles on
as large a scale as ever.
It is estimated that in 1946-47 taxes
collected by the Commonwealth will
amount to £47 9s. Id. a head, compared
with £4B 7s. Id. last year. When the
flour tax, wool taxes and levies and the
wheat-export charge—all exacted from
a special section of the community—are
taken into account , the total tax charge
is heavier than at any time during the
war. In 1938-39 all Commonwealth and
State taxes totalled only £l7 19s. 6d. a
head. A present comparative figure would
be over £5O. And borrowing is far
greater than before the war.
With a higher revenue from Customs,
excise and company taxes, and allowing
for larger refunds of taxes to the
States, estimated net Commonwealth
tax collections work out at £315 million,
compared with last year’s record of £327
million, and with £77 million in 1938-39.
The post-office, railways, etc., are ex-
pected to yield £3O million in revenue this
year and to cost nearly £37 million, in-
cluding £8 million to be spent out of
revenue on new “works.” Before the war
similar revenue and expenditure were
£lB million and £2O million respectively,
including £4 million for “works.” The
post-office has developed into an addi-
tional taxing authority, this being freely
admitted when a halfpenny was added to
the twopenny postage in the early stages
of the war. The war i« over, but
Senator Cameron has made it clear the
tax is to continue.
In addition to its huge tax revenue, the
Commonwealth proposes to borrow £59
million this year in order to cover its
excess of expenditure over revenue. Last
year the gap was £153 million; but esti-
mated “defence” expenditure is £159 mil-
lion lower for 1946-47, showing that,
even with such tax concessions as have
been allowed, a balanced Budget this year
would have been conceivable had not
civil estimates swollen by £5l million.
Greatest growth in items of civil ex-
pense has been in the proposed transfer
(£64 million—£B 11s. a head) to the
National Welfare Fund (up £l7| million),
from which old-age, invalid and widows’
pensions are payable, as are maternity
allowances and child endowment, unem-
ployment-relief, hospital and pharmaceu-
tical “benefits” —when paid. The total
cost for the year is forecast at £67.6 mil-
lion, requiring a withdrawal from re-
serves, In 1938-39 invalid and old-age
pensions cost £l6 million (half this year’s
estimate). “Social-security” costs are now
a multiplication of what they were a
decade ago, and are still growing. Mr.
Chifley hopes to see the cost rise to £lOO
million a year.
The Department of the Interior is this
year splashing £1,075,000 about, com-
pared with £535,023 last. Works and
Housing spending goes up from £160,580
to £1,7p5,000. Similar inflation of de-
partmental expenses has doubled the ad-
ministrative vote, raising it to £l7 million.
Labor and National Service, a war-time
composition now carried into the civil
estimates, accounts for £1,209,000.
New “works” being arranged for
by various departments are costing £l5
million this year, compared with
£1,902,360 last. In other days these ran
to around £500,000 a year. In addition,
£2,550,000 is being spent on “works” for
the Territories (including Canberra),
making, with the P.M.G.’s proposed ex-
penditure, more than £25 million being
laid out on “works” from revenue in the
current year.
Departments, charges accruing from.
World War I and social-security costs are
down for £l2l million this year. In
1938-39 similar charges were £46 million.
In that last pre-war year World War II
was billed in anticipation for £9 million.
In this first full year of peace World.
War II is estimated to cost us £221 mil-
lion net. In between it has cost £2489
million.
Including Territories (£6 million) and'
payments to or on behalf of States (£l9
million exclusive of tax reimbursements),
total civil outgo for the present year is
given as £145 million, apart from post-
office and railway items. Corresponding
figure for 1938-39 was £65 million.
Interest on the 1939-45 war debt
(£1516 million at June 30 last) is put at
£37 million for the current year ; sinking-
fund appropriations account for another
£9 million. These are real and unavoid-
able legacies of the war, even though less
extravagant expenditure during the con-
flict would have keep the post-war debt
burden down.
Navy estimates for 1946-47 are half the
1944-45 total at £l9 million, the Army
is less than half at £73 million (this
figure including £3O million of outstand-
ing liabilities brought forward from pre-
vious years), and Air Force outgo is
about a quarter of the last full year of
war at £3l million. Total of the three
services is £124 million, compared with
£332 million two years earlier and £382
million in 1943-44.
Among an expensive addendum of
other “war” charges, reverse lend-lease
will cost us £5 million this year, and lend-
lease settlement £8 million ; all lend-lease
items ran into £26 million last year and
£B9 million the year before. U.N.R.R.A.
is down for £l5 million this year.
Post-war charges are mounting up.
Repatriation is allotted £8 million, mostly
“benefits.” Post-war Reconstruction is
appropriating £9 million for technical
training and £4 million for University
education —together up £lO million for
the year. Soldier land-settlement and
loans are down for million, and war
gratuity for £5 million. Total gratuity
liability is about £75 million, spread over
several years. Still included among items
of “war” expenditure are price subsidies
—£l6 million, compared with £l3 million
last year. It is costing over £5 million a
year in order to keep the prices of tea
and potatoes down—that is, when
potatoes are available and when the
price-ceiling is observed by retailers.
The Department of Supply and Ship-
ping is another buffer, operating at great
cost to the taxpayer, which aims to re-
strain inflating costs and prices. In its
Shipping Branch (requisitioned ships sec-
tion) there was a debit, of £3,107,393 last
year. This year the estimate is £1,086,590.
The Government runs the inter-State
passenger and cargo services, apparently
at a heavy loss. It is still paying war-risk
bonuses to seamen and loaded rates of
pay to wharfies. The Stevedoring In-
dustry Commission, which is supposed to
keep peace in the industry, cost £120,689
last year, and is down for £136,540 this.
In striking comparison, the Federal
Arbitration Court cost only £38,298 last
year, with £46,400 down for 1946-47.
. Total war and post-war charges for
this year of peace, £221 million, allow-
ing for all credits, disposals and re-
, o
coveries, compare with £378 million and
£460 million in the two years preceding.
The Budget totals £404 million this
' year (excluding State tax reimbursements)
compared with £95 million in the last pre-
war year. In addition, there are ex-
panded State Budgets to finance, and £45
million to be borrowed for State “works”
and £25 million for local-government
projects. Australian Governments this
year will spend in the vicinity of £550
milion, nearly half the national ncome.
With such a huge proportion of the
public’s money passing through its hands,
the Federal Government in particular in-
fluences the financial and industrial, life
of the nation to ,an extent bordering on
socialism. But, though it wields this
financial power, buttressed by 61 legalistic
controls carried forward from the
National Security Act into peace-time
legislation, it declines to accept the great
responsibility which should accompany
such taxing and spending power. It
plainly refuses to economise on non-pro-
ductive departmental expenditure, and,
whilst providing elaborate “social
security,” it shirks disciplining militant
unionists striking at production.'
The continued presentation of swollen
Budgets, full of departmental extrava-
gances, contradicts Mr. Chifley’Palleged
anti-inflation policy. More of the nation’s
funds should be employed in productive
industry. It is all very well to curb ex-
cessive spending-power by taxation. But
anti-inflation measures would be better
served if such taxes were used to reduce
the national debt instead of multiplying
the number of deadheads in various Gov-
ernment offices. And unless industrial
production is brought up to adequate
levels mere financial policy will not pre-
vent inflation. But financial policy can
be shaped to encourage production even
while controlling prices. The 1946-47
Budget does not conform with that shape.
Among Canberra developments last
week, by seven votes to five the Federal
A.L.P. executive accepted the Bretton
Woods agreement. Senator Cameron,
P.M.G., forecast retention of the ha’-
penny war-time addition to postage rates.
It, was announced that cash support for
tne £64 million Security Loan was
£5.5 million in excess of the amount
asked for; but the comparatively
few subscribers —190,000—indicated that
the loan was little, if any, more successful
than previous issues, in respect of which
savings banks were saddled with large
portions. The Customs authorities col-
lected £5 million duty on tobacco, etc.,
last year, and levied £8.6 million of
excise, plus £8 million on cigars and
cigarettes—total £21.5 million. Total levy
in 1946-47 is forecast at £23.7 million.
Excise on beer, £22.5 million last year,
is tipped at £24.4 million this. Sixty-one
National Security Regulations will be
carried forward to the end of 1947. By
this and other legislation “controls” to
be continued include those over prices,
rents, wages, marketing, female rates of
pay and rationing.

The National Income
The “net national income” of Aus-
tralia is estimated officially at £1247 mil-
lion for 1945-46, compared with £1231
million in 1944-45, £1279 million in
1943-44 and £BO3 million in 1938-39.
From the figures one might gather that
the income of Australia had risen by
over half during the war, and that it
was now slightly on the decline. But,
among other things which have to be
considered in studying these calculations,
it must be remembered that the unit of
measure used throughout is a monetary
one —the Australian pound—the buying-
power of which, whether in relation to
goods and services or labor, has fallen
considerably during the last seven years.
The national-income calculation is not
a true measure of the volume of our
production unless the monetary variation
is fully allowed for, and, during the war
and post-war periods, it is no indicator
of the standard of living. Volume or
nature of the production is not defined.
But the Commonwealth Statistician has
calculated that, during 1943-44, the value
of Australian resources devoted to war
was £548 million —very nearly half the
national income—whereas in 1945-46 it
had fallen to £278 million, and a figure
of £llO million is forecast for 1946-47.
With a lessening in the amount of “re-
sources devoted to war” it is to be ex-
pected that the civilian living standard
should rise provided the national-income
level and currency values remain stable
and the surplus of our exports over im-
ports does not rise to much larger pro-
portions than now.
It has been contended by some critics
of the national-income calculations that
the figure is largely based on payments,
not on income, and that it therefore is
misleading. Apparently such critics are
not versed in the elements of double-
entry bookkeeping, which lay it down
that every debit must have a correspond-
ing credit, and vice versa. The Statis-
tician comments: “The value of produc-
tion, after deducting financial provisions
for depreciation and maintenance, is
identical with the net national income,
and is the • aggregate income received by
producers (including owners of capital
equipment) in the form of wages and
salaries, other earnings, profits, rent and
interest.” He then presents his computa-
tion of the national income as follows:
1938- 1943- 1944- 1945-
39. 44. 45. 46.
£mil. £mil. £mil. £mil.
Wages and salaries .. 432 595 584 610
Service pay, allowances 4 195 189 156
Public-authority busi-
ness income .... 37 62 54 44
Net rents of dwellings 59 66 66 67
Other profits, rents, in-
terest and earnings 271 361 338 370
Net national income 803 1279 1231 1247
The Statistician comments further: “The
.three ways of looking at the economic
activity of the community—production
of goods and services, incomes which
arise from production and expenditure
of income in purchasing goods and ser-
vices produced—are simply three aspects
of one self-contained process. After
making allowances for overseas trans-
actions it can be said that total national
production, national income received and
national expenditure are identical with
each other.”
It is reckoned that personal expendi-
ture on consumer goods and services in
1945-46 was £B6O million, compared with
£731 million in 1943-44. This indicates
a change in the mode of living among
citizens since the end of the war. Gov-
ernment spending on war has shrunk, as
shown, while “private” investment has
risen from £45 million to £165 million.
“Direct taxes on persons,” however, have
risen since the war burden was greatest;
from £lOB million in 1942-43 to £167
million last year.
It is calculated that N. S. Wales resi-
dents have the biggest aggregate income
among the States —they accounted for
£5Ol million last year, Victorians for
£364 million, Queenslanders for £lB3
million. South Australians for £lO5 mil-
lion, Westralians for £B6 million and
Tasmanians for £37 million.
The State to show the greatest increase
in income by residents during the war
has been South Australia, with a growth
of 80 p.c., compared with 65 p.c. by
N. S. Wales. Victoria’s expansion has
been 77 p.c., Tasmania’s just under 80
p.c., Queensland’s 70 p.c. and Westralia’s
74 p.c.
Overseas Corporation (Australia), Ltd.,
has changed over from a private to a
public company, and it is proposed to
issue 140,000 new £1 ords., bringing sub-
scribed capital up to £200,000. The co.
was formed some time back, and it has
as its objects the providing of financial
and technical assistance to promising
industrial and trading enterprises, the
establishment and development of such
ventures, to negotiate and deal in patents,
processes, plant, etc., to provide speci-
alised staff and counsel for sponsored
and other companies, and to undertake
organised merchandising and export-
import activities for enterprises coming
within its orbit. Directors are G. J. Coles
(chairman); J. S. Storey (managing);
L. J. Hartnett; Norman Myer; H. F.
Richardson ; C. Wallace Smith; H. Van
de Velde and W. S. Wasserman (director
of the first U.S. lend-lease mission to
Austrajia and president of Overseas Cor-
poration, U.S.A.). Directors who have
recently resigned were: A. G. Warner,
S. Ricketson, G. H. Grimwade and A.
Lewis. All present and past directors
represent large Australian industries, with
the exception of Mr. Wasserman.

With the Democrats in power in the
U.S, Congress, and, more especially, with
Roosevelt as President, there was an ad-
ministrative tendency in America to con-
sider seriously an all-round, world-wide
reduction of trade barriers. An Inter-
national Trade Organisation has been
planned towards this end, and pre-
liminary discussions have already taken
place. But with the Republicans now in
power a change in the U.S. tariff atti-
tude is forecast. Any worth-while reduc-
tion in world trade barriers would need
to include U.S. cuts on a large scale, the
United States still having a highly-pro-
tected domestic market for many things
in spite of its large annual export sur-
pluses. The Republican party has now
asked the President to hold his hand on
any U.S. tariff reductions until it has re-
viewed the position. A great deal will
depend on the outcome of the review.


ABORIGINALITIES
wouldn’t stand an earthly of keeping up
with a horse, and more time would be
wasted mustering dogs than in getting
cattle on camp. And with a mob of
touchy cattle bn the road I would rather
be without a dog any day—or night.
When there were 60,000 sheep on Avon
Downs, N.T., even they were worked
entirely without dogs. If dogs had been
used in the film it would have driven the
old Camooweal drovers to drinking milk-
shakes.

“Mat’s Mate”: Somewhere south of
Swan Hill (Vic.) in a rainy dusk, me and
Mat dropped our wet swags on the veran-
dah of a homestead and asked the yeo-
man for permission to spend the night
in a shed we’d sighted at the rear. The
sturdy agriculturist wiped the remnant
of his initial grin off his whiskers and
curtly told us to get to a distant and
much drier spot, since he had no time
for “loafin’ cows who bludged about
the roads expectin’ other people to feed
an’ house ’em,” -Restraining Mat with
some difficulty I got him away and we
found a doubtful shelter under some pines
down the road. Next morning the
weather had cleared and we had a fire
going, drying out our things, when an
earnest young man arrived per bike and
asked us how we were doing. We told him.
“Well, I must get on to school,” he said,
then added, “Interesting part this. See
that blouse over there? Well,- Burke
and Wills passed that very spot.” Mat
glared at the home of the inhospitable,
“Old-timer”: Old Jack Day, cashed
up, blew into Euston (N.S.W.) from down
the river, stabled his horse and sulky,
irrigated and went about his business
around the town. Later in the afternoon,
business finished, he irrigated some more
but not enough to interfere with his men-
tal or physical equilibrium, ate a hearty
tea, smoked a contemplative pipe on the
verandah and, about 8 p.m., mildly re-
marked that it “was about time I turned
in. Alius get orf t’ Blanket Flat airly,”
and withdrew. His room fronted the
verandah and we heard him moving
about. Then, dumb with astonishment,
we saw him appear with a blanket roll
and go down toward the river. Specu-
lation crystallised into .a conviction that
he intended to set night-lines and camp
beside them, whereupon a deputation
must needs set forth to investigate. It
found the old cove asleep on a level
piece of river-bank, and, seeing no lines,
couldn’t refrain from wakening him and
demanding whatinell he was doing sleep-
ing out there when he had a room booked
in the pub. “Once got bit be bugs,” he
explained, far from annoyed. “Never bin
game t’ doss in a pub ever since.” “But,
strike me roan,” said Pocketknife, “what
about out here? Flamin’ greenhead ants
an’ jumpers an’ sand scorpions an’ whip-
tails t’ get in your blankets —an’ snakes
all over the place!” “Aw, them,” mur-
mured Mr. Day, snuggling down happily.
“I’m used t’ them things.”

“C.E.”; The brindle pup arrived ap-
parently from nowhere, and soon centred
> his affections on Jim. Following the
hand round the paddocks, he ran a rabbit
into a log, and great was his excitement
when his new boss lit a fire on the end
and brought forth a bunny that was
easily picked up. Next day when they
came on another treed rabbit and the
performance was repeated, the pup’s ad-
miration ran wild, and he spent the next
few weeks industriously hunting bunnies
to be smoked out. At meal-times he
crept under Jim’s chair, and at night he
slept on Jim’s boots. Then Jim began a
job of burning off. At the first fire the
pup cocked an expectant eye and waited.
With two going, he divided his attention
worriedly. By the end of the day he
spent less time on the hundred-odd fires
and more watching Jim in dawning
suspicion. Two days he stuck it, then
in open disgust walked off the job. Old
Sam is now the adopted owner of a stray
brindle pup.

“Bulago”; “Moya” betrays himself as
a Southerner (B. 6/11/ ’46) in finding fault
with the absence of cattle-dogs in “The
Overlanders.” Things may have changed
of recent times, but in all the years I
spent ringing ’em on the Barkly Table-
land, elsewhere in the Territory and N.Q.,
as well as bringing mobs from the Terri-
tory to the Cooper and* farther in, the
only dogs in existence were in the blacks’
camp and there they stayed. I have used
dogs on the road from Longreach south-
ward and have found them of greatest
use in rough, thick-timbered country.
But out on the open downs, where cattle
streak in top gear for the horizon when
they sight a musterer a mile away, a dog
“Our company pays, all death claims immediately."
then he barked, “Did they camp there?”
“No,” was the answer. “No ruddy
wonder! ” roared my mate, and there was
that in his voice which sent the school-
master hastily on his way.

“M.U.R.”: Overnight the garden spider
had hung her web between the' gum-tree
and the verandah post and, as I was
admiring it in the morning light, a beetle
the size of a small almond and nearly
twice the size of her ladyship blundered
into it. The spider dropped like a shot
on to the captive, whipped a few strands
of gossamer about it, then proceeded
gather leisurely to roll it over and over,
wrapping web around it like a bandage.
With the beetle almost unable to wink an
eye she then changed her grip and rolled
it the other way, after which; having
thoroughly enclosed that beetle in a
cocoon of web, she withdrew, presum-
ably to wash her hands pr something. I
picked up a few dry gumnuts and flicked
one into the web. Down she came,
touched it, leapt back an inch or so,
appeared to ruminate, then rushed at the
gumnut and whipped a few strands about
it. Then, probably discovering that it was
worthless for the larder,- she carefully
unrolled the strands, held the gumnut out
from the net and dropped it to the
ground. She repeated this performance
with two more gumnuts, but when the
fourth hit the web she came only part
way down, eyed it a second and retired.
Reasoning power?

“Blime”: Ted ran an experienced eye
over the lambs in the catching pen,
grabbed the big crossbred in the corner
and trotted back to his stand. The belly
off, he was racing up the neck when
there was a mighty gush of blood. He
pushed out his machine and yelled to a
rousie as the boss strolled over. “No use
tryin’ to stitch it,” snapped the boss.
“The jug’lar’s cut. Good lamb, too.
Better dress it for rations,” he told the
rousie. A couple of days later Alec,
shearing from the next pen, slit the intes-
tines of a young wether beyond repair.
“Gripes, the thing kicked sudden an’ I
sort o’ lorst me balance on the slipp’ry
floor,” he explained apologetically, as
another animal Was carried to the killing
yard. Followed two days without acci-
dent; then Ted overtook his hutmate on
their return to the shed after the midday
break. “What y’ doin’, Alec?” he asked.
“Old ewes,” was the reply. “What’re
you?” “Rams,” came the disgusted snort.
Alec grinned. “Mick’s on weaners,” he
volunteered, “an’ I reckon it’s up to him
to help. Slip him the word. No, not a
bad little joint this t’ shear at,” he re-
marked approvingly, “ ’cept f’r the boss’s
fixed (dears ’bout us eatin’ old mutton.”

“E. 2”: The timbers of the old bridge
were rotting, and Mullins was a bit
dubious of its standing the strain of the
wood-carting. So he told Alec to be
careful and give it a good trial before
bringing the usual loads over. About
midday Alec was back to tell him the
dray had gone through the decking.
Hurrying over, Mullins found the greatly
overloaded vehicle wedged in the broken
planks, while the roan gelding hung half-
suspended in the shafts. An hour’s toil
with ropes and tackle was needed to
rescue the horse, and soon after the re-
mains of the bridge collapsed with the
dray into the creek. “Are y’ satisfied
now, y’ blanky nitwit?” growled Mullins.
“After me tellin’ y’t’ take it easy y’ put
on twice the usual load. Now see what’s
happened! ” “But don’t fergit y’ told me
t’ try the bridge first,” Alec protested,
gaping at the ruins. “A bloke ’ad t’ see
how much it’d stand before ’e’d know
wot was a safe load, didn’t ’e?”

“Horseless Horseman”: Quail migrate
all right (B. 2/10/’46). Droving along the
Darling years ago we saw scarcely one of
the brown .seed-eaters on those parched,
wind-swept plains until April, 1932, when
a record rain at Wilcannia two months
before had transformed those wastes into
a green sward. Then on Belila and Tin-
tinology, quail were so numerous that
their continual rising kept scaring our
road-weary wethers as well as horses and
dogs. Quail, like most Australian game
birds, follow the rains, or rather the grass
and insect life that follow the down-
pours. Another instance of this is along
the Murray around Robinvale, where the
Victorian Government has been try-
ing to hold a grasshopper plague in check
with aerial spraying. In flocks of thou-
sands, millions of martins arrived to
dine on the insects, although no one there
remembers these birds in numbers before.
Incidentally, the new spray, Gammexane,
kills the hoppers without destroying the
bird-life. At most the drug-killed insects
make the martins a little groggy.

“Ex-Mister”; Despite recent official
doubts concerning a missing ration-book
alleged to have been eaten by an elephant,
I am convinced that the explanation was
true. In the brave old days when Hurri-
cane Thompson skippered the Wodbnga
with Skye-bred Chon Mackay as re-
lieving mate, we took on a circus at Glad-
stone (Q.), stowing the elephant on the
for’ard well-deck. As we came to anchor
off Mackay, Chon on the fo’c’sle head
complete with carpenter and bos’n, and
engines stopped, Hurricane’s famous
voice boomed from the bridge, “Let go! ”
The starboard anchor splashed and, dom-
inating the chain’s roar, came the order r
“Give her fifteen, Mister.” Chon, his
eye on the running chain, signalled to
key up on the patent gear. Nothing
happened. “The key; ye loon,” he bel-
lowed. “Bose ’as it,” stammered Chips.
“Y’re a . liar-r,” yelled the bos’n.
“Get the spare, ye gomeril,” thundered
Chon, and to the bridge, “Sent for
anither key, sir-r.” The island lighthouse
shook as Hurricane emitted cyclonic
orders to pick up and make another
sWeep, ending with a promise that if he
should ever hear of a vacancy for the
secretaryship of a home for demented
ducks he would certainly recommend
Chon for it. As that sorely-tried sea-
man came down the ladder later, the
job done at last, a little Cockney passenger
sidled up. “Hi seen where that hiron bar
went, guv’nor.” “Where?” growled
Chon. “When the first bloke was
’andin’ it ter t’other an’ y’ was alf lookin’
the other way that there blinkin’ heler-
phunt took hit houter ’is ’and an ' r ?PP
it hover the side. Mischievious animiles

“Hanko”: There was room in the
wagonette, so we picked up and delivered
the coils of wire consigned to McThistle.
Angus was delighted by the neighborly
action and pressed us to stay for a “bit
crack.” The boss wiped his mo. with
an anticipatory flourish and said he didn’t
mind if he did, whereupon the Scot
rambled on about the awfu’ times, awfu’
prices, awfu’ weather, etc., till the trump
told him we’d have to get along. “Ah,
weel, thank ye verra much,” said Angus.
“The old cow had no intention of crackin’
a bottle,” fumed the boss as we rattled
away. “All he wanted was to hold us
up for a bit of a yarn.” I could have
told him that, but not just then,

“X.E.D.”: “I’m earnin’, a crust on the
widder McGurck’s fruit farm, an’ things
are lookin’ pretty good f’r a time,” related
Harry. “The widder’s a fair terror t’ work
f’r, but she singles me out f’r invitin’ up
t’ the house, an’ I reckon all that’s waitin’
is f’r me t’ say the word. But she comes
weepin’t’ me one mornin’ an’ tells me I’ve
done me job f’r bein’ too ’andsome an’
attractive. The on’y way she c’n save the
place f’r her kid at school is by marryin’
the wealthy bloke on the next farm an’
he’s a jealous cove an’ will on’y allow a
ricketty coot like old Scrawny Jack
workin’ on her place. ‘Wait six munce
till 1 git back,’ I ses t’ the widder. ‘l’ll
raise the wind some’ow t’ pay orf the
mortgage.’ I gives her a kiss t’ remember
me by an’ sets out t’ the head of Haunted
Crick on a prospectin’ trip. Well, f’r five
munce I slaved without seein’ as much
as a color; then up pops a boulder of
quartz that is fairly studded with gold.”
“An’ you raced back with the stuff f
claim your bride before . the time was
up?” I chipped in. “Well, not erzackly,”
said Harry. “Took me a few days fixin’
up with a feller about floatin’ the claim,
an’ when I git back the widder’s spliced
t’ Scrawny Jack, who’s drawn third prize
in a lot’ry.”

“W.J.W.”: I bushwhacked with an old-
timer who brought an unerring instinct
to the locating of bee-hives. Only once
did we draw a blank, and then the old
chap’s perplexity deepened as we cut
deeper into the hollow without striking
honey. After we’d gouged out the entire
hive we found the cause—a ring-tailed
opossum. Snug in his home alongside the
hive, he’d waxed fat on the bees’ industry,
while his furry hide evidently rendered
him immune from their attacks. Don’t
know what the bees gained from the part-
nership, but their interest was probably
akin to that of union members with a
Commo secretary.

“Tackline S.”: In Rabaul I met the
first white man to go up the Sepik River,
except for one who was murdered. Head-
hunting locals were the only boongs he
had known to take anti-malarial pre-
cautions. At dusk the native, together
with his Mary, three or four children and
sundry fowls and pigs, battened down into
a huge basket. This not only excluded
mosquitoes but air as well. Opened up in
the morning, the stench from the stale
air was enough to knock over a new-
comer. However, the basketed inmates
seemed to feel no discomfort. They were
completely free of the New Guinea
scourge.

“Goldie”: Tell “Gravelsnatcher” (B.
13/11/ ’46) I used the term “nitro-glycer-
ine” in the broad sense. The gelignite
we use is labelled 50 or 60 per cent, nitro-
glycerine and I’ve handled gelatine gelig-
nite, rated 75 per cent, n.-g., without
necessity for more than the usual intelli-
gent precautions. While we’re splitting
hairs, though, it may be as well to record
that gelignite is regarded as unworkable
when frozen and should be thawed out
slowly in a water-jacketed container. The
stuff burns readily with the sizzling of
saltpetre, and we once had a small stock
burned out in a magazine during a bush-
fire without explosion. I recall a miner
losing a hand while spitting fuses with
gelignite ; by some mischance he got a
plug burning, and the explosion resulted
on his attempting to douse it in water.
My conclusions on gelignite, after some
years of experience, are that it is a per-
fectly safe and stable explosive to use
provided care is taken to see that it is
in proper condition and the correct
methods are adhered to in its handling.
Don’t handle it under doubtful conditions,
for there’s no telling at what stage the
margin of safety will be just a shade too
small.
THE DROVER.
I spoke one day to a drover
As he reined his horse to a stand
And wiped the sweat from bis forehead
With a lean and sunburned hand,
While the grey dust settled slowly
And noon lay strong on the land.
“These winding roads you wander
Must some day reach their end;
Old serpent Time lies sunning
Himself at every bend v
And lifts his head and watches
As you pass by, my friend.
“Your cheque’s across the counter
And, drink you ne’er so slow,
Sip one by one the seconds
• From dawn to sunset glow,
Through day and week and season
Your own life’s coin you blow.
“Will you feel a qualm when the finger
Points to the settled score,
Regret for the squandered splendor,
Fear of what lies before,
As you say ‘Here’s luck’ with the last one
And turn to the open door?”
The drover sought for his answer
Out on the dancing plain:
“I would not sleep tomorrow
Where I tonight have lain,
And what is done and ended
Is not to <jo again.
“Wealth lies on level highways,
Wealth, glistening in the sun,
And blinds the shuffling seekers
—Fools’ gold: let me be one
Who strode through many a midnight
—My shins can show the scars —
And stumbled over nuggets
To look up at the stars.”
VICTORIA.
LINDSAY CARROLL.


“Bo”: Jimmy the timber-getter had
reached the well-defined stage of self-
humiliation during one of his benders.
“Careful with the cup!”
As he leaned against a pub verandah-
post, coat off, his well - developed
biceps aroused the vocal admiration
of a humorous-faced man whose car
had been parked outside. The stranger,
hearing someone remark that Jimmy
wielded a Kelly for a crust, ventured the
opinion that Jimmy looked every inch a
champion. This, uttered in Jimmy’s
hearing, brought from him a modest
denial of any extraordinary, or even
ordinary, gifts. He was a failure;
couldn’t do anything, and had never done
anything, and no greater dud ever ran
a file over an axehead. After he
had thus finished scourging himself
Jimmy looked up in an astonish-
ment that almost sobered him to
see the humorous-faced one dangling
a ten-shilling note in front of him.
“You’re the first timber man I’ve ever
met,” the stranger said, “who didn’t skite
about being the smartest man with an axe
in the State. Your unusual modesty de-
serves recognition. Here” —and with a
wide grin he stepped into his car. It would
be about half an hour later that a figure
emerged from the pub, truculently dashed
a battered hat down on the roadway,
pulled off his shirt and, loudly asserting
that he was the best man in the Com-
monwealth, offered to fight, sing, wrestle,
race or chop anyone for a hundred quid ;
stuff up or shut up. It was James, now
thoroughly ripe and arrived at the second-
last stage of his binge.

“Mark Time”: Don’t know if a turtle
actually shares that peculiarity which
helped put the emu and kangaroo on our
coat of arms —they can’t propel them-
selves backwards —but it certainly seems
like it. Have seen dozens of dead female
turtles with their heads stuck through a
brush fence, apparently refusing to be
deflected from the path they have chosen,
especially when they have just come
ashore to lay eggs. Turtles will refuse or
are unable to back-pedal after having
thrust their heads through an unyielding
aperture —and there they keep thrusting
forward until they give up the ghost.

“Niloc”: Winded by a beefy elbow be-
longing to a lady wrestler attempting to
board a Sydney tram, I was reminded of
the many ways in which other animals
fight for existence. If you start off with
the queen bee and work right up to Moby
Dick you have quite a variety of combat.
One feature throughout, probably start-
ing in the days of dinosaurs, is the hold
on throat or neck. Even the horse, after a
preliminary of trying to boot its rival to
death, will fasten on to the mane
with its teeth in an effort to snap
the spinal cord. One of the old
Roman Emperors backed his opinion
that a wild stallion could pull his
weight in any Donnybrook by placing
one in the arena with a lion, a wolf, a
bear and a jaguar. The nag emerged
triumphant. First prize for gentlemanly
tactics when peeved goes to the ring-tailed
possum. Whenever two of the breed
locate simultaneously the same dwelling-
place they simply sit on the tree-branch
and glare at one another. Eventually the
loser, outstared, shuffles off with his ring-
tail well between his legs, leaving the
other in possession. What a candidate
for a seat on the Security Council of
U.N.0.!
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”; At the top of my
paddock is the sizable home of black
ants. The dome-shaped exterior is the
scene of multitudinous activities on fine
days, food-seekers and home builders co-
operating in a manner to be admired.
Came an unusual heavy summer rain of
several days’ duration. Near-by rabbit-
warrens were flooded, and the inhabit-
ants, including goannas, were forced to
seek higher shelter. Operations ceased on
the mound. With the return of fine
weather they were resumed, the numbers
of workers dispelling any fears that the nest
had been flooded. Obviously the cement
manufactured by the ants and used in
the nest’s construction had kept out the
water, and their unimpaired vigor sug-
gested that they have some method or
controlling temperature Their stocks or
food, of course, would be ample tor a
sustained drought —or flood. I found
what I sought: two ants striving to con-
vey a large morsel to the mound. They
tugged, heaved and strained, and always
in opposite directions. They held parleys
and appeared to try each other’s sugges-
tions, until negotiations broke down and
hostilities commenced. Soon each was
joined by supporters and the battle raged
over that section of the mound, peace
being resumed only when ant-honor,
apparently, was satisfied. Then both
“Where's your swimming togs?"
parties went their ways, entirely forget-
ting the original bone of contention.
* * * *
“Plankton”: An English zoologist has
asserted that birds can see most colors,
“but they do not see blue very well, and
violet not at all.” This observation cer-
tainly cannot be applied to the satin
bower-bird, whose obsession for collect-
ing blue objects is celebrated. That fowl,
incidentally, has the bluest eyes of all
birds. The zoologist also contends that
in the coloration of birds “violet is not
found and blue uncommon, but when a
bird has blue feathers they are a definite
and bright blue.” Among our birds the
eastern swamp-hen (purple gallinule or
red-bill) has flanks of indigo-blue, a color
also common to the dollar bird. A most
decided example is the male satin bower-
bird in mature plumage, characterised by
this color and having a violet tinge at
that; in fact, the specific name given the
bird is “Violaceous.”
* * * *
“Dicky Beach”: Notwithstanding all
the splendid mendacity so frequently en-
countered in coastal N.Q. pubs when the
beer is on, Australia’s longest recorded
eel measured barely 13ft. and weighed
241 b. at capture. It was caught in the
Maroochy River, some 70 miles north
of Brisbane and more than 300 miles
from the Barrier Reef, and is now an
exhibit in the Brisbane Museum. Though
so slim of build, it provided some distinct
thrills for its captor, the late W. J. Butt,
Dozing around midnight under the boat-
awning, Butt felt a steady pull on the gut
line and struck. Expecting a cod, he
played it carefully, getting in .more line
after each short run. Then, over the port
gunnel into the lantern light, emerged the
narrow black head of an apparently
average-sized eel. As he disappointedly
pulled it in there came a splash to star-
board, a heavy wet clout on his left ear,
and a lot of something wriggling slimily
over his feet. By now fully awake, he
clouted the creature’s head against the
gunnel with a waddy and began to haul
in apparently interminable squirming
lengths of eel which looked like filling the
whole boat. A few days later the
Museum authorities were congratulating
him on an all-time Australian record, but
he would have much preferred a decent
cod to all that mess and bother.
* * * *
“Plop”: When posters put up in the
township announced the near - future
arrival of a fair-sized “rodeo,” Harry Barr,
who’d had almost a lifetime in the saddle,
decided to have a crack at the prize-
money and went into training. He
borrowed every animal that his neighbors
wanted quietening, and rode them almost
into the ground. We thought it strange
when on the afternoon before the opening
Harry approached his old Clydesdale,
saddle in hand. To our query he re-
plied that he was “toppin’ off his trainin’
on Prince—y’ never know what y’ll strike
in this ’ere Ro-dayo.” We wondered even
more when Prince went through a per-
formance that appeared to include a
couple of Catherine-wheels with its rider
still attached to the pigskin. Someone
sorted it out then that the noises coming
from his canning-shed were due not to a
faulty ball-race in the separator but to a
portable gramophone turned full-on and
expounding Spike Jones’s latest horror for
the horse’s benefit,
* * * *
“Fang”: Bourke-street bushmen and
others marvel at the tolerance of the
wedgetail eagle in permitting the tomtit
to nest in the drayload of timber where
Ma Wedgie is raising her clutch. From
my observation of his domestic arrange-
ments the champion glider doesn’t seem
to have much option in the matter. The
midget chooses his position so that to
eject him his landlord would have to pull
the ancestral home to bits. No doubt
Tom takes an interest in having the wed-
gjes around to scare off marauders, but
there’s an even chance that the little
fellow merely resumes part of the pile
0 f sticks as a natural site for home-
building with the same airy disregard for
the owner as is exhibited by the Housing
Commission,

“Wayfarer”: It must have teen an
uncommon gander that bluffed “Spooks”
(B. 18/9/’46) into the belief that the
common gander is a bluffer. This species
of waterfowl can both bite and hit. The
passing of nearly 60 years hasn’t obliter-
ated the memory of an attack by a
gander. I was holding a goose while a
brother arranged the eggs in the nest.
j n response to an SOS from his spouse
the gander planed from an adjoining pad-
dock, promptly grabbed my ear in his
beak and proceeded to deal out violent
blows with his wingjoints. Offending
tykes don’t wait on the order of their
going when an irate gander goes for them,

“Bull-ant Bill”: Old Joe worked for a
while on a bee-farm in the long-ago, and
it occurred to me that a spare hive of
ours might amuse him as well as give
him a bit of honey. “No thanks, Bill,’
he replied. “ ’Ad enough uv them bone-
’eaded buzzers t’ last me a lifetime,
Lotter silly old-maid factory ’ands an’
’ousemaids, that’s all bees is. Work?
’Course they work. Ain’t never ’ad
nothin’ else t’ do ’cept lookin’ after
mother an’ ’tendin’ ter the kids what’s
still cornin’ along even though their dad
only ’ad a ’oneymoon with ’er an’ then
got stung ter death proba’ly, pore cow.
’Eartless lotter females, bees. That there
old-maid postmistress down at the town-
ship alwiz reminds me of one of ’em.
Only thing she’s got in life’s ’er work
an’ ’er sting. She’s got a bit the better
uv bees, ’cos they can only sting
once an’ it kills ’em. Lots in these ’ere
parts ’as wished it’d kill ’er, stingin’ ’em,
but she’s good-oh yet an’ still stingin’.
Thanks all the same, but you’d better pass
’em enter ’er. They’ll get on fine ter-
gether, them an’ ’er.”

“Hanko”: The overseer’s orders were
for all hands to repair to the ram-pad-
dock windmill to drain away a spill-over,
“Dig a drain to the nearest slope and
run it out to nothing,” he finished airily,
We got out tools and clattered away like
a squadron of ironmongers’ light-horse,
Along a bit Big Joe let out a sudden bull-
like roar: “Hey, Snowflake, where’s y’r
pick an’ shovel?” Jackie turned in the
saddle and grinned widely. “I’m goin’
on the part where she runs out to
nothin’,” he said. It brought a laugh
from us, but Big Joe, in the role of
mounted navvy, was liverish. “Go back,”
he snarled at the startled abo., “and fetch
four sinking bars and a hand pump.”
THE GREAT THEME.
They say, the alien critics, we have no worthy
themes
For great historic pictures or pleasant lyric
dreams;
We lack, these newchums tell us, in fiction and
romance
Fit subjects for expression; our past is mean,
perchance.
But we who sail in fancy with Pelsart, Cook
and Bligh
Behold a Grand Procession of storied years
go by.
We see the dark Dravidian who after Keilor
Man,
With Stone-age weapons landing, a nomad life
began;
We see the pigtailed Mongol in junks from far
Cathay
Our northern shores approaching, ere came
the brown Malay;
We see the turb'aned Arabs, the jealous Por-
tuguese,
With carvels out of Goa, exploring Indian seas.
We see a Javan culture in near-by islands rise
While tribal law and habit prevail ’neath Aus-
tral skies;
And then, in nearer vision, the pageantry of
years
Presents the hither-coming of stolid Dutch
mynheers:
Dick Hartog in his Endracht, famed Abel Tas-
man—all
Those seadogs out of Holland, brave figures,
great and small!
We mark the Spanish captains by Torres
charting ways
For galleons to follow in buccaneering days;
We hear French sailors singing by chill Tas-
manian shores
Refrains of Gallic ditties while fall their drip-
ping oars.
And thus the scene is colored and so the story
runs
Until Port Jackson echoes the boom of Phillip’s
guns.
Now, leaving Bass and Flinders to line their
careful charts,
In quest of landward subject's for our creative
arts
We climb with hardy Blaxland a wall of distant
blue
The %-een arresting picture of Bathurst plains
to view.
Thence onward with the horsemen for long,
long years we ride
Through new-found hills and ranges, o’er
virgin pastures wide.
That brave, exploring epic was written line on
line
By courage and endurance. With qualities as
fine
The pioneers came after —can nothing great be
writ
Of those who faced the Inland and learned to
conquer it?
We see their lonely outposts, their campfires
in the Bush,
And find no lack of subject for chisel, pen
and brush.
Aye, stories yet for telling our writing folk
await
Of whaleships on the coastline, and sealers in
the Strait;
Of this young land’s expansion, slow-marked
upon the page
Until a miner’s washdish proclaimed the Golden
Age,
And clipper ships came racing from ports of
all the earth
With fortune-seekers crowded, in Southern ports
to berth.
And have we not the drama of those who
with their blood
Twice sealed the sacred charter of our free
nationhood?
Who in brown ranks heroic fought grimly,
gamely on —
As fought, by foes outnumbered, the youth of
Marathon.
Their deeds shall surely call us Homeric lines
to speak
As called throughout all ages the genius of
the Greek.

TH E MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Wool Prices.
“Graz”; How long will they hold?
Buyers are going to excessive limits to
obtain spinner types free of fault that can
be quickly processed. Supply is far short
of demand, and European countries, so
often a prey to inflation, desire to ex-
change their foreign credit resources for
wool —a commodity dented them for six
years. French mills are very active, and
their buyers will operate while sterling
credits are available.
Some weeks ago the P.M. indicated
that European countries were seeking
Australian credits, but no more has been
heard of it, though the lifting of Ameri-
can price controls may mean that Ameri-
can bidding will make up for any weak-
ening in demand from France.
In addition to the high price of wool
the cost of processing it has risen sharply
since 1939, and there is a likelihood of
higher prices for wool products, turning
people to substitutes. Wool went too high
in the first half of the previous boom
season, 1924-25, averaging £4O a bale.
It then dropped, and the average for the
whole season was £35.
Drought in exporting countries, plus
excess slaughtering over natural increases
in U.S. and Britain, has curbed wool
production. It will take at least four
years to catch up with the demand for
spinner wools, which are fetching prices
that will induce graziers to switch back
to fine and superfine breeders. The cur-
rent clip contains too much burry and
droughty wool, and bales are 5.51 b. lighter
than last season. There has been a
marked falling-off of free, fine wools
compared with clips of 20 years ago.
Dalgety’s Review.
“R.N.”: Given the chance to review
the whole period of war-time wool ap-
praisements and the first season of open
selling, Dalgety’s 48th annual “Wool Re-
view,” just issued, has excelled itself. The
thing is a mine of information on all as-
pects of the wool business in Australia
and New Zealand, with sidelights on wool
matters in other countries and articles
and well-informed comment on relative
fibres like rayon and cotton.
Other points touched upon are the
clothes-rationing system, the possibility of
expanding the Australian textile trade,
the effect of price-fixing, impact of strikes
on the wool industry (Dalgety’s recently
felt the impact of a strike engineered by
the Communist-led Clerks’ Union, though
this isn’t mentioned), pastoral research
and so on —the whole making a book
that nobody interested in wool should be
without.
Weighing the Milk.
“Aerogenes”: Weighing and recording
of the milk yielded by every cow at every
milking is well worth the cost of a spring
balance and the time. Even if unable to
test for butter-fat the farmer can still de-
termine (a) which cows give too little
milk to be profitable, even if their fat
test were above the average ; ( b ) when a
springing cow is at about the right stage
of lactation for drying-off; (c) actual
production results of the feeding pro-
gramme and when a change should be
made. It is more profitable to perceive
and check a downward trend early than
to restore cows to milking form after a
slump in production and a heavy drain
on the cows’ bodily reserves. A decrease
in total milk may not be due to feed
shortage ; * and the fact that others are
normal can only be shown by individual
recording.
Onset of individual disturbances such
as heat periods, mammitis, red-water or
digestive troubles are not easily observed
in the early stages, but are reflected in the
weight of milk yielded. Effects' of-
temperature changes and exposure to
rain, sun, thirst or long walks to feed-
ing paddocks can be shown, and will
indicate an alteration in methods.
Further, weight - testing will show
whether each milker is doing his job
properly.
Plants in use overseas hold the milk
in a glass bowl and show the weight on
a large dial. This is quickly recorded
and the tap turned to empty the bowl
between cows. Such plants should be
installed here, or the bucket-and-scales
method extended to add some exact
science to the job.
Dairymen are too easily satisfied by
reports of yields such as “a brimming
three-gallon bucket twice a day” which
turns out, minus froth and exaggeration,
to be no more than 221 b. in the morning
and 151 b. in the evening!
Eradicating Bunny.
“Dusty Gully”: On good feed a rabbit
will eat its own weight in greenstuff in
“Mind if I nail it here, boss? The bridge has gone.”
24 hours; dry times find the pests living
on roots and seeds of valuable grazing
plants. A good doer even in hard seasons,
bunny hops in to the choicest patches and
crops grass closer to the ground than
other animals. In any class of country
soil destruction is greatly accelerated by
rabbit-infestation.
Trapping accounts for large numbers
of rabbits, but isn’t effective in cleaning
up the pests. Professional trappers who
know their onions go for the best market-
able rabbits to be caught on the dung-
hills, leaving the breeding does and kit-
ten's for another crop. Trapping on its
own merely prunes and disperses the
rabbits, though it may have some advan-
tages in a concerted drive to eliminate
rabbits from a farm.
In open country where harbors are few,
warrens are the main worry and should
be dealt with by digging out or fumiga-
tion with something like Cyanogas. The
burrows should be dug in thoroughly
when fumigation has done its work.
Poison stiffens rabbits prolifically, and
the skins should bring in good returns.
Best all-round-the-year poisoning is done
with apples and strychnine in fresh fur-
rows. The apples should be peeled and
diced small, loz. of strychnine and 11b.
sugar dusted evenly over about 121 b.
of fruit. Run the furrow close in to
the harbors and free feed liberally for a
few nights before laying the poison. A
spell of wet weather is the biggest check
to this method; other baits such as
quince, pollard or thistle roots are not
always so good when there’s feed about.
Make a job of cleaning up or netting off
the harbors when the surplus bunnies are
dealt with.
Fodder Conservation.
“Jumbuck”; Pastoralists are themselves
partly to blame for drought losses. In
practically all grazing areas fodder could
be conserved during lush seasons. I’ve
seen millions of acres of Mitchell grass
allowed to go to waste where even a
small percentage would have' provided
fodder for several months during a
drought.
Droughts come as regularly as good
seasons, but as the years advance the
tendency to overstock increases and as a
result pastures fail long before they
should. “Flog the pastures to death”
seems to be the national motto. Security
cannot be any grazier’s lot until water
and fodder are conserved, and if a man
has any chance of doing either he should
get to work on it. It is not inferred that
conservation will give security against
losses in a drought, but it will save some
stock. And an animal saved is one
gained.
Why Burn?
“Burano”: Because it is the easiest way
to get rid of rubbish, burning is con-
stantly done. This is a great mistake
because valuable chemicals are destroyed
in soil that has been subjected to great
heat, the roots of grasses are killed and,
apart from the loss thereby incurred,
erosion by wind and rain is begun, for
nothing holds the topsoil together like
the matted roots of grass.
Instead of burning-off logs and bushes
they should be used to stop gutters and
small creeks. Gravel, sand and soil will
cover the rubbish and will serve to show
just how much of your farm escapes
after a heavy storm. Stone that is
gathered from cultivation paddocks, can
sometimes be used to prevent guttering,
and the planting of trees to replace those
cut should not be neglected. Trees not
only hold the banks of creeks together;
their twigs hold the soil in wet weather
and thus help to form pockets in which
grass-seeds germinate and consolidate the
good work of soil redemption.
Setting a Saw.
“Atlanta”: Although it is possible to
make a first-rate job of the handsaw with
an ordinary pair of fencing pliers, it pays
to use one of the saw-setting devices de-
signed for the purpose. The object of
setting is to make the edge of the saw
slightly wider than the back, thus per-
mitting the teeth to run freely in the cut.
When buying a cross-cut select one whose
back is ground thinner than the toothed
edge. Such a saw will require little set.
Use of a moderately heavy saw will
eliminate much hard work, as weight of
the blade will provide all the pressure
necessary in driving it through the log.
Teeth must not be set at their bases, as
this will cause hard running or jamming
and may crack the blade. Type of saw
and the work for which it is used will
determine the degree of set required. With
wet or green timber more set is needed
than for dry timber. If your cross-cut
jams in tree or log don’t jerk or lever it
out or the set will be ruined. Chop it
free with the axe or open the saw cut by
driving in a wedge.
Slight cracks in a blade may be arrested
by drilling a small hole at the end of the
fissure, but the cracked circular-saw
blade must be discarded at once. Saws
which have rusted through disuse should
be sandpapered lightly to ensure free
running. The sharp saw which receives
regular attention will require less set
than the one which has been allowed to
become dull.
D.D.T. and Codim Moth.
“Bogan Joe”: N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture has been experimenting with
D.D.T. spray for control of codlin moth,
and results so far have given great
promise. The spray at a concentration
of 0.1 p.c. gave outstanding results on
Granny Smith and Jonathan apples
compared with lead arsenate and 0.1 p.c.
“666.” The average infestation of
Jonathans and Grannys respectively
was 1.2 and 2.7 in the D.D.T. spray
plots, 11.4 and 16.3 in the lead-arsenate
plots and 49.4 and 59.6 p.c. in the “666”
plots. Over 90 p.c. of the infested fruit
sprayed with “666” had entered through
the calyx. Red mite caused heavy in-
festation on the D.D.T. plots, and was
controlled by one application of wettable
sulphur early in January. Red mites did
not affect the lead arsenate or the “666”
plots. Further investigations are scheduled
before the use of D.D.T. spray can be
recommended.
Mating Poultry.
“Bennie”: Ten hens Should be mated
with a male in the light breeds such as
Leghorns and Minorcas, while six hens
is the limit for one male in the heavier
breeds. Some poultry men class Rhode
-Island Reds and Australorps as light
' breeds, but it’s better to regard them as
heavies for mating. Wyandottes are poor
breeders.
Should fertility be poor give the male
bird an additional feed daily away from
the hens. A gallant bird will spend a lot
of time seeing that his mates get fed
properly, and whilst doing this he is not
getting sufficient for himself. Another
method is to remove the male from the
breeding pen on two days of the week,
during which he can rest and devour
extra feed —particularly greenstuff.
Where flock mating is practised in light
breeds, allow ten males to a hundred
hens ; it is an advantage to dub roosters
which have large, single combs. At all
times breeding stock require the best of
food, plenty of it, and as much green
feed as they can eat. This produces
healthy chickens.
Soil Renewal.
“Ager”: A Maitland (N.S.W.) potato
grower who gets two crops a year from
the same land renovates the soil with
Japanese millet, forcing the millet by
irrigation, and then ploughing it in for
green manure.
Jap millet is not worried by weed-
growth. It will grow on most soils —
even on a poor soil with its surface fed
with cow manure. Seeding rate is about
71b. to the acre for broadcasting, varying
according to soil type. Some advocate
sowing in drills so as to be able to culti-
vate between rows should the ground
cake. It can be sown as late as January.
Should the crop not do so well it pays
to feed off for a second growth. Take
care to loosen up soil, after stock have

Hints for the Farm.
“Big Billy”; Best results in dairying
will come from hay cut early and cured
in such a way that most of its leaves and
green color are retained. Such hay con-
tains more protein, less fibre, more caro-
tenes, more leaves and fewer stems than
poor hay, is softer and more palatable.
Mineral content of green-cured hay is
more completely used than that of hay
discolored through exposure to moisture.
Although legume hays are usually
superior to the non-legumes in protein
content and mineral matter, and also in
palatability, much depends upon the
soil which grew them and the way they
have been made. A grass-hay from a
soil rich in lirne and phosphorus cut
early and nicely cured is superior in some
respects to legume hay.
“Prof”: The effective sterilisation of
everything with which milk comes in
contact in any dairy is essential in
combating mastitis and securing highest
prices for dairy products. By far the
most economical steriliser is a solution of
a hypochloride powder now sold under
a number of trade-names. We have
found that the increased profit for one
single week pays for sufficient of the
chemical to last a couple of years.
“Sundowner”: One half-grain tablet of
arecoline hydrobromide, dissolved in two
tablespoons of water, and given in doses
varying from one teaspoonful for pups
and small dogs up to two-four tablespoons
for large dogs, will remove the' hydatid
tapeworm. For best results overnight
starvation is necessary. Chain the dog up
immediately after treatment and keep it
thus for some hours until the effects of
the drug have passed off. The patient
should be kept on a hard surface to en-
able the collection of all faeces. Treat-
ment should be applied every eight
weeks. Avoid the feeding of raw offal.
“Heresone”: When a kerosene-lamp
starts to overheat and smoke, the air-
holes are probably choked with soot and
grease. Take out all burner parts and
scrub with an old toothbrush, using hot
water and a good dairy cleanser. Dry
and reassemble and the lamp will burn
like new.
“F.L.”: In the moderate summers and
good rainfall of n.-e. Victoria we regard
Epicure climbing beans as the most
flavorsome and prolific of French beans.
Picking the crop on stakes is not so back-
breaking as when dwarf beans are grown.
The trouble of getting stakes may be
overcome by growing sweet corn on
which the beans climb ; good crops may
be had from both.
“Lub”: Leeks do best in very rich
soil, in a trench about a foot deep. A
layer of surface soil enriched with stable
manure or compost and blood and bone
should be spread on the bottom and the
seedlings transplanted from boxes. As
the plants grow fill up the trench with
rich soil and water frequently. Seed
should be sown in early spring.
“Gzob”; As soon as pumpkins, cucum-
bers, marrows and squashes have a good
start give them a top-dressing of fresh soil
or some well-decayed sieved manure.
When applied, press down firmly all over
the soil where the surface roots are show-
ing. Unnecessary roots will rot quickly
and the feeding areas of the plant will be
considerably increased,
“Billjim”: The dew-claw of dogs is
usually found on /the inner side of the
hind paw and should be removed or
shortened if it becomes abnormally long,
as it causes lameness. Cutting forceps or
strong scissors will easily cut the claw in
pups. If they are examined when a week
old the operation can be performed with
a minimum of pain.
“E.V.S.”: A putty can be made by
mixing very fine slack lime with coal tar
to the required consistency, but it is
essential that the lime be flour fine. This
putty sets hard, and the surplus can be
rendered soft by carefully heating in a
vessel submerged in boiling water. It
has no superior for borer or toredo in
boat-hulls or underwater jobs.
“Myrrhee”: Unless they’re given a
stimulant to maintain rapid growth, leaf
crops are likely to run to seed. A weak
liquid manure can be made from artificial
nitrogenous fertilisers sulphate of
ammonia or nitrate of soda or
manures. Dissolve loz. of the artificial
manures in 4gal. water or soak 21b. or
31b. of animal manure per gallon of water
for at least 24 hours. Apply only after
the soil has been thoroughly watered.
“Atlanta”: A heavy 6in. iron ring
securely fastened to wall or post at the
head of a bail is indispensible when break-
ing-in the heifers. The rope used should
be long enough to run through the ring
and then double back behind the cow.
Alternative to the ring is a large steel
pulley-block, which makes easy running
for the rope.
“Mr.”: For body lice in poultry, run
a thin trail of nicotine sulphate (40 p.c.)
along the perches just as the birds are
going to roost. Choose a calm, warm
evening, and apply the liquid from a tin
with a small hole punched in the bottom.
This won’t kill the head lice, which can
be dealt with the next day by an insecti-
cidal dust.
“Xob33”: Salt is essential for chickens
and reduces the cost of feeding. Chicks
that are fed without salt require 7oz.
of feed to put on loz. body weight. By
adding 1 p.c. salt to the feed the amount
required tp gain the same weight will
be 4ioz. of food; thus a reduction of
2jOZ. in every chicken’s diet, which
amounts to something by the time the
chicks are reared.
“E.M.R.”: For profits from eggs, fowls
must be well- but not over-fed. Merely
feed sufficient in the morning to keep
them alert all day; they will then for-
age for themselves. Inactivity from
overfeeding produces a sort of liverish
boredom. But send them to roost with
well-filled crops.

"I Put It to You, Mate"
By F. L. COMBS
TIM CARSWELL did not stand high
in Paka Puki’s esteem. He was not
a “solid” man.
Yet, using such materials as lay
to his hand, Tim was a poet. At least,
he saw life through a romantic haze
and, when one enterprise collapsed under
him, set out on another. His steady
occupation—none too steady, by the by
—was undertaking.
He had a competitor and only during
epidemics did both thrive. Tim felt that
ours were one-horse funerals and was
eager to give them more tone. For a
month or two he was in possession of an
up-to-date hearse but then it vanished.
It was through letting myself be en-
gaged to keep Tim’s books that I got
to know him really well. I would turn
up in the lean-to behind his shop and
workshop and reach for the day-book
kept on a shelf piled with dusty “immor-
telles.” Tim became impatient under
my questioning. He had an unpleasant
habit (though a pleasant man) of feeling
it necessary to get very close to you in
order to drive his ideas home. His ideas
he punctuated with two stock allocutions,
“I put it to you, mate,” and “Don’t you
think so, friend?”
My first evening in the lean-to he
unfolded his plan to put undertaking in
the township on a vastly improved foot-
ing.
“An up-to-date hearse and one of
these gadgets with a motor that lowers
the coffin gradually and silently—l put
it to you, mate; don’t you think so,
friend? It would pay hands down.
“Then there’s embalming—a science
nowadays. [He had just skipped through
a book on embalming.] But I can’t get
the bank to back me. The fact is—l put
it to you, mate —there isn’t room foi
Bob Moggridge and myself in the game.
Competition lowers the tone of under-
taking—l put it to you, mate —doesn’t
it make it too much on a par with body-
snatching?”
Tim’s other ideas showed vision. There
were to be a mortuary parlor and cold-
storage vaults, and a garden and floral
tributes as a highly profitable sideline.
“The town would benefit and a man
ought to do what he can for his town.
Don’t you think so, friend?”
I took the day-books home and, using
a sort of divination, did the best I could
to get out the accounts.
FOR all his imagination Tim’s funerals
were confused. There was apt to be
running round at the last minute to
attend to solemn details that had been
overlooked.
Moreover, Tim could not get it out
of his head that the bereaved needed
cheering up. Once he obviously went
too far. It was when he told the widow
Grendler that she was too bright and
capable a woman to remain long in her
widowed state. There was, he remarked,
many a good tune played on an old
fiddle.
And he said to Harry Park, “After all,
Harry, the old boy [Harry’s parent] had
reached a stage where he couldn’t enjoy
his food and by all we’re told he’s cut
up well.” As Harry’s own thoughts were
in keeping with this remark, Tim got
away with it. But his fellow-feeling lost
him many funerals.
During the great ’flu epidemic I was
a sort of clerk-cnm-rouseabout at the
Town Hall —a temporary hospital—and
I gained a good deal of insight into the
undertaking. There was jostling for pre-
cedence when it came to the interment
of Vigors, the well-heeled owner of a
thousand acres and a splendid dairy herd,
a piece of business I was able to put Tim’s
way. On the other hand, when the job
was the burying of the last of the im-
pecunious McNattys, the saturnine Mog-
gridge took me aside and said, “Let
Carswell have Bill, Tom. It’s only a
fair pop. I’ve already planted Ike and
Jim.”
~rTM’S undertaking work became more
1 and more sketchy. He embarked, full
of hope, on the secondhand business.
Someone (not the bank) did back him
this time, and soon his mart was full of
junk of all kinds. For a time he throve;
his brightness was more in keeping with
an auction mart than a cemetery.
His sympathetic desire to do his best
for his clients made him rather more
mendacious than most auctioneers. His
assurance that an ancient piano was the
sort of instrument they didn’t make these
days and his eulogies of a battered and
colossal baroque sideboard which looked
like a wrecked galleon were persuasively
effective and quitted the latter to a couple
who on taking it home couldn’t get it
into their dining-room.
He also made his premises a meat-
mart and fish-mart. As a fishmonger he
had the usual trouble with the weather.
But all the time, alas, a serpent was
gnawing at Tim’s vitals. Mrs. Carswell
was a solitary drinker, given to strange
aberrations. I have seen her, a pale
woman with% set, dead look in her face,
walking rapidly’over the sandhills in the
darkness.
I have also seen her neat and cheerful
in a Mother Hubbard apron, tidying up
the mart; which needed it. This was
when she was “off it,” and at such times
her husband’s natural buoyancy of spirits
mounted to a *new height. But things
took a turn for the worse when Mrs.
Carswell entered into a liaison with a
visiting bridge carpenter. Then she re-
vealed herself as a “woman who did not
care,” who was dead to all shame, or
who, maybe, found Paka Puki a hell out
of which she had ceased to hope for
redemption.
I had by this time become an adept in
keeping Tim’s books; I was also his
confidant. Eager and indignant, yet with
the buoyancy that never deserted him, he
would discourse regarding his troubles.
He had done his best, but there was some-
thing in Nell that couldn’t be cured. Ten
years ago he thought he. had got her off
it with Dr. Boake’s Golden Remedy. She
never touched it for a year. But then
she had broken out again. He knew
what was going on now. No one had
ever told him —they were not likely to
tell you—-“ But I put it to you, mate.
When I come home I find the candlestick
full of cigarette-butts. Not mine or
hers; we roll our own and these are
tailor-mades.”
It seemed a good thing when Mrs.
Carswell took herself off with her bridge
carpenter. Tim never mentioned her and
became .all agog with a new enterprise,
the breeding of bantams, a prize strain.
“Hardy, healthy little birds, the greatest
pets in the world, and great scrappers.
I put it to you, mate, there isn’t anyone
keeps fowls in the Dominion to whom a
man couldn’t sell a pair of bantams.”
But with this enterprise launched Tim
suddenly became deflated, sold himself
up, and left Paka Puki.
CIVE years later I met him again.
1 There had been a monster congress
of my friendly society at Christchurch,
and in a cavalcade of cars half a mile
long we set v off on a jaunt to Akaroa.
There are either a dozen or a score of
small hostels on the road from Christ-
church to Akaroa. I was belated and,
getting into the last car, already crowded,
was given a seat alongside the taxi-man.
He was Tim. He told me he would never
get it, didn’t care a curse what hap-
pened to him now. Her leaving him like
she did had settled him. Though sociable
still, his mien was sombre and he never
once said “I put it to you, mate.”
His passengers proved convivial and
we stopped at every hostel on the way
down. We also stopped at every hostel
on the way back, and there was great
hilarity when, with ten minutes to go to
6 p.m., we started a race against time
for the last inn between us and the City
of the Plains, Tim, nothing loath,
opened her out. When, however, at
sixty miles per hour the car struck a
patch of loose metal and began to sway
and veer it became manifest that his
passengers did not in the least share
Tim’s indifference to our ultimate desti-
nation. The last hostel was reached in
time but not till the steering-wheel had
been placed in safer hands.
I have not met Tim Carswell since.
He has most likely gone the way of all
flesh. If I can find out where he is buried
I would erect a stone to him and have
graved upon it the words “I put it to you,
mate.” Also, remembering his own ways
at interments, I might add “As he was
fed up with things it’s maybe better so”

Rivalry on the Road.
“Charged with driving his ancient jalopy
into 1946 model cars, a Detroit man ‘l
hate people who own new cars.’ ” —“Time
It was when the first streamlined model
appeared on the roads that my 1906 De
Dion Boucicault began to exhibit anti-
sociar tendencies.
I first noticed a subtle malaise when a
green patina began to appear on her
radiator whenever we were overtaken
bv anything opulent-looking. Attribut-
ing this to the ravages of time, I removed
it regularly with nitric acid, but when
the old girl, on passing /a Rolls Royce
going downhill, made an unmistakably
derisive noise with her exhaust I realised
it was jealousy.
She soon took matters into her own
hands. A black-and-silver Mercedes was
slowly passing us one day when the De
Dion wrenched the tiller from me and
sped in pursuit at an unaccustomed 30
m.p.h. She finally pinned the Mercedes
savagely against a telegraph pole, vomited
half a gallon of rusty water over it from
her radiator, then sighed happily and
collapsed.
After her return from the vet.’s I tried
to quieten her down by reducing the
petrol in her mixture from 2Q per cent,
to 10, but it was no use. In a short run
she savaged three new coupes, a vulgarly

ploughing thoughtfully halfway through

That finished her. Though it broke

Too Much for Him.
“Under a proposal by Mr. Calwell, alien
immigrants are to get a happier welcome, are
to be especially educated in the Australian way
of life, and, should they become naturalised,
an impressive ceremony will mark their adoption
of Australian citizenship.”
“You’ve been appointed a committee
of one, Maxie,” said Arthur, “to combine
a grand welcome and some preliminary
instruction to a boatload of our valyerd
immigrants from Central Europe who
are due in today on the s.s. Skrofulus.
It only ’as accommodation for 58, and as
there’s over eight ’undred on board y’d
better take a gasmask along. Now after
y’ pass ’em the glad ’and on be’alf o’
the Guvverment I want y’ to give ’em
a few wrinkles on our way of life ’ere.
“They’ve ’ad a charnce, o’ course, of
learnin’ a good bit about our country
through the D. 0.1. brochures I ’ad sent
to their embarkation point. It explains
everything from Doc, Evatt’s great im-
portance in world affairs to the fact that
bookmakin’ and Guvverment Loan
quizzes ’ave a more vital effect on the
nation’s economy that either wool or
wheat. It also assures ’em there’s plenty
of six-bedroomed ’ouses in the poshest
suburbs available at a rental of seventeen-
bob a week, that silk ’ats for businessmen
can be bought for ten an’ elevenpence,
that Sydney’s an’ Melbin’s ’orse-trams
are the best in the world an’ that there’s
ample ’itchin’-post accommodation in
Martin-place, Collins-street an’ King
William-street.”
“If we’re goin’ to tutor ’em up in our
way of life,” put in Maxie, “hadn’t 1
better first warn them that unless they
join a Commo-led union they won’t be
allowed to work?”
Arthur gazed at his fellow-legislator in
despair.
“You qught to know be now, Maxie,”
he said, "that a reffo never works with
’is ’ands. What earthly use’d a union be
to ’im? They’ll all be openin’ antique
shops an’ backyard clothing sweat
fact’ries, won’t they? No —just oil ’em
up in the way things are ’ere. Tell ’em
somethin’ of our prized culchur —what’s
expected of ’em as citizens.
“FTinstance, when a cop’s gettin’
booted to death be a mob outside a pub
it’s considered crook citizenship to go to
’is assistance. The accepted conduct is
to give the mob a ’and. And if they see
a tremendous crowd, especially if it’s in
Sydney, gettin’ out of ’and they mustn’t
expect to see a V.C. ’ero or a great
national benefactor bein’ wildly ac-
claimed. They’ll ’ave to be prepared to
join the stampede to see the weddin’ of
a second-rate jockey or a gangster’s
funeral. An’ don’t forgit to tell ’em that
in: pretty well every capital city they’ll be
goin’ to —none of ’em, o’ course, will be
goin’ to the country —they’ll be well
catered for with State Guwerment
lott’ries. An’ emphasise that if their
luck’s in like one reffo who’s a newspaper
’ero in Sydney, an’ they can rake in
£20,000 in one year in prizes, the Guv-
verment you represent don’t take a bean
of it, whereas if they earn the same
amount by the sweat of their employees’
brows we’ll sock ’em eighteen an’ six in
the pound tax —unless, o’ course, they
keep two sets o’ books or none at all.
Bjy tellin’ ’em this it’ll be doin’ our
cobbers Billy McKell, Cain, ’Anion, Wise
and Cosgrove a good turn.
“Oh, an’, Maxie, tell ’em about the
ceremony that’ll mark their naturalisation.
It’ll be impressive. They’ll ’old a mort-
gage carryin’ three ’undred per cent,
int’rest in one hand while they give a loud
‘Oy! Oy!’ at the same time wipin’
their boots on the Union Jack. Then
they’ll bow in deep obeisance before a
photo, of a ninety-thousand quid block of
King’s Cross flats. Now y’ better git
goin’ an’ meet the ship.”
Less than an hour later the Minister
for looked up in surprise as
Maxie came back and threw down his
hat in disgust.
“Surely you ’aven’t” began Arthur.
“What a mob you brought this time! ”
Maxie growled. “Just in case they vos
interested I took along a few votches an’
chains, but before I could open my gob
about two hundred reffos swarmed
around trying to sell me some! You can
get someone else for the job.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

This Private Enterprise
I am a country storekeeper, 80 miles
by road from Perth, and the stupid Gov-
ernment railway strike involved me in a
good deal of extra work. Fortunately, I
have my own truck, and was able to
bring several tons of general goods from
the distracted metropolis.
Groping my way round the piled-up
warehouses by lantern- or candle-light,
shoving and hauling cases and bundles
in company with harassed dispatch men
of various firms, I was once more
amazed at the resilience and toughness
of this private enterprise of ours. To
one elderly man who had been going
flat out since early morning trying to
sort out orders for the country I said,
“Why don’t you fellows go out on strike,
too? You*’ve got every justification.”
He laughed grimly. “Yes, I suppose we
should, but we’ve got to carry on and
do a job.” It was evident that he did
not give the matter serious thought.
Later, loaded up from several different
points and headed home, I noted the
continuous stream of trucks of all vin-
tages all flowing steadily in and out of
the metropolitan area. They carried in
livestock, milk, empty drums, produce
and timber ; they loaded farm machinery,
foodstuffs, fuel and goods of all kinds
on the outward trips. One was aware
of grimy men with two or three days’
growth of beard, tired and dizzy after
long hours punching the steering wheel.
The number-plates indicated that they
came from Albany and points south of
Perth, from the wheat-belt and from
the north.
No doubt most of these men were
making money, but the main thing was
that they were doing something, and
doing it fast.
You could hear, the put-put-putter of
emergency lighting-plants in shops, fac-
tories and all manner of strange estab-
lishments —I saw and heard .a rakish-
looking exhaust pipe clamoring from
the second-storey window of a dancing
academy. Many picture-theatres had
their own plants. Lamps, candles and
torches were used, and one executive had
two telephone cells wired up in series
with a torch globe bent over his papers.
The service-station I visited had rigged
up an emergency compressor unit to run
the hoist so that we could get a grease-
up. On all sides individual effort was
abundantly evident.
I thought, “When all these people go
on strike we’ll see a real strike!” A
muddled thought, but something was
nagging at me. The set-up was crazy.
A “nationalised” railway service, “be-
longing” to the people, was helpless with
rusty rails and deserted yards. The
people were working all hours and suf-
fering all manner of losses and expense
to keep the community going.
I suppose the striking unionist and the
salaried union official, when they return
home after a wordy battle in the commit-
tee room or court, expect to find the good
wife with a nice three-course meal laid
out, smokes handy if possible, and all
manner of things. But who actually
makes these things available? Private
enterprise, of course —the “evil” they are
fighting —R. H. G. (W.A.).
Car Prices
I’ve just narrowly avoided a six-
months’ stretch for blackmarketing.
Having a small English car for sale, I
saw the firm from whom I’d bought it
as a 1940 model. “Right,” said the
manager. “We’ll give you a cheque
immediately for the N.S.P. figure, £212.”
He showed me the authorised list.
I had to delay the transaction for a
few weeks and meanwhile asked the
Prices Commissioner just where I stood.
His reply was, “You are advised that
from the chassis number your car is a
1939 model; the maximum price is fixed
by Prices Regulation Order No. 2039
(as amended) at £180.”
I dropped over £3O on the deal,
although the firm insisted that all these
cars were sold as 1940 models, and was
ready to repurchase on that basis. But
if I’d gone ahead In the first place and
closed on the transaction I’d have been
in the soup.— Tamar (Tas.).
‘‘Sufficient Reason”
I have just seen another and more
painful indication of the condition of
the Commonwealth electoral rolls (B.
20/11/’46). It is a form headed “Com-
monwealth of Australia, State of Vic-
toria, Division of , Indi, Subdivision o
Tatura,” with the official title of “Noti
fication to Elector who appears to hav
Failed to Vote.”
Thereafter the document states:
To the elector whose name and address
appear on the back hereof: You are
notified that you appear to have failed to
vote at the election of Members of the
Senate for the said State, held under the
Commonwealth Electoral Act on Saturday,
the 28th September, 1946, and you are
hereby called upon, in pursuance of Sec-
tion 128 a Of the said Act, to give a valid,
truthful, and sufficient reason why you
failed so to vote.
You are required to—(a) state, in the
form at the foot of this notice, the true
reason why you failed so to vote; (b)
complete- and personally sign the form,
and have it witnessed by an elector or a
person qualified to be an elector; (c) fold
the form so that the address “Common-
wealth Divisional Returning Officer for the
Division of Indi” shall be visible and post
it so as to reach me on or before Decem-
ber 4, 1946.
The form is “signed” with the stamp
of the Divisional Returning Officer and
dated November 12, 1946. It was re-
ceived by the mother of the “Elector
Who Faded to Vote.” Her son gave
his life for his country on July 24, 1944.
—Oliver Filter (N.S.W.),
The R.S.L.
Anyone who barges into this League
controversy should introduce himself, so
here it is: I was rejected as medically
unfit by the R.A.N. and the R.A.A.F. and
eventually enlisted in the Armored Div.
When that show looked like taking root
in N. S. Wales I had another lash at the
R.A.A.F. and, after five attempts and
four minor operations, finally made air
crew. In a matter of weeks I was irre-
vocably scrubbed to ground staff as medi-
cally unfit for flying. In the course of the
next two or three years I got around quite
a bit. I was on large stations and small,
on both operational and administrative
units and sundry headquarters, including
the beaut, in Melbourne. I lived and
worked with ground staff, did the same
with air crews and went with them on a
few operational flips over the islands. I
held a commission for about one-third
of the time that I didn’t.
I’m not trying to “blow” or excuse my-
self—my “record” was remarkably un-
distinguished, I was never shot at and
the only bomb that ever fell near me
was unloaded by a clumsy old Mavis,
fell at a very safe distance and turned
out to be a dud anyway. The only point
I want to make is that I’ve mixed with a
fair cross-section of service types.
When I was bowler-hatted I was given
an R.A.S. badge and, as I walked out of
the building, the representatives of three
ex-servicemen’s associations were waiting
to offer me any or all of three more
badges. The R.S.L. desk was set a little
apart from the other two, and the three
of them were so placed that you had to
pass from the R.S.L. to the Air Force
Association and thence to the Australian
Legion of Ex-servicemen —an arrange-
ment which immediately reminded me
of Lawson’s “Wait Here, Second-Class.”
That attitude has been maintained and
developed sufficiently in the League to
give it a nasty, almost dangerous jolt
when it elected to widen its ranks. It is
a most un-Australian form of snobbery,
and those who adopt it leave themselves
open to the charge of being as keen to
advertise that they saw front-line combat
as they are anxious not to be mistaken
for or associated with those who didn’t.
They are also inviting reflections on the
old Digger tradition that those who did
most talk least. There is no reason why
ex-servicemen who want to hold .and
foster old and tried friendships should not
do it within the League—and retain the
honest respect and admiration of the men
who, through no fault of their own, did
not reach a “front line.”
What the dissentients from the League’s
policy don’t realise is that the kinship
that they are anxious to nourish is not
based so much on overseas or front-line
experience but on the character and
quality of the men who volunteered for
it —whether they got there or not. One
ex-servicemen’s association I know is a
small, informal one in the local pub.
Its members include a D. 5.0., a D.F.C.,
an ex-p.-0.-w.. an orderly-room sergeant,
“I started off in a small Way with goldfish!”
a R.A.A.F. fitter and a radio expert
whose technical knowledge and skill kept
him permanently pinned in Sydney.
They’re all good types and they’ve enough
in common, and enough character and
commonsense, to be neither critical nor
envious of what the others did between
1939 and 1945. That kind of relationship
could and should be the binding strength
of the R.S.L.
The other bogey raised by the critics is
that the league’s expansion will admit a
flood of draft-dodgers and other con-
firmed shinies. From a fairly wide ex-
perience of units on the Australian main-
land I know those specimens are com-
paratively few. They are poor types,
admitted, but there are so many equally
poor among those who did find their way
overseas. Neither variety, although ad-
mitted to a League embracing all volun-
teers, would achieve the essential member-
ship based on mutual respect and com-
radeship.
r Ninety-five per cent, of volunteers,
however, whether they saw combat or not,
are f.a.q. Australians with enough in
common to belong to and support one
ex-servicemen’s outfit. Inevitably they
will form into their little cliques just as
they did in camp, whether in Australia
or Africa, but the cliques will be held to-
gether more by ordinary human qualities
than by service records. And it should
be apparent to the most clueless clot that
ex-servicemen will be better represented
when and if all their minor coteries are
banded together behind the solid front
of one organisation—the League. Those
who form small select groups outside in
the belief that they are maintaining some
special form of kinship neglected by the
League are only achieving a snobbish
isolation and whittling down the reputa-
tion and strength of the institution best
qualified to guard their interests. — Bul-
lengro (N.S.W.).
The Cotton Bounty
» The Federal Government’s Cotton
Bounty Bill gave a guarantee of a mini-
mum price of 15d. a pound for raw cot-
ton for the next five years. That is
equivalent to sld. a pound seed cotton,
which, on paper, seems to be just what
the doctor ordered for Queensland cot-
ton-growers. Upper Burnett and Daw-
son planters, however, hold different
views. The extra penny a pound cer-
tainly doesn’t make up for higher pro-
duction costs —costs have increased by
approximately 25 per cent, in the last five
years.
The cotton industry can only be placed
on a sound footing by a guaranteed mini-
mum price of at least 6d. a pound for
seed cotton; by a first-class irrigation
scheme; by lower machinery costs and
by some sort of a monetary scheme en-
abling planters to be cbmpensated after
crop failures. As things are now cotton-
growing in Queensland is such a gamble
that men with suitable country prefer to
stick to dairying, small-crop farming and
pig-raising.
If the Commonwealth Government
were to remove the element of gamble
from cotton-growing the present acreage
would be trebled within three years.
‘Guaranteed higher prices” certainly
won’t lower production costs. The days
of “scrub” cotton have practically given
way to “plantation” cotton, which de-
mands the use of machinery, oil and
petrol. And wear and tear on machinery,
as well as higher wages, must be met.
Country that was cleared and carried
cotton for a year or two is now grazing
land for dairy and beef cattle. A
guaranteed price of s£d. a pound for seed
cotton certainly won’t encourage the
dairy-farmer to plough up dairying land
and plant cotton-butter cheques arrive
from the factory at the end of every
month, but for the cotton-planter the
“ghost walks with lean and hungry
steps.” During a drought, when the dairy-
farmer receives small cheques at least,
the cotton-planter usually loses every-
thing.—R. C, (Q.).
Australian Actors
I see that Actors’ Equity is up in arms
against E. J. Tait for saying that Aus-
tralian actors and actresses, including
ballet dancers, are lazy and won’t do their
best unless they are supported by im-
ported artists.
Mr. Tait should know. During 20 years
of casting a professional eye over his
productions from in front of the foot-
lights I can remember few plays in
which Australian actors didn’t have to
play with imported artists, the latter
usually holding all the portfolios of any
importance. Sometimes Australian artists
who played subordinate roles in Aus-
tralia went abroad and then returned to
star parts with an international reputa-
tion. Audiences are snobs, and I don’t
suppose anybody knows that better than
Mr. Tait.
But there is no reason to believe that
Australian actors are any lazier than im-
ported artists. I constantly see in the
amateur field in Melbourne all-Australian
casts putting on performances superior
to Mr. Tail’s productions. In better plays,
too, generally speaking.— Cauboy (Vic.).
Australian Fishing Industries
Although exceptionally well named to
tackle the subject, H. I. Bate, M.L.A.,
made a doubtful cast when he attacked
the concern called Australian Fishing In-
dustries in the N. S. Wales Legislative
Assembly.
I don’t know much about the ins and
outs of business, but I have been to
Eden (N.S.W.) and seen just what A.F.I.
is doing there. It would pay Mr. Bate
to make an inspection, too. He would
find a hive of young industry. A.F.I. has
begun an entirely new venture, and in
time will be processing fish for shipment
wherever it is needed. I| has gone about
the job in a businesslikelmanner: set up
its offices and freezing works right on
the water’s edge at Twofold Bay and
almost completed a wharf to which the
trawlers may bring their catch.
Most important from the fisherman’s
point of view is that he is paid for the
fish as it is unloaded at the jetty. Col-
lecting the current price for his catch he
can depart unworried by the thought of
losing money, as he did before, when the
onus of looking after a very perishable
cargo was on him. >
A.F.I. has also built a convenient boat-
building yard where any trawler may be
slipped to have the barnacles scraped off
or the engine serviced. Previously they
had to make the trip to Sydney, and, in a
small-sized craft with a faulty engine,
that was no child’s play.
And A.F.I. is housing employees. Cot-
tages are springing up with the other
mushrooms on Eden Headland.
Although still in its early stages, the
company should soon reach full produc-
tion. When it does it will no doubt be
able to process even such red-herrings as
Mr. Bate brings into the House. Dino-
saur (N.S.W*)-
Writers and Tax
Reading “C.S.’s” sad story of what the
Taxation Department did to his hard-
earned income from writing (B.
20/ll/’46), I recalled that in the N.T.
“primary producers” are exempted from
income tax to assist and encourage them
in developing the country.
Surely the field of Australian literature
is as vast and undeveloped—and as im-
portant—as the Territory, and surely it
requires an equal amount of toil and
sweat to make a living from it. Why,
then, can’t income from books, short
stories, plays, and paintings for that
matter, be shielded from the taxgatherer’s
itchy palm? In the long run the exemp-
tion would probably be cheaper and
more productive than Commonwealth
Literary Fund grants—where, incidentally,
is the logic in handing one writer £2OO to
write a book, and then reefing £2OO off
another'after he’s written one?
There would be intricacies and some
fine points to be decided, I know, but
surely they could be overcome by a Gov-
ernment as experienced as ours in fram-
ing complicated regulations, and then
finding or plugging loopholes in them. —

Capital Punishment
Whence comes political Labor s
opposition to capital and corporal
punishment? The average Labor man
is no less in favor of violent punishment
for violent wrongdoers than is his
counterpart in the Liberal party, yet all
“Labor” Governments oppose such salu-
tary treatment. , , .
In S.A. recently not only have two
ruffians been sentenced to the lash (B.
j3/H/’46) but another has been exe-
cuted. In Westralia a jury sentenced a
voung man to death for murdering a de-
tective in cold blood. Even if the West s
“Labor” Government opposes the noose
it is to be hoped that some considera-
tion will be given to the police, who,
more than any other section of the com-
munity, must be protected from these
wild beasts posing as men.’ — Dutigalla
(Vic.).
Binghi and Liquor
The old N. S. Wales Liquor Act (Sec-
tion 49) provided that a licensee under
the Act should not supply, give or sell
liquor to an aboriginal native of Aus-
tralia, except in case of sickness or acci-
dent. “Aboriginal native” was defined as
a full-blood, or any person having ap-
parently an admixture of aboriginal
blood who was in receipt of rations from
the Aborigines Board, or who was re-
siding on a reserve.
This provision was deleted from the
amended Act which recently became law,
and public meetings have been held at
nearly all towns where there are abo.
reserves protesting against the deletion.
Questioned about it in the N. S. Wales
Assembly, the Chief Secretary, Mr. Bad-
deley, said that there was ample provision
in the Aborigines Protection Act to pre-
vent the sale or supply of liquor to abos.
What he did not mention was that a
circular dated November 1, 1946, and
issued to the police contained the fol-
lowing paragraph:
In accordance with the wishes of the
Chief Secretary police are instructed to
refrain from taking any action under Sec-
tion 9 of the Aborigines’ Protection Act,
1909.
Section 9 of the A.P. Act is the only
section in that Act which prohibits the
sale, supply or giving of liquor to an
aborigine!
The removal of the prohibition of the
supply of liquor to the abos is one of the
most wicked things ever done by the
Government. Binghi has not the physical
or moral fibre to withstand the effects of
alcohol. Fortunately most publicans are
refusing to serve them, but the refusal
will pause trouble one of these days. And
there are some publicans who will not
hesitate to unload “plonk” on colored
customers. — Macßopus (N.S.W.).
Informal Votes
“Dutigalla” (B. 30/10/’46) is right
when he says the cure for informal votes
is education, but he’s wrong in expecting
immigrants to be ignorant of our voting
procedure. I have acted for 25 years on
the electoral staff in a Melbourne sea-
side suburb which is now heavily popu-
lated with refugees. The great majority
of them* not only know how to vote but
are also aware of the value attaching to
a vote —a thing that the average Aus-
tralian does not appreciate.
The education suggested by “D.” should
not only cover how to vote, but also
why. If every Australian boy and girl
knew the history of the struggle to ob-
tain adult franchise they might treat it
with the importance it deserves. Inci-
dentally, I’ve found that the most
ignorant voters are people of 35 and up,
while those recording their first vote do
seem to know a little about the business. —
Don (Vic.).
Riches
Today I sat on a form in North-terrace,
Adelaide, feeling bored and fed-up gener-
ally. Presently I was joined by an old
chap who looked far from being pros-
perous, but just as far from being down-
hearted. Together we watched the river
of traffic flowing by, banked on one side
by handsome business premises and on
the other by magnificent institutions.
Everywhere were evidences of wealth,
with never a hint of penury.
After remarking on the perfect weather
I asked my companion if he didn’t feel
envious of the swanks passing in their
shining limousines. “Why should I?” he
answered brightly. “I own most of this
side of the street.” I just smiled and said
“Is that so?”
“Yes,” he went on. “There’s the read-
ing-room, where they keep all the papers
of the Commonwealth filed for me. Then
in the Museum I have the finest collec-
tion of curiosities and scientific speci-
mens money can buy. If I’m puzzled by
any of the exhibits the Library next door
gives me all the information I need, with
the attendants ready to help me. In the
Art Gallery I have all my old favorites
as well as the moderns. And the Botani-
cal Gardens are kept in good nick for me
all the year round. If I don’t own this
side of North-terrace I’d like to know
who does! ” — Samson (S.A.).
Tourists
Wherever a lone store and pub huddle
for company beside a bush track a-
progress association sooner or later cries
the need for encouraging tourists. First,
improvements are essential. Pot-holes
the cockie has bumped through for years
must be filled. His money must be used
for tree-planting, camp-sites and parks.
New roads must be made to the trout
stream where hitherto he could always
depend on an uninterrupted stretch of
water and a decent catch to supplement
the larder.
Soon the pub enlarges ite premises,
and, pandering to the tastes of better-
paying guests, the proprietor discourages
the shabby local, who finds, when the
flush of tourists is gone, that the district’s
beer ration has also departed. At the
store he learns that supplies are short,
and sees his monthly tobacco ration re-
duced. Homeward bound along the
tourist road his rates have built, he dis-
covers fences sagging, gates left open and
his stock losing condition because of a
noisy party camped at the one drink-
ing place.
During the holiday season he lives in
constant fear of fires, and, keeping an eye
on the danger zones, he is too busy to
guard the orchard he has planted down
by the creek. So, after a year of spray-
ing, pruning and tending, he probably
finds his fruit-trees raided, broken limbs
and a trail of unripe fruit bearing mute
testimony to reckless handling.
Maybe I am biased. Maybe I haven’t
yet seen the colossal advantages these
tourists bring to a district. —C. E. (Vic.).
Democracy
As an ideology it is glorious. As prac-
tical politics it must often make the angels
weep by reversing the laws of logic and
ignoring the lessons of history. In Aus-
tralia, politicians who have been sacked
by their constituencies at home are re-
warded for their failure by being sent to
represent their nation overseas. The old
order changeth. It used to be “loved at
home; revered abroad.” “Rejected at
home” is the new order of precedence. —
Gilbert (S.A.).
Bushfire Control in Victoria
The article on “Bushfires” (B.
20/11/ ’46) reads strangely to one with a
first-hand knowledge of the facts. The
Country Fire Authority which has oper-
ated in Victoria since April 2, 1945, is
the authority recommended in Judge
Stretton’s report. He did not advocate
an “overriding” authority (whatever that
may mean), and the provision of finance,
which he*was not asked to investigate, is
the principal addition by legislation to
the recommendations in his much-quoted,
little-read and less-understood report.
For so much as it is worth, arrange-
ments have been made to clean out small
dams on the creek near Belgrave. This
is a township which sadly needs a re-
ticulated water supply, without which fire
brigades can perform no miracles, but
the absence of suitable catchments will
involve pumping a supply from lower
levels. An elaborate system has been
planned. It will not be carried out until
work in the State considered even more
urgent is completed.
As to less being done than in another
year, more has been done by this
Authority in 18 months than was done
for 20 years previously. We know most
of the “experienced country firemen,” but
the Belgrave incident was not the out-
come of experience. As for the statement
that there are similar situations in other
parts of Victoria there is no similar situ-
ation in any other part of Victoria.
In this particular case, fire prevention
has become involved with local municipal
politics, and, whilst it is quite clear from
which side of the fence your correspon-
dent has been informed, there is (of
course), another and most interesting side
to that argument also. —(G. G. Sinclair,
A.1.C.A., J.P., secretary. Country Fire
Authority.)
Classrooms
Control of epidemics of measles,
chickenpox and mumps by germ-killing
ultra-violet ray lamps in classrooms is
being tried on an experimental basis over-
seas. The lamps are made of a special
kind of glass which permits the ultra-
violet wavelengths to pass through.
Trough fixtures protect the children from
direct rays and so prevent “sunburn.”
Disinfection of the air depends on its
circulation into the upper section of the
room.
Contrast this with the dingy, damp,
unhealthy, hopelessly overcrowded build-
ings in which a large number of Aus-
tralian children are taught. Add the lack
of equipment, refusal of the Education
Department to instal such things as public-
address systems, small picture projectors
and the like, and it becomes a wonder
that the harassed schoolteacher hasn’t
taken a leaf out of the miners’ and
wharfies’ book.— Virgo (N.S.W.).
Frustrated Needlewoman
Many women who afe passably handy
with the needle are leading frustrated
lives just now because of the shortage of
floral cotton-piece goods. The onset of
summer means that tub frocks for chil-
dren and themselves must be provided,
but when the material allowed to each
customer is a maximum of four yards
the situation becomes really difficult.
It is galling, after meeting with con-
tinued defeat on the ragshop battlefront,
to walk past shop windows stuffed full
with ready-made children’s frocks at 395.
6d. and upwards, the material for which
would cost Bs. The makers, mostly
foreigners, do not meet with any difficulty
in obtaining adequate supplies of
material, and they are taking advantage
of the situation to soak buyers.—Missus
Barwon (N.S.W.).
J
This Modem Age
“O’Took” (B. 6/11 /’46) believes in the
free distribution of all knowledge, in-
eluding the secret of the atom bomb. To
prove the absurdity of his idea it is only
necessary to imagine what would happen
if the formula of potent drugs were
broadcast and the controls removed.
The secret of atomic energy is now in
safe hands, but make a free gift of it to
the warring factions of India, China and
Palestine and the result would beggar
imagination.
Perhaps “O’Took” had only Russia in
mind, and believes the Soviet rulers are
peace-minded. But even they are mortal
and Russian policy is changeable. In any
case, would Stalin share the dread secret
with Turkey in order to allay the “sus-
picion” of that neighbor? Or would he
keep it in order to ensure that the sus-
picion would remain one-sided instead
of becoming mutual?
“How oft the power to do ill deeds
makes ill deeds done.” To multiply the
atomic power would certainly multiply
the evil deeds in a world where the only
international law still is, “Let him take
who has the power, and let him hold who
can.” — Realist (S.A.).
Scientists and Governments
“O’Took” (B. 6/11 /’46) is needlessly
disturbed by the growing tendency to-
wards specialisation, and by the fact that
“progress is becoming the possession of
a small group.” Progress in all ages has
been made by small groups, sometimes
by individuals in defiance of large groups
—Roger Bacon and Galileo, for instance.
True progress is the work of first-class
men, and Nature is rather niggardly with
her gift of genius.
The increasing tendency towards sped-
alisation is a natural corollary of pro-
gress. The day is past when it could
be said, as was said of Aristotle, that one
mind could encompass the whole of
“You can cut the nursery out, see!”
human knowledge. And it is well for us
that this is so, for if an ordinarily intel-
ligent man could survey the whole of
human knowledge we should be lagging
far behind our possible achievement.
In every age and in every field of
human endeavqr there has been a body
of esoteric knowledge withheld from the
generality of mankind. Whether it be
the making of steel or the smashing of the
atom, the knowledge was acquired by an
individual or a group and, although the
rough outline of the method may be
added to the sum of exoteric knowledge,
the exact details of the process remain
with the few who follow that particular
avenue.
The necessity for specialisation is recog-
nised in every walk of life. What, pro-
fession is there that doesn’t maintain
rigorous standards for its practitioners?
What craft union does not oppose strenu-
ously the admission of “dilutee” labor?
But specialisation, whether to maintain
professional standards or to obtain some
economic advantage, is not necessarily
harmful.
There enters a factor that Emerson
called the law of compensation—“a
specialist is a man who knows more and
more about less and less.” The scientists
who specialist in atomic fission are
specialists in the use of the cyclotron,
but could they build one? Without the
miner, the mill-hand and artisans of many
kinds, the work could not be projected,
far less completed. Deprived of the help
of the farmer and the food-processer,
the scientist would be too concerned with
his stomach to worry about atoms. The
specialist is the most dependent of men.
The queen bee is the ultimate specialist,
and as queen of the hive she is slave of
the swarm.
In his New Atlantis, Francis Bacon
outlines an ideal civilisation. In his
imaginary land is Solomon’s House, “the
noblest foundation that ever was upon
the earth,” devoted to “the enlarging of
the bounds of human empire.” Those
who control the activities of the college
decide what inventions shall be_published,
which shall be concealed from the people
and even those which shall be concealed
from the State. Bacon, himself a venal
official, knew well what to expect from
Governments. He saw very clearly that
the greatest potential enemy of any
people is that people’s own Government,
Whether for good or ill it was a Car-
eminent that unleashed atomic power in
warfare. The scientists, the specialists
who devised the bomb, had no part in the
decision and, I suspect, had more interest
in the immediate effect of the explosion
than in the ultimate effect. Had the Gov-
ernments concerned not wanted to un-
press another Government, the scientists
would have longed in vain for the money
and labor necessary to carry out their re-
search. And now every Government that
can afford it, and some that cannot, are
lavishing money on atomic research in
the hope that their scientists too will
produce a nice loud bang. But the fault
lies with the dilettantism of Governments
rather_ than with the specialisation of the
scientists. Ichabod Crane (N.S.W.).
Lights
street f rame
When is Sydney going to save the time
of policemen urgently needed tor other
<jvork by installing traffic lights at all
street intersections? It is a ridiculous
waste of manpower for a healthy cop to
spend his days standing in the middle of
a street directing traffic when there are so
many criminals and rackets to be dealt
with. _ T ,, ,
While on the traffic lights, 1 d suggest
the New York scheme, where all the lights
on the avenues, which run north and
south, switch on simultaneously Lne
cross-streets are similarly controlled, tne
system speeds up traffic, and woe betiae
the pedestrian who crosses a street against
the lights—the motorist who does not
give way is completely protected against
jay-walkers. 4
Admittedly, New York does not have
outmoded trams in its main streets, but,
in spite of the amount of traffic, there is
little, if any, congestion such as we put
up with in Sydney,— Wilydah (N.S.W.).

J.FJ. Radiolette
And no wonder, for in addition to being the
product of a great wireless organisation,
the new Radiola brings you outstanding
tonal reproduction and performance.
The Company’s laboratories are the finest
equipped and staffed in Australia. The
A. W. A. Radio-Electric Works, greatly
increased in size, met the demands of the
Services for radio equipment of the highest
technical design. Its output was larger than
that of any other wireless organisation in
Australia.
The post-war A.W.A. Radiola has gained
immeasurably by the higher technical skill
of A.W.A. scientists and engineers devel-
oped during war time. It is a superb
instrument of Radio entertainment unpa-
ralleled for tone and performance one
which you will be proud to own.
Although large production is being maintained, your
nearest authorised Radiola distributor may have
difficulty in making early delivery due to the big
demand from all parts of Australia. He will, however,
gladly advise you and give details of models which
will be available.
