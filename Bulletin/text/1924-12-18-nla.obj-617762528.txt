The Nature of Woman
The controversy concerning the nature
woman, inaugurated by Mr. Way, becom
very amusing. Men have always arguec
over women—to the great enrichment
art and literature. Meantime woman laugl
It may be objected that woman lias no sen
of humor. But woman laughs as life laug
—and life hasn't much sense of humo
either. All women, says Mr. Way, are a
heart wanton, for all women love to plea
men, and to that end all women practise t
wiles of the wanton. We deduce this co
elusion from the fact that most women, u
paint and powder. Does not the conclusio
seem just a little sweeping, oli my sister
If we were as clever and logical as Mr. W:
might we not come to as ruthless a concl
sion about all men? On the gutter leva'
we find men who for mercenary motiv
traffic in the flesh of women. Ascending tl
social ladder, we find vast numbers of nu
who indirectly exploit the charm or beaut
of their waves for their own social, politico
or monetary advancement. There arc me
who marry for money or other market-plac
reasons. Running through the whole rac
may be observed a trait which makes ma
take pleasure in the power of his wome
to excite admiration in other men. Nov
there is in the language a more objectioi
able word than wanton. In the face of tl
overwhelming evidence of the facts, are v\
not. justified in affixing the stigma of tha
word to the whole race of man?
The truth is that when man, armed wit
the rule of a little one-by-two theory, a
tempts with it to measure woman, he
doomed to evoke the laughter of the who]
sex. Man makes his little codes of morality
his little conventions of truth. Woman ei
courages him to toy with these plaything
because she likes to keep him happy. Sh
may even lead him to believe that she agree
with him in thinking his little bits of colora
glass are precious jewels ; but in her heai
she feels only a yearning tenderness fo
his childishness. In her heart—or, if Mi
Way prefers it, in her subconscious—womai
is not vitally concerned with man’s littl
systems of either truth or morality. Sh
is vitally concerned only with life itseil
For woman is life. She is as false as lif
and as true; as non-moral and as moral
as worthless and as precious. The wind
function of woman is to conserve life. Dowi
through the ages, in fulfilling this function
she has conserved practically everything els
that is of accessory value to life, such a
language, art and literature. Man ha
created these things, as he creates life. Bu
man is a careless and untidy creature. He
would have hopelessly mislaid them all hat
it. not been for woman. In woman’s func
tion of conserver lies the germ of love. Pas
sion of itself can create life, but only love
can conserve it. At the back of the man
woman sees the child. Was there ever
woman, born of woman, who, loving man
did not desire to mother his child ? Thus
man is Time, but woman is Eternity.
The aversion of woman to prostitution
lies not in a natural want, of charity nor in
narrow-mindedness. The individual woman
may feel the deepest sympathy for the un-
happy woman of the pavement. If she has
a turn for introspection and a wide experi-
ence of life, she may even feel, as she passes
some such poor travesty of her sex. “There,
but for the grace of God, go I!” But, raci-
ally, woman loathes prostitution. The very
word rouses an overwhelming aversion and
antagonism in her consciousness. The rea-
son is that woman senses that, while the
prostitute is hurtful to man, she strikes a
still more deadly blow at woman. For pros-
titution is not life but death. The prosti-
tute does not conserve. She destroys. She
is, therefore, the most bitter enemy of her
sex.
Mr. Way contends that woman doesn’t
understand woman as man does. Well, well,
one can but see according to the light vouch-
safed her. So it is no use Mr. Way trying
to persuade a woman that passion lurks
eternally in the powder-puff, and wantonness
riots in rouge, and lust lures in the lip-
stick. There ireally are some naturally
chaste and virtuous women. And it was a
man whose opportunities for experience out-
classed even those claimed by Mr. Way who
said of this class of woman, “Her price is
above rubies, and all things thou canst de-
sire are not to be compared unto her. - ’
ALICE JACKSON.
Conrad as Dramatist
Conrad in the role of dramatist furnishes
an object-lesson on the essential differences
between the arts of expression in the novel
and in the drama. lie had undoubted dra-
matic capacity: all his novels, from the foun-
dation-stone of his reputation, “Almayer's
Folly” to “Chance” and “Victory,” and to
“The Rover” of last year, held tense dra-
made moments. But they were subjective
crises and not the objective situations which
the stage demands. They held in them a
spiritual suspense, defying translation into
action. Olympus could not be dragged into
the glare of the footlights. Take “Lord
.Tim” : what possible stage expression could
be given to such a drama of the conscience,
the conscience of a type, the study of an
outraged self-respect, the injured pride of an
ego touched at the ultra-sensitive point of
courage? How could it be translated by
grease-paint and costume? What intona-
tions of voice or movement of the facial
muscles could give it true expression? Mase-
field. avlio has worked in the craft of both
letters and the stage, points out the essen-
tial distinction between the two. “The
novelist,” he says, “can saunter about and
look all over the body of life,” but “the dra-
matist is forced by the nature of his art
to examine the life itself. His imagined
characters compete with life.” Simplicity
and directness of action are the life-tissues
of the stage. It has no room for the nuances
of life; for all the delicate psychology played
upon by climate, natural environment and
the environment of specialised social char-
acter; for all the elements that made up the
atmosphere in which, this man of letters
and imagination worked. Strike such subtle
and elusive qualities out of Conrad’s work
and you leave a marionette show.
It may have been that many years ago,
before the novel had become his means of
expression and the persistent and sole means,
he could have learned the sister craft of
the stage. The author of “The Man of Pro-
perty’’ and “The Country House” was the
dramatist of “The Silver Box.” “Justice”
and “Strife.” lie conquered with success
the dual art; but what was possible to him
in the days of plastic youth was impossible
to Conrad in old age.
John Galsworthy, in an introduction to two
plays by Jqse; Conrad published posthu-
mously, “Laughing Anne” and “One Day More”
(John Castle), deals with the whole dra-
matic output of the novelist; that is, the
two plays mentioned and an earlier play,
“The Secret Agent.” The three are, he
points out, adaptations from stories, and the
two now published have the same main
theme: the suffering of a woman capable of
self-sacrifice. Headers of Conrad’s novels
coming to these plays without personal bias
—and Conrad is calculated to inspire bias
—will probably agree with Galsworthy that
“the novel suited his nature better than the
play, and he instinctively kept to it.” If,
it is suggested, he had begun by writing
for the stage “without having first experi-
enced the wider freedom and tasted the more
exquisitejsavor of the novel,” he might have
become a great dramatic writer. As it was
he came to the drama quite too late and with
a pen that could not restrict itself to the
arbitrary limits and, for him. arid spaces
of the drama. Even in the choice of sub-
jects he crippled his efforts. Their source
was his own stories, and, as Galsworthy re-
marks, “the process of adaptation is gener-
ally fatal to the achievement of a stage
masterpiece; yet in ‘One Day Mora’ Con-
rad so nearly achieved a little masterpiece
as to show natural aptitude of the highest
order.” As Conrad himself said, he hoped,
despite stage restrictions, to find a means
of allowing free play to his temperament; but
his technique was not equal to the task, and
it is doubtful if, with such a temperament,
embracing, as, one of his critics has said,
"a philosophy of character often optimistic
and a philosophy of life invariably pessimis-
tic,” any technique of the stage could have
given it the freedom of expression he needed.
And if it could not. then we should have lost
in the dramatist what the novelist gave us:
food for thought, intimate sympathy, pathos
and a beauty that was as much spiritual as
material.
One of the three plays from his pen, “The
Secret Agent,” was produced by the Stage
Society, and, though Bernard Shaw pro-
fessed to have been struck by it. was not
a success, for it. lacked the qualities which
mto,rm Iris novels from the first page to the
last—and it is such qualities that have given
him a place among the great craftsmen of
fiction.
T. B. C.
Ariosto
Tlie “matter of France” became popular
in North Italy about the middle of the
fourteenth century, when an unknown Pad-
uan poet, writing a strange Franeo-Italian
jargon, produced his “Entr6a d’Espagne”
and fixed the main lines of Italian romances.
Observing in the old French “Song of
Poland ’ that Charlemagne had carried on
a seven years’ campaign in Spain, that there
had been a quarrel between the Emperor
and his nephew, and that Roland claimed
to have won half the world for his lord,
he hit upon the ingenious idea of making
Koland, like another Achilles, abandon the
campaign in a huff and disappear into the
East, to return as its conqueror. The popu-
lar romances introduce other figures from
other cycles of French chansons de gestes
and furnish Orlando with a whole kindred
ot which the original Roland knew nothing ;
the general motive remains the same—first
Orlando and then the other paladins go a-
r(jv-LnF-, and during their absence the cause
ot Christendom is in danger and the heathen
aie at the gates of Paris. All this had been
worn threadbare, and the poetry was deplor-
ahly vulgarised, when Boiardo re-vitalised
the decaying matter by the introduction of
a new theme, at once romantic and humor-
ous. Hitherto, in their wanderings, the
other paladins (especially Oliver and Rim
aldo) might have love affairs in plenty
but Orlando remained the soldier-monk who
never knew the joy of woman. And those
other affairs were only episodes. Boiardo’s
idea was to make love this time the leadin"
motive, and so infuse into the French matter
an Arthurian quality; and to make Orlando
the love-stricken hero, enamored of a Sara-
cen minx, who. being the Grand Khan’s
daughter of far ( atliay, will be appropriately
named Angelica. Boiardo’s poem, for all its
complexity of sub-plot and incident, had. as
~ riostos biographer Pigna confesses, “una
bcUissima ordifura” —a splendid design ; and,
with that, an inexhaustible fertility of inven-
tion, a marvellous skill in adapting and com-
bining themes from the new humanism and
the old romance. It has all the fresh spirit
of the early Renaissance and its author’s
own lyrical ecstasy, which makes him one
of the true singers of the morning star. He
died with the goal in sight and something
36 e 00O W hnes rdS ° f his P ° em achieved — l about
Ariosto undertook to continue Boiardo’s
Orlando. The continuation is even longer
than the original, and yet the tale is Sot
f v • • ° ? ws the huge extension
of Roiardo s plan must lack design. To delav
the impending denouement Orlando must
be sent off on his travels once more • to out-
do Boiardo his infatuation must degenerate
into madness. The secondary love-plot quite
ousts the primary interest; Angelica is
simply dismissed about half-way through
and were it not for the title at every page-
head, the reader would forget that this is
a poem of Orlando. Minor characters and
their adventures are developed with inordi-
nate length and intricacy; Boiardo’s device

and there becomes an excuse for any inlay

Z„ Lombard: Ariosto took
aside as a Tuscan. And where his
predecessor was often jerky in the movement
nfl, if verse the later poet learnt from Poli-
tian the balanced and equable alluie o
he perfected octave. The matter, then is
Roiardo’s • the form Politian s—-what bc-
Ws to ’Ariosto? The spirit. It .is a
strange thing that, outside the Furioso,
Ariosto l as left only one work that can
frill be read with interest—his six “Satires
(Horatian type). That is to say, where
he is left to himself he succeeds only _ m
the kind that is nearest to prose. TS hetliei
his mind was more prosaic than poetic in
L texture we must not discuss; certain
it is that he has no lyric gift. Nor lias lie
his predecessor’s delight in fresh natura
beauty. Freshness, indeed, of either beauty
or humor we must not seek in him- all
js sophisticated. It is characteristic that
where Boiardo will begin a canto
I heard a maiden in the month of May
Singing between the green leaf and the rose,
Upon a hillside set above a bay
Ariosto will give us cosmetics (canto 41).
The “Furioso” is certainly not as offensive
as the dull comedies where, especially in
the prologues, we grieve to see a man ol
Ariosto’s quality stoop to raise a laugh by
a creeping, leering suggestiveness. But
dissolute the “Furioso” certainly is in that
all that was nobly heroic in the old legend
is dissolved away and humor turns to irony;
the praises of the house of Este will not
make good that loss to us. ,
I have been led thus to stress Ariosto s
lack of what Arnold called “high serious-
ness,” because I find Italian opinion strongly
set upon rating him as the second Italian
poet. Now, a stranger must respect the
general opinion of a nation with regard to
its own writers; but when that opinion
shows extraordinary fluctuations, involving
the status of one of the major writers, or
the world, he recovers some rights against
it. Ariosto and his age despised Dante; lie
was at. best a sort .of Ennius in whom the
new Virgil might quarry. Then came Tasso,
and for nearly two centuries continued the
academic debate whether he or Ariosto was
the greatest Italian poet, (the outsider
Boileau took a hand in this). As late as
180f> the Pisan editor of a superb set of the
four Italian poets practically apologises tor
the inclusion of Dante as a pioneer of the
language “who made possible, in the
‘Jerusalem,’ the most stupendous work of
human genius.” Even in Byron s time
Italians read him chiefly as a prophet of
their country’s unity. In a one-volume col-
lection of the four (dated 1836) the frontis-
piece indicates this order of merit Dante,
Petrarch, Tasso, Ariosto. So has opinion
varied. Now, if there is no great poetry
without high seriousness, and no great poet
without the lyric gift, then, while not claim-
ing for Boiardo, with all his wonderful en-
dowments, a place among the majors, nor
refusing to set Ariosto above Tasso, I will
presume to think better of Italian literature
than to believe that it lias none to set in
the long interval between him and Alighieri.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Mary Colborne-Veel
Last year there passed quietly away one
of Maoriland’s most remarkable women -
Mary Colborne-Yeel. She died as she had
lived, within hearing of the never-silent ocean
which had bounded her life, but never her
mind. From both her parents she inherited
that English culture which characterised the
pioneers of the Canterbury settlement. Did
not their neighbors to the north and to the
south make many a joke about the number
of pianos brought by these “Canterbury Pil-
grims’’ to a wild and uncultivated land vthere
digging and housework soon made, the fingers
too rough for any music-making? But
Mary's parents remained true to the tradi-
tions in which they had been bred, and their
home was a centre of intellectual light and
sweetness from first to last. Born in stich
an atmosphere, Mary soon began to write,
and the lamp of her inspiration was only
extinguished by death. The frail flesh that
housed it was often shaken by illness, but
in spite of many difficulties, many limita-
tions, her life was extraordinarily rich and
full, and in itself a poem—a lyrical expres-
sion of the master-mind.
Miss Colborne-Veel’s work is to be found
in all collections of Maoriland verse, and in
1894 she published in London a volume en-
titled “The Fairest of the Angels.” It con-
tains, amongst others of varying merit, one
poem called “Jael,” which is certainly the
strongest yet produced by any woman-poet
of the Dominion. It is interesting to note
that Mr. Itayner-lloffe has made manifest
in sculpture the same conception of the
character of the Hebrew woman that Miss
Colborne-Yeel expressed through poetry.
There existed no volume of her collected
verse, and many of her most charming lyrics
were only to be found by searching through
the columns of newspapers. But now a
little anthology of her less known work,
edited by her friend and sister-singer, Jessie
Mackay, has been published in Maoriland by
Messrs. Whitcombe and Tombs, in response
to requests from her admirers in Australia
and her own country.
The editor, in reproducing these 27 poems,
has given a very good idea of the range of
her gifts, grave and gay. The wave of
nationalism in poetry, which seems for the
present to have spent its force upon this
side of the world—only, since all things are
subject to ebb and flow, to some day roll
in again upon us—left her almost un-
touched. Yet she sang with delicacy and
charm of the bush trees and the mountains
of her own country, and the sandhills that
lie between her native city and the sea —•
hills of white crowned with yellow under
the deep blue sky of Maoriland: —
A waste of yellow lupin land.
A warm wild land, a sandhill land,
A narrow strip of idle land
That only idlers know!
The best, however, of these poems, written
with a sincerity and a passion that vibrates
through all the restraint of form, is called
“Empty Homes” —those Empty Homes that
are scattered about the battlefields in Europe
and in quiet God's Acres throughout the
There comes no opening of the gate,
Though to my friend I plead and pray.
“Patience!” the shades and sunbeams say.
Through the hearts of those who lojcfl the
woman and the poet these words of ' lary
Colborne-Veel’s echo to-day with an intenser
meaning.

Danish Education and Ours
The general reader on perusing “C.O.M. s”
article, “A Lesson in Public Education
(RP. 27/11/’24), might be pardoned tor
thinking that the High Schools in Denmark
were the same as ours, providing secondary
education to youths of from 12 to IS yeais.
The Danish High Schools are rightly termed
the People’s High Schools, for in that little
country there is no such thing as secondary
education as we understand the term, I lit
children receive primary education from i
to 14 • after that they settle down to work on
farms. When they are lb they are at liberty,
during the live dreary winter months, to
attend the People’s High Schools, which are
institutions taking students from IS to ->
The students board at the school, and take
part in “inspiring lectures” in culture sub-
iects, “community singing and gymnastics.
Ninety-five per cent, of the students come
from the farms; the remainder hail from the
towns But it is a mistake to hastily assume
that the Danish education system provides no
technical education. For artisans and mecha-
nics there are continuation classes and
trade and technical schools. The agricul-
tural workers receive training on the farms.
Mr. Frank Tate, Director of Education in
Victoria, visited Denmark last year to in-
quire into its educational system, and in Ins
official report he stressed the point that the
Danish farmers are not “a body of highly-
trained technical farmers. They have a rea-
sonably good elementary schooling, a very
good practical apprenticeship, while a very
large proportion have had the stimulating
and informative experience of winter courses
in the People’s High School, followed by simi-
lar courses in the Agricultural School. ' It
is the scientist engaged at the research and
experimental stations, the "counsellors,
scientifically trained advisers to the .farmers
employed liy the co-operative societies, and
the professors of the Royal Agricultural C ol-
lege, who provide the scientific impulse to
better farming and marketing. But., despite
the grand success of these People's High
Schools in making finer men and women the
experience of other countries which have
adopted them has been far from happy. In
any case. Australian environment is so differ-
ent. We have no five winter months With
nothing doing on the farms; so, while recom-
mending vocational and cultural schools for
young farmers and others, Mr. Tate cannot
recommend the adoption of the Danish High
School system. . .
Our education is a salary-preparing busi-
ness, as “C.0.M.” complains. To a. certain
extent it lias to be. It is so even in Dew-
mark. The farmer is educated so that he
will be a better farmer, and receive more
money for his produce and labor. The sur-
plus men who cannot find a farm (there are not
enough farms to go round) study for salaried
-positions as “counsellors” and agriculture
professors. So must the youth of our land,
destined to become a great manufacturing
country, be trained for special occupations.
It is the getting of bread and butter, hide it
as you may. that rules all education systems.
Still, taking education in its widest sense,
as the Danes understand it. Australians are
not well educated; and this because the
teachers are not well educated. Right from
the time they enter the high schools to qualify
for the profession, our teachers are segre-
gated, as it were. One end is in view through
the whole period of secondary education and
teaching apprenticeship, and that is to teach
in such a fashion that scholars will pass
examinations with ease, to rise in the ser-
vice, and to secure a bigger salary every
year. So much for the man teacher: to the
woman, similarly trained, the profession is
regarded as a stop-gap until marriage is
attained. With teachers widely educated,
preferably university educated, Australian
education will improve. Victoria has made
a beginning. Last May the Education
Department and the University in conjunc-
tion held a successful vacation school in cul-
tural subjects for a fortnight. So great was
the demand for leave of absence that the
Department had to refuse hundreds of appli-
cations. Next year all schools, primary and
secondary, will observe the same holidays as
the University at the end of terms; so pri-
mary teachers will a better chance to
attend the school next May.
COUNTRY PED.
Australian Production
God save Australia from these cheap
writers from semi-illiterate countries whose
reputation, which is mostly their advertis-
ing by inferior people, is taken for granted
by many Australians! D. 11. Lawrence, a
cheap bookster, is taken seriously even by
a Bulletin reviewer; yet his nastiness is
his mainstay, an’d he ekes out a poor love*
storv of humans with the episode of the
coupling of a stallion and a mare. That is
the sort of thing that pleases the English
who banned the great Zola. This Lawrence
writes of the Australian environment: ‘lhe
old English alertness grew darker and darker.
He could feel his body, the English cool body
of his being, slowly melted, and being in-
vaded by a neAV tropical quality.” The Eng-
lish alertness! Is any prize too great for
the man who can produce the English alert-
ness” —in art. literature, music or even hard
work’ Maybe it’s the “tropical quality”
that makes the Australian do so much more
work than the Englishman.
As the movement for Australian moving-
pictures gains momentum the necessity for
a rigid Australian copyright on U.S.A. lines
becomes emphatic. There are plenty of Aus-
tralian writers of rubbish, and local rub-
bish should have the preference. We must
have writers as false as Lawrence and
Keable and Compton Mackenzie and Hugh
Walpole and W. L. George, and there are
plenty of bad short-story writers in Sydney
and Melbourne to write yarns of North-West
Australia as foolish as Galsworthy,. als9 re-
cently reviewed, ever did. But Australian
literature will be ill-treated if the Australian
writer, to be emancipated by the rigid copy-
right aforesaid, becomes a copy of Lawrence
and Hutchinson and the others.
Almost all readers and most young writers
are impressed by the belief that a mostly
publisher-manufactured reputation means
worth, whereas it means only advertisement.
In London and New York there is a public
for every nasty freak that offers. Eugene
O’Neill does not write drama, but in the
seven millions of New York there is a public
to advertise him as greater than Shakspeare
• —<rreater even than any of the freak play-
wrights from Czechoslovakia. Drinkwater
(who writes as if he didn’t) has written
neither literature nor drama in “Abraham
Lincoln.” It is a series of episodes stated
in suburban rhetoric. Galsworthy’s “Loyal-
ties” is an alleged play about matters that
don’t matter, and his “Skin Game” matters
as little as “If Winterbottom Comes.”
Australia isn't British. It's a country
with its work to do and the epic thereof:
and British writers write of weary little-
minded suburbanites—small men and women
of the most suburban country in the world.
That is why a healthy promise of future
Australian literature would bo an honest
estimation of the mostly-piffle now imported.
We need Australian books, and that need is
not to be fulfilled by banning American books
and plays and pictures in favor of the duller
British, but by making Australian production
of the three. A recent “Plain English” in
Tiie Bulletin (6/11/’24) plainly desires
to hurt American productions that the Bri-
tish may be helped. The article properly
bans the worst work of the “unpleasant
foreigners who mock at marriage and con-
jugal fidelity, paint crime, vice and mis-
cegenation in attractive colors, indulge in a
villainous jargon and even more villainous
manners, and in some cases are animated by
a vicious hostility to the British Empire.”
I have seen no instance of “vicious hos-
tility” in American pictures, but I have
seen insults to intelligence in both Ameri-
can and British films. The “vicious hos-
tility” to the British Empire seems
to affect these critics of American pro-
ductions most; but it will do Australian
writers and producers and audiences no ser-
vice if bad American pictures are replaced
by bad British pictures with a virtuous fool-
ishness instead of a “vicious hostility.” In-
cidentally. that “Plain English” writer’s idea
of a great Australian picture is “The Senti-
mental Bloke”! “The Sentimental Bloke”
isn’t Australian—it's Cockney.
The way to make production of Austra-
lian books, plays and pictures worth while
is an all-Australian Copyright Law, plus
heavy duties on imported films, and the lia-
bility to piracy of every imported book not
copyrighted in Australia by Australian pro-
duction.
RANDOLPH BEDFOFD.
“Pollio”: AA’hy is Australia so laggard in poetic
technique? One turns the pages of The Bulletin,
crawls over the Saturday issues of the S. AI. Herald,
and watches the booksellers’ counters for the latest
Alelbourne pronunciamcntos, but only the same old
tum-te-tums and kindergarten phrasings of C 3 ideas
meet one’s eye. AA’hy cannot we, who so readily
copy the United States in garb and glibness and
gabble, try to imitate their taste in graver and
more essentially spiritual matters ? This batch of
queries has been elicited by the perusal of a recent
Dial, wherein I find some account of the divagations
of Mr. Wallace Stevens. Now, there is a poet for
you! “Listening to his poetry,” says his eulogist,
Llewelyn Powys, “is like listening to the humming
cadences of an inspired daddy-longlegs akimbo in
sunset light against the colored panes of a sanct.
window above a cathedral altar. Mr. W allace
Stevens’s poetry is beyond good and evil, beyend
hope and despair, beyond thought of any kind, one
might almost say.” And this is how Mr. Stevens
“feels the impact of the Spring, and finds for his
emotions unabashed punctilious expression”:—
Tuneless mother,
How is it that your aspic nipples
For once vent honey?
Or again (this passage, we learn, suggests a curi-
ous sensuality such as one might fancifully associate
with certain of the stranger apparitions seen in the
circus ring, a bizarre niggling sensuality in accord
with some dainty physical disability) :
To what good, in the alleys of the lilacs,
O caliper, do you scratch your buttocks,
And tell the divine ingenue, your companion,
That
The full stops are in the original: probably only a
caliper’s ingenue could be trusted with that secret.
What a caliper is I don’t know, but he is evidently
callipygian. If anyone wants to know more about
Air. Wallace Stevens, he may be interested in the
“strange subterfugitive symphonies of infinitesimal
tomtoms. .. .that might disturb the painted dreams of
a praying mantis asleep in all its scaly emeiald
beauty on a linen-laid tropical table” which are the
fruit of the author’s hermetic art and finicky pre-
occupations. Meanwhile, where are Australia s ca i
per liymncrs and mantis-disturbers ?
“8.C.F.”: I hasten to the defence of my cheery
old Greek friend Epicurus of Samos against the
philistinic protagonist of ,tlie “beauty of pure
thought” (R.P. 27/11/’24). Professor Brennan ton-;
founds metaphysics with ethics when he dismisses
Epicureanism as “pabulum for the dilettante. Alateri-
alistic atomist the Athenian may have been, and
so were Huxley and Haeckel; but what a delightful
way of life it was that he surveyed for his disciples!
He conceived it to be the task of the philosopher
to show to all men the path to blessedness which
he had found, and “vain is the discourse of that
philosopher by which no human suffering is healed.”
But 1 forget. Professor Brennan regards all practical
philosophy as “an aspirin tablet for the spiritual
invalid.” We-do not all think so, nor did the
garden philosopher, with his ethical ideal of
cheerfulness, leading to care-free peace of mind.
‘Tie was the first to refuse pure knowledge,” dog-
matises Air. Brennan most lihellously and absurdly
It was, in fact, a cardinal point of Epicurus’s system
that the highest of all pleasures was intellectual
enjoyment—the activity of pure thought. AA hat dii
the Professor say that is true?
-
Fair Daughters, bv Anna Hurst (Methuen). Since,
and doubtless long before, the days of Balzac’s “Peru
Goriot,” the father of a family of daughters has
had a peck o’ trouble on his hands. In olden days
the Chinese had their own way of settling this
problem but AVestern races continue to suffer and
lay plans. That such plans, however well laid, do
not always succeed is the theme of this novel. There
are always one or two fillies who kick over the
paternal traces. In this instance the rebel is the
youngest, and, as ill luck has it for the father, his
best-loved daughter. She marries his chauffeur, but
as the chauffeur turns out to be Captain Longlcy,
V.C., all ends well. A good type of family novel.

Shelter.
He who cleaves to the city
Is as its paving stones.
The feet of no pity
Tread on his flesh and bones.
Tread on liis love and his longing
And trample the song in his ear;
And his thoughts that come thronging
Are frayed and tattered with tear.
But. afar, the trees calling
Have arms great and wide
And yellow light falling
Where a dream to a dream may glide,
Whispering gentle words
That are full of the hope of days,
Till the heart is a flight of birds
In all green ways.
He who, afar from the city,
On friendly grass
Hears the winds of pity
With soft feet pass,
Though he be as the brown soil
And the red dust,
Shall gather sweet spoil
Of the world’s trust.

Night and Morning.
Night, like a marvellous jewel,
Burns in the black. Through my heart
Visions, exultant and cruel,
Dawn and depart!
Here, where the sea-heart is singing,
Here, where the moon flower shone,
Dawn, all dim silver, comes bringing
Peace, and anon
Morning, a color god s daughter,
Laughs from the hill of the sky—
Stars in the violet water
Dwindle and die.
Dreams that are monstrous and tragic,
Ghouls from the pits of despair
Fade in the day’s happy magic—
Sea and blue air.
What though drab sorrow comes after,
Here one dear hour there is bliss;
Morning, our lady of laughter,
Stoops to our kiss!
Day, like a lark-song of splendor,
Melts in the blue! Through my heart
Visions enchanting and tender
Dawn and depart !

Under the Moon.
The moon looks down on lovers. Dreams go
by;- ,
And Love lies beautiful and somewhat sad,
While Life, in sinewy likeness of a lad,
Stoops to the waiting lips. Then two souls
fly ’ , . . .
Flutter and merge, soar to the singing skj.
Pale consciousness fades out, time's but
a fad
And Life is lost in living till the mad
Miracle swoons in syllables of sigh.
The moon looks down on lovers; but it knows
Nothing of this white joy that flames and
flows
Through the blue night. Its glance alone
discovers,
Deep in the dappled tracery of trees,
Two tangled shades; and seeing only these,
What wonder that the moon looks down on
lovers!

The Tramps.
Silent is the north wind, quiet is the
southerly,
Only echoes softly the rain upon the tiles
(Fine rain, warm rain from brooding clouds
and motherly)
And the slap of the water on the piles.
All the solemn wharf-sheds watch with eyes
unflickering
The ruddy little mast-lamps swung against
the sky
(Warm lights, cheery lights, when whips of
wind are whickering
Through the dark where the dead men
lie).
Ho, you little tramp-ships, by the black
wharves tarrying,
Rocking there so geptly upon the rising
tide!
What rare cargo were your dark hulls carry-
ing
Past the caves where the storm-kings hide?
Did you bring us dream-stuffs all the way
from Slumberland,
Tales of love and plunder from the port of
Spain,
Black coal, slack coal, coal from far Nor-
thumberland
Or a chansonette from up the Seine?
Sulphur out of Etna, apples from Tasmania—
All the little seaports north and east and
west
Yield you cargoes, from England to Irania,
From Trinidad to Tangier and Trieste.
Silently you sway there, sombre and mys-
terious,
Carrying your secrets, some day to be
told —
Tragedy, comedy, merry tales and serious
Brim over from your coal-black hold.
Oh, you little tramp-ships, when again you’re
staggering
Out beyond Pencarrow, battling through
the night,
Leave me just a little of your heart, gay and
swaggering,
And your gameness in the long, hard fight!

THE WATERSIDE LABOR PROBLEM.
In the Melbourne Trades Hall Council’s ver-
sion of the strike against shipowners employ-
ing returned soldiers from the Sydney Ship-
ping Bureau, it was alleged that the institution
in question was “the cause of all the trouble
on the waterfront of Australia during the
past seven years.” The authors of the docu-
ment contrived to forget that the Bureau
was not a cause but a consequence of the
industrial upheaval of 1917. That was the
time when the N. S. Wales railwaymen struck
because the Taylor card-system, in after
years to be adopted by Walsh’s friends m
Moscow, had been introduced in the Govern-
ment workshops; when the Sydney wharf-
laborers refused to toil bechuse the railway-
men had decided not to ; and when the wharfies
in every Australian port were, called out be-
cause Sydney controlled their union, the
Waterside Workers’ Federation, and volun-
teers had to be got to do the W.W.F.’s work
because the Allies urgently needed Australian
foodstuffs, metals, wool, hides and skins, and
wharf work had become war work. It was
a bad time for Australia and it had an un-
pleasant sequel for the Waterside Workers’
Federation. Nor was there any reference in
the Melbourne essay to the repeated water-
front strikes which have had no relation
to the Sydney Bureau —one of them
occurred because a thief had been handed
over to the authorities. Neither was any
assurance given that peace would break out
on the waterfront for any length of time if
the Bureau were abolished and its Diggers
placed on the dole, or its Australian equiva-
lent.
The report of the Queensland committee
which inquired into the causes of unemploy-
ment on the Brisbane wharves, where there
is no Bureau, is much more enlightening than
the Melbourne lucubration, although it
doesn’t refer to the strike. Boiled-down frag-
ments follow’:
Unemployment exists.
It is due chiefly to the casual nature of a calliug
which depends on such things as weather and tides,
uncertainty about imports and exports, and lack of
control over tonnage entering and leaving port.
The union has 1450 members, of whom 200 are
classed as non-effective. On an average, 480 receive
sustenance payments monthly under the Unemployed
Insurance Act, and the number has been as hign
as 600. Some of the wharfies belong to other organi-
sations, and only take on waterfront work when their
own trades are slack. In short, the union— i.e., the
Brisbane branch of the Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion—is over-manned. “A rotary or registration
system, properly safeguarded and worked, would
substantially improve the position of employees by
ensuring an equitable distribution of the work. ’
Such is the conclusion of two members of the Board,
but the employers’ representative dissents. All three
members aflirm that “the approximate number of
men required for the port should be determined ’;
that “the union should limit its membership accord-
ingly, as opportunity offers’’; and that “the calling
should be decasualised, if possible.”
Decasualisation is the solution of the problem.
“In many foreign ports a number of men —not more
than constant employment could be found for in
slack times —are employed at constant or regular
wages,” and casual labor is engaged when required.
“In Britain, America and Germany the evil effects
of casual employment on the character have been
recognised, but the nearest to entire decasualisation
has been the engagement of permanent staffs con-
sisting of less than 50 p.c. of the total labor
required.”
Oddly enough, the main recommendation of
this Queensland committee, the creation of a
Labor Government, was adopted in advance
by the very Shipping Bureau that Labor
hates so much. The Bureau employees arc
mostly permanent men who are paid on the
basis of £4 11s. for a 44-hour week, which is
9s. more than the N. S. Wales basic wage
for a 48-hour w’eck. In addition, they get
overtime pay at the award rate for casual
labor, and during the last four years and a
half their earnings have averaged £5 3s. per
week. This is a lot more than the members
of the W.W.F. average in ports where there
is no Shipping Bureau, although a Federation
wharfie can earn the Federal basic wage in
29 hours’ labor—when he can get it to do.
Again, the shipowners who patronise the
Bureau say that their permanent staff has
given better results than they ever got from
an equal number of casual laborers under
the system favored by the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court, with its rate of 2s. 10id-
per hour. Perhaps the Bureau is applying
the right idea in the wrong way. It might be
best for all concerned if the Bureau em-
ployees joined the union, provided the rights
bestowed on returned soldiers by Common-
wealth and State enactments and the advan-
tages of the Bureau system were secured to
them. But in any truce that may be patched
up these men must not be sacrificed. They
fought for Australia, and they have given
proofs of their willingness to work for Aus-
tralia, whereas at a crisis in the nation’s
history the non-soldier majority of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation turned Aus-
tralia down.
* * * #
The Prime Minister announced at the
week-end that he was going to try his hand
at settling the strike. His intentions are
good, but if be imagines that the mere abo-
lition of the Shipping Bureau, or any such
concession to the Walshes and Gardens
of militant unionism, will solve the water-
side labor problem he is only deceiving him-
self. Shipping Bureau or no Shipping
Bureau, there are too many men hanging
round the wharves in all the large ports.
Some are bad characters who have taken to
wharf-laboring as much for what they can
steal as for what they can make at 2s. IOJd.
per hour; and others are tempted to thieve
by opportunity and the insufficiency of their
earnings. Hence the enormous amount of
pilfering that goes on, to the discredit of the
union and the injury of its fellow-toilers, for
the value of the stolen goods is, of course,
added to the cost of living. The majority
of the waterside workers are no doubt honest,
but the inconstancy of their employment
under the casual-labor system, the infrequent
feasts of high wages and the long spells of
idleness when their 2s. 10id. per hour is no
good to them, tend to make them thriftless,
irresponsible and discontented. Doubtless
the general adoption of the Queensland com-
mittee’s recommendations, particularly the
employment of permanent staffs wherever
possible, would lessen the danger of strikes
by improving their condition. And a world
of trouble would be avoided if the Arbitration
Court were equipped with the power of local-
ising disputes by the infliction of heavy penal-
ties. Obviously the Melbourne watersiders
didn’t want to be involved in the wrangle
over the Sydney Bureau, and the same applies
to the Fremantle men, who threatened to
make a hole in the harbor with the carcase
of Walsh (imp.). An amendment of the
industrial law to prevent branches of feder-
ated unions being dragged into disputes
which don’t concern them, or bled white for
the maintenance of strikes about which they
were never consulted, is long overdue.
A LITTLE PROGRESS IN THE
NORTH.
On a recent day, in pleasant summer
weather, the last span of the railway bridge
across the Johnstone River was put in place,
and Queensland's coastal Soutli-to-North
railway was connected as far up as Cairns,
which is in latitude 16 and a fraction, and
so very far up that he who goes due west
from it and doesn’t mind his feet is liable
to drown in a branch of the Arafura Sea. It
was a great event, and the kind that doesn’t
happen nehrly often enough in Australia.
The railway isn’t all it might be for quality,
being of the 3ift. brand; but it belongs to a
State which possesses the merit that, more
than any other on the mainland, it avoids
the Curse of the One Bloated City. It
wouldn't be regarded as a meritorious State
on this account in Europe or Asia or Africa
or America, or in the Arctic, or even in a
place as near and familiar as Maonland, but
on this continent it is a shining example.
Queensland has developed its outports (uot
mere coal ports like Newcastle, which can t
be avoided, but outlets for miscellaneous
trade) to such an extent that among the 17
resorts for shipping along the coasts of the
mainland which are important enough to be
mentioned in the Federal volume seven belong
to the Banana province. The inclusion of
an accidental spot such as Thursday Island
means nothing, but the other places owe
their importance to the fact that each has
been deliberately joined by rail to its natural
hinterland, whereas in N. S. Wales a rail-
way will go 250 miles out of its road to drag
a hinterland away from its natural outlet.
But for the ill-luck which selected almost
all the bad harbors and overlooked almost all
the good ones, even better results would have
accrued. Still, even with that drawback,
Queensland has to its credit almost all that
has been done in the way of settling Tropical
Australia. Last census showed 190,862 in-
habitants (barring aboriginals) in that
region, and 181,397 of them were along the
Queensland lines; which tends to show that
with a connected system of railways, as dis-
tinguished from isolated and semi-abandoned
scraps like Port Hedlaiul-Marble Bar and
Darwin-Katherine, and with even a paltry
measure of decentralisation, the North is a
hopeful land. A really strenuous decentrali-
sation policy, which would put the Far North
1000 miles closer to its seat of government,
would work wonders. Meanwhile, the won-
dcrs which huve been done should make the
Federal South-to-North undertaking a live
question.
* * * *
The Queensland Ministry naturally seized
the occasion to speak a piece concerning the
good qualities of the North. There was no
lack of material. The latest Federal figures
dealing with the proportion of births to popu-
lation cover five complete years and two half-
years—seven tables in all. Always Queens-
land’s birth-rate was well above the Com-
monwealth average. Among six States it
scored one first place, five seconds and a
third. In every case except one its death-
rate was below the average, and though it
hardly did so well in this line as in the
matter of births it was twice recorded as the
healthiest among the half-dozen. Four times
out of seven it was recorded as having the
lowest death-rate among babies under one
year of age, the great flu’ year being the
only one when its record was worse than the
average. For a State which possesses 30
per cent, of Australia’s tropical area and 95
per cent, of its tropical population these are
no mean results. Yet the advantages of the
healthy North being little understood in
Britain, there is, as one Minister lamented,
great difficulty in getting new arrivals to
settle right off in the regions above Capri-
corn. A superstitious fear has to be com-
bated and a prejudice to be lived down. It
is being lived down, but the process would be
infinitely faster but for the selfishness of
verbal patriots who prevent the establish-
ment of new States and State capitals in the
tropic land where they would tend to show
that the North is just Ordinary Australia
and not an outlying nigger lt
would be more rapid, too, if the National
Capital had been set on the other side of
latitude 23, to prove that the North is a
White Politician’s country as well as a White
Man’s country, instead of the political hub
being planted in the cold, bleak south-east,
amid a scattering of rich men’s estates.
The belief in the unfitness of the tropics
—not unhealthy patches such as can be
found in any zone, but all tropics—for per-
manent white settlers, and especially for
working settlers, was imported into England
from India, and then carried from England
here. The carrier, as a rule, never lived
in India or any other place adjacent to the
equator; he has merely picked up and
adorned the tale of Anglo-Indians of the offi-
cial, military or rich mercantile sort, who
get back to their old haunts in England to
spend the remnant of their days in livery
repose. The typical Anglo-Indian of long
standing has a tendency to be supercilious;
to discourse to those he considers his in-
feriors in the tone he used to his habitual
nigger; and to put on sufficient “dog” to
eat up all the sheep on a squattage. He
certainly did no manual toil in the tropics,
and, as a rule, he wouldn’t have done it in
any country unless convicted of something.
He is redolent of a place where the white
carpenter and bricklayer and ploughman
don’t work, and are never likely to, partly
because the cheap colored man is there in
abundance, and mostly because the white
man -who attempted to ply a trade would be
treated as one who dragged down the pres-
tige of the race. Anglo-Indian children are
sent “home” to be educated because a local
education would involve some association
with colored folk, some loss of that aloof-
ness which helps so materially to keep the
ruling caste on top, and more dragging down
of the prestige of the race. A legend has
grown up that the climate, which is to a
great extent only the aboriginal smell, neces-
sitates many things; but most of them are
only habits. The Anglo-Indian and many
another Anglo-Black or Anglo-Brown, who
was never a worker in the accepted sense
of the word, but only a hotel-dweller in warm
parts, goes “home” in his later years with
fixed views of his own. The white tropical
settler doesn’t, as a rule, go “home” to dis-
pute the point, because he has made a home,
and is at home already. The Australian is
really a much better authority on the ques-
tion of the white man’s prospects as a
dweller between Cancer and Capricorn than
all the Anglo-Indians since John Company’s
early days. Australia has more tropical
territory than India. In tropical Queens-
land alone it has a larger pure white popu-
lation than there is in all India, including
Snowy India up among the Himalayas. It
is a working population in the plainest sense
of the term, which the Anglo-Indians never
were, and it is entering on its fourth or fifth
generation of continuous residence, which
the Anglo-Indian never did. Australia re-
quires no lessons from anybody on the sub-
ject of its White North. It is in a position
to open an academy and give lessons, lne
pity is that some of its own rulers are so
hard to educate.
ADVERTISING.
The art of advertising was probably the
underlying motive of half the beautiful and
enduring work left by the ancient world.
When the huge statue of Pallas Athene
soared high, over the topmost roof in
Athens, its amethyst eyes flashing under the
brazen helmet, it was meant to cry aloud to
the ships on the sea and all the little neigh-
boring parish States that the most persistent
and intelligent of the goddesses had her
throne there and would protect the place
against ill-wishers. When the Queen of
Sheba visited Solomon lie was at pains to
show her the art-work of palace and temple
in order that she might carry home a sense
of the real value of trade with Judea. lhe
Great Pyramid itself was probably an adver-
tisement to the sun and all the minor deities
that the king who was great enough to com-
mand the labor necessary for such an under-
taking was far too important to be ignored
on all the dark journey of death. In the
more directly commercial Hellenistic age,
wonders such as the mighty figure that be-
strode the harbor at Rhodes and the sky-
scraper Pharos at Alexandria were intended
to carry the fame of the builders to the
marts of the world and so sway trade in tlieir
direction. Even the great cathedrals of the
Middle Ages were competitive advertisements
shouting to God and all the saints the piety
of the districts in which they were erected.
They were also, like every temple facade
and every church steeple in the world, adver-
tisements to the true believer to come and
patronise the best brand of religion. It was
only a peculiar type of enthusiast who could
find in the unclean hermit’s cell an odor
more pleasing to deity than the incense under
the stately roof and massive tower; the vast
bulk of the people saw a stronger refuge
from their fears in the larger and more
ornate building. Advertising and religion
were always mates, and the first commer-
cialism grew out of the pilgrim traffic to holy
places. Art was the means employed by all
three to impress both the public and the
unseen but very profitable gods. At cer-
tain periods this art rose to great heights;
at others it spread itself out in constant repe-
titions that faded into commonplace. Some-
times it clearly understood its meaning and
purpose; sometimes it only weakly imitated
the past without guessing either what it stood
for or why it existed at all.
* * * *
Fairly viewed, the business of advertising
is one of the most honest in which humanity
ever engaged; and at its best no skill is too
high and no genius too great to press into
its service. The true advertiser’s message
is the same through all varying forms: “I
have something better than you possess to
share with you.” The fact that the sharing
is done at a handsome profit makes not the
slightest difference. The wares of Tyre
were naturally worth more in Corinth than
in their native markets. It has always been
the glory of trade that it yields a double
profit, and that the gain of the buyer
may be equal to or even far greater than that
of the seller. The men who sold
Christianity to their Greek converts for a
few meals and the contents of a primitive
collection-plate were not making an essenti-
ally kinder deal than those who sold Arabian
horses for a few articles of clothing from
Babylonian looms. One set of sellers might
work in a higher sphere than the other, but
mutual profit was the general idea. And in
order to do this good deed of barter there had
to be advertising. Not all men had the gifts of
that prince of advertisers, St. Paul ; but all
sought some striking and original mode of
bringing the thing they wished to trade before
the notice of the public. The kings and
emperors gave splendid shows because they
wished to permanently sell the services of
their families to the nations and reap the
profits that only such services could give; the
cities beautified their streets that they might
attract people thither; the very flags of the
nations at sea were trade-marks to be re-
membered in connection with the goods the
ships carried. In spite of all the quaint
talk about art for its own sake and the
effort of genius being its own reward, the
fact remains that practically all effort which
was not directly devoted to the bread-and-
butter tasks of the world has been in the
nature of advertising. The rich man sur-
rounds himself with the signs of extrava-
gance in a manner far beyond his needs; the
man of higher culture surrounds himself with
the tokens of his attitude to the world. Life
is far too short for the collector to handle the
items in his collection very often, but he
finds great joy in his possession of them.
They are his standing personal advertise-
ment ; and towards the perfection of that
advertisement art is continually working.
The objection constantly taken to self-adver-
tising is based on a misuse of terms. Every
man advertises himself, even if he does so by a
sufficiently remarkable self-effacement; it is
bad and clumsy assertion of self that is to
be deplored. The greater advertising has ele-
ments of humility in it, but its gracious side
is seen in that each honest man is trying to
put something that is best in himself before
other men for their advantage and his profit.
He may do this by painting a picture or writ-
ing a poem or devising a mouse-trap ; but
every sincere and enthusiastic effort is iu
the nature of advertising.
* * * *
Recognising advertising in its various
forms as a social thing which is part of the
life of every human group, the thing neces-
sary is to see that it is done well. This
is the more difficult to do because there is
infinitely more of it than ever before. It
flickers on the picture screen, it glares in
electric signs against the sky, it bleats from
the receiver of the wireless set, it fills tlm
streets, the newspapers and the shop win-
dows. It is found represented by ugly letters
far back in the green of the bush; it startles
the gazer as the steamer rounds the bend:
it slips in between the friendly letters in the
ordinary mail. But all this merely shows
that there is a great deal of it, not that
it is done well. As a plain fact, very much
of it is done abominably. Yet much atten-
tion has recently been given to the matter,
and there are those who claim that the
business has been raised to the dignity of


a science. For the most part that claim
is itself only part of a coarse shout The
so-called scientific workers have, as a rule,
gone to the United States for inspiration;
and in advertising, as in everything else,
importation is one of our troubles, for wliat
niav win one people will merely irritate
another. Enormous sums of money have
thus been invested in sheer disfiguration;
and the names of many of the people who
have been guilty of this social crime are
displayed in huge letters where all may read
them. * Any vandal, however lacking in taste
or brains, may display anything short ot
sheer obscenity if he is able to pay the cost.
The right to a clean view is as much the heri-
tage of every citizen as the right to breathe
clean air; yet by securing the high wall of
a building for his purposes, ‘the person of
the worst taste may destroy a mile of pros-
pect with some abomination which can never
bring him a single penny of return. The
matter is one for citizen committees and
general agitation. The public will get just
what it will stand, and no more.
THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT.
The N. S. Wales Government Statistician
says that in the year ending June 30. 1924,
the million city of Australia and its en-
virons drank £11,349,000 worth of alcoholic
beverages, which works out at £5 2s. Bd. of
beverage per throat of population. This
was lid., or 24 long beers (approx.), per
palate more than last year. In 1914-15 the
amount per capita was only £3 17s. 9d.
Being a godlike creature, man drinks
water to assuage his thirst and beer for
the sake of companionship; if he did other-
wise he would behave as the beasts, and his
meals would be reduced to the mere gratifi-
cation of animal wants; which, of course,
makes Prohibition merely the animalisation
of man. One should imagine, therefore,
that, since beer signifies joy and the Syd-
ney citizen swallows such a deal of it,
the million city would be one vast temple of
gaiety and a perpetual thanksgiving unto
life. Instead of which it strikes visitors
as rather a gloomy city ; indeed, if it were
not for its laughing harbor and the irre-
pressible exuberance of its other natural
features, it would be classed amongst the
saddest of the world’s great wens.
Its sombrest hour is just that period of
the day when old-world cities feel most
friendly and expansive. That is the hour
after dinner, when the open-air cafes of
Paris and other Continental cities are full
of music and laughter, and when people who
do not want to sit drift along the boule-
vardes for the sheer joy of drinking the atmo-
sphere of grateful relaxation.
The other night I had occasion before the
theatre to dine in town, and went into a
George-street cafd. A waitress was upending
the chairs and dumping them noisily on
their respective tables. She stared basilisk-
like at me. I ate a hasty meal and, rather
than risk damage to my digestion from that
intimidating stare, got up and went outside
as quickly as I could.
The street was full of hurrying people, but
nevertheless looked empty and forlorn. It
was half-past six, and I made off towards the
Gardens; but, remembering a notice stating
that the gate would be closed at 5.45, I re-
traced my steps. I lingered in front of a
milliner’s window full of waxen women clad
in bathers ; there was real sand on the floor,
which, after the hard pavement, looked in-
viting, but it was inaccessible. I watched
an ex-Digger put two shaking terriers
through their repertoire of tricks, until a
policeman moved them on. Then the bright
window of a missionary society attracted
me. It'had an arrangement like a cathe-
dral door, which opened and shut auto-
matically, disclosing a Bible whose pages
slowly turned and presented each time
a different text. I think the subject
was the story of Job. I read for a while,
but the interval between each pair of revela-
tions was so prolonged that I lost the thread
of the narrative. A newsboy selling what
was left of the afternoon editions told me
the story of his life, but it wasn’t sordid
enough to be interesting ; so I wandered into a
dirty little bookshop, where I absorbed enough
propaganda from back files of Soviet Russia, a
weekly devoted to the dissemination of the
truth about Bolshevism—published in Mos-
cow by the Soviet Government—to turn a
less radically-minded person than myself into
a Red Terror. There was no room in the
shop for a chair, and I was footsore; and
as it is easier to keep walking than stand
still when one is footsore, I left Moscow —
which, by the way, I found in 1914 a gayer
city than Sydney—to the judgment of the
next reader and went out into the million
city again.
The citizens who had rushed home to their
dinners were now pouring back again to
stand in queues outside the various places of
amusement. I walked round the White Way
counting the lamps, and en route saw a
motor-bike with a young man attached rush
across the road in George-street and up the
pavement after a passing girl who was try-
ing to escape from it. After rounding her up
against a shop window it fell on her, and a
crowd gathered while the young man dusted
her down and apologised. This was the
most entertaining thing the million city had
as yet provided me with; but it was appa-
rently an unpremeditated event and not a
regular fixture. After going once more round
the White Way and counting the illumina-
tions again to confirm my previous figure, I
found it was time to get into my seat; but
my appetite for amusement had had the edge
taken off it, and I did not enjoy the play.
It may be argued that Sydney’s gloomy
evenings are due to early closing. But one
does not remember any difference in this
respect between pre-war Sydney and the
million city of to-day; and, as a matter of
fact, if the habit of the continental cafe
had been intrenched in Sydney, its early
closing would never have come about. What
has made Sydney, despite its sunny climate,
a mere antipodean edition of the grey cities
of Britain is our ingrained custom of taking
our drinks behind the flap doors of dingy
pubs; so that for joy-making purposes this
mort of liquor which we pour annually down
our throats is largely thrown away.
NAKIIODA.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Empire of the Air.
Reflections oh some aerial sports: —
Richmond was having its festival of youth. The
big hangar, set in the wide plain which stretches
from the long scarp of the ranges by Kurrajong
towards Sydney and the sea, was full of eager young
men. They rushed to and fro with boxes of tools,
swung themselves on the propellers of the big
machines, crooned lovingly over the baby ones, went
off to work-benches to consult together over the
shape or temper of a part, or retired solitary into a
corner to perform their secret devotions with a
blow-lamp. Mechanics in blue dungarees worked, not
as men work who build things with their feet on the
ground, or who make mundane things for base and
ignoble purposes, but as those men must have worked
who built the Golden Hind or Magellan's flagship.
They worked in a cold frenzy of reasoned inspiration.
Shouts went to and fro —the voices of happy and
impatient men. The pilots ran out to look at the
wind-gauge and back to look at. the work, and
climbed into their seats and out again as if they
felt themselves parts of the mechanism of the huge,
man-made birds, and ought, like the albatross, io
live in the air. The sound of mighty rushing wings
outside brought everyone to the great doorway of the
hangar to see how So-and-so was doing with his
silvery monoplane, built in an outhouse in a suburb.
Youths with downy lips drew one aside to tell about
the new type of fusilage they had designed, or the
revolutionary engine they had conceived, but couldn’t
get executed in Australia because of the expense;
and they stared at one with feverish eyes and drew
in the grease of a table complicated pictures to make
their urgent message plain. These are the explorer*
and navigators of a new world, just as much as Da
Gama and Balboa were. We may be in the twentieth
century of doubt and disillusionment, but these
young men are back in the great age of Shakspeaub
and Elizabeth.
They are the great world-shrinkers. Draw a map
of the globe on a scale to represent the fastest
passage made by a sailing-ship between London and
Sydney, and then redraw it to the scale of the
Imperial Airship Service, the machines for which
are now in course of construction. The result is
startling. The smaller map is to the larger one
as a postage-stamp to a sheet of notepaper. The
smaller map brings Europe, Asia, Africa and Aus-
tralia into a compass no larger than the State of
N. S. Wales. It will be possible soon to reach
Europe by air quicker than it takes to go to Port
Darwin by water. It takes longer now to cross this
continent by rail than it will take to reach the
mainland of Asia by airship. Not that the excited
young Titans of Richmond have considered this
aspect, of their activities; but it is an aspect which
the rest of Australia must take into consideration.
There were perhaps a dozen machines in the hangar,
of all shapes and sizes and colors, like a tray of
assorted butterflies in a museum showcase. The
three or four big imported machines reared up like
truculent bumble-bees with queer lumps like bunches
of pollen on their front legs, and stared down their
noses at the lookers-on. The little locally-built
machines lay on the ground like disabled flying-ants,
and people stepped over them, and their owners
wheeled them about as if they were children’s play-
things. When all is said and done it was not a
very wonderful roomful for this Commonwealth of
six million peopla to produce in six years of peace
and reconstruction. Its quality was magnificent, but
its quantity was smali. There were more ’planes to
be seen in the air at Le Bourget, outside Paris, and
Cricklewood, outside London, in 1920, than there
were in all the week at Richmond.
The baby “fliers” which performed such wonder-
ful feats of endurance can be constructed for less than
£5OO. They should be counted in Australia' by the
thousand instead of by the half-dozen. This vast, iso-
lated continent, with its scattered population, needs
for its defence and for its development the conquest
of the air. If the nation is ever to be released
from the constant fear of foreign invasion—a fear
that is as bad almost as the tyranny it dreads —it
must make itself so powerful in the air that no
enemy would dare to invade it by medium of the
sea. Still, here are the pioneers. They are a
small band, but an enthusiastic one. It will be an
amazing thing if the flying week at Richmond does
not prove an inspiration.

The Coal industi-y.
Ever.' industry and every individual is directly
or indirectly dependent on coal; its price is of
as much importance in everyday life as the
price of food: in fact, food prices are much
affected by fuel prices. For a number of
years the latter have risen steadily, and have
been followed automatically by transport
charges and prices for manufactured goods.
Then has come the stage at which foreign
competitors have been able to undersell
locally-made goods in spite of heavy protec-
tion, and our factories have been forced into
idleness. Those who have watched the work-
ings of the industry cannot, escape the con-
clusion that the real cause of the continued
high price of the mineral lies in the attitude
of the miners and owners not so much to-
ward each other as towards the industry
itself. They have realised that they are the
controlling factors 'in production, and are
consciously or unconsciously determined to
take advantage of the position. From time
to time the miners have demanded and been
granted increased wages, and the owners, in-
stead of making every effort to cut costs else-
where, have been content to hand on the in-
crease to the consumer. When wages de-
mands have become quite disproportionate
to services rendered, there has been no fight;
the nation has paid the piper. Limitation
of output by the men in order, as they think,
to increase employment, and the continual
stopwork meetings and strikes over petty
grievances, have added their quota. The
owners have apparently not cared as long as
their profit was still in sight; why should
they worry? Industrial history in Britain
and America, in Belgium, France and Ger-
many, has shown time and again that, when
fuel prices are right, industry, both primary
and secondary, is right; and in all these
countries investigations have been made to
find the means of keeping prices at a satis-
factory level. The Coal Commission in the
United States issued a report some months
ago dealing with the principal causes of high
prices in that country. Over-development
was considered an important factor—mean-
ing the added cost to consumers of maintain-
ing large numbers of miners above the real
needs of the industry, and the burden of
excessive capital charges. Bu't equally im-
portant was the conclusion that neither miners
nor owners realise that their own best
interests are served by a combined effort to
serve the public to the best of their ability.
Given that co-operation in far-sightedness
here, industry would revive, and increase to
such an extent that our coalfields would
prove to be under-developed rather than over-
developed, and all the miners now working
part-time might reasonably expect to be in
full-time employment. In the final para-
graph of its report the U.S. Commission
says:—
The Commission believes that the public interest
in coal raises fundamental questions of the relation
of this industry to the nation, and of the degree
to which private right must yield to public welfare.
It may be that both private property' in an exhaust-
ible resource and labor in a public-service industry
must submit to certain modifications of their private
rights, receiving in return certain guarantees and
privileges not accorded to purely' private business or
persons in private employ.
Here in Australia we have given the parties
to this industry “certain guarantees and pri-
vileges not accorded to” ordinary businesses:
the ex-Prime Minister did it very conspicu-
ously during the war, and the practice has
been followed ever since. But when we look
for anything granted to the public in return,
we look in vain. It is a -one-sided business,
and it is time both National and State Gov-
ernments came to the rescue of the other
party—which is merely the public.
—.——
Ketch and Co.
J. H. M. Abbott attends a hanging:—
One day last, week I went to see a man hanged at
Long Bay. It was not my first hanging, nor my
second; but I hope that what I have to say may
assist in making it the last that any Australian
may have to witness.
It was a beautiful morning, and Botany Bay and
the lllawarra mountains looked their loveliest. We
produced our authority from the Sheriff’s Depart-
ment to attend the party in “B” Hall, and waited
in the guardroom for the approach of 9 o’clock.
There were six of us, three of whom had never before
had this experience, and three to whom it was no
novelty. The youngsters looked pretty white, and
the rest of us felt it —though we pretended not to.
At 8.4 f) the Under-Sheriff and the Superintendent—
both genial, kindly men, loathing the job in hand
as much as everyone but the hangman and his mate did
-—came across and interviewed us, the former warn-
ing the neophytes that under no circumstances would
they be permitted to leave the place of execution
until the surgeon had certified the principal per-
former to be a corpse. Then we walked across the
wide yards of the prison to “B” Hall. There was
no sign of so much as one of the 400 prisoners who
generally give the place the appearance of a hive,
and over everything silence hung like a fog. On the
walls were the armed sentries; and uniformed warders
stood at their posts, and saluted the Superintendent
as we passed. The only cheerful things to be seen
were the sparrows playing about the flower beds, and
a happy-looking willy-wagtail, who did not seem to
be aware of what was going on. If he had, one
supposes that he would have flown over the walls,
horrified at the things that human beings do to one
another.
“B” Hall is a long, gloomy arcade of cells—two
storeys of them—-and is exactly similar to “A,”
save in one respect. At the end opposite the entrance,
and immediately below an immense arched and
barred window, the encircling gallery widens out,
and a strong wooden beam stretches across from
wall to wall. Beneath the beam is a broad trap-
door, whose halves meet in the middle, the joining
being parallel with the beam. This is that archaic
relic of mediaeval brutality, the gallows—the working
plant of the old established firm of Ketch and Co.
It has no pretensions to beauty, being simply and
grimly utilitarian. On either side of it are two
“condemned cells,” for the last hospitality to the
party, or parties, about to be hanged. So far, in
the history of Long Bay, only one party has had to
be provided for at a time, and the cell on the right,
as you face the gallows, has, on the four occasions
of the latter’s use, been the one tenanted. The
patient is brought there the night before, or early
on the morning of his fatal day, from the Observation
Ward, where three warders have taken it in turn
to see that he doesn't do Mr. Ketch out of his well-
earned emoluments. The distance from the door of
the cell to the drop is, mercifully, little more than
six feet.
Directed in whispers, we sat down on two benches
placed half-way up the hall, one behind the other.
The three “old hands” took the front seat. The
Chief Warder guarded us. Then some hours seemed
to elapse—though it was only minutes—while we
contemplated the rope slanting from the beam, to-
wards the left, sharply silhouetted against the brilli-
antly sunlit window. From the bottom of the plat-
form a canvas screen depended. On the last occasion
when the writer witnessed one of these Long Bay
shows, there was no screen. Grateful tribute is made
to the present Under-Sheriff for his forethought for
the feelings of the Press. The silence and hush was
presently broken by the Under-Sheriff, the Super-
intendent, the Deputy-Governor, and one or two
others tiptoeing along the gallery to the cell door.
The four or five warders standing on the gallows
pulled themselves together, as the managing directors
of Ketch and Co. went in to tell their customer that
it was time to pay up. Already inside were the
Chaplain, the Surgeon and the watching warders. A
murmur of voices reached us, but the silence was
still deadly and oppressive. We could almost hear
our hearts beating.
Then Mr. Ketch, carrying some straps in his
haj.d, and accompanied by his understudy, came
swiftly and quietly across the platform, and went
into the death chamber. More silence, a further
br.xing up of warders.
Came the unhappy Chaplain, the Superintendent, the
Under-Sheriff, Mr. Ketch, warders, and a ghastly-
looking man in prison clothing—a grey jumper and
white pants—with his arms lashed about his body.
His pallid face was dreadful to look at. He walked,
or shuffled, in dazed fashion, to the centre of the
drop, guided by the painstaking Ketch, and stood
there with his eyes shut, a most pitiful picture of
abject misery.
The swift John Ketch lost no time. He adjusted
the shackles about the dying man’s ankles, covered
his face with a white cap, picked up the noosed
rope, placed it about his neck, tightened it under
his right ear, held the slack clear of him with his
left hand as he stepped back from the drop, and
signalled his assistant at the lever that releases tha
boits of the trap-doors.
There was a sort of rattle—and then a crash that
sounded like a house falling down, and interrupted
the sobbing Chaplain as he bravely tried to read the
beautiful burial service of the Church of England.
“Man that is born of ivoman hath but a short time
to live. He” —and that crash and thud concluded
the service, as the heavy doors banged against the
padded buffers that keep them from swinging. \
bad lad came to the end of his tether. “God help
us alii” one thought—“and him too, for the matter
of thatl” For a little while the rope quivered and
shook—and then became still. The murderer was
dead.
Since we had to sign a declaration that we had
seen him well and truly' killed, after the Surgeon
had satisfied himself as to his defunctness, we went
behind the screen to assure ourselves that such was
the case. The sight of that limp corpse dangling
at the end of a string filled the writer, for one,
with disgust and loathing for this beastly method
of killing a man—as it had done on the previous
occasions when he' had seen it practised. Kill
such a blighter as this, by all means —but not in a
fashion that was old before Christ was crucified.
A whiff of gas in the cell that he left 20 minutes
ago would have been a mercy, not onl3 r to him, but
also to Ketch and Co.—and the Co. includes, besides
Sheriff, p. ison officials, and newspaper men, a com-
munity that pretends to some enlightenment.

Aii Australian Nile.
11. F. Bernett, a Digger with first-hand
knowledge of Egypt, Palestine, Syria, India
(lie served with the British garrison under
Bawjinson and Birdwood) and North
Westralia. has been giving his impressions
of the last-mentioned country to astonished
Perth and Adelaide reporters. He started
by telling them that “the rivers of North
Australia make the majority of southern
streams appear mere creeks by comparison.”
Then he went into particulars about a little-
known region where lit' put in 18 months: —•
The Fitzi'oy River, which rises in the King Leopold
range and empties into King’s Sound, is over 50')
miles long. For more than half that distance it
traverses a flat plain of rich alluvial soil, which
has an average rainfall equal to that of Adelaide.
For five or six miles on either bank the soil is
extremely fertile, as the station gardens, tended only
by natives, or by natives under the supervision of a
Chinese gardener, prove; and tobacco and cotton,
where experimented with, have done splendidly. Jn
most years the Fitzroy sends down a volume of
water which compares with that of the Nile; in
fact, the surrounding country is inundated for a
greater width than used to be flooded by the Nile
before the British engineers came. Even now the
cultivated area in Egypt is barely 5,000,000 acres,
and, although there are 600 miies of Nile water
below the Assouan dam, only about a mile on
either bank is tilled for 400 miles. The Fitzroy
valley reminds me of the valley of the Indus, and
is superior in some respects, though smaller. The
climate is more bearable, the rainfall greater and
more regular, and transport is not so difficult. In
my judgment, the Fitzroy basin is splendidly adapted
for closer settlement, and the same is true of a
dozen other river valleys in North Westralia, which
is Australia’s danger zone. But there is no culti-
vation at present, apart from the station gardens;
there are not a hundred white people on the Fitzrov.
Practically all flic Fitzroy River country is
Crown land held under pastoral lease —by
cattlemen, for the most part. It wouldn’t
cost much to buy out the squatters—-in the
present state of their industry the cattlemen
would jump at the chance of selling—and
prepare the land for tropical settlement on
scientific principles. Australia can do with
a lot more home-grown cotton and tobacco
—its imports of raw tobacco alone have been
averaging £2,500,000 p.a., and most of the
stuff comes from its very bad customer, the
U.S.A. And, as the population grows, it
will want a lot more cane-sugar, especially
if the plans for converting the bagasse into
celotex and the molasses into power-alcohol
materialise. Then the power-alcohol people,
besides proposing to buy the five or six
million gallons of molasses annually wasted
at the Queensland sugar-mills, will, they say,
require vast quantities of cassava, sorghum
and sweet potatoes if they can come to terms
with the Commonwealth Government. All
these products could be grown in the Fitz-
roy basin, and Australia would feel a lot
more secure if a virile white community were
growing them. There are opportunities here
for wealthy Australians who talk a great deal
about “the necessity for populating our
empty North,” but never back their opinions
with their money. A company of such men,
by acquiring portion of the river flats and
putting settlers on to grow cotton, tobacco
and other vegetables for which there is a
sure market, all under scientific direction,
could do great things for Australia on the
Fitzroy. There is small prospect of the
Perth politicians tackling such a venture
(they would only make a mess of it if they
did), since all their settlement plans are
for the South, where the votes abide. Their
latest thrilling achievement has been to pro-
vide British immigrants with doubtfully fer-
tile south-west farms which arc averaging
£1750 instead of the £IOOO agreed upon—
the taxpayer has to find the extra £750. And
the newcomers are to grow dairy produce,
the market for which is in such a state that
the average dairy-farmer in Queensland, at
any rate, hasn’t earned a pub rouseabout’s
wage for years.

Co-operation and Immigration.
When a British Cabinet Minister attributes
the small population of Australia to “lack
of true co-operation with the homeland,”
what does he mean? Australia through all
the earlier years was governed from England.
Free institutions were set up without auv
friction or slackening of sympathy, and that
was almost immediately followed by the gold
discoveries, which quickly doubled the popu-
lation. Since then there lias been a perpetual
co-operation in raising money on the London
market for various forms of development,
a great deal of voluntary assistance rendered
in two wars, and latterly a constant trotting
backward and forward of important
Australian statesmen. We have worn
much British clothing which we might have
made at home, we have cooked our food
in British pots, eaten from British plates,
built our houses largely with British tools,
fed British people with our corn and beef,
read British books and magazines, paid
interest to the British moneylender, and
welcomed British princes with much en-
thusiasm. It is true that Empire con-
ferences and things of the sort are of recent
growth; and if these mark the beginning of
the true co-operation, how long shall we
have to wait for results? It could
not fairly be argued that it was co-operation
between the United States and Britain
which caused ten people from the British
Islands to migrate to America for one who
came to Australia, and it is difficult to
see how the greatest possible drawing to-
gether of British and Australian statesmen
could induce people to settle here. The
means which may be employed to place the
claims of Australia before people who have
made up their minds to leave English soil
have very little of the co-operative element
about them. Britain would gladly get rid of
several millions; but most of those millions
are hopeless as settlers. On the other hand
the very people Britain can least afford to
lose and least wants to lose are those whom
we most desire to have. We could very well

Jellicoe and Jutland.
I)eab Bulletin, —Viscount Jeelicoe re-
tired automatically from the Navy on the
age-limit the other day, and performed the
act in N. S. Wales (which is an honor to
this country) on his way home from Maori-
land. It was promptly pointed out to him
that he was now in a position to write the
whole story of Jutland —the one absolutely
complete story, by the man who knew the
inside of the commander as well as the out-
side and inside of the shindy—-and thus so
llatten hostile critics that they could pass
under a door without disturbing the mat.
lie replied that it was the Navy’s way to
retire in silence, and throw no brick or
Parthian arrow over the shoulder while leav-
ing. It is to be hoped that British Ministers
and ex-Ministers (especially tin* latter) will
unanimously release the Old Man from any
obligation of this sort, and urgently request
him to write all he knows, and add his candid
opinion of all hands. No one, so far as
I understand, regards Jutland as one of the
deadly blunders of the campaign. In fact, it
looks like one of the very few clean-cut epi-
sodes of a war in which Britain topped its
record for “muddling through.” When it
muddled worse it failed to get through. Prize
blunders included :—-
(1) The sending of marines to Antwerp when the
Belgian Government applied for long-range guns,
and when there was no more immediate demand for
foot soldiers than for foot warmers. That was the
end of Antwerp for four years.
(2) The silly expedition to Gallipoli after the
Turks had been warned by an abortive sea attack
that the Peninsula was aimed at.
(3) The clumsy betrayal of Serbia. That State
sent impassioned assurances to its big Allies that
Bulgaria had more than half-decided to come in on
the llun side, and demanded permission, in the inter-
val after its first great victor}' over the Austrians, lo
serve Ferdinand of the Hebrew Face with short
notice that he must be friend or enemy. Britain
in particular bade Serbia not to be rash and to
rely on its deep, deep diplomacy to manage and
win over Ferdy, with the result that the Austrians,
their German reinforcements and Feudy fell on the
little State at their own time.
(4) The desertion of Serbia, where the Gallipoli
troops might have done real service. The bright
fe. lure of the awful ultimate disaster was the way
in which Italian ships carried off 80,000 Serbian
soldiers and refugees who might otherwise have
been pushed into too sea. The humorous feature was
that Seroia, in its worst straits, hung on to some
24,000 Austrian prisoners, and shoved them on to
the Deliverer’s ships as trophies.
(5) The gross blunder of Ivut-cl-Amara, and the
surrender of an army there.
(6) The beguiling, by Britain and the other
Allies, of Roumania into the war when it had be-
come practically isolated and its entry merely gave
the Hun an opportunity to use it as a source of
supply.
In addition there was the abandonment of
Montenegro, and the delay of three years
and eight months in thinking over a unified
command. Really the mueh-grumbled-at
battle off Jutland appears almost the only
faultless operation on the British side. At
the time there was much expenditure of
guff and tosh over the question of what
Nelson would have done if he had been in
the North Sea. What I’ompey would have
done in Paris is also a problem to which I
have given some consideration. Jeeeicoe
did and received much damage, but he got
his enemy to a desperate craving for home,
and he got between him and home. He
didn’t fight a second battle during the night,
but I don’t think Neeson made a habit of
attacking by night either. Yet in that his-
toric hero’s day and generation there were
neither mines, torpedoes nor submarines to
confuse the issue, and in addition he could
take certain chances which don’t exist now,
for Britain was able to feed itself whether
Nelson’s fleet was lost or not. A man who
commands the Last Hope of the State has
to consider many things. In the morn-
ing Fritz was gone to a safe refuge, having
dodged through or round his enemy while it
was dark. Neeson could tell much better
which way his enemy, being a wind-driven
circumstance, was liable to go in the dark.
And even Nelson, who was always up
against second- or third-rate men, and had
fewer newspapers to contend with, used to
lose his enemy now and then, else Napoleon
would never have made his leisurely pro-
gress to Egypt or his hurried progress back.
It will be a loss to history if Jeeeicoe doesn’t
write a book. It would have been no loss if
French hadn’t written one.—Yours, Clif-
ford Snook.

Colonel Amery, Colonial Secretary in the
Baldwin Ministry, might profitably begin
his term of office by ridding himself of the
fatuous notion, which he aired at a Canadian
emigration function in London the other day,
that it is more difficult to acclimatise Britons
in the Dominions than Eastern Europeans.
The people who hug this delusion seem to
think that folk from “Eastern Europe '
(which may mean anywhere from Lapland
to the I'ineus, with Russia and the Balkan
States included) are adapted by their early
environment to withstand the alleged terrors
of the Australian tropics, the African veldt
and the Canadian prairies. Most of Eastern
Europe is afflicted with a long and cold and
rigid winter. That may help the inhabitants
to put up with conditions in Canada or on
the high veldt, but it has negligible qualities
as a preparation for. say, ISorth Queensland.
As a matter of fact, the imported Britisher
can outstay the imported Eastern or South-
ern European in any climate. He has done
it all over the world, and his descendants
have improved on liis capacity. The pioneers
who opened up and settled Queensland from
the Darling Downs to Somerset were British
to a man —mostly English and Scottish at
the beginning—and acquaintance with that
fearful land and the enervated weeds who
inhabit it does not lead a sensible person to
the conclusion that the Italians or the Greeks
or Serbs or Bulgars, or even Maltese, could
have done any better.
“NOW, T SHOULD SCARCELY HAVE KNOWN MYSELF!"
“Saaedi” : The fact that ■‘prominent pas-
toralists” so frequently express emphatic ap-
proval of a continuance of Freetrade in
merinos seems to surprise some observers.
To the initiated it isn’t at all surprising,
for they know that these “prominent pas-
toralists” are usually stud breeders who profit
greatly from the present policy. Obviously
the measure of their profit is the measure
of the industry’s danger. The example of
England in this connection is illuminating.
For many years a series of lucky occurrences
and conditions combined to make that nation
a monopolist in the manufacturing line, and
hence Freetrade at first harmed her not at
all. To-day she has industrial rivals every-
where, but still clings pathetically to the
Freetrade fetich. The result is that unem-
ployment and economic difficulties now beset
.T. Bull at every turn. Undoubtedly the
Freetrade policy was mainly the outcome of
an arrogant belief in J.B.’s oaaui omnipotence
as an industrial nation, resulting from a lack
of competition in the initial stages. Like-
wise in the matter of our merino monopoly
the consequences of competition are hidden
because there is no competition to speak of
in evidence. However, it won’t be our fault
if this lack of competition continues: we are
doing our best to raise up rivals. The an-
cients, who were sound thinkers in their
own way, held that, when a man became very
wealthy, it was wise to sacrifice some of his
possessions to the gods lest he lose the lot.
The time has arrived when the small sum
that comes from the sale of stud sheep
abroad must be sacrificed if we are to retain
the magnificent monopoly which has been so
far the mainstay of our economic life.

“Country I’ed” : The classified teachers em-
ployed by the Vic. Education Department
number i 987 men and 2902 women. This
gives a proportion of roughly two to three,
which may be a fairly satisfactory ratio,
though it would be better if the sexes were
equally divided. But among all the first-
class junior teachers employed there are only
5,-J young men who will be classified next
year, while 421 young women will go out
Into country schools. This disproportion is
alarming. In many of the largest schools in the
U.S.A. the principal is the only male member
of the staff, and in some instances the super-
intendent of a number of schools is .the only
man having any connection with a school.
The proportion there is one man _to nine
women ; and many educationists belic\ 7 e that
the modern emotional, sentimental, highly-
strung American, with his love for over-
emphasised dress, maudlin pictures and sug-
gestive plays, is the direct result of the over-
Avhelming predominance of the feminine
teaching influence during the most plastic
years of his life. Certainly there is a danger
that way; and Australian State Govern-
ments (Victoria is not the only sinner)
should, therefore, devise means of attracting
men to the teaching service. One way not
to do it is to run a sAveating department.
The result of inquiries following the receipt
of numerous angry letters from Europe:—
Letters from Europe—France in particular—have
made complaint about the delay in the payment of
moneys due to Continental artists for pictures Avhich
were exhibited in Australia as the “European Art
Exhibition” in August of last year, with Penleioii
Boyd in charge; and these letters have been supple-
mented by a cable in which it is said that further
complaint has been made by artists in England.
Blame for the delay has been fastened on to the Com-
monwealth Government; and it seems that some blame
really does attach to those persons who loosely gave
certain vague authorities, or what might have been
regarded as authorities, to act on behali of the
Commonwealth, without taking steps to see that the
obligations entered ' into were promptly honored.
I’enleigh Boyd went to Europe under the terms of
a contract between himself and Hugh D. Mclntosh
to make a collection of pictures for exhibition and
sale in Australia; and he was provided with letters
from the Commonwealth Government commending his
mission. Further than that, the Commonwealth had
no part in the show; but it is only natural that
European exhibitors who have not yet received
the payments due to them should look to the authority
whose guarantee they virtually accepted. That the
payments have not been made is not the fault of
the late Penleigh Boyd or his executors. The artist
was at his death a joint trustee of the money re-
ceived for the sale of pictures, which money was
kept in a trust account; and in March of this year
the amount at credit, £2413 15s. 6d., was handed
over to the gentleman who was regarded as the prin-
cipal in the business, who was about to leave for
England, and who represented to the Penleioh
Boyd executors his urgent desire to settle with the
artists. The delay in payment is, therefore, not due lo
the Boyd trustees, and is probably a matter which
will be shortly adjusted.

Tiie little republic of Estlionia nearly lost
the number of its mess the other (lay, when
Bolshevism came down on it by night in a
dozen places at once. Estlionia has about
l j million people and fewer acres than Tas-
mania. It has a ono-llouse Parliament, uni-
versal suffrage (“direct, equal and secret”),
the referendum, the initiative, no death pen-
alty and a banner of black, white and blue.
About GJ per cent, of the inhabitants are
described as “Russians and other nationali-
ties,” and it was on these and an armed horde
of conspirators from the Soviet country that
devolved the job of butchering the Govern-
ment, seizing on power, and announcing that
the citizens and citizenesses desired, of their
own free will, to join up with the Beast of
Revolution, who lies between them and the
sunrise. It was the case of Georgia again,
only this time the luck of the Communists was
out. though the butchery was horrible wdiile
it lasted. If Estlionia did want to join up it
would doubtless have signified the fact by
initiative, referendum or plain Parliamen-
tary vote. The humorless Sovieteers, how-
ever, are used to none but bloodsheddy
methods. So they profess that a self-govern-
ing nation, when it wants to alter its form
of government, naturally does it by cutting
its own throat and burning its own house
in the night. Even in Australia plenty of
Red Rag folk are quite prepared to accept
the Soviet’s assurance that free people
always throw off their own yoke that way.
What saved the harmless little republic, for
the hour, at least, was the fact that it has
a standing army of over 20,000 men always
available, with 40.000 more on leave but to
bo found at a day's notice. “Militarism” is
the price of liberty very often.

Randolph Bedford on Australian copyright:
“Machete,” with all the absolutism of the name-
less, says that I “protest too much” in my cham-
pionship of the American copyright law because
I said that the American writer of fiction “docs not
undersell the Australian novelist with bad work, as
the English writer does.” I repeat that not any of
the bad stuff that comes out of America is as bad
as most of the stuff that comes from England.
There is no English fiction magazine good enough to
approach the Saturday Evening Post at the worst,
and the U.S.A. does not sell to Australian news-
papers tripe serials at a tenner a time; that is
the work of the Britisher. And I never said: “Give
American magazines preference.” I said: “Protect
the Australian against all of them, with preference
least of all to British serial fiction, which is infinitely
lower than the American —poor as some of that
can be.” I repeat that the anti-Americanism of'some
Bulletin paragraphists is not pro-Australian but
pro-British, and to be pro-imperialist is to be anti-
Australian. There is nothing hysterical in that well-
considered statement, which is as true as any general-
isation can be. Further, I intend nothing political
by that statement of the necessity of an effective
Australian copyright law, and as a writer I presume
I may be allowed to know something of that by
even the blunt-edgcd “Machete.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The waterside strike is reported to have
been “settled” on terms involving the aboli-
tion of the Sydney Shipping Bureau and the
admission of its returned-soldier employees to
the Waterside Workers’ Federation. But
the “settlement” ignores the fundamental
fact that there is a surplus of labor on the
waterfront; also, it coincided with another
brisk outbreak of job-control in the Seamen’s
Union. In fact, when the parties to the
“settlement” shook hands Walsh and his
Reds had quarrels on with (1) the Fre-
mantle lumpers, (2) the Westralian Labor
Government, and (3) the inter-State shipping
companies; and the indications were that
the Friends of Russia would be distressed
if the customary general hold-up didn’t hap-
pen at Christmas.
Australia’s wandering Matthew Charlton
was deposited at Fremantle last week by
the Commonwealth liner Largs Bay, and was
graciously permitted by Walsh (imp.) to
slip up to Perth while the Seamen’s Union
and the Waterside Workers’ Federation de-
bated whether the Largs Bay was “black.”
Any steamer not owned by Russians or
Asiatics is liable to be declared “black” these
days : for that matter, the Westralian Labor
Government has been indicted of “black
treachery” for sending police to the Fre-
mantle wharf, where, among other pleasan-
tries, Walsh’s pets have been preventing pas-
sengers from landing in this allegedly free
country.
Manufacturing industry is still being
patiently killed off in that vast section of
N.S.W. described as “Remainder of State,”
otherwise the part which isn’t Sydney. The
details have now crawled as far as June,
1.923, and these are the last three years’
figures:—
N.S.W. Factory Employees.
Remainder
Sydney. of State. Total.
1920- 104,552 40,459 145,011
1921- 110,589 38,287 148,876
1922- 114,864 37,402 152,266
The decaying “Remainder of State” includes
Newcastle district, with the B. 11. Prop. Co.’s
steelworks, the Austral Nail Co., Lysaght’s
wire factory, certain brick and cement and
bottle works, and Walsh Island; also it
takes in Litligow, with the Commonwealth
arms factory. So the rest of the great
“Remainder” has evidently got back to much
the condition it occupied when Captain Cook
was about, so far as providing for its own
wants is concerned.
Allan, who runs a Cabinet in Melbourne,
was a fashed Scot and muckle astonished
when a recent deputation told him that there
are between five and ten thousand unem-
ployed unionists in Melbourne, including one
man who is wholly blacklisted by his mates
because, no matter how he tries, he. can’t be
slow enough. Considering the slump in the
woollen trade, more than half of which is
located in Victoria, through the influx of
shoddy and “British preference” goods, and
considering the strike, the statement might
be true. Allan said wildly that it is time
to apply the quota system “to countries out-
side the Empire.” On racial grounds that
is true as regards many countries, but not
all. On industrial grounds it is bosh of the
boshest brand. The quota system should be
applied to goods, not to people who make
goods.
The disarmament balloon w r as very
thoroughly pricked by Sir George Thurston,
Vickers’s chief expert on implements of
war, in a contribution to “Brassey’s Annual. ’
lie points out that a 10,000-ton ship built
within the limitations imposed at the Wash-
ington babble can be designed to fire a
broadside of unpleasantness weighing 22461 b.,
against the wartime standard of 6001 b.
IT.S.A. is laying down eight of these evasions
of the spirit of Peace, Japan and France
six each, and Italy two. The fundamental
fallacy of disarmament is that if national
armaments w r ere. reduced by international
jaw to frying-pans, the experts would invent
a super frying-pan with spikes on it, and
the nations would go to war with that. A
number of small and needy nations, whicn
can't afford expensive weapons, would then
be able to join in the argument.
The Bruce-Page plans for controlling
exports of dried fruits and dairy produce
w r ere approved of by the necessary majori-
ties, the voting being 15 to 1 for
the dried-fruits scheme and 3 to 1
for the other. Only 50 p.c. of the
fruit-growers marked ballot-papers, and not
20 p.c. of the dairy-farmers troubled to ex-
press an opinion one way or the other (the
highest percentage was in Queensland, where
the majority was adverse), but the Govern-
ment regards each verdict as a victory.
Whether the public will have equal cause for
satisfaction remains to be seen.
THE GREAT RENUNCIATION.
“Tasmania has commenced the collection of the revenue formerly collected by the Commonwealth
from Tattcrsall's. As the latter is still officially an unlawful business, the Tas. Government is uneasy
lest the Commonwealth Government may now enforce the law. The Prime Minister, however, assured Mr.
Lyons, Premier of Tas., that, in view of the circumstances, no action to upset the arrangement is likely
to be taken.”
P.C. BRUCE (to the painted lady) : “No more of your tainted money for me, my girl
I’ve presented my rights to my impecunious friend at the rear; he's not squeam-
ish. The — ah.—policc protection will, however, continue as — ah — usual."
At Perth Mat Charlton, homeward bound,
announced that be had returned from the
League of Nations’ annual session with a
firm faith in disarmament and the Geneva
protocol. As to that: —
It has been said that a question involving the
White Australia policy should not be left to an
international court to decide, but the highest authori-
ties assured me of the safety of leaving such a
question to the court. Yet people in Australia
advocate that the question should rather be left to
the League Council.
Who are these people? The real Australian
view is that the White Australia policy is
no more a matter for reference to any
foreign court or council than the Japanese
army policy or the TJ.S. fiscal policy. This
Commonwealth is not to be palavered into
receding from that position, and it will be
unhealthy for Charlton if he makes the
attempt.
Theodore says that “North Queensland is
the most prosperous part of Australia to-
day.” The evidence is irrefutable. “More
than 160 first-class free passes to Brisbane
are being issued to employees of the Cairns
railway.” The common taxpayer goes
second-class, and pays for himself —or else
walks.
A fact mentioned quite frequently in The
Bulletin but strangely disregarded by most
Tasmanian dailies during the constitutional
controversy is that a Governor’s official
“Instructions” require him, in all local mat-
ters, to act upon the advice of his respon-
sible Ministers. If, therefore, Premier
Lyons “advised” his Ex. to assent, to the
Appropriation Bill —a document, in this in-
stance, which the Assembly had resolved
should be presented for the Royal Assent
without reference to the Council’s proposed
amendments thereto —there was nothing for
the Governor to do but give that assent.
The Speck Administrator may or may not
have had cable correspondence with the
Colonial Office during the recent crisis. But
the fact remains that he already had full
authority to act.
A newspaper statement that the Common-
wealth line of steamers has been losing
£1,000,000 a year is described by 11. G. B.
Larkin, chairman of the Shipping Board, as
“absolutely incorrect and very damaging.”
That may be so, but the indignant gentle-
man’s neglect to give the figures for 1923-24
and his vague remarks about, “high running
costs,” “slackness of trade,” and “losses
more pronounced than those of other oversea
owners, but compensated for by the advan-
tages” (an allusion, perhaps, to Wallsh,
imp., and his job-controllers), are not re-
assuring. When introducing the Common-
wealth Shipping Line Bill, the Prime Minis-
ter stated that the losses for 1921-22 were
£1,171,569, and for 1922-23, the figures
being not quite complete. £1,020,150. The
chairman had better argue the matter out
with the Prime Minister.
Egypt wants Nationalism of some sort.
Apparently assassinationalism.
From the N. S. Wales Gallery:—
Most of the “work” done lately has been of the
electioneering variety. The Fuller Government can't
afford to alienate the Progressives, so it fished the
Local Government Amendment Bill out of the ash-
barrel into which the Leg. Council had shot it and
invited the nominees to change their mind. Then,
to please the Sydney Telegraph, it dug up the
report of the pony-racing committee and had it
debated after a fashion ; and, to gratify the Sydney
Guardian, whose boss is the head and front of the
pony-racing business, it put up “Sandy” Jaques,
himself a member of the committee, to say that
“the report should be adopted for what it is worth,”
t’.e.j nothing'. .Next, to placate the Progressives some
more, the Government went ahead with the new Rail-
ways Bill, which provides, among other things, for
two assistant commissioners and four area commis-
sioners as well as the present chief, James Fraser,
whose salary is to be raised from £3OOO p.a. to
£5OOO. The measure was roughly handled by mem*
hers on both sides of the House until Goldstein, the
loquacious chap from Randwick, moved that a life
pass should be granted to every Assemblyman who
had sat through three Parliaments. Then the unmi-
mity was touching and beautiful; “the motion was
passed on the voices without discussion.” After that
the hon. gents, rested from their labors, satisfied that
they had planted the standard of civilisation some
furlongs further into chaos, as somebody expresses it.
Two metropolitan members of Vic. Uppah
Chambah have been laying a mine to wreck
the Income-tax Bill framed by the Allan-
Peacock Cabinet. Seven years ago the Honse
threw ont Peacock's super-income tax. but
that was embodied in a separate bill, whereas
the whole of the present income-tax pro-
posals, designed to raise £2,000,000, will be
in one measure. So it is unlikely that the
mine will be exploded even though e,xi
Treasurer McPherson did some fist-shaking
in the Assembly over the big rates.
Queensland's philanthropic Government
has appointed an official listener-in to man-
age a State, radio-station. ()f course, the
Government Broadcasting Bureau won't
carry out any propaganda. At least, it is
so stated. And why shouldn't Queensland
have a State Jazz Band?
“Constitutional'’ is a big word, but it is
not too large for the mouth of Tom Walsh,
general president of the Federal Seamen's
Union —he has been lecturing Westralia's
Minister of Labor McCollum for behaving in
an “unconstitutional” manner. The big word
is hard to define, but presumably Walsh will
accept the Moscow meaning of it. The Bol-
sheviks executed 17 stevedores in Pctrograd
the other day for going on strike, striking
against the dictatorship of the proletariat
being unconstitutional. Was Walsh really
blaming MeCallum for not having hanged
anybody?
A deputation with a gimlet on its banner
came at a Commonwealth Minister the other
day with the cheeky demand that, as the
Federal prohibition of Tattersall’s had not
proved effective, all letters going to Tasmania
should be opened in order that any contain-
ing applications for tickets might be inter-
cepted. Asked who was going to undertake
the job of letter-burglar, tin; deputation
boldly said that it could find volunteers for
the task. On which the only comment
needed is that decent men have an objection
to opening other people’s letters without
their owners’ sanction.
More quaint reports drift in from the N.
Territory, where the A.W.U. has done its
best to suppress land industry, and the Navi-
gation Act has chased away ships, and the
population has gone, bar officials and relief
workers, and the principal things which won’t
go are Minister Pearce and the mixed ship
Huddersfield. The last report was that the
settlers west and east of Darwin were starv-
ing again, and that the Government food-
and-generally-useful boat, John Alee (MO
tons), had been heard of a fortnight back
as aground in a river. For want of wire-
less or something, information then stopped.
It may have been eaten by crocodiles by now
for all anybody knows. It all illustrates
what a keen watch we can keep on our
northern coast.
The Australian unionist finances the
A.L.P., and even subsidises the foreign-born
Communists who drag him into their
maniacal irritation strikes, but he shies at
supporting Labor newspapers. During the
last year or two he has refused to pay levies
for the Sydney daily that was to have come
out before the war, and has let his Adelaide
Herald and Hobart World perish. Now
the N. S. Wales coal-miners, by a majority
of nearly 3 to 1, have sentenced to death
their readable little Common Cause. The
truth is that the average worker is not really
keen on Labor-Socialism or Communism,
but, owing to a series of weak concessions
on the part of Australian Governments, those
ragged causes have become so mixed up with
trades-unionism that to repudiate one or the
other is to risk being branded as a “scab.”
And scabbery has come to mean joblessness,
ostracism, newspaper attacks, physical in-
jury, or the constant fear thereof, and per-
secution of women and children.
Opening sentence of Melbourne Age:
leader (9/12/’24) :
The man who is always ready to advance excuses;
why ships and many other things cannot be built ini
this country is an Australian of a poor type.
To which it may be added that the paper
which is always ready to advance excuses!
why a transcontinental railway can’t be
built in this country is a publication of poor
type, to say nothing of the fact that the ink
is dim and trying to the eyes. Also the
patriotism that consists wholly in the pi*
motion of shipbuilding and other big-coas*
city industries is hardly any type at all, al "

Everything is done by halves ;
Maki-g things is not our line.
Every job of taste and skill

We must show our loyalty.
We're the market for the goods

Britain has her hardy broods
Hived in both the hemispheres.
She has kept the indoor job ;
We must face the wind and sun,
Always pay tbe extra bob

Yet the game is in our hands
If we played it with a will;
We might sell to all the lands
Products of our thought, and skill.

Sheffield steel would shine as clear;
By a little faith and trust
We could settle Bradford here.
We could make the spindles sing
As they never sang before
If we dared one simple thing—
Putting bolts upon the door.
Then Australia’s thronging ways
Would be full of eager zest;
Our own markets in such days
For our goods would prove the best.

With the exchange difficulty at one period
so great as to be almost menacing, it was
pretty generally anticipated that the Wales
would show a smaller profit; and even
general-manager Oscar Lines may have been
surprised when he found himself in a posi-
tioil to exhibit an almost negligible decrease
compared with the corresponding period
of '2M. The bank moved to and from London
for the twelvemonths no less than f>r> mil-
lions ; and had it not been for the high cost
of transferring funds back from London the
profit would have been substantially better
instead of slightly less. The management is
not quite sure whether everything is smooth
sailing even now. The scheme finally
accepted by the Associated Banks and the
Commonwealth Bank promises to work out
satisfactorily, but the position of the trading
banks at the end of the export season still
remains to be seen. One way out, as the
president of this bank sees it, is for private
banks to be given back the right to issue
their own notes, adequately safeguarded, of
course, and on a fair interest basis; but
there is not much chance of that if the pre-
sent. arrangement works out with even a rea-
sonable amount of satisfaction. The banks
are certainly not to blame for the exchange
difficulty. High prices for wool- and other
products certainly made the financing of
exports difficult, but the root of the evil is
the prodigal borrowing policy of the Govern-
ments, and against that there is hardly a
bank chairman in Australia who hasn’t re-
peatedly warned them.
When the Great War started there
was a fairly general idea that bank
figures would show a great shrinkage.
How, it. was argued, could it be otherwise
with tens of millions of men withdrawn from
productive employment and put on the job
of destroying wealth at a rate never before
approached? The next two sets of figures
show how wrong the prophets were. They
forgot the printing-press. They forgot that
banking figures don’t necessarily represent
real wealth at all. Hence the astonishing
growth of the figures between 1914 and
1920:

After 1020 the printing presses were given
a rest, and, as the process of paying the piper
began, the very large increase in the country’s
real wealtli is not reflected in the totals.
Last year there was actually a small shrink-
age in deposits. Probably there was a con-
siderable accumulation of savings; but
as against that there; was the disappear-
ance of £021,700 of advances under the
War Gratuity scheme, and when that went
the balancing item went also. On the other
side are these three great bundles of assets:

Liquid assets are Lss than they have been
at. the September balance for many years
past. Several movements have contributed
to that. The holding of Government securi-
ties has been reduced; and that is a good
thing, for, though banks simply have to stand
by Governments that have loans falling due,
it is no part of their business to keep funds
tied up in these securities. But a still larger
drain upon this bank has been caused by
the demand for advances: there has been
an increase of no less than £5.355,000 in two
years. In ordinary circumstances this very
rapid movement would make one a little
uneasy; but here again the exchange diffi-
culty has been a disturbing factor. All the
same, the increase has been too rapid to last,
and the figures amply justify banks in seek-
ing for a reduction whenever circumstances
permit of it.
Notwithstanding larger advances, this great
old bank is still able to show that 45 p.c.
of its total liabilities to the public are in
liquid assets. These compare with the hold-
ing of the war year in this way:—

Approximately 9s. 7d. of each £1 of lia-
bilities was within easy reach, and there
was, in addition, £BBO,OOO in premises and
£43,208.810 of advances, both written down,
the former very hard.
Shareholders’ funds (apart from internal
resources) amount to £10,300,000-odd, and a
return of less than 0 p.c. on them would
suffice to pay the 10 p.c. div. Divulged
profits are much greater than is necessary to
pay tin* 10 p.c. and make provision for con-
tingencies. Exes, are heavier, but nothing
that can be thought of is likely to affect the
return to shareholders. No mention was
made at the general meeting of any increase
in capital, although an issue at par had been
anticipated. At present there is just a shade
under £6 of the public’s money in the busi-
ness for every £l. of capital and visible
reserves; when the last lot of new capital
began to come in there was £0 15s. to every
£l. From this point of view there is no
immediate call for new capital.

Australian cos. arc beating down the pre-
judice among local insurers by sheer merit.
Consider how the Queensland, created by the
late James Burns 40 years ago as an offshoot
of the Burns-Philp shipping business, an-
swers to the tests which policy-holders may
apply to insurance cos.; (1) Proportion of
funds to risk: Capital and reserves total
£885.032. Premium income last year was
£509,200. Funds equal to 150 p.c. of pre-
mium income are generally accepted as ad-
equate. There is that and a little more in
the £885.032. (2) Form and availability of
funds: Here, in tabular form, is how the
co. has placed its mite: —
, 1914 1924 x
p.o. n.c.
Government securities £64,498 14.8 £637,269 52.9

sundry debtors . . 214,708 49.4 409,697 34.0
Premises .. .. 110,830 25.7 112,827 9.4
Not a penny is in mortgages; the Govern-
ment securities are named, and so are the
resting-places of the fixed deposits. The co.
thus passes that test flying. (3) History and
reputation: The introductory tabic supplies
the answer to that. The co. distributed only
01 p.c. of its profits and placed the remainder
to reserves, which are now equal to 77 p.c.
of capital; and although there have been
heavy issues of bonus scrip the interests of
policy-holders have not been thereby jeopar-
dised —the money has boon kept in the busi-
ness for the protection of risks. Finally, an
office eager to extend its business, as this
one plainly is, is not at all likely to give
itself a bad name by niggling over its settle-
ments.
• • • • • •
The year’s profits show a slight improve-
ment, which means that the Queensland
fared better than most other cos. in the same
period. This may, however, be a ease of
good fortune waiting on good management.
Fifteen years ago capital was £75,000. There
is now a round half-million, and the differ-
ence represents gift issues, the first made in
1931. The co. was guided originally by
James Burns, a man with a remarkable gift
of imagination, and his successors have main-
tained the traditions he established; with
branches and agencies scattered over the
globe, almost half its business is now won
outside the Commonwealth. After a period
of dulness its business in “the East” is ex-
panding. During the year a branch was
opened in New York, and within the last
few weeks another has been set up in Mon-
treal. Aggregate figures have moved as
follows:

An increase in the expense rate would not
have been surprising in view of the com-
petition and the additional business written.
To clip 4.1 p.c. off it was an achievement.
The loss rate was, as with most cos., greater
than of late; in fact, one has to go back a
long way to find a term when the propor-
tion was so high, for 1914. which was a bad
year for many cos., did not hit the Queens-
land very hard. Prospects for the near
future are brighter, and should find reflec-
tion in insurance. Post-war problems are
giving way before the efforts of the Great
Powers. England seems assured of stable
government for at least five years, America
is opening its purse-strings now that the
solid Republican party is in charge of White
House, and here in Australia a golden season
has provided justification for optimism. So
far as shareholders are concerned the 124
P.p. div. (which, by the way, represents
16s. Sd. p.a. on each £l of capital actually
subscribed) seems assured. Interest and
rents alone last year provided all but £7534
of the amount; and, as for assets, in addi-
tion to those specified, the figure at which
premises are in the books (£112827) is pro-
bably _ very much under what they would
bring if placed on the market to-morrow.

The record profit i.s no puzzle in the light of
those figures. For a long time the co. had
the S. Australian field to itself. It was
incorporated before any other trustee co. in
Australia, except one in Vic. A few years
ago two more, which had the patronage of
powerful interests, started. But their advent
seems merely to have let people know the
advantages of a trustee who doesn’t die or
leave for Guam; and the old E., T. and A.
■ gathers increasing quantities of moss as it
rolls on. But the dividend is not so good
as it looks. The co. has repeatedly issued
capital at a premium: from 1910 to 1920
£34,050 brought in premiums of £11,759, and
so the div. and the yield to the investor are
two different things. Shareholders have also
left so much profit in the business—reserves
at September 30 were £79,102 and capital

Risks are very slight. Practically there are
only two. One is the misreading of a will
and in consequence the misapplying of funds;
and if a trustee lias a doubt as to the inter-
pretation of a will he can seek directions
from the Court. The other is that the co.
may slip in investing its own funds. This
co. doesn’t take many chances; it has its own
little bit invested this way : —-

The reserves are very heavy, but the co.
shows no disposition to depart from its un-
broken policy and capitalise some of them.
The time, nevertheless, is coming when the
directors will inevitably feel impelled to do
something. The new building just com-
pleted, and now largely rent-producing, is not
likely to make their difficulties in that agree-
able respect any less.

The deadness of the copper market —the
price averaged £O7 17s. fid. last year whereas
the average for the preceding year .was
£73 12s.—influenced 'Lyoll’s profits, and,
although the earnings are lumped and so can-
not be analysed, the total undoubtedly owed
its size to the co.’s other interests. These
side-lines, which have a book value of
£700,000, or more than half of the paid
capital, are themselves now important and
growing industries. Substantial additions
are being made to both the Yarraville and
Fremantle chemical (fertiliser) works, and
by-products are being steadily added to:
at Yarraville, for instance, regular pro-
duction of caustic solution and chlorine is
reported, and the Board, looking ahead,
wants a tariff or a bounty on caustic soda.
So far as copper is concerned, the co. bent
its efforts to improve treatment, and so cut
costs. But it got no help from outside. The
Commonwealth Arbitration Court again
awarded a rise in wages, and this, vlus rises
in coal, coke and freight, neutralised the tech-
nical improvements. The quarterly adjust-
ment of the basic wage increased the bill by
£12,000 p.a.. equal to nearly £2 per ton of
copper produced; and since the close of
accounts another increase has been granted.
The average earnings of contract miners were
265. 2d. per shift. I nhappily high wages
are no insurance against industrial trouble.
A timber workers’ strike of eight weeks inter-
fered with production at the Nortlr mine;
and the Kembla coking plant was idle for
five months owing to the cokeworkers’ strike.
Meantime in the rest of the world the 44-
hour week is unknown and wages are tend-
: ing downward, so that Australian producers
are handicapped almost out of the race.
Lyell does not now detail its mining and
smelting costs, but in 1921, when general-
manager Sticlit said that costs were down to
bedrock, £BO 13s. was spent on mining, con-
centration, smelting and realisation per ton
of blister. 1 )espite wonders in reducing
costs, the co. must now be very close to the
limit. Here are output figures:—

called on only for the supply of pyrites for

The output of blister copper was better than
for a number of years, but this was due
chiefly to the smelting of concentrates which
had accumulated in the previous year when
the installation of new plapt held up sinter-
ing. At September 30 concentrates on hand
amounted to 240 tons as compared with 5587
tons at the close of the previous period. Im-
provements not only reduced costs; they so
improved recoveries that these are now better
than were formerly obtained from direct
smelting. The sintering and smelting plants
deal with the concentrates much more rapidly
than they are produced, and thus work only
intermittently. Returns, therefore, are in
future to be published quarterly. Overall
recovery show r ed an increase to 90.74 p.c.
from 86.52 p.c. for 1923. So, too, in the
smelting, the copper recovery reaching 96.53
p.c. One blast furnace working less than
three-quarter time dealt with the output.
So far as profits are concerned, the intro-
ductory table shows almost as much as can
be gained from the balance-sheet. But this
may throw some further light on the matter:

Surplus .. £472,456 £654,672 £737,123 £806,015
The big roll added to cash during the year
came chiefly from sale of share holdings.
Paid capital is £1,289,195, in £1 shares, and
the surplus of liquid and semi-liquid assets
is equal to 12s. sd. Then there are the sub-
sidiaries, and shares in other cos. amounting
to just on £700,000, and the North mine
and the old Lyell, and plant and railways.
The value of these in future will be governed
by the copper market; and that is a mystery
beyond man’s fathoming. While an imme-
diate marked improvement in copper is un-
likely, the more stable conditions in Europe
—and especially in Germany—must have
their effect on the market. As at Sept. 30,
1923, Lyell held 2666 fully-paid £5 shares
in Birkenhead Wharf, and 214,265 paid £1
def. ords. in Electrolytic Zinc. Last year
the co. sold the former; and most of its
holdings of the latter went to shareholders
at 16s. per share, the balance being got rid
of satisfactorily. The surplus from these
sales was transferred to reserves. The co.’s
principal investments, other than bonds, now
consist of its holdings in Wallaroo-Mt. Lyell
Fertilisers, Ltd., and Metal Manufactures,
Ltd. —book values last year, £102,150 and
£75,128 respectively.
As mentioned above, George Swinburne is
now chairman of the co. Bowes Kelly, who
had asked to be allowed to retire, was one
of the promoters of the co.. was its first
chairman, and, with one brief interruption,
occupied the position for over 30 years.
Through all the long period of big money-
making he never ceased to be human, and
the admirable relations which for so many
unbroken years subsisted between co. and
men were largely due to his influence.

Lanarkshire broadcasts the cheering news
that its latest option near Coolgardie (W.A.)
has been manned with a view to an early
crushing. A good return may be obtained
and a call or two raked in as the result; but
as the reefs previously worked in the neigh-
borhood lost their gold at shallow depth, and
as this loss of value is characteristic of the
Coolgardie field, shareholders should not be
too optimistic if such a yield is obtained.
Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) hopes to have
a fair-sized cake for Christmas, and another
div. is expected before long. Apart from this
show there is little activity on Kanowna. Its
two former chief reefing mines, the White
Feather and North White Feather, are para-
lysed, while most of the other old-time pro-
ducers were laid to rest long ago. A rich
patch was struck in the Robinson mine the
other day, but so far the wealth exposed is
small. Years ago this property produced a
lot of gold. But the shoot, like most other
shoots on the field, died out at shallow 7 depth.
* * * *
Hansel Mundy is again looking for a mine.
Few mining cos. have wmndered more about
Australia in search of gold than this one, and
fewer still have been associated with such a
lot of failures. For some months past Han-
sel Mundy has been looking at a venture
at Wiluna, but when it was called upon the
other day to fulfil labor conditions and pay a
deposit it suddenly decided to move on.
After a long season of call-paying and high
finance, Ives Reward lias commenced treat-
ment in a sort of a way. The pipe line that
convevs water for milling is giving trouble,
and so is the plant generally. Labor is
scarce, gold shoots short, values not on the
high side, and there is a dead horse in the
form of borrowed money to work off. A
long period of developmental operations has
yielded a good supply of broken ore; also
there is a considerable quantity of easily-
accessible stuff in the stopes. Working costs
will thus appear low until available mill sup-
plies have been treated, but after that they
will probably have a big rise and shares a
sudden and heavy fall.
* * * *
Emu Co., with a strong supporting Adelaide
crowd, is going to do some boring on its
options at Wiluna. The co. controls the
most promising leases outside those being
shaft-tested by Collier’s London syndicate.
In view of results disclosed by bores on the
main leases, proposed Emu operations have
a good chance of striking something satis-
factory—that is, if high assay values obtained
from bore cores can be accepted as satis-
factory.

Perth shareholders in Borneo Oil Options
are agog at receipt of three beer-bottles of
what no doubt is crude petroleum under seal
of G. A. Hogenraad, petroleum engineer,
commissioned to report on the Borneo Con-
cessions. Hogenraad states he took the stuff
from seepages he found on the concession
areas. The stuff has been passed on to Dr.
Simpson, State analyst. Doubtless Simp-
son will say it is 0.K., but that won’t settle
the question of quantity. Still, so far as
official reports and samples go, the Borneo
Option crowd has nothing to complain of.

The first truckload of briquettes for public
consumption has reached Melbourne from the
Yallourn State brown-coal mine. Monash
promises that they will be sent in ever-
increasing volume. Unless he cuts prices he
will soon find that small consignments will
suffice. According to the old estimate they
were to be on sale at 255. a ton. They are
actually quoted at 51s. 6d., against best New-
castle coal at 555. So even with open-cut
work, German mechanics, and a haul of
only 80 miles, briquettes are to be available
at but 3s. 6d. a ton less than Maitland coal,
which has to be railed to the seaboard, then
loaded into steamers, taken south 1000 miles,
unloaded again and carted from the wharves
to the depots. Melbourne’s dream of cheap
fuel appears to be shattered, and with it the
dream of Monash of knocking out N. S.
Wales coal supremacy in the Cabbage
Garden. That is, unless the present price is
a to test the ground, or unless—dread
possibility ! —some mining experts are trans-
ferred to Yallourn-to cheapen the whole
mining scheme.

“Values continue to improve,” says J.
Mackay, regarding New Langi Logan (Vic.).
For the six months 1131 fathoms yielded
19840 z., or an average of 35dwt., which
ought to satisfy the biggest glutton in deep-
lead work. The nigger in the wood-heap, of
course, is that 10 times the footage should
have been sent to the machines. Off No. 4
rise 260 fathoms averaged 38dwt., so that a
bit of wonderfully good stuff was stoped.
Now the job is to hustle up No. 5 rise and
connect with No. 4 -workings. This will
give air and let the high-grade stuff be
tackled. It all means three months’ heavy
work and more calls, with good ground being
extracted to pay wages. Already the bank
is owed £.2570, and as Cohen won’t lend
much on mining plant shareholders can ex-
pect a call. Already £205,812 is at the debit
of working account. Most of that total has
come in driblets from backers of the mine.
Yet they have never had a div.’ and don’t
appear to be within reach of one unless labor
works harder and the southern end of the
claim keeps at the 2oz. mark.

That old-timer, the Preamimma, near
Callington (S.A.), has been measured up by
Chief Mines Inspector Winton. It goes back
to 1854, and has made four industrial
advents, all of them full of sorrows. Trouble
has been over the arsenic contents of the
copper ore; but things are so changed that
arsenic now is the attraction. Consequently
the old shaft is unwatered to 300 ft. and the
footwall side of the big ore body is being
tested. Winton advises that attention be
given also to the western formation.

B. D. Reynolds and A. G. Black have
snapped up 1000 acres below the Renison Bell
mine (Tas.) to work the Stanley River
drifts for monozite. They estimate to get
20s. to 225. 6d. per cub. yd. from the sands
at a working cost of Is. 6d. Recoveries -have
yet to prove these figures.
* * * *
Preolenna Coal (Tas.) is to have a rest
while, two sawmills are put to,Work. The
seam is too thin and too sulphurous to be
all that it was said to be. So far as timber
goes, the co. has 20.000 acres of dense forest
to work, and from it two mills are expected
to give profits of £2OO a week. To pay the
machinery man the co.’s capital has been in-
creased by 10s. a share, but only 2s. 6d. is to
be called up just now, and special authority
will also have to be got before more is called.

The Palmer Alluvial Syndicate, which
owns a five-mile stretch of the Palmer River
between Feruhill Creek and Glenroy Creek,
has been amalgamated by Arthur Clarke,
of Cairns (N.Q. ), with the Russell and John-
stone Rivers Dredging Co. The latter is
at a standstill, the boring of its area having
proved all the values to be in the surface
wash only, down to a depth of 4ft. Although
rich, it is not payable as a dredging venture,
and another type of plant is being looked
for. A company of £lOO,OOO in 100,000
shares is being formed. Palmer Alluvial
shareholders get 20,000 paidg for their area,
and Russell River shareholders, on payment
of 6d. per share, receive contribs paid up to
4s. 6d. They hand over their area on the
Russell together with their boring plant. The
public is being offered 10,000 shares—3d. on
application and 3d. on allotment. Walter
Baker is to bore the area on the Palmer
which was investigated in April last by C. H.
Wray and taken up by him for the old syn-
dicate. Of present capital, contribs. account
for £65,000; and 5000 shares are held in
reserve. Uncalled capital amounts to
£57,375, of which the public's share is £97s<>,
the remainder falling on the shareholders of
the amalgamated cos. That has a reassur-
ing look, but only the bores and pits will
decide whether the Palmer is to get on the
map again.
* * * *
The Billy Hughes (Normanby, Q.) is
ready for its next move. Of a recent issue
of second prefs., 10,000 were taken up, and
the Itesurgam, which is down 70ft. on the
edge of the sulphide body, will have its shaft
continued to 100 ft., and a level driven on
the mundic. At the 50ft. level, which is in
22ft., a foot of ore is exposed in the face;
a small crushing returned 3oz. to the ton.
This level is to be pushed ahead, and a fair
tonnage of good ore is expected from the
stopes.
* * * *
The meeting of Lander Oil, Roma (Q.),
was much less stormy than the barometer
indicated. The question of who dropped the
iron which plugged the first bore was not
settled ; but the report that the second bore
has reached 960 ft. and is going well served
to appease some of the more belligerent
shareholders. Duncan Milsom having long
since disappeared from the field management,
the meeting decided to lean upon manager
A. E. Allen and the boring staff, in the hope
that No. 2 bore will end more happily than
No. 1. The five retiring directors were re-
elected after a ballot.

Just when favorable metal prices had given
the Barrier mines a chance to make up for
lost time, the unions have become restive.
The W.I.U.A. is reported to have strength-
ened its position, amalgamated with the
Trades and Laborers’ Union, and come to a
working agreement with the Engine Drivers.
The next move will be the presentation of a
log. Some months ago, Weir, for the cos.,
rejected a claim, but, with the unions fairly
solid, the union paper SQoling them on, and the
Barrier Miner advocating an increase on
a sliding scale for each £1 lead is over £25
a ton—the rate on which wages are based —•
it looks as if the cos. may have to concede
something. But there are big supplies of
concentrates at Port Pirie, enough to see out
an extended trouble should the unions insist
on impossible conditions.

Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) reports a loss
of £730 for the year to Oct. 31. Develop-
ment work absorbed £2536, of which £706
was contributed by the State Prospecting
vote. The chief “asset” is mine and pro-
perty, £20,753. The mine may be worth
that when the co. strikes the bonanza that is
being looked for. Not having done it so
far, the co. has had its work cut out placing
forfeited shares. To bait the hook it allotted
one for every two after the August call was
struck, and later a wad of 10,000 was placed
at 3d. net, the amount of the call due.

Production at the Golden Crown, at Yal-
wal, Nowra (N.S.W.), since the recent re-
vival, has been steady. The present co. is
in 4000 20s. shares, all of which were locally
subscribed, the Morton family being solidly
interested. Tom Heron, who is managing,
has been associated with Yalwal for over 30
years. The co. is tunnelling on a lode 12ft.
wide and returning about 6dwt. in the bat-
tery, and prospects look so good that a sale
to a bigger concern is being considered. A
quarter of a century ago a tribute party
netted £15,000, and then sold for £9OO to
another tribute crowd, which in turn netted
over £lO 000. Then the original co. put up
£lOOO to buy the tributors out—and left it
in the ground. It is an erratic district.

Ratrut Basin Tin Dredging Co. lost £4590
for the year to May 31 after treating 445,000
cubic yards for 101 tons tin oxide—about
Boz. to the yard. The actual mining period
was not much above six months, owing to
the sinking of the dredge in June last year
After writing off the loss on the year, the
eo. carried forward £9414. Much improve-
ment in the finances has since been effected,
recent yields coming up to 30 tons a month.
The co. has a subscribed capital of £150,513
in £1 shares, which have moved from ss. 9d.
to 7s. 3d. on recent operations.

“Boronia” : The perspiring bush M.C. who
was wont to invite the blokes to select their
partners for “th’ firs’ set,” and to bawl un-
intelligible directions during the subsequent
gyrations, will soon be a thing of the past.
His job is being rendered superfluous by
Dave and Tilly’s growing fondness for the
fox-trot, jazz and similar exercises. The
good old bush darnces with their majority
of “squares” are fading out. It is quite
common now to sec only one set on the pro-
gramme at many out-back hops. Recently I
noticed a once-famed M.O. looking diseonso-

“Barbed Wire”: Fritz was not without
humor. While the fourth divvy was entrain-
ing at Bapaume to go north for the Messines
stunt, a party of enemy prisoners were
working in the railway yards. Brushing up
my fifth-form German, I remarked genially
to the toilers: “Wir gehen macli Berlin

“Als ein prisonier?” (As a prisoner?) the
nearest of them returned stolidly.

“Herodot”: As the deadliest weapon in
a brawl at close range I nominate the steel
hook frequently worn by men who have lost
a hand. Strapped on to the stump of the
amputated limb, it is an implement of offence
that leaves' knuckledusters nowhere. Re-
cently. in a N.S.W, mining township, a
Saturday-night mix-up began outside the
pub. The losing side despatched a hurried
call fbr reinforcements: they came led by
an undersized individual with a metal hook
where a right hand had once been. Plung-
ing into the fray, he soon cleared a space
around him, and by jabbing at the faces of
his opponents and swinging sideways con-
verted most of the enemy into casualties.
When the police managed to restore order
there were nine men needing surgical atten-
tion ; they shared 54 stitches between them.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Cases of robbery with vio-
lence are liable to be exaggerated by the
natural desire of the victims to garnish with
a few trimmings a tale that otherwise might
be regarded as a reflection on their own cour-
age. Binks, surprised in a dark corner,
yields liis possessions without a struggle.
But, as he rushes away subsequently to re-
port the incident, he decides that the real
story does him no credit; so, instead of re-
porting his midget assailant truthfully, he
describes him as a massive brute, or three
or four of them, armed with dangerous wea-
pons, and probably adds that in the mix-
up he left his mark upon the robbers. A
pawned watch put the police on to the track
of a man who had been described as a burly
ruffian bearing visible marks of some severe
punishment; actually the wanted person proved
to be a weed with a partially-useless left arm.
He admitted pawning the watch, but declared
that he had merely at the outset begged for
a couple of shillings, and had only gone
further when the citizen he approached
treated the incident as a hold-up and showed
an inclination to yield without a struggle.
The catching of the thief must be the last
thing desired by some of the people who
have pictured themselves as having fought
heroically against desperate odds.
“P.X.”: A “Chi-
nese doctor” is in
trouble in Maori-
land. A woman
who might have
been cured went to
him with goitre.
He gave her a
white-man propri-
etary medicine with
opium in it, and
ordered such vast
doses that within
12 months she was
a morphia fiend. I
know another case
in which a Chinese
quack put his trust
in the White-man’s
medical armory. He
had succeeded to
his father’s practice
in a Vic. goldfields
town, and wasn’t
doing too well —
competition was
very keen. Then in
some way or other
he acquired a bar-
row-load of most
portentous - looking

ture, the out-of-
date discards from
a medical man’s
library, and these
volumes he dis-
played in his wait-
ing-room. Soon the
word went round
that Sin Now was
offering his clients
the wisdom of both
East and West.
The crowd in his
waiting-room grew
larger every month,
and Sin Now was
soon able to afford
to burn as many
candles as his com-
petitors. He made
a fortune; the man
who discarded the

“Percy Pawnticket”: A parson who re-
cently mentioned in his evidence at a Mel-
bourne bigamy trial that he was paid his
marriage fee with a valueless cheque might
have been worse off. A flamboyant ’groom
of a few years ago so impressed the officiat-
ing clergyman with his affluence that the
cleric cashed a substantial cheque for his
altar-rail customer, deducting his fee there-
from. Nor were his suspicions awakened
until a taxi-driver came back and deposed
that the ’groom had assured him that the
cleric, as an old friend, would pay the fare.
The cheque, of course, was worthless, but
what made his reverence’s cup of bitterness
slop over wfs that the bride turned up
weeks later, with a tale of desertion and rob-
bery, to unload some of the blame on him.
She understood, she said, that it was a par-
son’s duty to satisfy himself about the char-
acter of any man he married.

“Capricorn”: North Queensland is get-
ting less isolated. The other day the re-
maining gap in the State’s great northern
railway was filled, and it is now possible to
travel by train from Meekatharra (W.A.)
to Cairns and thence inland to Chillagoe. The
delay in completing the last section from
Innisfail (once Geraldton) to Cairns was
caused by the necessity for bridging the
Johnstone liiver, a great tropical stream sub-
ject to tremendous floods. The opening of
the bridge was made the occasion of a “func-
tion,” as they now call a spree in the North.
Some thousands of people came by train from
the southern towns, while Cairns and the
Etheridge, Atherton and many another centre
dropped a day’s work to attend. And next
morning all the Johnstone River crocodiles
were suffering from indigestion caused by a
surfeit of empty bottles.

“Banquo” : I don’t remember the Fisher’s
Ghost, at Nunawading (Vic.), of whom “J.
Drayman” writes (B. 4/12/’24) ; but surely
the Fisher’s Ghost to whom a Sydney aider-
man likened Mr. Cropley was the Campbell-
town (N.S.W.) member of the family.
Fisher was a farmer, “free >y servitude,”
who shared a house with one George Wor-
rell. In July, 1826, Fisher disappeared and
Worrell took possession of his property. The
general impression was that Fisher had re-
turned to England secretly (being forbidden
by law. as an ex-convict, to do so openly),
find had left Worrell to act for him. But
in October, 1826, a neighbor named Farley
declared that ho had seen the ghost of Fisher
sitting on a post-and-rail fence near the
house where Worrell now lived alone, and
that the spirit had beckoned to him, and
pointed over its shoulder towards a creek.
The story came to the ears of a magistrate,
and a constable and two black trackers were
sent out with Farley. For what followed
we have the evidence of the constable as
recorded in the notes of Chief Justice Foi'bes.
They found traces of blood on the rail on
which the ghost had appeared, and then
searched in the direction in which the ghost
had pointed. When they came to a water-
hole Gilbert, one of the abos., passed a stalk
of maize over the water, put it to his nose
and said: “I smell the fat of a white man.”
Gilbert then led the constable up a creek
and along a tributary for 40 rods. Then
he put a stick in the ground, saying: “There
is something here.” They dug and found
what was left of Fisher. Worrell was tried
for murder before Chief Justice Forbes.
Though the ghost was not admitted as a wit-
ness Worrell was found guilty. He confessed
to the murder, and was hanged on February
5, 1827.

“Toongooroo”: The other day there
arrived in Boulia, in the uttermost south-
west of Queensland, an old chap with a
push-bike. He looked a bit exotic, and in-
quiry elicited that when news of Mount Isa
blew into Ivalgoorlie it fanned the passions
of the old miner to such an extent that he
straddled his machine and hit the track for
North Queensland to have a look at the
new field for himself. He was not over-
impressed with it, and when questioned at
Boulia lie was overhauling his grid for the
return journey to Wcstralia.
“Scalpel” : An unusual operation was per-
formed at Hobart Public Hospital recently,
when a steel penholder, which had been
lodged in a boy’s lung for some months, was
extracted by the aid of a bronchoscope. This
last is a gadget which, introduced to the re-
spiratory passage, illuminates it and enables
a foreign body to he seen and withdrawn
by a special apparatus through the tube.
The boy had been ill for some time, and
t.b. had been diagnosed. When the hospi-
tal doctor asked him if anything had gone
the wrong way, the secretive kid owned up to
the penholder.

“Witness denied in cross-examination that he had
winked and slapped the alderman on the back and
closed the conversation with ‘W e’ll leave it at that.
Come and have a spot.’ ” —At the Civic Graft Com-
mission.
When you stand in the light that’s incessantly shed
On an alderman’s bald and benevolent head,
If your name you would shelter from evil report
You’ve got to be careful with whbin you consort.
There are chaps always ready to subtly convey
By sly innuendo far move than they’ll say.
Beware of the bird who concludes his remarks
On culverts and levels, on playgrounds and parks,
Or maybe on vacant municipal cribs,
With a wink of the eye and a dig in the ribs
And a jovial “Eh what? Will you join in a spot?”
That joker wants watching, more likely than not.
When in toil for your fellows all day you engage
With never a stiver of hire or of wage;
When nightly you sit on committee or board
With never a prospect of fee or reward;
When you work double tides for the public and deem
An adequate guerdon is public esteem;
When you yacker, sustained by the comforting glow
That martyrs to duty and altruists know ;
Remember that motives as noble and good
As yours before now have been misunderstood.
Watch out for the caller who after he’s made
Some simple request, as it seems, for your aid,
Desists from straightforward appeal or attack
With an eyelid that flutters, a smack on the back
And a wish to be notified whether or not
The time hasn’t come for a sociable spot—
It sounds harmless enough, but it may mean a lot.

“71’.N.” : There were few of us who didn’t
see some quaint but very touching matesliips
during the Great Horror. Darkey was one
of those big, quiet-going Diggers who never
had much to say, but who gave the impres-
sion that there was considerable storage in
their reserves. Early in the piece he llad
picked up with little Harry (lovers, a kind
of mascot to the battalion, who had
started life as a waif in the Sydney slums.
The two were inseparable, and often at the
end of a wearing day’s march the big fellow
could be seen carrying the little one's pack
in addition to his own. I had lost sight
of the pair for some weeks, and then I ran
across Darkey near Romerin after the
Bassckendaele stunt. Naturally I asked after
Harry. "Blobbed out on Wosthock Ridge,
was all the answer I got; and somehow I
knew that was all I ever would get from
Darkey. I heard the full story later from
another chap. Harry’s issue had been a full
one: there wasn’t enough of him left to make
a stretcher-bearer’s job. Soon after the shell
burst a burly figure shouldered its way into
NEXT OF KIN.
“So your name's Pearl, eh? Are you the Pearl of Great Price?”
“Oh, no —she was my cousin. I’m the one that was cast before
the swine.”
the little group where the company com-
mander was. A quick gesture that the live-
witted captain recognised as a salute and
something behind the man’s eyes brought that
officer to his feet. A little while later the
figure was picking its way over the shell-
holes and broken barbed-wire to the rear,
bearing something in a sandbag. In a quiet
spot beside the Menin-road the funeral party
of one buried its burden and returned to
the line. A few evenings later, in the dusk,
a little wooden cross appeared on the spot.
But the big inarticulate infantryman had
only two words for it all. Ilis best friend
had “blobbed out”—nothing more.
“Schnorrer” : Not many Jews in Australia
have heard the call of Palestine, but the
Australian gum-tree is already recognised as
a useful colonist. It is making a new glory
in Zion, decorating the plains of Askalon,
and extending its sway to Jordan s banks. A
little Jewish colony at Nahalal celebrated
its third anniversary the other day—it is
run on group-settlement lines, with 75 fami-
lies engaged in farming and 23 persons work-
ing as doctors, teachers, storekeepers ana
clerks. There is now a thriving and healthy
settlement where once was a malarial swamp,
and one of the proudest records of Nahalal
has been the planting of 30,690 eucalyptus*
trees.

“Verri” : Without detracting from the per-
formances of the Maorilanders who have been
distinguishing themselves in the wireless
world, it must be remembered that Dominion
enthusiasts work under extraordinarily favor-
able conditions. A theory once prevailed
that these conditions were due, in the case
of British signals, to Maoriland being almost
antipodal; but the French frigate Aldebaran
exploded this idea some time ago when it
found messages from French stations coming
to hand with the same facility. During the
war the Bluff station frequently picked up
messages from enemy ships in the North Sea
which had not been intercepted in England:
and there seems to be no reason why Bill
Massey shouldn’t exchange greetings with
King George any night of the week.

“Leamington”: A casual Australian
dropped into Maitland (N.S.W.) the other
day and endeavored to recall himself to a
citizen who has conducted a saddlery busi-
ness in the town for over half a century.
In the late ’seventies, it appeared, he had
purchased a seven-aiid-sixpenny whip at this
establishment, and lie arranged to pay on
his next visit, which he was now making.
The vendor could not remember the trans-
action or find any record of it, and was a
bit reluctant to accept the money, but the
stranger insisted on paying. To show how
firmly the liability was impressed on his mind
he mentioned the exact period that had
elapsed since the deal —it was in October or
November, 45 years ago, that he made it.

“C. Coral”: The Torres Strait still gives
up relics of its Spanish visitors of long
ago. A few weeks
back, while the
natives were dig-
ging a kumalla gar-
den on the hill
overlooking Medi-
gee Bay, on Darn-
ley Island (where
are the curious
stone fish-weirs
that puzzle in-
quirers), they un-
earthed a finger-
ring bearing a tiny
unsheathed dagger ;
and some little dis-
tance away the hoe
flung out a Span-
ish coin carrying
the inscription
“Carolus IV. - ' and
the date 1790.
From time to time
Spanish coins have
been found on Mur-
ray Island, some HO
miles away. A
find of a different
nature was made
by a party of
natives swimming
for trochus-shell
round Bramble Cay
last month; they
came on the re-
mains of two ves-
sels, a sailing-ship
beneath, with a
steamer lying right
across it. They
brought in a quan-
tity of copper fit-
tings, also a brass
plate bearing the
inscription “Wind-
hover, Glasgow.”
Does anyone know
anything about
her? The remains
of a third vessel lie
a few fathoms
away, so it is diffi-
cult to say just which wreck the plate came
from.

“Cameliar”: The only redeeming feature
of the aeroplane from a combatant’s point
of view used to be that the much-disliked
machine gave timely and decent warning of
its coming. The Eight Horse in Sinai and
Palestine appreciated the warning hum of
the propeller to the full, for it usually enabled
them to get their beloved mounts _ well
scattered before the bombs fell. That is all
off now, if it is a fact, as reported by cable,
that a British inventor has at last found
a method of cutting out the noise without
interfering with engine power. If he has
done it he has added still one more unplea-
santness to the profession of arms.
“H ase n” : As
some wiseacre ha 3
said, it’s all in the
point of view. Even
the magic of hill
and sea and sky
that waits the tra-
veller on this ocean
lake between
Queensland and the
Barrier Beef held
no power over little
Jobson. When the
mate pointed to a
solitary island that
humped a grey
shoulder through
the unbroken blue
of the water, Job-
son gave it no
more than a tired
glance. “A re-
turned soldier and
his wife live there,”
s aid the mat e,
“Alone. Raise pigs
or goats or some-
thing. All they see
of the world is the
supply-ship that
brings stores from
Mackay once a
month.” The lone
island, aloof and
mysterious in its
clinging haze, be-
came at once a
thing of romance.
The newly-married
pair sighed as with
one breath. “That’s
wonderful!” gushed
the foolish young
man, shooting a sly,
tender glance at
the rosy face of tin;
beloved. “R ig h t
away from every-
body. Husband and
wife in a little
world of their own.
Just imagine it!”
“flood Lord,” sud-
denly interrupted
the mate, “what’s
the matter, Mr.
Jobson V” Little
Jobson’s face was set in lines of acutest
pain. For one illuminating moment Ins eyes
turned along the deck towards the distant
but still-commanding figure of Mrs. Jobsoji.
“I was just imagining it,” lie whispered in
an awed voice.

“Sixenate”: Judge Williams 1ms beeu
rightly condemning in a Melbourne County
Court case a very bad habit into which
judgment creditors have fallen. -Cue * ic-
torian law gives the debtor fair latitude,
it doesn’t believe in throwing him into gaol
if he is honestly unable to pay except m
small instalments; but the creditor who
grows impatient may bring the debtor to
court in order to get a higher order. It is
quite common for affidavits to be hied assert-
ing that the man who owes the money is in
a position to pay up; but in this case Judge
Williams demanded to be informed of the
basis of the creditor's belief. Being in-
formed that the swearing of such an affidavit
was a “mere formal matter,” his Honor
tartly remarked that perjury wasn t. a for-
mal matter, and dismissed the application,
with a warning that something unpleasant
might happen if the bad habit were persisted
in It was only a couple of days later that
the Judge was given an opportunity to prove
lie was in earnest. Dismissing another ap-
plication of a similar nature, he awarded
the defendant costs to cover the loss of his
day’s work in having to attend the court.

“Fite” • The amalgamation of the C., R.
and M. R. Co. and John Sec and Co., in
August, 1891, under the title of the North
Coast Steam Navigation Co., brought to-
gether three very big men as skippers. Cap-
tain R. Taplin, who measured 62in. round
the chest, master of the Burrawang. was a
Dalesman from Westmoreland; Captain F.
Magee, of the City of Grafton, an Irishman;
and Captain R. Evans, a Welshman, who
commanded the Coraki. A few w T eeks after
the merging the three big skippers arrived
at Sydney wharf from the Macleay, Clarence
and Richmond respectively within a few

minutes of each other. As usual they re-
ported at head office that their slaps had
berthed. They were then instructed to pro-
ceed to the co.’s tailors and get measured tor
new dress uniforms. All three went along
together, and on the way decided to put up
a joke on the tailor. Captain Evans went
up first. The tailor’s foreman was volume.
“My vort, Captain Evans, you vas a fane
man. You have a pig chest —and ze arms .
“Oh,” said Evans, “I’m only a baby—wait
till you see the others. There’s nine more,
and tliev are all bigger men than I. Cap-
tain Magee strolled in as Evans came out.
The tailor was astounded. “My!” he ex-
claimed. “I thought Captain Evans vas a
fine man; but you are bigger in the chest, m
the arms —all over.” "That’s nothing -I m
only one of the little ones. There s eight
more to come —all bigger than me, replied
Magee. Then Captain Taplin appeared. As
the tailor ran over his measurements he re-
marked that he had thought that Captains
Evans and Magee were fine men, but Captain
Taplin beat them by inches—chest, arms,
waist. “Oh, that’s nothing,” said Taplin.
“There’s seven bigger men yet.” “Mine
Gott.” sighed the tailor “is that so? Ve lose
on the job then.” The next to turn up was
Captain Livingstone, the Tom Thumb of the
company’s skippers.

When the argument was quiet
in Palestine some lucky regiments had a ride
down to Rujin El Bahr, where the sainted
Jordan runs into the Dead Sea. The water,
25 p.c. salt, is so buoyant that an egg will
float in it; the horses, used to a dip in
fresh water or even the Mediterranean,
seemed comically astonished at floating so
high. Some <D million tons of water are
supposed to flow into the Dead Sea daily
from various streams, and the whole of it
has to be carried off by evaporation, which
gives some slight idea of the intense licat
under which fighting took place in those
parts. In that same Jordan Valley a hor-
ribly prickly shrub abounds, from the for-
midable thorns of which the native Arabs
will tell you that Christ’s crown was made.
I often used to wonder, when riding through,
the choking dust-clouds of the valley, or
crouching among the burning rocks with the
bullets chipping sparks from the boulders,
whether the day was hot when Tic toil 'd up
the valley under the crown. Close by old
Jericho grows a small shrub with broad,
green leaves woolly-looking on the under
side. The fruit is the famous Apple of
Sodom.

Contented to be “plain.”
You think that he’ll have answers none,
That such an ad. will vex?
’Tis precious little then, my son,
You know about the sex.
A score of applicants will deem
lie’ll like their modest air,
And fairer in his eyes they’ll seem
For knowing not they’re fair 1
But when his treasure is secured
Some doubt I must confess
Regarding whether he’s assured
Of married happiness.
First tiff that comes —and tiffs must be—
Will she (in tears) refrain
From “When you advertised for me—
You beast I —-you called me plain” ?

RELIEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The darkest day drags slowly to a finish ;
The longest road must somewhere reac h a gate ;
The railway miles with snort and whoop diminish ;
Waiters remove at last the tedious plate.
If endings and departings make life dreary,
They also help to make it somewhat bright;
Piano thumpers must at last grow weary,
And bed has pillows for the sternest night.
There is some decency about to-morrow ;
Doubt is the brightest sun that ever shone ;
And even now I find surcease of sorrow,
For, thank the Lord, that visitor is gone.

By King’s Birthday (June 3), if not
sooner. John Bowser. Speaker of Vic. Assem-

. Sydney's new Lord Mayor, Patrick Stokes
« unmarried native of Braidwood
(N.S.W.). and is 40. He lias repre-
sented Belmore Ward in the City Council
for six years, and knocks down second-hand
bedroom suites to the highest bidder in an
auction-room near the Central Railway Sta-
tion. In his youth he was a branch secretary
of the Enginedrivers and Firemen’s Union,
and stands a good chance of adding £6OO
j-ito.his just-acquired allowance of
iloOO by outing John Bailey, M.L.A. for
Goulburn. As an alderman he has been
conscientious in his attendance, and is re-
puted to be prudent and conservative in
business undertakings. All the same, wdien

Death came mercifully to T. W. Rolfe, of
ir-i-. wEo l as t week in Handwick
Military Hospital after living six years with-
out a skin. Mustard-gas was responsible
tor his terrible plight, and during all that
time lie has lain night and day in a bath of
running warm water, while attempts have
been made to grow a new skin. Everyone
who visited Randwick Hospital remembered
him afterwards for the splendid and uncon-
querable cheerfulness with which he bore
his dreadful burden. To people all over Aus-
tralia he symbolised the spirit of the A.I.F.
Vic. Chief Justice Irvine is coming home

delightful. In the Christmas Bulletin.
issued on Saturday—a few last copies of
which may still linger on a few bookstalls—
i>i ady is represented by a poem of pirate
days, and James Edmond by a superb piece
ot grotesque subtlety. In prose, the best
Australian work of the moment is being done
m the short story, and in this issue there is
mustered a collection which equals any pre-
Vious year’s gathering.
Maoriland lias just been to the funeral of
Joseph Grimmond, M.L.C., an old West
';' 0 ® pioneer and contemporary of Dick
heddon in the palmy days of the Golden
West. He was a long time Mayor of Ross,
and represented Westland in the House of
Reps, for 60 years till the readjustment of
boundaries brought him into the constitu-
ency held sacred to King Dick. In both
contests Seddon beat Joseph, and in 1018
the latter was called to the Upper House,
lie had passed his 81st milestone when he
dual. He was an Irishman, and arrived
m Melbourne in 1850 and worked on several
\ ictorian goldfields before crossing to M.E.
Tom Bright, dead at 72 after a long ill-
ness, was one of Adelaide’s most popular
citizens. He was a member of that remark-
able law firm which at various times saw
John Gordon become a Judge, James Gordon
® l )ollC( l magistrate and Paris Nesbit and
Janies Anderson K.C.’s—Nesbit is now the
only survivor. Bright himself latterly did
a lot of work as honorary S.M. and acting-
president of the Industrial Court. Stuart
and m E - 'J- Morgan carry on the
old firm Tom Bright’s life was well filled
outside his work with sport of all kinds, and
“ c ™a s . expert at every game of cards.
As .Bright of Clare” long ago lie was pro-
mment in country cricket and tennis; and
his carnations were famous.
Alfred Cornish, who has just claimed his
lot in Brighton cemetery (Vic.), was for
a quarter-century secretary of the Australian
Club, Melbourne, and rubbed shoulders
with wool kings,

who count. It was
difficult for those
who had accus-
tomed themselves to
regard him as just

“Fits:”: The first man to ride a bicycle in
Australia was _ Christy May, a one-time
farmer of Pitt Town, near Windsor
(N.S.W.). Christy May descended Brick-
field Hill, Sydney, on a “boneshaker” in the
year IS3G. Soon afterwards he rode down
George-street, Windsor, on the same machine,
to the prodigious wonderment of the Hawkes-
bury Cornstalks, who had never seen a
bicycle before. Next day the police magis-
trate, old Lieut. Bell, fearing a disturbance,
asked Christy May not to appear in public
again on his machine.

“D.M.”: My nomination for the Long-dis-
tance Organists’ Stakes is Miss Jane Reichon-
borg, of St. Joseph’s, Ilobart. I was one
of the singers at the complimentary concert
given in the Town Hall in July, 1914, to
celebrate the gentle, little white-haired lady’s
50th anniversary, and she is still pulling out

Fred. Spofforth, the “demon bowler” of 40
years ago. and a member of the lirst Aus-
tralian cricket team to visit England, is
coming to Australia by the Mooltan, leaving
London on December 19. The trip is for
pleasure, and the “demon” will be accom-
panied by wife and daughter. He hopes to
witness the second and third Test matches.
Spofforth was born in Balmain 71 years ago ■
his father was an old officer of the Bank of
N. S. Wales.
A dead cigarmaker:—
Sam Gompers, the wonderful little London Jew
who founded the American Federation of Labor and
ran it for 42 years, died last week while returning
from an industrial conference in Mexico. Gompers
was a favorite target for the slings and arrows of
Australian Labor editors. Ue kept his Federation
out of party politics and had no use for Socialism in
any of its forms. But he lived to see the
American workman become easily the highest-paid
toiler in the world, and a car-owner for the most
part. Which probably explains why Garden, Walsh,
’Owie and almost the entire body of Australian Labor
editors declare he was “a traitor to his class.”
“Zabut”: The cable about Colonel Huddle-
stone, the acting-Sirdar, walking unarmed
towards the Soudanese mutineers, comes as
no surprise to those who knew him in Pales-
tine. He was one of several excellent officers
who, either through lack of private means
to keep up their positions as subalterns in
the British Army or because they wanted
active experience, joined up with the Egyp-
tian Army with the rank of Bimbashi.
Amongst the others were Gen. C. L. Smith,
V.C., and Colonels De Lancy Forth, New-
come and Joyce. Huddlestone was given
command of the 3rd Battalion I.C.C. only
three days before he was to go into a scrap
with them; but by the time the scrap was
over he had gained a reputation for cool brav-
ery and a nickname. During the 1 fight—it
was at Rafa, oil Jan. 9, 1917 —he wore a pair
of slacks tied just below the knees with
pieces of string. He was “Bowyang Bill”
from that time forward to all the Aussics
m . tlic corps. He carried a stick, and set
such a pace m the final rushes against the
redoubt that there were few who would
have had time to bayonet a Turk had the
opportunity presented itself.
Alderman Ivilgour, Newcastle’s retiring
Mayor, is a taciturn individual, as aldermen
go, with a self-control that masks the vol-
canic temper usually to be found in bushy-
eyebrowed men of rufous complexion. New-
castle has had much to thauk him for. He
has been an efficient mayor, and his char-
acter entirely lacks the corkscrew qualities
of some municipal politicians. The Coal
wa \ therefore, pained when he tore
off his robes after his defeat the other day
and departed from the Council Chamber
hurling accusations at his colleagues of hav-
ing played him false.” Alderman Light
who ejicceeds vigour, is a Newcastle shop-
Ernest Farrar, Nationalist Minister for
Labor in the N.S.W. Upper House, takes on
the color of Ins environment so easily and
naturally that no one notices the change.
A saddle-maker by trade, lie learnt mool-
classing as a side-line. Thirteen years g
he was an outspoken president or the xiaats
and Labor Council. He was a little dressier
and wore his hat somewhat straighter tnan
his predecessors. At an eight-hour banquet
in those days lie spoke bravely of a dri-hour
week. In 1916 he signed the Universal Ser-
vice declaration, and Labor pals would n t
have it that this only meant conscription ot
wealth. Anyway he was soon a talkative mem-
ber at Nationalist conferences, and blended
so well that they made him a vice-president.
It was this fact that probably got him into
the Ministry, where it became his job to
legislatively add another four hours to the
44-hour week, and in his new company he
did it without turning a hair. As a pos-
sible Nationalist selection for that last re-
fuge of sinners, North Sydney, lie can bo
relied upon to advocate the views of the
North, whatever they are.
From a Labor student:—
The ballot for the live Labor candidates to contest
the next Senate election in N. S. Wales, although
proceeding with outward calm, is being fought with
bitterness underneath. In former Senate pre-selection
fights the candidates have generally focussed atten-
tion on Labor leagues and bothered little about the
trade-union vote; this time all three parties—
Industrialists, A.W.U. and Executive supporters—
and also the independents are canvassing among the
unions. Willis’s miners, who conduct their ballots
at the pit-mouths, are being courted by the Indus-
trialists, who are still sore over the refusal of the
executive to admit Commun’sts within the A.L.P.
Those favored by the Reds include Donald Grant, who
did four years in gaol over the I.W.W. business;
J. C. Eldridge, who would have run McGirr’s Mother-
hood Endowment Department had the Labor Party
gone back in 1922 ; Gibbs, assistant sec. of the
A.L.P. ; “Digger” Dunn; and O’Dea, secretary
of the Shop Assistants’ Union. The A.W.U.,
which does most of its voting by pose,
is represented by T. P. Holloway, a promi-
nent Baileyite; W. F. Bodkin, a youth of 21 or so;
J B. Dooley, of Burrinjuck; and J. J. Lynch, en
organiser in the Railway Branch. “Jupp” Gardiner
is seeking re-selection, and has allied himself with
Tom Brown, ex-M.H.R. for Calare, and Captain T,
P. Conway, one time a Uni. lecturer on military
subjects. These three are the executive pets, and
are making a bold bid under the banner of “Aus-
tralia First.” The “Trammies’ ” man is their secre-
tary, A. C. Warton. Prominent among the re-
mainder of the 21 candidates are Harry Jones, who
is well in with the miners, and has an eye on
Willis’s job as secretary; Tom Thick, an anti-
deportation agitator and founder of the Irish Self-
Determination League; Jack White, Bailey’s bitterest
opponent in the A.W.U. ; and Duncan Smith, a
popular country league member. Gardiner and
Dunn look sure, but the other three are most likely
to be either Industrialists or A.W.U. men—they are
ex< hanging preferences to keep out the followers of
Lang.
An immigrant of an uncasual type is
saying good-bye to Australia for a time;
lie intends to return for good later on.
IL Meade Brown, a slight but energetic
youth, was commissioned by an Knglisli news-
paper to go to Australia and wander up and
down to ascertain what chances the country
offered to young Fnglishman without
money. Starting
from Melbourne in
August of last year,
he lias covered five
thousand miles per
boot, his furthest
north being Cairns.
With two mates
picked up in Aus-
tralia, he took any
sort of work that
was going, and
added to his earn-
ings by giving lec-
tures. Now he is
off to Singapore,
from which he in-
tends to do some,
more tramping;
after that his inten-
tion is to return
and settle in
Queensland.

Howard Ash, of Newcastle, has been ap-
pointed a director of the Newcastle and
Hunter River S. S. Co., vacant by the death
of E. A. M. Merewether. It seems appro-
priate. The late Frederick Ash, founder of
the firm which Howard Ash now controls,
was a passenger from Melbourne to New-
castle on the s.s. Dandenong when she was
wrecked in the “Dandenong Gale,” Sept. 11,
I'SiG. Many lives were lost, and Ash was
mourned as being of them; but a couple of
days later a barque rounded Nobby’s with
•Ash and a few others aboard—they had been
rescued from the sinking steamer. But
there were 40 who never saw land again.

“Ledraw”: “ J.C.” is wrong when lie says
toms and tabbies do not breed after going bush.
When I was rabbiting I several times dug out
litter of kittens, and my dogs killed dozens of
half-grown cats. The station was 20 miles from
camp and the nearest township 18, and not even
the most sensitive tabby would have come that
distance to use a rabbit burrow as a maternity ward.
“Troophorse”: Now that Christmas is
approaching perhaps some of the bachelor members
of the Council may be glad of this simple prepara-
tion of cocoanut yeast. It is quite a change from
the usual hops, potato and other vegetable yeasts
made by bush housewives. Secure an empty beer
WASN'T RISKING IT.
JACKEROO : “Billy, the boss wants you to come up and mind the
house on show-day. There's a lot of thieves following
the show."
KING BILLY: “Yes, but who'll mind my plurry place?”
bottle, clean well and then place one tablespoonful
each of rice, flour and sugar, and half a teaspoonful
of fine table salt, in the bottle. Then procure a nice
young gran cocoanut and pour the juice into the
bottle, shake well and stand in the sun for three
hours. Set your bread at 9 p.m., with four large
mugfuls of flour in a basin or small bucket. Strain
off the fluid from bottle, mix well and stand in a
warm spot until early morning. Then knock it
back, leave half an hour, then knead, place in camp-
oven or tin and bake on the rise. To renew the
yeast bottle, place the sediment back in the bottle
and refill with fresh green cocoanut juice.
* * * *
“Te Whare”: Besides the chameleon and
the gold and green bell-frog, mentioned by “Rana”
(B. 23/10/’24), there are certain Australian lizards
which have the power of changing color instant-
aneously to match the general tintings of their sur-
roundings. The water-lizard, or “water-goanna,”
common about most coastal and some inland rivers,
has pale green, pale brown, and purplish-brown in
his toilet-set, and assumes these tintings automatically
When stretched on a willow bough, for instance, he
becomes greenish, and the first indication of his
presence is usually a sounding splash as he plumps
into the water and disappears. The small white-
striped lizard, again, a very tame species, which
you may pick up and stroke, changes from pale
whitish-brown to a dark brown when it lies in
shadow, while the marauding goanna (monitor lizard),
under similar circumstances, has a slighter power
of varying the color of his dress-suit to a darker
shade. Fish also exhibit color variations, but I
think in this case the change is gradually made.
Thus black bream, living in the dark waters of
tidal and isolated salt lakes, are dull colored com-
pared with the (so-called) silver bream of the
sea —exactly the same fish —while fathead living
mainly on muddy bottoms are usually darker in
coloring than those caught in the sandy shallows.
• * * *
*‘Quintex”: A fishing mate and I on one
occasion at Bittangabee, an inlet just north of Green
Cape, contrived a much more effective method of
catching sharks than “Wewak’s” New I relander s
(B. 6/11/’24). Securing within a light canvas bag
the blood of a newly-killed bullock, we trailed it
behind a boat for some distance round and back
to a small clear-water cove, on the rocks of which
we had left a couple of rifles and a good supply of
ammunition. Incidentally, we had let that bag lay
in the boat for an hour or two before going out.
We were lucky to get back, for after a short time
we reckoned that all the sharks from Eden to the
La ices Entrance were after us. When the sport was
over we had bagged 32 sharks and had more exciting
sport than a couple of grey nurses would have
among a lot of fool bathers at Coogee. Don’t try
this experiment in a light boat too far from shore.
» * * •
“Colub": “Imbaga’s” statement that the
stones found in crocodiles’ interiors are swallowed
for the purpose of aiding digestion, and that they
have the power of ejecting them at will (B. 13/11/’24),
may clear up a mystery which puzzled a town
in North Queensland. A resident purchased from
some abos. a half-grown crocodile, and he placed it
in a cage in the grounds of his house. Several
weeks later somebody noticed a rounded stone,
four inches in diameter, in the cage; and as the
mesh of the netting was too small for the stone
to have been passed through, considerable specu-
lation was indulged in as to how it had got there.
This was increased a few days later when two more
stones were found, one of them much bigger, and
about a week afterwards still another made its
appearance. Various theories were suggested, but
it did not seem to strike anybody that the gibbers had
come from the croc, itself. Evidently they had
been swallowed by the latter in its wild state and
then disgorged when the change of diet made them
unnecessary to the croe.’s system.
• * * •
“FY7”: A goanna, startled by a dog, ran
up the hind legs of a young horse on which I was
drowsing. When I woke up I was so high in the
air that I could see the station roofs, four miles off,
over the tops of the cypress pines. On another
ocasion our storekeeper
was coming back from
the elections at Dir-
ranbandi. He was be-
hind schedule, and then
his horse arrived at the
homestead hurriedly,
with the necks of two
•whisky bottles flapping
on strings from me
saddle dees. Since die
nag was 15 years old
and about as nervous
as a grindstone, an ex-
planation was asked
when his rider, bruised
and thirsty, arrived on
foot. His story was
that, after he had come
through the six-mile
gate, he saw an im-
mense goanna in the
road, gazing at him iu
a menacing fashion.
Instinctively lie put Ids
hand in his coat pocket
and, pulling out a
bottle half-full of
whisky he was carrying
in case of snakebite,
threw it at his oppo-
nent, who leapt forth-
with on to the horse’s
back and bulled the
i icier to the ground, where he lost consciousness.
When he woke up the goanna had gone, leaving
the bottle empty, with the cork drawn, as subse-
quent independent investigation proved.
“Sucre’: “Nitric’s” 1501 b. Mclntyre River
cod (B. 0/11/’24) is a Scandinavian sardine com-
pared with some Condamine River (Warwick) sub-
marines. At the Bull Paddocks, Lyndhurst station,
a fisherman landed a sprat that jerked the steel-
yard to the 1951 b. point. Hamilton, who caught
this mite, told me there were three others in the
waterhole so big that they had to back in and out
of the channel to the bogey-hole. Charlie McDou-
gall, the late squire of Lyndhurst, brought another
weighing 1561 b. to Jerry Allman’s Criterion Hotel.
* * * *
“Pick”: As stated by “Saaedi” (B.
20/'ll/’24), a single pigeon sometimes will return to
the side of its fallen mate. But the greenshank
snipe do it in battalions. They will face death in
attempting the rescue of gun-wounded comrades, though
ordinarily they are extremely wary and shy. When
alighting in their migratory flights they cautiously
select an open space, removed from cover, and conse-
quently are difficult to approach. On the Wallaga
(N.S.W.) sandspit I once saw a gunman reach a
big flock of greenlegs by rolling before him a heap
of wind-drifted seaweed. Three wounded birds from
his shot struggled helplessly on the sand. The mob
almost darkened the air as they rose with terrified
cries, but immediately circled and, hovering over
their winged mates, settled again. As the gun
barked they darted about, fluttering over the slain
and making piteous efforts to assist the maimed.
Their terror and confusion were extreme, but their
devotion to their killed and crippled mates was
glorious.
CHRISTMAS PREPARA TIONS—WASHING-DAY.
“Portad”: Tell “Centre” (B. 13/11/’24)
that fox-terrier puppies are born without tails some-
times. I had a fox-terrier dog quite without a tail,
and at five years old he had only the semblance of a
knob in place of the usual appendage. This dog
was one of a litter of six, two of which were tailless.
“Pick”: At Bungendore (N.S.W.) Jack Bifield had
a bitch that provided the foxies for nearly every
rabbiter’s pack in the district. Almost invariably
amongst her litters there were two or three born
shorthandled. Also, on the eattleruns of Bibbenluke
station (Southern Tableland, N.S.W.), there once was
dropped a calf naturally provided with the dewlap
that for years had been the distinctive mark artificially
placed upon its ancestral herds. Ewes often drop
short-tailed lambs, though, to keep their youngsters
in the fashion, the mothers more often chew the
tails off as soon as the little fellows arrive.
“A.K.8.” : I possessed a lady foxy who in her first
litter of four pups had one with the regulation short
tail. The second litter of six pups contained three
snort-tails—one very short, one the regulation size,
and one about an inch too long. Had not a black
snake got her she might have produced a full litter
of shorts by this time. Still, it may have been a
case of inherited “transmission of acquired character-
istics,” as dad was also born with a cut-off tail.
“Artifex”: A pair of magpies built a nest
on one of the “girts” of the Government oil-drilling
plant at Roma (Q.), 60 feet above ground level. The
nest was made entirely of wires (out of the wire
cables) and pieces of vegetable roly-poly. The nest
and brood would have been left undisturbed, but
the maggies got vicious and used to tackle the
derrick man every time he went up to grease the
crown block, so it was thrown down. It was so
well constructed that the fall of 60ft. did not injure
it. A pair of peewits or magpie-larks also built just
under the crown block during a spell. When work
was resumed the parent bird that sat on the nest
was drenched with the muddy water coming off the
wire cable, so that you could generally see one or
two drab-colored birds flying about. But they stuck
to their job, and duly initiated two youngsters into
the art of flight.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: “T.V.T.” is right (B.
13/11/’24) —white ants will attack green or growing
timber. I was on the Batchelor Farm (N.T.) while
it was being run by the Government, and white ants
utterly ruined a crop of 14 acres of peanuts. They
ate through the shells and cleaned the kernels right
out. I have also seen growing maize and ambereane
attacked, but in these cases without any serious
results.
* * * *
“R.J.E.C.”: “The Wanderer” asks (B.
13/11/’24) as to the term “ringer.” The expres-
sion commemorates a mild phase of job-control in
the old-time sheds, the fastest shearer in those days
taking on himself the announcement of smoke-ohs
and knock-off time by ringing a bell. This explan-
ation is given in John Ryrie Graham’s book “The
Australian Merino,” published about 50 years ago
by Massina and Co., of Melbourne.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale”: Scrub wallabies are astute
animals. They learn to vault wire-netted fences and
worry the settlers’ crops, and when the cocky goes
forth seeking revenge he learns the effectiveness ol-
their uncanny system of thump signalling,
ouslv he is sneaking up on a browsing g lou P
•‘thump! thump!” he hears the resounding v. ac v
their tails on the ground perhaps behind him. me}
all instantly locate the danger zone, and lope
off to less dangerous surroundings. At nights, how-
ever, wallabies never signal, evidently trusting to
their protective coloring. On moonlight nights they
invariably graze in the shadows.
“Billy Brolga”: Yes, “T.V.T.” (B.
13/11/’24) is right. White ants do ajttack growing
timber. On the North Coast of Bananaland the
heart-wood of nearly every broad-leaf or mountain
ironbark is eaten out by termites to within Ave cr
six inches, and even less, of the sapwood, some of the
older but still growing trees being merely huge
shells. Forest hardwoods of almost every description
are attacked by white ants to a greater or lesser
extent, the losses to the country from this cause
amounting to millions of pounds annually. As
“T.V.T.” says, the pest also molests crops. In most
of the sugar-growing areas in Bananaland farmers
are frequently put to considerable expense and labor
in replanting areas of sugar-cane destroyed by the
ants, which attack the “sets” and also the plants
below the surface of the ground.
* * * *
“Yalamac”: “.T.G.” speaks through his hat
when he says (B. 6/11/’24) that there is no evi-
dence that domestic cats gone bush will mate. Of
course they mate, and why shouldn’t they? I have
frequently come across litters of kittens in logs
miles from any habitation, and know paddocks that
have been a breeding-ground for cats—black, tabby
and, occasionally, tortoise-shell —for years. Some of
these bush-cats grow to a huge size, and are a nasty
proposition for a dog to tackle. Birds seem to be
their chief diet, though they may be doing good work
in stemming the mouse-plague.
* * * *
“Mary Scott”: Is there anything in the
notion prevalent hereabouts (Central-North Queens-
land) that mango-trees bring Aeas when the fruit is
forming? Noticing a few of these artful dodgers
about recently where none had been before, I was
WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE.
FAT LADY : “Do you let out costumes?”
BATHING-SHES PROPRIETOR ( doing a lit of
weight-guessing ) : “Well, we don’t as a
reg’lar rule, mum. But I expect we’ll
have to hi your case.”
inclined to blame the fox-terrier; but a neighbor
declared the mango-trees in the yard responsible. Is
there any foundation for the belief, or is- it only
one of those pernicious Actions which so often attach
to perfectly innocent vegetables?
(Continued on page 2J/.)
THE HAPPY MONARCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A battered hat fends off the sun,
The saddle creaks beneath my knee;
The clinking bit and quiet hooves
Make perfect harmony.
Doubtless a king would laugh to scorn
My courtier in the dust behind;
But the staunch heart ’neath shaggy hide
I long ago divined.
No sultan in his palanquin
Is more serene than I this day ;
Spring’s in the air, a lilac haze
Curtains the hills away.
1 take the twilight for my robe,
In purple folds it settles down ;
I set upon my windblown hair
The moon’s pale light for crown.
For banner, all the bushland waves;
For carpet, eager grasses furl;
For incense, at day’s end, I watch
The camp smoke rise and curl.
My canopy is thick with stars—
God’s boundless, happy, happy sky!
AVe have the world for heritage,
My horse, my dog, and I!

“Coot": Re origin of “jumbuck" (B.
2i/11/’24). Twenty-eight years ago Mr. Meston
wrote in Tiie Bulletin: “The word ‘jumbuck’ for
sheep appears originally as ‘jumba,’ ‘jumboek,’ <dom-
boek, and ‘dumbog.’ In each case it meant the
white 1111 st preceding a shower, to which a flock of
sheep bore a strong resemblance. It seemed the
only thing the aboriginal mind could compare it to.’’
“Harvib" : .Should your goegoo gr-t staked
and any remnant of the trouble remain, just fill the
wound with grains of raw permanganate of potash.
Ihe chemical eats the wood away, and Back wood
will quickly be right again.
* * * *
“Jarrali” : The largest load of wool brought
into lalgoo (W.A.) this season was a. waggon piled
with 84 bales, weighing in all 15 tons, it came
60 miles, from Clarkson’s Meka station, and was
drawn by IT camels. The driver had to navigate
the unwieldy mass over a rocky range and down
steep banks, but got safely through, with only a
slight list to port and a few telephone wires pulled
down. On the same day another waggon with 1 4 A
tons of wool came in from another station It was
drawn by 22 donkeys.
Morob : In spite of “Rouragi” (B.
6/11/’24) I adhere to my statement that Mature
did not intend the crocodile to live always in the
immediate vicinity of water, a fact supported by the
anatomical details which “Bouragi” quotes, and
which go to show that the croc, is a land animal
first, adapted for living in water secondly. In North-
ern Queensland in the dry weather the crocs, migrate
as the creeks which they haunt dry up, and always
they make the journey directly overland, instinct
seeming to tell them the direction in which the
nearest water is, instead of following the course of
the stream to the coast and then keeping to the
latter, as one might expect them to do if they were
purely water-dwelling creatures. In New Guinea
croc, trirtks are frequently met with a mile or two
away from water, and in some districts the natives
THE STONE-AGE.
“I see you have a new stenographer.”
“Yes, my hoy—a wonder! She thinks nothing of twenty words
a day!”
are careful to avoid thick patches of grass within
a mile or so of a creek. About seven years ago
a white man was seized and killed by a croc, at a
spot on the north-western coast which was a good
two miles from the nearest river, and at the time
there was no shortage of food or water which might
have driven the reptile away. Apparently it just
happened to be there when its victim was unlucky
enough to come along.
“Kelaua” : Like “B.S.A.’s” (B. 20/11/ ? 24)
German Lutheran missionaries of Finke River (S.A.)
the Lutheran mission station at Finsch ITafen, m
mandated New Guinea, had in 1922 over 20 craves
and boxes of valuable New Guinea curios ready for
shipment to Germany; but a timely ordinance gave
the Administrator power to purchase them at a
reasonable valuation to be decided by a Board of three
officials, and they no a - repose in the museum at
ACTING UNDER INSTRUCTIONS.
NIGHT WATCHMAN : “WAo gave ’ce permission to t[?]ake away that
stuff, I do want to know?”
ERRING MINER: “ ’E's like this ere. Cap'n ’e do say to me, 'Billy.
boay, the ole mine is lookin’ very dicky, and you might he
out av work any minute, so look around, an’ if ’ae do see
anything that’ll suit ’ee, taake it.’ ”
Rabaul. The collection includes many rare specimens
fo fighting weapons, totems and implements from
now extinct hinterland tribes of the Upper Markham
River. One prized object was a set of flint rainmaking
stones used by certain old luluais; also two elon-
gated waterworn stones, much like rolling-pins, used
for abdominal massage to produce abortion, the
patient having previously drunk a decoction erf pan-
danus leaves. It also includes pottery ware, the
manufacture of which is becoming a lost, art before
the white man’s enamel bowls and kerosene-tins.
Domestic earthenware was a coastal industry confined
to villages with good clay deposits, and the natives
of Rooke and Siassi islands used to make long deep-
sea voyages to the N.G. mainland, bringing pigs and
basketware to barter for pottery.
“Larry Longun”: Toll “Nitric” (B.
fi/11/’24) that the 1501 b. cod caught in Boobora
Lagoon, off the Mclntyre River (Q.), was only a
shrimp alongside the one taken from a lagoon in
Teviot Creek, near Boonah, Southern Queensland, in
1002. This big-mouth weighed above 2001 b., and
was shot in a deep muddy hole when the creek was
almost dry. The Murray cod is found in pretty
nearly every lagoon and freshwater creek in Southern
Bananaland ; hue specimens above a dozen pounds or
so are rather rare.
* * * *
“Parama”: “(iouger’s” remarks re native
girls with “shingled” hair up at the top of Australia
(B. 13/11/’24), and the manner of the shingling,
remind me. It was up
there that I saw a buck
assisting his cobber to
“dress flash” before go-
ing to see a lady friend.
The gar r one straddled
a log beside which burnt
a fire, while the other
man barbered him with
the aid of two strips of
green bark and a fire-
stick. The hair was
first raked out—and it
needed it, too; it must
have been all of seven
inches long—and then
separated into ridges,
each ridge in turn being
held between the narrow
strips of bark while the
glowing end of the fire-
stick burnt off the super-
fluous frizzle down to the
bark edge. It was a
slow job all right; and
took up most of the
afternoon ; but there was
no doubt about the result
being striking. The
burnt ends of the hair
were of a lightish brown,
and gave the head rlie
appearance of an 'out-size
freak eoeoanut.
“Lauda”: The imported fox is acquiring
anew appeite in the N.S.W. North Coast sugar
cane districts. Up this way (Clarence River) the
pest has taken toll from the canefields this season.
He chews around the base of the stalk, and the first
wind snaps it off. Reynard no doubt came to the
canefields in the first place to get the rats which
do their share of damage to the stools; the rats,
however, do not make much headway if fool persons
will leave the carpet-snakes alone and not kill them
on sight.
* * * *
“Scoar": “Strack” (B. G/ll/’24) is
rather heroic in his method of removing leading in
a rifle barrel by melting and burning it out. This
scribe would be disinclined to trust the rifling lands
after such treatment.
A simpler way is to
wash the barrel well
out with hot water,
with thorough subse-
quent drying, anil then
to use a wire brush
well charged with some
good rifle-paste such
as “Motty.” If this
fails to produce a
bright interior, with
groo\es showing clear
and sharp, secure a few
ounces of mercury,
plug one end of the
barrel after wiping out
well, fill with the mer-
cury," and leave for
half an hour. If there
is not enough mercury
to fill the barrel, stop-
per the ends with the
(fingers and roll the
mercury back and forth
for 10 minutes or more.
Then inspect, and if
not perfectly clear and
bright, repeat the pro-
cess. Special care
should be taken with
the last few inches to-
wards the muzzle. An
old bush remedy for
leading is vinegar,
filled in and left for a
few hours, but the ex-
perience of this scribe
is that, though it re-
moves the lead for he
time, it leaves a rough surface which fills up rapidly,
and worse than ever, very soon after.
* * * *
“Tuber” : The truth of Plutarch’s saying,
‘•The richest soil, if uncultivated, produces the rank-
est weeds,” was brought home to a horticulturist
recently at Onehunga (M.L.)., Energised by Spring,
he set to work to landscape a neglected corner of
his kitchen-garden. To decapitate a luxuriant dock
was no more than a moment’s work; but to uproot
it took an hour. It went down 52 inches.
* * * *
“Lutiana” : Has any member of the Coun-
cil seen my old acquaintance Treacle at Thursday
Island lately? Treacle was.,a'native of York Island.
Some 13 years ago he and a boat’s crew were skin
diving in the North-Eakt channel,, when they killed
a turtle. It is not considered
healthy to dive in Torres Strait
waters for some little time after
blood has been spilt into them,
but Treacle chanced it. A couple
of fathoms down a large f.sh
grabbed him by the head, and a
submarine combat eventuated
which would have made a priceless
picture film. “That pfellcr pfis
plenty saucy,” Treacle told me
a few days after the event. “My
bin fightem, puttem thumb in
eye belonga him and push ’im
plenty,” Ilis efforts , were suc-
cessful, the fish let go, and a
very scared Treacle was hauled
into the boat, bleeding profusely
from wounds behind one ear and
on the neck and chest. Subse-
quent investigation at the, Thurs-
day Island Hospital revealed
several of the peg-like teeth of
the groper embedded in his thick
skull, and the position of the
wounds showed clearly that his
whole head had been seized by the
fish. Gropers, by the way, are
said by reliable Strait divers to
grow to over 10ft. long, and are
far more feared than any shark
on account of their determined
pugnacity. In later years Treacle
became a shell porter at the W.ii-
ben Company’s store on Thursday
Island, and the groper grew into
a 20ft. shark which Treacle slew
with his bare hands in 15 fathoms
of water for the benefit of wonder-
ing visitors. “Plenty badfeller
that one,” Treacle would wind up.
And then, very insinuatingly:
“Two shillen strongfeller medicine alonga shark-
bite.”
* * * *
“Nitric”: A curious example of a fruit
cross, banana and paw-paw, lias occurred at Nambour,
North Coast (Q.). The paw-paw apple forms the
central body, and three or four curved bananas are
connected with the top of the apple. The paw-paw
trees are surrounded by the banana plants, and it is
not just a chance case of cross pollination, as at
least half a dozen paw-paw trees are bearing the
hybrid. The banana bunches are unaffected, so evi-
dently the cross-pollination but not the fertilisation
is mutual.
“Videlicet”: I noticed one Sunday morn-
ing a praying-mantis on a rose stalk. It was cling-
ing to the stalk with its rear legs, and with :ts
fore limbs was clutching a bee and eating into the
captive’s head. The bee was still struggling, although
cne eye was eaten out and the brain was lacerated.
With a pair of scissors I cut the mantis in halves
at his waist-line. The severed parts fell from the
stalk, and, the grip on the bee loosening, an attempt
at escape was nearly successful. The half-mantis,
however, gathered it again to the remnants of his
bosom, and I believe would have attempted to resume
the meal had 1 not placed my foot on them and
so ended the torture. The hind part of the mantis
fell upon a lily and was forgotten. On the following
Wednesday I noticed it, and on touching it with my
finger was astonished to see it move. There was
r.o doubt about the movement; it was repeated every
time I touched the insect. It surprised me that any
animal should be sensitive and apparently alive
three days after its head had been severed. (I can
subpoena several witnesses, if necessary.)
* * * *
“Macdee”: The other day, hearing some
■‘cheeping” in a shed in the back yard, I investigated,
and found it came from the innards of an old
football-cover lying on a shelf. The ball had had the
bladder removed, and the rent in the cover was
gaping open. A pair of sparrows had furnished the
inside with grass and feathers, and at present are
rearing a hefty brood in their self-contained flat—
or, rather, oval.
“Homfrey Beale”: Many birds return to
the same tree for several nesting seasons in suc-
cession, but the most persistent in this respect I’ve
met are a brace of peewits, which are now occupying
for the eleventh season a hybrid box-tree near me.
The nests of the last 10 years are all on the same
limb, about two inches of space between each, and
the eleventh (for some reason they are a bit late
this season) is nearing completion the usual distance
from the tenth. The runner-up honors, as far as
my experience goes, belongs to a pair of magpies'
which built for nine years in succession (a different
nest each year) in a big coolabah on Euroka station
(\valgett, N.'S.W.) in the days when Wolseley was
evolving his sheep-shearing machine there. This
pair of birds became so tame that they used to come
regularly to the station and squawk arrogantly till
the c-ook or his locum threw them raw meat, which
they would carry off to the youngsters. During the
ninth nesting season the tree happened to be in the
path of lightning, and that was the finish.
* # * *
“Toby 0.”: No doubt many people would
tilt their noses if they dropped in for lunch at a
wayside camp and were offered a dish of steaming-
hot stewed ’possum. I knew one of those epicurean
snobs, but last year’s big drought in the south-west
of Queensland cured him and his family of their
high notions. Meat was very scarce, almost unpro
curable. Our neighbor’s wife told my missus that
her old man had walked his boots off trying to get a
wallaby or a young kangaroo for Sunday’s dinner.
AFFECTED BY IT, TOO.
CHEERFUL GENT.: “Ah, my friend, does not this holy
season fill one with beautiful, unspoken, romantic
thoughts?”
THE OTHER : “Yus, mister; I must say as ’ow I do feel
like a coupler beers meself.”
My missus was unsympathetic and told the complain-
ing one to try ’possum. I was choking a few at the
time, so the missus supplied a recipe and promised
to save a young buck from Saturday-night’s catch.
Ihev sent their kid down for the ’possum on Sunday
morning. We gave them two. Evidently the flavor
pleased them, for that kid called at our camp for
a ’possum every morning for seven weeks. Then the
drought broke,
* * ♦ *
“Spenner”: An old-timer tells me that
free, straight-grained posts will easily outlast the
tough cross-grained ones. Can any Abo. fencers verify
this?
DIDJERIDOO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Didjeridoo—didjeridoo!
A blackfellow blows through a length of bamboo
To the regular beat of an iromvood stick,
Click-click, click-click-click ;
And the throb of his breath is the ghost of a drum
" *th a madness of apathy muffling its thrum.
The sun, a red gasp, sank down in its throes,
And the night waits for wind as a coward for blows;
And there s little to learn and nothing to do
But hark in the dark to the didjeridoo.
Didjeridoo— didjeridoo!
A nursery-rhyme and a history too.
Black faces lean over a flickering fire;
A nasal chant rises, drops low, rises higher,
Then wearily fades to an echo of wind
Over withering grasses that footsteps have thinned
Through nomadic ages, space without scope
Unscarred by regret and unharassed by hope:
l or primitive aeons are distanced into
A groan to the bone by the didjeridoo.
Didjeridoo—didjeridoo!
Uven the pastorals, lyric with dew,
Piped in Arcadian meadows, so green
And so golden and glad and so mythically clean,
Vie not so remote as this primeval sound
lhat broods like a beast nuzzling close to the
ground
loi the spoor of its kind or an answering wail,
ibis piper sits playing and knows all things fail.
The days are so many, the years are so few,
Says the thud, as of mud, in the didjeridoo.’

THE RED PAGE’S OFFSIDER.
Art and Bread and Butter
Are the paint-pots seriously affected by
intimate association with the flesh-pots? Such
a question, of course, can be debated till
further orders and still be left gaping open
like a laugh frozen in mid-action. For Art
is an unknown quantity, and, like the algo
braic x, cannot be weighed, tested, probed,
emulsified, carbonated or broken down into
elements. It is impossible to gauge whether
it shrinks or expands under the application
of heat; there is no logical formula to deter-
mine where it is likely to be found.
The root of this question about bread and
butter, of course, lies in the fact that an
artist’s soul is unavoidably incorporated in
a body, and that that body requires food,
drink, clothing and lots of other clutter. An
artist must live, and it is usually agreed
that he should live by his art. But is it
best that he should live by his art?
In a materialistic age conspicuously noted
for its commercialism and its comfort, demo-
cracy has taught the populace that warmth,
nourishment and a generous allowance of
luxury is the heritage of every free citizen.
A martyr’s crown or a starving genius is
as out of date as a dinosaur; and the pic-
turesque business of starving for the sake
of an idea has become a hundred per cent,
more complex and difficult since Art has
become respectable. With remarkably few
exceptions, artists of striking originality who
have founded the big, valuable milestones
in the history of the development of Art
have been unappreciated and denounced dur-
ing their lifetime. A new idea, when first-
offered to the world, is rather like a wire-
less message pitched in a new key for which
there are at the moment no receivers to cor-
respond. It needs some high courage on the
part of the operator to persist in sending out
that message. Meanwhile the body clamors
for bread and butter, and since garrets and
black bread are out of fashion, pot-boiling
seems to be the only way out. And in the
boiling of that pot the ideal evaporates or
is blunted and diminished until it becomes
unrecognisable. If the pot-boilers sell well
and the demand for them increases, more
slickness is developed and they become a
habit.
The other alternative for the artist pos-
sessed of a high ideal is to provide himself
with life’s necessities by the pursuit of some
trade or business, devoting all his spare time
to his art, and remaining quite indifferent
and independent of its saleability. In theory
this seems to be the nobler course. Un-
tainted by thoughts of its market value and
the temptation to modify liis original style
to suit popular taste, surely the artist can
express his ideals stark and fresh as his
imagination conceives them; while as a
butcher, a plumber, a draper or a company
promoter he secures enough bread and butter
to keep his soul securely connected with his
body ! But upon actual evidence this scheme
is not found successful. Here in Australia
most artists who are a living in
trade or business and are devoting only their
spare time to Art, are distinctly lacking in
inspiration or even moderately acceptable
technique. All our artists who are doing
anything worth while are supporting them-
selves by their art.
But would not these do still better and
be more ready to persist in expressing new
ideas regardless of public derision if they
were freed of the burden of money-getting?
Here is an opportunity for experiment. It
only requires a public-spirited philanthropist
or so to stop forward and found a scholar-
ship, and the problem might be put to the
test. J. F. Archibald’s friends know that
he had this in his mind, and he made avail-
able a sum of money sufficient to furnish a
prize of three or four hundred a year; un-
fortunately his real intentions do not seem
to have been expressed, and when he sought
to express them it was too late. Like the
thesis of a candidate for a University degree,
the new point of view put forward by an
artist candidate for the scholarships here
suggested could be judged on its merits,
and under the perfect system the scholarship
or pension covering a certain number of
years would he awarded accordingly. If
such an artist during the given time should
fail entirely to deliver his glowing message
to the world, then he could go back to the
designing of jam-labels or the painting of
plaques. The outstanding difficulty would
be to find a board or committee fitted to
decide wdiether the chosen exponent of a
novel ideal was a freak or a genius.
IIETTIE KNIGHT.
Alfred Selwyn, Pioneer Geologist
Selwyn’s labors in the solitude of the
forest, the seclusion of the study and the
hurly-burly of the diggings are preserved
in dingy geological reports, mostly out of
print and difficult of access. The kernel has
been extracted and embodied in more recent
publications, and Selwyn’s name is now only
seen on those masterpieces of cartography
that cannot be superseded. Simple state-
ments of fact, couched in scientific language
and bereft of all romance, do not appeal to
the popular imagination. He came to Vic-
toria when the gold fever was still strong,
he was in daily contact with it; more is the
pity that he did not leave a popular account
of his movements. Amidst such boisterous
surroundings the experiences and impressions
of an indefatigable spirit quietly seeking to
add to the sum of scientific knowledge must
have afforded material for an absorbing
narrative. But if Selwyn ever felt the urge
he deliberately suppressed it.
Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn, the son of
Canon Selwyn, of Gloucester Cathedral, was
born at Kilmington, Somerset, on July 28,
1824. Although December, 1852, marks the
beginning of his career in Australia, the pre-
ceding seven years were full of meaning to
Australian geology. In 1845 he was attached
to the Geological Survey of Britain, and be-
came saturated with the high ideals and
genius of Lyell, Murchison, De la Beche and
the galaxy of talent directly or indirectly
associated with that survey. The British
ideal has always been uppermost in the high
standard of work set by Australian staffs, due
in no small degree to Selwyn’s early train-
ing. Latrobe, desiring the services of a
mineral surveyor, asked the Colonial Office
to appoint “a competent agent of this class.”
Selwyn came to Victoria towards the end of
1852. He immediately set out to examine
the principal goldfields and become acquainted
with local geological structure. In April,
1853, lie started a geological survey of the
Castlemaine area. This was the beginning of
that series of quarter-sheets and reports on
various parts of the State, produced by liis
self-trained staff and himself, that are still
considered the highest expression of geologi-
cal work. I have the Castlemaine sheet be-
fore me; it would be difficult to conceive of
more detailed and accurate mapping. Creeks,
gullies, hills, roads, reef outcrops, geological
boundaries and a host of other details are
clearly shown. There is no confusion, no
crowding; the draughtsmanship is perfect.
It would be an arduous task to follow
Selwyn’s widespread activities during the
succeeding years. He went everywhere,
reported on all kinds of mineral and metal
occurrences, prepared plans, sections and
reports of the more important areas, and
dealt with numberless problems arising out
of geological structure. Practical as he was,
he always kept the scientific side well to the
fore. Possibly this policy had something
to do with the suspension of the survey in
18G9, under the plea of economy. His con-
temporaries were notoriously ignorant of the
application of science to practice. Bnt
Selwyn’s worth was justly appraised outside
Australia. About this time Sir William
Logan retired from the directorship of the
Canadian Geological Survey and Selwyn
was at once appointed, lie occupied the
position with zeal and ability until 1894.
Honors were heaped upon him. He was
elected a Fellow of the Geological Society,
a Fellow of the Royal Society, was awarded
the Murchison Medal and had the LL.D.
degree conferred upon him. He died in 1902.
To appreciate Selwyn’s achievements one
has to go back to the period of his Austra-
lian activities. Geological research was
largely carried on by amateurs, and looked
upon as an entertaining hobby by the middle
and upper classes. Few in Victoria knew
anything about it, and fewer still its appli-
cation to practical problems. So limited,
indeed, was this knowledge of the subject
that Selwyn had to bring together and train
a staff. No greater compliment can be paid
to him than to review the positions attained
by his trainees. Daintree was appointed
Government Geologist of Northern Queens-
land, Aplin was appointed to a similar posi-
tion in respect to Southern Queensland;
Ulrich became Professor of Mining and
Metallurgy at Otago, Wilkinson Geological
Surveyor of N. S. Wales; Murray became
Government Geologist of Victoria, and Brown
of South Australia. Etheridge was appointed
palaeontologist to the Geological Survey of
N. S. Wales and Curator of the Australian
Museum.
According to E. J. Dunn, who was a
member of his staff, Selwyn was quick of
temper, but just though strict with his men.
It is noteworthy, in regard to his fairness,
that every member of the staff who executed
a quarter-sheet has his name inscribed upon
it.

South Sea Writers
For more than half a century writers of
South Sea romances have been trying to im-
prison the magic of golden beaches, of cry-
stal pools, of wondrous maidens with laugh-
ing eyes, of subtle scents and beautiful
flowers, of the joy of life lived as in a
dream. There is the other side to the pic-
ture, of course, but few have let their pens
dwell on it; perhaps because they did not
see it, perhaps because they have not had
the courage to write about it. I do not know.
Herman Melville was the pioneer. He
went to sea early on a merchantman, and
later on a whaler ; deserted, and was captured
by the natives of the Marquesas group. In
“Typee” he has told the story of his life
while in the hands of the natives, who,
although cannibalistic, seemed to have no
desire to reduce him to a stew. Again in
“Omoo” he painted a convincing picture of
his wanderings among the Sandwich and
Society islands. After him came Pierre
Loti, painter of wonderful word-pictures,
who died only a few months ago. Loti was
a French naval officer, and paid visits to
Tahiti —Tahiti where you actually do find
dusky, languorous maidens and handsome
men and warm nights aglow with a mystic
beauty; where you actually do find golden
beaches and crystal pools and luscious fruits.
The Frenchman put it all into “The Mar-
riage of Loti” —and, for good measure, his
love for one dark beauty. After Loti, Louis
Becke. Born in Australia, at the age of
14 he went to sea. Before he began to turn
his adventures into stories he lived a crowded
life, travelling all over the islands as a
trader, and then he wove his experiences into
many fine tales of the sea and of the islands.
A couple of his novels were written in col-
laboration with Walter Jeffery, who was,
until his death a few years ago, managing
editor of Sydney Evening News. Becke’s
works have just been issued in a new edition.
But of all the writers wdio have gone to
the South Seas Robert Louis Stevenson is
the most interesting, because, apart from his
personal charm and the beauty of his writ-
ing. there wrns the loving and cheerful heart
that beat beneath the poor weak chest, and
the wmnderful spirit that persisted to the
end in seeing only the sunlight of life and
not the dark shadows that clung to him all
the time he was in Samoa. In “The. Island
Nights’ Entertainment” and in the many
delightful letters written to friends from
Apia he has given intimate pictures of island
life that show he saw all the gold and
little of the dross. After R.L.S. had been
buried on the top of Mount Vaeae, there was
a lull in the pilgrimage to the South Seas.
Then came Frederick O’Brien, who re-dis-
covered the romantic splendor of the Tahiti
that had charmed Loti. O’Brien, an Irish-
American journalist, for some time wandered
aimlessly around the islands. Coming to
Tahiti, he met Rupert Brooke, who himself
has embodied in several poems of rare beauty
the wonder and the magic of the island’s life.
“Tiare Tahiti” is a fine thing, and there are
many who know the witchery of his
“Waikiki.” The pair spent many happy,
carefree days together, swimming in the
pools and seeing the wonders of Tahitian
life. Joyous days! You can see Brooke,
a slim, eager youth, and O’Brien, cool and
calm, diving into the translucent waters,
drinking in the perfumes “like a breath
from vine and sea,” lying on the moonlit
beaches under the palm-trees listening to
the ukulele that “thrills and cries.” O'Brien
has told of all this enchantment in “White
Shadows of the Southern Seas.” There were
some who tried to prove that the glories he
had found were merely the illusions of a
poetic mind ; but, at any rate, his books are
delightful things, and if you want to glimpse
the isles in all their golden garments his
books will yield the pictures.
Jack London had some stirring adven-
tures around the South Seas during those
heart-breaking days when he tried to force
himself to write. But the interest of .Tack
London’s association with the islands lies
more in the facts of his life—his strivings,
sorrows and adventures —than in the tales
he has written about them. Came then
Somerset Maugham; but he is gifted with
too deep a sense of the bitterness of things
to see much of the glory of the isles. He
saw rather the ingloriousness—the subtle
spell that breaks men’s spirits and makes of
them physical and moral wrecks. <>f the same
type, up to a certain point, is A. Saffroni-
Middleton. With a fiddle and a personality
lie roamed about, finding romance in every
odd corner that his aimless footsteps led him
to. He had several rather wonderful adven-
tures with beautiful island maidens, especi-
ally with Fai-Fai, a lovely girl who shared
thrilling episodes with the dreaming wan-
derer. Once she started to elope with him,
hut after exciting adventures, described
vividly in “South Sea Foam,” an inquisitive
father put an end to the idea. Saffroni-
Middleton had the eyes to see the romance
and glamor of the islands, and in his incom-
parable books he has mirrored this charm
with fine feeling and a power of colorful
description unrivalled in island literature.
I shall never forget the delight with which
I read “Wine Dark Seas and Tropic Skies,”
“South Sea Foam,” “A Vagabond’s Odyssey.”
And his novels are as captivating as liis
other books. He actually found the romance
that most of us only succeed in dreaming
of. To this group I add John Russell,
formerly a reporter on the New York Sun,
who has told some wonderful tales of the
South Seas —tales that showed such strength
and insight that he was hailed by impetuous
American critics as the American Kipling,
The best of them have been gathered into
“Where the Pavement Ends.”
Only two women are conspicuous among
the few of their sex who have gone to these
seas for their color—Beatrice Grimshaw,
who still pours out her tales from her New
Guinea islet; and G. B. Lancaster, whose
promise was never quite fulfilled.
ROY CHASE.
The Humor of the ’Forties
In the days of the Great War there drifted
out of Rouen to a base hospital a time-worn
volume in a dilapidated cover. It circulated
among the Tommies, cot-bound but on the
way to convalescence, and excited not an
atom of interest. Its rough woodcuts had
no humor for them, and its letterpress con-
veyed little meaning. Thrown from hand
to hand, it became mere litter predestined
to the fire. An Australian in the British
Army, one of the “Old Oontemptibles,”
picked it up one day and found a prize.
The volume contained copies of London
Punch from Number 1, issued on July 17,
1841, to No. 145, issued on April G,
1544. First numbers of Punch are not alto-
gether rare —we have one in our Public
Library in Sydney—but are sufficiently scarce
to make their possession treasured.
Up to the close of 1843 Punch tried three
separate designs for its front cover, and then
settled down to what in its general features,
though there have been minor changes, is the
familiar page of to-day. The design on the
first number is that of a Punch and Judy
show surrounded by a motley group of spec-
tators, all ages, all classes, and bears the
title “Punch, or the London Charivari.”
The paper was introduced to the public in
words which illustrate the literary style of
the period:—
As we hope, gentle public, to pass many happy
hours in your society, we think it right that you
should know something of our character and inten-
tions. Our title, at a first glance, may have misled
you into a belief that we have no other intention than
the amusement of a thoughtless crowd and the
collection of pence. We have a higher object. Few
of the admirers of our prototype, merry Master Punch,
have looked upon his vagaries but as the practical
outpouring of a rude and boisterous mirth. We have
considered him as a teacher of no mean pretensions,
and have, therefore, adopted him as the sponsor for
our weekly sheet of pleasant instruction.
The introductory flourish concludes: “Our
pages will be interspersed with trifles that
have no other object than the moment’s
approbation—an end which will never be
sought for at the expense of others, beyond
the evanescent smile of a harmless satire.”
A rather smug sort of self-approbation, per-
haps ; but it can be truly said that from 1841
to date Punch has been true to its principle
of laughter without wounds. The happy
poise between humor and the satire that
seeks to hurt has been maintained with
wonderful success. Hence it is that, if there
have been days in a long career when its
wit has needed seeking, it has never failed
to hold our affection. In its dullest days it
has at least been “sporting.”
It is interesting to learn from the pages
of this first number that the “star” system
in theatrical management was even then a
grievance. Punch attributes the decline of
the drama to this cause, and by it the drama-
tist “drawn from the path of fame degen-
erates into a literary drudge.” The epigram
in verse was a feature of the paper, and the
following is a fair example of that sort of
poetic wit:—
One mom two friends before the Newgate drop
To see a culprit throttled chanced to stop:
“Alas!” cried one as round in air he spun,
“That miserable wretch’s race is run.”
“True,” said the other drily, “to his cost
The race is run—but, by a neck ’tis lost.”
Lest the casual reader should miss the point
the pregnant words were italicised. An old
friend well known to the pioneers of our
country, though seemingly new pills and
potions have driven him out of the market,
is referred to in this paragraph . . j

ile probation at Eaton has done him g •

‘Yes, Madam,’ was the repiy; he seems to
have gained by Eaton what his fat ‘

is verv odd.’ said Sergeant Channel to II s-
siger, ‘that Tindnl should have decided
against me on that point of law which, to
me, seems as plain as A B C. I( Jh
Thessiger; ‘but of what use is it that it sh
have been A B C to you if the Judge was
determined to be I) E F to it. a
even in those days a surplus in the revenue
was something for exclamation marks was
testified in the following: “Consequent upon
the discovery having been made last week
that there would be a surplus in the quar-
ter's revenue, the Chancellor of the Kx-
chequer. with the greatest promptitude, gave
orders that all the clerks in the J l'Ofi-
sury should immediately undergo a strict
mathematical examination, in order to test
their capabilities of managing the same,
such a thing as ‘loose cash’ not having been
heard of in that neighborhood for years
past.” . , ,
On the whole, one is not astonished, com-
paring what we call for now with what the
public got then in the way of , humorous
entertainment, that the Tommies at the
French base hospital passed the book on
promptly, and that it finally became derelict.
Perhaps SO years hence our notion of what
constitutes wit and humor may appear as
quaint to our grandchildren as what satis-
fied the British public in 1841 appears to
us to-day.

Why Collect Books?
Once again, I loathe books.
For the three greatest works in literature
I still find some use; but for the rest I have
no liking. I am no book-lover. Books <‘is
books do not interest me, except for their
contents. I gaze with a vague wonder at
the large class of the community which col-
lects books, instead of merely borrowing
them from a library and forgetting to re-
turn them. And to me the most amazing
feature in this groat civilisation of ours is
the number of its second-hand bookshops.
Why should people buy old books when
they can buy modern editions? Old books
for new! But why? I prefer the latest
lawn-mower to the oldest; I like new-laid
eggs and fresh-made tea. I have, even in
my middle-age, no respect for old age—not
even for my approaching own. Yet there
are large classes of people who seek for early
editions and mediaeval copies of works that
are to be had in excellent cheap productions.
The book collector seems to me as absurd as
the infant who collects used tram-tickets.
A book is to be read and absorbed and
thrown away. You've got Avhat you wanted
out of it. To me he is a pathetic figure,
the haunter of second-hand bookshops, look-
ing for treasures among the discarded rub-
bish of the centuries. He loves books as
books; he handles a dead thing, that has been
kept in the cold storage of rubbish for a
century, as reverently as he lays out a
corpse. He fondles the fading print with
a fatuous joy. To him a first edition is a
treasure, simply because it is a first edition.
He dreams of the adventures of that stodgy
pamphlet picked up out of the sixpenny
basket; he imagines romance in this chance
survival, and carries it proudly home to gloat
upon it. He might as well gloat over a de-
composed crayfish for all the good it does
him. And how eagerly lie pays 15 shillings
for a book that was published for five ! He
has reveries of discovering masterpieces,
though the only known case is that of Fitz-
gerald’s “Omar.” All the books that are
worth while have survived ; the rest are better
dead.
It is not fair to living authors: they have
enough competition to meet in the vast accu-
mulation of books published before they
were born. Keats has been responsible for
the literary murder of a score of modern
Iveatses. He got there first; he said all the
things that the modern poets would have
said and can’t say now for fear of being
echoes, though the same phrase could quite
as easily come to a boy among us to-day as
it came to Keats. The dead hand in litera-
ture has turned many a modern embryo poet
into a solicitor. Everything has already
been said by myself and others.
The only book-collectors for whom I have
any respect are those who collect for profit.
They buy up rare books in the hope of a
rise in price. First folios have realised re-
markable prices; and a scrap of paper with
a poem on it in manuscript, signed by some-
body sufficiently dead, is eagerly sought for.
Not for the poem, which can be had in col-
lected editions, but for the mere scratches
of the poet’s pen. These business-men recog-
nise that the rarer a thing is in literature
the more valuable it becomes; the quality
does not matter. Such book-collectors deal
in rare books as jewellers deal in rare pearls;
and they are to be commended on their en-
terprise.
As for the unprinted poem, it has not
been printed because it was not worth
it. And a poem by a known man must be
bad indeed to reach that point. Every poet
has disgracefully over-printed himself; and
every collected edition is three-quarters punk.
These poetical gardens need periodically
weeding; instead, the tendency is to contri-
bute to them more weeds.
Another curious variety of book-lover de-
lights in uncut edges. Why this habit has
survived amazes me. There are machines
expressly made for trimming the untidy edges
of books, yet there are publishers, and read-
ers, who have a fatuous affection for uncut
and irregular pages. These pages must be
cut if the book is to be read ; and usually
they are torn apart with a rude finger or
a haphazard hairpin, ruining both book and
temper. To the guillotine with the lot of
them!
Incidentally, I find I have mentioned the
three greatest works in literature. They
are, of course, Roget’s “Thesaurus,” “The
Concise Oxford Dictionary” and the latest
“Book of Quotations.” In th.ese three im-
mortal works are to be found the whole body
of our literature.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Panchaz” : After all, wool has still a long
way to go before one record over a century
old will be approached. The first lot of fleece
from Australia sold in London in 1821. in-
cluded a bale of Macarthur’s which realised
124 d. per lb.
* * * *
“Sturt” : Adelaide Electric Co. announces
that its East-terrace power-house will be
closed by next March, the whole of the power
being supplied, for the 760 square miles
which the co. now lights, from one great sta-
tion at Osborne, on the Port River. This will
have the advantage of removing almost the
only smoking chimney-stack left in the city.
“Deta” : Another injustice to Australia!
This time it is in United Empire, the jour-
nal of the Royal Colonial Institute, which
ought to know better. It alleges that Mau-
ritius, with an output averaging 200,000 tons
for the last five years, is the largest sugar-
producing unit in the Empire, after British
India. Australia has been doing better than
that for years, and this season’s crop runs to
over 400,000 tons. Queensland alone beats
Mauritius easily.
* * * *
“Moe” : In the old days of German New
Guinea the company which originally con-
trolled the territory issued its own currency
in the form of nickel coins differing from the
mark in that they bore on one side a bird-of-
paradise and the company’s name. Many of
them remained in circulation for years after
the German Government took over the
administration, but during the Australian
military occupation most of them dis-
appeared. Since then collectors have devel-
oped a taste for them: not long ago a friend
of mine sold four of them for £5 in Sydney,
and .at a recent sale in London a single coin
brought £4 10s.
* * * *
“Light Horse”: A cable says that Army
meat-contracts are likely to. favor M.L. and
Australia, the modern Thomas Atkins pre-
ferring their products to those of the Argen-
tine. This is easy to believe. Both in the
Big Fuss and the Boer War of a generation
ago Australian tinned meats and jams led
all the rest in Army estimation. . There was
no Argentine tinned stuff in S’Africa, but
the Australian meat was up against the pro-
ducts of the big Chicago firms and did not
suffer. In the Big Show one Argentine brand
at least was a byword for beastliness. The
English jam, too, was always passed over
for Australian if possible; one English brand
of apricot earned a quite unprintable name
on the Peninsula.
* * * *
“Fitz” : The early-closing movement scored
its first success in Sydney 80 years ago—
when 7 p.m. was considered early. On
October 29, 1544, a meeting of drapers and
their assistants was held at the School of
Arts, at which it was announced that 25
proprietors had signed the following agree-
ment : “We, the undersigned, hereby agree, in
accordance with the prayer of the memorial
addressed to us by the assistant drapers, to
close our respective houses of business at 7
o’clock in the summer months, commencing
on the first, day of March, 4845.” Out of
36 drapery establishments, the total number
in Sydney in October, 1844, only two pro-
prietors absolutely refused to sign or observe
the agreement.
* * *• *•
“0.G.C.” : Probably the only occasion dur-
ing the Big War when gambling was sanc-
tioned by the British military authorities
was in Cairo. At a carnival held on behalf
of various European societies roulette-tables
were installed in Esbekiah gardens. Each
night the tables ivere besieged by cosmopoli-
tan crowds. The tables’ earnings were swept
into large wooden boxes, and after a few hours’
play these would be bulging with piastres.
The miniature Monte Carlo ended abruptly
one night with the sudden cessation of the
electric lights. In the darkness and confu-
sion some opportunist got clear away with
one of the treasure-chests. Probably he was
the only patron of the tables who was able
to show a profit over the carnival.

“Sixenate”: The world is becoming a
cramped place for the man who formerly took
the wings of the morning to cheat his credi-
tors. Victoria is the latest State to sign a
reciprocity agreement with Britain for the
enforcement of the legal judgments of one
country in the other. It doesn’t go as far as
the agreement between Britain and N. S.
Wales,, which sweeps in even maintenance
orders; but practically every other form of
debt is covered, and the maintenance liability
may yet be included. An attempt to estab-
lish reciprocal agreements in this connection
between all the countries of the English-
speaking world has been made during the
last few years; but the United States Con-
gress turned the scheme down, though the
Government had favored it.

“X2X”: One method of liquor reform
which nobody advocates in Australia —per-
haps because of its simplicity—-would be to
reduce the alcoholic content of the different
drinks; under the present excise regulations
our malted and spirituous beverages are
among the strongest in the world. Beer,
for instance, contains 11 or 12 per cent, of
alcohol, as against half of this amount in
England, and only 2 or 3 per cent, in France;
even in Germany malt liquors seldom have
more than sor 6 per cent.. Spirits are pro-
portionately strong. Australian-made whisky
generally containing from 50 to 60 per cent,
alcohol, while in Britain it has only 45 per
cent. Locally-made wines, after fermenta-
tion, are frequently fortified to 17 per cent,
and more with grape spirit, whereas the
strength of many of the light Continental
wines is but 4 or 5 per cent.

“Frank L.”: Mention of the first consign-
ment of salt beef that left Sydney in 1840
reminds me of the part the old Royal Hotel
played in launching the beef-export trade.
COMPENSATION.
THE FAIR TRAVELLER: “Going to a new country a girl never
knows what's before her.”
THE DARK OFFICER : “No doubt; but she usually becomes satisfied
to know what's beside her.”
In the coffee-room of that rambling old build-
ing in George-street, later used as a Soldiers’
Club, a public meeting was held in 1848 to
consider proposals “for the export of salt
beef and Australian horses.” Among the
committee elected were such well-known citi-
zens of the period as James Jamieson, J.
Blaxland (brother of tlie explorer), J. Buck-
land, J. B. Montefiore, H. Donnison, R.
Brooks, John Dickson, Daniel Cooper, Samuel
Terry, Edward Wollstonecraft and W. Lith-
gow. Later it was announced that “despite
a disastrous drought of three years’ dura-
tion the colony was still able to export
meat cheaper than any other country in
the world.” Half a century was to pass
before the Argentine arrived as a competitor.

“Loco”: “Clerk” (B. 20/11/’24) is lucky
if he gets paid for a day off from his job
on the Vic. railways, whether his indisposi-
tion happens to coincide with a cricket match
or not. The mere daily-paid running-branch
staff are docked a quarter of an hour if they
are that much short, even though it be
through no fault of their own. Also, “Clerk”
is “Mr.” five minutes after he enters the
service; we remain Jack, Bill or Tom to the
end of our lives, save for the very rare
exceptions who progress to the “salaried
staff.” Further, “Clerk” gets a first-class
pass when on annual leave the first year of
service. Many daily-paid men are 20 or 30
years reaching that altitude, and some never
reach it. Surely the men who earn the
railway revenue, day and night, in all weath-
ers, deserve at least as good treatment as
the clerical staff.

“Harold Hardupp”: In Melbourne, where
the measured whisky has not come into
vogue—the nip is 10d., anyway—it is con-
sidered the fair thing to fill the glass “up
to the pretty.” An enterprising bagman
recently drew the attention of the trade to
a sample glass which showed how a quarter
of an inch of good intoxicant could be saved.
Some Bonifaces, satisfied with their profits,
declined to countenance this fraud; others
were not so squeamish. They are sorry
now. The traveller, who demanded cash on
delivery for his wares, had bought a job lot
of glasses at a very low figure because they
were irregular in design; and the “pretties”
were actually higher in many' of the glasses
than in the ordinary drinking vessel. The
upshot is that a few men are getting less
whisky than they think they are paying for,
some publicans are lieaping curses on a
traveller's bead, and here and there drinkers
are wondering why those last five nips had
more effect than they should.

Will Lawson identifies a historic craft:
A picture of the Golden Age, the first steamer to
cross the Pacific, hangs in the Navigation gallery of
the Golden Gate Park Museum, San Francisco. But
it is denied its rightful honor ; a photo of the Colo-
rado, right alongside, carries the legend: “The first
steamer to cross the Pacific ; sailed from San Fran-
cisco Jan. 1, 1867.” In my first search I missed
the Golden Age, because her picture bore no name.
But in a letter, inserted in the frame, the name is
mentioned, and one may further learn that this pic-
ture, painted on wood, was given to the priests of the
shrine of a Japanese sea-god, called Ivotohira, by two
Japanese sailors. For 37 years it was an object of
veneration to seafaring worshippers; it was finally
secured, after a lot of trouble, by an American cap-
tain and sent to the museum. On close examina-
tion the word “Golden” and an “E” can be seen
on the wood. Captain Connor, who had the old
ship during a period of her interesting career,
testified to the writer of the letter that the
picture was a “splendid likeness of the good old ship. ’
But no one here seems to have known that this wan
the first trans-Paciflc steamer, and until further proof
is given the Colorado will continue to claim the
honor, though the Panama steamers Kiakoura, Rua-
hine, Mataura and Rakaia crossed and recrossed the
Pacific many times before the Colorado pushed ofT
from East-street, San Francisco. The Golden Age
sailed from Sydney on May 11, 1854.

“C.B. J.”: The patience of the people en-
gaged in sea transport is amazing. Every time
a boat ties up in Australia a swarm ot
wharf-lumpers is necessary to trundle the
cargo around on primitive barrows; in other
words, the work is done coolie-fashion, but
tlie pay is White Australian. The method
represents the line of least resistance, and
the expense is passed on to the public. In
any big business, especially relating to trans-
port, the public has the strongest moral_ right
to service. Harbor
Trusts and ship-
pi n g companies
equally are under
obligations to pro-
vide facilities to
that end. Not-
withstanding that
the Pyramids may
have been built in
that manner, the
ancient habit of
doing a job by
sheer weight of
men is, in Austra-
lia at least, stupid-
ity ; and so long as
the Harbor Trusts
and shipping cos.
fail to perceive
this, so long will
the public suffer
disservice and Aus-
tralian industries
which depend upon
inter-State trans-
port feel the smoth-
ering weight of
high freights, stack-
ing charges and all
the etceteras. The
penalty for being a
public danger is
elimination, and at
least 80 per cent,
of the strike-crazed
wharf-lumpers can
be released for pro-
ductive work by
the installation of
cargo-handling ma-
chinery on the
wharves. A con-
veyor line running
along a wharf,
with transfer
branches at inter-
vals to the sheds,
supplemented by
portable stacking
conveyors, and if necessary, feeders from
tlie ships’ holds, will handle cargo with less
damage and expense and more expedition
than any number of wharf-lumpers. Even
if the expense were the same, the conveyors
would be a wise precaution; for while one
has a sporting chance of coping with a few
militant bees, it is different when a whole
swarm continually aims to settle in one’s
whiskers.

“T.0.T.”: Early maps of North Sydney
show that large grants of land had been
made there to a few lucky people. Robert
Ryan had 120 acres, starting from Mil-
son’s Point; adjoining him came James Mil-
son, sen., with 50 acres; Billy Blue had SO
acres, starting from the point named after
him ; Thomas Walker, 39 acres; next to this
last was the Wollstonecraft —now Berry—•
grant, of 524 acres. Between Milson and
Walker was a strip of land now bounded by
McLaren, Walker, Lavender and Miller
streets; in 1839 this was surveyed as the
town of St. Leonards, and on May 14, 1840,
the first sale was held, the upset price being
£lO per half-acre. Thomas Walker gave
£lOB for the first lot put up ; the half-acre
on which is now Christ Church went to
Stuart Alexander Donaldson for £208; W. C.
Wentworth paid £lO4 for the half-acre at
the corner of Lavender-street and Miller-
street ; and other well-known buyers were
Archibald Mossman, Oswald Bloxsome, James
Milson, jun., and Judge Burton.

“Gouger” : The warden in the old Palmer
(Q.) days had a strenuous time rounding up
the elusive Chinese diggers for their miners’
rights. Officialdom soon tired of the monot-
onous “Whaffor,” and one night a mob of
contumacious pagans found themselves hand-
cuffed to a chain stretched among the trees
surrounding the lock-up. John’s swag was
collared, and no more notice was taken of
him until the ten bob for the right was
forthcoming, which happened very quickly.
At Maytown and Byrestown 150 Chows came
to understand whaffor in a single night. On
the Byrestown portion of the Palmer alone
£4OOO was obtained from Ah Sin in 12
months for his right to disturb Australian
soil. As the Palmer was nearly a hundred
miles in length, the number of yellow aliens
can be guessed at. An enterprising Cau-
casian, scenting easy money, slipped into a
police uniform and waited on the main road
for the incoming mobs of Chow diggers, -
lecting ten bob in exchange for every I
of paper purporting to be a miners r
He made a great haul, but his luck was
right out: a genuine constable nabbed inn
as he was stepping on the Cooktown boat tor
Brisbane.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: The Colombo natives, whose
diving feats have impressed ocean travellers
for generations, discovered in 1919 that tney
had no monopoly of the game. v\ hen tlie
Somali dropped in on its first trip atwr
the Armistice with unfit men for Australia,
there was no shore-leave, and throwing coins
overboard for the niggers to retrieve was tlie
only recreation for those on board. 1 re-
sently some impecunious Diggers became nu-
tated at seeing the darkies making such
easy money, and went overboard to take a
hand. Perhaps it was colored brother s
wholesome fear of a collision with a superioi
race that caused him to keep well out oi
the white divers’ way; at any rate, one
Caucasian claimed to be 16 bob to the good
over his exhibition —“and a good swim into
the bargain.”
* * * *
“Chemiste”: “Cartot” is quite wrong
when he includes therapeutics among the sub-
jects in which the chemist is given no in-
struction. A chemist, in order to have an
intimate knowledge of the drugs lie dispenses,
is required also to know their uses. Indeed,
he is often in a position to know the thera-
peutic value of certain drugs and their mof*t
effective combination better than many medi-
cal men. He dispenses for dozens of medicoes,
and has an opportunity of judging from results
the practical value of their different pre-
scriptions, whereas each individual pre-
scriber has his own personal experience only
to aid him, and depends on experiments and
books to further his knowledge. Many stu-
dents coming out of hospital are almost en-
tirely ignorant of therapeutics, being used
to prescribing from hospital pharmacopoeias.
As for counter prescribing, every chemist
knows he is forbidden by law to treat certain
diseases, but in minor ailments he is free
to use his own discretion.
* * * •
“X2X” : “M.D.’s” recent indictment of the
leniency of U.S.A. methods of dealing with
quacks was too sweeping. If the law in
some States is absurdly lax, in others it is
exceedingly strict. In Florida it is possible
to practise medicine on the strength of a
“dog license,” and the payment of 50 dollars
to the prescribed authority; but in Massa-
chusetts a seven to eight years’ course in
a medical school which lias become world-
famous for its teaching methods is demanded
prior to an examination by the State Medi-
cal Board. As for the Abrams diagnostic
methods, there are few States in which prac-
tioners who have lent themselves to this
humbug have not been severely dealt with ;
indeed, within the last few months several
have been gaoled—one of them .was sen-
tenced in July last at Toledo, Ohio. The
American system of permitting nobody to
practise medicine who is not licensed to do
so by the State Medical Board is one that,
if adopted in this country, would give the
authorities a chance of sweeping away the
horde of Chinese “doctors,” herbalists and
other impostors who trade on the ills and
sufferings of the ignorant.
* * * *
“8.8. C.” : 11. IT. Green, who built Banana-
land’s first motor-car, in 1900, has been re-
calling the history of the weird contraption.
Built to a design in the English Mechanic,
it had a 4-li.p. single-cylinder engine with
a 4in. stroke and a 3Jin. bore, and battery
ignition placed under the seat, so that when
it missed the driver took an upward flight.
The “carburetter” was a dangerous affair,
4in. by 6in., with an outlet pipe stuck in
the top. The differential was mounted on
a transverse shaft, and the gears consisted
of two wooden pulleys controlled by a sliding
jockey pulley; there was no reverse.. Wheels,
chains and sprocket wheels were imported,
and solid tyres fitted, though these occasion-
ally came off and raced the car. The frame
was of hardwood and metal plates, which
were later replaced by angle iron when pneu-
matic tyres were fitted. Steered with a
handle the machine was started by a crank
at the side. It had a radiator, too —12ft. of
copper pipe with discs soldered on —but even
with this a passenger who sat too near
the exhaust found liis trousers on fire. An
improvement was made later by tlie substi-
tution of a vertical twin-cylinder engine and
a cast-iron gear-box witli gun-metal cogs. The
whole concern cost about £3OO, and received
an order of merit in a local exhibition.
The reflections of “Penny Wise” :
Many years ago Melbourne Stock Exchange threw
away almost half its business by passing a rule, to
wipe out all agents and rebate commissions. When
the Exchange was most prosperous and more power-
ful, away back in the old Broken Hill and Mount
Lyell boom days, hundreds of agents were busy creat-
ing orders for which they usually received half
brokerage. This is a custom as old as the oldest
Stock Exchange, that of London. Every Stock
Exchange firm in London and Paris employs one or
more touts who belong to the big West End clubs
and societies. These men are known as “half-book”
brokers, who, as a rule, work purely for commission,
though' some of them are so expert in creating
orders that they are paid good salaries in addi-
tion. Following a different plan, a Collins-street or
Pitt-street sharebroker sits and waits for his clients
to bring or send him his daily orders. A few big
firms have thus collared the business, and the indi-
vidual broker, deprived of the help of his friends
amongst the accountants and legal managers, has been
struggling for a pittance. If it was not for the
orders from the trustee companies, many would have
to give up business. Now the Melbourne Exchange has
gone a step further. Until lately members of country
exchanges who did not carry on business within a
radius of 20 miles from the post office could claim
half commission from members of the Melbourne Stock
Exchange. To defeat two or three persons who joined
some Tasmanian Exchange as members and secured
half brokerage in Melbourne, the Exchange has
altered its rule to limit the division of commissions
to members of other stock exchanges who reside and
carry on their business within 30 miles of toe
exchange of which they are members. It may stop
one or two pirates, but that will only be achieved by
affronting those Melbourne men who have been
members of the Bendigo and Ballarat exchanges for
many years. Some day some Labor Government
will pass a law to make all sharebrokers sworn
brokers and widen the constitution of the Exchange.
RUNNING HER EASTING DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Old Man pads up and down the poop
Like a tiger pacing his cage;
The mate glares aloft when the canvas slams
On the masts, and he swears with rage.
The bo’s’n curses the doldrums, too,
For the skipper is hard to please,
And he flicks a coin, with a guilty air,
O’er the side “for to buy a breeze.”
The watch is growling as sailors growl
Who have chased false winds all day—
Those last faint puffs of the south-east “Trades,”
While the brave west winds delay.
The sun goes down in a, blood-red mist,
To the east rolls the oily sea,
And the Old Man’s gaze still searches the west
For the breeze that will set us free.
He wets his finger and holds it up,
And hope sets his face aglow.
“I think she’s coming,” he says to the mate;
“Call me up when it starts to blow.”
The mate prowls round like a restless ghost,
And he whistles a fnournful dirge,
As he sways to the roll of the idle' ship
When she lifts to the eastward surge.
But as eight bells strike he stands alert,
For a cool breath strikes his ear;
Then ready for action, he shouts “Stand by
The watch and see your ropes all clear!”
He hears the slapping of naked feet
On the deck as he turns his face
To the western sky; then he’ roars with glee:
“Tail on to the weather main-brace!”
Oh, the yards are swinging to meet the breeze
With a chorus of chantey cries,
And all her wings fill out with a crash
As away to the east she flics!
She’s taking it green o’er the weather rail,
And they’re setting the life-lines taut,
But the bo’s’n smiles, for he’s on his way
To his girl with the breeze he “bought.”
The Old Man’s shouting grog for the crowd,
No more will he fret and frown,
While the gale holds good, for the clipper Glance
Is “running her Easting down.”

Are you going Touring?
Pleasant company, a good car shod with
dependable tyres, and what an amount of
enjoyment one can cram into a motor tour
extending over a few days! No more ideal
way of spending one’s holiday exists. Variety
and charm await one in every direction.
The noise of the multitude may be left behind as
one gets out amongst the gums, or the gayer doings
at the seaside may be added to the pleasure of one’s
outing. The freedom of being able to go when and
where one likes is in itself a great legacy to
motorists. One essential to pleasurable touring is
that you start away on tyres capable of withstanding
hard service without giving trouble. The safest
thing to do is to fit your car or motor cycle with

and thereby ensure immunity from roadside tyre
troubles. The quality and strength of Dunlop Cords
makes them eminently suited for touring conditions

over all conditions of roads and tracks, leaves little
sign of wear on these covers. This service is
built into every “Dunlop” cover and tube, and it
is to be had simply by specifying “Dunlop” when

Warren’s Ride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UP on the Snowy this tale they tell
()f the cruellest river that ever broke
banks
To levy his toll on shuddering herds
And on whispering maize in its tasselled
ranks
That stand like an army brave and brown,
Keeping the gates of Orbost town.
It was late mid-summer. Lazy and low
The river lay like a shrunken snake
In his winter torpor; no breath of wind
Bade the lightest leaf on the hilltops quake.
The World slept, never an insect stirred,
Nor a fox-call wakened a nesting bird.
A reiver of reivers, as rivers go,
Who plays with the Snowy must load his
dice
And watch unsleeping and labor late,
Nor carry his gains tin- same way twice,
Lest this grim freebooter, this bandit bold,
Should sally down from his Alpine hold.
Treacherous? —yea. as the brindled cat
That slinks at night through the bamboo
brake,
Where the pools of shadow are doors of death
In the moonlight lure of a magic lake.
So is this river that breaks and mars.
And tosses the spoils on liis wide sludge bars.
Brown-haired Ina stirred in her sleep
On her couch in the old verandah bay.
Did she wake or sleep? Was it wind in the
trees ?
Or the roar of a river abroad for prey?
A moment she listened with bated breath —
The crashing willows drawn down to death!
Then swift to rouse them on light feet sped.
“Father! The river!” she cried. "The
flood!”
But lie sleepily bade her go back to bed.
The river? —why it was mostly mud !
She was dreaming, perhaps, or the rising
breeze
Howled in the high mahoganies.
She beat at the sill till he raised the blind.
From east or west or from north or south
Not a breath of wind —the summer nighty
Was black as the cave of a grey wolf's
mouth;
And out of the blackness he heard the roar
Of the river lashing his highest shore.
Will Warren had lived by the Snowy side,
Boy and man, through the years of stress
That slew the forest and slowly set
A young town there in the wilderness.
A bushman he, as his fathers were,
With the will to do and the pluck to dare.
There wasn’t much time to think things out.
His land was higher than most around,
But ten thousand head of the neighbors’
stock
Would be trapped out there on the lower
ground.
And there was a house where a lamp burned
low,
And a sick boy fought with a darker foe.
He saddled black Bessie and turned her head
In the eerie darkness, and forth they flew
To race the river, to dice with Death.
As the code of the Bush bids men to do,
Where the wide brown waters were swirling
down
'Twixt him and the lights of Orbost town.
Down at the bend ’neath the railway bridge,
Round Bessie’s fetlocks the water purred ;
She snorted and plunged, then lengthened her
stride
And shot through the night like a homing
bird,
On through the flood and the deafening roar
To the bridge—that was maybe a bridge no
more.
The water was up to the saddle girths;
But the bridge held good, and they raised
the roofs
In the sleeping town as the long street rang
To the steady beat of her galloping hoofs;
And the ’phone bells wakened the country-side
To save the cattle —to “out and ride.”
Will Warren turned his tired black mare
Back to the flood, there was one call more,
And never a ’phone-bell to shout it clear
Through the murk and the ravening river’s
roar.
The rising flood round the knee-pads creamed
Ere he hailed the house where the sick boy
dreamed.
But never a soul went the Reiver’s way
When his watery cohorts again withdrew,
Heavy with plunder of milky corn
That would swell no more to the sun or
dew,
Or stand in its season brave and brown,
Keeping the gates of Orbost town.
And never a hoof of ten thousand head,
Never a hoof but only four.
Lay for a toll in the Reiver’s bed
When back to his fastness he turned once
more.
And the four belonged to the mangy hide
Of a runt of a steer that was no one’s pride.
The dawn in the east was cold and grey
When lie cut the wires, with the flood at
his knee,
And gathered his beasts from the crawling
Death
That had turned the flats to a moaning
sea.
Then Will Warren went home, for his work
was done;
He had diced with the Reiver —had diced and
won.

MARIE E. ,T. PITT.
And God' Was Very Good to Them.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER they had finished tea the old
man helped his wife with the wash-
ing-up. Now and then he •would
put down a half-dried cup or plate to relight
his pipe. He wasn’t a very old man, as years
go, but his whiskers were unkempt and
Judstlv. and his limbs were stiff, and his back
bent with hard work and the endless struggle
to rear and support a family with his two
hands. He was called an unskilled laborer.
After the dishes were put away and the kit-
chen swept out, the woman busied herself
in the bedroom, first at this drawer and then
at that, or turning and tumbling out the
contents of great tin-boxes. The elder child-
ren were reading, and the younger ones at
their home lessons, all except little Peggy,
tin' baby, who toddled to and fro after her
mother, clinging to her skirts.
The old man filled and refilled his pipe,
and carried in great arms-full of wood; and
after that he filled the big kettle that always
stood on the stove, and saw that the hurri-
cane-lamp was filled and in working order.
Absorbed in his tasks, he spoke little to the
children, who, their lessons completed, drifted
off one by one to bed.
The woman came back to the kitchen.
“You oughter go to bed, Dad,” she said.
“You must be tired; and I think it’s nothing,
after all.”
“All right,” he answered, “but I’m keep-
ing old Peter in the yard to-night, anyhow.”
After his wife had collected pens and ink,
school-books and boots and socks that were
strewn about, she spoke again.
"Why don’t yer go to bed, Dad? I’m all
right; I’m going too.”
Till midnight he lay awake, fully dressed,
continuously smoking, and then he went
back to the kitchen. Ills wife was still there
putting a stitch here and a patch there;
and at her elbow was a pile of children’s
clothing.
"Thought I’d like a drink of tea,” he said,
half apologetically. “I’ll make a drop.”
When they had finished the tea she pointed
out to him where each child’s garments were
kept.
“Little Peggy’s things are in the big box;
Annie’s in the top drawer. Your shirts and
flannels and clean trousers are in the gin-
case.”
The old man went back to the little
room and dozed, fully dressed and booted.
There was no sign of red in the east when
she came to him, softly plucking at his sleeve.
“Dad, Dad,” she whispered, “I think you’d
better put the harness on old Peter.”
SO WASTEFUL OF HIM!
GROCER : “An’ ’ere’s a present for yer from the boss—a almanack
fer the Noo Year, Mrs. Praddles.”
MRS. PRADDLES : “Bless his ’cart, he needn’t ’ave done that. The
one he gave me last year’s as good as new.”
In a second the old man was on his feet,
the pipe still in his hand, and unconsciously
he put it in his mouth and fumbled for the
matches. In the dim light he fondled her,
one arm across her shoulder.
“It’s all right, Dad,” she assured him.
“I’m all right. Dad ; but I think we might
as well go. Don’t wake the children,” she
warned; “they’d only be frightened, and
they’ll sleep till you get back.”
Steadily old Peter jogged across the un-
fenced plain and through the belts of scrub,
down steep gullies and over narrow ridges.
He knew every inch of the way, even in this
dark morning, and as the grey dawn was
breaking they came to the hill that led up
to the township.
The little grass-fringed street was deserted,
the shops looked drab and uninviting. Old
Peter was jogging very slowly now, and
at the steepest pinch he slowed down to a
walk —just where dusty wreaths and crosses
and artificial flowers rested mournfully against
a black background in a window, and a
rusty-looking hearse poked its shabby nose
from a shed at the side. The old man saw
it all, and hurriedly jerked at Peter’s mouth,
urging him to “Git up. git up !” He talked
to his wife in quick, husky tones, pointing
out this and that on the other side of the road,
common things that they had both seen
dozens of times before, till they were well past
the gloomy-looking place. But she had
noticed it, and was toying uneasily with the
fringe of her scarf.
“I feel scared this time, Dad.” she said.
“I’m not as young as I was. I wish now
that I’d let you engage the doctor; it would
ha’ been safer.”
He took one of the rough, restless hands
and patted it. noticing how the wedding-ring
was worn to almost a thread, and that the
old-fashioned pattern was gone from the
keeper. How sharp and bevelled the edges
of it were! Perhaps his mind went deep
down into the past to the day when he had
slipped it there so easily. It would have
to be filed or cut. to remove it now. Pure
Ballarat cold it was: and it had cost 225. 6d.
in those far-off, old days when that seemed
a lot of money.
“I did engage the doctor,” he said quickly,
“an’ I didn’t like to tell you before; you
mighter worried about the expense an’ all
that. The store bill’ll have to wait, that’s
all; an’, anyhow, they never did press us.
Old Mitchell knows we’re all right.” He
talked rapidly, clipping his words in his en-
deavor to run her mind from dwelling on
the expense.
Down the hill, on the other side of the
town, they trotted briskly, the jangle of the
chain-traces and the flop, flop of the unshod
feet of the horse sounding like a dirge in
the woman’s ears. The first puff of smoke
curled from the chimney of the weatherboard
cottage where they halted; the door opened
and a flock of’ nondescript fowls crowded,
cackling, round an elderly woman who came
out, bowl in hand. Seeing the trap, she
flung the grain broadcast and hurried
over.
“I wasn’t expectin’ you for a week,” she
said, and helped the woman to alight; “but
it doesn’t matter. There’s plenty of room;
you’re the only one.”
The old man got down, too, and as his
wife kissed him amongst the nicotine-tainted
whiskers she whispered: “Don’t you worry,
Dad; I’ll be all right. An’, Dad, I’m real
glad that you thought of getting the doctor.
We’ll manage the expense somehow.”
As he turned to leave her she called him
back
"Look after poor little Peggy,” she told
him, “and don’t let the others bully her, an’
bring them down to see me as soon as you
can. Poor little Peggy, she’s only a baby
herself yet! An’, Dad, don’t you worry too
much about keeping things tidy and all that,
and don’t bother about the wasliin’ and scrub-
bin’ ; I’ll soon be home again.”
“That’ll be all right,” he answered. “You’d
better git in now. Goo’-byc.”
And lie drove off, the reins jumbled on his
knee as he filled his pipe.
He had the tea made and the porridge ready
before tlie children woke and had washed
the sleep from their faces. They were at
the table before they missed their mother.
It was little Peggy that first called for Mum.
“Yes, where is
Mum?” asked the
others together.
The old man
fumbled with his
cup awhile and
said: “Well, yer
see, we sorter knew
old Gran. Jones
was sick, an’ your
Mum thought she’d
like to go in an’
see her. We started
early in case it
might turn out hot
or cold or some-
thing,” he finished
up weakly.
And then he re-
membered that he’d
forgotten to feed
the fowls, and as
he went out he
told them to
“Hurry up now,
and I’ll give yer a
ride to school, and
Peggy can go to-
day. too.”
The elder girls
looked at each
other, but said no-
thi n g, and all
through the meal
they were very
quiet, except little
Peggy, who whim-
pered now and then
for her mother.
When they all were
ready he lifted the
little ones to the
sulky, their boots
unpolished and
their little lunches
tied clumsily in
newspaper. The
dirty dishes were
in an untidy pile
on the table.
As they trotted
on the old man
told them stories—.
“Jack, the Giant Killer,” “Red Rid-
ing Hood,’’ and so on—and at the school-
gate he said to them, “If Mum isn’t coming
home to-night I’ll take yer all down to Gran.
Jones’s to see her.” They wont into the school
hand in hand, little Peggy in the middle,
not smiling nor crying, but dumbly wonder-
ing what everything meant.
The old man drove over the hill again;
and although the pipe was still in his mouth
there was no trace of smoke from his lips
now.
Gran, met him at the gate. On tip-toe she
came, a hand held up warningly. “I’ve got
news for you,” she said. “A fine boy, and
nine and a half pounds weight.”
“A boy!” mumbled the old man, hardly
for a moment understanding what it meant.
“How is she? An’ is everything all right?”
he asked eagerly.
He was making long strides in the direc-
tion of the door; but the woman’s hand held
him.
“You can’t go in now,” she commanded.
“She’s asleep, and so’s the boy. Come in
this afternoon and you can bring the
children.”
Then she led him stealthily into the back
room, and by gesture bade him wait. In a
moment she joined him again, bearing a
tiny* bundle swaddled up in shawl and
blanket.
“You can just have one peep at him,”
she said; and the old man peeped and saw
his first-born son, pink and pimply-faced,
and with a fringe of sandy hair that was
like his own showing beneath the head cov-
ering.
He went home again, the reins flapping
loosely on the horse’s back, and old Peter
taking his own time over the trip, and pick-
ing his own tracks.
The house seemed strange and silent. It
was odd for him to see the fire out in the
stove and the kitchen untidy, and he missed
little Peggy's chatter. When he set to work
his mind wouldn’t settle down, even his pipe
S'omed to be contrary, and refused to stay
alight. Half-way through the washing-up
he went out to water the dog; but he nad
forgotten to bring a vessel to carry the water,
and as he returned for it he saw that the
harness was still on old Peter, and the dog
did not get a drink just then : and when he
returned to the washing-up the water was
cold and crusted with grease, and the fir"
was out again. And it was the same all day
till it was time to go for the children.
lie met them at the school-yard gate, and
after they had driven a little way lie told
them.
“Now, what d’yer think?” he asked. The
doctor came to see old Gran. Jones to-day,
an’ he had a spare little baby, a boy, with
him. An’ would yer believe it, yer mum
bought it! Isn’t that grand, eh? A nice
little brother for you, Peggy.”
But Peggy didn’t understand ; the unusual-
ness of everything had her little mind be-
wildered.
Gran, let them in just for a minute ; and
they crowded round the bed, the big girls
bright-eyed and eager to take the tiny stran-
ger to tlieir hearts. But Peggy was shy and
nervous, and sidled first this way and then
that towards the head of the bed : and as
the old man lifted her to kiss her mother he
could feel her little heart pounding. Then
she sobbed bitterly; and as practical Gran.
Jones whisked her out the pillow beside
the mother’s face was wet with tears, and
they were not all Peggy’s.
When the other girls had kissed their
mother and had one more peep at the wee
baby, Gran, beckoned them out.
As tlie old man leaned over his wife she
forgot the big outstanding debt at the store,
she forgot the shame she had felt of her plain,
unbleached nightdress when the minister’s
wife called. The years of drudgery that were
behind, the hopelessness of the future —all
these things she forgot as she whispered to
him. “A boy, Dad,” she said, “just what
we wanted ! God has been very good to us.”

The Spirit of Brisbane.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
~\\T HAT is the spirit of Brisbane? I
VY' have been here many years and
have failed so far to diagnose it.
It is furtive, I think, and shrinks from the
light of day. Brisbane’s body is obvious —
large and sprawly, ill-clad in places, ex-
quisitely garden-trimmed in others. Not
symmetrical at all; for when Brisbane was
laid out we did not give town-planning dele-
gations nice holidays to set things in the
way they should go, by force of precept, for
us. Brisbane laid itself out. In some re-
spects it has remained corpse-like since. Not
in others: like the giraffe, its legs appear to
run different ways; some go more quickly
than others. This makes it trip occasionally
and sometimes fall, but it has the Australian
grit: it gets up and begins again. There
will be a lot of trimming down, and some re-
setting of limbs, before Brisbane can be the
beautiful city she hopes to become, beautiful
with the real beauty that has its root in fair
natural surroundings. She does not need
the artificial aids of Melbourne on the Yarra.
She is naturally comely; but real estate,
with town allotments for a soul, by tightly
corseting and bandaging her up in the wrong-
places, and letting her sag in others, has
interfered cruelly with that loveliness.
Once there were vine scrubs about Bris-
bane, and cool, mossy places, and green
walks, like those which Memory ribbons anew
for us in the dream aisles of leafy Tam-
bourine. Brisbane was once a place of fern-
sown hills. We came with our galvanised-
iron and our hideous house paints, and our
“uniform workmen’s dwellings,” and lo ! our
maid of the wild was a disfigured harridan.
She is young still under the ugly trappings
men have put upon her; give her a chance
and she will be beautiful, too. Iler spirit
is cowed: it hides somewhere among those
lost vine scrubs. Perhaps that is why we
cannot trace it to-day.
I do not believe she is coquettishly elusive:
there is none of the trained Sydney syren
about her, the syren trailing robes of blue
and gold, and scented like the Orient.
Though she might incline to the clean
geranium perfumes of Old Japan, I think she
would nrefer to distil her own sweet waters
from the fragile aroma of the wattle, the
faint, oily tang of eucalyptus. There is
about her nothing of the painted lady, nor
the ruby-mouthed geisha flirting her stork-
decorated fan. She is really rather re-
spectable, inclined to piety and good works,
and to washing her fresh-complexioned face
in honey-dew, with a healthful tendency to
roam the wide places and return with her
feet golden in pollen dust.
The part of Brisbane which is all city
does not, and never can, house her spirit: her
body lies inert among the streets and electric-
lit facades with which she is striped ; her
spirit watches, finger on lip, from amid the
bosky hills. And that is why we can pace the
highways of Brisbane and find her defying
definition. She seems to have no special
atmosphere. Close your eyes and the woman
that is Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or
Perth is visualised in definite outlines. Not
so Brisbane. She appears to the visitor
somehow unfinished, spiritually, mentally,
corporeally. Here and there her hands reach
for higher things. She stirs at Springtime,
and her soul gleams in the mauve-blue of the
imported jacarandas and the gold of her
homeland’s silky-oaks. Everywhere she
laughs in flowers, and one fancies, on a night
of mellow moons, her hiding spirit comes
down from the hills and creeps into that
great, unfinished, untrained, untidy body of
hers. By day she withdraws, her voice
drowned by the clash of trams and over-
whelmed by the unceasing and increasing
army of motor-cars.
A stranger once said to me she thought
Brisbane had “an open face.” I don’t. A
blank one, she might have said, out of whose
eyes look a shy ineffectuality. Should her
spirit ever come down from the ranges and
the amethyst mists to abide ® a town of
noble buildings, clean streets and frequent
and park-like pleasances, then it may be. that
many will flock from far away to view at last
the whole woman, gowned in her grace and
jewelled with opals of Art. Literature and
all the rainbow fancies of her dream.

30,000 Motor Bodies Annually.
The success which has enabled Holden’s to build annually no
fewer than 30,000 Motor Bodies from their two separate works
—with branches in each State—may be ascribed to these several
outstanding facts: Knowledge, properly applied, of the world’s
best methods; efficient organisation; selected men, and huge manu-
facturing works on the latest plan, which permit of buying in the best
market at correct prices; facile production of enormous orders, and a
team of skilled artist designers, engineers and expert craftsmen.
Six years ago Holden’s had a fixed determined idea as to what Australia
required to compete with the world’s best works. Comprehensive plans
were made, large-scale operations were adopted, and to-day Holden’s
produce bodies in any and every design for every taste and requirement _

Beauty and Comfort.
Holden Bodies are a revelation of beauty and
comfort, and the effort for betterment never stops.
No limitation is placed upon the artist designers and
supervisors other than the building of the best. The
main points aimed at are restful comfort, strength,
exquisite appearance, and finished craftsmanship.
Whenever you see a distinctive model of perfect
symmetry, designed to
last, you know it is a
Holden Body.

The Lonely Land.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r ■'VnF hills stand in great groups and

Waver away and each tree wake
and shine;

wine

The sleeping land appears awhile to dream.
To dream of what? Of thin bird-notes

A cloak o’er life that will appear again.
In this old land the quiet years in going
Back to the bourne of things have left no

Of men or dreams or tales to smile, all-

A quiet benediction on the hosts—
The weary hosts of trees whose green boughs
ever
Summer and winter flutter foolishly.
Void is the shade, the glow upon the river
And all the crystal sunshine eyes can see.
The evening comes and brims the lonely

It limns with light the little swift that

Above the short brown tufts. Now slowly

Of untrod forest; fade, grow dim and dimmer,
Recede like ghosts into grey distances.

In the last flush of light, and, ears back,
pause to listen,
Nibble awhile and softly steal away.
No witch, no night elf makes the child-heart
quiver,
Glimnsed black against the pearly upper
light;
Yet still the small trees spread their arms
and shiver —
The silence draws too near them in the
night.
And while the earth breathes faint benignant
sweetness,
dim echoings of death,
' stars slip out with bright ethereal fleet-
ness
And shiver, shiver, shiver, catching breath.
It seems a fear runs naked in the darkness,

head,
Fleeing from naught but at the white tree’s
starkness,

L. PATRICIA FRANCIS.
With a Wireless Squadron.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
miiE
Australian Wireless Squadron,
which served in Mesopotamia and
Persia from 1916 to 1919, seems to
have been the ugly duckling of the A.I.F.
During its lifetime few people outside its
immediate field of influence knew anything
about it, and in these later days of official
histories ignorance of the woi’k of the unit
is startling and unfortunate.
The operations against Turkey in Meso-
potamia were, in the first instance, con-
trolled by the Indian Government. Fao,
Basrah, Kurnah and Amara were quickly
taken, and Ivut was occupied soon after.
Then with startling suddenness Townsliend's
army appeared almost at the walls of Bag-
dad, 500 miles up-river. But it was too
sudden. Townshend fell back on Ivut, was
besieged, made a gallant resistance till
further resistance was impossible, and then
our flag came down.
It was while the gallant defender was still
hanging on in Ivut that a wireless pack troop
from Australia first kicked up the ancient
dust of Mesopotamia—on March 19, 1916.
When this troop arrived at Colombo no one
knew anything about it, but as it was for
Mesopotamia it was sent on to Bombay.
Bombay knew no more than Colombo; but
Mesopotamia was up the Gulf, so up the Gulf
the troop went. On arrival at Basrah the
men were quickly set to work. Their equip-
ment, carried on paekhorses, was specially
designed for work with cavalry, so the troop
was split into small stations to be scattered
along the front. Then sufficient troops
arrived from Australia to complete a squad-
ron. and from this time were associated,
under a single command, with Maoriland
wireless-men. The unit was officially known
as the Ist (Anzae) Wireless Squadron; but
the men who belonged to it only used the
name officially, and on the departure of the
Maorilanders in 1918 they became the Ist
(Australian) Wireless Squadron.
It is not easy to discover why an Austra-
lian unit was sent into Mesopotamia, especi-
ally as an English wireless squadron was
already in the field, and, apart from some air-
force men, no other Australian unit served
there. From the moment of disembarkation
at Colombo all contact with an Australian
lI.Q. ceased, the only apparent connecting-
link being an Australian Pay Office Staff in
Bombay, which was established some time
later. A story was current among the men
that the unit was on loan to the Indian
Government, then in control, which assumed
all financial responsibility. Whether or not
this was so, or whether any other responsi-
bility was assumed, is difficult to discover.
Certainly the squadron suffered severely from
neglect, and at least one man returned to
Sydney in 1920 in the salf-same tunic with
which he was issued in Australia in 1916.
A kindly Jewish tailor in Bagdad had taken
it to pieces and turned it to make it a bit
more presentable. There was another story
told to the effect that signal arrangements
in Mesopotamia were unsatisfactory, and
that someone, remembering Anzac. asked for
Anzacs, on the assumption that nothing would
daunt them. It may have been true; with-
out a doubt they later were given a hand
in one or two hopeless and desperate tasks,
But not minding why they were sent they
were there; and, after the Mesopotamian
Commission had delivered its judgment on
affairs that were chaotic and rapidly becom-
ing barbaric, the War Office took over con-
trol* whole army was then officially re-
labelled the Mesopotamian Expeditionary
lorce. and as such it completed the cam-
paign, stretching its long arm as far as Anah
on the Euphrates, beyond Mosul on the
ligris, into the heart of Central Kurdistan,
and, farthest of all. to Baku, on the distant
( aspian ; and throughout the whole cam-
paign and into its farthest limits the Anzac
Wireless Squadron was its never-silent voice,
I ack. waggon and motor-stations went every-
where, over desert and mountain; at one
stage there were sixteen stations scattered
over the immense area of operations that
stretched from the Arabian Desert to South-
ern Russia. In addition to these mobile
stations there were some special army sets
working at Bagdad, intercepting enemy
traffic, and gathering a harvest of secrets.
Soon after the fall of Bagdad a dramatic
meeting of Russian and British forces took
place at Khahikin, near the Persian frontier.
The Partizanski forces, under General
Bicharakoff, had come down from the Per-
sian plateau, having driven the Turk north-
wards. When this force retraced its steps
an Australian wireless station went with it.
At Kermansliah (240 miles from Bagdad)
the party was snowed in for many months.
Edmund Candler, Daily Mail correspon-
dent with the forces, describes meeting the
Anzacs on their return: “I went witli an
escort to bring back a wireless detachment
who had been with the Cossacks the best part
of a year in Kermanshah.... First we met
the advance guard of the mounted Persian
gendarmerie in their black coats, then the
Anzac detachment and their wireless carts
drawn by stout mules. Their faces were
black with wind and weather, and the white
butterfly on their slouch hats faded to a lichen
grey.” Wandering Kurds had given this
party all the trouble even a mob of hard
Australians could reasonably ask for.
When General Danterville came to Bag-
dad with his “Hush, Hush” army, three Aus-
tralian stations trailed after him to Baku.
One went right into the oil city with the
General, sharing the wireless stations there
with the Bolshevists—turn and turn about,
This Baku enterprise was a series of thrill-
ing episodes, not the least of which were the
retirement of the Armenian irregulars from
the line at a critical stage, the persistent and
deadly opposition of the Communists, the
decimation of the small British force, and a
miraculous escape in the dark,
Another station, of the waggon type, had
a hand in the operations towards' Tabriz,
The station (which had taken over at Hama-
dan, Persia, from the last of the home-going
Russians) was attached to a column of
Gurkhas, to deal with a Turkish force which
was bl the neighborhood. There were no
made roads, bridges over streams had to be
widened, and there were hills that could only
be negotiated by unlimbering the waggons
a nd manhandling them. On more than one
occasion the wheel-hub scored a hole in the
mud wa ll of a house while taking a sharp
bend in some narrow village street, and on
the return journey there was a trail of dead
an d dying horses half the way. For food the
m en lived on what could be got from a
famine-stricken country, and of medical aid
and necessities there was little enough to be
negligible.
third station went northwards from the
ma i n line of communications to Sonneli.
This was a pack station and travelling was
no t so difficult. But at an altitude of
GOOOft. snow and cold and poor food tem-
,)f,rod the joy of life.
The Turk had, throughout the campaign.
m ade very good use of a fine Telefunken set
at Mosul. When our cavalry had effectively
mottled matters in that area.'and cleared the
road through ancient Nineveh, our mechanics
had a pretty task repairing the “spiked” set.

There was some talk of it. or what was left
of it, finding a resting-place in the Austra-
lian War Museum. It may hoi there,
Three-fourths of the squadron returned to
Australia in February, 1919, the remainder
being retained to accompany a punitive ex-
pedition against Kurdish tribesmen north of
Mosul. The Kurds had been cultivating a
hobby of murdering political officers and their
men, and a rather successful effort was made
to teach the wild hillmen the error of their
ways. The little force went up hill and
down vale, calling at all sorts of squalid vil-
lages, in all sorts of almost inaccessible places,
Wireless was, on this as on other occasions,
the only certain means of communication.

him, peppered the station with rifle-fire. On

standard equipment. Of course, they differ vastly
from mere “semi-balloon” types. And note this
important fact: Hudson has not just “added balloon
tires.” Special design of running and steering gear
are provided to compensate for the radical differ-
ences balloon tires bring. The result is the easiest
steering and riding Hudson ever built. Braking
efficiency is almost doubled.
And yet Hudson’s margin of price advantage over
comparable cars is more apparent than ever. Of
course, the preference it enjoys everywhere rests
wholly upon this consistent supremacy of value.
Everyone knows its reputation for performance,
reliability and trouble-free service.
Today’s Hudson gives greater economy of fuel, oil
and maintenance, as well as added smoothness in
every phase of operation. Low cost of replacement
parts is another unrivalled economy advantage of
the Hudson policy.
The Hudson builders are the sixth largest producers
of motor cars in the world, with more than 14 years
of successful manufacturing experience. Such sta-
bility coupled with a policy of service satisfaction
are important factors in the enjoyment of your car.

The Mallee Hen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’AI boss over the board at Dirrabunga-
long, down on the Bogan, and the
twenty stands is taken before I hears
from Billy the Dodger. He’s out across
the Darling for over a year, dog-trapping
an’ measuring up Western land leases with
a survey gang, an’ because he never writes
me a letter I don’t keep a pen for him. He
lobs at the shed the day after we calls the
roll, an’ when he finds there’s nothing doing
his language ain’t too polite. He’s always
careless in his talk in the old days, but lie’s
worse after being with them surveyors on
account of one bloke in the camp who’s reli-
gious having taught him things out of the
Scriptures.
We has a bit of a pitch that night where
lie’s camped out at the Government tank, on
the stock-route, an’ I tells him about another
job I knows that’s going.
Dodger’s a proud bloke when lie’s been
teased by hard luck. He’s on his dig, an’
that’s why he’s camping on the tank instead
of at the hut, an’ eating his own scran in-
stead of the station’s. But when I mentions
a job he uncurls liisself a bit.
“What sort of yakker is it?” he asks.
“Driving the mail from Narromine to the
Bogan,” I tells him. “Three trips a week,
all daylight running an’ a fiver a week an’
tucker.”
“What’s the prads like?” he says. “An
the shanghai?”
“She’s a t.horoughbrace, an’ old one of
Cobb and Co.’s. And the mokes is Lachlan
bred and fat.”
“The Lord be praised!” he says. “I’ll
chuck me bread on them waters an’ it’ll
come back a thousand to one.”
I don’t understand his talk about taking-
long odds with bread an’ water, but I guess
he’s on. And that’s how Dodger comes to
be mailman that season on the Alacquaric-
Bogan track.
Dirrabungalong shed’s on the side of the
stock-route an’ about twelve mile from the
homestead. Old Springway, the owner, only
comes out once a week, leaving the running
of the shearing to me an’ the English book-
keeper. And because lie’s a decent old bloke
I keeps the shearers up in the collar, an’
even gets the rouseabouts emu-bobbing an’
burr-cutting when wet sheep’s declared.
Me an’ the book-keeper lives like princes
in a bit of a cottage well away from the
hut. A boundary-rider an’ his missus lives
in it most of the year, but, they being away
on a holiday to Orange, we has the use of
the place an’ all the furniture. A gin from
the abos.’ camp on the river does the clean-
ing for us.
One day me an’ Hathaway, which is the
book-keeper, is out at the Government tank
waiting for Dodger to come along with the
mail. There’s been a thunderstorm the day
before, an’ as all the sheep in the shelter-
shed is cut out early, the boys is loafing
about putting in time washing clothes or
playing two-up. It’s one of them clean,
clear days you gets out on the plains in
the summer-time. The sun’s a bit warm, but
there’s a little breeze rolling along, just mov-
ing the tops of the pines and the grey box,
and sometimes rising in little willy-willies
like red pillars reaching up into the sky.
We sees a cloud of dust at the far end of
the billabong drifting along steady across
the grass.
“Here’s Dodger,” I yells, because I can
see the horses through the dust-cloud.
“Bai Jove, yes,” says the book-keeper.
“And aw—-I’m blest if lie hasn’t got a lady
passenger on the box-seat, what!”
When the shanghai gets to the tank-block
gate I sees there’s a tart on board all right,
and an’ old bloke sitting with her on the
outside.
“They look like a honeymoon—aw—
couple,” says the book-keeper. “The old
gentleman has his arm —aw —about her
waist, what!”
Sure enough the bloke an’ the tart’s in
holts, an’ every now an’ then her head flops
on his shoulder like as if she’s kidding to
be knocked up an’ wants a spell. As they
comes closer I gets the shock of my life. Hang
me if the tart don’t turn out to be the
Alallee Hen, a piece who’s been knocking
about the back country for years, following
the shearing round ! I never knew her right
name, or if she had one, but she’s called the
Alallee Hen in every shanty, sliearing-shed
and bush town from the Gulf to Alildura.
And she’s a beaut. She’d pinch a traction-
engine if she could get away with it.
When the shanghai stops I sees Dodger
tip me a big, broad wink. “They’re balmy
in Gillyliad,” he yells out, and starts laugh-
ing fit to bust.
I don’t understand his new talk, but I
tips he’s made a rough joke by the way
the book-keeper grins.
The Alallee Hen springs down over the
wheel an’ comes rushing over to me like as
if I’ve just hit a shanty an’ am well chequed.
She sticks out her two paws an’ clutches
mine, shaking them as if she’s working the
pump.
“My dear manager,” she says, “I hope the
shearing’s getting on well, and that you are
looking after my interests carefully.”
I don’t quite get wdiat she’s driving at,
but I says, “Aly oath !” on spec.
Then she starts talking about the banks
pushing her for the mortgage on the run,
an’ about the trouble she’ll have finding
money to pay us for shearing her sheep, an’
how everyone tries to squash a poor, lone
widder. She’s yelling this out loud, an’
when I squints at the coach there’s the old
bloke that’s been clawing her shaking his
head solemn as jn old working bullock with
the gripes, and Dodger winking and grinning
like a bloke with the dry horrors coming on.
I can’t make this business out, but I gets
the staggers when she puts up her next one.
“I will remain here to-night to check your
accounts,” she says, cool as the bottom of
a pub-cellar, “an’ Air. Galloway will be my
guest. You must fix up the accommodation.”
I’m just starting to tell her off when I
catches the office from Dodger.
“Have it your own way, Hen,” I says:
“but old Springway’s due to-morrow, and
lie’ll dog you off the run if he cops you
here.”
Then the old bloke hops down. He’s a
poddy little cove with buck teeth an’ a mo
like a handful of binder-twine. He’s got one
milky eye, an’ a mean nose like a sheep-
killing dog. His voice is the saddest thing
you ever hears. When he speaks the first
time I thinks he’s having a weep over some-
thing, an’ moves up to sympathise.
Before I can get back to the road Dodger
has driven off, so I don’t get the strength
of things at all. I puts it on the Alallee
Hen to wise me, but she starts blubbering,
an’ says:
“Jim, please call me Airs. Anstruther until
we leave with Billy the Dodger on the coach
to-morrow, and toll all the boys to do the
same. It’s for the sake of my poor little
child. I’ll never forget you.”
I suppose I must have agreed, because
after I fixes her up in the cottage, and rigs
a doss for Galloway and meself and the
book-keeper under a couple of 6 x S flies
on the bank of where the river ought to be,
I tells the shearers and the shed-hands what
she wants.
“Ribuck.” says Talbragar Allport, who’s
the rep. “We’ll call her Airs. Anstruther.
But if she rats our duds w r e’ll chuck her in
the tank.”
After tea the Alallee Hen and old Gallo-
way comes strolling over to the men’s hut.
The boys is sprawled about, smoking and
yarning, and don’t take much notice of her
at first.
“Good evening, boys. I hope the shear-
ing is progressing well,” she says, an’ winks
at Talbragar.
“lvly oath, yes. Airs. Gorstrutlier,” he
answers. “We’ll have 600 bales the way
they’re cuttin’.”
“Oh, how nice!” she says, sweet as treacle.
“I didn’t think you’d be interested,” chips
in Derriwong Tom.
“Indeed, yes,” she comes back, winking
again. “I’m showing my dear friend Mr.
Galloway, from England, my beautiful
station, and he's very interested in the shear-
ing, too.”
This knocks us all sideways. Nobody says
nothing. Nobody wants to. Alost of them
has been caught by the Mallee Hen one time
or another, an’ as it ain’t their funeral they
don’t squeak. But because I reckon it’s no
good to Gundy, I decides to give the old bloke
the dinkum oil before she lambs him down. I
tries to head him off, but the Alallee Hen
takes a tumble and shepherds him like a
kelpie does a mob of rioting hoggets. After
trying for an hour, an’ seeing that Galloway
liisself isn’t too Keen on my company, I lets
it go at that.
Hathaway, the book-keeper, not having
seen the Alallee Hen before, although he had
heard of her often enough, tries to flirt with
her a bit, but chucks it when she props at
his winks, an’ the old bloke gets quite offen-
sive to him.
“Let the old —aw —blightah meet his—-aw
—doom,” he says to me, quite mournful, as
we marches over to our doss.
Next morning the Alallee Hen has the old
bloke out on the board when the whistle
blows. The boys has the time of their lives
playing up to the leg-pulling she’s doing. For
Air. Galloway’s benefit they pass broad re-
marks about what a wonderful woman Airs.
Gorstrutlier is, an’ how marvellous it is that
some bloke hasn’t married such a rich widow
an’ took charge of her station. Talbragar
works off a beauty. He’s chopping a burry,
disli-faced comeback wether an’ calls the
Alallee Hen across. She an’ the old bloke
toddle over.
“I thought,” says he, “you’d like to see
Bogan Prince, your champion stud ram.
Isn’t he a beaut?”
They stares at the ugly wether that Tal-
bragar’s wigging as carefully as if he’s a din-
kum stud.
“I think I paid too much for him,” says
the Alallee Hen.
“Five thousand guineas was a low figure,”
puts in Talbragar carelessly.
“Bai Jove!” yells old Galloway; an’ before
he can get a proper screw at the sheep Tal-
bragar boots it down the chute. After that
THE WAY IS SO OPEN.
GWENDOLINE : “ Freddy, why are men all
such backbiters?”
FREDERICK : “Heavens, Gwen —what can we
do when we are offered such facilities!”
I gets sick of listening to them kidding the
old goat, but the w r ay he bleats “Bai Jove!”
till you can hear it down at the wool-presses
and over the hum and buzz of the machines,
shows they’re giving him his money’s worth.
About eleven o’clock the Mallee Hen gets
ready to pick up the coach again, an’ as she’s
walking out to the gate with old Galloway,
an’ me an’ Hathaway tailing along behind
with their bags, I hears her pitching him her
tale. According to what she says there’s a mort-
gage of £3OOO on the run, an’ because she’s
refused to marry the bank manager, he’s
threatened to foreclose. She kids she don’t
understand business, an’, being a widow, she
won’t go to no one for advice, because every-
one’s robbed her since her poor husband
died. When Galloway tries to tell her
about other banks giving mortgages, she
pretends she don’t understand, an’ begins to
blubber like as if she’s been tipped off about
the death of a relative. This upsets the
old goat an’ he slips an arm round her, hug-
ging her out there in the dust as though
he’s going to start the quadrilles.
“Bai Jove!” he says. “Don’t you worry,
ah, my pooah little darling. per-
mit me to attend to your affairs. ’
Ale an’ Hathaway nearly has a fit when
she grabs him round the neck an’ sobs: ’ Oh,
Cecil, dear!”
Dodger pushes the old shanghai on the
scene just then, an’ just as they climbs
aboard I sees old Snringway driving across
the plain towards the shed. The Alallee Hen
spots him, too, an’ makes the Dodger tease
the cuddies into a canter so as to get through
the gate before he meets them. Billy rises
to the occasion and beats the boss to it by a
quarter of a mile, an’ the shanghai disap-
pears in a cloud of dust round a bend of the
billabong.
“Who are the passengers on the coach t
asks Springway, as he pulls up.
“The Alallee Hen an’ some old bloke,” I
says.
“That hell-cat of a woman,” lie roars.
“For two pins I’d send into Narromine and
THE RADIO HABIT.
“Do you golf, dearie ?”
“No, I listen-in to hubby.”
warn the police about her. It's not right
that she should be at large.”
“Live and let live,” says I.
With that he goes on to the board an’
spends the day poking about. Neither of
us mentions the Malice Hen again.
Next week they has the polo carnival in
Narromine. Spring-way's been at the shed
in the morning, an’ is just ready to start for
town, when Billy the Dodger lumbers along
with the mail. On the box seat is sitting a
little poddy bloke that I recognises as Gallo-
way when he jumps down into the dust. As
he walks over to me an’ the boss, Dodger
starts swearing again, saying something
about flattery of the tongue of a strange
woman an’ delivering a roe from the hand
of the hunter. I’m a bit ashamed of his
language because the boss don’t know him
like I do.
“Bai Jove,” says Galloway, “is Mrs. An-
struther lieah?”
“Who’s Mrs. Anstruther?” asks the boss.
“The—ah—lady that owns this station,”
is the answer.
The boss glares at the little bloke for a
minute, then he steps up to him prompt.
“I own this run,” he snaps out, “an’
every hoof on it. My name’s Springway, an’
I’m a widower.”
You should have seen Galloway. His eyes
sticks out like them quandongs you see on
fancy picture-frames.
“But, bai Jove,” he splutters. “I advanced
Airs. Anstruther a large sum of —ah —money
to—ah liquidate a mortgage on the place.”
The boss turns to me then.
“Who’s Mrs. Anstruther?” he asks.
“The Malice Hen,” I says.
After the boss> recovers from his laughing
fit he leads Galloway off an’ I suppose gives
him the wdiole strength of it. I hears the
Englishman describing the solicitor who put
the job through, and from what he says I
tips that it was old “Slaughter,” who always
worked in with the Hen. Anyhow, the goat
comes back to where Billy’s still waiting on
the shanghai, and hauls himself on board as
solemn as if it’s a hearse and him going to
drive the corpse.
“Bai Jove, drivah,” he says, “take me any-
wheah away from heah.”
“As yer sow,” I hears Dodger cursing
softly, “so shall yer darned well reap.” An’
the coach moves off.
GORDON BENNETT.
The Chidley Memorial.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER the figure of Chidley, garbed in
next-to-nature attire, had vanished
from Sydney streets, his followers,
whose number was considerable, came to-
gether'to discuss the question of perpetuating
the memory of their leader and his no-meat,
no-whisky and no-clothes philosophy. The
Chief Disciple was for a combined demonstra-
tion of Chidleyites in the Domain the follow-
ing Sunday. Nobody was very enthusiastic
about it. For myself, I explained that I
didn’t have any old short trousers or ragged
shirts to wear. They all offered to buy me
some; but I refused to allow them to waste
their money on me. Finally, after an awk-
ward silence, the Chief Disciple arose and
said he would himself appear in Chidley
attire the following Sabbath. His face wore
the expression that belongs exclusively to
martyrs and shining examples. There was
nothing of the white flame of enthusiasm
showing; in fact, the Chief Disciple’s inward
disgust was more or less faithfully reflected
on his countenance. His thoughts might
have been: “What’s the good of being a
leader if you have to do the dirty work
yourself?” But when he made his announce-
ment it was greeted with a burst of applause.
We felt freed of a great weight of respon-
sibility.
We were all early at the Domain entrance
that day. For one reason, we believed a
new era would be ushered in when the Chief
Disciple made his appearance. For another,
we wanted to see how the wondering popu-
lace, that had got rid of Chidley comfortably
and settled back with a contented grunt,
would look upon the revival. All eyes were,
therefore, bent on the road along which the
new leader must come. “Here he is!” said
someone in excited tones. “Here he is!” We
looked, and saw that someone had blundered.
Afterwards we found it was Corso, the tailor,
who had failed in his trust —he hadn’t fin-
ished the Chief Disciple’s costume. Rather
than break his promise, rather than postpone
the revival for another Sunday, which might
be.wet, the Chief Disciple had come costumed
in a simple loincloth improvised from a bed-
sheet.
As soon as he came up to the group we
surrounded him. The lava-lava’s fastening
was a huge safety-pin—a regular grandfather
of safety-pins, the biggest I have ever seen.
But still there Avas a danger of it collapsing
at any moment. We knew' that if it went
with it would go also the Chief Disciple’s
dignity and poise, and all the glory of the
revival as well.
Arrangements were quickly made for a
bodyguard, and those of us who had to speak
at the Memorial Meeting hurried away. I
have had buckets of experience, and while
I can keep young may reasonably expect
plenty more; but no matter what new sen-
sations occur, I don’t think they are likely
to erase the memory of the Chidley Memorial
Meeting on that sunny Sunday. Thousands
had assembled to attend it, and, besides, the
Domain was full of the usual crowd of pro-
phets, preachers, fools and cynics.
The proceedings were quite ordinary until
I got up to speak. The first few sentences
were hardly out of my mouth before a terrific
uproar began. There was a tumult of cheer-
ing, laughing, howling abuse and a variety
of uncouth cries that cannot be named or
described. I almost guessed what it was be -
fore I could see for myself. The Chief Dis-
ciple, attended by his faithful bodyguard, had
arrived at the meeting!
The police were aghast. They had put
Chidley into the lunatic asylum, and to all
intents and purposes he was dead and buried.
Yet “Chidley’s ghost!” the superstitious
whisper passed from lip to lip. “I
told you he was too clever for the ’eads,”
yelled one little man Avith a fiery-red mous-
tache, dancing first on one leg, then on the
other. “They couldn’t kill him. I knew.”
“Standing room only!” yelled someone. All
the other meetings promptly collapsed for
want of a quorum. Ours became the star
attraction of the afternoon.
Through the crush the bodyguard stood
loyally by the Chief Disciple. Looking down
from the platform I could see their bare
heads close together as they stood shoulder
to shoulder like a Roman Emperor’s guard,
swaying like corks in the tide of excited
humanity. It had been decided that, as a
sort of badge, we should all leave our hats
at home. As it turned out this was rather
unfortunate. The absence of headgear in-
stantly proclaimed us; and the crowd started
to bait the bodyguard. One big lout poked a
face and his hand at Darky. You wouldn’t
have thought it. but Darky was a first-class
rough-and-tumble fighter, and inclined to be
sensitive on the subject of his unusual beliefs
and fidelity. On the instant he resigned his
position on the Chief Disciple’s bodyguard
pro tern, and went into action on his own
behalf. Thus the riot started. The old
Domain crowd always went home dis-
appointed if there was no riot. Even in
these comparatively peaceful days, promise
it some excitement and stoush, and in its
heart the crowd will admire you —sometimes
even believe in your message. It matters
little whether the Union .Tack or the Red
Flag drapes your shoulders when you march
away across the green grass. If you have
satisfied the crowd’s lust for sensation, if
you have pandered to its appetite for blood
-—anyone’s blood; even a little will do—
you’re all right.
But if you get into one of those scrimmages,
above all don’t forget the old women. The
Madame Defarges and the terrible sisters of
Sydney go to the Domain; but instead of
knitting-needles they carry umbrellas. A
forest of umbrellas uoav waved around the
Chief Disciple like trees in a gale. Why the
old women wanted to skewer the Chief Dis-
ciple still remains a mystery, but they had
evidently made up their minds to do it.
Somehow the bodyguard gouged a A\ r ay
through the crowd, and passed the Chief
Disciple up on the platform. He faced the
multitude and opend his mouth to speak.
Did a great hush fall over the ns
he delivered his burning message? Did the
mob, that had been raging a minute before,
subside and hang rapt on the silver-tongued
orator’s Avords?
It did not. This is a true story; and,
besides, the Chief Disciple, after the first
few Avords. stood transfixed with nervousness.
Whatever he said Avas lost in the uproar. The
croAvd didn't knoAV what the show Avas in
aid of. “What’s it all about?” several asked.
In doubt the Domain crowd simply roars —
and riots, if opportunity is But
when some genius in our ranks cried “Chid-
ley’s dead ! Long live the new Chidley!”
the crowd began to get the hang of things
and cheered a little.
“Safety first!” yelled a brazen voice whose
owner had evidently observed the giant
pin that held the Chief Disciple’s repu-
tation together. The laugh that went up
to the sky was so thunderous that it must
have upset the equilibrium of the weather,
for out of a clear sky the rain began to fall
in big drops. Our audience went for shelter
under the trees. After that, the deluge.
The rain fell in sheets: it fell and fell and
fell. The Chief Disciple shivered violently,
so one of the bodyguard Avent into the crowd
and got a raincoat. Whether he borrowed
it or took it forcibly I can’t say. All I knoAV
is that he returned with it and w_e attempted
to cover the nakedness of the Chief Disciple.
But the Chief Disciple refused to be pro-
tected from the weather. As Ajax defied the
lightning, so the Chief Disciple stood and
defied the elements.
The water rose round our platform. Hud-
dled together on the narroxv planks like ship-
wrecked sailors marooned on a raft, soaked
and bedraggled, Ave must have looked a sorry
crew of reformers. But many Avaters cannot
quench the spirit of Youth ; and the body-
guard of younger men, counting the scars or
combat, enjoyed the respite the rain afforded.
A fortnight afterwards, when the Chiet
Disciple arose from his bed and recovered
interest enough in life to ask for some cough
mixture, I called to inquire when the next
memorial meeting was to be held. Never
have I heard a man blaspheme so sulphu-
rously.

SOME FRIVOLOUS VERSE.
Spring Night.
TIIE stars that looked on ancient Greece
when Cupid was a boy,
That lit the pearls on Helen’s breast
beside the walls of Troy,
Those same old stars, beloved, they look down
on you and me,
Despite the fact that this is nineteen twenty-
four A.D.
The park is very modern, and the seat is
very new,
But the night-sky over Israel was not than
this more blue.
And, though among the flowers where Omar
would have seen
An empty glass turned down our neighbors
throw a dead marine,
The white moon in her beauty is as lovely
now as when
Old Khayyam and his loved one sought to
fly the world of men.
And the black, star-spangled sea whose rollers
beat along the sand.
When the Ark alone surveyed it, was its
loneliness more grand?
There’s a two-up school in progress over
yonder on the hill
Where a centaur might have galloped when
the world was younger still;
But though two-up’s not romantic —and
that’s readily confessed —
Your lips are just as red as those the cen-
taur might have pressed.
Ah, dearest, through the centuries that dim
behind us lie,
Were there ever two who loved with such a
love as you and I?
It's been said before, I know it, but I’ll swear
it till I die—
There were never two —will ne’er be two —to
love like you and I!

SYDNEY GORDON.
The Brucedale Scandal.
HIMSELF and me put in the trap
And dandered into town,
And there we found a whirligig,
A circus and a clown.
Wo took a ticket for the two
Without a thought of shame,
And never knew till avc got home
The loss of our good name.
’Twas Mrs. Dinny met us first.
Says she., “What’s this I hear?
Ye’re gaddin’ round like young gossoons
Instid of sixty year”:
Says she, “I heard a shockin' thing
About a horse ye rid!”....
Says I, “The Divvle take your ears—•
I don’t care if ye did !”
Says she. “I’ve had respect for you,
I’ve held ye up to all ;
And now my heart is broke in two
For thin kin’ of your fall.”
Says she. “I never thought to find
The frivolous in y0u”....
Says I, for I was fendin' warm,
“I don’t care if ye do!”
We turned and left her where she stood,
A poor astonished thing,
Whose wildest dissipation was
A sober Highland Fling;
But when we came to Kelly's gate
We got another knock.
For there was John O’Brien’s Joe
Who looked his naked shock.
Says he (to Dan he whispers it).
“They say,” says he, “they say”
“Be damned to what they say!” says Dan.
Says I, “Do asses bray?”
The poor misfortune looked at me
As if he thought me daft:
But me, I looked him eye for eye
Until he felt a draught.
The next was Mrs. Tracey’s Mick,
Says he. “I’m hearin’ things!”
Says I. “We’d never need to ride
If gossipin’ was wings!”
Says he, “There’s decency, you know;
Yon mustn’t go too far;
I’m that rfmeh_shocked” “Tut, tut!”
says I;
“I don’t care if ye are!”
But dear old Gran. O’Shaughnessy,
She met us at the door;
Says she, “Since first I heard the news
My foot’s wore out the floor.”
Says she, “I never laughed so much
in all me wildest days,
As when I heard that you an’ Dan
Was took to shameless Avays.”
Says she, “I’m kcepin’ up the fire
Through all this blessed day,
Me Avan eye on the kittle, an’
Me other up the way;
An’ when I heard ye on the road,
An’ thought of what ye’d done,
I felt me longest days slip off
For thinkin’ of your fun !”
“Sure, then,” says I. “it’s not myself
That would begrudge the tale,
For jokes, like butter on the shelf,
If left too long grow stale.”
I told her how I rid the horse
On that there jig-ma-gee,
And when I said how i fell off.
“A-av-w, did ye now!” says she.
I told her of the circus clown,
The things he said and did.
Says she, “He wasn’t half the fun
Of that there horse ye rid;
An’ though me bones is eighty-six,
I wisht I Aims wi’ ye!”
Says I, “Myself I wisht it too!”
“I bet ye did!” says she.
“Aw, girl,” says she. “ye’ve had your day,
If Brucedale has the talk;
Ye’ve ate the apple to the core.
So let them chevv the stalk!”
They chewed the stalk from Rapley’s gate
To Cartwright’s on the hill—
“Bedad,” says Dan. “though years is gone
There’s some that’s cheAvin’ still!”

First Aid.
I ’M reading a marvellous book.
No wonder it's been all the rage.
There’s a double-dyed crook
With villainous look.
And a crime-and-a-half to the page,
And a hero so noble and pure,
The finest that ever was penned,
So hemmed and beset with enticement and
lure,
That the awful suspense I could never en-
dure,
So I’ve just had a peep at the end.
You know those emotional parts,
When your heart’s beating up in your
throat,
When the villain with arts
Estranges two hearts
And comes o’er his treason to gloat;
When you fear that the wretch will succeed,
Cause trouble no author can mend,
When the heroine’s grief makes your very
heart bleed,
You’ll find it great balm in such crises to
read
A little bit right at the end.

Little Bo-Peep: A Bush Version.
OH, Little 80-Peep is young and slim:
Her breasts are round and her ankles
trim;
With saucy eyes, in a low-cut gown.
She watches the roadway up and down —
A shepherdess keen who keeps alway
A careful count of the sheep that stray.
They come in buggies or motor-bikes,
Some come in their cars —which 80-Peep
likes —
And some on horseback, some on their feet,
But each and all in a hope to meet
That special smile from Little 80-Peep
Which wins the coin of the strayed black
sheep.
For ’tis “Bar ! Bar! Bar !” her lambkins
cry,
Who wish “Hood day’’ and who wait “Good-
bye” ;
But our Little 80-Peep she keeps her head,
And sells them tucker and booze and bed ;
Then sees them off on their long bush miles
With downcast lashes and (sometimes) smiles.
Now, Little 80-Peep perchance you’ll see
Is wearing a garter below her knee;
The color’s black; ’tis a sombre hue,
But what is this poor 80-Peep to do
Save mourn a lover who in his head
lias placed a pellet of fatal lead?
They buried him by the river-side; _
Little 80-Peep she cried and she cried
From Friday night till Saturday noon ;
And then she rode ’neath the silver moon
With young Jack Lamb on his gelding gay
Along the river and far away!
Little 80-Peep on her neck so white
Wears a locket with diamonds bright;
Just open the trinket, if you can,
You’ll see the face of a married man !
For Little 80-Peep, despite her years,
Is most adept with the sheep she shears.
It makes her scornful, it makes her sad,
To learn the gossips have called her “bad”;
Her cheeks so soft and her eyes so kind,
’Tis just the manner of womankind
To utter their scandals on the sly—
She vows that she would not hurt a fly.
Little 80-Peep (to toll it gives pain)
Is fond of a drink they call champagne—
A pound a pint and you take your chance
If it comes from Footscra.v or from France;
When you pour it out, this costly wine,
It winks and bubbles and sparkles fine.
And little 80-Peep will drink with you
A pleasant bottle or even two,
Just to show in a friendship gay
There is no ill-feeling either way;
When thus you’ve broken the social ice
You’ll find your Little 80-Peep quite nice,
Her hand, perhaps, she will let you press,
Grant even a kiss or small caress;
She’ll let you bask in her Bacchic joy—
Until your money is spent, my boy!
But if your hobby be humble beer,
There’s little doing and less to fear.
This Little 80-Peep won’t lose her sheep,
She knows just where to find ’em ;
Let her alone and they’ll go home.
And leave their cash behind ’em.
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NOW do I fare as a ship fares,
With a pale brow to the fading
thunder,
In the hushed wake of the crazed aiis,
Wide sky over, and deepness under;
Near the new gleam of the blue ways
Fretted by feet of the breeze’s walking,
With a white step from the strange days
And the soft gossip of small waves talking.
I have touched hands to the sea’s face,
Joyed at smile-waking and frown-fading,
Seen the green gleam in a blue place
With a tall day through the waves wading;
Marked the far flash of a gull, high
Like a wild word in the silence flying
Down a flat sea from a domed sky,
To a loud bay and the great waves dying.
In the mind’s quest of the fled gale
Wakes a new wonder for the heart’s hold-
ing—
A deep song from a gold sail,
Scrolled clouds and their shadowy un-
folding,
Racked caves voicing the sea’s soul,
The land’s .‘ •ms and the waves’ white
fawning,
And the far sheen where tin- swift shoal
Glimmers and fades like a drowned
dawning.
As a drawn bow of brass, taut,
The day is arched with a bright bending,
And the straight sea is held, caught
Round the slim eve and the dawn’s thin
ending;
Over the spray blown and spume spun,
Whispers a cadence as of strings singing;
Over the dumb clouds and the mute sun
Speeds the swift fancy’s arrowy out-
winging.
Amber and clear the hours stand
Poised above the level water’s laving,
Like a strange light by a dim land,
A wide flame between the seasons waving,
A gleaming veil over the sea’s grace;
While ’neath the great leagues of silvern
shining
Wreathe the warm currents from a far place,
Like broad green cables slowly inter-
twining.
Where the sea’s edge meets the blue steep
Rolls a new white wind with sweet un-
winding.
While the gaunt days and the gales sleep
Past all remembering or new finding;
And, as a bugle on a high hill,
Chimes the near sun-wave, cresting, tower-
ing,
To drench the year’s heart and spill
The fairer foam-flowers round a world
flowering.

The Nurse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the cemetery at La Perouse, hard by
the shores of beautiful Botany Bay,
lies a cracked tombstone, made of hard
rock that might have come from somewhere
near the Pyrmont quarries—a tombstone
which for many years decorated a grave in
the Sandhills, better known to the present
generation of old and middle-aged Sydney
as the Devonshire-street Cemetery. It was
moved out there when a notice of ejectment
on behalf of the Railway Commissioners
was served upon many old bones in the
interests of the about-to-be-erected Central
Railway Station.
The inscription upon this large, flat slab,
its deep-cut letters still very legible and dis-
tinct, is as follows :
SACRED TO
THE MEMORY OF
MRS. ELIZABETH MULTITUDE,
Obit March ye 25th, 1824.
Affliction soare long time she bore,
Physitians was in vaine;
Till God thoughte beste to give her reste,
And Ease her of Her paine.
AGED 76 YRS.
Pause, Stranger, and contemplate with respecte
ye Resting Place of One who, in a long and use-
ful Career, exemplified by her Piety, Industry,
and Charity the manifold Virtues of her Sex.
For Fourty Yeares she tended ye Sicke with de-
votion and Skille, alleviated ye Bodily paines
of Many, and sooth’d ye Dying Moments of not
a Few. This Settlement is ye poorer for her
Losse —ye Heavenly Kingdom ye richer. Goe
thou, and doe Likewise.
SIC SEMPER TYRRANNIS.
Why the amazing Latin tag appears at the
bottom is only to be explained, possibly, by
supposing that the tombstone-maker threw it
in for good measure. He may have sup-
posed, from the sound of the words, that
they had something to do with the Tyranny
of Sickness.
* * -:t *•
Surgeon Arthur Bowes, medical officer of
the female convict transport Lady Penrhyn
—the ship which carried from Britain the
larger number of the ladies who consti-
tuted the original “society” of British Aus-
tralasia —found himself in something of a
quandary as the First Fleet made its east-
ing from the Cape of Good Hope towards
the southern end of Van Diemen’s Land.
On a sunny Sunday morning at the end of
November, 1787, he walked up and down
the weather side of the heaving poop of his
ship, a prey to such anxious reflections as to
attract the attention of Captain Campbell,
the senior military officer on board. As he
came up the ladder from the quarter-deck, the
latter hailed the surgeon playfully, and rallied
him upon his serious demeanour.
“Ahoy, there, Doctor —to adopt the lan-
guage of our nautical shipmates—in the
name of Heaven, what’s the matter? I de-
clare you look as though you might have
seen the Flying Dutchman! Are your. fair
charges misbehaving themselves? Or is it
merely indigestion?”
Dr. Bowes paused in liis walk, and came
slowly for’ard to meet the marine officer.
He shook his head and smiled; but his eyes
held little of the quality of mirth.
“Ah no, sir. They are no worse than
usual, and my digestion is as good as salt-
horse permits of. ’Tis another matter that
troubles me. I confess it troubles me very
greatly to come to a decision as to a certain
affair of some importance.”
“Well, then, what's the worry? Perhaps
I might be permitted to share it with you?
Two backs may bear a burden better than
one, you know. Will you not confide it to
me?”
The doctor did not immediately reply, but
stood staring over the rail at the fizzing,
creaming water rushing aft under the ship s
counter, as though seeking inspiration from
the beginnings of the foaming wake. Pres-
ently lie lifted his eyes to Captain Camp-
bell’s, and, with a gesture of weariness and
a sigh, unburdened himself of his trouble.
“Do you remember that old woman, Matty
Horrocks —the vetei an of our little com-
munity—Captain Campbell? She is seventy-
three.”
“Oh yes. of cours'. Why the Govern-
ment should put itseli to the expense of send-
ing such an aged wor an over sea hath ever
been a pu:m l ement to me. ’Tis as though
the autlim-L. - merely wished to cheat her
out of a grave in tier native land. What of
her, Doctor?”
"She is very ill, and nothing but most
devoted nursing can possibly pull her
through. I have her, of course, in our little
hospital; but she needs constant and unre-
mitting attention, which it is not easy to
give to her. Else she will die.”
Captain Campbell shrugged his broad
shoulders. “But why permit the fact to
trouble you, my dear Bowes? Surely a
month or two more of life makes little differ-
ence to the poor old body. Indeed, it might
be a true mercy for her to be spared the
privations and fatigues inevitable to the
establishment of a settlement at Botany Bay.
A grave here, in the Southern Ocean, would
probably be as comfortable as one on the
shores of an unknown and savage continent.”
Dr. Bowes looked a little hurt. He made j
a deprecatory movement of the hand. “Ah
well, maybe so. Very possibly. But ’tis
not the wont of my profession to consider
such matters thus. ’Tis my duty to save her,
if it be possible. Moreover, I have looked
forward to landing all my patients alive and
in good health. ’Twill set a precedent for
the treatment of future cargoes of humanity
that may be shipped to New South Wales. I
do not want to lose old Matty, but I don’t
see how I can hope to keep her without good
nursing. And where am I to get it I know
not.”
Suddenly Captain Campbell s face lit up.
as though with some happy inspiration calcu-
lated to solve the surgeon’s difficulty.
“I have it!” lie cried. “In the list of
prisoners there is one —a lifer —whose occu-
NOT FINISHED THE JOB.
CIAUD: “Quick, Auntie Jane! Lanky
Peter's keen an ’ hanged hissclf down at
the camp!”
AUNTIE JANE: “Oh, my goodness! Where
is he? Didger cut ’im down? Didger

CLAUD: “N-n-no, Auntie. ’E wasn’t quite
dead!”
pation is given as that of a nurse. Why not
try her, my good doctor? She’ll surely have
the requisite experience.”
Dr. Bowes smiled ruefully.
“Yes, I know. Elizabeth Multitude. Do
you remember how her crime is described in
the list?”
“Well, no —I can’t say I do,”
“ ’Tis ‘murder.’ ”
“Well, what of that? I take it that mur-
der is not so much a habit as an accident.
Mrs. Multitude, no doubt, having taken life
in one instance, would be all the better dis-
posed towards preserving it in others. And
she seems to be a bright, intelligent woman—
far above most of her companions in educa-
tion. She should suit your requirements per-
fectly.”
The Doctor shook his head. “That woman,
I think, Mr. Campbell, is a sort of devil —
as unnatural and perverted from right and
wholesome ways of thought as it is possible
for one of God’s creatures to be, on this side
of the line dividing reason from dementia.
She is a poisoner of the worst description.
What do you think? She killed not only her
husband, but her two innocent babes likewise.
With arsenic. Oh, dreadful! And I have
myself heard her revile old Mrs. Horrocks in
the most unseemly fashion. Called her an old
dotard, and said that, for her part, if she
had anything to do with such an old nuisance,
she’d think nothing of putting her out of
the way as a saving of trouble. I believe
she would, too, without the slightest feeling
of compunction. How could I set her to
look after the poor old creature —being aware
of such a sentiment as that, and knowing her
history?”
“Lord above, you astound me, Bowes!
Why, I declare I’ve regarded that woman’s
face, and found something positively noble in
it. How comes it that she escaped Jack
Ketch ?”
“Oh, our liege lord to be, the noble Prince
of Wales, happening to divert himself by
attending at the Old Bailey oil the occasion

of her trial —you know the predilection of
his Royal Highness for a handsome woman—
was graciously pleased to interest himself in
her; and, although sentence of death was
inevitable, he saw to it afterwards that she
did not suffer as she merited. My brother
Tom —he’s a barrister, you know —heard him
remark at the Sheriff’s dinner-table : ‘Oh gad,
she's too pretty to be scragged. We’ll send
her to breed at Botany Bay ! They’ll find
her useful there, no doubt.’ So here she is
—pregnant with mischief as any Messalina,
and about as moral. I fear that woman.
I'd not trust her to nurse a sick monkey, lest
her devilish nature might prompt her to make
away with it. for very pastime, and to keep
in practice. Yet were she to be trusted she’d
be a godsend to me now. She has the nursing
faculty as few women have it.”
Captain Campbell pondered for a few
moments, his eyes roving over the infinity of
sparkling sunlit blue waters stretching to
the horizon. Presently he swore softly, and
turned again to the surgeon.
“D—n the woman! I’m in command here,
and will stand none of her nonsense. Is not
that her standing by the mainmast? Go sum-
mon her to the Great Cabin, Doctor. We’ll
see whether Mistress Multitude cannot be
prevailed upon to act reasonably. There are
ways of dealing with such ladies—and I
think I know of one of them. Yes, bring her
aft immediately.”
Presently Mrs. Multitude, a fine-looking
woman of forty, with a magnificent head of
reddish-golden hair surmounting a counte-
nance that, as Captain Campbell had said,
bore some suggestion of nobility in its regu-
lar features, stood before the latter officer
beneath the low oak beams of the Great
Cabin, as he sat at the end of the dining-
table. Dr. Bowes, nervous and serious,
stood behind her in the doorway.
“Now, lookye, prisoner Multitude,” said
Captain. Campbell sternly, “you’re to go a-
mirsiug in the hospital—to attend upon,
under the surgeon’s direction, that old woman,
Betsy Horrocks, who is very ill. Now, I
speak plainly to you, my good woman. I
know your crime and your character. If
Mrs. Horrocks dies, I will punish, you. I’ll
cut your hair off! If you save her, I’ll
recommend you to the Principal Surgeon of
the expedition. Dr. White, for a post in the
hospital that will be established on shore
when we disembark at Botany Bay. Go to
your duties —and, by God, ye’d do well to
attend to them! But, mind ye, Mrs. Hor-
rocks is to land in good health.”
Demurely Mrs. Multitude dropped him a
curtsey. “I thank your honor,” she said, in
a refined and musical voice, “I’ll do my
utmost for the poor creature. ’
Sydney Hospital in 17S8 was a quaint
asylum for the ill and the infirm. In the
crude drawing which Captain Hunter made
of Sydney Cove and the little settlement scat-
tered about its head in August of that year,
it is shown as a cluster of primitive buildings
and tents standing a little way back from
the western shore, three-quarters of the dis-
tance up the Cove from its mouth. Great
trees overshadow the huts. The hillside of
the Rocks lies behind it. But it is well
away from the rest of the encampment that
was Sydney in the first year of British settle-
ment in Australia, and its situation was at
least a very charming one. In front sparkled
the blue waters of the little indentation in the
wooded shoreline of the harbor, and down
beyond the point named after Lieutenant
Dawes of the Marines, across the gleaming
silver of the main channel, rose the dense
forests that clad the heights of the northern
shore of Port Jackson. Up the valley, amid
the tall timber growing beside the course of
the Tank Stream, all day long sounded the
noise of axe and mattock, whilst the grey
smoke of cooking-fires curled upward in thin
spirals, to be lost against the blueness of the
clear southern sky. At night lights twinkled
between the trees, and distant voices broke
the stillness that had lasted there from the
making of the world.
An earthenware
plaque on a police-
station, affixed by
the Historical
Society, marks now
the site of the main
ward—immediately
opposite the old
building erected by
Governor Mac-
quarie twenty-four
years later for the
accommodation of
the Commissary-
General and his
staff. But nothing
remains of the
scene save the blue
waters of Sydney
Cove. There may
be a ghost or two
there after George-
street lias gone to
bed in the hours
aft e r midnight.
Surgeon White, in
one of his monthly
reports to Gover-
nor Phillip, takes
occasion to praise,
in no stinted terms,
the Head Nurse, or
Matr o n, as we
should call her now,
of his primitive in-
firmary. “It affords
me much satisfac-
tion,” he says, “to
bring beneat h
the notice of
yo u r Excellency
the uniform good-conduct, assiduous industry,
and painstaking particularity of the woman
who was put in charge of the General Hospi-
tal at the recommendation of Surgeon Bowes,
of the Lady Pehrhyn. It is largely due to
her indefatigable labors, skill and aptitude for
nursing that the returns of mortality in the
Settlement present so satisfactory an aspect.
She has been of inestimable assistance to me
in supervising the general health of the com-
munity, and should your Excellency be dis-
posed tp consider her worthy of an exercise
of that clemency with which it has been your
wont to reward conspicuous merit amongst
the prisoners, I am confident that Mrs. Eliza-
beth Multitude would be a fit object for such
indulgence.”
So it came about that Betsy Multitude,
instinctive and congenital murderess, by the
exercise of her great abilities in dissimulation
acquired that virtuous reputation which may
be read in the graveyard at La Perouse.
On a bleak, wet night at the beginning of
the first springtime enjoyed by white men and
women in Australia, Mrs. Multitude, sewing
by candlelight in the little hut with a
thatched roof that had been, assigned to her
behind the hospital, at the foot of the Rocks,
heard the sentry on the track that led to the
main encampment up the Cove, challenge
loudly.
“Halt! Who goes there?”
She put down her work, and listened.
“’Tis a sick woman from th’ lines. Th’
doctor sent her over —for to be put to bed
WORTH IT.
“I’ve been rescued four times this season.”
“Gracious! It must be dreadful to be carried out.”
“Yes, but it’s perfectly thrilling to be carried in.”
i’ th’ orspittle. Slie’m main bad. I’m
tliinkin’. Chokin’ for breff she be. Will ’ce
pass th’ w r ord, sentry, for Mistress Multi-
tood ?”
She heard the sentry shout for the corporal
of the guard, and, taking down a horn lan-
tern from a peg in the slab wall of her apart-
ment, busied herself with flint and steel, lit
it, threw a blanket about her shoulders, and
went to see to the admission of this new
patient. A howling southerly gale swirled
down the valley, and her light blew out. She
did not trouble to rekindle it, but groped her
w T ay through the thick darkness towards the
sentry’s post.
Here she came upon three men, who stooped
above a rude statelier, on which was dimly
to be made out, in the flickering illumination
of a half-extinguished lire that marked the
position of the sentry, a huddled little figure
that occasionally squirmed, and moaned with
plaintive irregularity.
“What’s the matter?” she asked the men.
“Aw, Gawd bless ’ee, Mistress Multitood,
she be werry bad. Took suddent-like she
were—a liower agone. Dr. White he’s sent
her over to you, wi’s complyments, an’ wants
her well looked after. But ’e needn’t ha said
that —we uns knows how well ye. takes care
o’ hall of ’em wot comes ’ere- Gawd knows
wot’d become o’ we poor pris’ners ef ’tweren’t
for you, Mistress Multitood.”
“Oh, stop your silly chatter, Bill Holmes.
Bring her along. I’ll put her in the little
hut by herself. She seems to be pretty bad.
Pick her up and follow me. Who is she—
d’ye know?”
“ ’Tis old Matty ’Orrocks.”
“Ah!”
Mr. Holmes, the pickpocket, was nimbler
with his fingers than his wits, or he might
have noted that the apparent careless casual-
ness of the head nurse’s exclamation was not
really so. There was something in the inflec-
tion of the voice that might have meant a
good deal to any others than that dull dog Bill
Holmes and his equally obtuse companions.
They carried their light burden to the door
of the hut, which stood in a line with Betsy's
own residence, and naused at the threshold,
whilst she kindled her lantern within.
“Shut the door after you —no, I’ve got
no rum for ye,” she said to iem, when they
had deposited the patient on the earthen
floor.
Grumblingly they went out into the rainy
darkness. Mrs. Multitude lifted the dim lan-
tern, and held it above the features —deathly
white—of the little old woman on the
stretcher. Her own fine face, in which Cap-
tain Campbell had fancied that he could de-
tect some indication of nobility of nature,
underwent an appalling change. It became
convulsed with a malevolence that was hardly
human. She spat at the stricken creature
at her feet.
“Now, ye old . I’ve got ye. Ye’re
dying, d’ye hear me? But ye’ll die my way
—not your own. Wait till I get ye a dose!”
“The poor old dear,” said Mrs. Multitude
to the Principal Surgeon in the morning—
“she died about 2 o’clock. Oh, quite peace-
fully, Doctor. I prayed with her until the
end. She was most grateful, and so devout.
’Twas a blessed tiling to be present at such
a passing. She’s in the dead-house. Do you
wish to see her, Doctor?”
“Oh, no! No time this morning. I’m
going botanising over to Sirius Cove. I’m
sure you did your best for her, Mrs. Multi-
tude. You are our greatest blessing!”
“Oh, Doctor, you flatter me. I only do my
best. ’Tis uod’s work.”
“God bless you, Mrs. Multitude, for a good
woman.”
But had Surgeon White poked his head into
the dead-house that morning it is quite cer-

The F. A. Sargoods’ party at Tudor was
the affair of last Aveek. It was their formal
leave-taking before the jaunt that is to in-
clude Africa as well as Europe. Nearly
300 of the city’s social heavyweights walked
about the pleasant old Elizabeth Bay garden.
Army, Navy, mere people and Fairfaxes
all consumed ices and cool drinks in the
truly Christmas spirit of peace on earth and
after death a good obituary notice. The
hostess clothed her slimness in soft <black,
and turned her unhatted hair to the breeze.
A guest of importance was Mrs. Sargood’s
niece, Helen Morris, xvlio starts on the jour-
ney with Mr. and Mrs. Sargood, but travels
straight on to England, where Lieut.-Com-
mander Gilbertson, R.N., waits her coming.
The ever-moving home of the Permanents
will begin to heave in January. Colonel
Sturdee, with a string of war decorations—
lie was a Gallipoli man—leaves the instruc-
tional staff at Duntroon to join headquarters
in Melbourne. The youthful-looking Colonel
Laverack. a Queenslander, who brought back
from the Great Upheaval a kit full of simi-
lar decorations and a reputation for brilliant
leadership, goes on to Melbourne from our
own Victoria Barracks.
Commander Wardle is now the complete
father. Daughter Jean arrived from Eng-
land last Friday.
The first couple to enter the estate of
matrimony through the portals of St. Augus-
tine’s, at Neutral Bay. were Jeannette Keene,
of Moree, and Errol Campbell, of Randwick.
A froth of white georgette and lace Wrapped
the bride, and trailed away into a long mist
of train, on which roses bloomed goldenly.
Noel Keene and Edith Bulkeley ’maided in
harmonies of apple-green and burnt-orange
frocking. Ronald Campbell stood by the
’groom. He is an ex-soldier who enlisted in
1915. Before that he was on the land, but
a war-injured leg lias forced him into a sta-
tion-supplies business in the city.
Of all Sydney churches St. Mark’s, at
Darling Point, is pre-eminently suited for
a summer afternoon’s wedding. The church
itself is at once picturesque and impressive,
and it throws a curving arm of pathway be-
tAveen itself and the unsanctified highway.
Up this, on a day of last Aveek made up
of blue sky and golden sun, Lesley Reading
walked on father’s arm, in a sparkle of silver
tissue misted over with a cascading lace veil,
whose time-mellowed folds Avere moored to
the pretty head by a spray of orange blos-
som, Avhile an armful of pink gladioli and
blue delphiniums Avas the final touch. To
make the picture more ravishing, Janet Har-
vey, Marjorie Sutherland (Melbourne),
Loraine Catterall and Helen Stephen, like
a flock of lioney-hued birds, in georgette
frocking, on which a jungle of ostrich-feather
fringe swished and fluttered, followed the de-
mure principal lady. The matrimonial
assignee, Noel Heath (Melbourne), duly
took possession of the lady in a church
turned into a boAver of white lilies. Padre
Howard Lea blessed the transfer, which Avas
fully choral. Geoff Heath best-manned, and
there were three groomsmen to balance up
with the ’maids. A marquee on the lawn
of Yo Merry, the bride’s home, housed the
wedding meats; the bride’s mother did the
big handshake supported by gorgeous rai-
ment of biscuit lace over broAvn satin.
Science-master E. M. Bagot, of “Shore”
Grammar, linked up quietly last Saturday
night Avitli Dorothy Lane, of Warren. The
school chapel Avas the starting-point of the
experiment in matrimony, and Padre Davies,
who has been at “Shore” since its founda-
tion, blessed the venture. The bride is a
good-looker, slimly Junoesque, and it seemed
a pity that there Avas nobody but relatives,
the headmaster Robson couple and a few
other educational searchlights to see how
Avell she looked in her Bridal finery. The
’groom belongs to a large S. Australian clan
which has Been mostly concerned hitherto
Avith stock-raising and wool-selling.
Last week Sydney Society xvas thrilled
by the news of the “Twinny” Macarthurs’
engagement and Avedding. First came news
of Phyl’s engagement to Henry Osborne (and
that’s the culmination of a romance that was
nearly a Avedding 12 years ago) ; on top of
that the cables got busy with sister Ruth’s
wedding to Samuel Hardy, Master of Hamble-
don Foxhounds. Ruth Avent to England
some time ago to join her friend, Mrs. Lebby
Hordern, and Pliyl for a while did social
notes on a Sydney magazine. Both of them
benefited under the will of their life-long
friend Toby Watt. Aunt Miss Brown,
of Double Bay, whose home was the popu-
lar girls’ headquarters when they weren’t
on a round of house-parties, goes to London
for the second wedding.
Linda Wallis, of Bondi, has ticked off the
second-last day of the year for her double-
harnessing with E. George Marks.
Linda, the youngest of the Mocatta sisters,
has given up a career for matrimony. She
(mters on the great adventure on the 20th
with Roy Arnold. There’s lots of brains in
the family—father is a Government sur-
veyor, uncle is a Judge, and one sister, Millie,
is a doctor who not long ago hung out her
brass-plate in Adelaide. Another sister,
Brenda, is learning to be a conveyancer, and
fills her spare moments by writing articles on
psychology.
Celebrate Christmas Week by buying and
trying a Mirror. Next Tuesday's number
contains six short stories by well-known Aus-
tralian writers, verse by Mary Gilmore, Rod.
Quinn, Louis Esson and a group of equally
sweet songbirds. “Gouger” tells the heart-
melting story of the tragic last voyage of
Mrs. Watson, the heroine of the Cape York
Peninsula. Fashions for the bride, the girl
who wants to be a bride, and the baby smile
winningly from the pages ; the picnic girl will
find a page of recipes for delicious sandwich-
fillings ; the domestic girl will learn how to
care for her hands; and mother will hear
details of how to keep baby happy through
the weaning. There are 64 pages for three-
pence.
The Daleroze Society took possession of
the Rendezvous, the restaurant tucked in-
side Hosking-place, the other night, and bade
Mary Whidborne’s successors, Phyllis Craw-
hall and Katherine Haynes, welcome to our
continent. The society, judging from the
roll-up, must be a womanly affair, for about
six dinner-jackets shone conspicuously in their
minority among rows and rows of women,
whose clothes looked mostly as if it had been
decided that “second-best” was good enough.
This doesn’t apply to Mary Whidborne, of
course. As Official Receiver that slim young
woman wore a turn-out that held the blue-
greens of sea-water in its shimmer, and
looked as though built to support the adage,
“Never put on to-day what you can leave
off to-morrow.” Furthermore, her bobbed
hair was curled up in a new Frenchy fashion;
and altogether on her sartorial swan song
Mary can be complimented. Mr. McMena-
min, president of the society, officially spoke
the newcomers fair, and Miss Crawhall, in
moires the blue of Wedgwood, made a neat
little speech in reply. Katherine Haynes
subdued the flame of her georgettes by a
close spray of crystal beading; and neither
girl had as much as a lick of powder over
the roses Old England had planted in their
cheeks.
May Mitchell is to be the new secretary
of the Crown-street Women’s Hospital in
succession to Mona Daley, who held the job
for nine years and leaves to join the holy
state of matrimony. The new secretary is a
North Shore High old girl, and has for five
years been chief-assistant to Miss Daley.
Herewith pretty Dorothy Rudder, a Syd-
ney soprano, who has sung in everything
from panto-
mine to opera.
Listeners - in
know her bird-
like voice, and
the guests at
Bertie Kelly’s
last concert in
Beale’s studio
predicted a
great future
for this attrac-
tive pupil of
William Beat-
tie. But they
bargained with-
out Cupid. A
few nights
later Dorothy
went to a
party and sud-
denly found
herself face to
face with one
Leon a r d
(“Siam”) Smith, whom she had met a year
or two ago when she was starring with a
concert party in “the East.” Result: an
engagement-ring—matrimony this month.
Mr. Smith is a mining-engineer of Siam, and
the future home will be in the Straits Settle-
ment.
There are 31 fresh young kindergarten
teachers loose in N.S.W., and the bevy, each
in a white frock and bearing an old-fashioned
posy, listened demurely the other night at
St. James’s while Peter Board droned about
that great educational institution, the World.
Then president of the Kindergarten Union
Cohen handed each lass a Training-College
certificate, and Miss Harriet Dumolo, the
high priestess of kindergarten education in
the State, spoke of the new training-college
at Waverley, and pianist Myrtle Meggy
sprayed the night with music.
Muriel Starr’s kettledrum at the Ambas-
sadors in aid of the kindergarten building
fund brought out the theatricals like the sun
brings out the cicadas; and they swung to
the strains of jazz, or kept the ball-bearings
of Monte Luke’s camera running hot while
he clicked them amid adoring admirers. Mrs.
Guy Bates Post (known heretofore as Mrs.
Guy Gate Post) shone like a radiant rose
in blush pink under vellum lace frocking,
topped by a vellum lace hat of vast dimen-
sions : and Marie Burke and Floie Allen,
Roger Barry and Gus Bluett, the Seymour
Hicks family and dashing Marie La Yarre
were a few among the others.
Two leading city business colleges, Stott
and Underwoods and the Metropolitan Busi-
ness College, ended the year with a good
thought for others. On successive nights
they combined their annual prize-distribution
with a concert aimed to bring Christmas joy
to the poor and the sick. Stott and Under-
woods worked for the kiddies’ hospital, while
the Metropolitan Business College flappers
and embryo captains of industry passed on
their takings of nearly £lOO to the Benevo-
lent Society.
At 21 Johnnie Hunter was Associate-Pro-
fessor of Anatomy at the University of Syd-
ney, thus attaining the distinction of being
the youngest professor in the world. Last
wee k, being
then in his
26th year,
Johnnie Hun-
ter died in
London,
whither science
had taken him.
This journey
to England fol-
lowed on a
visit to the
U.S.A., at the
invitation of
the Director-
General of the
American Col-
lege of Sur-
geons, to col-
laborate with
Dr. Royle in
delivering the
John B. Mur-
phy oration
before the
Clinical Congress. Twelve months ago the
two young Sydney men had obtained astound'
ing results in the treatment of paralysis, and
it was in carrying the message of plastic
surgery to the older continents that Johnnie
Hunter, of the wide, laughing mouth and the
piercing eyes, met Death. A Bendigo native,
he grew up in N. S. Wales, his school and
university career being a glittering rosary
of achievement. He seemed to know in-
stinctively those things about the human
body that other men must spend years in
learning. And yet he did not trust to his
uncanny foreknowledge: he worked unceas-
ingly. No more brilliant son had ever been
born to Australia; no more modest young
man ever achieved great things. There is
nation-wide sympathy for his bride —they
were married only a few months ago. She
was Hazel McPherson, of Ashfield.
Cool and fresh on hand-made paper in
brown and vellum binding comes the collected
work of the poet Birtles : “Black Poppies.”
The writer is 24 —just the right age for a
poet—-and his verse is hot and tumultuous
and young, with the warmth and color and
light of Australia in it. To be candid, most
of his songs arc of the flesh, of nymphs and
satyrs and long swooning kisses, so the 135
copies of the edition will speedily be sold out.
As some may remember, Bert Birtles was
expelled from the Sydney Uni. for writing a
poem which was published in Hermes under
the title of “Beauty.” It is reprinted in
the present work. Refusing to have his life
smashed by the Uni. fathers, he got a job in
Tooth’s Brewery. But (lest other poets
may be too envious) it’s on the business, not
the liquid side. He has a girl-wife who is
still a student at the Teachers’ College.
The Apollo Club’s last concert for the year
had two notable features: the introduction
of contralto Morva Davies to Sydney audi-
ences, and the performance of Edgar Mad-
dock’s “Invocation.” Morva proved a charm-
ing bit of girlhood, still in her teens, and of
the quality of her voice there can be no doubt
-—it is rich and full, and suggests in some of
its notes the essence of tears. Mr. Mad-
dock’s work is both graceful and imaginative
—he is a pupil of Alfred Hill, and that
veteran’s baton led the composition to such
effect that the audience demanded a repeti-
tion.
There is talk behind fans these hot days
of Grace Seobie standing again for Parlia-
ment. If she does she will probably contest
Eastern Suburbs, under the Country party
banner. That’s the most suitable, anyway,
for Grace, of the blue eyes, for she is bush-
land born and bred; her fine old dad was
returned on the Labor ticket for Wentworth,
a squatting district, in the days when
Labor had most of its battling yet to do.
The other afternoon, at the headquarters of
the Women’s Country party, Grace gave a
sterling address on “Women in Politics. The
forceful lady’s oratory is of Euclid-like con-
struction. There are no loose ends to her
arguments, no windy flights of eloquence.
Her ideas are constructive; and while not
soul-stirring she is mentally convincing. Dr.
Earle Page’s lady was in the chair, and the
atmosphere was warmed up first by that Mrs.
Finigan who long ago battled for Woman Suf-
frage with Rose Scott. The dear thing
quoted Tom Moore with a brogue as sweet
as the air in the Vale of Avoca; and as she
listened one modern girl couldn’t help think-
ing that women must have played at politics
in those days as if it were a game of croquet.
Now, you may think it futile to weave
ropes of sand, but that’s what Commissioner
Whatmore, of the Salvation Army, is busy
doing these summer mornings. Ropes of
the long shining breeze-swept sands of Col-
laroy, and these silver strands are going to
bind together six days of by-thc-sea happi-
ness for first 100 little girls and next 100
little boys, many of whom have never seen
the ocean. Never to have seen the ocean is
not so difficult when you’re a tiny one and
live in, say, Sophia-street. in Surry Hills.
Sophia street is an oven of bricks and mortar,
and the seaside, even the Harbor-front, is
several pennies distant. January is the
date fixed for the exodus, and perhaps the
officers in charge won't be altogether sur-
prised if one or two strays get in with the
specified hundred. If you like to add your
cheque, it will be welcomed —it will all add
to the joys of the little holiday-makers.
In the drabness of Pyrmont the Outpost
Kindergarten blooms like a rose in the wilder-
ness. As you can guess from its na'me, the
Outpost is a war-time memorial, and its com-
mittee includes a number of Diggers’ wives.
Throughout the year these warm-hearted
women keep their special kiddies’ corner
going with a series of dances and afternoon
parties. One day last week they rattled the
box for the last time in 1924 by summoning
lucky kiddies and happy mothers to a Christ-
mas party at the Wentworth. The takings
from this go to swell the O.lv. treasury for
next year. The jollo was a great success,
and crowds of youngsters gurgled over the
evergreen Punch and Judy, and eyes nearly
popped out trying to see how the conjuring
man did it.
A friend of this Letter's, just back from
staying with crowned heads, says that Queen
Mary has decided on an elegant design of
handcuffs and turnkeys to surround the
words “Stolen from Buckingham Palace,”
with which she is having the house linen
and table implements stamped. With so
many guests anxious to take home souvenirs
of their visit to Royalty, housekeeping is
becoming a problem. Probably what caused
the final decision was the glimpse George
and Mary caught of dear old ladies at the
last Garden Party smilingly uprooting price-
less bulbs.
A P.S. from Brisbane: —
Sir Matthew has been showing himself at the
breaking-up of most of the schools from Southport
t<> Toowoomba. These weighty matters have been
varied by a lunch given at Government House lo
the Caldwells (of Geneva) and a dinner to the
Gordon Grahams, Alice and Dorothy Hawthorne, and
Commander Bennett, of the Geranium. Later in
the week his Ex. went to the Rosalie Kindergarten
and plucked Christmas fruits from the festive tree
for the kiddies. Mrs. Ross Munro sent a Christmas
stocking to each of the little ones at the Paddington
Kindergarten, and the Rotary Club gave a generous
hand to all the branches. Sir Matthew went lo
St. Andrew’s Hall to preside at a distribution of
diplomas to students of the Kindergarten and Train-
ing College. Sir Matthew also went to Jo Richards's
dramatic recital in the Albert Hall, where the gifted
girleen, in gold tissue and rose pink, won laurels
and other vegetable tributes.
At the Elite Theatre, Steele Rudd’s “Grubb’s Selee
tion,” staged under Harry Borradale’s supervision
in aid of the Queensland Authors and Artists’ Associa-
tion, has had a good run. On the opening night
producer and author were obliged to pacify an enthusi-
astic house with speeches.
All Hallows’ display of pupils’ work was quite
up to standard. Many comfy garments for patients
in the Mater Public Hospital were shown, as well as
exquisite Limerick lace, Irish crochet table-centres and
’broidered cushions, Richelieu work and examples of
dressmaking. The younger school brought cane an!
raffia, pastel drawings and plain and fancy needle-
work.
RhOda Pelgate gave her first students’ recital in
the Y.W.C.A. Hall. Jean Trundle, who was among
the crowd, is thinking seriously of the stage as a
career. Those who have seen Rhoda say she should,
too.
Races and big cricket occupied 'Brisbane on
Saturday. A teaparty was given at the Gee-Gees
by Pat O’Shea. Amongst the pretty frocking was
Mrs. Whittingham’s biscuit georgette, with shell-
pink hat. Mrs. Cadell Garrick wore white and
Nankin blue. Irma Dearden was in sand and cherry,
Mrs. Cecil Palmer in lemon tint.
The Farmer home, Redlands, Toowoomba, was all
dressed up for a motor gymkhana to aid the Country
Women’s Association appeal. The Municipal band
played the accompaniment to the tinkling coin.
The Albert Hall held the C. E. Grammar School’s
speech daj r . Archbishop Sharp Avas overlord, and the
Sandford Jacksons, Graham Harts and Tyrwhitts
were among the listeners.

quires NO REFILLS, and
is absolutely inexhaustible.
The “Handilite” is always
in working order, it is easy
to operate, and generates
its own light by a simple
operation of the lever. An
excellent suggestion for a
Xmas Gift.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
“A good actor is a bad speaker.” said Mos-
covitch in liis neat little last-curtain speech
on Saturday night, “so I must be a very good
actor.” The Russian star, who had done
the rival shows between his rehearsals,
patted Australian audiences on the back as
world-beaters in enthusiasm. The scenes for
liis own “Merchant of Venice” were set
beautifully, but one missed the moon-bathed
lawn which framed Jessica and Lorenzo’s
young love in the Oscar Asche version. Jean
Roberts’s elegant attractions fully justified
her lure to a regiment of lovers, though her
scarlet Portia robes trail rather too femi-
ninely in the trial scene; otherwise she
dresses her loveliness in silver overdraped
with panels blue as the sea, and later rose-
pink with inky linings. Juliet caps studded
with jewels snood her brown locks. Nerissa’s
charms are less elaborately frocked in brocade,
the mauve edition being the prettiest. Jes-
sica is an eastern mixture of Turkish trou-
sers and a Chinese embroidered coat. The
vice-regal Forsters were boxed with Rock-
hampton’s bishop and the Jellicoe daughters ;
the clerical dignitary’s sister sat with Miss
Garleton and two blue-lapelled helps in the
side circle. Bill Fanning and Gladys Wer-
theim were having a night out with a party
of relatives on the eve of their wedding-day.
The full house that greeted the “Southern
Maid’s” return to His Majesty’s refused to
be subdued until Gladys had answered back
with a double encore. The Maid’s finest floral
trophy was a flower-weighted wooden dagger.
Two taxi loads of girls in the dress-circle
clung each to a bobbing balloon, most of
the fleet taking flight during the damsels’ ecs-
tasies over Gladys’s wonderful collection of
silk-embroidered shawls. George Gee, who is
giving three cheers to be back in the Austra-
lian sunshine, enjoyed a ’busman’s holiday
in a box. Another pen held the Fordyce
Wheeler pair, she looking her best in wliite
silk.
Gaston Mervale drove home the value of
his Academy of Acting for aspiring mummers
at the Palace Theatre with a fine perform-
ance of “The Case of Lady Camber,” by some
of his star pupils, helped by Arthur Styan
and himself. What the audience lacked in
numbers it made up in quality and enthusi-
asm. Lady Forster, who, with Gent.-lielp
Mulholland, decorated a gilt pen in draperies
of midnight-blue brocade, showed her keen ap-
preciation. Yvonne Deschamps embroidered
the intervals with a classical programme.
The best-known and a big section of high-
brows populated the stalls and circle. The
Dame Best, with a cloud of friends and rela-
tives. got as near as she could get to see
daughter Phyllis come triumphantly through
the part of leading lady; while the medical
Jack O’Briens brought another contingent to
cheer sister Louise Moorehead as the Cockney
maid. Phyllis took her first curtain in an
inky frock and flower-decked hat, and, faded
out in the second act in a neglige of blush
pink and gold. Millie Ryan looked alluringly
efficient in her trained-nurse’s togs, and
equally nice when she downed her cap and
apron for an embroidered chemise frock of
pink.
Following the sale of the old Elsternwick
homestead, Cavers Carre, which has sheltered
the Carre Riddell family since Melbourne’s
early days, Miss Carre Riddell and her
widowed sister, Mrs. Stanley, have tacked
down the lino in a new home in Armadale.
On Thursday and Friday afternoons the two
beckoned in their friends to the house-
warming, and there was a great gathering of
"old families.” Mrs. Stanley hostessed in
black crepe, with old Limerick lace foaming
on the sleeves and bodice, and her sister stood
up in a becoming frock of blue and white
foulard. Amongst the invited were the Mad-
den dame, who is a cousin on the Stephen
side of the family; Dr. Barrett’s wife; the
Charles Mills, Herbert Power, Albert Miller,
Jack Menzies, and Byron Moore matrons;
Mrs. George Dickson and her niece Rita
Watson; Charlotte Macartney, daughter of
a late Dean of Melbourne; and Mrs. Conran,
who lately came from England with her hus-
band to settle in this State, to which the
family was attached in its earliest days.
The decks of the Bay liner Hygeia
swarmed with joyous youth when members of
the Ministering Children’s League went to
Queenscliff to inspect the Cottage by the Sea
for convalescing children. The League presi-
dent, Mrs. Archibald Black, was kept away
by illness, wherefore the vice-president, Mrs.
Fred Scarlett, spoke for her at the official
tea, brewed at the home. The league, she
said, had suffered its greatest loss in the
death of Mrs. Robert Harper, who had pre-
sided over the enterprise ever since it was
launched. Subscriptions had flowed in gener-
ously, and 300 children had inhaled fresh
health with the sea-breezes that blew on the
Queenscliff home. Three cheei's were awarded
to the matron, Miss Chinn, and Nurse Pope.
As Mrs. Saddler was too ill to open May
Vale’s show of paintings at the Queen’s Hall
the veteran ex-Trinity College warden, Dr.
Deeper, completed a half-century of picture-
unveiling by doing it for her. What the
doctor knows about Art would fill a library,
and he spoke with his old arresting brilli-
ance. Amongst those who listened to the
nice things he had to say about the Vale
paintings and Australian art in general were
Mrs. Albert Miller, Mrs. Forsyth Riley,
Mona Mcßurnie and Mrs. F. Watson. In
private life Miss Vale is Mrs. Gilfillan. Slye
is a former National Gallery student.
The Berry-street Foundling Home gets a
nice lift from the cafe chantant which opened
up George and George’s new tearooms last
week. Mrs. Montague Cohen, president of
the home committee, launched the effort. Mrs.
11. J. Robertson provided the singsong, while
Georges threw in the ice-cream and straw-
berries and the damsels to carry them round.
The musical fare was of all-star quality, but
as the crowd insisted on encoring every item
it stretched out too lengthily. Singer Bar-
tolini was the brightest twinkler on the
menu, Cecil Parkes, fiddled with his air of
debonair enjoyment, and Victor Baxter,
Neville Towne, Muriel Cheek and others sang
to the accompaniment of Harold Rogers.
Mrs. Hugo Wertlieim, Mrs. Charles Dare,
Mrs. Gerald Kaye and Mrs. James Moffatt
were in command of some sales stalls, which
helped the ticket money.
Women out back will find mu ,li to inter-
est them in next Tuesday’s Woman’s
Mirror. “Weerona’s” vivid sketch of a
family’s last day on the old selection will make
a wide appeal, and Louis Esson has written
a set of verses entitled “The Young Wife”
that will recall to many a woman the day
when the man she had just married took
her to their lonely home in the bush.
The regular housekeeping, cookery and
fashion articles maintain the standard that
was set up by the first issue, and the free
paper-pattern, serial and £6O prize competi-
tion are still running.
Miss Elsie Morres, head of The Hermit-
age C. of E. Girls’ School, at Geelong, is a
proud woman just now, as the result of a
little talk to her charges on Armistice Day.
She told them of the many incurable cases
in the Military hospitals, whose only hope
was that they might have courage to endure
to the end. The children were so impressed
by the picture drawn that they planned
amongst themselves to send a Christmas-box
to every man in the Caulfield Hospital,
McLeod Sanatorium and the Anzac Hostel;
and 400 parcels containing cigarettes, sweets,
chocolates and a letter from the sender have
been distributed amongst the invalids, who
are deeply touched by the kindly actions of
the little ones, the letters being prized above
all.
Mrs. Stanley Argyle is president of the
Toorak branch of the Alfred Hospital
Auxiliary, and
an active
worker in the
Free Kinder-
garten cause.
She shares the
political inter-
ests o f her
husband, Dr.
Stanley
Argyle, who is
tackling the
job of State
Minister of
Health with
the vigorous
sincerity lie dis-
played in look-
ing after the
health of the
soldier. While
he served with
t h e A.I.F.
forces over-
seas his wife
kept the home fires burning as a Red Cross
and patriotic worker.
A silver water-lily captured the side folds
of Gwen Gulliver’s bridal satin and another
weighted the pointed train when she sealed
her matrimonial nromise to Dr. H. K. Wil-
son at Brighton St. Andrew’s. A veil of
old lace lent by Mrs. Gerald Weigall fell
from the nape of her neck to a head-band
of flowers. Priscilla Weigall walked as chief
’maid in lemon-colored georgette, followed by
Shiela McEacharn and Gwen Johnston, both
flounced in delphinium blue. Little Mar-
garet Gulliver held up the lily-weighted train
in rosy frillings and a blue hairband. Wil-
liam Fleming cheered the ’groom. Mr. and
Mrs. George Gulliver set the scene for the
after-clieerio in their Brighton home, and
there was jazz to follow. The newly-weds
steam off next month to America on their
way to London, where the ’groom, who is
the son of the late Dr. Wilson and Mrs. Wil-
liam Wilson, of Worcestershire, is booked
for a hospital appointment.
The earnest face belongs to Muriel Camp-
bell, hon. sec. of the Melbourne end of the
British Musie Club, who has done even more
than her share
in lifting the
enterprise from
a modest be-
ginning to its
present status.
The club’s
chief object is
to foster local
musical enthu-
siasm and ex-
tend a wel-
coming hand to
visiting musi-
cians. Muriel
drives an even
weightier pen
as assistant
sec. to the
Melba Conser-
vatorium, and
is gathering
herself to-
gether to as-
sume full sec-
retarial responsibilities when Lucy Rowe
takes a holiday jaunt to Europe. Muriel is
a violiniste too, and even as a toddler was
never so happy as when trying to make music
from a tiny fiddle. Henry Curtis showed
her how to tuck a violin under her chin, and
the famous Henry Press was giving her her
final lessons in Germany when the outbreak
of war sent her hurrying back to Britain.
Then Florence Hood was called on to finish
the good work. Brootliorn made the picture.
A war memorial was unveiled in the St.
Kilda-road on a recent Sunday; but it was
in honor of the men who helped to “hammer
Paul,” not those who settled W. Hohenzol-
lern’s hash. There was a good turnout;
and of the 200 Boer War veterans marching,
all in civvies, it was noticeable that at least
half displayed badges of the Great War as
well. They looked young enough, compara-
tively, to encourage the idea that war assists
you to remain young. One who took part in
the procession is only 41 now —he was a
mere 16 when he got away to the South
African affair. Not far from him was a
stiff-backed marcher on the verge of 70. He
was on the way to middle age when he fought
against the Boers and GO when lie got the
A.I.F. authorities to accept his nephew’s
birth certificate as his passport to khaki in
1015.
Margaret Bakhap, elder daughter of the
late Tasmanian Senator, and Harold Dalton,
who hails from Ballarat, were married at
the Sacerd Heart Church, St. Tilda, one
night last week. Dr. Loftus Hill convoyed
the good-looking bride, whose white embroid-
ered silk frock was of a superlative weave
which seldom finds its way here. It was
brought to her by her late father, who was
very proud of having some of the oldest
blood in China in liis veins. The embroidered
net veil lent by Mrs. Alfred Moses made a
pleasing background for the lilies sheaved
in her arm. Sister Judith ’maided like a
fluttering orchid, and Katherine Moses scat-
tered rose petals under the bride’s satin-shod
feet. Joyce Hazeldine, dressed like a pink
fairy, looked after the bridal train, while
M. Wild best-manned the ’groom. Mrs.
Bakhap, who had the Wickliffe House dining-
rooms for the wedding feast, wore black satin
caped and draped with lace, and a feathered
toque, colored like an amethyst.
Kew lias fluttered a £250 cheque into the
State War Council Appeal Fund as a result
of a lawn fete in the Alexandra Gardens. A
joyous burst of sunshine brought out the
crowds. Mrs. J. G. Latham, who did the
unveiling, applauded Kew residents for
shouldering their responsibilities towards our
soldiers who, through sickness or other mis-
fortune, find themselves unable to keep their
home fires burning. She was browned like
a newly-minted penny, in silk jersey cloth
and a satin hat, cheered by blue and pink
presentation flowers.
John Longstaff’s portrait of surgeon George
Syme, which was handed over at the V.A.T.
gallery the other day, exhibits the portrait-
painter in something a great deal better than
the mere vapid pleasantness in which com-
mercial success lias taught him to use his
brush. This picture shows personality: the
skilful hands of the surgeon are displayed
with fidelity, there is fine modelling of the
head, and the painting of the silk gown is a
tonal triumph. The artist’s pretty-pretty
“Eve Gray,” which has been at a score of
show’s, has found some sort of a market: a
Melbourne journal is circulating color repro-
ductions of the masterpiece of futility as a
Christmas supplement.
Sister Dorothy, whose fame as an Anglican
Bush Nurse for Croajingalong, Gippsland,
has spread through Australia, the other day
faced Bishop Cranswiek in his Sale Cath-
edral, and changed her name to Busby, the
padre in charge of the eastern parish of gorge,
cataract, mighty forest and loneliness being
the lucky man. It came as a shock to bush-
men and women out back to find that they
had entertained Miss Almond unawares—
“ Always thought she was only Sister
Dorothy!” The Bishop and scores of rough
diamonds in the bush swear by her, in dif-
ferent language certainly; but that doesn t
matter, for they all mean the same. Aus-
tralia heard of her first that time she rode
40 miles through half-obliterated mountain-
tracks, and, when further riding was impos-
sible, climbed down and tramped another 20
just to get a poor beggar, down and out, to
semi-civilisation and a doctor; and scores of
other heroic acts have endeared her to women
laboring in far-out solitudes. Croajinger-
go-along rises in its might to say “God bless
you, Sister Dorothy, and if your future is
as you deserve, then you’ll be the happiest
wife in Australia.”
Because of their appreciation of the late
Penleigh Boyd, the art-loving public of Mel-
bourne will find an extra interest in the ex-
hibition which opened at the Sackville Gal-
lery, in Exhibition-street, last week. With
the work of Arthur M. Boyd and Mrs. E. M.
Boyd, the parents of the young artist, are
some bronzes and miniatures by his widow.
The little lady is a Queensland girl, Edith
Gerard Anderson, who was studying art in
Paris when she met Penleigh. There are two
youngsters to carry on the art tradition of
the family.
Summer at last: —
Earth, dizzy in the sunshine, reels;
The crowded masses to the seashore win.
The epidermis from the scorched hide peels—
One touch of summer makes the whole world skin.
Dulcie Bland, the little elecutionary star
who was one of the original Mermaids and
now shines brightly in Repertory produc-
tions, is also playing leading lady in an off-
stage love story. The principal man is
Allan Meakin, only son of the Russell
Meakins of Geelong, who earns his crust as
accountant at the Returned Soldiers’ woollen-
mill. He is a returned man himself, having had
four years with the Oth Brigade. The
wedding bells will not ring for some months
to come. Dulcie’s parents, the William
Blands, live at Brighton.
Frank Clarke, President of the State
House of Landlords, who takes an enthusi-
astic interest in the Navy League, has been
invited to sit down in the League’s presiden-
tial chair, just vacated by Justice Scliutt,
who is off with a year’s leave to join his
wife in the Cold Land. The new President is
a son of the late baronet William Clarke
by his second wife.
The Presbyterians of Red Cliffs have out-
Hcroded Herod in their endeavor to draw
backsliders to the fold: they engaged the
local jazz band to play selections at the
evening service, and announced that the com-
munity singing would include “Mother
Macree” and “There’s a Long, Long Trail.”
It was a good draw. About 50 rolled up
as against an average of half a dozen for
some time past.
Big John McWhae, who was this State’s
Agent-General till July 21, is due home next
Sunday. On Jan. 23 the State Ministry
will have him to lunch, when he will pro-
bably tell why his immigration dreams didn’t
come true.
It is a very business-like age all right. A
handful of club members had organised a
sliivoo to celebrate something or other with
the usual liquid accompaniments. Monday
was the date; a letter, hastily written in the
morning, stated that the writer could not
attend that night : his wife had just died.
“And to-morrow there is going to be the
funeral,” he went on. “How about post-
poning the affair until Wednesday night?”
A word from Adelaide: —
A thermometer that rose to 103 prevented the
revival of “Sally - ’ in her matinee garb at the Theatre
Royal, but she was sufficiently restored to face the
footlights for the two final nights.
A big plane-tree, planted by Theodore Bruce when
he was Adelaide’s mayor, was the resplendent thing
that bore the Christmas cheer for 60 youngsters
invited to the 21st annual “pound day” of the
South Adelaide Creche. The Crfiche is that thrice-
blessed institution where busy mothers have since
1887 deposited their offspring (55,000 depositors, the
books show) in the morning, with the comfortable
assurance that they will get them back in the evening
with clean faces and contented stomachs, all for a
modest sixpence. Half a crown is the actual cost
to the institution, said E. E. Robilliard, secretary
for the past 14 years, and the deficit is made up uy
voluntary contributions.
Undergrads, are busy with their preparations for
their demonstration. Since the late Chief Justice Way
ceased to be a target, their annual frivol has become
more decorous, and this year it will take the prosaic
form of a one-act play in which Margaret Cheadle,
Hope Crampton, L. J. Melville, J. R. Ifearman and
D. P. McGuire will take part.
Senator Benny opened the Arts and Crafts show in .
the Institute Building on Thursday evening. L. H.
Howie is the Club’s president, and his panel of eight
water-colors was one of the pleasantest features.
The homely medium of painted china attracts the
women, and Miss G. K. Good has transformed a
whole trayful of commonplace utensils with her
unique decorations, while Miss Godlee contributes
some bowls of lustrous hue.

An old
friend
Sir, you know what it feels like to
meet again an old friend after many
years, and find him still the same
old friend, who hasn’t changed a
bit.
Kensitas are just such old friends,
because Kensitas never vary. Buy
them anywhere you like, in twenties
or fifties or hundreds, they’re
always the same —always Kensitas.
Something like a friend, that, sir!

Barring accidents, Australia will be repre-
sented in the first Test match, to be begun at
Sydney on Friday, by Collins, Bardsley, Gregory,
Mailey, Oldfield, Kelleway, Taylor (N.S.W.), Hendry
(N.S.W. till a month or two ago), Ponsford (Vic.),
Arthur Richardson and Vic Richardson (S.A.), with
Andrews (N.S.W.) as 12th man. It is a strong
batting side, and most people are glad, for senti-
mental reasons, to see the two Richardsons in, but
there are grave doubts about the bowling. Kelleway
and Gregory couldn’t have been left out; still, Kel-
leway’s form has to be taken on trust—he hasn’t
played first-class cricket since the match N. S. Wales
t>. Victoria at Melbourne last Christmas—and the
giant has yet to prove that he is as good els he was
in 1930 and 1921. Then Mailey, though a good man
on his day, is frightfully expensive when he doesn’t
get wickets—his bowling average for N. S. Wales v.
Victoiia in the last lot of Sheffield Shield matches
was 64- and no one can imagine Hendry or Arthur
Kichardson getting a side out. Against this five
(boffins need not be considered, for it is years since
he bowied in first-class cricket) the Englishmen
Mil have Tate, Gilligan, Tyldesley, Hcarne, Douglas
(or freeman) and Woolley (or Kilner)— six good
men, if not seven. There were always six men who
could bowl in Armstrong’s elevens in 1920 and 1921.
Again where are the Victorians ? To include only one
man from the State which has beaten N. S. Wales
in five of the last six games played, and hasn’t lost to
s.A. since 1914, is absurd; and the absurdity isn’t
lessened by naming Hartkopf and Ryder (who made
a fine century in a club match on Saturday) as
reserves,” whatever that may mean. In this page’s
opinion an Australian Eleven without Macartney and
Kyder isn’t really representative. Macartney wasn’t
available for the first Test, but Ryder was, and
ne present commentator has a notion that the Vic-
torian s masterly batting and his good length bowl-
ing will be sorely missed.
Centurion”: For what they are worth, the bat-
,3 a vT' aKCS , ln I,ls games this season of our first
J®, XI . read fell, even if the 12th man, An-
VnZr ls D sec ? l ? d on the list with 81 for three
Knocks. Bardsley leads with 88, also for three
innings, but V. Richardson’s 56.90 for 10 completed
nnings is consistency personified, especially as his
top score is only 125. Mailey has taken 25 wickets
ior 19.44; Gregory’s 11 wickets have cost nearly
i ea , ch > and Hendry’s ] ” are rated at 31.58.
a. luchardson has 81.12 tagged on to each of his
eignt wickets. Australia’s backers are pinning their
v o,lr batsmen making so many runs that
n? e ., Englishmen will never see them. Tate and
lyidesley may have something to say to that.
* * * *
A team of colts led by that promising
junior, M. A. Noble, who will be 52 on January 28,
snaped creditably against the Englishmen at the
■). ae V Cricket Ground. Their captain, who was
visibly overcome by the tremendous reception he got,
was bowled by Gilligan for a blob, but less sensi-
tive youngsters did a lot better. S. Josselyn made
ln taking style, and Waghorn and the South
Australian Effick were batting nicely when they
were run out. But the most promising of the dozen
was Arthur Callaway, a member of a well-known
cricketing family, who got a plucky 35 when his
side was up against it, and puzzled Hobbs and
Sutcliffe with his tricky left-hand slows. There
are the makings of an international in this young-
ster if he sticks to the game and doesn t drift into
the habit of thinking too much of himself —the bane
of athletic youth.
“Nitric”: Crabbed age and youth were both repre-
sented in the Toowoomba team that played a two-
days’ match against Gilligan’s XI. G. 1\ Barbour,
who captained Toowoomba, is 59, and H. Yeates, one
of the old man’s colts from the Grammar School, is
16. Incidentally, Tate mentioned that the English-
men had made the trip to Toowoomba to avenge
the defeat of their football representatives. Which
is rather remarkable considering it was a League
football side that Toowoomba licked —but, then, it
was English.
“Centurion”: Spoffortli, “the Demon,”
most famous of all Australian bowlers, is to re-
visit. his native country next month. His return
will revive the controversy as to whether he was a
fast or medium-pace bowler, for, curiously enough,
many' people who have seen him in action take dif-
ferent sides on the question. When “Spoff” first
went to England, in 1878, he was regarded as a
speed merchant; at least English writers of that
day, who were well accustomed to fast bowling,
always wrote of him as one. But even then he
was changing pace and length. In 1882 he came into
his great repute as a fast-medium bowler, perhaps
the trickiest and the most accomplished cricket has
seen. One says, “perhaps,” for many men who
saw them both in their time count C. T. B. Turner
as his superior, or at least his equal; Englishmen of
their time will claim that George Lohmann was the
peer of both. In Test matches, with fairly equal
opportunities, Turner took 101 wickets for 16.53,
Spofforth 94 for 18.41, and Lohmann 77 for 13.01.
“Wink”: Tlie first intercolonial cricket
match was a big shock to Victorians. Travellers’
tales had made them confident of their superiority, so
they challenged any other colony to a game at
£5OO a side. This was immediately answered by
N. S. Wales, whose players agreed to travel to Mel-
bourne, but declined to put up the cash. The home
team was a hot favorite, for its trundlers were
competent in the recently imported round-arm bowl-
ing, whereas N. S. (Vales relied on the old-fashioned
underarms. Victoria, batting first, fell dismally
before the despised “grubbers, rippers and teasers”
of McKone. who took five of the cracks for 25, while
Gilbert finished off the innings with 4 for 32 —all out
for 63. This seemed a decent score when N.S.W.
were 8 for 19 ; but here the bowling hero, McKonc,
kept an end, and with the two last players carried
the total to 76. Geo. Elliot, the first great Aus-
tralian bowler, took 7 for 28, and it was only
when he tired that McKone and co. got runs. The
Vic.’s second hit was a procession, 28 being the
total ; but the N. S. Welshmen did even worse.
They had to make only 16 to win, vet 9 of them had
to go to the wicket to do it. Betting, open and
unashamed, went on throughout the match, and there
was much wailing in Melbourne because of the
result, for the misguided locals had given odds of
5 to 1 for big money.
* * * *
“Walcr” ; The N.S.W. selectors have in-
cluded Jack Scott in the team to meet Victoria at
Melbourne next week. The Marrickville express
bowled excellently against the Englishmen, and has
taken 16 wickets at 15.87 in club cricket this year—
the best figures among the fast bowlers. He is very
dangerous for a few overs, but is generally bowled
too long. Sid Everett, who showed promise a year
ago but has since been dropped, has taken 17 wickets
at 18.94. In S.A.’s second innings at Sydney last
year Everett got 6 for 54 on a good wicket. During
the Maoriland tour he took 25 wickets, averaging
19.88. Desmond Mullarkey’s batting average for
the same tour was 36.33, and against Queensland
the St. George lefthander scored, in three innings,
130 and 64. Both youngsters have now been turned
down by the selectors—the Lord knows why.
* * * #
“Lansdowne” : Somebody has been digging
up details about the first bunch of English cricketers
that ever visited Australia, H. H. Stephenson’s team
of 1861-62. At the end of the list was one Wells,
who is tersely described as “a terrific off-hitter
and an excellent point.” Was this by any chance
the father of the distinguished H. G. Wells? The
reference books give H.G.’s. father as “Joseph Wells,
professional cricketer,” and one may come across an
occasional allusion to him in his son’s writings. The
impression left is
that he was not
quite a top-notcher,
but that he made a
livelihood at his trade,
the son rather cynic-
ally remarking in some
family reminiscences
that even in dad’s time
cricket had become
something more than
a game; it was “a
spectacle that people
would pay to see.” In
the ’seventies I have
a dim recollection of a
Wells who played
irregularly for either
Surrey or Kent. This
was probably Joseph ;
but was it Joseph who
came to Australia and
smote terrifically to
the off? H. G. Weils
was born in 1866.
RICHARD
TYLDESLEY,
the heavyweight
of Gilligan’s lot.
“Ex-Englishman” ; I don’t know why they
should have thought it worth while to cable from
London that “a Yorkshire cricket authority” recalls
J T. Brown once hitting backhanded at a bill.
It is not at all the same thing as the recent case
of a left-hander being given out for “obstruction
and unfair play” on suddenly changing to right
hand—a bad decision surely? The fact is that
r°hich S r e tL°7 Sin vi t 0 77k tu hit the stumps
(which is the basic idea of the game, anyway);
and when they first tried “off theory,” the ball that
persistently doesn’t try, but goes away to the til',
it was very properly regarded with contempt. Hornby,
the old English captain, especially, used to signify
the same by a back-handed, one-handed flick It it
as it went away; a foolish stroke, of course, from
its great risk of giving a catch. The ball that
persistently goes away to leg came in much later,
though even more difficult to keep down when nit
than off-theory is. Armstrong as a youngster, about
1902, was quite unpopular in England for what was
called his sheer time-wasting bowling; and Mac-laren
went a step further and, without risk, contemptuously
kicked at it for W-bves
Kicked at lor leg D)es. *

Den till ion . E. A. Mucdonald, till l \ ic-
torian fast bowler, is to play regularly with Lanca-
shire next season. This probably means that the
Yictorian’s contract with the Nelson League club will
not be renewed, for League and County cricket ire
incompatible. Time was when Lancashire could dig
up fast bowlers like Crossland, Mold and Brearlcy
whenever they were wanted, but the Freetrade spirit
of Manchester seems to ha\e spread to cricket.
A NON-TRIER.
BARBER: “How's the rasor going, sir?”
PONY PUNTER ( absent-mindedly ) : “Not tryin ’ a yard.”
‘ Ilaraer” : The reason why a well-known
professional ped. is not likely to shine on the cinder
tracks this year is the difficulty he finds in getting
a trainer. His weakness is beer; and trainer after
trainer has given him up in despair because of his
lapses, just when they had got him thoroughly fit.
This year a new man had some success with the
scapegrace: by visiting all the pubs in the neighbor-
hood and getting the Bungs interested, he obtained
promises that no booze would be served to his pro-
tege. The ped. learned about the procedure, but
took it all good-humoredly. “Well, if I can’t have
a booze, there’s nothing to prevent me buying one
for you,” he said cheerfully, while out on the road
one day ; and soon he was inside a pub ordering the
longest mug possible for his mentor. He carried the
vessel to a side bench. “Now, that’s your beer,” he
said, “but I’m going to drink it. I’ll fight you
for it.” The trainer resigned on the spot.

These were some capital performances at
the Dunn Shield meeting in Sydney on Saturday.
Policeman George Parker won the mile walk in
6min. 28 4-ssec. —6 4-ssec. outside the world’s
record. J. G, Parker, a younger brother, was third.
V. R. Harbison registered 10ft. lllin. in the pole
vault; and Tom McNamara’s furlong in 22 l-ssec.
has rarely been beaten in Australia, although Carr
recorded at Adelaide in 1921. The Polies
collected the club championship for the first time
with a total of 23 points; then came Botany (20)
and East Sydney (15).
* * * *
St. Peter’s School, Adelaide, had a great
day lately when old boys took on the present lot at
mixed sports. There were two cricket teams, the
chief one including old internationals in Pellew
(now a farmer with no time to take the game
seriously), Gordon Campbell and Jennings. The
tennis team included Gerald O’Dea and Roland Kelsey,
The relay swimming race, eight a side, ended in
a dead heat, though among the old boys were
Symon and lan Hayward, who were noted at Oxford
and Cambridge in that sport. Clem Hill took along
a strong mixed cricket team another day, but the
boys got him for 16 and John Murray for 3, and
won easily.
* * * *
The Fox surprised by Ben Martin at the
Melbourne Stadium on Saturday was not the cunning
Fox of previous battles. After patronisingly consent-
ing to fight Benjamin as a substitute for the Yankee
Pilkington, who had fallen ill, the Englishman
apparently neglected his training. That can be the
only explanation of his inferior showing. Martin, who
in ordinary life follows the mild occupation of an
accountant, is 23, and, although consistently success-
ful, his fights hitherto had been minor affairs. The
youhg man’s confidence in his ability demoralised
the unprepared Fox, who was beaten at his own
in-figliting game. Martin piled up the points, and,
desperately as Fox strove for a knockout, which, after
the early rounds was his only chance, the new
featherweight star’s victory was substantial.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo”: Talking of Chinese boxers
(B. 11/12/’24), Jimmie Sharman had one who used
to be a great draw at agricultural shows. Jimmy
once took him to Cooma (N.S.W.) with an abo. pug.
(since dead), and offered a pound to the lad who
could hold him for a round. We hunted up our
local champion, a heavy-footed yokel with a vacant;
face, and led him into the ring. He took one glance
at Confucius and fled. “I wouldn’t mind talcin’
on the nigger,” he explained afterwards, “but, be
cripes, you don’t see me gettin’ into holts with that
('how. Why, a bloke might get a knife stuck inter
’im when ’e wasn’t lookin’!”
* * * *
Lornstock, a five-year-old bay gelding by
Wakeful’,s son Baverstock (sire of David and Enere)
out of Lovelorn, annexed the £3OOO Victoria Park
Cup at the Sydney “pony” course of that name on
Saturday. He started at 0 to 4 on in his division,
and so impressed MeShortodds by his easy victory-
he won piffling up in lmin. 20jsec., a course-record
time for seven furlongs—that 4 to 1 on was demanded
in the final, in which he was hard put to it to
catch the outsider Mumbil, a thing by Murillo.
Brittle Star, another favorite, was far too good for
his opponents at the weights' in the Sir Herbert
Maitland Stakes, a thousand-pounder run over half
a mile. Both are owned by Bob Skelton, an eccentric
character who provides a lot of winners at the
“ponies” although his training methods are un-
orthodox, and were ridden by E. Henry, who was
first home seven times during the afternoon.
* * * *
“Centurion” : “Baron” Brown’s transfer of
his horses to yet another trainer recalls legends of
the late volcanic Duchess of Montrose (“Mr. Manton”)
and the “old” Lord
Glasgow, contemporary
of Lord George Bent-
inck and other heroes
of the golden age of
English racing. The
Duchess usually
changed, her trainers
when a bill was pre-
sented, but Glasgow,
who had more money
out of coal and iron
mines than he knew of,
did it in a series of
attempts to change his
luck, for in some five
and twenty years as an
owner he never won a
decent race. This was
due as much to his
ideas on breeding as
anything else, for he
bred his own horses.
His Ludship endeared
himself to the King by
refusing to name his
prads, which usually
started as “The colt,
or filly, by So and So.”
Op two or three occa-
sions he made a fresh
start by having all his
horses shot, but even
that didn’t better
things. It is on record
too, that he was one
of the few men who
shut up Bentinck, then
dictator of the Jockey
Club. Bentinck plain-
tively asked at Tatter-
sail’s if no one was
game to lay him 5 to 4
against a_ hot favorite.
“I will,” said Glasgow. “Yes, but I want it to
n!o ? ey - -x, ‘ Then £lOO,OOO to £80,000” was the
reply. No bet.
* * * *
Although three 5-to-2 chances in Lady
Mornington, Flyaway and Buckra got home at Moore-
field (N.S.W.), Buckra in the principal race of the
day, results mostly favored the compilers of libretti,
who had their usual weekly “skinner”—Royal Em-
brace in the first division of the Nursery Handicap
this time. Consistent Valais Queen (B’s) beat a
good field pointless in the six-furlongs Moorefield
Stakes. Kilkenny Lass tried to make a runaway
race of it, but the chestnut daughter of Valais— 1
Military Cross had her settled at four furlongs, and
exhibited too much toe for the Maorilander Lovesign
and the former “pony” Coleus in the straight. Valais
Queen is not in the Villiers on Saturday, but
with 7st. 111 b. (21b. less than at Moorefield) she
will give a lot of them a headache in the Carrington
Stakes on New Year’s Day. Note, All Home, Mont
Clair and other Villiers candidates were produced in
the Carlton Mile, which proved a good thing for
little Dainty Toy (14’s), a six-year-old brown mare
by Little Toy-—Hidden Waters, who is not •in the
Villiers. Note showed pace for a time, and All
Home was running on well at the finish, but
neither is perhaps forward enough to win the Rand-
wick mile. The English horse Cistercian (Bst. 21b.)
looks a better proposition, and honest Royal Dighton
(7st. 31b.) may be the least unsafe tote bet.
* * * *
“Flicker”: The train which carries me to
Adelaide and toil o’ mornings passes close to Mor-
phettville racecourse. The other Monday as we mean-
dered by this popular resort we noticed a horse
being ridden into the straight. We watched the
animal meditatively, and someone remarked, “I wTon-
der what that is?” Then Jones, who had been sitting
morosely in his corner, chipped in. “It’s probably
that blankard I backed in the last race on Satterdee
just coming in,” he growled.
* * * *
During the wagering on the Mentone
(Vic.) Handicap Irish Rhythm, a strong ante-post and
newspaper tip, faded out to forlorn odds. He ran
accordingly, and the stewards held an inquiry, but
nothing serious resulted, beyond some general remarks
about “vague suspicion” and “benefit of the doubt.”
Probably the truth is that the chestnut has had
about enough of it, and ought to be spelled. Sailing
Home was the closing favorite, at 2’s, and he was
three lengths ahead of Wurdi and Valrona after the
10 furlongs had been traversed in the smart time of
2min. Dempsey rode him.
* * * *
With Raymond, Rowe, Wallace and
Wesche (Australia), and Aitken (M.L.), in the side,
Oxford beat Cambridge in the Rugby match by j.l
points to 6. Wallace, of Sydney Uni., N.S.W. and
Scotland, scored for the Dark Blues, who have an
unusually good team this year, as witness their
excellent showing against the All Blacks. The latter
have had another successful week. After defeating
Warwickshire by 20 —0 they met Combined Services
at Twickenham before George Rex and 20,000 others
- —and, playing their finest game to date, won by
25 to 3. The Sendees team, always a first-class one,
was at full strength and had previously played four
matches with the same side to get combination.
SANG AZUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A bookmaker, fined £5O at Barnsley, England, on
a charge of using an old bakehouse for the purpose
o: betting, remarked to the Bench: ‘lf you bet ui
the street the fine is £5, but if you bet like a
gentleman, as I do, it appears the fine is heavier.”
Herd not with the too common sort,
Tough touts and seedy hangers-on
Who book their bets in any port
And wholly lack a sense of ton ;
The kind that chances Fortune’s rubs
With sneaking bets in furtive pubs,
And helps to bring beneath a ban
The grand old name of gentleman.
On this fair precept ponder well:
“Noblesse obligej blue blood will tell.”
’Tis not for every wight to tread
The Jockey Club’s encloistercd fulls,
Or lay the living and the dead
In Hebrewed ease at Tattersall’s;
Yet man may gather in the oof
Beneath a humbler, lowlier roof,
Provided, in his mien we see
True tinge of aristocracy.
So let our slogan rise and swell:
“Noblesse oblige; blue blood will tell.”
Yet, should it be that, hardly hit,
You shrink before the vulgar shock
Of backers of the favorite,
And time is ripe to take the knock;
When, as you make your run, the pack
Bays, hot and eager, on your track,
’Twill solace be to jou ahead,
If true to sprinting strains you’re bred.
Far, far, behind you dulls their yell:
“Noblesse oblige; and blood will tell.”
To all men cometh, soon or late,
The call to face the consequence
Of good and evil ; then, sedate,
Calmly negotiate your fence.
Stricken maybe by deed or word
More sorely than the common herd,
Reflect! what consolation then
That you are of the Upper Ten;
Serenely sure, in Heaven or Hell,
“Noblesse oblige; blue blood must tell.”

TOURING CAR
It is frequently asked how a car so light can
be at the same time so remarkably sturdy.
The answer, of course, is simple. Pressed
steel parts and perfectly designed steel
forgings are used instead of heavy castings.
Combined with the admirable design and
balance of the car, this construction results
in ease of control, greater tyre mileage, low
upkeep cost and long life.

THE INKY WAY.
John Watson, editor and part proprietor of the
Border Watch, Mount Gambier (S.A.), had his
90th birthday on Nov. 16.
Exit from the Inky Way, at 70, James Kemp, whose
last big job was Victorian Government Printer.
Starting at the basement, he worked up successive
flights to the top floor. He was born in Melbourne
■ 7 0 years ago.
“Stellsby”: The authorities within my reach dis-
agree about the past tense of the comparatively new
verb “to broadcast.” The Aoe ranges itself with The
Bulletin in adding the “ed” ; the Anous and a host
of other papers adhere to “broadcast” in all weathers.
Which is right or is either wrong?
“Keystring”: My paragraph noting the retirement
from the Inky Way of 11. B. AVaterhouse (B.
27/11/’24) seems to have been open to the con-
struction that the veteran journalist had finished with
mundane affairs altogether. May I add that “Ben”
is very much alive? It is only in his newspaper
capacity that he has gone to press.
A familiar figure in Melbourne during the last
year is tall Hubert Church, veteran Maoriland
poet, who was well known to the Red Page in
the days of its adolescence. Having left the M.L.
civil service, he did voluntary work with his wife
in London during the war. Settled now in Mel-
bourne, he is revising some of his careful verse,
double-distilling into quatrains what others might have
poured forth in vague streams. Partially cut off
from social intercourse by extreme deafness, he
nevertheless makes his home a port of call for
literary voyagers. Through all his wanderings he
lias clung to a small library of rare books.
“Uramao”: The review of Harry Holland’s poems
(B. 6/11/’24) reminds me of a good Spoonerism that
was once more quoted than any of his verses. With
his flying squadron of Laborites, the fiery bard was
espousing the cause of the M.L. railway men during
the strike last Easter. When he arrived at Oamaru
he denounced the Government and predicted its speedy
downfall. “Mark my words,” he declared, “the
Government will come a thickening sud very soon.”
But it was Harry’s party that came the sud. The
Very next day the car capsized and the whole batch
of Labor orators were sent to the hospital, though
none was seriously injured.
“Uramao” : A Maoriland pressman shrivelled up the
other day under the fierce glare of the Official Assignee
and the glum-looking creditors of an insolvent native.
After the examination of the unperturbed Maori re-
garding his methods of finance, the flippant reporter
whispered into Hcnare’s ear that if he had any money
he must shout for the crowd. The obliging Maori
dived into his pockets, fished up a half-crown, and,
thinking it a part of the bankruptcy procedure,
handed it over to the Official Assignee with the sug-
gestion that all hands should drink luck to the
creditors at his expense. The outraged Assignee trans-
fixed the prompter with a glittering eye, and the
humorist tried to creep between the pages of his
notebook.
“Claude de Tropic”: Gone are the days of the ol 1-
tirne newspaper office in N.Q., and the “presses,” over
which we lost much perspiration in bygone years, now
lie rusting in back yards or are used for pulling
proofs. One such relic may still be seen in Bowtn
(N.Q.) ; the iron eagle, still perched on the rusted
frame, has watched the progress of the town for 69
years. This press turned out. in 1864, the first issue
of the Port Denison Times, the first paper published
north of Rockhampton, but defunct these many years.
Nowadays the smallest offices in N.Q. have Wharfedale
machines. Many of them have linotypes, so that the
nomad comp, who carries “the curse” around the
roof of Bananaland finds it difficult to get a few
days’ type-snatching in the old way.
“T. 8.0.”; Even English book-publishers are adopt-
ing the tricks of the unconquerable Yankee salesman.
Harraps lately opened “a great novel competition.”
Six books are to be selected. The authors are to
receive substantial royalties on world sales and share
in proceeds from serial and film rights. In addi-
tion the authors of the two best-sellers during a period
of 365 days from publication are to receive prizes
of £250 and £lOO respectively. Also “to arouse
interest in the competition” a prize of £5O is offered
to the reader who sends a correct forecast of the order
in which the six novels will stand in relation to the
number of copies sold by 6 p.m. on Dec. 31 next;
and to arouse the interest of booksellers, a prize of
£lO is offered to the bookseller or his assistant
who sells to the prize-winner the book from which
the entry form is taken.
“Coot”; Of the Melbourne dailies, the Argus and
the Herald are the only ones which refer to each
other by name and not merely as “a; section of the
press.” They were not so courteous 70 years ago,
when the Herald was a morning daily. In 1852
the Argus proclaimed that in point of circulation
it was Australia’s leading journal, and claimed addi-
tional credit for having fulfilled to the letter every
promise it had made to its subscribers. Thereupon
the Herald dropped into doggerel:—
“Argus t’other day T was heard
To say he always kept his word,
And ne’er was known to break it.
But zounds ! a man must keep his word,
When nobody will take it.”
To which the Argus came back tartly:
“If what no one will take must certainly be kept,
What heaps of the Herald to the dust-hole are
swept.”
WORDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Words, for alas, my trade is words,” mourned
Chesterton one day
(And he makes a good thing out of it, too, which
is more than we all can say) ;
But “Why are we pledged to parts of speech?” sigh
Knights of the Inky Way.
Astride of a trusty wooden stool we ride on our end-
less quest.
Be it pencil or pen or Remington, our lance is ready
at rest;
And our aim is high, for the word we seek is simply
of words the best.
It may be the sweetest of spoken sounds that a
lovely lyric deck,
Or the cunningest wit to fling a noose round a not
roo gullible neck,
Or, best of the best, the word that can coax the
shy editorial cheque.
Oh, music of sweetheart syllables, the wedding of
rhyme and rhyme !
But always the weak, unwanted words that clatter
among their chime
From ugly imps of the commonplace dogging beauty
all the time!
For God, who made dumb fishes and men, ’tis only
He who knows
The maddening search for the Word Exact, the
fruitless efforts and throes
That bring forth dubious second-bests —10, read of
our verse and prose 1
And God, who made the chattering apes, He only
knows the ill
Of the word in a hurry, sped from a tongue that
hasn’t the sense to be still;
For the wrong word waits like a grinning ghoul to
trip up the human will.
Tis “Why am I so clever?” that troubles fortunate
Lester Way;
But “Why am I such a blithering ass?” the rest of
us sadly say—
We whom words allure and elude and words, alas,
betray!

Melbourne has seen the frothy-moutlied
Shylock of Allan Wilkie so often that it
was prepared to take his interpretation of
a somewhat ignoble Judaean, whose soul
scarcely ever rises above a passion for ducats,
as if Sliakspeare had given Wilkie written
instructions about it; so that the audience at
the Theatre Royal on Saturday was plea-
santly surprised to find there were more high-
lights as well as subtler shadows in the char-
acter as portrayed by the Russian Mosco-
vitch than they had suspected. Where the
Slav actor scored immensely over the Bri-
tisher was in his enunciation. He spoke the
words, which to the Shakspearean devotee
are more important than the action, with
crystal clearness; and he made the Jew a
noble, if a barbarous, figure. A strong cast
kept the piny from bumping badly when
the principals were off-stage; again a
priceless advantage in presenting Sliaks-
peare, who did not reserve his jewels of
speech for the decoration of the stars alone.
Jean Robertson made a lively, graceful and
lovely Portia.
* * * *
Good acting is not the Russian’s only suit.
He staged the show with art and intelligence,
and the gorgeous robes of mediaeval Venice
moved before a background of stately scenery
which, in the absence of definite information
about the state of the Venetian drains, can
be taken as realistic enough for modern pur-
poses.
** * *
Melbourne Repertory players have made a
week of it, giving “Loyalties” and “The
Dover Road” for three nights each. In
“BETTY,” AT SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Hugh Steyne as Hon. Victor Halifax;
Lord Playne (Alfred Frith): “Is it a
lady or a gentleman? The poor jolly
thing has been here so long it doesn’t
know !”
Loyalties” the players were not as success-
ful as they had been in “Dear Brutus”
(which, by the bye, is to be reproduced at
the New Athenaeum, with charitable* objects
in view, on December 23) ; Helton Daniell,
who deserves compliments for good produc-
tion and his own Charles Winsor, had a large
cast to _ handle, and is not to be greatly
blamed if all of it didn't fit at once into its
place. Stanley Smith, as the young
Jew who bumps the loyalties of the others,
was quiet and convincing; Robert Guthrie
gave a smoothy humorous picture of Gilman,
the grocer; and Edith Fraser was specially
good as Adela, Winsor’s wife. There was
also fair work by Isabel Handley, as Mabel
Dancy, but her make-up was wretched. “The
Dover Road” was introduced by the curtain-
raiser, “Augustus in Search of a Father,”
in which Stanley Smith, Norman Simpson
and Harold Harwood, after starting very
well, failed to catch the spirit of the ending.
“The Dover Road” was more than accept-
able, if allowance is made for the fact that
on the first night sundry performers had
often to look pathetically towards the prompt
entrance —and allowance can be made con-
sidering that the production of two plays in
one week by people with other fish to fry is
rather a task. In this Charles Row, who
had not been convincing as Wisden, the soli-
citor, in “Loyalties,” was a very good dominie,
and Helton Daniell was an excellent Mr.
Latimer. Russell Gourlay was better as
Leonard than he had been as Ronald Dancy,
V.C.; and William Holman, as Nicholas,
played smoothly. Both the ladies who mat-
tered, Edith Bell and Elspeth Robertson, did
good work.

Last Saturday old Sol tried one of his hot.
jokes on Melbourne, whose scorched citizens
felt fit for nothing but bed or the beaches by
afternoon. Perhaps the rail fares to the
Flemington racecourse, where the Air Force
had arranged the aerial pageant, were re-
garded as too hot also; at any rate, only
7000 people attended, against the 40,000 con-
fidently expected. Whicli was a pity, both
because the proceeds were intended for good
causes and because those who stayed away
missed an excellent entertainment and a fine
object-lesson. Twenty-one ’planes exploited
all the tricks it is possible for aircraft to do,
and sandwiched in between aerial tumbling,
loop-the-looping, balloon-chasing and racing
were several well-staged active-service stunts,
in one of which a wreck was made of a well-
faked village on the far side of the course
by low-flying bombing ’planes. In another
of these manoeuvres troops in a hot corner
who signalled an air scout about their wants
were fed with ammunition per parachute,
while ’planes kept the attackers busy with
machine-gun fire. An aerial flight also pro-
vided thrills, especially when dummy men
hurtled earthwards from a supposedly hit ’bus
and the ambulance rushed to pick them up.
Flight-Lieut. J. 11. Summers was the chief
aerial acrobat. A repetition of the show
after it has been talked about should produce
a record crowd.
'J' 'f* *e "I*
Amid the sniffings of some of those critics
who believe that no musical programme is
worth while unless the hky audience is
stunned by its unfamiliarity, Amy Castles
made such a popular success of her two Mel-
bourne Town Hall concerts last week that
brother George hastened to arrange for two
extra concerts —one at the Palace Theatre
on Saturday, the other at the Town Hall
on Tuesday. The sufferings aforesaid were
caused by the serving of popular airs as
the second and third helpings which the
audience vociferously demanded after each
programmed number; but the burst of ap-
plause which came as the piano gave the pre-
liminary ripple of melody showed how these
things were appreciated. Amy, gracing each
appearance with charming smiles, has lost
some of that freshness of voice which was
an early charm, but she still possesses a very
fine tonal quality, and showed dramatic force,
chiefly in “Ah Fors e Lui.” Cappelli has
not been heard in better voice in Melbourne,
and in several numbers he scored honors;
but A. C. Bartleman, although he did not
achieve as great a popularity, was on a
higher artistic level in some of his numbers.
He was less successful in the duet from
“Rigoletto” with Eileen Castles; but his
singing of “Visione Fuggitiva” at the second
concert was fine. Eileen’s notes are not
invariably true, but her voice has such a
pleasing quality that the technical inaccu-
racies passed unnoticed. Of the combined
numbers a trio from “Faust” by Amy Castles,
Cappelli and Bartleman was most effective.
Kost was an excellent accompanist, un-
wearied in well-doing, although the numer-
ous encores kept the concerts going much
later than is usual for such affairs.

Melbourne’s rash of pictures:—
Some very attractive work is shown in the exhibi-
tion of aquatints, drypoints and etchings by Lionel
Lindsay and etchings by Sydney Ure Smith at the
New Gallery, although the work of the latter is
sometimes harsh and fails to give a sense of distance
and atmosphere. “A Sunlit Barn” (No. 32), for
instance, does not look sunlit; but “Hawkesbury
River Farms,” “The Three Barns,” and “A Reach
of the Hawkesbury” are excellent, and several items
(“Burdekin House” and others) have a historic inter-
est. Lionel Lindsay has used his aquatints to pro-
duce very beautiful sky effects in “Dawn” and “The
Summer Moon” ; amongst the etchings, “The Selector,”
“A Pannikin of Flour” and “The Compliment”
have most distinction. A collection pleasant to see,
and see again.
There is nothing very distinguished, but nothing
at all that isn’t pleasing, about the show of Mrs.
E. M. Boyd, Mr. Arthur Boyd and Mrs. Penleigh
Boyd at the Sackville Gallery. Mrs. E. M. Boyd
has a capacity for using wind-swept trees decoratively.
“Across the Bay” (No. 3) and “Winter Morning,
Sandringham” (No. 7), are particularly attractive. Mr.
Arthur Boyd has more ambitions, but his 21 water-
colors and one oil (No. 42, “Moonlight”) are a
very uneven lot. Generally they are not good; but
there is some force of suggestion in No. 37, “A
Bay Trader.” Mrs. Penleigh Boyd’s contribution is
five miniatures, and some beaten brass work.
All sorts of odds and ends strike the eye of
Miss May Vale (Mrs. A. Gilfillan) and suggest an
immediate recourse to her oils or water-colors. When
she is not inspired to paint she enamels. An exhi-
bition of her mixed products at the Queen’s Hall
shows that the garden of her art is full of weeds,
and that the artist has refrained from doing any
culling for fear, it may be, that her judgmeni
between flowers and weeds may be at fault.
At Margaret McLean’s studio, Collins-street, W.
D. Knox has a collection of paintings of small sailing-
ships tied to wharfs. One of the vessels would be
horrible to sail in; although, as this writer has never
sailed in a vessel with a lopsided bowsprit and bow,
he is unable to say precisely what would happen.
MELBOURNE MAJESTY'S.
The Shylock of Maurice Moscovitch.
In spite of a disregard for atmosphere, the artist has
done rather well in some of the others, notably “The
.Ship and the Town.” Attached to the show are some
agreeable etchings, including work by Frank Brang-
wyn, A. \V. Barnes, D. G. Sturgess and Albany
Howarth. But even from these the pictures of
London by W. Walcott (“London” and “The Horse-
guards” the best) and the lively child studies of
Eileen Soper (“The' Flying Swing” and others) stand
out conspicuously.
** * *
Melbourne Majesty’s has been filled with
the worshippers of Gladys Moncricff, who,
helped by Howett Worster, has been a four-
nights Dolores in “A Southern Maid.” Gladys
overshadowed even Worster. though his Dick
Ilawdon was a brighter spark than he himself
has been of late. Josie Melville brings in
“Good Morning, Dearie,” at this house on
Boxing Night.
** * *
There are murmurs of impending changes
at King’s (MelK). “The Truth About
Blayds” will be told at the week-end; and,
after that, “Trelawney of the Wells” comes
next on the Vanbrugh-Boucicault list.
** * *
The Fuller-Wards are busy people in Mel-
bourne these days. Their “Cinderella” is
to open at the Princess’s on Saturday, and
at the same hour “The Midnight Frolics”
will kick off at the Palace.
v SjJ v
“Betty,” at Sydney Majesty’s, is still pre-
senting a whirl of girls and earls, also a
medley of catchy songs and a fine selection
of heel-and-toe work.

“Wildflower” continues to bloom riotously
at Sydney Royal under Italian skies. There’s
nothing shy or shrinking about it; as a
floral exhibit it’s in the same class as Sturt’s
desert-pea.
** * *
At Sydney Opera House “The Rise of
Rosie O’Reilly” is billed for Saturday night,
and on present appearances Dot Brunton is
going to make it as glorious a phenomenon
as she did in Melbourne.

Maidie Scott is the artist who makes the
current takings of Sydney Tivoli resemble
the winnings of a Randwick bookie on a
good day. Her subtle artistry is seen to
advantage when she appears as a bashful
miss who was glad she had taken mother’s
advice, or a young woman who has a grudge
against the wind for blowing in the wrong
direction. Vernon Watson has those who
have neglected to consult their programmes
scratching their heads. His impersonation
of Wilkie Bard is a fine piece of work, and
so is his mimicry of Albert Chevalier. The
four Ortons consist of three slick wire-walk-
ers, a really clownish clown and a duck that
certainly won’t be killed for Christmas.
** * *
There are four formidable items on the
Fullers’ Sydney bill this week —Amy
Rochelle, principal boy of countless panto-
mimes. good-figured and a snappy singer;
Mayne Lynton and NanCye Stewart, who
provide an entertaining storyette set to
music: and Gracie Dorran, a piquant
comedienne who sings of love, smiles and
kisses in a way that the writers of such songs
pray they will be sung. On the same premises
a woman is being sawed in halves. The
sawers have been years on the job; it is
about time they filed the teeth and finished
it.
** * *
The Fullers have coaxed “The Bunyip”
from Oodnadatta to spend his Christmas
vacation in a panto, at Sydney Hippodrome.
A bush fire is to be one of the miracles of
the p. oduction, which is to make a start ou
the 20th.

About a unique collection
Herbert S. Gilkes has been ransacking the Old
Cuiiosity Shops of Europe since he was 15, and
the result, on show at 279 George-street, Sydney, is a
collection of prints and drawings probably second
to none in Australia. His engravings *of the
Flemish, Italian, French and English schools from
the sixteenth century onward are comprehensive
records of the various traditions which would repay
study by local art workers. Piranesi’s great en-
gravings of Roman architecture (1750), the fine
series of early eighteenth-century mezzotint portraits
by Faber, Houston and others, the old English color-
prints full of a simple humor and the startling en-
gravings of Canova’s statuary make one wonder if
the invention of the camera did anything more than
oust a fine, individual art in the interests of speed
and mechanical efficiency. An albumful of fascinat-
ing pencil notes of Italian scenery by John Harper,
the English architect who died in 1842, before he
had time to fulfil his artistic promise; Isome
sketches in Flaxman’s chaste outline and a series
of animated figure studies by Lanfranco (1581-1647)
are among the collector’s treasure trove. A picture
of a night at the Union Club a hundred years ago
showing C. J. Fox, Beau Skeffington, the Duke of
Bedford, Earl Moira and other notables is a curiosity
and explains how the expression “as drunk as
lords” originated: a similar cartoon would make
a fine libel action nowadays.

At Hoyt’s Sydney house Corinne Griffith
is the younger of two “Single Wives,” whose
husbands desert them for various reasons—
mostly the old reason—and the “Pleasure
Mad” family, also at Hoyt’s, is an instance
of how a sudden accumulation of wealth
plays the deuce with a soft-brained household.
Perceiving a coolness in her husband towards
his breakfast omelette and her good looks, a
wife at the Empress dons a mask at a dance
and brings him back to an appreciation of
her charm. “Captain Blood” gets his dis-
charge from the Crystal Palace at the end
of the week, but the waters will be divided
and the pillar of fire will blaze in “The Ten
Commandments” at the Prince Edward for
many days to come.

Roasting weather has boomed the open-
air show of Humphrey Bishop’s Co. in the
Exhibition Garden at Adelaide; George Ross
and Robert Roberts provide most of the light
humor. A “Sally” revival ended the season
at the Royal. Josie Melville is steadily
advancing in the art of charming, and need
no longer rely on that childlike and pathetic
air which makes her say (for instance) “I’ve
lost my bag” in the tone which others would
reserve for the loss of a parent. Crotty and
Le Fre have become immediate favorites, and
Vollaire is a distinct find as a hero in the
Grossmith tradition. Some notes of his
speaking voice are just like Leslie Holland’s;
possibly both men caught them from Gros-
smith. In pictures West’s has a seasonable
Elondyke melodrama worked out amid real
snow and ice. Wondergraph varies between
a Ruritanian romance, by the late Harding
Davis, and rocket work and lifelines on the
Seymour Hicks as Scrooge at Sydney
Opera House.
U.S. coast. The York has a Rex Beach
story, a welter of diamonds, crooks and that
“flowing gold'’ which is oil. And at the

on-liorseback stunt.
“Ticker”: Oscar Asche once put up at a
Potts Point (Sydney) boarding-house, and

“Caesar's Ghost”: Australian sunshine
(with some other influences) brought George
Gee back to Australia in a hurry—as it does
a lot of other imported mummers. He landed
in London in time to meet five weeks of
dank, dismal weather, and, wandering dis-
consolately through a fog in which none of
his friends loomed even mistily—they also
had sought happier climes —he met George
Tallis, to whom he confided that England
was a rotten place for anyone who had
known the sun-wine of Australia. When Tallis
suggested that, if that’was Gee’s opinion,
he might be glad to accept another engage-
ment of 104 weeks down-under, he grabbed
the opportunity. And only a few w T eeks ago
George was saying how glad he would be to
see Dear Old England again, and step into
one of the princely jobs waiting there for
him!
Poverty Pointers, from habitual first-
nighters to once-a-year panto, patrons, will
want to devour Bruce Hutton’s interview
with Irene Vanbrugh in next week's
I\ Oman’s Mirror. And when they have fin-
ished it they will discover a magnetic some-
thing about the rest of the contents that will
prevent them from putting the blue-frocked
weekly down till the lot has been devoured.
The (54 pages are packed with topical fea-
tures that make the number a wonderful
threepennyworth.
“Charlik's” musical memories :
The late Paul Rubens (B. 11/12/’24) when an
Oxford undergraduate exhibited an uncommon gift
for composing catchy tunes, but never seriously
studied music. George Edwardes interpolated some
of his songs in Gaiety productions. Later he became
responsible for complete musical comedies; “Miss
Hook of Holland” was perhaps his most ambitious
effort. His contemporary, the late Lionel Monckton,
had a somewhat similar career, but Monckton enjoyed
the advantage of being connected with the theatre-
from boyhood. His father was Sir John Monckton,
clerk of the city of London ; his mother an actress
who was for many years an important figure on the
metropolitan stage—she played for a time under
her own name of Lady Monckton. I knew
both Rubens and Monckton, the latter intimately.
He was a brilliant pianist and had a marvellous musi-
cal memory. He once played to me nearly the
whole of the first act of a real opera of which he
had seen only the dress rehearsal; he could not
possibly have seen the score. He was a musical
and dramatic critic as well. In the olden days
a composer was responsible for every department
his work. He would do his own orchestrating.
But the manual labor which the production of an
orchestral score involves need not worry the modern
composer. There are plenty of competent technical
musicians, in London and elsewhere, whose in-
come is gained chiefly by this class of work.
Arthur Sullivan never scored the whole of Ids
operas. He would “indicate” what he desired, and
some capable satellite would fill it in. Only the
overtures to two of the operas (“lolanthe” and
“The \ eomen”) were compiled by the composer; the
overture to “The Mikado,” the best of the other
works, was arranged by. Hamilton Clark. Really,
the composition of a musical comedy or comic
opera, assuming that you possess the gift, is not
the stupendous thing it appears to be.
“Drummond Castle”: After the affair of
that Indian Prince and the bookmaker’s
missus, the Lord Chamberlain ukased that
no mention of this disgusting case must be
made in any sketch or play, and proceeded
to lay liis official ban on a playlet entitled
“Mr. A, or a Matter of State.” Neverthe-
less. it is not surprising to learn, “music-
halls and revues continue to have topical
jests on the matter, which are highly popu-
lar.” Seems to me the L.C. generally gets
the worst of it when he tries to put his foot
down on anything in the burlesque line. In
IS9I, when Lord Randolph Churchill (father
of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer)
took a trip to S’Afriea and recorded his im-
pressions in a series of letters to the Daily
Graphic, some of his petulances and fretful
comments so amused his countrymen that a
song entitled “Randy ’Pandy” made an in-
stant hit at one of the London halls. The
Lord Chamberlain came down on it, presum-
ably considering it undesirable that a duke’s
son and an ex-Minister of the Crown should be
held up to nightly ridicule. But the author
merely altered the title and revised the words
a little to evade the censorship. One stanza
of the amended version ran :
I’m only Jack the Dandy-o
Away to Mashonalandy-o.
You mustn’t pain
The Chamberlain
By speaking of Randy Pandy-o.
For the folks who have commandy-o
In this free and enlightened landy-o
Will license again
Such a play as “Jane”
But not a song about Randv-o.
The second song was even more popular than
the first in that it had two butts, the censor
as well as the statesman, but the L.C. made
no further move.
“F.L.H.”: Has Australian music gone for-
ward in the last half-century, or back?
At Melbourne Town Hall in 1872 there was
an Inter-State Musical Festival, engineered
by George Coppin, which lasted a week. The
works of Australian composers were mainly
drawn on, and such compositions as Charles
Packer’s oratorio “Crown of Thorns,” F. A.
Packer’s “Wreck of the Hesperus,” and
“Proi,” by Giorza (Marcus Clarke wrote the
verses), were performed with success. Among
a crowd of vocalists from every State were
Rosina and Fanny Carhndini, Carrie
SHORT NOTICE.
“Pardon me, what are you playing to-morrow
night?”
“‘You Never Can Tell,’ Madam.”
“But, gracious, surely they could have let
you know before this!”
Emmanuel, Amy Slierwin, Mrs. Smytlie,
Mrs. Cutter, Miss Christian. Armes Beau-
mont and Fairfax. Italians then residing in
Melbourne—-for instance* Ceechi. Melba’s first
teacher, and Susini —were valuable auxili-
aries, and an orchestra of 50, conducted by
Julius Siede, supplied the instrumental back-
ing, while David Lee and Plaistod were the
principal organists. Australia has nothing
like that nowadays, although South-street,
Ballarat, does its best. We even send abroad
for jazz bands and hurdygurdy-grinders for
pitcher-shows.
"Hamfat”: Bland Holt was watching with
discontent the work of a new hand who
happened to be a friend of the s.-m., Harry
Norman. ‘‘He’s a bit raw,” said Harry, in
palliation, ‘‘but he'll improve. He’s trying.”
"He’s more—he’s damned trying,” said Bland.
“Darley Street” : Edna Thomas is by no
means the first crinolined charmer to sing
nigger ditties in this country. It must be
25 years since Francie Adler, now r Madam
Frances Alda, of the Metropolitan Opera
House. New York, gave “Swanee River”
and “My Old Kentucky Home,” dressed in
crinolines, as a front-cloth turn in vaudeville
at Sydney Criterion. But they were called
plantation melodies, not “negro spirituals.”
then.
IT’S AN ILL WIND, ETC.
THESPIAN : “O happy day of gladness, re-
joice, rejoice! The value of the accursed
henfruit hath increased.”
GROCFR: “H'm, a lunatic!”
THESPIAN : “No, no, worthy sire! An
actor-r-r.”
“S. Gumm”: Cunningham, who
complains that “people who have invested
their capital in the picture industry are
being harassed by the Minister for Customs”
(B. 4/12/’24), should have a word with his
tellow-Laborist Jones, of the late Vic. Pren-
dergast Government. While Jones was in
office he introduced a bill designed (1) to
prevent the campaign in favor of Australian
pictures being degraded to the nefarious
purposes of the miscreants who make crime-
films, and (2) to censor Hollywood publicity
matter. The present Government is going
on with the measure, and, speaking on the
second reading, its Minister of Forests pro-
duced a copy of a poster which, he said, he
had taken from a suburban theatre,
and which dealt with that familiar Holly-
wood theme, the Story of a Woman’s Soul.
It contained this refined appeal to the mul-
titude to come along with its threepences
and nincpences:—
The Supreme Love Consummated in that Sixty
Minutes of Madness!
I presume the children rushed it —dear little
things!
“Macve”: There's little doubt in my mind
that the taste for lugubrious ditties, men-
tioned in recent Bulletin pars., was incul-
cated in the schools. In the academy where
I Avas trained we had some gems, such as
“The Sad Autumn Winds,” a xvailsome thing
that we used to moan out to a humming
accompaniment, and “The Indian Warrior's
Grave,” another sure sob-getter. But our
star item Avas a dirge entitled “Little Sister’s
Gone to Sleep” :
Lay her playthings all away;
She will never need them more.
Gone the sunlight of our day;
Gone to happy, golden shore.
Clasp her hands upon her breast
While we gently round her creep,
Gone to happy, golden rest,
Little sister’s go-o-o-ne to sleep.
When a cheerful teacher arrived and
scrapped our entire programme, starting us
on a lightsome lay beginning “In the North
Sea Lived a Whale,” avo didn’t care for it
at all. Children are morbid creatures. The
melancholy and sentimental have a great
attraction for them, until their sense of
humor is developed.
“Wodgil” : When the bahss of the Para-
mount aliganisation Avasin Perth last month
he told the local Call that Australia was
a better customer for his cahmp’ny's fillums
—which are alloAved in at three-ha’-pence a
foot, or £B7 10s. for a cahpy of a six-reeler
which might gross £5OOO or £lO.OOO in N. S.
Wales alone —than Canada, which has three
million more people and is separated from
the U.S.A. by an imaginary line. Compare
with this whoop the remarks of Frank Hur-
ley, recorded by the London correspondent
of Sydney Sun, after Hurley had tried to
get the Americans to look at his fine ‘‘Pearls
and Savages” picture :
Australia is potentially one of the greatest film-
producing countries, owing to its climatic, terri-
torial and scenic resources, and also the temperament
of the people; and realistic romances would find a
ready market in Britain and Europe. But it is
useless to attempt to place Australian films in
America, as all the cinema shows are tied to big
producing companies.
blow much longer is Australia going to be
the mug?
“E.T.”: Frank Vernon, whose recently-
published “Twentieth-Century Theatre” the
Red Page reviewer lately found full of inter-
est, is an actor-producer of some tonnage in
England. A practical worker, with no cranky
highbrow notions, he has done notable ser-
vice to the London stage by encouraging
“literary” playwrights. Vernon it was who
brought Arnold Bennett and Edward Knob-
lock together and suggested their collaborat-
ing on the piece now known as “Milestones,”
but which was originally to be called “The
Family.” The grateful authors dedicated the
book to him.
“Ibsenshaw”: The writer of that par about
Barrie’s objection to amateurs playing his
“Dear Brutus” (B. 27/11/’24) was a bit
out of his reckoning. The tricksy comedy
has already been staged by both the Mel-
bourne and Sydney Repertorians. Why
should the Holy City be barred? Apropos,
Dion Boucicault is to produce all the bril-
liant little Scotsman’s best-known pieces pro-
fessionally during the coming year. As the
list will no doubt include “Dear Brutus” the
amateur veto is explained.
“B.B.”: That MacMahon season at Syd-
ney Lyceum (B. 11/12/’24) prospered ex-
ceedingly for a time. Grattan Riggs gave
the brothers a good start in October, 1897.
with “The Irish Detective,” and others who
appeared at the Lyceum during their tenancy
were Rignold, Dampier, Jack Sweeney,
Lilian Wheeler, Inez Bensuzan, Harry Diver,
Helene Bivrdett, Frank Harcourt, Fanny
Liddiard, Lilian Tree, Farley, Harry Shine,
Maud Williamson and Alf Woods. Jimmy
Hazlitt, now at Sydney Majesty’s, was for
a time producer. But Jim and Charlie hadn’t
the knack of holding what they made. They
were lovable chaps and fine pals, and that
may have been the rerfson. Peter Davidson
Simmonds celebrated their propensity foi
hustling in a neat stanza contributed tr
Melbourne Bohemia: —
Two little kids in two little shirts
Came in with the garish morn,
And said, “Will you state in a ‘local’ please,
That Charley and Jim are born?”
Jim once had the opportunity of becoming
private secretary to Westinghouse of the
brake, and often sighed his regret that he
hadn’t accepted.
“.Tacky Roo”: Kipling (B. 11/12/’24)
once adapted “The Light that Failed” and
tried it on a London audience. It was a
failure, and Kip. never repeated the experi-
ment. Nevertheless “The Story of Jie Gad-
bys,” presented by a decent company, would
make a playlet far superior to some cf the
muck we have to sit through these days.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Melbourne Philharmonic
is a step behind the Sydney society, which
has given its hundredth performance of “The
Messiah.” The last of three renderings an-
nounced for Christmas will be the Melbourne
Phil.’s 99tli. It will have the assistance
of Amy Castles, a decided acquisition in a
city suffering from a dearth of front-rank
vocalists.
“F.L.H.”: This month 40 years ago Mel-
bourne Royal saw the good-bye performance
of William Hoskins. He played Dr. Pan-
gloss in “The Heir at Law,” and had for sup-
port Arthur Redwood, Titheradge, R. Stew-
art (Nellie’s father), Herbert Flemming, In-
man and Greville. The ladies were Mrs.
Chippendale, Jennie Watt-Tanner and Myra
Kemble. Old comedy was w r ell and faith-
fully done in that generation; has anyone
in these latter days seen or even heard of
“The Heir at Law”?
“Topee”: I remember hearing Cesehina,
the double-bass player (B. 4/12/’24), in
1878, when, as “the “modern Bottesini,” he
performed at the Academy of Music, Mel-
bourne. According to tradition, Bottesini
used a very small five-stringed model;
Cesehina played on a full-sized three-stringed
instrument with brilliant technique and fine
tone. About 20 years later I met him at
Coolgardie, where he was a member of the
Exhibition Orchestra, conducted by the late
Otto Linden. This exhibition (a Joubert
effort) was an awful frost. Although two
concerts were given daily, there were rarely
more than 50 people in the building after
the first month, and at the last musical show
I attended only nine Coolgardians were pre-
sent. It w T as the depth of winter, and the icy
goldfields blast, whistling through the chinks
of the galvanised-iron shack, almost froze
the players, who looked like an Antarctic
exploration party in their rugs and overcoats.
However, the aged and fragile Otto, clad in
ulster, muffler and worsted gloves, led his
shivering party manfully through the trying
performance.
TO MY LADY OF THE BALLET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mrs. W. A. Holman, lecturing to the Emoire
Poetry League, said that in Australia romantic
poetry was , not as popular as homely verse, thus
reflecting Australia’s hatred of cant and hypocrisy.”
I will not try to sing you, precious one,
As Shelley, Keats or even Tennyson
In rich romantic phrases would have done.
You might resent it,
Being of a race that has no time for cant,
For airy fancies or for high-flown rant,
And show your scorn with that inelegant
“I wish you meant it!”
And how could any plain Australian mean
The sort of guff that Swinburne gave Faustine?
Odes to your dimples, sonnets to your brows,
Even a burning ballad on your blouse
Your merited contempt might well arouse.
Your hair is flossy,
But should I liken it to silk that’s spun
By faerie fingers, magic looms upon,
I know ’twould grate upon you, little one.
Being an Aussie,
Intolerant of humbug, you might beg
Me coldly to desist from pulling your leg.
I might, of course, compare the eyes of you
To stars, or violets shimmering in dew;
And not improbably ’twould be as true
As tales to Dido
That bold /Eneas pitched, or Abelard
To Heloise, or any other bard.
But you detest that sort of verbal lard
As much as I do.
We like our verse as homely as can be,
Rot spiced with fanciful hyperbole.
To say you’re nice and pretty is enough.
Leave it at that. The wild, fantastic stuff
Might earn the most enraptured swain rebuff.
You shall not sight it.
If Mrs. Holman’s an authority
You like your rhyme of frills and trimmings free ;
And if the lady’s got the measure of me
I couldn’t write it;
And if she knows Australia through and through
I’d find no editor to sell it to.

Electricity—
the Ever Ready Servant
IX THEN the era of electricity supplanted the age of steam,
* * driving pumps by electricity was one of the first steps
taken because it furnished greater capacity and adaptability.
It is essential, because of the demanded service, often twenty-
four hours a day, that the pump be ready at all times. A West-
inghouse motor adds the confidence of reliability.
Whether it be in the mine, a thousand feet below the surface, or
in the water works which serves the city, a Westinghouse motor-
operated pump can be depended upon to perform its task. The
long experience of Westinghouse, which enters into all of its prod-
ucts, insures this.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia^
Westinghouse will be pleased to hear from firms interested in
acting as distributors.

Any boy can build this beautiful model of a Shipyard Gantry with Meccano.
All the strips, rods, pulley wheels, gear wheels and other engineering parts
are included in a Meccano Outfit ready to be put together. You can build
hundreds of models with Meccano and they will be just like real machines.
Cranes that lift real loads ; Motor Chassis with 3-speed, reverse and differential
gears ; Clocks that keep accurate time, and many others. No study is
required to build with Meccano, and the youngest boy can commence to
make interesting and useful toys immediately he opens the Meccano box.
Full instructions with every Outfit.
Any toy shop will show you a Meccano Outfit or get one for you.

Blowpipe: But the presence of all those
metals doesn't add to the value of the ore —in the
present state of metallurgical knowledge, anyway.
Beer and tea and castor oil are all valuable; but
what would you give for a bucketful of the mixture
on a thirsty day ?. .. . Burns Road: Topical verse
must sing itself. Even Melba couldn’t sing yours.
. ...8.G.L.: Too careless. .. .R.M.K.: “Crime” holds
no new thought; the other is too long for our use.
....Tom S.: Thin... .James W.: Very nearly; if
this paper could be stretched to hold a few more
columns, Hentain should have a place in it....
Gordon T.: If it were boiled down it would stand
a better chance....D.F.P.: It all sounds incredible.
....St. Just: Comb your brains. You’ve got ideas,
but they are tangled.... Bally: It was trembling on
the brink and its gruesomeness pushed it over. ...
Billum; Not very bright R.8.G.: “Night Mail”
is best; but the idea has been used before. .. .
James Relse: Too long for its interest.... Lector: An
idea buried under words, many of them meaningless.
....Paddy M.: Sorry, but it is quite impossible to
return the MS. of unused paragraphs.... Far South:
We can find a rhyme now and then, but never a
reason.... Fisho: Bards who rhyme “fellows” with
“terrors” and “Chile” with “Yankee” are past
praying f0r.... Caesar Frank: Nearly all your ground
has been covered R. & C. : As lifeless as lib.
of putty... ,K.M.; Hardly attractive enough....
G.W.: We haven’t got a kindergarten class
Rhapsodist: You have made a fine job of burying the
meaning of it. . . .R.A.D.: Already in hand L.H.11.:
You use too many words to say very little that i 3
r.ew. But your study is promising. .. .A Pommy:
The verse is thin and makes a confused statement.
.. . .R.W.T.: No marrow in its bones. .. . J.R.P.; Not
well enough done R.C.N. : A rugged sort of prose
with a few rhymes. .. .Alexander T.: The method is
novel, but the mystery leaves us guessing:—
Hurrah for Bullocky Bill, he’s the gallant lover still;
The bog he minds it’s just pastime
For a man like Bullocky Bill.
It’s one flip of my whip, if my love I miss,
And surely hard to find.
Hello! MeJumps and Jim Jams,
By motor-car they say no wedding bells will ring
to-day.
She got his cash when the wine was red;
Alas, alas for poor Bullocky Bill.
She hopped the train and let remain
This lovely Bullocky Bill.
It’s now in grief without relief
This Bulloeky’s left to whine;
“No boys, I’ll mind, no cooks next time
For a man like Bullocky Bill.
I’ll take my tip next Christmas time
That wedding bells will ring ;
I’ll flip my whip, I’ll take my tip,
The blanky next is mine.
Hello MeJumps and Jim Jams!”
Bullocky Bill coming yonder hill
With a dark-haired lass this time;
He got her track away out back.
Hurrah ! Hurrah! for Bullocky Bill!
... .Billy' 0.: Not bad verse, but it wants tightening
up to tell the yarn properly A.W.L.R.: The sonnet
gets weaker as it goes along C.U.: Hasn’t the
faintest resemblance to anything Maori.... Lorin:
Moves too heavily and fails to say anything fresh. .. .
T.V.T.: You got no mirth out of it.... A.H.K.: Not
up E.J.L.: Poor rubbish. .. .Noo Zee: Horrible
verse and a mirthless tale. .. .Harold B.: Clumsy
stuff repeating commonplaces as dull as copybook
headings Frances T.: The sonnet is in bad shape
and says too little—if it says anything M.M.:
Very poor. .. .Will R.: Weak moral advice in a very
distressing form.... A.L.R.; Seems quite cheerful,
but what is it about ?.. . .M.J.L.: You seem to
have a grudge against both the sonnet and Australia.
Anyway, you give them a great gruelling Egan:
Look at the merry little thing in print:—
When dead it is best to do—
Put me on the cremator;
No disease will be left behind
For my deadly germs to do.
. ...T.T.R.: The verse is so weak that it collapsed
on the mat. .. . Cassar; The ballad doesn’t quite man-
age to get in; but it has a few strong points in
its favor. .. .Sun Goes Down: You forgot to send your
name. But the stuff is too lumpy.... E. de T.:
Weak, thin verse, in imitation of the poor sort
published in American magazines.... E.8.L.: Not
the raisins for our pudding Thelma S.: Hasn’t
strength enough D.P.M.: They all have the same
fault; they take the easiest track and say too little.
. ...R.R.R.: None of them get near... .One of
Them; No merit in the telling Flick: Hardly
fair to collar “The Medical Side” in that way
K.E.L. ; Not a new thought in it —nothing that one
couldn’t get from any poor encyclopaedia E.S.H.:
That furrow has been followed too often.... Fosco:
Rejoice with us over, one stanza:—
The township lay in darkness wrapped,
No silence broke the night,
When what had been a neighbor’s yap
Turned to a gruesome fight.
. ...M.J.M.; Without a gleam of sunshine... .C. 3.
(W.A.) ; We didn’t And truth at bottom of your
well. .. . A.C.A.: Much to learn; learn some of !t
and try again H.R. (Vie.): Your “silent” hero
talks too much, and not to much effect.... J. T.:
Too sad for this season of poultry-slaughter....
M.E.L.: A pearl of no price.... E. 0.: Bush fires do
not a story make, and strong men’s passions .pall. ...
Triton; Good descriptive letter to a friend H.G.8.:
Neither time nor space to waste on your hussy
M.H.H.: Thin, almost a shadow.... R.P.Q. ; Your
pansies would make no pennies. .. .H.W.S.: Wash our
hands of it VV.J.W.: Road comes to a dead end.
... . G.H.: The writing is clearer than the story
0.W.8.J. ; Incident does not make a yarn.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D.O’K.: It may be good and it may be very bad ;
but it’s so dashed microscopic that we refuse to
strain our eyes over it G.S.: That was a good
effect you aimed at, but you need to draw a stronger
bow. .. . J.R.W.: Commercial traveller suffering from
elephantiasis returned in the hope that you will
put him out of his misery as soon as you get him
back... .R.R.T.: You’re merely scratching as yet.
“Mephisto”: The Digger who crashed over
“sage femme” (B. 4/12/’24) reminds me of
the other Aussie in Paris who wished to hire
a cab. His French, too, was mostly of the
pocket-dictionary order. Approaching a jehu
he asked, “Cochon, 6tes-vous fiance?” He
got the whip. Someone explained to him
later that “cochon,” although easily confused
with “cocher,” was not exactly a term of
endearment, and that perhaps “engage”
would have been a more suitable word than
“fiance.”

NEW EDISON
Side by side
is the only test
At Christmas-time, and during the coming year, thousands of homes will
realise their need of music—of its wonderful power to enrich daily life.
To them The New Edison offers an ideal—true music, in all
its glory. It brings not just tunefulness, not just massed
harmonies, but an exquisite richness in qualities almost too
subtle to be given a name. It re-creates for you the Soul of
Music.
To show our belief in The New Edison, we invite
you to hear it in your own home, in direct compari-
son with any machine on the market (or, for that
matter, with the one you already have). Words
'onvey little —side by side is the real test.

A Holiday of Holidays!
A Wonderful Motor Tour throug'h the Paradise of the
South Seas.
The South Isand of New Zealand is the scenic
rainbow of the world, reflecting something of every
country’s peculiar beauty. Every haunting spot in
this wonderful island is reached by a network of
luxurious motor services, picturesquely named the
White Star Tourist Services, Ltd. Sympathetic
experts in tourist comfort have chosen every car
used by this great organisation, so that a uniform
standard of smooth, dependable motoring is main-
tained throughout. Moreover, on whatever route
you choose lie hotels specially recommended for
their warm hospitality, excellent cuisine and com-
plete comfort.
From the day you set foot in New Zealand men
of the White Star will make you a friend among
friends. You will go from host to host a perfectly-
cared-for guest. You will penetrate the mysteries
of the Southern Alps, tall ghosts with a tenderness
for mists. In the heart of this fascinating region
is the famous Mount Cook Hermitage, an all-the-
year-round centre of happiness and frolic, and
mountain adventure. You will go to the shores of
lakes and fiords more beautiful even than those of
Europe, where launch trips are run under the
shadows of craggy steeps, and there is fishing, end-
less sunshine and beauty. You can go deer-hunting
among luxuriously-clad mountain ranges. You
can visit marble mountains and skirt the bush-clad
shores of the blue Pacific.
Yes, come! Here is romance and happiness and
nature more beautiful and magnificent than you
have pictured her.
You will tear yourself away bubbling over with
renewed health and spirits and with a store of
unforgettable memories.
Yet the moderate cost of this holiday of holidays is
one of its biggest surprises.

The Church is recruited from all the other
forces. In Victorian pulpits there are at
least two ex-policemen—one (Good) an
Anglican, the other a Methodist.
Exercising its power to co-opt an extra
member, the Melbourne ’Varsity Council has
selected Acting Chief Justice Leo Cussen. He
is one of the Uni.’s best products—an engiueer
as well as a lawyer and a gentleman.
Gone west, in Sussex, William Britton,
Inspector of Police in Queensland 25 years
ago. lie left £12,000, and his bequests to
hospitals at Charleville, Toowoomba. War-
wick and other country centres are very
welcome.
The Westralian Rhodes scholar for 1924
is Arthur Christian, who lias just reached
the twenties. Applied chemistry is his
special study at the Perth ’Varsity. .His
father was W. Australia's best all-round
cricketer, and the boy is pretty good at foot-
ball and cricket himself.
With a membership of 18 all told in both
Houses, the Vic. Cocky party now holds eight
of the best Parliamentary jobs—Speakership,
Premiership, five Ministerships, and a seat on
the Railway Standing Committee. Probably
a member will also be put on the Public
Accounts Committee. Blessed are the meek!
“Nikko”: Abandoned at the Chatham
Islands, after striking a rock in a storm,
the Rama lies on a lonely, inhospitable beach.
She was originally the gunboat Torch, and
after a few crowded years of naval work was
sold to the Chatham Islands Fishing Co.,
which ran her occasionally to Niue to lift
cargoes of fruit.
Ex-Attorney-General Cohen, K.C., is back
in his old job as “unofficial leader” of Vic.
Leg. Council. The only thing he gets out of
it is a comfortable private room in which he
can study briefs when things are particularly
dull. The Chambah is literally over-run
with leaders —Jones is captain of Labor’s six.
Richardson of the Coalition party, and
Goudic of the Cockies.
Australia’s Chief Justice was born (11
years ago. Knights bachelorships run in the
family: Edward Knox, founder of that won-
derful money-spinner, the Colonial Sugar Re-
fining Co., and the Chief Justice’s parent, also
held the bauble. Young Knox got his Public
School touch at Harrow and Cambridge.
Having eaten the Temple dinners for three
years, he entered himself on the N. S. Wales
Bar Register in 1886.
Only Death could make Alfred William
Leonard change his address. He had lived
in the same house at Williamstown (Vic.)
for 54 years. Born in Devonshire, he joined
the British Navy as a boy, and served on
Nelson’s flagship Victory. He arrived in
Port Phillip 72 years ago in the sloop of
war Electra, presently got a job in the
Customs Department, and served there for
nearly half a century.
Within public asylums for the insane
in the Commonwealth are 19,732 patients,
the total having increased by nearly
1000 in the last four years. N. S. Wales
heads the list with 7991: then comes Vic-
toria, 5997; Queensland, 2542; South Aus.,
1224; Westralia 1079; and the Speck
599. The average in the Commonwealth js
3.61 in 1000. Victoria has the highest rate,
one in 260 persons; the Speck the lowest,
1 in 365.
The death of Cardinal Logue removes one
of the four oldest English-speaking bishops
in the world. He was born in 1840, made
priest 1866 and bishop in 1579. Dr. Red-
wood (M.L.), who has just returned from a
world tour, was born in 1839, made priest
in 1865, and bishop in 1874. Dr. Ilsley,
R.C. Archbishop of Birmingham, was born
in 1838, ordained priest in 1861, and con-
secrated bishop in 1879. Botli Redwood and
Ilsley are natives of Staffordshire. Though
Ilsley is a year older than his M.L. brother
and an older priest by four years, Redwood
is his senior as bishop by five years. The
fourth is R.C. Bishop Lacy, of Middles-
borough, born in 1841, made priest in 1867
and bishop in 1879.
__ The second man to ride a bicycle from
Kalgoorlie to Melbourne was William Snell,
one-time Mayor of Leonora. Like the rest
of the population Bill was a miner, and once
left his claim for a week-end. When he
arrived back on Monday morning he found
a man had jumped it. Seizing a shovel Bill
started shifting, dirt and rubble down the
shaft on to the interloper. The other roared
blasphemy up at him, and by this time scores
of prospectors had arrived to witness the
light. When the “jumper” was about tip to
his knees in muck and it was still raining
down on his head he decided to go up on
top and interview his assailant. Snell peeled
off his coat and waded into his opponent.
Both made it willing, but Snell won, and
started work again on his claim. The in-
truder was wrong, as it happened; Snell
had been absent only two working days, Sun-
day not being counted.
“W.E.F.” recalls a Labor pioneer:—
The voice of Arthur Rae is seldom heard in public
places these days, the little ex-Senator preferring
to disseminate his brand of socialism through the
columns of Common Cause. A Maorilander by birth,
he was one of the first organisers of the Shearers’
Union and spent some of 1890 in gaol, partly for
inducing shearers to violate their agreements, partly
for telling the P.M. that “a man might as well go
to Hell for ice as come to you for justice.” In
IS9I he was a member of the first N.S.W. Parlia-
mentary Labor party, one of three elected for the
Murrumbidgee. When the Duke of Clarence,
George V.’s elder brother, died, he refused to vote
for a of condolence to the Royal Family, and
lost his seat at the next election in consequence.
In 1910 he was returned to the Senate and helped
to force a division that resulted in the first and only
double dissolution; in the election that followed he
was the only sitting Labor member who was beaten,
lie lost two sons in the war.
SYDNEY AT SUNSET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To and fro the ferries glide,
Sunset o’er the harbor streams,
And the city glorified
In the distance gleams.
Curtained, swathed in drowsy light
Stands each dome and tower, high set;
Steeps the city, slope and height,
Veiled in violet.
N.S.W.

CONTROLLING
GAS UNDER PRESSURE
ALL industrial gases, such as Oxygen, Acetylene, Coal Gas, etc., when
■*“ under pressure need to be fully controlled. Control is only possible
with a Pressure Regulator which is absolutely reliable for accuracy, has
the minimum of working parts and at the same time is extremely sensitive.
That such a regulator can be obtained
entirely Australian in design and manu-
facture is something to be proud of.
Comox Endurance Pressure Regulators
are as serviceacle as they are sensitive.
They are fitted with safety valves of
ample capacity and also Comox Pressure
Gauges the most efficient type that is
obtainable. Two types of Comox Regu-
lators are supplied for Oxygen.
Standard Regulators for Acetylene, Coal
Gas, Air, Hydrogen or Carbonic Acid.
Prices are moderate and will be supplied
on request.

“The Dip”: There are more Dr. Jekylls
and Mr. Hydes in Sydney than most people
suspect. The modern crook doesn't reside
any longer in Ultimo, Surry Hills, Redfern
or the ’Loo unless he is of a low type. When
the “demons” are after the clever men you’ll
notice they generally land them at Coogee,
Bondi, Chatswood. North Sydney or some
other red-tiled neighborhood. There they
live unsuspected by their neighbors until
there is a sudden descent of “jacks.” All
the localities named have yielded up badly-
wanted silk-robbers and safe-blowers within
the last month or two.
“Harold Hardupp”: Those people who
make a good thing out of being poor will
find the going harder in Melbourne as soon
as the proposals carried at a conference of
relief societies are put into effect. There
is to be a central registration exchange,
which will pass round confidential informa-
tion about assistance granted to various
applicants, so that there will be no double
banking. Some well-meaning philanthropists
have been severly hurt by recent exposures
of how they have been “had.” Within a
few months three allegedly indigent people,
all scheduled in the offices of various helpful
societies as “most deserving,” have been
shown up by death as the possessors of con-
siderable property after having hoodwinked
organised charity very successfully for years.
Randolph Bedford writes :
“Anti-Dingo” (B. 27/11/’24) finds it necessaiw to
his case against wild dogs to object to the Buwiett
irrigation scheme and loosely says that “millions”
are being wasted on them! This is one-eyed and
cannot advance his case, anyhow. The Government
is not “about to sell the Warrego Rabbit Board fence
for what it can get either as an existing fence or
•as material.” Not just like that, anyhow. The
alleged rabbit fences show so many gaps as to be
valueless as existing fences, and by selling the
fragments as material segregations of the dingo are
to be made and the upkeep of the alleged barrier
saved. The Government is supplying .£40,000 worth
of netting this year, and is preparing for group
fencing on the S. Australian system—which, by the
way, should be imitated in N.S.W. west of Darling,
which sends us almost as many dogs as S.A. and is
as bare of sheep as the fine wool-growing country
around Thargomindah.
“X2X”: “Nitric's” reference to synthetic
sugar (B. 13/11/’24) recalls that experi-
mental work carried out some years ago at
an Australian Uni. with the same object
came within an ace of success, and then ill-
health forced the experimentalist to aban-
don the work. He, too, started from carbon
dioxide and water, from which the formic
aldehyde was produced; but in the next step
towards the formation! of the carbohydrates,
the agency utilised Was pressure instead of
ultra-violet rays, the object being the con-
densation of the aldehyde molecules to form
the sugar molecules. It is this process, per-
haps with slight modifications, which goes on
within the vegetable cell in which sugar is
produced, the marvellous thing being thsit
Nature, though working within microscopic
dimensions, can perfect what man has not
yet succeeded in doing with all the resources
of the laboratory.
“II.II.”: The big Nymboida scheme at
South Grafton, the first section of which has
been “opened” by N.S.W. Premier Fuller,
will provide cheap power and light, as well
as water, for a big section of Page’s New
State area—in fact, it is an important fea-
ture of the New State movement. Nym-
boida is one of several concerns which the
Armstrong Whitworth Proprietary—the Aus-
tralian edition of the big British Armstrong
Whitworth Co.—lias in hand. The Lime-
kiln Gully reservoir, at Glenorchy (Tas.), is
another; and a second Tasmanian enterprise
is the making of the Ralph’s Neck Canal,
which will give vessels leaving Hobart for
east ports and the north a way out from
Ralph’s Bay to Frederick Henry Bay with-
out. going south into the heavy weather fre-
quently encountered there. In Victoria the
same proprietary is in charge of the new
bridge which is replacing the old one over
the Barwon River at Geelong.
“Repap”: Those brethren who express
such concern at the cruelty occasioned to
stock by trucking them for long distances
without food or water should remember that,
though you may take a horse to water, you
cannot make it drink; and the same applies
to cattle. If not the longest trip by rail,
the journey from Oodnadatta to Adelaide is
one of the longest, and it was decided to
ascertain whether cattle could be watered
from the vans, thus doing away with the
necessity of unloading before watering. Ex-
perimental troughs were erected at Ham-
mond. The cattle on the first train after
the work was completed refused to drink, but
it was thought that the troughs had been
too awkwardly placed for the animals’ com-
fort. Adjustments were made, but still the
animals would not take the water. As the
cattle would then have been at least 40 hours
without food or water, their refusal could not
be satisfactorily explained. It may be that
they were too frightened by the train jour-
ney. Perhaps it was because of train sick-
ness. Anyhow, they would not drink.
“Grobak”: This season’s heavy growth in
the wheat country, together with much wind
and moisture, had its expected result in
fallen crops. But after the cocky and his
tribulations have had a hearing, a word or
two might be said for the harvester man and
his troubles. In former times a season like
the last spelt disaster to the cocky, but
nowadays, thanks to the header harvester,
equipped with special crop lifter, nearly 100
per cent, of* the farmer’s dishevelled staff of
life can be saved. Nevertheless, improvi-
dent cockies still prefer to trust in the rain-
god’s sense of moderation, and carry on with
obsolete machinery rather than acquire the
invention in advance. The consequence is
that when the storms come the factories are
bombarded with SOS appeals, and have to
work day and night to meet the rush demand.
In October this year the orders for crop-
lifting attachments amounted to a few score;
in November they increased to thousands.
Expensive brass, being quicker to produce,
had to be substituted for malleable castings,
and although prices were not advanced,
manufacturers were hard put to it to provide
the quantity required.

Rexona—The
Rapid Healer
Mr. Rex Simpson, whoso elover
noting as “The Reverend” in the
latest Australian-made production,
“The Rev. Dell’s Secret,” has secured
him further engagements with
“Special Productions. Aust.,” is a
firm advocate of Rexona. lie writes
us as follows: —
“While enacting the big fight scene
for the picture, ‘The Rev. Dell’s
Secret.’ I had to receive a blow from
a bottle, but, owing to the player's
mis-aim, I suffered from a smashed
nose and severe nose-bleed. Through
the timely and free use of the valu-
able Rexona Ointment, I was baek
on location within three days to con-
tinue (he produetion.”
Mr. REX SIMPSON (from a photo).
Docs It Pay to Take Chances?
. Docs it pay to take risks? Sometimes, but only fools take unnecessary
risks. In the course of the day’s work you get many hard knocks, and working men
and women cannot afford to risk their health. They know that a slight cut or
bruise, a neglected sore or burn, may in
the end lay them up and make them un-
fit as breadwinners. Keep Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, in your home, and handy
to your work. Spread this antiseptic
healer over the surface of the injured
part at once, and keep out dirt and
disease germs while you give it time
to heal. A little neglect may lead to
inflammation, blood-poisoning and pro-
longed sickness. Rexona destroys germs
and forms new skin. Keep the tri-

HILLIER’S
CHOCOLATES
EVERYBODY LIKES CHOCOLATES
THERE is hardly a gift that has as much personality as a box of
HILLIER’S CHOCOLATES. It somehow represents the giver, carrying
with it a suggestion of one’s own character and taste.
Packed in the famous Red Box, which is a presentation package created to
convey, by its artistry of design and distinct color, the quality of its contents.
The rich, smooth chocolate, made to the most exacting standard, the wonder-
ful centres, and the many varieties, have induced people to come to us for
confectionery that is new, that is different, and that always carries a flavor
remarkably good. The results are due to many things, principally, however, to
the fact that, having realised from the beginning of this business that the public
was entitled to the BEST-QUALITY Confectionery that could be made, we
have devoted all our energies to making it so.
“ You can taste the quality.”
Every care is taken in packing, so that each box leaves with the assurance
of reaching its destination in the same splendid condition which characterises its
advance through the various stages of manufacture.
Freshly made —elegantly packed—promptly mailed.
PRICES: 3/-, 5/6, 6/-, 10/-, 12/6, 20/- and 30/-
Post free to any address in Australia. Per V.P. Parcels Post, if desired.
We know there are cheaper Chocolates, but that will not deter us from
our principle of maintaining the standard*of quality
we established in 1914.

will post to friends the

The Rain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE rain is old ; its hair is grey.
It sweeps that grey hair o’er the sea
Just as it swept the barren hills
When all the earth was mystery,
Just as it swept that mystery
When hills were vales and vales were sea.
Fpon the heights of Lebanon
It trickled through the glossy boughs.
It pattered on the scattered palms.
It whispered round the leper’s house;
And you can hear among its tears
The broken laughter of the years.
The rain is old. It trod the plain
Before man bruised the primal moss;
It washed the blood of Christ away
From the wan cedars of the cross:
It brought the scent of flowers in bloom
To Mary watching by the tomb.
It taps its code on roof and wall:
It croons the restless heart to sleep;
It kisses raptures to the grass;
It writes green lichens down the steep
So many gems it has to spare.
It squanders diamonds everywhere!
And low it sang by Pharaoh's bed.
It mingled with the yellow Nile:
It splashed the red pomegranate’s mouth
And saw the wily serpent smile
As she went drifting lazily,
Her eyes caressing Anthony.
The rain is old. For all its age
Its silvers neither rust nor stain;
And though it plays amid the dust
There’s nothing cleaner thpn the rain,
Though it may scour a gibbet down
And race through all the slums in town!
I hear it murmuring in the scrub
A tale the world’s youth left behind ;
It scrawls it down a satin gum
To leave a record for the wind.
For when the west wind*, comes to stay
It always drives the rain away.

M. FORREST.
The Picnic at Cleghorn’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILL of Bringalily drove his light
springcart and big roan down
the hill from his orchard to
pick up the picnic party at Cleghorn’s. He
found the family bustling and excited. Mrs.
Cieghorn was in a new print dress, home-
sewn, so that the loose stitches stretched at
every seam. Milly, fresh as the morning,
had been ready for half an hour, and had
occupied the time in preventing excited chil-
dren running back on the track to look for
the cart. Nevertheless, one of the small boys
had escaped and gone eastward, returning
triumphantly as offsider to Bringalily Bill.
“Pack ’em in, Mil,” said Bringalily.
"Never mind checkin’ ’em by names; just
count, ’em.”
“We’d have to earmark 'em if there was
any more,” gasped Mrs. Cieghorn as she
climbed to the front seat and resumed control
of her latest baby, of whom Bringalily had
temporarily relieved her. Milly packed them
in and then herself mounted to the front seat
beside Bringalily, who thereupon prepared to
drive in this delicious company to Heaven,
along the granite road curled through the
bush like a rope carelessly thrown and snak-
ing in its fall.
“Won’t the old man come?” he asked, hop-
ing sincerely that he would not.
“No,” replied Milly. “Father says he’s
tired, and he’ll have a rest while we're
out.”
“Better ask him,” said Mrs. Cieghorn, the
diplomat, having known Cieghorn to sulk for
days if his sensitive* soul imagined neglect.
“Will y’ come to the picnic. Father?”
Suspense, until the long-faced misanthrope
lifted his head from the sofa on the veran-
dah, and said wearily: “Tired. I'll mind
the ’ouse.” His head went down to the
pillows again, and closed the interview.
“He’ll be all right,” said Milly. “Uncle’s
there to keep him company.”
“Uncle? Is he out here?”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Cieghorn shortly. “Came
last night.”
“Righto,” said Bringalily. “Hold tight,
you kids.”
As the roan moved into a trot he asked for
the man of the house.
“Where’s Jimmy?”
“He went over to Allison’s.” Milly in-
formed him. “He’ll ride to Quart Pot after
us.”
“Good oh! Come on, Roany. Sing some-
thing, Mil.”
And Milly sang as the horse trotted —sang
sweetly, though not too smoothly, for the un-
equal track slurred some notes, and the
deeper and more sudden ruts made gasps of
others.
“Home from the shearing they come—
Longreach, Temora and Hay—
Shearers who carry the drum,
Horsemen and footmen all da-ay.”
“My, that was a jolt, Bringalily!”
“All right, Mil, the horse stumbled.”
“Don’t hit him, then —he didn’t stumble
for fun.”
“Righto ! Go on, Mil.”
“Gone are the sheep from the shed,
Gone the wool over the sea.”
“That was a bad one, Mil!”
“Home from the great plains I’m led
To where my love waits for me-e-e.”
“Steady, roan, steady!”
“Chorus, you kids” —and the bush heard
the shrill children’s voices, gay as the sun-
light and optimistic as September:—
“Near and dear Narandera,
Nearer, dearer, she—
Gone are the sheep to the salt-bush plain,
Gone the wool over the sea-ea;
Near and dear Narandera
Holds the best girl for me.”
“That’s a bit of all right.” said Bill.
“Give’s the next verse, Mil. Here’s a good
patch of road; give it a go.”
“Men who own millions of sheep”
The roan trotted briskly; crops, commis-
sion agents, buslifires, hard struggles and
long waitings were forgotten. Tempo felice!
* * * *
Jimmy Cieghorn put his long leg over the
grey horse at the orchard gate, and rode
west as Uncle came from within the house
to the verandah, and talked to the weary
Cieghorn. To such a temperament as Cleg-
horns the day said “Slumber!” The sun
was running lingers of light over the fruit-
trees. streaking the apples with crimson and
making them glow like the cheeks of chil-
dren. The garden before the house blazed
in its flowers of scarlet and pink and yellow;
the lingering autumn slowly ripened the vine-
leaves to decay, but the strong sun re-
prieved them till a vagrant wind came out
of the blue, lifted the old leaves from their
joints upon the vines, and gently laid them
down to die. The warm air invited to
slumber; the season had escaped being
autumn,'except that, to the temperature of
spring there was autumn's essential feeling
of beauty and the melancholy of its death.
If Cieghorn and Mrs. Cleghorn's uncle had
any such thoughts as these they put lan-
guage to its alleged use of concealing them,
according to the hypocrite who made
cowardice of opinion a virtue. They felt
the sunlight and had a certain animal en-
joyment of it, but to them it was a common
thing and no miracle.
“I wish I had some beer,” said Uncle m
regretful recognition of the fact that it had
been bad husbandry to drink all three bottles
the night before.
“Cuppa tea,” suggested Cieghorn.
“Ar! Cuppa tea! It makes me squim-
mish!” . ,
“Ain’t no beer,” said Cieghorn con-
clusively, and closed his eyes again.
The time going heavily, Uncle walked
round the house thinking yearning thoughts
of beer. He looked at the forest-backing of
the orchard, and decided that there is no
beauty in the pathless woods, and that the
metropolitan roar of Quart Pot Creek was
vital to his hearing.
To this lust for the busy haunts of men
was added the vanity of the public man. Tie
had suddenly remembered an engagement to
ring the bell' for the public dance at Deneen’s
hall, lie enjoyed his work as bellman as
if lie had been a matinee idol; and after
two pints of boor his voice sounded so musi-
cal to himself that the sheer beauty of it
filled his eyes with tears. And so musing
of beer anil of himself as public man and
artist lie turned the corner of the house and
saw a vision of immediate hope.
He almost ran back to the hibernating
Cieghorn, who was a bear all the year round
so that lie should not forget to take his
beautv-sleep in winter.
“Hey, .Tabez.” he shouted, “there’s a cow
in the orchard.”
“A cow?”
“Yus. an’ a carf. Eatin'.”
“Eatin’ what?”
“Crars.”
“Well, let ’em.”
“It’s a stranger cow—red an’ white.”
“Oh. nev’ mind !"
“But it orta go t' the pound!”
“Who’ll take it? I won't.”
“Y" can get hexpenses. An’ p’raps a re-
ward.”
Cieghorn groaned, but upended himself.
“Reward, eh? An’ expenses anyhow? Wait
till I put me boots on. Oh. I say. while
I'm gettin’ me boots on you drive her up.”
Uncle’s eagerness betrayed him into the
work of getting that cow out of the orchard
single-handed. The cow’s ruling passion
was jealousy of the calf; she was red-eyed
from recent experience, and when she
arrived at the conclusion that Uncle was
attempting to drive her, she drove Uncle.
Roaring for help, but afraid to turn his
face from her, Uncle backed through the
fruit-trees towards the gate, and the cow,
with elevated tail and lowered head, ad-
vanced for a dozen paces. By stopping
when she did and backing when she again
advanced. Uncle approached the gate; and
Cieghorn, now booted and standing on his
trailing boot-laces at every step, came to
the resene and manoeuvred the calf outside
the gate, and the cow rushed to rejoin her
child and knocked Cieghorn down with her
offside shoulder. Uncle helped Cieghorn in-
side the gate and closed it, and looked at
the cow as if to charge her with unsports-
manlike conduct.
“Knocked the wind outer me, that cow
did,” gasped Cieghorn. “Pore cow me!”
“That cow won’t drive easy,” said Uncle.
“I’ll take the little skewbald pony.”
“Jimmy’s got the saddle awa^ —y’ll fall
off and hurt y’self like I did.”
“Me fall off a ’orse!” said Uncle, actively
engaged in a representation of vain-glory
going to its destruction. “Why, on me
uncle’s farm in Hinglan’ I’ve rode ’orses —
bigger ’orses than the pony. I’ll ride ’im
bareback.”
Cieghorn offering no further comment
except that he had abandoned the expedi-
tion, Uncle caught the pony—a pony as
quiet as a sheep, for the reason that almost
the first occupation of the Cieghorn children
was crawling all over him, as if he were a
mat. Uncle bridled the pony with ,‘the
plough-horse bridle, which was four sizes too
large, and fastened with a surcingle a chaff-
bag round the pony, and led it to the gate.
The cow looked at Uncle as he closed the
gate, but apparently regarded the pony as
sane protection against little madmen with
white whiskers, and Uncle scrambled to the
pony’s back and rode at the cow—-a pale
white-whiskered Death on a skewbald going
forth conquering and to conquer.
Then the cow, respecting the horse as it
despised the man, accepted the inevitable
and trotted clumsily down the road, step-
ping upon its own calf as it ran, its pink-
ish udders flapping from leg to leg. And
Uncle rode after her, a conqueror. Several
times the cow turned on him, but the menace
of the horse corrected her, and she resumed
the journey. Then, weary of pursuit, she
broke into the bush, and Uncle was mad
with anger and stress and movement be-
fore he got her back to the road again.
At last they came out on the hill west of
Quart Pot Creek, and there was the banner
of the Southern Cross —the Australian flag
of the stars waving over the Sports Ground
and the picnic, east of the city of Denny
Deneen.
Uncle rushed the cow down the grade and
into the creek, and the cow proved that turn-
ing is not the exclusive property of worms.
Stumbling over her weary and tottering
calf, she wheeled suddenly on the pony, who,
being an old stager, swerved out of her rush.

Then must the frightened Uncle clap his
heels into the barrel of the pony ; and that
long-suffering animal, weary of the whole
protracted foolishness, propped; and Uncle
fell upon the leaves of granite that floored
the creek. With the cliaffbag-saddle flap-
ping between his hoofs, the skewbald put
his tail up and took the road for home.
The cow breathed heavily, looked at the
fallen enemy, and regarding him as worth-
less of reprisal, resumed her course across
the creek and up the hill to the township.
Uncle followed, groaning heavily.
At this stage he saw how from the nettle
Danger to pluck the flower of pound-fees.
Two boys, the Bedouins of Quart Pot, rode
their ponies across the creek and stopped
to Uncle’s signals of distress.
“Wodger want, whiskers?” inquired the
elder, a youth of 12, so freckled that there
was no room on his face for original skin.
“That there cow. Trespassin’ they was.
’Elp me to put ’em in the pound.”
“My oath !” said he of the freckles. “I’ll
head her off; Bill, you go in the lead.”
Freckles galloped and headed off the wan-
derer from the entrance to the main street
of Quart Pot; like an old drover the younger
boy put his pony ahead of her; and the
cow, seeing at last the game being played
according to Hoyle, bellowed her accept-
ance of the position and trotted behind the
pony into captivity.
Uncle thanked the boys, ruining himself
with promises and becoming solvent again
by resolving to pay naught. Then he inter-
viewed the poundkeeper, and duly logged the
wanderers, and, full of the joy of achieve-
ment, and hotfoot on the track for the
owner so that he might collect “expenses,”
he made his way to the Sports Ground
under the granite cliffs that frowned upon
the township.
Almost the first men he met were Jimmy
and Denny Deneen.
“I thought you were staying the day with
the old man,” said Jimmy Cleghorn.
“Yus, I was goin’ter,” replied Uncle. “But
I seen a cow an’ a calf trespassin’, an’
I brought ’em inter the pound.”
“Why, then, you’re doin’ somethin’ useful
at last, then,” said Denny Deneen. “An’
good, kind work it was too—all these
shtrayin’ cows will ate up a man’s catch-
crops, mind you, or shlapin’ in the roads
dark nights, an’ horsemen fall over thim an’
break a collarbone, an’ the loike uv that; an’
couples shweetheartin’ failin’ over a cow that
shtand up before they’re half down would
roon manny a marri’gc, mind you. And
whose cow was it, then?”
“I dunno. The poundkeeper’s got the
brands. Red-an’-wliite cow, an’ red calf at
foot; an’ the brand’s crescent-five-crescent.”
“What!” said Jimmy Cleghorn. “Cres-
cent-five-crescent?”
“Yus. A thing like a noo moon, an’ then
5, an’ then the thing like the noo moon
agen on the near shoulder.”
“And you took them out of my paddock?”
“They was in the orchard.”
“You dam’ old fool! That’s the new cow
and calf I bought and drove home to-day.
And you pounded my own cow off my own
place ! You —you”
“Well, well!” stammered Uncle under the
storm. “How wus I ter know?”
“Me old man was there when I drove
them home.”
"But he was asleep.”
“Be the hokey, he’s always ashleep,” said
Denny Deneen. “An’ vou too —ashleep in
your moind, day and night. Coin’ into
Jimmy’s House there, and takin’ his cow
and his calf and puttin’ them in the pound!
The poor cow an’ her shuckin’ calf shtrayin’
in their own house! You loonatic crayture,
y’ have nsn-liooKs in your brain, an’ laziness
in your bones, an’ confushidn in vour moind.
Dam’ lazy bellman-loafer it is! Arrest
him, Jimmy, an’ I’ll give him twinty years
for cattle duffin’.”
“You know I can’t do that, Mister Deneen
—mother’s uncle an’ all. But I wish he was
80 years younger an’ I’d give him a crack
in the eye. Go on out of this! Get!”
“Don’t I get me expenses?” asked the
aggrieved Uncle imprudently.
Jimmy lifted his fist, let it fall again, and
turned away; but the hand of Denny Den-
een was out of control. It closed on Uncle’s
collar.
“Mad little loafer wit’ the white lace
curtains on your face! Out o’ this! Out
o’ me sight or vou’ll meet Denny Deneen,
Jay Pee. in his official capashity. An’ t’wont
be for fragrancy you’ll be aristed, but for
murder of a cow an’ a picnic.”
Denny released Uncle, who still saw every
man but himself in the wrong; and as the
old man slunk away he threw at his per-
secutor a parting justification.
“It’ll be a damgood lesson to the cow,
anyway,” said Uncle.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Silence is Leaden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT began quite simply. There may have
been previous cases among people
of no importance, but nobody heard
anything about them. When it became
public, however, that William Jones Roberts,
Prime Minister of Australia, had been struck
dumb in the middle of a speech of national
importance, people began to shake their
heads over the instability of the modern
nervous constitution. Evening newspapers
published the reassuring report of a special-
ist: it was a quite usual form of aphasia—
or amnesia—consequent upon nerve strain.
A month of complete rest would put the
Prime Minister upon his feet again, ready
to resume his interrupted oratorical flight.
Nor did the professional pessimists see any-
thing but an ironical freak of fate in the
following morning’s news item. It was
headed “A Remarkable Coincidence,” and
announced that the eminent specialist had
himself been smitten by the speech-robbing
amnesia—or aphasia—which he had, a few
hours previously, so blithely diagnosed. The
coincidence was striking, but the reason was
not far to seek. Each of the victims was a
man of high mentality accustomed to brain-
work of a particularly taxing kind : each had
been overworking; and each having borne
great stress during the war had not allowed
a period for recuperation thereafter. A
staid morning daily ran an article on “Not-
able Coincidences,” and people promptly for-
got the matter.
That is, until the next morning, when
the daily papers reported a number of simi-
lar cases, adding the cynical comment that
aphasia—or amnesia—seemed to be replac-
ing appendicitis in favor as a fashionable
disease. It Avas left t,o the evening papers,
when publishing a further list of victims,
to draw a startling inference. Under the
caption “Is Aphasia Catching?” one of
them directed attention to the fact that the
reported cases (norv numbering over a
score) could be traced in trvo chains of asso-
ciation, the links of each leading back to
one or other of the original cases. The
second evening paper asked in large type,
“Is there danger of amnesia endemic?” and
elaborated a similar theme. Side by side
with reported interviews, in which eminent
pathological authorities ridiculed the idea
that a functional nervous disorder could be-
come endemic, a morning paper printed a
half-column list of further cases.
That was a Saturday, and on the Monday
morning no doubt remained. An eminent
and popular divine, in the midst of a de-
nunciation of a godless generation, had sud-
denly found himself waving surplus-adorned
arms in a petrifying silence. The members
of a motor party, rallying one of their num-
ber on his sulky silence, had in turn found
themselves in like condition. Dumb panic
presided at hundreds of breakfast tables.
The newspapers rose to an occasion that
placed them in a position of unusual power.
It could no longer be denied that dumbness
had become virulently endemic, but the pro-
babilities were that the condition would
prove ephemeral. Since no physical symp-
toms had as yet manifested themselves, it
was assumed that no more serious results
need be anticipated. Meanwhile puzzled
pathologists were working day and night in
an effort to isolate the bacteria presumably
responsible for the condition. In a loader
gallantly headed “Business As Uusual” the
older of the two morning papers pleaded for
patience, sanity and temporary adaptation
to inescapable conditions of discomfort. Sig-
nificantly, telegrams announcing similar con-
ditions in other States were not. featured.
It Avas noteAvorthy that the papers did not
appear on the city streets until after S
o'clock. Co-ordination between men bereft
of speech is not easy.
The evening newspapers on that fateful
Monday were notable for several reasons.
Full-page advertisements of seribbling-
blocks and writing-tablets constituted an un-
usually large section of the advertising; an
announcement that Cabinet had decided to
rule by newspaper promulgation until de-
bate became possible, Avith strange details
of a Parliamentary division in which a
blackboard had played the part of mover
and seconder: a curt notice to parents that
schools would be closed for the present;
announcements of the closing of theatres
offset by the triumphant declarations of the
picture-shows that their programmes Would
be maintained and enriched; an article in
which the Council of Churches pleaded for
“universal silent prayer, that this terrible
visitation be lifted from us” —the word
“silent” was so obviously supererogatory
that grim smiles twisted many lips; and
leading articles pleading for patience with-
out panic. Altogether a noteworthy day's
issue.
Featured next morning in one newspaper
(it appeared at 30 o'clock; its rival at 30.30)
was a two-column article incredibly headed
“He Can Still Speak.” The man in question
Avas a Richmond cobbler, and it cannot be
said that he used his unique gift to advant-
age ; yet every precious though ungrammati-
cal phrase in a 20-minutes’ interview Avas
duly and solemnly recorded. Ignoring, at
last, the pretence of business that no one
save newspapers and banks (the latter grow-
ing daily more timorous) attempted to
carry on, the same paper published a leading
article entitled “Thank God for Books!”
one sentence of which read : “If the incredible
should happen and the affliction of dumbness
prove permanent, at least we can be sure
that our civilisation Avill prove permanent
also. Thanks to books, our children will
inherit the rich culture which human speech
has alone made possible, and it may be that
their silent wisdom will exceed that of the
babbling generations of mankind.”
The despairing comment of an evening daily
on that fatuously optimistic leader precipi-
tated the final panic. “How shall our child-
ren inherit anything?” it asked. “Without
speech Ave cannot teach them to read, and
our books will be as valuable to them as an
Assyrian cuneiform inscription to an Egyp-
tian fellah of the present year of grace.”
After that, chaos. A run on the banks.
Railway traffic had been speedily disorganised
and suburban dwellers tramped to towm.
1 )umb people thrusting pieces of paper upon
harassed-looking clerks had formed queues
so long and so impatient that rioting had re-
sulted. Grim, dumb ferocity crushed at the
closed doors of disorganised banks. Baton-
charges by police were directed by gesticulat-
ing superiors. Shopbreaking and hooliganism
became rampant. The work of the courts
was necessarily suspended. Then came a
rush to the hills, to the bush, to the sea. by
the better social elements. Security of Gov-
ernment. of finance, of property, of life, dis-
appeared. Anarchy! Inarticulate ferocity,
bred of fear! Finally, a city deserted, except
for the lawless few, slowdy evolving a hideous
pornocracy amid broken windows, tarnished
splendors, and bestial orgies!
It was seven years later, in a waste of
bush, that an almost naked man. bronzed by
the sun and lean with years of precarious
living, stooped to claw with his long nails
in the ground for edible roots. Finding noth-
ing, he set off at a bent, shambling run for
more promising country. A root tripping
him he fell heavily, and there broke from his
hirsute lips the croaking word:
“Damnation!”
Dazedly he sat up; dazedly he looked at
the sky; at the surrounding bush; at his
toes, and back at the sky. Then in an awed
wdiisper, William Jones Roberts confided his
secret to the day.
“I spoke!” he wdiispered incredulously,
“Dear God ! I spoke!”

The Best Time of
Your Life
Opinions differ as to which is the best time
of one’s life. Some think childhood’s days
are brightest, some think the early twenties,
while others consider the mature years of
middle life the most agreeable.
On one point, however, all are agreed. The
best time of life must be when your health
is at its best.
Many people say that the best time of their
lives began when they commenced to take
Beechain’s Pills. This famous remedy gave
relief from disorders such as biliousness,
constipation, sick headache or flatulence,
which had to some extent darkened their
lives, and it brought them new health, new
energy and a new joy of living.
