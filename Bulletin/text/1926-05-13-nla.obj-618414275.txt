When the Days
work is over
It is pleasant to relax when the
day’s work is over and to listen
to your favourite records in the
cool of the evening, but you
don’t want to be confined to one
room, or even to the house
for your music, do you ?
You want a Decca. Then you can
carry it quite easily on to the
verandah, into the garden, or as
far afield as you may choose,
there to enjoy to the full its loud,
clear and perfect tone, which is
not even surpassed by any of the
big ‘stay-at-home’ phonographs.

Smear lightly
over face
Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer? Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVEX,
the natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
FREE SAMPLES
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look
twice as young. No after lotions are
required when using Shavex, for it is a
skin food as' well.

The Novelette Rehabilitated
For so long has the novelette been the
j ireserve of pot-boiling scribblers that one
uses the term, in relation to narrative art,
with diffidence. Automatically it conjures up a
vision of lifted eyebrows and curling lips. For
the reading public, through long association of
the long-short story with its sister of the
paper covers and delightfully ludicrous illus-
trations, has come to regard the novelette,
naturally enough, as the arena where the
wicked peer chases innocent Polly and im-
pregnable scullery-maids become duchesses.
It is the cardinal misfortune of the novel-
ette that, until Galsworthy, no great author
had seriously accepted it as a medium of
his art. The preference almost invariably
was given either to the protracted complexity
and wide scope of the full-length novel or
else to the crackling brilliancy of the short
story.
What is the essential character of the
novelette? Briefly it may be described as
a compromise between the divergent tenden-
cies of novel and short story. It combines
iu modified forms some of the best qualities
of both these great branches of fiction. From
the novel it has borrowed width and depth
of scope, complexity of plot and character,
completeness of atmosphere. Compactness,
unity of effect, intensity of action it owes
to the short story. Of course, it is at once
apparent that these qualities must emerge
from the process of transplantation in a less
vigorous, somewhat vitiated form. The
novelette is susceptible neither of the epic
grandeur which is sometimes reached by the
novel nor of the eiiigrammatic sparkle of
the short'story. Its artistic value must be
sought elsewhere. It is in unity of effect
expanded to the utmost limit, in the inten-
sity of the short story prolonged to half the
length of a novel, that the novelette excels
its progenitors. The short story is too brief
to give that rigid certainty of reality which
is essential to high narrative art; its scope
is too narrow. The novel, on the other hand,
is like a Chinese play—so long that it can
be read only in snatches, thus sacrificing
unity of effect. The importance of this last
quality is often underestimated. The human
mind is essentially single in its receptive
functions, capable of receiving and digest-
ing only one impression at a time. It is all-
important, therefore, in order that the im-
pact of the artist’s inner fundamental con-
ception upon the mind of his audience may
be the more powerful and inevitable, that
every work of art should be a unity, its
component parts all tending towards a com-
mon point, as the radii of a circle all tend
to its centre. And amongst the most harass-
ing difficulties which confront the good novel-
ist is the problem of moulding a long,
rambling narrative of 70.000 or 100,000
words into a close unity. In most cases he
is unsuccessful and, if his novel is good, it
is good in spite of itself. The length of the
novelette (from 15.000 to 40,000 words)
naturally obviates this difficulty.
Altogether, the novelette is far more
worthy of serious artistic acceptance than
most people think. Its first rehabilitator has
already appeared. John Galsworthy, who
is flourishing exceedingly, has essayed eight
or nine tales in this medium, of which *tlie
three longest are authentic masterpieces.
Whoever would judge of the possibilities of
the novelette should read “The Indian Sum-
mer of a Forsyte,” “The Stoic” and “The
Apple-tree.” Moreover, only in the short
stories is the happy side of Galsworthy’s
character more completely revealed than in
these works. Gone is the vivisector of “The
Forsyte Saga,” and in his 'place is Gals-
worthy the pagan, Galsworthy the epicurean
philosopher, with a more than Hellenic zest
for the beautiful things of life. “The Indian
Summer of a Forsyte” is an exquisitely deli-
cate study of the last incursion of Beauty
upon the soul of fine old Jolyon Forsyte, who
only in the last years had attained that sub-
mergence of self in the perception of beauty
for which he had wished since the earliest
years of his life. In “The Stoic,” Gals-
worthy lias done that which of all things he
does supremely well—-he has delineated the
character of an old, old man, full of sinful
years and tawny port, a rake in youth and a
gourmand in age, unscrupulous and overbear-
ing, yet withal a gentleman and indomitable
fighter. And the scene in which, knowing
the game to be up, his creditors about to
kill, he makes his last, solitary feast, eating
of forbidden things, and with the fiery
warmth of aged brandy still in his throat,
sinks down into death—what a scene that
is, and how strange the light that surrounds
the magnificent old sinner! “The Apple-
tree,” a tragically ironic story of one who
rejected the gift of “the tCyprian,” the god-
dess of love, and the vengeance she sent upon
him, is cast in a beautiful form, of which
Galsworthy’s suggestive, subtly modulated
style is the mould. Indeed, in the whole
English literature there are few more beau-
tiful prose idylls than the first part of that
tale.
LIONEL T. LUXTON.
“Tom of Bedlam”
When the brilliant, unhappy Ernest
Dowson wrote his fine sonnet “To One in
Bedlam,” in which he suggests the beautv
and nobility that may make up the other
side of what we call madness, he was most
likely inspired by an obscure seventeenth-cen-
tury song. The name of Bethlehem Hospital,
opened as a home for lunatics in the previous
century, was mumbled by the populace into
“Bedlam.” Certain of these lunatics, harm-
less enough, were set free and let roam the
countryside, where they called at the wakes
and fairs and begged alms. A weird lot,
these poor vagrants. Their moods and their
expressions were strange, and their more
level-headed fellows on the roads shunned
them. Often they wore metal badges on
their arms which gave them authority to beg
in public. Others would crown themselves
with weeds and flowers.
Among the popular airs of the time were
several dealing with these beggars. One,
unfortunately anonymous, has come down to
us and been the inspiration of many writers.
This particular “mad song” can be traced
back to an anthology published in 1615 and
called “Giles Earle’s Song Book.” Subse-
quently it was reprinted in a miscellany of
wit and drollery, first in 1661 and again in
1682, each version differipg slightly from its
predecessor. The unknown writer conjures
up unearthly images of a weird and powerful
beauty. The notable verses took the fancy
of the late Mrs. Meynell. who included them
m her anthology, “The Flower of the Mind,”
marking the authorship as “anonymous.”
Among the most striking lines are these: —
I know more than Apollo:
For oft when he lies sleeping,
I behold the stars
\t mortal, wars
And the rounded welkin weeping.
The moon’s my constant mistress,
And the lonely owl my morrow:
The flaming drake
And the night-crow make
Me music, to my sorrow.
With a heart of furious fancies,
Whereof I am commander,
With a burning spear,
And a horse of air.
To the wilderness I wander;
Wi tli. a knight of ghosts and shadows
I summoned am to tourney
Ten leagues beyond
The wide world’s end ;
Methinks it is no journey !
Dowson, too, had an inkling of the dreams
and splendors that pierce like lightning the
chaos of a mind diseased. In his sonnet he
strikes the same note, and asks, speaking of
the inhabitants of that “dull world” outside
the prison bars,
....Know they what dreams divine
Lift his long, laughing reveries like enchanted wine,
And make his melancholy germane to the stars?
Mrs. Meynell’s discovery led to the publica-
tion the following year (1898) of the won-
derful poem by her protege Francis Thomp-
son, which stands to-day as the perfected
“Mad Song of Tom of Bedlam.” Thompson,
who knew, the terrors of a hag-ridden mind,
was the very man to get from the old, almost-
forgotten verses whatever of truth they
possessed. He took 25 lines from them
(there were but few more), built on and
around them a further 55 of his own, and
published the whole in The Dome, a literary
quarterly of the time, now defunct. The
new song—not, unfortunately, included in
Thompson’s collected works—is a poem of
genius, with a horror and beauty equal to
anything in the original
The shadows plot against me,
And lie in ambush for me;
The' stars conspire
And a net of tire
Have set for my faring o’er me.
I ride by ways that are not,
With a trumpet sounding to me
From goblin lists,
And the maws of mists
Are opened to undo me.
I hear on imminent cities
The league-long watches armsd,
Dead cities lost
Ere the moon grew a ghost
Phantasmal, viewless, charmed.
As a burst and blood-blown insect
Cleaves to the wall it dies on,
The smeared sun
Doth cloth upon
A heaven without horizon.
I dare not but be drcadless
Because all things to dread are;
With a trumpet blown
Through the mists alotic
From a land where the lists of the dead are.
Other men have used a line here and
there, but mostly in a. casual way. Rudyard
Kipling has several at the top of Chapter 15
of “The Light That Failed.” Edgar Allan
Poe quotes the four lines beginning “With a
heart of furious fancies” at the opening of
his story about Hans Pfaalh Somewhere
in Scott’s “Heart of Midlothian” Maggie
Wildfire sings a verse. Going back to the
days > of Ben Jonson, we come across a vari-
ant in his masque, “The Gipsies Metamor-
phosed.” The gipsy’s vow runs:—
The fairy beam upon you.
The stars to glister on you ;
A moon of light
In the noon of night
Till the firedrake hath o'ergo tic you!
This air is, of course, familiar. It cannot
be doubted that Herrick used the fragment
when he wrote his delightful “Nightpiece to
Julia”
Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,
The shooting stars attend thee;
And the elves also,
Whose little eyes glow
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.
Let not the dark thee cumber ;
What though the moon does slumber ?
The stars of the night
Will lend thee their light
Like tapers clear without number.
James_ Thomson (he who was known as
“8.V.”) quotes four stanzas in the course
of his essay on “The Poems of William
Blake” ; while only recently, in his “Memoirs
of a Midget,” Walter de la Mare makes a
young girl recite the lines as they appeared
in “The Flower of the Mind.”
“The Mad Song of Tom of Bedlam” is
full of possibilities for illustration. But.
apart from several drawings of a, crude kind
in E. G. O’Donoghue’s “Story of Bethlehem
Hospital,” the only ones that would appear
to have been published are by Norman Lind-
say. In the days when he was more absorbed
in life and its illustration than in meta-
physics, he depicted poor Tom in a series
of pen-drawings and etchings which breathe
the very spirit of the madman’s crowded
existence. These illustrations are based-
mostly on Thompson’s extension of the ori-
ginal song, wherein Tom speaks of “a wench
of wanton beauties” whom he blames for his
undoing.

It is doubtful whether moye than one in
ten of the population of an industrialized
country has a sense of the ,-esthetic; and
the other nine are not aware of being short
of the organ. The average citizen receives
his house from the hands of the speculative
builder, with wall-cupboards and standard
mantelpieces complete ; and even the layout
of the garden paths are orthodoxly adum-
brated. If a back number of an archi-

er’s hands, the home may be what is known
as artistic. The housewife proceeds to fur-
nish it from the stock the Afghan hawker
brings to the back door, and the “objects de
vercher” the Yankee drummer brings to the
front In due course the mansion becomes
a museum representative of all the civilised
world and a good deal of the savage.
The Chinese mandarin who sacrifices to
the god of Agriculture arrayed in a silken
crown from the looms of Soochow and a billy-
cock hat from Birmingham justly invites
our laughter. How vastly he would be
amused in turn if lie could penetrate an
Australian home and see the male working
robes of China used as an opera-cloak; the
kilts of the Javanese coolie as a tablecloth;
the South Sea Islander’s taro-basket as a
fruit-bowl; Persian wall-tapestries as floor
coverings; Tibetan rosaries as women’s neck-
laces ! The fact is that since men ceased
to feel pots and pans with their fingers in
the process of manufacture, their minds have
ceased to have much feeling for the fitting
and the beautiful. Nor are princes, Parlia-
ments and people aware of the deficiency.
When John Shirlow, who has done more
than any man in liis etchings to preserve
the vanishing charms of Melbourne, ven-
tures to protest that “Eat more fruit—Don’t
be a coot” or some such slogan plastered on
the gateway to the city is an offence against
good taste, and the valiant Mr. Clapp replies
that the practice has led to an increase of
railway revenue, further observations on the
matter are lost in a roar of public applause
for Mr. Clapp.
The progressive uglification of his environ-
ment is, in fact, so thoroughly endorsed by
the citizen that it has become automatic and
routinary. The councillor who would protest
against a bit of natural foreshore being
“improved” by a straight concrete wall de-
corated at exadt intervals by lamp-posts,
alternating with Pinus insignis, has not been
born these 50 years; and if there are any
citizens who consider that the subdivision of
a residential district is not the exclusive
business of a clerk armed with a ruler and
pencil, they keep their counsel. And yet the
aesthetic sense is not an aristocratic mono-
poly. There was a time when it flourished
amongst the masses of many countries. The
national costume of the Javanese peasant is
in faultless taste; a Toorak banker would be
proud to own a mansion as chastely beauti-
ful as a country pub in Nippon. Even this
hastily-improvised civilisation has had the
faculty. If anyone wants to lay a wreath
on a memorial to an Australian aesthetic
sense now unhappily in its grave, let him go
and look at Appin or Stroud (N.S.W.), or
the old coaching inn in process of demolition
in Flinders-lane, Melbourne. Then, for

Color and Interior Decoration, by Basil
Ionides (Country Life, London) doesn t
appear to think. It sets out elaborate tables
of various decorative schemes. Anybody fol-

a home in faultless style. It really aims at
standardising the aesthete.
M.G.S.
The Man Who Pays the Piper
The business man with a big income is at
a discount. To the multitude the system
which he represents is robbery. Political
agitation is solidly against his class. Even
people who accept the idea of buying and
selling as a proper occupation are uncertain
whether great wealth acquired in this way
can be considered a creditable achievement.
There are in England at the present time
10,270 persons “in enjoyment” of an income
of £lO,OOO or more. From this number has
come forward the head of the publishing
house of Ernest Benn and Co. in defence of
his kind. In The Confessions of a Capitalist
(Hutchinson; Angus and Robertson) lie has
laid bare his doings, and examines them
critically in the light of theory. He admits
to an income of £lO,OOO, a couple of motor-
cars, a luxurious home, and responsibility
for about 2000 wage-slaves. He started m
business at 16, earning ss. a week in his
father’s office. At 19 he went out selling
space” in one of his father’s trade-journals.
At 24 he managed to raise sufficient funds
to purchase a small monthly, the Haboware
Trade Journal, which had an annual gross
revenue of £lBOO. He worked it through two
years of loss; tq-day it is one of the big
trade weeklies of the world, with a gross
revenue of £70,000 per annum. Side by side
with this has grown the publishing house
of Ernest Benn and Co.
One of the trade journals he controls is
subscribed for at the rate of 255. for 52
copies. In return Benn and Co. give paper
worth 50s. before any matter has been
put on it at all. The same subscriber
receives in postage-stamps upon the wrapper
the equivalent of 10s. in the course of a
year. During the same period wages aver-
age £3 per subscriber. On that transaction
Benn and Co. lose £4 15s. for every sub-
scriber. The other half of the transaction
is with the advertisers. The advertiser pays
£lO for an announcement which, if issued by
circular, would cost about £3O to reach the
same people. The subscriber is satisfied;
the advertiser is satisfied; Benn and Co.
make a profit; and the trade press increases
the industrial prosperity of the country.
Benn is “amused” to hear Socialists hold
up the. Post Office as a model instance of
the blessings to be enjoyed under State trad-
ing. In Fleet-street they collect the news of
two hemispheres in a few hours, put it into
readable form, print it and distribute it
over the country. For a penny you can
have with your breakfast full information of
the happenings of the world up to midnight.
If the Fleet-street; worker wants to send a
few lines to his sister in Bedford he must
write it, pay the P.M.O. 1 Id. and put it in
the appropriate box before the appropriate
hour in order to get it to his sister in Bed-
ford half an hour after the story from China
has been received, printed, packed, distri-
buted and delivered at the same address for
one-third of the price!
Benn is convinced of the unsoundness of
sharing profits with the wage-earners. He
practises profit-sharing, nevertheless, as a
gesture and a sop to “the psychological and
ethical influences which are part ot the pi o-
blem of industrial success.” The road he
would follow is to make the worker become
a capitalist. Some £36,000 worth of shares
in Benn and Co. are held by persons work-
ing in the business. ,
From the statistics and writings ot the
Italian economist and mathematician \n-
fredo Pareto, Benn draws his chief inspira-
tion. He suggests—“with great, trepidation
—that there has been something in the
nature of a conspiracy to suppress lareto.
Pareto’s “law” is that there must be degrees
of wealth. We all go up and down together.
Economic equality is a scientific impossi-
bility. To raise the lower grades you must
also raise the higher. A hundred years ago
the population of Great Britain was
8,000,000, and the richest man was not
worth more than £lO,OOO a year; and
the standard of living of the poor was
incomparably lower than it is to-day. in
Russia, conversely, the dispossession ot the
wealthy should, according to the Pareto for-
mula, be followed by the physical disappear-
ance of a much greater number ot persons
lower down the scale. And that is what
actually happened. .
Sir Ernest Benn derives Ins income from
a turnover of £400,000. He pays away to
workers and others £390,000, and of the
remaining £lO,OOO the Chancellor of the
Exchequer takes half. Therefore 3d. in the
£ is all that Sir Ernest gets. He distributes
wages on a far lower expense ratio than old-
age pensions are distributed. The dole costs
far more to hand out over the counters ot
labor exchanges. . ,
This is the sort of person against whom
both socialist and communist propaganda is
directed. One leaves his book with the
feeling that if the other 10,269 super-taxable
people in England could make even half as
good a defence of their position, the case
for capitalism would be complete.
GERALD DILLON.
Esperanto
Gusts of wind have been blowing at Uni-
versal Languages. Correspondents have
voiced their opinions mostly on the assump-
tion that Esperanto aspires to be a uni-
versal” language. It neither claims to be
nor aims at becoming a “universal lan-
guage. The idea of a “universal language
may be quite commendable, but is utterly inv-
possible to carry out. What nation would
be prepared to abandon its most treasured
possession—its language—merely for the
sake of gratifying a glorious Utopian ideal t
Whether that language be English, Frencn
or Esperanto matters little. It is the pnn-
ciple that is involved.
Esperanto is “an international auxiliary
language.” That is to say, it is to function
solely as a secondary' language between
countries of different nationality and speech.
For an Englishman to use Esperanto to an
American would be ridiculous, just as. it
would for a German addressing an Austrian,
or a Frenchman a Belgian. But for inter-
national exchanges no better and more neu-
tral medium could be sought. I hilologists
and rationalists have amply testified to this.
The object is to have Esperanto taught m
schools, universities, commercial colleges, etc.,
throughout the world, in addition to the
mother tongue, thereby enabling a person to
converse or correspond with any other, irrre-
spective of nationality. Is that really so
difficult to enforce, or contrary to national
pride
Just because the daily press does not con-
tain regular references to the language, it is
assumed that Esperanto is dying fast. On
the other hand, were the papers to publish
periodic references, as is done with wireless,
motoring, moving-pictures and other subjects,
the public would feel some compelling in-
terest. As it is, those in search of this par-
ticular knowledge have to go beyond the daily
A week or two ago great publicity was
given to the Rotary movement —the Prime
Minister opened the Melbourne conference:
prominent citizens, coming long distances,
contributed their little bit; editors even
spilled ink on leading articles. And what is
the difference in the aims of Rotary and
Esperanto? Only that the Esperantists are
trying to achieve the same object (a better
understanding, co-operation and peaceful re-
lations) with the aid of a common language;
otherwise the method of action is identical.
Somehow or other it is believed in many
ouarters that Esperanto desires to displace
English, and for that reason publicity is
restricted. I hope, however, to have shown
this to be entirely erroneous. .
During the past 12 months (in fact, ever
since the world regained its equilibrium
after the Great War) Esperanto has received
enormous stimulus from the most varied
influential sources, ranging from educational
and scientific bodies to commercial houses,
the most prominent being radio associations.
The progress has been truly remarkable, yet
all this goes unnoticed by the and
consequently “Esperanto is dying fast.’
A more thorough study of the whole ques
tion would be exceedingly instructive to
those constantlv emphasising the unsuit-
ability of an artificial language for exacting
present-day needs.

School Standards and Birth Control
Is the standard of scholastic aclnevemen.
to-day below that of a couple of generations
ago?' Schools are better, equipment is better,
teachers are better paid and more bight',
ovralified. What, then; is the matter? No
thing some will answer, but the croakings
of the old who have ever seen in the past
perfection, in the present decadence, in the
future death. . , . ,
Unfortunately this question is not raised
by the hopeless old of the weeping pessi-
mist When Alfred Binet invented his
methods of testing intelligence he had no
idea that he had hit upon something which
in a few years would create an army or
patient investigators trying more or less
blindly but still with striking success to meas-
ure lniman intelligence. He little thought that
an army, every man of whom had his mental
value assessed and his place determined under
Binet’s directions, would appear on his coun-
try’s soil to help her to victory when his
body had gone back to the clay those stran-
gers defended. But so it happened, and
already the literature of mental measure-
meat has grown to undreamt-of dimensions;
its methods and operations have overflowed
the school, extended to professional and in-
dustrial life and the study of social tenden-
cies. An English schoolmaster, Dr. Brad-
ford, concerning himself only with the ques-
tion as it affects the classroom, comes to the
conclusion, after reviewing the work of Eng-
lish and American investigators as well as
his own, that the present school standards
will have to be lowered because the intelli-
gence of schoolboys sinks to a lower level
with each generation. This occurs because
people with high intelligence quotients (as
determined by Binet methods) have small
families (as determined by statistics), and
people with low intelligence levels have large
families. Unless this social trend is cor-
rected the result, will be the gradual sub-
mergence and final disappearance of higher-
intellect types in the sea of mediocrity and
moronism.
It will be at once objected that clever
people often marry dullards; there is an old
superstition about men of great mental gifts
“falling” (as the Americans put it, and as
Adam no doubt understood it) for butterfly
ladies of mental thistledown; but most of
these “Princess” novelette superstitions have
fallen on times of disrespect, disbelief and
repudiation. Marriage nowadays, as at all
times, is, in the main, determined by en-
vironment, occupation, physical and mental
likings and so on. No man or maid ever
loved stupidity just because it was stupid.
And. anyhow, there is no hope of escape
from the shrieking of- statistics. Dr. Brad-
ford does not discuss whether present-day
school standards are lower than those of the
past; but he calculates tliat the dullards,
who now outnumber the higher types by four
to one, will in a few generations of cheer-
fully, if dully, begetting their kind out-
number them by 200 to 1. That is not a
rosy prospect for the pedagogue of the
future. And if there is any validity or near-
trutli in Dr. Bradford’s findings it is a terri-
fying prospect for any nation.
Marie Stopes has many bright ideas about
birth-control. She, no doubt, would advo-
cate teaching the foolish ones who have
children to stop it and imitate the high-
powered intellects. But it is very doubtful
whether they would listen.
R. O’FARRELL.
A Satchel of Books
Cancelled Love, by C. N. Williamson (Methuen).
One of the infinite variants player! on the eternal
triangle. All very heated and melodramatic. Mrs.
Williamson in old days did healthier work.
Ireland and Her Three English-made Gods, by
Elizabeth McSweeney. “There will never be peace
on this earth while England lays claim to one inch
of Irish soil,” is the burden of this book. There cer-
tainly will not so long as the spirit of the writer
is kept alive.
The Isle of Pheasants, by E. M. O’R. Dickey (Duck-
worth). Described as “Out of the frivolous pan into
the passionate fire,” and the summary is apt. As
one of its characters remarks, “Those who condescend
tc< act as human beings I don’t want,” and readers
who feel that way will enjoy this novel.
The Australian Museum Magazine. The quarterly
number contains, among much interesting matter, a
description of the Ravi or Papuan club house which
is one of the most conspicuous among recent addi-
tions to the exhibits at the Museum. “It brings
before the citizens,” says a writer in the magazine,
“a glimpse of stone-age man and his doings.”
The Devil’s Henchmen, by John Aldrey (Methuen).
Captain Tony Netherley, with a distinguished com-
pany, loses control of his air-liner and comes to
grief in Afghanistan. Through a cave and a tunnel
he is carried by rescuers into a land of the past.
There he meets a lovely maiden, a priestess at the
Temple of Isis, and after many pages of adventure
all ends well with the significant words ‘ Myrtis, my
beloved! ”
The Crimson West, by Alex. Philip (Sampson Low).
It becomes necessary to state the simple fact that
a certain person’s interference with a gang was un-
wise, and in this book it is done in the words:
“That guy was a mut to flash his poke in front ot
that gang*.” For those who like that sort of thing
this book is just the sort of thing they will like.
Common of Angels, by Dorothy lYßeekett Terrell
(Duckworth). What was common of the angels of
the Victorian era, is rather uncommon of the maids
of to-day. Giles Mallory, an artist, goes in quest
of beauty and ultimately finds his happiness with
a mate of the comfortable sort. A clean book with
a theological tang that will hurt nobody and interest
some.
The, Whispering Canyon, by John Mersereau (E.
J. Clode). Back from the war, Bob Cameron makes
track for the home in the big-tree country in Cali-
fornia where he had left his kin, only to find it
wrecked and his father murdered. The story then
turns into wild adventure in the struggle to win
back the property ravished by an enemy. To his aid
comes the girl necessary to all stories. It goes with
a rattle.
Au Anthology of Recitations, compiled by Percy
Cross Standing‘(John Lane). The art of professional
reciting, if not lost, has been on the wane for years
—and more’s the pity. In the old days it was not
unusual for notable actors, such as Walter Mont-
gomery, to step from the stage to the platform and
give an evening of recitations. Now the recitation
is practically confi-.- d to private gatherings and
charity benefits. This collection of prose and verse
is the material for such occasions and covers a wide
range, from Shakspeare to Rupert Brooke.
education. The neatly produced and well edited
monthly organ of the N. S. Wales Public School
Teachers’ Federation. “Until we teachers,” it de-
clares, “realise that science in some form should be
a compulsory part of every child’s education, we
shall be open to the criticism of Caldwell Cook,
that the modern schoolmaster is a man who draws
aside with his pupils into a pleasant byway to discuss
the past; and lets the urgent problems of modern
world go by unheeded.” No echo of old Kentucky
about that!
Astronomy of To-day, by the Abbe Th. Moreaux
(Methuen). An interesting statement of the present
outlook on astronomical questions. Many unsolved
problems are touched upon, among them “Is Mars
Inhabited?” The Abbe inclines to the Noes. He
even doubts whether the planet is intersected by
irrigation canals. At best they are but irregular
lines of complex structure produced by natural
causes. Many phenomena on the planet point to
the existence of an atmosphere, but it is not such as
human beings as we know them could exist in;
“the pressure of the atmosphere is too low for water
to remain in a liquid state, and the very plants
must be of a rudimentary type.” The general con-
clusion is that Mars is in a condition between that
of the earth and that of the moon. “Slowly, very
slowly, time does its work, and insensibility over-
takes* the planet as a consequence of the cold which
sooner or later puts every world to sleep and gently
leads it along the road tewleath.”
“Top Circle” : Hattie Knight urges that, like Eden
Phillpotts with his “Farmer’s Wife,” the Australian
dramatist should write quietly and simply of the
life about him; “and then,” she cries, “the whole
world will acclaim his work.” The experience of
Eden Phillpotts himself would hardly bear this out.
For many years he has been a well-known and much-
published author; he has been a well-known and
often-produced dramatist, having a good acquaintance
with the stage and its managers ; and, yet, when he
had written his “Farmer’s Wife” he had to carry
it about for a dozen years before a manager would
produce it.

Under the Moon.
The moon, the sea and the quiet earth
Mingle as in a dream of death,
As I lie under the dark boughs
In which the sleeping birds have breath-
Like fays that in the Lethean air
Have slipt into a nunnery there,
And fold their hearts up till they dance
To music in the Morn’s romance.
Beneath the boughs I lie: how still
It all is, mystically fair —
E’en like a lovely woman dead
With moonlight in her tangled hair!
The creeping sea and wandering moon
And my own heart are so in tune,
I would like this be laid at last
When every hope and fear is past.

Paradox.
There is a song too dear
For my heai't’s prison
Now you and joy are here
And the dusk bunis amber-clear,
With a moon unrisen.
There is a song too gay
For a glad soul’s singing. ,
Needs must the sky be grey
To brood on the dreams for aye
Homelessly winging.
Only the bitter heart
Knows the far wonder,
Watching dreams drift apart—
Seas with nor star nor cliax’t
Whelming them under.
Sweet with the sweetest song,
My soul shall hearken
Some eve when the world’s wrong
Tolls like an iron gong
And the skies darken.
Thus shall my dreams, through vain
Sorrowing, after
To some lost joy attain,
Triumph, with lips of pain,
Singing God’s laughter!

Ti-tree Aisles.
When heat-waves shimmer to and fro,
How good it is to be
Where elfin aisles of ti-trec go,
Dusted with powdery blossom-snow,
Down-winding to the sea!
From out this twisted window-sill,
See, faint and far away,
Where sun and shade alternate spill
The grape-bloom on the purple hill
Beyond the lazy bay.
And sweet it is to heart and brain
To linger here at whiles,
Where slants the fretted sunbeam-rain,
To let the fancy rove again
Beyond the blue sea-miles,
Beyond the far horizon’s maze,
The last long whitening wake,
To some lost dream of other days,
Of higher hopes and wider ways
For some lost sorrow’s sake.
The bird-notes from the leafy deeps,
Where bright the gay waves gleam,
Through tangled glades and sq<Jdeu steeps,
Fall on a drowsy woi'ld that sleeps—
And even I must dream.
Hearing such airy music start
In woodland stave and rune,
The pipes' of Pan are in my heart,
Partly of fantasy and part
Of golden afternoon.
The olden love-lights and the trust
Come drifting home • again,
Untarnished still by moth or rust.
Smelling as sweet as summer dust
Watered by summer rain.
As sweet as brown boronia bells
What time September goes
Weaving her witchery of spells
Through shining ways where beauty dwells
The pipes my own heart blows.
Such healing comes for hurt and loss
That, happy, I would fain
Ne’er find the path where red roads cross
Beyond the bracken and the moss
To lead me home again !

AN ELECTION BRIBE AND
ITS CONSEQUENCES.
When the Forty-four Hour Week Bill was
going through the N. S. Wales Assembly
there were some open confessions which are
curious to read now that industrial trouble,
of which the very idea was then ridiculed,
has arrived in large quantities. Dunn, the
Minister of Agriculture, said: “I told the
electors of Wammerawa [his rural constitu-
ency] that they would have a 44-hour week,
and I got quite a few votes.” Gosling,
chairman of the Labor party, went further:
The main fight during the elections was on the
shorter working week. Unless the 44-hour week is
introduced this session it will wreck the Labor party,
t would go further —I am thinking of what I am
saying—and say that even if you can prove to me
that the 44-liour week is economically unsound, the
pledge we made on the platform must still be
honored. It was made without the slightest quali-
fication, and there -was no dissimulation.
Gosling is an English immigrant who hasn’t
been long in the country, and if he is a fair
sample of the English Labor politicians with
whom the Baldwin Government has had to
deal, it is obvious that Baldwin couldn’t
have prevented the general strike to which
he has refused to surrender. The 44-hour-
week pledge was unqualified, as Gosling
Bays, but that shows there was dissimula-
tion. Though preparations were in hand
for the Federal campaign when Lang was
electioneering, the employees in rural indus-
tries were not told that they were to he
excluded from the Forty-four Hour Week
Bill in the interests of the Federal Labor
party. And though tens of thousands of
other unionists were working under Com-
monwealth awards, they were not warned
that the State legislation promised would
certainly be challenged in the High Court, or
of the position in which they would find
themselves if it there broke down. It was
all-important to get votes, and the Labor
party got the votes, and the salaries, etc.,
of office. N. S. Wales has got the large
quantities of trouble.
* # * *
Garden, secretary of tiie N. S. Wales
Trades and Labor Council, was a Commu-
nist candidate for Sydney when Labor poli-
ticians were scattering all manner of elec-
tion bribes. A pretence was made of re-
pudiating him, but a week or two after his
failure at the polls he bobbed up as a repre-
sentative of N. S. Wales Labor at an Adel-
aide conference attended by S. Aus. Labor
members, and there were no protests from
the Sydney heads of “the movement” He
now figures as the deader of the strike for
44 hours, which strike has involved 4000 or
5000 workers directly, and four or five times
the number indirectly; and in that capacity
he is in the closest touch with Baddeley,
Minister for Less-Labor and Strangled In-
dustry. That bewildered gentleman has been
going around saying that he is “watching
developments,” that “the public can rest
assured that he is doing his best,”
that “the responsibility is on Mr. Brtjce
to move as quickly as possible in
the matter,” and other weak and foolish
things. After consultation with Baddeley
no doubt, Garden informed the Prime Min-
ister, by telegram, that a “crisis” impended,
inasmuch as the owners “threatened a lock-
out," adding, with characteristic impudence,
“Sydney Labor Council calls on you to
convene compulsory conference immediately
to avert threatened upheaval.” The Prime
Minister should have replied that he refused
to have any dealings with an imported
communist who aims at overthrowing Aus-
tralian institutions and who has been
actively associated with one mischievous
strike after another ever since his return
from Moscow. He might have gone on to
say that he had other States and sections to
think of besides N. S. Wales and its dis-
satisfied unionists, and that the “industrial
upheaval” could be averted by those union-
ists observing the terms of their Federal
awards, as their branches in other States
were doing, and by calling their guilty and in-
capable State Labor Government to account.
But the Priminister's urbanity prevents him
from rising to occasions when plain speech
would do a world of good. He contented him-
self with mildly pointing out that the confer-
ence _ so imperiously demanded could settle
nothing, and that a meeting of Common-
wealth and State Ministers, which was also
suggested, would only drag more politics
into a business to which politics should never
have been introduced. Presently he offered
to refer the whole question of working
hours, for inquiry and report, to the Full
Arbitration Court, which is about to be re-
constituted, the present tribunal being on the
point of dissolution.
* * * *
Meanwhile Justice Powers had caused it
to be announced that applications for a re-
duction of working hours would be heard by
the present Full Arbitration Court before
it passed out. This statement was obviously
published without reference to Deputy-
Presidents Quick and Webb, and those
gentlemen having signified that they ob-
jected, and having refused to send on par-
ticular applications to the Full Court, the
President intimated that the Full Court
would not act. His manner of doing so gave
offence to union secretaries (they certainly
had some reason for being offended), and those
who had prepared cases for the Full Court
were subsequently told that they might sub-
mit them. What the Full Court will do it
is impossible to say, but in the judg-
ment he delivered in the engineering case
Justice Powers gave the subjoined reasons
for having ordered an increase of working
hours from 44, the award of Higgins, J., to
48 —
In June, 1921, when the Higgins award was made,
the number of unemployed members of the union was
just over 7 JO. Six months later it had increased to
about 1230. Two months after the hours were raised
to 48 per week, the unemployed numbered about 930.
In April, 1923, there were 650; in October, 1923.
less than 350; in May, 1924, about 275. And yet
workers will insist that 44 hours reduces the number
of unemployed. Since May, 1923, the number of
unemployed members of the union was never more
than 400, as against from 700 at the lowest to
1230 at the highest under the award fixing the hours
at 44 a week, although the number of members is
about 1500 more than in June, 1921, when that
award was made.
It is only 18 months since these remarks
were placed on record, and they lead to the
same inevitable conclusion to-day as they
did then.
* * * *
One of the ironies of the situation brought
about by the Lang party’s election bribe and
bull-at-a-gate legislation is that these
Federal-award unionists are, for the most
part, doing more exacting and important
work than thousands of those who have
got the 44-hour week, many of whom
are soft-jobbers. Nevertheless the best advice
that can be given to these 48-hour unionists,
justly irritated, though they may be, is to
respect their engagements until the awards
which they sought which are legally and
morally binding on them, and which are
being observed by their fellow-workers in
four other States, expire. They would like-
wise be well advised to substitute a good
Australian for a Moscow devotee in negoti-
ating with the employers and in preparing
their case for the new Arbitration Court;
well advised also to get rid of the. roaring in-
competents of the Labor party, who are
wholly to blame for their plight.
THE £85,000,000 ROAD SCHEME.
At the transport conference in Melbourne the
Prirainister complained that his Govern-
ment’s offer to give the States £20,000,000,
spread over 10 years, for “the construction
and reconstruction of Federal-aid reads’’ had
been objected to as “an infringement by the
Commonwealth of functions that properly
belong to the States.” He suggested that the
objectors were “misguided constitutionalists,”
and declared that he would be “heartily glad
if we could get rid of all this argument about
‘functions’ when the country as a whole is
faced by an obvious and urgent practical
problem.” Considering the dire results of
dual control in other fields—that of indus-
trial legislation especially—criticism of a
costly plan for extending the thing to a new
domain is quite in order, and the good Bruce
shouldn’t carp at it. Nor are all the critics of
his scheme merely constitutionalists. Some
say they have long contended that the Com-
monwealth Government has been taking too
much money from the taxpayer, and that its
readiness to spend £2,000,000 per annum for
10 years on works for which it is exempt
from responsibility proves it. The idea, it
should be mentioned, is to provide £500,000
p.a. from “existing sources of Commonwealth
revenue” and £1,500,000 p.a. from “new
sources of Commonwealth revenue.” no par-
ticulars of the new sources being given.
* * * *
Another objection is that State Labor
Governments with elections coming on would
use Commonwealth funds for strengthening
their position in doubtful electorates, road-
workers being migratory and Labor-unionists
to a man. Color is lent to this argument by
the eagerness with which the Brisbane Min-
istry accepted the scheme; as soon as it
read the details it telegraphed its willing-
ness to the gratified and unsuspecting Bruce.
This was published on March” 12, and there
was ample time for sending parties of un-
employed to the help of hard-pressed Queens-
land Labor candidates in anticipation of
Commonwealth expenditure for the supple-
mentary rolls did not close until April 9.
The Westralian Labor Government, which
will have to go to the country next April,
and may go in December or January, when
the cockies are struggling with their harvest,
was equally prompt: with its Aye; and it
has since been urging Bruce and Page to
hurry up on the ground that its road pro-
gramme “will be practically completed by
the end of June, and the employment of a
large number of men,” not to mention the
distribution of a large number of votes, “is
in jeopardy.” Westralia’s share of the Com
monwealth grant, which is to be distributed
on a basis of three-fifths population and two-
fifths area, is £384,000 p.a., and even the
half of that amount, judiciously expended,
might make the Jarrah State safe for an
otherwise unsafe Ministry. It is significant
that Labor Governments have induced the
confiding gentlemen on the Federal Treasury
benches to abandon their idea of getting the
whole of the jobs carried out by contract.
That was specified in the original draft, but
it is now provided that, “where the Minister
for the State advises that day labor would
be more economical or expeditious” (and each
Labor Minister will so advise, it being the
policy of his party), every bit of the work
may be done on the day-labor plan. Yet
without firm contracts the Commonwealth
will have no guarantee that it will get the
worth of its £20,000,000 or any part of it.
The position is made worse by a clause per-
mitting the States to borrow the £15,000,000
they are to contribute to the cost of the
scheme. What with £20.000,000 of Common-
wealth revenue, and £15,000,000 of State
loan funds, and day labor, and the 44-hour
week, and unprecedented opportunities of
sending trusty bands of Labor-unionists into
the right constituencies, the “Federal-aid”
roads promise to be the most gorgeously ex-
pensive highways ever laid down by man.
* *• * *
Australia is already paying heavily for the
tendency to regard road-construction and
maintenance as a matter of finding work for
the unemployed, especially the clients of
Labor politicians and aldermen. It is cost-
ing more to construct roads—-some roads, at
all events—than 3ft. 6in. railways. West-
ralian Railways Commissioner Pope records
that the Bussellton-Witchcliffe line, 42 miles
42 chains, was built for £189,000, the Witeh-
cliffe-Flinders Bay extension, 24 miles 27
chains, for £68,000, and the Narembeen-
Merredin length, 53 miles 47 chains, for
£242,000—a1l three were completed in 1924-
Jo. Those figures may be compared with
the subjoined items from the report of the
S- Wales Public Works Department for
1924-25 —and the 44-hour week hadn’t then
arrived:—
The George’s Riven-Sutherland section of the
Prince’s Highway, 4 miles 20 chains, was re-
constructed in water-bound macadam at a cost of
£22,568. The Sutherland-Loftus section, 1 mile
37 chains, mopped up £7714. It took another
£7139 to provide both lengths with a coat of
asphaltum and fin. metal.
The P arramatta-McGratli’s Hill section of the
Great Northern Road, 16 miles 43 chains, was re-
constructed in water-bound macadam for £107,345
and asphalted as above for an additional £17,308.
A Bankstowr, length, 6 miles 9 chains, of the
Great Southern Road cost £46,372 to reconstruct
and £6487 to asphalt. The Denham Court-Oampbell-
town section, 5 miles 21 chains, was reconstructed
and asphalted for £44,914. On the Campbelltown-
Cowpastures section, 4 miles 62 chains, £45,800 was
actually expended, but it is explained that the cost
of a deviation was reckoned in.
Nine miles 8 chains of the T.oftus-Bulli Road,
reconstructed in gravel, cost £12,853. And £7O6S
was paid for 66 chains of bituminous macadam in
the municipality of Enfield.
In effect, N. S. Wales macadamised roads
coated with asphalt cost about twice as much
per mile—three times as much in one case—as
railways in Westralia. Another paragraph
of the P.W.D. report deals with closer-settle-
ment roads. It says that, apart from £2642
spent in one district and £5Bl in another
(portion was collared for a bridge), “there
was no expenditure on closer-settlement
roads, although numerous investigations were
undertaken at the instance of the Lands De-
partment and reports furnished.” This sug-
gests that remote communities with no poli-
tical pull will have a poor chance of seeing
any of the Commonwealth’s £20,000,000,
especially as the proposals for the expendi-
ture thereof are to be drawn up by State
Ministers with headquarters in Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and
Perth.
V M ¥ #
Australia needs more aud better and
cheaper roads, but it is no part of the Cqjij-
monwealth Govemment’s duty to furnfeh
tliem, except on its own vast estate. Apart
rom the tiny Canberra portion, that estat
has been sinfully neglected. And, since the
(Tovernment has millions to burn, the build-
ing of a 4ft. Biin. railway to Darwin, instead
ot the 3ft. Gin. affair which conflicts
so outrageously with the gauge-standardis-
ing policy on which the Prime Minister held
forth at the transport conference, should take
precedence, with auxiliary roads and water
supplies, over any plan for building or sub-
sidising public works outside its own pro-
vince. If the Administration feels that it
must butt into the State road business, there
is no occasion for dealing with the Big-City
Governments at all, much less giving them
£20,000,000 to squander on day-labor jobs,
political and otherwise. It has a Works
Department, which should be capable of pre-
paring a national plan of road-construction
from proposals submitted by municipal coun-
cils, shire councils and road boards through-
out Australia, and of seeing that contracts
are properly carried out.
MOTHER ENGLAND’S GREAT
TROUBLE.
Almost ever since trades-unionism became a
fact the joyous and beautiful notion of the
complete or “general” strike has given the
leaders of working men and women a warm
feeling around the heart. Like most lovely
ideals, it is impossible of realisation, but an
approximation is possible given faith, backed
by careful preparation. Such an approxi-
mation would have afflicted Mother England
in the early part of the post-war troubles
had the famous “Triple Alliance” not dis-
solved into shuddering units at the first on-
slaught. Within the last few days it has
been demonstrated that the lesson taught to
British trade-unionists on that occasion was
not lost. It was cherished in the hearts of
men of the calibre of Cook, the miners'
leader, and the fanatical fringe of Soviet-
sympathisers which is always being sup-
pressed on the surface and given a free rein
underneath the staid old British Labor move-
ment. The essentials of the old alliance were
coal, represented by the miners; and food,
represented by the transport workers, such as
the raihvaymen. On this occasion a real
third leg is added to the alliance by the
adherence of newspaper-printers, who are
needed to maintain communication.
* * * *
The main question at issue in the Three
Kingdoms at the moment is whether a Labor
junta—ostensibly led by nice, prosperous
gentlemen like Ramsay Macdonald,
“Uncle Arthur” Henderson and J. 11.
Thomas, but; really run by much more in-
dustrious persons—is to rule Britain, or his
Majesty’s Government, headed by the ami-
able, but not too amiable, Stanley Bald-
win and lieutenanted by such brisk lads as
Winston Churchill and Joynson Hicks.
The root of the bother, of course, is the
inability of the British mine-owners and
miners to compete with foreign producers of
coal. Britain has never been able to use
all the coal it could produce, and
the necessity for keeping production
costs below those of Continental mines
employing the very cheapest labor lias
made British coal-mining a. hard occupation.
In the last three or four decades thy industry
has been up against it to such tin extent
that politicians with a taste for exploiting
the tears of a sentimental public have devoted
themselves to devising more or less spec-
tacular means of helping the poor miner and
his family—and it is usually a pretty large
family. When the pot boiled over on May
Day sympathy for the miner and his family
had been expressed to the extent of giving
him a State subsidy of Is. 6d. on every ton
of coal he hewed to enable him to work 42
hours a week and earn a living wage, with
another Is. 6d. a ton to provide a profit for
the owners of the mines, who otherwise —
such is the moral turpitude of coal-owners —
might have gone out of business. But the
miners were not grateful. They were in-
formed, more or less reliably, by gentlemen
in their employ who bad a passion for sta-
tistics, that they were really 30 per cent,
worse off than when, on August 4, 1914, the
world went round a corner to settle an argu-
ment.
The latest Coal Commission, after hear-
ing all the evidence that could ,be heard
on this and many other points in a compli-
cated business, decided that the miners had
been misinformed on the point. St also de-
cided that something would have to be done
with an industry that couldn’t pay the
miner’s notion of a living wage without go-
ing broke. It wasn’t much use increasing
production—which would have been Henry
Ford’s recipe—because there was more Brit
isb coal on the market than could be sold
at the time the Commission was racking its
brains over the problem. The continuance
of a subsidy that -was costing the nation
something over 20 millions a year, and that
only promised to make the trouble worse, was
not advised. Something. had to give, and the
miner’s wage got the nomination, to the extent
of about 11 per cent. Also the State was
advised to produce a hundred millions or so
and eliminate the ground landlord, who has
a way of living in palaces and riding around
in steam yachts and generally creating an
impression of indecent wealth which annoys
the miner; further, it was urged to apply
suasion to the colliery managements to in-
duce them to amalgamate—very much on
the lines of the amalgamations that were
forced upon the proprietaries of British rail-
ways early in the post-war fever of reorgan-
isation. There was to be an earnest effort
on the part of the colliery managements to
reduce selling and distribution costs, and
the report wound up with some very nice
references to the large amount of good that
could be done to the industry if the owners
would only buy a few scientists and get them
to start researching. There were hints,
too, that the wage fund ought to
be pooled by profitable and unprofitable
mines why unprofitable mines should
be encouraged to persist is a peculiarly
British mystery-—and that there should
be a gradation of wage according to the siz*'
of a man’s family. The latter suggestion,
except that it may have inspired some des
perate manager of an unprofitable min*’ with
an idea of pulling even by employing only
celibate miners, does not seem to have man '
friends, and the only real question on which
there is now a split between miners and


owners is the simple one of pay. The miners
won’t accept an 11 per cent, reduction or
any reduction. The owners, bereft of their
subsidy, can’t carry on at the present wage
rates, and have no intention of trying to
do so. In the background are the Red wing
of the Labor party, sharpening its teeth at
the prospect of precipitating a real class
war, and such romantic adventurers as Win-
ston Churchill, dreaming,' perchance, a
dream about a new Cromwell or a British
Mussolini.
* * * *
It is an occasion when Mother has a
very good opportunity of discovering who are
her friends—and her enemies—and which
will be wasted if it is not used to impress
upon the miners and everyone else that two
and two make four, not five, and that it is
impossible to get a quart out of a pintpot.
When those lessons in arithmetic and capa-
city have been digested everybody will feel
a lot better. And not in Britain only. We
have just as much need of the lessons in Aus-
tralia. Our real misfortune has been and
still is that it is easy for a young country
to borrow and so make the total up to five.
But the time comes for the paying back, and
then the trouble is that for a time two and
two are only three.
“A POUND A WEEK AND RATIONS.”
In the good old ’sixties the art of grabbing
the earth and the fulness thereof, practised
by N. S. Wales squatters and the big mon-
etary institutions, was a comparatively simple
matter. Selections were taken up in a
derisive spirit in the names of historical per-
sonages like Sweeny Todd, Oliver Crom-
well and Judas Iscariot. It was hardly
necessary in those days to make even a pre-
tence of bona-fide settlement. But in ISB4,
when the squatters’ leases were divided, and
one-half was called the “resumed area” and
made available for closer settlement, it be-
came necessary to go about the business of
dummying with more caution, for even a
local Land Board began to suspect that the
ghost of Judas Iscariot might not prove a
desirable settler. So incurables from public
hospitals who were at least still alive took
a hand in populating the wilderness. They
were provided with everything necessary to
pass the perfunctory examination of the
Land Board, and were then taken out to
their little huts, wherein they sat down to
enjoy the pleasures of being settled on the
land; incidentally, also, to enjoy the O.P.
rum and sheep-wash tobacco provided by
their benefactor. Their wills, of course, had
been drawn in the thoughtful squatter’s
favor. Mainly owing to too much publicity,
that method of acquiring land presently got
talked about, and the big sharks had to
abandon it.
An Act of ’9l allowed a selector who had
“done his time” on a 40-acre block to in-
crease it to 2560 acres in the Central Divi-
sion without further restriction as to resi-
dence. Obviously this concession was in-
tended to apply only to a selector who. hav-
ing “served his sentence” on 40 acres, was
fairly entitled to increase it to the same
area as was held by a selector who had
enough capital to start with the full acreage
allowed by the Act. But it was not long
before the land-grabbers commenced to
“work” the new clause. One old squatter
who devoted all his spare time to the study
of loopholes is credited with the discovery
of the new way of dummying. He bought
up all the small “residence-completed” blocks
ou his N. S. Wales stations, and applied for
additional C.P.’s and C.L.’s to the full
amount that could be added to them. The
applications were objected to by men who
saw the danger of such a scheme; but
“Jacky” stood his ground upon the word-
ing of the clause and triumphed.
In addition to its other manifest, advan-
tages this clause considerably reduced the
cost and risk of dummying. By placing a
dummy on a full area the lessee risked a fair
amount of cash upon the good faith of his
tool, who, naturally, was not a man with too
rigid a regard for truth and honesty. Gener-
ally, he was one in whom the elements of
rascality and idiocy were fairly blended, but
sometimes the former gift kicked the beam
and upset the lessee’s calculations. On one
occasion a northern squatter named —well,
Jones employed a fencer (one Smith) to
dummy a block not far from the Jones
homestead. Smith drew his pound a week
and rations regularly, and spent his time
fencing and improving the block until lxis
five-years’ residence had expired. Just be-
fore he got his certificate, .Jones was fool-
ish enough to quarrel with Smith, with the
result that Smith merely paid off Jones's
loan of £lOO, and kept the area. And Jones
couldn't do anything except swear whenever
he thought of paying Smith a pound a week
and tucker for five years to improve his own
land. One large north-western pastoral co.
lost a whole batch of dummy selections
through saemng a manager who had been
emploved on the station all his life. The
dummies, all station employees, registered
their disapproval of the new management
by refusing to go on with the farce of pos-
ing as men who had “selected the land for
their sole use and benefit.”
At one time the dummy had a difficulty
in explaining where lie got the money to
select with. In a small community a station
employee’s financial strength was known,
and the “legacy” from an ancient and
obscure relative had been worn so thin that
even a Land Board had begun to sniff when
it was mentioned. Consequently when “con-
sultations” on racing events became popular
they soon played an important part in
“settling” the Backblocks. When one heard
some station pet spreading the glad tidings
that he had drawn a horse in the Melbourne
Cup, it was safe to bet that he would shortly
select a desirable block of the boss’s re-
sumed area. The boss generally accepted
the blow in a Christian spirit, even to the
extent of instructing the fortunate rouse-
about how to describe the land on his appli-
cation-form. Neglect of this friendly assist-
ance was apt to lead to an awkward situa-
tion. For instance, one day a jackeroo rode
to the G Lands Office to lodge an appli-
cation for a block on the station he was em-
ployed upon. The Government official read
the application and then inquired: “On
which side of the river is this land situated!”
“D—d if I know,” replied the bona-fide
settler. The official grinned and returned
the application, remarking: “Go back an
tell Mr. F [the station manager] that
his description of the land is incomplete, i
was in court when the jackeroo appeared to
support his application, and the joke was
that everyone present, except perhaps tne
chairman of the board, knew that the appli-
cant never had a fiver to call his own.
A curious fact about dummying was that
the only people who couldn’t detect it were
those who were employed to prevent it. Une
heard more perjury in a three-days sitting
of a Land Board than all the police courts
listened to in a year. Yet one never heard
of a prosecution. The refusal of a dummy s
application for land only meant that his per-
juries were so clumsy that even the board
could see that the truth was not in him.
There is little employment for dummies
now in N. S. Wales, simply because there
are no Crown lands left that are worth the
risk. The Government of these days has
to re-purchase at a high figure the land that
was jobbed away at a nominal price, and
the young Australians who are looking in
vain for a chance to put their land experi-
ence to profitable use are mostly the sons
and grandsons of the men who assisted the
grabbers to deprive them of their, birthright
for a “pound a week and rations.”
CRIPPS CLARK.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Saviour in the Street.
It lias seemed certain all along that, the
strike-revolution in England will collapse
from the same cause as the similar attempt
in 1919. That cause was the vast reserve
of fairly efficient volunteer labor on which
the maintainers of law and order were able
to draw. There is in Britain a large class
which, for many reasons, has a more or less
silent antipathy to working-class class-con-
sciousness, though it is steeped in its own.
In older days this conventionalised herd was
confined in narrow limits of thought and
accomplishment, following numberless neces-
sary but rather futile avocations, and unable
to go for a moment outside its own line. The
Great, War. with all its drawbacks, recondi-
tioned these people. They were picked up
by the hundred thousand and taught that
they were capable of doing a hundred things
besides quill-driving, or shop-walking, or some
other of the legion of “clean-collar" jobs.
When flic fighting was over, a great propor-
tion of these men came back to civil life with
a new sense of manhood. They had found
out what they had never realised before—-that,
given the chance, they could swing a pick,
drive and repair a lorry, use the telegraph
and wireless, and generally do effectively a
dozen jobs which they had hitherto regarded
as sealed mysteries peculiar to that other
caste which in civil life had monopolised
them. These men had, moreover, learned
organisation and the sense of duty and discip-
line. When the trouble threatened in 1919 they
came to the assistance of the nation in such
convincing manner as to satisfy the strikers
that, their attempt to paralyse the national
machine was useless —for the time being, at
any rate—and they surrendered. Though it
is eight years since the Armistice the same
spirit is evident enough in the present up-
heaval. and the rush “to the colors” of this
class of ex-service men has already assured
the Government of man-power to carry its
task of maintaining a measure of national
service and supply. The lesson is worth
noting by some of our own people. A very
great proportion of Australia’s population, il
not in the same category as that above de-
scribed, is invincibly opposed to the bluffer
and the bully, whether they walk in the
ranks of Capital or Labor. Time and again
this section has stood solidly behind its
fellow-Australians with a genuine grievance
calling for redress. Just as often it has
turned against the hold-upper and the double-
crosser. There is evidence enough of this in
the shattering of the 1917 strike and in last
year’s Federal elections, to go no further.

Drys, Wets and Damps.
Dear Bulletin.— lt would be a blessed re-
lief if the United States would decide on the
merits or demerits of Prohibition and cable
the result, instead of shipping us incoherent
masses of undigested testimony which ends
as it began. What the Drys say about the
beautiful results of Prohibition makes the
country look too much like heaven to be
credible. What the Wets say about its evil
consequences is hot enough to cremate a dead
body. A third crowd, which probably in-
cludes the Damps but which speaks chiefly
through the mouths of judges and lawyers,
says that the law has fallen into such con-
tempt and disrepute that the Republic has
almost ceased to rank as a civilised laud,
and makes remarks like this: —
There are 118,000 men and women murderers at
large who have never been brought to justice. During
1925 there were more than 10,000 criminal homi-
cides as compared with 100 in England. Evil-minded
men in the United States have no respect for the law
because it has been their experience that they need
have no fear of its penalties. The criminal knows
that the chances are three to one that he will never
be arrested if he kills, twelve to one that he will
never be convicted, and more than 100 to one that,
if he is convicted, it will not be for that crime.
So the verdict is that Prohibition has been
a failure, not necessarily because it is Pro-
hibition. but because a legal system which
misses 99 homicides out of 100 is likely to
miss 95 distilleries out of 100 while it is
still young and fresh at the game, and more
when it becomes old and fagged. That the
country has gone from bad to worse under
Prohibition proves nothing against Prohibi-
tion. It was going in any case, through
enfeebled law, misguided lmmanitarian-
ism, and maudlin sympathy with crimi-
nals. Queensland is strongly develop-
ing the same maudlin sympathy, and
no one has noticed much Prohibition in
Queensland. Scripture supplies two prece-
dents. The first was a complete code of laws
given for the guidance of a ruling race, and
there was no maudlin sympathy about it.
The idea that the criminal might be im-
proved by having his sentence remitted didn’t
enter into it anywhere. For specified
offences the common penalty was death, car-
ried out promptly by the local populace,
thereby saving the executioner’s wages. The
other penalty, for unspecified crimes (in
fact, when there was “a controversy between
men”), was anything up to 40 lashes, also
delivered on the spot. The country seems
to have been singularly free of crime under
this regime, and there is little mention of
illicit distillation, burglary, forgery or falsi-
fication of accounts. The second, or New
Testament, code, consisting of a large collec-
tion of scattered maxims, carried forbear-
ance almost to the point of non-resistance
and the abrogation of the criminal law. But
the subject folk to whom it was addressed
had no longer the old use for a criminal
code or the old power to enforce it. Their
Roman masters attended to that sort of
thing. To be peaceful, long-suffering and
unobtrusive might be good policy for a small
new sect in rough times, but the conquering
race, wasn’t told that an empire could be run
on the lines of the Sermon on the Mount.
Curiously enough, the new sect had so little
faith in forbearance and forgiveness and
immunity that St. Peter executed two Early
Christians for a trivial offence, and religious
opinion has been with Peter ever since. The
theory that the apostle didn't kill them, but
that they died naturally, is quite untenable.
What Peter would have done with the
118,000 murderers-at-large in the U.S. if he
had taken a hand in the Prohibition contro-
versy may be imagined. The funerals would
have extended for miles. —Yours, Amateur
Theologian.

A Rift for a Struggling University.
The 14-year-old University of W.A. mainly
owes its genesis to the vision, the enthusi-
asm and the practical help of one man, the
late John AVinthrop Hackett, M.L.C. and
newspaper proprietor; now, 10 years after
llackett’s death, it has received a magnifi-
cent legacy from the estate of perhaps the
most public-spirited man the Western city
lias ever known. All the dispositions for his
family and others provided in his will having
been met, the bulk of the residue goes to the
University and the remainder to the Angli-
can Church for what are essentially Univer-
sity purposes. The bequest consists mainly
of the AVeht Australian newspaper, Perth’s
only morning daily, which has so far defied
or beaten off all competition and holds a
unique position in the State —perhaps in any
State. The sale of the newspaper, which was
never so prosperous as it is now and whose
potentialities increase yearly, should be quite
sufficient to put the youngest of Australian
universities, and the Cinderella of them, well
on its feet. It has had a hard struggle, and
one that might well have disheartened a less
determined staff. Started without buildings
except a few makeshift classrooms and
starved from the outset, and especially
during the war years, for money—
it had to manage as best it could on an
annual grant of less than £15,000 from the
Government, and Parliament refused to
allow it to charge tuition fees—it none the
less succeeded in obtaining and in most cases
keeping a staff of professors and lecturers
who have done admirable work in the face of
appalling difficulties, and it has already given
the youth of the State educational chances
that’ hundreds of them could never have
hoped to obtain otherwise. A fine feature
has been the spirit of self-sacrifice and
loyalty to a struggling institution shown by
academic authorities whose capacity and
attainments could have won them higher
material rewards in larger Australian cities
and better-endowed universities. And indi-
vidual benefactions, of which there are many
shining examples in the Eastern States, have
been so rare —though there are wealthy pas-
toralists and merchants in AA r estralia, as else-
where —as to be practically negligible. But
the newest of Australian universities ought
to be now safely over a harder infancy than
has fallen to the lot of any of its elder sisters,
thanks to Hackett. The State gave him
great opportunities and did much for him ;
hi's name deserves to be remembered as one
who never forgot the debt and left most of
his wealth worthily for the benefit of those
who were to come after him.

Doctors’ Prescriptions.
“Carysfort” : The recent fatality in Sydney
caused by the wrong interpretation of a pre-
scription cannot fairly be ascribed to the
“archaic system of pharmaceutical symbols’
(B. G/5,/’26). Neither Latin words nor
Roman numerals contributed even remotely
to the tragedy. Latin is used in prescribing
because it is the international language of
science, and a prescription can be dispensed
or drugs described in any civilised country
by a dispenser ignorant of the language of
the writer. The illegibility of physicians is
no greater danger in Latin, even if it be
“dog Latin,” than in English, French or
German. It is true that the metric system
is used for quantities outside of English-
speaking countries, but the metric system is
equally liable to errors, perhaps more so,
because the prescribed quantities so often
need a decimal point followed by one or more
o’s. Much criticism has been aimed at the
use of Roman numerals in place of Arabic,
but there is no doubt that the latter are
more liable to be misread. Unless very care-
fully formed. 2, 3 and 5 are confusing, as
also 1 and 7. In prescribing, the upright
strokes of the Roman figures are dotted, and
the Y has a stroke above and the X a stroke
above and beneath. I have never heard of
a case of these Roman figures being misun-
derstood. A safeguard in common use is
the stating of the age of the patient, if a child ;
also it is the duty of the dispenser to com-
municate with the prescriber if a dose m
excess of the usual has been written. It has
been stated that dispensers who do this have
been snubbed. They may have been: there
are asses even behind brass plates. Certainly
doctors who value their own reputation and
the good name of the profession will and do
welcome this evidence of care on the part
of a dispenser. Further, if, as is frequently
the case, an unusually large dose is intended,
it is well for the prescriber to initial the
actual dose. This relieves the dispenser of
responsibility, as it demonstrates that the
dose has been carefully considered. Again,
some doctors write tlieir prescriptions giving
the amount of the ingredients in each dose,
and some write the total amount in the
bottle. It would make for additional safety
if one or other of these precautions became
universal. Finally. I am confident that both
dispensers and physicians would be grateful
for any practical suggestions for additional
safety other than uninformed criticism of the
use of Latin words and of Roman numerals.
«
Progress anti a Push-cart.
“Nakhoda” : I went to the International
Motor Show in the Melbourne Exhibition
and was duly blinded by the dazzle of Italian
bodies and impressed by the perfect working
of American engines. I was also amazed
at the ingenuity displayed in the "something
new,” which this year includes a built-in
cigarette-case that lights the De Reszke
automatically when you extract it. I was
suitably awed by the statement of ofheials
that if the entire population of U.S.A.
decided to go for a joy-ride simultaneously
it could all be accommodated in motor-
cars ; also that in order to equal the average
of machines per head enjoyed by Maoriland
this country would have to import 200, 1 000
more Fords. Rolls Royces and Hispano
Suizas. I likewise listened to the opening
speeches, in which the word progress occurred
with frequency. I still, however, fail to sec
how the possession of one imported motor-
car per person, or even 10 imported motor-
cars, has to do with progress. I don’t see
how slinging an ornate temple of luxury on
wheels off a steamer, filling it with foreign
oil and steering it around the countryside
until it falls to pieces and then importing
a new machine to take its place, has to do
with the advancement of the Australian
people. I have myself taught an ex-Bornean
headhunter, in three lessons, how to run a
Crossley oil-engine, manage a dynamo and
charge accumulators. I even succeeded in
teaching him the connections of simple elec-
trical circuits, and methods of testing. Ile
began to interlard his native language with
words like “volt” and “niilliampere. ’ Clad
in blue dungarees and armed with a spanner,
he looked quite civilised at times. Neverthe-
less, when his wife had a baby 1 had to give
him a fortnight’s holiday to lie in, it being
the local custom to put the spirits of evil oil
the scent by pretending that it is the father
that lias been made a mother. I also knew
a Malay potentate to whom a foreign Bower
presented a beautiful motor-launch. r l ite
foreign expert took the prince out for some
rides, and then departed. After a week or so
a nut or two fell off, and the engine ceased
to function, although several fowls and a
fat calf were sacrificed to it. _ The monarch
was then paddled about in his launch until
somebody looked in and replaced the miss-
ing nuts; and then everything in the garden
was lovely again. So I can’t believe that the
man who runs an engine is necessarily doing
an intelligent thing. In fact, I believe he
may be doing a darned foolish and unintelli-
gent thing.
Starvation for Travelling Stock.
“Stockowner” : Conditions so far as travel-
ling stock are concerned have changed for
the better in N. S. Wales of late years. 1' at
stock are carried on trains much faster than
formerly—a distinct improvement, both from
the economic and the humanitarian view-
point. Also, water is nowadays more plen-
tiful along the routes, though much still re-
mains to be done before conditions will be
satisfactory in that respect. So much may
he granted to the credit side of the ledger:
now the debits clamor for entry. During
recent years the stock routes have been con-
siderably curtailed through large portions
being secured as original or additional areas
by private individuals. Moreover, the prac-
tice of renting routes to graziers of adjoin-
ing lands cannot be too strongly condemned.
These people pay a paltry sum each year for
the use of the routes, and often imagine they
are entitled to observe a haughty—not to say
arrogant—attitude towards drovers and
owners of travelling stock. Certainly there
are restrictions as to stocking these routes,
but it would take a regiment of inspectors
to enforce them. Indeed, so completely does
custom engulf the average conscience that
most graziers would feel profoundly ashamed
of themselves if they didn’t keep the routes
well eaten out. The result is that, while
there is feed on the routes in flush seasons
when it isn’t particularly wanted, as soon as
a dry spell comes and stock begin to move
about seeking relief country, it is mostly over
barren wastes they are forced to move.
Deaths on the road are in consequence very
numerous. It frequently happens that, m
such circumstances owners of stock prefer
to risk a break in the weather to tackling
the routes. Thus, though relief country can
be procured in most droughts, the state of
the routes is likely to prevent it being
utilised. It might be objected that starving
stock could be trucked to their destination :
but the trouble is that, just about the time
stock begin to starve in earnest, trucks begin
to get scarce in earnest. I have had to wait
as much as two months ror trucks during a
dry spell. Moreover, some sheep live a
mighty long way from railway stations, and
have to use the routes just the same. One
would naturally imagine that pastoralists
would be profoundly concerned in keeping
the routes in good order. But, oddly enough,
such is not the case. Everyone hopes that a
drought will never again arrive. Everyone
also hopes that it will be the other fellow
who will have to use the routes if a drought
does arrive.
Sun-Bathing.
Dear Bulletin, —“For having been on the
Williamstown beach foreshore in bathing-
costumes, A, B, C and D were fined 10s.
each in the Williamstown (Vic.) Police
Court.” In Alton, Hampshire, there is a
hospital for tuberculous children, at which
I was privileged to work for a year. The
principal therapeutic agencies used in this
hospital, which is quite famous for its cures,
are heliotherapy, or sun-batliing, and artifi-
cial-light treatment, which may be sum-
inarilv but fairly described as bottled sun-
bathing. The doctors at the hospital had
noticed that the patients, after some weeks
under this treatment, not only exhibited an
appearance of robust health and improved
physique, but were also much happier, more
vivacious and more generally alert. A wide
range of mental tests was applied to the
children, and the results were compared with
those of a group of similar children in Lon-
don who had not had the advantages of the
sun-bathing and artificial-light treatment.
The mental tests manifested an appreciable
difference in intelligence between the two

says “there has never yet been a fatal case
reported.” Osler says: “Dengue is very
seldom fatal. Dr. Dickson saw three
deaths in the (Charleston epidemic.” If three
deaths were seen by one doctor in one town
it is a safe assumption that there has been
mortality elsewhere. In the face of the fore-
going, what reliance can be placed on any
view or statement of “M.B. 1922” ? He says
dengue has no ill-effects beyond discomfort.
I would recommend him to take a job as
locum for some overworked and dengue-
stricken doctor in a northern or

“W.P.D.”: “Cleveland” (B. 29/4/’2G)
objects to my statements with regard to
the yield of cassava in North Queensland,
etc. Officials of the Queensland Department
of Agriculture arc quite sure that no esti-
mate ever came from there of an average
crop of eight tons per acre, but confirmed my
statement that from 10 to 20 tons was usual,
and that with the right varieties and condi-
tions and reasonably good cultivation 20 tons
might be expected. They also confirmed what
I said about crops in the Cardwell district
and on the Bloomfield giving over 20 tons.
Some years ago 1 saw crops in the
Ingham district running well over 20 tons.
groups, and in favor of the Alton patients.
The problem was to account for this differ-
ence. It could not be accounted for in
terms of heredity, because, if anything, the
advantage lay with the London children.
Nor could it be accounted for in terms of
educational facilities, or of the nature of the
physical defect, because the Alton children
had had less schooling than the children in
London, and their physical defect was much
more serious. Only one explanation was
possible—that the mental superiority of the
Alton children was due to the sun-bathing
and the artificial-light treatment. Follows
the moral. Australia is well supplied with
sunshine; we boast of it; we sing of it;
at times we would even be rid of it. One
thing only remains to be done —to use it.
We want more hospitals with a “light” de-
partment attached; we want open-air schools
for weakly children where, clad in the scan-
tiest of raiment, they can be taught their
ABO even while the beneficial ultra-violet
rays of the sun are soaking through their
skins and sending up their intelligence
quotients.—Yours, etc., Sike.

Sydney taxi companies now find it worth
while to pay commissionaires to take a stand
in a doorway of the big stores for the con-
venience of clients. With one of the co.'s
portable telephones the attendant can ring
up the nearest car of his color, and have it
on the spot in a few seconds; and without
the big stores paying a penny a convenience
is provided for their customers, whilst the
occasional requests to their own employees
to ring for taxis are cut out. But the big-
gest of the cos. struck an unexpected diffi-
culty with the Railway Commissioners, ivho
sooled its commissionaires off the Sydney
station, and decreed that all cars must take
their place in the ranks, from which vehicles
would be drawn in rotation. The decision is
as foolish as it is archaic. The cheapen-
ing of taxi-hire depends upon organisation
which will keep the cars busy; and it will
be an intolerable grievance if citizens are
compelled by the rotation system to take
cars which may hit them up for several times
the fare charged by the organised companies.
The organised service moreover offers a
guarantee that every one of its drivers and
its vehicles is dependable; there can be no
such guarantee from the The rota-
tion regulation was made to fit a day that
is past, to prevent brawls on the ranks: but
if a company has the enterprise to introduce
new and much improved methods, old
fashions will have to go down before the
better organisation. If the Railway Com-
misioners’ absurd decision prevails in this
ease we shall next find them ordering the
railway bookstalls to hand out magazines
and papers in rotation: and if the plan is
adopted in the refreshment rooms it will be
no more ridiculous than it is where it has
been already imposed.

“Hamfat” : An absurd agitation of the
hurry-up school has been started for the abo-
lition of delivered lectures at the University;
it is claimed that all the purposes of the lec-
ture could be fulfilled if the matter was
written and issued in printed or typed sheets
for “swatting” in the places where the stu-
dents burn their midnight juice. That sys-
tem might give a temporary grip upon a sub-
ject sufficient to carry one over an impend-
ing examination; but it would do away with
threequarters of the illumination that leads
to lasting knowledge. I remember taking
chemistry as an extra subject for an exami-
nation, and, after a mere three weeks’ read-
ing, scoring 133 marks out of 200. Yet
chemistry I now know nothing about. In
this connection the actor's method is worth
considering. The man who best knows his
business first gets someone to read the part
to him ; next, he writes out the part: then re-
hearsal gives him the real meaning of the
words. It is the oral work which matters
most. The additional advantage of the
delivered lecture is that the student who is
puzzled upon some point unexplained can im-
mediately seek light. The lectureless lecture is
the idea of a quick-lunch type of mind which
regards examinations merely as hurdles on
the road to those diplomas which authorise
the collection of fees; and from the addition
of any more people of that class than already
get through to our professional avocations,
good Lord deliver us!
“H.P.”: “M.B. 1922” misquotes Sir Wil-
liam Oslek about dengue fever (B.
(i/5/’26). Says “M.B. 1922”: “Oslek tells
us briefly that it is a vj?ry rare disease.” In
the two pages devoted to dengue, in his
“Principles and Practice of Medicine,” eighth
edition, he speaks of the numerous wide-
spread epidemics in tropical and sub-tropical
countries since the disease was first recog-
nised in 1779. “M.B. 1922” says “it is an
extremely difficult complaint to diagnose.”
Osler says: “The diagnosis of the disease,
prevailing as it does in epidemic form and
attacking all classes indiscriminately, rarely
offers any special difficulty. Isolated cases
might be mistaken at first for rheumatic
fever.” There is no suggestion that dengue
and ’flu might be confounded, as “M. 8.”

APPLYING THE GREAT PRINCIPLE.
“What’s the game, chargin’ me for four dozen of beer when I only had forty-four
bottles?”
“The boss says that’s right, Mister—-he’s trading on the principle of forty-eight hours’ pay
for forty-four hours’ work.”
A bulletin issued by the Commonwealth De-
partment of Science and Industry also states
that cassava crops yield from 10 to 20 tons
per acre, and that 40 gallons alcohol per
ton is an average for good sorts. If Monieb
Williams says cassava does best in a dry,
sandy soil, his experience is totally opposed
to that of North Queensland and Java. Shal-
low planting is usual in Java, and the cas-
sava is ready for use in eight months, but
it may stand over for two years, resulting
in bigger tubers. Starch contents and yield
of eight varieties likely to be imported into
Queensland were carefully tested, and were’
found to average 80 per cent, to 8S per cent,
starch contents, and yield from 18 tons to
22.4 tons per acre. The methods of pre-
paration of the land and cultivation of the
crop in the sugar districts of Queensland
are much in advance of those in Java, and
this will assuredly lead to considerably in-
creased yields per acre, with corresponding
decrease in cost of production.
“F.S.M.”: The power* of the police Under
the Licensing Act are gradually being
whittled away by magisterial decisions. At
Wagga (N.S.W.) recently a licensee was
charged with serving two men with whisky
on a Sunday through a sliding shutter in
the bar. No attempt was made to deny that
drinks had been served; the defence was
that one man was a boarder and that
the other man intended to stay the night,
but his name had been “inadvertently
omitted from the register.” The magistrate
dismissed the charge on the ground that it
was sufficient compliance with the Act if
names of intending boarders were entered
at any time during the day of their arrival.
There was a further charge of serving drinks
direct from the bar, and this was also dis-
missed on the ground that the drinks had
not been consumed and it may have been
the intention to consume them away from
the bar. The police are wondering what is
the use of closing the front doors of hotels
on Sundays.

“Medical Alienist”: To “S.N.R.” (B.
29/4/’2G) I readily admit that the hypno-
tism of words and phrases applies to the
“best circles” as well as to the Domain. The
practical difference is that in the one case
they are usually merely ridiculous, while in
the other they are consciously or uncon-
sciously employed by “demagogues” (his
word) for purposes usually dangerous to the
people, and frequently malicious. “S.N.lt.”
accuses me of inconsistency, in that I deny
the existence of a master class in Australia,
and later refer to the master class in Russia.
But my argument, which apparently he
missed, is that it is only the hypnotism of
catch phrases that would enable a freeborn
son of freeborn parents to tolerate a com-
parison with those serfs of Mongolian origin,
who have, to their sorrow, recently exchanged
their former Scandinavian masters for their
present Teuton and Hebrew bosses. He also
asserts that a member of an audience reached
by a “demagogue” is “incapable of marshal-
ling his facts and weighing them.” But
surely that doesn’t justify the use of catch
words to drug whatever rudimentary judg-
ment “S.N.R.” allows him.

“Parchment”: I was sent to manage a
rubber plantation of 2500 acres in the Malay
Peninsula. It had n bad record. Parts had
had to be replanted several times. Succes-
sive managers had left the country, bank-
nipt in reputation and health. Coolies,
enticed by promise of wages in excess of
the ruling rates, used to stay a few months
and then flee' from the death-trap. When 1
took over, the estate was once again merg-
ing into jungle, and there were only about
100 Asiatics on the place, half of whom were
new arrivals, only waiting for the first
monthly pay to get away again. The man-
dores (native overseers) mostly lived off
the estate, and came in every morning,
usually on push-bikes, clearing off again be-
fore sundown. The coolies, who remained,
were a sickly, listless crowd, chronic mal-
arial eases. I remember my first view of my
own mosquito-net. In that country one's
servant goes round before sundown, before
the mosquitoes get active, and carefully tucks
the ends of the net under the mattress all
round. On going to bed, I was shocked to
notice how dirty my net was. When I got
close to it I found that the net was not
dirty at all, but covered with myriads of
mosquitoes. It was a desperate situation,
but I was sent there with a free hand and
instructions to pull the place round regard-
less of cost. When I left the estate about
four years afterwards it was free from mos-
quitoes, and. though I was not foolhardy
enough to dispense with mosquito-nets my-
self, most of the coolies did not bother about
them. There was a labor force of about 050.
a healthy and contented lot, and my return
for malaria for the month had dropped from
over 00 to under 8 per cent., and most of
these were outside infections. I did a lot of
cleaning up. of course, draining, and taking
other measures to prevent water lying about,
but the main factor was oiling. A mos-
quito’s life runs in three stages: first an egg
floating on some stagnant water; then a
tadpole-like little grub floating with his nose
just projecting above the surface; lastly
the ordinary mosquito, which emerges from
the chrysalis of the tadpole and flies away.
Once the pest gets to the third stage, no-
thing much can be done. Oiling kills it in
the tadpole stage. The method I adopted
was to get a 20-gallon drum of crude oil,
pour out two kerosene-tins full, and replace
vdth ordinary kerosene oil, roll the drum
about to mix the two oils, and use the
mixture in an orchardist’s knapsack-spray.
Crude oil by itself was too thick, and
clogged the spray, while kerosene oil by
itself was too expensive, and not effective.
Two coolies and an overseer could go over
the whole estate, about nine square miles,
in 10 days. I do not believe in gauze doors
and windows : they are a nuisance, and ex-
pensive to maintain, and if you exterminate
the mosquitoes they are unnecessary.

“Canab” : It is scarcely to be wondered at
that the cattle tick is spreading fast in
southern and south-western Queensland and
the border districts of N. S. Wales, where
it has lately made its appearance in
parts previously uninfested. Under exist-
ing regulations it is permissible to send cattle
from the Darling Downs to Sydney without
any period of quarantine, although the latter
is necessary in other portions of the State
when cattle are moved. Many of the cattle
which are thus sent to N. S. Wales from the
Downs have come previously from places
where ticks are bad, and cases have been
known recently of infested stock being sent
to the southern State without examination
or quarantine. The Commonwealth ought
to take over the matter and introduce legis-
lation and regulations which will be uniform
on both sides of the border.
“Speculum" : One may at times doubt the
usefulness of the press, especially when it
starts to publish medical news. Observe
a present case. A young doctor develops
something he thinks is a cure for tubercu-
losis. Naturally he does not wish to have
his discovery stolen and his serum manufac-
tured by a rival or a profit-seeking pro
prietary. lie hies to the Health authori-
ties and makes an arrangement for the manu-
facture and testing of his cure. Now enter
the übiquitous newspaper reporter. Perhaps
a friend of the discoverer speaks out of his
turn. Perhaps the latter really thinks the
world should know all about it. Anyway,
the result is the same —publicity, acres of
publicity. The very latest development is
a report of a circular by an “association"
setting forth how, where and at what cost
the new cure may be obtained. Follow in-
quiries by the Health authorities and denials
by the physician, providing the “popular"
press with more paragraphs. What of the
suffers from T. 8.? They, poor devils, are
kept on tenterhooks, not knowing whether
the treatment is dinkum or not; whether
they can obtain it at a fair price, and where;
or whether they are merely being stung.
All this because some newspapers must have
sensations. Truth and accuracy perhaps,
but at all costs sensations. The reporter
gets his pay, the paper gets its paragraphs,
the discoverer gets his publicity (which he
may or may not want) and the T.B. sufferer
gets left. All this is supposed to be for the
good of the general public. Flow can it be?

POLITICAL
POINTS
The artistically-distributed minority which
votes Labor in Queensland is again assured
of at least seven-twelfths of the State
Assembly seats. Unopposed returns gave the
party a lead of four, and it seems to have
won 38 of the contested seats, leaving the
Opposition with 28. Had every vote, genu-
ine and fraudulent, had the same value, it
would have been the other way about. But
when the rolls —which always carry thous-
ands more names than the Commonwealth
rolls- —were made up it was found that there
were 9965 electors in Logan, 9903 in Oxley,
9684 in Enoggera, 8967 in Toowong, 5941
in Nundali, 8417 in Windsor. 8024 in Toom-
bul, 7984 in Wynnum, 7852 in Sandgate and
7769 in Albert, all Opposition constituencies.
On the other hand, there were only 2749 in
Labor Flinders, 4133 in Charters Towers,
4363 in Queenton, 4581 in Mt. Morgan, 4608
in Cook. 4738 in Chillagoe, 5045 in Leich-
hardt, 5125 in Balonne. 5301 in Townsville,
5314 in Gympie, 5340 in Rockhampton,
5390 in Maranoa and 5907 in Brisbane. The
Opposition did not lose a seat to the other
side, and went close to gaining Eacham,
Maree, South Brisbane, Port Curtis, Ken-
nedy and Merthyr. But the rolls and the
boundaries Avere too much for it. It was
handicapped out of the race.
On the Eluropean mainlaind a general
strike in a country lately racked by Avar
would haA-e been attended with vast blood-
shed. But there lias been no bloodshed in
Britain since millions of workmen laid down
their tools. Apart from the unspeakable
Saklatvala’s incitement to mutiny, and
sporadic hooliganism in haunts of misery
like the slum quarters of Glasgow and
London’s Dockland, the struggle has been
conducted soberly on both sides. Foreigners
have recorded their amazement at the spec-
tacle of strikers and police suspending
hostilities to play a football match, of Bald-
win offering the Trades Union Congress
space to present its case in the Government
newspaper, and of the T.U.C., short of funds
as it must be, refusing £lOO,OOO from Soviet
Russia. There have been innumerable indi-
cations that the feeling for order and the
instinct to do the decent and sporting thing
are by no means the monopoly of one class.
Truly J. Bull’s sons know lioav to behave
even when they are divided into two camps.
The pity is that, having endured so much side
by side, they should ever have been divided
into two camps.
Westralian Labor Avas in no mood for
rejoicing when the neAvs of McCormack’s
success arrived from Queensland, having
gone down heavily at the Leg. Council elec-
tions on the same day. Its solid Fremantle
vote enabled E. H. Gray to hold the West
Province seat, but the two goldfields divi-
sions, Avhich it expected to recapture (they
were soft things prior to 1917), turned it
down again, and its assaults on the Metro-
politan, Met.-Suburban and South-west Pro-
vinces failed dismally. Moreover, first-ballot
figures were against Tom Moore in the
scattered Central Province. Moore’s felloAV-
members are Chief Sec. Drew and Hon.
Minister Hickey, who haven’t completed
their terms. William Lathlain, sometime
Mayor of Perth, got in for the Met.-Sub.
Province. There is some talk of his suc-
ceeding Jimmy Mitchell as leader of the
Disunited party, but he will have to go
for an Assembly scat first. Westralia once
had a Leg. Council Premier (Colebatch)
for a few tumultuous Aveeks, but it wouldn’t
tolerate another.
Anticipating a deficit of between £150,000
and £200,000 by June 30, Chief Commis-
sioner Clapp has appealed to the Vie. Cabinet
to raise railway goods rates and fares. Un-
less his request is complied with, he predicts
a bigger shortage next year. Apart from
merely balancing the ledger, he wants a
sufficient depreciation fund to make good
exhausted and wasting assets so that capital
account will not be unduly loaded in alter
years. The Quick arbitration award sum]
the basic-wage adjustment added. £LoU,OUO a
year to Clapp’s wages bill, and there is motor
and tramway competition to meet. Allan and
Peacock have thrown out feelers to ascertain
how the public will take the suggested rise.
Nobody is enthusiastic, nor does anyone in
authority dare to more than whisper the
word “economy.”
Minister for Labor Baddelcy, who recently
toured the Southern Slates in search of an
all-round 44-hour week, returned a silent
and, apparently, abashed person. A cou-
tributing cause to his unusual pose may be
found in the emphatic curse hurled at the
proposal last week by Premier Lyons, of
Tasmania. That leader of Labor remarked
that 44 hours would spell the extinction of
Tasmanian industry while Victoria main-
tained the 48-liour period. Provided I ic-
toria’s tail was docked the other State foxes
could face the world undaunted, but not
otherwise. A lot of people in N.S.W. arc ol
the same opinion regarding that State, and
it is a fair bet that Baddeley and his boss,
Lang, are of the number.
The original plea for the 44-hour week,
that people can acquire so much energy at
pony races that they can do as much work in
44 hours as they before did in 48, lias been
stabbed dead over again by Prendergast,
M.L.A., recently Vic. Labor leader. At the
Geelong Eight Hours’ celebrations he asserted
that “the introduction of the 44-hour week
would mean that one additional man would
be employed for every 12 men engaged.” As
a matter of fact, that is wrong too. If
Bloggs, paying £l2 for overhead expenses,
£72 for power and material, and £72 for the
wages of six men, makes out of that outlay
of £156 a gross £l6B per week, he has a £l2
FIRST ONE, TEEN THE OTHER.
“The Victorian Railway Commissioners have requested the Government to increase fares and freights
all round, owing to increased wages and interest bill.”
profit. But a reduction of one-twelftli of tlie
working hours will reduce his £l6B gross pro-
fits to £154; and he will still have the same
wages and overhead, with a reduction on liis
raw material and power of £6. So his
working expenses will be £l5O, leaving him
£4 to cover his own effort, risk and petty
expenses which a boss has to meet. So the
result is more likely to be the unemployment
of 12 men than the employment of one extra.
Tasmanian Premier Lyons has announced
that State taxation will be reduced whether
the Commonwealth subsidy comes along or
not. It is estimated that the burden, quite
apart from Federal and local taxation, is
now £6 annually per head, which is destruc-
tive to enterprise. If sufficient aid is not
forthcoming, and in that tangible form which
is good for meeting gold liabilities abroad,
it is to be presumed that a notice, “Closed
Pending Reconstruction,'’ will be hung on
the door-knob at the island’s London office.
Either that or the Commonwealth will help
Tas. to raise another foreign loan, and post-
pone the problem that way.
The Commonwealth has formally appointed
its Loan Hog or Debt Accelerator, who is
to live in London. If Britain is really enter-
ing into a period of industrial war on _a
big scale the Accelerator may find it diffi-
cult to make himself heard above the dm.
Though a great deal is said about Common-
wealth surpluses, and Freetraders shout that
Customs taxes should be reduced, the Federal
authority has become a very consistent loan-
cadger. In addition to borrowing for war
purposes and for the States, the Federal
•‘Ordinary Loans Expenditure” has been: —
1920- £3,877,912
1921- >,246,503
1922- rillitl
1923- . . . . . . • • 0.008,890
1924- . . • • • • • • 0,341,758
So the habit is growing nicely.
The British Parliament has been dealing
with an overdue bill. It provides that every
money-lender must pay a license fee, may
charge no more than 48 per cent., must fur-
nish the borrower with a copy of the loan
agreement, .may not send his spidery circular
to anybody unless the fly has asked for it
in writing, and may not advertise anything
beyond his real name, occupation and
address. He mustn't even print the pious
remark that his aim in life is “to assist, not
to crush.”
“Cruncher” celebrates May Day:—
About 200 of us attended the Yarra Bank, and
10 of our Sunday-school children recited in shrill
treble the Socialist Ten Commandments, the most
blameless collection of pious platitudes ever car-
pentered. Then, poor kids, they danced round a
maypole as though they had to. The rest of the
proletariat was attending the opening of the foot-
ball season. Rain damped the proceedings on Sun-
day, but one stalwart remained undeterred. He
marched through the city carrying a large flag
inscribed with the word “Anarchy.” About 50
people followed him, most of them bored stiff. It
didn’t look a bit like a revolution.
According to Alderman Marks, the Sydney
City Council’s determination to give prefer-
ence of employment to residents in the city
area is already starting a back-to-the-slurns
movement. Those looking for municipal em-
ployment, and those hanging precariously on
to "the more uncertain sections of it, are
trampling each other underfoot in the effort
to crowd into the City of Refuge. Over-
crowding is becoming a scandal in some
quarters, but the ward heelers will see to it.
that the health inspectors walk delicately.
When Yic. Liberals started to rage last
month about his leadership of the coalition,
Premier Allan declined to get excited, and
described the demonstration as “letting oft'
crackers.” He was right. A weeks.reflec-
tion calmed the turbulent handful. Another
week, and they meekly left, it to Peacock,
who keeps the purse in Allan’s Ministry, to
arrange with Farmer John about, the sub-
jects to be discussed by a joint committee
of Libs, and Cockies. They even deputed
Peacock to select the five to go with him to
meet Allan and his five; and discussion of
the leadership of the pact (or pack) was
barred. A titled ironmonger and a prohibi-
tionist calico merchant made most, of the
fuss, but the capacity tor sustained fury is
not in them, and they arc now tamest of
the tame.
In Queensland the sugar industry is m
a tangle. The crop soared last yeat.
and 211.000 tons had to be exported and
sold at a loss. The foreign loss eats into
the local profit, and the closure of mills is
in sight. The biggest in the Mackay district
has already shut its doors, leaving over dUP
growers in the,lurch. If the great consuming
countries were also producing countries they
would put dumping duties on the exportable
surplus and pile disaster on top of mishap ;
but luckily they aren’t. The case is different
with butter. Australians thought Canada
would prove some sort of a market under tin 1
new treaty, but tin 1 Canuck has smitten the
finished effort of the cow with 3d. per lb.
more duty, making 3-kl. in all. on bis mere
say-so that the price charged was below that
prevailing here. If Australia would bmld
a few new towns full of factories it; might
cut its imports from Canada down to zero
and sell its butter and sugar to its own
artisans. Unfortunately low-tariff fools,
professional strike-makers, day-labor fan-
atics and Red politicians all combine to
prevent it.
Government control of price-fixing is very
useful at election times. Just before the
Queensland elections, the Board of Trade
fixed reduced rates for bobbing and shingling,
and reduced the rent of electric-light meters
from Is. 6d. to 9d. a month. These were
catchy bids for the women’s vote. The men s
vote was thought to be safe enough, so there
was no need to bring down the price of beer.
A penny a pot reduction would have made
an absolute certainty of the election.
Premier McCormack, like one of his pre-
decessors, walked at the head of Brisbane
Labor Dav procession, and by keeping his
neck stiff and bis abstracted gaze ahead be
may have avoided seeing who and what was
behind him. The what included unseemly
scu files between the police and the unem-
ployed, who sought to disfigure the sacred
occasion with placards and devices stating
that poverty and hunger stalked abroad, and
that absolute famine lurked round the cor-
ner. They were suppressed for the time
being, but not mollified. The McCormack
Government is accused of assuming _ a
haughty and huffy attitude towards the city
workless. But, then, nobody seems to want
anybody very much in Queensland these
days.
The last act of the A.N.A. Conference in
Victoria was to make as much of a fool of
itself as could be done comfortably in three
lines:—
The A.N.A. urges the Commonwealth to consider
the granting of a bounty to primary industries, to
be extended over a term of years.
What particular industries, and liow much
bounty, and how long a term, and the why-
ness of it all, and the wherencss of the
means for it all were left blank. The Asso-
ciation scorned detail, .just as Domain ora-
tors do when they demand that public money
shall be fished up from the vasty deep.
“Griffith Moses” writes: —
A political par. (B. 6/5/’2O) says a Victorian
farmer with £l5OO has gone into over 200 N.S.AV.
land-ballots (150 in 1925) and drawn nothing. The
writer says his “applications were refused because they
were not from an immigrant,” which looks like a
rather crude effort of imagination. There would be
a row in the Ma State if all the nice homestead-
farms were reserved for strangers, and when you
read the results of a ballot you may notice that
they arc not. lie goes on to state that there is
“something pretty rotten somewhere when a trained
Australian farmer cannot purchase a farm.” it
seems to me this agricultural Gummidge doesn’t
want to purchase a farm, of which there are thous-
ands on offer. It looks more as if he wants to
draw a cheap perpetual leasehold in the N.S.M.
Government lottery. The persecuted victim from
Victoria says he put m over 290 applications, but
among so many thousand applicants (lie mentions
2331 for a single block) he might easily fail
without anybody conspiring against him. If he had
attended 200 race meetings or taken 200 tickets in
Tatt.’s he might also have failed.
Ex-Senator St. Ledger calculates that the
Queensland Labor Government’s election
campaign cost the party between £40,000
and £50,000. He took, as a basis, the expense
of distributing Theodore’s pamphlet, "Queens-
land’s Progress Under Labor,” to 450,000
electors, but lie allowed only Id. a copy to
cover paper, printing, addressing and post-
age. Postage a loin’' cost a penny, and the
pamphlet (20 PP-, stapled, with stiff-paper
cover in two colors) could not be produced
for less than the copper of commerce. Like
much of the Government’s electioneering
literature, the pamphlet was a Government
Printer’s job. Whatever the cost, Queens-
land Labor’s publicity campaign was the big-
gest thing ever undertaken by a State politi-
cal party. The Federal Nationalists may
have spent more on occasion, but not much
more, and not often.

Many times in tlie past Tiie Bulletin has
suggested that the accounts should be accom-
panied by a review of the position, and
something of the sort is more necessary now
because of big and, presumably, important
movements in the accounts, with no hint as
to their causes or significance. There were
several last year.
Also, there was a change due to the in-
clusion of figures dealing with the Rural
Credits Department. A profit of £37 was
shown from the new activity; it is included
in the figures in the table. Although part
of the bank no less than other departments,
its operations have to be set out separately;
and instead of half of the profits going to
the Federal Government for sinking-fund
purposes, the whole lot goes to reserves
whose uses are detailed. The branch was
launched on September 14 last, upon an
amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act.
Its capital is to be provided from profits
from the note issue, one-fourth to be allocated
each year—the £126,190 in the December
accounts represents 25 p.c. of the profits in
the 34 months —and that percentage is to
be collared until the sum reaches £2.000,000.
Procedure is' briefly as fellows: —
Advances are made by the Rural Credits Depart-
ment, on the security of primary produce placed
under the legal control of the bank, to the Common-
wealth Bank, or to other banks, to co-operative
societies, or to such other bodies as are specified by
proclamation.
One of the department’s first operations was
to make advances on the security of. grain
lo existing wheat pools, enabling advances
to be made by them to wheat-cockies. That
the profit was so small was due to the earn-
ings being charged with preliminary exes.
So far as the aggregate baua is concerned
here are some December comparisons : —-

Savings-banks deposits are almost three mil-
lions more than at December, 1924, a reflec-
tion of the general prosperity, real and bogus.
Government deposits are not shown sepa-
rately ; and as the bank handles the Federal
Government’s funds and is banker for three
of the States, tin 1 significance of some of the
movements is obscure —-.just as obscure as
the source of the profits.
Assets compare with those at some previ-
ous dates as follows :—-

The note issue w 7 as £3,090,000 lighter than
at December 31. 1924. but unchanged com-
pared with June. Profits amounted to
£724,890. Hitherto the lot went to the Com-
monwealth Treasury. On this occasion
£126490 is transferred to the Rural Credits
Department. Previous profits from the Note
Issue Department have been: December,
1923. £711.761; June, 1924, £552,822:
December, 1924. £699,397; and June, 1925,
£578,578. This profit is the net revenue from
the investment of the money paid by the
banks and the public for the notes. At the
present balance £27,442,606 was thus in-
vested against a total note issue of
£53.890,226. The balance (all but a few
pounds) was in gold.

When the 2-1 p.c. bonus was added to the
10 p.c. div. a year ago, managing-director
Knox was gloomy about the chances of an
encore. Little notice was, however, taken
of that, and shareholders’ confidence in the
management’s ability to maintain the rate
was, of course, not misplaced—the 12 A p.c.
has come along again without further com-
ment. Notwithstanding, chairman Knox
last week succeeded in digging up rather
more than the usual number of skulls and
skeletons :
Much loss was sustained because roost of the crops
exceeded the cap u ity of the factories during the
usual season: cane crushed later contained 11 p.c.
less sugar. Despite efforts to reduce the area under
cane, partial crop failure will probably be necessary
to bring about the change. High Protection has
resulted in more capital being invested in the
industry than it can carry. Adverse weather con-
ditions will result in a 15 p.c. to 20 p.c. decrease
in the present crop, but there will still be a sub-
stantia] quantity for export. The co.’s return from
the 1925 crop was inadequate for the capital sunk and
the chances of the trade. Fijian production last
year exceeded the estimate, but marked absence of
rain this season will result in several mills being
affected to the extent of 20 p.c. The adoption of
the 44-hour scheme in N.S.W. and Queensland was
a grievous mistake which will add seriously to the
cost of living; and loss must follow the idleness
of plant and capital for the lessened working time.
Also the Adelaide refinery was badly dam-
aged by fire in February: over 12,000 tons
of raw sugar went up in smoke, but that
is the loss of tlie Sugar Board; the fact
that the raw sugar was not insured was
due to a belief, based on tests, that the risk
was negligible. The co. itself is faced with
the reconstruction of two stores and the rein-
statement of the main building and of tin:
damaged plant. Part of the expense will be
covered by insurance, part will be charge-
able to the depreciation fund, and a reserve
is available to do the rest. Interesting in-
formation this last, although the existence
of hidden reserves should not surprise the
most unsophisticated.
Visible reserves are becoming bloated, and
that fancy market-quotations fail to separate
holders from their shares is proof of their
large expectations. It certainly looks as if
something will have to be done. Formal
reserves and the undistributed p. and 1.
balance amount to £1,557,053 £191,357
greater than at the previous March, and
almost equal to the record of 1922. The
replacement and depreciation fund amounts
to £1,404,175, and most of that is certainly
accumulated profit. The extent of what is
hidden this Column doesn’t know, but a
management that can see a whole flock of
ravens on every door is likely to have made
quite sure. The co.’s gift-giving has been
frequent and expansive :-

closes :

other side, “stocks of sugar and balances

ment” are £1,085.424 less. Cash and de-
posits are £168.282 greater, and_ sundry
debtors and investments £2,210,256 com-
pared with £1,690,484 at March 31, 1925.
The gain in the last two items amounts to
£688,053. That liquid expansion, plus the
fact that there was a gain in total net assets
compared with 1925 of £288,459, will further
encourage the hopes of shareholders. There
are unfavorable factors, nevertheless. What
will happen when (if ever) the sugar indus-
try is told to look after itself? And it is
riot at all impossible that the time will come
when Australia will take much more kindly
to “mill whites” than it does at present.

The Primary Producers’ Bank of Aus-
tralia, Ltd. —Shores are £5 called to £l,
issued at a premium of £l. The premium is
got in with the first £ of capital, so a com-
parison between capital and premium re-
serve —the unused balance of premiums—dis-
closes the real progress made from year to
year. The first three items in the follow-
ing table give the position :

Advances, etc. .. 254,631 750,401 1,183,468
Furniture and fittings 3,166 7,358 13,022
During the past 12 months a further 54,035
shares were sold. Calls received within the
period amounted to £95,384. that sum repre-
senting the increase in paid capital. Pre-
mium reserve, however, increased by only
£2746. It may therefore be assumed that
£92,638 was taken for share-selling, estab-
lishment and development charges—a fine
relief for revenue. When it is considered
that to date t 281,794 has been expended on
those accounts, the £7691 accumulated profit
shrinks into more than modesty. Not that
a trading bank ought to be expected to show
profits in its first years. The promoters fore-
saw that it was impossible to establish a new
bank without making such serious inroads
into capital as to kill any chance of success,
and the premium was imposed to meet pre-
liminary and development charges. The
plan lias much to recommend it—from the
bank’s viewpoint; whether from the share-
holder’s the future will determine.
Although the management has decided that
all but £82,349 of the premium capital is a
fair charge against development, and that on
such calculations there have been profits
totalling £7691, estimates obviously have been
arbitrary. Under-estimate means that the
profits disclosed have been greater; if the
error has been the other way there may have
been a loss. During the 12 months six new
branches were opened, and 15 in the previous
term ; in all 47 branches and 26 agencies
were at work on February 28. Share-selling
activities have forced this wide expansion,
and with it a steady drain. Much depends
on how soon the earlier branches become
profit-earning.
The year 1925 was a bad one for the prim-
ary producer only in patches, and the P.F.
Bank was fortunate in that it did not have
branches in the droughtiest of the areas. So
the balance-sheet figures show some marked
changes within the period. Deposits increased
by £424,863—-a 45 p.c. expansion. No diffi-
culty was experienced in finding borrowers:
advances were £433,067 greater than at the
previous balance. The bank was holding
little more than £3 of outside money for each
£1 of its own funds, and that was very solid,
particularly as calls are coining in—on pre-
sent subscribed capital £107,900 lias yet to
be received. The P.P.. however, has not
reached a position where ordinary standards
in this matter can be applied. From another
angle the bank has more than common
strength—assets held liquid were 46.9 of
outside liabilities (it was 62.3 p.c. in the
previous year). But although that is well
above the 40 p.c. accepted as adequate in the
case of the established Australasian banks,
the P.P.’s probable necessities —in case of
trouble it might fail to get help from the
other banks —modify its apparent strength.
A helpful factor, probably, is the source of
deposits, a big proportion coming from share-
holders.
The fact that the. percentage of funds
held liquid has been reduced (it was
as high as 80.4 at the end of the first year)
and that advances have increased, will assist
profit-making. At February 28 depositors
and other creditors could see 265. 6d. visible
for every £1 of their money, while there were
net tangibles of 245. lid. for each £1 of paid
share capital. Nevertheless, shareholders
need not turn their thoughts to divs. for
some time. On the 472,043 shares which it
is assumed had been issued at the close of
the accounts, £107,900 was still due in calls,
and the full amount of £472,043 would de-
mand 10 times last year’s profit if 7 p.c. divs.
were to be paid— most of the shares issued
have been 7 p.c. prefs. It may be, of coui'se,
that most shareholders will consider the in-
terest of 2 p.c. which they receive on cur-
rent balances sufficient return for a while
(the management affirms that most share-
holders are also depositors), and it will form
a nice addition to their 7 p.c. when they
get it—if the practice of paying on current
accounts isn’t by that time discontinued;
other Australian banks have discontinued it
in like circumstances. Taking “free” de-
posits as averaging only £500,000 for the full
12 months, it meant a payment last year of
£lO,OOO in interest, equal to over 3 p.c. on
the mean of paid capital.
Given fair seasons and no national catas-
trophe, the r.P. should get through ; a more
definite opinion will be possible after the
next two or three accounts have been issued.
Meantime it is impossible to see clearly
what it is doing owing to the lack of detail
in the accounts. The established banks may
excuse their reticence on the plea that their
future can be judged by their past. The
I’.P. has not that excuse. It still is in the
development stage; still is living on the
premiums on shares; and it is due to the
public, whose deposits it seeks, perhaps even
more than to its shareholders, that it, should
give fuller information than it has thus far
done.

It is not so much that building-construction
in and around Melbourne took a sudden
spurt last term as that new labor-saving
machinery effected economies which are re-
flected in the profit figures. Last year the
gross was £24,740 compared with £19,861 in
the previous year and £27.630 in 1924. The
fact that taxation was £552 as against £1216
for 1925 also helped. The position at March
31 was very solid: liabilities (£1650) were
£llOO-odd less, while cash, current and on
deposit, was £18,820 —almost £7OOO more
than at the previous balance. In addition
there were Commonwealth stock. £5200: book
debts, £14,481; property, plant and other
assets, £122,768 : shares in other cos., £36,361.
No provision for depreciation was made out
of profits, although earlier allowances were
generally liberal. Assuming that the co. has
provided adequately, the position is quite
good. Divs., however, have been in and out
for a long time, the distribution generally
being in accord with earnings. The boom
in building, so far as bricks are concerned,
appears to have passed in Melbourne, but a
10 p.c. div. calls for only £15,000. and that,
at least, seems a basis for the current year.

High prices for lead and zinc keep B. H.
Block 14 financial, the September-March
campaign netting £18,831. Most of this
came from 23,064 tons treated at the 1 ro-
prietary’s mill. But the costs of this cus-
toms work are high; and, in view of the
short hours and exceptional, working condi-
tions at the mines, Alec Campbell, knowing
the difference to Block 14 between lead at
£2B and at £3B, warns his clan that the time
may be near when it will be a hard job to
keep the wheels moving. The co. still mines
some carbonates; but the grade is low
for Broken Hill. Finances are in good
order, as the co. owes only £4600 and
has the following liquids: Stores, £4921;
sundry debtors, £1200; bonds, £26,175; cash,
£28,050; and concentrates and ore on floors,
£15,302. The co., which for 20 years has
been living on odds and ends —marvellous
how many odds and ends there are in a once-
great mine!—can hang on yet awhile. Its
worst trouble in the event of a shrinkage in
prices will be that the big mines of the
moment will fix working conditions.

Holders of the 653,139 10s. ordinary shares
in Zinc Corp. (8.H.) will receive Bs. a share
for 1925, and the 245,692 20s. prefs. :10s. for
the same period. The second instalment of
ss. in each case falls due on July 1, the
ordinaries having got 3s. and the prefs. ss.
on New Year’s Day. The prefs. will also
receive 2s. on July 1 as the first half of
the fixed pref. div. for 1926. On their
1925 div. both classes of share will be hit
with the British income-tax of 2s. 4|d. in
the £. The amount to be squeezed from the
prefs. on the 2s. interim for 1926 has not
been assessed. The 10s. ordinaries are valued
at about 525. in the market, despite the big
drop in their products; and the prefs. are
about 30s. higher.

Bribbaree (N.S.W.) has advanced the
south crosscut 37ft. from the 150 ft. level
of the Bonanza shaft, and the winze south
at the 100 ft. level of the same shaft has
been deepened to 43ft. Result in each case,
mullock. Manager Williams says, in exten-
uation, that “although winze and crosscut
have not disclosed any further ore shoots,
the development of these two points is
necessary for the future working of the
mine.” Maybe. But it is not at all clear
what workings are affected, the Bonanza
being a goodish step from the parent mine.
Here the battery, running intermittently,
crushed 40 tons in a fortnight for 840 z.,
and the cyanide plant wrestled for a month
with 200 tons of sand for 390 z. The only
ore being pursued was at two points, with
these remarks: “No. 1 n.-w. level, in the
underhand stope north from No. 1 winze,
continued on 15in. good quality ore. This
stope is almost depleted. No. 2 s.-e. level,
at 24ft. below this level, stoping on a short
shoot of payable ore was commenced.”
# * # *
Great Britain Sluicing, Emmaville
(N.S.W.), will pay div. No. 106 of Is. before
the end of this month. The handy little co.
is in 10,000 10s. shares, and holders hang on
like glue. Their quarterly shilling endow-
ments come along with clock-like regularity,
and sales of shares in Pitt-street are almost
unheard of.
* * # #
The battery of the New White Crystal,
Ardlethan (N.S.W.), has made another
start, running three shifts. The board has
spent some of the proceeds of the November
shilling call on refurbishing the plant, so
delays should not occur. The start had the
effect of lifting shares to 2s. There are
150,000 of them, 10s. each, called to 6s. lid.
* * # *
Good words exude from 11. E. Phillips
about the Silent Grove mine, Torrington
(N.S.W.). Others have similar opinions,
but the stuff has been the very deuce to
handle. Phillips regards geological condi-
tions as favorable, and to his mind evidence
is strong that the tin shoots will live to
depth. So the shaft is to go down, and
proper equipment is to be installed. The
Melbourne co. at work has only an option,
but it hopes to keep calls off while develop-
ment is on by picking the rich stuff out of
any ore won. That is the safe plan when
working tin in situ, for it is as elusive as a
flea in a bed.
# * • •
The recent rains have delayed plant-erec-
tion at Manna Hill, Stuart Town (N.S.W.),
but practically all plant is now at the mine,
and production by the end of June is spoken
of. But that sounds like optimism.
* * * *
Queensland Antimony, Northcote (N.Q.),
has circularised holders offering the 20,000
reserve shares to the present holders of the
60,000 contribs. and 40,000 paids. Rights
will expire on May 28. The terms are
2s. down and 2s. in three months, making
the new issue fully paid. This will give the
co. the cash to reach the marketing stage
without making calls beyond the shilling
already paid on the 60,000 contribs. The
reason for so much speculative buying up to
500 p.c. premium is now clear. Those opera-
tors who have sold the atmosphere will be
faced with the problem of finding “rights”
to deliver, too.
Dr. Jensen replies to “Kerogen” (B.
8/4/26) :
(1) Tlie gas struck in the Roma bore was, as tar as
records show, in shale, but nothing indicates Assuring
in the shale. Many payable oil pools have been
struck in shales in other parts of the world, but it
should be remarked that there are sands below the
shale in the same series at Roma. As for the possi-
bility of the oil having been swept away by under-
ground waters, it is very remote, as the Lower Walloon
beds are very poor in water. It is the overlying
Upper Walloon beds that form our artesian series.
(2) The Longreaeh oil was waxy and inspissated
because it was met with on an unconformity—right
on a buried pinnacle of granite rocks, which probably
allowed leakage to take place before cretaceous
sedimentation.
(3) In my opinion the Lower Walloon rocks are
not all freshwater deposits. Evidence of estuarine and
deltaic conditions and of the salinity of the series
wall be available in full in my bulletin on the Roma
series now being published by the Q. Mines Depart-
ment.
(4) In addition to coals and carbonaceous shales
as possible sources of oil in the series, there are
abundant organic (vegetable) remains in most sand-
stones and shales of the series. No molluscan beds
have yet been found, but such are likely to occur.
The vegetable remains are, however, a sufficient source
of oil. “Kerogen” is incorrect in stating that post-
mesozoic foldings have had “little dynamic effect.”
In combination with pressure, salinity and possibly
heat, their effect has been quite as considerable as
in other regions with coals of the same carbon ratio
in which oil is found. Finally, as for the drilling
experience and the failure of bores to date to strike
payable oil, the argument is not worthy of “Kerogen.”
With the exception of the two bores at Roma which
met with similar trouble in the gas zone, and two
bores at Orallo which also met with drilling trouble,
all the deep bores in Western Queensland have been
sunk for water, and have* only penetrated the Upper
Jurassic water-bearing rocks, and even if they had
penetrated oil beds, water pressure would reduce 00.
manifestations to something imperceptible. The
failure of four bores all of which yielded oil indica-
tions in a State the size of Queensland, and with a
vast basin possibly oil-bearing, cannot be fairly re-
garded as a test.

Developments have proved good values in
both the north and south drives in the
3€oft. level of the Bushell shaft on the
Mount Isa lode: north, 19 p.c. lead and soz.
silver; south, 22 p.c. lead and 6oz. silver.
Values are over the full width of the drives,
with ore on both sides.

A good make of ore in the old Redcap
mine at Chillagoe (Q.) is reported. G.-m.
Goddard, of the Chillagoe smelters, is said to

The Radium Exploration Go. in the far
north of South Aus. has discovered a side-
line which it thinks may be more profitable.
At Parallana, in the Flinders Range, near
Wooltana sheep-station and close to Lake
Frome, is a hot spring, with water about
140 deg. where it comes out of the rock, and
said to have similar qualities to that of
Carlsbad and other much-boomed European
watering-places. Douglas Mawson and W. T.
Cooke, of Adelaide Uni., and sundry doctors
have given the place and the product a
good character, and a rheumatism-cure resort
is talked of. The route from Adelaide is
370 miles north by rail to Copley, and then
about 100 through rugged country but fine
scenery.

The New Southern Cross and Motor Fuels
Co., Latrobe (Tas,), is reported to have
produced 1000 gallons of crude oil during
March and April. Details of the run have
not been given, nor the quantity of shale
treated. Avery and Anderson, Melbourne
chemists and engineers, have taken charge
of the plant for a continuous run of one
week. The trouble with Latrobe shale is a
band of mudstone of varying thickness,
which lies between the upper and lower
seams. This does not contain oil, and has
to be excluded by liand-pickiug. Whether
Latrobe shale can be made to pay consider-
ing this extra cost is the chief problem to be
solved.

When the Gnow’s Nest mine (W.A.) was
inspected two years ago with a view to pur-
chase by the Brilliant Co., the show had
been worked out to the No. 3 level, and the
gold output had averaged 17dwt. Brilliant
Co. was advised to have nothing to do with
the mine, but, all the same, it muddled down
the shaft through a flood of water to No. 4
level. As anticipated, yields have decreased,
so a second inspection by another man has
been ordered.
* * * *
Someone is having a look at the Royal
Consols gold-mine, near Mt. Magnet (W.A.),
on behalf of Perth and Eastern State specu-
lators. A big and easily-worked body of
half-ounce stuff is said to be on the property,
but it will have to be well up to the stated
value to be worth having under present
conditions in the West.
The last may not have been heard of
Westonia. Having acquired the Edna May
Consolidated lease, a syndicate of working
miners has sunk a shaft 100 ft. in record
time. The idea is to drive from the bottom of
the shaft along the contact of gneissic rock
with greenstone for such horseshoe-shaped
high-grade formations as occurred in Edna
May Central and Consolidated leases. The
programme gives the party more than an out-
side chance.

Devon’s latest manager, the seventh since
1915, recently reported that things were
going smoothly on the co.’s Westralian show
and that additional plant had been installed.
Confidence has often been expressed by direc-
tors, but calls have been persistent and are
likely to continue.

Fred Tricks appears to have something
good in an option over a tin-dredging area
in Malaya. The area runs into about eight
square miles of country in the State of
Trengganu, and has been inspected by Jas.
Joice, who is supervising lode-tin operations
in the Straits Settlements. Joice regards the
show so highly that Tricks has agreed to
float immediately a syndicate of 800 shares
of £2O each to acquire the option. Other
than a refund of a few hundreds spent in
prospecting, Joice is asking no cash, but is
taking paid shares.
* * # #
Takuapa (Siam) confined applications for
its issue of 35,000 reserve shares to existing
holders, and aggregate requests amounted to
64,560. On a pro rata basis, applications
were heavier from “Eastern” holders than
from Australian. The co. will now be iff
250,000 shares—2ls,ooo of 20s. and 35,000
of 255. The considerable drop in tin to
about £270 consequent on the disturbed in-
dustrial conditions at John Bull’s head-
quarters has reduced current offers for Taku-
apa, ex-rights, to 325. Much water will, of
course, have flowed down the Takuapa River
before No. 2 dredge gets into action, but the
prospects of the co. with its 600 acres
should be assessed with that second string
in view.
• * * *
Ratrut Basin (Siam) will pay div. No.
18 of 6d. on its 150,513 shares on the 25th
iust. After a long lapse, divs. were resumed
last November —No. 16 of 6d. The 20s.
shares are at a discount of about 9s. owing
to the poverty of the returns from the new
ground taken over from the Siamese Tin
Syndicate. In this case it appears as though
second thoughts, which turned the area
down, were right, and third thoughts, which
accepted portion of it, were wrong. Still, the
board, having little in hand, couldn’t lift
the dredge to a distant site, so took an in-
ferior adjacent area to keep the show moving.
• • * •
Pulo Tin’s field manager, after inspection
of the options at Lanipi Island (Burma),
recommended that nothing more be done, as
only traces were found. The co. will hunt
now on the mainland. . : •

Taiping Tin (F.M.S.) has more Miles in
its personnel than in its area. In Penang
Arthur H. Miles is director and consulting
engineer, and the mine manager is Syd I>.
Miles. In Australia old Cap’n E. T. Miles
and A. T. Miles make up the Melbourne
board. That it’s a family job doesn’t mean
slipshod work. Two dredges last year belted
through 1,864,300 c. yds. of wash, running
time being 941 p.c. of the possible. That is
good going anywhere, and is a 2£ p.c. better
working result than for the previous cam-
paign. This was partly due to No. 1 plant,
which by roving about in shallow ground
was able to rake up 40 acres of wash.
Total output of 497| tons netted £75,052
against £84,080 for the larger yield of the
year before, the average per lb. being J.6bd.
against 10.78 d. Costs all round at 3.97bd.
are a shade below the previous records. No.
2 plant is in deep ground and only, got
through 181 acres, but a hew ladder is to
be installed to raise its efficiency. The co.,
by netting £41,856, was able to pay a -5
p.c. div. and write solid slabs off the two
dredges and tuck away nearly £5OOO to the
reserve. Another 36 acres has been .added
to the co.’s tin patch, so it can still go
strong under the Miles banner. The family
deserves all it gets. It has been a sticker.
* • * *
By buving 117 acres Tongkah Compound
No. 2 has extended its patch to 388 acres,
of which 100 acres is all that remains of the
old eastern ground. The dredge has been
working in .871 b. ground, and wdth tin. rang-
ing up to £290 a toil it has raked in the
shekels. In its 1925 run the plant turned
over 901,775 c. yds. of drift for 351 tons
oxide at a cost of 6.32 d. a yd. As the net
worth of tin won was 14.55 d. a c. yd., the
hefty profit of 8.33 d. went into the bank.
This is about l|d. better than in 1924, and
is explained by the drift being of higher
grade, and because oxide sold at an advance
of £ll Bs. a ton. With the new block added,
barrister Meagher can see another 15 or 16
vears ahead ot the co. He deserves success.
When he got the co. started five years ago
it owned only 250 acres. Now in the face of
steady dredging it has its 388 acres, and the
cash cost of jthe last purchase so far appears
at only £l7lB. Creditors are owed £2217.
and there is cash in hand of £19,285 as well
as Commonwealth bonds of £5233.

On the recommendation of its experts,
Taranaki Oilfields (ALL.) decided to quit
boring at Tarata. The hole had been punched
to 5000 ft.
* * * *
Kawarau (ALL.) has been heard again
after a long silence. “It is expected that,
the dam will be completed by the end of
.Tune, when mining operations should pro-
ceed without delay.” There is a temptation
to ask “Which June?” Meantime consoli-
dation of Kawarau claims continues, pend-
ing imprisonment of Lake Wakatipu. A
scheme amalgamating 51 claims nears frui-
tion, and 20 others are said to be willing to
join up when they see the Consolidated Co.
registered. This “wait and see” attitude
seems peculiar if July is to be the date of
the first delve for the truckloads of gold
which some of the optimists still expect.

Rand mine-owners are now treating ore of
less than 6|dwt. average, and have got costs
down to less than 4£dwt. The year 1926
therefore is doing w r ell in the latter respect;
the average cost in 1914 was barely half a
dwt. less. And the mines are much deeper
now than then ; also expenditure now in-
cludes much larger amounts for miners’
phthisis, which over there is a charge, on
the industry and not on a Government grant.

“Counter Hand” : The war of a generation
ago between Anthony Hordern’s and Lasset-
ter’s is recalled by the sale of the family
interests in both businesses. As far as the
firms themselves were concerned, hostilities
were mainly waged in the advertising
columns of the dailies, which had a bitter-
ness unusual in that part of any paper. Free-
lances made good money providing ammuni-
tion for the firing-line; one enterprising
scribe boasted of having sold a shot to one
firm, and, immediately afterwards, a suit-
able retort to the other. There was some
rival price-cutting on special lines, too; and
the vendetta spread amongst the employees.
In a cricket club with which I had a youth-
ful association, an old member, whose em-
ployment was with Lassetter’s, bunged in
liis resignation because, against his strenu-
ous opposition, a man who worked at Hor-
dern’s had been admitted; there was an
occasional clash of the rival firms carters,
and two office-boys appeared to have a more
or less regular appointment to fight tor
the honor of their respective firms in a city
lane. The daily mill was such a nuisance
that the police finally hauled the youngsters
to court, where an explanation of the feud
was given. Probably the firms acted on the
advice of the magistrate and warned the
loyal youths that any further combats would
earn them the sack, for the mills, which
had been regarded as a regular attraction
and were drawing increasing. crowds, sud-
denly ceased, greatly to the disappointment
of the public.

“S.T.S.”: The typewriter which addressed
the rival firm as “Gentlemen?” (B. 22/4/ 20)
was anticipated and outdone by one at a
seaside hotel in South Aus. A showy but
dubious-looking pair of strangers week-ended
there, and when they were leaving, the typed
account was rendered to “John Jones, Esq !
and Mrs? Jones.” The management stoutly
protested that the machine alone was to
blame, but the artist who worked it was
known to have had a difference of opinion
with the visitors the day before.

“Kerys” : A respectable Sydney suburban
couple were sitting in their small living-room
the other evening when they noticed soot
coming down the chimney in spasmodic show-
ers. A cautious, upward glance revealed a
large black object blocking out the sky;
presently a pair of shoes dangled over the
fireplace, and a youth enveloped in a motor-
coat, darkened with grime slid into the open
space. He seemed rather surprised at liis
reception, “Where’s the mob?” he asked,
blinking. Then: “Is this the wrong room?"
The suggestion that it w r as possibly the wrong
house seemed to interest him considerably.
"But isn't the party here?” he demanded
aggrievedly. An assurance that there was
no of any kind going on brought
him to explanations. A friend addicted to
practical joking had suggested his making a
spectacular entry at the party by arriving
per chimney, but with the humor peculiar to
the true practical trick-player he had led the
victim along to the wrong chimney.

“Sylvester” : In the golden days of Gym-

a couple walked iu-
to the Hibernian
Hotel and called
for pints. When
served, they pulled
wry faces over the
beer and com-
plained of the qual-
ity. A broguey
Bung tasted it him-
self and asserted
there was nothing
wrong with it; but
the schemers left
grumbling, with
their beer unfin-
ished. Presently a
couple more
strolled in, and the
same play was
enacted. After the
thi r d complaint
Bung concluded
that there was
really something
wrong with the
stuff, and, jealous
for his own good
name, took the cask
off and rolled it
out among his emp-
ties. After closing-
time the conspira-
tors removed it, and
a wild night fol-
lowed. But Bung,
after the joke had
been explained to
him, took it like a
sport, and even
paid the ringleader
a few shillings to bring the cask back.

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Inquiries are
often heard about the origin of two-up, and
where it was first played in Australia. I
remember “schools” in Melbourne away back
in the ’sixties. At first its devotees had
gathered in old quarries and on vacant allot-
ments, but presently the police drove them
indoors. The game, no doubt, developed from
the old English pitch-and-toss. Here the
players pitched the pennies to a line drawn
on the ground, from a certain set distance;
then the one who pitched the coppers nearest
to the line tossed them, and the others made
wagers on the result of the toss. Two-up
arrived when it was found that the game
could be better played without the pitch at
all, and with only two coins. It was talk
in the 'sixties that the new game originated
in Melbourne, but when, where and by whom
the change was made from pitch-and-toss are
GUTTING ON.
“I suppose you know I hare a flat of my own now?”
“Good business! Anybody I know?”
questions never likely to be satisfactorily
answered. In Melbourne in the 'sixties were
three brothers named Thompson—Joe. Jack
and Barney, all "sports." Jack indulged in
the “gloves." Joe became eminent as a book-
maker, and Barney followed .Toe's fortunes.
.Toe started two-up schools in Melbourne, and
it is quite likely he was the father of the
indoor game.

“Bill O’O.” : Speaking of married women
in business partnership with their husbands
(B. 29/4/'26), such alliances are not.
always what they seem —or are represented
to be, for commercial purposes, A West
Darling station-manager of the long ago
found himself condemned to eat a concoc-
tion of pumpkins and bits of string called
“Mugg’s marmalade” (that's near enough),
and this is how lie got stuck with it. There
was once a widow in Adelaide named
Chance, who established a great reputation
as a .iam-maker and founded an extensive
business upon it. “Chance's jam' was
popular long after the clever old lady had
retired and passed her boiling-pans over to
a manufacturing company. Alugg was an
incompetent rival, whose turnip and cara-
way-seed compositions were more sluggish
of sale. A commercial traveller reached the
station and found the usual difficulty in
trading off his consignment of Alugg. “We
want Chance’s jam,” said the manager.
“Oh, my dear chap, you can't get that now.
replied'the ready liar. “Didn’t you know?
Chance is dead.” (He had been and
truly dead for a decade or more.) “But
doesn’t anyone else carry on the business?"
“Yes, the widow did,” came the prompt
answer, “but it was a terrible struggle for
a woman, so she married Alugg, and it's all
one now. You’ll have to take a chance with
Alugg, like the old girl did.” Farther down
the river he was alleged to have united the
lady matrimonially to Crosse and Blackwell
(01343 or both), and he wrnuld as cheerfully
hafT 1 married her to Judas Iscariot if he had
been out to push Judas’s jam.

“Gile”: Copy of letter from a returned
soldier to a N.'S.W. Shire Council: —
With reference to yours of the 17th ult., I am
wondering if your Council -would support us in an
endeavor to have the Wingham-Oomboyne road
stocked with trout. The main road in the area men-
tioned is a very fine connected string of waterholes,
and I think that it would be a pity if advantage
were not taken of this condition. Of course if your
Council intends to go on with the repairs within,
say, 12 months, it would not be worth while approach-
ing’ the Fisheries Department.
After assimilating the satire, the Council hit
back with a solemn expression that the
writer was trying to be funny, but “hadn t
enough wit to manage it”—on which point,
however, there will be a difference of opinion.
“Feng-Slnii”: How much is Australia’s

“J.D.C.” : Deep-
sea vessels enter-
ing harbor and an-
choring in mid-
stream drop both
bow anchors. Then
they lie peacefully
until the tide turns,
when of course the
ship swings with
it. If the wind is
at the right angle
when the tide turns
again, the ship completes the circle in coming
hack to the original position, thus crossing
the anchor-chains and making it impossible
to raise the anchors. This perform-
ance may he repeated several times,
every complete turn putting another
twist in the chains. When the time comes
to raise the anchors, a tug is requisitioned
to hook on somewhere near the stern and
run round in circles to unwind the chains.
If there were one anchor at each end all this
trouble would be avoided; will some mariner
tell me why there are two at one end?

“FY7” : The bitter cries from N. S. Wales
stock-raisers objecting to the Australian
Meat Council's compulsory levy on stock
have a familiar ring. Years ago the first
Queensland Rabbit Boards Act produced a
similar howl. Part of my job was sending

“Lady thanks gentleman for kindness to daughter,

No doubt but you’re right, Missus ’Arris;
It’s a bit ungenteel, l’U allow,
Or, as they might put it in Paris,
It’s really not quite cum cel fow.
But w’at is a mother of daughters
To do, as ’er fam’ly expands?
It's a terrible faze, in these ’igh-livin’ days,
A-gettin’ th’ girls off yer ’ands.
Th’ men is as wild and as wary
As 'awks, an’ yer work is cut out
At smoodg'in’ to every vagary
Of some loafin', swelled-’eaded lout
Oo ’ints that ’is wages can't keep ’im
And a wife in th’ style ’e demands.
Ah, take it from me, it’s no Sunday-school spree,
A-gettin’ th’ girls off yer ’ands.
Take Ermyntrude, too—th’ suggestion
Of ’ousekeepin’ rouses ’er rage,
While service is out of th’ question,
And she ain’t got th’ legs for th' stage.
All me lady can think of is jazzin’,
Or sunbakin - out on th’ sands,
An' th' lads that wants wives, they don’t rush for

A-talcin' such girls off yer ’ands.
So, v’ see, one can't miss any chances.

In view of th’ young chap’s advances,
On follerin’ ’ot on ’is scent.

“Mr. T. Young, managing director of Cassell and Co., the well-known English publishing house remarked that Australia had the highest consumption of books per
head of any country. He was gratified at the size and dignity of our bookshops, and the high intellectual’status of our people.”
AUSTRALIAN BOOKSELLER (to Australian author): “Sorry, old man, but won’t you please push off and starve somewhere else? You're only spoiling
the er-dignity of the Australian hook-trade!”

“Roka”: Auckland beats even Melbourne
in the matter of a cenotaph for Anzac 1 lay
celebration purposes. It possesses a movable
one, which, built of fibrous plaster, resembles
white stone, and makes an impressive object
for the centre of ceremonies. On the eve
of Anzac Day it is set up near the Town
Hall in the middle of an ordinarily con-
gested thoroughfare, and after standing for
the day banked by memorial wreaths is
stowed away until the year rolls round and
it is time to give the boys another thought.

“Ilooshta”: In the dawnliglit our patrol
crept along a track above the Hebron \ alley.
A Turkish officer stepped jauntily from the
bend ahead. Harry's rifle cracked, it seemed
THINGS THAT SUP OUT.
"Jumbo and I hare just had out photo token—Beauty and the
Beast, you know."
“Yes; he is a beauty, isn't he?”
automatically, and the Turk, with a sur-
prised look, stood stock-still for an instant
with a bullet through his heart. We crouched,
waiting. Nothing happened. Long Larry
stepped forward and souvenired the Turk’s
silver cigarette-case. As In* lit up Larry
soliloquised: “Th’ poor cow little thought

aftor lin'd gone west.” A sudden machine-
gun stutter scattered us among the boulders.
We lay there the whole hot day long with
merely an exchange of courtesies between
patrols. In the warm afternoon I became
drowsily aware of a hum of bullets landing
somewhere near the one spot. I peeped
warily over my boulder to see what was
attracting the fire and yelled—Long Larry,
fast asleep, had rolled from cover and lay
spread-eagled to the heavens! “Strath,” he
gasped as lie eatlierinc-wheelod for shelter,
"i was dreamiir I was back among the old
man's bees.” I'd quite forgotten about it
til! the other day I read in my paper that
Larry's honey had just taken the blue ribbon
at the local show.

“John Stone”: The use of iron trees
for observation-posts was not eonlined to the
Germans l It. 22/4/'2(>) ; they were made
and used by the British quite early in trendi-
warfare. I saw a
line example in
front of Chapelle
d’Armen tiero s
a pollard-willow
about the end of
1916. Another of
these “ trees ” a
little fart li e r
north had the imi-
tation hark blown
off. and the decep-
tion was painfully
apparent. When
establishing these
dummies the real
tree had to bo re-
moved. and the

night: a mate of
mine was seriously
wounded while en-
gaged on such a
forestry job.

“ D.A.11. ” : C-o-
-incidences? In
N o vember, 1915,
I was evacuated
from Gallipoli and
sent in a hospital-
ship to Alexandria.
My principal im-
pressions of th e
voyage were a
phlegmatic sister
and a great econ-
omy in diet. Upon
reaching the con-
valescent stage,
I was drafted with
a squad of Tom-
mies on board a
hospital-ship for
England. As there
were over 40 hos-
pital-ships then in
M e d i t e r ranean
waters, 1 thought
it was long odds
ugainst my striking the same one again,
but I presently found myself lined up on
the quay at Alexandria alongside"that pre-
cise vessel. Obediently I followed the orderly,
and found myself in the same ward, and. my
guide turned away after throwing my worldly
possessions on the same cot that I had occu-
pied a few weeks previously.
“Pat Busilit' (B. 29/4/’2G) is
correct when he says “the soldier in court
is bound by civil laws like anyone else";
but lie's quite wrong- when lie says that no
person but a Jew while actually taking the
oath keeps his lid on. Aus. Military Reg.
218 says that “an officer or soldier will re-
move his head-dress while the Judge or
magistrate is present, except when on duty
under arms with a party or escort inside the
court.” King's Regs, say the same thing.
* * * *
“Mars”: I don't know whether a soldier
may wear his headgear in court (B.
2i>/4/’26), but I recall one who proved his
right to wear it at church service. It hap-
pened on a troopship returning to Aussie.
One wet Sunday morning, church parade, in-
stead of being held on the upper deck, was
held between decks. Captain Swank was in
charge, and, noticing a Digger with his hat
on, peremptorily ordered him to remove it.
“I won’t.” came the unexpected reply, where-
upon the offender was placed under arrest.
Paraded next morning on the charge of wil-
fully disobeying his superior officer, he re-
ferred the O.C. to King’s Regulations re
dress on parades, church and otherwise. They
showed that he was quite right, and hats
should have been worn. For the rest of the
trip Captain Swank wished that he had never
been. born.

“Adam’s Apple”: While quaintly-worded
telegrams are in the boom reference might
he made to the class of people who hate to
waste any of their l(i words. This one came
our way lately: “William . Possum Hill,
, Father sinking fast. Put quid both
wavs Lady Eurieka Saturday. —"

“Clerk” : “The Geelong Flier” commenced
running between Melbourne and Geelong on
May 8, doing the 45-mile run in TOmin. The
railway heads hope to lure custom from the
'buses by means of this train, which will
start from Flinders-street at 9 a.m. and run
non-stop to Geelong, returning at 4 _p.ni.
Comfortable corridor-cars will be provided,
and as the 'buses, although travelling at a
pace which is fast destroying the Geelong
road, take an hour and a half to complete
the distance, Clapp is splashing a good deal
of money in advertisement.
“Spare Corp.” : There was a variant upon
the Diggers’ razor joke (B. 6/5/’26)—a
satire upon the issue implement, the value
of which was officially over-estimated at two
bob. The captious officer, inspecting the
ranks, said sharply to a rougli-cliinned
private: “What’s the matter with your chin?
Have you lost your razor; You look as_ if
you shaved with a penknife.” To which
the Digger retorted promptly: “No, sir. Lost
mv penknife—had to shave with my razor.”
' * * * *
“Flagwagger” : How’s this for coincidence?
I enlisted at Melbourne in January, 1915.
without parental consent; as I was only li,
my. father interviewed the heads, and I was
discharged in February. I promptly ran
away from home and walked the 75 miles
to Ballarat to have another try. Realising
the necessity of finding a new name and a
fictitious parent who would be more accom-
modating than the real one, I cast about
for an alias, and learned from a talkative
woman in Ifumphreys-street that the male
occupants of the house opposite were named
Henry and William Blank, father and sou.
1 decided to be William, the son of Henry
Blank, and armed with a document setting
forth that llenry aforesaid agreed to lvis
son’s enlistment, I was accepted for service
at the town-hall recruiting depot. On Feb-
ruary 18 I was back at Broadmeadows, and
was presently drarted into A Company, 2Jrd
Battalion, i had only one tent-comrade of
about my own age, and naturally we two
young ’uns became mates and later close
cobbers. It was then I learnt that, like
myself, my friend had run away from home
and had enlisted under an assumed name.
That was nothing, but what was amazing
was the discovery that he was William
Blank, of llumphreys-street. Ballarat, whose
identity I had borrowed. Luckily for both
of us. Henry perc made no inquiries. When
his son cleared out lie washed his hands ol
him.
* * * *
“P. Pawnticket”: The expensiveness (and
grimness also) of some people’s jokes is
often .remarkable. I know a small employer
in Sydney, affable with his few workmen and
a constant victim of the earbiting of one
of them who would spring requests tor
small loans on unexpected occasions and sel-
dom remember to repay them. When Nip
died the boss opened his heart and under-
took the whole cost of the burial, even erect-
ing a headstone over the grave. Ilis post-
humous jest has cost him £65. but he
chuckles over it as he tells of Nip's expert-
ness in the extraction of spare dollars. Be-
neath the debtor's name and age is the line :
“Oh, for the touch of a vanished hand!”
* * -x- #
“G.F.” : A certain thrifty Senator from
N.S.W., annoyed by the ear-biting fraternity
who make Parliament House one of their
hunting-grounds, hit on the idea of always
keeping three or four pennies in one pocket.
To every request for a loan he would say
(producing the coppers), “I’m sorry, but I
only have my tram fares with me.” He got
the shock of his life when a seeker after five
bob snatched the tram fares with the re-
mark, “Well, that’ll do for a start, anyway.”
“C.M.”: Another convict-settlement fable
(B. 20/4/’26) is served up to tourists at
Norfolk Island. On a window-ledge of the
gaol at Lougridge (now the local Town Hall)
the name “Rufus Dawes” is roughly chis-
elled. to be accepted by many visitors as a
genuine voice from the past. The guide
generally carries a tattered copy of Marcus
Clarke's “Natural Life” to back up the tale.
I wormed the true story out of the wily
islanders after several months’ trouble. Two
of the old-timers, keepers of boarding-houses,
realising the value of local color, cut the
name in the stone years ago, and found it
an excellent draw. Actually, there, was never
a prisoner of that name on the island,
Clarke’s hero being a composite portrait of
Mark Jeffrey, Martin Cash and other cele-
brities of the period, whose reminiscences
(as well as the prison records in Hobart)
the author relied on for his material.

“Pink Tape’.’: A curious defence to charges
of burglary was raised in a Sydney court
the other day when the alleged Sikes de-
clared. almost with an air of injured inno-
cence, he had bought the goods found in his
possession out of the proceeds of a lucrative
sly-grog business. lie admitted that the
wages of sin, as represented by this industry,
had been lessened by £6OO in fines which he
had had to pay, but impenitently declared
A WAY FAT Hi: Its HAVE.
“Oh, indeed, and what would yon say if
someone ran away with me?”
"Ur—that he’d been misled about the money
I have: that’s what I'd say.”
that it had nevertheless returned him annu-
ally “more than the Crown Prosecutor, gets
—which may or may not be an argument for
raising legal fees. Probably, if the accused
had stuck to sly-grogging. lie might be still
owing as much income-tax as many a lawyer
has to pay; it was when he began, as a
side-line, to study death notices and bro ils
into the houses of people who might be
absent at funerals or too occupied with their
mourning to notice a stealthy itltender, that
the Law grabbed him for misdeeds that
cannot be wiped out by fim-s.

The latest victim of Melbourne crimin-
ality, Colonel Eric Tulloch. won special
distinction where all were heroes, at the
Gallipoli landing. Leading a half-company
of the 11th Battalion. Tulloch took his men
through the hail of bullets, and, moving
swiftly towards Battleship Hill, occupied his
planned objective. Only one other com-
mander, Captain Loutit, had a similar suc-
cess. Tulloch went through the war and
commanded the 12th Battalion in 1918. An
old Grammar boy. he was a colleague of
Stanley Bruce in the crew which won the
first contest in the Head-of-the-River series.

Frank J. Fleming, of ,T. P». Were and Son,
Melbourne, sharebrokers, has sold his last
parcel. lie was the doyen of the Stock Ex-
change. with a record of 45 years of dicker-

room of 15,000 Melbourne Trams at £8 15s.
t»d. to George Staples, now a member of the
London .Stock Exchange. No bigger trans-
action has ever been made openly in Mel-
bourne. Fleming, whom no surrounding ex-
citement ever ruffled, was one of the few
remaining links between the days of gold
rushes and silver and copper booms and the
present period of exchanging Government de-
bentures and brewery and drapery shares.
The history of Lassetters, which now
ceases to exist, the business having been sold
without the right to use the old-established
name, goes back to 1820, when Iredale
opened in George-street, Sydney. Frederic
Lassetter bought a share in 1850, but the
real rise of the business occurred when the
enterprising new partner, during the slack-
ness of city trade which followed the gold-
rush, decided to follow where the business
had gone. He trailed 20 team-loads of goods
to the Turon, and, accepting gold-dust as
currency, made fine profits. More valuable
still was the advertisement his enterprise
had given the firm amongst the diggers, and
ihe business grew rapidly. In 18(50 Lasso i-
ler bought out his partners and established
the business in his own name ; and in 1860
lu* erected what was then the biggest store in
Sydney. Lassetter came to Australia in his
childhood, and had a job as sales clerk with
Easy, a Melbourne auctioneer, at the age of
14. A few years later a Sydney man, G. A.
Lloyd, noticed the smart young clerk, and
lured him to Sydney by offering him £2 per
week, lie was only 21 when he bought his
share in the Iredale business —Lloyd financed
him in the purchase. His son, Colonel Las-
setter, who died only recently, had but a
half-hearted interest in commerce, and his
grandson, Captain Frederic Lassetter, appa-
rently has none at all.
May Holman, Australia’s third Assembly-
woman, has been more fortunate than Mrs.
Cowan was when she sought re-election for
West Perth. She won the Labor pre-selec-
tion hands down, beating her nearest oppo-
nent by 468 in a poll of 1249; and, barring
accidents, this means a walk-over next year,
for Forrest is as safe a Labor seat as there
is in the Commonwealth. And she deserves
it, for she lias been an active and forceful
representative of the timber workers, of
whose union her late father was secretary
for years.
The first step in the long and expensive
process of canonising the first Australian
saint, Mother Mary of the Cross McKillop,
has just been taken. Archbishop Kelly has
sent out an official SOS requiring all 'those
in possession of personal letters and writ-
ings of any description to send them to the
Tribunal of the Order set up in Sydney.
Horn in Victoria about 80 years ago, of
Highland stock, she gathered a couple of
women friends in Adelaide to work wfith her
for the alleviation of the sick and education
of poor children. Their first meeting-place
was a stable, and from those beginnings thou-
sands of nuns of the Order of St. Joseph
(the “Brown Sisters”), with convents and
schools throughout Australia, Maoriland and
the Islands, have sprung. Mother Mary died
in Sydney a decade or so ago.
An old man whose name is known in half
a dozen outside countries passed out in* Mel-
bourne the other day without causing a
ripple on the local pond. He was Robert
Byers. Thirty years ago, blind and para-
lysed, it seemed he had nothing to look for-
ward to but a life of uselessness and slow r
decline. Then he conceived the idea of a
mission to the blind of other lands. At the
end he was directing from his sick bed in
Windsor activities that extended to over IS
Asiatic and African countries. His organisa-
tion, which is to be carried on by a com-
mittee, is never likely to suffer from a
shortage .of supplies of objects for its
charity; in China alone there are probably
more people deliberately made blind every
year for purposes of beggary than the whole
institution could accommodate.
Five of the legal fledglings admitted to
practice by Yic. Full Court last week
attracted more than ordinary notice. Jack
Lawson is a son of the ex-Premier and
ex-Attorney-General; Russell Cohen, a son of
11. I. Cohen, M.L.C., K.C., an ex-Attorney-
General and present unofficial leader of the
House of Landlords; and Alan J. Moir, a
son of G. A. Moir, head of Gillott, Moir
and Ahern, and grandson of the late George,
of the same firm. The skirted wig-wearer,
Gladys Loats, and the brilliant blind student,
Dudley Tregent, who took up law after his
war service, also had a claim to interest as
they faced the C.J. and his colleagues.
Colin Colalian, the Melbourne young man
whose clever black-and-white work is well
known to readers of The Bulletin, is gain-
ing recognition in Paris, where he has been
painting for some years. La Revue Modekne
does not. stint its adjectives in speaking of
a portrait by him which was shown at the
Salon des Artists Frangaise. It is refresh-
ing to see a critic in that forcing house of
all that is queer and sensational in art prais-
ing this Australian for his sobriety, solidity,
natural truth and other unfashionable virtues.
Cricket enthusiast Berry Drynan, clean
bowled last week at 60, was one of the earli-
est of Hawkesbury College boys, left there
to go on the land, and settled down to horse-
breeding in the Liverpool (N.S.W.) district.
He was for many years a licensing magis-
trate, and every Easter saw him a steward
at Sydney’s big Show, adding to his tremen-
dous circle of friends.
It was personal pressure from Cardinal
Mundelein that induced Arch. Mannix to
join, the delegation of prelates from Aus-
tralia to the Eucharistic Congress at Chicago.
Dr. Mannix is no stranger to Uncle Sam’s
territory. He is a freeman of N'York—
like General Pershing, Edward P. and De
Valera.
Fate, which made Dr. Guillotin a victim
of his invention/ was in a similar mood when
it plotted that John Isherwood Schofield,
who introduced the first hand-cart ambulance
in Sydney, should take his last ride in the
up-to-date motor vehicle into which the other
has developed. Schofield’s partner in that
early ambulance movement w r as W. Spiers,
who is still on the staff of the Central District
Ambulance. Knocked down in Anzac-parade
by a motor-car last week, the pioneer was
hurried to Sydney Hospital with a fractured
skull. He died there three days later.
“G.W.A,” : Opening an evening paper the
other night, I read in an obscure paragraph
of the death of Vice-Admiral Sir John
Franklin Parry, formerly hydrographer of
the British Navy and since 1919 president
of the International Hydrographic Bureau.
Monaco. I remembered him as a ddbhing
young lieutenant in the Australian Squadron
at Hobart 30 years ago, where he married
one of the late Senator Dobson’s daughters.
And just here coincidence took a hand. I
turned from the evening paper to The Bul-
letin (8/4/’26) and began to read J. H.
M. Abbott’s “The Myall Pioneers.” The
very first name to strike me was that of
Captain Sir William Parry, R.N. The Arc-
tic explorer, who died in 1855, was, I be-
lieve. grandfather of the late chart expert.
I’ve hardly thought of either for years, but
struck the two names within 10 minutes.
BERNARD O'DOWD, poet and Vic. Par-
liamentary draughtsman.
Port Melbourne's oldest inhabitant, Henry
Moore, better known as '‘Black Harry,”
passed out the other day after spending,
according to the best calculations, 110 J years
on the planet. He was born in Jamaica,
arrived in Port Melbourne at the age of 29 Gr-
its neighborhood, and stayed there to the end.
Among the purple patches in his memory is
the unlading of the Thermopylae after her
record run of 60 days from London in 1868.
He was the third man to enrol in the old
Naval Brigade, and on his 109th birthday the
old chap was taken up in an aeroplane, and
relished the experience. He was married
three times, and he was his last wife’s third
husband.
Arrived recently in Maorilaud, with a
view to lecturing on world peace, Sir Henry
Lunn, head of a tourist agency which bears
his name and which owns 30 or more hotels
scattered over the Continent. Having made
his career a unique combination of religion,
philanthropy and commercial acumen, the
founder is now putting his business into a
eo. with international peace and church
unity as the beneficiaries. Among his other-
jobs in life, Lunn was once a co-worker
with W. T. Stead in semi-religious journal-
ism.
Wolf Harris, who has died in London,
aged 92, had an Australian connection —he
made his way to this country nearly 80
years ago, when he was still a boy. He was,
in early on the M.L. gold rushes, and did
well; and he built the first stone buildWg
in Dunedin—that city's maternity hospital
later owed its start to him and a few others.
One of his sons is a British M.P.
“Schnorrer”: On my second meeting with
the late Rabbi Chodowski I protested
against his eagerness to pay for the whiskies
—a habit of his. “My friend, in matters
of the spirit a minister should be allowed to
lead,” he said. I have had drinks with many
clergymen of many denominations, but Chod-
owski was one of the few who could breast
the bar without any furtiveness. He enjoyed
good drink, good company, good stories’; but
he might slip off into a profound argument
at any moment. The Talmud is a massive
library in itself, but: when, only a few weeks
ago, during his last illness, I wanted an
exact quotation from the Talmud lie gave
me chapter and verse after only a moment’s
thought. His generosity was magnificent.
Meeting an acquaintance in a state of desti-
tution. he took him home, fed and lodged
him, and gave him clothes—his best suit.
Mrs. Chodowski demurred—-surely a second-
or third-best suit would have done. “He
has to find a position ; the better-dressed he
is, the better his chance," was the old
rabbi’s final word.
“N. or M.” farewells a notable figure:—
Mrs. Jane Quintal, an interesting old lady who
was Aunt Jane to most of Norfolk Island and who
died there recently, aged 89, was daughter of George
Hunn Nobbs, of Pitcairn, and her mother was grand-
daughter of Fletcher Christian, the Bounty mutineer,
lhe oldest survivor of the exodus from Pitcairn, she
had a vivid remembrance of her early home and
could recall the comic-opera “revolution” engineered
by Joshua Hill. When George Nobbs went to England
to he ordained, on the invitation of the British
S.P.C.K., he took his daughter Jane as far as
Valparaiso and left her with friends to await hjs
return. The place was then a British naval station.
Jane, beautiful, vivacious and 16, became engaged to
a post-eaptain of the Admiral’s ship, who after-
wards won distinctions in the Crimea; but an
accident of undelivered letters, discovered years after-
wards, put an end to that romance. She eventually
married a cousin-—one of innumerable Quintals.
About four years later the community of Pitcairn
removed to Norfolk Island. Of the Bounty episode
and of Christian and Quintal, she spoke with
tolerance. “They did it for the good,” she would
add hastily. “That captain, he starve the people.”
An interesting sidelight on the causes of the mutiny
and one which goes to support my theory that the
trouble arose from Bligh’s refusal to allow the
sailors, when the Bounty was leaving Tahiti, to make
private hoards of provisions.
“Yacko’’: Captain Sturt —his birthday
fell on April 28 —might have been remem-
bered as an administrator as well as an
explorer if Fortune had been a little kinder.
Governor Darling proposed him as first Brit-
ish Resident of Maoriland, but illness pre-
vented Sturt accepting. On the recall of
Governor Gawler. of South Aus., Sturt sent
m liis credentials,but Captain (afterwards Sir
George) Grey was preferred. On tlie death of
Hotliam (Vic.), in 1855, Sturt again applied
for the post, and was again disappointed.
Finally, in 1859, on the separation of the
Moreton Bay settlement from N. S. Wales,
the residents petitioned the Colonial Office to
appoint Sturt as their first Governor. But
the Imperial authorities once again refused to
recognise the qualifications of the stout-
hearted and kindly explorer.
Two years ago The Bulletin had a para-
graph about a Miss 1,. Beech, baker, of West
Footscray, Melbourne, to whom certain
millers had refused to deliver flour, her sin
being that she sold her loaf profitably for
10d., instead of at the combine price of lid.
The courageous lady still carries on, and
though neighboring breadmakers have had to
reduce their prices to the same level, none
of them has been seen in the Bankruptcy
Court yet.
A little-known man whose influence in
Britain’s coal trouble will be very great, just
as , V* has been very great in most domestic
affairs in which Britain lias been involved
since 1916, is Tom Jones, assistant-secretary
to the Cabinet, who, although he has served
many brauds of Ministries, doesn’t disguise
his own strong Labor sympathies. Jones
was a miner s son wlio worked bis way to
Glasgow University, and from there to his
present high place in tlie civil service; but
bis heart is still with his own folk. Ho
has been the confidant and adviser of four
Prime Ministers—Lloyd George, Bonar Law.

just retired, claims
that he is the only
Australian - born
policeman who was
present at Queen
Victoria’s jubilee
procession in 18S7
from Buckingham
Palace to West-
minster Abbey.
The jubilee pre-
sents, which were
valued at two mil-
lion pounds, still
casually rise up be-
fore Cooper’s mem-
ory, like the recol-
lection of a mid-
summer-day dream.
“Uramao” : Nobody seems to know who in-
troduced bunny to Australia. Maoriland, how-
ever, knows the sinner to thank for the pest.
It .was Charles Rooking Carter, a builder
by trade, who arrived from England in 1857.
He was engaged on the Parliamentary build-
ings and other big contracts. Later he took
up land in the Wairarapa, where he liber-
ated rabbits; and for years it was a very
.serious offence to destroy rabbits on a squat-
ter’s land. Carter went in for politics later,
represented the Wairarapa on the Provincial
Council, and had the town of Carterton
named after him.
The cabled reports of the shooting by gen-
darmes of a famous Corsican brigand named
Ronee Romanetti, a picturesque ruffian who
had reigned in the wildest parts of the island
for the past 16 years, has one curious link
with Australia. Ronce was known to his
admirers and others as “the Corsican Ned
Kelly!”
POLITICAL TRAINING.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“ ‘Mussolini has been in gaol 11 times —not a bad
training for a politician/ said Canon Hughes at
the University Association’s lunch at Scott’s Hotel.”
A training, say you, reverend sir?
Mayhap you guardedly would hint
At things our statesmen never were
Inclined at any time to stint—
Their foolish words; when once in gaol
At least, perforce, they’d learn the lesson
of decent silence. Yet 'twould fail
To make a durable impress on
Their ranting windiness, I swear.
They’d soon resume their brays and hoots
Since gaols, alas, no longer dare ■
To tear a tongue out by the roots.
Ah, no—a training, reverend sir?
1 must insist that in this tag
You most undubitablv err.
Ao clever cop nor cunning lag,
However skilful he may be
In trickery or how t’ unearth it,
Could teach enough to each M.P.
To make the wasted hours worth it.
A trifling slip—but so a reed
May sometimes see a bullet swerve.
You mention, sir, not what they need,
But merely what they most deserve.
VICTOIUA.
HASEN.

“Two Seas” : It’s a good rain that eomes
at the right time for everybody. A lugubrious looking
squatter in a Sydney bar recently appealed to our
sympathy by saying he had lost the whole of his
sheep during the cold, wet snap. A neighbor of his
told us later that the stricken grazier’s sheep was
given to him by a passing drover because it was
too weak to travel.
* * * *
“Rip” : Lately a girl name to visit us in
the Monaro. She was slim, fair-haired and fashion-
able, with nothing much on, and city-polished to her
pink finger-tips. Five mad men had been trying
for a couple of hours to catch a madder horse in
our 10-acre paddock. They cornered him, and he
leapt through their guard; they got him across the
creek near a fence, and he bolted back to the
distant hilltop. It was a hot day, and they were
all on foot. The girl was watching the fun. They
had the horse cornered again, and two of them
whose tempers were played out picked up handy rails
to hurl at the huge grey rebel standing trembling
and sweating, his eyes blazing hatred. As one
NOT REALLY A BAD BOY.
“Don't yon know it’s very wicked to steal money from my pocket?
Why did you rob your father?”
“Well, please, father, there wasn't anybody else to rob.”
rail shot out the girl ran towards the men, deaf to
her relatives’ screams. “Put down those rails and
give me the rope,” she called. The amazed men
obeyed. She started walking slowly towards the
horse, talking all the time. “Were they going to
hurt you, poor old fellow? Did they throw a rail
at you?” she cooed as she drew in close. The
grey did not move. Then her hand touched him.
He shuddered once, the rope was slipped round his
neck, and she stood patting him. The rest of us
roared applause, but the five mad men made no
sound.
“Sport 7 ’: Can any Councillor put me on
the right track ? I have always done well with the
rifle at stationary shooting, but fast side-on shooting
with a shotgun always beats me. Should the shooter
follow his target with the gun and keep it on
the move while and after pressing the trigger? I
miss continually, and cannot find out where 1 am
wrong.

“A. 8.” : Tom Smith, who “sknn” the dead
sheep on Niggeranderoo, fell ill, and the cook’s mate
swore softly in sympathy with him. “It’s the cussed
water; that’s what it is,” said Tom. “I’ve drunk
all sorts of rot-gut in me time and never had no
trouble. I lived for six months on that brine at
Mulligan’s Well, and there was th’ stuff we drank
at Bull’s Gully and th’ soak where the blacks used
to wash —you remember what sort of pizen that was.
But, now it’s rained and I’ve got that fresh water
from tlie homestead, I’m screwed up proper.” And
Tom groaned again, and the cook’s mate said it
was a fair cow.
* * * •
“Jimmy Possum’’ : I don't want to get
into an argument with “Soda,” who probably knows
more about* toxins and antitoxins than l do; hut if
powdered charcoal merely absorbs without neutralising
the toxic properties of strychnine, as he states (B.
25/3/’2C), how does lie account for this? A young
medico who claimed to have discovered a complete
antidote to strychnine poisoning demonstrated its
efficacy. Taking a dose of the deadly powder, lie
immediately gulped down his antidote, which was
nothing more or less than powdered charcoal, and
suffered no subsequent ill-effects. If I am not mis-
taken, it, was wood-charcoal that was employed.
Bushmen who believe in the remedy prefer pinewood
charcoal, which gives a finer and softer powder than
most hardwoods.
“W.J.C.”: It is true that vegetable charcoal is
inefficient in the absorption of organic compounds
compared with animal charcoal. Nevertheless, given
proper conditions of preparation and structurally
correct timber, wood-charcoal of very high absorption
value is possible. Norit, from European spruce, is
a well-known absorbent and widely used in industry
in Europe and America. Now the Yanks are making
their own, research having shown them that they
have suitable timbers in their own back yards. Gas
absorption is a similar business to alkaloid absorp-
tion. A volume of certain wood-charcoals, pulverised,
will absorb 900 times its volume of ammonia gas.
“Wingella”; Powdered charcoal is hard to beat
as an antidote for any poison. It is said to be
the best possible remedy for ptomaine poisoning,
and is almost always at hand if needed, if a lump
of charcoal is cooked with any meat of which the
cook feels doubtful it will improve both the taste
and the appearance, and will also ward off am
ill-effects. Very finely-powdered charcoal is invalu-
able as a dusting over poisoned wounds, and is a
thing that no bushman should be without, since
its uses are manifold.
“Iioka”: Maoriland naturalists are won-
dering whether the small birds that are usually the
victims of the shining cuckoo’s aversion to home-
building have become aware of the imposition, or
whether the cuckoo is developing parental instincts
again. Several observers during the last season
have been intrigued to find a mother cuckoo feeding
her own ravenous offspring. But whether the cuckoo
is forsaking its evil ways, or foresees the end of
its race if a strike or even a go-slow • policy is
followed by the foster-parents, has not yet been decided.
In one case a pair of small birds sat by and looked
THERE WERE OTHERS.
“Aha, mushrooms! But I suppose all the bin ones arc on top
of the bag.”
“Oh no, mem—not alt Some are on top of the other bags.”
interestedly at the exhibition, so possibly mother
cuckoo was showing them how she wanted the feed*
irg done.
“.Tcobb” : Certain aboriginal tribes of the
Northern Territory have definite lines of birth control
within their own boundaries. The other day I came
across a point-blank refusal on the part of a lubra
to go to a certain locality on account of what she
considered the far-too frequent
visits there of the Stork, A
station-owner in the Brock’s Greek
district was in need of a ton pie
to attend to his garden, and
whilst in town tried to induce
a more or less civilised lubra with
her buck to go bac-k to the station
with him, some 25 miles away.
Much to his surprise they refused.
Pressing for the reason, the lubra
in embellished language stated that
the station was “too much picca-
ninny country !” On further ques-
tioning he was told that “all
about lubra that way gottem
plenty piccaninny,” and was
forcibly reminded that all the
females on his station accounted
for large families, whereas in
Brock’s Creek itself a piccaninny
was a rare sight—this probably
on account of the quantity of
opium which finds its way there
and is distributed amongst the
abos. Further pressed, the lubra
confided in the owner that his
place “always the same” as the
piccaninnies come from the spring of
water with which his garden was
fertilised and from which the
domestic supply was drawn. “All
about lubra catch him that way,”
she concluded.
* * *
“Wingella” : I have never
seen a case of diarrhoea in the
Northern Territory that has not
yielded to gum arabic. I have
seen it tried successfully on a baby
of six weeks and an old man of 82
years. In the absence of the genuine arabic article
I have used wild plum-tree or other edible bush
gums, and with like success. A missionary in West
Africa, to whom I sent my prescription, tells me
that it acts like a charm there, where dysentery is
a scourge. The action of the gum is to coat the
stomach and intestines with a thin film, thus giving
the raw surfaces a chance to heal. It may be
taken powdered on bread, mixed with milk, or
eaten by the lump, and it does not deteriorate with
keeping.
“Ctdnb”; The hypothesis that it is possible
for the human system to build up immunity against
the effects of snake-venom as the result of frequent
bites by poisonous
snakes gets no support
from the case of a lady
sn a k e-expert well
known in the show
world in N. S. Wales
and Queensland. This
lady has been handling
venomous reptiles of
all sorts, from the
death-adder to the sea-
snake, for more than
a dozen years, and in
that period has been
bitten over 300 times,
the scars of nearly 200
of the bites being
\ isible on her feet,
legs, arms and hands.
The snakes which have
bittten her have in-
cluded practically every
one of the better-
known varieties, and
although it might he
thought that in conse-
quence she would now
have a physiological
protection against their
venom this is not so.
She still experiences
symptoms just as
severe as those which
followed the bites re-
ceived when starting
her unpleasant calling,
and is firmly of opinion
that, although over 50
different snakes of the
black variety have
sunk their fangs into
her flesh, it would be
quite possible for her
to die from the effects
of a bite by one of
them were she not to
attend immediately to
the punctures. The
same applies to the
other snakes she
handles, the majority
of which appear to be
ever on the look-out
for a chance to bite
her. She does not use
any special antidote
when nipped, bu t
scarifies the wound
with a sharp knife
and, after making it bleed freely, puts some potas-
sium permanganate crystals in it, and then drinks
several cups of hot and strong coffee to overcome
the fat'al inclination to sleep.
“Ento” : The discussion on grafts and the
variety of fruits to be gathered from one tree reminds
me of a “sport” grown by Tas. orchardist Bourne.
ALMS AND THE MAN.
“How arc you crippled, poor fellow?”
“ Financially, Madam.”
•Exactly one half of an apple—not an apple-tree—
was Roman-beauty (the graft), the other half Senator
(the stock), the line dividing the two being sharply
defined. Artist Dechaineux made a painting used in
botanist Rodway’s paper on the subject in the pro-
ceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania, 1915,
whilst I made a futile attempt to preserve the
freak for the Hobart Museum. There is a fortune
awaiting the man who can produce this and similar
hybrids for New York’s crazy dinners.

“Bill Bowyang” : There are still some
clever aboriginal trackers in the Far North. In
the vicinity of the
Roper Ri\ t, a dusky
tribe recently plun-
dered a prospector’s
camp. A blaektraeker,
Culbo Charlie, was em-
ployed to follow the
robbers, and tracked
them for Go miles over
gibber country and
through swamps. At
one stage the thieves
never put foot on
ground, but swung like
monkeys from branch
to bran c li through
coastal scrub. Eventu-
ally the fugitives were
overtaken. Recently,
when Bert Armstrong,
employed at Forest
Home station (N.Q.),
lost his headings in
the hush, Tom m y
Richards, a nother
blaektraeker, was in-
formed that the miss-
ing man was mounted
on an unshod house
with a small split in
the near fore-hoof.
Richards followed this
animal’s tracks over
country that had been
grazed by thousands
ot horses and cattle,
and did not lose the
trail even on a stretch
of hard, stony lance-
wood ridges. The abo.
found the missing man
alive and well after
tracking him more than 50 miles.

The TOP'NOTCH’ScotcM
“Wingella” : On Thursday, March 25, Dar-
win saw an unusual sight—a complete halo round
the noonday sun. It was dazzling—almost too
brilliant for the 'unshielded eyes—-of rainbow, hues,
in a wide circle, with an inner band of delicate
opaline tints. It extended to a distance of about
six times the sun’s apparent size. How often do
these “sun-dogs” appear? I haven’t met a Terri-
torian who had previously seen such a vision of
dazzling beauty.
STARTING HIM FAIR.
"I suppose you'll be doing a hit of riding, Choom?”
“ Oo, yes, bai Jove!"
“Ever ridden before?"
“Well, no—as a matter of fact.”
“ We’ll get you a horse that’s never been ridden, then, and you can both start off scratch.”
“Hebuberne”: Thrilling notice in large
letters on the wall of a North Island (MX.) pub:
ALL DRINKS FREE
The line beneath is in little, letters too small to
read till you get quite close to it. It reads:
from adulteration.
“By corry,” say’s Henare, “tat te sirrv joke.”
* * * *
“Atherton”: In the Daintree jungles
(N.Q.) thrives the father of all worms. Sometimes
he is sft. long and
has a chest measure-
ment of 3in. He bur-
rows into decayed
vegetation. For wear
)”> has a bright purple
robe or a dark green
shirt, but on dark and
drizzly days you can
see him glowing
amongst the blackenc-d
leaves in an overcoat
of phosphorus. H e
has a comical method
of progression. First
he. secures a rump
holt, then shortens his
body into a thousand
stout rings; next his
head reaches forward,
then the wrinkles one
by one unfold, and he
becomes a tremendously
long, narrow worm.
When fully extended,
he grips something
ahead, puts his
shoulders down and
draws up his wrinkled
body. His domicile
often spreads for yards
underground, and he
can travel there at sur-
prising speed. I
watchedj a wild pig
rooting after a worm
with grunts of antici-
pation. Suddenly he
ceased w T ork, sniffed in
all directions above
ground, grunted again,
and some yards further
on made the leaves fly
once more. But he
missed again and the
sniff-locating was re-
peated. His anguish
was heartbreaking
when his snout told
him that the under-
ground dinner had
got beneath a bank too deep down for snouts.
* * * *
“Gip” : A young Irishman remarked to me
how strange it was that so many people had failures
with their cauliflowers. He said he had a beautiful
lot coming on now and hadn’t done a thing for
them at all. Having had some experience, 1 expressed
my astonishment. “No,” he said, “I just dug the
ground a eoupla feet deep and flung in a load of
stable manure and then I planted ’em. After that
I just sprinkled a bit of bone-dust around each
plant, and when they come on a bit I give ’em some
liquid, manure, fowl and dairy mixed, and keep
hoeing around ’em.” “And the grubs never tackle
them?” I inquired. “Oh, well, I sprinkle tobacco-
dust on ’em every few days, and at night I go
down onc-e or twice with a lantern and pick the
snails and slugs off them. Me gran’mother can put
x thing in upside .Jown an it’ll grow, so I never
go to no trouble at all, but just let ’em take their
chance.”
"Two Seas”: There are weak points in
that yarn (B. 22/4/’26) about the man on a nor’-
western station who passed off 40' hand-made dingo
tails a month for three years at 10s. a time. No
man with sufficient experience to obtain the job
of receiver of noxious animals’ scalps would be
such a mug as to accept, a tail only as proof. He
would want the mask of the animal connected to
the tail by a strip down its back. This blocked
the very ancient swindle of getting paid for the
scalp in one district and the tail in another.
* * * *
“Namoi” : Has any member of the Coun-
cil come across a willie wagtail with pronounced
powers of mimicry? One little chap spends the best
part of hia time on the rail of our front verandah,
opposite the canaries’ cage, duetting with them.
Now, after some months’ tuition, his trilling whistle
is as sweet and prolonged as any canary’s; indeed
some of his deep notes are sweeter. Discussing our
little wonder with a neighbor the other evening, she
opened her eyes. “And that explains the canary’
1 searched high and low for the other week! ” she
exclaimed. “I remember the only bird in sight was
a cheeky little willie!”
* * * *
“Nitric”: The discovery of a giant dino-
saur is of great interest to the world’s geologists and
biologists. Four hundredweight of fossil bones found
recently at Durham Downs station (Q.) formed the
nucleus of the reconstruction. The caudal vertebra
excavated were 18in. in height and weighed 30lb. each.
The tail evidently consisted of a rapidly’ tapering
sel’ies of bulky elements, and in this respect it differs
from specimens of the dinosaurs from other lands. A
recent discovery of a dinosaur in Mongolia by an
American party of scientists lends interest to the
Australian specimen for purposes of comparison. At
the present time the British Museum has an expedi-
tion in the Tanganyika district of East Africa, where
the remains of a reptile exceeding 100 ft. have been
found. A unique feature of the Australian dinosaur
is the large size of the neural canal in the anterior
vertebrae of the tail. This enlarged area in some
dinosaurs has been referred to as a supplementary
brain, and may be actually’ larger than the brain
itself, which in giant forms may be 30ft. from the
head. The possession of a large “tail brain” is
of particular interest.
Narara” : A Ilawkesbury River orehard-
ist makes for his own consumption excellent light
wines from orange and guava juices. He uses them
as table-wines, and they compare very favorably
with the lighter grape vintages. Incidentally, he
keeps a supply of brandy which he distils from nec-
tarines. In my opinion, this spirit is far superior
in taste to peach or apricot brandy, and is strong
enough to shift a corpse.

“G.S.M.”: “Buttenderry” states that tbo
very thorough digestive processes of emus, magpies and
crows result in the disintegration of grains, thus
rendering the subsequent germination of seed im-
possible. I have seen prickly-pear growing among
the emu droppings in paddocks. But, then, pear
will grow anywhere and under almost all conditions.
A piece of it on the mantelpiece in our Lands Office
has been there for 25 months, is still alive, and if
placed anywhere near the ground would certainly
send down rootlets.

“W.J.C”: “Porky Pine” (B. 25/3/’26)
records a poison formula which combines soda
with strychnine. These two are flagrantly in-
compatible, and rather than hasten the demise of
warrigals soda is calculated to prevent it. Strych-
nine has a water solubility of about one in six
or eight thousand, and admixture with soda will
lower this. Before the drug can act, solution must
take place; therefore, strychnine is generally put
up in more soluble form—in acid combination,
generally as hydrochloride, which has a solubility
of one in 43. The incompatibility of the soda lies
in the fact that its strongly alkaline action neutral-
ises the acid radicle tacked on to the alkaloid and
liberates the practically insoluble true strychnine.

“Jesmond”: While using the old chaff-
cutter the other day the case of the machine broke
into five pieces. There was no knock, and the
machine was running true at the time. The casing
was not subject to much strain, and there was no
apparent flaw in the iron; in fact, the whole
machine had been in use for about 12 years. The
makers’ explanation was (hat the iron was “tired.”
They assured me that “tired steel” is one of the
problems'’ that experts have been unable to fathom,
and that the man who solves the mystery is liable
to make a fortune. It seems that if 1 had given
the machine a rest for a week or so the iron box
would have regained its strength, and would prob-
ably’ have lasted for years longer. But how is a
man to know when his tools and implements are
getting weary?

“Larrapinta” : Here’s the reason why the
native wall-paintings mentioned by “R.D.D.” (B.
B'/4/’26) are nearly all of left hands. Binghi,
when in an artistic mood, used to take a
handful of powdered charcoal in his right
hand, place his left on the rock surface, fill his
mouth with the black powder, and blow it at his
hand, continuing until the rock all around it was
covered. He then removed his hand, and there
was the stencil. If melted fat was first rubbed
on the rock, the imprint would last indefinitely,
provided it was sheltered from the weather. The
boomerangs would be done in the same way, and I pre-
sume the two right hands were done by a left-handed
abo. Another artistic method was to trace around

BELLBIRDS ON THE PRINCE’S HIGHWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I ve been away to the Wonboyn, where the stately
black swan sails;
And I’ve talked with the big Gann River man who
carries the lighthouse mails.
Oh, I’ve picked up a lot to think about on the road
to New South Wales! .
I have memories sad and glad and bad, I have
memories grave and gay.
But the prettiest thing that I recall—
Oh, it’s not the view from the old sea-wall
Or the maidenhair by the waterfall,
But the tinkling of the bellbirds on the road to
Twofold Bay !
Do you know the trees in the Maffra streets? They’re
as green as an English lane.
They’re not like the gums on Donna Buang, all
gnarled and parched for rain.
Lnder Vereker-trees you can stand and watch great
flights of swan and. crane.
But all the trees are beautiful in their own peculiar
way;
And it’s back to the trees I love to go,
Though none has a thing as good to know
Or music as soft and sweet and low
As the twinkling, tinkling bellbirds on the road to
Twofold Bay !
I’ve sailed in a sea of fire from the Well to Nar-
bethong,
I've travelled far by the smoke-dim stars beyond
Briagolong;
And I’ve seen the trees alive with flame instead of
with wing and song.
But up on the road to Eden still the boll birds chime
all day
With a far, faint ringing that quaintly steals
Like an echo of fairy chariot wheels—
Oh, ever now in my’ memory peals
The ringing, winging bell-chimes on the road (c

STOCKINGS
The big rally of last week was the Citroen
Cerise Carnival. It got its name from the
baby Citroen, first prize in a slogan com-
petition which was penned in the vestibule
of the Ambassadors, and from the Cerise
Carnival at Nice: Mrs. A. C. Godhard, who
is one of the pillars of St. Margaret’s,
brought back the Riviera notion. The flush
of a gaudy sunset covered the Ambassadors.
Hundreds of men walked like prize gee-gees
with silver and cerise halters about their
necks. Girls in skirts that billowed, girls
in feathers and girls in silver wigs flashed
in a stream of color from ballroom to palm-
court. Eleven debs, in silver, clutching
cerise posies, fluttered before the State
Exes. They, poor darlings, had arrived at
nine, when they thought the last of the
bones would have been thrown under the
tables. But, alas, when the “God Save”
was sounded, many a man and maid were
but saying how d'you do to the whiting.
Lady de Chair dazzled the eye in gold
la mg and silver lace mingled with pearls of
great price. Tall Captain Penfold, rather
like a youthful and lean Quixote, was in
attendance, and in contrast among the
mighty were Hugh D. Mclntosh and organ-
iser George Fitz Patrick. After Mrs. God-
hard, in a cerise evening frock, had
shepherded the comers-out to the dais, she
popped off to the dressing-room and emerged
a sort of cerise and silver Columbine.
Sculptor Bertram Mackennal, looking like
an escaped banker, and his lady, in luscious
apricot, cast the eye of discernment over the
fancy costumes. Florrie Leach caught the
judges with an arresting head-dress, and a
wedding group of late Georgians, who flung
the charm of swelling skirt and rose-lined
bonnets into the welter of the bizarre, were
others to carry off prize banners. Dr. Lang-
ton’s lady, silver-wigged above her cerise
georgettes, looked very handsome. Lee
White kept on smiling after the curtain,
went down at the Palace, and came on to
the Ambassadors in flame chiffons and
feathers. Elsie Prince, too, hurried round
after Nanette was put to bed, become
queen of the carnival. In a bacchante
frock of wine georgette to which crushed
silver grapes seemed to have given their
hearts, ELsie was cari’ied in triumph ai’ound
the ballroom. A Swinburnian head-dress of
silver and cerise grapes cascaded to her
shoulders, rippling to the music of “I Want
to Be Happy” that the orchestra beat out
during her progress.
Hans Heysen, who is running a successfxxl
show of turkeys and South Australian atmo-
sphere in Farmer’s, was cheered by the
Society of Artists on Fi’iday night. The
jollo linked the names of the artist and his
wife, and was a merry-and-bright mixtui-e
of talk and laughter*, gramophone jazz, weak
jokes and fruit-cup. President Sid Smith
stage-managed the gathering, with strong
support from Thea Proctor and Adrian
Feint—Adrian runs the Grosvenor Gallery,
where the incense was wafted to the nostrils
of the visitors, and Thea, who is the tenant
ot the _ Hat above, loaned everything from
the polishing-mop to her own shining sitting-
room for the supper. Art was there in
layers. Bertram Mackennal brought his
wife, whose black marocains flung out a
glitter of rhinestones. Mrs. Heysen and
daughter Josephine were wrapped in moth-
like colorings—mother in grey velvets blush-
ing to a coral-pink scarf, and Josephine, an
attractive youngster, Breton-looking with
her dark plaits close to her head, in geor-
gettes, delicate as a lilac anemone. Pauline
Watt brought father Ernest, still all things
to all men. Pauline wore one arm in splints
and the rest of her in a lace frock. Joscelyn
Gaden, in a flowered blue frock, was another
who kept the altar-fires burning till the arri-
val of the Pavlova company. But neither
l avlova nor Novikoff materialised; only
Maorilander Thursa Rogers and another
pretty creature named Jervis rapped at the
door about midnight.
Overlooking the ruin that was once Hyde
Park stands the new, spruce Y.W.G A Vice-
royalty wiped its feet on the front doormat
one afternoon last week, ran its eye from
rigging to engine-i*oom, and declared the
craft seaworthy. The G.-G.’s lady opened the
front door with a flourish and a silver key
and with the support of the State vice-
reine came through the ceremony with fly-
ing colors. Mayoress Cecilia Walsh, too
bestowed a smile on the venture, and a
padre of every church radiated the higher
thought about the passages and common-
rooms. From the Y.M.C.A. came president
Arthur Cocks and secretary Kenny; solid
citizens like the Kelso Kings, Fairfaxes,
Hugh Denisons, Meekses (soon to be mourn-
ing. the death of Victor, their only son) and
Philip Streets dressed the front of the house
during the speechmaking; and the worthy
function ended in a personally-conducted
lour. The bedrooms are small, but dazzlingly
clean. Four shillings will buy you one of
these nests for a night. But there is no
liaison between bed and breakfast. Yon have
to dig out another piece of silver for this.
Do the pleasant girl workers in the Bush
Book Club realise that they are not labelling
and wrapping books, but fitting out argosies
of romance and galleons of adventure? Does
Beulah Bolton, the secretary, pause to think
that, in giving out the postage-stamps,
she is in reality singing a song that may echo
through generations. Possibly they don’t.
But to one sitting on the shiny yellow seats
at the Royal Colonial Institute listening to
voices that droned monotonously or were
pleasant but inaudible concerning Bush Club
affairs, there was joy in the image. On one
thousand eight hundred and six out-back
posts (and that’s to be read literally) the
magic packets of the club drop as manna from
Heaven. No wonder gentle praises issued
from the lips of Lady de Chair.
Peggy Dawes chaperoned Monte Luke the
other night at the Maytime Ball down an
avenue of pretty feet and ankles. These
were exhibited in contest, the purse being
two pairs of superior glass slippers. Monte
made a bashful enough herald, but finally
decided the A-grade crystal pair would best
fit the feet of Miss T. Williams. Miss A.
Doyle chassed in second, and Miss Bireh
third. The committee of the ball was made
up of the youthful enthusiasts who are the
Sydney Hospital Auxiliary. Mrs. Arthur
Winn was president of the frivol in a box
whose sides were pillars of light wherein her
brocades glowed like amethyst surrounded by
brilliants. Felicity Coyle, in coral-pink vel-
vets ; Mrs. Val. Osborne, in silver-splashed
black softness; and Mrs. Fiaschi, in lilac
georgettes, were others whose raiment caught
the eye and lingered in the memory. The
cold Palais has been turned into something
that looks like a pantomime Hall of Light.
Radiators blink at the dancer from the least
expected places, and really there’s enough
heat in any one of them to cook the break-
fast bacon—if you start early enough.
“Heather for all the luck in the world!”
said Gerald O’Hanlon when he met Heather
McGoll, and he kept on thinking it so hard
that last week at St. Mary’s the lass’s colonel-
dad gave her to him for keeps. Three good-
looking maids followed the bride’s silver
train and chenille-embossed georgettes, and
nearly 100 guests were in for the toasts at
the Ambassadors. Bridegroom grows sheep
near Queanbeyan. The honeymoon is being
spent among Marie Petersen’s jewelled
nights of Tasmania.

Mrs. Reginald Locke now, of Warrawee.
The gyves were clicked at the Lindfield
Methodist Church, Limerick lace and gold
tissue giving moral support to the bride,
while five bridesmaids and two train-bearers
in magnificent array of pink and apricot
taffetas added to the pictorial effect. The
cake and trimmings were spread in the

The Feminists are busy screwing up the
electric fans in their clubrooms these days,
for on Friday afternoon they entertain that
bit of thistledown named Pavlova, and it
would never do to whisk her suddenly out
of the windows over King-street. Only mem-
bers may attend, and that would be a good
motto for the Institute of Journalists to
adopt. Lately it has become the custom
to shunt real members on to the balcony and
to the seats farthest away from the guest of
honor while the ’Eads and their relations
have buzzed about the great, even as the
small advertiser buzzes about the Herald
olfice.
A girl back from England last week was
wearing a waistcoat that would have turned
Beau Brummel green with envy. It was
fashioned in brocades that combined the
shades of the damson and the golden plum.
Its collar was high, its buttons of steel
looked as if they were hand-wrought, and it
had several pockets. With it was worn a
costume of stone-grey tweed, the coat just
hip length.
If you have ever been to gaol you may
know the awful oppression that weighs upon
you from the
moment you
step within
the first gate
and find your-
self in what
resembles an
enormous steel
cage, locked
and guarded
at each end.
This is the
vestibule to
the prison
yard, across
which, at Long
Bay, there is
generally a
wind blowing
—a wind that
romps and
tears in a
madness of
freedom. Not
a happy spot
to spend a Saturday afternoon in, yet the girl
in this Judith Fletcher picture, Florence
Pettitt, makes the pilgrimage with her music
every month. With her she takes a band of
troubadours in an effort to bridge the gulf
of silence between the prison colony and the
world of the free. Not so easy is it to sing
and recite and strum your guitar on the
stone steps between the two pulpits in the
chapel which form your stage. Not so easy
facing the rows of intent men who have ex-
changed their names for numbers, and the
gallery where women’s eyes mark time in the
changes of fashion in every detail, from your
shoes to your hat. For your background you
have a fresco done by a forger of bank-notes,
and the parquetry under your feet was set
in place by silent rows of numbered men.
An oppressive place! Yet year in year out,
once a month, Florence Pettitt, magnificent
accompanist and clever musician, takes to it
a concert party. The personnel of that party
changes, but Florence Pettitt is always its
leader.
Miss Sarah Hynes thinks that national
possession, the Ellis Rowan collection, still
lacks a vital feature —a picture of the ethe-
real, bird-like lady whose life-work it repre-
sents. So Miss Hynes has set out to form
committees in the different States to raise
funds for a portrait of the artist. Victoria
lias taken kindly to the scheme, and a com-
mittee with a University flavor is already
hard at work.
After an absence of four years Mrs. Laurie
(iCoralie Morgan Jones she was) has re-
turned to her native land. Her husband is
a relative of the famous Annie, “whose face
it was the fairest that e’er the sun shone
on,” and is proud of the connection. Mrs.
Laurie, who is leaving in a week or so for
a round of visits to country cousins (her own
folk are Forbes station people), was wel-
comed home by many old friends at the Rose
Bay Golf Club’s small and early on Satur-
day night.
A note from Rome:—-
The stalwarts who in every Lent protest against
the opening of the Sydney Show on Good Friday
may be heartened by recent proceedings in Italy.
This year Mussolini made a very definite decision,
and all theatres and cinemas were compulsorily closed,
while the national flag flew at half-mast from all
Government buildings. Next session he has decided
to introduce legislation to make the sacred anniversary
a day of national mourning. Incidentally, the usual
crowd of enthusiasts from all parts of the world
assembled at St. Peter’s, Rome, on Good Friday tc
hear the Pope’s Choir sing the Miserere. The
rendering was an exceptionally fine one. Monsignor
Rella was prominent among the dignitaries at the
high altar. This old patrician, who has the airs
and graces of a picturesque prima donna, has now
“bobbed” his hair; but except for this shortening
of his silver locks he looks just as he did a dozen
years ago when he captured the hearts of the Si dney
faithful.
The cheers which urged Sydney High to
Victory in the Ilead-of-the-River champion-
ship eights were the death-knell of poor
young Harold Packham, regarded as one of
the coming champions of that school. He
rowed in the Second Fours which won last
year but in. November he slipped whilst
taking part in a gymnastic display. A
broken neck, at first thought to be hopeless,
was fixed by two surgeons, and, though
paralysed at first, he was climbing back to
the use of his limbs when the regatta came,
and he was allowed to travel out in a chair
on a launch to see the event. He enjoyed
the excitement, but caught a chill; and pneu-
monia brought a sudden end.
I tied last week at the Towers, which had
been her home for 13 years, Mrs. Floyd, the
pretty, dark-haired Irishwoman who was so
widely known and loved. For years Mrs.
Floyd ran the employment branch of Stott
and Hoare’s, and many a flapper starting
out in the business world had the sympathetic
lady to thank for the happy surroundings
of her first job.
Bumpy patches on the mountain road were
factors the other day in making a long motor-
ambulance run to cheat death a failure. Ir
became imperative that an operation should
be performed on Mrs. Jane Barclay, wife of
a Katoomba padre, and a motor-ambulance
started the race against Time and Death.
It took five hours to deliver the patient at
the hospital, where the operation was imme-
diately performed; but in the delay the
patient had become too weak to stand the
shock. The difference between life and death
was just that between the smooth speedway
that motorists pray for and the rough road
that exists.
A girl with an Irish name was standing
quietly in the middle of the room at the
studio party. The hour was late, the flow-
ing bowl was just in its last lap, and the
great artist who had jigged incessantly about
the rooms, roaring with Homeric laughter,
decided to make a final jest. He made an
impressive passage up to the girl, held out
his hand, and announced: “Now' I know
your name. It is Murphy.” The girl looked
at him sw'eetly. “You’re wrong,” she said;
“no doubt you’d remember it better if it
w'ere Hennessy!”
Miss Brisbane’s record of a busy week: —
There was summery weather for the May race
meeting at Ascot, and the cloak-room was full of
furs and coats all the afternoon. The Q.T.O. band
played, and several tea parties were given on the
committee-room verandah, Mrs. Stuart Henderson and
Mr. Pat O’Shea being amongst the givers. Mrs. .T.
L. Woolcock wore a burnt-apricot hat with her
cinnamon and brown frock; Mrs. Robert Thompson
was in biscuit with moss-green hat: Mrs. Eugene
Hart was sheathed in fawn with a black hat; and
Mrs. Halford, in black over purple, with daughter
Kora in oyster silk.
The Russian invasion has been taken in a cordial
spirit by Brisbane, as the fulness of the Exhibition
Concert Hall has testified, wherefore the Cossacks
decided to give an extra concert as well as a matinee.
“The Volga Boat Song” and “The Red Sarafan,”
being the best-known numbers, got furious encoring.
The Slav colony turned out en masse to welcome its
brothers, and there was much “off” and “vitch” on
the tramcars.
A rival show at His Majesty’s, which has kept
“Paterfamilias” and “Mother of Ten” busy writing
to the papers, is the stark drama “White Cargo.”
At Wednesday’s matinee Leon Cordon’s throat was
obliged to take a rest on the “Oh llelis!” and his
understudy worked on the part. When one considers
flic kind of thing that passes in vaudeville and
musical comedy without upsetting Mrs. Grundy,
morality seems to be a matter entirely of clothes.
Deck your vamp in the latest civilised fashion of
undress and your hero in Oxford bags, and you won’t
have letters written to the paper by “Mother of Ten.”
Knight Sid Kidman and his lady, who are going
north by the Malabar, stayed at Lennon’s for a
day or two.
The Brisbane Needlework Guild has had its display
of garments at Mrs. Frank Corrie’s home in Bowen-
terrace. In its 27 years the guild has given nearly
7000 articles to charitable institutions. Mrs. Corrie
received in navy cr6pe de Chine, and there was
a musical programme. Pink and red roses were
on the tea tables set about the lawn.
The Country Women’s Association is having its
big week in Toowoomba. Mrs. Fairfax is retiring from
the position of president, and Mrs. E. Farmer (Harris-
town) takes her place. Mrs. Annand, T’woomba's
Mayoress, presented bouquets to several of the dis-
trict heads, and the Mayor spoke a piece* congratulat-
ing the C.W.A. on its good work. Mtrs. Gerrand.
Brisbane’s representative on the Bush Nursing Council,
said she hoped her hobby and the C.W.A. would
some day work in conjunction.
Yellow cabs will be seen here in July, it is
expected. Nearly an acre in Leichhardt-street has
been bought for a depot.
To entertain the captain and officers of the
Wangaratta, Tom Welsby’s home, Amity, was lent,
and flags enclosed the verandahs for dancing. Chry.
santhemums, gum-tips and wistaria decked the lounge,
and Emmie Stewart’s orchestra played. MJss Welsby,
in black, with Paris lace and poppies, gave the
glad hand to the big roll up, which was swollen by
officers from the Port Auckland and Peshdwur.
The Women Grads, had their annual at the
Bellevue at a round table dressed up in ijoyal blue
with golden and brown chrysanthemums. Freda
Bage, the president, was amongst the diners,
President and Mrs. Charity were at homfe at the
Windsor Bowling Club to a crowd 200 strolig. Pen-
nants flew and roses and gerberas were or! the tea
tables. Mrs. Charity wore brown, and Merdyn Rees,
who is soon to be married, was preserved with
cutlery.

MISSESE MONKE DOVLE
Phones central 1532, 1533.
The tragedy of the shooting—presumably
by a burglar—-of Lieut.-Colonel Tulloch,
Melbourne Grammar School’s coach, in the
early hours of Saturday morning, made the
Public Schools boat-race a sad affair. The
M.G.S. crew was in the finals, and hoped
to carry off the Fairbairn Cup and Ilead-
of-the-River honors. With the tragic death
of their coach, which the lads felt very
deeply, their interest went, almost entirely.
A meeting, hurriedly held, decided to hold
the afternoon’s race, but to abandon the rest
of the programme, including the formal
presentation of laurels to the victors, who
turned out to be Scots College. Though the
weather was cold and wet on Friday, about
:>O,OOO folk saw the heats rowed, and enthu-
siasm ran high. The finals, which came off
in fitful sunshine on the following day. drew
at least 80,000 people to the banks of the
Yarra. Imposing launch-teas were given by
Admiral Hall Thompson and his lady, by
the Arthur Robinson couple, and by Dr. and
Mrs. Shu ter, he being president of the Old
Grammarians.
Lads and lassies to the tally of about
:;00 made merry at No. 9 on Friday night,
when six mothers with sons at Geelong
Grammar united to give their young folk a
Imppy time. The pale blue of the _G.O.S.
appeared in pennons among decorations of
gorgeous flowers and balloons, and favors dis-
tributed to the guests helped to create a
carnival atmosphere. Of the hostesses Mrs.
J. M. Pittendrigh wore deep rose georgette
veiled in fine gold lace; Mrs. Frauk Andrew,
a robe of black chiffon 1 velvet; Mrs. A. R.
Lempriere, a black gown with cheer of silver
and blue brocade; Mrs. W. Campbell Guest,
a frock of dregs of wine shade, enlivened
with patterns of silver beads; and Mrs.
Essington Lewis and Airs. Hubert favored
gilt covering in lace and lame. Pat Lem-
priere was charming in deep apricot, and
Sue Parker danced in a pretty green
covering. Alison Vereo, a visitor from Adel-
aide, wore delphinium blue. Elsa Andrew
carried her two fair plaits over shot-blue
taffeta. The debutante of the future is likely
to coil her back hair again, judging by the
vogue among schoolgirls at this party, who
braided their locks in two plaits —-a pleasant
change indeed.
The Old Xaverian Association experi-
mented this year by holding its annual hop
on the eve of the Ilead-of-the-River race;
and though the school’s crew had suffered
defeat in the heats no one was downhearted.
The crimson and black formed a gay canopy
over some 450 dancers, and lanterns bearing
the old and new collegians’ badges dangled
from the galleries of St. Kilda Town Hall.
Crossed sculls at intervals gave the right
topical flavor. This first-of-tlie-season affair
brought many new gowns from their wrap-
pings, and there was a great glistening of
sequins and beads. One of the pretties!
robes seen for a long time was Elaine Gib-
son’s, its filmy shaded-pink foundation scat-
tered with the palest rose sequins. Kathleen
Ahern’s pastel-green satin suggested a
Chinese robe with its wonderful twinkling
embroidery. Mauve and pink georgette, with
termination of a frill of apple-green tone,
was Madeleine Page’s contribution to the
color scheme; and Justice Cussen’s daughter
Alice, who brought her brand-new fiance,
Charles Morrissey, was in white, chalk-
beaded. Notable among smartly-gowned
matrons were Mrs. W. C. Carrigh, in a scin-
tillating blaek-aud-erystal frock, and Airs.
F. E. Keane, whose geranium-red had em-
bossing of gold.
The entertainment tax collected on Satur-
day must have been close to a record. The
“House Full” sign was everywhere, for the
world and his family seemed to look upon
it as a duty to be out that night. Theatres
and dancing resorts were besieged by hun-
dreds ready to grasp any cancelled tickets,
and leading hotels fed multitudes. At Meu-
zies’, where knight Arthur Robinson, as pre-
sident of Old Scots’ Collegians, toasted the
winning crew, and Air. J. Calvert had some
Geelong rowers, about 600 were catered for,
and there were similar feasts in most Collins-
street hostelrics. At the Windsor, where
the Alelbourne Grammar crews and their
friends were to have made merry, the flag
was half-mast to honor Col. Tulloch’s mem-
ory; the dinner was off, and the theatre re-
serves of the guests were disposed of.
Boat-race Night found patrons of the
boxes at His Majesty’s gazing at the “Yeo-
men of the Guard” from a framing of autumn
foliage of oak and maple bordered with chry-
santhemums. Front-row galleryites and
dress-circle folk leaned over flag-draped
balustrades linked with garlands, caught up
with clasps of flowers; and a central decora-
tion of the d.c. was a miniature four skiff,
with the light-blues manning the blades.
Colors of all crews spanned the dome, and
college banners and badges were exhibited
above and around the proscenium. Rarely
lias the theatre looked so beautiful on a gala
night. Gaiety was added by hundreds of bal-
loons tethered to the chairs, aud by members
of the audience who came on from jolly
dinner parties wearing paper caps and armed
with more balloons and favors.
The purple and gold of Wesley College
gladdened the Palace Theatre. Flowers,
streamers, balloons and lanterns of the colors
decorated balconies and boxes, and the
nautical touch was given by crossed oars
displayed on either side of the proscenium.
The players of “The Nervous Wreck” entered
heartily into the night’s fun, and Frank
Neil’s appearance in a college jersey caused
a riot of laughter. Boxes were occupied by
representatives of the Old Collegians’ Asso-
ciation—the hon. sec. and his wife; Mr. and
Mrs. Wesley Ince, and Attorney-General
Fred Eggleston.
At the Princess Theatre, where the win-
ning crew (Scots’ College) celebrated their
victory, college songs brightened the inter-
vals, and streamers thrown from all parts
of a packed house made a lively tangle of
the final scene of “Mercenary Mary.” The
leading lady not unnaturally resented the
fusillade, and even before her marcel wave
was disturbed by a well-directed shot she
was merely “walking through” ; she left the
stage before the final curtain, not even
bothering to claim the wonderful flowers
handed up for her, including two wee skiffs.
The rest of the company entered into, the
spirit of the occasion. College colors, shields
and badges, trails of flowers, flags and lan-
terns decorated the theatre, and a joyous
evening closed with showers of balloons fall-
ing upon the stallites.
A hop at the Kooyong Tennis Club gave
opportunity for about 250 people to con-
clude the Head-of-the-.viver celebrations very
pleasantly. The crews’ colors had pride of
place in the decorations, which once again
were the work of Vera de Bavay and Ger-
trude Bedggood. Both wore apparel of
zinnia red tone; Miss de Bavay’s had silver
beading. Dr. Esmc Anderson, just back
from the Big Smoke, where she collected a
new degree or two, showed a very smart
ombre frock shaded in tones of biscuit and
fuchsia, with big velvet bows at the back.
Another maiden also introduced this “bustle”
effect upon her green taffeta frock. Dr. Jean
Littlejohn figured in black georgette, and
Kathleen Rogers-Thomson halted the eye
with similar material of gobelin blue.
Lovely woman being no longer required by
convention to adopt the role of the seen but

sions, the

A s s o eiation
has formed a
.special class
for members
anxious to
learn the art
of public
speaking, and
the lady who
will help them
to entlivate
(lie charms of

smiles out of
this window.
She is Isobel
Duncan, who
gleaned most
of her know-
ledge from the
late T. A. Sisley. Lately she used her
talents in a production of “Charley’s Aunt.”
which added £l5O to the Mayor’s Bush-fire
Fund. A recital of excerpts from the works
of Shakspeare is being kept in view by the
elocutionist, who also conducts classes in
English at the Workingmen’s College.
Dal Monte, who returns with a fuller
voice than she took away, received a regu-
lar thunderstorm of a w’elcome at the Audi-
torium. Old admirers were there to hear
her beautiful notes and hand over tall brown
baskets of chrysanthemums, dahlias and
gladioli. The singer appeared first in a frock
of straight line, which seemed in the foot-
lights’ glow to modulate from dark amber at
the hem-line to ivory at the corsage, and
which glimmered with crystal in line and
embroidery. August© Beuf, the big, broad-
shouldered baritone, got a cordial greeting,
and pianist William James came in for a
share of the audience’s enthusiasm.
Melbourne’s smartest parked their limou-
sines and sedans around the Playhouse when
gt. Catherine’s pupils, under the guidance of
Nellie Veitch, put on a show to help the
Children’s Hospital. There was a fairy-
tale play, a rainbow fantasy, some bits from
“The Merchant of Venice”---mercifully not
the Trial scene—and W. D. Howells's “Mouse-
trap.” The elocution was good, and the
dressing elaborate, delighted parents and
friends showering flowers and other gifts
upon the young performers. Deirdre Gran-
tham, Shirley Campbell, Joyce Turner (as
Portia) and Addie Shackell (in a male role)
covered themselves with glory.
“The Devil’s Disciple,” one of Bernard
Shaw’s trio of “Plays for Puritans,” which
has just had its first presentation by the
Repertory Theatre Society, gives opportunity
for some attractive dressing. Of the period of
the American War of Independence, when
mere man was encouraged to have extrava-
gant notions about his clothes, there was
a resplendent array of satin breeches, lace
frills, jabots, curled wigs, three-cornered
hats, flowing capes, bright uniforms and
other fal-lals dear to the heart of the
gallants of that time. The ladies of the
east also made a brave showing in pan-
nier ed gowns of chintz and sateen over pet-
ticoats of varied hue. poke bonnets, frilled
mob-caps, fichus and long cloaks.
The eager-eyed, sleek-shingled maiden here
pictured by Lafayette is Morva Davies,
daughter of
th e C, G.
Davies couple,
of the E., S.
and A. Bank
at Horsham.
She is the pos-
sessor of an
unusually pro-
mising con-
tralto voice,
which is to
have expert
guidance by
some great
C o n tinental
teacher. The
lass, who sail-
ed the other
day, is to have
a few months'
holiday in
England be-
fore she be-
gins to lay the
technical foundation of a concert-artist career.
Twice she lias captured the championship
honors at the South-street competitions, so
she faces the future with some confidence.
It was a sort of musical cocktail that was
offered at the Melbourne Auditorium by the
University Symphony Orchestra, the recipe
being four parts of Wagner to one part
each of Reinnecke aud Tscliaikowsky. The
Russian was represented by the Concerto in
B Flat Minor, with Edward Goll at the
piano. After an inauspicious opening pianist
and orchestra made creditable headway, and
achieved a good finish. Bernard Heinzc got
the best out of his instrumentalists in the
beautiful prelude and closing scene from
“Tristan and Isolde,” and gave an attractive
performance of the Prelude to Act V of
Reinnecke’s “King Manfred.” The “Val-
kyrie” selection was labored, but the large
audience gave it an ovation.
Vida Muriel Sutton, who as a member of
the Melba Opera Co. sang in minor roles,
had a star part when she stood up in wed-
ding array of ivory chenille-embossed geor-
gette over a shimmer of silver and pale pink
and said “I will'’ to Lieutenant Albert Victor
Tonkin, D.F.C. The bride, who is the only
chick of the W. J. Suttons, of Hawksburn,
hall an attendant matron-of-lionor in Mrs.
H. G. Ilowe, who wore powder-blue and
silver; and a bridesmaid. Constance Tonkin,
the ’groom’s sister, wearing a pretty gown
of cyclamen hue and silver lace. The guests
were feasted at the Oriental.
Edith Swinburne, third daughter of the
George Swinburnes, is off to England, with
much fine trousseau and many wedding pre-
sents, for she is to marry over there Dr.
Clifford Ellingsworth, superintendent of the
West London Hospital. Last week Marea
Lucas and her two sisters put on a special
jazz at their Toorak home to farewell the
bride-elect, who not long since returned from
a trip to Europe. She was one of the Aus-
tralians presented at Court last year.
Thelma Lee, who was married in London
last week, is a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
John Robert Lee, former residents of this
city, but now in Harley-street. The bride-
groom was Dr. Stanford Howard, youngest
son of the Rev. Henry and the late Mrs.
Howard, formerly of Adelaide, a Rhodes
Scholarship winner. A brother of the bride-
groom had the smithing contract. Some of
Britain’s bluest blood and a string of Aus-
tralians crowded in to the reception. Dr.
: Howard is practising in New York, to which
city his very eloquent father has also just
had a call.
Strella Wilson, the star of the Gilbert and
Sullivan revival, was given the glad hand
by the Austral Salonites on a recent after-
noon : for Melbourne doesn’t forget that Strella
is the daughter of Harry Wilson, an Ameri-
can engineer, long settled in this city, where
his girl was educated. Ida Doubleday, wear-
ing fawn repp cloth with a blending of bois-
du-rose and a hat to match, played hostess,
with a helping hand from mother. Mrs. May
Qninnell, now once more installed as the
Salon’s hon. sec., congratulated the guest
upon her achievements. The singer, who
had been handed a posy of carnations, wore
a musquash-fur coat over a jumper suit of
tan hue, topped by a brown felt hat.
Dr. Barry Thomson and his wife are shin-
ing in reflected glory these days, since
Bananaland artist Shepherd’s portrait of
their actor-son Jack (John Barry) is
acclaimed the picture of the Royal Academy
spring show. Some idea of the sensation
the portrait lias made is given in a letter
from a Melbourne nurse now in London.
She writes that she stood in a queue for two
hours in order to see it, and was vastly
surprised when she recognised the sitter.
Helen Rennie and Kathleen Graham re-
cently assembled their friends to the number
of a couple of thousand to view the second
edition of their Mia Mia eatery, next door
to the Auditorium in Collins-street. Patrons
may now partake of light eatables in the sur-
roundings of a Dutch kitchen, or may fare
more elaborately upstairs in a very effective
interior of George-the-Fourthian age. Bui
to hark back to the kitchen. This was the
happy inspiration of artist Arthur Streeton’s
wife. It is very inviting with its stuccoed
walls and smoked beams and rafters. Light
from electric candles is reflected upon Span-
ish vessels of copper, brass and pewter on
the chimney-piece, and a kettle sits nice and
homey on the hearth. Fuchsias all a-blow-
ing in pots arc on the window ledges, and
there are marigolds in colored jars upon
tables that sport mats of kitchen towelling:
Gretchen, in bright blue frock and lace bon-
net, is there to wait upon one’s every wish.
Dancing is part of the destiny of the Geor-
gian room; and every Saturday morning
there is to be a special repast for children.
On Saturday night “The Best People” said
“Pleased ta meetya” to a crowded Athe-
naeum. "The Best People” are introduced in
a sitting-room that is a symphony of grey
and mauve with a discordant note of untidy
bookcases. Later most of the family (also
discordant) are found in mauve private
rooms in an unfashionable restaurant. Flor-
ence Roberts as Mrs. Lenox wears a tea-
gown y cream and pale gold brocade and
amber georgette for her first bout of hys-
terics over her wayward offspring and the
cook's departure, and later does some more
weeping in glad rags of wheat-hued radium
lace decorated with nigger-brown tassels.
Helen Audiffred, as daughter Marian, defies
mum and dad in several pretty garments, the
most attractive a cream silk frock sprinkled
with African daisies. From a box Dan
Carroll, with Dorothy Brunton and attendant
John Chirnside, smiled upon the reception
given brother E.J.’s latest Amurkan venture.
Sister Adelaide’s joys and sorrows: —
Saturday’s deluge thinned tlic feminine attendance
at the Cheltenham races and reduced the smart
frock ing to nil—dress was mostly an affair of snug
hats, heavy coats and well-clutched umbrellas. Lady
Bridges braved the weather in warm Egyptian red;
so did sonic of the Bowman and Crozier clans, Mrs.
W. B. Carr and Mrs. Lance Lewis. Other moistened
entertainments were the stone-laying at the Barker
Memorial Kindergarten in North Adelaide and May
Pay at the Children’s Hospital; the latter frivol
moved hastily from lawns and marquees to board-
room and balconies. The kindergarten is the gift
of Mrs. A. E. and Miss Barker —a memorial to the
late John Barker and his son that not only includes
the building but the whole of the furnishing and
a piano.
Arthur's Seat, once the home of the Gavin Youngs
and one of the oldest homes at Mount Lofty, is to be
a girls’ school in future, the purchaser and principal
being Patience Hawker, youngest of the Edward
Hawker daughters.
Mr. Schilsky, adjudicating in some musical jam-
boree in the West, claims to have discovered there
a pianist who will make the critics sit up. She
is Eileen Joyce, aged 17, and possessed of gifts
that “staggered” the adjudicator.
Mrs. C. IL. Angas, who died after a week’s illness
at her home in North Adelaide, will be much missed.
Her name is most closely associated with the
Children’s Hospital and Red Cross Society, but her
interests were wide and her gifts legion; few knew
their extent. Her only daughter, Mrs. R. D. Ryder,
on her way from England, heard of her mother s
death a few days before she reached the W est.
Lady Bridges was at the Unley Orchestra’s first
concert of the season —an excellent performance
at which the “Henry VIII.” suite of dances took
pride of place. The orchestra, which is now
three years old, is purely amateur, and has as its
conductor Norman Selliek.
Pink rose, pink carnations, pink-shaded lights and
floating streamers of soft pink satin ribbon were
the chief items of decorations at the MacFarlane
dance (the hostesses Mrs. Alan and Mrs. Gordon Mac-
Farlane) at the Osborne Hall; the pinkness was
diversified by the deep red of autumn-leaves and here
and there the gleam of a gilded basket. Mrs.
Alan MacFarlane was in black, with silver and
chenille and fur, and her sister-in-law in pink with
a hint of blue at the waist. Miss Betty MacFarlane
was all silver and white, with pink in her posy.
Lady Bridges was there, pink-clad too, with silvei
beads and panels of silver lace and a hint of fui
on her skirt. A younger matron trailed silver
apples over a background of black georgette, and
one of the youngest set—dark and handsome- was a
picture in vivid red georgette.

NOTIONS
Beauford, who is nine years old but hasn’t
been over-raced, made one of his periodical returns
to the business in the Prospect Handicap, six furlongs,
at Warwick Farm (N.S.W.) on Saturday. Now
trained at the Farm by I. H. Andrews, the veteran
was not fancied by the stable, which preferred “John
Baron’s” Bunting Wallace (3 to 1), but, galloping
freely for Pike, he made a gallant attempt to win.
His lOst. 31b. notwithstanding, he led for about
54 furlongs, and was then cut down by Valais Queen
(6 to 1), who was herself passed in the last 50 yards
by Duke Isinglass (20 to 1). That old stager, once
the pride of “Baron’s” stable—he is now owned and
trained by r S. R. Lamond —returned £l5 3s. on the
10s. tote. “Baron” and Andrews were amply com-
pensated in subsequent races, for Lady Ada (2 to 1),
who will do still better, won the first division of
the Intermediate Handicap, one mile; Alison (5 to
1) was third to Rice King (5 to 1) and Dijon (10
to 1) in the second division; and Sir Alick (5 to 1)
beat The Cause (5 to 2), Chryses (10 to 1) and 20
others in the Casula Handicap, seven furlongs. The
Cause comes from Queensland, and is useful, but he
was in an unfavorable position till he got clear in
the straight, and then found it too short for him.
Chryses also showed speed which suggests an early
success—perhaps at six furlongs. There were only
four starters in the May Handicap, 12 furlongs, and
the bookmakers demanded odds at first about Mick
Ryan’s Comedy King colt Sum King, who is being
prepared for the Queensland St. Leger. Sum King
is not bad, but he looked too burly for Saturday’s
job and ran accordingly; Rhymond (5 to 2), the best-
conditioned of the four, beat little Firefly, Sum King
and Pixie Lad handily. McShortodds had a profitable
day. thanks to Duke Isinglass and King Val (10
to 1), winner of the two-year-old race.
* ■* * #
The Night Patrol, who lias an unbeaten
record in Adelaide, earned a bit more stake-money
for Gerald Buckley in the Elder Stakes at Morphett-
ville, to which great improvements have been made
by the S.A. Jockey Club. Adrift, who had run a
close second to the English stallion on w.f.a. con-
ditions at Cheltenham, was favorite for the Good-
wood Handicap, but was never prominent. Bright
Poppy, last year’s winner, was the first to show out,
but J. H. Flannagan’s mare was soon headed by St.
Roseate (first in 1924 and second in 1925), who led
to the distance. There the old St. Anton —Ruse
Morn chestnut was tackled by imported Ben Lomond
(Lomond —Addenda), who beat him by half a length,
with Bright Poppy a close third. Owned by an
Adelaide man, Harry Lewis, but trained in Victoria
by Bird, Beii liomond, who was brought to Australia
by tlie old-time jockey Jimmy Hayes, was such an
outsider that he paid £49 12s. on the £1 tote, St.
Roseate’s div. being £3 is. Badger rode the
winner, who galloped the six furlongs in lmin. ISsec.
Greensborough, another from Victoria, added to Green-
stead’s reputation as a sire by winning the S.A.
Stakes, seven furlongs, from Pindenda (Pistol —-
Amalfi) and Borrodale (Rossendale —Tinkling) ; and
Belgarnba did what he was expected to do in the
St. Leger Stakes—his third this season. But the
Poitrel—Bunee Colt, having set a slow pace, was
hard put to it to shake off Aidriek, who had won
m open company the previous Saturday; “half a
head” was the judge’s verdict. Aidriek, who is
a ,”. a y gelding by Aides, an English horse who did
a bit of racing in Westralia, is owned by cattleman
Kidman and A. C. Edwards, and is distinctly
promising.
* * * i
Oriental Gem, who had run third to
Affirm and Batteryman in the Eight Hours Handicap
at Moonee Valley, was backed like a certainty for the
10-furlong event at Epsom (Vie.) on Saturday. How'-
ever, the 6-to-4 chance proved no match for Mountain
Prince (6 to 1), who took charge before they came into
the straight and won by half a length from Tookarby
(4 to 1), with the favorite a length away. The Prince
is a four-year-old gelding by Mountain King—-
Tontalda, and races in E. M. Pearce’s colors. He
hadn’t been seen in action for some time, and was
much fresher than Tookarby, who has surely earned
a spell. The Two-year-old Ha'ndicap, 43 furlongs,
was built to order for the slippery Greenie, and,
starting a 7-to-4 favorite, she led all the way, Hal-
yard (5 to 1) and unlucky Master Trillion (4 to 1)
chasing her home. The much-improved Spear Maiden,
by Spearhead—Snow Song (3 to 1), made an
exhibition of her field in the Epsom Plate, six
furlongs, winning by seven lengths from Estuary (6
to 1), with Ellaline (8 to 1) four lengths away.
W. Leyshon owns and trains the winner, and he was
also successful in the last race with Flying Start
(6 to 21, the last offspring of old Wakeful, Rose-
worthy being the sire.

“Ascot”: Theodore is one of the few
Queensland Labor leaders who don’t go racing, so
when he throws out a tip it is heeded. Speaking
the night before the May Day races at Ascot, he
made repeated references to “centrifugal force, which
cannot be resisted.” In the result there was a
great run on Centrifugal in the first race next day,
and Centrifugal was very unlucky to lose. At her
second attempt, on Labor Day, the Seremond filly
won in a canter. She started a red-hot favorite
at evens, and would have been at odds on if punters
could have pronounced the name.
* * * *
“Centurion”: A recent decision of the
English High Court has some interest for s.p.
punters, especially those who backed Murray King
in the Sydney Cup, and had to take whatever odds
the concealed s.p. shark liked to give them, in
place of the 200 to 1 quoted. The plaintiff put
£lO on a horse at 100 to 1, and defendant would
pay no more than 33 to 1, which he said was his
limit. Plaintiff appealed to Tattersall’s committee,
which decided in his favor, but the odds-layer still
refused to pay. The Judge found for defendant, not
on the merits of the case, but because there was
no evidence that Tattersall’s rules are enforceable.
It would be interesting if someone tested the question
of, say, the A.J.C.’s authority to lay down rules for
the conduct of betting in N.S.W. It is by no
means as firmly founded as many people imagine.
* * * *
“Killara”: Fred Popplewell’s performance
of 76 in the qualify-
ing round of the
Daily Mail’s £l2OO
competition pleased
Australian golfers and
British critics alike.
With a little better
putting he would have
returned the best card
of the day. His long
shots with both wood
and iron were so good
that the crowd cheered.
Howard’s 78 was dis-
tinctly creditable, con-
sidering that he was
battling with influenza.
And if Sinclair’s open-
ing rounds at Muirfield
are equal to his 79 at
North Berwick bi g
things may be ex-
pected of that young
man in the amateur
classic.
PAT O'HARA
WOOD, Vic.
tennis crack, and
one of the greatest
doubles players
in the world.
Australian teams in England open their
season nowadays under easier conditions than in the
’nineties and later, when they were often called upon
to face a strong team —sometimes it was Lord Shef-
field’s, with the redoubtable “W.G.” at the head -
at the outset. Incidentally, the visitors had perhaps
more sides of comparatively strong calibre to face
when there w T ere only eight or nine first-class
counties, each of them to be played twice, than now
that there are 17, of which only three —Surrey, York-
shire and Lancashire —can be given a return game.
In the dismal climatic conditions prevailing this May
Collins and eo. were doubtless glad enough to begin
on Leicestershire and Essex, the former with hardly
a batsman of high quality and the latter markedly
weak in the bowling department. In matches limited
to two days in each case by rain they got some
needed practice and put up some notable individual
performances. Eclipsing Gregory’s 120 n.o. and
Ponsford’s 56 in the one innings of 336 at Leicester
came Macartney’s phenomenally successful bowling—
-5 wickets for 9 runs in a total of 96. Against
Essex the eleven stayed at the wickets for most of the
playing time, and declared with 9 for 535. There
were some failures, but with Woodfull’s 201, Macart-
ney’s 148 and Hendry’s 71 there Will be no weaken-
ing of confidence in the team’s run-getting capacity
against the great majority of sides. The fact that
the first plaver to make a double century was the
last man picked, for his batting only, by the Aus-
tralian selectors may be regarded either as evidence
that here is a team of super-batsmen, or that the
selectors narrowly missed making a worse mistake
than any they have been charged with. The county
had lost 2 wickets for 6 when the match was
abandoned.
Surrey, which is always near the top of the tree,
though it has been unable to challenge Yorkshire’s
supremacy for the last five years, looked a much
tougher proposition. Collins, who has yet to lose
the toss, elected to bat, and, after the captain
himself had gone cheaply on a treacherous wicket,
Bardsley (34) and Macartney (53) came to the
rescue. Then Taylor (76), getting going for the
first time and helped by a missed chance or two,
entered into a prolific partnership with Woodful]
which realised 139 for the fourth wicket. Wood-
full’s continued success confirms the shrewd judg-
ment of Sutcliffe, after the last English tour, that
the young Victorian would do big things on English
wickets should he get the chance. On Monday,
when play was again delayed and interfered with
by rain, he put a second three-figure score (118)
to his credit, thereby presenting a new record
to the enthusiasts who delight in such things.
Hendry co-operated with a useful 68, and, with 9
wickets down for 395, Collins declared at tea-time.
Lockton took 4 wickets, and Peach and Fender 2
apiece. Surrey lacks a bowler of real class, although
the resourceful captain is always liable to be
dangerous, and its fielding seems to have been
below standard, though Bardsley paid the penalty
that every batsman courts who takes any sort of a
chance with Hobbs at cover-point. The Australians
knocked off on Monday in an unassailable position,
their opponents having lost one wicket for 64;
Hobbs got his leg in front of one from Macartney
with a mere 22 to his name.

After much knocking at the door, Queens-
land is to be admitted to the sacred circle of comneti-
tors for the Sheffield Shield. This was among the deci-
sions reached by delegates to the inter-State cricket
conference at Adelaide. The newcomer is to plav
only one match a season with South Oss, the fixture
being held alternately in Brisbane and Adelaide An-
other conference decision is that games are to com-
“s* 0 a.m. Seeing that the 22 persons
engaged do nothing but play cricket on a match day,
there was never any reason why they should waste
the whole morning, but the change will still admit
of matches stretching into the second week, as they

Beauford was not the only former flier
who found the youngsters too fast for him on
Saturday. Tommy Uren, scaling list., had the
same experience when he took on'the English negro
hen Johnson (list. 21b.) at Sydney Stadium. There
v k a f, A, splendid attendance, the gate amounting to
*.lOBO, of which the management took 50 p.c. and
the pugs 25 p.c. each. Johnson was favorite at
2 to 1 on, but for thq first three rounds Uren made
* 1)m „ cheap, the colored man seeming unable
to find a stop other than his nose and mouth, for
tommy s shooting left. In the fourth, however the
ex-champion was just as incapable of avoiding
the concussion of three rights to head and ear.
Uren s jabbing left was active in the next four
rounds; but all the while Johnson was weakening the
veteran by well-timed rights ip the ribs, and he got
into the way of shifting his head, letting Tom’s
lead slide past his ear, and burying his own right
in the bread-basket. Also, he frequently employed
the illegal “rabbiter.” Thomas began to sling over-
arm rights in the hope of fluking the chin, a sure
sign of failing resource and self-reliance. Heavy
left rips to the body and two “rabbiters” weakened
him in the tenth round; and in the first minute of
the 11th, as Tommy stepped in to deliver a left at
the face Johnson slipped it and drove his right to
the mark with tremendous force. Uren reeled back
and fell, grasping convulsively at his middle. It
was the first clean knockout by the solar-plexus
blow seen m a Sydney ring for many a day.
* * * '*
Bert McCarthy’s third attempt at Billy
Grime’s lightweight title drew a large crowd to the
Melbourne Stadium. The champion, who takote
things easily at times, was in one of hia dangerous
moods, and the pace was a cracker from the start,
'he crowd’s sympathy was with McCarthy, who did
well with a left hook to the body, and also exploited
the straight left with some success; but Grime’s
punches were much more powerful. He shook the
challenger with every blow. The eighth round saw
the finish. Each landed simultaneously with rights.
Grime’s was the heavier, and, jumping in quickly,
he dropped his opponent for nine. On regaining his
feet Bert was merely a target for the knockout, and
william whipped it over. Grime is the nearest
approach to a world’s champion that Australia has
seen since Darcy died, and it would pay Stadiums,
l.td., to give him a cut at the best Yank at the
■weight, whoever that may be. Billy, who can go to
scale at Bst, 131 b., built up to 9st. 31b. for McCarthy,
who was 6lb. heavier.

The eight-oar championship of Australia
was rowed on the Brisbane River on Saturday and
won by Tasmania, with South Australia, Victoria and
Queensland following in that order. The Westralians,
who triumphed on the Yarra last year, did not
compete on this occasion, being unable to raise the
£lOOO which it would have cost to send the crew,
and N. S. Wales was not placed, having dropped so
far behind that the crew was washed out by hurrying
steamers whose passengers were anxious to see the
finish. The light Queensland crew led for part of the
journey, but the weighty Tasmanians were in front
at the mile point and were not again headed. Tas-
mania, whose fourth success it was in the 34 races
rowed to date, won by a length from the South
Australians, who finished gamely, the time being
15min. 43see. Vic., with 26 races, has the best
record, but has not won for 14 years. Tassy was
coached by the veteran McVilly. The amateur scull-
ing championship was regained by Arthur Baynes, of
Queensland, who beat J. A. Goulding (N.S.W.) and
A. Cambridge (Vic.) by a length and a half and
two lengths respectively; time, 15min. 35see. Gould-
ing, the 19-year-old 10-stoner from Sydney, sculled
a very fine race, and will be champion some day if
he doesn’t get too fond of jazz, cigarettes and
motoring.
* * * *
A cruel tragedy preceded the liead-of-the-
river race on the Yarra. Lieut.-Colonel Tulloch, the
coach of the Melbourne Grammar crew, was shot dead
in an apartment house at an early hour on Saturday.
Tulloch had seen his crew win its heat on Friday,
and had gone to bed early and in optimistic mood to
be in good form for the morrow’s battle. He appa-
rently surprised and grappled with a burglar, who
fired two shots into him and then escaped. Tulloch
was a first-rate sportsman and good fellow who
since 1908 had taken a leading part in inter-State
rowing, and at Gallipoli earned the distinction of
leading a party of the 11th (Westralian) Battalion
to the furthest point gained at the Landing. He
trained the Diggers who pulled off the King’s Cup
at Henley in 1919 and brought the bauble to Aus-
tralia.
The race was one that would have gladdened
poor Tulloch’s heart. A mighty roar went up
from the assembled 60,000 -when Scotch, Geelong
and Melbourne rounded the bend and entered the
booms without a canvas between them. It was
the closest contest for years, and if somebody
had transported the finishing flag another 50 yards
west, the three extra strokes to the minute
that Geelong whipped in at the last might have
given it the victory. The seaside eight surprised
the experts by pushing its nose forward from the
initial dip, but there was bad steering at the bend, out
of which Scotch, rowing a rate midway between its
rivals, but digging strongly, emerged a half-length
in the lead. Scotch, Geelong and Melbourne was the
order at the finish, which was dose enough to leave
all but those in the direct line of vision bawling
their fancy’s name until the right information spread.
The time was smin. llsec. over the measured mile.
These college races are better managed in Melbourne
than in Sydney. On the Yarra the callous idiot in
the speed-boat who provides the crews with the
semblance of a Leeuwin sea to fight against is con-
spicuous by his stillness.
“C. Bumpkin”: “Grandstands for a bob” were
more plentiful than ever on Yarra’s banks at the
boatrace. Lorries loaded with fruit-cases and kerosene-
tins discharged their cargo and went off for more
as if some major war operation were in progress.
In the end everybody had a perch or a share in one,
and nobody was better off than his neighbor. Then
an enterprising vendor started the cry “Another
grandstand for a sprat.” The crowd was in process
of being lifted bodily another 12in. when the starting
pistol stopped the lucrative business.
.** * *
G. B. Shailer, the N.S.W. policeman who
was sent to Britain by enthusiasts to bring the
amateur billiards championship to Australia, all but
justified the confidence placed in him. After easily
overcoming his other three opponents, he lost his
fine form in the early part of his encounter with
Earlam, who has few superiors among the British
pros., and recovered) it too late, Earlam running out
with a fine 189 break—2ooo to 1394. In the first
session Shailer scored only 69 to Earlam’s 501; in
the next the Englishman got his quota while the
Aussie made 345 ; so the invader’s task was then
hopeless. In the final lap he scored better than his
opponent, and though he failed to bring back the
trophy, he has surely earned the right to another
try when it is put up again.
* * * *
Sydney’s football following was well dis-
tributed among the four codes on Saturday, the
principal attraction being the League match between
North and South Sydney at the Cricket Ground.
When the ’Shoremen hoisted seven points to nil in
short order the supporters of the premiers were
stricken dumb. Before half-time, however, the fine
South Sydney back division found its feet, and there-
after the side swept on to win a fast and brilliant
game by 27 points to 13 —7 tries and 3 goals to
3 tries, 2 goals. Harris, the new South Sydney
centre, is a rare find; he practically presented the
flying Wearing with his four tries. Eastern Sub-
urbs won another bright game from St. George,
22 to 18; Prank Burge’s reappearance with Glebe
helped the Reds to beat Balmain, 5 to 3; and
University found Western Suburbs fairly easy, 14 to
8. Glebe-Balmain, the Rugby Union premiers, com-
fortably accounted for Y.M.C.A., scoring 6 tries
and a goal to a try and ,2 penalty goals. Randwiek’s
32 to 22 victory over Manly gave the crack winger,
Crossman, a chance for firework effects; he got 20
of his side’s points, making 35 in the first two
matches this season. Soccer followers were provided
with a shock when Granville, the hitherto unbeaten
premiers, went down by 3 goals to 2 to Woonoona, one
of the South Coast clubs, on the latter’s ground.
Another South Coast side, Balgownie, walloped
Gladesville-Ryde by 4 goals to 1, thanks chiefly to
the artistry of “Judy” Masters, the Australian cap-
tain of last year, at centre-forward. The three
Australian Rules games were witnessed by surpris-
ingly good crowds, especially at Chatswood, where
Newtown and North Shore drew 4000 to see the
first Aussie game ever played on the oval. Newtown
triumphed by 70 to 66. The star game between
Western Suburbs and South Sydney at Erskineville
resulted in West kicking 76 to 69 —10 goals 16
behinds to 10 goals 9 behinds.
* * * •
There wasn’t quite a boat-race crowd at
any of the League games in Victoria on Saturday, but
some 28,000 braved the threatening weather at
Victoria Park. There the Collingwood Magpies, at
home to Essendon, failed to reproduce their form
against Fitzroy, and, unsystematic and fumbling, lost
with 47 points to ’Don’s 78. The collision between
Fitzroy and Richmond promised excitement which
didn’t materialise, the Tigers playing all over the
Maroons and winding up with 116 points to ’Roy’s
58. St. Kilda, battling hard against last season’s
premiers, Geelong, owned a 7-point lead at lemon-
time; but strenuous Geelong dashes in the last few
minutes saved the situation for the men from
Sleepy Hollow: Geelong, no ; St. Kilda, 105. A
worse fate overtook the burly Melbourne men, up
against their ancient Carlton opponents. At lemon-
time they boasted a 24-point lead; but the Old
Blues, helped by the resuscitated Horrie Clover, took
control of the game, piled on another 37 points, arid
got the verdict with 69 points to Melbourne’s 6S.
South Melbourne downed Footscray by 90 points to
57 ; and Hawthorn, coached by Dannv Minogue, col-
lected 42 points to North Melbourne’s 38.

OTlalloniri, K.C., the new chairman of
S.A. Football League, has started to enforce the
severe sentences he promised to anybody not keeping
the Australian code clean. The first sufferer is a
prominent member of the Sturt club. For kicking
at an opponent he was suspended for five matches,
the judge ruling that
the offence was com-
plete even though the
kick did not connect.
Another holiday for
three matches was
added for hitting a
man on the nose with
an elbow, this being
pronounced “unwar-
ranted, unfair, and
deliberate.' 1

“FY7”: That reference to an abo. cricket

the N.T. Australian-rules championship, and they
are said to be fine kicks, in spite of the fact that
they play without boots. Which further recalls the

CANADA—that wonderland
with
teeming
v romance and adventure—opens unknown
beauties to those who would escape from the
hustle and bustle of life in a crowded city.
The glories, splendour and majesty of the Canadian
Rockies form an effective background for the shining
lakes and other beauty spots that lie at their feet —and
far away from all the worries and cares you can rest for
awhile in a cosy, jolly bungalow camp—or in a luxuri-
ous hotel.
The Canadian Pacific Railway
system of transportation is the most up-to-date and modern
railway system in the world. The equipment is designed for
the greatest comfort, while the service of all employees is
unequalled.
Plan ahead—book your accommodation for trains, hotels and steam-
ships prior to your departure. Through tickets to England and the-
Continent of Europe are obtainable in connection with' the Canadian-
Australasian Royal Mail Line to Vancouver, and the Canadian Paci ic
Steamship services across the Atlantic. The New Quadruple-sere #
Motor Ship "Aorangi’ (23,000 tons displacement) in connection wCh
the favorite s.s. “Niagara” afford an unrivalled service to and from
Vancouver, B.C.

THE INKY WAY.
“T.P.W.”: .Tim Walsh, who sailed with
his bride early last year for London, has
scored what must be abont a record for an
Australian author. In the 11 months he
has placed six novels with London publishers,
and the third edition of one (“The White
Mask") is already advertised. Walsh has
now 14 books to his credit in Australia and
England, and has produced no less than 37
serials besides innumerable short stories.
“Hasen”: Ilecent advices have it that
Zane Grey is not to visit Australia, after all—
not on this trip, anyhow; lie is returning
direct from M.L. to America. Apparently
the lure of fishing in the Dominion diverted
him from his well-advertised purpose of per-
petrating an “Australian” novel. Still, such
a hope may be premature; for if phlegmatic
and undistinguished dollar-makers on a
tourist-ship can learn all about us by means
of a 24-48 hours’ stay at a couple of ports,
a distinguished and impressionable author
may have been able to absorb sufficient
“atmosphere” from the other side of the
Tasman.
A recent funeral on the Inky Way was
that of Fairplay, which has had a chequered
career since it was started by John D. Fitz-
gerald. His ideas were ambitious, and the
paper promised to be a happy hunting-
ground for the freelance writer; but in three
months it was on the financial rocks, and the
Liquor Trades people, for whom it had been
a more or less official advocate, took it over.
They ran it for years, but ultimately sold it
to the New Century Press, which turned it
into a purely sporting paper. Ever since
the A.J.A. got an award substantially in-
creasing the staff salaries, the New Century
Press has been trying to get rid of the ven-
ture, and finally it was allowed to die.
The death of Rabbi Chodowski recalls one
of the quaintest stories in journalistic his-
tory. Loosan was a scholarly man who, on
the death of the girl he was to marry, de-
cided to drink himself to death. He threw
up an influential position in Scotland, where,
incidentally, he was superintendent of a
Presbyterian Sunday-school, and came to
Australia for his liquid end. He held many
good press jobs, including the editorship of
a Brisbane paper, but lost them all. Chodow-
ski, who had known him in Brisbane, wired
him his fare to M.L., and induced an R.C.
friend there to give him a job on an R.C.
organ. Such a job given to a Presbyterian
by an R.C. priest at the instance of a Jewish
minister is surely unique.
"124”: Daily papers in Bundaberg (Q.)
are establishing a lien on Melbourne Herald.
At the end of last year its amalgam of two
old sheets, the Daily News and Mail,
took for editor Llewellyn (“Copabella”)
Griffiths, who for the Herald proprietary
had seen Punch through to its expensive
funeral. Now a new venture, the Bunda-
berg Times, has chosen as its first editor and
manager George Groom, a sub. on the Mel-
bourne evening daily and one of Keith Mur-
doch's bright young men. George, who re-
turns to his home State, is a son of W.H,
of the family that formerly controlled and
ran the Toowoomba Chronicle, and a
nephew of Littleton, M.H.R. Pie wrote his
first reports for the Chronicle.
James Arthur Barrett Fry, who died at
Killara (Sydney) a few days ago, aged 76,
was an indefatigable penman, who, not con-
tent with long holding the job of chief cor-
respondence clerk in the N.S.W. Mines De-
partment, filled reams of paper for the
Public Service Journal. But the thing
the versatile old gentleman was proudest of
was that he had been the first shorthand-
writer appointed to the N.S.W. Government
service. He wrote most of the “society”
verse in the earliest numbers of The Bulle-
tin, and continued a prolific contributor
until the reign of Traill. He had differences
with that fierce Hebridean which were never
quite composed. His death followed within
a week of the unveiling of a church window
to the memory of his two sons killed in the
war.
“Fitz”: Jack Fitzpatrick, M.L.A., who has
just arrived in London, started his career on
the Inky Way at Windsor (N.S.W.), serving
his time as a comp, with the late George
Lewis Asher Davies, who was running the
Australian. But young Jack couldn’t stick
it, wandered off, got a “case” in the Govern-
ment Printing Office (Sydney), had shots at
journalism in Parramatta, Goulburn, Gunne-
dah, Melbourne and a few other places, anil
then drifted back to Windsor with a long
beard and a short purse to start the Wind-
sor and Richmond Gazette in competi-
tion with his old boss Davies. The pair
fought like Kilkenny cats, until old-man
Davies left for Kogarah. Both the Gazette
and the Australian in those days were
printed on hand presses, and Fitz used to
work like a horse and prepare and deliver
political speeches in, between times. He
once stood for Parliament for the Hawkes-
bury—-Sydney Burdekin and Morgan were
his opponents. Burdekin waltzed in; Fitz
lost his £4O.
Arthur Wilberforcc Jose —the second name
proclaims a family connection with the great
slave emancipator—has gone tripping to Eng-
land. which he left in 1882 as a lad of 19.
Most of the intervening years have been
spent in Australia, although he was an
acting-professor of English and History in
India for a while. In. Australia he has occu-
pied similar professorial posts, but his real
work has been in writing text-books of Aus-
tralian history, and compiling such works
as “The Growth of the Empire” and “The
Australian Encyclopa'dia”; during inter-
vals he has been Australian correspondent of
the London Times, and has covered acres
of space in other papers. During the war
he enlisted, but it was decided that best use
could be made of him in the naval intelli-
gence branch of the R.A.N. In that brief
period of exaltation, when Hughes proceeded
to impose a political and personal censor-
ship on Australian papers, Jose was put in
charge of that department. It will always
stand to the credit of Holman that he led
the forces which promptly smashed that
piece of midsummer madness.

A distinctly plumper voice emerged from a
decidedly plumper torso when Toti dal
Monte sprinted on to the boards at Mel-
bourne Auditorium on Saturday and smilingly
informed the crowded hall, in the cavatina
“Una voce poco fa” from “The Barber of
Seville,” that she was being savaged by the
direst demons of emotion. This Showman
refused flatly to believe it, although the
statement was couched in telling phrases and
the high notes of the lady were rounder and
more assured than ever. The intensity of the
merry litle donna’s passion is belied by her
infantile mask. When she tears a passion to
tatters the effect is of a bright, intelligent
child disembowelling a rag doll to see what
is inside. Nevertheless, the audience was
prepared to accept Toti’s spiritual condition
as really serious, and tried to console her
with repeated encores and baskets crammed
with autumnal garden stuff. Later she
dried her tears and essayed some Italian
airs in which her tender breath shook out
soft piano notes as easily as the tropical mon-
soon shakes melody out of a Malay along
along. The occasional emergence of wo:ds
like “babies” and “teardrops” apprised her
hearers that she was airing her proficiency in
English ; but she does not take her new
accomplishment very seriously and laughed
as heartily as any. Some dainty Spanish
ditties followed, in which a distressing ban-
ality of wording didn’t matter. Lastly
she summoned her baritone support,
and together they assaulted the duet of
Norina and Malatesta in “Don Pasquale.”
with enchanting vivacity on her part and
amazing verbal facility on his. No
music palpitates like the Italian, and
nobody can make it palpitate like the
fellow-countrymen of Mussolini. Augusto
Beuf, the baritone aforesaid, raises its fre-
quency sometimes to an almost excessive
figure. The burly, black-shingled nightingale
has a voice of considerable range and a
soundbox of power, as well as humor and a
dramatic sense. The pale, ascetic face of
William James, the young Australian, rose
over the piano keys, and his astute
interpretation of the confused rhetoric of
Debussy in the Prelude in A Minor, his
musings in a piece by Alkan and his rush
and scamper through Liszt’s Rakoczy March
were additional laurels on the evening’s fore-
head.
* : * * •
On Tuesday Toti was heard in excerpts
from “Rigoletto” and “Mignon,” and with
her partner fought her way triumphantly
through “Dunque io son” from “The Barber
of Seville. More new dishes will be served
to-night and again on Saturday and Tuesday.
* * * *
“The Best People,” who started to con-
verse at Melbourne Athenaeum on Saturday,
would once upon a time have labored under
a disadvantage. Twelve years ago, when
“Within the Law” was staged in Australia
for the first time, it was considered neces-
sary to supply a glossary of American words
and phrases. The cinema has done its noble
work of education since, and it is safe, to
say that not a Bow-ery ton mot was mis-
understood by the delighted Australian crowd
which demanded speeches after the show
from nearly all the gladiators. The comedy
is not without rude merit. Avery Hopwood
makes his points with all the subtlety of an
enraged army mule hoofing down its shelter.
Long moral dissertations in dialects, sub-
dialects and patois ranging from Southern
Californian to Bostonian are saved from
becoming tedious by the frequent exchange
at arms-length of verbal custard-pies hurled
with the deadliest precision. The playwright
has an almost inexhaustible collection of
movie sub-titles in his card-indexes. Apart
from this original method of conducting the
action of a plqy the piece is as orthodox in
conception as a Governor-General’s farewell
to a roomful of Rotarians. An aristocratic
N York couple—the republican parades his
ancient lineage somewhat rawly—have
brought into the world two extremely inde-
pendent and unusually outspoken children.
The girl clandestinely engages herself to the
family chauffeur; the boy adheres to a
chorus-girl. After explaining this to the
audience the chief characters adjourn from
the drawing-room in East Sixty-fifth-street
to private dining-rooms in a restaurant in
order to allow everybody to surprise every-
body else in compromising circumstances.
The necessary disclosures having been made,
the action rolls up its tents and returns to
East Sixty-fifth-street, and after a spirited,
if lengthy, debate the parents come to the
impossible decision to give their blessing.
* * * *
Robert Adams, dowered by nature with a
voice that would fit him without further
training for the ghost of Hamlet’s father,
was supposed to be an unpalatable motor-
driver for a delicately nurtured girl like
Helen Audiffred to fall in love with. But the
nurture had to be taken very much for
granted, so that the probabilities were not
desperately outraged. Richard Ehlers, a
matinee idol if ever there was one, was the
blue-ribbon rum-hound son of the family, who
decides to marry Marian Sterly, a pathetic
little bit of prettiness as the chorus-girl.
Harold Salter revealed genuine histrionic
talent as the nobly tolerant father, and
Florence Roberts was effective as his bitter
half. Marion Lord, a professional vamp
to whom no man is a stranger who will buy
her food, scored a running fire" of bull’s-eyes
with some natural acting and some fiery
aphorisms. William Macauley was a wowser
uncle. J. B. Rowe was the only represen-
tative of the English race. As Lord Rock-
mere he is a poor sap who runs in terror
from drunken Americans, and is the only
thoroughly contemptible character in the
play. Racial prejudice as reflected on the
stage is an interesting study. The Devil in
Mexican drama is usually dressed in the
uniform of an American army officer, and in
Javanese dramaturgy the villain is always a
half-caste Dutchman.
** * *
The Theatre Association presented Noel
Coward to a Melbourne audience for the
first time last week at; the Palace Theatre
in “The Young Idea,’’ which concerns the
successful endeavors of two children to in-
duce their father to leave his second wife
and return to his first. The latest “greatest
modern playwright” reveals himself herein
as nothing new and strange, but rather a
facile craftsman of the old school, content
to use such shopsoiled stage-tricks as sing-
ing “off” and spies hiding behind the arras.
Nevertheless, he has not subscribed to the
go-slow doctrine, as some other modern
dramaturgists have: the rising of the cur-
tain finds him with his sleeves rolled up, and
at its final descent he is in the same work-
manlike garb. The cast was a mixture of
professionals and amateurs. Harry Fenwick
was a butler kindly lent out of stock by the
management of “The Nervous Wreck,” and
Oliver Bainbridge w r as a lover supplied by
“The Sport of Kings.” Marjorie Jones
and Terence Crisp were amateurs who, by
breaking the canons of all the ages, gave one
of the most convincing expositions of the
comic spirit this critic has seen for many
moons. Incidentally, such Noel Coward
profundities as “she has no morals, and far
more children than is usual for a single
woman” were scarcely appropriate to a bene-
fit performance in aid of a foundling hospital.
** * *
A melodrama by G. B. Shaw, like a rice-
pudding by a famous chef, is sure to be
something different. Shaw’s melodrama,
“The Devil’s Disciple,” is a willing and
thrilling as well as witty satire on the
American War of Independence, and as
presented by the Melbourne Repertorians at
the Playhouse this week makes an accept-

able entertainment for brows, high, low and
mezzo. Walter Armstrong was a debonair
ruffian as Richard Dudgeon, and Betty Rae,
a lady born to tragic roles, died satisfactorily
as his mother in the first act. Charles Row
was a very excellent Parson Anderson, and
Isabel Handley was very charmingly his
wife. Claud Thomas, as the ill-fated General
Bourgoyne, and Roy Johnson, as the incom-
petent Major Swindon, bowed and scraped to
each other in a manner that this Page is
prepared to take as de rigueur in the British
colonial army in 1777. The rest of Miss
Handley’s crew pulled their weight. The
show will see the present week out.

The old crew is carrying on at Melbourne
Tivoli with some help from new acquisitions.
The woodclioppers continue to excite interest
from country visitors and hopeless envy in
suburbanites, and Gautier’s dog act inspires
moderate enthusiasm. Valentine and Bell
have finished destroying furniture; in their
place Betty Blackburn is singing in the
dialect of Lancashire, and Mills and Innes
are literally, as well as metaphorically, tons
of fun.

The Melbourne Bijou was reinforced on
Saturday by Moon and Morris and their
revue company of six rather sparkling gals.
But the sketches provided by the newcomers
are not burningly bright. A low-comedy

present garrison.

Clive Brook, an English actor, is providing
some lucid intervals which command respect
at Melbourne Majestic this week. The
drama, which contains several verses of
celluloid that are well above the average, is
called “The Woman Hater.” “Wildfire,” a
racing story, is a horse of another color but
of a quite familiar brand. Rudolph is being
Valentino in a picturesque romance called
“The Eagle” at Hoyt’s, and “Seven Keys to
Baldpate” at the same dumb showhouse is
justifying encomiums bestowed on it else-
where.
* * * *
Some bookplates:—
A show of ex-libris by Australian and Continental
artists at Queen’s Hall, Melbourne, gives an oppor-
tunity for comparisons. Practitioners in this country
have not taken this craft very seriously. Lionel
Lindsay's woodcuts are bold and appropriate, but
the efforts of D. H. Souter, Hilder, Shirlow, Sid
Smith and others are mere asides, like the sketch
one dashes off in an album because its owner is
such a sweet young thing, and a few early examples
by Norman Lindsay only serve to illustrate the
fact that artists get born but have to make them-
selves. The Continentals, however, mainly Austrians
and Germans, take the thing with tremendous sighs
and knittings of the brow. All schools are repre-
sented, including the dadaist. No. 19, an exquisitely
etched landscape, is fit to hang on any wall. The
Australian Ex-Libris Society, with John Lane Mul-
lins, M.L.0., as president and with vice-presidents
in every State, is now available and should promote
interest in the cult.

Pavlova still holds the stage at Sydney
Majesty’s. This week she serves Dionysius,
nrst as a priestess (in a rhythm of Greek
posing) and later, when the other priestesses
are abed, as his dancing partner in a whirl-
wind of mad perfection. For purposes of
these revets the god waves his hand and his
rocky grotto is turned into a sylvan mead —
a striking effect of stage mechanics. Pav-
lova as a chrysanthemum in the Autumn
Leaves ballet, and Pavalova again as
Romance disguised as a Pierrette, fills the
senses with beauty; while Novikoff and Hit-
cbin, as the Poet and the North Wind in the
second ballet, earn nightly their cannonade
of applause.

“Lilac Time” in Sydney is short: the
tuneful opera stays at the Royal until, on
the 22nd, it is moved to Her Majesty’s for
a final week’s blossoming. “Rose-Marie,”
long promised, will then arrive.

Something different from the place Moham-

The double bill of the Sydney Repertory
Society is raising the loud laugh at the Con-
servatorium this week. The first, Anatole
France’s “Man Who Married a Dumb Wife,”
earns it. The story, briefly, is that Leonard
Botal, a judge, has married a wife who,
though possessing property and good looks,
has not the power of speech. Botal grieves
over this, not only because his lady makes
a somewhat inadequate companion, but be-
cause she cannot be much help in wheedling
gifts from those who would gain a favorable
judgment from him. Finally, with the aid of
a famous surgeon, the lady’s tongue is loosed.
The curtain drops on the husband undergoing
an operation to procure deafness. In this
absurdity Lily Titheradge (Mrs. Herrick
Knowles) as Catherine Botal, the wife, urns
a joy. Her complacent self-approval, the
tweak of her skirts, the toss of the absurd
head-dress were inimitable. Albert Collins
was the much-tried husband, and was a
chuckle. Bernard Shaw’s “Androcles and
the Lion” fared a good <Jeal worse at the
hands of its interpreters. It might be harsh
to say they slaughtered it, but at least they
acted as very strong brakes on its prancings.
Joe Morris’s Lion and G. R. Irving’s Em-
peror were the only two whom the play-
wright might have recognised as children of
his fancy.
** * *
Two minor shows in Sydney:—
John C. Goodehild, who went to the war as a
youth and came back an artist (he got his first
commissions after the war —they were to make sketches
of A.I.F. cemeteries) gives an exhibition of work
at the Grosvenor Galleries. It is all good and attrac-
tive, with flashes of great promise, especially in the
etchings, which make nearly half of the exhibits.
‘‘The G.P.0., Adelaide,” of which the Sydney Gallery
is a purchaser, frames the subject ii\ the opening of
a darkened arch through which the artist has seen
it—a well-conceived effect. No. 47, Westminster
Abbey vista, is also intriguingly done, and “Sun-
down” (No. 53) and “Sydney from Bradley’s Head”
are broadly effective. In a conte crayon, “Sunset
Glow” is well expressed; and in general the exhibits
are honestly produced, the line is firm and good,
and the subjects usually have an interest. One oil
is shown—apparently to indicate that oils are not
the artist’s medium.
Gordon Craig, an English black-and-white artist,
has a light show of usually well-designed woodcuts
at the Macquarie Galleries, but in the main they are
merely illustrative and will chiefly appeal to those
who desire to pick up a few trifles for home
decoration.

LIFE is a game which must be played according to

activities, but free of worry —and

The Major.'
CAVAN DERS LTp
LONDON.
The union of Mo (Roy Rene) with Fred
Bluett in a Sydney Tivoli turn was, of
course, inspired by a desire to suit the
public that: was “tickled to death” by Stiffy
and Mo; but the experiment, launched on
Monday night, is largely a failure. Bluett,
who can always get laughs on his own
account, is not used to being a foil, and in
a turn full of raw edges both suffered by
the combination. Van Dock is a cartoonist
whose methods are as near to being instanta-
neous as it is possible to imagine; and
V alentme and Bell, also newcomers, econo-
mise time by blending acrobatics with
cycling tricks, one of the thjrills being the
lady s leap on to the of her male
partner whilst he is balanced, on the tall seat
of a umcycle. This is a cut above most
cycle acts, and deserves more applause than
it lias got a rare thing with a vaudeville
turn.
H*
The last lady this Showman met in a
turn resembling the omv presented at Fullers’
(Sydney) by Mademoiselle Leah was
merely sawn in halves in a box—a quite
simple job when it is done by an expert.
Lhe box in which thin new lady is deposited
is vigorously thrust tjhrougli with swords and
daggers until it resembles a pin-cushion;
then, out of a small slide in the- side, her
partner draws the dress she was wearing
when last seen. The appearance of thid
garment increases popular anticipation when
the partner, one M. Sigrak, withdraws the
cutlery, cuts the ropes and reopens the box.
lhen, of course, Leah reappears—wearing an-
other dress! The act is a well-worked trick.
The other turns, which include still the danc-
ing Billy Heaton and lima Strange, are good
vaudeville. Jim Gerald s half of the show
this week is “Step This Way,” and Gerald
is amusing in it.
* ❖ *
Those who go to the Hippodrome when
Satuiday night is past won t find a circus
there Wirths’ are about to set out on their
travels once more, and it will be next year
before the circus comes to Sydney again.
** * *
In a story which is a cross between “Give
and Take” and “Vice Versa,” Hoyt’s Svdney
house presents “New Brooms” this week-
a middle-aged broom-manufacturer, taunted
by las son with out-of-date methods, throws
the responsibility of the business on the
young man for a year; and while the young
man suffers the old boy really enjoys himself.
Die Dixie Merchant” is the companion film.
The Eleventh Commandment,” which is the
ancient one about not being found out, shows
at the Lyceum—a threadbare story relieved
by very good presentation and acting, much
ot the latter being provided by Fay Compton.
Magic and mystery, produced bv all the
‘faking powers of the screen, are thrown
into the Lon Chaney picture, “The Unholy
Three, in which an amazing infant, Twee-
dledee—the “child wonder” of a circus—is
amusing. The Prince Edward, upon drop-
ping "The Iron Horse,” will introduce “The
\V anderer, ’ with a gala screening on Friday
of next week; the Crystal Palace is follow-
Ji’S snit, introducing a Syd Chaplin picture,
The Man on the Box,” in place of “The
• °t. Opera.” A point of interest
m "The Wanderer” is the presence in the
cast of Australia’s old friend Tyrone Power,
who was co-star here with Edith Crane.
** * *
Marie Burke has continued to do great
work at Adelaide Royal. But Warde Mor-
gan was not seen to the best advantage in
‘ Katja”; he is good singer and actor both,
biit has not the presence of a stage prince.
The occasion was a personal triumph for
Barrett Lenuard; the audience “eats” what-
fiver he gives it, and encourages him to drop
into mere buffoonery at odd moments. At
the Majestic Clem Dawe continues to give
the ptiblic sound humor, and Ivanoff to fur-
nish music that is something more than
sound. In pictures the York has a good
double, .Tack Holt in pursuit of a fine wild
white stallion 'Mesa,” and clever Lewis
Stone as princelet of some Ruritanian king-
dom ; in each ease the lady “opposite” is
overshadowed by the male performer. Also
djonte Blue has most of the limelight in a
thrilling railway drama at West’s, “The
Limited Mail. But at \Y ondergraph Colleen
Moore gets all the centre of the screen as
a very modern maiden.
“Loud.”: In fiction and the drama Aus-
tralian goldfields used to be convenient places
where a British hero could fill his pockets by
hard work and a little luck. In a new 7 Lon-
don-made picture, “One Colombo Night,”
Godfrey Tearle is landed with a lot of
rubber shares, then valueless, in Ceylon. He
comes away to Australia in the good old
style, but does not get any gold worth men-
tioning, only putting in time that way till
he hears that the inevitable boom in rubber
has placed him on top again. It is quite in
the spirit of the age that the happy future
of hero and heroine should depend on a
market gamble rather than on toil.
Poverty
Point
Goldilocks”: A scare about the effect of
the opening of the St. James’s Theatre with
another new showhouse to follow, helped
Billy Bussell to make a good bargain for
the 10-years lease of the Sydney Opera
House. Apart from his own Nellie Bramley
show 7 , he already lias the theatre booked up
until past the middle of next year, two of
E. J. Carroll’s ventures being among the
future tenants. In. spite of picture-show
competition, there should be room for addi-
tional playhouses in Sydney, especially as
the pictures have promoted show-going habits
among people who used to regard ’’theatre
night” as an exceptional treat instead of a
regular fixture. In the city itself the Opera
House (originally the Adelphi) and the St.
James’s are the only additions for 30 years,
a period which has seen the disappearance
as theatres of the Lyceum and the old Stand-
ard; and, touching vaudeville, against the
coming of Fullers’ Theatre (originally Bren-
nan’s Amphitheatre) the old Alhambra has
gone. When Sydney had a population of
70,000 and poor means of communication, it
kept a surprising number of theatres. The
Million City maintains curiously few.
“Wood’s Green” (Loud.) : As a bid for in-
creased public support, various changes have
been made in the cast of “The Student
Prince” at His Majesty’s, but Allan Prior,
“Australia’s leading tenor,” still sustains
the title-role. Kitty Reidy, who has done
well in “Wildflower,” is being featured as
a beauty actress in the London press. The
piece has now been transferred from the
Shaftesbury to the Adelphi Theatre. And.
thirdly, Snowy Baker in “His Last Race”
has just been featured at the King’s Cross
and other London cinemas.
“Csesar’s Ghost”: J. C. Williamson, Ltd.,
juggles amazingly with its people these days.
Harriet Bennet goes out of “Lilac Time”
into “Rose Marie.” Jimmy Hughes, Reginald
Dandy, George Bryant, Jean Robertson and
Floie Allen also transfer to the new piece—
Dandy from a part in “Katja,” in which he
superseded Herbert Browne, who was wanted
in “Lilac Time.” Lou Vernon was removed
from the “Give and Take” co. to “Polly with
a Past” in place of somebody required else-
where; and Roy Rene, also of “Give and
Take” till illness blotted him out of the
cast, drops back into vaudeville. Some
minor mummers are so shifted about they
can’t be sure they will be in any place or
co. for a month at a stretch. One I know
had a dozen changes in the course of last
year.
“Hamfat”: Having lent Rupert Julian (B.
6/5/’26) my dress-suit when he wanted to
appear at a trial
at the Tivoli, I
know how things
were with him in
his Australian
days. Julian was
a barber’s assistant
in Auckland w 7 ben
the stage called
him. In the. Maj-
eroni company,
w 7 ith which he
made his first pro-
fessional appear-
ance, he was re-
garded as the worst
actor it employed,
and, without re-
grets, Majeroni let
him go to the Stine
and Evans co.,
which wanted to
replace a simply
aw 7 ful juvenile
brought from
America. That co.
stranded Rupert in
Sydney. Subse-
quently, when he
was with William-
son’s, he married
a Titian - haired
lady who could
act, and it w r as
generally considered
that it was to keep
her that the Firm
gave him a regular
job. A few years
after he left Aus-
tralia he flashed
into prominence as
one of the directors
of the artistic Blue
Bird film co. ; and
everybody who
knew him here was
surprised. As a
director he struck
a more suitable
niche than as an
actor.
“R.K.D.N.”: Australian mummers are
looking down in the mouth—as well they
may—at the importation of an entire Ameri-
can company to play “The Best People,”
now 7 on view at Melbourne Athenaeum. The
queer thing is that the piece w 7 as recently
put on at the Loudon Lyric, where it scored
a hit mainly ow'ing to the excellence of the
all-English cast which was engaged for it.
Australia’s old footlights favorite Henrietta
Watson in particular distinguished herself.
Why it should be necessary to have Ameri-
cans to play the piece in this country and
not iu England is one of those things no
one on Poverty Point—or off it —can under-
stand.
"Flaming Youth”: The Firm's publicity
pars suggest that Australian flesh may be
made to creep by the introduction of Grand
Guignol plays. Suspicions point to Scott
Alexander, now with the "White Cargo”
co., who is an experienced Grand Guig-
nolian. lie played with the Paris co. and
produced some of the horrors at the Century
Theatre, London. By the way, the Cen-
tury is now owned by Lena Ashwell, who
is gratefully remembered by Diggers for her
assiduity in entertaining them with her
concert parties during the war.
“Bill O’C.” : The Covent Garden Opera
Syndicate, which wound up its last London
season with a stiff loss, publishes an interest-
ing table showing how all the 13 operas pro-
duced ranked for popularity, costliness and
profit. _ Results were a little peculiar.
"Tosca,” the biggest profit-maker, was first
also in popularity, and eighth in cost. The
runner-up was "Rigoletto,” which, though
seventh in popular esteem, was last in cost.
The third in profit, “Butterfly,” was twelfth
in both popularity and cost. The financial
dud seems to have been “Rosenkavalier,”
which, though second in popularity to
“Tosca,” was the costliest of the productions
and ninth in profit. “Fliogendc Hollander,”
“Lohengrin” and “Die Walkure” were des-
perately unprofitable. The orchestras of the
Teutonic group cost 73 p.c. more and the
chorus 40 p.c. more than the Italian outfits.
Nevertheless the syndicate is gamely includ-
ing the “Ring” cycle in its next season’s pro-
gramme.
“Tenakohe”: Charlie Berkeley (B.
29/4/’26) was a clerk in the N.Z. Insurance
Co.’s office at Auckland—lie is a native of
Maoriland—before he went on the stage. He
had his ups and downs, but he was good in
anything, from comic opera to melodrama,
and personally he was always popular.
Frank Gerald was another Auckland clerk
before he took to the boards. Frank became
a mummer about the same time as Charlie,
but adventured farther and made good in
London after coming to grief in Australia
with his partner, Stilling Duff.
“Glen A.”: Nellie Stewart’s reappearance
recalls.that one of J. O. Williamson’s earliest
law-suits was fought when, in association with
Garner and Musgrove, he met an action
for £2500 damages brought by Emilie Mel-
ville. That was 43 years ago. It was
claimed that Williamson, Garner and Mus-
grove had broken Miss Melville’s contract be-
cause they had got Miss Stewart to play in
“La Mascotte” at a much smaller salary.
The Court had an idea that there was some-
thing in it, and the star collected £9OO.
“Curtain-Raiser”: The recrudescence of
Gilbert and Sullivan opera revives the old
controversy about the nationality of the in-
teresting pair. Sullivan’s father was a regi-
mental bandmaster in Dublin. His grand-
father was an immigrant from London, and
the family name is alleged to have been Solo-
mon. Gilbert’s middle name was Schwenck.
which has been held to support the assertion
that his surname was originally Ginsberg.
If these stories are true, Judah should not
be deprived of two of its glories merely for
patriotic reasons.
“Caul-boy”: If Pavlova takes £20,000 out
of this country, as suggested by “S.G.” (B.
8/4/’26), she will at least have earned it
more than most of the amusers Australia
pays high prices to see. The average jazz
comedy arrives as a manuscript whoso
choicest gems of wit have preceded it by
several years, accompanied by second-rate
vaudeville artists whose “personality” is
created for them by the press-agent, its scenic
embellishments consisting of a couple of
mediocre sets to be eked out by odd pieces
from local stock. It runs for three to five
months in the two largest cities. Pavlova
brought 75 tons of stage merchandise and
the complete settings for over 20 ballets,
several of which will never be unpacked be-
cause of a fear that a public gorged with
American rubbish won’t know how to appre-
ciate them. Some of the performers have
travelled as far as Japan to acquire the
right atmosphere for a dance that takes five
minutes in the showing. And the longest
run in any of the cities isn’t likely to be
more than five weeks.
“Voice Off”: Lincoln Plumer, the admir-
able Inspector Burke who was foiled by
Muriel Stai’r in “Within the Law,” is now
acting in the strong, silent Hollywood drama.
I saw him the other night in an alleged
comedy; he had plates broken over his head,
food thrown at him, and more comic out-
rages lavished on him than any dummy clown
in a circus. Plumer seemed too good an
actor to be downed with custard-pies.
“Kir”: Touching that recent reference to
Bland Holt's thunderstorm in “The Breaking
of the Drought” which resulted in the cast
receiving a drenching nightly, Oscar Asclm
is another stickler for realism. When lie
presented “The Merry Wives of Windsor”
in Australia he insisted on the use of salt
for the snow scene. Paper he scorned as
“artificial.”
(Continued on page 39.)
THE APPEAL.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
When Mistress Bracegirdle was queen of the stage,
And Betterton old but a juvenile still
And young Colley Cibber had words as a page,
With his name in small type at the foot of the
bill,
There were bold things and wild things and wicked
things said,
But the plays must appeal to the heart and the head.
On first nights the ladies came masked to the stalls.
They knew they must blush if their faces were
seen;
But they flirted their fans and looked nice in their
shawls
And knew what the dramatist’s verses might mean,
For it’s left upon record the wittiest parts
Were the ones that appealed to their heads and their
hearts.
Now Mistress Bracegirdle has yielded her crown
To a lady without an idea in her head ;
Press agents attend to the thing called renown,
And old Bettertons find they are counted as dead.
The slim things and slight things and dull things
appear
With a shallow appeal to the eye and the ear.
'I he ladies have long ceased to wear their blush
masks;
in fact, they have ceased to wear most things as
well.
Producers, not actors, are keen on their tasks,
And what most plays are written for no one can
tell.
The crowd, greatly bored, sits the weary thing out,
But only the dullest know what it’s about.
COULDN’T BE OTHERWISE.
THE J.C.W. CHORUS-GIRL : “You should see our leading lady’s
presents—dozens and dozens of them.”
THE OTHER PEOPLE’S DITTO: “Yes, darling — that’s why they call
her a gifted actress.”
Bring Mistress Bracegirdle again to the fore,
Let Betterton rouge his old face into youth;
Biing the wit that was then in the fashion once more
To the aid of old drama that looked at the truth.
Let the bold things and wild things and bad things
be said
If the play but appeal to the heart and the head.
x.s.w.

"AGM.” (Lond.) : Another American
play has been put up at another London
theatre under the Shubert aegis, although the
American managers only a few months ago
tried to soothe English public opinion by say-
ing that they would merely let their group
of theatres, and not use them for Manhattan
successes. This time it is the Apollo Theatre
with'“ls Zat So?” a comedy by James Glea-
son and Richard Taber. To be candid, it
is so full of good things that its origin is
likely to be forgotten. It is the story of a
boxer and his manager, who, to get out of
financial difficulties, engage as butler and
footman in a smart family. Gleason and
Armstrong, the two comedians, are clever,
Gleason, the part-author, making his char-
acter very similar to Dennis’s Sentimental
Bloke.
“Simo the Spruiker”: I've spruiked in pul-
pits, on hotel-balconies and off lorries and
haystacks, but the hardest spruik ever I did
was over the wireless. The announcer told
me I mustn't wave my hands (my only
weapons of emphasis) as nobody would sec
me. I couldn’t stand upright, but had to
double up in order to talk into a disc resem-
bling a man’s ear lowered to within three
feet of the floor. I was also told not to
breathe into the machine, because a breath
becomes a hurricane if it travels far enough.
There was a row of “artists” in the studio
waiting their turn, and in vain I turned to
thetii for a handclap as I jumbled along. I
didn't know at the time that they were under
bond not to even sneeze lest the concussion
should be barnacled on to my spruik as it
travelled through the vasty spaces. These
wireless “studios” are fair cockatoos at pick-
ing up sounds. The whistling girl who came
on after me only just winked her approval
after my peroration, and a man up country,
writing me later, said, “I not only heard your
speech, but I heard the doors bang together
after they fired you out.”
“Wood's Green” (London) : Twenty years
ago the Censor refused to license the public
performance of “Airs. Warren’s Profession.”
Now that this stricture has been released,
Shaw has taken his revenge by inserting
some new gibes at England’s “cant, hypocrisy
and humbug.” Arthur Bourchicr now
plays the part Julius Knight acted in the
first presentation, which was given in
private. Fanny Brough was then the Mrs.
Warren, now in the capable hands of Edith
Goodall.
“Flaming Youth” : Billy Russell grew up
on the business side of the theatre with the
Firm, but he once had a shot at acting with
a co. on tour with “Within the Law.” He
doubled the part of front-of-th e-house man-
ager with that of the shopwalker in the
Fenn-Wimperis thriller. The praise he re-
ceived from other members of the co. almost
induced him to let his hair grow. William
was dreaming about futui-e histrionic suc-
cesses when the co. reached the metropolis
and the news was gently broken to him that
an extra man was to be added to play the
charactei*. “You did very w’ell, my boy, in
the smalls,” he was told, “but in the city
we had better have a real actor.”
“Wood’s Green” (London) : The stage has
not shown any ardent desire to open its
arms to titled playwrights. The other day
Lord Lathom was flogged by the critics, and
his successor, Vera, Countess Catheart, whose
“Ashes” was produced simultaneously in
Washington and London, has been still more
unfortunate. In the American production
Lady Catheart herself played the leadiug
role, but even that was not sufficient to give
the drama interest. As a prologue it was
explained in the Washington theatre that
the play was the unvarnished life-story of
the Countess, and, such being the case, one
could not form a very high opinion of Lord
Craven, with whom she eloped to South
Africa a few years ago. By the way, the gay
Lord has only one leg, which still is one
more than the play has.
“Minim”: James M. Glover, the conductor
and musical critic, is responsible for this
Alelba story. On a voyage to Australia the
prima donna was begged to sing at the usual
seamen’s charity concert. Interrupted at a
game of bridge, she was asked to allow hex-
name to be put down for the concert sub-
committee. “Sub-committee!” returned Mad-
ame, “you ask me—Melba—who have always
been top-dog, to go on a sxih-committee? I
have never been so insulted in my life!”
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The Australian-made
“Queen of Crime” (B. G/o/’26) was written
by Pat Fixxn. Pat turned out a number of
plays which were popular in “the provinces”
hut unknown to metropolitan audiences. A
generation ago the touring co. was glad to
get hold of plays with an Australian flavor:
people in the country towns liked them, and
people in the cities might have liked them,
too, if the managements had given them a
chance.
“Goldilocks”: A good-natured theatrical
manager, who has extended many kindnesses
to a mummer of the always-in-difficulties
sort, felt annoyed when he was dragged to
the police court to give evidence as to the
aetor-r’s character, moral turpitude having
been alleged. He did his best for the cause
of the annoyance; but a chance for one shot
was too much for him. “You know Air.
Blank as an actor by profession?” Blank’s
advocate asked. “Yes,” assented the manager
—“by profession.”
“Hamfat”: During the day our leading
man, Augustus Roax-ei-, angered at Henry
Garrick Hasbeen’s comments on his acting,
had referred bitterly to the estimate the
management placed op Hasbeen’s services, as
reflected by the amount against his name
on the salary-list, when there happened to
be a salary-list; and by show-time Hasbeen.
having sought the usual consolation, was
ripe. We thought he was ripe for sleep, and
were afraid he might drop into slumber over
his lines; but he woke up suddenly at the
place where, in the guise of a feeble old man,
he bad been rescued from ruffians by the
dashing hero (Roarer). The sight of his
toemy defying all the world (the villain and
three supers) and taking the limelight at his
expense brought back in a flood a memory of
all his wrongs. “I’ll fight you meself, you
blithering skite!” he yellexl. With that he
plucked away his grey wig and whiskers and
hurled himself on the astonished Roarer.
The other players, as they rushed on the
stage endeavoring to separate the combatants,
tangled themselves with the scenery; and
the Alpine cliffs and the village inn crumpled
down on top of them. Amidst shouts and
shrieks of hilarity from the “house” the
curtain was lowered. As the local paper
put it in winding up an appreciative notice,
“the management explained that the fifth
act shown on the programme was merely
there through a mistake on the part of the
printer.”
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Basil Dean has de-
cided to give Eugene O’Neill another run in
London: he is to stage “The Great God
Brown,” with Noel Coward in the principal
part. In this his latest play, O’Neill revives
the old Greek custom of providing the actors
with masks, which impediments they remove
when they desire to reveal their real char-
acter. That Coward should be engaged for
the leading r6le is a tribute to his versatility.
London wouldn’t be surprised to hear that
the remarkable young man had challenged
Dempsey or wa.s to captain the English team
in the Test matches.
“Ller”: Maisy Steele, now retired after
many years’ stage-dancing, proudly points to
a small indentation in her forehead. Danc-
ing one night at Ted Holland’s show at Bris-
bane, she kicked herself on the forehead —
with her knee: —knocking herself to Dream-
land. The audience thought it was the finale
and roared its applause for the good acting;
but there was no encore.
Narrative of a South-streeter: —
1 once toured midland Victoria with a party of
amateurs who wooed the Tragic Muse, sometimes
subconsciously and unintentionally, in the cause of
an Anglican parish. The usual thing—a couple of
sketches humorously called French, a chorus or two,
recitations and songandance stuff. We invaded a
mountain village, “pumping” ourselves there on a
railway trolley because the winter roads were im-
passable, and landed in the middle of a feud. We
had booked the school, Which had a stage, but the
schoolmaster refused us admission. He entrenched
himself behind Regulation X463J and bade us do
our worst —not, of course, meaning our three-act
drama. Straightway the village ranged itself into
opposing camps. Ihe Metnodists lent us their church
for a hall, the Presbyterians supplemented the Metho-
dists’ stock of seats, the Baptists trundled in a
piano and the Catholic stationmaster supplied most of
the stage—truck-loading gang-planks laid on kerosene-
cases—furnishings being borrowed from houses round-
about. Wc had neither drop nor backcloth, and
our dressing-room was a plaid rug tacked across the
o.p. back corner of the improvised stage. Women'
players took it in turn to change behind this, their
legs thrilling an audience so large that a row of
infants squatted along the front of the stage and
another of four- and five-year-olds stood behind them.
Men players changed their upper-garments coram
populo and their nether ones behind the piano. At
the end of an item the stage-manager proclaimed, |
after the Elizabethan manner, that the audience might
now consider the drop dropped; and the whole
company shifted scene in full view' of everybody.
A hastily-written interpolated verse which brought
opprobrium upon the schoolmaster completed the
conquest of the audience. The whole village, barring
the dominie, played us back to our trolley with
mouth-organs, declaring it had been the greatest
night Mountaintopville had known.
“Tarboy”: What strikes me when I come
to the city is the ignorance of the townie.
The missus and two of the kids came
down with me to see our cattle sold,
and we went to the pantomime one night.
It was something about “The Cow Jumped
Over the Moon.” The show was a bit dull
till the cow? came in. She was a scrubber
with long horns and no udders to speak of.
Two of her quarters were missing, and she
wasu’t worth a quid; in fact, you couldn’t
give her away to-day. They had this cow
so fixed that she would laugh. Laugh ! I
nearly burst, and so did the missus and kids.
But there wasn’t another laugh in the crowd.
We had it all to ourselves. There were cries
of “Get your whiskers cut!” “Put ’em out!”
and so on. But I didn’t care; and, besides,
they’d have had a job on their hands any-
way. At last I had to get up and tell the
crowd at the back about it. I said: “Why,
(he blasted cow has a horse’s mouth —teeth
top and bottom.” Then they laughed pro-
perly. I should think they would! Fancy
waiting for a man from the bush to tell them
that! Well, do y’ know, every time that cow
came on the stage she looked at me and
laughed, and when I laughed—why, every-
body joined in. Even the parson at home
laughed when I got back and told him—and
he’s pretty dry hash.
“S.T.S.”: The strongest piece of cynicism
I have struck lately is that of Robert Bench-
ley, the American critic. He finds the musi-
cal comedies of to-day are getting cleaner
than those of yesterday. And he puts it
that there are more of them now “to which
one can take the children, without having to
ask them what the sex references mean.”
“Ller”: When the tram I was travelling
in was nearing an outer suburb, three little
girls standing on the kerb screamed in con-
cert and looked awestruck at the front of
the tram. Everyone on board jumped up
to see what had happened. The tramguard
supplied the details. “That’s old stuff with
me, he said. “Those kids are picture-
acting. That’s one of their Hollywouldn’t
stunts.”
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : The first production
of Sean O’Casey’s third play, “The Plough
and the Stars,” caused something of a riot
at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Like “Juno
and the Paycock,” it reeks of politics, but
whereas in “Juno” only those having a real
knowledge of Irish affairs could detect the
prejudice against the Republican movement,
that prejudice is plainly avowed in the new
drama. Hence the hostile demonstration on
the first night. In Patrick Pearse’s day
practically all the Abbey Players shared in
his dreams, and W. B. Yeats was counted a
fellow-enthusiast. Since then Yeats has gone
over to the Free State, of which he is a
Senator; and owing to his influence the Gov-
ernment has made a small annual subsidy
to the Abbey Theatre. “The Plough aDd the
Stars,” wonderfully clever, is again a study
of the slums, apd £ sordid study at that. And
the Irish people are getting a bit sick of
plays which deal only with all the most un-
attractive qualities of their race. Even
joyous Sydney could not stand a repertory
theatre which devoted a decade or two to
intrigues in Woolloomooloo or drab happen-
ings in the Never Never.

You're past repair.
I paid a fair price
For a umbrella brand-new—
For quality, old friend,
’Tis inferior to you.
From the force of winds
And peltering rain,
You’re battered and torn,
And your wires rent a twain.
You rendered good service
And worthy a rhyme
For a humble memento
Of rough winter time.

“Ratio”: Re Vic. estate-agents’ charges
(B. 15/4/’26), “the percentage fixed by cus-
tom” yields about £3O on a £lOOO property,
5 p.c. on the first £3OO, 24 on the remainder.
Occasionally, for fear of losing a sale, a few
pounds less will be accepted. Public ser-
vants and bank officials, always liable to be
transferred to towns where suitable houses
to rent are rare, and hence forced to buy or
to store their furniture for long periods, are
good marks. These are recommended, in a
casual way, to an agent in the town to which
they are proceeding, a sociable custom which,
if it results in a sale, means a cut of the com-'
mission for the first agent. The commission
is obviously out of all proportion to the work
done, but a vendor has little chance of a
sale by private treaty. The expensive traffic
could be stopped if a registrar of properties
were appointed in each of the district
centres. Vendors could have full particulars
of their properties, with the prices, entered
in a register which would he open to inspec-
tion by buyers, who would then bargain
directly with the sellers. A flat rate of £
p.c. would be ample commission, and would
easily pay the registrar’s salary. In his
spare time he might take over some of the
duties, such as savings-bank and pension
business, now performed by postal officials
and the police. It is time this or some other
plan was adopted so that A might sell his
property to B without the intervention of
a talkative, expensive and unnecessary O.

ANNA PAVLOVA
the famous dancer, states that people in this
country are not fully aware of the vital relation-
ship between music and dancing. She says the
difficulty with a new country is that the perfect
combination of music and dance has not yet been
presented . . . .
Pavlova has certainly amazed us by uniting these
two arts in a perfect combination, has revealed to
us a splendid medium of expressing emotion, in
fact, has given us a new art treasure
SECURE the BEST MUSIC
If YOU desire to dance perfectly you must have the best
music. And the best music is obtained by utilising Paling’s
renowned instruments. Their Player Pianos provide the
medium through which the art of dancing can be raised to
its highest possible pinnacle.

British Cars for I
British People •
The new Sunbeam three-litre sporting
car is the fastest ever produced. It
embodies all the experience in engine
design and chassis construction which
has made Sunbeam cars supreme in the
racing world. Its body work is typical
of Sunbeam easy luxury and fine
appearance, and it comes as a worthy
addition to the fine range of touring
models which are already famous for
their inimitable performance and re-
liability.

“C. Coral”: Although pearl-shell is very
low in price just now, its button-making
substitute, trochus, is fetching over £lOO a
ton ; hence the luggers are being turned on
to the “susu,” as the natives call it. This
is not the highest price that trochus has
reached; during the war it went up to about
£l3O, but the present figure allows a fair
margin of profit. Still it is a tricky market,
and the price may thud at any moment.
* » * *
“W.C.W.” : The manager of the Brisbane
Electric Light Co. challenges anyone (B.
22/4/’26) to show where his co. is not top-
notch. For the William-street plant the fuel
is carried from Ipswich by train to Iloma-
street, thence to the power-house by electric
lorry. For the new plant at Doughboy Creek
it will go all the way by train. Why? Would
it not be cheaper and better and less risky
to have the power-houses at the coalpit?
If Niagara can supply N. York an'd Morwell
(Melb.) can supply Albury, why can’t
Ipswich supply Brisbane?
"X2X”: The effects produced at Port
Adelaide after a quantity of burnt sugar
had got into the water must have
had some other origin than the one
suggested (B. 22/4/’26). Since sugar
consists of only carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen, with the last two elements in chemi-
cal combination in the same proportions as
in water, the only effect of heat on it is to
drive off the hydrogen and the oxygen as
steam, leaving the pure carbon behind in the
form of charcoal. This substance, only
slightly soluble in water, would scarcely be
capable of killing fish, corroding metal or
doing any of the other things claimed for
it.
* * * *
“Clerk”: Clapp has just taken delivery
of two new Garratt engines, manufactured
in England by Beyer and Peacock, for the
45-mile iColac-Crowes and 25-miles Moc-
Walhalla narrow-gauge lines. None of Vic-
toria’s four 2ft. Gin. lines, which extend in
all 119 miles, pay, but it is estimated that
these locos, will reduce operating costs by
more than £12,000 a year. If it is decided
to run engines of this type on tlm other
narrow-gauge lines (Wangaratta-Whitfield
and Fern Tree Gully-Gembrook), the New-
port workshops will get the job of construct-
ing them. By bringing the first two from
England the Department reckons it saved
£lO,OOO-odd, or the price of an engine.
* * * *
“Kriz”: At the close of last year the
ruling price in Broome for mother o’ pearl-
shell was a little under £2OO per ton. The
buyers have opened the 1926 season by offer-
ing £165, which barely covers working ex-
penses. After the yearly re-fit of luggers,
importing indented labor and advancing
money to divers and crew, the pearler is on
his uppers till his first “take” of shell comes
in. This is where the American buyer gets
his chance to play Thursday Island against
Broome. The small man who can’t afford
to hang on to his shell takes what he can
get and starts his lugger out to sea on the
possible chance of a pearl that will recoup
him, and so the gamble goes on. One of
these days Broome and Thursday Island will
combine and regulate their shell on to the
market, and the Yank will have to pay a
fair price.
* * * *
“Jesmond” : No need to go to France to
see chicory under cultivation (B. 15/4/'26)
when Phillip Island (Vic.) sends out a kiln-
dried chicory equal to the world’s best.
There is something in the air or soil that
gives a “milling” quality to the local crop
which is not found in that of any other
country. Forty-odd years ago caterpillars
and birds loaded the dice against Island
grain-growers, and many left the district in
disgust. Then the local storekeeper asked
Baron von Mueller for his opinion, and that
fine old scientist did Australia another good
turn by advising that mustard and chicory
were the most suitable crops. Mustard, being
easy to grow, was most favored at first, but
it was not long before every farm had its
acre or two of chicory as well. In a few
years mustard was being attacked in the
same way as the cereals ; presently birds, a
fly and the “take-all” grub made mustard-
growing impossible. But chicory, so far, has
defied all pests, and is keeping an ever-in-
creasing number of people in comfort.
Though the work is hard and the market
fluctuates, nine years out of ten the Islanders
can rely on a fair return. So they continue
to dig chicory out of the ground, to the
amazement of thousands of visitors who
always expect to find it growing like a bean.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Man in business, respectable kind, wishes meet
young Woman.”— Age view mat. ad.
What is he, I wonder, the chap
Who stresses his lily-white trade?
A butcher or baker mayhap,
A snip in some busy arcade ?
To hearten some diffident maid
Is the simple assurance designed
That the biz with which bills will be paid
Is the purely respectable kind?
No private detective or “trap”—
That much I imagine’s conveyed;
No “urger” who gives you a “snap”
Where clamorous odds are being laid.
Aye, even the Ikey brigade
And Bung he may have in his mind,
Reluctant such persons to grade
Among the respectable kind.
Does he fruit in receptacles wrap
That the damaged may notice evade?
Do you hear from the rostrum his yap
Where fables outrageous are brayed?
For a sharemarket scoop, or a raid.
Or a squeeze will you find him inclined,
Where “killings” or “punches” are made
Of a highly respectable kind? .
Envoy.
I want the constituents weighed
And measured, the pathways defined
Where commerce is only essayed
Of the sheerly respectable kind.

ARKvS Ei.
“Chancery Lane”: Re the controversy
about policemen’s headgear. In Victoria a
John Hop always wears his helmet in court,
whether it be the Supreme Court or the
Petty Sessions.
South Aus. has only two Anglican bishops,
and they are both named Thomas. The
Adelaide man distinguishes himself by call-
ing himself Nutter Thomas. The other,
Richard, of Willochra, follows Gilbert
White, who came from Queensland too.
“C.M.”: I suspect that there are plenty
of exceptions to “Morice’s” alleged rule that
blue-eyed persons never produce brown-eyed
children (B. 29/4/’26). My mother is one
of a family of 10; her father and mother
were blue-eyed. She and a sister and a
brother are the only blue-eyed ones in the
quiverful; all the others are brown-eyed.
“C.Q.”: Geelong (Vic.) has put up what
must nearly be a record for a non-capital
city in land appreciation. A block 59ft. by
99ft. sold during the war for £ll,ooo—£lBo
per ft. frontage. After 15ft. had been lopped
off the frontage, it changed hands the other
day at £6OO a foot.
“Coot”: Victoria’s Railway Commissioner
Clapp is thorough. Employees have recently
been circularised that the regulation requir-
ing the removal of buttons from old uniforms
and caps, and the forwarding of them to the
chief storekeeper, is not being satisfactorily
observed, and that the buttons must be sent
in.
When the Finnish training-ship Fennia
sails from Melbourne for Chile and the Baltic
one of the men who will help to heave her
anchor will be Charles Howlett, a graduate
in Arts and Law of Melbourne University.
His monthly wage will be threepence. He is
a well-known amateur mummer, and by a co-
incidence his last appearance—with the
Repertorians in Galsworthy’s “Show” —was
as a member of the silent service.
“C. Bumpkin”: A steamer berthed at Mel-
bourne the other day which came out from
England with nobody at the wheel. There
was an officer of the watch and a masthead
lookout, but, except for 24 hours of a heavy
gale, the gyroscope kept the vessel on her
course. I am prepared to accept this as a
great triumph for science, but I doubt
whether it will add to the safety of sea-
travel. The old-fashioned helmsman had to
keep his attention fixed on his charge’s nose.
That necessity kept him alert. But with
this new device there will be little to stop
a man’s mind from wandering on a long
watch.
“Mako”: Until a few years ago I would
have endorsed the statement that blue-eyed
parents never have brown-eyed children (B.
29/4/’26), but I know a brown-eyed girl
whose mother and father have blue eyes
with no hint of grey in them. When brown-
eyed parents have blue-eyed children it usu-
ally means that while most of the blue eyes
change to brown, as kittens’ change to green,
some remain the original blue, though of
course crowds of people are dark-eyed from
birth. Another interesting item about eyes
is that while grey eyes are not uncommon
the world does not possess a grey-eyed race.
“Harold Hardupp”: Some idea of leap-
ing pub values in Sydney was given by the
evidence in a recent bankruptcy case that
the lease of the Star Hotel, George-street—
where many a Bulletin cheque has been
cashed —was sold in 1923 for £16,500, and
resold 18 months later for £24,000. When
the Daily Telegraph bought Usher’s Hotel
for its present building it paid £14,000 com-
pensation for the loss of the license (sub-
sequently revived for the new premises),
and that was regarded as a thumping sum
at the time, though Usher’s was one of
Sydney’s noted pubs. But in 10 years all
ideas of values have been transmogrified.
“X.D.”: When Mrs. Mary Scales, who re-
cently successfully appealed to the Privy
Council in a wiil case, had her den of mys-
tery in the Sydney Royal Arcade, she had
the practical protection, as against the
police, of prominent plain-clothes men. She
mentioned in court as evidence of her psychic
powers that the police often came to her for
aid. They did, the reason being that crim-
inals, a superstitious lot, went to her, too.
Police officers, apparently only anxious to
know whether a certain ticket in Tatt.’s
woud win a prize, would suddenly disclose
a fugitive anxiety about a friend, whose de-
scription was supplied. The seeress, eager
to show her cleverness, would remember, if
the man had been to see her, quite a lot
about him. It was when she ceased to be
useful, after criminals had lost their faith
ii' her, that the police lost their interest in
her, too. Whereupon, of course, the pro-
phetess’s shop was closed.
Ella Doyle, of the League of Nations staff,
Geneva:—
To-night as I went up the Avenue de l’Opera
towards one of the Duval restaurants a smiling
sandwiehman handed me, with a marvellous bow and
his left hand —his right arm was off—an advertise-
ment slip. It advertised “Le Petit Vatel,” where one
could obtain for four-francs-fifty, “sans supplement,'’
a lunch or a dinner comprising hors d’ceuvre or soup,
meat, fish or eggs, vegetables or salad, dessert or
cheese, bread “at discretion,” wine, beer or soda-
water. Vatel—l tried vainly to recall where I had
heard the name. During dinner I read the Morning
Post and found this in the “agony” column:—
Blush, ye dull and witless letter-writers of to-day,
and hang your heads, for this is the anniversary of
the death of the ever-adorable Madame de Sevigne.'
That gave me the link. I recalled a ruined villa
and its ruined garden at Villers-Bretonneux in the
spring of 1919, and a large book of French history
lying sodden and dirty among the broken bricks and
newly-shooting bushes, open at an engraving of
Madame de Sevigne, ringleted, smiling and plump.
Among her letters was one about Vatel, the maitre
d’hotel of the Prince of Conde, who killed himself on
the night of CondS’s dinner at Chantilly to Louis
XIV. He had planned the dinner for a certain
number of people, but unexpected guests came, and
there was not enough roast meat to go round. And
although fish had been ordered from all the seaports
only one lot had arrived. The harassed man could
bear no more; he considered that his honor was gone.
In spite of the assurances of the Prince that all was
going well, he went to his room and threw himself
on his sword, not once, but thrice. And then, of
course, the fish arrived. Somehow I felt glad that
though a fiercer light is beating just now on Brillat-
Savarin, gastronomer and author of “La Physiologie
du Goflt,” the centenary of whose death is to be
commemorated in a week or two by a wonderful
dinner, Vatel’s memory is kept green in at least one
spot.

does for my skin
what Rexona Soap
will; it keeps it

It Means Health and Beauty.
Rexona, and Rexona Soap are the Rexona Hi id's aids to beauty. With their assistance
she rids her skin of blemishes and pimples, keeps her hair and scalp in such perfect con-
dition that she is the envy of all her friends. But the Rexona Girl is not selfish —she does
not keep the secret to herself, but wishes all the world to rejoice with her. Over 5000 girls
have written to the Company the glad' news that they are Rexona Girls, and find the
Rexona Products the most wonderful aids to health and beauty.
They say that Rexona Soap keeps their skin and hair healthy and beautiful, and
should be used by every girl who values her good looks. They say they are always find-
ing new uses for Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, and many of
their letters contain a photo-
graph which shows, by its
beauty, that these users are
getting the best results in
health and happiness. Are

The Scatterbrain Bradys.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
THE scatterbrain Bradys were men in
their time,
Not given, ’tis rumored, to work or
to rhyme; ,
Just gay Irish squires who were .ond ot tlve
o-iass
And cursed' with quick eyes for the lines
of a lass.
These scatterbrain Bradys
Were lovers of ladies,
But rive ui virus, and if so let it pass!
Now Clare is the county, God help us, we
hear, . ,
Where springtime is always the time ot tne
Where salmon and trout you can catch when
you try
With a hook of blackthorn attached to a fly.
The salmon and trout there
Are ready, no doubt there,
For anyone’s pleasure to willingly die.
The hares are the wildest that anywhere
run.
You’ve got to be quick, my fine friend, with
your gun.
Or early uprising and swift with the snare
To dodge the gamekeepers and catch, if you
dare,
The four-footed creature
That makes such a feature
Of sporting in March o’er the green hills
of Clare.
These days, so they whisper, ’tis not counted
right
When stalking a sodjer to shoot him on
sight;
You don’t pot him sitting, but give him,
we hear,
A chance to make covert if anywhere near.
And proctors are barred now.
They’re making it hard now—
• Twill" soon be close season for landlords,
they fear.
At hockey and hurling, at handball or fives
They led the whole country the dance of their
lives;
To run or to rastle, to jig or to fight
They’d challenge the world, and, I’m sorry to
write,
To gamble bc-jabers
At cards with their neighbors
Would help them to gather the bloom of the
night.
But, telling of hunting, each graceless spal-
peen
Was sure to be found when the hunt would
convene
In galloping trim by Tomgraney’s old wall.
With necks in the balance, what odds to a
fall
When Burkes and Moloneys
On hunters and ponies
Must ride hell-for-leather to pace them at all ?
There’s trouble in Kielty and worse at
Mynoe,
But bailiff or bishop to blazes can go!
The pack in such fettle has never been seen;
To keep them they've pawned all the plate
at Raheen.
The scatterbrain Bradys
Beside the O’Gradys
Must follow a fox to the finish I ween....
Well, peace to their ashes! Sure, life at
the most
Is short and uncertain. I’ll give ye a toast
In claret, or if ye’d prefer it, potheen—
’Twas gaily ye lived in your days at Raheen.
So, scatterbrain Bradys,
“To Life and the Ladies!
May Hell’s road for want of traffic grow
green!”
Victoria.
E. J. BRADY.
Luck.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u T 'TJ'ILSON, you’re a vacuous idiot!”
V\ Jim Mullins, old-time school
friend and mentor, smiled ami-
ably across his office table. “Merely because
the Maoriland steamer has delayed her
sailing for a few hours, you come here on
the verge of tears and expect me to satisfy
your craving for society in the meantime.
Well, you’re asking too much. I’ve just
finished lunch, and am due at an important
conference in half an hour, so you'll have to
take your woes elsewhere.”
“But where am I to go?” I exclaimed.
“You need a tonic” —Mullins's grin was
almost contemptuous—-“and I believe I can
put a good one in your way. I’ll send yon
down to spend the afternoon with an old
friend of mine—the luckiest and most con-
tented man I’ve ever met. It will do you
good to meet him.”
“Sounds refreshing, anyhow,” I rejoined
languidly. "It's just possible this paragon
and I won't bore each other. Where do I
find him?”
“You won’t bore him” —Mullins spoke
with assurance as he scribbled out an
address and passed it over to me—“and if
lie bores you then I’m done with you for-
ever. His name’s Hope, and he lives at No.
210 Jasmine-street, Miller’s Point. I’ve
written everything down in case it might
fatigue you to remember it.”
My destination proved to be the end house
of a grimy terrace in a dirty and depressing
neighborhood. For a full minute I hesitated
at the gate, wondering what fool’s trick Mul-
lins had played on me this time. I found
it impossible to associate luck and content-
ment with those squalid surroundings, but
the thought of an otherwise barren after-
noon decided me, and I rang the door-bell.
Inquiring for Mr. Hope, I was ushered up-
stairs and shown to a door at the extreme
end of the passage. Left to myself I knocked
and waited, noting the faded linoleum, the
gaudy strip of carpet and the broken sky-
light. No response, though I knocked again
and again. Then, partly because my curi-
osity had been aroused and partly because
lack of ceremony appeared to be the usual
thing at No. 210, I pushed open the door
and went in, determined to await the arrival
of the mysterious Mr. Hope.
It was strange how the sordid atmosphere
of that sordid locality dropped from me like
a cloak as I closed the door behind me. lhe
room, though poorly furnished and possess-
ing- no apparent luxuries, was actually cheer-
ful, like a deliberately cheerful nursery.
Bright cushions relieved the monotony ot
cane chairs, and the floor and walls were
spotless. The windows boasted no curtains,
but they positively glittered with cleanli-
ness. A forget-me-not pattern that strayed
over the prevailing blush-pink of the wall-
paper fitted into the picture by some miracle,
and on the centre table a yellow-brown cloth
made a good background for a vase of nas-
turtiums and one or two brightly-bound
books. A second table was littered with
that orderly disorder which bespeaks the
activities of a methodical man. It was cov-
ered with a collection of rough sketches,
mostly in color, of some fantastic person
who did not appear to be grown up. In the
very centre was the framed oil-painting of
a young girl whose regular features and
golden curls formed a picture of striking
beauty.
I was stooping forward for a closer in-
spection when I heard the sound of cough-
ing in the hall and a succession of awkward
footfalls outside the door of the room I w T as
in. A momentary pause, and in stumped
the queerest person I had ever seen.
The newcomer was tal 1 and spare, with
one leg as Nature intended it and one apology
in wood. A pair of sloping shoulders cul-
minated in a long neck, upon which was set
a little round head and the most remarkable
face imaginable. I’ale, wrinkled like a with-
ered apple, it looked like the face belonging
to one who had weathered years of mortal
changes and stress without losing the trust-
ful freshness of childhood. . As ,he came
farther into the room, I noticed that he had
lost an eye, and that his resemblance to a
baby was heightened by the absurd flaxen
down beneath his cap. The cordial twinkle
in his one serviceable eye seemed to call for
some advance on my part, so I turned and
faced him, feeling somewhat at a loss.
“I’m afraid I’m an intruder here,” I said,
“but my friend Mullins sent me with an in-
troduction to Mr. Hope. I found the place
empty, and thought I’d wait.”
“I’m Hope,” he said, holding out his hand,
“and I’ll venture a guess you’re the Mr.
Wilson that Mullins is always telling me
about when he comes here. I’m home later
than usual, and delighted that you were
good enough to wait. Sit down and make
yourself comfortable. I went for a walk
to think out a design for Mr. Morley’s new
toilet-soap, and I believe I've found a
winner.” Noting my surprised bewilderment,
he laughed out loudly. “Forgive me, Mr.
Wilson,” he went on in that curiously soft
voice of his, “I quite forgot we are com-
parative strangers. Didn’t Mullins tell you
anything about me?”
“Only that you are an infallible cure for
despondency. That’s the main reason I
came.”
“Mullins will have his joke—he’s always
saying that about me. Perhaps it’s because
I’ve always been such a lucky devil. The
fact is, Mr. Wilson, I’m an artist by dis-
position, and I design advertisements for a
living. As I’ve some fancy and a turn for
drawing and color, Mr. Morley showed mo
that new soap of his, and it’s been on my
mind for a week. As you probably know,
the advertising business offers wonderful
scope for invention, and it has brought me
a certain success in some quarters. Wiry,
I’ve made two or three fortunes since losing
my own. Three, and this will be the fourth.
Four fortunes made to one that’s lost. Good
Lord, what a slap in the eye for Fate!”
“Yes,” I agreeed, glancing about the room •
“but they’re not your fortunes?”
“Eh? Oh, I see, of course! Still I made
them!” He filled his pipe, and broke off
to talk of other things; and at the end
of half an hour this extraordinary man had
not only completely won me over, but was
in possession of most of my family history.
There was a probing sincerity and a tactful
sympathy in his manner that drew me on to
intimate confidences; and later, when I ex-
plained that the purpose of my trip to Maori-
land was marriage, and showed him a snap-
shot of my bride-to-be, he was all interest.
Puffing hard at his pipe, lie returned my pro-
perty without speaking, and I noticed his
one eye travel to the table where stood the
painting that had so attracted me when I
first entered the room. There was a some-
thing in his expression that made me turn
my head away. When I looked at him again,
two slow tears were making their way down
the wrinkled cheek nearest me. After a
moment he brushed them aside with his
finger, without shame or ostentation, and
turned upon me a face in which serenity
was again paramount.
“My dear boy,” he said, softly, “in ex-
change for your confidences, it is possible
you’d like to hear something of my own
life. I’m afraid you’ll find it rather drab;
but friends cannot know too much of each
other’s histories, and we are friends already,
I do believe.”
I stretched out my hand to meet his, and
with a cordial grip to ratify this understand-
ing, he began :
“There’s little to tell until I was nearly
eighteen, except that my good luck stuck
to me at school. I account myself fortu-
nate in that I was just an ordinary boy
with no special talent. The future of clever
boys is very often discounted by admiring
parents or relatives, and the lads seldom
realise many of the golden dreams they
raise. Thank Heaven, nobody ever expected
much of me! I am, and always was, an
idle fellow. It was drawing and painting
I always loved. Often, while distracted
masters vainly tried to hammer facts into
my head. I would be decorating my desk
and books with some of the fancies that
obsessed my mind. At times I feel that
the world has let me off very lightly for my
laziness.
“I had a turn at chemistry, too, and it
led to this” —pointing to the closed lid and
its tenantless socket —“the luckiest escape
I ever had, I do believe. It chanced to be
the eye that was never much good to me.
However, just before I turned eighteen, my
father died: and, although he was the last
of my blood-relations as far as I knew then,
I’m afraid I soon ceased to feel his death
as keenly as a dutiful son should. I was

Never neglect your kidneys!
Avoid that backache by taking Doan’s Pills.
\A7 EAK KIDNEYS spoil your joys, making
V V you feel old and wretched, and unfitting
you for either work or play. Why not prevent
such trouble? Middle-aged people, in particular,
should take an occasional course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills as a precaution. This helps the
kidneys to rid the blood of impurities that cause
backache, rheumatism, lumbago, sciatica, dropsi-
cal swellings and urinary disorders. In many
serious cases of kidney trouble Doan’s Pills have
proved highly successful.
SYDNEY MAN TELLS HIS STORY.
A COMPLETE RECOVERY.
ut r : Holder, 235 West Street. North Sydney, says:
‘Doans Backache Kidney Pills are indeed a wonderful
kidney medicine. I have proved this. For a long time
I suffered agony from backache and kidney trouble, and
only those who have been afflicted in this way have any
idea what I went through. My limbs swelled consider-
ably. tlie kidney secretions were thick and cloudy with a
red sediment, and I had agonising pains in my back. I
was treated by a doctor and tried all sorts of remedies,
but nothing gave me the slightest relief. I was naturally
very worried about the serious state of my health, and
when Doan s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under
my notice I decided to try them. It was a grand thing
lor me that I got this remedy, for seven bottles cured
me completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan's Pills
and recommend them with every confidence to other suf-
ferers.'’
Eight years later Mr. Holder says: “I have still the
same good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
I hey cured me of kidney disorder eight- years ago, and I
have had no return of the complaint since."

DOAN’S OINTMENT CURES PILES.
SYDNEY PEOPLE SAY SO.
Mrs. R. W i'k. 03 Eveleigh Street.
Redfern, Sydney, says : “A member of
my family suffered terribly with Pro-
truding Piles. The pain was so great
that lie could not sleep at night, and
would toss about for hours. He had been
suffering for three years, and we were
always having advice and using dif-
ferent remedies, but nothing did him
any good until we got Doan's Oint-
ment. This remedy proved excellent:
it gave complete ease. 1 cannot say
enough in praise of Doan's Ointment,
and recommend its use whenever op-
portunity offers.”
Eighteen years later Mrs. Wark
says: “I am pleased to tell you that
the member of my family who was
cured of Piles by Doan’s Ointment over
eighteen years ago is still free from
this trying complaint. This remedy is
a certain cure for Piles.”
Mr. .T. Mitchell, 26 Campbell Street,
Glebe, Sydney, says: “I w r as a sufferer
with Itching Piles for years, and 1
cannot describe the agony of this 'ail-
ment. Scores of times 1 have lost
my rest, sleep being out of the ques-
tion. i used a great many Pile reme-
dies, and was treated by a doctor, but
got no relief. Reading of cures effected
by Doan’s Ointment, 1 decided to try
it. A few applications gave' me ease,
and by continuing the treatment JL
found, to my great satisfaction, that
all the pain and irritation had gone.
1 am very grateful to Doan's Oint-
ment for my cure, and advise sufferers
to try this remedy, and am satisfied
that if they follow the directions they
will soon be cured.”
Ten years later Mrs. Mitchell says:
“My husband has been free from Itch-
ing Piles since Doan’s Ointment cured
him. but he still uses this remedy now
and then, just as a preventive
against any return of his old com-
plaint.”

KEEP A TIN ALWAYS ON HAND.
IT’S A MIGHTY FINE REMEDY.
boarding in Paddington at tlic time with
a widow who, having only one daughter, bad
more rooms than she could use, and was
glad to let ope of them to a quiet tenant
like myself. It was there that I met my
little one.” He motioned to the picture
on the table, and drew hard at his pipe.
“We were together a great deal, and it
wasn't long before all my hopes and fears
—everything—centred in her. But she re-
garded me only as a companion, and I
lived in a dream of Paradise I dared not
look into too closely.
“I couldn't hope for anything much, being
poor and devoid of prospects. Things drifted
on in this way until just before my twentieth
birthday, when there was an accident to the
old omnibus in which I was returning from
work. The driver was killed outright, poor
fellow! I escaped with a broken leg, which
was lucky, considering that I had occupied
the box-seat next the driver, and would most
certainly have shared liis fate had the vehicle
fallen the opposite way. I told you I was
lucky.
“Alice and her mother nursed me for three
months, but, in spite of everything the doc-
tors could do, that leg wouldn’t heal, and
eventually it had to go. I could not keep
my position at the bank, and 1 began to
fear the possibility of becoming a burden on
my good friends. But luck was on my side
as usual. What looked like an irreparable
misfortune was destined to bring me the
greatest happiness of my life. I forget just
how it happened, but one day Alice and I
suddenly understood each other. Her
mother was most kind, though of course
she would not consent to a formal engage-
ment until I could see my way clear to
provide for a wife. Things went on un-
changed after that, except that Alice and I
used to sit calculating how far a pound
would go in housekeeping, and all that sort
of thing. Then, about six months before I
became of age, a firm of solicitors discovered
me as next-of-kin to Silas Hope, an eccen-
tric old uncle who died intestate and left
considerable property.
“Naturally this stroke of fortune com-
pletely altered my position. Though I wasn’t
to come into the legacy until my twenty-first
birthday, I could sue for a regular engage-
ment. I did so, and the wedding was ar-
ranged for a date about seven months ahead.
It was in the earlier part of the year,
glorious weather, and Alice’s face was a
picture of happiness. Lord, how happy we
were! During the following five months of
our companionship I never saw a shadow in
her eyes. She’s been happy since, I know;
but she was happy then, too, -with me.”
Stooping forward, he knocked the ashes from
his pipe, adding in a rather dry tone for
him: “Something went wrong just here,
though. The month before I became of age
a supposedly-dead cousin resurrected himself
and claimed my uncle’s property. He got
it, too —everything!”
“You—l mean, he gave you none of it?”
I exclaimed.
“It wasn’t really mine, you see” there
was no change in his soft, contented voice.
"It was lucky I never had the use of any
of that money, under the circumstances. It
would have been no easy thing to return
to poverty again. Worse still”—he dropped
into a low’er tone—“l should have dragged
her back as well.”
“Then she gave you up?”
“I offered to give her up.” He corrected
me with a touch of dignity. “And, of course,
in justice to her daughter, the mother agreed
that it should be so.”
I looked at him. With a gently satisfied
air he was sketching something on the cover
of a book. I watched the lines grow into
the likeness of the same face—the face in
the oil-painting on the littered table. I sus-
pect lie could draw no other. In all the
advertising designs he had shown me there
was tlie same general likeness whenever he
had been called upon to use a girl’s face.
Whether they were smiling at Brown’s Bills,
gloating over Smith's Beauty Powder or
languishing at Sweetheart Soap, that shallow-
hearted little chit unconsciously sat for them
all.
“She married eventually,” he went on pre-
sently, “the cousin who got the property.
At first I almost wished it had been some-
one else, but Jack is a good fellow, and he
was able to give her the things she craved
for. They're happy now, 1 betlieve. down in
their Melbourne home. I like to think she
got the money, after all."
I listened while he rambled on, striving
to keep my eyes from that pale, cadaverous
face, that lonely leg, and that companionless
eye. There was no struggling against his
influence as he went on, speaking always
about his luck, and in glowing terms. It
was not his words themselves that held me,
but the air of conviction and victory with
which he spoke them. As we sat together
in that darkening room looking out over a
neighborhood that doesn’t always breed con-
tentment, I realised that he certainly was
the happiest and most contented man I had
ever known.
It was more than a year before I saw 7
him again. I had returned to Sydney, and
was spending a brief holiday on the ‘Moun-
tains. In the course of one of my afternoon
rambles I chanced to pass the gates of a
big sanatorium. He was seated alone, just
off the main path ; and his quick walk to
meet me brought on a fit of coughing. I was
shocked to see a bright spot of blood on
the handkerchief he withdrew from his lips.
“It’s lucky I’m coughing now,” he ex-
plained. “It means a better night for me
later on. But I’m not as bad as I seem. I’ll
be leaving here in a few weeks and going
back to Jasmine-street, if they’ll still have
me there. Some of those others”—he waved
an emaciated hand in the direction of a
little group nearer the main door —“some of
them will die, I’m afraid. They don’t think
of themselves, though. They think of the
time when their dependants will be left un-
protected.” He passed his hand hastily
across his eye, and his face lighted up with
an expression of gratitude. “Don’t think
me selfish, but I can hardly exaggerate my
happy destiny in having no such bonds.”
Business took me back to town next morn-
ing, and it was early in the following winter,
soon after the birth of my first child, that
Mullins wrote me, expressing concern in re-
gard to the old fellow. Mullins’s letters
had been returne&Jrom Jasmine-street, and
he asked me to get into touch with Hope
and ascertain how things were.
My search was a protracted one. since
none of the people I approached could tell
me where to find my man. Two .out of
every three knew him, but none of them
had seen him for weeks. It was more than
a month before I ran him to earth through
the agency of a small tradesman in Surry
Hills. What this man told me sent me post-
haste to my old friend’s lodgings, pausing
only to purchase a flask of brandy from a
neighboring hotel. I reached the place,
knocked on the door, and had time to re-
ceive a general impression of extreme poverty
before a ragged woman opened the door.
In answer to my qpger question a kind of
dull wonder expressed itself in her eyes,
and when she replied her voice was flat and
toneless —the voice of a woman unloved, un-
noticed and unfed.
"Yes, ’e’s ’ere orlriglit; but if yer ’is friend
yer should ’ave come quicker. As things is,
’e w T on’t last the night. It’s lucky yer come,
any’ow, for we’re gettin’ turned out in the
mornin’. You’ll find ’im inside. P’r’aps yer
can do something fer ’im, even if yer only
shift ’im from ’ere. ’E won’t be on yer ’ands
long, wherever yer takes ’im. Gawd, it
seems a shame fer a fine gentleman like ’im
ter die in the street like a dawg! Go in
an’ see if ’e knows yer.”
I gave her my doctor’s address and asked
her to send a taxi-cab for him at once. This
she seemed glad to do. Then I pushed wide
the door and went in.
It was a small room, almost bare of fur-
niture, and lighted by a candle. There had
been some attempt at a nre earlier in the
day, but it had died for want of fuel. The
missing panes of the window were stuffed
with rags through which the chill after-
noon wind whistled derisively. The sash
was broken, too, and w T ith a shudder I noticed
that it had been propped up with Hope’s
wooden leg. Alice’s portrait, leaning against
the wall, was the only recognisable relic
from Jasmine-street.
His eyes were closed, and though his
face was but a mere mask of skin and
bone, through it there shone a glorious
something which made it the grandest and
most moving sight I have ever seen. I
thought him gone, and knelt; but as I
touched that icy hand, his eye unclosed, he
recognised me, and the ghost of that old
radiant smile flickered across his lips. I
poured a few drops of the brandy into his
mouth, and it seemed to revive him moment-
arily. He seemed to be saying something,
and, bending low, I caught the word
“Lucky!”
“My God!” I began; but he stopped
me and spoke again.
“I am lucky!” he whispered, almost in-
audibly. “They’re—going to sell—sell us up
here to-morrow, and —oh, it’s selfish —I
know, but—but I’m—moving out —to-night.”
He seemed to doze off again. I watched
and waited. When the doctor came I put a
cautioning finger to my lips, for I hoped
he was asleep.
And so, indeed, he was.
Mullins and I went to visit Hope’s grave
some weeks later. From the inscription on
the cross which Mullins himself had placed
over it I learnt for the first time that
Hope’s baptismal name was Jeremiah.

With the Sunset.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHILE high windows .all aro blushing
At day’s ending glorified,
Near and distant sounds the rushing
Of a fierce, swift-speeding tide
Bearing homeward human flotsam,
Tired of limb and lined of brow,
It is far and far I would be
From life's fret and fever now !
Now that golden sunset fountains,
Pouring glory lavishly,
Paining richness on yon mountains,
Oh, a rover 1 would be.
Walking there, enrobed in splendor
And by loveliness enfurled,
I would quite forget the squalor
And the sorrow of the world.
While the tall cliffs’ weathered faces
(lleamed and glowed with tints of gold,
I would seek the secret places
That; 1 sought and knew of old.
There I’d stray, grey Time forgetting,
And forgetting all that grieves,
While the gracious trees would greet me
With a stirring of their leaves.
On the moss and fronded bracken,
Keeping tryst the while with peace,
I would cast the cares that blacken
' Night and day without surcease.
And thereafter, head exalted,
I would carol joyously,
Like a chained man rendered chainless,
Spirit-whole and ankle-free.
Part of all the glory yonder
Swathing slope and ridge and range,
Secret pathways I would wander
i Seeking wonders sweet and strange.
There I’d surely meet the lyre-bird
Perched upon a swaying frond,
Like some magic thing created
By a greenwood fairy’s wand.
There I’d listen to the calling
Of swift waters cold and clean,
Over mossy bastions falling,
Winding on through gullies green—
Calling, calling, singing, singing,
As they glide o’er rock and root,
With the luring of a syren
And the sweetness of a lute.
Well I know, when sunset flushes
Towering cliff's and towering trees,
How the magpies and the thrushes
Make their sweet melodies.
And if I but trod yon ranges
Where far glory falls and floats,
’Tis to them I would be list'ding,
Drinking in their luscious notes.
Beech and mountain-ash above me,
Arching fern and shc-oak tress,
I would find a friend to love me
Dowered with utter loveliness:
And that friend would be great Nature,
She that tints the distant heights
With the wonders of her palette—
Rosy hues and golden lights.
