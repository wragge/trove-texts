CLIMATIC CHANGES.
The sudden changes of temperature, so eharac-
tenstie of the season, are the cause of more in-
dividual and domestic trouble than is generally
supposed. Most of the evils which result from
these changes originate in the little-thought-of
chill ’’ with which we are all so familiar. The
only really effective remedy, and one which should
be kept at all times, and under all conditions,
handy for all members of the household, is the
•tandard favorite, St. Jacobs Oil. It can be
bought from any chemist or druggist, and carries
with it a sense of security to the possessor shared
no other remedy. It is
JUST WHAT IS WANTED,
for, whenever any article has stood the crucial
test of public use and opinion for any lengthened
period of time, and the public demand for such is
continuously sustained, you may be sure that it
fills a public need. When, in the case of that
article being a proprietary medicine, the demand
is not only steadily sustained bub continually
increasing, you may be absolutely certain that
there is some extraordinary merit in it, and in the
case of St. Jacobs Oil this is borne out by the
testimony of the press and of thousands of
reputable citizens in all parts of the civilised
world. Apropos, Messrs. Francis, Newbery, &
pons, London, one of the oldest drug houses in
Great Britain (established nearly a century and a
half), write—“We have sold St. Jacobs Oil for
years; demand continually increasing on its
extraordinary merits.”
THE DAY HAS PAST for “ poking borak ”
at the faithful, old long-winding series of
the WATERBURY Watch. Old-time Con-
servatism has gracefully acknowledged its past
errors, and now admits the WATERBURY to be
undoubtedly the VERY BEST LOW-COST
TIME REE PER ever offered to the public. The
ink of good-natured satire, as applied to the
Waterbury, has run dry, but the pen of interested
malice will run til! the crack of doom. The new
short-winding WATERBURY WATCHES are
perfect models of horological skill; while the old
Beries Waterbury—paper dial and two minutes to
wind to boot—is a more reliable timekeeper than
any of its would-be rivals, in spite of the visibly-
hard - polished - nickel - plated - extra - polished-
oylinder intestines with which some of them may
or may not be fitted to special order.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES

>
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
I and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beaiitifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

Some Little Swindles
A story of a raffle from North Queensland
—the place where all the new swindles crow. The
publican’s son in a far-distant township had a
renowned gun, which lie proposed to raffle; 25
members at £1 each. The £25 was speedily forth-
coming, but the raffle somehow hung fire. In fact,
it never eventuated at all in any public sense.
But one day a subscriber met the gaudy youth
out shooting, and asked for information. “Oh,
the raffle came off all right,” he replied airily.
Mother threw for you, you know, and I threw
for myself, and I won it.” “But, I say,” said
the subscriber, “who threw for all the other
fellows?” “Oh, mother did.” “Well, who on
earth was present at the drawing?” “Mother
? ended there, and the publican’s
offspring has the gun to this day.
* • #
A S. A. tale of a raffle ends differently.
Johnson was a selector, and being in difficulties he
took a horse to Zackstein Schwabe, the local Ger-
man auctioneer, and left it in his hands for sale.
But somehow it didn’t sell; there was no rush for
Johnson’s horse, in fact, and it remained on hand.
Then Schwabe suggested, in a strong German
accent, that the animal should be raffled, and
offered to get 30 subscribers at 10s. each.
Johnson cheerfully consented, and left the
matter in the auctioneer’s hands while he
went away to repair his fallen fortunes with a job
at fencing. When he returned he called on
Schwabe for the proceeds. “ Ze horse is up ze
road,” said the German, gloomily; “ he do not go
off. Nopody vill haf him. If I had ze horse like
him I kick mineself and go.” So Johnson led the
rejected animal home again, and proceeded to
make inquiries. Thereupon it transpired that the
raffle had come off, but the auctioneer, being the
only man present at the drawing, had thrown for
everybody and afterwards announced that he him-
self had won—and then, instead of paying the
money, had handed back the horse in full satisfac-
tion of all claims.
Johnson figured the matter out for many days
and came no nearer understanding it. But, being
still impecunious, and there being apparently less
demand for the horse than ever, he adopted a new
expedient. He had a number of cattle, and his
next neighbour, Wilkins, had sheep to about the
same value. So each of them sent his stock to
the common enemy, the auctioneer, to be disposed
of. Then Wilkins made a high bid for Johnson’s
cattle, with the proviso that the auctioneer would
take his bill at three months, and Johnson bought
Wilkins’ sheep at considerably above the market
rate on the same terras, and the German dis-
counted both bills at a stiff percentage. And
when they got home the two selectors exchanged
animals once more, so that everything—except
the bills —was back on its old footing. The story
closes with an infuriated auctioneer seizing both
lots of animals on account of two dishonoured
bills, and selling them to his own dissatisfaction
in a falling market. At latest advices Johnson’s
horse was again being raffled amid great popular
excitement, but this time that agriculturist is
conducting the proceedings in person.
“One day a prisoner was asleep in the
limehouse of St. Helena gaol, when the warder
came along and saw the leg of the somnolent one
dangling m sight. “ What are vou doing there,
man?” enquired the warder. “Doing five years,
sir," was the reply.—Ex.
The editor of a Sydney paper refused
insertion to a letter the other day, on the
ground that the correspondent had, some time
previously, written a letter to a contrary effect,
w hich recalls the action of F. W. Ward in exclud-
ing from Sydney Daily Tklkgkaph the corres-
pondence of a licensed victuallers’ secretary,
formerly a teetotal prophet, but with the difference
that the editor of the performance now noted has
himself held editorial appointments on many
antagonistically-prinoipled journals.
Thus the Pall Mall Gazette :—
There is one British institution to which the Australian
colonies cling with an admirable affeciion, and that is the
mode of despatching criminals of which Jack Ketch is
the patron saint. The circumstances must be very
extenuating indeed to admit of any condemned wretch
cheating the gallows in Australia, the most rigid adhesion
being had, w here insanity is pleaded, to the strict legal
definition which the advance in psychological science
in this country has long ago modified into something
like accord with what modern reeeaich has revealed of
the abstruse workings of the “mind diseased.” In such
high esteem are the punitive and deterrent powers of
the hangman’s rope regarded at the Antipodes that its
remedial sway is extended to cases of attempted as well
as actual murder, and to offences against women. Un-
doubtedly, in the case of the latter, drastic measures were
requisite in the early days of Australian settlement, when
the residences of the pioneers lay widely apart and
women were left in the wilderness wholly unguarded
while their natural protectors were absent for days and
perhaps weeks together tending their flocks or prospecting
for the precious metal. It was then necessary to treat these
offences with Draconian sevfrity, or otherwise there would
have been an intrusion of lynch law, which form of rude
Justice has happily never become acclimatised in Australia,
despite the convict strain which leavened the mass of its
picked immigration. The law was severe, Justice was
prompt, and there was no need for a recourse to the
impromptu tribunals of Judge Lynch, even under the
most provocative circumstances, and in the most rough
and ready times. The justifiable severity of the “early
days ” is indefensible under the regime of settled order ;
And it was with a thrill of horror that a fpw years
the world learnt that four boy* had been strung up in
Sydney for a criminal assault, which in this country
would have involved only a limited tenn of imprisonment,
eve., had a conviction been obtained on the tainted and
dubious evidence.
In the first golden days of the Palmer, a
hawker, who found himself compelled to absent
himself from his stores-tent for a whole day,
selected “Dinny” M Kenna as a trustworthy
caretaker. “Will you oblige me, Dinny?”
“Certainly Oi will, me dasint man.” "You’ll
find a bottle of grog only just opened ; help your-
self.” “ Indade Oi will,” The hawker departed.
. . . “Dan,” called Dinny to a mate, “come
and be a bit sowshal. Help yoursilf and then go
and tell the bhoys that Mr. Dennis M’Kenna is
entertaining his friends and will be glad if they
will rowl up," . . . The “ bhoys ” rolled up,
150 strong. The hawker’s stores were plentifully
stocked with cases of good brandy (grog was not
much under 20s. a bottle then) and English beer.
. . . About 3 o’clock next morning, the hawker
returned, and was astounded to find a bacchanalian
pandemonium illuminated by about three score of
his candles, and the whole camp in various stages
of picturesque drunkenness. “ Be quoiet, sorr !”
exclaimed Dinny. “This is moy entertainmint.
Don’t you see I am resaving me frinds ? We are
kaping company sowshally, and we want no
iliinent uv disturbance. Didn’t ye ax me to
moind your tint? And ain’t I moinding it?
Lave the company, sorr, or be sowshahle.” The
hawker had to let the orgy proceed. When it was
oyer, there wasn’t a thimbleful of any liquor to be
found in (lie place Even the kerosene tin had
been fmptJ-d

It is very palatable when taken internally, which places

“lam 55 years of ege, and until 1884 had al-
ways enjoyed good health. About (hat t me, a
little hard bunch, like a wart, appeared on my
lower lip. Finally, the bunch gathered, broke,
and formed a sore ; then it began to eat into the
flesh. The Cancer —for that is what the doctors
finally called it—kept getting worse and worse,
year after year. It caused me great pain and
uneasiness. Dui ing the last year, I would wake
twenty times in a night, suffering intensely
from twitching pains. It was as if my flesh
was being torn from me by pinchers, bit by bit.

At last, I began to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
In the course of a week or two I noticed a
decided improvement. The twitching and the
pains were very much less, and the sore began
to look healthier. In three months my lip
began to heal, and, after using the Sarsaparilla
for six months, the last trace of the Cancer dis-
appeared, and left very little sear.”—J. E. Nich-

Circumstantial Evidence.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ned Stringamheiner and Joe Mason had
the contract for pot-sticking the wool at Waroo
station, liar won River. They were old mates and
just finished a job of scrub-cutting, the few
pounds earned at which had been paid in one
cheque drawn in favour of Joe.
One Sunday, Ned felt ill, and said he would
draw ijl from the boss and go to Bilga Shanty
and store, several miles distant, and get a bottle
of stuff, the station store not being well stocked
with medicine.
“Don’t draw on the boss,” said Joe. “Take
the cheque. You can bring me back a flannel.”
Joe and Ned knew and trusted each other.
The woolclasser gave Ned a commission to bring
him “a bottle,” and off Ned went.
Sunday and Monday passed; no Ned ! On
Tuesday, Joe, feeling uneasy, went to the boss and
told him of Ned’s absence. The boss at once
started enquiries at the shanty. The shanty-
keeper stated that Ned had started for home on
Monday evening carrying a new flannel and a
bottle of whisky, and that he was then quite
sober.
_ Now, among the blacks on the Barwon at this
time was a nigger known as “Paroo Jack,” con-
cerning whom there was a dark legend that he
had once killed a white man, but could not be
convicted for want of evidence.
All the shearers turned out to search for tracks
of Ned Stringamheiner. The blacks’ camp was
near the river. At the camp they found Paroo
Jack in his gunyah, clad in a new flannel, with an
empty whisky-bottle and Ned’s purse in his
possession. Jack said that a whife man had met
him, given him a flannel, a bottle of whisky and a
purse to take to Waroo; that he had swallowed
the whisky and neglected the errand.
A guard was placed over Jack, and the neigh-
bourhood was hunted for tracks. These were
found on the muddy bank, leading into the river,
near where a leaning gum threw out a branch
over the water. There were no tracks returning
from the river.
“I have it,” said a man who had much know-
ledge of aboriginal customs. “Paroo Jack got
Ned drunk, took him into the river, staked him
down, as is a favourite custom with blacks, to
prevent discovery, and came back himself by
means of that branch of the gum.”
The shearers all believed this theory.
Had a white man been so accused by circum-
stances of a suspected murder, he would un-
doubtedly have been handed over to the police.
So there was much grumbling when the boss released
Paroo Jack on the ground of insufficient evidence.
Joe Mason duly finished up his contract and
depaited for fresh fields.
* # m
Two years afterwards, Joe Mason .and a
mate, having just finished and been paid off for
droving a mob of cattle Maranoa-wards, were
making for the nearest township. A horseman
coming towards them became visible,
“ If that isn’t Ned Stringamheiner I was never
on the Barwon 1” exclaimed Joe.
He was the verit; bP Ned.
He explained his disappearance very simply ;-r-
-“Joe, old man, I got drunk. I started home-
wards on the Monday all right, but I felt so
ashamed of myself for having lambed down the
whole of the cheque that when I met a black-
fellow I gave him the things to carry up to Waroo,
and I cleared out.”
“We were nearly wiping out Paroo Jack over
that little mystery,” said Joe.
This is a true story, well known to many bush-
men. The names used are, of course, fictitious.
IL PAGLIACCIO.
A drover’s yarn from the West Coast of
Tasmania tells how cattle for Zeehan were being
driven along the sea-beach, when a huge mass of
foam was encountered, collected at a creek cross-
ing, in such volume and in so compact a state,
that nine head of cattle were suffocated and
drowned in the attempt to cross the creek. A
fair lie.
During the debate on the proposed reduc-
tion in the Vic. municipal subsidy, Albert Harris,
M.L. A., solemnly asserted that the shire of Wal-
halla contained “five or six hundred thousand
square miles of territory,” and that the roads were
so bad that, in one instance, it took 21 bullocks 14
days to draw a two-ton load a distance of nine
miles. Just here a hollow voice from a back
bench offered to believe the story if Harris with-
drew one bullock. Harris withdrew one bullock
accordingly.
Charlotte Corday’s Marat assassination
was centenarised about a month ago. Many a
time the doctors have ineffectually tried her
stroke on a dead body. Apropos, years ago
the present writer saw one Rooney, a Lonsdale-
street (Melb.) shoemaker, attacked in the water by
a shark, which cut through the flesh and muscles
of his thigh, leaving the limb hanging by the bone
only, and killing the man within a minute or so.
Not one of the score of surgeons who saw his
wound could clearly theorise as to the method of
its infliction.
Dear Bulletin, —Some of your contri-
butors are running the old mirage story. No
one lint an idiot would ever think of mistaking
an Australian mirage for water, and I presume it
is pr )tty much the same all over the world. I
forget where it was I lately saw an account of
thirsty horses or cattle making for a mirage—
which is about as likely as that a hungry man
would suddenly attack the painted lobster in a
picture gallery. Of course there is the historical
blunder about Lake Torrens, but that occurred
under very peculiar conditions.—D.
At Wellington (M.L.) the other day a
deputation of females broke in upon Mrs. Bishop
Hadfield with a purse of sovereigns, and the
spokeswoman suggested, as she handed over the
money, that the bishop’s wife should buy a car-
riage with it, and that “ the names of the donors
should be painted on the panels.” Think of the
joy of that woman who goes about in a carriage
bought by public subscription with the names of
forty or fifty subscribers painted all over it
most of the subscribers being named T. Smith, or
Mrs. Jobkins, or things like that!
There is, in Maoriland, a wealthy retired
publican whose father, years ago, was the
“common hangman.” Two men were once con-:
demned to die on the same morning, and when
hanging-time arrived the executioner was found
to be seriously ill. His son, the grogseller,
was at once sent for to take his place. Ho
bounded over his bar counter, hastened to the
gaol, and without a tremble polished off the two
unfortunates. The work finished, he returned
directly to his hotel, and for the rest of the day
dispensed libations in the usual way.

Hypnotism and Crime.
According to cablegrams, Justice in,Europe is,
making a new departure. Ever since the days
uf witchcraft and people who were possessed
of an evil spirit, and the era of mental obscu-
rity when, hogs and other animals were tried
on charges of being inwardly occupied by
devils, the law has been intensely materialistic
in its tone, and has studiously ignored every-
thing which it could ignore in, the domain of
mental science. It has refused, as long as it
possibly could, to recognise any unusual con-
ditions of the mind, except the most self-
evident description of blank and utter
lunaci'. It has resolutely ignored mesmer-
ism, "hypnotism, and similar alleged things
of the unseen, world', and has, in, effect,
classed them with mahatmas, ghosts, ele-.
mentary spirits, spooks, and the other
shadowy influences which are declared, upon
no visible evidence, to sprawl through time
and space, and to move with tleshless feet in
ghostfand. Its vision has, been bounded by
the spikes in front of the dock, and it has
been materialistic simply because any diver-
gence from the old groove made it more
dilhcu.lt to get the prisoner comfortably
banged out of the road. But a stolid Dutch
court, at Amsterdam, threatens to upset this
pleasant and easy order of things, lyud in tra-
duce into criminal procedure a perplexing
element which, in the end, will probably
wreck the old, reliable banging system and
tear up the gallows by the roots.
m * •
The case at issue is, in itself, sufficiently
simple. A Dutchman named De Jong, or
words to that effect—for names seldom come
over the cable without serious mutilation
had two successive wives, both of whom are
missing. (.Tsf.Trrrvrho -hasy-caMc-wWrecs
go it would seem that several other women
are also missing.) It ii assumed that they
did nutdic iu any orthodox fashion, for their
burial places cannot be traced - ; neither* do
heir deaths appear, so far as is known, on
any register. They have vanished olf the
earth, and their husband, apparently,
declines to furnish any information con-
cerning them, and no trace can be found
large enough to himg a tale upon, or a theory
—or even a Dutchman. Without some trace
De Jong cannot be satisfactorily asphyxiated,
and modern law doesir t allow of the requisite
information being extracted by torture/’ So
it is seriously proposed 'to hypnotise the
wretched Dutchman, and to extract from
him, while under the hypnotic influence*
the story of the supposed tragedy. His own
confession, obtained under spch circum-
stances, will not be evidence, for a hypno-
tised subject can to give any testi-
mony the operator desires, and everything
thus depends on the honesty of the hypilo
tist, whose integrity is more likely to be
below than above the average. But if the
experiment is a success De Jong may be
made to reveal the burial-places of his
two lost wives* and when they are dug up
their remains may supply the information
required to ensure his own Conviction. It
has been decided that there is no law to
prevent him hanging himself in this manner,
so the experiment will probably take its
course.
« • •
Then, if the attempt comes out all
right, the old, comfortable days, when the
law measured a suspect with a two-foot rule
and hanged him by rote, will presently be
/one for ever. When it begins to use hyp-
notism as a means for the discovery of crime
it must necessarily admit that hypnotism is
a truth and a reality. When it demonstrates
that a certain criminal can be, under hypno-
tic influences, made to commit the suicidal
act of confessing his crime and its circum-
stances, then it demonstrates at the same
time that he may have been made to commit
the crime by exactly the same influence.
And when it once gets to this stage, all the
joy and satisfaction of hanging the offender
will have vanished. The man whose will
can be completely subjected to that of
another is not a free agent, and is liable to
commit any crime while Under the domina-
tion of a more powerful intellect. But
hypnotism, unfortunately for the police
intelligence, leaves no big footprint under a
dead man’s window, nor any gory finger-
marks upon his wall, and for want of these
indications it will be practically impossible,
in the great majority of cases, to say
whether it has been at work or not.
So long as the law ignored all so-
called occult powers it could hang the
person by whom the crime was committed,
or was supposed to bo committed, with a
light heart, and refuse to consider the
possible responsibility of any individual save
the visible criminal. But when once it
begins to employ these powers for its own
purposes, then it can tacitly deny their
existence no longer, and after that the
gallows is standing on a quicksand. If it is
necessary to prove, not only that a certain
person committed a crime, but that he did
not do it under any invisible soul-influence,
or through any unconscious mental pressure
whatever, then the whole judicial system
must go sliding downhill together.
# * #
It is quite possible that, in course of time,
the human race will be definitely divided
into two classes --- hypnotic subjects and
hypnotists. Then the law must recognise
the obvious fact that no person possessing
the hypnotic power will, openly or directly,
commit murder, for he will almost always be
able to compel some other person to do it
for him. And, on the other hand, when a
crime is committed by a hypnotic subject,
there will always be a possible assumption
that. it was done at the instigation of
another individual, who is practically uu-
tindable, and who is likely to. remain
so until a time comes when a human
being can be placed under the influence of
chloroform, and his soul put under the-
microscope. Therefore, when the law once
begins to take cognisance of anythingmvhich
doesn’t leave a measurable footprint under
the window, or a visible bloodstain on the
floor, it is lost. Far all the world in general
knows to the contrary this state of things
may be already far developed, only hitherto
the criminal code has not worried about any-
thing beyond (be material aspect of things.
In all probability it frequently Icings the
wrong man—-the unconscious victim of mes-
meric influence, but so long as it declines to
admit that he may be the wrong man, it is
perfectly content.
* # »
The days when the criminal code worked
most smoothly were those of its primitive
ignorance. In that pleasant long ago, when
evidence was wanting and some bulky and
illiterate official in a . coat of mail could find
no satisfactory clue, the nearest “ suspect,”
or, if there was no suspect, then, the first
unimportant individual who came to hand,
was required to toss up with Providence,
and if he lost the toss then his guilt was
sufficiently demonstrated. So long as "Qi.q
human race had entire faith in judgment by
ordeal it was content, and the course of
justice- went with an even flow. By-and-
bye, however, it lost its old reliance upon the
judgment of Providence, and then, it took to.
other devices. If there was an insufficiency
of evidence it made the accused swallow two
quarts -of water-do cuuqiL-l_hiju—to- Capfuss-
and if that failed it made him swallow two
quarts more, and then if Up,didn’t confess
and didn't burst It usually executed him on
general principles. So,far as .is known, the
people of that period were reasonably satisfied
with this mode of administering justice also.
When it, too, became out of date, the law
began to rely solely on evidence, with a
blissful faith in police testimony and in the
infallibility of 12 dull-witted men in a jury-
box. And now it is slowly dawning on tlie
public intelligence that police testimony is
not much better than, and often not so good
as, any other variety, and that juries tire
deaf and ignorant and often go to sleep
in the box T and even facts are not always
what they Seem, and that there may
be more things in time and eternity
that! even a loud-mouthed police-court
attorney is fully aware of. Even the defence
of GAbrielle Bombard, the Parisian mur-
deress, who claimed that she assisted in the
strangulation of a bailiff under an irresistible
hypnotic influence, seems no longer so abso-
lutely incredible as it did a very few years
ago; When once the law loses hold of its
Old complacent ignorance, and acknowledges
that seven grocers and five cheesemongers,
sworn to return a verdict according to the
evidence, do not necessarily know every-
thing in heaven, above, and in the earth
beneath, and in the dog-star which is betwceli
the heavens and the earth—then pretty
nearly anything becomes possible.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Insufficient “Cat.”
It was bound to come. The Australian Star,
which for a long while was a consistent and
vigorous advocate of the lash as a remedy for
every evil, now discovers that, though the “cat”
is in vigorous operation in New South Wales
and Victoria, no good result is visible.
Therefore, it rises to point out that the cat has
failed, not because it is a horrible and revolting
instrument of torture, but only because it isn’t
horrible enough. In its own elegant language :
It is significant that the flogging provisions of the
criminal laws, under which assaults of this class come,
have apparently done little to put down this branch of
ruffianism. The lash alone, it is evident, does not possess
the necessary repressive influence. . . . We have no
intention of implying that the lash has broken down as a
means of repressing the foul weed of larrikinism
Great Heavens, no ! Blasphemy wouldn’t be a
patch upon that awful desecration—
—only that it requires to be strengthened by other
penalties. ... If offences for which the lash is pre-
scribed still show an increase, and criminals who have
suffered a flogging sentence continue to pursue their law-
less career, the inference is plain that the tenors of the
lash must be reinforced.
In other words, something still more terrible
must be added to it. The Bulletin therefore
offers a few suggestions. -Scalping, for instance,
might he beneficial. The hair never grows
again on a scalped patient, and his bare, bright-
red, scalded-looking cranium would be a warn-
ing and an example as long as he lived.
Then there is the Tartar iniquity of cut-
ting a man in two just below the waist, ■
and instantly putting the upper end of him on
a red-hot sheet of iron. This stops the How of
blood, and the frizzled half-man would some-
times live for minutes. The mediaeval French
idea of breaking the criminal’s legs and then
putting him into a sack with six cats and drop-
ping the whole lot in the river had som-e advan-
tages so had the English system of piling five
or six paving-stones on his abdomen and leaving
him to die—in three days or so—of general
squashing of the system and there is some-
thing to be said for the Chinese device of keep-
ing a prisoner awake till he dies. Another idea
which might commend itself to the Star is the
Oriental punishment of impalement—an im-
paled larrikin in Pitt-street, Sydney, near the
door of the Star office, would probably lead to
a large-increase of the circulation. The Dutch
inspiration of keeping a prisoner entirely
without salt, whereby he became, a carious
study in worms, might do a lot to put down
larrikinism ; or the lash might be “reinforced ’”
by plain crucifixion, also by the rack, and the
thumbscrew, and the boot, and the beautiful
old Persian punishment of “the ashes”—
whereby the prisoner was put in a closed room
with a layer of ashes a foot deep on the iloor,
and then a big wheel began to revolve and stir
them up very gradually until he suffocated. If
“ tlie ashes” wouldn’t sufficiently “ reinforce ”
the lash, it is difficult to say what would.
Possibly the Indian device of biting off the
finger-nails might strike the Star favourably,
or the Moorish policy of breaking the ankle-
bones. As the bones heal the feet generally
grow inwards till the toes of one foot point
straight at those of the other, and
when the police met a man with his
feet in that curious shape they could always
arrest him on suspicion—because he couldn’t
run fast enough to get away. If the Star
wants to have the lash reinforced with other
“ terrors,” it can take its choice among all
these—and a lot more—without any extra
charge. They are all the same price. Or, if it
likes, it can have the lot at a great reduction,
as this paper is clearing out its stock of old
horrors, regardless of cost. Also, some in-
genious Indian ideas in burning pines plinters
can be obtained on application; and an old
Carthaginian device of cutting off tlie eye-lids
and then tying up, tlie patient with his face
turned straight to the sun ; and dodge
which consisted in breakiifg tlie legs of an
offender with an iron bar and then leaving him
on an ash-heap; and a Moorish invention
„w here by he was thrown up in the air a certain
number of times and took his chance in coming
down again; and various other sundries. Among
the sundries is a certain scheme, vagltoly ascribed
lo an Emir of Bokhara, who Hayed bis'enemy’s
wife alive in the enemy’s presence', and •then
put oat his eyes, so that he might have nothing
to do all the rest of Ids life but think of that.
-tiiwFwpeefweler- T-Wpe-uro-plenty of-methdds to-
choose from, and they are all of a kind which
any “right-thinking pqrsou ” ought to approve
of, and if they wouldn’t suppress larrikinism—
well, .perhaps they could also jt>e “,;reinforced ”

The Vanishing - Capitalis'.
The Bulletin’s old friend, George Pun:, writes
in the B.M. Herald about the withdrawal of
“ English capital ” :
At the time of the Broken Hill strike I pointed out thnt
the inevitable result of the labour disturbances which
were such frierhful frequency w ould be that
EngUsh capital would he w ithdrawn from I hose shores ami
invested in those countries which were not curs <1 with
trades unions. ...My contention was demurred to at th<*
tipio, hut it has proved to lie quite true, as English capital
haH been withdrawn from these colonics, and, as a conse-
quence, there is very little cinplojmcnt for our people,
and so wages have fallen in many easts to less than one-
half of the rates which were prevailing in these colonies
but three or four years ago, \
Then Mr. Pile points out that “ English
capital ” is now going to Asia—much of it to
Siam ; that Siam is booming and is overrun
with Chinamen as i\he blessed result of English
capital ; and that English capital has quitted
Australia, apparently for ever. Therefore,
The Bulletin asks once more a very old
question which G. Pile, and other Tories of
his kind never seem to answer : When did that
capital go ? Also, in what form did it go,
and who saw it going ?< It didn’t depart in the
shape of gold or silver, foiMhere have been even
less exports of these than usual, and the lands
and houses and banks and mines weren’t Lorn-
up by the roots and removed to Hingland, and
the amount of money in the country keeps on
increasing at about the usual rate,, and-.the
various Governments keep on borrowing with
about the usual amount of success, and the
British bank deposits haven’t been removed
because the banks have gone on strike and
won’t pay, and nobody, so far as The
Bull etin is aware, has seen any British
capital whatever leaving the country. Conse-
quently, The Bulletin asks George Pile fo
refrain from aimless generalities, and unde-
fined jaw - workings, and claptrap, and
maunderings that have no visible means of
support, and to cease talking through his hat;
and to explain as briefly as possible what
British capital has departed, what part of Aus-
tralia it departed from, the date of its exit, the
name of some sane and reliable citizen who can
take an affidavit before a Justice of the Peace
that he saw it go, the address of the vacant
place where it used to be, and some particulars
about the industry which lias burst through its
evauishment, together with some reasonably
reliable evidence that it was trades-unionism
and not bank-repudiation which scared it away.
For without this evidence Mr. Pile’s bald asser-
tion that English capital has been withdrawn—
it is a great pity that it wasn’t withdrawn, by
the way—is just as convincing as anybody else’s
assertion that people don’t get their heads
shampooed in Jupiter.

When is a Cxfima not a Crime?
The Victorian police authorities have calmly
and definitely intimated that they .don’t care a
rap about the celebrated abduction of Clara
Parker, The Law, on a certain noto-
rious occasion, committed Clara to tlie charge
of tlie authorities aforesaid, whereupon
the lady was bailed out in a dark, mys-
terious manner, and spirited away until such
time as she came knocking at the prison door,
with a demand to he re-incarcerated. Then
the police authorities took Clara back again
and presented her for trial. The result of tiic
trial made it evident that Clara had been
wrongfully locked up in the first instance, and
still more wrongfully abstracted from custody.
Also a stout, baldheaded brother of a baronet
was cast in heavy damages for accusing Clara
of the crime she didn’t commit. There the
matter rested awhile. The estimable Vic-
torian Crown never = dreamed of indicting
anybody on a charge of the deadliest, or
nearly the deadliest, variety of perjury
under Heaven. It. was. nothing to Jus-
tice that a woman’s liberty had been nearly
sworn away, for a long period by. a fuddled fat
man. Neither was it anything to the police
authorities that this woman had been “ faked ”
out of the Law’s arms. These things
had taken place in Victoria, where the preju-
dices of old-fashioned civilisation may oftimes
be danced upon with impunity. Two- dr three
weeks ago, however,, Clara Parker made the
police a present of her alleged abductor, and
the police had to- bring this unwelcome gift up
to Court, It was a droll arrest. The attempt
on Clara’s part to vindicate the majesty of the
Law was seemingly made with no very malignant
intention towards the person against whom she
swore her information. But that was a matter
of no importance to the main point. There
stood the alleged abductor of Clara waiting to-
be prosecuted for “ intent to prevent the due-
course of justice.” Clara had handed him over
to the Victorian Constitution, so to speak, a»dl
he was professedly willing to make a clean
breast of it. Clara pleaded, in forma pmiperi a,
that she couldn’t conduct a prosecution at her
own expense, and Panton, P.M., adjourned
tlie case for a week “'to see- if the police would
take it up.’” The police didn’t take it up. The
authorities declined to interfere in the matter.
Clara was von e*f, and the person who ab-
stracted Clara was discharged from custody.
Judicial decency be damned !
o
Beaks of Melbourne.
In the Victorian Assembly, lately, member
Murray, of Warrnambool, gave tongue to
popular sentiment on the subject of Mel bourne’s
honorary magistrates. “It would be a good
thing for the. administration of justice,” said
Mr. Murray, “,if a number of the justices of
the metropolitan district never sat upon the
Bench.” Thereat Zox rose, in all the purity of
his white waistcoat, to- object to the casting of
reflections upon these great and good men, and
Murray further expressed popular opinion by
replying. that personal friends of “dear old
Zb-X ” were included among the lawgivers who
brought the administration of justice into con-
tempt. As member for East Melbourne, the
Hebrew punster would naturally speak up for
local beakdom, more particularly us he couldn’t
ilony . a personal ..iumuain.tauce with many
of them. No other voice, however, was
raised in protest against Murray’s asser-
tion, and the ghastly silence of the Assembly
signified a discreditable dread of touching
a foifl ! public scrindal. For some time past


a system of packing has prevailed* on the
metropolitan police-court benches. There may
be live or ten Christians to every Hebrew on
the magisterial roll, yet the average Bench,
hears a preponderance of Chosen People. Some-
times there are three Jews to one Christian
dispensing justice in court, whilst the desire
of Abraham, Lazarus to sit in judgment on
Lazarus-Abraham, or his relatives and friends,
is specially remarkable. Hebrew lawyers
; flourish unduly on the strength of Jewish
“beaks,” and the Christian suitor who foolishly
' engages a Christian counsel to plead his cause
, in, say, a small debt case, may too frequently
consider himself quashed. That this scandal
should have existed a long time without
being “ mentioned in the papers ” is merely
owing to the fact that the world in general
knows little or nothing of police-courts. Only
those people whose business it is to study the
constitution of benches have any idea of the
extent to which benches are packed, or any
notions concerning the characters of some of
the men who pack them. Melbourne just now
abounds in honorary magistrates of ill repute.
Some of them are not above being anointed
with palm-oil, whilst others are only negatively
“cronk.” To know aught of these justices in
their private business relations is to be aware
that they are unfit to adjudicate upon a dog-
fight. There are many honourable exceptions,
. Hebrew and otherwise, but seeing that the
unpaid magistracy as a whole is held in con-
tempt, it is unfortunate for the honest Hebrew
justices that their race provides a considerable
proportion of the food for scorn.

Andrew Lyell, accountant, has supplied the
former manager and present liquidator of the
Federal Bank with a report on the alleged reck-
lessness of the Bank’s dealings with its directors
and their financial friends. Mr. Lyell’s
report is vaguely to the effect that nobody was
to blame for the advances (amounting to more
than a million sterling) made upon securities
which turned out to be little or no security at
all. He finds himself “unable in 1893 to ex-
press any absolute opinion as to whether at the
time they were made the directors and
managers exercised due care and caution in
making them”—but he remarks that the
securities advanced upon were “apparently
sufficient to cover ”at the time. For instance,
in January, 1889, “ when the advances made to
the Real Estate Bank stood at £02,700 the
securities then held—which consisted wholly of
titles to freehold properties—were valued at
£79,150, and further securities were lodged
from time to time as the advances increased.”
Mr. Lyell doesn’t perceive any certain want of
care or caution in the granting of a further
£50,000 to Munro’s Real Estate Bank after
the Federal had stuck itself with so much
unsaleable land at enthusiastic valuations.
Nor does he discover evidence of rashness
in the Federal’s advance of £30,000 to the
Union Finance Co., in 1891, “mainly upon the
security of the company having an uncalled
capital of £102,500.” In fact, it may be said
of Mr. Lyell’s report, and of all other such
reports issued by not unfriendly financial
“ experts,” that they regard the land-boom as
having been a teal condition of things “at the
time,” and dodge the responsibility of fixing a
date when paper values ceased to bo strictly
honest tenders.
Some queer proceedings characterised the official
opening at Banbury (W.A.) of the Pertli-Bun-
bury railway last month. A “ public” meeting
hid appointed a “ public ” committee to carry
oat a “public” demonstration on the day of
joy. Ttie Government gave this “public”
committee ,£5O of “ public money to spend ;
the contractor added another £5O. The “ pub-
lic ” committee spent £4O of this £lOO in cham-
pagne for “ distinguished guests.” This might
have been acquiesced in by the “ common
public” had the rest of the Show been open to
promiscuous patronage, since it might have
been debited to the contractor’s donation. But
the “public” committee paid “public ” money
to erect a ring fence, which was surrounded
by a cordon of police, in order to keep
out the “common public.” Admission inside
this ring fence was possible to anybody who
paid half-a-crown ! Nine tickets only were
sold ; yet the enclosure was filled with dead-
head males and females—appurtenances of the
forceful Fat- Man. What the “common
public ” was expected to do was to cheer wildly
when Gov. Bill Robinson and Premier John
Forrest appeared and were presented with
addresses. But these “ distinguished visitors ”
alighted at the Bunbury railway-station, amid
the frozen indifference of a few listless specta-
tors, and, at the ring-fence enclosure, were
honoured with a faint, squeaky effort confined
to the swelling deadheads. Even Gov. Robin-
son noticed it, and feelingly attempted a repri-
mand by a reference to the virtue of “loyalty
to the Queen’s representative.”
New South Wales Speaker Abbott refused to
accept from Samson Haynes notice of a motion
that “ the use of the thumbscrew or the rack,
as a means of torture, is preferable to the use
°f the lash.” The motto of the New South
Wales Parliament is : “ Assume a virtue if you
have it not.” Haynes’ motion was absolutely
logical and far more reasonable than most par-
liamentary proceedings. The law of Australia
distinctly enjoins torture as a punishment,
legislators for the black-coat brigade (for
m> black-coated person is, ever has been,
°r ever will be flogged) approve, with
emphatic solemnity, of that legalised barbarity.
Haynes merely stirred up the epicureanism of
legislative savagery. The man who endorses
back-skinning and draws the line at thumb-
screws is guilty of a false syllogism ; he is
a mere blundering novice, with all the
will, but little of the ingenuity, of
brutality. Speaker Abbott merely pandered
to hidebound ignorance, that is too ignorant
bveu to know and confess its own existence,
when he refused to receive Haynes’ proposed
picturesque refinements of the existing law of
torture. Once admit the right of the State to
torture, and the methods of torture become
matters of mere detail. The illogical savagery
is the principle involved. The pdvocates of
the lash argpe that bloodthirstiness is a right
arid a necessary principle. In the same breath
they will argue that the aim of the law is
justice and not vengeance. One or the other
of these arguments cannot stand. Even the
advocates of the lash know in their hearts which
is the false, hypocritical and utterly untenable
argument on any sound basis of cither justice
or expediency. Haynes should give notice of
motion to disagree with Speaker Abbott’s
ruling. He will find plenty of members to
support him in enforcing his reduclio ad
abstirdum.
•
Last week the New South Wales Assembly, by
29 votes against 11, decided to censure the
Imperial Government or whoever else might
be concerned for sending the war-vessel
Katoomba to Samoa during some of the recent
troubles in that unrestful region. The com-
plaint—which was drafted by Samson Haynes
—was practically to the effect that the
Katoomba was a vessel of the so-called Aus-
tralian naval squadron, that it was maintained
by Australian money for purposes of local
defence, and that it was never intended to be sent
to remote archipelagoes without the authority
of the Australian Governments, there to look
after British interests and muddle in Polynesian
broils on Britain’s account. In passing this vote
of censure the New South Wales Assembly acted
most foolishly. When that province passed the
Naval Defence Bill, it agreed to help in main-
taining a fleet which would be commanded by a
British admiral, the said admiral to take his
orders from England, and to do just as he liked
anywhere within the limits of the Australian
naval station. He cannot go outside that
station without the authority of the local Par-
liaments, but inside it he can do anything he
pleases, subject only to orders from “Home,”
and Australia has, practically, no control over
him whatsoever. If he gets instructions to
bombard Sydney, this country has to pay his
salary ail the same. The Australian station is
tolerably extensive, and as Samoa is within its
limits the British admiral is entitled, by New
South Wales law, to take the Australian fleet
there and massacre Polynesians with it, if his
British masters feel so inclined, without asking
anybody’s permission. Therefore, the only
thing the Cornstalk Parliament has any reason
to censure is itself, for ratifying a noxious
agreement for which there is now no legal
remedy.
An “Australian Reciter,”
In deference to repeated solicitations, The Bulletin
proposes to issue a volume of Readings and Recitations,
consisting entirely of prose and verse which originally
appeared in this paper. The Editor will feel obliged fl-
atly suggestions as to selections deemed by readers suit-
able for incorporation in a work of the kind, and it will
facilitate matters if, whenever possible, each adviser gives
the date of the issue in which the item appeared. Special
consideration should bo given, in selecting specimens, to
their elocutionary possiliilities.
Mr. T. Roydhouse, of Sydney D.T., has
become editor of Sydney Sunday Times, and his
place on the D.T, staff is now filled by Mr.

Ridsdale, the late manager of the Sunday Times,
will shortly take the field with a new literary
venture.
The Australasian Rights Purchase Bill—
enabling a gang with a Melbourne backbone to
grab the valuable Colo-Valley water-power—is
described as “another triumph for Mr. Dowel,
whose energy and pertinacity in forcing past the
N.S.W. Lower House Bills of a private character
are almost phenomenal.” Air. Dowel has great
energy and pertinacity, no doubt, but, fortunately
for the community, the private Bills for which he
barracks don’t always succeed. The Bill to in-
corporate the Australian Banking Co., for instance.
Melbourne Punch, organ of the silent
M'Kinley, M.P., remarks that “ £1 or 255. a
week is certainly not princely pay for. a pick-
and-shovel hand, but young men without oncum-
b ances can afford to work at the price, and are
grad to do so during the bad times.” Quito so.
Alnd then middle-aged men with, say, a wife and
three children apiece, have to take the same rate,
else the young men without encumbrances will
get the work and they will be left out. And
when a man with four encumbrances is working,
and presumably existing, on 20s. or 255. a week,
then some Conservative paper always rises to
point to this fact as a proof that the young man,
with no responsibilities can afford to take the job
at 15s.
Adelaide Voice :
Every intelligent single-taxer takes as the basis of his
doctrine that the land values created yearly by the com-
munity belong to the community. He therefore wants
to stop the constant appropriation of these values, and
the traffic in them which land ownership so-called and
land speculation involve. ... It is quite possible for
a man to advocate this view, and yet to advocate other
forms of taxation.
That is quite The Bulletin’s view, but it isn’t
the Single-tax party’s view. Nor is it Henry
George’s view. The Single-taxers don’t appeartobe
content that the State should annex all future un-
earned land-value increment, besides imposing a
fair, non-confiscatory tax on present unimproved
values. They want also to collar past unearned
values —just as if a land-owner who had bought
and paid consideration, openly and honestly as
the world goes, were merely on a par with the
man who had bought a stolen horse from the
thief.
From the Argus “ To-day the relation
between Great Britain and the colonies is the
family relation. But families grow up; the
mother, however she may be beloved, ceases to be
the governing and controlling power, and either a
family partnership must be established or the sons
disperse the wide world over. Is it to be plain
John Bull in the future, or John Bull and Sons ?”
In the meantime, The Bulletin would like to
have this long-standing confusion of metaphor
cleared up. Is Hingland a man or a woman ?
Does our beloved mother wear top-boots, mutton-
chop whiskers, and a capacious waistaoat, or is
John Bull an elegant female in a steel helmet!
One, at least, of the Victorian newspapers
has easily digested the fact that Victorian credit
abroad is lower than that of some other Australa-
sian States. The little Herald, although its'
“ self-respect is wounded ” by the present state of
the almighty money-market, remarks that the
price of Victorian stocks is “ a reflection on the
intelligence of English investors,” This, from the
rag adherent of Matthew Davies, is real gall. The
Mercantile Bank scandal, assisted by half-a-dozen
other bank scandals of less import, lias given
Victoria its bad financial smell, and the country
can make up its mind to lose a few millions in
high rates of interest through its indifference to
false balance-sheets, and general want of deter-
initiation to make its “Crown” respected. The
British investor lias had his dull ey T e on the disre-
■ putable course of events for some time past, lie
lias begun to ask his broker what he thinks of
Melbourne, and that financial adviser replies,
with considerable warmth, that the Queen City of
the South is a hideously bad rgg. Which is rather
a wise reflection on intelligence to hand.

•Port Elizabeth (Cape Colony) Telegraph
warns Australians, especially clerks, but also
mechanics and labourers, that “for each vacancy
which occurs in a local merchant’s office there are
at least 20 applicants.” Johannesburg is overdone,
and situations are as scarce there as anywhere,
Maslionaland may,- in the near future, absorb a
large European population, but just now its pro-
spects are not such as to tempt clerks to enter it.
There is more hope, perhaps, for mechanics and
artizans. The earth has no recognised habitat for
the clerk.
There is already talk in some quarters of
another Coalition Ministry in Victoria. Under
the system of Party Government coalitions are
occasionally inevitable; Party Government is a
“ drunk,” and coalition is the swelled head which
ensues after a more violent drunk than usual. The
one principle of party politics is that there must
be two factions in the House, and that each exists
to prove that whatever the other one does is
corrupt, and whatever it says is a lie, and that
the other faction in the aggregate is a scoundrel
of the worst description. And the principle of
coalition is that both factions remain as bad as
they were before, only they agree to say no more
about it. Then they enter a nolle-prosequi against
each other, and anyone who objects is called a
miserable hound, or words to that effect.

The long - postponed scramble for the
ownership of Morocco ought soon to begin in
earnest. Britain, France, and Spain all want to
take over the crumbling empire. Italy also wants
it, but her chance doesn’t amount to much, and
the other three practically ignore her. Spain,
however, has now got a valuable grievance against
the Moors, which ought to put her a little ahead
of her two competitors. She holds a patch or
two of Moorish territory, and the local Home
Rulers, 5000 strong, have raided her little colony
with matchlocks, and driven out an infinitesimal
outlying garrison, apparently after a murderous
conflict. Now, according to all etiquette, Spain
is bound to send over an army to trample down
every vegetable in Morocco, in order to avenge
this insult, and when she is once there she ought,
with reasonable diplomacy, to find an excuse for
remaining. The trouble is that sometimes the
other party will insist on apologising and paying
compensation, and many a most valuable griev-
ance has been wrecked that way ere annexation
could begin.
The Australasian argues that criminals
who attempt indiscriminate slaughter by throw-
ing bombs among a crowd or by obstructing rail-
way trains should, even where no life has been
taken, be made liable to capital punishment. It
points out that the absence of fatal consequences
is not the merit of the criminal, and contends that
if this view of the matter were generally estab-.
lished anarchists and their like would be deterred.
But such is actually the present law of N.S.W.
The Stephen-Docker code makes liable to capital
punishment those who perpetrate wilfully or care-
lessly any act whereby life may be lost, whether ifc
really is lost or not; and N.S.W. enjoys no
greater immunity from outrages than any other
country.
The three candidates for the Benallar
Yarrawonga (Vic.) seat were almost equally dread-
ful. Kennedy, the only Protectionist of the trio,
opposed any cutting down of the municipal
subsidy, but favoured a reduction of members’
salaries to <£2so a year. Victoria doesn’t require
that kind of patriot with his noble self-sacrifice of
£1 a week. A House composed of twenty care-
fully-chosen and carefully-watched members at
£l5OO a year apiece, each member to be the prac-
tical working head of a department, and the whole
forming a special committee on everything— that’s
about the size of Australian State requirements.
When the country couldn’t afford to pay a good
legislator a substantial salary, it would bo time to
close the ’Ouse and start anarchy.
Dear Bulletin, — I have an idea that an
expert logician could irrefutably maintain this
argument (the fear of denied space alone deters
me from attempting the feat): The laws of a
country should not apply to any citizen, moving
in alleged liberty of person, who is deprived, by
one of those laws and not by bis own negligence,
of his Parliamentary vote. Such a disfranchised
person, if this be so, should not be legally punish-
able for any breach of any law. How would this
suit the Fat Man ? Will you invite objections to
this theorem’—Yours, Gi.
Henry Wrixon, the typical red-tape Tory
(he calls himself “Liberal,” like B. R. Wise) of
the Vic. Assembly, declares that the few members
who attack the military system in time of peace
will be fonemost in shrieking for more Imperial
officers when another war-scare arrives. Wrixon
quotes, in this connection, Jingo verses by the
East India-bred Rudyard Kipling. He might as
well quote from the Emperor of Germany’s
speeches to his lamentable army, or the Czar’s
addresses to his unhappy “children” in uniform.
A. possible invasion of Australia by a European
power is merely the fiction of Wrixonism, and
the invention of the capitalist who wants
bayonets at his back for the “proper protection ”
of his precious property. Had Kipling’s youth
been spAnt way back in Australia his ditties
would have breathed scorn for the men who tried
to gull his country with war-scare fallacies, and
doubtless bo would have cursed the local Tommy
Atkins in a set of spirited verses.
It’s toinmyrot, it’s tommyrot these soger-clodgers sing,
But it’s Mr. Atkins go to not. when Democrat is king.

and secure to itself all future unearned land-value incre-
ment would be fair; for the State to make land-owners
contribute substantially, and on a progressive wealth-
scale, to the revenue would also be fair. But for the State
to punish Smith, who has paid, say, £lOOO for his piece of
land, by confiscating the annual interest on that invested
£lOOO (in other words, by making him pay full rent for his
own land), while allowing Johnson (who simply leases a
piece of State land worth £lOOO, and has never invested
a cent in land, but lends his cash out at 60 per cent. fr< m

have the equally crooked-minded liquor-prohibitionists.

be the value of the nine million* of A.M,P. mortgages?,,...

“Dorothy” still frolicking at Sydney
Lyceum last Saturday seemed rather improved in
flavour after seven days. For one thing, every-
. body wasn’t merely gaping at Nellie Stewart, who
■ acted more easily without a battery of opera-
glasses on her, and sang like a bird in a biish.
liyiey infused a freshness into “Dorothy ” by
warbling that eminently demoralising ballad,
“ Queen of My Heart ” (cut out on ttie premiere),
in the second act in his usual twopenny-coloured
style. The stage sentiment of the Byronic bari-
tone is a good deal more convincing vocally than
verbally. lie is apt to wiuk at somebody in the
wings when a damsel flies into his embrace In
cold prose and according to business, and it quite
spoils the flavour of the hug for the people in
front. A lover who winks one eye over his
darling’s golden head as she crumples up on his
coat collar seems to infer that the trusting maiden
won’t get damages out of him. The “Mikado,”
with Amy Leyton rainbow-dancing, is announced
for Saturday.
* m * m
The other Sydney shows are keeping alive,
as before, but nothing new has arisen on the
horizon. At the Royal, “ Meg ” pursues, in two
burst boots, the uneven tenor of her way, and
The Bulletin's objection to the absurd uncle
with the coffee-stall still remains in force. On
Saturday, however, there will be a change, and
“The Year ’49” is announced. It is described as
a “greatcomedy drama/’ and though the writer’s
present recollections of it are somewhat hazy, it is
bound to be an improvement on “Meg.” The
Criterion closed on Friday night after a severe
attack of “ Hamlet ” and another fleeting glimpse
of Jock Howieson, and it remains more or less
shut up to date.
mm mm
Next Saturday Mr. Ilignold proposes to
put up at Sydney Majesty’s "the only authorised
dramatisation ” of Fergus Hume’s awful “Han-
som Cab.” As it is further avmounced that this
deed will be perpetrated “for the first time in
Australia,” it dawns upon The Bulletin that
every “ Hansom Cab ” it has seen and cursed in
the past has been unauthorised and bogus and
probably wasn’t a hansom at all, but a mere four-
wheeler. This fact probably accounts for its
exceeding badness, and therefore The Bulletin
suspends judgment upon Fergus’s vehicle until
next week.

To-night (Thursday), a benefit performance
will be given at Sydney Criterion in aid of that
deserving charity, the Thirlmere Home for
Consumptives. Mr. Walter Bentley and his
company, with Captain Rupert Leigh to bear
a hand in the afterpiece, give their services free;
ihe theatre is provided by Mr. Hill, and the pro-
grammes are supplied gratis by Mr. Leveson, so
that the proceeds will go, almost without deduc-
tion, to the good cause. Also, Governor and
Lady Duff intend to be present or die in the
attempt, and under all these circumstances the
Criterion this evening ought to be an aggravated
case of overcrowding.

The “ Crystal Maze,” at the Strand,
Sydney, is an enlarged and improved edition of
the old Melbourne “Garden of Eden.” It is a
small section of Paradise which was grabbed at by
a falling angel and came away in its claws as it
fell. The illusion is made up by an elaborate
arrangement of mirrors with foliage in between,
which create an idea of illimitable distances,
and long stretches of grassy loveliness, and
patches of bright green wuodland.
m m m m
The, Mrs. Palmer-Armes Beaumont concert
tour has a touch of pathos in it. Bank-failures
have robbed old public favourites of their earn-
ings— their “bumper benefits ” have gone to
benefit the men who got overdrafts —and most of
them are worse off than when they started to
make their names. Fortunately the names of the
P.-B. combination are all good ones to conjure
with, and the trip to Maorilaud is likely to
succeed as it deserves.
m m m m
“ Cavalleria Rusticana ” having but two
more nights to go at Melbourne Princess’, the
rush to hear the last of Mascagni’s great little
opera is bound to be vigorous, for the public have
taken it to heart. “Cavalleria” is so full of life,
colour and harmony that they have forgiven its
brevity. The most part of a longer distance opera
is contested at half speed, but this is a six furlong
flutter with all the performers right there at the
finish. Such a finish ! Whilst the tenor stiffens
himself out in death at one point of the stage,
with the betrayed soprano and an aged mamma
weeping over his corpse, the baritone struggles
against arrest by gendarmes elsewhere, and even
the chorus are lashed into a fair state of excite-
ment as the curtain falls. The giddy wife, too,
; t a point worth noticing at this supreme moment.
True to woman’s nature, she ignores her slaugh-
tered lover, and becomes solicitous for the safety
of the husband who did the deed. A live hubby
is better than a deceased “ mash ” any day ; more-
over, a warm-blooded daughter of Eve ever rises
is the spectacle of her “ man ” in custody.
# # •
Signorina Mettler plays her little part
well, and although her voice is shrill (like that
of the harlequin “ Pagliacci ”) it sounds pleasantly
in a pretty air. The principals, especially the
prima-donna, have all improved a little on their
admirable first performance. It was claimed for
them that they were specially well-suited to their
work in each of the up-to-date operas, and they
have proved that claim without a doubt. The
fresh, bright singing of the chorus is apt to grow,
careless occasionally, but the orchestra never goes
astray. Some of the violins talk eloquently in
the intermezzo, or rather they get an opportunity
to make their individual voices heard just then.
One solitary weak spot in “Cavalleria” is the
contralto mamma, and she is only a small spot at
the worst.
* • •
On Saturday a revival of “ Pagliacci ” will
start the final week of the Italian season. Dear
old “Pally” is set down for four performances,
after which the more peaceful and three-act opera,
Mascagni’s “L’Amico Fritz,” will be produced
for two consecutive nights only. Meantime the
Blue Ballet proceeds with unabated splendour,
ami the thought of losing Bartho is becoming
very bitter.
* * tif m
At the Royal anew and hopeful manage-
ment hangs on to “The Heart of Midlothian,”
although very few patronise the spectacle, or seem
to appreciate what is good in it after they have
arrived. Emptiness and apathy abounded in the
building all last week until Saturday, when
Pentridge Prison appeared to have broken
loose and carried the dress-circle by assault.
Types of criminal countenances attached to
a monotonous array of bullet-heads surged
into the place usually reserved for the aris-
tocracy, as though they had a prize-tight in
view. The occasion of this shocking gathering
was the presentation of a trophy to the footballer
who had kicked most goals during the season, but
whether the fraternity represented Victoria’s
national game, or were merely its ardent bar-
rackers, the writer can’t say. He only knows that
he walked unsuspectingly into the circle, gave one
frightened glance at the assemblage-and fled. At
a crisis like this, one realises that life is still worth
the living, and the instinct of self-preservation
domes out strong.
** m *
“ Hans the Boatman,” who used to please
Melbourne in its boom-time, came back to the
Bijou on Saturday with a company changed in all
respects, save the big dog and the “ baby
coquette.” The dog was as successful as ever, and
Hans Arnold seemed little the worse for wear,
but the original infant had developed into a
sickly streak of precocity whose unnilturalness
served to aggravate the surrounding bathos. Six
and a-half years ago Arnold produced this same
show—for it hasn’t been revised worth mentioning
—with many points in his favour. In the first place,
the piece was far more tolerable than “ My Sweet-
heart,” of which much more had been expected.
It shone by comparison with Minnie Palmer’s
“ musical comedy.” In the second place, there was
a' ridiculous air of novelty about the idea of a toy
boatman passing for a hero because his sole earth
purpose was blind man’s buff. Thirdly, and chiefly,
a first-rate company worked hard to pull “Hans”
through, whereas the present company mostly pull
him to pieces, and expose the hollow mockery of
his plot. Two or three young men of the
“ jonnnie ” school from England are perhaps
capable of doing something when they get the
chance thrown at them, but they don’t attempt to
create chances for themselves on this occasion. The
lady cast for Myra Kemble’s old part doesn’t
appear to find it inspiring, whilst Miss Dot
Frederic, as Jeftie, is rather fatal. She is a
neat little lady, trying desperately hard to do
what Puttie Browne did of yore, and failing in
the attempt. Ancient reputation may come to
the rescue of “ Hans the Boatman,” and save it
from an early collapse. Good houses and high
spirits are absolutely necessary for an artificial-
sentiment show. On Saturday it seemed that
everybody was low-spirited and conscious of a
something wanting. Towards the finish even the
big dog walked moodily off the stage when his
master struck up another song.

Other entertainments are looking forward
with anxious eyes to the racing season and hoping
for the best.

Brough and Boucicault, during their last

Hardly anyone knows there was a former

in 1850-1, at the bookselling shop of John Pullar,
Coll ins-street, and was a resumi of magazine
articles.
A big thing in real estate is the cabled
announcement of the purchase of the Peninsula

North and Baron Henry de Worms are members;
the vendors are the Government of Mexico, and
the figure is Jtt), 000.000. “It is the intention of
the buyers to get their purchase annexed to the
United States.” So that they have bought the
people too !
Hamilton’s motion in Q. Assembly to in-
crease the payment of members was lost at the
stage at which the “House” was asked to agree
to the resolutions of the “Committee.” Burns
(Townsville) and Thorn (Fassifern), who had sup-
ported the motion, absented themselves from the
division, and the voting was equal. Whereupon,
the politically-hypnotised Speaker Cowley gave
his casting-vote with the “ Noes ” —the third time
this session that the MTIwraithian pleasure has
been consummated by the Speaker’s vote only.
The Wild-Cat Column.
The N.S.W. million 4 per cent, loan has gone
off in London with a whoop of exultation at a nominal aver-
age of £lOO lls. lid. Considering the state of the market,
the awful manner in which the bottom fell, not so long ago,
out of Australian securities, and all other circumstances,
it was a great and altogether unexpected triumph, and
The Bulletin, like almost every other paper, was out in
its forecast, of coming events. And yet it is melancholy
to consider how very little it takes to make a triumph in
these times. In 1888, N.S. Wales sold 3j percent, deben-
tures at £lO3 12s. 2d., and in 1883 it realised £lO2 Bs. for
the same class of security. This wasn’t regarded as any.
thing very far beyond the average ; it was not a triumph,
but a reasonably successful business transaction. A'ow
the country gets £lOO lls. lid. for 4 nor cent, stock, and
is filled with the wild thankfulness and amazement of a
man who understood he was to be burnt alive and now
discovers he is only to be hanged.
* # #
After making the usual allowance for expenses,
commissions, &c., the N.S.W. loan will realise to the
borrowers just £9B 17s. 9d. per cent. Loans at the same
rate of interest are floated in Sydney at par. Therefore,
provided the province doesn’t want to go in for another
financial delirium tremens, and revert to the grand old
policy of borrowing everything it can lay its hands
upon, the local market is even now the more profitable of
the two. And if London gets back to its former level,
the local market, will he very much the more profitable
of the two. Unless the Dihbs Govt, is going on another
hideous “jag,” and all its promises of retrenchment are
bogus and brass, there is no earthly excuse for floating
foreign loans at all. There is as much money available at
4 per o nt. in N.S. Wales as any economical Govt, can
afford to borrow.
* * «
The Federal Building Society’s reconstruction
fell through after a riotous meeting of shareholders, and
the society, for the present, at all events, will go on
liquidating. The failure arose chiefly through the direc-
tors’ hungry anxiety for dividends at a time when
dividends can’t be had. The scheme submitted was
practically this: the shareholders pledged themselves, for
a certain number of years, to be satisfied with 5 per cent,
profits on their paid-up capital of £120,000, and the
depositors were to get what remained until all liabilities
were paid off.
« • *
The depositors, on the other hand, naturally
demanded that they should be paid off before dividends
commenced. If the shareholders—or rather the directors
—had agreed to this proposition they might, considering
the position of the society, which is rather better than the
usual bursted-bank average, have gradually paid off all
liabilities and saved their capital intact, or nearly so, and
then started to prosper once more ; but now, thanks to
their hunger after an immediate 5 per cent., everything
will probably melt away as usual in the process of liquida-
tion. The average dog only drops his bone to grab at a
shadow of about the same size. The Federal canine, being
more foolish than the average, is dropping about half an
ox to grab at the pallid adumbration of a sardine.
« • •
“It has now been practically decided that bank-
ing legislation will be postponed in N.S.W. until the
leading hanks are agreed among themselves as to the kind
of legislation required." (This item was originally set up
by the insolent compositor to read that noggingJegis-
lation was to be postponed until the leading larrikins w ire
agreed as to whether it was necessary or otherwise, h’’t
that is entirely beside the case)
* # •
The Bulletin now desires to explain what a
lot of tire banks want, so that banking legislation rued
not be any longer delayed. The desired Act can all go
into a few clauses: (1) No depositor, whether on current
account or otherwise, shall withdraw any money without
the full concurrence of the directors ; (2) No person shall
move au amendment at the annual or half-yearly meet-
ing, or ask questions, or want to know in any shapo or
form without previous permission from the directors;
(3) No paper shall comment unfavourably on the balance-
sheet without first obtaining the sanction of the directors ;
(4) If the hank wants money, no person shall refuse to
become a depositor without the consent of the directors.
• # # ■
Then there are a few more items : (5) No person
shall feel any want of confidence in the bank, or entertain
any suspicions about it, or hear, know, be aware of, or
circulate any rumours concerning it, or dream unfavour-
able dreams about it, or suffer from any want of en-
thusiasm with regard to it, or view it otherwise than
with the most profound respect and admiration except
with the entire concurrence of the directors; (6) No
accounts shall be filed, and no audit held, and no notes
cashed, and there shall be no meeting of shareholders,
and no bills pball fall due, and no money shall be payable
in any shape or form unless with the full approval of all
the directors ; (7) All trust-funds shall be put on fixed
deposit in the banks, and every director shall have all the
overdraft he wants on security to be approved by himself,
and no director shall be removed except with his own
consent.
• • •
One more ; (8) It having been found that the
public trial of officers who embezzle the funds of the
hunk has a tendency to arouse suspicions contrary to
section 5 of this Act, any such officer shall in future he
removed to the cellar of the bank and there secretly and
instantly executed with the sanction of the directors.

Those credulous individuals who read W. E.
Abbott’s letters and listen to N.S.W. Minister Lyne’s
speeches about the glories of the American “private enter-
prise ” railway system, and the advantages to he gained by
going and doing likewise in Australia, will probably he
astonished to learn that 63 per cent, of U.S. railway
capital pays no dividend at all. This 63 per cent, of the
capital represents nearly 75 per cent, of the railway
mil age. The goods rates vary from Jd. per ton up to
Is. 9d. per ton per mile; the U.S. ton, by the way, is a
trifle under 18 cwt.—a fact which Abbott and Lyne never
allude to.
• • •
The Jd. rate for 18 cwt. is the lowest in a,ll the
United States; it is the triumph of American railway
enterprise, and though it exists on one line only, and
only for certain classes of goods, and provided these
goods are sent in large quantities over the whole length
of the line, yet it is quoted as if it were a thing of
ordinary and regular occurrence. The N.S.W, minimum
is about a farthing and a half per ton of 20cwt. and the
one-and-ninepenny rate, or anything even distantly
approaching it, is unknown. Moreover, there are two
separate ways of estimating freight charges. One is to
go by the actual nett weight of goods conveyed ; another
is to go by gross weight, this latter being the beautifully
simple device of taking the whole weight of a loaded
freight train, trucks and all. On the latter basis the
average freight chargesin N S. Wales are, as nearly as pos-
sible, a farthing per mile all round. On which ha;sis are
the American freights estimated when W. E. Abbott is
raving in the correspondence column of Sydney Tele-
graph ?
• • •
As regards passenger fares, the average rates
are lower by about 12 per cent, in South Australia, Vic-
toria, and N.S. Wales than on the private railways of
England, and about 5 per cent, lower, according to the
latest available figures, than on the railways of the U.S.
Therefore, Australia has much to be grateful for in its
tate railway system, and even the most energetic
R
garbling of figures by interested persons can't altogethei
disguise the fact.

The prospects of the richest mine on earth art
nothing when compared with the prospects of the “ Aus-
tralasian Fish, Poultry and Fruit Exporting and Pre-
serving C 0.,” capital, 200 shares of €6 each only; of
which but 30 go to the promoter, whose name is net
given. The approximate statement of expenditure and
income for 12 months is a knock-ont for everything else but
the fish business, as one item will suffice to show. Twenty
pigs and 1000 head of poultry will cost to purchase £6O ;
£6 is provided for food, and £7 for an incubator. Annual
receipts from poultry, pigs, and eggs are put down at
£3OO. The anticipated 12 months’ catch includes 1000
bags oysters, 1000 crayfish, 1000 schnapper, 1000 barra-
couta, 1000 trumpeter, and all other fish exactly 1000.
£3OO is to be made out of 100 tons of manure ; and £l5OO
a year out of salt fish. And £2155 profit on a capital ex-
penditure of £845.

The Citj Bank of Sydney has obtained authority
from its shareholders to issue new shares to the amount
of £1,000,000, thus increasing its capital from £500,000 to
£1,500,000. Meanwhile the shares of the first issue, £8
paid up, are offering at £4 10s. with no buyers at the
price, and the second issue, £6 paid, can’t find buyers at
£3. Therefore the difficulty of inducing the public to

When is Melbourne to be quit of the wretched
gag that “an enormous shrinkage has taken place In the
value of land securities”? A vulgar little hoy applies a
straw to a frog and blows the creature out io twice lt|
ordinary siz«. As soon as he ceases to blow, the frog
returns to its normal dimensions. There has been no
shrinkage whatever. Tis the same frog as before, but if
not arrived at full maturity it will tircnv larger by degrees.
Now, land in the Melbourne district has not even yet re-
turned to its natural cash size. Some of “ boom ” blow is
left in it, and it will have to get rid of that inflation
before a “shrinkage of values” can commence. And
land never shrinks in value whilst the population holds
on.

Dear Bulletin, —Now that papers eulo-
gistic of the S.A. system of free, secular, and
compulsory education have been read in the Ad-
vancement of Science Congress, I must throw my
brick. The classes are unmanageable. It is
indisputable that when a class exceeds 30 in num-
ber no opportunity is afforded for thorough teach-
ing. When I mentioned this to the head master
of an Adelaidestiburban State school he acquiesced,
and said ; “Still, never look fur a class of less
than 70 children.” And it is so-wherever the
population allows the S. A. E location Department
to play at Napoleon’s game of concentration.
Last Xmas a lady teacher, of naturally strung
constitution, exhausted by her work, consulted a
doctor, who told her that no one should attempt
to teach more than 30 children. Her class-roll
numbers over 90. John Hartley, 8.A., 8.50.,
Inspector-General of Schools, says he must cut
down expenses. He has to sacrifice the teachers
to please a paring Govt. A S.A. teacher’s life is
so dreary, so villainously adapted to sap his vital
energies, that, had a teacher brains, he would
blow them out.—Bmk There.

telling me that wo know nothing, or appear to
know nothing, of the movement in literature
lately started in France to be continued all over
the world--in the manner of other civilised
fashions. He says, my friend, that a new literary'
luminary, by name Jean de Reive, has arisen, and
has produced a sensation comparable only to
those produced by the Franco-Prussian War and
the advent 6i Father A 1 Baylut, the Oriental

French novehsm, and is the Apostle of a cult
which endeavours to combine the grasp and
analysis of Balzac with the romanticism of Hugo,
and the realism of Flaubert and De Maupassant.
Anyhow, the following is my nest attempt at a

The; Valley of Jehoshaphat is small and narrow,
but may contain many; even as the brain which
is a little grey clot in itself contains thoughts that
go forth unto the ends of the universe.
In the midst of that valley, upon a high place
in the centre thereof, sat in judgment the Twelve
Apostles and the Son of Man whose name is
Christ.
* # #
Many souls passed before Him—and went to
their own [dace.
And then came one—a shade with sullen, proud
eyes and brow unquailing ; hands behind back in
the old attitude.
Millions of spectral arms—of the early dead on
the battlefields of Europe, of the widows, of the
orphans—vvere raised in denunciation.
“ A has cried the spectres.
“ What hast thou now to say for thyself,
Napoleon ? ’ asked the Great Judge.
“Let him first speak, Attila, who was thy
Scourge,” he replied.
Then appeared the shade of Attila and spake,
pointing to Christ —“I was His messenger. His
word was that He came not with peace but with a
sword. And I came with a sword.”
But the millions raised their hands, and cried,
“ A bus! ”
The shade of the Great Emperor passed not
from before the front of the Throne.
“Thou art,” said the Judge, “condemned even
by those without condemnation of mine. If,
therefore, thou hast any to say a word for thee let
them say it now.”
Through the throng of spirits thousands upon
thousands pressed, waving arms more wildly than
did the millions.
Ah, waving arms !—waving ghosts of muskets—
waving in one hand arms they had lost, and were
proud to lose, under the eyes of that great
Emperor.
“ L'Enfer /” said the Judge.
“ Vive VEmpercur /” cried tb“ legions and
followed their Master.
* • •
“Not that way,” said the Judge. “Thou hast
all been my servants. But thou hast, not know-
ing any other, set up a god of thine own as thine
ideal, and hast followed him through tire and
blood and much misery. And for that thou hast
an ideal, and didst according to thy lights follow
after it, enter into my peace.”
They returned, and as they passed by Him the
Great Judge said, “Remember, messieurs, there
will be no gunpowder to eat in heaven.”

The notorious Mrs. Frank Leslie (lately
divorced from her third husband, Willie Wilde)
indignantly denies a report that she is about to
remarry—“lf an angel from Heaven came down
to earth and asked me to marry him I should

substantial bridegrooms.
“Much,” says Modern Society, “has
been said by toadying papers of the Duke of
Connaught’s ‘ service in the field !’ It is humili-
ating to an Englishman to read such twaddle.
Every schoolboy knows that the Duke’s share in
the battle of Tel-el-Kebir was a mere pretence—
that he hugged the canal on the left wing all the
way, nursed by an advancing steamer, and that
the men lie ‘ led' into action were kept so carefully
out of reach of bullets that their lives were as safe
as if they had been oiflatrine-duty.”
The Gentleman’s Mac.azine (London)
recently published an Australian story with some
points of novelty about it. The hero of the tale
is English. He can’t find employment in
Sydney, so he goes out into the pathless wilds—
the pathless wilds evidently begin about Newtown
—to look for fortune and adventure. His way
lies through virgin forests where the tree-tops
shut out the light of day. One morning he hears
much shooting just ahead, and rushing forward
he finds a wounded man entrenched behind a dea 1
horse and keeping off a horde of infuriated
Maoris with his gun. The hero scatters the horde
with a revolver, and the other man takes him
along to his “cattle ranohe ” in the vicinity, and
treats him like a brother. In fact, he treats him
like several brothers. A little while later the
owner of the “ranohe” dies of malarial fever,
which is a particularly fatal complaint there-
abouts owing to the swampy nature of the country
in New Soutly Wales, and the hero inherits the
“ranohe,” which is worth a billion pounds or
thereabouts, and lives long to be a terror to the
Maoris in these regions, and an ornament to 014
England,

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at
a nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to
cure the worst cases. General debility, nervous-
ness, weakness, and general complaints of the
digestive and nervous systems are promptly cured
by these reliable remedies. They are prepared
by scientific processes, and are not merely
mechanical mixtures made only to “gull the
public.” The renown CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have won in Australasia
is proof of the fact that they stand pre-eminent for
their special classes of diseases. No remedies
ever sold gave such entire satisfaction to their
patrons, and evidence is forthcoming from every
city, town, and village to prove their virtues. No
doubt can now exist as to their value, but pur-
chasers must be careful to get the genuine articles,
as many unscrupulous traders will attempt to
palm off a substitute if possible, for the sake ot
extra profit.

SOME SPORTING SUBJECTS.
Dr. Stuart, Anglican Bishop of Waiami
(M.L.), who has surrendered his see to go as a
missionary to Persia, is a brother of ex-Promier
Stuart, who succeeded the Parkes - Robertson
coalition in N.S.W. Still another brother is Pro-
curator-Fiscal in Edinburgh, and a nephew fills
the professional chair of Applied Mechanics at
Cambridge.
The late H. M. Bindon, defending Ned
Kelly, recalls the story of Vic. ex-Chief Justice
Stawell, who, as a young man, was very weak at
the Bar. Defending a prisoner he snuffled :
“Gentlemen of the jury, regard this miserable-
creature at the bar.” “Miserable yourself! Who
the devil are you calling miserable?” yelled
Stawell’s exasperated client.
The title of “Honourable,” conferred on
Saul Samuel, is about to be applied for in the
interests of a host of Australian Cabinet relicts.
Samuel was a member of five or six Cabinets, but
anyone who has been a member of a single Cabinet
has an equal claim, and thus nearly two-thirds of
Australian politicians are eligible. Which brings
it at once to the C.M.G. level.
The lately-deceased Inspector Ahern—•
“ Jacky-Jacky, ” the successful horse-thief-catcher
of the Barcoo(Q.)—used to boast, inliis own peculiar
stutter, that he never took a gratis bite from a
settler, and never asked for shelter, “ bub-bub-
bub-bekase, Oi mum-mum-meet thim all on an
aohe-ache-aiqual flitting ! ” By marriage, he
became related to Thynne, M.L.0., and Judge
Pat Real.
A prominent member of the S.M. Herald
proprietary said lately that Radical literary
talent is much more abundant in Australia than
Conservative talent, and that if he were a pub-
lisher who desired to publish mere talented writ-
ing, he could do it at less than half the expense
which the production of Conservative mediocrity
would entail. That is to say, it costs a lot to
shore up the Tory lie.
Richard Speight roams about Melbourne
looking the picture of hope deferred since his
libel action against the Age was adjourned for
another month. With a less substantial neck to
support him, the plaintiff, in such a case, would
have been dead long before now, but Richard is
built to stay. Though the law’s delays affect his
spirit they can’t take an ounce off his indomitable
neck. It is a case of neck or nothing with the ex-
railway commissioner.
Premier M‘ll wraith (Q.) sleeps at Brisbane
Parliament House whenever the ’Ouse sits after
tea, and a State-paid waiter has to sit up on those
occasions to see the fat statesman to his double-
bed. Rumour has it that the Civil servant has to
unlace Mac.’s boots, and that, in his absence,
Mac., who is a failure at stooping, would have
to go to bed in his boots. In the morning, the
valuable flunkey has again to lace the big boss’s
boots. For of such is the kingdom of Eat Man.
The death of stockbroker - journalist
Wallen, of Melbourne, gave the Age and Argus
a chance to show their miserable littleness. The
Age stated that Mr. Wallen was for years a con-
tributor to the Age and Leader— ignoring his
connection with the Argus and Australasian.
The Argus, on the other hand, omitted any
reference to the Age and Leader. But both of
these “great” journals recognised the fact that
Wallen had edited a Banking Record, inasmuch
as it didn’t issue from the office of either great
journal. Noble candour!
It is announced that—
The pocket-book of the late Henry Sampson (“Pendra-
gon,” of London Referee) is in the possession of Mr. John
Plummer, of Sydney, to whom it was forwarded, as a
memento of old limes, by “Pendragon’s ” widow.
By Widow Pendragon ? Is that so ? Mrs. Samp-
son died long before “ Pendragon ” did, and if the
latter married again, then Mr. John Plummer, of
Sydney, has been about the only Australian
hitherto aware of the fact. And if the second
Mrs. Sampson has sent John Plummer “Pen-
dragon’s ” pocket-book, of what “ old times ” is it
a memento, anyhow ?
A Bulletin correspondent writes from
India: —
Having with us at Colombo the other day a phono-
graph, which we had hopes of selling in India to some
affluent Rajah or other Oriental potentate, the idea
occurred to us to exhibit it to the Egyptian exile, Arab!
Pasha. After many lingual difficulties of explanation
had been overcome, all that we could got out of the
Oracle was a point-blank refusal to see or hear the phono-
graph, in this wise ; “The machine is not of my country.
No, I will not have it in my house. I am very angry
with England ;I am not in my country.” When we tried
to explain that the invention was American, Arab!
knocked us out with—“ All the same.”
So many petty maydrs and aldermen are
in the political field that the coming N.S.W.
Assembly bids fair to be known as the Mule
Parliament. Ev.ery greasy, ungrammatical Bumble
who hitherto has managed to make ends meet,
“by honesty and civility combined,” in the
grocery and vegetable line, and who has succeeded
in engineering a job of grading and metalling
some back lane or other, and every crank, from the
man who thinks himself a scientist because he
chanced to find some reptile or other whose caudal
development was rather abnormal, to the man
who talks of salvation and thinks himself
“saved ” because his pylorus is out of order, now
imagines himself a Lycurgus, and, “at the urgent
request of the great majority of the electors, is a
candidate,” &c., &c.
A S.M. Herald writer asserts that the
celebrated Margaret Catch pole died a solitary
soul, without leaving child or relative behind her
in N.S.W.—which statement should considerably
relieve the feelings of more than one leading Aus-
tralian and Tasmanian family. She was 58 when
she died at Richmond, in 1819, and so was 40
when she arrived at Botany Bay in 1801. She
was no heroine endowed with superior gifts and
graces, and crowning a pathetic misfortune by an
idyllic marriage—as she has been sometimes repre-
sented —but a homely-featured, unlettered Eng-
lishwoman of the lower class. Peggy, as she was
familiarly called, has been described by one who
know her intimately in life, and perfectly remem-
bered her dead face as she lay awaiting burial, as
of a short, stout, thickset figure, by no means pre-
possessing in appearance, and very decided in her
“ ways ” and temper.
“ I told him I would give him that. Now
he’s got it!” Tims spake the elect of Williams-
town (Vic.) after informing Shiels that he (Carter,
M.L.A.) “never married a rich wife and loafed
on her money.” Then Shiels reminded the hon.
member that the honourable member knew that
he (Shiels) “could retort with deadly effect, if he
liked.” But no retort except instant skull-fracture
could have a deadly effect on a vituperator of
the hog-like Carter’s calibre. That miserable
exchange of personalities arose out of a
debate on the claim of an old man, named
Heaney, to select a small streak of land in the
wilderness. However, ex-Premier Shiels has no
cause to wince at the hog-like Carter’s brutal
taunt, for in his own way Shiels tries to “ work
for his country ” and dabble in “ statesmanship.”
Mrs. Shiels is a fine, handsome woman, of the
essentially wholesome order of beauty. If Shiels,
the tutor, hadn’t done his level best to marry such
a daughter, he would have deserved to die a
miserable old bachelor, with a frowsy landlady
breathing rum-and-water into his last moments.
That awful explorer, “A. C. Calvert,”
writes again in an English magazine about his
alleged discoveries in Australia :
At a place marked on the map as Wild Dog Creek
[Wherever that may be.—Ed. B.], in the neighbourhood
of the Shawe River [Heaven only knows where that may
be.—Ed. B.], I came upon a mount rising boldly from the
range bordering the river. Upon exploring it [“explor-
ing” is good], I found it so extraordinarily rich in gold
that every panful of earth washed out in its vicinity gave
most excellent results. It might be called a hill of gold.
Upon the spot I christened it (by way of paying a small
compliment) after my good friend the Earl of Caledon,
“ Mount Caledon.” The soil is chiefly a conglomerate
passing into ironstone, and can best be described as being
“saturated” with gold throughout. But the enormous
amount of treasure held in trust by “Caledon” was not
all. Diverging from my course to follow the line of this
phenomenal “find,” I was the more impressed by the
value of my discovery by every fresh experiment I made.
Two miles from the place I had first tried, I broke
from a leader in the conglomerate a piece of rich
metal nearly as much gold as quartz. Just touching
it with the hammer the fryible quartz fell away, leaving a
flattened piece of pure gold behind. Two miles further
on we halted at some native wells or clay-pans which were
dry, but, upon removing the rocks, we found a soakage
and got some muddy water. Hero also T knocked off a
few quartz specimens, and washed half-a-dozen pans of
earth, which gave out a Very pretty light gold. lam
convinced that enormous results could be oblained in
that neighbourhood merely by dry-blowing, or, better
still, by going to the expense of sinking water-tanks and
saving the gold by the ordinary Cornish bubble or sluice-
box, without resort to any of those deceiving machines
with mercury.
And now it would be gratifying to know why
Calvert, instead of dry-blowing to credulous Lon-
don editors, doesn’t go forth and peg out bis
mountain of gold, and become an Astor and a Jay
Gould and three Vanderbilts and a Croesus
straight off? The self-sacrifice of this gaudy
youth, who knows where there is wealth beyond
computation waiting to be picked up, and is too
tired to go for it, is altogether too much.
Moreover, Calvert is a clumsy romancer, else Ims
wouldn’t want to go dry-blowing just alongside a
river, and further on, when ho wants to sink
water-tanks, he has evidently quite forgotten that
ho said the river was there. It is about time
somebody s nit to London to identify
Calvert,, and present him with a dead cat as a
mark of esteem, and find out if he is really the
garish child of nature who once went fort!) with a
big expedition to explore along a main road in
W. A,, and presently came back because the
condensed milk gave out.
The “ Ghemis case ” is again being stirred
up in Maoriland. Ghemis’ conviction was one of
the ugliest instances of the perversion of circum-
stantial evidence yet recorded. In ’B9 a farmer
named Hawkings, a notoriously unpopular man
with an aggravating temper, was shot on the high-
road and then stabbed. The evidence against
Ghemis consisted of seven separate circumstances.
(1) Ho left his work at an hour which made it
possibleforhim to have reached the scenoof the mur-
der at the time when it was supposed to have been
committed ; (2) he had had a lawsuit with Hawk-
ings ; (3) he was an individual of violent character,
because he had once shot a man—this point
was much elaborated by the prosecution till it was
proved that Chemis had only wounded the marker
by accident at a shooting competition ; (4) He had
a gun in his house, one barrel of which had been
recently discharged; (5) He owned a stiletto
which fitted Hawkings’ wounds —the stiletto was
entirely covered with rust, and obviously hadn’t
been used for years; (6) Some portions of a news-
paper were found in the wounds, having evidently
been used as wads, and the remainder of the paper,
or one very like it, was found in Oheims’s house.
The fragments, however, had been carried about
f6r a considerable time by various policemen before
being produced, and their alleged fitting together
was a matter of much dispute; (7) Chemis’s
children were not called to prove an alibi —though
his wife was. This point was pressed by the
prosecution as a strong evidence of guilt, though
the defence ridiculed the idea of expecting two
very young children to recollect exactly at what
hour their father came home on a particular night
two months past. There were no bloodstains on
prisoner’s clothes or about his house, and nothing
belonging to the dead man was found in his
possession. He had no money, and was defended
gratis by a dying lawyer—his counsel, in fact,
when he had finished his speech, went homo
and died before the case was ended. The
death-sentence was commuted to penal servitude
for life, on the ground of defective evidence—an
illogical proceeding, seeing that it admitted that
Chemis was convicted without reasonable proof
and then left him to suffer the penalty of his con-
viction. Now an agitation is in progress which
will possibly end in his release. The grand
advantage of a rigid hanging law comes in here,
by the way ; it prevents all agitation and worry
after the event. When once a man is hanged,
interest in his case is practically ended, and no
one troubles any further about the defects in the
evidence.

Mrs. W. Kellond, Bega, N.S.W., who writes on
April 26, 1893; About two years ago I don’t
believe there was a greater sufferer in the world
from neuralgia; I believe 1 tried a hundred
different remedies —in fact, everything that was
recommended to me, but without being relieved.
My attention was drawn to Clements Tonic and
the number of oases that had been cured by it—
cases resembling mine. By the time I had
finished three bottles of Clements Tonic I was
thoroughly cured of all neuralgic symptoms, and I
have never had a recurrence of the old complaint.
I have recommended it on all occasions. Hoping
this may benefit others who are suffering from the

gious denomination iu West Australia unassisted
by a State grant. State aid was offered to them
but declined.
Professor Pearson, in a recent Fort-
nightly article on “The Church iu Australia,”
says that owing to their dependence upon their
congregations, iu the absence of a State bonus,
the Australian clergy “ have their power of speech
paralysed.” The Professor is writing against
Disestablishment in England, too !
Mr. J. N. Birks, ag-

When an irresistible
force comes in contact with
an immovable obstacle,
what happens is that the
irresistible force smashes
through the immovable ob-
stacle, and leaves it stupidly
standing with a big bole in
it. So when the Irresistible
force of popular will comes
in contact with the immov-
able obstacle —the House of
Lords or the Legislative
Council, as the case may
be—the latter will, riddled
and stiffened, at once and
for ever stand still—with
such a hole in it that it will
consist of nothing else.
Mayor Manning has

just as easily have gone into the public pocket.
It is only fair that there should be an
Australian party in the Commons. There has
always been an “ Fnglish ” party in Australian
legislatures.
Maoriland Parliament goes to the country
in December. Between the question of Wine
and Woman it will take a prophet to “ spot ” the
next members’ roll.
The Kingston Ministry’s Woman Suffrage
Bill was carried in S. A. Assembly by 21 votes to
23. The measure lapses owing to the want of an
absolute majority, 23 votes.
The Gang will probably try to get the Q.
Elective Upper House Bill through by offering a
otic-man one-vote basis to the Assembly. No
Democrat can accept the compromise. One-man-
one-vote is not worth having under the circum-
stances.
Q. Labour-members voted for the abolition
of the grog-bar in Parliament House, The Q.
Labour-party is also the true.Q. temperance (not
necessarily teetotal) party.
The bigger the Parliament the more fools
and rogues get into it. The smaller the Parlia-
ment the more easily can rogues and fools be
chucked out after getting inside.
It is suggested that at next Maoriland
general election the votes of males and females
shall be taken separately, to see, in the interests
of sociology, how the sexes vote.
The inept conclusion of the inquiry re the
stolen mace in Victoria, recalls that the English
mace was stolen in 1G77, and that the inquiry
then held resulted in the hanging of the thief.
The biggest knock yet received by the
S.A. prohibition cranks is the revelation that it
was Commissioner of Works Holder, a fervid tee-
totaller, who induced his colleagues to advocate a
Govt, wine-depot in London.
S.A. Legislative Council the other day
postponed the consideration of the Progressive
Succession Duties Bill, an urgent financial
measure proposed to partly meet the deficit,
because—Chaffey Baker had a cold !
Minister of Agriculture Oockburn (S.A.)
recently appointed a Government expert under
the Butter Bonus Act, salary .£5O per annum !
This is an insult, considering that the position is
one open to bribery of the worst kind.
An unsigned article appearing recently in
a Sydney paper was ascribed, with their know-
ledge, to the pens of several different members of
the N.S.W. Labour Parliamentary-party, and not
one of them said straightly that he didn’t write it.
Besides £lOOO a year as Q. Premier,
MTlwraith draws £3OO a year as Vice President
of the Executive Council. The chief duty of the
V.P.E.C. is to drive once a week in a hansom at
State expense to Government House and remain
there for an hour.
The Bulletin advises Arthur Rae to take
a friendly ballot of the members of N.S.W.
Assembly on the woman-franchise question. Tins
paper would much like to know how many mem-
bers really believe in woman-franchise, and how
many are using it for advt.
The money borrowed by the various Aus-
tralian Governments lias been used simply to
inflate land values. Why should not the interest
due on the loans bo paid by a tax on land values ?
A sinking fund to provide for their redemption
might also be raised in the same manner.
Julian Salomons blows hot and cold re-
garding his seeking a seat in N.S.W.,Legislative
Assembly. His latest decision is, No. Salomons
recognises that he can’t be Chief Justice, and
thus in weak hours yearns to be Premier—which
would give him the making of Chief Justices.
“A rich capitalist without poor laborers to work for
him is like au air-breathing animal in a vacuum.”—
Theodore Wright (Q.)
Fine rhetoric and true in the abstract. But the
trouble is that the Fat Man never does get into
the vacuum. The “is like” stands only at
“ would be like ” with an “ if.”
The democratic, or suspectedly democratic,
voter in Queensland is, now-adays, numerously
receiving by post, from soma hireling of the
“Patriotic” League, a document stating—“ I have
reason to believe that you are dead,” and calling
upon him to show cause why his name should not
be struck off the electoral roll.
In the absence of a second-ballot provision
in N.S.W., miserable aldermen, who in the wild
rush for seats poll the pig-votes of their friends,
will, after the general election, be found elected
as Ms.P., and representing perhaps but a tenth
of the electors. Neild’s bill for a second ballot
should be supported by every Democrat.
Q. Legislative Council inserted in the
Co-operative Communities Settlement Bill an
amendment disfranchising all residents of such
settlements ! The Assembly rejected this amend-
ment “on the voices.” MTlwraith, who, it is
openly stated, inspired the amendment, was
prudent enough not to risk a division.
David Gaunson harps eternally on the
supposition that the present Mercantile Bank
proceedings are being run by a “ Victorian Liberty
and Property Defence League.” If the aforesaid
League deserves its name, the supposition of
Gaunson is probably correct, more or less. There-
fore hallelujah! Any sort of “conspiracy” for
the casting off of Fat Man’s yoke is a good thing.
It may fail, but, anyway, it has already knocked
the bottom, top, and four sides out of Matthew’s
ancient anxiety to “ meet the charges against
him.”
The new Q. Elective Legislative Council
Bill doesn’t appear to have many firm friends
among the nominee fatocracy. Since a two-thirds
majority of all the members of either House is
needed to pass a constitutional amendment, it
isn’t likely to come to much when it gets into the
Assembly.

Orange (N.S.W.) Leader itself a Free-

The correspondence published in the
Adelaide(S. A.)newspapers between Chaffeyßaker
and the Attorney-General reveals a deliberate
attempt on Baker’s part to provoke from the hot-

Interesting fact for

One reason why Mar-

The committee of
political fatuities from
the Vie. Upper House
engaged considering the'
want of work trouble,
decides that “if a re-
duction of wages were
brought about it would
result in employment
being given where now
it cannot bo got.” This
in a province where
rail way-con tractors can
get men to slave for 2s.

where corporations pay
between Os. and 7s. a
day for a horse,* dray,

wishes to give it them
for nothing, and yet
they are not satisfied
Darling, M.L.C., lately told S.A. Legisla-
tive Council that a Civil servant with =£loo a-
year'certain was quite wealthy enough to bear
retrenchment which, under the Govt, scheme,
starts at .£l5O. Darling, himself, once drove a
water-cart through Adelaide streets, but is now a
wealthy miller.
Would-be chcapeners of legal process
should take a hint from one line of French
practice. In Frencli courts poor litigants aro
wholly and without circumlocutory trouble
absolved from paying counsel’s fees or court or
duty stamps. Their solemn statement that they
can’t pay stands as full payment and commands
the full services of the State.
“ Demos” : “I support Parliaments sitting
in the daytime. In Washington, yon look for the
flag run up over the Capitol when .Congress sits.
Here, men give their minds to business in the
daytime, and public affairs only got the fag-end
of their attention, so that Parliament becomes a
kind of recreation. Let the debates come off in
really valuable time. Then they will be,crisp.”
David Gaunson “intends to show that
there is a conspiracy to get the Government to pay
the costs ” of the Mercantile Bank prosecution.
In other words, Gaunson complains that the case
is to be made so strong that the Government’s
present refusal to pay costs will have to be with-
drawn for the sake of decency. And if Gaunson
doesn’t mean that, what does he mean, anyhow ?
Premier Patterson, talking to a mayor’s
luncheon, at Collingwood, thrust forth his omin-
ous underlip and said : “The parrot-cry that there
is a special law for the rich should be disregarded,
as it is a fie.” Then suppose we say there is a
special law for people who ivere rich a little while
ago? Or no law at all for ex-Speakers, ex-Premiers
and present members of the Legislature? Does
that sound like a lie?
At Parkes’ Rockdale Federation speech
the other night, the most prominent of his local
supporters confessed that they lent their presence
and simulated enthusiasm merely to “ humour
the old man.” Parkes, The Bulletin sees,
has been invited to address the Melb. Democrats
on “Federation.” After the exhibition he made
of himself at Adelaide, too! The poor old
“ statesman ” is now only a joke.
The Argus overlooks the Single-tax prin-
ciples of its protege, Max Hirsch—now found to
be ineligible for election because of his too recent
naturalisation with the assertion that Free-
traders and Single-taxers both want Protection
swept away. “ What is to be done after that can
be left to the good sense of the community.” The
community, as represented by the Aequs, will
then want every Single-taxer’s scalp.
Brisbane item : “Mr. Jas. Tyson, M.L.C.,
is in town to attend to his parliamentary duties.”
Since the Q. Council often sits for only about
7min., and Tyson has never been known to make
a speech, it is hard to see where the “ parlia-
mentary duties ” come in. Moreover, millionaire
Tyson owns so large a slice of Queensland, that his
parliamentary and his private business probably
amount to pretty much the same thing.
Samuel Griffith, Chief Justice, is to be
installed as Provincial Grand Master of Free-
masons under the Irish Constitution in Queens-
land. It would be just as well if all judicial
officials, of all ranks, were prevented by law from
belonging to any secret’ society whatsoever, and
made to take oath that they did not so belong.
It is not enough for the Bench to be pure ; it must
also be above suspicion in the eyes of the many

The people who lack spirit to rise against
the commercial roguery which has admittedly
robbed them of their money are incapable of
troubling about the political roguery that steals
away their public rights and liberties. If they be
not maddened by Moses and his profits, neither
could they be stirred up though one rose from the
dead. It is merely on principle—not with any
hope of effecting an improvement—that The

A S.A. winegrower who trucks grapes ta

evading the border wine-duty, is claimed by S.A.
to be the particular target of the recent N.S.W.

save under certain harassing restrictions. It is
said that the delay, incidental to examination at

Four Ministerial bedrooms have been
luxuriously furnished at Brisbane Parliament
llousej for the use of Cabinefc Ministers. All the

Q. Minister is generally a large man. Little
temporary Lissner was a pure political accident,
This is MTlwraithian “retrenchment” in its
truest sense. The capacious Belle Vue Hotel is
just across a street, and the palatial Queensland
Club is within 100 yards or so of Q. Parliament’s
front door, but Ministers have to “retrench”—
and they start the game at their own pockets.
Sydney Daily Telegraph’s tardy declara-
tion in favour of payment of members recalls a
telegraphic chess-match the writer once attended,
at which there sometimes were two hours’ de-
lay between moves ; on one occasion a whole case
of whisky was drunk between two moves by the
spectators. Metaphorically speaking, the com-
munity has drunk hogsheads of whisky while
waiting for the Telegraph to move—to move
away from the National Association, which it
seems to have now done. “ A straw shows.”
Melb. Age announces in a casual cable-
gram that Patrick Egan and Patrick Ford “have
been commissioned to resume the secret societies
which existed for purposes of outrage and intimi-
'dation in Ireland.” This is absolutely true on the
face of it. As soon as the two Patricks received
their commissions they notified the same to the
public press and set about arranging bloody deeds
as a guarantee of good faith. They even took the
trouble to call upon the Age’s London corres-
pondent, and left their cards, marked in the left-
hand bottom corner—“ Outrages Resumed.”
Premier MTI wraith (Q.) : “Nothing would
detract more from the position of Ministerial
responsibility than a reduction in Ministerial
salary.” This, in a speech defending the reduc-
tion by one-half of the salaries of common mem-
bers, on the score of necessary “ retrenchment,”
was to be expected from the leader of a Govt,
that, while preaching economy, appointed an
Assistant Agent-General at <£looo a year, and
cheerfully voted <£12,500 to the navy of Britain.
Every mariceuvre on the subject emphatically
proves that, as ex-Premier Griffith confessed, the
object sought to be achieved by the reduction of
members’ salaries was the exclusion from the
legislature of Labour-members.”
Mr. J. H. Groodlet.
Mr. J. H. Goodlet, whose portrait appears in
this issue, is a well-known Sydney business man,
who, for a score or so of years, has used his wealth
in establishing and maintaining at his own sole
expense a Home for Consumptives at Thirlmera
(N.S.W.). Mr, Goodlet, in common with nearly
everybody, has felt the pressure of the financial
crisis, and now finds that he cannot afford unaided ly
to bear the burden of the Home’s expenditure, but
has generously handed over the institution (which,
so far, has cost him over .£lOOO per annum), and the
land containing it to trustees at a nominal rental.
An influential committee has been appointed to
devise means for taking advantage of Mr. Good-
let’s munificent offer. A benefit performance in
aid of the Thirlmere Home is to be given by the
Walter Bentley company on this (Thursday)
evening at Sydney Criterion, the bill being
“David Garrick” and “The Silent Woman,”
The services of Mr. Bentley and Co. will be given
absolutely gratis, and as the deserving show is
under most influential patronage a great success
should result.

Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will bo one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
,£lO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well-known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,
who will bo pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

Lady Hopefcoun at the Italian Opera
resembles an artless colleen struggling with the
mysteries of her first pantomime. She comes pro-
vided witli the book of “ Cavalleria Rusticana,”
and her main purpose is to catch the English
translation on the hop, and track the foreign per-
formance to its bitter end. Music and action
proceed rdinost unnoticed by her ladyship, who
simply darts swift, anxious glances at the stage
every now and again. For most of the time she
is poring over her book by the somewhat dim
light of the private box, whilst the suite sit
watching their vice-regal mistress, like so many
patient anglers waiting for a bite. Sweet strains
of melody and bursts of impassioned acting hold
the masses enthralled, but the Countess, with
knitted brows, is turning the leaves of her volume
in weary chase of the plot. It is painful to notice
her distress when, deeming herself at last on the
Verge ef fixing a lino of tlie dialogue, she suddenly
discovers that she is off the scent, and several
pages out iu her calculations.
But, of course, the noble lady has moments of
triumph. There are definite stage directions
dotted about the book, such as—“all enter the
church except Lucia and ’Santuzza.” She fastens
lev fatal forefinger to that lino, and when they do
all file into the tabernacle as stated, Lady H.
passes tho book excitedly round tho box, and
there is more joy over that fleeting discovery of
what is going on than over 99 sinners which need
no repentance. Throe minutes later the Countess
is lost iu the fog again, and remains lost until tho
finish, when the curtain descends slowly to tho
utter confusion of the book, which affirms that it
“falls quickly.” D ized and bewildered, Lady

union was to quit the picture and get the money.”
totter out to get a drink, muttering “the book
was wrong there, and no mistake.”
Tho ballet pleases the Countess considerably,
although the short skirts and huge limbs of D’Argo
strike her as being too ridiculous, really. She
shakes with laughter at the strange gambols of
that purely Italian bounder, and, indeed, D’Argo
reduces most of the women, and many of the men,
to smiles. It needs a Bartho to persuade an
Australian audience, mostly suckled on the bastard
long skirt dancing, that the dancing which fasci-
nated their fathers had a lot more art in it than
the stuff which sassiety girls can imitate fairly
after a short course of lessons.
Kipling, in his latest “ Banjo Song,” makes
the accent in “ kanaka ” fall on the first syllable.
Surely he knows better than this, but as the
majority of English people don’t, it doesn’t matter
much.

worthier of each other’s prowess than a drummer
and a trained nurse. It is, on the face of it, a
Titanic battle. Whichever gladiator scores tho
victory, “honours” should rest “easy.” Tho
world cannot hold more than one drummer who
could circumvent a trained nurse. The earth
could not support more than one trained nurse
who could produce convicting light-o’-love evi-
dence against a commercial traveller. The bag-
man who could undermine the innocence of a
trained nurse is Hypnotism personified. The
trained nurse who could lure a commercial travel-
ler into a corner of self-committal is Strategy
idealised. The issue should involve no question
of damages; it should be a mere sentimental
struggle for Fame—yea, for Immortality.

There is a strong feeling that petticoat
influence is much too potent at the head-quarters
of a certain Australian Department of Education.
Indeed, it is averred that some lady-teachers

their reports on the lady-teachers’ schools to them

Another of the soul-sores of Apothecary
£ £ Smith, M.P. (Vic.), has just been uncovered.
Whilst “representing Australia” at the Imperial
Grocery, Smith sent hampers of Australian wine
to Wales and the Queen, signed “ Lewis Lawrence
Smith,” forgetting to mention that the nation
humbly and prayerfully besought the H.R.H.’s to
sample those drinks ; consequently a cold, blight-
ing answer was wafted back by a frigid flunkey,
to the effect that Victoria and Albert could not
accept unofficial presents, un'ess sent by personal
friends. It was that saving clause that shattered
Smith :
At Melb. City Court, last week, four men
wore committed for trial on a charge of abducting
a Crown witness. At the same Court, two days

had lapsed for want of a prosecutor. But Fat

Dr. Impey, leper-doctor at Robbeu Island,
Cape Colony, has officially reported to the authori-

out of the systems of some 60 of his patients !
Somebody adver-
tises in Auckland
( M. L.) Star for board
and lodging, “ where
the landlady lias seen
b itter days.” Pretty
nearly every • luisb-
house chatelaine has
seen better days and
has to be constantly
choked off to prevent
her telling the
boarders all about
them, but when a
man advertises tor
her in this fashion it
is a direct invitation
to the decayed lady
to relate the whole
story at every meal.
And if she does that,
all the other boarders
will leave —even in-
cluding the silent,
red-haired man who
eats with his knife
and has two helpings
at every meal, and the
asthmatic old gentle-
man who wants to
talk about his symp-
toms all the time.
The latter, in fact, is
quite sure to leave,
because if the land-
lady keeps on talking
about the better days
she used to experience
he can’t get a word
in edgewise about his
symptoms; and then
he begins to conspire
with the old man who
lives on a small an-
ritiity and has a
strange disease in his
legs, and they depart
together. After that
the wild-eyed crank
who wants to hold a
long argument every
night about Irish
politics gets discouraged for want of an
audience, and tlio fading-.ivvay becomes general.
When once the landlady is encouraged to talk
about her better days the boarding-house is
doomed.

I am learning, llulda teaches
(Hulda’s eyes are brightly blue)—
What the noble German speech is,
’Tis a lovely language, too!
I shall always gaily praise it,
But it sounds, I’ll always say,
Prettier when Hulda says it,
Than in any other way.
That my progress sometimes ceases
Causes Hulda some surprise ;
But my grammar goes to pieces
When I look in Hulda’s eyes.
And to tell how I regard her
I’m unable, quite, to say,
For, in German, this is harder
Than it is the other way.
When her glances, fascinating,
To herself my thoughts entice,
Then I’m often hesitating
When I’d say a something nice ;
It takes longer to determine,
And the something nice I’d say
Doesn’t sound so nice in German
As it does the other way.
But in German, or Australian,
Fellow’s feelings do not change ;
Though the maiden lie an alien,
And her language may be strange,
Lack of knowledge don’t exempt you
From emotional display,
For, in German, girls can tempt you
As they do the other way.
Tims, in talking though I’m trying—
Mostly vainly—to be bright,
When she is to me replying
I can understand all right.
When I asked her—just to greet her—
For a little kiss, one day,
ll ll lda’s “ J.i ” was surely sweeter
Than a “Yes ” the other way !
Now we go to church together,
And return together, too ;
Go to church all kinds of weather.
Which I once used not to do.
For I don’t enjoy a sermon
In the language, but I’ll say,
Ilulda’s kisses taste in German
Just as sweet as any way !

Then when the world seemed waled to Ins devotion,

Not from a crow.

A New Guinea love-story—from a des-
patch of the prosaic Governor Macgregor : —
On the left bank of the Lakekamu River there was a
small temporary house, and near to it a little garden of
bananas, sugarcane, &c. It was evident that the place
was occupied, and that the owners must be somewhere
not far off in the forest. Their presence was discovered
by some of our guides shouting to them to come in. They
turned out to be a married couple. The man was about
40, the woman about 35. She appeared first, with a load
of food and firewood on her back, and holding the end of
a stick in her right hand by which she was leading her
blind husband, who held it by the other end. He had
many sores and bruises, the result of knocking himself
against sticks, &c., and he suffered from hydrocele. The
greater portion of his face was eaten away and disfigured
by lupus ; the corrosion had invaded and destroyed his
eyes, so that he was stone-blind, and unique in his ugli-
ness and deformity. She was fearful at first that any
harm might be done to him, but was speedily reassured
on that ground. On receiving a present of a little tobacco
for herself she smiled in the most devoted and affectionate
manner into the fragments of her husband’s face, and
looked with loving eyes into his ulcerated, sightless orbs.
She then put him into a small canoe, seated herself in one
end, and paddled away. He was the most loathsome-
looking husband, and she perhaps the most loving and
devoted wife I have ever seen.

Chief Justice Madden (Vic.) though now

ancing “ square goes ” and “ spirited little mills
has still much reverence for the Noble Art. A
young man named William Morris, found guilty of
“ going for ” a man when down and subsequently
chasing him and knocking his eye out, was
graciously sentenced to three months’Castlemaine
gaol last week. His Honour’s remarks on that
occasion, delivered more in sorrow that in anger,
were most affecting. A distinctly marked quality
of the British race, remarked the learned Judge,
was its desire to see mercy extended to a man
beaten in fair combat with fists. Prisoner had
offended against this beautiful British principle
and against one of the cherished traditions of the
P.R., but he had not been so un-English as to use
a weapon—hence the leniency extended him.

do a term “on his head ” and gain flesh. A few

There’s a principle, or, say, a solecism,
Of the glorious, God-gifted British race,
It is grafted on their love of pugilism,
It’s observance is a guarantee of grace,
And a man is only British inasmuch as
Ev’ry foreign innovation he resists—
And that principle’s a loathing of all such as
Have recourse to any weapons but their fists.
True, one man’s club-like fist at once dismisses
An opponent with a bone-destroying blow.
Whilst another has a hand just like a miss’s,
Which is useless in a scrimmage with a foe,
But by purely British ethics it’s demanded,
If these two be brought together in the lists,
They shall fight their battle, stripped and empty-handed
In the fair, old English fashion with their fists.
Every “educated ” Briton’s learnt the “ science,”
How to pommel-out a fellow-creature’s life,
And to scorn the base assassin whose reliance
Is reposed in a revolver or a knife.
P’raps the reason of his preference for “ slugging ”
In a simple, little circumstance exists—
He is not a don at parrying or “ plugging,”
But he is a perfect dandy with his fists.
’Tween the rascal who exuberantly flays us
And destroys our native beauty in a pub.,
And the ruffian who casually waylays us,
And disfigures all our features with a club.
There’s a difference that not entirely fudge is.
And the first some little sympathy enlists
From their Worships on the Benches and the Judges,
If he does it, like a Briton, with his fists.

Mascagni’s Intermezzo is one of the most popular
pieces of instrumental music ever written. Already there
are 24 editions for various instruments.
Lucy Chambers, under financial stress, has to take a
Melb. benefit, and even appear herself which, perhaps,
is not well-judged. Daughter of a N.S.W. magistrate,
she began her operatic career in Italy, a quarter of a
century ago. She came to Australia with L>ster and
Smith’s Co., including Signora Baiatti, Signors Neri,
Dondi qnd Contini.
It used to he de rijueur for Italian opera-singer* to end
their names with “ i,” but none of Musgrove’s principals
do it.
Eloise Juno and Maud Williamson, on the same stage,
are so much alike that they could repeat the freak of
Miss Mortimer and Fanny Young, who once acted the
Antipholi, in the “ Comedy of Errors,” to the Dromios of
G. V. Brooke and Henry Edwards.
There are speculations on Irving’s retirement. He is
just upon the age at which Macready left the stage, and a
wealthy Thespian does not propose to wait till his powers
are on lire wane. The toothless lion preys on mice.
Harwood is again at the Bijou, as Cattermole, in
the ‘‘Private Secretary.” One sighs to see him and
Stewart grafting again, but Siewart has been much the
worse left.
L. L. Smith has been observed in the amphitheatre at
Melbourne Princess's emitting shrill whistles for Birlho
and the Ballet. He likes the opera much, but the ballet

charming woman Miss Julio Alba, the elder of the
Alba sisters (for some months resident in Svdnev) is to
he married to a Dunedin (M. L.) man.
Stewart’s first Melb. show was when the Royal and
Princess were under a hybrid kind of management by
Harry Edwards and Geo. Fawcett Rowe. Stewart
appeared at the Royal in a piece called “Second Love,”
and the farce of “ Binks, the Bagman,” after which he
was transferred to the Princess’, where he began his
successful career in burlesque with Rowe and Julia
Matthews.
Brough and Boucieautt reputedly cleared £2500 by
their Adelaide season.
At one of the Brough performances Miss Moffatt, an
Adelaide amateur, was hurled at the audience. Tins was
certainly undeserved, as the local people supported (lie
company most generously.
Leoncavallo, composer of “II Pagliacci.”. is Annes
Beaumont over again in features and expression.
Ihe yarn in Melbourne is that one clever member
of the Princess' Opera Go. is a serf, whose boss has
him in hand, and regularly draws bis screw. The fact
appears to be that he is working out a kind of musical
apprenticeship, and is in tow of the agent of the party
who floated him in the profession.
Dear Bulletin,— Your par. about Madame S in
Maoriland, reminds me of an episode in my showman life.
When Fairclough, the tragedian, Elsa May (his wife),
prima donna, Howard Vernon and I were running a
dramatic and operatic co. in Japan, Mrs. Fairclough’s
first child fell sick. One night we were playing opera,
and the prima donna left her child at death’s door. I
took her home after t.ie performance, and we were met
at the door by Fairclough, who simply said: “Our boy is
dead.” I left, without a word. Next day we buried the
child, but the young mother went to the theatre all the
s ime, and I never saw her play her part (Clairette, in
“ Madame^Angot") better, although I knew that her
heart was nigh breaking. By the way, Fairclough has
recently come in for a fortune, and goes “ home ’’ to take
possession.— Duncan Macallim.
At the Westminster Aquarium Just now there is a dusky
gentleman, described as the Invulnerable Fakir, whoso
stage business has charms for the medical profession.
The Fakir pokes a skewer through his tongue, pushes an
eyeball far out of its socket, lures a viper on to bite his
finger, and bolds bis naked arm for 30 seconds in a large
candle flame. Also, he ran a stiletto into his abdomen
every evening until Mrs. Grundy protested against this
portion of the entertainment. Which was rough on the
Fakir, because he tiad got into a way of waiting until his
meat was swallowed before he began to cut it up small
with the stiletto.
The Pantomime at Melb. Royal is to be run on a novel
kind of cominonivealth system. Hands in receipt of no
more than 30s. a week are to draw full pay for certain.
The higher-price people will receive coupons for the
nominal amount of their weekly salary, to bo honoured
in proportion to the success of the show. Jf it yields a
profit over and above full expenses the management pays
f ill salaries and scoops the profit. If it shows a loss the
players bear their proportionate shares of the same in
deductio >s from salaries. The Rent seems to stand on
velvet. The landlord always “gets there.”
David James (proper name Belasco) died last week.
Memories of old Strand burlesques famous for the fooling
of James and Thorne, prior to the days of Terry and
M >tins, are awakened by the announcement of David’s
deceas >. A good many Anglo-Auslralians will recall to
mind “ The Field of the Cloth of Gold,” “ Kenilworth,”
&c., wherein James played the short, fat burlesquer,
contrasting with his friend, Thorne, who was long and
tnin. After the two men, in conjunction with Harry
Montague, opened the London Vaude.Tile, this clever
Hebrew became a com dian of the Anson type. “The
Two Roses was the triumvirate's first production, and
James made a hit as Our Mr. Jenkins. Montague left the
11 rui after a while, and the management relapsed into
burlesque, w ith Nellie Power (ifow dead) for “ principal
b iv. Then the partners, now getting into years,
abandoned burlesque, and went in for a run of old English
comedies. Nineteen years ago, David James created
The Bnlterman in “Our Boys,” and when that gold-mine
was exhausted he had'had about enough of hard theatrical
work. He left Thorne soon afterwards to carry on the
Vaudeville alone, and the present generation saw him but
seldom. He became a special-engagement actor, and bis
bank-account was reported to be very bulky.

George Musgrove, with Arnold, Harwood and Thornton,
sat out “ loianthe,” performed last week at the Bijou by
Melb. amateur opera co. George always attends such
performances with an eve open for possible recruits for
the Royal Opera Co. He found one this time in Miss
F. Irving, who looked, acted and sang the part of Fairy
tyieen like another Alice Barnard. S ie was quite profes-
sional in her self-contained performance.

Antoinette Sterling, they say, talked like a mother to
Lohr ere She bade him farewell. Antoinette, in
the course of her business dealings with this wicked
world, lias observed that advance-agents are often
temuted by circumstances to drink whisky, and she
frankly admitted to Lohr that she feared he seldom weal
many weeks together without tasting spirituous liquor.
At which Lohr rubbed his brow thoughtfully, and finally
remembered that he tws sometimes induced to take a
little refreshment. Antoinette made him promise, how-
ever, that he would run all future “stars” on cold-water
principles, the lofty expression on Lohr’s face as he fell

Only have to say‘No,‘ instead of ‘Yes,’” explained the
Christian Scientist, and Lohr protested for the last time
that nothing was easier. Since then it has become the
custom to drag Lohr to a bar and beg him to have
some water neat. “No,” he says, firmly. Then you
put a wee drop in his glass, and he drinks with his eyes
shut. Or, more generally, Lohr drags the other man to a
bar, where they call it lemonade for Madame’s sake. But
nothing would induce him to go back on his word to the
old lady.
After all, Mias Fortesoue has not quite arranged for a
tour in South Africa. Sue intimated “she expected Mr.
Searelle himself to accompany her on tour. He had gone
with Mrs. Potter—why not with her?” Since then she has
climbed down ; but Luscombe says he knows that the
lady, having raised such a point, must be difficult to deal
with, and ds he had a severe dose of Brown-Potter he is
not disposed to risk Colney Hatch all along o’ Miss.

Mrs. Brough tells this herself. Just as the train was
leaving Melbourne for Sydney', an old woman was bundled
into the carriage reserved for the ladies of the B. and B.
Co. She didn’t know them. Presently she touched Mrs.
Brough’s arm and whispered, “Do you know there’s a
troupe on the train?” “Ah?” said Mrs. B. “Yes,
there's a troupe o’ them play actors on board, playactors,
mind ye. Oh, them's a fast lot, them actresses. Ye cud
Scrape the paint off o’ them with a carving-knife, jre
cud.” The old party drivelled on till the others fell
asleep. At Seymour the old dame got out to stretch her
legs, and a moment after rushed back to drag her late
companions out to see two of “ them actresses.” “ Look,”
she exclaimed, “them's two on ’em, them with the
horstrloh feathers.” Mrs. Brough declined to step out to
see. The old woman got mad, and said, "Oh, you’d
come out quick enough if some o’ them actor chaps was
about.”
Wyburd, of Boidi Aquarium, tells this. The three
pianos at Bondi are tuned by contract, and the tuner
naturally only comes when sent for. But the other Satur-
day lie turned up without being sent for, and set to work
vigorously on the best piano. He cleaned the old cigar-
ash off the keys, and unscrewed and polished everything
with patient elaboration most unusual in a man not paid
by the hour. Then lie gave everything a final polish and
presented the clerk with an account: “ Larmonr, for
tuning piano at Coogee Aquarium, 155.” “This isn’t
Coogee, this is Bondi 1” said the unmoved clerk as the
tuner, with a horrid idea striking him, suddenly fainted
b ickwards into his arms ; “ Larmour’s place is about six
miles away over the sandhills.’’ The tuner slid on to the
ground and sat looking up at him with a dazed expres-
sion. “Better go up to the office and see Wyburd.”
Half a minute laier a wreck of humanity fell forward into
Wyburd’B office.- “ Well,” said that gentleman, “ finished
the piano?” “ Finished the piano!!" said a sepulchral
voice; “why. I've put in'lialf a day tailing the wrong
bl uiky piano. Why didn't you tell me you w eren’t Lar-
mour ? Why—Oli, Moses 1” And with Fat lie gathered
up his implements and started over the hills tow ards the
rival show with six miles of heavy sand to traverse, and
the afternoon fast fading away.
Weatherly, the song-writer, did the English book for
“Pagliacoi,” and did it very well. For instance, one
doesn’t often find Italian opera lyrics translated into
easy verse like this, set down for the clown, Tonio—
“ I know that you hate me and laugh in derision,
For wjiat is the clown ? he plays hut a part.
Yet he lias his dream, and his hope, and his vision.
The clown has a heart.
And, ah, when you pass me, uncaring, unseeing,
You know not my sorrow, so cruel and sweet,
I give you my spirit, my life, and my being,
1 die at your feet.”
Weatherly wrote the words of Tosti’s pretty tenor song,
“ A Tale of Twilight”—just'puhllshed by Ricordi & Sons,
the pushing firm whose music comes from London after
being “ printed in Italy.”

with a heavy heart.

Poem from an American theatrical paper, apparently
addressed to the manager when the ghost failed to walk :
If I should die to-night
And you should come to my cold corpse and say—
Weeping and heartsick o’er my lifeless clay—
If I should die to-night
And you should come in deepest grief and woe
And say, “ Here’s that ten dollars that I owe,”
I might arise in my large cravat
And say: “What's that?”
If I should die to-night
And you should come to my cold corpse and kneel,
Clasping my bier to show the grief you feel;
I say, if I should die to-night
And you should come unto me there and then
And even hint ’bout paying me that ten,
1 I might arise a while,
I But I’d drop dead again.

It ought to be a promising industry in the near
future, for an enterprising capitalist, to buy up
and boil down the unemployed.
The maimed, halt, and blind, likewise pie-
bald Silver Age (Broken Hill), which, after being
a rabid Labour organ, executed a complete somer-
sault during the late strike in order to become a
capitalistic journal, has just died—killed, as it
admits in its 6wn obituary notice, after a long
period of emaciation by a too-restricted diet of
capitalistic adyts. Meanwhile the other local
paper, which is still a Democratic organ, and
hasn’t fallen under the blight of capitalistic pat-
ronage, flourishes like a green bay-tree.
Sydney Sunday Times, in a long, dull, and
unconsciously humorous Masonic item, remarks
that thp members of the Grand Orient of France
‘■enact no devotion to T.G.A.0.T.U., nor,
indeed, so far as we are aware, do they even
adtpit the existence of the Most High.”
“T.G, A.0.T.U.” stands for “The Great Archi-
tect of the Universe,” and why the “ Most High ”
wasn’t abbreviated to the “M.T,” is a mystery,
There is a cheerful blasphemy about proprietor
Evans’ style which goes well with his professions
of reverence. It is almost as well to have no God
as to have only a “ T.G.A.0.T.U.” Who can
have that faith in an initial which bringeth forth
works ?
An up-country Queensland policeman,
who, at the instanceof his sergeant, lately married
to qualify himself for the position of local lockup-
keeper, writes, in an aggrieved tone, to his district
inspector. The narrative shows that from the
time he took possession of the lockup a bushman
from a neighbouring station needed to be run
in for drunkenness every Saturday night regu-
larly, and was as regularly fined ss. every follow-
ing Monday morning, after which he went to the
station and worked till Saturday came round. In
time the bushman came to be regarded as an
established source of revenue, and as there rarely
was anyone else in the lockup a friendly senti-
ment grew up between him and the constable.
But one Monday morning, when the constable had
duly attested to the Saturday revel and had col-
lected the two half-crowns, the bushman, instead
of going back to the station, took an opposite
direction, and has not since been heard of. “The
terrible part of the business,” the constable’s
letter goes on, “ is, that my wife has disappeared
with him, and there’s no one now to look after the
lock-up if 1 happen to bring in a woman. I don't
like to give up the lock-up, for it saves money, but
what can I do? I have good reason now for
judging that the bushman I speak of never was
drunk at all.”
The cussedness of inanimate objects— that
peculiar and unaccountable devilment whereby a
man, if he went at night into Milan Cathedral
or St. Peter’s, would fall over the only chair in
the whole vast building 18 times inside of 15
minutes—is always with ns. The other morning,
a very slow train was pottering along the southern
line towards Sydney. There were two men in
the smoking carriage, also the inevitable lady who
got in by mistake. One of the men had no
matches with him. The other, when he dressed
himself, had somehow put his matchbox into the
pocket of an under-shirt, and as Ids upper-
shirt belonged to that absurd variety of
garment whioh only opens down the back,
the matches might just as well have been in
Persia. The lady cheerfully observed that she
“didn’t mind smoke,” and each man put a cigar
in his mouth. It was only then that they dis-
covered the peculiar location of the match-box.
So, as it couldn’t possibly be got at without un-
dressing, they sat and regarded each other in
gloomy silenoe, and waited for the train to stop
somewhere. It didn’t stop for over an hour, but
at fast it palled up for an instant at a lonesome
station, and the lady got out. The in-
stant it started again a man in that carriage
hurriedly climbed out of his overcoat, coat,
waistcoat, and the most of his shirt, and carefully
hauled out a box containing one match, which
promptly missed fire. Then, in the natural order
of things, before he could olimb into his garments
again the train pulled up with a violent jerk at
another station where nearly forty people took an
interest in his efforts to get back into his shirt and
the rest of his clothes. At this stage the other
man found his own match-box on the floor—and
the train started. And for the rest of the journey
it stopped punctually every five minutes, and at
every stoppage a boy came to the door and offered
matches for sale.
For 223 years before the recent great row

Sydney Chamber of Commerce has adopted
the invention of the “ Ayers Electric Tune Trans-
mitters Co. a simple arrangement which enables
a big establishment to have a clock-dial in every
room and only one real “clock” on the premises.
The real clock works the hands of every dial
synchronously by electrical connection. The
“ works ’’ behind each of the other dials consist
merely of one or two cogwheels and a ratchet, the
latter letting slip one cog every nine seconds. As
simple as standing an egg on its flattened end—
when you : ve once thought of it. The Ayers Co.
supplies the dial and keeps up the batteries for an
almost nominal yearly fee. The idea could easily
bo worked on a big scale by having a central
clock-depot and running wires in every direction.
A shipbuilding revelation. The British
warship Victoria, rammed to destruction by the
Camperdown, was guaranteed unsinkable, while
Admiral Tryon’s signal-box was officially cer-
tified uufloatable, so that after a naval reverse the
secret code could be hidden from an enemy in the
depths of the sea. Catastrophe overtook the Vic-
toria in playtime. The unsinkable ship went
down like a plummet; the unfloatable signal-box
floated on the waves like the genius of buoyancy
and was—grim irony ! —restored to the Admiralty !
Sydney Sunday Times has discovered that
flogging has failed to put down crime, because the
hired skinner only brushes the criminal’s back
with a feeble swish, and, like the Stab, it wants
the punishment “reinforced.” It is not the
quantity but the quality of the flogging that it
complains of. At present it is only laid on by
man power, but the Sunday Times, apparently,
wants it done by steam, in the sure and blessed
conviction that flogging must be a success if
there is only enough of it. It would be a good
thing if the Times would read Foxe’s “ Book of
Martyrs " right through, and then sit down and
think violently. That volume is fuJI of horrors, and
flayed citizens, and disembowelled philanthropists,
but almost every story ends with a statement
to the effect that the patient went on just as
before, and that the flaying had no more moral effect
upon him than a blister has upon a wooden leg.
Therefore, if the bloodthirsty ex-groeer, Evans,
wants to put down crime by horrors he should
remember that his own pet horror, and a good
many other ones, have been tried and found of no
earthly use long ago, and he had better see if he
can’t invent something stronger.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The final matches of the football premiership
(Vic.) were sorry farces. The big clubs take stood care to
arrange their last meeting with a soft “friendly club,”
and the miserable scene is then presented of the latter
playing “ stiff ” to enable their opponents’ goal-kicker to
beat the other man.
# • m
At a Melb, football-match, last week, a dis-
satisfied spectator told one of the players that he was
playing “ stiff,” whereupon the fool bailer walked up to
the fence and “stoushed ” the barracker. A police-court
ease resulted, and each side had to part its own oosEs.
• * •
There is every chance of hot weather and hard
ground between.now and the VJLC. Spring Meeting.
The only horse worth backing at present is Breakdown,
whilst the mares are best left alone.

Villainy on a small scale is contemptible. How
differently the law treats the “crorik” financier and the
wretch guilty of larceny. The same in sport. The A. J.C.
hounded off the silver hookies from the “bob” side, but
allowed the bigger sharks elsewhere to go on.

It is advertised in a Sydney paper that a
m dium who, under the influence of hypnotic suggestion,
named Paris as winner of the Metrop., has, under the
same influence, named the winner of the Caulfield Cup,

public guineas, doesn’t he name the winners of the
Saturday next and hack’em on his own hook? By start-
ing wit h a sov., if the gee-gees averaged 3 to -1, he could
win £3 on the first race, and'come home with £4096.

The only genuine spiritualistic tip, not an after-
game, was by one Miller, of Collingwood, who gave Joe
Thompson Little Jack for Caulfield. This was a2oto 1
show. Joe paid no attention, but after Little Jack’s win
he published the thing far and wide. What a rush there
was on this new prophet Miller for Metb. Cup ; but, alas !
his wilches were as deceptive as Macbeth’s. The news-
paper gohemonohes interviewed hiip, 'Hit - got about as

When Griffo had been a week on the free soil of
America, ami had laid in a slock of gloves and hats and
chaste ties, and had got his feet into bright, tight boots,
and had his visiting-card printed, he hired a gorgeous
vehicle and drove off to interview Corbett. He sent up
the new card and waited for an answer. It came, as
follows: “MivCorbetHs very sorry, but he—aw—really
can’t find time to see any Australian pugilist.” (He’ll be
able to feel one when Ire meets Peter Jackson.) The scene
closes wi th Griffo making observations on the “sidewalk,”
and holding himself hack with both hands to prevent him
rushing upstairs and rending Pompadour Jim as the
Christian used to be rent by the wild beasts of Ephesus.

Griffo finds the Yankee scribes different from

him a billet.

Since The Bulletin mentioned casually that
“ England has taken the knock as regards championship
rowing” London Referee has turned up, wherein the
sporting editor observes: “So far as I can see, boat-pull
ing has died out in' the North, and has not been replaced
by anything.” Then he goes on to suggest that boat-
pulling (professional) has nearly died out in the South of
England. When the “slide” superseded the old fixed-
seat stvle of rowing the Britisher dropped out of the
fray. He doesn’t adapt himself easily to new conditions

The cableinan erroneously made Stanbury beat

on the staff of the National Advocate (Bathurst,
N.S.W.) a youth named William Smith—[Really,
now?—Ed. B.]—about 18 or 19 years of age, who
can give any of these a big start. Smith has to
wear a specially-built size between 8 and 9—Bi, I
believe. When last I questioned him on the sub-
ject, his head was still developing splendidly.—

Fulfil thine office well.
That I may put my burden by
Where deities do dwell—
Whilst many weary years with pain
Will onwards slowly roll,
Patient, persistent, let me gain
That peace which is my goal.
0 Blessed Darkness left behind,
What wisdom thee I owe.
Thou kgptst my soul-sight blank and blind
That light might brighter glow ;

To kill or cure conceit;
Those sms ’twere thankless to repent
That we will ne’er repeat.

The Bulletin Number will be absolutely
original, botli as regards its literary matter audits
pictures, which latter will be contributed by
the leading artists of Australia. The literary
contents will comprise contributions in prose and

Astrnc : “ Passages in Farrar’s ‘Life of
Christ ’ first led me to doubt whether he was ever
a working man, and I believe that researches,
since that antiquated book, prove, as far as can
be proved, that he was not. Orthodoxy does not
( hold that Christ was endowed in any point of
| education which could be achieved by human
means. Deutsch, in his sensational Talmud
article (Quarterly Review), traced Christ’s in-
timate knowledge of that work—the study of a
lifetime. It is ascertained that he knew three
languages, and all inquiry points to Ids having
’obtained a first-class education. With all respect,
his sympathy for the people may be likened to
that of Mr. Higinbotham, that of an educated
gentleman,”

Don t fish for sharks in a rain-barrel
but print your advertisement where it will be seen. “In
my travels in Australia I found -The Bulletin every-
where, and everywhere found it powerful,” wrote David
Christie Murray in the London Costkmi'oiiauy Review.
That is true. The universality of Tin: Bulletin's circula-
tion in Australasia is the envy of all other papers. In and
beyond Australia, The Bulletin, now in its fourteenth
year of issue, is the most popular, best-known, best-
quoted. and most widely and numerously circulated of all
Australasian publications.
When the Lord sends a call to his servant,
Per the post or the telegraph-wire,
Lo, the slave in the vineyard is silent
’Till enlightened regarding the hire.
In his day and his own generation
The disciple is carnally wise,
And he only gives ear unto Heaven
When it offers its servant a rise.
Dear Bulletin, Apropos Labour-mem-
bers, I submit that the most interesting type as
well as the truest, was the first —Charles Jardine
Don, the working mason, who in the Sixties repre-
sented Collingwood, and was the senior member,
with Graham Berry (then owner and editor of
Collingwood Observer) as his colleague. He was
originally put in by the stonemasons and was the
most powerful stump-orator of his time. There
was then no payment of members, and Don
worked on the foundations of Melbourne Post-
office until 4 p.m., when, having dressed himself
in the suit of black that Mrs. Oliphant declares is
so dear to the heart of every Scotchman—and in
which, by the way, lie looked most uncomfortable
—he took Ida place in the Legislative Assembly,
where he literally pulverised the Queen’s English
and knocked the bottom out of every grammatical
rule. With the strongest lungs ever 'given
to a man of sft. 3in., he would draw 10,000 to
a meeting in the old Eastern Market and carry
all before him, Don became a power in the land,
and commanded the attention of the Assembly, as
by common consent he was the trusted exponent
of Labour—“ I pound the bluestono by day and
the squatters by night,” he said, “ and will drive
them across the Murray with their own stock-
whips.” In those days every acre was under lease
to the squatters, and the province was ruled by the
Melbourne Club and the Upper House; and* the
squatters, assisting the merchants to maintain the
importing monopoly which levied blackmail, in
turn were helped to burke every attempt to break
up the land monopoly. This unholy alliance was
really responsible for Protection being so soon
initiated in Victoria, as the defeat of every attempt
to settle people on the land when the alluvial
diggings had failed made Protection absolutely
and inevitably the only chance for the masses.
Wilson Gray was Don’s political mentor, as well as
the instructor of many others in those days.
“Mean men, without mentioning their names,”
was his advice to keep Don out of the scrapes into
which he was always getting, although his apology
was frequently as bad as bis offence. The same
Wilson Gray, although one of the ablest men at
the Bar, was boycotted by the classes and simply
starved out of Victoria, but the Maorilanders made
him a Judge, and he might, had he chosen, have
been Chief Justice. Similar tactics were pursued
in the case of Higinbotham and Michie —who for
18 months was briefless. Don had for a colleague
for one session Wilberforce Stephen, who got in
under his wing. Courage, strong common-sense,
and a sarcastic tongue were some of the attributes
that gained respect for the working stonemason,
whose honesty was never doubted. He had abiding
faith in George Higinbotham, whose sympathy
and assistance he gratefully acknowledged. “The
Attorney-General always put me right when my
rotten-hearted friends were trying to trip me.”
“What shall we do with our boys?” asked a
Protectionist. “ Marry them to the girls,” replied
O'Shanassy. “On the principle that one may
assist the other to starve,” said Don. He added
a new word to the political vocabulary, and to
this day the “purloins” (purlieus) of East Col-
lingwood revive the memory of the first Labour
member. But the Assembly resented his presence
as an intrusion. On the occasion of the actor-
baronet, Sir William Don, visiting the House one
evening, Don tried to get some member to intro-
duce him to his fellow-townsman, but no one
would venture —on the supposition that the
baronet was as snobbish as themselves. Don
accosted him on the stairs. The baronet
stood 0 ft. 4 in., and Don took advantage of the
stairs to get on equal terms with him. To his
surprise he said, “I am Sir William Don—who
are you?” “I’m the other Don,” said the Labour-
member. “You are the very man I’ve been
waiting to see,” said the Baronet, and they spent
the evening together. But human nature brdko
down under the strain of pounding bluestono by
day, and the squatters until three or Sour a.m.,
and then they made poor Don a tobacconist. He
was not a success in this capacity, and last and
worst they made him the landlord of the Rifle-
man’s Arms in Brunswiok-street, Collingwood. The
Augus sneered that there would be a happy
blending of Democracy and two ales, and made
some allusion to the latter being dispensed
by the fair hands of Mrs. Don. Don worshipped
his wife, and it was all his friends could do to
keep him from interviewing the editor. But his
career was drawing to a close. Utterly unsuited
for the business, he failed, rapidly declined in
health and died of consumption. A few of his
political friends stuck to him to the last—amongst
them was M’Lellan known as the “ Dove of
Ararat,”• because he looked so like a badger.
Don’s career was an object-lesson to the Demo-
cracy, and did much to settle the question of pay-
ment of members. The Labour Lien Bill, except-
ing his reputation for sterling honesty, was his
sole legacy.—Yours, J.S.

Frauds. —The spirit of misrepresentation per-
vades all classes of society, and so, amid the
monotonous daily round of public exposure of
trickery and quackery it is indeed refreshing to
the mind to find an oasis, where the element of
deceit has not penetrated. The public have long
been acquainted with the sterling therapeutic
properties of that widely - known preparation
“Marshall’s Tonic Nervine,” having proved its
many excellences, but when the additional
evidence of a gentleman so widely-known as John
Palmer, Esq., Head Bailiff of the Central Police
Court, is tendered, his opinion is worth recording.
He writes:—“By chance, a few weeks ago
one of MARSHALL’S TONIC
treatises was placed in my
perusal, by a friend who knew
for some considerable time a
INDIGESTION and DEBILITY. _
ing its contents and noting the various tributes to
its efficacy, I resolved to give it a trial, and I now
feel most happy to state that, after a course of six
bottles, I am thoroughly cured of my distressin"-
ailments. My HEALTH IS Al, my appetite
good, my strength has come back, and I enjoy
sound sleep at night, instead of the restless, dis-
ordered slumber that previously was my lot. I
write this for the guidance and benefit of sufferers
from my old complaints, and think it my duty to
publicly acknowledge the great good that
MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE has done
for me. - i

In tho Train—Melbourne to Richmond.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the city work is over and you board the
train for home,
And you’re weary of your paper ere you have
the news begun,
And you look from out the window—flashing
gable, post and dome —
Suddenly a little clearing shows you glimpses of
the sun
Setting on the western land-rim, and you feel a
thrill of pain
At that glimpse of country skyline from the
swiftly-moving train.
Wo are used to city struggles, and we reck not of
the plain,
Till the sunset sky-line brings us dreamings of
the land we knew ;
Till the nightfall shows us, guarding entrance to
the land of rain,
That grey veil of plain and summer sacred unto
me and you.
Oh ! we curse our town existence, and we cry for
hill and plain,
When we see a glimpse of sky-line from the
swiftly-moving train.
One time we were used to pack our swags when
town began to pall,
With the spring we sot onr faces north or west-
ward—Bourke or Hay—
With the spring we struck out blithely to the
leaves that never fall;
Struck out whetlier “broke” or “banker” —
youth would always find a way.
Now we’re old, and dull, ami settled, and we’re
frightened of the rain ;
But we think of all its glories in the swiftly-
moving train.
Then, ah then! we had no children, no invest-
ments, and no wife;
We were used to striking outward at the burst-
ing of the leaf,
And the rumble of the wool-dray made us ifcoh for
the old life,
And we had another bush-ache with the sight of
every sheaf.
And now we only grumble, and bend honest to
our yokes—
For we’ve taken an incumbrance, and we’ve got
increasing folks-
Oh ! the wild, the futile longing We old bushmeil
seem to feel
When the spring brings to our nostrils all the
bush scents once we knew,
Or the sound of rapid horsehoofs, or the grinding
of a wheel,
Or the breath of blackwood blossoms scenting
air, and earth, and dew ;
And we hide the memories deeply, and we turn
from them in pain
When a glimpse of sky-line brings them in the
swiftly-moving train.
How we hunger for the winter of the bush and of
the flood,
When we rode the deluged plain girth-deep and
swam the creeks in scorn ;
When God had made no ice-wind but had failed
to chill our blood,
When we drank deep till the midnight and were
up and straight at dawn.
And now, at seven, we’re dozing, and at eight we
doze again,
As we’re dozing o’er the sky line in this swiftly-
moving train.
And we’re dreaming of the bnshland that the sky-
line hides from view—
The bushland in the glorious golden summer of
the west —
When the earth’s a flash of crimson and the sky a
dome of blue,
And the sun a burning jewel that sinks flaming
to its rest.
Gliding softly down a sapphire arch to vanish in
the plain
That lies beyond the sky seen from this swiftly-
moving train.
We are old, but not forgetful. Oh! dear bush-
land, you we greet I
Though you gave us griefs, bush sorrows have
more joy than city joys.
We were men you ’yond that skyline in the dear,
dead days would meet,
In this stony-hearted city we ate only reasoning
toys.
But perhaps beyond the sky-line of the grave we’re
men again—
Men who’ll always flee the city and its swiftly-
moving train.

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Only two Yankee ships last year, and
only 171 French, passed through the Suez Oaiial;
German, 292; English, 2581.
A recent Chinese paper, the Shenpao,
alluding to the examination of a coolie witness in
the recent case of the murder of two Swedish
missionaries at Sungpee, says :—“ At the order of
His Excellency Li he has been arrested, tortured
and beaten, and now has had an iron passed
through his collar-bone and riveted to a chain.”
A French railway-man has been fined oOfr*
for habitually locking-up his wife in a big trunk-
The trunk had a grating in the lid for the admis-
sion of air, and the lady was locked in this
receptacle when her husband went to his work,
and only released when he came home. It trans-
pired that, finding she had gone astray with the
other fellow, her husband offered her the alterna-
tive of being divorced, or being fastened in the
trunk, as a guarantee of good faith, whenever he
was absent, and only turned loose when he was at
home to keep an eye on her. She chose the trunk,
and had spent all her spare time in it for weeks
before the police heard of it. The strangest part
of the-story is that she expressed herself satisfied
witli the arrangement.
Walter Besant’s hero, Dittmer Bock, the
young German who wrote letters in five or
«ix languages for a commercial house at d£4o a
year, was not fiction, but hard, impecunious
reality. Says Manchester Clarion
A certain foreign shipping house in Leeds used to
employ foreigners as correspondents. A French and
German one at 15s. a week, and a French, Spanish, and
German one at 14s. The case of a young German was
I trough! under my notice the other day. He has been in
England about two years. He speaks good English, and
knows German, Italian, and French, but had no office
experience. Ho applied for a situation at Liverpool as
correspondent, and was offered 12s. a week on condition
that lie commenced to learn Danish. He didn’t take the
situation. A “ young German ” who could refuse a good
Job like that is apparently a hopeless case.

How seldom women embezzle !
Every officer in the Bank of Brazil at

“A person who socially is nothing is
thought less of by people who are not much than
by those who are a great deal.”— T. Hardy.
A Vic. country publican, charged with
selling adulterated liquor, pleaded that the

Unluckily for him, the Bench was not composed
of squatters.
A “ loyal ” paper discovers that the Duke
of York “intends to devote himself to the breed-
ing of Berkshire pigs.” If a fair sample of the
Guelphs, His Nibs has just about brains enough to
let pig-nature take its course.
David Wilson, travelling dairy expert for
Vic. Government, tells how he saw in Sweden
“some of the finest women in the world, 41 in a
row, working on their knees from 6 a.m. until
0 p.m, for the paltry wage of 6d.”
The S.A. Botanical Gardens began to dis-
tribute cork trees gratuitously in 18G4, and since
then, in conjunction with the Forest Department,
tens of thousands of useful trees of various kinds
have been freely given to land-owners.
A comic political duet is “ knocking ’em ”
in English ’alls. The chorus consists in the
simultaneous singing of the National Anathema
and “The Wearing of the Green.” It is called
“The Union,” and is just as discordant.
‘‘David and Bathsheba, a Royal Romance,’
is a recent addition to Goshcnic literature, visible
at the religious book warehouses. A glance into
it shows the extraordinary moral obliquity of these
people. Nothing can be more apparent to a
healthy mind than that David’s adultery led to
the national downfall.
Queenslander musical critic; “We all
remember Mr. Jude’s last magnificent organ re-
cital in Brisbane. A breathless silence held the
audience enchained,” &c.
Rude rooks and beasts old Orpheus swayed
Whene’er Iris lyre be strung ;
But Jude did more, far more—he made
Sweet woman hold her tongue.
Lord Ffrench, the oldest Irish peer in the
House, promised to support the Home Rule Bill.
This respectable Tory, by birth and hereditary
property, lives on the soil, and thinks that
“Home Rule will promote the prosperity of
Ireland,” The Irish lord who thinks otherwise
has generally been living in England all his life,
and swearing from afar off at the people who
didn’t pay the rent.
A late issue of Printers’ Ink (San Fran-
cisco) states that there are 13 women compositors
on the local Evening Bulletin and Call, three
on the Chronicle, two on the Post, and three on
the Examiner. In book, job, and weekly offices
in the same city there are 26, and in other offices
85, all being members of the Typographical
Union.
Abel Heywood, of Manchester, died the
other day. Heywood was the father of untaxed
newspapers. In days of yore he brought out a
paper without the Government stamp, wrote and
lectured against the stamp, and was brought to
insolvency and a dungeon cell for his pains. His
example inspired weaker creatures to shout for a
repeal of the newspaper duty, and the old abuse
knocked under to public opinion. Subsequently
Heywood became Mayor of Manchester. Some
of his spirit was introduced into the city, and
found durable expression in statues to Oliver

SOME DO, DON’T.
The majority do, the minority don't. The large-brained, level-headed folks do, the others don’t. Those who
itudy their best interests do, those who neglect them don’t. Of course there will always be a minority who
persistently avoid doing the right, and, of course, the members of that minority must pay for their own back-
sliding. They “ backslide ” with their eyes open, the evil they work upon themselves is continually being pointed
out to them and yet they continue on their downward career. The case in point is a simple one, a mere matter
of £s. d., of the value of the circulating medium, and w hat you can get for the money you have to spend. There's
no sentiment about it, it is of the earth earthy, it’s bound up in worldliness, and yet it’s a matter of as much
importance as half the things that are preached from stump and pulpit and platform from year’s end to year’s end.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
October 11, 1893.
My Dear Moorabinda—
It was lately advertised that there would not
be a cookery-demonstration on such and such a
day at Sydney School of Arts. I don’t wonder
at it! Cookery-demonstrations just now are
more like “eight-o'clock rushes” than sober
gatherings of matrons come to study the eggs v.
soda question. Only a few earnest disciples seek
Soyerian light at the cookery shows, which are
simply taken charge of by hordes of rapacious
women and their children, who sit as far in front
as they can get, and “ wolf” the samples as they
are brought round, without even simulating the
faintest curiosity as to whether you cut the paste
on the bias to produce the puff, or just keep on
pounding it with a pick-axe.
I have heard of ladies taking vice-regal recep-
tions as a good opportunity to achieve free tea
after shopping, but these economists are as infre-
quent as olive-blossoms compared to the ravenous
women who, just for the chewsomeness of the
thing, and with no desire whatever to learn why a
well-regulated chop won’t fry in its own fat, get
early seats when So-and-So’s gas-stove is adver-
tised to roast steadily from two till six. Atone
demonstration, a woman, backed by several
infants, fought her way gamely to the front, and
recognising a friend who was reaching out for her
tenth tartlet, said in a loud and reproachful
voice: “ Here’s me and my children been fastin’
since two o'clock, Mrs. Blank !”
You can arrange women in Leagues, but you
cannot make them agree. “ A Woman,” writing
about the Sydney Women’s Suffrage League in
the daily press, talks of “ the presence of a strong
urider-enrrent of ill-feeling and the absence of any
real unity between certain members.”
But that always is the difficulty with my dear
fellow-women —excessive lack of esprit de corps.
“If three women were on a desert island, two
would get into a corner and talk about the other
one,” says somebody who evidently knew his
book ; and similarly, if 20 get together in a con
federacy, yon have the same effect multiplied.
And I don’t blame women for it, either—it is so
very natural. The W.C.T.IJ. tabbies may stand
hojdmg hands and singing hymns for a week on
end, and the Suffragists may try to make things
appear as if woman’s looked-for political Messiah
was wanted to arrive in corsets and a frilled para-
sol, but it won’t do. Woman is a traitor to her
sex all along the line—from the society madame
who droops an eyelid just at the right moment
when Mr. So-and-So enters the room, to the crude
suburban girl who savagely tells her partner that
the dress he admires on somebody cost tuppence a
yard.
When you have hordes of females joining to-
gether with something like an approach to the
entente cordiale generally to be observed among
men, and not pooh-poohing the motion of member
So-and-So simply because she has a becontpng
bonnet on, then the Great Cause of Woman (I
haven’t the faintest idea what it is) may prosper,
but at present there isn’t one woman in a baker’s
dozen of ’em who wouldn’t rather be ordered
about by a man of her own choosing than taught
how to snap her fingers at him by the sweetest
angel who ever put powder on her nose.
For there are such depths of gullibility in a man
where a woman is concerned ; while she is an
sternal riddle to him, and if she’s at all clever she
san play him like a fish. But a woman reads a
woman from her boots to her bonnet-strings as if
she were the alphabet on French heels. And she
lets her know it, too.
Women of nous don’t want the suffrage. They
despise men too much to want it.
A description of the marriage of Miss “Di.”
Davis, a daughter of Rabbi Davis, of Sydney, to
Mr. Randolph Benjamin, of Melbourne, occupied
;wo columns of a Sydney paper, which gave an
exhaustive list of the presents. But in so bur-
glarious an epoch, it is hardly wise to print an
nventory of your Teraphim as a catalogue for
Bill Sikes. If you advertise that you have a
dozen golden egg-spoons, is it likely that Bill will
go away satisfied with second-best plate? Which
query applies equally well to the trusting public
announcement that the young couple possess a
solid silver tea-pot, and that all their forks are
Hall-marked.
An enthusiastic N.S.W cleric intends, I see,
forming a “Young Woman’s Society’’—pledged
to marry no man if he drinks —in the ambiguous
language of the popular Temperance song which
seems to infer that the very best brands of mas-
culinity are constructed on the rabbit principle.
But if the Y.W.S. comes off, somebody ought
really to start a Young Man’s Society on the
same basis, since a weakness for strong waters
isn’t an absolutely unknown failing with lovely
woman.
But, after all, I don’t see the good of a Young
Men’s Society pledged to connubialize with Blue
Ribbon damsels only, because it wouldn’t be a
safeguard. A medicine-man once told me that the
number of teetotal girls who assumed a friendly
attitude towards bottled beer ill a surprisingly
short time after marriage was legion, so it’s rather
puzzling to know how a man can guard against
alcoholic risks in matrimony.
The bridegroom who does the magnet aot—l
mean the man who attracts his bride across the
seas, instead of fetching her himself, runs many
risks from be-buttoned sea-dogs and others.
But even the who coaches her way to
matrimony may never reach her destination in her
spinster capacity—unless she hits on a coaching
company who won’t allow ladies on the box.
An old coach-driver was, the other day, gar-
rulous on the subject of box-seat ladies. He told
how years ago he brought a squatter’s bride up to
the matrimonial scratch, and on the way she grew
weary and dozed off with her little head peacefully
and unconsciously nestling into his coat-collar all
through the starlit night. “Ah, a good many o’
’em ’as made a pillar o’ me,” said he with a wink
which seemed to infer that he rather liked it.
Talking about a certain coaching-manager’s
stern rule not to allow petticoats on the
front seat, I am told that a sporting young
lady well - known in Sydney society gob
through on the box despite the misogynis-
tic embargo. The whip (had been in “ pa’s
employ, you know,” so when Miss presented her-
self in the indistinct dawn in a covert coat and a
slouch felt hat he risked it, and let her up. On
the way—at the “change horses” —she enhanced
the situation by blowing cigarettes ! She tells the
story herself—with relish.
A certain lordling, aide-de-camp in a Western
gubernatorial establishment, whose engagement
to an English woman was announced some
time ago, has for a while past been paying
marked attention to the daughter of a well-known
more or less literary Lady. The Guv. remonstrated
with the aforesaid lordling, who promised to
amend his ways, but at the next ball he went the
pace faster than ever. The Guv. brought mamma
on the scene of his flirtation and told her that the
fascinator was already engaged. Mamma waxed
furious, turned her back on .vice-royalty, and
marched her daughter home without a word. The
attendants have now got orders to receive neither
mother nor daughter in future for insulting Her
Majesty’s representative!
The Palmer-Beaumont co.’s first concert at
Sydney Town Hall last week was mostly a fight
with echoes, of the past and otherwise. It made
you think of a vocal “maze” —one person chort-
ling sounded like a full band of him, in the roof.
But ’twas ever thus—unless the vast civic palace
of entertainment is S.R.O. the most fetching
vocalist produces the impression of somebody
shrieking in an empty tank.
Methought there was a soent of withered laurel
about' the concert—a sort of John Toole-ishness
—Mrs. Palmer (Rosina Carandini), who sang in
spectacles, and Armes Beaumont, though he re-
mains as glossy as the raven’s tail, largely con-
tributing to that impression. Mr. Gee (a good-
billing name in a horsey country) sang with a very
crudenotion of taperinglightandshade—sometimes
you wanted an ear-trumpet, and sometimes cotton-
wool—but he can throw so much mourning-coach-
like misery into his full baritone that his “ Thou’rt
Passing Hence ” was made a very artistic item.
Miss Sterling (she should alter the nom-de-theatre,
if she wants to have any musical luck in Austra-
lia) sang a difficult aria from Rossini in a faithful
way—something like a very prize student in her
agony—but her rendering of “ Were I the River ”
proved her to have a very pretty notion of bal-
ladising, which, so far, seems strongly her forte.
Lemmone, looking more like Cecil Ward than
ever, tootled in his very best manner, and Barker,
harping on his harp, completed the caste.
Any woman who wants to experience the ex-
quisite pleasure of seeing herself in a variety of
aspects at one blow, or who wishes to taste the
infrequent joy of gazing without any trouble at
all upon her back view, ought to positively haunt
“ The Maze ”at Sydney Strand. Apart from the
wonderfulness of the of
multiplied reflection, the fact that it is possible to
appreciate how your figure looks from every
point of view without doubling yourself up with
hand-mirrors is enough to make “The Maze” an
all-round institution—for I don’t suppose men are
absolutely indifferent as to how they look en
profile , either. For a golden opportunity of seeing
yourself as others see you, I don’t think you could
improve upon “The Maze.”
The eagerness with which the married men
urge a bachelOr-tax is suggest!va They prize
their lost liberty so highly that they wish to
charge their-unlimed fellows so much per annum
for their freedom. The amusing part of the
married versus single arguments is always Bene-
diet’s hotness against the bachelors, whom he calls
“selfish and useless fools,” “scamps who spend
their money on riotous living and infamy, ’’ with
the warmth of langu age that generally denotes
the weaker side of the argument—this while the
attitude of the opposing celibates is unmistakably
tinged with complacent pity for the much-billed
house father who implores vengeance of the tax-
gatherer upon him who refuses to “give away
half his victuals to get the other half cooked.”
But many women will fervently hope that the
State refuses to tax the unmarried male. If it
weren’t for the bachelors, what on earth would the
married women do?
A second visit to “Dorothy” (by the way,
whenever you go you unearth a prima-clonna in a
stage-box, twirling a pink rose-bud, and keeping
a sharp eye out for wrinkles) is a pleasant experi-
ence, even if you do discover that the all-con-
quering Nellie speaks of her apparel as “close,”
and doesn’t seem aware that at least two of her
garments are absolutely shrieking for twelve
inches of tucker in the front. Florence Young
sported a rather good-looking white satin, with
mauve plumes, in the hall scene, and her patches
were cleverly stuck on. But neither of the ladies
had thought to put a patch where the shapely
Isabel Urquhart used to gum the sticking-plaster
with electric effect —about half-a-hand below the
collar-bone. You thought it was a smudge until
the opera-glasses were steadily focussed —that was
the artful part of it.
The sanctimonious newspaper-correspondence
about the immorality of raffling at church-bazaars
amuses me. “How many thousands have been
ruined hereby, each one led to take the first step
downwards !” —because they gave a shilling or so
to get rid of an importunate bazaar-tout who
assailed them with a pair of pea-green-and-purple
slippers or a baby’s bonnet with rosettes over
the ears? To my mind, the bazaar-raffle is the
most salutary start an incipient plunger could
possibly make. The memory that once upon a
time, in a hot room, smelling of dead gum-leaves
and crowded with badly-painted girls, he put a
florin in the slot and was publicly hailed as the
triumphant winner of an embroidered flannel
petticoat is enough to make him turn to goose-
flesh at the mere mention of lotteries for the rest
of his natural life.
The “ Niobe ” Gavotte, by T. H. Massejr, and
dedicated to Mrs. Robert Brough (whose picture
in the .robes of the wife of Amphion adorns the
cover) is a somewhat spidery composition of the
simplest design possible, and quite devoid of the
stately rhythm you look for in gavotte music. It
would make a very danceable schottische, though,
and people who play it would do well to strictly
regard it as Such.
I sincerely hope the military tournament, to
commence at Sydney Agricultural Society’s
grounds to-day (Thursday), will be thickly patro-
nised, because the officers who promoted the
affair have undertaken to hand any profits to the
hospitals, and to pay any deficiency out of their
own pockets should the show hot cover expenses.
The most artistic garment in a wonderfully-
staged revival of “ In the Ranks,” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, was certainly the brown velvet shoot:
ing-coat sported hy George Henry Vee in the first
act. Pretty Hilda Spong, as the distracted
heroine, wore a white satin bridal dress with a
court train in the second act, but I couldn’t help .
thinking how fortunate it Was that she had
got a sober brown frock in her trousseau
just the very garment that every heroine setems to
have when circumstances are dead against the hero.
The bold, bad man, Mr. Norman, looked very like •
a fashionable Sydney medico when he got his top-
hat on, and Kate Bishop, as Mrs. Buzzard, put so
much comedy into the part that I quite forgot to
notice how she dressed it. The one incongruity
of the show was the boughs of Australian gum-
tree with which the faithful English yokels had
decorated the family church.
A Parisian actress lately hit upon a new and
original plan of personal advt.—far beyond the
stplen-jewellery scheme —that merits the careful
attention of all unattached Thespiennes whose
laurels want rewatering. Firstly, she got married
and “ivll went well” till the day’s festivities oame
to a close, and the bride withdrew to her salon.
This room had a secret door into the street by
which she escaped, leaving the bridegroom
planted there. Next day there came to the poor
man a letter “positively refusing to join him.”
An ingenious and characteristic bit of theatrical
advertising ! But, after all, an actress who was
quite willing to live with her husband would be
a far greater draw as a notoriety than an actress
who wasn’t. What do you think ?
The great servant question deserves Madame
Sterling’s attention. According to a speaker at a
recent meeting of the Sydney Church Home, (a
very funny story is told about the vice-regal atti-
tude towards the collection-plate on that occasion),
theM was “an abnormally large proportion of
domestic servants among the unfortunate class of
Sydney.” It is complained that “ the average
mistress lacks sympathy with her serf and keeps
the great gulf of social difference so sharply
defined that the hireling at last loses confidence
in her own moral value and the rest is easy.”
The manner in which this absence of sympathy
between mistress and maid is said to operate is
that the latter “ looks upon it as her greatest
pleasure to escape temporarily from her unattrac-
tive environment” —another way of saying that
Bridget hungers for her Sunday-out. But lam
afraid a mistress would need a regular ooean of
sympathy to make Bridget see the dangers of that
sentiment.
As a matter of fact, if the domestic servant
trips by the way oftener than any other class the
great reason is that there are more women in
service than in any other occupation, and also
because the average servant-girl is a very lonely
being in the land where nine families out of ten
employ but one mercenary to assist in the
domestic warfare. The most feeling mistress in
the world can’t be expected to join in the ginger-
beery joys of her perfect treasure’s Sunday-out,
and the result is that the treasure picks up her
boon companions as she goes, with varied success,
of course. If mistresses are to be altogether
blamed for the moral mistakes of their helps the
matron who really wishes to do her duty by her
white slave ought to let her out attached to a
rope, worked on the principle of a fishing-line,
and then haul her in at uncertain intervals to see
how she’s behaving herself.
A British medico graphically describes the
horrors of tea-drinking (no need to go to Britain—
you should just read the pronouncement on the sub-
ject by Dr. Knaggs, of Sydney). It creates, he says,
a tendency in women to usurp the bread-winning
functions of man, and the result of such brain-
stimulation, he prophesies, will be the disappear-
ance of teeth among our grateful great-grand-
children.
On this theory, tannin has already begun to tell
in Australia, where the tea-pot is never “ off.’*
The usurping tendency is shown in the Women’s
Suffrage spasms, and, as for the other pro*
position, everybody who has ever done the
Block intelligently will treat it with res-
pect. Half the women you meet either
grin at you with long, false fangs, the wrong
match for their complexion (I saw a yellow woman
with a mouthful of bright-blue porcelain the other
day), or glitter with gold stoppages like the seams
on rich quartz, or whistle at you through gummy
gaps ; and I have seen the very smallest children
compatible with vanished milk-teeth, behaving
like seasoned habitues in the dentist’s ether-
scented chair. And tea is the foul fiend which is
ruining us soul and gums !
This really happened at the last Govmentouse
hop, when a fashionably-dressed dame and her
cavalier were standing on and off the supper-table.
“Do you like French wines ? ” said he. “ Oh, not
at all! ” said she with a move of disgust, “ they’re
so thin, you know. I only drink champagne ! ”
Under the heading of “ Accident to a Countess,”
it is cabled that Lady Huntingdon broke her
collar-bone while hunting. The fractured lady is
of Australian origin, being a daughter of Sir
Samuel Wilson, which may be the reason why her
broken clavicle is thrust upon the Australian
public, though probably the fact that she is a
“countess” is sufficient excuse. Sometimes it
seems as if the cableman were a duke of the
deepest dye—he has such a guileless way of agitat-
ing miles of wire when an unheard-of aristocrat
eats something that disagrees with him, or falls
off his geegee when the animal kicks at a fly.
I see that an English jury has awarded a lady
"£4O, by way of compensation against a dentist
who, under the pretext of extracting one aching
troubler, gave her ether, pulled out every tooth
from her head, and calmly remarked : “You will
be better when you get a new set.”
Which reminds me that a certain Australian
firm of dentists which brags about its cheap ad-
ministration of gas makes all sorts of objections
when a nervous lady-client conics along and de-
mands to be anaesthetised on the moderate scale
advertised. The good-looking operator generally
induces his victim to submit to what is alleged to
be a cocaine spray, but you should just hear the
howl when the “ drag ” is on.
The dignified luminaries of a Bavatarian police-
court were rather startled recently at receiving
gorgequsly-gotten-iip 6x4 cards, having the honour
to invite Mr. and Mrs. Horsehair to the wedding
of the daughter of the lady who swept out the
court. As the enterprising hostess was an old
and respected char-lady, who always swept behind
the door, legal society (they were all asked, from
the P.M. downwards) decided to go en e/arcon, as
a mark of gratitude for the absence of cobwebs in
the witness-box for something like half a century,
and go they did, with but one,exception.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Editor Bulletin, —The only man who

Any third candidate who polls any reasonable

Morgan and put in Burdekin. There is no chance
for a Democrat in the Hawkesbury district, where
money is the only measure of merit. The sight at

Editor Bulletin,— The miserable, slow
torture which Messrs. Wm. Crane and A.

under the large and aspiring title of the
“Australian Chess Championship,” is a shock-
ing imputation upon Australian chess ability
generally. Nothing above a fifth-rate game has
yet come out of the present contest, whose prir-
oipal characteristic is a timid massacre by “ man-
ning,” as if each player dreaded that his opponent
was a doughty “ dark horse,” with unknown com-
binations behind the most innocent move-
ments, and as if a clear board, with equal
opposing remnants, was an absolute neces-
sity. The whole combat has been opiatic—
no dash, no strategy; commonplace ana trans-
parent combinations; a perfect mania for settling
every prospect of a feint by “ piece for piece,”
often without even the “advantage of the ex-
change^’and hardly ever with any real gain by
“ position ; ” a dreary show of sluggish orthodoxy
that must positively sicken live chess-players;
with here and there the most awful schoolboyish
errors. And this mediocre fizzle is going forth to
the world as Australian championship chess ! The
one thing more sickening than the play has been
Hie babyish commenting babble of the Sydney
press.--* ‘

My Love of Moerakl.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I was self-banished to Maoriland and
wanted to vex my Australian girl in Melbourne.
I call her “ my girl ” because she wouldn’t have
me.
I had heard of lots of fellows picking up good-
looking Maori or half-caste girls “with pro-
perty.” To marry such a one would be sweet
revenge. Hear the tale of luck.
• # «
I got a Job at the Moeraki, in Otago,
helping her .father to catch groper for the Dunedin
market. I had the privilege frequently of the
young lady’s company. Somehow, I liked her
best “to leeward.” I did not admire her taste in
tobacco.
Something of this indifference must have
dawned on her one day, when, after mending a
net in her presence during a two-hours’ solemn
silence on my part, she stole away, carrying with
her my watch, tobacco, and empty purse. But
she wasn’t a thief. She handed the articles to
her father, who formally returned them, with a
neat little speech.
“ Now, you stop with me. My girl fine young
woman. You marry her.”
I was embarrassed. So I bluffed it off with—
“ You’re only poking fun. I’m only a poor
devil.”
“No fear. No fun. You dam good man.”
“ Albright; we’ll see about it by-and-by.”
• # *
Next evening my dusky darling strolled
along the beach past my door—a vision of native
splendour. Her profuse and oily looks flowed
over her back. She wore a scarlet cloak over a
striped red-and-yellow skirt, hitched up at one
side to display her bright, blue stockings and
patent-leather shoes with huge, glittering buckles
She “ had ’em alt on.”
I steeled my heart. I shut myself up till she
was some distance away, and then skedaddled to
the railway-station to see the train pass—the one
excitement of the place.
When I came back my door was open. On the
floor before the fire sat my rainbow beauty. She
roiled her ox-eyes towards me reproachfully and
tenderly.
“ Hullo, Kitty?”
She arose, placed her massive arms around my
shoulders and sank her huge glistening head on
my chest.
“ Hullo ! What’s up, old girl ? ”
“I’m not old—only 18 year. I love you. You
marry me.”
Her nicotian breath steamed into my nostrils.
With uplifted chin, I gazed at the rafters and
raupo thatch. The world became all rancid fab,
ancient barracoota, over-ripe dried shark, and
Maori maiden. Heavy on my heart lay the past;
heavier on my chest lay the present, with its
gurgle of, “You love me, eh ? You love me ? ”
I don't very clearly remember the rest.
I have a dim recollection of hearing the door
shut, and of seeing the red-and-yellow stripes
hung up on a nail; next, of a wild rush into
liberty and the salt air, with a voice yelling behind
me—
“ You don’t love me ? . . . Oh, come back
and love me ! . . . Oh, you (Maori word) pig!
My father will (a lot of expressive Maori words)
you in the morning.”
I didn’t wait at Moeraki for the morning.

Professor Rentoul, of Melbourne, 'i yclines
to accept the theory that “ the beautitv' child,
and the vermin which crawls on the hail ftf the
neglected child, come from the same origin.' - He
thinks that “ it is a dirty theory at the best, and
could be made more dirty.” Let us hear what the
insect in question has to say about this matter :
I'm a simple little vermin
With a calm poetic crawl ;
And the marquis in his ermine,
Or the duchess in her shawl,
Are not fit to hold a candle
To the creature they despise ;
Whilst the babies that they dandle
Seem as wicked—for their size.
Can a scientist determine
From the rubbish he has read,
That a simple little vermin
In a gutter-urchin’s head
Is a baser thing, or meaner,
Than a king who uses soap?
Sure it always comes out cleaner
Underneath the microscope.
I'm a simple little vermin,
I begin and end in dust;
My life is one long sermin
On the Falsehood of “ Disgust,"
I’ve been taught to look on clothing
As the sign of Man’s disgrace,
And my bite betokens loathing
For the dirty human race.
Of fraud you find no germ in
Little customers like us ;
To talk of “land-boom vermin "
Is absurdity, or wuss.
You have men in Parliament who’ll
Never blush to tell a lie.
Right you are ! Professor Rentoul—
That's a dirty theo-ry.

Among the side-shows of OhiCcigo Jiixhibi-
tion in its opening days was a convent ion of
w. men who wanted to wear pants. There were
all sorts of costumes present, and one Bloomer
after another hupped on a table to show off her
tail-coat and her latest idea in divided skirts, and
delivered an impassioned harangue about her
ankles and other purely personal matters. At
last a lady-journalist broke up the show. She
addressed the president :
“ Look here, madam, I am not very strong physically ;
I have a headache, and I m all tired out, but if yon cross
my vision again to-day I shall fall upon yon tooth and
nail and efface you as I would a fly 1 I h >ve home much,
and I can bear more, hut the sight of another matron with
a large waist, a short dress, and piano-leg calves, will
change me from a woman into a fiend.”
Then the convention girded up its abbreviated
skirt and left.
The Carcoar tragedy has aroused the usual
assemblage of cranks who want in future to have
all country bank-managers clad in mail and sur-
rounded by impregnable fortifications—quite for-
getting that, on the principle that the lightning
doesn’t strike twice in the same place, a hank-
manager might now sleep unarmed on the front-
doorstep with impunity. The most remarkable
crank of the lot, one “ C. Griffin,” suggests in the
Herald that every inmate of a bank should go in
for revolver-practice- and probably pot all his or
her relatives by accident; and that gongs and fire-
alarms should be rigged up—so that the banker’s
infant can play with the handle and arouse
the neighbourhood periodically. Also ;
The keys of the bank safe should never be on the
premises, nor should it be known that the teller(who may
live away from the bank) holds them. Where there are
two or three banks in a town, each manager might hold
and secrete the keys of the safe of a neighbouring bank—
if there are three or more changing about, so that none
but the managers themselves, or their trusted servants,
might know where the keys were on any given night.
Then some enterprising manager would come in
and burgle his rival’s safe, or else—worse still—
he would enter in the dead of night and audit his
accounts, and discover the shortage. There are
worse things in the bright lexicon of banking than
even midnight assassination. Besides, is it any
more agreeable to be killed by the man who wants
the keys of the other bank, than by the one who
wants the keys of your own bank ?
Extract from the private letter of a trades-
man at Geraldton, Johnstone River (N.Q.), to an
old mate who, six months ago, travelled to Sydney
for medical advice
I am just dragging through life myself, making suffi-
cient to keep myself and family in tucker, and barely
that sometimes. ‘ . . . Things up here are dreadful;
fciiere is absolutely nothing doing. I expect every year
the sugar industry will be getting worse, for the planters
have brought in a lot of Javanese, and now they are
importing Japanese, who are, so far as I can see, better
skilled in fine work than Europeans, and who will work
for a few pence per day. And they are doing everything
about the mills ; they are not restricted, like Kanakas, to
field-work aione. Goondi is swarming with these races,
and I venture to say that, some time or other on the
Johnstone, we shall have to defend ourselves with the
rifle, for they are here in such numbers that they could
dictate any terms they chose if they took it in their
heads. . . . Should Towalla not go ahead, in another
12 months there will be no one here but Chinese and
coloured labour.

There are engaged in the N.W. pearl fisheries
149 vessels (total tonnage, 2583 tons) and 110*

discussion on the annual subsidy paid
to the Vic. Parliament refreshment contractor
has thrown some new and beautiful light on the
inner working of the senatorial pub. Premier
Patterson remarked that “for 32 years, Mr.
Gregory, the caterer, was paid ±(525 a year, and
finally was voted ±l5OO for the losses he had sus-
tained. The fact was that members were so
temperate in their habits that the refreshment-
rooms were a losing concern.” Evidently the
country lost ±21,500 in 32 years, apart from the
ruin brought upon the caterer. But in the oause
of total (or nearly total) abstinence the money wai
nobly spent :
Now, fie I upon the evil-minded praters,
The scandal-making praters,
Of unsober legislators
Addicted to refreshments at the bar.

For no one has an appetite for dinner,
And the restaurant’s conducted at a loss,

Small mutton chop I they whisper to the waiters,
All in vain the weary waiters

The British Humourists.
Dear Bulletin, — Apropos your recent
article on “ Tlie British Humourists.” Tell me,
where is humour bred ? Thus fur, you have only
pointed out the places where one ought not to
■mile. “ The Englishman is not built for humour
—the Scot is not funny, and lie realises the fact—
the Irishman also doesn’t take kindly to humorous
journalism, chiefly because his fun is of the un-
conscious description.” That disposes of the
United Kingdom of G.B. and I.’s pretentions to
manufacture mirth. Is a groper in the darkness
to understand, then, that humour is an unknown
quantity in every English-spoken country, or that
it springs only from the soil of America, Canada,
Australia, and other places described as “British
possessions”? Hoes humour expressed in English
ever appear in print, or upon the stage, and, if so,
where ? And if no person born into the language
of cockney Milton ever was, is, or can be, a
humourist, then which English writer is entitled
to swear to the fact? Inasmuch as a jour-
nalist avowedly destitute of sense of humour
could not recognise the article if he saw
it, the writer of your article must be an
American, Canuck, Australian, “ Colonial,” or
something “foreign, 1 ' from a Frenchman down
to a Chinese. He knows much, or all, about
were I not English, I would venture to
call him a humourist by his writing. Let him
divulge his knowledge. Put him in the witness-
box that a dull dog of a Saxon may cross-examine
mm. Lay him flat upon his solemn oath and sit
upon his stomach so that he can’t wriggle.
Now then, Bulletin Expert, what do you mean
by saying that “Toole, a more or less Irish
gentleman, whose humour has been carefully
adapted to cockney tastes, is the living symbol of
the whole race ? ” Toole exists mainly upon a
decrepit reputation in the provinces. Are you
that Toole’s Theatre (smaller even than
Terry’s Theatre) is the smallest house in London,
and that for years he has been generally unable to
keep it filled? Why do you affirm that the
humour of this old-fashioned performer has been
carefully adapted to cockney tastes? Were you
ever in London, and could you identify a genuine
cockney taste if you had it in your mouth ?
(No answer.)
Concerning humour. Is it fixed and immutable
or subject to change ? Were Shakespeare’s clowns
funny men once ? Would any country’s humour
of the 10th century be considered funny in the
same country to-day ?
E»ekt (conscientiously): I have my doubts.
Gaiety burlesque “ humour,” now ! Was is not
founded upon the patronage of “crutch and
toothpick” johnnies, and didn’t it gradually
decay as the old johnnies went bung and the
supply of new ditto diminished ? Is it not
practically played out in London, .even as a leg-
show ? But were the various Gaiety companies
not enormous successes in Australia, and wasn’t
the Australian youth the chief supporter of the
last lot ?
Exfkiit : Alas ! he was.
You say of Lonnen, “he has a certain coster
song which is supposed to be too joyful for ex-
pression because there is no ‘h ’in it.” Would it
be the faintest suggestion of a coster’s song if it
included an “ h.”
B.E. ; I suppose not.
Did you ever see a London coster, and are you
able to say that these songs (written by a French-
man) not seriously sentimental, rather than
B E ,C - No Conception ' wordB and melody ?
You say “British humour of the present day
consists largely of legs and a turning up of the
eyes to the gallery. • Ta-ra-ra-boora-de-ay ’is not
m itself any more amusing than the first chapter
of Genesis. Has not “Ta-ra-ra ” aforesaid been a
gorgeous success in America, France, Belgium,
Germany, Russia, and Turkey ? * ’
"■ E - : you’ve got me again.
P , a ‘ ra ‘ ra ” claim to be an exposition of
British humour, or a display of British legs under
new and original circumstances of music hall song?
B it. : Ask me an easier one.
If it is British humour, then in this particular
must n it 6 not r ? tlBh hUm ° Ur must be cos mopolitan,
(No answer.)
Granted that the English comic paper is
frequently, but not invariably, as dull, or duller,
than the comic papers of other countries—are you
prepared to stick to such wild assertions as
Bunchs rival, Fun, had never more than one
u uiJVj B composition” remembering that the
Bat) Ballads appeared in Fun ? Did you ever read
a Dutch comic paper, and, judging from Ibsen’s
plays, would you think that Northern Europe has
a powerful sense of humour?
B.E. : No—to all that lot.
Do you think that the duel could sur-
vive m a strictly “humorous” country? Do the
peculiarities of Italian opera (in which the prima
donna pulls the tenor out of his dungeon cell to
bow, and puts him back again before encoring the
duet) suggest that the fiery Italians are “ humor-
ists ! Is the Spanish bull-fight compatible with
a national appreciation of fun?
(At this stage defendant asked for a glass ofioater,
with a drop of something in it.)
Such modern English comedies as “The Magis-
trate’’and “Dandy Dick,” are they funny, and
y - I , > net w ith much success in England?
Did Our Boys ’ run for several years at a stretch,
and will you swear that H. J. Byron didn’t write
humorous burlesques as well as comedies?
(No answer.)
May we assume that you believe in the possi-
bility of English language humour, whilst denying
its existence in Great Britain and Ireland ? “
B.E. : For the sake of argument, you may.
Are the meat-teas of Australia not more produc-
tive of dyspepsia than of light humour ? Can you
name any humorous American comedies, comic
operas, or burlesques ? Have you ever wept over
Evangeline and its fat man? Does J. 0.
Williamson import his fellow-countrymen in pre-
ference to comedians like Fred. Marshall, Royce.
Elton, Brough, Thornton, Lauri (of an English
pantomime family), and others? Is nigger min-
strelsy the lowest and most conservative class of
th earth ! and dld Hingland invent
that/ Do Gilbert and Sullivan’s operas strike you
as being funnier than French opera bouffe? Did
you ever see a German comic opera and wish to
see it again? Do you think that the cockney
humour of Charles Dickens will outlive that of
the best of the living American wags? Was
Thackeray more humanly funny than Arternus
Ward . Jnnally, why did you write that article
in The Bulletin ?
B.E. : That you might crush me in your pon-
derous English manner. It was a put-up job to
show the paper’s broad-minded impartiality.
E.F.
The Coming Girl.
A well-known lady fashion-writer calls the
bicycle-girl a “foretaste” of the twentieth-century
girl:—“To-day—it’s a straddle or nothing.
Grandmamma’s advice has been thrown to the
winds.- Lovely woman has won her biggest
victory, for after the bicycle, what is there to set
metes and bounds to her progress ? Is not the
boundless universe hers now ? Is it the first time
a great question has been solved by a straddle,
either, mes bans?
“The poor men stand by with hands lifted up
in holy horror. The veriest roue, the most har-
dened worldling, catches his breath and blushes as
the bicycle girl flits by him, her trim ankles
glancing in the sunlight and her fine figure poised
in graceful equilibrium. He feels instinctively
that she is nearer the goal, that she is closer upon
his heels than ever ; that nothing will now satisfy
her until her chair is tilted, and her neat little
buttoned boots lined up with his patent-leathers
in the club window. Hence I ask : ‘After the
bicycle girl, what? And I ask it in all serious-
ness, for I consider that the bicycle girl is proof
that woman has firmly made up her mind to break
away absolutely and entirely from the ‘disabili-
ties’ which man has put upon her in his various
s ifr 11 , 168 keep tier in a condition of tutelage.
“ The bicycle girl is but a foretaste of woman as
she is to be in the middle of the next century.
“ lo grandmother’s advice- ‘Sit up straight,
don’t cross your legs, keep your knees together,’
now comes this response: ‘Bah ! rous m’ennuyez,
with your old-fashioned twaddle. From this rime
on, we women intend to use our minds and our
legs as we see fit. We have as much right to
straddle a wheel as you men have, and when
mounted thereon we don’t look any more ridi-
culous than you do ; in fact, messieurs, we make a
better showing than you do. But, messieurs, we
don t propose to stop here; we propose to do away
with the dangerous side-saddle and ride our horses
as we do our bikes—each leg where it will do most
good. We are what heaven hath made us, and we
see no reason for being ashamed of it.’
“‘By the middle of next century we shall
patronise the same tailor, the same shoemaker,
and the same hatter. Our underclothes will be
of the sajne style ; your shirts and ours will only
vary in size; we shall be able to lend each other a
collar or a tie, or a handkerchief, or a pair of
socks. Poudre de riz, cosmetics, and the corset
of to-day will be r’elegated to the keeping of the
attic store-room along with the ridiculous finery
of our grandmothers. We shall be, however,
neither minotaurs nor monsters, but healthy,
graceful, well-developed women, who will be just
as fond as ever of the pressure of that divine
circle, a good, stout, manly arm, and the exquisite
titillation of a pair of strong, ripe, wholesome
lips, pressed respectfully, devotedly, reverently,
and in rapturous parallel upon ours.
“ ‘But, messieurs, prenez garde, there must be
no more trifling, no further issuance of the false
tokens of love. Both sexes will stand exactly
upon the same level, and the emotional dissem-
bler, be he man or woman, will beclassed with the
forger and the counterfeiter, and the brand of
shame be set upon him or her. We shall be
harder to win, Init worth more when got; more
reasonable, more serviceable, more companionable,
more enjoyable. Between our attire and yours
there will be about as much difference as between
the plumage of the male and the fem de bird. Only
ours will be the gaudier and not yours, as
in the case of the birds. Wo shall have
no pleasures, no amusements, no recreations
except in common, and, although we shall not, as
did the Spanish women in the Middle Ages, make
use of plates of lead to flatten our busts, yet our
figures will most surely undergo a change; Juno
and Ceres will part with their plenitude of charm;
Venus surrender up her look of over-ripeness ;
Diana do a little banting, and Minerva grow
somewhat less in bust-measurement. i
“ ‘The successor to the bicycle girl, the middle
of next century girl, will be a delicious com-
pound of Hebe and Ganymede—the boy-woman,
with the eyes of a heifer and the voice of a con-
tralto, with the face of a gentle lad and.the limbs
of a female trapeze performer; with the teeth of a
young dog, the cheek of a peasant lass, and the
breath of a cow that has been nibbling wild
mignonette. When this happy day dawns the
ordinary love-songs of to-day will sound as ridicu-
lous as the tender passages of the “Song of
Solomon ” do to us now.
“ * And yet, messieurs, do not be solicitous, for
we shall be just as lovable as Juliet, just as kiss-
able_ as Kate, juss as adorable as Beatrice, just as
fascinating as Rosalind, just as entrancing as
Cleopatra, just as huggable as Cressida, who had
“language in her eye, her cheek, her lip—whose
very feet could talk.”
The Elixir of Beauty.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Fat women are not only better looking, but yoanger-
looking than their slim sisters. The advice I would give
a thin woman for wrinkles would be a two-word sentence,
‘Get Fat.’ And if a fat girl asked for advice I should
tell her to keep quiet. Women wear themselves out.”
This extract from somebody’s letter in some newspaper
or other, might be gracefully expressed in a drawing-
room song.
Go, pretty maiden, get you fat,
And witch us with your graces 1
O, emulate the parlour cat
Who purrs in cosy places.
The woman bent on looking fresh
And young at eight-and twenty
Must cultivate sufficient flesh
To suit the cognoscenti.
Chorus-
Go, pretty maid, be not afraid
Of cream in moderation :
A life of peace, with lots of grease.
Is beauty’s sure salvation.
Their praises to a scraggy waist
Let foolish fledglings stutter;
The man of more enlightened taste
Prefers you soft as butter.
A morbid, sentimental miss
Breaks often out in pimples,
But she who tempts the ardent kiss
Is dotted o’er with dimples.
Chorus.
Go, pretty maiden, laugh and sleep,
r Whilst sister Martha flurries ;
The lines upon her brow are deep
Because, alas ! she worries.
Contentment is the salve that gives
A smoothness to complexions,
And Phyllis, plump, forever lives
In Strephon’s fond affections.
Chorus.

An item from a recent Sydney Equity
Court report. A legal advt. required under
some Act or other had been inserted in the Aus-
tralian Star, and Judge Owen moralised
thereon
His Honor said he had seen the Star, but he confessed
he knew nothing about it. It was a very unusual tiling
to publish a notice of this kind in an evening paper,
especially in a paper that had only just been started.
He did not think it desirable that the advertisement
should appear in only one evening paper. He could not
imagine ttiat an evening paper had the same circulation
as either the Sydney Morning Herald or the Daily
Telegraph. People who looked for this kind of adver-
tisement were much more likely to look for it in the
other paper.
The Star has been about six or seven years in
existence, and Judge Owen “ knows nothing about
it,” and thinks that it has only just been started.
Truly, newspaper-making is heartbreaking work.
A newspaper, to be a success, has to make eve.ry
dull old fogy in the community aware of its being,
and unless it can catch a man like Mr. Owen, and
shut him in solitary confinement for six weeks, with
nothing but the Star to read, it takes forty years
before the existence of the journal begins to eat
through the lobster-shell of his consciousness. And
though everybody else is aware that the circula-
tion of an evening paper—other things being
equal—is generally twice as great as that of a
morning one, “ His Honor ’’can’t “imagine” such
a thing. For that matter, nobody ever asked him
to imagine it, for no one can imagine anything
without some imagination to do it with. Only
the public would naturally expect the old gentle-
man to know such a simple thing as that, and it
seems that he doesn’t.

A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On 15th March, 1791, the Gorgon man-of-
war, Captain John Parker, sailed from Spithead
for Port Jackson. Captain Parker took his wife
with him, and in June, 1795, there was published
in London “A Voyage round the World, performed
and written by Ids Widow, for the advantage of a
numerous Family”—a little book which is interest,
ing for more reasons than its connection with the
early history of N.S. Wales.
# * #
The writer appears to have been a woman
of that good old stamp which is being improved
off the face of the earth —homely, simple, and
affectionate, but with plenty of sense and spirit
besides. There is also about her way of expressing
herself a refreshing directness which not even the
magniloquent verbiage of the 18th century can
altogether strangle. Her narrative, she admits,
has many faults, in palliation of which she asks
her readers to take into account that the youngest
of her fatherless children is an infant of seven
months, “who has, she says, “been chiefly on
my left arm while the right was employed in
bringing to my recollection the pleafing occur-
ences of fifteen months, fpent in the com-
pany of him whofe kind attention supported
me under all my affliction.” The pathetic
simplicity of this picture needs no comment,
and it would be a hard heart that would not
respond to this brave-spirited woman’s hope
“that her situation as nurse, and her being
obliged to attend so much to her domestic con-
cerns, will be accepted as an apology for the
demerits of her book.”
The general quaintness of the little work is
increased by its antiquated typography, the
obsolete “f ’’being responsible for some peculiarly
comic effects. “Garden feed,” for instance, is
more suggestive of green stuff than of the germs
from which it springs, and when we read that
“the fun was high,” we do not immediately
realise that the observation is meteorological and
not psychological.
It was intended that the Gorgon should take
out to “ Sidney ” part of the recently-formed N.S.
Wales corps, under Major Grose, but before the
day of sailing a greater official light arose, in the
person of Captain King, H.N., Lieutenant-
Governor of Norfolk Island, and the eclipsed
Grose was disembarked, to sail later on in the
Pitt, which arrived at Sydney in February, 1792.
The Gorgon reached Teneritfe on 15th April,
and here a tolerable acquaintance with Spanish
made Mrs. Parker the most important member of
the party, and enabled her to act, so to speak, as
commodore of the inevitable mule-back excursions.
Her attendant muleteer, too, she tells us, became
so proud of his charge when he found she could
speak his language that upon entering any town
or village he requested her to sit upright, and then
spread her hair “ very curiously ” over her fhoul-
ders. “ Poor fellow !” she ingenuously adds—
“could I be displeased with his request, since it
arose, without doubt, from a desire of making me
appear to the greateft advantage?”
September 21st found the Gorgon moored in
Port Jackson where were also five newly-arrived
convict-ships, on board of which, says Mrs.
Parker, “a most dreadful mortality had taken
place,” the convicts being reduced to one third of
the number that had left England. Upon this
subject she quotes her husband, who appears to
have been a man of sense and humanity. “ It
makes me shudder,” lie writes, “ when I reflect
that it will not be the last exhibition of this
kind of human misery that will take place
in this country whilst the present method of
transporting these miserable wretches is pur-
sued ; for the more of them that die the
more it redounds to the interest of the ship-
owners and masters, who are paid so much a head
for each individual, whether they arrive in the
colony or not. ’ But, while these poor wretches
lay lotting alive, the anniversary of His Majesty’s
accession arrived, the Gorgon fired the customary
salute, Governor Phillip gave the customary
dinner, and everywhere outside the convict-hospi-
tal it was, “ The King ! God bless him !”
It may he here remarked es curious, in connec-
tion with Australia’s first Governor, Phillip, that,
though we are pretty well acquainted with him as
an official, we know lit tle or nothing of him as a
man. We. have the skeleton, so to speak, of his
personal record, but not the flesh and bl, od.
Mrs. Parker, it is true, has much to say about the
“fatherly attentions of the good Governor,”
under whose hospitable roof, she tells ns, she has
often regaled herself upon “ kingaroo.” She also
provides us with what is probably the first formal
eulogy upon “ Our Beautiful ” :—-
“ The numerous branches, creeks and inlets that are
formed in the harbour of Port Jackson, and the woods
that cover their shores, make the scenery very beautiful •
the north branch particularly so, from the sloping- of its
shores, the interspersion of tufted woods, and the small
islands, which are covered with trees, scattered up and
down. In Sydney Gove there were some ‘‘cool
recesses,” where “ with Captain Parker and the officers,”
quaintly observes the authoress, “I have been many
times revived after the intense heat, taking with us what
was necessary to quench our thirst." Here also she
feasted upon “ Oifters just taken out of the sea, the care
of our sailors in opening and placing them round their
hats in lieu of plates by no means diminishing the satis-
faction we had in eating them.” Over the Sidney
“oisters,” in fact, Mrs. Parker waxes enthusiastic. “ I
have purchased a three-quart bowl of them,” she says,
1 for a pound and a-half of tobacco, besides havin< f - them
opened tor me into the bargain.”
The natives next call for description. “Both
men and women, ’ says Mrs. Parker, with
her customary directness, “go without apparel,”
and she appears to have been somewhat disgusted
to find that the women would as often as not
tye round their toes” the “ribbands” with
which she presented them. “ The salutary custom
of washing,” she gravely adds, “seems entirely
unknown to them.” With one of the men, never-
theless, Mrs. Parker professes herself vastly taken.
“He had a most engaging deportment, and his
manners were far beyond what I could possibly
have expected.” To this dusky Chesterfield Mrs.
Parker presented a knife and fork, with which he
surprised her by demolishing in very fair style
two or three pounds of the ship’s pork. Of Bana-
long, one of the native men, who afterwards visited
Mrs. Parker in England, she says that “ the tear
of sensibility trickled down his cheeks as he gazed
upon a portrait of Captain Pai’ker and spoke with
all the energy of natui’e of the pleasing excursion
which they had made together up the country.”
On 18th DecenAer, after a three months’ stay
in Fort Jackson, the Gox-gon sailed again for
England, and Mrs. Parker concludes the account
of her Australian experiences with a testimony to
the “ lingular fatisfaction ” with which she recalls
the attentions of Governor Phillip, “ who, like the
Monarch of Great Britain., may be justly styled
the Father of his People, to whom the repentant
convict looks up with reverence, and enjoys the
reward of his industry in peace and thankfulness.”
The Mahometans are ousted from Uganda
by the combined Protestants and Catholics. Like
a man and his wife, who combine against the
intruder when he ventures into their quarrel. The
peace has been made, not by squaring up the
faiths, but the spoil. Meanwhile, Mahometanism,
owing to its intense democracy, advances more
rapidly than any other faith.
A Sydney writer licks his memory’s lips
over the good old times “ when the Burragorang
blacks used to march up 400 strong to fight the
Hartley tribes, and when bushrangers were as
numerous as members of Parliament to-day.”
Which collides against facts. Bushrangers in
N.S. Wales were never as numerous as M.’sP. are
to-day ; they never committed as many robberies,
nor raked in as much plunder, all told, as M.’sP.
accomplished in one single year. Bushrangers,
moreover, didn’t gammon that they were robbing
yon for your own good.

Campbell having gone, Duncan Gillies will take
the Postmaster-Generalship, and at the end of
the year Patterson goes to England and retire-
ment, sending Gillies, with one little turn of the
wheel, into the vacant Premiership. The House
will never let Gillies assume the Premiership
openly, but it might tolerate him for a season if
he slides into the position gently. The situation
waits on Gillies, who evidently already begins to
fear that he has overplayed the part of the strong,
still man lying dark on the weather - bow.
Patterson’s recent attitude clearly countenances
a solution like the above.

“ An example should be made of people
who attempt to commit suicide,” said a Melb.
P.M. the other day to a broken-down wreck of a
female who had tried to throw herself into the
Yarra. Then he went on to point out that the
battered creature before the court had rendered
herself liable to two years in gaol, and that next
time she came up as an unsuccessful suicide she
would be “ severely dealt with.” Isn’t it about
time that Sliiels—the only man who is likely to
take up the subject—introduced a Bill to legalise
suicide, provided it is done decently and in order ?
Every person has a right to die when he wants to,
provided he doesn’t leave his corpse in the water-
supply, or spoil anybody’s carpet with his blood-
stains, or hang up or otherwise deposit his remains
where their sudden discovery may frighten some
nervous woman or child into fits, or leave himself
in anybody’s garden without permission, or take
some poison which will cause him to yell for 12
hours and disturb the neighbourhood. Otherwise,
his death is his own funeral, and the P.M.’s
insults, thrown at the head of the suicide who has
failed, are simply impertinent.

“ Love is happiness and the only possession in life
worth having,” arrogantly asserted the youth as
he turned his diamond ring upon his little finger.
there is but one thing in life worth having
and that is money,” said the pauper.
“You forget love,” persisted the youth.
It is a long time since I knew any,” replied
the pauper, “ the goddess likes the society of the
god.”
“Pooh I” said the invalid, as he contemplated
his shrunken limbs, “wealth and love may be
good possessions, but health is happiness ' and
better than either of them.”
“ there is one still greater,” said the clergy-
man, “and that is Faith.”
“ Forgetfulness would mean happiness to me,”
sighed the parricide.
“ Brandy gives it to me,” said the dipsomaniac,
turning his bloodshot eyes lovingly to his half-
emptied glass.
“ I keep it in this vial,” said the morphiomaniao,
as he dissolved the tabloids and filled his syringe.
“Life itself is happiness did we but know it,”
said the condemned criminal, clanking his irons.
“Bah! I expect to find it in death,” said the
would-be suicide, as he pulled the trigger.
“Fame is happiness,” said the cadet, as he
buckled on the sword.
“ Then your chance of enjoying it is infinitesi-
mal,” jeered the wooden-legged pensioner.
“ To love is happiness,” said the young mother,
as she kissed her first-born.
“I don’t find it so,” said the unrequited lover.
“ Let happiness,” said the mathematician, pro-
ducing pencil and paper, “be represented by the
letters X Y Z, and—”
“ That is exactly what it always has been, so
far as I am concerned,” interrupted the misan-
thrope.
“Ah, well,” mumbled the great-great-grand-
mother as she twiddled her bony fingers and
sagely nodded her snow-whitehead, “happiness
is the result of a contented mind.”
“ Or none at all,” sneered the rich relation.
“During our present incarnation,” said the
theosophist, “I doubt if any of us experience
much happiness ; we shall perhaps enjoy more
in——.”
“ Hell,” broke in the larrikin, rudely, as,
squirting some tobacco-juice through his teeth, he
left to join “ the push.”

“ Tales of the Convict System
By PRICE WAR UNCI.
“ ‘ The Transportation System,’ said Archbishop Whately, speaking in the House of Lords in 1840, £ is a monument such
as I suppose was never before erected by any people, Christian or Pagan, of combined wickedness and absurdity.’ How true
this is Marcus Clarke’s great novel has shown and ‘ Price Warung’s ’ stories in this collection show. He has not drawn upon
imagination to a much greater degree than in the alteration of names and dates, so that needless pain should not be given to
worthy persons now living. Written very plainly between the lines of formal documents of the period are narratives of the
blind brutalisrn of almost irresponsible authority, heroic devotion and comradeship stronger than the fear of the torture of
death, noble efforts of truly Christian clergymen to stem influences which deformed body and soul, pathetic records of lives
wrecked by savage laws and men scourged into kinship with devils. ‘ Price Waning ’ has taken this material and, choosing
the most suitable to his purpose, placed it with dramatic force before his readers. The stories, although connected by a thread
of general sequence, are so written that each is complete in itself.”—Sydney Daily Telegraph, 25th June, 1892.
“ The series of powerful stories which have from time to time appeared under this heading in the columns of The
Bulletin, now appear in a neat and excellently-printed volume. Between its covers will be found much that is shameful and
terrible, and far more that is strictly true than is usually to be met with in such publications. The late Marcus Clarke, before
producing ‘ His Natural Life,’ was careful to inform himself fully of the dark details of criminal administration under the old
convict system. The success of that tragic book impelled a host of imitators, possessing little of the writer’s knowledge and
none of his talent, to surfeit morbid sensationalism with gross banquets of resurrected horror. ‘Price Waning,’ as the author
of these tales calls himself, is decidedly not of this class. Two things are unmistakably apparent throughout; his thorough
acquaintance, even to the minutest particulars, with the official records of the time, and the distinct literary ability with which
the subject is treated of. It will be questioned by some whether the shocking circumstances which attended the initial stages
of Australian settlement should be written in modern chronicles. But history should be honest, neither concealing what is bad
nor exaggerating what is good. The evils of the convict system were forced upon the colonies ; rebellion against that
system, its overthrow, and the magnificent progress since made are our own work.

A Universal System of Compulsory Life

ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed -columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the me! hods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
Crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailod from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially written reading matter is the brightest
and ‘best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

** It is full early to remind my readers about the spring clean up, but ‘SUNLIGHT SOAP’
will be always welcome by those who take a pride in their home and surroundings, while to help
one over the trial of washing day, and make clothes as white as snow, ‘SUNLIGHT SOAP 5 is
without exception the best and most economical preparation in the market. Its cleansing power
is wonderful, and yet its purity enables it being used for even the most delicate cambric or lace,
'or for cleaning the most choice paint, while for washing woollen goods this soap justly deserves
the attention of those ladies wishing to keep their flannels soft and equal to now. ‘ SUNLIGHT 1
SOAP,’ cleans anything and everything, is very economical, and greatly lessens household labour,,
therefore what more can be needed of a soap,”
Sunlight Soap is used in Her Majesty the Queen’s Laundry.
