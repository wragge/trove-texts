THE CAMP FIRE.
Frond o’ fern and leaf o’ tree
Steeped in woodland witchery,
Gathered in the dewy sunrise—O the fresh-
ness of the light!
Place them, piled with skilful care ,
Mid the lichened granite, where
In a silver drift of ashes sleeps the fire of
y ester-night.
Still a captive crimson gleam
Hints the passion of its dream:
Wake, wild sleeper! sing your story, thrill
the morning with its theme!
See a slender, glancing shape
Dart and struggle to escape,
Whispering low impatient longings for de-
light it cannot tell,
And the rhythmic rings of smoke
From the brushwood’s breaking yoke
Curl in soft, ascending spirals like a song
made visible!
Leaf o' tree and frond o' fern —
Toss more handfuls; in return
Wealth of warmth and heady odors shall be
given back tenfold;
Fluttering, laughing, ever higher
Climbs the swift exultant fire,
As the crimson leaps to scarlet and the
scarlet leaps to gold,
While the joyous stream of heat
Rises resolute and fleet
Whither, tangled in the turquoise, lofty
branches curve and meet.
Splendid prisoner set free!
Gazing upward dreamily,
Watch it mount in crystal air-waves, bright,
liquescent, tremulous,
Watch it pierce and vanish through!
What lies out beyond the Blue?
Further, fairer worlds than this one? This
is fair enough for us.
Frond *o' fern and leaf o’ tree —
Armfuls now, when stealthily
Dusk of evening draws and deepens round
* about the waning flame;
Through the darkness faces peer,
Moan and gibber—forms of fear,
Angry ghosts from the Alch6ringa before the
White Man came,
And the very tent roofs show
In the livid afterglow
Strange and menacing, like peaks of old vgl-
canoes pale with snow. '
Stir and tease a fiercer blaze,
Search the night with gilding rays!*
Safe within the magic circle of the firelight,
what care we?
Listen! with a rush of stars
Gates of Heaven loose their bars
And the silence floods the forest with un-
earthly harmony!
Leaf o' tree and frond o’ fern,
These shall weave us as they burn
Such a garland, O my brothers, as the long
4/ears cannot dim,
W'hile the quiet of the sky
Kindles every glowing eye,
And the nectar of the hill-wind quickens
every tireless limb,
Such a fragrant wreath to keep
In remembrance hidden deep
'Gainst the grey and dusty sadnesses that
through the future creep.
Should the days bring grief alone
We shall flinch not who have knoivn
Early morning on the mountains’with its
rose-hues fugative,
Springing water’s lucent flight,
Cool sweet mystery of night,
Young enjoyment of good fellowship—the
best life has to give!
Frond o' fern and leaf o’ tree,
Feed the Fire of Memory!
Elsie Cole, in “Holiday Songs.”
J*
Light verse, but true verse, is to be found
in Holiday Songs, by Elsie Cole (George
Robertson). Many of these delightful verses
have been reprinted from The Bulletin,
The Lone Hand and other Australian pub-
lications. Elsie • Cole has a real feeling for
nature; and though her melody is played on
but a limited gamut of notes, the notes are
carefully in tune, and the simple tune
awakens pleasant memories. Technically no
fault can be found with her song; but it is a
feminine slight thing, concerned but with
simple issues. “The White Gum Tree”
begins charmingly thus :
She stands deep hid from the wind's caress,
And the shades of the foot-hills frame
A wonder of bright white nakedness,
.A beauty outshining shame.
On the brink of the river, erect and slender,
She startles the green with a sudden
splendor,
A fountain of silver flame.
“Rondeau.” “Midsummer Eve,” “The Old-
est Art.” the sonnet “Foam Flowers” and
“The Playmate” each admirably express a
mood; and in the next forthcoming Aus-
tralian anthology one or more of these should
find place. But, so far, the depths and the
heights of poetry are not within her com-
pass. A wayside blossom on the by-path of
minor poetry, but worth the cherishing.
*
At last there looms in sight the produc-
tion by professionals of the Australian
drama. In the scheme adopted by the citi-
zens’ committee for the celebration in
N.S.W. of the terceptenary of Shakespeare,
there is a clause providing that one-fifth of
the money collected, but not exceeding
£3OOO, is to be devoted to the encouragement,
©f Australian literaure and dramatic art,
either by means of an annual prize or in
such other way as may hereafter be deter-
mined. And Mr. J. C. Williamson has stated
that he will be willing to produce any Aus-
tralian play thus honored by the Shake-
speare committee. It should be “up to”
every dramatic aspirant to subscribe to the
memorial.
The European Drama
Slowly the drama of contemporary Europe
is filtering though into English thought.
Tchekoff, Wedekind and. Strindberg are ap-
pearing in admirable translations, to react
later upon the formalism and Wowserism of
the modern English drama. Ibsen has
already permeated English literature: the
later influences will effect an equally funda-
mental revolution. Only in Ireland has
there arisen a dramatic ideal worthy to rank
with that of the European school. It is to
these two foreign influences that we must
look for the renaissance of the English
drama.
J*
Plays by Anton Tchekoff (Duckworth, per
Sydney Book Club) include four dramas,
three of which are translated for the first
time. The Sea-Gull has already been re-
viewed on this page. Uncle Vanya, Ivanoff,
and the one-act sketch, The Swan Song,
theatrically effective,, but of no dramatic
value, introduce us' once again to the
Russian world of utterly futile people, living
on decaying estates in the desolate country,
dissatisfied with themselves, bored by their
tedious life, but temperamentally unable to
find a way out except by the anti-climax of
suicide -
During the last grey years of the nine-
teenth century the lonely country and stag-
nant provincial towns of Russia buried a
peasantry which was enslaved by want and
toil, and an educated upper class which
was enslaved by idleness and tedium. Most
of the “Intellectuals,” with no outlet for
their energies, were content to forget their
ennui in vodka and card-playing; only the
more idealistic gasped for air in the stifling
atmosphere, crying out in despair against
life as they saw it, and looking forward with
a pathetic hope to happiness for humanity
in “two or three hundred years.”
Ivanlioff was written at white-heat in two
and a half weeks. The characters in this
four-act drama are nearly all of equal im-
portance. The name-part is a true Tchekoff
type —a most ordinary, weak man, one of
those useless people for whose futility this
most famous of the dramatists of Russia felt
such overwhelming pity. There are no
heroics in Tchekoff; the characters speak
their own prolix, redundant speeches, not
the crisp, weighty words of the ordinary
drama. And there is seldom a “curtain,”
except in the last act where there is the in-
evitable revolver 'shot. Here is the ending
of the first act in Uncle Vanya :—
Telegin strikes the strings of his guitar
and plays a polka. Madame Voitskaya
writes something on the leaves of her
pamphlet. The curtain falls.
But the pathos of the third act must on
the stage prove almost too pitiable, expressed
as it is in the most commonplace words —
the words that grief would in real life in-
stinctively use. The drama ends in a key of
noble sadness. The girl, Sonia, who lets a
man see her love for him, and is rejected,
sits down at the table to bury her grief in
work.
What can we do? We must live our lives.
Yes, we shall livg. We shall live through
the long procession of days before us, and
through the. long evenings ; we shall patiently
bear the trials that fate imposes on us, we
shall work for others without rest, both now
and when we are old; and when our last
hour comes we shall meet it humbly, and
there, beyond the grave, we shall say that
we have suffered and wept, that our life was
bitter, and God will have pity on u 5.... We
shall rest. ...We shall see all evil and all our
pain sink away in the great compassion that
shall enfold the world. I have faith; I
have faith. (She wipes away her tears.)
My poor, poor Uncle Vanya, you are crying!
You have never known what happiness was,
but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait! We shall
rest. (She embraces him.) We shall rest.
(The watchman's rattle is heard in the
garden; Telegin plays softly; Madame
Voitskaya writes something on the margin
of her pamphlet; Marina knits her stock-
ing.) We shall rest.
J*
Compared with that strange tragedy of child-
hood, The Awakening of Spring, Frank
Wedekind’s Such is Life (Brown Brothers,
Philadelphia) is meekly innocuous. This
play, in five acts, is a satire upon fiingship.
Though the scene is set in medieval Perugia,
the dramatist strikes at modern Germany,
and the Kaiser’s pretensions tp Divine right.
The plot shows a butcher, the leader of a
revolt, deposing the king pf Perugia and
succeeding to his throne. The butcher
makes a better king than his predecessor,
but the deposed king learns in his misfor-
tunes to become a better man. Ultimately
he is appointed court fool to the reigning
monarch, but on his death betra„ * his iden-
tity. A satire on an institution that is
hardly worth satire.
J*
Two more of Strindberg’s many plays are
also available in translation, There Are
Crimes and Crimes (Scribner, New York)
and Countess Julia (Brown Bros., Phila-
delphia). The first play, in four acts, was
written by Strindberg at the age of 50, in
the year that marked his recovery from his
four years of mental crisis, when it was
thought that he would never again attain
complete sanity. As a play it is crudely
constructed; but it is the most frequently
played and most enthusiastically received of
Strindberg’s later dramas.
Maurice is a playwright, whose first play
is about to be produced in Paris. He has a
mistress and a child, but is led away from
these by Henriette, the mistress of a friend
of his. See what Strindberg makes of the
entrance of Henriette —how at once he pre-
pares us for the tragedy of her personality:
Henriette enters. Maurice turns round,
raises his hat, and stares at Henriette, who
looks him over carefully. Immediately after-
wards she goes quietly out, and Maurice
stares after her. Madame Catherine, the
keeper of the cremerie where they have met,
asks him banteringly how he thinks she
looks. Maurice stammers :
Let me see: I can’t tell —I didn’t see her,
for it was as if she had rushed straight into
my arms at once and come so close to me
that I couldn’t make out *her features at
all. And she left her impression on the air
behind her. I can still see her standing
there. (7/e goes toward the door, and
makes a gesture as if putting his arm
around somebody.) Whew! {He makes a
gesture as if he had pricked his finger.)
There are pins in her waist. She is of the
kind that stings!... .Oh, that woman is
horrible!.... She seemed to suck herself out
through the door, and in her wake rose a
little whirlwind that dragged me along—-
yes, you may laugh, but can’t you see that
the palm over there on the buffet is still
shaking? She’s the very devil of a woman!
Do you believe in fate, Madame Catherine?
“No,” Madame answers, “I believe in a
good God, who protects us against evil pow-
ers if we ask Him in the right way.” “So,”
exclaims Maurice, “there are evil powers,
after all! I think I can hear them in the
hallway now.”
There, by the simplest means, the drama-
tist has conveyed to the audience an in-
tangible thing, the attraction of this woman.
Maurice’s play is a success, and instead
of returning to his mistress and his child, of
even to his friends, he spends the evening
with Henriette at a cafe. The next day the
child dies, and, from some expressions used
by Henriette and Maurice overheard by the
waiter, suspicion swiftly fixes itself on
Maurice as the murderer. Instantly
Maurice’s success is turned to failure; he is
arrested ; his play is withdrawn. The next
day he is released from gaol; but his whole
nature has been changed. “They put in one
person and let out another through that gate
which separates us from the rest of society.”
The police spy on the pair, the cafes refuse
to admit two such notorious persons. They
have now come to hate each other, yet they
cannot separate. But in the final scene we
see the reconciliation between Henriette and
her former lover, and the rehabilitation of
Maurice. The kindly Abbe gives Maurice
the choice of going to the theatre, where a
demonstration is to be held in his honor, as
his play has been put on again, or to the
church, to pray for the soul of his dead child.
And Maurice decides to go with the Abbe.
But the Abb6 releases him. “That you have
got through with this so quickly as you have
is to me a sign that you have suffered your
punishment as intensely as if it had lasted
an eternity. And when Providence absolves
you, there is nothing for me-to add.”
“But why,” asks Maurice, “did the pun-
ishment have to be so hard when I was inno-
cent?” The Abbe replies: “Hard? Orly
two days! And you were not innocent. For
we have to stand responsible for our
thoughts and words and desires also. And-
in your thought you became a murderer
when your evil self wished the life out of
your child.”
That is the crime that is unpun-
ished by law; but the evil-doer cannot
escape the punishment of his own conscience.
Henriette asks: “Are you sure the evil will
cannot ki11?....1n my own family I am
sure that my mother and my sisters killed
my father with their hatred. (This is the
thought underlying Strindberg’s grim play.
The Father.) You see, he had the awful
idea that he must oppose all our tastes and
inclinations. Wherever he discovered a
natural gift, he tried to root it out. In that
way he aroused a resistance that accumu-
lated until it became like an electrical bat-
tery charged with hatred. At last it grew
so powerful that he languished away, be-
came depolarised, lost his will-power, and, in
the end, came to wish himself dead.”
There are Crimes and Crimes is a realistic
play, though crudely constructed, packed
with dramatic scenes and full of action. But
underneath lies this mystical idea. The
strength of the play resides in the dramatic
mastery which has so perfectly united Him*
two themes.
d*
Horrible naturalism is Strindberg’s Coun-
tess Julia, a one-act play for only three
characters —and in his one-act plays, it has
been well said, Strindberg gave to the drama
a new art, as Maupassant gave the short
story to literature. Countess Julia is a
kitchen tragedy. Christina, the cook, is in
love with Jean, the valet; and Countess
Julia, after dancing with the servants 0 £
the estate on St. John’s Eve, comes to the
kitchen. She has just broken off her en-
gagement, and is in a restless and desperate
mood, ready for any distraction. Already
she has shown her liking for the valet, and
the sly, impudent Jean is ready tp encourage
her advances. Then the inevitable, we are
told, happens, and the woman cries: “What
shall we do?” The valet has his ready
answer. “Fly, travel to Switzerland, to the
Italian lakes.”
Julia : Is it beautiful there?
Jean : Eternal summer, oranges, laurels
ah.
Julia : Yes, but' what shall we do there
afterward?
Jean : Open a first-class hotel for first-
class patrons.
Julia: An hotel?
Jean : That’s a real life, you may believe
me. Always new points of view, new
languages.. ..
And the fellow grows rapturous over his
pet scheme. But the woman is only con-
cerned with his feelings for her. She must
hear him say that he loves her—or else,
what is she else? But he makes her sit
down and talk things over, sensibly. He
needs funds for his hotel: she must provide
them. They quarrel, and the despair of the
girl, who has given herself* to a worthless
scoundrel, reaches, by Strindberg’s deep
psychological intuition, agonising depths.
“You do not want to die with me?” she
asks at last. And Jean flippantly replies
that he does not want to die at all, so Julia
steals the money for their journey, and re
turns ready to start, carrying her pet gold-
finch in its cage! Jean is amazed. When
they dare not take any luggage, or their
flight will be discovered, why on earth should
this woman want to travel with a bird-
cage? There is only one thing to do, to kill
the bird. Jean calmly takes the bird from
her and carries it over to the kitchen block;
then, with the remark, “You should have
been taught to kill chickens instead of to
shoot with revolvers, then you would not
faint at a drop of blood,” he calmly chops
off its head. And in the midst of their
anxiety, Julia’s father, the count, returns,
and is heard through the speaking tube ask-
ing for his boots and his coffee. The girl
sees nothing now to save her honor but sui-
cide. But she lacks the strength of will to
kill herself; and in a scene terrible in its
horror she compels Jean to hypnotise her to
cut her throat.
Julia : Have you never been to the
theatre and seen the hypnotist? He says
to the medium: “Take a broom”; it takes
it; he says : “Sweep” ; and it sweeps.
Jean : But then the other has to be
asleep.
Julia ( exalted ) : I am already asleep—
the entire room is as full of smoke before my
e^es —and you look like an iron stove —
which resembles a man dressed in black
with an opera hat —and your eyes gleam like
coals, when the fire goes down—and your
face is a white speck like ashes
And Jean takes up the razor with which
he has been shaving himself, and puts it in
her hand. “There is the broom ! Go now
into the barn and” He whispers the rest
into her ear.
The construction of this drama, the whole
burden of which must be borne by the three
characters, is masterly. The tragedy, on
the stage, must come to the audience with
shattering force. James Huneker says:
“The finale makes Ghosts an entertainment
for urchins,” But the thing, despite the emo-
tional tides it stirs, is written with a sin-
cerity that has in it no trace of the porno-
graphic.

The Herald (Melbourne) won’t have the threat-
ened opposition yet awhile, lhe Sun, in Sydney,
had arranged for a cable service, which is costing
£15,000 a year, and a way had to be found of get-
ting someone to share that expense. The idea of a
Melbourne edition thus naturally suggested itself.
Then the Herald saw what was wanted, and agreed
to “go whacks’’ with the service. So the Melbourne
edition was gladlv dropped.

“Montales”: When I came to know Windsor 1 was
on the Leader, and some articles I had pseudo-signed
“The Coppersmith” attracted the great man’s atten-
tion —chiefly, I think, because they ran counter to
some of his most cherished convictions. At all events
he walked one day into my editor’s office to inquire
about my identity, and, as I happened to be there at
the time, Syme (not David) turned him on to me at
once. Windsor asked my name, expressed surprise at
my youthfulness, shook hands, and plunged at once
into an attack upon my latest screed. He was bril-
liant. but unconvincing, and very soon, seeing that he
wasn't driving home his nails, he pulled up short.
“Now, then,” he said, “ you show cause!” I “showed”
accordingly, and, when I shut off, Windsor gazed at
me for a moment in apparent surprise. Then, with a
twinkle in his eye, he quoted, “Alexander the copper-
smith withstood us greatly,” thus neatly punning
upon both pen-name and real name. He took to me
after that, and I, who knew him perhaps as well as
any man, can safely assert that, however well he
fought the battle of Democracy, he was not a Demo-
crat at heart. On the contrary, he was distinctly
aristocratic in his intense repugnance to everything
crude, unrefined or non-intellectual. But he saw no-
thing derogatory in thinking one way and writing
the other. Which was doubtless why he used to
snort at the idea of signed journalism. “A journal-
ist,” he used to say, “is merely a professional phrase-
finder. A newspaner proprietor wants certain ideas
promulgated, and lie buys, therefore, the services of
an expert in expression. The whole thing is simply
a commercial transaction, and what the scribbler
personally thinks or believes shouldn’t come into the
question at aIL The ‘venal pen’ is a figment of the
imagination.”

“Ross Crae”: There is joy in the ranks of Tas-
manian Toryism, for Nettlefold has resigned the
management of the Dailt Post, the standard-bearer
of democracy in the Island Speck. He has crowded
more into his last few years than probably any other
apple islander. The establishment of the Post was
his first effort. Then came the purchase of the
Cupper : then followed the acquisition of the Tas-
manian News. About this time Slowbart was rent
with rumor that Nettlefold had secured an
option over the awful Mercury ; but unluckily it
was only rumor. The next move was to send out
a small army of canvassers to the Launceston end of
the island, to get support for a proposed northern
edition of the Post ; but at thig juncture Nettlefold’s
medical adviser put the brakes hard on. Tasmania,
and Australia for the matter of that, owe something
to the strenuous person. When in 1908 he burned
his bridges behind him in order to bring out the
Post, the Federal sentiment was so low in the island
that few would do it reverence. To-day that senti-
ment is so healthy that at the Referenda Tassy gave
a greater proportion of Yes votes than any
State in the Union except W.A. Also, he found demo-
cratic sentiment so attenuated that Labor held less
than one-fifth of the Assembly seats. Now the Labor
party is but two short of the other crowd. No won-
der, now that Nettlefold has to take a pull, Tory
newspapcrdom is throwing up its nightcap!
* * * *
“Penman”: As a reporter, I pause after reckoning
up seventy and seven I have known. Pastor Leyton
Richards, of Melbourne, declares that no religious
function ought to be reported except by a pious man.
Two rise in my recoUection. But it was only after
the inspiration of many beers that they mounted up
to the Richards ideal, with “Sh! sh!” if anvone
began profane talk in the office. And, honestly, what
encouragement does the pious reporter get? A Sal
vatioriist said to me, “Why don’t you work for a re
ligious paper?” Says I, “Because they are all
sweaters! They all want to get their stuff for no
thing. I have to live by my pen. If the religions
paper offers you any money at all, it is so little
that the amount suggests to me ‘The Song 0 f the
Shirt!’” Yet I don’t altogether blame religious
newspaper proprietors and editors. Their sancti
mcmious public is so mean and mangey. It wants its
papers for nothing. Again and again I’ve noticed
that the first paper wolfed by the Wowsers in the
Melbourne Atherueum is The Bulletin. The second
(this, no doubt, in expiation) is the Holt Crux.
* * * *
F.. T. Maley has been appointed editor of Barrier
Truth —the 14th or so in the Labor paper’s brief
lifetime. This Maley is brother of Charles the
paper’s parent or thereabouts. He is in for trouble
pretty soon, for in the teeth of the violent Red Tie
party at Broken Hill, he started a column of “Mili-
tary Notes.” There was an instant row, of course
but Maley pointed to the Labor platform and the
Miners' Association vote, and in so many words in-
vited the rebels to go outside and howl on the mat.
* * * *
“NightowT: I wish someone would convince the
young reporters and a few of the snuffy old ones that
big words and roundabout ways of arranging them
make bad journalism. “Made the recipient of” in-
stead of “was given,” “donated’’ instead of “gave ”
“mournful cortege”—what tons of such words there
are 1 I worked for an editor once who always put
the sub-head, “A Pleasing Function,” over reports of
send-offs, concerts, balls, prize-givings and things of
that sort. And to what a lot of trouble some of
these fellows go to write a thing as they wouldn’t
dream of saying it! When I was called to task by
the editor of a country paper for writing in plain
Australian on a weighty subject, I remarked, in de-
fence, that The Bulletin puts things that way (mv
way was similar, but better). “That’s a very good
reason why it shouldn’t be put that way in my
paper,” said he, and seemed to bulge when he said
it. Talking of country pressmen, it’s about time
they got a Wages Board and a minimum rate not
below that given to (say) carpenters, along with some
limitation of hours. I figured out a fortnight’s work-
ing time when I was editor of a good-sized pro-
vincial daily, and it came a penny or two below a
bob an hour. The same papier, some time before
used to employ an unsuccessful member of one of “the
learned professions” to damn the Fisher Government
He got ss. per leader (average, about 800 words)

“Locust”: A. Bigelow Paine’s biography explains
a Sydney mystery in regard to Mark twain. A
Sydney pressman, at the Hotel Australia, in 1896,
during the lecturing tour of the great humorist)
asked Mark something about Bret Harte; whereupon
Mark wait off into one of those lurid rages which
are abundantly described in the present biography.
The air of Castlereagh-street assumed a bright pastei
blue color, and the Hotel Australia rocked on its
foundations. Then Mark subsided, like the waters of
the Flood, leaving the reporter, wet and bedraggled,
on a kind of sulphur-coated Mount Ararat. The
mystery is now explained. Mark and Bret, after
having been friends, shop-mates and comrades for
years, met in New York, and agreed to collaborate on
a play of Chinese character, “Ah Sin,” to be written
for Parsloe, a well-known Chink impersonator. The play
was very funny, as it naturally would be, but it
wouldn’t “act,” and was a dismal failure. The col-
laborators quarrelled as to the apportionment of
the blame, and never spoke again.

“Pedro J. Vallaze”: Coincident with his short
Parliamentary career as member for Tamworth, the
late Hanley Bennett ran a journalistic curio called
The Free Selector, better known to outsiders as
The Tamworth Sometimes. He scornfullv ignored
the editorial “we.” and studded his leaders" with the
biggest cap). “I's” to be found amongst his half-
dozen cases of battered pica. He” and Henrv
Labouchere, of London Truth, were the only states-
men journalists, he used to claim, with sufficient
force and literary charm to safelv accomplish this
feat


A GREAT RECORD
Following the recent successes of the B.S.A. Motor-Cycles in the Austral-
asian 24 hours’ road record and one hour track record comes the pulverisa-
tion of the Sydney to Melbourne Record by Mr. Jack Gunn, riding a Standard
2$ h.p.
B.S.A. Motor Cycle
when all previous records were beaten by over 3% hours! The secret of it in
the rider’s own words: —
“ I Never Opened My Tool Bag.”
In the Speedwell Cup contest (3 events), B.S.A. machines were
placed first and third against all other makes.
In the L/.M.C. Trophy contest (3 events), B.S.A. riders gained equal
first against all other makes.
In the Southland Tfials (N.Z.), the B.S.A. won first and champion-
ship, and put up a Record of 216 miles to the gallon.
If you want Speed, Reliability, Economy, Beauty of Design, and the most

Taibragar, Dubbo, Jan. 6, 1913.
Dear Sirs.—lt is now about four months since your Air Gas Machine was installed in my
residence. Its efficiency has exceeded all expectations; for light, economy, cleanliness, as well as
for cooking purposes, it is the best that I know of. My 20-Light Machine provides sufficient
light for all purposes, in addition to supplying gas for the stove. To be able to do all cook-
ing by gas in a country home at a moderate cost is a convenience that must appeal to anvone
making a gas installation, especially when domestic help is at such a premium. Wishing "you
all the success that your machine merits. —I am, yours faithfully, (Sgd.) F. C. WAKE.

“Salt-Cellars” and No Bust
do great harm to a woman’s appearance. You can increase
your vitality, build up your strength, develop your bust'’to
normal, and fill out the unsightly “salt-cellars.”
A thin woman is not necessarily plain; in fact, many thin
women are admittedly pretty, but the admission is always
qualified with—“but, poor thing, she is so terribly thin.”
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect flesh builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week.

The Pariah.
He burned his youth, a steady flame,
Absorbing musty books,
11 is years all consecrate to Fame
Were younger than his looks.
In discontent he yawned at last,
And shut and locked the door
Upon the dull, familiar past,
And sought the world once more.
About him on his lonely way
He wore a thin disguise
Hf raillery. The brave display
Deceived no watching eyes.
He walked the streets, a man apart;
For him no woman smiled,
Chill fingers clutched his bloodless heart
VV hen all that saw reviled.
He heard soft laughter ring above
Coarse jesting that misseems,
As happy women, sweet with love,
Passed by him, fair as dreams.
Young girls, desirable and sweet,
With swishing petticoats,
Chid ardent lovers in the street,
Soft music in their throats.
Ecstatic creatures, light as air,
With sensuous, soft demand.
Recoiling from his ghastly stare,
Whirled in a saraband.
E’en those whose lips for ready hire
The lips of love abused
With cheap and ever-burning fire,
Instinctively refused.
He gained a street where love and light
Rolled up and disappeared.
And raucous men blasphemed the night,
And tattered women jeered.
Within a chill-dark lane he found
A waif as lone as he;
Beside him on the naked ground
She sheltered bitterly.

The Sea-Garden.
Earth has full many a garden;
But dearer to me
Is the garden that grows in the silence
And shade of the sea.
Its blossoms are strange and unscented,
Of purple and red;
And moonlight and sunlight are even
With the white dead. *
The green-haired sea-maidens lean o’er
them,
Who care for no maiden,
Their pale limbs too cold for caresses,
With long weed laden.
They know neither joying nor sorrow,
Nor pleasure nor passion;
Yet they smile through the pale-green
water
In a strange fashion.
Tboy heed not the years in their passing ;
They strive not, nor weep.
TV>“v have found in their silent sea-garden
The flower of sleep.

The Woman In White.
In white I saw you come to me,
The flush upon your cheek; your eye
Bright in that hour of ecstasy
Which cradled then our last good-bye.
In white I saw you once again—
That long night after we were wed,
When you were false and Life was vain,
And Hope, and Time and God were dead.
In white, once more, I saw you, girl,
At dawn upon a rain-drenched day ;
I kissed one half-forgotten curl,
And blessed the coffin where you lay.

Carton’s Idyll,
Carton is broken, his name a jest,
His pocket empty, his spirit sore;
He had his day, and his day was blest
With friends in plenty and gold in store:
But somewhere under our smiling skies
He loved (being youthful and all unwise)
A little red mouth and two violet eyes.
The girl, in truth, was a dainty girl
With all the wiles of her angel-kind,
With mouth of coral and teeth of pearl
And hands well schooled to tangle and
bind.
’Tis said by some and some men swear
That the silken mesh of a woman’s hair
Was ever and ever a fateful snare.
While the money lasted the dance went on.
“True love,” sighed Carton, “true love is
this!” .
Her eyes, replying, with passion shone;
Her red mouth lifted he stooped to kiss:
Somewhere, somewhere, some poet sings—
In telling his tales of queens and kings—
That gold buys love, like other things.
The money ended, the dance fell through ,
The lights went out and the gloom began :
\nd the old. old tale that is ever new
Was told once more of another man ;
Her brow was white, but her mouth was red,
And, filling her looks with ice, she ; said:
“A long farewell —our love is dead.’
Carton is broken and bowed by care.
His skies dark clouded —no longer blue:
He thought that love was a lasting wear,
But lo —it was rags in a year or two.
Now love —bought love—is at times a traud,
Like silk, and satin, and gem, and gaud,
And other wares that the sellers laud.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice,
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read, and, where . prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the form
of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse, Short
Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Australian sub-
jects, and not exceeding two columns in length, or,
say, SOOO words, are specially acceptable), Paragraphs,
Letters or Newspaper Clippings. All communications
will be regarded as strictly confidential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when
the address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But
no MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these
conditions are observed. When MS. is forwarded with-
out stamps for return it .will be understood that the
copy is to be destroyed if not acceptable. Personal
applications for return of MS. cannot receive atten-
tion. The Bulletin desires, further, those sending
MS. to distinctly understand that it is not respon-
sible for the preservation or transmission of MS.
To Amateurs in Black and White,
Anyone supplying to The Bulletin original
humorous or other topical drawings in line or wash, of
sufficient merit and interest and adapted for direct
reproduction, or any interesting photograph illus-
trative of a current event, will be paid for same on
acceptance. Any picture containing a good idea, but
unfitted for direct reproduction — i.e., any picture
which has to be re-drawn —will be paid for as a
suggestion only. The conditions under which such
artistic contributions will be received are those
applying to MS.

FAIR RENT AND ALARMED FAT.
A Fair Rent Bill is among the latest pro-
positions of the McGowen Government of
New South Wales. It is supposed to apply
to the State at large, but it is really aimed
at the landlords of Sydney, that being the
part of the State where rents are most ex-
traordinary, In the Cornstalk metropolis, at
the present time, rents have gone up out of
sight, for the simple reason that the compe-
tition for houses is far beyond the average.
The position of Sydney to-day is an
interesting study. The population of
New South Wales is increasing rapidly by
reason of good seasons and good prices for
wheat, wool and metals. It is increasing
something extra for the time being by rea-
son of the fact that the McGowen Govern-
ment is borrowing money on twice as lavish
a scale as the worst and maddest and most
depraved of its predecessors. And owing to
the One Big City Congestion Policy of the
McGowen Ministry—the policy which keeps
every good harbor save Sydney closed
foreign commerce —the legitimate
increase of population which comes of good
seasons and good prices, and the illegiti-
mate increase which comes of huge loans and
crazy expenditure, are mainly concentrated in
and immediately around the capital. That one
centre is gathering in more people than all
the rest of the State, and seeing that New
South Wales covers more than 310,000
square miles, this is no small proposition.
It represents an effort in the way of Con-
gestion such as the world has never, or
hardly ever, seen before, and such an effort
as the world, if it has a fair measure of
common sense, will never see again.
* * * *
Quite naturally, the extension of Sydney
hasn’t kept pace with the rush of new in-
habitants. It is obvious to everybody who
knows anything of the past that the good
seasons won’t last, and that the high prices
of produce can’t be wholly relied upon.
Also, it is plain that the mines can’t hold
out for ever. As for the loan boom, it
isn’t likely to endure for more than another
year or so. If it lasted at the present
pace for another 10 years, New South
Wales would owe £200,000,000. If it
lasted at the present pace for another
hundred years New South Wales would owe
about £1,000,000,000 (one thousand millions),
which is an absolutely impossible amount.
The landlord lets his houses nowadays on a
sort of auction principle, and the person
who offers the most exorbitant rent gets the
premises. So the landlord, for the moment,
is on a good wicket, and realises a very fine
return on his capital. But even the fine
return doesn’t induce him to supply new
houses on a scale commensurate with the
demand. He recognises, as well as any-
body else, the fleeting character of the
present burst of prosperity. And when a
great loan sham bursts no one strikes
trouble more quickly than the man
who builds and lets small houses.
The community becomes poor, and three
families crowd into one house, leaving
the other two houses' vacant. There are
long intervals of emptiness, and in between
these intervals the premises are let to ten-
ants who often prove non-financial and finish
up by “shooting the moon.” Unlet cottages
are occupied at night by insolvent outdoor
characters who climb in through the win-
dows, and foul the nremises, and tear
down the woodwork . for fuel. Owing
to the violent fluctuations that are born
of the loan and boom and congestion
policy, the owner of small suburban resi-
dences was often a glad man in 1894 if
he got as a steady average 2 per cent, on the
cost of his premises, while in 1913 he isn’t a
wildly surprised man if he gets 14 per cent.
But he is fully aware that the 14 per
cent., being built on a burst of good luck and
loan madness, can’t last, and that the bald,
bleak, 2 per Cent, days may soon come back.
Hence arises the house famine and other
troubles. When one big city contains nearly
half the population of an immense State, its
position must, of necessity, be precarious.
It isn’t so much a city as a spasm.
The Fair Rent Bill is an idea which, un-
der normal circumstances, would be highly
commendable. Its purpose is to prevent the
landlord exacting outrageous prices for the
use of his property when times are good.
Unfortunately, it can’t be accompanied by a
Fair Tenant Bill to ensure him even a
steady 3 or 4 per cent, return when times
are bad. At present the house-owner has so
little faith in the durability of the good times
that even his grasping nature —and he is
distinctly a person with a grasping nature —
won’t induce him to rush up enough tene-
ments t 6 accommodate the population of
Sydney. Difficulties about bricks and labor
may be part'of the trouble, but lack of confi-
dence is probably the biggest element. And
if the multitudinous and greedy private land-
lord won’t build enough houses to meet
the demand when he is able to charge
perhaps 12 per cent, on his outlay, he is
hardly likely to build more houses when his
return is cut down to 7 or 8 per cent.
Under a Fair Rent Bill he will probably
leave off building, and then, in the brief
space of time between the new legislation
and the downfall, affairs will be worse than
they were before.
* * * *
The present Aew South Wales Ministers
came into office pledged as honorable men —
the same as Brutus, who was mentioned in
Mark Antony’s oration on the remnants of
CiESAR —to reduce borrowing. Instead, they
have, in utter shamelessness, increased the
State’s annual borrow three, or perhaps four-
fold. They professed to take up the ques-
tion of decentralisation, but Eden remains
the same lone, deserted port as of old, and
the North Coast railway has been dragged
round in a great semi-circle lest it should
touch the splendid harbor of Port Stephens,
and give the northern part of the State a
convenient outlet, much nearer than Sydney,
for its oversea traffic. The McGowen Min-
istry is pledged to State ownership of land,
and the State ownership of cities is much
more important, from a financial standpoint,
than the State ownership of hungry areas in
the Far West, where there is neither railway
nor river communication. Yet it had the
opportunity, by building a very few miles of
railway and incurring a very small expense
otherwise, to establish at Port Stephens and
Twofold Bay cities of which the State
would be perpetual ground landlord, and
thereby live up to its alleged principles, and
relieve the pressure on Sydney, and at the
same time make a large profit for the com-
munity, and it deliberately threw the chance
aside. It has devoted itself to loan-monger-
ing, and to dragging everything and every-
body to the one overgrown centre, on a scale
never before attempted. Naturally Sydney,
as the result of these doings, is just now a
place of ephemeral boom, and a costly city
to live in. Everybody who is possessed of
intelligence knows that the present pros-
perity is the matter of a day, for the loan
frenzy can’t last, and the policy which con-
gests the great bulk of the new population
of a great State on to one small speck of
ground, is so unwholesome that it must be
temporary. So Sydney has become like a
new gold rush —a transient sort of institu-
tion where even a very big return won’t
tempt the far-seeing jerry-builder to
risk too much of his money in the house-
providing industry. And how Jerry, the
builder, will be induced to risk more money
by cutting down his profits, the Lord only
knows.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sydney and Its Railway.
The Sydney city railway still plods (on
paper) along its uncertain course. The re-
port of the wonderful expert who was im-
ported at great expense to give a hurried
opinion about a place which he had neyei
seen before, and about conditions of which
he w T as wholly ignorant till he arrived, has
already gone into the waste paper basket.
It was a practically useless document,
thrown together in haste and repented of at
leisure. The great difficulty, as this paper
has so often pointed out before, is that no
one seems to have courage enough to tear
down the wonderful Hump and Dead Him
railway station that hangs out near Ked-
fern, and obliterate the Dead End, and
shovel away the artificial and costly Hump
on which the building stands, and start
afresh. And unless that is done there is no
satisfaction to be got anywhere. The pre-
sent station is fitted for nothing save a
tjerminus. A huge mound was built at vast
expense so that the train might come in
uphill in case it happened to have got out
of hand and developed a tendency to bolt.
That is a good and sensible arrangement
for a terminus, but if the line is carried on
into the city, and the Dead End is. abol-
ished, then the Hump becomes an insane
nuisance. Now, there are two propositions
in view. One is an immense and high-
priced viaduct, in order that the trains
which have climbed up the Hump as they
come in from the country or the suburbs
may climb down again and go on their way
rejoicing into Sydney proper. By that
means the Hump would be. preserved as an
obstruction which had outlived any useful-
ness it ever possessed. The other idea is
to tunnel at great price under the present
premises, so that the new city railway would
leave the main line about Eveleigh. That
would produce some curious results. Cer-
tain trains would presumably still climb up
the old Hump and stop at the old premises,
for unless they did so there would be no
sense in preserving the old premises, and
maintaining a staff there, and keeping the
place supplied with paint and repairs. Those
passengers who wanted to go further into
the city—which means, probably, nine-
tenths of the passengers —would, then get
out with curses, and gather their luggage
with objurgations, and depart with blas-
phemy and impedimenta down a lift to a
subterranean den in. the bowels of the
Hump to load themselves into the city
train, which had probably come in from
Parramatta or Homebush. Their tempers
would not be improved when they found it
already filled to the brim with suburban-
ites, while their own deserted express was
standing empty overhead. There would be
two staffs to maintain—one above and one
below. There would be two sets of repairs
and two separate lots of paint. There would
be two engines and two sets of carriages, re-
quired to carry the traveller to, say, King-
street, instead of one. The place down be-
low would require constant enlargement be-
cause there would be a steady demand that
traffic should go that way instead of stop-
ping short at the old loony Hump and Dead
End terminus, for the city line would suit
equally the few who want to stop at Red-
fern and the many who desire to go right
on, while the present terminus woud suit
the few only. Now the cost of enlarging a
subterranean station is enormous, and be-
yond a certain point enlargement would
probably be found impossible without risk
of the great white elephant up above falling
through with a crash on the head of its
humbler and more useful relative below. In
short, no matter which method of building
the Sydney city railway is adopted the pre-
sent crazy terminus is doomed. The only
question is whether the Government will
recognise the fact now and obliterate that
monument of folly at the least possible cost,
or whether it will only do so after wasting
a huge amount of public money on patch-
work expedients. Inability to look far
enough ahead is a costly characteristic. It
was that which brought about the present
difficulty, and caused Sydney to be afflicted
with a great public work which was prac-
tically dead almost before it was born. It
is now up to the Government to buy itself
a telescope and gaze at the future.
The Walls of Derry.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes about the
above-mentioned fortifications :
So Derry has fallen, and great is the fall thereof.
Even the great slump of Babylon seems poor and re-
mote by comparison. So does the day when there
were floods in Sheol, and the inhabitants had to flee
to the roof, and the Devil’s tail, hanging down
from that vast elevation, was carefully inspected by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch of
Venice, the Chief Rabbi and the Moderator of the Pres-
byterian Assembly, who reported that it was made
of unknown materials. The day of the ’Derry elec-
tion was the day when the bubble burst, and the
fraud blew up, and the bottom fell out, and the old
exploded dream girded up its loins and fled for parts
unknown. Derry was supposed to be the historic
centre and stronghold of that alleged “Protestant
Ulster,” which was never much more than half Pro-
testant and half Unionist at the best. It was the
dismal little city which was alleged to be hallowed
by memories of the siege and recollections of the
ghost of the Rev. George Walker. A few years ago
this sacred spot used to return Conservative politi-
cians unopposed. It really didn?t -seem worth while
opposing them. Then, at the election of 1910, a
Home Rule candidate ran the Unionist majority down
to 105, and it was felt that things were not what
they had seemed. Now a Home Ruler has captured
the seat after a stupendous -struggle, in which nearly
every qualified person voted, and one “moribund Tory,
brought to the field of battle on a stretcher, died be-
fore he had time to vote. The loss of Derry involves
more than the mere vanishment of - that dreary little
city from the Tory interest. It destroys the fiction
that Ulster is an anti-Home Rule province, which is
to be brutally sacrificed to the clamor of the three
Home Rule provinces—Munster, Leinster and Con-
naught. With the East Antrim seat vacant, Ulster
returns a Home Rule majority. If the Unionists re-
capture the East Antrim seat, the very best they can
hope for is that the province will be one-half Home
Rule and one-half anti-Home Rule. The other three
provinces are overwhelmingly in the Home Rule in-
terest. It is a case of 3A against a i. The special
trouble of the Unionists in Ulster is that their cause
is continuously on the down-grade. Its chief assets
now are its arrogance, its legends about the siege of
Derry—which is a very old siege, and which never
amounted to very much even when it was new—-and
the alleged gun with which it is supposed to drill
beside the pigsty after dark, with a view to putting
up a Homeric scrap in the day of trouble. And these
are dubious-looking properties.
The Six Hours Day.
There is a chance for deep thought and
spacious consideration in the fact that la!
week, the Political Labor League decided
unanimously in favor of a working day f
six hours. (It afterwards decided not t
put the six hours idea in the front rank of
its policy just yet, but not because it saw
the absurdity of the idea— merely because
the proposition might imperil the farming
vote at the coming election.) It a i gQ
expressed opinions in favor of the
abolition of overtime even with over-
time pay attached —another idea which
must tend to reduce the average producing
power of the community. Whether eight
hours sleep, six hours work, and 10 hours
argument or football or other recreation
constitute the ideal existence it is impossi-
ble to say. It is not even possible to sav
that there is any such thing anywhere as an
ideal existence. No definite hours of labor
are laid down by the Ten Commandments or
by any other scriptural authority, and the
question is purely one of policy. Sq long as
work doesn’t degenerate into slavery or
something approaching slavery, any old set
of hours that fits the case is good enough
from the biblical point of view. And, as
a matter of policy, pure and simple,
the verdict must be that the ■ six hours
scheme at the present juncture would be
blank insanity. During the year 1912 the
Commonwealth went to the bad, or to the
dogs or the Devil, to the extent of about
£14,000,000, solely through not doing enough
work to pay for the things it wanted. That
is to say, its exports failed, by that amount,
to pay for its imports and the interest on its
foreign debts. Either it didn’t work long
enough hours, or it didn’t work hard enough
during its hours of work, or too large a pro-
portion of the community didn’t work at all,
or else the community insisted on living on
an impossible scale of lavishness. One or
some of these explanations must be correct.
There should be a heap of rigid investigation
before it is seriously proposeu to knock per-
haps 25 p.c. off the productive power of the
community, seeing that the said community
was, last year, £14,000,000 short of the pro-
duction required to keep it decently solvent.
A plea advanced in support of the proposed
new departure was that, with a six-
hour day, “there would be work for all.”
But if anybody had sense enough to shut
down on a considerable section of the
outrageous heap of foreign, cheap-labor
goods which Australia pays for sp exten-
sively with borrowed money, there would be
work for 50 p.c. more than all even if the
eight-hours system was maintained. Pre-
sumably. it is intended that the artisan and
laborer should toil for six hours at the pre-
sent eight-hours rate of waeres. In that
case, unless there is a very heavy increase
in the tariff, there would probably be work,
not for all, but for hardly anybody. With
the present rate of wages the Australian is
so expensive a producer that foreign, cheap-
labor goods climb over his wretched little
tariff barrier wholesale. They climb over in
ever increasing quantities to deprive the
Australian worker of his job, and the climb
has become so enormous that it requires the
maddest foreign borrowing in all Australia’s
history to prevent the country being made
bankrupt by the outflow of mohey to pay for
its imports. If the Australian cuts down
his work by perhaps 25 p.c., and, conse-
quently, increases the cost of production by
the same amount, he will, under the existing
tariff, be still less able to compete with the
outsider. Local employment will diminish;
cheap labor imports will increase: the neces-
sity to borrow in order to pay for the sur-
plus imports will increase (and N.S.W. is
now borrowing at the unparalleled rate of
£9.000.000 a year) ; and then Cohen will
take alarm and stop the supplies, and the
result will be heroic Burst. After that, the
country 7 may either raise its tariff, and toil
longer hours for lower and cut off a
lot of its foreign luxuries, and resolve to
spend many dreary years in working off the
dead horse —or it mav default on its debts
and run the chance of the Imperial Govern-
ment suspending its Constitution and putting
in a bailiff or receiver. No. this is hardly
the time to start a six-hours working day.
Affairs just now are too precarious.
♦
Strikes and Debts.
A new line in the dropping of tools was
produced for inspection at (M.L.)
some few days ago, by the local "Waterside
Workers’ Union. It notified employers that
its members would work only half the usual
hours on the day fixed for the funeral of a
fellow employee, who had died from in-
juries received in the hold of a coasta
steamer. The notification had unusual sig-
nificance, inasmuch as it officially indicated
to the shipping cos. that members of the
union were of opinion that a great nunmjj
of accidents were preventable. Said tn
secretary of the men :- .
In 19 days recently there were 18 accidents,
venture to predict that, if we find it necessary
cease work in this way at all frequently, t ,e ( ore 1 *
the number of fatal accidents will be reduced
about one per annum.
Probably the new move was suggested by
what happened to Uncle Sam’s Steel irus
a couple of years back. In 1910-U ■,
Trust was induced to spend £350,000 in u
vising new methods for safeguarding ei -
ployees, and, as a direct result, there was
reduction of 43 p.c. in accidents. Ib at
to say, no less than 2300 men, who wo
in the old conditions have been killed
maimed, escaped. These were one yea -
figures. Similarly, in Australasia, there
in almost every big industry a casual
and carelessness on the part of both
employer and employee which demands
compromising suppression. But the c
and irritating policy of dropping t° ola .
odd intervals is not- the likeliest way
bring about a big humanitarian reform,
is about as bad for the employee as tor
employer, it is no good to the dead m
widow, and it does harm to Posterity,
country is continually borrowing m 7
abroad to pay foreigners for doing thei
it should do itself, and leaving the hi „
Posterity. And every time it. knoc.ks
work for half a day it is adding to
terity’s debt.


How Slander is Encouraged.
Thus the S. M. Herald (6/2/’l3), apro-
pos the findings of Justice Hodges, of the
Supreme Court of Victoria, in the Ciiinn
We venture to think that, as a result of this case,
Mr Fisher and his colleagues will be rather more
careful in the future to ensure that their adminis-
tration shall be free from all taint or suggestion of
partiality of any kind. n
In this case J. M. Fowler, M.P. for Perth
(W.A.), levelled six definite charges against
Chinn, of so serious a nature that the Gov-
ernment was forced to appoint a ttoyaJ.
Commission to inquire into them. Auer
what the Herald described as a painstak-
ing inquiry” Justice Hodges found, m
effect, that there was no evidence to justify
the bringing of two of the charges, and that
the four others were utterly baseless and
unjust. Whereupon the Herald smote
Chinn’s accuser very severely indeed, as
Although Mr. Fowler was not able to substan-
tiate his allegations to the satisfaction of the Judge,
we are quite su?e that he acted with courage and
public spirit in making the statements which he
lieved to be true. ,

down grade it has put up records, both in
the Federal and State Houses, in the mat-
ter of hurling round wild and unfounded

citizen, whatever Ins political views, the

point of view, likewise unjust and disrepu-

Many of these mendacities appear to origin-
ate on trams. That is to say, the man or
woman who has a grievance against some
more or less prominent person mentions
sadly that she heard, on a tram, that the
enemy had taken, say, to drink and wife-
beating. (Sometimes the genesis of the
rumor is associated with a train or a ferry-
boat, or: even, in a burst of originality, a
’bus or a surf-bathing shed, but mostly it is
a tram.) In a little while it is being freely
circulated that the Hon. So-and-So, M.P.,
has started a vast harem, become a chronic
dipsomaniac, and only visits his home for
the purpose of soundly flogging his wife and
any of ner elderly relatives who happen to
be on the premises, attempting to mitigate
her anguish. In 99 cases out of a hundred
the thing is malicious balderdash from be-
ginning to end. Also, in 99 cases out of a
hundred the victim has no practicable re-
dress. In the hundredth case, of which that
of Chinn affords a sample, a Royal Com-
mission or what not sifts the evidence and
puts matters on a fair and sane basis. One
might imagine that, hereabouts, Liberalism
would rise up and deal it out to the mis-
guided bellow-dramatist who had made
ruinous statements about a political op-
ponent on no evidence whatever —or rather
on no more evidence than one may hear
any day on any tram. Not so, however.
And one undesirable result is that the prac-
tice of irresponsibly assailing the personal
characters of public men is, for the first
time in the history of this country, develop-
ing into something in the nature of a popu-
lar sport.
The New Kind of War.
“Hullo” has a vision:—
The censored war-correspondents in the Balkans,
who, with the exception of one Australian biograph
man, never met anything more war-like than a
deputy postmaster in some obscure village 50 miles
from the front, and never smelt anything more ex-
citing than a cholera camp, are returning to England
without much news, but with a full cargo of blas-
tiferous opinions. Philip Gibbs, who represented a
London paper somewhere in the rear of the Bul-
garians, is the first man to discover the new sort or
brand of war that is bound to happen when a coun-
try with only the population of Bulgaria, or Aus-
tralia, is up against a horde of enemies.
“It was not merely an army that went to the
front. It was indeed the whole nation.” Aus-
tralians imagine that the victorious troops were pro-
fessional soldiers, marching in full uniform; but
most of .the Bulges were reservists and ragged regi-
ments of Macedonian volunteers, carrying their um-
brellas and wages, and towing behind them their
pack-horses and donkeys. But as most of them had
spent pleasant Sunday afternoons sniping anything
in sight that looked like a Turk, these heroes of the
umbrella were useful soldiers. And it was a clean
sweep that Ferdinand made of his nation. In the
last reserve —the men who are fighting now—are
boys of 16 and men past 60 years of age. Everybody was
mopped up—professors and artists, editors and gro-
cers and linen-importers and pub-keepers and plum-
bers and clerks; everybody young enough and old
enough to hump a gun was summoned. And there
were no deserters, for the Bulges knew they were
in the last ditch. Gibbs discovered among the mud-
stained men in the trenches, living on army bread
and army soup—and not two helpings of either —a
Professor of Literature and a Professor of Chemistry,
a leading actor and a poet.
This is the new sort of war—the sort of war that
an invasion of Australia will necessitate. In the
trenches on the slopes of the Blue Mountains the
war-correspondents of the future will find Bernard
O’Dowd in a mud-stained uniform, his Honor Private
Barton in charge of a soup-kettle, Corporal Holman
and Bill McLinen feverishly trying to pull an over-
turned gun out of a bog, Private James Fairfax
dieting trenches, Private Professor Brennan sniping
behind the cover of the dead body of a Wowser, Nor-
man Lindsay and Victor Trumper, bare-footed,
looking for likely boots on the dead bodies of. gro-
cer’s sasistanfs and members of Parliament, Regimen-
tal Cook Dill Mackey frying horse steaks, and an
assortment of Canons harnessed to cannons.
But this would be at least picturesque. There
are worse things in store for Australia when it gets
its taste of the new sort of war. The Bulgarian
Government, having taken all the men, proceeded to
take most of their property. They issued an In-
ternal Loan, and in return for a credit note, which,
in the event of national defeat, would never be re-
deemed, they took a man’s ox, if he had an ox, and
his team of oxen, if he was unlucky enough to own
one They took his carts and his grain, and any
other thing which might be stored in a f barn and
might be useful to an army in action All they left
were the women and children, the old grandfathers,
the dogs and the foreign Jews. .
So in Australia the cocky and all his belongings
would disappear, and the selections would be left to
forlorn and starving women and children. But the
Bulgarian women, being, of the right breed, did
pi tv themselves; and the plight of two men that
Gibbs found in one village, left conternptuouslv^ be-
hind because in their youth they had been too de
cate to serve their time in the ranks, was dreadful.
The women taunted them, and the children jeered.

Also in the new brand of war, no lists of w ourided
and killed are issued. No woman in Bulgaria is
allowed to know whether her man or her boy is
alive or dead. “It is cruel, but it is necessary said
a Bulgarian head-quarters officer. We do not wish
to dishearten the people by publishing the "umber
of their losses. Afterwards there will be time
enough for tears.” And the semi-official statement
of losses in dead and wounded mounts to 70,000,
but this is naturally not the full total. 1 he m

Everything that can be commandeered will be col-

The Plimsoll Mark.
“Te Bababantiko” : While, the congregation
is praying for those in peril at sea, 1 shall
read the lesson from the Book of Warning.
What shall it profit Australia s Navigation
Act if this’sort of thing be true (as I
affirm) ? Norwegian steamers, chiefly, are
chartered to carry phosphate from Ocean
and Pleasant Islands to Australia, usually
on long-time charter at low rates.. These
steamers are mostly small (comparatively),
and though they mark Plimsoll line, it
doesn’t matter much whether it shows above
the tide. I have for several years loaded
said steamers at Ocean Island, so I ought to
know. One of them has been in the trade
for nearly seven years. Though fit to carry
only say'*looo to 1100 tons deadweight, she
has often taken in over 1400 tons. Finally.
Cant. Quayle-Dickson. Res. Commissioner,
took a hand and made some little restnc-
tion. But even now the ship loads anything
from 1200 to 1300 tons, which is excessive.
Another foreign-owned craft went one bet-
ter—or worse. On one trip (I loaded her)
the mate sent me word he would not go to
sea if any more cargo was sent off. The
captain had previously told toe “he came for
a cargo, not a sample.” She took 19 days to
Sydney that trip (average time for that
kind of tramp, 11 to 33 days). Now, I’m
not over-anxious about the foreigners; but
these steamers always carry a number of
passengers, employees of the co., who dare
not refuse to go to sea in them. And those
passengers are mostly good Australians, of
whom we haven’t got too many. Japanese
steamers in great numbers also load there —-
for Japan mostly—and equally ignore the
existence of their Plimsoll. When the cap-
tain of the Ujina Maru signalled me he had
his full load, his Plimsoll was Ift. 6in. under
water. They slowed down a little when
one Jap steamer, similarly laden, failed to
reach Dai Nippon. She has never been
heard of since she left Ocean Island, although
it is fully six years ago.

Royal Commissions and Sucli-like
Futilities.
From the S. M. Herald (23/1/T3)
The N.S.W. Cabinet has decided to dissolve the
Royal Commission on Food Supplies, which has been
sitting for the last 18 months. The chairman, Mr.
T. R. Bavin, has been appointed sole commissioner,
with instructions to conclude the inquiries by May 31.
It is a wonder this sound move wasn’t made
about a year ago; another wonder is that
the N. S. Wales (and other) Cabinets
haven’t long since dropped the practice of
appointing mixed Commissions to inquire
into things. They cost a lot; and they
never establish anything of value. A pro-
position is afoot, say, to Found a Municipal
Tripe-market on a Freetrade Basis. The
Government, lacking the nerve to make any
definite move in the vast matter on its own
account, selects three or four Socialistic
Protectionists and three or four Tory Free-
traders, and requests them to bog in and
decide the affair among themselves at so
much per sitting. The solitary issue on which
all are unanimous is that fees are sweet.
For the rest the anti-Socialists spend most
of their time taking subtle points against
the municipalisation of anything whatever,
what time the other lot barrack irrelevantly
for the socinlising not merely of tripe, but
of lights and livers and kidneys and every
other part of the animal.' As is always the
case where people argue privately,_ on poli-
tical or religious questions, relations pre-
sently grow strained. Just as things are
getting thoroughly unpleasant the Commis-
sion starts on a lengthy tour with the ob-
ject of personally inspecting the Socialistic
tripe-markets already in existence. _ Phe
further they proceed the more embittered
they become. Their minds have long been
irrevocably made up. The. pro-Tripe sec-
tion would not yield a point that would
gratify the anti-Tripe crowd to save their
(the pro-Tripeists’) immortal souls. How-
ever, they continue travelling, and arguing
and investigating with their eyes firmly
closed in a manner of speaking; not that
they seek new ideas, but because these deeds
represent easy money. The efforts of the
N. S. Wales Tote Commission were a record
of cynicism and audacity in this line; but
other bodies of the sort have, at any rate,
approached the Tote-investigation ramp or
swindle. Sometimes, as in the case ot the
Tote Commission, the thing is dissolved in
an evil-smelling atmosphere of boodle and
rampant suspicion ; at others (vide the just-
dead Food Commission) the end comes with
no more than a vague public sensation that
a number of rather futile citizens have
abandoned a job for which they never had
any qualifications anyhow. V\ ithout excep-
tion, intelligent people are agreed that in
all these questions one trained investigator
is of more value than whole sties of guinea-
pigs.
r—
The Tory press, when it wants to give some
sort of a boost to the old colored-labor
fetich digs up some incredible witnesses at
times.’ Thus the Sydney Evening News
recently broke out with big headings like
thls TRUTH about japan.
POPULAR FANCIES DISPELLED.
A CULTURED PEOPLE.
Then it proceeded to expound the views of
one Albert Warner, a Sydney trader of
some sort, who has just returned from Nip-
pon. He enthused at great length about
the domestic virtues of the Japanese, which
mav or may not, exist; and about their capa-
city for making beautiful but useless orna-
ments in metal and lacquer. They didn t
invent railways or telegraphs or phones, or
steamships or airships or road-making or
printing, or up-to-date weaving and spin-
ning machinery, or modern metal-working
methods, or modern medical and surgical
ideas or any darned old thing among the
essentials of modern civilisation, but their
equality, if not their superiority, is shown
by the'fact that they know a lot about lac-
quer According to the Evening News in-
terviewee, the only hope for Northern Aus-
tralia where the white man has been flour-
ishing for several generations, is to bring
these B cold country people into it. Furthei-
more this person assured the News that
“we ’have Freetrade with Japan which,
anyone who knows the huge Japanese;
tariff, and the Japanese laws which prevent
the white man owning a scrap of land in the
country, and shut him out of almost every
Japanese trade and industry, seems a shock-
ing example of misplaced cheek. And if
war comes between Australia and Janan
the News’s informant clamored wildly.
“What could 4.000.000 do against
78 000 000?” Where this human marvel
/earned that there are only 4 000.000 people
in the Commonwealth, and how he swelled
the Japanese to 78,000.000. the Lord only
knows But he assured Australia at large,
per medium of the News, that if we let the
Japanese into Northern Australia there
would be no fear of them coming south, for
“the Great Powers would compel Janan to
observe the conditions of her entry into Aus-
tralia ” The letters from the Great Powers,
which the speaker doubtless had in Ins tail
pocket, authorising him to nledge them in
this tremendous fashion, were, unfortu-
nately, not produced. Just here a horrible
thought arises. Perhans it was all hot air,
and no great Powers had assured Warner,
even bv a postcard, that they would spend
in making Japan keen ff»Ph with Anselm
any more than they did in making it keep
faith with poor old broken Korea. If that
is so, someone should point out to Warner
that it is possible for a mere shopkeeper to
go chucking great Powers around too reck-
lessly.

“0.K.” writes: —
From an Australian point of view, the most
humorous absurdity of the Suffragette rebellion in
Britain is its political blindness. The women who
break windows, drop lighted fusees into letter-boxes
and fling pepper into the eyes of inoffensive
policemen are mostly Tories of the deepest dye by
birth and education. They have no idea of bringing
millions of votes to the support of the Labor party,
as will happen when the Sex gets the suffrage
through their rowdy endeavors. Australian cham-
pions of the movement knew what to anticipate at
the polls from the Emancipation of Woman, but the
British suffragettes are fighting for a cause without
the least suspicion of what its effect will be. The
Women’s Leagues they have in view will be as dead
opposed to Socialism as the leagues hereabouts, com-
posed of fat dames and lean spinsters, who never
began to take an interest in politics until they
learned that vulgah women workers in all directions
were voting the same ticket as the vulgah working
men. A painful awakening awaits the militant suf-
fragettes. They are fighting the battle of the work-
ers, and they don’t know it. Neither do the work-
ers know it as yet. They only know that the well-
to-do “ladies” who suffer the indignity of being
forcibly fed in a prison cell are not suffering it on
behalf of the community in general—not knowingly,
that is.
“Rurtj” .writes: —
The proposal of James Allen, Maoriland Minister
for Defence, that the I O U-land should place an ex-
peditionary force of 8000 men permanently at the
disposal of the Dearoldmotherland is pretty much in
keeping with the presentation of Dreadnoughts and
other business dear to the heart of statesmen who
like to shine in the list of Birthday Honors. There
is, however, a single point about it that mav be
worth considering. Britain, with her huge black-
and-tan empire and her enormous and complicated
interests, has generally a small war or two on her
hands, and if Maoriland officers can get a little
practical insight into the bitter game as it is
played, it may help them to lead their own forlorn
hopes with more skill when the enemy knocks at
the back gate and the ships presented in the name
of Empire are far away. On the other hand, the
idea of getting practice for the sake of knowing
the game in a business as horrible as minor warfare
generally is will hardly appeal to the average
Maoriland citizen. If Allen is anxious to give the
Peace Society and other foes of compulsory mili-
tary service real grounds for complaint, he is going
the right way about it. All along the claim has
been honestly made that Maoriland is arming her
citizens for peace, but who can possibly describe a
force as armed for peace which may at any moment
be called upon to engage in a war in which it has
not the least interest, and which may even be con-
ducted for the sake of something which is wholly
distasteful to the Maoriland people? As a case in
point, Britain might go to war with China over the
old, disreputable opium question—it is exceedingly
unlikely, but stranger things have happened—and
the permanent expeditionary force from the Shaky
Isles would be a convenient one to send to help in
the dispute. Certainly the Maoriland Dreadnought,
if on the China station, would be in it, and why
not also the sons of the people who pay the interest
on that piece of ironmongery? Then Maoriland
would be called upon to assist in a great wrong or
to rend the silken ties of Jingoism or something.
In any case, Allen’s new proposal gives the people
who are opposed to defence an opportunity to scream
which they never should have been given, and
weakens the standing of every honest and sane, advo-
cate of a citizen army.

“Liberalism’s” new leader in Australia,
Joe Cook, snarled at Socialism a few days
after Deakin took the political count. The
muddle in Sydney’s municipal fish market
led Joseph to remark that the Socialists
couldn’t run even a fish market successfully.
Of course, Cook knows that Sydney’s City
Council has about as many Socialists in its
composition as the Legislative Council or
the Farmers’ Union. But a little thing like
that doesn’t matter to the barrackers for
Pirate Enterprise. As a matter of fact, it
is a herd of prime anfi-Socialists who are
behind the present unsatisfactory state of
affairs in Sydney. At Wellington (M.L.),
where at least the Mayor is by way of being
a Socialist, the citizens have been congratu-
lating themselves on the success of a Social-
istic venture of the same sort. It was a
success from the start, too. The first quar-
ter’s report showed that it had supplied
cheap and wholesome fish to the people,
paid good prices to suppliers, cleared all ex-
penses and interest, and put away a small
surplus. The average purchase was a retail
shilling’s worth, and that provided the pur-
chaser with a little more than Jill, of fresh
sea-food. The only trouble has been with
the supplies Ur the market, and if the re-
sponsible party (good old P.E.) does not
shake itself up a bit the Council will con-
sider a scheme of doing its own ■'trawling.
Meantime in Private Enterprise’s fish mar-
ket in Sydney a few of the prices 'quoted at
time of writing were: Schnapper, od. to Is.
ped lb.: jewfish, 6d. to 9d. per lb.; flounders
and soles. 3s. to 10s. per dozen; lobsters.
16s. to 18s. per dozen; and so on. And
those are far. far from the prices the con-
sumer has to pay the retail-shop pirate.

This is the reported statement of Robert
Williams, one of a band of Welshmen who
settled in frigid Patagonia, but found social
and political conditions uncongenial, and
sent a delegation to inspect the Northern
Territory: —
The Territory is a white man’s pountry. Though
spoken of as “tropical Australia,” it is really only
sub-tropical. The northern portion,, within the mon-
soonal area, is never subject to drought, but has regu-
lar summer rains. . . .He was impressed with crops of
maize which had not received a drop of rain from the
time they were sown The possibilities of sugar-
growing are distinctly good, samples of cane already
grown having yielded a high saccharine test. . . . The
climate he found extremely healthy, am), it seemed to
him that the, Territory gave as much, in return for six
hours’ work as land in cooler climdtes did for eight
hours’ work. There were no pests to be eradicated
nor any heavy timber to be cleared before the ground
was ready.
He further assures his fellow Welsh-Pata-
gdnians that “no such inducements as the
Territory offers have ever been held
out to white settlers.” All evidence seems
to point to the fact that the N.T. has higher
uses than the mere glorification of a horse
doctor.

The shameless party press battlers fell with
a dull, nauseating thud soon after the Aus-
tralian Government took over the State dock
at Port Jackson. A large item of news ap-
peared in the Sydney press and elsewhere
that considerable numbers of men had been
«acked. and the party jackals howled at the
door of Minister for Defence Pearce. After
considerable racket, Pearce got in a word
that the Commonwealth Government had no-
thing to do with the dismissals.. so the pack
turned on Griffith, Works Minister in the
N. S. Wales Labor Cabinet, and went
through the performance once more. Then,
by accident or condescension, the facts were
The Curse of Kingship.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Remembrance of an olden tale have I
In which Jeiiovah unto Samuel said :
“The people have rejected Me, and cry
For Saul to be their very King instead.
“Go, tell them that the King will take their
fields,
And claim their sons and daughters for
his will;
And of their cattle and their harvest-yields
Demand his servants’ and his soldiers’ fill.
“Go, tell them they shall work and waste in
woe.”
And Samuel told them ; but they heeded
not.
And through the ages we have come to know
The curse of kingship is our common lot.
It is but yesterday a farmer reaped
A thousand bushels from his fields of corn ;
Yet, with his harvest by the thresher heaped,
He went as one unhappy and forlorn.
For at his door the agents of the King,
And of the little kings of rent and trade
Knocked loudly, crying: “Unto you we bring
Our authorised accounts which must be
paid.”
And from the wlieaten harvest of his hands —-
For him and his no more than simple
store —
They took requital full of their demands,
And left him hungry at his open door.
And, furthermore: down yonder mountain
way
A farmhouse nestles by the waterfall;
And there each morning ere the dawn grows
gray
Shrill voices of the little children call.
And from the haze the lowing of the kine
Makes answer, till, as mellow morn pre-
vails,
Wee images of Him we hold divine
Like infant ghosts bend humbly at the
bails.
Oh! Ask me not the world-old question why.
The motherhood of mental death is there ;
But they who drink the milk of profits dry
Have honey added to their ample share.
For Saul is King. And we have built a
throne,
With little kings to guard the pedestal,
And round about the palace walls have
grown
Great cities that are open unto all.
They drink the vigor of the open plains ;
Thev burn a mountain as a lucifer ;
They hold the rivers as with driving reins,
And make the wind their passive messen-
ger.
But men who enter and would know the
King
Must throw their native honesty away,
Must clip with sophistry compassion’s wing.
And trim the truth to patterns that will
pay.
Must be the press to crush the grape of life;
The feet to tread the skins in fetid mud ;
The vats to hold the Sacrament of Strife—
Red wine—red wine that is the people s
blood.
QUEENSLAND.

allowed to appear. These showed that the
non-political Dock Committee, naturally
anxious to finish all jobs in hand by January
01. had taken on extra men. After" that date
the staff was reduced by the discharge of the
temporary hands from 1289 to 1219. The
Tory barrackers were apparently so ashamed
of the injustice they had done the Common-
wealth and State Labor Governments that
they said no more about the matter except
to print the explanation in an unobtrusive
paragraph.
Tiie most deplorable feature of the Scott
expedition to the South Pole or thereabouts
was the secrecy of the party which reached
Maoriland on Monday as to what had actu-
ally happened. The Australasian public was
first told that the expedition had returned,
and that it was surmised from the bearing
of the M.L. agent that there had been neither
death or disaster. Further than that, no
information could be gleaned. Then a mes-
sage reached Australia that Lieutenant Pen-
naix and Dr. Atkinson, responsible officers
of the expedition, who left the ship at
Oamaru, had stated that the Terra Nova
would reach Lyttleton on Tuesday or
Wednesday, “when Captain Scott would
give the story." Simultaneously with that
was published a cablegram from London,
that Scott and the rush party to the
Pole were dead, and. at time of
writing, there is little doubt of the
truth of the tragedy. To the Scott
expedition Australasia gave thousands of
pounds in cash and kind by its Govern-
ments and private citizens, and for that
reason alone it was entitled to know, at
least, the bare result of the Great White
Trek. But standing above that was the call
for a relief of the buxming anxiety of the
hundreds of close personal friends of Scott
and those (some of them Australians) who
went south with him. Yet not one line was
given as to the facts —indeed, it is clear on
the .cablegrams that plain, bald deceit was
used to withhold them —until a dividend-
making news agency in London could
“scoop" the story and count the profits. It
is an indecent episode, whichever way it is
looked for.

A deputation which wanted to talk about
the destruction of trees in and around Syd-
ney was lately standing, first on one leg and
secondly on the other, outside the premises
of Sydney's Lord Mayor, trying to get a
hearing. That sort of deputation has a
good case, but the subject is national, not
local, and the Lord Mare is hardly the per-
son to apply to. In fact, the Lord Horse has
no jurisdiction worth mentioning in the
matter. The reckless obliteration of forests
is one of the biggest questions of the age—
much too big for a municipal potentate to
cope with. The treeless land, unless it is a
dead flat, is a land that is bald, dead. bony,
blighted and accursed. Its soil has been
washed away, and it has become barren. It
presents a white skull and an unseeing eye
to the roaring gales of winter and the burn-
ing sun of summer. It has short-lived floods
and sudden droughts. Its rivers have vast
sandy beds dug out by the rush of the rain in
time of storm, for there are neither forest
roots nor alluvial soil to hold the waters
back, but most of the time there is only a
thread of water in a wilderness of sand. The
writer has seen two countries where the
forests have been practically destroyed. One
is Spain, which, except in the fringes, is a
dry bone of a land nowadays. It is mostly
rock. 3; It is scourged by sudden rain and
bleached by sudden glare. Its fierce floods
last for a day. and its spasmodic droughts
last for weeks. Its rivers are mostly half-
dead. and great Roman and Gothic bridges,
each obviously built to span a big river, now
straddle magnificently over nothing in par-
ticular. A similar land is old Judaea. All
the way from the Mediterranean to the Dead
Sea, and away east into Moab and Edom
there is. except alongside the Jordan, about
one shrub to the mile. In this land, once
flowing with milk and honey, the alluvial
soil has departed with the destruction of the
forests, and the dazzling limestone is ex-
posed. It is white like salt or leprosy—
white and baked, and it makes the eye ache
with the reflection of the sun. Nobody grows
anything worth mentioning on the denuded
region, and nobody is ever likelv to grow
anything till the Unspeakable Turk is killed
off and a sane Government spends
£10,000.000 or so on afforestation. No coun-
try can take a shorter road to Sheol than
bv the wholesale destruction of its standing
timher.

The S. Aus. Government has suddenly
decided to extend Parliament House right
up to King William-road, in accordance with
the plans made, but only half carried out. 20
years ago. The cost will be nobodv-knows-
what. but certainly half as much again as if
it had been done about 1893. so the idea of
the moment is to save £25,000 by dropping out
the dome of the original design. On which
comes a general cry that the solid block is
ungraceful, and has a monotonous skyline,
and that posterity ought to be considered.
But they need not worry an ut that. Pos-
terity will be considered all right: it will be

ney) on Saturday with a benign introduc-
tion from Bilanderson. There isn’t any-
thing new. strange or startling in the piece.
It does not attempt to tell the great stage
story that is waiting in the Australian bush
and mining camp for the right pen. although
to urge local story-writers or play-writers to
lay themselves out for the mysterious “typi-
cal Australian play” (or novel) which is so
constantly mourned for and even groaned
for. is senseless. Still, the play or novel
typical of Australian life (which is a
different thing) is a consummation devoutly
to be wished, or words to that effect. "The
Bush Girl is in four acts and 11 scenes
(too many), and throughout is hitched to
the waggon (in places traction engine) of
Drury Lane tradition. Which would be
right enough if the traditions selected as
models were not too often the very oldest in
stock. Something new in the wav of a
"situation” obtrudes itself at the close of
Scene 111., Act 2, where the villain and a
mounted police officer are foiled by half a
dozen toy scouts. While the hero gallops
to safety these sawn-off heroes hold a bridge
against the enemy with 30 rounds of hall
cartridge which had been served out bv the
low comedy man. This writer hesitates to
believe this damphoolishness was in the orig-
mal script. Nevertheless, the drama shows
that Jo Smith is on the track of the real
goods of the kind —strictly of the kind. There
is a story to hold the interest, and a
dash of excitement in the places where
it is calculated to do the most good. The
greatest difficulty the piece has to face is the
smallness of the Palace stage. The produe-

To be brained with a walking stick, then
chloroformed and locked in a safe, and
finally handed over to the tender mercies of
an insane doctor —to be, among other
things, slowly poisoned, and to come out of
it all alive and go home to your astonished
missus, is a record that would justify a
larger hat than even the most habitual Mar-
low' hero wears. Yet such, with a few other
oddments, is the nightly experience of
George Cross of the Adelphi. Moreover, he
has to put up with the worries and tor-
ments of a villainous cousin who would
come in for a large bank balance if the hero
were out of the way. And with an induce-
ment like this a villain and a willing female
helper can do a lot of damage. “The
Beggar Girl’s Wedding.” the AdeTphi out-
break which is responsible for this conduct,
is, with the possible exception of one or two
of the early attempts, the most Marlowdram-
atic demonstration the theatfe has seen. It
doesn’t succeed in being the least bit origi-
nal. and has no special feature to recom-
mend it. Even the scenery doesn’t reach
the usual Adelphi standard, though that
is not necessarily very
high. ’As "to the char-
acters, George Cross
(Jack Cunningham,
the ill-used hero) is
handed the bulk of the
pastry : the crumbs go
to T. W. Lloyd as Gil-
bert Lindsay, the
scheming villain, and
Nellie Fergusson. his
right hand. Nellie
Bramley would also
have a crumb and a
half if she didn’t
whine her Dart. Cer-
tainly woman and whine have been asso-
ciated for ages, but she is inclined to overdo
the connection.

The National Amphitheatre has a turn
this week that suggests an educated mena-
gerie. Eight dogs and four monkeys perform
feats that would baffle many a human batch
of 12. An alleged death-defier named Electra
allows thousands of volts of electricity to be
fired through him. The writer wasn’t im-
pressed by this. He went through the same
experience, the other day, as a means of
ousting an attack of lumbago. Let Electra
stand a considerably smaller dose of electri-
city—the amount, say, that is necessary to
drive a tram —and if he doesn’t become a
complete corpse, the writer will engage to
drop journalism an 4 enter the Church —that
is. assuming any ehprch exists that will have
him. De Lea and Orma make good, and
Charles King is primarily responsible for a
farce which appears to amuse the multitude.
The last milestone of "Milestones’’ will be
reached at Sydney Criterion to-morrow.
After that, the Julius Knight company will
present something which, from the adver-
tisements, looks rather like a modern version
of "Antony and Cleopatra,” or else a new
drug. This question will be cleared up in the
next issue of this valued and imperishable
publication.

"Banjo” Paterson's steeplechase poem.
"The Amateur Rider.” forms the basis of a
12min. dramatic sketch now being plaved at
a Balmain (Sydney) vaudeville show. A
bearded young man in the conventional stage
costume of the station overseer collides with
the extremely English rider, and, with the
condescension of the seasoned bushman.
treats him to some advice about the wonder-
ful Battleaxe horse. The harmless and
beautifully dressed foreigner then wanders
off to find Battleaxe and. his owner, and the
bushman proceeds to get excited and recites
the lines describing the 'chase. Battleaxe.
having been skilfully steered to victory off
stage, the harmless stranger wanders on
again, shakes hands with his blatant coun-
sellor. and implores him in the Australian
bard s own words. "Never to judge a man
by his clothes." The dissection of a horse
recitation for stage purposes is an unusual
experiment, and * sufficiently well-read audi-
ence would probably appreciate it better than
a scratch suburban crowd. The interpolated
dialogue seems to "go” better than the verse,
perhaps because the swinging Paterson lines
give the listener the idea that one character
is cold-bloodedly reciting to the other —an
intolerable and wholly unnatural proceed-
ing. Messrs. Pollock and Scarlett are h.
responsible pair. c cn e

that the sloping sward is obviously founded
on flights of steps, and the mob of little
elves are animated by the spirit of panto
mime ballet. Though their modern worldly
frocks and furbishings make a nretty color
scheme, the impression of eeriness is want-
ing. Which is not a disadvantage, perhaps
seeing that the general public delights in
ordinary high-class panto effects, and is not
troubled by ideals concerning elves and
gnomes. This is an interesting presentation
of Shakspeare’s masterpiece, so if the waits
between the acts have been reasonably short-

To everybody who remembered the charm
of Dora Rignold. as Oberon, the success of a
mere man in the character came as a glad
surprise. H. R. Hignett. with his personal
refinement and sweet, muffled tones, made a
convincing King of the Fairies. His elocu-
tion was a pleasure. Worloek and lan
Penny acted the mixed-up lover characters
better than they spoke the blank verse
whilst A. Onslow, as Duke Theseus, suffered
from boyishness, and Miss Olive Noble was
a thin Queen of the Amazons in all respects.
The most one can say for the mild, unmus-
c-ular lady is that she looked just about equal
to downing any two of her meagre Amazon-
ian guards in a catch-as-catch-can. Puck
(Miss Florrie Allen) partially atoned with
her youthful vivacity for her rather feeble
delivery of the lines. Miss Orton-Dring did
nicely as Hermia. although her voice also is
rather weak, and Miss Bray.ton. as gentle
Helena, easily first prize in the class
for ladies. Her beautiful appearance and
her first soliloquy captured the heart of the
house, nor did she ever relax her hold save
for the rare occasional moments when she
lapsed into her familiar monotone. Oscar

Nothing sordid or gross is allowed to in-
trude into the idyll, “At the Rainbow's
End,” which was a moving picture at Mel-
bourne Majestic on Saturday. The film was
a series of tableaux of Arcadian bliss —of
two lovers spooning with all the gentle sol-
emnity of the oldest inhabitants at chess.
“The Young Millionaire” was a drama of
True Love spoilt by a horrible lust for
£s. d ; while “The Grassville Girls” revealed
a hero with a taste for polite polygamy. The
English and Australian editions of the Ani-
mated Gazette were nerusing, and
“Tweedledum as a Commercial Traveller”
was a humorous satire on a class which has
done nothing to deserve the peculiar com-
pliment.
In Melbourne town the weeks em by,
Day cometh after night;
The sun and moon and stars on High
Persist in shining bright:
The songbirds sing, the maidens sigh,
The Wowser groans or rants;
The flowers bloom and fade and die —
And still the panto pants.
The milkman rises with the lark
When pressmen go to bed :
All toilers toil in liVht. or dark,
To earn their daily bread,
Whilst sluggards scornfully remark
The industry of ants,
And lovers smo™e around the park—
And still the panto pants.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Stargazer” : One feature of Oscar Asche’s “Antony
and Cleopatra” that jarred on my sense of fitness was
the rigid attitudinising of the Egyptian characters.
Cleopatra and her attendants cast the most absurd
poses, with flat hands turned at right-angles to their
bodies, and joints stiffly bent in ungainly and tor-
tuous ways. Is there any reason to suppose that the
Egyptians of Cleopatra’s time crumpled themselves up
in this inelegant and painful way? Of course, the
artists who decorated tombs, monuments and obelisks,
and the penmen whose handwriting has come down to
us on tiles, etc., pictured their models throwing stiff,
inhuman attitudes; but Mr. Asche has more sense
than to take the defects and mannerisms of primitive
artists working in an unwieldy medium as literal
transcripts of the people of their time. Otherwise he
must have insisted on an occasional Egyptian having
two eyes in his profile. Why, then, this departure
from the ordinary and natural hang of the human
man?
A very charming actress in Australia has been
receiving threatening letters from an angry woman,
who declared that her husband’s infatuation for the
stage-lady was driving her to extremes, and a climax
with guns in it might be expected at an early date.
The thing seemed so genuine that an investigation
followed. The husband was found to be a baker’s
carter, a plain little man whose hopeless passion was
taking him to the gallery six nights a week, and
putting a grievous strain on the family funds. The
husband has promised to abstain, and homicide is off
for the time being.
“Jean Sibi”: No doubt “the good old custom,”
mentioned by “J.F.H.” (B. 30/l/’l3), is a very dar-
ing proposition; but the subject is not new in Euro-
pean drama. Arthur Schnitzler, the Viennese, long
ago treated the same theme in “The Veil of Beatrice,
a blank verse tragedy giving-an entertaining bird s-
eye view of medieval erotics. Similar queer matteis
are not uncommon on the European stage, and I
reckon that anyone who has absorbed the full meaning
of “The Dead City,” by Gabriele d’Annunzio, or has
read that weird Dado’s “Dreams of the Four Seasons,”
will consider that Schnitzler and the author of the
custom are mere babes to him in sexual unpleasant-
ness. Yet even d’Annunzio’s sensualism pales into
purity in comparison with the lunatic concupiscence
of the decadent school of Russian drama. I could
mention two or three Russian dramatists —Sologub
and Zinovevva-Annibal, for instance —beside whose
works the most daring productions of modern French-
men seem but the soulful outpourings of a maid who
has never known Man.
A new view of the ecclesiastically-minded Glad-
stone, from Lord Malmesbury’s Memoirs, being an ex-
tract from the diary he kept when he was one of the
G.O.M.’s Ministers: “Gladstone is now quite en-
thusiastic about negro melodies. He goes about sing-
ing them with the greatest spirit and enjoyment,
never leaving out a verse. His favorite appears to be
‘The Camp-town Races.’ ” An Irish-Ameriean actor,
T. D. Rice, is, by the way, regarded as the founder of
negro minstrelsy. Business not being too good at the
Columbia Theatre, Cincinnati, Rice hit upon the idea
of giving, between the acts, an impersonation of an
old darky, singing “Jump, Jim Crow,” with an ac-
companying grotesque dance. The novelty caught on and
filled the theatre for many months. Then Rice took
Jim Crow to London, where he scored another great
success, but had to contend with several imitators,
one of the cleverest being John Dunn, afterwards a
well-known Australian actor and father of Marian and
Rosa Dunn (in later life Mrs. Marcus Clarke and
Mrs. L. L. Lewis, of Melbourne). It wasn t till 1842
that E. P. Christy organised the first company of
negro minstrels, and arranged the stereotyped semi-
circle. Christy’s company never left America, but a
member of it,' named Rainer, organised a troupe of his
own and showed in London. George Coppm brought
these musical blots to Australia, and as Rainer s
Serenaders” they made their debut in the old, Theatre
Royal (Melbourne) towards the close of the 50 s.
“Valentine Day”: “Melb” (B. 6/2/’l3) is

mour was the Titania; Bessie Colville the Puck;
Roland Watts-Phillips the Oberon; while Harry
Jewett, Arthur Greenaway, Kate Bishop and Manbel
Greenwood played the Athenian lovers. It was in
the revival of 1892 that Hilda Spong appeared.
The Taits’ new concert hall, in Melbourne, the

Ada Ferrar, Australia’s original Mercia and Joseph-

Otto Heggie, who started his acting career in Ade-
laide, has the leading part in a new London skit on

feited on the stage ; and Shaw and Barrie in person
watched it on the first night.
“Circle”: I only go to the local picture show
when my wife won’t allow me to stay away. The
strain on rather weary eyes is one of my reasons for
avoiding it, and the oculist’s advertisement on the
back of the pass-out check is another. The scenic,
industrial, historical and topical films interest me
faintly. But what an aching waste of time are
those dumb dramas where each scene flickers super-
fluously after the concise printed text, and the in-
sufferable “comics.” The white, soft fat of the actor
man, which makes him look absurd in working
clothes on the stage, seems to show up more than
ever when he is reduced to a flat, black and white
image on a screen. Last night I saw a fat actor
in miner’s clothes hit a mountain three times with
his pick. Then he had to mop his marble brow
exhaustedly and stumble away home. He had done
his day’s work realistically, that is, so far as the
fearfully limited resources of the picture machine
would allow. In order to get the alleged “dramas”
on to the reel, the eager imagination of the watcher
has to be fed with such meagre scraps. Eyes are too
scarce to wear them out much at the picture show ;
and the fact that the oculist finds it worth while to
advertise on the back of the pass-out check tells its
own tale.
“J.F.H.”: The London Opera House, the disastrous
venture of the New York Jew, Oscar Hammerstein,
has re-opened as a two-shows-a-day Variety hall.
Its new managers don’t go out of their way to con-
sult Hammerstein’s feelings, for the most .amusing
item on their opening programme was a burlesque of
grand opera —on the boards where Hammerstein sank
a quarter of a million in the vain attempt to estab-
lish the real thing. Before the rising of the curtain
the spokesman of the proprietors came oht—another
of the tribe of Nathan —and told the audience that
they meant to make it “an ideal family theatre, in
which nothing vulgar or degrading will ever be
seen.” The audience signified its approval in the
usual manner —and then sat down to the old dish
of dancing girl, trapeze business, grand opera bur-
lesque, and very ordinary music-hall turns, with a
quantity of cinematograph. On this showing it isn’t
at all certain that the shutters are down for good.
From London: Lord Kilconnel, the eldest son and
heir of the Earl of Clancarty, has just come of age.
He is the first of four children of Belle Bilton, the
music-hall “serio” of the ’Bo’s. When Viscount
Dunlo and Belle became closely acquainted, old Clan-
cartv packed his son off to Australia, and tried all he
could, including an appeal to the law courts, to pre-
vent the marriage. But it was no use; Belle was
made a viscountess in a London registry office, and
then went back to the ’alls. After a few years
Dunlo succeeded to the earldom and the debts, and of
recent years has been a familiar figure in the London
Bankruptcy Court.

“10-2-4” : The entente cordiale 3 which has existed
between Church and Stage of late years, is bearing
pood financial fruit all round. The Church gives a
nlav the free advt. of a blistering denunciation Of
course the public immediately flocks to the show.
The Stage reciprocates by putting parsons, clerics,
archdeacons, deacons, curates, vicars, rectors, bishops
archbishops, lav-preachers, vergers, moderators and
mere Wowsers “on the door.” The clerics as a re-
sult of watching and admiring the efforts ot the
mummers, are impelled to imitate them, rhus,
set the bellow-dramatic soul-salver, the type who
publicly froths at the whiskers at the thought ot
streets swarming with inebriated children, and opium
dens teeming with Caucasian maidens of respectable
antecedents and careful up-bringing. Needless to say,
these horrors are as imaginary as those which we see
portraved in “The Eye at the Keyhole, and similar
bloodstained productions; still, they pay by attract-
ing that vast section of the public which likes to have
its marrow chilled. The parson, under the influence
of the actor, is becoming a strenuous and skiltul selt-
advertiser. If he is a divine of any prominence he
has his every movement recorded in the press. Last
week a number of clerics played a cricket match.
They were photographed, and saw that the result was
reproduced in the illustrated papers, like any herd ot
vaudeville artists. The new spirit is well shown in
the texts which the astuter gospellers have taken to
using for their sermons. The old practice of talking
round a n<ece out of Jeremiah or Hosea or Mark, or
what not, has been abandoned. And wisely so. Under
this system a rather futile young parson, of the in-
tensely mild order, and handicapped by a bleating
voice and spots on the chin, was liable to select some
such upstanding text as “Lest he tear ray soul like a
lion, rending it to pieces, while there is none to de-
liver.” (Psalms vii. 2.) Inevitably he made an ass
of himself. The modern preacher does not go to the
Good Book for inspiration any more —that is, if he
aspires to obviate the monetary and other embarrass-
ment of an empty church. He either some
red-hot sectarian question, as the Bishop of Bathurst
did the other day, or he hurls himself violently into
the midst of an industrial dispute, as the Dean of
Newcastle did last week, and has been doing, on every
possible occasion, for months past. The effect in
both cases is magical. People flock to the show-
that is service—who never thought of doing so be-
fore. Infuriated arguments rage. Delirious admira-
tion and affection and embittered loathing are ex-
pressed for the star performer. He is advertised in
every newspaper in the State. He is a Success, nay,
a Scream. Here is a tip for the first stone-broke
cleric who reads The Bulpetim this week. Coming
from one who has made a close study of the thea-
trical business, it may have some value. Let the in-
digent one advertise that he proposes to discourse on
(say) “Andrew Fisher: Should he be Poleaxed? or
“Why I Have Decided to Extirpate the Papacy.
With any sort of luck he won’t see another judgment
summons for years.
The J. D. Williams people missed one glorious
chance. They would have had their houses crowded

Captain Scott’s Antarctic expedition has
corne back without its chief. If the cable
speaks truly he and a party reached the
South Pole (Poles are becoming quite com-
mon nowadays) on January 18, but a bliz-
zard mixed itself up with them malignantly
on the way back, and they all perished. Just
about here the advantages of wireless become
apparent. Possibly half a dozen bygone ex-
plorers attained the North Pole, but having
no wireless they couldn’t tell the world that
they were there, and as they died on the
back track for home only the white bear
knew the secret. Scott at least gets _ the
credit of his work. It isn t much, but it is
something.

The Oldest Inhabitant on a bit of oldest
history: — ,
There was a memorable meeting in Sydney on he .
8 1808, in the church of St. Philip, on the Rocks.
It was immediately after the arrest of Governor
Bligh and was held for the purpose of selecting a
delegate to go to England, and there state the griev-
ances of the people of New South Wales. Major
Johnston was acting-Governor. A proposition was
put before the meeting to present the Major with a
sword, “not to be of less value than 100 guineas, for
the wise and salutary measures he had adopted to
suppress the tyrannv which ruled the country. Mr.
McArthur was voted to the job of delegate ; a woman
gave the first vote. A proposal was then made by
Mr. Blaxcell that a fund be established sufficient to
pav McArthur’s expenses and buy the sword of honor.
Also, any few thousands that might be left over
should, it was decided, be used to purchase plate for
the officers who had composed the Criminal Court
and acquitted John McArthur of sedition. The following
sums were promised: Messrs. Lord, Kable and Under-
wood, each £5OO (Governor Bligh had sentenced
these to one month’s gaol and a fine of £lOO for
sending him an impertinent letter) ; Nicholas Bayly,
£lOO : John S. Gregory Blaxland, £200; Garnham
Blaxcell, £100; Captain Ebor Bunker, £2O; Eliza-
beth Driver (widow of John Driver), £3O; Isaac
Nichols, £5O (he became postmaster under the
interim Government) ; Rosetta Marsh, £2O (she kept
a pub in Pitt-street, and subsequently became the wife

“I was delighted,” said Mr. J. 0. Williamson on
his return to Sydney by the Orvieto, ‘ to hear that
‘The Sunshine Girl’ has been so successful here. And
it ought to be,” he went on, “because it is being
produced here on even a better scale than in London.
Not that this is any new thing. Our productions
are often finer than in London or New York No-
thing but the best will suit the Australian theatre-
goer.”—Press interview.
Some brands of butter never stale.
For years I’ve read this fine old tale:
“Our shows are of the best, you see,
Because they simply have to be.
“We would not dare to offer you
The stuff the Londoner sits through.
“The dull New Yorker with delight
Greets shows you would not stand one night.
“And patient Paris crowds to see
What here would mean insolvency.”
They’re fine, these advertising shouts.
But still I—well, I have my doubts.
Yet Old Experience softly sings,
“ ’Tis nice to swallow pleasant things.”
The butter? Thanks. I quite admit
I always liked the taste of it.

SOCIETY
BY MELBOURNE'S SAD SEA WAVES.
Persons of undoubted respectability were asked for their names and addresses for not donning some
additional apparel immediately they stepped from the water on to the shingle. They were not even per-
mitted time to dry their arms and shoulders with a towel. Complaint of unfair stringency was general
along the coast from Sandringham to Beaumaris, and there was not one knot of bathers which did not, as
the day wore, on, post its sentinels to give warning of “police in sight.” —News item.
The Musings of “10-2-4” : There is some-
thing appropriately futile and wild and illo-
gical about the story of the Rev. Arthur
Knight, who bolted from England with a
lady the other day, and is now on his way
to Australia. No one but a cleric could
have perpetrated so many absurdities in the
effort to lead the gay life. The arrange-
ments which he made for his bogus death
were splendidly parsonical. It is recorded
that before passing away “he laid his um-
brella on the grass.” Who but an English
clergyman would have worn a banal gar-
ment like an umbrella at such a moment?
Though the cable doesn’t expressly say so,
the odds are that he reverently deposited
his chest-protector beside the, umbrella, and
his bed-socks on top of both.' All being in
order, he sent his astounded wife to a farm-
house, and then “set off a flashlight and dis-
appeared.” The business with the flashlight
supplied that touch of bellowdrama, lacking
which the mystical mind feels that the sol-
emn episodes of life are barren and devoid
of significance. Having assumed the dis-
guise of a haircut (which appears to have
deceived no one who had seen him before),
he deleted two letters from his name and
started to learn poultry-farming. This, to
the writer, constitutes the crowning proof
of his unworldliness, not to say rank im-
becility? Have you ever tried to make
money out of poultry, gentle reader? It is
one of the surest roads to insolvency in all
the wide realms of commerce. He and his
lady friend also made dogged efforts to
learn to milk cows. However, they presently
chucked this as hopeless. The cows used to
turn round and look at them in the sad and
resentful manner which cows know so well
how to assume. This got on the operators’
nerves to an intolerable extent. Just before
retiring from the soul-salving game for good,
“the Rev. Knight conducted a successful
crusade against the white slave traffic.” A
Wowser, palpably. Your true Wowser can
see infamy in. everyone’s diversions but his
own. He had the sort of wife that divines
of his type seem to possess a positive genius
for acquiring. After the flashlight episode
the bereaved female went home, and, pre-
sumably, said nothing. Anyhow,
An impressive memorial service was held in con-
nection wjth her husband’s supposed death, at which
service the bishop of the diocese eulogised him.
She is reported to have made “objections” to
this ceremony, but since they were brushed
aside, one may take it that they bore no re-
semblance to the effective ones she might
have lodged. And now
An ecclesiastical inquiry into his conduct is to be
held in Leeds.
If this is done with complete solemnity, it
should provide a fitting last act to one of
the finest natural farces on record.

The Haw Hawthorn (Melb.) Bench of
magistrates has passed sentence on itself.
In October last one Henry James Maxwell
Thompson was charged before the Bench
aforesaid with having committed an indecent
offence. On the excuse of a paltry techni-
cality raised by defendant’s counsel the
honorary beaks dismissed the case, and 11.
•T. M. Thompson left the Court with his
friends. Subsequently the scandal was re-
viewed by a Supreme Court Judge, who
ordered a rehearing. Two counsel appeared
for defendant this time, but —
After hearing evidence, Mr. L. L. Philpott, J.P.,
said that the Bench did not wish to make much com-
ment. The evidence of the prosecution was con-
clusive. Thompson would be fined £2O, in default
six months’ imprisonment.
All things considered, the non-commenting
Bench let itself off as lightly as could be ex-
pected.
“Bloggs”: A strange, in fact almost un-
precedented, thing occurred in Casino last
week. A doctor was accused! of over-
charging a poor patiept. There are lots of
reproaches that may be levelled against the
medical profession with a good deal more
likelihood of sheeting them home than there
was, say, in the recent case of Brother
Chinn; but extortionate conduct is not
among them. I was sitting with half a
dozen doctors and some laymen once when
one of the company weighed in with a story
about the kindly way in which Blight, M.D.,
BY THEIR DEEDS SHALL YE
KNOW THEM.
"Who was that gentleman I just heard you
talking to? ”
"That wasn’t no gentleman, m’m—that was
the boss. He just come back for his latch-
key.”
had given up hours of his valuable time to
a stone-broke patient and asked no remu-
neration for it. “A d —d silly yarn,” said
one of the medicoes, and the others agreed
with him. To them there was nothing un-
usual in the conduct of Blight. Speaking
for my own part, I have sent two hopelessly
indigent persons to doctor-acquaintances in
the past couple of years. In the case of the
first the doctor paid about two dozen visits,
cured his man, and charged three guineas,
which I paid. In the second case, the un-
fortunate had to go into hospital. The doc-
tor paid various expenses for him there, sent
him away as well as he ever will be, and
lent him money to start fair up-country.
The borrowed and other funds were paid
back by instalments, as it happened (the
invalid being a conscientious type), but as
a judge of human nature, the doctor had
probably wiped the lot off, as a bad debt.
Of course, all doctors aren’t such complete
altruists. You get one, here and there, with
the soul of a Shylock. But that sort is rare
—almost as rare as the sort with democra-
tic leanings in political matters.

The ship Dimsdale, which recently
smashed the screw-pile light off Port Ade-
laide and drowned the two light-keepers, has
been writted by S.A. Marine Board for the
damage, the writ being nailed to the mast.
The claim is for a good dead more than the
old ship can possibly be worth. A nice point
for the defence might be, was there anv
sufficient reason for sticking a £20,000
beacon on a mere shoal? By an odd coinci-
dence, a Federal report, issued the very
week of the smash, recommended the spend-
ing of that very sum to buy three perfectly
good beacons elsewhere.
“Gerow,” after getting over the shock:—
N. S. Wales nearly lost its McGowen and half
the rest of its Labor members the other evening, it
happened during an interval of the Labor Confer-
ence, at a Harbor excursion arranged by the Labor
ladies on behalf of the yet-to-be-born “daily ” o n
board the ferry were five State Ministers' nianv
State and Federal members, and a herd or drove of
presidents and secretaries of leagues and unions and
delegates to the Labor Conference, with their women
folk. On the return journey, the overladen and ton"
heavy boat (most of the passengers were on the tor>
deck) was lifted violently by as much of the Pacific
as could squeeze through the Sydney Heads, and
struck by a wind that
had Buddeniy whipped
itself into a gale. The
boat was obviously
making a strenuous en-
deavor to turn over on
its side and deposit its
load in the Harbor
and for a few minutes
most of those on board
were busy recalling
their sins. But skill
and good luck pulled
the party through. The
Government of N.S.W
I’ll swear, is n ’ow
firmly convinced that
the distribution 0 f
passengers on harbor
ferry-boats should be
better regulated. On
hot summer nights the
people crowd on to the
upper decks, and,
given a sudden cranky
gale, and an unexpect-
ed howl from the ele-
ments, all manner of
thing’s might happen
Then the sharks would give three cheers and get to
work.
UNCONSCIOUSLY FUNNY.

About time the senseless game of going up
into the atmosphere supported by a bag of
hot air and falling down under an umbrella
was stopped by law. The latest performance
in Melbourne resulted in a smashed window
and a compound dislocatioq of the flying
owner of the brolly. In these days of aero-
planes and dirigibles, which, at least, serve
some useful purpose, this return to the days
of the drifting balloon and the falling gamy
has no purpose about it.
THE OUTCAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the life beyond there are spheres and grades of
being, just as there are here below. And, just as
here there are moral abysses between men, so will
it be there.
—Glorious dictum of the Rev. F. C. Spurr.
I sailed along through starry hosts
And reached the Land of Song;
I interviewed the leading ghosts
Amid the saintly throng;
But while their angel-voices cooed
In accents sweet and free,
I marked a lonely soul that stood
Beside the Glassy Sea.
In truth It was a sorry ghost
With scarce the heart to strut,
Nor could Its streaming whiskers boast
The fashionable cut.
Its draggled wings, I plainly saw,
Were all uncombed and thin ;
The battered trump within Its paw
Was small in size—and tin!
And, drawing nigh o’er pave of jade
Beside the crystal verge,
I noted that Its robes were made
Of cheap and nasty serge.
“Guide,” I exclaimed in grief and awe,
“How comes it, in the Skies,
Yon Angel, with the trump in paw,
Mopes in such shabby guise?
“Doth It in penance thus make shrift
For Sin, remote and fell?
Or is It d —d, and hath as gift
An holiday from H —11?”
Gripped me by hand that saintly guide,
And drew me from the street.
“Avoid the fellow, sir!’ he cried,
“He’s not of the elite.
“No doubt his mundane life was stored
With Faith, and free from sin;
And yet— r I can’t forgive the Loard
For letting of him in!
“Why, sir, he never owned a sov.,
No class had he—no clan;
He’s just the ghost”-—he shuddered—“of
A common Working Man!!”
His fluttering lids, in fear, he shut
As visioning that blight,
Adding, “I scarce need say we cut
The beggar dead, on sight.”
Deep-shamed, I slank from out the host
Of gemmed and silken sect,
Where gloomed that solitary ghost
Despised of the Elect—-
That abject shape, of whom the scoff
By Kerristian souls, betrayed
The fact that he was scarce a Toff
But of the Lower Grade.

A GOODLY JEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The King was greatly amused at the decorations
in the gunroom. Turning to Engineer-Commander
Turner, his Majesty pointed to the mauve, white and
green upholstery, and remarked that the gunroom was
more like a lady’s boudoir. This remark led to
general laughter. —From report of George V.'s in-
spection of the Maoriland battleship.
Inside the gunroom all could see
That something had occurred
To tickle his Most Gracious, he
Was obviously stirred.
A broad smile showed upon his face,
His eyes with mirth were bright ;
Each officer glanced round the place
In hope that he'd alight
Upon the cause of this ; but each
Decided that the joke
Was of a kind beyond the reach
Of any sailor bloke.
His Gracious wiped mirth’s tears away,
That damped his royal face.
And, chuckling still, he said his say:
“It seems to me this place
“Most like a lady’s chamber is!”
All present saw the joke,
A smile appeared on ev’ry phiz
And “gen’ral laughter” broke!

The stalking of the wily burglar has had
an amazing effect on the faculties of John
Hop No slightest clue now escapes his
meticulous eye —as witness the Sydney
police account of the discovery of a man’s
body at North Steyne Beach, Manly :
He wore a blue suit, soft blue shirt with white
stripes, black necktie, black Balmoral boots and black
60cks. . .
All of which any man might have noticed ;
but after that, observe the Sherlock- Holmes
touch: —•
A glass containing sand was found alongside the
body. His clothes were dry with the exception of
his boots.
That a glass should be found on the beach
with sand in it and that a man should be
discovered near the sea with his feet wet are
indeed enlightening facts With these clues
the mystery is solved. Obviously the man,
being afflicted with cold feet, committed
suicide by sand-poisoning. #
“Jearnes” on Clubs and things:—
The blackballing of Baron de Forest at the London
Reform Club, which was mentioned in the cables last
week affords another instance of the truth of Thack-
eray’s ttieorv, that to make sure of getting into any
club it is necessary for the aspirant to be unknown.
Baron de Forest is a millionaire, a citizen of good
repute,.a product of Eton and Oxford, an M.P., and
a prominent member of the Marlborough, which is
the King’s particular club, as it was that of his
father before him. Yet he gets “pilled” for an in-
stitution which is fairly reeking with members of
the very ordinary class. Of course, the thing has
not been done on social grounds. The Reform is a
Liberal club (nominally), and de Forest has, for
years, been committing the damnable offence of con-
sistently living up to his political Jabel. In England
the man who does this is regarded with detestation
by the members of his narty. A dozen years ago
Cecil Rhodes was put up for the Travellers’, one of
his supporters being the late King—then the Prince
of Wales. He was blackballed. The reason, expressed
in plain terms, was that he had been found guilty of
genuine Imperialism. He was known to have been at
the back of the Jameson Raid, which gave Britain
an excuse to add another diadem to the crown of
Empire. Of course, the Travellers, being good Im-
perialists to a man, turned him down with contumely.
The Prince and the rest of Rhodes’s influential friends
promptly chucked the Travellers for ever, just as Sir
Edward Grey, Churchill, Harcourt and others who
sympathise with de Forest, will doubtless chuck the Re-
form. But such protests are futile. The leopard does
not change his spots, nor do party politicians ever
cease from deceiving themselves as to their true sen-
timents. By the way, the S. M. Herald was quite
wrong (6/2/T3) in terming the Reform “the oldest
and most aristocratic of the Liberal political clubs.”
Perhaps the paper meant Brooks’s, to which such a
description might well apply. However, neither of
these resorts has been, 6trictly speaking, Liberal for
many years.
THE SAME THING.
THE L ADY: “Her husband isn't working , and
they've got hardly anything in the house
to eat."
THE GENT: “Oh, I see! She keeps a board-
ing-house, does she?”
The S. Aus. Supreme Court has had to
consider the exact effect of the words, i
have no time for you, you -immigrant, .
when used by an employer, lhe employei
said they were merely playful badinage , tne
immigrant took them as sufficient excuse to
quit instantly—in fact, he said he thought ie
was being told to quit. So he went, and t
employer—who, after all, didn t want to los
him—pursued him into the police court,
which said he was right to go. .Now tne
higher Court says he wasn t, and, instead ot
getting the sack, he is merely handed a nasty
parcel of Costs.
THE PUNISHER.
LONG: “You know, I’m a great judge of
whisky.”
SHORT: “ You don’t say? Hanged if I didn’t
think you were an executioner.”
The resumption of the suffragette cam-
paign in London reveals one or two new
features. There is more variety of outrage
than formerly, and a tendency to break out
in new places and employ new combustibles.
A few years ago the suffragettes used simply
to “demonstrate” outside Parliament House
under the supervision of a row of watchful
policemen. Every now and then a woman
would flutter out of the herd, rush sideways
at the force, cannon into Policeman Hex
and rebound off him, at the same time say-
ing tremulously: “Votes for Women!
Then came the great era of window smash,
the putting of blazing substances into letter-
boxes, the period when ladies chained and
locked themselves to the railing of the gal-
lery of the House of Commons and swal-
lowed the key, the hunger strikes, and the
throwing of dead cats at Ministers. Now
further improvements have been introduced.
Phosphorus and revolver cartridges get into
postal boxer Every member of the House
of Commons has received a letter filled with
red pepper, and pepper is being thrown at
policemen. One enormously agile lady, bear-
ing the ffbnt name of Margaret, broke 12
windows in the police court while she was
being tried —she must have leaped like a
young gazelle to do all that blue ruin before
the strong arm of the Law got her down and
sat on her —and also threw a bucket ot
water over a sergeant of police. 1 resum-
ably she had come into court with the bucket
of water concealed down her back. One
lady, Sylvia Pankhurst, rushed with an axe
at an oil-painting in a public gallery, and on
being sentenced to 14 days she threw an ink-
pot at a policeman and slapped a superin-
tendent with an inky but well-shaped hand.
But the strenuous ladies have not yet
adopted the idea propounded by Henry
Ilorsecollar,” in this paper, that they should,
under false names, rent all the empty houses
in London, and at a given moment—perhaps
2 a.m. on Sunday morning—should turn all
the gas and water taps on full and then lock
up the premises and go home by thousands.
Nor have they adopted the same writer s
proposal that they should all lure themselves
out as cooks or housemaids, and should,
earlv one Sunday morning, put all the
family food supply into the ash-bin, turn the
furniture upside down, pour water oyer the
missus’s best clothes, and depart leaving the
doors open that Bill Sikes might enter. Pos
sibly these airy jests will transpire later.
The last news is that a member of the Com-
mons, wants forcible feeding in gaol abol-
ished. If any lady wants to hunger-strike
he suggests that she should just be allowed
to hunger-strike. Perhaps the best idea
would be to exile able-bodied suffragettes to
Australia upon conviction. Many of them,
of course, wSuld hurry back, but many would
stav. They would have votes here, and, in-
cidentally, they might help to solve the

“Adelaide”: As to those “audaciously-

unashamed. A Venus treated with corres-

The long-drawn-out war between parson
and ex-politician Ronald and tea-merchant
Harper resumes in Melbourne, after being
quiescent for several years. Ronald mobilises
his forces, and charges Harner’s entrench-
ments with a claim for £lO,OOO on the plea,
as the daily paper puts it, that Harper
“fraudulently procured a verdict in the
Supreme Court” in the Ronald v. Harper
case of May, 1909—the case which had a
blaze of splendor cast upon it by the gaoling
of quite a number of witnesses for perjury.
The latest news about Australia’s mis-
placed and misbegotten Federal capital is
that it will probably be called “Myola.
“Myola!!” It sounds like one of the
sweetly pretty names that you see on sub-
urban cottages —the kind of cottage that
has two yards of grass an„ a small fat dog
in front,' and four yards of vegetables and
a fowl at the back. “Myola” is generally
occupied by a young couple with
and it stands between “Hazel Dell and
“Maudville.” The house opposite is “Ethel-
berta.” Why not try some vigorous, up-
standing name with a sort of brass-trumpet
sound in it —“Barabbas,” for instance V
There would be something loud and imper-
ishable about the City of Barabbas.
Unlucky for the motor-driver who ran
into a party of pedestrians on the Aspen-
dale (Melb.) road, and is now charged with
feloniously killing one of them, that he was
carrying two barmaids in the car. Lnlucky,
also, that the calamity happened on the
blessed Sabbath. Sunday and a pair of bar-
maids are the stereotyped essentials to a
Joy-ride, let the shover be never so careful.
Had he been driving a pair of lugubrious
old ladies to the house of a sick parson the
result might have been just as tragic, but
how different the light it would have ap-
peared in !

The local council is primarily responsible
for the slaughter of a doctor’s wife by a
motor-car on the Aspendale to Melbourne
road t’other Sunday. There is no sort of
defined footpath for pedestrians thereabouts.
Ratepayers complain that whereas a track
could have been made on one side of the
main road, anyhow, at small expense, it has
not even been cleared of trees and stumps,
l’eople walk on the unlighted road to avoid
the obstacles in front of them, and are ex-
posed to the risk of being run down by pass-
ing vehicles. And the local “progress asso-
ciation,” instead of clamoring for safe tra-
velling facilities, has been worrying only
about the morals of mixed bathing and sea-
side camping.
* * * *
A man and his lady recently went down
to South Melbourne to bathe. They had on
bathing costumes under their walking rai-
ment, and having shed the latter, they took
to the water. A horrified ,T. Hop. witnessed
this proceeding, and, when he had recap-
tured his breath, he told them they would
hear more anon. What they heard was the
voice of a shocked J.P. saying it would be
£2 and costs. The charge against them was
that they had undressed in a public place,
contrary to the municipal by-laws. If this
decision holds good, the damsel who goes to
the water’s edge in a kimono will be liable
to prosecution if she there discards it. So,
also, with the stout citizen who. up to the
time he enters the sea, wears an overcoat.
In fact, it may yet happen that the tender-
foot who does the journey to the waters
edge in sandshoes will be pounced upon and
fined in the interest of morality, or anti-
Socialism, or the One Thousand and T“n
Commandments, or something.
HIS SAVING GRACE.
ETHEL: "Why, Tom , you're not a bit de-
pressed. I was told you had put your foot
in it in connection with that big flotation
failure."
TOM (on 'Change): "I may have put my foot
in it, but not my oof."
THE SIN OF PROVIDENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was with a good deal of surprise that the mem-
bers of the Water Commission read yesterday that a
meeting of Methodists at Shepparton had carried a
motion denouncing the practice of Sunday watering
on the irrigation settlement as inimical to the best
interests of the community. —Melbourne Age. j
The sainted Wowser rose in gloom
Upon the Sabbath morn,
And, from his sacred sleeping room,
He cast a look of scorn
Out through the window, and his eye
Beheld a dark and stormy sky.
His stern demeanor deepened then,
His lip grew longer still,
And when he heard a worldly hen
Set up a cackle shrill,
The giddy, Sabbath-breaking bird
Called forth a disapproving word.
With blistering curse the Wowser’s spleen
Was vented on the fowl.
Then, having swabbed his visage green
And dried it with a towel,
He sadly drew his trousers on
And breakfasted on tea and scone.
And, as the first unjoyous toll
Of church bells woke the town,
He heard the sinful thunder roll,
And then the rain came down —
Came down in bucketsful and sheets,
And muddied all the Sunday streets.
“What’s this?’’ the Wowser cried in ire.
“Rain on the Sabbath day!”
He viewed the dim, enshrouded spire
That seemed so far away.
“This is,” he said, “a sinful shame !
And Providence is much to blame!’

II is true that Labor has from the
first sunk the fiscal issue. Had it made
the tariff the first and the last question
in its profession of faith, it would never
have arrived at a position of |K)wer at
all. It has no fiscal policy, and has
never professed to have one. The Lib-

“Te Babarani Iko” : More or less frequently
an “expert” gets up and explains that the colored
races of the Pacific are dying. He is convinced of
this because the brown man is not at all anxious
to toil for some planting or other syndicate out
for dividends with both claws. Let me put the
“expert” in the brown man’s place for a minute.
On his island he need but tickle the soil and it will
flow over with the food his appetite desires. Why
should he go to hard yakker to earn it from a co.
that will see he pays for it in labor 10 times over?
I dunno. The “expert” says he knows because he
is acquainted with brown brother’s mind. Kittens!
The fact is, no white man ever understands the native
mind. Even the white man who for years has lived
among him, and speaks his language as well as him-
self, has to admit that under a given set of circum-
stances the native often acts just opposite to what he
expected him to. This dying-out-of-the-native yam
is, undoubtedly, untrue. The Pacific Islander, under
the white man’s control, is holding his own, and
even increasing his population slowly. Of my per
sonal knowledge I believe that to be so even of the
Ladrone Islands, which are usually regarded as a
particularly horrible example. I know positively
that it is true of many r tolls.
“Splodger": I notice “Foe” advocates a
close season fo.r plum pudding and duff from Sep-
tember to May. I enter a protest weighing half a
ton mixed without baking powder or fat. God help
the men who would try to enforce that law!
Mulga Joe, Saltbush Dick, and their mates at the
Overflow would give them a warm time. I remem-
ber more than one Christmas when the only dishes
between us and starvation were damper and duff.
It’s right enough for you town exotics, who can
pop in next door and buy a pen’o’th of fruit and
get a feed of beer. But what about us! Many a
time, at the Back-o'-beyond, cheerful and smiling we
sit down to a belly-full of good old duff, and glad to
get it. It’s full of staying power, especially if
mixed by a heavy hand with a shoulder-o’-mutton
fist. No, sir! Duff, formerly one of the mainstays
of the British Lion (now, alas! becoming extinct),
is become the corner-stone of the Australian kan-
garoo.
* * * #
“Yannatherra”: “Gouger” (B. 23/1/T3)
travelled to an out-of-the-way district to discover
that fly-eating orchid. I could have taken him to
observe hungry examples of the vegetable without
going out of sight of a northern Victorian pub. The
carnivorous blossom would be a boon if its tucker-
bag comprised flies only. Unfortunately, it assimi-
lates bees just as thoroughly, and almost as often.
The species met by “Gouger” is apparently the Fat
or wholesale member of the family; anyway, the
Victorian novelty closes its jaws on only one insect
at a time. I once experimented on the strength of
its gastric apparatus by capturing and inserting a
March fly. The bloom made a fine attempt at glut-
tony, but died of peritonitis. To completely remove
all traces of an ordinary household pest, including
germs, takes a non-dyspeptic blossom one hour and
a few odd minutes. Approximately 1 hour 30min.
reduces a hard-working bee to invisible plant-
fertiliser.
“McNorth”: Allow me a few words of
protest against “Mallarapoonie’s” description of
Cape York (B. 12/12/’l2). If “ ’Poonie” will come
ashore at Australia’s flag-pole, I’ll be glad to take
him gently by the hand and show him the scarcity
of the “dreary waste of low-lying sand
tracts,” etc., that he writes so glibly of.
The country, which has a salubrious cli-
mate and a rainfall of 70in., and has
never had a drought, does not wear an
expression of desolation or despair. Of
course, there is no railway station, im-
posing town-hall or picture-palace, and
the inhabitants number only about half a
dozen; still it is pleasing to sit on the
verandah after a hard day’s toil and
gaze on the sapphire-liued water of the
Strait dotted with numerous islands, and
reflect that some day population will
settle and thrive in our Farthest North.
The only fly in the ointment is that the
population may be Japanese.
“H. J.E.”: In re the Tasmanian
cocky. The north-west coast of Tassy is
absolutely the pick of the Commonwealth
for agricultural pursuits, the greater por-
tion of the land being very rich basaltic
soil, with a never-failing rainfall. Yet,
with all the natural advantages, some
cannot make a do of it. If they had
to struggle against the occasionally ad-
verse conditions that annoy the mainland
cockies, the great majority would be
always up against it. Most of the early
pioneers were English country folk, and,
as several generations since have had no
opportunity of education, a large per-
centage can neither read nor write. Cer-
tainly, things are mending. The State
schools are reaching most of the present
generation; but dairying is also spread-
ing, and you know what sort of a barrier
that is to the progress of the young
mind. Prior to the curse of Federation,
nearly every cocky was in a knot with
the bank and storekeeper. Federat ; on,
combined with bad seasons on the main-
land for spuds and oats, aid much to
dreg him into a comfortable path with
occasional luxurious trimmings. But he
is a slovenly, dull-witted person yet (you
can see that in in his politics), and it
was because of the lack of a little care
and the small additional expense of obtaining a
change of seed potatoes that the Irish blight recently
roosted on the spud fields. At least, that’s my
view; but quite a number of the cockies blame
Federation.
“Platman” : York Peninsula men snv
that the most deadly snake in Australia is a brown
crawler that has its habitat in their locality. It has
remarkably large scales, and grows to a length of
between 7ft. and Bft. A Rokely station man told me
that he has known one to bite a beast between the
hock and the heel (the skin is pretty thick there),
and the beast dropped in less than five minutes. The
niggers are very much afraid of them, and don’t
relish going through long grass, sword-grass especi-
ally. I killed a couple of snakes on the east side
of the Coen range that were new -to me. The
ridge was granite-faced, and the body color of the
reptile was a tawny yellow, that blended well with
the rock and dried grass. The head was black,
marked with small round spots of the body color.
It was a very long head and sharp-pointed, much the
shape of a greyhound’s muzzle. Both specimens ap
peared to be full-grown, and were about 18in. or 20in.
long. Anybody know their moniker?
FULL AND PLENTY.
SHEARER (seeking a pen): “Is the board full here?"
NEWCHUM R OUSEABOUT: “By Cripes! Five meals a day!"
“Mimosa”: Re “J.G.’s” par(B. 16/1/T3).
My experience of blacks and bees has been in
S’Africa, where I have watched Kaffirs and Hotten-
tots take as many as 15 hives in a day without sus-
taining a bung-eye or a thick lip, and they used no
more smoke than came from the pipes in their
mouths. They told me that when bees stung them it
only itched for a few seconds. As regards the sting-
ing quality and power of this particular breed of
insect, the Scots Greys Regiment was unfortu-
nate enough on one occasion to ride into a bee
laager which I had been prodding up, and the
cavalry men suffered a dreadful defeat. They fled
faster than De Wet ever did. By the way, can any
Abo. authority give me a reason, based upon
sound scientific knowledge, why bees so dislike
sweating horses?
» * * *
“Ginger” : I nominate the chap who sews
behind a chaff-cutter as the solidest grafter within
the four seas. Between Ganmain and Coolamon a
bag-sewer does from 600 to 900 a day, putting in
about 27 stitches per bag. Sewing, say, 87 bags an
hour for 10i hours is pretty hefty toil; but that is
the easier half of the job. The sewer has to stack
those 87 bags per hour, and 5 p.m. finds him
tossing them 12 bags high, and doing it at the rate
of two per minute. Incredible, but true. He gets
insulted with eight bob a day and tucker for the
performance.
NEIGHBORLY AMENITIES.
THE V ISITOR: “ I've come to slap your dirty
face, Mrs. Jones; I’ve heard you've been
taking away my character again."
THE O THER: “And it's a dirty lie they're
tellin' about me, Mrs. Smith—I c'udn't
do it!"
“Mimosa”: Since the appearance of
“Leichhardt’s” and “Pot Brook’s” pars (B. 16/1/T3)
in answer to mine (B. 5/12/’l2), I have heard of
an authentic case of a long-distance ride “off the
grass.” It was done some time in the ’6o’s by
Henry Thorn, then living at Warra (Q.) ; he was a
b-other of the late “Old George,” a one-time Pre-
mier of Queensland. Hearing of his father’s illness,
Harry Thorn rode a chestnut gelding right through
in one night from Warra to Normanby (Q.). The
distance, as I work it out, was nothing short of 124
miles, for he travelled via Toowoomba, and must
have had a rough passage across two ranges. The
horse was called Morgan; the bushranger of that
name was his previous owner.
* * » *
“Te Babarantiko”: Presuming that
“Flinderino” (B. 16/1/’l3) means the tridacna
clam, it would be difficult to give the weight of the
largest found in Australian waters. Have seen some
fair-sized shells on the Barrier off Magnetic and the
Palm Isles. The largest tridacna I have seen is the
half-shell of one very long out of water, on the
beach of Übantoketo islet in Butaritari Lagoon.
Having my boat anchor caught under a huge mush-
room-shaped coral growth during a blow and on a
rising tide, I had to slip, and, until recovering my
anchor, I used half of said tridacna for anchoring
the boat. Two powerful natives just managed to
tip it and stagger a few feet at a
time; hence the weight would be,
say, 4cwt., giving, roughly, Bcwt.
for the whole shell without the
fish. I do not think it is generally
known that this giant clam is
cultivated as a food. Within the
western reef —submerged on high
tides—of Butaritari Lagoon, in
suitable places, are “gardens” of
tridacna, the native te kima,
“planted” in regular rows. When
gathering, a native dives down,
and with a 16in. butcher’s knife
slashes between the teeth, before
the shell closes, and severs the
muscle working the hinge in the
shell. Nice judgment is required ;
cases are known where the opera-
tor miscalculated, and the shell
closed on his wrist. I have let
the lips close on the blade of a
canoe paddle, and the end of the
blade is in that tridacna yet for
aught I know. It is no infrequent
occurrence for a native, food-
hunting on .the edge of the reef,
to step into an open tridacna.
The foot is invariably lost.
“Flam” : Re blacks’ bees-nesting (B.
16/1/T3). No blackfellow in my kid days (over 40
years ago), in New England (N.S.W.), ever wasted
time cutting a tree down to get a bees’ nest. Jacky
climbed to the region of the sugar bag and cut it
out, dropping the comb on to a sheet of bark held
by Mary below. The bees didn’t trouble them any.
I may mention the honey took some straining.
IN PLAIN AUSTRALIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun had gone and the rain was near ;
A steamer smoked at the quay ;
From the forest I could hear
The sullen break of the sea.
The hush of Nature was most profound
On that sea-girt wooded hill,
Till raindrops splashed on the crackling ground
Like tears on a parchment will.
Then tea-things rattled inside a tent
Set down in that silence vast,
And clear, crisp speech with the rain-tune went,
“Well, it, it’s come at last!”
And someone yawned in a hungry way
“By , I b’lieve you’re right!
It looked like rain orl th’ day.
Hope ter it rains orl night!”
A third voice spoke as the black skies swilled
Their treasure on leaf and bough,
And the bracken slopes with laughter rilled:
“By , it’s coinin’ now ! ”
“Well, , it’s time,” sighed the first man then,
(“ ’Ey ! Hear them frogs !)
Don’t like this camp-lurk when
It rains cats an’ dogs.”
Then someone shouted above the roar
That dazed like a passing train,
“ ’Ey ( —■ — ) it’s swamped th’ floor !
It’s a cow, this rain!”

MISSING RELATIVES.
BLACK LIZZIE: “ You bin down Sydney, eh?
You bin hear tell Black M'ria? She bin
like mine sister, eh?”
“Settled”: I would advise “Searchlight”
(B. 9/l/’l3) to have a look at the pine in the
Atherton scrub (Q.) before he goes nap on the Dor-
rigo (N.S.W.) sticks. I can see one from where I
am writing whose girth measurement is 27ft. Bin. ;
it will cut 29,000 ft. of the best pine in Australia.
There is another within half a mile estimated at
37,000 ft. ; its waist measurement is 34ft. Yet, mostly
on account of ruinous coastal freights, the bulk
of this splendid wood is going up in smoke. I know
one selection of 150 acres on which no less than
3,000,000 ft. of marketable timber has been fired.
The Jap can send timber from Tokio to Sydney Har-
bor for 2s. 6d. per 100, whereas the freight from
Cairns to Sydney is about 7s. a hundred.
SUBJUGATED.
NERVOUS B USHWOMAN: "My good-
ness! A wild black!!”
"Oh, no, missus! He berry tame.

“Platman”: The boomerang, nulla and yel-
laman (the shield of the Central District aborigines)
are apparently unknown in Cape York Peninsula. I
made a collection of native weapons and curios dur-
ing a trip through the peninsula last year, but could
get only spears, woomeras, fire-sticks and dilly-bags.
The spears vary. There is the light, single-pointed
spear, for wallaby, plain turkey and kangaroo; the
heavy, wooden man-spear, single-pointed; and the
three- and four-pronged fish spears. In rare instances
the first two have the barbs cut out of the wood, but
most frequently they are nowadays tipped with 6in.
or Sin. of telegraph or fencing wire, bound so as
to form a barb. On the coast, old-time spears are
tipped with stingray tails. They, also, are becoming
scarce. The man-spear mentioned above is fashioned
from a single length of heavy wood, while the light
spears are generally the pole of the grass-tree, with
a hardwood point spliced on. Stone axes (also rare)
were once used, but have given place to the toma-
hawk, supplied by the Government. To ascertain
whether the niggers knew the boomerang, I cut a
model of one out of a piece of bark. Neither my
boy, nor others, to whom I showed it, knew anything
about the weapon.
* * * *
“Silas Snell”: The Morrison brothers, Tim
and Mick, had been pretty good friends up to the
time of the death of their venerable father. Then
the trouble began. The chief bone of contention was
a gold watch, valued at 40 guineas, which old
Morrison was known to have owned, and which Tom
believed Mick had taken over surreptitiously. Mick
acted as if he were convinced that Tom had boned
the heirloom, and was only formulating the accusa-
tion to save his face. There was another grievance.
In the division of the property of the lamented
Morrison one pair of brown trousers was not ac-
counted for. Tim insisted that his elder brother had
assumed illegal possession of the pants along with
the watch, and the absent garments remained a
sore subject for 18 years. The lads divided the old
man’s land at Cobblers with scrupulous exactness.
Tim took one half and Mick the other. For 18 years
they lived within a stone’s throw and never ex-
changed a word. They married and had children,
and the families inherited the paternal prejudices.
Mick and Tim had lawsuits over cows, and fences,
and water rights. Often Tim sued Mick for trespass,
and once Mick had a case against Tim for illegally
entering, when Tim, taking advantage of Mick’s
absence in Melbourne, searched his house in quest
of the gold watch and the dun-colored bags of their
deceased parent. Tim spread ill reports of Mick,
and Mick missed no opportunity of abqsing Tim’s
fair fame, and the burden of the bitter complaint
was always the pinched gold watch and the abducted
brown pants. Then Mick died rather suddenly, and
the grave of his father was opened to accommodate
his remains. Tim attended the funeral, but sourly
and “without prejudice,” so to speak. He did not
wish Mrs. Mick or any of the younger Micks to as-
sume that his presence implied any abandonment of
his claim or the smallest let-up in his grievance
with regard to the missing family jewels. When
preparations were being made to dispose of Mick, a
clumsy gravedigger put his foot through the lid of
old Morrison’s coffin, and the mystery of the gold
watch was elucidated at last. It lay on the breast
of Tim’s dead father, where Tim’s mother, a semi-
demented creature still living in the bosom of Mick’s
family, had slyly placed it. The watch and chain
were passed up to Tim. Tim handled them in silence
for a moment, his face as hard as bricks, and half
the population of Cobblers looked on, breathless.
Tim spoke at length, dangling the watch. “That’s
all very well,” said he, “but I’ll take me solemn
oat Mishter Mick had thim brown pants.”
“Gouger” : Just before the close of the
rainy season in Northern Queensland, among other
pests, comes in countless creeping millions the “Grey
Devil,” a long-haired caterpillar, who travels the
country in numerous closely-packed battalions. No
matter where the leader goes the rest follow without
the slightest variation. They walk right through a
tent, eat holes in the flour-bag, bog through blankets
—in fact, go through everything in their way bar
the axe. If a man wants to save anything (in ad-
dition to the axe) he has to shift his property out of
the line of march. At least, that was my experience
till I met the Old Hand away up on the Normanby.
Watched him handle one invasion as if he were a
traffic constable in George-street. Plucking a twig,
he laid it on the neck of the drum-major in front of
the army, and gently led him away past the camp.
The others followed like tame elephants drilling for
a Durbar.
A QUESTION OF CROP.
THE M ISSIONARY: “ We are thinking of planting the Cause in this district. Can we
rely on your help?”
C OCKY: “ Well, I dunno. I allus find paspalum holds ergin the drought best.”
“P.A.Q.”: “San Dido” (B. 9/1/T3) need
trouble no longer about enticing his “mountain
devil,” or to give him his correct moniker, Moloch,
to migrate to the Eastern States, as he is there
already. At least I can vouch for his being in South
Aus. I have seen him in many parts of the far
north of that State, and as near Adelaide as the
Mount Lofty ranges. Had “San D.” chained his
captive near an ants’ residence, he’d have seen him
eat all right. No “mountain devil” can keep up a
hunger strike with a breakfast of 2000 or so ants on
offer. *
Mike McGee, a meat-works employee, was
discovered by his mate endeavoring to recover his
coat, which had fallen into a vat of fertiliser
“Gawstruth,” said the mate, “you ain't goin’ ter
wear that coat after it bein’ in there?” “No er
course I ain’t,” burst forth Michael. “I don’t want
the flamin’ coat, but me lunch is in the pocket.”
» * * *
“Sliprail”: Re “K. O. Gill’s” par (B.
16/1/’l3) on barb wire. If the stock crippled
through getting entangled in plain-wire fences could
be mobbed up they would make a very fair showing
against the barb-wire victims. Horses suffering
from “spring itch,” greasy heels, etc., seem to fancy
wire fences are erected for their special use and
benefit, and they rub and scratch until they become
entangled or break the fence down. Then the male
members of the cow family have the same peculiarity
as man —a natural tendency to roam. Only they
forget to return. Barb wire proves a splendid check
to their migratory habits. Previous to the intro-
duction of the article this writer spent many a score
of Sundays searching after lost stock—days that
could have been more profitably spent in prayer and
meditation, or discussing politics with a neighbor’s
daughter. The Mallee farmer, making a start on a
little, simply runs a barb-wire from tree to tree
around his selection, and is ready to commence clear-
ing and cropping; and subsequently he loses no pre-
cious time searching for stray horses or bullocks.
Farmers there may be who know not the difference in
price between barb or plain wire. There may also
be farmers who do not know the difference between
a horse and a cow. But I would as soon search tor
the latter as the former. Considering that barb,
strained tight, will remain so at least 10 years,
whereas plain fences containing stock will remain
tight at most IS days, f say the writer-chap who
barracks for plain is the fool. Ferhaps he got bio
city pants torn in climbing through a barb-wire
fence during his Christmas holidays; hence his
failure to understand the popularity of the article.
But for my own part, if ever I meet the man who
invented barb wire, I am going to shout for him, and
I think I’m just as averse to ill-treating stock as
the next man.

“Yannatherra”: The cocky’s most useful
friend, after fencing wire, is his dog. Murphy has
three of the best. I watched them at a recent stock
sale, expectantly listening to the auctioneer. “Eight
bob, I’m bid! Eight! ’Gainst you, Mister Mur-
phy ! ” The dogs looked appealingly at the old man.
“Eight an’ six! Eight half! All done eight half!
Going eight half! Going! Goin’! Mr. Murphy!
Three hundred eight half!” Pleased yaps from the
dogs. After the sale, Murphy opened the drafting
gates for his intelligent employees, and went pub-
wards. “Bill” did the droving, and “Counter” and
“Scratch” waited at the gate. At each 100 “Coun-
ter” barked, at which “Scratch” made a paw mark
on the ground. Murphy returned with the beer in-
side and the froth on his whiskers, counted the
marks on the ground, got the mob on the road, and
returned for more beer.
“The Wanderer” : Three sets of twins had
to be registered lately in the Cow Country. The
name of the first was given as Peter, and the official
wit suggested that the second should be saddled
with Re-peater. When the second “double” happened
along, the first bairn was christened Kate —and
again the official wit rose to the occasion and sug-
gested that the second should be Dupli-cate. Then
came the third pair, the first of which was called
Max. The man behind the official pen came out on
top again with a suggestion that the second mite be
known through life as Cli-max.
TWO ACRES OF FLAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the St. Kilda brigade arrived, seven or eight
minutes after the alarm had been given, the flames
covered two acres, and were in imminent danger of
spreading to the wooden houses adjacent. —Report of
latest Melbourne suburban timber yard fire, the third
within six months.
I am a most religious man ;
But I would have you know
My days of holiness began
One sizzling week ago.
For years I’ve heard the parsons rave ;
It only roused my ire
Whene'er they called on me to save
My soul from endless fire.
I could not see, I could not smell,
The Devil’s furnace hot;
The ever-blazing, crackling Hell
I thought archaic rot.
But just a week ago I shared
A cottage evil-starred;
Its blinking little windows stared
Across a timber yard.
Great stacks of Oregon and pine
In baking silence lay,
And we could hear the ring and whine
Of whirling saws all day.
And when the long day’s work was done,
We thought it very good
To watch the red-hot setting sun
And smell the fresh-cut wood.
’Twas better far, so said my wife,
To have the timber there,
Than rows of houses filled with strife
And cats with tousled hair.
I thought so, too, until the night
I heard the fire-whips crack,
And saw two acres well alight.
Upon each tow’ring stack
Red devils danced in robes of smoke
And waved their yellow arms;
The neighbors with wild shouts awoke
And ran to give alarms.
Then furniture rolled here and there,
Or trundled off pell-mell,
While crowds of strangers flocked to stare
At firemen fighting Hell.
’Twas water that the hoses shot
To quench the devils’ lust;
But round that Hades bright and hot
It looked like silver dust.
It soared like drifting thistle floss,
Each tiny, futile jet.
“Oh, well,” remarked a helmet boss,
“It keeps the roadway wet!”
When all the wood was done, it died
Like some unholy dream ;
And outraged Night made haste to hide
The reeking field of steam.
As I limped back, I saw my star
O’er my scorched hut of wood.
Why move the timber yards? They are
An influence for Good.

THE PRIMARY PRODUCER.
There was never vet in the history of nations, one single country which grew great on the exportation of primary products. It is a sort of national indignity to send
Australian wool To Germany and get it back again in the piece or in the garment. It argues poverty of resource and a dependence such'as no nation should have upon anothei.
The humble and lowly figure on the right represents Australia’s native-born ; that on the left is the agent of the Foreign-trader. The whole represents
the importing party’s ideal of Australia’s trade and commerce.

FRANK DUFFY, newly-appointed Federal
High Court Judge.
The senior parson in active service in S.
Aus. is now Rabbi Boas, who has had charge
of the Adelaide Synagogue for 4.5 years.
Premier Peake (S.A.), who leaves for
England this month, was born in the Cold
Country; but Speaker Larry O’Loughlin.
who accompanies him, has never yet been
out of Australia. Peake was onlv a three-
year-old when he and his first set of teeth
landed in Melbourne, and he has been just
over half a century in the Commonwealth.
One of the Ma State’s most versatile pub-
lie servants, H. C. L. Anderson, who has
stepped through an avenue of comfortable
jobs from the Public Library to the Under-
Secretaryship of Agriculture, is going on
leave prior to retirement under the age-limit
regulation. He will take his recreation, etc.,
by toiling in the Public Service of South
Australia. In other words, he will leave off
labor and begin to carry bricks.
The Australian Government has ap-
pointed C. _ P. Schrader, M.A., a N. S.
wales public-school teacher, to the position
ot inspector of schools and director of
secondary education, in the Northern Terri-
tory at a salary of £SOO a year. There are
piactically only two schools on Australia’s
doorstep—one at Darwin and the other at
Pine Greek —with perhaps 150 scholars be-
tween them; so Schrader’s work will be a
gieat burden to him. Still the appointment
seems to be well in accord with the Gov-
ernment s policy. of populating the country
by flooding it with civil servants.
T r h . e u Well ' meaniu S Push the button, and
the Hebrews do the rest.” That has been
the consistent policy of the present N.S.W.
-Ministry, and a "lance at the Premier’s ex-
poundment of his programme for next ses-
sion shows that his faith in the button and
the Hebrew has in no way abated. In the
single item of public health he proposes
enough commendable but expensive things to
break the back of a much less exhausted
.treasury. And already his expenditure is
like the.horse that wins the Melbourne Cup.
while his revenue is the lame animal that
walks in with the crowd.
A Melbourne Argus correspondent re-
cently rushed an alarmed and hysterical
screed into, its columns about flags‘and the
blessed Union Jack. He had pervaded the
city on Foundation Day, and had noticed
hundreds of flagpoles, but very few flags.
The Stars and Strines were visible, and the’
German eagles, doubtless to do formal honor
to the occasion, but the Union Jack was
scarce almost invisible. The State Savings
Bank hoisted one, appropriately enough, up-
side down, and a couple more were nearly
half-mast, and that was about all. This
reverence for a piece of colored calico is
(hai acteristic of Jingoism and the Manches-
ter school, and is truly touching; but the
hapless correspondent need not weep over it.
The Australian flag, which displays enough
L nion Jack to meet all possible require-
inents, was flying bravely from the Common-
wealth offices in Spring-street. A lament of
absent guns might offer a better theme to a
patriotic pen than a w T ail over incorrect
rags.
Dour but big-hearted Dr. J. T. Harvey
the Barrier silverfield’s oldest medicine man!
who died at broken Hill last Saturday, had
a mortal dread of germs. When he reverted
to an old habit of the roaring boomtime he
wouldn’t let the barmaid change his glass.
It was quite bad enqugh, he said, to drink
out of one hotel glass, so he filled the same
one up again—and again. He married a
Miss Quintrell, a member of a once well-
known family of entertainers. A younger
brother was (or is) one of J.C.W.’s orches-
tra conductors.
Justice Higgins will be right glad to see
11s old friend Frank Duffy sitting beside
him on..the High Court Bench. In the
middle ’7o’s thev carried their legal swags
together as they chased the evasive guinea on
the Gippsland county court circuit, and a
few years later they did platform work for
John Redmond, who was then begging Aus-
tralian assistance for the struggling Land
League. For two young barristers who de-
pended upon the Tory solicitors for a crust
it was a plucky thing to help a cause which
was then so unpopular that many public
halls, and most private ones, were closed
against its advocacy.
James Styles, who formerly sat in the
Vic. Assembly as member for Williamstown,
and afterwards was a Senator, died a few
days ago, at St. James’s Park, Hawthorn,
the old home of George Coppin. Stvles’s
father was associated with Thomas Brassey
in railway contracting in England : and when
Styles, jun., was a very small boy, the family
came to Australia, and father and son
wrnrked at the old job of road and railway
making. In IS7I. after a spell in Queens-
land. they returned to Victoria, and the firm
of Styles, Murray and Cos. was formed.
Later, James took on railway work for the
S. Aus. Government, and built the line from
Burra to Hallett by day labor—the first
occasion on which the system was used on
a big railway job in Australia. That was in
1877-8. He got into politics via the Wil-
liamstown Town Council.
Harold N. Sloman. the new imported
headmaster of Sidney Grammar School, has

Eton and Harrow and Rugbv. it can’t he

furnishes a list of nearly 900 schools in Eng-
land and Wales, and includes' Radley Col-
lege among them without any comment on
its special excellence. Possibly Harold N.
Sloman has other qualifications besides being
young, inexperienced, the possessor of a
very moderate degree, and imported. In
that case they will doubtless ar»near as time

George Plaistowe Unwin, aged 71. He was
a Sydney native, the son of F. W. Unwin, a
solicitor who practised over 80 years ago in
partnership with the original Randolph J.
Want. Father Unwin was interested in
sugar, too, and spent a fortune in the first
refinery works in Australia. Unwin, jun.,

“Pink Tape”: C. J. Saunders, one of
Ala’s Public Service Commissioners, quietly
retires with no more noise than a Gazette
notice makes. He was granted leave of ab-
sence last year, a sick man, and he left for
England seeking health. As his retirement
wasn’t then hinted at, he has evidently not
found what he was looking for. Saunders
was not a popular Commissioner, but he
was undoubtedly an able one. His value to
the Government and the taxpayer lay in the
fact that he could say “No.” Anyone can be
a popular P.S.B. man by granting everv one
an increase. Many have tried to be so by
holding out hope to the applicant in the
Board-room, and snatching it away in the
Gazette. Mostly because he scorned such
tricks, the Service used to say that Saunders
had neither heart_ nor bow r els of compassion.
Still, it wasn’t his money he didn’t spend ;
and the service may miss him yet.

no grandchildren.
One of the immigrants brought
out to S. Aus. by the Verran Gov-
ernment about two years ago has
since “nominated” 33 of his rela-
tives, and they are all now working
in the State. The heads of the
families are farm laborers, and many of the
sons and daughters are domestic helps and
farm hands. No immigration agent like the
successful immigrant!
Nielsen, the inconvenient supporter whom
the N.S.W. Government sent away to
America on full Parliamentary salary and
£4 a for “exnenses” (if it had been
called “wages” instead of “expenses,” Niel-
sen's seat and Parliamentary screw would
have been forfeited, and there would have
been a very awkward election), has been
defending himself. He has also been defend-
ing his “expenses.” He was, he declares, in
the habit of naying fl a day for his room at
an hotel, and he quotes 9s. as the price of a
single meal. If he did this sort of thing,
there was nothing nf Spartan simplicity
about Nielsen —in fact, he must have had a
blow-out worthy of Sardanapalus. And the
same old gloom enshrouds the value of the
job on which this magnineent nerson spent
so much of the public money, and so much of
the time the people paid him his Parlia-
mentary wage for.
THE RETURN.
In proposing the toast of the guests, Mr. Fisher
welcomed the Japanese, and expressed the hope that
this would not be their last visit. —Newt item.
“Banzai, Andy! Here we are again!"
The most cordially welcomed visitor to the
A.W.U. Conference in Sydney was Dave
Bowman, the Big Australian leader of the
Queensland Parliamentary Labor party; and
his appreciation of the welcome simply bub-
bled and sparkled. Kidston, when Premier,
got the House to put £2OO on the leader of
the Opposition, in addition to the ordinary
Parliamentary salary; and that aid stood to
David when his health broke down. Now he
his apparently quite recovered, and seems
full of action. Bowman is a native of Ben-
digo, and when not politically employed runs
a newsagent's shop near Brisbane. Kidston
made a crust in the same way at Rockhamp-
ton.
Charles Gavan Duffy was thrice married.
His first wife yielded John Gavan Duffy, by
trade an attorney, and Postmaster-General
in George Turner’s first Ministry. Xon-
W owser Tories think he ought to have been
a Senate candidate, instead of Mauger.
Charles Gavan’s second marriage yielded new
High Court Justice Frank Gavan and C. G.,
Clerk of the Commonwealth Parliament.
The third marriage yielded George Gavan
Duffy, a promising orator in Ireland. There
are other clever family sprigs, including
notable girls. The new Justice was born
February 29. 1552. So he only has a birth-
day. every four years, and even that was
denied him in 1900. He was rather slow in
getting forward at the Bar. but obtained the
County Court lead when Hood went forward
to the Supreme Court: and when Madden
became Chief Justice. Duffy took his place
in rivalry to Purves, and succeeded Purves
as leader of the Bar. He is a particularly
suave little man. universally liked, and with
a fine judicial temperament.
A LESSON IN MANNERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Premier's Manners. —Recently a deputation
from the Brighton Council waited on the Premier
Watt), and afterwards the Mayor complained
publicly of Mr. Watt’s manner of treating the depu-
tation. Mr. W att thereupon stated, through the press,
that the Brighton councillors apparently wanted feed-
ing-bottles, bibs and perambulators, rather than
straight business talk. — Argus, 3/2/’l3.
The business-man, he thumped the table, and bel-
lowed, “Oh, go to pot!
Why, I am a bizness man,” he said, “and surely I
know what’s what!”
And as he rolled up his sleeves, prepared for the long
day’s strenuous graft,
In a nasty, business-like sort of way he threw back
his head and laughed ;
And “Pshaw!” he muttered, and “Pish!” he sneered,
and he also remarked “Tut, tut!”
And the Voice of the People, staring into its cady,
murmured, “But”
“Shut up!” the business person roared, and banged
on the board some more,
And the Public gloomily breathed a sigh and gazed
on the shiny floor.
“Don’t dare interrupt me when I speak!” the man of
business said,
And, as he. uttered the sage advice, his dial was
wrathy red,
And his optics popped, and he looked, indeed, like
an adder about to strike,
When a fatuous citizen raised his voice and cackled,
“Well, I should like”
“Now, none o’ your lip!” the great man gruffed, and
he frowned at the forward one ;
“You’ll have your say,” he snarled, “but certainly
not till I have done!
Just shut your face for a while—l’ve had enough of
your foolish gab!”
And the interrupter was dead as nails, if a glance of
the eye could stab,
As the bizzer sat on his big chair-springs and smoked
at his courtly ease,
Till a temerarious soul spoke up, with a diffident “If
you please”
Then forthwith rose the business-man in his might
and his majesty,
And he opened the door in a courteous way, as it
might have been you or me,
And the gentle tones of his speech were those of a
man who is sworn to peace,
As he said, “The lot o’ you, out o’ this, or I’ll send
for the dashed police!”
And the argumentative bunch went forth, and they
wrangled upon the mat
In the usual way, and cursed somewhat, and won-
dered what they were at.

A cable message from London states that the Pall
Mall Gazette announces that the Prince of Wales,
now a student at Oxford University, is learning to

Aye, piping is a foolish trade,
And bagpipes sound like H—l;
But as the piper must be paid
You’re wise to play yoursel’,
Oh, aye!
You’re wise to play yoursel’.
But mostly kings for siller call,
And Cohen must look sharp ;
So, if ye’d any sense at all,

Ye’d twang the old Jew’s haro!

Naturally the directors don’t put it that way. They
show their reserves as £203,200 less than that ; and
the divs. work out at a paltry 40 p.c. according to
their reckoning. It is an amazing business altogether.
Thirty years ago and a bit less, in the days when
people who were alleged to be statesmen ruled in N. S.
Wales, a silverfield was discovered on the Barrier.
The country west of the Darling Was supposed to be
a desert, and the idea of linking it up with Sydney
wasn’t entertained. And the idea of making a short
Government line to the S. Aus. border, and thus
feeding another State’s railways, was even more pre-
posterous. Hence authority was given to this co. to
build the railway—on any old terms. The line was
only about 30 miles long, and had no engineering
difficulties; so all the capital that was put up was
£46,800, though another £16,000 was represented
by promoters’ shares. Members of Parliament were
not paid in those days—anyhow, not out of the State
Treasury. Not a penny more capital ever came out
of the shareholders’ pockets, though by a steady pro-
cess of watering, the capital (on paper) was brought
up to £250,000 in this ingenious fashion: —
1886. —Registered; paid capital, £46,800 plus
£16,000 in promoters’ shares at £5 each.
1888. —First stock watering; £41,860 capitalised
(two shares for every three).
1889. —The promoters’ £5 shares turned into five
ordinary £1 shares. Second stock watering,
£17,433 (one in six). Third stock watering,
£15,273 (one in eight).
1890. ‘Fourth stock watering, £27,473 (one in
five).
1891. —Fifth stock watering, £32.967 (one in five).
1910. —Sixth stock watering, £52,194 (one in four).
Capital and reserves combined amount to-day to
£431,939, made up as follows:
Capital supplied by shareholders .. £46,800
Profits capitalised . . .. - . 203.200
Profits remaining as reserves .. 181,939
Total funds .. .. .. . ; £431,939
Meantime huge dividends have been paid, and large
sums, spent on the reconstruction of the line, have
been charged to working expenses. At the outset
the whole thing was just as cheap as it could be;
to-day the line is fit to carry the heaviest traffic.
A trifle has been charged to capital, for appear-
ance’s sake ; the bulk has just gone down to main-
tenance account. At the end of 1910 the assets,
apart from the line and rolling stock and plant,
amounted to £156,175 after allowing for liabili-
ties. At the end of 1911 the figures had "-one up
to £186,949, though meantime £lOO,OOO had
been paid in divs. At the end of 1912, after pay-
ing another £lOO,OOO, the surplus (nearly all
liquid) was £212,352. Thus in two years, besides
paying £lOO,OOO p.a. in divs., large additions
have been made to rolling-stock, and the line has
been practically relaid, and £56,177 has been
added to the stores and liquid assets —on an actually
paid capital of £46,800.
As remarked above, the unpaid statesmen who ruled
N. S. Wales 25 years ago gave the promoters their
Bill on any old terms they liked to name. Cunningly
a provision was inserted for the purchase of the under-
taking—after 21 years. All that the State has to do
is to pay 21 times the annual average profit for the
preceding seven years. Thus, if the State likes to pay
£2,250,000 for this scrap of line now it may have it;
and if it provided 4 p.c. interest and an utterly in-
sufficient 1 p.c. for a sinking fund, it would still have
to charge rates so excessive as to bring in £llO,OOO
a year over and above working exes. There have been
times in the past, and there certainly will be times
again, when £llO,OOO would be a preposterous figure.
Just at present Broken Hill is reeking with money;
the 30,000-odd people there are producing more wealth
perhaps than any other community of 30,000 people
in the world. But that is (1) because of the boom
in metals, and (2) because the heaps of rich zinc
residues, accumulated during years, are now being
fast chewed up by new processes. When the metal
boom peters out and the last of the dumps are cleaned
away, things will be very different. In the sick days
of 1.902-3 this co. got down to an annual £60,000
and lower. And the time will of course come when
it will get down lower than that; for the mines can’t
last for ever. One can see 14 or 15 years ahead for
the best of them ; but what is beyond that nobody
knows, and even the 14 or 15 years’ life depends on
the metal markets. For the rest this co.’s risk lies
in the completion of the State line from Condobolin
to the S. Aus. border at Cockburn, already authorised
by Parliament. But whether that line will get much
of the ore traffic is another matter; in that connec-
tion it may be of some importance to remember that
the men who have the biggest say on the mines’
Boards are the most interested also in the Tramway

This is one of the things with which ‘.‘Bob” Philp
recovered his affluence. It was in a bad way a few
years back, and for a long while the 15s. shares were
worth only about 10s. (There are 218,323 shares of
£1 each, 109,044 of them paid to 15s. —the other
ss. being callable only on winding up—and the rest
fully paid.) In its earlier days it devoted itself ex-
clusively to meat-packing and freezing; then, in the
bad times of 1903, the co. backed a change of seasons
and plunged in northern stations, putting £146,5X1
into these properties at one pop. As the co. got in
cheaply, and has had a run of very good seasons,
with stock prices high throughout, it ought to have
done splendidly. There was a big mortgage on the
places when they were bought; the 1903 accounts
showed secured creditors 1 for £142,964, besides
ordinary trade debts; but some of this money may
have been raised to finance the packing business, a
very heavy stock of unsold products being held at
the time. The unknown quantity in the problem is
the amount written off properties and the value put
on live stock. A few years ago, as some people will
very well remember, Goldsbrough, Mort and Co.
found themselves able to write a good many tens of
thousands on to the book value of station property (in-
cluding stock) ; and the same uncertainty always
exists in connection with this class of assets. With
its double-barrelled business the co.’s figures will
probably be less erratic in the future than they have
been in the past. When the co. wasn’t a stock-raiser
itself, high prices frequently shut up the works;
now. if the works are shut up for that reason, the
co. has a very good chance to score by supplying its
own stook to the local market at prices too high to
allow of a successful export trade. It is still pos-
sible, of course, that a drought might close the works
and knock out the stations simultaneously; but
droughts are scarce cattle in the North. On the
figures contained in the table the lay-by during the
past few years has been poor, and that adds im-
portance to the point whether sufficient has been
written off the properties to cover depreciation, etc.
The thing ought to be good ; liabilities are nowadays
comparatively small (debts are £89,664, while un-
sold products and other assets apart from stations
and works are valued at £107,275) ; and it looks
as though meat-growers are in for good .prices for
some years, at least. But it is another of the cases
in which practically everything—profits included—
depends on the valuation of assets; and as to that
matter no check is possible. One has to take the
figures supplied by the management and swallow
them blindly, or put them on the side of his plate
and go hungry.

The published accounts don’t put it that way. They
allege that the net profit, “after providing for re-
serves and all costs and charges,” was £10,626. The
Bulletin, however, figures it out like this: —
Added to Public Risk Reserve . . . . £2,000
Added to Workmen’s Insurance Fund . . 678
Added to Steamers’ Insurance Fund .. 1,403
Added to Reserve Fund .. .. . . 9,000
Alleged net profit .. .. .. .. 10,626
£23,707
Less taken from Employers’ Liability Fund.. 2
Total (profit as per table) . . . . £23,705
Some of the additions to reserves are probably not
true profits ; they are premiums paid into a fund to
cover a risk which is still current. Thus, £lOO,OOO
or more might conceivably be some day required to
meet claims arising out of a bad accident due to the
fault of an employee. Giving all that in, however,
the results are gaudy—gaudier even than the table
suggests, because an unknown amount of profit has
been written off ostensibly against depreciation. The
size of that writing-off can be dimly recognised by
going back a few years. The capital now is £158,409.
Six years ago it was £25,000. No new capital has
been actually paid by the. shareholders since then,
though £8670 of debenture debt was converted into
£4335 of share capital. Including the debenture
debt among the liabilities, the latter exceeded the
assets other than steamers in 1906 by £6848. The
assets other than steamers now exceed the liabilities
by £75,443. So in six years, without calling on
shareholders for a penny, (1) all the numerous ad-
ditions to the co.’s fine fleet have been made, and (2)
£82,291 has been added to the landed property, etc.,
and liquid assets. What amount has been put into
new steamers this paper doesn’t know, but the three
principal additions have cost probably somewhere
about £75,000. (The December, 1908, balance-sheet
showed that £23,135 had then been paid on account
of the Burra-Bra.) Meantime, a dividend averaging
about 12 p.c. has been paid, not merely on the
original £25,000, but on the repeatedly watered cap-
ital. Taking the capital provided by shareholders as
£33,670 (the original £25,000 plus the debenture
money), the present dividend is at the rate of about
63 p.c. p.a. And the thing isn’t going to stop there.
The authorised capital is £250,000 in £1 shares. So
far only 211,212 shares have been issued, paid to 15s.
Further waterings are in prospect; and there is no
doubt the profits can very easily stand the strain of
a bigger dividend. Where it is going to stop this
paper doesn’t know. A harbor disaster might, besides
costing a pot of money, put the Manly excursion
business out of favor for a while; but that is the
only risk showing on the horizon, though a slump in
Sydney’s prosperity would, no doubt, cause a serious
shrinkage in the amount of money available for pic-
nicking' and amusements. There is, of course, also the
possibility of nationalisation ; but it isn’t often men-
tioned in connection with this particular service.

But in addition to that dividend, a bonus of £1 per
share (=£200,000) has lately been declared, a call
of the same amount being made simultaneously.
The co. is in 200,000 shares of £5 each paid hither-
to only to 10s. ; the call—practically a transfer of
reserves to capital—makes the shares 30s. paid and
leaves them liable for another £3 10s. The paid
capital is thus trebled. The capitalisation is a very
good thing from the shareholders’ point of view; for
apart from the fact that the liability on the shares
is reduced, a 374 p.c. div. was liable to attract the
hostile notice of the insuring public. With £200,000
transferred from reserves to capital, the shareholders
will be just as well off with a dividend of 12$ p.c. ;
and that won’t hit the man who supplies the” profit
quite so hard in the eye. The co. was formed in „
1872, and its history proves over again that, once
a fire-insurance business gets through its teething,
there are few better money-spinners. The disappear-
ances during teething are, however, rather tremen-
dous. Some drop out altogether; the majority make
some sort of compromise with Death by selling
themselves to an opposition house. After 40 years
this co. is in the beautiful position of having so
much acccumulated funds that its interest earnings
alone are equal to over 36 p.c. on its paid capital
( £100,000). And, as the table shows, part of that
capital was provided out of reserved profits seven
years ago. Of the assets which produce this cheerful
result £259,369 is in office premises and other prop-
erties, £240,976 is on mortgage, and the balance
of the gross assets ( £313,195) is in public securi-
ties and other liquid assets. The co.’s risks are
spread practically all over the world, and no disaster
short of the kind that can only be dreamed on
a lobster supper could call for more quick money
than is represented by the liquid assets. If the co.
were smaller and its risks less spread, the proportion
of tied-up money would certainly be too great.
Next let us dig into the insurance business of the
co.:—

The expense rate is low and the loss rate compara-
eively high, the natural consequences of doing (1) a
big marine business; (2) a considerable amount of
reinsuring for other cos. The premiums for the year,
as shown above, were £376,665. After paying out
the dividend for the last half-year, the shareholders’
funds were £703.295, or 187 p.c. of the vear’s pre-
miums. This indicates a stronger position than that
of the. average of the leading British cos. ; their
figure is about 162 p.c. From this and every point
of view, indeed, the co.’s standing is excellent.

That is very fine. The co. has been scoring all ways.
Trustee cos. derive most of their revenue from two
lots of commissions—(l) from the income of trust
estates, on which from 2i p.c. to 5 p.c. is charged ;
and (2) from a commission of from 1 to 2£ p.c. on
the capital value of those estates. An improvement
in the interest earnings of an estate thus means a
bigger income for the trustee; and the same result
follows from a boom in propertv values. Take an
estate worth £25,000 six- years ago: the chances
are that/it would be now worth 20 p.c. more, or.
£30,000. That extra £5OOO would add £125 to
the trustee’s single commission on the corpus or
capital value; and the extra interest earnings would
probably mean another £2O or so a year from that
estate. The whole average annual cost to an estate
varies with the number of years the estate
is in hand. For instance, take an estate of
£20,000 bringing in 5 p.c. as an average. The
corpus comipission would be £5OO. The annual
commission would be £25. If the trust was ”om-
pleted in 10 years—that is to say, if the final dis-
tribution of the estgte took place in that time —the
average annual charge would thus be £75, or 3J
p.c. If it took 20 years, the average would be
£5O p.a., or 2i p.c. on the capital value. Com-
paratively few estates can be wound up in 10 years
or anything like it. Trustee cos. adopt different methods
with regard to the lump corpus commission mentioned
above. This one’s good policy is to reserve portion
of it, and draw upon the reserve as the work of ad;,
ministration proceeds. In the past year the division'
has been as follows:
Profit as stated by the co. .. .. ..£11,706
Added to Commissions Reserved account.. 2,638 i
Total profit .. .. .. ..£14,344
The paid capital is £50,000 in 100,000 shares of
£lO each, paid to 10s. The liability is thus very
solid. The risks, however, are not tremendous. The
co. is certainly responsible in the event of any
officer monkeying with trust funds, or if the instruc-
tions of a will are not carried out and the benefici-
aries lose thereby; but with experienced men in
charge, such accidents are very rare. And the co.
doesn’t risk anybody else’s money in speculations or
investments on its own account; while as for its own
money, the bulk is in mortgages (supposed to
be of the gilt-edged variety) and bank and Treasury
deposits. There are very few investments indeed
which show so big a return with so little risk of
principal; and there are not many businesses which
seem surer of growing. This, of course, applies to
trustee cos. in general, and not to this or any one
in particular. The list which follows shows how the
total value of estates in hand has bounded along:—
1895 £2,424,413
1900 3.928,520
1905 5,758,223
1910 8,175,990
1911 .. .. .. 8,853,862
' 1912 9,791,590
And though the State may take a hand, and though
competition may either whittle down the charges or
require the cos. to do more for the same money, the
undoubted tendency is for the business to grow. The
day of the private trustee is over—the trustee who
was liable to be either dead or in Guam when he was
wanted, and frequently, being inexperienced at the
job, wasn’t of much use even when he was alive and
on the spot.

This co. was formed in 1889 with a capital of
£60,000, of which £57,500 was represented by
nothing more substantial than goodwill—the right,
that is, to keep two names over the doorway. The
owners of those names have long since disappeared
and for many years past the two Greggs, the manag-
ing directors, have been the king-pins of the busi-
ness. What will happen when they disappear nobody
knows —some guess this, and some guess that There
may be other king-pins to be had; but therein lies
the gamble. Meantime there isn’t a great deal
the old paper asset left, extraordinary progress h °
ing been made in getting rid of it during the mi
few years of booming property values, with th
natural corollary of sweet valuation fees and tooth
some selling commissions. This shows the raniriit
of the movement: — rnuity

Liabilities .. 9,298 44,152 17*034
Surplus .. £17,923 £22,157 ~£5(b339
Liquid assets here include advances on property
which now amount to £23,733. The liabilities are
chiefly deposits on sales —amounts due to vendors
From this it will be seen that though the co takes
a little risk, it is not in the subdivision business on
its own account, and does, so far as can be seen
no trading at all. Assuming the assets are worth
20s. in the £ (and they ought to be), the surplus
of the liquid assets referred to above amounts to
16s. Bd. per share; and it will take less than two
years at the recent rate of going to make it 20s
After that, though a substantial reserve for equalisa-
tion of dividend purposes will be handy, the direc-
tors will probably see no good reason to lay by so
large a proportion of the profits as they have done
during the past five years. True, profits are very
likely to ease off so much when the recent feverish
activity in the property, market ends that 90 p c
of the earnings then may amount to no more than
50 p.c. does now.

A deficit of £27,182 is pretty serious; but the
figures are a heap better than they were before ex-
Premier Wilson was driven to put things on a
better footing three years ago. Bigjohn Forrest was
the father of the scheme; and The Bulletin will
always count it to him for righteousness that he pro-
vided for a sinking fund to pay back capital inside
25 years. Unfortunately the mostly-absentee mining
cos., led by men who are always talking about driv-
ing capital out of the country, clamored for and got
such a reduction in rates that for a good while the
scheme did not pay interest, let alone the sinking
fund which the foreign capitalist had been led to ex-
pect. True, the sinking fund contributions were
paid over to the trustees; but the money came
either out of the general taxpayers’ pocket, or, in-
directly, out of other loans. This was particularly
scandalous in view of the phenomenal profits which
the mining cos. were then making. Moreover, the
scheme had been carried out to oblige the mines,
and as it was clear that the mines could not last
very many years, it was monstrous to relieve them
while they were most affluent, seeing that it would
be almost impossible to recover the lost ground later
on. The next table shows the amount of interest
and sinking fund required:—

1911 . . 102,952 89,359 192,311
1912 .. 104,118 88,345 192,463'
Since 1904 (inclusive), when the scheme got regu-
larly to work, the sinking fund contributions should
have amounted to £769.001 ; the amount actually
available is a mere £156,091. In other words, the
largelv-absentee people for whom this scheme was
provided have supplied £156,091 towards the sink-
ing fund ; the general taxpayer has had to part up
£612,910. Yet the absentee talks of being unfairly
treated!
The capital originally put into the undertaking
was £2,866,454. The State borrowed that, and is
directly responsible for repayment. The supple-
mentary expenditure, for which the Water Supply
Board is primarily responsible, amounts to
£450,990. The whole position is shown here-
under :

Sinking fund .. 1,003,995 60,555

It was a fine scheme, only spoiled by weak adminis-
tration. The most cheerful feature is that, though
the Board can’t now collect the money which ought
to have been paid in the old fat vears, the greater
part of the sinking fund is now coming from the
people who ought to provide the lot, but formerly
provided nothing.

Of the profit of £9308 shown as having been made-
in the past half-year £llBO came from the re-sale of
some Manly property. This leaves £Bl2B of profit
from ordinary trading. It is unquestionably a good'
profit—l 7 p.c. on the capital of £94,000. But people-
who want to see their principal safe will note that
there is still £21,346 represented by the intangible-
thing called goodwill, while £20,900 is represented/
by leaseholds and improvements thereon, and £38,170/
by furniture, crockery and other plant, etc.; and at
large quantity of second-hand crockery, etc., might:
fetch very little if it had to be sold. Apart from this:
question of the quality' of the assets, the perma-
nency of the business is also worth taking into*
account. It won’t be very hard for most people to-
remember eating-houses that were very popular 20>
years ago and have either disappeared altogether or
are scarcely heard of nowadays. In fact, many a
restaurant has been practically emptied in a month
bv a change of management. Goodwill in an eating-
shop business is therefore an uncertain asset: and,
though it may be safe enough to back one particular
man,'or two or three men, to succeed in the business,
it is quite unsafe to back a name after those men
have gone. So far, as before hinted at, everything
in the garden looks lovely. Presuming that enough
profit is written off to cover wear and tear, etc. —a most
important matter —the 17 p.c. of profit is excellent;
and though the dividend has been kept at a steady 10
p.c., most satisfactory progress has been made in re-
ducing the deficit. The whole thing for the investor
boils down to the risk he is prepared to take with his
capital in return for a high rate of dividend. At
present the capital, as shown above, is £94,000 in
£1 shares; and another 6000 are shortly to be issued
to provide for business extensions.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

Best Yorkshire Farnley Iron is preferred by engi-
neers, where toughness, great strength and close

This co. carries on business in another co.’s premises,
and has the right to go on doing it until 1930 —17
years from now. At the end of that time the land-
lord may tell it to quit; or it may be told that it
may stay if it likes to rebuild the premises and pay
twice as much rent for its own bricks and mortar as
it formerly paid for the landlord’s. The last time
the lease was about to-expire the co. had to under-
take to spend £5OOO on additions before it could
get a renewal. At present the co.’s more or less
liquid assets amount to only £905 in excess of lia-
bilities ; all its tangible possessions besides that
£905 are a few sticks of furniture. The capital
has been written down to £12,250 (7s. per share).
To make good the capital represented only by the.
paper item called goodwill, £4OO must be put aside
every year and invested at 4 p.c. If that isn’t
done, then the time will come when the co. will be
liable to find itself out on its ear, with nothing but
a few sticks to represent the capital. A 12| p.c.
div. looks fascinating, no doubt; but in view of
what has just been said it is clear that the co. must,
in addition, put up £2OO every half-year. A start
has been made with £500; and so long as the pay-
ments are kept up regularly and the fund credited
with its own earnings, well and good. A watchful
eye must be turned in that direction. The man who
merely looks at the dividend and disregards the other
matter forgets that principal is of some importance
as well as interest. # 4

This makes two trustee cos. in Bendigo ; but appar-
ently this one keeps its best eye open for a country
connection, and to that end has secured a Board with
a good punch behind it. It was significant, by the
way, that this Board, by resolution, increased its
number the other day so that it could make room
for old Dr. Atkinson’s barrister son —and old Dr.
Atkinson must by this time be one of the wealthiest
men in Victoria. The co. has a capital of £11,620,
in £1 shares paid to 10s. Practically the whole of
the money is in Government stock lodged with the
Treasury. Naturally it isn’t doing a great deal of
business yet; even the most enthusiastic well-wishers
of a trustee co. seem to have an objection to being
referred to as the deceased merely in order to give
the office a job. In the circumstances the co. has
done very well to wipe out all its preliminary exes,
with 24 years’ surplus revenue. With careful man-
agement and the usual strict attention to business
coupled with a stern resolve to keep down the bifl
for extras against every trust estate, the co. ought
to have a future with the gilt growing thicker and
thicker on it every year. Even if a trustee co. ad-
ministers an estate only just as well as a private
trustee, there are obvious advantages about employ-
ing the co., since its charges are fixed, and its con-
tinuance doesn’t depend on any one man s life. And
that’s apart altogether from the fact that a tnistee
co. puts up a guarantee with the Government that it
will run straight and do its work in accordance with
the living law and the dead man’s instructions.

Lionel Flight, “Amusement Kin?.’’ of
Melbourne, is the self-appointed governing-director of
an unformed co., Lionel Flight, Ltd., which proposes
to erect more picture theatres in Melbourne and
elsewhere.” The goodwill offered to the co., in con-
sideration of 10,000 paid-up shares, is an option on
one property and “negotiations” for the purchase of
another. The shareholders, having subscribed £40,000
for a like number of shares, will then proceed to
make money hand over fist, according to the prospec-
tus. The two proposed places of profit-making will
cost £36,000 to purchase, remodel and furnish.
Weekly expenses are estimated at £438, and tne
total weekly attendance at the two houses will be
62,000 people, whose average payment of 4d. a head
will yield £lO3O. Net weekly profit £585, or
thereabouts. Melbourne, it seems, is ready to in-
crease its output of picture-showgoers by three mil-
lion two hundred and twenty-four thousand per an-
num. Lionel Flight was misnamed. He should be
Fancy Flight. .
The prospectus of Lionel Flight, Ltd., contains a
bad feature, to which attention has already been
drawn in connection with other ventures—now mostly
dead. As mentioned above, the public is invited to
subscribe for 40,000 £1 shares; and the calcula-
tions in the prospectus are based on the before-quoted
expenditure of £36,000. Yet the promoters may go
to allotment when a paltry 2000 have been applied
for. This is just as though a syndicate issued a
prospectus dealing with the gaudy commercial- chances
of a swift train service from (say) Bourke to Boon-
gal, but reserved to itself the right to start drawing
directors’ fees as soon as it had got enough money to
buy a wheelbarrow. *
Cope’s Creek Central (N.S.W.) continues
to fatten a mostly-Melbourne crowd that was pretty
fat already. Like most of these tin-dredging cos., i
didn’t dip deep into anybody’s pocket, and its paid
capital even now is only £7500 (30,000 shares o
55.). Last half-year it paid its 25th, 26th, 27th and
28th divs., scattering £6OOO, and then it had £2829
available for depreciation, etc. There isn t much left
of the original property ; but it s the habit of the
managers of these tin cos., when things are running
smoothly, to poke around looking for new ground,
and the Cope’s Central is going nap on a big blocic
at Skeleton Creek, where a new plant is making ready
tor a trial run.
Cope’s Creek Central produced 100 tons tin
oxide m six months, and, as said just now, made
a profit of £8829, or at the rate of (roughly) £BB
per ton. Shares have been sold in Melbourne at 325.=
£48,000 for the whole 30,000. To get that back the-
co. requires to produce 600 tons of oxide at a profit
of £BO per ton, or, on this easing market, say, 1000 i
tons at a profit of £4B per ton—a big undertaking,,
considering that it has taken six months to produce-
-100 tons, and that, though immediate prospects are
good, tin areas are not plentiful.
Hill End (N.S.W.) is having a mixed
tine. The Golden Gully, Tambaroora, seems to have
missed the big things expected, and now, after a lot
of messing about through plant delays, washed-out
dams, etc., it proposes to depart and give Mudgee a
trial. The Amalgamated is not happy, and nasty
remarks are sometimes passed. The Reward, how-
ever, claims to have had better luck as a result
of opening up the Frenchmen’s Reef. Large re-
serves are talked about, and a big hit is to be
made when the Robert Emmett crosscourse is struck,,
a matter of another couple of hundred feet ahead..
A shy little virgin reef, hitherto unsuspected, has
been exposed to the west in the crosscut making-
for the Exhibition shaft. The latter is in-
the main hoisting shaft, and beyond it the co. has;
visions of picking up a whole lot of onee-wealthy
acquaintances in the Paxton’s Reef, Beyer’s and'
Holterman’s, the Star of Peace, Phillipson’s and other
lesser _ lights. The chief anxiety is whether these
haven’t sobered down to ordinary, plain reefs, without
the lovely garnishment that ancient mines have a.
habit of acquiring.

As to Great Cobar, Ltd., the thing in
which shareholders are most interested can be put
briefly this way:—
Dec., 1907 .. Profit £188,931 Div. 11l p.c.
„ 1908 .. Loss 501 ~ Nil
~ 1909 .. Profit 598 „ Nil
June, 1911 .. Profit 35,862 ~ Nil
„ 1912 .. Profit 125,129 „ Nil
But, alas! of that £125,129 nothing whatever is
available for shareholders; and things will have to
be a good deal better before anything is available.
Add to that £125,129 an amount of £74 brought
forward from the previous year; total, £125,203.
This hfis been cut up as follows: —
Depreciation of plant .. .. ..£47,686
Underwriting commission, written off.. 43,161
Balance forward .. .. .. .. 34,356
Total £125,203
The amount written off against depreciation looks
large, but is none too much: mining plant is soon,
scrapped nowadays. The amount written off com-
mission leaves £50,000 still to be provided on that
account. But so far as shareholders are concerned,
the most dismal feature is the £724,800 of out-
standing 6 p.c. debentures. These not only take a
first bite of over £40,000 a year for interest, but
under the Trust deed ordinary shares cannot draw
a penny of the profits of any year until debentures
to the face value of £lOO,OOO have been redeemed
at 105. On the other hand, it has to be kept in
mind that when £lOO,OOO of debentures are re-
deemed it won’t in that year be necessary to write
off anything else against depreciation; the amount
paid can be written off. Had the cash been actually
available, no doubt £lOO,OOO would have been
repaid this year; as it is, the writing off. is mostly
book-keeping. The share capital of the co. is
£932,170. To pay even a 6 p.c. div. the co. must
therefore make a profit of (say) £150,000 —-until,
that is, the £724.800 of debentures are got rid of.
A 10 p.c. div. will call for a profit of £200,000.
And of that dividend, of course, a considerable part
would have to be regarded as return of capital. In
the past year the profit was £125,000. Standard
copper averaged a very good £62 for the year to
the end of June. The output was 6763 tons of
blister copper. An extra £8 per ton for copper
would mean £54,000 more profit on that output.
At £6O the profit would be about £llO,OOO. The
output may no doubt be increased, and the flotation
process may be of great assistance in the metallur-
gical department. But on the figures of the past
year there is certainly nothing for shareholders to
be cheerful about. The best that can be said is that
things are not as bad as they were. But the shock-
incj overloading of the co. at the start is still the
lion that stands between them and a decent return.
* * * *
In spite of the almost world-wide adoption
of the flotation or froth process, the parent Minerals
Separation Go. in England did not pay a dividend
for last year. The support of patents in law courts
is a costly business.

(Karangahake) pays £43,125 (2s. 6d. on 345,000),
and Waihi £25,000 (Is. on 500,000). Dividends
from tin mines are numerous, but they are usual h
of small amount. Tongkah Harbor and Tongkah
Compound (Siam) are the most attractive; but
Mount Bischcff (Tas.)— distributing £6OOO per
month—will probably stand the test of_ tune better.
Briseis (Tas.) has proved a good alluvial tin mine
for it has paid its shareholders £382,500. They
evidentlv believe the Ringarooma leases and the
gold-dredging area in Victoria will pan out another
£300.000, for shares are at 10s. Bull gets the
first scent of a dividend and holds the bulk of the
shares. # »
Some of the strong Westralian corporations
are combining to assist smaller and weaker ones in their
coming fight with the Moore Co. for alleged infringe-
ment If patent A defence fund of £25,000 either
has been or is being subscribed, and the combina-
tion may be extended to include all the Australian
mining cos. concerned in vacuum filtration. Already
an action has been commenced by the Moore people
against the Talisman, and a Victorian co. has been
threatened with a writ.

Commodore (W.A.) recovered £7914 from
ore treatment during the half-year ended November,
and made a working profit of £2066. The manager
thinks that the large tonnage of low-grade ore above
the 300 ft level should be augmented by the ensuing
six months’ development. When the b°°ks cl °sed the
co had £2121 in cash, and owed £lOO7. Its ad
mirers still speak hopefully of dividends, but
although one or two may come along, prospects are
too spotted at present to warrant shareholders ex-
pecting » * *
State-aided attempts are being made to
resurrect payable values on the North lead at Kan-
owna (W A.). Alluvial working in this locality was
abandoned some years ago owing to heavy water.
The flow is now being kept down, and hopes are en-
tertained locally that the prospecting now being done
will raise Kanowna from the dead, as there is plenty
of virgin ground to work. # #
Tindals (W.A.) has appointed a new
attorney, and proposes to declare its intentions at
the shareholders’ meeting in Melbourne on the 13th
inst. Meantime six months’ extension has been ob-
tained. About £140,000 has been spent to date,
and of this amount £97,000 represents gold taken
out of the mine and put back again. Development
is said to be very backward, and a report on the
property by some expert of standing would materially
help shareholders in deciding whether prospects jus-
tify further outlay. So far results have been much
below official anticipations, and it is doubtful if the
ore left in the mine is as good as has been officially
alleged.
* * * *
Recent developments in Associated North-
ern’s Ora Banda property present several interesting
features. The scene of operations is at 400 ft. or
thereabouts, where there are indications of a change
from oxide to sulphide. The low-grade lode-stuff
which was spread over a big width in the upper
levels has become concentrated, and the walls of the
ore channel are better defined. So far the rich shoot
has been followed continuously for 200 ft. ; and as
there is no distinct faulting, values (which, after
being high for nearly 150 ft. and sensational for a
few feet, are now poor) may get rich again at any
time. Not since the early days of Kalgoorlie has
such a length of uniformly high-grade stuff been
exposed, and its likeness to the wonderful Brownhill
pipe has been noted by more than one mining man.
A report from Adelaide states that Siberia
Consols flotation is assured. This show, situated near
Waverley (W.A.), has a big lode and occasional rich
patches. Three parcels, aggregating about 900 tons,
yielded £20,000; but unless the mine can go on pro-
ducing occasional large returns from small tonnages,
there isn’t likely to be much in it for a company.
Outside the patches, not a great deal to build on is
visible.
Hampden’s dividend of 4s. per share ab-
sorbed 70,000, so an official statement says. That
means 350,000 shares; so at last the long-standing
Baillieu option of 50,000 at par must have been
exercised. These shares have probably been dealt
in for a long time past, so their actual issue isn’t
likely to affect the market much. Whether due to
the tumble in copper, or the trouble at the mines, or
something else, the market quotations of late have had
a bad drop, and the announcement of the dividend
did not cause a revival. For a couple of years
Hampden ought to be able to earn plenty for an Bs.
to 10s. annual dividend ; but there is the lean time
ahead to be provided for, when the Hampden and
Duchess reserves shall have been worked out and
the outside mines must take up the running. Already
the co. is pushing along hard with the Macgregor.
The purchase has been completed at a price of
£108,750, the last half to be paid in six months’
time. Arrangements have been made with the
Queensland Government to supply sleepers and rails
tor the 25 miles between Malbon and Macgregor at
5 p.c. above cost. The Hampden Co. will do the
construction and own the line —until the Govern-
ment wants it. There is going to be a lot of dip-
ping into the purse. The policy of the two rival
cos., the Elliott and the Hampden, demands plenty
of cash. Present indications don’t point to the
exercise by the reputedly-Parisian crowd of the op-
tion on the remaining 50,000 shares at 565., in a
month’s time or thereabouts. It is no doubt plain
to these people that profits must keep extra-sub-
stantial to prevent the eo. returning to the weak
financial position from which it only recently
escaped.
* * * *
Hampden South Consols, Cloncurry (Q.).
has a fire underground ; but the only co. that will
suffer is Mount Elliott, which has been taking regular
consignments of ore from the old shaft now thrown
out of use. Luckily, a new main shaft has been
sunk 160 ft., and work from there can be pushed on
at a rapid rate. The Hampden Co.’s workings are
some 1500 ft. from the fire, so are not at all likely to
be affected. Elliott’s smelting return for January
(18 days) shows the reduced average of 10.37 p.c.
copper—36o tons of metal from 3469 tons of ore.
Nor is the average of 3.3dwt. of gold satisfactory,
compared with the old 4dwt. to sdwt. Elliott may
not trouble over a dwt. of gold, but it can t afford to
lose two units of copper, worth close on 30s. The
annual report to June 30 showed that net profit was
£4 per ton of ore (£158,443 from 39,933 tons).
The average extraction for the whole year was 13.1
p.c. copper. A reduction of grade to 10 p.c. would,
under similar conditions, slice the profit in halves, re-
ducing it to 40s. per ton.
* * * *
Great Fitzroy (Q.), afflicted with bad
weather, came through January with costs £156
ahead of the estimated revenue. The latter depends
on the price of copper, and in this case the base
metal was valued at £72 os. 6d. per ton. Revenue
was £14,556; costs, £14,400. Nothing is said about
the mine nowadays, and the lack of good develop-
ments at depth appears to be the cause of the silence.
The return of 11.6 p.c. copper in concentrates is
good; but costs are crushing, and the metallurgical
success is no consolation for a financial loss.
* * * *
Another bulk sample of five tons from the
Minnie Moxham, Northcote, Hodgkinson district
(Q.), has been treated at Chillagoe for 4oz. sdwt.
gold and 12oz. silver per ton. Gross value over
£lB per ton. People are beginning to take notice
of the deserted field, as there are a lot of reefs lying
idle that gave fine returns in the early days.^
The Chillagoe Co. announces its third
reconstruction. As a matter of fact, it is the disas-
trous concern’s eighth. The object of the present
shuffle is to raise £lBO,OOO, principally for the
development of the Mulligan coalfield. Present
shareholders are to be bled of another 3s. per share—
-6d on application, 6d. on allotment, and the rest as
required. Certainly, they needn’t be bled if they
don’t like the process—they can sell their shares in
the market, and let somebody else thus have the right
to apply for the same number of shares in the new
co. The usual bite is to be taken for underwriting,
though as the public will pay Is. 2d. to get the
shares, it seems a superfluous waste for the co. to
pay anybody to take the shares. However, this is
the Chillagoe Co. On the 100th reconstruction some-
body will probably propose that it be re-named the
Shiilingscome and the Poundsgo, Unlimited Lia
bility. # » *
Tasman and Crown Lyell ( Tasmania ih as
been brought up with a round turn by H. Warlow
Davies, of the Amalgamated Zinc, who Ji® n * Jf
tell the cold truth. He takes manager Carter s esti-
mate of 35,000 tons lead and zinc ores m the co. s
mine and gives the ore a value of 20 p.c. lead, 10
ozsilver and 14 p.c. zinc. This is better than any
Broken Hill mine can show; but that isn t every-
thing Then there is the pyritic formation going
about 34 p.c. copper and about soz. silver. And, on
top of these bodies-or below them-Davies.thinks
that the claim has chances of developing decent re-
serves But ore-treatment is the crux of the problem
His trial runs of the concentrating mill spelt high
costs and a low recovery. The fact is that the high
pvrites and their intimate admixture with the
galena necessitated the sliming of the ore, with a
consequent loss of lead and silver. So Davies advises
the Board to go strong on mining work and await a
process hinting all the while that one of the flotation
methods may do the trick. If smelters were near by
the co. could talk ; but it won t pay to try Zeehan,
and Mount Lvell doesn’t help other shows by accept-
ing dead-low returning charges. All that Tasman and
Lvell can do is to expand the calling power to provide
cash, and then wait for the right process.

Mount Balfour copper mines and land-
railway project in nor’-west Tasmania is feeling very
unwell Hector MacDonald has been to London to get
the money, but J. Bull isn’t on. So the option he
held to the end of the year has gone into the waste-
paper basket. Now it is said that another influential
group is on the mat waiting to help the patient. If
that be so, what has become of the Mertz folk, whose
well-thumbed report on Balfour did such duty in
Collins-street ? The Bulletin never would have
Mount Balfour as a copper field, and it hasn t seen
reason to change its views about the squibby shoots
there; nevertheless, the rich country in the hinter-
land of the Stanley deserves a railway, and there as
scope for a clear-cut deal to provide funds. Mean-
time a reconstruction scheme is offered ; it is proposed
to create a nominal £99,000 of capital by the issue
of 9900 shares at £lO each; 4900 of these can be
taken up by those who have their bit in the co. at
325. 6d. per share. This, however, won’t drive home
many dog-spikes or lay many rails, so it is clear that
some fat man will still have to be chased. Hector
MacDonald mav have some one in tow ; but unless he
has, the wisdom of hanging on to Mount Balfour has
still to be shown.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 10, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
It is cabled that the Prince of Wales is
learning the bagpipes at Oxford, and that
the swell undergrads, of that ancient city of
culchaw are all taking up the same game.
There will be an unholy racket around the
old squares and colleges when the mob has
mastered the roval art, and 50 Celtic laments
are howling at once on the night wind. Also,
it will be good business for the German
manufacturer, who in these degenerate days
supplies the patriotic Scot with the wailing
instruments.
Archbishop Kelly and Bishop Dwyer, of
Maitland, are drinking in the champagne air
on Kosciusko’s snowy pate. Rev. McDer-
mott, of Manly R.C. College, and the Rev.
J . Is orris will also foregather in the same
place towards the end of February.
Letters to the editors of daily papers con-
cerning, the Primacy of Peter have eased oft
while the combatants retired to cool their
heated brows in the surf or climb the snow
line of Kosciusko. Infuriated remarks re
the religion (which is presumably his affair)
of the coming Governor (Strickland)
have also retired from the morning press,
while the belligerents, whose tempers ap-
peared to be about 1000° in the shade, fan
themselves with the Walls of Derry for five
minutes or so. The return of Opposition-
leader C. G. Wade in renewed health is the
small star (urn of the week. Out of a long
interview in the Sydney Telegraph one
found a helpful line: “I did not find any
marked indication (in Japan) of a desire to
take of any part of this conti-
nent. Korea once had the same beautiful
faith in its adjacent brother.
I ew Sydney men, and about the same per-
centage of really busy women, waste their
afternoons, day after day, lapping up tea in
local parlors. In London the shortage of
Alen, other than the Tame Cat species, has
driven the “smart” hostess to search for im-
pecunious foreign dukes and other well-
mannered financial derelicts, at so much per
duke. They are known to Fleet-street re-
porters as four o’clock Fidos.” They are
faultlessly dressed from a tailor’s point of
view, and knock about London society in the
hope of picking, up an heiress. Equally im-
pecunious English Society matrons, irrever-
ently called E loaters,” affect to be much
interested in these carpet knights, and offer
to introduce them to pleasant London houses,
lhe Floaters pocket the fee which the
hostess hands out for each presentable young
man. A countess, in a hard-up old age,
who is a vigorous Floater, actually sent the
following list of terms she expected
for each attractive Fido’s appearance
at a select tea-struggle: Duke, £2 10s.
Duchess, £3. (A duchess knows too
™uch to be snared as easily as a
duke.) A marquis can be borrowed for an
hour at £1 10s. Barons, at a guinea a head,
are fairly olentiful.
A Russian lady of social tonnage, who was
giving an afternoon reception in the Thames
village last season, was staggered when an
English duchess wrote to offer her 10 young
men, and the same number of women all
titled, as guests. Her fee was only 50
guineas. Barons and baronesses must have
glutted the market just then. In Syd-
ney we have a few embryo Floaters. But
any foreign counts who get stranded
on these shores are either earning an honest
crust at cooking omelettes or hair-dressing
or they ve come to grief with their tailors
and can t be paraded on our best Axminster
squares. So our tame Floaters can only de-
pend on a few local side-lines at very reduced
prices.
. Government House (Macquarie-street) is
in the hands of the Law. Its woes and
wrongs will be told at length by
three wigs, Knox, K.C., and Langer
Uwen, K.C., and Bethune, to the *wig
on the bench. A solicitor in a bi" way
or business here, remarks that possiblv after
Gullen, C.J., Adrian Knox is the soundest
lawyer in N.S.W. So the Law will attack
the technical points of the raid on the G.-G.’s
roof with the thunder of much learning.
Various branches of the Cox family tree
which stuck its roots in the Mulgoa soil a
century or so ago, are refreshing the younger
limbs with Manly ozone just now. The
M illoughby Dowlings are surfing at the
same address.
Mr ?°. d Mrs - St - Vincent Welch and Miss
Mabel Kingsmill are off to Egypt some time
this month. Julius Superbus Knight, by the
way, told an interviewer the other day that
he hoped, as producer of “Bella Donna,” to
make the audience think they are in Egypt
to smell it, see it. and feel it.” The smells
of Cleopatra’s old haunts are many. If a
few of the worst brands were to take the
centre of the stage at the same time, the
front stalls would have to be promptly reno-
vated with eau-de-cologne. The better idea
would be to make Egypt smell less instead
of making the theatre smell more.
The veteran Fosbery. who carries as excess
luggage a C.M.G. bauble, was dined at the
Australia the other night. The festival was
heavily loaded with statistics, turned on by
•T. Randal Carey as vice-president of the
N.S.W. Savings Bank. Besides his one-time
reign as Inspector-General of Police in this
State, Fosbery has been a Voice of Import-
ance in the control of the Savings Bank since
1875. He now retires to sit at ease behind
his police pension.
Fleet-surgeon Beatty, R.N., who returned
here a few months ago, is now officially an-
nexed to the Cambrian in these waters.
He married a handsome North Sydney girl
when he was last on the Australian station,
so they both feel very much at home in Port
Jackson. They’re ardent tennis players,
and she is a Lady Racquet of some weight in
championship scraps.
Organising sec. Grace Burrows sat on the
rugged head of Mount York on Saturday,
while a fine, misty rain fell softly on the ad-
jacent scenery. For three months or so
to come, she’s in charge of the high jinks
that appertain to the Blue Mountain Cross-
ing Centenary. Processions that may begin
to grow in Penrith, and will spring up in
every mountain hamlet, are to finally sit
down together on Mount York one day in
May. A new water tank, to cost £lOO, or
thereabouts, will be an addition to the
scenery, likely to be much appreciated by
thirsty trippers to that historic spot. This
tank will not supply boiling water, and it
won’t wash clothes.
The Horace McMahons are floating
round these shores, and bobbed up at the
cricket match on Saturday. The McMahon
dame began life in Sydney as an infant
Moses. As Miss Moses she married Ban-
croft, a son of the well-known actor. His
death and the lady’s marriage with
McMahon are fairly middle-aged history.
Ernest Mclntosh, whom Farmer’s sent
round the world to seek the most up-to-date
things in restaurant management, and who,
returning, incorporated the fruits of his
search in the firm’s elaborate new cookery
department, has been snared by the Oriental
people in Melbourne. Before he left, to
succeed a manager whom the co. had im-
ported from Colombo, there were various
staff presentations, served up with a sauce
composed chiefly of directors’ felicitations.
Mr. Sam Hordern, who’s been pacing up
and down the war-worn face of Europe, is
to be entertained on his return with smoked
music. His employees, who give this revel
as a visible sign of their glad hand, have
dated the event for February 26. H. N.
Southwell is in charge of the programme.
An attractive widow is the subject of this
narrative. She was going off by rail for a
January holiday. A male relative was on
the station to wave adieu and tip the por-
ter. The tin seemed to have been of a size
not productive of exhilarating effects on the
tipped, so the lady added another expression
of good will. She hurriedly slipped the coin
into an envelope and passed it into the ever-
open palm. The recipient went off, only to
return with his face laid out in a large pat-
tern of smiles. “Thank you, Madam,” said
he, “I shall keep that envelope for the rest
of my life.” When the widow searched her
handbag she hissed an envelope that had
enclosed a New Year card on which were
written the words. “With much love. Wish-
ing you a happy New Year.”
The Manly Surf Club braves dared the
horrors of the deep per ferryboat, and landed
at the Circular Quav on Sunday morning.
Thence they journeyed to Bondi to lunch
with the local Braves who plunge into the
breakers to snatch careless bathers from the
jaws of the prawn and prevent them being
sat upon by the whale at the sea-bottom
where Clarence had his famous dream. The
club rooms had been swept and garnished for
the occasion, and profusely decorated with
lifebuoys and other marine monsters. Dur-
ing the day, the crowd on the beach failed
to take advantage of the influx of life-savers
to any appreciable extent. A lady surfer
was the only minor disaster. She had inad-
vertently swallowed too much breaker, but
was amenable to the combined efforts of two
surf clubs which pumped Pacific Ocean out
of her digestive organs. A Bondi surfer, by
the way, has only a sporting chance of
drowning himself in a final and conclusive
manner. The local life-savers include seven
or eight budding sawbones who know just
how to roll or thump sopping humanity, and
won’t give it a chance to die in peace.
“The beaches,” complained a confirmed
surfer, “will be so safe in a few years that
a header off the cliffs will be the only dash
of danger good swimmers will be able to
locate. The life-savers are so persistent that
four men regularly patrol Bondi water-front
to prevent young fools getting their deserts.
Meantime, the sneak thief accumulates a
prodigious wardrobe, and also picks up bank
notes, gold watches, etc. A clothes-saving
club is so badly wanted that I’m thinking
of calling for tenders. The tenderers will
have to give proof positive that they have
walked home at least twice clad in a bor-
rowed overcoat and one sock.”
This reminds me incidentally of an en-
raged family living in a costly suburb. It
included two scapegrace sons who more than
once came home in the dead of night in a cab
and clad in a newspaper apiece, and clam-
ored to the old man to come down and save
the family honor by defraying the cab fare.
They had lost not only their money but
their clothes at some heathenish game—two-
up, perhaps.
The Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society
holds its annual meeting as I write. This
is a joyful event to show that it is
alive and high-kicking after some months
of coma. Conductor Alfred Hill is able to
patch up any weak places, and will half-sole
and heel the society while you wait, till it
looks better than new.
The Westralian sailing men made a lot of
friends in this city. Their departure for
their native Swan River was trimmed with
much sea-chanty and extracts of musical
comedy. The \Y.A. boys crawled up the
Omrah’s rigging to yell good-bye to a wharf
full of acquaintances.
The Sydney Hospital will have gathered in
a cheque for the Stadium f§te before this
meets your long-distance range of vision,
Arini. The floral motor will also have
honked its way in search of prizes in the
rush for cash.
The Trumper testimonial match had its
second day out on Saturday on a damp wic-
ket. The brown hill, bleached by the Janu-
ary sun, was dotted with devotees by 3
p.m., and the members’ stand was comfortably
filled. The sawdust bagmen trotted across
the ground, and deposited their soft clods of
foothold on the sodden patch. Then Macart-
ney went on hitting balls. A few feathers
of extra length uncurled themselves in the
wet atmosphere. Here and there Trumper’s
admirers slaked their thirst from the Ther-
mos flask and bit a hurried end off a sand-
wich. And Macartney went on smacking
balls. The Ernest Broughtons materialised
in a mass of cricket enthusiasm. John Lem-
mone’s musical nose appeared on the offing.
The veteran Mrs. George Kellick skipped
into her seat. The J. J. Cohens were firmly
entrenched in a good position, with no posts
to block the view. And Macartney went on.
“Thank goodness,” says a flapper, “he’s going
to give us a chance to see Trumper at last!”
So Macartney packed up his score at 91, and
the only Victor stamped across the green.
Trumper’s reception must have been very
good for his bump of appreciation, and
rather bad for, his cricket. An uproar of
cheers, mingled with the blast of “He’s a
Jolly Good Fellow” from the full strength of
a brass band, and a tendency to keep on
cheering if he only missed a ball, may have
given the mighty batsman a touch of cricket-
itis, for he hadn’t piled up more than 27
when the rain tumbled down and the day-
light began to melt away into a thin grey
mist. A few hard-working persons, includ-
ing little Vera Spaull, of “Blue Bird” fame,
sold autographed photos, of the hero of the
wicket. But they didn’t get rid of as many
Trpmper signatures as they might have done
if they’d had a few more arms and legs.
Did you notice that in one list of sub-
scribers to the Victor Trumper fund, “Two
lady admirers” gave ss. as a joint expres-
sion of their affection for cricket. This
reckless extravagance is one of the signs of
the times. I suspect these admirers were
flappers, and had gone bankrupt on choco-
lates and “Milestones.”
To his friend “Hop,” the late George Rig-
nold left his violin. “Hop,” who makes
fiddles as a hobby, and plays them as a pas-
time, says it is a fine sample of the “Old
Masters’” period of Italian violin work. It
is built on Amatese lines, and is the work of
a cunning craftsman named Guido Tonsoni.
It is a ripe old veteran of over two cen-
turies, but is still sound in body, and has a
mellow, vigorous voice. This was the in-
strument used by Rignold when he began
life as a fiddler in a theatrical orchestra.
The ancient wooden case is scarred and bat-
tered in its long struggle to shield its preci-
ous contents from the attacks of wind,
weather, and truculent baggage smashers.
Venerable luggage labels make a topdressing
that cover it with signs of wander-thirst.
The old fiddle was Rignold’s companion till
the last curtain fell.
Long ago, in a deadly combat with
a stage villain, Rignold injured one of the
fingers of his left hand. For years after-
wards, it was bent, and too stiff to do a
fair day’s work. George wanted that finger
on his fiddle, and one day showed the jibbing
member to a medical friend. “I can set that
right for you,” says Lancet. They made an
appointment. “Now, go ahead,” said the
old actor, declining the usual whiff of chlo’.
He lit a cigar, and Lancet made a successful
slash or two at the crippled joint. So to
the end of his days Rignold was able to ex-
tract comfort from rubbing the inside of a
cat with the tail of a horse.
veteran actor George Rignold left
his Middle Harbor property, Bra.vbrook.
with its furniture and effects, “to his friend
Miss Maude Styan, as an appreciation of
her services to himself and his late wife.”
Miss Styan, who is a sister of actor Arthur
Stvan, took a hand in shaping household
affairs in Rignold s leafy retreat on the
water-lapped shores of Middle Harbor. In
that Pleasant Bohemian patch, she was re-
saf5 a f^ ed “ the P erfect brick” type of house-
hold goddess.
Organist C. Hellemann has been ap-
pointed conductor of the Wellington (M.L.)
Royal Choral Society. He leaves this port in
April. By June he will have learnt th«
Right Way to hold on his hat when a We i
ington zephyr tries to blow it out to sea
You do this by crowding your head against
the wall. Hellemann first imbibed musie
from his mother when he was some sort of
an infant. She was a good mother, but onlv
fair to medium as an amateur, and she
merely hoped to fill her small son with the
rudiments of piano lore. The end came
when the youthful student, searching for the
truth, put a dizzy technical question to his
progenitor. Her reply was the baseless fabric
of a dream. It belonged to the concertina or
mouth-organ branch of the musical art
After that Hellemann took his musical edn’
cation in hand himself. Later he was one
of two students who snatched diplomas as
associates of the Royal College of Music
London. The other, by a queer coincidence’
also came from Sydney, but in another
clime, being a Blue Nose from the Nova
Scotian fogs. There is a horrible place
called Sydney among the fish and snows of
Nova Scotia. C. Hellemann has a good
record here as organist, pianist, composer
and conductor. “By Babylon’s Wave,” one
of his deeds in orchestration, was product
by the Sydney Phil. Society when hS
held the baton, though Babylon never had
much of a wave so far as history shows So
Wellington can slap itself on its back when
it is able to spare a hand from its hat brim
for getting hold of the versatile Hellemann. ’
While the Shakspeare Tercentenary com-
mittee is getting into its stride, reminiscent
citizens have chewed off a small slice of
Milton, as thus :
What needs my Shakspeare for his honored bones
The labor of an age in piled stones,
Or that his hallowed ashes should be hid?
and so forth. In spite of Milton, who had
been dead too long to stay her hand, Mary
Lamb served up a mild decoction of William
for the infant mind, and Hamlet’s “To be”
stalks the boards at every other school
break-up. Piled bricks are likely to grow
on to one end of the Mitchell Library, if the
last meeting of the Tercentenary folks comes
to a cash crisis. A threat of Morris dances
round a proposed statue of the Bard eman-
ated from Mr. S. H. Bowden, and was
firmly rejected by those present. The
cheering prospect of some day seeing a Gaud
Mayor leading a Gaudy Mayoress to trip
the heavy fantastic sole round William’s
bust, while other serious citizens followed
suit, may be said to have been blighted by
the cold blast of anti-Morris dancers’ dis-
approval.
The recent flare-up over the wine license
in drapers’ shops, and the wrath of the Tem-
perance party, seems to have been prema-
ture. The average Australian woman is
such a confirmed tea-tippler that she has
more or less sold herself, in the luncheon
hour, to a small, brown devil called Tan-
nin. He lives in the bottom of the teapot,
and bites large holes in our nerves. Every
now and then, a medical authority rises
up to slay this Imp with a claret bottle, but
he sticks to his victim like a mountain leech.
Some women drink wine with lunch, but
they mostly congregate in more expensive
than a draper’s restaurant. The
Cold Watef party has been ringing the wrong
bell, and has got cold in its eye looking
through the wrong keyhole. In spite of
many wine licenses, the Teapot is still the
prevailing vice in humble homes. So much
for Mother’s alleged crime of looking at the
wine when it is Baby Hock, over the edge of
a bargain counter. What about Father’s
grown-up whisky?
Red is threatened as the prevailing color
of the Easter dress parade. Most of the big
shops are already opening their autumn
goods, while perspiring women gasp in the
presence of fur-trimmed finery. The red hat
(bold, staring, unmitigated red that can’t be
called crimson” unless you choose to turn
your back on the lady who lives at the
bottom of a well) with tall, spiky trails of
the same eye-aching shade, are going to blaze
a fierce trail of color round the early Easter
bun. The last syllable in an autumn French
model is a three-quarter red velvet jacket
slashed with pale lemon, to wear with a
purple velvet vown. If the lady who buys
this luxury will add a red hat with a green
osprey, and wear the lot at Randwick, we
shall all enjoy ourselves.
The short, cut-away coat of royal blue or
purple silk, plain or shot, is a blazing indis-
cretion these warm days. It is worn over
a cream or white gown, and enhances the
heat-wave complexion of the wearer by a
few degrees. The short coat is obviously
going to be a feature of autumn frocking.
Like Joseph’s, it will be of many colors. A
black velvet garment of this kind, worn over
a white muslin dress, met my eye on a
98deg.-in-the-shade morning last week. The
owner of this wrap was one of our Most
Expensive people, so black velvet must be
worn, even in the sweat of their brow, by
those who pull the forelock of fashion.
Your old friend “Cleo” will take up my pen
while I imn the rock wallabies in a "holi-
day scramble. A _ mountain fastness at the
end of Nowhere will be my address for three
weeks.

The New TRIUMPH

Q
rtlt
You already know the reputation the ordinary
Triumph has gained. You have probably heard
of its wonderful exploits—how it has kept to the
front in innumerable speed trials; how it has
staunchly stood severe endurance tests, and what
remarkable distances it has travelled on a small
consumption of fuel.
To all these merits, add the advantages of an
engine that may be started with the machine
standing, waits while you leisurely sit in the
saddle, and then gathers speed by simply turning
a small lever. Consider, also, that it has three-
speeds that can be used at will, and you will under-
stand what a splendid mount the Three-Speed
“Triumph” will make.
Come in and talk Motor Cycles with us at our
showrooms. We’ll explain every detail of the
mechanism and give you a working demonstration.
It will be a lesson on Motor construction and
mechanism that will be interesting and always
useful. It places no obligation on you. Open

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 10, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Saturday, the big day of the Northcote
Cup contests, was just as unsatisfactory for
yachtsmen as the capricious weather could
make it. St.-Ivilda pier looked like a bee-
swarm from the commanding heights of the
Esplanade. Light dresses and parasols were
out of the question in such a cold wind.
Girls tied little hats on their heads with
veils, and the men who didn’t hold on their
headgear with one hand wore it clamped
under one arm. The waves leaped against
the pier, and stinging showers of spray
lashed the crowd; but the enthusiasts clung
to the wet planking, and strained their eyes
towards the stormy west, where a few little
sails were scurrying and bending before the
fierce blasts. Victoria’s representative, Kil-
lara, had the bad luck to lose a minute and a
half at the start, and never made it up. In
fact, it dropped further behind. Owner
Marshall is a keen sport, and, having just
bought the boat, was naturally eager to sail
it himself. Unfortunately, his knowledge of
the bay is limited, and experienced Vic-
torians growled steadily in undertones be-
cause there was not an experienced bay salt
at the helm.
Before the briny contest started, G.-G.
Denman and his lady skimmed along in one
of the purple cars, and boarded the torpedo
boat Countess of Hopetoun. The Yacht
Club’s launch and various other crowded
craft rolled heavily in the vicinity. On the
previous day (Friday), the Denman lady
was absent. _ She had just got ashore from
the Tasmanian steamer after a choppy trip
across the Strait, and probably did not want
to see any more waves for a few hours. On
this occasion, the pretty Barttelot dame and
her Gentleman Help husband accompanied
the G.-G. After they had fled seaward in
the little Countess, the yellow car of the
Fullers rolled along, and the State pair,
accompanied by a careful selection of the
family, boarded the Giles family yacht. If
there had been a smaller potentate to follow
Fuller, he would have had to swim out with
his cocked hat in his teeth.
Laid, on Bth February, the foundation-
stone of the new club house of the Victorian
Bagmen’s Association. The building, which
is situated in Flinders-street, on the site of
the historic Grice’s Bond, will soar to a
height of 148 ft., and will gaze down on every
structure in Melbourne. The history of the
Ass. is a tale of rapid growth. The first
start was made in 1881, when rooms were
taken at Phair’s Hotel. Until 1885, various
pubs housed the thirsty bagmen. Then they
collected their samples and shifted to rooms
above the Argus office. The old dame
lodged them for three years, at the end of
which period the strain of living up to the
landlady’s Tory principles forced the bag-
men round the corner to Queen’s Walk.
Their club rooms there have been occupied
by the Savage Club since 1899, when a move
was made to the building next the Metro-
politan Gas Co. The cost of the new shanty
is £86,606, towards which the now prohibited
poker machine must have contributed a tidy
bit.
The discarded Melbourne dog will have his
day on February 22, when the Denman lady
is to formally open the sanctuary for stray
barkers. Tripp Edgar, of the first Asche-
Brayton co., organised a theatrical benefit in
aid of the four-legged orphans and widows,
and a small group of sympathisers have
evolved a lost doggery at North Melbourne.
The first reception will be held shortly. The
hon. secretary, Mrs. Arthur Payne, is now
travelling in England, but will be represented
at the solemn ceremony by Miss Harvey.
Two hundred and sixty male human beings—-
to give the exact figures—are scrambling for
the job of caretaker.
One day last week, the Japanese naval
visitors tramped like clockwork figures up
the Town Hall marble stairs to shake hands
with the Gaud Mayoral couple. The only
one of them who smiled was the Admiral,
and he smiled all the time; apparently, he
does the laughing for the squadron. He even
laughed in the intervals of the unsuitable
organ recital which followed. The solemn
booming of the organ suited the wooden
aspect of the Soya and Adzuma people. They
sat in long rows quite motionless and gazing
at nothing. Some of the men look like tiny
dolls, and the cast of features varies from
noses decidedly tip-tilted to the aquiline
bend. Some of the faces give a hint of the
whereabouts of the Lost Tribes of Israel.
Their remarkable caDacity for sitting still
and saying nothing gives one a fine impres-
sion of massed intelligence and wisdom. It
may be quite undeserved.
Captain Tickell and Gaud Mayor Hen-
nessy took charge of the cheery Admiral, and
sat him in the centre seat of state. Mrs.
Ilennessy, looking very brave in blue and
waving feathers, and Mrs. Tickell, in grey,
decorated the party. At tea time, society
matrons swooped down on the officers and
talked relentlessly at them. One impressive
dame was detected talking to a pedigreed
and highly-educated Asiatic as if he had been
a vegetable John. The visitor countered
by looking as stupid as possible until she
ran down and sidestepped disgustedly to
the refreshments. Maddens, hßecketts, Mil-
lers and Paynes spread fine clothes at the
function. Mrs. Agar Wynne, just back from
Neerim station, was in blue. Mrs. Godfrey,
in black and white and under a white lancer
plume, steered a daughter in pink. Defence-
Minister Pearce smiled amiably at the in-
vaders, and Mrs. Pearce gracefully inhabited
mole-colored draperies. The Brighton may-
oral Showers and the Dunbar Hoopers were
other visitors.
Organist Price, a quite serious-minded
musician, is actually accused of playing a
joke on the visiting Jans. For their recep-
tion, last week, to the visiting fleeters the
Gaud Mayoral Hennessys turned on the vast
organ. Price burrowed amongst his music
for something suitable, and discovered some
selections which started with a Jap anthem
and ended with a war march. Unfortu-
nately, a naf'e of the brilliant “Mikado”
music had been dovetailed in—probably to
offset the heavily solemn national airs. Gil-
bert and Sullivan’s satire is gall to the in-
tensely serious brown men —so much, in
fact, that a farsighted official put it on the
shelf when the Japanese fleet was visiting
London some years ago. The visitors stood
the melodious gibe very well, all except one
midshipman, who plumped down on his
chair. However, a watchful officer imme-
ately directed him to stand asrain. Price,
the Gaud Mayor, and the visiting Admiral
have since been tangled up in an excessively
polite correspondence full of honorable
abasement and flowery phrases. This is the
sort of thing that makes the Labor people’s
proposed six-hour day a blank impossi-
bility.
At the A.N.A. show at the Exhibition
one regards the hygiene set-outs in dumb
astonishment. The 145.-a-week menu sug-
gestions, arranged on plates and carefully
sprinkled with red pepper to protect them
from hungry visitors, attract most atten-
tion. The Spartan fare, which allows no
dripping for breakfast on Tuesday because a
very thin sausage is catered, does not seem
to impress the prodigal working-man as it
should.. The skim milk doesn’t raise much
enthusiasm either; and the black sausage
for Wednesday’s dinner is openly smiled at.
As for flies, the wicked-looking giant models
of the brutes and the shuddersome display
of germs and other products of the fly in-
dustry are calculated to frighten appetite
from black sausage evermore. The model
kitchen sports an Axminster hearth-rug, and
the dresser is such a magnificent affair that
you couldn’t think of insulting it by impaling
the grocer’s order on it with a pin. The
one profound .mystery which remains un-‘
solved to the bitter end is why all the con-
sumptives in the hygienic pictures are wear-
ing pink slippers. Do the slippers account
for the disease, or does the tuberculosis tint
the footgear?
Governor Fuller, whenever he visits the
A.N.A. Exhibition (a frequent occurrence,
by the way), always gravitates towards the
striking timber exhibit, where great logs of
timber turn glassy, polished surfaces towards
the visitor. As a side asset, from a builder’s
point of view, huge slabs of Australian
marble, polished and in the rough, stand like
frozen giant sentries about the court. The
beautiful Queensland woods are very popu-
lar; and there are many fine trees that are
not represented. Those on view represent
just a few. specimens from the forest
treasury. Victorian and Westralian woods
have been ruthlessly thinned out. Black-
wood —a lovely timber in all stages—is now
so scarce that, two years a~o, the panelling
one room at the University cost over
£lOOO. Now blackwood is almost worth its
weight in gold. Yet it grows freely, and
used to be in plenty on the adjacent West-
ernport peninsula. Nothing is being done to
preserve the existing blackwood, or to plant
new groves. An Englishman settler at West-
ernport has a mile-long blackwood avenue;
but it is now an isolated beauty spot. The
tree has virtues that should have commended
it to the bush people who had no time to
worry about the preservation of natural
beauty. “They beheld the forest and at-
tacked it blindly with steel and with fire.”
I think that home-made epitaph might wear
well on the tombstones of the men who suf-
fered from timber rage and dreamt always of
cleared and shadeless paddocks. On Satur-
day morning, Fuller brought his lady
along to admire, and she gladly paid homage
to the tree gods in an adorable purple feath-
ered hat, before wandering along to the cook-
ing lecture.
. Mrs.. Donald, the doctor’s wife who was
killed in the Aspendale motor accident, was
a magnificently-built blonde, and only 26
years old. She was the proud mother of
three children, and had promised herself a
fine holiday abroad just as soon as they had
recovered from some slight infantile com-
plaint.
On a recent Saturday a dignified barris-
ter stalked up and down one of the Flinders-
street railway platforms, waiting for the
seaside train that was to take him home.
He carried a large leather bag, and all be-
holders were wondering how many briefs he
was taking with him to study in the ti-tree,
when a steady drip of amber fluid from one
corner began to make an alcoholic trail on
the platform. But he stalked on gravely.
until a smiling stranger touched him on the
arm and told him that the case had broken
down. Mr. Brownbeer, K.C., has informed
the honorable court that he will never again
carry it home. In future, it will be sent.
Young squattocrat Ware, who is staying
at the Australian Club, sensationally
smashed his car in the early hours of a
recent moraine. One passenger is in hospi-
tal and another is carrying round a medically
boxed arm. Fortunately, in the instant of
the smash, he had the presence of mind to
turn off the lights and thus prevent a possi-
ble holocaust.
Miss Browne, daughter of “Dad” Browne
(Rolf Boldrewood), is taking a dip into
father’s line of business, and has a novel
ready for launching. The authoress, who
has just come back from South Africa,
admits that the story touches three con-
tinents. Chirnside relations and the River-
ina squattocracy are ordering dozens of the
work.
Camperdown girls have gone quite crazy
over the news that auburn-haired Lexy Reid,
daughter of squatter “Eddington” Reid, has
announced her engagement to William Con-
sett Walker, of Fairlie Grange (N.S.W.).
The wedding, which is to be quiet, is to hap-
pen on the evening of February 19, at Scots’
Church.
Gladys Chirnside, who has her own
cheque book, and makes swallow flights to
foreign places whenever she feels restless, is
just now in her woolly home nest in the
Western District. She has secured as play-
fellow a particularly jolly Irish girl called
Judith Davidson. They are at Caranballac,
the Gordon Chirnside palace, and put in their
time practising polo in the big paddocks and
gossiping with Mrs. Hodges.
Doris Robb is now convalescent and
motoring about after a spell of private hos-
pital. Mrs. Cornish had her under her wing
at Mount Martha.
Miss Wilson, of Westralia, is wandering
through Melbourne on her way to join niece
Mrs. Raleigh in Sydney. The dressy Mrs.
Raleigh is said to have dropped frocks as
a hobby, and taken to surfing parties.
Mrs. Davidson, who has turned down the
Billabong station and the Murray climate,
and come to live in St. Kilda, lately enter-
tained a crowd of folks at a musical frivol.
The small hostess was in moonlight fixings
of blue and silver. The Gaud Mayoress,
with a streak of flame-color on her inky garb,
gathered round her the youth of the party.
Bank-manager Pohlman’s wife showed a gar-
nishing of spangles, while Mrs. Etheridge
sported a grey cloudy gown with a silver
lining. Lizzie Newbold, who is patiently
waiting for her mother to regain her health
before starting off in search of further in-
struction, lifted up her valuable voice.
Flautist Amadio melodiously seconded her
efforts. Mrs. Betty Brooke, just back from
Maoriland, also enriched the programme.
The fiercest blast of.summer was turned
on to the wedding of Blanche Cranston and
squatter Hayes. The drooping flowers
which helped to fill St. John’s Church, Mal-
vern (the scene of the ceremony), looked
more limp than the perspiring guests; but
the guests’ collars looked limper than the
flowers. The bride, who is the youngest
daughter of Walter Scott Cranston, from
Caulfield way, was in white and wore Mrs.
Fashion’s latest idea—a hand-embroidered
veil. Sister Ethel and Muriel Young made
two nice lavender-tinted maids. Mrs. Cran-
ston, expensively upholstered in filmy black
over orchid mauve, was supported by a
Kiddle brother and sister. The Granthams
and Mrs. Ambler, with ladders of Maltese
lace propped against a black setting, were
prominent figures in the assembled company.
Colonel Jack Stanley is packing his trunks
for Ceylon. The warrior has not worn out
the carpet of his flat much during the past
three months. Part of the time he was in
Tasmania.
Mrs. Walter Bayles, who was one of the
late Dr. Gray’s batch of pretty daughters,
has just returned from England. The three
little Bayles girleens have been interesting
the Block since the maternal return. They
are garbed in black and white checks which
make uncle Norman Bayles’ wildest lounge
suit look tame and unexciting.
Colin Harper, the son of William and
grandson of Robert, was quite seriously in-
jured in the Macedon motor accident, whilst
his young cousin Margaret, the Darnley-
Naylors’ _ ewe lamb, is suffering from shock
and bruises. Professor Naylor, with his
wife and child, has just returned from a trip
to England, and is spending a little time here
before returning to the Adelaide University.
The Professor in his salad days owned a fine
tenor voice, and occasionally burst into
Greek love songs, much to the delight of the
ladies. When he wasn’t doing that, he was
lecturing on the deceased language at our
own armchair of learning at Parkville.
Mrs. Neil Crowley, who has been in Syd-
ney with brother Alec Hay and the family,
waited to see the Philip Mortons return from
the jaunt abroad, and then hurried home to
Toorak and went down with an attack of
pneumonia. However, she is already well
enough to take nourishment and a languid
interest in autumn fashions.
Frank Gavan Duffy, who ascends the Hit*
Court Bench after a shining career at th
Bar, is a living instance of the success of
hard work. Costs, so to speak, run in th
family; but Frank pursued the animal in
all its haunts, and snared it with horsehair
until it became so tame that it lay down at
his feet and licked his legal boots. And last
week he shooed it out of his chambers The
new Judge has one great asset which his
distinguished father never possessed—a good
speaking voice. The witty and well-reasoned
speeches of Duffy, sen., are impressive things
to read ; but his thin, almost squeaky voice
spoilt them in delivery. And he had an un
fortunate trick of making frequent nervous
halts. Old. politicians well remember the
peculiar effect of his thin, high voice when
as Speaker of the Assembly, he gave a
ruling.
Mrs. Gilruth, wife of the Northern Terri-
tory Administrator, is at present raiding the
Melbourne shoos. She has had her bovs
seasiding at Frankston. They are a lusty
outdoor crowd, and their mother declares
that, though there is an excellent doctor in
Darwin, he has not paid a professional visit
to the house during their months of resi-
dence. “We have never been so well,” says
the young matron. She thinks the Territory
climate really tones one up, and -says she has
lost the languid feeling the Victorian sum-
mer heat used to induce. Professor Nan-
son’s prettilv fair daughter who companions
her and helps teach the children, has the
same glad word for the maligned place. At
intervals they ride and motor far afield
bumping over roughness hidden in the floor
of the roadless and grassy wilderness. Mrs
Gilruth has an aboriginal nurse-girl, whom
she find* most adaptable. This young per-
son has become an expert needlewoman. She
is in Melbourne with the family, and is fas-
cinated by the shops. Melbourneites turn
and stare at the hanpv. brown-faced girl in
the dainty clothes of civilisation, wondering
where she came from. And very few of them
guess that she came from Australia.
The motor-car which is to be raffled for
the benefit of the hospital nurses, trundles
round town without pause on begging expedi-
tions. Another motor, cleverly disguised in
painted canvas as a destroyer, darted round
town the other night clad in electric lights,
by way of advertising the good cause. The
charitable crew later on suppered themselves
at a cafe as a reward for their efforts.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Dr. Hilda Florey is one of the eight newly-fledged
medicoes who are to be “Residents” at the Adelaide
Hospital for the forthcoming year.
Ex-Mayor Edwin Smith is off to England in a
month or so. Being but 83, he should have a cheery
time. His daughter, Mrs. G. H. Dean, will chaperone
him.
The local ’Varsity has been given £lO,OOO by Mr.
R. Barr Smith. The idea is to get a pound-for-pound
subsidy from the Government, and make the learn-
ing-factory more or less residential. Once we get
the system of living in colleges we may expect “rag-
gings,” bonfires in the quad, wine-clubs, “scouts”
and a thousand other old-world luxuries.
R. J. Phillips, one of D. and J. Fowler’s advisers-
m-chief, is convalescent, after a strenuous bout with
The Reaper. The Ancient made several attempts at
a knock-out, but Mr. Phillips parried the scythe with
considerable skill.
Mrs. J. M. Halloran, who has been visiting the
Adelaide section of her clan, returned to Westralia
on Friday.
Clergyman Nutting and his bride—she who was
Miss Barbara Andrews—have been cooling down at
Robe before boiling down at Port Pirie.
Miss Martha Bruggemann, who has been for some
time in England, studying singing under the patron-
age of the Girls’ Realm, is expected back before
Easter.
Miss French, of Mount Gambier, has published a
collection of short sketches. A local paper referred
to one of them as “Butter-sweet.” Is this action-
able? I leave it to the lawyers. The French family
has long been suspected of brains. One sister paints,
and their brother is an archdeacon.
Mrs. Harry Ayers and her daughter are leaving
for England in March. The Misses Cornish, who
have been staying with their sister, Mrs. Halcombe,
return to England at the end of this month.
Miss Dorothy Luscombe, the tall and divinely
fair maiden who scored hits in “The Im-
portance of Being Earnest” here and in Sydney, has
been staying with Mrs. Harry Dutton at Victor
Harbor.
The Hornabrooks have sold their house on Robe
Terrace to the Cowells, and are going to England.
By the way, if this exodus Fogwards doesn’t ease
down soon, I look like being imperilled as to my
job. At the present rate it seems as though I
shall one day have to write to you the bald words:
All Adelaide is leaving for England. And the follow-
ing week you will hear the grim news that I have
had to take to work.
A herd or covey of our very wealthiest motored
to Strathalbvn on Saturday, and drank tea with the
Launcelot Stirlings, what time the local players
were being defeated by Adelaide to the tune of
four goals to one. Towards the end it became
more of a dirge than a tune. The Bagots, Law
Smiths, Kyffin Thomases, Crawfords and Barretts
were amongst the onlookers.
Dr. Gertrude Halley, the new medical officer in
the State schools, has a useful record. She gradu-
ated in Melbourne, and, since then, has worked good
and hard in Tasmania, New South Wales and Vic-
toria. She is joint author of a cute visual test for
scholars.
A wedding of interest to the squatting fraternity
is billed for March. The bride’s father trafflcks in
stock and stations, and the bridegroom is one of a
big sheep-raising clan.
An amateur production of “Lady Windermere’s
Fan” is threatened in mid-April. The profits, as-
there are any, will go to the S.P.C.A. The
deed will probably be done at the Theatre Royal.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A sorrowful feature of the Sydney Poli-
tical Labor League conference is the reso-
lution that the working day should be cut
down to six hours. Even with the eight-
hour system N.S.W. seems to be so far from
earning enough to keep itself that it is now
borrowing at the glorious rate of £9,000,000
per annum. It is also using up the gold re-
serves in the banks in an alarming fashion
to pay for imported goods because it doesn’t
make nearly enough goods in its eight-hour
day to supply its wants. If the present
system of government lasts the State will
soon have to work nine hours a day or else
file its schedule.
PROGRESSIVE.
GRAN'MA: “Git hout of that thing an ’ git on
this. D'ye want to git killed?"
THE BOY: “Rats! I want to get somewhere."
George Luke Prendergast, son of the
highly ineffective leader of the Victorian
Labor party, has sworn two affidavits which
help to explain his parent’s desire for a trip
to Europe just now. Being bereft of his
billet as secretary of the Vic. branch of the
Tramway Employees’ Association and Pre-
sident of the Federal Council thereof, this
lamentable Prendergast is supporting the
Brisbane Tramway Co.’s application to the
High Court against the enforcement of
Judge Higgins’s award in the notorious
tramways case. G.L.P. goes the whole hog
in his second affidavit
I say that the statement made by me in answer to
a question by his Honor, the president, that I did not
enter the Malvern service for the purpose of forming
a union, is incorrect; and I further say that I en-
tered such service for the purpose of forming a union
and creating a dispute.
At the conference, after it had been discovered that
none of the Queensland men had signed forms of ap-
plication to become members of the claimant associa-
tion. .. .forms were signed and ante-dated.
Perhaps the T.E.A. is well rid of its late
president. His methods were unbusiness-
like, his word was untrustworthy, and his
loyalty to the cause evaporated when his
salary stopped.
Jo. Cook told the people of Warragul
(Vic.) the other day that he had only two
planks to his platform. One plank is the
necessity of getting the present Government
out of office, the other is the maintenance of
the solidarity of the Liberal party. Those
are not planks ; they are only shingles under
which Cook hopes to creep out of the wet.
Was ever a political party leader so many
shingles short?
It is rumored that the presence in N.S.W.
of Mr. Joseph Tatlow, member of the Im-
perial Trade Commission, shortly due in
Melbourne, will be availed of by the Govern-
ment for a discussion on railwav matters.
Tatlow is regarded as a big authority; he
has managed lines in England, Ireland and
Scotland, and has been chairman of various
railway commissions. It may be admitted
that a consultation with such a man - tnay
ornve illuminating, but if Ministers have it
in the back of their heads to swap one im-
ported person for another, they had better
take the idea out and throw it away. With-
out going afield, N. S. Wales has some very
excellent railway specialists who might fre-
ouently be consulted with great advantage.
The trouble with Johnson is that he is a
self-sufficient specialist in everything under
the sun, so the really valuable knowledge of
these other officers is wasted.
Another eminent scientist has arisen to
tell us the Northern Territory is no good
and cannot be settl 'd bv white men. He is
one J. T. Ramsay, who was sent in the be-
ginning of last year to turn a tract of
something like 2500 acres of uncleared
scrub on the Daly River into an Experi-
mental Farm. Say’s he :
It is hard to get away from the effects of the
climate. The shade heat in summer did not go
higher than 102°, and in winter it ranged from 85°
to 90°. But the excessive humidity and the daily
repetition of the trying heat brings on insomnia, so
that it is very hard to keep going.
Ramsay was ill-advised to buttress his idio-
tic opinions with figures. A temperature
of 102° is nothing to whine about, no
matter how humid the conditions. And
this is given as an approximate maximum
on the Daly River. The maximum winter
emperature of 90° is comparatively cool.
Yet Ramsay winds up this way—
I do not consider a man up there is capable of
doing more than 50 per cent, of the labor than he
could do in a temperate zone in the same length of
time. I make a similar estimate in regard to horses.
Farming is bound to be very expensive there—the
conditions of labor are so severe.
It is a most lamentable example of the way
a partisan, falls in when he bolts, contro-
versially speaking, and recklessly overstates
his case.
From a press interview with Speaker
Henry Willis (N.S.W.) in Maoriland: —
I am sorry to say that very recently an incident
occurred which was somewhat startling, to say the
least of it. It was brought under my notice that
the Inspector-General of Police was invited by a
Minister of the Crown to send a posse of police to
secrete themselves about Parliament House for the
purpose of suppressing
the riot that was be-
lieved by the Ministry
to be imminent. It ap-
pears that my actions
in the chair had given
the impression to t h e
leaders of the Opposi-
tion that I was forc-
ing a dissolution, and
in order to prevent
such a thing from
eventuating 60 m e ru-
bers had signed a
round robin agreeing
among themselves to
drag me from the chair
if I took any action
that would have pre-
cipitated a dissolution.
This came to me as a
great surprise, and it
will give some little
idea of the state of de-
... . , pravity that the Oppo-
sition has arrived at in the Parliament of New South
Wales.
But where was the necessity to drag Henry
forth by physical violence if 60 out of 90
members in the Assembly, decided he should
go? Did the comnositor muddle up the
wonderful interview?
Justice Hodges, of Victoria, sitting as a
Commission to inquire into the accusations
made against Chinn, the man in charge of
construction on the transcontinental rail-
way, closed the matter with a bang and a
crash and a considerable brown howl. Re
the suggestion that some of Chinn’s testi-
monials were bogus (Chinn’s story was
that he had lost or destroyed the originals
and preserved only copies, and his accusers’
story was that there had never been any
originals), fhe verdict was one of “not
proven.” That was the bang. The crash
came in where the Judge found the other
four charges absolutely baseless. And the
brown howl arrived when the Court went
out of its way to draw attention to the im-
probability of the tale told by Hedges, M.P.,
about how Chinn had tried to sell him
SOOOoz. of gold (presumably stolen) at £2
an ounce. The Court took a depressed view
of the narrative of Hedges, M.P., and didn’t
hesitate to say so.
Vic. Premier Watt’s reconstruction of his
Cabinet boils down to the admission of
Peacock as Minister for Education and
Labor. Weary continues as Chief Sec., or
Chief Sleeper, and becomes Acting-Premier;
and Billson, who likes his imported goods
made in Germany, returns to the Railways
job and takes up Mcßride’s Mines and
Forests billets. The whole futile jugglemcnt
really constitutes a loud yell for elective
Ministries. There are in the present Vic-
THE FUSION—UNDER FREETRADE
MANAGEMENT.
TORY PRESS: “ Ain't it a beautiful match, and
don't they agree pujfckly!”
AUSTRALIA: “But what about the tariff?"
TORY P RESS: “ They’ve agreed never to men-
tion it!"
torian Assembly practically only two men
competent to act as Railways Minister—and
neither of them is Billson ; there is but one
man with progressive ideas on a policy of
afforestation conservation of existing
forests —and he sits in Opposition; there
are men in both Houses who are sound law-
yers, with their heads screwed on —but none
of them is Attorney-General J. Dry. Brown ;
and almost any man with the energy of a
sloth would make a better Chief. Sec. than
John Weary. But the party system has in-
flicted these disasters, and so long as that
system obtains, they can only be shifted by
a coalition that will give an even more futile
combination.
THE WAY OF THE WORLD.
The Government had done more to stir up ill-
feeling between classes than any other Administra-
tion The Labor party were the Tories of to-day,
because they were fighting for privileges, not for the
King—for an aristocracy of their own in the Trades
HalL . . .The time was coming when the people would
rise and sweep those men off the country. (Loud
cheers.) —Bruce Smith,
The Deposed One: “ A-ha! You-you Tory
tyrant! Your time will come ! ”
The Usurper (loftily): “Behave yourself ;
you anarchist! ”
Massey, Premier of Maoriland, says that
he has it on the authority of -a gentleman
whose name is esteemed in London financial
circles that the credit of the Shaky Archipel-
ago has “gone up enormouslv.” This may be
true, but its stocks are quoted lower than
they were before Massey took office, and
what makes the case worse, they are lower
than similar stocks of Australian States,
bad as these may be. Massey’s one hope of
doing something better than those who went
before him was to shy off the foreign money-
pots, and cease worrying about credit in the
IO U market. But to all anoearance he is
out to mortgage the future some more, and
regards Cohen as the chariots of Maoriland
and the horsemen thereof.
“Apple-Islander” speaks:—
Now that the dust raised by the Tasmanian elec
tions is beginning to settle, the absurdity of the nosi
tion is more clearly seen than ever. The partied
stand 16 to 14, and as a Speaker must be chosen
from the bigger crowd, their actual fighting strenciß
will be 15 to 14. Yet the members elected retire
sent as accurately as possible the real opinion of th
Tasmanian voters, and the relative strength of parties
is a direct reflection of the popular will. Under the
Hare system there is proper minority representation 6
and everything is as fair as it can be made. The
Liberals of the State polled 35,000 votes; the Labor
party 31,000. The political deadlock is, therefore
a real deadlock of opinion throughout the State and
cannot in any fair or
reasonable way be
got over. But things
are likely to be worse
before they are bet
ter. Lewis, ex-Pre
mier of the State,
will probably g 0 to
the Supreme Court
Bench and leave a
vacancy in the Deni-
so n electorate. I f
Labor collars the seat
- and at a by-elec-
tion it may easily do
so —the voting power
of the parties will be
as 15 to 15. Then
some person of bril-
liant originality and
initiative will suggest
another general elec-
tion, and everything
will be done over
again to secure the
same result. And yet
there is no earthly
reason why Tas-
mania shouldn’t get
.. . , . , . ~ on with its business
it only certain absurd notions about party were
thrown away. Party government in the Apple Island
has failed, and it is up to the people to demand an
Elective Ministry, a Referendum with Initiative and
a period of solid Parliamentary work from those’ whn
are paid to do it.
Melb Argus urges that the States should
adopt uniform Game laws. Says the Tory
sheet:—
The fact that wild duck shot in New South Wales
can be exposed for sale anywhere in Melbourne dur-
ing the close season stultifies the efforts of Victoria
to suppress the evil [of promiscuous shooting], and
the fact that the two States cannot agree upon a
common policy is discreditable.
Of course it is. And does the Argus re-
member something about a Referendum,
whose object was to secure uniformity with
regard to such matters as trade, commerce
and industry? Commerce includes the sale
of wild ducks.
“Q.R.”: N.S.W. Labor Government
hasn’t so far filled up the hole in the
Cabinet occasioned by the deflection of
Beeby. A cqjtple of weeks back that genial
old soul, Alf Edden, was left to administer
the portfolios of Mines, Ag-
riculture, Lands and Edu-
cation. And. with all respect
to Alfred, this was making a
farce of the thing; There
are two reasons generally
given for the position. One
is that a strong clique in the
Caucus insists on Dick
Meagher being lifted into the
Ministry, hut that the Gov-
ernment is dubious as to how
the country would stand
that; the other is that
the salary saved is wanted
for party purposes. The
second reason is. of course,
absurd. The Government is
not paid a lump sum to
divide up amongst its mem-
bers. Appointed Ministers receive then-
cheques the same as appointed clerks. No
Minister, no cheque.
The Mayor of Brighton (Melh.) com-
plained that Premier Watt’s style of re-
ceiving a deputation of local councillors
denoted “the swollen head and the vulgar
mind.” Willy Watt, on the other hand,
alleges that the worshipful gentleman’s re-
marks are quite characteristic of him, and
neople who have not met the Mayor of
Brighton are wondering whether he is a
worthy successor to old Tom Bent, who ruled
the council for many, many years, and set
the standard of its manners.
HEAVEN INTERVENES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Home Rule is almost an accomplished fact; but
I have no doubt Heaven will intervene, and our
brethren in Ulster will be saved.”— Grandmaster
Batley, at a Melbourne Orange shivoo.
The Irish, sick of foreign sway,
In Ireland seek to rule, they say—
A shameful aspiration!
They wish to work in their own way
Their hapless land’s salvation.
Their triumph, too, may soon be seen,
If Heaven do not intervene.
So men of Ulster, wake, arise,
And arm with stones of goodly size,
Put on your knuckle-dusters!
All loyal be. List to the wise
Where Carson raves and blusters,
For Orange may succumb to Green
If Heaven do not intervene.
Go, gather shot and shell in tons,
And load with ball the deadly guns!
Those Irishmen must perish
Who Irish laws for Irish sons
On Irish shores would cherish;
Have swords well sharpened, axes keen,
And Heaven soon will intervene.
When Orange leaders bid you strike,
Swing high the club, drive home the pike ;
And when the foe are shattered,
And lie upon the verdue like
The red bloom God has scattered,
Give praise in thankfulness serene
That Heaven chose to intervene!
victoria.
EDDYSON.
LOGIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Argus, arguing excitedly against anv idea of
tampering with the tariff,” declares a revision to
be wholly unnecessary, and to prove it quotes from
the last bulletin dealing with the manufacturing
industries, which sets, down the value of output for
1911 at £133,186,560, as against £87,057,165 for
1907. “The table furnishes a record of remarkable
and entirely unexampled progress,” says the Argus.
Consequently, many industries having prospered
under Protection, it is inadvisable to give Protec-
tion to those industries that are not prospering.
Poor Smith lay very ill indeed.
The harried doctors stood about.
Old Freetrade thought that they should bleed
The sufferer, who without a doubt
Was much too strong and much too stout.
The stricken man was thin and pale,
And lacked nutrition, so they said:
“If we his sustenance curtail
He’ll very soon be stout and hale.”
They did, and Smith was nearly dead.
Then Doc. Protection brought a fat,
Iligh-tariff phial. With a frown
Nurse Aygus yelled: “Jehosaphat!
You musn’t give the patient that.
Why, that’s the stuff that cured poor Brown.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Trumper benefit match brought to-
gether a crowd of representative bats and bowlers
from the three leading States; which gave the game
something more than the interest of an inter-State fix-
ture. M. A. Noble came out of his semi-retirement
for the occasion, and the gathering of cracks, new
and old, to do honor to Australia’s greatest cricketer
was something worth going far to see. The chief
interest on the first day, however, centred in the play
of three colts who have in them the making of great
batsmen. Clem Hill won the toss, and the “Rest
of Australia” went in to bat on ground which was
rapidly recovering from the rain of the night before.
Mayne and Campbell went to the wickets and faced
the bowling of Massie and Hordern. At 31 Campbell
jumped out to drive the Doctor, and was clean-
bowled for 14. Clem Hill came in and played
clumsy cricket, being badly missed when he had made
18 by Collins at extra mid-on. Mavne got to 40
and was caught and bowled smartly by Hazlitt.
Armstrong followed, made a single, and was bowled
off his pad. Then followed Hansford, who made
38, and Moyes, who, beginning cautiously, was soon
playing fine, free cricket. Hill was bowled by
Massie when he had made 66. Several changes of
bowling were tried, and Noble got a great round of
applause when he took the ball. He did not do
much with it, however, though Crawford, lifting one
of his balls to Bardsley, was out for a fowl. Then
Cody, the N.S.W. colt, who was filling a gap in the
combined team, partnered Moyes, and the prettiest
play of the day was seen. Moyes did all the run-
getting worth mentioning, but Cody played soundly,
with a defence that was invulnerable against the
most dangerous-looking bowling. When Moyes had
been in 109 minutes for 76, he was clean bowled by
Macartney. Ryder, another colt, followed, and when
the score was 308 Cody went out on a charge of
hoof in front of wicket. He had made 42 in 109
minutes —exactly the time it took Moyes to compile
76. Ryder showed fine form and carried his score
to 38. To the three colts —Moyes, Cody and Ryder—
belonged the chief honors of the day.
After a night and morning of rain Barbour and
Kelleway went in to bat for N.S.W.. and Kellewav
returned with a round figure against his name,
caught off the second ball. Macartney followed, and
on the sodden wicket began to score rapidly. Bar-
bour kept his end up, and presently the infection of
run getting caught him also, and the two lifted the
score merrily to 138. Then Macartney was caught
by Mayne at point, having battered up 91 in 100
minutes, on a bowler’s wicket. It was a fine per-
formance, and suggests that Macartney is the best
batsman playing at the present moment in Aus-
tralia. Trumper came in amid tremendous cheering,
hut Barbour continued to do most of the scoring.
The latter reached 86 —made in 143 minutes. At
5.20 the rain, which had threatened all the after-
noon, began to fall steadily, and, as the light was
bad, stumps were drawn and the mud-picnic aban-
doned for the day. There were 13,000 people present
during the afternoon.
On Monday Trumper continued his innings to 126.
not out, but, with the exception of Noble, he could
find nobody in the N.S.W. team to stav with him.
Noble knocked.up 46 ; but Collins, who followed him,
did not survive the first ball. In auick succession
five men were caught off Rvder’s bowling, and Massie
getting l.b.w. to Crawford, the innings was at an
end. The collapse was sudden and unexpected, the
last five wickets adding onlv 39. Ryder’s figures for
the innings stood at five wickets for 66 runs, but 52
of those runs had been made on Saturday, and his
actual performance for the afternoon was five for 14.
Trumper’s score included 16 fours, and. although he
was nearly three hours compiling his runs, and
showed little of his usual brilliancy of form, very
little real fault could be found with his play. On the
first innings N.S.W. led by 31.
Heavy rain on Monday mght and Tuesday morning
prevented the game being plaved to a finish ; but the
purpose of the match had been achieved, and, in-
cluding gate, donations and sale of souvenirs, the
Trumper benefit fund stood on Monday evening at
the decent total of over #2500. It is almost half as
much as a first-class fighting man would earn in
an hour of bash and cuddle.
* * * *
On Saturday, at Trumper’s testimonial
match, the “Sunshine” comedy girls who were to
carry round the collection boxes failed to materialise,
so Mary Ann Noble called for volunteers from the
N.S.W. team, and with them bailed up the crowd
with considerable success. Carter’s methods were
refreshingly simple. He was given the members’
stand, and he used to wait opposite each man until
he paid som'ething. Argument was useless. Carter
just waited, and cheers from those around did the
rest. If any one man hadn’t paid Carter would,
presumably, be standing there yet. iThe team sold
over 1000 photos of the flannelled hero of the day.
Matthews, the small Victorian batsman,
was sent in eighth against N.S.W. in the recent
inter-State match. He made 71 and saved the side
from collapse. In the second innings he made 81
(top score), again going in eighth. As a token of
recognition, Clem Hill, in the Trumper Test, sent him
in tenth, and he had only time to knock up 18 not
out before the other wicket fell and the side was
out. It was a great piece of strategy, or some such
animal.
* * * *
Victor Trumper’s records make astonish-
ing reading when they are massed together. W. G.
Grace performed with bat and ball over a longer
period, but it is very much to be questioned .whether
the standard of English cricket in Grace’s earlier
county days was anything like as high as that of
Australia’s” in 1894,” when Trumper first began to
play in big cricket. In Sydney Grade cricket, the
man over whom enthusiastic crowds have been yell-
ing themselves hoarse, has an average per innings
from 1896 to last year of 73.55. In 1897-98 that
average was actually 204.20, and the lowest that it
has reached for any season since that date is 47.09.
In 74 innings for Australia against England, his
average was 32.79, and in 20 innings for N.S.W.
against England 46.65. In four tours in England, he
averaged for 197 innings 38.09; in the South
African tour of 1902 his average was 47.80; and
during his single visit to Maoriland he had an aver-
age of 128. Playing for Australia against South
Africa on Australian soil, he averaged 75 for 16
innings ; and against the State his biggest scores in
chronological order were: 292*, 253, 300*, 208, 230,
218*, 214*, 201*. Some of these big figures were
knocked up against teams like Maoriland and Trans-
vaal, but the biggest score of all was made against
a first-elates English county. Trumper has done some
brave things with the ball besides knocking it to
the boundary. In 1892 —the wet' English season dur-
ing which he scored 2570 runs —he took five Cam-
bridge wickets at a cost of 19 runs. Take him all
in all, his brilliant fielding, his wizardry with the
bat and his long continuance in the very front rank
of players, Australia will find it hard to rear any-
one to matcn him. Macartney is, perhaps, for the
moment his equal in brilliancy, but he has a long
way to go before he can show the rows of mighty
figures that stand in the name of Victor Trumper.
The beautiful weather of Saturday appar-
ently nerved Melbourne’s “flannelled fools” to do
something to interest the languid persons who haunt
the pavilions during club matches. St. Kilda, hav-
ing 309 on the board for four wickets, raised its
tally to 321 and declared. This left North with
the stupendous task of reaching a similar total in less
than 31 hours. The last wicket fell at 5.30, and St.
Kilda had carried off the honors with 123 runs to
spare. ’Varsity for a time looked as though it
wouldn’t Essendon’s trifling score of 172, but
the reliable Hartkopf put a new countenance on
matters, and, with 91 n.o. by himself, and mild
assistance from a few mates, put 236 on the board
for eight wickets. Then the skipper “closed,” with
the manifest intention of rushing the ’Dons through
a second time, but found the contract too lengthy
for the minutes available. ’Roy likewise found the
easy job of matching Carlton’s 173 as much as it
could manage, and six wickets fell before the neces-
sary runs were made. East, with a disgraceful 121
to its first innings’ credit, sprinted hopelessly round
the ground, while P’ran piled up a comparative
mountain of 282 for two wickets. Healy, 144, not
out. This awful walloping absolutely demolishes
East’s pennant hopes for the season. Richmond,
with eight wickets down for 255, lost another in
reaching 289, then closed—and struck trouble.
South had got over the effects of its Maoriland tour
and was in good fettle. Before South’s first wicket
fell 95 runs were on the board, and Richmond began
to feel poorly. The batsmen following took all the
risks they could, and “hang the consequences,” and
presently the fieldsmen were praying earnestly either
for six o’clock or a sudden accession of skill on the
part of the bowlers. The prayers were partially an-
swered, and the time arrived for drawing stunros
with seven wickets down and 232 to South’s credit.
It wasn’t the great finish that it might have been.
“E.W.H.”: While the 12,000 were wildly
worshipping at the shrine of Trumper on Saturday,
nearly 800 riflemen were busy on the 72 targets at
the Randwick rifle range. The musketry course at the
end of the quarter was under way, and the lads were
qualifying for efficiency in the defence of their
country. Possibly the work they put in at the butts
was worth more than all the racket at the Cricket
Ground. It was a case of sport v. my country, and the
smaller band deserved to gather the glory and the
halos.

It was recently suggested in The Bulle-
tin that Mambray Star, the S.A. horse that ran two
races within 40 minutes, and won the second, must
be “a glutton for work.” He is. At Snowtown
(S.A.), last week, he started in the first, third and
fifth races, and won the lot.
* * * *
The early fall of Easter this year was
expected to induce large entries of Sydney horses
for the autumn carnival at Caulfield and Flemington.
They could have been just about ready for the New-
market and Australian Cup, and not too ripe for the
Doncaster and Sydney Cun a fortnight later. But
the N.S.W. contingent at the two Melbourne meetings
will not be numerous, anyhow. It looks dangerous,
though. Of the few that crossed the Murray last
week, Piastre, Cider and Popinjay are pretty certain
to pay for the journey, and there are others. Vic-
torian fancies for the double —Newmarket and Aus-
tralian^ —are very half-hearted thus far. A popular
tip for the long race is The Parisian, if he doesn’t
break down before the day, and the “if” is a very
serious consideration in the case of this aged hero.
* ■* * *
The average “class” of English-bred
racers, as compared with Australian ditto, should be
tested this next year or two, as it never was tested
before. A. E. Cockram, late of Westralia, and now
of Victoria, imported a crowd of 22 English year-
lings, two-year-olds and three-year-olds to Mel-
bourne last week, and in the matter of pedigree
these are calculated to show Cold Country “form”
at its best. The three-year-old colt Collared,
for instance, won five races and was five
times placed last year on his native turf.
He is a half-brother to Sceptre, the famous mare
that won a fortune for Bob Sievier some years ago.
Chrysippus is another three-year-old aristocrat with a
reputation as a galloper. A handsome daughter of
old Carbine, and several offspring of various top-
notch performers of more recent date were included
in the shipment.
* * * *
Saturday (15th) is the first of the meet-
ing at Caulfield, which serves as curtain raiser to the
\ . It.C. Autumn fixture. Up to last week there had
born litle or no talk of “dead birds” for the Oak-
-1 igh Plate, so it will probably be a “good betting
race” (from Moses’s point of view) on the day, and
the winner is not unlikely to prove one more disap-
pointing first favorite for the Newmarket, due a
fortnight later. At present the Oakleigh Plate looks
a bad race to gamble on, whereas the rich Futurity
Stakes, run on the 22nd, presents one or two strong
inducements for a flutter.
* * * *
On Friday and Saturday of last week the
New South Wales Challenger, Rawhiti 11., carried
off the Northcote Cup by winning the first and
second heats of the race from the Victorian de-
fender, Killara. In both heats the handling of the
Sydney boat and her increased sail area gave her a
distinct advantage. Weather conditions on both days
were similar —a strong S.W. breeze with a choppy
sea. On Friday the course was three miles to wind-
ward and return twice round, and Rawhiti 11., hav-
ing a slight advantage nearly all the way, won by
lmin. 37sec. Saturday’s course was a square, of
which each side made lj miles, and the race was
again twice round. Killara lost H minutes at the
start through coming up on the wrong side of the
buoy, and having to go back and make a fresh dive.
Rawhiti 11. soon increased this lead, and stepping
out faster all the way led by Smin. 27sec. at the
end of the first lap. In the second Spell Killara did
better, but still continued to lose ground to her
speedier rival, and when the challenger crossed the
line at five o’clock the Victorian boat was a mile
and a half away. E. Sayer attributed his victory to
his having spent a fortnight getting local knowledge.
Rawhiti 11. proved her superiority most in the rough
water, and went bowling along through the spray
with her crew soaked and half drowned, but alert
enough to bring their ship home to safety amid the
cheers of the crowd on St. Kilda pier.
* * * •
In spite of the sportive south wind and
the prospect of rain, there was practically a full
muster of craft at the starting line for Saturday’s
sailing events in Port Jackson. White Wings won
the Thelma Cup, with Culwulla 111. second and
Sayonara third. The course was from Neutral Bay,
round a mark about a mile east of Deewhy Head, and
round Shark Island back to the finishing line. Out-
side the Heads things were tolerably rough, and
Horace Muston, who handled the winner, brought
his craft along finely in the thrash back from the
turning point in the teeth of the wind. Thelma who
was the fourth starter, made a rather poor showing,
and did not complete the course. Sayonara had her
topsail sheet carried away on the return journey
outside the Heads. Thelma led to the North Head,
where Culwulla 111. passed her, and at Deewhy the
same order was preserved, with White Wings sailing
third. Coming up to windward White Wings and
Sayonara performed best. Culwulla 111. was the
first into the harbor, and led all the way to the
finishing line, but failed to make up the 12 minutes’
handicap which she had to concede to White Wings.
In the eight metres’ class race there were only two
competitors—Yeulba and Petrel. They were on the
same mark, and after some boggling at the start
Yeulba led to Lang’s Point. Here Petrel, with top-
sail and spinnaker set, passed her, and was the first
out to sea. Beyond the Heads Yeulba gave up the
attempt, and Petrel made the rest of the journey
alone. The little craft was finely handled, and made
better time outside the harbor than Sayonara and
White Wings.
* * * *
The hydroplane is an uncertain craft, and
the fact that Peerless, the scratch boat, owned by
Mr. T. J. Moncks, did not put in an appearance at
Rose Bay on Saturday, to show whether she had the
swift legs to deserve a match against Kangaroo for
the speed pennant of the club, was nothing out of
the usual. This time her engineer was ill, but if he
hadn’t been ill the owner’s aunt might have been
suffering from headache, or the bottom might have
accidentally fallen out of the boat, or the engine
might have been dead. In any case, the odds against
her turning up would have been considerable. The
general handicap, in which Peerless should have
bounded over the water like a touch of • imagination
flying before a sub-editorial devil, resulted in a win
for Aiglon, with Monette in second place.
The Enterprise (Sydney) Club’s second
annual regatta was damped by plenty of rain, but
the cooling showers seemed to suit the oarmen, and
did nothing to damp the enthusiasm of the on-
lookers. The Senior Fours brought out two com-
petitors—Balmain and Enterprise. Balmain, as pre-
miers and leaders in the competition, were favorites,
but their opponents led all the way and won a splen-
did race by the narrow margin of 6ft., which is one
horizontal fathom. H. Green stroked the winning
boat. In the Single Sculls, W. Carter (Enterprise),
25sec., won by three lengths, with S. Grant (Bal-
main), 15sec., second, and H. Green (Enterprise),
scratch, third. The race was a splendid effort on the
part of the scratch man to overhaul those handi-
capped in front of him, but they maintained their
lead to the finish. In the competition points Bal-
main has now so small an advantage that the St.
Ignatius Regatta, where the champion eights are
rowed, will be the final test between that club and
Enterprise.

Harry Pearce, who leaves Sydney by the
Gothic, is supposed to have improved out of sight
since his last meeting with Dick Arnst. Pearce is
certainly the best sculler Australia has produced for
a long time, and there is no one more worthy to
disturb the ancient and muddy waters of the Thames
in her name. Neil Matterson, who once held the
English championship, declares that the Thames
course is not the awful calamity it has been declared
to be, but one of the best waters of decision in the
world. Anyhow, Pearce has all the waterman’s craft
that Arnst lacked, and he has' a lot more than a
sporting chance of defeating Barry. If he does, and
Arnst comes into the game again, with Alf Felton
and Jim Paddon also keen for championship glory,
there should be a big sculling revival in this part of
the world.
* * ♦ *
The controversy between Frank Picato
and Jean Poesy, at Sydney Stadium, was not the
stirring and hard-fought thing that some people ex-
pected it to be. The handsome French boy looked
warm and uncomfortable almost from the start, and
the lily-white complexion which he wears habitually
was soon streaked and blotched with artificial pink.
The Italian-American, with his fixed look of sorrow
and cheerless nose, presented his cheek to the smiter
and allowed Poesy to land quite a respectable num-
ber of touches on various parts of his countenance,
but when it came to real wallops, he took a turn
and knocked his opponent Clean out of the ring. At
the end of the first round Poesy was sitting down
waiting for the bell. The second round was a cheer-
ful business of mixed punches. One delivered by
Picato looked as if it might have lifted the roof off
the Stadium if it could have got as high, but for-
tunately there was nothing in the road. Then the
Dago-American hit Poesy in the face, and the latter
retired gracefully to the ropes, where he stood in
an attitude of pleased expectancy while Picato hit
him some more. After that the Frenchman sat down,
or knelt down, or something, and a moment later
lay down. The referee counted him out, the audience
made unpleasant noises, and the business of the even-
ing was over. Only once did Poesy look like troub-
ling his opponent, and that was when he tried to
break through Picato’s ribs at close range. Never
at any time did the contest look dangerous, or even
too strenuous for a drawing-room entertainment. A
very few fights like the Poesy-Picato engagement,
with its sudden and painless ending, would rob the
Sydney Stadium of a lot of its popularity. It should
be up to the management to arrange for a few exhi-
bition bouts or something of the kind to fill out
time, and give the crowd what it is looking for.
Theatre patrons complain of the short three-act. play
with the long intervals, and begin to demand a
curtain-raiser. What is to be said for a show with
a maximum charge of 10s. which lasts about four
minutes ?
* * * *
It would be difficult to say whether .Tean
Audouy was more scared of Pat Bradley or Pat Brad-
ley of Jean Audouy when they met last week at Syd-
ney Stadium. Although their weights were equal,
Bradley looked the stronger and thicker of the
two, and he carried a smile throughout the contest
which got more and more sickly as the rounds passed.
Audouy, on the other hand, carried scare in his eyes
even when he was scoring best. The fight might be
best described as an effort on the part of a very
frightened person to overcome by sheer strength an-
other very frightened person, who was an exceed-
ingly clever boxer. From the opening round Bradley
had the crowd against him for his attempts to push
his man about the ring and wear him out by any
sort of means except plain stoush. The Frenchman,
however, more than held his own, and round after
round was distinctly in his favor until the 16th go
was reached, when Bradley began pushing and bash-
ing like a person possessed by a whole legion of en-
thusiastic devils. Still, on points, the game was all
Audouy’s, and there seemed no good reason why he
should not stay to the end and win. Audouy him-
self, however, had different ideas on the subject, and
was evidently afraid that if the thing continued
somebody might get hurt. In the middle of the
17th round he extended the loving fist of surrender
to his opponent, and retired to his corner licked
The ending was rather tame and French—or what
Stadium crowds have come with some reason to re-
gard as French —but Dr. Dawson afterwards exam-
ined the vanquished, and discovered that both his
hands were fractured. Bradley may thus be said to
have won through , the fist-shattering hardness of his
skull and his remarkable ability to butt, bore, maul
and push without crossing the limit which ’would
earn disqualification. Considered as a fight the
thing wasn’t much, and as a boxing contest it was
less, but as an exhibition of high-class and strenuous
cuddling it has seldom been equalled in Sydney.
N.S.W. Rugby League took a narrow view
of its organisation when it resolved that no
further teams should be added to the Svd-
ney First Grade list for the coming season. At
present the League clubs are bursting with members
who are fit for higher honors; but the League game
only allows 13 Players in a team, and the others
must wait for unlikely opportunities, or get out and
play ping-pong or something. But, while the League
wHI allow no more clubs in the competition, it is
grabbing more playing spaces, and the new hauls in-
e S y dney Cricket Ground and Drummoyne Oval •
while the North Sydney area is handed to it on agree-
ment to pay 20 per cent, of the gross gate receipts.
N.S.W. Football League (Australian
Rules) has started on a sensible path by deciding
that the “district” scheme shall henceforth govern iis
particular brand of competition football in Sydney
Ten clubs are allowed for in the kick-off of the comine
winter struggle—enough for a start. Y.M.C.A. and
Railway clubs go out; and the Good Young Men
must join in the rushes of the heathen, or forsake the
game. All brands, colors and descriptions of hoof
ball are now working under the “district” scheme'
and the loose club system is burst, broken and gone
to smithereens.

Saturday night saw the opening of the
Australian swimming championships at the Sandv
Bay baths, Hobart. Longworth (N.S.W.) won the
880yds. by 30yds. from S. Smith (N.S.W.), and
W. F. Springfield (Q.). W. Finney (W.A.), the
holder of the title, won the 100yds. breast stroke
Ted Wickham (N.S.W.) got away badly at the start
and failed to make the champion sprint as hard for
his honors as he would otherwise have done. A
100yds. open handicap was annexed by E. Johnson
(S.A.) ; and in the open diving competition C.
Mills (Tas.) scored first place, with J. Baker
(N.S.W.) second.

Two South Australian motor cyclists,
C. W. A. Korner and T. B. Ragless, have recently
made unsuccessful attempts to put up extra fast runs
between Adelaide and Melbourne. Ragless got to
Hamilton, 389 miles from Adelaide, in 204 hours,
and then worry over the magneto and trouble about
tyres brought the journey to an end. His riding
time to Mount Gambier (303 miles) was 15 hours.
Both riders are of opinion that it is a long ride and
a hard one; but now that the Dunlop people have
offered a 20-guinea gold watch for the first to break
24 hours over the 574 miles between city and city,
there are likely to be some properly organised
attempts at the big task. The prize is open only to
members of inter-State motor-cycle clubs, and times
must be officially checked.
* * * *
E. Tyler, who made the recent unsuccess-
ful attack on the Sydney-Melbourne motor-cycle re-
cord, seems to have broken the record for bad luck
on the way. Through taking the wrong road at
Campbelltown he was thrown into a deep ditch: be-
tween Picton and Mittagong the bush on both sides
of the road was ablaze; and when he reached Goul-
burn he was 34 hours behind time. Despite further
falls, bad roads and a broken footrest, which took 10
minutes to adjust, Tyler reached Seymour (Vic.)
in such good time that the shattering of the record
looked a sure thing. To equal Gunn’s time he had
only to cover 62 miles in three hours and 20
minutes. Easy as the task seemed, he failed to ac-
complish it. Every blessed evil which could affect a
machine started to get in its fine work, and the only
things that stood to Tyler right through were the
Continental tyres on his 34-h.p. Rover. The last 37
miles of the journey were done in a motor-car.

Australian motor cyclist S. L. Bailey has
been shaking things up at Brooklands (England).
Riding a 2f-h.p. machine, he climbed, shot or stag-
gered over a flying kilometer (1093 yards) at the
rate of 724 miles an hour, and over a mile at the
rate of 70 miles an hour. This is phenomenal going
for a light-weight machine, and a striking feature of
the exploit was that the Douglas cycle used was only
geared five to one, so that the engine must have been
actually working 4650 revolutions per minute.
Mrs. Pankhurst has got the British legis-
lator in a new place. Sticking hatpins in him only
roused him to a finer display of stolid calm. Break-
ing windows in the street, and burning the letters
of the general public in the pillar boxes did not
touch him morp intimately than the war in the
Balkans, or the defeat of a white hope bv something
large and black in the Sydney Stadium. But the
lady who waves the chief brolly of women’s suffrage
was not to be turned from her purpose. A vital blow
must be struck, and the tenderest spot with the
front bench politician was his golf green. Conse-
quently the golf greens of the Cold Country are now
getting it, and the shopkeepers and post-office
people have a moment’s respite.
A Sydney sporting writer of great tonnage
advises the large black persons who have so fre-
quently fought one another in Australia, and who
have mopped up all the white stoush available, to
get away as quickly as possible to France. It is
said that there is neither color line nor color preju-
dice there. This is probably true, unless the pro-
posal of some French officers to import a West
African nigger army creates one. In any case all the
signs of the times point to the fact that Johnsing
has about finished the chances of black gladiators to
rake in dollars in America, and that the same spirit
is likely to grow and increase among white men
everywhere. Snowy Baker is looking for a white
hope, but nobody is likely to lose any sleep if he
should fail to find the article.

The motorist gets a new tyre, and the
betting is about 10 to one on that before he finishes
his first run he will have to paddle over a bit of new
road —a patch that hasn’t been either “blinded” or
rolled. The result is invariably a choice collection
of little cuts, the nucleus of big troubles. The
Michelin people have lately produced a mastic, which
is being verv well spoken of for use in such emer-
gencies. The cut should be thoroughly cleaned
(with petrol, preferably), and then treated to a coat
of solution; finally, the mastic should be kneaded
and worked in to completely fill the cut. The stuff
takes about five or six hours to set.


A CLEAN, DECISIVE BLOW
-STRAIGHT TO THE POINT-
is the most convincing way you can assert yourself in a “rough up.” You can’t be sure for five
minutes ahead that you’ll not be forced into such a position as demands a personal encounter. But
don’t resort to that extreme unless it is inevitable.
The fact of your knowing how to box will greatly lessen the chances of your being drawn into
a brawl. Boxing instils self-confidence and coolness, and those traits inspire respect from a
possible adversary.
Boxing is a highly delightful pastime, that will enable you to spend many a pleasant hour.
And when you can learn right in your own home there’s no excuse for your not being a “snag.”
I TEACH BOXING BY POST.
You will quickly become a skilful boxer under my instruction. Pupils throughout Australia
are benefiting. Here is one report:—
“I had a spar with a big chap last week, and my hand seemed to work like a machine,
and he said after that he could not keep my left out of his face.”—J.S., Nambour (Q.)
Perhaps you’d like fuller information, fees, etc., and my handsomely illustrated 32-page descrip-
tive booklet. Write for it. I want to send it to every man who wants to learn Boxing. Kindly
forward three penny stamps for postage.

The Pain of Piles
It’s awful—insistent— irritating—distressing. .And, worst of
all if vou don’t make a decided effort towards banishm

From the price of fish in Melbourne, one
might deduce that all the fishermen were
dead; but the extraordinary performance
put up last week by a salted ancient of 70 is
a reminder that there are a few of them still
at it. The old chap, who lives at lonely
Werribee, went down to the beach in the
evening to have a look at a new, flat-bot-
tomed boat he had just bought. The punt
was partly afloat when he reached it, and, as
he stepped in, it slid away from the sand.
There was a stiff offshore breeze blowing,
and, in an astonishingly short space of time,
he was hundreds of yards out. There were
no sails or sculls in the craft, so he despair-
fully tried to manufacture rowlocks out of
his braces, and tore up two flooring boards
to use as paddles. He found the best he
could do with the makeshifts was to keep
the tub’s head to the sea. During the long
night, he drifted to within a couple of hun-
dred yards of distant Portarlington; then
the cranky wind changed and blew him back
freezingly the whole length «f the bay, so
that dawn discovered him off the Gellibrand
pile light. The light-keeper finally caught
him with a line, and, after being clothed,
fed and rested, the old hardy annual went
back to Werribee by train to catch more
fish. Apparently, any man of the sea who
has got used to carrying the Melbourne fish
retailer on his back looks upon such an ex-
perience as a bothersome interruption of
business, and no more.

Why does Odol absolutely supersede
all other preparations for cleansing
the mouth and teeth ?
Because of its remarkable power of
suffusing the entire oral cavity with
a thin but thoroughly effective anti-
septic coating which maintains its
protective influence for hours after
the mouth has been rinsed with it.
While tooth pastes and powders can, at the best, be
effective only during the few moments of application,
Odol continues to exert its antiseptic and refreshing
powers, gentlv but persistently, long after use.
It is this lasting effect that gives to daily users of Odol the
absolute assurance that their mouths are permanently protected
against the processes of fermentation and decomposition which,
if pot guarded against, inevitably destrov the teeth.
“J.N.”: William Samson, an aged and worthy Aus-
tralian, is at present trundling a barrow and giving
lantern exhibitions of Boer war pictures somewhere
between Chiltern (Vic.) and Inverell (N.S.W.). He
spent three years on a small farm at Chiltern with
his son. First year thev got a crop, second year
none, third year no hope of any. Then the old man
concluded that cockying was no good, and set out on
an 800-mile walk to the tin mines. I met him one
evening on the road with one boot off and one on, and
heard him discourse on Wellington, Napoleon and
other persons of fame, but could draw' no word from
him about his own troubles. Offered him a few bob,
but he declined them on the ground that he was now
nearly 80, and it was late to begin accepting charity.
He expects to reach Inverell about next Christmas.
Charles MacMahon, one of Australasia’s best-known
showmen, passed through Sydney the other day en
route to Britain on a business holiday, three-eighths
of it in the interests of his own health and plea-
sure ; and five-eighths in the interests of his far-
spread co. in Maoriland. It is about 15 years since
he visited the Cold Country, then as manager of
popular Johnny Sheridan. On his return to Aus-
tralia he brought out the Kinteseope, the mnv-
picture contraption which was the forerunner nf
present-flav elaborate flickergraph. n e S h o wa •
first in Sydney. ea
“J.F.E.” (from London) : G. R. Sims, caving
tribute to George Rignold in London RefL,
scribes him as a “fine, forceful, manly actor 5 l e ’
good old Victorian days of vigor.” Rignold scorJ he
couple of his biggest successes in two plays from *i. a
pen of Sims, “The Lights of London’* and “In
Ranks.” It was in “Twixt Axe and Crown ” a „1
by Tom Taylor, at the London Queen’s in 1870 th" V
he made what Sims regards as his first real hit ’“'n
handsome young actor was greeted with rintr M
cheers, and next morning all the newspapers
eloquent in his praise.”
“Lud”: An actress wrote to P.eerbohm Tree for
engagement. “Ready for anything, from Lady \fi n
beth to the charge of the retiring room.” n>
wrote back: “I have already a Lady Macbeth '
charge of the retiring room.” This reminds me 11
Beauchamp. He was a Melbourne actor who wem
off and became a Mormon elder. He came in th t
capacity to gather recruits in Melbourne. The n
pedition failing, he subsided into the job of Theatr.
Royal stage doorkeeper—before Captain Freeman’s
time. A once popular comedian is even now a Mel
bourne stage doorkeeper. Charley Burford was glad
to take a similar position in Sydney. He had been
Cassio on Brooke’s first Australian appearance at
Queen’s Theatre, Melbourne, and was Joseph Surface
in “The School for Scandal,” on the opening night
of the Melbourne Theatre Royal. A lady wh o
had held a good position had charge of the dress-
circle retiring room at the same house.
“Pro” : Wilson Barrett had a partner named Kellv
in the prosperous time of “The Lights o’ London”
“Romany Rye” and “The Silver King” at the Lon-
don Princess’s. Business fell off with “Hamlet"'
“Clito” was a frost ; and Bulwer’s posthumous
drama of “Junius Brutus” landed the firm in prac-
tical insolvency. In desperation Barrett put up
“Ben My Chree,” by Hal] Caine, then unknown as a
dramatic author. The first night had every appear-
ance of success. Barrett, highly elated, said to
Kelly: “There will be two columns in the Tele-
graph to-morrow by Clement Scott. We are in for
a twelve-months’ run. Watch for the queue outside
in the morning 1 It’s another ‘Silver King.’ ” But
Kelly was what pros, call a moaner. “No,” says
he, “this play is not Princess goods.” So he went
home depressed. However, he was in Oxford-street
betimes in the morning. Joy! There was the
queue! lie gave the cabby an extra shilling—and
then found that the queue was composed of credi-
tors, who had read the rapturous notices in the
papers, and were taking no risks.
From London: Presumably with Asche’s permis-
sion, a French version of “Kismet,” translated by
Jules Lemaitre, has been produced in Paris. Lucien
Guitry, who is generallv regarded as the greatest
living French actor, played .Oscar’s part of the
mendicant with a crowded career, and his sonorous
chant outside the mosque is said to have “positively
hypnotised the audience”—a remark that could not
be truly made about Oscar, who has never shone as a
vocalist and never will. The French “Kismet” has
been put on regardless of expense, everything being
gorgeous in the way of scenery and costumes. Also,
a number of genuine Arabs were brought from Asia
and Africa to impart local color and realism. A
journalist interviewed one of these real Orientals, and
asked him his candid opinion of the piece. The reply
was a gem of dramatic criticism: “Damn foolishness,
but makes money.”
“D.M.R.”: Re Australian artists who are making
good on Fogland boards (B. 23/l/’l3). Young Eric
Stone, a rising caricaturist, a la Levy, is appearing
at Glasgow: and Irene Dillon is playing principal
girl in pantomime at Leeds. The dainty ’Rene will
be remembered as one of Florrie Green’s star pupils,
who solo danced with Williamson and Co. during one
festive season. Somehow or other she is pretty often
described as an American. On the other hand, Mav
Beatty, who toured Australia and Maoriland with Ed-
ward Lauri, in “The Fortune Teller,” is billed as an
Australian —so that about balances it. Miss Dillon,
as a matter of fact, is the daughter of a gum expert
who practised at the top of Collins-street.
THE BIOSCOPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Williamson made a holiday trip through Europe
to Egypt, where he journeyed a considerable distance
up the Nile. In Egypt he made one discovery. “I
found,” he stated to-day, “that there was one town
w'here there was not a picture theatre. It was As-
souakin, a place with 12,000 inhabitants, and no
picture show.”
It waddles on its iron legs to countries near and far,
To Pennant Hills and Pimlico, to Bourke and Pesha-
war.
And Life from out its single eye,is blazed upon the
night,
Excepting at Assouakin —but that’s an oversight!
Full soon the dusky fellaheen —the Sheik in his bur-
noose,
And all the sweating sons of Ham will shake their
baksheesh loose,
For lo 1 the word is in the West and busy carriers
spin
A-winding miles of film to show at far Assouakin.
Assouakin’s a sleepy town and simple as it’s slow!
’Tis hard to catch a camel train or get the clocks»to
go !
And all the place can offer in the matter of a show
Are groups of carven figures aged a thousand years or
so.
Yet wait a while! For Sitting Bull and Broncho
Bill will mix
In grim, ferocious tragedy ; whilst Tontolini’s tricks
And Tweedledum and Tweedledee will raise a horrid
din,
And spoil all sweet contentment in remote Assouakin.
The youngsters of Assouakin—expressionless and
bland,
Bedecked with rooster feathers will play “Injuns” in
the sand.
The ladies of Assouakin, with roses in their hair,
Will yearn for wild adventure with a pictured million-
aire.
The fathers of Assouakin, long suffering the while,
Will have the chance of damning something else be-
sides the Nile.
And over all the multitude, like Cerberus will hang
Just one more plague of Egypt —the brazen Yankee
twang.

No notice (except of a hostile character) will be

and address must appear on MSS. No liability is
undertaken re contributions voluntarily submitted,
whether sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will
be returned unless stamps accompany.
C. A. Leonard: Supply answers to the
sample question suggested in The B. (30/l/’l3).
With pleasure: (1) The Trade Marks Act 1905 in-
sisted that a mark should be registered on all goods,
so that buyers might know whether the goods had
been manufactured under Union or other conditions.
This was declared unconstitutional by a majority of
the High Court (Griffith, C.J., and Justices Barton
and O’Connor), on the ground that it violated the
Trade and Commerce clause in the Constitution.
This clause, the fount and origin of all the political
litigation of recent years, says that “Parliament
5ha11.... have power to make laws... .with respect
to trade and commerce with other countries and
among the States.” The conservative section of the
Bench takes this to imply that the Commonwealth
is debarred (regardless of any other powers, however
explicitly granted to it) from legislating as regards
the internal affairs of any individual State. For
example, the Constitution expressly gives Parlia-
ment power to make laws in respect of “foreign cor-
porations and trading and financial corporations
formed within the lipiits of the Commonwealth.”
The High Court says that if the corporation is not
only within tlie limits of the Commonwealth, but
also within the limits of (say) Victoria, then the
explicitly given power is cancelled by the implied
disability. Justices Higgins and Isaacs interpret the
matter differently. In their view the right thing
for the High Court to do is to assume that the
different grants of power made to the Australian
Parliament in explicit terms, by the Constitution,
were intended to be used, and that they should not
be modified by any implied restraints whatever. But,
unfortunately, Higgins and Isaacs are only two, and
the others are three. (2a) The proceedings in Rex
v. Commonwealth Court of 'Conciliation and Arbitra-
tion ex parte Whybrow. (26) There are none.
(3a) Yes. (36) Unification need be no more of a
calamity in Australia than it Is in Britain. But
this paper advocates Unification and Reconstruction —
not mere Unification. (3c) There is no Trade and
Commerce clause in the British Constitution. The
House of Commons does not assail the commercial
rights of Yorkshire, and for the same reason the
Australian Parliament might be trusted not to assail
the commercial rights of N. S. Wales. The members
are neither criminals nor idiots. (4a) It was de-
cided in Appleton’s case, by the customary majority
of the High Court, that the implied power of the
States to deal exclusively with their own internal
trade and commerce deprived the Commonwealth of
any right to touch Trusts which had once begun
business. (46) One would do better on £3 10s.
per week in England than in the United States. The
proposition is too obvious to require argument. But
it is as difficult to get £3 10s. a week in England
as to get £7 a week in the States..... .J.S.: Scrappy
verses about a vague and footless horror. No name,
no address, no accurate description of vague and
footless horror. Consequently, . vague and footless
horror gone into basket. .. .W. Collins: If “Glenelg”
were all as good as the best of it, it would be
very good indeed ; and - if it were all as bad as the
worst of it, it would be too bad for polite lan-
guage. ... Searchlight: What has she done to you:—
THE MODERN GIRL.
Scrawny, in neck and sallow of face,
Large in the hat, ungainly in pace;
False in the bust, and padded at hips,
Hollow in head, and rouged on the lips—
She laughs and .cackles in merriment mad,
She’s everything silly, she makes me sad.
Note that you write from the big scrub, and say
you’ve been down to Sydney lately. How did you
prospect—with a hatpin or a harpoon ?... .D. Par-
nell: “Re war-horse supply, horses are a drug in the
market at present. There is a glut,” etc., etc. Well,
the man into whose hands your letter happened to
fall in the routine of this’office, bought a few last
week —light to medium draughts, mostly. For the
poorest the price was £36 ; for the best of a very
moderate lot, £45. And when the Railway Depart-
ment wanted a few horses for Newcastle lately, it
took McMahon about four months to scrape together
a mob that would pass the vets W.E.S.: Too
late; the subject is dead and buried, and not worth
a resurrection. .. .G.D.: Regret sketch unsuitable....

threepenny bar in Australia, and is slowly working
up to the sixpenny apartment. ...G.1.: Flatly decline

Johnny Richards, who died in Adelaide
at the end of January, was once a well-to-
do storekeeper at Moonta, and sat in Par-
liament for Wallaroo nearly 40 years ago,
Then he fell on evil days. Pulling himself
together a bit, he wrote rhymes and articles
for various papers, but never managed to
get his head quite above water again; and
as age weakened him, he was compelled to
“go on the Government.”

HOLLAND’S MARVELLOUS HAIR RESTORER
IS marvellous in name, and still more marvellous in its effect on the
growth of the hair.
Just fancy a lady who is seventy-five years of age being able to
do without her Toupee, which she has worn for years, through this truly
marvellous preparation giving her a splendid growth of hair. Another
lady wore a wig for six years, and she has now a good head of hair-
produced by this great Hair Restorer. A lady, writing from Paris,
France, asks me to post her a bottle, as she finds it absolutely the finest
preparation she has ever used. Lady Clark, when in England, wrote.
“Mv hair is coming out badly. I cannot get anything here to do it any
good Will you please forward me some of your Famous Hair Restorer.
This preparation, through sheer merit, has captured the whole world.
Before one shilling was spent on advertising it, it was used m fifteen
countries, and the sale has increased enormously since then.
It is absolutely the best Hair Restorer extant. It is the result of
thirty years of assiduous study of the hair and its treatment. It cleanses
the scalp and nourishes the hair, giving it a beautiful sheen. It is just
the preparation for these hot, dry climates. Its constant use will make
the hair thick, long, and rich in color. Use It on your children if you
desire for them a good head of hair. Price, by post, 3/6, 4/8, 5/9.
Gentlemen who are going bald should use SPECIAL PARASENE
and COSMO LOTION, one at night, and the other in the morning.
Price, with postage, two months’ treatment —Victoria, 10/6; four
months’ 20/-; other States, 11/6 and $2/- Ladies with hair falling out
should apply RESTORER at nighf, and COSMO LOTION in the
morning.
NATURALINE is a splendid preparation for coloring grey hair.
It acts quickly, naturally and effectively, and is perfectly harmless. Made
in all colors. Get the right strength —No. 1 for Light Brown Hair,
Medium or Medium Brown Hair; No. 2 for Dark Brown or a Light
Black; Extra Strong for Very Black Hair. Price—Victoria, with
postage, 6/3; other States, 6/8.
SHAMPUNA— A natural cleanser. No soap or borax. Does not
dry the hair. 3d. per packet; posted, 4d.; 13 for 3/4.

Vra , r of Toorak, had a bald patch on her head for
Mrs. M . i ?■,+£’ Xctrie an d other treatments by
a %?Z d w° Wth °of 'sale Gippsland, wore a wig for six years, her
,£in removing the di,=»« .nd giving her • good h«.d .1 ha.r.
A Doctor’s Wife in Fitzroy had Eczema all over her head lor
fifteen years. This was cured in three months with three bottles
° f jjrs k ,of AValbundrie, N.S.W., writes: “My scalp is
almost quite cured of the dreadful disease I have been afflicted
with for so many years. I am sorry I did not consult you
sooner.”
A lady writes from Richmond River, N.S.W.: I spent six
pounds on quack nostrums. One bottle of your famous Hair
Restorer has done mv hair more good than the scores of others
I have used. The more I used of them the worse my hair
became. It is now growing splendidly with your treatment.’
A lady writes from Florence, Italy: “You treated my hair
successfully with Phvtolene and Restorer for over twenty years
while I was living at Toorak. Since I have been here my hair
has all dropped out, and I cannot get anything here to do it
any good. Please: send me a supplv of Phytolene and Restorer.”
Mrs. R , of Sydney, writes: “The Naturalene you sent me
is just splendid; gives my hair a lovely tint, and is greatly
admired by all my lady friends.”
A lady from Perth, W.A., states: “Before I used your
Naturaline my hair was all the colors of the rainbow, through
using different washes; now it is just perfect with your
Naturaline.’’

The bather who .Crosses a favorite pic-
nicking beach barefoot always has to look
out for the glass splinters left by the bottle-
breaking hog —the clothed savage who, when
lie has eaten and drunk his fill, throws the
remnants of the feast at his depraved friends
and heaves rocks at the empty beer recep-
tacles until they are shivered into razor-
edged fragments. Ills limping victims never
catch up with him, and there is a foolish re-
luctance on the part of the public to get
him arrested when he is observed in the act
of scattering trouble around; consequently,
he works in safety. But one of the bar-
barians was caught lately through his own
bestial recklessness. He was on his way to
Brighton Beach : but, having an empty beer
bottle to dispose of, and being miles from the
strand, he hurled the thing at one of the
Flinders-street railway platforms. It burst
like a bomb on the stones, and a flying
splinter wounded a little fellow on the knee.
An opportune constable quickly collected
the thrower and conducted him away. It
was a very rare and beautiful occasion, and
it is to be hoped the Bench rose to it. If it
is not yet too late, the Religious Editor
would like to remind the Court that this is
an opportunity to warn the hog-relative who
hurls bottles from speeding motors.

THE TWO ISLANDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
News was brought to Sydney by the island steamer
Atua that the volcano on Neiafoou Island, which has
been in eruption, is now quiet, but the lake in the
centre is beginning to boil. The natives think there
is a likelihood of the island subsiding. They, how-
ever, go about their business in the ordinary way.
—Daily Telegraph.
The lake may boil, the earth may shake
Beyond all former measure;
The careless black no thought will take
When he’s about his pleasure.
And he, alas! is not alone
In such neglect of due care:
Qur nation may be stricken prone,
But what the do you care?
The sea may swamp the little isle
And drown the thoughtless nigger;
But do you think you’re safe to smile—
Your sloth may swamp a bigger!
For while you lounge about and grin
At little Willie’s drilling,
The blight of Asia, armed like sin,
Is getting warm and willing.
Australian skies are kind and blue,
But sudden death’s a trifle
To things that strike the careless crew
Who will not hold a rifle.
N.S.W.
CASSANDRA BIRD.
After weathering the storms of a quarter
of a century, the “Black Boy,” a freak
statue in charcoal, and an interesting land-
mark in the Tallangatta tourist district, has
just succumbed to white ants and weather.
The “statue” showed an aboriginal youth in
the attitude of walking, the body slightly
bent forward, with a boomerang carried in
front—all amazingly true to life. It figured
at various times in most of the illustrated
papers in Australia, and has been the sub-
ject of 10,000 picture post-cards.
The story of John Price, with a footnote :
Superintendent John Price decided to visit the
Williamstown quarries to inquire into the convicts’
complaints about meagre food and generally-bad
treatment. He went to the first quarry and asked
what the grievances were. He was surrounded by
men who were frantic with complaints. Some were
working in irons that weighed 301 b. Others were
starving. Others were half their time in “solitary.”
One convict had put in 231 days’ “solitary” out of
three years and eight months, on half rations.
Others were jambed into punishment cells so narrow
that a man could not sit, lie down or stand up—
this for 48 hours at a time. Price heard the men
for a bit and then proceeded to bully them, when a
gentleman “lifer” named Moloney roared out, “You
tyrant,” and threw a spall at Price. This was
the end. The 30 literally smashed him into a pulp.
Six were found guilty and executed. Some six years
ago, at the .disruption of the old cemetery on Gelli-
brand’s Poiilt, I witnessed the uncovering of the
remains of six convicts who lay side by side, un-
coffined, in their canvas convict dress, the broad
arrows still plainly visible. These were undoubtedly
the slayers of Price', All that remained were their
bones, and their rotting canvas dress. But the heavy
irons still gripped the shins!
“10-2-4”: Years ago I laughed, with the
cocksure scorn of the very young, at those who still
believed in the gag, so popular in England during
the Napoleonic wars, about one British lion being
equal to three French frogs. Remembering France’s
battle-records, the proposition seemed idiotic. After
carefully watching the efforts of the contingent of
French boxers, now in these parts, I think there may
be something in the ancient cliche, after all. I like
the Gaul immensely, and always have, but it does
not blind me to the fact that there is something
gravely wrong with his boasted valor.
The French pugs whom H. D. Mclntosh imported
last year are admittedly a representative lot. Add
Carpentier, and they would stand for Europe’s best.
They are as ’strong and well-built a lot as one could
wish to see. As boxers, they are, with one excep-
tion, in the front rank, or thereabouts. They train
faithfully, and are very fast. Now, consider their
performances. Leon Bernstein went up against Hock
Keys. Keys is a fine boxer, but he never had a
punch. He is now approaching middle age, and is a
persistent devotee of the frivolous life, as a result of
Which be has lost such slight ability to seriously
damage an adversary as he ever had. After half a
dozen unsensational rounds, Keys found a way t"
/Bernstein’s stomach, and'tapped it briskly several
times. Raising his hands aloft in dismay, Bernstein
galloped to his corner, and, leaning over the ropes,
declined to go on. He also burst into tears, and his
seconds presently followed suit. Paul Til pretended
to have been hit low in one fight and bolted out of
the ring in another. On both occasions he wept bit-
terly. Audouy went down without being hit in his
first fight. Balzac, who is as strong as a young
mule, and the possessor of a tremendous punch, put
it all over Midwood for several rounds. He closed
one of the Tasmanian’s eyes, had the blood pouring
from his nose and mouth, and knocked him down
some eight or nine times with smashing body blows.
Then Midwood got to work. He hit Balzac only
about four blows. They were enough. The alleged
descendant of the author of the “Corned ie Humaine”
made his own modest contribution to the humor of
life by hurrying to his corner and sobbing convul-
sively on the bosom of his compatriots there. The
other day he encountered Jerry' Jerome, an elderly
Dalby (Queensland) aboriginal, to whom stoush is
more a jest than a profession. According to Sydney
Evening News, “After lOsecs. fighting, while the
men were being parted from a clinch, Balzac landed
a blow on Jerry’s shoulder, and the referee warned
him. The black, judging his man cleverly, swung a
left to the stomach, and Balzac, howling with pain,
clinched.” Jerome hit the enemy once more, and
the fray ended. That is to say, Balzac fled to his
corner and stayed there. I have not seen one
Franco-Australian scrap in which the Gaul has
omitted either to talk reproachfully to the enemy, or
to the crowd, or to protest against purely' imaginary
fouls, or —the fight being over, and France defeated
—to pretend that death was imminent as a result of
injuries received. The practice of carrying the
wounded gladiator from the ring is essentially
French. These lads have repeatedly been borne ten-
derly to their dressing-rooms by their supporters when
there was not a mark on them. Apropos, Tommy
Burns had not to be carried away from Johnson after
enduring one of the most terrific hidings in the his-
tory of the ring, nor did he stop till the referee forced
him to. Which is luminous, in its own way, of the
whole difference between the French temperament and
that of the Yank, the Briton and the Australian.
The Frenchman would seem to have no fortitude.
He is a splendid and edifying spectacle while win-
ning—graceful, good-humored, chivalrous to a degree,
everything that is admirable. But the moment things
go wrong he becomes a physical, moral and every
other sort of ruin. Imagine Hughie Mehegan, McCoy,
Read or a dozen other Australian boys that might be
named stopping because they were hurt! J. John-
son himself could not make them do it. He might
render such dogged little battlers unconscious with a
clean knock-out, but to cause one of them to weep
or abandon the struggle while he had his wits about
him would be an impossibility. Nor is it the cus-
tom of these grimly business-like youths to appeal
for sympathy in any 6hape or form. They put tin
irreducible minimum of bellowdrama into their efforts
Generalisations are notoriously dangerous, but aftei
a season with the Frenchman, one begins to under
stand why the Gaul is such a good cavalryman,
aeronaut, motor-racer, etc., and such a poor hand at
rear-guard actions, and so on. He can take a risk,
apparently, but not a hammering.

IN
BANANA LAND
Before the made the sugar
business a whijte-ijian’s industry, in 1906.
Mackay’s biggest output, .had been 34,388
tons (raw). The abolition of the Kanaka
was going to lay the whole thing flat; yet
since it happened the harvest has fled up to
53,171 tons; and the coming season pro-
mises to make even that record look pale
and of no account. Since the beginning of
the year 2ft. of rain has fallen, and for the
first time in history mill managers expect
that they will have to start the rollers the
first week in June in order to put through
the huge crop by Christmas Eve. And this
notwithstanding that one completely new
mill and numerous additions have arrived
since Tommy Tanna was told to take his
discolored feet off the surface of the local
earth.
The tendency of lovely woman to plot a
little melodrama, with herself as the centre-
piece, was beautifully illustrated recently in
Brisbane. A girl employed in a cafd re-
ceived a packet of chocolates which, on open-
ing, gave out a peculiar smell. Her friends,
remembering the Warwick case, advised her
to take them to a chemist for examination,
and the chemist told her to take them to the
police. It turned out that the chocolates
had been doctored with carbolic acid, and
the detectives set to work to fish out the cul-
prit. The demeanor of the damsel herself,
however, aroused suspicions, and a rigid
examination elicited the confession that she
herself had sophisticated the stuff with car-
bolic in the hope that an alienated lover, on
hearing of the occurrence, might return to
his allegiance. Hereupon the erring maiden
broke down and took to bed. and the imag-
inary villain saved his neck for some future
occasion.
Matters in connection with the manufac-
ture of a Liberal candidate to have a cut at
Prime Minister Fisher for the Wide Bay
seat (Q.) are mixed. The two biggest
towns in the electorate —Bundaberg and
Maryborough—hate each other at all times
like poison and the Devil. Now they hate
each other like a whole chemist’s shop and
two devils. Maryborough is putting up
Col. Rankin, of the Burrum coal pits, while
Bundaberg submits D. T. Dillon, barrister
by trade and editor of the Bundaberg Mail
by occupation. While their backers have
been cursing one another, a third candidate
—Arnold Weinholt, member for Fassifern
in the State Assembly—has agreed to re-
sign his seat and contest Wide Bay at the
request of the Farmers’ Union. And though
Rankin lias a good following, being a lavish
distributor of floral tokens at shows, lun-
cheons and the like, it looks at present v as
though Weinholt will win the plebiscite
rather easily.
BREAKING THE NEWS.
“Mella, you know Jim Hoi land. Well, 'e's got ’urt!”
“ Ain’t surprised at that. Ihe wry that lig lump of a Mary Graham as bin flingin' 'er-
self at 'im all the summer!”
The- tropiftal outback of ’Queensland has
already had its second taste of Tophet-
weather this year. Near Cunnamulla, where
the shade reading crept up into the neigh-
borhood of 120 deg., one man dropped dead
in his tracks. Pie was some sort of dis-
colored inhabitant. The North is no place
for any but white men.
“The Rager”: Winton, in the Far West,
is haying n good lncluding a recent
refresher of £lO,OOO, it has drawn £23,000
in Tattersall sweep-money in 20 months —a
record, probably, for any wild and woolly
backblocks township of 1000 people. Pro-
vidence doesn’t seem to be always on the side
of the biggest battalions of church-goers.
Most likely because they have been hard-
ened up by a bit of military service, the
Germans are, without question, the sturdiest
humans who are nowadays coming into
Queensland. Four years ago some scores of
them took up land at Baffle Creek, fenced
their plots, put up houses and planted cane.
Just when the cane was looking magnificent,
down came 30in. of rain and ruined 90 p.c.
of the crop. A lot of fuss and appeals for
help ensued —but not from the Deutschers.
They were too busy rebuilding and replant-
ing to think about begging help. The other
day an old German lady with a handcart
containing all her belongings was travelling
up and down Southern Queensland looking
for land. After much consideration, she
lighted on a patch out Many Peaks way that
suited her, and forthwith proceeded to chop
down the light timber with a tomahawk.
When questioned as to how she was going
to live, in place of saying she must have
State aid, the old dame pointed to a supply
of beans, melon and cucumber seeds, from
which she hoped soon to make an existence.
Meantime, the British immigrant is much
too frequently growling because he can’t get
a job in town.
On Aery Vane.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s an aero-station standing by a tropic
Southern Bay,
And an aero-girl is waiting for a flying trip
to-day;
Soon her motor-gear will quiver and her fans
be beating free,
For she only waits a comrade who will
share her wingM glee ;
For the sea-birds seem to call
As the breezes rise and fall—
“ We’ve a shining world to show you, ivon't
you come and share it all?”
In her flashing, flying colors she’s a human
butterfly,
And her velvet black and orange couldn’t
fail to take your eye;
And the gleam that’s in her glance is mortal
foe to ev’ry gloom,
And the empty place beside her just affords
sufficient room
For a loving mate who’d call:
“Let us join the carnival—
There’s a world of juife before us, let us
sweep and taste it all.”
From a peak that kisses morning by the
waves of Panama
We shall sweep before the even where the
Maori built the pali;
And before another sunset sees us droop a
weary vane,
We may rest a while in wonder by the ,Coro-
mandel main :
We shall chase the setting ball v
As be dies at evenfal 1
In a bed of splendors that will lap us
one and all.
We may breakfast on old Snowdon, we may
sup beside the Lapp,
We may feel the frost of Zembla, and drop
greetings on the Jap;
And, it mav be, dusky maidens in the Coral
Isles afar
Will have kindly intuitions that there’s Love
within the car;
For the breezes softly fall
Through the palm-trees waving tall
When Romance is in the pinions that uplift
a lover’s all.
And it may be some sweet dawning we shall
sight the land again
That we parted from so lately for our flight
on fairy vane;
And, whatever Fate may give us from her
hands that make and mar,
Life is sweeter and completer for that aery
trip afar,
When we heard the seagulls call,
’Mid the breezes’ rise and fall,
We’ve a shining world to show you—won’t
you come and share it all?
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 8, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Governor Macgregor, at time of writing,
is leading the simple life on the Downs. The
other day lie took the vice-regal tin-opener,
or corkscrew, or whatever is used on these
occasions, and opened the Stanthorpe show.
He also performed the same kindly office for
the new golf links which the inhabitants
have just acquired. Mrs. Burt, who has sev-
eral pretty daughters, was mainly responsi-
ble for the links being started. Mrs. Eden,
the Queensland lady champion, smote a
sphere over the more or less turfy expanse,
after the Macgregor had chanted his incan-
tation and played the first ball off the cush
or to tjpe boundary for four, or something
equally intricate. Anyhow, it was a great
day.
With the assistance of an aide-de-com-
forter, his Ex. spent the week-end at Pike-
dale, the abode of the hospitable Whites.
He is due for a shakedown under the roofs
of Glenelg and Canning Downs, before the
Show spreads its sweetness on the Warwick
air, which will be next Wednesday.
Arthur Morgan is deputy-Governor this
week, and on Thursday he officially lunched
Lee Bryce, the Government Resident of
Thursday Island, at Parliament House. I
understand he did it as well as the imported
Chief Luncher, and at considerably less cost
to the country.
Minister for Agriculture White fed vari-
ous representatives of the Farmers’ Parlia-
mentary Union aboard the State’s sea dere-
lict, Lucinda, on Wednesday This morn-
ing, with Under-Secretary Seriven, he left
for Hobart, where an agricultural confer-
ence is to be temporarily added to the pre-
vailing dullness.
Judge and Mrs. Lukin are due back on
Tuesday from Melbourne and Maoriland. His
’Onor collected a young nephew at Mel-
bourne—one John Renwick—to act as his
Associate.
Miss Collins’s marriage to Captain Harris,
which happened at' the Anelican Cathedral
on Thursday last, was stage-managed in a
manner worthy «f the occasion. Each
female guest trailed a resplendent evening
gown, the while her headpiece shook with
feathers. The bridegroom dashed up in an
open carriage, drawn by six fatuous horses,
and ornamented_ with three brilliant but
embarrassed soldiers. The same conveyance
later on removed bride and ’groom to the
Hotel Daniel, where the breakfast was
gnawed. The bridal livery was of satin,
beautified with much rose-point lace. Four
bridesmaids—another Miss Collins, a Miss
Harris from Sydney, little Nanette Bruxner
(a niece of the bride), and one of Mrs.
William Collins’s little girls—lent their
moral support and physical encouragement
to the proceedings. To do this more effec-
tively, they dressed themselves in white
satin frocks, topped off with big white hat*
and balanced with sweeping scarlet plumes
Their hand bouquets were also scarlet in
appearance. The leading lady’s travelling
dress was a tailored coat and skirt, and the
trousseau deserved a whole press agent
do it justice.
Two other weddings this week struck
mauve and white color note. In one case”
the pretty little daughter of Dr. Clowes
made a dainty bride, and her attendant
bridesmaids, Phyllis Ilobbs and Kathleen
Murray, wore white alow and aloft, with
touches of black. Amidships they carried
mauve bouquets.
Nellie Lawrence, who was married to-dav
to Ted Oxley, a nephew of Chief Justice
Samuel Griffith, was a tall and graceful wife
of the new-made description, and her three
bridesmaids were pretty enough to create
some unrest within eligible bachelor bosoms
Gytha Oxley, Winnie Sutton and J oan
Gostling were the maiden’s supports. They
also wore white frocks and white chin hats
massed with lilac. Likewise, the hand gren-
ades were mauve.
The Anglican Cathedral was fairly copi-
ous on Tuesday afternoon, when Morae
Jackson was married to Claude Roe. Alollie
Roe and Mary Jackson, who assisted the
bride to the matrimonial stile, were draped
in uncommon garments of white ninon show-
ing touches of pink. The general effect was
greatly aided by rose-crowned hats. Even
the general effect of a dustman’s funeral
would be greatly aided by rose-crowned
hats.
Dudley McNab, a son of solicitor
McNab, has conspired matrimonially with
Jean Tait. Both were ardent skatists dur-
ing the short reign of the elusive Winslow,
and are equally ardent dancers. The lady
has an artistic eye for a becoming garment
of the female gender.
Mr. Norton, usually known as “Billy” to
his many sportsmen friends, is seriously ill
in the Gympie Hospital, but is putting up a
pluckv fight. Mrs. Norton, who is a daugh-
ter of Horace Tozer, has gone to the front,
"-'d is encamped with her sister, Mrs. Sync
The artist Penleigh Boyds are on their
way back to Melbourne on the Themistocles,
after a long holiday in Italy. They intend
to settle in Melbourne, where the male nart-
ner will, during the season, hold an exhibi-
tion of his work.
Mr. C. A. Arvier, secretary of the
National Agricultural Association, has been
seriously ill all the week, but shows a little
improvement to-day. Mrs. Arvier returned
from Melbourne last night.
The dull greyness of Lent is about to
settle on us, and the urgent bellow of the
fish-vendor is heard in the streets (most of
which are indescribably unclean).
Yours, in anticipatory sackcloth,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
At the opening of the Boonah School of
Arts, Treasurer Barnes paid a high tribute
to the generosity of Weinholt, M.L.A.
(Fisher’s coming opponent in Wide Bay),
“who had donated the whole of his Parlia-
mentary allowance to the Boonah hospital.”
It is to be hoped that Queensland will see a
day when this kind of “generosity” is treated
as a corrupt practice, and the lavish donor
is disqualified accordingly.
Colonel Flewell-Smith, selected by the
Liberals to contest the Brisbane Federal
seat against Finlayson, is, despite the
hyphen, a bluff, plain man, who pursued the
rooster in S’Africa, and got on exceedingly
well with his men. At Lytton camp, in the
old days, it used to be said that the Colonel
with the hyphen was the most untidy man
in the regiment, tie had a way of collect-
ing grease-spots and forgetting to abolish
them. As a Liberal candidate, the biggest
obstacle between' him and Parliament House
will be Joe Cook, the Labor backslider and
Foreign-trade apostate.
“Flinderino”: During 1912 there were
6600 tons of wool despatched bv rail from
Longreach* in the west of Queensland, and
only 600 tons of other loading. The other
loading was principally empty beer barrels.
There were 294 arrests in the woolly little
township last year, 174 of them being for
drunkenness. Resisting the police came a
good second. It speaks volumes for the
goodness qf the liquor. And the 150 motor-
cars in the district speak a whole library for
the sudden affluence of western sheep-men.
The Chinese communities in Australia are
permeated with secret societies, whose chief
side-line seems to be the defeat of the white
man’s law’. The other day, during the hear-
ing of a Brisbane case against a Chinese
firm accused of sly-grog selling, it transpired
that the big Yee Hing secret society was
mixed up somehow in the business. The
Yee Plings pose in Brisbane as a very
select push, but their enemies call them the
Hoong-to-Chut—the Society of Red-Headed
Thieves. And when a really high-toned Yee
Ding is contumeliously called a “Hoong-to-
Chut.” the air is liable to be filled with furv
and flat-irons and whaffors!

A mob of motorists were the other day
hauled before the Essendon (Vie.) beak for
having failed to cause their cars while
passing a place of public worship to travel
with as little noise as possible, and to travel
slowly.” In the test case heard it was ad-
mitted that the car could not very well have
passed with less noise; all that was com-
plained of was that the driver had not
slackened speed when his nostrils detected
'i-j ,°^ 0 , r •sanctity. The fool-regulation
didn t know, evidently, that by reducing
speed he would have made more noise ; and
the Court did the best it could, in the cir-
cumstances, by pouring out the whole jug-
ful of cases.
A nautical person, who seems to know
wliat he is writing about, last week threw
the lee scuppers at the Imperialistic flag-
fliers, and combed their tangled whiskers
with the anchor. He followed in the wake
of the salt who scornfully pointed out that
the flag on the State Savings Bank in Mel-
bourne had been distressfully flown upside
down; but he had rather more brine in.his
ink. He told how, on the occasion of some
trade picnic, he had noticed a twopenny cot-
ton Union Jack fluttering cheaply on an
elaborate flagstaff. Next day the forgotten
rag was still there; and it had been left
aloft ”"til the wind had shredded it to rags;
After all, patriotism is an easy virtue, pro-
viding you practise it on the right lines. It
is only necessary to wave a twopenny rag,
sing “Gorsave,” and bellow about disloyalty
to the Motherland whenever some rash fool
makes another step forward on the long ex-
pensive road that leads to our military and
naval independence of Ma. The Grand Old
Flag only costs tuppence, and “Gorsave”
and bellows cost nothing. And when all the
beer and champagne have been drunk, and
all the froth is off the oratory of yesterdav.
it is cheaner to let the cotton emblem of*
Britain s greatness wear out at the top of
its pole than to wrench Smith from his im-
portant invoicing job and send him to haul
it down. __
Australia takes another step in the big
matter of its sea-defence by inviting appli-
cations for entrance to the Navsl College,
loung Australia, looking for a career on an
Australian battleship, has a chance to find
it by applying any time between April 1 arid
June 30, to the Naval Staff office in Mel-
bourne.
On the same day ]ast week, S. M. Her-
ald announced the birth of Gwen Canberra
Peakes and the death of George Hogsflesh.
Ihe late Mr. Hogsflesh honorably endured
his name for 80 years, but it is unlikely that
he ever wrote poetry over it.
The ‘‘Year Book of Australia’s” offspring
the N.S.W. Year Book, is a large shilling’s
worth of knowledge. The publishers havf
squeezed into its 230-odd pages all the in-
formation—brought right up to date—that
anyqne is ever likely to want in a hurry
about. Ma’s Parliament, public offices, sport.
etc., plus a very full map of
JN.k.vv. s railways and two interesting sec-
tions devoted to Papua and the Northern
Territory.
Hindley, the quaint-looking and busy little
e lhQ urne archdeacon who is cheaply and
effectively attending to Clarke’s high-salaried
job while that imported cleric is away, is a
colloquial cleric. To an Age man, who went
along to see him in reference to some keen
newspaper criticisms, he confided that the
critic _ was “barking up the wrong tree.”
Amusing, but not quite so hilarious, as the
solemn assurance of an R.C. priest to his
congregation, at the conclusion of a sermon
on eternal punishment. “You can take my
tip for that!” boomed his reverence grimly.
Another holy pa (e youthful one, by the
way) recently talked to his flock on the sub-
ject of repentance, and, after assuring them
that the time was over ripe, added gravely :
“You’d better get a move on.” Religious
thunder is not so awe-inspiring when the
cheerful echoes of the Street .can be detected
in it.
From the Oldest Inhabitant;-
Here is the story of the late philanthropic Janies
Stedman, from the lips of James Stedman himself.
Born at Parramatta in 1841, he began the struggle
for t a. crust, at the age of 14. His boss was W. J.
Cates, who lived and made lollies at 348 Castlereagh-
street, between Bathurst and Liverpool streets, and
sold his g'oods in a stand in the George-street mar-
kets..: Having, done well, Cates went to England, and
business to Lewis Dettmann, a professional
cook ; he was father of John Dettmann, for many
years headmaster of the Public School at Bathurst
and major in the army of senior cadets. The Major
died about 10 years ago, leaving a son—now Pro-
fessor Dettmann, of the M.L. University When
Wright and Smith presently bought the business,
•James Stedman went with it as a part of the stock-in-
trade. < The old George-street markets were not
good enough for the new bosses, who took a
George-street shop. Stedman, the foreman, bought
the surviving partner out in 1875, and having made
a fortune for each of his employers commenced to
make one for himself, though he decided to confine
his trade to manufacture and wholesale dealing

Tho

TheMELOTTE
has the largest
sale in the

The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,

incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve co m-
pletely,' or were
liorn deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been __
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

“MAYS ITCHING
ALTO SCRATCHING’
Almost Unbearable. Around Ears,
Eyes, Forehead, Cheekbones.
Kept Awake at Night for Hours.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment Gave
Instant Relief. No Recurrence.
35 Francis St., Glebe, Sydney, N. S. W.
About two and a half years ago I was at-
tacked with an itching which gradually grew
\
in violence until it became
almost unbearable. In and
around about the ears, round
about the eyes, forehead,
cheekbones and all around the
jaws were so itchy that at
times I was almost driven
crazy. I thought at times it
would break out into open
( 6°res. The itching was always very trouble-
some when at work, and often kept me
awake at night for hours, in fact I had no
rest either night or day, always itching,
always scratching, always miserable.
“I had special ointments, lotions and
powders, and applied them faithfully, but
no lasting relief came. Just a few moments
of peace and then the itching would come
back as bad as ever. At last (after suffering
nearly two years), I saw an account of Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. I got a cake of
Cuticura Soap and a tin of Cuticura Oint-
ment and found instant relief. There has
been no recurrence of the itching in the
slightest degree for over four months.”
(Signed) Robt. S. Dodd, May 30, 1911.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment do so much
for pimples, blackheads, red, rough skins,
itching, scaly scalps, dandruff, dry, thin and
falling hair, chapped hands and shapeless
nails that it is almost criminal not to use
them. Sold everywhere. Liberal sample of
each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the Epglish so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks inv ImJ
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
£o say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

Uncle Sam is a born advertiser. In the machine
which helps to obliterate past Presidents’ counte-
nances from his postage stamps, he has lately in-
serted a little “block” which impresses the legend
“Panama Exposition, 1916,” on the top of the out-
ward-bound envelope. Thus an international in-
terest is being aroused in the Fair, which is, of
course, to lick everything previously held in the land
of the Wooden Ham and the Grilled Nigger.

Rockhampton (Q.) has a man who isn’t locally
taken as seriously as he thinks he ought to be. His
song is filled with bat guano. There are big caves
near Rockhampton, and the apostle of the new
manure alleges that there are thousands of tons of
merchantable goods on the premises. He has got
together the world’s literature on the subject of 1 at
guano, including some alluring Yankee figures; and
there are far more unlikely things than that he will
yet coin the stuff into good crisp Commonwealth
notes.

A giant cannibal snail, imported from Mexico, is
doing great business in the market gardens of Paris.
It is its habit to eat the:vegetarian snails, slugs and
other creeping things, and thus give the eauli-
blossom a chance to bloom. The worst of these im-
portations is that, unlike Johnson, of the N.S.W.
Railways, they so often change their ideas in a new
country. When the supply of herbivorous molluscs
is exhausted, the giant snails will probably turn on
the domestic cat, or in times of extra stress it may
try to eat the baby.
“Vag”: Being used to the old-fashioned frumps of
Messageries Maritimes boats that wander into Aus-
tralian ports, I was surprised to see one of their ships
at Singapore recently, and to note its handsome size
and appearance. It was the Paul Lecat, of 12,500
tons and 15 or 16 knots. I hear that there are two
sister ships on the slips, which will go on the same
“Eastern” run as soon as they’re ready. Perhaps
now that the M.M. has got into the building mood, it
may wake up to the possibilities of the Australian
trade, and put some ships on the run that are a little
less like herring-gutted arks. If the Germans can
scoop such numbers of passengers, there ought to be
a good chance for the Frenchmen.

“H.C.”: I’m having my first time in Sydney. All
the blokes seem to know it, too, ’specially the fellers
standin’ at the doors of tailors’ shops. Barmaids
pick me out, too. Heard a lot about city wine bars
so thought I wopld look at a few. Pulled up at a
place not far from the G.P.0., after puttin’ me
silver in one pocket and gold in the other. What I
seen was a counter, four or five chairs, some corners
curtained off, two tables and two girls. Plenty bottles
on the shelves ; plenty flour and raddle on the girls’
faces. Sat down on a chair and called for port,
that was the only brand I knew. We don’t go much
on wine up Nyngan way. The girls comes alongside
me. One of ’em says: “Goin’ to shout, love?” “Yes,”
I says, “for meself.” Jest then two young chaps
with straw hats and handkerchiefs stuck inside their
shirt cuffs comes in. They calls for sherry. The
girls leave me. Then they kissed, and was playin’
hands with the toffs. The toffs shouted for the girls
three times. When they wus leavin’, one girl says,
“Shout us a packet of cigarettes, love.” “Certaiulv,”
says one chap, and throws down a sprat. She takes
a packet of cigarettes from the shelf and puts it in
her pocket. When the toffs-go away, she puts it back
on the shelf. Seen that packet of cigarettes sold again
directly; I wasn’t hurrying. S’pose it had been sold
a thousand times before. S’pose it is still gettin’
sold. As I was spendin’ nothing, the girls didn’t
seem to mind when I said I was goin’. On me
way home I had a large pint, and says I to meself,
“All the mugs don’t come from the country.”

The alleged dishonesty of fruit-growers in “top-
ping” the cases of fruit they send to market is a
subject of Melbourne newspaper discussion these
times. Probably it was inspired by shopkeepers who
want the public to believe that they merely do as
they are done by. In any case, the alleged deception
practised on the wily Dago by the comparatively art-
less orchardist is one of those swindles “within the
trade” which cannot be long continued. Traders
know how to protect themselves against traders, and
the first care of the middleman is to get even with
the producer who has taken him down. On the other
hand, the public's only effective shield seems to be
the Law. The Dago system of first “stacking” fruit
with a view to attracting custom, and then manipu-
lating the goods so that the customer gets none of
what he bargained for, is a system of robbery by
legerdemain. The order as the shopkeeper executes
it is never Up to sample. A well organised vigilance
committee of citizens could bring the Dago brother-
hood to book ; but everybody’s business is nobody’s
personal concern, seemingly. So the swindle goes on
unchecked.

“A Perfervid Australian”: A remarkable display of
Australian timbers in the rough and made up into
furniture is the outstanding feature of the A.N.A.
exhibition in Melbourne. One piano of especial ele-
gance contains 12 different kinds of woods—Victorian
blackwood, Victorian mountain ash, Tasmanian fiddle-
back, blackwood, Victorian curly ash, Tasmanian
musk, Queensland silky oak, Queensland rosewood,
Queensland maple, yellow wood, Maoriland totara,
Queensland bean tree and pittosporum. My compan-
ion during the inspection said that thousands of tons
of the most perfect Tasmanian blackwood or fiddle-
back had been fed to the furnaces at Mount Lyell in
the early days of the mine. In my office the same
day a Gippsland cocky farmer told me he had just
bought 320 acres of land at 30s. an acre, which had
cost the original selector £25 an acre to clear and
burn off. The job broke both his heart and his bank
account. The new owner reckoned the timber on the
property was worth originally £lOO an acre. Hun-
dreds of settlers, including many immigrants, are
struggling with the forests of Cape Otway and South
Gippsland in precisely the same way at the present
time, and vast quantities of the finest hardwoods in
the world are being- destroyed to enable the cow men
to make two blades of grass grow where one forest
giant stood before. Not long ago I went by train
from Berlin to an outlying suburb, through a pine
plantation owned by the Prussian Government Everv
miserable stunted pine was fitted with a white'band
on which was painted the ledger number of the tree’
Ihe sooner our magnificent forests are treated in the
same fashion the better. The German Government
makes six millions sterling yearly out of its forests
and when one tree is cut down six saplings are
planted. And the pines, larches, firs and
ous trees, indigenous to cold Northern Europe, cin-
-omDarrd Wlth our glorious forest monarchs
in either comeliness or usefulness.

“0.K.”: There is a negative consolation for critical
Austrahans in the ugliness of the Commonwealth’s
poverty-stricken postage stamp. The rottenest States
in the world have invariably had the prettiest and
most expensive postage stamps. They seem intended
to inspire confidence in the foreign money-lender.
THESE MINOR APPETITES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
• t Ur Calls for Help!— Sensational advertis-
ing headline.
I heard my hair howl in the night,
And I woke from my slumber profound;
Straight I leaped in the dark for a light
And a hair “food” for virtue renowned.
There is not a more pitiful sound
Than the howl of some ravenous hair;
So of fodder I gave it a pound—•
I just plastered the banquet around—
And it silently soaked up its share.
O friend! are you starving your hair ?
Do you give it three square meals a day ?
Surely one you can easily spare,
Though you live in a very cheap way!
Then your skin has an appetite! Say!
Can’t you hear your hide voicing its need,
Like the beggar, old, drunken and grey,
Who keeps close on your heels till you pay:
“Now then, boss! Won’t yer stand us a feed ?”

SUNBURN is only one of the various
troubles caused by the sujtimer heat,
but it is accountable for £ very great
deal of discomfort, to say nothing of dis-
figurement. The skin is scorched and
becomes red and smarting and often
blistered. The face, neck, hands and arms
all present a most unsightly appearance
and are painful to a degree.
Rexona, the Rapid healer
will be found a valuable remedy for the sun-
burnt skin. It soothes the hot skin and
quickly heals all soreness and roughness.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap
should be used in conjunction with Rexona
Ointment, and will be found a great help,
as it keeps the skin soft and healthy. Its
regular use will go a long way towards
guarding the skin from injury by heat of
the sun.
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, is sold every,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
XJTTING the green hair of the world,
l The happy gardener smiled;
Cold mists about the harbor curled
The air was glad and wild.
I went as one who long hath seen
The midnight bubble break
On chaliced joy of amber sheen
For holy friendship’s sake.
I went as one who knowetli well
The quiet ways are wide,
And hath a secret thing to tell
The crayfish at his side.
The roses nodded on the stem,
Their petals drowned in dew*
The morning set a diadem
On everything that grew.
All buds and blossoms seemed to laugh
Along the pleasant way ;
I offered one tall sunflower half
My interest in the cray.
She smiled and put the gift aside
The while a silver tear
Dropped from an aster purple-eyed
Upon a pansy’s ear.
The happy morning seemed to sway
About me clear and free
Until that Wowser blocked the way
And made remarks at me.
It was Apollo, standing there
All white, and cold, and still,
Who caught my gladness by the hair
And strove my joy to kill.
“0 Fool of Dionysius’ rout,
What game is this you play?
The dark is gone, the stars put out,
111 fits this guise with day.
“Think you that I who will not brook
One shameless cigarette
About these ways '"dll overlook
Your trespass wild and wet?
“Hence from these shades! As Tempe’s
vale
I hold this sacred ground ;
Disperse the midnight fancy stale
That seems to hold you bound.
“Re off! I will arise and smite
My lyre, or you, or both.
Go!” And that piece of marble white
Swore an Olympian oath.
He waved his legs, he shed his cloak,
His stature seemed to grow:
“Don’t worry getting down, old bloke,”
I said, “I’d better go.”
I leaped away in eager fear
His dreadful wrath to shun,
The roses’ laughter shrill and clear
Helped me that morn to run.
The crayfish cn the asphalt fell
Behind me as I fled,
I recked not of its broken shell
Nor turned my fearful head ;
Till from the shelter of a tree
I dared to look again,
And saw a thing of mvstery
That filled mv soul with pain
That Wowser from his perch had flown
But three short steps or so,
He worked his legs and arms of stone
With motions stiff and slow ;
His pedestal stood hare and white,
And in the light of day
I saw that large Greek god for spite
Eating my crimson cray.

CURSE O’ MOSES.
A Slack Day at Keenan’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHY Keenan called his pub “The
Shearers’ Rest” it is hard to say.
Plenty shearers come here, but no
matter how long they stay they never rest
at least, not till the cheque is all gone, and
then they have to rest somewhere else.
It is scorching hot. Everybody is too
heavy and drowsy to stir. Keenan himself
sits on the verandah in a wooden arm-chair
with a low, uncomfortable back. There is
nothing comfortable about Keenan’s. He
looks as if he would go to sleep if he let him-
self. His big fat hands are clasped over his
paunch, and his eyes close, but keep opening
as if there was something to he suspicious
about. He sees things like a man at a very
poor bioscope show, where the operator is
getting his films mixed, and has a poor light,
and just when the angel is going to pick up
the poor little outcast dying in the snow the
machine goes pop.
His attention is mostly directed to a con-
sumptive-looking youth in city clothes, who
looks moodily at the dancing waves of heat
across the plain. Then sometimes he gives
attention to two shearers who sit on the form
some distance down the verandah. These
men are irritably disagreeing with each
other —at least one of them is.
Across the road are two men sitting on
their swags under a tliin-foliaged white
gum. These men are talking in the manner
of folk who are making schemes. Keenan
is most suspicious of them, but he directs
his thoughts at the consumptive-looking
youth.
“Yez do be cornin’ about and bangin'
about, but I niver say yez ever spind anny
money.”
And without waiting for a reply his eyes
close. The youth keeps looking at the mir-
age in the distance as if that were the place
tired people go to. Maybe he is trying to
imagine it is Sydney Harbor with the boats
on it.
After a late lunch Mrs. Keenan comes
out and leans a shoulder against the door-
jamb, and begins to noisily pick her teeth
vi ith a bit of wire. She is fat, like her hus-
band.
The two horses belonging to the shearers
swish their tails viciously, and stand with
their noses almost touching the ground.
Down the verandah comes the low, lazy
hum of the shearer who is being disagreed
with. Over the road the two swagmen have
then- heads close together very earnestly,
-the fate of nations seems to depend upon
their decision, but they are really wonder-
ing how they can lug Keenan for a beer
apiece.
M lien the taller of the two rises, Keenan
opens his eyes and watches him approach.
“Axing yer pardon, Mr. Keenan, sir, but
is there a letter here for the Hon. Adolphus
Cunningham, sir?”
“No,” snaps Keenan.
“Strange! Strange!” says the swagmah,
rubbing his hand on the back of his head.
“Who is it for?”
“Me mate, sir. Sure, he’s what ye cdlls
a remittance man, and he’s expictin’ some
money to be sint here care o’ your hotel.
Oh, will, it’s sure to come widin now and
sivin days.”
He is leaving, but, as an afterthought,
says: “Would it be an impertinence, Mr.
Keenan, sir, if we axed for accommodation
till it comes? For meself, Mr. Keenan, I’d
as lief slape be the dam, but me mate is a
man of luxury be way av his bringin’ up*
and betune ourselves, sir, he’s a divil to
booze. Small blame to him, his father bein’
a lord on the ould counthry.”
“Have yez anny money?” asks Keenan.
“No, sir.”
“Well, ’ave yez anny job to go to?”
“No, sir.”
“Well, I’m very sorry for yez, but ye are
only wastin’ yer toime ’anging about here
if yez ’ave no money or anny job to go to.”
“But yez would not be sendin’ off a felley
who is expectin’ a cheque, and is a lord’s
son, and a divil to booze, Mr. Keenan?”
“Me man, I don’t care if he is a king’s
son if he ’ave no money or anny job to go
to.”
“Mr. Keenan, sir, at least give us a beer
and let us go on our way and spake a good
word for ye, and in sivin days toime we’ll
come back for the cheque, and ye’ll get
ivery penny of it, sir.”
“Come back in sivin days toime, me
man.”
“For the love of Hiven, sir?”
Keenan waves his hand gracefully, then
closes his eyes.
“For the sake of ould Oireland, Mr.
Keenan?”
“I’ve got a great respect for the ould
counthry, but business is business. Come
to me whin the cheque comes, and we’ll see
all about it.”
Keenan then becomes so aggressively
asleep that the long swagman walks off
muttering to himself. Then Keenan opens
his eyes and says to the consumptive youth :
“Yez be expictin’ free board and free
beer, but it seems to me none of yez ever
’ave anny money. Oh, will, will, will!”
And he dozes off again.
Then all is silent excepting for Mrs.
Keenan noisily picking her teeth, and the
low voices of the shearer who can’t get his
mate to concur with what he is saying, and
the stamping of the horses as they try to
shake the flies off, and Keenan goes to
sleep.
Suddenly he is awakened by the con-
sumptive youth, who is shouting excitedly:
“There’s a fight, Mr. Keenan! There’s a
fight!”
Keenan opens his eyes. “A phwat?”
“A fight. See. They’ll be killing each
other directly.”
Keenan slowly lets his fishy-looking eyes
wander down the road, and sees the two
shearers thumping at each other with all
the willingness in the world. _ After gazing
at the scrimmage for a full minute: —
“Did ye say it was a foight?” he asks.
“Yes, yes, a fight!”
Keenan turns his head leisurely back to
his wife.
“Did ye hear that, Bridget?”
“Hear phwat, Keenan?”
“This lad here. He says it’s a fight.”
“Bless his innocent soul!” says Mrs.
Keenan, calmly. “He should ’ave been here
in the good ould days when we rigularly
had twinty-three foights before breakfast,
and ye cudn’t put ye fut to the flure for
blood.” Then she adds, retrospectively :
“Ah, thim were the good days !”
“But won’t you separate them before one
kills the other?” asks the youth, after wait-
ing to see what Keenan will do.
Keenan rises slowly and stretches him-
self, and says: “Oh, will, will! I’ll see
phwat I can do.”
He walks slowly across the road.
“Will, min, phwat is it arl about?” _
They have knocked off to get a bit of
wind. It is the cantankerous shearer who
answers: —
“This cow says he shore 180 sheep in one
day at Wantagideree.”
“So I did !” says the other shearer.
“You’re a liar; I’d tell me own brother
the same if he told me such a lie.”
“An’ cudn’t he?” asks Keenan.
“Why, they’re all wool to the heel,” says
the doubter. “There’s not a ringer in the
country could shear that many.” .
“And if that is phwat ye are fighting
about, min,” says Keenan, “I’d postpone it
till the air is a bit cooler, and some av the
boys come to see fair play. Come, be sen-
sible, lave it over till the boys from Yanka-
wongla and Tarcoola can come along to luk
on. ’Ave yez anny money?”
“Yes!” cry both, diving hands into their
pockets to put up coin by way of a wager.
“Will, sink yer differences for a toime,
and go in and have drinks. There’s me
woife standing there doing nothing wid her
good right arm just aching to grip on a
beer pull. And there are two min here
waiting for a cheque for wan av thim, both
dliry for a drink widout the money to get
it And here we ’ave a poor bhoy from the
city (who luks as if he’s after an under-
taker, but says it’s a job) who will get a
new lease of loife if he has a good dhrop ot
brandy. So let it stand over till the bhoys
come, and we’ll make an evening of it.”
All the time he is pushing the two men
into the bar, and when he sees the five in
front of the counter with his wife behind,
he goes back to his chair and begins to do.ze,
mechanically patting Billy, the bull terrier.

SKIN
TROUBLES.
SUNBURN. BLISTERS. PRICKLY HEAT, SMARTING
PATCHES, INSECT BITES, ITCH § KINDRED SKIN
TROUBLES PROMPTLY HEALED BY ZAM-BUK.
IN summer the skin is made tender bv
excessive perspiration ; and the badness
I I imprisoned in the tissue, owing to the
sluggishness of the pores, is drawn out in
the form of pimples, rashes and heat swellings.
The strong air of the country or the seaside
does not always suit the skin of the town
dweller, while a change of water frequently
induces a burning irritation and rash that is
even more discomforting than sunburnt and
peeling arms and face, because this irritation
provokes rubbing and scratching, which opens
the way for eczema or some poisoned sore.
The best check to these skin troubles is the
regular use of Zam=Buk, w hich is a pure skin balm.
For removing that tingling irritation known as
Summer Itch, or Prickly Heat. Zam-Buk is invaluable.
Zam-Buk is also highly recommended for taking the sting and smarting
out of fhsect bites, for it not only soothes pain, but counteracts any
poison that may have been introduced into the system.
Zam-Buk has achieved a world=wide reputation for purity and
effectiveness.
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
SUMMER RASH.
Mrs. L. Switzer, of Ethel Street, For-
restville. Adelaide, says: “Overheating of
the blood caused a nasty rash to break
out at different periods on the back of
my neck. This was very irritable, and it
was a matter of difficulty to keep my
hands from it. My mother, who always
used Zam-Buk in the heme, recommended
me to try this balm. 1 did so, and in a
short time the rash was completely
ended.
“My sister has also be«i cured of skin
eruptions by Zam-Buk.” -
sunburn caused blisters.
Mr?. A. Lamploagh. of High Street,
Chelmer Hill, Mount Morgan (Q.), says:
re day daring the holidays my boy,
who had been swimming, complained of
a nasty pain on his back and shoulders.
On Ftam ining him I found that the sun
had bapnt him so badly that the skin was
hanging in water blisters, and the poor
lad could not bear the weight of his
clothes :-r. hint. After picking the blisters
I applied Zam-Buk all over his back, and
in a week the smarting and soreness had
quite gone away.”
For all Summer Skin Troubles, as well as the minor everyday
accidents that happen in every home, Zam-Buk is invaluable.

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain's Colic &: Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

vkv hritrstsox, Parramatta Rd., Leichhardt. Is.S.W•
In the distance rises a cloud of dust. It
comes nearer and nearer till out of the
drift comes a ramshackle American buggy,
drawn by a grey mare which jogs on with
au effortless “for ever and ever, world with-
out end. amen” sort of gait. It is a little
man with a bullet bead aud big ginger grey
whiskers who drives. At least lie holds the
reins, with his chin sinking on bis chest.
When he drops right off to sleep the mare
stops. The cessation wakes him. and he
reaches for the whip, and the mare bolts for
about ten yards, and then falls into the dis-
iuterested jig-jog again. Behind the buggy
lopes a blue cattle dog. sulky and wicked,
his whole demeanor proclaiming him one
who should be doing time. And a long time
too —he is a real criminal in the way of
dogs.
Just as the buggy is a little past the pub,
Billy, the bull-terrier, revolves himself into
a canine cannon-ball and hurls himself at
the blue dog. It is a custom he has with
dogs whose masters do not pull ‘up for a
drink. In a second the peaceful atmosphere
is changed, and a palpitating commotion
fills the place. The two dogs are mixed up
in a cloud of dust, and you can't tell how
the fight goes, excepting that Billy has met
his match. The old man with the ginger-
grey whiskers has jumped down to separate
them. Keenan rushes out ihto the road.
Each man seizes his own end of dog. The
five men in the bar come streaming out, led
by the bogus lord's son. who is wiping his
month and shouting: “Let- 'em alone, can't
yer! Let 'em fight it out. blank vers!” He
seizes the ginger-grey whiskers, and pulls
the old mau away from his d<g. “Let go.
or I'll stoush yer!” he says. The old man.
not used to such disrespect, hits out, and
the two become mixed up.
At the same time rhe doubting shearer
is also saying: “Let 'em alone. Let the
dogs be." And the Irish swagman (the
bogus lord’s son's mate! kicks Keenan vig-
orously to draw attention to the wishes of
the spectators.
"Who was that kicked me?” cries Keen-
an. letting go his dog.
"He did." says the swagman. pointing to
the consumptive-looking youth.
Before Keenan can rebuke the youth,
however, the doubting shearer says: “You’re
a liar! You did !*’ Adding: “Why don't
you be a man and own up?"
"How dare you say I kicked Mr.
Keenan.*’ says the Irishman. “Me kick
me own countryman! Now I come to think
av it. I belave it was you that kicked him.”
This is more than the blood of an aggres-
sive shearer can stand. They sail into each
other. With the exception of the old man
and the bogus lord's son. the contests open
equal. Billy sometimes has the bine dog by
the ear. and sometimes the blue dog has
Billy by the throat, and what the Irishman
gains in length of arm is equalled by the
shearer's agility. As for the old man. he
must have been a champion heavyweight
at one time, because he has the alleged aris-
tocrat all over the road, till the poor fellow
doesn't seem to realise whether it is a fight
he has rushed into or an active volcano.
Mrs. Keenan is blas4 regarding tights.
But she has a certain idea of fair play, and
suddenly she notices that ••ne of the com-
batants has a grey beard. She clutches a
waddy. and then sails out and begins to
beat the bogus nobleman, crying: “For
shame, ye great hulkine vagabond, fighting
an old man who might be your grand-
father." Under the bombardment the fel-
low runs away. He picks up his swag and
begins to head across country. Then Mrs.
Keenan turns her attention to the blue
cattle dog which has Billy securely by The
throat. The unusual sight of a woman in
the fight causes hostilities to cease between
the shearer and the Irishman (or perhaps
one of them has had enough). The Irish-
man. with all the gallantry of his race,
comes forward to assist the lady, and he
gives Biliy a kick in the ribs, which tears
him out of the blue dog's mouth, and lands
him almost dead a dozen yards away.
"Ye hnlking scoundrel, ye. How dare ye
kick me dog." she says, and catches him a
blow with the waddy. That ends it. The
Irishman says: “That's all the thanks wan
gets be helpin’ ye to siparate the dogs.”
And he picks ud his shirt and swag and
follows his mate, still half naked. The old
man jumps into his trap, whistles to the
blue dog. and the whole turn-out goes away
with the "world without end" jig-jos that
brought them to the spot. The two shearers
jump on their horses and gallop off. the
aggressive one yelling and waving Ms shirt
in the air. giving the impression that he
has been enjoying himself immensely.
Keenan alone stands on the road, looking
first after one and then after another, till
all have disappeared in their several direc-
tions. and then he says: "Will, will, will,
will!’’ and goes and sits down.
“It was rather a willing go. wasn't it.
Mr. Keenan?" says the consumptive youth,
who alone remains.
“Don't ye think It better to be going?”
says Keenan. "Yea come about Inkin’ for
free males, free beer, free fights, bnt it
seems to me none of yez ever "ave anny
money. And. annyways. I don’t want to
say anny more av ye.”
ROBERT BROTHERS.
The Ad.-man‘s Armageddon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Advertising Man shivered from the
crown of his dove-grey hat right down
to the patent woven instep of his
fancy socks to match.
The position was indeed desperate. The
last prospect had been exploited, the last
newspaper had ceased publication, the last
hoarding shrieked its lurid message to an
empty world. Only Chaos remained! Yet
the fever of canvass was upon him. It had
to find outlet somewhere. But where? In
puzzled meditation the ad.-man munched the
butt end of his fountain pen. tlvn wept in-
s .vent tears upon the virgin blankness of
the Contract Form before him. Like an
Elbert Hubbard in the wiidern-ss. he han-
kered for the Yellow Press. The “sign it
now“ square of his jaw shrank flabbily: he
was fairly "np a gum. He. the hero of a
hundred advertising stunts —he to have to
call quits! The very idea of it blacked his
seal with scare-heads.
Could Fate be so unkind as to let talents
like his waste eloquence on an ad.-less air?
Never!
Coming up the deserted street, a stranger,
dressed with Collins-street immaculateness,
debonnairely flicked a light cane against his
patent-leather shoes.
The ad.-man leapt from his seat as if it
were a nest of bulldog ants.
‘‘The devil!” he muttered. “I’ll catch
him for a contract, or I'll be hanged!”
He quickly hid the Contract Form in his
pocket, put his fountain pen out of sight, and
got his hospitable cigar-case ready. The
"sign it now" square of his jaw was terrible
to gaze upon.
Introductions were dispensed with. They
usually are when the last ad.-man meets the
last prospect.
"In the theatrical line, I take it?” he
queried of the newcomer casually, feeling his
ground.
“Sure,” came the prompt answer, with a
nasal accent. “Going to run a melodrama
turn at the Inferno.”
Advertising men know everything. They
have to. It’s part of their stock-in-trade.
“The Inferno, eh? Jolly good stand!
Push it well, and you'll do record business!”
Breezy optimism pays big when handling
a prospect.
The stronger looked at him interestedly, a
cryptic smile lurking somewhere about the
corners of his eyes. “Think so. Mister? Sure
now you're not dealing me out hot air?”
This was the ad.-man’s opening. He leapt
into it. “Hot air. sir!” he answered.
"There’s no hot air about me. I’m stating
a plain business proposition. You're run-
ning this show at the Inferno. Now. you let
me run the ad. campaign, and I'll bring every
living soul to see it!”
The ring of conviction, the fiery zeal of
the fanatic was in his voice.
The prospect seemed duly impressed.
“What do you advise?” he asked.
“I don't advise, sir. Let me tell you that.
I knotc and he drove his Barrios diamond
ring into the table. “Just this. Double
page ‘spreads’ in all the big newspapers:
big black-letter display: S-sheet bills on all
the hoardings in four colors: cards in the
trams; top up with good dodgers, snipes and
stickers.”
He leaned back, lit another cigar and
looked at his victim with the tender solici-
tude of a mother fondling her poodle.
The prospect seemed turning something
over in his mind. too. He was silent, lightly
caressing the centre crease of his very per-
fect trousers. At last he ventured a ques-
tion. “As regards the little matter of ——-
But ad.-men know their marks. Like a
bar-lounger, when there’s a “shout" in
view, he leapt into the breach.
“Cost, eh! That is what you are consid-
ering? Don't consider it. sir! It is results
that count. Look at Rockefeller —he'd have
been burning candles still oecause kerosene
was too dear if he had counted cost. Look
at King O'Malley: would he have given a
half-guinea for his sombrero if he didn’t
know it would catch more votes in the end
than a 3s. lid. straw boater? Every time
it's the man who lunges out that lands the
splosh. Make no mistake, sir. I kitoir !”
“But how about the papers—there are
none running? And the hoardings—who's
going to litho and display the bills? The
printing and all that —how can it be
arranged 7”
“Sir!” replied the ad.-man. swelling out
his chest haughtily to spar for time while
he racked his brain for an apt remark from
"The Business Man’s Book of Maxims'*—
"big men don't know difficulties. They just
big through them. IH see to all that, don't
you worry P* As he said this he was writ-
ing out the contract and handing his foun-
tain pen to the stranger. "Thanks, just sign
here.” he said casually. “A mere matter of
form, you know!”
But the last prospect was wary. “Oh.
we’ll fix that up directly. Come along to the
Inferno with me and have a look at the
show.”
There was nothing else for it. The ad.-
man realised deference was the better part
of contract-getting. With a jaunty smile
that smothered his chagrin, he linked his
arm with that of the stranger, and together
they went down the deserted street. But in
his right hand the ad.-man carried the Con-
tract Form: in his waistcoat-pocket rested
the ever-ready fountain pen!
“Yon know the Inferno. I think yon told
me?'” remarked the prospect.
“Know it? Rather think I did! Fsed to
be on the door!” he answered promptly. Ad.-
men always answer promptly.
Just then the earth opened and great
buildings went toppling into the abyss at
his feet. Blue flames leapt up everywhere
and the air was filled with sulphurous
fumes. A crowd of tailed and horned supers,
each with a property pitchfork in its hand,
surrounded the pair. The heat was intoler-
able. : •.
The stranger spoke first: “Here we are
then. Come alc&g!”
But the ad.-man never turned a hair or
moved a muscle, standing as one in a reverie.
Suddenly he clutched the stranger’s arm.
looked down the flaming abyss, and said
eagerly: “What a chance to boost a cool-
drink campaign there, eh? Hang me if I
won’t start the Asbestos Bajtxb* and rnn
half-page displays in it T" He made as if to
step downward, caught with the magnificence
of his idea.
It was the stranger's turn new to be non-
plussed. He had met martyrs before. Plenty
of them were guests of his. But never had
he met a martvr to a mania like this. With
a perturbed frown he moved aside, and
at bis companion in
"Wall, you are the dizzy limit!” he said.
But the ad.-man never let np. He held
out the Contract Form in one hand, the foun-
tain pen in the other: and the “sign-it-n w"
jaw was simply terrific in i’s m-naee. “Jnst
sign here, please !** was all he said.
With a melodramatic roar of hauled rage
the stranger leapt into the f ames, and. as
the abyss closed over him. he called out:
"There’s not room for two of ns down here.
Things would be too hot.”
• * * *
AH was silence. Tee last ad.-man was
alone. The latest new? of him was that he
had turned away, and was looking yearningly
t- wards the sky while he planned in his
mind a w or.d-beating campaign for two
Celestial specialties—a Patent Feather-
Cleaning Preparation and an Improved Tun-
ing I. rk for Harps.

Where the Sawmiller
Comes In
This is an ad. for the sawmiller. There isn’t room to say much, but
we want to tell you that the Waterous Circular and Bog Band Mills
are the most efficient you could install. They come from Canada—
the home of the big timber industry, and our Waterous expert, with
30 years’ Canadian Milling experience, is ready to give you the
benefit of his advice. He’ll want to sell you a Waterous plant, but
not unless he CONVINCES you that it’s the mill par excellence.
A planer by S. A. WOODS is a good machine to install with a
Waterous plant. It has an automatic carriage feed that enables one
man to cut boards at the rate of—well, you’d say “thumbs up” if
we told you how fast it will cut, and there’s no room to prove it here.
But spend a penny stamp and two minutes of your time to ask for
proof that it’s the fastest planer on the market. Will you?
