A little of this. A measure of that.
Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . .' drawn
from the largest and finest reserves
in the world. That’s why the subtle
excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy
in the district of Cognac before
Napoleon was born.
Hennessy Cognac is distilled and

WYNNS
ESTATE
WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’65 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’65
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Hermitage
Long weeks of sunshine and
a rain-free vintage period
favoured the sensitive Her-
mitage (Shiraz) grapes in
1962. After two years in oak,
the wine was bottled and lain
down for further maturing.
Now obtainable, this Hermi-
tage is soft and generous
a full, distinctive wine.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’64 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’64 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

LETTERS
After Vatican II
Sir,
Congratulations on Peter Gough’s
extremely extensive and perceptive look
at Catholicism post-Council. I think he
goofed in only one aspect —that some-
one has to sit down and write a
Catholic novel. I presume he would
use a Catholic ribbon on a Catholic
typewriter. This would then necessitate
other men with other labels round their
necks sitting down to write a Metho-
dist novel and an Anglican novel, and
perhaps even a Calathumpian novel.
Surely the whole message of the new
movement is to turn the face of the
Church to the world and to make
“Christians adult enough to assume a
world view. So long as we remain so
conscious of being Catholic rather
than Christian, then we shall retain
that insularity and immaturity that has
tagged us in the past. The moment we
shall begin thinking of becoming whole
Christians with a Christo-universe-
centred life, then we might begin to
grow and be mature, rid of the clergy
domination.
Surely this is the message of de
Chardin, who places the Christian fair
and square in the midst of evolution-
ary society. And it should be remem-
bered that it was not the Jesuits who
brought his message to people, but
loyal lay friends, who had his works
published minus Church approval.
Teilhard is not thought of so much as
a Jesuit priest but as a prophet of hope
for all men. So I say, let us forget our
labels while retaining the core of
Christ’s life. Then the petty divisions,
enmities, rivalries, and wasted dupli-
cations may quietly disappear.

Sir,
There was an erroneous assertion
about Opus Dei in the article “A Year
After Vatican II” (8., Nov. 12). Opus
Dei is not a secretive association. It
does not have any hidden or mysterious
aims that it tries to conceal. The only
aim of Opus Dei is one of a spiritual
nature, namely to foster the pursuit
of Christian perfection in the midst
of the world by people of all social

strata and all walks of life, each one
seeking that perfection in his ordinary
work and the normal circumstances of
his life.
There is no secret teaching in Opus
Dei. Its teaching is no more and no
less than the teachings of the Catholic
Church. All the members accept all
the truths that every Catholic must
accept if he wishes to remain in the
Catholic Church. Every member is free
in regard to all opinions that other
Catholics are free to hold. The mem-
bers of Opus Dei do not keep any
secret about their membership. All the
people who make up the circle of
their friends, colleagues, and acquain-
tances know about their membership.
Since that membership is a personal
matter affecting the realm of their own
conscience, they have no need to
advertise it. They sincerely strive to
live an authentic Christian life and do
good to all men without boasting about
this commitment.
The names and addresses of the
central and regional directors of Opus
Dei are public knowledge. The names
and addresses and activities of all its
corporate apostolic works—all of which
are of an educational, social, or benevo-
lent nature —are also public knowledge.
A case in point is Nairana Cultural
Centre, 4 High Street, Randwick,
which is publicly known as conducted
by Opus Dei. It is also a fact that no
one who has ever come seeking infor-
mation has ever been turned away.
The truth of the matter is that the so-
called secrecy of Opus Dei is a pure
myth.
GEORGE BLOCK
Director, Nairana

Randwick (N.S.W.)
Sir,
It was refreshing to read the article
(8., Nov. 12) by Peter Gough. I heart-
ily agree with him in his general atti-
tude and findings. But a few minor
details might be disputable, which is a
good thing, promoting that “dialogue.”
After the age of 15, indeed, religious
education seems to stop for the majority
of Catholics, but we should not forget
the increasing number of adults who
take part in religious discussion clubs,
courses of “theology for the laity,”
and the training and living gospel dis-
cussions of the YCW and Catholic
Action groups. And these, not the
Catholic schools, will bring Christian
principles into Australian Catholicism.
A good Christian Family is the greatest
asset in Christian education, and no
school, not even the best Catholic
school, can take its place. It is a good
thing that Peter Gough pointed out the
shortcomings and deficiencies of the
Church here: recognition is the first
step toward improvement. But we must
not forget that the move in the right
direction has already started, although
it is much slower here than elsewhere.

Schizophrenics
Anonymous
Sir,
Probably many many thousands of
the 110,000 Australian unhappy victims
of the dread tormenting “scourge of the
twentieth century,” schizophrenia, and
their relatives and friends are search-
ing desperately for information and
hope about this devastating illness. I
can put them in contact with the rapidly
spreading American Schizophrenia
Foundation, Schizophrenics Anonymous,
the book “How to live with Schizo-
phrenia,” the newsletter “Schizo-
phrenia,” and other information.

An Erosion of Faith
Sir,
The highest compliment any journal
published in a democratic society could
possibly hope for is respect. Certainly
not trust, but at least respect. The
political sympathies of the Editor or
his staff are their acknowledged right;
the manner in which these are cham-
pioned, however, should be a reflection
of their integrity and awareness of
journalistic responsibility. After a close
reading of the tub-thumping attacks
mounted against Sydney University and
its newspaper “honi soit” in the editorial
and news sections of THE BULLETIISj
last week, I can only sadly conclude
that it is rapidly losing that respect
which it had previously held.
From fundamentals, let us begin by

correcting some of the grosser misrep-
resentations which appeared in both
the editorial, “An Erosion of Faith,”
and in Peter Samuel’s news story, “Honi
Soit.” While we realise that “Freedom
of the Press” includes a freedom to
exclude, the substance of the matter
which was conveniently disregarded in
these articles is significant to the extent
that its absence constitutes a criminal
and deliberate distortion. The front-
page essay which appeared in the
October 20 edition of “honi soit”
“Waiting for Lenin” was not the
work of any member of the newspaper’s
staff or, in fact, of the entire university.
It was a translation of the editorial
which appeared in the August issue of
the French news magazine “Les Temps
Modernes.” Its author is the dis-
tinguished French writer Jean-Paul
Sartre, no mere journalist hack by any
stretch of the imagination. The whole
of this information was displayed in a
prominent position below the head-
ing (Sartre’s byline was in type a full
three-quarters of an inch high) and
could not possibly have escaped the
attention of even the most flippant
reader. Implying, as both the articles
in question did, that this essay
had Sydney University origins is a
blatant abuse of the privilege which
published political commentators enjoy.
More objectionable than this
amateurish little deception is the over-
bearing tone of paranoia which leads
the authors of these two articles into
even wilder and more illogical state-
ments concerning the “academic left.”
With a self-indignant and moralistic
frenzy which quite overshadows the
worst of Goldwaterism, your editorial
attempts to construct an image of vic-
timised professors stalking about the
campus in icy rejection, students
furiously plotting character assassina-
tions in the subversive and fanatical
environment of a tiny editorial office,
and Red academics all scurrying off
to Peking to soak up the latest words
of wisdom from Chairman Mao. It
would be difficult to find a more
pathetic vision of University politics
in the archives of the John Birch
Society. Our beloved head of the
Department of Music at Sydney Uni-
versity, Professor Donald Peart, has
recently completed an extensive tour of
the Soviet Union to study developments
in music education is he now to be
charged with being a revisionist lackey
and fellow traveller?
The insistence in the editorial that
political action is confined to a minority
of the university population is no revel-
ation. This has always been the case.
Lamentably, very few students or
academics bother about politics, but
surely the fact that the Left-wing group
among this minority has had the
courage and tenacity to ensure itself a
hearing is a valuable aspect of the
relative freedom of expression which
we enjoy within the university.
In turn, to imply, as both the editorial
and news article did, that the Rightist
faction is held in hysterical contempt
by the remainder pf the university is yet

another fiction based on ignorance. In
the edition of May 14 of this year,
“honi soit” published the longest single
feature in its 37-year history—“ The
Politics of Liberty”—by Professor David
Armstrong. This was a strongly anti-
Communist article, printed without cuts
or editing in any form. Now we find
in THE BULLETIN that the dear pro-
fessor is being attacked most unfairly
and is in imminent danger of being
bundled out of the university by fanati-
cal Left-wing extremists! Even the
democratically minded professor would
concede that a little give-and-take is
a necessary evil of any “free” society.
Yes, we agree, “In the long-term in-
terests of universities it is important
that injustices of this sort should be
subjected to public inquiry,” but let’s
get our facts straight and our attitude
rational before we begin. If THE
BULLETIN can publish Dr. Knopfel-
macher’s sneering and superficial
analysis of the Berkeley Student Protest
movement and Brian Buckley’s still-
born bons mots on anything from sex
to the Soviets, then “honi soit” cer-
tainly has the right to print what it
feels is justifiable and fair comment.
DAVID SALTER
Director of Student Publications,
Students’ Representative Council,
University of Sydney.
Sir,
Apart from stylistic considerations,
I agree with you that the pre-
LBJ issue of “honi soit” is fantas-
tic. It is the last issue of the year,
and hence the last issue by that editor.
His political views being as they are, it
would have been fantastic without LBJ.
However, I disagree strongly with the
way you interpret “honi.” What is “un-
healthy” about having an editor with a
strong political bias for two terms? It
is nonsense to claim that students are
converted en masse to the editor’s point
of view, and since the paper is dis-
tributed only within the university it
can hardly upset the population out-
side (except when it is subjected to
attack by narrow-minded magazine
editors). Most students violently dis-
liked our editor’s extremism. The im-
portant thing is that “honi soits”
cause a violent reaction; they make
students think out their own atti-
tudes (since they cannot complacently
accept what they are given), and
thereby, perhaps, aid the “search for
truth.”
TONY CRAWFORD
Sydney University.
Sir,
Having waved “simple - minded”
banners at President Johnson and writ-
ten “diatribes” for a student newspaper
opposing our commitment in Vietnam,
I suppose I qualify as a member of
the “hysterical,” “extremist” minority
which you believe is eroding “public
faith in universities” (8., Nov. 12).
What is judged extreme depends, of
course, on one’s choice of reference
point. I think you should be warned
that, given the reference point implicit
in your editorial analysis, there is a
great deal of “extremism” current in
our universities.
A recent survey of academic opinion
in ten universities found an absolute
majority opposed to our commitment
in Vietnam among the 1300 members
of academic staffs who replied to the
survey form circulated. Follow-up
studies, at one university only, of the
two-thirds who did not reply on the
first asking indicate that among these
about an equal proportion are for and
against the war, with a large number
(30 percent) undecided. Overall the
indications are strong that, among those
people in universities who have come
to any clear decision about the war, a
substantial majority are opposed to it.
Even though there are “extremists”
among those academics responsible for
the survey this result is perhaps deserv-
ing of attention. Especially when one
finds that for the 768 respondents with-
in the status range professor to senior
lecturer, 56 percent opposed the war.

Emilio Greco’s Painting
Sir,
Dr. Berger (8., Nov. 12) is wrong in
thinking that I confine the practice of
contrappostp and figura serpentina to
the Renaissance; I simply said that
Greco took his usage from that period.
Everyone knows that Delacroix was
a romantic and many know that Greco
is a classicist, but classical forms, how-
ever obscured by romantic gloom, find
their way into Delacroix, who was in
love with classical Greece. It’s not
unlikely, therefore, that one of Greco’s
more passionate heads could “recall
the civilised animality of a Delacroix.”
No one seems to consider Donatello,
who Dr. Berger thinks is a more fitting
comparison for Greco, a Gothic sculptor;
he is generally considered a master of
the incipient Renaissance and, oddly
enough, his last work, the “Mary Mag-
dalene” of 1454-55, is the only one
thought by some scholars to be a re-
version to Gothic styles.
Even if, as Dr. Berger says, the
Opera House is an example of “our
destination”' a neo-Gothic era
this proves nothing about any Gothic
traits in Greco, and has nothing to do
with my review.

KATE KELLY'S TROUPE
86 Years Ago: November 27, 1880
'J'HE Kelly troupe made their first
appearance on the night of the
same day as that on which their
relative was executed. The locale was
the Apollo Hall, Melbourne, where
some speculating miscreant exhibited
them to the tune of a shilling a head
admission. Kate Kelly assumed a
bouquet.
Last Saturday night the Kelly gang
stuck up the whole of Campbell
Street, Sydney. This street was posi-
tively blocked with every rank and
sex, all eager to feast their eyes on
the fascinating spectacle of a rough
bushman and his helpless sister. O
curas hominum! What trifles form the
cares of men; and ditto as regards
the women. Unless prevented by the
authorities these talented artistes show
this week, and we venture to remark
that their opening night will bring
a greater crush than an Irving
Shakespearian reading or a Sims
Keeves and Santley concert.
"JT'VERY woman in the community
was shocked at Kate Kelly’s un-
feeling conduct on the night of the
day on which her brother was
executed.
r FHE Melbourne spiritualists claimed
Ned Kelly as a medium.
A GRAVE-DIGGER was on the
jury at Ned Kelly’s trial.

continuous' success in the East
African Safari—acknowledged as the
world’s toughest rally, has proven
Peugeot’s toughness and perfor-

rally outright as well as the teams’
event. Peugeot continually beats all
comers, irrespective of price yet it
sells for only £1,275. At this price it's
not common sense to settle for the
car “everyone” drives when you can
own a Peugeot! Peugeot quality shows
in extra performance, extra road
holding ability, extra braking effici-
ency, lay back seats and trim and
finish that is straight, no gimmick

are previous Peugeot owners. They

The Bulletin
VOL. 88, No. 4525
NOVEMBER 26, 1966
The Mad Mad World
of Arthur Calwell
WERE a most fantastic turn of
events to occur, and a
Labor Government actually be
elected on November 26, it would
be reasonable to say that we
damned well deserved everything
we got, for if the election cam-
paign has done anything it has
shown up the alternatives as
starkly as they could conceivably
be presented. Mr. Calwell in
particular has performed a signal
service, if not to his Party or to
himself, certainly to the voters:
without sophistry, equivocation,
or the slightest smattering of
Public Relations, he has presented
the Labor Party for what it is.
And what it is in its current
mood is utterly childish. It offers
a program which could only be
lived out in the fantasy world of
the ALP’s imagination. Everything
is so simple in the ALP world.
Prices go up, your Labor Govern-
ment steps in and controls them.
Interest rates are high, you lower
them. There is land “speculation,”
you eliminate it. Most other prob-
lems are solved by establishing
things with stirring capital letters:
a National Fuel Policy, a Balanced
Development Fund, an Australian
Shipping Line, a National Plan
for Aborigines. Foreign investment
is quite simply dealt with by
Restriction and Regulation. As for
the “dirty little war” in Vietnam,
you pull out. Conscripts, you dis-
charge. This is called an Indepen-
dent Foreign Policy. In that world
evil ogres exist, posing a menace
which must be defeated: a belli-
cose Harold Holt (with spear-
gun?), a heartless ministry which
recklessly squanders the lives of
others’ children. (For its recrea-
tion, presumably.)
Perhaps we should spell these
things out: in the real world no
government can increase its ex-
penditure in 61 different directions,
increase the tax burden imme-
diately by 25 percent, put under
way eleven major inquiries and
establish nineteen new government
agencies-—especially not a govern-
ment in which the only men with
ministerial experience are in their
70s, and in which there are deep
and regular recurring internal dis-
sensions. Quite obviously, Mr. Cal-
well in the desperation of his last
fling, is gambling everything on a
massive act of wishful thinking by
the electorate. Taken bit by bit,
many of his offers seem attractive,
and there is something for every-
one. But in sum they add up to
madness —and there is a certain
danger that through self-delusion
some people may not see the luna-
tic wood for the attractive trees.
M R . HOLT has been far too
generous in his assessment of
the Labor Party. Even he is de-
ceived, if he seriously believes (and
he said this in his policy speech)
that it is only the “extremists” in
the ALP who attack the American
alliance and all the rest. The point
is that extremists predominate.
The outright leftists have been
joined by the Frasers and the Cal-
wells in their ranting against the
U.S. As for Mr. Whitlam, despite
his boy-scoutish talk about civil
aid, Labor Party policy on Viet-
nam remains that of the notorious
May 12 statement, which called
for capitulation by the free world
in four easy stages. Its slogan: All
Along with the Viet Cong.
Labor would have the Ameri-
cans abandon 14,000,000 Viet-
namese to a regime which has ad-
mitted executing “too many in-
nocent people.” It would have
them abandon the noble (and for
us truly vital) principle of helping
small nations against aggression
and leave other people to the bully-
ing mercies of the Fascists of the
mid-Twentieth Century. Not only
would it shatter the whole basis
of foreign policy by giving up the
effort to keep neighboring coun-
tries in the hands of fairly peace-
able, sane governments, it would
also destroy any hope we may have
of achieving even a small measure
of self-sufficiency in defence.
Although Communist China has
nuclear bombs and is rapidly de-
veloping missiles, Mr. Cal well
blandly says that Australia is
spending “too much money on
expensive, sophisticated defence
equipment.” The Chinese for all
their noisy heroic talk about the
simple guerilla are not so stupid
as to think that the best in military
technology should not be striven
for. Prime Minister Calwell, in
happily giving orders that all con-
scripts be immediately discharged,
would leave Australia with exactly
five battalions of combat troops,
with two, perhaps three, available
at any time for fighting. Heaven
knows, and every foreign Defence
Department knows, we are even
now pitifully weak in military
numbers despite national service
on the present small scale.
Mr. Calwell would like to see
Australia a cosy little isolated
British community, without
people from continental Europe,
let alone any other fearful regions.
This is the dream of a very old
man, living in the Australia he
knew before his days as Minister
for Immigration a quarter of a
century ago. A harmless enough
dream, perhaps, but to dream of
an Asia from which we can dis-
engage and isolate ourselves is in


fact very dangerous in a person
with aspirations to power. It
would be so nice to believe we
could leave “Asians” to settle
“Asian affairs”; so nice to believe
that Communist aggression was
civil war and spontaneous peasant
protest against injustice; so com-
fortable to sit back in the confident
belief that militancy appeased
would mellow and expansionism
turn to introversion; so much
easier on the conscience not to
have to send our boys to risk their
limbs and lives.
Yet the fact that the Opposition
Party thinks it worthwhile gambl-
ing on such delusional alternatives
is itself one of the most damning
reflections of the Government’s
past failure to tell the people the
facts of Australia’s international
life in the mid-’5 Os. Belatedly there
has been an attempt at a crash
education program. We hope, on
the basis of the fundamental good
sense of most Australians, that it
is enough to let the Government
muddle through again. Victory
for the Government on November
26 will leave many drastic prob-
lems, but a defeat for it would be
unthinkable.

THIS AUSTRALIA
Entering the Dirty Phase
From ALAN REID
travelling with Harold Holt
With one mild exception, Prime Minister Harold Holt has not referred to
Communism in the present election campaign in other than the policy sense*
He says quite frankly that he is
fighting the campaign on the south-
ward thrust of Communism in South-
East Asia. But not once has he branded
as a Communist or Communist sym-
pathiser an opponent who does not
share his belief that the future of Aus-
tralia and the lives of future genera-
tions of Australians will be pro-
foundly affected by the electoral deci-
sion that has to be made on November
26 on this issue. To him, they are
misguided, mistaken, and myopic, but
not malevolent.
By now, Menzies would have estab-
lished his subjects Vietnam, defence,
and international Communism. Any-
one who ventured to disagree with
him would be a Communist, a Com-
munist fellow-traveller, or a wide-eyed
innocent who, through lack of intelli-
gence, had succumbed to the attraction
of Communist propaganda on these
issues. With an eyebrow shooting aloft
like a Skybolt, he would be engaged
in carving large, often cruel, strips off
the hide of his political opponents with
his razor tongue.
Holt, on the other hand, has the
approach that he is dealing with
reasonable people. He wants to con-
vert them back to ‘What he considers
right thinking. It is an interesting
change in campaign techniques and it
will be interesting to see how the results
work out.
Only once during the present cam-
paign has Holt (so far) called his num-
erous hecklers Communists. And even
then he had justification. This hap-
pened at the Melbourne meeting 1 in the
electorate of Yarra, held by Dr. Jim
Cairns for Labor. In this electorate, a
young Liberal, Leo Hawkins, is making
a most colorful bid to make an impact
in a Labor citadel where Cairns has an
almost fanatical following. What
Hawkins is like as a politician I do-
not know. But he attracted more youth
—and it included a lot of female pul-
chritude—to his support than I have
seen at a political meeting for years.
But the Cairns supporters were equally
as well organised, and the meeting was
more in the nature of a TV spectacular
than a party rally.
Holt, shouting almost despairingly
into a babble of noise which emanated
from mouth-organs, hooters, rattles, and
other mechanical devices as often as
from unaided human effort, produced a
copy of the organ of the Eureka Youth
League, the Communist Party’s young
people’s organisation. Holt pointed out
that this particular publication had
urged members of the Eureka Youth
League to attend his rally in force and
to demonstrate their feelings. It was
clear that some of the demonstrators
were EYL members young Com-
munists. “Smearer,” yelled an in-
ter jector. “I don’t think I am,” said
Holt, mildly. “Surely if you stand for
Communism, you’re not ashamed to say
so. And surely I’m entitled to point it
out.”
Question time at this meeting, as at
others, revealed Holt at his best.. Where
Menzies would have given the right to
ask questions to obvious Government
supporters (who asked him the kind of
stooge questions that enabled him to
flay his opponents), Holt insists on call-
ing upon those members of his audi-
ence who are clearly opponents. His:
politeness is impeccable and his good
humor impenetrable. When his own
supporters try to shout down a hostile
questioner he says: “Fair go he’s
entitled to ask what he wants.” When
the questioner asks what Menzies would
regard as a “stinker,” Holt says with-
out the slightest suggestion of sarcasm,.
“That’s a fair question and you are
entitled to a fair answer.”
• Where Menzies, who realised that he
had to conserve his voice if he was


going to see out the strain of talking
constantly during an Australia-wide
campaign, would accept only a few
questions and then brusquely indicate
“No more,” Holt will stay good-
naturedly on the platform, accepting
friendly, hostile, intelligent, and stupid
questions with equal courtesy. No
matter how hostile the question, he will
repeat the substance of it so that any-
one in the audience who did not hear
will get its gist before he gives his own
reply.
His equanimity is enormous. He
never seems to get ruffled. He has
none of Menzies’ superb platform tricks.
He does not put his hand to his ear
theatrically as Menzies did with per-
sistent interjectors to persuade the
audience into quietening down, seem-
ingly to hear the interjector, whereas
all Menzies wanted was quietness in
which to continue his own speech. But
he has an attractive doggedness that
usually secures him a hearing.
Now in its final week, the campaign
appears to be moving into the “dirty”
stage. Calwell has now involved Holt’s
three stepsons. He has pointed out that
while their stepfather is prepared to
conscript other men’s sons for service
in Vietnam, they are not involved.
Holt has undoubtedly attacked Cal-
well quite ferociously. But (up to the
time of writing) these attacks had been
within a political context. Calwell,
Holt charged, had made “fraudulent”
use of the views of the Pope and the
late President Kennedy when the ALP
claimed that their views supported
Labor’s attitude on Vietnam. (It is
interesting that since then Calwell has
not again put forward Kennedy as
holding the same views as Labor on
the Vietnam issues.) In Melbourne,
the Roman Catholic auxiliary docu-
mented the Pope’s views, and Holt
has drawn public attention to this.
Holt has also described Calwell’s policy
speech promises as sufficiently “fraudu-
lent” as to bring their author before a
judicial tribunal if he were making
the same claim in a prospectus on
behalf of a private company.
But Holt has not attacked Calwell
in the personal as distinct from the
political sense. It will be a pity if
the election is influenced by some con-
sideration about Holt’s stepsons when
the basic question that the electorate
has to resolve is whether it is in the
nation’s best interests to be represented
militarily in South Vietnam and
whether the Australia-United States
defence alliances will or will not be
adversely affected if Labor’s policies
for withdrawal first of National Ser-
vicemen and later of all Australian
forces from Vietnam are implemented.

On the Labor Trail
From BOB BAUDINO
travelling with Arthur Calwell
“I am a very old hand at this game. I have been talking on platforms for the
past 50 years.”
The unintentionally invited retort came back through the lowered guard of
the Calwell political facade. “You’re an old man. You have been there too
long and you have learnt nothing.”
The author of the latter statement,
a long-haired university student sitting
in the balcony of Hobart’s tiny Play-
house Theatre, one of 40 bent on
making as much noise as possible,
probably still does not realise how tell-
ing a blow he landed. For the health
of 70-year-old Arthur Calwell was the
hidden factor of this election campaign,
almost certainly his last.
Arthur Calwell’s greatest test of his
election campaign, now at the half-way
mark, is to survive doubts about his
physical ability to match his 70 years

and the demands of a tight schedule,
often involving two public meetings,
TV and Press interviews, and small
fund-raising gatherings (mostly merely
to receive a union cheque to bolster
Labor’s sorely depleted coffers), all in
one day. So far Calwell has stood up
well.
He was a little tired in Hobart (he
appeared to be so close to dozing off
on the chintz lounge of the drawing-
room setting on stage that one heckler
produced considerable blinking from
him by calling “Wake up, Arthur”),
but so were a lot of much younger
people who had risen at six a.m. in
Melbourne to catch the aircraft to
Hobart, and they did not have to meet
Labor officials when they arrived.
As the campaign went into its final
week Calwell was looking a little
greyer, and his cheeks were a little
puffier, but he was still going strongly.
Labor officials in all cities are sen-
sitive about his condition they are
quick to say how well he looks, what
marvellous condition he is in for a
man of 70, but they react sharply,
sometimes almost aggressively, if any-
one suggests he is a “little off.”
Mr. Calwell, although he is not
admitting it, is also watching his
health. He has a staunch ally, his wife,
travelling with him for the full elec-
tion tour for the first time. He goes
to bed as soon as he can after meet-
ings, is eating well, and is not pushing
himself at meetings. Overall he is
mounting a quiet campaign. The
table-thumping, fist-waving Calwell of
old is not present this time. Nor is
the man who stomped around Austra-
lia in the 1963 campaign handing out
major development promises at nearly
every stop.
But he is still scoring off the inter-
jectors as he said, he is an old
hand and is constantly telling the
noisy banner-waving groups that he
has a form in his pocket for them if
they want to volunteer for Vietnam.
A colorful, entertaining speaker “off
the cuff,” Calwell is using prepared
scripts. But he is still scoring best on
the few occasions he is deviating from
copy.
In Sydney he told his Fivedock RSL
hall audience he did not want Billy
McMahon’s scalp, somebody had
beaten him to it. In Hobart he told
one of his young irritants needling him
on conscription, “We say young men
of military age in favor of conscrip-
tion should have at least the guts to
volunteer to go and do a bit of fight-
ing themselves.” This was a glimpse
of the Calwell the Labor stalwarts
knew and loved, and they showed it
with a standing ovation. All Calwell
meetings have been, numerically at
least, strong.
Apart from Hobart’s they have been
overwhelmingly enthusiastic. On the
mainland, Labor meetings have been
notably one-sided all but the most
determined inter jectors have seldom
managed more than one thrust before
being intimidated, in most cases, by
remarkably well-proportioned Labor
ushers.
It was in Melbourne, his home
ground, that Calwell turned in his best
performance. Speaking twice in the
same evening on November 16, at
meetings one hour apart in time and
five miles in distance at the North-
cote Town Hall (as Calwell described
it “in the Labor end of Batman”)
and at Moonee Ponds Town Hall (in
Maribyrnong)—he turned in his worst
and best performance of the tour.
In Batman he stuck to prepared copy.
(ALP Federal Secretary Cyril Wynd-
ham has insisted Calwell have a pre-
pared speech every .meeting.) He turned
in a flat, dreary dialogue that wandered
Face of the Week
Quiet confidence seemed the key-
note of Prime Minister Holt’s cam-
paigning during the. week before
the elections, while Opposition
Leader Calwell took the honors for
old-style panache, including a per-
sonal attack on the Holt family.
Both leaders had noisy rallies in all
capitals, the main issues being con-
scription for Vietnam and the cost-
ing of Mr. Calwell’s election prom-
ises. Highlights of the week were
the ALP’s decision to give most
second preferences to the DLP;
a “how to vote” directive to
white-collar unions was rejected
by many of them; the RSL asked
all 454 candidates their views on its
“better, war pensions” policy; and
one of Mr. Calwell’s opponents in
the Melbourne electorate sought to
have him barred under two items of
the Constitution because he is a
Papal Knight.

Anatomy of Warringah
By SAM LIPSKI
At one a.m. last Saturday morning, after an application made at midnight, Mr.
Justice McLelland of the Supreme Court of New South Wales issued an injunction
preventing the distribution of the November 19 issue of the Mosman “Daily News-
Pictorial.” The issue carried an advertising supplement of election propaganda put
out by the Independent Liberal candidate for Warringah, Mr. Keith Chambers,
and attacking the endorsed Liberal candidate, Mr. Edward St. John, QC.
This was the dramatic climax to an
election campaign which for sheer
bitterness is probably unprecedent-
ed in a post-war Federal electorate. Yet
what makes Warringah special is not
the violence of the campaign. What we
are seeing in Warringah is nothing less
than the emergence of the extremist-
Right as a force in Australian politics.
Nationally, it is still marginal. But
some time on Saturday night we might
know if the extremist-Right, which is
supporting Mr. Chambers, can be more
than a marginal political force when it
chooses to concentrate its growing
resources on one electorate.
Some of the extremists have accused
St. John of being a Communist, an
undercover Communist, a “do-gooder,”
an “infiltrator of high places.” He has
been likened to Lenin, Ho Chi Minh,
and Karl Marx (never Stalin); he has
been described as a “muzzier of the
Press.” THE BULLETIN is satisfied
that alf the charges made against St.
John by the extremist-Right, especially
those which in any way suggest that he
is anything but an uncompromising
anti-Communist, -are completely with-
out foundation. (THE BULLETIN
cannot make any comment on Mr.
Chambers’ supplement which is the
subject of the proceedings in the Syd-
ney Equity Court.)
The extremist-Right is reported not
to be confident of its chance of defeat-
ing Mr. St. John in the blue-ribbon
Liberal seat of Warringah. Two ques-
tions then: why are the extremist-Right
interested in Warringah? How have
they OQAunted their first election cam-
paign injAustralia?
First, why Warringah? Or, more
correctly, why St. John? The simple
answer is because he actively opposes
and condemns the apartheid policy of
the South African Government at the
same time as being an uncompromising
opponent of Communism. The
extremist-Right realised some time ago
that if he got into Parliament he would
be something novel in the Liberal
Party rooms an eloquent, informed,
and distinguished voice against apar-
theid. This was a real challenge to the
extremist-Right, and, as THE BULLE-
TIN reported on September 24, the
“Stop St. John Movement” was their
response. The second question is: how
have they gone about it?
In the Warringah campaign there
have been main interlocking
groups who have supplied most of the
organisation and propaganda to cam-
paign against St. John. First there has
been the “Australian International News
Saint Joan of Warringah
Review” group, consisting of the editor
Mr. Henry Fischer and his supporters.
The second group has been the “Fifty
Club,” a social-political club at 50 Vic-
toria Street, Kings Cross, Sydney.
Formed some three months ago, the
“Fifty Club” originally tried to set
themselves up as the Kings Cross
branch of the Liberal Party, but were
refused permission to call themselves a
branch by the Liberal Party State
Executive. Fischer is a member, and
the president is Mr. L. Urbanchich,
who attacked St. John at a Liberal
Party series of lectures on Communism
earlier this year. (Mr. Eric D. Butler,
president of the racist League of
Rights, a Melbourne-based organisation,
was the first speaker at the “Fifty
Club,” and Sir Raphael Cilento, who
has been an outspoken defender of
apartheid and racial purity, is the
club’s patron. Sir Raphael has
attacked St. John publicly and had
to apologise).
Like guerilla warfare there are
three phases in their campaign. Phase
1 was the campaign to prevent St.
John from getting pre-selection. Henry
Fischer worked actively within the
Liberal Party (he is the President of
the Beauty Point branch of the Party
in the Warringah electorate) to stress
St. John’s association with the South
Africa Defence and Aid Fund.
But St. John won the pre-selection
and Phase 2 began very quickly after-
wards. A matter of four days after
St. John’s success in the pre-selection
ballot the newspaper which circulates
in Warringah, the Mosman “Daily
News-Pictorial,” announced that “an
influential group of Mosman residents”
was considering supporting an Inde-

for all

Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why

pleasantly surprised.
pendent Liberal candidate. The reason
given was that Mr. St. John was not
really interested in Iqg#l affairs and
was “too controversial.” In fact, as the
rest of the statement made clear, the
“influential group of Mosman resi-
dents” were really concerned about St.
John’s opposition to apartheid. (8.,
,Oct. 8.)
Three weeks later Mr. Keith Cham-
bers announced that he would resign
from the Liberal Party to stand as an
Independent Liberal. A real estate
agent and a former Mayor of Mosman,
Chambers had previously stood unsuc-
cessfully for pre-selection in the State
seat of Manly and had made his speech
to the committee on the problems of
the wool industry. Chambers has
strongly denied that the extremist-
Right is organising his campaign or
that they are writing his speeches

Last yveek Chambers and St. John
confronted each other in public debate
for the first time in the campaign at
a meeting of Mosman Apex Club. I
have never attended a political meet-
ing quite like it. Chambers’ speech was
a diatribe against St. John. Some of
the more remarkable excerpts:
• St. John’s policy of “outright hos-
tility to a friendly and loyal ally (South
Africa) in the world confrontation with
Communism is incompatible with
Liberal Party philosophy.”
• St. John serves the overall world
strategy of Communism.
• He associates with “persons and
organisations known to be Left Wing
in sympathy. Two of his close asso-
ciates have recently been in North
Vietnam and have come back loud in
their praises of Ho Chi Minh and
his regime.” As a check of Chambers’
prepared text reveals there was no
intention of naming these two “close a
associates.” But St. John interrupted
Chambers and said, “Name them, Mr.
Chambers. Name them.” Chambers
replied “Francis James and Morris
West.” I later approached Chambers
and asked him when Morris West had
been in North Vietnam. (He has never
been there.) Chambers told me—“No,
I meant someone else whose name I’ve
just forgotten but I can get it for
you.”
Nearly every one of Chambers’
charges against St. John, some of
which have been denied and refuted
half-a-dozen times already by St. John,
have been made by extremists or
by the letter-writers to the local news-
paper, the Mosman “Daily News-
Pictorial.”
The meeting at the Apex Club
yielded much more concrete evidence
of links between Chambers and the
extremist-Right. Speaking with some
passion (“So much for that smear!”),
St. John literally put Chambers in the
witness-box and cross-examined him.
Chambers admitted that he knew both
Fischer and Urbanchich, that he had
attended a meeting of “The Fifty
Club” on the night of October 22,
which was the night following the
announcement of candidature, that he
was receiving the support of Urban-
chich and “The Fifty Club” in the
campaign, that he had been to the
offices of the “Australian International
News Review,” that a photograph of
him posing with Aborigine George
Bracken which appeared in the Mos-
man “Daily News-Pictorial” on No-
vember 3 had been taken at the “News
Review” office, and that he had met
Fischer there.
In fact, the story which appeared
in the Mosman “Daily News-Pictorial”
as a result of his being photographed
with George Bracken turned out to
be unfounded. Bracken, reported as
supporting Chambers, has denied that
he supports Chambers or that he ever
said that he would. He has now
severed his relation with the “News
Review,” for which he has written
some articles in the past.
The campaign has not only pro-
ceeded at the level of personal attacks
and letters to the local newspaper. It

has also been an intensely waged
political manoeuvre which suggests
that the extremist-Right are not just
a few individuals with fantastic ideas.
First, they have stacked the Beauty
Point branch of the Liberal Party with
some 20 new members, all known to
be sympathetic to apartheid and many
of whom are “Fifty Club” members.
Secondly, and perhaps even more
importantly in Warringah, they have
spent a great deal of time and energy
on DLP members and supporters. One
of them approached the DLP and
asked the Party not to run a candidate
in Warringah. This was done in the
hope that if there were no DLP candi-
date, many DLP members could be
persuaded to accept Chambers. The
DLP refused. The tactics of the
extremists were switched. If the DLP
did run a candidate, could they avoid
campaigning and leave the field to
the pro-Chambers supporters? Again
the DLP refused.
So the campaign was directed to
individual members of the DLP. Here
they partially succeeded. The War-
ringah Electoral Council of the
recommended to the N.S.W. State;
Executive that the preferences of tlji£
DLP should not go first to St. John
but to Chambers. At the meeting,
where this recommendation was passed
by a majority of about 2 to 1, one
DLP member whose particular concern
is clean literature violently attacked
St. John as a pornographer (the
“Oz” case). Another active anti-
Communist said he was pro-Left and
did not support the Government on,
Vietnam. Senior officials of the DLP,
told of the accusations, were shocked.
At -the meeting itself the State Presi-
dent of the DLP, Mr. K. Davis,
strongly defended St. John as a dedi-
cated anti-Communist and a supporter
of the Government’s Vietnam policy.
The recommendation nevertheless was
passed. State Executive has rejected it
and the DLP has instructed its voters to
give St. John No. 2 on the ballot. (DLP
members in Moreton, Queensland, do
not want to give their preferences (to
Mr. J. Killen—on the far Right of the
Liberal Party—because they regard him
as too reactionary.)
The campaign, however, is not really
directed at helping Chambers to win
the election. It is mainly an attempt
to lessen St. John’s majority in
comparison with previous Liberal
candidates. The problem for the
extremist-Right is that St. John might
not stay on the back benches for very ( .
long. Some of his colleagues feel
Territories, External Affairs, Attorney-'
General’s are all possible portfolios for
him in the future very sensitive ones
as far as the extremist-Right is con-
cerned. So if he cannot be beaten,
perhaps he can be neutralised as
“doubtful”. When St. John wins, stage 3
will, therefore, continue.

The Voting and After
By PETER SAMUEL
An ordinary cynical citizen might well imagine that after 17 years as the
major partner in the Coalition Government the Liberal Party would be going to
the polls with things rigged at least a little its way.
In fact the distribution of electorates
and the position of boundaries are
Badly against the Liberals. In the
sprawling south-eastern part of Mel-
bourne 119,432 voters will go to the
polls on Saturday to decide whether
to return their sitting Member, Mr.
Snedden. Far fewer people, 96,822 to
Be precise, will in the inner northern
suburbs go along to the booths in three
separate electorates to determine the
futures of Messrs. Calwell, Crean, and
Claims.
That is, of course, an extreme
example. But it is a fact that Liberal
Party members have things stacked
against them. That statistical fellow,
the average Liberal Member, holds a
seat with 53,450 voters on the rolls,
while his Labor colleague needs only
48,780. Country Party representatives,
of course, do even better, existing on
seats with an average enrolment of
45,300. But the advantage of the
Country Party Members does not swing
things far enough to give the Coalition
Government the equivalent of Labor’s
present deal. The average Govfcrnment-
Beld electorate is over 51,000, four per-
cent larger than Labor’s.
The advantage Labor has in the
coming elections is even more striking
at the margin. A general swing of three
percent the Government’s way means
a gain of only four seats; a similar
swing Labor’s way means for them a
gain of eight seats. A swing to the
Government of four percent would
mean the ousting of seven Labor Mem-
bers; a similar swing Labor’s way
would net it 12 extra seats and put
it into power. So if ever there is an
“Voters, may I introduce myself. My name is ... er ...r. .."
opportunity for the ALP to make full
use of the electoral system it is this
weekend. The electoral arithmetic is
all Labor’s way.
But it won’t stay like that. The exist-
ing electoral map is an old one* drawn
in 1955. In the last decade there have
been two trends at work: embour-
geoisement and suburbanisation. Outer
Melbourne suburbs like Springvale and
Mount Waverley and Dandenong have
taken the mass of migrants from
■ overseas, as well as a good number of
young people from country areas who
work in modern industry and commute
to city jobs, while the inner suburbs
around Melbourne stagnate and even
decline.
Yet electoral boundaries have not
been adjusted to reflect all this. But
they will have to be soon. Already the
Parliament’s failure to do so has been
challenged in court; true, sq~ far only
by a law student at the Australian Nat-
ional Llniversity wanting a novel way
of getting out of a parking fine. But
there is a very real danger that a
serious, well-financed litigant might
succeed in challenging the constitu-
tional validity of the 1966 Parliament
on account of its grossly obsolete dis-
tribution of seats.
In any case, the self-interest of the
Liberals must force a modernisation
before the 1969 elections. The inter-
esting thing then is to see what may
happen to the state of the parties as
a result of such a redistribution.
For at least a year now politicians
and commentators of all complexions
have been saying that the next redistri-

In N.S.W. in conjunction with ALBERT P. BARNCASTLE PTY. LTD., SYDNEY
bution will certainly favor the Country
Party. This is quite fallacious. The
Country Party is much more likely
to actually lose a seat by redistribution.
The latest population statistics and the
Commonwealth Electoral Officer’s
latest figures of enrolments show that
unless the House of Representatives is
enlarged, N.S.W. must lose one seat by
redistribution. And that seat will almost
certainly be a rural seat, for to retain
the present number of rural seats they
would have to all be brought intoler-
ably close to the legal minimum size.
Labor stands to lose most heavily
by a redistribution. In Sydney’s inner
suburbs five safe Labor seats are bound
to be converted into three seats. East
Sydney, West Sydney, Dailey, Graynd-
ler, and Watson are all down to about
60 percent of their necessary strength.
Melbourne’s inner areas are even more
deserted. Melbourne, Melbourne Ports,
Yarra, and Scullin are all around 50
percent of the quota, so it is very likely
that the four will be merged into two
—ousting two more entrenched ALP
men.
The Liberals, on the other hand,
seem likely to lose a seat in both Mel-
bourne and Sydney through the con-
solidation of the middle suburb seats
—Fawkner, Isaacs, Balaclava in Mel-
bourne, and the southside Sydney seats
of Lowe, Evans, Parkes, and St. George.
Moving out farther from the metro-
politan centres to the 10- to 20-mile
away suburbs, the Liberals will get their
big gains—at least one extra north of
Sydney Harbor, and as many as three
more in the east and south-east of
Melbourne.
The other States are unlikely to see
any changes directly attributable to re-
distribution, except S.A., where rapid
industrial expansion to the north of
Adelaide and at Elizabeth will enable
two Labor seats to be carved out of
Bonython.
The sum result of all this is that a
fair redistribution would on the same
voting pattern give the Liberal Party
an extra five seats, putting 57 in the
House, take out five ALP from the
present 53, and reduce the Country
Party from 19 to 18.
£JOME will say, of course, that the
next redistribution will not be fair,
and that the Country Party will be able
to gain especially favorable treatment.
This seems most unlikely. Its elec-
torates are already likely to be fairly
close to the 80 percent floor below
which the legislation does not allow
any seat to fall. And under the amended
Act the Electoral Commissioners are
much less liable to be influenced. From
how on all submissions will be
publicly, so that the Commissioners
will have to follow something of a
middle path if they are to avoid
charges of favoritism.
So by redistribution the Country
Party will lose at least one of its 19
seats. Next weekend it could lose Hume
in N.S.W. to Labor, and Canning in
W.A. to the Liberals. At the next elec-
tions it will be very vulnerable in three-
cornered contests which seem likely to
occur in seats like McPherson (which
takes in the Gold Coast and southern
Brisbane suburbs), Coorangamite, Indi,
and Wimmera in Victoria, and Moore
in W.A.
Its greatest strength of all in the
person of Mr. McEwen seems certain
to retire from the political scene quite
soon. (Some people predict within a
year.) And then the key Department
of Trade and Industry will be open,
and certainly not for another Country
Party man. Mr. Leslie Bury would
most probably be given the position.
There is talk, too, in Canberra of
Mr. Hasluck resigning from Parlia-
ment. He probably does not much like
the Prime Minister involving himself
so deeply in foreign policy matters, and
if this one were to happen there would
be room for another chain of changes
in Cabinet. Fairhall to External Affairs,
Gorton to Defence, and so on.
But, of course, all this might be upset
if the Liberals’ neglect of redistribu-
tion were to catch up with them next
weekend, and Labor to fluke in on the
crazy electoral arithmetic which at
present prevails. Otherwise there could
be a Liberal Government facing small
opposition Country and Labor parties:
in 1970.

Trials of William White
In the Courts of Conscience
By MONTY DENNISON
AN electric fan overhead muffled
the rat-a-tat of pneumatic drills
outside Sydney’s Special Court of
Petty Sessions. Sunshine streamed
through cracks around the drawn
Venetian blinds on to the light green
walls and highly polished linoleum
floor. A clerk flipped through papers
at the large wooden table from which
the barristers address the court.
An ordinary-looking courtroom, one
which might be found in any city or
State. Yet in this room takes place one
of the most delicate of all legal opera-
tions: the examination of conscience.
It is the room to which virtually all
young men in Sydney must come if
they seek exemption from National
Service as conscientious objectors. It is
here that one of these men, Wil-
liam Phillip Orrick White, 21, of 45
Wharf Road, Gladesville, began his
legal fight last December to prove his
claim. It is here, almost a year later,
that White again appeared last week.
Having failed to prove to the satisfac-
tion of the court that his conscience
was what he said it was, he pleaded
guilty to failing to report for his call-
up and was turned over to military
authorities.
As White left the courtroom, all but
a few spectators in the rear of the room
followed. Some slapped him on the
back, others shook his hand, one woman
hugged him. White’s fiancee, Miss
Claire Seale, 21, of Como, also a
schoolteacher, wept. Outside the court
in the narrow hallway, reporters and
friends crowded around White as he
disobeyed his first military order to
agree to report to South Head Signal,
Watson’s Bay, the next day.
“I order you to,” said Major H. J.
Moran, commanding officer of the
First Personnel Depot, Watson’s Bay.
“I refuse to,” White replied. “I’m your
commanding officer, and I order you
to report,” Major Moran repeated.
“And I still refuse,” White said. With
a flushed face, Major Moran turned
and went to the lift.
On the footpath outside about 30
men and women held placards bearing
legends:. “Teachers in Schools, Not in
Jails,” “White is Right,” “We Salute
a Brave Man,” “How Does Killing
Differ from Murder?” Several people
shouted “Hip Hip Hooray” three times.
Others handed out leaflets protesting
White’s induction into the Army.
White is not a martyr. He is a sin-
cere, intelligent, clean-cut, modest
young, man with the courage of his
convictions. Throughout his life, he
has had an intense compassion for any
form of suffering. No photograph can
capture the tense clasping and un-
clasping of the hands, the rubbing of
the forehead, or the heavy load which
he obviously bears.
Here is a man who arouses your
empathy. You feel for him as you
realise he has had to subject his in-
most beliefs, his conscience, to the
coldest public scrutiny. He has had to
support his thinking as few people are
ever called upon to do. You ask how
it is possible the court could doubt
his sincerity.
It would have been easy for White
to have given up. He could have re-
nounced his conscience, gone into the
Army last July 18 as instructed, and
possibly become a teacher in the
Education Corps. He could have mar-
ried in December as planned. In two
years, his military obligation would
have been completed and he would
have come out of the Army a teacher
with four years’ standing, and his bond
completed.
But White is not a coward. He is
determined not to give up his stand:
that killing is wrong, that war is
wrong, and that he cannot take part in
any organisation whose purpose is to
kill. “I’ve done a lot of self-criticism
since this began,” White said, placing
firm tanned hands on his knees. “I’ve
felt doubts about whether the impli-
cations of the stand are worthwhile.
But I always revert to the fact that I
cannot with a clear conscience take
part in military activity of any form.”
White’s struggle to prove his con-
science began eleven months ago.
Since then, he has taken his case un-
successfully to three courts, been dis-
missed from his position as a school-
teacher, been prevented from taking
any other employment, been driven to
the verge of bankruptcy, and been
forced to postpone his marriage indefi-
nitely.
And White’s trials are not yet over.
He is now officially in the Army and
has disobeyed his first order. Undoubt-
edly he will disobey other orders and
become liable for military punishment.
In the modern Court of Conscience
(known as the Special Court of Petty
Sessions), it is the responsibility of the
objector to prove his claims. It helps
if the claimant’s religion prohibits him
from taking part in military activities
and if he is a known member of a
pacifist organisation. The magistrate
attempts to probe a claimant’s inward
conviction of what is morally right and
wrong, whether the conviction is genu-
ine and reached after some process of
thinking, and whether the claimant
will act according to his belief regard-
less of any personal disadvantage.
White did not have an easy task.
He was not a regular church attendant,
not a member of a peace movement,
and had reached his views independent-
ly of early training. He also sought
complete exemption from noncombat-
ant as well as from combatant duties.

When he appeared before Mr. C. S.
Rodgers, SM, on December 20, 1965.
he said: “My beliefs are such that
they do not allow me to engage in
any form ot miltary service, combatant
or noncombatant ... I believe that
every man has a right to live a full
life and anything which is likely to
take away this right to live, that is,
any form of killing, is unalterably
wrong.”
During the hearing, White was cross-
examined by Mr. G. Halliday, for the
Commonwealth Crown Solicitor.
Question: “If an enemy were to
invade Australia and come to the
school where you teach, would you
deem it worthwhile to help to protect
those children?” Answer: “I don’t see
there would be anything you could do
to protect them negotiate with the
enemy.” Question: “Do you think an
army doctor or an army nurse is con-
doning killing when they join a mili-
tary organisation?” Answer: “Yes.”
Question: “If the enemy were attack-
ing your home and about to attack
your mother and father would you
take any steps at all?” Answer: “Under
the circumstances I think it would be
useless to attempt to defend them.”
The magistrate was not fully con-
vinced that White’s conscience was
what he said it was. He found that
White “might have a belief against the
killing of man.” However, he said, he
could not accept that White’s beliefs
would keep him from taking part in
an “Education Corps attached to the
military machine or to belong to any
other military noncombatant unit.”
White lodged an appeal in the Dis-
trict Court before Judge Cameron-
Smith on March 21, 1966.
EXPLAINING the origins of his cons-
cience, White told the Court that
as a child he once killed a sparrow with
a catapult. “I think it brought to me
for the first time at that early age that
each one of us is responsible for death.
I never used a catapult after that.”
His Honor placed great emphasis on
the fact that White was unsure of the
date conscription was re-introduced.
“. . . One \yould perhaps be inclined
to the thought that an action such as
this would be one which would be
firmly fixed in your mind as being a
black day in your life, and in the lives
of many other tens of thousands of
people.”
The Judge also asked: “How can
you account, in your belief, for a per-
son such as Hitler?” Answer: “I think,
firstly, that there is aggressiveness in
man. I do not think it is a war
aggressiveness. I think it is a psycho-
logical need to exert your own ideas.”
Question: “Hitler asserted his ideas
of aggressiveness?” Answer: “Can I
just continue, Your Honor?” Question:
“No, you cannot. Because his aggres-
siveness took the nature and form of
wanting to assert himself as the leader
of everyone in this world. So, how
do you cope with a person such as
that, if you are not armed or trained
to defend the country?” Answer: “You
William White
create a situation where men like Hit-
ler will not have a background of
contempt for the country. You help
the country. You give the country aid.
You make a country secure in itself.”
His Honor then questioned White
about Hitler’s invasion of Czechoslo-
vakia, the state of Britain’s forces in
1940-41, the Napoleonic Wars, and
Vietnam. Upholding the Magistrate’s
decision, His Honor said: “. . . One
comes to the conclusion that the
thoughts and concepts which have been
developed in the mind of the appellant
are the result of ignorance rather than
good reasoning founded on learning
and logic.” White, “by and large
has presented himself, to my way of
thinking, as a person who has come
to these conclusions in a short space
of time and who has formed the con-
clusions as I have stated without a
proper basis either of learning or of
logic, or with regard to what is going
on in the world today.”
Three months later, White was
served with a call-up notice ordering
him to present himself on July 18 to
Major Moran. He telephoned the
Department of Labor and National
Service and told them he would not
report. At the same time, he notified
the Department of Education. On the
morning of July 18, he was asked
to leave his classroom at Denistone
East Primary School. Less than two
weeks later, his dismissal was author-
ised by the New South Wales Public
Service Board and his appointment as
a probationary teacher cancelled.
Jobless and unemployable (it would
be an offence under the National Ser-
vice Act to employ him), White
applied for unemployment benefits.
Instead he was given a “special relief”
of $8.25 a week the rate of an
unemployment benefit. He has con-
tinued to receive the benefit since
August. On November 9, White went
to Court for the third time. He asked
the Full High Court to find that Judge
Cameron-Smith had exceeded his
jurisdiction in confirming the Magis-
trate’s order and that an error of law
apeared in the record. But the High
Court upheld the lower courts, dis-
missed the application, and ordered
White to pay Commonwealth costs.
Fantastic as it may appear, there
is no legally established definition
for total conscientious objection. The
concept is, legally, a post-1942 one in
Australia. (Earlier, exemption from
combatant duties only was permitted.)
This leads to the question of whether
White has been treated fairly. Three
points should be made. First, the sys-
tem of determining a person’s cons-
cience is highly arbitary. There are no
guidelines for plumbing a person’s
conscience, and each magistrate or
judge is left to his own devices. He is
guided by his own experiences and pre-
dilections.
Second, there is virtually only one
court to which conscientious objector
applicants in Sydney can go, although
all courts of petty sessions are invested
with jurisdiction to deal with applica-
tions. “In the metropolitan area all go
before Mr. Rodgers . . . We’re here
and the court’s upstairs. It’s in a good
central point,"’ a man from the Crown
Solicitor’s office told me last week.
It is convenient, but is it reasonable
especially in the light of Mr. Rodgers’
strictness in granting comparatively few
exemptions? Only 15 complete exemp-
tions have been granted in New South
Wales, compared to 33 in Victoria and
28 in Queensland.
'J'HIRD, the law allows what could be
termed “judicial compromise.”
Young men can be totally or partially
exempted; they can be told to serve in
a combatant or noncombatant military
unit. Some conscientious objectors are
willing to serve in a noncombatant
role; others, like White, refuse any role
in a military organisation. A magistrate
can avoid the issue and say in effect:
“You may have the conviction you
claim, you may not. Just in case you
do, I won’t send you to a fighting unit,
but you do have to serve in a non-
combatant unit.” In White’s case the
magistrate said he “probably” felt the
“applicant might have a belief against
the killing of man. I feel that he might
be an idealist who feels that war can
result in nothing useful at all.” But
he decided he didn’t believe White’s
beliefs were such that they would not
allow him to take part in a military
noncombatant unit.
Many Australians are convinced that
justice has not been done. It is obvious
White sincerely holds his beliefs, and he
is probably going to jail because he can-
not prove them. The present system of
determining conscientious objections
should be improved. Why, for example,
could not a conscientious objection
case be heard before a jury or a small
tribunal, as in the United Kingdom
and the United States? Why could
not the findings of judges be open
to the scrutiny of appellate courts?
Why can there be no alternative
non-military service, such as teaching
in Papua-New Guinea or working with
Aborigines or helping the poor of the
cities? At least why must one man
sit in judgment on all cases of con-
science in that courtroom at 119 Phil-
lip Street, Sydney?


OVERSEAS
GENERAL MO SHE DAYAN asks
Can the Allies win
in Vietnam?
Dayan with Vietnamese vegetable sellers
ONE of the mistakes of General
Giap, the top Viet Cong mili-
tary commander, lies in his esti-
mate of the feeling in the American
Army. The American Army is not
tired and is not getting tired of the
fighting in Vietnam.
Of course there is fear in the heart
of every pilot who takes off on an
attack and of every soldier who lands
in the jungle. And of course every-
one impatiently counts the days re-
maining before he can return to his
home in the United States. But, for the
Americans, this is a comparatively light
war. It does not involve very strenuous
prolonged physical effort—troops are
flown everywhere by helicopter or
plane and do relatively little moving
on foot. The weather is much more
agreeable than winter in Europe or
Korea. Food, clothing, medical ser-
vices are first-class. The term of ser-
vice is short—only one year—and dur-
ing this period they go on leave to
places like Hong Kong, Bangkok,
Honolulu.
They never had a war with such ad-
vantages: warplanes, artillery, armor,
modern communications, aircraft
carriers, helicopter-cavalry, against an
enemy that has none. Such advantages
are not only of physical military value.
They also have a psychological impact.
They give the individual being flown in
a helicopter the feeling of superiority
In the last of three articles General
Dayan sums up the prospects for an
Allied victory in Vietnam.
over his enemy, bowed down by the
weight on his back, in the jungle.
It is possible that Washington, for
political reasons, domestic or foreign,
may decide to call a halt to the war
before achieving total victory. But
the pressure for this will not come from
the Army commanders. The American
Army as a whole, as a military body,
gets satisfaction out of every day it
spends in Vietnam. It trains its troops,
tries out its equipment, tests its com-
manders, develops its weapons, builds its
strength.
Most of the commanders, officers,
and top NCOs are regulars. They are
professionals; and I have no doubt that
these would volunteer for service in
Vietnam even if they were not posted
there. The American career soldier
wants to become expert in his “pro-
fession.” And his profession is—war.
The American generals know that
theirs is the only country which pos-
sesses a serious Expeditionary Force;
aircrft-carriers, Air Force, helicopters,
Marines, airborne units. America is to-
day the only country capable, without
any special preparations, of dispatching
a strong military force equipped with
nuclear or conventional weapons to any-
where in the world. Russia can send
missiles with nuclear warheads which
can wreak havoc among her enemies;
but she has built no carrier-vessels, and
her Army is not organised to intervene
in distant parts of the globe. The
American Army commanders see their
forces as intended for global activity,
and so the war in Vietnam is'not
strange to their thinking. It is bread
and butter to them. It is precisely for
wars in such areas that the Sixth and
Seventh Fleets were built and the Mar-
ines and Air Cavalry and airborne
forces were established. The men of
these forces do not “get tired” of the
war in Vietnam. They regard it as a
natural part of their careers, and they
are prepared to continue it for a long
time—years and years.
But the Americans also know that to
gain their purpose it is not enough to
defeat the army of Hanoi. They must
also bring the Vietnamese civilian popu-
lation to support the Government of
General Ky and convince them that an
anti-Communist regime is preferable for
them to a Viet Cong administration.
The American war is complex, and the
methods adopted in the struggle to
secure it are also diverse. The military
slogan is “search and destroy” or
search and kill,” while the civilian
motto is “to win hearts and minds.” Of
course, the combined slogans “To
search and kill and to win hearts and
minds” may sound like a tasteless
joke; but the truth is that this conflict-
ing combination expresses the American
approach to the war in Vietnam. To
win the “hearts and minds” of the Viet-
namese is also of decisive military im-
portance. The Viet Cong needs the help
or at least the passivity of the populace
for it to conduct guerilla warfare; and
conversely, Government forces will be
unable to overcome the guerillas if they
cannot rely on the support and co-
operation of the public.
General Johnson, the U.S. Army
Chief of Staff, whose visit to Vietnam
coincided with mine, invited me to din-
ner with a number of senior officers and
in the course of our discussion stressed
the special importance attaching to the
character of the military activities here.
The purpose of the war, he said, was
to bring about a situation and create
conditions in which the constitutional
government could fulfil its functions
governing and administering the
country. “How to do this? By defeating
the enemy.” He emphasised the word
“defeat” and not “destroy.” “We have
no interest in destroying the Viet Cong
troops, only in defeating them. We do
not seek to annihilate the enemy, only
to force his surrender.” I have no doubt
that General Johnson is no fervent
adherent of “search and destroy.” He
is alive to the conflict between this and
the “winning hearts” appx'oach, and
would wish to see the accent put on the
latter. *
In another observation, too, I
detected his dissatisfaction with the
nature of the current fighting. “We
have not enough information. We act
with ruthlessness, like a steamroller,
bombing extensive areas and not selected
targets based on detailed intelligence.”
Nor was he happy about the large
number of U.S. troops here. “But there
is no escape. It was essential for the
full burden of the campaign to be
borne by the American Army. , The
army of the Saigon government was not

capable of doing the job. Last year
they had already suffered some 40,000
casualties. Relative to the size of
the population, this number was
equivalent to the United States figure
of her killed in World War II
430,000.”
The “regional system” in Vietnam
also has a decisive impact on the
“character of the war” here. There
are no clearly defined front-lines in
the Vietnam campaign. The regions
which are under Government control
comprise more than 50 percent of the
population. About 25 percent are
under Viet Cong control and the rest
are “undefined.”
The attitude of the Saigon Govern-
ment, and the American, toward the
population of the Viet Cong controlled
and the undefined regions is that to-
ward a hostile people. Villages in these
regions are shelled with the aim of hit-
ting Viet Cong units, and their fields
are sabotaged by bombing and chemi-
'■ cal spraying to deny the rice crop to
the enemy. Such “hostile populations”
are not faced by questions of political
philosophy, by ideology, by “hearts and
minds.” What they face is a hard physi-
cal choice.
If they do not wish to be regarded as
enemies of the Government and become
the targets of attack, they must evacuate
their villages and abandon their pro-
perty and move to the coastal zone
which is under the control of Govern-
ment forces. The problem worrying
them is not whether they favor the
Viet Cong regime. Their problem
and it concerns almost half the popu-
lation of the country is that “going
over” to the Government side means
literally that: the physical act of fleeing
from their land and moving to refugee
camps within Saigon Government con-
trol.
Moreover, the Southern forces are not
hastening to change this geographic divi-
sion of the country into friendly and
hostile regions. The American Army
conducts operations throughout the
land; but when each is completed they
return to their bases. They do not wish
to pin down their forces and turn them
into static occupation troops, while the
Vietnamese commanders claim that with
their current limited army and budget
they are unable to assume control of
additional areas.
To see something of the civilian de-
velopment projects being carried out by
and with the help of the Americans, I
visited a refugee settlement. My Ameri-
can guide and I were accompanied by
a young Vietnamese interpreter, Tran
Dai Minh, who was born in Saigon and
spoke fluent French as well as passable
English.
We looked in first at the refugee
transit camp which held only 200
families. They live in long narrow
tin huts, one family to a room 12 by
15 feet with no partitions between the
rooms. In the centre of each room was
a wide wooden bed on which the family
ate and slept. In a corner of the kitchen
stood a coal stove and a cluster of
blackened crockery. In and around the
huts women were bent over cooking
pots and washtubs (the husbands work
in the city) and milling about were
innumerable children, bare - bottomed
and dirty.
The refugees are maintained by the
Government for six months, during
which they are expected to be moved
from the transit camp to permanent
dwellings. According to my guide, more
than 3000 families passed through this
camp in the past year. The atmosphere
in this camp was not pleasant. The
women refused to be interviewed, and
when we approached them they sul-
lenly backed away. Even the children,
who are usually bright and jolly in these
parts, looked pretty wretched, stretching
forth a begging hand while* silently fol-
lowing their mothers, their legs steeped
in mud. (The rain, as usual, poured
without a break.)
We moved on to the refugee village
settlement, a 40-minute jeep ride away.
As with all Vietnamese villages, this,
Reporting the War
too, was laid out in a rectangle. In the
centre were the community buildings,
and around them evenly spaced dwell-
ing huts, built in straight rows. We
stopped outside one hut which seemed
larger than the others. Its garden, in
which grew yams and spring beans, was
also conspicuously well tended. In the
backyard we saw two men, one old, one
younger, splitting a bamboo stejn into
thin strips with broad knives.
We approached and started talking to
them. They would be plaiting the
bamboo strips, they said, into a mat for
partitioning the kitchen from the bed-
room.
The men were father and son. The
spokesman was the son, a man of about
40, and the father merely nodded his
head from time to time in confirmation
or agreement. The younger man’s name
was Sau Phai, and he lived with his
wife and four children and his parents.
He came from the village of Nhon
Phong in the province of Binh Dinh.
He had been here in this refugee
village almost a year. Before that he
had spent three months in the transit
camp.
He fled from Nhon Phong because
of the Viet Cong. The village was in
a region within their control, and life
there became, unbearable. Not only he,
but all the inhabitants ran away except
for the cadre and those with sons serv-
ing in the Viet Cong forces. The Viet
Cong had “liberated” the village from
the Government forces four years
earlier, though he had left the village
only about a year earlier, for at the
beginning of the Viet Cong rule life
proceeded in orderly fashion. The Viet
Cong divided the land equally among
all the farmers. He, too, had received
1 mau (1 mau equals 1 hectare, equals
2-| acres) to grow rice. Before that he
held only half an acre (2 kongs),
which he put under banana plantation.
(1 kong equals one-tenth of a mau.)
The farmers were pleased with the
land distribution, for most of them in-
creased their holdings, and the fields
they worked as tenant farmers were
transferred to their ownership. Only the
rich whose property was confiscated
were disgruntled, but they were a
minority. The Viet Cong appointed an
administration to run the village, a com-
mittee of three, plus a secretary. The
committee were honest and just— not
like the previous Government officials,
who collected taxes and put the money
into their own pockets.
When he noticed my reaction, he
added—to be on the safe side—that the
officials did this against the orders of
the Government.
The Viet Cong also organised the
young men and women into Libera-
tion Youth Associations (Hoi Thanh
Nien Giai Phong), where they were
given lectures on the purposes of the
National Liberation Front and also en-
couraged to help one another. If a
farmer fell sick, or for some other rea-
son was behind with his work, he
would turn to the village committee
and members of the Youth Association
would volunteer their help in planting
his rice and weeding his fields.
But with the intensification of the
war, the Viet Cong made increasing
demands on the farmers. The village
committee received orders from the
Viet ( Cong command to raise the taxes.
They needed more money to maintain
the Army and to buy food and equip-
ment. At first the Viet Cong taxes
were the same as the Government’s—
-25 percent of the rice crop—and the
farmers would add voluntary dona-
tions. Each home had a special bowl
into which they would put a handful
of rice at mealtimes as a contribution
to the fighters. But later, this was not
enough. The tax was doubled. Every
farmer had to give up half his rice crop
to the Viet Cong. And not only rice.
In his last year in the village, every
family had to buy at least one Troops
Support Bond for 200 piastres (about
7/-). When they sold their pigs, ten
percent of the proceeds went to the
Viet Cong; on firewood it *was 50 per-
cent; two piastres were levied for every
chicken sold; and half a piastre for
a bunch of bananas.
In addition to taxes, they contributed
work days. This, too, was not hard at


first, when the quota was one day a
week. But the quota was raised as the
manpower in the village kept declining.
Some were , killed, some were wounded,
while the young people joined the Viet
Cong forces. Many families fled to the
Government side and the burden of
work fell oh the shoulders of the few
who remained. Toward the end, the
work quota for the Viet Cong reached
15 days a month. This work entailed
carrying ammunition and rice from
one place to another; packing tracks
through the jungle; or digging defen-
sive ditches and spiking the bottom
with pungi (sharp bamboo pegs).
Labor was also recruited to tend the
land of villagers who joined the Viet
Cong. The plot of a serving soldier, or
of one who was wounded or killed,
was kept foe him, and the rest of the
farmers had to work it and give the
crop to his family.
The work quota became so heavy
that in order to attend to their own
farms, they often had to work at
night. The rice left to them after
delivering half to the Viet Cong was
not enough to feed the family. The
Viet Cong were aware of the situation.
They could see that the villagers were
unable to bear the weight of taxation
and work quotas, but they had no other
way of maintaining their army.
In his last year, said my refugee
informant, there was also an increase in
the shelling and bombing. His village
was attacked almost every week. Houses
were burned and people were killed and
injured. Sometimes Viet Cong troops
were hit and sometimes civilians. The
people could not stand it any longer.
His was not the only village whose in-
habitants had fled. Most of the
neighboring hamlets had also been
abandoned.
He and his father left with a group
of eleven families. The opportunity
came one day when his village was
surrounded, entered and searched by
a Government force. They were look-
ing for Viet Cong troops. He went
to the officer and said he wished to
move to a Government - controlled
region. The officer sent some of his sol-
diers-, who loaded their belongings on to
trucks and brought them to a refugee
transit camp. He had decided to leave
after learning that the Viet Cong were
recruiting youngsters of 15 and he
feared they would take his son.
He was not sorry he left. He is better
off here. If he had remained in his
village his sons would have joined the
Viet Cong and never returned. He, too,
would have been killed. One bomb had
already fallen in his backyard and his
house was burned. Here, he suffers
no hunger. The Government provides
ricej The two smaller children go to
school, and the older son and daughter
work in the American Army Camp.
They borrowed money and bought
bicycles. The distance to their place
of work is not far, only two hours by
cycle. Even if the war ends he will not
go back to his village. It is better here.
The children bring money as well as
tins of food from the American kitchen.
When he worked for the Viet Cong he
used to receive a daily ration of rice
for two meals and one piastre in cash
for tobacco. Here, his children bring
home every day 100 piastres! He is
thinking, perhaps, of opening a store
at the side of the highway used by the
commuters who work in the city. I
asked him about the farm he had re-
ceived here and why his children
worked in the city and not with him
on the land.
He said he had received nothing. He
was promised a kong acre) as a
kitchen-garden next to his house, and 1
mau acres) near the stream for
growing rice. But he was not given it.
Next to his house he received only half
a kong, and the ricefield had not
materialised. The land which they had
wanted to give him was being claimed
by the family of an Army officer.
Apart from the kitchen-garden he had
nothing, no pigs, no poultry, no bananas,
and no cattle.
In addition to the land (which he did
not get), the Government gave a food
allocation to each family for six months
on the assumption that during this time
they will find work and be able to sup-
port themselves, and also work tools and
materials to build their house. I asked
my guide how much it costs to “settle”
a refugee family, and he said about
£l7/10/-. (In Israel, to set up a family
in farming costs over £500; in Vene-
zuela and Iran over £3000.)
Resettlement
we got up to go my guide said
to me: you see, they are happy
here. And, indeed, I think he is right.
On the stove rice was cooking, rice
flown in from the United States and
given to them free. The children who
returned from school were clean and
they carried their text books with pride
(books in Vietnamese printed in
America). The older children work and
bring home money. And the sound of
artillery fire, which can be heard here
day and night, is that of shells “going”
and not “coming.” There is no doubt
that they are much better off here than
under the rule of the Viet Cong and the
shelling by. Government guns. But what
the Americans call here “resettlement of
refugees on the land” is not really the
building of farm villages but the crea-
tion of slums around their Army
camps.
I spent my last week in Vietnam in
the South, in the Delta and in Lai Khe
with Major-General Depuy, com-
mander of First Infantry Division.
General Depuy had been in Vietnam
three years. His division had fought
everywhere, from the north and south.
He was the veteran among the Ameri-
can generals and the moss experienced
and knowledgeable about She problems
of Vietnam.
He did not conceal his admiration for
the fighting qualities of the Viet Cong
troops. In a directive to his officers,
he has said - that the men who are
fighting each cither at present in Viet-
nam are the finest soldiers in the world,
and that the superiority of the Ameri-
can soldier over his Viet Cong adver-
sary lies in firepower. In this, the
Americans enjoy a huge advantage,
which should be exploited. “When it
comes to artillery,” he says, “consider
yourselves millionaires”—no need to
economise.
Nor does Depuy have any illusions
about the attitude of the Vietnamese
population toward the American Army.
He put it this way: there is currently
in Vietnam a race between two horses
the American war horse, and the
horse of resentment over the American
presence. It is up to the Americans to
ensure that the war horse gains vic-
tory over the Viet Cong before it is
overtaken by the horse of resentment.
The central question remains: what
are the American chances of victory
in the war in Vietnam within a reason-
able period—say, one or two years?
It is the American assumption that
bombing North Vietnam will force the
Hanoi Government to negotiate.
How will things develop if Hanoi,
despite the bombing, refuses to end
the fighting? In this event, it seems
to me, the character of the war will
have to change. If Hanoi decides to
continue the campaign, she will need
to make two basic changes, and the
first is a change in her war aim. The
Viet Cong has no chance of overcom-
ing the American Army and flinging
it into the sea. In fact, the only chance
she has at present of bringing about the
American departure from Vietnam is
within the framework of a peace
treaty —if, of course, the Americans
stick to their declarations on this mat-
ter!
The second is a change in the nature
of the fighting. I do not believe that
Hanoi can continue for very long to
wage a regular war against the Ameri-
can forces. A prolonged Viet Cong
campaign against the United States
Army can be maintained only through
guerilla and terrorist operations, a
method of warfare which denies to
the Americans the military impact of
their superiority in the air, in artillery,
armor, and other technological in-
struments.
Vietnam is, of course, an ideal country
for guerilla warfare. I know no place
where so many roads cross so many
rivers and streams and which are
therefore so easy to sabotage. And not
only are there numerous targets for
guerillas, but the physical conditions
are most favorable for them, with an
abundance of natural places of conceal-
ment the jungle, the thick foliage of
the Delta, and the proximit} of
friendly countries, Laos and Cambodia.
The tropical climate enables them to
stay out in the open in winter and
summer without requiring shelter. There
is plenty of drinking water, plenty of
wood for cooking, and they can draw
fish from any stream without special
effort. If the Viet Cong abandons
regular warfare and goes over to guerilla
operations, I do not think that the
Americans will be able to subdue them.
At all events, the American reply


to guerilla warfarfe cannot be tech-
nological; nor can it be increasing the
number of their troops in Vietnam. I
do not believe that the Americans can
bring pacification to Vietnam. The
Americanisation of the war can, from
the military point of view, succeed; but
the Americanisation of the peace, of
daily life, can only serve the Viet Cong
with terrorist objectives and propa-
gandist arguments against “American
hegemony in Vietnam.”
I am certain that there are better
chances of coping with Viet Cong
guerilla and terrorist operations when,
for example, at the entrance to a village
there are a couple of bedraggled local
guards instead of a tough patrol of
American Marines or paratroopers. The
Viet Cong can, of course, more easily
silence the two local Vietnamese guards;
but that will then be the murder of
two local youngsters, rousing the enmity
of their families and friends, whereas
engaging an American patrol may be
considered a patriotic act by fighters
for Vietnamese independence and the
expulsion of the foreigners.
The more the’Viet Cong terror strikes
at the life of the people of Vietnam,
and not at the American Army, the
easier will it be to fight. If the Viet
Cong mine roads and the victims are
farmers bringing their produce to the
towns, this ’ may not deter the Viet
Cong, but it certainly will not increase
support for them by the local inhabi-
tants.
[JN the long run, the chances of de-
feating the Viet Cong and damming
the spread of Communism depend on
the provision of an alternative, a non-
Communist, answer to the problems.
But the problems need to be answered,
not evaded or ignored. Moreover, the
war itself creates problems. Hundreds
of thousands of families are uprooted,
and they wander in to the coastal zone
and the big towns. Even without State
care, most of the refugees manage some-
how. Thanks to the heavy flow of
money to Vietnam, there are plenty of
jobs, and in a short while the refugees
are absorbed in the building trades, in
workshops, and in service occupations.
The housing problem, too, is “solved”
without great difficulty. In this tropical
climate they can sleep under a ram-
shackle bit of roofing or even in the
street.
There is no lack of land in Vietnam,
no lack of water, and no lack of a
market for agricultural produce, pri-
marily rice. Since there is, anyway,
resettlement of refugees, it can and
should be carried out properly, grant-
ing every settler a suitable allocation
of land—s to 1\ acres for rice grow-
ing—and organising them within the
framework of a co-operative to handle
marketing and credits.
“Farming” 300 square yards and pay-
ing 60 percent interest on credits is
not an alternative answer to Com-
munism; it is a breeding ground for
Communism.
The popularity which the Viet Cong
once enjoyed stemmed not from their
Communist ideology but from their
practical policies: expropriation of the
estates of large landowners and their
distribution to the tenants; replacement
of corrupt officials by honest adminis-
trators; championing the unity of North
and South Vietnam.
The Americans are fighting the Viet
Cong with military implements, with
technological devices. It is possible with
such resources to kill, to destroy, at
times also to subdue. This is of no
mean importance, but it is decidedly
not enough. Bombing and shelling
alone will not seal the Ho Chi Minh
trail for ever.
Why DID the PKI Lose?
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
THE owl of the Minerva spreads
her wings at dusk,” was Hegel’s
pompous way of stating the well-
known fact that in the social sciences
reliable predictions are always of past
events only. The sad demise of the PKI
was welcomed by many and deplored
by some, yet unforeseen by all. Let us,
therefore, follow Hegel and try to
understand the past which we were un-
able to predict.
By the middle of 1965 the PKI
appeared to be on the threshold of
power. The Party apparatus controlled
■ the most important mass-organisations
such as the trade unions and the peas-
ant fronts, and it was in the process of
infiltrating the Army, the last bastion
of anti-Communism, at a rapid pace
and with Sukarno’s blessing and sup-
port. The Communist policy of goading
Sukarno into actions which were bound
to bankrupt the country and then reap-
ing the political benefits from the re-
sulting social disorganisation was an
eminent success; misery was growing,
and with it and through it, the PKI. In
parts of the countryside the Party
appeared to have set itself up as the de
facto grass-root government. The non-
Communist elements of the administra-
tion were either non-existent or were
rotting away in incompetence or cor-
ruption. The very nature of the island
empire seems to have encouraged centri-
fugal tendencies and warlordis,m, con-
ditions notoriously familiar as key
elements of the pre-bolshevik syndrome.
And yet, despite the fact that
“objective conditions” seem to have
favored a PKI victory, total disaster
overcame the PKI in less than a week
following an attempted putsch which
appeared to be quite unnecessary be-
cause it seemed the PKI could have
achieved power without it. What be-
came evident immediately after the dis-
aster was the fact that the PKI was
obviously unprepared to wage guerilla
warfare or, indeed, to command. any
form of armed struggle, and that it
nevertheless undertook such a course of
action in circumstances which did not
seem to have called for it. The situa-
tion was puzzling, since Communist
opposition to what they call “puts-
chism” or “adventurism,” as against
proper revolutionary strategy and tac-
tics, is not just hypocritical double-talk
but a basic corollary of their political
outlook. According to Communist doc-
trine, a strike for State power is war-
ranted only if the target society has
been sufficiently eroded on all levels,
and if the Party apparatus is the only
effective and functioning instrument of
social action.
The Party apparatus must also com-
mand an armed force. An alternative
situation permitting the- final strike
even if the society is not yet fully
eroded is the presence, in the critical
area of the armed forces, of a Com-
munist Sta.te ready to invade the target
society in overwhelming strength. To
entrust the fortunes of Communism to
chance and luck in the style of a
Latin American coup d’etat, without
a proper evaluation of what Trotsky
called “the correlation of social forces”
is deemed to be conduct lacking in his-
torical seriousness and unworthy of
“scientific socialists.” In practice, of
course, the distinction between a mere
“putsch” and a proper revolutionary
insurrection is usually drawn ex-post
PKI leader Aidit-presumed dead


facto by circular reasoning: the success
of a coup proves that the right correla-
tion of forces existed, its failure that it
did not.
On a recent visit to Djakarta I talked
at length to people whose personal and
political fortunes were closely linked
with the events of 1965 and who possess
a deep and sophisticated understanding
of Indonesian politics and society. I
asked them a series of very specific
questions and on analysing what they
had to say I have concluded that some
very tentative generalisations about the
causes of the Communist defeat may
now be suggested. They are the follow-
ing:
(1) Bloated membership. The fact
that PKI membership rose from a few
thousand to several millions in less
than ten years under Aidit’s leadership
has been a source of pride to Com-
munists all over the world. As it
turned out, it became a source of great
weakness. The task of a Leninist com-
bat party is not to accommodate the
masses of the population within its
ranks but to manipulate them through
mass-organisations. Mass-membership
brings with it the blunting of conspira-
torial acuity, attenuation of ideological
orthodoxy, and the danger that seg-
ments of the revolutionary elite may
succumb to the siren voices of nor-
mality emanating from the ordinary
population. The danger is one of the
two classical bolshevik heresies known
as “Right-wing opportunism.” (The
other, obverse, heresy is “Left-wing
Sectarianism.”) As it happened, Aidit
adopted “Right-wing opportunist”
organisational policies, resembling some-
what those of the Italian Communist
Party while issuing “Left-sectarian”
slogans of a Pekingese variety.
»pHE discrepancy between modes of
organisation and slogans, or, as
Marxists would put it, between “base”
and “superstructure,” contributed to the
Party’s undoing. The organisational
policies of “Right-wing opportunism”
were adopted by Aidit in response to
the political requirements of PKI parti-
cipation in the Pantja Sila coalition.
Like Senator Kennedy, whom he other-
wise does not resemble at all, Sukarno is
a great believer in the primacy of
“numbers” in politics. To impress
Sukarno as a serious political force the
leaders of the PKI had to acquire a
mass-membership and become an influ-
ence within the corrupt context , of the
Djakarta establishment. In this way the
PKI traded its “Leninist” character
for a mess of potage mere political
“influence” within the status quo.
(2) The corrupt life-style of PKI
leaders. Contrary to a. common mis-
conception according to which the PKI
stood out as a puritan rock in a mire
of corruption, the PKI leaders adopted
the life-style of other Indonesian not-
ables enmeshed in the Sukarno racket.
They lived in luxury, disported them-
selves with their mistresses and took
graft. There is nothing particularly new
in this. The mode, of life of Com-
munist leaders in Eastern Europe before
and after they had taken full power was
similar. Yet there they had the NKVD
and the Red Army to fall back upon
to protect themselves against the anger
of their proletariat. No such force was
available to the PKI leaders when they
faced their moment of truth.
It is said, by the way, that the
shrewd Sukarno deliberately seduced
them into a sybaritic mode of existence
so as to be able better to use and to
blackmail them. The masses of drifting
unemployed, semi-employed or merely
under-paid clerks and quasi-intellectuals
who constitute the conscious support of
Communist parties in Eastern cities,
and among whom real or “professional”
students play an important role, became
thoroughly alienated from the PKI.
When I spoke to some of the student
leaders, it dawned on me that the
strongest factor in their opposition to
Sukarno and the PKI was not ideo-
logical rejection or economic interest
but moral outrage and contempt at their
insincerity and corruption.
(3) The restricted nature of PKI
control in mass-organisations. It was
generally assumed, before September
1965, that the PKI had control of the
major peasant and working-class mass-
organisations. This was, in a sense, true.
The PKI did control the machinery of
these organisations and it determined
their general policy. Yet the people who
joined these organisations accepted
leadership only for very limited pur-
poses; they were not available for un-
restricted manipulation and certainly
not for manning a Communist-led
armed struggle. The principal reason
for this was that within all mass-
organisations formally controlled by
the Party there existed militant and
highly organised groups of anti-Com-
munist activists, both Moslem and
Catholic, who harried and frustrated the
PKI at every step.
They were led by politically sophis-
ticated, tough, and determined men, in
some ways similar to our own “indus-
trial groups.” It was the existence of
these groups which more than anything
else accounts for the rapid collapse of
the Communist command structure in
Communist - controlled mass - organisa-
tions during the. Gestapu period.
And the opponents could not be
liquidated, since the PKI did not con-
trol the means of violence. By autumn,
1965, the PKI was a frustrated party.
Weighed down by an unstable mass-
membership which it had to fawn and
to flatter and tied to Sukarno’s un-
predictable irrationalities, it had reached
the limits of what mere “influence”
could get. It had to advance into
power or to accept gradual decline, or
perhaps destruction at the hands of the
still-intact Army.
(4) The Indonesian Army. The Com-
munists tried to neutralise the Army in
a number of ways by persuading
Sukarno to direct appointments and
dismissals of officers their way, by
attempting to create a form of “soldiers’
soviets,” by developing the Air Force
as a counterweight to the Army, and
by pressing for the establishment of a
National Militia, controlled by the
Party and armed from Peking. At the
time of Gestapu the Militia project was
merely in the stage of being hatched,
the infiltration and subversion of the
officers’ corps was marginal, and the
Air Force of little use in a situation
where many men with guns are needed,
that is, a land army. The attempt to
subvert the Army by way of soldiers’
soviets proved to be a failure.
PEASANTS formed the overwhelming
majority of the other ranks in the
Indonesian Army. It might be thought
that since the Party appeared to com-
mand the organised loyalties of the peas-
antry, the “peasants in uniform” would
become unavailable for military oper-
ations against the PKI. There are m?,ny
historical precedents for such a situa-
tion. The peasant-soldiers of Petrograd
deserted the provisional government in
October, 1917, and went over to the
Bolsheviks, thereby deciding the fate of
the Russian Revolution. The peasants
in Chiang Kai-shek’s armies refused to
fight the Chinese Red Army and went
over to it or deserted altogether. And
by 1965 the peasants of the South Viet-
namese Army were obviously unwilling,
for one reason or another, to continue
the struggle against the Viet Cong, and
it required massive American military
intervention to turn the tide of the
war.
And yet the Indonesian “peasant in
uniform” fell upon the PKI with the
most frightful ferocity and conducted
the most sanguine massacres in Javanese
villages under PKI control or influence.
Why? Complex effects of regional and
religious loyalties and feuds undoubtedly-
played an important role. Yet there
seems to have been a more general
reason. The Indonesian peasant who
joined up took the road of upward
social mobility, leaving the anonymous
misery of peasant existence behind him.
Well shod and clad for the first time
in his life, with a measure of social
security, and with a newly acquired
higher social status, the peasant turned
soldier feels no “class-solidarity” with
the peasants in general.
They tend rather to represent some-
thing of a threat to him: an ever-
present reminder of the misery from
which he has emerged and into which,
he may still sink back. In so far as there
is any lingering solidarity based on his
former social status it is through his
family with his own village, not with
villages and peasants in general. Like
other peasants, in South-east Asia the
Indonesian peasant lacks political con-
sciousness. His only group solidarity
tends to be with a particular family
or village.
(5) An unfavorable military environ-
ment. Anti-Communists whose 'country
is surrounded by the military might of
a powerful Communist neighbor may
find the odds too great and give in
without much of a fight. Communists

in the same situation will tend to be
more aggressive, optimistic, and enter-
prising. The Czechoslovak coup of 1948
is a good example of such a situation.
In 1965 the environment of Indonesia
was not dominated by China or the
USSR. By far the most powerful mili-
tary factor in Indonesia’s vicinity was
the American Seventh Fleet. America’s
intention not to withdraw from South-
east Asia, which had become quite
manifest in the autumn of 1965, had a
decisive influence on the morale both
of Communists and anti-Communists
in Indonesia. Those who use the debacle
of the PKI rather perversely to support
their claim that the Communists in
South-east Asia can be defeated without
“outside help” and that “the dominoes
may not fall” even if the Americans
withdrew from South-east Asia seem to
forget that outside help may be just
the psychological effect of being around,
and being able to prevent others from
getting too close.
It is not at all clear whether the
USA would have intervened to prevent
an internal Communist takeover in In-
donesia; one can take it for granted,
however, that the USA would not have
tolerated an armed Soviet or Chinese
intervention on behalf of the PKI. Per-
haps neither the Russians nor the
Chinese would have intervened even if
they had dominated the environment
(e.g. the Russians failed to bail out
the Finnish Communists after their
abortive coup in 1948, though Finland
was at Russia’s mercy), yet, in the
event the Indonesian anti-Communists
knew that Communist powers could not
intervene even if they had wanted to.
The sequence of events which con-
stituted the abortive coup is well known
and needs no recapitulation, though
there are many obscurities and loose
ends which make dogmatic insistence
on any specific interpretation of the
actual story inadvisable. The PKI did
not really require an adverse report
from a Chinese doctor about Bung’s
health to realise that Sukarno was a bad

life-insurance risk and that the time of
growth under the mantle of his personal
protection was drawing to a close. Yet
it is puzzling that the PKI should
have taken the road of “adventurist
putschism” in such a reckless manner,
without preparing more adequately for
an armed struggle.
The few armed youth contingents
which it had at its disposal were very
quickly liquidated by the Army. It
seems that in 1965 the situation pre-
sented itself to the PKI leadership in
the following manner: if the Bung were
to leave the political scene, in the very
near future the PKI would have to face
a showdown with the Army anyhow.
While he is still around, a pre-emptive
coup initiated by a disorganising de-
capitation of the Army may just suc-
ceed. If it fails, the consequences are
unlikely to be worse than the con-
sequences of not acting at all and wait-
ing for the Army to make the first
move. Yet there was a third option, a
truly “Leninist” one which the PKI
leaders just did not have the heart to
take: to withdraw from the visible stage,
to dismantle the facade of legal organ-
isations, get the cadres into safety, and
take the hard path of illegal activity
and organisation to fight another day.
T ASKED all my Indonesian contacts
why the PKI failed to take this “one
step backward” so as to be able to
make “two steps forward” in future.
The answers were always the same:
The PKI leaders ceased to think and
act like Leninist cadre men and became
just another bunch of Malay politicians
out for the main chance. Here they
were ensconced in positions of influence
and prestige, their fingers in all the
pies and rackets, with millions of mem-
bers, and feared by many more mil-
lions. Were they to leave all that pomp
and glory behind and take the lean
road of the professional revolutionary
hit by the wrong “correlation of social
forces”? Mistaking appearance for
reality and influence for power, they
struck and they failed. Their failure
was total. The command structure of
the PKI broke down completely and
almost immediately. Different groups
of activists got different and conflicting
directives in different parts of the coun-
try, or no directives at all.
The mass - organisations revealed
themselves completely unviable as in-
struments of insurrection and slipped
out of Communist hands almost at once.
The resentment, tensions, and fears
which the PKI-Sukarno racket had gen-
erated throughout Indonesia boiled over
and found an outlet in massacres en-
couraged, if not always organised, by
the Army. The PKI had attracted many
but it frightened more. Those who felt
threatened took the opportunity of re-
moving the threat with knife and torch.
There is no doubt, however, that if the
PKI had won, the new era would have
been initiated by calculated frightful-
ness and massacres.
The atrocities committed by PKI
activists in certain areas during the very
brief period before they were liqui-
dated, when it looked as if the coup
might succeed, contributed considerably
to the thirst for implacable vengeance.
The political exploitation of the Indo-
nesian massacres by the pro-Communist
Left throughout the world has so far
been very muted, particularly where the
Communists owe allegiance to Moscow
rather than Peking.
The Communist parties insist, of
course, that the PKI was the victim
rather than the aggressor, but they do
it without much conviction, almost
ritualistically, as if merely to satisfy
Lenin’s famous demand that Com-
munist offensive operations, conducted
anywhere, must always be presented as
measures of defence against aggression
from the class enemy. The Soviet Gov-
ernment reacted to the news of the dis-
aster with a sang froid which looked
remarkably like relief. Potentially “pro-
gressive” features of the Suharto re-
gime, which was putting Indonesian
Communists to the sword in large num-
bers, were diagnosed almost at once by
Literaturnaya Gazeta. For the past
three years preceding the coup, the re-
lationships between the Soviet Govern-
ment and the Indonesian Army have
been much more cordial than the re-
lationships between the Soviet Govern-
ment and the PKI, which were very
bad.
Watching the destruction of incon-
venient foreign Communist parties by
the “State power of the class enemy”
with satisfaction is an ancient Soviet
pastime. Occasionally the Soviet Gov-
ernment may even help the process on
a little with provocateurs or otherwise.
It might have done so in Djakarta.
And there can be no doubt that the
weapons which tore into the bodies of
Indonesian Communists were wielded
by Indonesian soldiers but made in the
USSR.
least for the foreseeable future the
PKI seems to be utterly defunct.
Though about 40 percent of the Central
Committee is rumored to have sur-
vived, the organisation of the PKI
is shattered beyond early repair. The
massacres killed many but they bereft
more. Machiavelli’s advice to the prince
not to spare the relatives of his enemies
lest they become future avengers has —
mercifully—not been followed. The
economic decline of the country
continues. Foreign loans and credits
alone cannot halt it unless they are
followed by an army of foreign experts
who would help to alter not only the
material base of Indonesia but her
system of mental habits, which are quite
incompatible with the psychological and
social presuppositions of a successful
economic “take-off.” If the decline is
not halted and reversed, a restored PKI
supported also by thirst for vengeance
may yet return to fight another more
successful battle. Or else the country
may just rot with hitherto unpredictable
evil consequences. Neither prospect can
be contemplated with equanimity by
Indonesia’s neighbors.

Tribute
MANY DESERVED TRIBUTES were
paid last week to the talents and per-
sonality of Zell Rabin, editor of the
Sydney “Daily Mirror,” who died aged
34. The history of the two Sydney
afternoon papers in the past few years
seems to have consisted largely of the
“Sun” doing something badly about six
months after the “Mirror” has begun
to do it well.
We would merely like to put on
record the hope that Rabin will be
remembered for much more than the
noted posters, against which we on
occasion, and not to our surprise, fruit-
lessly fulminated. But there is, after all,
a point at which journalists tend to
stick together.
One such occasion may have been
when Bob Sanders, on Channel 2’s
“People” program, paid his undoubt-
edly sincere tribute to Rabin, but pre-
fixed his remarks by saying he had
on occasion spoken about the “sensa-
tionalism” of some newspapers. Sanders
then went on to his first interview of
the evening with a girl who had
recently had an abortion.
Pay Packet

about conductor Denis Vaughan and
his experiences with the Elizabethan

Rome, is employed by his own com-
pany, headquarters in Lichtenstein, but
registered in the Bahamas.
A Man For His Age
THE VIEW OF AUSTRALIA which
was recorded by the cameras of Cap-
tain Frank Hurley, remained a model
for, or, perhaps, to some people, a
blight on the work of later photog-
raphers, so much so that the spell
has been broken only in the past few
years by people like David Beal and
Robert Goodman.
But the 13 photographic books Hur-
ley produced were, as his daughter,
Toni, points out in her biography,
“Once More On My Adventure,” just
published by Ure Smith, the work of
his relative old age and inactivity. He
began systematically to record his own
country when he was 62 and was
still at it until a short time before
his death at the age of 76 in 1962. In
1961 he was up in the Hamersley
Ranges and exploring caves in the
Nullarbor Plain. These books sold
more than 200,000 copies and, Miss
Hurley writes, “brought a hitherto
unknown affluence to the Hurley
family.”
But times, ideas, and techniques
change. When Miss Hurley thought of
including photographic data in her
book, she showed some of her father’s
technical notes to a young photog-
rapher, whose only remark was that
he “hadn’t a clue what it all meant.”
Before the picture-books was a life-
time during which Hurley showed that
to an extraordinary degree he had the
photographer’s basic equipment the
ability to be there when it is happen-
ing. He spent nearly seven years of
his life in the Antarctic on various
expeditions with Shackleton and Maw-
son. He was in the cockpit of the tiny
plane in which Ross and Keith Smith
flew from London to Sydney, and
covered two world wars as well as
some small ones. He was always a
freelance photographer, except for a
year or so as pictorial editor of the
Sydney “Sun.”
But, Miss Hurley feels now, part of
it was not only that he was always
in the right place at the right time
but that he was born into the right
age, when exploration and flying were
still adventures. It is hard to think
what he would have made of space
exploration with automatic cameras
sending back thousands of exposures
of moon shots and no room for him
in capsules.
Miss Hurley wrote her book, in col-
laboration with the late Frank Legg,
from 24 diaries, which she did not
know existed until after her father
died. The diaries, together with nega-
tives of Hurley’s lifetime’s work, are
now in the National Library in Can-
berra. They were bought, Miss Hurley
said, for a nominal sum $2OOO.
The BBC recently ran some of the
5000 ft. film, “Home of the Blizzard,”
which Hurley made during the 1911
Mawson expedition to the Antarctic.
Frank Legg was working on a docu-
mentary on Hurley’s life and work
for ABC television when he died. Miss
Hurley has had no firm advice of
when this will be finished and shown.
The New Stone Age
WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT last
week of the 372 ft., 19-million AMP
building, Melbourne at last has its
answer to Sydney’s Australia Square.
The new building will be faced with
polished granite. In fact, many of Mel-
bourne’s newest buildings have moved
away from the glasswall front, almost
uniform to new buildings in Australian
cities a decade ago, to more extensive
use of stone.
New buildings, such as the National
Mutual, the Colonial Mutual, the CRA,
the Reserve Bank, and the Bank of
N.S.W., opposite the Town Hall,
feature stone as well as glass on their
frontages, making the pioneering
glasshouse of the ’fifties the ICI
building look slightly old-fashioned.
Perhaps the revival of stone has
something to do with Melbourne’s
climate or its stronger faith in the
permanence of things, but stone has
been making such a strong comeback
that the industry has been caught with
a staff shortage. The Master Stone
Masons’ Association of Victoria has
made a public appeal to young men
to enter the industry.
The swing is not to the solid granite
look of the late 19th century. Stone is
now used as a veneer or decoration

rather than a stuctural part of the
building. Steel has replaced it there.
And the change seems to have come
about because architects have now dis-
covered what the stone men have been
saying all along, that glass is eventu-
ally dull and monotonous and stone can
provide more color and character.
A lot of the reversal has come about
because of some new processes the
stone masonry industry has developed.
Most significant is the wire saw, which
ably cuts stone into thin slabs which
are ideal for veneer work. Australia has
plenty of varieties of stone available in
reasonable quantities and a range of
colors. It can be made more interesting
by polishing, semi-polishing, rough
surfacing, or, as in the case of one new
Government building in Canberra, by
being given a burnt surface. This was
done simply with blowtorches.
We also note with interest that stone
is returning to our cemeteries. It is
easier and cheaper to maintain than
lawn plots with plain markers. What is
more, people seem to want something
more significant than a stretch of grass
much the same as everyone else’s. There
are now available special family stone
memorials which can hold up to 24
members of a family, if about half are
conveniently cremated to take up less
space. This type of thing works out
more cheaply than 24 separate lawn
plots.
Through a Glass Brightly
THE NUMBER of new churches
springing up in suburbia and. in the
•country towns may be indicative of a
religious revival in the ’sixties, but to
Miss Paddy Robinson, late of County
Armagh, Northern Ireland, it means
that Australia needs stained-glass win-
dows, a commodity not often called for
in the green land of her birth.
“Apart from a large window now
being dedicated in Rostrevor, County
Down, and a small window in the
belfry of Kilbronnie Parish Church,
where I used to ring the bell I have
left no windows behind me in Ireland,”
she told us in a voice rich with the
North Irish brogue. “Sixty or seventy
years ago there were stained-glass win-
dows going in all over the place in
Ireland. But there’s no call for them
now.”
A tall well-built girl of 22, Miss Rob-
inson has a long ponytail of red hair
and the pale Irish complexion, but
there is nothing anaemic about the
trade she is following. Employed by
Hungarian artist Stephen Moor, who
has pioneered this work in Australia
and whose design for the Jesuit Church
at Lavender Bay, N.S.W., is quite out-
standing in modern stained glass, Miss
Robinson carries out his designs, cuts
the inch-thick glass, mixes and pours
the concrete.
She has been in Australia for only a
year and was not in time to work on the
Lavender Bay project, but has just com-
pleted a three-panel window for a
church at Warialda, N.S.W. She finds
the modern work exciting and meaning-
ful and more demanding than the
purely representational stained glass.
“Though the work of the 13th- and
14th-century artists is more modern
than anything we can do today,” she
said.
Prosaically she was led to her interest
in working with stained glass through
her family. ‘My aunt was a stained-
glass artist. I suppose it was in my
sphere of thinking. When I saw an
exhibition of German church art I
became conscious of the modern aspect,
and from then on it dominated my
interest in art.”
Skill is the word for working with
stained glass. The process is long, in-
volved, and expensive. Fortunately, the
window is always commissioned, so that
the artist takes no risk in producing it.
The first step is the design. This is
drawn to scale of one inch to the foot.
When this is approved, a full-size
cartpon or working drawing is made.
Working from this the artist paints on
the glass. Each piece is cut, then fired.
Cutting the heavy glass is a delicate
part of the operation. The design must
be basically simple. Every motif is
stripped down to the barest indication.
Only certain colors can be achieved,
and the stained-glass artist works from
a palette of tiny pieces of glass leaded
together, to remind him of the range
available. The work is always done
against the light. Before leading or con-
creting, wax is used to hold the win-
dows together to show the effect,
At the present time in the Ars Sacra
stained-glass studio at Strathfield, Miss
Robinson has one of her own windows
waxed to the glass “easel.” This is just
pure design unconcerned with red-eyed
serpents, doves, and religious figures.
It will eventually find a home in her
flat. “But what I need is a whole
church,” she says hungrily. “That is.
what every stained-glass artist hopes

The Letters of Trevor Gooseboot
(Intercepted by Will Rush ton)
Dear Mother,
I hate to think what murderous thoughts are lurking in your mind as Mr.
Wilson prepares to link Britain with Europe. How ironical to think that it
was your Mr. Heath who had the last stab at it! I remember at the time
his saying “I cannot see how they can ‘No’,” forgetting that they could very
easily say ‘Non’! and did. Anyway, do try to control yourself and let us
hear no more unpleasantness about Wops, Frogs, Dagoes, and Krauts. We
are all brothers under the skin. It does make one proud again, though, par-
ticularly after the LBJ Incident, to hear Australians rummaging once more
through their links with the Old Dart, hauling aged maps of the world,
when half of it was colored Red, out of the attics.
Arthur has gone berserk. He set about Holt for not having performed with
distinction at the Front in World War 11, and not filling Vietnam with hia
step-sons. “Chicken!” he cried. In England, I know one of the major objec-
tions to the Youth of Today, is that they haven’t enjoyed the benefits of a
good World War. Australia has got Vietnam, at least, to keep the lads ofl
the streets, but unless we invade Rhodesia, it can only lead to an extremely
decadent Generation. It’s not Arthur’s point, I admit, but that he should
start objecting is a bit much. So much for Longfellow now. Bring back the
Blitz! Send all l the Holts to Vietnam! Actually, that’s not a bad idea on
reflection. Mrs. Jones could go, too.
Yours ever,
Trevor.


The Broom-cupboard Bustler
By CHARLES HIGHAM
IF it is possible to bustle in a broom-
closet, then Gareth Powell —in his
tiny suite at the Australia Hotel in
Sydney—bustled. He’s 34, and has
worked as circus groom, Unilever clerk,
pea-canner, scrap hand, barman, second-
hand-car salesman, and his present job
is as managing director of the New
English Library and its subsidiary, Four
Square Books. He’s engagingly brisk,
bright and bouncing, and wore blue.
“I’m here to publish, in exactly two
weeks, a book not yet finished by Will
Rushton entitled ‘The “I Didn’t Know
the Way to King’s Cross When I First
Came Here But Look At Me Now”
Book,’ and I’m going to publish ten
books a year here, and the Rushton
book will appear in two weeks, even
though, as I said, I haven’t even got
the manuscript yet,” Mr. Powell said
without drawing breath. “I must tell
you about another book I have coming,
oh, baby, it’s going to be a book! To
go back a littl'e I must tell you about a
man at the turn of the century- —he
published a bibliography of every
pornographic book in the world.” Mr.
Powell mentioned something that
sounded like the Index Expurgatorius.
“No, everybody ' 'gets that wrong. Not
the Catholic one. ; And my favorite title
ih that list is ‘The Account of a Lady
Who Was Accosted, Assaulted,
Ravished, ahd Raped on the Royal
Scottish Express,’ and in that list again
was the title,“ f-Walter, the English
Casanova.’ Well, 'i I heard about this
book from the \jndergr from the
people who know about such things.
The man Walter > had exactly 3200
women in his lifetime —and he was such
a snob! He’d write,: ‘She was quite clean
for a member of the working classes,’
while removing, her knickers. Baby,
what a book!.
- “There were, .three copies I knew of
waffling round somewhere—one in the
Kinsey Institute, another in the British
Museum, and the third in the library
of a famous English collector of por-
nography.” Graham Greene? “I invoke
the first and third amendments of the
American Constitution ... I will not
answer that question . . .
“I got a photocopy of one of the
three copies—l’m not saying which, and
I daren’t say how much the copying
cost me —as much as I pay one of my
first novelists —I cut it from 11 volumes
—more than a million words—to one
volume . . . exhausting? Oh, no! I
have the greatest capacity for work—
I work sometimes from six in the morn-
ing to one the next morning on a
sandwich /”
What had been his first success, and
how had he got into publishing? “I
worked for the ‘Metal Bulletin’ —as a
clerk first, then I redesigned the whole
magazine—l learned all about printing
—there was nothing left I didn’t know.
Then I went to Smith’s, the big book
people, and finally I set up my own
publishing firm with friends—the May-
flower Press. Capital? None. So friends
wrote books for me for free. I wrote
a novel myself, in four and a half days.
The title? Sorry. I have tried to buy
up every single copy in existence. We
got a list, and then we did ‘Fanny
Hill.’
“ ‘Fanny Hill’ . . . No, the British
Museum wouldn’t let me see it so I
got it out of a private pornographic
library. I published it and the police
searched the premises. They were
going to pick up any book that had
a female on the cover. So they picked
up ‘The 5.45 from Paddington,’ by
Agatha Christie. It had Margaret
Rutherford on the cover.
“J WAS tried under section three of
the Obscene Publications Act, so
that I didn’t have a jury. Only a magis-
trate. And if you’re tried by a magis-
trate, you don’t win. It took him
exactly two minutes 32 seconds to find
me guilty. But if I lost the battle, I
won the war. I cut bits out, sold half
a million copies of ‘Fanny.’ At five
shillings.
“My next very big success was ‘The
Carpetbaggers.’ How did I get it? By
paying Harold Robbins £35,000 for it.
And I sold it at 7/6, the highest Eng-
lish price up to that time for a paper-
back. Everyone was bidding. But I
bid the highest. Money? No problem.
If you have a record for hitting them
every time you can easily get £35,000.
It’s like an impresario who has had
hits on his hands —does he have prob-
lems?”
Hadn’t it been a battle, getting his
books on to the stands, in front of the
public, against the big boys in the
trade? “Competition? I hear say
it’s fiction, I insist, for quotation
that one publisher sent men around
putting grapes — black grapes —in his
rival’s books—and they squashed, and
ruined the books oh, fiction, of
Gareth Powell
course! And another went around kick-
ing the legs off the stands, so the books
fell out! But me, I have many friends,
baby, in the business. Wholesale.
Retail. I got my books in how?
well, the knives were out, and stabbing*
But I’m tough. My men are tough.
And I was so little, I didn’t come out
with a big list right away I
squeezed in.
“I signed John O’Hara. In Britain.
For four books, no one had ever
signed him for so many before. How
did I get him? I flew across to him
and I said, ‘lnterested in 10,000 dol-
lars, luv?’ He was! I sold the hard-
cover rights to Hodder and Stoughton.
And that’s another story. I buy all
rights to a book, sell them to hard-
back, hand the author the money
from the hardback sales, all of it. No,,
it’s good business, really, because, well,
the authors, they love it, and I get
them, don’t I, oh, baby! Don’t I! But
the publishers blackballed me for that.
They said, ‘lt isn’t done! Oh, I
tell you, the way they talk, I’m not
educated, I’ve a great big bloody chip
on my shoulder, I tell you and the-
head of the publishers’ society was also-
the head of Hodder.
“Like I said, I sold the O’Hara rights:
to Hodder they were pleased
and the head of Hodder stood up for
me over the business of buying all
rights. Naturally. So they threw him_
out as head of the publishers.
“The hierarchy? Penguin brought
out 26 million units this year and Pan.
20 million. I brought out 17. That
makes me —yes —third biggest in
Britain. I’ve published Harold Robbins,
and the Pope John XXIII book. AncL
I’m doing a little item called ‘Candy.’
I’ve bought the Olympia Press —no it’s-
not true Maurice went broke, but they
needed the distribution, and we have
it, and Maurice is working for me,
scouting for authors—the ones heV
finding! Oh, you have no idea! Maurice
Gorodias is a good editor! Wait a
minute. Here, just a sec. I want to
take your photograph, I’m doing a
horror book and you’ll do just fine for
one of the illustrations or maybe the
cover, click —that’s it. I get my kicks-
this way. My firm—ah, now, my edi-
tors are young —yes, they, too, some-
times work from six till one a.m. like I
do. They’re in their early twenties, f
pay them very highly, they’re all hungry
for my job, one I hired was teaching-
Tibetan refugees English in Scandi-
navia when I discovered him, I send
them all out for two weeks every year
to sell books on the road.
“And they have to explain at meet-
ings why they took such and such a
book and didn’t take another one. . I
remember one of my editors said he
wouldn’t take an Enid Blyton book
because it was obscene. It began ‘Noddy
was walking along a road and he felt
a little queer . . . ’ Australia? Well
I’ve met editors, young editors, at Lans-
downe I thought brilliant. Paul Hamlyn,
he’s upstairs right this minute, said he’d


like to take four editors straight back
to London with him, right now, and
pay them better. I just saw Stanley
Horwitz’s yacht. It’s the biggest yacht
I ever saw in my life. It makes the
Queen Mary look like a paper boat.
You don’t get money like that being
behind the markets. And the future
here is wide open. I was through
Singapore. You can sell a sackful there
the Philippines! Oh, baby!
27 percent of the population in Singa-
pore is still at school. Educational
books! And we can have shops within
shops here, shops within shops selling
our books. I’m looking into that. You
take space, have plastic racks. And in
two weeks, two weeks we’ll be publish-
ing ‘The “I Didn’t Know My Way
to King’s Cross When I First Came
Here and Look At Me Now” Book.’
And it isn’t even finished yet . . .”
Selling Books like Cereals
By J. C. KAYE
COMPANIES directed by Mr. Paul
Hamlyn publish 750 titles a year
and sell 40 million copies—all
non-fiction. At 40, he has a reasonable
claim to being one of the big publishers
of the world, as well as the greatest in
Britain. Not all his output is high
standard, although it is indubitably
impressive. “We publish more third-
rate rubbish than anyone,” he says with
a note of almost perverse pride.
Quality is to come now that quantity
has been mastered. “We’re the biggest,
our next ambition is to be the best,”
is how he puts it.
Mr. Hamlyn, slender, brisk, beauti-
fully tailored in the thin-legged, Hardy-
Amies style, is a director of the Inter-
national Publishing Corporation, Mr.
Cecil King’s Holborn giant that num-
bers the “Daily Mirror” and “Sunday
Pictorial” among its newspapers, and
Lord knows how many assorted maga-
zines and other publications in its
empire.
Hamlyn has been a King man since
1964, when IPC paid him more than
£2 million to take over his book-pub-
lishing and vending interests. All the
book publishing of IPC went into the
Hamlyn concern as part of the deal.
Mr. Hamlyn now has an office—room
912—in the Holborn edifice, across the
passage from Cecil King, whom he
describes as a very nice fellow, although
desperately shy.
The publication “New Bookman,” a
year or two ago, reported on Mr.
Hamlyn’s eyrie and said that a “rich,
deep silence” filled the air, so much so
that Hamlyn found it necessary to play
tapes of traffic noises to himself to
re-create reality.
When I saw Mr. Hamlyn at the
Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne,
on his visit to the southland, he was
happy to report that, although the
silence was still rich and deep, he had
got used to it and no longer needed
the tapes. His secretary, however,
after threatening to leave a dozen times
because of sheer loneliness, had at last
resigned and gone her way.
The King-Hamlyn interests in Aus-
tralia include half of Cheshire’s, as
well as the Lansdowne and Jacaranda
Presses. He has plans for expansion
here, where, in his view, publishing is
still, like much of English publishing,
on the conservative and over-cautious
side. The secret of his success is that he
has introduced “merchandising” into
the publishing world.
The general idea, as with King news-
papers, is that financial success is the
principal aim, so that no reluctance is
felt to selling books like cereals, socks,
or any other commodity.
This frank attitude, he is the first
to admit, has brought him under
trenchant attacks from minds of the
older school. He is not repentant.
Paul Hamlyn, the son of a pediar
trician, was born in Germany in 1926,
but moved to England when he was
about seven. He was educated at a
Hertfordshire school combining the
virtues of “Quakerism, vegetarianism,
and co-education.”
He is not a Quaker, and not a
vegetarian. He was married once,
but it has broken up. When I com-
miserated with him on the break-down
of this marriage he said with a cheer-
ful briskness, “Not at all!”
As a very young man he drifted in
and out of jobs, and at one time was
an office boy and editor of the corres-
pondence column on “Country Life.”
He wrote himself a lot of letters and
amused himself hugely thereby.
J)RAFTED into the coalmines as a
“Bevan Boy” he had a “hideous”
time, but had the presence of mind to
mail to his friends chips from the first
big lump of coal he ever handled.
Today his company owns “Country
Life,” besides much else, and his
interests are cars, boats, music, travel,
and French-style cooking, with coal-
mining coming nowhere.
In 1949, with only £3OO left to him
by his grandfather, he took a shop in
Camden Town, London, and began the
sale of “remaindered” books from
various publishing houses.
He sold cheaply, quickly, and with
unflagging drive, aided in time by
several score of vigorous salesmen.
With his quick mind and an enor-
mous nervous energy bequeathed to
him by his mixed German, French,
Russian, and Spanish forebears, he saw
a wide-open gap in the book world
that none of the existing publishers,
apparently, had the imagination or
drive to close.
Less than 15 years after his start, his
cheap resale and reprint business was
Paul Hamlyn
a rip-roaring success. At one time, in
editorial offices in Fulham Rd., he
had more than 60 people whose job it
was to edit, write, design, translate, and
research the books Hamlyn planned to
produce.
Today he has 1400 employees, but
the general idea is the same.
There is an idea for a book-
“Antiquities of the Andes,” let’s say, to
coin a name. An expert is found to
prepare the text for a fee. People are
set into action on the pictures and
design.
In almost no time there is a fine new
book on antiques in the Andes, and,
with no further royalties to pay, it goes
on the market and may sell 15,000
copies.
Some books take great time and
money all the same. “World Architec-
ture” took five years to get out, and
cost £15,000 in editorial costs and
fees.
At the time of the King takeover in
1964, Paul Hamlyn had increased the
turnover of his business from £50,000
to £2 million a year within eight years.
The King offer attracted him as an
opportunity for a “change of pace”
and a new wider field of activity. The
£2 million King paid him has not
changed his life much. He has done
nothing with the money, he told me.
It’s just there.
Politically he’s “Left,” with an
admiration for Harold Wilson.
His own taste in reading runs to
Balzac and Dostoevsky. His attitude to
life, however, belies these rather grim
chaps. He’s quick, a touch sardonic, and
very, very much on the ball.
“I’m a wheeler-dealer,” he says.


AROUND MELBOURNE
Getting into Troubled Waters
IT is not generally realised that we
Victorians, a very quiet, peace-
loving people, are practically at
war with South Australia. Undoubt-
edly it is the Census that has caused
the trouble. It proved that Adelaide,
with a population of 726,930, at last
had passed Brisbane and was now
Australia’s third city. So Mr. Walsh
can hardly wait to invade our
Sudetenland.
Actually our border disputes with
these aggressive people have been
going on for a long time. Let me
give you a dossier on their activities.
South Australia separated from New
South Wales in 1834 and their boun-
daries were fixed at the 141st and
132nd meridians. In 1839 sur-
veyors, after a massive expedition
which took six months, defined the
boundary. Apparently they didn’t
feel this was good enough, so in
1847 Henry Wade, appointed by the
N.S.W. Government, did the job
again, and his boundary was ex-
tended by E. R. White, appointed
by the brand-new Government at
.Port Phillip in 1850.
In the 1860 s South Australians
became suspicious that the instru-
ments used by White and Wade
were old-fashioned, and they called
in the Government astronomers from
the respective colonies. They found
that Wade had fixed the 141st
meridian in the wrong spot. The
border actually should have been
two miles and 19 chains to the
west.
From then on, the Adelaide
gentlemen became very difficult.
They wrote repeatedly to the Vic-
torian Government. They called for
further surveys and there actually
was one in 1873. In 1889 the
S.A. Parliament approved a new
boundary. We were pretty decent
about it. The bill went before Vic-
torian Parliament and it was only
Rejected by three votes.
the disputed two
miles and 19 chains had become
a hot no-man’s land, 340,000 acres of
it. When the Victorians began sell-
ing and leasing chunks of this terri-
tory, Adelaide was livid. We only
really sold 22,677 acres.
In 1911 they took us to the High
Court. Not only did they claim the
land, but all the profits and moneys
received right back to 1850. The
High Court sat for 22 days and very
sensibly found in favor of Victoria.
Still the South Australians didn’t
give up. In 1914 they took the dis-
pute to the Privy Council. The
PC found for Victoria again, point-
ing out that the border was for-
mally proclaimed by the Governor
of South Australia in 1847 and
therefore its position was perfectly
correct in law. If borders had to
be changed every time new instru-
ments were invented, then no line
would be safe. One judge dissented.
The British Act of Parliament had
fixed the border at the 141st meri-
dian, so the 141st meridan it should
be, and even the King himself
couldn’t alter that fact.
The “Argus” was magnificent on
this occasion. It pointed out how
both the High Court and the Privy
Council had utterly brushed aside
the South Australian claims. It
pointed out their meanness, their
greed, how this State, which had
so much territory, picked on our
small State, which had so little. It
had all cost an immense amount of
money, yet we were the same race,
subject to the same Crown; and the
“Argus,” working to a noble climax,
said: “The claim of S.A. never had
a particle of moral or equitable
force behind it. From first to last
it was a political agitation conducted
in the narrowest possible spirit.”
South Australia, of course, never
forgot this, and for the past nine
months it has been on again. This
time over the offshore boundary.
The South Australian Premier says
the boundary should be a continua-
tion of the border (that line set by
Henry Wade. At least they don’t
want it two miles the other way.)
Our Sir Henry Bolte says that the
line should be drawn at right-
angles to the general trend of the
coast. This makes the division veer
to the west and it all adds up to a
sizable chunk of territory which
could mean millions of dollars in
oil and natural gas. Actually it adds
up to 54 square miles, and some of
it very deep water, but, as Sir Henry
“But, sir, which is their air
space . .. ?”
points out, in 10 to 20 years the
search could be conducted in water
6000 feet deep.
We have called in our authorities.
Dr. J. R. V. Prescott, Senior Lec-
turer in Geography at Melbourne
University and author of “Geog-
raphy of Frontiers and Boundaries,”
said that drawing the line at 90
degrees, as suggested by Victoria,
was the fair boundary.
Sir Henry announced that South
Australia’s Mr. Walsh was putting
too much emphasis on fiddling
around with Guy Fawkes’ Day in-
stead of attending to things that
really mattered. Mr. Walsh, with
dignity, replied: “It certainly does
not behove a knight of the realm
to indulge in personalities—particu-
larly outside his own State. Sir
Henry would have people believe
he is the only authoritative person
in this matter.”
S IR HENRY offered a compro-
mise. Why not split the differ-
ence and put the boundary halfway
between the two? Mr. Walsh re-
plied: “I will not concede an inch.”
Sir Henry said: “Further negotia-
tions now appear to be useless. I
have withdrawn my offer and will
stand firm on the original propo-
sition.”
Mr. Walsh said: “Sir Henry is
always screaming his head off over
something or other.”
So you see, the situation between
the two States is at flashpoint, and
to make matters worse we have the
old no-man’s land problem. South
Australia * already has granted
licences according to their idea of
the boundary. Will Sir Henry do
the same and will there be war?
Mr. Walsh’s cry “I will not con-
cede an inch” has the ring of the
great cries of history like “They shall
not pass!” Sir Henry has suggested
that the matter may have to go to
the International Court, but like
the Africans, the South Australians
may be suspicious of this. Mean-
while, we are ready.
We still have a unit of Her
Majesty’s Victorian Navy, HMVS
Cerebus, now being used as a break-
water at Blackrock. We have 5000
marching girls in uniform. We have
an immense fleet of Cessnas with
the Royal Victorian Aero Club, and
one more word from Mr. Walsh
and we shall start a blockade. We
can starve them of supplies of Corio,
of Holden engines, of Falcons, of
Graham Kennedy, and even more
viciously we may not invite any
more of their horses over for the
Melbourne Cup. Watch it, Mr.
Walsh.

Education and Hal Porter
By JOHN McLAREN
IT is always dangerous to take on a
creative writer, and when the target
is as talented a master of insight
and eloquence as Mr. Porter the task is
perilous in the extreme. However, I
cannot allow to pass the remarks he
makes about education in those parts
of his latest essay in autobiography
which were recently published in THE
BULLETIN. It may be a part of Mr.
Porter’s charm that he wears his
opinions so lavishly, but his attempt to
turn back the educational clock must
be sternly resisted.
You will recall that Mr. Porter de-
scribed his colleagues on the staff of
the Williamstown State School as mar-
tinets whose sole aim was to instil a
respect for the virtues of law and order
into the anarchic ruffians whose lives
it was their destiny to control. This
was certainly the main prop of antipo-
dean educational philosophy in those
balmy pre-war days, although the logi-
cal foundation of the system had been
effectively destroyed by Roger Ascham
as far back as the days of the first
Elizabeth. This fact would not, how-
ever, disconcert Mr. Porter, for Eng-
lish life in those days was also marked
by a distaste for bathing and an in-
clination toward long hair, the results
which he sees flowing from permissive
education today.
fpHE chief danger of punitive discip-
line is that the code it enforces is
based on fear and does not operate once
the sanctions are withdrawn. It incul-
cates a harsh personal code within a
moral vacuum, with the result that we
have such paradoxes as the anarchic
duelling of the German students and
the immaculately conducted gas-camps
for the non-Aryans, and the animal con-
duct exhibited toward their prisoners
by the exquisitely mannered disciples
of Bushido.
This is not to say, of course, that all
the products of the martial school fit
the same mould. Mr. Porter himself
points out that one of the virtues he
learnt from his colleagues was kindness,
and it is a commonplace that the
toughest exterior often covers a
genuinely kind heart. The teacher
whose personality is right can probably
get away with the most diabolical
methods because his pupils will forgive
him. But the man who enthusiastically
embraces the rod is unlikely to teach
the grace of forgiveness. A teacher’s
authority gives him absolutely totali-
tarian powers, even in the democratic
’6os, and he does not need the
birch or the leather to exercise his
rule. The coldly aloof stance, the sar-
castic tongue, the ready wit to humili-
ate the weak, these are sufficient to
make him rightly abhorred in the
presence and memory of all his stu-
dents. Yet such men, in some cases,
exercise the highest authority in Aus-
tralian schools today.
These are not, of course, the teachers
of whom Mr. Porter writes. Yet they
are the products of the same system,
just as the British ruling class, with its
virtues as well as its vices, was the in-
evitable product of Eton and engineer-
ing. And just as there is no one whom
the colonial tyrant detests as much as
the native who stands up for himself,
so there is no one even the most en-
lightened teacher detests so much as
the parent who interferes with school-
room discipline. As the irate parent
strides across the quadrangle, the staff*
room closes its ranks and the burly
young footballer is sent to answer the
door with a lump of four-by-two in his
hand. It is strange that this professional
virus is strong enough to produce its
defensive reaction in Mr. Porter so long
after his physical presence has become
a stranger to the classroom.
Yet it could not be said that he
numbers scholarly regard for evidence
among his professional virtues, for the
examples he chooses to cite are pre-
cisely those who are denied the advan-
tages of the modern education he
detests. Certainly, the London lay-
abouts he describes have been to
“Modem Schools,” but this name is
only another example of the genius
of the English tongue for extending the
meaning of a word until it embraces its
opposite. The Modern Schools set up
under the 1944 act were crammed into
the oldest buildings with the least quali-
fied and most incompetent staff as
places for lower-class students to drag
out their days until they accomplished
the increased span of fifteen years and
were released on to the labor market
to earn excessive sums in dead-end
jobs. The long-hair cult originated
among the Liverpool “beatles” as a
gesture of protest against the fortunate
denizens of grammar schools where
such enlightened methods as might be
found in England were to be discovered.
Their first imitators were, of course,


from among the public-school society
set who had been brought up in the
similarly slave-camp conditions of the
greater public schools.
Mr. Porter seems to regard respect
for self-expression as the greatest fault
of contemporary education. Once again,
his evidence is drawn not. so much from
the school room as from its alleged
products in this case, presumably,
the devotees of modern art who respect
a blob of eccentrically shaped paint as
the greatest piece of inspiration since
the Van Gogh Mr. Porter’s contempor-
aries surreptitiously admired. Cer-
tainly, some such people will be heard
supporting their fads by reference to
the work of the prodigies of the infant
department, but their perversions can
no more be held to damn an educational
technique than can the misreading of
the philistines be considered to dis-
credit a work of literature.
No one would argue that the infant
smearing paint across a piece of canvas
is learning to emulate a Rembrandt,
although the experience may eventually
give him the understanding of a
medium of expression which is funda-
mental to the practice of art. His
activity is based on two premises. The
first is that he has a need to express
the world as he sees it. The grotesque
eye on a stick may not represent daddy
to the proud parent, but it may well
represent those features which appear
most significant in daddy to his son.
-Other distortion is, of course, inevitably
present as a result of the child’s lack
of manipulative skill, but when we
praise him we are not expressing a
critical judgment so much as an ack-
nowledgement of effort and integrity.
I'J'HE second premise is that a child’s
understanding of concrete processes
develops before his ability to handle
abstract concepts. The implications of
this are just starting to permeate our
primary schools, where they can be seen
in the use of cuisenaire rods for num-
bers as well as in the use of free paint-
ing in art. Eventually, some education-
ists believe, the entire primary cur-
riculum should be modelled around the
concepts which will later be taught
more formally in the secondary school.
It is significant that this scheme has
been developed not by airy-fairy theo-
reticians but by hard-headed scientists
concerned with America’s place in the
space race.
It is probable that the proudest
products of Mr. Porter’s schools are
those who, like himself, have rebelled
against their conventions. Similarly,
the most valuable products of today’s
schools will be those who throw off con-
ventions which we are not even aware
of. But, in the meantime, there is no
doubt that the contemporary school is
a place of greater humanity which will
be more likely to produce compassion
apd tolerance, if not creative zeal,
among its students than were any of
its predecessors. For the ordinary
student, this is as much as we can ex-
pect, and, for the genius, school is
unnecessary anyway.
Birthday at the Barracks
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE 125,th
birthday of
Victoria Bar-
racks, Sydney,
went, so far as
one could see.
without a hitch.
Except, that is,
for an agonising
moment when the
flag stuck for a
second during the
Ceremony of
Beating the Re-
treat.
However, first
things first. We
drove through the
gate and were
greeted instantly
with a splendid
present-arms from a sentry dressed in
authentic 1848 Eleventh (North Devon-
shire) Regiment of Foot uniform,
plumes, mutton-chops, and all. Were
those mutton chops real? we wanted to
know. No. They had been applied by
the make-up department of the
ABC. One soldier had complained
about his issue of mutton-chops
(grey), but in the Army such
vanities are not tolerated. They
matched what nature had already
bestowed, and he would like grey
mutton-chops or lump them.
“Better weather today,” we cried, as
we swept past the familiar face of
Regimental ■ Sergeant-Major Wildman,
but he didn’t hear. Mr. Wildman
looked less relaxed than last week when
we called during our wet Day in Pad-
dington, but that Army show had been
cancelled. This one was definitely on.
A sudden influx of admirals’ cars
diverted his attention, parking to the
left instead of to the right, and Mr.
Wildman hove to with unsuspected
speed to sort them out.
Anyway, thence to the holy of
holies, the Barracks cricket pitch, and
our allotted seats in the stand. Every-
where we turned, soldiers on Best
Behaviour saluted and clicked to atten-
tion on the least provocation, and
evoked memories of those days in the
Wrens when a fixed smile hid so
many vicious thoughts. A female guest
said she would love to give the Chief
of 1 Staff a kiss. “And so you shall,”
said the Brigadier, removing his cap
and offering a cheek it being
Queen’s Regulations to indulge in such
intimacy with uniform cap off.
The N.S.W. Governor, Sir Roden
Cutler, was not due for another ten
minutes or so, and there was time to
stare and see who was who and what
they wore. Cardinal Gilroy, I suppose,
in dark suit and purple stock, stood
out among the civilian men, and no
doubt at all but that Mrs. Amber
Oxley, nee Bushell, in blue ostrich
feather hat and blue coat, among the
women. But fashion cannot compete
with uniform, and with all that Army
green, Naval white, and a bit of Police
blue, sartorial efforts were eclipsed.
And when the Eastern Command and
Royal Military College bands appeared,
resplendent in red, white, and blue
uniforms, even the beauty of Mrs.
Oxley’s hat was dimmed.
“SPECTATORS ARE RE-
QUESTED TO STAND ON THE
ARRIVAL OF HIS EXCELLENCY
THE GOVERNOR . . .” said the
program, and so, on the dot of five
o’clock, we stood. They worried last
week about the effect of soldiers’ boots
on the grass, what did they think when
two out-riders on motor-bikes zoomed
across it, followed by Sir Roden’s mag-
nificent grey Rolls-Royce? Out he
climbed with Lady Cutler and received
the royal salute (first six bars of “God
Save the Queen”). Then Major-
General Harrison, who is in charge
of Eastern Command, got up and said
his bit, which included a long message
from Marina, Duchess of Kent, wishing
everyone well on this auspicious occa-
sion, and a reference to one Lieutenant
Colonel Barney who built the Barracks
in 1841, and whose sword and epau-
lettes would be worn a little later dur-
ing the Ceremony by an officer. Plus,
of course, the rest of his uniform.
Lieutenant Colonel Barney’s great-
granddaughter was present, said the
Major General, and in the pause that
followed we thought perhaps there
might be a roll of drums in her honor,
or that the lady in question might
rise so we could see her. But no. Where-
ever she sat, she stayed put.
We all settled back, then, for the
Beating Retreat Ceremony, and what
a superb spectacle it was. Sam Spiegel
could not have done better. The
Army did us, and the television cam-
eras behind us, proud. The Cutler boys
were filming at the back, with chew-
ing gum to aid their concentration*
and when their father’s car returned
(preceded once more by out-riders) to
take him to the Officers’ Mess for
cocktails, they ran down for a lift.
It was refused.
The next part of the celebration ran
fairly to form. Another band played
softer music on the Officers’ Mess
lawn, and a long queue shuffled in for
refreshment. It was at this point that
we lost the four-year-old boy in our
charge. It was also at this point that
we lost the best story of the day. It
later transpired that he had nipped
round the back, helped Sir Roden
plant a memorial Chinese Elm, and
then seen him off the premises with
the official party. We, at that time, were
engrossed watching Nola Dekyvere pose
for pictures with Lieutenant Colonel
Barney’s stand-in.
Serves us jolly well right.


Florence: The Slow Recovery
From GEORGE BLACK
ALTHOUGH none of her half-
million citizens may be in a mood
to admit it, Florence has had a
providential escape from the floods
which swept over the city on the fatal
Friday, November 4. It will take 20
years of patient work, tjo make good
the losses suffered by her matchless,
artistic heritage, but by next spring
! most of the city’s famous works of art
-can again be on view.
An imaginative leap is needed at
present to see even a few months
ahead. Nearly 700 streets are still be-
mired. Thousands of troops, firemen,
iand police are struggling to clear a
mountain of debris and rubbish.
Museums, churches, monuments have
been engulfed in a tide of oil and dirt
which in some places has left a high-
water mark 15ft. above floor level.
Nevertheless, as a world art centre
Florence lives, and can still thrive
again. The damage, estimated at nearly
$155 million, is still a trifle compared
with what it might have been.
Nearly all the greatest works which
attract art-lovers to an area of the city
no larger than a village have been
spared. The masterpieces of Botticelli—
“ The Birth of Venus,” “The Allegory
of Spring,” and the Madonnas are
safe; so are the Leonardos, also in the
Uffizi Palace, the Caravaggios, Rem-
brandts, and Van Dyck portraits, with
all the rest of the collections on the
first and second floors. Damage at the
Uffizi was confined to a iew hundred
masters, mostly minor, which were
awaiting restoration on the lower floors.
These—mostly of the 12th century —
are now lined up on benches awaiting
expert attention.
In the magnificent Franciscan
Church of Santa Croce, mud and oil
lodge on the tombs of Italy’s illus-
trious dead. Giotto’s famous frescoes
much restored already were lap-
ped by the waters, but not seriously
harmed. I wish I could say the same
for the great 13th-century “Crucifixion”
of Cimabue, but great patches of paint
have been washed from the 15-foot-
high canvas. Most of the delicate
features have gone, alas, for ever.
On the other hand we can rejoice
at the recovery of the door panels
from the Romanesque, white-and-green
Baptistry in the Cathedral Square. The
-east door facing the cathedral
was declared by Michelangelo worthy
to be the gate of Paradise. Here, five
of Ghiberti’s ten gold-and-bronze
panels were stripped off by the flood.
Two other medallions from Pisano’s
south door were also torn away. Hap-
pily, all were found, damaged but
intact, as the flood began again to
subside.
Two superb statues by Donatello in
the Cathedral Museum are safe, but
14th-century illuminated manuscripts
have been destroyed, along with Bru-
nelleschi’s exquisite model of the cup-
ola. The original of Michelangelo’s
statue of David is intact at the
Academy Gallery among the Florentine
primitives, but the floor has subsided in
a dangerous way at some points.
Cimabue’s “Crucifixion,” dating from
the 13th century, irreparably damaged
by the Florence floods.
A valuable collection of ancient wind
and string instruments was under water
for some hours at the Bardini Museum,
but damage to its collection of marbles,
wood carvings, and terracottas has still
to be examined. In the Horne Museum
named after a British art-lover who
gave his lifetime’s' 1 collection to
Florence casualties include paintings
by Cranach, Beccafumi, and Leonar-
desco.
It seems —though I could not visit
them—that no harm has been done to
Michelangelo’s splendid Medici tombs,
with their massive, reclining sculptures
of dawn and dusk, at the Church of
San Lorenzo in the market square.
Giotto’s “Crucifixion” is also safe be-
hind the encrusted marble facade of
Santa Maria Novella.
TRAGEDY of yet unknown dimen-
sions has struck the Archaeological
Museum, where the main door has been
walled up with bricks and cement as a
temporary measure. Here water in-
vaded 42 rooms full of precious objects,
perhaps 10,000 of them. Ceilings are
said to have collapsed in two rooms
devoted to Etruscan tombs from Chiusi,
and many cases of bronze and ivory
relics are endangered. Until there is
time to cope with this area of devasta-
tion it must be left as it is.
I found the National Library, on the
Arno’s banks, filled with soldiers and
volunteers, including many foreign
students, trying to rescue the 200,000
valuable books and manuscripts. An-
other 150,000 volumes are being re-
covered from the Palazzo Strozzi, where
much ancient furniture and 400-year-
' old archives were submerged to a
depth of ten feet. Forty rooms full of
| State archives in a building opposite
the Uffizi Palace were also deluged
with mud. It is feared that hundreds
of thousands of documents are irretrievr
ably damaged.
Over in the Palazzo Strozzi, by
candlelight, I saw professor ' Carlq
Ragghianti from Pisa organising an
International Aid Committee which has
Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy as President.
Letters offering help are pouring in
from all over Italy and the world and
Ragghianti’s gratitude is beyond words.
Professor Molajoli, Director-General
of Antiquities, said: “For the moment
all we can safely undertake is to give
‘first aid’ to prevent irreparable loss
while we arrange to transport damaged
paintings to a ‘hospital’ for a definitive
cure.
“The Government has promised s2£
million for the first stage of the work.
We cannot act hastily. We must co-
ordinate and plan.”
The larger part of the 700 pictures
known to be damaged are medieval
paintings on wood. They have plaster
bases which, swollen with water, are
peeling away. Treatment is both dif-
ficult and dangerous.
“We’ve had to bring fresh water in*’
plastic containers from Rome to do the
most urgent job of clearing mud and
oil off,” said the Professor. “Working
around the clock at the Uffizi, we are
separating each picture from its wooden
plaque. Then it is placed between
sheets of mulberry paper with a special
adhesive which leaves no trace, but
prevents evaporation.
“Pictures so treated cannot be left
where they are, for humidity may
aggravate their condition. They must
be transferred to another building
where air-conditioners are being in-
stalled, so as to keep them at a steady
level of humidity until we are ready
to deal with them again. Then will
follow a controlled, slow-drying pro-
cess. It will take a good ten years to*
do all this.”
The authorities, both in Rome and
Florence, are more concerned than
they like to admit about the future
of Italy’s art capital. They face the
immense task of ensuring that build-
ings, monuments, and churches every-
where are safe, from their water-logged
foundations upwards. Many of the gal-
leries, like the Uffizi, could be opened
to the public in two or three months.
But nobody knows when the city around
them will return to anything like nor-
mal.


MARION RAYMOND'S COOKBOOK
First Catch Your Trout
IN our house there is usually an
abundance of trout. My husband’s
greatest pleasure is to sit in a boat
on Lake Eucumbene, thinking of noth-
ing except which lure he should use
to tempt the beautiful but crafty rain-
bows and browns. If he thinks about
anything else at all it can only be how,
once caught, the trout should be cooked.
When I first arrived in Australia we
spent three weeks travelling around the
foothills of the Snowy Mountains, sleep-
ing beside rivers where the platypus
played at dawn and at dusk. We even
managed to catch a few trout. Small,
delectable things.
Always prepared for an emergency
in the culinary field, I was armed with
a roll of foil, butter, salt, black pepper-
corns in a mill, garlic, and plenty of
white wine.
When the first trout was caught my
husband enthusiastically lit a fire, and
I only just managed to prevent him
from frying it.
Stuffed instead with a sliver of gar-
lic, seasoned with salt and pepper and
a nob of butter, the trout was placed
on a sheet of foil. A glass of wine
poured over it, a little more salt and
a sprinkling of pepper, another dab of
butter, the foil was tightly wrapped
around it, and into the embers it went.
Five minutes on each side.
In the meantime, we covered our
folding bridge table with a cloth, set
out the cutlery and glasses for the rest
of the wine, and demolished our trout
in style against the splendor of nature.
A fisherman nearby observed us with
undisguised horror. To prove our
point, we gave him a taste of the trout.
We would take any bets that he never
again goes fishing without garlic, butter,
wine, and foil —and might even remem-
ber the pepper-mill.
But lake trout need different treat-
ment. Because they feed mostly on
sub-aquatic fare (I’m told by the ex-
perts) their flesh is pinker and richer
than the poor river trout, which is
obliged to leap out of the water for its
insects. As the lake trout has all his
food virtually laid on, he soon gets
plump and big. But the flavor of his
flesh remains delicate, and he should be
cooked with tenderness.
You can wrap him up in foil arid
wine in the same way as the river
trout, adding a few chopped shallots
and a couple of sliced mushrooms—not
too many, otherwise the delicate flavor
is lost. Heat the oven to 375 deg., place
the trout on a flat tray, and leave to
simmer. Allow 25 minutes for a
fish. Small peas and new potatoes
should be the only accompaniment.
If you feel like going to a bit more
trouble, omit the mushrooms and serve
with a sauce. Grate a fresh cucumber,
drain off most of the water, mix the
pulp with a little sour cream, and add
some very small shelled prawns. Season
and add a squeeze of lemon to taste.
Warm gently (do not allow to boil)
and pour over trout.
We rather like a Scandinavian way
of preparing trout. Apparently the
Vikings used to clean their trout, dig a
hole in a special kind of mud, and bury
the poor thing for a few days. No air
was permitted to enter; otherwise you
ate the trout with your life in peril.
This recipe is derived from that
method. Only the trout is so thoroughly
pickled that your life is in no way
endangered.
You have to be adept with a knife
or be friendly with your fishmonger.
The trout is cleaned and filleted off the
bone on both sides, its skin being in no
way damaged. The fish is then placed
in an earthenware or glass dish and
sprinkled with a mixture of salt and
sugar (one tablespoon of each), a little
ground pepper, and a good dusting of
tarragon and dill. (If you can get the
fresh variety, so much the better.)
Fold the two halves together and top
with a half-bbttle of cooking brandy.
Let the trout swim in that, gently
turning it from time to time, for 48
hours. You keep it in the refrigerator,
covered with foil. You’ll find that the
trout has literally drunk most of the
brandy before you get round to eating
it.
To serve, drain and wash briefly,,
then slice thinly, like smoked salmon.
(Make sloping cuts, starting at the
head, leaving the skin exposed as you
go. You may have to remove a few
rib bones to begin with.) We like it
served with brown bread and butter
and a squeeze of lemon. You might
also try it on buttered pumpernickel,
with a sprinkle of finely chopped chives.
Like the Vikings, you’ll want it again
and again.
A Book of Wine, and Thou...
WHEN the first
article b y
Cellarmaster
appeared in THE
BULLETIN, it was
clear that there was
a notable new wine
writer on the scene.
Like some others, I
became a regular
reader of the Cel-
larmaster articles, which have gone
from strength to strength. Now they
have been assembled into a small book,
by Len Evans, as spritzig, as sparkling
as any of the wines he has reviewed.
Since the first Cellarmaster articles,
I have met Evans, enjoyed his com-
pany at the Friday Club, watched
amazed at the speed and breadth of
his acquisition of wine knowledge, be-
come an admirer of his energy and
promotional talent, had his help at my
vineyard on numerous occasions (even
to the stamping of the first Cabernet-
tinea wine this year), and come to
value his friendship. His influence on
Australian wine at the consumer’s level
has been prodigious, and the principal
reason for this has been the Cellar-
master articles.
They have now been revised and
grouped into categories (sadly without
an index) in one pocket-sized volume,
which will repay more than one read-
ing.
His attitude to wine is a beauty. A
deflater of pretension, an ardent en-
thusiast, his influence on the enjoyment
of wine must be for the best. There
is so much to learn in this lighthearted
approach, with its core of good sound
stuff on many Australian wines, and a
unique style, leavened with some reason-
able puns, e.g., “spaghetti leftoveri”
(not to be confused with the right one).
Evans would be one of the greatest
promoters this country has seen, and
anyone who can read this book and
not wish to sit over a glass with him,
or swop wine stories, must be pretty
sombre.
There is so much to learn here. If
you really want to improve your know-
ledge a masked tasting (away from
even the bottles) will teach you to be
honest with yourself, and true to your
own palate. The description of a tasting
by the Viticultural Society of Victoria
is the best example. It is vital, if you
wish to learn, to have your own opinions,
and to compare them with the wine
involved, and not be afraid to be
wrong.
For me, the most important chapter
in the book was on the new plantings,
but each reader will find much of
permanent value throughout the book.
Cellarmaster has performed a great
service to many of the lesser-known
sections .of the wine trade. His approba-
tion of the Victorian liqueur muscats
highlights our neglect of some of
the top wines in this country,
and the publicising of such unique
beverages as Marnique, the superb
Berri Coop’s quince liqueur, Hen-
schke’s marvellous labels, and so on.
Wine service is dealt with, what wine
with what food, and a list is given of
standard commercial wines which are
always reliablej and always of very high
quality. Agreement about top developed

500,000,000 tons of iron ore ?
You’re looking at it. All in one mountain. Mt. Tom Price,
in the Hamersley Range in north-west Western Australia,
is literally made of iron-ore - more than 500 million tons
of it. And this is only one deposit. Many more are still
waiting to be mined and processed. This is where Australia’s
future lies - in the vast areas “back of beyond” that have
suddenly become very much alive.
A short time ago, the only sound to be heard was wind
through the stunted scrub. Now, you’ll hear the roar of
trucks, the pounding of heavy machinery and the throb of
diesel locomotives. This remote area has become vitally
important to the nation’s economic development - due
largely to the efforts of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia.
CRA geologists prospected this rich region. Then CRA
engineers went in with all their equipment. They built a
port with its town, a mine with its town, and a 182-mile
rail link between the two. In just twenty months, more
than $lOO million was spent on the development of the
Hamersley Iron project, and this was just the beginning.
Phase two - an iron pellet plant is now under construction.
Phase three - the commissioning of other segments of an
iron and steel industry is yet to come.
Australia has so much iron-ore that she could supply the
needs of the world’s blast furnaces for years. This mineral
wealth, so recently discovered, means an expanding
economy, and a prosperous and exciting future for all
Australians - and many benefits for millions of people in
dozens of other countries around the world.

This Marion shovel fills gigantic Dart trucks, which carry 100 tons per load of ore down the mountain to the primary
crusher. The ore is reduced to pieces 7" in diameter, stockpiled, taken by conveyors for screening, then to finer crushers. Finally,
it is deposited above the rail load-out tunnel.

In just 45 seconds, two rail trucks
filled with ore are locked into this
rotary dumper, and turned through
180 0 to dump their 200 tons of ore
into a conveyor. The conveyors take
the ore either to a stockpile or direct
to a ship.
The new port of Dampier handles
ships of 65,000 tons DWT, and soon
will accept much larger shipping. The
ship loader above can pour over 6,000
tons per hour into the holds. It is from

- to benefit not only Australians, but

Every night, a l\ mile long train leaves Mt. Tom Price on its 182-mile trip to the coast along the heavy-duty track. Each
train carries up to 20,000 tons.
ORA
Shipments of Hamersley ore started in August 1966. And sales contracts for millions
of tons have been arranged with steel mills in Japan, the United Kingdom and in
Europe. By 1970, Hamersley Iron Pty. Limited, 60% owned by CRA and 40%
by Kaiser Steel Corporation, will be shipping iron-ore and pellets worth over $5O
million a year and this figure will rise steadily.
The whole achievement is one of which all Australians can be justifiably proud.

quality in wine is not as uncommon
among wine men as might be expected.
There is some amazing. information,
such as on love potions (e.g., visiting
Tahbilk and Milawa on the same day,
or rocquefort cheese with red wine).
“The most appealing thing about
wine? Nose, color, taste, and flavor,
body, finish, balance, tradition.” Cel-
larmaster’s summary is the nub of any
wine’s attraction. The bit about
crusts and sediments must be very
helpful to the beginner, and if you
intend starting your own cellar there
is much of value here. His inability
to keep up his cellar book is noted with
regret, as such a book is a must for
your widow’s and children’s guidance.
Regarding the service of champagne
with food, Cellarmaster might heed the
following suggestion when the royalty
cheques for this work come rolling in.
On just one occasion, that champagne
be served right through the meal from
aperitif to departure, as this can be
an unforgettable experience; and foi
a feeling of completely abandoned
luxury sip an iced brut in the shade
on a hot summer noon. A worthwhile
ambition, anyhow.
0 F course, there are some points of
difference. I cannot be half-hearted
in my praise of Houghton’s white bur-
gundy (which incidentally was the first
Australian-labelled white burgundy,
e.g., 1954) and, as Cellarmaster often
makes comparison with Old World
wines, how can one tell this from an
estate Chassagne Montrachet, and what
marvellous'development the ’54 Hough-
ton showed over the subsequent ten
years, in complexity of flavor? And
he would be the first to agree that the
chablis styles of the Hunter and Great
Western show marked white burgundy
development of flavor after many years
of bottle age. I fail to see any real
chablis or white burgundy character
in most of the great Tahbilk Marsanne.
If it has to be compared to a French
wine, it is much closer to one of the
best Loire styles, e.g., Sancerre or
Montlouise. But this sort of argument is
best kept for a good bottle and plenty
of leisure time.
I would have liked to see more about
the great Seppelts Cabernets, the
fruity Cabernets of Orlando in the
Barossa, and the true Bordeaux styles
of the Redmans of Coonawarra. How-
ever, it is much easier to criticise than
create.
So there it is. Hyphenated adjec-
tives, enthusiastic, almost breathless
style, which carries the reader along,
“knocked into some sort of sequence,
and new chapters written,” is Cellar-
master’s guide to Australian wines. A
must for the beginner, there is much
of interest to the connoisseur. Eighty
pages for one dollar fifty, it is highly
recommended.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Sounds and Space
By MICHAEL BAUME
IT will take some major redesigning
of the larger hail, but two of the
Sydney Opera House’s key con-
sultants agree that the seating prob-
lem can be solved. And this could be
done with an improvement in the
acoustic conditions for concerts on
those aimed at in Utzon’s plans.
The chances of getting at least 2500
people into the Opera House major
hall and possibly a few more
are now very high. This is still not
up to the 2800 the Australian Broad-
casting Commission ideally wants, but
the final figure may not fall far short
of this. The plans which Utzon left
behind had squeezed 2500 seats in
front of the orchestra in narrow rows,
in a space that the new design team
said could fit only 1800 in reasonable
comfort.
Two key consultants to the project
who are now visiting Australia, Danish
acoustician Dr. V. L. Jordan and the
American adviser on theatre design,
Mr. Ben Schlanger, agree that a sub-
stantial increase in seating under com-
fortable spacing conditions can be made
by redesigning the space available
under the shells.
Dr. Jordan, whom Utzon employed
nine years ago, is believed to have
told the Government that it is feasible
to achieve the 2800 seat requirement
of the ABC within the volume available
beneath the roof sails.
“I think we’ve found our white elephant.”
But this would involve a significant
change in the layout of the hall, such
as a revised design of the whole, ceiling
area, and the use of the front part of
the stage area for seating.
He also says that the desired concert
hall reverberation time of two seconds
is feasible (instead of Utzon’s proposed
1.7 seconds), and that the major hall
should be acoustically fine in the plan
the design architect, Mr. Peter Hall, is
working on, without resorting to any
means of general electronic assistance.
He thinks that stage arrangements
could be made to fit choir seating and
an organ within an acoustically accept-
able scheme.
But Dr. Jordan seems far from happy
about the question of keeping outside
noises from the hall, and is believed to
have suggested that there should be
improvements in insulation of the
'acoustically weak areas such as the
glass and louvre walls.
Mr. Schlanger, who, like Dr. Jordan,
is here for a couple of weeks, is looking
at the Opera House seating question
as a new problem, not the correction
of old mistakes.
In the few days he has been on the
job in Sydney, Mr. Schlanger (who was
associated with the design of most re-
cent major U.S. theatres, the Lincoln
Centre, and other performing arts pro-
jects, and who was appointed, on Mr.
Hall’s recommendation, in October for
$18,000) has become aware of the
major problems involved in designing
the interior of the halls for audience
needs.
He is, in effect, telling the architec-
tural panel what an audience will need
and how those needs could be met in
this hall, and is collaborating in the
design.
He also is concerned with the ques-
tion of circulation of people around
the building, and presumably the sug-
gestions made by some Sydney archi-
tects in the past about escalators to
help carry the audience up parts of the
way may once again be raised (some
members of the audience would other-
wise have to walk up the equivalent of
a six-storey building).
The present two weeks of collabora-
tion between these three men Peter
Hall the architect, Dr. Jordan the
acoustician, and Mr. Schlanger the ex-
pert in the movement and placing of
people—are vital to the future of the
insides, the real “guts,” of the Opera
House, not only of the major hall but
also of the inner hall which may face
significant alterations to its dimensions.
Nationalistic
Blackmail
WE just can’t afford his kind
of money,” said the men at
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust.
So, Mr. Denis Vaughan, principal
conductor of the recently concluded
and'highly successful, in musical terms
—opera season, will not be back to
run next year’s. Vaughan left Aus-
tralia last week after negotiations to
engage him as musical director of next
year’s Opera Season broke down on
the simple question of money.
Vaughan says that he could not
afford to work for the fees offered by
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, and
that the main reason he took the con-
ducting job this year was because he
wanted to come home to Melbourne
to see his family. He says that all
he received for 4£ months’ work in
Australia was a basic sum of $4OOO,
and additional fees of $1620, plus an
overseas air fare—but with no accom-
modation expenses inside Australia.
He considers it absurd that Austra-
lian musicians on the international cir-
cuits should be expected to accept
cut rates to come back home for a
season; it is a sort of nationalistic
blackmail.
The proposal he put to the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust for next year
was that as musical director he should
receive the sum of $24,000 dollars for
26 weeks. For this he would prepare
and control the musical part of the
Opera Season: casting, programming,
and musical direction in the pit, con-
ducting at least 65 performances.
“Vaughan’s terms are reasonable for
international circuits, but they are not
ours,” a Trust executive said last week.
The rate Vaughan wanted, about $4OOO
a month, was, the spokesman esti-

mated, about 2£ times what the Trust
can afford to pay.
Vaughan not only denies his rates
are too high, but also stresses that
they are even acceptable locally, being
in line with what the ABC pays for
good-quality resident conductors for a
season of only 14 weeks in charge of
one of the major orchestras. And,
Vaughan claims, the Trust talks in
terms of this sort of money when dis-
cussing bringing top European singers
here at between $l5OO and $3OOO a
performance.
The decision not to hire Mr.
Vaughan was taken by the Board of
Directors of the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust, not simply by the Opera Com-
pany, although, no doubt, its recom-
mendation would have been that the
fee was too high.
But the Trust board did not negoti-
ate with Mr. Vaughan; it did not even
make a firm offer setting out what it
would pay him. All that went on was
a letter from Vaughan saying what he
wanted, and some discussions with
executive officers of the Trust.
Denis Vaughan.
The Trust board had to decide on
the question, because his requested
terms could not be accommodated
within the existing Opera budget.
Vaughan is convinced the money is
there; he thinks that if the Opera
House is to be used for opera, then
one lottery in three should go toward
creating an opera orchestra and main-
taining an opera company; he thinks
it wrong for Australia to keep on try-
ing to get opera on the cheap.
He is ambitious for Sydney music
(and he is frankly ambitious for Denis
Vaughan, too).
But he has trodden on a few toes.
He wants to start an Opera House
orchestra that would rival the Sydney
Symphony it may be a coincidence
that he was not asked to conduct the
major city orchestras for the ABC even
in studio concerts on this trip.
Vaughan hopes to come back one
day, once a firmer basis for the general
financing of the Elizabethan’s Opera
Company has been set up. But like so
many Australians who have succeeded
overseas (including one or two first-rate
singers in the recent season), he finds
that his own country is not prepared to
pay what others will for his services.

THE new “Seraglio” is in my mind
the best to date. Individual com-
ponents may have been excelled
in the past; the whole has not.
Fritz Wunderlich’s tragic death last
September probably made his Belmonte
the last complete part he recorded. It
is a worthy memorial, though his
Tamino was even better. Erika Koeth
is an excellent lightweight Konstanze,
Kurt Boehme’s wobble is happily
absent, and two new singers, Lotte
Schaedle and Friedrich Lenz, are
pleasant enough as Blonde and Ped-
rillo. Eugen Jochum’s conducting is
exactly as any Mozart-lover would
wish, and the recording quality is fine.
The opera has been recorded on four-
and-a-quarter sides, leaving nearly a
whole disc for the first stereo, “Bastien
und Bastienne,” which was not the
first, but the second (!) opera com-
pleted by the 12-year-old Mozart. It
is a lovely trifle, extremely well per-
formed, but one which could be an
unwanted addition to a set which
should have been accommodated on
two discs.
Strauss’ “Four Last Songs,” with full
symphonic accompaniments, are almost
operatic in feeling, hence their inclusion
here. To review the disc is easy.
Soloist, orchestra, conductor, record-
ing, and music are perfect. A rare disc
not to be missed on any account.

MUSIC
Heard But Not Seen
Jose Kahan. Sydney Conservatorium.
IT is an irrationally purist yet persist-
ing myth that the finest way to
experience music is simply to listen
and not to look. Perhaps it was with
this in mind that the organisers of the
recital given by the visiting Mexican
pianist Jose Kahan took care to ensure
that my seat was in a position which
restricted the view to a Steinway’s
backside and a fleeting glimpse or two
of the soloist’s head. I may say that
Mr. Kahan has a superb pedalling tech-
nique, but how he solved the fingering
problems of his deliberately virtuostic
program I can only guess.
Kahan is a musician who obviously
measures out his repertoire in fistfuls.
The Brahms Sonata No. 3 in F Minor
—the centrepiece of the evening—is an
early work which reveals the composer
at his “blackest.” It must have more
notes and expression marks to the
bar than any other comparable sonata.
Attacking the opening Allegro maestoso
with high-romantic vigor, Kahan
squeezed every possible drop of melan-
cholia from the movement. An exces-
sive legato consistently smudged what
could have been concise and intelligent
phrasing. In its gruff, percussive nature,
the Finale escaped this tendency toward
syrupy presentation and, in doing so,
emphasised the most annoying charac-
teristic of the recital as a whole: Kahan
played with impressive technical
fluency and bravura, but his grasp of
the music seemed facile and shallow.
Fortunately, he chose few pieces
which would suffer unduly from this
lack of interpretative insight. While
in the Spanish-American works of
Ponce, Chavez, and Ginastera there is
little artistic merit, their qualities as
extravaganzas cannot be overlooked.
Kahan negotiated the asthmatic
polyphony of Ponce’s Prelude and
Fugue with dazzling left-hand speed,
and in the “Malambo” of Ginastera
displayed an attractive ability in syn-
chronising rapid passage work.
The selections of Chopin—the C
Sharp Minor Prelude (Op. 45) and
the Polonaise No. 5 in F Sharp Minor
(Op. 44) —were the most accomplished
and enjoyable performances of the
evening. The Prelude brooded in all
its suppressed intensity, while the
Polonaise strutted and sang. Here, as
in the remainder of the program,
Kalian’s sense of rhythm emerged as
his most valuable gift.

A Phoenix Too Frequent, Christopher
Fry; The Collection, Pinter; Passion,
Poison and Petrifaction, G. B. Shaw.
St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Front. Emerald Hill, Mel-
bourne.
AS the multiplication of sets, plots,
costumes, and dramatis personae
minimises the dangers of bore-
dom, I’ll vote for the party that
promises more one-act plays. Take
St. Martin’s offerings. They are all
comedies about marital infidelity, and
they couldn’t be more diverse.
Fry sets his play in a tomb, where
an angelic wife and her bawdy maid
mourn the late Virilius, while nobly
awaiting their own demise. A young
soldier stumbles on them, bringing
worldly temptations that undermine
their desire for self-sacrifice. Although
his style has dated, Fry’s wit is sur-
prisingly durable, and Gerda Nicolson,
Jennifer Hagan, and John Rickard
display it well. The set by Paul Kath-
ner is pure John Piper.
Like “Rashomon,” Pinter’s play is
concerned with conflicting versions of
a sexual encounter. But where “Rasho-
mon” proceeded to reveal the truth,
“The Collection” hides it in an enigma.
Pinter’s fascination lies in his ability
to conjure with tension and ambiguity,
to write plays which hint at depths
they simply don’t possess. And, of
them, “The Collection” is one of the
slightest. Like a bubble, it is just so
much surface tension around empty
air. But Keith Lee, Jennifer Claire,
Peter Drake, and Peter Adams keep it
skilfully aloft and make it the night’s
major success.
Snaw wrote “Petrifaction” when he
was a young man of 51. A few min-
utes of Edwardian goonery, in which
angels sing “Bill Bailey” while actors
hurl boots at the ceiling, it was written
as an entertainment for an actors’
orphanage fund garden party. And I’m
sure GBS would have been just as
embarrassed as we were with its re-
vival.
The most lively revues I’ve seen
have been fringe productions presented
by university students for their ilk, by
queers for their peers, or by Lefties
for their fellow-travellers. Because, as
well as an intimate theatre audience, to
really jell, a revue needs an intimate
audience.
If those on both sides of the curtain
share an attitude of an environment,
they meet more than halfway as glee-
ful conspirators. This explains why
“A Funny Thing” is so successful. It
is the most conspiratorial revue we’ve
had in years.
The sketches range from the simple,
animated political cartoon (a be-
flippered Harold writhes voluptuously
in the folds of Old Glory, to extracts
from that aberrated masterpiece “Catch
22”; officers with Foster’s lager labels
for cap badges hold grotesque court-
martials; “I Love Aeroplane Jelly” be-
comes a hymn to napalm; Gough buries
Arthur; the Chinese dog-paddle toward
Darwin; the birthday marbles are re-
placed with aniseed balls; and through
it all Harold grins like a Cheshire cat.
In closing, I am pleased to announce
verification of Adams’ law. From the
outer darkness, in which I recently
found myself, I now propound it: “The
Distance of the Critic’s Seat from the
Stage is Inversely Proportional to the
Warmth of his Previous Notice.”

MARRIAGE and its difficulties is
, the perennial subject of Broad-
way comedies. The setting is
invariably an apartment in New York,
whether it be Uptown, Downtown, East
Side, West Side, Greenwich Village,
Brooklyn or the Bronx.
With inspired ingenuity, Murray
Schisgal has shifted his marriage
comedy into avant-garde territory. He
has taken it out of the apartment, with
its chairs and cushions and flowers and
martinis and the telephone, and has
set it on a bridge, furnished only with
a bench and a litter basket. In the
misty background loops of lights hazily
define the outlines of other bridges,
suggesting a vast metropolis. This set-
ting, attractively designed by Richard
Casler, evokes the kind of loneliness,
metaphysical as well as physical, which
is characteristic of avant-garde drama.

beth,” which has now opened its Syd-
ney season at the Tivoli. When the
musical opened in Melbourne, Phillip
Adams wrote: “The show will, of
course, be a thumping success. The
ingredients are proven and the produc-
tion unstinting.”
figure, with moustache and baggy
trousers, prepares to hurl himself from
the parapet. Saved by his old classmate,
Milt Manville, who recognises him after
15 years, Harry Berlin explains that
he has been overcome by the meaning-
lessness and loneliness of it all. His
feeling of total rejection was confirmed
when a stray dog mistook him for a
convenient lamp post. Milt, on the
other hand, explains that he is rich,
successful, and in love. All he needs
for complete happiness is to get rid of
his present wife, Ellen, so that he can
marry his new love. Then, seized with
inspiration, he passes Ellen on to
Harry.
In the second half the situation is
reversed, with Milt trying to retrieve
Ellen and drown the unsinkable
Harry.
For the American producer lan
Cadenhead this new style of domestic
comedy presents the same problem as
the avant-garde comedies have pre-
sented to local producers: new-style
comedies need old-style comedians,
masters of timing and movement.
In Mark McManus, who plays the
drooping-moustached, baggy-trousered
Harry Berlin, this production has a
natural comedian. Alastair Duncan
(Milt) is a skilful actor who attacks
his role with energy, but he is a charac-
ter actor not a comedian. Diana David-
son gives the impression that she would
have been more at home in the apart-
ment in the orthodox domestic comedy,
but is ill at ease, lacking in zaniness
out on the bridge in farce.
“Pirates at the Barn” is set at Mos-
man’s Bay, as it was then called, in
1839, when Mr. Archibald Mosman’s
whaling station occupied this lonely
spot. It is an exciting story of how
Kathy, adopted daughter of that shady
pair, Mr. and Mrs. Snizzle, helps to
catch the pirates and outwit the evil-
tempered Black Bill Bluster.
Maria Iwanoczko gives a spirited per-
formance as the brave and resourceful
Kathy, who refuses to be frightened
even by the villainously bearded Black
Bill (Lionel Haft). The somewhat
ragged production at the opening
matinee will, it seems reasonable to
hope, be polished up within a few
weeks.

funny. A civil engineer in an English
colony builds a dam across a river,
only to find that by doing so he has
killed the local god. With the help
of his wife and secretary, he sets about
creating a replacement, the name of
which is Moo. He creates Moo’s ethical
code, his wife writes Moo’s Book of
Revelations, and the secretary composes
the liturgical music. Two years later,
in the second act, we find that the
three have become devotees of the
religion, which at that time is passing
through a period of human sacrifice,
and the act ends with a lawyer and
his clerk being polished off at vespers.
The third act is “many years later,”
and Moo is now fully established. It
has adherents in the British Army,
cities, cathedrals, pniversities, and an
ordained priesthood. The play ends
with the engineer’s son, a Moo priest,
proclaiming that the worship of Moo
has taken the wrong turn, has lost the
true path. He prepares to enter the
wilderness, where he will preach a re-
turn to the true Moo faith.
The plot is superficially ingenious. It
is really the kind of play Shaw would
have loved to re-write. As it stands,
it could be described as an elaborated
drawing-room comedy. Colin Ballan-
tyne has rightly directed it on the sur-
face, and at a pace which disguises
the textual and conceptual shallowness.
It contains a collection of “Ballan-
tyne” caricatures: an over-agitated,
officious Colonial Public Servant, a
brittle picture-hatted wife, thin Etonian
secretary, a bending and shyly servile
manservant. All are conceived in
broadly comic terms, and if they do
not fully achieve the British manner
they .make up the loss in vigor.

THE ABC has restored “Forum” to
the air, unfortunately, pretty
much in its old form one
speaker addresses an audience which
questions him, timed by a chairman
who has a little bell. The first-night
speaker was Donald McLean, head-
master, novelist, journalist, who within
a few minutes declared that N.S.W.’s
new Wyndham educational scheme was
already outdated by automation, which
was changing many concepts faster than
official minds could grasp concepts
of economic growth (rocketing), and of
educational needs (for the age of
leisure, which was not coming but was
upon us). It was all set out in a little
book which Mr. McLean waved occa-
sionally. I gathered it was one Mr.
Calwell might like to get his hands on.
The audience was composed of elite
high-school boys, widely representa-
tive P. and C. delegates, teachers from
the Federation and private schools,
and a professor who was amazed by
Mr. McLean’s switch from advocate
of the secondary-education scheme to
condemnor of it. The surprise was
general. None in the audience was
prepared, it seemed, for the revolu-
tionary subject matter. This and
“Forum’s” way of giving the speaker
the final word after each question,
enabled Mr. McLean to punch home
his message. “We’re going ahead with
this campaign,” he said, enlarging its
horizon. Twice the chairman tinged
his bell as Mr. McLean paused for
breath or reflection, and twice he was
.rebuked with a firm, “I haven’t fin-
ished.”
Nor should Mr. McLean be finished
if the matter is as he says. Mr. McLean
called for an immediate leaving age
of 18; schools without grades and only
one, final, examination; not education
for jobs about to vanish, but for useful
occupation of tomorrow’s leisure. This
is not nonsense, but the day may be
much further off, in Australia, than
Mr. McLean thinks. It deserves much
more discussion, and soon.
The small child who appeared in
the first of a new series of five BBC
“Comedy Playhouse” episodes last week
had no leisure problem. He was the
tax expert for his father’s business. As
a scholar, he had won an afternoon
with the author of the “Pudgy” tales,
whose usual taxman was in prison.
After the child had read from his
prizewinning thesis a psycho-analysis
of “Pudgy” and its creator —the author
(Hermione Gingold) asked in fruity
tones, “How long have you been im-
personating a child, Mr. Plowman?”
Written by a new pair of comedy
writers (when will we ever learn?), it
was a very funny half-hour. Fortunately
the series is bound to be repeated,
and next time I hope to understand
all of Miss Gingold’s extraordinary de-
livery.
There was no “Mr. Plowman” in
“Showcase ’66,” which ended this
week; but the talented young were well
represented by a boy named Michael
Kluger, who apparently does many
things well and who made the finals
with virtuoso performances on a piano-
accordion almost as big as himself.
Although this show’s first 20-odd weeks
were roughly as entertaining as the
floorshow on a tourist bus, the finals
had their moments of glorv in the
violin playing of Pamela Bryce, the
singing of John Byers, and Michael
Kluger’s way with his normally dread-
ful instrument.
Compere Gordon Boyd likened him
to Larry Adler with the harmonica,
and I would be willing to concede
that if Mr. Boyd would agree that
the first 20 or so heats should be held
in camera. They won’t. I know, be-
cause applications for “Showcase ’67”
are already closed. At a guess, all 500
of them; of whom 300 will be elimi-
nated. There are small blessings.

The Agony and the Ecstasy. Director:
Carol Reed.
Anatomy of a Marriage. Director: Andre
Cayatte.
IN the prologue to “The Agony and
the Ecstasy,” the camera roves
slowly and lovingly over Rome and
Florence and the works of Michael-
angelo. Beautifully photographed, in-
spiring to watch, with a mercifully un-
obtrusive if not very profound com-
mentary, this sequence tells all you
need to know about the artist. It was,
I believe, tacked on as an afterthought
and not even directed by Carol Reed,
but it is more eloquent in its few
minutes than Reed manages to be in
some two hours.
I suppose it is something of a feat,
in an inverted way, to remove all
vitality and conviction from the story
of a turbulent genius in a lusty, violent
age. Thank heaven Reed doesn’t try
to cover the whole of Michaelangelo’s
life (he lived to almost 90; as portrayed
in this film he’d have expired of sheer
boredom years before). “The Agony
and the Ecstasy” concentrates on the
years when, despite political upheavals
and frequent quarrels with his patron,
Pope Julius 11, he painted the frescoes
in the Sistine Chapel.
Ogden Nash, in a verse about the
disadvantages of a sense of humor,
points out that Michaelangelo could
never have painted the frescoes if he’d
stopped to think how absurd he looked
lying there with his stomach on the
ceiling. In this regard, if no other,
Reed’s film is thoroughly accurate:
there is no gleam of humor in the
reverent treatment or in Charlton
Heston’s ponderously respectful per-
formance, in which craggy nobility
takes the place of vitality.
Nor does Heston ever convince that
he’d be capable of drawing a straight
line; and, though we are treated to
interminable scenes with him at work
on the Sistine frescoes, what he is doing
looks suspiciously like what used to
be known at my primary school as
“coloring-in.”
Even that lively player Rex Harri-
son as the warrior-Pope succumbs to
the prevailing inertia, and what should
be the resounding clash of two vol-
canic, autocratic personalities is more
reminiscent of the bickerings of a
couple of cranky bachelors about the
new curtains for their home unit.
A story not worth telling once isn’t
improved by being told twice, even
from different viewpoints. “Anatomy
of a Marriage” is like one of those
magazine articles called “Can This
Marriage Be Saved?” in which the
estranged parties give their version of
the split-up, each one sounding like a
long-suffering, persecuted saint finally
driven to breaking-point by the others
misdoings. The pair in the film,
equally unlikable, self-deluded, and
uninteresting, obviously make an ideal
couple they richly deserve each
other.
It is almost unbelievable that an ex-
perienced and often exciting director
like Cayatte should be responsible for
this, for apart from its dull and silly
script it is amateurish in execution.
Nor do the players help; they all look
to be acting very poorly and the sound
is horribly dubbed into English. Oddly
enough, one of the production com-
panies involved in this mournful, whin-
ing movie is called “Jolly Films.”

Cantlon’s sketches of Paddington, which
social realists once rendered as a
proletarian fortress, make it a snow-
white, virginal suburb outlined by
smudges of sinful soot. Perhaps his
houses are the timid ghosts of a
departed Paddington, but one prefers
Sali Herman’s robust rehabilitation of
the areas, once carelessly called slums.
Others want to look more intense.
Once, Bob Dickerson could pack his
flat, crisp areas with bitter poignancy
and enclose his dejected people with
walls that seemed to run to infinities
of suffering and endurance. In his
present set of charcoal drawings people
emerge from a blackness no more
meaningful than a velvet backdrop and
he adopts conventions that imprison
his skill in conveying bitterness, isola-
tion, and a mournfulness just saved
from defeatism by a defiant will to sur-
vive. He has peaked eyebrows, twin-
peaked top-lips, peaked chins on all his
peaky children, who sometimes reveal
some anguish,, adolescent anxiety, and
glances from the slough of despond,
but are too often full of cloying, senti-
mental self-pity. The hands, clenched,
groped, groping, help recall
his former power of showing people
hanging on by the skin of their teeth.
The fangs are out in Jamieson, a
Queensland painter, flamboyantly
amalgamating Kirchner with Melanesia
with such expressionist turbulence that
subtle nuances peep in only on the
“Yellow Box,” where the rough grey
tree is lit with radiating yellow boughs.
Most of the time his art is raw, red
in tooth and claw. Black animals, with
green, red, or blue eyes, converge on
something scarlet with obscene greed;
a monstrous black hound is a barbar-
ously ferocious symbol against a tor-
tured yellow sky; and a rider hurtles
through violent reds and greens on an
apocalyptic chariot. “The Drunkard,”
owing something to Melanesian masks,
black - faced and yellow - fanged,
hardly emerges from a chaos of intoxi-
cated color; but, though Jamieson
makes a lot of other painting look
effete, timorous, and precious, the
apocalyptic is close to the uncontrolled
apoplectic. Still, he is a refreshingly
daring and impetuous painter, in a bit
of a rage against all the cool, hard-
edge cats.
John Firth-Smith, only 23, is cool-
ing down early; only recently he was
lassoing unkempt orchards and forests
with a wild calligraphy and his collage
used to be strewn like flotsam and
jetsam, but now, in a series on the
harbor in opaque blue-green, his line,
once as expressively awkward as
Olsen’s, has the swift elegance of White-
ley’s arabesques, and his collage, mainly
of billowing sails, are neatly scissored
and exquisitely placed. Even the
obtrusive phallic symbols, come down
to the seashore for no obvious reason,
have a delicate linear ease. Just out for
a bit of sunshine.
weave sinuously about the
waters, trace out a Whiteley nude
here, a fluid leg there, but the collages
of sails, boats, and butterflies check any
tendency to slick fluency, and the flat,
inert sea is animated by clear-cut sails.
His harbor is not a cruel sea but a stage
for nautical gymnasts; it epitomises the
cool, calculated pleasures. He has
domesticated the harbor.
Kevin Connor, who, after a year in
Europe, has just departed for U.S.A.,
has tamed the distortion of his heads,
but has by no means domesticated
them. The color, less insistent, is more
lyrical and the forms are more monu-
mental. The visions of Nolan and
Bacon still impel him: “Study for Por-
trait I” is taken from Bacon’s study
for a life-mask of William Blake, and
the melting, suffusing of features from
Nolan’s recent heads of women. But
there are important differences: Nolan
is having fun with types; Bacon horri-
fies with flesh . that proliferates like
blobs of gelatine; Bacon’s cheekbones
and eye-sockets writhe, his hopes
scream, and his businessmen in blue
businessmen’s strait jackets disintegrate
in airless rooms. Over the first shock
of Connor’s elongated heads and drift-
ing features, one realises that his heads
are really candy-colored flesh tones
suffusing most pleasantly as they
effectively present the transience of
flesh and form.
They are quite haunting and beauti-
ful works, but the people they present
are too anonymous, the experiences
involved too generalised. Indeed, the
five realists on view need the urgency
and the impact that particularity can
give like a girl with a bouquet
of flowers by Blackman or a hatchet
head reduced to rocky bone and sinew
by Tucker.

THE
ARTIST
AND
GOD
A SHORT STORY By GWEN KELLY
OUR suburb is a normal one the
Sydney microcosm of a country
town; a line of shops in the
main street, angle-parked cars, red-
tiled, red-brick cottages, and a skyline
spotted here and there with churches.
To most people in our community the
churches are not important, only the
Catholic Church is ever full, yet in
essence ours is a Protestant community,
perhaps more exactly a non-conformist
community, for even the Anglicans are
Low.
My own little sector of the micro-
cosm does go to church on Sunday,
usually three times if you count Sun-
day school; not because we lack enter-
tainment, as is so often the case in our
rural counterpart, but because we be-
lieve in God. Margaret believed in
God, too, but unlike most of us she
also believed in Art, both of them with
capitals. She believed in Art because
she had been born an artist, she be-
lieved in God because she had been
brought up a Christian. Even as a baby,
she lay in her pram on the church
porch and wailed, while the evange-
list within thundered that Sin destroys
and Christ saves.
Being an artist of a minor sort my-
self, I watched with curiosity the artist
develop haphazardly from an innate
love of line, form, and color to a con-
scious pursuit in the face of a totally
uninterested family of good .art.
“Look, Mr. Jones, look.” Her stringy
plaits flapped around her scrawny face.
Even at eight she was not beautiful, but
her over-large features were redeemed
by the emotional eyes of the incipient
fanatic. “Gulls like paper boats on the
sea” and she clutched the pad between
her knees and sketched them, a flotilla
bobbing on the water.
“That I had the wings of a dove,”
I said.
“O my dove,” she answered, “let me
hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice.”
And skilled was her hand, but her
parents barely noticed. Her father
worked in a bank, pounds, shillings, and
pence, the reward of the godly as well
as the snare of the wicked. “St. Paul,”
said father, “condemned the love of
money, not money itself. All is sancti-
fied if used in the service of God,” and
he bowed his head and pronounced the
blessing on the copious steak.
In the service of God, Margaret pro-
gressed along the normal line of our
faith. She passed through Sunday
school, Christian Endeavor, Junior
Church to the unquestioning acceptance
of the doctrine of salvation that we
symbolised by baptism in the mid-
teens. Water, water everywhere and all
of it holy. Margaret’s ecstasy at her
own total immersion found expression
in an abstract of wild purples and
rose that formed and re-formed into
layers of concentric circles; but she
showed the painting only to me.
Insulated against self-consciousness
by the communal spirit, she began with
her contemporaries to testify for Christ.
I watched her on the street corner, one
of a tiny band. The little hand organ
palpitated beneath the pounding of Miss
Crossley, cross-eyed with the righteous
pull of her hair straight as the narrow
path from her forehead. The voices
of the young people rose in song. The
texts of the Bible flowed from their
lips in eloquent testimony of their
faith. “For God so loved; let not your
heart be troubled; wine is a mocker.”
Margaret stepped forward. Her hair
hung in uncultivated wisps, coiling
Medusa-like from the plait wound in
the fashion of our faith around her
head. Her stockings, thick, strong, and
durable, were suspended crookedly on
her legs. Her face shone plain and un-
adorned. “Stay me with flagons,” she
cried, “comfort me with apples, for I
am sick of love. His left hand is under
my head and His right hand doth
embrace me.”
Her voice deep, living, halted the
passers-by. They sniggered. The little
group of the faithful was hushed.
“We’re supposed to quote the Bible,”
said her sister at last. “How could you
blaspheme like that?”
Margaret looked at the paler, pret-
tier, younger version of her parents’
desire. She looked at the lips, colored
ever so faintly to create the illusion
of nature that was not natural. “You
are stupid,” Margaret said. “You are
too busy posturing in front of the
mirror to read the wonderful language
of Solomon.”
But her sister may have had a point.
Even I began in. time to feel that Mar-
garet’s testimonies savored somewhat of
the blasphemous. Starved of good
literature by the exigencies of our faith,
the rhetoric of the erotic Bible was at
her fingertips. It was the only sen-
suous language at her disposal and her
frustrated spirit reached for the glory
of words, sensed in the symbolism a
spirituality deeper than any laid before
her by her spiritual pastors.
While the Bible remained her sole
aesthetic inspiration she would ob-
viously continue to embarrass the group
around the hand organ, so, with a few
qualms it is true, I introduced her to
the writings of the Saints and enhanced
them with the paintings of the Byzan-
tine and Medieval Church. Our Church
did not believe in Saints not mentioned
in the New Testament, but I did not
tell Margaret this.
She had only to read them to recog-
nise the spiritual striving essential to
her own being, and, once she had read
them, she became a confirmed addict.
Curled in my armchair she chanted
from The City of God. “It is a great
and admirable thing for one to trans-
cend all creatures corporeal and incor-
poreal, frail and mutable, in His specu-
lation; and to attain to the Deity itself
and learn of that, that it made all things
that are not of the divine essence.”
“Jonesy,” she said. “This is God, His
spirit, His essence.”
Her hand moved, shaping, reshaping.
“If only I could represent it pic-
torially.”
I wonder now, although I did not
wonder then, if I had a desire to cor-
rupt. I had stayed in our Church
partly from habit, partly from con-
venience. It was pleasant to mingle
with my cronies as I had always done,
bowing my head to the chant of the
amens. I received perhaps a masochistic
pleasure from my self-inflicted partici-
pation in their cultural barrenness. Per-
haps I was simply too old to let go,
but there was a sensation not to be
denied in the return from their banal
speech and spiritual asceticism to the
rich sensuality of the greatest writers
and painters. With Margaret I had to
move slowly from meditation to ecstasy,
from ecstasy to rapture, from Christian
to pagan. As I watched her draw the

converts with the language of the de-
spised intellectual I felt a triumph. It
was the twist of the screw to their
overriding self-righteousness.
Like Savonarola she stood among her
contemporaries, robed in the modern
equivalent of sackcloth, plain gingham.
She condemned their hypocrisy, their
creeping into the cinemas after dark,
the faint flush on their lips that preten-
ded not to be paint, their TV-adulter-
ated minds. If her thoughts and images
reflected at times the heathen placidity
of a da Vinci, or the romantic super-
fluity of the pre-Raphaelites rather
than the exaltation of the Saints, she
herself remained innocent.
As she grew, the stultifying atmos-
phere of her own home depressed her.
“Look at them,” she said to me, point-
ing at the texts on her father’s walls,
“neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
things present, nor things to come can
separate us from the love of God, and
how do they express it: purple violets
and silver lettering.” “Could you do
better?” I asked. “Of course.” She
straightened her frock and ran a finger
down her very large, very shiny nose.
“A frieze,” she said, “for my own
room.”
S™ painted the frieze, and apart
from her family, who held a joint
prayer session on the strength of it, I
was one of the few who saw it. Her
representation of sin shaped itself in
the forms of the Cubists. Distorted and
depraved, sensual and damned, evil
twisted around the walls.
Margaret was adamant in the face
of her family’s pleas to erase it and
apparently the Lord was on the side
of the artist, for He sent no fire from
heaven. “Go to the Devil,” she cried
in exasperation to her father, then
halted, dismayed.
Margaret had few intimate friends,
male or female, but she acquired in
the course of time a youth sustained by
little inspiration but much guidance.
He prayed often and read his Bible
regularly. He believed in maxims for
daily living delivered personally by
the Lord via the text. He was limp:
limp hands, limp hair, limp lips, but
his aesthetically starved existence craved
some spark of sensuous excitement. He
found it in Margaret.
“I like him,” she said. Her new
frock was not quite so shapeless. “He’s
negligible,” I replied. A spark of jeal-
ousy pricked through me. I had not
created Margaret for the commonplace.
But the commonplace was hard to
avoid. He was continually at her side,
praying with her at the Town Hall
rallies, thundering with the Christian
Beach Endeavor against the godlessness
of the heathen spreadeagled in sun
worship across the sands of Bondi. I
was getting old. I was powerless.
“We text-hunt together,” she said.
“Cod will guide,” I merely grunted.
From Plato to texts. From Picasso to
silver lettering. It was a regression, but
I knew that the devil of sexual desire
had momentarily beaten me. “God has

spoken,” she said. “Yesterday we
prayed all day for guidance, and our
Bibles opened simultaneously at the
wedding in Cana.”
“God would not be so inartistic,” I
replied, “or perhaps He had Potipher’s
wife ready as His next revelation.” But
the unrecognised urges of the flesh forti-
fied the message of the Lord and she
married him.
Poor Jim. He had no higher ambition
than to preach on Sundays, undertake
a few missions, beget a few children.
Life was to be a paradise of everlasting
sabbaths where they entertained with
good cake and tea the various pastors
and the miscellaneous “saved” of their
faith. Unfortunately for him he had
never seen her bedroom, for our faith
has stern taboos on pre-marital room
visiting.
They began their joint life with
joint prayers, I think Margaret called
it “the communal spirit of the early
Christians;” but his humble questings
could not keep pace with the impas-
sioned but highly referenced monologue
that his wife delivered to God. The
first signs of disruption were minute,
but I noticed them. Within three
months they no longer walked from
church hand in hand, eye glued to
eye. Within a year he sat limply and
alone on my best chair. I could see
the stain of his wet hands spread across
my imported brocade.
“So you’ve been fighting,” I said. He
nodded. “Everyone fights,” I said.
“You’ll get over it.” “It’s not really
the fighting,” he said. “It’s the talk-
ing.” “What do you mean?” For a
second he was almost positive. “I barely
get a word in,” he shouted. “She does
all the talking, all of it, all of the time.”
“She was always a fine talker,” I said.
He wiped his forehead. The vehem-
ence dissipated. “Am I boring?” I
avoided' the answer with a question.
“Why do you ask?” “She says anyone
of supreme intelligence such as God
would have ceased to listen to me long
ago.” “Go on,” I said. “She she
said ‘the Lord has been beset by hack-
neyed phrases and slipshod English
Sunday after Sunday for a couple of
millenniums without me adding my
quota.’ ” He looked at me, moist-eyed,
pleading. The sweat dripped from
his fingers. “Mr. Jones, I’m not very
bright, but I was taught that the Lord
does hear the humble supplicant.” I
patted his shoulder. “True, son, true,”
I said. “Just keep it up. Particularly
the humility. Your future is in the
Lord’s hands.”
I watched his damp back recede
down my drive. I smiled. I felt jubilant.
In her turn, Margaret walked up and
down my room. Her hands waved in
emphatic impatience over my most
precious possessions. I stirred uneasily.
“He’s unbearable,” she said. “He’s
your husband,” I answered. I felt smug.
“I know,” she said, “I know. There’s
no need to rub it in. That doesn’t
help me to stand his insidious humility.”

piece of Venetian glass. It’s rare.” She
picked it up. For a second her eyes
glowed. “It’s lovely, truly lovely.” The
glow faded. She continued to prowl.

Writ and damn St. Paul. They were
fools.” “The saints?” I queried. “Yes,”
she shouted, “the Saints, the whole
sanctimonious pack of them.”
There was silence. Her hand fondled
a delicately carved ivory elephant. Her
eyes met mine. She looked away. “I
must be going.” At the door she looked
back. “I fear,” she said, “I have come
too far.” “As long as it is in the direc-
tion you want,” I replied, “I cannot see
that it matters.” She walked away. In-
side, I took down my Odyssey. I have
always enjoyed the story of Circe, pro-
vided it is followed by a story like
Leda.
All I needed now was patience.
Occasionally, I dropped in to see them
just for the pleasure of it. On the
material side Jim’s life was undoubtedly
hell. Their house was a shambles. He
could not have known, poor boy, that
her lack of personal adornment had
never been basically spiritual but pure
lack of interest. The everyday duties
of life passed by her unheeded. She
had no concern for housekeeping. As the
joys of marriage declined, her contempt
for washing floors, scouring dishes,
ironing clothes increased. By 7 a.m.
each day his clothes, etc., had dis-
appeared under a clutter of odds and
ends. He raved and ranted but she
ignored him. He was permanently late
for work. They fought now openly,
bitterly, even in front of me. “You
are a slattern,” he said, as she sat, head
bowed, sketching. “You are a materia-
list, an illiterate,” she answered, not
even bothering to raise her head.
Finally she decided to paint a mural.
She looked with intensity at the lounge-
room wall, a blank wasted space. She
hated artistic waste. “The Bible story,”
she said. I looked at Jim. His face was
enthusiastic. He had a vision of a few
little glorified texts. I merely shrugged.
she began to shut herself
away week after week, his doubts
grew. He sat in my lounge chair biting
his nails. “She won’t let me see it.” His
voice was a whimper. “I’ve got to
stop her, Jonesy, I’ve got to stop her
...” I shook my head. I knew it was
no longer in his or my power to stay
the wave of creative talent that was
at last set free.
For a long time I saw neither of
them, then I heard from a friend that
he was back with his mother. Next
Sunday he was in church, neat, well-
cleaned, shaven, and limp. He lurked
in the shadow of his mother’s broad,
comforting but completely mundane
frame. Margaret was not present.
I went to the house. The door was
open, so I walked in. Then I stopped,
breathless with the glory of it. All the
energy that in another time, another
place, another sex might have produced
a great late Medieval painter glowed
from the wall opposite me. There
in towering forms and crude shapes
was depicted the emergence of man
from the will of God a double-
bodied God, one aspect a virile, naked
man, the other a woman on the point
of giving birth.
“Margaret,” I cried, “Margaret.” I
went into her bedroom. She stood on
a ladder, brush in hand. Her eyes were
no longer sane. In front of me was
a new inferno, but the devils were
limp, mundane; and in the centre, like
a huge spider gorging on the body of
the artist, was an old man wreathed in
imported brocade, Venetian glass, and
the heathen classics.

A Critic for the World
By VIVIAN SMITH
Conspirators and Poets. D. J. Enright.
C-hatto and Windus. $4.25.
D. J. ENRIGHT is one of the most
cosmopolitan of modern poets.
Egypt, Germany, Siam, Singapore,
England are some of the countries that
feature in his pointed poems on the
eternal varieties of life in the present.
He is an equally cosmopolitan critic,
and in his new collection of essays he
moves through English, French, Ger-
man, Italian, and English-Malay liter-
ature with the skill of an expert, taking
in Greek, Persian, and Indian trans-
lations on the way.
Enright’s range is. uncom-
monly wide. What is more, his
cosmopolitanism is not that
of the study but that of a
man who knows well the
countries, people, and things
written about. Cavafy, Gun-
ter Grass, Svevo, Monther-
lant, Thomas Mann: Enright
seems to have come to these
writers as much through a
knowledge of their countries
or fellow countrymen as
through a love of literature
itself. He has not merely read
their work: he knows it thoroughly.
He has the scholar’s memory for the
particular line or passage that sends
the quick theorist tumbling. He isn’t
the kind of scholar-critic who runs in
with the big quote from Coleridge or
Goethe to do all his work for him,
but he offers something more than
routine opinion.
“Conspirators and Poets” is a selec-
tion of reviews and articles published
over the past five years or so and they
fall naturally into four or five different
groups. There are the obligatory essays
on the critics. Enright is particularly
sensible about “The Rise of the Critico-
cracy” and he repeats here what he has
always stressed, especially in “The
Apothecary’s Shop,” that “Criticism is
and must remain the handmaiden of
literature.” There is a generous defence
of “Scrutiny” by one of the Founder’s
students, enlivened incidentally by its
awareness of the mistakes perpetrated
by the Leavisite epigoni, and, to bal-
ance it, a penetrating study of Cyril
Connolly, the Czar of the “Sunday
Times.”
Among the essays on English writers,
those on the writers of World War
I form a special group and perhaps
arose marginally out of the reading for
the study of “The Literature of the
First World War” Enright contributed
to “The Modem Age.” They include
studies of Rupert Brooke, Wilfred
Owen, Herbert Read, D. H. Lawrence
(the poetry), and Robert Graves. No
D. J. Enright
one is likely to dissent at this stage
from his view that:
“Brooke’s achievement in poetry
is slight: he was a graceful writer of
light verse, and his light verses are
few. As for his life, it is rather as if
his Shelleyan appearance obliged him
to strive to be all the things he wasn’t
by nature. To be a bohemian, a rebel,
a socialist, a ladies’ man, even per-
haps a poet, when in his heart of
hearts he was really a scoutmaster, a
housemaster, a Justice of the Peace.”
He pays tribute to Herbert Read’s
undeniable qualities: “the sentiments
are warm, at times (some
might contend) overheated,
yet there is a certain abstract-
ness, a coldness in their ex-
pression. The ultimate cold-
ness of the aesthete, perhaps?”
There is, of course, no sub-
stitute for intelligence in
criticism, and Enright is an
admirably intelligent critic.
Opinion becomes knowledge
throughout; perception prin-
ciple. And he writes with a
vigor and a lightness merci-
fully free of shrill or timid
qualifications or emphases. All is im-
plicit in the quality of the observations
themselves. Even when he attacks, as
in the essays on Lawrance Durrell, who
is nevertheless praised for certain
qualities and not just given a benevo-
lently patronising pat on the head; or
in the incisive slashing of John Updike,
“the laureate of the second-hand auto-
mobile,” who is so frequently praised
for his “tragic awareness of the domes-
tic terrors,” the tribute to the author
is there in the quality of the attention
brought to bear on his work.
Enright is no aesthete, and his fear
of the aesthetic is the one over-insistent
note in his work; but only a critic
capable of the deepest aesthetic res-
ponses could write as richly as he does
about Robert Graves, Philip Larkin,
Cavafy, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
Enright is not an abstract theorist,
either, and he steers clear of the wide
philosophical gestures. He sticks to the
text and to his own experience. His
judgments and findings are all the more
penetrating for being so fully personal:
I noticed only one slight inconsistency
in his book. He seems to criticise Hof-
mannsthal for some of the reasons he
praises Robert Graves.
Of Eric Heller’s study of Thomas
Mann Enright says: “The individual
successes are too many to recount.” One
could apply the statement to his own
book. Here, however, are a few of the
individual successes:
On Art:
“Art is not good manners and
proper behaviour: to obtain art you
cannot use the same methods of dis-
cipline and control by which you en-
courage these social amenities. To
obtain art, to build up a culture, you
must leave people free to make their
own mistakes, to suffer and discover,
to come to terms with the foul rag-
and-bone shop of their own hearts
and whatever else, less foul, more
fair, their own hearts may contain or
be capable of. It is an old-fashioned
view, but I persist in thinking that
the greater part of a people’s culture
lies in the art which those people
produce and consume.”
Of literary movements:
“They are born and die —they must
die if literature is to go on. No move-
ment, no style can be kept artificially
alive: it can only be preserved as
pastiche.”
Of C. P. Snow:
“His prose sometimes reminds one
of orthodox Soviet writing: solemn,
shrewdly simple, bucolically genial,
heavily tolerant of minor sins, so
ponderous in its humor as to be
humorless —and apt to excite acute
suspicion and alarm in the not-utterly-
credulous.”
Of criticism:
“The critic simplifies, the critic of
the critic simplifies further.”
Out of Deep Waters
By MANNING CLARK
The Seven Rivers. Douglas Stewart.
Angus and Robertson. $3.75.
OF writing many books, we have
been told on high authority, there
is no end, and much study is a
weariness of the flesh. Yet for a chosen
few the writing of books does lay up
for their authors treasures, if not on
earth, or in heaven, then in their own
hearts. Douglas Stewart is one of the
writers who has acquired that sort of
stature in that flowering time of our
literature since the beginning of World
War 11.
Many are the outward and visible
signs of his achievement. To mention a
minor one, those who receive some
subterranean satisfaction from savaging
their fellow writers of stature singled
him out for attack. But the measure
of his achievement is not so much the
quality of his writing, or its message (if
indeed he or any writer of stature ever
had a message), but rather that the
words he put into the mouth of Scott
in “The Fire Qn The Snow” or the


Douglas Stewart
words of Ned and
Joe Byron in
“Ned Kelly” have
become part of
the intellectual
climate in Aus-
tralia, just as cool
changes are part
of another sort of
climate in Mel-
bourne, and call-
ing President
Johnson “that
b cowboy” is
part of our climate of humor.
How any man acquires such a
stature for his generation rriust remain
a mystery. - Some light, perhaps, is
thrown on the source of the mystery
in this book on fishing, if only because
here he uncovers some of the things
which have touched him deeply as a
man. Everyone who has read his two
major verse plays “The Fire On
The Snow” and “Ned Kelly” and
the numbers by now must be in the
hundreds of thousands, because Stew-
art was always groping toward that
gift of the prophet, the one who speaks
for his generation everyone must
have noticed that feeling for the deli-
cate things in this world, for flowers,
for butterflies, and in crystals lived in
him side by side with a fascination
with and a recoil from violence.
So here in a book of essays on fish-
ing, which tell so felicitously the whole
story of his fishing expeditions from
the days of the bent pin in childhood
to the days when he and that lovable
giant of a man, David Campbell,
swopped ideas on all things under the
sun from the best fly to catch a rain-
bow to good talk about other poets.
There is a good deal of boisterous
humor, as one would expect from the
man with an eye for the horseplay of
the members of the Kelly gang.
Yet underneath the still waters,
underneath the love of good tucker,
something else is going on in the book.
In point of time and place the book
moves from boyhood days in the New
Zealand rivers to the adult days
down Kosciusko way. There is more
to it, though, than just the movement
from one set of mountain streams to
another.
Fishing, in some ways, is a coming
to terms with what for Douglas Stewart
seems to be the truth about the human
situation that just as that white
curve is for ever out of reach for most
men, so is the object of the quest in
fishing that monster which feeds in
the deep waters quite indifferent to all
a man can offer, no matter how irresist-
ible, or varied, or ingenious. Life should
be lived hard and heroic, even though
it is absurd, and all men are players
in a vaudeville of devils. Men may
judge each other harshly, behave abom-
inably to each other, do such evil to
each other that no man, or god, could
expiate or atone for their crimes, but
life is, paradoxically, supremely worth
while.
Hardy Perennial
By GEOFFREY SCOTT

and Terry Coleman. Hutchinson. $5.90.
Thomas Hardy: The Will and the Way.
Roy Morell. Oxford University Press.
$6.40.
WHEN Edmund Gosse wrote his
review of “Jude the Obscure” in
1896 he asked: “What has
Providence done to Mr. Hardy that he
should rise up in the arable land of
Wessex and shake his fist at his
Creator?” Other critics have begged
the same question—that Hardy’s sombre
view of life was perhaps based, at least
partly, on some painful personal ex-
perience. Hitherto there has been hardly
a scrap of fact to support this theory,
though Hardy was a close and secretive
man in biographical matters. Inter-
viewers who called at Max Gate got
short shrift, and Hardy often bitterly
denounced critics who professed to see
in his novels the events and characters
of his own life.
Now, however, in “Providence and
Mr. Hardy,” Lois Deacon and Terry
Coleman provide what they suggest may
be an answer to Gosse’s question. In
brief, they offer evidence of an early
love affair between Thomas Hardy and
a young Dorset neighbor, Tryphena
Sparks, which ended when Tryphena
married someone else after giving birth
to Hardy’s illegitimate child. Further
they suggest that the romance was
broken off because Hardy discovered
that his mistress was not his cousin, as
he had supposed, but his niece and
marriage between uncle and niece came
within the prohibited degrees of the
Church of England.
The story of the discovery, if it is a
discovery, is a curious one. While visit-
ing Germany in 1959 Lois Deacon met
a Mrs. Eleanor Bowden, who, in the
course of talks about Hardy’s books,
volunteered the information that her
grandmother had once been engaged
to young Thomas Hardy at the time
when he was just beginning his lit-
erary career. Miss Deacon, an amateur
specialist in Hardy, had never heard of
Tryphena Sparks, nor could she find
any reference to her in material about
Hardy, published or unpublished. In
the spirit of A. J. A. Symons seeking
the elusive Baron Corvo, Miss Deacon
enlisted the aid of Terry Coleman, a
Fleet Street journalist, and set out to
track down Tryphena Sparks.
Her chief source of information
(indeed the only source, apart from
cryptic references in Hardy’s own poems
and novels) was Mrs. Eleanor Bromell,
Mrs. Bowden’s mother and Tryphena’s
daughter by her marriage with Charles
Gale. Mrs. Bromell was 80 years old
when the authors began bombarding
her with questions about the long-
forgotten romance between Hardy and
her mother. Since Tryphena died
quite young, most of Mrs. Bromell’s
recollections were based on what her
father told her about Tom Hardy and
the girl who later became his wife.
An imposing edifice of speculation (“no
doubt . . “it seems likely that . . .”
etc.) is raised on this rather flimsy
foundation. Still, most of it is reason-
able and illuminating enough, granted
the basic premise. It is when the
authors come to Hardy’s bastard child
that scepticism raises its snakelike head.
Mrs. Bromell was 86, and a month
away from the grave, when she first
identified the photograph of a small
boy in Tryphena’s album as “Tom
Hardy’s son.” By then, according to
the authors, “although for half the
time she was her old self, acute of
hearing and understanding, for the
other half of the time she was confused
and wandered in her thoughts.” A
faded photograph, the memory of a
very old woman, a handful of obscure
literary allusions —it is not much to go
on. Until more facts come to light the
true story of the love affair between
Thomas Hardy and Tryphena Sparks
must remain a tantalising mystery.
JN any case, I doubt very much
whether it was this frustrating experi-
ence that caused Hardy to brandish a
fist at his Creator. The authors see re-
flections of Tryphena everywhere in
the novels; in Sue Bridehead (Try-
phena was a schoolmistress and one of
the “new women”), in Tess and Eus-
tacia Vye (Tryphena was a passionate
lover), and in many another of Hardy’s
ill-fated heroines. In some cases the
parallels are strained to breaking point.
The “Wessex Poems” provide more
useful clues. In them are many echoes
of old, uneasily remembered bitternesses
that can certainly be best explained
by a young man’s romantic dreams. But
to claim that this experience was the
seed from which Hardy’s mature philo-
sophy—that great spreading tree of
pantheistic pessimism—germinated is to
do much less than justice to a very
complex man. In fairness to the
authors it should be said that they do
not make this claim, at least not
explicitly.
Professor Morell is also concerned
with shedding fresh light on Hardy’s
character and beliefs. “Thomas Hardy”
is not a biography but a closely docu-
mented and doggedly argued thesis de-
signed to show that Hardy was not the
mere fatalist and determinist he is often
held up to be. It is a book for the
student and specialist, rugged going for
the general reader, and I think that
many simple Hardy-lovers, like myself,
will be more bemused than enlightened
by this massive drumfire of facts and
allusions.

Bernard Fall’s Vietnam
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
Vietnam Witness. Bernard Fall. Praeger.
$7.80.
ALL students of modern Vietnam
are in Mr. Bernard Fall’s debt.
A former French maquisard and
officer in French Indo-China, he has
for years as an American citizen
devoted himself to gathering material
on a grand scale about Vietnam. Out
of these endeavors has emerged the
quite invaluable “Street Without Joy,”
“The Two Vietnams,” and “Le Viet
Minh 1945-60.”
The present book is an edited collec-
tion of his occasional writings on Viet-
nam; and this, too, is an indispensable
addition to the literature of revolution-
ary warfare and Vietnamese politics.
Probably no one in the world, individu-
ally, has a filing card system on Viet-
nam approaching Mr. Fall’s; few people
in the West can possibly claim to have
devoted more attention to the recent
problems of that country.
Nevertheless, it is impossible for the
reviewer to set aside certain serious
misgivings about Mr. Fall’s extra-
ordinary confidence, while applauding
the stated intention of his writings: “If
anything, this volume is less a plea and
an example of the right to dissent—for
dissent, too, has its ‘organisation men’
than for the right to think inde-
pendently and to have one’s thoughts
accepted and seriously weighed.” A
citizen of a liberal capitalist country
who really aspires to think independ-
ently, as Mr. Fall undoubtedly has
done, builds his confidence on sand if
he imagines that the bureaucrats
whose existence depends upon the
claim to a superior knowledge will,
at the same time, weigh his words
policy-wise.
JJOWEVER, the matter is not as
simple as that. His publishers
claim and one feels that Mr. Fall
would all too quickly agree that he
has been “consistently right” over the
years. It would be more correct to say
that Mr. Fall has seldom been obviously
wrong; but this for reasons of style
rather than near-omniscience. All too
often his manner of discussing a prob-
lem is so cagy sometimes to the
point of contradictoriness . that one
is constrained to wonder what he has
been right about. This is in no sense
the result of political or personal or
national bias; but rather the result of
a seemingly desperate concern never
to be wrong.
If, for example, one compares Mr.
Fall’s assessment of the nature of the
Viet Cong and its relations with Hanoi
in “The Two Vietnams” with the
assessment made here toward the end
of the book, one quickly perceives evi-
dence of a considerable volte-face (if
one may use such a positive description
of Mr. Fall’s mode of analysis), which
is sometimes acknowledged but never
adequately explained in the footnotes.
The same thing is to be found, though
much less obviously, within “Vietnam
Witness.”
In “The Two Vietnams,” his ver-
sion of the nature of the struggle in
South Vietnam, and the organisation
involved in the insurgency, is quite con-
sistent with the general consensus of in-
formed non-Communist opinion. There,
Mr. Falls establishes in considerable de-
tail that “In terms of its political-
administrative apparatus, the South
Vietnamese insurgency operated until
December, 1960, as simply an extension
of the then-existing Communist under-
ground apparatus.” Having written
that, he half accepts the still wholly
unproven thesis of M. Philippe Devil-
lers (a scholar for whom I have a high
regard) to the effect that the 1957-
onwards rising was originally popular
and non-Communist; but he adds that
the Hanoi regime took oyer this popu-
lar insurrection.
This kind of heaping of half-state-
ment upon half-statement in order to
build a kind of intellectual humus over
the years a humus out of which
sturdy, mushrooms of expertise rather
than flowers of bright relevance emerge
—can become intensely irritating to
readers not wholly unconversant with
Vietnamese politics yet vividly aware
of errors they have perpetrated them-
selves.
In “Vietnam Witness,” Mr. Fall
writes in 1958 before most Western-
ers were aware that Diem’s “show case”
was about to be burst wide open by
revolutionary warfare that “there
must be some co-ordination between
the rebels and the North Vietnamese
Government” (his original assessment,
later shaken by one must assume
M. Devillers’ Gallic logic, scarcely by
his lack of evidence). In 1965, Mr. Fall
writes: “The present situation is not
entirely due to North Vietnamese ag-
gressiveness; nor can the blame be laid
fully at the feet of the oppressive and
woefully inefficient Ngo Dinh Diem
regime. The truth, as almost always in
such cases, lies somewhere in between.”
In 1966, “Still, the National Libera-
tion Front of South Vietnam is a fact
for all its outside Communist sup-
port, technical advice, and even direc-
tion.”
Now, of course, there are nuances
in every great struggle and in the ori-
gins thereof. They are the very proper
concern of historians, they are part- of
the modern self-awareness of free com-
munities. To recognise nuances is to
recognise limits on permissible be-
haviour, which is civilisation itself. Of
course, it is true that there are “elements
of civil war” in the South Vietnamese
agony today (the quotation is from Mr.
Dean Rusk, used by Mr. Fall); of
course, there are men in the NLF who
see themselves as southern maquisards
fighting against southern regimes they
believe to havq been unjust; of course
dreadful mistakes were made, and some-
times (though not nearly as often as is
today suggested) dreadful things done
by the Diem regime. There are so many
“of courses” of this kind.
B UT policy decisions can not be
based upon nuances. As Hanson
Baldwin has put it, “Compromise and
consensus perhaps applicable to some
of the nation’s great domestic problems
—can not be guideposts to foreign
policy. There must be clear-cut and
courageous decision.” Policy-makers
must be prepared to be proved wrong
in the event. (The American system of
Government is immensely more honest
than the Australian in this regard; there,
the real policy-makers, politicians, and
civil servants have to pay a price if
their policies are proved wrong.) Mr.
Fall is manifestly unwilling ever to ad-
mit to serious error —and, as has been
suggested, it would be difficult to attri-
bute specific errors to him for reasons
of style, though it is worth recalling the
importance he once placed on attacking
the “privileged sanctuary” of a revolu-
tionary warfare movement.
However, Mr. Fall is superb where
an independently thinking intellectual
should be superb; in authoritatively
underlining serious errors within a gen-
eral policy, most notably and most
beautifully in his insistence upon the
obligation of the U.S.A. and its allies
to observe the Geneva Convention in
South Vietnam. It is the duty of every
intellectual to try to assert before the

policy-makers the necessity of a cer-
tain modesty of aim and objective. As
a great Frenchman, Raymond Aron
(the Camus of sociology), has tried to
impress upon us, the intellectual who
calls himself “faithful to the essential
values,” yet chooses the Communist
camp, “suffers a perversion of the
moral sense.” Yet, Aron again, the
West must not ever wish the physical
destruction of Communist States, only
the death of their ideology.
In war, the two things can easily
be confused; it is the lonely privilege
and honor of men like Fall to remind
the policy-makers of this. They can
claim no more; nor do more. Mr. Fall
is wholly aware of the vitally important
“denial value” of South East Asia; at
this time of war, it can only be hoped
that he will continue to insist upon cer-
tain basic restraints. In doing this he,
with his great authority, will do far,
far more than he could ever achieve if
he were to fall into the trap of be-
lieving that he should necessarily be
heeded policy-wise in Washington
in 1966.
Trad. Lefties and Sceptics
By PETER SAMUEL
Labor in Vain? D. W. Rawson. Long-
mans. $2.75.
THIS is a truly astonishing book.
There’s something in it for every-
one. For the professional anti-
Communist there in great big initials
is the warning that “International
Communism” poses a threat to Aus-
tralian society. For the professional
anti-anti-Communist there is the
delightfully contemptuous rubbishing of
the “Groupers” as having “bothered”
the ALP from time to time, as well
as abuse like the adjective “paranoiac”
and the statement that they are “weird
protagonists” living in fantasy worlds.
On the question of Socialism and the
ALP there are views which will, in
isolation, satisfy several different camps.
The sceptic is assured that “Socialism”
means all things to all men, that it
has been a war-cry or incantation, an
inspiration, a red-herring, a shibboleth,
a means of expressing hostility and
alienation and never description of a
state of society or a program for
action. It is therefore an illusion.
But, happily, elsewhere in the book,
the illusion is concretised so that the
Left-wing reader is not left unsatisfied.
There is then a changeover point in
the argument, as Rawson-the-sceptic be-
comes Rawson-the-trad-Leftie. It turns
on the proposition that there is “some-
thing” in the ALP’s Socialism but it
is “infuriatingly difficult to define
clearly.” Having been overcome by fury
there follow some magnificent dashes
of Marxist determinism. We live in a
world which, in the long run, is moving
toward Socialism (undefined).
Capitalism is on the decline, and
Labor can become a “real Socialist
Party,” whatever that might be. But
in this realm of infuriatingly difficult
definitions there are warnings which
the Liberal can cheer. Rawson tells
his readers that under Socialism there
is no evidence that trade unions can
survive. And there are problems in
reconciling freedom with Socialism.
Labor’s foreign policy record is vex-
ing, and Rawson obliges people of sev-
eral political stances by offering each
some reassurance for their viewpoint.
It has been marked by “the most
obvious and vulgar parochialism, afid
and ill-informed suspiciousness, bloody-
minded racialism, murky and dangerous
bombast, and most commonly of all
by sheer neglect and apathy.” He
speaks also of an aversion to military
preparedness, and hostility to inter-
national commitments. But Inter-
national Communism is a- threat, and
the virtues of the Labor tradition can
only be effective where there is no
real external challenge or where they
are combined, if this is possible, with
some effective military strength. But
this is Menzies-Rawson, or Beazley-
Rawson.
There is a Labor-Public-Relations-
Rawson, too, who speaks of the basically
sound record of the ALP in foreign
affairs, the virtuous traditions of eclec-
ticism, self-reliance and enlightened self-
interest. Anyway, there has been no
real competition from non-Labor, whose
record has been worse, and who have
been plagued by the forces of history.
Then there is the Marxist assurance
that “Non-Labor foreign policies have
involved and continue to involve back-
ing forces which in the end must de-
cline.” That Socialism business will
out, sometime eventually. Non-Labor
might as well give up.
There can be no two ways about
it. This “essay” is a dreadful mess of
contradictions, undefined concepts and
conflicting social theories. There is
the occasional fact wrong, too the
claim, for instance, that Victoria has
always been electorally weak for Labor.
(See B. O. Jones in the January issue
of “Partisan” for a telling refutation
of that old piece of Victorian Central
Executive mythology.)
But the other thing about the book
is that despite the nonsense so far
described there is a lot of sense in
the book, too. There is competent
discussion of the Labor Party machine,
and a bright chapter on the place of
politicians, including a convincing'
defence of the principle of party
control. Finally, there is a well-argued
attack on the familiar prophecies of
doom about the future of the ALP.
For journalists there are quotable quotes^
Lilt
Making the slow line dip and sway in its motion,
Proceeding gravely into and out of the limelight
Is worth the endeavor, if you are given to word-games,
Which all of us are in one way or another,
Playing at words of love and the language of dying,
What we say being just as green as the world is.

What to Do Next
THE Government seems to be relying far too heavily on
recovery in the rural sector to provide a general eco-
nomic stimulus. The trouble is that, after a drought as
severe as last year’s, farmers are likely to lead two or three
pretty thrifty years. They won’t be throwing money around
in time to boost spending significantly for some time. A little
boost Budget or a downward adjustment in interest rates
should be among the first matters to be considered by the
new Government.
Last week’s crop of statistics was of course interpreted
by Government spokesmen as evidence of the excellent
state of the economy. Mr. Bury said that the October
employment figures showed that “the trend to an increasing
demand for labor evident in the last few months intensified.”
Forgoing comment on the Minister’s grammar, we can say
unequivocally that as a piece of economic analysis this is
misleading bunk. The falls in unemployment are purely
seasonal. They happen every year as factories and shops
take on extra staff for the busy pre-Christmas period and
as harvesting begins in the country. Every year since 1788
there has been a similar phenomenon, even if the Depart-
ment of Labor and National Service was not around to
collect the statistics which measure it.
Abstracting from seasonality, the picture continues to be
rather grey, if not black. The economy continues to slide
to slightly lower levels of activity and the margin of unused
resources to increase. This sort of draft does not threaten
any imminent recession, but it does threaten a continuation
of the present listless economic condition.
The month saw motor vehicle sales weaken again slightly
to a rate hardly more than 350,000 for the year. This is a
great disappointment, as it was thought that Ford’s new
cars might provide some sustained stimulus to the overall
market. These poor sales are having their impact on capital
spending by industry. Another release showed that in the
September quarter the motor industry spent only $9.4 million
on new plant compared with $23.6 million and $21.8 mil-
lion in the corresponding quarters of the previous two years.
Overall capital spending by business is only being held
from a substantial collapse by burgeoning investment in
extracting, refining, founding, and chemicals. Unfortunately
much of this money is going on inefficent plants molly-
coddled by extraordinarily high tariffs.
The Ties that Bind
NOT even the Federal elections have been able to stir
up much public enthusiasm, so the chances of such an
ephemeral topic as the renewed possibility of Britain
joining the Common Market doing so have naturally not
been bright. But it is striking not only that Britain’s eager-
ness once again to try to end the trading ties that so loosely
bind the Commonwealth has aroused such little discussion
here, but more so that the discussion that has taken place
has been on political rather than trade terms.
Last week’s House of Commons debate on Britain and
Europe prompted only two newspaper editorials here. One
stressed that the price of Britain’s entry into the EEC would
be too high if it meant abandoning her American alliance
or her world role (particularly east of Suez, where she has
some very real defence commitments). The other said that
Britain must enter the EEC (“with Australia’s blessing”)
to act as a political counterweight to Germany, whose sheer

The reason he lost with Farley and
Lewers (he has been left with about
20 percent of its capital—but there still

that the board of Farleys opposed him;
with F. W. Williams, at least he has

industrial and productive might must otherwise lead to its
taking on a dominant political position in the community.
All this seems to dramatise that Australians no longer
consider the special trading relations we have with Britain
are an issue worth getting excited about; that these are not
a major factor in the negotiations, even though Britain
takes about 20 percent of our exports. This may well be the
realistic view; if so we should proceed to increase the rapid
rate of trade diversification that has gone on since the last
round of EEC negotiations ended so abruptly in 1962. In
any event, there are many who consider that last time,
when agricultural problems attracted such a great deal of
the negotiating limelight, it was not Commonwealth imports
that provided the greatest stumbling block so much as the
problems of Britain’s own agricultural producers.
Fixed Deposit Rates
SINCE the official cut of one-quarter percent in the
interest rate on fixed-term bank deposits in August,
only a modicum of additional money has gone into
them compared with the strong flow in the past few years
when bank interest rates were biased in their direction.
Practically all the high seasonal increase in bank deposits
this year has gone into current deposits, which, in October,
rose $92.4 million compared with a mere $3B million
increase in fixed deposits (in the previous month the increase
in fixed deposits was even less).
Fixed deposits have certainly proved ultra-sensitive to a
marginal downward change in interest rates on them this
year, just as they have been highly responsive to the official
bias in interest rates in their favor in the past few years.
As an exercise in monetary policy, the Commercial Bank
of Australia, in its centennial Economic Review, considers
this response well justifies the continuing use of differential
rates as a weapon of monetary policy, even if, as it thinks,
the effect on the velocity of circulation has been only
marginal.
The CBA agrees that the August cut was made at a
time when some reassessment of the bias was necessary,
but it seems to go too far in saying the cut had no
monetary policy implications. A clear effect would seem to
be that, through the diversion of funds into current deposits,
it has strengthened the lending capacity of the trading
banks, and this has been showing up in a more than seasonal
increase in advances. The latter seems to have been in
the mind of the monetary authorities in making the August
reduction in fixed deposit rates.
Salvaging at Cox Bros.
DEBENTURE holders in Cox Bros, should take heart
from the success of the liquidators of Reid Murray
in salvaging three-quarters or more of the debenture
money in that group from what, when the receivers moved
in, looked a more hopeless wreck than proved to be the
case. Perhaps the RM liquidators were exceptionally astute
in the wav they nurtured some of the big assets, such as
Robert Reid, the group’s warehousing subsidiary, and sold
them off at very good prices as going concerns. The same
could happen with Cox Bros., and probably will.
Although he doesn’t seem all that confident that Cox
Bros, debenture holders will get more than 45 to 50 percent
of their money back, the trustee, if he takes his time about
it, as the liquidators of RM did, and gets the best people
available, should be able to ripen quite a number of pippens
for eventual sale as going concerns. A number of vultures
are waiting for cheap pickings.
As the exercise in unscrambling the group proceeds, the
more of a nightmare the Cox Bros, debacle is becoming for
Cox Finance and Australian United Corporation, which has
a fifty percent interest in it. It is hardly likely the recovery
of funds will ever be on a sufficient scale to give unsecured
creditors anything. A report from the receiver last week left
little doubt that Cox Finance is the biggest unsecured credi-
tor of the group. Its eventual write-off could well be
$1,000,000 or more.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: In releasing the end-October
employment figures, Mr. Bury hazarded that “the trend
to an increasing demand for labor evident in the last
few months intensified.” Actual unemployed registrants
totalled 48,571 (one percent of the work force and
down 2345 on the month), while registered vacancies
reached 50,768 (up 9545). Seasonally adjusted, the pic-
ture doesn’t look quite so attractive.
Industry’s new capital spending fell back by $37.1
million to $424.5 million during the September quarter
. . . The September month saw hire-purchase outstand-
ings rise by $5.4 million to a record $1887.1 million,
although the advance is ascribed to lower collections
and not to more lending; credit for retail sales gained
only a little . . . October’s motor sales dropped from
31,758 to 31,415, representing an annual rate of 356,000
against 1965’s 407,000 and 1964’s 409,000.
Trading bank advances touched a peak $2915.2 mil-
lion in October, $237 million above October, 1965; on
the same comparison, deposits added $347.2 million to
reach $5125.4 million . . . Australia’s overseas reserves
made a small gain of $3.6 million to $1289.8 million
in October.
For the four months to October the wool cheque, at
$208.6 million, was $15.2 million better than for the
corresponding 1965 period.
L ■
For the markets: Once more Australian share
markets put a brighter face on Friday trading, yet they
were still down on the week. Volumes have been dis-
tinctly tepid, with some kick, however, coming toward
the close. Leaders look uneven, and second-line dealings
are particularly selective.
Better external trade in October and Common Mar-
ket hopes furnished some stimulus in London, largely
cancelled by a decline in production and a higher cost
of living; buyers remain timid . . . Reduced housing
starts and slow car sales tend to keep Wall Street
bearish.
FOr companies : The English merchant banker
Ralli Bros, has irrevocably withdrawn its partial take-
over and reorganisation proposal for retailer Cox Bros.
(Australia); the receiver may now attempt to sell assets
to benefit debenture holders, “as a going concern if pos-
sible,” but finds it hard to estimate the real value of
listed debentures . . . Textiler Bond’s Industries is
holding takeover talks with Melbourne towel maker and
cotton spinner H. B. Dickie, and already owns 12.7 per-
cent of the ordinary capital ... A second unnamed
bidder for Reinvestment Aust. will not proceed; directors
still spurn Hothlyn Securities . . . E. Z. Industries gives
notice of terminating its freight contract with Emu Bay
Railway on rejection of the takeover; the bid, however,
goes direct to shareholders.
Some motor dealers find it very tough . . . Sydney
Holden distributor John A. Gilbert earned much less
in its first half, so cut interim payment from 1\ to 5
percent, thus confirming a 10 percent annual rate . . .
Larke Consolidated started with a “disappointing” first
quarter, yet directors anticipate a “considerably better”
second half . . . Early buoyancy was absent for National
Consolidated, which, however, expects an upward trend
soon . . . Melbourne’s Motor Spares slipped from
$203,896 to $150,188 in the June year, bringing dividend
from 10 to 8 percent.
Heavy engineering and electrical appliances suffered
in the hands of A. G. Healing, who lost $1,122,254,
passed entirely a previously reduced dividend, and
appears to be emerging from most of the troubles . . .
Civil engineer McDonald Industries hit profits again,
earning $261,151 after 1964-65’s $338,386 loss; some
joint contracts have been advantageously renegotiated.

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Loud and Ringing Sounds
LIKE Goldwater in his 1964 cam-
paign against Johnson, Mr. Cal-
well has chosen to make his
assault all along the front. He has
thrown in everything he can lay his
hands on. In doing this he has so
escalated the level of political conflict
that all the subtlety of debate is
drowned out by the noise of full-scale
ideological warfare. Mr. Calwell offers
and calls for, not adjustments or inno-
vations, but sweeping simple solutions,
with loud ringing sounds about them.
Foreign investment, therefore, is to
be subjected to regulation and control.
Just how or which or according to
what criteria these controls would be
exercised is nowhere explained. Not
even the objective is outlined.
A national fuel policy again sounds
so grand, but what on earth does it
mean? Does it mean protecting exist-
ing fuel industries from the competi-
tion of newer, cheaper sources of power,
or price fixing, or production controls,
or nationwide fuel and power authori-
ties, or what? Does it mean anything?
And then what is to be made of
controls over prices, especially when
these are to be exercised without a
bureaucracy or wholesale rationing.
In today’s highly decentralised, diverse
economy it is impossible to see how
such controls could operate.
*J»HE claim that price control would
be exercised so as to avoid ration-
ing can only mean that it would be
ineffective. By definition, a price lower
than a market price will lead to buyers
wanting greater quantities than sellers
are willing to sell. Someone, either
sellers or Government officials, will
have to decide who goes short, and this
decision will be an act of rationing.
And then there is this control over
interest rates, which the Opposition
promises. Now it happens that already
a great number of interest rates are
controlled most bank rates, and
the rates charged by a number of
other lending institutions. Controls
could be extended outwards to smaller
lenders, but interest rates, like prices,
are not merely a matter of administra-
tion. There is a little matter of eco-
nomics, too.
So all these grand words seem to add
up to nothing but noises or else the
promise of blind interventionism. The
tragedy is that real issues are left un-
discussed, and the real alternatives left
unconsidered. The choice becomes
one between the complacent, conserva-
tive status quo, and a wild, unpre-
dictable unknown. The extremists, in
offering a “choice rather than an
echo” (to use Goldwater’s favorite
phrase), in fact do not, for most
people, offer a choice at all.
One of the greatest root problems
is that Labor still lives on the myth
that its opponents in Government are
free enterprise, laisser-faire men. The
fact of Canberra and the facts of large
Government departments and pro-
liferating agencies should make it
starkly clear that the principle of eco-
nomic intervention is well and truly
accepted. So there is no progress to
be had by an opposition through con-
tinued affirmation of what is accepted.
Progress must lie in looking at specific,
areas of economic life and trying to
work out whether more or less inter-
vention is required, and whether the
answers lie more in adhoccery or re-
turning to first principles.
Politics is mostly about economics
and foreign affairs. Unfortunately,
Labor seems unable to learn some
elementary facts about either. It hardly
deserves to be taken seriously as a
political proposition.


Less Run-around for Industry
By CROESUS
ONE of the outstanding achieve-
ments of the present Deputy
Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen, is
his practical recognition in administer-
ing the Department of Trade and
Industry of the essential dichotomy
between the primary and secondary
industrial sectors of the Australian
economy. As leader of the Country
Party he has demanded his pound of
flesh from the Liberal tranche in the
cosseting of rural interests, but at the
same time his department has, especi-
ally through its big say in the deter-
mination of tariffs and protection
generally, played a major role in the
advancement of secondary industry in
the past seventeen years.
Manufacturers might say that McEwen
should have done much more for them
and rather less for the farmers in
the matter of import restrictions, for
example and at times the Labor
Opposition has traded on this, but by
and large his impartiality cannot be
faulted. In any case it is up to the
manufacturers to push their own bar-
row and they have never been back-
ward at this, as the strength and
effectiveness of their Canberra lobby
attest.
One of the Government’s difficulties
in giving just weight to manufacturing
in the economic scheme of things has,
in fact, been the forcefulness of the
latter’s entreaties. Sometimes, such as
in 1961-62 when unemployment in
manufacturing industry was the main
component in the uncomfortable
national total, the Government has to
listen more attentively to these
entreaties for political reasons. On these
thankfully rare occasions it has been
inclined to overdo things and build into
the structure of protection assistance
which could be justified perhaps on
short-term employment considerations,
but in the long run abetted the growth
of uneconomic industry. Although the
Tariff Board was there both to use
and interpret the situation for the
Government, and in other ways, such
as by the institution of the Special
Adviser (Sir Frank Meere), the Gov-
ernment could get the necessary an-
swers, or at least some sort of answer,
this was not quite good enough.
WHAT seemed to be lacking was
a department of Government itself,
directly concerned with the whole area
of manufacturing industry, on whose
information the Government could
draw, not only when emergency
measures were needed to bolster
employment but also for the general
framing of its industrial policy. The
most tireless advocate that the gap
should be filled has been the Austra-
lian Industries Development Associa-
tion. In the end, of course, the Govern-
ment (or perhaps it was simply Mr.
McEwen himself) decided that manu-
facturing couldn’t have a whole
department for itself, but as a second-
best an Office of Secondary Industry
would be created within the Depart-
ment of Trade and Industry, leaving
the great bulk of the country’s indus-
trial activity securely within the pur-
view of Mr. McEwen.
This was a considerable feather in
AIDA’s cap, and the Office was duly
opened at the beginning of this year
by amalgamating the Manufacturing
Industries Division with the Tariff and
Imports Division and calling it the.
Office of Secondary Industries. This
seemed all very nice, but the big
question in many manufacturers’ minds
was whether this meant anything more
than a simple reorganisation and a
change of name. Mr. W. Callaghan,
the head of the Office, came down to
Melbourne recently to explain to more
than 150 business leaders at an AIDA
dinner to him that this was, in fact,
the breakthrough the manufacturers
have long been looking for. In place
of the old ad hoc approach to their
problems, he assured them that the new
set-up is being geared to tackle “the
basic problems of industry in co-
operation with industry.” The tackling,
he said, would be systematic and in
depth—“the Office is to develop and
play its part in the formulation of
proposals for Government policies for
the growth of a healthy secondary
industry.”
It seems pretty remarkable, though,
that, despite the admirable objects
of the new office, an officer of the
main Government department which
has been dealing with industry all
these years has, at this stage in our
industrial history, to admit that “we
will have to gather a sufficient know-
ledge of industry and we will have to
develop a sufficiently close contact with
industry to enable our officers to satis-
factorily assess the impact of Govern-
ment policies on the welfare and
development of secondary industry.”
Underlining the present unsatisfactory
position, Mr. Callaghan went on to
say “we must gain this knowledge and
we must effect this contact in a way
which will put us in a position to
develop policy proposals aimed at
industry growth and development.”
Maybe Mr. Callaghan was putting it
this way in a plea for co-operation
between the new office* and industry,
but I can’t believe he is really starting
off from scratch, at least on the infoi'-
mation side. It may seem a long time
since the Department of Trade ceased
publishing its excellent industry sur-
veys and even longer since it brought
out some of its comprehensive publica-
tions covering the whole make-up of
secondary industry (the first- of these
was early in the 1950 s as a result of
Mr. B. W. Hartnell’s massive investi-
gation when he was head of the
Secondary Industries Division) but if
the department has, in fact, been keep-
ing these up to date for internal, if
not for publication, purposes it must
already have a welter of information
to work on and countless contacts as
well.
Under the new arrangement, contact
points in the various States and in
Canberra will be on an industry group
basis' which, as Mr. Callaghan
explained, was the same under the old
one.
The Office would expect any firm or
industry with a problem to contact it
under one of these group headings in
the appropriate region or Canberra
“in the belief that there should be one
Government channel for industry to
contact and vice-versa.” Mr. Callaghan
hit the nail on the head when he
said “that there was a general aware-
ness of the difficulties of getting to
know the right people in Canberra.”
“It must make for better knowledge
on our part and on yours and it must
certainly avoid duplication if the vari-
ous sectors of industry have one
regular nominated contact point. If it
does nothing else, it could, perhaps,
eliminate what I would call the ‘run-
around’.”
it was looking at the
possible gains for industry on a
somewhat narrow basis, Mr. Callaghan
held out the hope that this arrangement
would assist deserving industries to get
their cases before the Tariff Board in
that the Office would be geared to take
a deep look at the problems of any
industry and to follow these through
to the .point of discovering the real
malady, be it import competition,
inefficiency, excess capacity, poor
marketing, or what have you. Yes.
But it would also be hoped that Mr.
Callaghan’s officers will succeed in sort-
ing out the wheat from the chaff, so
that those succeeding in getting their
applications to the Tariff Board will be
rather more worthy of the honor than
some of those in the past.
Obviously, the new office has great
ambitions. For, apart from its liaison
and fact-finding work, familiarisation
with Government policy and rounda-
bouts, it will essay a good deal else.
For instance, it intends to carry out a
comprehensive survey of the structure
of manufacturing industry. It will also
keep a tab on industry trends, inter
alia on an input-output basis, and on
social costs and benefits to the com-
munity of the various sectors of indus-
try. It will study problems of indus-
trial growth, location, infra-structure
establishment of new industries, and so
on. Altogether a mammoth prospectus.
I hope it won’t try to do too much
and that, as one would expect, it moves
in happy unison with the State Govern-
ments, who still have the jurisdiction
over industry in their areas, and the
powerful manufacturing organisations
who at present rule the roost in them.

A Case of Filial Pride
THE Victorian branch of the Aus-
tralian Shareholders’ Association,
which held its annual meeting
last week, hasn’t been doing anything
nearly as exciting ,as the somewhat
younger N.S.W. branch this past year,
but, in the true spirit of the movement
to get a better deal and say for share-
holders of public companies, isn’t at
all jealous.
Indeed, its annual report takes a sort
of filial pride in some of the things
happening over the border. One of
these is the appointment of Mr. Keith
Ridley as the first executive director of
the N.S.W. branch. So far Victoria
hasn’t got one, but hopes to. Then
there was that mammoth effort to
circularise 21,000 shareholders of Con-
crete Industries (Monier) to spur the
United States Government to settle the
dispute with the U.S. Navy arising out
of the North West Cape project.
One thing irkirig local members of
the association is the noticeable differ-
ence between the attitudes of the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments on
company failures. The annual report
notes that the Victorian authorities have
shown much greater reluctance to hold
official inquiries “even when prima
facie circumstances seem to warrant
such a move to restore public confi-
dence.” Again, the report finds it sur-
prising that the Victorian Government
hasn’t followed the N.S.W. pattern of
prosecutions, saying that “the N.S.W.
authorities, when charging company
directors, adopt the logical ‘one in, all
in’ policy, leaving the court to estab-
lish the degree of guilt of each; in Vic-
toria, instances occurred when only one
of several signatories to a prospectus
was proceeded against.”
TJ'HE Victorian branch devoted one
monthly meeting (August) to dis-
cussing the drastic reconstruction
scheme and the Ralli Bros, proposals
for Cox Bros. It was not alone in advo-
cating non-acceptance of these without
substantial amendments by the deben-
ture holders. It had invited Sir Frank
Richardson to address this meeting, but
he refused. As one of the audience re-
marked, “his refusal to come spoke for
itself.” Members seem to have been
with the trustee for the debenture
holders all the way in digging his
toes in.
There still seems plenty for the
Shareholders’ Association to do, both
in prodding official authorities to
streamline the Companies Acts for the
better protection of shareholders as
well as debenture funds and in keeping
at the company world in general to
improve the quality and scope of infor-
mation for shareholders’ benefit. The
AGs have some new amendments to
the Companies Acts in the pot, but
are hastening very slowly in bringing
them to the boil. Two of the main
ones concern the function of auditors.
One is that auditors of holding com-
panies should require the consent of
the Companies Auditors Board before
resigning. Mr. Rylah explains that this
would require disputes between manage-
ment and auditors to be aired at a
general meeting. The other proposal is
to empower auditors of holding com-
panies to require information from the
officers of subsidiary companies.
The need for both of these was
underlined by the recent investigator’s
report on Neon Signs (Australasia).
The former, in particular, gets at one
of the thorniest problems concerning
the functions of auditors, yet neither
really goes all the required way in
making auditors foolproof, let alone
accountants (for instance, the chief
accountant for NSA wasn’t even quali-
fied in his profession).
Mr. Rylah intends also to press arf
amendment to the Companies Acts at
the next AGs’ conference, aimed to
prevent one of the main weaknesses in
Reid Murray which Mr. B. L. Shaw
revealed in his final report on that
group issued here last week. The pro-
posal is to require companies to give
more precise information on the pros-
pective uses of public borrowings.

ONE OF A SERIES
The Rhine Riesling grapes used for Yalumba White Table
Wines are picked when the degree of sugar and acid are
in balance (12° beaume and 8% acid). Immediately after
gently crushing through a special roller mill to avoid
stalkiness the juice is completely separated from the
skins, seeds and stems. This reduces astringency and con-
tributes to the delicacy of the wine. Fermentation is care-
fully controlled at regulated low temperatures. The wine
is then carefully prepared for very early bottling to avoid
excessive exposure to air, in order to maintain its crisp
freshness and full Rhine Riesling bouquet.

ber of keen young
men who have

D. K. Hayward
is a more impressive list of Liberal Club
ex-presidents who have succeeded in
business rather than politics. Mr.
Gordon Barton, the head of Ipec, is
one. The latest addition is Mr. Don
K. Hayward, one of the two Australian
directors recently appointed to the
board of General Motors-Holden’s.
Thirty-four-year-old Don Hayward
was born five years after his predecessor
as GM-H’s public relations director,
Mr. Jack Horn, joined the company.
He learned the ropes at GM-H for
eight years as Mr. Horn’s assistant
before becoming the youngest director
in the whole General Motors group.
Born in Broken Hill, and schooled in
Sydney, he is a graduate of Melbourne
University (he finished the Law course
he began in Sydney at the University
of Melbourne as a part-time student in
what was then its Canberra University
College during his spare time as a
temporary public servant). {
His role is not merely heading a 33-
man team that tries to keep up GM-H’s
image with the public and its own
employees; he is also in charge of the
very delicate field of relations with
the Federal Government of the
“dialogue” with Canberra that is so
vital to the company’s position. It is
not only Don Hayward’s Liberal Club
background that suits him to this
task; he knows the Canberra political
arena well, having spent some years as
private secretary to my former boss
at the Department of National Develop-
ment, the late Senator Sir William
Spooner, and then to the President of
the Senate, Sir Alister McMullen.
Hayward’s responsibilities also cover
the forecasting of trends in the indus-
try and he now sees a fairly gloomy
outlook for motor registrations for the
next 12 months or so following the
latest depressed figures.
There could be some big things to
come from GM-H in smaller sporty
sorts of cars as well as the traditional
Holden market, where developments in
V 8 engines and aluminium are expec-
ted to give the company a real lift
while most of its rivals will be “locked
in” on their current lines of vehicle
development.


Macquarie Founds a Bank
By MALCOLM ELLIS
One hundred and fifty years ago
last Saturday a public meeting of
"magistrates and principal mer-
chants" in Sydney decided to set
up the Bank of New South Wales,
ihe first bank in Australia.
ONE of the most extraordinary fea-
tures of the commercial life of
early New South Wales was its
currency. In the very first decade of
Australian history it had none at all,
save for the assorted coins that found
their way into Sydney in the pockets of
trading captains and seamen, and very
often of convicts. Pieces of Eight, Maria
Theresa thalers, Spanish dollars im-
pressed with the stamps of Chinese
tongs in Macao or Canton pagodas,
moisdores, rupees, guineas, and, after
1800, huge pennies of copper made in
one and two ounces weight all served
The Bank of N.S.W. Head Office in George St., 1822
five years its foundation.
the purposes of those who had them.
But barter was the most common
method of paying one’s debts until the
great merchants had developed.
Mostly the barter value of work was
assessed in rum. The clergy complained
bitterly of this, but they nevertheless
practised the rum trade, and found it
very lucrative too The workmen who
built the first church up at the junction
of modern Hunter and Bligh Streets
were paid by one of the loudest clerical
complainers about the rum traffic, who
reckoned his rum wage rate at about
100 percent over what he had paid the
Government for the fiery spirit.
The Scottish Martyrs bought rum at
Rio at 1/6 a gallon and were rejoiced
to find its value so inflated in Sydney
that they could buy a goat, which would
have cost £lO in coin, for the equival-
ent of 30/- in spirits. When the Govern-
ment clamped down on their traffic they
joined in the shrill outcry that the
morals and industry of the poor con-
victs were being destroyed by official
laxity in controlling spirits trading.
When the merchants’ business be-
came large enough they joined trans-
actions in Bills of Exchange on London
(which, as often as not, some of them
did not meet when due) to another
system which ran parallel to the barter
system. The Government went on pay-
ing partly in rum and partly in Trea-
sury Bills for public works. But to this
was added a peculiar local currency.
This, in effect, was based on token notes
hand printed locally by the “Sydney
Gazette” for traders, farmers, publicans,
public servants, and anybody else who
could persuade his fellow men to take
his P.Ns. These were prudently printed
on the smallest possible pieces of the
worst paper that the issuer could pro-
cure. They were, in effect, no better
than cheques drawn on the Bank of
Hope, which the issuer fervently hoped
those who accepted them would mislay
or rot with their perspiration.
In time there was a conglomerate
mass of this so-called “currency” circu-
lating; so large an
amount, in fact,
that it soon pro-
vided a way in
which issuers could
make a nice profit.
The method by
which this was
done was as follows:
Mr. Jones (a res-
pectable merchant)
would issue as
much of the stuff as
he could persuade
customers to take
and, when his paper
promises added up
to a nice round
sum, he engaged
Mr. Robinson to go
round the town
whispering to all and sundry some j
thing like this: “Poor old Jones. He’s
up the spout! All his Bills protes-
ted in London. Got any of his currency?
Get rid of it at any price before the
news gets around!” Mr. Smith, to
whom this sage advice was given,
would hasten to half a dozen of his
friends with whom he happened to
be doing business and spread the news.
Soon everybody would be hammer-
ing at Jones’ door asking for cash.
Jones would not affirm or deny that he
was “up the spout,” but he would leave
a most unfavorable impression on his
questioners and then, either himself
or through an agent, offer to take
back his notes at a suitable discount.
He would as often as not make a profit.
Governor Macquarie did his best to
stop these practices and, in 1813, the
British Treasury, in response to his
demands, sent him £lO,OOO worth of
Spanish dollars, from which he
promptly had the centre excised by a
talented coiner. Ostensibly this was
done to prevent the silver leaving the
Colony. Actually, in the process, the
Government made a nice profit. It
rated the centre as
being worth Is 3d.
It was known as
a dump. The ring
that remained as
a separate unit be-
came the now-
famous “holey
dollar,” specimens of which today are
worth up to $lOOO. They ran current at
ss.
So enterprising a population as that
of New South Wales did not let the
Government have a monopoly of this
kind of business, through which one
could turn a 5s dollar into 6s 3d.
.merely by using a small hammer and
a sixpenny punch. Before long every-
body wjio could beg, borrow, or steal a
whole dollar from a simple sailor was
at work in the inflation industry.
Poor Macquarie was nearly distracted
with the combined results of these in-
genious proceedings. Currency and pay-
ment of wages at rum - inflated
prices (even by the Judge Advocate
Ellis Bent, who died at the end of
1815) combined to bring financial chaos
to the Colony by the middle of 1816.
Macquarie had always known the
remedy. His favorite measure was the
formation of a bank. Even before he
reached New South Wales, he had
been inspired at the Cape of Good
Hope, by Lord Caledon, the Governor
there, with the idea that Botany Bay
badly needed a bank. Lord Caledon
had just founded the Bank of the Cape
of Good Hope with the aid of Mr. J.
T. Campbell, a young Ulsterman from
Newry who had been trained in the
Bank of Ireland.
Whether he had no further use for
Mr. Campbell or not, he allowed Mac-
quarie to take him away to New South
Wales to be his secretary. No sooner
had they arrived in Port Jackson,
than the new Governor was pleading
with the home Government to let him
found a bank. The home Government
took not the slightest notice. It did
not like colonial banks sponsored by
colonial governors. The most peculiar
things happened to them.
However, by 1816, things were in

such a financial .mess in New South
Wales that the Governor decided to
act on his own initiative after taking
the advice of his new learned judge,
Mr. Judge Advocate John Wylde, who
thought he had power to act under his
Commission, but warned him that it
might be only inferential. With his
usual canniness Macquarie decided that
whatever must be done should be
done under the judicial -wing.
And thus, 150 years ago this month,
on November 19, 1816, following the
issde of a circular to “magistrates and
principal merchants,” a private meet-
ing was held under the chairmanship
of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde at his
chambers in the old building which
is now the Legislative Assembly sec-
tion of Sydney’s Parliament House. A
fortnight later another meeting was
held and the need for establishment
of sterling currency in the Colony
and of a bank affirmed.
The capital was set at £20,000 in
£lOO shares. The shareholders, who
offered in hordes to subscribe, included
Dr. D’arcy Wentworth, the treasurer of
the Police Fund, and a number of for-
mer convicts. The largest subscriber,
listed with all the members of the Gov-
ernor’s staff, was Mr. Eager, a distin-
guished Irish convict. Others were
Michael Massey Robinson, Australia’s
first poet laureate, and Simeon Lord,
the greatest of the ex-emancipist mer-
chants.
B Y February, proceedings were car-
ried to the point at which the first
board of directors was chosen by ballot,
with Mr. Campbell as president. The
directors were D’arcy Wentworth, Rob-
ert Jenkins, Dr. Redfern, Alexander
Riley, Thomas Wylde, the Judge Advo-
cate’s father, and Dr. John Harris. They
were sworn in by the Judge Advocate.
Thus, on February 7, 1817, came into
existence not only the first bank in the
Australian Antipodes but also the first
incorporated company.
The first depositor came along on
April 5, 1817, with £5O to put into an
account. He was Sergeant Jeremiah
Murphy of the 46th Regiment. By way
of balance the bank lost one of its direc-
tors, Mr. Alexander Riley, who resigned
because he felt insulted that the bank
would not accept his promissory notes
as cash deposits.
The foundation day of the bank was
fixed as the day on which it opened its
doors: April 8, 1817. The bank, from
one of Mrs. Reiby’s homes in Macquarie
Place, was soon issuing the first bank-
notes and token coins ever issued by an
Australian bank. None of this original
currency seems to have survived. And,
indeed, the bank itself had a narrow
escape from an early death since the
home Government failed to approve the
Charter issued by the Governor. It was
nearly 40 years before the coming of
the gold era rendered it sure of survival
under the repeated onslaughts of ambi-
tious rivals and the impact of the
peculiar habits of customers who made
bankruptcy one of the most practised
professions in Australia.

The Rewards of Battle
WILD CAT
PAGES
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
THERE are always some risks in-
volved in buying into takeover
fights. But the rewards likely from
buying into the F. W. Williams battle
seem well worth it. Both the Pioneer
Concrete and the Martin Corporation
bids offer a nice turn on the $4.05 price
of F. W. Williams shares, with the
Pioneer Concrete offer having the slight
edge of providing the cheapest entry
into this impressive company during all
its seven years’ life.
If Martin wins, the F. W. Williams
buyer gets a cash profit of 25 cents a
share less about nine cents for charges,
or about 16 cents clear, plus the right
to ACI shares at $2.59; in the more
likely event of Pioneer winning, the
F. W. Williams shareholder would be
buying Pioneer Concrete shares at 97
cents, compared with their market price
of $1.17, and the right to buy ACI
shares at $2.59, compared with their
current price of $2.75 which seems
a good deal in anybody’s language.
But some people consider the Pioneer
bid has been helped along by the mar-
ket in its shares being kept artificially
high, and that therefore the market
will fall when normal market condi-
tions return, especially since there will
be many more Pioneer shares around if
the takeover succeeds. On the other
hand, there appear to have been some
unusual selling pressures in the market,
too, and these may well depart when
the tumult and shouting of the current
battle dies.
The main thing is whether Pioneer
is a good company to invest in. Its
record is sound, and Pioneer has good
reasons for wanting the Williams group,
not only for its cash break-up potential.
Managing-director Mr. Tris Antico
believes that many of F. W. Williams
operations can usefully be integrated
into the Pioneer operation (“we even
have our own plastics division”) and it
may be useful to have an engineering
operation to look after its enormous
maintenance requirements.
There is no doubt that Pioneer faces
some problems; it would clearly like
to have control of Farley’s stone quar-
ries in Sydney, for example. But its
profits should continue to rise; Pioneer’s
cash takeover of Rowlands Quarries
should provide the company with
enough extra earnings next year at
least to maintain last year’s earning rate
of 24 percent, quite apart from any
proceeds from Williams.
HAS the market overdone it? A
good result, a cheerful chair-
man’s address and some buying
recommendations by brokers and in-
vestment counsellors has lifted Mt.
Morgan shares to around the $2.85
mark. And on top of this has been a
suggestion that Mt. Morgan’s pyrites
could be mixed with Broken Hill
South’s phosphate rock (recently dis-
covered near Cloncurry) to make fer-
tiliser.
This month’s first edition of the Min-
ing Investment Digest, put out by the
Cowan Investment Survey gi'oup in
Melbourne, warns that the world out-
look for copper prices is somewhat less
exuberant than in 1965-66 and it
“would not entirely discount” the pos-
sibility of a fall in copper prices (but
not of major dimensions) in the
medium term, while in the short term
prices are “a little suspect.” But it
stresses that copper prices are still
well in advance of the average prices
realised by Australian producers in
1965-66 and possibly will remain so
for the first half of 1966-67. (The local
CPA price for copper of $ll5O a ton
compares with 1965-66 average prices
received by B. H. South of $829, Mt.
Isa of $BOB, Mt. Lyell of $914, Mt.
Morgan of an estimated $B7O, Peko
of $837.)
The Cowan survey does not expect
an unduly high rate of capital gain
for local copper producers, particularly
in the short term, although it does not
dismiss the copper industry as an in-
vestment medium. Mt. Morgan, it says,
holds quite a deal of appeal (and Mt.
Isa is “not without merit” at the cur-
rent price). One part of Mt. Morgan’s
appeal is that, in the 16 weeks to Oct-
ober 23, the company produced 2256
tons of blister copper compared with
only 942 tons in the drought affected
corresponding period of last year (rep-
resenting an income rise already of
more than $1.2 million), so that the
current year’s result is sure to be, as
the chairman reported to the annual
meeting, “significantly better than for
the past year.”
Although certain Melbourne broking
houses are predicting a profit per share
of $1.20 in 1966-67, compared with 35c
last year to July 3, the chairman re-
fused to be drawn on precise profit
forecasts. Mount Morgan made a loss
in the first half of 1965-66 because
drought curtailed production, but
turned in a profit 43 percent better
than the year before, thanks to pro-
vidential rains and soaring copper
prices.
Even though the company’s iron ore
and bauxite interests are taking some
of its cash (as did its disastrous tem-
porary activities in gravel), share-
holders can reasonably expect a big
hand-out sooner or later from Mt.
Morgan especially if it can do a
pyrites deal. As the chairman told the

such a good position. Mt. Lyell ap-
pears to face a lower profit for the
year if prices ease much more (its
closer relation to world prices last
year meant that it did better in price
terms than other local producers and
therefore now stands to lose more in
any downturn). In addition, the first
12 weeks’ copper output this financial
year from Mt. Lyell is down 232 tons
at 3547 tons (representing a drop in
income of about $200,000).
NOW that ODE shares have moved
down to their year’s low, around
the 46 cents mark ex the one-for-
ten bonus share issue to give a divi-
dend yield of 8.7 percent, a Sydney
broker has added his opinion to that
of THE BULLETIN of two weeks
ago that the market appears to have
been too harsh indeed in its treatment
of this oilfield equipment company.
In a letter to clients, the broking
house “understands” that the company’s
results for the first quarter of 1966
exceed those for the comparative period
of last year and the company is con-
fident that the results for the first
six months, on the basis of firm con-
tracts presently held, will also exceed
those for the corresponding period last
year.
“The upsurge in geophysical work
augurs well for future drilling commit-
ments,” the letter says, and regards
the sudden markdown in the company’s
35 cent shares as “unwarranted”
especially in view of the proposed
dividend increase to 4 cents a share
(or 11.4 percent).
The broker points out that only three
of the company’s 11 rigs are idle and
that two of these are the company’s
oldest and have been fully depreciated,
so that the industry downturn (which
has meant that more than half the
rigs in Australia are out of work) has
had “no repercussions as far as ODE
is concerned.” “Consumables from the
supply company would be moving
more slowly, but as the bulk of in-
come is derived from contract drilling
this has only a minor effect on group
profit.”
The key question is how much
longer the eight rigs now under con-
tract will remain working, and it
appears that their future will be a
busier one than the current market
price suggests.
IT will probably need more than the
recent big advertising campaign
and last week’s management
changes to solve all the problems fac-
ing linoleum and vinyl floor covering
maker Michael Nairn and Co. (Aus-
tralia) Ltd., whose 50 cent shares are
now down around their year’s low of
29 cents.
The company’s problem is that, like
Minster, its main product is no longer
fashionable and that the alternatives
into which it has moved are, highly
competitive. But it has some good real
estate, and its high assets backing should
prevent it falling too much lower.
Michael Nairn’s associate company in
Canada (part of the U.K. headquarter-
ed group) is partly owned by the Power
Corporation of Canada, which reorgan-
ised and revitalised what had been a
run-down operation.
But last week’s replacement of former
general manager Mr. W. G. Hill by Mr.
Trevor Arnold, one of the Power Cor-
poration of Australia’s consultants for
the last six months or so (following his
resignation as general manager of Life
Savers), is understood to have no Power
overtones. The Australian branch of
Power is believed to have no interests
in the local Nairn company nor any
plans for taking any position in the
stock.
The Chartist says:
TOOTH & CO. seems to have lost its growth prospects, for the time being
at least. This stock has undoubtedly performed better than most market
leaders since 1960 and, although not spectacular, a steady 10 percent uptrend
has been maintained with an intermediate swing of approximately 30 percent
appreciation per annum for 1963 and 1964. The long-term trend on the chart
shows that prices have now moved out, away from the basic primary trendline,
and the price movements of recent months have taken on bearish implications.
Any fall below $4.90 would have definite technical significance and a downside
objective of about $4.00 would be a distinct possibility, although support would be
forthcoming about $4.50 from the low point of 1965. Investors should also be
aware of an even more pessimistic, target of about $3.10. Last sale price on
17/11/66 $5.00.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Amid a host of uncertainties, the markets are still looking
askance at the brewers, though Carlton and United recovered a
marginal 2 cents to $3.02 and R. W. Miller, for wider reasons,
put on 6 cents to touch $1.59. After lengthy doldrums, Minster
almost managed to recover the previous week’s loss, picking
up 28 cents to $2.43. Much excitement, of course, attended
CRA, which over the week added 60 cents, finishing at $6;
the jump immediately after the bonus announcement was 70
cents. Mount Isa’s lower copper production meant a 21 cent
decline to $4.18.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A and R's Assured Recovery
NOT even the British publishing
invasion has been able to halt the
“under new management” re-
covery by Angus and Robertson from
its 1964 nadir. And the prospects are
that despite the heavy increase in pub-
lishing competition, particularly in the
lucrative educational publishing field,
and despite the impact lower consumer
spending has had on other retailers,
the future for A and R’s publishing
and retailing operations looks quite
bright.
And the future for its other major
activity, printing, also seems assured.
Its contract to print the Pacific edition
of “Newsweek,” from February, 1966,
is a valuable connection “expected to
develop.”
Beset by managerial and directorial
squabbles, takeover bids made and
received, A and R had a very turbu-
lent history in recent years.
The 25 percent profit jump this year
to $356,586 boosted earning rate to
20.6 percent from the recent average
of about 15 percent. The dividend rate,
which had been at 15 percent for 16
years, was cut to 14 percent in 1962
after the two rather questionable
bonuses in 1959 and 1960 the folly
of which was demonstrated in 1963,
when the dividend had to be scaled
down to the present 12 percent. The
company could be aiming at an
eventual restoration of its old rate.
The major reason for the latest im-
provement was a marked lift in returns
from retailing. The retail division,
which has been the weakest and least
profitable section of the business since
the company was engorged by its take-
over campaign of 1960, still has the
greatest scope for further improvement
of sales and profits, according to direc-
tors. Rationalisation of the properties,
remodelling and reorganisation of the
remaining stores, and conversion to
semi-self-service methods have obviously
cut costs and improved sales.
'J'HE company expects to hold its own
in publishing, despite the increasing
competition, because of the rapidly
rising market, particularly in the educa-
tional field. Publishing is an integral
part of the A and R activities, with
educational books, mainly for secondary
schools, being its major single publish-
ing activity. It is now moving into
primary and touching on tertiary books.
Fiction, general, and children’s books
together make up about 60 percent of
A and R’s publishing. Three years ago
A and R published perhaps 80-100
titles of all kinds, today it is 125-150
new books, about 20 percent of the
Australian output. There is a definite
tendency for editions to increase, too,
as the market grows with the popular
tion.
The printing division, giving the best
return on funds employed, consists of
Halstead Press at Kingsgrove, prob-
ably the biggest and most successful
book printery in Australia, and the
much smaller Melbourne business of
J. C. Stephens Pty.
The company now has only $81,378 in
unissued capital, so is increasing nom-
inal capital from s2m. to pre-
sumably not for the purpose of raising
new capital from shareholders but to
provide scope for small takeovers for
a share consideration or partly in shares.
Far from making those issues, the
company has announced its intention
of raising money by mortgaging some
of its properties.
Commitments for capital expenditure
are down from $215,000 to $90,000 at
1966 balance date. The company has
run down its cash position in the past
year. Stocks and work in progress rose
from $2.48m. to $2.69m. and debtors
rose by $30,000, financed by a rise in
creditors from $772,000 to $951,000,
and a reduction in the amount A and
R had out on mortgage from $244,000
in 1965 to only $50,000 in 1966.
The rise in trade debtors of a
mere three percent to $949,000 is not
comparable with the 13.8 percent in
total sales for the year. This cqnfirms
that retailing, which accounts for 'more
than half the turnover, experienced
much better results. -
The first four months of the cur-
rent year brought a 13.3 percent sales
improvement. . s
Primarily an _ income stock, A and
R shards are now around $1.15, yield-
ing . 5.2 percent, and provide better
value than at almost any time in the
past five years.

U.S. Moves on Copper
,tr |
RUMORS suggest two possible
moves by the U.S. Government
with opposite effects for copper
markets.
First there is growing speculation
that military set-asides the part of
their output that producers and fabri-
cators must apply to military uses
will be lifted to 25 percent of total
output. At present 18 percent is offici-
ally “set-aside”, but a recent amend-
ment to procedure is said to lift this
effectively to 22 percent. The lift to
25 percent is forecast for early next
year. U.S. officials only comment that
an increase is “possible.”
On the other hand, a further release
of 200,000 short tons (of 20001 b.) from
Government stockpiles is predicted in
market circles. At present the copper
stockpile is below its target holding
only 400,000 tons. Observers are talking
of a temporary release, to be re-
purchased next year.
The fact that the metal released
would go for military purposes
though not for the full-scale conflict
originally intended as the stockpile’s
purpose lends weight to the argu-
ment.
Meanwhile, on the production front,
indications point to Zambian smelters
being able to maintain their present
level of output 66 percent of nor-
mal. For the next three months, until
new trucks and locomotives begin to
join the rail network, the transport
position will be strained but, barring
unforeseen problems, coal should be
available To operate smelters at pre-
sent levels.
A factor not to be forgotten is the
build-up in stocks of copper concen-
trates in Zambia. Although coal short-
ages have cut smelter production, min-
ing continues virtually as usual.
The next six months seem likely to
be hectic ones in the copper markets,
and prices could, given the right com-
bination of circumstances, break all
previous records. But extra transport
and coal production facilities in Zam-
bia will be available early next year.
The copper market is now, much
more so than when Chilean miners’
strikes were the centre of attention,
not a place for the faint-hearted.
A FURTHER move to improve the
world cotton production balance
with consumption may follow a recent
study in Uganda. A committee of
enquiry set up by the Government to
investigate the country’s cotton industry
has suggested abolition of the support
price paid by the Government, at
present 50 percent higher than the free
market.
The U.S. Government has been
making moves to end the artificial
market situation in that country and
to reduce the stockpiles accumulated
in recent years. The short-term effect
has been to depress the world market,
but, eventually, if other nations also
follow the example, l a healthier situa-
tion should develop.
This is of interest in Australia not
only as a warning against irresponsible
encouragement of local production
but as a hopeful sign for local pro-
ducers, who are affected by world
prices to an increasing extent.
MINING
Two Tin Miners Diverge
SOME weeks ago the shares of
Ravenshoe Tin Dredging Ltd.
and Tableland Tin Dredging N.L.
were both standing at $4. Since then
the divergence in their respective share
prices has been quite remarkable.
While Ravenshoe have risen to $4.65
and are currently standing at $4.35,
Tableland shareholders have seen theif
shares fall away to $2.50. The buoy-
ancy of Ravenshoe shares is under-
standable, as the rise followed the
announcement of the company’s inten-
tion to make a one-for-one bonus issue,
but Tableland shareholders may well
wonder whether there is any good
reason behind the drop in their com-
pany’s market valuation.
In October the chairman of Table-
land, Mr. L. W. Doggett, told share-
holders that production of tin con-
centrates from existing, operations at
Smith’s Creek would continue for at
least two years, after which large areas
of tailings will remain. The profitability
of dredging these tailings will depend
on the price of tin, but costs will be
lower while dredging such areas.
Should the price of tin remain at a
satisfactory level, the lower costs will
largely offset the reduced yield obtain-
able from dredging these areas of tail-
ings.
In 1966, Tableland produced 928
tons of concentrates. For the next two
or three years production will be rather
less —at the annual meeting the chair-
man said he expected a figure of 600
tons of tin concentrates per annum.
At the end of this time it is expected
that tailings will provide about six
years’ work. Production from these
tailings is likely to yield perhaps 500
tons of . tin concentrates per annum and
the chairman has stated that provided
the present relationship is maintained
between the price of tin and operating
costs there is every reason to believe

she’s beautiful even when quiet
Take the wheel of any 1967 Pride boat (there are eleven of them), hit the throttle and
Pride's famous deep “V”hull goes into action. You'll ride high, you'll ride dry, you'll
ride smoothly in the most comfortable deep contoured seats yet placed in a pleasure boat.
Then comes the inner satisfaction of being surrounded by quality
and finish justifying your astuteness in choosing a Pride.
You become aware of features like the one-piece hull being constructed of heavy duty
fibreglass fibres and top quality plastic resins. Positive flotation of Pride craft because
of polyurethane foam pumped under the floor, binding stringers, hull and floor together
as one unit. The special acrylic tinted windscreen to take care of the glare.
Let your wife choose the colour scheme. There's Blue Marine, Panama Green, Desert
Gold or Kimberly Red with matching interior colour schemes.
All in all, no other boat will give you the exhilarating performance of a 1967 Pride
she's beautiful even when quiet.

that the dredging of tailings will be
quite profitable.
. Taking a price of £stgl2oo per ton
for tin, total revenue from produc-
tion of 600 tons of concentrates
would be in the vicinity of $1.2 mil-
lion. Costs for the current year will
be lower, as the maintenance stoppage
incurred by the company during Sep-
tember last was provided for out of
last year’s profit, while a lower dredge
throughput should also allow a saving
in costs. Overall costs should not exceed
$1 million and could well be less than
this figure, to give a net profit of
$200,000 for each of the next two to
three years, after which time the cost
savings involved in the retreatment
of tailings could make quite a differ-
ence, particularly in regard to power
consumption and general maintenance.
These savings could easily mean that
profit from tailings exceeds $200,000
a year.
Thus, Tableland shareholders can
look forward to earnings of perhaps 45
cents or more per share for the next
eight or nine years, without taking into
account the prospects for finding addi-
tional ground suitable for dredging and,
although it appears to be running out
of rich tin-bearing ground, the com-
pany remains fairly rich in assets. After
providing for dredge maintenance and
other provisions, the balance sheet at
June 30, 1966, revealed about $1 per
share of current assets.
J*AVENSHOE, on the other hand, has
a life of ten years in virgin ground
without any allowance for the re-
treatment of tailings. The company
commenced dredging in the Nettle
Creek areas in November, 1965, after
spending more than seven years in
Battle Creek, where it began dredging
in 1957. Battle Creek contained 16
million cubic yards of ore-bearing
ground, while Nettle Creek contains 15
million yards and, in 1965, the com-
pany added another 1\ million yards
to these areas, although this addition
was of a rather lower grade.
At an average throughput of 2.3
million cubic yards per annum, and an
average grade of .491 b. of ore per
yard, Ravenshoe’s dredge should pro-
duce at a rate of about 500 tons of
concentrates per annum, to give 360
tons of tin metal at an average assay
of 72 percent. (Actual figures may be
higher than this in the next few years
while the dredge is in higher-than-
average grade ground.) At £stgl2oo,
average revenue per year should be in
the vicinity of $1 million while dredge
operating costs should be no more than
$400,000 per annum, allowing for some
reduction on the 1966 figure of 20.46
cents per cubic yard, following greater
throughput, once the dredge operates
for a full twelve months. From the
working profit of $600,000, depreciation,
tax, royalties, and administration will
probably absorb about $336,000 to give
a net profit of $264,000 after tax, but
before allowing for any sums spent on
boring and testing. This item could
easily reduce net profit from dredging
operations to $200,000 per year, equiva-
lent to 25 cents per share.
But, in addition to dredging, Ravens-
hoe has proved substantial yardages
suitable for treatment by mobile plant.
It began working these areas during
1965 and to date has proved reserves
containing in excess of 2 million cubic
yards of high-grade ore. On last year’s
rate of treatment (369,000 cubic yards),
these are sufficient for six years’ opera-
tions, while additional reserves have
been indicated. It is difficult to make
an estimate of the future profitability
of this mobile plant, as operations in
the past two years have been inter-
mittent. In 1965, the company attri-
buted $46,000 of its working profit to
this plant on production of 38 tons of
concentrate; in 1966, when the plant
operated for only eight months of the
year, and at only 64 percent of capacity
during that time, 123 tons of concen-
trate was produced and profit attri-
buted to mobile operations was $87,000.
For the future, increased output
from this plant could make a con-
siderable difference to overall earn-
ings— in December, 1964, the com-
pany stated that, at a tin price of
£stgl2oo per ton, this plant would
yield a surplus of $250,000 from the
production of 260 tons of ore over 9-12
months, from the treatment of lower-
grade ore than that treated in the past
two years. After allowing for increased
costs over the past two years, the mobile
plant could easily add another $120,000
(or 15 cents per share) to net profits
when it operates on a more regular
basis.
At $4.35 then, cum a one-for-one
bonus, Ravenshoe shares are backed
by a life of ten years or more with
annual earnings at a rate of perhaps
40 cents per share, while Tableland
shareholders can look forward to earn-
jngs of around 45 cents per share for
the next eight or nine years. How-
ever, Tableland’s future operations in
areas of tailings will be far more
dependent on the price of tin than
Ravenshoe’s dredging operations in
virgin ground. Ravenshoe’s operation
would break even at a tin price of less
than £stg9oo, whereas Tableland
would require perhaps £stglooo or
more to stay in the black.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Taubmans for Counter-cyclists
CURRENTLY the shares of Taub-
mans Industries Limited are sell-
ing at 89 c to give an immediate
dividend yield of 9.0 percent and are
priced at 10.7 times 1964-65 earnings.
The shares have been as low as 76c
this year, which is the lowest price
since the 1961 year, in which the com-
pany’s earning rate (adjusted for the
July, 1964, l-for-10 bonus issue) was
only 10.8 percent. Those “counter-
cyclical” investors who bought Taub-
mans shares in the 1961 calendar year
could have made a capital gain of
nearly 170 percent within four years
had they bought at the lowest point in
1961 and sold at the highest point in
1964. Conversely, those investors who
bought in at the 1965 high price of
$1.70 would now be suffering a paper
capital loss of nearly 50 percent.
These significant share price fluctua-
tions are somewhat surprising when con-
sidered against the record of Taubmans
since 1960-61. In this year the company
felt the full effects of the “recession”
which followed the Government’s anti-
inflationary measures, since the worst-
affected sectors were the building and
motor-vehicle industries, each import-
ant users of paint.
After making adjustments for the
dilutional effect of the 1964 bonus issue,
the trend in per share dividends and
earnings has been:
Year to Sept. 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Per share dividends
c ent J 9.2 13.7 13.7 15.3 16.0
Per share earnings
cen *s 10.8 17.1 17.4 19.4 18.6
Of course, the strong growth shown
in both these series is due partly to the
use of the 1960-61 results in the base
period. However, even if the 1959-60
results are used for the base period,
Taubmans per share dividends have
since increased by 42 percent and its
per share earnings by 41 percent. It is
interesting to note that the company
has always paid out a high percentage
of its earnings in the form of dividends.
SIGNIFICANT proportion of the
improvement in profitability during
the ’6os appears to have come from cost
economies achieved rather than from
improved sales alone. According to the
1965 accounts, sales have increased by
less than 10 percent since 1959-60,
whilst in the same period profits before
tax and depreciation have increased by
over 26 percent. Taubmans’ major in-
vestment expenditure in this period has
been on its new Villawood, N.S.W.,
factory and warehouses, built at a cost
of over $4 million and financed entirely
from internal sources. During 1962-3,
production of decorative paints was
transferred from the St. Peters plant,
whilst in August, 1964, the company
completed the transfer of its warehouse
distribution activities to Villawood
alongside its production activities. The
cost savings from this overall rearrange-
ment were expected to be “consider-
able.” At the new Villawood factory,
Taubmans has a weekly capacity of
50,000 gallons, which represents over 35
percent of its total weekly capacity
throughout Australia and New Zealand.
After the close of the 1964-5 financial
year the old St. Peters plant was sold
on terms, and the results for the finan-
cial year just ended will have benefited
from the lower payments for rates,
taxes, and maintenance costs, as well
as the interest received on the loan
made to the purchaser.
As the balance-sheet summary
figures indicate, Taubmans’ investments
in associated companies are now quite
significant. These associated companies
comprise: ICP-Hoechst Pty. Ltd. (49
percent owned), Embecon Pty. Ltd.
(50 percent), Fiji Paint Ltd. and Taub-
mans (N.G.) Pty. Ltd. In the nine
months ended September 30, 1965, the
parent company, Taubmans Industries
Ltd., received only $15,464 in dividends

from “unlisted companies.” However,
it is likely that these dividends will rise
substantially in the future, as the in-
dividual companies become firmly
established.
One of the problem spots for the
company has been its printing inks
division, which has operated at a loss
for the past two years. (In 1963-64,
for instance, Taubmans’ parent com-
pany’s earnings exceeded the consoli-
dated earnings by over $100,000.) At
the last annual meeting, though, the
chairman stated that the directors were
confident this activity would become
profitable during 1966.
Taubmans’ 1965-6 interim report
announced that, whilst sales closely
approximated those of the previous
year, net profit had been affected by
increased wages and competitive pres-
sures, more than offsetting increased
operating efficiency. In view of the
“difficult trading conditions,” net profit
for 1965-6 was expected to be “some-
what less” than the 1964-5 result.
Interim dividend was held steady at
the previous year’s higher rate of
percent (3.75 cents per share).
'J'HERE is little doubt that, since this
report was issued, conditions in the
motor-vehicle and domestic-appliance
industries have remained sluggish, and
this has doubtless affected Taubmans,
as at least half of its total gallonage is
directed toward these markets.
In the case of architectural and
decorative paints the lower current rate
of new dwelling construction, coupled
with the more intensive advertising and
sales-promotion campaigns that are a
feature of competition based on product
differentiation, have caused profitability
to decline.
Nevertheless, despite the prospects
of a much-reduced earning rate in the
year just ended, and a possible slightly
reduced dividend rate, it is a sobering
thought to consider the market price
and profitability recovery that followed
the difficult 1960-1 year. “Counter-
cyclists” could again well consider pur-
chasing Taubmans’ shares at these very
depressed levels.

MAN ON THE LAND
Federating the Farmers
MUCH to the surprise of many
who believe that farmers cannot
agree on anything, the National
Farmers’ Union and the Australian
Primary Producers’ Union meet in
Sydney on Friday (Nov. 25) to for-
mulate a policy for an Australian
Farmers’ Federation. The two bodies
agreed, in principle, to a merger in
Canberra early this month. The Aus-
tralian Farmers’ Federation would
appear likely to be in existence, as a
going concern, some time next year,
This is a big thing in farmer unity,
but it should be remembered that the
Australian Farmers’ Federation is ij,ot
quite what it sounds. It includes all
farming organisations except the
organisation which is the oldest and
the wealthiest the Australian Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council. This,
obviously, is a rather significant flaw
in any organisation purporting to repre-
sent all Australian farmers.
But it should not be taken for granted
that the Graziers will never see eye to
eye with the organisations making up
the Farmers’ Federation. Indeed, until
a year ago, the Graziers were members
of the National Farmers’ Union aijd
actually supplied the NFU president,
R. J. McAuley, of South Australia, who
played a big part in the events lead-
ing up to the NFU link with the Aus-
tralian Primary Producers’ Union.
McAuley tried hard to keep the
Graziers in the NFU and, had he suc-
ceeded, a completely unified farm
organisation would now be in the
offing. The Graziers withdrew for a
number of reasons. The main factor
was the purely practical issue of the
monetary contributions necessary to
keep the NFU afloat.
The other reasons were not unimpor-
tant. But many organisations which
never considered leaving the NFU
shared the Graziers’ doubts in the fin-
ancial area. This resulted in the NFU
being unable to continue as a member
of the International Federation of Agri-
cultural Producers, the world body
which draws representatives from all
countries except the Communist bloc.
The Australian Primary Producers’
Union sought, and obtained, recognition
by the international body. Having done
so it was faced with the problem of
financing itself into world farming
affairs.
ir pHE creation of the new Australian
Farmers’ Federation will, therefore,
almost immediately resolve the impor-
tant matter of Australian participation
in IFAP. This, alone, will be an
achievement. The new body should
have a budget of around $50,000 a year
and this should permit adequate in-
ternational forays.
Away from this sometimes remote (to
the man on the land) level, the likeli-
hood of any quick returns to the NFU
(or the new Australian Farmers’ Feder-
ation) by the Graziers is the big ques-
tion. A quick return does seem un-
likely.
The one man who might have swung
it, McAuley, was dropped by his own
NFU at the recent Canberra meeting
after he had done so much to bring
the Australian Farmers’ Federation idea
to fruition. He was not present him-
self, being ill, and the assembled dele-
gates elected Mr. F. McEvoy, a Queens-
land cane grower, in his place. We
understand that the question of Mc-
Auley’s eligibility as president was
raised. This is not surprising. Remem-
ber he was originally a Graziers dele-
gate and then, shortly after he became

president, the Graziers withdrew from
the NFU.
We were one of the people who won-
dered how he could continue as presi-
dent, following the walk-out by his
own organisation, but the NFU con-
stitution, we were told, permitted the
president to act independently. For
the period of his presidency he became,
so to speak, a man without an organis-
ation.
It is understood that the NFU, in
Canberra, a few weeks ago ruled that
McAuley was no longer eligible for
membership and therefore could not
continue as president. The matter was
referred, we believe, to a lawyer and
the Department of Primary Industry.
The lawyer seems reasonable as a matter
of the constitution was involved. But
why the Department of Primary In-
dustry? This is the first time, to our
knowledge, that any meeting of farmers
has asked the Department of Primary
Industry to rule on an internal matter.
McAuley, a man of stature and con-
siderable personal wealth, has been
rather active in recent months taking
Government tariff policy apart. “The
big bloke,” as he is sometimes referred
to, can be scathing and, to some people,
outspoken. His views on tariffs run
along the same general lines as those of
Mr. Kelly (the South Australian MP
who has made tariffs his special cause),
the Vernon Report, and the retiring
chairman of the advisory Australian
Tariff Council, Mr. J. C. Harris, who
has criticised departmental aloofness
and power in deciding tariff issues.
M R - HARRIS has also pleaded for a
“bench mark” and this has lately
been taken up strongly by Woolgrowers
and Graziers’ Council economist, G. D.
Chislett. McAuley, in one of his last
Press releases as NFU president, made
a strong attack on what he termed De-
partment of Trade and Industry inter-
ference with the Tariff Board.
It will be interesting to see if the
new NFU president follows up the
McAuley line on tariffs. It will be
interesting, too, to observe the tariff
policy of the new Australian Farmers’
Federation.
In unity matters it would appear to
make little difference which political
party wins the Federal election on
November 26. Instead of complete farm
unity we will have, in marked fashion,
the “two party” system developing in
the near future.
Attempting, at long range, to define
the roles of each “party,” it may be
that the Australian Farmers’ Federation
will be the group which will accept, and
encourage, farm subsidies and price
supports. It will try to secure as big a
slice of the cake as possible but will
not attempt to alter the subsidy trend
evident in the policies of both Liberal
and Labor. The Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council, on the other hand,
may attempt to secure its slice of the
cake the other way, by constant pres-
sure for less protection of Australian
secondary industry and arrest of the
cost-price spiral.

AGRISEARCH
Skeleton Weed under Control
MANY among those who ought to
know say that skeleton weed
(Chondrilla juncea) is the worst
weed of cultivation in Australia. It
first caused concern in the Wagga
district after being introduced in fod-
der imported from the U.S.A. to save
starving stock during the severe drought
of' 1914. Now, after having spread
rapidly, it is more or less coincident
with the lighter soils of the wheatbelt
in south-eastern Australia. Last year,
or the year before, it crossed the Nullar-
bor Plain and scattered patches are
appearing in the vast wheatlands of
the west. Back east, the weed has put
more than a few wheatgrowers out of
business, seriously cut the harvests of
a great number, and fouled up harvest-
ing machines on innumerable occa-
sions.
In America, skeleton weed is not
regarded as a problem and Thomas
Edison, of gramophone fame, even
thought it might be possible to turn it
into an economic crop if only he could
succeed in making rubber from the
sticky latex of its root. Here, however,
it robs our much less well-endowed
soils of more nitrogen and water than
can be spared by the growing wheat.
At harvest-time it causes exasperating
and costly delays by becoming
entangled in the comb and cutter bar
of the header. In pasture it is not
bothersome, and, in fact, its density
declines. Herein lays the clue to a
practical means of control. Simply find
an economic way of hiding its young
flat rosettes from the light and at the
same time, if possible, negate its com-
petitiveness for nitrogen.
Mr. G. J. Wells, of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture, has been
operating this principle with striking
success in Mallee country, where the
prospect of controlling skeleton weed
was gloomiest. By establishing lucerne
on this light land, he finds that in
second-year stands the number of skele-
ton weed rosettes has been reduced to
less than 20 percent of their original
population. In loamy soils it takes an
extra year, sometimes two, to achieve
the same result. At the same time, how-
ever, the lucerne has been building up
the nitrogen level of the soil and this
boosts both the yield and protein con-
tent of wheat sown subsequently. Mr.
Wells has harvested approximately
twice the amount of wheat from a crop
grown after lucerne than from a crop
grown alongside after volunteer pasture.
He has also found that field peas
were another effective legume crop for
rotation with wheat on light country
heavily infested with skeleton weed.
Both of these legumes are so much
more effective competitors under the
low rainfall of the Mallee than the
annual medics and clovers which have
already been used to suppress skeleton
weed in the better-favored districts.
The smothering effect of the medics
and clovers is inadequate in the Mal-
lee and in the drier parts of the New
South Wales wheatbelt. Probably,
lucerne works so well because it com-
petes for water rather than light. Both
are deep-rooted perennials and the
lucerne does not grow thickly, at least
at first.
JNDEED, the main difficulty that the
Wells method has encountered is in
obtaining good establishment of lucerne
in the first year. But it would seem that
patience outweighs the misfortune of a
sparse start, for the lucerne progres-
sively suppresses the skeleton weed with
each succeeding year. One gets the im-
pression from Mr. Wells’ experiments,
which have been running for only three
years, that if infested land was sown to
lucerne and left for a fairly long term
without cultivation the weed might be
virtually eradicated. At least it should
be reduced to the point where spot
spraying with chemicals would become
a practical proposition.
Chemical eradication is being
attempted in Western Australia, where
the infestations are still restricted to
small isolated patches. It is also being
employed on the fringes of badly
infested areas in the south-eastern
States in the hope of slowing down the
rate of spread of the weed; Most of
the research on chemical control has
also been carried out in Victoria. That
State’s Department of Lands has
shown that the herbicide 2,3,6-TBA
applied at the rate of 241 b. per acre
gives a total kill. But the cost —about
$l2O an acre —is prohibitive except for
treating small areas or occasional
plants. On this account the Department
is now experimenting with a newer
herbicide, known as picloram. Pre-
liminary trials suggest that it will kill
as reliably as the earlier chemical and
at a much lower cost —say $25 an acre.
Even at this price, of course, it will
have to be used sparingly, such as for
mopping-up after suppression by
lucerne.
Yet another alternative for the
farmer beset by skeleton weed is to
feed nitrogen to both the weed and
the wheat. The principle here seems
to be “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.”
Fertilising with nitrogen promotes the
growth of both, but it is possible for
the farmer to do better than break
even. Trials at Walpup, in the Vic-
torian Mallee, have shown that the
most profitable level of fertilisation
is 1801 b. ammonium sulphate together
with 1201 b. of superphosphate per acre.
By hook or by crook wheat production
in Australia will remain in the wheat-
belt and will not decline.

Why Won't Markets Respond?
Some reflections on asset backing
ONE of the main reasons people used to buy shares was to offset the effect of
inflation. Supposedly, share prices reflected the increased price level in the
economy. But with the market at a level 10 percent lower than it was six
years ago, the matter has become a little confusing. This mark-down in share
prices is much greater than most non-investors realise.
It’s out of fashion to use asset back-
ing as a guide in trying to determine
the current value of a share. Neverthe-
less, if you did look at share prices
from this angle, it’s fair to say that the
excess of current market price over the
asset backing represents the goodwill
that the market expects you to pay to
enter into an established business with
experienced management.
What does it mean when asset back-
ing is in excess of market value? In
effect, it is a measbre of the lack of con-
fidence in that business by the outside
investor. If the market price shows no
sign of ever rising to this asset backing
and the assets could be realised at a
price approximating the book value, then
surely the company should be liquid-
ated.
Our market has reached the stage
where in theory many companies are
in that predicament. A sorry state of
affairs for a country which is supposed
to be on the threshold of dynamic
growth.
Local investors have had such a
rough time with falling share prices
that they now need some positive
government encouragement to entice
them back into the market. Establish-
ing a fund to support the market, as
the Japanese Government did, is prob-
ably too extreme an action to con-
sider in our market. A more moderate
approach to this problem, employed by
the Canadian Government, was to sub-
ject dividends to a lower rate of tax.
What baffles most people, and this
includes myself, is the complete lack
of response of the sharemarket to the
improving economic conditions. The
answer does not lie in any lack of
liquidity. The heavy over-subscription
of the iecent Government loan and the
several industrial debenture issues prove
that there’s plenty of money around. It
must just be put down to the woeful
lack of confidence in industrial shares.
So once again I look to the mining
market for inspiration. In particular, I
direct my attention to Woodside.
When the BHP-Esso Marlin BI well
failed to produce any oil it looked as
though the bottom might drop out of
the Woodside market. Then in stepped
Sir Henry Bolte with a statement about
the estimated oil reserves in the Bass
Strait field. So when the market learnt
that there was enough oil to supply
all Australian requirements for the
next six years from this field, interest
started to revive. It should progres-
sively build up in the coming month.
The BHP-Esso drilling rig Glomar
111 is now in dry dock, but will com-
mence drilling a new well (Marlin Cl)
at the end of this month. Then, early
next month, Woodside will start sink-
ing its first offshore well (named Golden
Beach No. 1).
The most recent financial develop-
ment with Woodside has been the
announcement of a 5 cent call on both
the 45 cent paid and 10 cent paid
shares, payable on December 14. This
will make the now 45 cent paid shares
equal to the fully paid shares, so at this
stage there should be no more than
4 cents difference in market price
between these two. Consequently, I
settled on the 45 cent paid shares at
76 cents.
The funds to pay for this purchase
came from the sale of 100 Mt. Isa
shares at $4.20. While I think that
the company’s reservations about the
future are mainly political, it’s not
going to help the share price very
much. Just about offsetting this loss
was the profit of $6B on the 200 Pas-
siona Perth. Too good a price rise
to let go.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
100 Mt. Isa $4.20 $4ll
200 Passiona Perth $2.24 $439
BOUGHT
500 Woodside 45c pd. .76 $389
An amount of $620 is the credit
balance remaining in the account. If
necessary it will be used to take up
1000 G. J. Coles rights. A daily turn-
over of around 100,000 rights con-
tinues to hold the price down. Surely
this turnover will dry up when the
issue closes.
The portfolio now consists of:

More than 40
'single 7 whiskies
are married to make one
Johnnie Walker
When you pour yourself a Johnnie
Walker you have more than 40
‘single’ whiskies all in one glass
because it does take that many fine
whiskies to make one Johnnie
Walker. That’s the secret of
Johnnie Walker’s smoothness and
mellowness. And ’46 years’ skill in
blending. These different whiskies
come from all over Scotland. Rich,
characterful Glenlivets and
Highland malt whiskies tangy
with the faint taste of smoke from
peat fires. Smooth, rounded Islays.
And clean, fresh-tasting grain
whiskies from the Lowlands. Some
of these whiskies are matured as
long as fifteen years none less
than five. All very smooth. Very
mellow. No wonder Johnnie Walker
is the world’s best-loved Scotch. In
miniatures, 5 oz. and 13 oz. flasks,
13 oz. and 26 oz., square bottles.
